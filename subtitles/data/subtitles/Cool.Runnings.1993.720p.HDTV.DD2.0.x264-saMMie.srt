1
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:27,443
Ah, if I give the love
you know you won't forget

2
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:30,154
Girl, if I give the love
you know you won't forget

3
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,156
If I give the love
you know you won't forget

4
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:34,993
Girl, if I give the love
you know you won't forget

5
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:38,496
Come on to me, baby

6
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:42,667
And take my blues away

7
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:48,213
What I need to see now

8
00:00:48,338 --> 00:00:51,550
Is brighter days

9
00:00:53,802 --> 00:00:56,722
I want to take away
my dark skies

10
00:00:56,847 --> 00:00:59,141
Take away my tears

11
00:00:59,266 --> 00:01:01,268
Take away my sufferin'

12
00:01:01,393 --> 00:01:02,728
People feel for
all these years

13
00:01:02,853 --> 00:01:05,814
Ah, if I give the love
you know you won't forget

14
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:08,483
Girl, if I give the love
you know you won't forget

15
00:01:08,609 --> 00:01:10,611
If I give the love
you know you won't forget

16
00:01:10,736 --> 00:01:13,530
Girl, if I give the love
you know you won't forget

17
00:01:13,655 --> 00:01:17,200
Let this love light shine

18
00:01:17,326 --> 00:01:20,621
Let it in your soul

19
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:26,460
Steady on forever

20
00:01:26,585 --> 00:01:31,005
It's time to take control

21
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:35,217
- On your mark, get set, run!
- We don't need no darkness

22
00:01:35,343 --> 00:01:37,595
We don't need no fear

23
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,972
We don't need no sadness

24
00:01:40,097 --> 00:01:42,433
All we need is care

25
00:01:42,558 --> 00:01:47,271
Don't get upset
if you ain't got nobody

26
00:01:47,396 --> 00:01:51,567
Don't get upset
if you have no fun

27
00:01:51,692 --> 00:01:53,903
- Don't get angry
- Don't get upset

28
00:01:54,028 --> 00:01:56,530
- When you wake up in the mornin'
- Hey, Derice, where you runnin', man?

29
00:01:56,655 --> 00:01:59,033
- 'Cause it's a new day
- West.
- Mornin'. How are you?

30
00:01:59,158 --> 00:02:01,952
Life's just begun

31
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:06,415
Ooh, yeah
Give thanks and praises

32
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,292
- Hey there.
- Derice!

33
00:02:08,416 --> 00:02:11,628
- Yeah, man!
- Love is coming your way

34
00:02:20,929 --> 00:02:25,642
Don't get upset
if you ain't got nobody

35
00:02:25,767 --> 00:02:29,396
Don't get upset
if you have no fun

36
00:02:29,521 --> 00:02:32,148
- Don't get angry
- Don't get upset

37
00:02:32,273 --> 00:02:34,859
When you wake up
in the mornin'

38
00:02:34,984 --> 00:02:40,240
'Cause it's a new day
Life's just begun

39
00:02:40,365 --> 00:02:45,411
Ooh, yeah
Give thanks and praises

40
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:49,124
- Morning.
- Faster, Bannock, faster!

41
00:02:49,249 --> 00:02:52,793
Come on, child, you have
an Olympics to get to.

42
00:02:52,918 --> 00:02:55,712
Handsome as a lion, that one.

43
00:02:55,838 --> 00:02:59,341
I could watch that backside
all day.

44
00:03:01,301 --> 00:03:04,346
Come on!

45
00:03:04,471 --> 00:03:08,142
- Go! Come on!
- Ah, if I give the love
you know you won't forget

46
00:03:08,267 --> 00:03:11,019
Girl, if I give the love
you know you won't forget

47
00:03:11,061 --> 00:03:13,397
Take away my sadness

48
00:03:13,605 --> 00:03:15,858
Take away my tears

49
00:03:31,498 --> 00:03:33,374
Hey, Sanka.

50
00:03:33,499 --> 00:03:37,211
This steering wheel
is finished.

51
00:03:37,336 --> 00:03:40,214
All right, team, let's get ready
for the pre-race cheer. Ready?

52
00:03:40,339 --> 00:03:42,717
- Yes, sir!
- Ready?
- Yes, sir!

53
00:03:42,842 --> 00:03:46,387
All right,
one, two, three, toot!

54
00:03:46,512 --> 00:03:48,556
Who's the captain
of our crew?

55
00:03:48,681 --> 00:03:50,892
Who's a friend to me and you?

56
00:03:51,017 --> 00:03:55,396
Kind of nice, good-looking too.
Sanka! Sanka! Yea, Sanka!

57
00:03:56,522 --> 00:03:58,524
Get back to work!

58
00:03:58,649 --> 00:04:01,861
Who's the big hot bag of air who
doesn't have to comb his hair...

59
00:04:01,986 --> 00:04:04,280
who doesn't bathe
and doesn't care?

60
00:04:04,405 --> 00:04:08,117
- Sanka! Sanka! Sanka!
- Yea, Sanka! Hey!

61
00:04:08,242 --> 00:04:10,119
What's happenin', star?
Where you been, man?

62
00:04:10,244 --> 00:04:14,080
You almost missed my all-time world
record: Seventh derby in a row.

63
00:04:14,205 --> 00:04:17,334
Easy, Rasta. I'm not going to forget
my best friend on this day of days.

64
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:21,671
Derice, my grandfather says
you're definitely going to
make it to the Olympics.

65
00:04:21,796 --> 00:04:24,633
He says you're even faster
than your father.

66
00:04:24,758 --> 00:04:28,094
- Yeah, man, do it for Jamaica!
- Hey, you know what my grandfather says?

67
00:04:28,219 --> 00:04:30,388
- What?
- Get back to work!

68
00:04:30,513 --> 00:04:32,932
- Booie, booie!
- What are you talkin' about?

69
00:04:33,058 --> 00:04:35,935
Good luck, man. I'll see you
at the finish line, all right?

70
00:04:41,232 --> 00:04:43,443
- Hi, Momma Coffie.
- Hi, Derice.

71
00:04:43,568 --> 00:04:45,445
- Derice, is Sanka ready?
- Who knows?

72
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:47,947
Ready. That boy's never ready.

73
00:04:48,073 --> 00:04:51,951
He's a lazy, crazy, sorry,
no-good bag of bones.

74
00:04:52,077 --> 00:04:54,287
So what you laughing at?

75
00:04:55,871 --> 00:04:58,582
All pushcarts
to the start position!

76
00:04:58,707 --> 00:05:01,335
- Ready, little man?
- Ready, big man.

77
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,337
Kiss the lucky egg.

78
00:05:04,797 --> 00:05:06,590
Let's go!

79
00:05:08,092 --> 00:05:11,595
- On your marks...
- Feel the rhythm! Feel the rhyme!

80
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,181
Get on up!
It's pushcart time!

81
00:05:14,306 --> 00:05:16,475
And go!

82
00:05:21,271 --> 00:05:24,608
Here we go, Winston!
The Rockett has been launched!

83
00:05:24,733 --> 00:05:27,111
Hey, fruitcake!
Where'd you get that cart?

84
00:05:27,236 --> 00:05:30,114
Clear out!
Come on, move out! Look out!

85
00:05:32,074 --> 00:05:34,451
Sanka Coffie,
pushcart champion!

86
00:05:34,576 --> 00:05:37,537
- Pushcart champion!
- Get away! Get away!

87
00:05:37,662 --> 00:05:39,872
Hey, grandma, out of my way!

88
00:05:39,997 --> 00:05:45,336
Hey, Sunday driver, make room
for the Rasta Rockett! Make room!

89
00:05:45,461 --> 00:05:48,589
- Sanka, four more carts left!
- Pee Wee, move! Move out!

90
00:05:48,714 --> 00:05:52,844
I love Jamaica,
and Jamaica loves me!

91
00:05:52,969 --> 00:05:55,805
Champion! Champion!
You can't mess with the best!

92
00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:00,393
- Move over! Move over!
- Get away! Get off me!

93
00:06:00,518 --> 00:06:02,061
- Go, Sanka!
- Get him! Get him!

94
00:06:02,186 --> 00:06:05,565
One more cart left!
Go! Go! Go! Go!

95
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:07,817
Yes! We win!

96
00:06:12,155 --> 00:06:14,031
Jump, Winston, jump!

97
00:06:22,164 --> 00:06:24,040
Sanka!

98
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:33,175
Move it, man!
Move, move, move!

99
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,927
Sanka, you dead?

100
00:06:36,052 --> 00:06:37,929
Yeah, man.

101
00:06:43,101 --> 00:06:45,562
And where do you think
you're going?

102
00:06:45,687 --> 00:06:47,814
You caught me.

103
00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:51,401
- You have papers to grade.
- I'm just getting in one last run.

104
00:06:54,195 --> 00:06:57,073
I can't believe the tryouts
are finally here.

105
00:06:58,366 --> 00:07:01,452
- You nervous?
- I'm not nervous.

106
00:07:01,577 --> 00:07:05,789
I'm ready. I've been ready
for this day my whole life.

107
00:07:05,915 --> 00:07:10,002
I don't care how fast they run,
I'm going to run faster.

108
00:07:10,127 --> 00:07:14,506
I don't care how much
they want it, I want it more.

109
00:07:15,716 --> 00:07:17,593
I'm going to the Olympics, baby.

110
00:07:18,969 --> 00:07:22,348
I feel it.
I'm going to win the gold.

111
00:07:22,473 --> 00:07:26,352
Derice, are you nervous?

112
00:07:26,477 --> 00:07:28,354
I'm terrified.

113
00:07:34,109 --> 00:07:37,488
It's my turn, Joy!
It's my turn!

114
00:07:39,156 --> 00:07:42,492
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the final event...

115
00:07:42,617 --> 00:07:44,410
of today's Olympic tryouts.

116
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,333
We have now come to the
main event of our games...

117
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:54,212
the running
of the 100-metre finals.

118
00:07:54,337 --> 00:07:56,714
We've had a most
successful afternoon...

119
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:59,634
and I'd like to congratulate
all the athletes...

120
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,762
who have participated
in today's events.

121
00:08:02,887 --> 00:08:06,474
- You sure no one can beat him?
- Oh, sure, I'm sure.

122
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:08,810
I'm just a little concerned
about that big baldy.

123
00:08:14,774 --> 00:08:17,985
Let me first congratulate our athletes
on a splendid performance...

124
00:08:18,111 --> 00:08:21,614
and let me remind them that
only the top four finishers...

125
00:08:21,739 --> 00:08:27,452
will earn the right to represent
Jamaica in the forthcoming
summer games in Seoul, Korea.

126
00:08:27,577 --> 00:08:30,664
Wait. Y-You're Derice Bannock,
right?

127
00:08:30,789 --> 00:08:34,000
- That's me.
- Oh. I hope I make the team.

128
00:08:34,126 --> 00:08:39,589
- It would be a real honor to
run with you. Good luck to you.
- Good luck to you.

129
00:08:39,714 --> 00:08:43,051
Derice Bannock.
Hey, good luck to you too.

130
00:08:46,304 --> 00:08:49,015
Runners, take your marks.

131
00:08:59,943 --> 00:09:02,028
Get set!

132
00:09:47,071 --> 00:09:50,116
Mr. Coolidge, please,
you have to run the race over!

133
00:09:50,241 --> 00:09:52,744
I'm sorry, Derice.
Nothing can be done.

134
00:09:52,869 --> 00:09:54,829
But I was born to compete
in the Olympics!

135
00:09:54,954 --> 00:09:57,582
Then you're going to have to work
on your boxing or your cycling.

136
00:09:57,707 --> 00:10:00,418
Those are the only other two sports
in which Jamaica competes.

137
00:10:00,543 --> 00:10:03,463
I am not a boxer,
I am a runner.

138
00:10:03,588 --> 00:10:05,965
And it wasn't fair.

139
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:09,427
It rarely is, my boy.
It rarely is.

140
00:10:13,097 --> 00:10:17,393
Well, Papa, what do I do now?

141
00:10:17,518 --> 00:10:21,856
Look, Derice, let it go, eh?
Let it go.

142
00:10:21,981 --> 00:10:24,651
You'll have another chance
in four years.

143
00:10:25,902 --> 00:10:27,778
Yeah.

144
00:10:29,863 --> 00:10:31,740
Mr. Coolidge...

145
00:10:31,865 --> 00:10:34,451
who is the other man in
the picture with my father?

146
00:10:34,576 --> 00:10:37,079
Irving Blitzer. He's an
American who lives here.

147
00:10:37,204 --> 00:10:40,791
- Unless, of course, he's
been arrested or shot.
- Excuse me?

148
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:42,876
Well, he's a bookie now.

149
00:10:43,001 --> 00:10:46,463
Takes his bets in a small
pool hall just past Sandy Bay.

150
00:10:46,588 --> 00:10:49,675
- Isn't that a gold medal
around his neck?
- Oh, yeah.

151
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:55,305
That lunatic was an Olympic
bobsledder who tried to get
your father to switch sports.

152
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:59,976
He had some theory about using
track sprinters to push the bobsleds.

153
00:11:00,102 --> 00:11:02,604
Some ridiculous
thing like that.

154
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:05,315
Can you imagine
a Jamaican bobsledder?

155
00:11:07,943 --> 00:11:10,820
And you're sure this man,
he lives on the island?

156
00:11:10,945 --> 00:11:12,988
- Oh, yes.
- Mr. Coolidge, thanks a lot.

157
00:11:13,114 --> 00:11:16,367
- Good, Derice.
- Oh, could I borrow this picture?

158
00:11:16,492 --> 00:11:20,663
- Bring it back!
- Yes, sir. Thanks a lot, Mr. Coolidge.

159
00:11:20,788 --> 00:11:24,208
- Oh, just one more thing.
- Mmm?

160
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:26,669
What's a bobsled?

161
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:30,423
That's a bobsled.

162
00:11:30,548 --> 00:11:34,343
Oh. So a bobsled is
a pushcart with no wheels.

163
00:11:34,468 --> 00:11:37,513
- That's what it looks like here.
- Let me see that.

164
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:45,229
All right. "The key elements
for a successful sled team...

165
00:11:45,354 --> 00:11:49,817
are a steady driver
and three strong runners
to push off down the ice."

166
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:53,153
Ice? Ice?

167
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:55,155
Well...

168
00:11:56,781 --> 00:11:58,700
it's kind of a
winter sport, you know.

169
00:11:58,825 --> 00:12:02,871
- You mean winter, as in ice?
- Maybe.

170
00:12:02,996 --> 00:12:07,625
You mean winter, as in igloos
and Eskimos and penguins and ice?

171
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,336
- Possibly.
- See you.

172
00:12:10,462 --> 00:12:12,338
Where you going?

173
00:12:12,464 --> 00:12:15,425
I'm going to take a hot bath.
I'm getting cold just thinking
about all this ice.

174
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:20,180
- No, man! You're going to be
part of my bobsled team!
- What do you need me for?

175
00:12:20,305 --> 00:12:24,726
Who is the best pushcart driver
in all o' Jamaica?

176
00:12:24,851 --> 00:12:26,728
- You're looking at him?
- Then you're going to do it?

177
00:12:26,853 --> 00:12:28,897
No!

178
00:12:29,022 --> 00:12:31,107
Hey, man, you could be famous.

179
00:12:31,232 --> 00:12:34,735
You could have your picture
on a Wheaties box.

180
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:38,864
But you said "no," and that's
all right, because I don't need you.

181
00:12:38,989 --> 00:12:42,409
Everybody is going to want
to be on my bobsled team!

182
00:12:42,534 --> 00:12:45,704
Look, star, let me tell you
a little something, all right?

183
00:12:45,829 --> 00:12:49,249
When you need something from me, you
don't have to hand me a bunch of lines.

184
00:12:49,374 --> 00:12:52,753
All you have to do is
look at me in the eye and say,
"Sanka, you are my best friend.

185
00:12:52,878 --> 00:12:56,089
We been through a whole heap together
and I really, really need you."

186
00:12:59,635 --> 00:13:03,013
Sanka, you're right.
And you are my best friend.

187
00:13:03,138 --> 00:13:05,849
- And we've been through
a whole lot together.
- Heap. Heap.

188
00:13:05,974 --> 00:13:08,810
Sorry, man.
Whole heap together.

189
00:13:08,936 --> 00:13:13,482
- "And I really, really need you."
- And I really, really need you.

190
00:13:13,607 --> 00:13:15,524
- Forget it.
- But you just said if I said that...

191
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:19,528
All right.
All right, all right. All right, man.

192
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,907
So, let's talk about
this bill-sled team.

193
00:13:23,032 --> 00:13:25,743
- No, bobsled team.
- Whoever.

194
00:13:25,868 --> 00:13:29,622
Now, about the Wheaties box...
I'm going to be on it by myself, right?

195
00:13:29,747 --> 00:13:32,041
No, man, you're going to
be on it with me.

196
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:34,543
And down the stretch they come!
Tumbleweed is holding on...

197
00:13:34,669 --> 00:13:36,921
- as Captain Video makes it
all the way on the outside.
- Yes, Tumbleweed, yes!

198
00:13:37,046 --> 00:13:39,423
- Come on! That's it!
- Brewster is dropping back
as Tumbleweed holds the rail.

199
00:13:39,548 --> 00:13:41,717
- Good Tumbleweed! Good Tumbleweed!
- And here comes Captain Video
on the outside!

200
00:13:41,842 --> 00:13:46,305
- Tumbleweed is slowing!
- No, Tumbleweed! No! Bad
Tumbleweed! What are you doing?

201
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:48,849
- Tumbleweed can't hold it and he
gets pinned against the rail.
- What? Don't do...

202
00:13:48,975 --> 00:13:51,018
- It's anyone's race
as they approach the rail!
- Don't do that! Let him out!

203
00:13:51,143 --> 00:13:53,354
- Captain Video makes his move!
Tumbleweed is running gamely...
- No! I need this one!

204
00:13:53,479 --> 00:13:55,981
- But Captain Video seems
just a little bit too strong!
- Please! Come on!

205
00:13:56,106 --> 00:13:57,983
- Here they come!
- No!

206
00:13:58,108 --> 00:14:01,152
Yes! Tumbleweed can't hold it,
as Captain Video takes charge.

207
00:14:01,277 --> 00:14:04,531
And it's Brewster finishing in second,
Susan's Pride finishes third...

208
00:14:04,656 --> 00:14:06,783
and Tumbleweed
is nowhere in sight!

209
00:14:06,908 --> 00:14:09,160
But, my, oh, my,
the odds-on favorite...

210
00:14:09,285 --> 00:14:11,830
- showed his true colors
with that late-stretch run.
- That's all right. Uh-huh.

211
00:14:11,955 --> 00:14:14,165
Tumbleweed held on momentarily,
but realistically...

212
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:16,376
only a fool would put
their money on Tumbleweed.

213
00:14:16,501 --> 00:14:18,378
That horse had no chance of...

214
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:25,927
That guy won two gold medals?

215
00:14:28,805 --> 00:14:30,390
I think so.

216
00:14:36,229 --> 00:14:38,522
That's Tumbleweed gone.

217
00:14:38,647 --> 00:14:40,399
Okay, next race.

218
00:14:43,777 --> 00:14:47,197
Excuse me. Are you
Mr. Irving Blitzer?

219
00:14:47,322 --> 00:14:49,533
Well, that depends
on who's asking.

220
00:14:49,658 --> 00:14:53,203
My name is Derice Bannock.
This is my teammate Sanka Coffie.

221
00:14:53,328 --> 00:14:55,581
Greetings, sled god.

222
00:14:55,706 --> 00:15:01,336
We were just wondering if you'd
be interested in coaching the
first Jamaican bobsled team.

223
00:15:02,755 --> 00:15:05,382
Derice, remember the radio?
Radio?

224
00:15:05,507 --> 00:15:08,427
Stick. Shooting with the stick.
Let's go!

225
00:15:08,552 --> 00:15:10,429
Let's go, Derice!

226
00:15:23,608 --> 00:15:25,943
Come on, Coach.

227
00:15:26,068 --> 00:15:27,945
Just help me get started!

228
00:15:41,042 --> 00:15:42,919
- Greetings, sled god.
- Sorry to bother you...

229
00:15:43,044 --> 00:15:45,379
- Get out! Get out!
- But you're the only one
that can help us!

230
00:15:54,472 --> 00:15:56,641
- Go away.
- Okay.

231
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:00,102
Nice to meet you!

232
00:16:00,228 --> 00:16:03,355
- Maybe today is a bad day.
- Yeah.

233
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:07,442
I'll come back tomorrow, and
the next day, and the next day,

234
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:09,444
- No. No!
- And the next day.

235
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:11,988
- Look, whatever you're name is...
- Derice.

236
00:16:12,113 --> 00:16:15,533
All right, Derice, let me lay
out some difficulties for you.

237
00:16:15,659 --> 00:16:17,869
Snow... you don't have any.

238
00:16:17,994 --> 00:16:20,247
It's 900 degrees out there.

239
00:16:20,372 --> 00:16:22,249
Time... you don't have any.

240
00:16:22,374 --> 00:16:24,459
The Olympics
are in three months.

241
00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:27,754
And me... you don't have me.

242
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:31,258
As far as I'm concerned, the sport
of bobsledding no longer exists.

243
00:16:31,383 --> 00:16:33,843
I don't want to do it,
I don't want to coach it...

244
00:16:33,969 --> 00:16:37,097
and most of all...
and I mean most of all...

245
00:16:37,222 --> 00:16:41,476
I don't want to be within
2,000 miles of anyone who does.

246
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:46,146
- Now, did you follow all that?
- Then how come you still have
that poster on the wall?

247
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:50,651
Is that what's bothering you?

248
00:16:54,655 --> 00:16:57,491
There. Is that better?

249
00:16:57,616 --> 00:16:59,493
Are you happy?

250
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:10,504
Like I said,
my name is Derice Bannock.

251
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:12,631
I'm Ben Bannock's son.

252
00:17:17,177 --> 00:17:20,681
I haven't seen this picture
in twenty years.

253
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:22,850
Huh! Would you look at me then.

254
00:17:24,934 --> 00:17:30,314
- Ooh. Would you look at me now?
- Please, Mr. Blitzer.

255
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,066
Just give me a chance.

256
00:17:32,191 --> 00:17:34,152
If I don't have what it takes,
we forget the whole thing.

257
00:17:34,277 --> 00:17:39,323
- Believe me, kid, you do not
have what it takes.
- But you thought my father did.

258
00:17:39,449 --> 00:17:44,036
Your father was one of
the toughest competitors I ever saw.

259
00:17:44,162 --> 00:17:46,998
He ran the 100 meters
in ten-flat.

260
00:17:47,123 --> 00:17:49,041
Well, I run it in 9.9.

261
00:17:52,503 --> 00:17:55,590
Come on. Coach me.

262
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:01,804
Sorry. You're a couple
decades late.

263
00:18:01,929 --> 00:18:04,223
Oh, I see. Well, it might be
easy for you...

264
00:18:04,348 --> 00:18:06,224
to walk away from me,
Mr. Blitzer...

265
00:18:06,349 --> 00:18:08,226
but you can't walk away
from this:

266
00:18:08,351 --> 00:18:11,146
20 years ago you came down here
to see if you could make...

267
00:18:11,271 --> 00:18:13,440
a Jamaican sprinter
into a bobsledder...

268
00:18:13,565 --> 00:18:15,901
and you never got that chance.

269
00:18:16,026 --> 00:18:18,111
Look at me, Mr. Blitzer.

270
00:18:18,236 --> 00:18:20,113
I'm your chance.

271
00:18:20,238 --> 00:18:22,282
Take it.

272
00:18:33,502 --> 00:18:35,795
All right, everyone quiet down.

273
00:18:35,921 --> 00:18:37,881
Nice group here.

274
00:18:38,006 --> 00:18:41,593
Now, for two of you lucky people,
our trip to the Olympics...

275
00:18:41,718 --> 00:18:43,595
starts right now.

276
00:18:44,971 --> 00:18:46,932
And I want to introduce you...

277
00:18:47,056 --> 00:18:49,225
to Mr. Irving Blitzer...

278
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:52,770
who's going to be
our expert bobsled coach.

279
00:18:54,396 --> 00:18:56,815
Sanka, hit it, man.

280
00:18:56,941 --> 00:18:59,318
You're on the air, sled god!

281
00:19:02,446 --> 00:19:06,784
- Gentlemen, a bobsled
is a simple thing.
- Yeah! So's a toilet!

282
00:19:09,245 --> 00:19:12,164
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

283
00:19:12,289 --> 00:19:15,125
Basically, what you're looking to do
is get your sorry rear ends...

284
00:19:15,251 --> 00:19:18,921
from the top of an icy chute
to the bottom.

285
00:19:19,046 --> 00:19:22,299
You're ziggin',
you're zaggin'.

286
00:19:22,424 --> 00:19:26,595
It's the biggest, coldest roller
coaster you've ever been on.

287
00:19:28,389 --> 00:19:30,306
I-Ice.

288
00:19:35,937 --> 00:19:37,689
Oh, yeah.

289
00:19:37,814 --> 00:19:40,108
Oh, yeah.

290
00:19:40,233 --> 00:19:42,193
I almost forgot, uh...

291
00:19:42,318 --> 00:19:45,196
One minor drawback to this
delightful winter sport...

292
00:19:45,321 --> 00:19:48,116
is the high-speed crash.

293
00:19:48,241 --> 00:19:50,368
That hurt. Aah.

294
00:19:50,493 --> 00:19:54,914
Always remember, your bones
will not break in a bobsled.

295
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:57,041
No, no. They shatter.

296
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:06,050
So...

297
00:20:06,175 --> 00:20:08,052
who wants in?

298
00:20:22,024 --> 00:20:23,900
Look, Baldy's here.

299
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:30,741
- Glad you could make it, man!
- Don't touch me!

300
00:20:30,866 --> 00:20:34,036
No problem. So what's your name?

301
00:20:34,161 --> 00:20:36,038
Yul Brenner.

302
00:20:39,207 --> 00:20:42,711
Well, it's good to have you
as a teammate, Brenner.

303
00:20:42,836 --> 00:20:45,547
Let's get one thing straight,
Bannock.

304
00:20:45,672 --> 00:20:47,924
We may be on the same team...

305
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:50,343
but I am no one's teammate.

306
00:20:50,469 --> 00:20:52,970
- Long as you come here to bobsled.
- Hey, listen, man...

307
00:20:53,095 --> 00:20:55,264
the only reason why
I come here...

308
00:20:55,389 --> 00:20:58,893
is to get off of this
stinkin' island.

309
00:20:59,018 --> 00:21:01,896
If I have to take one
of those bobsleds to do it...

310
00:21:02,021 --> 00:21:04,065
then all right.

311
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:07,067
- No problem.
- Uh, yes.

312
00:21:07,193 --> 00:21:11,405
Yes, I have a problem. There's
no such thing as a three-man sled.

313
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:14,658
- You're one Jamaican short.
- Hey.

314
00:21:17,203 --> 00:21:19,789
The meeting start yet?

315
00:21:19,914 --> 00:21:21,791
- Uh-oh.
- You!

316
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:25,628
- I'll kill you.
College boy, I'll kill you!
- Wait! Hold on!

317
00:21:25,753 --> 00:21:28,756
- Hey, hey! Lighten up!
Whoa! Whoa! Down, boy!
- Wait a second!

318
00:21:28,881 --> 00:21:32,259
- He didn't mean anything!
He didn't mean it!
- You're dead! You're dead!

319
00:21:32,384 --> 00:21:35,261
Kill him,
and we don't have a team.

320
00:21:35,386 --> 00:21:39,224
- I'm not riding
in the same sled as that.
- He tripped me too, you know.

321
00:21:39,349 --> 00:21:43,102
But in case you haven't noticed,
there's no one else here.

322
00:21:43,228 --> 00:21:45,980
You're crowding me, slinky head.

323
00:21:46,105 --> 00:21:48,107
Slinky head.
That's a good one.

324
00:21:48,233 --> 00:21:50,610
- What are you laughing about?
- Nothing.

325
00:21:50,735 --> 00:21:55,073
If it wasn't for you, rich boy,
I'd be in the Olympics right now.

326
00:21:55,198 --> 00:21:57,075
I don't know what
you all are arguing about...

327
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,371
- 'cause Derice was going to
beat both your butts anyway.
- What are you talking about?

328
00:22:01,496 --> 00:22:03,414
How 'bout I beat your butt
right now?

329
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:06,793
How 'bout I draw a line down the middle
of your head so it looks like a butt?

330
00:22:13,258 --> 00:22:15,551
Forget it, man. I'm gone.

331
00:22:15,676 --> 00:22:19,972
Fine. Stay here on the island.
We're going to Canada.

332
00:22:25,102 --> 00:22:27,062
All right.

333
00:22:27,187 --> 00:22:29,273
I'll do it.

334
00:22:29,398 --> 00:22:33,151
But you'd better tell
this mama's boy...

335
00:22:33,277 --> 00:22:35,571
to stay the hell
away from me.

336
00:22:35,696 --> 00:22:38,115
You understand?

337
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,117
No problem.

338
00:22:41,451 --> 00:22:43,328
Hey, Irv...

339
00:22:43,453 --> 00:22:48,083
say hello to the first
Jamaican bobsled team.

340
00:22:55,215 --> 00:22:57,091
Oh, goody.

341
00:22:59,051 --> 00:23:02,972
Gentlemen, this is a bobsled.

342
00:23:03,097 --> 00:23:05,141
Sort of.

343
00:23:05,266 --> 00:23:08,602
- All right, here's what
we're going to do. Yul...
- Don't touch me.

344
00:23:08,728 --> 00:23:12,690
Of course. Sorry. You're going
to be the second middle man.

345
00:23:12,815 --> 00:23:16,277
You're strong, you're fast, and
you're going to love that seat.

346
00:23:16,402 --> 00:23:18,904
Junior, you're the first
middle man.

347
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:22,074
You're quick, you're sharp.
Hop in.

348
00:23:22,199 --> 00:23:24,243
- Sanka...
- I know... I'm the driver, right?

349
00:23:24,368 --> 00:23:27,371
- No, you're the brake man.
- No... No, I'm the driver.

350
00:23:27,496 --> 00:23:30,207
No, you're not.
You're the brake man.

351
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:33,586
- I'm the driver.
- You're not! You're the brake man.

352
00:23:33,711 --> 00:23:35,671
See, you don't understand!
I am Sanka Coffie!

353
00:23:35,796 --> 00:23:38,339
I'm the best pushcart driver
in all of Jamaica!

354
00:23:38,465 --> 00:23:41,926
I must drive! Do you dig
where I'm coming from?

355
00:23:42,052 --> 00:23:43,928
- Yeah, I dig where you're coming from.
- Good.

356
00:23:44,054 --> 00:23:47,223
Now dig where I'm coming from.
I'm coming from two gold medals.

357
00:23:47,348 --> 00:23:50,810
I'm coming from nine world records
in both the two and four-man events.

358
00:23:50,935 --> 00:23:55,774
I'm coming from ten years of
intense competition with the
best athletes in the world.

359
00:23:55,899 --> 00:23:58,151
That's a hell of a place
to be coming from.

360
00:23:58,276 --> 00:24:01,863
You see, Sanka, the driver
has to work harder than anyone.

361
00:24:01,988 --> 00:24:04,908
He's the first to show up
and the last to leave.

362
00:24:05,033 --> 00:24:09,704
When his teammates are all out
drinking beer, he's up in his
room studying pictures of turns.

363
00:24:09,829 --> 00:24:14,459
You see, a driver must remain focused
one hundred percent at all times.

364
00:24:14,584 --> 00:24:18,463
Not only is he responsible for knowing
every inch of every course he races...

365
00:24:18,588 --> 00:24:22,091
he's also responsible for the lives
of the other three people in his sled.

366
00:24:24,384 --> 00:24:26,261
Now, do you want
that responsibility?

367
00:24:26,386 --> 00:24:28,847
I say we make Derice
the driver.

368
00:24:28,972 --> 00:24:31,934
So do I, Sanka, so do I.

369
00:24:36,522 --> 00:24:39,149
Oh, the back is nice.

370
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,820
All right, Father, listen here.

371
00:24:42,945 --> 00:24:46,573
You see, I've made up my mind.
I'm going to be a bobsledder.

372
00:24:47,908 --> 00:24:50,994
That's right. A bobsledder.

373
00:24:52,412 --> 00:24:54,289
Oh, really?

374
00:24:54,414 --> 00:24:57,543
Well, I'm sorry
you feel that way.

375
00:24:57,668 --> 00:25:00,671
Fine. Cut off my allowance.

376
00:25:00,796 --> 00:25:03,130
Because you see, Father...

377
00:25:03,256 --> 00:25:07,510
a man has got to do
what a man has got to do.

378
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:20,147
Just who I wanted to see.

379
00:25:20,273 --> 00:25:24,652
- M-M-Me?
- You know where I just came from?

380
00:25:24,777 --> 00:25:28,322
- W-Where?
- I got you a job...

381
00:25:28,447 --> 00:25:33,619
with Webster, Webster and Cohen,
the biggest brokerage house in Miami!

382
00:25:33,744 --> 00:25:37,456
- Oh, right. Webster, Webster and Cohen.
- Yes! That's right.

383
00:25:37,582 --> 00:25:40,334
And you start end of the month.

384
00:25:42,962 --> 00:25:45,839
- Yes, but I thought that I would...
- Look...

385
00:25:45,964 --> 00:25:49,801
we went along with this
track nonsense long enough.

386
00:25:49,926 --> 00:25:54,973
And we agreed that it's time to
get on with your real future. Right?

387
00:25:56,474 --> 00:25:59,311
- I know...
- Right?

388
00:25:59,436 --> 00:26:01,896
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

389
00:26:05,525 --> 00:26:07,736
I'm going to tell your mother.

390
00:26:18,913 --> 00:26:21,166
I guess we sure told him.

391
00:26:24,002 --> 00:26:28,839
Winning a bobsled race
is about one thing: The push start.

392
00:26:28,964 --> 00:26:32,343
Now, I know you dainty little
track stars think you're fast.

393
00:26:32,468 --> 00:26:35,012
Well, heh, let's see
how fast you are...

394
00:26:35,137 --> 00:26:38,432
when you push
a 600-pound sled.

395
00:26:38,557 --> 00:26:42,269
Now, a respectable start time
is 5.7 seconds.

396
00:26:42,394 --> 00:26:45,397
If you speed demons can't
whip off an even six-flat...

397
00:26:45,522 --> 00:26:48,567
you have a better chance of
becoming a barbershop quartet.

398
00:26:50,194 --> 00:26:52,529
Derice, come on! Hey!

399
00:26:52,654 --> 00:26:55,032
Junior, get in! Never mind!

400
00:26:57,242 --> 00:26:59,912
We'll have to move it back.
Let's go!

401
00:27:00,037 --> 00:27:04,750
- Here on this mountain top Whoa-oh
- Slow down! What are you
doing to me? Slow down!

402
00:27:04,875 --> 00:27:07,418
- I got some wild, wild life
- 14.3. No good.

403
00:27:07,543 --> 00:27:10,588
- I've got some bills
to pay, whoa-oh
- 13.5. 11.7.

404
00:27:10,713 --> 00:27:13,466
This is what it's all about!
This is where you win or lose the race!

405
00:27:13,591 --> 00:27:16,135
Right here in the pushcart! This
is where you're gonna practice!

406
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,638
Right here! Right here in the
Volkswagen, you're gonna practice!

407
00:27:18,763 --> 00:27:22,308
No, Junior, quit falling down!
Come on, hustle!

408
00:27:22,433 --> 00:27:24,644
Catch up to them!
There you go!

409
00:27:24,769 --> 00:27:27,897
Junior! No! Do it again!

410
00:27:28,022 --> 00:27:31,484
Whoa, whoa! Stop! Stop, Derice!
Stop! Wait! Wait for me!

411
00:27:31,609 --> 00:27:34,487
Wait! I'm in! Stop!
Slow down!

412
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:42,120
- Great. Very good. Try it again.
- Wild, wild life

413
00:27:42,245 --> 00:27:45,832
If I've said it once,
I've said it 46 times.

414
00:27:45,957 --> 00:27:49,501
Cold weather endurance is vital
to building a successful sled team.

415
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:56,132
- Cold enough?
- Wild, wild life

416
00:27:56,258 --> 00:28:00,887
- You got to live your life
You got to live your life
- One, two, three!

417
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:03,473
Wild, wild life

418
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:10,146
- Wild, wild life
- Go! Go! Go!

419
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:19,906
- Here on this mountain top Whoa-oh
- Whoa! Slow down!

420
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:23,493
- Sanka, hit the brakes!
Hit the brakes, man!
- I can't! It's stuck!

421
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:24,828
Hold on!

422
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:31,208
About some wild, wild life

423
00:28:43,345 --> 00:28:46,223
Sanka, you dead?

424
00:28:46,348 --> 00:28:47,975
Yeah, man.

425
00:28:50,102 --> 00:28:54,148
What have you done to the
police unit? I shall arrest you!

426
00:28:54,273 --> 00:28:57,693
- Who owns this thing?
- We do, sir.

427
00:28:57,818 --> 00:29:01,697
- And who are you?
- The Jamaican bobsled team, sir.

428
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:08,996
Don't give me that business.
I wasn't born yesterday.

429
00:29:09,121 --> 00:29:12,040
5.9! 5.9!
You did it! You did it!

430
00:29:12,165 --> 00:29:15,501
5.9! We did it!
We did it! 5.9!

431
00:29:15,627 --> 00:29:19,213
Get out of the way. Get out
of the way. 5.9, guys. What?

432
00:29:19,339 --> 00:29:22,216
- Who are you?
- I'm their coach! You guys okay?

433
00:29:22,342 --> 00:29:23,843
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- How's the sled?

434
00:29:23,968 --> 00:29:26,179
- Yeah, man, we're fine.
- Sled's okay?

435
00:29:26,304 --> 00:29:28,181
Well, it's in the wrong place!
Get it back to the top of the hill!

436
00:29:28,306 --> 00:29:31,225
Let's move it right now, you slackers!
Move it! Let's hustle! Come on!

437
00:29:31,351 --> 00:29:34,062
Let's move it!
Come on, you guys! Move it!

438
00:29:35,855 --> 00:29:38,900
I'm not asking for
a winter sports programme.

439
00:29:39,025 --> 00:29:43,613
All I need is a lousy 20 grand so I can
get us to the Olympics. That's all.

440
00:29:43,738 --> 00:29:46,532
How in God's name are you
going to get to the Olympics?

441
00:29:46,657 --> 00:29:49,077
These boys have never even
seen a sled race before!

442
00:29:49,202 --> 00:29:53,121
Mr. Coolidge, I have been looking at
sledders since I was twelve years old.

443
00:29:53,246 --> 00:29:57,084
If I say these kids can make it
to the Olympics, they can make
it to the Olympics.

444
00:29:57,209 --> 00:30:00,629
Okay. Well, I'll tell you
what we'll do.

445
00:30:00,754 --> 00:30:04,633
Practice down here with
the boys a bit more, and when
you're a little further along...

446
00:30:04,758 --> 00:30:07,427
- I'll come along and see you...
- No! No! No!

447
00:30:07,552 --> 00:30:10,389
Now, just a minute,
Mr. Blitzer.

448
00:30:10,514 --> 00:30:12,933
This country enjoys
a fine athletic tradition...

449
00:30:13,058 --> 00:30:15,394
and if you think I'm going to give you
the little money we have...

450
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:18,980
so that you can parade us around in
front of the world like a freak show...

451
00:30:19,106 --> 00:30:20,982
you've got another thing coming.

452
00:30:21,108 --> 00:30:24,152
It's bad enough how you
embarrassed your own country.

453
00:30:24,277 --> 00:30:26,655
I'm certainly not going to
allow you to embarrass ours.

454
00:30:29,241 --> 00:30:31,118
No go, kid.

455
00:30:32,744 --> 00:30:34,954
That's okay, Coach.
We'll get the money.

456
00:30:35,079 --> 00:30:38,582
- Do the words "give up"
mean anything to you?
- Not a thing.

457
00:30:40,209 --> 00:30:43,003
Some people say you know
they can't believe

458
00:30:43,129 --> 00:30:45,464
Jamaica
We have a bobsled team

459
00:30:45,589 --> 00:30:48,759
'Nuff people say you know
they can't believe

460
00:30:48,884 --> 00:30:51,095
Jamaica
We have a bobsled team

461
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:55,641
Hi. I'm here to offer you an
opportunity of a lifetime.

462
00:30:55,766 --> 00:30:58,978
We're looking for a sponsor
for the first Jamaican bobsled team.

463
00:32:20,932 --> 00:32:22,809
Oh!

464
00:32:26,647 --> 00:32:30,067
We have the one Derice
and the one Junior

465
00:32:30,192 --> 00:32:33,236
I'll pay you a dollar
to shut up!

466
00:32:37,032 --> 00:32:41,827
We got nine dollars and fifty-two cents
from Yul Brenner, thank you.

467
00:32:41,952 --> 00:32:44,455
We got a hundred and eighty-four
dollars from Derice and me.

468
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:47,458
Sanka, how did your singing
on the street go?

469
00:32:49,543 --> 00:32:51,712
How did it go?

470
00:32:51,837 --> 00:32:53,714
It went like this:

471
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:55,966
'Nuff people say you know
they can't believe

472
00:32:56,092 --> 00:32:58,260
- Sanka, we know.
- Jamaica, we have a bobsled team

473
00:32:58,386 --> 00:32:59,762
- Sanka.
- We have the one Derice...

474
00:32:59,887 --> 00:33:02,765
How much?

475
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:06,227
- I made a dollar and sixteen cents.
- Oh, that's great.

476
00:33:06,352 --> 00:33:08,896
We're only short about
nineteen thousand bucks.

477
00:33:09,021 --> 00:33:11,440
- Sorry I'm late, everybody.
- No, really, that is terrific.

478
00:33:11,565 --> 00:33:14,735
Don't pack a suitcase, Junior.
We're not going.

479
00:33:15,861 --> 00:33:17,738
Mmm, that's too bad.

480
00:33:21,825 --> 00:33:24,828
- Whoa!
- Oh! Where'd you get it, man?

481
00:33:24,953 --> 00:33:28,915
- I sold my car.
- Yes, man.

482
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,918
- I am going.
- No, we're not.

483
00:33:32,043 --> 00:33:35,004
Look here, Junior, I appreciate
what you're trying to do here...

484
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:37,966
but we can't accept this money;
it just wouldn't be proper.

485
00:33:38,091 --> 00:33:41,094
Uh, Derice, if I hadn't
tripped you fellas...

486
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:45,473
we'd already have been going
to the Olympics; I want you to have it.

487
00:33:51,437 --> 00:33:53,815
You mean you want us
to have it, right?

488
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:56,025
Right. Us.

489
00:33:58,236 --> 00:34:00,864
Thanks a lot, Junior.
Thanks a whole heap, man.

490
00:34:00,989 --> 00:34:06,034
Remember, this doesn't mean
that I like you, you understand?

491
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:10,330
Be sure to thank your father for
us, 'cause Lord knows, he didn't
have to let you sell that car.

492
00:34:10,455 --> 00:34:13,208
Well, uh, he doesn't know
I sold the car.

493
00:34:13,333 --> 00:34:17,588
Um, he doesn't know
I'm on the team.

494
00:34:17,713 --> 00:34:20,132
He thinks I'm off to Miami...

495
00:34:20,257 --> 00:34:22,134
and I loaned the car
to a friend...

496
00:34:22,259 --> 00:34:26,346
to work for Webster, Webster
and Cohen, someplace like that.

497
00:34:27,806 --> 00:34:30,434
Some people say you know
them can't believe

498
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:32,519
Jamaica
We have a bobsled team

499
00:34:32,644 --> 00:34:35,898
- Yes!
- We have the one Derice
- And the one Junior

500
00:34:36,023 --> 00:34:38,025
Yu... Sanka

501
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:41,028
The fastest of the fastest
of Jamaican sprinters

502
00:34:41,153 --> 00:34:43,155
Go to Olympics
Fight for Jamaica

503
00:35:23,235 --> 00:35:29,074
Welcome to Calgary, Alberta, Canada,
home of the 1988 Winter Olympic Games.

504
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:32,285
- This is it.
- We hope you all enjoy your stay.

505
00:36:07,403 --> 00:36:10,489
Sanka, man, what you smokin'?

506
00:36:10,614 --> 00:36:13,242
I'm not smokin'.
I'm breathin'.

507
00:36:16,078 --> 00:36:19,915
- All right, fellas,
this is us. Let's go!
- Move! Let's go! Move!

508
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:22,334
- Aah! Me first!
- What's the matter? You guys cold?

509
00:36:23,919 --> 00:36:27,131
It's not so much the heat; it's
the humidity that'll kill you.

510
00:37:13,259 --> 00:37:15,928
Excuse me, do you know where
you can register for bobsled?

511
00:37:21,517 --> 00:37:23,895
Do you know where you
register for bobsled?

512
00:37:29,734 --> 00:37:31,610
- See you.
- I'll see you around.

513
00:37:34,154 --> 00:37:37,199
- Okay, Mike, good to see you again.
- Ja?

514
00:37:37,324 --> 00:37:39,201
- Take care. All the best.
- Ja? Okay, ja.

515
00:37:41,161 --> 00:37:44,122
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I'd like to
register for the tryouts.

516
00:37:44,247 --> 00:37:47,083
- What country?
- Uh, Jamaica.

517
00:37:47,209 --> 00:37:48,877
What country?

518
00:37:49,002 --> 00:37:50,503
Jamaica.

519
00:37:53,965 --> 00:37:58,178
Well, what do you know?
A Jamaican bobsled team.

520
00:37:58,303 --> 00:38:00,221
Okay, here it is.

521
00:38:00,347 --> 00:38:04,392
Uh, it says here your qualifying run
will be held on the evening of the 10th.

522
00:38:04,517 --> 00:38:07,437
Your judges will be Shindler,
Gremmer and Kroychzech.

523
00:38:07,562 --> 00:38:11,441
- I know Kroychzech. He's a good guy.
- Yeah.

524
00:38:11,566 --> 00:38:16,904
In order to qualify, you must
complete the course safely in 1
minute, 2 seconds-flat or under.

525
00:38:17,029 --> 00:38:19,865
- Used to be a minute, five.
- Yeah.

526
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:22,076
Times change.

527
00:38:27,414 --> 00:38:30,542
- Irv, is that you?
- Roger, how you doing?

528
00:38:30,668 --> 00:38:33,087
Hello, Kurt.
Been a long time.

529
00:38:35,881 --> 00:38:38,175
Obviously not long enough.

530
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:42,262
- Hello, Larry.
- Jesus Christ, Irv.

531
00:38:42,388 --> 00:38:44,556
What the hell did you
do to yourself?

532
00:38:46,642 --> 00:38:49,186
- Don't worry about them, Irv.
- Roger, you got to do me a favor.

533
00:38:49,311 --> 00:38:51,730
- What?
- Please. You know that
revolving restaurant thing?

534
00:38:51,855 --> 00:38:53,732
- Yeah.
- Meet me there in half an hour.
- Half an hour?

535
00:38:53,856 --> 00:38:56,109
- Yeah. Please!
- Roger, come on!

536
00:38:56,234 --> 00:38:58,111
I'll try.

537
00:39:14,585 --> 00:39:18,297
- Thanks, Roger.
- Yeah, well... What's up, Irv?

538
00:39:18,423 --> 00:39:20,299
- How about a drink?
- No, I'm fine.

539
00:39:20,425 --> 00:39:22,844
- What's so important
that it couldn't wait?
- Want something to eat?

540
00:39:22,969 --> 00:39:25,763
- No, I'm fine!
- A salad or something?
- Irv!

541
00:39:28,141 --> 00:39:32,979
- I need a sled.
- You came all the way
to Calgary without a sled?

542
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:36,481
I got 4,800 dollars.
I just need something competitive.

543
00:39:36,606 --> 00:39:39,693
- For five grand?
- I know you got something
lying around, Roger.

544
00:39:39,818 --> 00:39:41,695
- But, Irv...
- Anything.

545
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:45,282
- You know I can't do that.
- Now, wait a minute, Roger.

546
00:39:45,407 --> 00:39:49,578
Remember when you were desperate
to make that last slot on the
'68 Grenoble team...

547
00:39:49,703 --> 00:39:51,705
and you pleaded with me
to talk to Kurt?

548
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:54,124
Did I say, "Sorry, Roger,
I can't do it"?

549
00:39:54,249 --> 00:39:57,210
Come on, don't make me beg.

550
00:39:57,335 --> 00:40:00,213
Roger, it's me.

551
00:40:00,338 --> 00:40:03,508
All right, maybe I can get you
one of our practice sleds.

552
00:40:03,633 --> 00:40:06,511
You're a saint, you know that?
A saint! You haven't changed
a bit! You're still a saint!

553
00:40:06,636 --> 00:40:09,848
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, look, don't get
all mushy on me. Just tell me one thing.

554
00:40:09,973 --> 00:40:14,686
Is this whole thing a big joke,
or do you really expect these
Jamaicans to qualify?

555
00:40:14,811 --> 00:40:18,898
Not only are they going to
qualify, they're going to
turn some heads doing it.

556
00:40:19,023 --> 00:40:24,195
Listen, three of these guys
can run the hundred in under ten-flat.

557
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,739
I don't care who you are,
that's lightning.

558
00:40:26,864 --> 00:40:30,034
Yeah, but can lightning
run on ice?

559
00:40:49,053 --> 00:40:50,930
No problem, man.

560
00:40:55,017 --> 00:40:56,894
God!

561
00:41:04,859 --> 00:41:08,571
Irv, these special shoes
aren't very effective.

562
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:22,085
Grip with your toes!

563
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:24,837
All right, you sugar-coated
track stars!

564
00:41:24,963 --> 00:41:28,591
Move out and let the ice rasta
show you how it's done.

565
00:41:30,677 --> 00:41:34,430
- Yeah. Like that, yeah. Good.
- Hey, fellas!

566
00:41:34,555 --> 00:41:37,266
- Look at my progress.
- Stop touching me!

567
00:41:45,774 --> 00:41:50,445
All right, fellas, that's it!
Let's get off the ice before practice.

568
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:53,573
- What practice?
- That practice.

569
00:42:09,089 --> 00:42:10,966
That's right.

570
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,596
Good team this year.

571
00:42:54,633 --> 00:42:59,388
Ein, zwei, drei!

572
00:44:16,797 --> 00:44:19,800
Oh, man, you should see this
on the hill.

573
00:44:19,925 --> 00:44:22,427
- It's like a miracle.
- What's "Schweiz"?

574
00:44:22,552 --> 00:44:26,306
- No, man! Swiss!
- This is the real thing, man.

575
00:44:26,431 --> 00:44:28,599
Gentlemen...

576
00:44:28,724 --> 00:44:31,852
I'd like to introduce you to
the newest member of our team.

577
00:44:36,816 --> 00:44:42,280
Um, you won't believe what I
had to go through to get us
a sled in such good shape.

578
00:44:42,405 --> 00:44:44,198
Uh...

579
00:44:45,574 --> 00:44:48,202
If we're going to make it
into the Olympics...

580
00:44:48,327 --> 00:44:51,539
this is the boat that's
going to take us there.

581
00:44:51,664 --> 00:44:54,125
Well, I'm... I'm told
she's actually quite fast.

582
00:44:57,128 --> 00:44:59,839
I, uh, know she's not
much to look at...

583
00:44:59,964 --> 00:45:03,467
- but, uh...
- Shh! She's beautiful!

584
00:45:15,854 --> 00:45:19,899
All coaches must sign teams in
before approaching bob run.

585
00:45:41,129 --> 00:45:43,006
Here we go.

586
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:47,177
Let's go! Let's go!

587
00:45:49,179 --> 00:45:51,054
- Hold on a minute.
- All right, come on.

588
00:45:53,265 --> 00:45:55,142
Here we go.

589
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:15,871
Ah. This is good.

590
00:46:19,166 --> 00:46:21,335
Okay, this is it.

591
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:24,713
- Everybody climb in.
- Hold up. I don't understand.

592
00:46:24,838 --> 00:46:27,925
- We're not going to push start?
- No, we're going to push start
next time.

593
00:46:28,050 --> 00:46:30,385
For your first run, I'm just going
to nudge you off, okay? Everybody in.

594
00:46:30,511 --> 00:46:32,386
Let's go, let's go.
Come on. Come on.

595
00:46:36,474 --> 00:46:38,726
- Don't touch me!
- Hey, Baldy, get off my foot!

596
00:46:38,851 --> 00:46:40,728
- Don't touch me!
- Here you go. Come on.

597
00:46:40,853 --> 00:46:45,233
Hey, Blitzer, why don't you put
some training wheels on that sled?

598
00:46:46,484 --> 00:46:48,861
That's funny. Very funny.

599
00:46:48,986 --> 00:46:51,239
You want to kiss my egg?

600
00:46:51,364 --> 00:46:54,075
I'm not kissing no egg.

601
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,077
- Suit yourself.
- Now, listen up, fellas.

602
00:46:56,202 --> 00:47:00,081
- I don't want you to worry
about looking good out there.
- Ah, Blitzie.

603
00:47:00,206 --> 00:47:03,209
You going to tuck them in too?

604
00:47:03,334 --> 00:47:06,295
Hey... Seeming to you
like nobody likes us?

605
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:10,550
We're different. People are always
afraid of what's different.

606
00:47:10,675 --> 00:47:12,927
Hey, Jamaica.

607
00:47:13,052 --> 00:47:16,554
Watch out for number 12 turn.
It's scary, huh?

608
00:47:18,473 --> 00:47:21,142
- What's his problem?
- He's Josef Grool.

609
00:47:21,268 --> 00:47:23,103
He's one of the best drivers
in the world.

610
00:47:23,228 --> 00:47:25,605
Yeah, he's one of the biggest
assholes in the world too.

611
00:47:25,730 --> 00:47:27,899
Well, don't listen to him.
You listen to me.

612
00:47:28,024 --> 00:47:30,110
Derice, right here.
You got it?

613
00:47:30,235 --> 00:47:34,781
Remember, keep your hands soft
and your mind clear.

614
00:47:34,906 --> 00:47:38,451
- High in, low out. What is it?
- High in, low out.

615
00:47:38,576 --> 00:47:41,496
All right, put your helmets on,
everybody! Let's go!

616
00:47:41,621 --> 00:47:44,624
Here we go! Come on!
Helmets on!

617
00:47:46,543 --> 00:47:48,086
- Hey, Coach.
- Yeah?

618
00:47:48,211 --> 00:47:51,339
I can't get my helmet on!
Oh, thanks, Coach.

619
00:47:51,464 --> 00:47:54,134
- That's what I'm here for.
- Oh. Coach?

620
00:47:54,259 --> 00:47:56,927
- Yeah.
- I got to go, you know.

621
00:47:57,052 --> 00:48:00,472
- Hold it.
- Hold it?
- Hold it.
- Hold it?

622
00:48:00,597 --> 00:48:05,352
- Yeah, hold it!
- B-But, Coach, I can't hold it!
We're not bobsledding yet.

623
00:48:05,477 --> 00:48:09,106
- Oh, yes, we are.
- Coach! Coach!

624
00:48:11,567 --> 00:48:13,444
Coach!

625
00:48:15,154 --> 00:48:16,655
Coach! Coach!

626
00:48:20,409 --> 00:48:22,286
Bob in track.

627
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:28,500
Coach!

628
00:48:35,799 --> 00:48:39,135
Slow down! Oh! Slow it down!
Slow down! Slow it down!

629
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:42,513
Oh, my god! Oh!
Oh, Derice! Oh, Derice!

630
00:48:42,638 --> 00:48:46,809
I hate you!
I hate you! I hate you!

631
00:48:46,934 --> 00:48:48,227
Whoa!

632
00:48:59,989 --> 00:49:01,908
Sanka, you dead?

633
00:49:03,284 --> 00:49:05,745
Yeah, man.

634
00:49:05,870 --> 00:49:08,164
Well, you can pee now.

635
00:49:10,082 --> 00:49:12,210
Ohh. Too late.

636
00:49:14,962 --> 00:49:16,839
This is embarrassing.

637
00:49:21,718 --> 00:49:25,472
Man, shut down that
hot plate, fool.

638
00:49:25,597 --> 00:49:27,849
Those bananas are stinking
like a dead dog.

639
00:49:27,974 --> 00:49:32,062
Back off! Back off, you eight-ball!
This is my mama's secret recipe.

640
00:49:32,187 --> 00:49:35,899
And I hope you don't mind keeping quiet
while I catch up on my reading.

641
00:49:36,024 --> 00:49:39,611
What are you talking about, reading?
This is a children's book.

642
00:49:39,736 --> 00:49:42,072
- Oh, is that so?
- Yes, that's so.

643
00:49:42,197 --> 00:49:45,575
Well, if it's a children's book,
that means it's too advanced
for the likes of you.

644
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:49,579
What are you trying to say, that I'm
not smarter than a little child?

645
00:49:49,704 --> 00:49:51,873
No, what I am saying to you...

646
00:49:51,998 --> 00:49:56,628
is that you are the kind of
club-totin', raw meat-eatin',
me-Tarzan-you-Jane-in'...

647
00:49:56,753 --> 00:50:01,632
big, bald bubblehead that
can only count to ten if he's
barefoot or wearing sandals.

648
00:50:01,757 --> 00:50:04,718
Say whatever it is
that you want...

649
00:50:04,843 --> 00:50:08,013
'cause you're just like every
other fool on the island.

650
00:50:10,015 --> 00:50:14,603
You're going nowhere, Sanka,
and you're thrilled to death about it.

651
00:50:16,063 --> 00:50:19,733
But you see me?
You see me?

652
00:50:19,858 --> 00:50:23,445
I'm different,
'cause I know exactly...

653
00:50:23,571 --> 00:50:25,656
where I'm going...

654
00:50:25,781 --> 00:50:31,412
and after I, Yul Brenner, win
the Olympics and become famous...

655
00:50:31,537 --> 00:50:33,414
I'm going to leave the island...

656
00:50:34,748 --> 00:50:37,626
and live right down there.

657
00:50:42,714 --> 00:50:45,091
What are you laughing about?

658
00:50:45,216 --> 00:50:47,677
- What are you laughing about?
- That's Buckingham Palace.

659
00:50:49,929 --> 00:50:53,266
You plan on living there, you're
going to have to marry the Queen.

660
00:50:53,391 --> 00:50:56,477
Yul, that's where
the Queen of England lives.

661
00:51:01,441 --> 00:51:05,528
Face it, Yul Brenner... You can
start calling yourself Madonna...

662
00:51:05,653 --> 00:51:10,450
but you're still going to end up
in an outhouse shanty like every
other dock-working nobody.

663
00:51:10,575 --> 00:51:13,995
- Mm, says who?
- Says me, rich boy.
What do you know about it?

664
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:17,206
Well, I know my father
started off in a one-room hut.

665
00:51:17,332 --> 00:51:22,003
- Now he lives in one of the
biggest homes in Kingston.
- Well, he ain't your father.

666
00:51:22,128 --> 00:51:24,629
He doesn't have to be.

667
00:51:24,755 --> 00:51:28,008
All he has to do is know what
he wants and work hard for it.

668
00:51:28,133 --> 00:51:31,386
And if he wants it bad enough,
he'll get it.

669
00:51:32,637 --> 00:51:36,349
Look, believe me, Sanka...

670
00:51:36,475 --> 00:51:39,311
the more Yul Brenners we got
making it in this world...

671
00:51:39,436 --> 00:51:44,357
the better off this world will
be, especially for Jamaicans.

672
00:52:00,499 --> 00:52:02,959
Go ahead, Yul Brenner.

673
00:52:03,085 --> 00:52:04,960
Go get your palace.

674
00:52:18,182 --> 00:52:20,059
Move! Move!

675
00:52:21,435 --> 00:52:23,312
Bob in track.

676
00:52:27,608 --> 00:52:30,402
What do you have in there,
a baby?

677
00:52:34,073 --> 00:52:36,992
- I can't believe you're still cold, man.
- Cold?

678
00:52:37,117 --> 00:52:40,412
I'm freezing my royal
Rastafarian nay-nays off!

679
00:52:40,538 --> 00:52:42,748
All right, we're up!
Let's go, guys, this is it!

680
00:52:42,873 --> 00:52:44,750
Give me that!

681
00:52:44,875 --> 00:52:50,088
Okay, now, this is our first real push
start. But don't worry about it, okay?

682
00:52:50,213 --> 00:52:52,841
I-It's no different
than what we've practiced.
We've done it a hundred times.

683
00:52:52,966 --> 00:52:54,551
Derice.
Right here.

684
00:52:54,676 --> 00:52:56,761
- Okay, get your helmets on.
- Coach!

685
00:52:56,886 --> 00:52:58,429
- Okay, okay.
- Thanks, Coach.

686
00:52:58,555 --> 00:53:00,723
All right, let's go, Derice.
It's yours.

687
00:53:00,849 --> 00:53:03,893
- Ridiculous. What's he doing?
- Ready?

688
00:53:04,018 --> 00:53:05,937
One...

689
00:53:06,062 --> 00:53:07,564
two...

690
00:53:07,689 --> 00:53:09,649
three!

691
00:53:09,774 --> 00:53:12,944
- Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
- Hold on! Wait! Hold on!

692
00:53:13,069 --> 00:53:16,281
Now! Now! Now!

693
00:53:16,406 --> 00:53:18,283
Now!

694
00:53:51,023 --> 00:53:54,818
- Those guys are
pretty good, aren't they?
- Good? They're the best.

695
00:53:56,486 --> 00:53:58,655
So you guys been having a
little trouble out there, huh?

696
00:53:58,780 --> 00:54:01,450
- Ah, we'll be fine.
- I sure hope so.

697
00:54:01,575 --> 00:54:04,619
That'd be a real shame
to waste all that talent.

698
00:54:04,745 --> 00:54:07,622
I'm not worried.
And we have a good coach.

699
00:54:10,124 --> 00:54:13,502
Kid, I hate to say it,
but, uh, you got to wake up.

700
00:54:13,627 --> 00:54:19,008
Coach Blitzer is what's killing
you; he's been useless since
the day he was busted.

701
00:54:19,133 --> 00:54:22,678
- What you mean, "busted"?
- The '72 Games.

702
00:54:22,803 --> 00:54:26,349
The guy hid weights in the front
of the sled to make it go faster.

703
00:54:27,975 --> 00:54:31,395
So what? It's no big deal.

704
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:35,858
Having your gold medals taken away
for cheating is a big deal.

705
00:54:37,610 --> 00:54:40,112
Derice! Let's go.
We got a meeting.

706
00:54:52,290 --> 00:54:54,542
Giving my kid
a few pointers, Larry?

707
00:54:56,711 --> 00:54:59,380
"Your kid" is going to need
all the help he can get...

708
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:06,137
Coach.

709
00:55:12,477 --> 00:55:15,188
Maid service, sir. Would you
like your bed turned down?

710
00:55:15,313 --> 00:55:18,525
Mint? Perhaps I could
dust your head.

711
00:55:18,650 --> 00:55:21,611
Whatever's wrong with you
is no little thing.

712
00:55:24,072 --> 00:55:27,909
Hurry up, man. I have a dead
grandmother that moves faster than you.

713
00:55:28,034 --> 00:55:29,911
Wait, wait.

714
00:55:31,121 --> 00:55:32,996
What that fool want now?

715
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:36,875
What?

716
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,877
Sorry.

717
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:47,219
- What do you have there, man?
- A telegram.

718
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:50,222
I know it's a telegram.
What does it say?

719
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:56,603
It's from my father.

720
00:55:56,728 --> 00:55:59,606
He says I have to come home
right now.

721
00:56:10,409 --> 00:56:12,619
Workin'

722
00:56:12,744 --> 00:56:15,538
Workin' for my payday

723
00:56:16,747 --> 00:56:18,666
Every time payday comes

724
00:56:18,791 --> 00:56:21,127
You know I'm down
to my last

725
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:25,590
Well, I'm dreamin'

726
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:28,134
Dreamin' of you all day

727
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:34,890
When the work day's done
we're gonna love that night away

728
00:56:36,350 --> 00:56:39,979
'Cause we're goin' nowhere
and we're gettin' there fast

729
00:56:40,104 --> 00:56:42,648
When we finally make it
we can both look back

730
00:56:42,773 --> 00:56:45,735
On these hard times

731
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:48,195
- Just for a laugh
- Hi!

732
00:56:48,321 --> 00:56:52,825
- Howdy, partner.
- 'Cause when you got love
you don't need too much money

733
00:56:52,950 --> 00:56:55,620
I'm in love with you
and don't you know, honey

734
00:56:55,827 --> 00:56:58,538
We're goin' nowhere

735
00:56:58,663 --> 00:57:03,501
- And we're gettin' there fast
- You've worked too hard and too long!

736
00:57:03,627 --> 00:57:06,630
And let me tell you
something else, Junior Bevil.

737
00:57:06,755 --> 00:57:10,508
If it wasn't for you,
we wouldn't be here right now.

738
00:57:10,634 --> 00:57:13,928
Oh, wait.
But you don't understand.

739
00:57:14,054 --> 00:57:16,181
He is really mad.

740
00:57:16,306 --> 00:57:19,017
I mean, you don't know him
like I do, you know.

741
00:57:19,142 --> 00:57:21,895
I think I'd better just
do what he wants...

742
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:23,897
and go back home.

743
00:57:24,022 --> 00:57:26,441
And forget about your teammates.

744
00:57:26,566 --> 00:57:28,610
Blood fire!

745
00:57:28,735 --> 00:57:32,697
The man, you act like he's
the king of the whole world.

746
00:57:32,822 --> 00:57:35,658
But what should I do?
What should I do?

747
00:57:35,784 --> 00:57:41,205
Hey, Jamaica, keep it down!
You are not owning this place.

748
00:57:41,330 --> 00:57:44,792
Sorry, sir, sorry. I didn't...
I didn't mean to bother anyone.

749
00:57:46,168 --> 00:57:48,921
You have no business here,
Jamaica.

750
00:57:49,046 --> 00:57:52,841
You and your stupid friend
playing like you are bobsledders, ja.

751
00:57:52,966 --> 00:57:56,095
Why don't you tourists go back
to where it is you came from...

752
00:57:56,220 --> 00:57:59,723
and leave the bobsledding
to the real men.

753
00:57:59,848 --> 00:58:01,850
Well, I'm, uh...
I'm a real man.

754
00:58:01,975 --> 00:58:04,770
You want to say something,
Jamaica? Come on, out with it.

755
00:58:04,895 --> 00:58:07,189
You know that money can't buy

756
00:58:08,982 --> 00:58:10,734
This feeling

757
00:58:10,859 --> 00:58:15,197
That we're sharing tonight

758
00:58:15,322 --> 00:58:19,700
'Cause we're goin' nowhere
and we're gettin' there fast

759
00:58:19,826 --> 00:58:22,370
Come on, man.
Come on! Right now!

760
00:58:27,542 --> 00:58:30,128
Now, look in the mirror
and tell me what you see.

761
00:58:31,337 --> 00:58:33,756
- I see Junior.
- You see Junior.

762
00:58:33,881 --> 00:58:39,428
Well, you want to know what I
see? I see pride. I see power!

763
00:58:39,554 --> 00:58:43,975
I see a badass mother who don't
take no crap off nobody!

764
00:58:45,393 --> 00:58:48,062
- You really see all that?
- Yeah, man.

765
00:58:48,187 --> 00:58:52,608
But it's not about what I see.
It's about what you see.

766
00:58:52,733 --> 00:58:56,696
Now, look in this mirror and
tell me again what you see.

767
00:58:56,821 --> 00:58:58,698
I see...

768
00:59:01,158 --> 00:59:04,619
- Pride!
- Pride! Right.

769
00:59:04,744 --> 00:59:07,122
- Power!
- Power.

770
00:59:07,247 --> 00:59:09,249
- And I see...
- A badass mother...

771
00:59:09,374 --> 00:59:11,585
- Who don't take no crap...
- Off of nobody!

772
00:59:11,710 --> 00:59:13,253
- Again!
- I see pride!

773
00:59:13,378 --> 00:59:15,255
- Can't hear you!
- I see power!

774
00:59:15,380 --> 00:59:18,925
I see a badass mother
who won't take no crap off of nobody!

775
00:59:19,050 --> 00:59:20,635
- Once again!
- I see pride!

776
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:22,387
- Junior!
- I see power!

777
00:59:22,512 --> 00:59:25,974
I see a badass mother
who won't take no crap off of nobody!

778
00:59:26,099 --> 00:59:28,810
- That's right!
- That's right! Junior Bevil!

779
00:59:28,935 --> 00:59:30,979
Where ya... W...
Where he going?

780
00:59:42,990 --> 00:59:45,326
Pride. Power. Pride.

781
00:59:46,869 --> 00:59:48,829
Now, you listen to me, buddy.

782
00:59:48,954 --> 00:59:53,042
I will not be talked to that
way, so you'd better come up
with a damn good apology...

783
00:59:53,167 --> 00:59:56,211
- or else.
- Or else what?

784
00:59:56,337 --> 00:59:58,130
Ow.

785
00:59:58,255 --> 01:00:00,049
Eh, Jamaica?

786
01:00:00,174 --> 01:00:02,051
Or else what?

787
01:00:05,971 --> 01:00:07,848
Come on, Jamaica.

788
01:00:07,973 --> 01:00:09,224
Say something.

789
01:00:14,938 --> 01:00:16,815
No problem, man.

790
01:00:37,085 --> 01:00:39,003
Excuse me, missy!

791
01:00:45,676 --> 01:00:47,553
That hurt! Get off!

792
01:00:50,181 --> 01:00:52,558
I can't believe this.

793
01:00:52,683 --> 01:00:54,852
I just can't believe this.

794
01:00:54,977 --> 01:00:58,439
Didn't one of you have the sense
to know better? Go on. Laugh.

795
01:00:58,564 --> 01:01:00,441
I wanna see who's laughin'
when Irv gets here.

796
01:01:00,566 --> 01:01:02,443
Now wait, wait.

797
01:01:02,568 --> 01:01:06,279
When that East German fellow
go out and push my teammate...

798
01:01:06,405 --> 01:01:09,491
then blood fire,
we have to fight back.

799
01:01:09,616 --> 01:01:12,035
You don't see the Swiss
team fightin', do you?

800
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:15,872
You don't see the Swiss team
drinkin' and carryin' on and such.

801
01:01:15,997 --> 01:01:18,625
And you don't see the Swiss
team smilin' neither.

802
01:01:18,750 --> 01:01:22,796
In fact, if one of those Swiss boys
ever come across a pretty girl...

803
01:01:22,921 --> 01:01:25,841
he probably yell,
"Eins, zwei, drei..."

804
01:01:25,966 --> 01:01:27,843
and try to push her
down some ice.

805
01:01:31,304 --> 01:01:34,099
- What happened?
- Oh, I took care of the whole thing.

806
01:01:34,224 --> 01:01:36,184
I told the owner of the bar
these guys were...

807
01:01:36,309 --> 01:01:38,812
mentally disturbed, so he's
not gonna press any charges.

808
01:01:38,937 --> 01:01:41,106
All right, sled god
does it again.

809
01:01:41,231 --> 01:01:43,733
Just shut up, Sanka.

810
01:01:43,859 --> 01:01:45,861
Now maybe you
haven't noticed...

811
01:01:45,986 --> 01:01:49,738
but we aren't exactly winning
any popularity contests here.

812
01:01:49,864 --> 01:01:54,618
They hate me, they hate you,
they hate us.

813
01:01:54,743 --> 01:01:57,204
Now, if we're even gonna
think about qualifying...

814
01:01:57,329 --> 01:02:01,542
we're each gonna have to sit down
and take a nice, deep look inside.

815
01:02:01,667 --> 01:02:04,211
I didn't come all this way
to get my butt whipped.

816
01:02:04,336 --> 01:02:09,008
As a matter of fact, now that
I'm here, I thought I'd do
a little whippin' of my own.

817
01:02:09,133 --> 01:02:11,010
Good night, gentlemen.

818
01:02:33,323 --> 01:02:35,533
Rise and shine!

819
01:02:35,658 --> 01:02:37,535
It's butt-whipping time.

820
01:02:50,882 --> 01:02:52,759
Rise above it

821
01:02:56,179 --> 01:02:58,264
Rise above it

822
01:02:58,389 --> 01:03:01,809
Not bad.
Pick it up though.

823
01:03:01,935 --> 01:03:04,062
Come on, come on, come on,
come on. Now, now, now!

824
01:03:04,187 --> 01:03:09,317
Just rise above it
Come on and rise above it

825
01:03:09,442 --> 01:03:13,278
- Good. That's it.
- Even though the road
seems very long and narrow

826
01:03:13,403 --> 01:03:16,406
- Five more. Come on. Five more.
Push it, push it. Come on.
- Baby need to sharpen his pin

827
01:03:16,531 --> 01:03:19,951
- Just like an arrow
- That's it, that's it.

828
01:03:20,077 --> 01:03:22,245
- Got-a no place to go
- That's it. Good, good.

829
01:03:22,371 --> 01:03:24,831
- Good. You're doin' fine.
You got anymore?
- Believe us, baby

830
01:03:24,956 --> 01:03:27,793
Come on! Come on! Get in!

831
01:03:27,918 --> 01:03:30,462
Oh! Wait! Hey! Help!

832
01:03:32,673 --> 01:03:36,760
You gotta learn to
believe in yourself, yeah

833
01:03:36,885 --> 01:03:40,972
Listen, little man, there ain't
nothin' you can't achieve if
you work hard and sacrifice

834
01:03:41,098 --> 01:03:43,433
- Hear me now
- If you've got a problem

835
01:03:43,558 --> 01:03:46,478
- You've got to rise above it
Yes, you do
- Go, go, go, go, go! That's it.

836
01:03:46,603 --> 01:03:49,189
- And when you face a challenge
- You gotta grip with your toes. Go! Go!

837
01:03:49,314 --> 01:03:52,149
- You got to rise above it It's so large
- Now! Now!

838
01:03:52,274 --> 01:03:54,944
If those storm clouds
reappear, oh, yes

839
01:03:55,069 --> 01:03:58,698
You don't ever have to fear
Just rise above it

840
01:03:58,823 --> 01:04:01,409
- You have got to
- Rise above it

841
01:04:02,827 --> 01:04:06,622
I tell ya once
and I tell ya twice

842
01:04:06,747 --> 01:04:08,624
You know, you're gonna have to
do this on your own one day.

843
01:04:08,749 --> 01:04:10,835
Just one man
and a thousand eyes

844
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:13,504
Come now, come now
and take my advice

845
01:04:13,629 --> 01:04:16,090
Rise above it

846
01:04:16,215 --> 01:04:18,843
Rise above it

847
01:04:18,968 --> 01:04:20,845
- Rise above it
- Go, go, go, go, go!

848
01:04:20,970 --> 01:04:23,264
Now, now, now, now, now!

849
01:04:23,389 --> 01:04:25,850
- Straight. Right.
- Turn six. Turn seven.

850
01:04:25,975 --> 01:04:27,852
- Straight. Right.
- Turn eight.

851
01:04:27,977 --> 01:04:30,521
- Follow me, follow me
follow me, follow me
- Rise above it

852
01:04:30,646 --> 01:04:33,440
- That's it! That's it! That's it!
- Rise above it

853
01:04:40,238 --> 01:04:42,866
- Rise above it
- You can do it

854
01:04:42,991 --> 01:04:45,535
- Rise above it
- You can do it

855
01:04:48,830 --> 01:04:51,499
Okay, guys.

856
01:04:51,624 --> 01:04:54,878
Tonight's the night.

857
01:04:55,003 --> 01:04:57,130
Now in a few minutes, you're gonna
get a chance to do something...

858
01:04:57,255 --> 01:05:00,717
that no one in your country
has ever done.

859
01:05:00,842 --> 01:05:03,052
I was gonna save this for
the Olympics, but I figure...

860
01:05:03,178 --> 01:05:05,555
if we're going to convince
these judges...

861
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:09,100
that we are
world-class sledders...

862
01:05:09,225 --> 01:05:12,061
then we had better look
like world-class sledders.

863
01:05:14,189 --> 01:05:16,231
- Whoa, man.
- Yes.

864
01:05:17,399 --> 01:05:19,276
Nice.

865
01:05:24,198 --> 01:05:26,200
I freeze in this.

866
01:05:32,331 --> 01:05:34,208
Bob in track.

867
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:44,259
Hello, gentlemen.

868
01:05:44,384 --> 01:05:48,388
Irv, this is Karl Shindler.
He'll be watching the middle track.

869
01:05:48,513 --> 01:05:50,849
- How do you do?
- And this is August Gremmer.

870
01:05:50,974 --> 01:05:53,018
He'll be judging
the push starts.

871
01:05:53,143 --> 01:05:56,271
- Hi.
- I'm your third official
up in the tower.

872
01:05:57,396 --> 01:06:00,191
You. What happened
to Kroychzech?

873
01:06:00,316 --> 01:06:03,235
He came down sick this morning.
I'm taking his place.

874
01:06:04,362 --> 01:06:06,280
Oh, goody.

875
01:06:06,405 --> 01:06:09,325
Oh, the Alliance has decided
to change the qualifying time...

876
01:06:09,450 --> 01:06:12,078
from a minute-two
to a minute-flat.

877
01:06:12,203 --> 01:06:14,080
Is that clear?

878
01:06:16,707 --> 01:06:19,126
No problem, man.

879
01:06:25,049 --> 01:06:27,677
Go get 'em, kid.

880
01:06:32,598 --> 01:06:34,600
Track is clear
for Jamaica One.

881
01:06:45,276 --> 01:06:49,280
Eins, zwei, drei.

882
01:06:53,910 --> 01:06:55,829
Go, go, go!
Now, now, now, now!

883
01:07:00,291 --> 01:07:03,503
- All right, what was that time?
- 6.13.

884
01:07:45,878 --> 01:07:48,714
Under 60?
Is it under 60?

885
01:08:02,727 --> 01:08:04,604
59-point-si..!

886
01:08:07,273 --> 01:08:11,319
I'm, uh... I'm sorry.
I'm outta here. That's terrific.

887
01:08:15,281 --> 01:08:17,533
Derice!

888
01:08:18,993 --> 01:08:21,078
- Ah, no, it's great.
- They couldn't beat us.

889
01:08:21,204 --> 01:08:24,081
- I know we were the best.
- Yeah.

890
01:08:24,207 --> 01:08:27,585
...inspired you guys, that's all.
- You were great, all of ya.

891
01:08:27,710 --> 01:08:32,173
Nobody had that much fun
in a sled since Santy Claus.

892
01:08:32,298 --> 01:08:34,550
Fellas, here's to
followin' your dreams.

893
01:08:34,675 --> 01:08:36,761
- Yeah, man.
- Followin' your dreams.

894
01:08:36,886 --> 01:08:39,722
I said it to your father the first time
I met him, and I'll say it again.

895
01:08:39,847 --> 01:08:42,016
Sprinters make
the best bobsledders.

896
01:08:42,141 --> 01:08:44,768
Here's to sprinting.

897
01:08:44,893 --> 01:08:47,604
So what are we gonna
name the sled?

898
01:08:47,729 --> 01:08:50,440
How about "Tallulah"?

899
01:08:51,858 --> 01:08:55,445
- That's hot. Tallulah.
- Tallulah. Tallulah.

900
01:08:55,570 --> 01:08:59,115
Sounds like a two-dollar hooker.
How you come up with that?

901
01:08:59,241 --> 01:09:01,868
Hey, you idiot,
that's my mother's name.

902
01:09:04,162 --> 01:09:06,539
- It's a pretty name.
- Tallulah. I like that.

903
01:09:06,665 --> 01:09:08,708
So what's it gonna be, star?

904
01:09:08,833 --> 01:09:12,337
What are the people gonna be screamin'
when Jamaica takes the hill?

905
01:09:12,462 --> 01:09:15,799
I say we call it
"Cool Runnings."

906
01:09:15,924 --> 01:09:17,884
- Beautiful.
- I like it.

907
01:09:18,009 --> 01:09:20,261
- It's very strong.
- Nice. Very nice.

908
01:09:20,387 --> 01:09:23,181
Uh, what exactly
does it mean?

909
01:09:23,306 --> 01:09:26,558
"Cool runnings" means
"Peace be the journey."

910
01:09:26,684 --> 01:09:28,644
- Peace be the journey.
- Peace be the journey.

911
01:09:28,769 --> 01:09:30,938
- Cool runnings.
- Cool runnings.

912
01:09:31,063 --> 01:09:33,482
- Cool runnings.
- E-Excuse me.

913
01:09:33,607 --> 01:09:35,859
To the man
in the orange suit!

914
01:09:35,985 --> 01:09:39,321
To the orange!
To the man in the orange!

915
01:09:39,446 --> 01:09:42,783
- To the messenger.
- To the messenger.
- To the messenger.

916
01:09:48,789 --> 01:09:52,292
We are officially
disqualified.

917
01:10:03,262 --> 01:10:06,806
Excuse me, gentlemen. Kurt,
I really have to talk to you.

918
01:10:06,931 --> 01:10:10,184
Excuse me, Irv. I've
nothing to say to you.

919
01:10:10,309 --> 01:10:12,186
Yes, you do.

920
01:10:12,311 --> 01:10:14,981
- I want to know why
you disqualified my guys.
- As you were told...

921
01:10:15,106 --> 01:10:18,943
your team must compete in
an international race in order
to qualify for the Olympics.

922
01:10:19,068 --> 01:10:20,945
But in an Olympic year...

923
01:10:21,070 --> 01:10:23,406
the qualifiers count
as an international race.

924
01:10:23,531 --> 01:10:26,033
That may have been true
in past Olympic years...

925
01:10:26,159 --> 01:10:29,495
but this year, the Alliance
decided to change its policy.

926
01:10:29,620 --> 01:10:32,540
Oh, please!
Change its policy?

927
01:10:32,665 --> 01:10:36,753
The Alliance has the right to do
whatever they feel is in the
best interest of the sport.

928
01:10:36,878 --> 01:10:41,591
We must also be concerned about
the potential for embarrassment.

929
01:10:41,716 --> 01:10:43,885
Oh, forgive me.
I didn't realize...

930
01:10:44,010 --> 01:10:47,096
that four black guys in
a bobsled could make you blush.

931
01:10:47,221 --> 01:10:49,806
I think we've heard enough.

932
01:10:49,931 --> 01:10:53,560
Come on, Kurt. What you're doin'
is wrong and you know it.

933
01:10:53,685 --> 01:10:55,562
Now, if this is about
you and me...

934
01:10:55,687 --> 01:10:58,648
then let's get it straight
right now.

935
01:10:58,773 --> 01:11:02,652
All right, 16 years ago, I made
the biggest mistake of my life.

936
01:11:02,777 --> 01:11:06,072
I cheated.
I was stupid.

937
01:11:06,198 --> 01:11:09,951
I embarrassed myself,
my family...

938
01:11:10,076 --> 01:11:13,330
my teammates,
my country and my coach.

939
01:11:15,499 --> 01:11:18,543
If it's revenge you want,
take it.

940
01:11:18,668 --> 01:11:21,713
Go ahead.
Disqualify me. Banish me.

941
01:11:21,838 --> 01:11:23,757
Do whatever you want,
but do it to me.

942
01:11:23,882 --> 01:11:28,345
It was me who let you down,
Kurt. It wasn't my guys.

943
01:11:28,470 --> 01:11:30,513
They've done everything you've
asked of them, and they did it...

944
01:11:30,638 --> 01:11:34,725
with all of you
laughing in their face.

945
01:11:34,850 --> 01:11:38,187
Hell, it doesn't matter
if they come in first or 50th.

946
01:11:38,312 --> 01:11:41,607
Those guys have earned the right
to represent their country.

947
01:11:41,732 --> 01:11:43,609
They've earned the right...

948
01:11:43,734 --> 01:11:47,446
to march into that stadium
and wave their nation's flag.

949
01:11:47,571 --> 01:11:49,615
That's the single
greatest honor...

950
01:11:49,740 --> 01:11:51,617
an athlete
could ever have.

951
01:11:53,911 --> 01:11:56,455
That's what the Olympics
are about.

952
01:11:58,499 --> 01:12:00,709
Sixteen years ago,
I forgot that.

953
01:12:02,294 --> 01:12:04,171
Don't you go
and do the same.

954
01:12:08,175 --> 01:12:10,177
Sorry if I interrupted
your meeting.

955
01:12:24,190 --> 01:12:26,818
Hello. Yes?

956
01:12:30,405 --> 01:12:32,282
Yeah.

957
01:12:34,117 --> 01:12:35,994
Right. Goodbye.

958
01:12:39,914 --> 01:12:43,418
- What?
- That was the Alliance.

959
01:12:43,543 --> 01:12:45,920
- God.
- What did they say?

960
01:12:47,380 --> 01:12:49,298
Oh, they said
we're back in.

961
01:12:52,801 --> 01:12:54,845
Yes! Yes! Yes!

962
01:13:06,148 --> 01:13:08,775
And a lot is expected
of the Italian team.

963
01:13:08,900 --> 01:13:11,194
Did I miss it?
Did I miss it?

964
01:13:11,319 --> 01:13:14,281
No, child.
You didn't miss a thing.

965
01:13:14,406 --> 01:13:17,117
...of Jamaica made it
all the way here to Calgary...

966
01:13:17,242 --> 01:13:19,244
to compete
in the bobsled event.

967
01:13:19,369 --> 01:13:22,372
Their flag bearer is
the sled captain Derice Bannock.

968
01:13:22,497 --> 01:13:25,709
Derice's father, Ben Bannock, was
a gold medalist in the 200 meters...

969
01:13:25,834 --> 01:13:28,545
at the Summer Olympic games
over 20 years ago.

970
01:13:28,670 --> 01:13:32,215
And perhaps there's gold in
two generations of this family.

971
01:13:32,340 --> 01:13:35,217
That's quite a story.
The Jamaican bobsled team.

972
01:13:35,342 --> 01:13:39,054
It's a beautiful afternoon in Calgary,
and there is a lot more coming up.

973
01:13:39,180 --> 01:13:41,265
So stay tuned for
more exciting coverage...

974
01:13:41,390 --> 01:13:44,810
of the opening ceremonies
of the 15th Winter Olympiad...

975
01:13:44,935 --> 01:13:47,396
from Calgary,
Alberta, Canada.

976
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:56,947
Gentlemen, let's go
check into our new home.

977
01:13:57,072 --> 01:13:58,949
Come on, Junior.

978
01:14:06,081 --> 01:14:07,958
Junior! Hey!

979
01:14:13,088 --> 01:14:14,965
Junior.

980
01:14:18,218 --> 01:14:20,720
Now a lot of coaches would be
giving you one of those, uh...

981
01:14:20,845 --> 01:14:23,515
"Win one for the Gipper"
speeches.

982
01:14:23,640 --> 01:14:26,643
I'm not good at that stuff.
Instead, I thought I'd, uh...

983
01:14:26,768 --> 01:14:29,395
lead you in a psalm
of inspiration.

984
01:14:29,521 --> 01:14:31,397
Let's bow our heads.

985
01:14:31,523 --> 01:14:33,525
Who's the "Gipper"?

986
01:14:33,650 --> 01:14:38,530
Our Father who art in Calgary,
bobsled be Thy name.

987
01:14:38,655 --> 01:14:41,658
Thy kingdom come,
gold medals won...

988
01:14:41,783 --> 01:14:44,035
on Earth as it is
in turn seven.

989
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:46,955
With liberty and justice
for Jamaica and Haile Selassie.

990
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:49,499
- Amen.
- All right!

991
01:14:49,624 --> 01:14:51,918
- Yes!
- Respect.

992
01:14:52,043 --> 01:14:53,920
- All right.
- Jah Rastafari.

993
01:15:04,388 --> 01:15:06,265
Junior.

994
01:15:10,936 --> 01:15:12,813
Now you listen to me, boy.

995
01:15:15,274 --> 01:15:17,651
You might not have done
what you were asked...

996
01:15:17,776 --> 01:15:20,445
but you will do
what you're told.

997
01:15:20,570 --> 01:15:23,156
- You're coming home.
- Yeah, but, Father,
you know I just want...

998
01:15:23,282 --> 01:15:25,492
But nothing.

999
01:15:25,617 --> 01:15:27,786
I didn't send you
to the finest school...

1000
01:15:27,911 --> 01:15:31,999
for you to go around
sliding on your backside.

1001
01:15:32,124 --> 01:15:34,918
- You must be mad.
- Yeah, but the team needs me.

1002
01:15:35,043 --> 01:15:37,587
I don't want to hear
any more of it.

1003
01:15:38,964 --> 01:15:40,923
Go and get your things.

1004
01:15:52,643 --> 01:15:54,520
I'll wait in the lobby.

1005
01:16:00,151 --> 01:16:02,778
Pride. Power.

1006
01:16:06,365 --> 01:16:10,411
Father, when you look
at me, what do you see?

1007
01:16:10,536 --> 01:16:12,663
I don't have time
for games, Junior.

1008
01:16:12,788 --> 01:16:14,707
Tell me what ya see!

1009
01:16:14,832 --> 01:16:17,376
Please.

1010
01:16:17,501 --> 01:16:19,462
All right, I'll tell you
what I see.

1011
01:16:19,587 --> 01:16:21,463
I see a lost little boy...

1012
01:16:21,588 --> 01:16:25,550
who's lucky to have a father
who knows what's best for him.

1013
01:16:25,675 --> 01:16:29,512
No, no, no, no. You don't know
what's best for me, Father.

1014
01:16:29,637 --> 01:16:32,807
I am not a lost
little boy, Father.

1015
01:16:32,932 --> 01:16:34,809
I am a man.

1016
01:16:34,934 --> 01:16:37,020
And I'm an Olympian.

1017
01:16:39,898 --> 01:16:41,941
I'm stayin' right here.

1018
01:16:53,787 --> 01:16:56,748
Hey, Junior Bevil.

1019
01:16:56,873 --> 01:16:58,917
You're a badass mother.

1020
01:17:15,390 --> 01:17:18,769
- Here, I-I got a couple.
- I like this one. Yes.

1021
01:17:24,399 --> 01:17:27,736
O Canada, indeed. This is Al Trautwig
along with John Morgan.

1022
01:17:27,861 --> 01:17:30,489
We're live at Olympic Park,
the brand-new bobsledding venue...

1023
01:17:30,614 --> 01:17:32,866
just a few miles outside
of downtown Calgary.

1024
01:17:32,991 --> 01:17:35,327
Everybody, shut up.
It's starting.

1025
01:17:35,452 --> 01:17:38,622
...extremely intense, exciting
competition for the next three days.

1026
01:17:47,255 --> 01:17:50,466
I am feeling very Olympic
today. How about you?

1027
01:17:53,928 --> 01:17:56,764
Uh, this sport, as we well know,
us made up of athletes...

1028
01:17:56,889 --> 01:17:59,475
who go to the edge and sometimes
beyond, and it is why we believe...

1029
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:02,728
the next three days is going to be
extremely competitive and exciting.

1030
01:18:02,853 --> 01:18:06,148
And already, John, on day one,
we're starting things off
with a gold medal favorite.

1031
01:18:06,274 --> 01:18:09,318
Well, the Swiss were fortunate enough
to draw number one in the competition.

1032
01:18:09,443 --> 01:18:11,696
We gotta make them the odds-on
favorite to win the gold.

1033
01:18:11,821 --> 01:18:15,032
But the East Germans, they're comin'
off the gold medal win in 1984.

1034
01:18:15,157 --> 01:18:17,493
The Canadians, it's their home track.
You gotta favor them too.

1035
01:18:17,618 --> 01:18:19,954
And they've been doin'
very well in practice all week.

1036
01:18:27,210 --> 01:18:30,130
Eins, zwei, drei.

1037
01:18:36,177 --> 01:18:39,097
One! Two! Three! Go!

1038
01:18:53,194 --> 01:18:55,280
- Eighty miles an hour or close to it.
- You know, Al,

1039
01:18:55,405 --> 01:18:58,033
I'm lookin' at the times here, and
the course is gettin' extremely fast.

1040
01:18:58,158 --> 01:19:00,243
And I was worried about that Austrian
team's safety in that last big...

1041
01:19:00,368 --> 01:19:03,288
180-degree whiparound that draws
four G's of force on the athletes.

1042
01:19:03,413 --> 01:19:06,791
Well, if you were worried about
them, what are you thinking
about our last and next team?

1043
01:19:06,916 --> 01:19:10,294
Yes, it certainly seems
strange that surrounded by
the ice and snow of Calgary,

1044
01:19:10,419 --> 01:19:14,298
we are about to watch a team
from the tiny island of Jamaica.

1045
01:19:16,508 --> 01:19:19,303
- From Jamaica!
- Quite a story for them
to even get here.

1046
01:19:19,428 --> 01:19:22,681
They came out of nowhere. And
you know, there's a lot of teams
up here on top of the hill...

1047
01:19:22,806 --> 01:19:25,601
that sort of feel the Jamaicans
don't belong here.

1048
01:19:33,025 --> 01:19:35,736
- Hey! Hey!
- Hey, what are you doin', man?

1049
01:19:35,861 --> 01:19:38,739
- What are you doing?
- That's what the Swiss do
to psych themselves up.

1050
01:19:38,864 --> 01:19:42,409
They also make them little pocketknives,
too, but I don't see you doin' that.

1051
01:19:42,534 --> 01:19:45,913
All right, guys, we're up. Come on. Hey,
knock it off. Knock it off, will ya?

1052
01:19:46,038 --> 01:19:48,248
Okay. Let's go.
Come on.

1053
01:19:48,373 --> 01:19:52,251
Take your start positions.
Remember, we don't have to win
the gold in the first day.

1054
01:19:52,376 --> 01:19:54,462
- It's just like any other run.
- Except this time...

1055
01:19:54,587 --> 01:19:56,547
100 million people watching.

1056
01:19:56,672 --> 01:19:59,592
Derice, did you forget
something? Thank you.

1057
01:19:59,717 --> 01:20:01,636
- Ready.
- Ready.

1058
01:20:01,761 --> 01:20:03,387
- Ready.
- Ready.

1059
01:20:03,513 --> 01:20:07,892
Eins, zwei, drei.

1060
01:20:09,185 --> 01:20:12,271
Go! Go, go, go, go! Go!

1061
01:20:14,732 --> 01:20:18,027
- Get in! Get in!
- As the Jamaican team attempts
its first ever...

1062
01:20:18,152 --> 01:20:20,613
winter Olympic event,
and look at this.

1063
01:20:20,738 --> 01:20:24,158
They've gotta get into that sled.
I've never seen anything like this.

1064
01:20:24,283 --> 01:20:27,370
I know it's not funny,
but how embarrassing.

1065
01:20:27,495 --> 01:20:30,206
Now, thank goodness. For
a minute, I didn't think they'd
ever get all four of them in.

1066
01:20:30,331 --> 01:20:32,916
And that could've been
a disaster.

1067
01:20:33,041 --> 01:20:35,627
C-Come on!

1068
01:20:35,752 --> 01:20:37,629
Well, most importantly here,
when you do get in the sled...

1069
01:20:37,754 --> 01:20:40,131
you have to get in with catlike
movements, get in, get relaxed.

1070
01:20:40,257 --> 01:20:44,553
Ooh, look at that high line at
Omega! He bounces off the wall,
ricochets like a pinball.

1071
01:20:44,678 --> 01:20:47,848
You know, the driver here,
Derice Bannock, looks like
the sled's really drivin' him.

1072
01:20:47,973 --> 01:20:52,477
- That fool better watch his mouth.
- He better watch more than that.

1073
01:20:52,602 --> 01:20:56,356
This is the time when this team
may be thinking, "This may not
have been such a great idea."

1074
01:20:56,481 --> 01:20:58,525
Their heads are bouncing around.
This is amazing.

1075
01:20:58,650 --> 01:21:00,986
Like rag dolls as they come
through the finish...

1076
01:21:01,111 --> 01:21:04,155
at a time of 58.04...

1077
01:21:04,281 --> 01:21:06,908
which will be good enough
for last place.

1078
01:21:13,414 --> 01:21:18,711
You choked. It was yours for
the taking, and you choked.

1079
01:21:18,836 --> 01:21:21,380
You were ready,
and ya choked.

1080
01:21:22,881 --> 01:21:25,384
Well, maybe we should
go over the turns again?

1081
01:21:25,509 --> 01:21:27,720
You know the turns.

1082
01:21:27,845 --> 01:21:30,264
You know everything there is
to know about this sport.

1083
01:21:30,389 --> 01:21:33,142
I'll tell you somethin'.
You had all better figure out...

1084
01:21:33,267 --> 01:21:36,020
how to stay loose out there.

1085
01:21:36,145 --> 01:21:39,690
That's somethin'
I can't help you with.

1086
01:21:39,815 --> 01:21:42,484
I'll see you tomorrow
on the hill.

1087
01:21:57,081 --> 01:21:59,834
You know, when the Swiss
want to get relaxed...

1088
01:21:59,959 --> 01:22:02,920
Will you shut up
about the damn Swiss?

1089
01:22:03,046 --> 01:22:07,425
I mean, it was all that "eins,
zwei, drei" nonsense that got us
all nervous in the first place.

1090
01:22:07,550 --> 01:22:10,428
Hey, man, look here. I'm just tryin'
to get us off on the right foot.

1091
01:22:10,553 --> 01:22:13,431
Well, the right foot for us
is not the Swiss foot.

1092
01:22:13,556 --> 01:22:17,894
I mean, come on, Derice. We
can't be copyin' nobody else's
style. We have our own style.

1093
01:22:18,019 --> 01:22:20,271
Kissin' an egg
is no kind of style.

1094
01:22:20,396 --> 01:22:23,691
It's the Olympics here.
It's no stupid pushcart derby.

1095
01:22:29,030 --> 01:22:31,157
Let me tell ya
somethin', Rasta.

1096
01:22:31,282 --> 01:22:34,243
I didn't come up here to forget
who I am and where I come from.

1097
01:22:34,369 --> 01:22:38,497
And neither did I. I'm just
tryin' to be the best I can be.

1098
01:22:38,622 --> 01:22:42,084
So am I. And the best
I can be is Jamaican.

1099
01:22:48,423 --> 01:22:54,262
Look. Derice, I've known you since Julie
Jeffries asked to see your ding-a-ling.

1100
01:22:54,387 --> 01:22:57,015
And I'm telling you
as a friend...

1101
01:22:57,140 --> 01:22:59,768
if we look Jamaican,
walk Jamaican...

1102
01:22:59,893 --> 01:23:02,479
talk Jamaican
and is Jamaican...

1103
01:23:02,604 --> 01:23:05,941
then we sure as hell
better bobsled Jamaican.

1104
01:23:13,740 --> 01:23:15,784
Greetings from Jamaica

1105
01:23:15,909 --> 01:23:18,410
'Nuff people will say
you know they can't believe

1106
01:23:18,536 --> 01:23:20,830
Jamaica we have
a bobsled team

1107
01:23:20,955 --> 01:23:23,124
'Nuff people say
you know they can't believe

1108
01:23:23,249 --> 01:23:25,292
Jamaica we have
a bobsled team

1109
01:23:25,417 --> 01:23:27,753
We have the one Derice
and the one Junior

1110
01:23:27,878 --> 01:23:30,131
- Thank you.
- Yul Brenner and the man Sanka

1111
01:23:30,256 --> 01:23:32,758
The fastest of the fastest
of Jamaican sprinters

1112
01:23:32,883 --> 01:23:34,844
Respect to the man
Irv Blitzer

1113
01:23:34,969 --> 01:23:37,221
- All right, gentlemen, this is it.
- Respect.

1114
01:23:37,346 --> 01:23:39,306
- Respect! Whoo!
- All right.
- Let's go!

1115
01:23:39,431 --> 01:23:43,227
We now come to the second chance for
the four intrepid men from Jamaica.

1116
01:23:43,352 --> 01:23:46,188
- What do they have to do, John?
- In reality, Al, I don't think
the Jamaicans...

1117
01:23:46,313 --> 01:23:48,816
- have any chance of winning a medal.
- Dear God!

1118
01:23:48,941 --> 01:23:51,902
Just let them be better
than yesterday.

1119
01:23:56,282 --> 01:23:58,325
- Ready.
- Ready.

1120
01:23:58,449 --> 01:24:01,202
Feel the rhythm!
Feel the rhyme!

1121
01:24:01,327 --> 01:24:03,997
Get on up!
It's bobsled time!

1122
01:24:04,122 --> 01:24:07,458
Cool runnings!

1123
01:24:07,584 --> 01:24:10,670
Bob in track.

1124
01:24:10,795 --> 01:24:14,299
That's a hair faster than the
Swiss. Boy, that's a real big
difference from yesterday.

1125
01:24:14,424 --> 01:24:16,467
Well, this is an absolute shock
in the making. Yesterday...

1126
01:24:16,593 --> 01:24:18,845
- they were falling down
almost at the start.
- Yes!

1127
01:24:18,970 --> 01:24:22,056
Now they slide into place. Yesterday,
their heads were bobbing everywhere.

1128
01:24:22,181 --> 01:24:25,476
Today, they're
almost in unison.

1129
01:24:37,822 --> 01:24:40,073
- Can this really be happening?
- Boy, what a difference!

1130
01:24:40,198 --> 01:24:44,119
Flying through the Omega,
looking possessed here. It's not
the same team we saw yesterday.

1131
01:24:44,244 --> 01:24:47,205
- Where did these guys come from?
- Jamaica!

1132
01:24:54,588 --> 01:24:57,591
Wow! 56.53!

1133
01:24:57,716 --> 01:25:00,093
Whoo-hoo! Yes! Yes!

1134
01:25:00,218 --> 01:25:03,096
- Did you hear that time? Yes!
- Yeah.

1135
01:25:12,814 --> 01:25:14,733
- That moves them up into 8th place.
- Watch out, world.

1136
01:25:14,858 --> 01:25:17,569
The Jamaicans are coming.

1137
01:25:35,961 --> 01:25:37,838
Derice, you in here?

1138
01:25:37,963 --> 01:25:40,132
Hey, Coach.

1139
01:25:40,257 --> 01:25:43,427
Oh, there ya are.
How you feelin'?

1140
01:25:43,552 --> 01:25:45,429
- All right.
- Good, good.

1141
01:25:45,554 --> 01:25:48,057
You all set to follow
in your father's footsteps?

1142
01:25:48,182 --> 01:25:51,394
- I think so.
- You think so?

1143
01:25:51,519 --> 01:25:54,438
- All right, I know so.
- That's more like it.

1144
01:25:54,563 --> 01:25:57,108
We're gonna go grab a bite
to eat. You wanna join us?

1145
01:25:57,233 --> 01:25:59,902
- Nah.
- I didn't think so. I'll
pick you somethin' up.

1146
01:26:01,195 --> 01:26:03,072
- Hey, Coach.
- Yeah.

1147
01:26:03,197 --> 01:26:05,949
- I have to ask you a question.
- Sure.

1148
01:26:06,074 --> 01:26:08,910
But you don't have to answer
if you don't want to.

1149
01:26:09,035 --> 01:26:14,165
I mean, I want you to, but
if you can't, I understand.

1150
01:26:14,290 --> 01:26:17,001
You wanna know why
I cheated, right?

1151
01:26:17,127 --> 01:26:19,420
Yes, I do.

1152
01:26:22,632 --> 01:26:24,509
That's a fair question.

1153
01:26:27,053 --> 01:26:28,930
It's quite simple, really.

1154
01:26:31,307 --> 01:26:33,184
I had to win.

1155
01:26:34,894 --> 01:26:37,105
You see, Derice...

1156
01:26:37,230 --> 01:26:39,566
I'd made winning
my whole life...

1157
01:26:39,691 --> 01:26:42,318
and when you make winning
your whole life...

1158
01:26:42,443 --> 01:26:44,987
ya have to keep on winning,
no matter what.

1159
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:48,157
You understand that?

1160
01:26:48,282 --> 01:26:50,826
No, I don't understand, Coach.

1161
01:26:50,951 --> 01:26:54,371
You had two gold medals.
You had it all.

1162
01:26:56,415 --> 01:26:58,292
Derice...

1163
01:26:59,501 --> 01:27:01,795
a gold medal
is a wonderful thing.

1164
01:27:04,631 --> 01:27:07,843
But if you're not enough
without it...

1165
01:27:07,968 --> 01:27:10,762
you'll never be enough
with it.

1166
01:27:15,225 --> 01:27:17,102
Hey, Coach...

1167
01:27:19,605 --> 01:27:21,481
how will I know
if I'm enough?

1168
01:27:23,609 --> 01:27:26,611
When you cross that
finish line, you'll know.

1169
01:27:33,326 --> 01:27:37,914
Welcome back to the bobsledding
venue for this, the last day of
competition. It's medal time...

1170
01:27:38,039 --> 01:27:41,208
and, John, the top six teams
are separated by only half a second.

1171
01:27:41,334 --> 01:27:43,544
- So it's very close, and
that's been predictable...
- I didn't expect...

1172
01:27:43,669 --> 01:27:46,213
- to see you here.
- Well, my dear...

1173
01:27:46,339 --> 01:27:48,299
we've got a team
in the Olympics, don't we?

1174
01:27:48,424 --> 01:27:51,385
Most astonishing is the
Jamaicans. They still have a
chance to win an Olympic medal.

1175
01:27:51,510 --> 01:27:55,056
Everybody, shut up.
My boy's on TV.

1176
01:27:55,181 --> 01:27:57,224
And you're not the only one
to get excited about that.

1177
01:27:57,350 --> 01:28:00,519
I think the fans here have an
extreme case of Jamaican fever.

1178
01:28:00,645 --> 01:28:03,397
- Al, so do I.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

1179
01:28:03,522 --> 01:28:06,776
So do we. Do I have to tell you
whose turn it is now?

1180
01:28:06,984 --> 01:28:09,277
- Jamaica, to your start positions.
- Respect!

1181
01:28:14,908 --> 01:28:18,328
Hey, dreadlocks, let me
kiss your lucky egg.

1182
01:28:18,453 --> 01:28:21,247
- Next team up is Jamaica.
- All right, fellas, that's us!

1183
01:28:21,373 --> 01:28:24,584
Let's go! Here we go!
Today's our day! This is it!

1184
01:28:24,709 --> 01:28:26,586
Come on, guys.
We can do it!

1185
01:28:26,711 --> 01:28:30,507
Derice! I'll see ya
at the finish line.

1186
01:28:30,632 --> 01:28:33,510
- With the kinds of push starts
these guys are capable of...
- All right, it's all yours. Go!

1187
01:28:33,635 --> 01:28:37,222
We might actually see the
Jamaicans win an Olympic medal.

1188
01:28:37,347 --> 01:28:40,517
So this is it. We could
see history in the making.

1189
01:28:40,642 --> 01:28:43,436
Feel the rhythm!
Feel the rhyme!

1190
01:28:43,561 --> 01:28:46,481
Get on up!
It's bobsled time!

1191
01:28:46,606 --> 01:28:49,651
- Cool runnings!
- On the track.

1192
01:28:52,903 --> 01:28:56,156
Go! Go! Go!
Move that bobsled! Go!

1193
01:28:56,281 --> 01:28:58,951
One, two, three, four, all of
them in, and look at them fly.

1194
01:28:59,076 --> 01:29:02,037
Oh, man, they shaved another
couple hundredths off the start.

1195
01:29:02,162 --> 01:29:05,124
Al, they get better
every time down the track.

1196
01:29:05,249 --> 01:29:09,670
Go, Derice! Move!
Take that bobsled and move!

1197
01:29:09,795 --> 01:29:13,006
Look at the way the sled's comin' in
and out of the corners. Very smooth.

1198
01:29:13,132 --> 01:29:16,510
It's like he's been drivin'
the sled for ten years. Bannock
looks really possessed here.

1199
01:29:16,635 --> 01:29:18,929
Oh, what the heck.
Go, Jams!

1200
01:29:32,775 --> 01:29:37,446
What a run Bannock is having.
He's letting loose on this
extremely fast course.

1201
01:29:39,448 --> 01:29:41,659
And even with that
rickety old sled...

1202
01:29:41,784 --> 01:29:46,205
the Jamaicans are
flying through the turns.

1203
01:29:46,330 --> 01:29:49,167
This does not look good.
Something's gotta be wrong.

1204
01:29:49,292 --> 01:29:53,004
The Jamaicans on a record pace
as they fly almost out of
control around the turn.

1205
01:29:53,129 --> 01:29:55,006
- Move it! Move it! Move that sled!
- Now the speed seems too much...

1206
01:29:55,131 --> 01:29:58,092
and I don't think he's going
to be able to hold it. Oh!

1207
01:30:52,479 --> 01:30:55,981
Derice, you dead?

1208
01:30:56,106 --> 01:30:58,901
No, man, I'm not dead.

1209
01:31:05,157 --> 01:31:07,159
We have to finish the race.

1210
01:31:24,885 --> 01:31:26,762
Excuse me, please.

1211
01:31:31,100 --> 01:31:32,976
Excuse me.

1212
01:33:32,218 --> 01:33:34,178
Sehr gut, Jamaica.

1213
01:33:34,303 --> 01:33:36,138
We'll see you
in four years, ja?

1214
01:33:36,263 --> 01:33:38,557
Yeah, man.

1215
01:33:41,517 --> 01:33:44,062
Junior Bevil.

1216
01:33:44,187 --> 01:33:46,356
But it doesn't mean
that I like you.

1217
01:33:46,481 --> 01:33:48,942
We split.

1218
01:34:01,788 --> 01:34:04,582
- Thanks, Irv.
- Thank you.

1219
01:34:06,209 --> 01:34:09,671
- All right. Hey, guys.
- Hey, Coach.

1220
01:34:09,796 --> 01:34:11,756
- Coach.
- I'm so proud of you guys.
You all right?

1221
01:34:11,881 --> 01:34:13,925
- I love you, man.
- Can I get a picture, please?

1222
01:35:04,432 --> 01:35:06,809
I can see clearly now

1223
01:35:06,934 --> 01:35:08,811
The rain is gone

1224
01:35:12,356 --> 01:35:15,317
I can see all obstacles

1225
01:35:15,443 --> 01:35:17,319
In my way

1226
01:35:20,406 --> 01:35:22,825
Gone are the dark clouds

1227
01:35:22,950 --> 01:35:25,161
That had me blind

1228
01:35:26,287 --> 01:35:28,289
It's gonna be a bright

1229
01:35:28,414 --> 01:35:32,042
- Bright, bright
- Bright sunshiney day

1230
01:35:34,295 --> 01:35:36,297
It's gonna be a bright

1231
01:35:36,422 --> 01:35:40,009
- Bright, bright
- Bright sunshiney day

1232
01:35:44,346 --> 01:35:46,890
Oh, yes, I can make it now

1233
01:35:47,015 --> 01:35:49,309
The pain is gone

1234
01:35:52,479 --> 01:35:54,898
All of the bad feelings

1235
01:35:55,023 --> 01:35:57,358
Have disappeared

1236
01:36:00,445 --> 01:36:02,197
Here is that rainbow

1237
01:36:02,322 --> 01:36:05,074
I've been prayin' for

1238
01:36:06,242 --> 01:36:08,286
It's gonna be a bright

1239
01:36:08,411 --> 01:36:11,873
- Bright, bright
- Bright sunshiney day

1240
01:36:16,377 --> 01:36:18,171
Look all around

1241
01:36:18,296 --> 01:36:22,842
There's nothing
but blue skies

1242
01:36:24,385 --> 01:36:26,054
Look straight ahead

1243
01:36:26,179 --> 01:36:30,349
There's nothing
but blue skies

1244
01:36:45,656 --> 01:36:48,116
Oy, you know
people can't believe

1245
01:36:48,242 --> 01:36:50,410
Jamaica have a bobsled team

1246
01:36:50,535 --> 01:36:55,123
We have no snow
Just food and water

1247
01:36:55,249 --> 01:36:59,962
And the temperature ranges
from hot to hotter

1248
01:37:00,087 --> 01:37:04,591
No spring, no fall
much less no winter

1249
01:37:04,716 --> 01:37:07,010
And yet we have
a bobsled team

1250
01:37:07,135 --> 01:37:09,012
Holding on
to an Olympic dream

1251
01:37:09,136 --> 01:37:12,223
We say them ready I'm always say
them ready Them ready like Freddy

1252
01:37:12,348 --> 01:37:14,684
You see them funny sled
You see the world steady

1253
01:37:14,809 --> 01:37:16,978
When they make the motion
Them a rock and a dolly

1254
01:37:17,103 --> 01:37:19,146
A country on a sled
with a wish in them body

1255
01:37:19,271 --> 01:37:21,691
Yes, my four men
are my bobsled posse

1256
01:37:21,816 --> 01:37:23,943
Yul Brenner, Derice, Junior
Sanka, the men are ready

1257
01:37:24,068 --> 01:37:28,531
When them reach the Olympics
we're proud and irie, irie, irie

1258
01:37:28,656 --> 01:37:31,283
Lord, you know
people can't believe

1259
01:37:31,409 --> 01:37:33,452
Jamaica have a bobsled team

1260
01:37:33,577 --> 01:37:36,080
Boy, you know

1261
01:37:36,205 --> 01:37:38,249
Jamaica have a bobsled team

1262
01:37:38,374 --> 01:37:40,793
Lord, you know

1263
01:37:40,918 --> 01:37:42,962
Jamaica have a bobsled team

1264
01:37:43,087 --> 01:37:45,631
Boy, you know

1265
01:37:45,756 --> 01:37:47,717

1266
01:37:47,842 --> 01:37:53,388
