00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:09,220
Want a hot dog?

2
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:10,483
No, thanks.

3
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:12,047
Just ketchup, please.

4
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:16,921
Thanks.

5
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:18,691
Listen, I've got
an errand to run.

6
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:24,298
Kind of skimpy
on the ketchup.

7
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,533
Duncan, I've got to do this alone.

8
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:28,869
What?
Wait, wait, wait.

9
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:30,375
You called me in Paris,

10
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:32,934
and you said,
"We have to meet."

11
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:36,038
Now suddenly you've
got an errand to run?

12
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:38,345
What's going on?

13
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:40,147
I don't know.

14
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,380
It's...

15
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,183
nothing.

16
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:46,782
You okay?

17
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:51,424
Yeah. I'm okay.

18
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:52,930
Really.

19
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:56,491
I know you better
than that, Connor.

20
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,503
Haven't seen you like this.

21
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:02,975
People change, Duncan.

22
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:05,237
You'll learn that.

23
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:06,903
Fine.

24
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,210
You can tell me
all about it tonight.

25
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:12,080
8:00 at the bar.

26
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:14,381
And you're buying.

27
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:16,217
Right.

28
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:18,689
8:00, and I'm buying.

29
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,123
Mm-hmm.

30
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:24,822
You sure you gonna be
all right, Connor?

31
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:26,489
Of course.

32
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:27,658
Duncan...

33
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:33,472
watch your back.

34
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:02,223
Connor?

35
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,404
Connor?

36
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:49,681
<i>Okay.</i>

37
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:53,240
<i>What is it, Connor?</i>

38
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:54,343
<i>Open it.</i>

39
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,944
<i>Oh, a ballerina.</i>

40
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:59,253
Wow. She's beautiful.

41
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:01,190
<i>Thank you.</i>

42
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,727
Mmm, my angel.

43
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:10,462
<i>Oh, my God,</i>
<i>I'm so proud of you.</i>

44
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:11,560
I love you, Connor.

45
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:13,070
I love you, my Rachel.

46
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:14,731
<i>Oh, God,</i>
<i>I'm proud of you.</i>

47
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:15,774
<i>Thank you.</i>

48
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:46,535
Hello?

49
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:58,440
Rachel!

50
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:04,179
<i>Rachel.</i>

51
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,282
<i>My beloved Rachel.</i>

52
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:13,331
<i>How long has it been</i>
<i>since she died?</i>

53
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:17,301
<i>A year?</i>
<i>A century? More?</i>

54
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,395
<i>My mind keeps slipping,</i>

55
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:22,703
<i>but some things I know.</i>

56
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:25,744
<i>I am Connor MacLeod</i>
<i>of the Clan MacLeod,</i>

57
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:30,772
<i>and once,</i>
<i>a very long time ago,</i>

58
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:33,284
<i>I was a Highlander.</i>

59
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:47,023
<i>Born of this land,</i>

60
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:50,159
<i>and like this land, immortal.</i>

61
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:02,071
<i>Witch!</i>

62
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,979
<i>You brought</i>
<i>this plague on us.</i>

63
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:07,213
<i>You damned us all,</i>
<i>Connor MacLeod.</i>

64
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:08,981
You sold your soul!

65
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:11,683
<i>You're a witch!</i>

66
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:12,689
<i>You child of Satan!</i>

67
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:13,884
They drove you from your home,

68
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,087
cut you off
from your own people.

69
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,993
What else do they want?

70
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:19,429
Someone to blame.

71
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,364
Your mother will burn!

72
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:22,867
Connor.

73
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:24,664
Your mother <i>will</i> burn!

74
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:26,329
Rot in hell!

75
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:28,032
Get in the house.

76
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:30,803
<i>Get off my land!</i>

77
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:32,504
<i>Leave us in peace!</i>

78
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:33,909
<i>Get off my land!</i>

79
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:41,116
<i>Connor, please.</i>

80
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,280
You're not going back
to Glenfinnan.

81
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,187
I have no choice.

82
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:46,691
Connor, please.

83
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:49,523
They can't hurt me,
and they know it,

84
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:52,325
but they can still
hurt the ones I love.

85
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:54,696
I'm afraid.

86
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:57,899
I love you, Heather.

87
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:00,165
More than anything in this world.

88
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:02,571
<i>Do you believe me?</i>

89
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:03,574
Yes.

90
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:05,372
Then don't be afraid.

91
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:07,708
<i>Nothing can keep me from you.</i>

92
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:16,755
Nothing.

93
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:08,571
Connor.

94
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:12,607
I thought you might be
the water horse...

95
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:16,136
come to take me on his back
and drown me in the loch.

96
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:26,456
No one comes
to take care of you?

97
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:28,117
<i>Not in years.</i>

98
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:29,923
They think I bedevil
their children...

99
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:32,624
because my own was banished.

100
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:37,625
I'm sorry.

101
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:39,193
I'm so sorry.

102
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:43,539
Tiny mites...

103
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:46,271
and soured dispositions.

104
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:49,676
I've no need of them, Connor,

105
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:51,546
any of them.

106
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:58,547
Then it's settled.

107
00:10:58,624 --> 00:10:59,955
You're coming with me.

108
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:07,664
Aah!

109
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:09,428
Connor!

110
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:10,992
Connor, what is it?

111
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,503
I'm not sure.

112
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:14,163
It happened once before.

113
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,229
Aah!

114
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:16,865
Aah! Connor!

115
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:24,139
<i>In the name</i>
<i>of the Holy See...</i>

116
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:27,185
<i>and the rule of law,</i>

117
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:29,721
<i>you are hereby charged,</i>

118
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:32,223
Connor MacLeod,

119
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:33,485
<i>with heresy...</i>

120
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:35,220
and the practice
of black magic.

121
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:37,819
We were friends, remember, Jacob?

122
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:39,660
<i>I stood at your ordination.</i>

123
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:41,131
I vouched for you.

124
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,963
You shouldn't have
come back, Connor.

125
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,400
<i>Take him.</i>

126
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:46,570
Aah!

127
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,270
<i>The ties of blood...</i>

128
00:11:56,348 --> 00:12:01,285
<i>cannot be severed</i>
<i>by word or deed.</i>

129
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:09,994
<i>Mother.</i>

130
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:11,927
<i>Due to</i>
<i>the infinite compassion...</i>

131
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:18,963
you are entitled
to one final opportunity...

132
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:20,972
to renounce all that is unholy,

133
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,568
and declare Connor MacLeod
not of your loins.

134
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:28,976
How say you,
Caiolin MacLeod?

135
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:33,580
If your God...

136
00:12:33,652 --> 00:12:37,782
should persecute me
into the next world,

137
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:40,849
then I shall simply have
to find myself another.

138
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:44,927
<i>Burn her!</i>

139
00:12:44,997 --> 00:12:47,329
No! No! No!

140
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:50,626
<i>He is your son.</i>

141
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:53,638
I am silent for you.

142
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:02,846
<i>Black powder.</i>

143
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:04,314
It will ease your suffering.

144
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:09,519
<i>Mother!</i>

145
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,358
No!

146
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:19,793
No!

147
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:51,426
<i>You're next, you demon!</i>

148
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:02,000
Aah!

149
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:24,961
Aah!

150
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:29,996
My water horse.

151
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,115
Unh!

152
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:55,756
<i>The Devil's come back to life!</i>

153
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:06,697
<i>Let her be, Connor.</i>

154
00:15:07,773 --> 00:15:09,263
Aah!

155
00:15:13,545 --> 00:15:14,477
Father?

156
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:16,639
<i>Father?</i>

157
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,573
Please.

158
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:21,711
Do not leave me.

159
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:24,616
Father.

160
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:37,802
Aah!

161
00:15:44,743 --> 00:15:46,472
Connor--

162
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,577
<i>My endless days...</i>

163
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:31,282
<i>are filled with memories</i>
<i>of the past...</i>

164
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:34,417
<i>and the death of my mother</i>
<i>by Jacob Kell.</i>

165
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:14,223
<i>Boy, you people are</i>
<i>extremely difficult to find.</i>

166
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:15,960
We like it that way.

167
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:27,475
Go ahead, man.
Take your pick.

168
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:30,246
Unh!

169
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:39,916
Uhh!

170
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:42,955
Aah!

171
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,787
Aah.

172
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,601
Take their heads.

173
00:18:56,668 --> 00:18:58,329
They might be Immortals.

174
00:18:58,403 --> 00:19:00,462
Yes, they might be.

175
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:16,415
Aah!

176
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,864
Don't be long.

177
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:47,878
The Sanctuary.

178
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:50,649
So it's true.

179
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:02,733
What sacrifices
they have made of you,

180
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:06,737
warehoused like
rotting pieces of meat.

181
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:13,372
Tell me,

182
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:16,505
is this... the better way?

183
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:21,144
<i>I'm sure you've had</i>
<i>time to reflect upon it.</i>

184
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:24,722
What you need to understand...

185
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:27,657
is that <i>I</i> don't care
about the game.

186
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:30,194
<i>I don't care about the rules.</i>

187
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:33,754
I don't even care about
these pathetic souls...

188
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:39,031
<i>you keep locked away</i>
<i>as a barrier to the prize.</i>

189
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:43,541
<i>Which one is</i>
<i>Connor MacLeod?</i>

190
00:21:47,005 --> 00:21:48,939
Well, what do we do now?

191
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:51,441
What we always do.

192
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:53,637
We're Watchers, not cops.

193
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:55,873
<i>We'll find another volunteer.</i>

194
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:44,318
<i>Whatever you fear</i>
<i>about Connor MacLeod,</i>

195
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:45,954
<i>fear the worst.</i>

196
00:22:48,266 --> 00:22:49,392
Who is this?

197
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:50,935
A friend.

198
00:22:51,002 --> 00:22:54,233
<i>Don't bother looking for me, Duncan.</i>

199
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:06,747
He's on the move.

200
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:19,596
Duncan MacLeod
of the Clan MacLeod.

201
00:23:19,664 --> 00:23:21,655
Hello, Methos.

202
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:24,827
<i>What brings you</i>
<i>to my humble abode?</i>

203
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:27,030
Need your help.

204
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:28,402
Why me?

205
00:23:28,473 --> 00:23:31,101
<i>You've been around for 5,000 years.</i>

206
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:35,738
I want the benefit
of your experience.

207
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:39,215
And I thought
it was a social call.

208
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:42,386
You ever had nightmares?

209
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:44,888
What kind of nightmares?

210
00:23:44,956 --> 00:23:46,150
Bloody images...

211
00:23:46,224 --> 00:23:49,057
powerful enough to even
break your meditation.

212
00:23:49,127 --> 00:23:52,995
We live violent lives, MacLeod.

213
00:23:53,064 --> 00:23:55,055
Some of that's
bound to stay with us.

214
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,830
These ones came
10 years to the day...

215
00:23:57,903 --> 00:23:59,632
that Connor MacLeod disappeared.

216
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,973
Connor had good reason to go.

217
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:05,373
He told me how much
Rachel meant to him.

218
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:08,880
<i>There was more to it than that.</i>
<i>I was with him that day.</i>

219
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:10,847
<i>The day Rachel was killed?</i>

220
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:13,248
Something wasn't right.

221
00:24:13,318 --> 00:24:14,546
<i>Connor, you okay?</i>

222
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:18,555
Yeah. I'm okay.
Really.

223
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:21,183
I know you better
than that, Connor.

224
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:24,490
I've never seen you like this.

225
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:27,623
People change, Duncan.

226
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:29,291
You'll learn that.

227
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:33,501
I need to know
if he's still alive, Methos.

228
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:37,198
You know a little
about Buddhist monks.

229
00:24:37,275 --> 00:24:39,209
Some of them come
to cherish life so much...

230
00:24:39,277 --> 00:24:43,304
that to step on an insect
or harm a blade of grass...

231
00:24:43,381 --> 00:24:45,508
becomes a violation
of their creed,

232
00:24:45,584 --> 00:24:47,347
so they place themselves
under an extreme form...

233
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:49,444
of protective custody--

234
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:52,183
A Sanctuary of sorts.

235
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:53,952
<i>Well, for an Immortal...</i>

236
00:24:54,025 --> 00:24:55,652
who comes to abhor
the bloodshed,

237
00:24:55,727 --> 00:24:58,093
there's a similar solution--

238
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:00,723
Away to be removed
from the game forever.

239
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,824
<i>The price</i>
<i>is unimaginably high,</i>

240
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:04,994
<i>but you are, for</i>
<i>all practical purposes,</i>

241
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:09,439
protected from
the violence within you.

242
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:11,635
And it's called The Sanctuary.

243
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:13,678
Connor would never do that.

244
00:25:13,745 --> 00:25:14,973
<i>Are you sure?</i>

245
00:25:15,046 --> 00:25:16,980
<i>It's been around since</i>
<i>before you were born.</i>

246
00:25:17,048 --> 00:25:19,278
At least until last night.

247
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,114
What happened last night?

248
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:24,053
It was annihilated.

249
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:42,438
<i>Hey, Duncan, what's the matter?</i>

250
00:25:42,507 --> 00:25:43,496
<i>The British...</i>

251
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:45,167
<i>destroyed the clans, Connor.</i>

252
00:25:45,243 --> 00:25:47,006
<i>Scotland's finished.</i>

253
00:25:47,078 --> 00:25:50,104
<i>Scotland will always be Scotland,</i>

254
00:25:50,181 --> 00:25:52,081
and someday you'll go back.

255
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:53,583
You can bet on it.

256
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:54,584
How much?

257
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:55,677
Aw, come on.

258
00:25:55,754 --> 00:25:58,587
Does everything have
to be a wager with you?

259
00:25:58,657 --> 00:26:00,181
Well, you're the one
that keeps telling me...

260
00:26:00,258 --> 00:26:02,488
our lives are nothing
but a boundless game.

261
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:06,423
Good morning, gentlemen.

262
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:08,989
What seems to be
the problem here?

263
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:11,797
They refuses to pay her toll, sir.

264
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:13,633
<i>Really? How dare they.</i>

265
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:15,138
These men are rogues.

266
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:17,504
<i>These men are</i>
<i>liars and scoundrels, sir.</i>

267
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:20,477
They've done nothing but
prey upon us 3 years running,

268
00:26:20,545 --> 00:26:22,513
right at this very spot.

269
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:24,845
And by whose authority
do you act?

270
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,110
By Deed of the King.

271
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,118
<i>There is a little "X" down here.</i>

272
00:26:31,189 --> 00:26:34,317
<i>Does the King always</i>
<i>sign his name with an "X"?</i>

273
00:26:34,392 --> 00:26:35,859
Excuse me. Sorry. Ha ha.

274
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:37,417
I think these gentlemen
should be paid.

275
00:26:37,495 --> 00:26:38,985
That deed is a fake.

276
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:40,395
That's a matter of opinion.

277
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:42,524
You, sir, are
no better than they.

278
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:45,069
That is also a matter of opinion.

279
00:26:45,136 --> 00:26:46,160
Here you go.

280
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:49,335
Ladies.

281
00:26:49,407 --> 00:26:51,238
It's gold!

282
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:52,674
Why not--
It's gold.

283
00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:54,177
<i>First man: Ha ha!</i>

284
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:56,213
Hey, wait a minute.
They took my money!

285
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:57,680
Oh, it's here.

286
00:26:57,749 --> 00:26:59,216
They took my money!

287
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:00,546
<i>Let's go get 'em!</i>

288
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,109
Shall we?

289
00:27:03,521 --> 00:27:04,783
Aye.

290
00:27:05,857 --> 00:27:07,154
<i>Aah!</i>

291
00:27:10,495 --> 00:27:11,655
- Ooh.
- Ooh.

292
00:27:21,206 --> 00:27:22,537
Heh heh.

293
00:27:22,607 --> 00:27:23,539
<i>Not bad.</i>

294
00:27:23,608 --> 00:27:24,768
Uh-oh.

295
00:27:26,511 --> 00:27:27,603
Mmm.

296
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:31,912
All right boys, time to go.
Let's go!

297
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:32,915
<i>Come on!</i>

298
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:36,719
<i>Ohh. Cuckoo.</i>

299
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:38,756
Oh, looks heavy, huh?

300
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:40,552
<i>Looks like</i>
<i>you lost your edge, lad.</i>

301
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:41,557
<i>Really heavy.</i>

302
00:27:41,626 --> 00:27:43,150
Or could he be lass?

303
00:27:43,228 --> 00:27:44,559
Could be.

304
00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:45,561
Could be.

305
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:50,194
Hyah!

306
00:27:51,536 --> 00:27:52,468
<i>Come on!</i>

307
00:27:52,537 --> 00:27:54,971
<i>Hyah! Hyah!</i>

308
00:27:57,242 --> 00:27:58,174
Hyah!

309
00:29:50,822 --> 00:29:52,687
<i>Corporal Duncan MacLeod, sir.</i>

310
00:29:52,757 --> 00:29:55,317
<i>I've come to pick up</i>
<i>the wounded.</i>

311
00:30:33,064 --> 00:30:34,395
You've improved greatly.

312
00:30:34,465 --> 00:30:35,989
Ah, you really think so?

313
00:30:41,406 --> 00:30:42,338
No.

314
00:30:43,474 --> 00:30:44,873
I'm just being gracious.

315
00:30:44,943 --> 00:30:45,500
Hmm.

316
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,343
Now, remember.

317
00:30:49,414 --> 00:30:51,075
<i>You are only immortal...</i>

318
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:53,674
as long as you
can keep your head...

319
00:30:53,751 --> 00:30:54,911
on your shoulders.

320
00:30:58,556 --> 00:30:59,682
Gahh.

321
00:30:59,757 --> 00:31:03,386
Duncan, what you give up
to your adversary...

322
00:31:03,461 --> 00:31:05,520
in defeat...

323
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:06,655
is everything.

324
00:31:06,731 --> 00:31:08,824
I know.
And at that point,

325
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,800
I'm very, very dead.
Come on!

326
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:11,801
Heh heh heh.

327
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,338
Not just dead, Duncan--

328
00:31:14,405 --> 00:31:15,337
Empty!

329
00:31:18,142 --> 00:31:20,235
Aye, Connor, I know.
It's called the Quickening.

330
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:22,404
Our strength and knowledge,
our life essence,

331
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,107
flows into the victor, feeds him,

332
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:25,945
and makes him stronger, yes?

333
00:31:26,017 --> 00:31:28,178
It's what drives
the other Immortals...

334
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:29,220
to kill us,

335
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:30,777
<i>and what forces us...</i>

336
00:31:30,855 --> 00:31:32,447
to be smarter,
better than the rest.

337
00:31:32,523 --> 00:31:34,684
I understand.

338
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:37,556
Ooh.

339
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:40,930
You do?

340
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,428
Ohh.

341
00:31:43,501 --> 00:31:44,433
<i>Good.</i>

342
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:48,136
I slipped.

343
00:31:48,206 --> 00:31:51,198
Listen, soon you and I
will have to part.

344
00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:53,676
There is one more thing
I want to give to you.

345
00:31:57,715 --> 00:31:58,647
<i>Va via. Va via!</i>

346
00:31:58,716 --> 00:31:59,876
Ho ho ho.

347
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:01,145
Oh, aye!

348
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:04,677
Oh, aye. This is
much more to my liking.

349
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:05,688
Good.

350
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,349
Bah! Heh heh heh.

351
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:08,357
Heh heh heh.

352
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:10,689
Attack me.

353
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:13,788
But you've got your back to me.

354
00:32:14,966 --> 00:32:18,231
It's not always
about strength, Duncan.

355
00:32:18,303 --> 00:32:19,270
Attack me!

356
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:26,841
Aah!

357
00:32:26,911 --> 00:32:29,744
It's about manipulation
of the mind...

358
00:32:33,651 --> 00:32:35,243
as well as the body.

359
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:38,050
Aye, but now I'm in control.

360
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:40,454
Heh heh heh. Are you?

361
00:32:47,565 --> 00:32:50,693
Remember well, my friend.

362
00:32:50,768 --> 00:32:54,260
Properly executed,
this move is unstoppable.

363
00:32:55,606 --> 00:32:59,007
Properly executed,
we'll nae have this talk again.

364
00:33:22,433 --> 00:33:24,196
Who are you?

365
00:33:24,268 --> 00:33:26,930
A friend... or a lover.

366
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,030
Or a wife.

367
00:33:29,107 --> 00:33:30,199
Kate?

368
00:33:30,274 --> 00:33:31,798
<i>Attaboy.</i>

369
00:33:31,876 --> 00:33:34,868
Except I'm Faith now.

370
00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:37,471
Part of the makeover.

371
00:33:37,548 --> 00:33:39,140
What are you doing here?

372
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:41,947
Remember our wedding day,
Duncan?

373
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,453
<i>I do.</i>

374
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:47,657
The way we danced.

375
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:50,717
I felt like we were flying.

376
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:02,270
Of course,
we did come down...

377
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,272
didn't we?

378
00:34:06,677 --> 00:34:08,269
Crashing.

379
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:13,908
Oh, shit.

380
00:34:22,427 --> 00:34:25,760
<i>It's time to show</i>
<i>our Immortal brother...</i>

381
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:29,095
<i>a thing or two.</i>

382
00:34:38,376 --> 00:34:40,276
Somebody order
a club sandwich?

383
00:34:40,344 --> 00:34:42,778
He's funny.
Nice outfit, too.

384
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:45,577
Faith, I told you I look
like a fuckin' orange!

385
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:48,175
I'm not dressing you black, Bob.
Trust me.

386
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:49,150
Who are they?

387
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:52,519
Friends.

388
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,057
What, it's a team sport now?

389
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:55,615
<i>What, you didn't know?</i>

390
00:34:55,693 --> 00:34:59,026
It's a whole new ball game.

391
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,031
Aah!

392
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:19,640
Hey!

393
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:22,748
Nice bat.

394
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:35,998
Aargh!

395
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:37,591
Told you I was gonna cut you.

396
00:35:47,745 --> 00:35:49,110
Aaah!

397
00:35:56,254 --> 00:35:58,222
Let my man Jin Ke
deal with him.

398
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:03,225
Jin Ke...

399
00:36:03,294 --> 00:36:04,921
who served with
the Emperor Chin.

400
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:07,260
The same man.

401
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:09,356
Some people say
you're a man of honor.

402
00:36:09,433 --> 00:36:11,367
What do you know about honor?

403
00:36:13,271 --> 00:36:14,932
Oh, great.

404
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:17,467
Yaah!

405
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:04,316
Honor's not in a weapon.

406
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:05,650
It's in the man.

407
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:35,378
<i>Enough!</i>

408
00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:41,281
Boys, boys.

409
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:43,953
<i>I do apologize.</i>

410
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:46,553
<i>When it comes to discipline,</i>

411
00:37:46,631 --> 00:37:50,533
the first hundred years
are the hardest.

412
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:54,996
Ohh!

413
00:37:56,474 --> 00:37:57,406
Ohh!

414
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:01,575
Guess I'm not much
of a swords guy.

415
00:38:01,646 --> 00:38:06,208
I thought I told you to stop.

416
00:38:08,185 --> 00:38:09,152
<i>Yeah, well,</i>

417
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:10,482
I stopped.

418
00:38:10,554 --> 00:38:11,578
Tell me, Carlos.

419
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:14,124
How much is your life worth?

420
00:38:14,191 --> 00:38:16,659
Don't start this bullshit, man.

421
00:38:16,727 --> 00:38:19,457
<i>'Cause the only way</i>
<i>to win your freedom...</i>

422
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:21,225
is to kill me.

423
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:22,231
You're crazy.

424
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,392
Am I?

425
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:25,458
Then go ahead.

426
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:28,437
Stop the madness.

427
00:38:30,174 --> 00:38:33,405
Can you live with the fear?

428
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:36,275
Can you live
with the weakness?

429
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,782
Weakness, Carlos.

430
00:38:47,558 --> 00:38:49,287
I call this...

431
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:52,124
decap with a twist--

432
00:38:52,196 --> 00:38:53,424
No sugar.

433
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:41,602
Watchers?

434
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:42,941
Huh?

435
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:47,443
Watchers observe Immortals.

436
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:49,713
They're not supposed
to interfere.

437
00:39:49,787 --> 00:39:52,483
Unfortunately, our role
has changed somewhat.

438
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:53,921
Why?

439
00:39:53,991 --> 00:39:55,925
<i>Because the rules</i>
<i>have been broken.</i>

440
00:39:55,993 --> 00:39:59,929
One of your kind
has gone renegade.

441
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:05,328
In doing so, he's gained
himself a sizable advantage.

442
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:07,997
<i>One that'll be</i>
<i>impossible to overcome.</i>

443
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:09,403
Nobody's unbeatable.

444
00:40:09,473 --> 00:40:11,998
Oh, yes, Duncan. He is.

445
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:17,236
Unbeatable.

446
00:40:21,018 --> 00:40:22,280
No.

447
00:40:32,563 --> 00:40:33,495
Ahh.

448
00:40:34,565 --> 00:40:35,657
Sorry about that.

449
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:39,868
There must always be
two of your kind.

450
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:41,529
As long as there are two,

451
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:43,197
and you're kept from fighting,

452
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:45,139
then the prize is safe.

453
00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:48,235
The Sanctuary must not fail again.

454
00:40:48,312 --> 00:40:49,540
You're insane.

455
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:52,047
<i>Get yourself another volunteer.</i>

456
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:56,075
We had a number of volunteers!

457
00:40:56,153 --> 00:40:59,554
Sadly, that's
no longer the case.

458
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:01,147
You'll be warehoused,

459
00:41:01,225 --> 00:41:02,624
hidden away.

460
00:41:02,693 --> 00:41:03,921
Go to hell.

461
00:41:03,994 --> 00:41:05,188
Don't worry.

462
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:09,059
The drugs'll kick in momentarily.

463
00:41:48,405 --> 00:41:49,497
<i>Get up.</i>

464
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:51,766
<i>Get up!</i>

465
00:41:59,316 --> 00:42:02,285
You have better things to do
than lie there on your ass.

466
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:04,946
Who are you?

467
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:07,354
<i>Someone who knows</i>
<i>more about you...</i>

468
00:42:07,424 --> 00:42:09,119
than you know about yourself.

469
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:10,490
Are you a demon?

470
00:42:10,561 --> 00:42:12,586
<i>Heh, heh heh.</i>

471
00:42:12,663 --> 00:42:13,994
I've been called that...

472
00:42:14,064 --> 00:42:15,190
and worse.

473
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:19,632
I'm Connor MacLeod
of the Clan MacLeod.

474
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:21,466
Connor MacLeod?

475
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:24,531
And like you, my friend,

476
00:42:24,608 --> 00:42:26,633
I have a hard time dying.

477
00:42:42,993 --> 00:42:44,119
Dawson?

478
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:46,920
Heh, you look like shit.

479
00:42:46,997 --> 00:42:48,123
Thanks.

480
00:42:48,198 --> 00:42:49,665
How long have I--

481
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:50,597
We'll talk about it later.

482
00:42:50,668 --> 00:42:51,635
We gotta get outta here.

483
00:42:51,702 --> 00:42:54,637
Come on, can you walk?

484
00:42:54,705 --> 00:42:55,672
Yeah.

485
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:56,831
Uhh.

486
00:43:13,457 --> 00:43:15,823
<i>Go. Go!</i>

487
00:43:15,893 --> 00:43:17,224
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

488
00:43:17,294 --> 00:43:18,158
<i>Keeping tabs on you.</i>

489
00:43:18,228 --> 00:43:19,695
<i>Yeah?</i>

490
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:20,991
<i>Well...</i>

491
00:43:21,065 --> 00:43:22,327
someone should keep tabs...

492
00:43:22,399 --> 00:43:24,162
on that psychotic asshole
back there.

493
00:43:24,234 --> 00:43:25,826
Didn't you get it
back in London?

494
00:43:25,903 --> 00:43:28,201
<i>These guys don't play by the rules.</i>

495
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:30,001
You don't know what
you're up against, Mac.

496
00:43:30,074 --> 00:43:31,371
So people keep telling me.

497
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:32,739
Stop the car.

498
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:35,244
I managed to liberate that
from their lost and found.

499
00:43:35,312 --> 00:43:37,177
There's blood on it.

500
00:43:37,247 --> 00:43:39,112
I didn't say it was easy.

501
00:43:39,183 --> 00:43:40,115
Pull over.

502
00:43:40,184 --> 00:43:42,084
<i>What?</i>

503
00:43:42,152 --> 00:43:43,642
Pull over.

504
00:43:43,721 --> 00:43:46,349
<i>MacLeod, tell me something.</i>

505
00:43:46,423 --> 00:43:47,515
Mac, hear him out!

506
00:43:47,591 --> 00:43:50,082
Mac! Will you
tell me something?

507
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,594
<i>Now, how many Quickenings</i>
<i>have you had?</i>

508
00:43:55,165 --> 00:43:56,723
How many heads
have you taken?

509
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,791
I don't keep score.

510
00:43:59,436 --> 00:44:01,097
Well, we do.

511
00:44:08,512 --> 00:44:10,946
<i>MacLeod, Connor.</i>

512
00:44:11,015 --> 00:44:12,277
What's that?

513
00:44:12,349 --> 00:44:14,078
The Watchers' version
of a resumé.

514
00:44:17,621 --> 00:44:20,215
<i>It's a bit like</i>
<i>handicapping horses, I know,</i>

515
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:21,621
but it's part
of the gig, all right?

516
00:44:23,527 --> 00:44:27,463
<i>174 confirmed Immortal kills.</i>

517
00:44:30,467 --> 00:44:32,196
Sound about right?

518
00:44:32,269 --> 00:44:34,328
So, what's your point?

519
00:44:34,405 --> 00:44:37,203
Here's the gentleman
you met in Connor's loft.

520
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:44,541
<i>661 confirmed Immortal kills.</i>

521
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:51,010
Welcome to your worst nightmare.

522
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:53,386
<i>Sanctuary wasn't shit, pal.</i>

523
00:44:53,457 --> 00:44:56,119
This guy is way
out of your league.

524
00:45:00,764 --> 00:45:03,130
I want to see
Connor MacLeod's body.

525
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,998
Why?

526
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:07,401
Something
doesn't make sense.

527
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:10,333
What are you saying?

528
00:45:10,407 --> 00:45:14,002
I think he's saying
he wants to see the body.

529
00:45:14,078 --> 00:45:15,841
Well, it's gonna be a rough I.D.

530
00:45:15,913 --> 00:45:18,404
They're all missing their heads!

531
00:45:58,856 --> 00:46:01,188
We gave 'em
a Christian burial, MacLeod.

532
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:02,520
It was decent, you know.

533
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:04,254
Said all the right words.

534
00:46:04,328 --> 00:46:06,796
Can't begin to tell you
how reassuring that is.

535
00:46:06,864 --> 00:46:08,263
<i>With all these</i>
<i>unexplained corpses,</i>

536
00:46:08,332 --> 00:46:12,098
<i>well, we had to take it</i>
<i>off the beaten track.</i>

537
00:46:12,169 --> 00:46:13,761
End of the road, Joe.

538
00:46:16,507 --> 00:46:17,439
Thanks.

539
00:46:19,176 --> 00:46:21,644
You watch your ass, MacLeod.

540
00:46:21,712 --> 00:46:23,976
It's not my ass
I'm worried about.

541
00:46:27,818 --> 00:46:29,410
Did I happen to mention
about all this...

542
00:46:29,486 --> 00:46:30,680
coming to a bad end?

543
00:46:30,754 --> 00:46:32,847
No, Methos.

544
00:46:32,923 --> 00:46:34,515
I don't believe you did.

545
00:46:40,597 --> 00:46:41,996
You were gonna stay and dig.

546
00:46:42,065 --> 00:46:44,727
Dig? Oh, yeah!

547
00:47:09,226 --> 00:47:12,889
<i>I need to know</i>
<i>if he's still alive, Professor.</i>

548
00:47:12,963 --> 00:47:16,421
<i>I want to see</i>
<i>Connor MacLeod's body.</i>

549
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:20,527
<i>One of your kind</i>
<i>has gone renegade.</i>

550
00:47:25,709 --> 00:47:28,576
<i>People change, Duncan.</i>

551
00:47:28,645 --> 00:47:30,135
<i>You'll learn that.</i>

552
00:47:57,507 --> 00:47:58,701
No.

553
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:08,045
What are you doing here?

554
00:48:09,586 --> 00:48:12,384
You walked out
on your life, Connor.

555
00:48:12,456 --> 00:48:13,445
Why?

556
00:48:16,526 --> 00:48:18,255
I had my reasons.

557
00:48:18,328 --> 00:48:19,955
Reasons?

558
00:48:22,866 --> 00:48:25,300
Every life I touch ends...

559
00:48:26,503 --> 00:48:27,470
brutally...

560
00:48:28,605 --> 00:48:29,970
and for no reason.

561
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,632
<i>It's a curse...</i>

562
00:48:31,708 --> 00:48:34,006
<i>that's followed me for centuries.</i>

563
00:48:35,445 --> 00:48:39,905
I can't outrun it,
and I can't outlive it.

564
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:43,944
Rachel's death made you
the last soul on this planet...

565
00:48:44,021 --> 00:48:45,318
that means a damn to me.

566
00:48:45,389 --> 00:48:48,222
<i>I thought there was a way out.</i>

567
00:48:48,292 --> 00:48:49,316
The Sanctuary?

568
00:48:51,228 --> 00:48:52,160
Yes.

569
00:48:54,898 --> 00:48:56,388
The Sanctuary.

570
00:48:57,701 --> 00:48:58,827
So, how did you escape?

571
00:49:00,504 --> 00:49:02,131
I didn't escape.

572
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:05,400
<i>I was let go.</i>

573
00:49:08,845 --> 00:49:12,076
I couldn't see the slaughter,

574
00:49:12,149 --> 00:49:13,241
only heard it...

575
00:49:14,685 --> 00:49:15,617
and felt it.

576
00:49:48,352 --> 00:49:49,717
Jacob Kell.

577
00:50:01,164 --> 00:50:02,825
So, here we are--

578
00:50:02,899 --> 00:50:05,094
Both immortal.

579
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:07,500
<i>Missed the signs,</i>

580
00:50:07,571 --> 00:50:09,539
didn't we?

581
00:50:09,606 --> 00:50:13,201
But we were both
so new at the game.

582
00:50:16,279 --> 00:50:17,610
Connor.

583
00:50:18,949 --> 00:50:22,146
What a glorious sight.

584
00:50:23,954 --> 00:50:26,081
Just look, Connor.

585
00:50:27,924 --> 00:50:31,416
Look back at the endless
travesties of your life,

586
00:50:31,495 --> 00:50:33,053
and you'll see me,

587
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:35,826
always there
waiting in the shadows.

588
00:50:35,899 --> 00:50:37,696
<i>When friends and lovers...</i>

589
00:50:37,768 --> 00:50:39,395
<i>are wiped from your sight--</i>

590
00:50:40,504 --> 00:50:41,528
I'm there.

591
00:50:41,605 --> 00:50:43,334
<i>When those you cherish...</i>

592
00:50:43,407 --> 00:50:46,467
<i>die abruptly and for no reason--</i>

593
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:48,477
I'm there for you.

594
00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:50,978
And when your cellmates...

595
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:53,778
in their so-called Sanctuary...

596
00:50:53,850 --> 00:50:56,910
<i>are left twitching</i>
<i>like headless chickens--</i>

597
00:50:58,555 --> 00:50:59,487
Guess who?

598
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:05,695
<i>Connor.</i>

599
00:51:05,762 --> 00:51:08,094
<i>Stay out of it, Duncan.</i>

600
00:51:12,536 --> 00:51:14,936
Would you kill
an unarmed man...

601
00:51:15,005 --> 00:51:16,199
again, Connor?

602
00:51:17,507 --> 00:51:18,439
<i>Oh!</i>

603
00:51:18,508 --> 00:51:21,204
You didn't know, Duncan?

604
00:51:22,446 --> 00:51:25,313
<i>Because you didn't tell him.</i>

605
00:51:25,382 --> 00:51:27,577
Would that finally
put the agony...

606
00:51:27,651 --> 00:51:29,915
<i>in your soul to rest?</i>

607
00:51:29,986 --> 00:51:32,887
Then go ahead.

608
00:51:32,956 --> 00:51:35,584
Send me home.

609
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:38,218
What's stopping you?

610
00:51:38,295 --> 00:51:39,626
Honor?

611
00:51:40,697 --> 00:51:42,494
Guilt?

612
00:51:42,566 --> 00:51:44,830
The nagging sense that maybe you,

613
00:51:44,901 --> 00:51:46,232
more than I, deserve to die?

614
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:49,398
<i>Or somewhere along the way...</i>

615
00:51:49,473 --> 00:51:53,170
did you just lose your nerve?

616
00:51:53,243 --> 00:51:54,540
It's holy ground, Connor.

617
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:56,545
Ooh.

618
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:58,205
Yes.

619
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:00,909
Take your shot.

620
00:52:02,085 --> 00:52:03,712
What better chance than now?

621
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:05,914
Do it.

622
00:52:05,989 --> 00:52:10,892
Do it for your sweet mother.

623
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:13,259
Aah!

624
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:16,197
Or the sweet little war orphan...

625
00:52:16,266 --> 00:52:20,168
<i>Rachel Ellenstein...</i>

626
00:52:23,406 --> 00:52:24,668
who, if I'm not mistaken,

627
00:52:24,741 --> 00:52:27,335
you raised
as your own daughter.

628
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:29,571
Tell me, do they even begin...

629
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:32,046
to equal for the murder
of a man of God...

630
00:52:32,115 --> 00:52:34,276
who raised me as his own son?

631
00:52:34,351 --> 00:52:36,649
Aah!

632
00:52:38,421 --> 00:52:39,854
Slow...

633
00:52:39,923 --> 00:52:41,652
close--

634
00:52:42,726 --> 00:52:44,751
Feels good, doesn't it?

635
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:46,955
But look at you.

636
00:52:48,064 --> 00:52:51,033
Even now, you're afraid--

637
00:52:51,101 --> 00:52:52,864
Afraid you'll lose.

638
00:52:52,936 --> 00:52:54,961
That's your true fear, isn't it?

639
00:52:55,038 --> 00:52:57,632
The thought of giving up
your essence to me,

640
00:52:57,707 --> 00:53:01,438
making me
even stronger by it.

641
00:53:03,246 --> 00:53:05,043
What's wrong?

642
00:53:05,115 --> 00:53:08,744
Don't you want
to be inside me?

643
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:37,870
I want you to think back
to this moment, Connor!

644
00:53:44,321 --> 00:53:46,380
In the endless nights ahead!

645
00:53:46,456 --> 00:53:48,014
<i>Aah!</i>

646
00:54:01,838 --> 00:54:03,032
And know...

647
00:54:03,106 --> 00:54:04,505
Aah!

648
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:06,542
every time
you close your eyes...

649
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:10,102
from now to eternity,
I'll be there!

650
00:54:12,716 --> 00:54:16,345
Ripping apart the ones
you care about most!

651
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:17,909
Aah!

652
00:54:26,463 --> 00:54:30,297
It's never over,
Connor MacLeod.

653
00:54:30,367 --> 00:54:33,131
Living is what matters.

654
00:54:33,203 --> 00:54:36,331
And you will live with this.

655
00:54:36,406 --> 00:54:37,373
Count on it.

656
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,203
One far-off day,

657
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:41,744
you and I will be
the only two remaining.

658
00:54:41,811 --> 00:54:43,244
You will look back on this...

659
00:54:43,313 --> 00:54:47,272
and know you had
one chance to stop me.

660
00:54:47,350 --> 00:54:48,817
You failed.

661
00:54:48,885 --> 00:54:50,785
But until that day,

662
00:54:50,854 --> 00:54:52,879
I will take my vengeance...

663
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:54,981
on those you love.

664
00:54:55,058 --> 00:54:59,256
<i>Your living...</i>
<i>has been my prize.</i>

665
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:01,592
For old times' sake.

666
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:05,391
<i>He is your son.</i>

667
00:55:07,904 --> 00:55:12,671
You, on the other hand...

668
00:55:14,878 --> 00:55:18,575
are on borrowed time.

669
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:19,842
Call you.

670
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:26,519
Is what he said true?

671
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:31,961
Is it?

672
00:55:32,028 --> 00:55:33,655
Believe only what your heart...

673
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:35,925
and conscience tell you.

674
00:55:38,201 --> 00:55:39,862
Connor...

675
00:55:39,936 --> 00:55:42,029
with time, anything
can be forgiven.

676
00:55:42,105 --> 00:55:43,868
You taught me that.

677
00:55:49,245 --> 00:55:50,974
Did I?

678
00:56:19,843 --> 00:56:21,868
Oh, look at Dave. Dave!

679
00:56:21,945 --> 00:56:23,412
<i>Behave yourself, Duncan!</i>

680
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:25,345
<i>No more talking!</i>

681
00:56:25,415 --> 00:56:29,317
May all your hardships fade away.

682
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:31,684
<i>Till night becomes morn,</i>

683
00:56:31,755 --> 00:56:34,724
<i>let love remain</i>
<i>to guide your way.</i>

684
00:56:34,791 --> 00:56:36,850
Till the day we are reborn.

685
00:56:38,094 --> 00:56:39,994
Till the day we are reborn.

686
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:41,394
Kiss her, won't you?

687
00:56:50,273 --> 00:56:51,501
<i>Connor?</i>

688
00:56:53,209 --> 00:56:56,576
<i>I thought you'd never get here.</i>

689
00:56:56,646 --> 00:56:58,807
Connor!

690
00:57:01,985 --> 00:57:05,250
<i>You know</i>
<i>Kate is like us, immortal.</i>

691
00:57:05,321 --> 00:57:07,585
<i>Aye. I sensed something</i>
<i>the day we met,</i>

692
00:57:07,657 --> 00:57:09,181
but I wasn't sure.

693
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:12,251
Well, now you know.

694
00:57:12,328 --> 00:57:14,819
And you know as well as I do...

695
00:57:14,898 --> 00:57:18,698
that her Immortality
can only be triggered...

696
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:22,033
by the shock of a violent death.

697
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:24,164
Yes, I do.

698
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:25,229
And without such a death,

699
00:57:25,308 --> 00:57:26,707
she will simply
grow old and die.

700
00:57:26,776 --> 00:57:28,437
Yes, I know, Connor.

701
00:57:28,511 --> 00:57:31,071
Is that what you came
to tell me on my wedding day?

702
00:57:31,147 --> 00:57:33,638
Come on.
Drink up, man.

703
00:57:35,185 --> 00:57:37,346
No.

704
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:39,718
I was wondering.

705
00:57:41,224 --> 00:57:43,192
Does she know?

706
00:57:45,428 --> 00:57:46,360
Why?

707
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:54,797
Many years
after I was married,

708
00:57:57,173 --> 00:57:59,107
one night...

709
00:57:59,175 --> 00:58:01,643
I found Heather
in front of the house.

710
00:58:01,711 --> 00:58:05,169
<i>She had a knife in one hand...</i>

711
00:58:05,248 --> 00:58:07,148
<i>and her hair in the other.</i>

712
00:58:07,217 --> 00:58:08,343
<i>When I asked her...</i>

713
00:58:08,418 --> 00:58:10,750
<i>why she had done such</i>
<i>a thing to herself,</i>

714
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:13,311
she said it was
the one part of her...

715
00:58:13,389 --> 00:58:15,584
that would never age.

716
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:18,092
<i>It would forever</i>
<i>remain the same...</i>

717
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:20,686
<i>as when I first</i>
<i>fell in love with her.</i>

718
00:58:21,831 --> 00:58:24,561
That's how she wanted me
to remember her.

719
00:58:24,634 --> 00:58:27,398
Why are you telling me this?

720
00:58:27,470 --> 00:58:30,337
Because I once loved a woman...

721
00:58:30,406 --> 00:58:31,771
more than life itself--

722
00:58:35,545 --> 00:58:37,536
<i>and I watched her die.</i>

723
00:58:37,614 --> 00:58:42,950
<i>Unlike me, you have a choice.</i>

724
00:58:58,801 --> 00:59:01,099
What would you have me tell her?

725
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:03,468
I'd tell her nothing.

726
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:04,598
She wouldn't believe you anyway.

727
00:59:04,674 --> 00:59:06,164
Then I can do nothing.

728
00:59:06,242 --> 00:59:08,574
She's in the flower of her youth.

729
00:59:08,645 --> 00:59:11,443
Enjoy the moment,
and let it pass.

730
00:59:11,514 --> 00:59:13,812
And if it were you in my place?

731
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:15,908
I was in your place!

732
00:59:17,854 --> 00:59:20,448
But I thank God
I never had the choice.

733
00:59:20,523 --> 00:59:22,320
I love Kate,

734
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:24,519
and I will hold on to her
as long as I can.

735
00:59:24,594 --> 00:59:27,119
And that is all I can do!

736
00:59:32,302 --> 00:59:34,236
Forever, my love.

737
00:59:36,272 --> 00:59:37,967
Until the day we are reborn.

738
00:59:39,676 --> 00:59:40,973
Until the day we are reborn.

739
01:00:37,567 --> 01:00:39,501
You haven't lost your touch.

740
01:00:39,569 --> 01:00:40,900
What do you want?

741
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:41,902
To talk.

742
01:00:41,971 --> 01:00:43,063
Oh, that's a first.

743
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:44,333
I've tried to talk to you
a thousand times--

744
01:00:44,407 --> 01:00:46,272
Get to the point.

745
01:00:46,342 --> 01:00:47,536
I was wrong.

746
01:00:47,610 --> 01:00:48,975
<i>Oh, no, no.</i>

747
01:00:49,045 --> 01:00:50,569
Stealing's wrong.

748
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:52,774
Lying's wrong.
Killing's wrong.

749
01:00:52,849 --> 01:00:54,783
What you did
goes well beyond wrong.

750
01:00:54,851 --> 01:00:56,250
Fine.

751
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:58,116
I deserve that,

752
01:00:58,187 --> 01:00:59,620
but I want a chance
to make it right.

753
01:00:59,689 --> 01:01:01,623
You want to make it right?

754
01:01:01,691 --> 01:01:02,749
Then give me back the ability...

755
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:04,622
to have children,

756
01:01:04,694 --> 01:01:07,094
to grow old
with the man I love.

757
01:01:07,163 --> 01:01:09,393
How about anything that
resembles a normal life?

758
01:01:09,465 --> 01:01:11,729
And you took it all
away from me.

759
01:01:11,801 --> 01:01:12,927
Those things I can't give you.

760
01:01:13,002 --> 01:01:16,062
Oh, something else
you forgot to tell me.

761
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:18,565
Good-bye, Duncan.

762
01:01:18,641 --> 01:01:20,302
Kell can't give you
those things, either,

763
01:01:20,376 --> 01:01:24,176
so tell me, Kate, why him?

764
01:01:24,247 --> 01:01:25,805
Because I've never
known anybody...

765
01:01:25,882 --> 01:01:28,578
with such a capacity for hate--

766
01:01:28,651 --> 01:01:29,948
Except me.

767
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:33,250
That's what's kept you
going all these years?

768
01:01:33,322 --> 01:01:34,289
Hmm?

769
01:01:36,859 --> 01:01:37,848
Fine.

770
01:01:40,329 --> 01:01:41,387
Go home, Faith.

771
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:45,667
Take care of what's important.

772
01:03:07,984 --> 01:03:11,476
You were with him.

773
01:03:13,289 --> 01:03:15,655
A woman is a temple...

774
01:03:15,725 --> 01:03:19,354
built on a sewer.

775
01:03:21,597 --> 01:03:25,158
Remember what you were
when I first found you.

776
01:03:26,836 --> 01:03:29,327
A whore.

777
01:03:30,606 --> 01:03:33,507
Now, look at you.

778
01:03:33,576 --> 01:03:35,942
<i>A liberated whore.</i>

779
01:03:36,012 --> 01:03:37,206
Fuck you.

780
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:40,909
Oh, we'll get to that, blossom.

781
01:03:40,983 --> 01:03:43,042
But in the interim, be grateful...

782
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:46,748
I don't take
your pretty little face off.

783
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:49,986
Hurts, doesn't it...

784
01:03:51,427 --> 01:03:55,124
that there is something
you actually <i>can't</i> have?

785
01:03:56,465 --> 01:03:59,400
Hmm. I can <i>have...</i>

786
01:03:59,468 --> 01:04:01,936
anything I want.

787
01:04:03,472 --> 01:04:05,440
Except me.

788
01:04:08,611 --> 01:04:11,671
I've already <i>had</i> you.

789
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:18,449
Not really.

790
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:26,458
Close enough.

791
01:06:42,465 --> 01:06:43,659
Forever.

792
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:22,736
May love remain
to guide our way...

793
01:07:22,805 --> 01:07:24,636
till the day we are reborn.

794
01:07:29,845 --> 01:07:31,472
Forgive me.

795
01:07:33,149 --> 01:07:34,776
Uhh!

796
01:07:48,831 --> 01:07:51,391
I'm sorry.

797
01:07:53,102 --> 01:07:55,900
You had no right.

798
01:08:13,089 --> 01:08:14,681
Uhh!

799
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:19,455
<i>Kate?</i>

800
01:08:19,528 --> 01:08:21,018
<i>No. Don't be frightened.</i>

801
01:08:21,097 --> 01:08:22,291
<i>You're immortal.</i>
<i>We both are.</i>

802
01:08:22,364 --> 01:08:24,389
Aah!

803
01:08:24,467 --> 01:08:25,399
<i>Uhh!</i>

804
01:08:27,036 --> 01:08:30,062
I did it for you--

805
01:08:30,139 --> 01:08:31,128
For us.

806
01:08:31,207 --> 01:08:32,674
- Uhh!
- <i>Kate.</i>

807
01:08:32,741 --> 01:08:33,673
<i>Kate?</i>

808
01:08:33,742 --> 01:08:34,868
Oh, no!

809
01:08:34,944 --> 01:08:36,104
<i>Oh, no.</i>

810
01:08:36,178 --> 01:08:37,645
<i>Oh, my God.</i>
<i>What have I done?</i>

811
01:08:37,713 --> 01:08:39,305
Kate!

812
01:08:39,381 --> 01:08:41,679
<i>You wanted this.</i>

813
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:44,947
You forced it on me.

814
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:47,147
I never asked for eternity.

815
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:51,760
<i>I never wanted us to be apart.</i>

816
01:08:55,865 --> 01:08:57,196
Would you have really understood?

817
01:08:57,266 --> 01:08:58,597
<i>Which part?</i>

818
01:08:58,667 --> 01:09:02,159
The endless, numbing
sameness of it all?

819
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:04,536
<i>Or never bothering</i>
<i>to love someone...</i>

820
01:09:04,607 --> 01:09:07,838
because whole lifetimes
tick by so fast...

821
01:09:07,910 --> 01:09:09,172
they don't even count anymore?

822
01:09:12,014 --> 01:09:13,345
Then why did you come?

823
01:09:14,783 --> 01:09:18,241
To see if I could feel again--

824
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:20,151
Anything.

825
01:09:38,507 --> 01:09:40,600
You're missing the point, Kate.

826
01:09:40,676 --> 01:09:43,008
The difference
between Connor and I...

827
01:09:43,078 --> 01:09:44,477
is that as long
as you're still alive,

828
01:09:44,547 --> 01:09:46,447
there's a chance that one day...

829
01:09:46,515 --> 01:09:47,482
I might be forgiven.

830
01:09:47,550 --> 01:09:49,541
It may take years--

831
01:09:50,753 --> 01:09:52,220
Centuries, even.

832
01:09:53,656 --> 01:09:55,749
But at least I can
carry that hope inside me.

833
01:09:55,824 --> 01:09:58,384
That's one blessing
of immortality--

834
01:10:00,396 --> 01:10:02,387
There's always tomorrow.

835
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:06,060
Even for us.

836
01:10:24,553 --> 01:10:27,784
What are you doing, Jin?

837
01:10:27,856 --> 01:10:29,346
Just thinking.

838
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:32,587
<i>Men, for the most part,</i>

839
01:10:32,661 --> 01:10:34,128
can mend their ways...

840
01:10:34,196 --> 01:10:37,029
only after they have made
a mistake.

841
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:40,293
<i>One day soon,</i>

842
01:10:40,369 --> 01:10:42,360
we will all...

843
01:10:42,438 --> 01:10:44,906
serve very little purpose to Kell,

844
01:10:44,974 --> 01:10:46,635
except dead.

845
01:11:02,458 --> 01:11:03,755
<i>A toast.</i>

846
01:11:05,961 --> 01:11:07,861
I see tonight...

847
01:11:08,998 --> 01:11:11,933
as a celebration of the spirit.

848
01:11:13,535 --> 01:11:15,366
To all of you...

849
01:11:15,437 --> 01:11:17,337
who continue to stand by me--

850
01:11:17,406 --> 01:11:19,772
even those who might waver...

851
01:11:19,842 --> 01:11:21,639
<i>at times--</i>

852
01:11:22,978 --> 01:11:26,436
<i>You are my flock.</i>

853
01:11:27,783 --> 01:11:28,750
<i>You...</i>

854
01:11:28,817 --> 01:11:31,285
nourish my soul.

855
01:11:34,523 --> 01:11:36,855
You are all a part...

856
01:11:36,925 --> 01:11:39,189
of a great journey--

857
01:11:39,261 --> 01:11:42,162
a 400-year quest--

858
01:11:44,133 --> 01:11:45,566
for justice.

859
01:11:48,003 --> 01:11:51,564
<i>And here, my friends,</i>

860
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:54,734
is the instrument
of that justice--

861
01:11:56,512 --> 01:11:57,809
The giver...

862
01:11:57,880 --> 01:12:00,371
and taker of creation...

863
01:12:02,551 --> 01:12:05,384
baptized in blood.

864
01:12:08,524 --> 01:12:09,456
It is the living...

865
01:12:09,525 --> 01:12:11,823
that matters...

866
01:12:11,894 --> 01:12:13,327
after all.

867
01:12:18,133 --> 01:12:20,328
It sings like an angel.

868
01:12:21,804 --> 01:12:23,499
Just listen.

869
01:12:32,581 --> 01:12:34,014
<i>Uhh!</i>

870
01:12:40,222 --> 01:12:41,154
<i>Uhh!</i>

871
01:12:49,231 --> 01:12:50,789
<i>Uhh!</i>

872
01:13:04,213 --> 01:13:06,010
Till the day we are reborn.

873
01:13:17,259 --> 01:13:18,521
Ohh!

874
01:13:26,368 --> 01:13:28,996
Ohh!

875
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:33,405
Aah!

876
01:13:33,475 --> 01:13:35,466
Uhh!

877
01:14:03,071 --> 01:14:04,368
Kell.

878
01:14:05,707 --> 01:14:07,072
Jacob Kell.

879
01:14:15,784 --> 01:14:16,773
Connor?

880
01:14:29,865 --> 01:14:33,164
We've lived many lives,
you and I.

881
01:14:33,235 --> 01:14:34,862
We've seen things...

882
01:14:34,937 --> 01:14:38,464
that most people
could never understand.

883
01:14:38,540 --> 01:14:41,566
But now what do you see?

884
01:14:41,643 --> 01:14:44,407
I see someone who would
never kill an unarmed man.

885
01:14:45,914 --> 01:14:50,351
I also see someone
who has lost hope.

886
01:14:50,419 --> 01:14:52,853
Life brings hope and pain...

887
01:14:55,290 --> 01:14:58,259
but revenge
never brings redemption.

888
01:14:58,327 --> 01:15:01,262
The path and choice are ours.

889
01:15:08,537 --> 01:15:10,027
Connor, what the hell's going on?

890
01:15:10,105 --> 01:15:13,006
I have chosen mine.

891
01:15:13,075 --> 01:15:14,007
Aah!

892
01:15:14,076 --> 01:15:15,202
What are you doing?

893
01:15:15,277 --> 01:15:16,471
Kell's too strong,

894
01:15:16,545 --> 01:15:18,877
and he's getting stronger.

895
01:15:18,947 --> 01:15:21,006
Neither one of us can beat him alone.

896
01:15:22,618 --> 01:15:24,085
Are you out of your mind?

897
01:15:25,454 --> 01:15:27,615
Aah! If we let him win,

898
01:15:27,689 --> 01:15:29,122
it could mean the end.

899
01:15:35,030 --> 01:15:36,725
Connor, no!

900
01:15:38,433 --> 01:15:41,459
Kell is going
to kill you, Duncan,

901
01:15:41,537 --> 01:15:43,402
just to torment me,

902
01:15:43,472 --> 01:15:45,201
and there is nothing
you can do about it--

903
01:15:45,274 --> 01:15:46,400
<i>Nothing!</i>

904
01:15:46,475 --> 01:15:47,874
I don't believe that, Connor.
Neither should you.

905
01:15:47,943 --> 01:15:50,912
Alone, neither one of us
can beat him.

906
01:15:50,979 --> 01:15:52,003
Together, we can.

907
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:54,514
You know the rules.

908
01:15:54,583 --> 01:15:56,483
Only one Immortal
can challenge another.

909
01:15:57,786 --> 01:15:59,845
And only one will.

910
01:15:59,922 --> 01:16:01,048
This isn't the answer.

911
01:16:01,123 --> 01:16:03,489
Listen to me.

912
01:16:03,559 --> 01:16:04,583
In the end,

913
01:16:04,660 --> 01:16:06,753
there can be only one,

914
01:16:06,828 --> 01:16:08,386
and that has to be you.

915
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:12,467
No.

916
01:16:13,835 --> 01:16:14,995
We can beat him together.

917
01:16:15,070 --> 01:16:17,561
Then we are in agreement.

918
01:16:28,617 --> 01:16:29,549
Enough, Connor!

919
01:16:30,852 --> 01:16:31,876
I won't fight you.

920
01:16:31,954 --> 01:16:34,923
I will never fight you, Connor.

921
01:16:34,990 --> 01:16:36,958
Then you die!

922
01:16:49,004 --> 01:16:49,936
Uhh.

923
01:17:03,885 --> 01:17:07,321
No! You're not
doing this, Connor.

924
01:17:07,389 --> 01:17:09,823
Oh, yes, we're doing this.

925
01:17:09,891 --> 01:17:11,222
Every day,

926
01:17:11,293 --> 01:17:15,024
every breath we took
was for this end.

927
01:17:18,467 --> 01:17:21,868
Look inside
and tell me I'm wrong.

928
01:17:41,757 --> 01:17:43,349
Aah!

929
01:17:45,260 --> 01:17:47,558
Aah! Aah!

930
01:17:52,934 --> 01:17:54,401
Do it!

931
01:17:58,106 --> 01:17:59,573
I can't.

932
01:18:02,911 --> 01:18:05,209
Remember how
you first found me?

933
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:07,339
Sitting in that bloody bog,

934
01:18:07,416 --> 01:18:09,714
scared out of my mind?

935
01:18:09,785 --> 01:18:11,616
You taught me
how to live, Connor.

936
01:18:11,687 --> 01:18:12,915
You taught me <i>why</i> we live.

937
01:18:14,156 --> 01:18:17,091
Have you forgotten all of that?

938
01:18:18,527 --> 01:18:19,459
No.

939
01:18:21,863 --> 01:18:23,660
Our bonds...

940
01:18:23,732 --> 01:18:27,998
are all that hold us
in this world.

941
01:18:28,070 --> 01:18:30,004
Don't break this one.

942
01:18:34,409 --> 01:18:36,172
Please, Connor.

943
01:18:36,244 --> 01:18:37,677
I'm begging you.

944
01:18:42,317 --> 01:18:43,750
It's too late.

945
01:18:51,193 --> 01:18:53,661
This has to be done.

946
01:18:53,729 --> 01:18:55,060
Haah!

947
01:18:58,333 --> 01:18:59,459
No, Connor!
Not like this!

948
01:18:59,534 --> 01:19:00,967
Come on, stop!

949
01:19:01,036 --> 01:19:02,901
Connor, stop!

950
01:19:02,971 --> 01:19:03,835
Duncan!

951
01:19:08,210 --> 01:19:10,906
One of us has to die now,
old friend.

952
01:19:12,981 --> 01:19:13,913
No.

953
01:19:16,852 --> 01:19:18,581
And you know it.

954
01:19:20,722 --> 01:19:21,689
No.

955
01:19:25,527 --> 01:19:26,960
Good-bye, Duncan,

956
01:19:28,597 --> 01:19:30,064
my true brother.

957
01:19:33,401 --> 01:19:35,665
I love you, Connor.

958
01:19:44,846 --> 01:19:45,904
Aah!

959
01:19:48,617 --> 01:19:50,744
No!

960
01:19:57,793 --> 01:20:02,355
<i>Aah!</i>

961
01:22:26,875 --> 01:22:27,933
Duncan.

962
01:22:29,177 --> 01:22:30,974
Well done.

963
01:22:35,483 --> 01:22:38,543
I ever thought
you had him in you.

964
01:22:40,455 --> 01:22:44,221
What does it feel like
to kill a brother?

965
01:22:45,293 --> 01:22:47,056
Feels good,

966
01:22:47,128 --> 01:22:49,426
doesn't it?

967
01:22:49,497 --> 01:22:52,261
You'll never know, will you?

968
01:22:54,469 --> 01:22:57,905
Now you'll never have
Connor MacLeod's head.

969
01:22:59,174 --> 01:23:02,166
Are <i>you</i> going to run?

970
01:23:02,243 --> 01:23:04,973
Are <i>you</i> going to hide?

971
01:23:07,782 --> 01:23:09,147
Run?

972
01:23:09,217 --> 01:23:10,206
Uhh!

973
01:23:10,285 --> 01:23:11,650
Aah!

974
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:14,052
<i>Brother, come on!</i>

975
01:23:14,122 --> 01:23:16,352
Aah!

976
01:23:17,892 --> 01:23:20,224
Aah!

977
01:23:23,865 --> 01:23:27,164
- Aah!
- Aah!

978
01:23:52,594 --> 01:23:54,528
How bad do you
want it, Duncan?

979
01:23:57,432 --> 01:23:58,922
You'll pay!

980
01:24:23,958 --> 01:24:24,982
Ahh!

981
01:24:43,945 --> 01:24:47,346
Ohh!

982
01:24:57,058 --> 01:24:58,525
Duncan!

983
01:26:21,009 --> 01:26:24,274
Okay, Kell. Come on.
Let's do this.

984
01:26:35,790 --> 01:26:37,883
<i>Just watch.</i>

985
01:27:01,182 --> 01:27:04,015
Merry Christmas.

986
01:27:25,406 --> 01:27:27,374
A valiant effort, Duncan.

987
01:27:28,476 --> 01:27:30,341
Too bad.

988
01:27:30,411 --> 01:27:32,936
And this is
just the beginning.

989
01:27:33,014 --> 01:27:35,642
You see, when
you absorbed Connor's spirit,

990
01:27:35,717 --> 01:27:38,618
you inherited his curse.

991
01:27:38,686 --> 01:27:39,812
Revenge...

992
01:27:39,887 --> 01:27:41,445
is so sweet.

993
01:27:41,522 --> 01:27:44,252
I wonder who we'll start with?

994
01:27:50,898 --> 01:27:51,830
Oh, Kate.

995
01:27:55,203 --> 01:27:56,135
Forever.

996
01:27:57,672 --> 01:27:59,264
Oh, God.

997
01:28:01,009 --> 01:28:01,998
Kell!

998
01:28:03,878 --> 01:28:05,709
Jacob Kell!

999
01:28:08,049 --> 01:28:09,949
Revenge...

1000
01:28:10,018 --> 01:28:13,215
will never bring you redemption,

1001
01:28:13,288 --> 01:28:15,950
<i>so I'm going to do it for you.</i>

1002
01:28:17,659 --> 01:28:18,717
<i>Aah!</i>

1003
01:28:21,162 --> 01:28:23,824
Is that all you've got?

1004
01:28:32,974 --> 01:28:34,305
<i>Dunc,</i>

1005
01:28:34,375 --> 01:28:35,865
<i>I'd thought</i>
<i>I'd be home for dinner...</i>

1006
01:28:35,943 --> 01:28:38,411
an hour ago, but
this is very impressive.

1007
01:28:40,281 --> 01:28:41,646
Come on.

1008
01:28:41,716 --> 01:28:43,445
Come on.What are you
waiting for?

1009
01:28:43,518 --> 01:28:45,281
I'd be delighted.
Yaah!

1010
01:28:57,031 --> 01:28:58,862
Impressive...

1011
01:29:00,101 --> 01:29:01,159
isn't it?

1012
01:29:01,235 --> 01:29:02,725
Uhh!

1013
01:29:02,804 --> 01:29:03,793
Duncan!

1014
01:29:09,243 --> 01:29:13,407
You see at last your fate!

1015
01:29:13,481 --> 01:29:15,142
Yes!

1016
01:29:15,216 --> 01:29:16,581
Because this game is done!

1017
01:29:22,290 --> 01:29:23,985
Uhh!

1018
01:29:25,259 --> 01:29:26,692
Well, look on the bright side.

1019
01:29:26,761 --> 01:29:29,491
<i>At least</i>
<i>you went down swinging.</i>

1020
01:29:29,564 --> 01:29:30,792
Jacob Kell.

1021
01:29:32,967 --> 01:29:35,094
<i>Time for redemption.</i>

1022
01:29:38,172 --> 01:29:40,834
The game isn't over yet.

1023
01:29:42,310 --> 01:29:43,402
<i>What's the matter?</i>

1024
01:29:43,478 --> 01:29:46,914
Don't you want to be inside me?

1025
01:29:49,751 --> 01:29:50,911
<i>In the end--</i>

1026
01:29:50,985 --> 01:29:53,852
...there can be only one.

1027
01:30:04,832 --> 01:30:06,527
And you're not it.

1028
01:30:06,601 --> 01:30:08,262
Uhh!

1029
01:30:08,336 --> 01:30:09,826
Call ya.

1030
01:30:31,459 --> 01:30:35,452
No!

1031
01:30:40,268 --> 01:30:42,202
Aah!

1032
01:31:45,867 --> 01:31:48,802
Hope you found peace,
my friend.

1033
01:33:24,632 --> 01:33:26,793
So, why are you here?

1034
01:33:26,867 --> 01:33:29,097
You hoping you'd find me?

1035
01:33:31,806 --> 01:33:33,706
For whatever reason,
Kell made his choice.

1036
01:33:37,778 --> 01:33:40,406
So, um,

1037
01:33:40,481 --> 01:33:42,142
what now?

1038
01:33:44,986 --> 01:33:47,352
Trust.

1039
01:33:47,421 --> 01:33:49,855
You can always trust me, Faith.

1040
01:33:49,924 --> 01:33:52,256
Faith is dead.

1041
01:33:52,326 --> 01:33:55,659
I thought we'd give
Kate another chance.

1042
01:34:06,440 --> 01:34:09,273
Not yet.

1043
01:34:09,343 --> 01:34:11,106
<i>Till the day we are reborn.</i>

1044
01:34:11,178 --> 01:34:13,840
You hold onto it for me.

1045
01:34:13,914 --> 01:34:15,779
We've got plenty of time.
