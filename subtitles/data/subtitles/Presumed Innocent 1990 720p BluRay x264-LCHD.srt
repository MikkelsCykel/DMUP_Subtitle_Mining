1
00:00:18,058 --> 00:00:19,726
I am a prosecutor.

2
00:00:20,602 --> 00:00:23,522
I'm a part of the business of accusing...

3
00:00:24,481 --> 00:00:25,732
...judging...

4
00:00:26,274 --> 00:00:27,692
...and punishing.

5
00:00:29,027 --> 00:00:31,446
I explore the evidence of a crime...

6
00:00:32,405 --> 00:00:34,741
...and determine who is charged...

7
00:00:35,951 --> 00:00:37,994
...who is brought to this room...

8
00:00:38,078 --> 00:00:40,288
...to be tried before his peers.

9
00:00:42,457 --> 00:00:44,960
I present my evidence to thejury...

10
00:00:45,961 --> 00:00:48,088
...and they deliberate upon it.

11
00:00:48,922 --> 00:00:51,800
They must determine
what really happened.

12
00:00:54,302 --> 00:00:55,929
If they cannot...

13
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:01,434
...we won't know if the accused deserves
to be freed or to be punished.

14
00:01:03,061 --> 00:01:05,272
If they cannot find the truth...

15
00:01:06,273 --> 00:01:08,441
...what is our hope ofjustice?

16
00:02:43,828 --> 00:02:45,288
Where's Nat?

17
00:02:45,914 --> 00:02:47,707
Burying a goldfish.

18
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:52,087
That he forgot to feed.
Kid's gotta learn responsibility.

19
00:02:52,504 --> 00:02:53,880
He's nine.

20
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:57,092
When you were nine,
you fed the animals on the block...

21
00:02:57,175 --> 00:02:59,386
...and made dinner,
did everyone's homework...

22
00:02:59,469 --> 00:03:01,972
...and, in your spare time,
you practiced law.

23
00:03:02,055 --> 00:03:04,808
I didn't practice law until I was ten.

24
00:03:05,559 --> 00:03:06,977
Listen to this.

25
00:03:07,227 --> 00:03:10,897
"ln their first face-to-face debate,
Nico Della Guardia...

26
00:03:11,273 --> 00:03:13,733
"...appeared to throw
Raymond Horgan off stride...

27
00:03:13,817 --> 00:03:16,778
"...with an opening swipe
at the prosecuting attorney's...

28
00:03:16,862 --> 00:03:20,949
"...twelve-year tenure as
'an uninterrupted retreat from reality...

29
00:03:21,366 --> 00:03:26,162
"'...and slow-motion surrender to thugs,
punks and hand-wringing liberals."'

30
00:03:26,538 --> 00:03:28,373
The guy's unbelievable.

31
00:03:28,874 --> 00:03:33,044
I'm finally starting to get used to that rug
on Della Guardia's head.

32
00:03:33,712 --> 00:03:35,797
Don't eat standing up. Sit down.

33
00:03:35,881 --> 00:03:39,050
Food goes down easier.
It has the help of gravity.

34
00:03:39,301 --> 00:03:40,594
Oh, God.

35
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,513
Yet another lawyer.

36
00:03:51,563 --> 00:03:54,733
I won't be home till late.
I got a game after school.

37
00:03:57,444 --> 00:04:00,322
Like his father, he doesn't come home
till he has to.

38
00:04:00,405 --> 00:04:03,575
If Raymond loses this election,
I could be home a lot.

39
00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:48,286
Rick, I looked this over last night.

40
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:50,455
Top count, max.

41
00:04:50,539 --> 00:04:52,207
It's a first offense!

42
00:04:52,457 --> 00:04:55,043
No plea to anything
but the A-1 felony. Period.

43
00:04:55,126 --> 00:04:56,419
On all of them?

44
00:04:56,545 --> 00:04:57,712
All of them.

45
00:04:57,796 --> 00:05:00,215
And no promises on the sentence.

46
00:05:03,051 --> 00:05:04,970
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

47
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:09,057
This is for you.

48
00:05:10,475 --> 00:05:12,644
Someone put it under the door last night.

49
00:05:12,727 --> 00:05:14,646
I found it when I came in.

50
00:05:18,692 --> 00:05:21,069
Mr. Big Cheese wants to see you now.

51
00:05:21,152 --> 00:05:22,487
I'll be right along.

52
00:05:22,571 --> 00:05:24,364
He said "now," now.

53
00:05:47,971 --> 00:05:49,347
What's wrong?

54
00:05:50,473 --> 00:05:53,018
Carolyn Polhemus was murdered last night.

55
00:05:54,352 --> 00:05:56,521
Her cleaning lady found the body
this morning.

56
00:05:56,605 --> 00:05:59,441
Some creep got into her place
and strangled her.

57
00:05:59,524 --> 00:06:02,652
It looks like she was raped.
He tied her up...

58
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,781
...he beat her with some instrument
and strangled her.

59
00:06:07,032 --> 00:06:09,659
No weapon. No sign of forced entry.

60
00:06:11,119 --> 00:06:13,955
Unless you want me here,
I'm supposed to meet the coroner.

61
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:16,666
That's all right. Go on, get out of here.

62
00:06:17,501 --> 00:06:19,252
I can hear Della Guardia now.

63
00:06:19,336 --> 00:06:23,882
"lf Raymond Horgan can't protect his own
attorneys, how can he protect citizens?"

64
00:06:24,716 --> 00:06:27,886
Tommy Molto's secretary said
he wasn't coming in today.

65
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,849
Some fucking Acting Head of Homicide
he turned out to be, the little creep.

66
00:06:32,933 --> 00:06:35,936
I should have fired him when we fired Nico.

67
00:06:36,561 --> 00:06:38,563
If I had balls, I'd do it now.

68
00:06:39,731 --> 00:06:42,317
I want you to handle this case personally.

69
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,402
I will assign it to somebody.

70
00:06:44,486 --> 00:06:46,530
Who will you assign it to? Homicide?

71
00:06:46,613 --> 00:06:48,782
Tommy Molto? For Christ's sake!

72
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:53,495
Della Guardia would love that.
Molto would tip him off on everything.

73
00:06:53,578 --> 00:06:58,250
They're so close you can see Molto's nose
sticking out of Nico's bellybutton.

74
00:07:02,796 --> 00:07:04,130
Listen to me.

75
00:07:06,591 --> 00:07:07,968
What a waste.

76
00:07:09,427 --> 00:07:11,930
Beautiful, sexy gal. Hell of a lawyer.

77
00:07:14,182 --> 00:07:16,768
That's her ending. That's her au revoir.

78
00:07:17,936 --> 00:07:19,896
The first thing we got to think about...

79
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:23,400
...is what the public thinks
in the middle of an election.

80
00:07:28,238 --> 00:07:30,866
Take charge of this one for me, okay?

81
00:07:31,658 --> 00:07:33,618
If you care about my health.

82
00:07:34,953 --> 00:07:37,455
You're the only around here I can trust.

83
00:07:39,124 --> 00:07:43,670
Greer's a good investigator, but I'd prefer
someone I'm used to working with.

84
00:07:43,962 --> 00:07:45,255
Lipranzer.

85
00:07:45,422 --> 00:07:46,882
Whatever you want.

86
00:07:48,008 --> 00:07:49,968
Just catch me a bad guy.

87
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:08,338
So, I'm here.

88
00:09:11,174 --> 00:09:13,802
What the hell was she doing with a B file?

89
00:09:14,302 --> 00:09:17,889
Bribery of elected officials.
The case number is on her computer.

90
00:09:17,973 --> 00:09:21,184
But the case itself isn't among
the papers in her files.

91
00:09:21,351 --> 00:09:23,270
Why? Did she take it home? What?

92
00:09:23,353 --> 00:09:24,896
Maybe it was taken?

93
00:09:25,063 --> 00:09:26,982
Check the apartment.
What do you got here?

94
00:09:27,065 --> 00:09:29,109
Bunch of pictures of a dead lady.

95
00:09:29,192 --> 00:09:31,111
-No weapon found, yet?
-Nada.

96
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:32,696
It's a weird one.

97
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:35,740
She was strangled by the ropes
but by the way he tied her...

98
00:09:35,824 --> 00:09:38,660
...it's like he put himself
between her legs and pumped...

99
00:09:38,743 --> 00:09:43,290
...so they tightened up like he was trying
to let his weight strangle her.

100
00:09:43,498 --> 00:09:45,709
Like he was trying to fuck her to death.

101
00:09:45,792 --> 00:09:47,377
Look at the next one.

102
00:09:54,134 --> 00:09:58,763
Check the computer for sex offenders
and cross match on Carolyn's name...

103
00:09:59,306 --> 00:10:01,474
...or this business with the ropes.

104
00:10:03,393 --> 00:10:06,646
Find out which of the creeps she put away
is out on parole.

105
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:11,401
I never did understand why you put her
in charge of rape and all that sicko shit.

106
00:10:12,402 --> 00:10:14,905
She wanted it. And she was good.

107
00:10:15,572 --> 00:10:17,407
Yeah, too good, maybe.

108
00:10:18,575 --> 00:10:20,410
I'm not grabbing this, yet.

109
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:23,121
You worked with this broad.

110
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:26,875
She wouldn't leave her fucking door
and windows wide open.

111
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:31,171
She was drinking with him. She gave him
a glass of beer, like she was entertaining.

112
00:10:31,254 --> 00:10:33,173
-Fingerprints on the glass?
-Yeah.

113
00:10:33,256 --> 00:10:35,175
Greer sent it down to the lab.

114
00:10:35,258 --> 00:10:39,763
You mean somebody she let in opened
the windows so it looked like a break-in?

115
00:10:40,096 --> 00:10:44,100
She wasn't going to let some sex maniac
she sent to jail in for a beer.

116
00:10:46,144 --> 00:10:48,688
On the other hand, we're talking Carolyn.

117
00:10:49,898 --> 00:10:50,899
Mac...

118
00:10:51,316 --> 00:10:54,945
...tell me what Carolyn Polhemus
was doing with a bribery file.

119
00:10:55,862 --> 00:10:59,074
I had no idea Carolyn was interested
in crimes above the waist.

120
00:10:59,157 --> 00:11:02,786
It's on her computer,
but not on mine or the department's.

121
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:04,538
That makes no sense.

122
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,832
Why don't you ask Raymond?

123
00:11:07,582 --> 00:11:09,334
Ready for something else?

124
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,212
Molto's left.

125
00:11:12,754 --> 00:11:16,466
His secretary came back from lunch
and found his desk cleaned out.

126
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:10,937
Exercise?

127
00:12:12,397 --> 00:12:13,899
Masturbation.

128
00:12:15,275 --> 00:12:17,444
The refuge of the lonely housewife.

129
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:22,657
Missed the 8:35. I tried to call,
but you weren't here.

130
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:25,952
Nat had dinner at Josh's,
and I was at the university.

131
00:12:26,077 --> 00:12:29,289
I tried to get in a little extra time
on the mainframe.

132
00:12:30,373 --> 00:12:31,791
Get anything done?

133
00:12:34,252 --> 00:12:35,378
Who am I kidding?

134
00:12:35,462 --> 00:12:38,632
Still working on my dissertation at my age.
It's ridiculous.

135
00:12:38,715 --> 00:12:41,384
You were the best mathematician
in your class.

136
00:12:41,885 --> 00:12:44,888
Second best just made
full professor at MIT.

137
00:12:46,181 --> 00:12:47,474
All I've made are beds.

138
00:12:47,557 --> 00:12:49,684
And now, the Channel Six local news.

139
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:54,606
Carolyn Polhemus, assistant prosecuting
attorney in Raymond Horgan's office...

140
00:12:54,898 --> 00:12:57,776
...was found brutally murdered
in her Southside apartment.

141
00:12:57,859 --> 00:13:01,821
Police are about to release a statement
about the circumstances of her death....

142
00:13:01,905 --> 00:13:03,031
You hear?

143
00:13:03,114 --> 00:13:06,576
Eugenia was thrilled to be messenger
of bad tidings.

144
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:10,247
Yeah, I'll bet.

145
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:14,793
From top to bottom
we are riddled with cruelty.

146
00:13:15,001 --> 00:13:17,295
We must expose and punish it...

147
00:13:17,462 --> 00:13:21,550
...especially when inflicted
upon the impotent and the ignored.

148
00:13:23,468 --> 00:13:25,846
You sound like a woman with a mission.

149
00:13:26,596 --> 00:13:27,639
I am.

150
00:13:28,932 --> 00:13:30,934
The murder of Ms. Polhemus--

151
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:34,604
You have a suspect?

152
00:13:34,938 --> 00:13:36,773
We have diddly-shit.

153
00:13:41,611 --> 00:13:45,991
So Dan Lipranzer and Rusty Sabich
will work night and day for two weeks...

154
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:49,035
...to catch Raymond a killer.
That's the strategy.

155
00:13:50,036 --> 00:13:52,455
You're in charge of this investigation?

156
00:13:53,665 --> 00:13:56,001
Raymond insisted I take it on.

157
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:02,632
With 1 50 lawyers, they couldn't find one
who didn't fuck her to put in charge?

158
00:14:05,969 --> 00:14:07,512
Did you tell Raymond?

159
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:11,224
This is a conflict of interest.
Is that professional?

160
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:16,313
Barbara, I'm Raymond's chief deputy.

161
00:14:16,646 --> 00:14:18,648
You are so predictable.

162
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:23,320
It's your way of reliving the whole thing.

163
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:26,323
She's dead and you're still obsessing.

164
00:14:38,001 --> 00:14:39,002
Rusty.

165
00:14:40,003 --> 00:14:41,046
Nico.

166
00:14:41,588 --> 00:14:43,256
She was just....

167
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:46,843
-Splendid.
-That's it. Very good.

168
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:50,597
Raymond's pressing hard
on that case, I imagine.

169
00:14:51,264 --> 00:14:53,850
Raymond presses hard on every case, Nico.

170
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:57,229
You know who would've been hard
to beat? You.

171
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:00,524
You would've been tough. Very tough.

172
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:04,194
You are really something.
Where's Tommy Molto?

173
00:15:04,861 --> 00:15:05,695
Molto?

174
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:08,823
I thought he'd come to the funeral
of his favorite colleague.

175
00:15:08,907 --> 00:15:11,159
You must really have him scrambling.

176
00:15:16,331 --> 00:15:17,541
Judge.

177
00:15:23,171 --> 00:15:24,840
Who's that with Raymond?

178
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:27,300
I'm told that's her ex-husband.

179
00:15:29,636 --> 00:15:31,471
I didn't know she had one.

180
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:35,684
Teaches college someplace.

181
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:38,144
Carolyn Polhemus worked for me.

182
00:15:39,479 --> 00:15:40,689
I hired her...

183
00:15:41,022 --> 00:15:42,941
...over the objections of...

184
00:15:43,483 --> 00:15:47,279
...many of our prosecutors
who felt shejust didn't have the stuff.

185
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,991
I see those prosecutors here today...

186
00:15:52,659 --> 00:15:54,995
...along with thejudges she defied...

187
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:58,832
...and the defense attorneys she defeated.

188
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:02,836
Why are they all here?

189
00:16:04,671 --> 00:16:08,008
They're here because Carolyn Polhemus
stood for something.

190
00:16:09,676 --> 00:16:11,595
She stood forjustice.

191
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:31,239
The Prosecutor's Office,
under my leadership...

192
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:33,533
...has a conviction rate of over 91 percent.

193
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:35,660
Mr. Della Guardia, or...

194
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:40,373
...as he is known to those of us
who have had to work with him, "Delay"--

195
00:16:40,707 --> 00:16:42,584
There's food here for 1 00 people.

196
00:16:42,667 --> 00:16:44,127
A lot of no-shows.

197
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:46,546
They smell a loser.

198
00:16:47,797 --> 00:16:50,967
-Good speech.
-What the hell is happening with Carolyn?

199
00:16:51,718 --> 00:16:53,178
Everything's in the works.

200
00:16:53,261 --> 00:16:57,015
I reassigned her cases, and this afternoon
I gotta deal with Molto's stuff.

201
00:16:57,098 --> 00:16:59,267
What's with this reassignment shit?

202
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:00,852
Goddamn it, Rusty!

203
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:04,189
I told you to give this investigation
top priority.

204
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:09,152
Nico is eating me alive with this thing.
The election is in ten days.

205
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:12,072
If you don't find Carolyn's killer,
we are both history.

206
00:17:12,155 --> 00:17:15,408
Turn all of that administrative bullshit
to Mac.

207
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:17,786
Mac has more than she can handle.

208
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:21,039
And let me remind you,
we lost two key PA's in one day.

209
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:24,709
You only have time for the election.
I've got to run the office.

210
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:27,921
Fuck the office!
Don't you see what's happening?

211
00:17:28,046 --> 00:17:31,383
If you don't find me a killer,
there is no fucking office!

212
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:35,595
I want you right on top
of Carolyn's case, understand?

213
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:40,016
Run out every ground ball and do it
in an orderly goddamned fashion!

214
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:44,646
Start acting like a fucking professional!

215
00:17:44,771 --> 00:17:47,232
The campaign is a total disaster.

216
00:17:47,732 --> 00:17:51,403
Haven't taken a poll in two weeks.
We don't know where the hell we are.

217
00:17:51,486 --> 00:17:54,656
You're ten minutes late
for the bar meeting on criminal procedure.

218
00:17:54,739 --> 00:17:57,242
Call them and tell them I'm on my way.

219
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,916
Did you assign a bribery case to Carolyn?

220
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:07,002
There's a file missing.

221
00:18:07,502 --> 00:18:10,922
Loretta, find my driver.
Tell him to be ready to leave.

222
00:18:11,047 --> 00:18:14,092
She had a case on her computer
we can't account for.

223
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,595
It was logged in as a B file.

224
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,933
Nobody knows where it came from.

225
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:25,437
Nobody knows where it went.

226
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,815
Where the hell is my speech?
It was right here on my desk.

227
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:30,275
Cody has it.

228
00:18:30,525 --> 00:18:32,527
You're giving me a runaround.

229
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:36,781
Cody, pull the car around.
I'll meet you down in front.

230
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:40,202
Give me a straight answer, will you, Boss?

231
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:54,299
There's the B file, Tiger.
Read it, and we'll talk.

232
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:58,720
"Dear Mr. Horgan.

233
00:18:58,803 --> 00:19:02,807
"This is about a deputy prosecuting
attorney who is taking bribes.

234
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:06,269
"Five years ago,
a person I'll call 'Noel' got arrested.

235
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:09,147
"l gave him $1 ,500 to pay somebody off.

236
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:14,152
"We went out to North Branch.
A secretary who seemed to know Noel...

237
00:19:14,277 --> 00:19:19,157
"...took him into the PA's office, where
a man he could not see talked behind him.

238
00:19:19,824 --> 00:19:23,829
"Ten days later, Noel went to court
and a lawyer from the PA's office...

239
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:27,123
"...told the judge that
the case was dismissed.

240
00:19:27,415 --> 00:19:30,335
"l can't remember the lawyer's name.
I hope you get him.

241
00:19:30,418 --> 00:19:33,588
"l hope you get Noel, too.
He has let me down."

242
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:36,091
-Unsigned.
-Unsigned.

243
00:19:37,175 --> 00:19:38,760
Five years ago.

244
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:41,054
That guy must write real slow.

245
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,473
"Noel equals Leon."

246
00:19:45,016 --> 00:19:47,018
This is Carolyn's handwriting.

247
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:50,188
Looks like she went to North Branch
to see Kenneally.

248
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:01,825
You'll love what I got from Painless.

249
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,498
There's this guy's semen
inside her vagina...

250
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:10,250
...but there's nothing outside.

251
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:14,337
Painless figures she didn't spend
much time on her feet after sex.

252
00:20:14,629 --> 00:20:17,465
He says, normally,
he'd see the guy's little thingies...

253
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:20,927
...swimming upstream in the womb,
when he looked under the microscope.

254
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:23,513
Instead, this guy's was all dead.

255
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:26,183
Nothing went nowhere.

256
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:28,476
So Painless figures he's sterile.

257
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:30,937
He's got blood type A.

258
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:33,523
My very own.

259
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:36,693
I thought of that. But you got a kid.

260
00:20:39,362 --> 00:20:40,697
Anything from hair or fiber?

261
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,782
No hair or skin fragments under her nails.

262
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:44,743
Carolyn would've fought back.

263
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:47,454
Maybe she was playing sex games
with the wrong guy.

264
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:50,957
The rope is K-Mart, Sears, Walgreen's.
You name it.

265
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:54,878
They found carpet fibers
from some other location. Zorak V.

266
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:57,172
It's only the biggest seller.

267
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:01,218
You call the Fingerprint Lab
on the bar glass?

268
00:21:02,385 --> 00:21:03,595
Oh, I forgot.

269
00:21:03,678 --> 00:21:06,097
You are a class-A fuck-up, you know?

270
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:08,558
They ain't going to expedite it for me.

271
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:11,978
I got the phone company printout
on her apartment.

272
00:21:14,689 --> 00:21:19,402
I notice that one of the numbers
that comes up is yours a number of times.

273
00:21:19,694 --> 00:21:21,738
At the office.
We were working cases together.

274
00:21:21,821 --> 00:21:23,740
No, she's calling your home.

275
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:29,538
She never called me at home.

276
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:41,299
I made these calls...

277
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:44,427
...to Barbara from Carolyn's apartment.

278
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:47,389
"Late again, kid."

279
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:51,434
"This trial's a bitch.
I'll catch dinner in town."

280
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,109
I'd just as soon you'd let it go.

281
00:22:01,444 --> 00:22:05,615
If Barbara sees a phone company
subpoena, now, she'll bust a gut.

282
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,956
Under the circumstances,
if you don't mind...

283
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:15,542
...l'd appreciate it.

284
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:20,630
I gave Barbara...

285
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,302
...enough pain.

286
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:31,474
Polhemus was bad news.

287
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:36,396
Know what they're calling you
and your partner downtown?

288
00:22:36,479 --> 00:22:37,480
Spare me.

289
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:39,441
"Mission lmpossible."

290
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:42,611
Guerasch, bring that shit in my office.

291
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:47,407
So you're figuring what? The guy
she was having cocktails with did her?

292
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:51,495
I figure it was somebody who knew
what he wanted it to look like.

293
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,747
Cop. PA. A private dick.

294
00:22:54,372 --> 00:22:57,542
Remember that lady PA
who was here four months ago?

295
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:59,169
Yeah, nice set of lungs.

296
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:02,422
This kid's gonna make a copper.
Never forgets a bra size.

297
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:04,508
He wants to know
what she was looking for.

298
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:07,511
She was looking for someone
by the name of Noel.

299
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:12,140
It took me a week to find this crap.

300
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:15,101
Five years back,
they booked 1 50 a day then.

301
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:16,603
Public indecency.

302
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:19,022
They were cleaning out the faggots.

303
00:23:19,105 --> 00:23:22,234
Back when Raymond got some balls
for a day and a half.

304
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:25,862
-She find anything?
-I don't know.

305
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:29,699
When I gave these files to her,
they were in nice order.

306
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:32,327
The bitch just trashed them.

307
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:35,413
She never gave a shit
about anybody else's work.

308
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:37,624
One's completely missing. Look.

309
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:40,210
See right here? It skips a number.

310
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:43,296
Tommy Molto been looking at these?

311
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,507
What does Molto have to do with this?

312
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,926
Would there still be a court file
on this case?

313
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:51,555
That far back, it'd have to be in storage
on microfilm by now.

314
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:59,396
You don't want to say
what this is about, maybe?

315
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:01,231
Gee, Lionel, I can't.

316
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:04,317
She used to ask about you, you know.

317
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:08,154
Five, six years ago when she worked
out here as a probation officer.

318
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:10,866
-Five years ago I didn't know her.
-Sure you did.

319
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:13,326
The night you brought the Night Saints in.

320
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,954
You were hot stuff. A regular fucking hero.

321
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:18,373
Breaking the meanest guy
this side of Watts.

322
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:21,501
There was a lot of talk
you'd end up in Horgan's job.

323
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:23,920
She wanted to know what you were like.

324
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:26,756
I told her you didn't fuck around.

325
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:30,260
Dad, look who's here.

326
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:34,890
-How are you?
-Good. Mom's in a good mood.

327
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,850
How'd you know I'd be on this ferry?

328
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:38,476
Took a chance.

329
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:41,605
How was your day?

330
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:45,775
Well, I figured out today,
it's ten years this week...

331
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:48,778
...that I'm working on my dissertation.

332
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:52,282
I thought we'd celebrate.
Going to take us to dinner?

333
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:56,703
Why don't you just give up
on that dissertation?

334
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:58,580
It makes you miserable.

335
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:01,208
Your mom's not a giver-upper.

336
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:03,376
Maybe that's her problem.

337
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,795
I sure wouldn't do math unless I had to.

338
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:08,215
You got my genes in the math department.

339
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:10,967
If not for your mom,
I'd still be taking algebra.

340
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:13,053
I had to be good at something.

341
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:15,222
You were good at everything.

342
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:17,224
School.

343
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:20,727
Did you ever cheat?

344
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:23,188
Like borrow someone else's homework?

345
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:25,690
Copy it and pretend it was mine?

346
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:31,613
Why do I have the feeling that question
has some personal relevance?

347
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:33,406
I didn't say I did.

348
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:35,283
It's all right, kid.

349
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:39,996
It's good to see you guys happy.

350
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:48,630
Pretty.

351
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,258
It's new.

352
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:54,302
It's very pretty.

353
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,941
Mr. Polhemus? I'm Rusty Sabich.

354
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:55,113
Seems so strange to be talking about her
after all these years.

355
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:58,533
You hadn't had much contact
with her, then?

356
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,494
None since she left.

357
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:02,954
What about her family?

358
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:05,624
I have no idea where she came from.

359
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:10,504
She lied her way into the university.
Made up some kind of background.

360
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:14,382
She was very good at playing roles.

361
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:19,429
When she left me, I lost all pride.

362
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:21,723
I begged her not to leave.

363
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:26,019
The last time she looked at me,
it was with disgust.

364
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:29,898
Disgust that somebody she'd looked up to
could be so weak.

365
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:34,903
At that moment, I had the most
desperate wish that she were dead.

366
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:42,410
Maybe she made a man feel like that
who actually acted on his fantasy.

367
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:48,041
Would you like to see what she looked like
at that time?

368
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,420
Yes, I would.

369
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:57,676
They were taken at about the time
we were married.

370
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:14,818
This isn't just work?

371
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:18,530
No.

372
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:43,471
On the Polhemus thing, what the fuck
is happening to the fingerprints report?

373
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:47,809
Don't give me that computer crap!
You know I don't understand that shit.

374
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:51,229
They want to know how big a field
you want it run against?

375
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:52,898
We could do convicted felons...

376
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:56,067
...anybody ever fingerprinted,
county employees, etc.

377
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:59,571
Just do felons.
We'll do the rest if we need them.

378
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:02,199
Do them all. I may never get back on.

379
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:04,326
Do everybody. How soon?

380
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,245
What the fuck takes a week?

381
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:09,831
The man has the biggest murder case
in the city...

382
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:12,000
...and he has to kiss your ring?

383
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,503
I know. I know.

384
00:29:16,338 --> 00:29:19,341
We don't have jurisdiction
over the computer.

385
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:25,430
-A week. Probably ten days.
-I need them yesterday.

386
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:28,975
I'll push, but I don't think
you'll see them any sooner.

387
00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:32,729
Have your copper get the glass back
from Evidence and down to the lab...

388
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:34,940
...in case they need it for anything.

389
00:29:37,526 --> 00:29:39,110
Ah, Mr. Sabich.

390
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:41,780
Real important stuff.

391
00:29:42,072 --> 00:29:44,491
We got the chief deputy with us.

392
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:47,369
Lipranzer and I were wondering,
on your report...

393
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:51,957
...are you indicating the guy bashed her
after she was strangled by the ropes?

394
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:53,500
Read the fucking report.

395
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:54,793
This report?

396
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:58,004
No, not that report. My report.
The autopsy.

397
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:03,844
See anything with bruises on the wrists...

398
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:06,930
...bruises on the ankles,
bruises on the knees?

399
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:09,975
Are you saying she was raped
and then tied up?

400
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,893
Tied up last, yeah.

401
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:14,938
She already died
from multiple head injuries.

402
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:17,482
Rape? Now I'm thinking...

403
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:19,359
...no.

404
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:20,569
Why?

405
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:23,071
Read the fucking report.

406
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:24,573
-This report?
-No.

407
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,659
This report? The chemist's report?

408
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:29,578
Yeah, the chemist's report.

409
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:33,582
She had a two percent solution
of nonoxynol-9 in her vagina.

410
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:37,752
A spermicide used with a diaphragm.
That's why his sperms were dead.

411
00:30:37,878 --> 00:30:40,922
Diaphragm? You missed a diaphragm
in the autopsy?

412
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:45,218
No. You've been to autopsies.
You slice her wide open.

413
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,637
No diaphragm in that lady.

414
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,514
What happened to it?

415
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:51,516
Somebody took it.

416
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:55,645
I think it's a setup.

417
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:57,606
This man...

418
00:30:57,939 --> 00:31:00,859
...is her lover. He comes over.
They have drinks.

419
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:04,779
This lady has intercourse with him.
Real nice. Okay?

420
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:08,783
But he's an angry guy.
Picks up something, kills her.

421
00:31:08,909 --> 00:31:11,203
Tries to make it look like rape.

422
00:31:11,328 --> 00:31:12,662
Ties her up.

423
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:14,623
Pulls out the diaphragm.

424
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:17,250
That's what I think.

425
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:21,713
What does Tommy Molto think?

426
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:28,887
You got his phone number right there.
Want to jot it down in case you need it?

427
00:31:29,763 --> 00:31:31,223
Next time you talk to him...

428
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:33,266
...tell him to call me so I can find out...

429
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:36,353
...what's going on
in my own fucking investigation.

430
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:38,897
Painless...

431
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:41,858
...you tell Molto, and you tell Nico, too...

432
00:31:41,942 --> 00:31:44,611
...that this is cheap, cheap politics.

433
00:31:44,778 --> 00:31:46,905
Cheap Police Department bullshit.

434
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:51,284
God better help them and help you, too.
I can't make a case for tampering.

435
00:31:51,952 --> 00:31:56,414
Our poll shows Della Guardia's leading
Horgan by four percent. Eight days left.

436
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,000
At least it's made somebody happy.

437
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:01,002
I don't want to see you out of here.

438
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:02,963
Come on, pal. We're old news.

439
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:07,259
I'd miss you. Who else here can talk
morality and ethics and not break me up?

440
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:12,097
Voters smell an exhausted man who's lost
sight of all the important issues.

441
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:13,974
Issues? Bullshit.

442
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:17,477
The only issue is Raymond Horgan
has respect for the law...

443
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:21,898
...and Nico Della Guardia will fuck the law
for politics. That's the issue.

444
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:26,236
Rusty....

445
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:29,406
Have you ever been to an lrish wake?

446
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:33,493
Come on over and pull up a glass.

447
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:37,497
Know what Della Guardia
is going to find out?

448
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:40,000
You run for office because...

449
00:32:40,834 --> 00:32:44,296
...you think you can make people do things,
make things better.

450
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:45,630
But you can't.

451
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,090
Nobody can.

452
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:51,720
You get a few potholes filled,
keep the lid on the best way you can.

453
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,138
But in the end...

454
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:56,474
...all you can do is try to hang on
to the fucking job.

455
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:03,315
I never used to drink when I started here.

456
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:06,985
Then, you still believed
you could make a difference.

457
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:11,698
Funny, part of me still does.

458
00:33:14,201 --> 00:33:16,328
A guy as tough as you are...

459
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:20,207
...you're still hanging on
to the shreds of your ideals.

460
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:22,709
The shreds are all I got.

461
00:33:24,878 --> 00:33:26,713
You're a good man, Rusty.

462
00:33:29,216 --> 00:33:30,550
God bless you.

463
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:36,556
So, tell me, who's our bad guy?

464
00:33:37,891 --> 00:33:40,727
It could be a boyfriend.
Some guy she picked up.

465
00:33:42,896 --> 00:33:46,858
Whoever it is knew enough about her
to know what to make it look like.

466
00:33:47,234 --> 00:33:49,653
Could be a law-enforcement type.

467
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,323
Jesus.

468
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:54,741
One of us.

469
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:07,879
You and Carolyn have a thing?

470
00:34:08,255 --> 00:34:12,175
Don't beat around the bush.
Just come right out and ask the question.

471
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:19,850
I'll say that the decedent and I
were both single and both adults.

472
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:23,103
I had a thing with her.

473
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:26,273
She thought like everybody else thought...

474
00:34:26,356 --> 00:34:28,608
...that I wasn't going to run again.

475
00:34:28,942 --> 00:34:32,571
That I could just hand the mantle over
to anyone I chose...

476
00:34:34,656 --> 00:34:36,491
...so why not a broad?

477
00:34:36,825 --> 00:34:38,076
Why not her?

478
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:41,454
One more question?

479
00:34:41,538 --> 00:34:44,541
I gave her the B file
because she asked me for it.

480
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:49,045
Because I was fucking her.

481
00:34:50,881 --> 00:34:52,048
Stupid, huh?

482
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,094
She went over to Northside...

483
00:34:57,846 --> 00:35:00,182
...shoveled through the records.

484
00:35:01,391 --> 00:35:03,310
There wasn't anything there.

485
00:35:06,313 --> 00:35:08,481
At least that's what she told me.

486
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:13,528
What are you going to do now?

487
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,822
Once the party's over?

488
00:35:16,323 --> 00:35:17,532
I don't know.

489
00:35:18,158 --> 00:35:19,701
I got an idea.

490
00:35:21,161 --> 00:35:23,580
Suppose we try to get you on the bench.

491
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:27,667
I should still have enough clout
to pull that off. What do you say?

492
00:35:28,335 --> 00:35:30,962
Why don't we just see
what the future holds.

493
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:38,011
Would that have satisfied her?

494
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:39,471
What's that?

495
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:40,680
A judgeship.

496
00:35:40,764 --> 00:35:44,226
I wonder if a judgeship
would've satisfied Carolyn Polhemus.

497
00:35:59,783 --> 00:36:00,784
Rusty!

498
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:04,162
Come say hello to Carolyn Polhemus.
Have you met?

499
00:36:04,913 --> 00:36:06,373
I've seen Rusty.

500
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:10,043
I want to bring Carolyn on board
as a prosecuting attorney.

501
00:36:10,252 --> 00:36:14,840
She's been working probation, Northside,
and she just passed her bar exam.

502
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:17,008
Congratulations.

503
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:18,260
Thank you.

504
00:36:18,385 --> 00:36:20,929
She comes very highly recommended.

505
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:24,975
Why don't we see if we can find
a nice place for her.

506
00:36:25,058 --> 00:36:27,060
I'd like the lndex Division.

507
00:36:27,394 --> 00:36:29,896
That's not a job, it's a jail sentence.

508
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:32,691
Rape, sex crimes, child molestation.

509
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:35,277
We can do better than that.

510
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:39,656
It's hard to get a conviction on a rape.
It's a dead-end for someone ambitious.

511
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:43,410
So you get the worst attorneys
trying the hardest cases?

512
00:36:44,578 --> 00:36:48,081
Listen to this. We got another idealist
in the office.

513
00:36:57,424 --> 00:36:59,259
He's five years old.

514
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:03,263
The doctors found 23 healed fractures
from old wounds.

515
00:37:05,432 --> 00:37:07,601
Victim of his own beloved mother.

516
00:37:09,102 --> 00:37:10,604
I need your help.

517
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:12,939
Your wife called.

518
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:18,195
Why don't you fire her?

519
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:21,406
Civil service. They're here forever.

520
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:25,035
Why don't you give this to Nancy.
You haven't had experience with kids.

521
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:26,953
Nancy's not available.

522
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:30,248
And, besides,
I'd like to try this case myself.

523
00:37:32,459 --> 00:37:33,793
With your help.

524
00:37:34,544 --> 00:37:36,213
Outline it for me.

525
00:37:37,297 --> 00:37:38,757
About a month ago...

526
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:42,219
...the mother brought him
into the West End Pavilion Hospital.

527
00:37:42,302 --> 00:37:45,138
The boy was unconscious
from severe head injuries.

528
00:37:45,222 --> 00:37:46,890
She said he fell.

529
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:48,433
The doctor says...

530
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:52,562
...the head wounds were too symmetrical
to be the result of a fall.

531
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:54,481
He told me...

532
00:37:54,648 --> 00:37:58,652
...he was treating a child whose mother
had crushed his head in a vise.

533
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:03,073
We have any proof it was the mother?
You got the vise?

534
00:38:03,156 --> 00:38:05,408
Just the testimony of the child.

535
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:09,788
When he sees the mother in
the courtroom, he'll recant. An iffy case.

536
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:13,375
I've examined him several times and...

537
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:15,710
...l think he's begun to trust me.

538
00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:19,714
Look, how many child abuse cases
does this office handle in a year?

539
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,091
Over a thousand.

540
00:38:21,174 --> 00:38:23,176
Every one of them terrible.

541
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:25,679
Every one of them heartbreaking.

542
00:38:25,762 --> 00:38:29,057
But I can't stop everything else
to take care of one case.

543
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:32,269
You're going to have to get somebody else
to help you.

544
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:34,938
You don't like me, do you?

545
00:38:36,773 --> 00:38:39,359
I think you've turned out to be
a damn good prosecutor.

546
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:44,072
You're angry I didn't have to go
through the channels like everyone else.

547
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:47,659
Clearly, you're not like everyone else.

548
00:38:47,784 --> 00:38:52,164
You think I got this job because
I fucked some fat-cat friend of Raymond's.

549
00:38:55,792 --> 00:38:57,252
Look, it's late....

550
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:02,841
Come on, I'll drive you to your ferry.

551
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:08,471
This is not the way to the ferry.

552
00:39:08,889 --> 00:39:10,724
I want you to meet somebody.

553
00:39:10,807 --> 00:39:13,018
Wendell, this is Rusty Sabich.

554
00:39:15,812 --> 00:39:18,523
He's a very important man in our office.

555
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:21,693
He's going to help me
when we go to court.

556
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:25,030
Remember what I told you about court?

557
00:39:25,322 --> 00:39:26,406
Yeah.

558
00:39:27,157 --> 00:39:28,658
Now, tell me.

559
00:39:29,743 --> 00:39:32,037
There's a judge and some nice people.

560
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,997
They're called a jury.

561
00:39:34,414 --> 00:39:36,791
And you're gonna ask me questions.

562
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:38,585
About what?

563
00:39:42,214 --> 00:39:44,007
About what happened.

564
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:45,550
When?

565
00:39:46,259 --> 00:39:47,761
When I got hurt.

566
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:50,180
What else did I tell you?

567
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:54,059
You said that if I told what Mommy did...

568
00:39:54,768 --> 00:39:58,021
...the judge and the nice people
will protect me...

569
00:39:58,271 --> 00:40:00,857
...and Mommy wouldn't hurt me anymore.

570
00:40:01,608 --> 00:40:03,568
Do you think you can do that?

571
00:40:03,652 --> 00:40:05,862
Answer my questions in court?

572
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:08,865
And tell what Mommy did to you?

573
00:40:11,868 --> 00:40:13,537
I think you can.

574
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:15,705
Mommy will be there.

575
00:40:16,706 --> 00:40:19,793
She can't hurt you.
She can't even talk to you.

576
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:22,462
You'll be completely safe.

577
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:26,383
You promise?

578
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:29,553
I promise.

579
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:40,021
His father got to him last night.

580
00:40:40,105 --> 00:40:43,275
Told him God would put him in hell
if he testified against his mother.

581
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:44,442
He's terrified.

582
00:40:44,526 --> 00:40:47,904
If you're not ready, we'll ask the judge
for a couple more days.

583
00:40:47,988 --> 00:40:48,989
No.

584
00:40:49,114 --> 00:40:51,783
We've got to do it now
or we'll lose him for good.

585
00:40:51,867 --> 00:40:55,203
Your mommy took you to the hospital
because you were hurt.

586
00:40:55,745 --> 00:40:57,706
What part of you was hurt?

587
00:40:58,373 --> 00:40:59,541
My head.

588
00:41:00,542 --> 00:41:02,210
How was it hurt?

589
00:41:06,673 --> 00:41:09,217
Wendell, how did you hurt your head?

590
00:41:12,721 --> 00:41:14,389
I don't remember.

591
00:41:18,727 --> 00:41:20,729
Have you ever seen this?

592
00:41:21,271 --> 00:41:22,230
Yes.

593
00:41:22,314 --> 00:41:23,523
Where?

594
00:41:23,899 --> 00:41:25,692
-In the cellar.
-At home?

595
00:41:25,901 --> 00:41:26,902
Yes.

596
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:29,571
Did somebody put your head inside it?

597
00:41:31,114 --> 00:41:32,365
Wendell?

598
00:41:34,451 --> 00:41:38,079
What did you say when somebody
put your head in the vise?

599
00:41:39,414 --> 00:41:43,335
You told me you screamed
when your head was put in the vise.

600
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:45,879
Remember?

601
00:41:46,505 --> 00:41:47,756
You told me.

602
00:41:50,842 --> 00:41:52,219
"l promise...

603
00:41:52,385 --> 00:41:53,970
"...l'll be a good boy.

604
00:41:54,054 --> 00:41:55,764
"l'll be a good boy."

605
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:58,517
Did somebody answer?

606
00:42:00,769 --> 00:42:01,978
Mommy.

607
00:42:02,229 --> 00:42:05,440
Mommy said I was a bad boy
and I deserved to die.

608
00:42:06,066 --> 00:42:08,109
And then what did Mommy do?

609
00:42:08,819 --> 00:42:11,071
She made it tighter and tighter.

610
00:42:11,154 --> 00:42:12,614
On your head?

611
00:42:12,823 --> 00:42:15,617
She hurt my head.
My mommy hurt my head.

612
00:42:17,786 --> 00:42:19,871
No further questions, Your Honor.

613
00:42:19,955 --> 00:42:22,082
The doctors have told us...

614
00:42:22,332 --> 00:42:23,959
...that the wounds...

615
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:27,337
...that Wendell suffered
could not have come from a fall...

616
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,965
...as the defense would have you believe.

617
00:42:30,924 --> 00:42:34,803
The police told us they found a vise
at the home of the defendant.

618
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,931
Medical experts have testified...

619
00:42:38,098 --> 00:42:41,518
...that the size and the shape
of the jaws of that vise...

620
00:42:41,643 --> 00:42:46,606
...exactly match the size and the shape
of the wounds to the little boy's head.

621
00:42:47,023 --> 00:42:49,317
And this evidence is clear...

622
00:42:49,818 --> 00:42:51,486
...and uncontested.

623
00:42:53,363 --> 00:42:56,199
But the most compelling evidence
in this trial...

624
00:42:56,283 --> 00:42:59,077
...comes not from doctors,
or police officers...

625
00:42:59,286 --> 00:43:01,496
...or other expert witnesses.

626
00:43:01,663 --> 00:43:03,832
The most damning testimony...

627
00:43:04,291 --> 00:43:07,252
...comes from an abused
and frightened child...

628
00:43:07,544 --> 00:43:10,422
...who overcame his fear and his pain...

629
00:43:11,131 --> 00:43:13,717
...to tell you, in his own words...

630
00:43:14,509 --> 00:43:16,511
...what really happened.

631
00:43:17,762 --> 00:43:22,017
If you're to remember nothing else
as you begin your deliberations...

632
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,102
...remember Wendell's words:

633
00:43:24,978 --> 00:43:27,022
"My mommy hurt my head."

634
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:30,734
"My mommy hurt my head."

635
00:43:35,155 --> 00:43:37,199
"My mommy hurt my head."

636
00:44:15,654 --> 00:44:17,239
Congratulations.

637
00:44:23,245 --> 00:44:25,163
It's gonna be so good.

638
00:47:02,028 --> 00:47:04,197
You're still in love with her.

639
00:47:08,326 --> 00:47:10,036
It was never love.

640
00:47:11,204 --> 00:47:12,873
What was it, then?

641
00:47:19,504 --> 00:47:21,214
It was never love.

642
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:26,887
What did she have
to make you feel so much?

643
00:47:39,232 --> 00:47:41,067
Ladies and gentlemen...

644
00:47:41,485 --> 00:47:43,236
...Raymond Horgan.

645
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,795
Thank you. Thank you.

646
00:48:02,923 --> 00:48:05,050
I wanted to come down
and say a few words...

647
00:48:05,133 --> 00:48:09,429
...before I call Mr. Della Guardia
and congratulate him on his victory.

648
00:48:10,514 --> 00:48:12,098
No, no, no. Come on.

649
00:48:13,475 --> 00:48:17,270
Of all the wonderful things
that have happened to me in 12 years...

650
00:48:18,063 --> 00:48:19,940
...the best has been...

651
00:48:20,649 --> 00:48:23,276
...knowing and working with all ofyou.

652
00:48:24,236 --> 00:48:26,822
Wait till you hear what's going down.
It's strange.

653
00:48:26,905 --> 00:48:30,075
Someone's fucked up over at the Hall.
It's way wrong.

654
00:48:30,158 --> 00:48:31,868
-Why?
-I get a message.

655
00:48:31,952 --> 00:48:36,039
I'm supposed to be in the chief's office
8:00 tomorrow to be interviewed.

656
00:48:36,122 --> 00:48:37,123
By Molto.

657
00:48:37,207 --> 00:48:39,167
No discussion. Interview.

658
00:48:39,251 --> 00:48:40,836
It's like they're after me, right?

659
00:48:40,919 --> 00:48:43,213
Another thing. When I came back tonight...

660
00:48:43,296 --> 00:48:46,800
...they took all the receipts
of the evidence I inventoried on Polhemus.

661
00:48:46,883 --> 00:48:48,635
No questions asked.

662
00:48:49,177 --> 00:48:50,679
Sounds like you're off the case.

663
00:48:50,762 --> 00:48:53,139
Sure. Fine, but figure this in.

664
00:48:53,265 --> 00:48:57,185
I'm at the North Branch before 5:00,
going through the microfilm.

665
00:48:57,811 --> 00:49:00,188
All of this hits by 6:00, 6:30.

666
00:49:01,064 --> 00:49:03,984
Look what I picked up
while I was out there.

667
00:49:04,192 --> 00:49:06,403
The case number matches
the complaint number...

668
00:49:06,486 --> 00:49:08,905
...that was missing
when you saw Kenneally.

669
00:49:08,989 --> 00:49:10,991
Five years ago. Bingo.

670
00:49:11,616 --> 00:49:14,661
And look who's listed
as Leon's probation officer.

671
00:49:17,164 --> 00:49:18,248
"Carolyn Polhemus."

672
00:49:18,331 --> 00:49:20,333
Wait. Here's the best.

673
00:49:21,293 --> 00:49:24,212
Who do you think was the deputy
handling the case?

674
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:28,175
Tommy Molto.

675
00:49:28,717 --> 00:49:32,929
You keep this because I don't know
what the fuck is happening with me.

676
00:49:39,936 --> 00:49:41,354
Tommy Molto.

677
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:45,901
Tommy Molto once worked here,
but we think he might be dead.

678
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:48,445
Raymond's inside.

679
00:49:48,528 --> 00:49:50,363
We've been waiting for you.

680
00:49:58,622 --> 00:49:59,664
Rusty.

681
00:50:01,291 --> 00:50:02,959
Molto and Delay...

682
00:50:04,711 --> 00:50:07,714
...have questions about
the Polhemus investigation.

683
00:50:08,548 --> 00:50:10,884
This should not be handled this way.

684
00:50:11,301 --> 00:50:13,470
You should speak with Rusty alone.

685
00:50:14,638 --> 00:50:15,472
What's this about?

686
00:50:15,555 --> 00:50:18,850
You were at Carolyn's apartment
the night she was killed.

687
00:50:18,975 --> 00:50:20,227
Bullshit.

688
00:50:26,191 --> 00:50:28,401
What was it, a Tuesday night?

689
00:50:30,737 --> 00:50:33,573
Barbara was at the university.
I was babysitting.

690
00:50:33,657 --> 00:50:35,784
Keep your fucking mouth shut.

691
00:50:35,909 --> 00:50:38,078
We got the fingerprint results...

692
00:50:38,161 --> 00:50:40,705
...the ones that you could never remember
to ask for.

693
00:50:40,789 --> 00:50:43,291
They're your prints all over the bar glass.

694
00:50:43,375 --> 00:50:45,377
Yours, Rozat K. Sabich.

695
00:50:46,127 --> 00:50:48,922
Five feet from where the woman
was found dead.

696
00:50:49,422 --> 00:50:53,260
Or maybe you didn't remember
that all county employees get printed.

697
00:50:57,764 --> 00:50:59,266
This is absurd.

698
00:50:59,891 --> 00:51:02,936
The phone records
you told Lipranzer not to get?

699
00:51:03,061 --> 00:51:05,313
We had the phone company
pull them this morning.

700
00:51:05,397 --> 00:51:07,357
You were calling her all month.

701
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:10,443
There's a call from your house
to hers that night.

702
00:51:16,199 --> 00:51:18,118
My God, you're serious.

703
00:51:22,205 --> 00:51:23,957
Tommy, for Christ's sake!

704
00:51:24,166 --> 00:51:25,208
Sabich.

705
00:51:25,959 --> 00:51:28,086
I want you to know one thing. I know.

706
00:51:28,170 --> 00:51:29,087
Sure you do.

707
00:51:29,171 --> 00:51:31,298
Go ahead, play cool. I know.

708
00:51:31,423 --> 00:51:33,758
You killed her. You're the guy.

709
00:51:34,759 --> 00:51:35,760
Oh, yeah?

710
00:51:35,844 --> 00:51:38,763
Yeah, you're right. You're always right.

711
00:51:45,645 --> 00:51:48,815
They think I killed her.
They're going to charge me.

712
00:51:49,691 --> 00:51:52,819
Don't be seen with me, man.
They'll fucking bury you.

713
00:51:55,989 --> 00:51:58,783
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

714
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:02,162
Are you sick?

715
00:52:05,749 --> 00:52:09,169
Nico and Molto are charging me
with Carolyn's murder.

716
00:52:11,963 --> 00:52:15,592
They found my fingerprints
on a glass of beer in her apartment.

717
00:52:19,596 --> 00:52:21,097
What does this mean?

718
00:52:21,223 --> 00:52:23,266
Grand jury investigation.

719
00:52:24,643 --> 00:52:28,438
They will or they won't indict me.
If they do, there'll be a trial.

720
00:52:31,316 --> 00:52:33,527
It's not going to go that far.

721
00:52:36,696 --> 00:52:38,865
I'm going to need a lawyer.

722
00:52:41,201 --> 00:52:43,870
A very, very good lawyer.
Expensive lawyer.

723
00:52:47,707 --> 00:52:49,876
It could break us financially.

724
00:52:51,169 --> 00:52:53,213
We can mortgage the house.

725
00:52:54,214 --> 00:52:56,049
Or sell it if we have to.

726
00:52:59,302 --> 00:53:01,221
What time does Nat get home?

727
00:53:02,889 --> 00:53:03,932
Nat?

728
00:53:06,893 --> 00:53:08,103
Oh, Rusty!

729
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:24,703
A lot ofpeople think Raymond
shouldn't run again.

730
00:53:25,537 --> 00:53:30,542
If he agrees to step aside, the party
will let him decide who will take his place.

731
00:53:32,544 --> 00:53:35,005
They know he won't hand it all to Nico.

732
00:53:35,088 --> 00:53:36,548
That's for sure.

733
00:53:38,216 --> 00:53:39,885
Who would he choose?

734
00:53:41,761 --> 00:53:43,513
Somebody from the office.

735
00:53:44,514 --> 00:53:46,391
Carry on his traditions.

736
00:53:46,558 --> 00:53:47,559
You?

737
00:53:51,938 --> 00:53:53,356
Mac, maybe.

738
00:53:54,691 --> 00:53:57,360
She'd make a great candidate,
in that wheelchair.

739
00:53:57,444 --> 00:53:59,946
That chair is not very telegenic.

740
00:54:01,990 --> 00:54:03,700
I think he'd pick you.

741
00:54:06,203 --> 00:54:07,913
You're the natural.

742
00:54:14,169 --> 00:54:15,212
Rusty...

743
00:54:15,337 --> 00:54:18,256
...if you let him know you want it,
it'll be you.

744
00:54:19,257 --> 00:54:21,885
I should just tell Raymond his time is up?

745
00:54:22,093 --> 00:54:23,929
-You could be tactful.
-No.

746
00:54:25,013 --> 00:54:26,223
Why not?

747
00:54:27,432 --> 00:54:29,601
I'm not going to bite that hand.

748
00:54:30,018 --> 00:54:32,437
If Raymond wants out, that's up to him.

749
00:54:32,771 --> 00:54:36,233
He's still the best candidate around,
against Della Guardia.

750
00:54:36,483 --> 00:54:39,444
Without Raymond,
Nico doesn't have an issue.

751
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:43,657
Pull the party's people and Raymond's
people together behind somebody else...

752
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:46,701
...that person would walk
into the PA's office.

753
00:54:47,244 --> 00:54:48,870
It wouldn't be close.

754
00:54:57,629 --> 00:54:59,798
You've thought a lot about this.

755
00:55:00,549 --> 00:55:02,425
He just needs a push.

756
00:55:06,012 --> 00:55:08,431
Push him yourself. It's not in me.

757
00:55:14,896 --> 00:55:15,856
What?

758
00:55:16,606 --> 00:55:19,401
Were you all set on being chief deputy?

759
00:55:21,278 --> 00:55:22,362
Carolyn...

760
00:55:24,447 --> 00:55:28,076
...if I can get away tonight
shall I get some take-out?

761
00:55:29,077 --> 00:55:31,746
I like you, Rusty, but I think it's over.

762
00:55:32,831 --> 00:55:35,458
It's just not right for me now. It's over.

763
00:55:35,542 --> 00:55:37,252
I don't accept that.

764
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:39,045
You don't accept it?

765
00:55:39,171 --> 00:55:40,672
Do I have a say?

766
00:55:43,216 --> 00:55:45,343
I don't want us to end up enemies.

767
00:55:53,810 --> 00:55:55,854
Mac said it was all right.

768
00:55:56,229 --> 00:55:57,689
Have it your way.

769
00:56:00,942 --> 00:56:02,694
Someone's in my office.

770
00:56:04,654 --> 00:56:05,864
What is it, Rusty?

771
00:56:05,947 --> 00:56:08,867
I wanted to talk about this rapist
you habitualized.

772
00:56:08,950 --> 00:56:10,577
There's some problems.

773
00:56:11,453 --> 00:56:13,371
I'm late for an appointment.

774
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:16,875
I would appreciate it
if you could put it in a memo.

775
00:56:17,501 --> 00:56:19,044
You keep avoiding me.

776
00:56:19,127 --> 00:56:22,714
You communicate through memos.
You skip meetings I'm supposed to go to.

777
00:56:22,797 --> 00:56:24,466
It's affecting work.

778
00:56:24,549 --> 00:56:25,675
My work?

779
00:56:26,843 --> 00:56:28,053
My work.

780
00:56:29,221 --> 00:56:31,556
I tried to make it easier for you.

781
00:56:34,643 --> 00:56:36,728
You make me feel uncomfortable.

782
00:56:36,812 --> 00:56:39,981
I just want to be with you.
Can't we just talk about it?

783
00:56:41,650 --> 00:56:44,027
I'm involved with someone else.

784
00:56:45,111 --> 00:56:46,404
Since when?

785
00:56:46,905 --> 00:56:48,907
What is it you want from me?

786
00:56:50,784 --> 00:56:52,410
What do I have to do?

787
00:56:54,663 --> 00:56:55,747
Grow up.

788
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:35,203
Rozat K. Sabich?

789
00:57:37,664 --> 00:57:39,583
Rusty, I don't like to be here.

790
00:57:39,666 --> 00:57:41,918
A search warrant for these premises.

791
00:57:44,796 --> 00:57:46,131
Come on in.

792
00:58:02,898 --> 00:58:05,400
They're taking swatches from your suits.

793
00:58:05,650 --> 00:58:08,820
They'll try to match threads
from my clothing and the carpet...

794
00:58:08,904 --> 00:58:11,740
...with fibers they might find
at her apartment.

795
00:58:11,823 --> 00:58:14,326
They're not looking for a murder weapon?

796
00:58:14,409 --> 00:58:16,578
I wouldn't be stupid enough
to bring it home.

797
00:58:16,661 --> 00:58:20,832
If they look for it and don't find it,
they'll have to admit that in court.

798
00:58:21,333 --> 00:58:23,668
I'll have to give a blood sample.

799
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:25,504
If you refuse?

800
00:58:26,046 --> 00:58:27,839
They've got a warrant.

801
00:58:28,006 --> 00:58:29,633
It's all routine.

802
00:58:30,842 --> 00:58:33,678
I'm going to ask Sandy Stern
to take my case.

803
00:58:39,684 --> 00:58:41,019
Hi, Sandy.

804
00:58:48,443 --> 00:58:52,280
I realize you would like to avoid
public places at a time like this...

805
00:58:52,364 --> 00:58:55,951
...but I don't think it is wise
for you to go into hiding.

806
00:58:57,118 --> 00:59:00,497
I'm flattered that you want me
to represent you in this case.

807
00:59:00,580 --> 00:59:03,208
You have been my toughest adversary.

808
00:59:05,168 --> 00:59:08,129
Did you get my subpoena
from the grand jury?

809
00:59:08,296 --> 00:59:11,299
This morning.
Clearly, we will not let you testify.

810
00:59:13,218 --> 00:59:16,388
Sandy, you expect me
to take the Fifth Amendment?

811
00:59:16,721 --> 00:59:18,056
Of course.

812
00:59:19,891 --> 00:59:21,309
That I cannot do.

813
00:59:22,894 --> 00:59:27,107
You don't want to prepare the prosecutor
by giving him pretrial statements.

814
00:59:27,190 --> 00:59:30,902
Sandy, I don't think this case
is ever going to go to trial.

815
00:59:31,653 --> 00:59:35,073
If I take the Fifth and refuse to testify
before the grand jury...

816
00:59:35,157 --> 00:59:37,325
...it could destroy my reputation.

817
00:59:39,995 --> 00:59:42,247
The results of the blood tests
have come back.

818
00:59:42,330 --> 00:59:45,959
They have identified you as someone
who secretes A-type antibodies...

819
00:59:46,042 --> 00:59:49,421
...just like the man who had last been
with Ms. Polhemus.

820
00:59:49,754 --> 00:59:52,757
Chances of this being a coincidence
are one in ten.

821
00:59:52,883 --> 00:59:56,928
So, I believe you will be charged
and that you will go to trial.

822
00:59:57,095 --> 01:00:01,766
Have you anything to tell this grand jury
about the death of Carolyn Polhemus?

823
01:00:02,058 --> 01:00:04,769
On the advice of counsel,
I decline to answer.

824
01:00:05,020 --> 01:00:09,399
Wouldn't it be fair to say you were rather
well acquainted with Ms. Polhemus?

825
01:00:09,608 --> 01:00:11,902
On the advice of counsel,
I decline to answer.

826
01:00:11,985 --> 01:00:14,779
Weren't you, in fact,
intimate with the lady?

827
01:00:16,281 --> 01:00:18,992
On the advice of counsel,
I decline to answer.

828
01:00:20,035 --> 01:00:23,246
You are under arrest.
"You have the right to remain silent.

829
01:00:23,330 --> 01:00:26,333
"Anything you say can and will
be used against you.

830
01:00:26,541 --> 01:00:30,128
"You have the right to have a lawyer
present during questioning.

831
01:00:30,587 --> 01:00:34,508
"lf you cannot hire a lawyer,
one will be appointed to represent you.

832
01:00:36,593 --> 01:00:39,429
"You may stop answering questions
at any time."

833
01:00:39,554 --> 01:00:42,224
Do you understand the rights
I have explained to you?

834
01:00:42,307 --> 01:00:44,392
Call Sandy Stern to make bail.

835
01:00:58,990 --> 01:01:00,992
Sandy should be available in a few hours.

836
01:01:01,076 --> 01:01:02,994
Let's see what they got.

837
01:01:03,829 --> 01:01:06,164
Can't believe there could be
any more surprises.

838
01:01:06,248 --> 01:01:09,584
That's when they come.
That's why they're called surprises.

839
01:01:13,421 --> 01:01:15,924
Do we now understand
Della Guardia's case?

840
01:01:17,342 --> 01:01:18,844
Yes, I think I do.

841
01:01:20,095 --> 01:01:21,596
Let me hear it.

842
01:01:25,517 --> 01:01:27,853
Sabich is obsessed with Polhemus.

843
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:30,689
She ditches him for another man.

844
01:01:31,189 --> 01:01:33,024
Sabich becomes enraged.

845
01:01:33,108 --> 01:01:34,693
He can't let go.

846
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:37,529
One night, knowing his wife is out...

847
01:01:37,612 --> 01:01:40,365
...he calls her and begs her
to see him again.

848
01:01:40,949 --> 01:01:42,951
Carolyn finally agrees.

849
01:01:44,119 --> 01:01:47,038
She rolls around with him
for auld lang syne.

850
01:01:47,330 --> 01:01:48,832
Then something goes wrong.

851
01:01:48,915 --> 01:01:52,377
Sabich is jealous. He wants more
than she's willing to give.

852
01:01:53,044 --> 01:01:54,254
He blows it.

853
01:01:54,337 --> 01:01:57,048
Gives her what for
with some heavy instrument.

854
01:01:57,257 --> 01:01:59,593
Decides to make it look like rape.

855
01:01:59,926 --> 01:02:03,763
Sabich is a prosecutor,
knows there'll be dozens of suspects.

856
01:02:04,556 --> 01:02:05,891
He ties her up.

857
01:02:05,974 --> 01:02:09,394
Opens the latches to make it look
like someone slipped in.

858
01:02:10,729 --> 01:02:12,981
And this is the diabolical part...

859
01:02:13,773 --> 01:02:16,651
...pulls out her diaphragm
so it looks like rape.

860
01:02:16,943 --> 01:02:20,030
But in his haste and confusion,
he makes mistakes.

861
01:02:20,780 --> 01:02:22,991
He forgets the glass he drank from.

862
01:02:23,158 --> 01:02:27,287
He doesn't think the forensic chemist
will be able to ID the spermicide.

863
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:30,582
But we know he did evil to this woman...

864
01:02:30,790 --> 01:02:35,295
...because he lied about his presence
in her apartment the night she was killed.

865
01:02:35,795 --> 01:02:37,923
His fingerprints on the glass...

866
01:02:38,006 --> 01:02:40,675
...his blood type A identified from semen...

867
01:02:41,176 --> 01:02:45,055
...fibers from the carpets in his home,
tell us he was there.

868
01:02:47,098 --> 01:02:48,767
Very convincing.

869
01:02:50,936 --> 01:02:53,271
But their evidence of motive is weak.

870
01:02:53,355 --> 01:02:55,440
That's where we must attack.

871
01:02:55,899 --> 01:03:00,070
Is there any proof of prior
amorous relationship between the two?

872
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:01,404
A few telephone calls.

873
01:03:01,488 --> 01:03:03,615
They can be accounted for
by business needs.

874
01:03:03,698 --> 01:03:04,950
-Any diary?
-No.

875
01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:08,745
No note that came with flowers?
No lovers' correspondence?

876
01:03:08,829 --> 01:03:09,996
-No.
-Good.

877
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:11,665
Gossip will not be admitted.

878
01:03:11,748 --> 01:03:15,752
There are calls from my home to Carolyn's
in October of last year.

879
01:03:15,919 --> 01:03:18,880
You were trying the case
of Wendell McGaffney then.

880
01:03:19,172 --> 01:03:20,924
Reason enough for calling her.

881
01:03:21,007 --> 01:03:24,344
Why did I tell Lipranzer not to get
my home phone records?

882
01:03:24,427 --> 01:03:27,806
I take it for granted that a person
of an innocent state of mind...

883
01:03:27,889 --> 01:03:29,933
...would rule himself out as a suspect...

884
01:03:30,016 --> 01:03:33,019
...and save a busy detective
from wasting time.

885
01:03:34,354 --> 01:03:38,275
Clearly, they hope to win the case
on the strength of their physical evidence.

886
01:03:38,358 --> 01:03:41,403
I'd like to look at that glass.
It could help me.

887
01:03:41,486 --> 01:03:43,822
List a motion for production
of physical evidence.

888
01:03:43,905 --> 01:03:46,491
I want an inventory of everything
in that apartment.

889
01:03:46,575 --> 01:03:48,952
Where's the contraceptive jelly...

890
01:03:49,244 --> 01:03:53,039
...the chemist is saying he finds present?
ln her medicine cabinet?

891
01:03:53,123 --> 01:03:54,583
I don't know.

892
01:03:57,669 --> 01:03:59,671
I'll hear worse in court.

893
01:04:00,338 --> 01:04:02,674
I never asked her what she was doing.

894
01:04:02,799 --> 01:04:04,342
One word of caution.

895
01:04:04,551 --> 01:04:07,053
We do not want to lead Della Guardia...

896
01:04:07,262 --> 01:04:10,056
...to evidence he has not thought to obtain.

897
01:04:10,515 --> 01:04:14,686
Best we conduct a search ourselves
without disclosing our intentions.

898
01:04:15,270 --> 01:04:19,733
Also, your mention of Carolyn's
personal habits leads to this thought.

899
01:04:20,734 --> 01:04:23,028
We should subpoena her doctors.

900
01:04:23,528 --> 01:04:25,572
Who knows what we might discover.

901
01:04:25,655 --> 01:04:28,074
There's one big surprise, however.

902
01:04:29,868 --> 01:04:32,329
Raymond Horgan's on their witness list.

903
01:04:32,829 --> 01:04:33,914
Why?

904
01:04:35,248 --> 01:04:37,918
It's a hell of a way to impress
my new partners.

905
01:04:38,001 --> 01:04:41,004
I'm here three days
and I get a grand jury subpoena.

906
01:04:42,005 --> 01:04:45,842
I was wondering what we might expect,
in terms of your testimony.

907
01:04:47,677 --> 01:04:51,765
I'm going to testify about Rusty's conduct
of the Polhemus investigation.

908
01:04:52,098 --> 01:04:54,976
-How he volunteered to handle it.
-Just a second.

909
01:04:56,186 --> 01:04:58,188
You insisted I take it on.

910
01:04:58,355 --> 01:04:59,940
I don't remember it that way.

911
01:05:00,023 --> 01:05:02,025
What are you trying to do to me?

912
01:05:02,108 --> 01:05:04,110
What am I trying to do to you?

913
01:05:04,861 --> 01:05:06,947
What are you trying to do to me?

914
01:05:10,784 --> 01:05:12,702
I thought I had your loyalty.

915
01:05:16,331 --> 01:05:19,084
Why didn't you tell me
about you and Carolyn?

916
01:05:19,167 --> 01:05:23,255
Under the circumstances,
I have to advise Rusty not to respond.

917
01:05:24,589 --> 01:05:26,341
Clearly, he would like to.

918
01:05:26,508 --> 01:05:28,552
Let me ask you something.

919
01:05:29,052 --> 01:05:32,180
Why were his fingerprints
all over that goddamn glass?

920
01:05:33,723 --> 01:05:35,892
That's what I'm going to testify.

921
01:05:36,393 --> 01:05:38,228
That he wanted the case.

922
01:05:38,562 --> 01:05:41,731
That I had to chew his ass
to get him to move on it.

923
01:05:42,858 --> 01:05:45,360
He seemed more interested in if,
when and how...

924
01:05:45,443 --> 01:05:48,864
...l was fucking Carolyn Polhemus
than in his own investigation.

925
01:05:48,947 --> 01:05:51,658
When push came to shove,
he stood in my office...

926
01:05:51,741 --> 01:05:56,371
...he told us he'd been nowhere near
her apartment the night she was killed.

927
01:05:59,332 --> 01:06:01,501
That's what I'm going to testify.

928
01:06:02,085 --> 01:06:04,546
And I'll be goddamned pleased to do it.

929
01:06:05,672 --> 01:06:08,758
How can you think
that I could do a thing like that?

930
01:06:12,345 --> 01:06:14,931
You always had the cork in too tight.

931
01:06:15,932 --> 01:06:17,517
We all saw that.

932
01:06:19,936 --> 01:06:21,938
When you blew, you blew.

933
01:06:23,648 --> 01:06:25,233
Come on, Rusty.

934
01:06:32,908 --> 01:06:36,953
When did this relationship take place
between Raymond and Carolyn?

935
01:06:37,245 --> 01:06:39,623
Just after she stopped seeing me.

936
01:06:41,875 --> 01:06:43,793
Delay's got his motive.

937
01:06:46,046 --> 01:06:50,550
What if I told you Raymond secretly
assigned a bribery case to Carolyn?

938
01:06:51,301 --> 01:06:54,721
Some poor son of a bitch
on a public-indecency charge...

939
01:06:54,804 --> 01:06:57,432
...paid off a PA to have his case dismissed.

940
01:06:57,599 --> 01:07:01,061
Turns out, the guy's probation officer
is Carolyn...

941
01:07:01,770 --> 01:07:04,981
...and the deputy assigned to the case
is Tommy Molto.

942
01:07:06,066 --> 01:07:09,986
Day after I find this out,
I'm charged with Carolyn's murder.

943
01:07:12,489 --> 01:07:15,367
Before we venture down the road
into actual accusation...

944
01:07:15,450 --> 01:07:18,161
...we must consider the matter
very carefully.

945
01:07:20,997 --> 01:07:24,334
It can't be a coincidence
it lays out this way, Sandy.

946
01:07:30,090 --> 01:07:31,967
I mean, I'm innocent.

947
01:07:39,349 --> 01:07:42,018
God, I made a fool of myself today
with Sandy.

948
01:07:42,352 --> 01:07:43,478
How?

949
01:07:43,854 --> 01:07:45,689
I told him I was innocent.

950
01:07:47,065 --> 01:07:49,359
I thought he would've asked you that
by now.

951
01:07:49,442 --> 01:07:51,027
No, it's axiomatic.

952
01:07:51,611 --> 01:07:53,864
Defendants rarely tell the truth.

953
01:07:54,990 --> 01:07:59,369
Lie to the cops, lie to your lawyer,
lie to the jury that tries your case.

954
01:08:00,871 --> 01:08:03,874
Leave the bastards out there
with a grain of doubt.

955
01:08:09,629 --> 01:08:11,131
You never asked.

956
01:08:13,133 --> 01:08:14,801
If you're innocent?

957
01:08:19,764 --> 01:08:21,349
You want me to?

958
01:08:38,074 --> 01:08:39,576
Please draw a name.

959
01:08:48,084 --> 01:08:50,003
"Judge Larren Lyttle."

960
01:08:50,837 --> 01:08:53,215
I have some motions from the defense.

961
01:08:53,298 --> 01:08:56,301
Mr. Stern, you want to examine
the scene of the crime?

962
01:08:56,384 --> 01:08:59,221
Yes, Your Honor.
To evaluate the physical evidence...

963
01:08:59,304 --> 01:09:02,766
...to see if it actually proves
what the prosecution claims.

964
01:09:02,974 --> 01:09:04,392
Mr. Della Guardia?

965
01:09:04,601 --> 01:09:07,479
With proviso that nothing be removed,
nothing disturbed.

966
01:09:07,562 --> 01:09:09,564
-No objection.
-Granted.

967
01:09:10,273 --> 01:09:12,275
Mr. Stern, anything further?

968
01:09:12,609 --> 01:09:15,946
We notice that Mr. Molto is listed
both as a prosecutor...

969
01:09:16,029 --> 01:09:19,449
...and as a witness for the prosecution.
We object to that.

970
01:09:19,574 --> 01:09:22,160
I take it you are speaking
of where Mr. Sabich...

971
01:09:22,244 --> 01:09:26,414
...responds to Mr. Molto's accusation
of murder by saying: "You're right."

972
01:09:27,958 --> 01:09:29,835
"Yeah, you're right."

973
01:09:30,377 --> 01:09:32,838
Your Honor, the man admitted the crime.

974
01:09:32,963 --> 01:09:35,590
Come on, Mr. Delay Guardia. Really.

975
01:09:36,633 --> 01:09:40,720
Tell a man he's engaged in wrongdoing
and he says, "Yeah, you're right."

976
01:09:40,846 --> 01:09:44,224
Everyone knows that's facetious.
We're all familiar with that.

977
01:09:44,307 --> 01:09:47,644
Shit, if Mr. Sabich had come
from my neighborhood...

978
01:09:47,894 --> 01:09:50,147
...he would've said, "Your momma."

979
01:09:51,148 --> 01:09:55,152
But, in Mr. Sabich's part of town
I would think they would say:

980
01:09:55,652 --> 01:09:57,404
"Yeah, you're right."

981
01:09:57,487 --> 01:10:00,282
And what they mean is, "You are wrong."

982
01:10:00,615 --> 01:10:02,325
Just to be polite.

983
01:10:04,494 --> 01:10:07,664
Your Honor, isn't that a question
for the jury?

984
01:10:07,998 --> 01:10:12,502
On the contrary, Mr. Delay Guardia,
it is first a question for the court.

985
01:10:13,170 --> 01:10:17,507
If you use Mr. Sabich's statement
and risk my ruling it out of order...

986
01:10:18,008 --> 01:10:20,427
...then I will bar Mr. Molto
from prosecuting.

987
01:10:20,510 --> 01:10:22,721
But if he is the prosecutor...

988
01:10:23,346 --> 01:10:26,349
...then Mr. Sabich's statement
may not be offered.

989
01:10:27,434 --> 01:10:30,020
And I'll see you in court in three weeks.

990
01:10:31,396 --> 01:10:33,940
Ernestine, show in the next bunch.

991
01:10:42,365 --> 01:10:44,784
What the fuck are you doing with those?

992
01:10:44,868 --> 01:10:49,706
We don't want Molto thinking fingerprints
we leave here today are from before.

993
01:10:51,249 --> 01:10:55,253
We're not going to plant anything,
if that's what you're worried about.

994
01:10:57,506 --> 01:10:59,007
The law's the law.

995
01:11:00,509 --> 01:11:02,511
Yeah, I know, Glendenning.

996
01:11:09,017 --> 01:11:10,352
Diaphragm?

997
01:11:11,853 --> 01:11:13,605
I don't know. The bathroom?

998
01:11:13,688 --> 01:11:14,856
Where?

999
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:03,488
Nothing.

1000
01:12:03,738 --> 01:12:06,074
Fucking cops always forget something.

1001
01:12:06,992 --> 01:12:08,243
What is it?

1002
01:12:08,577 --> 01:12:09,911
Her phone book.

1003
01:12:10,412 --> 01:12:13,331
Check with her doctors
on the contraceptive stuff.

1004
01:12:13,915 --> 01:12:16,543
Carolyn never seemed worried
about anything like that.

1005
01:12:16,626 --> 01:12:20,547
She's got them under "D."
Jesus, she's got a lot of doctors.

1006
01:12:21,673 --> 01:12:25,802
If the chemist says spermicide is present,
and it's not seized from here...

1007
01:12:25,886 --> 01:12:27,846
...then you tell me where it's at?

1008
01:12:27,929 --> 01:12:31,433
I don't know. Maybe I took it
when I took the diaphragm.

1009
01:12:32,267 --> 01:12:34,102
It doesn't make sense.

1010
01:12:35,770 --> 01:12:39,107
You got to remember,
I wasn't thinking very clearly.

1011
01:12:40,942 --> 01:12:44,613
If I had been, I wouldn't have left
my fingerprints on the glass.

1012
01:12:46,323 --> 01:12:48,158
You were a former chief deputy prosecutor.

1013
01:12:48,241 --> 01:12:50,827
How does it feel to be on the other side?

1014
01:12:53,872 --> 01:12:56,541
Think you might be a political scapegoat?

1015
01:12:56,791 --> 01:13:00,337
Sorry, we're not about to try this case
on the courthouse steps.

1016
01:13:00,420 --> 01:13:02,714
How do you feel about your husband, now?

1017
01:13:02,797 --> 01:13:03,965
All rise.

1018
01:13:06,801 --> 01:13:10,305
The Superior Court for the county
of Kindle is now in session.

1019
01:13:10,388 --> 01:13:13,642
The Honorable Larren L. Lyttle,
judge presiding.

1020
01:13:14,643 --> 01:13:17,896
Draw near and give your attention
and you shall be heard.

1021
01:13:17,979 --> 01:13:21,191
God save the United States
and this honorable court.

1022
01:13:21,358 --> 01:13:24,319
The People vs. Rozat K. Sabich, for trial.

1023
01:13:25,737 --> 01:13:27,447
May it please the court.

1024
01:13:27,614 --> 01:13:31,076
The State's evidence will show
that on or about April 1 ...

1025
01:13:31,243 --> 01:13:34,663
...Carolyn Polhemus, a deputy prosecutor
in Kindle County...

1026
01:13:35,497 --> 01:13:37,332
...was brutally murdered.

1027
01:13:38,333 --> 01:13:42,379
The proof will show that this murder
was perpetrated by her colleague...

1028
01:13:42,838 --> 01:13:44,631
...Rozat K. Sabich.

1029
01:13:45,882 --> 01:13:48,677
How are we to answer this,
Rusty Sabich and l?

1030
01:13:50,262 --> 01:13:54,766
Mr. Della Guardia's case involves no facts
but supposition upon supposition.

1031
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:57,310
Guess upon guess.

1032
01:13:58,770 --> 01:14:01,648
When you listen to the evidence,
ask yourselves...

1033
01:14:01,773 --> 01:14:03,525
...why Rusty Sabich...

1034
01:14:04,526 --> 01:14:07,195
...the finest prosecutor of this county...

1035
01:14:08,530 --> 01:14:11,575
...a man who has devoted his life
to preventing...

1036
01:14:11,783 --> 01:14:15,453
...and punishing criminal behavior,
not to committing it...

1037
01:14:17,873 --> 01:14:20,041
...sits here as the accused.

1038
01:14:21,543 --> 01:14:22,627
Why?

1039
01:14:22,794 --> 01:14:24,796
The State calls Detective Harold Greer.

1040
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:27,215
May we have a word with the bench?

1041
01:14:28,717 --> 01:14:32,804
This witness will testify about a bar glass.
They have no bar glass.

1042
01:14:33,263 --> 01:14:34,806
What about this?

1043
01:14:35,140 --> 01:14:38,143
I learned the first time last night,
from Tommy....

1044
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:41,021
Hold it right there. Inside, gentlemen.

1045
01:14:41,271 --> 01:14:44,316
I request that Mr. Sabich join us
in chambers.

1046
01:14:44,399 --> 01:14:46,902
He is an integral part of the defense.

1047
01:14:50,238 --> 01:14:52,032
Where is the fucking glass?

1048
01:14:52,115 --> 01:14:56,786
Police Evidence Room was where it
was supposed to be, but they can't find it.

1049
01:14:57,245 --> 01:15:01,583
We won't be talking about evidence
that nobody can find. Not in my court.

1050
01:15:04,127 --> 01:15:08,423
We don't object to the photographs,
just to testimony about fingerprints.

1051
01:15:09,299 --> 01:15:11,593
I will reserve decision, gentlemen.

1052
01:15:13,929 --> 01:15:17,557
A stroke of luck. Their disorganization
will help us with the jury.

1053
01:15:17,641 --> 01:15:19,559
They'll find the glass. They always do.

1054
01:15:19,643 --> 01:15:22,646
Ladies and gentlemen,
these photos depict horrors...

1055
01:15:22,729 --> 01:15:25,774
...you may be expected to react to
with disgust.

1056
01:15:26,566 --> 01:15:28,860
But I am instructing you,
that in themselves...

1057
01:15:28,944 --> 01:15:32,447
...they are proof of nothing
except the nature of the crime.

1058
01:15:46,253 --> 01:15:47,796
How you doing?

1059
01:15:48,338 --> 01:15:51,550
-They making it tough on you?
- Those cupcakes? Come on.

1060
01:15:52,175 --> 01:15:54,219
Is there anything you need?

1061
01:15:55,428 --> 01:15:58,390
Yeah, I got to find this guy, Leon.
Leon Wells.

1062
01:15:58,557 --> 01:16:02,561
The guy who's supposed to have bribed
the PA at the North Branch.

1063
01:16:03,854 --> 01:16:06,815
I wouldn't ask, but it might really matter.

1064
01:16:07,107 --> 01:16:11,027
Think Molto's kinky on this?
Set you up to keep you from looking?

1065
01:16:11,361 --> 01:16:14,823
You want to hear me say
I think it might be possible? I do.

1066
01:16:14,948 --> 01:16:16,825
Okay, after I testify.

1067
01:16:17,409 --> 01:16:18,994
They got their eyes on me.

1068
01:16:19,077 --> 01:16:23,081
When I'm off the stand, they'll ease up.
I'll work on it then. Hard.

1069
01:16:23,665 --> 01:16:25,000
You're a pal.

1070
01:16:27,836 --> 01:16:29,337
Is he gonna help?

1071
01:16:30,714 --> 01:16:33,633
After he testifies.
Might be too late by then.

1072
01:16:34,843 --> 01:16:36,845
I think it's going well.

1073
01:16:37,679 --> 01:16:41,516
The jury's gonna remember pictures
of Carolyn tortured to death.

1074
01:16:43,351 --> 01:16:45,812
They'll want somebody to pay
for what they saw.

1075
01:16:45,896 --> 01:16:47,272
Tomorrow, Raymond...

1076
01:16:47,355 --> 01:16:51,193
...my friend and mentor,
will testify he thinks I'm guilty.

1077
01:16:53,403 --> 01:16:55,572
Then come the physical proofs:

1078
01:16:55,906 --> 01:16:58,617
Fingerprints. Fiber. Bodily fluids.

1079
01:17:02,871 --> 01:17:04,623
They all point to me.

1080
01:17:05,081 --> 01:17:07,542
You know the defendant, Rozat Sabich?

1081
01:17:08,460 --> 01:17:12,172
Sure, I know Rusty. I've known him
since he was a law student.

1082
01:17:12,255 --> 01:17:13,715
He was my second in command.

1083
01:17:13,798 --> 01:17:15,634
Would you identify him?

1084
01:17:21,306 --> 01:17:22,516
That's him.

1085
01:17:24,518 --> 01:17:28,647
You assigned Mr. Sabich to supervise
the investigation in this case?

1086
01:17:30,732 --> 01:17:32,234
He volunteered.

1087
01:17:32,317 --> 01:17:33,610
And I accepted.

1088
01:17:34,027 --> 01:17:36,530
He promised to pursue it vigorously.

1089
01:17:36,738 --> 01:17:37,864
Did he?

1090
01:17:37,989 --> 01:17:40,158
Not to my way of thinking, no.

1091
01:17:41,159 --> 01:17:43,995
I got the feeling he was stalling
on the investigation.

1092
01:17:44,079 --> 01:17:46,998
I let him know that I wasn't happy
about that.

1093
01:17:49,376 --> 01:17:52,587
He brought in his own detective
to replace Harold Greer.

1094
01:17:52,796 --> 01:17:56,299
Then he gave his new partner instructions
to ignore evidence...

1095
01:17:56,383 --> 01:17:59,678
...about telephone calls
between his house and Carolyn's.

1096
01:18:01,012 --> 01:18:05,058
He tried to limit the scope of
the fingerprint search to exclude his own.

1097
01:18:07,477 --> 01:18:11,857
He was more interested in whether I had
been intimate with Carolyn Polhemus...

1098
01:18:12,107 --> 01:18:14,359
...than in the facts surrounding her murder.

1099
01:18:14,442 --> 01:18:17,028
What did you tell him
about you and Ms. Polhemus?

1100
01:18:17,112 --> 01:18:18,697
I told him the truth.

1101
01:18:19,406 --> 01:18:21,658
That we'd been together
for about three months.

1102
01:18:21,741 --> 01:18:23,869
This, of course, was after I was divorced.

1103
01:18:23,952 --> 01:18:26,121
At that time, or any other time...

1104
01:18:26,246 --> 01:18:29,082
...did he inform you
of his personal relationship with her?

1105
01:18:29,166 --> 01:18:33,295
There is no proof in the record
of any relationship between them.

1106
01:18:33,712 --> 01:18:35,714
I'll let the question stand.

1107
01:18:36,715 --> 01:18:41,136
But Mr. Della Guardia is asking a question
based on his assumption...

1108
01:18:41,761 --> 01:18:46,057
...that something was going on
between Mr. Sabich and Ms. Polhemus.

1109
01:18:46,433 --> 01:18:48,685
Just because he thinks it's so...

1110
01:18:48,935 --> 01:18:50,604
...doesn't make it so.

1111
01:18:51,396 --> 01:18:52,564
Proceed.

1112
01:18:53,356 --> 01:18:55,901
I never would've let him handle
the investigation...

1113
01:18:55,984 --> 01:18:58,987
...if I thought he'd been intimate
with the victim.

1114
01:18:59,446 --> 01:19:01,114
Nothing further.

1115
01:19:01,740 --> 01:19:03,283
Have you any...

1116
01:19:03,575 --> 01:19:05,494
...personal knowledge...

1117
01:19:05,619 --> 01:19:09,831
...that there was ever a relationship
between Mr. Sabich and Ms. Polhemus?

1118
01:19:10,123 --> 01:19:11,875
That's the point. He didn't tell me.

1119
01:19:11,958 --> 01:19:14,336
Please answer the question I asked you.

1120
01:19:15,754 --> 01:19:17,714
Do you remember the question?

1121
01:19:17,923 --> 01:19:18,924
I do.

1122
01:19:19,466 --> 01:19:21,551
But you chose not to answer it.

1123
01:19:22,427 --> 01:19:24,221
I apologize, Mr. Stern.

1124
01:19:24,471 --> 01:19:28,266
I have no personal knowledge
that such a relationship ever existed.

1125
01:19:28,517 --> 01:19:31,144
Assuming there was something
to disclose...

1126
01:19:31,269 --> 01:19:35,649
...you believe he should have informed
anyone in a responsible position?

1127
01:19:35,732 --> 01:19:36,525
I do.

1128
01:19:36,608 --> 01:19:40,111
Certainly you would give any information
you had on a case...

1129
01:19:40,237 --> 01:19:42,489
...to your investigating staff?

1130
01:19:42,656 --> 01:19:43,949
Certainly.

1131
01:19:44,825 --> 01:19:46,076
Mr. Horgan...

1132
01:19:46,535 --> 01:19:49,621
...you removed a file, a so-called B file...

1133
01:19:49,955 --> 01:19:54,167
...from Ms. Polhemus's office after
the investigation of her murder began?

1134
01:19:54,584 --> 01:19:56,336
What's the relevance of this?

1135
01:19:56,419 --> 01:19:59,297
The witness has testified
on direct examination...

1136
01:19:59,381 --> 01:20:03,260
...that Mr. Sabich did not bring
to his attention information...

1137
01:20:03,426 --> 01:20:05,011
...that he regarded as pertinent.

1138
01:20:05,095 --> 01:20:09,724
The defense is entitled to explore
Mr. Horgan's standards in this regard.

1139
01:20:10,350 --> 01:20:13,270
Subject to a later connection, I'll allow it.

1140
01:20:14,104 --> 01:20:15,605
Continue, Counselor.

1141
01:20:16,106 --> 01:20:19,025
And you gave that B file to Mr. Sabich...

1142
01:20:19,442 --> 01:20:23,488
...only after he informed you it was missing
from Ms. Polhemus's office?

1143
01:20:24,322 --> 01:20:25,699
That's true.

1144
01:20:26,783 --> 01:20:29,703
You've told us that you
and Carolyn were lovers.

1145
01:20:30,287 --> 01:20:31,913
For a short time, yes.

1146
01:20:32,956 --> 01:20:34,499
B-file cases...

1147
01:20:34,958 --> 01:20:38,044
...cases involving bribery
and official misconduct...

1148
01:20:38,503 --> 01:20:41,715
...are normally assigned
to the assistant deputy.

1149
01:20:42,132 --> 01:20:44,718
At the time, Mr. Sabich. Is that not true?

1150
01:20:44,801 --> 01:20:46,595
That was the usual practice, yes.

1151
01:20:46,678 --> 01:20:50,307
You gave this highly sensitive matter
in this B file...

1152
01:20:50,515 --> 01:20:53,518
...to Carolyn Polhemus
while you were sleeping with her?

1153
01:20:53,602 --> 01:20:55,729
That appears to be the time frame.

1154
01:20:57,939 --> 01:21:00,108
The answer to the question is yes.

1155
01:21:01,526 --> 01:21:06,239
Weren't you concerned, in the midst
of a nip-and-tuck election campaign...

1156
01:21:06,656 --> 01:21:10,076
...about word leaking out
that you had secretly given a file...

1157
01:21:10,160 --> 01:21:12,537
...that was in Mr. Sabich's area
of authority...

1158
01:21:12,621 --> 01:21:15,373
...to an assistant with no experience
in such matters...

1159
01:21:15,457 --> 01:21:18,043
...with whom you were sleeping
at the time?

1160
01:21:19,169 --> 01:21:21,171
It may have crossed my mind.

1161
01:21:22,339 --> 01:21:25,175
Who knows? It was not an ideal situation.

1162
01:21:26,676 --> 01:21:27,928
Far from it.

1163
01:21:29,721 --> 01:21:30,931
And, sir...

1164
01:21:31,473 --> 01:21:33,475
...you come to this courtroom...

1165
01:21:33,558 --> 01:21:35,519
...where the life of a man...

1166
01:21:35,644 --> 01:21:39,815
...who served you faithfully for 1 2 years
now hangs in the balance...

1167
01:21:39,981 --> 01:21:42,692
...and you tell us
you withheld evidence from him...

1168
01:21:42,776 --> 01:21:45,862
...that might have assisted
in his investigation?

1169
01:21:57,707 --> 01:21:58,834
All right.

1170
01:22:02,420 --> 01:22:04,047
Is it fair to say...

1171
01:22:04,548 --> 01:22:07,592
...that the chief deputy is the person
in the office...

1172
01:22:07,676 --> 01:22:10,846
...in whose judgement you place
the greatest confidence?

1173
01:22:12,681 --> 01:22:15,684
I regarded him as the best lawyer
for the job, yes.

1174
01:22:15,809 --> 01:22:18,478
And you gave Mr. Sabich the authority...

1175
01:22:18,937 --> 01:22:22,315
...to decide when and where
to fire Mr. Della Guardia?

1176
01:22:22,524 --> 01:22:23,900
Gentlemen...

1177
01:22:24,484 --> 01:22:26,319
...let's stop right there.

1178
01:22:28,321 --> 01:22:30,824
What is the relevance of who fired who?

1179
01:22:31,032 --> 01:22:35,370
Judge, it's our theory that Mr. Sabich
is being framed in this case.

1180
01:22:36,830 --> 01:22:39,791
-I don't believe it.
-Your response has been noted.

1181
01:22:40,041 --> 01:22:43,211
If Mr. Stern is truly going to endeavor
to prove...

1182
01:22:43,336 --> 01:22:46,798
...that the case against Mr. Sabich
has been manufactured...

1183
01:22:46,923 --> 01:22:50,719
...then this history of antagonism
is relevant for those purposes.

1184
01:22:50,844 --> 01:22:53,138
What about this missing B file?

1185
01:22:53,221 --> 01:22:56,266
We believe it's being withheld
because it contains evidence...

1186
01:22:56,349 --> 01:22:58,477
...that is necessary to the defense.

1187
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:01,313
So, we intend to pursue this matter...

1188
01:23:01,771 --> 01:23:05,567
...until we have a full understanding
on how it bears on the truth.

1189
01:23:05,901 --> 01:23:09,654
I don't know where this will lead us,
but I'll tell you two things:

1190
01:23:09,821 --> 01:23:12,616
You'd better be prepared
for the prosecution's response...

1191
01:23:12,699 --> 01:23:17,120
...because he is going to be entitled
to a great deal of latitude in answering.

1192
01:23:17,454 --> 01:23:19,748
'Cause I am going to give him that.

1193
01:23:24,669 --> 01:23:28,757
Do you recall we spoke about a B file
that you assigned to Ms. Polhemus?

1194
01:23:29,508 --> 01:23:31,593
I'll remember it for quite some time.

1195
01:23:31,676 --> 01:23:34,846
-Was Mr. Molto involved in this case?
-Objection!

1196
01:23:34,971 --> 01:23:36,473
Objection sustained.

1197
01:23:36,640 --> 01:23:39,267
Mr. Stern, you're playing with fire.

1198
01:23:40,894 --> 01:23:44,439
Do you know what investigation, if any,
Mr. Molto pursued--

1199
01:23:44,523 --> 01:23:46,566
I'll answer that! He took no action.

1200
01:23:46,650 --> 01:23:49,110
He wasn't going to chase
Sabich's red herrings.

1201
01:23:49,194 --> 01:23:52,656
Mr. Della Guardia, you will remember
you're the prosecutor...

1202
01:23:52,739 --> 01:23:54,324
...not the witness.

1203
01:24:00,205 --> 01:24:04,459
Perhaps we can all learn something
about red herrings and scapegoats.

1204
01:24:05,460 --> 01:24:06,878
That is all.

1205
01:24:07,295 --> 01:24:09,881
This court is adjourned for the weekend.

1206
01:24:11,466 --> 01:24:13,802
I don't understand what you're doing.

1207
01:24:14,219 --> 01:24:16,221
You're alienating the judge.

1208
01:24:16,471 --> 01:24:20,559
When I said they manufactured a case,
you wanted nothing to do with it.

1209
01:24:20,976 --> 01:24:23,019
Clearly, I changed my mind.

1210
01:24:23,311 --> 01:24:24,938
On the basis of what?

1211
01:24:25,355 --> 01:24:26,565
Instinct.

1212
01:24:30,694 --> 01:24:33,113
If you don't like it,
you can always come home.

1213
01:24:33,196 --> 01:24:34,489
I wanna go.

1214
01:24:34,906 --> 01:24:36,867
All my friends will be there.

1215
01:24:37,534 --> 01:24:38,910
I'll be okay.

1216
01:24:43,165 --> 01:24:45,041
Come here. Sit down.

1217
01:24:47,043 --> 01:24:49,880
Look, I'm accused of doing something
I didn't do.

1218
01:24:50,547 --> 01:24:54,050
This trial is gonna give me a chance
to clear myself.

1219
01:24:54,759 --> 01:24:56,970
-That's what's gonna happen.
-Of course.

1220
01:24:57,053 --> 01:24:58,263
Of course.

1221
01:24:59,473 --> 01:25:01,975
Here are the postcards. Use them.

1222
01:25:02,100 --> 01:25:04,436
-Don't forget to write.
-They make me.

1223
01:25:04,936 --> 01:25:06,354
What about me?

1224
01:25:17,073 --> 01:25:18,658
Did Mr. Sabich ever tell you...

1225
01:25:18,742 --> 01:25:21,828
...he had a personal relationship
with Ms. Polhemus?

1226
01:25:22,370 --> 01:25:23,371
No.

1227
01:25:23,830 --> 01:25:25,499
Did Mr. Sabich, at any time...

1228
01:25:25,582 --> 01:25:29,419
...order you not to get phone records
of calls from his home?

1229
01:25:29,544 --> 01:25:31,963
He never ordered me. He asked me.

1230
01:25:32,130 --> 01:25:34,716
He asked you not to get those records?

1231
01:25:35,050 --> 01:25:36,176
Did you oblige him?

1232
01:25:36,259 --> 01:25:39,387
I was taken off the case
before I got to those records.

1233
01:25:39,513 --> 01:25:42,224
-You did or did not get those records?
-I did not.

1234
01:25:42,307 --> 01:25:45,435
We had a lot of higher-priority items
on our mind.

1235
01:25:47,187 --> 01:25:48,647
A high-priority item...

1236
01:25:48,730 --> 01:25:53,193
...was the analysis of fingerprints found
in Ms. Polhemus's apartment.

1237
01:25:53,485 --> 01:25:55,529
Who talked with the Fingerprint Lab?

1238
01:25:55,612 --> 01:25:56,738
Mr. Sabich.

1239
01:25:56,822 --> 01:25:58,782
Did you ask him to expedite the reports?

1240
01:25:58,865 --> 01:25:59,950
Yes, sir, I did.

1241
01:26:00,033 --> 01:26:02,327
What did he say, if anything?

1242
01:26:02,994 --> 01:26:04,371
He said he forgot.

1243
01:26:04,454 --> 01:26:05,789
He forgot?

1244
01:26:09,042 --> 01:26:10,544
Rusty forgot.

1245
01:26:11,628 --> 01:26:14,840
Would it be fair to say the two of you,
by working together...

1246
01:26:14,923 --> 01:26:17,259
...have formed a personal friendship?

1247
01:26:17,843 --> 01:26:19,427
I suppose so, yes.

1248
01:26:19,761 --> 01:26:21,388
Were you assigned initially?

1249
01:26:21,471 --> 01:26:24,141
Harold Greer initially handled the case.

1250
01:26:25,433 --> 01:26:27,686
Has Mr. Sabich ever expressed to you...

1251
01:26:27,769 --> 01:26:30,814
...any reservations about
Harold Greer's abilities?

1252
01:26:31,064 --> 01:26:34,693
Everybody that I know thinks
of Harold Greer as a top-grade cop.

1253
01:26:34,943 --> 01:26:39,072
Do you know who decided to replace
Harold Greer and bring you on this case?

1254
01:26:39,156 --> 01:26:40,574
Mr. Sabich.

1255
01:26:42,993 --> 01:26:44,286
Do you feel....

1256
01:26:44,369 --> 01:26:45,453
Withdrawn.

1257
01:26:45,954 --> 01:26:49,875
To your knowledge, does the defendant
have a closer personal relationship...

1258
01:26:49,958 --> 01:26:53,420
...with anyone on the police force
than he does with you?

1259
01:26:53,962 --> 01:26:55,881
Not that he's mentioned, no.

1260
01:26:56,381 --> 01:26:58,508
So it's fair to say, Detective...

1261
01:26:58,592 --> 01:27:03,221
...that you are the police officer
least likely to suspect him of murder.

1262
01:27:04,097 --> 01:27:06,683
I would never believe that. Never.

1263
01:27:07,184 --> 01:27:09,394
Thank you for your cooperation
and answering...

1264
01:27:09,478 --> 01:27:12,939
...what must have been painful
and difficult questions for you...

1265
01:27:13,023 --> 01:27:15,734
...considering your relationship
to the defendant.

1266
01:27:15,817 --> 01:27:17,152
Nothing further.

1267
01:27:20,697 --> 01:27:23,533
You made reference to a theory
you were developing that...

1268
01:27:23,617 --> 01:27:26,786
...Ms. Polhemus might have been
the victim of a revenge killer.

1269
01:27:26,870 --> 01:27:28,705
Someone she had once sent to jail.

1270
01:27:28,788 --> 01:27:32,375
Yes, sir. We thought of that
as our most likely case.

1271
01:27:32,792 --> 01:27:35,128
To identify possible suspects...

1272
01:27:35,587 --> 01:27:40,217
...you reviewed cases she had prosecuted,
and was currently prosecuting...

1273
01:27:40,383 --> 01:27:42,302
...going back several years? Correct?

1274
01:27:42,385 --> 01:27:43,512
Yes, sir.

1275
01:27:43,762 --> 01:27:45,847
Were you able to find all those files?

1276
01:27:45,931 --> 01:27:47,933
No, sir. A file was missing.

1277
01:27:48,517 --> 01:27:50,894
This is the so-called B file...

1278
01:27:51,228 --> 01:27:53,730
...that was withheld
from you and Mr. Sabich...

1279
01:27:53,814 --> 01:27:57,275
...until Mr. Sabich requested it personally
from Mr. Horgan?

1280
01:27:57,567 --> 01:27:58,610
Yes, sir.

1281
01:27:58,693 --> 01:28:00,403
It involved allegations--

1282
01:28:00,487 --> 01:28:01,905
Let's move on.

1283
01:28:02,948 --> 01:28:06,535
You've been warned about riding off
in all directions.

1284
01:28:06,785 --> 01:28:08,328
No further questions.

1285
01:28:08,954 --> 01:28:10,789
No redirect, Your Honor.

1286
01:28:11,498 --> 01:28:14,376
We need subpoenas for Carolyn's doctors...

1287
01:28:14,668 --> 01:28:16,503
...and for phone company records...

1288
01:28:16,586 --> 01:28:18,463
...to check for errors.

1289
01:28:18,797 --> 01:28:21,341
I don't think we need to bother with that.

1290
01:28:22,217 --> 01:28:25,428
You said there was something wrong
with the phone records.

1291
01:28:25,512 --> 01:28:28,682
That you never called Polhemus
the night of the murder.

1292
01:28:31,309 --> 01:28:34,437
Jamie, I'd like a moment alone
with my client.

1293
01:28:37,774 --> 01:28:39,192
-Sure.
-Thanks.

1294
01:28:48,660 --> 01:28:51,705
I used to call Carolyn's apartment
after it was over.

1295
01:28:53,915 --> 01:28:55,292
I'd call...

1296
01:28:58,003 --> 01:28:59,546
...just to hear her voice.

1297
01:28:59,629 --> 01:29:01,923
Then I'd hang up, like a goddamn kid.

1298
01:29:05,093 --> 01:29:08,430
I'm not sure I called that night or not.
I don't remember.

1299
01:29:10,724 --> 01:29:14,895
Contrary to my original hopes,
we will have to present a defense.

1300
01:29:22,027 --> 01:29:23,695
My first instinct is...

1301
01:29:23,862 --> 01:29:25,822
...to put Barbara on the witness stand.

1302
01:29:25,906 --> 01:29:26,823
No.

1303
01:29:26,907 --> 01:29:30,410
She's an attractive woman
and there are five men in the jury.

1304
01:29:30,535 --> 01:29:33,455
She can also support your alibi
quite effectively.

1305
01:29:33,538 --> 01:29:35,373
It's not negotiable, Sandy.

1306
01:29:41,963 --> 01:29:43,757
When I was a prosecutor...

1307
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:48,094
...l always knew I had a winner
when the defendant refused to testify.

1308
01:29:49,805 --> 01:29:51,890
All I want to do is to tell the truth.

1309
01:29:51,973 --> 01:29:55,060
The jury wants to hear me say
I didn't do it.

1310
01:29:55,227 --> 01:29:57,521
And that, you will do very well.

1311
01:30:01,316 --> 01:30:05,237
But with every word, you will confirm
what the prosecution is saying.

1312
01:30:05,362 --> 01:30:07,906
That you were overwhelmed
with a sexual obsession...

1313
01:30:07,989 --> 01:30:11,827
...that took a wrong turn into rage
when she ended the affair.

1314
01:30:12,577 --> 01:30:16,998
You will have gone a long way
to eliminating the jury's reasonable doubt.

1315
01:30:18,041 --> 01:30:20,043
The State offers as evidence...

1316
01:30:20,544 --> 01:30:22,796
...from the defendant's suitcoat...

1317
01:30:22,921 --> 01:30:26,758
...a hair identified by the Police Crime Lab
as that of the deceased.

1318
01:30:26,842 --> 01:30:30,762
The skirt of the deceased contaminated
with fiber identified as Zorak V...

1319
01:30:30,846 --> 01:30:33,974
...a carpet fabric found
in the home of the defendant.

1320
01:30:34,724 --> 01:30:37,227
Chemist's identification of blood type...

1321
01:30:37,394 --> 01:30:40,856
...and semen from the vagina
of the deceased as type A.

1322
01:30:41,356 --> 01:30:44,067
Results of a blood test of Rozat Sabich...

1323
01:30:44,151 --> 01:30:46,570
...identifying his as blood type A.

1324
01:30:47,737 --> 01:30:51,867
The shirt of the deceased,
contaminated with the fiber Zorak V...

1325
01:30:52,659 --> 01:30:55,370
...carpet fabric used
in the defendant's home.

1326
01:30:59,583 --> 01:31:01,960
The State calls
Detective Morris Dickerman.

1327
01:31:02,043 --> 01:31:04,212
This relates to missing evidence.

1328
01:31:04,421 --> 01:31:06,590
I hope you're not considering
allowing them...

1329
01:31:06,673 --> 01:31:10,135
...to proceed with the fingerprint evidence
in the absence of the glass.

1330
01:31:10,218 --> 01:31:13,513
If so, we would like to be heard
on that question.

1331
01:31:14,097 --> 01:31:15,765
I understand that.

1332
01:31:16,141 --> 01:31:19,394
You may want to do some research
into this issue.

1333
01:31:20,103 --> 01:31:23,732
You hit the books tonight
and I'll listen to you tomorrow.

1334
01:31:24,608 --> 01:31:26,276
And if I were you...

1335
01:31:26,651 --> 01:31:30,405
...l'd roll up my shirtsleeves
and go to the Evidence Room...

1336
01:31:30,572 --> 01:31:32,491
...and find that glass.

1337
01:31:32,949 --> 01:31:35,619
You're not going to get any sleep again.

1338
01:31:35,744 --> 01:31:39,414
That glass is the strongest piece
of physical evidence that I was there.

1339
01:31:39,498 --> 01:31:44,544
If I can find solid precedents to keep it
out of evidence, their case will fail.

1340
01:31:48,256 --> 01:31:51,343
Get something to eat
and don't drink too much coffee.

1341
01:31:54,095 --> 01:31:55,305
Thanks.

1342
01:31:55,388 --> 01:31:56,556
For what?

1343
01:31:56,932 --> 01:31:58,600
For hanging in there.

1344
01:32:00,435 --> 01:32:01,978
What did you expect?

1345
01:32:16,493 --> 01:32:17,994
Yeah, just a sec.

1346
01:32:20,330 --> 01:32:21,665
It's your uncle.

1347
01:32:23,917 --> 01:32:25,085
My uncle?

1348
01:32:32,175 --> 01:32:35,178
We got something
on that very important matter.

1349
01:32:36,429 --> 01:32:38,390
I'm downstairs, in the lobby.

1350
01:32:39,766 --> 01:32:42,602
We're working to keep the glass
out of evidence.

1351
01:32:42,769 --> 01:32:44,938
Fuck the glass. I found Leon.

1352
01:32:45,147 --> 01:32:47,357
Feature this. He's a Night Saint.

1353
01:33:14,551 --> 01:33:15,552
Leon!

1354
01:33:17,137 --> 01:33:18,805
Answer the door.

1355
01:33:25,479 --> 01:33:27,731
Open up, Leon! It's the police!

1356
01:33:28,315 --> 01:33:30,233
We just want to talk, Leon.

1357
01:33:37,157 --> 01:33:38,408
On the floor!

1358
01:33:40,243 --> 01:33:42,913
-Don't even breathe!
-What the fuck you doing?

1359
01:33:47,083 --> 01:33:48,460
I'm Detective Lipranzer.

1360
01:33:48,543 --> 01:33:51,379
This is Mr. Sabich
from the prosecutor's office.

1361
01:33:51,505 --> 01:33:53,465
We have a few questions, Leon.

1362
01:33:53,632 --> 01:33:56,676
If you're straight with us,
we're gone in five minutes.

1363
01:33:56,760 --> 01:33:59,304
Five, six years ago,
you paid off a deputy PA...

1364
01:33:59,387 --> 01:34:02,557
...$1 ,500 to make some trouble
you had go away.

1365
01:34:03,141 --> 01:34:04,476
555-3469.

1366
01:34:05,602 --> 01:34:07,437
Jack Friedman, you ask for.

1367
01:34:11,942 --> 01:34:13,527
What the fuck he do that for?

1368
01:34:13,610 --> 01:34:16,112
He wants your complete attention.

1369
01:34:16,613 --> 01:34:21,284
Rusty Sabich is getting on the phone,
he will tell your present associates...

1370
01:34:21,368 --> 01:34:26,122
...that five years ago you paid off a PA
to get off a rap on molesting an officer.

1371
01:34:26,498 --> 01:34:27,541
To wit:

1372
01:34:27,874 --> 01:34:31,461
Trying to get paid to suck his cock
in a public place.

1373
01:34:32,671 --> 01:34:33,922
Now, Leon....

1374
01:34:35,465 --> 01:34:38,093
How about five minutes of your time?

1375
01:34:47,519 --> 01:34:49,354
This blonde bitch...

1376
01:34:50,730 --> 01:34:53,233
...my probation officer, set it up.

1377
01:34:54,818 --> 01:34:56,611
In the PA's office.

1378
01:34:57,696 --> 01:34:59,614
Man standing behind me.

1379
01:35:05,495 --> 01:35:07,998
And she be telling me, when I come in:

1380
01:35:09,332 --> 01:35:11,334
"Just don't turn around.

1381
01:35:12,669 --> 01:35:14,671
"Just do what the man say."

1382
01:35:17,299 --> 01:35:18,508
He said:

1383
01:35:22,012 --> 01:35:24,681
"Just leave the money in the top drawer."

1384
01:35:27,601 --> 01:35:29,644
Fifteen hundred dollars.

1385
01:35:31,021 --> 01:35:32,689
You never saw him?

1386
01:35:33,523 --> 01:35:35,525
But he knows who it was.

1387
01:35:44,159 --> 01:35:45,869
Judge Motherfucker.

1388
01:35:48,538 --> 01:35:50,540
That's what we all call him.

1389
01:35:54,169 --> 01:35:55,712
Larren Lyttle.

1390
01:35:58,465 --> 01:36:00,425
I bet Larren was porking her...

1391
01:36:00,509 --> 01:36:03,220
...and taking the money
to keep her in style.

1392
01:36:04,721 --> 01:36:06,848
Sometimes I hate being a cop.

1393
01:36:10,852 --> 01:36:14,105
Sorry, pal. You were counting
on it being Molto.

1394
01:36:19,486 --> 01:36:23,698
If you leak this stuff we got on him
to Larren, he might dismiss your case.

1395
01:36:29,371 --> 01:36:31,540
Okay, it was just a thought.

1396
01:36:34,125 --> 01:36:35,127
All rise!

1397
01:36:35,210 --> 01:36:38,380
This court is in session.
Judge Larren Lyttle presiding.

1398
01:36:45,137 --> 01:36:46,555
Where's Kemp?

1399
01:36:47,097 --> 01:36:51,893
We just received the medical examiner's
files on the reports from her doctors.

1400
01:36:52,060 --> 01:36:54,062
He's going over them right now.

1401
01:36:54,146 --> 01:36:57,399
We may have a surprise
in the medical testimony.

1402
01:37:00,068 --> 01:37:02,904
Mr. Molto, you have completed
your search?

1403
01:37:09,119 --> 01:37:10,579
Your Honor...

1404
01:37:10,787 --> 01:37:13,874
...the police have not been able
to locate the glass.

1405
01:37:14,124 --> 01:37:15,250
All right.

1406
01:37:15,750 --> 01:37:18,253
Mr. Stern, I have studied your arguments.

1407
01:37:18,795 --> 01:37:22,299
You are about to hear the testimony
of a fingerprint expert...

1408
01:37:22,424 --> 01:37:26,720
...concerning evidence that he claims
to have identified on a certain glass.

1409
01:37:27,721 --> 01:37:32,517
I am instructing you as a matter of law
that you are entitled to consider...

1410
01:37:32,809 --> 01:37:37,272
...the prosecution's failure to make
the glass available to the defense.

1411
01:37:37,606 --> 01:37:39,733
I am not telling you what to do.

1412
01:37:40,275 --> 01:37:42,944
But it is permissible
for that one fact alone...

1413
01:37:43,028 --> 01:37:47,574
...to raise a reasonable doubt
that would require Mr. Sabich's acquittal.

1414
01:37:48,909 --> 01:37:51,161
Mr. Stern's objection is overruled.

1415
01:37:51,870 --> 01:37:54,581
His exception is noted for the record.
Proceed.

1416
01:37:55,123 --> 01:37:56,249
I'm sorry.

1417
01:37:57,250 --> 01:37:59,127
He's right, under the law.

1418
01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:03,924
Based on the lateral slash
on the anterior portion of the fingerprint...

1419
01:38:04,216 --> 01:38:06,426
...the distinctive center whorl...

1420
01:38:06,802 --> 01:38:09,596
...and the exact match on the top swirl...

1421
01:38:10,597 --> 01:38:15,227
...l am certain the fingerprint on the glass
from Polhemus's apartment...

1422
01:38:16,102 --> 01:38:20,315
...is identical to that contained in
the employment file of Rozat K. Sabich.

1423
01:38:21,274 --> 01:38:22,359
Very good.

1424
01:38:23,652 --> 01:38:26,655
We are calling Dr. Kumagai,
the county coroner.

1425
01:38:26,988 --> 01:38:29,115
There are three depression fractures...

1426
01:38:29,199 --> 01:38:32,828
...like from a heavy, blunt instrument.
Maybe a hammer.

1427
01:38:33,495 --> 01:38:35,497
Here...here...and here.

1428
01:38:37,332 --> 01:38:39,251
This, and this over here, are...

1429
01:38:39,334 --> 01:38:42,838
...sharp, deep penetrations
of the skull and of the brain...

1430
01:38:42,963 --> 01:38:46,216
...like with a hatchet, or maybe
a meat cleaver.

1431
01:38:46,758 --> 01:38:51,012
I call to your attention the results
of the forensic chemist's analysis...

1432
01:38:51,471 --> 01:38:53,056
...State's exhibit 63.

1433
01:38:57,102 --> 01:38:59,771
I think we might just nail this sucker.

1434
01:38:59,980 --> 01:39:04,526
That report states the specimen of semen
taken from Ms. Polhemus's body...

1435
01:39:05,235 --> 01:39:09,072
...has been identified as being
of Mr. Sabich's blood type.

1436
01:39:09,281 --> 01:39:10,615
You are correct.

1437
01:39:11,032 --> 01:39:14,161
It also indicates the presence
of chemicals...

1438
01:39:14,494 --> 01:39:15,829
...consistent...

1439
01:39:15,996 --> 01:39:18,707
...with the use of a birth-control device.

1440
01:39:19,624 --> 01:39:20,917
A diaphragm.

1441
01:39:21,543 --> 01:39:22,627
It does.

1442
01:39:24,212 --> 01:39:26,381
Your opinion is that this was...

1443
01:39:26,798 --> 01:39:28,216
...a staged rape?

1444
01:39:28,300 --> 01:39:30,051
That is my opinion.

1445
01:39:30,886 --> 01:39:32,637
And the way it was done...

1446
01:39:32,804 --> 01:39:34,139
...suggests...

1447
01:39:35,056 --> 01:39:36,641
...the knowledge...

1448
01:39:37,017 --> 01:39:39,269
...of investigative techniques?

1449
01:39:40,270 --> 01:39:42,564
That's what I told Mr. Molto.

1450
01:39:43,732 --> 01:39:46,067
All of these deductions depend...

1451
01:39:46,485 --> 01:39:49,196
...on the presence of spermicidal jelly...

1452
01:39:49,488 --> 01:39:52,741
...in the specimen you sent
to the forensic chemist?

1453
01:39:52,866 --> 01:39:54,075
Yes, sir.

1454
01:39:55,452 --> 01:39:58,914
How many autopsies do you perform
in a week, Dr. Kumagai?

1455
01:39:59,998 --> 01:40:01,291
One, two...

1456
01:40:01,958 --> 01:40:03,668
...ten. It all depends.

1457
01:40:04,294 --> 01:40:08,131
Would it surprise you to know
you performed 1 8 autopsies...

1458
01:40:08,298 --> 01:40:11,593
...in the two weeks surrounding
Carolyn Polhemus's death?

1459
01:40:11,802 --> 01:40:12,928
No, sir.

1460
01:40:13,887 --> 01:40:15,555
Sounds about right.

1461
01:40:16,598 --> 01:40:19,768
Given that number,
isn't it fair to say that...

1462
01:40:20,227 --> 01:40:23,605
...the specifics of any one examination
may slip your mind?

1463
01:40:25,440 --> 01:40:27,943
I take notes while I do the autopsies.

1464
01:40:28,443 --> 01:40:29,736
Notes, yes.

1465
01:40:31,279 --> 01:40:34,074
These notes led you
to tell Detective Lipranzer...

1466
01:40:34,157 --> 01:40:36,284
...that the murderer was sterile?

1467
01:40:36,785 --> 01:40:39,579
Looking back, you must have thought
you were a fool...

1468
01:40:39,663 --> 01:40:44,292
...to have escaped something so obvious
as the use of a contraceptive spermicide.

1469
01:40:45,627 --> 01:40:47,671
All the sperm were dead.

1470
01:40:48,964 --> 01:40:53,468
I didn't have the forensic chemist's report
about the spermicidal jelly.

1471
01:40:53,635 --> 01:40:58,140
In the absence of any other explanation,
I thought the guy was sterile.

1472
01:41:00,642 --> 01:41:04,312
Do you recognize your notes
of your autopsy of Ms. Polhemus?

1473
01:41:06,857 --> 01:41:08,817
Yes, sir, my signature.

1474
01:41:13,822 --> 01:41:15,866
Unless there is any objection...

1475
01:41:15,949 --> 01:41:19,911
...would you please read the short passage
marked by the paper clips?

1476
01:41:20,996 --> 01:41:22,664
Page two, Counsel.

1477
01:41:23,331 --> 01:41:25,000
Read it out loud, please.

1478
01:41:25,083 --> 01:41:27,085
"The Fallopian tubes...

1479
01:41:27,294 --> 01:41:29,337
"...are ligated and separated.

1480
01:41:29,796 --> 01:41:32,132
"The fimbriated ends appear...."

1481
01:41:45,937 --> 01:41:47,522
That's not right.

1482
01:41:47,856 --> 01:41:49,399
Your own autopsy notes?

1483
01:41:49,483 --> 01:41:52,486
You dictate them
as you perform the procedure.

1484
01:41:57,574 --> 01:41:58,575
But not right.

1485
01:41:58,658 --> 01:42:02,245
I show you the records of Dr. Lubin,
a gynecologist...

1486
01:42:02,621 --> 01:42:06,917
...who performed this procedure
on Ms. Polhemus six and a half years ago.

1487
01:42:09,377 --> 01:42:13,006
Would you explain to the jury
what a "tubal ligation" is?

1488
01:42:18,428 --> 01:42:21,139
Would you explain, in layman's language...

1489
01:42:21,556 --> 01:42:23,558
...what a "tubal ligation" is?

1490
01:42:33,276 --> 01:42:35,278
She had her tubes tied.

1491
01:42:37,614 --> 01:42:41,535
Is it possible for a woman
with this procedure to conceive a child?

1492
01:42:42,953 --> 01:42:43,787
No way.

1493
01:42:43,870 --> 01:42:45,872
Can you think of any reason...

1494
01:42:46,289 --> 01:42:49,000
...for a woman who had her tubes tied...

1495
01:42:49,376 --> 01:42:51,169
...to use a spermicide?

1496
01:42:53,505 --> 01:42:54,881
No reason.

1497
01:42:55,715 --> 01:42:57,384
No medical reason.

1498
01:42:58,927 --> 01:43:00,053
I think of nothing.

1499
01:43:00,137 --> 01:43:02,889
Does it not follow, given these facts...

1500
01:43:03,056 --> 01:43:05,684
...that the specimen you sent
to the chemist...

1501
01:43:05,767 --> 01:43:08,854
...was not taken from the body
of Carolyn Polhemus?

1502
01:43:10,147 --> 01:43:12,149
I can't account for it.

1503
01:43:15,068 --> 01:43:17,154
So you don't know what happened.

1504
01:43:19,156 --> 01:43:22,284
Wherever you got
that specimen from, Doctor...

1505
01:43:23,243 --> 01:43:25,162
...you sent it to the chemist...

1506
01:43:25,245 --> 01:43:28,331
...while you were secretly communicating
with Mr. Molto...

1507
01:43:28,415 --> 01:43:30,417
...behind Mr. Sabich's back. Am I right?

1508
01:43:30,500 --> 01:43:32,752
Do you accuse me, Mr. Stern?

1509
01:43:34,004 --> 01:43:35,589
Sit down, Doctor.

1510
01:43:37,924 --> 01:43:39,801
I think we have had enough...

1511
01:43:39,885 --> 01:43:42,846
...unsupported accusations for one case...

1512
01:43:45,891 --> 01:43:47,434
...Dr. Kumagai.

1513
01:43:48,351 --> 01:43:50,145
You may step down, Doctor.

1514
01:43:50,896 --> 01:43:54,483
Do I take it, Mr. Delay Guardia,
that the State rests?

1515
01:43:59,112 --> 01:44:00,780
Judge, may we approach?

1516
01:44:08,246 --> 01:44:10,624
We would like Mr. Molto to testify.

1517
01:44:10,874 --> 01:44:11,875
No.

1518
01:44:11,958 --> 01:44:14,961
Judge, you said we would be entitled
to some leeway...

1519
01:44:15,045 --> 01:44:18,173
...if the defense proceeded
with this frame-up theory.

1520
01:44:18,256 --> 01:44:21,134
Yes, but I did not know then,
Mr. Della Guardia...

1521
01:44:21,259 --> 01:44:25,972
...that your evidence would disappear
after last being seen with Mr. Molto.

1522
01:44:26,097 --> 01:44:28,058
I didn't know that Mr. Molto...

1523
01:44:28,141 --> 01:44:31,269
...and the chief pathologist
would manufacture evidence...

1524
01:44:31,353 --> 01:44:32,938
...and testimony.

1525
01:44:33,021 --> 01:44:37,067
And I tell you, that is a fair interpretation
of the day's events.

1526
01:44:37,192 --> 01:44:40,529
I'm still considering the question
of what happens to Mr. Molto...

1527
01:44:40,612 --> 01:44:42,280
...but what isn't gonna happen...

1528
01:44:42,364 --> 01:44:45,617
...is him getting up on the witness stand
and making matters worse.

1529
01:44:45,700 --> 01:44:47,536
Withdraw, gentlemen.

1530
01:44:53,333 --> 01:44:56,628
On behalf of the people
of Kindle County, the State rests.

1531
01:44:57,629 --> 01:44:59,422
This court is adjourned.

1532
01:44:59,756 --> 01:45:03,885
You should savor today, Sandy.
No lawyer gets many crosses like that.

1533
01:45:04,052 --> 01:45:06,012
What a colossal blunder.

1534
01:45:07,389 --> 01:45:10,183
Tomorrow I will make the motion
for a dismissal.

1535
01:45:10,267 --> 01:45:14,479
If the dismissal is not granted,
we must proceed with the defense.

1536
01:45:16,189 --> 01:45:19,359
I need to know
if you still insist on testifying.

1537
01:45:21,027 --> 01:45:22,904
Of course, you know my strong objections.

1538
01:45:25,782 --> 01:45:28,368
Why is he so against your testifying?

1539
01:45:28,910 --> 01:45:32,622
He's afraid I'll tell the truth
about my relationship with Carolyn...

1540
01:45:32,706 --> 01:45:36,293
...thus giving the prosecution
the motive they've been lacking.

1541
01:45:37,461 --> 01:45:38,962
One could argue...

1542
01:45:40,088 --> 01:45:43,550
...if the jury feels I'm being truthful
about something so painful...

1543
01:45:43,633 --> 01:45:47,387
...they should believe me when I say
I didn't commit the murder.

1544
01:45:49,306 --> 01:45:50,891
What would you think?

1545
01:45:52,058 --> 01:45:54,227
If I were a member of the jury?

1546
01:45:58,815 --> 01:46:01,651
And I heard you admit
how much she meant to you?

1547
01:46:05,572 --> 01:46:07,991
I think I'd conclude you were guilty.

1548
01:46:12,829 --> 01:46:14,414
I want to testify.

1549
01:46:17,125 --> 01:46:18,752
What would you say?

1550
01:46:23,381 --> 01:46:26,092
I'd say you were the only man I ever loved.

1551
01:46:28,595 --> 01:46:30,096
And I still do.

1552
01:46:33,141 --> 01:46:36,186
Before we begin our presentation,
I would like to--

1553
01:46:36,311 --> 01:46:38,355
Make a motion for dismissal?

1554
01:46:38,814 --> 01:46:39,856
Yes, Your Honor.

1555
01:46:39,940 --> 01:46:41,650
Sit down, Counselor.

1556
01:46:46,571 --> 01:46:50,200
I have reflected on this case at length,
ladies and gentlemen.

1557
01:46:52,285 --> 01:46:53,787
I understand...

1558
01:46:53,995 --> 01:46:56,581
...the prosecutors have suspicions.

1559
01:46:58,291 --> 01:47:00,961
Perhaps Mr. Sabich was there that night.

1560
01:47:01,461 --> 01:47:03,672
The State might be granted that.

1561
01:47:03,880 --> 01:47:07,175
And if the prosecutors
had ever found that glass...

1562
01:47:07,801 --> 01:47:09,970
...l might be more convinced.

1563
01:47:10,303 --> 01:47:12,139
Maybe before yesterday...

1564
01:47:12,764 --> 01:47:17,018
...l might have said there were
reasonable grounds for those suspicions.

1565
01:47:17,185 --> 01:47:19,271
But now, I'm not so sure.

1566
01:47:22,315 --> 01:47:24,151
So after yesterday...

1567
01:47:24,818 --> 01:47:27,237
...there is no proof of motive here.

1568
01:47:27,529 --> 01:47:32,159
There is no concrete evidence that
there ever was an intimate relationship.

1569
01:47:32,784 --> 01:47:35,453
There is no effective proof,
so far as I am concerned...

1570
01:47:35,537 --> 01:47:39,332
...that would give a reasonable person
grounds to believe that...

1571
01:47:39,624 --> 01:47:44,588
...Mr. Sabich had carnal relations with
Ms. Polhemus on the night of her death.

1572
01:47:45,464 --> 01:47:46,965
In point of fact...

1573
01:47:47,174 --> 01:47:50,010
...there's not one shred of direct proof...

1574
01:47:50,260 --> 01:47:53,138
...that Mr. Sabich murdered Ms. Polhemus.

1575
01:47:55,682 --> 01:47:57,517
Under these circumstances...

1576
01:47:57,601 --> 01:48:00,103
...l cannot allow this trial to continue.

1577
01:48:01,688 --> 01:48:02,939
Mr. Sabich...

1578
01:48:04,107 --> 01:48:06,026
...you are discharged, sir.

1579
01:48:07,986 --> 01:48:11,072
I cannot begin to tell you how sorry I am...

1580
01:48:11,198 --> 01:48:13,533
...that any of this has taken place.

1581
01:48:15,035 --> 01:48:17,871
Not even the pleasure of seeing you free...

1582
01:48:18,038 --> 01:48:19,498
...can make up for this...

1583
01:48:19,581 --> 01:48:22,292
...this disgrace to the cause of justice.

1584
01:48:23,710 --> 01:48:25,545
I wish you Godspeed.

1585
01:48:27,798 --> 01:48:29,341
Case dismissed.

1586
01:48:42,312 --> 01:48:43,855
Hey, Rusty! Come on.

1587
01:48:44,231 --> 01:48:46,024
Give the missus a big hug.

1588
01:48:51,071 --> 01:48:54,199
Nobody can say anything adequate
at a time like this.

1589
01:48:54,282 --> 01:48:57,118
We're very grateful,
very pleased it's all over.

1590
01:48:57,869 --> 01:48:59,454
I want to go home, now.

1591
01:48:59,538 --> 01:49:02,207
I'll talk to Nat. I'll phone him, tell him.

1592
01:49:03,166 --> 01:49:06,461
For the record, I have the highest regard
for Rusty Sabich.

1593
01:49:06,545 --> 01:49:08,880
You think you're out of a job?

1594
01:49:11,716 --> 01:49:13,301
You're the very best.

1595
01:49:18,849 --> 01:49:22,185
How'd you know what was behind
Larren's fear of the B file?

1596
01:49:23,061 --> 01:49:25,522
You question the judge's integrity?

1597
01:49:26,356 --> 01:49:28,567
With just cause, wouldn't you say?

1598
01:49:29,025 --> 01:49:32,612
You knew that file didn't have
a damn thing to do with my case.

1599
01:49:33,029 --> 01:49:36,741
Yet you let Larren know you'd drag it in
at any opportunity.

1600
01:49:37,033 --> 01:49:39,494
That it would come out
that he was taking bribes.

1601
01:49:39,578 --> 01:49:41,705
That Carolyn was the courier.

1602
01:49:44,541 --> 01:49:46,376
You blackmailed him, Sandy.

1603
01:49:51,381 --> 01:49:53,049
We speak now tonight...

1604
01:49:54,926 --> 01:49:57,637
...and these things
are never spoken of again.

1605
01:49:59,055 --> 01:50:00,098
Agreed?

1606
01:50:04,227 --> 01:50:07,230
Larren's divorce left him
in a state of disorder.

1607
01:50:08,231 --> 01:50:13,111
He was drinking too heavily and fell
into a relationship with a beautiful, but...

1608
01:50:13,403 --> 01:50:15,071
...self-serving woman.

1609
01:50:16,907 --> 01:50:18,116
The fact is...

1610
01:50:18,200 --> 01:50:21,244
...Larren himself grew suicidally depressed.

1611
01:50:22,120 --> 01:50:24,581
He wanted to resign from the bench.

1612
01:50:24,790 --> 01:50:27,250
Raymond Horgan talked him out of it.

1613
01:50:27,584 --> 01:50:29,753
Raymond knew he was taking bribes?

1614
01:50:30,587 --> 01:50:32,255
Larren told him.

1615
01:50:34,257 --> 01:50:37,594
Raymond cleaned up the Northside,
as you recall...

1616
01:50:38,637 --> 01:50:41,473
...and he also rescued
a distinguished mind...

1617
01:50:41,640 --> 01:50:44,434
...and a career that does honor
to the bench.

1618
01:50:49,481 --> 01:50:52,943
I believe Larren today did
what he thought was just.

1619
01:50:55,445 --> 01:50:57,113
You tell me, Rusty.

1620
01:50:58,824 --> 01:51:00,492
Was justice done?

1621
01:51:10,168 --> 01:51:11,670
How are you doing?

1622
01:51:20,679 --> 01:51:22,264
Christmas present.

1623
01:51:36,486 --> 01:51:37,612
Jesus....

1624
01:51:40,532 --> 01:51:43,702
You're hanging your ass out
a good long way on this one.

1625
01:51:44,202 --> 01:51:46,204
It was them that fucked up.

1626
01:51:46,955 --> 01:51:50,292
Remember, they came around,
they grabbed all the evidence.

1627
01:51:50,625 --> 01:51:53,628
The glass wasn't there.
I took it down to Dickerman.

1628
01:51:54,588 --> 01:51:57,132
The very next day I get a call from the lab.

1629
01:51:57,215 --> 01:51:59,885
The test is done. I can pick up my glass.

1630
01:52:00,969 --> 01:52:05,557
When I went down there, Molto had signed
a receipt, "Returned to Evidence."

1631
01:52:06,141 --> 01:52:08,894
The idea was that I'll put it back in.

1632
01:52:09,644 --> 01:52:12,022
Only I got nowhere to put it...

1633
01:52:12,564 --> 01:52:15,317
...since it ain't my goddamn case anymore.

1634
01:52:17,152 --> 01:52:19,404
So I tossed the thing in my drawer.

1635
01:52:20,071 --> 01:52:23,158
I figured, sooner or later
somebody's got to ask me.

1636
01:52:24,576 --> 01:52:25,827
Nobody did.

1637
01:52:26,828 --> 01:52:28,497
You think I killed her.

1638
01:52:31,583 --> 01:52:33,335
The lady was bad news.

1639
01:52:38,006 --> 01:52:40,091
That makes it okay I killed her?

1640
01:52:40,175 --> 01:52:41,468
Did you?

1641
01:52:44,054 --> 01:52:45,180
Oh, pal.

1642
01:53:08,620 --> 01:53:09,496
Nat!

1643
01:53:10,622 --> 01:53:11,957
Where's Mom?

1644
01:53:12,124 --> 01:53:14,709
Upstairs in the bathroom
throwing up when I saw her.

1645
01:53:14,793 --> 01:53:17,129
She's got her university interview today.

1646
01:53:17,212 --> 01:53:18,547
What's the big deal?

1647
01:53:18,630 --> 01:53:20,298
No eggs for me, thank you.

1648
01:53:20,382 --> 01:53:21,716
That looks nice.

1649
01:53:21,800 --> 01:53:22,968
You think?

1650
01:53:23,301 --> 01:53:26,805
That dumb old college would be lucky
to have you teaching there.

1651
01:53:26,888 --> 01:53:28,306
You tell her, kid.

1652
01:53:29,224 --> 01:53:32,435
I'll do some work around the house
while I still have time.

1653
01:53:32,519 --> 01:53:34,146
I've lived to see the day.

1654
01:53:34,229 --> 01:53:36,731
Give me a hand with the fence
when you get home.

1655
01:53:36,815 --> 01:53:38,650
I can't. I got a game after school.

1656
01:53:38,733 --> 01:53:40,026
Good luck, Mom.

1657
01:53:49,161 --> 01:53:50,579
Go get them, kid.

1658
01:55:53,952 --> 01:55:55,287
I did it.

1659
01:56:02,002 --> 01:56:03,753
I fooled them all.

1660
01:56:06,965 --> 01:56:08,341
The interview.

1661
01:56:09,593 --> 01:56:11,678
They think I'm qualified.

1662
01:57:18,161 --> 01:57:20,831
You understand what happened
had to happen.

1663
01:57:22,958 --> 01:57:25,502
It couldn't have turned out any other way.

1664
01:57:28,463 --> 01:57:30,382
A woman's depressed...

1665
01:57:32,384 --> 01:57:33,844
...with herself...

1666
01:57:35,011 --> 01:57:36,429
...with life...

1667
01:57:38,181 --> 01:57:42,018
...with her husband, who had made life
possible for her until he was...

1668
01:57:42,102 --> 01:57:44,396
...bewitched by another woman.

1669
01:57:46,189 --> 01:57:47,649
A destroyer.

1670
01:57:52,779 --> 01:57:54,239
Abandoned...

1671
01:57:57,450 --> 01:57:59,619
...like someone left for dead...

1672
01:58:01,371 --> 01:58:03,457
...she plans her suicide.

1673
01:58:07,043 --> 01:58:09,045
Until the dream begins.

1674
01:58:11,089 --> 01:58:13,884
In the dream, the destroyer's destroyed.

1675
01:58:15,302 --> 01:58:17,471
That's a dream worth living for.

1676
01:58:22,476 --> 01:58:24,519
Now, with such simplicity...

1677
01:58:28,315 --> 01:58:31,443
...such clarity, everything falls into place.

1678
01:58:35,071 --> 01:58:36,948
It must be a crime...

1679
01:58:37,365 --> 01:58:41,828
...that her husband can declare unsolved
and be believed by all the world.

1680
01:58:42,871 --> 01:58:45,248
She must make it look like a rape.

1681
01:58:46,875 --> 01:58:49,586
But she must leave her husband clueless.

1682
01:58:50,086 --> 01:58:52,464
Once he discovers who it was...

1683
01:58:53,882 --> 01:58:57,344
...he'll put the case into the file
of the unsolved murders.

1684
01:58:59,137 --> 01:59:01,139
Another break-in by some...

1685
01:59:01,681 --> 01:59:03,350
...sex-crazed man.

1686
01:59:08,480 --> 01:59:10,023
But all his life...

1687
01:59:11,650 --> 01:59:13,777
...he'll know that it was her.

1688
01:59:18,740 --> 01:59:21,618
She remembers a set of glasses
she bought for the woman...

1689
01:59:21,701 --> 01:59:26,331
...some time before, a housewarming gift
from her husband and his office.

1690
01:59:26,832 --> 01:59:28,625
She buys another set.

1691
01:59:29,960 --> 01:59:32,546
Her husband has a beer one night...

1692
01:59:34,840 --> 01:59:37,175
...doesn't even comment on the glass.

1693
01:59:38,343 --> 01:59:40,303
Now she has his fingerprints.

1694
01:59:44,850 --> 01:59:46,935
Then on a few mornings...

1695
01:59:48,478 --> 01:59:52,566
...she saves the fluid that comes out
when she removes her diaphragm.

1696
01:59:59,156 --> 02:00:01,158
Puts it in a plastic bag.

1697
02:00:02,701 --> 02:00:05,120
Puts the bag in the basement freezer...

1698
02:00:06,371 --> 02:00:07,664
...and waits.

1699
02:00:10,584 --> 02:00:13,253
She calls the woman and asks to see her.

1700
02:00:14,045 --> 02:00:17,132
Stops first at the U
and logs onto the computer.

1701
02:00:17,424 --> 02:00:19,342
Now she has her alibi.

1702
02:00:21,845 --> 02:00:23,763
She goes to the woman.

1703
02:00:24,681 --> 02:00:26,600
The woman lets her in.

1704
02:00:27,684 --> 02:00:32,272
When her head is turned, she removes
the instrument from her bag and strikes.

1705
02:00:34,858 --> 02:00:36,776
The destroyer is destroyed.

1706
02:00:40,405 --> 02:00:42,407
She takes a cord out...

1707
02:00:44,409 --> 02:00:46,453
...that she brought along...

1708
02:00:48,663 --> 02:00:50,457
...and ties her body...

1709
02:00:51,041 --> 02:00:54,044
...in ways her husband described
perverts do.

1710
02:00:57,130 --> 02:00:58,882
She feels power...

1711
02:01:00,884 --> 02:01:02,302
...control...

1712
02:01:04,221 --> 02:01:07,599
...a sense that she's guided
by a force beyond herself.

1713
02:01:10,685 --> 02:01:14,648
Takes a syringe and injects
the contents of the Ziploc bag...

1714
02:01:16,358 --> 02:01:18,527
...leaves the glass on the bar...

1715
02:01:19,611 --> 02:01:22,030
...unlocks the door and windows...

1716
02:01:24,407 --> 02:01:25,826
...and goes home.

1717
02:01:30,038 --> 02:01:31,957
And life begins again.

1718
02:01:38,713 --> 02:01:40,215
Until a trial...

1719
02:01:43,343 --> 02:01:45,720
...when she sees her husband suffer...

1720
02:01:47,055 --> 02:01:48,723
...the way she never...

1721
02:01:49,808 --> 02:01:51,101
...intended.

1722
02:01:53,895 --> 02:01:56,064
She is prepared to tell the truth.

1723
02:01:57,357 --> 02:01:59,192
Right up to the very end.

1724
02:02:02,863 --> 02:02:04,197
But magically...

1725
02:02:06,992 --> 02:02:08,994
...the charges were dismissed.

1726
02:02:12,497 --> 02:02:14,332
The suffering was over.

1727
02:02:17,210 --> 02:02:18,753
They were saved.

1728
02:02:25,260 --> 02:02:26,386
Saved?

1729
02:02:35,896 --> 02:02:38,315
The murder of Carolyn Polhemus...

1730
02:02:38,940 --> 02:02:40,775
...remains unsolved.

1731
02:02:43,028 --> 02:02:47,449
It is a practical impossibility
to try two people for the same crime.

1732
02:02:49,785 --> 02:02:51,620
Even if it wasn't...

1733
02:02:52,996 --> 02:02:55,916
...l couldn't take his mother from my son.

1734
02:02:58,502 --> 02:03:00,212
I'm a prosecutor.

1735
02:03:00,587 --> 02:03:03,840
I have spent my life
in the assignment of blame.

1736
02:03:06,009 --> 02:03:08,595
With all deliberation and intent...

1737
02:03:09,304 --> 02:03:11,389
...l reached for Carolyn.

1738
02:03:12,098 --> 02:03:14,351
I cannot pretend it was an accident.

1739
02:03:16,561 --> 02:03:18,021
I reached for Carolyn...

1740
02:03:18,104 --> 02:03:21,566
...and set off that insane mix
of rage and lunacy...

1741
02:03:23,652 --> 02:03:26,279
...that led one human being to kill another.

1742
02:03:29,366 --> 02:03:30,784
There was a crime.

1743
02:03:32,828 --> 02:03:34,454
There was a victim.

1744
02:03:36,957 --> 02:03:38,792
And there is punishment.
