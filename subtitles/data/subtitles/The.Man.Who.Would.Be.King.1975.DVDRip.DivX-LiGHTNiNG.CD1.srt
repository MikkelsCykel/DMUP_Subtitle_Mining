1
00:04:13,284 --> 00:04:15,703
I've come back.

2
00:04:19,665 --> 00:04:23,586
Give me a drink, Brother Kipling.

3
00:04:30,176 --> 00:04:32,845
Don't you know me?

4
00:04:33,012 --> 00:04:36,849
No. I don't know you.

5
00:04:38,184 --> 00:04:40,144
Who are you?

6
00:04:41,103 --> 00:04:42,813
What can I do for you?

7
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:46,776
I told you. Give me a drink.

8
00:05:19,392 --> 00:05:24,814
It was all settled.
Right here, in this office.

9
00:05:26,858 --> 00:05:28,568
Remember?

10
00:05:28,734 --> 00:05:34,657
Danny and me signed the contract
and you witnessed it.

11
00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:36,617
You...

12
00:05:38,452 --> 00:05:40,538
...stood over there.

13
00:05:42,748 --> 00:05:44,792
I stood there.

14
00:05:45,251 --> 00:05:48,087
And Daniel stood here.

15
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:51,382
Remember?

16
00:05:53,342 --> 00:05:54,927
Carnehan!

17
00:05:57,388 --> 00:06:01,559
Peachy Taliaferro Carnehan.

18
00:06:01,726 --> 00:06:03,686
Of course.

19
00:06:03,895 --> 00:06:09,317
Keep looking at me. It helps
to keep my soul from flying off.

20
00:06:09,483 --> 00:06:11,194
Carnehan!

21
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,822
The same, and not the same,
who sat beside you...

22
00:06:14,989 --> 00:06:19,285
...in a first-class carriage
on the train to Marwar Junction...

23
00:06:19,493 --> 00:06:23,956
...three summers
and a thousand years ago.

24
00:06:32,965 --> 00:06:35,134
Jodhpur, please.

25
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,865
Blast!

26
00:07:17,176 --> 00:07:19,470
All aboard!

27
00:08:38,591 --> 00:08:40,259
May I?

28
00:08:40,927 --> 00:08:46,891
Riding in this ashcart is like being
kicked by a mule every 10 minutes!

29
00:09:11,624 --> 00:09:13,668
Mr. Clutterbury Das.

30
00:09:13,835 --> 00:09:18,589
Failed entrance examination,
Calcutta University, 1863.

31
00:09:18,756 --> 00:09:22,760
Writer of correspondence
for the illiterate general public.

32
00:09:22,927 --> 00:09:24,220
Shut up!

33
00:09:24,387 --> 00:09:26,097
Thank you, sir.

34
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:20,818
- Out of the window, Babu!
- Thank you, sir.

35
00:10:21,986 --> 00:10:24,822
Outside, you inky-fingered thief!

36
00:10:24,989 --> 00:10:28,075
- I hope you break your neck!
- Thank you, sir.

37
00:10:28,242 --> 00:10:32,079
- You might have killed him!
- Serves him right if I had!

38
00:10:32,371 --> 00:10:36,751
- We're not making five miles an hour.
- But why?

39
00:10:38,419 --> 00:10:42,965
- I caught him stealing your watch.
- My watch?

40
00:10:44,008 --> 00:10:46,511
I say, it is my watch!

41
00:10:47,762 --> 00:10:49,388
Well!

42
00:10:51,224 --> 00:10:54,227
I'm very much obliged to you, Mr...?

43
00:10:55,228 --> 00:10:59,440
Carnehan. Former gunnery sergeant
in Her Majesty's Forces.

44
00:10:59,607 --> 00:11:01,067
Mine's Kipling.

45
00:11:01,442 --> 00:11:05,238
- May I offer you a drink?
- I don't mind if I do.

46
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:13,871
You've knocked about India a bit,
I take it.

47
00:11:14,038 --> 00:11:18,626
You can say that twice!
On foot, on horseback and on camel.

48
00:11:18,793 --> 00:11:22,296
- You don't look green, either.
- I was born in India.

49
00:11:22,463 --> 00:11:27,301
Great country, or was till bureaucrats
took over and ruined everything.

50
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:30,096
- I hope you're not one of them!
- No.

51
00:11:30,263 --> 00:11:31,556
I didn't think so.

52
00:11:31,722 --> 00:11:35,309
They usually have long noses
for looking down at you.

53
00:11:35,476 --> 00:11:38,855
And I've yet to have
one of them offer me a drink!

54
00:11:40,398 --> 00:11:43,901
- Glenlivet, 12 years old.
- You've an educated taste.

55
00:11:44,068 --> 00:11:48,322
I have an educated taste in whiskey,
women, waistcoats and bills of fare.

56
00:11:48,489 --> 00:11:51,200
But I've had few chances
to exercise it.

57
00:11:51,367 --> 00:11:54,328
Because them that governs
make up laws...

58
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:57,373
...to stop men like us
from getting anywhere.

59
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:00,293
Whose loss is it?
England's, of course!

60
00:12:00,459 --> 00:12:05,006
If we were unrestrained, she wouldn't
get 70 millions in revenue...

61
00:12:05,173 --> 00:12:09,760
- ... it would be 700 millions! Right?
- I quite agree, yes.

62
00:12:10,136 --> 00:12:13,306
- Where are you heading for?
- Jodhpur.

63
00:12:13,472 --> 00:12:16,642
- Will you return on this line?
- In 10 days.

64
00:12:16,809 --> 00:12:20,354
Can you make it eight?
I have a message for a man...

65
00:12:20,521 --> 00:12:23,858
...travelling through Marwar Junction
on the 24th.

66
00:12:24,025 --> 00:12:27,153
He expects to meet
but I have urgent business.

67
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,906
I'm sorry, I can't help you there.

68
00:12:30,072 --> 00:12:32,575
Supposing I was to ask you...

69
00:12:32,742 --> 00:12:37,371
...as a stranger going to the West
to seek for that which was lost.

70
00:12:37,538 --> 00:12:39,874
What would you say then?

71
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:42,835
I should answer,
where do you come from?

72
00:12:43,002 --> 00:12:44,045
From the East.

73
00:12:44,212 --> 00:12:48,132
I am hoping that you will give
my message on the square...

74
00:12:48,299 --> 00:12:50,676
...for the sake of the widow's son.

75
00:12:51,594 --> 00:12:56,474
- Which lodge do you hail from?
- Travelling Lodge 3276, Fore and Fit.

76
00:12:56,641 --> 00:13:01,312
The Queen's Own Royal Loyal Light
Infantry, Regimental District 329A.

77
00:13:01,812 --> 00:13:04,482
- To whom is the message?
- Daniel Dravot.

78
00:13:04,649 --> 00:13:07,860
- Dravot.
- A big man with long gray sideboards.

79
00:13:08,027 --> 00:13:09,111
A great swell.

80
00:13:09,278 --> 00:13:12,823
You'll find him
in a first-class compartment.

81
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:14,200
Don't be afraid.

82
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:19,080
Slip the window down and say,
" Peachy's gone south for the week. "

83
00:13:19,372 --> 00:13:23,626
- " Peachy's gone south for the week. "
- Yes, and he'll tumble.

84
00:13:23,793 --> 00:13:28,631
Well, I'll be getting off now
before we reach the station.

85
00:13:31,634 --> 00:13:34,428
By the way, Brother Carnehan...

86
00:13:35,221 --> 00:13:38,641
I missed my watch
in the station at Lahore...

87
00:13:38,808 --> 00:13:41,519
...before boarding the train.

88
00:13:41,686 --> 00:13:45,022
How was I to know you were a Mason?

89
00:14:11,424 --> 00:14:13,176
What's this?

90
00:14:13,342 --> 00:14:16,012
God's holy trousers!
Tickets again?

91
00:14:16,179 --> 00:14:18,389
Is your name Dravot, sir?

92
00:14:21,684 --> 00:14:27,315
I'm to say that Peachy
has gone south for the week.

93
00:14:33,529 --> 00:14:35,865
He's gone south for the week.

94
00:14:36,032 --> 00:14:39,368
Did he say I'd give anything for this?
I won't.

95
00:14:39,535 --> 00:14:42,205
- No, he didn't.
- Then why did you do it?

96
00:14:42,371 --> 00:14:45,416
For the sake of the widow's son.

97
00:14:48,294 --> 00:14:50,671
- He said south, did he?
- Yes.

98
00:14:50,838 --> 00:14:53,216
Then that'll be Degumber.

99
00:14:53,382 --> 00:14:56,135
Since you're Peachy's pal,
I'll tell you.

100
00:14:56,302 --> 00:15:01,474
We're gonna put the screw on the rajah
for what he did to his mother-in-law.

101
00:15:01,641 --> 00:15:05,102
Filled her with peppers
and flogged her to death.

102
00:15:05,978 --> 00:15:08,564
You mean you intend to blackmail him?

103
00:15:08,731 --> 00:15:14,320
You wouldn't get out alive! If they
don't cut your throat, they'll poison you.

104
00:15:14,487 --> 00:15:17,865
Both's been tried.
Peachy and me don't kill easy!

105
00:15:18,032 --> 00:15:21,744
The rajah's an independent ruler.
He answers to nobody.

106
00:15:21,911 --> 00:15:24,372
How will you put the screw on him?

107
00:15:24,539 --> 00:15:28,501
By telling him we're correspondents
for The Northern Star.

108
00:15:28,668 --> 00:15:32,713
You can't! You can't do that!

109
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:37,260
Because I am the correspondent
of The Northern Star!

110
00:15:37,718 --> 00:15:42,014
- You what?
- I'm the correspondent!

111
00:15:42,181 --> 00:15:45,601
Eh? What did you say, brother?

112
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:54,944
As you know,
we took them at the Degumber border...

113
00:15:55,111 --> 00:15:58,197
...so there's a question
of jurisdiction.

114
00:15:58,364 --> 00:16:02,201
But a charge of conspiracy
to blackmail might be brought.

115
00:16:02,368 --> 00:16:07,039
I didn't lay this information before
you as a criminal prosecution.

116
00:16:07,206 --> 00:16:09,250
Only to save their lives.

117
00:16:09,417 --> 00:16:13,754
May I ask what particular interest
you have in these scoundrels?

118
00:16:13,921 --> 00:16:17,633
Well, they happen to be...

119
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,927
...Freemasons. Like myself.

120
00:16:20,094 --> 00:16:24,307
Freemasons? Them? I'd think
you'd strike them off your roll!

121
00:16:24,473 --> 00:16:27,185
Oh, once a Mason, always a Mason.

122
00:16:27,351 --> 00:16:32,690
Never could understand how
pukka chaps like you can go about...

123
00:16:32,857 --> 00:16:37,320
...wearing aprons and sashes
and shaking hands with strangers.

124
00:16:37,695 --> 00:16:39,530
What is Masonry, Kipling?

125
00:16:39,697 --> 00:16:41,490
It's an ancient order...

126
00:16:41,657 --> 00:16:46,037
...dedicated to the brotherhood
of man, under the eye of God.

127
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:51,000
We should have left that behind
in England. It can never work here.

128
00:16:51,167 --> 00:16:55,004
There are tales that it did work here,
before we came.

129
00:16:55,171 --> 00:16:57,924
Some audacious scholars
can trace it...

130
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:00,718
...to the builders
of Solomon's Temple.

131
00:17:00,885 --> 00:17:06,933
- Old wives' tales, I suspect.
- Yes, in all likelihood, sir.

132
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:12,897
Well, let's have a look
at your lodge brothers.

133
00:17:17,235 --> 00:17:20,071
Right turn.

134
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,701
Halt.

135
00:17:26,118 --> 00:17:27,828
Hats off!

136
00:17:29,372 --> 00:17:31,749
You men are not under arrest...

137
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:37,296
...thanks to Mr. Kipling, who's a real
correspondent for The Northern Star.

138
00:17:37,505 --> 00:17:41,717
But both of you richly deserve
to be in jail.

139
00:17:42,051 --> 00:17:44,554
I have your records before me.

140
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,099
There's everything
from smuggling to swindling...

141
00:17:48,266 --> 00:17:51,727
...receiving stolen goods
and barefaced blackmail!

142
00:17:51,894 --> 00:17:53,980
I resent the accusation.

143
00:17:54,146 --> 00:17:57,942
It is blackmail to threaten
to publish information.

144
00:17:58,109 --> 00:18:02,405
What blackmail is there in accepting
a retainer to keep it out?

145
00:18:02,572 --> 00:18:04,824
How did you propose to do that?

146
00:18:04,991 --> 00:18:08,786
Telling the editor what I know
about his sister...

147
00:18:08,953 --> 00:18:11,706
...and a certain government official.

148
00:18:11,873 --> 00:18:16,169
Let him put that in his paper
if he has need of news!

149
00:18:20,006 --> 00:18:23,426
You should have gone home
after your army service.

150
00:18:23,593 --> 00:18:26,929
To what? A porter's uniform
outside a restaurant?

151
00:18:27,096 --> 00:18:31,392
Tips for closing cab doors
on civilians and their blowzy women?

152
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:34,937
Not for us, after watching
Afghans take command...

153
00:18:35,104 --> 00:18:38,566
- ... when the officers had copped it!
- Well said!

154
00:18:38,733 --> 00:18:44,155
There may be no criminal charges, but
I'll see these files reach Calcutta...

155
00:18:44,322 --> 00:18:48,492
...with the advice you be
deported as political undesirables.

156
00:18:48,659 --> 00:18:51,495
Detriments to the empire and the raj.

157
00:18:51,662 --> 00:18:54,207
Detriments you call us? Detriments?

158
00:18:54,373 --> 00:19:00,171
Detriments like us built this bloody
empire and the izzat of the raj!

159
00:19:00,379 --> 00:19:02,256
Hats on!

160
00:19:02,632 --> 00:19:04,509
About turn!

161
00:19:04,926 --> 00:19:07,845
By the left, quick march!

162
00:19:08,596 --> 00:19:11,682
Left turn!

163
00:19:16,479 --> 00:19:22,026
There's no need to let any of this
get into the Star, I take it, Kipling?

164
00:19:22,193 --> 00:19:24,111
No, no, no.

165
00:19:29,575 --> 00:19:31,160
Copy.

166
00:20:01,732 --> 00:20:05,736
My God! You two!
What do you want this time?

167
00:20:05,903 --> 00:20:09,699
- We want to ask you a favour.
- Another favour?

168
00:20:09,866 --> 00:20:14,328
Calm down, we've never taken
advantage of a fellow in the craft.

169
00:20:14,495 --> 00:20:17,331
We don't want money,
just a little time...

170
00:20:17,498 --> 00:20:20,835
...a look at a book or two,
a study of your maps.

171
00:20:21,002 --> 00:20:24,172
We'll take a drink, but if not,
we won't mind.

172
00:20:24,338 --> 00:20:28,551
Peachy is as sober as I am.
It's important you have no doubts.

173
00:20:28,801 --> 00:20:35,391
So we'll take one of your cigars
apiece, and you shall watch us...

174
00:20:35,558 --> 00:20:37,310
...light up.

175
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,197
And now, sir...

176
00:20:49,363 --> 00:20:54,327
...let me introduce you to Brother
Peachy Carnehan, which is him...

177
00:20:54,493 --> 00:20:59,207
...and Brother Daniel Dravot,
which is I.

178
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:04,253
The less said about our jobs,
the better. We've been most things.

179
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:09,467
We've been all over India. We know
her cities, jungles, jails and passes.

180
00:21:09,634 --> 00:21:12,887
We have decided
she isn't big enough for us.

181
00:21:13,054 --> 00:21:15,139
The commissioner said that.

182
00:21:15,306 --> 00:21:17,391
We're going to another place...

183
00:21:17,558 --> 00:21:21,270
...where a man isn't crowded
and can come into his own.

184
00:21:21,437 --> 00:21:25,107
We're not little men,
so we're going away to be kings.

185
00:21:25,483 --> 00:21:29,111
- Kings of Kafiristan.
- Oh, Kafiristan.

186
00:21:29,278 --> 00:21:34,116
We hear they have two and 30 idols
there. So we'll be the 33rd and 34th.

187
00:21:34,617 --> 00:21:39,121
It's a place of warring tribes,
meaning a land of opportunity...

188
00:21:39,288 --> 00:21:42,667
...for such who can train
and lead men in battle.

189
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:45,837
We'll go there
and say to any chief we find:

190
00:21:46,003 --> 00:21:50,174
"Want to vanquish your foes?"
He'll say, "Of course, do it. "

191
00:21:50,341 --> 00:21:54,136
We'll fight for him, make him king
and then subvert him.

192
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:58,182
We'll seize his royal throne
and loot the country.

193
00:21:58,391 --> 00:22:00,977
How's that for a plan?

194
00:22:01,853 --> 00:22:04,605
You're both out of your minds!

195
00:22:06,774 --> 00:22:08,860
To start with...

196
00:22:09,777 --> 00:22:14,782
...the only way to get there
is through Afghanistan.

197
00:22:15,449 --> 00:22:18,202
Kafiristan? No, no, no.

198
00:22:18,369 --> 00:22:24,500
Two white men would be cut to pieces
five miles into the Khyber Pass.

199
00:22:24,667 --> 00:22:28,087
Just suppose we managed it.
Just suppose.

200
00:22:28,254 --> 00:22:32,008
And suppose we got across
the Afghan plains, then what?

201
00:22:32,175 --> 00:22:37,889
There's the Hindu Kush,
a frozen sea of peaks and glaciers.

202
00:22:38,055 --> 00:22:43,186
A party of geographers tried several
years ago and vanished into thin air.

203
00:22:43,352 --> 00:22:47,940
No white man has ever been there
and come out since Alexander.

204
00:22:48,107 --> 00:22:50,067
Alexander who?

205
00:22:50,234 --> 00:22:54,447
Alexander the Great, king of Greece.
300 years before Christ.

206
00:22:54,614 --> 00:22:57,533
If a Greek can do it, we can do it.

207
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,118
Right.

208
00:23:00,244 --> 00:23:04,332
I can only repeat,
you're a pair of lunatics!

209
00:23:04,498 --> 00:23:09,253
Would a pair of lunatics
draw up a contract like this?

210
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:15,760
"This contract between us, pursuing
and witnesseth in the name of God.

211
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:20,806
One: We will settle this together,
i. e., to be kings of Kafiristan.

212
00:23:20,973 --> 00:23:25,311
Two: We will not, while this
is being settled, look at liquor...

213
00:23:25,478 --> 00:23:30,149
...or any woman, so as to get mixed
up with one or the other harmful.

214
00:23:30,316 --> 00:23:33,194
Three: We act
with dignity and discretion.

215
00:23:33,361 --> 00:23:38,241
If one is in trouble, the other stays
by him. Signed by us this day. "

216
00:23:38,407 --> 00:23:42,828
There's no need for the last article,
but it's got a ring to it.

217
00:23:43,496 --> 00:23:45,039
Daniel.

218
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:21,117
Now, you witness it and it's legal.

219
00:24:37,049 --> 00:24:41,220
Well, gentlemen,
it's 4 in the morning.

220
00:24:41,387 --> 00:24:47,393
Don't stand on politeness. If you want
to go to bed, we won't steal anything.

221
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,686
Thank you.

222
00:24:48,853 --> 00:24:53,691
We'll send word when we're ready
to go, if you want to say goodbye.

223
00:24:53,858 --> 00:24:58,070
Yes. Well, try not to burn
the place down.

224
00:25:02,366 --> 00:25:04,243
Here we are.

225
00:25:05,203 --> 00:25:09,916
" Kafiristan. 10,000 square miles.
Mountainous terrain.

226
00:25:10,082 --> 00:25:13,085
Religion unknown. Population unknown.

227
00:25:13,252 --> 00:25:17,173
Conquered by Alexander in 328 B.C.

228
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:23,095
According to Herodotus,
he defeated King Oxyartes...

229
00:25:23,262 --> 00:25:29,185
...whose daughter Roxanne
he subsequently took to wife. "

230
00:25:38,528 --> 00:25:41,155
You buy from me,
I give you good price.

231
00:25:41,322 --> 00:25:45,701
Very cheap, very nice things for you,
especially for you, sir.

232
00:26:03,845 --> 00:26:08,474
Our forward continuance is impeded
by this fellow, who is begging...

233
00:26:08,641 --> 00:26:13,688
...you will accompany him that he may
show you a rare and wonderful thing.

234
00:26:13,855 --> 00:26:16,983
- What thing?
- He would not say what thing.

235
00:26:17,149 --> 00:26:20,278
Therefore, I suspect
his bad intentions...

236
00:26:20,444 --> 00:26:23,823
...to entice you into
a house of disreputation...

237
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:27,368
...where he will take you,
kill you, murder you...

238
00:26:27,535 --> 00:26:31,622
...cut your throat and rob the money
from your pockets also.

239
00:26:31,789 --> 00:26:33,416
Crikey!

240
00:26:33,583 --> 00:26:36,127
- Wait at the office!
- Sir, please!

241
00:26:36,294 --> 00:26:39,463
Myself, I will take you
to a loving house.

242
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:42,592
You will be very happy
and delightful...

243
00:27:10,995 --> 00:27:12,997
Morning to you, brother.

244
00:27:13,164 --> 00:27:16,626
Glad you caught the performance.
What do you think?

245
00:27:16,792 --> 00:27:20,505
It's convincing,
but what are you rascals up to now?

246
00:27:20,671 --> 00:27:24,592
Last week it was kings
you were to be, of Kafiristan.

247
00:27:24,759 --> 00:27:29,138
- We've gotta get there first.
- Madness is a trick.

248
00:27:29,305 --> 00:27:32,767
Who'd hurt some poor crazy priest
and his servant?

249
00:27:32,934 --> 00:27:36,145
Peachy worked this out.
We've used it before.

250
00:27:36,312 --> 00:27:38,314
He talks, while I act dumb.

251
00:27:38,481 --> 00:27:40,525
I can clown pretty good now.

252
00:27:40,691 --> 00:27:43,945
I can twitch to put the fear
into any good Muslim.

253
00:27:44,111 --> 00:27:46,697
I can froth at the mouth.
Want to see?

254
00:27:46,864 --> 00:27:50,618
- I can imagine.
- All right, some other time perhaps.

255
00:27:50,952 --> 00:27:52,954
Come over here.

256
00:27:57,625 --> 00:28:00,753
Give it a touch-up down here.

257
00:28:03,422 --> 00:28:06,884
- Rifles?
- Twenty Martinis, and ammunition.

258
00:28:07,051 --> 00:28:10,721
Cost us every sou we got
out of the rajah of Degumber.

259
00:28:10,888 --> 00:28:14,225
Good heavens!
You mean you went back there?

260
00:28:14,392 --> 00:28:16,269
Of course, Brother Kipling.

261
00:28:16,435 --> 00:28:19,188
God help you
if you're caught with those!

262
00:28:19,355 --> 00:28:22,608
Gunrunning isn't exactly new to us.

263
00:28:22,775 --> 00:28:26,696
Well, Brother Kipling,
goodbye and many thanks.

264
00:28:26,863 --> 00:28:29,949
Man, don't do it!

265
00:28:30,116 --> 00:28:32,118
The odds are too great.

266
00:28:32,285 --> 00:28:36,205
Wish us luck. We met upon the level.

267
00:28:36,372 --> 00:28:39,250
And we're parting on the square.

268
00:28:40,626 --> 00:28:42,545
Good luck, indeed.

269
00:28:48,676 --> 00:28:51,846
Come along, you ugly beast.

270
00:28:57,185 --> 00:28:58,603
Wait!

271
00:29:01,814 --> 00:29:05,359
Here. Take this.

272
00:29:26,506 --> 00:29:31,802
Last time Danny and me came through
the Khyber Pass, we fought our way...

273
00:29:31,969 --> 00:29:34,180
...yard by bloody yard...

274
00:29:34,347 --> 00:29:37,808
...and General Bobbs
called us heroes afterwards.

275
00:29:37,975 --> 00:29:41,062
But that was years ago.
Times have changed.

276
00:29:41,229 --> 00:29:45,858
- Blast! Look who's on sentry!
- Mulvaney!

277
00:29:46,234 --> 00:29:49,237
That loudmouthed mick
from the Black Tyrone!

278
00:29:49,403 --> 00:29:53,991
Private Mulvaney! Come to attention
when I am addressing you!

279
00:29:54,158 --> 00:29:56,202
Slope arms!

280
00:29:57,703 --> 00:30:00,873
Present! March!

281
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:04,544
Mark time!

282
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:07,213
At the double!

283
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:15,763
Corporal of the guard!

284
00:30:16,514 --> 00:30:20,142
Take three men and put
Private Mulvaney under arrest!

285
00:30:20,309 --> 00:30:22,854
Bloody man's drunk again!

286
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:26,190
We came through the Khyber
with that caravan...

287
00:30:26,357 --> 00:30:29,735
...doing all sorts of antics
to amuse the people.

288
00:30:29,902 --> 00:30:34,448
At night, he told them their fortunes
in a tongue of his own...

289
00:30:34,615 --> 00:30:36,325
...and I translated.

290
00:30:36,492 --> 00:30:38,661
And all concerned were happy...

291
00:30:38,828 --> 00:30:43,583
...because I promised them
all their wishes would come true.

292
00:30:55,636 --> 00:31:00,600
Then at Jaedallak we turned off
towards Kafiristan.

293
00:31:01,309 --> 00:31:05,980
They were sad to see us leave
the caravan. We'd brought it good luck.

294
00:31:06,147 --> 00:31:12,153
Two she-camels had foaled and there
was no sniping at us from the hills.

295
00:31:13,529 --> 00:31:17,283
They waved goodbye to the mad priest
and his servant.

296
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:21,204
And Danny danced them out of sight.

297
00:31:32,465 --> 00:31:37,386
The country was deserty.
The inhabitants were dispersed, solitary.

298
00:31:37,553 --> 00:31:40,890
We travelled by night
and kept away from villages.

299
00:31:41,057 --> 00:31:45,478
We didn't want to waste ammunition
in idle fighting with Afghans.

300
00:32:31,274 --> 00:32:33,359
The Pushtukan.

301
00:32:34,777 --> 00:32:40,157
A wavy blue line on the map, but we
couldn't hope to get camels across.

302
00:32:40,491 --> 00:32:45,371
So Peachy says,
"It doesn't matter what they cost...

303
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:50,042
...we'll trade them for goats.
We're playing for high stakes. "

304
00:32:50,293 --> 00:32:55,256
Major McCrimmon bet me 10 bob he could
blow up a goat skin in one breath.

305
00:32:55,464 --> 00:33:00,178
He did. Though he'd sat down
on an anthill in his kilt unknowing.

306
00:33:00,386 --> 00:33:03,389
Ten shillings was ten shillings
to McCrimmon!

307
00:33:34,879 --> 00:33:36,464
Mules.

308
00:33:38,508 --> 00:33:41,511
Now, the problem is...

309
00:33:42,386 --> 00:33:46,724
...how to divide five Afghans
from three mules...

310
00:33:46,974 --> 00:33:50,520
- ... and have two Englishmen left over.
- Shoot them.

311
00:33:50,728 --> 00:33:54,649
No. The mules would bolt.

312
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:01,489
Sit over there, Danny.

313
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:28,678
So we starts forward into those
bitter cold mountainous parts...

314
00:36:28,886 --> 00:36:32,807
...and never a path broader
than the back of your hand.

315
00:36:41,232 --> 00:36:44,318
The mountains was tall and white...

316
00:36:44,861 --> 00:36:47,905
...like wild rams,
they was always fighting...

317
00:36:48,114 --> 00:36:51,868
...so you couldn't sleep
for the din of their fighting.

318
00:37:17,393 --> 00:37:19,812
For God's sake, Danny, pipe down.

319
00:37:20,062 --> 00:37:24,275
- Why? Who's going to hear us?
- These mountains, that's who.

320
00:37:24,483 --> 00:37:29,071
- You wanna start an avalanche?
- You don't believe that, I hope.

321
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:33,159
If a king can't sing,
it ain't worth being king.

322
00:37:36,204 --> 00:37:38,247
The country was mountainous...

323
00:37:38,497 --> 00:37:42,627
...and the mules was most contrary.
They all died but one.

324
00:37:42,877 --> 00:37:45,421
And she died later on.

325
00:37:45,963 --> 00:37:50,718
Danny went snow-blind
and clung to jenny's tail.

326
00:37:51,385 --> 00:37:55,139
Up and up we went,
and down and down.

327
00:37:55,389 --> 00:38:00,102
Through defiles and over snowy saddles
till all at once...

328
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:03,940
...two giants stood in our way.

329
00:38:09,987 --> 00:38:12,198
God's holy trousers.

330
00:38:12,448 --> 00:38:14,075
What's the matter?

331
00:38:14,283 --> 00:38:19,038
Blokes twice our size standing
guarding the snow, like. Two of them.

332
00:38:19,288 --> 00:38:21,707
Give them a round apiece.

333
00:38:30,299 --> 00:38:32,510
Not a move out of them.

334
00:38:32,969 --> 00:38:34,887
Stay put.

335
00:38:35,096 --> 00:38:37,390
I'll reconnoitre.

336
00:38:45,523 --> 00:38:47,608
They're not real, thank God.

337
00:38:47,859 --> 00:38:49,402
They're horrible.

338
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:55,032
Put there by the Kafiris
to frighten the neighbours.

339
00:38:55,533 --> 00:38:59,829
Peachy, that means
we're in Kafiristan. Or almost.

340
00:39:00,496 --> 00:39:02,707
So it does.

341
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:08,921
- What was that?
- Our bridges have been burned.

342
00:39:09,172 --> 00:39:10,464
What do you mean?

343
00:39:10,965 --> 00:39:14,177
The bridge we crossed by
ain't there no longer.

344
00:39:14,927 --> 00:39:16,679
God.

345
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,238
Now what?

346
00:39:34,655 --> 00:39:36,991
- Tell me.
- A crevasse.

347
00:39:37,617 --> 00:39:40,494
We've had it, Danny.
Coming and going!

348
00:39:40,745 --> 00:39:42,663
- Wide?
- Wide enough!

349
00:39:42,914 --> 00:39:47,293
It drops into nothing below,
straight as a beggar can spit!

350
00:39:50,254 --> 00:39:55,384
That's the last of them, Peachy.
No more gods to burn.

351
00:39:56,469 --> 00:39:59,680
It looks like last post, Danny.

352
00:40:01,224 --> 00:40:05,853
I don't fancy dying by inches.
Feeling the cold creeping up my limbs.

353
00:40:06,062 --> 00:40:10,191
- Getting all numb.
- I'll do the necessary...

354
00:40:10,399 --> 00:40:13,694
- ... when the fire goes out.
- Fair enough.

355
00:40:15,238 --> 00:40:16,656
Bloody shame.

356
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,909
Getting this close and not making it.

357
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:25,081
A stone's throw away, our kingdom.

358
00:40:26,958 --> 00:40:31,462
I'd have liked to seen you, Danny,
with a gold crown on your head.

359
00:40:31,671 --> 00:40:35,091
If you could've found one
that fitted it.

360
00:40:37,343 --> 00:40:41,264
Peachy, in your opinion...

361
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:44,934
...have our lives been misspent?

362
00:40:45,893 --> 00:40:49,188
Well, that depends
on how you look at it.

363
00:40:49,397 --> 00:40:52,358
The world's not a better
place because of us.

364
00:40:52,567 --> 00:40:53,860
No, hardly that.

365
00:40:54,068 --> 00:40:58,656
- Nobody's gonna weep at our demise.
- And who'd want them to?

366
00:40:58,865 --> 00:41:02,577
And we haven't many good deeds
to our credit.

367
00:41:02,785 --> 00:41:06,455
None. None to brag about.

368
00:41:06,914 --> 00:41:09,250
But how many have been
where we've been...

369
00:41:09,458 --> 00:41:13,588
- ... and seen what we've seen?
- Bloody few. And that's a fact.

370
00:41:13,796 --> 00:41:18,217
Even now, I wouldn't change places
with the viceroy himself...

371
00:41:18,426 --> 00:41:22,763
- ... if it meant giving up my memories.
- Me neither.

372
00:41:23,556 --> 00:41:28,102
Remember the time the Highlanders
was retreating down the hill...

373
00:41:28,352 --> 00:41:33,900
...at Ali Masjit and Pipe Major
McCrimmon got his sporran shot off?

374
00:41:34,233 --> 00:41:36,277
Half a crown was in it, right?

375
00:41:36,485 --> 00:41:41,490
So he goes after it without checking
to see if that was all he'd lost!

376
00:41:41,741 --> 00:41:44,285
And then he got the Victoria Cross...

377
00:41:44,493 --> 00:41:47,872
...because the Highlanders
followed him up the hill!

378
00:42:36,128 --> 00:42:40,132
Danny, we can get on!

379
00:43:05,908 --> 00:43:07,702
Kafiristan.

380
00:43:08,786 --> 00:43:10,788
The promised land.

381
00:45:05,736 --> 00:45:08,447
Must be their Halloween.

382
00:45:18,457 --> 00:45:21,085
Upsadaisy, lad.

383
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:39,812
Brass band and all.
Hail the conquering heroes.

384
00:45:49,822 --> 00:45:53,034
Bloody cheek. Where's their gratitude?

385
00:45:53,284 --> 00:45:56,412
I say! I say there!

386
00:45:56,621 --> 00:45:58,623
Are you Englishmen, please?

387
00:45:59,665 --> 00:46:03,127
Stone the bleeding crows!
Yes, mate.

388
00:46:03,753 --> 00:46:07,089
- And who might you be?
- You just wait one jiffy.

389
00:46:28,986 --> 00:46:30,947
Peachy, it's a Gurkha.

390
00:46:31,906 --> 00:46:36,452
Rifleman Machendra Gurung.
Known to my regiment as Billy Fish.

391
00:46:36,702 --> 00:46:39,580
Is that right? Well, report, rifleman.

392
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:42,083
What are you doing here?
Wherever here is.

393
00:46:42,625 --> 00:46:46,504
- I come with Colonel Robertson, sir.
- The geographer?

394
00:46:46,754 --> 00:46:48,631
Oh, dear me, alas, by Jove.

395
00:46:48,881 --> 00:46:52,385
Party not reaching Er-Heb
for very misfortunate reasons.

396
00:46:52,635 --> 00:46:55,805
Large mountain is falling on everyone.

397
00:46:56,180 --> 00:47:00,059
Everybody buried alive
except your servant.

398
00:47:00,601 --> 00:47:03,980
What about them up there
banging drums...

399
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:06,732
...and then shooting arrows at us?

400
00:47:06,941 --> 00:47:09,402
Big noise to scare away devils!

401
00:47:09,652 --> 00:47:13,781
- Many devils here these days.
- They thought we was devils?

402
00:47:14,031 --> 00:47:16,242
Kafiristan peoples very ignorant.

403
00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:21,330
I say to head man Ootah, I say,
"Oh, no, by Jove, they're not devils...

404
00:47:21,581 --> 00:47:24,375
...they're Gorasahibs.
British soldiers. "

405
00:47:24,584 --> 00:47:26,002
Good man, Billy Fish.

406
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:29,755
And now, if you'll take us
to this Ootah bloke...

407
00:47:29,964 --> 00:47:32,758
...we will begin his education.

408
00:47:49,150 --> 00:47:52,570
People of Er-Heb, do not fear.

409
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:57,116
They are our friends, not our enemies.

410
00:47:57,366 --> 00:48:00,870
Do you understand?
Do not fear.

411
00:48:01,078 --> 00:48:04,207
There is no need to fear.
They're our friends.

412
00:48:07,418 --> 00:48:12,590
Why are you so afraid?
People of Er-Heb, do not fear!

413
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:15,718
They're from England!
British soldiers!

414
00:48:15,968 --> 00:48:18,596
White men.
Do not be afraid.

415
00:48:18,846 --> 00:48:20,765
Ootah!

416
00:48:21,015 --> 00:48:22,600
Come on down.

417
00:48:22,850 --> 00:48:27,980
No need to be afraid.
They're white men. Ootah!

418
00:48:28,856 --> 00:48:31,108
Come down!

419
00:48:33,236 --> 00:48:36,113
Don't be afraid.

420
00:48:52,004 --> 00:48:55,132
Tell him we won't hurt him,
not to worry.

421
00:49:13,609 --> 00:49:16,153
He wants to know where you come from.

422
00:49:16,362 --> 00:49:19,407
Tell him we tumbled from the skies.

423
00:49:25,496 --> 00:49:27,498
He wants to know, are you gods?

424
00:49:27,707 --> 00:49:31,961
Not gods, Englishmen,
which is the next best thing.

425
00:49:36,257 --> 00:49:39,135
I ofttimes tell Ootah
about Englishmans.

426
00:49:39,385 --> 00:49:42,221
How they name dogs,
take off hats to womans...

427
00:49:42,430 --> 00:49:46,392
...and march left, right
with rifles on their shoulders.

428
00:49:46,601 --> 00:49:50,563
Bringing enlightenment
to the darker regions of the earth.

429
00:49:52,273 --> 00:49:55,359
He wants to know how rifle works.

430
00:50:00,072 --> 00:50:01,824
Show him, Peachy.

431
00:50:14,587 --> 00:50:18,299
We are not gods, exactly,
but we are heaven-sent...

432
00:50:18,508 --> 00:50:21,552
...to deliver you from your enemies.

433
00:50:27,225 --> 00:50:29,936
Enemies all around.

434
00:50:30,645 --> 00:50:34,106
The Bashkai are the worst.

435
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:41,572
All town comes out and pisses
downstream when we go bathing.

436
00:50:41,822 --> 00:50:43,741
Shocking!

437
00:50:45,701 --> 00:50:48,329
They are always stealing our womans.

438
00:50:49,455 --> 00:50:51,082
Putting on masks.

439
00:50:54,001 --> 00:50:56,712
And so our head chap
is thinking them devils...

440
00:50:56,879 --> 00:51:02,385
- ... and running like bloody hell away.
- War! Red war we'll give them.

441
00:51:04,345 --> 00:51:08,516
He give you two goats for each
Bashkai man you're killing.

442
00:51:12,061 --> 00:51:14,522
One goat for each womans and childs.

443
00:51:14,730 --> 00:51:18,067
Rather than knock them over
one at a time...

444
00:51:18,276 --> 00:51:20,278
...we'd like to do it
in one fell swoop.

445
00:51:20,486 --> 00:51:25,908
Serve him up a proper victory.
Storm Bashkai, take the city.

446
00:51:30,329 --> 00:51:32,123
He says, " How much?"

447
00:51:32,373 --> 00:51:37,128
Only the honour of leading
the brave men of Er-Heb into battle.

448
00:51:42,675 --> 00:51:45,094
And what we fancy in souvenirs.

449
00:51:45,845 --> 00:51:51,767
- A bauble here and a bangle there.
- Bashkai is only the beginning.

450
00:51:52,018 --> 00:51:57,064
We hope to go on from victory to
victory until he runs out of enemies.

451
00:51:58,357 --> 00:52:01,485
And a monarch of all you survey.

452
00:52:05,406 --> 00:52:10,244
- All he surveys?
- From the highest place in the valley.

453
00:52:11,537 --> 00:52:15,249
The mountains will echo your name.

454
00:52:17,835 --> 00:52:22,256
Ootah the Great!

455
00:52:28,846 --> 00:52:31,182
Oh, he says he prefers
"Ootah the Terrible. "

456
00:52:31,432 --> 00:52:35,394
Then Ootah the Terrible it shall be.

457
00:52:40,983 --> 00:52:44,529
And take him in token of our earnest.

458
00:52:47,949 --> 00:52:51,661
And now the womans of Er-Heb
will cut his bollocks off!

459
00:52:51,911 --> 00:52:54,997
Couldn't happen in a better cause.

460
00:53:43,045 --> 00:53:44,755
- Contract.
- Contract.

461
00:53:53,890 --> 00:53:56,767
Ootah say, "You, you no like?"

462
00:53:57,018 --> 00:54:02,982
Tell him we've given up strong drink
until we've conquered all his enemies.

463
00:54:12,074 --> 00:54:14,702
Boil them once or twice in hot water...

464
00:54:14,911 --> 00:54:17,538
...and they'll come out
like chicken and ham.

465
00:54:17,747 --> 00:54:20,875
You wouldn't know them from the
Gaiety Chorus.

466
00:54:24,378 --> 00:54:29,258
- Ootah says, "Take your pick. "
- He does?

467
00:54:31,344 --> 00:54:37,099
Oh, tell His Majesty one's prettier
than another. I couldn't choose.

468
00:54:37,308 --> 00:54:41,687
Take as many as you like.
There are more where they came from.

469
00:54:41,896 --> 00:54:43,606
He has 27 daughters.

470
00:54:43,814 --> 00:54:47,527
They're his daughters?
His own daughters?

471
00:54:47,777 --> 00:54:51,781
- Dirty old brute!
- Different countries, different customs.

472
00:54:51,989 --> 00:54:54,575
Mustn't be prejudiced, Peachy.

473
00:54:54,784 --> 00:54:59,580
Tell His Majesty we've also taken
a vow not to dally with females...

474
00:54:59,789 --> 00:55:03,334
...till all his enemies
are vanquished.

475
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:16,889
He has 32 sons if you're liking boys.

476
00:55:18,599 --> 00:55:20,601
Tell him he makes my gorge rise!

477
00:55:20,852 --> 00:55:25,898
Hold on, Peachy, he's only being
hospitable according to his likes.

478
00:55:33,948 --> 00:55:35,283
Polo!

479
00:56:05,605 --> 00:56:08,524
Everything's the same.
The ball's bigger.

480
00:56:08,858 --> 00:56:12,486
- Is the ball always that big?
- Depends on size of head.

481
00:56:12,695 --> 00:56:17,366
Big head, big ball.
This here Bashkai man. Big damn head.

482
00:56:17,575 --> 00:56:19,368
The bloody heathens.

483
00:56:19,619 --> 00:56:24,123
Different countries, different customs.
Mustn't be prejudiced.

484
00:56:25,625 --> 00:56:28,503
Now, listen to me,
you benighted muckers.

485
00:56:30,838 --> 00:56:34,926
We're gonna teach you soldiering,
the noblest profession.

486
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:42,266
When we're done, you'll be able to
slaughter enemies like civilized men!

487
00:56:42,475 --> 00:56:46,687
But first, you'll have to learn
to march in step...

488
00:56:46,938 --> 00:56:50,608
...do the manual of arms
without having to think.

489
00:56:50,816 --> 00:56:55,404
Good soldiers don't think,
they just obey.

490
00:56:56,405 --> 00:57:00,660
You think if a man thought twice,
he'd die for his country?

491
00:57:00,868 --> 00:57:04,747
Not bloody likely!
He wouldn't go near the battlefield!

492
00:57:05,081 --> 00:57:08,167
One look at your foolish faces...

493
00:57:08,417 --> 00:57:12,129
...tells me you're going to be
crack troops.

494
00:57:12,338 --> 00:57:16,759
Him there with a 51/2 hat size
has the makings of a bloody hero.

495
00:57:26,018 --> 00:57:30,356
Timing in the British Army
has always been: "One, two, three. "

496
00:57:31,107 --> 00:57:32,775
One, two, three.

497
00:57:35,152 --> 00:57:38,614
Say after me, "One, two, three. "

498
00:57:41,409 --> 00:57:44,745
Wait. Ready, steady, go.

499
00:57:45,246 --> 00:57:46,998
One, two, three.

500
00:57:47,248 --> 00:57:50,334
One, two, three.

501
00:57:50,543 --> 00:57:55,923
Say it at the same time as the others.
Tell him to say it at the same time!

502
00:57:59,051 --> 00:58:00,678
Right. Go!

503
00:58:00,887 --> 00:58:02,513
One, two, three.

504
00:58:02,847 --> 00:58:04,432
One, two, three.

505
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:07,810
Billy, tell him to say it
with the others!

506
00:58:08,477 --> 00:58:12,148
One, two, three. Right.
Now ready, steady, go.

507
00:58:12,398 --> 00:58:13,941
One, two, three.

508
00:58:14,192 --> 00:58:17,570
No! He's saying it
before the others, Billy.

509
00:58:17,778 --> 00:58:21,782
Not before them, not after them,
with them!

510
00:58:22,158 --> 00:58:25,703
Right. Attention!

511
00:58:26,287 --> 00:58:28,539
No. You, look...

512
00:58:30,374 --> 00:58:35,421
That one goes to there! Say that one
goes to there! That's it!

513
00:58:36,714 --> 00:58:38,508
Down there, like that.

514
00:58:38,716 --> 00:58:41,552
There. There we are.
Okay? Right.

515
00:59:00,404 --> 00:59:03,282
Come on, smarten up,
you horrible lot!

516
00:59:03,533 --> 00:59:05,368
Attention!

517
00:59:05,618 --> 00:59:07,203
That's better.

518
00:59:07,453 --> 00:59:10,331
Troops, march!

519
00:59:12,917 --> 00:59:16,170
By the left. Quick. March!

520
00:59:16,379 --> 00:59:20,967
Left. Left. Left, right, left.

521
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:36,315
Wait. You're a handsome piece,
that I don't deny...

522
00:59:36,566 --> 00:59:40,820
...but the contract states the party
of the first part, Danny...

523
00:59:41,070 --> 00:59:45,199
...and the party of the second part,
which is me...

524
00:59:45,449 --> 00:59:48,286
...shall nowise compromise ourselves...

525
00:59:48,494 --> 00:59:51,831
...with parties of the third part,
which is you.

526
00:59:52,039 --> 00:59:54,333
All binding, properly sworn to...

527
00:59:54,917 --> 00:59:58,254
...witnessed and attested.

528
00:59:59,338 --> 01:00:01,424
- Danny!
- So!

529
01:00:02,216 --> 01:00:04,594
Thank God you arrived.

530
01:00:04,844 --> 01:00:07,430
Let's go seek safety in battle.

531
01:00:34,957 --> 01:00:37,752
Trumpeter, sound your trumpet!

532
01:01:10,535 --> 01:01:12,203
Billy Fish.

533
01:01:14,914 --> 01:01:18,584
Blood is what we want.
The bloodier, the better.

534
01:01:18,793 --> 01:01:20,753
So it shall be!

535
01:01:23,798 --> 01:01:27,260
Like old times, Peachy.
Reminds me of Ali Majid.

536
01:01:27,468 --> 01:01:30,680
It's a good job the odds
are only 10 to 1.

537
01:01:42,608 --> 01:01:44,026
Halt!

538
01:01:48,406 --> 01:01:51,534
Line up in a straight line here.

539
01:02:09,927 --> 01:02:11,971
Present!

540
01:02:13,097 --> 01:02:14,891
Aim!

541
01:02:44,462 --> 01:02:46,172
Who are they?

542
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:47,965
What's happening?

543
01:02:48,216 --> 01:02:49,759
Very holy men.

544
01:02:50,009 --> 01:02:54,722
They walk through Kafiristan
collecting offerings for Holy City.

545
01:02:55,723 --> 01:03:00,311
Battle is postponed
until priests have passed.

546
01:03:01,812 --> 01:03:06,192
- Why are their eyes closed?
- They don't wish to see any badness...

547
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:11,989
...so keep eyes closed until they
return to beauties of Sikandergul.

548
01:03:41,894 --> 01:03:43,312
Fire!

549
01:03:46,524 --> 01:03:48,526
Aim! Fire!

550
01:03:53,614 --> 01:03:56,659
Charge! Come on.

551
01:03:57,743 --> 01:04:01,163
Oh, that great bloody showoff!

552
01:04:01,414 --> 01:04:06,127
Rifle section, form line!
Fix bayonets!

553
01:04:26,564 --> 01:04:28,691
Advance!

554
01:04:28,941 --> 01:04:32,111
Volley fire! Commence!

555
01:04:32,612 --> 01:04:34,572
Charge!

556
01:06:13,337 --> 01:06:17,967
What did you think you were
playing at charging single-handed?

557
01:06:18,217 --> 01:06:23,055
- I got carried away. Blood was up.
- Acting like a green lieutenant...

558
01:06:23,264 --> 01:06:26,309
...hoping to be mentioned
in dispatches!

559
01:06:26,559 --> 01:06:28,728
- You ought to be ashamed!
- Sorry.

560
01:06:28,978 --> 01:06:32,231
Supposing you got killed.
Where would I be at?

561
01:06:32,398 --> 01:06:34,984
- Won't happen again.
- See it don't!

562
01:06:35,193 --> 01:06:39,322
- Why are you carrying that arrow?
- No particular reason.

563
01:06:46,204 --> 01:06:47,580
Hold on!

564
01:06:47,830 --> 01:06:49,540
What's he up to?

565
01:07:01,219 --> 01:07:04,889
He say he win this big battle.
According to custom...

566
01:07:05,139 --> 01:07:07,808
- ... he lop off their heads.
- Great warrior?

567
01:07:08,017 --> 01:07:11,020
I never saw him in the
thick of the fray.

568
01:07:11,229 --> 01:07:14,315
There's no prisoner executions
in this army.

569
01:07:14,524 --> 01:07:17,068
Tell him to put that sword away.

570
01:07:21,864 --> 01:07:25,493
He says once sword unsheathed,
it must taste blood.

571
01:07:25,701 --> 01:07:29,372
Just as I thought.
He hasn't had it out until now!

572
01:07:34,418 --> 01:07:38,965
He says watch out or he get very angry
and lop your head off.

573
01:07:51,018 --> 01:07:54,522
All right. Up you get.
Off your hunkers.

574
01:07:54,772 --> 01:07:57,692
No more grovelling.

575
01:07:57,900 --> 01:08:00,111
We aren't gonna torch your city...

576
01:08:00,319 --> 01:08:03,990
...or hang you in chains,
nor rape your daughters.

577
01:08:05,533 --> 01:08:11,289
Tell them to divide their goods in half
and we will choose which half we want.

578
01:08:15,710 --> 01:08:20,923
Henceforth, let the men of Er-Heb
and the men of Bashkai be as brothers.

579
01:08:21,674 --> 01:08:23,259
Brothers in arms.

580
01:08:23,676 --> 01:08:28,681
Let them march under one banner
and share in the victories to come.

581
01:08:34,645 --> 01:08:38,399
Have the Bashkai any enemies
to speak of?

582
01:08:40,902 --> 01:08:42,820
Oh, enemies all around!

583
01:08:43,070 --> 01:08:46,490
Bhardoks, Ghundaras, Shus, Khawaks.

584
01:08:49,202 --> 01:08:53,873
The Bhardoks piss downstream
on Bashkai people when they bathe.

585
01:08:54,123 --> 01:08:55,166
Shocking!

586
01:08:55,374 --> 01:08:58,628
We'll strike them
and grind them into dust!

587
01:09:04,509 --> 01:09:07,803
Silver bracelet, 10 shillings.

588
01:09:08,012 --> 01:09:12,600
A good heavy necklace of the same,
worth a fiver at least.

589
01:09:13,518 --> 01:09:15,937
Earring with bangles.

590
01:09:16,646 --> 01:09:20,107
One pig sticker with plain handle.

591
01:09:20,691 --> 01:09:24,070
A gold coin worn pretty thin.

592
01:09:25,738 --> 01:09:29,909
A rosy red ring
and a few other ones, plain.

593
01:09:30,117 --> 01:09:33,996
All this should fetch
10 or 15 quid in a London shop.

594
01:09:34,205 --> 01:09:36,999
Not too bad for the back of beyond.

595
01:09:37,875 --> 01:09:39,752
Sikander!

596
01:09:40,002 --> 01:09:42,421
They're calling for you.

597
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:45,758
For me?

598
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:10,700
Sikander. Sikander.

599
01:10:10,950 --> 01:10:13,703
What does Sikander mean, Billy?

600
01:10:13,995 --> 01:10:17,874
Sikander a god. Come here
long ago from the West.

601
01:10:18,082 --> 01:10:21,252
That's the bloke Kipling told us about.

602
01:10:21,502 --> 01:10:22,920
Alexander?

603
01:10:23,171 --> 01:10:24,714
Alexander. Sikander.

604
01:10:25,756 --> 01:10:27,258
Here.

605
01:10:27,466 --> 01:10:30,428
- Alexander.
- He builded great city.

606
01:10:30,636 --> 01:10:34,473
Sikandergul, high in mountains.
Sit on throne.

607
01:10:34,724 --> 01:10:36,434
All people worship him.

608
01:10:36,642 --> 01:10:40,813
Then one day, time comes,
he say he must go to East.

609
01:10:41,022 --> 01:10:43,941
People pull their hair out,
tear clothes.

610
01:10:44,150 --> 01:10:47,904
So Sikander promised to send back son.

611
01:10:48,154 --> 01:10:51,616
328 B.C., encyclopaedia said.

612
01:10:52,658 --> 01:10:57,914
They saw arrow go into Danny's chest,
him pluck it out, and not bleeding.

613
01:10:59,332 --> 01:11:00,458
So?

614
01:11:00,666 --> 01:11:04,378
So, son of Sikander.

615
01:11:04,795 --> 01:11:06,464
They think I'm a god?

616
01:11:10,009 --> 01:11:14,555
A god! Put your foot out
that I may kiss your big toe.

617
01:11:15,264 --> 01:11:18,893
- You may kiss my royal arse.
- Not royal, holy!

618
01:11:19,143 --> 01:11:21,687
- You're a deity, remember?
- Peachy.

619
01:11:21,896 --> 01:11:25,691
- Yes, Billy?
- Is Danny not son of Sikander?

620
01:11:25,942 --> 01:11:30,780
No, he's a man like us. He can
break wind at both ends simultaneous.

621
01:11:30,988 --> 01:11:33,824
Which I bet is more
than any god can do!

622
01:11:34,033 --> 01:11:36,077
But the arrow.

623
01:11:37,578 --> 01:11:40,790
The arrow stuck in the bandolier.
No miracle.

624
01:11:40,998 --> 01:11:46,003
You better tell them. And my dad's
name was Herbert Dravot, Esquire...

625
01:11:46,254 --> 01:11:49,048
...and he was a bar steward in Durham!

626
01:11:49,298 --> 01:11:50,758
Hang on, Danny.

627
01:12:02,228 --> 01:12:05,356
- Maybe we're missing a bet.
- What do you mean?

628
01:12:05,565 --> 01:12:08,234
Supposing you was an ignorant Kafiri...

629
01:12:08,442 --> 01:12:11,737
...who would you rather follow,
a god or a man?

630
01:12:12,113 --> 01:12:15,908
Now, we're here to conquer
this country, ain't we?

631
01:12:16,158 --> 01:12:21,455
Well, with you as a god, it would take
half the time and half the trouble.

632
01:12:21,664 --> 01:12:24,667
The idea is a bit blasphemous like.

633
01:12:24,876 --> 01:12:25,960
No, Danny...

634
01:12:26,210 --> 01:12:31,132
...blaspheming is when
you take his name in vain...

635
01:12:32,258 --> 01:12:34,260
...God Almighty's.

636
01:12:35,136 --> 01:12:38,347
What if they found out
we was having them on?

637
01:12:38,556 --> 01:12:40,224
Why should they?

638
01:12:40,474 --> 01:12:42,810
We won't tell them.

639
01:12:45,813 --> 01:12:50,818
- You won't tell them, will you, Billy?
- Oh, no. Indeed, by Jove, no.

640
01:12:57,408 --> 01:12:59,285
Polo.

641
01:13:00,119 --> 01:13:01,996
Polo.
