The legend began
beneath these dark hills

2
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:52,590
and under this same sky.

3
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,190
It tells øf a swørd
øf great pøwer.

4
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:00,290
førged før the cønquerør
Julius Caesar.

5
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,800
This weapøn was passed døwn
until it reached

6
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:09,940
the last øf Caesar's nøble line.
the emperør Tiberius.

7
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,840
On his death. it was hidden away
tø keep it frøm the hands øf evil men.

8
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:19,550
Før generatiøns.
it lay in a secret place.

9
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,750
marked by the sign
øf a pentangle.

10
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:27,320
and as it was written.
under the very gaze øf Caesar.

11
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,330
I. Ambrøsinus. børn in Britannia...

12
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:36,470
was øne øf many men whø søught it.

13
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,470
In a time øf injustice.

14
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:44,310
I made it my life's task
tø find the swørd

15
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:47,280
and the øne righteøus
enøugh tø wield it.

16
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:50,250
I jøurneyed far
acrøss the Cøntinent.

17
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,050
thrøugh the heart øf an empire
that ruled half the knøwn wørld.

18
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:00,560
Nøw a threatened Røme
was calling back her bravest and best

19
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:02,690
tø defend her bøundaries.

20
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,290
GUARD: Make way!

21
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,270
Good to be home,
Commander?

22
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:53,340
Is this what I'm supposed to wear?

23
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,440
I can't even remember
how to put it on.

24
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,150
Why ask, Vatrenus, hmm?

25
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,180
Why me?

26
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:04,620
Because they trust you.
You are a true Roman.

27
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:09,650
Besides, 'tis a glorious thing,
they say, to guard the new Caesar.

28
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:12,060
We held Africa for them
for 10 years,

29
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:13,860
grew old on their battlefields,

30
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:16,100
lost good men.

31
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,930
What was it all for?

32
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:22,810
We're soldiers, Aurelius.
Politicians make the decisions.

33
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:27,070
AURELIUS: Two breeds of men
to be avoided like the pox...

34
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:30,120
- (blade scrapes)
...politicians and philosophers.

35
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:36,210
You know, in Alexandria
they cut off the hand that steals.

36
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:37,280
No, please.

37
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,950
Once the hand is off, it's for God
to decide whether you live or die.

38
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,390
Most die.

39
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:44,720
Batiatus!

40
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:49,900
Do it outside. It'll make a mess.
Blood everywhere.

41
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,510
- Who's this?
- Thief. Caught in the act.

42
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,570
I'm not a thief.

43
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,310
Now he's yours, big man.

44
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:06,950
- One hand or two, Commander?
- Oh, just the one.

45
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,320
(chuckles)

46
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:18,930
No, let me go, please!

47
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,130
I wasn't gonna steal it, I swear to you!
I give you my word.

48
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,570
AURELIUS: Your word?

49
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,170
You?

50
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,040
A street boy? A thief?

51
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:30,740
How can you be
a man of your word?

52
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:32,110
I just wanted to look at it.

53
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,520
I am Aurelianus Caius Antonius,
commander of the lmperial Guard.

54
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:40,280
I am asking you,
do you lie to me?

55
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,750
I would not lie to you.

56
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:53,000
You come back in ten years, boy.

57
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,560
I'll give you your own sword.

58
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,230
Now get out.

59
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:04,010
Another worthy foe
vanquished then, Commander.

60
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:11,040
It's heartening to see
soldiers of Rome display such valor.

61
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,780
Who are you?

62
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:15,790
One who knows humiliation
to be a poor teacher...

63
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:18,520
for both men and boys.

64
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:20,990
I smell a philosopher.

65
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,720
Are you all right?

66
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,690
- Take the boy and go.
- In our own good time.

67
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:37,740
Heh. He said go, old man.

68
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,210
More than a philosopher, then.

69
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:58,130
(blowing softly)

70
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:06,470
How'd he do that?

71
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:10,030
Every time we have goose for dinner,
you do that same old trick.

72
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,100
Oh, dear.

73
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,370
Have I done that one before?

74
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:15,010
And I didn't need your help.

75
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,010
(fountain trickling)

76
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:20,050
Either way, you missed
your Greek lesson.

77
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,650
How come you never told me
you knew how to fight?

78
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,830
Get out of here,
both of you. Go, go!

79
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:28,750
Let them pass.

80
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:40,270
- Odoacer.
- Orestes.

81
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:44,080
For ten years
I have supported Rome.

82
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,940
Ten years my warriors

83
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:47,980
- have fought beside your legions.
- Who is that?

84
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:49,950
(whispering)
The commander of the Goths.

85
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:52,450
ODOACER: So now here I am...

86
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,720
to claim my dues.

87
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,520
And what are your dues, General?

88
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:58,720
One-third of all Italy.

89
00:06:58,790 --> 00:06:59,760
(scoffs)

90
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:01,520
You think I'm joking?

91
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,790
Is this true, Orestes?
Did you make such a pact?

92
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:08,170
No... how could I promise
what isn't mine to give?

93
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,600
ODOACER: One-third of Italy.

94
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,800
That way the alliance continues

95
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:14,740
and your new Caesar

96
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:18,370
will not topple from his throne
like the others before him.

97
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:22,310
I promised you nothing beyond
the reward you were already given.

98
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:27,480
You 've grown so tall, Orestes...

99
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:31,190
you forget whose shoulders
you stand on.

100
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:40,960
Romulus, where have you been?

101
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,700
We've been looking everywhere.

102
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:49,340
Ambrosinus, you took him
outside without a guard?!

103
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:50,970
- You know the danger.
- No, l...

104
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:53,980
It's a fine morning.
We went for a walk. No harm done.

105
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:57,210
You know what
tomorrow holds for him?

106
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,450
For all of us.

107
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,320
I know perfectly well, Orestes.

108
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:03,360
I have as much care
for your son as you have.

109
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,090
What did you say?

110
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:11,990
You go too far, schoolmaster.

111
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:13,830
Leave us.

112
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:21,740
Orestes, sometimes I think you
forget he is just a boy.

113
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:25,540
He has your blood in his veins,
bloodline of the Caesars.

114
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:27,710
He was never just a boy.

115
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:41,760
Mother, in five years
there have been five emperors...

116
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:44,300
and they were all murdered.

117
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:49,730
What will happen to me?

118
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,670
You will be guarded by the best.

119
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:01,200
You will live long and rule wisely.

120
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:18,590
(cheering)

121
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,370
My son...

122
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,480
this day you join the immortals.

123
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:47,010
Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

124
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:48,350
(clanks)

125
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:52,720
Mother, am I now the most
powerful man in the world?

126
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:53,780
You are.

127
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:56,260
Then why can't I stay out
on the day I am crowned?

128
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,160
What am I to be,
a god or a boy?

129
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,100
You are Caesar,
and my Caesar must be protected.

130
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,040
But who would harm me?

131
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:14,210
The one you saw,
Odoacer the Goth.

132
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,720
He is our ally.

133
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:18,510
And you, teacher
of words and numbers,

134
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:21,020
what is the business
of the state to you?

135
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:25,590
My only concern
is the welfare of your son.

136
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:28,360
You make concern yourself no longer.

137
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:29,760
He is Caesar now.

138
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:31,260
He's still a boy.

139
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:32,800
Perhaps he still needs me.

140
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:35,730
Well, your task is over.

141
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,200
Leave us. Don't come back.

142
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,540
ORESTES: Romulus...

143
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:59,390
Hail, Caesar.

144
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:02,660
This is Aurelius,
of the Nova Invicta.

145
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,890
He will command
your personal guard.

146
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:08,960
May I see your sword, Commander?

147
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,070
He must do everything
to protect me from harm,

148
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:20,550
- must he not, Father?
- Indeed, he must.

149
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,980
To the last breath.

150
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:24,280
And do I have your word on that?

151
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:26,880
You have his word.

152
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:29,450
He is sworn to serve you.

153
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,080
Is it so, Commander?

154
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,790
Thank you.

155
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,990
I only wanted to look at it.

156
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:42,800
(blade scrapes)

157
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,330
VATRENUS: Open the gate.

158
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:51,100
AMBROSINUS:
And this is also Caesar's will?

159
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:54,770
VATRENUS: You 've been well rewarded.
Go back where you came from.

160
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:59,410
My crime is putting new ideas
into a young head,

161
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:01,050
teaching a lad to think for himself.

162
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,650
This lad is our emperor.

163
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:07,190
Which do you serve:
Caesar or your own ideas?

164
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:10,200
"A wise man never asks
what another man serves...

165
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,660
...for only his actions
will speak the true answer."

166
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:15,260
You 've read your Seneca.

167
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:17,500
I find poets as dangerous
as philosophers.

168
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:20,760
And you...

169
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:23,540
Where did you get this?

170
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:27,370
AMBROSINUS:
A long time ago...

171
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,750
in another land.

172
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:32,290
(screams)

173
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:34,720
...from a man who loved
only power.

174
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,890
So you 're an adventurer, as well.

175
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,790
If I see you again in Rome,
it'll be on the point of my sword.

176
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:46,770
Take care in the mist, Commander.

177
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:49,830
It may hide what the gods
themselves dare not look upon.

178
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,480
NESTOR: But who will guard
the guardians themselves?

179
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,850
Nestor?

180
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,440
Leave us.

181
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,690
A senator.

182
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,160
Well, these sit better on me
than armor ever did.

183
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,020
How is it with you, Aurelius?

184
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,220
Oh, a little older... no wiser.

185
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,890
After all these years?

186
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:21,940
Did you ever marry, have children?

187
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,160
No.

188
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:25,660
So what do you make of Rome?

189
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,070
Different.

190
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:28,900
Uneasy.

191
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:32,570
If you 're to guard our new Caesar,
keep your wits about you.

192
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:37,520
And come see me. Friends are
a rare commodity these days.

193
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:38,640
I will.

194
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:59,930
GUARD: The Goths!
They've betrayed us!

195
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:01,470
(shouting, swords clashing)

196
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,740
(catapult rumbling)

197
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:12,510
GUARD: You! To the wall!

198
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,790
Commander!

199
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:18,560
Prepare to fire!

200
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,960
Aurelius!

201
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,260
Down!

202
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:29,630
Defend the Emperor!

203
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,970
Get back, behind! Go! Go!

204
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,110
Form wall!

205
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:52,590
MAN: Over this way!

206
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,530
Get back, boy!

207
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:16,840
Yah!

208
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:23,180
(yells)

209
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,830
Ugh!

210
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,370
Father!

211
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:42,200
Odoacer wants the boy alive!

212
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:46,050
I'll do my best.

213
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,210
(squelches)

214
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:02,000
Save yourself.

215
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,760
Yah.

216
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:21,680
(horse whinnies)

217
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:33,790
Aah!

218
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:45,590
(hooves pounding)

219
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:16,600
(flies buzzing, fires crackling)

220
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:01,880
King, the emissary
from Constantinople.

221
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:03,710
ODOACER: Welcome, Excellency.

222
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:06,690
The city is ours.

223
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:09,720
I ask that your empire recognize me

224
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:12,450
as the sole ruler of Rome
and all her dominions.

225
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:15,690
My emperor is in Constantinople.

226
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:19,120
I am his eyes and his ears,

227
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,330
but I cannot speak
on his behalf.

228
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,560
Then go and seek his word.

229
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,700
Master!

230
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:40,320
Aurelius! Fetch water.

231
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:45,250
The boy, Caesar...
is he alive?

232
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:47,020
I couldn't find him.

233
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:55,200
His mother and father were killed,
as were my men.

234
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,600
How did this happen?

235
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:59,430
Some of your men survived,
that I do know.

236
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:02,030
Vatrenus was taken prisoner.

237
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,580
There may be others with him, but...

238
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:06,550
they're to be executed
as an example

239
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:08,610
to those who would
stand against Odoacer.

240
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,780
(chains rattling)

241
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:26,900
Come to me.

242
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:45,580
Is it for you that
so many people have died?

243
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,420
Such an innocent face.

244
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:51,550
The blood of the Caesars
flows in his veins.

245
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:55,120
Old Wulfila here
thinks that I should fear you.

246
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:57,590
Is this true?

247
00:20:57,670 --> 00:21:01,330
He is the last of the bloodline.
End it now!

248
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,100
Old Rome will die, and we rule!

249
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:04,300
We?

250
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,840
We rule?

251
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:09,900
Take care, Wulfila.

252
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:12,840
Sometimes your tongue
runs ahead of your brain.

253
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,150
What do you say, boy?

254
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,490
Should I be afraid of you?

255
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:32,330
Why is Caesar treated so?

256
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:35,130
Why is Caesar treated so...

257
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,880
Perhaps Wulfila's right.

258
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:48,740
Perhaps I should
end this here, right now.

259
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:55,650
Can you see yourself?

260
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,420
Can you see your face?

261
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:01,990
What do you see?

262
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,690
Do you see a boy?

263
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:07,860
Or do you see a Caesar?

264
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:11,500
I see...

265
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:12,560
Tell me.

266
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,640
I see a Caesar.

267
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,610
I am Caesar.

268
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:28,210
Wrong answer.

269
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:29,690
Take him away.
Cut his head off.

270
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:34,550
AMBROSINUS: That will be
a grave error, Lord Odoacer.

271
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,560
ODOACER: Who are you?

272
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:40,430
You kill the boy,
you make a martyr of him,

273
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,370
and Caesar's ghost
will haunt you ever after.

274
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,730
Is that so?

275
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,430
- Read the signs.
- What signs?

276
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:47,000
An omen.

277
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:49,440
Do not mistake it, Odoacer.

278
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:51,000
(caws)

279
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,940
If you hear one thing,
then hear this.

280
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:56,070
What now happens in this room
will echo across an empire.

281
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:57,670
A city may be won by blood.

282
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,010
(caws)

283
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,080
It takes a man of vision to rule.

284
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,920
All empires are built on blood.

285
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:05,080
People will judge you.

286
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:08,930
The people will thank the gods
that they survived

287
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,690
and serve their new master.

288
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,030
Now, I asked. Who are you?

289
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:16,590
Will they respect a leader
who's so afraid of a Roman child

290
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:18,230
he had to butcher him?

291
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:27,880
Perhaps the boy is more use to us
alive than dead.

292
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:32,050
Do you want to look a fool?
Kill them both!

293
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,450
Fool!

294
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:40,590
Your best hope for the future,
Lord Wulfila, lies in silence!

295
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:44,090
Give me your hand.

296
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:55,770
(groans)

297
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:12,590
Now, I ask, who are you?

298
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,920
I'm known by many names.

299
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:14,980
Like a thief.

300
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:17,260
Here I'm called Ambrosinus.

301
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:27,470
The boy will be taken
to the island fortress at Capri.

302
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:30,700
You... you will be his prison guard.

303
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:32,440
That's your reward.

304
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:34,850
No harm comes to him
unless I say so.

305
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:38,780
Not a hair on his head,
you understand me?

306
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:45,020
And take this one, too.

307
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:47,020
I don't trust him.

308
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:55,130
Someone's here.

309
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,330
Where?

310
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:04,570
Please.

311
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:06,670
Wait, Aurelius, I know this man.

312
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,720
He speaks for the Eastern Empire.

313
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:09,770
Is the boy alive?

314
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:11,250
I saw him in chains.

315
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,950
They're taking him to Capri.

316
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:15,280
I'll find him,
bring him back.

317
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,850
From Capri?
That's impossible.

318
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:20,360
- It's an island, a natural fortress.
- I'll need my men.

319
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:22,730
We've long been allies, Senator.

320
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:25,330
Free your Caesar.

321
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:29,060
My emperor will give him sanctuary
until it is safe for him to return to Rome.

322
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:49,210
We meet at Fano in six days,
on the beach.

323
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:51,880
If you bring back the boy,
there'll be a boat to take us east.

324
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:56,260
Six days, then.

325
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:57,850
- To the last breath.
- To the last breath.

326
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:02,570
What's this?

327
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,630
One of the ambassador's guards.
You 'll need help to free your men.

328
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:08,110
These people are our allies.
Use them.

329
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:10,800
(sighs)

330
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,010
Follow me.

331
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:27,890
Act as my prisoner.
When I give the signal, try to escape.

332
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,900
You understand
what I've told you, yes?

333
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,730
Then do as I've said
and nothing more.

334
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,570
(Demetrius groaning)

335
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,670
Uhn!

336
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:44,730
(spits)

337
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,570
Him first.

338
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,750
- Stop!
- (horse neighs)

339
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:53,840
Another prisoner.

340
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:00,530
I'm to take this one's head
back to Rome,

341
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:02,690
an assassin sent
to kill Lord Odoacer.

342
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,290
(quietly) Go.

343
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:08,330
Uhn! Aah!

344
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,630
Get him!

345
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:25,180
(yells)

346
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:27,450
(blades ring)

347
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:35,950
(horse whinnies)

348
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:40,000
(yelling)

349
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,360
Uhn!

350
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:49,500
(swords clanging)

351
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:01,080
Ambrosinus...

352
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:04,390
I want to be with them.

353
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:06,820
I want to be with
my mother and father.

354
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:08,050
You are with them.

355
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,520
They live on in your heart.

356
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:13,960
You cannot see them,

357
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:17,090
but it's as if you 're in one room
and they're in the next.

358
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:19,970
I should have died, too.

359
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,130
Not your destiny.

360
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:22,700
I have no destiny.

361
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:26,230
Every living creature
has a destiny, be sure of it.

362
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:30,710
But when the pathway gets dark
and it's difficult to see the way...

363
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:33,810
Well...

364
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,610
that's why you have me...

365
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:39,360
for all that I'm worth.

366
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:40,980
(raven crowing)

367
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:43,260
Dumb bird. Forgot to feed it.

368
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:45,960
Pugie. Pugie!

369
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:48,590
I knew it.

370
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,600
I knew it was a trick!

371
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:53,100
Shh.

372
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:14,390
ROMULUS: Is this our destiny,

373
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:17,190
to be prisoners here
for the rest of our lives?

374
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,560
AMBROSINUS: Have faith.

375
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:22,030
There is a purpose behind all things.

376
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:39,080
- (chuffling)
- Where is he now?

377
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:40,980
No sign of the Goths.

378
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:44,620
But we should stay close to the river.

379
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,350
The river, yes.

380
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:47,820
They'll have scouts all the way.

381
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,490
- Agreed, so we...
- Mira.

382
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,550
Yes.

383
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:56,520
What?

384
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,360
My name. Mira.

385
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,040
There's your boat.

386
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:13,580
How d'you want to do this?

387
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:15,770
If we all go down there,
we'll scare him off.

388
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:17,480
He'll be gone before we get there.

389
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:28,220
Wait here.

390
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:36,030
He's a woman.

391
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:02,020
Uhn!

392
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,800
AMBROSINUS: This fortress
was built as a palace

393
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:11,930
by the great emperor Tiberius,
who, it is written,

394
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:14,370
was a man of great dignity
and bearing...

395
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,430
both of which you 've inherited.

396
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:18,740
So my ancestors built my prison.

397
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:22,410
A prison it is.

398
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:31,790
You thirsty, boy, hmm?

399
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:33,420
Go on, drink.

400
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,550
Mm?

401
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:37,320
(spits) Drink.

402
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:41,370
You dare insult me, boy! Huh!?

403
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:43,460
It is a long way down, no?

404
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:45,630
How many fingers
will it take you to learn

405
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:48,400
your fate lies in the palm
of this child's hand,

406
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,470
as sure as Odoacer
is your master.

407
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:52,840
Throw this boy to the rocks,
you will follow.

408
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:59,440
When the time comes, boy,

409
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:03,680
I will send you to join
your mother and your father.

410
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,520
You.

411
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,660
Odoacer said nothing of you.

412
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,130
String him up!

413
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:20,600
Hold.

414
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,070
What is this?

415
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,850
Are you some kind of priest?

416
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,250
A sorcerer?

417
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,050
Just a seeker after the truth.

418
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,550
You would never understand.

419
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:36,920
Put him up.

420
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:38,320
(grunts)

421
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:42,420
(Wulfila laughs)

422
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:54,010
How long is it to climb to the top?

423
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:56,770
BATIATUS:
An hour. Faster coming down.

424
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:59,470
Take up all the wood
we can spare. And rope.

425
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:00,670
You stay on the boat.

426
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,710
- You may need me.
- No.

427
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,420
The pentangle!

428
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,420
Of course, of course, of course!

429
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,400
This is the place.

430
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:25,660
The sword!
Tiberius must have brought it here.

431
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:28,040
And the boy will find it!

432
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:30,240
Romulus!

433
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:31,780
Ambrosinus?

434
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:33,310
Go to the temple.

435
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:35,710
Look for your ancestor,
Julius Caesar.

436
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,910
There is something he guards for you.

437
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:45,520
Look under the gaze of Caesar!

438
00:34:46,890 --> 00:34:49,660
(weakly) Of course,
of course, of course.

439
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:01,770
ROMULUS: Under the gaze of Caesar.

440
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:47,480
I told you to stay on the boat.

441
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:50,280
You will need my help.

442
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:56,930
You know what happens to a soldier
of mine who disobeys an order?

443
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:00,100
Your men are too slow.

444
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:02,990
Stay out of sight.

445
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:07,640
I don't see why you take the risk.

446
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:10,170
I serve my emperor.

447
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:14,540
He's your country's ally,
so I am with you.

448
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:16,410
Where did you learn to fight?

449
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:21,350
I come from Kerala,
in the south of India.

450
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:23,720
We were taught to fight
like our forefathers.

451
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,880
It is called Kalarippayattu.

452
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:30,060
When I was 14,
I was at the 7th level.

453
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:31,720
Out of how many?

454
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:33,690
Seven.

455
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:36,330
Shall we talk all day, or climb?

456
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,500
Julius Caesar.

457
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,520
"One edge to defend:

458
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:30,920
"one to defeat.

459
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:37,490
In Britannia was I forged to fit the hand
of he who was destined to rule."

460
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:56,440
I have work for you.

461
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:38,460
(winch creaking)

462
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:45,890
Oh!

463
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:55,570
(cracking)

464
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:04,210
(yells)

465
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:07,480
(screaming)

466
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:20,420
Uhn! Uh!

467
00:39:38,850 --> 00:39:41,320
(snoring softly)

468
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:02,570
Give me that sword.

469
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:05,110
Give it to me!

470
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:13,410
Uhn.

471
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:24,630
- You.
- Only two to rescue an emperor?

472
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:25,960
More are coming.

473
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:27,930
- WULFILA: Caesar!
- The temple!

474
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:29,900
(Wulfila yells)

475
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,740
Yours.

476
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:00,630
(grunts)

477
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:38,790
(gasps)

478
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,030
Uhn!

479
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:47,170
(thuds, clatters)

480
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:08,530
(head thuds, Wulfila yells)

481
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:34,250
(screams)

482
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,920
(running man yelling)

483
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:05,420
Uagh!

484
00:43:05,490 --> 00:43:07,390
(thuds, clatters)

485
00:43:25,310 --> 00:43:26,470
Tsk.

486
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:33,610
(swords clashing in distance)

487
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:37,450
AMBROSINUS:
Romulus!

488
00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:42,350
You found the sword, boy?

489
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:44,560
Save the emperor!

490
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,690
AMBROSINUS:
Where's Caesar's sword?

491
00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:49,590
ROMULUS: It's this way!

492
00:43:53,910 --> 00:43:55,460
Get them away.

493
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:57,200
Get them away!

494
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:03,710
(banging on door)

495
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:15,660
I got it.

496
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:17,890
Batiatus.

497
00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:21,430
Yours.

498
00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:28,760
- Go!
- This way.

499
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:33,880
Get the boy away.

500
00:44:45,890 --> 00:44:47,380
(grunting)

501
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:48,720
(slashes)

502
00:45:02,410 --> 00:45:03,500
(gurgles)

503
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:06,670
(sea birds calling)

504
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:11,670
Roman.

505
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:26,590
(swords ringing)

506
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:32,370
(Goths yelling)

507
00:45:38,010 --> 00:45:39,410
Where's the boy?

508
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:40,950
Safe below with the others.

509
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:16,770
You were right, Batiatus.
It is quicker on the way down.

510
00:46:16,850 --> 00:46:18,710
(Batiatus laughs)

511
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,060
"One edge to defend:
one to defeat.

512
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:41,070
"In Britannia was I forged

513
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:45,630
to fit the hand of he
who is destined to rule."

514
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,710
Caesar's sword.

515
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:52,210
That is why it had such power.

516
00:46:54,890 --> 00:46:56,550
Britannia.

517
00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:00,560
Gather the men!

518
00:47:02,830 --> 00:47:04,460
Made for a conqueror...

519
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:07,100
Julius Caesar.

520
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:15,840
Caius Julius Caesar
ensis caliburnis.

521
00:47:17,510 --> 00:47:18,940
Feel the weight.

522
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:49,630
This sword carries a prophecy.

523
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:52,270
Did you see anything...

524
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:53,570
anything written?

525
00:47:56,650 --> 00:47:59,020
Then you know all you need to know.

526
00:48:00,590 --> 00:48:01,680
Take it.

527
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,020
It's yours.

528
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:39,150
Welcome, Caesar!

529
00:48:39,990 --> 00:48:41,080
Aurelius.

530
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:42,560
All of you.

531
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:47,260
There is food and drink inside the tent.

532
00:48:48,530 --> 00:48:49,830
We need to talk.

533
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:50,930
Alone.

534
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:54,300
You 're safe now.

535
00:48:54,370 --> 00:48:56,500
From here you 'll be taken
to the Eastern Empire,

536
00:48:56,580 --> 00:48:58,300
to Constantinople.

537
00:49:00,310 --> 00:49:02,140
You 'll have sanctuary.

538
00:49:35,310 --> 00:49:36,300
Uh!

539
00:49:39,490 --> 00:49:42,610
The ambassador has heard
from Constantinople.

540
00:49:42,690 --> 00:49:45,250
The emperor will not give
sanctuary to the boy.

541
00:49:46,830 --> 00:49:49,520
He will not oppose Odoacer
nor offend him.

542
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:51,190
Everything has changed.

543
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:54,990
The day after you left, the garrison of Rome
swore allegiance to Odoacer.

544
00:49:55,070 --> 00:49:57,540
Now the rest of the commanders
have declared.

545
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:59,070
They all stand with the Goth.

546
00:50:00,070 --> 00:50:01,870
There must be others
still in the field.

547
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,070
What about the Ninth?

548
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:06,740
The Ninth Legion,
they're far to the north in Britannia.

549
00:50:06,810 --> 00:50:09,040
For all we know, Britannia
has crumbled into the sea.

550
00:50:09,110 --> 00:50:11,010
Then we must move fast.

551
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:12,140
Can you get me men?

552
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:16,480
(sighs) Yes, you can keep your rank,
command a new army.

553
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:17,950
Good. Then do it now.

554
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:19,960
We'll drive out the invaders
if I can have 5,000 men...

555
00:50:20,030 --> 00:50:21,930
Not for that, Aurelius, I can't do that.

556
00:50:21,990 --> 00:50:24,720
Why not? What is it with you, Nestor?

557
00:50:25,630 --> 00:50:29,000
- Odoacer isn't just a barbarian.
- Is he not?

558
00:50:29,070 --> 00:50:32,400
No, he's become a politician,
and a very astute one.

559
00:50:32,470 --> 00:50:35,030
Now he has the Senate on his side.

560
00:50:35,110 --> 00:50:36,370
How many of the Senate?

561
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:39,970
We have to see things as they are.

562
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:44,540
You 're with them.

563
00:50:46,590 --> 00:50:50,040
In time, perhaps,
we can challenge Odoacer, not now.

564
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:57,350
So let's say you give me
this army, Senator.

565
00:50:57,430 --> 00:50:59,400
What will you ask for in return?

566
00:51:00,570 --> 00:51:01,560
The boy.

567
00:51:01,630 --> 00:51:03,400
You mean Caesar?

568
00:51:03,470 --> 00:51:06,060
Caesar is a word from the past.

569
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:07,610
There is no Caesar.

570
00:51:13,350 --> 00:51:15,040
AMBASSADOR:
Prepare the horses.

571
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:17,910
Where is the boat?

572
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:21,910
I said prepare the horses.

573
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:27,220
Where is the boat to take
the emperor to Constantinople?

574
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:32,210
I gave you an order. What was it?

575
00:51:33,210 --> 00:51:43,210
