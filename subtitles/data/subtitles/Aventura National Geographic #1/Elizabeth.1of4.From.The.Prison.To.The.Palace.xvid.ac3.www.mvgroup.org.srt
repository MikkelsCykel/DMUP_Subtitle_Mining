(Starkey) 'In January 1559 Elizabeth I
was crowned Queen of England.

2
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:34,450
'She was the last
of the great Tudor dynasty,

3
00:00:34,539 --> 00:00:38,728
'a bright star who dazzled
both the nation and the world.'

4
00:00:44,298 --> 00:00:47,289
The achievement of most stars
fades quickly

5
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:52,810
but Elizabeth's has lasted for nearly
four centuries and it's easy to see why.

6
00:00:52,899 --> 00:00:56,210
She reigned for 45 tumultuous years.

7
00:00:56,298 --> 00:01:00,890
Her ships defeated the Spanish Armada
and sailed round the globe.

8
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:05,569
In her time Shakespeare wrote plays
and Spenser wrote poems.

9
00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:09,010
English noblemen
and foreign princes wooed her

10
00:01:09,099 --> 00:01:11,659
but she, the Virgin Queen,

11
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:16,370
made love to that loyalest
of audiences, the English people.

12
00:01:18,459 --> 00:01:22,000
'Elizabeth was one of the daughters
of King Henry VIII.

13
00:01:22,099 --> 00:01:26,409
'But the right of women to succeed
to the throne was still in doubt

14
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,328
'and her path there would be perilous.

15
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:36,129
'Her father would kill her mother
and she would be disinherited.

16
00:01:36,218 --> 00:01:42,129
'Her sister would imprison her in the
Tower and threaten her with execution.

17
00:01:42,218 --> 00:01:46,409
'Men would love her for her
royal status, not for herself.

18
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,930
'She would be sexually abused
by her own stepfather.

19
00:01:51,019 --> 00:01:55,010
'Most monarchs are handed
their crowns on a plate.

20
00:01:55,099 --> 00:01:58,799
'Elizabeth got hers
by cunning and courage.

21
00:02:05,739 --> 00:02:08,770
'Elizabeth's sex
was a disappointment to Henry.

22
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,810
'Astrologers had assured him

23
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:16,568
'that the baby to be born
in September 1533 would be a boy.

24
00:02:16,658 --> 00:02:20,770
'He already had one daughter,
the 17-year-old Mary.

25
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:24,090
'What he wanted was a son and heir.

26
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:29,889
'Although Elizabeth was a girl,
the magnificent christening

27
00:02:29,979 --> 00:02:33,210
'planned for the longed-for
prince went ahead.

28
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:39,210
'Every detail had been seen to, down to
the brazier to warm the water in the font.

29
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:44,419
'She was even proclaimed "Princess",
the title of the heir to the throne.'

30
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:48,280
Elizabeth, ego te baptiso
in nomine patris

31
00:02:48,378 --> 00:02:53,688
et filii et spiritus sancti, amen.

32
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:56,848
(Starkey) 'According to
the French ambassador

33
00:02:56,938 --> 00:03:00,968
'the whole occasion was so perfect
that nothing was lacking.'

34
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:05,919
Actually things were far from perfect
at Elizabeth's baptism

35
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:09,930
because Elizabeth was the child
of a second marriage

36
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:13,449
and Henry's second marriage,
like many second marriages today,

37
00:03:13,538 --> 00:03:16,250
aroused very strong feelings.

38
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:20,370
For instance, the imperial ambassador
refused point-blank

39
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,408
to attend the baptism.

40
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,568
He even refused to recognise
Anne Boleyn, Elizabeth's mother,

41
00:03:26,658 --> 00:03:28,330
as Henry's wife.

42
00:03:28,419 --> 00:03:32,810
Instead he sneeringly
referred to her as "the whore".

43
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:37,169
And as for little Elizabeth
she was "the bastard".

44
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:39,610
Even one of the officiating clergy,

45
00:03:39,699 --> 00:03:44,610
when asked if the baby was
baptised in hot water or cold,

46
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:49,449
replied, "Hot, but not hot enough."

47
00:03:49,538 --> 00:03:53,288
'Henry divorced his first wife,
Catherine of Aragon,

48
00:03:53,378 --> 00:03:58,400
'because she had not given him a son
but now her replacement, Anne Boleyn,

49
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,530
'was having her own
gynaecological problems.

50
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:06,169
'After two miscarriages,
she had a baby boy but it was stillborn.'

51
00:04:06,258 --> 00:04:11,408
Anne had failed in her principal duty
as royal breeding machine.

52
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:16,250
Meanwhile, Henry had fallen in love
with another woman - Jane Seymour.

53
00:04:16,338 --> 00:04:19,850
For Anne the end came
with terrifying swiftness.

54
00:04:19,939 --> 00:04:22,610
She was accused of multiple adultery

55
00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:25,290
with four of the gentlemen
of the King's Chamber

56
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:28,129
and of incest with her own brother.

57
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:32,850
All of the accused were found guilty
and Anne herself was executed

58
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:38,449
here on Tower Green on 19th May 1536.

59
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:41,209
Henry showed a single gesture of mercy

60
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,129
towards the woman
that he'd once loved so much

61
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:48,850
and her head was removed
at a single stroke with a sword

62
00:04:48,939 --> 00:04:51,970
rather than being
hacked off with the axe.

63
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,769
'Elizabeth was only three

64
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:10,769
'when her mother was executed
as a traitor and a whore.

65
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:14,528
'For many children this would
have been a lifelong trauma

66
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:19,170
'but Elizabeth seems to have
airbrushed her mother from her memory.

67
00:05:22,338 --> 00:05:25,569
'It was to be Henry who filled her world.

68
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:40,170
'Anne Boleyn's fall marked a major
step down in the world for Elizabeth.'

69
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:43,850
Her parents' marriage
was declared null and void.

70
00:05:43,939 --> 00:05:48,170
She was now illegitimate
and unable to inherit the throne.

71
00:05:48,259 --> 00:05:53,850
So, instead of the Right High
and Mighty Princess

72
00:05:53,939 --> 00:05:58,050
the Lady Elizabeth,
inheritrix of the Crown of England,

73
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:04,850
she became the Lady Elizabeth,
the King's second bastard daughter.

74
00:06:04,939 --> 00:06:07,569
'Elizabeth's sudden loss of status

75
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:12,209
'threw the little court where she had been
brought up in into confusion.

76
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,970
'Even her governess, Lady Bryan,
didn't know what to do

77
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:20,610
'and wrote to the King's minister
Thomas Cromwell for guidance.'

78
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:23,329
How should the little girl be treated?

79
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:26,850
By the way, could she please
have some more clothes?

80
00:06:26,939 --> 00:06:29,449
She'd outgrown everything she had.

81
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:32,370
But above all, where should she eat?

82
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:37,250
Was she old enough to eat here
in the great hall, served on the dais,

83
00:06:37,338 --> 00:06:39,930
or should she continue
to eat in her chamber

84
00:06:40,019 --> 00:06:43,370
where it will be easier to keep her
away from the rich foods

85
00:06:43,459 --> 00:06:47,160
that were so bad
for her teeth and her digestion?

86
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:52,528
'Whatever her status
no one could forget

87
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,449
'that Elizabeth
was Anne Boleyn's daughter

88
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:59,810
'and it was in order to marry Anne
that Henry had broken away from Rome

89
00:06:59,899 --> 00:07:03,680
'and made himself
head of the church in England.

90
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:08,689
'It was a revolution and one
of its victims was the monasteries.

91
00:07:08,778 --> 00:07:12,769
'They were amongst the greatest
English landowners.

92
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:16,930
'Their assets were seized
and their buildings dismantled.

93
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:22,649
'One of them was Glastonbury Abbey,
then the largest church in England.'

94
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:32,889
When I look out from my church,
across from these ruins

95
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:35,410
I'm filled with a sense of sadness

96
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:39,009
a sense of loss
a sense of disbelief to a degree

97
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:42,720
that such destruction
could have taken place

98
00:07:42,819 --> 00:07:47,329
in a country that was supposedly
very religious and Catholic.

99
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:52,360
This abbey here
was a place of pilgrimage.

100
00:07:52,459 --> 00:07:55,449
The abbey contained
a statue of Our Lady,

101
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:58,170
which is what Catholics call St Mary.

102
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:01,129
And people would have
come from far and wide

103
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:04,009
to pay their respects,
to say their prayers,

104
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,689
to make their offerings and ask for help.

105
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:11,800
Within nine years from the Reformation,
dissolution of the monasteries

106
00:08:11,899 --> 00:08:16,730
this went from being one of our
grandest Catholic churches

107
00:08:16,819 --> 00:08:19,449
to pretty well
what we see around us today,

108
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,838
hardly one stone on top of another.

109
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:29,009
'The damage to the Catholic Church
wasn't just physical, it was spiritual too.

110
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:33,250
'Out of these ruins would grow
a new Protestant faith.

111
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:37,970
'Henry's religious revolution
would divide his country and his family.'

112
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:44,210
'Henry had now embarked
on his third marriage to Jane Seymour.

the son that he craved.

150
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,808
This means that the little girl

151

had to translate a passage
from Latin into English

152
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:39,450
and then back again into Latin
getting it absolutely right, word for word.

153

For most children this would
have been an absolute torment

154

but Elizabeth seems
to have revelled in it.

155
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:50,090
She must have had the mind
of a computer programmer

156

or an expert solver
of crossword puzzles,

157

for the whole of the rest of her life.

159
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,798
She did them for fun and for relaxation

160

but she also did them
as a kind of mental discipline

161

to keep her emotions under control,

162

00:12:27,058 --> 00:12:30,250
'No woman had ever sat on
the English throne before.

168
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:32,850
'Now, if Edward died without an heir

169
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:36,450
'first Mary and then Elizabeth
would become queen.

170
00:12:37,538 --> 00:12:40,490
'Henry then sailed for France
to fight a war

171
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:45,649
'leaving his wife, Katherine Parr,
as regent in charge of the kingdom.

172
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:48,408
'Elizabeth now witnessed at first hand

173
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:53,408
'that an intelligent, well-educated woman
could rule effectively.

174
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:58,730
'At about this time Elizabeth
acquired a new tutor, Roger Ascham.

175
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,850
'He worked with the brightest minds
at Cambridge

176
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:05,129
'but he found Elizabeth
more than their equal.'

177
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:08,450
(Reader) "The lady Elizabeth
shines like a star.

178
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:12,690
"The constitution of her mind
is exempt from female weakness.

179
00:13:12,778 --> 00:13:15,730
"No apprehension
can be quicker than hers."

180
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:18,808
'She demonstrated her abilities

181
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:23,690
'in an extraordinary
New Year's gift for her father.'

182
00:13:23,778 --> 00:13:29,730
It's a work of prose but it shows the
12-year-old girl to have been, in her way,

183
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:33,519
just as much of a child prodigy
as the young Mozart.

184
00:13:35,178 --> 00:13:39,490
It's bound in red cloth of gold,
heavily embroidered,

185
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:42,330
with Henry's initials top and bottom.

186
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:48,769
And - you can see it more clearly
on the back - in the middle, a cipher.

187
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:52,250
That's the interlaced initials for Henry

188
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:56,570
and Katherine - spelt with a K -
Katherine Parr.

189
00:13:56,658 --> 00:14:00,168
The cover's the work
of a professional embroiderer

190
00:14:00,259 --> 00:14:04,288
but inside it's all Elizabeth's own work.

191
00:14:05,538 --> 00:14:07,570
And what work.

192
00:14:07,658 --> 00:14:14,250
Page after page of perfect, beautiful,
rhythmic italic handwriting.

193
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:17,408
It shows just how far
she'd come on in a year.

194
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:21,330
Her New Year's present
of the year before to her stepmother

195
00:14:21,418 --> 00:14:26,769
is filled with mistakes, corrections
second thoughts, but here, nothing!

196
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:31,610
First the Latin
then the French, then the Italian.

197
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:35,288
Not a mistake
not a mistranslation, not a blot.

198
00:14:35,379 --> 00:14:37,570
Just perfection.

199
00:14:37,658 --> 00:14:43,528
But it's the introductory letter that really
takes us into Elizabeth's own mind.

200
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:46,080
She addresses her father.

201
00:14:46,178 --> 00:14:48,288
A very striking phrase.

202
00:14:48,379 --> 00:14:52,808
"Matchless and most kind father."

203
00:14:52,899 --> 00:14:57,570
She even has her own views on
the importance of the state of kingship,

204
00:14:57,658 --> 00:15:00,730
the state of kingship
which philosophers say

205
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:04,288
is equivalent
to that of a god upon earth.

206
00:15:05,379 --> 00:15:07,970
In love with her father, perhaps.

207
00:15:08,058 --> 00:15:11,408
Even more in love
with the idea of the monarchy.

208
00:15:15,058 --> 00:15:19,009
'Elizabeth had never been more
secure in her royal status.

209
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,610
'She basked in Henry's attention.

210
00:15:24,379 --> 00:15:28,288
'In 1546 she had
this portrait painted for him

211
00:15:28,379 --> 00:15:31,808
'and it shows her as she wished
to be seen by her father.

212
00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:35,490
'So she's studious, one finger
marking a page in a book.

213
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:40,600
'She's pious. The book open on the
lectern beside her is certainly the Bible.

214
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:44,210
'She is the virtuous
Renaissance princess.

215
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:51,769
'But this tranquillity could not last.

216
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:54,490
'Henry, her father, was dying.

217
00:15:57,019 --> 00:16:03,330
'At 13, Elizabeth was about to lose
the giant of a father whom she revered.

218
00:16:03,418 --> 00:16:07,889
'The next decade would be
the most threatening period of her life.'

219
00:16:09,379 --> 00:16:12,808
Christmas 1546
was a gloomy one at court.

220
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:15,330
For a long time
the King had suffered from

221
00:16:15,418 --> 00:16:20,168
an old jousting injury to his leg
which had turned into a chronic ulcer.

222
00:16:20,259 --> 00:16:23,330
Pus would build up
causing the leg to swell.

223
00:16:23,418 --> 00:16:25,528
'The pain was intense.

224
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:29,490
'On 30th December
Henry completed his will

225
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:31,769
'and then the descent was swift.'

226
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:36,519
As Henry lay dying in his bedchamber,

227
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:40,970
outside in the gallery, Edward Seymour,
Prince Edward's uncle

228
00:16:41,058 --> 00:16:44,168
was pacing up and down
with his advisers.

229
00:16:44,259 --> 00:16:47,769
They were plotting the takeover
of power in the new reign.

230
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:51,009
Towards two o'clock
in the morning Henry died

231
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:55,250
clutching the hands of Archbishop
Cranmer, Elizabeth's godfather.

232
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:58,610
To make sure that there was
a smooth transfer of power,

233
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:02,570
Henry's death was kept secret
for three full days.

234
00:17:02,658 --> 00:17:04,808
Finally all was ready

235
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:08,009
and Seymour brought together Edward,
now Edward VI

236
00:17:08,098 --> 00:17:10,288
and his favourite sister, Elizabeth

237
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:13,250
and told them that their father was dead.

238
00:17:13,338 --> 00:17:16,048
One account describes
how the two children

239
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:20,368
threw themselves into each other's arms
weeping uncontrollably.

240
00:17:22,058 --> 00:17:26,170
'Little King Edward VI
had stepped into his father's shoes

241
00:17:26,259 --> 00:17:29,210
'but they were several sizes
too big for him.

242
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,490
'He was just nine years old

243
00:17:31,578 --> 00:17:35,690
'and to begin with he was the pawn
of his powerful royal councillors.

244
00:17:36,818 --> 00:17:40,568
'And so was Elizabeth.
Her father's will had left her rich

245
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:44,808
'and her place in the line of the
succession made her a tempting target.

246
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:49,730
'One man in particular,
Thomas Seymour, had his eyes on her.

247
00:17:55,818 --> 00:17:59,130
'The Seymour brothers,
as uncles to the young King,

248
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:02,130
'were the most powerful family
in the land.

249
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:06,528
'Thomas was bitterly jealous,
of his elder brother, Edward

250
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:11,450
'because Edward had made himself
Duke of Somerset and Lord Protector.

251
00:18:13,098 --> 00:18:16,210
'Edward built
Berry Pomeroy Castle in Devon.

252
00:18:16,298 --> 00:18:19,450
'It's still owned by his descendant,
John Seymour.'

253
00:18:23,578 --> 00:18:29,288
Thomas, I think, was a wonderfully
flamboyant and colourful character.

254
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:32,048
Like his brother he was very ambitious

255
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:36,250
and he took most of the opportunities
that were presented to him.

256
00:18:36,338 --> 00:18:40,170
He was headstrong, he probably
didn't think a great deal

257
00:18:40,259 --> 00:18:44,038
about what was going to happen
as a result of his actions.

258
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:47,608
But he was undoubtedly
out to favour himself

259
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:51,690
and make the most of his opportunities
in his life, which he did.

260
00:18:51,778 --> 00:18:55,048
(Starkey) 'Thomas plotted
his advancement to power

261
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:58,890
'from his base at Sudeley Castle
in Gloucestershire.'

262
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:04,078
His first idea was to marry
one of Henry VIII's daughters.

263
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,690
Either Mary or Elizabeth
would have done

264
00:19:06,778 --> 00:19:08,769
but the council vetoed that idea.

265
00:19:08,858 --> 00:19:11,210
So Seymour went for the next best thing

266
00:19:11,298 --> 00:19:14,210
and proposed to Henry's widow -
Katherine Parr.

267
00:19:14,298 --> 00:19:18,769
Katherine had been passionately in love
with him before she married Henry,

268
00:19:18,858 --> 00:19:21,450
so she accepted him like a shot.

269
00:19:21,538 --> 00:19:23,920
Elizabeth was living with Katherine,

270
00:19:24,019 --> 00:19:27,528
so this meant that Seymour
wasn't only her stepfather,

271
00:19:27,618 --> 00:19:29,970
he was also her guardian.

272
00:19:30,058 --> 00:19:34,288
It was a position of trust
which he abused shockingly.

273
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:42,038
'At first Katherine Parr's involvement

274
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:45,288
'made Seymour's games
seem innocent enough.

275
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:48,848
'Elizabeth found Seymour
an intriguing playmate.

276
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:53,009
'He was 40 and she was just 14.

277
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:14,930
'But Seymour saw
a relationship with Elizabeth

278
00:20:15,019 --> 00:20:17,890
'as a means of drawing
closer to the throne.

279
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:20,170
'His game grew darker.

280
00:20:36,578 --> 00:20:39,890
'Katherine Parr
was deceived by these antics

281
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:42,538
'but Kat Ashley was worried.'

282
00:20:42,618 --> 00:20:44,848
"He romped with her in the garden

283
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:47,650
"and cut her gown
into a hundred pieces."

284
00:21:09,259 --> 00:21:13,009
'Seymour now got hold
of the key to Elizabeth's bedroom.

285
00:21:13,098 --> 00:21:17,410
'He would come into her room
partly dressed, early in the morning.

286
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:21,009
'Sometimes he would tickle her
and slap her buttocks.'

287
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,009
Good morning, my lady.

288
00:21:57,098 --> 00:22:02,368
Elizabeth was confused by Seymour's
behaviour and by her reaction to it.

289
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:05,769
Seymour was a handsome,
sexually charged man

290
00:22:05,858 --> 00:22:10,288
and she was flattered by his attentions
but she was also scared by them.

291
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:13,088
So she would behave
as though it was all a game

292
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:16,170
and play hide-and-seek
behind the bed's curtains.

293
00:22:16,259 --> 00:22:18,410
'On other occasions she would react

294
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:21,608
'as though her maidenly modesty
had been outraged.'

295
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,848
She'd get up early
and make sure that she was dressed

296
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:27,288
so as to avoid Seymour's attentions.

297
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:30,890
On the other hand, Kat Ashley,
Elizabeth's governess,

298
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,930
knew exactly what was going on.

299
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:37,170
But when she reproved Seymour
for risking Elizabeth's reputation,

300
00:22:37,259 --> 00:22:39,088
he brazened it out.

301
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:42,170
He'd no intention of stopping
his behaviour, he said

302
00:22:42,259 --> 00:22:45,410
because he meant no harm by it.

303
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,490
'But when Katherine Parr
became pregnant

304
00:22:49,578 --> 00:22:53,650
'Seymour's flirtation
with Elizabeth grew more serious.

305
00:23:07,338 --> 00:23:11,650
'At first Katherine could not
believe what was happening.

306
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:14,650
'Finally she was left in no doubt.'

307
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:18,210
(Parr) My lord?

308
00:23:18,298 --> 00:23:20,048
Your Grace.

309
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:25,210
'Following a painful interview,
during which Elizabeth hardly spoke,

310
00:23:25,298 --> 00:23:27,730
'her stepmother sent her away.

311
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:34,288
'It was the last time
Elizabeth saw Katherine.

312
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,838
'When she moved to Sudeley
to have the baby,

313
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:39,808
'Elizabeth wrote to her wishing her luck.

314
00:23:41,818 --> 00:23:45,519
'But Katherine died
shortly after the birth of her child

315
00:23:45,618 --> 00:23:48,368
'and she was buried here at Sudeley.'

316
00:23:51,778 --> 00:23:55,250
In her final delirium
all her fears and jealousies

317
00:23:55,338 --> 00:23:59,410
about Seymour's behaviour
had revived, with very good reason,

318
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:03,328
because Seymour soon renewed
his suit to marry Elizabeth

319
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:07,328
and this time he had
the powerful backing of Kat Ashley.

320
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:09,980
Elizabeth herself was enthusiastic

321
00:24:10,058 --> 00:24:14,288
but she'd the good sense to say
that she wouldn't consider the marriage

322
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:16,650
without the backing of the council.

323
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:21,048
Seymour for his part,
hot-headed and impetuous as usual,

324
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:23,440
was too impatient to wait.

325
00:24:23,538 --> 00:24:30,930
Thomas was becoming more and more
keen to attain some personal power

326
00:24:31,019 --> 00:24:33,288
and to further his career.

327
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:38,568
One way of doing this was
to get Edward, the young king,

328
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:40,608
completely on his side.

329
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:47,170
I think he decided he was going
to actually abduct the King

330
00:24:47,259 --> 00:24:52,650
and as he lived in the neighbouring
apartment it was very easy for him

331
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:56,890
to have conversations
and meetings with the young King.

332
00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:01,009
How it happened
I don't think is really clear

333
00:25:01,098 --> 00:25:05,490
but we do know that he was found
in the King's apartment

334
00:25:05,578 --> 00:25:07,608
with a sword in his hand.

335
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:13,880
One of the many spaniels
the young King had started to bark

336
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:18,650
and, I suppose, in desperation
Thomas ran it through with his sword

337
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:21,528
and there was a great kerfuffle and noise

338
00:25:21,618 --> 00:25:24,650
and people burst in
and Thomas was arrested.

339
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:27,970
(Starkey) 'Seymour
was charged with treason.

340
00:25:28,058 --> 00:25:31,759

made her a suspect too.

00:25:31,858 --> 00:25:34,848
'A team of interrogators
descended on Hatfield

00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:38,930
'to discover whether
she'd been plotting with him.

00:25:39,019 --> 00:25:44,088
'Her closest confidante, Kat Ashley,
was arrested and taken to the Tower.

'Under threat of torture

00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:50,048

events of the previous summer.

word for word against Elizabeth.'

347

"Another time at Hanworth
he romped with her in the garden."

348
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:03,328
"Romped."

"she assured me
she could not strive withal

"The Queen, suspecting the often access
of the Admiral to the Lady Elizabeth...

'She complained bitterly to Somerset.'

"I shall most heartily desire
that I may come to the court

00:27:11,019 --> 00:27:13,690
"that I may show myself as I am."

365
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:22,890
'Tyrwhitt told Somerset
he was sure she was guilty

366
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,930
'but he could prove nothing.

367
00:27:25,019 --> 00:27:27,250
'Elizabeth had survived the crisis.

368
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:35,368
'But Seymour's guilt was clear.

369
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:39,808
'In March 1549 Somerset signed
his brother's death warrant

370
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:43,250
'and Seymour was beheaded
on Tower Hill.'

371
00:27:46,618 --> 00:27:51,769
Elizabeth's brush with Thomas Seymour
marked a turning point in her young life.

372
00:27:51,858 --> 00:27:57,650
It was a brutal initiation into the world
of adult politics and adult sexuality.

373
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:01,250
She'd learned the hard way
that a sexual relationship,

374
00:28:01,338 --> 00:28:06,009
even a close friendship,
might mean danger, perhaps death.

375
00:28:06,098 --> 00:28:08,890
She knew now
that when a man approached her

376
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:12,088
he'd got his eyes on the throne
as much as on her.

377
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:17,490
'From this point onwards
she trusted almost nobody.

378
00:28:17,578 --> 00:28:21,769
'She kept her own counsel
and she concealed her true faults.

379
00:28:21,858 --> 00:28:25,480
'It was her defence
against a hostile world.

380
00:28:37,578 --> 00:28:41,970
'Elizabeth was left alone
in the peaceful solitude of Hatfield.

381
00:28:42,058 --> 00:28:45,048
'Here she continued her studies.

382
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:48,759
'She also indulged a passion
for riding and hunting.

383
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:55,528
'The clean air and exercise
were a welcome antidote

384
00:28:55,618 --> 00:29:00,410
'to the headaches and sickness that
had plagued her during the investigation

385
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:05,130
'and would recur throughout her life
during moments of stress.'

386
00:29:18,818 --> 00:29:22,769
At about this time Elizabeth's,
French tutor, John Bellmain

387
00:29:22,858 --> 00:29:27,798
gave her as a present his translation
of St Basil's epistle to St Gregory

388
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:30,130
on the virtues of the single life.

389
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:34,000
The saint's argument was that
marriage distracted the soul

390
00:29:34,098 --> 00:29:36,048
from the worship of God.

391
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:39,368
Bearing in mind her experiences
with Thomas Seymour,

392
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:45,048
Elizabeth was well aware of the practical,
political advantages of celibacy too.

393
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:47,808
It was the same with
the saint's arguments

394
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:50,769
about temperance and sobriety of dress.

395
00:29:50,858 --> 00:29:53,568
Elizabeth created a sensation at court

396
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:57,848
by turning up with her hair straight,
face unmade-up

397
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:00,400
and virtually no jewellery.

398
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:05,210
She was rehabilitating herself
after the disaster of the Seymour affair

399
00:30:05,298 --> 00:30:07,890
by playing the Quaker maid.

400
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:11,490
'There was more to it than just image.

401
00:30:11,578 --> 00:30:15,808
'Elizabeth was caught up
in the new Protestant mood in England.

402
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:18,608
'The crosses and candles
of the Catholic faith

403
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:21,410
'were being stripped from altars
everywhere.

404
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,450
'The new faith had
the enthusiastic backing

405
00:30:24,538 --> 00:30:27,730
'of Elizabeth's brother
the young King Edward'.

406
00:30:27,818 --> 00:30:33,170
'But by 1553 the 15-year-old King
was dying of tuberculosis.

407
00:30:33,259 --> 00:30:37,288
'He was desperate to stop
the religious reforms being undone

408
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,328
'by his Catholic sister Mary,

409
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:43,288
'who would succeed under
the terms of their father's will.

410
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:48,009
'So he excluded her from the succession
because she was a bastard.

411
00:30:48,098 --> 00:30:51,450
'But if Mary was a bastard
so too was Elizabeth.

412
00:30:51,538 --> 00:30:56,088
'Instead, Edward chose
a Protestant cousin to succeed him

413
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:59,170
'the 15-year-old Lady Jane Grey.

414
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:05,130
'Anxiously, Elizabeth waited
with her armed followers at Hatfield

415
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:07,598
'to see what would happen next.

416
00:31:10,259 --> 00:31:13,650
'In July 1553 Edward died.

417
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:16,368
'Lady Jane Grey was proclaimed queen

418
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:20,130
'and Elizabeth and Mary
were denounced as bastards.

419
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:22,970
'But Mary was Henry's elder daughter

420
00:31:23,058 --> 00:31:26,759
'and in the eyes of the people
she was rightful queen.

421
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:32,650
'She was supported
by many of England's leading families.

422
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:36,358
'Sir Henry Bedingfeld,
a substantial Norfolk landowner

423
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:39,568
'was one of the first
to rally to Mary's banner.

424
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:42,970
'His descendant
still lives at Oxburgh Hall.'

425
00:31:43,058 --> 00:31:48,970
Sir Henry, at Oxburgh,
gathered together 160 men

426
00:31:49,058 --> 00:31:51,730
armed, as they say, cap-a-pie,

427
00:31:51,818 --> 00:31:54,848
,
that is to say
with a certain amount of armour

428
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:57,608
leather jerkins, swords, certainly

429
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,930
and, I'm sure, a few horses.

430
00:32:02,338 --> 00:32:08,680
'His role was to take this small group
of people to, first of all, Kenning Hall

431
00:32:08,778 --> 00:32:13,088
'where other units such as his
were joining up to make an army

432
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:18,730
'and from there to Framlingham
where the army swelled.'

433
00:32:18,818 --> 00:32:23,838
And they marched from there
to London with Queen Mary.

434
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:26,568
Princess Elizabeth joined them en route.

435
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:32,690
As custom dictated, at the gates of the
city of London they left the army behind

436
00:32:32,778 --> 00:32:36,528
and Elizabeth and Mary
rode into the city of London

437
00:32:36,618 --> 00:32:40,210
to wild rejoicing
and cheers from the crowd.

438
00:32:40,298 --> 00:32:44,328
(Starkey) 'In the face
of this overwhelming support for Mary

439
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,410
'the opposition collapsed.

440
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:50,650
'Lady Jane Grey was later
beheaded at the Tower.

441
00:32:52,058 --> 00:32:57,368
'On July 19th 1553
Mary was proclaimed Queen.

442
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:02,009
'Her vision was to lead England back
to the true Catholic faith.

443
00:33:02,098 --> 00:33:07,088
'Elizabeth's Protestantism
marked her out as a potential enemy.'

444
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,798
For the first two months of Mary's reign

445
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:13,490
Elizabeth contrived to avoid
going to Mass.

446
00:33:13,578 --> 00:33:16,088
Finally Mary issued an ultimatum.

447
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:19,288
Elizabeth was to attend Mass
on the 8th September,

448
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:22,210
the day of the Nativity
of the Blessed Virgin.

449
00:33:22,298 --> 00:33:27,769
Cornered at last, Elizabeth sought
an interview with Mary at Richmond.

450
00:33:27,858 --> 00:33:31,088
She threw herself
on her knees before the Queen

451
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:33,210
tears streaming down her face.

452
00:33:33,298 --> 00:33:36,690
She explained that she'd never
been taught the old faith

453
00:33:36,778 --> 00:33:39,730
and could she have priests
to instruct her?

454
00:33:39,818 --> 00:33:42,930
Oh, yes, and she would go to Mass.

455
00:33:43,019 --> 00:33:46,720
But on the morning
she developed a diplomatic chill

456
00:33:46,818 --> 00:33:50,088
and rather spoiled
the solemnity of the occasion

457
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:53,170
by complaining, loudly,
of a bad stomach.

458
00:33:53,259 --> 00:33:57,450
Neither Mary nor anyone else
was deceived.

459
00:33:57,538 --> 00:34:02,730
Mary and Elizabeth had different
attitudes to their religions.

460
00:34:02,818 --> 00:34:05,170
Mary, of the old religion,

461
00:34:05,259 --> 00:34:10,380
would have had a slightly mechanistic
expression of her religion.

462
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:14,289
Not that she wasn't devout
and spiritual, I'm sure she was,

463
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:17,090
but her religion involved doing things,

464
00:34:17,179 --> 00:34:21,489
pilgrimages, saying the rosary,
making signs of the cross.

465
00:34:21,579 --> 00:34:26,730
'For Elizabeth, those things
didn't feature in her faith.

466
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:31,050
People of the new religion would have
been much more Bible-based

467
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:35,329
and would have interpreted the Bible
in the light of their own reason,

468
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:38,329
rather than relying on
an authority from Rome

469
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:40,570
telling them what the Bible meant.

470
00:34:41,659 --> 00:34:45,768
(Starkey) 'Mary now tried to guarantee
the Catholic future of England

471

00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:53,170
'But Mary's passionate love for
a foreign prince was deeply unpopular

473
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:56,610
'and Philip's envoys
were pelted with snowballs.

'Mary brushed aside the protests.

00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:49,090
'She was writing for her life.'

499
00:36:52,059 --> 00:36:54,329
"I most humbly beseech Your Majesty

500
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:57,960
"that I be not condemned
without answer and due proof

501
00:36:58,059 --> 00:37:00,250
"which it seems that I now am.

502
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:04,650
"For without cause proved
I am commanded to go to the Tower,

503
00:37:04,739 --> 00:37:09,530
"a place more wanted for a false traitor
than a true subject."

504
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:12,610
'This is the letter that Elizabeth writes

505
00:37:12,699 --> 00:37:15,260
'at this most desperate
moment of her life.'

506
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:19,210
She begins with a fine, firm, clear hand

507
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:23,050
but gradually, as the pressure
of circumstances gets to her -

508
00:37:23,139 --> 00:37:28,690
remember, she thought that she'd only
days before she was executed -

509
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:32,050
the handwriting becomes looser
and more irregular.

510
00:37:32,139 --> 00:37:34,969
She makes mistakes
and then she corrects them.

511
00:37:35,059 --> 00:37:39,570
But finally she's run out of things
to say and time to say them in

512
00:37:39,659 --> 00:37:44,289
and still she's only a quarter
of the way down the second page.

513
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:47,170
Then, as a primitive security device

514
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:50,010
to stop anybody
forging her handwriting

515
00:37:50,099 --> 00:37:53,369
and making incriminating
additions to the letter

516
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:57,809
she draws long diagonal strokes
that almost fill up the page.

517
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:01,518
'They leave just space
at the bottom for a postscript.'

518
00:38:01,619 --> 00:38:05,320
"'I humbly crave but
only one word with yourself."

519
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:07,570
'It summarises the entire letter.

520
00:38:07,659 --> 00:38:10,849
'And then at the right she signs off.

521
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:15,800
"'Your Highness's most faithful
subject from the beginning

522
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,730
"'and shall be to my end."'

523
00:38:19,739 --> 00:38:22,690
Elizabeth's letter was a long one.

524
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:26,170
Deliberately so, because
by the time she had finished

525
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:28,210
the tide was too high

526
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:32,000
for a boat to be able to make
the journey safely to the Tower.

527
00:38:32,099 --> 00:38:35,449
She'd bought herself
a few precious hours

528
00:38:35,539 --> 00:38:37,489
but to no avail.

529
00:38:37,579 --> 00:38:40,289
Mary didn't even deign to reply.

530
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:46,768
'Early the next morning Elizabeth
was rowed up the river to the Tower.

531
00:38:50,219 --> 00:38:52,849
'The rain was falling in a steady drizzle.

532
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:57,480
'Elizabeth knew that most of those
who made this voyage

533
00:38:57,579 --> 00:38:59,570
'would never make another.'

534
00:39:10,018 --> 00:39:13,250
When Elizabeth landed
the river was very high

535
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:15,768
and the steps were very slippery.

536
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:18,530
She found it difficult to keep her feet.

537
00:39:18,619 --> 00:39:22,369
She found it even more difficult
to control her terror.

538
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:27,409
"I never thought
to come here a prisoner.

539
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:30,610
"I beseech you all,
my friends and fellows,

540
00:39:30,699 --> 00:39:34,130
"bear witness that I come here no traitor

541
00:39:34,219 --> 00:39:39,409
"but as true a subject to the Queen's
majesty as any now alive."

542
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:42,730
At the top of the steps
stood the soldiers.

543
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:44,809
They were there to guard her.

544
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:50,409
Instead they fell on their knees crying,
"God save Your Grace!"

545
00:40:08,059 --> 00:40:10,210
This is the room in the bell tower

546
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:13,809
where Elizabeth is supposed
to have been imprisoned.

547
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:16,929
The eight weeks
of her captivity in the Tower

548
00:40:17,018 --> 00:40:19,579
were the darkest days of her entire life.

549
00:40:19,659 --> 00:40:23,768
As so often happened at moments
of psychological crisis she fell ill.

550
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:26,570
She thought constantly of death.

551
00:40:26,659 --> 00:40:29,730
After all, she was only
a few yards from the spot

552
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:32,409
where her mother had been executed.

553
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:35,570
She prayed to be delivered
from the same fate.

554
00:40:35,659 --> 00:40:37,849
'Two months dragged by.

555
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:40,449
'Still there was no word from Mary.

556
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:44,130
'Elizabeth could only expect the worst.

557
00:40:45,579 --> 00:40:48,889
'On the morning of 19th May 1554

558
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:51,969
'Sir Henry Bedingfield,
Mary's staunch supporter,

559
00:40:52,059 --> 00:40:54,518
'arrived at the Tower with 100 men.

560
00:41:01,219 --> 00:41:04,530
'Elizabeth believed
that she was about to die

561
00:41:04,619 --> 00:41:07,969
'and from Mary's point of view
she deserved to.

562
00:41:08,059 --> 00:41:11,730
'Mary knew that she had been
involved in the Wyatt plot

563
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:14,809
'but Elizabeth had cleverly
covered her tracks.

564
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,849
'Without positive proof

565
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:20,690
'Mary couldn't risk executing
the heir to the throne.

566
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:26,010
'Bedingfield took Elizabeth
to Woodstock Palace near Oxford.'

567
00:41:26,099 --> 00:41:29,570
The relationship that
Elizabeth had with Sir Henry

568
00:41:29,659 --> 00:41:33,969
was, from Sir Henry's point of
view, a very professional one.

569
00:41:34,059 --> 00:41:37,969
From her point of view,
I should think thoroughly frustrating

570
00:41:38,059 --> 00:41:41,369
because he was there
with a bunch of keys

571
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:45,650
and he kept her locked in.
The garden gates were locked.

572
00:41:45,739 --> 00:41:50,599
If she wanted to go for a walk someone
had to accompany her, an armed guard.

573
00:41:50,699 --> 00:41:54,969
She couldn't receive anything
in case there were messages involved

574
00:41:55,059 --> 00:41:59,730
and she, in fact, called him, "my jailer".

575
00:42:02,579 --> 00:42:05,929
(Starkey) 'Elizabeth was locked up
for almost a year

576
00:42:06,018 --> 00:42:07,969
'before Mary summoned her.

577
00:42:08,059 --> 00:42:10,730
'The Queen believed
that she was pregnant

578
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:14,889
'and she wanted Elizabeth
to play a part in the christening.

579
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:19,090
'But it was a phantom pregnancy
and as his wife sickened

580
00:42:19,179 --> 00:42:22,250
'Philip's attitude to Elizabeth changed.

581
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:26,010
'He thought that he could use her
to keep control of England

582
00:42:26,099 --> 00:42:28,480
'by marrying her to a friend.'

583
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:39,730
In the autumn of 1555 Elizabeth
got Mary's permission to leave court

584
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:44,840
and to come here to the peace and
security of her country estate at Hatfield.

585
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:46,889
She wanted to escape the court

586
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:51,130
with its poisonous atmosphere
of intrigue and surveillance.

587
00:42:51,219 --> 00:42:54,449
But she also wished
to put a metaphorical distance

588
00:42:54,539 --> 00:42:58,369
between herself and Mary's government
because that summer

589
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:01,570
the burning of Protestants
had really got underway.

590
00:43:10,099 --> 00:43:15,889
'More than 300 people met
this horrible death during Mary's reign.

591
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:17,929
'A few were lucky.

592
00:43:18,018 --> 00:43:22,090
'Kind executioners would tie
bags of gunpowder to their legs

593
00:43:22,179 --> 00:43:24,449
'to finish them off quickly.

594
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:27,969
'Most roasted alive.

595
00:43:30,659 --> 00:43:34,409
'Every death created a martyr
for the Protestant cause.

596
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:37,969
'Making England Catholic
wasn't going to be easy.

597
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:44,889
'Sensing that her time was near

598
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:47,809
'Elizabeth fiercely resisted Philip's plans

599
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:51,929
'to marry her off to a Catholic prince,
the Duke of Savoy.

600
00:43:52,018 --> 00:43:54,579
'She would be no one's puppet.

601
00:44:03,619 --> 00:44:09,449
'Mary was dying but still she resisted
naming Elizabeth as her successor.

602
00:44:09,539 --> 00:44:12,768
'Ten days before her death
she finally relented

603
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:15,159
'under pressure from her council.'

604
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:20,170
It was 17th November 1558.

605
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:23,449
Towards noon
messengers arrived at Hatfield

606
00:44:23,539 --> 00:44:27,079
to inform Elizabeth
that her sister Mary was dead

607
00:44:27,179 --> 00:44:29,329
and that she was now Queen.

608
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:33,369
The story goes that they found
her walking in the park

609
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:35,840
underneath a great oak tree.

610
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:40,050
As they fell on their knees before her
she too knelt

611
00:44:40,139 --> 00:44:42,730
uttering the words of the 118th psalm,

612
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:48,650
"A Domino factum est
et mirabile in oculis nostris."

613
00:44:48,739 --> 00:44:53,599
"This is the Lord's doing
and it is marvellous in our eyes."

614
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:02,969
'The Spanish ambassador, De Feria,

615
00:45:03,059 --> 00:45:08,650
'told Elizabeth she owed her throne
not to the lord but to King Philip.

616
00:45:08,739 --> 00:45:11,039
'Elizabeth would have none of it.'

617
00:45:11,139 --> 00:45:14,090
(Reader) "She is a very vain
and clever woman.

618
00:45:14,179 --> 00:45:18,849
"She puts great store by all the people
who put her in her present position

619
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:23,449
"and she will not acknowledge
that Your Majesty had any part in it.

620
00:45:23,539 --> 00:45:26,530
"She is determined
to be governed by no one."

621
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:32,809
On Wednesday 23rd November,

622
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:37,489
Elizabeth rode through these great gates
of the Charterhouse in London

623
00:45:37,579 --> 00:45:39,929
to take possession of her capital.

624
00:45:40,018 --> 00:45:44,489
Her journey from Hatfield had
turned into a triumphal progress.

625
00:45:44,579 --> 00:45:47,170
She was accompanied with a great train

626
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:50,250
of a thousand lords
ladies and gentlemen!

627
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:54,610
and vast, cheering crowds
greeted her arrival.

628
00:45:57,579 --> 00:46:01,199
'Elizabeth consulted
the astrologer Dr John Dee

629
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:07,050
'before choosing Sunday 15th January
1559 for her coronation.

630
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:11,849
'The Queen walked along
lengths of blue cloth

631
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:15,929
'from Westminster Hall
to the entrance to Westminster Abbey.

632
00:46:16,018 --> 00:46:21,090
'The crowds behind her fell on the cloth
cutting off pieces as souvenirs.'

633
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:30,809
Today Elizabeth would play the part
that she had understudied so long -

634
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:32,849
and in what a setting.

635
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:36,449
Her christening at Greenwich
had been high theatre

636
00:46:36,539 --> 00:46:39,289
but her coronation in Westminster Abbey

637
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:42,530
would be a performance
on the grandest scale.

638
00:46:50,739 --> 00:46:55,369
First Elizabeth was acclaimed
by the people and swore the oath.

639
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:57,760
Next her outer robes were removed

640
00:46:57,860 --> 00:47:00,849
and she knelt, solemnly,
for the anointing.

641
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:05,170
Bishop Oglethorpe anointed her
in the seven traditional places -

642
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:08,289
shoulder blades
breasts, palms of the hand

643
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:10,760
and finally on the crown of the head.

644
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:12,809
Then she was enthroned.

645
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:29,929
'Successively three different
crowns were put on her head

646
00:47:30,018 --> 00:47:32,889
'and, on her fourth finger, a ring

647
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:38,099
'as a symbol of the mystical marriage
between Elizabeth and her kingdom.'

648
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:49,489
Tradition, mystery and symbolism

649
00:47:49,579 --> 00:47:53,530
had made her Queen of England
as fully and completely

650
00:47:53,619 --> 00:47:57,289
as any of her predecessors
had been king.

651
00:48:18,619 --> 00:48:21,610
Elizabeth at last wore the crown.

652
00:48:21,699 --> 00:48:23,969
Now came the difficult bit.

653
00:48:24,059 --> 00:48:27,679
She had to show that she could
grasp the reality of power

654
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:30,159
and govern a divided country.

655
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:34,969
To do that she had to disprove
two widespread assumptions -

656
00:48:35,059 --> 00:48:39,250
that no monarch could ever match
the achievement of her father

657
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:42,929
and that no woman could ever
make an effective ruler.
