"Beautiful stranger,
red hair, green jump suit,

2
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,389
walking dogs
in Washington Square Park."

3
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,910
"Can't forget you. Give love a chance.
Blackie."

4
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,951
Hope she gives him a chance.

5
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,992
Oh, Roberta, please!
He must be some kind of a pervert!

6
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,192
- He could be sincere.
- Nobody named Blackie is sincere.

7
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,629
He can't forget her, he's in love.
It's great.

8
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,671
Weren't you reading the want ads?

9
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:33,190
I know, I was.
I just... can't seem to find anything.

10
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,470
Don't settle for anything under 50,000.

11
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,909
- Hi, ladies!
- Hi, Adrian. What do you think?

12
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,271
- Roberta, the look is you.
- I just really wanted a trim.

13
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,356
No, this is your birthday present.

14
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,675
Give her something different, not weird...

15
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,360
Don't worry. Her husband'll love it.

16
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,477
Wow, here it is! A message from Jim!

17
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,955
"Desperately seeking Susan.
Keep the faith."

18
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,038
"Tuesday 10am. Battery Park,
Gangway one. Love Jim."

19
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,515
- Who's Jim?
- Oh, God, that's tomorrow.

20
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,551
Who's Susan? You know these people?

21
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,319
No. Jim follows Susan
all over the country.

22
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,989
Last January she was in Mexico City,
then Seattle.

23
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,078
They send messages back and forth,
that's how they hook up.

24
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,077
Now they're in New York.

25
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,476
Desperate. I love that word.
It's so romantic.

26
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,319
Everybody I know is desperate
except you.

27
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,396
- I'm desperate.
- You?

28
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,556
Well... sort of.

29
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,796
Room service!

30
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,876
It's open!

31
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,913
Smile.

32
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,314
- Hi.
- Hi.

33
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,715
I got you a newspaper and your tequila.

34
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,035
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

35
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,914
- Where do you want it?
- That's fine.

36
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,151
Don't spend it all in one place.

37
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,714
I won't. Thanks.

38
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,757
Jimmy!

39
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,836
It's about time!

40
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,796
Nice!

41
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,636
Bye-bye, Bruce.

42
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,716
It was fun, huh?

43
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,510
Hold the elevator!

44
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,596
Wait a second!

45
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,159
Roberta, don't let me eat these.
They're so good!

46
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,236
Hey, I think I've found one.

47
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,715
- One of what?
- upstairs. Come on.

48
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,235
He's been giving me the eye all night.

49
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,112
- Who is he?
- Who?

50
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,913
- In the corner, near Gary.
- Larry Stillman.

51
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,395
- Dr Stillman.
- Plastic surgery?

52
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,476
He's Gary's dentist.

53
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,591
Well, at least he's not a PhD.

54
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,077
- Gary, who's your friend?
- You know Becky.

55
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,156
Oh! Larry Stillman...

56
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,475
- My sister Leslie.
- Hi, how you doin'?

57
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,830
So you're a dentist...

58
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,078
Oh! Time out, everybody!

59
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,077
I've got a 10.58 spot.

60
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,997
- Oh, right!
- Great!

61
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,479
Rosemary will have another instalment
of Growing up In Queens.

62
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,556
The search continues for suspects

63
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,478
in the recent robbery
of ancient Egyptian artefacts.

64
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,990
That and more, next on the news at 11.

65
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:40,076
Hi. I'm Gary from Gary's Oasis.

66
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,829
In our New Jersey showroom,
we have hundreds of models

67
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:48,272
of whirlpools and hot tubs
at the lowest manufacturer-to-you prices.

68
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,356
So come on out to Gary's Oasis.

69
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:54,678
- We're open seven days a week.
- Hey, Gary. Come on in!

70
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:05,155
At Gary's Oasis
all your fantasies can come true!

71
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,116
Very good!

72
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,310
It's gone for ever.

73
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,353
That funny, young, lost look... I loved.

74
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,036
It won't ever come back.

75
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,600
I killed that
when I told you about Rebecca.

76
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:27,156
You can watch in the bedroom
with the headphones.

77
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,236
I know.

78
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,239
Gary,

79
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,238
do you ever remember your dreams?

80
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,316
I dunno, I never thought about it.

81
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,715
They liked the commercial,
don't you think?

82
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,195
Everyone thought you were great.

83
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,112
Oh, you're gonna...

84
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,277
pick up the radio for the car
for me tomorrow, aren't you?

85
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,753
Sure.

86
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,836
Oh, don't forget...

87
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:56,592
Tell the guy you're my wife because we
put a sauna in the owner's apartment

88
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,188
and he's giving us a really great price.

89
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,231
Night, hon.

90
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,351
Hey! Don't eat all that cake!

91
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,632
- Susan!
- Hi.

92
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,274
My God, we all thought you were dead!

93
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,356
No, just in New Jersey.

94
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:27,268
Let's hear it, ladies and gentlemen,
for lan, the fabulous lan,

95
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,550
and his lovely assistant Crystal!

96
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,351
Hi.

97
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,313
- Susan! Where have you been?
- All over.

98
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,396
- Anybody I know?
- No.

99
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,476
Some guy from Atlantic City.

100
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,194
It was fun till he started getting serious.

101
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,710
- How's tricks?
- I'm ready to quit this dump. I really am.

102
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,751
Ray won't let me wear my glasses,

103
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,553
then lan gets pissed off
when I can't do the tricks.

104
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,636
I mean, I'm only legally blind!

105
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,479
I could understand
if I wore my glasses on my tits,

106
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,511
but nobody here looks at my face!

107
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,074
Come on, let's just get outta here.

108
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,073
- I have to do the Disappearing Bluebird.
- Sounds great.

109
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,156
- Can't you wait?
- I'm really tired.

110
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,396
I could get some pizza
and meet you at home.

111
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,512
- You've got a place?
- Not exactly.

112
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,596
But I'm working on it.

113
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,356
Oh, no. I know what's coming now.

114
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,436
Just for tonight, I promise.

115
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,516
Come on!

116
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,633
Do you promise
only seven-digit phone calls?

117
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,990
Cross my heart. You won't regret it.

118
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,876
Thanks.

119
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,797
Welcome back.

120
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,751
I'll see you later.

121
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,076
Hey, baby. Take a paper.

122
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,996
Wow, I don't believe it.

123
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,474
Shit!

124
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,711
Excuse me!

125
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,354
- You got a light?
- No, I don't smoke.

126
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,673
Susan!

127
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,238
How come you split
without saying goodbye in person?

128
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,476
Everybody says goodbye in person.

129
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,196
Come on. Let's go get a drink.

130
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,834
Yeah, OK,
but I've only got a few minutes.

131
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,315
- Oh, great...
- It's a last-minute thing.

132
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,398
The band got this gig in Buffalo
and we start tonight.

133
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,750
Next time don't put
an ad in the paper, OK?

134
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,917
Susan, I've been looking for you
for weeks!

135
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,951
Come to Buffalo with me?

136
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,991
No, you'll be working.

137
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,475
- It's boring.
- Come to Buffalo.

138
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,797
I'll find some trouble
for you to get into.

139
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,876
I've had enough trouble already.

140
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,951
You... you were with this guy?

141
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,957
He was breathing when I left.

142
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,868
Hey! Beauty and the Beast,
we'll hit traffic on the bridge. Let's fly!

143
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,636
I don't like leaving you like this.

144
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:07,150
- I can take care of myself.
- I know.

145
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,714
Look, I'll give you a number.

146
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,436
You got a pen?

147
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,912
All right, this is the number
of my friend Dez.

148
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,996
He's a great guy

149
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,829
and if you really get in a jam, call him.
He'll know how to reach me.

150
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:26,714
- Has he got any money?
- Forget it! He knows all about you.

151
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,796
No more dead bodies, OK?

152
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,876
I'll see what I can do.

153
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,990
Be here next time when I get back.

154
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,516
Come on, baby!

155
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,029
Check it out!

156
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:36,470
Hey, baby, I got
a pair of sunglasses just for you!

157
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,316
This hat'll look great on you, baby.

158
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,829
Take a look in the mirror.
Beautiful, right?

159
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,996
$10 for the set, all right? Ten bucks.

160
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,955
You gonna buy?
Hey, where you goin', babe?

161
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,469
Yo! Come back!
What are you doin' with my hat?

162
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,909
Give me my glasses, babe!
What's the matter?

163
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,270
- Oh, man! I don't believe it!
- I'm sorry.

164
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,356
What are you doin'?

165
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,755
- I'm sorry.
- What do you mean, "sorry"? Hey!

166
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,074
Sorry!

167
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,993
Do me a favour, baby.
Stay on the carpet, OK?

168
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,554
- They're great, aren't they?
- I know.

169
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,196
I gotta have 'em, but 65 bucks...

170
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,356
- That is the price.
- Forget it.

171
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:29,109
- I like the jacket.
- It used to belong to Jimi Hendrix.

172
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,676
But I bet he'd love it
if I swapped it for the boots.

173
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,476
Deal.

174
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,192
Gorgeous, isn't it?

175
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,276
It used to belong to Elvis Presley.

176
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,960
- Wanna try it on?
- All right.

177
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,310
We start off with the eggs.

178
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,156
These go very fast done two by two.

179
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,236
And this you can do in the morning

180
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,315
and get it all ready for baking.

181
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,034
I'm gonna bake it and then unmould it.

182
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,156
There are your six eggs.

183
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,159
Those get beaten up a little bit
and then in goes...

184
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,157
Hello, Roberta.

185
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,157
Hello, Julia.

186
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,635
Sorry, girls. I can't stay for dinner.

187
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,433
Some guy from West Germany's
got 1500 tubs

188
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,471
he can't get through customs.

189
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,556
I gotta go have dinner with him in town.

190
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,148
It just happened.
I'm sorry. You forgive me?

191
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,196
Looks interesting too.

192
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,838
- Get a good deal on the radio?
- Radio?

193
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,589
- Car radio. You just came from the city.
- Oh, my God, the radio.

194
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,476
- You forgot the radio?
- No!

195
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,116
Yeah, right, I guess I did.

196
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,118
You could have said
you didn't want dinner. I had to rush!

197
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,151
You said you didn't go anywhere.

198
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,998
What are you wearing?

199
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:59,157
A jacket.
It used to belong to Jimi Hendrix.

200
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,910
You bought a used jacket?
What, are we poor?

201
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,996
What's going on here?

202
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,995
Roberta, I gotta run! I'm late.

203
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,190
We'll talk later, all right?

204
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,436
All right, we'll talk later?

205
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,276
Jimi Hendrix, huh?

206
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,916
You sold it?

207
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:20,071
I had a key that was important.
I got my shit inside a locker.

208
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,590
- I sold it!
- I'll leave you my name and number.

209
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,756
Good goin', stranger.

210
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,796
Well, what fuckin' stranger?

211
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,673
Festival seating. That means Portosans.

212
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:01,952
Portosans means pissing with flies.
I'm not gonna piss with flies.

213
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,470
You guys can piss in bottles.
What the hell is this? Woodstock?

214
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,310
- Projection.
- Dez, it's me. Jim.

215
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,192
Hold on a second.

216
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,996
Jesus Christ!

217
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,908
I'm stuck in Buffalo and I need a favour.
It's about Susan.

218
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:46,592
See, now some guy she met in Atlantic
City got pushed out of a hotel window.

219
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,870
This sounds wild. I'm sorry I missed it.

220
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,956
This is serious, Dez.

221
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:55,312
And now some guy's run an ad to meet
her in Battery Park, signed "a stranger".

222
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,399
It sounds weird.
Could you just go down there

223
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,317
and make sure she's OK?

224
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,274
Jim, Victoria split on me last night.
I'm in a shitty mood.

225
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,153
I'm not in the mood for being a boy scout
right now.

226
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,430
Come on, Dez.
It'll take you half an hour.

227
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,996
- Come on!
- Give me a chance here. One second.

228
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,309
- She's got to meet him at 4 o'clock.
- That's in less than an hour!

229
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,556
Jim, I got a job here, you know!

230
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,636
This one favour.

231
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,115
Even if I could get someone
to fill in for me,

232
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,310
I don't even know what she looks like.

233
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,396
Look, you can't miss her.

234
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:33,956
She's incredibly pretty,
blonde hair, uh... medium height.

235
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,355
And she's got this green and gold jacket

236
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,553
with a pyramid with an eye on top
like a dollar bill. You can't miss it.

237
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:44,753
- All right, you owe me one.
- Great. Thanks, Dez, I appreciate it.

238
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,836
OK, yeah. Bye.

239
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,956
I lived in New York all my life.

240
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,117
We used to have Chinese restaurants,
ltalian restaurants.

241
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:56,471
Now you have these sushi restaurants.
Everyone goes for sushi.

242
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,556
Sushi... I hate the stuff.

243
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:01,319
Although, I tell you,
I had some the other day.

244
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,035
I took it home, I cooked it, it wasn't bad.
It tasted like fish.

245
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,836
$9.20.

246
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,996
Here, keep the change.

247
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,157
Whoa! Hey! What is that? Hey, lady!

248
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,236
Hey! Hey, lady!

249
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,237
What is this?

250
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,191
Oh, that's cute!

251
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,676
Hi.

252
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,154
You look like I've seen you
somewhere before.

253
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:00,033
- No, I don't think so.
- Yeah, I think so.

254
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:06,035
- You doin' anything right now?
- I'm waiting for someone.

255
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,392
- Come with me, miss.
- I have to meet someone.

256
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,353
- We'll talk about it in the car.
- She's got all my stuff.

257
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,119
She'll give you the goddamn cab fare!

258
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,949
I don't need this aggravation.
I work for a living.

259
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,036
Theft of services. I know the law.

260
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:36,630
Well, hi!
Excuse me, but do you like candy?

261
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,399
- I got some Sugar Babies.
- No, thank you.

262
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:43,957
I wanted to have a chat. I was very close
to your boyfriend in Atlantic City.

263
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,914
- No, no, no. I'm married.
- No, I don't think so!

264
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,753
Susan!

265
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,110
Did you wear the pretty earrings
he gave you?

266
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:00,789
- Let's have a chat. My car is over there.
- Let go of me!

267
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,593
- Susan!
- Let go!

268
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,031
Susan!

269
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,271
- What happened?
- Are you OK?

270
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,116
My head hurts.

271
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,310
I'm Dez. I'm a friend of Jim's.

272
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,316
Jim?

273
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:39,989
Your boyfriend Jim.
Who was the guy hassling you?

274
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,350
- Guy?
- The guy that just ran off.

275
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,356
- I dunno.
- You don't know?

276
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,713
- I don't remember.
- You don't remember?

277
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,716
Are you OK?

278
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,796
Do you wanna see a doctor?

279
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,995
- I'm OK.
- You're OK.

280
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,876
She's OK. Show's over.

281
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,036
She's with me, she's OK.

282
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,556
Sit down?

283
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,156
Do you remember anything?

284
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,236
I don't know.

285
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,316
How did you get here?

286
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,192
I don't know.

287
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:25,797
Do you remember
what you had for breakfast?

288
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,352
I don't know.

289
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,036
You are Susan, aren't you?

290
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,600
- Susan?
- You don't know.

291
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,516
All right, what do we have here?

292
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,198
No purse?

293
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,278
Do you have anything in your pockets,
maybe?

294
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,396
Is that it?

295
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,315
Now we're getting someplace.

296
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,237
This is my phone number.

297
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,237
Jim must have given it to you.

298
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:03,036
This is like a déjà vu.

299
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,998
How can you have a déjà vu
if you don't remember anything?

300
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,078
No, no. I mean... this is all déjà vu.

301
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,589
This is a Port Authority locker key.

302
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,917
I tell you what. I'm gonna
run you up to the Port Authority.

303
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:22,749
Maybe what's ever in the locker will
help you snap out of it. How's that?

304
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,075
- OK.
- OK.

305
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,396
Let's go.

306
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,917
Wait a minute.

307
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:35,554
This isn't some sort of trick, is it?

308
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:39,719
- What do you mean?
- I mean I know a little bit about you, OK?

309
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:45,073
So don't even consider jerking me around
because I'm not in a great mood today.

310
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,156
Sure, I mean, I wouldn't...

311
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,236
jerk you around.

312
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,316
I don't even know you.

313
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,116
You better wear this.

314
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,273
I hope it's filled with something good.

315
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,116
Look at this!

316
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,150
You sure do move around a lot, huh?

317
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,236
Yeah, I guess.

318
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:07,557
So this stuff does look familiar, right?

319
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,750
Well, it's not completely unfamiliar.

320
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:14,717
You know, when I close my eyes
I see a pyramid.

321
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,990
A pyramid?

322
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,350
Like on your jacket?

323
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,238
Oh, yeah. That must be what it is.

324
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:27,557
At least you got everything.
I hope you're feeling better.

325
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,636
- You are feeling better?
- Yeah.

326
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:33,196
Good. I gotta go.
I gotta get that scooter back.

327
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:36,118
So... I'll see you around
maybe sometime, huh?

328
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,834
Maybe... I'll see you with Jim.

329
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,713
OK? All right, take care! Bye.

330
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,796
Bye.

331
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,759
Susan!

332
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,474
Have you got a place to sleep tonight?

333
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,156
You can sleep at my place.

334
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,236
One night... on the couch.

335
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,316
But I don't want any drama.

336
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,396
I don't want your friends coming over.

337
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:34,071
And I want nothing disappearing
from my apartment. You got that?

338
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,236
Maybe you should quit?

339
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,833
Maybe.

340
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:59,037
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

341
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,356
OK, you. You're outta here.

342
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,196
It's about time.

343
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,755
I don't believe it.

344
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,514
Sorry, man. Have you been waiting?

345
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:12,798
- Never ever again!
- Listen, man, it was an emergency.

346
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,514
I understand. Never ever.
Don't ever ask me again.

347
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,596
- OK.
- Sorry.

348
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,036
This way.

349
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,796
- People live here?
- Yes, people live here!

350
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:36,356
I just thought it was sort of unusual,
that's all.

351
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:40,035
Two flights up.

352
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,196
Oh! Sorry.

353
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,474
Oh! Sorry, man. Excuse me.

354
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,074
Those look exactly like my speakers.

355
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,670
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait a minute.

356
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,109
What do you think you're doing?
Give me that.

357
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,196
Thank you.

358
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,910
What the hell is goin' on here?

359
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,356
I don't believe it.

360
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,791
What you've gotta do is...

361
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:47,229
That's just great, Victoria.

362
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,876
It's my stuff, Dez.

363
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,956
So you just come and take it.

364
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:54,992
No phone call, no discussion,
no nothing.

365
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,395
- How you doin'?
- I'm fine.

366
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:03,716
Listen... I'm gonna take
this stuff down to the Porsche.

367
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:06,229
I believe some of that stuff is mine.

368
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:09,636
Like the answering machine.
Like the Charlie Parker records.

369
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,513
- Oh, you can have it. Here.
- Thank you.

370
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,430
I'll send you a cheque for the rest, OK?

371
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,994
A cheque? Great.

372
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,916
- Hi.
- Hi.

373
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,996
He's really a nice guy.

374
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:32,076
You'll be happy together.

375
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,313
- Sorry.
- It's OK.

376
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:48,676
You know...
you could do a lot with this place.

377
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,756
There's a lot of light.

378
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,996
Ah, shit.

379
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:01,196
It happens, right?

380
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,232
Oh, hi, Dez. It's, uh... It's Jim here.

381
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,430
I'm just calling to see if Susan's OK.

382
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:13,109
I'm calling from...
Oh, shit, I don't know where we are.

383
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,834
It's some motel... Hey, where are we?

384
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:19,077
Anyway, no, look...
I'll call you tomorrow, OK?

385
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,111
And thanks again for everything.

386
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,549
You're a pal. Thanks a lot. OK, bye.

387
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,196
That's gotta ring some bells.

388
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:31,157
- Honestly, no.
- No?

389
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,236
Terrific.

390
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:36,238
- I need a drink. Do you want something?
- All right.

391
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:39,193
Whatever you're having.
Apple juice. Coke. Perrier.

392
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,276
Miller or a Heineken?

393
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,755
- All right.
- Which?

394
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,472
Either one.

395
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,113
Please.

396
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,998
I don't believe it.

397
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,236
She took the refrigerator.

398
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:17,713
- What did the police say?
- Most of these cases turn up in 24 hours.

399
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:21,310
Did you tell them about the jacket?
Her wedding ring in the soap dish?

400
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,192
I told them!

401
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,719
They seem to think she's having an affair.

402
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,400
Oh, my God, maybe she is!

403
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,318
It's ridiculous.
Roberta is not having an affair!

404
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:35,876
- She's much too uptight.
- That is a horrible thing to say.

405
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,913
I suppose you're proud of the way you're
running around with Becky Shuman.

406
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:43,350
I didn't know you knew.
Anyway, we're not running around!

407
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:46,552
We're having
a perfectly respectable affair!

408
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,955
- Gary, let me ask you something.
- What?

409
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:53,392
Does Roberta have orgasms?
I mean, did she have them with you?

410
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:57,113
- Orgasms?
- You have heard of them, haven't you?

411
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:00,152
Maybe she left you
because you weren't satisfying her.

412
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:03,590
Leslie!
Not everybody is obsessed with orgasms!

413
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:06,075
- Some people just... have them.
- Did she?

414
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:10,079
- Did Phil Donahue discuss orgasms?
- You are really a pig!

415
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:13,237
- At least I know about feelings.
- Feelings. I feel! I feel!

416
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:17,148
You're disgusting. You're just like Daddy!
No wonder Roberta left you.

417
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,236
Would you stop saying that!

418
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,316
- Gary...
- Larry!

419
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,000
That looks great.
Any word from Roberta yet?

420
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,758
Fast work, Les.

421
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,836
Oh, let's have some chicken.

422
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,916
The chicken is for tomorrow. Larry!

423
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,871
What did the police say?

424
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,560
I can't believe
you're eating during a crisis!

425
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,033
We're nervous!

426
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,833
Then take a Valium like a normal person!

427
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,796
She has great teeth.

428
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:49,757
That's why I showed up at Battery Park.

429
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:54,878
Jim said a friend of yours got killed
outside your hotel in Atlantic City.

430
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,956
He was pretty worried.

431
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:59,036
Killed?

432
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,957
Dead?

433
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:04,516
Sort of goes with the territory,
doesn't it, Susan?

434
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,836
Maybe I know who did it.

435
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,396
I wish I could remember.

436
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,476
Maybe you were the killer.

437
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,236
No!

438
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:27,193
I should probably lay low for while, huh?

439
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,716
It might be a wise idea.

440
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,273
You don't know
who the guy at the quay was?

441
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,676
Maybe a jilted lover?

442
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,196
I don't think so.

443
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,876
Maybe he was.

444
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:51,756
You know somethin'?

445
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:54,394
You are not at all what I expected.

446
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:58,314
You're not quite what I expected either.

447
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,792
Just how did I meet Jim? I mean, how...

448
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:24,476
How did I meet him?

449
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,556
Maybe it would help.

450
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:29,035
I think it was at some coffee shop.

451
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:32,236
It was your first day at work.

452
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,316
Jim waltzed in.

453
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:37,398
You brought his food over
and you ripped up the check.

454
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:42,191
Is he tall? I mean Jim.

455
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:45,310
He's about medium.

456
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,716
Is he sort of thin?

457
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:52,036
Sort of. Sort of...

458
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,831
...my build.

459
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:00,396
What colour eyes does he have?

460
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,271
Blue.

461
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,356
Like yours?

462
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,871
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

463
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,956
Sorry.

464
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:22,874
I don't know what happened. I just...

465
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,073
Sorry.

466
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:39,996
Come on.

467
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:03,276
Dez!

468
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:13,276
Wanna go out to breakfast with me?

469
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:16,156
Breakfast?

470
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:21,078
What have you got on?
Some sort of disguise?

471
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:24,317
- You don't like it?
- No, it's...

472
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:27,113
...sort of charming.

473
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,072
It's my treat.

474
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,156
What did you do? Rob a bank?

475
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:36,078
I don't know. Maybe.

476
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,557
Where do you wanna go?

477
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,830
See, I found this in the suitcase.

478
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:45,316
Gunny's Coffee Shop? I know the place.

479
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,396
It's over on Center Street.

480
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:50,193
Maybe that's the place where I met Jim.

481
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:52,034
- So?
- So...

482
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:56,392
So we go there
and see if anybody remembers me.

483
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:59,637
So what do you think?
Anyone look familiar?

484
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:03,190
No. Not yet.

485
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:14,319
I found this in the suitcase.
You ever hear of it?

486
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:17,830
The Magic Club? Yeah.
That's that place over on Broadway.

487
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,234
Why?

488
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:21,954
I thought I'd go there
and see if I remember anyone.

489
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:24,674
- You know what you're having?
- Sure.

490
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,756
What are you having?

491
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,836
Well, it's your treat, right?

492
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,871
Yeah, I got money.

493
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,991
I'm gonna have... blueberry blintzes.

494
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:35,076
I'll have that too. That sounds good.

495
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,156
What can I get you?

496
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,555
Yes, I would like a... coffee...

497
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:42,555
and a... doughnut.

498
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:46,753
Miss! When you get a chance,
could you take our order?

499
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,757
You can stay. She's gotta go.

500
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:51,314
Mick, it's that crazy girl with the jacket.

501
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,396
- You, out!
- You know me?

502
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,556
Yeah. You won't get a free meal here.

503
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,911
- I got money, I can pay.
- I don't want your money. Get out.

504
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:01,634
- We got money. What is it?
- Mind your own business.

505
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:04,399
- This is my business, wait a minute!
- Come on, out!

506
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:07,114
- Hey, I'm with her.
- Come on, come on.

507
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:10,835
You're lucky I don't press charges!

508
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,518
Dez.

509
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:15,108
Are you OK? Are you all right? I'm sorry!

510
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:17,231
Rule number one was no drama.

511
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:20,397
- Remember?
- Yes. I know. I'm sorry.

512
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:23,558
Let's get out of here.

513
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,193
I'm sorry.

514
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:43,832
You won't even let me wear my glasses!

515
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:47,236
Go back to selling T-shirts!
You're fired!

516
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:50,397
No, you don't, lan, because I quit!

517
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:54,874
Hey! Not under the ladder!

518
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:01,319
My luck can't get much worse anyway.
Miserable scumbags!

519
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:04,395
Maybe I should've slept with him.

520
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:07,193
Man, some witch steals my clothes,

521
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:11,393
Meeker gets pushed out a hotel window
and now you get fired.

522
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:15,638
No offence, but bad luck really seems
to be following you around.

523
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:21,397
We're both free now.
Let's just go to the movies.

524
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,476
A double feature?

525
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:25,556
Come on!

526
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:30,119
I'll pay for the movie
if you pay for the popcorn.

527
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:31,753
OK, but listen. How much is popcorn?

528
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:33,836
- 2.50
- OK.

529
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,396
This must be the place.

530
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:50,318
Sir, could you pull over, please?
This is it.

531
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:53,756
I'm sorry about what happened.

532
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:56,875
- Are you sure you're not angry?
- Yeah.

533
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:59,636
- Really?
- I'm not angry.

534
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,356
OK. You're a real pal.

535
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:05,676
I'll tell Jim.

536
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:08,271
- Bye!
- Bye.

537
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,156
A real pal. I'll tell Jim...

538
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,830
Bleecker Street Cinema.

539
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:33,915
You just don't fire someone like that!

540
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:36,031
Who am I gonna find
at such short notice?

541
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,116
Come on, Ray. You know lots of girls.

542
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:41,994
- Plenty of women need work.
- Ma! Let me take care of this.

543
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:43,155
Hello.

544
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,077
You saw the sign outside?

545
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,031
Are you looking for a job?

546
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:50,751
Yeah. Yeah, I think I am.

547
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,950
- She thinks she's looking for a job.
- No!

548
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:55,594
I am, I am! What kind of job?

549
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,756
Come on in.

550
00:50:57,880 --> 00:50:59,836
This is Ray.

551
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:01,916
- Hello.
- This is Ray's mom, Gilda.

552
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:03,109
Hi.

553
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:04,798
- This is Henry.
- Hi.

554
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:06,239
Hello, Henry.

555
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:08,316
And I'm lan.

556
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:24,716
Are you OK, Mr Glass?

557
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:27,115
Fine, thank you. Good night, Daisy.

558
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:29,470
I hope you get good news
about Mrs Glass.

559
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:30,555
Thank you.

560
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:33,031
Where did you get this bag?

561
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:35,116
It's mine. Mrs Glass give it to me.

562
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:37,196
Give me the bag, Daisy.

563
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:41,077
- Daisy, give me the bag!
- Sorry, you ain't getting this bag.

564
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:44,237
- Please, I'm asking you nicely.
- You're not getting this.

565
00:51:56,240 --> 00:52:00,313
Hey, guys. Could you...
have your picnic somewhere else?

566
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,116
Hey, guys!

567
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:13,039
Right...

568
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:15,515
Just try to be careful, all right?

569
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:21,837
Listen, I don't get involved
in domestic disputes, OK?

570
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:23,712
There's no dispute.

571
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:26,070
She had the jacket on
when she disappeared.

572
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:29,112
It was very special to her
for some reason.

573
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:31,231
Don't you even remember her?

574
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:33,316
Don't you remember the jacket?

575
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:37,911
It was black and gold and it had
a sort of a pyramid thing on it

576
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:39,712
like on a dollar bill.

577
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:41,796
Vaguely.

578
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:44,957
Great. Thanks.
You've been a terrific help.

579
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:47,071
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

580
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:50,678
She stopped in here
looking for the jacket, too.

581
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,756
Maybe you can help each other.

582
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,916
Susan, will you get the phone?

583
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,991
Susan! The phone's ringing!

584
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,396
Hello?

585
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:17,790
Yeah, hold on. She's right here.

586
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:23,757
- What?
- Another one of your secret admirers.

587
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:25,836
Hello?

588
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:28,276
Yeah. Who is this?

589
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:31,518
Gary Glass?

590
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:40,316
Oh, so you're the witch's husband.
Where's my stuff?

591
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:43,472
Yeah.

592
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:45,712
Yeah.

593
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:47,796
Well, maybe I could help you.

594
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:53,309
Listen, meet me tonight at 10.30
at 30, West 21st Street.

595
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:56,910
I'll be waiting on the third floor
near the bar. You got that?

596
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:59,395
All right, I'll see you there.

597
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:04,476
Hey!

598
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:07,356
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

599
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:10,916
Welcome to the Magic Club.
I'm your host, Big Ray.

600
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:15,716
We have a wonderful line-up for you
this evening, for all you people.

601
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:18,308
You, sir, the man in the red shirt...

602
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:20,829
- Where you from?
- I'm from Brooklyn!

603
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:23,110
Do we have anyone else here
from Brooklyn?

604
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:25,515
Right here.
Why don't you two share a cab home?

605
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:28,799
This is a great audience.

606
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:32,629
OK, let's get on with it.
Introducing, back from his...

607
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:34,716
Susan! Come here!

608
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:37,070
The one, the only, the innovator...

609
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:40,192
From now on, I want you here
five minutes before we begin.

610
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:44,199
Remember, we start with the doves.
You look beautiful. Smile.

611
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:47,118
Davina... Queen of the Night!

612
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:50,073
So let's hear it
from all you lovely people. Come on!

613
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:23,150
Menthol, extra-long, ultra-thin!

614
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:25,794
Extra-ultra long and thin!
Regular, unleaded...

615
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:36,995
Please!

616
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:39,350
Come down!

617
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:57,591
Davina!

618
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:48,276
Bow!

619
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:54,074
This one's worse than the other one!

620
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:57,916
Nice try, kid.

621
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:00,600
Here you go. 20 bucks.

622
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:02,790
See you tomorrow night
at the same time.

623
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:05,195
- You're hiring me?
- Well, of course we are!

624
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:06,355
Thank you!

625
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:09,472
Take these guys home and practise,
all right?

626
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:13,229
And, Susan... practise a lot! OK?

627
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:15,112
- All right.
- Good.

628
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:43,031
Gary Glass, right?

629
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:44,991
Yeah, how did you know?

630
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:47,076
Wild guess.

631
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:52,116
- She split on you, huh?
- Yeah. Two days ago.

632
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:54,196
Has she ever split on you before?

633
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:56,072
No, of course not.

634
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:59,198
- Did she do drugs?
- Drugs? Roberta?

635
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:02,115
She's never smoked a joint
in her whole life.

636
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:05,835
She's probably
the straightest person in Fort Lee.

637
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:07,916
What are you driving at?

638
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:12,309
- Do you want something to drink?
- No, thanks.

639
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:16,149
I'm on this health programme, you know?
No alcohol, no sugar...

640
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:18,271
- Do you wanna dance?
- Dance?

641
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:27,152
Excuse me. Excuse me.

642
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:38,157
Did you read that stuff in the newspaper
about that guy Meeker?

643
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:40,919
He got pushed out of a hotel window
in Atlantic City.

644
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:43,713
- No, why?
- Roberta's mixed up in it.

645
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:45,796
Roberta? That's impossible!

646
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:49,390
Fact. She's trying to frame me
for Meeker's murder.

647
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:51,476
Who's Meeker?

648
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:56,399
Who's Meeker and what does
he have to do with Roberta?

649
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:59,796
Ex-partner and Roberta
were in on it together.

650
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:01,876
l-I think you're mistaken.

651
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,390
Roberta doesn't know anybody
in Atlantic City.

652
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:07,476
I've seen them together!

653
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:10,956
You saw Roberta with another man! Who?

654
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:14,074
Looks like a real greaseball to me.

655
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:17,476
I don't believe a word you're saying.

656
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:19,909
Here, trust me. You wanna find your wife?

657
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:23,237
- Yeah, of course I do!
- Good. Let's go to your place.

658
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:25,316
My place?

659
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:27,677
Excuse me.

660
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:10,873
Excuse me!

661
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,150
Sir!

662
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:15,236
There's someone following me.

663
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:17,916
Please! Could you... Could you...

664
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:20,395
There's a man...
There's a man following me...

665
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:23,432
How do you get in here?
You're not supposed to be in here.

666
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:26,757
I know. I'm sorry, sir,
but could you please see if he's gone?

667
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:29,758
There's a man following me.
Could you see if he's gone?

668
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:31,836
- OK.
- Thank you.

669
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:35,756
You stay here.

670
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:38,440
Enrique will take care of it.

671
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:44,756
Yeah.

672
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:34,556
Sir?

673
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:38,596
Sir!

674
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:54,996
Taxi! Taxi!

675
01:03:56,760 --> 01:03:58,716
Taxi!

676
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:21,318
- You'll get yourself in a twist.
- Wait! I have money!

677
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:23,829
I have money in my bag!
I have money in my bag!

678
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:26,872
OK. The earrings, I need them.

679
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,037
What earrings?
Look, I'm not who you think. Please.

680
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:33,835
All right, all right, avoid the fate
of your late beloved boyfriend.

681
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:52,476
Was he your pimp?

682
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:54,556
What?

683
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:56,636
All right, play it that way.

684
01:04:56,760 --> 01:05:00,719
Come on, you've just got a little bump
on your head. You'll survive it.

685
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:08,756
What's your name?

686
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:10,836
You got a name, don't you?

687
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:14,077
All right, we'll settle this
at the station house.

688
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:17,871
- Roberta.
- Roberta. That's a name.

689
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,956
I'm not who you think I am.

690
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:27,476
How do you use the birds?

691
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:43,636
Nice place you got here, Gar.

692
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:45,716
We like it.

693
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:50,988
Firm.

694
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:53,076
Y-Yeah.

695
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:58,356
They're Roberta's.

696
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:03,030
"How To Be Your Own Best Friend."

697
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:05,636
"I'm OK - You're OK."

698
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:08,476
"Dr Ruth's Guide To Good Sex."

699
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:11,116
Are these Roberta's, too?

700
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:13,470
I didn't know she read this stuff.

701
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:15,556
You know, Gar, between you and me,

702
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:18,513
what do you really know about Roberta?

703
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:20,876
Nice wallpaper.

704
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:39,633
Don't you think
you ought to wait for Roberta

705
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:41,751
before you start taking her clothes?

706
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:43,836
She owes me a coat.

707
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:55,990
- What does she weigh?
- Roberta?

708
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:58,031
105, 110.

709
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:00,549
We're close. Very close.

710
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:06,190
- Nice tub.
- You like it?

711
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:09,630
That's...
It's one of our most popular items.

712
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:14,436
You can install it in any bathroom and it
increases the resale value of your home.

713
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:16,437
I didn't say I wanted to buy one.

714
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:18,516
Right. Sorry.

715
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:23,797
You know, I could get used
to a place like this.

716
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:25,712
Got any pot?

717
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:28,670
Pot...

718
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:30,870
usually I keep some around,

719
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,389
but right now I'm out.

720
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:35,476
You know how it is.

721
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:38,910
How about a match?

722
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:40,996
All right, stop.

723
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:43,152
Face forward.

724
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:45,111
Smile.

725
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:47,196
Turn left.

726
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:50,116
Next.

727
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:52,310
And then you start to think,

728
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:54,396
what's it all about?

729
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:57,915
The big picture, you know what I mean?

730
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:00,516
Sure I do, Gar.

731
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:02,596
I mean, there...

732
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:05,234
There's more to life
than making money, right?

733
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:07,237
I mean, I know that. I mean...

734
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:09,316
Oh...

735
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:15,630
You know... You know how...

736
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:19,036
all time comes from
a single point in the universe?

737
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:22,191
- You know what I mean?
- No.

738
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:33,196
My husband.

739
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:36,511
We live in Fort Lee.

740
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:38,676
There are...

741
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:43,316
things happening in solar systems
so far away

742
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:45,510
that we can't even see them.

743
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:52,030
I mean, what do... what do they care?

744
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:54,879
What do they care
if I am the spa king of New Jersey?

745
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,036
Hello. Glass house.

746
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:01,036
Hello?

747
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:03,836
- Hello?
- Spa king of New Jersey!

748
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:07,756
Spa king!

749
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:14,114
Could I call someone else? Please?

750
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:17,396
Go ahead.

751
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:42,631
All right. You in the pink tutu.

752
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:44,876
Let's go.

753
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:52,196
Nice to have met you.

754
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:56,716
She better have a good explanation!

755
01:09:56,840 --> 01:09:58,876
You haven't seen her and you're yelling.

756
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:03,551
I am not! I am wondering aloud why she
couldn't have called if she was in trouble!

757
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:06,513
Hear her side of it
before you do anything stupid!

758
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:09,313
Mr Glass. Sergeant Taskal. Have a seat.

759
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:11,635
My sister Leslie.

760
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:15,238
She was arrested last night
on the Lower East Side.

761
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:18,796
She's in a holding tank downstairs.
I'll have her brought up.

762
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:22,799
I telephoned you as soon
as I realised the photographs matched up.

763
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:25,115
Hey, Ronnie. Taskal here.
Bring up Glass.

764
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:29,114
We're dropping the charges.
Her husband is here.

765
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:31,834
Well, obviously
he hasn't picked her up yet.

766
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:35,518
Oh, Roberta.

767
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:36,914
Let me see that.

768
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:38,996
Oh, my God.

769
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:44,718
Mr Glass, somebody paid your wife's bail
a little while ago and she was released.

770
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:46,239
You just missed her.

771
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:48,112
Who paid her bail?

772
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:50,356
Boyfriend. Pimp. Who knows?

773
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:52,436
Pimp?

774
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:57,551
I don't know how to thank you, Dez.
I'm really sorry.

775
01:10:57,680 --> 01:10:59,636
Consider it my final favour, Susan.

776
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:02,194
You are really living up
to your reputation.

777
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:04,391
See, now, that's just it, Dez.

778
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:07,034
That's it! I'm not who you think I am.

779
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:09,674
- I don't care who you are.
- No, no, I didn't mean it that way.

780
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:11,916
It's really getting complicated here.
I'm not...

781
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:13,996
Sssh. Stay right there.

782
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:30,039
I don't believe it.

783
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:31,832
God!

784
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:42,433
I don't believe Victoria would do this.

785
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:46,156
Oh, my God.

786
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:49,033
Maybe it was the guy
who grabbed me last night.

787
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:51,116
What?

788
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:53,556
The guy who grabbed you?

789
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:55,751
See, he was after me, Dez.

790
01:11:55,880 --> 01:11:58,440
Well, not me exactly.
He was after Susan,

791
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:00,312
wherever she is, who I'm not!

792
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:02,635
He thinks she's staying here,
which she isn't because I am...

793
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:04,716
I don't wanna hear it!

794
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:07,957
First of all, I get thrown out
on my ass on the sidewalk.

795
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:11,675
Then I have to fork up $200 bail
to get you out of jail.

796
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:16,396
Now I come home and the whole place
is torn apart. Why, I don't know!

797
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:20,748
You know, I really don't need this shit,
Susan. I really don't.

798
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:21,995
Fine.

799
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:24,076
I'll leave.

800
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:36,919
You know, I could have been killed
last night, Dez!

801
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:38,996
I was really scared!

802
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:41,073
Forget it.

803
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:43,156
Sorry about this mess.

804
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:46,679
I can pay you back!
I'll send you a cheque.

805
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:48,756
Great. Another cheque.

806
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:14,032
Sorry.

807
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:16,116
Hey, hey, hey.

808
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:18,674
This mess isn't so bad.

809
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:21,270
I've had worse parties than this.

810
01:14:39,080 --> 01:14:41,548
Richard Nolan and Bruce Meeker
were released

811
01:14:41,680 --> 01:14:44,558
pending appeal of their 1982
conviction for smuggling.

812
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:48,832
They are prime suspects in the
disappearance of the Nefertiti earrings

813
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:52,396
from the Cairo collection
currently on display in New York.

814
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:55,398
Nefertiti? No shit!

815
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:57,988
It's not uncommon!
I've just read an article

816
01:14:58,120 --> 01:15:01,237
about a woman who turned tricks
in the city all morning

817
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:03,749
and shopped all afternoon
before going home.

818
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:06,952
She did it for years
before her husband found out about it.

819
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:11,232
Roberta can't be a prostitute. She doesn't
like sex that much. It's impossible.

820
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:25,474
Oh, my God. I have heard that four
out of five prostitutes are lesbians.

821
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:30,555
Leslie, I think that I would know
if my wife was a lesbian.

822
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:33,114
Why?!
You didn't know she was a prostitute.

823
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:36,195
Gary, I think you have
got to accept the fact

824
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:39,995
that there is something very unusual
going on in your relationship.

825
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:44,395
Who's Susan?

826
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:47,512
Don't get the wrong idea.
She was helping me find Roberta.

827
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:56,998
What are you doing here?

828
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:59,918
I got good news and bad news.
What do you want first?

829
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:02,554
- You said you were going to leave.
- OK, good news.

830
01:16:02,680 --> 01:16:04,671
Your wife isn't with the greaseball.

831
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:08,509
Susan, my wife has just been
picked up on the Lower East Side,

832
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:11,234
escaping from her gun-toting pimp!

833
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:12,270
He's not a pimp.

834
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:14,277
- He's not a pimp.
- Who's not a pimp?

835
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:17,551
The bad news is he'll probably kill her
cos he thinks she's me.

836
01:16:17,680 --> 01:16:19,636
- What?
- Didn't you ever read this?

837
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:21,637
She kept a diary.

838
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:23,990
It's great stuff. "Couldn't sleep."

839
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:27,192
"Went into kitchen.
Gary came in. Turned on light."

840
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:30,118
"Gary left. Finished birthday cake."

841
01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:34,711
Pages of it. It's gotta be a cover.
Nobody's life could be this boring.

842
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:37,229
You shouldn't be reading that. It's private.

843
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:40,636
Yeah, well, it's not about her.
It's about me. Listen to this.

844
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:43,957
"He's looking for Susan again.
She's late returning from Mexico."

845
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:45,957
"This is his fifth ad."

846
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:49,277
"Why does he want to see her so badly?
Who is she?"

847
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:51,550
And there's my picture.

848
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:55,477
Gary, why didn't you tell me
she read the personals?

849
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:57,556
We could've settled this yesterday.

850
01:16:57,680 --> 01:17:00,319
She read them all the time. I didn't think...

851
01:17:00,440 --> 01:17:04,797
Yeah, well, fortunately for everybody,
I'm here and I'm thinking.

852
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:06,876
Give me the car keys.

853
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:11,356
I'll bring it right back.

854
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:12,993
Hiya.

855
01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:16,553
Gary! She is taking the car keys!

856
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:21,313
Shut up, Leslie. OK?

857
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:26,678
Diary. That little sneak,
what did she say about me?

858
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:52,511
"Desperately seeking
stranger seeking Susan."

859
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:56,713
"Regarding key. Meet me Saturday night,
Magic Club, Broadway. 9.30pm. Be there."

860
01:17:56,840 --> 01:17:58,956
- Is that it?
- She'll love it.

861
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:01,036
Pay at the cashier.

862
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:07,832
"Single white male, 40,
looking for afternoon playmates."

863
01:18:07,960 --> 01:18:11,111
Is that it? Pay at the cashier.

864
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:26,992
Dez...

865
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:30,836
I'm not Susan.

866
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:34,878
I'm a housewife
and I live in Fort Lee, New Jersey.

867
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:38,075
I've been married for four years.

868
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:39,792
My husband Gary...

869
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:43,913
He sells bathroom spas and saunas.

870
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:50,996
You never stop, do you?

871
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:53,236
No, really! Really!

872
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:57,797
That's why I like you. I never know
what you'll say next. Come here.

873
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:03,831
Dez.

874
01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:08,396
- What is that?
- I dunno.

875
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:12,596
Someone's trying to get in.

876
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:24,271
Oh, my God.

877
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:26,311
Oh, my God, it's Jim.

878
01:19:26,440 --> 01:19:28,396
Oh, my God.

879
01:19:31,240 --> 01:19:34,630
Jim... Jim. Jim.

880
01:19:35,080 --> 01:19:39,915
Thank God. You had me worried.
How you doing, man?

881
01:19:40,040 --> 01:19:42,793
Somebody jumped me. It was dark.

882
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:45,550
Yeah...

883
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:48,036
It was me.

884
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:51,194
I thought you were somebody else.

885
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:53,276
Who did you think I was?

886
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:58,236
Somebody's been following Susan.
I thought maybe you were him.

887
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:00,237
Who's following her?

888
01:20:00,360 --> 01:20:02,032
I don't know.

889
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:03,878
You know Susan.

890
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:07,310
It's really tough
to get a straight answer out of her.

891
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:11,391
She needs me, Dez.

892
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:13,750
I think maybe she's ready to settle down.

893
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:18,158
Settle down? Susan? Come on, Jim!

894
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:21,238
She'd never do that.
She's really not the type.

895
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:23,271
Since when do you know her so well?

896
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:27,313
Well, I just can't see her settling down.
I mean, she's too wild.

897
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:29,670
But that's what's so great about her.

898
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:31,313
Is that so?

899
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:34,637
I mean, you really seem
to have examined this.

900
01:20:35,320 --> 01:20:38,278
Well, we've been spending
some time together.

901
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:43,839
Just... what are you saying here, Dez?

902
01:20:47,680 --> 01:20:49,830
I'm not gonna bullshit you, Jim.

903
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:52,918
It was a shitty thing to do.
I'm not saying it wasn't.

904
01:20:53,960 --> 01:20:56,633
But you yourself said she was irresistible.

905
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:00,836
Oh, man.

906
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:04,316
Why don't you just hit me again
and, like, finish me off?

907
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:06,396
Look...

908
01:21:06,520 --> 01:21:08,954
Don't cry about it.
I'm really crazy about her

909
01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:10,991
and she's really crazy about me.

910
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:13,350
- I'm sorry.
- Listen. I know Susan.

911
01:21:13,480 --> 01:21:15,596
Whatever she told you doesn't mean shit.

912
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:19,713
She plays with people, Dez. I oughta
know, I've been chasing her for years.

913
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:22,115
I don't think she's playing with me.

914
01:21:22,240 --> 01:21:24,196
Bullshit.

915
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:26,717
All right, Jim.

916
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:28,796
Why don't we just ask her?

917
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:34,915
Su...! You mean she's here?!

918
01:21:37,720 --> 01:21:40,075
Come on out here.

919
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:56,516
She's gone.

920
01:21:58,360 --> 01:22:00,237
She was here.

921
01:22:00,360 --> 01:22:02,316
I swear to God.

922
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:54,156
Dez, are you up there?

923
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:57,112
Yeah?

924
01:22:58,760 --> 01:23:01,718
Guess what, man?
I think she's jerking us both around.

925
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:03,398
What do you mean?

926
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:06,830
Check this out.
I mean, who the hell is this stranger?

927
01:23:22,160 --> 01:23:24,720
Susan, I still don't understand
why we're here.

928
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:27,035
Trust me, Gar.
You're in for a real surprise.

929
01:23:27,160 --> 01:23:29,958
Your surprises are beginning
to make me nervous.

930
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:32,753
- What'd she say?
- We're in for a real surprise.

931
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:35,235
I guess we're not gonna see
Tony Bennett here.

932
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:37,316
I'd settle for a police escort.

933
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:40,159
How could you let her wear
Roberta's jacket?

934
01:23:40,280 --> 01:23:44,239
Hey, she's cold.
She's gotta wear something.

935
01:23:44,360 --> 01:23:46,635
Why don't you
cut your fingernails?

936
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:48,955
I can't hear what you're saying...

937
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:59,148
Dez, if she sees us both here,
she'll probably just split again.

938
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:01,236
You could go home.

939
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:04,193
I wanna see who this fuckin' stranger is.

940
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:14,913
Let me guess. Triple tequila sunrise.

941
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:17,031
Ginger ale.

942
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:21,551
And you're the Scotch.

943
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:23,511
This must be yours.

944
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:25,596
Rum and Tab.

945
01:24:29,960 --> 01:24:32,713
Sit tight. I'm gonna
go look for the stranger.

946
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:35,596
What stranger?

947
01:24:35,720 --> 01:24:38,757
- God, she's gorgeous.
- Beauty fades.

948
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:52,753
There she is.

949
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:56,031
- Where?
- Right there. Talking to the cigarette girl.

950
01:24:56,160 --> 01:24:58,833
That's not Susan.
I never even seen that girl before.

951
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:01,474
Dez, that's Susan.
Don't you think I should know?

952
01:25:02,360 --> 01:25:05,636
That might be a Susan
but that's not my Susan.

953
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:09,196
- That's my Susan.
- Then who was the girl at Battery Park?

954
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:26,511
So who's the stranger?

955
01:25:26,640 --> 01:25:28,631
Jimmy!

956
01:25:28,760 --> 01:25:30,716
Who's the stranger?

957
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:33,229
It's a long story.

958
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:35,396
You wouldn't know her anyway.

959
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:37,476
- Her?
- Yeah. Her.

960
01:25:40,120 --> 01:25:42,680
Come on. We'll talk about it in private.

961
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:49,874
We've got three minutes before curtain!

962
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:51,956
Get your wig on and get out there!

963
01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:01,871
I wonder what happened to Susan.

964
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,150
Looks like you lost your girlfriend.

965
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:06,510
Hey, Larry! I'm married, all right?

966
01:26:06,640 --> 01:26:08,835
- Oh, please!
- What?

967
01:26:15,480 --> 01:26:17,994
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

968
01:26:18,120 --> 01:26:21,271
Welcome to the Magic Club.
I'm your host, Ray...

969
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:25,513
Bartender...
Can I have the check, please?

970
01:26:27,080 --> 01:26:29,833
Hey, is there anyone out here
from... Queens?

971
01:26:29,960 --> 01:26:32,349
You. Well, I'm from
normal parents myself.

972
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:37,992
Anyway, we got a special treat
for you people this evening.

973
01:26:38,120 --> 01:26:40,475
Introducing the one, the only...

974
01:26:40,920 --> 01:26:42,876
Susan, get up here!

975
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:46,151
and his very lovely assistant, Davina...

976
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:49,431
Queen of the Night! So let's hear it!

977
01:26:59,960 --> 01:27:03,032
Gary... Is that...

978
01:27:03,160 --> 01:27:05,549
It can't be.

979
01:27:05,680 --> 01:27:08,399
I'm really enjoying this. It's a great trick.

980
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:21,313
- Roberta?
- I don't believe it.

981
01:27:22,040 --> 01:27:24,713
- Roberta...
- Gary, sit down.

982
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:34,469
I think I'll be staying, thank you.

983
01:27:57,080 --> 01:27:59,878
Cigars? Cigarettes?

984
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,150
She's really got style in a way.

985
01:28:04,280 --> 01:28:06,236
She's good, Gary.

986
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:09,756
Right. Sorry.

987
01:28:50,680 --> 01:28:52,432
Bravo!

988
01:28:57,040 --> 01:28:59,600
That's him. That's the guy.

989
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:03,555
That's the guy!

990
01:29:03,680 --> 01:29:05,398
Hey, help me!

991
01:29:05,960 --> 01:29:08,758
Hey! That's the guy!
That's the guy! Help!

992
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:12,350
Somebody stop that guy! Help!

993
01:29:16,240 --> 01:29:18,276
What... Roberta!

994
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:20,709
- Roberta!
- Who are you?

995
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:24,916
What's going on?

996
01:29:30,160 --> 01:29:32,355
- Did he hurt you? I'll kill him!
- Gary!

997
01:29:32,480 --> 01:29:35,392
- It's OK, I can take care of it now.
- Who is this guy?

998
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:37,476
Who are you?
What do you mean, who am I?

999
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:39,352
- Please...
- Oh.

1000
01:29:41,160 --> 01:29:43,469
Gary... Dez.

1001
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:46,160
Dez, this is Gary, my husband.

1002
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:48,712
Hi.

1003
01:29:48,840 --> 01:29:51,718
- The hot-tub salesman?
- Yeah.

1004
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:54,559
So you were telling me
the truth last night.

1005
01:29:54,680 --> 01:29:56,636
Last night? Oh, no.

1006
01:29:56,760 --> 01:29:58,990
- Did you spend the night with him?
- Gary...

1007
01:29:59,120 --> 01:30:01,873
- Is he the pimp the police mentioned?
- He's not a pimp!

1008
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,956
I'm not a pimp. I'm a friend of hers.

1009
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:06,992
- Somebody tell me what's going on!
- I'm not sure myself.

1010
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:09,076
- I'm having a hard time...
- So am I!

1011
01:30:09,200 --> 01:30:12,636
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
Please, wait a minute, wait a minute.

1012
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:14,113
OK, listen.

1013
01:30:14,240 --> 01:30:18,950
Dez. Dez, I really need to talk
to Gary alone, OK? Please?

1014
01:30:19,960 --> 01:30:21,439
OK.

1015
01:30:21,560 --> 01:30:23,915
I really need some time alone too.

1016
01:30:24,720 --> 01:30:26,676
I'm sorry.

1017
01:30:35,320 --> 01:30:38,790
It's all right. It's all right.
The nightmare's over.

1018
01:30:52,360 --> 01:30:55,397
Don't make a peep.
You're gonna get me outta here.

1019
01:30:57,680 --> 01:30:59,636
Nice legs.

1020
01:31:03,400 --> 01:31:06,312
- I don't understand why you're here.
- Why are you here?

1021
01:31:06,440 --> 01:31:09,113
Wait a minute. Never mind that.
Why did you leave me?

1022
01:31:09,240 --> 01:31:11,071
It was sort of an accident.

1023
01:31:11,200 --> 01:31:13,873
When you were soliciting,
that was an accident, too?

1024
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:15,956
Yes, of course! Gary!

1025
01:31:16,360 --> 01:31:18,555
It all started with the personals.

1026
01:31:18,680 --> 01:31:21,592
There was this ad for Susan.
"Desperately seeking Susan."

1027
01:31:27,880 --> 01:31:29,791
Where did he go?

1028
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:32,480
So they thought
I was a prostitute and arrested me.

1029
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:34,397
Roberta, are you a lesbian?

1030
01:31:34,520 --> 01:31:36,954
Leslie said
lots of prostitutes are lesbians.

1031
01:31:37,080 --> 01:31:40,516
Gary, you're not listening to me.
I'm not a prostitute or a lesbian!

1032
01:31:40,640 --> 01:31:43,871
We'll get professional help.
I don't care how much it costs.

1033
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:47,879
- I just want you to come home with me.
- Why?

1034
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,389
Why? What do you mean, why?

1035
01:31:50,520 --> 01:31:52,511
Why do you want me
to come home with you?

1036
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:54,551
Come on, don't get excited, all right?

1037
01:31:54,680 --> 01:31:56,716
What, are you on drugs
or something now?

1038
01:31:56,840 --> 01:31:58,751
God.

1039
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:00,518
Look at me.

1040
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:03,200
I looked at you. You look ridiculous.

1041
01:32:03,320 --> 01:32:06,790
I mean look at me, Gary.
Look at me.

1042
01:32:14,120 --> 01:32:16,634
I'm not coming home with you.

1043
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:20,115
You're just tired.

1044
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:25,870
Why don't you get changed
and we'll talk about it at home?

1045
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:27,672
Come on. Come on.

1046
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:32,919
Fine. That's fine.

1047
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:37,431
I'm gonna go outside
and I'm gonna wait for five minutes.

1048
01:32:39,200 --> 01:32:41,953
And if you're not there,
I'm gonna leave without you.

1049
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:45,556
Goodbye, Gary.

1050
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:18,916
Hey! Whoa!

1051
01:33:23,680 --> 01:33:25,636
Where did you get this?

1052
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:28,756
Stay!

1053
01:33:34,760 --> 01:33:36,716
Susan, what's going on?

1054
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:45,708
Help me!

1055
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:49,032
Don't push!

1056
01:33:59,200 --> 01:34:01,111
Good goin', stranger.

1057
01:34:01,240 --> 01:34:03,196
Susan.

1058
01:34:13,400 --> 01:34:15,391
Hi.

1059
01:34:15,520 --> 01:34:17,476
What's going on?

1060
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:19,670
My friend, this is the crucial moment.

1061
01:34:20,120 --> 01:34:23,351
Our force field power plant
has been transferred to the ship.

1062
01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:26,592
Our defences are at their weakest,
almost fully automatic.

1063
01:34:26,720 --> 01:34:30,429
The likelihood of a successful
mutant attack is at its strongest.

1064
01:34:30,560 --> 01:34:34,712
- But they may be unaware.
- We've tried to keep them away...

1065
01:34:50,920 --> 01:34:53,593
- Hi.
- Hi.

1066
01:34:57,240 --> 01:34:58,559
How are you doin'?

1067
01:34:59,440 --> 01:35:01,396
OK.

1068
01:35:03,640 --> 01:35:06,234
So I guess your name isn't Susan, huh?

1069
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:09,556
So what is it?

1070
01:35:09,680 --> 01:35:12,513
Roberta.

1071
01:35:17,560 --> 01:35:19,516
That's nice.

1072
01:35:36,040 --> 01:35:38,110
Come on!

1073
