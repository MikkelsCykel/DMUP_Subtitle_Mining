Michael!

2
00:05:28,611 --> 00:05:30,203
<i>Make that change.</i>

3
00:05:47,296 --> 00:05:52,165
<i>On July 7, these five brothers will begin
their summer tour of one-nighters...</i>

4
00:05:52,468 --> 00:05:53,958
<i>in Madison Square Garden.</i>

5
00:05:54,037 --> 00:05:57,006
<i>Yes, I'm The Real Don Steele,
and here's the Jackson 5.</i>

6
00:05:57,073 --> 00:06:00,099
<i>I hope you caught these kids
on The Ed Sullivan Show last night.</i>

7
00:06:00,176 --> 00:06:02,474
<i>From the fact-is-stranger-than-fiction
department:</i>

8
00:06:02,545 --> 00:06:05,105
<i>Michael Jackson
has built a shrine to Elizabeth Taylor...</i>

9
00:06:05,181 --> 00:06:07,046
<i>in the bedroom of his Encino home.</i>

10
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:10,210
<i>Michael Jackson was admitted
with severe burns to his scalp...</i>

11
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:11,378
<i>as far as we know.</i>

12
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:12,614
<i>Michael Jackson.</i>

13
00:06:12,688 --> 00:06:15,555
<i>The Guinness Book of World Records
has listedThriller...</i>

14
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,389
<i>as the biggest-selling album of all time.</i>

15
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:21,726
<i>Michael Jackson has become
the first artist in the history of music...</i>

16
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:24,699
<i>to generate six
number-one singles off one album.</i>

17
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:26,564
<i>The album of course is Bad.</i>

18
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:30,629
<i>What Michael Jackson has achieved
is a tribute to 20 years of hard work...</i>

19
00:06:30,706 --> 00:06:32,799
<i>energy, tireless dedication.</i>

20
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:35,810
<i>Your success
is an American dream come true.</i>

21
00:10:31,981 --> 00:10:35,382
<i>- And the winner is...
- Beat It, Michael Jackson.</i>

22
00:10:35,451 --> 00:10:37,476
<i>Billie Jean, Michael Jackson.</i>

23
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:40,249
<i>Thriller. Quincy Jones
and Michael Jackson.</i>

24
00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:28,896
So what's up?

25
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,070
Who's bad?

26
00:20:48,263 --> 00:20:50,595
So that's the way it goes down?

27
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:27,294
<i>Good afternoon
and welcome to our studio tour.</i>

28
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:31,328
<i>I must ask you that no photos be taken,
and please do not feed the performers.</i>

29
00:21:31,406 --> 00:21:32,566
<i>Thank you.</i>

30
00:21:33,442 --> 00:21:35,967
- Is Bubbles in my trailer?
- Yes, sir.

31
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:37,807
What is he wearing?

32
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:40,746
He's wearing a Prince T-shirt
and red sneakers.

33
00:21:40,816 --> 00:21:41,908
Prince T-shirt?

34
00:21:41,984 --> 00:21:44,612
<i>While on the tour,
please do not startle the performers...</i>

35
00:21:44,686 --> 00:21:47,519
<i>as that jarring
can disturb their breeding habits.</i>

36
00:21:48,023 --> 00:21:49,650
<i>Little studio humor there.</i>

37
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,784
Have you seen
any famous people, Timmy?

38
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:53,623
No, not yet, Grammy.

39
00:21:53,695 --> 00:21:56,721
Can somebody get me
a banana-cream pie after lunch?

40
00:21:56,798 --> 00:21:57,924
What if they're out?

41
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,901
- Can they make me one?
- Consider it done, MJ.

42
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:03,697
- What's with all the smoke?
- Movie stuff, sir.

43
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:11,171
Look, Grammy, it's...

44
00:22:17,352 --> 00:22:21,288
- Mantovani?
- No, Michael Jackson!

45
00:22:41,009 --> 00:22:42,340
Excuse me.

46
00:22:57,559 --> 00:22:59,527
Land of the free.

47
00:23:01,063 --> 00:23:02,758
Home of the weird.

48
00:23:09,504 --> 00:23:11,529
Wonder if they caught him.

49
00:23:11,673 --> 00:23:13,868
- Which way did they go?
- I don't know.

50
00:23:13,942 --> 00:23:16,342
Look, Biff, there he is.

51
00:23:16,611 --> 00:23:19,808
Hey, buddy, how about an autograph?

52
00:23:20,949 --> 00:23:23,213
Would you autograph my tummy?

53
00:23:24,886 --> 00:23:27,320
What's the matter, you got no pen?

54
00:23:29,624 --> 00:23:31,216
Let's get him!

55
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:35,486
Come on, buddy, just one little autograph.

56
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:04,982
Draw, you tin-horned, lily-livered,
side-winding snail!

57
00:24:05,427 --> 00:24:06,451
Cut!

58
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:09,429
You hairball! I'll never finish this movie!

59
00:24:09,631 --> 00:24:12,259
Who let him in? Isn't anybody in charge?

60
00:24:12,334 --> 00:24:14,632
Don't you know anything
about show business?

61
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:15,727
I'm sorry.

62
00:24:15,804 --> 00:24:19,467
My producer is doing this to me, isn't he?
I asked for a bad guy...

63
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:24,001
and he gives me Michael Jackson.
I can't take it anymore! I quit!

64
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:28,379
Peckerwood, you're going to
ruin my career. I'll show you bad.

65
00:24:29,317 --> 00:24:31,478
I'm sorry. I gotta go.

66
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:35,322
Let's get the varmint!

67
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:46,227
I love you, Michael!

68
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:49,268
There he goes!

69
00:24:57,179 --> 00:25:01,240
We'll wait forever to get a shot at this guy.
He's tough to shoot.

70
00:25:04,819 --> 00:25:06,878
Hey, songbird!

71
00:25:06,955 --> 00:25:10,686
- That's him.
- I've had enough of seeing you on my set.

72
00:25:18,033 --> 00:25:19,398
I think he's in there.

73
00:25:19,467 --> 00:25:21,867
Wait a minute, let me get around.

74
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:28,265
I can hear him.

75
00:25:30,378 --> 00:25:31,709
I hear him.

76
00:25:34,583 --> 00:25:36,414
It's awful quiet in there.

77
00:25:36,484 --> 00:25:37,542
He's here.

78
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:40,144
The door's opening. Set your focus.

79
00:25:47,162 --> 00:25:48,595
Stupid rabbit.

80
00:25:48,663 --> 00:25:51,223
- Get out of the way, rabbit!
- Get out of here.

81
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:52,960
He must be hiding.

82
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:04,005
- Look over there.
- Look at that bunny.

83
00:26:05,947 --> 00:26:07,505
Bag that bunny.

84
00:26:13,722 --> 00:26:15,349
It's him!

85
00:29:16,971 --> 00:29:19,997
Pull over, boy, and get your ticket right.

86
00:31:40,615 --> 00:31:43,209
Me and my friend Spike, we were just...

87
00:31:43,851 --> 00:31:45,284
My friend, he was just...

88
00:31:45,353 --> 00:31:49,585
- Spike. He was just here...
- I need your autograph right here.

89
00:37:24,925 --> 00:37:27,723
- Hi, David!
- Hi, Mary Beth!

90
00:37:27,795 --> 00:37:28,955
Hi, neighbor!

91
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,671
What are you stopping for?

92
00:37:44,745 --> 00:37:47,680
- That star over there.
- So what? Keep moving.

93
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:50,609
Maybe that's his lucky star.

94
00:37:50,985 --> 00:37:54,580
- He needs one.
- Quit worrying, Katie. Come on.

95
00:37:55,156 --> 00:37:56,623
What a pal.

96
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:01,257
Hey, Zeke, over here.

97
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:04,991
Hey, let me see.

98
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:52,470
- Let's get out of here!
- Katie, come on!

99
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:19,462
Katie, come on.

100
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:32,712
It's about time you threw it to me.

101
00:39:49,503 --> 00:39:51,835
Skipper, come back here.

102
00:39:55,075 --> 00:39:57,202
Katie, let's go. Come on.

103
00:40:00,547 --> 00:40:02,276
Hurry up. Come on.

104
00:40:04,285 --> 00:40:07,777
- Michael, where'd he go?
- He went in the woods over here.

105
00:40:48,862 --> 00:40:51,956
Oh, my God! Look at this.

106
00:41:05,412 --> 00:41:06,936
I don't like spiders.

107
00:41:07,848 --> 00:41:09,372
Wait a minute.

108
00:41:19,193 --> 00:41:20,922
No, Michael.

109
00:41:25,866 --> 00:41:27,561
Katie, it's okay.

110
00:42:12,913 --> 00:42:15,006
You got to be real quiet.

111
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:26,153
Okay, let's see.

112
00:42:26,226 --> 00:42:27,454
Real quiet, okay?

113
00:42:27,594 --> 00:42:29,562
Europe, Asia...

114
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:34,726
Miami, New York. Cocaine, crack.

115
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:37,600
San Francisco...

116
00:42:38,238 --> 00:42:39,899
heroin and speed.

117
00:42:46,747 --> 00:42:49,011
You guys gotta hit the middle
of this country.

118
00:42:49,082 --> 00:42:51,380
Get in the middle of the country.

119
00:42:51,452 --> 00:42:53,181
Stop those kids from praying in school.

120
00:42:53,253 --> 00:42:56,586
First, I want you to hang around
by playgrounds, school yards.

121
00:42:57,324 --> 00:42:59,485
You got to remember,
a younger customer...

122
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:02,358
always turns into a loyal customer.
Remember that!

123
00:43:03,397 --> 00:43:04,989
He can't be doing that.

124
00:43:05,065 --> 00:43:08,125
Every kid in school
will have to take drugs because of me.

125
00:43:08,202 --> 00:43:10,602
I want everybody to know. Everybody.

126
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:14,937
My name is gonna be in history books.
They better spell my name right.

127
00:43:15,275 --> 00:43:18,676
L- I-D-E-O. So simple.

128
00:43:19,546 --> 00:43:22,982
Frankie Lideo. Very easy.

129
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:25,650
Bugs and drugs.

130
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:30,317
Smooth operation, that's what I got.

131
00:43:31,892 --> 00:43:32,984
What?

132
00:43:42,269 --> 00:43:43,668
Up there!

133
00:44:30,183 --> 00:44:33,209
That was good. That was just great.

134
00:44:35,722 --> 00:44:38,384
Okay, let's sweep him up now. Come on.

135
00:44:40,894 --> 00:44:42,521
Where is he?

136
00:44:48,101 --> 00:44:49,898
There! Come on, get him!

137
00:44:49,970 --> 00:44:52,495
Kill him! Move!

138
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,635
Let's see how cool he is now!

139
00:45:05,085 --> 00:45:07,781
Now, let's go! Move it!

140
00:45:09,756 --> 00:45:12,953
Split up. Spread out, boys!

141
00:45:14,528 --> 00:45:17,463
Come on. Hurry up.

142
00:45:51,298 --> 00:45:52,925
Cover everything!

143
00:45:55,736 --> 00:45:59,001
I want reports. I'm not
hearing anything back to me.

144
00:46:07,114 --> 00:46:09,480
Block off the streets. Block them off.

145
00:46:09,549 --> 00:46:12,848
Double back. Keep moving around,
you'll trap him that way.

146
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:22,192
Come on, move it, I'm not
hearing any reports back here!

147
00:46:28,402 --> 00:46:30,529
Split up! Get your men all over!

148
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:43,448
Block off tunnels, he's a rat.

149
00:46:51,825 --> 00:46:53,884
Shoot anything that moves!

150
00:46:56,697 --> 00:47:00,531
What's that? Did you get him?
I heard gunfire. Did you get him?

151
00:48:04,397 --> 00:48:08,356
He's gotta be somewhere around here.
He's gotta be here, he didn't get out.

152
00:48:09,202 --> 00:48:10,760
Move! Move it!

153
00:48:12,773 --> 00:48:15,071
Cover that side. All right!

154
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:16,769
Bring in the artillery!

155
00:48:16,843 --> 00:48:20,836
I want everybody in this squad.
Pull out all the new hardware on him.

156
00:48:21,615 --> 00:48:23,879
I want this one messy.

157
00:48:24,251 --> 00:48:26,685
Turn him into a stain on the concrete!

158
00:48:27,087 --> 00:48:30,648
Look for that little cockroach, too.
She's around here somewhere.

159
00:48:56,550 --> 00:48:57,983
Give me that.

160
00:49:15,101 --> 00:49:16,966
There he is. Hold it.

161
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:22,435
He's not going anywhere.

162
00:49:27,147 --> 00:49:30,139
Now there's no way out of there,
don't screw it up.

163
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:43,127
Come on, let's go!

164
00:49:56,743 --> 00:49:57,971
All right, come on!

165
00:49:58,044 --> 00:50:00,569
What are you waiting for?
It's only one guy.

166
00:50:16,596 --> 00:50:19,394
All right, come on.
It's a car, that's all it is.

167
00:50:21,835 --> 00:50:23,564
What are you waiting for?

168
00:50:23,970 --> 00:50:24,959
Fire!

169
00:50:36,483 --> 00:50:39,543
What's that? Who was that? What is it?

170
00:50:40,921 --> 00:50:43,412
Get him! Go get him!

171
00:50:47,494 --> 00:50:49,462
Get him. Come on, get him!

172
00:51:09,783 --> 00:51:12,274
- Michael?
- Katie, are you okay?

173
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:15,479
- Michael got away.
- No way.

174
00:51:15,555 --> 00:51:17,614
He told us to meet him here, right?

175
00:51:17,691 --> 00:51:18,680
Yeah.

176
00:51:19,459 --> 00:51:20,585
This place?

177
00:51:36,109 --> 00:51:38,339
Nobody's been here for years.

178
00:51:38,745 --> 00:51:40,508
It's kind of spooky.

179
00:51:53,126 --> 00:51:55,822
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

180
00:52:25,358 --> 00:52:27,758
I think maybe
we came to the wrong place.

181
00:52:31,598 --> 00:52:33,065
It says Club 30's.

182
00:52:34,167 --> 00:52:36,294
Hey, you guys, something's coming.

183
00:52:41,508 --> 00:52:43,601
- You scare everybody!
- Shut up.

184
00:52:55,155 --> 00:52:58,181
- So, what'd you see?
- Come on. This isn't good.

185
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:01,227
Hello, is anybody there? Hello?

186
00:53:01,528 --> 00:53:04,395
Man, are you okay? Come on.
Tell us what you saw.

187
00:53:04,497 --> 00:53:06,590
- Michael.
- So?

188
01:01:15,454 --> 01:01:16,614
That's cool.

189
01:01:17,056 --> 01:01:20,457
- I taught him everything he knows.
- Oh, yeah, right, you show me.

190
01:01:20,526 --> 01:01:22,824
Okay, sure. Hold this.

191
01:03:05,631 --> 01:03:06,825
Come on!

192
01:03:06,899 --> 01:03:08,264
Give me that.

193
01:03:11,370 --> 01:03:14,737
They got Katie, man.
They grabbed and took her away.

194
01:03:14,807 --> 01:03:18,038
- I was in there! I was right in there.
- Lf we move too quick...

195
01:03:18,110 --> 01:03:20,476
- Which way did they go?
- They went over here.

196
01:03:20,546 --> 01:03:22,844
- Look!
- Don't touch it!

197
01:03:22,915 --> 01:03:24,109
Oh, no.

198
01:03:24,884 --> 01:03:27,785
- Michael, you gotta help her.
- What can he do?

199
01:03:28,020 --> 01:03:30,079
You'll see what I can do.

200
01:03:34,126 --> 01:03:35,491
You'll see.

201
01:03:43,602 --> 01:03:45,797
Stay back.

202
01:03:47,506 --> 01:03:49,337
Is anybody up there?

203
01:03:54,747 --> 01:03:56,374
Watch your step.

204
01:04:06,292 --> 01:04:07,281
Peanuts?

205
01:04:12,298 --> 01:04:13,458
Over here.

206
01:04:13,532 --> 01:04:15,261
How are we gonna get to him?

207
01:05:15,494 --> 01:05:16,961
What are you doing?

208
01:05:17,363 --> 01:05:20,059
I'm trying to get a lucky star for Michael.

209
01:05:20,533 --> 01:05:22,797
Why don't we go get the cops instead?

210
01:05:32,444 --> 01:05:34,207
- No!
- Shut up! Shut it!

211
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:36,939
- Michael, help.
- Shut up.

212
01:05:40,119 --> 01:05:42,383
Stop crying. Get over here.

213
01:05:44,523 --> 01:05:46,548
- Let her go.
- Shut up.

214
01:05:46,826 --> 01:05:49,590
Don't you talk to me! You shut up!

215
01:05:49,929 --> 01:05:51,658
Why are you doing this? Stop it!

216
01:05:51,730 --> 01:05:54,790
You wanna know why
I'm doing this to you? You be quiet!

217
01:05:56,135 --> 01:06:00,162
I just wanna get everybody high, man.
You know, some good drugs.

218
01:06:01,073 --> 01:06:03,337
- After all...
- Do it and you're dead.

219
01:06:05,311 --> 01:06:07,245
Let's give her a shot of this.

220
01:06:07,913 --> 01:06:09,574
Listen, man...

221
01:06:09,915 --> 01:06:11,348
No!

222
01:06:18,490 --> 01:06:19,514
Get up!

223
01:06:20,092 --> 01:06:22,117
This isn't so smooth now, is it?

224
01:06:23,629 --> 01:06:25,654
Now, get out of here.

225
01:06:25,731 --> 01:06:28,894
Where you going, brat? Little cockroach.

226
01:06:31,570 --> 01:06:32,798
Kill her first!

227
01:06:34,006 --> 01:06:36,338
- Shut up!
- Leave her alone!

228
01:07:58,724 --> 01:07:59,850
Amazing.

229
01:08:15,007 --> 01:08:16,065
Fire!

230
01:08:36,528 --> 01:08:37,620
Fire!

231
01:09:18,837 --> 01:09:20,737
Bring on everything!

232
01:09:24,777 --> 01:09:26,142
You men, get him!

233
01:11:55,661 --> 01:11:56,650
Oh, no!

234
01:12:03,969 --> 01:12:07,336
Where are you, you tin-headed creep?
Where are you?

235
01:12:09,308 --> 01:12:10,832
Hold it, I got you.

236
01:12:17,015 --> 01:12:19,279
Stay there, I have something for you.

237
01:12:22,521 --> 01:12:23,510
Gotcha!

238
01:12:33,432 --> 01:12:34,626
Oh, no!

239
01:12:37,135 --> 01:12:39,660
I got you, tin-head.

240
01:12:41,673 --> 01:12:44,107
Okay, where's that cockroach brat?

241
01:12:50,949 --> 01:12:52,849
Okay, kiddies, I've got you.

242
01:12:53,252 --> 01:12:55,914
Who's it now? Who is it?

243
01:14:17,602 --> 01:14:20,230
- Where's he going?
- He's leaving.

244
01:14:22,007 --> 01:14:23,372
Goodbye, Michael.

245
01:14:30,382 --> 01:14:32,179
Thank you, Michael.

246
01:14:33,719 --> 01:14:34,845
Bye.

247
01:15:00,579 --> 01:15:02,843
Feels weird without him, huh?

248
01:15:07,152 --> 01:15:08,915
He saved our lives.

249
01:15:13,091 --> 01:15:14,786
I'm gonna miss him.

250
01:15:18,663 --> 01:15:19,925
Me, too.

251
01:15:30,409 --> 01:15:33,378
I made this star
to remember Michael with.

252
01:15:34,279 --> 01:15:35,871
His lucky star.

253
01:15:37,516 --> 01:15:38,710
Yeah.

254
01:15:39,551 --> 01:15:41,985
It's is not his lucky star. It's gone.

255
01:15:51,163 --> 01:15:53,597
Not your lucky star, it's not.

256
01:16:04,976 --> 01:16:06,739
I wish he would come back.

257
01:16:40,145 --> 01:16:41,407
You're back!

258
01:16:41,780 --> 01:16:43,680
You came back.

259
01:16:54,493 --> 01:16:56,586
You're back. You came back.

260
01:16:58,797 --> 01:17:00,662
I'm so happy to see you.

261
01:17:02,434 --> 01:17:04,425
You know I had to come back, Sean.

262
01:17:05,737 --> 01:17:07,295
Come on, let's go.

263
01:17:07,606 --> 01:17:09,073
This is so exciting.

264
01:17:09,708 --> 01:17:11,608
We're going back to the club?

265
01:17:11,776 --> 01:17:15,872
- What's gonna be in here this time?
- You'll see, Zeke. You'll like this.

266
01:17:17,182 --> 01:17:18,945
Everybody get ready.

267
01:17:19,751 --> 01:17:21,480
- Ready?
- Yeah.

268
01:17:33,865 --> 01:17:35,492
Where are we going?

269
01:17:35,734 --> 01:17:38,703
- Stay together, you'll see.
- What's all this stuff?

270
01:17:39,304 --> 01:17:42,137
Don't worry, I'm gonna show you
something special.

271
01:17:42,674 --> 01:17:44,039
Keep going.

272
01:17:45,844 --> 01:17:47,334
What's that?

273
01:17:47,546 --> 01:17:51,038
- I think I heard something.
- You didn't hear anything.

274
01:17:52,417 --> 01:17:55,875
- You know something you're not telling.
- It's a surprise.

275
01:17:56,955 --> 01:17:59,788
- Are there spiders?
- There are no spiders in here.

276
01:17:59,958 --> 01:18:03,257
- I wanna see some rats.
- There are no rats in here.

277
01:18:04,996 --> 01:18:08,329
- What's down there?
- Nothing. We're going ahead.

278
01:18:12,270 --> 01:18:13,931
It's just a plug.

279
01:18:15,574 --> 01:18:17,565
Yeah, you jumped back, too.

280
01:18:17,642 --> 01:18:19,337
Go around this way.

281
01:18:23,748 --> 01:18:26,148
Mike, where've you been?
We have one minute.

282
01:18:26,217 --> 01:18:27,878
Let's go.

283
01:18:28,687 --> 01:18:31,315
Hey, kids, I think I found
a friend of yours.

284
01:18:34,693 --> 01:18:36,320
Hey, Skipper.

285
01:18:38,797 --> 01:18:41,231
- Come on with me.
- Come on, Skipper.

286
01:18:46,304 --> 01:18:47,999
Where have you been, MJ?

287
