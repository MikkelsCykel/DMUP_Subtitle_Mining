Did you ever wonder
what your purpose in life is?

377
00:28:15,458 --> 00:28:19,019
This book is about finding
your soul's purpose or destiny.

378
00:28:19,128 --> 00:28:22,894
Every soul has its path,
but sometimes that path is not clear.

379
00:28:22,999 --> 00:28:27,698
The Inner Map Theory
is an example ofhow each soul
begins with an imprint,

380
00:28:27,803 --> 00:28:31,239
all compacted into a pattern
that has been selected by your soul...

384
00:28:43,953 --> 00:28:48,652
is because I really feel
close to, um, Buddhism.

I really feel...
I really believe in reincarnation.
