(EIvis Presley)
#Are you Ionesome tonight?

2
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,309
# Do you miss me tonight?

3
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:12,719
#Are you sorry we drifted apart?

4
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,118
# Does your memory stray

5
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:23,474
# To a bright summer day

6
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:29,434
#When I kissed you
and called you sweetheart?

7
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,989
(whispers) Miss Bird...

8
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,991
...said...

9
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,751
...brightly.

10
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,394
(birds twittering)

11
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,435
(twittering reverberates)

12
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,033
(doctor)
Does that make you feel funny, son?

13
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,277
You don't feel woozy?
Like you might faint?

14
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,550
- No, sir.
- Good.

15
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,274
I know it's writin', Thad.

16
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:14,389
This all started just about the same time
you started with your stories.

17
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,433
- Sittin' in the dark, squintin' to see.
- (doctor) Hm.

18
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,793
Couldn't that be it, Doctor? Couldn't
all this come from strainin' his eyes?

19
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,391
Possibly. But these sounds,
these bird sounds he's hearing.

20
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:31,435
Sometimes a smell or a sound can be
a sign of something more than eyestrain.

21
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,229
I don't think we have an emergency,
but we'll have to watch it, Thad.

22
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,590
- Wanna be a writer, do ya?
- Yes, sir.

23
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,678
If he's so determined,
you oughta buy the man a typewriter.

24
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,149
We have our eye on a used one.

25
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,311
Been savin' up for it.

26
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,513
Maybe we ought to go ahead
and buy it, huh, Thad?

27
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,238
Seven-thirty, Thad. You'll miss your bus.

28
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,950
Let's go, hotshot.

29
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,711
Thaddeus.

30
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,238
My Lord. All this in one mornin'?

31
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,596
(whispers) Thaddeus!

32
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,315
Polly! There's something
wrong with Thad Beaumont.

33
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,194
Stay in your seats. Stay in your seats.

34
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,235
Thad? What's wrong, honey?

35
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:55,438
Three-by-five-centimetre window in
the upper-left anterior portion of the skull.

36
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,353
- (nurse) BP is steady at 120 over 80.
- I'm opening.

37
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,552
- Oh, my.
- (anaesthetist) Slight fluctuation.

38
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,672
Hilary! Remember where you are, please.

39
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,238
(nurse) Respiration normal at 65.

40
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,396
(screams)

41
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,349
- Get someone in here.
- What in the world is it?

42
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,433
It's nothing. Once it was a twin.

43
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,989
- Now it's nothing.
- A twin?

44
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,634
Unborn, but absorbed into the system.

45
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,792
We'll continue with 18 units of valium,
packed cells.

46
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,389
We have an eye...

47
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,075
...part of a nostril...

48
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,952
...two teeth.

49
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,674
Hm. One of the teeth has a small cavity.

50
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,517
A year ago this was probably
submicroscopic in size.

51
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:49,397
Somehow it... got itself going again.
The damn thing actually started to grow.

52
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,074
- Incredible.
- Don't ask me why.

53
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,232
All I know is that we've located
a very rare sort of... tumour.

54
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,873
Close call, folks,
but I think we got here just in time.

55
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,952
I'm getting
a slight elevation in blood pressure.

56
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,829
What the hell...?

57
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,957
Beautiful in Atlanta, no delays. Dallas,
Fort Worth, experiencing thunderstorms.

58
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,073
Watch out for serious weather in this
area. Could be some tornado activity.

59
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:06,478
Strong thunderstorms back through
the central Rockies as well.

60
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,189
Honey, can I... Can Mommy have that?
Thank you very much.

61
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,919
William. Don't... don't do that, buddy.

62
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,753
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- A born editor.

63
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,869
- It's not that bad, is it?
- (William gurgles)

64
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,231
Guess it is. Just a sec.
I got something for you.

65
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,310
I act like a pure klutz.

66
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,515
There. Play with these things.

67
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:58,638
- What do you think, Mommy?
- Sh. Just a minute. I'm on the last page.

68
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,515
- Not much?
- Not much?

69
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,869
- It's wonderful.
- There's not a lot there.

70
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,275
I stay up all night
and produce nine lousy pages.

71
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:20,598
- Nine perfect pages. It's great.
- But is it a best seller?

72
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,553
Who cares?
It's gonna be a great book, Thad.

73
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:27,309
You're doing it.
You are actually really doing it.

74
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,279
Oh...

75
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,671
It's not comin' outta me easy.

76
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,513
(Thad) We are human beings. Plural.

77
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,756
Each one of us is two separate beings.

78
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:49,350
There's the outer being,
the one we show to the world at large.

79
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,750
Inhibited, timid...

80
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,828
- Often a pathological liar.
- (laughter)

81
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,515
And then there's the inner being.

82
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,190
The truthful one.

83
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:05,355
Passionate, uninhibited, even lustful.

84
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:10,799
And most of us keep that inner being
hidden away, locked up.

85
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:16,275
But the fiction writer doesn't have to hide
it, doesn't have to keep it from anything.

86
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,278
He can let it out,
bring it out in the open, let it live.

87
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,910
Hell, he can give it the car keys, let it ride!

88
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,230
Yes!

89
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:28,197
In fact, he has to do that.

90
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:34,268
It's essential. The writer has to let
that inner being out of the lockup.

91
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,991
He has to let it have a voice in his work
otherwise the work itself will be inhibited.

92
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,350
Timid. Without passion.

93
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,909
It'll be a pack of lies.

94
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,352
I think we'll cut it short today.
I was up all night working.

95
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,433
- That inner being kept me awake. I...
- (laughter)

96
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,230
Your stories are due on Wednesday.
Don't forget.

97
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:30,038
Uh, w...
would you autograph your book for me?

98
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,752
Just make it out to Fred. Fred Clawson.

99
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,154
- That's not my book.
- Isn't it?

100
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,151
No. Look here.

101
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,311
Hm?

102
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,716
The picture's a phoney.

103
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,350
The name too. "George Stark."

104
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,192
Phoney.

105
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,470
I know all about it.

106
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,719
(Clawson)
It's my turn to be storyteller, OK?

107
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:00,151
There's this writer, see?
Let's call him "Beaumont".

108
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,552
He writes a coupla highbrow books
about yuppies and faggots.

109
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,433
The critics rave but nobody buys,
so he changes his style.

110
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,636
He starts writing
about tits and tough guys.

111
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,354
- He dreams up this badass character.
- Machine.

112
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,511
- Yeah.
- Alexis Machine.

113
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:22,438
He calls himself George Stark, so his
mother won't find out he writes this shit.

114
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:28,718
He slaps a phoney picture on the back,
boom! He sells a million copies.

115
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,469
So he writes three more of these things.
Boom, boom, boom. He gets rich.

116
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:37,037
- Not that rich.
- Rich enough, I think. Rich enough.

117
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,708
So, what's he gonna write next?

118
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,276
A nice big cheque, if he wants me
to keep my mouth shut about this.

119
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,789
And if he doesn't want?

120
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,913
- What if he doesn't care what you do?
- Oh, he wants. He cares.

121
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,230
And if he doesn't,
the people around him do.

122
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,317
They got a major-league scam goin' here.

123
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:01,230
There's a million Americans out there just
waiting to lay out their 29 and change...

124
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,271
...for George to give 'em another hard-on.

125
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:08,156
They believe in George Stark. They
believe he's writin' about shit he knows.

126
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,438
They find out they've been lied to, that 29
and change might go back in the pocket.

127
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,798
And I don't think you or the people
around you wanna take that chance.

128
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,551
- How'd you find out?
- This babe who works for your publisher.

129
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,799
I live in New York. She gave me the whole
story. It's like Machine says in your book.

130
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,152
"At nine o'clock, she came.
At ten o'clock, she came across."

131
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:39,038
I've written about slime before, Clawson,
but none of it as low to the ground as you.

132
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,357
- Maybe you'll put me in a book someday.
- Oh, I will.

133
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,028
And I'll make you suffer.

134
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,435
Before you die.

135
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,677
Uh, look,
I got a bus to catch back to New York.

136
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,751
You think about it.

137
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,951
- "To Fred"?
- Huh?

138
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,237
Oh, yeah.

139
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:11,958
Look, you talk to your people, see what
it's worth to keep this outta the papers.

140
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:18,516
I'll call you in a few days, and
we can negotiate the, uh, payment plan.

141
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,359
Oh, and thanks for the autograph.

142
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:28,956
(wife) Don't go crazy over this.
We'll figure out a way to handle it.

143
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:32,277
Oh, it's just such an invasion.
Who needs this shit?

144
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,873
- (metallic thud)
- (babies cry)

145
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,951
Oh...

146
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,830
OK, come on. You're gonna help me.
They're both up.

147
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,677
Who's the best boy? Who's the best boy?

148
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,550
Who's all wet? Whoo-oo.

149
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,669
OK. OK.

150
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,396
There you go.

151
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,109
OK, just a minute, swirly-whirly.

152
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,038
I know how you could blow this guy off,
really knock him for a loop.

153
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,708
- I'd like to knock him for a loop.
- (baby gurgles)

154
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:14,959
Little stinker.
That dirty little stinker. That little rat.

155
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,754
I oughta go get him.
That's what Alexis Machine would do.

156
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:21,157
He'd cut off his pecker
and shove it in his little rat mouth...

157
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,756
...so when they found him,
they'd know he was a squealer.

158
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:36,949
- How can I knock him for a loop?
- Go to the press yourself.

159
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,355
Tell them "I'm George Stark."

160
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,636
OK, come on.

161
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,316
Eat hearty. If I do this crazy thing
your mother's talkin' about...

162
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,397
...we'll end up livin' on cat food.

163
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:00,515
I think Thad Beaumont can sell enough
books to keep his family off the streets.

164
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:07,110
What do you guys think, huh? Is it
time to say "Bye-bye, Uncle George?"

165
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,837
Yeah. Hm.

166
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,315
Well, I guess it's unanimous.

167
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,314
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

168
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,991
Oh, no.

169
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,550
- Shit!
- That's all right.

170
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:37,276
- I think I cooked it a little too long.
- No, it'II... it'll be good.

171
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,352
(she laughs)

172
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:45,796
So that's the story, Rick. It seems like
going public is the right thing to do.

173
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:51,194
I just need to know you're all right with it.
Stark earns a lot more for you than I do.

174
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:55,996
Well, hey, if you don't want me to do
this, I'll give it some more thought.

175
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,357
Yeah.

176
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,790
Yeah... No, absolutely.

177
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,911
Oh, yeah, sure we have.

178
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:12,071
- Miriam? What, is she there?
- (whispers) Are you kidding?

179
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,191
You guys patching things up?

180
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,710
No such thing. We're committed
to making our divorce work.

181
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,390
But she still is my business partner.
She's picking up the extension.

182
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:26,276
Thad, your new book is gonna
win awards and sell 200,000 hardback.

183
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,035
Who needs George Stark?
We'll help you get rid of him.

184
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:34,189
I'll put out a press release, you can
do the talk shows. I say hallelujah.

185
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,960
You heard the lady, Thad.
We're with you 100o/, baby.

186
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,469
Bye, Thad. Kiss the babies for me.

187
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,035
- Bye-bye.
- Talk to you soon.

188
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:47,277
- Shit.
- He shouldn't be writing trash.

189
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,989
We have a lot of clients
who can make us money with trash.

190
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,829
I like trash. I love trash.
I read George Stark cos it's fun.

191
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,349
I read Thad Beaumont
because it's my job.

192
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,030
That's why we now live
across town from each other.

193
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,949
Let's get back to work.

194
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:13,189
(Rick) So we kill off George Stark.
OK, that's OK. We kill off Stark.

195
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,676
Hey, maybe Beaumont's books
start to sell. Who knows?

196
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:21,231
Stranger things have happened.
Stranger things have happened.

197
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,800
- You're not sold on this?
- It's the money, Liz.

198
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,072
We're used to a pretty nice life.
Flushing that away just...

199
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:35,398
Be honest, Thad. You don't wanna give up
George. You've become attached to him.

200
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:40,310
Yeah, well, I mean, is that so weird? I've
been working with the guy for a long time.

201
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,353
I'm used to him. I like having him around.

202
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,719
Sure. He lets you do what you want, say
anything you want, be anything you want.

203
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,275
He's your drinking buddy.

204
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,555
Liz, I'm not an alcoholic. Hm?

205
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,396
- George Stark is.
- Oh, come on.

206
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,877
You don't realise what you're like
when you write those books, do you?

207
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:04,392
- It's like watching Jekyll turn into Hyde.
- That's a little extreme.

208
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,908
I'm not out raping barmaids.

209
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:10,596
Thad Beaumont gave up drinking.
He gave up smoking. George Stark didn't.

210
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,712
And these god-awful moods you get in...

211
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,390
You say these really
mean things sometimes.

212
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,395
Look, I am who I am, Liz.
It's all me. It's all part of me.

213
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,310
Even the ugliness is a part of me.

214
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,192
"Machine turned the razor down
and slashed the strop in two."

215
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,949
"A long section fell to the floor
like a severed tongue."

216
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,429
"'Cut him' Jack Rainsley said eagerly.
'Cut him while I stand and watch."'

217
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,750
"'I wanna see the blood flow."'

218
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,431
"Halstead squeezed his eyes shut, but the
razor slid effortlessly through the lid...

219
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,673
...and punctured the eyeball beneath
with a faint popping sound."

220
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,752
"'I'm back' Machine said.
'I'm back from the dead...

221
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:58,317
...and you don't seem glad to see me at all,
you ungrateful son of a bitch."'

222
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:03,629
Yeah, well. I hope you're not looking for
any social significance, Mr Donaldson...

223
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,394
...because there ain't none to be found.

224
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,109
You're the New Yorker.
I can tell by the hair.

225
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,995
Mike Donaldson, People Magazine.
You're, uh... the photographer?

226
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,954
Yes, sir. Homer Gamache.
I'm gonna do this up brown for you.

227
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,435
And you're Thad Beaumont.

228
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:40,355
Seen you around town. Whoever'd
have thought you was a celebrity?

229
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:44,997
- I'm not the celebrity. George Stark is.
- Well, we're here to change that.

230
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,159
Come on, you guys. Let's go.
Thad, will you grab my purse, please?

231
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,436
- Yeah.
- OK. All right.

232
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,830
All right, I got the diaper bag.

233
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,275
- You've got a terrific getaway.
- Thank you.

234
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,829
- (doorbell)
- Oh, excuse me.

235
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:09,749
We can never get up here. When Thad's
teaching, we have to stay in the city.

236
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,315
Trudy, thanks for coming over.

237
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,274
- Did they take pictures of the little ones?
- No.

238
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,592
Good. Kidnappers around, you know.

239
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,439
They might see a picture,
it might give 'em some ideas.

240
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,750
They're not gonna take
pictures of the kids.

241
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:27,350
Not while I'm around they won't.
These men make a mess, don't they?

242
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,710
- Well...
- Come on, let's go upstairs.

243
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:35,389
I'm doin' a series of photographs.
You... you might be interested in this.

244
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,355
Photographs of teddy bears.

245
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:43,233
Lyin' in coffins!
I wanna make 'em into a book.

246
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:48,560
The final perfect comment
on the American way of... death.

247
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,034
All this folderol we put ourselves through.

248
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:56,316
Hate funerals. Hate any kind of folderol.

249
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,432
I'll show it to you when it's done.

250
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:02,639
Who knows?
Maybe you'd like to... write the text.

251
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,671
Not much of a view.

252
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:15,516
If I had a window in here I think
I'd just sit and stare at the lake all day.

253
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:21,271
This is where George Stark
came into being. Right here in this room.

254
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:25,195
- I noticed the old typewriter.
- Yeah, I've had that since I was a boy.

255
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,960
- I still use it. George doesn't.
- You're kidding.

256
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,515
No. George doesn't hold with typewriters.

257
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,188
George uses one of these.

258
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,149
From day one, he's used these.

259
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,229
You really are serious?

260
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,590
Dead serious. It's the truth.

261
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,398
- Was it hard to get George started?
- No.

262
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,750
One evening I was just sitting here.

263
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,315
I picked up one of these pencils.

264
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,638
Before I knew it, I'd written 16 pages
without a single scratch-out.

265
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,756
It was like George just...

266
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,235
...woke up and started to talk.

267
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,751
You'II, uh... forgive me for noting...

268
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,394
...but these behaviours
could be interpreted...

269
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:20,199
...as classic symptoms of schizophrenia.

270
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,432
Yes, I'll forgive you for noting that.

271
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,668
I don't think George would, though.

272
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:31,670
I don't think George would like any of this,
Mr Donaldson.

273
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,673
This isn't George's idea of a fun morning.

274
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:40,310
In fact, I think it's safe to say that George
would want your balls for breakfast.

275
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,919
- Thaddeus. Elizabeth.
- Hi, Digger.

276
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,640
I hope you don't mind crazy Homer.

277
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:09,998
- He wants to set up a fake tombstone.
- A fake tombstone?

278
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,953
"You don't want to go
walkin' on the dead" I says.

279
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:16,596
"Make sure you use an empty plot
where nobody's buried."

280
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,633
Then I remembered
"Thad Beaumont owns one"...

281
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:24,032
...that your daddy bought for you over here
near where your ma and pa is buried.

282
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,549
So I said "Why don't you use that?"

283
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,320
So, I hope you don't mind.

284
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,511
This is where Homer is settin' up.

285
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,712
GEORGE STARK 1985-1991
GEEN AARDIGE vENT

286
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:40,276
This was my idea. I was takin' pictures
of teddy bears when I thought of it.

287
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:44,548
Ain't it a hoot? I told you
I was gonna do this up brown for ya.

288
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:50,278
Must be strange for you, Thad.
Kinda like standing over your own grave.

289
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:54,309
You know, I just... I really think
that this is, you know, a little much.

290
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,636
- Yeah.
- Aw, it's good fun, is all.

291
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:00,196
- New York's gonna love it. Wait and see.
- The American way of death.

292
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,756
That's it! A little folderol
for old George there.

293
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:08,556
- Come on in now. We're losin' the light.
- Why not just take a couple of Thad?

294
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,671
All right. OK.

295
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:13,718
Come in near the stone.
I'll just be a minute now.

296
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,956
Damned if it don't look real.

297
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,350
- What are these?
- (Homer) That's it. That's it.

298
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,154
Now, how about you two, uh...

299
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,312
- (Homer) What? Oh. All right, all right.
- Oh, much better.

300
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,433
- How about you two shakin' hands?
- Shaking hands now?

301
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:31,240
Yeah, shakin' hands over top of the stone.

302
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,352
Come on! It's all in fun.
That's it. Now, smile.

303
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,869
Act like you're enjoyin'
the hell out of this.

304
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,753
- (Thad) Oh, we are.
- For all the world to see.

305
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:55,756
- (Liz) Are you sorry you did it?
- (Thad) I'm only sorry about two things.

306
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,269
One, we look like a pair of idiots.

307
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,869
What's number two?

308
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:04,311
(sighs) I just know we can't
hide from publicity any more.

309
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,319
We've had it pretty easy
in that department.

310
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:11,274
You'll be flavour of the month, they
forget you, then you win the Pulitzer.

311
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,671
- What else? Come on.
- Nothin'.

312
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,076
Honestly?

313
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,876
Honestly.

314
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,359
(Homer)
# There was an old skinflint named Dave

315
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,832
#Who kept a dead whore in a cave

316
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:34,350
# Dave said, I admit I'm a bit of a shit

317
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:38,229
# But think of the money I save, I save

318
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:41,148
# Oh, think of the mon...

319
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,633
You gotta be kiddin', pal.
At one in the damn a.m.?

320
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,389
Hey, that looks like...

321
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,510
What the hell...?

322
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:34,390
The American way of death, Homer.
Without any folderol!

323
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:04,789
Digger, calm down. I'll get somebody
over right away. Right away.

324
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,235
(clears throat) Digger Holt.

325
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,271
- Seein' ghosts again?
- Yep.

326
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,357
- Hm.
- Where's Norris?

327
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,596
Out on a call.
You want me to track him down?

328
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,519
- (phone rings)
- No. I'll go myself.

329
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,359
- I'll be over at Homeland.
- All right.

330
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,399
I'll be here. Castle Rock Police.

331
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,797
H... here we are, Sheriff.

332
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,275
Don't it look like what I said?

333
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:50,836
Don't it look like somebody
dug his way out of there?

334
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:55,552
Like somebody was buried alive
and dug his way out?

335
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:59,913
Someone dug a hole in your graveyard.
That's all it is, nothin' more.

336
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,589
But somebody was in there, Sheriff.

337
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,952
Look here.

338
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:10,358
He set his hands in the dirt here
to boost hisself out.

339
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:14,599
So whoever dug the hole
got down in it to do the diggin'.

340
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:18,190
You got yourself a clear case
of vandalism. That's the way I see it.

341
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,437
This is where they set up
for that picture in the magazine.

342
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,991
- Yeah. Picture of the Beaumonts. I saw it.
- Well, this here's the Beaumont plot.

343
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:29,954
And this hole is a-sittin' right smack
where they set up that fake tombstone.

344
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,037
It's just a hole in the ground.

345
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,835
Forget it, Digger.
Fill the damn thing in and forget it.

346
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:44,437
- Pangborn here.
- Yeah, Sheriff, it's Marty.

347
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:48,753
Me and Norris just found old Homer
Gamache, deader than a squashed coon.

348
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,837
(siren)

349
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,198
- Jesus!
- Guy across the street saw Homer...

350
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,392
...stop last night to pick up
a hitchhiker about, uh, 1am.

351
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,757
White male.
We figure he popped him for his truck.

352
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,235
We got a description out on it.

353
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:27,000
He took his leg. He took his damn leg.

354
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,472
No, he didn't take it. It's over there.

355
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:35,279
That's what he beat him with.
Beat him with his own wooden leg.

356
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,640
He was just an old man,
you son of a bitch.

357
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,991
Why didn't you just clip him one,
take his truck and leave him be?

358
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,388
Why this? I hope I get
a chance to ask you.

359
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,678
I want everybody in the world lookin'
for that truck. I wanna get this fucker.

360
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,554
Ask Mama if she believes this.

361
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:08,276
He drove it like this? All the way
from Maine, he drove it like this?

362
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,436
Ask Mama if she believes this.

363
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:32,234
- So, how was it? How was New York?
- Noisy.

364
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:37,673
God, I'm so sick of the same old
questions, over and over again.

365
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,469
"Tell us about the pencils."
"Why'd you give him a prison record?"

366
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,955
"Why do you suppose
Machine is so popular?"

367
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,632
- Thanks a lot, Donna.
- You're welcome. They were great.

368
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:51,429
Listen, I know they're a handful.
Say hi to your mom for me.

369
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,435
- Are you Elizabeth Beaumont?
- Yes.

370
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,754
- Alan?
- Is your husband home, Mrs Beaumont?

371
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,671
Well, yes, he is.
Alan, is there some kind of problem?

372
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,753
It's all right. I know these folks.
We have to talk to Thad, Liz.

373
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:09,159
Well, sure. Come on in. I'll call him.

374
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,355
Alan. What are you doin' in Ludlow?

375
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,755
Are you Thaddeus Beaumont?

376
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,837
Yeah.

377
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,157
What's goin' on, Alan?

378
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,039
We're here to question you
in connection with a capital crime.

379
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:32,312
- You have the right to remain silent...
- Jesus, what is this?

380
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:36,070
You have to right to legal counsel.
If you cannot afford legal counsel...

381
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,952
...such will be provided for you.

382
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,913
I don't know why you're 160 miles
out of your territory...

383
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:44,311
...Iookin' at me like I was birdshit
on a new car, but I'll tell you this:

384
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:47,557
I won't answer any questions
until you tell me what's goin' on.

385
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,796
It's about Homer Gamache.

386
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:50,637
Uh...

387
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:53,991
- Oh, the photographer. What about him?
- He's been murdered.

388
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,430
- Jesus. By who?
- Evidence says you did it.

389
00:31:56,680 --> 00:32:00,309
- This is a... Alan! This is a joke.
- Can you account for your whereabouts...

390
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:04,434
...during the time period from 11 pm
last Friday until 1am Saturday morning?

391
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:08,275
Yes. I was in New York.
I just got back today a little while ago.

392
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:13,270
- (Alan) How long were you there?
- I left Friday, four o'clock out of Bangor.

393
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:16,194
Anyone meet you there?
Did you do anything that night?

394
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:21,474
No. I... Let's see. I called my agent, Rick
Cowley, to let him know I was comin' in.

395
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,035
You called him, but you didn't see him.

396
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,277
- You think I'm lying to ya?
- There is that possibility...

397
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,357
...and I've got to consider it.

398
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:34,031
From what I know about you, you're not
the kind of person to do a thing like this.

399
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,470
None of that counts
when it comes to doin' my job.

400
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:39,319
Look, call TWA,
or the hotel, Sherry Netherland.

401
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,556
They must have a record
of when I checked in.

402
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,274
(Liz) We haven't been
up to Castle Rock for weeks.

403
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,438
Why are you so determined
to lay this off on Thad?

404
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:50,911
Because he thinks I did it. He thinks I did...

405
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,559
(twittering)

406
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:58,275
(Liz) Thad? Are you OK?

407
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,634
Honey, are you all right?

408
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,756
- (twittering subsides)
- Hm?

409
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,837
Are you OK?

410
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,429
Yeah. Yeah, I'm all right.

411
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,475
If this turns out to be a mistake...

412
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:18,071
...I will personally find the man who
screwed up this ID and pull his skin off.

413
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:22,876
What ID? What's this evidence you have?
I mean, why? Why me?

414
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:26,277
First off, there's the connection
between you and Homer.

415
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:30,075
- (Thad) The pictures.
- One was taken in Homeland Cemetery.

416
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,954
- Yeah. So?
- Someone went there Friday night...

417
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,310
...and dug a hole in your family plot.

418
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,591
A hole big enough to bury a man.

419
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,268
Homer was murdered
less than a mile away.

420
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:43,194
Look, Thad, this can't be.
Somebody is doing this to...

421
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,595
It's that creep. It's Clawson.

422
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,518
- Who?
- There's this guy, Fred Clawson.

423
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:53,554
Lives in New York. I don't know where. He
found out I wrote the George Stark books.

424
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:57,309
He was threatening to blackmail me.
That's why I went public.

425
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,318
We'll ask NYPD to check him out.

426
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,911
What else you got, Alan?

427
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:09,154
I don't believe you'd track me all the way
here just because of a hole in the ground.

428
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,276
The killer took Homer's pickup truck.

429
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:15,434
A Connecticut trooper found it in
a used-car lot just north of the state line.

430
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:20,196
They found fingerprints in the truck,
some of 'em stamped in Homer's blood.

431
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:25,031
They fed 'em into a graphics computer
and your service record came back.

432
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,196
Your prints match up.

433
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,277
Exactly.

434
00:34:56,680 --> 00:35:00,229
(EIvis Presley)
I wonder if... you're Ionesome tonight.

435
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:05,990
You know, someone said that the world's
a stage, and each of us must play a part.

436
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,590
Fate had me playing in love,
with you as my sweetheart.

437
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,476
Act One was when we met.

438
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,754
I loved you at first glance.

439
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,837
You read your lines so tenderly.

440
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,477
(eerie laughter)

441
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:27,356
Then came Act Two.
Using the change, you acted strange...

442
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,471
...and why, I'll never know.

443
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:38,677
(young Thad) Miss Bird said... brightly...

444
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,558
(Stark)
Down here, we call that fool's stuffing.

445
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:49,149
What do you mean, "down here"?

446
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:53,719
Endsville, Thad. The place
where all rail service terminates.

447
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,717
(toy squeaks)

448
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,673
You always were the clumsy one,
old Hoss.

449
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:05,149
Then they can bring the curtain down.

450
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:11,239
# Is your heart filled with pain?

451
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:15,952
# Shall I come back again?

452
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,948
# Tell me, dear

453
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:22,391
- #Are you Ionesome tonight?
- (Thad) Liz.

454
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,750
(Stark) I'm not done with you,
cock-knocker.

455
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,554
Remember that.
You don't wanna fuck with me.

456
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,149
Cos when you fuck with me...

457
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:37,275
...you're fuckin' with the best.

458
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,432
Clawson. There's police here to see you.

459
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,715
Clawson? You owe me two weeks' rent.

460
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,230
If these guys are here to take you away,
I want it now!

461
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,590
Let's check it out.

462
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,351
Jesus! (retches)

463
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,311
(Liz) He's back.

464
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,909
(knocking at door) Thad?

465
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,436
- He's back.
- Who's back?

466
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,318
Alan Pangborn.

467
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:12,993
I wondered if we could all just
sit down and have a cold one.

468
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,278
No.

469
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,357
Yeah. I'll have one.

470
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,591
I have no business bein' here...

471
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:27,272
...socialisin' with a man who is now
a suspect in not just one murder...

472
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,675
...but two.

473
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:33,196
- Two?
- Yeah. Your buddy. Frederick Clawson.

474
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,674
- (Liz) God!
- When?

475
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:39,277
Night before last.
In New York, while you were still there.

476
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,552
Night, uh... night before last.
Night before last, I was at...

477
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,150
You were at a press reception
till about 11 o'clock.

478
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,788
We think Clawson was killed
around nine or ten...

479
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,434
...but it could have been
as late as midnight.

480
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,990
We got another set of fingerprints
out of Clawson's apartment.

481
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,998
Once again, they match yours exactly.

482
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,509
Christ! What is going on, Thad?

483
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:05,030
Well, I'm surprised you brought beer,
not handcuffs.

484
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:07,800
- What's keepin' me outta jail?
- Me, I guess.

485
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,037
New York guys think
you should be brought in.

486
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:14,198
- Why are you lettin' me off the hook?
- I'm not.

487
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:17,233
You're still very much on the hook, Thad.

488
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,477
And if you killed these people,
I'm gonna pull you in the boat.

489
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:24,753
I figure you're not goin' anywhere.
Hard for a man like you to hide.

490
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:28,635
I'm willin' to let you sleep at home
while I work on this some more.

491
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:31,035
Meanwhile you build a case
to beat my alibis.

492
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:35,313
I'm not tryin' to beat your alibis
any more than I'm tryin' to prove 'em.

493
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:39,399
I was so sure it was Clawson.
Well, suppose he killed himself.

494
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:44,231
- He could make that look like Thad did it.
- The way he died, that's impossible.

495
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:48,194
Did anybody else know that
you and Clawson were connected?

496
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:52,029
Clawson got his information from
someone who works for my publisher.

497
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:56,518
That's all he told me. I don't have a name.
You mentioned the way he was killed.

498
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,439
Yeah. It looked like a, uh,
classic gangland hit.

499
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:02,990
- Shot?
- No, no. You don't shoot a blabbermouth.

500
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,555
You make him bleed. Make him suffer.

501
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,671
Clawson's tongue was cut out.

502
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:11,753
He was castrated
and his penis stuffed into his mouth.

503
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:16,317
That's exactly what I said
I wanted to do to him. I was joking.

504
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:20,434
I said if I was Alexis Machine,
that's exactly what I would do.

505
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,397
That's a character in one of his books.
Alexis Machine.

506
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,475
It was a joke.

507
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:31,589
Come on, Alan. Would I admit
that to you if I killed the guy?

508
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:39,231
There was somethin'
written on the wall at Clawson's.

509
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,193
Written in the victim's blood.

510
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,550
"The sparrows are flying again."

511
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,432
Does that mean anything to either of you?

512
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,716
- No.
- Thad?

513
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:53,036
No.

514
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,751
You're sure?

515
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:02,315
Doesn't mean a th... thing.

516
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:10,433
(Liz) You're keepin' secrets, Thad.
That's no good. It never was.

517
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:13,513
Some psychotic out there
has killed two people that we know...

518
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:16,029
...and has somehow
made it look like you did it.

519
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,435
This guy's obviously out to get you.

520
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,033
I mean, have you considered
that you might be in danger?

521
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:25,073
That all of us might be next
on this guy's hit list?

522
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:28,670
Now, come on, Thad. This is not
a good time to be holdin' things back.

523
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:31,229
No, it's not a good time.

524
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,515
The sparrows are flying again.

525
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:39,113
It means something to you. What is it?

526
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,396
Oh, Thad. What is goin' on?

527
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:51,356
There's more.

528
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:55,517
I wrote those words
and I don't remember doing it.

529
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:59,399
I was in some kind of... trance.

530
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:04,275
The tumour I had when I was a boy.
I told you about the headaches it caused.

531
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:07,148
- Did I ever tell you about the sounds?
- Sounds? No.

532
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:12,474
People with brain tumours sometimes
have symptoms, sensory precursors.

533
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:18,673
They smell things, hear things, that
aren't actually there. I used to hear birds.

534
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:22,748
I've started hearing them again.

535
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:29,236
Thad, you have to go and see the doctor.
Maybe you have another tumour.

536
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,477
That would explain the sounds.
But what about the rest of it?

537
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:35,558
Liz, I blanked out
for an entire period of time.

538
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:41,478
I wrote those words,
and I have no recollection of doing it.

539
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,198
I mean,
what if there are other things I've done?

540
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:49,313
What if there are other things I've done...
that I can't remember?

541
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,834
Thad! I'm delighted to see that
they haven't incarcerated you.

542
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:06,076
Sounds like the police have been in touch.

543
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:09,477
They wanted me to confirm that
you were a man of good character.

544
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,035
I lied, and told them that you were.

545
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,830
- Are you in trouble, Thad?
- I'm in somethin'.

546
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,270
Just a mix-up, I think, but it's got me goin'.

547
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,557
Any way I can help?

548
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:27,552
There's some weird shit goin' on. I could
use some help from an old witch doctor.

549
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:31,799
- Come, let's talk.
- I can't, Reggie. I'm... scrambled. I...

550
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,116
- Call if you need me.
- I will.

551
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:36,671
Thanks.

552
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,797
(twittering)

553
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,911
(wings fluttering)

554
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,718
(whispers) Endsville...

555
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:40,272
...for ever.

556
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:58,233
(EIvis Presley)
#Are you Ionesome tonight?

557
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:02,236
# Do you miss me tonight?

558
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:09,515
#Are you sorry we drifted apart?

559
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:24,317
Oh! Oh! Oh! No! No!

560
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:29,471
No! No! No!

561
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:34,273
Shut up, or I'll have to cut you, sis.

562
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:38,954
- What do you want?
- What'd I just say?

563
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:44,274
Now, you're gonna make us
a little telephone call, sissy.

564
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:54,314
(chuckles) No.
I know what you're thinking.

565
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:59,389
You're thinking you could brain me with
that thing. Not a very happy thought.

566
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:03,275
You know what happens to people
who lose their happy thoughts? Hm?

567
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,398
No!

568
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,272
Argh!

569
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,389
They fall out of the sky.

570
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:17,831
Now...

571
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:20,749
We're gonna call us Thad Beaumont.

572
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:29,274
- W... what do I say?
- Oh, you'll think of something.

573
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:32,199
(Thad) Hi.
We can't come to the phone right now...

574
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:35,278
...but if you leave your name
and number at the beep...

575
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:38,240
...we'll get back to you as soon as we can.

576
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:45,751
Sh.

577
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:51,075
Tell him who you are
and what's happenin' here.

578
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:54,238
Do it. Don't make me tell you twice.

579
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:59,039
Do it, or I'll cut
your fuckin' head off with this thing.

580
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:02,994
Thad! Thad, there's... there's a...

581
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:07,239
- Say your name.
...man here, there's a bad man here.

582
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,590
- Say your name.
- Miriam.

583
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:14,271
Please help me! There's a man here.
Please don't let him cut me any more!

584
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:23,436
(phone rings)

585
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:28,389
Pangborns... Sure.

586
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:30,272
Hey, Dad! Phone!

587
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:36,749
Turn it down a little, son.

588
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:40,912
- Yeah.
- It's Thad Beaumont.

589
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:44,277
- A lady in New York needs help fast.
- Go ahead. Shoot.

590
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:47,797
Miriam Cowley. My agent's ex-wife.
She called here. I wasn't home.

591
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,197
I got a recording on my machine.
And I heard a man's voice.

592
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:54,153
She said he was threatening to hurt her,
uh, to cut her.

593
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:56,629
She begged me
not to let him do that again.

594
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:59,559
I tried to call her back,
but couldn't get through.

595
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:02,149
- What's the address?
- 109 West 84th.

596
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:05,039
I was gonna call the New York police.

597
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:09,552
No, you did the right thing.
I'll call 'em. I can cut through the shit.

598
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:13,835
Give me a break here, son.

599
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,435
- Problem?
- Yep.

600
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,389
- Bad?
- Well, we can hope.

601
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:33,393
This is Alan Pangborn...

602
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:41,438
(phone rings)

603
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:43,750
Yeah? Yeah, hello?

604
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:46,671
Oh, God.

605
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:53,275
Miriam's dead.

606
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,437
Alan, I think there might be
some other people that are in danger.

607
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:08,549
Rick Cowley. I'm sure he's gonna go
after Rick. Now, he lives at 129 East 68th.

608
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:11,433
And, uh, the guy that wrote that article.

609
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:13,989
He'll probably go after him.
Mike Donaldson.

610
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:16,475
He lives in New York too,
but I'm not sure where.

611
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:19,319
What do you know
that you're not tellin' me?

612
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:21,909
I think I know who's doing these things.

613
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:24,275
- Give him to me.
- Not over the phone.

614
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:26,910
- Can you get here tomorrow?
- I need to know tonight.

615
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:28,911
Can't we do it tomorrow, face to face?

616
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:33,392
Look, I've been tryin' to cut you
every break I can. Don't stretch my limit.

617
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,435
I can give you a description.

618
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:42,270
I'm not entirely sure it's right...

619
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:46,475
...but I think it's close.

620
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,675
He's about my size,
blue eyes, same as mine.

621
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:59,994
Hair slicked back. About my age.
In better shape, though. Strong, muscular.

622
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:05,309
He lives in Oxford, Mississippi,
and he's got a little bit of a cracker accent.

623
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:08,788
He might be driving...

624
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,959
...an old black Toronado. It's got
a lot of blasting power under the hood.

625
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:15,958
It's got letters on the back.
"High Toned Son Of A Bitch".

626
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:18,674
You can tell me all this,
but not who the guy is?

627
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:21,274
Knowing his name tonight
isn't gonna help.

628
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,433
He's probably using
the name of George Stark.

629
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:46,751
Huh? Oh.

630
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:49,271
Shit!

631
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,876
Goddamn city.

632
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:19,277
(footsteps)

633
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,277
Oh, no.

634
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:37,350
(metallic click)

635
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:40,471
(whistling)

636
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:44,317
(baby cries)

637
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:15,277
Ow!

638
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,430
Argh!

639
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:20,238
Hello, Mike.

640
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:22,952
Goodbye, Mike.

641
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:31,515
Ah, Mikey, Mikey, Mikey.

642
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:43,109
Somebody help!

643
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:50,551
- What's going on?
- Murder.

644
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:53,750
D'you want some?

645
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:00,998
Whoops! Well, I guess I'd better punt.

646
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:08,075
(clears throat)

647
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:17,789
(whistles "Are you Lonesome Tonight?")

648
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:30,395
- What the hell is that down there?
- I don't know. Got your flashlight?

649
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:33,877
- Oh, look at this. Jesus fucking Christ.
- You think this is the guy?

650
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:37,152
- Is this the fuckin' guy...
- How the fuck do I know, huh?

651
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:39,993
- Christ!
- Oh, this is really some shit, man.

652
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:42,430
- Hey. Hey!
- Forget about it.

653
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:44,955
- Who the hell is that?
- I don't know. He's gone.

654
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:47,071
Oh, look at this shit.

655
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:49,191
(phone ringing)

656
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:03,515
- Hello.
- (Stark) Good mornin', Rick.

657
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:06,632
This is the man who cut
your woman's throat.

658
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,396
What?

659
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:13,389
- Who are you?
- Ask Thad Beaumont who I am.

660
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:17,872
He knows all about it. Tell him
I said you were walkin' around dead...

661
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:20,793
...and tell him I'm not done
makin' fool's stuffing yet.

662
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,036
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Who are you?

663
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:25,435
(Stark hangs up)

664
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:29,835
Oh, God! God!

665
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:59,391
Have a good one, man.

666
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:03,389
Jesus Christ! You asshole!

667
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:05,990
Fuck you!

668
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:14,435
(Alan) So tell me, Thad.
Who do you think is doin' this?

669
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:16,989
- Give me a name.
- I gave you a name.

670
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:19,317
The name is George Stark.

671
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:24,556
- I don't think I understand you.
- What my husband is trying to say...

672
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:28,355
...is that he thinks George Stark
has somehow come to life.

673
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:33,596
Now, look, Alan, I don't expect you to be
the type of guy to believe this, but, um...

674
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:35,791
...you're all we've got right now.

675
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,309
Thad has some things he's gonna tell you.

676
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:42,559
You don't have to believe him,
but you have to trust that he believes.

677
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:47,038
Because if you don't, this man,
or whatever he is, is gonna go on killing...

678
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:51,597
...and he's gonna keep on killing till
he gets to me and Thad and the babies.

679
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:31,309
You don't believe it, do you?
Not a single word of it.

680
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:34,956
If you'd told me these people
were murdered by a ghost...

681
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:37,037
...I wouldn't believe ya.

682
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:40,630
But I can come closer
to believin' a ghost story than this.

683
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:45,231
You're not just talkin' about a ghost,
you're talkin' about a man who never was.

684
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:47,795
Maybe you'd like to tell me
where this guy came from.

685
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:52,471
Did you just give birth to him one night?
Did he pop out of a damn sparrow's egg?

686
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:55,151
Exactly how did it go?

687
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:58,392
I don't know when
he became a separate person.

688
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:03,436
It was when we tried to kill him.

689
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:07,958
Look, I'm willing to consider
all sorts of crazy possibilities here.

690
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:11,072
But when you tell me
this guy is George Stark...

691
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:15,632
He might think he's George Stark,
I'll give you that.

692
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:17,756
But he's not. He can't be.

693
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:20,316
He's a crazy man, Thad.

694
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:24,115
A goddamn homicidal
lunatic crazy man is what he is.

695
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:28,239
And I'm gonna catch him.

696
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:42,559
Hold it, Mr Cowley. The guys from
communications are supposed to be here.

697
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:45,513
- Maybe they're inside.
- One should be right out here.

698
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:48,518
It's standard procedure. Come on.

699
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:16,432
- Maybe they never showed up.
- Let's try 'em on the radio.

700
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:20,036
- Where they comin' from? Downtown?
- I don't know. Call the precinct.

701
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:22,356
Look, I gotta get some sleep. I'm dead.

702
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:26,235
- We'll be here.
- Maybe we'll send out for Chinese later.

703
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:28,510
- My treat.
- Thanks.

704
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:50,076
Jesus Christ!

705
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:56,514
I've decided to change agents.

706
01:00:56,720 --> 01:01:00,315
I'm sorry, Rick. It's a cutthroat business.

707
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:22,349
(Thad) God! Oh, Jesus. Rick...

708
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:26,669
Rick is gone. I don't believe this.

709
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:31,709
I can't believe this. I mean, so much
for your fucking police protection!

710
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:35,988
(Thad) Oh, bullshit! Bullshit!

711
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:39,831
They didn't! No, they didn't!
I don't care what you think.

712
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:43,032
You wanna think about something?
Think about what I told you.

713
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:45,879
Think about George Stark.
Think about that!

714
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:47,553
What does he want?

715
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:52,436
He wants the same thing you and I would
want if we were in the same position.

716
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:54,989
He doesn't wanna be dead any more!

717
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:06,273
Jesus. Rick... Miriam.

718
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:10,036
Who's next?

719
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:14,756
I, uh... I think that's everything,
Mr Beaumont.

720
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:18,555
We'll call from the outside
to make sure the system's working.

721
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:20,671
OK, fine. Thank you.

722
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:21,875
(phone rings)

723
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:28,349
We don't have to make a test call. Pull
your meter. I'll check it out in the cellar.

724
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:45,795
Somebody gonna answer it?

725
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:49,549
Mr Beaumont?

726
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:52,320
- Something the matter?
- It's him.

727
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:54,909
It's who?

728
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,036
What do you want, you son of a bitch?

729
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:02,630
(Stark) Cool down, Thad.
No need to get your panties all in a bunch.

730
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:05,639
- What do you want?
- To tell you it's over.

731
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:10,271
I got the last one this noontime. Little girl
who used to work for your publisher.

732
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:14,070
The cops'll find her. Some of her is
on the floor. The rest is on the table.

733
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:16,236
Jesus Christ!

734
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:18,715
I'm gonna head down south
and do me some fishin'.

735
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:21,832
- This city life's tirin' me out.
- He's lying.

736
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:25,350
- You lying fuck.
- Why, Thad, that's not very nice.

737
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:29,389
Did you think I was gonna hurt you? Hell,
no. I was gettin' revenge for you, boy.

738
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:31,955
You knew all along
I was the one that had to do it.

739
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:35,357
- You got a chicken liver.
- He's lying. He knows you're listening.

740
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:38,438
I'm not gonna bother you any more, Thad.

741
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:42,671
I know you're gonna come after us,
George.

742
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:45,229
I know you're gonna come after me.

743
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:48,349
And I think I know what you want.

744
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:50,272
Well, you just come ahead.

745
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:52,596
I'll know you're comin'.

746
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:55,360
- I'll know because I'll hear the birds.
- Birds?

747
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:58,438
That's right.
I'll hear the birds, and I'll be waitin'.

748
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:00,511
Waitin' to fuckin' take you apart.

749
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:03,917
- Dear God!
- You're talkin' crazy, Thad. What birds?

750
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:06,116
Sparrows. Don't you hear the sparrows?

751
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:11,189
Well, whatever you're talkin' about
doesn't matter, because... this is over.

752
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:13,277
(hangs up)

753
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:21,359
- Clear as a bell.
- Let's check the van.

754
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:27,668
The call was made from
a payphone in Times Square.

755
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:31,992
They're checkin' to see if the voice
might have been a tape recording.

756
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:34,350
What, made by me?

757
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:38,350
Your calling-card number
was used to pay for the call.

758
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:42,438
Jesus. After all this, I'm still a suspect.

759
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:46,276
Look, I know they can't hang
last night's work on you. You were here.

760
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:50,712
- But they think you have an accomplice.
- That is the craziest thing I ever heard!

761
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:53,309
I wish I could say the same thing, Thad.

762
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:57,275
You gave me a description, remember?

763
01:04:57,680 --> 01:05:02,037
The witness at Donaldson's says the killer
matches that description perfectly.

764
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:04,674
You told me
he was driving a black Toronado.

765
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:09,755
The place where they found Homer's
pick-up says it was stolen off their lot.

766
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:16,274
That and the fingerprints. And you named
the victims before they were killed.

767
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:20,309
I mean, Jesus Christ, man.
What do you expect people to think?

768
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:24,229
- What do you think, Alan?
- I think some psycho's got it in for you.

769
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:26,755
Somebody clever enough
to go diggin' around...

770
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:30,316
...to find out things he could use
to make you look guilty.

771
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:32,590
It's either that or it's you, Thad.

772
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:36,110
It could be that somehow
you are behind all this.

773
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:38,959
Don't think I've written that possibility off.

774
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:41,037
Well, you'd better write it off.

775
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:44,312
Stop looking at me
and start lookin' over your shoulder.

776
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:47,671
It could be real unhealthy
for you if you don't.

777
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:07,069
- How ya doin', Mr Beaumont?
- Uh, I've been better, Rosalie.

778
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:09,430
Been better.

779
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:14,991
(phone rings)

780
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:21,191
(Rosalie) Hello?

781
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:25,590
It's for you, Mr Beaumont.

782
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:35,917
- Hello, George.
- (Stark) Thad. How's it hangin'?

783
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:38,310
- What do you want?
- You know the answer to that.

784
01:06:38,520 --> 01:06:42,479
You figured it out, and figured right.
It's time to start a new book.

785
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:46,593
Oh, I don't think so. I'm finished with you.
George Stark is dead.

786
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:49,837
(chuckles) I'm not dead, Hoss. Not hardly.

787
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:55,194
I'm just gettin' started. You better do
what I say or I'll be comin' for ya.

788
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:58,995
You will die like no other man
on earth has ever died before.

789
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:03,310
Start another book, boy.
Go home and sharpen your pencils.

790
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:05,431
(hangs up)

791
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,070
- Any calls?
- None that matter.

792
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:26,952
I'll be over home.

793
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:40,436
(whistles)

794
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:25,156
(clears throat)

795
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:27,909
(rewinds answering machine)

796
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:32,078
(beep)

797
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:35,556
(man) Hm. Guess I'll have to
call you back, Sheriff.

798
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:41,516
(beep)

799
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:44,077
Oh, God.

800
01:08:44,280 --> 01:08:46,475
Oh, Jesus, Annie. I'm sorry.

801
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:50,198
- Darlin', I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- It's OK.

802
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:55,713
God. I didn't realise
how jumpy I've been gettin'.

803
01:08:56,480 --> 01:08:58,835
This Beaumont business.

804
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:01,751
What's he like? Beaumont.

805
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:07,039
How do you know?
How do you ever know?

806
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:38,995
I'm taking him to work. Maybe you should
send another unit out to watch the house.

807
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:55,632
Come on.
Come on, get over here. That's good.

808
01:09:56,840 --> 01:09:58,671
Here. (squeezes squeaky toy)

809
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:02,071
Look, if you can't...
Look, this is your favourite toy.

810
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:04,271
Would you... would you guys please...

811
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:07,552
Just please be...
Would you guys please shut up?

812
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:46,317
I'll be a coupla hours.

813
01:10:46,680 --> 01:10:49,433
- You want some coffee?
- I've got my thermos.

814
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:21,311
Let me in, George.

815
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:24,789
Come on, George.
Let me come visit for a while.

816
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,275
Let me see what the hell you're up to.

817
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,389
Come on, George. Let me in.

818
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:45,837
Oh, God.

819
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:12,672
They're real.

820
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:15,308
The sparrows are real.

821
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:19,276
(eerie twittering)

822
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:53,996
Why... do you want to write again?

823
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:06,515
Why do you say that?

824
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:16,070
Falling apart?

825
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:20,278
Falling... apart.

826
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:23,357
How?

827
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:26,356
How must we fall?

828
01:13:27,080 --> 01:13:30,311
Tell me... why, George.

829
01:13:36,040 --> 01:13:37,951
What?

830
01:13:58,440 --> 01:14:00,237
Agh!

831
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:15,194
(Stark) Smarts, don't it, Thad?

832
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:19,315
Hurts like a real son of a bitch.

833
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:23,189
I sure hope you can take it, Hoss.

834
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:29,191
Now...

835
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:34,835
Take it like a man.

836
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:40,077
Oh, yeah.

837
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:56,395
Like a man.

838
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:09,837
Agh.

839
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:13,396
Agh.

840
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:17,431
Agh.

841
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:39,079
- Where are you going?
- Bangor.

842
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:41,919
- What's in Bangor?
- I don't know. Maybe nothing.

843
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:45,390
- It's where I had surgery as a boy.
- Here. Take these.

844
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:47,750
A disguise.

845
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:52,436
A changed man. Car key.

846
01:15:52,680 --> 01:15:56,514
I hope you'll have the decency to stand
good for any repairs if it gets wounded.

847
01:15:56,720 --> 01:15:59,757
- How will you get home?
- A cab, I imagine.

848
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:04,033
I'll get a receipt and present it
to you at the proper moment.

849
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:07,915
- Thanks, old friend.
- Thank you for bringing adventure.

850
01:16:09,320 --> 01:16:13,029
Just for fun, see if you can find
anything in your books about sparrows.

851
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:15,356
Sparrows?

852
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:17,951
Sparrows...

853
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:23,748
There is something about sparrows.

854
01:17:12,720 --> 01:17:13,550
(Thad) A twin?

855
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:15,679
They never told you?

856
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:18,274
No. No, they said it was a tumour.

857
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:23,230
Well... in a way, that's all it was.

858
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:27,551
Foreign matter that happened
to wind up in your head.

859
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:32,349
I don't see anything, Thad,
but if you're hearing things again...

860
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:34,994
...we'd better shoot some pictures.

861
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:38,109
A great many of us start out as twins.

862
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:41,039
At least one in ten, probably more.

863
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:46,394
The stronger fetus absorbs the weaker
and comes to birth as a single child.

864
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:51,756
In your case,
the fetus wasn't completely absorbed...

865
01:17:52,280 --> 01:17:55,272
...and it had to be removed surgically.

866
01:17:55,680 --> 01:17:59,389
Your mom and dad were
pretty rattled by the whole thing.

867
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:04,229
They insisted that the excised tissue
be treated as human remains...

868
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:06,351
...and signed over to them.

869
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:09,074
- They wanted to bury it.
- Bury it.

870
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:12,397
In Homeland Cemetery, in the family plot.

871
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:14,511
Don't know.

872
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:19,752
- They ever tell you about the sparrows?
- The sparrows?

873
01:18:19,960 --> 01:18:23,350
It was the damnedest thing.
We'd just finished your surgery...

874
01:18:23,680 --> 01:18:28,470
...when this enormous flock of sparrows,
thousands of them...

875
01:18:28,680 --> 01:18:31,319
...came swarming down onto the hospital.

876
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:33,590
They never figured out
what the hell it was.

877
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:36,030
Some kind of migration or something.

878
01:18:36,240 --> 01:18:40,677
Made a hell of a mess. Windows broke.
Three or four people got hurt.

879
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,673
You're... bleeding pretty good there.

880
01:18:46,160 --> 01:18:48,549
Let me put a proper dressing on that.

881
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:53,273
- What did you say it was? A cut?
- Oh, uh...

882
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,468
No, I, uh... poked myself.

883
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:03,869
It'll stick in my mind for ever.

884
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:06,640
You complaining about
those bird sounds, and...

885
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:09,234
...us getting hit by those sparrows.

886
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,673
It was like we took
the sound out of your head...

887
01:19:12,840 --> 01:19:14,990
...and it... came to life.

888
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:19,436
Howdy, Doc. Remember me?

889
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,116
(car horn)

890
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:26,077
Jesus!

891
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:34,275
You bastard.

892
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:35,635
Jesus.

893
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:37,950
(phone ringing)

894
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:44,679
- Hello?
- You gotta get out of there right now.

895
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:48,594
- Thad? What are you talk...
- He's here. Stark is here in Bangor.

896
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:51,473
That's 20 minutes away.
Get the hell out of there now.

897
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:55,229
- What are you doing in Bangor?
- Liz, please! Just listen to me.

898
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:59,353
Get out of there, all right?
There's no time. He's killed Doc Pritchard.

899
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:03,389
- He's gonna come after you and the kids.
- All right. All right, we'll go.

900
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:06,752
- No, promise me. Promise me.
- I promise you we'll go. We'll go now.

901
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:09,030
Don't pack anything. Just get the hell out.

902
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:11,151
Wait. How do I get in touch with you?

903
01:21:11,320 --> 01:21:13,276
Through the school. Just, um...

904
01:21:13,480 --> 01:21:16,711
Uh, Reggie. Don't tell her
where you're going or where you are.

905
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:20,230
Tell her you're safe. Don't tell anyone
who might tell me where you are.

906
01:21:20,440 --> 01:21:22,749
I can't know. Do you understand me?

907
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:26,670
- I cannot know where you are.
- All right, we'll go.

908
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:29,797
I love you, Liz.

909
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:33,273
I love you. I love you more than anything.

910
01:21:35,560 --> 01:21:37,949
- I love you.
- (Thad hangs up)

911
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:51,355
OK, listen.
Mommy's gonna take you on a little ride...

912
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:54,999
Shit.

913
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,514
I got a despatch. Code six.

914
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:08,949
Uh, there's been, uh...

915
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:11,989
You better call an ambulance. There's...

916
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:15,317
- Ambulance?
- Call an ambulance.

917
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:20,875
For God's sakes, we're in danger here,
Alan. My babies are in danger.

918
01:22:21,080 --> 01:22:24,834
I can't let you just go runnin' off.
Even if I wanted to, I couldn't let you.

919
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:29,238
- But Stark could be out there.
- There is no George Stark, Elizabeth.

920
01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:32,477
- He doesn't exist.
- Somebody exists. Thad said he saw him.

921
01:22:32,680 --> 01:22:37,435
I don't give a damn what Thad said. Your
husband ought to be in the county jail...

922
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:42,151
...and I'm startin' to feel like a damn idiot
for not puttin' him there a long time ago.

923
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:44,788
You're just gonna have to
sit tight and ride this out.

924
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:48,276
Nothing is going to happen.
You're under police protection.

925
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:52,389
- Am I under protection, or under arrest?
- You call it what you like.

926
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:54,989
I'm sorry, Liz.
I've been way too soft on this thing.

927
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:59,034
I've gotta start goin' by the book.
Now let me talk to the officer there.

928
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:03,075
He wants to talk to you.

929
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:06,470
- Yes, sir?
- Just hold the fort there, son.

930
01:23:06,680 --> 01:23:11,310
I'll have two units out to replace you
before nightfall. Keep your eyes open.

931
01:23:11,680 --> 01:23:15,992
If Thad Beaumont shows up, you pull
him in on suspicion... Murder one.

932
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:18,749
Yes, sir. Got it covered, sir.

933
01:23:26,240 --> 01:23:31,917
I think the absorbed fetus was merely
a vessel, a stolen body, if you like.

934
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:36,437
It just happened to be there,
wholly by accident, and Stark used it.

935
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:40,479
He took it for his own.
Stark is a conjuration...

936
01:23:40,680 --> 01:23:44,673
...an entity created by
the force of your will.

937
01:23:45,240 --> 01:23:49,074
We all have something
of the beast inside us.

938
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:52,272
We can either suppress it or encourage it.

939
01:23:52,480 --> 01:23:55,040
In your case, you encouraged it too much.

940
01:23:55,240 --> 01:23:58,038
In your subconscious,
you wanted it to live.

941
01:23:58,240 --> 01:24:01,516
You wanted it so badly,
it actually came to be.

942
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:06,115
Your characters have always
been vividly written, Thad.

943
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:09,270
I wanted him to live.

944
01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:14,194
God forgive me, it's true.

945
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:17,119
A part of me has always
admired George Stark.

946
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:19,840
Admired his simple, violent nature.

947
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:24,678
A man who doesn't stumble over things,
who never looks weak or silly.

948
01:24:25,240 --> 01:24:28,277
A man with a straight,
sharp answer for everything.

949
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:31,313
Yes. But he's a bastard.

950
01:24:31,680 --> 01:24:33,318
Half of me is a bastard.

951
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:36,231
My dark half.

952
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:38,271
George Stark is my dark half.

953
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:41,392
Yeah, but surely you don't
want him to stay alive.

954
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:44,677
I mean, you can't still admire him
after all that he's done.

955
01:24:44,840 --> 01:24:48,435
- No.
- If you don't want him, he can't remain.

956
01:24:48,680 --> 01:24:53,037
You're the one with life, real life.
He's trying to take it away from you.

957
01:24:53,240 --> 01:24:55,800
But if you're not willing to give it up...

958
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,116
...what can he do?

959
01:24:59,240 --> 01:25:02,949
Kill you?
That would be suicide, wouldn't it?

960
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:10,275
Why didn't I see that? He can't hurt me,
so he's going after the people around me.

961
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:12,272
Exactly.

962
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:16,833
I found something in Barringer's here.

963
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:19,031
Something about sparrows.

964
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:23,559
Whippoorwills, loons and sparrows...

965
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:27,353
...are psychopomps.
- What?

966
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:31,275
From the Greek.
It means "those who conduct".

967
01:25:32,440 --> 01:25:36,194
In this case,
those who conduct human souls...

968
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:41,315
...back and forth between the land
of the living and the land of the dead.

969
01:25:42,040 --> 01:25:43,951
(phone rings)

970
01:25:48,680 --> 01:25:50,557
Hello?

971
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:53,395
Thad! It's for you.

972
01:26:02,160 --> 01:26:06,073
I'm not gonna write your book, George.
You're dead. And dead you're gonna stay!

973
01:26:06,280 --> 01:26:08,953
(Stark) You're wrong, old Hoss.
You wanna get started.

974
01:26:09,160 --> 01:26:14,439
Start by nightfall or you'll be a sorry
son of a bitch. You won't be the only one.

975
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:18,673
See if you can figure out where
I'm callin' from, Thad. (toy squeaks)

976
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:20,671
(hangs up)

977
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:22,990
No!

978
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:30,239
- That was quick, Hoss.
- What have you done to them?

979
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:32,317
Not a thing... yet. Not to your people.

980
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:35,990
I had to do a few things to that
state trooper watchin' your house.

981
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:39,237
What's left of him is out
in his bubble-mobile drawin' flies.

982
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:42,273
- Let me talk to Liz.
- No time. Gotta go, buddy-roo.

983
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:46,553
Me and the family, we gotta ride. I think
you know where we're all be headin'.

984
01:26:46,760 --> 01:26:48,671
Endsville, Thad.

985
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:51,912
That place where
all rail service terminates.

986
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:56,039
Oh. In case you're wonderin',
I cut the tracer on your phone here.

987
01:26:56,240 --> 01:26:59,710
I figure this is private business,
just between you and me.

988
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:02,036
(hangs up)

989
01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:09,357
The trace...

990
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:14,314
Jesus, the phone trace. They heard
my call, they wouldn't let her go.

991
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:18,433
He's got Liz, Reggie. He's got my children.

992
01:27:18,680 --> 01:27:23,276
Be careful. Remember, he knows as
much about you as you know about him.

993
01:27:23,480 --> 01:27:26,040
Don't let him seduce you. Don't...

994
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:35,918
They've come to take one of us away,
haven't they?

995
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:38,790
- Which one?
- The loser, of course.

996
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:41,874
I do hope it's not you, Thaddeus.

997
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:46,437
I'd hate to think of George Stark
taking over your lecture group.

998
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:49,831
- (Thad) Why isn't he aware of them?
- I don't know.

999
01:27:50,040 --> 01:27:53,316
- Let's take it as a good sign.
- I thought you knew about this shit.

1000
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:58,150
I don't know about any of it.
Nobody does, except the Almighty, and...

1001
01:27:58,320 --> 01:28:00,515
...he seems to be on sabbatical.

1002
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:04,834
In the end, it's what you believe.

1003
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:07,793
I wish I had a talisman to give you,
or a silver bullet...

1004
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,309
...or a stake to drive
through the monster's heart.

1005
01:28:10,520 --> 01:28:13,478
- But it's not that simple.
- You've given me all I need.

1006
01:28:13,680 --> 01:28:15,796
Thanks, Reggie.

1007
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:21,556
Good luck. It'll be interesting to see
who's sitting in your office next week.

1008
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:25,435
- I'll be there.
- Wear a red carnation so I know it's you.

1009
01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:45,799
I got a dead officer. I call that trouble.
We're pretty sure that Beaumont did it.

1010
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,309
- (Alan) Why's that?
- Well, he's outta here.

1011
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:51,353
He apparently took his family with him,
unless he cut them up.

1012
01:28:51,560 --> 01:28:55,269
He killed that doctor in Bangor.
We got a positive ID from the receptionist.

1013
01:28:55,480 --> 01:28:57,710
If he's heading to his place up there...

1014
01:28:57,920 --> 01:29:01,754
...it would be real nice if you
were there to stop his fucking clock.

1015
01:29:01,960 --> 01:29:04,076
You got it. Fine.

1016
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:23,349
Come on.

1017
01:29:25,240 --> 01:29:26,958
Oh, shit.

1018
01:29:27,160 --> 01:29:29,037
(sirens)

1019
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:33,155
Just keep on goin'.

1020
01:29:33,320 --> 01:29:35,356
Keep on goin'.

1021
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:08,230
Me and Thad, we're gonna be doin' some
collaboratin', just like we always done.

1022
01:30:08,440 --> 01:30:11,034
When it's over,
if you haven't pissed me off too bad...

1023
01:30:11,240 --> 01:30:13,800
...I might just decide to let you go.

1024
01:30:14,240 --> 01:30:18,358
But you understand,
it all depends on what kinda mood I'm in.

1025
01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:21,956
If I'm in a good mood, a peaceful mood...

1026
01:30:22,160 --> 01:30:24,435
...who knows what kinda turn
things might take?

1027
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:27,273
When all this is over I might
settle down up this way...

1028
01:30:27,480 --> 01:30:30,756
...and I sure would want you
to think kindly of me.

1029
01:30:31,360 --> 01:30:33,749
I like it here. I purely do.

1030
01:30:35,480 --> 01:30:38,233
Yeah, I could get real comfortable here.

1031
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:43,909
(chuckles)

1032
01:30:44,080 --> 01:30:46,514
Dream on, motherfucker.

1033
01:30:52,600 --> 01:30:54,989
This is no dream, Beth.

1034
01:31:00,280 --> 01:31:02,316
Thad owes me.

1035
01:31:02,520 --> 01:31:05,318
Maybe he knew how to write
before I showed up...

1036
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:08,193
...but I taught him to write
stuff people wanna read.

1037
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:12,473
Ain't no good writin' a thing
if people don't wanna read it.

1038
01:31:12,680 --> 01:31:15,035
That's why I says Thad owes me.

1039
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:18,432
So you come after me,
you come after my children.

1040
01:31:19,720 --> 01:31:22,075
You're a coward.

1041
01:31:24,320 --> 01:31:27,471
You would do better
not to say things like that.

1042
01:31:33,320 --> 01:31:35,788
Hell, I didn't want any of this trouble.

1043
01:31:36,680 --> 01:31:40,070
Believe it or not,
I prefer to steer south of trouble.

1044
01:31:40,280 --> 01:31:42,748
This writin' we gotta do,
I tried to do it by myself.

1045
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:45,155
It was comin' along good, too.

1046
01:31:45,320 --> 01:31:47,515
Well, then I developed this, uh...

1047
01:31:53,400 --> 01:31:55,516
...physical problem.

1048
01:31:55,720 --> 01:31:57,756
I guess you noticed.

1049
01:31:57,960 --> 01:32:00,474
Well, don't worry. I'll be better soon.

1050
01:32:03,240 --> 01:32:05,151
Thad's gonna make me well.

1051
01:32:05,320 --> 01:32:10,633
All's he got to do is write this one last
story and I'll be rockin' and rollin' again.

1052
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:13,758
Now, of course,
he might start feelin' poorly...

1053
01:32:13,960 --> 01:32:16,758
...and workin' so... close together and all...

1054
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:20,270
...he might just go and catch
whatever this is that I got.

1055
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:24,837
That'd be a shame. I don't wish
the boy any harm, truly I don't.

1056
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:26,951
I hope it turns out different.

1057
01:32:27,160 --> 01:32:31,711
But I got the feelin' that one or the other
of us is gonna have to fold his hand.

1058
01:32:32,320 --> 01:32:35,949
And when it comes down to that
it's better him than me.

1059
01:32:37,360 --> 01:32:39,271
My God.

1060
01:32:41,320 --> 01:32:45,996
- Oh, my God, you really are...
- You're disturbin' my peaceful mood.

1061
01:32:48,160 --> 01:32:51,630
You are disturbin'
the peaceful frame of mind I'm in.

1062
01:32:52,760 --> 01:32:56,309
You are disturbin'
my peaceful frame of mind.

1063
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:05,276
(EIvis Presley)
I wonder if... you're Ionesome tonight.

1064
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:10,758
You know, someone said that the world's
a stage, and each of us must play a part.

1065
01:34:12,320 --> 01:34:15,790
- Fate had me playing in love...
- Liz.

1066
01:34:17,480 --> 01:34:19,755
Oh, God, Liz. Are you all right?

1067
01:34:19,960 --> 01:34:22,520
Huh? Are you OK?
The kids. Where are the kids?

1068
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:24,915
Right here, Hoss.

1069
01:34:27,560 --> 01:34:29,471
(switches music off)

1070
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:32,992
Hello, Thad. How are you, old buddy?

1071
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:37,435
- You look a little peaky.
- You don't look so hot yourself.

1072
01:34:40,160 --> 01:34:42,276
(Stark chuckles)

1073
01:34:45,280 --> 01:34:49,034
Lf... I do what you want me to do...

1074
01:34:50,600 --> 01:34:52,989
...you promise not to hurt them.

1075
01:34:55,400 --> 01:34:57,550
If I do what you want...

1076
01:34:58,600 --> 01:35:00,955
...will you leave them alone?

1077
01:35:01,160 --> 01:35:03,310
I will. I promise.

1078
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:07,115
You have my word,
the word of a Southern man...

1079
01:35:07,320 --> 01:35:09,515
...which is not given lightly.

1080
01:35:10,760 --> 01:35:13,911
- Let me have them.
- You can have one.

1081
01:35:41,680 --> 01:35:45,434
Liz, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry for all this.

1082
01:35:48,520 --> 01:35:51,796
- I'm gonna go upstairs with him.
- No. Thad, you can't.

1083
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:54,275
We don't have a choice.

1084
01:35:55,560 --> 01:35:59,269
He can't hurt me. He won't. But he
can hurt you if you give him a reason.

1085
01:35:59,480 --> 01:36:04,793
Don't be thinkin' about breakin' loose,
don't be thinkin' about the telephone...

1086
01:36:06,040 --> 01:36:09,953
Guess we're on the same wavelength.
Ain't that right, Thad?

1087
01:36:11,480 --> 01:36:14,313
Don't you see what's happening?
Just look at him.

1088
01:36:14,520 --> 01:36:16,590
He doesn't want help writing a book.

1089
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:20,076
He wants to take over your life.
Can't you see that?

1090
01:36:20,720 --> 01:36:22,995
I know what he wants.

1091
01:36:25,320 --> 01:36:29,233
What I don't know and what he doesn't
know is whether this'll really save him.

1092
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:33,228
I don't think it will save him.
I think he's finished.

1093
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:35,715
You know why?

1094
01:36:36,320 --> 01:36:39,153
Cos I don't want him around any more.

1095
01:36:39,320 --> 01:36:42,835
There's only one way to find out
who's finished and who's not.

1096
01:36:43,040 --> 01:36:45,429
Ain't that right, Thad?

1097
01:36:49,360 --> 01:36:51,271
Are you ready?

1098
01:36:51,480 --> 01:36:53,675
Just waitin' on you.

1099
01:37:19,480 --> 01:37:21,357
Yeah...

1100
01:37:53,200 --> 01:37:55,316
(fluttering)

1101
01:38:17,200 --> 01:38:20,158
(Thad) I'll start with Machine
stealing the police car.

1102
01:38:20,320 --> 01:38:21,799
Yes, that's right.

1103
01:38:55,480 --> 01:38:57,596
(fluttering)

1104
01:39:08,840 --> 01:39:11,593
- Give me a cigarette.
- I thought you quit.

1105
01:39:11,800 --> 01:39:13,438
I did.

1106
01:39:16,520 --> 01:39:18,988
Except for times like this.

1107
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:28,633
Times when me and you
are workin' together.

1108
01:40:08,680 --> 01:40:10,796
(fluttering)

1109
01:40:16,320 --> 01:40:16,832
Thad.

1110
01:40:29,840 --> 01:40:31,876
Why don't you try, George?

1111
01:40:32,080 --> 01:40:34,435
You gotta break in.

1112
01:40:52,040 --> 01:40:53,951
I'm scared, Hoss.

1113
01:40:54,160 --> 01:40:57,072
Oh, you know the only way to do it...

1114
01:40:57,280 --> 01:40:59,430
...is to do it.

1115
01:41:45,400 --> 01:41:47,277
(mutters)

1116
01:41:49,320 --> 01:41:51,276
(fluttering)

1117
01:41:52,440 --> 01:41:54,317
(Stark chuckles)

1118
01:41:56,080 --> 01:41:58,275
(frenzied twittering)

1119
01:43:04,040 --> 01:43:06,429
(glass shatters)

1120
01:43:08,320 --> 01:43:10,595
It's comin', Thad.

1121
01:43:11,320 --> 01:43:14,517
It's comin' easy, it's comin' good.

1122
01:43:15,440 --> 01:43:18,352
I can do it. I can do it.

1123
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:24,399
You shouldn't fuck with me, Hoss.

1124
01:43:26,160 --> 01:43:28,958
Don't you know I can tell
what you're thinkin'?

1125
01:43:29,480 --> 01:43:32,995
Stop it, Thad.
Stop it, or I'm gonna have to cut ya.

1126
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:37,470
You're not gonna cut me, George.
You can't do shit to me and you know it.

1127
01:43:37,680 --> 01:43:40,274
I can do some shit
to the other folks around here.

1128
01:43:40,680 --> 01:43:43,399
Yes, sir,
I can do some real ugly shit to them.

1129
01:43:44,480 --> 01:43:46,357
Sit down, Thad.

1130
01:43:46,560 --> 01:43:48,596
Make it easy on yourself.

1131
01:43:49,320 --> 01:43:52,278
Sit down and... shut your eyes.

1132
01:43:52,960 --> 01:43:55,315
See if you can't just...

1133
01:43:57,160 --> 01:43:59,310
...drift on off.

1134
01:43:59,520 --> 01:44:01,272
You go to hell.

1135
01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:41,750
(fluttering)

1136
01:45:49,360 --> 01:45:51,828
They've come to take you away, George.

1137
01:45:52,040 --> 01:45:54,429
Take you back to the devil.

1138
01:45:56,200 --> 01:45:58,077
(child gurgles)

1139
01:46:14,240 --> 01:46:16,151
(Liz) Thad?

1140
01:46:16,760 --> 01:46:18,671
Thad!

1141
01:46:18,840 --> 01:46:21,957
OK. You sit here.
I gotta open the door now.

1142
01:46:38,400 --> 01:46:40,914
I didn't want it to be like this, Hoss.

1143
01:46:43,320 --> 01:46:45,754
I had a different sort of thing in mind.

1144
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:48,513
Yes, I did.

1145
01:46:56,600 --> 01:46:59,512
They've come to write the ending, George.

1146
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:04,549
Is it gonna be your ending... or mine?

1147
01:47:04,760 --> 01:47:06,671
(thudding)

1148
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,389
Kinda clumsy there, George.

1149
01:47:31,280 --> 01:47:35,956
I'm gonna... I'm gonna give you...
one last chance here, Thad.

1150
01:47:37,280 --> 01:47:39,396
Stop whatever it is that you're doin' here.

1151
01:47:39,600 --> 01:47:41,909
I'm not doin' anything, Hoss.

1152
01:47:42,600 --> 01:47:46,115
I'm just waitin' around
to see how things turn out.

1153
01:47:53,600 --> 01:47:56,194
Stop it, Thad. Stop it.

1154
01:47:56,400 --> 01:47:59,392
I'm sorry, George. I can't.

1155
01:48:02,080 --> 01:48:04,275
Neither can you.

1156
01:48:06,480 --> 01:48:08,835
The ending, huh?

1157
01:48:10,840 --> 01:48:14,150
Well, let's see how you like this ending,
Hoss.

1158
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:23,716
No!

1159
01:48:23,920 --> 01:48:26,115
(gun fires)

1160
01:48:26,320 --> 01:48:28,276
(creaking)

1161
01:48:43,320 --> 01:48:45,276
(screams)

1162
01:49:04,440 --> 01:49:05,634
Alan!

1163
01:49:10,480 --> 01:49:12,869
Hurry up!

1164
01:49:13,080 --> 01:49:16,390
- What the hell's goin' on? What is this?
- They're upstairs.

1165
01:49:16,600 --> 01:49:18,158
- Who?
- He took them upstairs.

1166
01:49:18,320 --> 01:49:20,754
- Where's Thad?
- He's upstairs. He's with Stark.

1167
01:49:20,960 --> 01:49:23,315
- Hold still!
- He's got the kids upstairs.

1168
01:49:23,520 --> 01:49:25,192
Liz, no! No!

1169
01:49:52,080 --> 01:49:54,230
Wait! Wait here!

1170
01:50:06,360 --> 01:50:08,510
(Stark screaming)

1171
01:50:43,400 --> 01:50:45,311
Liz.
