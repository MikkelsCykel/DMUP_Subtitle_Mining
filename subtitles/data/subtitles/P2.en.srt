Yes Mister, already rescribed the contract

3
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,072
Did you make the changes that I told you?

4
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:31,750
If, I included the increase of the 4
% in the 10 extra millions.

5
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:36,351
No, no, it is not it is this way the one
4% of the 10 millions.

6
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:39,353
No, that was what you/they told me.

7
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:41,150
- Who did tell you that?
- The lawyers... 

8
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:44,286
They are some idiots, and not
I understand its lack of communication.

00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:48,295
No, this well, didn't have
it forms that he/she had known.

10
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:50,160
Ok, this is what I want that you make.

11
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:52,394
- He/she could wait a little.
- This well.

12
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,162
Thank you...  Hello Jody.

13
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:56,408
Mr. Harper wants
to see you in their office.

15
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:01,846
You know that this well, you don't have that
to make it, I have not even finished.

16
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:03,515
- You go home.
- Sure?

17
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:05,741
If, it is late, I don't want
that your parents worry.

18
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,850
Veto of here, ok.

19
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:10,653

20
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:24,034
Hello, Lorraine, undoubtedly I will go.

21
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:27,533
Allow me to call you of turn.

22
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,475
In some minutes I promise it to you.

23
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,170
Still working in the contract.

24
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:38,046
What can I make for you?

25
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,954
One doesn't eat... 

26
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:49,360
I feel bad with what I happen... 

27
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,261
This well, this ok.

28
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:53,260
Don't worry for that reason.

29
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:55,091
Not this well.

30
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:57,859
I sit down as an idiot.

31
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:02,537
Take too much and you know as
they are the navidad parties.

32
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:08,706
We had a he/she drinks the year
past, it has been a difficult year.

33
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:11,712
For sure if.

34
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:15,449
Alone he/she loved you
that I really sit down it.

35
00:04:17,223 --> 00:04:18,815
These excused.

36
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:21,321
Thank you.

37
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:23,927
Merry Christmas Angela.

38
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:26,022
Your also Jim.

39
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:41,370
You call me of the work, I thought
that you went first home.

40
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:44,242
Don't worry, I have everything with me.

41
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,974
- They come for here Angi.
- Coarse.

42
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:49,255
You picked up the disguise of Santa,
do I hope you didn't forget?

43
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,355
Don't forget it, this in the car.

44
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:54,388
I believe that potato this but
excited that the children.

45
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,551
Believe me I don't see the one
moment of leaving of here.

46
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,397
Jimmy puts that of turn
there, we will already eat.

47
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,531
You will already eat now.

48
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:04,794
- He/she suckles I want it.
- Then wait.

49
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:08,196
- Please, don't arrive late.
- I won't make it, I promise it to you.

50
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:10,204
- Ok, good-bye.
- Good-bye.

51
00:05:57,056 --> 00:05:58,250
My God.

52
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:03,092
I sit down it, he/she was closing the floors.

53
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:05,897
Not I thought that nobody was
working so late.

54
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:08,226
If, me neither.
- I sit down it.

55
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:09,729
I will return later.

56
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:14,105
If it doesn't bother you to wait,
I close my office and first floor with you.

57
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:16,600
- Ok, this well.
- Two seconds.

58
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:19,606
Do you work the whole night?

59
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:22,644
They closed the building
for next 2 days.

60
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:24,209
I also have a new service.

61
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:25,940
That is good.

62
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,915
I hope to be able to arrive on time for
to open the gifts with my girls.

63
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:30,622
- How are they?
- Well.

64
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:34,723
- We go your parents they don't support me.
- That is not certain, they love you.

65
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:37,623
Where do you go tonight?

66
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:39,729
I will go to my sister's house in Jersey.

67
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:42,931
I thought that serious of another place.

68
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:45,934
If, a piece of my if.

69
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:49,340
- I grew in a farm.
- Farm?

70
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:51,041
I don't believe it to you.

71
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:54,337
Not leave that the clothes
deceive you, it is the true.

72
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:58,348
That is what you call him/her, truth.

73
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:01,586
- Good night.
- Merry Christmas.

74
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:03,379
For you also, I see you then.

75
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,196
If, I promise it to you, I leave now.

76
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:20,135
Him you, I sit down it, I am in elevator.

77
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:23,999
In 25 minutes maximum.

78
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,310
Don't I listen to you, what?

79
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:29,715
Lorraine, don't I listen to you, hello?

80
00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:32,308
This is not true, it cannot be.

81
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:48,951
Oh, God that I will make myself.

82
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,467
To leave the car, that is it I will make.

83
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,212
Hello.

84
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:48,311
Jesús.

85
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:51,012
Lucky that you make?

86
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:55,119
Sit down, we go, sit down.

87
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:57,652
- I sit down that.
- This well.

88
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:01,429
The door of the elevator can open up.

89
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:03,431
My car doesn't light and
I should leave to take a taxi.

90
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:05,567
If, I can... 

91
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:08,239
Alone I have to find my keys.

92
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:12,534
Where are they? He/she already went to
to give a turn so... 

93
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:14,472
- Ok.
- What do I pass to their car?

94
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:18,278
- Not I have idea.
- Insurance accent the lit lights.

95
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:21,175
I don't believe it, I am very good with that.

96
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:23,452
People make it the whole time.

97
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:25,385
It is the instinct, I eat here it is very dark.

98
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:27,853
That happens, here they are.

99
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,056
Well.

100
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:31,660
In fact I believe to have
a loader there behind.

101
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:34,559
So if it is their battery, it could use it.

102
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:39,566
Thank you, but he/she should take
a taxi, is so late already.

103
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:42,899
No, he/she took him/her but to take
a taxi, is Christmas.

104
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:47,175
Not you, like want, like want.

105
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:51,215
- How much did he/she take?
- Some minutes.

106
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:04,627
Well, where this their car?

107
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:06,659
Over there.

108
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:12,937
Working late,
no? You like he/she feels.

109
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:18,770
These cars are very
sure almost always.

110
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:20,578
That believes.

111
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:25,549
Well, positive.

112
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,177
Negative.

113
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:34,686
Ok, be about lighting it.

114
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:39,487
That strange.

115
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:42,493
Wait, he/she can light the lights.

116
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:48,369
Try again with the keys.

117
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:50,999
Shit.

118
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:52,971
Turn off the lights.

119
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,072
You know that, this well.

120
00:11:57,416 --> 00:12:00,078
You have been of a lot of help, but I surrender.

121
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:01,719
I sit down it but not you that it passes him/her.

122
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:04,055
I thought that he/she could make something with the one.

123
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:08,020
This well, it has been very
good, it takes me to the elevator.

124
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:09,658
Alone it was about helping her.

125
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:14,124
Him you, I appreciate it, thank you.

126
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:25,567
You that this brave one with
their car that he/she doesn't light.

127
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,673
But they are Christmas,
it is hour of feeling well.

128
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:32,442
If, you are right, he should be.

129
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,789
Me... 

130
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:46,660
Let us get ready a small one
eat of Christmas for my.

131
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:50,467
If you want you could eat with me.

132
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:57,872
- Alone he/she joked.
- If, I sit down it, I am tired.

133
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:00,509
But seriously, thank you for the help.

134
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,604
Of anything, maybe in another moment.

135
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:05,908
If, clear.

136
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,548
Well he/she takes.

137
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:11,116
Sure that doesn't want
that he/she calls him/her a taxi.

138
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:12,915
If I have a number here.

139
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,422
Ok, like Merry Christmas want.

140
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,322
Merry Christmas.

141
00:13:57,469 --> 00:14:00,529
It can send me a car
at the 2237 of Park Avenue?

142
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:05,310
This sure one? No, this
well, I will wait, thank you.

143
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:19,516
Hey, Lorraine, not
you will believe what I spend.

144
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:22,450
No, in fact my car didn't light.

145
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:28,326
It begins without my, I will arrive in
one hour and I will compensate them to him.

146
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:32,329
Ok, I see them soon, good-bye.

147
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:31,523
Ok, thank you.

148
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,470
This not this happening.

149
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:52,749
No, no, it cannot be.

150
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:56,585
Carl, where these? Is somebody here?

151
00:15:58,157 --> 00:15:59,954
We go, we go.

152
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,295
What... ?

153
00:16:10,936 --> 00:16:13,632
Alone one second, I already return.

154
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:35,320
Hello, do they listen to me?

155
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:39,825
There is a taxi waiting for me, me
he/she can open the door of in front.

156
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:42,227
Hello?

157
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:46,568
No, no, not.

158
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:52,169
Demons, how do I leave myself here?

159
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,648
Without service.

160
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:02,511
Awake, curse the taxi left.

161
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:27,407
Hey, I am still here, wait.

162
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:43,657
I magnify.

163
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:05,609
Hello?

164
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:10,252
Ok, leaves the paranoia.

165
00:18:13,892 --> 00:18:16,122
You go to the office.

166
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:58,029
Hello?

167
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:43,371
Merry Christmas, you have been a good girl.

168
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:52,580
Ok, this well, these well.

169
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:57,419
You are not very well, these
well? Take it calmly.

170
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,080
This well.

171
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:05,526
What do I spend that hour is?

172
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:08,021
Alone you fell, you will be well.

173
00:21:10,135 --> 00:21:11,932
I don't feel well, I will vomit.

174
00:21:13,071 --> 00:21:15,130
I go for some water, dilutes.

175
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:19,833
Be careful.

176
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:21,043
You will injure.

177
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:22,677
It is about calming down.

178
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:26,347
Ok.

179
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:30,546
This well, takes, he/she takes.

180
00:21:32,357 --> 00:21:36,760
Well, I will help you, ok, I will help you.

181
00:21:38,764 --> 00:21:42,200
We go.

182
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:45,666
Well, here we go.

183
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,804
It is about relaxing yourself, I will clean this.

184
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:52,900
Ok.

185
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:14,957
Well, I already return.

186
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:29,541
Are you hungry?

187
00:22:30,882 --> 00:22:34,045
I have turkey, mashed potatoes.

188
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:37,546
I also have something of bread of corn.

189
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:43,655
Oh, I sit down this.

190
00:22:44,496 --> 00:22:47,465
Alone it was playing,
he/she didn't want to get scared.

191
00:22:52,504 --> 00:22:54,995
I wait that still this hot one.

192
00:22:58,977 --> 00:23:00,911
The taenia in the microwave so... 

193
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:05,243
Do you feel better?

194
00:23:07,452 --> 00:23:09,249
What do I pass to my clothes?

195
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:14,451
As I told you, you fell
and your clothes got dirty.

196
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:23,223
Maybe, want something of wine.

197
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:26,028
So that you relax yourself a little.

198
00:23:26,938 --> 00:23:29,429
Not you that devils faces,
but better you loose me.

199
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:40,451
This wine is of
California, of where I am me.

200
00:23:41,386 --> 00:23:43,047
It is very pretty there.

201
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:48,157
Of where you are?

202
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,257
What do you want?

203
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:55,864
Do I want to know of where you are?

204
00:23:57,969 --> 00:24:00,199
I Am of Rainfield.

205
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,740
Where this that?

206
00:24:04,409 --> 00:24:06,001
Why don't you tell me what you want?

207
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:10,509
Alone I want to know where this that.

208
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:12,713
And I want you to relax yourself.

209
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:30,929
Health.

210
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:34,364
Well, I will make the toast.

211
00:24:34,873 --> 00:24:39,242
For the good friends,
the towns of where we are.

212
00:24:39,744 --> 00:24:41,939
And for Rainfield, where
want him to be that.

213
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:48,246
- He/she listens... 
- Tom.

214
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:52,487
Tom, I have to arrive to a place.

215
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:55,885
I have things to make.

216
00:24:56,194 --> 00:24:58,059
If, him you.

217
00:24:58,864 --> 00:25:04,302
You worry too much, not
you need to go with that whole people.

218
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:11,307
Maybe we should take
something in the new year.

219
00:25:15,146 --> 00:25:18,707
Already prepare here everything, this.

220
00:25:19,217 --> 00:25:21,412
Him you, and and you go very well.

221
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,415
If, well.

222
00:25:23,655 --> 00:25:27,022
Because we eat, I am
dying from hunger.

223
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:29,318
Tom this is very pretty on your behalf.

224
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:32,326
But my family me this
waiting, I have plans.

225
00:25:32,564 --> 00:25:34,259
I imagine that some
plans should break.

226
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:40,434
Do you want to thank the or do I make it me?

227
00:25:44,175 --> 00:25:45,335
To the devil, olvidémonos of that.

228
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:48,444
I have never been so religious.

229
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:52,143
Good Appetite.

230
00:25:58,657 --> 00:26:00,090
What do you like to make?

231
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:06,930
You know, after the one
I work, your hobbies.

232
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:11,595
That is a mundane question, but
people the question to be known.

233
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:16,502
I read, now I am reading Hemingay.

234
00:26:17,108 --> 00:26:19,008
The sun comes out always.

235
00:26:21,813 --> 00:26:24,043
You should eat, it will cool.

236
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:29,618
In all ways, in the book this
man loves this girl so much.

237
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:35,216
That this willing one to forgive him/her
all that she makes.

238
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:38,054
Inclusive their infidelities.

239
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:44,827
It is a very intense history,
but is that the love, not?

240
00:26:51,242 --> 00:26:54,143
My boyfriend leaves to
to worry and he/she will come for my.

241
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:08,684
If I don't arrive, the one will come,
the one knows where I work.

242
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:17,298
Does he/she make as much as they leave or do they see each other?

243
00:27:18,503 --> 00:27:20,300
- 2 years.
- 2 years?

244
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:25,508
- Do they live together?
- He/she is not interested.

245
00:27:28,613 --> 00:27:30,444
That was not very educated.

246
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:35,013
If, we live together, ok.

247
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:41,617
2 years.

248
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:45,321
It is but that a boyfriend, that is... 

249
00:27:46,731 --> 00:27:48,562
 ... it is as a marriage.

250
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:51,563
- Do they have plans?
- If.

251
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:55,033
How ago your boyfriend?

252
00:27:56,541 --> 00:27:57,667
He is a journalist.

253
00:27:57,942 --> 00:28:00,467
Journalist? Wise that
it should be intelligent.

254
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,010
- What journalist's type?
- Deport.

255
00:28:02,213 --> 00:28:03,703
Do deport? In a newspaper?

256
00:28:03,915 --> 00:28:05,780
- In the One Post.
- The Post? I read it.

257
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:07,984
- How does he/she call himself?
- Mark Clayton.

258
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:11,882
Mark Clayton, Clayton? I don't remember.

259
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:16,483
I have one here.

260
00:28:16,795 --> 00:28:19,628
It is in the Internet, it is the one Post online.

261
00:28:29,908 --> 00:28:32,536
You know it is impressive that
you can maintain a relationship,

262
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:34,608
 ... with the quantity
of hours that you work.

263
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:39,112
He/she should feel very alone when
do you have to work, not?

264
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:45,920
Do you love him, the he/she loves you?

265
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:55,866
Alone I ask myself to you then
it worries how express he/she will come here.

266
00:28:58,136 --> 00:28:59,865
I am sure that already this in road.

267
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:05,967
Well.

268
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:08,972
He/she should walk on the way to half.

269
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,273
- What car does it manage?
- Not you.

270
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:13,677
Not you know, you don't know the one
car that your boyfriend manages.

271
00:29:13,885 --> 00:29:15,477
- A Toyota, I believe... 
- Toyota?

272
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:20,285
If, the car but quick, he/she can
to arrive but quick of what believed.

273
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:23,823
He/she can come right now for the ramp.

274
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:38,042
You know, you have not spoken a lot,
since we met each other.

275
00:29:40,345 --> 00:29:42,813
But now,

276
00:29:43,348 --> 00:29:47,478
 ... you tell me all envelope your boyfriend.

277
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:49,111
I sit down it, your engaged one.

278
00:29:50,855 --> 00:29:54,347
Or we become
better friends in the dinner,

279
00:29:54,726 --> 00:29:56,455
 ... or me these lying?

280
00:29:57,662 --> 00:30:00,825
Allow me to guess, you lie me.

281
00:30:06,171 --> 00:30:07,934
Don't you really have a boyfriend, not?

282
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,940
But you want one,

283
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:16,674
 ... you want somebody
that he/she worries about you.

284
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:19,641
That he/she worries about you.

285
00:30:19,951 --> 00:30:21,578
Please, not.

286
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:25,354
You have a good family,

287
00:30:26,057 --> 00:30:29,549
 ... you have Lorraine.

288
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:33,360
Small Jimmy, Rose, they love you.

289
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:38,269
Insurance is worried by you.

290
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,469
Maybe we should call them.

291
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:46,174
To tell them that these well.

292
00:30:48,112 --> 00:30:49,579
What do you believe?

293
00:31:04,729 --> 00:31:06,424
What do we tell him/her?

294
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:11,661
Already you, already you, we tell him/her
that you have other plans.

295
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:14,835
No, sure you already said that.

296
00:31:15,974 --> 00:31:20,673
You know that, your he/she thinks of something,
you are a good liar.

297
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:27,177
We go, he/she calls.

298
00:31:28,686 --> 00:31:30,051
No.

299
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:46,061
Hello, hello?

300
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:50,601
Hello Rosie, put on to
your mommy in the telephone.

301
00:31:50,975 --> 00:31:52,567
Who does speak?

302
00:31:53,011 --> 00:31:54,979
He/she is the aunt Angi.

303
00:31:55,513 --> 00:31:59,074
- He/she suckles he/she is the aunt Angi.
- Give me one second.

304
00:31:59,984 --> 00:32:02,817
Hey, where these? Angela?

305
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:05,018
I don't feel well.

306
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:07,620
What do you say? We are waiting for you.

307
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:11,151
- He/she says that it doesn't feel well.
- That said the last time.

308
00:32:11,362 --> 00:32:13,227
Can I speak with my sister, please?

309
00:32:13,831 --> 00:32:15,128
Where these Angi?

310
00:32:18,169 --> 00:32:20,034
Angela?

311
00:32:20,538 --> 00:32:23,336
At home, I came home.

312
00:32:23,741 --> 00:32:26,642
- What does it happen, where this?
- Not I understand.

313
00:32:26,844 --> 00:32:28,744
When he/she speaks with you, me
you said that you were in road.

314
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:30,741
And the disguises?

315
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,975
We should eat, already
you know your sister.

316
00:32:34,252 --> 00:32:37,153
Angela, serious good that put
to your family first at some time.

317
00:32:37,355 --> 00:32:39,585
Coarse, give me the telephone.

318
00:32:39,857 --> 00:32:41,290
Angi that happens?

319
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:46,958
Hello? Don't I listen to it, hello?

320
00:32:47,265 --> 00:32:48,994
Affection, do you listen to me?

321
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:50,894
Hello he/she suckles, I am here.

322
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:52,898
Affections, what step where these?

323
00:32:53,671 --> 00:32:58,005
Not him you, I believe that it is cold.

324
00:32:58,676 --> 00:33:01,304
You really listen to yourself
horrible, sure this well?

325
00:33:02,213 --> 00:33:05,341
- Affection.
- If.

326
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:08,251
Alone I need to rest.

327
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:14,257
Ok, rests and I hope you sit down
better for the lunch tomorrow.

328
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:17,317
And affection, don't worry
for the disguises, ok?

329
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:21,030
Merry Christmas, Ángel, I love you.

330
00:33:21,466 --> 00:33:22,933
I love you, he/she suckles.

331
00:33:34,545 --> 00:33:37,446
That is the best gift of
Christmas that somebody has given me.

332
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,949
Thank you.

333
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:44,482
Now I have a present for you.

334
00:34:07,612 --> 00:34:10,547
We go, open it.

335
00:34:14,852 --> 00:34:17,150
Not you do have curiosity?

336
00:34:18,022 --> 00:34:19,956
We go, open it.

337
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,326
If, if, if.

338
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,230
To that now if you have curiosity, not?

339
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:40,840
I won't torture you.

340
00:34:46,184 --> 00:34:48,652
What? This well.

341
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:55,657
Why do you teach me this?

342
00:34:55,893 --> 00:34:57,360
He/she waits.

343
00:35:24,355 --> 00:35:26,823
Damned idiot.

344
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:32,762
I set that you had to see that.

345
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:39,928
Do you want to go of walk?

346
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:50,439
The men always
they make what you/they want.

347
00:35:57,288 --> 00:35:58,653
Here we go.

348
00:36:03,227 --> 00:36:05,593
Calm down, sit down.

349
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:18,899
Why did you make that?

350
00:36:23,915 --> 00:36:25,507
Be quiet.

351
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:30,911
- Allow me to help you.
- No.

352
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:32,919
Not be silly, I won't hurt you.

353
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:35,151
You hurt my arm.

354
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,327
That is because you don't give it to me.

355
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:42,965
Alone you allow me to go.

356
00:36:43,734 --> 00:36:44,632
I won't tell to anybody.

357
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:47,463
If, I believe you, alone I want to become trained something.

358
00:37:05,423 --> 00:37:07,084
Olvidémonos of all that.

359
00:37:09,193 --> 00:37:11,093
Here we go.

360
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:28,910
I believe that he/she takes too much wine.

361
00:37:30,548 --> 00:37:32,311
Not it should manage.

362
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:36,709
Alone he/she joked.

363
00:37:42,226 --> 00:37:44,922
I have seen you manage so many times.

364
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:47,254
It feels strange to be
in the car with you.

365
00:37:49,634 --> 00:37:51,067
In fact it is I magnify.

366
00:37:51,836 --> 00:37:53,736
I thought that we will give a turn.

367
00:37:54,038 --> 00:37:55,232
If.

368
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,965
Then for that are lowering Tom?

369
00:37:58,876 --> 00:38:00,776
It is cold there out.

370
00:38:01,512 --> 00:38:04,777
This will be better.

371
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:16,890
What do we make here?

372
00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:42,214
Oh my God.

373
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,255
What is this Tom?

374
00:38:46,223 --> 00:38:47,918
This is my gift for you.

375
00:38:58,636 --> 00:39:01,799
He/she takes this and teach him/her.

376
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:05,672
To teach him/her what?

377
00:39:06,877 --> 00:39:08,674
That you are not a prostitute.

378
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:12,881
He/she takes this and teach him/her that he/she is not able to
to play each woman that wants.

379
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,111
Languages of what I pass in the elevator?

380
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:22,389
Oh, Tom, you don't understand, that was an error.

381
00:39:23,127 --> 00:39:24,424
A stupid error.

382
00:39:24,729 --> 00:39:25,889
What, what?

383
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:27,188
Treatment of violating you.

384
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:30,295
No, alone you passes a little in a party.

385
00:39:30,501 --> 00:39:31,695
Not it was anything of violation.

386
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:35,138
Alone it was drunk, you excuses.

387
00:39:37,007 --> 00:39:38,634
Him you excuses.

388
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:41,401
You believe that you are first o'clock
to the one that makes him/her this?

389
00:39:41,812 --> 00:39:44,212
I have seen it be about playing to
all the women in the building.

390
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:46,940
It is or pervert, is a degenerate one.

391
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:48,617
No, it is not it.

392
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:53,017
He/she is a good man, a
good man, looks at it.

393
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:54,723
He has a family, a wife.

394
00:39:54,925 --> 00:39:56,222
Tom please.

395
00:39:56,527 --> 00:39:59,052
He/she stops to say my name.

396
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:00,822
You what you are about making.

397
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:03,857
You are to humanize yourself
as if you were one it kills.

398
00:40:04,135 --> 00:40:05,932
I told it to you, I won't injure.

399
00:40:06,937 --> 00:40:08,962
Well? He/she stops to tell me my name.

400
00:40:09,273 --> 00:40:11,537
He/she stops to say, Tom, Tom, Tom.

401
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:14,040
Every time that you speak.

402
00:40:24,555 --> 00:40:26,750
You that you are a person, him you.

403
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:29,649
I am also it.

404
00:40:30,461 --> 00:40:31,985
You that you have feelings.

405
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:33,662
Me also.

406
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:36,690
I worry about your feelings.

407
00:40:37,968 --> 00:40:40,095
He is the one that you should fear him/her.

408
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:42,999
He is the one that doesn't have feelings.

409
00:40:43,808 --> 00:40:46,276
If you want to help him.

410
00:40:47,978 --> 00:40:50,776
He/she takes this and teach him/her.

411
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:59,587
I told you that you excuses.

412
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:03,252
Him you excuses but he/she will make it again.

413
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:04,758
And he/she apologized again.

414
00:41:05,029 --> 00:41:07,327
You should avoid that these
idiots take advantage of you.

415
00:41:07,731 --> 00:41:08,857
Tom... 

416
00:41:09,733 --> 00:41:12,634
Please, believe me it was
alone a malentendido, Tom

417
00:41:12,937 --> 00:41:16,964
He/she stops to say my name, I told it to you.

418
00:41:17,842 --> 00:41:21,539
- Didn't I tell it to you?
- If, if, if.

419
00:41:22,346 --> 00:41:23,779
I sit down it but me these scaring.

420
00:41:24,048 --> 00:41:26,141
Jesús, when will you understand?

421
00:41:28,552 --> 00:41:30,452
I am here to help you.

422
00:41:30,754 --> 00:41:32,187
I won't injure.

423
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:47,366
Ok.

424
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:52,467
I will make it.

425
00:41:54,311 --> 00:41:56,006
You loose me and I will make it.

426
00:42:02,953 --> 00:42:05,513
No, no, not.

427
00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:08,316
You are a good person.

428
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:11,126
Your also.

429
00:42:11,428 --> 00:42:13,862
I should never request you
to make this, I sit down it.

430
00:42:14,231 --> 00:42:16,131
No, this well.

431
00:42:17,234 --> 00:42:19,828
Because I want, alone... 

432
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:23,363
Alone you have to loosen
and I will make it for you.

433
00:42:34,151 --> 00:42:35,948
No, no, no, it is my work... 

434
00:42:36,253 --> 00:42:38,483
No, Tom listens to me, it is not it, not.

435
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:40,054
Please, don't make anything.

436
00:42:40,691 --> 00:42:42,488
Not be about escaping, ok?

437
00:42:43,861 --> 00:42:45,692
Do I trust you?

438
00:42:46,864 --> 00:42:48,491
Do I trust you?

439
00:42:48,766 --> 00:42:51,599
If, you can trust my.

440
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:57,165
I sit down it.

441
00:42:58,375 --> 00:43:00,172
I sit down it.

442
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:08,010
Then you like
to play the girls, not?

443
00:43:09,019 --> 00:43:10,919
No, no, not?

444
00:43:11,155 --> 00:43:13,316
You look at it, I said that you looked at it.

445
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:18,327
Do you find that her this happy one?

446
00:43:22,132 --> 00:43:25,761
If, you entered with the mistaken girl.

447
00:43:29,073 --> 00:43:30,973
What did he/she make you think that it was for you?

448
00:43:32,142 --> 00:43:33,837
What did he/she give you the right?

449
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:37,641
It belongs to another person, you know it.

450
00:43:37,848 --> 00:43:41,944
Pretensioso, shit piece.

451
00:43:43,654 --> 00:43:46,452
Not you know to the world, neither to all in the one.

452
00:43:46,757 --> 00:43:49,157
In that thinks a type like
your when it puts the hands,

453
00:43:49,393 --> 00:43:51,452
 ... in a girl to the one who
obviously it doesn't interest him/her?

454
00:43:51,762 --> 00:43:53,662
Who obviously is not a prostitute.

455
00:43:56,066 --> 00:43:57,658
Now you do think different?

456
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:00,937
I don't listen to you well.

457
00:44:01,238 --> 00:44:04,401
What was what said?
You can speak but high.

458
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:07,902
Because of this you don't go
to leave apologizing.

459
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:11,440
Why I am wasting
my time with you?

460
00:44:11,915 --> 00:44:13,314
No.

461
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:15,612
Why Angela, the he/she deserves it?

462
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:17,719
Don't make him/her he/she please swims.

463
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:40,040
For.

464
00:44:59,063 --> 00:45:01,395
Merry Christmas, idiot.

465
00:45:17,815 --> 00:45:20,613
Good, it no longer bothered you but.

466
00:45:21,118 --> 00:45:24,519
To where we go? Not we can leave it there.

467
00:45:25,622 --> 00:45:27,021
Not we can.

468
00:45:27,257 --> 00:45:28,849
Why for that defend it?

469
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:31,621
I am not making it.

470
00:45:31,829 --> 00:45:33,262
Do you like it, do you like him to play you?

471
00:45:34,331 --> 00:45:36,128
Do you like when he/she plays you in the garage?

472
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:37,322
Do you want to go to bed here with the?

473
00:45:37,534 --> 00:45:38,933
Your you know that that is not true.

474
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:41,765
Then that it happens, is it for your career?

475
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:44,737
Did you go to bed with the one for a promotion?

476
00:45:48,278 --> 00:45:49,870
Leave it.

477
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:55,344
You are right, I sit down it, I sit down it.

478
00:45:57,454 --> 00:45:59,046
Not we should leave it here.

479
00:46:07,531 --> 00:46:08,395
What do you make?

480
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:09,896
We will take it to give a turn.

481
00:46:11,502 --> 00:46:12,730
What do you make?

482
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:15,200

00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:30,043
Oh, my God.

00:46:35,325 --> 00:46:37,156
Tom doesn't make it, not please.

487
00:46:39,229 --> 00:46:41,527
No, not.

488

Your you are a good person.

489
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:54,034
Please, don't make it, not.

490
00:46:57,147 --> 00:47:00,207
No, not.

491
00:47:07,891 --> 00:47:09,188
To where you go?

492
00:47:11,929 --> 00:47:14,625
Angela, returns.

493
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:18,229
Damned liar.

494
00:47:45,229 --> 00:47:47,254
Here below.

495
00:47:49,666 --> 00:47:51,429
Do they listen to me?

496
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:59,373
Does somebody listen to me?

497
00:49:22,392 --> 00:49:23,416
Shit!

498
00:49:29,933 --> 00:49:31,230
Good boy.

499
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:32,928
Good boy.

500
00:49:47,751 --> 00:49:51,517
Everything is well, I will take the suitcase.

501
00:50:51,515 --> 00:50:52,482
Help!

502
00:50:53,283 --> 00:50:54,773
Help, please!

503
00:50:55,485 --> 00:50:57,282
Help, please!

504

Please that somebody helps me!

505
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:12,669
Help me, somebody is about kill-me!

506
00:51:20,544 --> 00:51:21,340
Without service.

507
00:52:18,735 --> 00:52:20,225
Angela... 

508
00:52:21,238 --> 00:52:25,504
Please, if somebody can listen to me,
I am caught in the buried parking

509
00:52:25,542 --> 00:52:29,672
of the building in the 2370 of Ave. Park.

510
00:52:30,447 --> 00:52:32,039
Somebody is about murdering me.

511
00:52:35,385 --> 00:52:37,148
Angela, let us go!

512
00:52:38,054 --> 00:52:38,986
Shit!

513
00:52:39,689 --> 00:52:42,658
Angela... 

514
00:52:45,862 --> 00:52:47,762
Can we speak of this?

515
00:52:53,370 --> 00:52:55,201
It seems that somebody
it is about playing. Hey Roky?

516
00:53:04,414 --> 00:53:06,439
Angela?

517
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:09,212
Exit.

518
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:41,282
Elevators.

519
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:48,880
Please!

520
00:54:15,819 --> 00:54:18,344
Let us go, to the lobby, to the lobby!

521
00:54:19,623 --> 00:54:21,318
Why demons do you stop?

522
00:54:25,629 --> 00:54:26,960
Angela!

523
00:54:33,737 --> 00:54:34,829

526
00:55:14,044 --> 00:55:16,911
If, we speak to him/her of security, hello... 

527
00:55:19,916 --> 00:55:22,851
- Hello... 
- If, if, if, I am here can he/she listen to me?

528
00:55:22,952 --> 00:55:27,753

- I have been kidnapped, I work in the signature

529
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:30,691
Brighter Smith & Steinberg,
it is in the 2370 of Ave. Park.

530
00:55:30,727 --> 00:55:33,287
I am caught in the one
elevator, can he/she call at the 911?

531
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:36,493
OK, calm down this the one
kidnapper with you?

532
00:55:36,533 --> 00:55:40,902
No, the one is outside, in the parking,
it has already killed more somebody.

533
00:55:40,937 --> 00:55:43,906
- Did he/she see it making it?
- If, I have seen it.

534
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:46,374
He assists the area of
parking in my building.

535
00:55:46,443 --> 00:55:48,707
Please, if he/she could
to hurry, I am in danger.

536
00:55:48,745 --> 00:55:51,270
Sra. relax you and breathe deep.

537
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:55,011
How demons he/she wants that me
do relax? This man is about killing me.

538
00:55:55,051 --> 00:56:00,683
He/she could understand once and for all and to call
to the police? Please call at the 911!

539
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:09,598
To the police?, no, him
it is only about helping her.

540
00:56:11,301 --> 00:56:13,428
Correct?

541
00:56:13,503 --> 00:56:15,994
Angela!

542
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:19,898
Is Angela still there?

543
00:56:21,811 --> 00:56:27,647
Listen to me imbecile, I will look for
to the police and you leave to joder!

544
00:56:28,952 --> 00:56:33,912
I only want to speak to you Angela...  For
of seeking that you are another person.

545
00:56:33,957 --> 00:56:39,122
Not be bothersome. You could
to leave? He/she was joking.

546
00:56:39,162 --> 00:56:41,357
Veto to the hell!

547
00:56:41,431 --> 00:56:47,063
Angela, you don't understand it, I made it
for you. That type you irrespetó.

548
00:56:49,539 --> 00:56:51,734
Why don't you speak to me Angela?

549
00:56:53,176 --> 00:56:55,474
Only give me an opportunity.

550
00:56:57,547 --> 00:57:01,381
Perhaps if you give me that
opportunity this can work.

551
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:09,655
You have given me the idea. People that happens
for these situations they should be together.

552
00:57:09,692 --> 00:57:14,391
To depend the one of the other one.
Possibly they lean on mutually.

553
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:19,334
They take care mutually. To
times until they fall in love.

554
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:23,333
Angela.

555
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:28,008
Angela, please, don't make this... 

556
00:57:31,014 --> 00:57:32,845
Why don't you speak to me?!

557
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:41,720
Do you know? He/she would want you to feel a
little more than respect for yourself.

558
00:59:22,692 --> 00:59:24,990
Not I will leave! Did you hear me?

559
00:59:26,696 --> 00:59:29,688
I won't move, damned!

560
01:00:51,681 --> 01:00:52,511
Carl.

561
01:00:55,885 --> 01:00:57,079
Carl.

562
01:01:28,785 --> 01:01:30,377
Angela.

563
01:01:34,257 --> 01:01:37,158
Freezing you there out should be.

564
01:01:38,061 --> 01:01:39,653
Angela.

565
01:01:51,174 --> 01:01:52,766
That disaster!

566
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:00,342
Angela... 

567
01:02:02,118 --> 01:02:04,313
I believe that Carl is wounded.

568
01:02:06,022 --> 01:02:09,856
Angela. We would should
to call to an ambulance?

569
01:02:12,829 --> 01:02:17,528
He/she could return this way with their children
and their family, and your with your sisters.

570
01:02:18,167 --> 01:02:23,469
And I will stay here, in
this parking! me only!

571
01:02:23,539 --> 01:02:27,635
Because everybody
he/she makes what gives him/her the desire!

572
01:02:31,647 --> 01:02:33,444
Angela... 

573
01:02:39,155 --> 01:02:44,855
Not pursuing you will be
a lifetime. Also... 

574
01:02:46,596 --> 01:02:48,564
The whole place is closed.

575
01:02:52,168 --> 01:02:54,193
Angela?

576
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:58,172
Angela! What you go to
to make to escape?

577
01:02:59,408 --> 01:03:01,933
This freezing there out.

578
01:03:02,812 --> 01:03:04,803
Angela?

579
01:03:05,815 --> 01:03:07,407
Angela?

580
01:03:09,252 --> 01:03:10,913
Angela!

581
01:03:16,025 --> 01:03:17,822
Angela?!

582
01:03:18,661 --> 01:03:20,458
Angela?!

583
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:31,573
Where will you pass the navidad, Carl?

584
01:06:05,127 --> 01:06:06,594
Thank you.

585
01:06:34,457 --> 01:06:36,721
You are wonderful.

586
01:07:02,885 --> 01:07:04,614
Do you want make-up?

587
01:07:05,388 --> 01:07:08,084
Mmm? OK.

588
01:07:12,294 --> 01:07:18,494
You have the more lips
beautiful that has seen.

589
01:07:23,939 --> 01:07:26,931
Thank you to accept my invitation.

590
01:07:31,414 --> 01:07:41,016
It is your body...  it is so
good to be here, baby... 

591
01:07:44,026 --> 01:07:46,051
Your and me... 

592
01:07:46,862 --> 01:07:53,563
Angela your skin is...  it is...  so soft... 

593
01:07:58,974 --> 01:08:04,310
I want to love you and to love you... 
Does Angela know it, certain?

594
01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:28,432
Hello. Shit, shit!
Hello! Can you hear me?

595
01:08:33,909 --> 01:08:35,934
It is well.

596
01:09:02,471 --> 01:09:04,268
Hello Official, can I help him?

597
01:09:05,708 --> 01:09:08,006
He/she opens the entrance, please.

598
01:09:10,045 --> 01:09:12,275
If Sr. at once I am with you.

599
01:09:17,052 --> 01:09:20,215
I sit down it, I sit down it, I have to make it.

600
01:09:50,019 --> 01:09:53,955
I sit down it, but I delayed
a little for other matters.

601
01:09:59,562 --> 01:10:00,586
What is what happens?

602
01:10:00,629 --> 01:10:04,759
We receive a call for problems
of this address. Do you know something about that?

603
01:10:04,833 --> 01:10:07,028
No, it has been very calm tonight.

604
01:10:07,069 --> 01:10:10,095
Have not you noticed of anything suspect?

605
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:14,275
No, I have made my beats, and... 

606
01:10:14,343 --> 01:10:17,540
 ... it has been very calm,
I have not even had to lower.

607
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:19,207
There are cars here.

608
01:10:19,248 --> 01:10:22,115
Good, it is a parking.

609
01:10:24,353 --> 01:10:31,020
In this level they stay the cars, in
the following one is a rent agency... 

610
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:34,928
I mean that nobody has been for
here tonight, except me and Roky.

611
01:10:34,964 --> 01:10:36,864
They have made his here tonight.

612
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:39,493
Something like that, Roky is my dog.

613
01:10:39,568 --> 01:10:41,502
I have it right now in the office.

614
01:10:41,570 --> 01:10:44,698
We will take a look,
mount you, we will give you an aventón.

615
01:10:44,773 --> 01:10:46,707
It is a good idea.

616
01:10:48,010 --> 01:10:53,073
If, allow me to not close the door
will be that somebody is strained.

617
01:11:35,124 --> 01:11:37,149
OK, thank you for the aventón.

618
01:11:38,861 --> 01:11:41,830

the floors, follow right here,

619

621
01:12:38,187 --> 01:12:39,552
Not there is sign.

622
01:12:55,671 --> 01:12:58,469
What was what happened here?

623
01:13:43,352 --> 01:13:46,753
Help me! Help! Help!

624

You say that you have not seen
anything strange tonight?

627
01:14:35,337 --> 01:14:38,738
No, everybody was early.

628
01:14:38,774 --> 01:14:41,174
Do you have a party there inside?

629
01:14:41,243 --> 01:14:44,041
No, we are only Roky and
me, there is not any party.

630
01:14:48,450 --> 01:14:52,113
Nobody has come to visit one another,
do you already know, for some action?

631
01:14:52,154 --> 01:14:55,954
To my? No, not. What company
would he/she have if nobody has lowered here?

632
01:14:55,991 --> 01:14:58,084
Especially at these hours.

633
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:01,994
Don't you like to break the rules, certain?

634
01:15:02,030 --> 01:15:06,592
- No, I only make my work.
- Of agreement, vámonos.

635
01:15:09,905 --> 01:15:11,202
Help me!

636
01:15:15,911 --> 01:15:18,641
I have to open them the door,
so I will take the stairways.

637
01:15:18,714 --> 01:15:20,204
Make it.

638
01:15:40,168 --> 01:15:41,533
Open up!

639
01:15:58,153 --> 01:16:01,680
Wait!

640
01:16:09,932 --> 01:16:11,661
That they pass it well.

641
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:15,295
