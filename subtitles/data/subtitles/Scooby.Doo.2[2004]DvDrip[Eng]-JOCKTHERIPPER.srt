<i>Here we are, folks,</i>
<i>on the red carpet at the grand opening...</i>

00:02:05,483 --> 00:02:07,523
<i>... of the Coolsonian Criminology Museum.</i>

3
00:02:07,691 --> 00:02:10,561
<i>Tonight's premiere exhibit</i>
<i>is a rousing look back...</i>

4
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:13,316
<i>... at the exploits of Mystery Incorporated.</i>

5
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:16,042
<i>And here they are.</i>

6
00:02:20,747 --> 00:02:25,155
Folks, this crowd is going crazy
over Mystery Inc.

7
00:02:26,411 --> 00:02:27,621
Here you go, girls.

8
00:02:28,075 --> 00:02:31,239
I got an ascot for each of you.

9
00:02:32,971 --> 00:02:34,247
Hello!

10
00:02:34,667 --> 00:02:39,402
Check it out! It's a Shag and Scoob quake
and the whole city's shaking!

11
00:02:39,563 --> 00:02:40,512
Yeah!

12
00:02:42,315 --> 00:02:43,776
Come on, Scoob.

13
00:02:48,939 --> 00:02:50,019
Sorry.

14
00:02:50,187 --> 00:02:52,806
I consider it a privilege, sir.

15
00:02:53,003 --> 00:02:56,483
- Daphne!
- Don't you two look beautiful. Thank you.

16
00:02:56,651 --> 00:02:59,848
Daphne! Daphne! Daphne!

17
00:03:00,331 --> 00:03:05,568
Hi! We love you!
We have you tattooed on our chests! Look!

18
00:03:06,859 --> 00:03:08,964
That's very sweet.

19
00:03:09,771 --> 00:03:11,364
Velma! Velma!

20
00:03:17,515 --> 00:03:20,549
- Sign it, please.
- We love you, Velma.

21
00:03:20,715 --> 00:03:21,827
Thanks.

22
00:03:21,995 --> 00:03:25,094
- I love her so much.
- May I have a word...

23
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:27,942
...with Coolsville's hottest detectives?
- Absolutely.

24
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:30,595
That's your word.
Come on, dear. We're late.

25
00:03:30,763 --> 00:03:32,967
Heather Jasper-Howe
at the grand opening...

26
00:03:33,131 --> 00:03:35,433
...of the new Coolsonian
Criminology Museum...

27
00:03:35,595 --> 00:03:39,425
...with our guests of honor, the master
detectives of Mystery Incorporated.

28
00:03:41,451 --> 00:03:42,760
Shaggy!

29
00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:46,851
Right on!

30
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:49,026
Hello! Hello!

31
00:03:59,115 --> 00:04:03,305
With all your success, will you still
have time for us in little old Coolsville?

32
00:04:03,467 --> 00:04:06,882
Of course little old Coolsville
can solve its problems without us...

33
00:04:07,051 --> 00:04:09,189
...but we'll always be here to help.

34
00:04:09,355 --> 00:04:12,203
The people of Coolsville
are the best in the world!

35
00:04:19,531 --> 00:04:23,208
- Can you tell us a little about the exhibit?
- Absolutely.

36
00:04:23,371 --> 00:04:28,073
Mystery Inc. is proud to donate
the costumes of criminals we've unmasked.

37
00:04:28,427 --> 00:04:32,321
- Like The Black Knight Ghost.
- Our very first case.

38
00:04:32,491 --> 00:04:34,728
The 10,000 Volt Ghost.

39
00:04:35,915 --> 00:04:40,355
The Skeleton Men,
and even the dreaded Pterodactyl Ghost.

40
00:04:42,283 --> 00:04:46,276
We've also donated the costumes
of some of our more ridiculous foes.

41
00:04:46,443 --> 00:04:47,785
Like Chickenstein.

42
00:04:47,947 --> 00:04:50,369
Can we get a shot of you
next to The Black Night?

43
00:04:50,539 --> 00:04:54,117
Ridiculous? Obviously she forgot
that dude tried to pluck us.

44
00:04:54,283 --> 00:04:57,731
- Remember what I told you?
- Never pick your nose in public?

45
00:04:57,899 --> 00:04:59,754
No, but that's good too.

46
00:04:59,915 --> 00:05:02,849
- Image is everything.
- Yes! lmage is everything.

47
00:05:03,019 --> 00:05:06,368
The whole city's watching,
so try and keep a brave face.

48
00:05:07,499 --> 00:05:10,368
- They're costumes.
- Right.

49
00:05:12,299 --> 00:05:17,001
She's right, Scoob.
Up close, they look totally fake.

50
00:05:19,915 --> 00:05:24,649
The Tar Monster scared the locals
of Byzantius away to take their treasure.

51
00:05:24,939 --> 00:05:29,162
But on the positive side,
he'd pave your driveway for free.

52
00:05:29,643 --> 00:05:31,367
Isn't that right, Velma?

53
00:05:32,683 --> 00:05:33,796
Velma?

54
00:05:59,339 --> 00:06:01,957
- Hi.
- Hi.

55
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:06,560
Daphne, this is Patrick Wisely.

56
00:06:06,731 --> 00:06:10,408
He's the curator here at the museum.

57
00:06:10,571 --> 00:06:12,393
It's very nice to meet you, Patrick.

58
00:06:12,554 --> 00:06:16,711
I hope you'll be working closely with Velma
on this ever-expanding exhibit.

59
00:06:18,283 --> 00:06:21,544
I know that you're a glamorous,
mysterious, jet-set adventurer...

60
00:06:21,707 --> 00:06:24,390
...preoccupied with
international intrigue and all...

61
00:06:24,555 --> 00:06:28,483
- Yes. That's me.
- I know, but...

62
00:06:29,323 --> 00:06:33,895
There's a symposium coming up
on syntactic reasoning in the criminal brain...

63
00:06:34,347 --> 00:06:37,161
I have always found
a criminal's inclination...

64
00:06:37,323 --> 00:06:41,763
...to incorrectly use the interrogative
pronoun in place of the relative...

65
00:06:41,931 --> 00:06:43,425
...delightfully absurd.

66
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:47,176
- Me too!
- Really?

67
00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:49,575
So maybe you'd want to go together?

68
00:06:50,763 --> 00:06:52,551
Suppose you mean like...

69
00:06:53,451 --> 00:06:54,880
Like a...

70
00:06:55,402 --> 00:06:57,791
Like a date. With me.

71
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:00,713
No, I can't, Patrick.

72
00:07:02,635 --> 00:07:05,984
Mystery is my mistress.
I must heed her sweet call.

73
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:07,687
Okay.

74
00:07:30,603 --> 00:07:32,490
What's happening?

75
00:07:45,387 --> 00:07:46,597
Oh, boy.

76
00:07:49,674 --> 00:07:51,016
Daphne!

77
00:07:51,178 --> 00:07:53,480
Go, Ned! Get it! Get it!

78
00:08:00,651 --> 00:08:04,513
- We need to come up with a plan.
- Hiding is our plan.

79
00:08:04,715 --> 00:08:08,490
In case you haven't noticed, there's
an unidentified freaky object in here!

80
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:12,327
- The curtains!
- We're on them!

81
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:17,993
- Come on, you chickens! Grab those ropes!
- But chickens aren't good with ropes!

82
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:23,556
- We got him!
- Shaggy, use the ropes to tie him up!

83
00:08:23,755 --> 00:08:26,854
It's just a costume!
It's just a costume!

84
00:08:27,435 --> 00:08:28,547
It's just a costume!

85
00:08:29,419 --> 00:08:30,946
We tied it! Let go!

86
00:08:49,163 --> 00:08:50,177
Sorry!

87
00:08:50,346 --> 00:08:52,932
- We have to save Shaggy and Scooby!
- As usual!

88
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:04,356
Fire!

89
00:09:09,995 --> 00:09:13,443
Mystery Incorporated.

90
00:09:16,682 --> 00:09:20,512
This is only the first rung
on the ladder of your demise.

91
00:09:20,683 --> 00:09:21,762
Look out!

92
00:09:29,195 --> 00:09:33,319
And this time,
you'll be the ones unmasked...

93
00:09:33,675 --> 00:09:36,806
...as the buffoons you truly are!

94
00:09:47,658 --> 00:09:51,717
Any clues to the cause of the attack?
How did the dinosaur get through security?

95
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:53,923
Where did Mystery Inc.'s plan go wrong?

96
00:09:54,091 --> 00:09:57,157
You. Any leads on the identity
of the masked man?

97
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:05,570
A secret hatch!

98
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:09,571
The real Pterodactyl Ghost
must have come through here!

99
00:10:16,011 --> 00:10:18,149
A reptilian scale.

100
00:10:18,603 --> 00:10:21,024
A most wonderful clue.

101
00:10:21,194 --> 00:10:25,831
He stole two costumes: The Black Knight
Ghost and The 10,000 Volt Ghost. Why?

102
00:10:25,994 --> 00:10:29,256
Fred, Daphne. Could you answer
a few questions for the press?

103
00:10:30,315 --> 00:10:33,315
Fred, I don't think
that's a really good idea.

104
00:10:33,482 --> 00:10:36,963
We always face the press
after we've unmasked the creeps.

105
00:10:37,131 --> 00:10:38,953
We looked ridiculous back there.

106
00:10:39,115 --> 00:10:42,727
Don't worry about it, sweetheart.
The press loves us.

107
00:10:50,154 --> 00:10:52,871
<i>The higher the pedestal,</i>
<i>the harder the fall.</i>

108
00:10:53,034 --> 00:10:56,831
<i>And Mystery Inc. fell far</i>
<i>in the embarrassing debacle...</i>

109
00:10:57,003 --> 00:10:59,720
<i>... that tarnished the reputation</i>
<i>of the once-great gang.</i>

110
00:10:59,883 --> 00:11:03,625
<i>It was an utter disaster</i>
<i>as two of the gang's key members...</i>

111
00:11:03,786 --> 00:11:06,601
<i>... Norville "Shaggy" Rogers</i>
<i>and Scoobert "Scooby-Doo"...</i>

112
00:11:06,763 --> 00:11:10,473
<i>... caused untold damage to Coolsville's</i>
<i>hottest new tourist attraction...</i>

113
00:11:10,635 --> 00:11:13,253
<i>... which took a full two years to complete.</i>

114
00:11:13,419 --> 00:11:17,696
<i>When asked for comment, Fred Jones,</i>
<i>leader of Mystery Inc., said this:</i>

115
00:11:17,867 --> 00:11:20,420
<i>Coolsville can solve its</i>
<i>problems without us.</i>

116
00:11:20,587 --> 00:11:22,921
I didn't say that! I mean...

117
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:25,472
I did, but that's out of context!

118
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:29,188
<i>This is Heather Jasper-Howe,</i>
<i>disillusioned from Coolsville.</i>

119
00:11:32,746 --> 00:11:34,634
It's all my fault.

120
00:11:35,595 --> 00:11:38,464
I'm the one who told Shaggy
and Scooby to get the ropes.

121
00:11:38,954 --> 00:11:43,177
No, Velma, it's my fault. I should have
checked that they were tied before I let go.

122
00:11:43,339 --> 00:11:44,997
It's my fault too.

123
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:47,396
We all know how Shaggy
and Scooby can be.

124
00:11:47,883 --> 00:11:48,831
But it's all right.

125
00:11:49,003 --> 00:11:52,615
We just need to stay strong,
in control, and work fast.

126
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:54,983
Come on, gang. Let's get to the lab.

127
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:58,278
We'll figure a way out
of this Jurassic jumble.

128
00:12:01,835 --> 00:12:03,079
Shaggy?

129
00:12:04,074 --> 00:12:06,496
- We're screwups.
- Yeah.

130
00:12:06,667 --> 00:12:10,627
I guess, looking back, every time they
made a plan, we did screw it up somehow.

131
00:12:10,794 --> 00:12:12,933
- I just never noticed before.
- Me neither.

132
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:17,190
There's gotta be some way we can prove
that we actually belong in the gang.

133
00:12:17,674 --> 00:12:20,708
We've gotta do something
totally unlike us.

134
00:12:21,067 --> 00:12:22,659
You know, Scoob...

135
00:12:23,114 --> 00:12:25,634
...we could act like real detectives!

136
00:12:28,586 --> 00:12:29,535
Really?

137
00:12:31,658 --> 00:12:36,360
Scooby-Doo, raise your right paw.
No, your right paw. Your other paw.

138
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:41,127
Repeat after me. From this day forward
we will no longer be our goofy selves.

139
00:12:43,082 --> 00:12:44,806
We will be awesome detectives.

140
00:12:45,995 --> 00:12:49,191
And we will act more like Fred
and Velma and Daphne.

141
00:12:49,354 --> 00:12:53,446
We will be terrific and fantastic
and spectacular...

142
00:12:53,611 --> 00:12:57,767
...and cease to be "loser-iffic,"
"lame-tastic" and "suck-tacular."

143
00:12:58,634 --> 00:13:00,489
Suck-tacular.

144
00:13:02,411 --> 00:13:05,280
Right, like, it's time to solve the mystery.

145
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:08,865
Let's kick this investigation up to an 11!

146
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:11,399
What the heck are you guys doing?

147
00:13:11,563 --> 00:13:13,984
We figured the first step
in solving a mystery...

148
00:13:14,154 --> 00:13:16,642
...would be to wear the right attire.

149
00:13:16,811 --> 00:13:19,942
I'm sorry, Daph,
but your go-go boots didn't fit...

150
00:13:20,682 --> 00:13:22,144
...me!

151
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:28,130
Scooby! Those so don't go
with that sweater!

152
00:13:28,298 --> 00:13:29,411
Really?

153
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,192
Clues!

154
00:13:36,363 --> 00:13:39,265
Alas, what are these strange markings?

155
00:13:41,834 --> 00:13:42,849
Words.

156
00:13:44,651 --> 00:13:45,992
Words!

157
00:13:46,411 --> 00:13:47,817
Scooby-Doo, take notes.

158
00:13:47,979 --> 00:13:50,434
- Gotcha.
- Come on, you kooks.

159
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:52,228
Okay.

160
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:55,842
It's come back positive.

161
00:13:56,011 --> 00:13:58,214
This is a real pterodactyl scale.

162
00:13:58,378 --> 00:13:59,327
Precisely!

163
00:13:59,499 --> 00:14:01,735
That masked figure
was out to humiliate us.

164
00:14:02,698 --> 00:14:05,032
Maybe it's someone we unmasked.

165
00:14:05,194 --> 00:14:09,089
But who would be able to make
a real Pterodactyl Ghost?

166
00:14:11,338 --> 00:14:13,410
The original Pterodactyl Ghost.

167
00:14:13,578 --> 00:14:15,040
Dr. Jonathan Jacobo.

168
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:16,487
That's right!

169
00:14:18,634 --> 00:14:22,562
<i>Jacobo wreaked havoc</i>
<i>in a statewide crime spree.</i>

170
00:14:24,938 --> 00:14:27,360
<i>Jacobo stole millions...</i>

171
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:31,873
<i>... which he used to finance his failed</i>
<i>experiments trying to create monsters.</i>

172
00:14:32,043 --> 00:14:34,792
Come alive! Come alive!

173
00:14:45,131 --> 00:14:47,236
<i>You think Jacobo's behind this?</i>

174
00:14:47,498 --> 00:14:51,077
<i>Impossible. Three years ago</i>
<i>he attempted a prison escape.</i>

175
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:03,367
So long, suckers!

176
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:08,673
Help me, suckers!

177
00:15:10,154 --> 00:15:12,488
His body was lost at sea.

178
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:16,928
How about this? Jacobo's cellmate
was released from prison two months ago.

179
00:15:17,098 --> 00:15:18,592
Jeremiah Wickles.

180
00:15:18,762 --> 00:15:22,559
The Black Knight Ghost. That was
one of the costumes that was stolen.

181
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:24,453
Right! And...

182
00:15:27,338 --> 00:15:29,672
Scooby-Doo! What's your conclusion?

183
00:15:30,378 --> 00:15:31,655
Bunny.

184
00:15:38,314 --> 00:15:41,478
<i>It seems Old Man Wickles deserves a visit...</i>

185
00:15:42,058 --> 00:15:45,157
<i>... before any of our other creepy conquests</i>
<i>make a comeback.</i>

186
00:15:45,322 --> 00:15:46,751
Freddy, up on the right.

187
00:15:46,923 --> 00:15:49,443
Old Man Wickles' ancestral manor.

188
00:15:52,235 --> 00:15:55,268
Oh, man. Another creepy crib!

189
00:15:55,723 --> 00:15:59,170
How come we can't ever investigate,
like, a KFC or something?

190
00:15:59,338 --> 00:16:00,287
Shaggy!

191
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:05,993
All right. Then again,
creepy is my middle name.

192
00:16:10,154 --> 00:16:11,234
Scoob!

193
00:16:14,698 --> 00:16:16,105
Come on, Scoob!

194
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:18,655
Looks like a bit of a fixer-upper.

195
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:23,392
Nice job last night. Losers!

196
00:16:24,074 --> 00:16:26,441
Quick, we need to think of a comeback.

197
00:16:26,602 --> 00:16:27,812
What dorks.

198
00:16:27,978 --> 00:16:30,051
Hey! Shut up!

199
00:16:31,914 --> 00:16:33,474
That's a good one.

200
00:16:34,475 --> 00:16:37,257
<i>You are trespassing on Wickles Manor.</i>

201
00:16:37,418 --> 00:16:41,247
- <i>Leave now or pay the price.</i>
- What jerk makes that his doorbell?

202
00:16:41,738 --> 00:16:42,687
Dude.

203
00:16:42,859 --> 00:16:44,866
He just said we'd pay the price.

204
00:16:45,035 --> 00:16:46,693
Shaggy, Shaggy, Shaggy.

205
00:16:46,858 --> 00:16:50,305
What could possibly happen
by ringing a doorbell?

206
00:17:04,682 --> 00:17:05,992
Help me!

207
00:17:07,018 --> 00:17:08,512
Shaggy!

208
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:17,319
I think I pulled something.

209
00:17:17,738 --> 00:17:21,087
That's what could happen
by ringing a doorbell, Fred. That!

210
00:17:21,258 --> 00:17:25,187
<i>At 7 p.m., the owner</i>
<i>will be home to set you free.</i>

211
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:28,832
You want to buy a box of cookies?

212
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:32,869
Excuse me.
Have you heard the Good News?

213
00:17:33,035 --> 00:17:35,238
Yeah. There's cookies!

214
00:17:35,434 --> 00:17:36,841
Watch the junk!

215
00:17:37,002 --> 00:17:38,049
Sorry.

216
00:17:38,218 --> 00:17:42,593
Oh, brother.
The lock's on a laser thumbprint scanner.

217
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:45,151
- Let me just get to my makeup.
- Daph, now?

218
00:17:45,322 --> 00:17:49,315
You know what, Velma? It's never too late
to learn to properly apply makeup.

219
00:17:49,482 --> 00:17:52,679
Okay. The last good thumbprint
should still be there, so...

220
00:17:52,843 --> 00:17:54,599
...a little blush...

221
00:17:55,082 --> 00:17:56,194
...a pore strip...

222
00:17:59,722 --> 00:18:01,129
...and voilà.

223
00:18:01,578 --> 00:18:02,691
All right, Daph!

224
00:18:02,922 --> 00:18:04,809
I enjoy being a girl.

225
00:18:09,194 --> 00:18:11,845
- Thank you!
- See if I can get my mechanic's job back.

226
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:14,181
- Twenty, 30, 40...
- Thanks for the cookies.

227
00:18:14,346 --> 00:18:18,437
...50... Welcome!
Sixty, 70, 80...

228
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:23,588
Okay, gang. Let's, like,
split up and search for clues.

229
00:18:23,754 --> 00:18:26,471
Scoob and I will go this way.
Come on, Scoob.

230
00:18:26,954 --> 00:18:29,343
He stole my thing that I say!

231
00:18:41,322 --> 00:18:44,519
Search for clues. Search for clues.

232
00:18:48,714 --> 00:18:50,536
A clue!

233
00:18:57,354 --> 00:18:59,329
Shiny footprints.

234
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:03,527
The glow is similar
to the pterodactyl scale.

235
00:19:13,738 --> 00:19:15,112
A clue!

236
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:20,712
It looks like Wickles shares Jacobo's
fascination with the supernatural.

237
00:19:21,162 --> 00:19:24,872
He collects everything
from Piri Reis to Aleister Crowley.

238
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:27,105
He collects dust too.

239
00:19:27,274 --> 00:19:30,787
No. The dust is good.
We can tell what he's been reading lately.

240
00:19:32,394 --> 00:19:33,604
Like here!

241
00:19:33,994 --> 00:19:35,271
What is it?

242
00:19:35,754 --> 00:19:40,544
It's an obsolete Celtic text used
by secret societies in the mid-19th century.

243
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:44,839
Look. The book belonged to J. Jacobo.

244
00:19:45,418 --> 00:19:47,240
The original Pterodactyl Ghost.

245
00:19:47,402 --> 00:19:50,085
Maybe he gave it to Wickles
before he died.

246
00:20:08,778 --> 00:20:10,152
Can you read it?

247
00:20:12,202 --> 00:20:15,584
It's an amalgamation
of magic and science.

248
00:20:15,754 --> 00:20:17,314
Here's a list of ingredients...

249
00:20:17,482 --> 00:20:21,825
...on how to create your own carbon-based,
organic, composite predators.

250
00:20:21,994 --> 00:20:25,442
This is an instruction manual
on how to create monsters.

251
00:20:30,793 --> 00:20:31,905
Scoob.

252
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,629
Clues!

253
00:20:35,528 --> 00:20:38,911
Those aren't clues, Scoob.
Those are just things you want.

254
00:20:39,081 --> 00:20:41,666
Like, why is a toilet brush a clue?

255
00:20:45,224 --> 00:20:49,959
Just because you can sing in it doesn't
make it a clue. It makes it awesome.

256
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,455
Like, what's this?

257
00:21:01,704 --> 00:21:03,559
"The Faux Ghost."

258
00:21:05,161 --> 00:21:07,135
We're in luck.
It's tonight, Scoob!

259
00:21:07,945 --> 00:21:09,800
- We are detectives.
- Really?

260
00:21:09,961 --> 00:21:12,350
You found an actual clue!

261
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:16,000
I found a clue!

262
00:21:17,449 --> 00:21:19,588
Do the clue dance! Do the clue dance!

263
00:21:19,753 --> 00:21:21,924
We're going back, we're going back!

264
00:21:32,745 --> 00:21:34,599
Black Knight Ghost!

265
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,494
Run, Shaggy!

266
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:44,705
Let's go.

267
00:21:45,385 --> 00:21:47,294
Like, lock the door!

268
00:21:51,945 --> 00:21:53,319
Heavy stuff, Scoob!

269
00:21:55,912 --> 00:21:57,505
Give me a hand, Scoob!

270
00:21:57,673 --> 00:21:59,877
See him get through this!

271
00:22:00,329 --> 00:22:01,441
Heavy!

272
00:22:02,665 --> 00:22:04,803
We outsmarted that moron!

273
00:22:04,968 --> 00:22:07,205
Yeah! What a moron.

274
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,542
Look at me.

275
00:22:09,993 --> 00:22:12,546
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

276
00:22:20,968 --> 00:22:22,790
- Yo, metalhead!
- Yes?

277
00:22:23,369 --> 00:22:24,514
Bring it.

278
00:22:28,808 --> 00:22:30,434
He brought it.

279
00:22:36,361 --> 00:22:37,986
Daphne! Hold him off!

280
00:22:38,152 --> 00:22:39,581
I'll look in the book.

281
00:22:39,753 --> 00:22:42,568
Maybe there's a formula
for finding his weakness.

282
00:22:47,977 --> 00:22:50,660
Here. "To find a creature's
weakest point...

283
00:22:52,073 --> 00:22:55,422
...take the angle between
the current position of the sun...

284
00:22:56,329 --> 00:22:58,718
...and your geographical point..."
- Velma!

285
00:22:59,368 --> 00:23:02,499
"Add this point, 28 and a half feet up
from sea level."

286
00:23:04,584 --> 00:23:05,991
That tickles.

287
00:23:06,152 --> 00:23:07,581
This is bad.

288
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:09,662
"Multiply this number..."

289
00:23:10,952 --> 00:23:12,578
"Add the square inches of..."

290
00:23:15,848 --> 00:23:16,993
Velma!

291
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,989
"Take the square root of 30,869..."

292
00:23:30,985 --> 00:23:33,221
Now it's good night, ladies!

293
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,585
"...your X-axis."

294
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:59,426
"And subtract 9034. That's your Y-axis."

295
00:23:59,593 --> 00:24:01,448
Look. No hands!

296
00:24:01,609 --> 00:24:03,365
Any time would be great, Velma!

297
00:24:03,529 --> 00:24:04,576
I'm trying.

298
00:24:04,745 --> 00:24:08,804
"Subtract one, divide by B,
follow upward eight degrees north."

299
00:24:08,968 --> 00:24:11,107
Which makes his weakest point right here!

300
00:24:15,049 --> 00:24:17,383
Right in the roundtables.

301
00:24:17,544 --> 00:24:18,591
Run!

302
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,997
In your face! Scooby-Dooby-Doo!

303
00:24:21,161 --> 00:24:23,266
Come on, Scoob! Inside!

304
00:24:26,728 --> 00:24:30,110
I'll compare the glow of those footprints
to the pterodactyl scale.

305
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,222
We'll check out Wickles' book.

306
00:24:32,392 --> 00:24:36,167
Dude, The Faux Ghost is an awesome clue.
But what do we do with it?

307
00:24:36,328 --> 00:24:38,084
Let's solve the mystery.

308
00:24:38,408 --> 00:24:40,448
If we solve the mystery by ourselves...

309
00:24:40,617 --> 00:24:43,366
...it would certainly prove to the gang
that we belong.

310
00:24:43,784 --> 00:24:45,377
Let's head to The Faux Ghost...

311
00:24:45,544 --> 00:24:47,617
...find Wickles, and see what he knows.

312
00:24:47,785 --> 00:24:51,559
But first, let's give the gang
the old "slipperooney."

313
00:25:00,296 --> 00:25:01,987
Hey, guys.

314
00:25:02,152 --> 00:25:04,356
Scooby's feeling kind of...

315
00:25:05,032 --> 00:25:07,203
...like he's got rabies.

316
00:25:11,272 --> 00:25:14,753
We're just gonna go outside
to get some fresh air.

317
00:25:26,472 --> 00:25:27,749
Jinkies!

318
00:25:33,609 --> 00:25:35,234
What's up, Velms?

319
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,702
The analysis of the pterodactyl scale.

320
00:25:37,865 --> 00:25:40,647
It contains randamonium,
which this books says...

321
00:25:40,808 --> 00:25:43,491
...is the critical ingredient
needed to make monsters.

322
00:25:43,656 --> 00:25:47,072
Doesn't randamonium glow,
like those footprints in Wickles' mansion?

323
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:51,070
If we prove Wickles is behind this,
this mystery goes down like a dot-com...

324
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,924
...and Coolsville digs us again.
- Where would he get randamonium?

325
00:25:54,088 --> 00:25:57,154
Randamonium is the byproduct
of silver mines.

326
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:00,222
Like the abandoned mining town
in old Coolsville.

327
00:26:00,393 --> 00:26:03,524
Then we better get to that mining town
and see what's...

328
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,393
I'm invisible. I'm invisible.

329
00:26:09,928 --> 00:26:11,041
Get rid of him!

330
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,473
Keep him busy.

331
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,360
What are you doing?

332
00:26:19,753 --> 00:26:21,662
He wants to ask me on a date.

333
00:26:21,832 --> 00:26:23,392
It's okay to be scared.

334
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:27,073
I am not scared.
I've fought werewolves and ghosts.

335
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,517
But in the end, we usually unmask them
and it's a little scared man inside.

336
00:26:31,688 --> 00:26:33,575
It's the same with dating.

337
00:26:34,568 --> 00:26:38,397
Velma, have you ever considered
that maybe werewolves and ghosts...

338
00:26:38,568 --> 00:26:42,278
...are just distractions to keep you away
from what really frightens you?

339
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,163
Intimacy with another person.

340
00:26:44,328 --> 00:26:47,394
And by intimacy, I mean someone
who thinks you're really hot.

341
00:26:49,096 --> 00:26:53,123
But I'm more comfortable
in the world of logic and facts.

342
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,135
And...

343
00:26:57,128 --> 00:27:00,773
...l'm not hot.

344
00:27:03,272 --> 00:27:04,799
Me neither.

345
00:27:04,969 --> 00:27:08,613
Everybody has flaws, Velma.
The object of a healthy relationship...

346
00:27:08,776 --> 00:27:11,645
...is to never let the other person
know they're there.

347
00:27:12,328 --> 00:27:14,150
- To museums.
- To museums.

348
00:27:14,664 --> 00:27:17,381
Daph, I really like this guy.

349
00:27:17,544 --> 00:27:19,552
What would you do if someone thought...

350
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:24,936
...that you were some glamorous
and mysterious jet-setter?

351
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,309
I'd make myself one.

352
00:27:41,416 --> 00:27:43,325
Who's your mommy?

353
00:27:46,216 --> 00:27:47,263
My mommy?

354
00:27:47,432 --> 00:27:49,821
Come on, let's solve a mystery.

355
00:28:06,761 --> 00:28:10,754
- Do you have to go to the bathroom?
- No, I can't in this outfit.

356
00:28:29,705 --> 00:28:32,323
Okay, Scooby-Doo, the coast is clear.

357
00:28:32,488 --> 00:28:33,436
Here we go.

358
00:28:42,984 --> 00:28:44,872
That's it, Scoob. The Faux Ghost.

359
00:28:45,032 --> 00:28:46,974
Man, I recognize a lot of these cats.

360
00:28:47,144 --> 00:28:50,493
Like, that's C.L. Magnus.
He used to dress up as Redbeard's ghost.

361
00:28:50,664 --> 00:28:54,177
And that's Aggie Wilkins,
a.k.a. the Ozark Witch.

362
00:28:54,792 --> 00:28:56,702
These are all folks we unmasked.

363
00:28:56,872 --> 00:28:59,742
If they spot us,
they'll invite us to a weenie roast.

364
00:28:59,912 --> 00:29:02,084
One where we're the weenies!

365
00:29:02,888 --> 00:29:04,317
Hot dogs!

366
00:29:04,488 --> 00:29:08,416
There's gotta be some way that we can
use our awesome, fearless new skills...

367
00:29:08,584 --> 00:29:11,683
...to get us in there
without being recognized.

368
00:29:40,552 --> 00:29:42,821
Everyone part like the Red Sea.

369
00:29:42,984 --> 00:29:47,457
It's me, Shizzy McCreepy,
and my brother, S.D. McCrawley.

370
00:29:47,624 --> 00:29:50,940
We are in the house and ready to party.

371
00:29:51,816 --> 00:29:52,961
Hey, handsome.

372
00:29:53,128 --> 00:29:54,950
Hello, baby.

373
00:29:55,336 --> 00:29:57,246
- <i>Zoinks!</i>
- <i>Jinkies!</i>

374
00:29:57,416 --> 00:29:58,845
- <i>Zoinks!</i>
- <i>Jinkies!</i>

375
00:29:59,016 --> 00:30:00,510
- <i>Hey, gang.</i>
- <i>Jinkies!</i>

376
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,793
- <i>Hey!</i>
- <i>Yipe!</i>

377
00:30:05,576 --> 00:30:09,919
A Ghost Clown is a heck of a lot scarier
than a Cotton Candy Glob!

378
00:30:13,192 --> 00:30:15,134
Watch out, idiot.

379
00:30:17,064 --> 00:30:19,934
- Old Man Wickles!
- Leave me alone.

380
00:30:21,673 --> 00:30:22,621
No!

381
00:30:23,816 --> 00:30:27,428
I just wanted to say thank you.

382
00:30:27,816 --> 00:30:32,901
Your portrayal of the Black Knight Ghost
was inspirational to my brother and me.

383
00:30:34,504 --> 00:30:38,465
Have you done anything cool
and creepy lately?

384
00:30:39,272 --> 00:30:42,720
Listen, I'm not normally one
for giving advice...

385
00:30:42,984 --> 00:30:47,207
...but I feel sorry for you because
of your brother's hideous nose deformity.

386
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:52,707
Get out of this game
while you got a chance.

387
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:56,004
All of us here ain't nothing to admire.

388
00:30:56,168 --> 00:30:59,103
We needed people to believe
we were different than we were.

389
00:30:59,272 --> 00:31:01,028
Maybe because we believed...

390
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:04,705
...that there was something wrong
with who we were in the first place.

391
00:31:05,608 --> 00:31:10,180
I guess you're sort of grateful
to Mystery Inc...

392
00:31:11,112 --> 00:31:14,079
...for unmasking you.
- Are you kidding?

393
00:31:15,912 --> 00:31:19,524
If I see those twerps,
I'd tear their eyes out of their skulls.

394
00:31:20,328 --> 00:31:24,606
Make them eat the one eye while watching
themselves eat it with the other eye!

395
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,639
Bye.

396
00:31:30,216 --> 00:31:34,918
Here's a clue for you.
That dude's wearing his freak hat 24/7.

397
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:38,757
I gotta take a whiz.
Don't do anything to attract attention.

398
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,131
Gotcha.

399
00:31:40,456 --> 00:31:41,732
Hey, doll.

400
00:31:42,504 --> 00:31:44,162
You wanna dance?

401
00:31:44,328 --> 00:31:45,473
Groovy.

402
00:31:48,136 --> 00:31:49,794
Here we go.

403
00:31:53,704 --> 00:31:55,395
Shake it, baby.

404
00:32:03,208 --> 00:32:04,735
Give me five!

405
00:32:27,784 --> 00:32:29,126
Oh, yeah!

406
00:32:30,408 --> 00:32:31,837
Everybody!

407
00:32:47,336 --> 00:32:48,798
Oh, yeah.

408
00:32:49,704 --> 00:32:50,653
Hey, Shaggy!

409
00:33:10,376 --> 00:33:13,725
It's Scooby-Doo! The meddling mutt
what helped throw us in jail!

410
00:33:14,824 --> 00:33:15,937
Who, me?

411
00:33:18,664 --> 00:33:21,217
No, wait, that's not Scooby-Doo!

412
00:33:21,384 --> 00:33:24,799
That's S.D. McCrawley.
He's just wearing a mask.

413
00:33:30,504 --> 00:33:35,108
And that's Doo's beatnik best pal,
Shaggy Rogers.

414
00:33:35,272 --> 00:33:37,312
- Where?
- There.

415
00:33:37,896 --> 00:33:40,100
Zoinks! Gangway!

416
00:33:42,792 --> 00:33:45,126
Run, Shaggy. Wait for me!

417
00:33:50,888 --> 00:33:52,579
And stay out!

418
00:33:56,744 --> 00:33:59,613
That wasn't so bad, Scoob.

419
00:34:15,815 --> 00:34:18,182
That was my outfit, I swear.

420
00:34:24,904 --> 00:34:29,411
You know, Velma,
you are as beautiful as ever.

421
00:34:30,792 --> 00:34:33,213
You're just so different than I expected.

422
00:34:34,824 --> 00:34:36,449
You know, I'm just...

423
00:34:39,432 --> 00:34:41,504
Find me the head of museum security.

424
00:34:41,672 --> 00:34:45,414
- Oh, my goodness!
- What the heck's going on?

425
00:34:45,575 --> 00:34:47,517
This cannot be good.

426
00:34:49,576 --> 00:34:51,037
My museum.

427
00:34:53,928 --> 00:34:55,269
Wait!

428
00:34:56,616 --> 00:34:58,404
Any comments on the museum robbery?

429
00:34:58,567 --> 00:35:01,415
Mystery Inc. is investigating
the two stolen costumes.

430
00:35:01,576 --> 00:35:03,431
No, the one that just happened.

431
00:35:03,592 --> 00:35:07,683
Where The Black Knight and Pterodactyl
Ghost stole the rest of the costumes?

432
00:35:07,848 --> 00:35:10,215
The rest of the costumes?

433
00:35:20,456 --> 00:35:23,772
So, what you're saying is
it's all downhill for Mystery Inc.

434
00:35:23,944 --> 00:35:28,286
No! You're doing that thing again where
you take everything I say out of context.

435
00:35:28,456 --> 00:35:31,489
You're trying to make it look
like I think Coolsville sucks.

436
00:35:31,655 --> 00:35:32,899
No! Don't record that!

437
00:35:41,224 --> 00:35:45,730
Patrick, I'm so sorry.
It must be so hard for you.

438
00:35:45,896 --> 00:35:47,718
I'm sorry, I have to go. Okay?

439
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:50,017
- I'll go with you...
- No! Just...

440
00:35:51,048 --> 00:35:54,048
No, I have to figure out what's going on.

441
00:36:17,512 --> 00:36:19,334
<i>All Fred Jones had to say was:</i>

442
00:36:19,496 --> 00:36:20,903
<i>I think Coolsville sucks!</i>

443
00:36:21,064 --> 00:36:23,486
<i>In light of the city's recent chaos...</i>

444
00:36:23,655 --> 00:36:27,398
<i>... Jones' response was disheartening</i>
<i>to the fans who have supported them.</i>

445
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:31,007
<i>Perhaps it's time for the crime-solving gang</i>
<i>to shape up or ship out.</i>

446
00:36:31,175 --> 00:36:32,124
I'll be right back.

447
00:36:32,295 --> 00:36:36,387
This is Heather Jasper-Howe
for Investigative Probe Reporting.

448
00:36:36,552 --> 00:36:38,723
What's with the personal attacks?

449
00:36:38,888 --> 00:36:41,735
Look, I'm a huge fan. It's just my editor...

450
00:36:41,895 --> 00:36:43,106
Who are you kidding?

451
00:36:45,383 --> 00:36:46,878
Who are you kidding?

452
00:36:47,047 --> 00:36:49,120
Don't think I don't know your game.

453
00:36:50,056 --> 00:36:51,485
What do you do for the gang?

454
00:36:52,008 --> 00:36:53,251
Really?

455
00:36:53,415 --> 00:36:57,212
Velma's the smart one. Fred's the leader.

456
00:36:57,384 --> 00:37:00,101
All you are is a pretty little face.

457
00:37:00,264 --> 00:37:01,606
Why are you doing this?

458
00:37:01,768 --> 00:37:06,045
Because it's my job to unmask
those who pretend to be who they're not.

459
00:37:07,815 --> 00:37:10,466
"Unmask those"? You sound like...

460
00:37:12,263 --> 00:37:13,824
Sound like who?

461
00:37:14,664 --> 00:37:16,573
The evil masked guy.

462
00:37:16,744 --> 00:37:20,322
But you know that, because
just as you know I'm standing here...

463
00:37:20,584 --> 00:37:24,708
...you know I know who you know you are,
which is him, who's a her, which is you.

464
00:37:25,512 --> 00:37:27,519
Now I see what you do for the gang.

465
00:37:27,688 --> 00:37:29,826
You're in charge of incoherent babbling.

466
00:37:29,991 --> 00:37:33,406
Mystery Incorporated.

467
00:37:34,247 --> 00:37:39,299
Once again, you are proven useless
before my power.

468
00:37:39,464 --> 00:37:43,326
Because of you, soon Coolsville...

469
00:37:43,847 --> 00:37:46,236
...will be mine.

470
00:37:48,872 --> 00:37:49,887
Darn it.

471
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:53,283
Thanks a lot!
The scoop of the night, gone.

472
00:37:53,447 --> 00:37:55,040
Can't you do anything right?

473
00:37:55,272 --> 00:37:57,377
Ned, get your camera and follow me.

474
00:37:57,544 --> 00:37:58,973
Guess not.

475
00:38:06,664 --> 00:38:08,290
Stop wasting my time!

476
00:38:08,584 --> 00:38:12,064
You hear me? Now I want you to question
all your scum-bucket friends.

477
00:38:12,231 --> 00:38:14,849
Find out what they know
about those stolen costumes.

478
00:38:15,015 --> 00:38:17,863
Or else you'll be known
as the Soiled Underwear Ghost!

479
00:38:18,024 --> 00:38:20,445
I want answers. Now, go! Now!

480
00:38:20,744 --> 00:38:21,824
Yes, sir!

481
00:38:22,695 --> 00:38:25,216
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

482
00:38:29,192 --> 00:38:30,402
Patrick.

483
00:38:30,567 --> 00:38:32,956
Shaggy. Scooby.

484
00:38:33,799 --> 00:38:35,686
What are you guys doing here?

485
00:38:36,872 --> 00:38:40,068
We just came down here
to be undercover and stuff.

486
00:38:40,872 --> 00:38:41,820
Me too.

487
00:38:41,991 --> 00:38:46,269
My museum got broken into again, so I had
to come here and try and get some answers.

488
00:38:46,439 --> 00:38:49,756
Gotta put on the tough-guy act,
or these guys will eat me alive.

489
00:38:51,368 --> 00:38:53,408
What's the matter, you don't believe me?

490
00:38:56,008 --> 00:38:57,469
I'm kidding!

491
00:38:58,375 --> 00:39:00,994
- It's the tough-guy act.
- That's good.

492
00:39:06,151 --> 00:39:07,100
I got you.

493
00:39:07,271 --> 00:39:09,443
That was a joke? That was good!

494
00:39:09,608 --> 00:39:11,779
You're a lot of fun. Try it, Scoob.

495
00:39:14,472 --> 00:39:16,098
It needs work.

496
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,142
Look, Patrick...

497
00:39:19,304 --> 00:39:24,006
...we could stay here, do this all night,
and something tells me you would...

498
00:39:24,168 --> 00:39:27,997
...but we gotta make
like your personality and split.

499
00:39:28,712 --> 00:39:29,824
Okay.

500
00:40:02,312 --> 00:40:03,741
Scooby-Doo. Scoob!

501
00:40:04,295 --> 00:40:05,757
Hello?

502
00:40:06,023 --> 00:40:07,779
Scooby-Doo, can you hear me?

503
00:40:07,943 --> 00:40:09,536
Hello, Shaggy.

504
00:40:09,703 --> 00:40:12,834
Wickles has led us
into a terrifying ghost town!

505
00:40:13,511 --> 00:40:16,741
- Ghost town?
- Yes, a ghost town!

506
00:40:22,183 --> 00:40:24,769
Darn bushes yowling at me again.

507
00:40:30,696 --> 00:40:33,925
- Keep quiet, Scoob.
- Okay, Shaggy.

508
00:40:38,888 --> 00:40:43,012
Like, where did Old Man Nutjob go?
Through here, Scoob?

509
00:40:43,175 --> 00:40:44,419
I don't know.

510
00:40:51,655 --> 00:40:53,117
Oh, boy.

511
00:41:09,864 --> 00:41:12,547
Run, Scoob! It's a "skelly" thingy!

512
00:41:23,943 --> 00:41:25,023
Elevator.

513
00:41:25,511 --> 00:41:27,038
Good work, pal!

514
00:41:27,783 --> 00:41:29,572
Like, let's skedaddle.

515
00:41:36,519 --> 00:41:38,908
So, what's your assessment, Velmster?

516
00:41:39,112 --> 00:41:41,533
This place seems harmless enough.

517
00:41:41,704 --> 00:41:45,413
I mean, whether the Evil Masked Figure
could've gotten his randamonium...

518
00:41:45,575 --> 00:41:47,517
...from here at the mine?
- Oh, sorry.

519
00:41:47,687 --> 00:41:50,655
I was just thinking about Patrick.

520
00:41:50,823 --> 00:41:53,060
He seemed so upset when he left.

521
00:41:53,383 --> 00:41:55,325
- Right. So...
- And...

522
00:41:57,127 --> 00:41:58,720
...he doesn't like me.

523
00:41:58,887 --> 00:42:01,756
Okay. So your assessment is?

524
00:42:02,664 --> 00:42:05,925
- Love stinks.
- Fred?

525
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:08,028
Do you think I'm just a pretty face?

526
00:42:08,295 --> 00:42:09,244
No.

527
00:42:10,055 --> 00:42:11,429
I mean, yes.

528
00:42:11,943 --> 00:42:13,318
I mean, not fat!

529
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:16,611
Definitely not fat.
Is this sort of what you're looking for?

530
00:42:16,775 --> 00:42:19,197
Fat? Why would you even use that word?

531
00:42:20,583 --> 00:42:24,064
Never again will they underestimate us.
That's right.

532
00:42:24,231 --> 00:42:27,046
I've gathered you here today
for something big.

533
00:42:27,399 --> 00:42:28,828
At last.

534
00:42:28,999 --> 00:42:31,650
All these years of careful planning...

535
00:42:31,816 --> 00:42:36,038
...have culminated
in this one glorious moment.

536
00:42:36,935 --> 00:42:41,158
Old Man Wickles, caught red-handed
in your foul monster-making scheme.

537
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:43,970
With your ugly, evil henchmen.

538
00:42:45,256 --> 00:42:46,466
Henchmen?

539
00:42:47,432 --> 00:42:51,174
Young man, we're investors,
and we're listening to his pitch.

540
00:42:51,559 --> 00:42:53,250
So as I was saying...

541
00:42:53,415 --> 00:42:56,098
...the Old Tyme Mining Town,
a summer camp for kids...

542
00:42:56,263 --> 00:42:58,947
...where they can have
an authentic mining experience.

543
00:42:59,304 --> 00:43:04,038
They can dig for 18 hours straight,
just like in the golden days of yore.

544
00:43:04,199 --> 00:43:07,909
They have the time of their lives,
and we get free miners!

545
00:43:08,679 --> 00:43:10,981
Mr. Wickles, we need to ask you about...

546
00:43:11,143 --> 00:43:15,234
...your ties to recent monster attacks.
- I don't know nothing about no monsters.

547
00:43:15,432 --> 00:43:18,693
Then how come there was randamonium
on the floor of your mansion?

548
00:43:18,856 --> 00:43:22,882
There's randamonium all over the place.
I come home with it in my shorts.

549
00:43:23,239 --> 00:43:26,403
Are you continuing the work
of your old pal Jonathan Jacobo?

550
00:43:26,567 --> 00:43:28,804
Old pal? Jacobo?

551
00:43:28,968 --> 00:43:30,724
We hated each other.

552
00:43:30,888 --> 00:43:33,986
In the prison cafeteria,
he used to steal my Tater Tots!

553
00:43:34,151 --> 00:43:36,224
And he got the lead in <i>My Fair Lady.</i>

554
00:43:36,392 --> 00:43:39,109
Then why did we find the monster book
in your library?

555
00:43:39,272 --> 00:43:42,271
Wait a second.
You're the runts what vandalized my home.

556
00:43:43,911 --> 00:43:46,278
Which one of you stole my toilet brush?

557
00:43:46,952 --> 00:43:48,261
Gentlemen.

558
00:43:49,384 --> 00:43:52,253
- I'm sorry, Jeremiah.
- What happened? I haven't finished!

559
00:43:52,423 --> 00:43:53,797
Wait, fellas!

560
00:43:54,439 --> 00:43:58,301
Wowee, Scooby-Doo!
I think we're onto something.

561
00:44:00,199 --> 00:44:02,500
It's like a huge laboratory.

562
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:08,036
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

563
00:44:15,271 --> 00:44:18,173
This place is like Clue-topia, Scoob.

564
00:44:23,783 --> 00:44:25,507
Refrigerator!

565
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,294
Lemonade!

566
00:44:35,943 --> 00:44:39,140
Check it out.
Look at those weird letters, Scoob.

567
00:44:40,423 --> 00:44:41,667
Shaggy?

568
00:44:44,519 --> 00:44:48,796
Scooby-Doo,
you turned into a freaky monster.

569
00:44:50,311 --> 00:44:52,483
You don't eat stuff that glows.

570
00:44:52,647 --> 00:44:55,713
There's got to be an antidote
in here somewhere.

571
00:44:55,879 --> 00:44:58,399
Try this, Scoob. It looks medicinal.

572
00:45:02,791 --> 00:45:04,166
Tastes like...

573
00:45:07,719 --> 00:45:09,213
Strawberries.

574
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:14,022
I'm okay, Scoob.

575
00:45:21,479 --> 00:45:23,716
I've got a chick's body!

576
00:45:25,032 --> 00:45:27,301
I'm the Tasmanian Devil!

577
00:45:45,031 --> 00:45:46,919
Check it out, dude!

578
00:45:47,783 --> 00:45:49,605
I'm buff.

579
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:51,840
My God.

580
00:45:52,103 --> 00:45:55,780
It seems as if I've become
ludicrously intelligent.

581
00:45:55,943 --> 00:45:59,140
It's awful! I long for the blissful ignorance
of my former self.

582
00:45:59,303 --> 00:46:02,402
Chasing cats, licking my own rear end,
eating my own vomit.

583
00:46:02,567 --> 00:46:05,055
Those were wonderful times.

584
00:46:05,223 --> 00:46:07,841
Check out my pecs, little man!

585
00:46:09,799 --> 00:46:13,628
Hush now, buffoon.
This is a highly combustible synthesis.

586
00:46:13,799 --> 00:46:14,747
A what?

587
00:46:14,919 --> 00:46:16,861
I'm going to transform us back!

588
00:46:17,031 --> 00:46:18,275
No way, geek!

589
00:46:19,399 --> 00:46:22,432
I'm gonna stay this way forever!

590
00:46:22,984 --> 00:46:24,031
No!

591
00:46:27,079 --> 00:46:28,224
Let's go!

592
00:46:32,839 --> 00:46:34,268
Careful, gang.

593
00:46:40,743 --> 00:46:43,907
This "Schwarzeneggian" oaf
almost destroyed us.

594
00:46:45,031 --> 00:46:46,438
Go boom.

595
00:46:47,367 --> 00:46:49,123
You are embarrassing.

596
00:47:02,791 --> 00:47:05,639
That was almost exactly like
my freshman year in college.

597
00:47:05,799 --> 00:47:09,061
What are you guys doing here?
You're supposed to be sick, Scooby.

598
00:47:09,223 --> 00:47:10,684
I invented a potion.

599
00:47:11,015 --> 00:47:12,542
You lied to us. We're a team.

600
00:47:12,711 --> 00:47:15,613
You don't just go off half-cocked
doing whatever you want.

601
00:47:15,783 --> 00:47:16,961
Hey, gang.

602
00:47:17,959 --> 00:47:21,406
"Beware who enters the Monster Hive.

603
00:47:22,023 --> 00:47:25,187
Inside your fears will come alive."

604
00:47:33,703 --> 00:47:35,045
Oh, my.

605
00:47:35,431 --> 00:47:38,530
Look! It's the costumes
from the museum!

606
00:47:38,695 --> 00:47:41,313
- Zombie.
- Miner 49er.

607
00:47:41,479 --> 00:47:44,512
- Captain Cutler.
- I bet they're all here.

608
00:47:44,743 --> 00:47:49,380
He must have used the costumes
to make real monsters, which implies...

609
00:47:49,543 --> 00:47:52,739
He needs the costumes to make
the monsters, which implies...

610
00:47:52,903 --> 00:47:57,954
He already had a Pterodactyl Ghost costume
somehow, which implies...

611
00:48:00,999 --> 00:48:03,203
Patrick's the one.

612
00:48:03,367 --> 00:48:04,796
Velma's in love.

613
00:48:05,031 --> 00:48:07,365
No, I mean the one.

614
00:48:08,167 --> 00:48:09,345
The bad guy.

615
00:48:10,407 --> 00:48:13,057
That's why he wanted to go out with me.

616
00:48:14,791 --> 00:48:16,352
To see what we knew.

617
00:48:16,519 --> 00:48:19,202
We just saw Patrick
at the bad guys' hangout.

618
00:48:19,367 --> 00:48:22,466
He was working both sides
of Psycho Street.

619
00:48:22,631 --> 00:48:26,560
I don't know who's behind this, but we
don't need him transforming more costumes.

620
00:48:26,727 --> 00:48:29,661
Let's find a way to shut down
this monster-maker for good.

621
00:48:29,831 --> 00:48:32,035
Guys? What's over here?

622
00:48:32,199 --> 00:48:34,304
This light is strange.

623
00:48:35,271 --> 00:48:36,219
Scooby-Doo.

624
00:48:36,647 --> 00:48:40,225
We're the ones that found this place.
Score one for the big guys!

625
00:48:40,743 --> 00:48:44,671
Now we need to keep acting
like mondo-groovy detectives. Come on.

626
00:48:56,903 --> 00:48:57,983
Like, wowee.

627
00:49:06,023 --> 00:49:08,325
Cool! Like, "tuneage."

628
00:49:33,639 --> 00:49:35,875
Like, what's that weird sound?

629
00:49:38,823 --> 00:49:40,165
Captain Cutler!

630
00:49:40,839 --> 00:49:42,268
Miner 49er!

631
00:49:42,983 --> 00:49:44,957
The Tar Monster!

632
00:49:45,927 --> 00:49:47,072
We have...

633
00:49:47,623 --> 00:49:49,510
...to remain...

634
00:49:49,991 --> 00:49:51,136
...calm.

635
00:49:52,007 --> 00:49:54,342
Calm, Scooby-Doo!
You're not being calm!

636
00:49:55,591 --> 00:49:58,461
I needed that.
I needed that too.

637
00:49:58,631 --> 00:50:00,704
You're pushing your luck, Scoob!

638
00:50:06,663 --> 00:50:08,802
You girls find anything?

639
00:50:10,791 --> 00:50:13,027
- He did it.
- Scoob!

640
00:50:13,351 --> 00:50:15,587
Fred, disconnect that control panel!

641
00:50:15,751 --> 00:50:17,955
Maybe it'll stop the machine!

642
00:50:46,471 --> 00:50:49,766
Come on, this way! Quick, the elevator!

643
00:50:52,391 --> 00:50:55,555
- Like, The 10,000 Volt Ghost!
- Come on, Scoob!

644
00:50:57,031 --> 00:50:58,078
We're gonna die!

645
00:50:58,247 --> 00:51:00,516
- Think positive!
- We're gonna die quickly!

646
00:51:01,127 --> 00:51:02,982
Wait for me!

647
00:51:19,430 --> 00:51:20,576
Come on, girls!

648
00:51:23,270 --> 00:51:26,140
- An exit!
- Run, Shaggy!

649
00:51:37,062 --> 00:51:38,786
Stop them!

650
00:51:39,431 --> 00:51:44,417
Destroy the city if you have to,
but get me that control panel!

651
00:51:44,583 --> 00:51:49,122
With it, they can destroy everything
I've set out to do.

652
00:51:49,286 --> 00:51:51,839
Hurry up, gang.
We need to find Shaggy and Scooby.

653
00:51:52,007 --> 00:51:54,822
End of the line, Mystery Inc.!

654
00:51:56,839 --> 00:51:57,787
Die!

655
00:52:03,879 --> 00:52:05,602
Let's book, Scoob.

656
00:52:11,079 --> 00:52:12,191
Oh, boy.

657
00:52:14,246 --> 00:52:15,621
Let's rip it, Scoob!

658
00:52:16,166 --> 00:52:17,443
Zoinks!

659
00:52:33,031 --> 00:52:34,241
I don't know.

660
00:52:37,063 --> 00:52:38,273
Banzai!

661
00:52:39,399 --> 00:52:40,959
We're getting rad!

662
00:52:41,607 --> 00:52:44,541
Like, this pipe's ripping, Scoob!
Zoinks!

663
00:53:14,343 --> 00:53:15,291
Hello.

664
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:28,416
Scooby!

665
00:53:38,182 --> 00:53:39,230
Are you guys okay?

666
00:53:39,719 --> 00:53:44,421
Sure. As long as you define "okay"
as "in massive agony."

667
00:53:45,927 --> 00:53:47,749
We should get back to headquarters.

668
00:53:47,911 --> 00:53:50,464
No! That'll be the first place
they'll look for us.

669
00:53:50,631 --> 00:53:52,092
I think I know where to go.

670
00:53:53,990 --> 00:53:56,478
Move that worthless piece of tin!

671
00:53:56,807 --> 00:54:00,385
Unlike some of you,
I have a very important meeting!

672
00:54:11,718 --> 00:54:15,296
Citizens! Turn in Mystery Inc.

673
00:54:15,462 --> 00:54:19,935
Your reward: We'll let you live.

674
00:54:22,503 --> 00:54:26,976
My monsters can make life very unpleasant.

675
00:54:37,031 --> 00:54:41,766
Find me Mystery Inc., now.

676
00:54:42,246 --> 00:54:46,305
Heather Jasper-Howe with an emergency
update for Investigative Probe.

677
00:54:46,471 --> 00:54:48,959
A monster army has invaded Coolsville.

678
00:54:49,126 --> 00:54:52,869
<i>Angry citizens have gathered</i>
<i>outside Mystery Inc. 's offices in protest.</i>

679
00:54:53,031 --> 00:54:56,805
<i>They're insisting the gang cooperate</i>
<i>with the Evil Masked Figure's demands.</i>

680
00:54:56,967 --> 00:54:59,105
<i>Mystery Stink! Mystery Stink!</i>

681
00:55:02,951 --> 00:55:05,984
Excuse me, sir.
Do you have anything to say for yourself?

682
00:55:14,151 --> 00:55:15,939
<i>I beg you, Mystery Inc.</i>

683
00:55:16,102 --> 00:55:19,419
<i>If you can hear me, turn yourselves in.</i>

684
00:55:19,590 --> 00:55:23,846
If we do, he'll get the control panel back,
and the city will be in worse shape.

685
00:55:24,007 --> 00:55:26,724
We'd be playing right into his hands.

686
00:55:26,887 --> 00:55:29,854
Please. For our city's sake.

687
00:55:36,551 --> 00:55:39,420
<i>Sorry. You're cancelled.</i>

688
00:56:05,717 --> 00:56:08,499
The old high-school clubhouse.

689
00:56:11,285 --> 00:56:12,812
We should be safe here.

690
00:56:12,981 --> 00:56:15,501
We haven't been here in years.

691
00:56:24,374 --> 00:56:25,934
Freddy, are you okay?

692
00:56:26,741 --> 00:56:30,058
- Do you wanna talk?
- Talking's for wimps.

693
00:56:35,094 --> 00:56:36,752
It's time for action.

694
00:56:39,349 --> 00:56:40,658
You know, Scoob...

695
00:56:40,821 --> 00:56:45,229
...this Evil Masked Figure
is turning Coolsville into Ghoulsville.

696
00:56:45,461 --> 00:56:48,308
And the gang is totally taking a hit for it.

697
00:56:50,069 --> 00:56:53,899
Like, this is the most "our-faultiest"
screwup ever, Scoob.

698
00:56:58,101 --> 00:56:59,661
Still works.

699
00:57:01,077 --> 00:57:03,827
Look, all my old tools.

700
00:57:05,910 --> 00:57:08,812
After all our so-called success...

701
00:57:08,981 --> 00:57:11,054
...we're back in this old firetrap.

702
00:57:24,277 --> 00:57:26,187
Keep away! Go out.

703
00:57:26,357 --> 00:57:28,943
- Hit me, Fred. I'm open!
- Get it, Shaggy!

704
00:57:29,621 --> 00:57:30,897
Good one.

705
00:57:34,358 --> 00:57:35,568
Velma, here!

706
00:57:35,733 --> 00:57:36,943
Good throw, Velm!

707
00:57:37,109 --> 00:57:39,498
- Fred! It's mine.
- Gotcha!

708
00:57:44,117 --> 00:57:45,546
Throw it to me!

709
00:57:45,717 --> 00:57:47,212
Go long!

710
00:57:48,725 --> 00:57:50,219
Go, Scooby!

711
00:57:51,029 --> 00:57:52,458
Dude!

712
00:57:57,493 --> 00:57:59,882
It all seemed so easy back then.

713
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:07,185
We solved mysteries for the love of them,
not to prove anything to anyone.

714
00:58:08,373 --> 00:58:12,813
And the mysteries all seemed
to unravel themselves.

715
00:58:12,981 --> 00:58:16,658
Sometimes, the answers
would just appear like magic.

716
00:58:18,709 --> 00:58:21,491
My first multiple-resonance
imaging device.

717
00:58:21,654 --> 00:58:25,428
Made out of a crystal radio
and old video games.

718
00:58:27,221 --> 00:58:28,682
Wait a minute.

719
00:58:29,205 --> 00:58:33,777
Randamonium has an algorithmic
cross-currency of negative 4.121.

720
00:58:34,293 --> 00:58:36,365
With it, maybe...
Well, just maybe...

721
00:58:36,565 --> 00:58:40,339
We could reverse the current
and reverse the monster-making process!

722
00:58:40,501 --> 00:58:42,835
All we need to do
is rewire the control panel...

723
00:58:42,997 --> 00:58:45,997
Bring it back to the Monster Hive
and plug it into the base.

724
00:58:46,165 --> 00:58:48,914
- Push the button...
- And instead of creating monsters...

725
00:58:49,077 --> 00:58:51,052
...all the monsters will be destroyed.

726
00:59:22,069 --> 00:59:25,746
Like, they're totally having
a montage in there without us.

727
00:59:27,093 --> 00:59:31,533
I'll tell you one thing for sure.
They don't need our help to figure it out.

728
00:59:31,701 --> 00:59:33,359
We're screwups.

729
00:59:33,525 --> 00:59:38,032
The only time we do anything right is when
we accidentally plow into the Snow Ghost...

730
00:59:38,197 --> 00:59:42,638
...because we've accidentally glued our feet
to rocket-powered roller-skates.

731
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:45,201
Eight stupid times.

732
00:59:46,645 --> 00:59:48,052
Face it, Scoob.

733
00:59:48,213 --> 00:59:51,409
We'll never be anything
but our old goofy selves.

734
00:59:52,213 --> 00:59:54,122
I wish once...

735
00:59:54,293 --> 00:59:56,016
...just once...

736
00:59:56,341 --> 00:59:58,959
...I could do the right thing on purpose.

737
01:00:00,565 --> 01:00:01,842
You know, Scoob?

738
01:00:03,733 --> 01:00:05,521
Like, be a hero...

739
01:00:06,293 --> 01:00:08,082
...and save the day.

740
01:00:10,485 --> 01:00:12,373
But who are we kidding, right?

741
01:00:24,053 --> 01:00:25,580
Captain Cutler's Ghost.

742
01:00:26,773 --> 01:00:30,385
Captain Cutler's Ghost!

743
01:00:31,701 --> 01:00:35,662
They found us. Finish that in the van
when we get to the Monster Hive.

744
01:00:43,349 --> 01:00:45,651
Go, Fred! Hit it!

745
01:00:56,053 --> 01:00:57,580
- What do we do?
- What do we do?

746
01:00:57,749 --> 01:00:59,440
Fine. Let's go back!

747
01:01:00,821 --> 01:01:02,446
That's the wrong way!

748
01:01:15,221 --> 01:01:16,846
Shaggy! Give me a hand.

749
01:01:17,013 --> 01:01:19,599
This is tied for
the most terrifying day of my life.

750
01:01:19,765 --> 01:01:22,896
- Tied with what?
- Every other freaking day of my life!

751
01:01:23,061 --> 01:01:24,009
It's done!

752
01:01:33,525 --> 01:01:35,412
Jinkies! Tweety's back.

753
01:01:35,573 --> 01:01:36,751
- Shaggy!
- Yeah?

754
01:01:36,917 --> 01:01:39,503
I'm putting her in cruise.
Take the wheel.

755
01:01:39,668 --> 01:01:41,163
Go!

756
01:01:51,829 --> 01:01:52,811
Take this!

757
01:01:55,893 --> 01:01:58,543
- This is bad.
- No doubt.

758
01:01:59,701 --> 01:02:00,846
- Shaggy?
- Yeah.

759
01:02:01,013 --> 01:02:02,442
Who's driving?

760
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:04,969
Hello.

761
01:02:05,141 --> 01:02:06,318
- Scoob.
- What?

762
01:02:21,908 --> 01:02:24,145
- Turn the wheel!
- Wheel?

763
01:02:24,309 --> 01:02:26,643
- Turn the wheel!
- The round thing, Scoob!

764
01:02:32,949 --> 01:02:35,218
- Scooby!
- Okay.

765
01:02:43,349 --> 01:02:44,810
I'm driving!

766
01:02:52,565 --> 01:02:53,842
Watch out, Scoob!

767
01:02:59,252 --> 01:03:00,976
You did it, Scoob!

768
01:03:06,645 --> 01:03:09,994
All right, gang.
The Monster Hive is right over there.

769
01:03:10,164 --> 01:03:12,620
Let's get this control panel
and plug her in.

770
01:03:26,869 --> 01:03:29,902
You go nowhere, knave.

771
01:03:31,125 --> 01:03:33,165
You guys take the long way around.

772
01:03:34,485 --> 01:03:35,826
And I'll hold him off.

773
01:03:38,293 --> 01:03:41,327
- Come on.
- Go get him, Fred.

774
01:04:48,021 --> 01:04:50,541
- Come on, Daph!
- I'm coming!

775
01:04:52,949 --> 01:04:55,218
Not so fast!

776
01:04:57,301 --> 01:05:01,491
You guys go. I'll take care of Sparky.
Just get that control panel to the Hive.

777
01:05:01,653 --> 01:05:03,758
- Go!
- We've got it, Daph!

778
01:05:15,285 --> 01:05:16,626
Scary.

779
01:05:16,788 --> 01:05:19,123
Taste the pain, Mr. Glowy Ugly Thing.

780
01:05:34,389 --> 01:05:35,337
Daph?

781
01:05:36,405 --> 01:05:39,219
- Daph, are you okay?
- I think so.

782
01:05:43,221 --> 01:05:45,009
Guess this is it, huh?

783
01:05:45,621 --> 01:05:46,897
Oh, baby.

784
01:05:48,853 --> 01:05:50,609
I'm afraid.

785
01:05:52,853 --> 01:05:54,413
What a wimp, huh?

786
01:05:55,349 --> 01:05:57,585
That doesn't make you a wimp.

787
01:05:58,932 --> 01:06:00,842
Makes you human.

788
01:06:06,229 --> 01:06:07,374
The Skeleton Men.

789
01:06:09,269 --> 01:06:12,236
- He does that when he gets nervous.
- Sorry.

790
01:06:25,621 --> 01:06:28,785
- Here, Shaggy, take this.
- Why are you giving this to me?

791
01:06:28,948 --> 01:06:31,021
I'll distract those skeletal screwballs.

792
01:06:31,189 --> 01:06:34,156
- Get this to the Monster Hive.
- Us?

793
01:06:34,325 --> 01:06:35,535
You're faster than me.

794
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:39,083
Once there, just plug it into the base.
Push this button.

795
01:06:39,252 --> 01:06:41,903
I fixed it so it will destroy all the monsters.

796
01:06:42,709 --> 01:06:44,083
But...

797
01:06:44,565 --> 01:06:47,467
...we can't.
- We're screwups.

798
01:06:47,636 --> 01:06:50,189
We tried to be heroes like you guys,
but we're not.

799
01:06:50,356 --> 01:06:52,080
- We're just not.
- No.

800
01:06:52,245 --> 01:06:53,619
Like me?

801
01:06:56,724 --> 01:07:00,336
That's funny.
I always wanted to be like you guys.

802
01:07:01,461 --> 01:07:05,803
You guys are so free. You're never afraid
to be who you really are.

803
01:07:06,068 --> 01:07:10,803
Whether you're fearful or joyful or hungry.

804
01:07:12,148 --> 01:07:14,320
I think you've been heroes all along.

805
01:07:15,253 --> 01:07:16,944
You just haven't known it.

806
01:07:20,372 --> 01:07:21,321
Here I go.

807
01:07:25,749 --> 01:07:27,178
Heroes.

808
01:07:27,829 --> 01:07:29,203
Heroes.

809
01:07:29,524 --> 01:07:31,696
On your knees, knave.

810
01:07:31,861 --> 01:07:33,454
Can't you see we're talking?

811
01:07:34,580 --> 01:07:36,882
Talking is for wimps.

812
01:07:39,093 --> 01:07:41,743
You can't fool me
with that macho façade.

813
01:07:42,293 --> 01:07:45,489
You're just afraid to show
your sensitive side.

814
01:07:46,613 --> 01:07:48,784
You've touched my inner child.

815
01:07:49,940 --> 01:07:51,599
And he's really mad!

816
01:07:53,493 --> 01:07:54,922
Come on, Scoob.

817
01:07:58,293 --> 01:08:01,773
Miner 49er!

818
01:08:16,693 --> 01:08:19,246
I'll get you, you varmints!

819
01:08:45,845 --> 01:08:47,754
Dead end.

820
01:08:50,133 --> 01:08:53,199
Remember when we were young
and you used to wear that jumper?

821
01:08:54,804 --> 01:08:57,935
- What? Me? In a jumper?
- And we used to watch cable?

822
01:09:04,789 --> 01:09:05,803
Do it!

823
01:09:10,932 --> 01:09:12,307
Lights out.

824
01:09:17,013 --> 01:09:18,474
Blackout! Blackout!

825
01:09:28,341 --> 01:09:29,289
Oh, crap.

826
01:09:49,205 --> 01:09:52,074
Take this, daddy-o. It's a real gas.

827
01:10:02,612 --> 01:10:04,881
Come on. Let's go, Scoob!

828
01:10:07,732 --> 01:10:09,456
My glasses.

829
01:10:09,940 --> 01:10:12,722
Oh, brother. Not again.

830
01:10:13,365 --> 01:10:15,885
I've got to consider contact lenses.

831
01:10:16,693 --> 01:10:17,641
What?

832
01:10:34,612 --> 01:10:38,158
Some kind of scary bat.

833
01:10:39,893 --> 01:10:41,322
Wait a minute.

834
01:10:44,148 --> 01:10:45,642
That's the pterodactyl.

835
01:10:47,348 --> 01:10:49,258
The Pterodactyl Ghost.

836
01:10:52,565 --> 01:10:53,994
What's this?

837
01:11:11,669 --> 01:11:13,010
A shrine!

838
01:11:13,941 --> 01:11:16,362
To Jonathan Jacobo?

839
01:11:17,972 --> 01:11:20,525
But who would be so obsessed with him?

840
01:11:25,620 --> 01:11:26,568
Velma.

841
01:11:28,341 --> 01:11:29,421
Lose something?

842
01:11:39,444 --> 01:11:40,557
Patrick.

843
01:11:44,724 --> 01:11:46,131
What are you doing here?

844
01:11:47,093 --> 01:11:49,678
I'm trying to solve this mystery.
Same as you.

845
01:11:51,060 --> 01:11:54,802
That is what you're doing, right?
Trying to solve this mystery?

846
01:11:54,965 --> 01:11:56,274
Yes.

847
01:11:58,005 --> 01:12:01,136
Why are you so obsessed
with Jonathan Jacobo?

848
01:12:03,188 --> 01:12:06,058
- What are you talking about?
- No way, Jose.

849
01:12:06,420 --> 01:12:07,565
Velma.

850
01:12:12,948 --> 01:12:14,541
Stay away from me.

851
01:12:15,893 --> 01:12:17,005
I know who you are.

852
01:12:24,660 --> 01:12:28,075
- Velma, let go of the grate.
- So I can fall to my death?

853
01:12:28,244 --> 01:12:29,837
No, so I can pull you up.

854
01:12:33,044 --> 01:12:36,525
- You gotta trust me.
- No. I only trust the facts.

855
01:12:36,692 --> 01:12:39,824
And all the facts say
that you're the Evil Masked Figure.

856
01:12:41,172 --> 01:12:43,059
What does your heart say?

857
01:12:43,221 --> 01:12:47,214
I don't know.
It's beating too loud for me to hear.

858
01:12:48,373 --> 01:12:50,925
Look deeper. You gotta trust me.

859
01:13:05,301 --> 01:13:06,577
You saved my life.

860
01:13:09,812 --> 01:13:11,022
Patrick!

861
01:13:14,453 --> 01:13:15,500
Velma!

862
01:13:15,765 --> 01:13:17,674
That thing just flew off with Patrick!

863
01:13:17,844 --> 01:13:21,837
The best we can do for him is get
that control panel back where it belongs.

864
01:13:23,508 --> 01:13:24,620
Where is it?

865
01:13:26,612 --> 01:13:29,427
I gave it to Shaggy and Scooby.

866
01:13:30,165 --> 01:13:34,387
That's weird. It sounded like you just said
you gave it to Shaggy and Scooby.

867
01:13:44,980 --> 01:13:46,889
I think we lost them.

868
01:13:48,532 --> 01:13:50,866
Scoob, we made it.

869
01:13:52,084 --> 01:13:55,019
You should never have locked those locks.

870
01:13:55,188 --> 01:13:57,643
Now you're stuck in here with me!

871
01:13:57,812 --> 01:14:00,561
The Cotton Candy Glob.

872
01:14:00,756 --> 01:14:03,822
- Cotton Candy Glob?
- Cotton Candy Glob?

873
01:14:04,820 --> 01:14:06,479
Yes.

874
01:14:13,780 --> 01:14:17,609
- No! I'll give you cavities!
- I don't see Shaggy and Scooby anywhere.

875
01:14:17,780 --> 01:14:20,846
Poor guys are probably running around
helpless and terrified.

876
01:14:24,436 --> 01:14:27,916
This is like the greatest day
of our lives, Scoob.

877
01:14:28,084 --> 01:14:30,899
Finally, a monster
we could sink our teeth into.

878
01:14:31,060 --> 01:14:35,762
I'm kind of thirsty. I wonder if there's
a Liter-sized Soda Glob anywhere?

879
01:14:35,924 --> 01:14:39,121
- Come on, guys. We have to hurry.
- Come on.

880
01:14:39,285 --> 01:14:41,903
We have to get this
control panel back before...

881
01:14:48,916 --> 01:14:50,509
Before exactly that happens.

882
01:14:50,676 --> 01:14:54,288
At last I have you, Mystery Inc.

883
01:14:54,868 --> 01:14:58,829
You'll never make it past my monsters.

884
01:14:58,996 --> 01:15:02,192
We've taken these jerks before, gang.
Let's do it again.

885
01:15:06,516 --> 01:15:10,640
- Fred!
- It's not them you need to worry about.

886
01:15:12,852 --> 01:15:14,761
Now you are stuck in my trap.

887
01:15:15,540 --> 01:15:16,653
Daphne!

888
01:15:19,860 --> 01:15:20,939
Daph!

889
01:15:26,420 --> 01:15:27,827
Gotcha!

890
01:15:29,524 --> 01:15:30,931
Go! Daphne!

891
01:15:31,092 --> 01:15:32,434
- Velma!
- I'm open!

892
01:15:37,044 --> 01:15:38,800
Shaggy! Here!

893
01:15:41,172 --> 01:15:42,121
Come on!

894
01:15:45,524 --> 01:15:48,591
Soon your friends will be dead...

895
01:15:48,756 --> 01:15:50,545
...and Coolsville destroyed.

896
01:15:51,252 --> 01:15:53,259
My revenge will be final...

897
01:15:53,908 --> 01:15:57,170
...and there's nothing you can do about it.

898
01:15:57,653 --> 01:15:58,830
Help, Velma!

899
01:16:01,844 --> 01:16:02,793
Daphne?

900
01:16:04,948 --> 01:16:07,665
- Shaggy?
- Scoob...

901
01:16:22,228 --> 01:16:23,919
Dude.

902
01:16:30,484 --> 01:16:34,129
- Like, frostbite never felt so good!
- Stop them!

903
01:16:35,892 --> 01:16:38,543
- Go long, Scoob!
- Okay.

904
01:16:41,524 --> 01:16:43,182
Here, doggy-doggy.

905
01:16:45,268 --> 01:16:46,348
Rail glide!

906
01:16:46,516 --> 01:16:49,483
Watch this! Roll barrel!

907
01:16:57,300 --> 01:16:58,642
Hang time!

908
01:17:01,748 --> 01:17:04,498
End of the line, Doo!

909
01:17:05,300 --> 01:17:07,689
Come here, you worthless mutt!

910
01:17:33,460 --> 01:17:34,474
Scoob!

911
01:17:41,300 --> 01:17:43,155
You can do it, buddy!

912
01:17:54,996 --> 01:17:57,931
You can't do this to me!

913
01:17:58,100 --> 01:18:00,718
Who do you think you are?

914
01:18:01,524 --> 01:18:02,833
Scooby...

915
01:18:02,996 --> 01:18:04,174
...Dooby...

916
01:18:04,340 --> 01:18:05,288
...Doo!

917
01:18:09,204 --> 01:18:10,797
No!

918
01:18:35,060 --> 01:18:36,882
My monsters!

919
01:18:43,860 --> 01:18:46,413
You did it! You saved us all!

920
01:18:46,580 --> 01:18:47,824
I know.

921
01:18:57,779 --> 01:19:01,041
Do you know the identity
of the Evil Masked Figure behind it all?

922
01:19:01,204 --> 01:19:04,335
If our hunch is correct,
the Evil Masked Figure is...

923
01:19:04,499 --> 01:19:05,677
No!

924
01:19:10,163 --> 01:19:11,440
Heather Jasper-Howe.

925
01:19:14,132 --> 01:19:16,882
But she was at the museum
when the Masked Figure was on the roof.

926
01:19:17,044 --> 01:19:18,931
You almost had me there, didn't you?

927
01:19:19,092 --> 01:19:22,441
Lucky for her, she had an assistant
helping her with her evil plans.

928
01:19:24,244 --> 01:19:25,193
Ned.

929
01:19:28,051 --> 01:19:30,507
<i>When I realized</i>
<i>she was the Evil Masked Figure...</i>

930
01:19:30,675 --> 01:19:32,912
<i>... he quickly changed into her costume.</i>

931
01:19:33,076 --> 01:19:34,188
But why did she do it?

932
01:19:34,356 --> 01:19:38,546
Because Heather Jasper-Howe
is actually...

933
01:19:42,580 --> 01:19:44,969
...Doctor Jonathan Jacobo.

934
01:19:45,652 --> 01:19:47,953
The original Pterodactyl Ghost.

935
01:19:48,116 --> 01:19:49,676
But how do you know this?

936
01:19:49,844 --> 01:19:53,935
A photo, taken of Jacobo
in front of the Coolsonian.

937
01:19:54,100 --> 01:19:57,329
Jacobo supposedly died
a year before construction even began.

938
01:19:57,492 --> 01:20:00,841
So Jacobo survived that fall
off the prison wall.

939
01:20:01,332 --> 01:20:05,555
He adapted the false Heather Jasper-Howe
persona to turn the press against us.

940
01:20:05,716 --> 01:20:07,374
Then he framed Old Man Wickles...

941
01:20:07,540 --> 01:20:10,856
...by putting that book
and The Black Knight Ghost in his mansion.

942
01:20:11,028 --> 01:20:14,094
As if you getting the lead
in <i>My Fair Lady</i> wasn't enough!

943
01:20:14,260 --> 01:20:18,035
I was an excellent Eliza!
You were too act-y.

944
01:20:18,196 --> 01:20:20,051
And stealing my Tater Tots!

945
01:20:20,212 --> 01:20:22,186
You kept saying you felt puffy!

946
01:20:23,188 --> 01:20:26,188
And the real identity of Ned is...

947
01:20:29,332 --> 01:20:30,510
Ned.

948
01:20:32,819 --> 01:20:36,780
I would have gotten away with it
if it weren't for those meddling punks...

949
01:20:36,948 --> 01:20:38,410
...and their dumb dog!

950
01:20:43,444 --> 01:20:47,273
- You were a dude this whole time?
- Of course, <i>dummkopf</i>.

951
01:20:48,083 --> 01:20:49,610
But we cuddled.

952
01:20:55,284 --> 01:20:57,389
- Hi.
- Hi.

953
01:20:58,580 --> 01:21:01,875
Listen, Velma, I know
that must have seemed very suspicious...

954
01:21:02,035 --> 01:21:05,199
...but you've got to believe me
that I had nothing to do with...

955
01:21:06,164 --> 01:21:07,593
I trust you.

956
01:21:08,339 --> 01:21:09,866
Listen, Patrick.

957
01:21:11,060 --> 01:21:14,737
I'm not glamorous or mysterious.

958
01:21:15,444 --> 01:21:17,069
But one thing that's true is...

959
01:21:19,220 --> 01:21:20,910
...that I like you.

960
01:21:22,228 --> 01:21:23,373
Very much.

961
01:21:25,075 --> 01:21:28,424
And I would like
to go out with you again.

962
01:21:29,236 --> 01:21:32,400
But this time, I will go as myself.

963
01:21:35,540 --> 01:21:38,703
Yeah, I'd like that, more than anything.

964
01:21:40,019 --> 01:21:41,197
Okay.

965
01:21:44,788 --> 01:21:48,104
<i>Mystery Inc.! Mystery Inc.!</i>

966
01:21:49,844 --> 01:21:51,698
They're cheering for us again.

967
01:21:51,924 --> 01:21:52,872
Yep.

968
01:21:53,044 --> 01:21:56,143
I always thought that was
the best thing in the world.

969
01:21:56,308 --> 01:21:58,674
I guess I found something
a little bit better.

970
01:22:00,820 --> 01:22:04,235
- Can we get your photo in this?
- Yes.

971
01:22:12,371 --> 01:22:14,608
Yikes! A monster!

972
01:22:20,084 --> 01:22:23,467
- Like, Scoob, it's me, man!
- Shaggy!

973
01:22:33,012 --> 01:22:35,532
Scooby-Dooby-Doo!

974
01:22:37,716 --> 01:22:39,472
Sing it up, Ruben.

975
01:22:43,764 --> 01:22:44,712
Everybody.

976
01:23:06,036 --> 01:23:07,442
Come on, Shaggy.

977
01:23:10,292 --> 01:23:11,721
Get down.

978
01:28:35,796 --> 01:28:38,130
Game Boy Advance secret code.

979
