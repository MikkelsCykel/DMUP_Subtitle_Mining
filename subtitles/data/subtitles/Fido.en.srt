Zomcon presents...

2
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,478
<i>A Bright New World</i>.

3
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:17,248
From the darkest depths
of outer space

4
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,751
came an evil no man could predict.

5
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:24,756
A cloud of radiation engulfed
our great planet.

6
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:27,918
Scientists discovered
that these space particles

7
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:31,088
caused the reanimation
of dead bodies...

8
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:32,221
Zombies!

9
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:35,426
Creatures with but one
destructive need...

10
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:38,231
to devour the flesh of the living.

11
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:42,900
And so, we were forced
to defend our homeland.

12
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:44,601
The Zombie Wars...

13
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:49,171
mankind pitted against
legions of the undead.

14
00:00:49,282 --> 00:00:52,274
But in our darkest hour,

15
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:53,682
a savior...

16
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:57,279
Zomcon, and our founder,

17
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,450
Dr. Reinhold Geiger.

18
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,961
Dr. Geiger discovered
that if the brain was destroyed,

19
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:06,965
the zombie was destroyed,

20
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,329
never to reanimate.

21
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:17,240
And so,
the Zombie Wars were won.

22
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:19,140
Zomcon built security systems

23
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:21,975
like the perimeter fence
that encloses our towns

24
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,312
in a wall of protective steel,

25
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:28,148
and surrounds other towns
right across this great land.

26
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:31,553
But even within the fence,
danger lurked.

27
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:36,493
Lingering radiation meant that anyone
who died became a zombie.

28
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:38,496
Be careful, Mrs. Smith.

29
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:41,465
He's not the man you married.

30
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:43,661
And then, a breakthrough...

31
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,829
the domestication collar.

32
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:49,170
With the collar in place,
a red light comes on,

33
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:53,507
telling us that the zombie's desire for
human flesh has been contained,

34
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:58,516
making the zombie as gentle
as a household pet.

35
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:02,850
But if the collar light
goes out, call Zomcon,

36
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:05,516
or push the nearest
safety button

37
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:09,061
and we'll be there
to handle any zombie problem,

38
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:11,756
large or small.

39
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:19,871
Thanks to Zomcon, we can all become
productive members of society,

40
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:23,875
even after we die.

41
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,036
Or, for those who can afford it,

42
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:29,547
a Zomcon funeral,
complete with head coffin,

43
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:33,881
guarantees you a burial
you won't come back from.

44
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,888
Your tax dollars
allow Zomcon new ways

45
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,720
to protect our homeland
from the zombie threat,

46
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:43,990
giving us more time to relax
and be with our families.

47
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:49,400
So thank you, Zomcon,
for winning the Zombie Wars

48
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:51,561
and building a company
for tomorrow

49
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:54,731
that gives us a safer
future today.

50
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:59,972
Zomcon, a better life
through containment.

51
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,423
Well, I think
that informative film

52
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,425
taught us all a little bit more
about how Zomcon

53
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,256
helps make our world
a better place,

54
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:17,590
isn't that right, children?

55
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:20,928
Yes, Miss Mills.

56
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,092
Our special guest is here.

57
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,601
Everyone straighten your desks.

58
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,100
Children, I would like to introduce

59
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,371
Willard's new head of security
at Zomcon,

60
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:35,777
who is not only a decorated hero of
the Zombie Wars,

61
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:39,340
but is also Zomcon's
official safety expert.

62
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,783
Mr. Bottoms is the father
of our newest,

63
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:46,791
and I suspect our brightest student, Cindy.

64
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:53,294
Well, good afternoon,
boys and girls.

65
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:57,631
So how many of you have ever had
to kill a zombie?

66
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:00,229
Ooh. Not too many,

67
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,138
and that's the way I'd like to keep it.

68
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:07,145
My job at Zomcon is to make things safe
for young people just like you.

69
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:10,148
That's why I'm building
a taller fence,

70
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:14,152
and there are going to be
new safety vans patrolling our streets.

71
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:17,655
And we're going to take
everybody's picture

72
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:20,317
just in case one of you...
gets lost.

73
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,724
What do you think of that?

74
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:28,958
Children, does anyone
have a question for Mr. Bottoms?

75
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:30,228
Yes, Roy.

76
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:33,499
Stan and me...
I mean, me and Stan,

77
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,904
have been Zomcon Cadets
for two years, sir.

78
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:38,000
We think Zomcon's great.

79
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,908
That's terrific. Thank you.

80
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:43,176
Does anyone have
an actual question?

81
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,386
Timmy Robinson has a question.

82
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:50,513
Timmy, go on.

83
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:51,851
Ask a good question.

84
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,092
Timmy?

85
00:04:57,196 --> 00:05:01,223
Are zombies dead or alive?

86
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:04,531
- What a stupid question.
- Really stupid.

87
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:09,540
Now, now, now.
There's no such thing as a stupid question.

88
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:13,544
The truth is, to some people,
zombies might seem human.

89
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:15,113
But make no mistake,

90
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:17,546
these creatures have
only one goal,

91
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,210
and that is to eat your flesh.

92
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,222
So without Zomcon,
we'd all be dead.

93
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,916
And then where would we be?

94
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:27,925
- Dead?
- Dead?

95
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:29,961
That's right.

96
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:31,928
So does that answer
your question, Timmy?

97
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,828
I guess.

98
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:35,230
You guess?

99
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,895
Well, this isn't a world
where we guess, young man.

100
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,835
You either know
something or you don't.

101
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:42,908
I was just thinking
about the zombies

102
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,910
who were buried too deep
to get out of their coffins.

103
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:48,913
Well, that's impossible.
We always bury the heads separately.

104
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:52,507
I mean people buried
before the space dust.

105
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:55,416
Couldn't some of them
still be in the graveyard right now,

106
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,250
trying to claw their way out?

107
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,757
Yuck.

108
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:07,259
Well, children, look at that.

109
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:10,097
It's time for outdoor education.

110
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:13,070
Let's show Mr. Bottoms
how good we are, hmm?

111
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,602
# In the brain
and not the chest #

112
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,438
# Head shots are the very best #

113
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,603
# In the brain
and not the chest #

114
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:23,443
# Head shots are the very best #

115
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:26,279
# In the brain
and not the chest #

116
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,854
# Head shots are the very best #

117
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:08,787
Trying to make
Zomcon look stupid?

118
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:10,226
That wouldn't be hard.

119
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:11,796
What did you say?

120
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:12,887
Nothing.

121
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:15,399
- Okay, mister.
- But it's out of bullets!

122
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,338
It felt empty.

123
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:25,343
A good cadet always knows
how many bullets he has left, son.

124
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,844
- You idiot.
- That's it.

125
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,004
Detention, the pair of you.

126
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,344
That's not fair.

127
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:34,011
But he said Zomcon was stupid.

128
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,020
Did you say that?

129
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,407
No, no.

130
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,568
Pick up the box.

131
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,144
Don't drop...

132
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:35,077
That's Mr. Bottoms' lamp.

133
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,739
If that could go to the den.

134
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,749
It's just to your right...

135
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,820
It's very fragile.

136
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,186
Hey, Timmy!

137
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:54,323
Hi, Mr. Theopolis.

138
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,200
That's no way to treat a bicycle.

139
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:08,610
Sorry, Mrs. Henderson.

140
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:11,945
What have I told you about
leaving you bike on the lawn?

141
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,382
Now put it away properly.

142
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,485
Was that so hard?

143
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,115
Yes, Mrs. Henderson.

144
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,454
What did you say?

145
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,155
I mean, no, Mrs. Henderson.

146
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,999
What are you looking at,
Theopolis?

147
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:41,471
I'm going to take this apple pie
over to our new neighbors.

148
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,141
See if they actually
own all those zombies.

149
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,808
They probably do.

150
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:48,148
He's the new
head of security at Zomcon.

151
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:51,519
The new head of security
moved into the Johnsons' old place.

152
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:55,993
Well, that's good news.

153
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,825
What on earth, Timmy?

154
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,331
That is a new shirt.

155
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,834
It was those bullies
I told you about.

156
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:07,201
They pushed me down,
and Stan pointed his gun at me.

157
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:08,830
What?

158
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:11,000
Did people see you like this?

159
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,374
I don't know.

160
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,771
Come here.

161
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:21,352
There you go.
Everything's going to be fine.

162
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:25,185
Just go and clean up,
put on a new shirt,

163
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,260
and we won't even have to
talk about those bullies.

164
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:38,270
Oh, there's one other thing.

165
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,642
Hi, honey.

166
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:26,147
Made just the way you like it.

167
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:30,583
A three olive martini.

168
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,557
What did I do to deserve this?

169
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:41,424
Helen, what are you up to?

170
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:44,094
I've had a long day.

171
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,933
Oh, Bill, honestly.
Sometimes I wonder about you.

172
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,269
I really do.

173
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,605
If you must know,

174
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,679
I have a surprise for you.

175
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,580
Wow.

176
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:04,951
Hi, Dad.

177
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:07,283
Hiya, Tim.

178
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,485
- How's my boy?
- Fine.

179
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:10,789
- Are you ready?
- There's more?

180
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:13,421
Now, just relax.

181
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:34,314
Isn't it wonderful?

182
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,888
Now we're not the only ones
on the street without one.

183
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:56,207
Helen, could I speak to you
in the kitchen?

184
00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:59,106
Of course, dear.
You're always so sensible.

185
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:04,342
Timmy, why don't you
go watch some television?

186
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,508
Yeah, but, Mom, I don't...

187
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,415
I'm sure there's
something wonderful on.

188
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,019
But, Bill, the neighbors.

189
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,188
Everybody has one except for us.

190
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:22,529
Well, Helen, in India
everyone has a tiger.

191
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,535
Why don't we just move there
and get a tiger?

192
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:27,037
Not everybody in India
has a tiger, Bill.

193
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,436
That's what I heard.

194
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:31,203
We can't afford a zombie.

195
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,370
I'm barely keeping up with
funeral payments as it is.

196
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,710
Funerals. Is that all you ever
think about, Bill?

197
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:40,047
I still can't believe you bought
a funeral savings plan for Timmy.

198
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:41,915
Come on, Helen.

199
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:44,046
The other kids hate him.

200
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:45,885
You said so yourself.

201
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,788
Bill!

202
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:52,062
I met our new neighbors today.

203
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:56,567
Did you know that he is the new head
of security for Zomcon?

204
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,569
Really?

205
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,901
That's who moved into
the old Johnson place?

206
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:08,242
Uh-huh. And did you know
that they have six zombies. Six!

207
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,406
And when his wife asked me
how many we had,

208
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:14,077
I didn't know what to say.

209
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:15,915
So I told her we had one.

210
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,079
You what?

211
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:18,247
What was I supposed to do?

212
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:21,019
Tell her that my husband
is afraid of zombies?

213
00:14:21,126 --> 00:14:23,356
I'm not going to talk about this.

214
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,871
Hey.

215
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:40,946
Zombie?

216
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:47,344
The roast.

217
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:07,462
- Dad.
- Sorry.

218
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:10,371
I thought that was
a different button.

219
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:14,303
Whoops.

220
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,278
What are you doing?
It's hurting him.

221
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:18,816
Sorry. I...

222
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,648
You know,
I bet with our new neighbor,

223
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,984
we'll have the safest
street in Willard.

224
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,614
I can't argue with that.

225
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:28,659
And, obviously,
it will be chained up

226
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,490
in the backyard
when it's not doing chores.

227
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,564
Obviously.

228
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:35,498
It'll have to be.

229
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,831
Helen, propriety.

230
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,404
You're the boss, dear.

231
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:56,520
Afraid of zombies.

232
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:59,022
I'll tell you what
I'm afraid of, little lady.

233
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,217
Nothing, that's what.

234
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:06,586
Just stay right there.

235
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,203
Think I'm afraid of you?

236
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:18,708
Huh?

237
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,938
That what you think?

238
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:25,283
That's right.

239
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:34,622
That's right.

240
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,335
Nicely done, Tammy.

241
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,514
No.

242
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:44,028
Grandpa's fallen
and he's getting up.

243
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:52,631
The elderly.

244
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:55,468
They seem friendly enough,
but can you really trust them?

245
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:56,506
No.

246
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:58,303
So don't get caught off guard.

247
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:01,140
Buy the Zomcon Zombie Alert
heart monitor.

248
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:04,044
When the heart stops, we start.

249
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:22,199
Aren't you going to
help me practice, Dad?

250
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:24,394
Oh, is that today?

251
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:26,994
You already changed it
from yesterday.

252
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:30,166
But I've already got
the driving range booked.

253
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:33,142
Don't other dads take their kids
to the driving range?

254
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:38,344
No.

255
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,747
No, they don't.

256
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:53,189
Honey, honey.

257
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:55,357
Please don't play
baseball by yourself.

258
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,094
It makes you look Ionely.

259
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,203
Now, I'm going over to meet
our new neighbors.

260
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:01,932
But you said you already
met the neighbors.

261
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,804
Timmy, I thought
you were on my side.

262
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,126
Give it here.

263
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:30,393
Come on, stupid. Throw it.

264
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,026
It's a baseball.

265
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:34,037
You throw it.

266
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,812
You throw like a girl.

267
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,453
Did it again.

268
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:34,157
It's so dumb.

269
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:35,631
Ow!

270
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:36,792
What are you doing?

271
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,130
It wasn't me.

272
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,205
You shot me with a B.B. Gun.

273
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:45,136
Get him!

274
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,850
So, where do you want
to get shot?

275
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:55,647
Head shot, Roy.

276
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:58,314
That's the first smart thing
you've said all day.

277
00:20:58,423 --> 00:20:59,890
- Roy!
- Leave me alone!

278
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:02,722
Ow, my arm.

279
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:04,386
My arm.

280
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,665
Stay away from me.

281
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:11,497
Stop, zombie! Stop!

282
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,400
Let's get out of here.

283
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:27,684
And that loser Stan,

284
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,686
I thought he was
going to pee himself.

285
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:33,189
Crying like a sucky baby.

286
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:36,853
They sure won't
pick on me again...

287
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,930
at least not when you're around.

288
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,694
What?

289
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:47,032
Do you want to play?

290
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,436
Okay.

291
00:21:55,981 --> 00:22:00,008
We should get a name for you
before Mom does.

292
00:22:00,118 --> 00:22:02,712
I know.

293
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,288
How about Fido?

294
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,964
Nice catch, Fido.

295
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:22,902
Well, if you're not going to catch it,

296
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,306
you got to go fetch it.

297
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,639
Go get it, boy.

298
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,080
Come on, boy.

299
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:36,916
You're disgusting.

300
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:38,990
Why don't you go home
and get some clothes on?

301
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,821
If your mother could see you now.

302
00:22:44,963 --> 00:22:46,692
Can't bear to look at you.

303
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,440
You rotten zombie!

304
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:03,412
You nearly scared me half to death.

305
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:04,641
Stop that!

306
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,947
You're spoiling my quiet time!

307
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:24,967
Fido?

308
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,298
Hello?

309
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:30,200
Oh, jeez.

310
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:33,639
Fido!

311
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:53,731
Stupid collar.

312
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:59,165
That's Mrs. Henderson.

313
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,569
What am I supposed
to tell Mom and Dad?

314
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:09,508
You're not supposed to
even be off your leash.

315
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:11,445
Dad's going to kill me.

316
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:14,417
Come on.
I got to get you cleaned up.

317
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:42,473
Hi, Cindy.

318
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:45,049
My mom and your mom
think we should be friends.

319
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,778
Oh.

320
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:48,853
Sorry.

321
00:24:48,954 --> 00:24:50,717
That's okay. I don't mind.

322
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:53,222
Well, bye.

323
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:58,660
You're not allowed to have a zombie
without a leash.

324
00:24:58,763 --> 00:24:59,730
You're a kid.

325
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:02,197
I don't care about
stupid Zomcon rules.

326
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:06,963
Here comes my dad,
and he sure cares.

327
00:25:17,382 --> 00:25:20,112
- Hello, Tommy.
- It's Timmy.

328
00:25:20,218 --> 00:25:22,152
Right you are, sweetheart.

329
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,781
Is that blood on your zombie?

330
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:31,690
Uh, it was a nosebleed.

331
00:25:31,796 --> 00:25:34,094
Well, that's not a fresh zombie.

332
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:36,497
Only fresh zombies bleed, son.

333
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:38,930
I meant my nose.

334
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:42,097
How did blood from your nose
get on to your zombie, then?

335
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:44,266
I wiped it there.

336
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:46,772
Daddy, can we go now?

337
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:49,438
I can't be late for
my first ballet class.

338
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:52,108
All right, princess.
Get in. Come on.

339
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:56,085
Okay. Bye, Timmy.

340
00:25:56,187 --> 00:25:57,677
I hate ballet.

341
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:13,863
I think we're in trouble, boy.

342
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:29,418
Hmm.
Heart attack, eh?

343
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:32,718
My grandpa had a heart attack.

344
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:43,325
You're not so bad, are you, boy?

345
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:46,097
Too bad you had to go
and eat Mrs. Henderson.

346
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:52,672
- I don't even want to ask.
- He got dirty.

347
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:55,007
And how on earth did he get dirty?

348
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:57,513
We were just in the park...

349
00:26:57,616 --> 00:27:02,576
What were you doing
in the park with the zombie?

350
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:10,189
You stupid zombie.

351
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:13,696
Look at what you've done.

352
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:16,699
I'll never get it cleaned up in time,

353
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:19,201
and in your father's garage!

354
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,363
You're not allowed in here.
You know that, Timmy.

355
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,634
Mom, when we were
in the park...

356
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:26,040
Timmy, are you listening to me?

357
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:29,045
Your father is going to
send the zombie back.

358
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:31,377
No, Dad always does
what you say.

359
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:34,213
No, not this time.

360
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:36,048
Not with a zombie.

361
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:39,021
And then what are
people going to say?

362
00:27:39,124 --> 00:27:42,218
They're going to say

363
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:44,727
that the Robinsons are strange,

364
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:46,296
and they're going to be right.

365
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,664
It's nothing, Mom.

366
00:27:50,769 --> 00:27:53,237
We'll clean this mess up.

367
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:54,532
Dad won't even know.

368
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,400
I promise.

369
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:03,914
What was so important that
you needed to tell me, Timmy?

370
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:06,745
Um, it's Fido.

371
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:08,682
He protected me
from the bullies.

372
00:28:08,787 --> 00:28:10,982
Fido? Who's Fido?

373
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:16,721
Fido.

374
00:28:16,828 --> 00:28:19,422
What kind of
a stupid name is Fido?

375
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,761
Who names their zombie, anyway?

376
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:24,096
Lots of people name
their zombies.

377
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:27,433
Mr. Theopolis has a name for his.

378
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:30,770
I bet he does.

379
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:35,778
At any rate,
zombies don't have heart attacks.

380
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,940
No, I mean before,

381
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,950
when he was alive.

382
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:44,681
That's what killed him,
like Grandpa.

383
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:53,360
What...

384
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,673
You know you're not
supposed to talk about your grandfather.

385
00:29:02,774 --> 00:29:04,799
Sorry.

386
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:05,967
I forgot.

387
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:08,477
Well, that's quite a thing to forget.

388
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:18,086
And she's missing since this morning?

389
00:29:18,189 --> 00:29:20,623
Well, she's always
wandering off on her own.

390
00:29:20,725 --> 00:29:21,987
I'm sure she'll turn up.

391
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:25,893
Mr. Henderson should have put her
in a retirement home years ago.

392
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:27,828
Really, Bill!

393
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:31,265
What would Francis do without her?
He'd be all alone.

394
00:29:31,369 --> 00:29:34,668
Those homes are very comfortable
and... secure.

395
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:38,334
They're only secure because
they use the old prison.

396
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:46,280
Well... she is over 65, Helen,

397
00:29:46,384 --> 00:29:49,046
and old people can't be trusted.

398
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:50,451
Isn't that right?

399
00:29:50,555 --> 00:29:53,581
Yeah, we had a lot of trouble
with old people during the war.

400
00:29:53,691 --> 00:29:54,919
Jonathan, please.

401
00:29:55,026 --> 00:29:58,154
He never gets tired of talking about
that dreadful war.

402
00:29:59,664 --> 00:30:00,995
You must have been, what, 10?

403
00:30:02,233 --> 00:30:03,427
Uh... 11.

404
00:30:03,535 --> 00:30:05,025
Any kills?

405
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:08,162
Just... one.

406
00:30:09,674 --> 00:30:11,869
Someone close to home?

407
00:30:13,378 --> 00:30:15,369
It was his father.

408
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:19,041
But you're fine now, aren't you, honey?

409
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,310
Yep.

410
00:30:20,418 --> 00:30:23,251
Well, you did what
you had to, Robinson.

411
00:30:23,354 --> 00:30:25,879
It's a terrible thing,
the Zombie War.

412
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:28,618
Families having to kill their own.

413
00:30:28,726 --> 00:30:30,421
Never lose sight of that.

414
00:30:30,528 --> 00:30:32,621
I'd take Dee Dee's head off
in a second if I had to.

415
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:36,790
He always says that.

416
00:30:36,901 --> 00:30:39,335
Don't let 'em get too close.

417
00:30:39,437 --> 00:30:42,406
It makes it harder to pull the trigger.

418
00:30:52,884 --> 00:30:55,284
Well, that went well.

419
00:30:57,222 --> 00:30:58,814
What is it, Timmy?

420
00:30:58,923 --> 00:31:02,757
I just hope a zombie
didn't get Mrs. Henderson.

421
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:04,260
What a thing to say.

422
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:08,093
Well, what if somebody's
zombie did attack her?

423
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,291
What then?

424
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,028
Well, we all remember
what happened to the Johnsons

425
00:31:12,136 --> 00:31:14,696
when their zombie
ate those Christmas carolers.

426
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:17,604
Did Zomcon really chuck them
into the Wild Zone?

427
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:20,269
That's probably how
the Bottoms got their house.

428
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:21,504
Bill.

429
00:31:21,613 --> 00:31:24,980
Let's just say there's a very good reason
we don't have prisons anymore.

430
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:26,243
Bill.

431
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:29,013
Well, Helen,
he's gotta learn someday.

432
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,111
Can't keep denying it.

433
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:35,591
Timmy, I think it's nice that you're
caring so much about Mrs. Henderson.

434
00:31:35,693 --> 00:31:37,991
But I think she's gonna be just fine.

435
00:32:06,891 --> 00:32:10,019
Come here.
Come on! Come on!

436
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:12,494
Come on. No more mistakes
on Daddy's rug.

437
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:16,089
No, no, no. We're not going anywhere
until you do your business.

438
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,667
Spike, come here.

439
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,737
You're being a naughty boy
tonight, huh?

440
00:32:19,837 --> 00:32:23,637
Why are you being such a naughty boy
tonight, huh?

441
00:33:05,616 --> 00:33:07,516
Oh, no.

442
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:18,992
Stay away, Mrs. Henderson.

443
00:33:41,586 --> 00:33:43,611
Sorry, Mrs. Henderson.

444
00:33:57,035 --> 00:34:00,198
You weren't very nice,
Mrs. Henderson.

445
00:34:00,304 --> 00:34:02,738
But I'm really sorry you're dead.

446
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,274
Now you're in a garden.

447
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:07,844
You always liked plants.

448
00:34:07,945 --> 00:34:10,106
So I hope that's okay.

449
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:57,358
Shh. You'll wake up
Mom and Dad.

450
00:35:00,331 --> 00:35:03,596
Fido?

451
00:35:03,701 --> 00:35:06,363
Oh, no. Your collar.

452
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:09,898
Hey, Timmy?

453
00:35:10,007 --> 00:35:12,441
Zombie troubles?

454
00:35:17,515 --> 00:35:20,040
Okay.
Now, Tammy.

455
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:22,619
All right.

456
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,914
Okay.

457
00:35:26,657 --> 00:35:27,749
It's okay, boy.

458
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,084
Hey!

459
00:35:30,194 --> 00:35:32,059
You trying to get yourself killed?

460
00:35:32,163 --> 00:35:33,596
No.

461
00:35:33,698 --> 00:35:34,892
Let me tell you something.

462
00:35:34,999 --> 00:35:38,230
I've had some pretty
close calls with my Tammy.

463
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:40,634
Lookee here.

464
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:43,070
You want that?

465
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:50,709
Not the teeth, Tammy.
Not the teeth, Tammy.

466
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:52,407
Good girl.

467
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:53,882
She looks good for a zombie.

468
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:56,180
Same as the day I met her.

469
00:35:56,287 --> 00:36:00,690
She was shopping in the grocery store
for candy corn with her mom.

470
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:02,588
Had some kind of
a brain aneurysm.

471
00:36:02,693 --> 00:36:06,720
They slapped a collar on her before
she even hit the floor.

472
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:09,732
Got her before there was
any decomposition.

473
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:12,132
Where'd you get all this stuff?

474
00:36:12,236 --> 00:36:15,330
Part of my severance package
when I quit Zomcon.

475
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:19,942
Hey!
Will you look at that?

476
00:36:20,044 --> 00:36:22,239
Watch this.

477
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:23,574
Here you go, Sparky.

478
00:36:28,452 --> 00:36:31,046
You used to be a smoker, boy?

479
00:36:31,155 --> 00:36:32,281
Old habits die hard.

480
00:36:35,426 --> 00:36:37,451
You wanna rip
my face off, don't you.

481
00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:40,895
Oh, yes.

482
00:36:40,998 --> 00:36:43,364
You wanna eat me for dinner.

483
00:36:43,467 --> 00:36:46,095
How come zombies wanna eat people?

484
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:48,798
You know...

485
00:36:48,906 --> 00:36:50,601
I don't know.

486
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:54,508
Geiger used to say it was their way
of trying to come back to life.

487
00:36:54,612 --> 00:36:56,978
Would that work?

488
00:36:58,516 --> 00:37:00,313
Not a chance.

489
00:37:00,418 --> 00:37:03,285
He was a strange bird, Geiger.

490
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:06,288
I think that when
his wife went zombie,

491
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:09,120
he couldn't stand the thought
of losing her.

492
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:12,253
That's why he invented the collar
in the first place.

493
00:37:13,631 --> 00:37:15,223
Okay.

494
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:17,426
Go ahead, Tammy.

495
00:37:21,973 --> 00:37:23,463
Now...

496
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:26,270
not a word of this to anyone.

497
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:29,346
Not your mom, not your dad.

498
00:37:29,447 --> 00:37:31,608
This will be our little secret...

499
00:37:31,716 --> 00:37:34,014
or it's free lawn mowing for a year.

500
00:37:34,118 --> 00:37:35,380
Yes, sir.

501
00:38:20,531 --> 00:38:23,762
Much better. There you go.

502
00:38:27,104 --> 00:38:28,867
Is that Dad's suit?

503
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:31,134
Yes.

504
00:38:31,242 --> 00:38:33,267
And we don't need to
mention it to your father.

505
00:38:33,377 --> 00:38:34,708
He won't even notice.

506
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:36,006
You look great, boy.

507
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:43,878
Not bad at all.

508
00:38:47,425 --> 00:38:49,620
Hurry, your father's waiting.

509
00:38:49,727 --> 00:38:50,887
Do we have to go?

510
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:52,690
These Sunday drives are
very important to your father.

511
00:38:52,797 --> 00:38:55,459
How would it look if we didn't
go together as a family?

512
00:38:55,566 --> 00:38:57,591
But it's weird.

513
00:38:57,702 --> 00:38:59,795
We never know anybody.

514
00:38:59,904 --> 00:39:01,701
Well, maybe this time we will.

515
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:34,761
Oh, I love this park.
It's so peaceful.

516
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:42,812
Come here, puppy.
Come on.

517
00:39:42,913 --> 00:39:44,710
Come have some cheese.

518
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:47,247
Have some cheese.

519
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:02,099
They seem, in the view
of the foolish, to be dead.

520
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:04,895
And their passing away
was part of affliction,

521
00:40:05,002 --> 00:40:07,664
and their going forth
from us utter destruction.

522
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:10,502
But they are in peace.

523
00:40:10,608 --> 00:40:13,839
For if before men indeed
they be punished...

524
00:40:13,944 --> 00:40:16,742
Is that zombie wearing my suit?

525
00:40:16,847 --> 00:40:19,247
What would you suggest, Bill?
That I buy him a new one?

526
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:21,375
Why didn't you leave him
the way he was?

527
00:40:21,485 --> 00:40:23,612
They way he was dressed?
Come on, Bill.

528
00:40:25,556 --> 00:40:26,921
Head coffin, please.

529
00:40:33,898 --> 00:40:35,331
Head coffin.

530
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,901
This guy's not coming back,
you can bet on that.

531
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:39,333
Shh.

532
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,234
Look. This is the best part.

533
00:40:41,338 --> 00:40:44,432
Emmitt Mitchell,
from dust have you come

534
00:40:44,542 --> 00:40:46,339
and to dust shall you return...

535
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:50,642
...and from dust shall
you not be resurrected.

536
00:41:01,025 --> 00:41:06,156
So if a person dies
and becomes a zombie,

537
00:41:06,263 --> 00:41:09,198
then they're not really dead.

538
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,599
No, not really.

539
00:41:12,703 --> 00:41:14,500
Well...

540
00:41:14,605 --> 00:41:18,439
it's like being in purgatory
before going to heaven.

541
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:21,340
What is your father doing?

542
00:41:21,445 --> 00:41:25,176
So... zombies are sinners?

543
00:41:27,251 --> 00:41:30,243
L... I suppose
we're all sinners, honey.

544
00:41:30,354 --> 00:41:33,551
But God sees
the good in everyone.

545
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:37,354
God loves zombies, too?
Even when they kill?

546
00:41:37,461 --> 00:41:41,693
Well, l... I think zombies kill
because it's their nature.

547
00:41:41,799 --> 00:41:43,596
So then it's not their fault.

548
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:45,692
No, not really.

549
00:41:45,803 --> 00:41:48,203
What are you so happy about?

550
00:41:48,305 --> 00:41:50,239
I was just gonna
tell you something.

551
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:52,138
You know what Herman
the gravedigger just told me?

552
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:54,905
- Bill, Timmy was...
- Only 10% of people get funerals.

553
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:58,004
Most become zombies.
Can you believe that?

554
00:41:58,115 --> 00:42:01,278
Well, they are expensive.

555
00:42:01,385 --> 00:42:03,649
I'd rather be a zombie than dead.

556
00:42:03,754 --> 00:42:05,381
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on there!

557
00:42:05,489 --> 00:42:07,423
Timmy is making observations
about the world.

558
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:08,583
I think it's healthy.

559
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:11,092
Observation about the world?

560
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:12,628
He's a kid.
What does he know?

561
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:14,391
He knows a lot.

562
00:42:14,498 --> 00:42:17,092
At least he's not
obsessed with funerals.

563
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:19,396
Better than focusing
on walking corpses...

564
00:42:19,503 --> 00:42:21,562
who should be buried...

565
00:42:21,672 --> 00:42:23,162
without their heads.

566
00:42:26,744 --> 00:42:28,302
Hey!

567
00:42:28,412 --> 00:42:30,073
We're all getting funerals.

568
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:32,205
All three of us!

569
00:42:32,316 --> 00:42:36,309
Bill, get your own funeral.

570
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:39,719
Timmy and I are going zombie.

571
00:42:53,037 --> 00:42:54,595
Would you look at that?

572
00:42:54,705 --> 00:42:58,334
Zomcon at the Hendersons'.

573
00:42:58,442 --> 00:43:00,774
I wonder why they're
taking Francis away.

574
00:43:00,878 --> 00:43:03,904
He probably gave her
an illegal funeral...

575
00:43:04,014 --> 00:43:06,039
without a permit.

576
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:07,481
Is that bad?

577
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:08,711
Oh, yes.

578
00:43:14,959 --> 00:43:16,187
Oh, dear!

579
00:43:16,293 --> 00:43:18,454
This is how it always starts.

580
00:43:18,562 --> 00:43:20,291
Oh, Bill.

581
00:43:20,397 --> 00:43:23,025
One wild zombie, Helen.
That's all it takes.

582
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:45,916
Hey, that's the schoolteacher.

583
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,923
Any sign of the old lady?

584
00:43:52,663 --> 00:43:55,097
God, I hate old people!

585
00:43:56,867 --> 00:43:59,427
I'll be right back.

586
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,768
It's just water, boy.
Come on!

587
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:10,375
You missed a spot.

588
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:04,459
Hi, boys.

589
00:45:04,568 --> 00:45:06,536
Hi, Mom.

590
00:45:06,637 --> 00:45:09,435
I thought you two might be thirsty.

591
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:16,612
Timmy! Timmy!
Don't be cruel.

592
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:20,941
Timmy!

593
00:45:25,089 --> 00:45:26,522
What's going on?

594
00:45:26,623 --> 00:45:29,854
I was just bringing
the boys something to drink.

595
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:32,019
Zombies don't drink, Helen.

596
00:45:32,129 --> 00:45:34,290
Yes, they can, Bill.
They just don't have to.

597
00:45:35,833 --> 00:45:37,391
We can pretend, can't we?

598
00:45:37,501 --> 00:45:39,662
It doesn't hurt anybody, does it?

599
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:41,465
Hey!

600
00:45:43,373 --> 00:45:44,533
Give me that.

601
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:53,076
This is detail work.

602
00:45:53,183 --> 00:45:57,950
It needs to be done delicately
if you're gonna protect the finish.

603
00:45:58,055 --> 00:45:59,750
That's why they call it
"a man's job."

604
00:45:59,857 --> 00:46:02,883
Flesh-eating maniacs
need not apply.

605
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:12,329
Hey, Helen.

606
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:14,063
Floyd.

607
00:46:14,171 --> 00:46:16,071
Hey, get a move on, Robinson.

608
00:46:17,908 --> 00:46:19,341
Um...

609
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:23,406
Why don't you...
stay with us today,

610
00:46:23,514 --> 00:46:25,778
and we can be a family?

611
00:46:25,883 --> 00:46:27,180
Besides, you don't even like Floyd.

612
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:29,047
You told me yourself.

613
00:46:29,153 --> 00:46:31,144
I said Floyd cheats at golf.

614
00:46:31,255 --> 00:46:33,621
I didn't say I didn't like him.

615
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:37,424
Bill...

616
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:42,398
I have a secret to tell you.

617
00:46:42,499 --> 00:46:45,730
You... You're all wet, Helen.

618
00:46:48,172 --> 00:46:50,163
I only had one rule.

619
00:46:50,274 --> 00:46:51,468
Which rule was that?

620
00:46:51,575 --> 00:46:53,736
Very funny, mister.

621
00:46:53,844 --> 00:46:55,709
Get this zombie chained up.

622
00:46:58,949 --> 00:47:00,314
Now!

623
00:47:15,399 --> 00:47:17,492
Bye, honey!

624
00:47:28,278 --> 00:47:30,610
Now what is that?

625
00:47:30,714 --> 00:47:33,842
This is her walker... thingy, sir.

626
00:47:33,951 --> 00:47:37,148
At least that's what our witnesses say.

627
00:47:38,422 --> 00:47:42,324
We caught these two in the bushes
firing their.22s at the wild zombies.

628
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:44,926
The little one?

629
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:47,019
Shot Dougie in the leg.

630
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,668
Get that out of sight, will ya?

631
00:47:55,339 --> 00:47:57,364
It's a boot. Put it back.

632
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:00,203
So let me get this straight.

633
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:04,076
You're saying that the Robinson zombie
tried to eat you

634
00:48:04,181 --> 00:48:07,150
and then moved on
to Mrs. Henderson.

635
00:48:07,251 --> 00:48:08,684
Is that right?

636
00:48:08,785 --> 00:48:11,049
Yes, sir.

637
00:48:11,154 --> 00:48:14,055
Well, I don't see any bite marks.

638
00:48:14,157 --> 00:48:16,557
Well, he actually didn't
try to bite us.

639
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:18,287
Shut up, Stan!

640
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:20,090
He broke my arm.

641
00:48:20,197 --> 00:48:21,562
Do you know what I think?

642
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:28,233
I think that you shot the old lady
just like, uh...

643
00:48:28,338 --> 00:48:29,771
just like you shot
Dougie over there.

644
00:48:29,873 --> 00:48:34,708
No way! It's all
Timmy Robinson's fault.

645
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:42,950
You got nothing
to worry about now, boy.

646
00:48:43,053 --> 00:48:44,680
Dad loves ya!

647
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:52,152
Come on!

648
00:48:53,664 --> 00:48:56,189
They'll never split us up, Fido! Ever!

649
00:48:57,301 --> 00:48:58,996
Whoo!

650
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:02,170
Come on, boy!

651
00:49:21,825 --> 00:49:25,158
That was fun, boy.

652
00:49:25,262 --> 00:49:26,661
Did you like swimming?

653
00:49:27,898 --> 00:49:30,924
You know,
I didn't even know you could swim.

654
00:49:34,438 --> 00:49:37,236
We gotta get you back
before Dad comes home.

655
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:44,047
Don't do anything, boy.

656
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:45,273
"Boy"?

657
00:49:45,382 --> 00:49:46,713
Let's just shoot him now, Roy.

658
00:49:47,951 --> 00:49:50,818
Nah. Let's stick to the plan.

659
00:49:53,557 --> 00:49:54,751
What are you doing?

660
00:49:54,858 --> 00:49:56,587
We're gonna be heroes.

661
00:49:56,693 --> 00:49:58,718
What... What are you
talking about?

662
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:00,729
We know your zombie
killed the old lady.

663
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:04,562
We told Bottoms, and he's gonna send
your whole family to the Wild Zone.

664
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:05,760
- What?
- Shut up, Stan!

665
00:50:05,869 --> 00:50:08,497
He would have believed us, too,
if you'd let me do the talking.

666
00:50:08,605 --> 00:50:11,597
- You're the one who blew it.
- Shut up! You're wrecking the fun.

667
00:50:11,708 --> 00:50:12,800
- I'm just saying...
- Shut up!

668
00:50:12,909 --> 00:50:15,275
- Roy, stop telling me...
- Shut up!

669
00:50:18,081 --> 00:50:19,378
Okay, Robinson...

670
00:50:19,483 --> 00:50:22,384
I'm gonna shoot him dead
just before he gets to you.

671
00:50:22,486 --> 00:50:23,976
I'm gonna save your life
from the zombie.

672
00:50:24,087 --> 00:50:25,281
He's gonna pay for everything.

673
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:28,921
Do it, Roy!

674
00:50:31,228 --> 00:50:33,287
Jeez, Roy! Blast him!

675
00:50:40,837 --> 00:50:43,169
Oh, crap! You made me
shoot my stupid brother!

676
00:51:16,873 --> 00:51:18,898
Oh, jeez!

677
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:27,474
Please don't eat me, Fido.

678
00:51:32,989 --> 00:51:35,184
I knew you wouldn't eat me, boy.

679
00:51:35,292 --> 00:51:37,123
I knew it.

680
00:51:37,227 --> 00:51:38,626
Hurry and untie me.

681
00:51:41,031 --> 00:51:44,467
You're right, boy.
It's not gonna work.

682
00:51:49,139 --> 00:51:51,232
You gotta go for help.

683
00:51:55,011 --> 00:51:56,808
You better clean up first.

684
00:52:01,017 --> 00:52:02,780
Quick, Fido.

685
00:52:02,886 --> 00:52:04,376
Please!

686
00:52:07,357 --> 00:52:10,190
Good boy!
That'll hold him.

687
00:52:15,098 --> 00:52:16,827
Now go get Mom.

688
00:52:18,368 --> 00:52:19,767
Fido, wait!

689
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:23,033
You promise not to eat Mom, right?

690
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:46,852
I got it!

691
00:52:46,963 --> 00:52:49,227
I got it! Stand aside.

692
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:51,562
- It's Joe Peterson.
- Not anymore he ain't.

693
00:52:53,904 --> 00:52:55,667
Well...

694
00:53:05,148 --> 00:53:06,945
Little rusty.

695
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:08,381
Okay.

696
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,449
Bull's-eye.

697
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:25,732
Hey.

698
00:53:25,835 --> 00:53:27,928
Nice shot.

699
00:53:34,978 --> 00:53:37,947
Goodness, Fido, you scared me.

700
00:53:41,418 --> 00:53:43,852
What is it?
Where's Timmy?

701
00:53:44,988 --> 00:53:46,421
What...

702
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:50,959
What...

703
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:54,087
Is something wrong?
Is Timmy in trouble?

704
00:54:06,843 --> 00:54:08,868
Please, someone help!

705
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:16,510
Which way, Fido?
Is this the right way?

706
00:54:18,989 --> 00:54:20,217
Hold on.

707
00:54:26,830 --> 00:54:29,799
Your collar!

708
00:54:39,042 --> 00:54:40,441
Why aren't you eating me?

709
00:54:43,847 --> 00:54:47,283
For goodness sake, Fido.

710
00:55:05,902 --> 00:55:07,961
Help!

711
00:55:08,071 --> 00:55:09,595
Which way now, Fido?

712
00:55:30,193 --> 00:55:31,854
Help! Help!

713
00:55:31,961 --> 00:55:33,553
Get away!

714
00:56:01,224 --> 00:56:02,555
Mom!

715
00:56:02,659 --> 00:56:04,354
Oh, Timmy!

716
00:56:05,395 --> 00:56:07,295
Thank God you're all right.

717
00:56:11,434 --> 00:56:13,299
God! Timmy!

718
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:19,497
You crazy wonderful zombie.

719
00:56:51,608 --> 00:56:53,599
You never saw this.

720
00:57:07,524 --> 00:57:10,857
They were zombies, and they
were going to kill you.

721
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:12,188
I know, Mom.

722
00:57:12,295 --> 00:57:13,660
I did what I had to do.

723
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:15,025
I know.

724
00:57:15,131 --> 00:57:19,830
And I don't want you thinking that what we did
is normal or okay in any way.

725
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:22,734
I don't.

726
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:53,732
- Nice shot.
- Thanks.

727
00:57:57,407 --> 00:57:59,807
It's so nice to see
Cindy with a friend.

728
00:57:59,909 --> 00:58:01,638
She doesn't have many?

729
00:58:01,744 --> 00:58:03,803
We're always moving.
It's...

730
00:58:03,913 --> 00:58:06,473
It's hard for any of us
to make friends.

731
00:58:06,583 --> 00:58:09,518
Jonathan seems
to like it that way.

732
00:58:09,619 --> 00:58:14,113
Bill's lived in Willard his entire life,
and he still doesn't have any friends.

733
00:58:14,224 --> 00:58:16,317
And he definitely likes it that way.

734
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:20,963
He must be excited
about the new baby.

735
00:58:22,465 --> 00:58:24,933
He hasn't even noticed.

736
00:58:25,034 --> 00:58:27,969
How could he not notice?

737
00:58:33,409 --> 00:58:35,138
You want another beer?

738
00:58:35,245 --> 00:58:37,509
I wouldn't say no.

739
00:58:37,614 --> 00:58:39,275
Dee Dee, get us a couple of
cold ones, will ya?

740
00:58:39,382 --> 00:58:40,747
Coming right up, dear.

741
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:44,547
Hey. You're not actually gonna get him
another beer, are you?

742
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:48,054
Get your own beer, Bill.

743
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:56,258
Come on. Let me
show you the war room.

744
00:59:20,490 --> 00:59:22,958
So that Helen of yours...

745
00:59:24,594 --> 00:59:27,825
What a live wire.

746
00:59:27,931 --> 00:59:30,991
"Get your own beer, Bill."

747
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:34,763
Makes you wonder what's going on
in that little head of hers.

748
00:59:34,871 --> 00:59:37,032
You can say that again.

749
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:40,504
My first kill.

750
00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:44,239
That is Uncle Bob.

751
00:59:46,916 --> 00:59:51,876
Now, I gather it was
Helen's idea to get a zombie.

752
00:59:51,988 --> 00:59:54,855
Yes, it was.

753
00:59:54,958 --> 00:59:57,586
She seems pretty friendly with it.

754
01:00:03,399 --> 01:00:05,424
What are you suggesting?

755
01:00:06,469 --> 01:00:09,632
Look, Robinson, when people
get attached to their zombies,

756
01:00:09,739 --> 01:00:12,299
it, uh... it only spells trouble.

757
01:00:12,408 --> 01:00:16,310
Trouble for me,
trouble for you...

758
01:00:16,412 --> 01:00:18,039
trouble for Mrs. Henderson.

759
01:00:19,782 --> 01:00:21,409
Mrs... Mrs. Henderson?

760
01:00:21,517 --> 01:00:23,007
Somebody's zombie got her.

761
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:24,586
Did they?

762
01:00:24,687 --> 01:00:28,214
Well, I don't know, Robinson.
Why don't you tell me.

763
01:00:30,026 --> 01:00:34,122
Chances are you know
a lot more than you think.

764
01:00:38,701 --> 01:00:40,430
Well, that was fun.

765
01:00:41,671 --> 01:00:44,139
Timmy, go to bed.

766
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:47,073
Helen, we have to talk.

767
01:00:47,176 --> 01:00:49,770
Oh, lighten up, Bill.

768
01:00:49,879 --> 01:00:51,346
Helen.

769
01:00:55,518 --> 01:00:59,113
I am trying to have a serious discussion
with you, Helen.

770
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:03,481
Turn that off, Helen!

771
01:01:04,761 --> 01:01:08,094
What is that damn zombie
doing in my E-Z Boy?

772
01:01:11,234 --> 01:01:13,429
Bill.

773
01:01:13,536 --> 01:01:16,130
We haven't danced
since our wedding night.

774
01:01:16,239 --> 01:01:18,104
This is hardly the time.

775
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:21,040
Come on, Bill.
Dance with me.

776
01:01:21,144 --> 01:01:22,805
I don't...

777
01:01:24,614 --> 01:01:26,673
Helen.

778
01:01:39,195 --> 01:01:41,322
That... is enough.

779
01:01:43,833 --> 01:01:46,859
Well, if you're not
gonna dance with me,

780
01:01:46,969 --> 01:01:49,199
I know someone who will.

781
01:02:28,444 --> 01:02:30,742
Bill! Bill!

782
01:02:37,186 --> 01:02:39,086
Nighty-night.

783
01:02:49,899 --> 01:02:52,697
I'm sorry about Bill.
He's...

784
01:02:52,802 --> 01:02:54,429
He's just...

785
01:03:02,245 --> 01:03:05,271
I wish I would have known you before.

786
01:03:07,683 --> 01:03:09,651
Before you died.

787
01:03:13,356 --> 01:03:15,051
Do you remember that?

788
01:03:38,981 --> 01:03:40,608
Can I see that?

789
01:03:49,859 --> 01:03:53,260
"Timmy... R."

790
01:04:33,336 --> 01:04:34,598
Fido?

791
01:04:38,441 --> 01:04:40,102
Fido!

792
01:04:48,751 --> 01:04:50,218
What are you doing with Fido?

793
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:54,915
Oh, I think we both know
what's gonna happen to Fido.

794
01:04:55,024 --> 01:04:57,219
No! You can't!

795
01:04:57,326 --> 01:04:59,317
He didn't do anything wrong!

796
01:04:59,428 --> 01:05:02,727
Well, maybe he didn't,
but you did.

797
01:05:02,832 --> 01:05:04,857
And because you made
friends with a zombie,

798
01:05:04,967 --> 01:05:08,801
a lot of nice people
in this neighborhood got killed.

799
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:12,068
You didn't think of that, did you?

800
01:05:14,110 --> 01:05:16,374
Timmy...

801
01:05:16,479 --> 01:05:21,439
do you know that I could
send you and your whole family

802
01:05:21,550 --> 01:05:25,281
to the Wild Zone
for what you've done?

803
01:05:25,388 --> 01:05:28,448
How do you think
I got the Johnson place?

804
01:05:28,557 --> 01:05:31,492
But I had a nice talk
with your parents,

805
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:34,620
and they assured me that nothing like this
would ever happen again.

806
01:05:34,730 --> 01:05:36,527
Isn't that right, Helen?

807
01:05:39,735 --> 01:05:41,202
Go to your room.

808
01:05:41,304 --> 01:05:43,135
Now.

809
01:05:49,578 --> 01:05:52,069
Yes, sir.

810
01:05:52,181 --> 01:05:56,208
These little problems are
all about containment.

811
01:06:58,981 --> 01:07:02,007
And Floyd hits this big slice into
the clubhouse,

812
01:07:02,118 --> 01:07:05,451
and the ball hits old man Patterson
right between the eyes.

813
01:07:05,554 --> 01:07:08,352
I thought we were gonna have
our first zombie golfer.

814
01:07:18,868 --> 01:07:23,635
How come they blame the bullies
for Mrs. Henderson getting killed?

815
01:07:26,542 --> 01:07:29,170
Well, we're just lucky to have a neighbor
like Mr. Bottoms.

816
01:07:29,278 --> 01:07:31,576
Your mother is right, Tim.

817
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:33,272
But Fido had to die.

818
01:07:33,382 --> 01:07:35,509
The bullies got blamed
for it anyways.

819
01:07:35,618 --> 01:07:38,018
Mom killed the bullies
and didn't tell anyone.

820
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:41,283
How come she didn't
get in trouble?

821
01:07:43,192 --> 01:07:46,821
Why... Why are we
talking about this?

822
01:07:46,929 --> 01:07:50,956
I thought we agreed we weren't gonna have
to talk about this!

823
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:53,058
Bill, where are you going?

824
01:08:02,211 --> 01:08:04,839
I loved Fido, too, you know.

825
01:08:04,947 --> 01:08:06,938
- You did?
- Yeah.

826
01:08:07,049 --> 01:08:09,347
Well...

827
01:08:09,452 --> 01:08:11,511
in a way I did.

828
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:14,145
Like Mr. Theopolis loves Tammy?

829
01:08:14,256 --> 01:08:16,019
No, he does not.

830
01:08:17,493 --> 01:08:20,553
Like a friend, Timmy.

831
01:08:20,663 --> 01:08:22,631
Just like that.

832
01:08:27,703 --> 01:08:32,333
You see, Timmy, the thing
about your dad...

833
01:08:32,441 --> 01:08:37,936
is that he is still
a part of this family.

834
01:08:38,047 --> 01:08:39,742
He is?

835
01:08:39,849 --> 01:08:43,546
Of course he is.

836
01:08:43,652 --> 01:08:47,110
Why would you say
something like that?

837
01:08:47,223 --> 01:08:49,657
I think he loves us.

838
01:08:49,758 --> 01:08:51,783
I do.

839
01:08:53,395 --> 01:08:55,659
I just think that
he's afraid to admit it.

840
01:08:59,401 --> 01:09:02,700
Dad, you just
passed the school.

841
01:09:03,839 --> 01:09:05,602
Oh.

842
01:09:05,708 --> 01:09:07,676
So I did.

843
01:09:12,047 --> 01:09:13,309
Bye, Dad.

844
01:09:13,415 --> 01:09:15,679
Uh, Timmy...

845
01:09:15,784 --> 01:09:17,251
uh...

846
01:09:17,353 --> 01:09:20,345
Look, l... I know it's hard.

847
01:09:23,259 --> 01:09:24,556
I understand.

848
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:26,127
You do?

849
01:09:26,228 --> 01:09:27,593
Sure I do.

850
01:09:27,696 --> 01:09:31,154
Look, son...

851
01:09:31,267 --> 01:09:33,531
I know when you're a kid,
you feel things.

852
01:09:33,636 --> 01:09:35,934
A lot of...

853
01:09:36,038 --> 01:09:37,528
things.

854
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:39,835
But you have to get over that.

855
01:09:39,942 --> 01:09:40,966
Get over what?

856
01:09:41,076 --> 01:09:42,600
Feelings.

857
01:09:43,479 --> 01:09:45,572
Feelings.

858
01:09:45,681 --> 01:09:48,514
Not important, okay?

859
01:09:48,617 --> 01:09:52,417
Being alive is what counts.

860
01:09:53,856 --> 01:09:55,756
Wait a minute. I got something.

861
01:10:01,463 --> 01:10:04,023
Go on. Open it.

862
01:10:09,138 --> 01:10:11,231
- It's a gun.
- Take it out.

863
01:10:19,481 --> 01:10:22,143
I know you're not supposed to have
a handgun...

864
01:10:22,251 --> 01:10:24,515
until you're 12...

865
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:28,283
but it can come in real handy.

866
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:31,086
What do you say?

867
01:10:31,193 --> 01:10:33,286
Thanks, Dad.

868
01:10:33,395 --> 01:10:35,886
This will just be between us.

869
01:10:35,998 --> 01:10:38,694
Keep it in your book bag.

870
01:10:38,801 --> 01:10:40,928
Don't forget the bullets.

871
01:10:46,008 --> 01:10:47,475
There you go.

872
01:10:49,211 --> 01:10:51,941
Have a good day, Tim.

873
01:10:54,016 --> 01:10:55,950
Bye, Dad.

874
01:11:10,332 --> 01:11:12,323
Bill?

875
01:11:14,069 --> 01:11:18,130
Do you think we did the right thing
sending Fido back?

876
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:22,370
I had a great chat with Tim today.

877
01:11:22,478 --> 01:11:25,914
I think everything is
gonna be just fine.

878
01:11:26,015 --> 01:11:27,482
Really?

879
01:11:27,583 --> 01:11:29,778
Absolutely.

880
01:11:41,764 --> 01:11:43,629
Bill, do you love me?

881
01:11:53,075 --> 01:11:54,474
I'm pregnant.

882
01:11:55,911 --> 01:11:57,344
Oh.

883
01:11:58,947 --> 01:12:02,906
I'm sure it's nothing.
You're just gaining a little weight.

884
01:12:09,391 --> 01:12:11,757
Helen.

885
01:12:14,596 --> 01:12:18,464
I just don't think on my salary
I can afford another funeral.

886
01:12:40,856 --> 01:12:43,984
- Are you sure?
- I heard Daddy on the phone.

887
01:12:44,093 --> 01:12:46,618
He said he never wastes
a good zombie.

888
01:12:46,729 --> 01:12:48,856
He's got him working the factory.

889
01:12:48,964 --> 01:12:50,864
Can you get us in there?

890
01:12:50,966 --> 01:12:53,434
Are you crazy?
My dad would kill me.

891
01:12:54,970 --> 01:12:57,165
No, I mean he really would kill me.

892
01:13:01,377 --> 01:13:03,402
But I know someone who can.

893
01:13:14,123 --> 01:13:17,217
Not the teeth, baby.
Good girl.

894
01:13:18,427 --> 01:13:20,224
Mr. Theopolis?

895
01:13:20,329 --> 01:13:21,853
Yeah.

896
01:13:21,964 --> 01:13:23,363
Is Tammy your girlfriend?

897
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:25,860
What do you mean?

898
01:13:25,968 --> 01:13:28,300
Cindy says that she's your girlfriend,

899
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:32,670
and you got fired from Zomcon
for having a zombie girlfriend.

900
01:13:32,775 --> 01:13:34,140
She said that?

901
01:13:36,545 --> 01:13:38,376
Aren't you worried
they'll take her away?

902
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:40,072
Nah.

903
01:13:40,182 --> 01:13:42,707
I'll just get me another one,
the same vintage.

904
01:13:44,086 --> 01:13:46,145
Hey, I'm kidding.

905
01:13:48,957 --> 01:13:50,652
I went and hurt her feelings.

906
01:13:54,897 --> 01:13:57,889
So, you clear on the plan?

907
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,558
Yeah.

908
01:14:07,810 --> 01:14:09,971
- Theopolis.
- Hi, Frank.

909
01:14:10,078 --> 01:14:11,602
What are you doing back here?

910
01:14:11,713 --> 01:14:14,773
Oh, you know, just bringing the old unit
in for a tune-up.

911
01:14:18,754 --> 01:14:22,281
It's, um... Tammy.

912
01:14:22,391 --> 01:14:24,859
- Right?
- That's right. Tammy.

913
01:14:27,596 --> 01:14:28,858
So...

914
01:14:32,568 --> 01:14:35,503
Okay, go ahead.

915
01:14:35,604 --> 01:14:36,866
Thanks, Frank.

916
01:14:43,445 --> 01:14:45,345
Timmy!

917
01:14:55,858 --> 01:14:57,382
Bill!

918
01:15:00,629 --> 01:15:02,824
If Timmy hadn't broken
the rules in the first place,

919
01:15:02,931 --> 01:15:04,262
none of this would have happened.

920
01:15:04,366 --> 01:15:06,425
He messed up, not me.

921
01:15:10,105 --> 01:15:12,164
I suppose you think he got so attached
to the damned thing

922
01:15:12,274 --> 01:15:14,469
because I'm a bad father.

923
01:15:19,181 --> 01:15:21,775
I'd say I'm a pretty
darn good father.

924
01:15:21,884 --> 01:15:23,374
My father tried to eat me.

925
01:15:23,485 --> 01:15:25,510
I don't remember trying to eat Timmy.

926
01:15:27,923 --> 01:15:30,323
Bill, just because your father
tried to eat you,

927
01:15:30,425 --> 01:15:33,223
does that mean we all have to be
unhappy...

928
01:15:33,328 --> 01:15:34,989
forever?

929
01:15:38,066 --> 01:15:41,126
Welcome to Zomcon's
returns department.

930
01:15:41,236 --> 01:15:45,002
<i>Please</i>... stay with your zombie
at all times,

931
01:15:45,107 --> 01:15:48,133
maintain an orderly line
between the railings,

932
01:15:48,243 --> 01:15:51,007
and use our conveniently
placed safety buttons...

933
01:15:51,113 --> 01:15:52,603
Come on.

934
01:15:54,583 --> 01:15:56,278
- Are you all right, Mr. Theopolis?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

935
01:15:57,719 --> 01:16:00,745
Now, the door into the factory
is right behind the clerk.

936
01:16:00,856 --> 01:16:03,416
Are you ready?

937
01:16:08,163 --> 01:16:10,222
All right.

938
01:16:14,069 --> 01:16:15,866
Honey...

939
01:16:15,971 --> 01:16:17,666
I'm gonna be gone
for a little while,

940
01:16:17,773 --> 01:16:20,241
and then I'm gonna
come back, all right?

941
01:16:20,342 --> 01:16:22,242
You stay here.

942
01:16:31,820 --> 01:16:34,687
All right. Let's do this.

943
01:16:40,062 --> 01:16:43,293
Wild zombie! Wild zombie!

944
01:17:03,719 --> 01:17:06,483
That's my Tammy.

945
01:17:06,588 --> 01:17:10,422
You... You knucklehead!

946
01:17:13,862 --> 01:17:15,853
Fido?

947
01:17:19,368 --> 01:17:22,030
All right, seal off the returns room...

948
01:17:22,137 --> 01:17:24,731
and shut off that damned alarm.

949
01:17:28,744 --> 01:17:31,542
You naughty little boy.

950
01:17:32,948 --> 01:17:34,813
No, not you.
I'll call you back.

951
01:17:44,626 --> 01:17:46,321
Fido?

952
01:17:47,763 --> 01:17:49,128
Fido?

953
01:17:56,071 --> 01:17:57,060
Fido!

954
01:17:58,674 --> 01:18:00,164
I'll be right down!

955
01:18:01,877 --> 01:18:03,777
Hello, Timmy.

956
01:18:03,879 --> 01:18:04,846
No!

957
01:18:19,661 --> 01:18:21,492
Turn the car around.

958
01:18:21,596 --> 01:18:23,188
We need to keep the road clear.

959
01:18:23,298 --> 01:18:24,731
Of course, Frank.

960
01:18:38,246 --> 01:18:40,976
- What's happening here?
- I'll call it in!

961
01:18:45,754 --> 01:18:48,314
This way! This way!

962
01:18:50,425 --> 01:18:51,619
Timmy!

963
01:18:53,829 --> 01:18:55,319
Bill, give me that gun.
I'm going in.

964
01:18:55,430 --> 01:18:56,954
You stay here
in case Timmy shows up.

965
01:18:57,065 --> 01:18:59,727
No, l... I want to.

966
01:18:59,835 --> 01:19:01,826
Bill, give me the shotgun.

967
01:19:01,937 --> 01:19:03,404
I am a good father.

968
01:19:05,741 --> 01:19:06,708
Bill!

969
01:19:08,510 --> 01:19:11,502
Remember, Helen...
head coffin.

970
01:19:22,991 --> 01:19:25,858
- I just wanna show you something.
- You can't make me go!

971
01:19:25,961 --> 01:19:27,428
- Come on!
- No!

972
01:19:27,529 --> 01:19:30,623
Now... take a look,
all right?

973
01:19:30,732 --> 01:19:33,724
Out there is chaos.

974
01:19:33,835 --> 01:19:36,827
And in here is safety.

975
01:19:36,938 --> 01:19:40,032
People who don't understand that

976
01:19:40,142 --> 01:19:42,474
end up on the wrong side
of the fence.

977
01:19:42,577 --> 01:19:44,306
Now go on and make yourself
some friends.

978
01:19:44,412 --> 01:19:46,004
No! No!

979
01:19:46,114 --> 01:19:48,105
Let me out! Please!

980
01:20:04,399 --> 01:20:06,424
Stay away from me.

981
01:20:07,736 --> 01:20:09,761
Come on, Robinson.

982
01:20:12,541 --> 01:20:14,668
All right. All right.

983
01:20:24,953 --> 01:20:26,352
Fido, it's you.

984
01:20:26,454 --> 01:20:28,547
Where's Timmy Boy?

985
01:20:28,657 --> 01:20:31,956
They're not particularly fast,
are they?

986
01:20:32,060 --> 01:20:33,027
Fido!

987
01:20:35,463 --> 01:20:36,555
Dad!

988
01:20:36,665 --> 01:20:38,098
Robinson?

989
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:42,102
I'd like you to let my son
back inside the gate now, please.

990
01:20:42,204 --> 01:20:43,171
I don't think so.

991
01:20:47,509 --> 01:20:49,602
Now you be quiet!

992
01:21:00,889 --> 01:21:01,856
Help!

993
01:21:14,135 --> 01:21:15,329
Leave him alone!

994
01:21:19,608 --> 01:21:20,836
Dad!

995
01:21:31,353 --> 01:21:32,980
Get him, boy!

996
01:21:43,465 --> 01:21:45,626
Fido! Behind you!

997
01:21:55,477 --> 01:21:57,035
Mom!

998
01:21:57,145 --> 01:21:58,305
Where's your father?

999
01:22:18,099 --> 01:22:19,361
Get in.

1000
01:22:26,007 --> 01:22:27,770
See you later, Frank.

1001
01:22:29,811 --> 01:22:32,143
My God.

1002
01:22:53,234 --> 01:22:55,202
Zomcon forces spent
Saturday afternoon

1003
01:22:55,303 --> 01:22:57,066
securing a Wild Zone breach

1004
01:22:57,172 --> 01:23:00,630
within Willard's own
Zomcon Containment Center.

1005
01:23:00,742 --> 01:23:02,403
Human casualties were low,

1006
01:23:02,510 --> 01:23:07,140
but the nation mourns one of its greatest
and most respected war heroes.

1007
01:23:07,248 --> 01:23:10,308
Zomcon Chief John Bottoms
died valiantly

1008
01:23:10,418 --> 01:23:11,908
while defending
the people of Willard

1009
01:23:12,020 --> 01:23:15,547
from a wild zombie outbreak
caused by this man...

1010
01:23:15,657 --> 01:23:16,954
Frank Murphy,

1011
01:23:17,058 --> 01:23:19,549
a once-trusted Zomcon
security guard,

1012
01:23:19,661 --> 01:23:21,288
who was caught accepting bribes

1013
01:23:21,396 --> 01:23:23,864
from a renegade group
of wild zombie poachers.

1014
01:23:29,204 --> 01:23:30,398
Are you ready, dear?

1015
01:23:37,779 --> 01:23:40,043
Head coffin, please.

1016
01:23:48,023 --> 01:23:49,854
Bill Robinson...

1017
01:23:49,958 --> 01:23:53,792
from dust have you come,
and to dust shall you return.

1018
01:23:53,895 --> 01:23:57,023
But from dust shall you not be
resurrected.

1019
01:24:01,036 --> 01:24:03,504
It's what he always wanted.

1020
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:14,846
Okay, Tammy,
just what you ordered.

1021
01:24:17,719 --> 01:24:20,449
Now don't you move a muscle.

1022
01:24:20,555 --> 01:24:23,046
There's only one Tammy
in the world, right?

1023
01:24:41,676 --> 01:24:43,541
Nice catch!

1024
01:24:48,283 --> 01:24:50,080
Hi, Timmy. Hi, Fido.

1025
01:24:53,321 --> 01:24:54,720
Hi, Timmy.

1026
01:24:56,291 --> 01:24:57,918
Surprised?

1027
01:24:58,026 --> 01:24:59,926
Sort of.

1028
01:25:00,028 --> 01:25:02,462
It's okay.
He's so cool in a way.

1029
01:25:02,564 --> 01:25:04,191
And he's a lot nicer.

1030
01:25:06,468 --> 01:25:09,130
- Do you wanna play catch?
- Sure.

1031
01:25:09,237 --> 01:25:11,432
Does, uh, your zombie
wanna play?

1032
01:25:14,509 --> 01:25:16,670
What do you call him, anyways?

1033
01:25:16,778 --> 01:25:18,302
I don't know.

1034
01:25:18,413 --> 01:25:20,176
Right now I'm just calling him Daddy.

1035
01:25:20,281 --> 01:25:22,749
Sure. Okay.

1036
01:25:22,851 --> 01:25:24,785
Come on.

1037
01:25:24,886 --> 01:25:26,751
Come on, Daddy.

1038
01:31:41,496 --> 01:31:44,465
