1
00:01:50,055 --> 00:01:52,855
So he wants to cut it off
just like that?

2
00:01:55,175 --> 00:01:57,375
He doesn't think
you can handle it.

3
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:00,534
The arrangements have been concluded.

4
00:02:00,615 --> 00:02:05,054
I gave them my word
because he gave me his word.

5
00:02:05,135 --> 00:02:06,815
Tell me why.

6
00:02:06,854 --> 00:02:09,054
You know why.

7
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:13,534
You're not strong anymore.

8
00:02:14,574 --> 00:02:16,094
You lost control.

9
00:02:18,294 --> 00:02:22,333
You tell him this.
Nothing has changed.

10
00:02:22,414 --> 00:02:26,213
We've had a few setbacks.
That's to be expected in any business.

11
00:02:26,294 --> 00:02:30,453
But I am still in charge,
and I am still strong!

12
00:02:30,493 --> 00:02:32,373
Make no mistake.

13
00:02:32,413 --> 00:02:36,452
You tell him
he had better keep his word.

14
00:02:36,533 --> 00:02:39,293
Tell him the 25th as agreed.

15
00:02:40,572 --> 00:02:45,092
I'll send him a sign,
a little demonstration...

16
00:02:45,172 --> 00:02:48,292
to prove that I'm still strong.

17
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:30,330
- Good afternoon, Mr. Douvier.
- Good afternoon, Simone.

18
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:38,489
- Any calls?
- On your desk.

19
00:03:47,729 --> 00:03:49,569
What's this "Dr. Herb called"?

20
00:03:49,649 --> 00:03:52,328
That's your yearly checkup,
Tuesday at 4:30.

21
00:03:52,409 --> 00:03:55,088
Okay. Is New York going to call back?

22
00:03:55,129 --> 00:03:57,128
Between 5:00 and 6:00.

23
00:03:57,209 --> 00:03:59,728
Good.
Everybody else here?

24
00:03:59,768 --> 00:04:01,728
Yes. In the boardroom.

25
00:04:12,767 --> 00:04:15,608
I don't think we should
keep them waiting any longer.

26
00:04:21,927 --> 00:04:24,487
- Will I see you tonight?
- Of course, Miss Le Gree.

27
00:04:38,686 --> 00:04:41,046
Gentlemen, we have a problem.

28
00:04:41,126 --> 00:04:43,086
The Gannet transaction
is in jeopardy...

29
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:46,006
because New York seems to feel
I no longer have...

30
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:48,405
the power to control
the situation.

31
00:04:48,446 --> 00:04:51,285
So I have sent word...

32
00:04:51,325 --> 00:04:56,565
that I will give them
a demonstration, a sign...

33
00:04:56,606 --> 00:05:00,085
to show that I am still in control.

34
00:05:00,165 --> 00:05:02,765
That France is still
a viable territory.

35
00:05:03,925 --> 00:05:07,085
What I want from you,
are suggestions.

36
00:05:08,405 --> 00:05:10,445
I have an idea.

37
00:05:10,524 --> 00:05:11,925
All right.

38
00:05:11,965 --> 00:05:15,405
Would you ask your secretary
to bring in the morning paper?

39
00:05:17,724 --> 00:05:21,443
- Would you bring in the morning paper?
- Right away, sir.

40
00:05:25,804 --> 00:05:28,364
Who is the most important man
in France today?

41
00:05:28,443 --> 00:05:30,643
Present company excluded, of course.

42
00:05:30,724 --> 00:05:32,203
Thank you.

43
00:05:32,283 --> 00:05:35,243
- The president, I suppose.
- For our purpose.

44
00:05:35,323 --> 00:05:39,003
A man New York knows even better
than the president of France.

45
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:43,083
A man with which our entire
world organization is familiar...

46
00:05:43,163 --> 00:05:45,843
and would like nothing better
than to see him out of the way.

47
00:05:45,923 --> 00:05:47,642
Who?

48
00:05:51,522 --> 00:05:54,962
Who has given us nothing but trouble
for the past ten years?

49
00:05:55,043 --> 00:05:59,522
Who has survived
16 assassination attempts?

50
00:05:59,602 --> 00:06:02,682
Including two by his own boss.

51
00:06:07,401 --> 00:06:08,762
Clouseau.

52
00:06:08,841 --> 00:06:13,161
You want to impress New York,
eliminate Clouseau.

53
00:06:13,201 --> 00:06:16,241
Eliminate Clouseau and we'll have
every cop in France down on our necks.

54
00:06:16,321 --> 00:06:18,481
Not if we do it smart.

55
00:06:18,561 --> 00:06:22,121
There is a rumor
that he is really a complete imbecile.

56
00:06:22,161 --> 00:06:23,561
I've heard that.

57
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,840
Yet he continues to survive.

58
00:06:25,881 --> 00:06:29,800
I have it on good authority
that he is anything but an imbecile.

59
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,400
That he only plays at the fool.

60
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,840
In any case, it is too dangerous.

61
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,160
Can you do it smart?

62
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:45,719
Yes.

63
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,719
Do it.

64
00:11:51,063 --> 00:11:52,983
Balls?

65
00:11:53,063 --> 00:11:56,583
Inspector Clouseau!
My dear Chief lnspector Clouseau!

66
00:11:56,663 --> 00:11:59,902
How I have missed you!
How we have missed you!

67
00:11:59,943 --> 00:12:03,742
Your disguise is ready for the
final fitting. You'll be very pleased.

68
00:12:03,782 --> 00:12:06,942
Cunny! Quick! Quick!
lnspector Clouseau is here!

69
00:12:07,022 --> 00:12:08,902
I noticed you have
some very interesting new noses.

70
00:12:08,982 --> 00:12:12,262
I will model them for you.
Cunny, get on with it!

71
00:12:12,342 --> 00:12:15,142
I will bring you one right away.

72
00:12:15,222 --> 00:12:17,542
- There were some on the left.
- Yes, yes.

73
00:12:17,621 --> 00:12:19,462
The final fitting.

74
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:23,141
I call this one "Wino and Roses."

75
00:12:29,821 --> 00:12:34,421
Magnificent.
Even though I say so myself.

76
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,701
This is no small feat.

77
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:40,660
Now you can work the Left Bank
and Montmartre with anonymity.

78
00:12:40,741 --> 00:12:45,420
Yes. The old anonymity ploy.

79
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:55,339
That's it!
You can do it, lnspector!

80
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,020
Chief lnspector.

81
00:12:57,099 --> 00:13:01,099
You can walk, Chief lnspector.
You can walk!

82
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,859
Yes! Yes!

83
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:06,299
You are a genius, Balls.

84
00:13:06,339 --> 00:13:10,459
I can! I can walk!

85
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:17,978
Thank heavens

86
00:13:18,058 --> 00:13:22,338
For little girls

87
00:13:22,418 --> 00:13:27,298
They keep on getting smaller
every day

88
00:13:40,937 --> 00:13:42,297
Yes?

89
00:13:42,377 --> 00:13:44,697
A special delivery.

90
00:13:46,297 --> 00:13:47,657
Thank you.

91
00:13:50,257 --> 00:13:52,816
I'm sorry. I'm a little short.

92
00:13:52,857 --> 00:13:54,257
Forget it.

93
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:06,016
Special delivery. A bomb.

94
00:14:06,096 --> 00:14:08,056
Were you expecting one?

95
00:14:08,975 --> 00:14:10,656
A bomb?

96
00:14:28,135 --> 00:14:29,615
Yes?

97
00:14:31,494 --> 00:14:32,854
What?

98
00:14:37,814 --> 00:14:39,214
Right.

99
00:14:39,254 --> 00:14:42,174
What's the matter?

100
00:14:42,254 --> 00:14:46,013
The bomb destroyed half the block,
and Clouseau survived.

101
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:49,934
I am certain, sir,
that the bomb was intended for me.

102
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:51,893
- Bomb?
- What?

103
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:54,653
- You said, "bomb."
- Yes, yes.

104
00:14:54,734 --> 00:14:56,933
Fortunately, Professor Balls...

105
00:14:57,013 --> 00:15:00,693
took refuge behind a new shipment
of inflatable goiters...

106
00:15:00,773 --> 00:15:02,813
which cushioned the force
of the explosion.

107
00:15:02,893 --> 00:15:04,492
Inflatable goiters?

108
00:15:04,532 --> 00:15:07,412
Yes. His Valentine's Day collection.

109
00:15:09,172 --> 00:15:11,012
It's amazing that you survived.

110
00:15:11,092 --> 00:15:12,492
Yes, yes.

111
00:15:12,532 --> 00:15:15,172
I must apprehend this mad bomber...

112
00:15:15,252 --> 00:15:17,931
before he does any more
of the damage in here.

113
00:15:17,972 --> 00:15:19,451
Or she.

114
00:15:19,532 --> 00:15:22,252
- "Or she"?
- A man dressed as a woman.

115
00:15:26,771 --> 00:15:29,452
"Four armed robberies in three weeks.

116
00:15:29,491 --> 00:15:32,732
Two of the victims were assaulted
and grappled with the robber.

117
00:15:32,811 --> 00:15:36,531
Both the victims felt the robber
was much too strong to be a woman.

118
00:15:37,931 --> 00:15:41,530
Three years ago, we sent to prison
a man named Claude Russo.

119
00:15:41,611 --> 00:15:45,290
Russo committed robberies
disguised as a woman."

120
00:15:45,331 --> 00:15:48,810
Well, sir,
I must be off to apprehend...

121
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:51,970
this mad bomber now.

122
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:55,450
Remember, it just could be Russo.

123
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:58,090
Yes, it just could be Russo. Yes.

124
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:01,449
- Yes. I just said that.
- Yes, I know that. Yes, sir.

125
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:05,650
Well, sir, until we meet again,
and the case is solved.

126
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,129
Fire!

127
00:16:29,448 --> 00:16:31,608
You may not have seen
these gentlemen before...

128
00:16:31,688 --> 00:16:34,168
but they have at one time or another
worked for you.

129
00:16:34,248 --> 00:16:36,527
And needless to say,
they are specialists.

130
00:16:36,568 --> 00:16:38,327
The best in France.

131
00:16:38,408 --> 00:16:41,168
And you expect them
to take care of Clouseau?

132
00:16:41,207 --> 00:16:44,847
Oh, no. They've been contracted
to eliminate Mr. Chong.

133
00:16:44,927 --> 00:16:46,607
Who is Mr. Chong?

134
00:16:53,327 --> 00:16:56,527
Mr. Chong was recommended
by Hong Kong.

135
00:17:02,926 --> 00:17:06,406
Gentlemen, fulfill your contracts.

136
00:18:38,761 --> 00:18:41,921
Why don't you get out of those
wet clothes? You could catch pneumonia.

137
00:18:41,961 --> 00:18:43,841
Yes, I know that.

138
00:18:43,881 --> 00:18:48,401
I will as soon as I get home provided
idiot Cato does not attack me first.

139
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,521
Why don't you tell him not to?

140
00:18:50,601 --> 00:18:52,681
Believe me, it's not that easy.

141
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:56,720
I gave him instructions to attack me
wherever and whenever possible.

142
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:01,280
And it has now become a matter of pride
with him to try to outsmart me.

143
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:05,120
I guarantee that at this very minute
his fiendish yellow brain...

144
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,080
is plotting some new ambush.

145
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:14,399
Yes, I know that.

146
00:20:09,797 --> 00:20:11,196
Cato?

147
00:20:33,835 --> 00:20:37,755
Pay attention!
This is your employer speaking.

148
00:20:37,794 --> 00:20:41,995
I am canceling the attack orders
for tonight.

149
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,195
Do you understand?

150
00:20:44,274 --> 00:20:48,994
I know that I told you
to show no mercy...

151
00:20:49,074 --> 00:20:52,954
and to attack
and to pay no attention to what I say.

152
00:20:55,394 --> 00:20:56,754
But tonight--

153
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:03,313
But tonight...

154
00:21:03,394 --> 00:21:07,033
I am ordering you
to pay attention!

155
00:21:10,513 --> 00:21:13,793
You will not attack, Cato!

156
00:21:21,633 --> 00:21:23,273
Shut up that row!

157
00:21:23,352 --> 00:21:26,712
I am trying to save my life,
madam.

158
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:37,152
Obviously the little yellow slime
is not paying attention.

159
00:23:28,666 --> 00:23:31,985
It's a very substantial building,
but we're doing a great deal to it.

160
00:23:32,066 --> 00:23:35,865
I'm sure when it's finished,
you'll find it peaceful and delightful.

161
00:24:04,744 --> 00:24:06,703
Chief lnspector Clouseau's residence.

162
00:24:07,704 --> 00:24:09,863
One moment, please.

163
00:24:09,944 --> 00:24:11,464
For you.

164
00:24:24,662 --> 00:24:27,063
What on earth is going on?

165
00:24:27,102 --> 00:24:29,742
Excuse me, madame and messieurs.

166
00:24:29,823 --> 00:24:31,702
I beg your pardon.
I am so sorry.

167
00:24:31,743 --> 00:24:33,622
It's still for you.

168
00:24:33,662 --> 00:24:35,582
Chief lnspector.

169
00:24:35,662 --> 00:24:38,221
Pardon me.
I am needed on the phone.

170
00:24:43,701 --> 00:24:45,261
Hello?

171
00:24:45,302 --> 00:24:49,302
This is Chief lnspector Clouseau
speaking on the phone.

172
00:24:49,381 --> 00:24:52,101
Listen to me carefully.

173
00:24:52,181 --> 00:24:54,461
If you want to catch
the French Connection...

174
00:24:54,541 --> 00:24:56,381
meet me tonight at 11:00...

175
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:59,701
in the Bois de Bologne
near the Grande Cascade.

176
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,901
And come alone.

177
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:14,580
That's so obvious,
he's bound to think it's a trap.

178
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:19,340
Yes, or it's so obvious that he's bound
to think it can't be a trap.

179
00:25:19,379 --> 00:25:22,060
It's so obvious,
it's bound to be a trap.

180
00:25:22,139 --> 00:25:25,100
That is why you will never be
a great detective.

181
00:25:25,139 --> 00:25:27,659
It's so obvious,
it could not possibly be a trap.

182
00:25:27,739 --> 00:25:31,859
Now, Cato, warm up the Silver Hornet.

183
00:25:56,178 --> 00:25:58,578
I very much suspect...

184
00:25:58,617 --> 00:26:01,578
that the Hornet is overdue
for a service...

185
00:26:01,617 --> 00:26:04,377
so if you don't mind,
I'll use your car tonight.

186
00:26:24,096 --> 00:26:27,376
He's driving a white Peugeot.
License number is--

187
00:26:47,255 --> 00:26:50,135
By any chance,
are you going to Fontainebleau?

188
00:26:50,215 --> 00:26:51,414
Well--

189
00:26:51,495 --> 00:26:53,174
Wonderful!

190
00:26:55,134 --> 00:26:57,014
How lucky can a girl get?

191
00:26:57,094 --> 00:26:59,534
You're an absolute darling.

192
00:27:02,174 --> 00:27:03,894
It's green.

193
00:27:03,974 --> 00:27:05,334
It is?

194
00:27:05,414 --> 00:27:07,694
The traffic light.

195
00:27:16,174 --> 00:27:20,413
Generally speaking, it's dangerous
for a beautiful girl like you...

196
00:27:20,493 --> 00:27:22,733
to be hitchhiking at night.

197
00:27:22,773 --> 00:27:25,733
I know. That's because,
generally speaking...

198
00:27:25,773 --> 00:27:28,533
beautiful girls like me
don't carry guns.

199
00:27:28,613 --> 00:27:30,333
Yes, yes.

200
00:27:36,012 --> 00:27:39,652
Are you saying
that you carry a gun?

201
00:27:40,852 --> 00:27:44,292
I've got it in here somewhere.
It's not very big.

202
00:27:44,372 --> 00:27:46,251
Watch it.
It might go off.

203
00:27:46,292 --> 00:27:49,332
Only if you don't do
exactly what I say.

204
00:27:50,931 --> 00:27:52,331
Listen, Miss--

205
00:27:52,372 --> 00:27:54,411
Russo.

206
00:27:54,491 --> 00:27:57,331
But you can call me Claude.

207
00:28:01,691 --> 00:28:03,331
Pull off the road.

208
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:07,011
Oh, the old "pull off the road" ploy!

209
00:28:07,051 --> 00:28:12,411
Yes. Then we will see how you do with
the old "take off your clothes" ploy.

210
00:28:40,489 --> 00:28:43,649
And if you don't want
to freeze to death, put on the dress.

211
00:28:43,689 --> 00:28:44,728
Never!

212
00:28:44,809 --> 00:28:48,128
Suit yourself.
But the dress is an original Dior...

213
00:28:48,209 --> 00:28:51,048
and you've got sensational legs.

214
00:29:29,966 --> 00:29:31,366
Yes?

215
00:29:33,286 --> 00:29:36,086
Oh. Good. Thank you.

216
00:29:36,166 --> 00:29:38,325
Why don't you just take that
off the hook?

217
00:29:38,406 --> 00:29:43,525
Won't be necessary. The great lnspector
Clouseau won't be bothering us anymore.

218
00:29:50,605 --> 00:29:52,965
Hello, boys!

219
00:29:53,045 --> 00:29:55,365
Am I glad to see you!

220
00:29:55,405 --> 00:29:59,204
And we are certainly glad
to see you.

221
00:30:00,804 --> 00:30:02,685
Wait a moment!
You know me.

222
00:30:02,724 --> 00:30:04,924
I'm Chief lnspector Clouseau
of the surete.

223
00:30:05,004 --> 00:30:06,884
And I am Officer Bardot.

224
00:30:06,965 --> 00:30:09,165
But you can call me Brigitte.

225
00:30:09,244 --> 00:30:12,603
Listen, Brigitte. You are making
an understandable mistake.

226
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:15,844
Don't let my legs fool you.
I'm really a man. Listen!

227
00:30:18,764 --> 00:30:22,683
The palace flag is lowered
to half-mast.

228
00:30:23,964 --> 00:30:27,323
The president has declared a day
of national mourning.

229
00:30:28,323 --> 00:30:30,403
Only a few hours ago...

230
00:30:30,483 --> 00:30:33,882
the great detective stood
in this very courtyard...

231
00:30:33,963 --> 00:30:35,843
and was decorated by the president...

232
00:30:35,883 --> 00:30:37,923
for outstanding service
to his country.

233
00:30:39,843 --> 00:30:42,083
According to the coroner's report...

234
00:30:42,122 --> 00:30:45,522
Chief lnspector Clouseau
was probably dead...

235
00:30:45,602 --> 00:30:48,922
before his car hit the telephone pole...

236
00:30:48,962 --> 00:30:50,762
and burst into flames.

237
00:30:54,601 --> 00:30:57,842
The president called me at 6:00
this morning.

238
00:30:57,921 --> 00:31:01,441
A dozen countries have offered the
services of their finest detectives...

239
00:31:01,521 --> 00:31:03,841
but the president
made it painfully clear...

240
00:31:03,921 --> 00:31:06,681
that this must be solved by Frenchmen,
and quickly...

241
00:31:06,721 --> 00:31:08,641
or we can all hand in
our resignations.

242
00:31:08,721 --> 00:31:10,841
I spoke with Dr. Laprone
at the hospital...

243
00:31:10,921 --> 00:31:13,761
and he assures me that Dreyfus
is completely cured.

244
00:31:15,241 --> 00:31:16,761
It's amazing.

245
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,361
I've seen some lunatics
in my time.

246
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,720
They were all pikers compared
with Dreyfus. He was like a wild animal!

247
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,920
Didn't he actually bite you?

248
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,000
Oh, yes. On the leg.

249
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,519
I had to take rabies shots
just in case.

250
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,200
The doctor swears
that his recovery is complete.

251
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:37,919
He said that in the last 12 hours,
Dreyfus has literally become a new man.

252
00:31:37,959 --> 00:31:39,999
Thank God for that because we need him.

253
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,639
If anyone knows about Clouseau
and who might have murdered him...

254
00:31:43,719 --> 00:31:47,039
that man is former
Chief lnspector Charles Dreyfus.

255
00:31:47,918 --> 00:31:50,079
Isn't it fantastic, Doctor?

256
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:54,479
Reinstated at my former rank
with no loss of pay or social benefits.

257
00:31:54,558 --> 00:31:58,039
Yes. It could actually be called
a psychic rebirth.

258
00:31:58,078 --> 00:32:00,958
I am in your debt.
I shall be eternally grateful.

259
00:32:01,038 --> 00:32:03,318
I only helped.
I led the way.

260
00:32:03,358 --> 00:32:06,878
But in the final analysis,
it was your victory, Charles.

261
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:08,958
Our victory, Paul.

262
00:32:09,038 --> 00:32:11,358
But only at the expense of another.

263
00:32:11,438 --> 00:32:13,997
Huh? Oh, Clouseau, you mean.

264
00:32:14,078 --> 00:32:18,397
It could be said that he died
so that you might live.

265
00:32:18,477 --> 00:32:20,317
I wish I could feel sorry.

266
00:32:20,397 --> 00:32:22,237
You feel no guilt?

267
00:32:22,317 --> 00:32:23,957
None.

268
00:32:24,037 --> 00:32:26,876
To be honest,
when I first heard he was dead...

269
00:32:26,917 --> 00:32:28,796
there were a few moments...

270
00:32:28,877 --> 00:32:32,717
when I was actually convinced
I was in a state of grace.

271
00:32:33,916 --> 00:32:35,516
Is that wrong?

272
00:32:35,596 --> 00:32:38,117
It isn't a matter of right or wrong.

273
00:32:38,196 --> 00:32:40,116
Look, I hated him.

274
00:32:40,196 --> 00:32:43,516
He literally drove me out of my mind,
as you know.

275
00:32:43,556 --> 00:32:47,156
Isn't it natural that
I should feel happiness, even joy...

276
00:32:47,195 --> 00:32:51,835
at the thought of him being dead,
out of the way and gone forever?

277
00:32:51,915 --> 00:32:53,435
Natural, yes.

278
00:32:53,515 --> 00:32:56,595
But there is a danger
that such feelings might promote guilt.

279
00:32:56,635 --> 00:32:59,275
Clouseau could come back
and haunt you.

280
00:32:59,355 --> 00:33:02,075
- I have no guilt.
- Not now.

281
00:33:02,115 --> 00:33:06,755
Not ever. Clouseau is gone,
and I am free forever.

282
00:33:06,834 --> 00:33:08,795
Now, have a cigar.

283
00:33:08,874 --> 00:33:10,434
Thank you, Charles.

284
00:33:10,514 --> 00:33:12,795
I've made the necessary arrangements
for your release.

285
00:33:12,874 --> 00:33:15,914
The surete is sending a car
for you to be picked up at 5:30.

286
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:18,594
Remember, you're on probation
for 12 months.

287
00:33:18,674 --> 00:33:22,114
If you have any problems,
call on me immediately.

288
00:33:22,194 --> 00:33:24,034
Thank you, Paul.

289
00:33:29,954 --> 00:33:32,673
Listen to me, Officer.
You are making a serious mistake.

290
00:33:32,753 --> 00:33:35,433
Unless you release me immediately,
I will personally see to it...

291
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:38,993
that you are transferred to Martinique
where you will spend your career...

292
00:33:39,073 --> 00:33:41,912
writing traffic citations
and checking parking meters.

293
00:33:41,993 --> 00:33:45,752
The man who was killed in that car,
my car, uh, Cato's car, was not me.

294
00:33:45,833 --> 00:33:48,432
He was wearing my clothes, yes.
These are his clothes!

295
00:33:48,473 --> 00:33:50,712
I am Chief lnspector Jacques Clouseau.

296
00:33:50,793 --> 00:33:52,632
Miss or Missus?

297
00:33:52,712 --> 00:33:56,232
You fool! The president himself
when he decorated me said...

298
00:33:56,312 --> 00:33:59,072
"Clouseau, you are a man of courage."

299
00:33:59,152 --> 00:34:01,951
And he called me the greatest detective
in all of France.

300
00:34:02,032 --> 00:34:04,671
Charlatan! lmpostor!

301
00:34:04,752 --> 00:34:07,351
All right, calm down, Mr. Poirot.

302
00:34:07,431 --> 00:34:08,831
Poirot?

303
00:34:08,912 --> 00:34:13,471
Yes. Yes.
But you can call me Hercule.

304
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:16,831
And I am the greatest detective
in all of France...

305
00:34:16,911 --> 00:34:18,831
the greatest in all the world.

306
00:34:24,910 --> 00:34:27,430
That man is obviously crazy.

307
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:29,550
We do not use that word around here.

308
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:32,950
- What do you normally use around here?
- Now, now!

309
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:35,389
He is very now-now,
I can tell you that.

310
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:37,350
Court order.

311
00:34:37,430 --> 00:34:40,629
I shall need your signature
on the transfer document.

312
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:49,549
Ninety days comprehensive--
Thank you.

313
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:51,909
Psychiatric examination.

314
00:35:29,067 --> 00:35:30,666
Peekaboo.

315
00:35:32,746 --> 00:35:34,786
Your car's at the entrance, lnspector.

316
00:35:43,346 --> 00:35:45,546
Good-bye, Chief lnspector Dreyfus.

317
00:35:56,185 --> 00:35:58,305
Good evening, Chief lnspector Dreyfus.

318
00:35:58,385 --> 00:36:00,665
Good evening, Francois.

319
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:08,225
It's good to have you back on the job,
Chief lnspector.

320
00:36:08,305 --> 00:36:11,984
Is it true that you will personally take
charge of the Clouseau investigation?

321
00:36:12,025 --> 00:36:13,224
Yes.

322
00:36:13,305 --> 00:36:16,344
You must feel torn.
On the one hand, it is your duty...

323
00:36:16,425 --> 00:36:19,904
to send the guilty parties
to the guillotine for killing Clouseau.

324
00:36:19,984 --> 00:36:22,704
On the other hand...

325
00:36:22,744 --> 00:36:25,704
I'm sure you'd rather
congratulate them, eh?

326
00:36:26,824 --> 00:36:29,383
Can you imagine,
a state funeral for that idiot?

327
00:36:29,424 --> 00:36:32,663
The president, dignitaries
from all over the world will be coming.

328
00:36:32,744 --> 00:36:36,103
Why, there's a rumor
the pope might even show up.

329
00:36:36,143 --> 00:36:38,063
Pope?

330
00:36:39,343 --> 00:36:40,783
Pope?

331
00:36:40,863 --> 00:36:42,063
What?

332
00:36:42,143 --> 00:36:45,263
You said pope.
Do you have a cold?

333
00:36:45,343 --> 00:36:49,583
Yes, yes. I have the cold
in the chest, you know.

334
00:36:50,423 --> 00:36:53,542
You sound terrible.
Do you want me to send you a doctor?

335
00:36:53,623 --> 00:36:56,822
No, no. It's much better
than it sounds.

336
00:36:56,903 --> 00:37:00,302
Anyway, I want to go directly
to the Clouseau apartments...

337
00:37:00,382 --> 00:37:02,822
to commence the search
for the clues.

338
00:37:02,862 --> 00:37:04,262
Yes, sir.

339
00:37:30,341 --> 00:37:32,421
This is the Clouseau residence?

340
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,700
Yes.

341
00:37:40,139 --> 00:37:45,420
This is also the residence
of the Clouseau manservant Cato Fong?

342
00:37:45,499 --> 00:37:47,139
Yes.

343
00:37:47,179 --> 00:37:50,100
Then be so good as to tell him...

344
00:37:50,179 --> 00:37:53,859
that I wish to have speaks with him.

345
00:37:53,899 --> 00:37:58,539
Who shall I say wish to have speaks
with Mr. Fong?

346
00:38:00,019 --> 00:38:02,179
Tell him it is an old friend.

347
00:38:02,218 --> 00:38:04,819
Mr. Fong has many old friends.

348
00:38:04,899 --> 00:38:09,378
Listen, you, tell him
it is Chief lnspector...

349
00:38:11,218 --> 00:38:12,618
Clouseau.

350
00:38:12,698 --> 00:38:14,978
Why didn't you say so
in the first place?

351
00:38:15,018 --> 00:38:16,938
Please come in.

352
00:38:27,057 --> 00:38:28,457
Good evening...

353
00:38:28,538 --> 00:38:31,337
and congratulations!

354
00:38:31,418 --> 00:38:33,297
You are our first Caucasian...

355
00:38:33,377 --> 00:38:37,056
and that entitles you
to a 10% discount until midnight.

356
00:38:37,097 --> 00:38:40,617
- Who are you?
- Mrs. Wu. But you can call me Madam.

357
00:38:43,337 --> 00:38:46,056
- Yes?
- Inspector Clouseau.

358
00:38:46,097 --> 00:38:48,096
Please come in.

359
00:38:49,136 --> 00:38:51,496
- Welcome.
- Good evening.

360
00:38:51,536 --> 00:38:54,216
Please, make yourself at home.

361
00:38:55,575 --> 00:38:58,136
That man just called himself
lnspector Clouseau.

362
00:38:58,216 --> 00:39:00,056
It was Mr. Fong's idea...

363
00:39:00,135 --> 00:39:02,975
but personally I think
we should have a better password.

364
00:39:03,056 --> 00:39:04,456
Password?

365
00:39:11,455 --> 00:39:15,175
I demand to know exactly
what is going on in here.

366
00:39:15,215 --> 00:39:18,415
Just about anything
your little heart desires.

367
00:39:18,494 --> 00:39:21,094
But first,
why don't you relax?

368
00:39:21,175 --> 00:39:23,095
Give Benson your hat and coat...

369
00:39:23,174 --> 00:39:26,374
have a drink,
get to know the girls...

370
00:39:26,415 --> 00:39:28,494
and then when you are up to it...

371
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:33,534
you can choose from a wide variety
of exciting little diversions.

372
00:39:36,294 --> 00:39:39,254
But I see that you already have
a preference.

373
00:39:49,253 --> 00:39:53,253
Allow me to introduce Tanya,
the lotus eater.

374
00:39:54,493 --> 00:39:56,332
What else does she do?

375
00:40:02,532 --> 00:40:05,653
I warn you, Tanya, the Easter lotus...

376
00:40:05,732 --> 00:40:08,892
I am opposed
to the women's libs.

377
00:40:09,892 --> 00:40:14,171
Man is the master,
and women's place is in the home.

378
00:40:15,531 --> 00:40:19,171
And another round-eye
bites the dust.

379
00:40:30,851 --> 00:40:32,251
Cato!

380
00:40:40,611 --> 00:40:43,050
Take your hands off me,
you Oriental fool!

381
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:46,010
You are under arrest.
Anything you say will be taken down--

382
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:48,170
Arrest? Arrest?

383
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:51,290
You have the right to remain silent,
but let me tell you this.

384
00:40:51,329 --> 00:40:54,249
I am not your ordinary
run-of-the-mill transvestite.

385
00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:55,690
Say no more!

386
00:40:55,769 --> 00:40:57,610
What was that talk
about arresting us?

387
00:40:57,689 --> 00:41:00,249
-He was just kidding. Weren't you, boss?
-Boss?

388
00:41:00,329 --> 00:41:02,489
I used to work for him.
He used to be a cop.

389
00:41:02,569 --> 00:41:03,769
A cop?

390
00:41:03,849 --> 00:41:06,008
Tell them you were kidding, boss.

391
00:41:07,648 --> 00:41:12,088
Yes, he is right.
I was just kidding.

392
00:41:13,129 --> 00:41:15,248
Cross my heart...

393
00:41:15,329 --> 00:41:17,929
and hope to meet you again sometime.

394
00:41:18,008 --> 00:41:20,408
And you, madame...

395
00:41:20,488 --> 00:41:22,168
and you, too.

396
00:41:22,248 --> 00:41:24,728
You two should be ashamed
of yourselves.

397
00:41:24,807 --> 00:41:27,208
And you! I want to talk to you!

398
00:41:27,287 --> 00:41:31,608
- You come in here! Listen, now.
- Please, boss!

399
00:41:31,687 --> 00:41:33,447
I thought you were dead.

400
00:41:33,528 --> 00:41:37,247
As a tribute to my memory,
you open up...

401
00:41:37,327 --> 00:41:39,327
this Chinese nooky factory!

402
00:41:39,407 --> 00:41:41,927
I had to do something
to keep busy.

403
00:41:42,007 --> 00:41:46,567
Besides, a first-rate joint like this
can make 300,000, 400,000 a year!

404
00:41:49,686 --> 00:41:51,846
- Is that net?
- No, gross.

405
00:41:51,927 --> 00:41:55,486
But even so, a smart operator can
clear himself a couple hundred grand.

406
00:41:55,566 --> 00:41:57,847
And that ain't exactly chicken feed.

407
00:42:00,846 --> 00:42:04,926
And ten years on Devil's lsland ain't
exactly the chicken's feed, either...

408
00:42:05,005 --> 00:42:06,846
my greedy little yellow pimp.

409
00:42:07,885 --> 00:42:11,526
I'll have to close up anyway
now that you're alive.

410
00:42:11,605 --> 00:42:13,085
Yes, yes.

411
00:42:13,165 --> 00:42:17,445
Normally, that is precisely
what you would have to do.

412
00:42:17,525 --> 00:42:21,085
But these are not normal times.

413
00:42:21,164 --> 00:42:23,125
Someone has just tried to kill me.

414
00:42:23,205 --> 00:42:24,604
That's normal.

415
00:42:24,645 --> 00:42:27,965
But this time, that someone thinks
he has succeeded.

416
00:42:28,044 --> 00:42:32,284
Except for you and me,
the whole world believes that I am dead.

417
00:42:32,324 --> 00:42:36,204
And in this case,
death has its advantages.

418
00:42:38,684 --> 00:42:40,923
No one will know it is me...

419
00:42:41,004 --> 00:42:46,084
as I glide through the underworld
like a shadow.

420
00:42:48,083 --> 00:42:51,403
- Good evening, Commissioner.
- Charles!

421
00:42:55,203 --> 00:42:56,603
Thank you.

422
00:42:56,643 --> 00:43:00,083
I'm sorry to be late,
but as you must have heard...

423
00:43:00,163 --> 00:43:02,362
some lunatic was hiding in my closet.

424
00:43:02,443 --> 00:43:04,522
Yes. Russo.

425
00:43:04,603 --> 00:43:05,963
Russo?

426
00:43:09,082 --> 00:43:10,722
You remember.

427
00:43:10,803 --> 00:43:13,642
Why wouldn't I remember?
It was only three years ago.

428
00:43:13,722 --> 00:43:17,722
Of course. Claude Russo,
alias Claudine Russo.

429
00:43:17,802 --> 00:43:20,122
Armed robbery dressed as a woman.

430
00:43:20,202 --> 00:43:22,042
But he got five years.

431
00:43:22,121 --> 00:43:25,281
He was released on parole
three months ago.

432
00:43:25,361 --> 00:43:27,641
So it could have been Russo.

433
00:43:27,682 --> 00:43:29,801
He is clever.

434
00:43:29,881 --> 00:43:32,641
Clever enough to fool Francois?

435
00:43:32,721 --> 00:43:37,241
I like Francois, but fooling him
no longer constitutes...

436
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:41,280
an act of more than average cleverness,
shall we say?

437
00:43:44,961 --> 00:43:48,040
I always thought
he was rather a good policeman.

438
00:43:48,121 --> 00:43:50,720
When he was my assistant,
he was a very good policeman...

439
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,800
with a bright future.

440
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,719
But then he was assigned to Clouseau.

441
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,120
Now, Charles.

442
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:59,119
- All that's in the past.
- Yes, of course.

443
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,600
Tomorrow morning...

444
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:05,199
when they plant him six feet deep
and shovel in the dirt...

445
00:44:06,559 --> 00:44:08,799
I shall be truly free.

446
00:44:08,879 --> 00:44:12,479
Unless he's figured out a way
to come back from the dead...

447
00:44:12,559 --> 00:44:17,358
nothing that anyone does or says about
him will ever make any difference again.

448
00:44:17,439 --> 00:44:20,518
- Shall we do some work?
- That reminds me.

449
00:44:22,558 --> 00:44:23,958
What is it?

450
00:44:23,998 --> 00:44:27,358
The chief thinks
that you should give the eulogy.

451
00:44:27,438 --> 00:44:29,598
- The what?
- The tribute.

452
00:44:29,678 --> 00:44:30,638
Me?

453
00:44:30,718 --> 00:44:34,077
- You knew him intimately.
- I hated him intimately.

454
00:44:34,158 --> 00:44:37,998
But you're the expert who's going
to track down his murderers.

455
00:44:38,077 --> 00:44:41,878
I'm the expert who would love
to kiss his murderers. Understand?

456
00:44:41,957 --> 00:44:44,997
The P.R. people loved the angle.

457
00:44:46,037 --> 00:44:48,237
Sacrilege! I won't do it.

458
00:44:48,317 --> 00:44:49,716
Politics.

459
00:44:49,757 --> 00:44:51,916
No. I'm a good Catholic.

460
00:44:51,997 --> 00:44:54,637
- So is the chief's wife.
- I don't care.

461
00:44:54,676 --> 00:44:59,157
- What's she got to do with it?
- She wrote the speech.

462
00:45:00,276 --> 00:45:02,156
Ladies and gentlemen...

463
00:45:02,236 --> 00:45:04,756
honored guests...

464
00:45:05,796 --> 00:45:07,316
dear friends...

465
00:45:08,796 --> 00:45:10,676
we are gathered here...

466
00:45:10,715 --> 00:45:14,395
to say good-bye to a, uh...

467
00:45:17,555 --> 00:45:19,515
a great man.

468
00:45:24,755 --> 00:45:28,515
Not only was he
a model police officer...

469
00:45:28,595 --> 00:45:31,115
a brilliant detective...

470
00:45:33,194 --> 00:45:36,995
admired and respected
by his fellow officers...

471
00:45:37,074 --> 00:45:41,594
and all those
who were fortunate enough...

472
00:45:42,674 --> 00:45:44,074
enough...

473
00:45:44,794 --> 00:45:46,714
enough to know him...

474
00:45:47,794 --> 00:45:49,673
he was above all else...

475
00:45:52,234 --> 00:45:54,073
a modest man.

476
00:46:10,473 --> 00:46:14,352
His kind will not pass this way again...

477
00:46:14,433 --> 00:46:17,032
and our loss is surely...

478
00:46:18,952 --> 00:46:20,312
heaven's gain.

479
00:46:31,631 --> 00:46:33,631
Present arms!

480
00:46:34,511 --> 00:46:35,911
Fire!

481
00:46:51,150 --> 00:46:53,830
- Get rid of that woman.
- We'll talk about it later.

482
00:46:53,870 --> 00:46:57,110
I want your answer now
or I sue for divorce.

483
00:46:57,190 --> 00:47:00,230
- I'm warning you.
- Are you going to have me killed?

484
00:47:29,868 --> 00:47:31,269
Gentlemen...

485
00:47:33,228 --> 00:47:35,468
you will be relieved to know
that our friend in New York...

486
00:47:35,548 --> 00:47:38,908
was very impressed
by our little demonstration.

487
00:47:38,988 --> 00:47:40,907
It was a good idea, Guy.

488
00:47:40,988 --> 00:47:43,588
The Gannet transaction is on again.

489
00:47:43,627 --> 00:47:46,147
-The same delivery date?
-Unless there is something I don't know.

490
00:47:46,188 --> 00:47:49,508
I spoke to Hong Kong.
They say the Gannet's on schedule.

491
00:47:51,067 --> 00:47:53,707
Good. That means
that this time next week...

492
00:47:53,787 --> 00:47:57,066
we can declare ourselves
a very healthy dividend...

493
00:47:57,147 --> 00:48:00,226
Ietting our international colleagues
know that the French connection...

494
00:48:00,307 --> 00:48:02,186
is back in business.

495
00:48:03,067 --> 00:48:07,546
I'll be at the farm. I do not want to be
contacted except in extreme emergency.

496
00:48:08,746 --> 00:48:10,106
Meeting adjourned.

497
00:48:17,225 --> 00:48:20,945
Guy, stick around.
I might need you.

498
00:48:21,026 --> 00:48:22,386
Right.

499
00:48:24,945 --> 00:48:27,985
Miss Le Gree, would you come in
for a moment, please?

500
00:48:39,864 --> 00:48:41,504
What's wrong with you?

501
00:48:42,985 --> 00:48:46,464
- We have to stop seeing each other.
- Your wife?

502
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:50,784
That witch!
How long this time?

503
00:48:50,864 --> 00:48:52,864
I'm afraid permanently.

504
00:48:52,944 --> 00:48:55,464
Permanently?

505
00:48:56,583 --> 00:48:58,584
- Permanently?
- Yes.

506
00:48:58,663 --> 00:49:02,464
- She gave me an ultimatum.
- Like you have no choice in the matter.

507
00:49:02,503 --> 00:49:04,863
- I haven't.
- You have to. Get rid of her!

508
00:49:04,903 --> 00:49:07,743
- My own wife?
- Get rid of her. Out! Why can't you?

509
00:49:07,783 --> 00:49:09,703
She's got enough evidence
in her safety deposit box to ruin me.

510
00:49:09,783 --> 00:49:12,222
Her attorney has been told that
if anything accidental happens to her...

511
00:49:12,263 --> 00:49:14,142
to give her box
to the authorities.

512
00:49:14,182 --> 00:49:16,902
- Then get rid of the authorities.
- What do you think I am?

513
00:49:16,983 --> 00:49:19,782
Get rid of her attorney.

514
00:49:19,822 --> 00:49:23,782
- I couldn't afford the scandal.
- I'll show you a scandal.

515
00:49:23,863 --> 00:49:28,022
You know I don't love her.
I need her respectability.

516
00:49:28,102 --> 00:49:30,142
- Permanently?
- Yes!

517
00:49:30,222 --> 00:49:34,022
Six years together, just washed up?
Just over with?

518
00:49:34,102 --> 00:49:37,582
- I'm afraid so. I'm sorry.
- That's just wonderful, isn't it?

519
00:49:37,661 --> 00:49:40,781
You obviously can't go on
being my secretary.

520
00:49:40,862 --> 00:49:43,981
I have deposited a substantial amount
of money in your bank account--

521
00:49:44,061 --> 00:49:45,901
- I don't want your money.
- What do you want?

522
00:49:45,981 --> 00:49:47,901
I don't know what I want.

523
00:49:50,021 --> 00:49:51,900
But I'll think of something!

524
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:07,180
Leaving early?

525
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:09,380
Later than you think, Mr. Algo.

526
00:50:17,819 --> 00:50:19,859
Something you want me to do?

527
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:24,579
Not unless she decides
to be indiscreet.

528
00:50:24,659 --> 00:50:28,859
If you have to, be sure
you make it look like an accident.

529
00:50:34,619 --> 00:50:36,419
Ahoy!

530
00:50:36,498 --> 00:50:38,418
Ahoy, the skipper!

531
00:50:39,938 --> 00:50:42,938
Hello, up there in the fog.

532
00:50:53,897 --> 00:50:55,737
Don't worry.

533
00:50:55,777 --> 00:50:58,777
It's only an old salty
Swedish sea dog...

534
00:50:58,817 --> 00:51:01,737
out there from the salty seas,
you know.

535
00:51:04,897 --> 00:51:06,937
Pumpin' the air in the parrot.

536
00:51:09,737 --> 00:51:12,416
Naughty bird afraid of the fog.

537
00:51:22,216 --> 00:51:23,615
Swine leg.

538
00:51:30,415 --> 00:51:32,295
Hello, lnspector.

539
00:51:33,455 --> 00:51:35,575
Chief lnspector.

540
00:51:37,575 --> 00:51:41,255
I will keep under the covers.
No one must suspect a thing.

541
00:51:49,614 --> 00:51:52,254
What do you have of special interest...

542
00:51:52,334 --> 00:51:55,694
to my secret investigations?

543
00:51:55,774 --> 00:51:58,453
There's something big going down
at Le Club Foot.

544
00:51:59,293 --> 00:52:01,934
Le Club Foot? Remarkable.

545
00:52:02,014 --> 00:52:03,374
Keep your--

546
00:52:06,693 --> 00:52:08,693
Keep your eyes and ears peeled.

547
00:52:08,773 --> 00:52:10,813
Keep in constant contact.

548
00:52:10,893 --> 00:52:15,173
I am extremely grateful
for this excellent piece of information.

549
00:52:16,572 --> 00:52:18,892
Thar she blows!

550
00:52:20,733 --> 00:52:24,453
Once again, I thank you
for this most useful tip.

551
00:52:24,532 --> 00:52:28,492
And if there is anything
I can ever do to repay you--

552
00:52:28,572 --> 00:52:31,372
Now that you mention it,
Chief lnspector--

553
00:52:54,290 --> 00:52:57,610
Sixteen chests
on a dead man's rum

554
00:52:57,691 --> 00:53:00,811
Yo ho ho in the bottle
of the chest

555
00:53:00,890 --> 00:53:04,050
Drink to the devils
and some for the rum--

556
00:53:09,290 --> 00:53:11,130
Do it some more

557
00:53:11,210 --> 00:53:13,250
Yeah, give me some more

558
00:53:13,330 --> 00:53:16,170
All right

559
00:53:17,850 --> 00:53:20,290
Come on, yeah
Slide it

560
00:53:22,969 --> 00:53:24,689
Move 'em out

561
00:53:24,729 --> 00:53:26,649
Move 'em out

562
00:53:26,689 --> 00:53:30,129
If you mess around with women, boy
You wanna fix the trimmin'

563
00:53:33,889 --> 00:53:35,889
Better listen to me, cousin--

564
00:53:35,929 --> 00:53:38,009
She's coming in now.

565
00:53:42,168 --> 00:53:44,488
- Bonsoir, Vic.
- How you doing, Simone?

566
00:53:44,568 --> 00:53:46,648
Mr. Toledo, Mr. Vancouver.

567
00:53:46,728 --> 00:53:48,088
What's happening?

568
00:53:49,687 --> 00:53:51,887
You can show us to my usual table.

569
00:53:51,968 --> 00:53:54,208
How about something near the floor?
Easier for dancing.

570
00:53:54,288 --> 00:53:57,168
No, thank you.
I want my usual table.

571
00:54:02,807 --> 00:54:04,487
Is something wrong?

572
00:54:04,567 --> 00:54:07,087
It is Mr. Douvier's table,
ain't it, love?

573
00:54:07,127 --> 00:54:10,247
No, it really ain't, love, but if
you're worried about Mr. Douvier...

574
00:54:10,327 --> 00:54:12,167
why don't you give him a call?

575
00:54:12,247 --> 00:54:14,087
I wouldn't want you to get in trouble
with your boss.

576
00:54:14,167 --> 00:54:16,007
- He ain't my boss.
- He ain't?

577
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:18,207
Then why you paying him
all that money every month?

578
00:54:18,286 --> 00:54:21,806
- That ain't cool, baby.
- You ain't seen nothing yet. Come on.

579
00:54:31,171 --> 00:54:33,291
Where we going?

580
00:54:32,636 --> 00:54:35,516
We don't want to be obvious. We've got
to make our entrance through the back...

581
00:54:35,516 --> 00:54:38,676
in disguise,
as I told you, you fool.

582
00:55:39,163 --> 00:55:41,643
Get up here.

583
00:55:43,122 --> 00:55:46,162
- It's a bakery.
- I know that.

584
00:55:46,162 --> 00:55:50,003
Come on. At least
you're not yellow anymore.

585
00:55:50,123 --> 00:55:52,443
This time I'm going to stand
on your shoulders.

586
00:55:52,484 --> 00:55:54,644
What good would that do?

587
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:58,364
- Because I'm taller than you, you fool.
- Oh, yeah.

588
00:55:58,364 --> 00:56:00,284
Make a cradle.

589
00:56:03,445 --> 00:56:05,245
Get rid of that.

590
00:56:46,889 --> 00:56:48,808
I can't reach it.

591
00:56:48,849 --> 00:56:51,730
You'll have to find something
to stand on.

592
00:57:09,011 --> 00:57:12,131
All right! Let me see some, baby.
Come on.

593
00:57:12,171 --> 00:57:14,652
Do it, baby.

594
00:57:21,332 --> 00:57:22,852
Let me go!

595
00:57:25,052 --> 00:57:27,532
- Can you reach it?
- Yes.

596
00:57:44,014 --> 00:57:46,615
- Hey, are you okay?
- No.

597
00:57:46,694 --> 00:57:48,894
- You know something? You're terrific.
- What?

598
00:57:48,935 --> 00:57:52,335
You're terrific. You saved my life.
Come with me.

599
00:57:52,376 --> 00:57:54,415
- Where?
- Over here. I want to save your life.

600
00:57:54,536 --> 00:57:56,735
- Let's go. Come on.
- Oh, God.

601
00:58:10,337 --> 00:58:13,617
-Come with me before the killers see us.
-What killers?

602
00:58:13,737 --> 00:58:15,817
- I'll tell you at my apartment.
- What apartment?

603
00:58:15,937 --> 00:58:17,338
My apartment.

604
00:58:35,539 --> 00:58:37,859
Oh, my God!

605
00:58:37,899 --> 00:58:39,779
And mine, too.

606
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:41,740
I'm soaked to the skin.

607
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:45,981
Yes, I have received
considerable soak also.

608
00:58:51,181 --> 00:58:54,221
Get out of those wet clothes before
you catch your death of pneumonia.

609
00:58:54,221 --> 00:58:58,062
Yes. What shall I do with my coat?
I don't want to spoil your beautiful--

610
00:58:58,062 --> 00:59:01,342
Just put it down anywhere.
Put it on the floor. That's fine.

611
00:59:07,263 --> 00:59:08,623
Help yourself.

612
00:59:08,742 --> 00:59:11,503
I'm going to change.
I'll bring you a robe.

613
00:59:20,144 --> 00:59:22,584
I'm gonna put on some music.

614
00:59:31,945 --> 00:59:35,105
- You know, it's strange.
- What?

615
00:59:35,225 --> 00:59:38,105
I say, it's strange.

616
00:59:38,225 --> 00:59:40,186
Yes, I know.
And I said "what?"

617
00:59:40,306 --> 00:59:42,946
- You mean, what is strange?
- Yes.

618
00:59:44,706 --> 00:59:46,627
It's strange...

619
00:59:46,627 --> 00:59:51,147
that I have never yet
set foot in this building...

620
00:59:51,147 --> 00:59:55,548
but I have the distinct impression
that I have been here before.

621
00:59:56,907 --> 00:59:59,268
It's called deja vu.
I have it all the time.

622
00:59:59,347 --> 01:00:01,308
Yeah, deja vu.
Thank you.

623
01:00:01,308 --> 01:00:03,228
You're welcome.

624
01:00:03,348 --> 01:00:05,429
- You okay?
- Yes.

625
01:00:07,068 --> 01:00:08,989
That feels good.

626
01:00:10,509 --> 01:00:13,509
It's not going to do you much good
if you don't take your pants off.

627
01:00:13,509 --> 01:00:15,549
- What?
- Take your pants off.

628
01:00:15,590 --> 01:00:16,949
Forgot about those.

629
01:00:17,069 --> 01:00:18,989
Look at me.

630
01:00:18,989 --> 01:00:21,470
Look at my hands.
I'm shaking like a leaf.

631
01:00:21,630 --> 01:00:24,070
I can't stop shaking.
I know what it is.

632
01:00:24,190 --> 01:00:28,470
You know what it is?
I'm just not used to being killed.

633
01:00:28,590 --> 01:00:32,871
- That's my first time, you know?
- I know, but listen.

634
01:00:32,951 --> 01:00:37,791
When you have been killed as many times
as I have, you get used to it.

635
01:00:37,911 --> 01:00:40,672
- Really?
- Yes, oh, yes.

636
01:00:40,791 --> 01:00:43,511
Yes, indeed. I'll put this here.

637
01:00:43,552 --> 01:00:46,952
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

638
01:00:46,993 --> 01:00:50,672
- This is for you.
- Yes, of course.

639
01:00:50,792 --> 01:00:53,553
- Then this must be yours.
- Thank you. Cheers.

640
01:00:55,633 --> 01:00:56,993
Yes. Anyway--

641
01:00:59,474 --> 01:01:02,034
- You have nothing to fear.
- Yes, I have.

642
01:01:02,074 --> 01:01:03,994
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I have.

643
01:01:05,515 --> 01:01:10,595
No. You see, I am an officer
of the law.

644
01:01:10,675 --> 01:01:13,755
- The "lew"?
- What?

645
01:01:13,835 --> 01:01:17,716
You said you are an officer
of the "lew"?

646
01:01:17,716 --> 01:01:21,836
That is correct. Yes, yes.
I am Chief Inspector of the surete.

647
01:01:23,436 --> 01:01:25,117
What?

648
01:01:25,277 --> 01:01:27,437
You doubt me.

649
01:01:27,557 --> 01:01:31,556
No, I don't doubt you.
Why should I doubt you?

650
01:01:31,676 --> 01:01:34,677
- That's right. Why should you?
- If you say so, I don't.

651
01:01:34,718 --> 01:01:37,198
Who were those men
who tried to kill you?

652
01:01:37,198 --> 01:01:39,518
- Killers.
- How do you know?

653
01:01:39,678 --> 01:01:43,078
- Because they work for Douvier.
- Douvier? I know that name.

654
01:01:43,238 --> 01:01:46,478
Everyone in France knows that name.
He's a millionaire businessman.

655
01:01:46,518 --> 01:01:50,239
Yes, of course. Douvier the
millionaire businessman. I knew I knew.

656
01:01:50,359 --> 01:01:53,519
But, how many people
do you think know...

657
01:01:53,638 --> 01:01:58,039
that Douvier the millionaire businessman
is also Douvier the French connection?

658
01:01:58,159 --> 01:01:59,519
How many?

659
01:02:03,359 --> 01:02:05,880
I suppose his mother, for one.

660
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:08,040
Why do you suppose he wanted
to have me killed?

661
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:10,520
Elementary.
He wanted you dead.

662
01:02:15,721 --> 01:02:18,162
- You all right?
- I got singed.

663
01:02:18,202 --> 01:02:20,682
- I'm sorry about your robe.
- That's all right.

664
01:02:20,802 --> 01:02:23,122
Tell me about this Douvier.

665
01:02:24,922 --> 01:02:28,083
I was his mistress and
private secretary for two years.

666
01:02:28,083 --> 01:02:32,763
I know enough about Philippe to send him
to prison for his whole life.

667
01:02:35,643 --> 01:02:38,363
You keep talking about this Douvier.

668
01:02:39,483 --> 01:02:42,484
But who is Philippe?

669
01:02:42,604 --> 01:02:45,244
- Philippe Douvier.
- His son?

670
01:02:45,324 --> 01:02:47,125
Whose son? He has no son.

671
01:02:47,165 --> 01:02:49,364
- His brother then?
- His brother is Fred.

672
01:02:49,445 --> 01:02:51,684
- Then it has to be his father.
- His father's dead.

673
01:02:51,684 --> 01:02:53,605
Now we're getting somewhere.
Who killed him?

674
01:02:53,725 --> 01:02:57,845
- No one. He died of natural causes.
- Then who is this Philippe?

675
01:02:57,845 --> 01:03:01,285
I want to see some identification.
Right now.

676
01:03:01,405 --> 01:03:04,846
Right now.
I want to see some identification.

677
01:03:05,006 --> 01:03:08,286
If you're not a policeman, then I
shouldn't be telling you these things.

678
01:03:12,647 --> 01:03:15,967
- Can you keep a secret?
- I don't know. That depends.

679
01:03:17,727 --> 01:03:20,607
Brace yourself for what
I'm about to tell you.

680
01:03:21,448 --> 01:03:23,368
I am none other...

681
01:03:25,008 --> 01:03:28,729
then Staff lnspector
Jacques Clouseau.

682
01:03:28,808 --> 01:03:30,488
No, you're not.

683
01:03:30,649 --> 01:03:32,408
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not.

684
01:03:34,209 --> 01:03:35,849
I am.

685
01:03:35,969 --> 01:03:37,329
You're not.

686
01:03:41,889 --> 01:03:43,690
Yes, you are.

687
01:03:44,609 --> 01:03:46,010
Oh, my God!

688
01:03:46,010 --> 01:03:48,330
I admit it's not
a good photograph, but--

689
01:03:48,450 --> 01:03:51,371
But I saw your funeral on television.

690
01:03:51,450 --> 01:03:52,851
Yes. Yes.

691
01:03:53,011 --> 01:03:55,331
Even the pope was there.
Cheers.

692
01:03:56,571 --> 01:03:59,171
But if you're not dead, who's dead?

693
01:04:01,371 --> 01:04:04,211
A wandering transvestite
took my car...

694
01:04:04,251 --> 01:04:06,853
and stole my clothes at gunpoint.

695
01:04:06,972 --> 01:04:10,532
I have been working under the covers
tracking the killer.

696
01:04:10,573 --> 01:04:13,013
- The killer's Douvier!
- What?

697
01:04:13,173 --> 01:04:15,213
He wanted to impress the godfather.

698
01:04:16,734 --> 01:04:20,853
What? You mean Douvier killed
a wandering transvestite...

699
01:04:20,973 --> 01:04:23,573
just to impress his godfather?

700
01:04:24,654 --> 01:04:26,174
The man's unthinkable.

701
01:04:26,215 --> 01:04:27,974
The door.

702
01:04:27,974 --> 01:04:31,375
- What's wrong with it?
- I saw the knob turn.

703
01:04:56,897 --> 01:04:58,257
Hurry.

704
01:04:59,097 --> 01:05:01,297
- I wonder whose apartment this is.
- I don't know.

705
01:05:04,898 --> 01:05:07,218
The other one's probably upstairs
waiting in my room.

706
01:05:07,338 --> 01:05:09,538
How do you know there's another one?

707
01:05:09,538 --> 01:05:12,579
Because assassins always travel
in pairs. It's a company rule.

708
01:05:12,659 --> 01:05:14,739
Do you know what
the Gannet Transaction is?

709
01:05:14,859 --> 01:05:16,939
The Gannet Transaction? What is that?

710
01:05:17,059 --> 01:05:21,219
It's a code name for
a 50-million franc heroin sale.

711
01:05:21,299 --> 01:05:23,219
50 million francs?

712
01:05:23,260 --> 01:05:26,259
Philippe's going to Hong Kong on Tuesday
to meet with the American buyer.

713
01:05:26,420 --> 01:05:27,780
Hong Kong.

714
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:31,220
I don't know how it fits in,
but the Gannet's a boat.

715
01:05:38,580 --> 01:05:40,701
What are you doing?

716
01:05:43,381 --> 01:05:45,502
- I know why this place looks familiar.
- Why?

717
01:05:45,621 --> 01:05:47,542
Chief lnspector Dreyfus lives here.

718
01:05:52,062 --> 01:05:54,263
I think he has received a faint.

719
01:05:56,063 --> 01:05:58,943
Wake up, Chief lnspector.
Wake up.

720
01:05:59,063 --> 01:06:00,424
Chief lnspector?

721
01:06:01,264 --> 01:06:04,264
Hello? Are you in there,
Chief lnspector?

722
01:06:05,103 --> 01:06:06,464
Hello?

723
01:06:07,704 --> 01:06:10,865
There's no reply.
It's no use.

724
01:06:10,865 --> 01:06:12,785
We will have to go to Hong Kong
without him.

725
01:06:12,905 --> 01:06:14,664
- We?
- Yes.

726
01:06:14,704 --> 01:06:17,304
You, I and Cato,
who will translate for us.

727
01:06:17,425 --> 01:06:20,145
Not me. I am not going to Hong Kong.

728
01:06:20,186 --> 01:06:22,386
Are you kidding?
Douvier would shoot me on sight.

729
01:06:22,506 --> 01:06:24,986
Not if he doesn't recognize you.
And he won't.

730
01:06:25,106 --> 01:06:27,466
Why not?

731
01:06:27,466 --> 01:06:32,786
We will leave that
up to the great Balls.

732
01:06:32,827 --> 01:06:35,267
The great Balls?

733
01:06:36,387 --> 01:06:38,987
At your service!

734
01:06:39,108 --> 01:06:41,828
Please forgive the condition
of my establishment...

735
01:06:41,868 --> 01:06:44,588
but as the lnspector knows--

736
01:06:44,708 --> 01:06:47,468
- Chief lnspector knows--
- Auguste.

737
01:06:48,707 --> 01:06:50,508
So sorry. I beg your pardon.

738
01:06:50,628 --> 01:06:53,949
But as the Chief lnspector knows,
we were bombed.

739
01:06:54,069 --> 01:06:55,708
Sounds like you still are.

740
01:06:55,828 --> 01:06:59,269
Almost all my collection
was either destroyed or damaged.

741
01:06:59,389 --> 01:07:02,429
Starting Monday,
I have to have a fire sale.

742
01:07:03,390 --> 01:07:05,589
You could call it
"The Great Balls of Fire" sale.

743
01:07:05,589 --> 01:07:07,510
A catchy suggestion.

744
01:07:07,629 --> 01:07:08,990
Very good.

745
01:07:10,230 --> 01:07:11,590
Cunny!

746
01:07:17,670 --> 01:07:21,631
I can't tell you how good it is
to see that you are still alive.

747
01:07:21,751 --> 01:07:24,791
It has been my privilege
to serve the good lnspector...

748
01:07:24,791 --> 01:07:27,952
the Chief lnspector,
for, lo, this many years.

749
01:07:27,952 --> 01:07:30,272
Thirteen, to be precise.

750
01:07:30,272 --> 01:07:34,512
And his reported demise
was a real blow to me.

751
01:07:34,552 --> 01:07:36,552
Something's coming.

752
01:07:36,592 --> 01:07:39,353
Yes, Cunny, you are not dreaming.

753
01:07:39,473 --> 01:07:43,313
Our friend, our customer,
is alive!

754
01:07:43,313 --> 01:07:44,834
Hello, Cunny.

755
01:07:46,193 --> 01:07:49,594
Now, how can I serve you?

756
01:07:49,634 --> 01:07:52,914
Through wind and mud,
snow and hail...

757
01:07:52,914 --> 01:07:56,635
whether long or short,
dark or pale, remember...

758
01:07:56,755 --> 01:07:59,235
that when duty calls...

759
01:07:59,355 --> 01:08:01,395
you've got Balls.

760
01:08:04,835 --> 01:08:06,196
I gotta sit down.

761
01:08:06,236 --> 01:08:08,436
Yes, of course. Cunny! Quick.

762
01:08:08,515 --> 01:08:10,076
Please, please, please.

763
01:08:10,076 --> 01:08:12,396
Come along. That's right.
There you are.

764
01:08:12,516 --> 01:08:16,917
- Sit. Come, come, come. Sit, sit.
- You're not serious.

765
01:08:16,917 --> 01:08:19,517
There has been no time
to get new furniture.

766
01:08:19,517 --> 01:08:22,677
Believe me, since the blast,
he's much more comfortable.

767
01:08:22,797 --> 01:08:24,317
Please sit.

768
01:08:24,317 --> 01:08:26,757
Matter of fact,
I've been sleeping on him.

769
01:08:29,798 --> 01:08:31,198
Chief lnspector?

770
01:08:31,198 --> 01:08:33,918
I'm leaving for Hong Kong
in the morning.

771
01:08:34,078 --> 01:08:35,599
Hong Kong?

772
01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:39,518
Could you pick me up
some cheap coolie hats?

773
01:08:39,559 --> 01:08:43,119
My dear Auguste,
I need your best Hong Kong disguise.

774
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:47,119
Also, I will need something
extra special in the godfather line.

775
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:50,360
Doctor, please, you must help me.

776
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:52,560
Is Clouseau real...

777
01:08:52,601 --> 01:08:54,481
or am I going mad again?

778
01:08:54,521 --> 01:08:57,921
- What do you think?
- What do I think? What can I think?

779
01:08:57,961 --> 01:09:00,641
If that nincompoop is really alive...

780
01:09:00,681 --> 01:09:04,922
and the things I heard are true,
he'll probably be decorated again...

781
01:09:04,922 --> 01:09:07,682
for rounding up
the biggest drug ring in France...

782
01:09:07,682 --> 01:09:10,162
and I'll be a laughingstock.

783
01:09:10,282 --> 01:09:13,722
That sounds reasonable.
What are you going to do?

784
01:09:14,683 --> 01:09:16,723
What choice do I have?

785
01:09:16,843 --> 01:09:20,283
I either commit myself and come back
to be locked up in here...

786
01:09:21,963 --> 01:09:23,443
or...

787
01:09:24,403 --> 01:09:26,604
I go to Hong Kong.

788
01:09:56,606 --> 01:10:00,087
- I don't think I can do this.
- Of course you can.

789
01:10:00,087 --> 01:10:02,407
Just think yellow and follow me.

790
01:10:33,010 --> 01:10:37,930
"Mr. and Mrs. Low Key."

791
01:10:39,411 --> 01:10:42,611
You stupid lunk! What the hell
do you think you're doing?

792
01:10:42,731 --> 01:10:44,531
Absolutely ruined my suit!

793
01:10:44,651 --> 01:10:46,572
Why the hell don't you look
where you're going?

794
01:10:48,212 --> 01:10:52,052
I'm Mr. Algo. When Mr. Scallini arrives,
have me paged in the bar.

795
01:10:52,212 --> 01:10:54,252
Certainly, Mr. Algo.

796
01:10:55,332 --> 01:10:57,973
Who is gonna pay for my suit?

797
01:10:59,732 --> 01:11:01,533
See that man there?

798
01:11:01,653 --> 01:11:04,133
That's Guy Algo,
Philippe's right-hand man.

799
01:11:04,293 --> 01:11:06,613
This Scallini must be Mr. Big
from New York.

800
01:11:08,414 --> 01:11:10,854
Listen, we'll go up to the room.

801
01:11:10,974 --> 01:11:13,734
You stay here ten minutes,
then tell Mr.--

802
01:11:13,854 --> 01:11:16,774
- Algo.
- Right, yes. Algo.

803
01:11:16,854 --> 01:11:19,895
That Mr. You-Know-Who has arrived,
and bring him to the room.

804
01:11:19,935 --> 01:11:23,895
- Mr. You-Know-Who?
- Right. I will be Mr. You-Know-Who.

805
01:11:24,015 --> 01:11:25,815
Come, Ming Loy.

806
01:12:06,939 --> 01:12:09,419
You got a reservation for Scallini?

807
01:12:15,181 --> 01:12:17,941
Page Mr. Algo in the bar.
Tell him Mr. Scallini is here.

808
01:12:41,143 --> 01:12:44,423
- What do you think you're doing?
- Mr. Scallini in lobby.

809
01:14:15,632 --> 01:14:19,032
You heard what I said to him?
Dumb Frenchman.

810
01:14:19,073 --> 01:14:20,432
"Cochon."

811
01:14:20,552 --> 01:14:22,513
That means pig.

812
01:14:22,592 --> 01:14:25,632
I tell Mr. Scallini you're here.

813
01:14:34,154 --> 01:14:35,954
- Listen, boss--
- It's not boss. It's me!

814
01:14:36,074 --> 01:14:37,434
Where is he?

815
01:14:37,434 --> 01:14:39,354
In the bathroom getting into
his godfather disguise.

816
01:14:39,514 --> 01:14:42,795
Algo's in the next room. Scallini's
down the hall in the Tang suite.

817
01:14:42,795 --> 01:14:45,115
- Marvelous.
- We rode up in the same elevator.

818
01:14:45,115 --> 01:14:47,035
Maybe I can reach him
before he contacts Philippe.

819
01:14:47,035 --> 01:14:50,875
- What are you going to do?
- I'm not sure. Keep your eye on Algo.

820
01:15:15,598 --> 01:15:17,518
- Ice?
- Please.

821
01:15:21,759 --> 01:15:23,959
- Soda?
- Yes.

822
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:31,040
I hope it's not too strong.

823
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:33,239
I'm sure it will be fine.

824
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:40,280
Hey! Mama Mia.

825
01:15:41,241 --> 01:15:43,281
Spaghettini du AI Pacino!

826
01:15:44,961 --> 01:15:49,481
Carlo, Cato and me got a little business
to talk over.

827
01:15:49,481 --> 01:15:52,081
We won't be long.
Have another drink.

828
01:15:54,002 --> 01:15:55,362
Viva Zapata!

829
01:15:59,722 --> 01:16:02,082
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

830
01:16:07,403 --> 01:16:08,763
Get out--

831
01:16:10,283 --> 01:16:11,683
Hello, Mr. Marchione.

832
01:16:11,843 --> 01:16:15,124
- Hey. Come on in.
- Thank you.

833
01:16:15,124 --> 01:16:17,324
- Thank you very much.
- Can I get you a drink?

834
01:16:17,324 --> 01:16:19,244
No, nothing, thank you.

835
01:16:19,925 --> 01:16:21,684
It's Simone.

836
01:16:21,725 --> 01:16:23,724
You have a good memory.

837
01:16:23,764 --> 01:16:26,645
I never forget a pretty face.

838
01:16:26,645 --> 01:16:30,725
Boss, this is Simone.
That's Douvier's personal--

839
01:16:30,765 --> 01:16:33,085
Secretary. How do you do,
Mr. Scallini?

840
01:16:33,205 --> 01:16:36,646
We never met before.
If we meet before, you call me Julio.

841
01:16:37,766 --> 01:16:41,167
- That's a nice hand.
- Thank you. That's only the right one.

842
01:16:41,287 --> 01:16:43,487
- You type, too.
- 100 words a minute.

843
01:16:43,527 --> 01:16:45,406
I may faint.

844
01:16:45,447 --> 01:16:49,007
Mr. Douvier has asked me to apologize.
He's going to be a little late.

845
01:16:49,007 --> 01:16:51,447
If you like, I'd be happy
to keep you company until he arrives.

846
01:16:51,488 --> 01:16:54,088
If I like?
Does my mother cook spaghetti?

847
01:16:54,088 --> 01:16:56,368
To the Gannet Transaction.

848
01:17:03,409 --> 01:17:05,969
Shall I tell Douvier
we're on our way?

849
01:17:08,089 --> 01:17:10,009
Don't forget the money.

850
01:17:20,130 --> 01:17:21,650
What?

851
01:17:21,650 --> 01:17:24,210
Throat! Back!

852
01:17:25,451 --> 01:17:27,131
Choking!

853
01:17:27,291 --> 01:17:30,131
You want me to hit you on the back.

854
01:17:51,414 --> 01:17:53,333
We're on our way.

855
01:17:54,174 --> 01:17:57,174
- Mr. Douvier will meet us in the lobby.
- Yeah. Great.

856
01:17:57,334 --> 01:17:59,894
- Is that it?
- Yeah.

857
01:17:59,934 --> 01:18:01,854
50 million francs and no bodyguard?

858
01:18:01,974 --> 01:18:05,374
Listen, buddy, I take care of my body,
my body takes care of me.

859
01:18:05,414 --> 01:18:07,294
You know what I'm driving at?

860
01:18:15,856 --> 01:18:17,735
I'll buy some cigarettes, huh?

861
01:18:17,777 --> 01:18:21,016
Yeah, smoke a few. When Douvier shows,
I'll meet you in the lobby.

862
01:18:21,056 --> 01:18:22,416
Right.

863
01:19:16,062 --> 01:19:18,101
Be right with you.

864
01:19:50,185 --> 01:19:52,665
What the hell is going on here?

865
01:20:09,267 --> 01:20:11,067
Lee Kee shipyards.

866
01:20:17,668 --> 01:20:21,348
- Where'd he go?
- I think to Lee Kee shipyards.

867
01:20:41,510 --> 01:20:42,709
My cart!

868
01:20:43,591 --> 01:20:46,590
You see this? I can tell by
your heart line you're a passionate man.

869
01:20:46,590 --> 01:20:48,511
See how long this is?

870
01:20:48,511 --> 01:20:51,671
Keep watching.
It's going to get longer.

871
01:20:54,831 --> 01:20:57,432
- Hello.
- Lee Kee shipyards. Douvier.

872
01:20:57,432 --> 01:20:59,872
It was Douvier!

873
01:20:59,912 --> 01:21:04,272
The doorman heard him tell the driver
to go to the Lee Kee shipyard.

874
01:21:04,272 --> 01:21:07,153
Something is caccuzza around here.

875
01:21:09,072 --> 01:21:12,233
Your boss and a couple boys
just left the hotel.

876
01:21:12,233 --> 01:21:14,434
Really? I wonder why they did that?

877
01:21:14,594 --> 01:21:17,194
You got me.
Why don't we go ask him?

878
01:21:17,314 --> 01:21:21,034
Yes. Okay, I understand.

879
01:21:23,474 --> 01:21:25,954
Douvier left the hotel
about five minutes ago.

880
01:21:25,954 --> 01:21:30,195
He was with two men. He told the driver
to go to the Lee Kee shipyard.

881
01:21:30,195 --> 01:21:32,115
I'm sure it was that nincompoop.

882
01:21:37,315 --> 01:21:39,635
I'm sure Mr. Douvier didn't intend
to be gone very long.

883
01:21:39,676 --> 01:21:42,276
- We'll see.
- It doesn't make much sense.

884
01:21:42,276 --> 01:21:44,356
If you leave,
and then he comes back--

885
01:21:44,436 --> 01:21:47,196
Stop worrying.
You give yourself wrinkles.

886
01:21:53,677 --> 01:21:56,557
What about this Lee Kee shipyard?

887
01:21:56,557 --> 01:21:58,598
Perfectly legitimate
as far as I know.

888
01:21:58,718 --> 01:22:01,598
They build a line of
expensive power cruisers and sailboats.

889
01:22:01,638 --> 01:22:04,238
Maybe Mr. Douvier
is just buying himself a yacht.

890
01:22:11,919 --> 01:22:13,519
Lee Kee shipyards?

891
01:22:13,559 --> 01:22:15,439
Yeah, that's what
the como si chiamare said.

892
01:22:33,321 --> 01:22:34,961
Move it!

893
01:22:40,001 --> 01:22:41,802
Come along!

894
01:24:24,972 --> 01:24:27,292
This is Mr. Chow,
our Far Eastern representative.

895
01:24:27,292 --> 01:24:30,053
- Mr. Scallini.
- It's an honor to meet you.

896
01:24:30,053 --> 01:24:33,453
- You remember Mr. Algo. Shall we go?
- This way, please.

897
01:24:33,493 --> 01:24:35,813
After you launch the boat,
we'll go to Mr. Chow's office.

898
01:24:35,933 --> 01:24:38,133
You can sign the ownership papers.
Everything legal and aboveboard.

899
01:24:38,294 --> 01:24:40,334
Above the board. Good, good.

900
01:24:41,693 --> 01:24:45,374
- Where is it? You know--
- I understood you were told.

901
01:24:45,414 --> 01:24:49,134
No. I was told.
But I'm checking, you know.

902
01:24:50,614 --> 01:24:55,255
- In the keel.
- The old keel ploy. Yes.

903
01:24:55,295 --> 01:24:58,055
All you have to do is sail her
around the Caribbean for a while...

904
01:24:58,175 --> 01:25:01,455
haul her out of the water,
take the midsection out of the keel...

905
01:25:01,576 --> 01:25:04,616
and voila, 40 kilos
of the finest merchandise...

906
01:25:04,616 --> 01:25:06,936
your experts have ever tested.

907
01:25:07,096 --> 01:25:10,496
I'll tell you, it better hell be
the best merchandise...

908
01:25:10,536 --> 01:25:13,817
'cause my experts
certainly have tested some.

909
01:25:13,937 --> 01:25:16,537
- We have faith in our merchandise.
- That's good.

910
01:25:16,657 --> 01:25:19,298
All right. Now, would you like
to launch her?

911
01:25:19,298 --> 01:25:21,338
I would be delighted.

912
01:25:38,779 --> 01:25:42,459
September. A good month for the vintage.

913
01:25:46,180 --> 01:25:47,540
Congratulations!

914
01:26:02,622 --> 01:26:04,982
He must be a cop!
Get him! Get him!

915
01:26:06,062 --> 01:26:07,462
Hey, boss!

916
01:26:16,783 --> 01:26:19,104
Look out, you are an idiot!

917
01:26:22,544 --> 01:26:24,184
What are you doing?

918
01:27:24,550 --> 01:27:25,910
Jesus Christ!

919
01:27:30,710 --> 01:27:32,351
You crumb!

920
01:27:39,591 --> 01:27:42,511
Get back here, you slob!

921
01:27:45,671 --> 01:27:47,032
It's me!

922
01:27:47,032 --> 01:27:48,392
I know!

923
01:28:01,153 --> 01:28:02,353
Wait!

924
01:28:24,716 --> 01:28:27,916
Hey, cancel the artillery!

925
01:28:34,357 --> 01:28:37,637
I don't care! Get out of my way!

926
01:28:37,637 --> 01:28:41,077
- Al, where are you?
- How do I know?

927
01:28:42,277 --> 01:28:45,877
Wherever you are,
this is Chief lnspector Clouseau.

928
01:28:46,037 --> 01:28:48,638
I'm warning you
that if you are not careful...

929
01:28:48,638 --> 01:28:50,838
I will arrest you all
in the name of the law.

930
01:28:57,119 --> 01:29:00,960
You and your bright ideas.
Let me get my hands on you.

931
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:02,359
Clouseau?

932
01:29:03,280 --> 01:29:05,319
Yes?

933
01:29:05,359 --> 01:29:08,120
- Are you wounded?
- No.

934
01:29:08,200 --> 01:29:11,400
Fortunately I was saved
by the darkness.

935
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:13,721
So what we need is more light.

936
01:29:19,761 --> 01:29:21,841
Look what you did to my shoes!

937
01:29:54,325 --> 01:29:55,724
Hello, Philippe.

938
01:29:56,805 --> 01:29:59,125
Simone, what the hell
are you doing here?

939
01:29:59,245 --> 01:30:01,205
I'm waiting for the firecrackers
to go off.

940
01:30:01,285 --> 01:30:04,605
- What firecrackers?
- The ones I stuck in your pants.

941
01:32:28,780 --> 01:32:32,100
Hello.
I'm sorry I'm late.

942
01:32:32,180 --> 01:32:36,741
I had some important police business
to attend to, you know.

943
01:32:36,741 --> 01:32:39,341
- Everything's all right?
- Yes, absolutely fine.

944
01:32:39,461 --> 01:32:41,541
Allow me to let you in the car.

945
01:32:41,701 --> 01:32:43,461
Please.

946
01:32:43,622 --> 01:32:46,222
- It's beautiful.
- It's rather neat, isn't it?

947
01:32:46,222 --> 01:32:48,142
I call it the Silver Hornet.

948
01:32:57,182 --> 01:32:58,583
Yes.

949
01:33:00,583 --> 01:33:03,743
It's a little overdue for service,
unfortunately.

950
01:33:07,904 --> 01:33:10,624
Perhaps it's better
to leave that there.

951
01:33:11,744 --> 01:33:13,744
It's a beautiful night.
Why don't we walk?

952
01:33:13,784 --> 01:33:15,704
What an excellent idea.

953
01:33:16,504 --> 01:33:19,384
- I'm sorry about that.
- It's quite all right.

954
01:33:19,424 --> 01:33:21,464
You look ravishing tonight.

955
01:33:21,584 --> 01:33:24,065
- Yes, I know that.
- You know that?

956
01:33:24,184 --> 01:33:26,105
I knew that you knew that.

957
01:33:26,145 --> 01:33:28,066
You did? I knew you knew
I knew that.

958
01:33:28,185 --> 01:33:30,386
What made you decide
to become a detective?

959
01:33:30,386 --> 01:33:34,786
It's not something one decides
every day of the week, you know.

960
01:33:34,786 --> 01:33:38,226
But in my case, it began
when my great aunt was kidnapped...

961
01:33:38,346 --> 01:33:42,867
and held for ransom
by an unlicensed Armenian phrenologist.

962
01:33:42,987 --> 01:33:44,947
An Armenian phrenologist?

963
01:33:45,027 --> 01:33:49,308
Yes, you know. A man who reads
the "bimps" on the head.

964
01:33:49,308 --> 01:33:51,788
- The "bimps"?
- What?
