- Hey.

00:01:59,648 --> 00:02:00,808
- Is that me?
- Yeah.

3
00:02:00,916 --> 00:02:02,781
You'd turn up late
for your own funeral, wouldn't ya?

4
00:02:02,885 --> 00:02:05,445
Couldn't find my passport.
Better late tonight than tomorrow.

5
00:02:05,554 --> 00:02:06,953
- Good to see you, man.
- Where's the girls?

6
00:02:07,056 --> 00:02:09,183
In the toilet.
You packed? You all set?

7
00:02:09,291 --> 00:02:10,485
Yeah. You nervous?

8
00:02:10,893 --> 00:02:12,326
- No.
- Good.

9
00:02:12,428 --> 00:02:15,727
- To Kurdistan.
- To Kurdistan. Slainte.

10
00:02:17,532 --> 00:02:19,432
Hey, love.
How are you?

11
00:02:19,868 --> 00:02:22,234
- You packed? Yeah?
- Ready to go.

12
00:02:22,337 --> 00:02:23,668
How's it going?

13
00:02:24,472 --> 00:02:26,303
- Any action?
- God, I hope not.

14
00:02:26,407 --> 00:02:27,772
Running out of time.

15
00:02:27,876 --> 00:02:29,639
- Seat's in the corner. Let's get it.
- Yeah.

16
00:02:29,744 --> 00:02:31,541
Yeah, yeah.

17
00:02:34,983 --> 00:02:36,211
How are you?

18
00:02:36,384 --> 00:02:37,749
It's not my fault.

19
00:02:37,852 --> 00:02:40,252
I'm not pointing a finger.

20
00:02:43,724 --> 00:02:46,921
So, quiet tonight?

21
00:02:47,094 --> 00:02:48,686
Yeah. Think so.

22
00:02:48,796 --> 00:02:50,320
- Think it's sad.
- Sad?

23
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:53,456
- Yeah, you're going.
- Geez, the guilt.

24
00:02:53,634 --> 00:02:55,727
Ladle it on.

25
00:02:55,836 --> 00:02:58,100
Anyway,
we've decided some names.

26
00:02:58,205 --> 00:02:59,695
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

27
00:02:59,873 --> 00:03:02,467
If it's a girl, she'll be Morna.

28
00:03:03,277 --> 00:03:05,006
- Morna.
- It means "beloved."

29
00:03:05,112 --> 00:03:06,670
- It's nice.
- Yeah.

30
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:07,804
And if it's a boy?

31
00:03:12,351 --> 00:03:16,481
Well, it was a tough one,
but we finally agreed on Mark.

32
00:03:16,656 --> 00:03:19,181
- You're joking.
- Nope.

33
00:03:19,292 --> 00:03:21,419
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

34
00:03:21,928 --> 00:03:22,917
Curse the child!

00:03:24,597 --> 00:03:26,155

Yeah.

All right, come on.

00:05:13,435 --> 00:05:15,062
- Dr. Talzani.
- Mr. Walsh.

00:05:15,237 --> 00:05:17,262
- How are you?
- Busy. Go.

David!

- Yeah.

I thought you guys
are used to this kind of thing.

50
00:05:37,525 --> 00:05:38,719
How can anyone get used to this?

51
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,893
Well, considering we have
no ventilation, no running water,

52
00:05:42,997 --> 00:05:45,397
and no medicine,
I'd say we are doing pretty good.

53
00:05:45,499 --> 00:05:47,626
Dr. Talzani, this is my friend David.

54
00:05:47,735 --> 00:05:49,862
Nice to meet you.

55
00:05:50,037 --> 00:05:52,334
- All right, you know the rules.
- No flash.

56
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:54,634
Keep out of your way.

- Feeling better now?
- Yeah.

60
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:18,879
All right. You do look like shit.

61
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,572
I think you're getting too old
for this gig.

62
00:08:20,748 --> 00:08:21,772
Now, that's funny.

63
00:08:23,184 --> 00:08:25,652
I'm going home, Mark.

64
00:08:25,753 --> 00:08:28,278
Yeah, me too. Soon.

65
00:08:28,456 --> 00:08:29,423
I want to go now.

66
00:08:31,092 --> 00:08:31,990
Tomorrow.

67
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:34,593
I've had enough.
And Diane's due in two weeks.

If I'm not back in time...

69
00:08:35,996 --> 00:08:38,988
I know.
What about the offensive?

70
00:08:39,099 --> 00:08:40,157
What about it?

71
00:08:40,267 --> 00:08:44,431
Well, it looks like
they're finally gonna go.

72
00:08:44,605 --> 00:08:47,438
They've been saying that
ever since we got here.

73
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:50,840
These people have been launching
offensives for, what, two centuries?

74
00:08:50,944 --> 00:08:53,845
Two centuries from now,
they'll still be launching them.

We miss this one,
we catch the next.

Ah, shite, here we go.

- Mm, yep.

80
00:09:10,229 --> 00:09:12,595
All right.
Let's go get some shots.

81
00:09:12,765 --> 00:09:14,130
Come on.

82
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,131
Do you have an extra cigarette?

You know...

86
00:10:45,588 --> 00:10:50,889
In my lifetime alone,
we had eight wars.

87
00:10:50,993 --> 00:10:53,223
Two with the Turks,
three with Iranians,

88
00:10:53,328 --> 00:10:56,263
and three with Iraqis.

89
00:10:56,365 --> 00:10:59,198
And if I go back
to when my father was alive,

90
00:10:59,301 --> 00:11:01,166
or my father's father,

91
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:02,965
each time we've been beaten.

92
00:11:03,138 --> 00:11:05,698
That's what we Kurds do best,
get beaten.

93
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:07,034
So why do you stay?

94
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:10,039
Where am I to go, Mr. Walsh?

95
00:11:12,247 --> 00:11:13,543
They talk of free will,

96
00:11:13,648 --> 00:11:17,379
but we are all just homing pigeons
in the end.

97
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,648
You should leave soon,
you and your friend.

98
00:11:22,757 --> 00:11:24,418
The offensive starts in two days,

99
00:11:24,525 --> 00:11:26,925
and when it happens,
it will be very hard to leave.

100
00:11:27,094 --> 00:11:29,995
Well, we don't want to leave.

101
00:11:30,097 --> 00:11:33,294
That's why we're here, Doctor.

102
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:34,834
Can you get us a place on board?

103
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:37,260
Do you ever stop?

104
00:11:42,976 --> 00:11:45,536
I must go.
I'll see if I can do something.

105
00:11:45,645 --> 00:11:46,304
Thank you.

106
00:11:56,122 --> 00:11:57,612
There's an Iraqi outpost there,

107
00:11:57,724 --> 00:11:59,919
and the only way to re-supply it
is by convoy through this valley.

108
00:12:00,026 --> 00:12:01,755
So they'll be sitting ducks
for an ambush.

109
00:12:01,861 --> 00:12:03,522
Talzani found us two places
on the truck.

110
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:04,892
- Has he?
- Yeah.

111
00:12:04,998 --> 00:12:06,727
So we go along for that,
and then come back here,

112
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:09,392
jump in a Jeep to the border,
we'll be in Turkey by that night.

113
00:12:09,501 --> 00:12:12,265
- What do you think?
- That's cutting it too close.

114
00:12:12,438 --> 00:12:15,032
How? We'll be home by Tuesday,
Wednesday night at the latest.

115
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:17,802
That's a week and a half
before the baby's due.

116
00:12:17,976 --> 00:12:20,206
Oh, come on, Mark,
what the hell does that mean?

117
00:12:20,312 --> 00:12:22,143
Babies are born early all the time.

118
00:12:26,318 --> 00:12:29,583
- So what if the Iraqis hit back hard?
- That's not gonna happen.

119
00:12:29,688 --> 00:12:30,882
It'll be days, it'll be weeks

120
00:12:30,989 --> 00:12:33,514
probably before the Iraqis
come back into the mountains.

121
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:34,989
How do you know that?

122
00:12:35,093 --> 00:12:37,425
Because Saddam doesn't give
a fuck about the Kurds.

123
00:12:37,595 --> 00:12:39,927
They'll come back into the mountains
just to prove a point.

124
00:12:40,031 --> 00:12:40,963
Massacre them.

125
00:12:41,065 --> 00:12:43,397
He doesn't fucking care about them,
though he cares about the flats.

126
00:12:43,501 --> 00:12:44,468
Oil fields.

127
00:12:44,569 --> 00:12:46,434
First order of business,
reclaim the oil fields...

128
00:12:46,604 --> 00:12:49,505
Reclaim the oil fields? The Kurd's
haven't even taken them yet.

129
00:12:49,607 --> 00:12:51,939
What if they don't? What then?

130
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:53,634
Jesus Christ, man,
you're making it hard.

131
00:12:53,745 --> 00:12:55,770
Look, we've been here
what, nearly a month at this stage?

132
00:12:55,947 --> 00:12:57,505
Yeah.

133
00:12:57,648 --> 00:12:59,639
And what have we got? Some shots
of Dr. Talzani and the triage.

134
00:12:59,817 --> 00:13:01,841
We've got some schoolchildren
saluting the rebel flag.

135
00:13:01,952 --> 00:13:03,715
Got some fucking
Pesh Merga running drills?

136
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:04,684
It's all good stuff.

137
00:13:04,788 --> 00:13:07,086
It's all good stuff, man,
but it's not why I came here.

138
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:09,317
We haven't got the story.

139
00:13:10,894 --> 00:13:12,361
Look, if this offensive goes off,

140
00:13:12,462 --> 00:13:13,861
Kurdistan will be
hitting the headlines

141
00:13:13,964 --> 00:13:15,022
just about the time we get home.

142
00:13:15,132 --> 00:13:16,497
And we're the only
two photographers here.

143
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,000
There's no reason
why we don't get those shots.

144
00:13:20,837 --> 00:13:23,533
Fucking hell.

145
00:13:24,207 --> 00:13:26,334
I can see it now.

146
00:13:27,277 --> 00:13:28,937
Boys, welcome back.
How was it?

147
00:13:29,044 --> 00:13:30,068
It was grand!

148
00:13:30,179 --> 00:13:31,669
So what shots have you got?

149
00:13:31,781 --> 00:13:32,645
Shots of what, the offensive?

150
00:13:32,748 --> 00:13:33,407
Fuck the offensive.

151
00:13:33,516 --> 00:13:35,211
Look, we've got schoolchildren.
They're very cute.

152
00:13:35,384 --> 00:13:36,544
Okay, Mark, I get the picture.

153
00:13:39,822 --> 00:13:41,346
Two more days, man.

154
00:13:42,892 --> 00:13:45,224
- You know what the worst of this is?
- What?

155
00:13:45,327 --> 00:13:49,457
The food. The fucking food.
I mean, take a look at these beans.

156
00:13:49,565 --> 00:13:51,692
Why do war zones
always have such miserable food?

157
00:13:51,801 --> 00:13:53,962
And you being a Scotsman,
you'd know about cuisine, would you?

158
00:13:54,136 --> 00:13:54,897
Oh, here we go.

159
00:13:55,003 --> 00:13:58,268
Your entire menu looks like
it was made in a fucking war zone.

160
00:13:58,373 --> 00:13:59,533
And by the way,
that's what your kid's

161
00:13:59,641 --> 00:14:00,801
going to be eating
for the rest of his life

00:14:00,909 --> 00:14:02,171
if we don't bring back
some decent pictures.

163
00:14:02,343 --> 00:14:04,368
You're worse than a pit bull.
Do you know that?

164
00:14:04,479 --> 00:14:06,845
Has anyone ever managed
to say no to you?

165
00:14:06,948 --> 00:14:09,143
Let's say we hope
for a war in France.

166
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,013
Nice food, close to home.

167
00:14:11,186 --> 00:14:13,620
The only thing is, knowing the French
it'd be over in less than a week.

168
00:14:14,355 --> 00:14:16,516
After this, I switch
to fashion photography.

169
00:14:21,829 --> 00:14:24,229
Two more days, then.
But no more.

170
00:14:24,331 --> 00:14:26,026
And if they come back tomorrow
and say "Just another..."

171
00:14:26,133 --> 00:14:28,795
Then we go. No questions asked.
Absolutely.

172
00:14:28,969 --> 00:14:29,936
Okay.

173
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:32,094
Good man, fair play.

174
00:14:36,643 --> 00:14:40,306
I cannot believe
I've been talked into it again.

175
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,771
Mark!

176
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:19,108
Where the fuck are you going?

177
00:15:29,194 --> 00:15:31,788
[In Kurdish]
Cease fire!

178
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:38,668
What's happened?

179
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:40,067
- We go!
- Go base?

180
00:15:40,171 --> 00:15:41,570
No base.
No, we're going Iraq.

181
00:15:41,673 --> 00:15:44,232
- Iraqi fort?
- Yes. We go.

182
00:15:45,009 --> 00:15:46,704
You all right?

183
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:50,512
What was all that about?!

184
00:15:52,383 --> 00:15:54,874
I can't do this anymore, man.

185
00:15:55,052 --> 00:15:56,178
There's been a change in plans.

186
00:15:56,287 --> 00:15:58,414
They're not going back to base,
they're going to hit the Iraqi fort.

187
00:15:58,522 --> 00:15:59,113
What?

188
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:00,416
They're gonna go up there
in the truck.

189
00:16:00,524 --> 00:16:02,389
- The Iraqis'll think it's a convoy...
- What, we going? No, no, no.

190
00:16:02,493 --> 00:16:05,155
Look, David! We've no choice, man!
We're along for the ride, remember?

191
00:16:05,262 --> 00:16:08,561
Along for the fucking ride?!
What are you saying?

192
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:10,633
Listen to yourself!

193
00:16:10,733 --> 00:16:13,463
It's another day, then another day,
then another day,

194
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:14,867
and I can't do it!

195
00:16:20,076 --> 00:16:21,668
I'm going home, man!

196
00:16:23,913 --> 00:16:25,278
David.

197
00:16:25,381 --> 00:16:27,212
What the fuck are you gonna do,
walk home?!

198
00:16:27,317 --> 00:16:30,684
It's 20 fucking miles back to base!

199
00:16:31,521 --> 00:16:32,988
Just don't get it, do you?

200
00:16:33,156 --> 00:16:35,056
I don't care.

201
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:38,289
- David!
- I'm going home.

202
00:16:40,362 --> 00:16:41,920
Fuck! David!

203
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:44,760
Mr. Walsh, are you coming?

204
00:17:41,488 --> 00:17:43,285
Mr. Walsh?

205
00:17:45,592 --> 00:17:49,426
They found you down by the river.
Do you remember that?

206
00:17:57,369 --> 00:18:00,270
He says you can't walk.
Is that so?

207
00:18:01,473 --> 00:18:05,466
Not sure. I, um, just woke up.

208
00:18:06,311 --> 00:18:07,903
Does it hurt?

209
00:18:09,782 --> 00:18:12,808
- So you can feel it?
- Yeah.

210
00:18:17,022 --> 00:18:17,818
No pain?

211
00:18:20,392 --> 00:18:22,189
Can you move your arms?

212
00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:25,222
Your legs?

213
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:29,328
Very good.

214
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:35,638
A head wound as well?

215
00:18:39,343 --> 00:18:41,174
Flesh wound.

216
00:18:41,345 --> 00:18:44,837
Maybe concussion,
but no skull fracture.

217
00:18:45,016 --> 00:18:48,975
Kurdistan is not a good place
for skull fracture.

218
00:18:49,087 --> 00:18:50,519
Well...

219
00:18:53,056 --> 00:18:57,186
You took quite a jolt,
but you're not paralyzed.

220
00:18:57,294 --> 00:19:00,559
And it seems
there are no broken bones.

221
00:19:00,664 --> 00:19:03,690
Legs will be the biggest problem.

222
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:07,566
That's always the case.
Legs, legs, legs...

223
00:19:08,238 --> 00:19:10,672
For every arm
I've amputated up here,

224
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:13,368
I've probably taken 10 legs.

225
00:19:13,543 --> 00:19:15,636
Strange, isn't it?

226
00:19:15,746 --> 00:19:20,182
Human legs are just not designed
for modern war.

227
00:19:26,956 --> 00:19:30,357
Take it easy. Get some rest.

228
00:19:30,526 --> 00:19:35,259
You have some neural disruption
but, Inshallah, it's only temporary.

229
00:19:37,299 --> 00:19:39,733
You're going to be right.

230
00:20:39,492 --> 00:20:41,517
How do you feel?

231
00:20:42,161 --> 00:20:42,991
Geez.

232
00:20:45,031 --> 00:20:47,158
Scared me.

233
00:20:49,602 --> 00:20:50,432
Better.

234
00:20:50,603 --> 00:20:52,833
Only a little bit of pain.

235
00:20:52,939 --> 00:20:56,602
Excellent. Pain is always
preferable to numbness.

236
00:20:56,776 --> 00:20:59,540
You were lucky, Mr. Walsh.
Really lucky.

237
00:20:59,645 --> 00:21:01,909
If there'd been any complications...

238
00:21:02,014 --> 00:21:03,140
What?

239
00:21:04,249 --> 00:21:05,477
You would have shot me?

240
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:11,054
Yeah. For your own good.
To stop you from suffering.

241
00:21:12,424 --> 00:21:16,417
And what about your friend?
He never came to visit you.

242
00:21:16,528 --> 00:21:19,725
He wouldn't even know I'm here.

243
00:21:21,132 --> 00:21:24,659
He left the day before it happened.

244
00:21:24,769 --> 00:21:27,704
First day of the offensive.

245
00:21:27,806 --> 00:21:29,364
Smart man.

246
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:33,601
You war people,
you all think you're immortal.

247
00:21:33,711 --> 00:21:35,702
Probably not good for morale

248
00:21:35,813 --> 00:21:38,247
to see a colleague
end up in Harir cave.

249
00:21:40,251 --> 00:21:42,879
That's all I can find.

250
00:21:42,987 --> 00:21:44,181
I hope they fit.

251
00:22:54,021 --> 00:22:58,890
Oh, Mr. Walsh.
You're making progress.

252
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:04,625
What do you think?

253
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,597
How many doctors in the world
have to clean their gun?

254
00:23:07,768 --> 00:23:09,929
You should sterilize it, too.

255
00:23:10,104 --> 00:23:12,595
Oh, sarcasm is back.

256
00:23:12,773 --> 00:23:14,434
Great.

257
00:23:17,211 --> 00:23:19,110
You must have a lot of regret.

258
00:23:23,483 --> 00:23:25,576
Regret what, Mr. Walsh?

259
00:23:27,253 --> 00:23:30,313
That I spared them
a few days of terrible suffering

260
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:36,087
'cause I have no way of saving them
or easing the unbearable pain?

261
00:23:36,196 --> 00:23:40,132
Do you think I kill those poor men
because I enjoy it?

262
00:23:41,234 --> 00:23:43,930
Geez, no.

263
00:23:49,942 --> 00:23:52,911
In quiet times,

264
00:23:53,012 --> 00:23:57,949
when there is not a lot of fighting
and I have more time,

265
00:23:58,050 --> 00:24:00,075
I give out very few blues.

266
00:24:00,252 --> 00:24:05,690
But when there is a lot of fighting,
a lot of wounded coming in...

267
00:24:05,791 --> 00:24:07,622
No.

268
00:24:08,494 --> 00:24:12,054
I have to think of those
I can still save.

269
00:24:21,339 --> 00:24:22,863
That's the one.

270
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:29,612
Some live, some die,
that's the only way to look at it.

271
00:24:29,714 --> 00:24:31,375
[In Kurdish]
Thank you.

272
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:35,019
Anything else is just arrogance,

273
00:24:35,186 --> 00:24:40,282
the arrogance of imagining
you can do something to change it.

274
00:24:45,395 --> 00:24:48,296
I'm sure they lecture against this
in medical school,

275
00:24:48,398 --> 00:24:50,696
smoking in operating room.

276
00:24:50,867 --> 00:24:52,698
I think you'll get away
with it tonight.

277
00:24:53,603 --> 00:24:56,367
Do you know
what Pesh Merga means?

278
00:24:57,974 --> 00:25:00,841
It means, "those who face death."

279
00:25:02,512 --> 00:25:04,503
Romantic.

280
00:25:06,248 --> 00:25:08,546
Poetic, even.

281
00:25:08,651 --> 00:25:11,518
Personally, I've never seen
one face death.

282
00:25:11,687 --> 00:25:14,679
They all turn away at the end.

283
00:25:23,032 --> 00:25:26,229
A Jeep is leaving tomorrow morning
for the frontier.

284
00:25:26,402 --> 00:25:29,633
- Why?
- The offensive has been discussed.

285
00:25:29,805 --> 00:25:32,365
You better leave while you can.

286
00:25:46,287 --> 00:25:48,346
Set to go?

287
00:25:50,158 --> 00:25:51,250
Yep.

288
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:54,726
Ah, it's much better.

289
00:25:55,563 --> 00:25:57,087
I guess it's yours.

290
00:25:58,199 --> 00:26:00,257
You're joking me.

291
00:26:02,703 --> 00:26:04,694
I hope you had an enjoyable visit.

292
00:26:05,405 --> 00:26:07,600
A lovely trip.

293
00:26:07,708 --> 00:26:10,370
Don't know why you don't get
more tourists over in these parts.

294
00:26:11,912 --> 00:26:14,813
I'm sorry. It's very Kurdish.

295
00:26:14,915 --> 00:26:18,180
It's a point of honor
to make sure strangers are content.

296
00:26:18,318 --> 00:26:21,082
Well, in that case, just think of me
as another happy customer.

297
00:26:22,389 --> 00:26:24,516
Dr. Talzani.

298
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:26,819
Thank you so much.

299
00:26:26,926 --> 00:26:28,291
Pleasure is mine.

300
00:26:28,394 --> 00:26:31,557
Mr. Walsh, good luck.

301
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,300
Oh!

302
00:28:26,408 --> 00:28:27,375
Oh!

303
00:28:30,712 --> 00:28:32,373
No, whoa, whoa, whoa.

304
00:28:32,547 --> 00:28:34,037
Easy, easy, easy.

305
00:28:37,352 --> 00:28:39,820
Oh! Dios mio!
What happened to you?

306
00:28:39,921 --> 00:28:40,852
Oh, it was dark.

307
00:28:40,955 --> 00:28:45,756
I fell into a river and got dragged
over some rocks a bit, banged up.

308
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:47,350
Just another day at the office.

309
00:28:47,528 --> 00:28:49,826
Why didn't you call me
to say you're coming?

310
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:53,161
'Cause I had a quick connection
from Istanbul.

311
00:28:56,037 --> 00:28:59,268
Well, what's this?
What do we got here?

312
00:28:59,373 --> 00:29:00,203
You like it?

313
00:29:00,308 --> 00:29:01,775
Yeah, I love it
when you go shopping

314
00:29:01,876 --> 00:29:04,140
and then, all of a sudden, presto!

315
00:29:04,245 --> 00:29:07,941
There's something there
that makes the place less... simple.

316
00:29:08,048 --> 00:29:09,845
You mean monastic?

317
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:11,347
No, simple.

318
00:29:11,451 --> 00:29:13,749
We had nowhere to sit.

319
00:29:15,021 --> 00:29:16,420
- I'll take it back if you want.
- No, no.

320
00:29:16,589 --> 00:29:19,023
Jesus, baby. I'm joking, I'm joking.
I love it.

321
00:29:19,125 --> 00:29:20,990
Well, I don't love it,
but I'll get used to it.

322
00:29:22,128 --> 00:29:23,925
I'm just tired.

323
00:29:24,097 --> 00:29:25,860
Come on, I'll throw you a bath.

324
00:29:25,965 --> 00:29:27,626
Okay.

325
00:29:28,535 --> 00:29:31,993
By the way,
I love your new style.

326
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,102
Hey.

327
00:30:10,675 --> 00:30:13,439
Oh, my God.

328
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:26,685
Mark, stand up.
Let me dry you off.

329
00:30:26,791 --> 00:30:28,917
Come on, baby.

330
00:30:30,927 --> 00:30:32,656
Missed you.

331
00:30:56,819 --> 00:31:00,016
Morning, sunshine. I don't think
I've ever been that tired.

332
00:31:00,189 --> 00:31:02,680
I can't even remember
getting out of the bath.

333
00:31:07,863 --> 00:31:12,664
Mi amor. What happened to you?
You're all black and blue.

334
00:31:12,835 --> 00:31:14,393
I told you. I'm an idiot.

335
00:31:14,503 --> 00:31:16,494
Fell into a river
and got dragged over some rocks.

336
00:31:16,605 --> 00:31:18,732
You got all that from some rocks?

337
00:31:19,575 --> 00:31:22,441
It's a strong river, love.

338
00:31:26,848 --> 00:31:29,942
Diane called.
David didn't come back with you?

339
00:31:30,118 --> 00:31:33,849
No. We split up the first day
of the offensive.

340
00:31:33,955 --> 00:31:35,650
He wanted to get back.

341
00:31:36,658 --> 00:31:38,285
What, do you mean
he's not back yet?

342
00:31:38,393 --> 00:31:39,553
No.

343
00:31:39,661 --> 00:31:41,686
That doesn't make sense.

344
00:31:41,796 --> 00:31:45,288
He should've been back
four or five days ago.

345
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,561
Should we be worried?

346
00:31:48,802 --> 00:31:50,497
No.

347
00:31:50,604 --> 00:31:52,902
No. He probably just got cut off
by the Iraqis.

348
00:31:53,006 --> 00:31:56,942
- They came back in fairly hard.
- Well, that's pretty worrisome.

349
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:58,668
David knows what to do.

350
00:31:58,779 --> 00:32:02,374
He'll just lay low for a while,
find another way out.

351
00:32:02,549 --> 00:32:04,574
You know Diane is due
in a week or so.

352
00:32:04,685 --> 00:32:07,381
- What if David isn't back by then?
- He'll be back by then.

353
00:32:07,488 --> 00:32:09,820
He wouldn't miss it for the world.
It's all he talked about over there.

354
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:13,221
- Yeah, but imagine what if he isn't?
- I don't know.

355
00:32:16,929 --> 00:32:20,126
What, do you want me
to go back over and find him?

356
00:32:20,233 --> 00:32:21,291
Is that what you want?

357
00:32:22,335 --> 00:32:24,098
No.

358
00:32:24,203 --> 00:32:27,263
No, carino. Of course not.

359
00:32:27,773 --> 00:32:29,673
I just...

360
00:32:30,776 --> 00:32:33,643
I just wonder sometimes
if you guys even think about us

361
00:32:33,746 --> 00:32:35,373
when you're out there?

362
00:32:35,481 --> 00:32:37,176
That's all.

363
00:32:37,283 --> 00:32:38,614
I think about you on the way out,

364
00:32:38,718 --> 00:32:40,913
and I think about you
on the way back.

365
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:43,078
I try not to think about you
out there.

366
00:32:43,188 --> 00:32:44,382
Just makes it too hard.

367
00:32:50,228 --> 00:32:51,786
Easy.

368
00:32:52,797 --> 00:32:55,823
You're killing me with these hugs.

369
00:32:55,934 --> 00:32:57,902
I have to go to work.

370
00:32:58,003 --> 00:32:59,971
- You have to?
- Yeah.

371
00:33:00,071 --> 00:33:01,470
You know I do, honey.

372
00:33:02,574 --> 00:33:05,805
But I'll try to come back early.

373
00:33:59,862 --> 00:34:02,592
- Hey, hey.
- Mark!

374
00:34:02,698 --> 00:34:04,359
How are you, lvan?

375
00:34:04,466 --> 00:34:05,933
Good, good.

376
00:34:06,034 --> 00:34:08,400
I was growing worried with all
this news of the fighting out there.

377
00:34:08,503 --> 00:34:09,060
Oh, yeah?

378
00:34:09,671 --> 00:34:10,865
What happened to you?

379
00:34:10,973 --> 00:34:14,568
Nothing. Got into a bind
and fell into a river is all.

380
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:17,501
You go to Kurdistan
to fall into a river?

381
00:34:17,613 --> 00:34:20,309
Yeah, well, no one ever said
I was smart.

382
00:34:20,415 --> 00:34:22,042
Listen, can you do
a rush job on these?

383
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:24,209
I wanna take advantage
of it being in the news, you know?

384
00:34:24,386 --> 00:34:25,978
How much of a rush?

385
00:34:26,088 --> 00:34:28,079
This afternoon?

386
00:34:29,424 --> 00:34:30,287
All right.

387
00:34:31,058 --> 00:34:32,992
I'll make you copies
to show on the wall, okay?

388
00:34:33,094 --> 00:34:34,459
Good man.

389
00:34:40,034 --> 00:34:41,058
You know it?

390
00:34:41,235 --> 00:34:43,567
Yeah, it's a great shot.

391
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:47,767
How long have you been doing
this now, the war stuff?

392
00:34:47,942 --> 00:34:49,910
- Eight, nine years?
- Twelve.

393
00:34:51,445 --> 00:34:53,640
You should get out.

394
00:34:53,748 --> 00:34:56,580
I can tell by looking at you
that it's time to get out.

395
00:34:56,683 --> 00:34:58,150
You know by looking at me?

396
00:34:58,318 --> 00:35:00,946
Well, I've been there, you know?

397
00:35:01,054 --> 00:35:03,716
And I know that, for all of us,
there comes the time to, well,

398
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:04,982
to leave it, you know?

399
00:35:05,091 --> 00:35:07,685
Yeah, well, that happens
out there, man.

400
00:35:07,794 --> 00:35:10,388
I deal with it out there.

401
00:35:10,563 --> 00:35:13,396
And then, I'm here.
Separate worlds.

402
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,831
You know, separate.

403
00:35:16,836 --> 00:35:18,133
Why, you don't believe me?

404
00:35:18,304 --> 00:35:19,566
No.

405
00:35:20,273 --> 00:35:21,968
It doesn't affect me, lvan.

406
00:35:22,142 --> 00:35:24,006
Look me in the eye and tell me that.

407
00:35:25,511 --> 00:35:26,808
It doesn't affect me.

408
00:35:26,979 --> 00:35:29,743
Well, that's the saddest thing
I've ever heard, son.

409
00:35:29,915 --> 00:35:31,610
Ivan, I just came in
to get the fucking films done.

410
00:35:31,717 --> 00:35:33,082
I didn't come in for a lecture, man.

411
00:35:33,252 --> 00:35:34,583
All right, all right.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

412
00:35:34,687 --> 00:35:35,654
It's none of my business, I know.

413
00:35:35,754 --> 00:35:37,153
I just think of you as a friend,
that's all.

414
00:35:37,256 --> 00:35:37,847
Fair enough.

415
00:35:38,023 --> 00:35:39,456
Okay, so, 5:00?

416
00:35:39,558 --> 00:35:41,617
Yeah. Bill me. Thanks.

417
00:35:41,727 --> 00:35:43,194
Okay.

418
00:35:52,103 --> 00:35:54,435
Give us a pint, Kevin, will ya?
Please.

419
00:36:13,791 --> 00:36:15,588
Cheers, Kevin.

420
00:37:57,991 --> 00:37:59,925
Hey. Stretching.

421
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:01,756
You've already started
going through them.

422
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:03,227
- Yeah.
- How are they?

423
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:05,388
- Good. Got some good ones.
- Show me.

424
00:38:05,898 --> 00:38:09,299
No, not now.
I'll show you later...

425
00:38:09,969 --> 00:38:11,800
Missy.

426
00:38:13,072 --> 00:38:15,666
Hey, I missed you today.

427
00:38:16,375 --> 00:38:18,969
I missed you, too.

428
00:38:26,385 --> 00:38:28,250
There you are.

429
00:39:14,965 --> 00:39:15,863
David!

430
00:39:22,439 --> 00:39:24,168
Elena?

431
00:39:31,648 --> 00:39:33,513
I'm sorry I'm late.

432
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:36,841
I had a starter.
I had to feed the beast.

433
00:39:37,887 --> 00:39:39,787
If I don't eat on time,
it gets really angry.

434
00:39:39,889 --> 00:39:42,289
It moved! Did you feel it?

435
00:39:42,792 --> 00:39:44,692
Of course you did.

436
00:39:46,896 --> 00:39:47,863
How are you?

437
00:39:48,031 --> 00:39:49,521
Yeah, all right.

438
00:39:49,632 --> 00:39:51,429
Except I have to pee
every five minutes.

439
00:39:51,601 --> 00:39:53,932
Any word from David, hmm?

440
00:39:55,437 --> 00:39:57,405
I know it's his job,

441
00:39:57,506 --> 00:39:59,531
and there's a war on,
and it's a primitive place,

442
00:39:59,641 --> 00:40:02,235
but surely he could get
a message out to me somehow.

443
00:40:02,411 --> 00:40:05,744
Or maybe not.
If the phone lines have been cut...

444
00:40:05,914 --> 00:40:08,439
Well, forget a message.
I want him.

445
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:11,849
He does this to me
and then fucks off to Kurdistan.

446
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:13,510
Yeah.

447
00:40:14,656 --> 00:40:19,683
Hey, what if I send a cable
to the Kurdish refugee camp?

448
00:40:19,794 --> 00:40:21,193
I know some people working there.

449
00:40:21,362 --> 00:40:23,922
I can have them
at least ask around, no?

450
00:40:24,098 --> 00:40:26,259
Oh, I don't know.

451
00:40:26,367 --> 00:40:28,562
The idea of some Red Cross guy
running up to him,

452
00:40:28,669 --> 00:40:31,502
telling him he has to call his wife,
he'd get pissed off.

453
00:40:31,605 --> 00:40:32,594
So what?

454
00:40:34,108 --> 00:40:36,406
You know what, you're right.

455
00:40:37,144 --> 00:40:40,443
Okay. Let's do it.

456
00:40:56,696 --> 00:40:58,459
Mark!

457
00:40:58,631 --> 00:41:00,622
- How are you?
- Good.

458
00:41:03,269 --> 00:41:04,759
You look like shite!

459
00:41:04,938 --> 00:41:06,098
Thanks.

460
00:41:06,206 --> 00:41:09,039
- What happened?
- Oh, you know.

461
00:41:09,743 --> 00:41:11,506
So, good trip?

462
00:41:11,678 --> 00:41:14,043
I think so, yeah. You tell me.

463
00:41:14,146 --> 00:41:14,840
Give!

464
00:41:15,381 --> 00:41:20,182
It's a Pesh Merga ambush
of an Iraqi convoy.

465
00:41:20,285 --> 00:41:24,187
They killed 19 troops
and took out a transportation truck.

466
00:41:24,289 --> 00:41:26,052
Yeah.

467
00:41:26,158 --> 00:41:28,820
Too bad Life magazine
only does pap these days,

468
00:41:28,927 --> 00:41:32,385
but I'll run these past them anyway.

469
00:41:32,498 --> 00:41:35,831
We should be able to find
something on the continent.

470
00:41:35,968 --> 00:41:37,868
Hear there's a lot of Kurds
in Germany, right?

471
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:38,868
Or do I mean Turks?

472
00:41:39,037 --> 00:41:41,369
You mean both, Amy.
Kurds and Turks.

473
00:41:41,539 --> 00:41:44,838
Yeah, okay. I'll try Stern.

474
00:41:45,009 --> 00:41:46,442
What else?

475
00:41:47,578 --> 00:41:48,806
"Triage."

476
00:41:48,913 --> 00:41:50,039
Working title.

477
00:41:50,148 --> 00:41:52,309
- For what?
- Um...

478
00:41:52,417 --> 00:41:54,681
Makeshift hospital in the field.

479
00:41:54,786 --> 00:41:56,947
Soldiers that came in
that were too gravely wounded,

480
00:41:57,055 --> 00:41:59,523
they took them outside
and killed them.

481
00:42:00,124 --> 00:42:01,386
Killed?

482
00:42:01,492 --> 00:42:02,220
By?

483
00:42:02,393 --> 00:42:05,021
Their own doctor.
Fellow Kurd.

484
00:42:06,296 --> 00:42:08,856
You can see him in the shots.

485
00:42:08,965 --> 00:42:10,398
Jesus Christ!

486
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,764
Mercy killings.

487
00:42:13,703 --> 00:42:20,108
Well, that is an incredible
piece of work, Mark.

488
00:42:20,277 --> 00:42:22,438
Could put these up for auction.

489
00:42:22,546 --> 00:42:23,979
I'll send it to all the news weeklies,

490
00:42:24,081 --> 00:42:26,777
and I'll tell them I need an answer
by tomorrow afternoon.

491
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:28,315
Nice.

492
00:42:28,418 --> 00:42:31,410
Listen, Time magazine
is sending a reporter to Burma,

493
00:42:31,588 --> 00:42:34,750
and they need a photographer.

494
00:42:34,924 --> 00:42:36,789
When they see these...

495
00:42:37,827 --> 00:42:38,919
Interested?

496
00:42:39,095 --> 00:42:40,357
Time? Yeah, sure.

497
00:42:41,097 --> 00:42:42,928
Well, don't jump for joy, will you?

498
00:42:43,032 --> 00:42:44,397
God.

499
00:42:45,167 --> 00:42:47,192
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm just tired.

500
00:42:47,303 --> 00:42:48,702
It's a long trip.

501
00:42:49,805 --> 00:42:52,137
- Okay, anything else?
- No, that's it.

502
00:42:52,308 --> 00:42:53,866
Okay, I'll call you. Bye!

503
00:42:53,976 --> 00:42:55,273
- See ya, Amy.
- See ya.

504
00:42:57,079 --> 00:42:59,774
That's a terrible limp you got there,
Mark. You sure you're okay?

505
00:42:59,881 --> 00:43:02,008
Yeah, fine. Just got banged up
a bit, you know.

506
00:43:02,117 --> 00:43:04,745
Don't start being all concerned, now.
It doesn't suit ya.

507
00:43:04,919 --> 00:43:05,886
Well, listen,

508
00:43:05,987 --> 00:43:09,388
you may have got banged up,
but I'd say it was worth it.

509
00:43:09,491 --> 00:43:12,551
- Great work.
- Thanks.

510
00:43:59,205 --> 00:44:01,765
Hey. I probably should have
stayed home.

511
00:44:01,874 --> 00:44:04,707
I'm not much in the mood
for socializing.

512
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:06,641
You should go and talk to Diane.

513
00:44:06,746 --> 00:44:08,839
I will. I will.

514
00:44:08,948 --> 00:44:10,711
I'm gonna say no
to the Burma job.

515
00:44:10,816 --> 00:44:12,215
Gonna have Amy
pull my name from...

516
00:44:12,385 --> 00:44:14,853
Are you serious?

517
00:44:14,954 --> 00:44:17,252
But you've always talked
about working for Time.

518
00:44:17,423 --> 00:44:18,913
I know. Just not right now.

519
00:44:19,025 --> 00:44:21,754
God knows there'll always be
another war.

520
00:44:23,528 --> 00:44:28,158
Mark, did something happen
in Kurdistan, hmm?

521
00:44:34,005 --> 00:44:35,973
Yes.

522
00:44:36,074 --> 00:44:38,474
I decided I want to spend
more time with you,

523
00:44:38,577 --> 00:44:40,169
and I want to have a baby with you.

524
00:44:43,748 --> 00:44:46,876
I'm sorry, but I'm...
I'm worried about you.

525
00:44:47,818 --> 00:44:49,217
- Worried about me?
- Yeah.

526
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:52,447
Yeah, something's wrong.
You're not yourself.

527
00:44:56,727 --> 00:44:58,661
I'm gonna see Diane.

528
00:46:40,894 --> 00:46:42,725
That's better.

529
00:46:42,829 --> 00:46:45,662
I don't know what I was thinking
with those heels.

530
00:46:45,765 --> 00:46:48,256
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

531
00:46:50,937 --> 00:46:54,566
It's just so weird.

532
00:46:54,674 --> 00:46:58,110
You know, Mark didn't
even mention David.

533
00:46:58,211 --> 00:47:00,805
It's so strange.

534
00:47:01,647 --> 00:47:02,944
I don't know.

535
00:47:03,048 --> 00:47:07,508
He just seems different,
preoccupied.

536
00:47:07,619 --> 00:47:10,417
And his limp is definitely
getting worse.

537
00:47:10,522 --> 00:47:13,389
He says it isn't, but...

538
00:47:14,026 --> 00:47:16,654
And tonight he told me
he wants to have a baby.

539
00:47:16,829 --> 00:47:18,524
- A baby?
- Yeah.

540
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:21,064
Mark wants to have a baby?

541
00:47:21,166 --> 00:47:24,101
Wow, he really isn't well.

542
00:47:27,239 --> 00:47:30,264
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Diane.

543
00:47:31,142 --> 00:47:33,201
My God.
You don't need to hear this.

544
00:47:34,178 --> 00:47:36,646
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

545
00:47:44,956 --> 00:47:47,083
Strange, isn't it?

546
00:47:48,926 --> 00:47:52,020
They've gone
to so many places together,

547
00:47:52,130 --> 00:47:55,656
they're best friends,
but they're so different.

548
00:47:55,832 --> 00:47:59,893
David seems to always focus
on the beauty, what's hopeful.

549
00:48:00,937 --> 00:48:03,030
While Mark...

550
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:07,474
Well, you wouldn't want
many of his pictures on the wall.

551
00:49:27,654 --> 00:49:29,212
Mark?

552
00:49:37,331 --> 00:49:39,162
Mark?

553
00:49:45,204 --> 00:49:45,932
Mark?!

554
00:50:11,630 --> 00:50:13,495
Mrs. Walsh?

555
00:50:14,466 --> 00:50:15,933
He's been sent on to neurology.

556
00:50:16,101 --> 00:50:19,468
We cleaned the head wound
and removed a foreign object.

557
00:50:19,638 --> 00:50:22,607
A foreign object?
What do you mean?

558
00:50:22,707 --> 00:50:24,868
I really couldn't say.
That's pathology.

559
00:50:25,043 --> 00:50:27,910
Hey, sorry.

560
00:50:28,013 --> 00:50:30,174
What is wrong with his legs?

561
00:50:30,282 --> 00:50:31,943
That's neurology, I'm afraid.

562
00:50:32,083 --> 00:50:34,984
But I'm sure the neurologist will be
able to answer all your questions.

563
00:50:35,086 --> 00:50:38,111
It should be only
a few more minutes.

564
00:50:38,222 --> 00:50:39,985
[Sighs]

565
00:50:48,832 --> 00:50:53,098
So, the good news is
there's nothing permanently wrong.

566
00:50:53,203 --> 00:50:55,433
Nothing physically,
permanently wrong with him,

567
00:50:55,539 --> 00:50:56,528
that is, you know.

568
00:50:56,640 --> 00:51:00,098
No neural disruption,
no broken bones.

569
00:51:00,210 --> 00:51:01,234
There is some swelling

570
00:51:01,345 --> 00:51:03,403
and some hypersensitivity
along the spine.

571
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:05,514
That's a class symptom
of high-impact trauma,

572
00:51:05,615 --> 00:51:09,915
but all indications are
that it's dissipating.

573
00:51:10,019 --> 00:51:12,044
Then, why is he getting worse?

574
00:51:12,155 --> 00:51:13,782
He told me he fell into a river,

575
00:51:13,890 --> 00:51:15,585
that he was dragged
across some rocks.

576
00:51:15,758 --> 00:51:17,919
- Is that what he told you?
- Yes.

577
00:51:18,094 --> 00:51:20,153
That's when I started to wonder
about his story.

578
00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:23,993
Because we extracted this
from the back of his head.

579
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:26,898
Um, "composition...
steel and cadmium alloy

580
00:51:27,003 --> 00:51:28,197
with traces of TNT.

581
00:51:28,371 --> 00:51:29,837
Characteristics...
an eighth of an inch thick,

582
00:51:29,938 --> 00:51:31,701
jagged edges,
curled on two sides,

583
00:51:31,807 --> 00:51:34,935
indicating a sudden
and extreme metal-stress."

584
00:51:39,915 --> 00:51:41,075
Shrapnel.

585
00:51:41,783 --> 00:51:45,275
It seems like Mark had
a very close call over there.

586
00:51:45,454 --> 00:51:46,785
An artillery shell exploded

587
00:51:46,955 --> 00:51:49,719
just meters
from where he was standing.

588
00:51:49,825 --> 00:51:51,349
That's how he got this.

589
00:51:51,526 --> 00:51:52,754
But, look, that's not the problem.

590
00:51:52,861 --> 00:51:54,886
By all medical
and physical indicators,

591
00:51:54,997 --> 00:51:56,520
he should be improving.

592
00:51:56,631 --> 00:52:00,431
But he's not. I mean, if anything,
he's getting worse.

593
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:01,694
Which means?

594
00:52:01,869 --> 00:52:04,269
Which means it's
a psychosomatic complication,

595
00:52:04,372 --> 00:52:05,737
maybe PTSD.

596
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:07,569
Look, I'm not a psychiatrist,

597
00:52:07,742 --> 00:52:11,576
but I think that might be
the kind of doctor he needs.

598
00:52:13,781 --> 00:52:16,875
Why didn't you tell me
about the explosion?

599
00:52:21,622 --> 00:52:24,351
I thought it would be easier not to.

600
00:52:26,526 --> 00:52:28,323
Easier?

601
00:52:28,428 --> 00:52:30,191
Yeah.

602
00:52:30,296 --> 00:52:32,662
Love, you've already had enough
to worry about.

603
00:52:32,766 --> 00:52:35,132
When I go away, you know?

604
00:52:46,279 --> 00:52:48,611
It's over now.

605
00:52:48,715 --> 00:52:50,648
You're home.

606
00:52:51,617 --> 00:52:53,448
I love you.

607
00:52:55,454 --> 00:52:58,082
Don't be upset at me, Elena.

608
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:02,527
I'll be fine.

609
00:53:05,964 --> 00:53:09,092
- Everything is going to be okay.
- Yeah.

610
00:53:09,201 --> 00:53:11,066
I'm sure.

611
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:15,192
[In Spanish]... Joaquin Morales.
Leave a message after the beep.

612
00:54:15,297 --> 00:54:16,059
[Beep]

613
00:54:16,365 --> 00:54:19,163
[In Spanish]
Grandfather, are you there?

614
00:54:20,736 --> 00:54:23,136
[In Spanish]
It's me, Elena.

615
00:54:25,841 --> 00:54:27,968
Mutilated baby corpse.

616
00:54:28,677 --> 00:54:30,668
Am I right?

617
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:34,307
In this test, there is
no right or wrong.

618
00:54:35,217 --> 00:54:36,582
Next one.

619
00:54:36,685 --> 00:54:38,948
Oh, Jesus.

620
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:41,680
Mutilated woman's corpse.

621
00:54:48,997 --> 00:54:51,966
Mutilated man's corpse.
Must be the father.

622
00:54:52,066 --> 00:54:54,933
They got the whole family,
did they, doctor? Fucking hell.

623
00:54:56,037 --> 00:54:58,130
All just a game to you, Mr. Walsh?

624
00:54:58,306 --> 00:55:01,070
I don't know.
It just all seems a bit...

625
00:55:02,010 --> 00:55:03,841
...stupid, you know?

626
00:55:04,012 --> 00:55:06,002
Maybe it is.

627
00:55:06,113 --> 00:55:08,172
But I am trying to help you,

628
00:55:08,282 --> 00:55:11,479
and in 15 minutes,
I'll be leaving here and will get paid

629
00:55:11,585 --> 00:55:13,610
whether you answer
my questions or not,

630
00:55:13,787 --> 00:55:15,948
while you'll still be lying here
unable to walk.

631
00:55:16,056 --> 00:55:17,250
The point being, I suppose,

632
00:55:17,357 --> 00:55:20,815
that stupidity can take
a variety of forms.

633
00:55:22,029 --> 00:55:24,964
Have you ever been
in a war zone, doctor?

634
00:55:25,632 --> 00:55:29,193
No. But I've treated patients
who have.

635
00:55:29,369 --> 00:55:31,996
All right. Well, no offense,
but I don't think it's the same thing.

636
00:55:32,104 --> 00:55:35,835
No, it's not the same thing.

637
00:55:36,776 --> 00:55:38,801
But does that mean
we can only understand

638
00:55:38,911 --> 00:55:41,709
what we directly experience?

639
00:55:42,648 --> 00:55:46,345
Can only someone who's been raped
counsel a rape victim?

640
00:55:48,454 --> 00:55:50,251
Maybe.

641
00:56:03,802 --> 00:56:07,329
I didn't know
Mark had been published.

642
00:56:16,715 --> 00:56:18,478
Do you think you can help him?

643
00:56:18,650 --> 00:56:21,983
Yes, of course I can help him.
I can help anyone.

644
00:56:22,587 --> 00:56:26,352
Like I said last night, it doesn't
change anything between us.

645
00:56:26,457 --> 00:56:29,426
I only asked you here to help him.

646
00:56:31,795 --> 00:56:36,391
How did you become so hard, Elena?

647
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:38,934
So judgmental?

648
00:56:41,038 --> 00:56:44,235
Is it always wrong
to be judgmental?

649
00:56:44,909 --> 00:56:49,369
About the Nazis
or what Stalin did?

650
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:51,175
About what you did?

651
00:56:51,848 --> 00:56:56,842
Oh? And just what is it
that you think that I did?

652
00:56:57,020 --> 00:56:58,612
No, no. I'm... I'm sorry.

653
00:56:58,721 --> 00:57:01,212
No, I do want to go into this.

654
00:57:01,324 --> 00:57:05,624
This is something you have
always denied me.

655
00:57:05,728 --> 00:57:08,128
You have learned about what I did,

656
00:57:08,231 --> 00:57:11,530
and that was enough,
you made up your own mind.

657
00:57:11,634 --> 00:57:17,800
But you never once
came to ask me.

658
00:57:19,141 --> 00:57:22,941
You are the only thing
in the world for me, Elena.

659
00:57:23,045 --> 00:57:27,778
So, tell me, what it is
that you think I did there?

660
00:57:29,418 --> 00:57:32,387
Your patients were war criminals.

661
00:57:32,554 --> 00:57:34,920
Monsters.

662
00:57:35,090 --> 00:57:38,150
Men who destroyed villages
and tortured people to death,

663
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:40,455
all in the name of Spain, of Franco.

664
00:57:41,430 --> 00:57:46,594
And when they came to you,
you absolved them of all guilt.

665
00:57:46,767 --> 00:57:49,736
You purified them.

666
00:57:50,671 --> 00:57:53,868
Yeah, you came up
with that phrase, didn't you?

667
00:57:53,975 --> 00:57:56,205
You must have.

668
00:57:56,310 --> 00:58:02,579
"The Morales Institute
for Psychological Purification."

669
00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:05,344
Thousands of innocent people
murdered,

670
00:58:05,453 --> 00:58:08,013
and whenever their killers
felt pangs of guilt,

671
00:58:08,122 --> 00:58:10,090
they went to you,
and you told them,

672
00:58:10,257 --> 00:58:12,884
"Don't worry about it,
you had no choice.

673
00:58:12,993 --> 00:58:14,688
Get on with your life."

674
00:58:14,794 --> 00:58:16,921
Those men,
when they were brought to me,

675
00:58:17,030 --> 00:58:20,898
those "monsters" as you call them,
they were lost.

676
00:58:21,001 --> 00:58:22,901
So as a last hope,

677
00:58:23,003 --> 00:58:25,938
they brought them to me,
and yes, I purified them.

678
00:58:26,039 --> 00:58:27,939
To you, it is simple.

679
00:58:28,041 --> 00:58:29,406
They were evil men,

680
00:58:29,509 --> 00:58:33,639
and because I treated them,
I am evil, too. Hmm?

681
00:58:35,648 --> 00:58:38,674
But you forget something.

682
00:58:38,785 --> 00:58:42,777
These were the men who had won.

683
00:58:45,758 --> 00:58:49,717
They held the fate of Spain
in their hands,

684
00:58:49,828 --> 00:58:51,887
and they had tasted power.

685
00:58:53,432 --> 00:58:57,562
And what is the greatest power
that a man can have?

686
00:58:59,204 --> 00:59:01,934
It is to kill.

687
00:59:02,041 --> 00:59:06,443
And if you have killed a thousand,
what are a thousand more?

688
00:59:06,577 --> 00:59:10,741
If you have tortured one person,
is it too hard to torture another?

689
00:59:10,848 --> 00:59:11,872
No.

690
00:59:11,983 --> 00:59:15,783
It's easy. It's the easiest thing
in the world.

691
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:19,083
This is what our country
was faced with.

692
00:59:19,190 --> 00:59:22,125
So what was I to do?

693
00:59:22,226 --> 00:59:24,990
Was I to leave these killers
as they were

694
00:59:25,096 --> 00:59:26,723
so they could go on killing?

695
00:59:26,831 --> 00:59:29,664
No, I could not agree to that.

696
00:59:29,767 --> 00:59:34,135
So, I purified them.

697
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:38,970
I brought them back to life,

698
00:59:39,076 --> 00:59:43,012
and to humanity.

699
00:59:44,014 --> 00:59:48,110
How many people did I save?

700
00:59:48,218 --> 00:59:50,015
I think I saved many.

701
00:59:51,221 --> 00:59:55,715
So there you have it.
Do with it what you will.

702
00:59:55,826 --> 01:00:00,194
But you are no longer a teenager.

703
01:00:00,296 --> 01:00:03,788
The world is a very complex place.

704
01:00:03,899 --> 01:00:06,527
There is very little of it
that is black and white.

705
01:00:42,137 --> 01:00:44,662
Ah, so you're awake then.

706
01:00:44,772 --> 01:00:46,262
How do you feel?

707
01:00:47,175 --> 01:00:49,006
I'm fine.

708
01:00:49,110 --> 01:00:50,702
Marvelous.

709
01:00:50,812 --> 01:00:51,904
What time is it?

710
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:53,944
Time to get started.

711
01:00:54,047 --> 01:00:55,537
Beyond that, who can say?

712
01:00:56,483 --> 01:00:58,314
Elena yesterday telephoned me

713
01:00:58,418 --> 01:01:00,147
and told me
about all your difficulties

714
01:01:00,254 --> 01:01:01,448
and asked if I could help.

715
01:01:01,622 --> 01:01:04,318
I said, "Well."
I was rather hesitant at first,

716
01:01:04,424 --> 01:01:07,450
because I've been retired
from the field for many years, but...

717
01:01:07,628 --> 01:01:09,858
Sorry, but you mentioned Elena?

718
01:01:10,030 --> 01:01:14,399
I am Joaquin Morales,
Elena's grandfather.

719
01:01:14,568 --> 01:01:16,729
Carmen, her mother,

720
01:01:16,837 --> 01:01:20,397
is always telling me
about your adventures.

721
01:01:20,506 --> 01:01:22,303
And now we finally meet,

722
01:01:22,408 --> 01:01:28,938
and, uh, it's a pity
it's in these... circumstances.

723
01:01:29,048 --> 01:01:31,778
I imagine you've heard
a great deal about me.

724
01:01:31,951 --> 01:01:34,317
Well, she said she stopped
talking to you a number of years ago

725
01:01:34,420 --> 01:01:35,978
because she heard
you were a fascist.

726
01:01:36,155 --> 01:01:37,520
A fascist!

727
01:01:37,623 --> 01:01:39,352
[Laughs]

728
01:01:39,458 --> 01:01:42,120
She's a very inventive girl.

729
01:01:42,295 --> 01:01:47,596
Por Dios, all this talk is just
torturing me from reason I came.

730
01:01:47,699 --> 01:01:52,102
I would like to make
a brief patient history of you,

731
01:01:52,204 --> 01:01:54,798
if that's all right with you.

732
01:01:56,408 --> 01:01:58,205
Sure, I've no choice.

733
01:01:58,310 --> 01:02:00,642
- Age?
- 34.

734
01:02:00,812 --> 01:02:03,007
Parents still alive?

735
01:02:03,114 --> 01:02:04,046
[Yawning]

736
01:02:04,149 --> 01:02:07,641
Father passed away
and mother lives in London.

737
01:02:07,752 --> 01:02:09,811
- Brothers and sisters?
- Nope.

738
01:02:09,921 --> 01:02:10,853
Hmm.

739
01:02:11,756 --> 01:02:14,747
Well, then, let's get started.

740
01:02:14,925 --> 01:02:17,155
- That's it?
- I beg your pardon?

741
01:02:17,261 --> 01:02:19,422
I thought psychiatrists
were supposed to ask you

742
01:02:19,530 --> 01:02:21,964
all sorts of questions
about your childhood experiences

743
01:02:22,066 --> 01:02:24,000
and relationships and all that stuff.

744
01:02:24,101 --> 01:02:26,569
Unnecessary. Exotic.

745
01:02:27,605 --> 01:02:29,869
You're not actually a psychiatrist,
are you?

746
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:33,476
Well, I like to think of myself
as a...

747
01:02:33,577 --> 01:02:36,239
a scholar of the human spirit.

748
01:02:36,413 --> 01:02:38,847
Ah, that's lovely.

749
01:02:39,016 --> 01:02:40,880
Tell me a war story.

750
01:02:41,050 --> 01:02:43,382
- What?
- A war story.

751
01:02:43,553 --> 01:02:44,747
You must have many,

752
01:02:44,854 --> 01:02:46,788
but the first one
that comes to your mind.

753
01:02:46,956 --> 01:02:50,687
It's a bit early
in the fucking day for that.

754
01:02:54,764 --> 01:02:56,789
You're serious.

755
01:03:47,248 --> 01:03:50,945
I don't even know
if his family got the body back.

756
01:03:51,619 --> 01:03:54,952
Why do you think
this incident affected you?

757
01:03:55,122 --> 01:03:57,522
I dunno.

758
01:03:57,625 --> 01:03:59,559
Maybe I felt responsible.

759
01:03:59,660 --> 01:04:04,892
Well, perhaps if you hadn't
been there, he wouldn't have run.

760
01:04:05,065 --> 01:04:09,661
The soldiers
would not have fired, hmm?

761
01:04:11,037 --> 01:04:12,732
I suppose so.

762
01:04:12,839 --> 01:04:14,568
Well, that makes perfect sense.

763
01:04:14,741 --> 01:04:19,440
You feel that you're responsible
because to a great degree you are.

764
01:04:20,747 --> 01:04:23,841
You think I'm too harsh?

765
01:04:24,017 --> 01:04:26,178
How many people
have you told this story to, Mark?

766
01:04:26,286 --> 01:04:28,719
Four? Three? Two? Twenty?

767
01:04:29,722 --> 01:04:32,657
And what do they say?
"Oh, you mustn't blame yourself."

768
01:04:32,825 --> 01:04:35,350
"Oh, no, it was not your fault."

769
01:04:35,461 --> 01:04:38,794
"Oh, no, there was nothing
you could do." Am I correct?

770
01:04:39,665 --> 01:04:42,133
You have looked to others
for forgiveness,

771
01:04:42,234 --> 01:04:43,792
but, as you have discovered,

772
01:04:43,902 --> 01:04:46,234
this is something
they cannot give you.

773
01:04:46,338 --> 01:04:49,307
We cannot let go of the pain.
We have to carry it with us forever.

774
01:04:49,475 --> 01:04:53,468
That is what it means to live.

775
01:04:53,579 --> 01:04:58,277
Now, I can help you
to live with this pain.

776
01:04:58,383 --> 01:04:59,372
Look at me.

777
01:05:01,486 --> 01:05:04,478
I am 86 years old.

778
01:05:04,589 --> 01:05:07,524
I lost my entire family.

779
01:05:07,625 --> 01:05:10,025
I lost my parents,

780
01:05:10,128 --> 01:05:15,225
I lost my brothers and sisters,
and I lost my wife.

781
01:05:15,333 --> 01:05:18,825
And yet, I am still here.

782
01:05:18,936 --> 01:05:20,836
I can still smile,

783
01:05:20,938 --> 01:05:25,135
and the world is still...
a wonderful place.

784
01:05:30,981 --> 01:05:34,576
Elena will probably be here
before long.

785
01:05:34,684 --> 01:05:37,915
So you tell her I'm in the hotel.

786
01:05:41,725 --> 01:05:45,718
Oh, by the way, you know
you sleep very peacefully.

787
01:05:46,363 --> 01:05:49,456
There's not a movement,
not a wrinkle in your face.

788
01:05:49,565 --> 01:05:50,691
Just like a baby.

789
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:53,027
That's a good thing, isn't it?

790
01:05:53,702 --> 01:05:54,930
No.

791
01:05:55,037 --> 01:05:58,302
If you were thrashing about
and muttering to yourself,

792
01:05:58,407 --> 01:06:01,570
it would mean the problem
is close by.

793
01:06:01,677 --> 01:06:03,372
But peacefulness?

794
01:06:03,479 --> 01:06:05,947
In a grown man,
that is not a good sign.

795
01:06:29,771 --> 01:06:31,568
Thank you.

796
01:06:32,607 --> 01:06:36,065
- I'll see you at home.
- Sure.

797
01:06:51,358 --> 01:06:54,191
12... 13...

798
01:06:54,294 --> 01:06:56,626
14... 15...

799
01:06:56,730 --> 01:06:59,198
16... 17...

800
01:06:59,299 --> 01:07:01,995
Excellent.
You're almost back to normal.

801
01:07:02,102 --> 01:07:04,434
I'm not. I'm moving
with less grace than you.

802
01:07:04,538 --> 01:07:05,800
[Laughs]

803
01:07:05,906 --> 01:07:06,895
Splendid.

804
01:07:07,508 --> 01:07:11,273
A sense of humor is always
one of the last abilities to return.

805
01:07:11,377 --> 01:07:12,503
That was the office.

806
01:07:14,046 --> 01:07:16,412
A Red Cross team in Kurdistan
just found David's things

807
01:07:16,516 --> 01:07:19,849
in a hotel room in Rawa...

808
01:07:20,019 --> 01:07:21,714
Rawanduz.

809
01:07:21,821 --> 01:07:23,152
Yeah.

810
01:07:23,856 --> 01:07:25,949
It's a town in the north.

811
01:07:26,058 --> 01:07:28,117
- It was our base.
- In the north?

812
01:07:28,227 --> 01:07:29,854
But I thought you told me
he went south.

813
01:07:30,530 --> 01:07:32,589
I don't know. He was...

814
01:07:32,698 --> 01:07:36,497
He was heading south, and I was
supposed to go back to Rawanduz,

815
01:07:36,601 --> 01:07:40,128
but I just headed straight for Turkey
when I had a chance, you know?

816
01:07:40,305 --> 01:07:43,240
Everything's still there.
His clothes, everything.

817
01:07:45,043 --> 01:07:47,477
Okay. What do we do?

818
01:07:47,579 --> 01:07:49,240
Is there anyone there
we can contact?

819
01:07:49,414 --> 01:07:50,381
I don't know.

820
01:07:50,482 --> 01:07:52,109
Think, Mark!
There must be someone!

821
01:07:52,217 --> 01:07:52,979
I don't know!

822
01:07:53,151 --> 01:07:56,052
This is not very helpful.
Not right now.

823
01:07:57,689 --> 01:08:00,590
What am I supposed
to tell Diane, huh?

824
01:08:00,692 --> 01:08:02,921
My God, what do I tell her?

825
01:08:04,695 --> 01:08:07,095
I have to get over there.
Call me if you think of anything.

826
01:08:14,505 --> 01:08:16,336
I'm afraid I don't...

827
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:17,930
I don't understand.

828
01:08:20,377 --> 01:08:22,208
My best friend, David.

829
01:08:22,313 --> 01:08:26,147
We went to Kurdistan together,
but we split up.

830
01:08:29,053 --> 01:08:30,815
He should have been back
a week ago.

831
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:33,013
And you're worried?

832
01:08:34,958 --> 01:08:37,426
A little bit, yeah.

833
01:08:37,594 --> 01:08:41,291
His wife is expecting a baby
any day.

834
01:08:41,397 --> 01:08:44,696
You know. But he's careful.

835
01:08:44,801 --> 01:08:48,237
It's not the first time one of us
has been late back.

836
01:08:50,073 --> 01:08:53,702
Hmm. And it's a war zone, of course.

837
01:08:53,810 --> 01:08:58,371
There are often many delays.

838
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:01,381
But I don't think you should worry
about him. He'll be fine.

839
01:09:02,618 --> 01:09:06,452
And the most important thing is
to concentrate on your treatment.

840
01:09:07,556 --> 01:09:10,024
Which reminds me.

841
01:09:11,026 --> 01:09:16,589
I know very little
about the geography of Kurdistan.

842
01:09:16,698 --> 01:09:21,658
It was partitioned
by the English, wasn't it?

843
01:09:21,770 --> 01:09:25,034
Yeah. Any time you find a mess
in the world,

844
01:09:25,139 --> 01:09:26,766
it's usually thanks to them
or the French.

845
01:09:27,975 --> 01:09:33,208
Well, perhaps you could
draw a map for me?

846
01:09:36,117 --> 01:09:37,641
What, on the wall?

847
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:39,752
Why not?

848
01:09:39,854 --> 01:09:42,982
You think it will clash
with the decor?

849
01:09:43,090 --> 01:09:46,218
Just a rough map.

850
01:09:48,963 --> 01:09:50,793
Jesus.

851
01:10:00,774 --> 01:10:02,765
And while you're doing it,

852
01:10:02,876 --> 01:10:05,845
perhaps another one
of your war stories.

853
01:11:06,504 --> 01:11:09,268
Sorry, I don't understand you.

854
01:12:51,471 --> 01:12:53,735
You know, the odds alone
would say that

855
01:12:53,841 --> 01:12:57,971
not even one of those skulls
belonged to a member of her family.

856
01:12:58,078 --> 01:13:00,238
So, in effect, I'd...

857
01:13:00,346 --> 01:13:03,782
...given her a bunch of strangers
to take home with her, you know?

858
01:13:03,950 --> 01:13:08,353
You are wrong about one thing.

859
01:13:08,454 --> 01:13:11,446
She knew well
that you were pretending.

860
01:13:11,624 --> 01:13:13,888
That is why she was grateful.

861
01:13:13,993 --> 01:13:17,190
That is why she thanked you.
For the charade.

862
01:13:17,296 --> 01:13:21,130
For the performance you put on
for her benefit.

863
01:13:21,234 --> 01:13:25,670
It's very complicated
being a survivor, you know?

864
01:13:25,837 --> 01:13:31,605
Sometimes you have to place
your faith in magic,

865
01:13:31,710 --> 01:13:36,670
or believe in things that you know
are not true if you want to continue.

866
01:13:36,781 --> 01:13:39,181
It's a kind of an instinct.

867
01:13:39,384 --> 01:13:43,252
If you wish to continue,
if you wish to survive,

868
01:13:43,355 --> 01:13:47,951
then you must bury the dead.

869
01:13:51,129 --> 01:13:56,156
Tell me, does the camera act
as a kind of filter for you,

870
01:13:56,267 --> 01:13:58,599
to distance you
from your surroundings?

871
01:13:58,702 --> 01:14:02,365
Sure. I suppose that's why a lot
of photographers have been killed

872
01:14:02,473 --> 01:14:04,338
throughout the years.

873
01:14:04,441 --> 01:14:06,033
Looking through the camera,
it's easy to forget

874
01:14:06,143 --> 01:14:07,804
that the things that are happening
in front of you

875
01:14:07,912 --> 01:14:09,277
are actually real, you know?

876
01:14:09,380 --> 01:14:12,645
Or sometimes it fails, huh?

877
01:14:12,750 --> 01:14:15,583
Sometimes the real world
takes over,

878
01:14:15,686 --> 01:14:19,712
and then, when there's no one
to help you, you're very lonely.

879
01:14:20,290 --> 01:14:22,622
Perhaps that is a reason
why you travel

880
01:14:22,725 --> 01:14:24,852
with all the other photographers, no?

881
01:14:24,961 --> 01:14:26,690
Suppose so.

882
01:14:26,863 --> 01:14:28,387
And to protect each other?

883
01:14:29,299 --> 01:14:30,857
Yeah, that, too.

884
01:14:31,301 --> 01:14:33,064
One more observation.

885
01:14:38,274 --> 01:14:41,710
I wouldn't call it an obsession,

886
01:14:41,878 --> 01:14:45,370
but why are you so concerned
about what happens to the dead?

887
01:14:46,448 --> 01:14:50,214
I noticed this when you were
talking about the boy from Beirut.

888
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:52,287
At the end, you said,

889
01:14:52,387 --> 01:14:58,053
"I don't even know if his family
ever got his body back."

890
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:03,996
What is so important to you
about the fate of the dead?

891
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:07,834
Maybe superstition.

892
01:15:07,936 --> 01:15:09,733
Superstition?

893
01:15:09,838 --> 01:15:14,069
Yeah. You know, that the dead
should be returned to their families.

894
01:15:14,175 --> 01:15:16,143
That they shouldn't be left alone.

895
01:15:16,243 --> 01:15:19,076
More important to you
than those who survive?

896
01:15:19,246 --> 01:15:20,907
No.

897
01:15:22,016 --> 01:15:24,610
No, I don't know.

898
01:15:25,820 --> 01:15:28,721
Actually, I don't know what
you're trying to get at, Joaquin.

899
01:15:28,823 --> 01:15:30,313
I think you do.

900
01:15:30,491 --> 01:15:31,924
I said, I don't.

901
01:15:32,093 --> 01:15:34,027
What do you feel
when you see all these bodies

902
01:15:34,128 --> 01:15:36,028
lying around everywhere?

903
01:15:36,130 --> 01:15:37,859
Sorrow? Fear?

904
01:15:37,965 --> 01:15:41,661
Relief that you
are not amongst them,

905
01:15:41,768 --> 01:15:43,565
that you have survived?

906
01:15:43,670 --> 01:15:44,967
Fuck you.

907
01:15:45,071 --> 01:15:47,301
- Excuse me?
- I said, fuck you!

908
01:15:48,641 --> 01:15:50,666
I'm not one of your fucking
war criminals, all right?

909
01:15:50,777 --> 01:15:51,766
So just back off!

910
01:15:51,945 --> 01:15:53,173
You said you wanted to talk to me.

911
01:15:53,346 --> 01:15:55,143
I never fuckin' asked you
to come here!

912
01:15:56,049 --> 01:15:58,483
I was asleep, my hospital room,

913
01:15:58,585 --> 01:16:00,416
you walked in
and fucking woke me!

914
01:16:01,187 --> 01:16:02,984
Well, we can stop if you prefer.

915
01:16:03,156 --> 01:16:05,215
- Yeah, I need some sleep.
- Well, I'll take you home.

916
01:16:05,325 --> 01:16:07,053
No, you're grand.
Stay where you are.

917
01:17:05,549 --> 01:17:08,575
Ah, so you're awake.

918
01:17:09,019 --> 01:17:11,783
- What time is it?
- Up you get. Up.

919
01:17:11,955 --> 01:17:13,252
I need coffee first.

920
01:17:13,423 --> 01:17:17,860
Oh, I'll get the coffee.
You just start the exercises.

921
01:17:34,110 --> 01:17:36,408
Great, I'm cured.

922
01:17:36,512 --> 01:17:39,106
You should take a look
at the front page of the newspaper.

923
01:17:39,215 --> 01:17:42,184
I think it will be of interest to you.

924
01:17:45,588 --> 01:17:47,749
Jesus Christ.

925
01:17:48,457 --> 01:17:50,948
That fucking animal.

926
01:17:52,261 --> 01:17:55,855
A little strong, perhaps,
for your Celtic taste,

927
01:17:55,964 --> 01:17:59,798
but I think it will do you
a lot of good.

928
01:18:00,602 --> 01:18:03,264
The French call our way
of making coffee

929
01:18:03,371 --> 01:18:06,534
le jus des chaussettes,
which means...

930
01:18:06,641 --> 01:18:09,041
"Socks juice," I know.

931
01:18:09,144 --> 01:18:13,342
Jesus, you have a fucking answer
for everything, don't you?

932
01:18:13,448 --> 01:18:15,143
Thank you.

933
01:18:15,884 --> 01:18:19,820
The fellow that got this picture
probably stands to make a fortune.

934
01:18:20,420 --> 01:18:23,981
We would have been there a month,
he might have come in yesterday.

935
01:18:24,091 --> 01:18:25,558
But he was there
when this happened.

936
01:18:26,093 --> 01:18:28,584
- We had no idea we'd be this right.
- We?

937
01:18:29,663 --> 01:18:34,225
You mean you
and your friend, David?

938
01:18:35,536 --> 01:18:36,594
Yeah.

939
01:18:36,703 --> 01:18:37,567
Mm-hmm.

940
01:18:39,373 --> 01:18:44,401
I wonder if you would, perhaps,
do another little drawing for me.

941
01:18:44,511 --> 01:18:50,073
Another map of the area
where the accident took place.

942
01:18:50,183 --> 01:18:53,619
Not in minute detail, of course,

943
01:18:53,719 --> 01:18:58,656
but just the location
of the hill and the river, hmm?

944
01:18:59,659 --> 01:19:01,388
Come on, up! Up!

945
01:19:11,170 --> 01:19:13,035
All right.

946
01:19:18,510 --> 01:19:20,307
Let me see.

947
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:25,043
Well...

948
01:19:25,450 --> 01:19:27,008
This is the hill.

949
01:19:27,185 --> 01:19:29,312
This is the river.

950
01:19:32,757 --> 01:19:35,726
This is where the explosion...

951
01:19:35,860 --> 01:19:37,725
...happened.

952
01:19:37,829 --> 01:19:39,057
And...

953
01:19:39,164 --> 01:19:42,599
somewhere here is
where I fell into the river,

954
01:19:42,700 --> 01:19:46,431
and somewhere down here
is where they found me.

955
01:19:46,537 --> 01:19:48,471
The Harir Cave
is somewhere over there.

956
01:19:48,639 --> 01:19:49,799
What of David?

957
01:19:52,042 --> 01:19:56,001
Where was he standing
when the explosion occurred?

958
01:20:03,087 --> 01:20:05,954
I've always known, Mark.

959
01:20:06,056 --> 01:20:09,149
I've always known since
the first time I heard his name

960
01:20:09,259 --> 01:20:10,726
and saw your face.

961
01:20:11,561 --> 01:20:15,361
And now you have to...
tell your story.

962
01:20:16,899 --> 01:20:19,094
It's not easy, I know.

963
01:20:19,202 --> 01:20:20,464
What I'm trying to say to you

964
01:20:20,570 --> 01:20:25,166
is that you are not as tough
as you think you are,

965
01:20:25,275 --> 01:20:29,109
and you cannot
carry this on forever.

966
01:20:30,747 --> 01:20:36,685
You must come back
to the people who love you.

967
01:20:40,155 --> 01:20:43,682
- David!
- Mister Walsh, are you coming?!

968
01:20:54,269 --> 01:20:57,261
Hey, we're not going
to make it this trip.

969
01:20:57,372 --> 01:21:00,864
All right. Listen, good luck.
Godspeed to ya.

970
01:21:13,688 --> 01:21:15,246
How much further do you think?

971
01:21:15,423 --> 01:21:18,824
Fucked if I know.
This is your bright idea, man.

972
01:21:18,959 --> 01:21:20,551
Tell me you're still
not angry at me?

973
01:21:20,661 --> 01:21:23,824
Nah. Nah, you're right.
It's time to get home.

974
01:21:23,931 --> 01:21:26,593
Jesus, it's beautiful, man.

975
01:21:49,889 --> 01:21:51,481
You know what?

976
01:22:20,319 --> 01:22:21,183
David!

977
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:23,419
David!

978
01:22:23,521 --> 01:22:24,749
David!

979
01:22:24,922 --> 01:22:26,014
Don't shoot!

980
01:22:26,190 --> 01:22:27,452
David!

981
01:22:27,992 --> 01:22:31,428
Hey! Hey! Hey!

982
01:22:31,596 --> 01:22:32,392
Hey!

983
01:22:33,331 --> 01:22:35,196
Hey!

984
01:22:35,333 --> 01:22:36,493
David!

985
01:22:48,413 --> 01:22:52,348
No! I'm gonna fucking die!

986
01:23:13,403 --> 01:23:14,335
Mark!

987
01:23:14,504 --> 01:23:17,597
Mark! I'm gonna die!

988
01:23:17,773 --> 01:23:20,401
I'm gonna die!

989
01:23:21,811 --> 01:23:25,144
Mark, I'm gonna die!
I'm gonna die!

990
01:23:25,314 --> 01:23:26,906
Take me home!

991
01:24:09,123 --> 01:24:11,317
Mark, the chair.
Get us the chair.

992
01:24:11,425 --> 01:24:13,416
Take me to the hospital!

993
01:24:13,594 --> 01:24:14,583
Don't worry.

994
01:24:19,199 --> 01:24:19,927
Be calm.

995
01:24:27,708 --> 01:24:29,266
Vamos.

996
01:25:04,676 --> 01:25:06,541
Look at her.

997
01:25:14,352 --> 01:25:16,547
Would you like to hold her?

998
01:25:34,872 --> 01:25:36,897
I'm so sorry.

999
01:25:37,641 --> 01:25:39,131
Diane, I loved him so much.

1000
01:25:44,848 --> 01:25:46,338
I know. He loved you, too.

1001
01:25:49,119 --> 01:25:51,485
I wanted to tell you.

1002
01:25:53,657 --> 01:25:56,148
I just didn't know how.

1003
01:25:58,928 --> 01:26:00,657
Where did you bury him?

1004
01:26:44,439 --> 01:26:48,432
Hey, where is Mark?

1005
01:26:48,610 --> 01:26:51,601
I don't know.
He left a few minutes ago.

1006
01:26:58,686 --> 01:26:59,948
Elena.

1007
01:27:02,323 --> 01:27:04,518
Be nice to him.

1008
01:27:05,993 --> 01:27:10,521
We don't know what it's like to go
to those places and come back.

1009
01:27:11,832 --> 01:27:18,634
And anyway, be nice to him,
because he is back.

1010
01:28:07,419 --> 01:28:10,286
I wanted to take him home.

1011
01:28:10,389 --> 01:28:12,481
I really did.

1012
01:28:13,624 --> 01:28:16,491
I kept saying...

1013
01:28:20,465 --> 01:28:26,199
"Don't worry, I'm taking you with me.
I'm taking you home."

1014
01:28:34,245 --> 01:28:36,179
I'm taking you home.

1015
01:28:37,515 --> 01:28:39,345
I'm taking you home.

1016
01:28:46,857 --> 01:28:49,052
I'd been walking for hours.

1017
01:28:50,293 --> 01:28:53,091
I came to a river.
There was no crossing.

1018
01:28:54,765 --> 01:29:00,203
I had no choice
but to jump in and just hope.

1019
01:29:34,702 --> 01:29:36,363
He was too heavy.

1020
01:29:36,471 --> 01:29:37,699
I was choking.

1021
01:29:39,307 --> 01:29:41,935
I couldn't breathe.

1022
01:29:42,043 --> 01:29:44,204
I couldn't breathe.

1023
01:29:44,312 --> 01:29:46,337
And so...

1024
01:29:47,782 --> 01:29:50,307
I let him go.

1025
01:30:23,350 --> 01:30:25,613
I'm sorry.

1026
01:30:30,723 --> 01:30:32,884
I love you.

1027
01:30:32,992 --> 01:30:34,983
I love you so much.
