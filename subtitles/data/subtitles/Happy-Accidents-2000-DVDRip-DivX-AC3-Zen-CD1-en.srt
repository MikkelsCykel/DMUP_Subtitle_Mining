1
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,029
Murder.

2
00:01:52,738 --> 00:01:54,531
Oh, God, Sam. Murder?

3
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:57,159
- It wasn't me.
- Nobody could understand this.

4
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:58,243
It's too much.

5
00:01:58,327 --> 00:02:01,538
I thought it would be easier
if I told you a little at a time.

6
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:03,874
It would sink in a little at a time.

7
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:06,001
Sink in a little at a time?

8
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:09,796
You just dropped an emotional...

9
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,632
...anvil on my head.

10
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:14,551
Look at me. I'm flat as a pancake.

11
00:02:15,511 --> 00:02:19,348
- Are you even listening to me?
- I'm listening to you, Ruby.

12
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,142
I'm listening to you with all my heart...

13
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:24,228
...and that's why I had to tell you.

14
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:26,730
That's why you need to understand.

15
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:32,486
<i>And that's when I felt it.</i>

16
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,404
<i>Felt what?</i>

17
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:35,781
The fist.

18
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:40,827
- What kind of fist?
- Pressing on me. Paralyzing me.

19
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:46,834
It's so stupid, because,
based on what he had just told me...

20
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:51,046
...I should have punched him with that fist,
in the other eye this time.

21
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:54,550
I should have just kicked him out!

22
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,134
But I couldn't.

23
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:01,390
Do you love Sam?

24
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:11,024
Dear, you know, there's really not much
I can do to help you...

25
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:12,651
...if you don't talk to me.

26
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:15,737
But it's not about me. It's about Sam.

27
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:20,450
After all our time together and all
our sessions, you still believe that?

28
00:03:22,578 --> 00:03:24,246
I must suck.

29
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:29,918
You say it's about Sam.
Okay. Let's talk about Sam, and we'll see.

30
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,964
But let's include this revelation
in our thinking.

31
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,091
Crank it back, just rewind.

32
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:39,469
Tell me again, how did you meet him?

33
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:41,430
Tell me what it was like.

34
00:03:44,016 --> 00:03:45,559
It was exciting.

35
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:50,189
<i>It was like a roller-coaster ride.</i>

36
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,818
<i>The world, the night, the lights,</i>
<i>everything was...</i>

37
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:57,154
...fast.

38
00:03:58,614 --> 00:04:00,115
Zip-a-dee-doo-dah.

39
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:03,118
Sounds like falling in love to me.

40
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:07,122
Sam said something like that.

41
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:09,416
First time we met.

42
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:12,753
Something about love and time.

43
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:17,049
- He said your heart...
...is like a clock measuring time...

44
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:21,386
...and one's emotional state
determines the flow of time.

45
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,347
It speeds it up or slows it down.

46
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:27,726
- So, time is a personal thing.
- Sure.

47
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:30,354
Time is an emotional thing.
That's what you're saying.

48
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:37,861
But good things seem to just fly by...

49
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,739
...like the best times in life.

50
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,492
Like what?

51
00:04:44,243 --> 00:04:46,870
- Like...
- Like falling in love.

52
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:54,503
Oh, my God! I'm late for work.
I totally spaced.

53
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,005
See what I mean?

54
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:02,344
<i>That was the morning we first met.</i>

55
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:07,307
<i>I got fired that afternoon.</i>

56
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,186
I cannot give you my name, sir.

57
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,605
Do you want the number, or...

58
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:15,399
My number?

59
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,569
Tell me what you look like first.

60
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,864
So. What did he say?

61
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:24,449
He said I took too much time.

62
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:26,952
That's men for you, always in a rush.

63
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,453
Shit, you're helpful.

64
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,376
I was too helpful.

65
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:40,632
You know, let me talk to my boss.
I'll see if I can get you a job teaching ESL.

66
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:43,218
- How's your grammar?
- Fuckin' great.

67
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:46,388
So, over breakfast last month, he goes:

68
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,391
"Do you believe in Christ as your savior?"

69
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:52,769
- You're kidding?
- I'm telling you the truth.

70
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:56,899
Five months, not a peep
about anything remotely spiritual, right?

71
00:05:56,982 --> 00:05:58,942
All carnal. The guy just wants to fuck.

72
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:01,236
- Then he just springs this on you?
- That's right.

73
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:03,488
So, I tell him, "I'm Jewish, you idiot.

74
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:05,115
"I'm a Jew.

75
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,118
"I mean, what do you think,
I'm a Jew for Jesus or something?"

76
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:12,581
He freaks out. I freak out.
It turns out he's a Jew for Jesus.

77
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,752
- And he never told you?
- Not a peep.

78
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:18,795
That's the Trojan horse strategy.

79
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:25,677
Do you remember Steven? The Adventist?

80
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:29,640
The religious ones
are really sneaky that way, right?

81
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:31,975
- You got a mug shot?
- Oh, my God!

82
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:33,769
You're kidding!

83
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:36,730
- I think he belongs in the box, please.
- I know.

84
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:39,691
We need a bigger box.
I don't think they're all going to fit.

85
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:41,485
Unless Ruby wants her own.

86
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:44,404
Guess what, Claire?
You have more in there than I do.

87
00:06:44,488 --> 00:06:46,657
- I don't think so.
- Count them up.

88
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,284
Don't count. That's depressing.

89
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:54,831
I was fired today.

90
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:58,168
Ruby, did you ever actually fix any of them?

91
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:01,672
She doesn't really fix them.
She goes in there to fix them...

92
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:06,426
...and discovers that they're permanently
broken, then she ends up dumping them.

93
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:10,472
- All those men.
- You mean, all those problems.

94
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:12,516
The narcissist.

95
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,143
The abductee.

96
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:16,728
The bad drummer.

97
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:18,146
<i>The artist.</i>

98
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:22,067
Are you leaving me?
Or are you leaving my work?

99
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:24,069
<i>The bad actor.</i>

100
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:27,990
Don't come crying to me
when I'm famous and you're, like:

101
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:30,784
"Ned, please take me back." It's over.

102
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:32,578
<i>The fetishist.</i>

103
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:35,122
I should have expected this.

104
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:36,832
It's happened before.

105
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:38,917
<i>The Frenchman.</i>

106
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:40,127
<i>Fini?</i>

107
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,295
<i>The junkie.</i>

108
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:43,338
Okay, enough.

109
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:44,923
I'm not fixing anymore.

110
00:07:45,007 --> 00:07:48,218
I'm not in that business anymore.
My fixing days are over.

111
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:50,596
Tell that to your therapist, you kook.

112
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:53,682
That's what she tells me to say.

113
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:56,518
I'm sorry about the job, baby.

114
00:07:56,894 --> 00:07:58,979
<i>- I've got one question for you.</i>
<i>- Shoot.</i>

115
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:01,899
Do the words "Jesus Christ"
mean anything to you?

116
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:05,527
- I'm a painter. I paint.
- What, houses?

117
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:09,698
I'm a real painter. I'm having a big show
in a couple of months.

118
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:13,368
- Hey.
- Ned.

119
00:08:13,452 --> 00:08:15,204
- How you doing?
- All right. You?

120
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:18,415
Great. Have you seen me
since this happened?

121
00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:21,710
Pretty good?
I've been doing a lot of lifting weights.

122
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:24,838
Doing a lot of free-weights,
isometrics, my body fat's way low.

123
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:26,673
<i>So, what was it like?</i>

124
00:08:28,926 --> 00:08:30,761
<i>What was it about him?</i>

125
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:34,681
For God's sake, swing it around here.

126
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:36,475
- Starboard. Right.
- Starboard.

127
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:38,060
That's Victor.

128
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:41,230
His sister went down in the "Titanic".
He always talks about it.

129
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:44,024
- She went down on the "Titanic".
- I know. I remember.

130
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:47,819
Old folks are great.
You should hear the stories.

131
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:49,154
Wow.

132
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:53,825
- You an artist?
- No. It's just a hobby.

133
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,286
Kills time.

134
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,040
<i>What was it about him?</i>

135
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:02,751
<i>Maybe it was his manner.</i>

136
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:05,295
<i>He seemed gentle.</i>

137
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,592
<i>But I didn't think I'd see him again.</i>

138
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:11,718
"I..."

139
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:14,263
<i>He was one of those guys</i>
<i>you meet for a moment...</i>

140
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:19,309
"...that my own needs are important."

141
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:22,521
<i>Better for fantasizing about</i>
<i>than actually sleeping with.</i>

142
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:26,233
"I am willing to find a balance
between my own needs...

143
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:28,318
"...and my concern for others."

144
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:30,153
<i>Better as mysteries.</i>

145
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:34,157
<i>Because we all know what happens</i>
<i>when you take away the mystery.</i>

146
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:35,450
Hi, Ruby.

147
00:09:37,995 --> 00:09:38,954
Hi.

148
00:09:40,706 --> 00:09:42,791
How do you know my name?

149
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:48,547
You left your book in the park.
Your nametag.

150
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:53,218
I looked up your name in the phone book.
I put it back on Page 45, where it was.

151
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,598
You could have just called.

152
00:09:58,307 --> 00:10:01,602
You know. I was in the neighborhood.

153
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:07,024
- Don't you work today?
- It's my day off.

154
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:14,072
- What's it about?
- It's...

155
00:10:16,867 --> 00:10:18,368
It's erotica.

156
00:10:19,203 --> 00:10:20,871
Anaïs Nin.

157
00:10:23,207 --> 00:10:24,708
You didn't peek?

158
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:28,378
What's that?

159
00:10:29,338 --> 00:10:31,215
- What?
- You smell that?

160
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:36,386
It's sublime. It's beautiful.

161
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:38,889
I don't smell anything.

162
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:40,933
It's...

163
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:46,605
The perfume, it's lovely.

164
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:51,527
Thanks.

165
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:55,322
You're not from here, are you?

166
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,699
It's that obvious?

167
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:03,413
- What, are you from the Midwest?
- Dubuque.

168
00:11:04,915 --> 00:11:06,041
Ohio?

169
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:08,836
Actually, it's Iowa. Dubuque, Iowa.

170
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:10,128
It is?

171
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,005
Shit! Okay.

172
00:11:12,756 --> 00:11:15,050
- What?
- Nothing. I'm fine.

173
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:18,136
I'm okay.

174
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:20,556
We don't...

175
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:23,725
We just don't have little ones
like that in Dubuque.

176
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:27,062
But I'm okay. I'm fine.

177
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:31,775
I think I should apologize.
I've been acting a little odd.

178
00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:39,241
I haven't been able to stop
thinking of you since we met...

179
00:11:39,283 --> 00:11:41,785
- But we just met.
- And why you left the book.

180
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:48,709
Look, I don't even know you.

181
00:11:48,876 --> 00:11:50,294
I know.

182
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:53,172
- Deep inside you've wondered about me?
- No.

183
00:11:53,255 --> 00:11:56,133
- And why I'm here in New York City?
- No.

184
00:11:57,843 --> 00:11:59,761
Can we meet? After?

185
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:01,305
After what?

186
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:06,351
Class.

187
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:11,523
My name is Ruby Weaver.

188
00:12:12,191 --> 00:12:14,193
I'm your new teacher.

189
00:12:18,447 --> 00:12:21,867
This is my acquaintance.

190
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,660
What's your name?

191
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:27,372
My name is Sam Deed.
I am from Dubuque, Iowa.

192
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:28,665
Thank you.

193
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,896
Who are you?

194
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,315
Sam Deed.

195
00:12:53,357 --> 00:12:55,984
I know. And what's your agenda?

196
00:12:57,027 --> 00:12:58,153
Agenda?

197
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:02,324
I'm not looking for a relationship right now.
I need balance in my life.

198
00:13:02,366 --> 00:13:04,409
It's really nice to be talking to you.

199
00:13:06,328 --> 00:13:09,623
I'm only here because I liked what you did
in my class today.

200
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:11,208
So...

201
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,669
...are you an army brat?

202
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:17,381
- What's that?
- The languages...

203
00:13:22,386 --> 00:13:24,555
Actually, I've never left Dubuque before.

204
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:28,016
What brings you to New York?

205
00:13:28,058 --> 00:13:29,726
Job at the UN?

206
00:13:32,104 --> 00:13:34,690
- Job at the United Nations?
- No.

207
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:38,193
I came here three months ago and...

208
00:13:51,874 --> 00:13:53,333
Are you okay?

209
00:13:54,418 --> 00:13:55,711
I'm sorry.

210
00:13:56,003 --> 00:13:57,963
You don't have to say anything...

211
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:00,757
...if it makes you uncomfortable.

212
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:03,218
Do you like music?

213
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:07,931
- Yeah. Doesn't everybody?
- I love music.

214
00:14:08,432 --> 00:14:11,351
- You're not a drummer, are you?
- No. I like to listen to it.

215
00:14:11,435 --> 00:14:14,897
Would you like to listen to music with me
tomorrow night?

216
00:14:24,323 --> 00:14:26,992
Come up for a sec. I'm almost ready.

217
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:44,843
- Hi. I'm ready.
- Hey.

218
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:47,596
Are you ready to rock?

219
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:51,808
What?

220
00:15:04,154 --> 00:15:07,741
You know, if you told me you wanted
to just listen to music...

221
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:09,409
...I do have a CD player.

222
00:15:09,493 --> 00:15:11,620
The man said these were warmer.

223
00:15:14,665 --> 00:15:16,291
Can you do this?

224
00:15:17,501 --> 00:15:18,585
Yeah.

225
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:22,589
You look great.

226
00:15:23,632 --> 00:15:24,800
Thanks.

227
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:28,637
I thought that we were gonna go out, so I...

228
00:15:30,055 --> 00:15:31,598
...dressed up.

229
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:42,109
Is this typical of your musical taste?

230
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,240
I love this.

231
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:49,908
This is...

232
00:15:54,872 --> 00:15:55,998
Wine?

233
00:16:01,003 --> 00:16:02,504
What do you call this?

234
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:05,215
French Merlot.

235
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:07,926
Don't sound French to me.

236
00:16:08,886 --> 00:16:12,181
Do you want to dance to this
French Merlot with me?

237
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:18,270
- This is like an "Art of War" thing, right?
- What?

238
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:22,024
You just confuse your foe,
and then you move in fast for the kill?

239
00:16:22,107 --> 00:16:24,026
Come on. Life is short.

240
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,781
- What are you on? Ecstasy?
- Ecstasy?

241
00:16:29,865 --> 00:16:31,825
Why are you so happy?

242
00:16:32,201 --> 00:16:34,161
'Cause I'm here with you.

243
00:16:34,536 --> 00:16:36,496
But you don't even know me...

244
00:16:37,206 --> 00:16:38,373
...at all.

245
00:16:42,336 --> 00:16:43,670
I'm sorry.

246
00:16:49,593 --> 00:16:53,430
It's just that where I'm from,
courting rituals are...

247
00:16:53,514 --> 00:16:55,224
...really abbreviated.

248
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:57,768
I'm sorry.

249
00:16:57,935 --> 00:17:00,103
"Courting rituals"?

250
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:02,064
What are we, birds?

251
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:06,068
You could show me.

252
00:17:06,735 --> 00:17:09,571
- Show you what?
- How to court you.

253
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:14,076
This is new.

254
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:17,538
The man asking the woman
how she wants to be seduced.

255
00:17:19,164 --> 00:17:21,375
Like a role-reversal strategy?

256
00:17:22,251 --> 00:17:23,585
No.

257
00:17:25,379 --> 00:17:27,172
There's no strategy.

258
00:17:27,548 --> 00:17:31,093
I just liked talking to you
that day in that park.

259
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:33,387
I think you're really...

260
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:37,558
...great, and I'd like to get to know you.

261
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:41,436
And I think the reason
why I'm acting so awkward...

262
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,983
...it's because I'm worried
about acting awkward. That's all.

263
00:17:48,652 --> 00:17:51,822
- You want to know how to court me?
- I would.

264
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:57,536
Take off this shit, put on something good,
and pour me some more wine.

265
00:18:11,884 --> 00:18:13,635
<i>So, that's how it happened.</i>

266
00:18:13,677 --> 00:18:16,180
<i>Like I told you, fast.</i>

267
00:18:17,389 --> 00:18:19,474
<i>It was brilliant strategy.</i>

268
00:18:19,725 --> 00:18:22,186
<i>He tricked me into picking up him.</i>

269
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:24,813
<i>He'd never have figured it out on his own.</i>

270
00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:33,363
I love you.

271
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:39,870
<i>So that's when you started</i>
<i>to become suspicious, correct?</i>

272
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:42,080
<i>No. It was after that.</i>

273
00:18:42,164 --> 00:18:44,541
It was definitely after he moved in.

274
00:18:45,918 --> 00:18:48,420
When was that? When did he move in?

275
00:18:48,754 --> 00:18:50,005
Later that week.

276
00:18:50,881 --> 00:18:54,259
José couldn't put him up anymore.
He needed a place to stay.

277
00:18:54,343 --> 00:18:57,387
Didn't it occur to you at the time...

278
00:18:57,471 --> 00:19:01,058
...that this kind of compulsive behavior
is repetitive for you?

279
00:19:01,308 --> 00:19:04,353
It's classic codependency.
It's why you came to see me.

280
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:06,897
This is what you don't want anymore
in your life.

281
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,774
This is what we've been working on.

282
00:19:08,857 --> 00:19:11,735
I mean, Sam has a problem...

283
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:14,571
...and you make sacrifices to fix it.

284
00:19:14,655 --> 00:19:16,698
But it wasn't a sacrifice.

285
00:19:17,407 --> 00:19:18,825
It was great.

286
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:20,869
Oh, my God!

287
00:19:20,953 --> 00:19:22,704
<i>I was really happy.</i>

288
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:26,542
<i>After all the boozers and fuck-ups</i>
<i>and gender floppers...</i>

289
00:19:29,628 --> 00:19:34,341
<i>I mean, Sam, he could be</i>
<i>over the top sometimes, but it was fun.</i>

290
00:19:35,843 --> 00:19:38,303
- Sweetie, you want to go in?
- Go in there?

291
00:19:38,387 --> 00:19:42,266
But listen, it wasn't like I just
jumped blindly into this relationship.

292
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:44,268
Are you sure you don't want to go in?

293
00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:46,270
What is this? Why would I want to go in?

294
00:19:46,311 --> 00:19:48,105
<i>I was very cautious.</i>

295
00:19:48,522 --> 00:19:50,190
<i>Very cautious.</i>

296
00:19:50,274 --> 00:19:51,358
You pass.

297
00:19:51,441 --> 00:19:52,734
Let's see it. Come on.

298
00:19:53,235 --> 00:19:56,321
<i>At first there didn't seem</i>
<i>like there was anything to worry about.</i>

299
00:19:56,405 --> 00:19:59,992
<i>Sam always had a clever explanation</i>
<i>for everything.</i>

300
00:20:00,075 --> 00:20:05,038
I lost a dare to a friend at a Stop & Shop.
If you scan me, I'm a dozen bananas.

301
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,711
<i>Even his friend José</i>
<i>saw good colors in my aura.</i>

302
00:20:10,794 --> 00:20:13,172
<i>Said he felt really good about us.</i>

303
00:20:13,589 --> 00:20:15,757
<i>Like we were kind of meant for each other.</i>

304
00:20:15,841 --> 00:20:18,635
This is great for the relationship.
It's perfect.

305
00:20:20,512 --> 00:20:24,224
Our relationship
has to be about trust, and...

306
00:20:24,308 --> 00:20:29,104
<i>We both told each other everything</i>
<i>about ourselves, about our families.</i>

307
00:20:29,146 --> 00:20:32,065
We went to the Al-Anon meetings
every week.

308
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:35,110
My mother, she took the brunt of it,
of course.

309
00:20:36,153 --> 00:20:37,696
But it worked.

310
00:20:38,113 --> 00:20:39,573
He doesn't drink anymore.

311
00:20:39,656 --> 00:20:41,783
<i>That's when he first told me</i>
<i>about his parents.</i>

312
00:20:41,867 --> 00:20:45,037
I really don't talk to them much anymore,
since I left Dubuque.

313
00:20:45,495 --> 00:20:46,997
<i>And his sister.</i>

314
00:20:47,497 --> 00:20:49,791
She fell out of an elm tree.

315
00:20:51,585 --> 00:20:53,378
It was an accident.

316
00:20:54,171 --> 00:20:56,340
And so after that, I had to...

317
00:20:56,423 --> 00:20:58,342
I couldn't stay in Dubuque.

318
00:20:58,425 --> 00:21:00,636
And that's why you came to New York?

319
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,889
Do you have any pictures of her?

320
00:21:07,643 --> 00:21:10,187
I don't like to live in the past.

321
00:21:11,688 --> 00:21:13,982
Thank you for telling me, Sammy.

322
00:21:16,902 --> 00:21:19,488
- Hi. How much?
- $8.75.

323
00:21:20,239 --> 00:21:21,990
<i>Then I found the photos.</i>

324
00:21:22,783 --> 00:21:25,035
There you are. Thank you.

325
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:27,412
<i>I didn't want to think he lied.</i>

326
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,165
<i>Maybe he forgot.</i>

327
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:33,210
<i>But how could he forget?</i>

328
00:21:37,881 --> 00:21:39,132
<i>I let it slide.</i>

329
00:21:42,052 --> 00:21:44,179
<i>I started to notice other things.</i>

330
00:21:45,848 --> 00:21:48,183
Just little things.

331
00:21:48,809 --> 00:21:50,811
Like he's scared of dogs.

332
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:52,396
Miniatures.

333
00:21:52,688 --> 00:21:54,147
I mean, terrified.

334
00:21:54,231 --> 00:21:57,317
- Maybe he got bit as a kid.
- Maybe.

335
00:21:57,526 --> 00:21:59,111
Talks in his sleep.

336
00:21:59,653 --> 00:22:01,738
That's a problem for you?

337
00:22:01,822 --> 00:22:04,408
It's just the things he says.

338
00:22:04,575 --> 00:22:06,285
Break the causal chain.

339
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:16,962
<i>And then everyday normal things,</i>
<i>just seem really new to him.</i>

340
00:22:17,045 --> 00:22:20,007
Oh, God. You're being so ridiculous!

341
00:22:20,757 --> 00:22:21,758
God!

342
00:22:23,802 --> 00:22:25,888
He has spells, Gretchen!

343
00:22:27,931 --> 00:22:30,434
Spells? What do you mean?

344
00:22:31,518 --> 00:22:36,064
<i>Sometimes he just stares at things.</i>
<i>His eyes get all glazed over.</i>

345
00:22:36,481 --> 00:22:38,150
<i>Like he's in a trance.</i>

346
00:22:40,152 --> 00:22:42,613
<i>It's like he's really far away.</i>

347
00:22:43,155 --> 00:22:44,448
<i>It's weird.</i>

348
00:22:45,782 --> 00:22:47,743
Does it happen during sex?

349
00:22:47,951 --> 00:22:49,912
- No.
- Then don't worry about it.

350
00:22:49,953 --> 00:22:54,166
If these spells were happening during sex,
you know, then I'd worry.

351
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:58,587
That usually means they're thinking about
someone else, you know?

352
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:00,881
That's not Sam.

353
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:04,009
You know what he said to me
the other night?

354
00:23:04,134 --> 00:23:06,094
<i>- What?</i>
<i>- He said...</i>

355
00:23:06,845 --> 00:23:10,057
You know, I've never told a woman
the things I've told you.

356
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,767
You are the first and...

357
00:23:13,018 --> 00:23:14,019
...the only.

358
00:23:15,145 --> 00:23:17,731
You're the one and only.

359
00:23:19,775 --> 00:23:21,401
You know...

360
00:23:23,028 --> 00:23:24,530
I feel like...

361
00:23:26,907 --> 00:23:31,161
...my whole life
has just been a journey into your arms.

362
00:23:34,206 --> 00:23:36,625
<i>Oh, my Larry. Are you kidding me?</i>

363
00:23:37,876 --> 00:23:40,796
Kick him out now
while you got the chance, sister.

364
00:23:40,838 --> 00:23:43,882
I guess you had to be there.

365
00:23:44,508 --> 00:23:48,011
You are this incurable romantic,
like, thwarted back...

366
00:23:48,095 --> 00:23:51,223
...to 1955, where you think
you are his first love.

367
00:23:51,306 --> 00:23:56,270
You know, men only say that kind of shit
when they got some agenda goin' on.

368
00:23:56,353 --> 00:23:58,522
He meant it. I mean, I think he meant it.

369
00:23:58,605 --> 00:24:02,067
"I am willing to find a balance
between my own needs...

370
00:24:02,568 --> 00:24:04,820
"...and my concern for others.

371
00:24:06,864 --> 00:24:09,783
"I am learning to love myself
more every day."

372
00:24:24,548 --> 00:24:27,509
<i>Maybe I shouldn't have been so paranoid.</i>

373
00:24:28,177 --> 00:24:29,928
What is it? What is he on?

374
00:24:30,012 --> 00:24:33,265
<i>Maybe I should have just trusted him,</i>
<i>the way he said he trusted me.</i>

375
00:24:33,348 --> 00:24:34,850
Should I worry?

376
00:24:35,392 --> 00:24:36,643
Only...

377
00:24:36,977 --> 00:24:38,562
...if you love sailing.

378
00:24:39,605 --> 00:24:41,148
It's prescription Dramamine.

379
00:24:41,231 --> 00:24:45,402
It's prescribed for people who suffer
severe distress at sea, seasickness.

380
00:24:45,485 --> 00:24:48,488
Are you planning a cruise?

381
00:24:49,656 --> 00:24:50,866
<i>Sammy?</i>

382
00:24:52,826 --> 00:24:54,912
Guess what today is?

383
00:24:55,204 --> 00:24:57,915
<i>But I'd been burned so many times before.</i>

384
00:25:01,627 --> 00:25:03,587
"So, that's how it happened".

385
00:25:06,465 --> 00:25:09,301
That's how I learned who I was living with.

386
00:25:38,413 --> 00:25:41,250
Hey, baby. Guess what day it is today?

387
00:25:44,461 --> 00:25:46,463
Who is Chrystie Delancey?

388
00:26:16,118 --> 00:26:17,578
She's a girl.

389
00:26:18,328 --> 00:26:20,372
Are you sleeping with her?

390
00:26:24,209 --> 00:26:28,046
"You're the one and only" maybe.
God. Gretchen was right.

391
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:31,592
You're a hypocrite.
You're a liar and you're a cheat.

392
00:26:31,675 --> 00:26:33,218
I am not a cheat.

393
00:26:34,219 --> 00:26:37,014
What's this? Prescription Dramamine?

394
00:26:37,264 --> 00:26:40,642
Planning a little cruise on "The Love Boat"
with Ms. Delancey?

395
00:26:40,976 --> 00:26:44,271
- It's not what you think.
- I don't know what to think!

396
00:26:44,354 --> 00:26:46,857
You're fucking someone else.

397
00:26:47,524 --> 00:26:50,652
You are the one and only.

398
00:26:51,486 --> 00:26:53,447
Baby, that is the truth.

399
00:26:56,033 --> 00:26:57,784
I got you some roses.

400
00:26:58,368 --> 00:27:00,245
A whole dozen of them.

401
00:27:00,329 --> 00:27:02,664
It's our three-month anniversary.

402
00:27:04,458 --> 00:27:07,544
- Baby, don't cry.
- They're carnations.

403
00:27:08,045 --> 00:27:11,298
Or is that another thing
they don't have in Dubuque?

404
00:27:11,507 --> 00:27:15,219
You think I haven't noticed
your little idiosyncrasies?

405
00:27:16,386 --> 00:27:18,055
Your spells?

406
00:27:18,514 --> 00:27:20,182
What's going on?

407
00:27:21,225 --> 00:27:23,227
Don't give me any bullshit.

408
00:27:31,193 --> 00:27:32,528
Okay.

409
00:27:36,657 --> 00:27:38,116
I'm listening.

410
00:27:43,121 --> 00:27:44,623
I'm different.

411
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:48,126
You're gay.

412
00:27:49,253 --> 00:27:53,382
You're a Jew for Jesus?
It's that tattoo. It's a cult.

413
00:27:53,423 --> 00:27:56,385
You're a Branch Davidian?
You're a survivalist!

414
00:27:56,426 --> 00:27:59,179
You're a pimp,
and Chrystie Delancey is one of your sluts?

415
00:27:59,263 --> 00:28:00,722
I'm not a pimp!

416
00:28:00,806 --> 00:28:02,933
What then?

417
00:28:07,604 --> 00:28:10,107
Okay, look, I'll say it. All right?

418
00:28:12,526 --> 00:28:14,278
I'm not from Dubuque.

419
00:28:16,738 --> 00:28:19,324
Okay. You're not from Dubuque.

420
00:28:20,659 --> 00:28:22,744
So where are you from then?

421
00:28:23,871 --> 00:28:25,080
Dubuque.

422
00:28:25,497 --> 00:28:28,083
I'm not from Dubuque in the way you think.

423
00:28:28,166 --> 00:28:30,794
- How many ways are there?
- I'm not from your Dubuque.

424
00:28:30,878 --> 00:28:33,297
Since when is Dubuque mine?
I've never been to Ohio!

425
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:35,132
- Iowa.
- Whatever.

426
00:28:35,966 --> 00:28:39,219
I'm just saying that my Dubuque
is different from your Dubuque.

427
00:28:39,303 --> 00:28:41,263
- How?
- It doesn't exist.

428
00:28:41,346 --> 00:28:43,932
- You just said it's in Idaho.
- Iowa!

429
00:28:44,266 --> 00:28:46,143
- So your Dubuque doesn't exist?
- Yet.

430
00:28:46,226 --> 00:28:47,311
- Yet!
- Yet.

431
00:28:49,021 --> 00:28:51,273
So when will your Dubuque exist?

432
00:28:55,903 --> 00:28:57,905
2470...

433
00:28:58,238 --> 00:28:59,239
...AD.

434
00:29:00,324 --> 00:29:03,744
That's in 471 years...

435
00:29:04,203 --> 00:29:05,662
...from now.

436
00:29:07,372 --> 00:29:09,208
471 years?

437
00:29:09,708 --> 00:29:11,752
Not counting leap years.

438
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:15,172
See, when I say "my Dubuque,"
I don't mean the present Dubuque...

439
00:29:15,255 --> 00:29:16,507
...which is your Dubuque.

440
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:20,135
I mean the future Dubuque,
which is where I'm from.

441
00:29:21,637 --> 00:29:24,097
- The future.
- Oh, God.

442
00:29:24,348 --> 00:29:26,725
At least, forward on
the time-space continuum...

443
00:29:26,808 --> 00:29:29,978
...which is how your scientific establishment
would understand it.

444
00:29:30,729 --> 00:29:33,148
It's called "back-travel."

445
00:29:34,274 --> 00:29:39,279
That's what I meant about who I am.
I'm a back-traveler.

446
00:29:39,947 --> 00:29:43,492
I know it's hard to understand, and...

447
00:29:43,534 --> 00:29:47,996
...that's why it was hard to tell you,
because I knew you'd be real upset.

448
00:29:56,463 --> 00:29:58,924
I didn't think you'd laugh in my face.

449
00:29:59,675 --> 00:30:02,553
Come on. You're from the future?

450
00:30:06,181 --> 00:30:08,433
I am from the future.

451
00:30:08,517 --> 00:30:10,561
I'm from the year 2470.

452
00:30:10,644 --> 00:30:15,190
I was born on May 8, 2439,
in Dubuque, Iowa...

453
00:30:15,232 --> 00:30:17,025
...on the Atlantic coast.

454
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:21,321
That's right, the Atlantic coast.

455
00:30:21,405 --> 00:30:25,033
It moved inland,
after the icecaps melted in 2330.

456
00:30:25,075 --> 00:30:27,953
That was five years
after the Great Infestation eliminated...

457
00:30:28,036 --> 00:30:31,665
...all plant and vegetable matter,
trees and flowers and domestic pets.

458
00:30:31,748 --> 00:30:33,959
Cats, hamsters, dogs.

459
00:30:34,042 --> 00:30:35,878
Okay, don't touch me.

460
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:38,547
Don't worry. I'm a Biological.
I'm just like you.

461
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:42,843
Back in 2470, most people
are corporate-sponsored Gene Dupes...

462
00:30:42,926 --> 00:30:46,013
...manufactured in the Philippines.
My parents were Anachronists.

463
00:30:46,096 --> 00:30:49,391
- And they believed in doing it the old way.
- Stop it!

464
00:30:49,433 --> 00:30:51,143
What? I'm just being honest!

465
00:30:51,268 --> 00:30:55,772
My parents raised my sister and me
on a reservation with other Anachronists.

466
00:30:55,856 --> 00:30:58,066
The Gene Dupes kept us there.
They hated us.

467
00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:02,321
We were always fighting for our nostalgia
rights. My father was a freedom fighter.

468
00:31:02,404 --> 00:31:05,866
He led the battle
to have the Ban on Beauty lifted, in 2451.

469
00:31:05,949 --> 00:31:09,328
The Gene Dupes finally got him.
Want to know what his crime was?

470
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:15,292
Maybe you've heard it before.

471
00:31:15,959 --> 00:31:19,796
"I'm as a free as a bird now

472
00:31:20,506 --> 00:31:23,050
"And this bird will never

473
00:31:23,425 --> 00:31:25,010
"change"

474
00:31:26,261 --> 00:31:29,264
My mother, she taught ancient languages
in a local school.

475
00:31:29,348 --> 00:31:31,308
Spanish, French, Ebonics.

476
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:34,937
She died of cancer when I was 25.
You know, there's still no cure.

477
00:31:35,187 --> 00:31:39,775
But I'll never forget what she told me
while I was watching her deconstruct.

478
00:31:40,108 --> 00:31:43,820
She said to me, "Make your sister proud."

479
00:31:43,946 --> 00:31:46,281
You know, not her, my sister.

480
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:49,618
But she died, too. 2468.

481
00:31:49,785 --> 00:31:52,079
She was 14. I mean, 14.

482
00:31:52,913 --> 00:31:56,917
That was a year after they banned
back-travel. But that didn't stop anybody.

483
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,962
If you had guts you'd get an
Underground Agent to send you back.

484
00:32:00,045 --> 00:32:02,798
And that's what I did.
That was six months ago.

485
00:32:05,634 --> 00:32:07,052
There.

486
00:32:08,262 --> 00:32:10,222
Now you know everything.

487
00:32:10,514 --> 00:32:11,765
Any more questions?

488
00:32:12,307 --> 00:32:13,267
Yes.

489
00:32:14,017 --> 00:32:16,812
Who is Chrystie Delancey?

490
00:32:18,981 --> 00:32:20,148
<i>You're killing me.</i>

491
00:32:20,524 --> 00:32:23,986
Lynyrd Skynyrd's "Freebird"?
A protest song?

492
00:32:24,027 --> 00:32:27,948
So, what, everybody's
a redneck in the future?

493
00:32:28,323 --> 00:32:30,617
It's really hilarious, Gretch!

494
00:32:30,701 --> 00:32:33,829
He's dead serious.
You should have seen the look in his eye.

495
00:32:33,871 --> 00:32:35,873
You want me to get the ex-files?

496
00:32:35,956 --> 00:32:37,958
Have you got a mug shot yet?

497
00:32:38,041 --> 00:32:40,836
Why must they always be drawn to me?

498
00:32:43,755 --> 00:32:45,132
I'm sorry.

499
00:32:46,216 --> 00:32:49,344
All right, don't keep me
in suspense anymore.

500
00:32:49,428 --> 00:32:50,888
Who's this Delancey ho?

501
00:32:50,929 --> 00:32:52,306
My contact!

502
00:32:52,598 --> 00:32:54,391
What kind of contact?

503
00:32:54,474 --> 00:32:58,854
Another back-traveler who can orient you.
Chrystie Delancey was my contact.

504
00:32:58,896 --> 00:33:01,565
I wrote her name down
so I wouldn't forget it.

505
00:33:01,648 --> 00:33:03,901
I found her.
She filled me in on current events.

506
00:33:03,984 --> 00:33:08,280
Taught me how to flag a cab, and gave me
my back-story, and then she left.

507
00:33:08,363 --> 00:33:12,159
- "Back-story"? What?
- False documents. A driver's license.

508
00:33:12,242 --> 00:33:14,703
Birth certificate.
You know, so you can assimilate.

509
00:33:15,412 --> 00:33:19,416
That's good.
Are you "assimilating" with her?

510
00:33:19,499 --> 00:33:22,211
No! She's old and...

511
00:33:22,961 --> 00:33:24,671
...wrinkled and...

512
00:33:24,755 --> 00:33:26,924
Looks pretty hot in your drawings!

513
00:33:30,677 --> 00:33:33,347
That's not Chrystie Delancey...

514
00:33:33,514 --> 00:33:34,515
...baby.

515
00:33:35,307 --> 00:33:36,808
<i>- "It's you."</i>
<i>- What?</i>

516
00:33:36,892 --> 00:33:39,978
That's what he tells me.
The drawings are of me.

517
00:33:41,271 --> 00:33:44,107
There's just a little something
missing from your story.

518
00:33:44,191 --> 00:33:45,609
Sanity.

519
00:33:45,692 --> 00:33:49,571
That, and the part
where you walk him to the door...

520
00:33:49,613 --> 00:33:51,323
...and you open it and you say:

521
00:33:51,406 --> 00:33:54,117
"Just get the fuck out of my apartment!
Get the hell out!"

522
00:33:54,201 --> 00:33:55,452
<i>I tried.</i>

523
00:33:56,203 --> 00:33:58,288
<i>But then he starts into this story...</i>

524
00:34:01,458 --> 00:34:05,254
I found a photograph of you.
And that's what these drawings are.

525
00:34:05,295 --> 00:34:06,672
Of that photograph.

526
00:34:06,755 --> 00:34:09,716
- Where's this photograph?
- The future.

527
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:13,095
- What?
- You can't bring non-carbon...

528
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:16,515
...based, inanimate matter back with you.

529
00:34:18,642 --> 00:34:22,521
I know the drawings aren't very good.
Okay, blame me for that.

530
00:34:25,482 --> 00:34:27,317
But that's the way that...

531
00:34:27,526 --> 00:34:29,570
...I remember that photo.

532
00:34:29,862 --> 00:34:30,988
Okay?

533
00:34:32,656 --> 00:34:36,243
Look, you could say that they're drawings...

534
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:46,545
Look, I can explain. Okay?

535
00:34:48,338 --> 00:34:51,466
After my sister died, I kind of lost it.

536
00:34:51,508 --> 00:34:53,510
<i>After his sister died...</i>

537
00:34:55,804 --> 00:35:00,475
<i>She was the only family he had left.</i>
<i>And now there was no one.</i>

538
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:03,061
<i>I guess Anachronists are big on families.</i>

539
00:35:03,145 --> 00:35:04,396
One day...

540
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:06,481
<i>One day...</i>

541
00:35:11,445 --> 00:35:16,200
<i>He says he was looking for a certain piece</i>
<i>of obsolete, pre-millennium technology...</i>

542
00:35:19,786 --> 00:35:22,289
<i>Instead, he finds this photograph.</i>

543
00:35:23,916 --> 00:35:28,420
<i>I stared at it for hours.</i>
<i>Those hours, they turned into days.</i>

544
00:35:29,254 --> 00:35:32,716
<i>Every time I shut my eyes to go to sleep...</i>

545
00:35:40,432 --> 00:35:44,186
And suddenly I remembered everything
my dad fought for.

546
00:35:44,269 --> 00:35:48,023
That the past had potential,
that the past had meaning.

547
00:35:48,273 --> 00:35:52,569
<i>So, I leaped into the temporal stream,</i>
<i>and I came back...</i>

548
00:36:02,913 --> 00:36:05,499
To find your face.

549
00:36:10,462 --> 00:36:12,464
My God, I'm gonna cry.

550
00:36:13,257 --> 00:36:15,843
He was going to kill himself.

551
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:20,556
He gave up all he had in the future
to travel through time to find me.

552
00:36:21,431 --> 00:36:26,353
It's one of the most romantic, crazy,
fucked-up lies a guy has ever told me.

553
00:36:27,437 --> 00:36:30,941
So, what did you say?
How do you respond to that?

554
00:36:32,609 --> 00:36:34,403
Oh, my God!

555
00:36:35,612 --> 00:36:36,989
<i>I didn't have time to.</i>

556
00:36:37,072 --> 00:36:41,660
<i>It hit me I'd made arrangements for us</i>
<i>to have dinner at my parents' that night.</i>

557
00:36:41,743 --> 00:36:44,496
The one night I need to be on my toes.

558
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:49,084
I feel so good about having come out.
We can be more honest with each other.

559
00:36:49,168 --> 00:36:53,255
Just once, I wanted to impress them.
Especially after that fiasco with Tab.

560
00:36:53,338 --> 00:36:54,756
Hello, Theodore.

561
00:36:54,798 --> 00:36:59,261
Listen, we're here, and I'm assuming
you're not going to say anything to them.

562
00:36:59,303 --> 00:37:01,930
No. That would violate protocol.

563
00:37:02,181 --> 00:37:03,473
Protocol?

564
00:37:03,807 --> 00:37:06,894
Strict rules of conduct for back-travelers.

565
00:37:06,977 --> 00:37:10,105
You never reveal your identity,
where you're from or your name.

566
00:37:10,189 --> 00:37:11,481
It's absolutely forbidden.

567
00:37:11,565 --> 00:37:14,193
Okay, so this is new.
Sam is not your real name?

568
00:37:14,276 --> 00:37:15,861
- It's not.
- Okay.

569
00:37:15,944 --> 00:37:17,613
What is your real name?

570
00:37:18,822 --> 00:37:21,408
It's in binary code,
so it might not make sense.

571
00:37:21,491 --> 00:37:26,038
But if you really want to know,
it's 011110011...

572
00:37:27,539 --> 00:37:31,627
...110011000110.

573
00:37:31,668 --> 00:37:35,464
Just like on my bar code and my chip.
My contact gave me "Sam Deed."

574
00:37:35,506 --> 00:37:38,884
That's S-A-M, three. D-E-E-D, four.

575
00:37:42,554 --> 00:37:46,183
...so we can identify each other,
also so we can avoid each other.

576
00:37:46,266 --> 00:37:49,061
But protocol prohibits us
from telling anybody any of this.

577
00:37:49,144 --> 00:37:51,230
You just told me.

578
00:37:51,939 --> 00:37:54,358
Haven't you ever tied a tie before?

579
00:37:56,151 --> 00:38:01,114
Dressing rituals went out with the advent of
disposable clothes, back in the early 2200s.

580
00:38:01,198 --> 00:38:03,992
Oh, God.
Just get me through this one night.

581
00:38:05,577 --> 00:38:08,539
You know, Sam,
Ruby tells me that you work at a hospice.

582
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:10,499
Did you study medicine?

583
00:38:16,547 --> 00:38:18,882
No. I drive the van, Lillian.

584
00:38:19,925 --> 00:38:22,219
- I see.
- So where you from, son?

585
00:38:22,302 --> 00:38:25,055
He's from Iowa, Dad.

586
00:38:25,806 --> 00:38:28,100
That's good country out there.

587
00:38:28,183 --> 00:38:29,226
What part?

588
00:38:29,852 --> 00:38:31,562
The Atlantic coast.

589
00:38:32,396 --> 00:38:33,522
Sorry?

590
00:38:33,897 --> 00:38:37,651
- Coast?
- He means the shoreline.

591
00:38:37,734 --> 00:38:39,862
- The Mississippi...
- River.

592
00:38:39,945 --> 00:38:41,280
- Shoreline.
- Right.

593
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:46,702
- Did you go to college out there in Iowa?
- Didn't have to go to college.

594
00:38:46,785 --> 00:38:50,289
They planted everything I needed to know
right here when I was 3.

595
00:38:50,372 --> 00:38:51,874
"Planted"?

596
00:38:52,958 --> 00:38:54,710
Sam is a prodigy.

597
00:38:54,793 --> 00:38:57,379
He speaks five languages fluently.

598
00:38:57,462 --> 00:38:58,839
Right?

599
00:39:01,967 --> 00:39:04,386
- Prodigy.
- Oh, my God.

600
00:39:05,554 --> 00:39:06,513
Not bad.

601
00:39:06,597 --> 00:39:08,849
Is that Homeric or Platonic Greek?

602
00:39:08,932 --> 00:39:10,475
Actually, it's Platonic.

603
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:14,813
Amazing. Fantastic.
You must have big ambitions.

604
00:39:15,439 --> 00:39:18,901
Please tell us,
what brings you to New York?

605
00:39:32,497 --> 00:39:34,541
I came because of...

606
00:39:39,963 --> 00:39:41,256
Okay, Marvin!

607
00:39:41,632 --> 00:39:42,633
Down!

608
00:39:45,636 --> 00:39:46,595
Wow.

609
00:39:47,387 --> 00:39:49,389
I didn't know they were so soft.

610
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:59,274
<i>How is he?</i>

611
00:39:59,316 --> 00:40:00,734
- Who, Dad?
- Yeah.

612
00:40:00,817 --> 00:40:03,612
Working. Always. Buying, selling.

613
00:40:04,238 --> 00:40:06,740
- That's good. Right?
- Sure.

614
00:40:10,369 --> 00:40:12,788
Where did you meet this one? I like him.

615
00:40:13,622 --> 00:40:15,123
- I do.
- You do?

616
00:40:15,207 --> 00:40:18,252
I like him. He's sweet. He's funny.

617
00:40:18,335 --> 00:40:20,128
You think he's funny?

618
00:40:20,504 --> 00:40:21,922
Yes, funny.

619
00:40:25,801 --> 00:40:27,761
Lillian, these are great pickles.

620
00:40:28,512 --> 00:40:29,805
Very nice.

621
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,181
Pickles?

622
00:40:31,265 --> 00:40:32,474
Pickles.

623
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:35,143
You really are funny.

624
00:40:36,436 --> 00:40:39,147
You know, Sam has some incredible ideas
about investment.

625
00:40:39,231 --> 00:40:41,984
- Does he really?
- Very advanced. Very exciting.

626
00:40:42,234 --> 00:40:45,487
Tell us. Something that I should know?

627
00:41:00,335 --> 00:41:01,670
Excuse me.

628
00:41:02,379 --> 00:41:03,672
You all right, son?

629
00:41:03,755 --> 00:41:05,799
Is he all right?

630
00:41:05,883 --> 00:41:09,219
- What's wrong with him?
- I don't know.

631
00:41:10,095 --> 00:41:13,015
- Sammy? Are you all right, baby?
- I'm okay.

632
00:41:29,823 --> 00:41:31,700
It didn't go very well.

633
00:41:31,909 --> 00:41:35,662
I know. I'm sorry.
It's my fault, you know, I...

634
00:41:35,746 --> 00:41:38,665
First the thing with the dog, you know.

635
00:41:38,957 --> 00:41:41,710
I can't believe I left dinner so abruptly.

636
00:41:41,793 --> 00:41:45,172
It's okay. I think they really liked you.

637
00:41:45,464 --> 00:41:47,382
- You think they really liked me?
- Yeah.

638
00:41:47,424 --> 00:41:49,343
- Really?
- It's a first.

639
00:41:50,302 --> 00:41:51,303
Wow!

640
00:41:55,224 --> 00:41:57,935
You gotta tell me what's really going on...

641
00:41:58,810 --> 00:41:59,937
...here.

642
00:42:04,983 --> 00:42:08,987
I would never do anything
to hurt this relationship. I wouldn't.

643
00:42:09,613 --> 00:42:11,240
That's the truth.

644
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:15,160
It's just that...

645
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:18,163
...I have...

646
00:42:20,582 --> 00:42:22,042
...RTDS.

647
00:42:25,128 --> 00:42:29,091
- RTDS?
- Residual Temporal Drag Syndrome.

648
00:42:30,133 --> 00:42:32,678
It's a side effect of back-travel.

649
00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:34,429
Most people call it "drag."

650
00:42:34,471 --> 00:42:37,766
It's like you're jet-lagged.

651
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:42,729
You know, because when you back-travel,
you go back centuries, like that.

652
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,440
The mind is a little slower.

653
00:42:45,482 --> 00:42:50,445
It tries to catch up, but then it gets
confused and throws itself into reverse.

654
00:42:50,487 --> 00:42:55,450
The causality of events flips,
and time flows backwards.

655
00:42:56,451 --> 00:43:01,415
But you shouldn't worry about it, okay?
Because most people adjust in months.

656
00:43:01,915 --> 00:43:03,625
- Most?
- Yeah.

657
00:43:03,667 --> 00:43:07,838
For some people, it just gets worse...

658
00:43:07,921 --> 00:43:11,008
...until everything is in reverse all the time.

659
00:43:11,091 --> 00:43:15,846
They live in a reverse world in their head
until they die.

660
00:43:16,722 --> 00:43:20,976
"Die" is the wrong word.
Until they re-enter their mother's...

661
00:43:21,643 --> 00:43:22,853
...you know.

662
00:43:23,145 --> 00:43:26,773
But you know, that Dramamine
that José got me, that helps.

663
00:43:30,235 --> 00:43:32,279
Maybe you should see someone.

664
00:43:33,864 --> 00:43:36,992
There is someone that could help me.

665
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:38,911
Who?

666
00:43:40,787 --> 00:43:42,414
- Hey!
- You.

667
00:43:47,419 --> 00:43:50,923
<i>Okay. Now it's making sense.</i>

668
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:54,801
He's getting off on it.
You're getting off on it.

669
00:43:54,885 --> 00:43:57,179
It's a kinky role-playing game.

670
00:43:57,262 --> 00:43:58,764
Role-playing?

671
00:43:59,139 --> 00:44:01,683
Look, I know I shouldn't tell you this...

672
00:44:01,767 --> 00:44:05,229
...but Mark and I play a little game also.

673
00:44:06,939 --> 00:44:11,401
Mark likes to pretend
that he's someone else in bed.

674
00:44:12,694 --> 00:44:13,654
Who?

675
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,074
Anthony Michael Hall.

676
00:44:17,574 --> 00:44:19,368
Shut up.

677
00:44:19,409 --> 00:44:23,205
You know, that geeky actor kid
from that "Sixteen Candles" movie.

678
00:44:23,247 --> 00:44:25,040
- I swear to God.
- Shut up.

679
00:44:25,082 --> 00:44:28,794
I'm just telling you this,
because some guys are kinky.

680
00:44:28,877 --> 00:44:33,340
Maybe Sam watched
a lot of "Star Trek" as a kid, you know?

681
00:44:33,757 --> 00:44:36,218
Who cares?
God, as long as the sex is good.

682
00:44:36,385 --> 00:44:39,972
But I don't think that this is about sex.

683
00:44:40,305 --> 00:44:42,224
You're so old-fashioned.

684
00:44:42,266 --> 00:44:44,059
He's from the future.

685
00:44:44,351 --> 00:44:46,728
What the hell do you guys
see in each other anyway?

686
00:44:46,812 --> 00:44:51,650
I have to be able to trust him.
I mean, who is this Delancey bitch?

687
00:44:52,109 --> 00:44:53,735
He told you.

688
00:44:54,611 --> 00:44:55,988
She's his contact.

689
00:44:58,407 --> 00:45:02,077
Come on. I'm telling you.
It's just a game. Play along!

690
00:45:02,661 --> 00:45:07,124
I think that I think
I'm going to have to leave him.

691
00:45:07,833 --> 00:45:10,878
I thought you guys were coming
to the beach house this weekend.

692
00:45:10,961 --> 00:45:13,797
That would be perpetuating the fantasy.

693
00:45:13,881 --> 00:45:16,133
It's not dealing with the problem!

694
00:45:16,592 --> 00:45:19,094
I have a therapist to answer to.

695
00:45:19,428 --> 00:45:23,098
Just make up your mind, sweetie.
I mean, what are you waiting for, proof?

696
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:26,268
That's going to be hard to find. Mark.

697
00:45:28,812 --> 00:45:31,481
<i>It should have been so easy to kick him out.</i>

698
00:45:32,774 --> 00:45:34,943
So why didn't you, right then?

699
00:45:38,739 --> 00:45:40,866
Were you waiting for proof?

700
00:45:43,285 --> 00:45:46,038
No! I don't know.

701
00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:49,041
<i>I guess I was just curious.</i>

702
00:45:49,291 --> 00:45:51,126
<i>I wanted to get to the root of it.</i>

703
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:55,756
<i>Maybe that's what the whole thing was,</i>
<i>just morbid, sick curiosity.</i>

704
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:57,007
How did you find me?

705
00:45:57,090 --> 00:46:00,427
You just had that one, crumbling photo.

706
00:46:00,802 --> 00:46:03,805
The date was
electronically printed on the back.

707
00:46:03,889 --> 00:46:05,641
And the guy in the curio shop...

708
00:46:06,183 --> 00:46:10,103
...he just guessed that it was New York City
because of all the black clothing.

709
00:46:12,064 --> 00:46:13,482
So I took a chance.

710
00:46:13,565 --> 00:46:17,903
I came to this here and now.
Your face was as familiar to me as the sun.

711
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:22,616
<i>I searched and I combed the streets,</i>
<i>and then that day in the park.</i>

712
00:46:23,033 --> 00:46:25,869
<i>It was a happy accident.</i>

713
00:46:27,538 --> 00:46:31,124
- It was just a happy accident?
- That's exactly what it was.

714
00:46:31,208 --> 00:46:32,584
Give me your wallet.

715
00:46:34,419 --> 00:46:36,964
- I don't have any money.
- Give me your wallet.

716
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:39,466
Okay.

717
00:46:46,348 --> 00:46:49,977
- What? I don't know who those people are.
- Let me remind you! Mom and Dad!

718
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:54,982
That's back-story!
My contact gave me that! I told you.

719
00:46:55,065 --> 00:46:57,651
- That's not your sister?
- No.

720
00:46:57,734 --> 00:47:02,364
That's not a photo of your sister?
You said you had no photos.

721
00:47:02,447 --> 00:47:04,700
No. My sister was terrified of dogs.

722
00:47:04,741 --> 00:47:07,536
- I know you don't believe me...
- There's a date on the back.

723
00:47:07,578 --> 00:47:09,997
There's no way
that I can actually prove it to you.

724
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:11,874
1991.

725
00:47:12,499 --> 00:47:16,211
1991 sounds like the past, though,
it doesn't sound like the future.

726
00:47:16,253 --> 00:47:18,672
You know what?
There's a phone number here, too.

727
00:47:18,881 --> 00:47:20,007
Yeah?

728
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:23,343
So call it!

729
00:47:23,927 --> 00:47:28,849
I mean, if that's what you want to do, call it!
That's what it's for, for doubters like you.

730
00:47:30,475 --> 00:47:32,728
- You really want to know?
- I do want to know.

731
00:47:32,769 --> 00:47:36,023
Then call it! They'll tell you
everything you want to know.

732
00:47:36,648 --> 00:47:39,693
My dad'll tell you
how he works in a plastics factory...

733
00:47:39,776 --> 00:47:42,070
...and my mom drives a school bus.

734
00:47:42,112 --> 00:47:44,156
I was born in 1961, Dubuque.

735
00:47:44,239 --> 00:47:47,910
I was a breech birth. Backwards?
It's a little joke between back-travelers.

736
00:47:47,951 --> 00:47:52,748
They'll tell you that I was clumsy in school.
I was always falling off the jungle gym.

737
00:47:52,956 --> 00:47:55,209
How I had an overactive imagination.

738
00:47:55,292 --> 00:47:59,796
They'll tell you about the difficult years,
the black lights, the acid trips.

739
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:04,760
The fights about money
and responsibilities, proper hygiene!

740
00:48:06,637 --> 00:48:08,972
How I ran away when I was 23...

741
00:48:09,681 --> 00:48:12,434
...and they haven't heard from me since.

742
00:48:13,977 --> 00:48:15,604
You see, my story...

743
00:48:15,687 --> 00:48:17,940
...is a sad one.

744
00:48:19,024 --> 00:48:20,943
You want to know why?

745
00:48:21,985 --> 00:48:23,987
Because that's all I could afford.

746
00:48:27,407 --> 00:48:28,909
I don't want to see you anymore.

747
00:48:28,951 --> 00:48:31,703
Sit over here,
so that we're not facing each other.

748
00:48:33,288 --> 00:48:35,874
I don't want to see you in my life anymore.

749
00:48:36,416 --> 00:48:39,837
And the way that I see it,
it's freaks versus normal guys...

750
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:43,090
...and you have confirmed yourself
as a member of the former.

751
00:48:43,173 --> 00:48:45,384
- What's a freak?
- It's a weirdo!

752
00:48:45,467 --> 00:48:47,636
You are scamming me somehow.
I don't know how...

753
00:48:47,678 --> 00:48:49,638
...but I'm not sticking around to find out.

754
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:50,973
You call me a weirdo?

755
00:48:51,014 --> 00:48:55,018
I'm sorry it didn't work out, but my therapist
says that I have a fear of intimacy.

756
00:48:55,102 --> 00:48:58,272
- I am freak.
- I think it's best if I work it out on my own.

757
00:48:58,355 --> 00:49:02,150
Freak. I thought that was the dance
circa the 1970s. Weirdo, I know.

758
00:49:02,234 --> 00:49:04,486
That's what Blinovitch's detractors
called him...

759
00:49:04,528 --> 00:49:08,115
...when he discovered
how to bend space and time in 2278.

760
00:49:08,282 --> 00:49:10,284
Time-travel is a physical impossibility.

761
00:49:15,789 --> 00:49:18,917
You explain to me how
time-travel is possible.

762
00:49:19,001 --> 00:49:21,378
You tell me how
an internal-combustion engine works.

763
00:49:21,461 --> 00:49:24,798
You don't even know
how the basic quantum mechanics work.

764
00:49:27,134 --> 00:49:28,510
Sit down.

765
00:49:28,552 --> 00:49:30,095
- No!
- Sit down!

766
00:49:30,179 --> 00:49:32,598
You want to know how back-travel works?
Sit down.

767
00:49:32,681 --> 00:49:34,308
Okay. Let's hear.

768
00:49:36,935 --> 00:49:38,228
Give me your leg.

769
00:49:39,313 --> 00:49:41,857
- You want to know how back-travel works?
- Okay. Yes.

770
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:44,943
- You want to know how it works?
- I'm giving you my leg.

771
00:49:47,112 --> 00:49:50,365
Let's say that this is the passage of time.

772
00:49:53,285 --> 00:49:54,703
This is the present.

773
00:49:56,246 --> 00:49:57,998
And that...

774
00:49:59,875 --> 00:50:01,001
...is the past.

775
00:50:02,085 --> 00:50:03,545
It's a memory.

776
00:50:03,837 --> 00:50:05,839
The problem always was...

777
00:50:06,423 --> 00:50:08,592
...how to get from the present...

778
00:50:09,801 --> 00:50:13,222
...all the way back to the...

779
00:50:17,434 --> 00:50:19,228
You can't do it, right?

780
00:50:19,311 --> 00:50:21,647
Breaks all the fundamental laws of physics.

781
00:50:21,897 --> 00:50:23,482
It's impossible.

782
00:50:24,107 --> 00:50:25,484
It's impossible.

783
00:50:26,109 --> 00:50:28,403
But what if time isn't a rigid line?

784
00:50:33,784 --> 00:50:37,287
What if you could bend space and time...

785
00:50:38,914 --> 00:50:40,374
...so that the present...

786
00:50:42,751 --> 00:50:45,629
...lays side by side with the past?

787
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:48,841
Then you really wouldn't have to go
back at all.

788
00:50:48,924 --> 00:50:51,844
You'd just have to make a little leap.

789
00:50:52,302 --> 00:50:54,847
See, you go from here...

790
00:50:57,641 --> 00:50:59,101
...to there.

791
00:51:06,108 --> 00:51:08,986
<i>Maybe it was all about sex at first.</i>

792
00:51:09,236 --> 00:51:12,155
<i>Maybe I was just in denial, buying time...</i>

793
00:51:14,867 --> 00:51:16,743
<i>But I really did want it to work.</i>

794
00:51:16,827 --> 00:51:19,037
<i>It really did feel like a game.</i>

795
00:51:19,663 --> 00:51:23,542
<i>As long as it was just our little game...</i>

796
00:51:31,675 --> 00:51:34,469
So, why did the Gene Dupes ban it?

797
00:51:34,887 --> 00:51:36,305
Back-travel?

798
00:51:38,307 --> 00:51:43,270
Brain drain. Apparently, too many
Anachronists disappeared into the past.

799
00:51:43,353 --> 00:51:46,732
They banned it in 2467,
except for the terminally ill.

800
00:51:49,067 --> 00:51:51,778
That's fun isn't it? Playing along?

801
00:51:52,029 --> 00:51:55,157
Yeah. I mean, he's a freak,
but he tells a good story.

802
00:51:55,532 --> 00:51:56,825
I'll bet he does.

803
00:51:58,243 --> 00:51:59,578
What if he has?

804
00:51:59,661 --> 00:52:01,747
- Has what?
- Told someone else?

805
00:52:01,830 --> 00:52:04,625
Then I'd worry. But he hasn't.

806
00:52:04,708 --> 00:52:07,628
Don't worry. He couldn't.
That would spoil the fantasy.

807
00:52:07,711 --> 00:52:09,254
Trust me on this one. He couldn't.

808
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:11,673
Do you ever think about, like...

809
00:52:11,757 --> 00:52:13,759
...the big issues, you know?

810
00:52:14,301 --> 00:52:17,930
Like, where do we come from?
What are we here for?

811
00:52:19,014 --> 00:52:20,432
The big questions.

812
00:52:22,017 --> 00:52:24,853
Someday, Marko,
there won't be any big questions.

813
00:52:26,063 --> 00:52:27,397
Like UFOs.

814
00:52:28,899 --> 00:52:30,234
What are they?

815
00:52:30,734 --> 00:52:32,110
They're interstellar travelers.

816
00:52:32,194 --> 00:52:34,905
They come from a planet called Eenon
from the Sirus Galaxy.

817
00:52:34,988 --> 00:52:39,159
They stop here on Earth to fill up
their nitro-carbon engines, and then...

818
00:52:40,869 --> 00:52:42,079
Maybe.

819
00:52:43,664 --> 00:52:45,123
What about God?

820
00:52:45,916 --> 00:52:47,209
Is there a God?

821
00:52:47,459 --> 00:52:51,880
Surprisingly, yes. A Jesuit priest
found 102 of them using a telepathy scope.

822
00:52:52,172 --> 00:52:54,299
- Through a what?
- Telepathy scope.

823
00:52:54,383 --> 00:52:57,719
What's a telepathy scope, dude?

824
00:52:58,095 --> 00:53:02,391
You're all right, man. I like you.
I feel like I can talk to you.

825
00:53:02,474 --> 00:53:06,687
Gretchen, she's cool and everything,
but I don't know if it's gonna work out.

826
00:53:06,770 --> 00:53:08,772
She's not deep enough, you know?

827
00:53:08,856 --> 00:53:11,066
What about Ruby? Is she deep?

828
00:53:11,692 --> 00:53:13,402
What is this stuff?

829
00:53:20,868 --> 00:53:24,204
I just want to say how happy I am
that you guys are here.

830
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:27,165
- We're happy, too.
- Let's toast.

831
00:53:28,292 --> 00:53:30,127
To the future...

832
00:53:31,086 --> 00:53:32,379
All right.

833
00:53:32,963 --> 00:53:34,756
...of our relationships.

834
00:53:41,013 --> 00:53:43,682
- Good Merlot, Gretchen.
- Thanks.

835
00:53:43,765 --> 00:53:46,602
It's a Syrah, actually, from Brazil.

836
00:53:47,519 --> 00:53:51,440
Apparently, they are growing grapes
where the rain forests used to be.

837
00:53:52,232 --> 00:53:56,445
I think it's so tragic about the rain forests.
They're going so fast.

838
00:53:57,029 --> 00:54:00,240
Do you know that I read
that they will all be gone...

839
00:54:00,324 --> 00:54:02,910
...by the year 2467?

840
00:54:02,993 --> 00:54:04,369
Actually...

841
00:54:04,453 --> 00:54:06,788
Can you tell that story about that time...

842
00:54:06,872 --> 00:54:09,917
Can you imagine the world
without the rain forests?

843
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,919
- That's deep.
- 'Cause I often wonder...

844
00:54:12,002 --> 00:54:14,046
...just all of it, gone.

845
00:54:14,129 --> 00:54:15,088
That's deep.

846
00:54:15,172 --> 00:54:17,674
What do you think that world
would be like, Mark?

847
00:54:18,509 --> 00:54:20,010
That's real deep, baby.

848
00:54:20,511 --> 00:54:21,970
You're stoned.

849
00:54:22,721 --> 00:54:24,473
Ruby, what about you?

850
00:54:25,349 --> 00:54:30,270
I heard that the rain forests are doing just
fine and in no danger, thanks to Sting.

851
00:54:30,521 --> 00:54:31,647
How worthy of him.

852
00:54:35,526 --> 00:54:38,237
What do you think that world, that...

853
00:54:38,445 --> 00:54:40,656
...future world...

854
00:54:41,114 --> 00:54:44,826
...would be like?
Hypothetically speaking, of course.

855
00:54:52,167 --> 00:54:53,669
Lick my finger.

856
00:54:54,628 --> 00:54:58,340
Go ahead, lick it.
It's nothing weird. Come on, baby.

857
00:55:46,263 --> 00:55:49,099
And that's what the world would be like
in the future.

858
00:55:55,189 --> 00:55:57,065
You're fucking stoned!

859
00:55:59,318 --> 00:56:00,736
I am stoned.

860
00:56:04,114 --> 00:56:05,782
What did I tell you?

861
00:56:08,952 --> 00:56:12,164
<i>So what can I tell you?</i>
<i>I felt we made progress that weekend.</i>

862
00:56:12,247 --> 00:56:14,208
As long as I just played along...

863
00:56:14,291 --> 00:56:16,710
You mean, as long as you enabled him?

864
00:56:17,836 --> 00:56:18,837
Yes.

865
00:56:18,921 --> 00:56:19,880
But...

866
00:56:20,047 --> 00:56:23,926
...it enriched our relationship.
I know you don't approve, but...

867
00:56:24,635 --> 00:56:26,345
...by trusting him...

868
00:56:26,845 --> 00:56:30,098
...it allowed him to open up
in ways that he couldn't...

869
00:56:30,182 --> 00:56:31,725
...that he hadn't before.

870
00:56:31,808 --> 00:56:33,644
<i>That's when he told me about his sister.</i>

871
00:56:33,727 --> 00:56:36,063
She didn't fall out of a tree, did she?

872
00:56:36,146 --> 00:56:39,441
<i>Or at least the latest version</i>
<i>of his story about his sister.</i>

873
00:56:39,525 --> 00:56:43,570
No, all the trees were gone
after the Great Infestation. You know.

874
00:56:44,071 --> 00:56:47,074
- It's back-story. Remember?
- Yeah. I'm sorry.

875
00:56:47,157 --> 00:56:49,243
<i>He said she was down on the beach...</i>

876
00:56:54,414 --> 00:56:56,250
<i>She was by herself...</i>

877
00:57:01,713 --> 00:57:04,091
<i>He said she must have seen something...</i>

878
00:57:18,355 --> 00:57:21,149
Now, wait. Let's hang on a tick.

879
00:57:30,701 --> 00:57:33,370
- I asked him the same thing.
- Very good.

880
00:57:34,204 --> 00:57:35,497
What'd he say?

881
00:57:35,873 --> 00:57:38,792
Blinovitch's Second Law
of Temporal Inertia.

882
00:57:40,210 --> 00:57:41,211
Again?

883
00:57:41,545 --> 00:57:44,256
Blinovitch's Second Law
of Temporal Inertia.

884
00:57:44,339 --> 00:57:47,426
Basically, it's impossible to back-travel
in your own lifetime.

885
00:57:47,509 --> 00:57:49,428
You have to go way back...

886
00:57:49,553 --> 00:57:51,346
...to make any change at all.

887
00:57:51,388 --> 00:57:53,390
Even then, they have to be small changes...

888
00:57:53,473 --> 00:57:56,226
...so they dampen out
by the time it reaches the present.

889
00:57:56,310 --> 00:57:58,437
So, you really can't change anything?

890
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:01,148
It's just a theory,
and an unproven one as well.

891
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:04,193
If it's just a theory,
then you should change it.

892
00:58:04,610 --> 00:58:06,653
There is another theory, you know.

893
00:58:06,987 --> 00:58:09,907
That you can change the past.
That you can really change it.

894
00:58:10,115 --> 00:58:12,534
What theory is that?

895
00:58:12,826 --> 00:58:15,078
- Cheeseman's.
- Cheeseman's?

896
00:58:15,287 --> 00:58:17,956
Cheeseman's Emotional Energy Theory.
It's true.

897
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:22,002
Cheeseman believed if you can concentrate
enough energy in a moment in time...

898
00:58:22,085 --> 00:58:25,547
...then you could alter the past
and create a new future.

899
00:58:27,466 --> 00:58:30,093
What kind of energy? Nuclear?

900
00:58:30,427 --> 00:58:33,597
Emotional. Love energy. Hate energy.

901
00:58:34,056 --> 00:58:36,308
- It's very potent stuff, you know.
- Really?

902
00:58:36,391 --> 00:58:39,311
Cheeseman worked with fruit flies,
and then he realized...

903
00:58:41,563 --> 00:58:43,357
It was kind of low.

904
00:58:44,107 --> 00:58:47,694
But then he thought,
humans are creative, sensitive creatures.

905
00:58:47,778 --> 00:58:50,364
Maybe they could muster up
enough energy to actually...

906
00:58:50,405 --> 00:58:54,409
...break the causal chain,
alter the past and create a new future.

907
00:58:54,743 --> 00:58:58,747
- So then what happens to the old future?
- It'd be there. There'd be two futures.

908
00:58:58,830 --> 00:59:01,500
The one you left
and the one you're creating.

909
00:59:01,583 --> 00:59:05,045
They'd exist simultaneously,
parallel to each other.

910
00:59:06,255 --> 00:59:08,423
Not parallel universes.

911
00:59:08,507 --> 00:59:11,426
It's only a theory. It hasn't been proven...

912
00:59:12,052 --> 00:59:13,053
...yet.

913
00:59:16,974 --> 00:59:19,810
<i>After that,</i>
<i>I guess you could say we coasted.</i>

914
00:59:19,893 --> 00:59:22,813
If the Gene Dupes
defeated the Anachronists...

915
00:59:22,896 --> 00:59:25,691
<i>I learned about his past</i>
<i>by asking about my future.</i>

916
00:59:26,817 --> 00:59:31,822
<i>And Sam, he kept the relationship</i>
<i>interesting by keeping it mysterious.</i>

917
00:59:32,447 --> 00:59:36,493
Hi. Can I have the number
for Sunil Vipassana?

918
00:59:36,577 --> 00:59:38,412
I think it's in Queens.

919
00:59:38,871 --> 00:59:41,290
<i>What's a relationship</i>
<i>without mystery, right?</i>

920
00:59:41,373 --> 00:59:43,959
Okay. Somebody give me a verb.

921
00:59:44,084 --> 00:59:48,172
<i>So, for a while,</i>
<i>we just enjoyed each other and our game.</i>

922
00:59:52,551 --> 00:59:54,178
We can beat this thing.

923
00:59:54,261 --> 00:59:56,638
<i>And we took care of each other.</i>

924
00:59:56,722 --> 00:59:59,183
- I know we will.
- We'll do it together.

925
01:00:00,184 --> 01:00:02,227
Maybe you should see someone.

926
01:00:04,813 --> 01:00:06,648
I wasn't talking about me.

927
01:00:09,902 --> 01:00:12,321
<i>Maybe it could have gone on</i>
<i>like that forever.</i>

928
01:00:15,532 --> 01:00:17,034
<i>But it didn't.</i>

929
01:00:17,367 --> 01:00:18,869
Another cruise?

930
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:21,830
<i>It was just a matter of time</i>
<i>before something...</i>

931
01:00:40,057 --> 01:00:41,558
Oh, boy.

932
01:00:42,142 --> 01:00:43,560
And it was after that...

933
01:00:43,644 --> 01:00:45,896
...that I finally asked you for your help.

934
01:00:45,979 --> 01:00:48,982
I definitely think I should see him.

935
01:00:49,066 --> 01:00:50,859
Why? What do you mean?

936
01:00:51,193 --> 01:00:52,778
Have you ever heard of TLE?

937
01:00:53,529 --> 01:00:56,698
- TLE?
- Temporal Lobe Epilepsy.

938
01:00:57,241 --> 01:00:59,701
Don't worry, I mean,
this is not like grand mal.

939
01:00:59,785 --> 01:01:03,163
I mean, he doesn't fall to the ground
foaming at the mouth.

940
01:01:03,413 --> 01:01:06,416
These seizures are infinitely more subtle.

941
01:01:06,583 --> 01:01:10,003
Seizures? So, you think that his spells are...

942
01:01:10,087 --> 01:01:11,839
With TLE, it's more like...

943
01:01:12,089 --> 01:01:14,049
...intense attacks of emotion.

944
01:01:14,091 --> 01:01:18,136
Euphoria.
A heightened sense of smell and hearing.

945
01:01:18,220 --> 01:01:20,973
The distortion of time and space.
