Elizabeth.

2
00:01:10,303 --> 00:01:13,238
- How long was I out?
- About six minutes.

3
00:01:13,312 --> 00:01:14,457
Thanks.

4
00:01:15,007 --> 00:01:18,106
- OK. I'll be right there.
- OK, I'll be outside. Hey, Fran.

5
00:01:19,328 --> 00:01:20,921
What are you still doin' here?

6
00:01:20,992 --> 00:01:23,675
- How long you been on?
- Twenty-three.

7
00:01:23,743 --> 00:01:25,914
Twenty-three?
Time to go, Elizabeth.

8
00:01:25,984 --> 00:01:28,155
That's not gonna get me
an attending slot.

9
00:01:28,224 --> 00:01:31,224
Adams? She needs to know
how to redress her sutures,

10
00:01:31,296 --> 00:01:32,921
but then she can be discharged.

11
00:01:32,991 --> 00:01:36,155
No, no. Ellis needs an EKG.
I don't like these swollen ankles.

12
00:01:36,223 --> 00:01:37,303
- All right.
- Thanks.

13
00:01:37,376 --> 00:01:39,678
Hey. I took care of Trauma Two
while you slept.

14
00:01:39,744 --> 00:01:42,493
- I wasn't sleeping, I was just...
- You're welcome.

15
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,153
You're on in five and eight.

16
00:01:47,616 --> 00:01:49,721
Jenny? You seen Jenny?

17
00:01:49,792 --> 00:01:52,606
Sorry. Sorry. I'm here.

18
00:01:52,672 --> 00:01:54,876
Hi, Mr. Olarke.
I'm Dr. Masterson.

19
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:57,016
We're gonna need a OBO,
lytes and a UA.

20
00:01:57,087 --> 00:02:00,054
Anything I can do to make you
feel more comfortable today?

21
00:02:00,127 --> 00:02:02,396
- Marry me?
- Wow.

22
00:02:02,463 --> 00:02:04,700
No, I have my own bus pass.

23
00:02:04,767 --> 00:02:06,360
Well, then how could I refuse?

24
00:02:06,432 --> 00:02:10,207
Let me just call my sister and see if
I can borrow her dress. You sit tight.

25
00:02:10,272 --> 00:02:13,174
Keep an eye on my fiancê,
and decrease his morphine drip.

26
00:02:17,151 --> 00:02:18,493
Doin' OK?

27
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,996
Olear bed four.

28
00:02:27,423 --> 00:02:29,016
Sir, you wanna step over...

29
00:02:31,903 --> 00:02:34,358
I got it. I got it.

30
00:02:34,431 --> 00:02:35,708
I got it.

31
00:02:37,727 --> 00:02:39,832
- I was just about to...
- You're welcome.

32
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,647
Thank you.

33
00:02:55,551 --> 00:02:58,518
UTI progressing into infection.
Pneumonia. Diabetic coma.

34
00:02:58,591 --> 00:03:00,566
Una problema con sus riñones.

35
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,252
I'll have a Venti, triple-shot,
sugar-free, vanilla, nonfat cappuccino.

36
00:03:06,431 --> 00:03:08,439
- Doctor.
- Mr. Olarke?

37
00:03:08,512 --> 00:03:09,821
Will you marry me?

38
00:03:09,888 --> 00:03:13,303
Of course, Mr. Olarke. But first,
we need to find you a robe. Jenny!

39
00:03:13,376 --> 00:03:15,448
Sorry. Sorry. I'm here.

40
00:03:16,383 --> 00:03:18,107
Going full Kabuki tonight, Fran?

41
00:03:18,176 --> 00:03:20,761
The dark circles
were scaring the patients.

42
00:03:20,831 --> 00:03:22,522
And she's got a hot date tonight.

43
00:03:22,591 --> 00:03:26,039
Stop! I'm going out to dinner
with my ex and his mother.

44
00:03:26,112 --> 00:03:28,217
He still hasn't told her
we're divorced.

45
00:03:28,287 --> 00:03:30,970
I won't be responsible for killing
an 80-year-old woman.

46
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:32,501
I'll trade nights with you.

47
00:03:32,576 --> 00:03:35,227
I've gotta go home and sew
six caterpillar costumes

48
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:37,434
with Velcro legs
for Katie's dance class.

49
00:03:37,503 --> 00:03:39,478
I don't know
how you guys do it.

50
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:43,164
Nick is totally pushing me for kids.
I don't have time to shave my legs.

51
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:45,752
- Stop shaving. He'll leave you alone.
- Really?

52
00:03:45,823 --> 00:03:49,336
Elizabeth, you're so lucky that all
you have to worry about is work.

53
00:03:57,024 --> 00:04:00,090
- Dr. Masterson, are you in there?
- Yeah, I'll be right out.

54
00:04:01,728 --> 00:04:03,997
- Ankle in bed two.
- OK, there's no fracture.

55
00:04:04,063 --> 00:04:06,932
Just wrap it up
and send him home. Thanks.

56
00:04:07,007 --> 00:04:08,665
- Hello?
- Are you really coming?

57
00:04:08,735 --> 00:04:09,815
Yes, I'm coming.

58
00:04:09,887 --> 00:04:11,992
Good. Because this guy is great.

59
00:04:12,063 --> 00:04:13,722
You met him? Is he there?

60
00:04:13,792 --> 00:04:15,995
I haven't actually
met him in person.

61
00:04:16,064 --> 00:04:18,300
Abby, you're not setting me up
with a stranger.

62
00:04:18,367 --> 00:04:21,018
He's a friend of an old friend.
He's really nice.

63
00:04:21,087 --> 00:04:23,837
What does that mean,
fat with a good sense of humor?

64
00:04:23,904 --> 00:04:24,984
Not again, Abby.

65
00:04:25,055 --> 00:04:26,965
It wasn't easy
to get this guy to come.

66
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,520
He doesn't do this kind of thing either.
Do you girls have to do that here?

67
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:33,242
Do we not have six other rooms
in the house? Help Mommy.

68
00:04:33,312 --> 00:04:36,159
I'm in the seventh circle of hell,
you better show up.

69
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:38,012
I'll be there.
I'm just really busy.

70
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:40,927
Don't you dare. You don't know
the meaning of the word.

71
00:04:40,992 --> 00:04:44,440
I'm doin' you this huge favor here.
Beggars can't be choosers.

72
00:04:44,512 --> 00:04:47,032
I am completely capable
of meeting men on my own.

73
00:04:48,512 --> 00:04:51,414
I know, honey. I'd just like you
to meet one who's not bleeding.

74
00:04:51,488 --> 00:04:54,357
I've already had
two marriage proposals today.

75
00:04:54,432 --> 00:04:55,893
- Marry me.
- Yes, Mr. Olarke.

76
00:04:55,967 --> 00:04:57,658
Yes, of course.
Make that three.

77
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:59,516
- I'll see ya at seven.
- It is seven.

78
00:04:59,584 --> 00:05:01,820
Thirty. 7:30.
What are you making?

79
00:05:01,887 --> 00:05:04,473
Lasagna. Mom's recipe.
No carbohydrate comments.

80
00:05:04,543 --> 00:05:08,886
Please. I'm going on a day and a half
of cafeteria salad. Anything'll do.

81
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:10,869
Who put SpongeBob in the pasta?

82
00:05:10,944 --> 00:05:12,438
I gotta go.

83
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:13,886
So, what are you gonna do?

84
00:05:13,951 --> 00:05:16,122
The only other option is Phoenix.

85
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:18,777
- Would you consider it?
- Phoenix, San Francisco.

86
00:05:18,847 --> 00:05:22,971
Old people and melanomas versus
great sushi and desperate women.

87
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,152
Walsh likes you.

88
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:26,744
Dr. Walsh. Gunshot victim,
internal hemorrhaging.

89
00:05:27,455 --> 00:05:29,627
- How long have you been here?
- Twelve hours.

90
00:05:31,231 --> 00:05:32,508
A few more.

91
00:05:33,407 --> 00:05:35,960
- All right, Brett.
- I'll scrub up.

92
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:39,479
Elizabeth.

93
00:05:39,552 --> 00:05:41,079
Yes, sir.

94
00:05:41,151 --> 00:05:42,875
I was going to wait till tomorrow,

95
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:46,620
but I wanted to let you know
that I've made my decision.

96
00:05:46,687 --> 00:05:49,021
I want you to stay on
as an attending physician.

97
00:05:49,088 --> 00:05:50,876
Really? Thank you.

98
00:05:50,943 --> 00:05:52,634
- Hey. Hey.
- Thank you, Dr. Walsh.

99
00:05:52,703 --> 00:05:54,132
You've earned it.

100
00:05:54,207 --> 00:05:56,858
Unlike some others,
you spend more time being concerned

101
00:05:56,928 --> 00:05:59,415
with what's best for the patient
than kissing my ass.

102
00:05:59,487 --> 00:06:01,756
A risky move, but I like it.

103
00:06:01,824 --> 00:06:04,507
Sir, I can't thank you enough
for this opportunity.

104
00:06:04,575 --> 00:06:07,804
There's so much I want to do here.
I can't wait to get started.

105
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:09,693
- Elizabeth?
- Yes?

106
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:13,055
The only thing I need you
to do right now is go home.

107
00:06:13,119 --> 00:06:15,159
- But, sir, I... I have...
- Go.

108
00:06:15,231 --> 00:06:16,889
You've been here 26 hours.

109
00:06:17,983 --> 00:06:19,292
I know all.

110
00:06:35,551 --> 00:06:37,722
- Dr. Masterson.
- Yeah?

111
00:06:38,623 --> 00:06:41,044
I have a bowel obstruction in six.

112
00:06:41,119 --> 00:06:44,316
At least, I think that's what it is.
Can you take a quick peek?

113
00:06:45,024 --> 00:06:47,031
Yeah, of course.

114
00:06:52,127 --> 00:06:53,785
- Brett.
- Congratulations.

115
00:06:53,855 --> 00:06:56,124
Thank you. I didn't know
Walsh was gonna...

116
00:06:56,192 --> 00:06:58,330
I have an offer in Phoenix.
Life's good.

117
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:00,504
That's great. That's great.

118
00:07:00,575 --> 00:07:01,852
It's fine.

119
00:07:07,712 --> 00:07:09,086
- Hey, Abby, it's me.
- Hey.

120
00:07:09,151 --> 00:07:11,126
I'm sorry I'm late.
I know. I'm on my way.

121
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,877
- Don't worry. Your date's late too.
- Listen. I have good news.

122
00:07:14,944 --> 00:07:18,173
I got the attending position.
I'm staying in San Francisco.

123
00:07:18,239 --> 00:07:20,475
Oh, that's great!
Well, get over here.

124
00:07:20,543 --> 00:07:23,860
- We're breakin' out the champagne.
- I'll be there in a minute. Bye.

125
00:07:37,887 --> 00:07:39,861
This place is heaven.

126
00:07:43,711 --> 00:07:45,751
It's been photographed
for magazines.

127
00:07:48,447 --> 00:07:52,156
Yeah. I think I told you I was
gonna need something furnished.

128
00:07:52,223 --> 00:07:53,750
Well, it is furnished.

129
00:07:53,823 --> 00:07:55,678
Where's the couch?

130
00:08:00,095 --> 00:08:03,095
Do you believe all of this space?

131
00:08:03,167 --> 00:08:06,844
Yeah, it's great
for all those raves I'll be throwing.

132
00:08:10,783 --> 00:08:13,336
I'm... sensing a "no."

133
00:08:15,007 --> 00:08:16,284
Wow, huh?

134
00:08:17,183 --> 00:08:19,355
I know. This place
isn't usually available,

135
00:08:19,423 --> 00:08:23,067
but the couple's spending all their time
in Palm Springs now.

136
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:02,170
David, I'm just not quite sure
what you're looking for.

137
00:09:02,239 --> 00:09:04,628
Maybe if we could
communicate a little more.

138
00:09:04,703 --> 00:09:06,590
Maybe if you could
let me know a bit more

139
00:09:06,656 --> 00:09:10,332
about what's going on with you,
with your job, your family situation.

140
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,701
- I don't wanna talk about that.
- Here's an idea:

141
00:09:12,767 --> 00:09:16,379
Stop looking for a couple
of months. Start again.

142
00:09:16,447 --> 00:09:18,455
You've gotta know
where you wanna live.

143
00:09:18,527 --> 00:09:20,916
I just... I'm... I'm not...

144
00:09:20,991 --> 00:09:22,552
...getting what it is you...

145
00:09:24,415 --> 00:09:26,554
Hey, well... no. David.

146
00:09:26,623 --> 00:09:28,281
David, are you kidding?

147
00:09:28,351 --> 00:09:30,140
Wait, David. Look, come on.

148
00:09:30,207 --> 00:09:32,312
A place like this,
it is long gone by now.

149
00:09:32,383 --> 00:09:35,830
No, listen, there's 90 vultures
and just one carcass.

150
00:09:35,903 --> 00:09:39,002
All right, fine. I'll call them.

151
00:09:40,191 --> 00:09:43,006
He did? OK.

152
00:09:43,071 --> 00:09:45,308
Well, right.
As soon as I know.

153
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:47,480
Thank you so much for your help.

154
00:09:48,767 --> 00:09:51,517
Well, it's pretty obvious
why this hasn't rented.

155
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:54,452
There's no one-year lease.
It's a month-to-month sublet.

156
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:57,047
- Why?
- Some family matter.

157
00:09:57,119 --> 00:09:59,323
They were pretty
close-mouthed about it.

158
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,696
Wow, what a view.

159
00:10:15,775 --> 00:10:17,052
David.

160
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:21,596
Wow.

161
00:10:23,391 --> 00:10:26,904
This is... sensational.

162
00:10:28,031 --> 00:10:31,577
Oh, my God.
And it's got the private access?

163
00:10:31,647 --> 00:10:33,108
They didn't do much with it,

164
00:10:33,183 --> 00:10:37,274
but, I mean, you really
could do something with this.

165
00:10:37,343 --> 00:10:39,383
Isn't this gorgeous?

166
00:10:49,183 --> 00:10:53,012
Well, there's a few places
in the Richmond we haven't hit yet.

167
00:10:53,087 --> 00:10:54,429
I like the couch.

168
00:10:54,495 --> 00:10:55,771
The couch.

169
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,400
Good couch.

170
00:10:59,999 --> 00:11:01,275
Good couch.

171
00:11:20,991 --> 00:11:23,228
David. David, come here.

172
00:11:37,887 --> 00:11:40,920
- What? What?
- There's nothing worth stealing here.

173
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:44,024
- There's no money, no drugs.
- I'm not stealing anything.

174
00:11:44,095 --> 00:11:46,583
OK. I'm sure there's
a homeless shelter nearby.

175
00:11:46,655 --> 00:11:49,110
I will give you money
for cab fare and a good meal.

176
00:11:49,183 --> 00:11:51,322
But please, don't blow it
on more beer, OK?

177
00:11:51,391 --> 00:11:53,879
I am not homeless. I live here.

178
00:11:53,951 --> 00:11:57,399
OK. You can't live here,
because I live here.

179
00:11:57,471 --> 00:11:58,748
This is my apartment.

180
00:11:58,815 --> 00:12:01,270
- Since when?
- Since I rented it.

181
00:12:01,343 --> 00:12:02,652
- You rented it.
- Yeah.

182
00:12:02,719 --> 00:12:04,955
- You know what? I don't need this.
- What?

183
00:12:05,023 --> 00:12:07,478
- Rent scam, right?
- What are you talking about?

184
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:11,195
There's probably five other people
who paid deposits and got the keys.

185
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:13,434
- And moved in all their things?
- Yeah... What?

186
00:12:13,503 --> 00:12:15,838
This is my stuff. All of this.

187
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:18,074
That's my couch,
that's my coffee table.

188
00:12:18,143 --> 00:12:19,867
Is that a ring?

189
00:12:19,935 --> 00:12:21,593
Have you ever heard
of a coaster?

190
00:12:21,663 --> 00:12:23,386
Or a trash can, for that matter?

191
00:12:23,455 --> 00:12:27,481
I don't care who you are, you're gonna
mop that up. I'm getting the bucket.

192
00:12:27,551 --> 00:12:29,591
It's like a pig
moved into my house.

193
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,962
- What?
- Like a filthy pig.

194
00:12:32,031 --> 00:12:33,722
You... You moved in when?

195
00:12:45,727 --> 00:12:47,004
Hello?

196
00:13:12,735 --> 00:13:14,458
- I told you to get out.
- Jesus!

197
00:13:22,687 --> 00:13:25,589
OK. So, what's this all about?

198
00:13:25,662 --> 00:13:26,677
What? Nothin'.

199
00:13:26,751 --> 00:13:27,896
Nothin'.

200
00:13:27,967 --> 00:13:29,494
So, you called me for nothin'?

201
00:13:29,567 --> 00:13:31,934
I've been sort of
seeing someone.

202
00:13:31,999 --> 00:13:35,130
Seeing someone?
That's what I'm talkin' about. Finally.

203
00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:38,069
- You think it's a good thing?
- Absolutely.

204
00:13:38,142 --> 00:13:41,045
Yeah. The last time I tried
to hook you up, you bailed out.

205
00:13:41,119 --> 00:13:44,087
This is good, and the fact
that you initiated it yourself,

206
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:46,908
that's important. OK?
Now, who is she? Do I know her?

207
00:13:46,975 --> 00:13:49,277
I mean I'm seeing someone
that's not there.

208
00:13:49,343 --> 00:13:51,253
She's emotionally unavailable?

209
00:13:54,655 --> 00:13:57,176
You mean like a hallucination.

210
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:59,960
Twice, in my apartment.

211
00:14:00,031 --> 00:14:01,405
A woman.

212
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,518
Attractive?

213
00:14:03,487 --> 00:14:06,237
- Not really there, Jack.
- Right. Right. OK.

214
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:09,467
So when you saw this woman,
were you drunk?

215
00:14:10,847 --> 00:14:12,756
I mean, I had a little buzz.

216
00:14:12,831 --> 00:14:14,838
Dave, don't lie to me,
it doesn't help.

217
00:14:14,911 --> 00:14:16,569
OK, fine, I was wasted.

218
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,836
But still, I shouldn't be seeing
some little blonde control freak

219
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:21,463
running around my apartment.

220
00:14:21,535 --> 00:14:24,601
Why are you writing this down?
This isn't a session.

221
00:14:24,671 --> 00:14:29,406
That's insulting, OK? I'm your friend
Jack here, I'm not charging you.

222
00:14:29,471 --> 00:14:31,576
But if this thing rolls
into a second hour

223
00:14:31,646 --> 00:14:34,581
we're gonna have to work out
some kind of deal. I'm kidding.

224
00:14:34,655 --> 00:14:36,695
So, hold on a second.
You were drunk,

225
00:14:36,767 --> 00:14:39,800
- you saw this blonde, controlling...
- I gotta stop drinkin'.

226
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,497
- No.
- No?

227
00:14:41,567 --> 00:14:44,414
Yeah, drink, party.
Just do it with other people.

228
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:46,934
God gave us alcohol
as a social lubricant.

229
00:14:47,006 --> 00:14:49,308
Make men brave,
make women loose.

230
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:52,474
What is that,
some Berkeley shrink thing?

231
00:14:52,543 --> 00:14:54,103
No. Look around you, OK?

232
00:14:54,175 --> 00:14:57,023
See this? This is the world.

233
00:14:57,087 --> 00:14:58,265
Join it.

234
00:14:58,335 --> 00:15:00,277
Stop swimming around
in your own mind.

235
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:03,482
That is a dangerous neighborhood
you should not go into alone.

236
00:15:03,551 --> 00:15:06,682
Come on, Dave.
It's been two years, man.

237
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:08,344
No more hiding out.

238
00:15:09,663 --> 00:15:11,867
Absolutely not.

239
00:15:58,814 --> 00:16:01,848
- Are you insane? What are you doing?
- Oh, God, what is this?

240
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:04,058
I didn't want to,
but I will call the police.

241
00:16:04,127 --> 00:16:06,363
I'm sleeping. It's a dream.

242
00:16:06,431 --> 00:16:09,246
It's one of those dreams
and you know you're dreaming.

243
00:16:09,311 --> 00:16:12,246
- How do you keep getting in here?
- It's you who's in here.

244
00:16:12,319 --> 00:16:13,726
Oh, my.

245
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:15,733
This is more serious than I thought.

246
00:16:15,807 --> 00:16:17,181
Go away, you don't exist.

247
00:16:17,246 --> 00:16:19,286
I'm gonna ask you
a series of questions.

248
00:16:19,359 --> 00:16:21,050
I want you to answer honestly.

249
00:16:21,119 --> 00:16:23,737
Has your recent
alcohol consumption increased?

250
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:25,367
Yeah, so?

251
00:16:25,438 --> 00:16:29,181
Are you hearing voices or seeing
things that aren't quite real to you?

252
00:16:29,247 --> 00:16:31,102
As a matter of fact, yeah.

253
00:16:31,167 --> 00:16:34,778
Have you recently sought consult
from a mental health care professional?

254
00:16:34,847 --> 00:16:36,854
What? How do you know?
Stay away from me.

255
00:16:36,927 --> 00:16:39,348
Do you feel paranoid,
like people are out to get you?

256
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:41,179
Why are you asking
so many questions?

257
00:16:41,246 --> 00:16:44,443
I'll take that as a "Yes".
Listen to me.

258
00:16:44,511 --> 00:16:47,260
You have fantasized,
quite convincingly,

259
00:16:47,327 --> 00:16:51,483
that you've rented an apartment that,
in fact, belongs to somebody else.

260
00:16:51,551 --> 00:16:53,656
Pick up that pillow.

261
00:16:53,726 --> 00:16:55,766
Pick it up. It's OK.

262
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,726
There's a small red stain
on the back

263
00:16:57,791 --> 00:17:00,060
where I once spilled
cherry cough syrup.

264
00:17:00,127 --> 00:17:03,062
Yes, that's it.
How else would I know that?

265
00:17:03,134 --> 00:17:06,844
Or the fact that these sheets that
you're now soiling are from Nordstrom.

266
00:17:06,911 --> 00:17:09,213
I still have the receipt,
it's in that drawer.

267
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:10,937
Open it up and check.

268
00:17:11,966 --> 00:17:14,268
I think you need to
come to terms with the fact

269
00:17:14,335 --> 00:17:15,928
that you may be mentally ill.

270
00:17:17,471 --> 00:17:19,064
- Really?
- Yes.

271
00:17:20,031 --> 00:17:22,452
This is my apartment.
These are my sheets.

272
00:17:22,526 --> 00:17:25,079
That's my nightstand.
That's my picture...

273
00:17:27,326 --> 00:17:29,660
- Where's my picture?
- What picture?

274
00:17:29,727 --> 00:17:32,444
There was a picture there of my...

275
00:17:32,511 --> 00:17:35,642
There was a picture
right there on the nightstand.

276
00:17:35,711 --> 00:17:38,526
- That was empty when I moved in.
- It was just there.

277
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:41,591
You know what? I've had enough.
I am calling the police.

278
00:17:41,663 --> 00:17:43,638
- No, no, no, no.
- It's too late.

279
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:48,445
What'd you do to my phone?

280
00:17:50,751 --> 00:17:52,158
Why can't I...?

281
00:17:55,295 --> 00:17:56,505
You stay right there.

282
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,484
I'm gonna use the one in the kitchen.

283
00:18:05,567 --> 00:18:07,356
Hey, Grace,
David Abbott here.

284
00:18:07,423 --> 00:18:09,561
The people who sublet
this apartment to me,

285
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,997
- do you have their number?
- Is something wrong?

286
00:18:12,063 --> 00:18:16,121
No, no. I was just wondering
about the previous tenant, that's all.

287
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:19,965
Well, the woman that I dealt with,
she didn't want to talk about it.

288
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:22,169
It was some kind of
tragedy in the family.

289
00:18:22,239 --> 00:18:25,272
I didn't press for details
'cause I don't need any more drama.

290
00:18:25,342 --> 00:18:28,638
- You think this girl died?
- Well, you better hope so.

291
00:18:28,703 --> 00:18:30,907
That's the only way
they're gonna get off

292
00:18:30,975 --> 00:18:33,692
this month-to-month thing
and give you a real lease.

293
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:36,923
- That's not exactly the reason I was...
- Come on, David, grow up.

294
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:38,878
Look, it has a view, a fireplace.

295
00:18:38,942 --> 00:18:42,455
People would kill their grandmothers
for a lot less in this city.

296
00:19:12,542 --> 00:19:14,517
- Can I help you with anything?
- No.

297
00:19:14,591 --> 00:19:18,169
I mean, do you believe in this stuff?

298
00:19:18,238 --> 00:19:21,053
Well, you don't until you do.

299
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:22,907
That's a little dated.

300
00:19:22,975 --> 00:19:26,423
I recommend the Rosemary Preston.
It's totally seminal.

301
00:19:26,495 --> 00:19:29,244
'Scuse me.
Where's your UFO section?

302
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:31,099
It's back and to the left.

303
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:34,363
Ufology. It's not even
a real science.

304
00:19:34,431 --> 00:19:36,635
So, what kind of encounter
have you had?

305
00:19:36,703 --> 00:19:38,972
- Encounter?
- Ectoplasm?

306
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,948
Soniferous ether?

307
00:19:41,022 --> 00:19:44,405
I have a killer sêance book
if you're into communication.

308
00:19:44,478 --> 00:19:46,584
Communicating is not her problem.

309
00:19:47,615 --> 00:19:50,811
Righteous.
I have exactly what you need.

310
00:19:56,511 --> 00:19:57,656
Yeah.

311
00:20:00,863 --> 00:20:02,139
Crap!

312
00:20:04,638 --> 00:20:05,587
There.

313
00:20:07,198 --> 00:20:09,435
"Spirit, awake.

314
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:12,509
Spirit, partake.

315
00:20:12,575 --> 00:20:15,422
Spirit, without fear.

316
00:20:15,486 --> 00:20:18,039
Spirit, appear."

317
00:20:22,366 --> 00:20:24,025
Are... are you here?

318
00:20:26,462 --> 00:20:28,023
Come on, I think you're here.

319
00:20:32,478 --> 00:20:33,940
OK.

320
00:20:34,015 --> 00:20:36,830
I've got a hot, moist
cup of coffee in my hand.

321
00:20:36,895 --> 00:20:39,383
There is no coaster on this table.

322
00:20:39,455 --> 00:20:42,935
I'm going to set it down
on this lovely mahogany...

323
00:20:43,007 --> 00:20:44,501
Don't you dare!

324
00:20:45,342 --> 00:20:47,033
We... We need to talk.

325
00:20:47,103 --> 00:20:48,118
About what?

326
00:20:50,591 --> 00:20:54,453
Has it crossed your mind that there
might be something a little off

327
00:20:54,527 --> 00:20:57,244
about the way you've
been spending your days?

328
00:20:57,311 --> 00:21:00,693
Actually, yes. It's weird having
a squatter in your living room.

329
00:21:00,766 --> 00:21:02,228
I am not...

330
00:21:03,806 --> 00:21:05,017
OK, let's start over.

331
00:21:05,087 --> 00:21:06,909
Hi, I'm David Abbott.

332
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,796
And you are...?

333
00:21:08,863 --> 00:21:10,870
I am...

334
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:15,478
I'm Elizabeth.
My name is Elizabeth.

335
00:21:15,551 --> 00:21:18,453
You didn't know that.
You... you had to read that.

336
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:20,916
I think I know my own name.

337
00:21:20,991 --> 00:21:24,187
OK. When was the last time
that you remember

338
00:21:24,254 --> 00:21:26,971
actually talking to someone
other than me?

339
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:29,373
The other day. The other day.

340
00:21:29,439 --> 00:21:31,992
And... And when you're not here,

341
00:21:32,063 --> 00:21:35,194
what do you do
with the rest of your day?

342
00:21:35,262 --> 00:21:38,044
Certainly a lot more
than you do, that's for sure.

343
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:40,150
Let's not stray from the point, Lizzie.

344
00:21:40,222 --> 00:21:42,524
Don't call me Lizzie.
I'm not in kindergarten.

345
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:45,143
- My name's Elizabeth.
- You think. Let me ask you,

346
00:21:45,214 --> 00:21:47,931
has anything dramatic
happened to you recently?

347
00:21:47,998 --> 00:21:49,143
Like what?

348
00:21:49,214 --> 00:21:51,636
I don't know, like dying maybe?

349
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,052
How dare you say that to me?

350
00:21:53,118 --> 00:21:54,263
OK, calm down.

351
00:21:54,334 --> 00:21:56,701
Get your hands off of me, you pervert!

352
00:21:56,767 --> 00:21:59,254
Calm down. I'm not...
I'm not here to hurt you.

353
00:21:59,326 --> 00:22:01,563
I'm trying to help you
face the fact that...

354
00:22:01,631 --> 00:22:03,289
- I'm not dead.
- Look around you.

355
00:22:03,358 --> 00:22:04,885
There should be a bright light.

356
00:22:04,959 --> 00:22:07,479
- There's no light.
- Walk into the light, Elizabeth!

357
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:11,576
There is no light! I am not dead!
I think I would know if I was dead!

358
00:22:16,479 --> 00:22:17,973
What's happening to me?

359
00:22:18,047 --> 00:22:19,257
You're dead!

360
00:22:19,326 --> 00:22:21,333
Stop saying that!

361
00:22:21,406 --> 00:22:22,683
Missed.

362
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:27,318
OK. OK, that's enough.
That's enough.

363
00:22:27,391 --> 00:22:29,878
You're just giving me a headache!
Get off of me!

364
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:31,259
OK. All right, all right.

365
00:22:31,327 --> 00:22:33,498
It's not my fault
you're the way you are.

366
00:22:33,566 --> 00:22:35,933
- I just want you out of my house.
- You get out!

367
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:41,365
Rest in peace.

368
00:22:41,439 --> 00:22:42,584
I'm not leaving.

369
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:00,117
Another one, my, my.

370
00:23:01,662 --> 00:23:03,604
Golden State playing very well...

371
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,428
I love ya
Tomorrow

372
00:23:06,495 --> 00:23:10,357
You're only a day away

373
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:13,398
Tomorrow, tomorrow

374
00:23:13,471 --> 00:23:16,253
I love ya
Tomorrow

375
00:23:16,318 --> 00:23:20,573
You're only a day away

376
00:23:20,638 --> 00:23:21,915
Fine!

377
00:23:23,486 --> 00:23:26,999
The sun'll come out
Tomorrow

378
00:23:27,071 --> 00:23:29,886
Bet your bottom dollar that tomorrow

379
00:23:29,951 --> 00:23:32,220
You know what? That's it.
I've had it with you.

380
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:34,937
I've tried to be nice,
but now you're outta here!

381
00:23:35,006 --> 00:23:37,242
The power of Christ compels you!

382
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:39,994
The power of Christ compels you!

383
00:23:40,062 --> 00:23:42,615
The power of Christ compels you!

384
00:23:42,686 --> 00:23:45,817
The power of Christ compels you!

385
00:23:45,886 --> 00:23:47,577
He can't even see me.

386
00:23:47,646 --> 00:23:48,856
A little more left.

387
00:23:48,926 --> 00:23:51,512
- You're mopping that up.
- More, more.

388
00:23:59,455 --> 00:24:01,691
They're gonna set off
the smoke detector.

389
00:24:08,478 --> 00:24:10,388
Dad, we got it!

390
00:24:17,054 --> 00:24:20,698
All set, sir. We have the spirit.

391
00:24:20,766 --> 00:24:21,944
A butter dish.

392
00:24:22,495 --> 00:24:24,698
- You sure?
- Oh, definitely.

393
00:24:24,767 --> 00:24:26,490
I have him right here.

394
00:24:26,558 --> 00:24:28,118
I'm gonna go give him a flush.

395
00:24:33,566 --> 00:24:34,646
That's it?

396
00:24:34,719 --> 00:24:36,125
You just sit there?

397
00:24:36,191 --> 00:24:39,736
Hey, you want bells and whistles
or a reading?

398
00:24:39,806 --> 00:24:41,748
Come on.
He can't see me, either.

399
00:24:41,822 --> 00:24:45,717
- For some hideous reason, only you can.
- OK, there's somethin'.

400
00:24:45,791 --> 00:24:47,678
Definitely a presence.

401
00:24:47,742 --> 00:24:50,077
How original. Tell me more.

402
00:24:50,142 --> 00:24:51,997
It's hostile.

403
00:24:52,062 --> 00:24:53,556
Wants you outta here.

404
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:55,255
Actually, he's not bad.

405
00:24:55,326 --> 00:24:56,755
You should move, dude.

406
00:24:57,950 --> 00:24:59,357
- I should move?
- I would.

407
00:24:59,422 --> 00:25:00,732
I like him.

408
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,325
No, I'm not gonna move.

409
00:25:02,398 --> 00:25:03,707
Can't you feel that, man?

410
00:25:03,775 --> 00:25:06,492
There's like this
cancer-causing ray of spirit hate

411
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:09,493
- searing right towards your body.
- This kid's got a gift.

412
00:25:09,566 --> 00:25:11,508
- I'm not moving!
- Why not?

413
00:25:11,582 --> 00:25:13,884
It's not like it's that great
an apartment.

414
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:15,160
- What?
- Yes, it is.

415
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:17,085
- It's got a view.
- And a fireplace.

416
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:18,198
Whatever, dude.

417
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:20,637
Yo, do you have,
like, a diet anything?

418
00:25:20,703 --> 00:25:23,190
I'm, like, 99.9 percent
parched here.

419
00:25:23,262 --> 00:25:24,920
Could really use a cola.

420
00:25:26,494 --> 00:25:27,639
Yeah. Come on.

421
00:25:36,671 --> 00:25:39,420
Move out?
That... that can't be it.

422
00:25:39,486 --> 00:25:42,203
Could you talk to her
and tell her she should pass on?

423
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:44,093
"Could you please talk to her?"

424
00:25:44,158 --> 00:25:46,132
- I'm ignoring you.
- I'm ignoring you.

425
00:25:46,206 --> 00:25:49,523
She won't accept that she's dead.
I told her to walk to the light.

426
00:25:49,598 --> 00:25:50,613
She wouldn't do it.

427
00:25:50,686 --> 00:25:53,817
That's because there is no light.
God, you're infuriating!

428
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:55,413
Wait, what's goin' on?

429
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:59,575
You know what?
Do you think I like this?

430
00:25:59,646 --> 00:26:01,272
Do you think this is easy for me?

431
00:26:01,342 --> 00:26:04,157
I know something's different,
something is not right.

432
00:26:04,222 --> 00:26:06,164
- I'm walking through walls.
- You know,

433
00:26:06,238 --> 00:26:07,699
I don't think I can help you.

434
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:10,873
This is one of the most
alive spirits I've ever been around.

435
00:26:10,942 --> 00:26:13,178
- She's not goin' anywhere.
- What do you mean?

436
00:26:13,246 --> 00:26:16,476
I agree with her, dude.
She's not dead.

437
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:21,623
But you, whoa.

438
00:26:21,694 --> 00:26:24,247
You gotta deal with this...

439
00:26:28,126 --> 00:26:31,508
'Cause seriously, that's like
the darkest aura I've ever seen.

440
00:26:31,582 --> 00:26:34,997
Suckin' the life right outta you.
It's killin' you, man.

441
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:37,499
You have to let her go, dude.

442
00:26:37,566 --> 00:26:40,435
How can I, when she won't leave?

443
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:42,201
Not your spirit girl.

444
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:44,157
I'm talkin' 'bout the other one.

445
00:26:44,222 --> 00:26:46,197
The one you're keepin' in here.

446
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:48,604
That's what's really
haunting you, isn't it?

447
00:26:49,438 --> 00:26:52,187
- I don't want to talk about that.
- I get it.

448
00:26:52,254 --> 00:26:53,716
You were dumped.

449
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:57,019
Probably for some guy who doesn't
have a couch fused to his ass.

450
00:26:57,086 --> 00:26:58,035
Shut up!

451
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:59,998
You can dish it out
but you can't take it?

452
00:27:00,062 --> 00:27:03,837
You bring Father Flanagan
and the Joy Luck Club to get rid of me.

453
00:27:03,902 --> 00:27:05,942
But I talk about you
getting dumped once...

454
00:27:06,014 --> 00:27:09,462
You don't know what the hell
you're talking about. Shut the hell up!

455
00:27:09,534 --> 00:27:11,509
Sorry for your loss, bro.

456
00:27:14,718 --> 00:27:16,573
A word to the wise, girl.

457
00:27:16,638 --> 00:27:18,743
Show some respect for the dead.

458
00:27:27,902 --> 00:27:28,982
David?

459
00:27:31,934 --> 00:27:33,527
I'm sorry.

460
00:27:36,414 --> 00:27:38,902
It occurred to me now that I...

461
00:27:38,974 --> 00:27:41,211
...probably don't know you
all that well.

462
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:46,458
I got this place for the roof.

463
00:27:48,574 --> 00:27:50,516
I was gonna do
a whole garden out here...

464
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:53,754
...eventually, I think.

465
00:27:53,822 --> 00:27:55,545
Now I'm babbling.

466
00:27:55,614 --> 00:27:57,021
I...

467
00:27:58,174 --> 00:27:59,451
I'm really sorry.

468
00:28:01,182 --> 00:28:05,011
Most people who deal with loss really
find it helpful to talk about things.

469
00:28:05,086 --> 00:28:07,191
I don't want to talk about it!

470
00:28:07,262 --> 00:28:09,171
Anger works too.

471
00:28:12,318 --> 00:28:13,660
Who was he talking about?

472
00:28:13,726 --> 00:28:15,897
Laura. Her name was Laura.

473
00:28:15,966 --> 00:28:17,821
Who's Laura?

474
00:28:17,886 --> 00:28:19,642
She was my wife.

475
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:28,116
What do you think I am, stupid?

476
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:30,743
What is this? Oh, come on.

477
00:28:35,582 --> 00:28:38,038
Don't. This is not gonna help.

478
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:40,794
How would you know? Have
you ever been in a bar in your life?

479
00:28:47,518 --> 00:28:49,427
The groundhog emerges!

480
00:28:49,502 --> 00:28:52,317
I didn't think you'd make it.
All right! All right!

481
00:28:52,382 --> 00:28:55,131
It's Jeff, Jody, Kim, Valerie.

482
00:28:55,198 --> 00:28:56,474
This is my buddy, Dave.

483
00:28:56,542 --> 00:28:58,517
- Nice to meet you.
- What are you drinkin'?

484
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:00,051
- Coffee.
- Scotch!

485
00:29:00,126 --> 00:29:01,915
- Don't you dare!
- Make it a double!

486
00:29:01,982 --> 00:29:05,048
You don't have to wait.
I can start the hangover right now.

487
00:29:06,398 --> 00:29:08,700
Yeah. Yeah.

488
00:29:08,766 --> 00:29:10,773
He's excited to be out. I know!

489
00:29:10,846 --> 00:29:11,926
Friday night!

490
00:29:11,998 --> 00:29:14,453
- You can't drink these feelings away.
- Watch me.

491
00:29:16,734 --> 00:29:18,010
So, you OK?

492
00:29:18,078 --> 00:29:21,242
Say goodbye, walk to the door,
let's get some food in your stomach.

493
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:22,969
Who made you my mother?

494
00:29:24,126 --> 00:29:25,403
Did I...?

495
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:27,891
How you comin' along
with those hallucinations?

496
00:29:27,966 --> 00:29:30,355
- That was nothing.
- You're not a well man, David.

497
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:33,594
- It's just a lack of sleep.
- Sleep? You gettin' any?

498
00:29:33,662 --> 00:29:35,287
- Eight hours.
- Twelve.

499
00:29:35,358 --> 00:29:38,457
- Nine, tops.
- Opium addicts are more alert than you.

500
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:40,948
- Will you knock it off.
- Don't you dare!

501
00:29:41,022 --> 00:29:42,516
Don't!

502
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:43,572
Last chance.

503
00:29:43,645 --> 00:29:45,653
What are you gonna do about it?

504
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:57,557
Dave, buddy!

505
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:05,179
I'm so...

506
00:30:06,558 --> 00:30:08,216
I'm sorry. God!

507
00:30:08,286 --> 00:30:10,653
- You freak!
- Dave, that is uncool, man!

508
00:30:16,798 --> 00:30:17,877
Good God!

509
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:20,055
You're gonna thank me
for that one day.

510
00:30:20,125 --> 00:30:23,704
For what? Making me look like a lunatic
in front of all those people?

511
00:30:36,445 --> 00:30:38,234
Why are you still here?

512
00:30:39,134 --> 00:30:42,614
That's a scary question.
I have no idea.

513
00:30:42,686 --> 00:30:44,377
Why are you the only one
that can see me?

514
00:30:44,446 --> 00:30:45,722
Don't ask me.

515
00:30:46,814 --> 00:30:50,905
All I know is when I'm not with you,
it's like I don't... exist.

516
00:30:52,669 --> 00:30:54,360
Oh, my God.

517
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:56,023
Maybe I am dead.

518
00:30:59,102 --> 00:31:00,695
Oh, come on now.

519
00:31:02,621 --> 00:31:04,727
I'm... I'm sorry
that I said you're dead.

520
00:31:04,797 --> 00:31:06,204
Maybe you're not dead.

521
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:08,953
Maybe you're just very... light.

522
00:31:10,686 --> 00:31:14,134
If I could just remember something
about who I am, or was.

523
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:16,344
I mean, then I'd know
once and for all.

524
00:31:19,358 --> 00:31:21,180
I'm trying to figure it out. I...

525
00:31:21,246 --> 00:31:23,035
I just can't do it by myself.

526
00:31:26,365 --> 00:31:29,267
You're not asking me to...
to help you, are you?

527
00:31:29,342 --> 00:31:30,684
Look.

528
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:32,725
You have two realities
to choose from.

529
00:31:32,798 --> 00:31:35,383
First one being that a woman
has come into your life

530
00:31:35,454 --> 00:31:38,869
in a very unconventional way
and she happens to need your assistance.

531
00:31:38,942 --> 00:31:40,317
Right.

532
00:31:40,382 --> 00:31:42,869
The second one is that
you're an insane person,

533
00:31:42,941 --> 00:31:45,145
sitting on a park bench
talking to yourself.

534
00:31:47,166 --> 00:31:49,108
I think I prefer the first one.

535
00:31:49,182 --> 00:31:50,840
OK.

536
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:52,284
Let's find out who I am.

537
00:31:57,822 --> 00:32:00,921
No. I think that apartment was vacant.

538
00:32:01,342 --> 00:32:02,618
That was a woman?

539
00:32:04,126 --> 00:32:05,587
Nobody live there.

540
00:32:05,662 --> 00:32:07,996
It's like I was a ghost
before I was dead.

541
00:32:10,238 --> 00:32:12,277
Hi. Can I help you?

542
00:32:12,349 --> 00:32:14,935
Finally, somebody normal.
I bet we were friends.

543
00:32:15,006 --> 00:32:17,395
Hi, I'm... I'm David.
I am a new tenant here.

544
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:19,771
Hi, David, Katrina.
Come on in.

545
00:32:19,838 --> 00:32:22,772
- She's friendly, I like her.
- This'll just take a sec.

546
00:32:22,846 --> 00:32:26,556
I have a question. The apartment
upstairs, it belonged to a young woman.

547
00:32:26,622 --> 00:32:28,826
Yeah, I think there
was somebody up there.

548
00:32:28,894 --> 00:32:30,966
But she was, like, totally antisocial.

549
00:32:31,038 --> 00:32:33,209
OK, maybe we weren't close friends.

550
00:32:33,278 --> 00:32:36,311
Kind a like a cat lady,
but without any cats.

551
00:32:36,382 --> 00:32:37,724
Right?

552
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:39,895
OK, I think we're done here. Let's go.

553
00:32:39,966 --> 00:32:42,268
- OK, thank you.
- Look. This is so retro,

554
00:32:42,334 --> 00:32:44,570
but I've got a window
I can't get open.

555
00:32:44,637 --> 00:32:46,361
- She's got to be kidding.
- What?

556
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:47,412
- What?
- What?

557
00:32:47,486 --> 00:32:49,242
She wants you to come in.

558
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:50,771
Well, if it's painted shut

559
00:32:50,845 --> 00:32:53,529
and you use a screwdriver
to jam it, it sometimes...

560
00:32:53,598 --> 00:32:55,005
Oh, tried it.

561
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:56,597
Won't budge.

562
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:59,517
No preliminaries. Incredible.

563
00:32:59,582 --> 00:33:02,332
I'd like to help,
but I have dinner plans.

564
00:33:02,398 --> 00:33:04,373
Well, I got dessert.

565
00:33:04,445 --> 00:33:06,006
I just threw up in my mouth.

566
00:33:06,078 --> 00:33:08,499
Well, OK. I...

567
00:33:10,174 --> 00:33:11,122
Nice to meet you.

568
00:33:11,198 --> 00:33:12,605
- You too, Dave.
- Thanks.

569
00:33:14,206 --> 00:33:16,213
Why is she wearing workout clothes?

570
00:33:16,286 --> 00:33:18,871
If you were gonna work out
in the middle of the day,

571
00:33:18,941 --> 00:33:22,683
the only reason to wear workout clothes,
do you really need a push-up bra?

572
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,473
The whole point's
to strap 'em down.

573
00:33:24,542 --> 00:33:28,055
- You're not comin' with me anymore.
- Why? Something might jog my memory.

574
00:33:28,126 --> 00:33:32,283
Too bad. You're like an AM radio someone
shoved in my head and I can't turn off.

575
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:35,928
You don't think she was
completely un-classy and predatory?

576
00:33:35,998 --> 00:33:38,387
Those happen to be
two of men's favorite things.

577
00:33:38,462 --> 00:33:41,396
- Why don't you just date a pit bull?
- Maybe I will.

578
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:43,325
- Damn it!
- What?

579
00:33:44,413 --> 00:33:46,323
I locked my key in the apartment.

580
00:33:46,398 --> 00:33:49,016
There's a spare key
under the fire extinguisher.

581
00:33:49,086 --> 00:33:53,047
I mean, I guess she's sexy if you're
into that whole tall, big boobs,

582
00:33:53,118 --> 00:33:55,256
long legs, model-y sorta thing.

583
00:33:55,325 --> 00:33:57,430
I guess if you wanna be that guy.

584
00:33:57,501 --> 00:33:59,160
There are five other units here,

585
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:02,077
and not one person even
remembers what you look like.

586
00:34:02,141 --> 00:34:03,897
Talk about being disconnected.

587
00:34:03,965 --> 00:34:07,413
- Are you sure you really want that?
- Yes, I'm sure.

588
00:34:08,669 --> 00:34:10,328
Next drawer on the left.

589
00:34:12,957 --> 00:34:15,445
There's a funnel in there too,
if you need it.

590
00:34:18,142 --> 00:34:20,182
- Check it out.
- What is it?

591
00:34:20,254 --> 00:34:21,334
New leads.

592
00:34:21,405 --> 00:34:23,577
Look, there's an address
written on here.

593
00:34:23,646 --> 00:34:26,134
I can't make that out.
Is that a five or a six?

594
00:34:26,205 --> 00:34:27,667
I think it's a...

595
00:34:27,742 --> 00:34:30,076
No, no, no, that's a five.
Definitely a five.

596
00:34:30,141 --> 00:34:33,589
So we have an address, a dry cleaning
ticket and a book of matches.

597
00:34:33,662 --> 00:34:35,004
You know what that means?

598
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:38,234
- We could start a very small fire?
- There's still hope.

599
00:34:38,302 --> 00:34:41,269
Oh, yes, these pants were jet black.

600
00:34:41,342 --> 00:34:42,455
Armani, I believe.

601
00:34:42,525 --> 00:34:44,500
I remember them.
They were expensive.

602
00:34:44,574 --> 00:34:47,607
Do you remember anything else
about the woman? It's important.

603
00:34:47,677 --> 00:34:50,012
She's pleasant,
but a little dull maybe.

604
00:34:50,078 --> 00:34:51,223
- Dull?
- Dull?

605
00:34:51,294 --> 00:34:55,036
I think of her,
I think of sadness, loneliness.

606
00:34:55,101 --> 00:34:57,752
I don't need a psychological
profile from this guy.

607
00:34:57,821 --> 00:35:00,210
- Can we just get the pants?
- Can I get the pants?

608
00:35:00,286 --> 00:35:02,774
Item left too long.
We give them to homeless shelter.

609
00:35:02,846 --> 00:35:05,235
Are you insane? They were Armani.

610
00:35:05,309 --> 00:35:07,578
OK, let's go.

611
00:35:08,893 --> 00:35:10,104
Are you coming or not?

612
00:35:10,174 --> 00:35:12,214
They're pants,
what do you need 'em for?

613
00:35:21,918 --> 00:35:24,885
425, I think.

614
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:28,728
- Look familiar?
- Not really.

615
00:35:34,813 --> 00:35:36,090
Hi.

616
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:38,903
Hello.

617
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:41,531
- Can I help you?
- Hi.

618
00:35:41,598 --> 00:35:45,242
This might sound a little odd, but I was
wondering if you knew a certain woman.

619
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:47,993
Blond, about five-foot-one...

620
00:35:48,061 --> 00:35:49,884
- Two. And a half.
- Two and a half?

621
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:52,252
Oh, my God. Who are you?

622
00:35:52,318 --> 00:35:53,495
I don't know you. I...

623
00:35:53,565 --> 00:35:56,249
- Did my wife hire you?
- I'm sorry, what?

624
00:35:56,318 --> 00:35:57,911
I knew she'd find out.

625
00:35:57,982 --> 00:36:00,218
Whatever she's payin' you,
I'll double it.

626
00:36:00,285 --> 00:36:02,773
- Anything you want.
- I'm not looking for money.

627
00:36:02,845 --> 00:36:05,365
- Donald! Who is it?
- That's her. Come back around six.

628
00:36:05,437 --> 00:36:06,582
I'll have a check ready.

629
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:13,619
Wow.

630
00:36:17,182 --> 00:36:20,215
What? You don't think I actually
had sex with that old horndog.

631
00:36:20,285 --> 00:36:23,897
- Kind a looks that way, Lizzie.
- It's Elizabeth. And that's disgusting.

632
00:36:23,965 --> 00:36:27,675
Well, look on the bright side.
At 6:00, I'm coming into some money.

633
00:36:31,326 --> 00:36:32,919
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

634
00:36:37,534 --> 00:36:39,127
Oh, my God.

635
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,750
Maybe I was a slut.

636
00:36:41,821 --> 00:36:44,636
A lonely, home-wrecking slut.

637
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:58,168
So what if I was a slut? There's nothing
wrong with a healthy sexual appetite.

638
00:36:58,237 --> 00:36:59,186
Not at all.

639
00:36:59,262 --> 00:37:02,295
Look who I'm talking to,
Mr. Tried To Feel Me Up One Time.

640
00:37:02,365 --> 00:37:04,274
I'm trying to agree with you.

641
00:37:04,349 --> 00:37:05,876
- David.
- What?

642
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:07,226
This is it.

643
00:37:07,294 --> 00:37:09,203
You recognize it? Good.

644
00:37:09,278 --> 00:37:10,739
OK. Come on.

645
00:37:16,446 --> 00:37:18,867
This is Moose's.
I love this restaurant.

646
00:37:18,941 --> 00:37:20,730
- You ate here a lot.
- No.

647
00:37:20,798 --> 00:37:22,139
- No.
- I never did.

648
00:37:22,206 --> 00:37:25,402
I remember looking in that window
and wishing I could eat in here.

649
00:37:25,469 --> 00:37:28,884
What, were you a homeless
street urchin? Why didn't you?

650
00:37:28,957 --> 00:37:31,346
I wanted to,
I just never got around to it.

651
00:37:32,574 --> 00:37:35,738
Maybe the dry-cleaner guy
was right about me.

652
00:37:35,806 --> 00:37:37,399
Hello, can I help you?

653
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:39,739
No, thank you.
Maybe some other time.

654
00:37:40,573 --> 00:37:41,522
Kenny!

655
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:44,634
Lvan, call 911,
we need an ambulance!

656
00:37:44,702 --> 00:37:46,262
- Are you OK?
- Undo his collar.

657
00:37:46,333 --> 00:37:48,057
- Is he breathing?
- I can't tell.

658
00:37:48,126 --> 00:37:51,322
- Maybe we should do mouth-to-mouth.
- God. We need a doctor.

659
00:37:51,389 --> 00:37:52,982
We really have to find a doctor.

660
00:37:53,053 --> 00:37:55,737
Is there a doctor here? Anyone?

661
00:37:55,806 --> 00:37:57,399
- Feel his chest.
- What?

662
00:37:57,470 --> 00:37:59,706
His chest,
check and see if it's bloated.

663
00:37:59,773 --> 00:38:01,497
- How would I know?
- Just do it!

664
00:38:02,365 --> 00:38:05,399
Excuse me. Pardon me.
I need to feel his chest.

665
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:06,714
Can you feel his ribs?

666
00:38:06,782 --> 00:38:08,887
No, but I can if I press down.

667
00:38:08,958 --> 00:38:11,162
- What are you doing?
- Does he feel bloated?

668
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:12,572
- I think so.
- Think what?

669
00:38:12,638 --> 00:38:15,987
Tell them you'll need a sharp
paring knife and a bottle of vodka.

670
00:38:16,061 --> 00:38:18,396
I need a sharp paring knife
and a bottle of vodka.

671
00:38:18,461 --> 00:38:19,508
- Ivan?
- Yeah, got it.

672
00:38:19,581 --> 00:38:21,850
- What's wrong?
- It's a tension pneumothorax.

673
00:38:21,917 --> 00:38:24,056
- It's a tension nemothaxer.
- Pneumothorax.

674
00:38:24,125 --> 00:38:25,718
- Pneumothaxer.
- Pneumothorax.

675
00:38:25,789 --> 00:38:27,033
- Pneumathurman.
- Never mind.

676
00:38:27,101 --> 00:38:29,654
- Never mind!
- But what is it?

677
00:38:29,725 --> 00:38:31,896
Air is escaping
out of the lungs into his chest.

678
00:38:31,965 --> 00:38:33,623
...out of his lungs into his chest.

679
00:38:33,693 --> 00:38:35,254
- Open his shirt.
- Open his shirt.

680
00:38:35,326 --> 00:38:36,733
- No, you do it.
- I'll do it.

681
00:38:36,798 --> 00:38:39,667
A valve at the opening of the lungs.
If it doesn't close,

682
00:38:39,741 --> 00:38:42,840
it constricts the lungs
and compresses the organs.

683
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:45,910
I want you to feel for his ribs
again. A little bit lower.

684
00:38:45,982 --> 00:38:48,185
The spot between two ribs,
do you feel that?

685
00:38:48,254 --> 00:38:50,228
OK, splash some vodka on it.

686
00:38:50,301 --> 00:38:52,538
- All right. Get the knife.
- OK.

687
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:57,212
Can I ask everyone just
to stand back a little bit here?

688
00:38:57,277 --> 00:39:00,311
A little bit further, please.
A little bit further. Thank you.

689
00:39:00,382 --> 00:39:03,196
- What am I doing with the knife?
- Make an incision.

690
00:39:03,262 --> 00:39:05,301
You know what? No.

691
00:39:05,373 --> 00:39:08,635
- David, this man's life is at stake.
- I... I can't stab a man.

692
00:39:08,701 --> 00:39:10,806
OK. There's nothing to be afraid of.

693
00:39:10,877 --> 00:39:13,179
You're gonna make
a hole for the air to escape.

694
00:39:13,245 --> 00:39:15,350
So put the knife on that spot.

695
00:39:15,421 --> 00:39:17,079
Oh, my God.
How do you know this?

696
00:39:17,149 --> 00:39:20,346
I don't know, I just do. Now do it!
Put the knife there.

697
00:39:20,413 --> 00:39:22,933
Now, you're gonna need
to push harder than that.

698
00:39:23,005 --> 00:39:24,598
- A little bit harder.
- Oh, God!

699
00:39:24,669 --> 00:39:26,163
OK! OK, good! That's enough.

700
00:39:26,237 --> 00:39:29,107
All right, now, take the pourer
out of the vodka bottle.

701
00:39:29,182 --> 00:39:31,036
- What?
- You're doing good. Now...

702
00:39:31,102 --> 00:39:32,116
Hold on.

703
00:39:35,997 --> 00:39:38,234
- Go.
- Put the pourer in the hole you made.

704
00:39:38,301 --> 00:39:39,250
What?

705
00:39:39,325 --> 00:39:41,944
It's gonna keep the wound open
so air can escape. Do it!

706
00:39:42,014 --> 00:39:43,923
- I can't.
- Do it.

707
00:39:46,974 --> 00:39:48,861
- He's breathing.
- He's breathing!

708
00:39:48,925 --> 00:39:50,486
He's breathing!

709
00:39:50,558 --> 00:39:51,932
I'm a doctor.

710
00:39:51,997 --> 00:39:53,044
I'm a doctor!

711
00:39:53,117 --> 00:39:56,630
I know. Thank God. The ambulance
will be here right away.

712
00:39:56,701 --> 00:39:58,741
Ask him where the nearest hospital is.

713
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:00,788
Do you know where
the nearest hospital is?

714
00:40:00,862 --> 00:40:02,291
A few blocks, St. Matthews.

715
00:40:02,365 --> 00:40:04,275
- Thank you.
- St. Matthews?

716
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:07,579
I may have been a home-wrecking
whore, but I saved lives.

717
00:40:07,645 --> 00:40:10,776
I worked in that hospital.
I know it, it sounds so familiar.

718
00:40:10,845 --> 00:40:13,333
- I've never saved a life before.
- It's the best.

719
00:40:13,405 --> 00:40:16,536
One minute you're looking at
this monitor, it says "game over,"

720
00:40:16,605 --> 00:40:19,093
then you bring it back,
a little blip and it's there!

721
00:40:19,165 --> 00:40:21,882
- What's that?
- That's just a little blood.

722
00:40:24,862 --> 00:40:25,810
David?

723
00:40:31,261 --> 00:40:33,814
- I work here.
- You did?

724
00:40:33,885 --> 00:40:36,602
The receptionist, her name is Amita.

725
00:40:36,669 --> 00:40:38,196
It's all coming back to me now.

726
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:40,156
There's Bill and Karen

727
00:40:40,221 --> 00:40:42,556
and Michael and...

728
00:40:42,621 --> 00:40:45,817
Elizabeth? You mean Elizabeth Masterson?

729
00:40:45,886 --> 00:40:49,660
- Masterson. Yes, that's my name.
- Yes, that's it. Elizabeth Masterson.

730
00:40:50,973 --> 00:40:53,526
Dr. Masterson is...

731
00:40:53,597 --> 00:40:57,209
...is not active on our staff right now.

732
00:40:57,277 --> 00:40:59,514
Hold on. Let me talk to someone.

733
00:41:01,309 --> 00:41:02,356
Excuse me, doctor?

734
00:41:02,429 --> 00:41:03,956
Oh, no, she's got the tone.

735
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:05,404
- What tone?
- The tone.

736
00:41:05,469 --> 00:41:08,055
You're trying to pass the buck
onto somebody else

737
00:41:08,125 --> 00:41:10,034
to tell you your friend died!

738
00:41:10,109 --> 00:41:11,832
Excuse me, sir.

739
00:41:11,901 --> 00:41:15,480
I need you to go to
the third-floor nurses' station.

740
00:41:17,277 --> 00:41:19,960
Oh, no, it's Fran. She's my mentor.

741
00:41:20,029 --> 00:41:22,037
They wouldn't send us
here if it wasn't bad.

742
00:41:22,109 --> 00:41:23,287
- Mr. Abbott?
- Hi, yes.

743
00:41:23,357 --> 00:41:24,819
- Fran Lo.
- Nice to meet you.

744
00:41:24,894 --> 00:41:27,577
You've been inquiring
about Elizabeth Masterson?

745
00:41:27,645 --> 00:41:30,296
Right. Could you tell me
what happened to her?

746
00:41:30,365 --> 00:41:32,569
I need to know
your relationship with her.

747
00:41:32,637 --> 00:41:35,736
Tell her you're my boyfriend.
She can't tell you anything

748
00:41:35,806 --> 00:41:38,261
unless she knows
we're intimately connected.

749
00:41:38,334 --> 00:41:41,116
We were romantic with each other.

750
00:41:41,181 --> 00:41:43,963
- What do you mean?
- You know, boyfriend-girlfriend.

751
00:41:44,029 --> 00:41:46,004
I know what romantic means,

752
00:41:46,077 --> 00:41:48,892
but I... I have
a hard time believing that.

753
00:41:48,957 --> 00:41:50,812
- What? Why?
- What? Why?

754
00:41:50,877 --> 00:41:53,430
Elizabeth's whole life
was this hospital.

755
00:41:53,501 --> 00:41:54,962
"Was"? Did she say "was"?

756
00:41:55,037 --> 00:41:57,404
I don't know of a single date
she'd ever been on.

757
00:41:57,469 --> 00:42:00,884
We were fairly recent.
I live in her apartment...

758
00:42:00,957 --> 00:42:02,484
- David.
- Building.

759
00:42:02,557 --> 00:42:05,339
So, you don't know about the accident.

760
00:42:05,405 --> 00:42:07,315
Accident.

761
00:42:08,477 --> 00:42:10,965
Oh, God, David. I remember it.

762
00:42:12,061 --> 00:42:13,239
It was awful.

763
00:42:14,077 --> 00:42:16,248
I was... I've been away.

764
00:42:16,317 --> 00:42:18,456
It was three months ago.

765
00:42:18,525 --> 00:42:20,827
Three months.

766
00:42:20,893 --> 00:42:22,835
I'm sorry.

767
00:42:22,909 --> 00:42:26,521
I was away for awhile
on a business trip.

768
00:43:02,813 --> 00:43:04,275
Oh, my God.

769
00:43:05,757 --> 00:43:07,764
What was that?
You were, like, flying.

770
00:43:09,885 --> 00:43:12,919
Oh, my God. It's you.

771
00:43:14,653 --> 00:43:16,376
It's you, it's really you.

772
00:43:16,445 --> 00:43:18,747
You're... you're not dead,
you're alive.

773
00:43:18,813 --> 00:43:21,399
I know, David, but I'm in a coma.
This is not good.

774
00:43:21,469 --> 00:43:23,192
Well, it's way better than dead.

775
00:43:23,261 --> 00:43:25,563
Look at you.
Your body is healing, it's...

776
00:43:25,629 --> 00:43:28,411
You don't have any scars.
You look pretty.

777
00:43:30,397 --> 00:43:32,121
It doesn't matter how I look.

778
00:43:32,189 --> 00:43:34,610
Three months,
that's a persistent coma.

779
00:43:34,685 --> 00:43:36,758
We're here now.
Let's do something.

780
00:43:36,829 --> 00:43:38,170
Like what?

781
00:43:38,238 --> 00:43:41,205
Like... I don't know.
You're the doctor.

782
00:43:41,277 --> 00:43:43,132
Right. Right.

783
00:43:45,437 --> 00:43:46,811
- Forget it.
- What?

784
00:43:46,878 --> 00:43:48,187
I was gonna say that we...

785
00:43:48,253 --> 00:43:51,155
I need to find a way
to put myself together again.

786
00:43:51,229 --> 00:43:54,458
OK, good, good. That's great.
How do we do that?

787
00:43:54,525 --> 00:43:56,500
Maybe I should try this.

788
00:44:01,373 --> 00:44:02,683
Something's happening!

789
00:44:02,749 --> 00:44:04,789
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
I think it's working!

790
00:44:04,861 --> 00:44:07,000
Yeah? No.

791
00:44:07,069 --> 00:44:08,727
Let me try again.

792
00:44:08,797 --> 00:44:10,172
I mean, really focus on it.

793
00:44:10,237 --> 00:44:12,124
Hold on inside there.

794
00:44:15,901 --> 00:44:17,494
I'm not sticking.

795
00:44:17,565 --> 00:44:20,118
It's like I'm no longer
connected to this body.

796
00:44:20,189 --> 00:44:23,255
All right, all right, all right,
all right. Turn around.

797
00:44:23,325 --> 00:44:25,180
- What?
- I want to try something.

798
00:44:25,245 --> 00:44:26,521
OK.

799
00:44:33,373 --> 00:44:34,387
You felt that.

800
00:44:34,461 --> 00:44:35,606
My hand tingled.

801
00:44:35,677 --> 00:44:38,165
You are still connected to your body.

802
00:44:38,237 --> 00:44:39,731
The monitor doesn't agree.

803
00:44:39,805 --> 00:44:41,365
Machines don't know everything.

804
00:44:41,437 --> 00:44:43,641
Everything in my training
tells me they do.

805
00:44:43,709 --> 00:44:45,651
Then how are we having
this conversation?

806
00:44:45,725 --> 00:44:47,896
I don't know.

807
00:44:47,965 --> 00:44:50,714
Mr. Abbott? I'm sorry.
I have an appointment,

808
00:44:50,781 --> 00:44:53,236
and I can't leave you here unattended.

809
00:44:53,309 --> 00:44:55,698
Can I just have a couple
more minutes, please?

810
00:44:55,773 --> 00:44:56,918
I'm saying goodbye.

811
00:44:56,989 --> 00:44:59,029
- Of course.
- Thank you.

812
00:44:59,101 --> 00:45:01,522
My nieces must have
made these things for me.

813
00:45:01,597 --> 00:45:04,445
Wow, that's an amazing likeness.

814
00:45:06,237 --> 00:45:08,212
Look at this.

815
00:45:08,285 --> 00:45:10,838
That's the picture
from my nightstand.

816
00:45:10,909 --> 00:45:12,316
Abby must have brought it.

817
00:45:12,381 --> 00:45:13,625
You look great.

818
00:45:16,765 --> 00:45:18,106
Look at me now.

819
00:45:19,453 --> 00:45:21,940
These levels aren't changing, David.

820
00:45:22,013 --> 00:45:23,923
If anything, they're decreasing.

821
00:45:26,653 --> 00:45:29,271
- I'm gonna have to leave soon.
- All right.

822
00:45:29,341 --> 00:45:31,894
Want me to wait
downstairs in the lobby?

823
00:45:31,965 --> 00:45:35,031
No, no, that's sweet.
You should go.

824
00:45:35,101 --> 00:45:36,662
Thank you for helping me.

825
00:45:36,733 --> 00:45:38,838
It was my pleasure.

826
00:45:39,804 --> 00:45:42,488
Are you sure you don't want
to come back with me?

827
00:45:42,557 --> 00:45:44,924
After all,
it is your apartment. It's fine.

828
00:45:45,949 --> 00:45:48,764
After I made it here, I...

829
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:51,512
...can't imagine
leaving myself, you know?

830
00:45:51,581 --> 00:45:53,010
OK, I know, I just...

831
00:45:53,085 --> 00:45:55,322
It just feels weird
leaving you here alone.

832
00:45:56,509 --> 00:45:58,396
I don't know where else I belong.

833
00:45:58,461 --> 00:46:01,722
Mr. Abbott. I'm sorry.

834
00:46:05,437 --> 00:46:07,160
Goodbye, Elizabeth.

835
00:46:10,141 --> 00:46:11,417
Goodbye.

836
00:46:18,653 --> 00:46:20,693
Oh, I hate this.

837
00:46:20,765 --> 00:46:22,740
She finally gets a life, and then...

838
00:46:22,813 --> 00:46:24,635
You know what?
That guy was cute.

839
00:46:24,701 --> 00:46:27,548
At least she got a chance
to hang with him for a little while.

840
00:46:27,613 --> 00:46:30,646
Yeah. It woulda been awful
if she'd gone through her whole life

841
00:46:30,717 --> 00:46:33,499
not knowing what it was all about.

842
00:46:49,021 --> 00:46:51,476
Oh, my God. Jenny?

843
00:46:51,549 --> 00:46:54,419
No wonder
I could never find you.

844
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:03,089
I guess you got my job.

845
00:47:03,165 --> 00:47:06,514
Yeah. I think I've earned it.
I deserve it.

846
00:47:06,589 --> 00:47:08,476
Everything
you thought it would be?

847
00:47:08,541 --> 00:47:12,218
It is. And it's time to upgrade
from the 330 to the 740.

848
00:47:12,285 --> 00:47:14,706
I'm goin' to the dealer tonight.

849
00:47:14,781 --> 00:47:17,148
Hold on. It's Walsh,
I have to take this.

850
00:47:17,213 --> 00:47:18,490
Hello?

851
00:47:18,557 --> 00:47:20,793
Really? You want me to do it?

852
00:47:22,141 --> 00:47:23,668
Sure, of course I can.

853
00:47:28,861 --> 00:47:31,676
Dude, did you know I can get
a built-in jack for my iPod?

854
00:47:31,741 --> 00:47:34,075
Did you know there's
people out there dying?

855
00:47:34,141 --> 00:47:37,175
- I'm in a coma, have you noticed?
- I know. Sweet!

856
00:47:44,701 --> 00:47:47,156
Zoe? Lily Vanilli?

857
00:47:48,285 --> 00:47:51,002
Oh, my God,
you guys got so big!

858
00:47:53,181 --> 00:47:54,326
Beat ya!

859
00:47:54,397 --> 00:47:55,990
- Did not!
- Did too!

860
00:47:56,061 --> 00:47:57,588
- Did not!
- Did too!

861
00:47:57,661 --> 00:47:58,708
Did not!
Did too!

862
00:47:58,781 --> 00:48:00,636
How could I feel him
and not you guys?

863
00:48:00,701 --> 00:48:02,010
- Did not!
- Did too!

864
00:48:02,077 --> 00:48:04,314
- Oh, that's funny.
- Abby.

865
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:06,617
I remember saying
no running, no screaming!

866
00:48:06,684 --> 00:48:09,368
- Abby, can you feel me?
- All right, chill, I'm serious.

867
00:48:09,437 --> 00:48:10,811
I guess not.

868
00:48:10,877 --> 00:48:13,594
- I hope you feel better.
- Get well soon.

869
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:14,871
I love you.

870
00:48:14,941 --> 00:48:17,308
I remember when you pushed us...

871
00:48:17,373 --> 00:48:19,348
It's so sweet you guys
come and visit me.

872
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:21,973
- And I really miss...
- Excuse me.

873
00:48:22,044 --> 00:48:23,637
- Mrs. Brody, hi.
- Hi.

874
00:48:23,709 --> 00:48:26,327
Dr. Rushton.
Could I have a quick word?

875
00:48:26,396 --> 00:48:28,949
- Sure.
- What do you want?

876
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:32,337
First of all, I hope you know how much
we all love and miss Elizabeth.

877
00:48:32,413 --> 00:48:34,834
Please. He's doing
high fives he's not in Phoenix.

878
00:48:34,909 --> 00:48:37,462
Because she was
a senior resident here,

879
00:48:37,533 --> 00:48:39,638
we've taken some
extraordinary measures

880
00:48:39,709 --> 00:48:42,873
to make her feel more comfortable
these last three months.

881
00:48:42,941 --> 00:48:45,210
Lily! Turn it back!

882
00:48:45,277 --> 00:48:46,706
Zoe, what did we talk about?

883
00:48:46,781 --> 00:48:48,756
Watch your sister. Sorry.

884
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:51,831
This is hard to say.

885
00:48:51,901 --> 00:48:54,389
When we come to work here,

886
00:48:54,461 --> 00:48:56,436
we are asked to sign release forms.

887
00:48:56,508 --> 00:48:57,686
OK.

888
00:48:57,757 --> 00:48:59,317
I don't like the sound of this.

889
00:48:59,388 --> 00:49:02,804
Did you know your sister's opinion
about artificially prolonging life?

890
00:49:04,413 --> 00:49:06,235
- No.
- She was against it.

891
00:49:06,301 --> 00:49:07,316
Really?

892
00:49:07,389 --> 00:49:09,844
OK, that was before.
I am completely for it now.

893
00:49:09,917 --> 00:49:12,983
Honestly, most in our
profession feel that way.

894
00:49:13,053 --> 00:49:15,474
Not me! I'm perfectly happy.

895
00:49:15,549 --> 00:49:16,826
Come on, Abby!

896
00:49:16,893 --> 00:49:18,933
You have got to feel me,
I'm your sister!

897
00:49:19,005 --> 00:49:21,722
But there's still some
brain activity, isn't there?

898
00:49:21,789 --> 00:49:23,894
People have woken up
from this kind of coma.

899
00:49:23,965 --> 00:49:26,169
- All the time.
- Not on any record I've found.

900
00:49:26,237 --> 00:49:30,011
Of course they have!
Otherwise, what am I doing here?

901
00:49:30,077 --> 00:49:32,215
I feel car sick.

902
00:49:32,284 --> 00:49:35,001
- What are you doing?
- We're looking for the stick.

903
00:49:35,069 --> 00:49:36,017
What stick?

904
00:49:36,093 --> 00:49:39,093
- You said she had a stick up her...
- Stop it! Come on.

905
00:49:39,165 --> 00:49:41,718
TV is going to become
a very dim memory for you two.

906
00:49:41,789 --> 00:49:43,960
Mrs. Brody,
Elizabeth did sign a release.

907
00:49:44,029 --> 00:49:45,916
Because of the special situation,

908
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:49,428
we won't take any terminal action
without your explicit approval.

909
00:49:49,501 --> 00:49:51,476
Now, I've prepared this paperwork...

910
00:49:51,549 --> 00:49:52,923
Don't sign that. I'm here!

911
00:49:52,989 --> 00:49:55,444
...if you decide to sign...
- I'll think about it.

912
00:49:55,517 --> 00:49:58,168
Abby, I'll baby-sit more, I swear!

913
00:49:58,237 --> 00:50:00,059
Those jeans you love?
They're yours!

914
00:50:00,124 --> 00:50:02,034
We sometimes find that it's easier

915
00:50:02,109 --> 00:50:05,305
just to ask God's forgiveness
and not prolong the inevitable.

916
00:50:05,372 --> 00:50:06,801
I said I'd think about it.

917
00:50:08,541 --> 00:50:10,396
Thank you, Abby.

918
00:50:10,461 --> 00:50:12,250
You always looked out for me.

919
00:50:23,709 --> 00:50:25,051
You here?

920
00:50:29,405 --> 00:50:30,747
I guess not.

921
00:51:25,149 --> 00:51:26,872
I'm locked out.

922
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:50,169
Doesn't this location
make San Francisco bearable?

923
00:51:50,237 --> 00:51:52,920
Wait, you're not from here,
are you? Oh, good.

924
00:51:52,989 --> 00:51:55,477
And what's with all
the single men in this town?

925
00:51:55,549 --> 00:51:59,029
Every time I meet
a good-looking guy... lesbian.

926
00:51:59,101 --> 00:52:00,475
It's tough.

927
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:03,475
I'd get on the phone and I'd be like,

928
00:52:03,549 --> 00:52:05,404
"Hello? Osama?

929
00:52:05,469 --> 00:52:07,324
Communism is so over.

930
00:52:07,389 --> 00:52:09,723
Like, give your people toilet paper."

931
00:52:09,789 --> 00:52:11,643
So, like, if I had to choose?

932
00:52:11,709 --> 00:52:13,137
If I had to choose.

933
00:52:14,749 --> 00:52:16,025
Wow.

934
00:52:17,244 --> 00:52:19,415
I guess I'd have to go
with the midget.

935
00:52:19,484 --> 00:52:21,459
I'm sorry...

936
00:52:22,204 --> 00:52:24,441
The locksmith,
does he know to ring my unit?

937
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:27,737
I think so.

938
00:52:29,213 --> 00:52:30,423
Where's your bathroom?

939
00:52:30,492 --> 00:52:32,881
- It's right down the hall there.
- OK.

940
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:45,977
- Elizabeth!
- Yeah.

941
00:52:46,044 --> 00:52:48,761
No, I just... I didn't think
you were gonna come back.

942
00:52:48,828 --> 00:52:51,959
I thought you were gonna stay
at the hospital with your body.

943
00:52:52,028 --> 00:52:55,062
It's terrible. They're trying
to get my sister to sign papers

944
00:52:55,133 --> 00:52:58,068
authorizing permission
to take me off of life support.

945
00:52:58,140 --> 00:53:00,759
- No! What? They can't do that!
- I know. I said that.

946
00:53:00,829 --> 00:53:02,039
Nobody could hear me.

947
00:53:02,109 --> 00:53:03,964
And I just wanted to talk to you.

948
00:53:04,029 --> 00:53:06,200
- David!
- Just a minute!

949
00:53:06,268 --> 00:53:09,268
Well, that didn't take very long.

950
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:10,682
No.

951
00:53:10,749 --> 00:53:12,407
No, she barged in.

952
00:53:12,476 --> 00:53:14,483
She got locked out of her apartment.

953
00:53:14,556 --> 00:53:17,873
- You don't have to explain. I get it.
- No, you don't get anything.

954
00:53:17,948 --> 00:53:19,410
She's using the bathroom...

955
00:53:19,485 --> 00:53:21,819
Her voice sounded
like it came from the bedroom.

956
00:53:21,884 --> 00:53:23,029
It did?

957
00:53:23,388 --> 00:53:26,072
Come here.
I want to show you something.

958
00:53:26,813 --> 00:53:28,853
When you know, you know, right?

959
00:53:28,925 --> 00:53:31,445
I had no idea that's...

960
00:53:31,517 --> 00:53:33,589
You had no idea
she was naked on your bed.

961
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:34,937
No.

962
00:53:36,796 --> 00:53:38,771
You're wondering
what she looks like.

963
00:53:38,844 --> 00:53:40,088
- No, I'm not.
- A little?

964
00:53:40,157 --> 00:53:41,848
Not enough to go look.

965
00:53:41,917 --> 00:53:44,121
Tell you what.
I'll do a little recon for ya.

966
00:53:44,189 --> 00:53:46,709
- Please don't!
- Don't worry. I'm a doctor.

967
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:50,129
- Elizabeth. No, no, no, no, no.
- Relax.

968
00:53:52,796 --> 00:53:54,454
She's got a tattoo on her ass.

969
00:53:56,509 --> 00:53:57,752
It says "All aboard."

970
00:53:57,821 --> 00:54:00,090
- Really?
- In three languages.

971
00:54:00,157 --> 00:54:02,393
- Oh, that's funny.
- She's very cultural.

972
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:03,987
You know, you sound jealous.

973
00:54:04,060 --> 00:54:05,849
- Oh, please.
- You do.

974
00:54:05,917 --> 00:54:07,957
Are you talkin' to someone?

975
00:54:08,668 --> 00:54:11,767
- Hey, what's goin' on?
- Eyes up top, David.

976
00:54:12,893 --> 00:54:14,518
Nothing.

977
00:54:14,588 --> 00:54:17,523
Look, I'm sorry if I'm coming on
a little too strong.

978
00:54:17,597 --> 00:54:19,506
That's just my style.

979
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:21,206
I hear you sometimes.

980
00:54:21,277 --> 00:54:24,026
Up here...

981
00:54:24,092 --> 00:54:25,685
...by yourself...

982
00:54:27,293 --> 00:54:29,529
And I just figured...

983
00:54:29,596 --> 00:54:31,255
...maybe he's lonely.

984
00:54:31,325 --> 00:54:32,851
I know I am.

985
00:54:33,661 --> 00:54:36,116
Is it wrong for me
to want to touch someone?

986
00:54:36,189 --> 00:54:37,782
To be close?

987
00:54:37,853 --> 00:54:40,919
Feel a warm body next to me?

988
00:54:40,989 --> 00:54:42,876
David, just do it.

989
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:43,955
What?

990
00:54:44,028 --> 00:54:46,843
Go ahead, be with her.
It's what you both want.

991
00:54:46,908 --> 00:54:49,625
- No, it isn't.
- Are you all right?

992
00:54:50,173 --> 00:54:53,522
Do you... wanna take
some kind of medication first?

993
00:54:53,596 --> 00:54:54,807
It's cool if you do.

994
00:54:54,877 --> 00:54:56,917
David, it's OK.

995
00:54:56,989 --> 00:54:59,858
She's beautiful, and she's
right here in front of you.

996
00:54:59,933 --> 00:55:02,169
- And I'm in the way.
- No, you're not.

997
00:55:02,236 --> 00:55:04,986
Elizabeth. Elizabeth!

998
00:55:10,172 --> 00:55:11,765
It's Katrina.

999
00:55:24,645 --> 00:55:26,107
That was quick.

1000
00:55:27,206 --> 00:55:28,929
Come on, nothing happened.

1001
00:55:31,686 --> 00:55:33,725
What'd you say to her?

1002
00:55:36,038 --> 00:55:37,696
That I was seeing someone.

1003
00:55:39,238 --> 00:55:40,765
Honestly?

1004
00:55:41,221 --> 00:55:44,767
Well, I didn't mention
that I was the only person who could.

1005
00:55:50,117 --> 00:55:51,776
You know, I haven't...

1006
00:55:53,062 --> 00:55:55,363
...haven't really been
with anyone since...

1007
00:55:55,430 --> 00:55:57,022
...since Laura.

1008
00:55:59,334 --> 00:56:01,439
She was cursing at her shoe.

1009
00:56:02,630 --> 00:56:04,288
Her heel had broken.

1010
00:56:07,206 --> 00:56:10,272
And then she just kind a sat down

1011
00:56:10,342 --> 00:56:12,480
and put her hand to her head.

1012
00:56:12,549 --> 00:56:14,589
Oerebral hemorrhage?

1013
00:56:19,173 --> 00:56:21,083
And...

1014
00:56:24,742 --> 00:56:26,651
I couldn't do anything to help her.

1015
00:56:27,686 --> 00:56:29,344
She was, like, gone.

1016
00:56:29,413 --> 00:56:32,031
I couldn't even say goodbye,
and she was just...

1017
00:56:32,742 --> 00:56:34,084
She's gone.

1018
00:56:40,293 --> 00:56:41,952
What was she like?

1019
00:56:42,982 --> 00:56:45,796
You know, she was just
a big pain in the ass.

1020
00:56:46,566 --> 00:56:47,907
No, really.

1021
00:56:47,973 --> 00:56:50,788
I mean, the bras on the doorknobs,

1022
00:56:50,853 --> 00:56:54,498
leaving the car with the...
with the gas needle below empty.

1023
00:56:54,566 --> 00:56:57,566
She couldn't put gas in the car.
It was impossible for her.

1024
00:56:57,638 --> 00:57:02,013
And just total stubborn inability
to master a remote.

1025
00:57:02,086 --> 00:57:04,322
So she would just
randomly click buttons,

1026
00:57:04,389 --> 00:57:08,219
until the TV was snarled into
some unmanageable condition.

1027
00:57:08,294 --> 00:57:10,715
I mean, I'm so...

1028
00:57:10,790 --> 00:57:12,797
I'm mad just thinking...

1029
00:57:16,005 --> 00:57:17,282
...thinking about her.

1030
00:57:20,101 --> 00:57:21,694
I'm sorry, David.

1031
00:57:23,366 --> 00:57:26,432
Your sister really wouldn't
sign those papers, would she?

1032
00:57:26,502 --> 00:57:28,411
I don't know.

1033
00:57:29,445 --> 00:57:31,038
I hope not.

1034
00:57:32,710 --> 00:57:35,198
Won't even matter
if I don't wake up soon.

1035
00:57:35,269 --> 00:57:37,790
My brain activity's
decreasing every day.

1036
00:57:37,862 --> 00:57:39,869
Maybe that's not such a bad thing.

1037
00:57:39,942 --> 00:57:41,949
You're kind of a smarty-pants.

1038
00:57:42,693 --> 00:57:44,701
No, it'll bring you down to my level.

1039
00:57:44,774 --> 00:57:47,773
You're not dumb, David,
just a little lazy.

1040
00:57:47,845 --> 00:57:49,820
Cute, but lazy.

1041
00:57:49,894 --> 00:57:50,974
Thank you.

1042
00:57:52,037 --> 00:57:54,142
I wasn't always like this, you know.

1043
00:57:55,238 --> 00:57:56,863
What were you like?

1044
00:58:00,933 --> 00:58:02,657
Come on.

1045
00:58:02,726 --> 00:58:04,514
I want to show you something.

1046
00:58:15,718 --> 00:58:17,627
- Where are we?
- It's an estate.

1047
00:58:17,701 --> 00:58:19,676
The guy's in Hawaii this time of year.

1048
00:58:19,750 --> 00:58:23,011
- Are we trespassing?
- Don't worry, we're not going inside.

1049
00:58:24,006 --> 00:58:25,282
Here it is.

1050
00:58:31,845 --> 00:58:33,700
You said you love gardens.

1051
00:58:33,765 --> 00:58:35,292
What is this place?

1052
00:58:35,366 --> 00:58:37,340
I made this place.

1053
00:58:39,589 --> 00:58:40,996
This is my work.

1054
00:58:41,830 --> 00:58:44,961
I was a landscape architect.
I had my own company for awhile.

1055
00:58:46,821 --> 00:58:48,512
David, I've been here before.

1056
00:58:49,445 --> 00:58:50,525
What do you mean?

1057
00:58:50,597 --> 00:58:52,834
I know this is gonna
sound really strange,

1058
00:58:52,902 --> 00:58:55,323
but I dreamed of this place.

1059
00:58:56,742 --> 00:58:59,611
These flowers, everything.

1060
00:59:00,453 --> 00:59:02,625
It's beautiful.

1061
00:59:02,694 --> 00:59:04,865
I had no idea, David.

1062
00:59:04,933 --> 00:59:07,551
What a joy it must be
to create a place like this.

1063
00:59:09,637 --> 00:59:10,914
Yeah, it was.

1064
00:59:10,982 --> 00:59:12,443
Is it gonna be again?

1065
00:59:14,022 --> 00:59:15,004
Sure.

1066
00:59:15,078 --> 00:59:16,507
Promise?

1067
00:59:33,541 --> 00:59:35,363
Who the hell's calling me?

1068
00:59:35,429 --> 00:59:36,836
Hello?

1069
00:59:36,902 --> 00:59:38,243
David, it's Grace.

1070
00:59:38,309 --> 00:59:41,408
Well, you are the luckiest man
in San Francisco.

1071
00:59:41,477 --> 00:59:43,844
Thank you. Why do you say that?

1072
00:59:43,909 --> 00:59:45,797
Great news, the apartment is yours.

1073
00:59:45,861 --> 00:59:48,381
And they're willing
to give you a nice long lease.

1074
00:59:48,453 --> 00:59:49,730
How long a lease?

1075
00:59:49,798 --> 00:59:51,838
Really long.
And I'm gonna send it over,

1076
00:59:51,910 --> 00:59:54,495
- and I'll talk to you tomorrow.
- Wait, wait, wait.

1077
00:59:54,565 --> 00:59:56,540
Why are they giving me
a long lease now?

1078
00:59:56,614 --> 00:59:59,843
It's a terrible story. The tenant
was in some kind of coma,

1079
00:59:59,909 --> 01:00:02,495
and it is what it is,
so they're gonna pull the plug.

1080
01:00:02,566 --> 01:00:06,428
But get this: They are gonna
throw in that couch you like.

1081
01:00:06,501 --> 01:00:08,640
- David?
- What?

1082
01:00:08,709 --> 01:00:10,269
We gotta go talk to your sister.

1083
01:00:10,341 --> 01:00:12,097
Why? What are you gonna say to her?

1084
01:00:12,165 --> 01:00:14,402
I don't know. What kind of dirt
do you have on her?

1085
01:00:14,469 --> 01:00:16,225
Her middle name is Ellen.

1086
01:00:16,293 --> 01:00:19,871
In the third grade she told everybody
it was Leia, like Princess Leia.

1087
01:00:19,941 --> 01:00:21,086
What else?

1088
01:00:22,309 --> 01:00:24,164
She's lactose intolerant.

1089
01:00:24,229 --> 01:00:26,204
All right, the only way
this is gonna work

1090
01:00:26,278 --> 01:00:28,733
is if I could tell her something
that only you know.

1091
01:00:28,806 --> 01:00:31,457
Something so intimate, so personal...

1092
01:00:31,526 --> 01:00:35,300
She French-kissed her ex-boyfriend J.J.
Five minutes before her wedding.

1093
01:00:35,366 --> 01:00:36,959
Oh, that'll work. That's good.

1094
01:00:37,030 --> 01:00:40,029
- Nobody knows that.
- That... I think I like her already.

1095
01:00:46,790 --> 01:00:50,051
So, how did you know Elizabeth?
You must've worked together.

1096
01:00:50,118 --> 01:00:53,914
- God knows she wasn't dating anybody.
- Everybody likes to rub that one in.

1097
01:00:53,989 --> 01:00:57,120
Actually, this is gonna be
a little difficult to swallow...

1098
01:00:57,190 --> 01:00:58,204
Tea!

1099
01:00:58,277 --> 01:01:00,994
My nieces are here?
They're supposed to be at school.

1100
01:01:01,061 --> 01:01:02,850
- Hi.
- Would you like some tea, sir?

1101
01:01:02,917 --> 01:01:04,477
Well, yes, thank you, madam.

1102
01:01:04,549 --> 01:01:07,997
Abort. Don't do this in front of them,
it's gonna freak them out.

1103
01:01:08,069 --> 01:01:10,884
I'm sorry, you were saying?
How did you know her?

1104
01:01:10,949 --> 01:01:12,891
- Lie your butt off.
- We worked together.

1105
01:01:12,966 --> 01:01:14,111
- No!
- No.

1106
01:01:14,181 --> 01:01:17,214
No, no, no. You're not credible
as a doctor. Make something up.

1107
01:01:17,285 --> 01:01:20,547
I mean, I didn't work with her.
We worked together on my illness.

1108
01:01:20,613 --> 01:01:21,857
I was a patient of hers.

1109
01:01:21,925 --> 01:01:24,096
Lily? Can you see me?

1110
01:01:24,165 --> 01:01:26,849
I was sick. I had meningitis.

1111
01:01:26,917 --> 01:01:28,608
Spiral meningitis.

1112
01:01:28,678 --> 01:01:29,954
I'm so sorry.

1113
01:01:30,021 --> 01:01:31,963
Spiral meningitis?
It's not a disease.

1114
01:01:32,037 --> 01:01:34,372
Oh, no, it's OK.
I'm much better now.

1115
01:01:34,438 --> 01:01:35,386
I...

1116
01:01:35,461 --> 01:01:37,501
Elizabeth, she believed in me,

1117
01:01:37,573 --> 01:01:40,835
believed that I would recover
when nobody else did.

1118
01:01:40,902 --> 01:01:42,309
And then I did.

1119
01:01:42,373 --> 01:01:44,228
That sounds just like her.

1120
01:01:44,293 --> 01:01:47,010
But why are you telling me this?

1121
01:01:48,133 --> 01:01:51,842
Because I know about
Elizabeth's situation,

1122
01:01:51,909 --> 01:01:54,397
and I just wanna say that...

1123
01:01:54,469 --> 01:01:56,030
Lily.

1124
01:01:56,101 --> 01:01:58,916
...there are things...
- You know I'm here, don't you?

1125
01:01:58,981 --> 01:02:00,508
...sometimes that...

1126
01:02:00,581 --> 01:02:02,785
...that are beyond our understanding.

1127
01:02:04,485 --> 01:02:07,355
And so, I just wanted to ask you...

1128
01:02:07,430 --> 01:02:10,397
Actually, I just want to beg you

1129
01:02:10,469 --> 01:02:13,120
to... to give her
a little bit more time.

1130
01:02:13,190 --> 01:02:15,394
She's gonna pull through this thing.

1131
01:02:15,462 --> 01:02:16,891
I just know it.

1132
01:02:16,965 --> 01:02:18,875
That's really sweet of you to say,

1133
01:02:18,950 --> 01:02:21,950
but... it's kind a too late.

1134
01:02:22,021 --> 01:02:23,069
Abby.

1135
01:02:23,142 --> 01:02:25,313
- What do you mean?
- Abby, what did you do?

1136
01:02:26,278 --> 01:02:27,619
It's David, right?

1137
01:02:28,869 --> 01:02:32,611
You see, it's too late because
I've already signed the papers.

1138
01:02:32,677 --> 01:02:35,099
Abby. I'm here.

1139
01:02:35,173 --> 01:02:36,961
Can you feel me? I'm right here.

1140
01:02:37,029 --> 01:02:39,648
We're terminating life support
tomorrow at noon,

1141
01:02:39,718 --> 01:02:41,889
while the girls are in school.

1142
01:02:41,957 --> 01:02:44,892
I mean, the past three months
have been so hard on them,

1143
01:02:44,966 --> 01:02:46,394
on this whole family.

1144
01:02:46,469 --> 01:02:48,379
Well, I understand that. I really do.

1145
01:02:48,454 --> 01:02:50,843
But I think you're makin'
a grave mistake here,

1146
01:02:50,917 --> 01:02:54,179
- because I really believe...
- It's for the best. Really.

1147
01:02:54,245 --> 01:02:55,739
This is what Elizabeth wanted.

1148
01:02:57,061 --> 01:03:00,377
I mean, I spent my whole life thinking
I knew what was best for her.

1149
01:03:00,453 --> 01:03:03,802
What she should wear,
what men she should date.

1150
01:03:05,477 --> 01:03:07,517
This is the last thing
Elizabeth asked for.

1151
01:03:08,837 --> 01:03:12,481
And for the first time in my life,
I'm gonna respect her wishes.

1152
01:03:14,341 --> 01:03:16,577
Oh, Abby.

1153
01:03:16,645 --> 01:03:17,987
Look.

1154
01:03:19,013 --> 01:03:21,599
This is gonna sound
really strange to you, but...

1155
01:03:21,669 --> 01:03:22,617
Oh, no, no, no.

1156
01:03:22,693 --> 01:03:25,214
...the truth is Elizabeth
is here with us right now.

1157
01:03:25,285 --> 01:03:29,563
She came here with me, she's standing
next to you, begging you to wait.

1158
01:03:29,638 --> 01:03:31,426
Right next to me?

1159
01:03:31,493 --> 01:03:33,403
- Right there.
- David, stop.

1160
01:03:33,478 --> 01:03:35,583
No, let me do this.
I don't know how or why,

1161
01:03:35,653 --> 01:03:37,857
but somehow I can see
your sister's spirit.

1162
01:03:37,926 --> 01:03:40,795
I know it's crazy,
but I also can talk to her.

1163
01:03:40,869 --> 01:03:44,131
So why don't I have her just
explain the whole thing to you,

1164
01:03:44,197 --> 01:03:45,441
and I'll translate.

1165
01:03:48,325 --> 01:03:50,431
Could you just hold on, just a sec?

1166
01:03:53,189 --> 01:03:56,189
OK, tea party's over.
Time for Wiggly Safari!

1167
01:03:56,261 --> 01:03:57,756
Yeah!

1168
01:03:58,309 --> 01:04:01,692
- OK, David, this could work.
- I think I was getting through to her.

1169
01:04:01,765 --> 01:04:05,027
- You need to get her to the hospital.
- Right to the hospital.

1170
01:04:05,093 --> 01:04:08,868
- We'll get her to rip those papers...
- Get the hell outta here, you freak!

1171
01:04:09,701 --> 01:04:12,036
I'm not makin' this up!
Why would I?

1172
01:04:12,101 --> 01:04:13,857
Abby, calm down,
just calm down!

1173
01:04:13,925 --> 01:04:16,129
I'll chop you!
I swear, I will chop you!

1174
01:04:16,197 --> 01:04:17,888
- Tell about J.J.
- I know about J.J.

1175
01:04:17,957 --> 01:04:20,378
- What?
- I know what you did with J.J.

1176
01:04:20,453 --> 01:04:22,908
I'll tell everybody.

1177
01:04:22,981 --> 01:04:24,989
How do you know that?
Nobody knows that!

1178
01:04:25,061 --> 01:04:26,949
Get outta here! Get going!

1179
01:04:33,317 --> 01:04:34,724
You kids OK?

1180
01:04:34,789 --> 01:04:39,066
Mommy, is Auntie Elizabeth
gonna have more tea?

1181
01:04:40,933 --> 01:04:42,209
What?

1182
01:04:55,141 --> 01:04:58,075
I don't think your sister's
a very spiritual person.

1183
01:04:58,149 --> 01:04:59,611
She's just bein' a good mom.

1184
01:04:59,685 --> 01:05:02,106
Tryin' to keep her kids away
from a crazy guy.

1185
01:05:06,597 --> 01:05:08,834
I think I would have liked
to have been a mom.

1186
01:05:08,901 --> 01:05:10,308
You'd make a good one.

1187
01:05:11,461 --> 01:05:12,443
Thanks.

1188
01:05:14,917 --> 01:05:16,478
Guess I'll never really know.

1189
01:05:16,549 --> 01:05:19,200
Come on, Lizzie. This can't be it.

1190
01:05:19,269 --> 01:05:21,179
- Lizzie?
- OK, I'm sorry.

1191
01:05:21,253 --> 01:05:23,292
I know you don't like
to be called that.

1192
01:05:23,365 --> 01:05:24,543
I'm warming up to it.

1193
01:05:25,861 --> 01:05:27,235
I can go to that hospital.

1194
01:05:27,301 --> 01:05:29,603
I could talk to your friend, Fran.
I could...

1195
01:05:29,669 --> 01:05:31,774
- No, David.
...talk to the asshole guy.

1196
01:05:31,845 --> 01:05:34,944
Brett? No. Just stop,
They'll put you in a straitjacket.

1197
01:05:35,013 --> 01:05:38,013
There's no way anyone's
gonna believe I'm still here.

1198
01:05:38,085 --> 01:05:40,223
Your niece, the little girl.
She saw you.

1199
01:05:40,293 --> 01:05:41,504
Oh, great.

1200
01:05:41,573 --> 01:05:43,711
My fate's in the hands
of a four-year-old

1201
01:05:43,781 --> 01:05:45,886
who has seven other
imaginary friends.

1202
01:05:46,853 --> 01:05:48,763
Wait. There is someone else.

1203
01:05:48,837 --> 01:05:50,179
What do you mean?

1204
01:05:50,245 --> 01:05:51,522
Come on.

1205
01:05:53,381 --> 01:05:55,007
- Darryl!
- Dude.

1206
01:05:55,077 --> 01:05:57,760
- Yeah.
- The spirit's with you, isn't it?

1207
01:05:57,829 --> 01:06:00,317
You can't bring that here.
What are you thinking, bro?

1208
01:06:00,389 --> 01:06:03,684
- You were right. She's alive.
- Righteous.

1209
01:06:03,749 --> 01:06:06,563
She's in a coma. Her family's
gonna take her off life support.

1210
01:06:06,629 --> 01:06:08,254
Not so righteous.

1211
01:06:08,325 --> 01:06:11,489
So, what, are you guys
socializing now?

1212
01:06:11,557 --> 01:06:14,427
We've... acclimated.

1213
01:06:14,501 --> 01:06:16,411
Yeah, I can tell.

1214
01:06:17,061 --> 01:06:21,917
In fact, I'm sensin' some pretty
intense feelings she has for you, bro.

1215
01:06:21,989 --> 01:06:24,738
- Really?
- No, I don't.

1216
01:06:24,805 --> 01:06:27,675
Major red aura.
Somebody's embarrassed.

1217
01:06:27,749 --> 01:06:30,531
- I am not. Can we focus here?
- OK.

1218
01:06:30,597 --> 01:06:33,892
- Ask him if there's a spell...
- Or a chant. Anything to get...

1219
01:06:33,957 --> 01:06:35,932
- My spirit...
...back into her body?

1220
01:06:36,005 --> 01:06:39,420
- You're asking the wrong question.
- Why is that wrong?

1221
01:06:40,549 --> 01:06:42,337
Look, I have the gift.

1222
01:06:42,405 --> 01:06:44,030
I didn't ask for it, but I do.

1223
01:06:44,101 --> 01:06:45,727
I can sense these things,

1224
01:06:45,797 --> 01:06:47,652
spirits, whatever
you wanna call 'em.

1225
01:06:47,717 --> 01:06:49,953
Why they're hangin' here
in the first place?

1226
01:06:50,021 --> 01:06:53,436
- That's their unfinished business.
- Do I have the gift?

1227
01:06:53,509 --> 01:06:56,543
Dude, please.
You definitely don't have it.

1228
01:06:56,613 --> 01:06:57,889
You're a civilian.

1229
01:06:57,957 --> 01:07:01,089
But if I don't have it,
how is it that I can see her

1230
01:07:01,157 --> 01:07:03,044
and talk to her
when no one else can?

1231
01:07:03,109 --> 01:07:05,859
- Exactly.
- Exactly what?

1232
01:07:05,925 --> 01:07:08,608
That's the right question.

1233
01:07:08,677 --> 01:07:10,848
What the hell is he talking about?

1234
01:07:10,917 --> 01:07:13,306
God, I feel like it's
right there in front of us.

1235
01:07:13,381 --> 01:07:15,039
I just can't get a handle on it.

1236
01:07:15,109 --> 01:07:18,425
How do you solve a problem
that isn't possible in the first place?

1237
01:07:18,501 --> 01:07:21,436
Because nothing seems
impossible to me anymore.

1238
01:07:21,509 --> 01:07:24,956
I mean, why did I move into
your apartment in the first place?

1239
01:07:25,029 --> 01:07:27,266
Why can I see you
when no one else can?

1240
01:07:27,333 --> 01:07:30,649
I mean, why was I down in that
restaurant when that guy collapsed?

1241
01:07:30,725 --> 01:07:33,856
It all seems interrelated somehow.

1242
01:07:33,925 --> 01:07:35,780
- What are you doing?
- I don't know.

1243
01:07:35,845 --> 01:07:38,529
I feel like I missed something here.
Wait a second.

1244
01:07:38,597 --> 01:07:41,314
Rosemary Preston lives
right here in San Francisco.

1245
01:07:41,381 --> 01:07:42,558
We could go talk to her.

1246
01:07:42,629 --> 01:07:44,995
I'll call Information,
maybe she's listed.

1247
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:46,238
Where did you get this?

1248
01:07:48,325 --> 01:07:50,235
It was just at the hospital.

1249
01:07:51,141 --> 01:07:53,377
Yeah. I...

1250
01:07:55,045 --> 01:07:56,387
I took it.

1251
01:07:57,797 --> 01:07:59,138
I'm sorry. I...

1252
01:07:59,205 --> 01:08:00,481
I just...

1253
01:08:00,549 --> 01:08:02,720
I wanted to have a picture of you.

1254
01:08:03,941 --> 01:08:06,527
I wasn't sure that I was
gonna ever see you again.

1255
01:08:06,597 --> 01:08:08,124
I'm sorry.

1256
01:08:09,508 --> 01:08:10,785
Don't be sorry.

1257
01:08:13,797 --> 01:08:15,259
That's really nice.

1258
01:08:16,869 --> 01:08:18,844
I really like that picture.

1259
01:08:19,877 --> 01:08:22,178
Yeah. Yeah, I liked it too.

1260
01:08:23,461 --> 01:08:26,079
I had just gotten
my MOAT scores back.

1261
01:08:26,149 --> 01:08:28,189
Well, you must've done well.

1262
01:08:28,261 --> 01:08:31,522
No, actually, I bombed.
My scores were so low

1263
01:08:31,588 --> 01:08:34,141
I couldn't even get into
correspondence school.

1264
01:08:34,212 --> 01:08:36,416
- And that's a good thing?
- No.

1265
01:08:36,485 --> 01:08:39,649
I know it sounds kind a crazy.
I wanted to go back to the library

1266
01:08:39,717 --> 01:08:42,335
and start studying immediately,
but Abby said no.

1267
01:08:42,405 --> 01:08:44,576
The only thing to do
was to burn my scores

1268
01:08:44,645 --> 01:08:46,619
and drink margaritas.

1269
01:08:47,525 --> 01:08:49,434
Lots and lots of margaritas.

1270
01:08:49,509 --> 01:08:51,997
Well, looks like she was right.

1271
01:08:52,069 --> 01:08:57,251
It's just funny because the one time
I completely failed at something,

1272
01:08:57,317 --> 01:08:59,553
I had more fun
than I'd ever had in my life.

1273
01:09:01,285 --> 01:09:02,878
You look happy.

1274
01:09:05,061 --> 01:09:06,654
I was happy.

1275
01:09:07,877 --> 01:09:10,430
But what was I doing
with the rest of my time?

1276
01:09:10,501 --> 01:09:13,021
When I think about my life and I...

1277
01:09:14,277 --> 01:09:16,132
All I can remember is working.

1278
01:09:17,412 --> 01:09:19,517
You know? Working and working

1279
01:09:19,588 --> 01:09:22,239
and trying so hard.

1280
01:09:22,309 --> 01:09:24,098
And for what?

1281
01:09:24,165 --> 01:09:26,140
You help people.

1282
01:09:27,012 --> 01:09:28,419
You save lives.

1283
01:09:28,484 --> 01:09:30,972
Yeah. Including my own.

1284
01:09:31,045 --> 01:09:33,980
I saved my life, for later.

1285
01:09:36,549 --> 01:09:38,207
I just...

1286
01:09:38,277 --> 01:09:40,895
I never thought
there wouldn't be a later.

1287
01:09:40,964 --> 01:09:43,353
No, don't say that.
There's still time.

1288
01:09:43,429 --> 01:09:44,923
We're gonna see this lady...

1289
01:09:44,997 --> 01:09:48,194
You know, I just don't want
to spend my last night crying.

1290
01:09:48,901 --> 01:09:51,453
Or... fighting my fate.

1291
01:09:52,709 --> 01:09:55,098
I wanna do something with you.

1292
01:09:57,669 --> 01:10:00,287
OK. OK, great.

1293
01:10:00,357 --> 01:10:01,568
What do you want to do?

1294
01:10:01,637 --> 01:10:03,043
You want to fly to Paris?

1295
01:10:03,109 --> 01:10:05,083
See the Eiffel Tower? No problem.

1296
01:10:05,157 --> 01:10:08,027
You wanna dance on a beach
in Bali? Let's go! Let's do it!

1297
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:09,246
Anywhere in the world

1298
01:10:09,317 --> 01:10:12,186
that will take MasterCard or Visa.

1299
01:10:12,261 --> 01:10:13,537
Anywhere.

1300
01:10:15,653 --> 01:10:17,889
There is something
that I would like to do.

1301
01:10:19,301 --> 01:10:20,643
Anything.

1302
01:10:22,309 --> 01:10:23,650
I'm so bad at this.

1303
01:10:24,516 --> 01:10:26,011
What? What is it?

1304
01:10:35,172 --> 01:10:36,765
Are you nervous?

1305
01:10:38,437 --> 01:10:40,925
- A little.
- Why?

1306
01:10:40,997 --> 01:10:42,338
I don't know.

1307
01:10:43,685 --> 01:10:47,459
How can you be nervous
when I can't even touch you?

1308
01:10:47,525 --> 01:10:51,299
I think I'm more nervous
because you can't touch me.

1309
01:10:52,037 --> 01:10:53,313
Why?

1310
01:10:55,236 --> 01:10:58,270
You know in the hospital
when you touched my hand?

1311
01:10:59,141 --> 01:11:00,995
I felt it.

1312
01:11:01,061 --> 01:11:04,257
I mean, my spirit felt it.

1313
01:11:04,325 --> 01:11:06,235
I don't know how.

1314
01:11:07,941 --> 01:11:10,788
But I think if you could
ever really touch me...

1315
01:11:12,741 --> 01:11:14,912
...I might wake up from all of this.

1316
01:11:32,197 --> 01:11:34,564
I can almost feel that.

1317
01:11:34,629 --> 01:11:35,905
Me too.

1318
01:11:37,572 --> 01:11:40,125
I think I know what
my unfinished business is.

1319
01:11:40,197 --> 01:11:41,571
What?

1320
01:11:43,396 --> 01:11:44,923
You.

1321
01:12:08,933 --> 01:12:10,340
Elizabeth.

1322
01:12:11,749 --> 01:12:13,374
Elizabeth?

1323
01:12:13,445 --> 01:12:15,812
- Elizabeth?!
- I'm right here.

1324
01:12:15,876 --> 01:12:18,265
Oh, good, good.
I thought you were gone.

1325
01:12:18,341 --> 01:12:20,228
Suddenly I know
what I'm supposed to do,

1326
01:12:20,293 --> 01:12:22,049
because this time
I can do something.

1327
01:12:22,117 --> 01:12:23,677
What are you talking about?

1328
01:12:23,749 --> 01:12:27,295
Lizzie, when we first met,
I kept saying that you were dead.

1329
01:12:27,365 --> 01:12:29,983
But it was me that was dead,
and you brought me back.

1330
01:12:30,053 --> 01:12:32,158
You saved me.

1331
01:12:32,229 --> 01:12:33,920
And now it's my turn to save you.

1332
01:12:33,989 --> 01:12:35,549
How?

1333
01:12:35,621 --> 01:12:37,628
I'm gonna steal your body.

1334
01:12:39,365 --> 01:12:40,892
David.

1335
01:12:40,965 --> 01:12:44,642
David. David, what are you thinking?
You can't do this!

1336
01:12:44,709 --> 01:12:46,913
- Why can't I?
- Because you'll go to jail.

1337
01:12:46,981 --> 01:12:50,079
So? If something happens to you,
you think I care where I'll be?

1338
01:12:50,149 --> 01:12:52,832
At least this'll buy us
a little more time.

1339
01:12:54,020 --> 01:12:57,184
The things you'd have to know
to even start to pull this off...

1340
01:12:57,252 --> 01:12:59,423
You know them.
You'll talk me through it.

1341
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:02,558
OK, you're gonna need a van.

1342
01:13:02,629 --> 01:13:05,312
And somebody with no morals.

1343
01:13:13,188 --> 01:13:15,610
- What are we movin' again?
- Medical supplies.

1344
01:13:15,685 --> 01:13:17,692
You didn't tell him? You have to.

1345
01:13:17,765 --> 01:13:19,674
You know,
he looks really familiar to me.

1346
01:13:19,748 --> 01:13:22,432
- You saw him at the bar.
- Saw who at the bar?

1347
01:13:22,501 --> 01:13:24,192
No one, never mind.
Here we go!

1348
01:13:26,149 --> 01:13:29,465
OK, and we're in such a hurry
to move this stuff because why?

1349
01:13:29,540 --> 01:13:32,737
There's a one-day sale on
hospital beds. I always wanted one.

1350
01:13:32,805 --> 01:13:35,292
Oh, great. Now you're
gonna become a bed potato.

1351
01:13:35,364 --> 01:13:37,568
- You've gotta tell this poor guy.
- Not yet.

1352
01:13:37,636 --> 01:13:39,491
- Not yet what?
- We're not there yet.

1353
01:13:39,556 --> 01:13:41,411
OK, Dave, be honest with me.

1354
01:13:41,476 --> 01:13:43,964
Has your imaginary friend
come out to play?

1355
01:13:51,397 --> 01:13:52,923
OK, grab a cart.

1356
01:13:52,996 --> 01:13:55,811
You need a blood pressure cuff

1357
01:13:55,876 --> 01:13:59,138
and a portable ventilator,
right there, that yellow thing.

1358
01:13:59,204 --> 01:14:02,401
Dave, what the hell are you doing?
This isn't a sale, man!

1359
01:14:02,469 --> 01:14:04,738
All right. I knew
you wouldn't come if I told you.

1360
01:14:04,805 --> 01:14:08,515
- Do I really want to hear this?
- My imaginary friend is not imaginary.

1361
01:14:08,581 --> 01:14:11,232
She is the spirit of a girl
in a coma upstairs

1362
01:14:11,301 --> 01:14:13,537
who they're about
to take off life support.

1363
01:14:13,604 --> 01:14:15,360
We've got to get her someplace safe.

1364
01:14:15,428 --> 01:14:16,803
- Really?
- Really.

1365
01:14:16,869 --> 01:14:19,618
- You should've told him.
- He wouldn't have believed me.

1366
01:14:19,684 --> 01:14:22,684
- Does he believe you now?
- I had to get him into the hospital!

1367
01:14:22,756 --> 01:14:26,018
Let me take you to the psych ward.
There are people who can help!

1368
01:14:26,084 --> 01:14:29,946
No time. It's 11:30 right now.
She's gonna be dead in half an hour!

1369
01:14:30,020 --> 01:14:31,678
Tell him I know this is a stretch.

1370
01:14:31,748 --> 01:14:34,814
Elizabeth is standing
right behind you right now.

1371
01:14:34,884 --> 01:14:36,892
She knows what a stretch
this is for you.

1372
01:14:36,964 --> 01:14:38,819
If your friend's really behind me,

1373
01:14:38,884 --> 01:14:41,503
ask her what I'm doing:
Rock, paper or scissors?

1374
01:14:41,573 --> 01:14:43,034
- Rock.
- Rock.

1375
01:14:43,845 --> 01:14:45,219
- Scissors.
- Scissors.

1376
01:14:45,956 --> 01:14:47,004
- Paper.
- Paper.

1377
01:14:47,749 --> 01:14:49,724
- Rock again.
- Rock again.

1378
01:14:49,796 --> 01:14:52,349
- He's flipping me off.
- Are you flipping her off?

1379
01:14:52,420 --> 01:14:55,071
- You're flipping her off!
- How...?

1380
01:14:55,140 --> 01:14:57,693
OK. OK, sometimes
people with emotional

1381
01:14:57,764 --> 01:15:00,634
and mental disturbances
can have psychic moments.

1382
01:15:00,708 --> 01:15:01,952
But even if she was real,

1383
01:15:02,020 --> 01:15:04,409
do you know what you're
risking for this woman?

1384
01:15:04,484 --> 01:15:05,728
- Yes!
- Why?

1385
01:15:07,557 --> 01:15:08,931
Because I love her.

1386
01:15:09,925 --> 01:15:11,583
I love her.

1387
01:15:11,652 --> 01:15:13,245
I do, I love you.

1388
01:15:14,469 --> 01:15:16,836
No one's ever said that to me before.

1389
01:15:23,365 --> 01:15:24,575
- David?
- What?

1390
01:15:24,644 --> 01:15:27,327
- Tell him thank you.
- We're really grateful, Jack.

1391
01:15:27,397 --> 01:15:28,640
I'm not doin' it for you.

1392
01:15:28,709 --> 01:15:30,018
Then why are you doing it?

1393
01:15:30,085 --> 01:15:33,249
Because someday, trust me,
I'm gonna need help movin' a body.

1394
01:15:33,317 --> 01:15:36,251
When that day comes,
I don't wanna hear any shit from you.

1395
01:15:39,237 --> 01:15:41,309
OK, get me on the gurney, quick.

1396
01:15:41,380 --> 01:15:42,689
Oh, my God. David.

1397
01:15:42,757 --> 01:15:44,251
I know. She's pretty, right?

1398
01:15:44,325 --> 01:15:46,430
That's really sweet,
but we've gotta go.

1399
01:15:46,501 --> 01:15:48,323
No, that's not it. This is her.

1400
01:15:48,388 --> 01:15:51,966
This is the woman I set you up with,
the woman you stood up that night!

1401
01:15:52,580 --> 01:15:54,009
I was gonna meet Elizabeth?

1402
01:15:54,085 --> 01:15:57,281
And she didn't make it either,
because she had an accident.

1403
01:15:58,308 --> 01:15:59,486
It was you.

1404
01:15:59,556 --> 01:16:01,083
Is that it? Is that why?

1405
01:16:01,157 --> 01:16:02,750
I was supposed to meet you.

1406
01:16:03,812 --> 01:16:04,892
How did you know her?

1407
01:16:04,964 --> 01:16:07,233
I'm friends with her sister.
We went out.

1408
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:11,556
- I knew I'd seen him. That's J.J.!
- Jack is J.J.?

1409
01:16:11,621 --> 01:16:14,370
What did you...?
No one's called me J.J. Since college.

1410
01:16:14,437 --> 01:16:16,346
He's older and hairier, but it's him.

1411
01:16:16,421 --> 01:16:18,526
The one who tongued Abby
at the wedding?

1412
01:16:18,597 --> 01:16:21,466
- How the hell did you know that?
- It's Elizabeth.

1413
01:16:21,540 --> 01:16:24,737
- Oh, my God. She really is here.
- I told you!

1414
01:16:24,805 --> 01:16:28,733
Get her on the gurney! I don't want them
killing Abby's sister! Come on.

1415
01:16:28,805 --> 01:16:30,049
OK. Be really gentle.

1416
01:16:31,396 --> 01:16:32,825
Yeah.

1417
01:16:32,900 --> 01:16:34,176
I'm here already.

1418
01:16:34,245 --> 01:16:36,284
- That's Brett.
- He's 15 minutes early!

1419
01:16:36,356 --> 01:16:39,204
- Soon as the sister shows, we're ready.
- He's comin' in.

1420
01:16:39,268 --> 01:16:40,795
That's OK. All right.

1421
01:16:40,869 --> 01:16:43,356
- Careful, he's smart. His name is...
- Dr. Rushton?

1422
01:16:43,428 --> 01:16:45,567
- Yeah.
- Well, hi, David Abbott.

1423
01:16:45,636 --> 01:16:47,676
Buy some time.
Tell him you're a doctor.

1424
01:16:47,749 --> 01:16:48,926
I'm a doctor.

1425
01:16:48,996 --> 01:16:51,418
You're a special consultant
from PAO Medical.

1426
01:16:51,492 --> 01:16:53,794
I'm a special consultant
from PAO Medical.

1427
01:16:53,861 --> 01:16:56,316
Dr. Walsh sent me down
for a final evaluation.

1428
01:16:56,389 --> 01:16:59,869
I had no verbal or written
instructions to that end.

1429
01:16:59,940 --> 01:17:02,493
There's new evidence
to support that full...

1430
01:17:02,564 --> 01:17:06,110
Functionality can be restored.
We need to run some tests.

1431
01:17:06,181 --> 01:17:07,555
Who's we?

1432
01:17:07,620 --> 01:17:09,530
Tell him your team is downstairs.

1433
01:17:09,604 --> 01:17:12,736
My team is downstairs with
a signed order from Dr. Walsh.

1434
01:17:12,805 --> 01:17:15,423
- You got it.
- This is the first I've heard of this.

1435
01:17:15,492 --> 01:17:17,347
You won't mind
if I talk to Dr. Walsh?

1436
01:17:17,412 --> 01:17:19,648
Go confirm with him.
We'll wait right here.

1437
01:17:19,716 --> 01:17:21,407
I'll just get him on the phone.

1438
01:17:24,164 --> 01:17:26,881
- David!
- OK, I'm not convincing as a doctor!

1439
01:17:26,949 --> 01:17:29,567
Oh, God, David,
the felonies just keep pilin' up!

1440
01:17:29,637 --> 01:17:31,425
- That way, David.
- Go this way.

1441
01:17:32,580 --> 01:17:34,173
- Brett!
- What happened?

1442
01:17:34,244 --> 01:17:35,553
Are you OK?

1443
01:17:35,620 --> 01:17:38,490
This is Dr. Rushton.
I need security on the third floor.

1444
01:17:38,564 --> 01:17:41,434
Don't jostle. But go faster.

1445
01:17:41,509 --> 01:17:44,411
- Take a right up here.
- Right here! Right, right, right!

1446
01:17:47,717 --> 01:17:48,993
The elevator!

1447
01:17:50,245 --> 01:17:52,154
Hold it! We need you to...

1448
01:17:58,692 --> 01:18:00,350
Oh, shit.

1449
01:18:01,700 --> 01:18:04,188
Stop right there!
Stop! Stop! Stop! Hold it!

1450
01:18:04,260 --> 01:18:06,169
Come on! Hey, hey, hey!

1451
01:18:08,037 --> 01:18:09,182
- David.
- Elizabeth.

1452
01:18:09,252 --> 01:18:11,619
Oh, my God, David.
My breathing tube is gone.

1453
01:18:11,684 --> 01:18:13,571
What? No!

1454
01:18:13,637 --> 01:18:16,833
- Well, what can I do?
- It's too late. It's happening.

1455
01:18:16,900 --> 01:18:18,689
- No.
- It's strong.

1456
01:18:18,756 --> 01:18:19,934
Be stronger.

1457
01:18:20,005 --> 01:18:21,531
It's pulling me away.

1458
01:18:21,604 --> 01:18:22,979
No!

1459
01:18:23,045 --> 01:18:24,452
Stay with me!

1460
01:18:34,020 --> 01:18:36,191
- I got ya.
- Elizabeth!

1461
01:18:36,260 --> 01:18:38,170
- No!
- David.

1462
01:18:38,245 --> 01:18:39,968
- Give me a sedative!
- Help her!

1463
01:18:40,036 --> 01:18:42,338
- Gimme five of Haldol.
- Help her! Elizabeth!

1464
01:18:42,404 --> 01:18:44,738
- Hold him.
- No! Elizabeth!

1465
01:18:54,436 --> 01:18:55,680
What's going on?

1466
01:18:55,748 --> 01:18:57,603
- That's not possible.
- Yeah.

1467
01:18:57,668 --> 01:18:59,577
That's not possible.

1468
01:19:02,564 --> 01:19:05,880
Elizabeth? Can you hear me?

1469
01:19:05,956 --> 01:19:08,989
I can't believe
we almost let you go.

1470
01:19:09,060 --> 01:19:11,711
Honey? It's me, Abby.

1471
01:19:11,780 --> 01:19:14,268
- Abby.
- Yeah.

1472
01:19:19,204 --> 01:19:20,928
I think I bumped my head.

1473
01:19:25,156 --> 01:19:26,563
It's OK.

1474
01:19:37,956 --> 01:19:39,036
Hey.

1475
01:19:40,324 --> 01:19:41,601
Hello.

1476
01:19:43,012 --> 01:19:44,354
It's me.

1477
01:19:44,420 --> 01:19:46,809
I'm sorry, I don't...

1478
01:19:47,780 --> 01:19:51,041
Honey, it's David.
You don't remember David?

1479
01:19:53,700 --> 01:19:55,042
The apartment.

1480
01:19:56,132 --> 01:19:57,659
The rooftop.

1481
01:19:57,732 --> 01:19:59,008
Garden.

1482
01:20:00,676 --> 01:20:01,886
Nothin'.

1483
01:20:15,076 --> 01:20:17,629
Honey, you don't
remember him at all?

1484
01:21:20,580 --> 01:21:22,882
- Aunt Elizabeth, come on!
- Come on!

1485
01:22:44,772 --> 01:22:46,910
We only rented it for a month.

1486
01:22:46,980 --> 01:22:49,369
- Did you move something?
- No.

1487
01:22:52,676 --> 01:22:55,043
It's funny, I just have
this strange feeling,

1488
01:22:55,108 --> 01:22:57,377
like... something's missing.

1489
01:22:57,444 --> 01:22:59,517
Everything's here, just as you left it.

1490
01:23:01,988 --> 01:23:03,712
I guess it's just been a long time.

1491
01:23:04,612 --> 01:23:06,106
You sure you're gonna be OK?

1492
01:23:06,180 --> 01:23:07,554
Yeah. I'm gonna be good.

1493
01:23:07,620 --> 01:23:11,002
- So I'll see you guys Saturday.
- OK. The girls'll bake for you.

1494
01:24:34,724 --> 01:24:36,000
Hi.

1495
01:24:40,292 --> 01:24:41,633
Don't worry, I'm...

1496
01:24:42,916 --> 01:24:45,152
I just wanted you
to have your garden.

1497
01:24:49,892 --> 01:24:51,266
How did you get up here?

1498
01:24:52,707 --> 01:24:56,286
Spare key.
Under the fire extinguisher.

1499
01:25:02,148 --> 01:25:04,669
Look, the last thing
I want to do is scare you.

1500
01:25:06,564 --> 01:25:07,709
Goodbye, Lizzie.

1501
01:25:12,292 --> 01:25:13,307
Wait.

1502
01:25:16,420 --> 01:25:17,980
Yeah?

1503
01:25:22,404 --> 01:25:24,314
The key. I need the key back.

1504
01:25:24,387 --> 01:25:26,297
Oh, right.

1505
01:25:34,756 --> 01:25:36,446
How do I know you?

1506
01:25:37,252 --> 01:25:39,074
Maybe from your dreams.

1507
01:25:46,084 --> 01:25:48,156
If you could ever really touch me,

1508
01:25:48,228 --> 01:25:50,203
I might wake up from all of this.

1509
01:25:52,356 --> 01:25:53,698
It wasn't a dream.

1510
01:25:53,764 --> 01:25:55,225
No.

1511
01:26:07,460 --> 01:26:08,475
David.

1512
01:26:08,547 --> 01:26:10,914
Yeah. Yeah.

1513
01:26:37,572 --> 01:26:39,873
Righteous.

1514
01:26:39,874 --> 01:27:40,874
