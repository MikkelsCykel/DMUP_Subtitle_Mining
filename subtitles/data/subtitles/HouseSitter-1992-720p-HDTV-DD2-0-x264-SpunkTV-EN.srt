1
00:02:13,149 --> 00:02:16,349
Where are you taking me?
Where am I?

2
00:02:16,429 --> 00:02:18,549
- I don't know. I'm blindfolded too.
- Davis!

3
00:02:18,629 --> 00:02:21,389
- I'm just kidding. We're almost there.
- Almost where?

4
00:02:21,469 --> 00:02:23,429
You are so nuts!

5
00:02:40,909 --> 00:02:43,189
We're here.

6
00:02:54,389 --> 00:02:57,430
What is this?

7
00:02:57,469 --> 00:03:00,909
- Will you marry me?
- What?

8
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:03,749
Becky, I have loved you
since the 9th grade. Marry me.

9
00:03:05,309 --> 00:03:07,149
You bought this house?

10
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:09,069
Bought it?
I'm an architect!

11
00:03:09,149 --> 00:03:11,309
I designed it!
I built it!

12
00:03:11,349 --> 00:03:15,029
You built this house...
for me?

13
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:17,669
For us.

14
00:03:17,749 --> 00:03:21,430
- You are so nuts!
- And you are so sane. It's perfect!

15
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:24,189
This is like something
out of a fairy tale.

16
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:26,269
So, will you?

17
00:03:26,309 --> 00:03:29,269
No.

18
00:03:42,469 --> 00:03:46,629
I now dedicate this building
to the great city of Boston.

19
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:49,589
Bravo.

20
00:03:49,669 --> 00:03:52,749
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, thank you.

21
00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:54,669
Thank you so much.

22
00:03:54,749 --> 00:03:57,389
Thank you, Frank.

23
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:03,629
Gentlemen, welcome to the Budapest.

24
00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:05,949
Drink up.
Everybody, more champagne.

25
00:04:06,029 --> 00:04:09,589
Welcome to the Budapest.
Haven't seen you in a long time.

26
00:04:09,629 --> 00:04:12,909
Welcome to the Budapest.
Have a great time.

27
00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:25,070
Ah, Mr. Moseby, welcome
to The Cafe Budapest.

28
00:04:25,149 --> 00:04:29,309
I still think it's a boring building,
no matter how you look at it.

29
00:04:29,389 --> 00:04:33,269
The absolute best thing about this
building, in two words, "billable hours."

30
00:04:33,349 --> 00:04:35,589
- But did you enjoy doing it? Whoa.
- That didn't factor in.

31
00:04:35,669 --> 00:04:37,550
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Okay, okay.

32
00:04:37,589 --> 00:04:39,509
- Where are you from?
- Eh?

33
00:04:39,589 --> 00:04:41,429
Where are you from?

34
00:04:41,509 --> 00:04:44,189
- Are you from Hungary?
- Yes, Hungary.

35
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:46,629
- He wants to know if you speak English.
- Uh?

36
00:04:46,669 --> 00:04:48,909
- He said,
"Are you ticklish? Do you spank?"

37
00:04:48,909 --> 00:04:49,350
Marty!

38
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,270
Gwen is
to be called Gwen.

39
00:04:51,309 --> 00:04:54,189
Go, go, go. Work, work, work.

40
00:04:54,229 --> 00:04:56,709
Enjoy the party, gentlemen.
Enjoy the party.

41
00:04:56,789 --> 00:04:58,829
- She liked you.
- What are you talking about?

42
00:04:58,909 --> 00:05:02,110
She could have liked you.
You just gotta make it happen, Davis.

43
00:05:02,189 --> 00:05:05,269
- Hi, Davis.
- Hi, Mr. Calvin.

44
00:05:05,349 --> 00:05:07,189
Becky is over.
That was months ago.

45
00:05:07,269 --> 00:05:09,629
- You've gotta find a way to transcend.
- Yeah, but how?

46
00:05:09,669 --> 00:05:13,389
- Get laid.
- Marty, you're my most disgusting friend.

47
00:05:13,429 --> 00:05:15,869
How about Denise?
What about Patricia?

48
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:18,430
- I know she had the hots for you.
- What are the hots?

49
00:05:18,469 --> 00:05:22,270
Moseby, eleven o'clock.

50
00:05:22,349 --> 00:05:25,749
Hi, Mr. Moseby. Congratulations
on another beautiful job.

51
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:28,909
- Thank you, Marty.
Everyone has a right to feel proud.

52
00:05:28,909 --> 00:05:29,670
Absolutely.

53
00:05:29,749 --> 00:05:32,509
I don't know if it's the champagne
talking or not, but I wanna say,

54
00:05:32,589 --> 00:05:36,069
your leadership has been an inspiration
to all of us on the project.

55
00:05:36,149 --> 00:05:38,109
- I hope I've not embarrassed you.
- Not at all.

56
00:05:38,189 --> 00:05:40,389
- Mr. Moseby, congratulations.
Very good job.

57
00:05:40,389 --> 00:05:41,429
Charlie, thank you.

58
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:44,509
- I don't know if you know Davis
from the firm?

59
00:05:44,509 --> 00:05:45,069
Davis.

60
00:05:45,109 --> 00:05:48,389
Mr. Moseby.
Uh, the building...

61
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:50,309
Wow!
It's there.

62
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:53,069
Yes?

63
00:05:53,149 --> 00:05:57,589
Uh, you know that Boston Bank building
you designed years ago?

64
00:05:57,669 --> 00:06:00,909
I've stood on the sidewalk
for hours absorbing that structure.

65
00:06:00,909 --> 00:06:03,229
- It still surprises me.
- Thank you, Davis.

66
00:06:03,269 --> 00:06:06,389
Don't you think we should be going
for that kind of originality...

67
00:06:06,469 --> 00:06:08,589
instead of these same designs
over and over,

68
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,669
this cookie-cutter
architecture?

69
00:06:10,749 --> 00:06:12,989
Don't you feel we're just
going through the motions?

70
00:06:13,069 --> 00:06:16,429
We are the largest
architectural firm in New England.

71
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:20,509
Evidently some people
like what we do.

72
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:25,349
Are you insane?

73
00:06:25,429 --> 00:06:28,389
Why didn't you kick him in the balls
and tell him he has ugly children?

74
00:06:28,469 --> 00:06:31,269
I thought he'd appreciate
a fresh point of view.

75
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:33,709
Why would you think that?
He's the boss!

76
00:06:33,789 --> 00:06:36,789
If I could find the right doctor,
I'd have my lips sewn to his ass.

77
00:06:36,869 --> 00:06:38,069
We're different.

78
00:06:38,069 --> 00:06:41,029
- Yes. Come Monday,
I will still have a job.

79
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,989
Hi, Mr. Simpson.

80
00:07:00,709 --> 00:07:04,189
Is Gwen, yes? I remember
beautiful Gwen from Hungary...

81
00:07:04,729 --> 00:07:07,850
That is a drawing of
an engagement ring,

82
00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:10,689
which I designed
and even built.

83
00:07:10,769 --> 00:07:14,129
But, as engagement rings go,
it turned out to be a little, you know,

84
00:07:14,209 --> 00:07:16,809
"big" for the lady.

85
00:07:16,889 --> 00:07:20,729
What do you say, Gwen?
"Gwhen" do you get off...

86
00:07:20,809 --> 00:07:22,769
and "gwhere" can we "gwo"?

87
00:07:22,849 --> 00:07:24,889
- Oh God.
- Good night, kiddo.

88
00:07:24,969 --> 00:07:27,369
- Good night.
- I'll take care of opening tomorrow.

89
00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:29,369
Oh, you will?
I can sleep.

90
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,729
- Oh, I love you.
- No sweat.

91
00:07:31,809 --> 00:07:35,089
Cíao.

92
00:07:35,129 --> 00:07:37,089
- Hey, guys!
- Hey, Gwen.

93
00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:41,009
Come on, chop-chop.
Let's get home.

94
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:43,889
Taxi!

95
00:07:46,849 --> 00:07:49,649
Good night, little Howie.

96
00:07:51,049 --> 00:07:53,889
Hey,
you tricked me.

97
00:07:53,929 --> 00:07:56,690
Why were you pretending
to be Hungarian?

98
00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:00,049
- Ambience.
- Ambience, yeah. But you still tricked me.

99
00:08:00,129 --> 00:08:03,289
- I didn't trick you. I deceived you.
- What's the difference?

100
00:08:03,369 --> 00:08:05,730
- Intention.
- Intention?

101
00:08:05,769 --> 00:08:08,689
- Are you a law student or something?
- Hey!

102
00:08:08,769 --> 00:08:11,889
I guessed it? You're a law student?
Where do you go to school?

103
00:08:11,929 --> 00:08:15,289
Don't you mean
"gwhere" do I go to school?

104
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:19,049
I, I admit, I was
a little condescending.

105
00:08:19,129 --> 00:08:22,129
Yeah, when you thought
I was just a waitress.

106
00:08:22,209 --> 00:08:25,809
- I'm sorry. I apologize.
- I'm not a law student.

107
00:08:25,889 --> 00:08:28,689
Why'd you tell me
you were a law student?

108
00:08:28,729 --> 00:08:33,850
I didn't. You told me I was a law student.
I just told you I wasn't a law student.

109
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:39,249
Listen!

110
00:08:39,329 --> 00:08:41,889
Listen, can...
can we go somewhere?

111
00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:44,209
- Get coffee or something?
- No, I really have to get home.

112
00:08:44,289 --> 00:08:47,169
Share my cab.
I could give you a lift.

113
00:08:47,209 --> 00:08:50,049
Thank you very much,
but it's real close.

114
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:52,129
I'll walk you.
I could use some air.

115
00:08:59,729 --> 00:09:02,209
Okay.

116
00:09:06,009 --> 00:09:09,209
There's all these cities
I want to live in before I die,

117
00:09:09,209 --> 00:09:11,009
and Boston happened to be one.

118
00:09:11,089 --> 00:09:13,249
There's New York, which is
where I came up here from.

119
00:09:13,289 --> 00:09:17,049
Before that there was Seattle, San
Francisco, Santa Fe, New Orleans,

120
00:09:17,129 --> 00:09:18,969
- Akron.
- Akron?

121
00:09:19,049 --> 00:09:21,529
Yeah, well...
It was a detour, you know.

122
00:09:21,569 --> 00:09:23,409
But I lived there
so I count it.

123
00:09:23,489 --> 00:09:25,570
Before that, there was
Toledo, where I grew up.

124
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:29,049
- Gosh, I've never lived anywhere.
- How can you never live anywhere?

125
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:31,969
Well, just here
and Dobb's Mill.

126
00:09:32,049 --> 00:09:34,369
That's where I grew up.
It's about 50 miles from here.

127
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:36,529
It's one of those
white-picket-fence sort of towns,

128
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:39,449
with your basic church steeple,
town square,

129
00:09:39,529 --> 00:09:41,569
and big firemen's
pancake breakfasts.

130
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:43,810
All the kids
grew up together.

131
00:09:43,889 --> 00:09:47,449
And everybody knows you,
you know what I mean?

132
00:09:47,529 --> 00:09:50,809
- Sure. So is that where she's from?
- Who?

133
00:09:50,889 --> 00:09:53,369
The babe who thought the house
was too big for her finger.

134
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:55,929
Oh, Becky.
No, no, that's over.

135
00:09:55,969 --> 00:09:58,609
I bet you still have
her picture in your wallet.

136
00:09:58,689 --> 00:10:00,889
- Get outta there. Get outta my...
- C'mon, let me see.

137
00:10:00,929 --> 00:10:03,249
Hey, you knocked me
into the water there.

138
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:06,170
- Who cares about wallet photos?
- You could go to jail for this.

139
00:10:06,209 --> 00:10:08,129
No, that's her
in the 6th grade.

140
00:10:08,209 --> 00:10:11,089
I got a more up-to-date.
Let's see, 7th grade, 8th grade, 9th...

141
00:10:11,169 --> 00:10:15,169
Let me just jump ahead.
That's Becky, but it's over, believe me.

142
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:18,049
Did you see that picture?
Was she a cute baby?

143
00:10:18,129 --> 00:10:20,089
Is that funny?
Anyway...

144
00:10:20,129 --> 00:10:23,329
Here's her driver's license.
She was gonna throw this away.

145
00:10:23,409 --> 00:10:26,209
I said, "Are you crazy?
That's a cute picture."

146
00:10:26,249 --> 00:10:29,409
Anyway, I don't even
go up there anymore.

147
00:10:29,449 --> 00:10:31,810
I probably should take the
ribbon off the house, right?

148
00:10:31,849 --> 00:10:34,970
You mean you still own it
and nobody's living in it?

149
00:10:35,049 --> 00:10:38,209
Yeah, it's a waste, huh?
It's just so nice up there,

150
00:10:38,289 --> 00:10:41,249
especially this time of the year
with the leaves changing.

151
00:10:41,329 --> 00:10:45,209
And it's got this wraparound porch
that looks onto a pond.

152
00:10:45,289 --> 00:10:48,569
And in the living room, it's got these
switchback stairs that go up to a loft.

153
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:51,649
Sorry, I still get
a little excited about it.

154
00:10:51,689 --> 00:10:53,769
I mean,
I don't use it, but...

155
00:10:53,849 --> 00:10:57,369
- But what?
- I just can't bring myself to sell it.

156
00:10:57,409 --> 00:11:00,369
It's like I'm stuck where I am,
like I can't change it.

157
00:11:00,449 --> 00:11:02,289
- Did you ever feel like that?
- No.

158
00:11:02,369 --> 00:11:05,409
- No?
- No, I...

159
00:11:05,489 --> 00:11:07,569
I change myself
all the time.

160
00:11:07,649 --> 00:11:11,129
If things aren't workin' out,
I change what I do, change where I live,

161
00:11:11,209 --> 00:11:12,249
I change myself.

162
00:11:12,249 --> 00:11:15,609
- You're Hungarian one minute
and a law student the next.

163
00:11:15,689 --> 00:11:18,849
Ooh! This is fabulous!
Oh, I love it.

164
00:11:18,889 --> 00:11:20,769
We're back where
we started from.

165
00:11:20,809 --> 00:11:26,209
Ooh, yeah, it's where I live,
above the restaurant.

166
00:11:26,249 --> 00:11:28,369
I told you it was close
but you said you wanted some air,

167
00:11:28,449 --> 00:11:31,009
so we went for a walk.

168
00:11:35,129 --> 00:11:37,009
Listen.

169
00:11:39,249 --> 00:11:41,169
Could I use your phone
to call a cab?

170
00:11:41,249 --> 00:11:43,169
- Do you mind?
- Sure, why not.

171
00:11:43,249 --> 00:11:45,249
Good night, Ralph.
Good night, Mary.

172
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,449
Hello!

173
00:11:51,369 --> 00:11:54,690
In return for waitressing,
I get to live here rent free,

174
00:11:54,729 --> 00:11:57,249
which actually works out
really well for him in taxes,

175
00:11:57,329 --> 00:12:00,289
and then what I earn is the tips,
which is really great.

176
00:12:00,369 --> 00:12:04,689
You'd be surprised how well you can do,
particularly with that Hungarian thing.

177
00:12:04,769 --> 00:12:07,529
Your lock's busted.

178
00:12:07,609 --> 00:12:11,049
Yeah, I know. I've been
raggin' on Karol about that.

179
00:12:11,129 --> 00:12:13,210
- Who's she?
- He.

180
00:12:13,289 --> 00:12:15,529
He's the guy who
owns the Budapest.

181
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:17,449
Funny name for a guy.

182
00:12:17,489 --> 00:12:20,689
Yeah, it is.

183
00:12:20,769 --> 00:12:23,849
- Newt.
- Huh?

184
00:12:23,929 --> 00:12:27,809
I saw it on your driver's license,
Newton Davis.

185
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:30,329
What kind of name
is that anyway?

186
00:12:30,409 --> 00:12:32,489
Only my father
calls me that.

187
00:12:32,569 --> 00:12:36,009
Yeah, my dad's name
is Bernard.

188
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:39,609
Bernard? That's kind of
a "Newtony" kind of name, isn't it?

189
00:12:39,649 --> 00:12:42,449
Bernard.
Oh, Dad.

190
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:46,089
I remember I used to curl up on his lap,
watch "Howdy Doody" with him,

191
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:48,689
roll down his socks
and tickle his feet.

192
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:50,650
Anyway,
this is my place.

193
00:12:50,689 --> 00:12:55,730
It's cozy. I like what you did
with the drape thing.

194
00:12:55,809 --> 00:12:58,249
- Yeah, well, I'm no architect.
- It's nice.

195
00:12:58,329 --> 00:13:01,929
I like the way you used
the negative space.

196
00:13:01,969 --> 00:13:04,089
- You're interesting.
- Really?

197
00:13:04,169 --> 00:13:09,369
Yeah, you're so...
average.

198
00:13:12,529 --> 00:13:14,889
Guess you better show me
where your phone is.

199
00:13:26,529 --> 00:13:30,249
Whoa!
I don't have a phone.

200
00:13:30,329 --> 00:13:32,849
What?

201
00:13:32,929 --> 00:13:35,889
Oh, I can't afford it.

202
00:13:35,969 --> 00:13:39,929
I figured I didn't know anybody in town,
so I just didn't get a phone.

203
00:13:40,009 --> 00:13:42,009
But I asked you if I
could use your phone.

204
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:45,129
- That's not what you asked me.
- That is exactly what I asked.

205
00:13:45,209 --> 00:13:48,889
You did not. You asked me if you
could come up here and sleep with me.

206
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:51,049
You know that
as well as I do.

207
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:10,089
You said yes.

208
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:40,769
May I stay?

209
00:14:42,689 --> 00:14:44,529
Yeah.

210
00:16:27,049 --> 00:16:29,409
Dobb's Mill.
Watch your step getting off.

211
00:16:29,449 --> 00:16:32,689
Thanks.
Bye.

212
00:16:56,649 --> 00:17:00,809
- Hi, Mary.
- Hi, Dave.

213
00:19:35,369 --> 00:19:39,329
Milk, juice...

214
00:19:39,369 --> 00:19:41,529
cereal and bread.

215
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:43,449
So, Hazel,

216
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:47,249
we're lookin' at $23.85.
Should I put that on your account?

217
00:19:47,329 --> 00:19:49,570
- Thank you, Travis.
- Okey-doke.

218
00:19:49,609 --> 00:19:52,569
- Hey, best to Stuey.
- All right.

219
00:19:52,569 --> 00:19:56,210
Potato, tomato,
avocado,

220
00:19:56,249 --> 00:20:00,129
pint of ice cream
and steak.

221
00:20:00,209 --> 00:20:03,729
So, miss, we're
lookin' at $34.63.

222
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:07,329
Right. Put that on the
Newton Davis account, please.

223
00:20:07,409 --> 00:20:10,849
- I beg your pardon?
- Newton Davis, 611 Hillside.

224
00:20:10,929 --> 00:20:13,770
I know Davis,
but he doesn't have an account here.

225
00:20:13,809 --> 00:20:16,409
- Wait, you're Travis, right?
- And you are?

226
00:20:16,489 --> 00:20:19,209
Yeah, he told me
about this store.

227
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:22,969
Great place! It reminds me
of when I was growing up.

228
00:20:23,049 --> 00:20:26,009
My grandfather had a store just like
this in a little town in Ohio.

229
00:20:26,089 --> 00:20:29,130
Uh-huh?
And your relation to Davis is?

230
00:20:29,209 --> 00:20:32,529
Oh, gosh,
where do I begin?

231
00:20:32,609 --> 00:20:34,890
It all happened
so fast.

232
00:20:34,969 --> 00:20:39,489
I mean, well, I came here really just
to get the house together and everything.

233
00:20:39,569 --> 00:20:42,089
He doesn't even know
that I'm here.

234
00:20:42,169 --> 00:20:45,170
I told him I went to see my sister
because she was pregnant in Toledo.

235
00:20:45,249 --> 00:20:48,050
I thought it would be
so great to surprise him,

236
00:20:48,129 --> 00:20:50,609
which I hope I do.

237
00:20:50,689 --> 00:20:53,729
I met him and then
he said to me...

238
00:20:53,769 --> 00:20:56,569
what a great little town
this was...

239
00:20:56,649 --> 00:20:59,889
and what a fabulous house he built
and the truth is, I'm his wife.

240
00:20:59,929 --> 00:21:04,849
You're telling me,
you and him are hitched?

241
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:09,009
Yeah. I hardly
believe it myself.

242
00:21:12,129 --> 00:21:16,489
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

243
00:21:16,569 --> 00:21:18,769
- Hi. I'm sorry.
- Hi.

244
00:21:18,849 --> 00:21:20,689
I couldn't help
but hear.

245
00:21:20,769 --> 00:21:23,609
- You're married to Newton Davis?
- Yeah.

246
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:25,329
- I'm Becky.
- Becky?

247
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:28,849
- Metcalf.
- Becky Metcalf?

248
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:31,769
Oh, Davis told me
all about you.

249
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:33,689
I'm Gwen.
Did he tell you about me?

250
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:37,609
- No, I didn't even know he was married.
- Oh, well!

251
00:21:37,649 --> 00:21:41,129
We really haven't told anybody yet.
It was kind of that crazy thing we did.

252
00:21:41,209 --> 00:21:43,369
We did it on the
spur of the moment.

253
00:21:43,449 --> 00:21:45,289
That's Davis.

254
00:21:45,369 --> 00:21:47,329
- Hi, Becky.
- Hi, Marge.

255
00:21:47,409 --> 00:21:50,729
- Tell me, how is he doing?
- Oh, he's great.

256
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:53,210
Well, you know.
He's such a fabulous guy.

257
00:21:53,289 --> 00:21:56,770
Nowadays, it's hard to tell if a guy's
gonna be there when you wake up.

258
00:21:56,849 --> 00:21:58,729
And you're living
in "the" house?

259
00:21:58,769 --> 00:22:03,009
Starting to. Just getting groceries,
housewares, pots and pans.

260
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:05,809
- The hardware store is over there.
- Oh.

261
00:22:05,889 --> 00:22:08,209
- Come on, I'll introduce you.
- Thanks.

262
00:22:08,249 --> 00:22:11,889
Aren't you nice?

263
00:22:19,369 --> 00:22:21,929
I don't have the cash
for all this.

264
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:24,210
Oh, don't be silly.
On your account.

265
00:22:24,249 --> 00:22:26,449
- Harv, grab a... Harv?
- Huh?

266
00:22:26,529 --> 00:22:29,489
Grab a percolator
off the shelf.

267
00:22:29,569 --> 00:22:33,569
Now, you bring Davis around so we can
congratulate him, that sly boots.

268
00:22:33,649 --> 00:22:37,209
- Well, I've gotta run.
- Okay.

269
00:22:37,249 --> 00:22:39,489
Maybe I'll call you
for dinner sometime?

270
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:41,129
Great!

271
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:44,049
Seems like the marriage
is off to a good start.

272
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:46,369
Yeah, so far
it's been ideal,

273
00:22:46,449 --> 00:22:49,849
kind of like I died
and went to heaven.

274
00:23:25,209 --> 00:23:28,329
Oh, hi!
Great chair!

275
00:23:28,409 --> 00:23:30,249
- You work here?
- Yes, ma'am.

276
00:23:30,329 --> 00:23:35,249
I love it. You could practically
live in this chair, you know?

277
00:23:35,329 --> 00:23:37,730
I don't see how.

278
00:23:37,809 --> 00:23:40,969
- How much?
- It's twenty dollars.

279
00:23:41,009 --> 00:23:42,129
How 'bout I give you
fifteen?

280
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:45,369
I'll tell you what.
I'll give you seventeen cash.

281
00:23:45,449 --> 00:23:47,289
We only take cash.

282
00:23:47,369 --> 00:23:49,609
- Do you deliver?
- Free of charge.

283
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:53,169
All right, you've got a deal.
611 Hillside.

284
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:55,609
Do you think you could
have it delivered by tonight?

285
00:23:55,689 --> 00:23:57,169
What was that address again?

286
00:23:57,169 --> 00:23:59,529
- 611 Hillside,
that house Newton Davis built.

287
00:23:59,609 --> 00:24:03,729
- That house is vacant.
- Well, we're moving back.

288
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:05,849
I'm Gwen.
I'm his wife.

289
00:24:05,929 --> 00:24:09,809
Mine's George.
I'm his father.

290
00:24:09,889 --> 00:24:14,049
All I can say, sir,
is that I apologize.

291
00:24:14,089 --> 00:24:17,249
Frankly, I was the one who,
after your son just...

292
00:24:17,329 --> 00:24:19,289
swept me off my feet,

293
00:24:19,369 --> 00:24:22,610
decided that maybe it would
be best if we waited...

294
00:24:22,689 --> 00:24:26,369
and see if the marriage was gonna work
before we told our families about it.

295
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:29,929
Of course, Newton said,
"Oh, you're just way too levelheaded.

296
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,369
You should be
more impulsive."

297
00:24:32,449 --> 00:24:34,329
Maybe he's right,
I don't know.

298
00:24:34,369 --> 00:24:36,730
But I just wanna say
that you guys raised...

299
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:40,289
the most caring,
sharing man.

300
00:24:40,369 --> 00:24:42,929
Thank you.

301
00:24:43,009 --> 00:24:46,529
Uh, Edna, any comments?

302
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,449
Why,
I don't believe it.

303
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:50,730
- You don't?
- I just don't believe it.

304
00:24:50,769 --> 00:24:54,129
- Which part?
- Tha... tha... that he could be so...

305
00:24:54,209 --> 00:24:56,809
insensitive,
so irresponsible!

306
00:24:56,889 --> 00:25:01,049
Because it's just like him, Edna.
The boy hasn't changed a bit.

307
00:25:01,129 --> 00:25:03,089
What does he think
marriage is?

308
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:05,009
And this question goes for
you, too, young woman.

309
00:25:05,049 --> 00:25:07,209
What do
young people today...

310
00:25:07,289 --> 00:25:09,529
think marriage...

311
00:25:09,609 --> 00:25:13,249
is?

312
00:25:13,289 --> 00:25:15,169
You don't mean like
write an essay?

313
00:25:15,209 --> 00:25:17,529
It's because of our
little dispute, isn't it?

314
00:25:17,529 --> 00:25:19,689
Is that why he kept this marriage a secret?

315
00:25:22,169 --> 00:25:25,729
Yes, it is.

316
00:25:25,809 --> 00:25:29,009
But he feels really badly
about all this, Mr. Davis.

317
00:25:29,089 --> 00:25:31,089
Why, you'd never know it
to talk to him.

318
00:25:31,169 --> 00:25:35,129
Perhaps because you
don't talk to him, George.

319
00:25:35,209 --> 00:25:37,329
- He's the one who never calls or visits.
- George!

320
00:25:37,409 --> 00:25:40,129
- You babied the boy, Edna.
- Mr. And Mrs. Davis,

321
00:25:40,169 --> 00:25:44,169
Newton is really sorry
about, um, you know.

322
00:25:44,249 --> 00:25:47,049
And, uh, he just
talks about it all the time.

323
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:50,009
In fact, he talked about it
the other night and he cried.

324
00:25:50,089 --> 00:25:54,169
- You hear that, George?
- I'm right here, Edna.

325
00:25:54,209 --> 00:25:57,649
My boy cried.

326
00:25:57,689 --> 00:26:00,249
Why don't you
pick up the phone...

327
00:26:00,329 --> 00:26:03,809
- and call the boy.
- I don't think that would be a good idea.

328
00:26:03,889 --> 00:26:06,929
For the time being, why don't you
send messages through me.

329
00:26:07,009 --> 00:26:11,009
George?

330
00:26:13,409 --> 00:26:16,369
Well, suppose you...

331
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:19,929
Oh, just tell him please,
for God's sake, come home.

332
00:26:20,009 --> 00:26:23,329
Oh, George.

333
00:26:39,369 --> 00:26:42,049
Um, come in.

334
00:26:42,129 --> 00:26:45,649
Come in!

335
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:48,009
Hello!

336
00:26:48,049 --> 00:26:52,129
- Edna!
- Hello.

337
00:26:52,209 --> 00:26:55,729
- Oh.
- Good morning. Is it morning?

338
00:26:55,809 --> 00:26:57,649
Oh my.

339
00:26:57,729 --> 00:27:02,009
- But if this isn't a convenient time...
- No, it's fine. Come in.

340
00:27:02,089 --> 00:27:04,889
- I didn't mean to come before you...
- That's all right. I'm awake.

341
00:27:04,929 --> 00:27:09,689
- Or dressed.
- Whoops.

342
00:27:09,769 --> 00:27:13,889
So I see you've already found
a spot to put your chair.

343
00:27:13,969 --> 00:27:17,289
Oh, yes.
Well, I'm just trying it out.

344
00:27:17,329 --> 00:27:19,649
Oh, what's that?

345
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:22,329
It's just a little something
to help you get started.

346
00:27:22,369 --> 00:27:24,689
Oh no,
I really couldn't.

347
00:27:24,769 --> 00:27:26,729
Wow!

348
00:27:26,809 --> 00:27:29,849
After all,
he is our only son.

349
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:35,769
Let's go spend it.

350
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:40,130
Hi, Davis.

351
00:27:40,209 --> 00:27:42,849
Hi.

352
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:49,649
Martin,

353
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:52,129
I've been thinking about the house
in Dobb's Mill, about selling it.

354
00:27:52,209 --> 00:27:54,849
- Sell it.
- I could pay back everyone I owe money to.

355
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:56,769
I agree. Could you
take a look at this?

356
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:59,569
Keeping this house is like
hanging onto the past.

357
00:27:59,609 --> 00:28:01,969
- The only entrance is through
the air conditioning duct.

358
00:28:01,969 --> 00:28:03,209
I was trying to solve that.

359
00:28:03,289 --> 00:28:06,089
I think it's preventing me from having
any real relationship with another woman.

360
00:28:06,169 --> 00:28:08,849
Right, with
Denise or Patricia.

361
00:28:08,889 --> 00:28:12,569
Or like
that waitress the other night.

362
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:15,650
- The one who didn't speak English?
- Very interesting woman.

363
00:28:15,689 --> 00:28:18,530
- You've got people exiting
into a wall! - Uh-oh.

364
00:28:18,609 --> 00:28:22,609
- Did you sleep with her?
- Oh, gee, you know...

365
00:28:22,689 --> 00:28:25,049
Yes, and I woke up in the
middle of the night...

366
00:28:25,129 --> 00:28:28,009
- completely tied up in knots.
- Okay!

367
00:28:28,089 --> 00:28:30,609
No, I mean
as in anxiety.

368
00:28:30,649 --> 00:28:33,729
And I did this horrible thing;
I left.

369
00:28:33,809 --> 00:28:37,249
I know what it is, it's Becky.
I gotta close the book on that.

370
00:28:37,329 --> 00:28:39,129
- I'm gonna sell the house.
- There you go.

371
00:28:39,209 --> 00:28:42,649
We just talk and talk.
There's so much to talk about.

372
00:28:42,689 --> 00:28:46,449
We have this amazing communication.
It's like Chinese food.

373
00:28:46,489 --> 00:28:47,369
Excuse me?

374
00:28:47,369 --> 00:28:50,929
- Like on Thursdays
and you can't deal with dinner?

375
00:28:51,009 --> 00:28:53,689
He comes home with this
big bag of Chinese take-out.

376
00:28:53,769 --> 00:28:55,609
It's just...
like he knew!

377
00:28:55,689 --> 00:28:59,689
- That's amazing.
- I know, Chinese food. Can you stand it?

378
00:28:59,769 --> 00:29:01,289
That's fabulous.

379
00:29:07,049 --> 00:29:10,169
Are you finished
with that?

380
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:13,649
Mmm. Ooh,
that's good.

381
00:29:13,729 --> 00:29:16,849
So, you were starting to tell me
how the two of you met.

382
00:29:16,929 --> 00:29:19,089
Oh, right.

383
00:29:19,169 --> 00:29:21,210
I'm crossing
Boylston street...

384
00:29:21,289 --> 00:29:25,649
and this moron doing a right on red
plows right into me and then takes off.

385
00:29:25,729 --> 00:29:27,849
- We never did catch him.
- Were you hurt?

386
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:30,849
My nose was busted,
both cheekbones were cracked,

387
00:29:30,929 --> 00:29:32,769
and the front of my jaw
was fractured.

388
00:29:32,809 --> 00:29:36,209
They had me all taped up
like one of those mummies...

389
00:29:36,249 --> 00:29:38,449
and all you could see were
my eyeballs and my lips.

390
00:29:38,529 --> 00:29:40,970
- My God!
- So I'm in this hospital room...

391
00:29:41,049 --> 00:29:44,409
and I'm sharing it with this woman
who works for an architectural firm.

392
00:29:44,489 --> 00:29:46,649
Davis came in and
brought her balloons.

393
00:29:46,689 --> 00:29:49,169
He felt sorry for me
on account of my being a mummy,

394
00:29:49,249 --> 00:29:52,210
and he gave me
one of the balloons.

395
00:29:52,289 --> 00:29:54,889
He came back the next day
to visit me,

396
00:29:54,969 --> 00:29:57,329
then the next and
then the next.

397
00:29:57,409 --> 00:30:01,169
It wasn't like a come-on
because he hadn't even seen my face.

398
00:30:01,249 --> 00:30:04,329
It was just two people talking,
during which came out that...

399
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:07,249
I didn't have the insurance
to pay for the bill so he paid for it.

400
00:30:07,329 --> 00:30:09,929
Davis did?

401
00:30:10,009 --> 00:30:13,610
- How long were you in?
- Two weeks.

402
00:30:13,689 --> 00:30:17,329
How could he afford that?
He's got all of his money in that house.

403
00:30:17,409 --> 00:30:19,849
Oh, well, you know
he's an architect.

404
00:30:19,929 --> 00:30:23,849
Yes, but he's just an associate.
It doesn't pay very much.

405
00:30:23,929 --> 00:30:27,689
- You know, he got promoted.
- He has?

406
00:30:27,769 --> 00:30:30,769
Mm-hmm, yeah.
They love him over at that firm now.

407
00:30:30,849 --> 00:30:32,089
They do?

408
00:30:32,169 --> 00:30:35,529
He's kicking big
architectural butt.

409
00:30:35,609 --> 00:30:39,289
He takes me home from the hospital
and runs all these errands for me...

410
00:30:39,329 --> 00:30:42,569
All this time,
he's never seen your face,

411
00:30:42,649 --> 00:30:44,529
you're still
all wrapped up?

412
00:30:44,569 --> 00:30:47,009
Oh, this is so Davis.

413
00:30:47,089 --> 00:30:50,529
Then one night,
he kissed me.

414
00:30:50,609 --> 00:30:54,129
And we started to...
well, you know.

415
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:56,209
Oooh.

416
00:30:56,289 --> 00:30:59,529
Here I am in this mummy mask,
but it was incredible...

417
00:30:59,609 --> 00:31:01,569
because I could be anyone.

418
00:31:01,649 --> 00:31:04,249
Oh, God,

419
00:31:04,289 --> 00:31:07,489
I can't tell you
how hot that made it.

420
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:16,129
So, then he wants to marry me
and he hasn't even seen my face.

421
00:31:16,209 --> 00:31:19,009
So what he proposes is,
which is of course what we did,

422
00:31:19,089 --> 00:31:22,249
is we got married the next week
at the hospital.

423
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:25,809
When the chaplain said "You may now kiss
the bride," instead of lifting the veil,

424
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:30,369
the doctor
unwrapped the gauze.

425
00:31:30,449 --> 00:31:34,969
And he saw me
for the first time.

426
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:39,809
And he looked at me...

427
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:41,810
and he smiled.

428
00:31:44,209 --> 00:31:47,409
And then,

429
00:31:47,449 --> 00:31:50,170
the rest.

430
00:31:50,249 --> 00:31:52,569
Oh.

431
00:31:52,649 --> 00:31:54,970
Yeah.

432
00:33:19,449 --> 00:33:21,250
Woo, Katie!

433
00:33:21,329 --> 00:33:24,449
¶ Katie, Katie bo-badie
Banana-fanna fo-fadie ¶

434
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:27,369
¶ Fee-fi-foo, matie
Katie ¶

435
00:33:27,409 --> 00:33:28,849
Yeah! Ollie!

436
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:33,089
- ¶ Ollie, Ollie bo-ballie
Banana-fanna... ¶ - Hello?

437
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:38,929
What are you
doing here?

438
00:33:38,929 --> 00:33:41,569
What am I doing?
What are you doing here?

439
00:33:46,449 --> 00:33:49,249
Well, I, I got kicked out of my
apartment and had no place to go.

440
00:33:49,329 --> 00:33:53,009
I would have called you except you never told
me where you lived or where your office was.

441
00:33:53,089 --> 00:33:55,569
You're the waitress,
Gwen.

442
00:33:55,649 --> 00:33:58,369
Well, excuse me but I thought
we'd been introduced.

443
00:33:58,449 --> 00:34:01,729
No, I recognize you. It's just,
you were wearing that Hungarian garb.

444
00:34:01,809 --> 00:34:03,809
I had to get out
of that place...

445
00:34:03,889 --> 00:34:05,769
because Karol and I had
a real difference of opinion...

446
00:34:05,809 --> 00:34:07,729
of exactly when he could come
into my apartment unannounced...

447
00:34:07,769 --> 00:34:10,689
and exactly where he could
put his hands while he was there.

448
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:13,049
- Didn't you have any friends
you could go to?

449
00:34:13,049 --> 00:34:14,689
I'd only been in Boston 3 weeks.

450
00:34:14,769 --> 00:34:18,089
All I had was that cute
drawing you did of this house.

451
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:22,209
I knew it was in Dobb's Mill and it was
just sitting here, not doing anything.

452
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:24,569
- Where did all of this furniture come from?
- Bigelows.

453
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:27,929
How did it get here?
Some furniture stampede?

454
00:34:27,969 --> 00:34:29,729
- I'll pay you back.
- Pay me back?

455
00:34:29,809 --> 00:34:32,209
Oh, Bobo, no.
Come on, honey.

456
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:34,929
The men are coming tomorrow
to put in the dog door.

457
00:34:35,009 --> 00:34:37,929
- What is happening?
- If you'd just listen.

458
00:34:38,009 --> 00:34:40,129
I'm listening.
I'm listening.

459
00:34:40,209 --> 00:34:43,329
All right.
I was hungry, okay?

460
00:34:43,369 --> 00:34:46,249
I went to Keller's Market
to pick up some peanut butter...

461
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:48,609
- and that's where I overheard
Hazel telling Travis...

462
00:34:48,609 --> 00:34:49,489
Whoa, whoa. Hazel?

463
00:34:49,569 --> 00:34:52,849
- Hazel Byron.
- You know Mrs. Byron?

464
00:34:52,889 --> 00:34:55,809
Yeah, your piano teacher?
Great gal.

465
00:34:55,890 --> 00:34:57,729
I don't know if you heard
about her son, Stuey,

466
00:34:57,810 --> 00:35:00,889
but oh, what he put
that poor woman through!

467
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:03,969
Go back to the store
where Mrs. Byron says to Mr. Keller...

468
00:35:04,009 --> 00:35:07,769
Okay. She told him
to just put it on her account.

469
00:35:07,849 --> 00:35:10,010
Charge the groceries
to me?

470
00:35:10,049 --> 00:35:13,009
Well, I was hungry.
You gotta understand that.

471
00:35:13,089 --> 00:35:14,969
How'd you get him
to do it?

472
00:35:15,049 --> 00:35:17,010
I guess he was under the impression
that I was...

473
00:35:17,089 --> 00:35:19,289
Insane?

474
00:35:19,369 --> 00:35:22,729
No, I just told him
to put it on our account.

475
00:35:22,809 --> 00:35:26,249
- Our account?
- Well, it seemed harmless.

476
00:35:28,969 --> 00:35:31,209
You told him
you were my wife?

477
00:35:31,289 --> 00:35:33,890
What was I supposed to do?
You tell me?

478
00:35:33,969 --> 00:35:36,929
And he believed you?

479
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:39,449
And why wouldn't he
believe me?

480
00:35:39,529 --> 00:35:42,649
- Well...
- I'm not good enough to be your wife?

481
00:35:42,729 --> 00:35:44,889
- No!
- Well, Travis thinks I'm good enough.

482
00:35:44,969 --> 00:35:47,689
- And Harvey and Lorraine
think I'm good enough.

483
00:35:47,689 --> 00:35:48,889
This coffee table.

484
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:52,329
- What about it?
- It's my mother's.

485
00:35:52,409 --> 00:35:54,889
I know, it's not
my taste either.

486
00:35:54,929 --> 00:35:57,049
But all of this
represents a compromise.

487
00:35:57,089 --> 00:35:59,929
- You know your mother.
- My parents think we're married?

488
00:35:59,969 --> 00:36:04,009
Hey, it's not so bad!
Everything's gonna be fine.

489
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:06,009
Would you mind
taking your feet off the furniture?

490
00:36:06,089 --> 00:36:07,969
Gwen.
Gwen?

491
00:36:08,049 --> 00:36:10,329
Gwen, Gwen, Gwen!

492
00:36:10,409 --> 00:36:13,089
- You can't stay here.
- Why not?

493
00:36:13,169 --> 00:36:15,809
- I hardly know you.
- Oh, come on!

494
00:36:15,889 --> 00:36:18,249
Where the hell
am I supposed to go?

495
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:20,969
- What do you mean you hardly know me?
- Gwen, I'm sorry.

496
00:36:21,009 --> 00:36:23,049
I'm terribly sorry
for the way I acted.

497
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:25,769
I'm going through a difficult time
and this isn't helping.

498
00:36:25,809 --> 00:36:30,489
Look, I've got maybe a hundred bucks here,
just 'til you get back on your feet again.

499
00:36:30,569 --> 00:36:33,169
- Take it.
- Is that payment for services rendered?

500
00:36:33,249 --> 00:36:36,290
- Oh, come on!
- I don't want your money!

501
00:36:36,369 --> 00:36:38,849
No, just my goddamn house, right?

502
00:36:42,129 --> 00:36:46,129
- Hello?
- Becky.

503
00:36:46,209 --> 00:36:49,730
I was dying to see how everything
looked, and I saw your car outside...

504
00:36:49,769 --> 00:36:51,449
And I, uh...

505
00:36:52,849 --> 00:36:55,849
Oh, congratulations.
I'm so happy for you.

506
00:36:55,929 --> 00:36:58,489
You needn't be.
You want to tell her or should I?

507
00:36:58,569 --> 00:37:01,689
You're a shit.

508
00:37:01,729 --> 00:37:05,529
- Maybe I'll just wait and come back.
- Becky! Becky!

509
00:37:05,569 --> 00:37:07,889
Becky, look,
here's what happened.

510
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:10,769
- Whatever it is, it's between you and Gwen.
- Becky...

511
00:37:10,809 --> 00:37:14,249
Let me say one thing.
That is a wonderful woman,

512
00:37:14,329 --> 00:37:17,249
and yours is a
genuinely unique marriage.

513
00:37:17,329 --> 00:37:18,649
I'll say.

514
00:37:18,689 --> 00:37:19,610
To marry a woman
whose face you've never seen...

515
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:24,449
until your wedding day at the hospital
when the doctor removes the gauze?

516
00:37:24,529 --> 00:37:27,009
That is unique,
my friend!

517
00:37:27,089 --> 00:37:30,730
It made my heart
go pitty-pat.

518
00:37:30,809 --> 00:37:32,809
Did it?

519
00:37:35,009 --> 00:37:37,209
Do you know why
I said no to you that day?

520
00:37:39,729 --> 00:37:41,570
It's because
you scared me,

521
00:37:41,649 --> 00:37:44,689
building this house,
putting a ribbon around it.

522
00:37:44,769 --> 00:37:46,689
I didn't want
to marry a dreamer.

523
00:37:46,729 --> 00:37:49,089
I'm not that brave.

524
00:37:49,169 --> 00:37:53,009
But when I see you
through Gwen's eyes,

525
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:55,609
- you look very different to me.
- How?

526
00:37:55,690 --> 00:38:00,689
Well, I could see how a dreamer,
with somebody who believes in him...

527
00:38:00,729 --> 00:38:03,370
could do great things.

528
00:38:03,449 --> 00:38:06,409
- I heard about your promotion.
- Hmm?

529
00:38:06,489 --> 00:38:10,090
Associate partner?
Wow!

530
00:38:10,129 --> 00:38:12,489
Oh, she told you
about that?

531
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:16,649
She's very proud of you.
She deserves to be.

532
00:38:16,729 --> 00:38:20,369
- I must admit, I'm a little jealous.
- Really?

533
00:38:20,449 --> 00:38:23,049
Yeah, a little.

534
00:38:25,889 --> 00:38:29,369
- Becky?
- Hmm?

535
00:38:30,969 --> 00:38:34,209
There's something
I think you should know.

536
00:38:34,249 --> 00:38:36,249
I slept with
Boomer Bauer?

537
00:38:36,329 --> 00:38:38,369
It's not like you
were being promiscuous.

538
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:41,849
He's your old boyfriend. You got
to reminiscing, and it just happened.

539
00:38:41,929 --> 00:38:43,769
Except now you don't know
where we stand.

540
00:38:43,849 --> 00:38:46,929
You gave me an old boyfriend
and you named him Boomer?

541
00:38:46,969 --> 00:38:50,369
I'm a little new at this.
But that's the beauty of it,

542
00:38:50,449 --> 00:38:54,049
that's why you left Boston to come up
here and decide between me and Boomer.

543
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:56,089
I can't believe
you told her that.

544
00:38:56,169 --> 00:38:59,610
I can't believe you can't believe it!
You've told a few whoppers yourself!

545
00:38:59,689 --> 00:39:03,969
- I told nice ones!
- Gwen.

546
00:39:04,049 --> 00:39:08,689
Gwen, I love her.

547
00:39:08,729 --> 00:39:11,529
I've always loved her,
but something went wrong.

548
00:39:11,609 --> 00:39:16,729
She couldn't picture me as her husband.
But now, with our being married,

549
00:39:16,809 --> 00:39:20,089
she finally sees me as
a husband-kind-of-guy.

550
00:39:20,169 --> 00:39:23,769
So, I think you and I
can help each other. Here's the deal.

551
00:39:23,809 --> 00:39:27,409
We're married but
our marriage is on the rocks.

552
00:39:27,489 --> 00:39:30,529
Every weekend, I drive up and
try hard to save this marriage.

553
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:33,569
- I get to stay in the house?
- Absolutely!

554
00:39:33,649 --> 00:39:36,729
Meanwhile, Becky's heart goes out to me,
you and I get divorced,

555
00:39:36,809 --> 00:39:39,569
and then, boom,
I get Becky.

556
00:39:41,729 --> 00:39:44,969
What do you say?

557
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:47,769
For a while there
it was really a great marriage.

558
00:39:49,689 --> 00:39:54,569
Well it was
until you came into it.

559
00:40:12,409 --> 00:40:14,889
Sweetheart,
oh sweetheart,

560
00:40:14,969 --> 00:40:17,089
you've made me
so happy.

561
00:40:17,169 --> 00:40:20,130
You've brought home
a princess.

562
00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:25,529
- Hi, Pop.
- Son.

563
00:40:25,569 --> 00:40:28,449
My little boy.

564
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:31,169
I see you've met Gwen.

565
00:40:37,209 --> 00:40:39,609
Why'd you do it,
son?

566
00:40:39,649 --> 00:40:42,249
- Well, I...
- Understand I like her. I like her a lot.

567
00:40:42,329 --> 00:40:44,849
But she is something
of an acquired taste.

568
00:40:44,929 --> 00:40:46,849
I've grown
quite fond of her.

569
00:40:46,929 --> 00:40:50,049
It's just the secrecy,
not sharing the decision.

570
00:40:50,129 --> 00:40:53,289
- I can't help but feel
it's part of our battle.

571
00:40:53,289 --> 00:40:54,010
Oh, Pop!

572
00:40:54,089 --> 00:40:56,610
Don't say a thing.
Gwen said it all for you.

573
00:40:56,649 --> 00:40:58,689
- She has?
- What I'm trying to say to you...

574
00:40:58,729 --> 00:41:00,529
is I apologize.

575
00:41:00,609 --> 00:41:03,689
You do?

576
00:41:05,689 --> 00:41:09,009
I won't deny
I was upset.

577
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:12,009
You go into debt to build a house
you won't live in...

578
00:41:12,049 --> 00:41:13,969
so you end up
with a mortgage...

579
00:41:14,049 --> 00:41:16,889
- and that crazy rent in the city.
- Don't start, Pop.

580
00:41:16,969 --> 00:41:18,809
I won't.
I won't.

581
00:41:18,889 --> 00:41:21,529
Finally you do make good decisions;
Gwen, for instance,

582
00:41:21,609 --> 00:41:25,329
plus now giving up the apartment
and coming back here.

583
00:41:25,369 --> 00:41:28,049
You told them I was
giving up my apartment?

584
00:41:28,129 --> 00:41:30,009
Uh, let me think.

585
00:41:30,049 --> 00:41:33,529
What she told us was
how sorry you felt.

586
00:41:33,609 --> 00:41:35,929
Like the other week
when you cried?

587
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:39,049
No shame in it, son. Just don't
do it often. Nobody likes a crybaby.

588
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:41,809
You told them
I was sorry?

589
00:41:41,889 --> 00:41:44,649
You did say you regretted
the situation, remember?

590
00:41:44,689 --> 00:41:49,369
Okay, but I never said
I was giving up my apartment.

591
00:41:49,449 --> 00:41:53,329
- Her intentions were good.
- Yes, her intentions.

592
00:41:53,409 --> 00:41:56,209
But that's a whole, separate subject,
isn't it, dear?

593
00:41:56,249 --> 00:42:01,569
- Up yours.
- Nicely put. What a princess, huh, Mom?

594
00:42:01,649 --> 00:42:06,369
Look, Mom, Dad, I didn't particularly
want to discuss this now,

595
00:42:06,449 --> 00:42:10,289
but you might as well know that, that,
that Gwen and I are separated.

596
00:42:10,329 --> 00:42:13,010
- What?
- That's the reason she came up here.

597
00:42:13,089 --> 00:42:14,609
What are you saying?

598
00:42:14,689 --> 00:42:17,609
I'm saying
the marriage is a bust.

599
00:42:17,649 --> 00:42:21,129
Go ahead, Pop, lecture me;
another immature move by Newton.

600
00:42:30,769 --> 00:42:34,609
Davis.
Davis?

601
00:42:38,609 --> 00:42:40,769
Look, I goofed, okay?

602
00:42:40,809 --> 00:42:44,329
I thought I was doing you a favor
bringing you and your dad back together.

603
00:42:44,409 --> 00:42:47,409
I don't see why we had
to get separated because of it.

604
00:42:47,489 --> 00:42:50,409
- We separated because of Boomer.
- We did not.

605
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:52,370
I came up to
sort things out.

606
00:42:52,449 --> 00:42:56,009
Geez, Boomer
was just a one-nighter.

607
00:43:10,849 --> 00:43:14,329
Come on, boy.
Come on, boy.

608
00:43:14,929 --> 00:43:17,649
Okay, okay.

609
00:43:17,729 --> 00:43:21,089
Stay outside, Bobo.
Okay, okay.

610
00:43:21,129 --> 00:43:25,809
Honey? Sweetheart?

611
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:28,609
Look who Bobo and I
bumped into jogging?

612
00:43:28,649 --> 00:43:31,129
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

613
00:43:31,169 --> 00:43:35,529
Oh, my goodness,
look at all the furnishings.

614
00:43:35,609 --> 00:43:40,209
I tried to use reflective light
to create a feeling of warmth.

615
00:43:44,169 --> 00:43:47,089
I think I'll
go make some tea.

616
00:43:49,449 --> 00:43:52,689
Oh, here's the tub
right next to the bed.

617
00:43:52,769 --> 00:43:56,489
- Notice it's designed for two.
- Oh?

618
00:43:56,529 --> 00:44:00,049
- I'm going!
- Yeah, bye.

619
00:44:02,609 --> 00:44:04,609
So, you like the house?

620
00:44:04,689 --> 00:44:07,049
Oh, well, uh,
how could I not?

621
00:44:07,130 --> 00:44:09,730
It's... In fact,
it makes me realize something...

622
00:44:09,809 --> 00:44:14,649
about Gwen sleeping
with that old boyfriend?

623
00:44:16,209 --> 00:44:19,929
I could see how something like that
might happen.

624
00:44:20,009 --> 00:44:22,249
You can?

625
00:44:22,329 --> 00:44:24,329
Can't you?

626
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:27,529
Oh, uh, yes.

627
00:44:27,609 --> 00:44:29,809
Which is to say that, I...

628
00:44:29,890 --> 00:44:33,409
You should really be more understanding
of her and, and forgiving.

629
00:44:33,489 --> 00:44:37,289
I mean,
she's just human.

630
00:44:37,329 --> 00:44:40,129
We're all just human.

631
00:44:40,209 --> 00:44:44,449
Lemon or sugar?

632
00:44:47,689 --> 00:44:49,009
- Bye.
- Bye.

633
00:44:49,089 --> 00:44:52,489
This was wonderful.
Thanks for the tour... oh, and the tea.

634
00:44:59,889 --> 00:45:02,209
Mom? Dad?

635
00:45:06,289 --> 00:45:07,969
Reverend Lipton?

636
00:45:08,009 --> 00:45:11,809
In the brief time I've gotten to know
Gwen, I must say I was shocked...

637
00:45:11,889 --> 00:45:16,929
when your parents came and told me
that you were both experiencing...

638
00:45:17,009 --> 00:45:18,689
difficulties.

639
00:45:18,769 --> 00:45:23,009
But so often,
just by talking it out,

640
00:45:23,049 --> 00:45:25,689
which we could arrange
say, on a weekly basis,

641
00:45:25,769 --> 00:45:26,929
perhaps at the church...

642
00:45:26,929 --> 00:45:29,249
- I am not going to counseling
with this woman,

643
00:45:29,329 --> 00:45:31,169
and that is final.

644
00:45:31,249 --> 00:45:33,810
- I'm disappointed in you.
- George, please.

645
00:45:33,889 --> 00:45:36,409
- You've gotten all you want,
now you want out.

646
00:45:36,409 --> 00:45:36,970
George.

647
00:45:37,049 --> 00:45:40,209
Marriage is different from a
one-night stand, or used to be.

648
00:45:40,289 --> 00:45:42,050
And it ought to be.

649
00:45:42,129 --> 00:45:44,409
What's everybody
coming down on me for?

650
00:45:44,489 --> 00:45:47,489
- She's the one.
- The one who what?

651
00:45:47,530 --> 00:45:49,849
The one who made up...

652
00:45:51,889 --> 00:45:56,329
- Made up what?
- Who made up...

653
00:45:56,409 --> 00:46:00,609
with her old boyfriend
and bedded down with him.

654
00:46:00,649 --> 00:46:05,370
She slept with her old boyfriend
after we were married.

655
00:46:14,249 --> 00:46:17,449
Maybe we should wait
out on the porch.

656
00:46:17,529 --> 00:46:20,329
- You babied him, Edna.
Now he can't hold his woman.

657
00:46:20,329 --> 00:46:21,569
Oh, shut up, George.

658
00:46:21,649 --> 00:46:25,530
- I was bored.
- What?

659
00:46:25,569 --> 00:46:27,649
Let her
get it out now.

660
00:46:27,729 --> 00:46:29,609
All I do is stay
around this house.

661
00:46:29,689 --> 00:46:33,009
- He never lets me do what I want.
- Try to be specific.

662
00:46:33,049 --> 00:46:35,729
Like those art classes
I wanted to take.

663
00:46:35,810 --> 00:46:37,769
And sometimes I really want
to go to the theater.

664
00:46:37,849 --> 00:46:40,289
Then he complains
about my thighs.

665
00:46:40,369 --> 00:46:42,810
So great, I'll go
to dancing class.

666
00:46:42,889 --> 00:46:44,889
He says, oh no,
it's too expensive.

667
00:46:44,969 --> 00:46:48,489
- I don't believe this.
- No, no, this is good.

668
00:46:48,529 --> 00:46:50,409
Purge, Gwen.
Purge.

669
00:46:50,449 --> 00:46:53,769
The courses I want to take
at the university.

670
00:46:53,849 --> 00:46:56,250
Do you think
he'll let me?

671
00:46:56,329 --> 00:46:58,889
What about the, the...
uh, tennis lessons.

672
00:46:58,929 --> 00:47:03,809
You quit after three weeks. The same
thing with the, the, uh, scuba diving.

673
00:47:03,889 --> 00:47:07,209
Because of those comments
you made about me and my rubber suit.

674
00:47:07,249 --> 00:47:09,889
I said you looked
like a porpoise.

675
00:47:09,970 --> 00:47:13,489
- Is that supposed to be cute?
- Flipper was a porpoise!

676
00:47:13,569 --> 00:47:15,529
I don't want to be
compared to Flipper.

677
00:47:15,609 --> 00:47:19,369
- I'm not comparing you to Flipper.
- Think how that makes me feel.

678
00:47:19,409 --> 00:47:23,049
- Shh. One at a time, please.
- Shut up!

679
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:25,249
- Wait a minute.
- Here's what the problem is.

680
00:47:25,330 --> 00:47:28,929
When I come home,
you're always organizing.

681
00:47:28,969 --> 00:47:30,810
For starters,

682
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:34,969
let's begin by both of you
trying once again...

683
00:47:35,009 --> 00:47:37,409
to live under
the same roof.

684
00:47:37,489 --> 00:47:39,649
Agreed?

685
00:47:39,730 --> 00:47:41,569
For you, Gwen,

686
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:44,289
let's start by trying
to work on this idea...

687
00:47:44,369 --> 00:47:48,209
of self-discipline, sticking
with something once you've begun it.

688
00:47:48,289 --> 00:47:50,489
For instance, this idea
of continuing your education.

689
00:47:50,570 --> 00:47:53,889
- Newton, I must say...
- I cannot afford it.

690
00:47:53,929 --> 00:47:58,930
Even with your big promotion
that the whole town is talking about?

691
00:48:05,329 --> 00:48:07,570
See you at choir practice.

692
00:48:11,329 --> 00:48:14,850
Don't they gather by the river? That's
where they're gonna find your body.

693
00:48:14,929 --> 00:48:17,009
Grow feathers and
shit in a tree!

694
00:48:17,089 --> 00:48:21,970
Why did you have to bring up sleeping
with what's-his-face? I was mortified.

695
00:48:22,009 --> 00:48:23,089
We made a deal.

696
00:48:23,089 --> 00:48:27,050
- That doesn't give you the right
to disparage my reputation.

697
00:48:27,089 --> 00:48:29,889
What are you talking about?
You're a con artist.

698
00:48:29,969 --> 00:48:32,810
Don't yell at me!
We're only pretending to be married.

699
00:48:32,889 --> 00:48:36,089
The only person pulling a con
is you with Becky.

700
00:48:36,169 --> 00:48:39,769
In return for which you extorted
free rent in a furnished house...

701
00:48:39,810 --> 00:48:42,129
and now
a college education!

702
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:45,089
- And dance classes.
- Lest we forget.

703
00:49:01,329 --> 00:49:04,049
- Are you nuts?
- I thought you'd love the idea.

704
00:49:04,129 --> 00:49:06,169
- Of marriage?
- It is not a marriage.

705
00:49:06,249 --> 00:49:08,929
It is an arrangement in which I will share
my house with her in exchange for which...

706
00:49:09,009 --> 00:49:12,369
she will argue with me and
make my life look pitiful.

707
00:49:12,409 --> 00:49:14,809
That's marriage.

708
00:49:14,889 --> 00:49:19,089
- How are you?
- Hey, how's the baby?

709
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:26,409
Guys!
Hi, guys!

710
00:49:27,889 --> 00:49:33,289
Well, I'll be home around 6:30.
Want me to pick up anything?

711
00:49:33,369 --> 00:49:36,209
Oh no, that sounds good.
No, no, I like that. Okay, great.

712
00:49:36,289 --> 00:49:39,089
Okay, bye, honey.
Gwen!

713
00:50:24,449 --> 00:50:26,729
- May I talk with you?
- Um...

714
00:50:26,809 --> 00:50:31,249
I just had a big fight with Gwen.
I came home from work and she started...

715
00:50:31,329 --> 00:50:34,049
I'm sorry, I shouldn't
even be talking about it.

716
00:50:34,129 --> 00:50:37,329
No, it's just... Uh, come in.
Come in, please.

717
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:39,849
I don't know how
I ended up here.

718
00:50:39,929 --> 00:50:42,889
I just walked away from the house
not thinking about where I was going.

719
00:50:42,969 --> 00:50:45,929
My thoughts were chaotic.
I saw the light in your window.

720
00:50:46,009 --> 00:50:50,609
- Davis, Gwen is here.
- She is?

721
00:50:50,689 --> 00:50:53,810
- You bet I am.
- What are you doing here?

722
00:50:53,889 --> 00:50:55,769
No, what are you
doing here?

723
00:50:55,809 --> 00:50:56,369
Oh God.

724
00:50:56,369 --> 00:50:59,449
- I am trying so hard to make
this marriage work.

725
00:50:59,529 --> 00:51:01,209
Oh, that is rich!

726
00:51:01,289 --> 00:51:04,809
- Rich?
- Guys, please.

727
00:51:04,889 --> 00:51:07,530
She promised she would
never see him again.

728
00:51:07,569 --> 00:51:09,450
Oh, it's my fault.

729
00:51:09,489 --> 00:51:13,290
Ask Mr. Matrimony when the
last time we slept together was.

730
00:51:13,369 --> 00:51:18,090
- What?
- You wanna tell her the truth?

731
00:51:18,169 --> 00:51:21,969
- Really?
- Once.

732
00:51:22,049 --> 00:51:25,529
Once in I don't want to tell you
how long. You want to tell her why?

733
00:51:25,609 --> 00:51:27,049
Me?

734
00:51:27,129 --> 00:51:32,289
Because our Mr. Davis
lives with a little, dark secret.

735
00:51:35,969 --> 00:51:38,689
Hey, really, I don't
want to get involved.

736
00:51:38,769 --> 00:51:43,330
Oh, but you are involved.
You're the secret.

737
00:51:43,409 --> 00:51:45,849
Oh, he's tried to
overcome it, God love him.

738
00:51:45,930 --> 00:51:50,369
He's tried to forget about you. For a time,
I thought we were really gonna make it.

739
00:51:50,449 --> 00:51:54,249
You felt so close to me then.
We used to wash each other's hair.

740
00:51:54,329 --> 00:51:56,889
Everything was
just so perfect.

741
00:51:56,969 --> 00:51:59,930
And then came Maui.

742
00:52:01,209 --> 00:52:03,449
What happened
in Maui?

743
00:52:06,569 --> 00:52:09,530
Uh, well...

744
00:52:09,609 --> 00:52:13,090
Gwen might as well
tell it.

745
00:52:14,129 --> 00:52:17,890
We went there to
celebrate his promotion.

746
00:52:17,969 --> 00:52:22,369
He was so happy then, almost too happy.
He was working so hard...

747
00:52:22,449 --> 00:52:24,890
to have fun
and please me.

748
00:52:24,969 --> 00:52:29,089
He'd chase me into the surf
and carry me into the cabana.

749
00:52:29,129 --> 00:52:30,930
He'd dance
and we'd drink.

750
00:52:30,969 --> 00:52:34,649
He'd toss nuts in the air
and catch them in his mouth,

751
00:52:34,689 --> 00:52:38,689
breaking his tooth so we had to spend
the last day of our vacation...

752
00:52:38,769 --> 00:52:42,089
Iooking for a dentist
to do an emergency crown.

753
00:52:42,170 --> 00:52:45,929
I'll never forget holding his hand
in that dentist's chair,

754
00:52:45,969 --> 00:52:48,969
waiting for him to wake up
from the gas they'd given him.

755
00:52:49,049 --> 00:52:52,849
He had that cotton
sticking out of his mouth.

756
00:52:52,929 --> 00:52:57,209
When he gazed up at me,
he said:

757
00:52:58,809 --> 00:53:00,649
"Becky.

758
00:53:02,890 --> 00:53:06,569
Oh, Becky."

759
00:53:11,449 --> 00:53:14,489
I came here tonight because
when you walked out that door...

760
00:53:14,529 --> 00:53:18,809
I had to see if this is
where you were gonna go.

761
00:53:21,929 --> 00:53:24,169
Gwen!

762
00:53:29,969 --> 00:53:32,449
- What are we gonna do?
- Oh, Davis.

763
00:53:34,929 --> 00:53:37,849
Hey, hey, hey!

764
00:53:37,929 --> 00:53:40,769
That was great. She's definitely
starting to come around.

765
00:53:40,849 --> 00:53:42,729
- Thank you.
- Just doing my job.

766
00:53:42,769 --> 00:53:45,810
- Did you come up with that
on the spur of the moment?

767
00:53:45,810 --> 00:53:46,249
Yeah.

768
00:53:46,329 --> 00:53:50,610
Wow! You're a genius. You're like
the Ernest Hemingway of bullshit.

769
00:53:50,689 --> 00:53:52,689
Really, you're like
a living work of art.

770
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:55,049
- Oh, God, I don't...
- What?

771
00:53:55,129 --> 00:53:57,689
Thank you.

772
00:54:02,129 --> 00:54:05,570
This is not something we want
to force on you by any means.

773
00:54:05,609 --> 00:54:09,649
We'd like you to consider
a little reception.

774
00:54:09,729 --> 00:54:12,129
- A what?
- People have been coming up to us...

775
00:54:12,209 --> 00:54:15,369
now that
the word is out,

776
00:54:15,450 --> 00:54:17,729
and asking
what they should do...

777
00:54:17,770 --> 00:54:19,649
in terms of gifts.

778
00:54:19,729 --> 00:54:23,049
- Gifts?
- No, no, no. No gifts.

779
00:54:23,089 --> 00:54:26,049
We're not talking
anything lavish.

780
00:54:26,129 --> 00:54:28,729
Would this be that I could,
like, go register?

781
00:54:28,809 --> 00:54:30,729
Certainly.
We could go together.

782
00:54:30,769 --> 00:54:32,730
- Sweetheart?
- Yes, honeybun?

783
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:35,529
Don't you think a reception
is a horrible idea?

784
00:54:35,569 --> 00:54:38,289
No.

785
00:54:38,369 --> 00:54:42,489
Our marriage is in
a very ambiguous state.

786
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:46,649
Which is why your mother and I agree
that it might be what the doctor ordered.

787
00:54:46,729 --> 00:54:50,010
- Give it a fresh start.
- I think you're right.

788
00:54:50,049 --> 00:54:53,489
Another thing, unless
this makes you uncomfortable,

789
00:54:53,570 --> 00:54:55,609
I'd like for you
to call me "Dad."

790
00:54:55,689 --> 00:54:59,289
Newton?

791
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:05,049
No, it wouldn't make me
feel uncomfortable at all...

792
00:55:05,129 --> 00:55:06,809
Dad.

793
00:55:12,249 --> 00:55:14,929
Shall we?

794
00:55:15,009 --> 00:55:18,089
Let me lay out
our thinking here.

795
00:55:18,169 --> 00:55:21,489
Uncles, aunts, cousins,
Gwen's parents...

796
00:55:21,569 --> 00:55:24,489
and any siblings or other relatives
who'd like to come.

797
00:55:24,570 --> 00:55:28,649
- We'd be delighted to have them.
- This is out of control.

798
00:55:28,729 --> 00:55:31,570
A marriage is bigger
than two people.

799
00:55:31,649 --> 00:55:33,969
We don't have
to invite her family.

800
00:55:34,049 --> 00:55:38,089
Newton, we'd like to meet them.
They're our family too.

801
00:55:38,169 --> 00:55:41,889
Well...

802
00:55:41,969 --> 00:55:44,009
Gwen's parents
are divorced.

803
00:55:44,089 --> 00:55:46,569
What's more,
they hate each other.

804
00:55:46,609 --> 00:55:50,969
If you get the two of them
in the same room, it's bedlam.

805
00:55:51,050 --> 00:55:54,330
Am I right?

806
00:55:54,409 --> 00:55:58,129
Oh, you poor thing.
I'm so sorry.

807
00:55:58,170 --> 00:56:01,809
I don't think a reception
would be wise.

808
00:56:01,890 --> 00:56:05,249
No!

809
00:56:05,329 --> 00:56:08,449
You're angry,
aren't you?

810
00:56:08,529 --> 00:56:12,009
- I am not angry.
- You're acting like you're angry.

811
00:56:12,049 --> 00:56:14,249
I'm fine, okay?
Can we drop it?

812
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:17,369
- What would you have done?
- Davis, I'm not arguing with you.

813
00:56:17,449 --> 00:56:21,490
They're divorced and they
hate each other's guts, fine!

814
00:56:21,569 --> 00:56:23,690
I've broken this line,

815
00:56:23,769 --> 00:56:27,569
cantilevered the rafters and
run the truss joist this way...

816
00:56:27,649 --> 00:56:29,929
and turned a negative
into a positive.

817
00:56:30,009 --> 00:56:33,409
It is so depressing to work
alongside someone of your caliber.

818
00:56:33,489 --> 00:56:36,489
- When did you come up with this?
- This morning or last night.

819
00:56:36,569 --> 00:56:37,769
You've been here all night?

820
00:56:37,769 --> 00:56:39,849
- Becky thinks
I've already got this promotion.

821
00:56:39,889 --> 00:56:42,449
- You told her that?
- Gwen did.

822
00:56:42,529 --> 00:56:44,729
So, can you
show this to Moseby?

823
00:56:44,810 --> 00:56:46,730
- You better do it.
- Why? He likes you!

824
00:56:46,769 --> 00:56:50,729
If I take that in there and Moseby starts
carrying on about how brilliant it is,

825
00:56:50,809 --> 00:56:52,889
I'm going to take
the credit.

826
00:56:52,969 --> 00:56:55,089
- What?
- Mm-hmm.

827
00:56:55,129 --> 00:56:57,489
You're my friend.
Where're your ethics?

828
00:56:57,570 --> 00:57:01,410
My ethics are that
I know this about myself...

829
00:57:01,489 --> 00:57:04,169
so I'm not going to take
this in and screw you over.

830
00:57:04,209 --> 00:57:06,409
Mr. Sharpstein!

831
00:57:12,729 --> 00:57:16,009
Do you think Mr. Moseby
might see me?

832
00:57:16,089 --> 00:57:18,849
Let me check.

833
00:57:22,569 --> 00:57:27,129
Mr. Davis from the third
floor to see you.

834
00:57:27,209 --> 00:57:31,369
Okay.
Go right on in.

835
00:57:31,449 --> 00:57:33,890
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

836
00:57:35,209 --> 00:57:37,169
Thank you.

837
00:57:39,129 --> 00:57:42,969
- Davis! You're in a lot of trouble.
- Mr. Moseby.

838
00:57:43,049 --> 00:57:43,609
I am?

839
00:57:43,609 --> 00:57:47,409
- How the hell come
I never knew you were married?

840
00:57:47,489 --> 00:57:49,889
Hi, honey.

841
00:57:49,969 --> 00:57:52,849
If this little gal
hadn't wandered to the wrong floor...

842
00:57:52,889 --> 00:57:56,810
Davis, when one of our young people gets
married, I want to be the first to know,

843
00:57:56,889 --> 00:58:00,090
especially when his wife
and I have so much in common.

844
00:58:00,169 --> 00:58:04,809
We just figured out Gwen's dad and I
fought in the same outfit in the Pacific.

845
00:58:04,890 --> 00:58:07,969
- Really?
- Isn't that incredible?

846
00:58:08,009 --> 00:58:12,089
Not half as incredible as the
story of meeting the Dunckles.

847
00:58:12,170 --> 00:58:14,809
- The who?
- Her parents.

848
00:58:14,889 --> 00:58:20,289
- Oh! Yeah, gosh, was that ever funny.
- You thought it was funny?

849
00:58:20,369 --> 00:58:23,130
It was funny at first.
There was that incident.

850
00:58:23,169 --> 00:58:26,010
Which made me so angry.

851
00:58:26,049 --> 00:58:29,649
- Yes, but I can explain.
- Shake my hand.

852
00:58:29,689 --> 00:58:31,770
You brought that man
back to life.

853
00:58:31,849 --> 00:58:35,169
You're an extraordinary
human being.

854
00:58:35,249 --> 00:58:38,889
Well, he's just such a great guy,
Gwen's dad.

855
00:58:38,969 --> 00:58:42,009
What's Gwen's dad
got to do with it?

856
00:58:42,089 --> 00:58:44,130
I'm talking
about your dad...

857
00:58:44,209 --> 00:58:47,849
when you sang,
"Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral" to him,

858
00:58:47,889 --> 00:58:51,569
bringing tears
to his eyes.

859
00:58:51,649 --> 00:58:54,929
Damn, Davis, there's more
to you than meets the eye.

860
00:58:54,969 --> 00:58:57,970
And you always seemed
a strange duck.

861
00:58:58,049 --> 00:59:01,729
- That's because he's a swan, Mr. Moseby.
- Listen to her.

862
00:59:01,810 --> 00:59:05,009
Honey, how come you never invited
Mr. Moseby over to the house?

863
00:59:05,049 --> 00:59:07,409
My hubby designed the most
beautiful little house.

864
00:59:07,489 --> 00:59:08,849
He did now?

865
00:59:08,849 --> 00:59:12,529
I've got the perfect idea.
The reception.

866
00:59:12,569 --> 00:59:15,089
Saturday afternoon,
nothing fancy,

867
00:59:15,169 --> 00:59:17,089
just family
and friends over.

868
00:59:17,170 --> 00:59:20,449
Oh, I don't want
to impose.

869
00:59:20,529 --> 00:59:23,490
No imposition at all,
Winston.

870
00:59:23,569 --> 00:59:26,370
And wait until you see
this house he designed!

871
00:59:26,449 --> 00:59:28,889
It's particularly great
for entertaining.

872
00:59:28,970 --> 00:59:32,130
But you're going to be
with your relatives!

873
00:59:33,889 --> 00:59:36,930
Yeah, like, like, like
Gwen's dad.

874
00:59:36,969 --> 00:59:39,649
They're driving in from Toledo
and I'd love to show you the house.

875
00:59:39,729 --> 00:59:42,849
You and Gwen's dad
can catch up on old times.

876
00:59:42,929 --> 00:59:45,489
Well, sounds good.

877
00:59:50,729 --> 00:59:55,170
This is so fantastic! I can't believe
you came to help me get this promotion.

878
00:59:55,209 --> 00:59:57,489
This is above and beyond.
Gwen, you're amazing.

879
00:59:57,529 --> 01:00:00,649
- Did you notice how I picked up your cue?
- Yeah.

880
01:00:00,729 --> 01:00:04,049
This is so interesting,
like, your last name is Dunckle.

881
01:00:04,090 --> 01:00:08,489
- I never knew your last name.
- It's Buckley.

882
01:00:08,569 --> 01:00:11,169
- Well, technically my husband's name.
- You're married?

883
01:00:11,209 --> 01:00:14,449
- Was.
- So Dunckle is your maiden name?

884
01:00:14,489 --> 01:00:16,889
Sort of.
It was my mom's name.

885
01:00:16,969 --> 01:00:19,569
Maybe my dad's,
he was never in the picture.

886
01:00:19,649 --> 01:00:23,369
Who do you consider your parents?
Let me put it this way.

887
01:00:23,409 --> 01:00:26,609
Who's the guy in Toledo who watched "Howdy
Doody" and served in the South Pacific?

888
01:00:26,689 --> 01:00:28,529
An invention!

889
01:00:32,409 --> 01:00:35,090
The problem is
you stink at lying.

890
01:00:35,129 --> 01:00:37,290
- Every time you try,
you get us into trouble.

891
01:00:37,290 --> 01:00:38,689
Forgive me, o queen of crap.

892
01:00:38,769 --> 01:00:41,289
- The problem is,
you don't have any parents.

893
01:00:41,289 --> 01:00:42,809
No, I don't have parents.

894
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:46,569
- Did they pass away?
- I don't know.

895
01:00:46,649 --> 01:00:49,569
Don't worry,
I'll get some.

896
01:00:57,129 --> 01:01:00,289
We are so pleased
about the reception.

897
01:01:00,369 --> 01:01:03,929
Your folks are coming to town.
You two are getting along.

898
01:01:04,009 --> 01:01:07,209
- We like to think we had a hand in that.
- Oh look!

899
01:01:07,289 --> 01:01:09,689
- It looks like something
Granny would have.

900
01:01:09,689 --> 01:01:10,969
That's a nice pattern.

901
01:01:11,049 --> 01:01:13,129
- Nice?
- What about this?

902
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:16,209
That I like!
That's us.

903
01:01:17,849 --> 01:01:20,569
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

904
01:01:25,169 --> 01:01:28,409
I suggested
we have the reception.

905
01:01:28,450 --> 01:01:31,289
A marriage is bigger
than two people.

906
01:01:31,330 --> 01:01:34,569
I just want to do everything
I can to save it.

907
01:01:34,649 --> 01:01:38,409
You're such a great husband, Davis.

908
01:01:38,450 --> 01:01:41,249
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

909
01:01:41,330 --> 01:01:45,529
When you married Gwen,
was it, in some small way,

910
01:01:45,569 --> 01:01:47,489
to get back at me?

911
01:01:47,529 --> 01:01:50,649
To show me what a wonderful
husband you would've been?

912
01:01:50,729 --> 01:01:53,929
It probably had
something to do with it.

913
01:01:54,009 --> 01:01:57,889
- People do such foolish things!
- Oh!

914
01:01:57,969 --> 01:02:01,249
Becky, I feel like
I have so much to tell you.

915
01:02:01,289 --> 01:02:04,209
When I first met Gwen,
I was still on the rebound.

916
01:02:04,289 --> 01:02:08,449
Oh! Thanks
for letting me talk.

917
01:02:08,529 --> 01:02:11,289
- A lot of this is my fault.
- No!

918
01:02:11,370 --> 01:02:14,769
If I hadn't turned you down,
misjudged you.

919
01:02:14,849 --> 01:02:19,089
I'm so lonely, Davis.
The men I date, it never works out.

920
01:02:19,169 --> 01:02:22,649
Most of them are just jerks.
They make up stories.

921
01:02:22,729 --> 01:02:25,689
They'll tell you anything
to get you into bed.

922
01:02:25,770 --> 01:02:28,209
Then there are
the guys like you,

923
01:02:28,289 --> 01:02:32,529
the kind you don't appreciate
when you have the chance.

924
01:02:34,449 --> 01:02:37,289
Thanks for
letting me talk.

925
01:03:21,449 --> 01:03:23,849
Oh, Davis.

926
01:04:12,409 --> 01:04:16,289
Oh, Becky,
I've wanted you for so long.

927
01:04:19,890 --> 01:04:22,329
Oh, Davis.

928
01:04:23,409 --> 01:04:27,529
Ah yes.
Oh, Davis.

929
01:04:27,609 --> 01:04:31,410
Oh yes.

930
01:04:31,489 --> 01:04:34,369
No! Wait!
Not like this.

931
01:04:34,449 --> 01:04:37,889
- Why?
- I can't! I can't be the other woman.

932
01:04:37,969 --> 01:04:41,329
If your marriage ends, it ends,
but not because of me.

933
01:04:41,369 --> 01:04:45,209
Can't you understand?
You're married!

934
01:05:17,290 --> 01:05:19,689
Come on, come on!

935
01:05:33,890 --> 01:05:37,170
How was your day?

936
01:05:37,249 --> 01:05:39,729
Oh, it was okay.

937
01:05:39,809 --> 01:05:42,409
I was just too tired to make
anything other than that.

938
01:05:42,449 --> 01:05:47,129
I brought some Chinese. I figured you'd
be exhausted from shopping with my mother.

939
01:05:47,209 --> 01:05:51,009
I get exhausted thinking about it.
Did you get a dress?

940
01:05:51,089 --> 01:05:53,129
- You brought me Chinese food?
- Yeah.

941
01:05:53,209 --> 01:05:55,369
Did you get a dress for the reception?
It's in two days.

942
01:05:55,409 --> 01:05:56,969
Oh yeah.

943
01:06:01,929 --> 01:06:06,569
Would you mind not going around
the house dressed like that?

944
01:06:06,569 --> 01:06:09,809
- Like this?
- Yes, like that. And not just that.

945
01:06:09,889 --> 01:06:14,849
A lot of what you wear,
you look very... pert.

946
01:06:14,929 --> 01:06:19,129
I have to live here too and
I wouldn't want to, you know.

947
01:06:19,209 --> 01:06:20,449
What?

948
01:06:20,489 --> 01:06:23,769
To f... f...
to confuse the situation!

949
01:06:23,849 --> 01:06:26,809
Like nothing too revealing
or too tight?

950
01:06:26,889 --> 01:06:29,409
Tight and revealing,
that's fine.

951
01:06:29,489 --> 01:06:31,689
It's like this kind
of thing.

952
01:06:31,770 --> 01:06:34,569
Whether you know it or not,
it's a turn-on.

953
01:06:34,609 --> 01:06:36,609
Or like this
for God's sake.

954
01:06:36,689 --> 01:06:38,169
That's a turn-on?

955
01:06:38,249 --> 01:06:41,209
Are you kidding? You look incredible
in this. Just don't wear it.

956
01:06:41,249 --> 01:06:43,449
How 'bout
this old thing?

957
01:06:43,529 --> 01:06:45,929
No!
Especially not that.

958
01:06:48,049 --> 01:06:52,009
Out of fairness, is there anything
I wear that you prefer I didn't?

959
01:06:53,489 --> 01:06:55,369
No.

960
01:07:02,009 --> 01:07:05,049
- Moseby sure is pumped
about meeting Gwen's dad.

961
01:07:05,049 --> 01:07:05,650
I know.

962
01:07:05,729 --> 01:07:08,769
If I get through this reception,
everything's gonna fall into place.

963
01:07:08,849 --> 01:07:09,209
The promotion, Becky,
the whole ball of string.

964
01:07:09,249 --> 01:07:10,069
- You think you're gonna
pull this thing off?

965
01:07:10,069 --> 01:07:11,129
Me? Her. Gwen!

966
01:07:12,209 --> 01:07:13,929
She'll pull this off.
She's some kind of a genius.

967
01:07:13,929 --> 01:07:15,529
But I want to do something for her
after Becky and I are married.

968
01:07:15,609 --> 01:07:17,309
Hell, she's been
kicked around so much.

969
01:07:17,309 --> 01:07:18,869
- Gentlemen, welcome to the Budapest.
- I don't want to eat here.

970
01:07:18,869 --> 01:07:20,949
- Why? What's wrong?
- Gwen.

971
01:07:21,029 --> 01:07:23,789
Gwen? Oh, beautiful Gwen!
Where is she?

972
01:07:23,869 --> 01:07:28,589
You can tell Gwen that she can come back
anytime. She's always fun for me.

973
01:07:28,629 --> 01:07:32,149
You son-of-a-bitch! Taking advantage
of a sweet girl like that.

974
01:07:32,229 --> 01:07:34,310
I'll see you
back at the office.

975
01:07:34,389 --> 01:07:36,429
Jesus Christ!
Somebody call the cops.

976
01:07:36,469 --> 01:07:39,069
- Call the cops for him.
- What are you talking about?

977
01:07:39,149 --> 01:07:42,069
I'm talking about what
your boss did to Gwen Dunckle.

978
01:07:42,109 --> 01:07:43,189
Huh?

979
01:07:43,269 --> 01:07:45,109
Or Buckley, rather.

980
01:07:45,189 --> 01:07:47,869
Gwen?
You mean Gwen Phillips?

981
01:07:47,949 --> 01:07:50,149
Phillips?
Okay, yeah.

982
01:07:50,189 --> 01:07:52,909
- He knows where is Gwen?
- Funny you should ask.

983
01:07:52,989 --> 01:07:55,310
You're the one who raised the rent.
"Put out or get out."

984
01:07:55,389 --> 01:07:59,309
- Karol did? That's hard to believe.
- Why?

985
01:07:59,389 --> 01:08:03,549
Karol doesn't own the apartment
and she would have told me.

986
01:08:03,629 --> 01:08:05,789
I've known Gwen
since Toledo.

987
01:08:05,829 --> 01:08:09,109
What's that babe
up to?

988
01:08:10,390 --> 01:08:13,149
You know Gwen?

989
01:08:27,589 --> 01:08:29,749
Hi.

990
01:08:31,110 --> 01:08:35,069
- Look what Aunt Millie
and Uncle Hughie sent.

991
01:08:35,069 --> 01:08:35,709
Nice.

992
01:08:38,269 --> 01:08:40,029
Bumped into Patty today.

993
01:08:40,109 --> 01:08:44,149
- Who?
- Waitress at the Budapest?

994
01:08:44,229 --> 01:08:47,949
You might not remember her though she was
a good friend. She helped you get your job.

995
01:08:48,029 --> 01:08:52,829
You lived in the same foster home
in Toledo for almost four years.

996
01:08:56,109 --> 01:09:00,749
She was offended that you didn't call
her after your boss busted in on you.

997
01:09:00,789 --> 01:09:05,469
Imagine his surprise when I dropped in at
the restaurant and punched him in the face!

998
01:09:05,549 --> 01:09:07,949
- You did that?
- Oh, yes.

999
01:09:07,989 --> 01:09:10,269
You punched Karol in the face
just for me?

1000
01:09:10,349 --> 01:09:13,029
I punched a totally
innocent Hungarian!

1001
01:09:13,109 --> 01:09:17,149
I know, but still no one's ever done
anything like that for me before.

1002
01:09:17,229 --> 01:09:20,509
You lied to me.

1003
01:09:20,549 --> 01:09:24,069
Nothing new, I realize.
But just for the record,

1004
01:09:24,149 --> 01:09:26,429
you lied about having
no place to go, didn't you?

1005
01:09:26,510 --> 01:09:30,789
This whole thing has been one big
put-on. Everything with you is a fake.

1006
01:09:30,869 --> 01:09:35,430
I know about you. I know about Ernie
Phillips, your knight in shining armor.

1007
01:09:35,469 --> 01:09:38,109
I know about finding yourself
married in Akron at sixteen.

1008
01:09:38,189 --> 01:09:40,029
What difference
does it make?

1009
01:09:40,109 --> 01:09:42,669
What difference
does it make?

1010
01:09:42,749 --> 01:09:47,510
It's the difference between fact
and fiction, for crying out loud!

1011
01:09:47,549 --> 01:09:51,549
Between real and unreal,
between human interaction and bullshit.

1012
01:09:51,589 --> 01:09:55,669
Just for once, Gwen,
just for laughs, tell me the truth.

1013
01:09:55,749 --> 01:10:00,189
Tell me why, for God's sake,
did you come here?

1014
01:10:06,829 --> 01:10:11,989
I, I just wanted to see what it
would be like to live in that picture.

1015
01:10:13,789 --> 01:10:18,510
Not just the house,
but...

1016
01:10:18,549 --> 01:10:22,189
the town and...

1017
01:10:22,269 --> 01:10:25,589
the people,
the life.

1018
01:10:25,669 --> 01:10:30,069
I never had anything
like that before.

1019
01:10:30,149 --> 01:10:32,989
I really didn't intend
for it to get this elaborate.

1020
01:10:33,069 --> 01:10:37,229
It's just that everyone around here
keeps treating me like I'm somebody.

1021
01:10:39,109 --> 01:10:42,469
Except you.

1022
01:10:55,829 --> 01:10:58,949
What are you doing?

1023
01:10:59,029 --> 01:11:00,709
Catching a bus.

1024
01:11:00,789 --> 01:11:03,029
This is not something
you can just walk out on,

1025
01:11:03,109 --> 01:11:06,389
not after all
we've been through.

1026
01:11:06,429 --> 01:11:10,029
How am I supposed to get the promotion
you gave me that Becky thinks I've got,

1027
01:11:10,070 --> 01:11:13,029
if Moseby comes tomorrow
and finds you gone?

1028
01:11:13,109 --> 01:11:15,789
Do yourself a favor, Davis.
Let it go.

1029
01:11:15,869 --> 01:11:17,709
Hey, we made a deal.

1030
01:11:17,789 --> 01:11:21,789
The deal also included
that we got divorced, remember?

1031
01:11:26,589 --> 01:11:29,989
- I'll pay you alimony.
- What?

1032
01:11:30,069 --> 01:11:33,069
You just stay and help me
through the reception tomorrow.

1033
01:11:33,149 --> 01:11:35,909
- I'll, I'll give you
a hundred bucks a month.

1034
01:11:35,909 --> 01:11:36,589
For life?

1035
01:11:36,669 --> 01:11:41,070
Yeah, or until you remarry,
that's the custom, isn't it?

1036
01:11:41,149 --> 01:11:42,990
You're too much.

1037
01:11:43,069 --> 01:11:46,389
So, what do you say?

1038
01:11:56,869 --> 01:11:59,669
All right,
I'll stay.

1039
01:11:59,709 --> 01:12:02,190
Just keep your wallet
in your pocket, Davis.

1040
01:12:02,269 --> 01:12:05,630
- I want you to have something.
- I don't want your money.

1041
01:12:07,869 --> 01:12:10,589
I will take
the furniture, though.

1042
01:12:18,949 --> 01:12:22,350
Okay, George,
the turkey's got two more hours.

1043
01:12:22,429 --> 01:12:24,270
The jell-o mold's
in the fridge.

1044
01:12:24,349 --> 01:12:26,750
I'm gonna get
to these cookies.

1045
01:12:26,789 --> 01:12:29,749
- Sweetheart, did you borrow a punch bowl?
- Yeah.

1046
01:12:29,789 --> 01:12:32,309
- From Aunt Millie.
- Aunt Louise.

1047
01:12:32,389 --> 01:12:35,709
- Not Aunt Millie?
- Don't start, Pop.

1048
01:12:35,789 --> 01:12:39,469
- Gwen's folks in yet?
- Yes, she's picking them up now.

1049
01:12:39,549 --> 01:12:43,269
Ralph? Mary?

1050
01:12:44,629 --> 01:12:47,469
- Hello.
- Hey, where you been?

1051
01:12:47,509 --> 01:12:50,429
Oh, have I got a job
for you.

1052
01:13:13,669 --> 01:13:17,749
I'm gonna go in and see
if Gwen's folks have arrived.

1053
01:13:22,069 --> 01:13:23,869
- You must be the lucky man.
- Well...

1054
01:13:23,950 --> 01:13:25,469
We're Gwen's folks.
I'm Ralph.

1055
01:13:25,549 --> 01:13:30,029
Excuse me.
Bernie Dunckle, U.S.S. Pennsylvania,

1056
01:13:30,110 --> 01:13:33,069
Assistant Gunner's Mate.
That's Mary.

1057
01:13:33,109 --> 01:13:36,069
- Hello.
- Hello.

1058
01:13:36,150 --> 01:13:39,590
- They look good. Where'd you get 'em?
- I knew them at the Budapest.

1059
01:13:39,669 --> 01:13:44,669
- Uh-oh, here we... Let me
get that, Mom. - Oh, thank you.

1060
01:13:44,749 --> 01:13:46,990
All right, big moment now.

1061
01:13:47,029 --> 01:13:51,349
George and Edna Davis,
Bernie and Mary Dunckle.

1062
01:13:53,749 --> 01:13:55,589
- Here you go.
- I'll take that.

1063
01:13:55,669 --> 01:13:57,389
Put her there, pal.

1064
01:13:57,429 --> 01:14:00,989
- Hello.
- Oh, yes, hello.

1065
01:14:01,069 --> 01:14:03,349
I can't tell you how delighted
we are that our peach...

1066
01:14:03,389 --> 01:14:06,549
did so goddamn well
for herself.

1067
01:14:06,629 --> 01:14:08,469
A firm grip. I like that.

1068
01:14:08,549 --> 01:14:12,589
- You know this is a damn nice adobe.
- Thank you, Bernie.

1069
01:14:12,669 --> 01:14:15,949
Okay, let's start off
with one of Gwen with her folks.

1070
01:14:16,029 --> 01:14:19,029
- I'm not dressed yet.
- You look fine.

1071
01:14:19,109 --> 01:14:21,109
Mom, the guests are
starting to arrive.

1072
01:14:21,189 --> 01:14:24,909
Leave your mother be.
She's excited. All right.

1073
01:14:24,949 --> 01:14:27,109
Let's have one
with just the moms.

1074
01:14:27,149 --> 01:14:30,750
You take this.
Bernie and I will go and break the ice.

1075
01:14:30,789 --> 01:14:33,869
- Break it? Let's melt it.
- George!

1076
01:14:33,949 --> 01:14:37,509
- Ray!
- Oh, Ray!

1077
01:14:37,589 --> 01:14:38,749
I brought
the whole clan with me.

1078
01:14:38,830 --> 01:14:43,029
- Bernie Dunckle, U.S.S. Pennsylvania.
- Bernie!

1079
01:14:43,109 --> 01:14:44,949
Come on over.

1080
01:14:47,750 --> 01:14:50,630
- No, Bobo. Come on, outside.
- What a greeting!

1081
01:14:53,429 --> 01:14:57,749
Gwen! Mary!
Where did they get off to?

1082
01:14:57,789 --> 01:15:00,989
Here you go.

1083
01:15:11,629 --> 01:15:13,549
Hello.

1084
01:15:13,629 --> 01:15:17,669
Oh... my... God.

1085
01:15:20,789 --> 01:15:23,550
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

1086
01:15:23,629 --> 01:15:26,509
- Where's Gwen?
- I was just going to ask you that.

1087
01:15:26,589 --> 01:15:28,149
Hi!

1088
01:15:31,230 --> 01:15:34,149
Sweetheart, the guests are arriving.
You're needed pronto.

1089
01:15:34,229 --> 01:15:36,069
Is that the best you could do for parents?

1090
01:15:36,069 --> 01:15:38,029
You got them off the street,
for God's sake!

1091
01:15:38,109 --> 01:15:41,790
Gwen? Gwen!
Oh God!

1092
01:15:43,589 --> 01:15:45,429
I see you.

1093
01:15:45,509 --> 01:15:49,070
Would you please get the hell away
from the keyhole?

1094
01:15:49,149 --> 01:15:52,469
- What is it? What's going on?
- Just go away.

1095
01:15:52,549 --> 01:15:56,589
Moseby's going to be here and your
parents can't carry it off without you.

1096
01:15:56,589 --> 01:15:57,389
Please, Gwen.

1097
01:15:57,469 --> 01:16:00,349
- Here is the bedroom...
- Gwen!

1098
01:16:00,389 --> 01:16:03,269
- Something wrong, son?
- Uh, no.

1099
01:16:03,309 --> 01:16:06,829
- Is Gwen in there?
- She won't come out.

1100
01:16:06,909 --> 01:16:09,869
She's nervous or something.

1101
01:16:12,869 --> 01:16:15,390
Oh boy, Moseby's here.
Oh God, all right.

1102
01:16:15,469 --> 01:16:17,590
Moseby?
U.S.S. Pennsylvania!

1103
01:16:17,669 --> 01:16:20,669
Stay! Stay!

1104
01:16:20,750 --> 01:16:22,950
Stay!
Hi, how are you?

1105
01:16:22,989 --> 01:16:26,029
- Davis, you look great!
- Maybe you should talk to her.

1106
01:16:34,269 --> 01:16:36,149
Hello?

1107
01:16:36,229 --> 01:16:38,389
It's Mommy, angel.

1108
01:16:38,469 --> 01:16:41,829
We're all
waiting for you.

1109
01:16:45,749 --> 01:16:47,749
- Nice house, Newton!
- Great, thank you.

1110
01:16:47,829 --> 01:16:50,389
- Where's Gwen?
- Oh, sorry.

1111
01:16:50,469 --> 01:16:53,950
- Oh, Becky. Hi.
- Hi.

1112
01:16:54,029 --> 01:16:57,669
- Uh, where's Gwen?
- She's in her room and she won't come out.

1113
01:16:57,749 --> 01:17:00,549
- She wanted this reception.
- This is what it's like with her.

1114
01:17:00,629 --> 01:17:02,949
I try, and I try,
and I try.

1115
01:17:03,029 --> 01:17:04,869
- Davis, there you are!
- Mr. Moseby.

1116
01:17:04,949 --> 01:17:06,789
It was great talking,
Aunt Bea.

1117
01:17:06,869 --> 01:17:09,509
- Where's Gwen's dad?
- Let's take a look.

1118
01:17:09,589 --> 01:17:13,989
Talk to me, sweetheart.
What is it?

1119
01:17:14,069 --> 01:17:18,029
He's such a lovely young man,
with a beautiful house...

1120
01:17:18,109 --> 01:17:20,149
and a wonderful family.

1121
01:17:20,229 --> 01:17:22,069
What's the matter?

1122
01:17:24,390 --> 01:17:27,189
It's all gonna end.

1123
01:17:27,270 --> 01:17:29,989
What is,
sweetheart?

1124
01:17:30,069 --> 01:17:32,589
You wouldn't understand, Mom.
Now, go away.

1125
01:17:32,669 --> 01:17:35,869
I wouldn't understand?
Your own mother?

1126
01:17:35,949 --> 01:17:37,949
Please, Gwen,
don't shut me out.

1127
01:17:37,949 --> 01:17:40,030
Don't keep shutting me
out of your life.

1128
01:17:40,109 --> 01:17:45,669
Don't treat me like a stranger,
someone you just met on the street.

1129
01:17:49,350 --> 01:17:52,269
Is one of these guys
Gwen's dad?

1130
01:17:52,349 --> 01:17:54,829
- Gee, I don't know.
It was 40 years ago. Hi.

1131
01:17:54,829 --> 01:17:55,629
Hi, Newton.

1132
01:17:55,709 --> 01:17:57,590
- I think maybe this guy?
- That guy?

1133
01:17:57,629 --> 01:18:01,229
No, not that guy.
These are all old men now.

1134
01:18:01,309 --> 01:18:04,990
Not old men. But let's,
let's go look for him up in the loft.

1135
01:18:09,869 --> 01:18:12,909
You're breaking your mother's heart,
young lady!

1136
01:18:12,989 --> 01:18:16,269
- Don't yell at her.
- She's my daughter too.

1137
01:18:16,349 --> 01:18:18,749
She probably locked herself
in the bedroom...

1138
01:18:18,829 --> 01:18:21,829
because she didn't wanna
watch you get drunk!

1139
01:18:21,909 --> 01:18:25,789
So, it's my fault, is it?
That's right, always blame me.

1140
01:18:25,869 --> 01:18:28,590
- It's not like you were a lousy mother.
- Bernie.

1141
01:18:28,669 --> 01:18:32,229
You wanna see drinking,
I'll show you drinking.

1142
01:18:32,269 --> 01:18:36,829
Oh no.

1143
01:18:41,189 --> 01:18:44,469
Both bookcases are counterweighted
so they can pivot easily,

1144
01:18:44,549 --> 01:18:47,230
- enabling the entire room to be opened up.
- Hmm.

1145
01:18:47,269 --> 01:18:49,150
Where's Gwen's dad
and Gwen?

1146
01:18:49,189 --> 01:18:52,870
They might be in the kitchen.
I wanted to show the kitchen...

1147
01:18:52,949 --> 01:18:55,190
because a lot of architects
forget about the kitchen.

1148
01:18:57,909 --> 01:19:00,869
Gwen?

1149
01:19:02,709 --> 01:19:07,029
I don't know what all the situation
is between you and your folks,

1150
01:19:07,109 --> 01:19:09,109
or between you and Newton,
for that matter.

1151
01:19:09,190 --> 01:19:11,869
So, I can't
give you advise.

1152
01:19:11,949 --> 01:19:15,109
I won't tell you
what to do.

1153
01:19:15,189 --> 01:19:19,629
I, I can only say,
we love you, Gwen.

1154
01:19:19,669 --> 01:19:23,590
You're family now.

1155
01:19:23,669 --> 01:19:27,909
I don't know if that
means anything anymore.

1156
01:19:27,989 --> 01:19:30,990
But, we're here for you,
sweetheart,

1157
01:19:31,069 --> 01:19:33,669
if you need us.

1158
01:19:37,749 --> 01:19:40,229
You are still
in there, aren't you?

1159
01:19:45,909 --> 01:19:48,749
With the furnace positioned that way,
the duct work is minimized.

1160
01:19:48,830 --> 01:19:51,629
- I want to show you the front closet.
- You don't think they're in there?

1161
01:19:51,710 --> 01:19:53,549
- No, no.
- Hi, Newton.

1162
01:19:53,630 --> 01:19:55,989
How were you able to do this
on your salary?

1163
01:19:56,069 --> 01:19:59,909
Mainly I borrowed from my dad.
You know how he and I are.

1164
01:20:02,989 --> 01:20:06,709
- I wanna show you the windows.
- Moseby!

1165
01:20:06,790 --> 01:20:10,389
- Yes?
- Assistant Gunner's Mate, Bernard Dunckle.

1166
01:20:10,429 --> 01:20:14,429
- U.S.S. Pennsylvania.
- Seaman Third Class, Winston Moseby.

1167
01:20:14,509 --> 01:20:17,669
This is great.
Your face is familiar.

1168
01:20:17,749 --> 01:20:21,549
- I was thinking the same about you.
- I'm just gonna say one word.

1169
01:20:21,629 --> 01:20:24,149
- "Midway."
- Oh, what a night!

1170
01:20:24,229 --> 01:20:26,509
We got hit midships
by a torpedo.

1171
01:20:26,589 --> 01:20:28,629
Just then a Japanese zero
comes in real low.

1172
01:20:28,709 --> 01:20:31,109
I get him in my sights,
flames all around.

1173
01:20:31,189 --> 01:20:35,149
Gun's so hot I can hardly handle it.
Rat-tat-tat, rat-tat-tat.

1174
01:20:35,229 --> 01:20:38,109
I get him! Take that,
you motherless son of Hirohito!

1175
01:20:38,189 --> 01:20:40,029
Then we spot
another one!

1176
01:20:40,109 --> 01:20:43,830
- We weren't attacked by zeroes!
- You calling me a liar?

1177
01:20:43,909 --> 01:20:47,069
- Oh no.
- Son, I think you should talk to Gwen.

1178
01:20:47,110 --> 01:20:49,389
- Whose side were you on?
- I can't now.

1179
01:20:49,429 --> 01:20:52,229
- It's important you talk to her.
- Who won the '43 world series?

1180
01:20:52,309 --> 01:20:53,749
- Bernie. Pop!
- Newton!

1181
01:20:53,830 --> 01:20:56,229
- Daddy!
- Gwen!

1182
01:21:04,670 --> 01:21:07,309
Winston, hi.
That's not what happened at all.

1183
01:21:07,389 --> 01:21:09,269
- It isn't?
- No. I mean...

1184
01:21:09,309 --> 01:21:13,229
Dad went through quite a lot during...
you know, the big one.

1185
01:21:13,310 --> 01:21:16,149
Iwo?

1186
01:21:16,229 --> 01:21:18,110
Happened to
a lot of good men.

1187
01:21:18,189 --> 01:21:19,909
Yeah!

1188
01:21:19,989 --> 01:21:22,189
- I wanted to show you...
- So beautiful!

1189
01:21:22,269 --> 01:21:25,829
- Uh-huh. - Davis, would you
sing "Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral"?

1190
01:21:25,909 --> 01:21:28,029
- What?
- This would be the perfect time.

1191
01:21:28,109 --> 01:21:32,669
I was so moved by that story when you
brought tears to your father's eyes.

1192
01:21:32,749 --> 01:21:36,829
- No, no, no.
- It would mean a great deal to me.

1193
01:21:43,229 --> 01:21:46,709
Davis has consented
to sing a song...

1194
01:21:46,790 --> 01:21:49,149
which is very special
to him and his dad.

1195
01:21:49,229 --> 01:21:52,149
Come on, sing.

1196
01:22:28,469 --> 01:22:36,909
¶ Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral ¶

1197
01:22:36,990 --> 01:22:41,469
¶ Too-ra-loo-ra-lie ¶

1198
01:22:43,710 --> 01:22:49,829
¶ Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral ¶

1199
01:22:49,909 --> 01:22:55,589
¶ Hush now
don't ye cry ¶

1200
01:22:57,989 --> 01:23:05,029
¶ Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral ¶

1201
01:23:05,069 --> 01:23:12,309
¶ Too-ra-loo-ra-lie ¶

1202
01:23:14,469 --> 01:23:21,069
¶ Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral ¶

1203
01:23:22,429 --> 01:23:26,469
¶ It's an Irish ¶

1204
01:23:26,469 --> 01:23:35,069
¶ Lullaby ¶¶

1205
01:23:58,109 --> 01:24:00,309
Sing "Roll out
the barrel."

1206
01:24:00,389 --> 01:24:01,989
Put a lid on it,
will you, Mom?

1207
01:24:02,069 --> 01:24:05,629
Don't take that tone of voice
with your mother. Show some respect.

1208
01:24:05,709 --> 01:24:08,669
Winston.

1209
01:24:08,750 --> 01:24:11,429
Why, thank you, Bernie.

1210
01:24:16,430 --> 01:24:18,269
Something funny?

1211
01:24:20,229 --> 01:24:22,629
Oh, we were just
telling "Davis" stories.

1212
01:24:22,669 --> 01:24:25,149
Oh, how fun!

1213
01:24:26,229 --> 01:24:28,549
Davis! Davis!

1214
01:24:28,630 --> 01:24:32,709
Do you remember that time you built that
tree house in my parent's backyard?

1215
01:24:32,789 --> 01:24:36,590
- It was so incredible.
- Davis built me a tree house.

1216
01:24:36,669 --> 01:24:38,149
He did?

1217
01:24:38,230 --> 01:24:40,669
Yes, on our
honeymoon night.

1218
01:24:40,749 --> 01:24:43,749
- Really? - Uh-hmm. In a big
tree up in the Boston Common.

1219
01:24:43,829 --> 01:24:47,869
The cops didn't stop you hammering away
in the middle of Boston Common?

1220
01:24:47,949 --> 01:24:49,949
Remember you used to play
a concertina?

1221
01:24:50,030 --> 01:24:51,869
Davis?

1222
01:24:51,950 --> 01:24:55,469
I prefabricated the panels and secured
it to the trees with cable suspension.

1223
01:24:55,510 --> 01:24:57,349
Isn't he the greatest?

1224
01:24:57,430 --> 01:24:59,749
What line of work
are you in, Bernie?

1225
01:24:59,829 --> 01:25:01,830
- I'm retired.
- Oh? From what?

1226
01:25:01,909 --> 01:25:05,429
From all the big,
hairy bullshit.

1227
01:25:07,749 --> 01:25:10,029
Davis, do you remember
our adventure walks?

1228
01:25:10,109 --> 01:25:13,429
- Huh? Oh, yeah.
- This one time...

1229
01:25:13,509 --> 01:25:15,270
we went lookin' for
a crashed meteor.

1230
01:25:15,349 --> 01:25:18,389
Son, could we
speak to you a second?

1231
01:25:18,469 --> 01:25:20,309
We've been
talking with Mary...

1232
01:25:20,389 --> 01:25:22,629
and she wants to get
back together with Bernie.

1233
01:25:22,709 --> 01:25:25,669
Your father and I were thinking,
if they could be close to Gwen...

1234
01:25:25,749 --> 01:25:27,629
- Like we're close to you.
- Right.

1235
01:25:27,669 --> 01:25:30,829
Well, I'll, I'll build them
a cottage across the pond.

1236
01:25:30,910 --> 01:25:35,389
Davis, did we or did we not adventure
walk from Manhattan to Boston?

1237
01:25:35,469 --> 01:25:37,429
- Yes, we did.
- Satisfied?

1238
01:25:37,509 --> 01:25:40,749
- I never said you didn't.
- Ha! Like hell!

1239
01:25:40,790 --> 01:25:42,909
Do you think,
for instance,

1240
01:25:42,989 --> 01:25:47,389
that this boy could have designed
a house as creative as this...

1241
01:25:47,469 --> 01:25:51,669
on a corporate,
kiss-ass committee?

1242
01:25:51,709 --> 01:25:56,069
All I said was that you and Davis
are well-suited for each other.

1243
01:25:56,150 --> 01:26:00,149
- I know what that means.
- I meant you're both creative.

1244
01:26:00,229 --> 01:26:03,589
In other words, we're both liars.
I hope you're hearing this.

1245
01:26:03,669 --> 01:26:06,549
- Sweetheart!
- Are you listening to what she's saying?

1246
01:26:06,629 --> 01:26:10,029
- I don't hear anything.
- That's exactly the problem.

1247
01:26:10,109 --> 01:26:12,629
You don't hear and
you don't see.

1248
01:26:12,709 --> 01:26:17,229
Don't you think I know
you're in love with my husband?

1249
01:26:17,309 --> 01:26:21,629
Do you think I don't know about your sympathy
for him for having a fruitcake like me?

1250
01:26:21,669 --> 01:26:25,469
You had your chance.
You had it building your tree house,

1251
01:26:25,549 --> 01:26:30,469
on adventure walks and on the day he
offered you this house, and you blew it.

1252
01:26:30,549 --> 01:26:32,630
I'm the one
who found him.

1253
01:26:32,709 --> 01:26:37,549
I'm the one who knows what he's worth
and you're the one he wants.

1254
01:26:44,150 --> 01:26:47,629
You're the one he wants,
goddamnit!

1255
01:26:54,949 --> 01:26:59,110
I, I'm sorry.
I, I better go after her.

1256
01:27:02,469 --> 01:27:06,549
- Davis!
- I'm sorry about this and about my father.

1257
01:27:06,629 --> 01:27:10,229
I remember Bernie.
He was always that way.

1258
01:27:10,309 --> 01:27:13,149
I don't know what's going on,
but keep this in mind.

1259
01:27:13,189 --> 01:27:17,750
I wouldn't have seen this house if it weren't
for that wife or giving you the promotion...

1260
01:27:17,829 --> 01:27:21,549
if I hadn't seen
this house.

1261
01:27:33,950 --> 01:27:36,550
You are the best.
It was miraculous!

1262
01:27:36,589 --> 01:27:39,029
I got the promotion.

1263
01:27:39,069 --> 01:27:41,750
- Can I have your handkerchief, please?
- What?

1264
01:27:41,829 --> 01:27:44,269
Oh, yeah, right.

1265
01:27:47,869 --> 01:27:51,589
It all looked so hopeless,
especially between Becky and your dad,

1266
01:27:51,669 --> 01:27:53,589
I mean, Ralph.

1267
01:27:53,669 --> 01:27:55,989
In one stroke,
you fixed everything.

1268
01:27:56,069 --> 01:28:01,069
Smashing the gifts was a bit over
the top but who am I to complain?

1269
01:28:01,149 --> 01:28:03,509
You did it, Gwen.
You did it!

1270
01:28:03,589 --> 01:28:07,109
- I want this marriage to work.
- What?

1271
01:28:07,189 --> 01:28:10,029
You heard me, damn it.
Was Maui nothing to you?

1272
01:28:10,109 --> 01:28:14,429
Or Boomer, the way we were able to work
that out? Okay, we had counseling.

1273
01:28:14,509 --> 01:28:16,870
I'm not saying
everything is perfect...

1274
01:28:16,949 --> 01:28:20,229
but I really think
this marriage is worth saving.

1275
01:28:20,310 --> 01:28:22,509
What marriage?

1276
01:28:27,909 --> 01:28:29,749
Gwen?

1277
01:28:30,909 --> 01:28:32,549
Gwen.

1278
01:28:34,469 --> 01:28:36,749
Would you mind taking me
into town, please?

1279
01:28:36,789 --> 01:28:39,429
- Sure.
- Thank you.

1280
01:28:39,469 --> 01:28:41,830
Gwen!

1281
01:28:44,629 --> 01:28:47,309
Gwen!

1282
01:29:17,230 --> 01:29:22,069
- She left me. She left me, Becky.
- Oh, Davis.

1283
01:29:22,109 --> 01:29:24,029
I don't know
what got into her.

1284
01:29:24,069 --> 01:29:27,349
I thought the relationship
was going fine. I, I really did.

1285
01:29:27,429 --> 01:29:29,909
You tried.
You did your best.

1286
01:29:29,949 --> 01:29:31,869
I was never
dishonest with her.

1287
01:29:31,949 --> 01:29:35,389
I always told her the truth
about you, everything.

1288
01:29:35,470 --> 01:29:37,670
Davis?

1289
01:29:37,749 --> 01:29:41,189
Was it true about the way
you met her in the hospital,

1290
01:29:41,230 --> 01:29:43,509
about the way
you got married,

1291
01:29:43,589 --> 01:29:46,149
the trip to Maui and
building that tree house?

1292
01:29:59,429 --> 01:30:01,869
Look at me,
I'm crying like an idiot.

1293
01:30:01,949 --> 01:30:04,149
Oh, of course
you're crying.

1294
01:30:04,189 --> 01:30:07,669
I mean, I'm really...
God, Becky!

1295
01:30:07,749 --> 01:30:10,069
Oh, Davis.

1296
01:30:10,149 --> 01:30:14,469
Just tell me the truth.

1297
01:30:21,150 --> 01:30:23,470
- Becky?
- Yes?

1298
01:30:23,509 --> 01:30:27,109
Everything she said
was true.

1299
01:30:34,389 --> 01:30:36,949
Gwen!
Gwen!

1300
01:30:36,989 --> 01:30:40,269
Gwen, Gwen!

1301
01:30:43,429 --> 01:30:46,229
I love you, Gwen.
I wanna marry you.

1302
01:30:46,309 --> 01:30:49,109
Is that it?

1303
01:30:49,149 --> 01:30:51,229
Well, yeah.

1304
01:30:54,149 --> 01:30:55,949
Look, Davis, we're not
right for each other.

1305
01:30:56,029 --> 01:30:58,789
- What?
- I can see that now.

1306
01:30:58,870 --> 01:31:01,309
I don't want you to feel bad
about any of this.

1307
01:31:01,389 --> 01:31:04,949
You were really kind of decent to me,
most of the time.

1308
01:31:05,030 --> 01:31:07,749
I can change, Gwen.
I can live in a make-believe world.

1309
01:31:07,829 --> 01:31:11,949
Hell, I already was. Half the things
we tell ourselves are fiction.

1310
01:31:12,030 --> 01:31:13,989
The only thing I know that's real
is that I love you.

1311
01:31:14,069 --> 01:31:16,349
I used to think
that was enough too.

1312
01:31:16,389 --> 01:31:20,549
- Isn't it?
- Step aboard, please.

1313
01:31:20,589 --> 01:31:22,349
Wait!

1314
01:31:22,389 --> 01:31:27,069
Don't you remember the time I had myself
delivered to you in a box for your birthday?

1315
01:31:27,110 --> 01:31:29,629
And how the guy I paid
screwed up...

1316
01:31:29,709 --> 01:31:31,949
and delivered me
to the wrong apartment?

1317
01:31:31,989 --> 01:31:35,269
And how the lady
who opened the box...

1318
01:31:35,309 --> 01:31:37,029
freaked out and
started screaming?

1319
01:31:37,109 --> 01:31:40,550
And I ran out just as you
poked your head into the hall.

1320
01:31:40,629 --> 01:31:44,709
The next thing I know, this one's
bashing me for having an affair...

1321
01:31:44,749 --> 01:31:47,069
and this one's bashing me
for being some kind of...

1322
01:31:47,150 --> 01:31:49,829
gift-wrapped pervert?

1323
01:31:49,909 --> 01:31:53,989
All I had to protect myself
was a dozen roses.

1324
01:31:54,069 --> 01:31:56,389
And you never even
read the note.

1325
01:31:57,749 --> 01:31:59,589
What did
the note say?

1326
01:31:59,669 --> 01:32:04,629
I'll tell you what it said.
It said...

1327
01:32:09,230 --> 01:32:11,550
Marry me, Gwen.
I'm lost without you.

1328
01:32:36,829 --> 01:32:38,669
What about my parents?

1329
01:33:23,710 --> 01:33:26,709
I love you, Gwen.

1330
01:33:26,789 --> 01:33:29,389
Actually, it's Jessica.
