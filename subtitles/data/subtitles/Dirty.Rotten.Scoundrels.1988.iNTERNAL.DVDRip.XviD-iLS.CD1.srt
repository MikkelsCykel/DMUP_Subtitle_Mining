1
00:00:33,796 --> 00:00:37,995
Your Highness, please allow
me to make this little contribution.

2
00:00:38,115 --> 00:00:40,396
No, I cannot accept it.

3
00:00:40,516 --> 00:00:42,916
But think of what these
could do for your cause.

4
00:00:43,116 --> 00:00:46,516
Even though I know they would mean
freedom for many of my people...

5
00:00:46,716 --> 00:00:49,916
...I will not take them.
- Please. Please!

6
00:00:50,516 --> 00:00:54,396
- These could save the lives of many men.
- The men of my country are proud.

7
00:00:54,516 --> 00:00:57,596
They would die rather than have
their prince accept charity.

8
00:00:57,716 --> 00:01:01,116
Then think of the lives
of the women, the mothers...

9
00:01:01,316 --> 00:01:03,796
The women of my country
fight alongside the men.

10
00:01:03,916 --> 00:01:06,515
They are also too proud to accept charity.

11
00:01:07,516 --> 00:01:10,195
Then consider the lives of the children.

12
00:01:10,395 --> 00:01:12,596
The innocent children.

13
00:01:14,796 --> 00:01:17,116
But... for the children.

14
00:03:29,115 --> 00:03:31,795
She's the blonde
in the blue sequinned dress.

15
00:03:31,915 --> 00:03:35,116
Extremely rich, very married...

16
00:03:35,196 --> 00:03:38,516
...eminently corruptible
and a willing infidel.

17
00:03:45,995 --> 00:03:47,916
Perfect.

18
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:05,796
<i>Faites vos jeux!</i>

19
00:04:16,315 --> 00:04:18,195
<i>Rien ne va plus!</i>

20
00:04:25,396 --> 00:04:26,995
<i>Sept rouge, inpair et manque!</i>

21
00:04:36,796 --> 00:04:38,716
<i>Faites vos jeux, messieurs!</i>

22
00:04:39,396 --> 00:04:42,396
Monsieur Andre, would you see
what you can get for this?

23
00:04:42,795 --> 00:04:45,795
- Not the royal ring, Your Highness?
- Sh!

24
00:04:45,915 --> 00:04:47,995
Do you want the whole world to know?

25
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:10,116
Excuse me.
Is that man there truly royalty?

26
00:05:11,596 --> 00:05:14,315
- No, madame.
- But you called him "Your Highness".

27
00:05:14,516 --> 00:05:16,515
It was a faux pas. Please forget it.

28
00:05:16,596 --> 00:05:18,715
You can trust me, I won't tell.

29
00:05:20,115 --> 00:05:23,316
Madame, I am the police chief
of Beaumont-sur-Mer.

30
00:05:23,516 --> 00:05:26,596
What makes you Americans
think you can buy anyone at any price?

31
00:05:26,716 --> 00:05:28,796
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- No!

32
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:32,195
- I've already caused the prince enough...
- Prince?

33
00:05:34,515 --> 00:05:37,916
He sounded like he was in trouble.
Perhaps I can help.

34
00:05:38,116 --> 00:05:42,196
If you really want to help, forget
everything that you have seen and heard.

35
00:05:42,395 --> 00:05:44,515
Forget the very existence...

36
00:05:44,595 --> 00:05:47,716
...of that brilliant, extraordinary man...

37
00:05:48,595 --> 00:05:50,595
...of destiny.

38
00:05:57,795 --> 00:05:59,796
Your Highness...

39
00:06:01,115 --> 00:06:04,515
Your Highness, don't be alarmed.
I can be trusted.

40
00:06:04,715 --> 00:06:07,916
- Are you one of my subjects?
- No. I'm an American.

41
00:06:07,996 --> 00:06:09,996
Fanny Eubanks of Omaha.

42
00:06:11,116 --> 00:06:14,996
I couldn't help overhearing.
If you're in trouble and I can help...

43
00:06:15,195 --> 00:06:18,195
Thank you. But I cannot accept.

44
00:06:18,395 --> 00:06:20,995
You've already risked
too much just in speaking to me.

45
00:06:21,195 --> 00:06:23,115
I still wanna help.

46
00:06:26,715 --> 00:06:30,196
You must understand.
I have powerful enemies.

47
00:06:30,395 --> 00:06:33,116
They may be watching even as we...

48
00:06:33,595 --> 00:06:35,595
My God, you're attractive.

49
00:06:37,195 --> 00:06:39,315
It's late.

50
00:06:41,795 --> 00:06:43,995
I must go.

51
00:06:49,195 --> 00:06:51,795
- Has he left?
- Yes. Just a moment ago.

52
00:06:51,915 --> 00:06:53,596
Good.

53
00:06:53,716 --> 00:06:57,316
Please. You must tell me where he lives.

54
00:07:00,315 --> 00:07:04,715
- I feel it only fair to warn you...
- I know he has powerful enemies.

55
00:07:05,115 --> 00:07:07,515
There may also be an emotional risk.

56
00:07:08,315 --> 00:07:12,115
You see, His Highness has
been a widower for five years.

57
00:07:12,915 --> 00:07:15,196
For five years?

58
00:07:19,915 --> 00:07:21,915
Please, Your Highness.

59
00:07:22,715 --> 00:07:26,116
Fanny... the Freedom Fighters thank you.

60
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:31,916
This is for the overhead.

61
00:07:32,115 --> 00:07:34,195
This goes to you, Arthur.

62
00:07:34,395 --> 00:07:36,795
This goes to you, Andre.

63
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:40,716
This goes to me...
which means it's time to go to Zurich.

64
00:08:40,315 --> 00:08:42,595
Excuse me. May I sit here, please?

65
00:08:43,396 --> 00:08:45,396
- If you like.
- Thank you.

66
00:08:46,715 --> 00:08:49,595
Good evening, sir.
Would you like to see the menu?

67
00:08:49,715 --> 00:08:52,195
Oh, yes. I'm starving.

68
00:08:52,315 --> 00:08:53,515
Really starving.

69
00:08:57,114 --> 00:08:59,195
Oh! Prices.

70
00:08:59,595 --> 00:09:01,596
Woo!

71
00:09:02,795 --> 00:09:05,196
I think I'll just have some water.

72
00:09:05,315 --> 00:09:07,315
- Water?
- Yes.

73
00:09:12,996 --> 00:09:15,316
Only water? But you seemed so hungry.

74
00:09:16,915 --> 00:09:19,996
I'm saving my money
for something special.

75
00:09:20,115 --> 00:09:22,115
- My mother.
- Your mother?

76
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:26,795
Well, she's not really my mother.
Actually, she's my grandmother.

77
00:09:26,915 --> 00:09:28,795
But she raised me.

78
00:09:30,116 --> 00:09:33,795
My real parents... didn't want me.

79
00:09:34,595 --> 00:09:37,795
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- But my grandmother is wonderful.

80
00:09:37,915 --> 00:09:41,795
She has a laugh
that can make the birds sing.

81
00:09:44,796 --> 00:09:49,915
But she's been quite ill lately... and
the hospital bills have been adding up.

82
00:09:50,395 --> 00:09:52,595
I just wanna do my share.

83
00:09:53,115 --> 00:09:56,515
It's kinda tough for me because
I was never very good with money.

84
00:09:56,715 --> 00:10:01,715
I just seem to take what the Red Cross
pays me and I give it right back to them.

85
00:10:03,515 --> 00:10:06,315
But I am going to help my gram-gram.

86
00:10:08,115 --> 00:10:13,595
She is the one who taught me
it is better to be truthful and good...

87
00:10:15,116 --> 00:10:16,995
...than to not.

88
00:10:26,114 --> 00:10:29,115
- Waiter!
- What are you doing?

89
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:31,195
Waiter.

90
00:10:33,115 --> 00:10:36,115
- Give this man whatever he wants.
- I can't let you buy me a meal!

91
00:10:36,315 --> 00:10:37,595
Nonsense.

92
00:10:40,715 --> 00:10:44,395
I'll have a double turkey sandwich
on white, fries, a large knockwurst...

93
00:10:44,595 --> 00:10:47,196
...three bags of chips,
a chocolate milk and two beers.

94
00:10:47,316 --> 00:10:49,595
Why don't you have a beer? Three beers.

95
00:10:49,796 --> 00:10:50,995
Thank you.

96
00:11:12,515 --> 00:11:14,794
Forgot I had a first-class ticket.

97
00:11:19,795 --> 00:11:21,715
- That bother you?
- No.

98
00:11:23,515 --> 00:11:27,995
# I love to love you in the night...

99
00:11:28,114 --> 00:11:31,595
I couldn't help overhearing
your conversation in the dining car.

100
00:11:31,714 --> 00:11:34,116
My condolences to your grandmother.

101
00:11:34,315 --> 00:11:35,196
Huh?

102
00:11:35,315 --> 00:11:36,315
Oh!

103
00:11:37,195 --> 00:11:40,115
Oh... right

104
00:11:40,995 --> 00:11:43,115
Didn't you say she was taken ill?

105
00:11:43,314 --> 00:11:46,595
I tell 'em what they wanna hear
if it gets me what I want.

106
00:11:48,115 --> 00:11:50,115
Rather a shabby trick, isn't it?

107
00:11:52,115 --> 00:11:55,395
I can tell you've got
a lot to learn about women.

108
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:59,315
Yes, I'm afraid I am a bit naive
when it comes to the weaker sex.

109
00:12:05,115 --> 00:12:06,995
Freddy Benson.

110
00:12:08,315 --> 00:12:11,795
- And you are?
- Lawrence Jamieson.

111
00:12:14,314 --> 00:12:17,115
- You're married, aren't you?
- You can tell?

112
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:20,915
Listen.

113
00:12:20,996 --> 00:12:23,795
We're the weaker sex.
Men don't live as long as women.

114
00:12:23,995 --> 00:12:27,795
We get more heart attacks,
more strokes, more prostate trouble.

115
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:30,514
I say it's time for a change.

116
00:12:30,715 --> 00:12:34,316
I say let them give us money.
Let's live off them for a while.

117
00:12:35,515 --> 00:12:37,715
That probably shocks
a guy like you, right?

118
00:12:37,795 --> 00:12:40,515
Well, it's rather a revolutionary thought.

119
00:12:40,715 --> 00:12:43,195
Do you really think it's possible?

120
00:12:44,395 --> 00:12:47,315
Look what I did in the dining car!
She gave me 100 francs.

121
00:12:47,514 --> 00:12:50,115
That's like, uh... 20 bucks!

122
00:12:50,515 --> 00:12:54,195
Do you have any idea what it feels like
to take a woman for 20 bucks?

123
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:57,395
No, I haven't.
I'm afraid it's a little out of my class.

124
00:12:59,994 --> 00:13:01,995
- What?
- It's too bad.

125
00:13:02,194 --> 00:13:04,794
We could've had a blast on the Riviera.

126
00:13:09,595 --> 00:13:11,715
- You're headed for the Riviera?
- Yeah.

127
00:13:11,795 --> 00:13:15,515
There's a little town there, supposed
to be crawling with rich women.

128
00:13:15,715 --> 00:13:17,915
Oh. And what town is that?

129
00:13:19,115 --> 00:13:21,395
Uh... Beaumont-sur-Mer.

130
00:13:23,315 --> 00:13:25,795
Beaumont-sur-Mer?

131
00:13:25,915 --> 00:13:27,995
I'm afraid you've been misinformed.

132
00:13:28,115 --> 00:13:33,115
Beaumont used to be lively, but it's been
taken over by older, retired couples.

133
00:13:33,194 --> 00:13:36,395
- Older, retired couples? Are you sure?
- Yes, I live there.

134
00:13:36,595 --> 00:13:38,995
I'm considered to be the town's playboy.

135
00:13:41,715 --> 00:13:44,995
All the social activity
has gone to the Italian Riviera.

136
00:13:45,114 --> 00:13:46,994
Portofino.

137
00:13:49,394 --> 00:13:53,515
Still doesn't hurt to check it out. Some
of these sleepy towns really pay off.

138
00:13:55,595 --> 00:13:59,195
Would you excuse me?
I have to phone my wife and children.

139
00:13:59,395 --> 00:14:01,994
I like to let them know
what time I'm arriving.

140
00:14:02,114 --> 00:14:06,194
- They really got you on a leash.
- Afraid so.

141
00:14:31,314 --> 00:14:33,195
Well, here we are.

142
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:44,395
Older, retired couples?

143
00:14:44,515 --> 00:14:46,514
- You have a ride into town?
- Yes, I have.

144
00:14:46,595 --> 00:14:49,394
- Great. You can give me lift.
- Do you have a hotel room?

145
00:14:49,515 --> 00:14:53,514
- I never make reservations.
- Excuse me. Is this the Portofino train?

146
00:14:53,594 --> 00:14:56,595
Yes, it is. But we're getting off, right?

147
00:14:56,715 --> 00:14:58,714
<i>Scusi.</i>

148
00:15:01,715 --> 00:15:03,794
- We're getting off, right?
- Uh...

149
00:15:06,515 --> 00:15:07,794
Gee.

150
00:15:08,314 --> 00:15:11,115
- How far up is Portofino?
- Portofino?

151
00:15:11,195 --> 00:15:13,995
It's about 170km. I live there.

152
00:15:14,395 --> 00:15:16,395
- No!
- Yes!

153
00:15:17,114 --> 00:15:19,714
Come and stay with me.
You can go to Portofino later.

154
00:15:19,795 --> 00:15:23,194
I would love to, but my grandmother
is there and she's expecting me.

155
00:15:23,394 --> 00:15:27,915
- Your grandmother is living in Portofino?
- Yes. Actually, she's quite ill.

156
00:15:27,995 --> 00:15:32,314
Well, good luck. Give my best to your
grandmother. I hope her health improves.

157
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:33,994
<i>- Ciao.
- Ciao.</i>

158
00:15:34,114 --> 00:15:36,115
<i>Ciao.</i>

159
00:15:46,594 --> 00:15:48,914
Your phone call did not
give me much time.

160
00:15:48,995 --> 00:15:50,915
Marion was perfect.

161
00:15:51,114 --> 00:15:53,794
Make sure she gets back all right, Andre.

162
00:15:55,194 --> 00:15:57,595
May I ask why she was necessary?

163
00:15:57,715 --> 00:16:00,595
I needed a decoy.
This idiot was sharing my compartment.

164
00:16:00,714 --> 00:16:03,115
He fancied himself as a bit of a player.

165
00:16:03,194 --> 00:16:06,114
Said he was going to do
some hunting in my Beaumont-sur-Mer.

166
00:16:06,194 --> 00:16:09,514
Monsieur Lawrence,
you can afford to dismiss such amateurs.

167
00:16:09,714 --> 00:16:13,314
- Surely he was no match for you?
- You can't be too careful, Andre.

168
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:16,795
A poacher who shoots at rabbits
may scare big game away.

169
00:16:35,714 --> 00:16:37,994
Hey, Lawrence, listen to this.

170
00:16:38,515 --> 00:16:42,715
"A clever, young American con artist,
nicknamed The Jackal...

171
00:16:43,315 --> 00:16:45,595
...has been working Western Europe. "

172
00:16:46,715 --> 00:16:49,595
If he's in the papers,
how clever can he be?

173
00:16:49,714 --> 00:16:53,714
Now, to business. Krista Knudsen.

174
00:16:54,994 --> 00:16:58,995
Widow of Lars Knudsen,
the Danish match king.

175
00:17:02,515 --> 00:17:05,115
She left the Excelsior Hotel in Genoa...

176
00:17:05,194 --> 00:17:09,194
...at 0740 hours this morning
in a white Ferrari.

177
00:17:09,394 --> 00:17:12,114
She should be arriving at approximately...

178
00:17:12,714 --> 00:17:14,395
Ah-hah!

179
00:17:14,515 --> 00:17:16,515
Here she is now.

180
00:17:19,314 --> 00:17:22,194
I would like
to help your grandmother.

181
00:17:22,314 --> 00:17:26,314
- I got some money here.
- Oh, no. No, I wouldn't accept it.

182
00:17:26,514 --> 00:17:29,515
That's strange.
There's a young man with her.

183
00:17:30,715 --> 00:17:33,795
- Please, I insist. I insist.
- I'm gonna pay you back.

184
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:37,514
- The poacher?
- Yes.

185
00:17:37,594 --> 00:17:40,515
And he's no longer satisfied with rabbits.

186
00:17:41,114 --> 00:17:45,194
Monsieur Police Inspector,
can you arrange something for me?

187
00:17:45,395 --> 00:17:48,595
- I'm gonna pay you back, though.
- No!

188
00:17:49,395 --> 00:17:51,315
The usual?

189
00:17:56,194 --> 00:17:57,314
<i>Bonjour!</i>

190
00:17:58,114 --> 00:18:00,115
<i>Bonjour!</i>

191
00:18:05,315 --> 00:18:07,194
<i>Bonjour!</i>

192
00:18:07,915 --> 00:18:10,194
Hey! Encore, encore!

193
00:18:27,194 --> 00:18:29,114
Yee-ha!

194
00:18:35,195 --> 00:18:37,115
Monsieur!

195
00:18:38,515 --> 00:18:40,394
<i>Merci.</i>

196
00:18:44,714 --> 00:18:48,195
Something like this, OK?
All right, here we go! Here we go!

197
00:18:50,594 --> 00:18:53,514
OK. Two more! Two more.
How much is it?

198
00:18:57,994 --> 00:19:00,114
Have you seen enough, Mrs Knudsen?

199
00:19:00,594 --> 00:19:03,794
That money was to go toward
an operation for his grandmother!

200
00:19:04,115 --> 00:19:06,114
Here we go! Ha ha haa!

201
00:19:07,794 --> 00:19:11,794
He's a confidence man. A trickster.
Will Madame sign the complaint?

202
00:19:12,794 --> 00:19:14,593
Gladly.

203
00:19:19,195 --> 00:19:22,194
I told you, I didn't steal any money
from her! She gave it to me.

204
00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:24,394
She filed this complaint against you.

205
00:19:24,514 --> 00:19:28,594
She caught me with another woman.
You're French, you understand that!

206
00:19:28,714 --> 00:19:31,114
To be with another woman, that is French.

207
00:19:31,314 --> 00:19:33,114
To be caught, that is American.

208
00:19:33,195 --> 00:19:36,795
God! All right, what am I gonna do?
How am I gonna get out of here?

209
00:19:36,994 --> 00:19:41,514
It's very difficult. The charge is a serious
one and you are a vagrant, an unknown.

210
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:43,714
Listen, I'm not a vagrant!

211
00:19:43,914 --> 00:19:45,794
This is my point!

212
00:19:45,914 --> 00:19:50,394
I know somebody here.
I met him on a train. His name is...

213
00:19:54,714 --> 00:19:57,994
His name is... James... No.

214
00:19:58,195 --> 00:20:01,594
His name is... James Josephson.

215
00:20:01,714 --> 00:20:02,794
Oh, no, no!

216
00:20:02,914 --> 00:20:05,514
James Lawrence. Lawrence! Lawrence!

217
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:09,794
Lawrence...

218
00:20:10,515 --> 00:20:12,514
Lawrence Fells. Lawrence Fings.

219
00:20:13,514 --> 00:20:15,394
Forest Lawrenceton.

220
00:20:16,313 --> 00:20:18,994
La... Lars. Lars!

221
00:20:20,195 --> 00:20:24,394
Lawrence. Lawrence Lacko...

222
00:20:26,394 --> 00:20:28,314
Lawrence...

223
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:30,394
His name is James Jessenden.

224
00:20:30,514 --> 00:20:32,594
Lawrence Fells. Lawrence Jesterton.

225
00:20:32,714 --> 00:20:34,714
Lawrence Jesterton.

226
00:20:35,514 --> 00:20:37,515
- Lawrence Jamieson?
- Yes!

227
00:20:37,714 --> 00:20:41,914
Yes! Yes! We're like this!

228
00:20:49,714 --> 00:20:52,315
Freddy. This is really very serious.

229
00:20:53,514 --> 00:20:56,595
- They don't treat gigolos lightly in France.
- What do you mean?

230
00:20:56,794 --> 00:20:59,514
Until 75 years ago,
they were still castrating them.

231
00:20:59,594 --> 00:21:02,314
Don't say that word.

232
00:21:02,714 --> 00:21:06,315
- What do they do now?
- Well, that depends who the judge is.

233
00:21:07,395 --> 00:21:10,715
<i>- Inspecteur, qui est le juge?
- Reynoux.</i>

234
00:21:10,995 --> 00:21:13,195
Oh. Judge Reynoux.

235
00:21:16,114 --> 00:21:19,714
- Good luck, Freddy.
- No, no. You can't go. You gotta help me.

236
00:21:20,913 --> 00:21:24,514
- Do you have any money?
- Yeah, I got about 12... 900 dollars.

237
00:21:24,715 --> 00:21:26,994
No, I know this chap.
He'll want at least 5,000.

238
00:21:27,114 --> 00:21:28,794
5,000? I don't have 5,000!

239
00:21:29,114 --> 00:21:31,594
- Can you get it?
- I have it at home.

240
00:21:31,714 --> 00:21:34,193
- I could fly home and mail him a cheque.
- OK.

241
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:38,194
<i>- Inspecteur!
- Oui?</i>

242
00:21:38,314 --> 00:21:40,195
<i>Est-il possible...</i>

243
00:21:45,314 --> 00:21:48,714
<i>Non! Non, non, pas possible! Crétin!</i>

244
00:21:51,513 --> 00:21:53,394
Freddy.

245
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:57,994
He says you can go... Ah-ah-ah!

246
00:21:58,315 --> 00:22:01,114
He's got to have the rest
of the money within 48 hours...

247
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:06,194
...or he'll submit your name to Interpol
and you'll never travel in Europe again.

248
00:22:06,394 --> 00:22:08,995
That's fine, that's fine.
Thank you, thank you.

249
00:22:09,115 --> 00:22:11,394
Thank you, Lawrence Jamieson.

250
00:22:17,914 --> 00:22:20,394
You know, I'm pretty good
at sizing people up...

251
00:22:20,594 --> 00:22:23,194
...and I think you are one terrific guy.

252
00:22:23,395 --> 00:22:26,914
I suppose I get pleasure
from helping people like you out.

253
00:23:35,713 --> 00:23:38,794
- I see you know His Highness.
- Who?

254
00:23:40,194 --> 00:23:42,594
- The prince.
- The prince?

255
00:23:42,994 --> 00:23:46,114
I saw him shake your hand
and pat you on the back.

256
00:23:48,114 --> 00:23:50,114
No kidding!

257
00:23:50,194 --> 00:23:52,993
- And you are?
- Fanny Eubanks.

258
00:23:55,313 --> 00:23:58,114
Fanny Eubanks? Of Omaha?

259
00:23:59,395 --> 00:24:02,714
- Of Omaha?
- You don't have to cover up with me.

260
00:24:02,914 --> 00:24:06,794
It may be my money
that's financing your mission.

261
00:24:07,393 --> 00:24:10,113
You're financing my mission?

262
00:24:10,313 --> 00:24:12,394
Perhaps His Highness has mentioned me?

263
00:24:20,994 --> 00:24:24,194
<i>Oh, Lady Fanny of Omaha?</i>

264
00:24:24,393 --> 00:24:26,514
He called me Lady Fanny?

265
00:24:26,794 --> 00:24:31,594
Oh, yes. Lady Fanny of Omaha.
He speaks of you with great affection.

266
00:24:31,794 --> 00:24:33,714
Drink, sir?

267
00:24:37,994 --> 00:24:39,993
You have done a wonderful thing.

268
00:25:00,914 --> 00:25:02,394
Sir.

269
00:25:02,594 --> 00:25:06,794
Excuse me. I'm very sorry, sir,
but the man said it was urgent.

270
00:25:06,914 --> 00:25:09,913
- What man?
- The courier, sir. He's waiting outside.

271
00:25:10,114 --> 00:25:13,794
He said you would recognise
the secret password.

272
00:25:14,514 --> 00:25:17,914
- What secret password?
- Lady Fanny of Omaha!

273
00:25:25,194 --> 00:25:26,714
Hi!

274
00:25:27,513 --> 00:25:31,194
Could you take this to the guest bedroom
and see everything is pressed?

275
00:25:31,714 --> 00:25:33,594
Go ahead, Arthur.

276
00:25:34,594 --> 00:25:36,114
Wow!

277
00:25:36,194 --> 00:25:38,593
Wo-ha-ha-how! Wow!

278
00:25:38,794 --> 00:25:40,714
All I can say is "wow"!

279
00:25:41,394 --> 00:25:44,594
<i>What an asshole I was
telling you how to take women!</i>

280
00:25:44,794 --> 00:25:48,114
All right. How much do you want?

281
00:25:48,514 --> 00:25:50,794
Oh, Your Highness,
I don't want money from a man...

282
00:25:50,994 --> 00:25:54,193
...who needs every penny
to free his enslaved people.

283
00:25:58,394 --> 00:26:01,194
- What do you want?
- This!

284
00:26:01,314 --> 00:26:04,394
This! I want this!

285
00:26:07,194 --> 00:26:09,194
This is what I want.

286
00:26:09,313 --> 00:26:12,713
I don't want money. I want you
to teach me. I'm in your hands.

287
00:26:13,313 --> 00:26:15,594
- You can't be serious.
- Larry...

288
00:26:15,714 --> 00:26:17,114
Lawrence.

289
00:26:17,194 --> 00:26:22,194
All my life, I wanted to be the best at
something. I thought I was, till I met you.

290
00:26:22,313 --> 00:26:25,313
I never realised how far
you could go with this scamming thing.

291
00:26:25,513 --> 00:26:28,513
- You've opened my eyes!
- Freddy, this "scamming" thing...

292
00:26:28,594 --> 00:26:31,394
...as you put it, took me years to perfect.

293
00:26:32,994 --> 00:26:35,514
- I got time.
- Why should I help you?

294
00:26:36,914 --> 00:26:40,794
A guy with my mouth could ruin
a lot of business around here for you.

295
00:26:47,914 --> 00:26:50,314
What sort of an education did you have?

296
00:26:51,513 --> 00:26:53,514
High school diploma.

297
00:26:53,593 --> 00:26:55,994
And you majored in?

298
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:58,993
- Metal shop.
- Metal shop.

299
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:14,713
All right. I'll do it.

300
00:27:15,113 --> 00:27:16,513
Ha ha haa!

301
00:27:16,713 --> 00:27:20,194
- I'll teach you and pay you a percentage.
- Great!

302
00:27:20,314 --> 00:27:22,594
But with this one understanding.

303
00:27:22,793 --> 00:27:26,793
- I run this operation and you do as I say.
- Great!

304
00:27:28,713 --> 00:27:31,593
Classes begin after lunch.

305
00:27:36,913 --> 00:27:38,994
I have a plan for this Jackal.

306
00:27:39,113 --> 00:27:41,114
There is a man who owes me a favour.

307
00:27:41,193 --> 00:27:43,793
Réné the Knife.
He is a master with the stiletto...

308
00:27:43,994 --> 00:27:46,513
...and an absolute magician
at hiding a body.

309
00:27:46,713 --> 00:27:49,314
- Andre...
- As police inspector I give you my word...

310
00:27:49,394 --> 00:27:52,594
...the case will be investigated
in a very slipshod manner.

311
00:27:52,793 --> 00:27:56,113
- Stop worrying, Andre.
- I tell you, it is a mistake to take him in!

312
00:27:56,194 --> 00:28:00,594
I am taking him in gracefully
in order to get him out gracefully.

313
00:30:55,993 --> 00:30:59,394
- Well done!
- I look great, don't I? I know the moves!

314
00:30:59,593 --> 00:31:02,193
Yes, you're ready.
But remember our agreement.

315
00:31:02,313 --> 00:31:06,113
- I'm in charge. You do exactly as I say.
- Exactly as you say!

316
00:31:15,193 --> 00:31:17,193
I feel like a kept man.

317
00:31:18,593 --> 00:31:20,513
I'm sorry.

318
00:31:20,713 --> 00:31:23,193
I'm going to tell Andre
to tear up the cheque.

319
00:31:23,313 --> 00:31:27,593
Oh, no, you can't!
I paid the 100,000 francs in cash.

320
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:31,513
Damn.

321
00:31:31,993 --> 00:31:33,993
Please don't be mad at me.

322
00:31:34,113 --> 00:31:37,993
He said he wouldn't let you leave
unless I paid off your loan.

323
00:31:38,113 --> 00:31:40,393
What else did he say?

324
00:31:40,513 --> 00:31:44,993
He told me how you needed that money
for your country, to fight the communists.

325
00:31:45,113 --> 00:31:47,513
It's just such a noble cause.

326
00:31:47,713 --> 00:31:50,593
Oh, please don't be angry with me.

327
00:31:50,713 --> 00:31:54,593
Pretty please! Here comes a creep man...
He's out to get you!

328
00:31:54,793 --> 00:31:56,913
There's that smile!

329
00:31:58,194 --> 00:32:02,194
Daddy says we're gonna have
the biggest weddin' Tulsa's ever seen.

330
00:32:02,393 --> 00:32:04,313
When do you think we can fly back?

331
00:32:05,113 --> 00:32:07,193
Perhaps we should go by ship.

332
00:32:07,393 --> 00:32:08,793
Oh!

333
00:32:08,993 --> 00:32:10,913
Ruprecht loves the water.

334
00:32:11,312 --> 00:32:13,793
- R... Ruprecht?
- Yes, Ruprecht.

335
00:32:15,914 --> 00:32:17,913
Didn't I tell you about him?

336
00:32:18,114 --> 00:32:19,993
Ruprecht is my brother.

337
00:32:20,593 --> 00:32:23,513
- You have a brother?
- Yes, the young prince.

338
00:32:24,913 --> 00:32:28,313
You mean I'm goin' home
with two princes?

339
00:32:29,194 --> 00:32:31,793
Wherever I go, Ruprecht goes too.

340
00:32:33,513 --> 00:32:37,593
- When do I meet him?
- He's in his room, even as we speak.

341
00:32:37,713 --> 00:32:41,192
- Would you like to meet him right now?
- I would love to.

342
00:32:51,993 --> 00:32:55,992
- What's he doin' out here?
- His quarters are here.

343
00:33:07,313 --> 00:33:11,113
I think I should warn you
that Ruprecht is, well, uh...

344
00:33:11,193 --> 00:33:13,193
...special.

345
00:33:21,393 --> 00:33:23,313
Ruprecht, it is I, your brother.

346
00:33:24,393 --> 00:33:26,312
No sudden moves.

347
00:33:44,593 --> 00:33:47,794
You've been banging on your pots again,
haven't you?

348
00:33:51,993 --> 00:33:56,793
I told you, if you keep on doing it,
you won't have any pots left.

349
00:34:02,393 --> 00:34:04,313
All right.

350
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:08,112
Cuddly-cuddly.

351
00:34:09,113 --> 00:34:10,992
Oh, Ruprecht.

352
00:34:11,313 --> 00:34:14,312
Ruprecht, don't do that. Ruprecht, no!

353
00:34:15,512 --> 00:34:18,114
Stop it, Ruprecht! Ruprecht!

354
00:34:21,713 --> 00:34:23,993
He's very affectionate.

355
00:34:24,113 --> 00:34:26,993
Now, come along. Come along.

356
00:34:28,193 --> 00:34:31,794
Now, I want you to meet this nice lady.

357
00:34:32,593 --> 00:34:35,193
- Mother?
- No, this isn't your mother.

358
00:34:35,394 --> 00:34:39,193
- Not Mother?
- No. But I have wonderful news.

359
00:34:39,313 --> 00:34:41,913
Miss Trumble and I
are going to be married.

360
00:34:43,313 --> 00:34:45,393
And we are going to live in Oklahoma.

361
00:34:49,914 --> 00:34:51,913
Really?

362
00:34:54,113 --> 00:34:56,112
Oh dear.

363
00:35:01,312 --> 00:35:03,194
Ruprecht!

364
00:35:05,793 --> 00:35:07,793
Ruprecht!

365
00:35:09,393 --> 00:35:10,993
Ruprecht!

366
00:35:11,113 --> 00:35:14,912
We have a guest.
What do we do for guests?

367
00:35:15,192 --> 00:35:17,913
What did we do
when Uncle Ted was here?

368
00:35:25,513 --> 00:35:27,392
No, Ruprecht.

369
00:35:29,513 --> 00:35:31,593
Ruprecht, no!

370
00:35:31,912 --> 00:35:33,394
After that.

371
00:35:35,913 --> 00:35:38,193
We apologise.

372
00:35:55,713 --> 00:35:57,593
Ruprecht!

373
00:36:01,512 --> 00:36:04,113
Ruprecht! You want the genital cuff?

374
00:36:07,993 --> 00:36:11,112
Don't worry, Ruprecht.
We won't go anywhere without you.

375
00:36:13,192 --> 00:36:17,513
Oklahoma! Oklahoma!
Oklahoma! Oklahoma! Oklahoma!

376
00:36:18,192 --> 00:36:20,993
He'll enjoy Oklahoma's wide-open spaces.

377
00:36:21,114 --> 00:36:23,393
He loves to run and run and run.

378
00:36:38,913 --> 00:36:42,392
- Not Mother?
- No, Ruprecht. She's not our mother.

379
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:47,993
- Go on, Diana. You were saying.
- Well, I think that... Ow!

380
00:36:48,113 --> 00:36:49,193
Ruprecht!

381
00:36:49,392 --> 00:36:51,713
- May I take your trident, sir?
- Yes.

382
00:36:52,313 --> 00:36:56,313
Now, you were saying. You don't think
the poor should be allowed in museums?

383
00:36:56,512 --> 00:36:58,312
- I think...
- Ruprecht.

384
00:36:58,513 --> 00:37:00,792
Don't take the cork off the fork.

385
00:37:01,513 --> 00:37:03,313
Why is the cork on the fork?

386
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:06,112
To prevent him hurting
himself... and others.

387
00:37:06,513 --> 00:37:07,513
Ooh!

388
00:37:08,913 --> 00:37:12,393
Ruprecht, eat your apple sauce.

389
00:37:13,912 --> 00:37:17,912
Ruprecht, we have wonderful news.

390
00:37:19,113 --> 00:37:21,714
Diana and I are going to be married...

391
00:37:22,593 --> 00:37:24,913
...and we are all
going to live in Palm Beach.

392
00:37:26,513 --> 00:37:28,513
Ruprecht!

393
00:37:30,993 --> 00:37:33,793
- Eat your food.
- Excuse me.

394
00:37:33,992 --> 00:37:37,793
- May I go to the bathroom first?
- Of course you may.

395
00:37:50,913 --> 00:37:52,793
Thank you.

396
00:37:58,193 --> 00:38:00,113
Driving relaxes Ruprecht.

397
00:38:07,113 --> 00:38:10,793
Oh, Lawrence, this
is the happiest day of my life!

398
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:13,312
I think my testicles are dropping!

399
00:38:19,512 --> 00:38:21,712
It's been a very good month, chaps.

400
00:38:21,792 --> 00:38:24,513
Now, we've got 20 for the overhead.

401
00:38:24,713 --> 00:38:27,393
- For you, Arthur, it's 10.
- Thank you, sir.

402
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:28,392
Ow!

403
00:38:28,593 --> 00:38:31,913
- 15 for you, Andre.
- Nice work.

404
00:38:32,112 --> 00:38:34,113
And the rest is for me.

405
00:38:34,192 --> 00:38:36,792
<i>- Au revoir, Lawrence.
- Au revoir, Andre.</i>

406
00:38:42,393 --> 00:38:45,112
Excuse me!
What about me? What do I get?

407
00:38:46,313 --> 00:38:49,193
You are the student, Freddy.
You get knowledge.

408
00:38:49,392 --> 00:38:52,392
Wait. I did most of the work.
I should get my share of the cash.

409
00:38:52,512 --> 00:38:55,713
I wouldn't dream of giving you
your share without ensuring...

410
00:38:55,793 --> 00:38:59,112
...that you would spend it wisely
on beauty and culture.

411
00:38:59,193 --> 00:39:02,193
I've got culture coming out of my ass.

412
00:39:02,313 --> 00:39:05,113
Spending money is
a responsibility, Freddy.

413
00:39:05,913 --> 00:39:08,712
All right, all right. How am I
supposed to spend my money?

414
00:39:10,193 --> 00:39:12,993
Now, all these wines are very old.

415
00:39:13,113 --> 00:39:16,792
I purchased them to make certain
that they were cared for properly.

416
00:39:16,913 --> 00:39:21,112
- So you got a lot of wine to drink.
- You can't. They're far too valuable.

417
00:39:21,312 --> 00:39:23,312
- So you sell them?
- I'd never sell them.

418
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:25,392
They mean too much to me.

419
00:39:27,713 --> 00:39:32,192
In Europe, Freddy, gardens
take centuries to grow and cultivate.

420
00:39:32,312 --> 00:39:37,312
This one was about to die, until Mrs
Everson's brooch funded its preservation.

421
00:39:37,512 --> 00:39:40,312
- What's the angle?
- There is no angle, Freddy.

422
00:39:46,312 --> 00:39:50,592
I rescued this from certain destruction
and donated it to the museum.

423
00:39:51,313 --> 00:39:53,592
Just looking at it feeds my soul.

424
00:39:55,112 --> 00:39:57,792
- May I say something here?
- Of course.

425
00:39:57,913 --> 00:39:59,793
Are you kidding me or what?!

426
00:40:01,313 --> 00:40:05,392
I don't get it. You want me to spend
my money on wine you can't drink...

427
00:40:05,512 --> 00:40:08,592
...and a garden that, to me,
looks like a big mowing headache.

428
00:40:08,712 --> 00:40:12,592
It's true that is a sculpture of a naked
woman, and I can appreciate that.

429
00:40:12,713 --> 00:40:15,393
But otherwise, you have got to be joking.

430
00:40:15,793 --> 00:40:17,593
You agreed to do what I say.

431
00:40:17,712 --> 00:40:19,912
Not to you telling me
how to spend money...

432
00:40:19,993 --> 00:40:23,192
...and not to playing
Ruprecht the Monkey Boy all the time!

433
00:40:23,312 --> 00:40:25,192
I'm going it alone.

434
00:40:25,712 --> 00:40:26,792
Ugh!

435
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:30,712
Freddy. You still have so much to learn.

436
00:40:30,793 --> 00:40:33,793
No, thanks.
I was doing great with my own look.

437
00:40:33,992 --> 00:40:36,392
I don't need these clothes
or your instructions.

438
00:40:36,512 --> 00:40:40,192
You taught me what you know.
Great. Thanks. Thanks a yahoo.

439
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:42,192
I'm gettin' out of this town.

440
00:40:43,913 --> 00:40:45,912
Good luck.

441
00:41:02,792 --> 00:41:06,912
Well, the Jackal has finally tucked his tail
between his legs and crawled away.

442
00:41:07,112 --> 00:41:09,712
Good. Then it is business as usual, huh?

443
00:41:10,712 --> 00:41:13,312
<i>- Au revoir, Lawrence.
- Au revoir, Andre.</i>

444
00:41:13,912 --> 00:41:15,993
Oh, Miss! Miss!

445
00:41:17,513 --> 00:41:19,992
<i>Excuse me.
Where can I get the Wall Street Journal?</i>

446
00:41:20,192 --> 00:41:23,792
I'm trying to find out the stock prices
to see how my takeover bid is going.

447
00:41:23,992 --> 00:41:26,911
It's so hard to get
the stock prices around here.

448
00:41:28,112 --> 00:41:30,113
<i>Au revoir!</i>

449
00:41:31,793 --> 00:41:33,792
What are you doing here?

450
00:41:34,912 --> 00:41:37,193
You know, that's a funny story.

451
00:41:37,313 --> 00:41:40,192
I was at the train station, ticket in hand...

452
00:41:40,392 --> 00:41:43,791
...and I thought "What am I leaving
this place for? I love me here!"

453
00:41:43,912 --> 00:41:46,793
So, I'll be around a little bit more.
Lucky you.

454
00:41:46,913 --> 00:41:49,393
Freddy. Freddy!

455
00:41:50,313 --> 00:41:52,512
Freddy!

456
00:41:52,592 --> 00:41:56,992
There simply isn't enough room
for both of us to work Beaumont-sur-Mer.

457
00:41:57,112 --> 00:42:00,192
- You know what? I think you're scared.
- Of what?

458
00:42:00,312 --> 00:42:04,193
Competition. You've been top dog here
for so long, you think you own the place.

459
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:05,192
Nice!

460
00:42:05,312 --> 00:42:09,112
- Believe me, Freddy, I'm not afraid of you.
- Sure you are, and you should be.

461
00:42:09,192 --> 00:42:12,392
I'm younger than you.
I'm better-looking than you.

462
00:42:12,912 --> 00:42:17,993
I'm thinner than you. I could kick your
ass off this hill in a New York minute.

463
00:42:18,112 --> 00:42:20,712
And I could have you arrested again.

464
00:42:25,992 --> 00:42:28,592
And I could always call
Lady Fanny of Omaha.

465
00:42:34,712 --> 00:42:36,792
Freddy, as a younger man...

466
00:42:37,793 --> 00:42:41,112
...I was a sculptor,
a painter and a musician.

467
00:42:42,512 --> 00:42:44,391
There was just one problem.

468
00:42:44,992 --> 00:42:46,912
I wasn't very good.

469
00:42:47,113 --> 00:42:50,393
As a matter of fact, I was dreadful.

470
00:42:50,513 --> 00:42:56,392
I finally came to the frustrating conclusion
that I had taste and style, but not talent.

471
00:42:56,512 --> 00:42:58,511
I knew my limitations.

472
00:42:59,712 --> 00:43:02,192
We all have our limitations, Freddy.

473
00:43:02,312 --> 00:43:05,512
Fortunately,
discovered that taste and style...

474
00:43:05,593 --> 00:43:08,192
...were commodities that people desired.

475
00:43:08,312 --> 00:43:12,792
Freddy, what I'm saying is...
know your limitations.

476
00:43:12,992 --> 00:43:14,792
You are a moron.

477
00:43:14,992 --> 00:43:19,112
You've been trying to get me
out of this town ever since I came here.

478
00:43:19,193 --> 00:43:21,393
I'll tell you what. We'll make a bet.

479
00:43:21,513 --> 00:43:23,912
If I lose, I'll leave.

480
00:43:24,112 --> 00:43:26,992
If I win... you leave.

481
00:43:27,512 --> 00:43:30,512
All right, Freddy, suppose we try this.

482
00:43:31,591 --> 00:43:33,993
We find a woman, set a price...

483
00:43:34,113 --> 00:43:38,113
...and the first man to extract
the correct amount from her wins.

484
00:43:38,592 --> 00:43:40,592
But if you...

485
00:43:42,312 --> 00:43:46,312
But if you lose,
you not only leave town graciously...

486
00:43:46,511 --> 00:43:49,793
...you promise never to come back
to Beaumont-sur-Mer again.

487
00:43:49,913 --> 00:43:51,912
Done. Who's the woman?

488
00:44:09,912 --> 00:44:11,593
- Charles!
- Yes, monsieur?

489
00:44:11,712 --> 00:44:14,992
- Who is that?
- Miss Janet Colgate, monsieur.

490
00:44:15,112 --> 00:44:16,512
Who is she?

491
00:44:16,592 --> 00:44:19,992
I believe she is
the United States Soap Queen.

492
00:44:20,193 --> 00:44:21,713
Thank you, Charles.

493
00:44:26,992 --> 00:44:31,192
- OK, how much?
- She's a little young, isn't she?

494
00:44:31,392 --> 00:44:33,512
Out of your league?

495
00:44:42,592 --> 00:44:45,512
All right. I'll make it easy for you. $50,000.

496
00:44:45,592 --> 00:44:47,792
$50,000?!

497
00:44:48,592 --> 00:44:50,512
<i>Out of your league?</i>

498
00:44:52,313 --> 00:44:55,312
All right. I could use $50,000.

499
00:44:56,192 --> 00:44:58,512
First one to get 50,000 out of her.

500
00:44:58,592 --> 00:45:00,592
May the best man win.

501
00:45:01,512 --> 00:45:03,392
Thank you.

502
00:45:39,392 --> 00:45:41,512
She is at the roulette table...

503
00:45:41,712 --> 00:45:44,392
...just waiting for Your Highness.

504
00:45:44,912 --> 00:45:46,791
And Freddy?

505
00:45:46,911 --> 00:45:49,192
He has dropped from sight.

506
00:45:49,391 --> 00:45:53,392
Perhaps the Jackal finally realises
he is no match for the lion, huh?

507
00:45:53,593 --> 00:45:56,913
Keep your eyes open, Andre. He'll turn up.

508
00:46:11,512 --> 00:46:13,912
<i>Mesdames, Messieurs, faites vos jeux.</i>

509
00:46:23,192 --> 00:46:25,392
<i>Rien ne va plus. Terminé.</i>

510
00:46:40,712 --> 00:46:42,392
<i>Merci.</i>

511
00:46:47,391 --> 00:46:49,512
<i>Les jeux, messieurs.</i>

512
00:47:05,712 --> 00:47:07,711
<i>33!</i>

513
00:47:11,712 --> 00:47:13,792
<i>400 francs.</i>

514
00:47:14,112 --> 00:47:15,992
<i>Voila, monsieur, 200 francs.</i>

515
00:47:16,912 --> 00:47:20,191
Excuse me. Excuse me!

516
00:47:21,111 --> 00:47:23,511
Sorry, ma'am. Excuse me!

517
00:47:23,712 --> 00:47:25,791
Oh, I'm sorry.

518
00:47:28,513 --> 00:47:30,392
I'm sorry.

519
00:47:33,191 --> 00:47:35,192
Pardon me.

520
00:47:37,311 --> 00:47:39,312
Hi.

521
00:47:42,712 --> 00:47:44,592
Thank you.

522
00:47:45,592 --> 00:47:48,312
Sorry. Excuse me.

523
00:47:49,592 --> 00:47:51,591
Thank you.

524
00:47:59,712 --> 00:48:03,192
Pardon me, miss.
Would you mind placing the bet for me?

525
00:48:03,392 --> 00:48:06,391
It's terribly difficult
for me to reach the table.

526
00:48:06,511 --> 00:48:08,512
Sure. What number would you like?

527
00:48:10,511 --> 00:48:12,592
The way my luck's been running...

528
00:48:13,392 --> 00:48:15,312
Would you pick a number for me?

529
00:48:17,512 --> 00:48:19,391
I could use all the luck I can get.

530
00:48:34,192 --> 00:48:36,192
Oh.

531
00:48:44,312 --> 00:48:48,912
Miss? Would you ask the gentleman if he
could advance me a few dollars on this?

532
00:48:49,112 --> 00:48:51,192
I'm sorry, I cannot, monsieur.

533
00:48:51,312 --> 00:48:53,192
That's fine. Thank you.

534
00:49:10,392 --> 00:49:13,191
- Excuse me.
- Monsieur wins again.

535
00:49:19,392 --> 00:49:22,111
Listen, maybe I can help you.

536
00:49:22,791 --> 00:49:26,191
- It's just that that was my last chance.
- Your last chance for what?

537
00:49:26,311 --> 00:49:28,191
My last chance for an operation.

538
00:49:29,111 --> 00:49:32,112
Well, shouldn't the Navy
pay for your operation?

539
00:49:34,192 --> 00:49:37,392
It's not for me. It's for my grandmother.

540
00:49:38,511 --> 00:49:40,591
I just got word from the hospital...

541
00:49:40,711 --> 00:49:44,191
...that she's in pretty bad shape
and if they don't operate soon...

542
00:49:44,391 --> 00:49:46,592
...she might...

543
00:49:47,712 --> 00:49:52,391
I'm sorry. I don't even know you and here
I am bothering you with my problems.

544
00:49:52,511 --> 00:49:55,111
Oh, please don't feel that way.

545
00:49:55,912 --> 00:49:58,311
Why don't you just tell me what they are?

546
00:50:03,992 --> 00:50:06,791
Just one stroke of bad luck after another.

547
00:50:06,911 --> 00:50:09,111
Andre, come with me.

548
00:50:21,392 --> 00:50:23,592
10,000 francs.

549
00:50:23,712 --> 00:50:25,711
That's almost $2,000.

550
00:50:27,712 --> 00:50:29,591
I don't know how to thank you.

551
00:50:32,312 --> 00:50:34,592
But I want you to know...

552
00:50:34,712 --> 00:50:38,392
...that you have saved the life
of a wonderful person.

553
00:50:38,512 --> 00:50:41,391
You are a wonderful person. Thank you.

554
00:50:42,591 --> 00:50:44,592
You're welcome.

555
00:50:47,992 --> 00:50:51,512
Freddy... would an operation help you?

556
00:50:52,912 --> 00:50:55,911
No. My problem isn't physical.

557
00:50:56,112 --> 00:50:58,391
- It's emotional.
- Really?

558
00:50:59,311 --> 00:51:01,191
I'm on six weeks' MTL.

559
00:51:02,511 --> 00:51:04,512
Mental trauma leave.

560
00:51:05,191 --> 00:51:07,791
- What happened?
- Well...

561
00:51:07,992 --> 00:51:10,792
...I was engaged to a girl
back in the States.

562
00:51:12,191 --> 00:51:14,191
And we loved to dance.

563
00:51:14,911 --> 00:51:17,911
We wanted to be professionals.
Isn't that silly?

564
00:51:19,711 --> 00:51:23,512
<i>And we got an opportunity
to perform on TV, on Dance USA.</i>

565
00:51:24,511 --> 00:51:28,391
And we decided that if we won,
we'd get married.

566
00:51:29,311 --> 00:51:33,792
So, we went on and we danced,
and we won!

567
00:51:33,992 --> 00:51:36,191
Oh, great!

568
00:51:36,311 --> 00:51:40,792
And in the excitement... we got separated.

569
00:51:41,511 --> 00:51:43,391
So I went back to the studio...

570
00:51:45,391 --> 00:51:47,391
...and there they were...

571
00:51:48,510 --> 00:51:50,392
...naked...

572
00:51:50,591 --> 00:51:52,511
...dancing.

573
00:51:53,991 --> 00:51:56,191
And then they stopped...

574
00:51:56,391 --> 00:51:59,991
...and they made love,
right there on the dance floor.

575
00:52:01,711 --> 00:52:04,111
Who was she with?
