00:01:20,732 --> 00:01:24,319
Yuki! Hey, girl, time to eat.

2
00:01:24,611 --> 00:01:26,404
Oh, Yuki's my cat.

3
00:01:36,623 --> 00:01:38,625
Well, I don't understand.

4
00:01:38,792 --> 00:01:41,794
If you don't want to go out with him,
why did you say you would?

5
00:01:41,961 --> 00:01:45,048
I mean, you don't want to give him
the wrong idea, do you?

6
00:01:45,215 --> 00:01:47,217
Where is she?

7
00:01:48,551 --> 00:01:49,886
Yuki!

8
00:01:50,053 --> 00:01:54,098
Well, listen, you need
to make up your mind.

9
00:01:54,265 --> 00:01:56,309
Where is she?

10
00:01:57,518 --> 00:01:59,812
I'm starting to worry about my cat.

11
00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:02,565
She never misses a meal.

12
00:02:06,569 --> 00:02:07,987
Yuki?

13
00:02:09,697 --> 00:02:11,657
I'm gonna have to call you back.

14
00:02:15,828 --> 00:02:17,747
Yuki?

15
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:21,876
Yuki!

16
00:02:30,009 --> 00:02:33,638
We haven't seen her anywhere today,
but we'll be sure to tell you if we do.

17
00:02:33,804 --> 00:02:37,224
- Ice cream!
- She's wearing a bell like this one.

18
00:02:37,683 --> 00:02:41,854
- I don't know where your cat is.
- Me either.

19
00:02:42,021 --> 00:02:44,190
I know. She's at the old haunted house.

20
00:02:44,356 --> 00:02:47,777
Hey, look!
There's a rainbow over there again.

21
00:02:52,156 --> 00:02:55,910
I don't get it. She likes to stay home.
What is she doing over there?

22
00:02:56,076 --> 00:02:58,245
You know, you're not supposed
to go in there...

23
00:02:58,412 --> 00:03:01,665
...but we don't really care about that.
You wanna go?

24
00:03:01,832 --> 00:03:05,419
- Are we going?
- It's probably raining there again.

25
00:03:05,586 --> 00:03:07,379
Let's go!

26
00:03:10,591 --> 00:03:12,176
Nice moves, man.

27
00:03:12,343 --> 00:03:14,094
Come on!

28
00:03:19,683 --> 00:03:24,396
- Hey, it's over here.
- Wait, I'm coming with you.

29
00:03:24,563 --> 00:03:26,732
You sure it's okay to show her?

30
00:03:27,065 --> 00:03:29,234
Hello? Where are you?

31
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,945
Guys? Where'd you go?

32
00:03:32,112 --> 00:03:33,947
Where'd they go?

33
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:37,367
- Come on, boy.
- Whoa, cool truck!

34
00:03:37,534 --> 00:03:38,994
Settle down!

35
00:03:39,203 --> 00:03:41,079
Hold still!

36
00:03:41,246 --> 00:03:43,749
Sit! Sit!

37
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:33,298
Hello?

38
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:36,468
Where is everyone?

39
00:05:03,661 --> 00:05:05,330
Yuki?

40
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,415
Yuki?

41
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:11,044
Stupid cat.

42
00:05:33,524 --> 00:05:35,901
What's happening?
What's going on here?

43
00:05:38,321 --> 00:05:41,073
- I got it!
- Yeah!

44
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,994
Yuki? Is that you?

45
00:05:47,288 --> 00:05:50,082
There you are, Yuki.

46
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:52,960
Come here.

47
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:57,214
I've been looking everywhere for you.
Bad cat.

48
00:05:58,048 --> 00:06:00,176
Bet you're hungry, huh?

49
00:06:18,986 --> 00:06:23,157
I figured this out yesterday.
Your cat's okay.

50
00:06:23,323 --> 00:06:25,492
Yeah, thanks.

51
00:06:27,244 --> 00:06:29,079
It's those boys.

52
00:06:29,621 --> 00:06:32,499
- Ready!
- There he goes.

53
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:35,461
<i>Banzai! Yes!</i>

54
00:06:41,508 --> 00:06:44,344
May I have your attention, please.

55
00:06:44,511 --> 00:06:47,556
And you are the winner!

56
00:06:50,142 --> 00:06:54,396
No fair. He hit the ground.
His nose is bleeding. Look!

57
00:06:54,813 --> 00:06:57,899
I think he's right.
He hit the ground.

58
00:07:02,988 --> 00:07:05,657
- Hey, who told her?
- Don't look at me.

59
00:07:05,824 --> 00:07:08,452
- I don't know.
- I didn't tell her.

60
00:07:09,161 --> 00:07:11,997
So this house is haunted.

61
00:07:47,323 --> 00:07:54,080
- No way. Wow, this is too much!
- This never happened before.

62
00:08:02,463 --> 00:08:06,509
That, that was...
What was that?

63
00:08:13,933 --> 00:08:15,351
Hi.

64
00:08:19,063 --> 00:08:20,481
Anybody home?

65
00:08:23,651 --> 00:08:25,820
Yeah, they're gonna tear it down.

66
00:08:30,575 --> 00:08:33,411
Come on, come on, come on!

67
00:08:34,954 --> 00:08:37,415
Hey, light as a feather.

68
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:45,923
- I wanna try! I wanna try!
- Come on, we could help her.

69
00:09:06,443 --> 00:09:09,071
Hey, hey! Come on.
Get away from there. Move along!

70
00:09:12,449 --> 00:09:13,826
Yuki, wait!

71
00:09:14,034 --> 00:09:18,581
<i>Clear the area.
Clear the area immediately.</i>

72
00:09:18,789 --> 00:09:20,582
Get out of here!

73
00:09:26,714 --> 00:09:27,923
Yuki!

74
00:09:29,133 --> 00:09:31,260
Where are you?

75
00:09:33,053 --> 00:09:34,263
Yuki!

76
00:09:37,099 --> 00:09:38,767
Yuki!

77
00:09:45,232 --> 00:09:47,276
Yuki.

78
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:56,368
<i>If you don 't want to go out with him,
why did you say you would?</i>

79
00:09:56,535 --> 00:09:59,538
<i>I mean, you don 't wanna give him
the wrong idea.</i>

80
00:09:59,705 --> 00:10:01,707
<i>Where is she?</i>

81
00:10:02,457 --> 00:10:04,918
<i>Yuki!</i>

82
00:10:06,086 --> 00:10:08,630
<i>You need to make up your mind.</i>

83
00:10:08,797 --> 00:10:10,632
<i>Where is she?</i>

84
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:13,635
<i>I'm starting to worry.
Yuki!</i>

85
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,975
Hey, you! We've got one over here.

86
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:24,437
You don't belong here.

87
00:10:24,604 --> 00:10:26,356
<i>Move along, folks.</i>

88
00:10:26,523 --> 00:10:29,401
<i>Nothing to see here.
Come on, folks, out of the way.</i>

89
00:10:29,609 --> 00:10:31,236
<i>Go about your business.</i>

90
00:10:34,239 --> 00:10:35,824
Let go of me, let go!

91
00:10:35,991 --> 00:10:40,370
- Tell me you have all of them.
- Yes, sir. The last one's over there.

92
00:10:42,664 --> 00:10:46,000
- Examine her. Then let her go.
- Yes, sir.

93
00:10:46,167 --> 00:10:52,048
Let go! Listen to me! There's no bugs
in there! It's just some kids!

94
00:10:52,215 --> 00:10:54,175
Let go!

95
00:10:56,219 --> 00:10:59,848
- Listen!
- Seal the area off now.

96
00:11:45,059 --> 00:11:48,062
I'm going, I'll see you guys later.

97
00:11:48,229 --> 00:11:51,273
- Nothing.
- Yeah, nothing.

98
00:11:52,066 --> 00:11:53,693
Work!

99
00:11:53,859 --> 00:11:55,611
It's not working.

100
00:11:55,778 --> 00:11:59,115
Forget it. Come on, let's go.

101
00:13:22,614 --> 00:13:26,451
<i>A case to end all cases.</i>

102
00:13:38,713 --> 00:13:41,549
<i>You know what I mean, Dinah?</i>

103
00:13:42,175 --> 00:13:45,011
<i>I used to think being
a private detective was cool.</i>

104
00:13:45,178 --> 00:13:48,515
<i>Like Sam Spade
or Phillip Marlowe, right?</i>

105
00:13:48,682 --> 00:13:51,726
<i>But there's nothing cool left to it.</i>

106
00:13:52,894 --> 00:13:58,233
<i>On top of that, both my fridge
and my bank account are empty.</i>

107
00:14:08,243 --> 00:14:09,285
Wait.

108
00:14:09,452 --> 00:14:11,371
Okay, Dinah, let's bet.

109
00:14:11,537 --> 00:14:16,542
If it's another suspicious husband,
I'm out of this business forever.

110
00:14:17,669 --> 00:14:21,464
<i>- Hello?
- Mr. Ash, I have a job for you.</i>

111
00:14:21,631 --> 00:14:25,218
And you need me
to check on your wife, right?

112
00:14:25,385 --> 00:14:27,553
<i>I'm looking for a computer hacker.</i>

113
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,057
<i>This hacker goes by the alias Trinity.
That's all we know.</i>

114
00:14:31,224 --> 00:14:34,102
Well, it looks like we're still
in business, Dinah.

115
00:14:34,268 --> 00:14:36,562
Fine. And who will I be working for?

116
00:14:36,729 --> 00:14:39,106
<i>- I can 't say.
- You can't say.</i>

117
00:14:39,273 --> 00:14:42,401
Call me back when you can say.
That's not the way I do business.

118
00:14:42,568 --> 00:14:44,320
It was a pleasure chatting with you.

119
00:14:44,487 --> 00:14:49,659
<i>Before you hang up, take a look
at your bank account balance.</i>

120
00:14:56,332 --> 00:14:59,627
<i>I didn't get a good feeling
about the case.</i>

121
00:15:00,086 --> 00:15:03,964
<i>But I had no good reason
to turn the guy down now.</i>

122
00:15:04,548 --> 00:15:06,967
<i>This Trinity was well-known
in hacker circles.</i>

123
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:09,970
<i>A real artist by the sound of it.</i>

124
00:15:10,137 --> 00:15:13,516
<i>The cops were always
one step behind him.</i>

125
00:15:14,099 --> 00:15:17,853
<i>So I knew I could get that close.
Question was, could I get closer?</i>

126
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:21,857
<i>I had a few tricks up my sleeve
for getting to hackers.</i>

127
00:15:23,234 --> 00:15:28,530
<i>While I was searching,
I found something strange.</i>

128
00:15:31,367 --> 00:15:33,994
<i>Other detectives had been
on the case too.</i>

129
00:15:34,161 --> 00:15:39,500
<i>And their investigations had all been,
shall we say, troubled.</i>

130
00:15:39,667 --> 00:15:41,502
<i>One of the guys killed himself.</i>

131
00:15:42,002 --> 00:15:44,004
<i>Another had disappeared.</i>

132
00:15:45,005 --> 00:15:47,174
<i>Another went crazy.</i>

133
00:15:47,591 --> 00:15:51,637
<i>So I paid the one
who was left a visit.</i>

134
00:15:52,137 --> 00:15:54,223
<i>The crazy one.</i>

135
00:15:57,726 --> 00:16:02,397
Trinity doesn't exist, man.
He's not real.

136
00:16:02,564 --> 00:16:07,569
He's a figment. A cipher.
A jabberwocky.

137
00:16:08,904 --> 00:16:13,200
And who am I? Who the hell am I?

138
00:16:20,582 --> 00:16:22,876
<i>Did I mention he was crazy?</i>

139
00:16:27,172 --> 00:16:31,218
<i>Chessboards, jabberwocky,
Red Queen...</i>

140
00:16:31,384 --> 00:16:33,887
<i>I started searching
all the usual hacker hangouts...</i>

141
00:16:34,054 --> 00:16:36,848
<i>... for someone with
an Alice in Wonderland m.o.</i>

142
00:16:37,015 --> 00:16:40,477
<i>Hacker bulletin boards,
anonymous mailboxes, chat rooms.</i>

143
00:16:40,644 --> 00:16:44,689
<i>And it was in one of those
that I picked up Trinity's trail.</i>

144
00:17:51,923 --> 00:17:53,633
<i>"Six brooks."</i>

145
00:17:54,008 --> 00:17:57,678
<i>"I'll be there at 2005."</i>

146
00:18:04,518 --> 00:18:05,811
Of course!

147
00:18:05,978 --> 00:18:08,898
Crossing the second brook
takes her into the woods.

148
00:18:09,065 --> 00:18:11,859
Alice jumps the first brook...

149
00:18:12,026 --> 00:18:13,819
...and...

150
00:18:15,946 --> 00:18:19,074
And then she boards a train.

151
00:18:25,331 --> 00:18:26,999
Thanks.

152
00:18:33,422 --> 00:18:34,673
Excuse me.

153
00:18:36,508 --> 00:18:37,760
Hey!

154
00:18:38,218 --> 00:18:39,887
Hey!

155
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:07,080
I knew this was some kind of trap.

156
00:19:07,247 --> 00:19:12,044
There's a difference, Mr. Ash,
between a trap and a test.

157
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:14,421
You were testing me?

158
00:19:14,588 --> 00:19:17,633
You made it. I'm impressed.

159
00:19:18,216 --> 00:19:21,053
Flattery will get you everywhere.

160
00:19:21,219 --> 00:19:24,056
I'm not here to flatter you,
I'm here to save you.

161
00:19:40,405 --> 00:19:42,240
What just happened?

162
00:19:42,407 --> 00:19:45,410
Mr. Ash, dream of having
an eye exam lately?

163
00:19:48,204 --> 00:19:50,874
Yeah, how'd you know?

164
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:54,878
You've stepped
to the edge of the looking glass.

165
00:19:56,671 --> 00:19:59,924
So then, that means I wasn't dreaming.

166
00:20:03,553 --> 00:20:07,807
They hired me as a way
of getting to you, didn't they?

167
00:20:12,437 --> 00:20:14,230
Go!

168
00:20:34,917 --> 00:20:38,921
What the hell is going on here?
This is really crazy.

169
00:20:39,088 --> 00:20:41,966
Now I understand what happened
to those other detectives.

170
00:20:42,133 --> 00:20:43,968
They went nuts.

171
00:20:46,846 --> 00:20:50,475
Well, I've gotten out
of worse jams than this.

172
00:20:50,641 --> 00:20:53,519
I am not gonna let them get you.

173
00:20:58,232 --> 00:21:00,359
What's happening to me?

174
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:07,658
I'm sorry.

175
00:21:07,825 --> 00:21:10,619
You didn't make it, Mr. Ash.

176
00:21:19,295 --> 00:21:21,005
I wish...

177
00:21:21,172 --> 00:21:23,466
...I could go with you.

178
00:21:24,717 --> 00:21:26,719
I don't blame you, you know.

179
00:21:26,886 --> 00:21:30,055
Everything that happened, Trinity,
it was all my fault.

180
00:21:32,975 --> 00:21:37,062
<i>All that Through the Looking Glass stuff.</i>

181
00:21:38,522 --> 00:21:41,817
Can't get my head around it.
I'm old-fashioned.

182
00:21:45,487 --> 00:21:49,199
There's a difference between
a test and a choice.

183
00:21:51,326 --> 00:21:54,705
For what it's worth,
I think you could've handled the truth.

184
00:21:58,375 --> 00:22:00,544
It was just a job.

185
00:22:00,711 --> 00:22:03,005
Goodbye, Trinity.

186
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:05,382
Goodbye.

187
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:47,632
<i>A case to end all cases.</i>

188
00:23:37,473 --> 00:23:41,686
Wake up. Baby's spotted
two machines heading in fast.

189
00:23:44,147 --> 00:23:45,231
I see them.

190
00:23:46,107 --> 00:23:48,484
<i>They're runners.
Think you can handle them?</i>

191
00:23:48,651 --> 00:23:49,986
Watch me.

192
00:24:40,661 --> 00:24:41,996
Okay. I'm in.

193
00:27:21,237 --> 00:27:23,906
That runner's smarter
than we've seen so far.

194
00:27:24,073 --> 00:27:25,825
- It's quite a catch.
- Thanks.

195
00:27:25,991 --> 00:27:27,827
Will it..?
Do you think it'll convert?

196
00:27:27,993 --> 00:27:30,663
To convert is its choice to make.

197
00:27:32,248 --> 00:27:34,417
Do you think maybe
we ought to reprogram it?

198
00:27:34,583 --> 00:27:36,252
No. We can't make slaves of them.

199
00:27:36,418 --> 00:27:38,129
Because that would be simpler.

200
00:27:38,295 --> 00:27:40,798
We won't beat the machines
by making them our slaves.

201
00:27:40,965 --> 00:27:42,842
Better to let them join us by choice.

202
00:27:43,008 --> 00:27:45,928
Make them believe the right choice
is the one we want them to make.

203
00:27:46,095 --> 00:27:49,682
All right. Yes, machines are tools.
They're made to be used.

204
00:27:49,848 --> 00:27:51,767
- It's their nature.
- To be slaves.

205
00:27:51,934 --> 00:27:54,937
That's why we can show them
a better world, why they convert.

206
00:27:55,104 --> 00:27:58,065
- But that world we show them isn't real.
- It doesn't matter.

207
00:27:58,232 --> 00:28:01,610
I'm afraid they'll figure out that
we've made up the thing in our heads.

208
00:28:01,819 --> 00:28:05,614
They can't tell the difference.
To an artificial mind, all reality is virtual.

209
00:28:05,823 --> 00:28:09,410
How do they know that the real world
isn't just another simulation?

210
00:28:09,576 --> 00:28:10,619
How do you?

211
00:28:10,786 --> 00:28:14,623
I know I'm not dreaming now because
I know what it's like being in a dream.

212
00:28:14,832 --> 00:28:17,292
So dreaming lets you know
reality exists.

213
00:28:17,501 --> 00:28:21,296
No. Just that my mind exists.
I don't know about the rest.

214
00:28:36,853 --> 00:28:40,232
Okay, he's good to go.
Looks like we are too.

215
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:42,192
Dreaming already?

216
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:44,611
He's had a rough day.

217
00:28:44,778 --> 00:28:46,238
You poor baby.

218
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:50,242
Would you mind?

219
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:52,160
Not at all.

220
00:29:53,096 --> 00:29:54,555
Hello there.

221
00:35:51,868 --> 00:35:53,661
What's happening?

222
00:35:55,288 --> 00:35:56,331
Sentinels.

223
00:36:10,219 --> 00:36:11,721
Let's go!

224
00:36:59,476 --> 00:37:01,353
Come on, damn it, help me!

225
00:39:12,108 --> 00:39:13,151
