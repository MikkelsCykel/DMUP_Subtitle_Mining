1
00:02:00,236 --> 00:02:02,329
- I think your tape...
- Oh, Jesus!

2
00:02:02,438 --> 00:02:03,803
...got eaten.

3
00:02:03,907 --> 00:02:05,841
Jesus! That was good!

4
00:02:05,942 --> 00:02:09,742
- Yeah. They're great, Creedence.
- This thing's brand new!

5
00:02:10,413 --> 00:02:12,574
- How about the radio?
- Radio doesn't work.

6
00:02:12,649 --> 00:02:14,981
You can't get anything out here.
No entertainment.

7
00:02:15,084 --> 00:02:17,848
Now there's no entertainment. Damn it!

8
00:02:17,954 --> 00:02:21,913
Well, I guess we just have to talk
to each other, huh?

9
00:02:21,991 --> 00:02:24,459
We talked to each other already.

10
00:02:25,094 --> 00:02:26,186
Yeah, I know where you're from.

11
00:02:26,296 --> 00:02:29,265
Hey, hey, hey,
want to see something real scary?

12
00:02:29,332 --> 00:02:31,027
- Sure.
- I love this. Okay?

13
00:02:31,134 --> 00:02:32,601
- Yeah, what?
- We're driving along here, right?

14
00:02:32,669 --> 00:02:35,695
- Yeah.
- Imagine... Not running out of gas,

15
00:02:35,805 --> 00:02:37,705
- we have plenty of gas. All right?
- Yeah.

16
00:02:37,807 --> 00:02:40,799
Oh, my God!
What are those gravel beds up ahead?

17
00:02:40,877 --> 00:02:42,640
They're gonna fly up
and knock out our lights.

18
00:02:44,447 --> 00:02:46,381
- Hey, come on.
- Blackness. Oh, my goodness.

19
00:02:46,482 --> 00:02:49,508
Why, there could be nuns ahead,
we wouldn't even see them.

20
00:02:49,619 --> 00:02:50,984
- Isn't this amazing? Look!
- Yeah, yeah.

21
00:02:51,054 --> 00:02:52,487
I don't know whether it's too safe.

22
00:02:52,555 --> 00:02:54,955
I used to play chicken
and see how far we could drive

23
00:02:55,024 --> 00:02:57,549
without someone, either the passenger
or the driver, going, "Stop. "

24
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,786
- Well, I don't know.
- Oh, my God, huh?

25
00:02:58,862 --> 00:03:00,523
- I think you better just...
- Who's chicken, huh?

26
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:03,531
...turn the lights on now.
- Is that a bear up there?

27
00:03:04,968 --> 00:03:06,128
Uh-oh, more pebbles.

28
00:03:06,202 --> 00:03:09,535
Oh, my goodness. It looks like
they're out permanently this time.

29
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:11,800
- This is dangerous.
- No. The road's straight,

30
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:13,843
it's just kind of scary, a little.
What is that up ahead?

31
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,138
Something might come up ahead.

32
00:03:15,211 --> 00:03:17,805
- Yeah, right.
- A big, huge squirrel!

33
00:03:17,981 --> 00:03:19,744
Chicks love that.

34
00:03:19,849 --> 00:03:22,716
- That's scary enough.
- I know. I like it.

35
00:03:24,053 --> 00:03:25,918
- Hey, you like trivia?
- Yeah.

36
00:03:26,022 --> 00:03:28,422
Okay. Want to play TV theme songs?

37
00:03:28,524 --> 00:03:30,253
- Sure.
- You know how to play that?

38
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,725
- No.
- I'll hum a theme song.

39
00:03:31,828 --> 00:03:35,730
If you guess it, you get to hum one.
If I guess it, I get to have it back.

40
00:03:35,832 --> 00:03:38,096
- Okay.
- Lf you get three in a row, you win.

41
00:03:38,201 --> 00:03:40,761
- Okay. I'm good at that.
- Okay. Okay, I'll start.

42
00:03:46,843 --> 00:03:48,276

Yes.

67

What is it?

68
00:05:01,351 --> 00:05:05,583
I don't know, but you're doing it great.
Sounds like it was on CBS.

69
00:05:12,161 --> 00:05:13,423
- You know what...

One more hint.

72
00:05:19,502 --> 00:05:22,130
- What was its locale? Locale?
- Surfboards.

73

<i>- "An island in the Pacific Ocean. "

75
00:05:27,477 --> 00:05:29,604
Jesus, I thought I was good at this.

76
00:05:31,848 --> 00:05:34,282
<i>Did you ever watch The Twilight Zone?</i>

77
00:05:38,888 --> 00:05:41,982
<i>Oh, God, remember The Twilight Zone
with Burgess Meredith?</i>

78
00:05:42,058 --> 00:05:44,049
Remember, he loved to read,

79
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,628
and there was a nuclear war,
and he had no friends anyway,

80
00:05:46,696 --> 00:05:47,856
and he was down
in the basement of the library.

81
00:05:47,964 --> 00:05:49,124
- Oh, yeah, with the glasses!
- Yes.

82
00:05:49,198 --> 00:05:51,189
He was the last man
and he broke his glasses.

83
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,324
- Yeah.
- This thing freaked me out.

84
00:05:52,402 --> 00:05:54,734
When I was seven years old,
I bought another pair of glasses

85
00:05:54,837 --> 00:05:56,202
just in case that would happen.

86
00:05:56,305 --> 00:05:58,796
Those shows, they were so good,
they were so scary.

87
00:05:58,875 --> 00:05:59,967
- Yeah.
- They were great.

88
00:06:00,043 --> 00:06:02,204
Remember the one
where the guy had the stopwatch?

89
00:06:02,311 --> 00:06:03,801
Somebody in a bar gave him a stopwatch,

90
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,370
and he was this real obnoxious guy.

91
00:06:05,481 --> 00:06:09,008
And he took the stopwatch, and he hit it,
and everybody else in time froze but him.

92
00:06:09,085 --> 00:06:11,417
<i>- That's an Outer Limits.
- No, that was a Zone.</i>

93
00:06:11,521 --> 00:06:13,887
<i>- That's an Outer Limits.
- That was a Zone.</i>

94
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:15,150
Well, they had one about the mannequins

95
00:06:15,224 --> 00:06:16,555
that got two weeks off
and turned into humans

96
00:06:16,659 --> 00:06:18,889
and they were allowed to go out
and shop for two weeks on their own.

97
00:06:18,995 --> 00:06:20,519
And then this one came back
and it was over two weeks,

98
00:06:20,596 --> 00:06:22,359
and the other mannequins went
"Come over here for a minute"

99
00:06:22,432 --> 00:06:25,196
- and turned her into plastic.
- Boy, they were scary. They were great.

100
00:06:25,268 --> 00:06:26,496
I loved it.

101
00:06:26,569 --> 00:06:29,902
Hey, you want to see something
really scary?

102
00:06:30,006 --> 00:06:31,530
You bet!

103
00:06:31,607 --> 00:06:33,165
- Really?
- Yeah.

104
00:06:33,843 --> 00:06:36,573
Okay, this is really, really scary now.

105
00:06:36,913 --> 00:06:39,780
- I trust you.
- Okay, pull the car over.

106
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:43,682
- Pull the car over?
- You want to see it?

107
00:06:43,753 --> 00:06:46,449
- Well, show me while I'm driving.
- No, I can't. I can't tell you about it.

108
00:06:46,556 --> 00:06:47,614
It should only take a couple of seconds.

109
00:06:47,723 --> 00:06:48,883
All right. Two seconds. Okay?

110
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:50,050
- Okay.
- What is it?

111
00:06:50,126 --> 00:06:51,184
- Just pull it over.
- Okay.

112
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,352
- I'll show you.
- All right.

113
00:07:01,471 --> 00:07:02,631
Okay.

114
00:07:04,407 --> 00:07:05,772
Scare me.

115
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:08,275
- Are you ready?
- Okay, go ahead.

116
00:07:14,283 --> 00:07:16,080
What are you doing?

117
00:07:31,901 --> 00:07:35,428
<i>You unlock this door

<i>This is a sour man, a lonely man,

- All right.

133
00:08:53,516 --> 00:08:58,010
I can't stay long. My wife's relatives

Hey, girl, another beer over here!

135
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:03,559
Bill, you look kind of cranky this evening.

136
00:09:03,659 --> 00:09:05,752
Yeah, I'm pissed, all right.

137
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:08,925
Know that guy Goldman?

138
00:09:09,031 --> 00:09:11,056
You didn't get promoted?

139
00:09:12,935 --> 00:09:15,403
They gave it to that Jew bastard.

140
00:09:19,242 --> 00:09:21,870
Why don't you come over here
and cheer me up? I need it.

141
00:09:21,944 --> 00:09:23,741
Just drink your beer.

142
00:09:26,048 --> 00:09:28,414
What about you? You want to cheer me up?

143
00:09:28,517 --> 00:09:30,246
Don't touch me.

144
00:09:30,853 --> 00:09:32,912
"Don't touch me. " Okay.

145
00:09:33,522 --> 00:09:35,114
I think she likes you, Bill.

146
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,129

- Bill, drink your beer. Relax.

147
00:09:42,231 --> 00:09:44,222
What do you mean, "relax"?

148
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,632
They give Goldman my promotion
and you're telling me to relax.

149
00:09:46,736 --> 00:09:48,863
You know
what that would've meant to me?

150
00:09:48,938 --> 00:09:51,702
An extra $6,000 a year that I'd earn.

151

You know that, don't you?

153
00:09:57,413 --> 00:09:59,210
How long has Goldman been there?

154
00:09:59,282 --> 00:10:02,740
So what if he's been there longer than me?
So what? I'm better than him!

155
00:10:02,818 --> 00:10:04,649
I worked hard for that promotion,
and what happens?

156
00:10:04,754 --> 00:10:06,244
They give it to some Jew.

157
00:10:06,322 --> 00:10:08,654
I mean, what else do the hell they want,
for Christ's sake?

158
00:10:08,758 --> 00:10:10,055
They own everything as it is.

159
00:10:10,126 --> 00:10:13,118
Come on, Bill,
the Jews don't own everything.

160
00:10:13,229 --> 00:10:14,924
The Arabs won't let them.

161
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,233
Arabs. What the hell is that?
Just a nigger wrapped up in a sheet.

162
00:10:22,505 --> 00:10:25,440
- He's on a roll now.
- I'll tell you something.

163
00:10:25,508 --> 00:10:26,736
I don't know what's the matter
with this country,

164
00:10:26,809 --> 00:10:28,902
but it's getting tougher and tougher
to earn a living.

165
00:10:28,978 --> 00:10:31,845
You know why? I'll tell you why.

166
00:10:31,947 --> 00:10:35,849
Because of the Jews, because of
the blacks, because of the Orientals.

167
00:10:35,951 --> 00:10:38,249
- You're ranting, Bill.
- Yeah, I'm ranting. Why not?

168
00:10:38,321 --> 00:10:40,482
You know who owns my house? Jap bank!

169
00:10:40,589 --> 00:10:43,490
I tell you something else, niggers live
not more than six blocks from my house!

170
00:10:43,592 --> 00:10:45,025
Six blocks.

171
00:10:46,429 --> 00:10:49,694
Excuse me, mister.
Have you got a problem?

172
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:53,165
Yeah, I got a lot of problems.

173
00:10:53,269 --> 00:10:57,365
Look, I really don't care
what you gentlemen think

174
00:10:57,473 --> 00:10:59,839
as long as we don't have to listen to it.

175
00:10:59,942 --> 00:11:01,603
It's okay. No problem.

176
00:11:01,677 --> 00:11:05,306
My friend's just a little upset,
that's all. He got some bad news today.

177
00:11:09,352 --> 00:11:10,376
Yeah...

178
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:17,319
You trying to get us killed?

179
00:11:17,393 --> 00:11:20,556
I just finished telling you
that some Jew got my job,

180
00:11:20,663 --> 00:11:22,688
niggers live in my neighborhood!
You getting embarrassed?

181
00:11:22,832 --> 00:11:25,494
You want to leave?
You want me to hold it down? What?

182
00:11:26,168 --> 00:11:28,033
- Bill, just take it easy.
- Hey, don't give me that!

183
00:11:28,137 --> 00:11:30,503
I'm gonna tell you something.
I love this country, damn it.

184
00:11:30,573 --> 00:11:35,135
And I fought for it in Korea.
And my country paid me to kill gooks.

185
00:11:35,211 --> 00:11:36,644
Hey! Hey!

186
00:11:36,712 --> 00:11:39,476
But those same gooks now own my house.

187
00:11:42,885 --> 00:11:44,648
I needed that job.

188
00:11:45,321 --> 00:11:47,516
I really needed that promotion.

189
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:49,558
I was counting on the extra money.

190
00:11:50,659 --> 00:11:51,990
I don't understand. The Jews are rich.

191
00:11:52,061 --> 00:11:54,427
What the hell do they want
with my job, anyway?

192
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:58,489
Hey, Bill, I know Goldman.
You can't exactly call him rich.

193
00:11:59,101 --> 00:12:01,365
You don't understand
what the hell I'm talking about, do you?

194
00:12:01,437 --> 00:12:06,033
I'm trying to tell you
that I'm better than a Jew.

195
00:12:06,108 --> 00:12:07,939
I'm better than some
African spear-chucker,

196
00:12:08,043 --> 00:12:11,501
I'm better than some gook,
because I'm an American!

197
00:12:12,014 --> 00:12:13,845
I'm an American!
Doesn't that mean anything anymore?

198
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:16,908
- Hold it down.
- No, you hold it down!

199
00:12:17,019 --> 00:12:19,010
How about, "Please, hold it down?"

200
00:12:19,088 --> 00:12:21,283
How about, "Please, hold this?"

201
00:12:23,192 --> 00:12:25,217
Hey, Bill, wait a minute.

202
00:12:26,195 --> 00:12:27,457
Bill.

203
00:12:27,563 --> 00:12:30,396
Hey, I'm real sorry about your boy, man.

204
00:13:31,627 --> 00:13:32,821
What?

205
00:13:39,869 --> 00:13:40,927
Hey.

206
00:13:42,004 --> 00:13:44,939
Hey, that's my wallet. Hold it.
That's my wallet!

207
00:13:53,782 --> 00:13:57,183
That's a... That's a credit card,
for Christ's sake.

208
00:14:00,689 --> 00:14:04,648
Look, that's my license, that's my wallet,
that's my credit card.

209
00:14:09,298 --> 00:14:11,027
Hey, guys, give me a break.

210
00:14:16,038 --> 00:14:19,667
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute!

211
00:16:25,434 --> 00:16:29,131
Lady, help me, please.

212
00:16:35,177 --> 00:16:36,940
I've been shot.

213
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,670
I don't know where I am, lady.
I need some...

214
00:16:39,782 --> 00:16:43,650
Can you help me, lady? Look, this...
I've been shot. I...

215
00:16:47,322 --> 00:16:48,949
I don't know what's happening to me.

216
00:16:55,564 --> 00:16:56,724
Please, lady.

217
00:17:02,738 --> 00:17:04,535
They were the ones who shot me.

218
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:37,289
No, no, no.

219
00:18:40,002 --> 00:18:41,264
No, no.

220
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:57,150
We got you now, nigger.

221
00:19:12,301 --> 00:19:14,667
This nigger's got a gold watch.

222
00:19:16,171 --> 00:19:18,605
You stole this, didn't you, boy?

223
00:19:18,841 --> 00:19:20,274
Where am I?

224
00:19:22,511 --> 00:19:24,672
Look, I didn't do anything wrong.
What are you doing to me?

225
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:27,044
Hang the coon son of a bitch!

226
00:19:27,816 --> 00:19:31,343
Are you crazy? You're insane.
You're all crazy!

227
00:19:34,223 --> 00:19:35,952
Burn that nigger!

228
00:19:36,024 --> 00:19:37,616
I'm not a nigger.
- Okay, look out.

229
00:19:37,693 --> 00:19:39,684
I didn't do anything wrong.

230
00:19:39,795 --> 00:19:41,228
I didn't do anything wrong.
What are you doing to me?

231
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:42,388
Shut up, nigger!

232
00:19:42,497 --> 00:19:44,658
I'm a white man! What the hell's
the matter with you? I'm white!

233
00:19:59,548 --> 00:20:01,641
The nigger's getting away!

234
00:22:54,923 --> 00:22:56,550
Charlie's out there, man. I know it.

235
00:22:56,658 --> 00:22:59,684
Be cool, man.
Don't get your nuts in a bunch.

236
00:23:00,262 --> 00:23:02,822
He's right, man. Something's moving.

237
00:23:02,898 --> 00:23:05,662
Hey, I don't want no VC up my ass, man.

238
00:23:12,007 --> 00:23:13,702
- Hey.
- Shut up!

239
00:23:19,181 --> 00:23:23,345
Help. I'm an American!
I'm an American. Help me!

240
00:23:45,974 --> 00:23:48,704
I told you guys, we shouldn't have
shot Lieutenant Niedermayer!

241
00:24:36,925 --> 00:24:40,656
Take it easy, will you? Will you?
They shot me in the leg.

242
00:24:41,163 --> 00:24:44,132
Take it easy there, will you?
Where are you taking me?

243
00:24:46,468 --> 00:24:49,596
Look, I want to speak
to a commanding officer!

244
00:24:49,671 --> 00:24:52,765
I demand to speak
to your commanding officer, you hear me?

245
00:24:52,974 --> 00:24:56,808
I demand to speak
to the commanding officer!

246
00:25:13,828 --> 00:25:19,733
No, no, no, no!

247
00:25:55,704 --> 00:25:56,728
Ray.

248
00:25:58,039 --> 00:26:02,840
Ray! Ray! Larry!

249
00:26:02,911 --> 00:26:07,541
It's me! Larry! Larry, help!

250
00:26:07,616 --> 00:26:12,610
Ray, it's me! Hey, Larry! Ray, it's me!

251
00:26:12,721 --> 00:26:16,020
Ray, help! Larry! Ray!

252
00:26:16,091 --> 00:26:20,892
It's me! It's me! It's me! It's me!

253
00:26:21,396 --> 00:26:25,730
Help! Help! It's me!

254
00:26:41,583 --> 00:26:45,883
<i>It is sometimes said that
where there is no hope, there is no life.</i>

255
00:26:46,721 --> 00:26:50,817
<i>Case in point, the residents
of Sunnyvale Rest Home,</i>

256
00:26:50,925 --> 00:26:52,825
<i>where hope is just a memory.</i>

257
00:26:54,095 --> 00:26:57,064
<i>But hope just checked into Sunnyvale,</i>

258
00:26:57,132 --> 00:27:03,867
<i>disguised as an elderly optimist who
carries his magic in a shiny tin can.</i>

259
00:27:04,239 --> 00:27:08,801
Vitamin A is for the scalp, the hair,
vision, and teeth.

260
00:27:09,244 --> 00:27:14,113
Vitamin B is for the hair
and mucous membrane.

261
00:27:14,949 --> 00:27:18,282
Vitamin C is for the circulatory system.

262
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,351
Very important for that part.

263
00:27:21,022 --> 00:27:25,482
And let's not forget calcium
for good strong bones and teeth.

264
00:27:25,593 --> 00:27:27,288
Before we get to that, though,

265
00:27:27,362 --> 00:27:30,763
I always recommend a little lemon juice
in the diet.

266
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:36,093
Good diet, healthy senior citizen.

267
00:27:36,171 --> 00:27:38,799
Now to E. This is an important one.

268
00:27:38,873 --> 00:27:42,172
If you've enjoyed healthy sex
throughout your life,

269
00:27:42,277 --> 00:27:48,182
there's no reason why you can't continue
to enjoy, well into your 80s.

270
00:27:48,283 --> 00:27:51,218
Now, I have some special exercises for you.

271
00:27:51,319 --> 00:27:55,449
That's Leo Conroy. That's his kid.
He's in real estate.

272
00:27:55,523 --> 00:27:58,321
Well, first,
lean down over your lap.

273
00:27:58,393 --> 00:28:02,386
That's right. Arms hanging loosely.

274
00:28:02,497 --> 00:28:05,398
Good. Now, roll your spine up.

275
00:28:12,474 --> 00:28:16,035
You said maybe this week
I could come visit.

276
00:28:16,144 --> 00:28:17,304
Come visit.

277
00:28:17,379 --> 00:28:21,748
I wish you could, Pop,
but it's bad timing this week.

278
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:26,219
- We really have to be going now.
- I understand.

279
00:28:26,588 --> 00:28:28,556
Maybe next week, Pop.

280
00:28:34,829 --> 00:28:38,424
We're gonna be late for the game.
Jeff has to...

281
00:28:45,874 --> 00:28:47,364
Bye-bye, Pop.

282
00:28:51,012 --> 00:28:52,604
So long.

283
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:12,696
Every second Saturday, he carries
those cases down to his kid's car,

284
00:29:13,435 --> 00:29:18,134
and every second Saturday he carries
them back upstairs again and unpacks.

285
00:29:24,913 --> 00:29:25,937
<i>The answer is:</i>

286
00:29:30,385 --> 00:29:32,649
Don't say it, Agee. I'm thinking.

287
00:29:32,754 --> 00:29:34,119
What is the Yellow River?

288
00:29:35,457 --> 00:29:36,583
Those damn kids!

289
00:29:36,658 --> 00:29:40,458
They've been told not to play around here.
Old people need their rest.

290
00:29:40,562 --> 00:29:44,396
Well, they're just playing, Mr. Conroy.
No harm done.

291
00:29:44,466 --> 00:29:47,458
I wish I could go out there
and play with them.

292
00:29:47,569 --> 00:29:53,098
- Why don't you, Mrs. Dempsey?
- Because, Mr. Bloom,

293
00:29:55,143 --> 00:29:56,735
she is old.

294
00:29:57,645 --> 00:30:01,103
You're never too old to play, Mr. Conroy.

295
00:30:01,816 --> 00:30:04,842
You see, when I rest, I rust.

296
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,948
Is this your first time
in an old age home, Bloom?

297
00:30:08,022 --> 00:30:11,583
No, actually, Mr. Conroy,
I've been in six or eight of them.

298
00:30:13,261 --> 00:30:18,028
Tell me, Mrs. Dempsey, if you could go out
there and play with those children tonight,

299
00:30:18,132 --> 00:30:19,929
what would you want to play?

300
00:30:20,001 --> 00:30:23,835
Well, I used to love all kinds of games,
especially jacks.

301
00:30:23,938 --> 00:30:26,873
I used to be
elementary school jacks champion.

302
00:30:30,979 --> 00:30:32,606
Don't say it, Agee! I'm thinking.

303
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:37,174
But if I could tell my body now
what to do, I would dance.

304
00:30:40,655 --> 00:30:42,213
Who is Bartholomew Cubbins?

305
00:30:42,323 --> 00:30:45,815
<i>- Who is Bartholomew Cubbins?
- Good for you. Bartholomew Cubbins!</i>

306
00:30:47,128 --> 00:30:50,154
I would be honored if you would dance
with me, Mrs. Dempsey.

307
00:30:50,231 --> 00:30:53,064
I would love... Oh, my back!

308
00:30:55,136 --> 00:30:57,161
Paul, this is Amadeus.

309
00:30:57,238 --> 00:30:59,229
Remember how to use him?

310
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:02,207
What I wouldn't give
just to be hitting puberty again.

311
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:03,334
Oh, go on.

312
00:31:03,411 --> 00:31:05,845
Remember this, Mrs. Dempsey?

313
00:31:05,914 --> 00:31:09,077
"Not last night, but the night before

314
00:31:09,183 --> 00:31:13,085
"24 robbers came knocking at my door

315
00:31:13,187 --> 00:31:17,817
"As I ran out, they ran in

316
00:31:17,892 --> 00:31:22,989
- "And this is what they said to me... "
- Stop!

317
00:31:24,098 --> 00:31:27,192
You had a full life, sweetheart.
Don't go sloppy on me now.

318
00:31:27,268 --> 00:31:29,236
And put on the shoes, huh?

319
00:31:29,337 --> 00:31:32,272
A good Jew only goes barefoot
when someone has died.

320
00:31:32,373 --> 00:31:34,000
I'm not that kind of Jew.

321
00:31:34,075 --> 00:31:35,565
Well, I am. Put them on.

322
00:31:35,677 --> 00:31:39,340
Mr. Weinstein,
what were you like as a boy?

323
00:31:39,414 --> 00:31:43,350
Oh, I loved to climb anything.
Like a cat, I could climb.

324
00:31:43,418 --> 00:31:46,945
- I always wanted to be Douglas Fairbanks.
- Oh, you still do, Mr. Agee.

325
00:31:47,055 --> 00:31:51,048
I broke more bedsprings and bones
by jumping from my dresser to the bed

326
00:31:51,125 --> 00:31:52,717
and out the window.

327
00:31:52,794 --> 00:31:55,092
Me, I like being old.

328
00:31:55,196 --> 00:31:57,790
My son has promised to have me frozen.

329
00:31:57,899 --> 00:32:00,629
You're already frozen, popsiclehead.

330
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:04,470
What about you, Mr. Bloom?

331
00:32:04,572 --> 00:32:08,804
- What did you play?
- My game was kick the can.

332
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:13,210
Oh, that was a boys' game.
My late husband, Jack Dempsey...

333
00:32:13,281 --> 00:32:16,739
- Not the fighter?
- Oh, not the fighter, not the fighter.

334
00:32:16,818 --> 00:32:21,084
Jack Dempsey was the most gentle man
who ever walked on the earth.

335
00:32:21,155 --> 00:32:24,716
Jack Dempsey loved that game.
He absolutely loved...

336
00:32:24,792 --> 00:32:29,286
What is the point of all this talk?
Why are you dredging all this up?

337
00:32:29,397 --> 00:32:30,489
It isn't healthy!

338
00:32:30,598 --> 00:32:34,796
"Birdie with the yellow bill,
hopped upon my window sill

339
00:32:34,902 --> 00:32:39,805
"Cocked his shiny eye and said,
'Ain't you shamed, you sleepyhead?"'

340
00:32:39,907 --> 00:32:43,934
Marbles! Now there was a game.

341
00:32:44,012 --> 00:32:47,641
Life was so simple and gentle
when I was a little girl.

342
00:32:48,249 --> 00:32:53,084
- People took care of me.
- They take care of you here.

343
00:32:53,621 --> 00:32:57,785
Miss Cox takes great care of you.
Doesn't let you do a thing.

344
00:32:58,993 --> 00:33:03,020
No. But I had lots of friends and toys.

345
00:33:03,264 --> 00:33:05,198
- Toys? You want toys?
- Toys.

346
00:33:05,299 --> 00:33:09,133
Why, they have toys here
to last you the rest of your life.

347
00:33:09,203 --> 00:33:11,501
- And friends?
- Oh, yes, friends.

348
00:33:11,606 --> 00:33:14,700
Why, Mr. Bloom here
is trying to make friends.

349
00:33:14,976 --> 00:33:18,104
Trying to stir them all up,
aren't you, Bloom?

350
00:33:18,713 --> 00:33:23,946
The day we stop playing
is the day we start getting old,

351
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:27,485
start watching the clock,

352
00:33:28,322 --> 00:33:33,555
waiting for the days to hurry up and end,
counting the years.

353
00:33:33,828 --> 00:33:37,025
We always have something
to look forward to.

354
00:33:37,131 --> 00:33:41,227
Another dawn, another day,
another summer,

355
00:33:41,335 --> 00:33:45,066
another game of kick the can!

356
00:33:48,309 --> 00:33:49,742
Kick the can!

357
00:33:57,351 --> 00:33:59,683
- So who's playing?
- What?

358
00:33:59,754 --> 00:34:02,723
I'm starting up a game of kick the can!
Who's playing?

359
00:34:02,824 --> 00:34:06,590
Bloom, when was the last time
you fell down

360
00:34:06,694 --> 00:34:08,992
and couldn't get up by yourself?

361
00:34:09,063 --> 00:34:10,690
How dare you ask them to go out there

362
00:34:10,765 --> 00:34:13,097
and risk the little bit of life
they have left in them?

363
00:34:13,201 --> 00:34:15,692
Life is risk, Mr. Conroy.

364
00:34:16,404 --> 00:34:21,774
I'm not asking anybody to do anything
that I'm not willing to do.

365
00:34:21,876 --> 00:34:23,503
Well, I agree with that.

366
00:34:23,578 --> 00:34:27,173
Maybe if we played kick the can,

367
00:34:28,082 --> 00:34:32,746
we'd get a little hold of that magic
we all been missing.

368
00:34:33,621 --> 00:34:35,418
A little hold on youth.

369
00:34:35,523 --> 00:34:38,356
Look, their bones are old and will break
if they try to run.

370
00:34:38,426 --> 00:34:40,394
Their hearts are old. Their lungs are old!

371
00:34:40,461 --> 00:34:44,420
Miss Cox would never allow us
to go out there and play, Mr. Bloom.

372
00:34:44,532 --> 00:34:48,525
- It's against the rules.
- Rules?

373
00:34:48,603 --> 00:34:51,595
- Did rules ever stop a child?
- No.

374
00:34:51,706 --> 00:34:55,608
You gonna let rules stop you
from the chance of being young again?

375
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:58,201
Oh, no, no, no. I don't think so.

376
00:34:59,714 --> 00:35:04,083
You see, this old man still has
a little magic left in him.

377
00:35:05,553 --> 00:35:12,550
And if you believe, I can promise to
make you all feel like children again.

378
00:35:12,627 --> 00:35:15,960
You're making promises they can't keep!

379
00:35:16,063 --> 00:35:20,227
- Mrs. Dempsey, I want to see you dance.
- Oh, I would love that.

380
00:35:20,301 --> 00:35:23,464
And I want to see you climb, Mr. Weinstein.

381
00:35:23,571 --> 00:35:25,903
<i>Like a ketsele I'll climb!</i>

382
00:35:25,973 --> 00:35:28,100
We'll break the rules.

383
00:35:28,176 --> 00:35:32,408
What can they take away from us
we haven't already lost?

384
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,675
When were you thinking of playing,
Mr. Bloom?

385
00:35:34,782 --> 00:35:39,082
Tonight, tonight, tonight!

386
00:35:39,854 --> 00:35:42,015
Don't bother to wake me up!

387
00:36:13,888 --> 00:36:15,355
It's time.

388
00:36:16,824 --> 00:36:18,382
It's time.

389
00:36:21,062 --> 00:36:24,031
It smells like midnight, as I recall.

390
00:36:47,989 --> 00:36:53,017
One, two, three, four, five, six,

391
00:36:53,094 --> 00:36:57,155
seven, eight, nine, ten.

392
00:37:04,906 --> 00:37:06,703
I see you, Agee!

393
00:37:06,774 --> 00:37:09,766
Tallyho! Tallyho!

394
00:37:14,015 --> 00:37:15,573
Mr. Bloom is...

395
00:37:16,183 --> 00:37:17,775
Oh, see, Mr. Bloom?

396
00:37:17,885 --> 00:37:19,750
Paul kicked the can.

397
00:37:19,854 --> 00:37:22,550
Mr. Bloom is "it" again.

398
00:37:26,794 --> 00:37:29,126
Ollie ollie oxen free!

399
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:32,529
- Ollie ollie oxen free!
- Ollie ollie oxen free!

400
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:35,797

Ollie ollie oxen free!

Ollie ollie oxen free!

402
00:37:39,373 --> 00:37:41,034
Damn kids.

Ollie ollie oxen free! Ollie ollie oxen free!

404
00:37:43,277 --> 00:37:45,745
Ollie ollie oxen...

00:37:45,813 --> 00:37:47,804
Oh, my God!

406
00:37:51,953 --> 00:37:55,787
- Gladys?
- Is that you, Harry?

407
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:58,154
<i>Such a little mieskeyt.</i>

408
00:37:59,493 --> 00:38:01,120
Look how short I am!

409
00:38:01,228 --> 00:38:03,753
Play. Play. You wanted to play? Go play!

410
00:38:03,831 --> 00:38:06,459
Beware the thrust of my steel!

411
00:38:13,174 --> 00:38:15,938
Beware of the Black Pirate!

412
00:38:23,484 --> 00:38:29,582

414
00:38:37,498 --> 00:38:40,092
I'll be the boy, and I'll catch you!

415
00:38:40,167 --> 00:38:44,536
- No, Mr. Agee, you stay away!
- Not now!

416
00:38:44,638 --> 00:38:45,662
No, Mr. Agee!

417
00:38:45,773 --> 00:38:48,970
I like your scent. It's
like everlasting youth.

418
00:38:49,677 --> 00:38:52,339
Agee, get away from my wife!

419
00:39:02,056 --> 00:39:05,355

422
00:39:11,999 --> 00:39:13,899
May I have your dance?

423
00:39:35,723 --> 00:39:41,184
Sir, I don't wish to appear ungrateful,
but why didn't you come, too?

424
00:39:41,896 --> 00:39:46,993
I found out a long, long time ago

425
00:39:47,068 --> 00:39:53,337
I wanted to be my own true age
and try and keep a young mind.

426
00:39:54,542 --> 00:39:58,672
Your wish has come true.
You're children again.

427
00:39:59,447 --> 00:40:04,180
- You got your whole life before you.
- But my life was hard.

428
00:40:04,885 --> 00:40:07,046
I had a swell life.

429
00:40:07,121 --> 00:40:10,056
I could do 60 years standing on my head.

430
00:40:10,891 --> 00:40:14,850
I'm cold.
Where are we going to spend the night?

431
00:40:14,929 --> 00:40:19,798
- Who's going to take care of us?
- No problem for us.

432
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:25,805
We'll just knock on our son's door and say,
"Let us in, Murray. We're your parents. "

433
00:40:26,373 --> 00:40:28,364
Now, wait a minute.

434
00:40:28,442 --> 00:40:32,879
Let's think this over. I mean,
we're talking about being young again.

435
00:40:33,447 --> 00:40:35,438
We're talking about sex.

436
00:40:36,784 --> 00:40:41,118
But Jack Dempsey isn't here!
I'll never meet him!

437
00:40:42,723 --> 00:40:46,750
My ring! My wedding ring! It fell off!

438
00:40:47,728 --> 00:40:51,425
Oh, please, I didn't ask to be young again.

439
00:40:51,499 --> 00:40:53,967
All I wanted to do was dance.

440
00:40:54,935 --> 00:40:57,335
I can be old and dance.

441
00:40:58,606 --> 00:41:01,268
I'm not going to school again.

442
00:41:02,143 --> 00:41:06,079
I remember the night when my father died.

443
00:41:06,147 --> 00:41:10,516
We laid him out
and sent all the children outside.

444
00:41:10,618 --> 00:41:14,076
I saw Halley's Comet fly over.

445
00:41:14,155 --> 00:41:17,921
I don't want to lose
all the people that I loved again.

446
00:41:19,026 --> 00:41:22,086
I was too young to see Halley's Comet.

447
00:41:22,163 --> 00:41:25,826
I was going to see it
when I was 80 years old.

448
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:30,593
That's only two birthdays away,
Mrs. Dempsey.

449
00:41:30,938 --> 00:41:35,307
Would you like to see it at eight or 80?

450
00:41:38,012 --> 00:41:39,377
Eighty.

451
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:51,121
Thank you.

452
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:57,028
Well, you can always go inside
and go back to bed.

453
00:41:58,632 --> 00:42:03,831
Maybe if you old folks had
a little of that magic still left in you,

454
00:42:04,638 --> 00:42:09,041
you could wake up back
in your old, nice bodies,

455
00:42:10,344 --> 00:42:15,680
but with fresh young minds.

456
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:19,045
Fresh young minds.

457
00:42:19,753 --> 00:42:21,345
Young minds.

458
00:42:22,323 --> 00:42:26,487
- Fresh young minds.
- Fresh young minds.

459
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,686
Yeah.

460
00:42:34,702 --> 00:42:39,332
- Harry, wait!
- Wait a minute, wait a minute!

461
00:42:39,406 --> 00:42:41,340
I like being young.

462
00:43:00,194 --> 00:43:01,752
Popsiclehead!

463
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:08,068
There are kids in the beds.

464
00:43:08,969 --> 00:43:11,267
There are kids in the beds!

465
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:16,041
- There are kids...
- Kids, kids, kids.

466
00:43:17,811 --> 00:43:19,142
Kids.

467
00:43:20,648 --> 00:43:23,048
Yeah. Yeah.

468
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:26,278
- What are you talking about?
- You'll see. There were kids in the beds.

469
00:43:26,387 --> 00:43:27,945
The bed...

470
00:43:33,627 --> 00:43:35,219
Well, they have...

471
00:43:36,930 --> 00:43:39,125
There were kids in the beds.

472
00:43:39,767 --> 00:43:44,227
Good evening, Miss Cox.
- Well, they're old now.

473
00:43:46,607 --> 00:43:48,336
Tallyho!

474
00:43:51,245 --> 00:43:56,808
Welcome to Sherwood, milady.
What, Sir Guy? No greetings from you?

475
00:43:56,917 --> 00:43:59,408
Why are you doing in here,
you little ragamuffin?

476
00:43:59,486 --> 00:44:04,253
How dare you come in here at this hour
of the night and frighten these people.

477
00:44:15,769 --> 00:44:19,671
Please, take me with you.

478
00:44:21,175 --> 00:44:23,143
I want to go, too.

479
00:44:24,378 --> 00:44:26,710
You can't come with me, Leo.

480
00:44:31,352 --> 00:44:34,150
You'll have to stay with yourself.

481
00:44:34,221 --> 00:44:39,181
"There's a destiny that shapes our ends,
roughhewn though it may be. "

482
00:44:40,794 --> 00:44:42,352
I'm sorry.

483
00:44:43,964 --> 00:44:47,161
Well, let's away!

484
00:44:47,568 --> 00:44:51,004
But I'm ready now.

485
00:44:53,073 --> 00:44:54,700
I'm ready.

486
00:44:54,808 --> 00:44:57,572
It's wonderful to be young again!

487
00:44:57,678 --> 00:45:01,512
Beware the thrust of my steel. Tallyho!

488
00:45:58,071 --> 00:45:59,766
He'll get it.

489
00:46:04,044 --> 00:46:05,909
Tomatoes are on the fence.

490
00:46:07,581 --> 00:46:11,540
We've been saying for years
that we'd go and see that lake.

491
00:46:11,618 --> 00:46:13,279
Let's ask Murray to come along.

492
00:46:13,387 --> 00:46:16,151
Let's ask Mr. Conroy,
he could bring his grandchild.

493
00:46:16,256 --> 00:46:22,058
Mr. Agee! Mr. Agee!
Has anyone seen Mr. Agee?

494
00:46:22,296 --> 00:46:23,729
Hannah?

495
00:46:33,607 --> 00:46:37,509
<i>Why are you sitting around moping,
sitting around hoping</i>

496
00:46:37,611 --> 00:46:39,306
<i>Just listen to me</i>

497
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:44,983
<i>I'm sure that you will agree
Age means nothing</i>

498
00:47:06,206 --> 00:47:08,936
- Mr. Bloom?
- In person.

499
00:47:09,009 --> 00:47:12,308
Oh, how wonderful!
We were expecting you.

500
00:47:12,379 --> 00:47:17,043
Excuse me, ladies and gentleman,
our new guest has arrived.

501
00:47:33,467 --> 00:47:38,336
<i>Portrait of a woman in transit.
Helen Foley, age 27.</i>

502
00:47:38,405 --> 00:47:40,873
<i>Occupation, schoolteacher.</i>

503
00:47:40,974 --> 00:47:45,741
<i>Up until now, the pattern of her life
has been one of unrelenting sameness,</i>

504
00:47:45,846 --> 00:47:48,872
<i>waiting for something different to happen.</i>

505
00:47:49,316 --> 00:47:54,845
<i>Helen Foley doesn't know it yet,
but her waiting has just ended.</i>

506
00:47:55,689 --> 00:47:59,318
Okay, I give up. Where am I?

507
00:47:59,393 --> 00:48:00,758
Well, you're not lost.

508
00:48:00,861 --> 00:48:04,820
It looks like you missed a turnoff
at Cliffordville right there.

509
00:48:04,898 --> 00:48:09,358
Yeah, okay, half mile down the road's
a gas station, that's Beaumont.

510
00:48:09,436 --> 00:48:10,698
You hang a left and you go four blocks.

511
00:48:10,771 --> 00:48:12,671
The highway cuts right in front of it.
You can't miss it.

512
00:48:12,739 --> 00:48:14,536
You probably...

513
00:48:17,244 --> 00:48:20,839
Hey, kid, easy on the machinery.

514
00:48:20,914 --> 00:48:22,438
It doesn't work right.

515
00:48:22,549 --> 00:48:25,109
Kid, I don't build the games,
I just keep the quarters.

516
00:48:25,218 --> 00:48:27,618
Why don't you stick another quarter in,
maybe it'll work better.

517
00:48:28,689 --> 00:48:31,954
See, the highway splits
right outside of town, it goes off...

518
00:48:34,061 --> 00:48:35,961
Walter, the kid is screwing up the TV.

519
00:48:36,063 --> 00:48:38,054
Hey, it's his quarter.
The TV's free, you know.

520
00:48:38,131 --> 00:48:39,689
Yeah? I got 20 bucks on this.

521
00:48:39,766 --> 00:48:41,290
Lots of luck.

522
00:48:43,470 --> 00:48:46,200
So, where you headed?

523
00:48:48,742 --> 00:48:50,903
- Willoughby.
- Hey, nice town.

524
00:48:50,978 --> 00:48:54,709
- You got a job set up there or what?
- No, not really.

525
00:48:54,781 --> 00:48:56,942
- Where you from?
- Homewood.

526
00:48:58,218 --> 00:48:59,276
Nice town.

527
00:48:59,386 --> 00:49:01,911
- Lf you say so.
Hello. Yeah.

528
00:49:01,989 --> 00:49:04,389
Hey, Walter, it's your wife.

529
00:49:06,293 --> 00:49:09,387
- Your wife.
- Thanks.

530
00:49:14,668 --> 00:49:17,159
<i>...cannot hurt him. There's a left-hand...</i>

531
00:49:20,073 --> 00:49:21,563
- Okay.
- Hey, Charlie.

532
00:49:21,642 --> 00:49:24,941
Hey, come on, man, take it easy.
Take it easy.

533
00:49:26,747 --> 00:49:27,975
That's it.

534
00:49:28,682 --> 00:49:30,274
That's enough!

535
00:49:31,752 --> 00:49:33,481
What's going on here?

536
00:49:34,755 --> 00:49:36,518
Hey, what happened?

537
00:49:40,794 --> 00:49:42,762
Hey, look, I don't know
what happened, lady.

538
00:49:42,829 --> 00:49:44,626
Whatever happened, I'm sorry.

539
00:49:44,698 --> 00:49:47,189
Yes, well...

540
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:50,861
Hey, forget about the sandwich. No charge.

541
00:49:50,971 --> 00:49:51,995
Terrific.

542
00:49:53,974 --> 00:49:57,102
- Nice town.
- That was real good.

543
00:49:57,177 --> 00:49:58,940
Thanks a lot, guys.

544
00:50:18,999 --> 00:50:20,864
Oh, my God.

545
00:50:20,967 --> 00:50:22,161
Are you all right?

546
00:50:22,235 --> 00:50:23,293
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

547
00:50:23,403 --> 00:50:26,463
Are you sure? Here. Let me see.

548
00:50:27,474 --> 00:50:29,339
Oh, shit. God.

549
00:50:30,644 --> 00:50:35,081
Oh, no! Look at that!
Look, I'll give you some money.

550
00:50:35,182 --> 00:50:37,514
- Can you get it fixed?
- Yeah.

551
00:50:38,919 --> 00:50:41,683
- Could you maybe give me a ride home?
- Sure.

552
00:50:47,324 --> 00:50:49,622
You live all the way out here?

553
00:50:52,162 --> 00:50:54,460
I'll bet your parents are worried about you.

554
00:50:54,531 --> 00:50:56,624
- Not really.
- No?

555
00:50:57,734 --> 00:51:01,170
Today's my birthday.
They don't even care about that.

556
00:51:03,573 --> 00:51:05,006
Really?

557
00:51:06,176 --> 00:51:07,200
Wow.

558
00:51:07,310 --> 00:51:10,575
- What a crummy birthday.
- It's okay.

559
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:12,307
I made a friend.

560
00:51:14,050 --> 00:51:15,517
Me, too.

561
00:51:16,686 --> 00:51:18,085
I'm Anthony.

562
00:51:20,323 --> 00:51:23,349
- Helen Foley.
- I'm very glad to meet you, Helen.

563
00:51:23,426 --> 00:51:24,893
Thank you.

564
00:51:56,359 --> 00:51:57,951
What a lovely house.

565
00:51:58,061 --> 00:51:59,289
- You like it?
- Yeah.

566
00:51:59,396 --> 00:52:01,762
It's really peaceful out here by itself.

567
00:52:02,532 --> 00:52:03,897
Come on in.

568
00:52:34,931 --> 00:52:37,661
Hello? It's me!

569
00:52:37,767 --> 00:52:39,928
- Hi, Anthony!
- Hi!

570
00:52:40,003 --> 00:52:42,062
- Well, well, well.
- Hello.

571
00:52:42,138 --> 00:52:45,835
- Anthony's home!
- Look at this. How do you do?

572
00:52:45,942 --> 00:52:48,570
- This is Helen.
- Is that right? Helen?

573
00:52:48,645 --> 00:52:51,011
Helen, delighted to meet you.
Any friend of Anthony's is a friend...

574
00:52:51,114 --> 00:52:52,308
Hello.

575
00:52:52,415 --> 00:52:55,111
This is Uncle Walt and my sister, Ethel.

576
00:52:55,185 --> 00:52:56,277
How do you do?

577
00:52:56,353 --> 00:52:59,686
Well, now, did I hear Anthony come in?

578
00:52:59,789 --> 00:53:02,986
- Yes, there he is!
- This is my mother and father.

579
00:53:03,093 --> 00:53:04,151
- Hello.
- Hello.

580
00:53:04,261 --> 00:53:06,627
- This is Helen.
- Helen Foley.

581
00:53:06,696 --> 00:53:07,822
Helen. Delighted.

582
00:53:07,931 --> 00:53:10,764
- It's a pleasure to meet you, Helen.
- She gave me a ride home.

583
00:53:10,834 --> 00:53:12,768
- Did she?
- You don't mean it!

584
00:53:12,836 --> 00:53:14,269
Very generous of you.

585
00:53:14,337 --> 00:53:17,135
Yes, well, I'm afraid
we had a little accident.

586
00:53:18,208 --> 00:53:19,470
Accident?

587
00:53:19,542 --> 00:53:22,636
Yes, well, I knocked Anthony down
while he was riding his bicycle.

588
00:53:22,712 --> 00:53:26,671
- Did you?
- You knocked him down?

589
00:53:27,317 --> 00:53:28,477
Yes.

590
00:53:32,022 --> 00:53:34,547
Well, doesn't look like
there was any harm done.

591
00:53:34,658 --> 00:53:38,685
No, sir. No, sir. Anthony's fine.
- Oh, yes. Yes, Anthony's fine!

592
00:53:38,795 --> 00:53:41,161
- Can Helen stay for supper, Mother?
- Oh, no, really, I was just...

593
00:53:41,231 --> 00:53:42,721
- What a wonderful idea!
Good idea.

594
00:53:42,832 --> 00:53:45,027
Of course she can!

595
00:53:47,837 --> 00:53:49,702
Well, that would be lovely.

596
00:53:49,806 --> 00:53:52,138
Can we eat right now?
- Oh, yes.

597
00:53:52,208 --> 00:53:53,470
Sure! Why not!

598
00:53:53,543 --> 00:53:56,205
Why not?
We can eat anytime we want.

599
00:53:56,313 --> 00:53:58,474
- May I wash my hands?
- Right this way.

600
00:53:58,548 --> 00:54:01,016
- You may leave this.
- All right.

601
00:54:01,084 --> 00:54:04,815
- And I'll help you with your sweater.
- Thank you.

602
00:54:06,189 --> 00:54:08,350
See you in a little while.

603
00:54:18,268 --> 00:54:19,735
Mind the step.

604
00:54:53,570 --> 00:54:54,935
Anthony.

605
00:55:07,083 --> 00:55:08,380
Anthony?

606
00:55:12,822 --> 00:55:14,119
Anthony?

607
00:55:15,959 --> 00:55:17,551
Ah, the beach.

608
00:55:19,729 --> 00:55:22,892
Oh, I used to love the beach.

609
00:55:24,834 --> 00:55:26,165
Well then, you don't get a light.

610
00:55:26,269 --> 00:55:27,896
Give me a light
and you can have a cigarette.

611
00:55:27,971 --> 00:55:29,563
You give me a cigarette,
then you can have a light.

612
00:55:29,639 --> 00:55:31,163
It doesn't work that way. I found them first.

613
00:55:31,274 --> 00:55:32,298
Don't tell me how it works.

614
00:55:32,442 --> 00:55:36,105
Here. Here. Where is that mirror?
You two shouldn't be smoking, anyway.

615
00:55:36,179 --> 00:55:37,669
You know it isn't good for you.

616
00:55:53,096 --> 00:55:54,324
Hello.

617
00:56:00,503 --> 00:56:02,994
That's Sara, my other sister.

618
00:56:04,874 --> 00:56:06,842
She was in an accident.

619
00:56:20,790 --> 00:56:22,348
Here I come.

620
00:56:25,228 --> 00:56:28,391
I always like to let them know
when I'm coming.

621
00:56:29,499 --> 00:56:31,797
- We're ready to eat now.
Wonderful!

622
00:56:31,868 --> 00:56:32,892
Well, that's marvelous!

623
00:56:33,002 --> 00:56:35,732
Great! I'm starving.
Me, too. Me, too.

624
00:56:43,079 --> 00:56:47,675
Well, let's get started.
I bet Anthony is really hungry.

625
00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:50,014
Come on, now. Here you go.

626
00:56:50,086 --> 00:56:51,576
Here's your sweater, dear.

627
00:56:51,688 --> 00:56:56,250
Well, now, you know, we are so happy
that you can eat with us.

628
00:56:56,359 --> 00:57:00,261
You know, Anthony is so thoughtful
about things like that.

629
00:57:00,363 --> 00:57:02,831
Would you like to sit beside me?

630
00:57:03,233 --> 00:57:05,565
- Maybe your mother would...
- Oh, no, no, no.

631
00:57:05,668 --> 00:57:08,159
You see, I'm going to have
to be fixing supper.

632
00:57:08,238 --> 00:57:09,603
Yes, that's right.

633
00:57:09,706 --> 00:57:11,936
You sit right next to Anthony.

634
00:57:12,041 --> 00:57:14,509
Oh, that's fine. Just fine.

635
00:57:14,577 --> 00:57:16,772
- All right. All right.
- Very good, yes.

636
00:57:25,255 --> 00:57:26,882
<i>Now, you listen to me,</i>

637
00:57:26,956 --> 00:57:29,516
<i>don't you dare bring
one more thing into this house!</i>

638
00:57:29,592 --> 00:57:32,117
<i>Do you hear me? One more thing!</i>

639
00:57:32,228 --> 00:57:35,288
<i>Not one solitary single thing!</i>

640
00:57:36,599 --> 00:57:38,032
<i>A mouse!</i>

641
00:57:40,036 --> 00:57:44,632
Darling, do you remember where supper is?

642
00:57:45,308 --> 00:57:47,208
You know where it is.

643
00:57:49,212 --> 00:57:52,704
- I do?
- In the oven, isn't it, Mother?

644
00:57:54,384 --> 00:57:57,751
Oh, yes! Yes, of course! Of course.

645
00:58:00,056 --> 00:58:02,991
- How silly of me.
- She never knows.

646
00:58:03,092 --> 00:58:07,893
- I'll help you find it, Mother.
- We'll be back in just a little while.

647
00:58:09,098 --> 00:58:11,123
<i>We cartoon characters
can have a wonderful life,</i>

648
00:58:11,234 --> 00:58:13,168
<i>if we only take advantage of it.</i>

649
00:58:13,269 --> 00:58:18,002
<i>- We can do anything we think of.
- What do you mean, chum?</i>

650
00:58:18,107 --> 00:58:20,769
<i>Well, supposing I decide
I want to be a mouse.</i>

651
00:58:21,344 --> 00:58:22,572
<i>I'm a mouse.</i>

652
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:25,511
This is a good cartoon.

653
00:58:27,784 --> 00:58:30,947
- What else do you like?
- Nothing else is as good.

654
00:58:31,654 --> 00:58:33,952
Anything can happen in cartoons.

655
00:58:34,023 --> 00:58:37,686
- Here we go!
- Good eatings for everybody.

656
00:58:37,794 --> 00:58:40,786
- Yummy, yummy, yummy!
- Yes, sir.

657
00:58:40,863 --> 00:58:42,353
All right, all right, come on.

658
00:58:42,465 --> 00:58:47,368
Anthony, this is yours, dear,
in your regular place right there.

659
00:58:47,470 --> 00:58:50,337
And, Helen, why don't you sit right here
next to Anthony.

660
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:52,772
- This is for you, Uncle Walt.
- Thank you.

661
00:58:52,842 --> 00:58:54,309
- There we are.
- Here you go, Mother.

662
00:58:54,377 --> 00:58:56,937
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Mother.

663
00:58:58,548 --> 00:59:00,948
You're welcome, Anthony.

664
00:59:15,064 --> 00:59:18,192
- I love this. This is great.
- It really hits the spot.

665
00:59:21,004 --> 00:59:22,369
Okay?

666
00:59:22,905 --> 00:59:24,236
Fine.

667
00:59:32,749 --> 00:59:35,377
Peanut butter. It's good that way.

668
00:59:38,688 --> 00:59:42,920
- Peanut butter makes the burger.
- That's right. That's right.

669
00:59:43,026 --> 00:59:45,324
Wouldn't go down otherwise.

670
00:59:46,863 --> 00:59:48,387
Peanut butter's good for you.

671
00:59:52,035 --> 00:59:54,003
I could eat another plateful.

672
01:00:04,447 --> 01:00:06,005
Do you eat like this all the time?

673
01:00:06,082 --> 01:00:09,347
Anthony can always have
anything he wants.

674
01:00:09,419 --> 01:00:11,853
- Anything at all.
- You bet.

675
01:00:11,921 --> 01:00:14,412
Well, don't you think it's good?

676
01:00:15,124 --> 01:00:18,093
You're young. You need your nutrition.

677
01:00:18,428 --> 01:00:21,192
You can't eat like this all the time.

678
01:00:32,141 --> 01:00:34,439
It's not good all the time.

679
01:00:35,645 --> 01:00:39,206
- No, it's not!
- Anthony, that is absolutely right!

680
01:00:39,716 --> 01:00:42,412
- You hit the nail on the head!
- You are so right!

681
01:00:42,919 --> 01:00:45,080
You never tell me that!

682
01:00:49,092 --> 01:00:50,423
<i>Not happy birthday!</i>

683
01:00:50,493 --> 01:00:54,293
<i>No, not happy birthday!</i>

684
01:00:55,131 --> 01:00:58,294
Of course! It's a birthday supper.

685
01:00:59,235 --> 01:01:03,797
Another birthday? With presents?
And wishes?

686
01:01:07,143 --> 01:01:08,735
I didn't do it!

687
01:01:11,948 --> 01:01:14,610
It's okay. Everything's okay.

688
01:01:15,685 --> 01:01:18,449
I'm sorry, Anthony.
I really have to be going.

689
01:01:18,521 --> 01:01:20,318
No, please don't go!

690
01:01:21,591 --> 01:01:24,025
Uncle Walt's gonna do a trick!

691
01:01:24,994 --> 01:01:26,120
He's gonna do a trick.

692
01:01:26,195 --> 01:01:28,857
Oh, you've got to stay for the trick!

693
01:01:28,965 --> 01:01:30,660
He's going to do a trick!

694
01:01:30,767 --> 01:01:33,133
Come back. Come back. Wait. Wait.

695
01:01:33,202 --> 01:01:35,762
- Do the hat trick, Uncle Walt.
- Yes. Oh, yes.

696
01:01:35,838 --> 01:01:39,433
- Where's the hat?
- It's on the TV.

697
01:01:43,646 --> 01:01:47,013
- There it is. All right.
- Now, then, you've got to stay here.

698
01:01:47,116 --> 01:01:48,708
You sit right down there.

699
01:01:50,386 --> 01:01:52,616
The hat trick.

700
01:01:53,456 --> 01:01:55,287
Well, let's see.

701
01:01:56,626 --> 01:02:01,791
Nothing up the sleeve. There we go.
That's it. Nothing up the sleeve. See that?

702
01:02:05,635 --> 01:02:09,969
Well, nothing up the sleeve and...

703
01:02:11,140 --> 01:02:16,043
And... I beg your pardon. Excuse me. Yes.

704
01:02:16,145 --> 01:02:19,478
- Go ahead, Uncle Walt.
- Oh, yes, yes.

705
01:02:19,549 --> 01:02:22,575
But the hat. Where's the hat?

706
01:02:28,391 --> 01:02:30,757
Nothing, as you can see, in the hat, right?

707
01:02:31,894 --> 01:02:34,488
Nothing in the hat.

708
01:02:36,065 --> 01:02:37,157
So...

709
01:02:38,601 --> 01:02:42,765
You'll like this. Do it, Uncle Walt!

710
01:02:44,006 --> 01:02:45,405
Yes, sir.

711
01:02:51,714 --> 01:02:54,444
- Go ahead, Uncle Walt!
- Yes.

712
01:03:18,541 --> 01:03:19,769
You see?

713
01:03:20,810 --> 01:03:22,744
Isn't this fun? We do it a lot.

714
01:03:22,812 --> 01:03:25,872
- You'll love it here.
- You'll really like it here. Really. I promise.

715
01:03:25,948 --> 01:03:28,473
- I swear you'll like it.
- Do more!

716
01:03:39,428 --> 01:03:40,656
Go away!

717
01:03:50,406 --> 01:03:53,898
Please don't go, Helen.
I can make it real nice here.

718
01:03:53,976 --> 01:03:57,309
I can make the food
just the way you said it should be.

719
01:03:57,413 --> 01:03:59,608
I can even change the house.

720
01:04:00,516 --> 01:04:04,316
Just say it and I can make
whatever you like. Just don't...

721
01:04:11,861 --> 01:04:14,830
I told you. They hate me!

722
01:04:14,931 --> 01:04:17,092
They want to send me away
to someplace bad

723
01:04:17,166 --> 01:04:19,691
just like my real mother and father did.

724
01:04:19,802 --> 01:04:22,270
That's not right, Anthony.
You know we wouldn't do that.

725
01:04:22,338 --> 01:04:24,863
No, we love you, Anthony. Honestly, we do.

726
01:04:24,974 --> 01:04:26,965
- Sure.
They're afraid of me!

727
01:04:27,043 --> 01:04:29,375
Everybody is.
That's why they act that way.

728
01:04:29,478 --> 01:04:31,378
And I do everything for them.

729
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:34,142
They can just sit around
and watch TV all day.

730
01:04:34,216 --> 01:04:37,014
No one has to do a thing. Not a thing!

731
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:40,384
- And I'm real good all the time.
- That's right. You're a good boy, Anthony.

732
01:04:40,489 --> 01:04:44,220
- You're a good boy. We love you.
- Yeah.

733
01:04:44,327 --> 01:04:47,125
Well, then, I wonder who wrote this note.

734
01:04:47,196 --> 01:04:50,165
I wonder who called me a monster.

735
01:04:50,232 --> 01:04:51,665
It wasn't me, Anthony.

736
01:04:51,734 --> 01:04:54,965
Why, I'd never do anything like that,
you know that.

737
01:04:55,037 --> 01:04:58,734
- Don't look at me.
- Me either!

738
01:04:58,841 --> 01:05:01,139
It wasn't any of us, Anthony. It was her!

739
01:05:01,210 --> 01:05:03,701
- No. It wasn't me!
- No, her, her. Ethel! Ethel!

740
01:05:03,813 --> 01:05:06,543
It must have been Ethel.
Of course, it had to have been Ethel.

741
01:05:06,649 --> 01:05:07,843
- That's right.
- Yes.

742
01:05:07,917 --> 01:05:11,853
Ethel! There you are. It was Ethel.
That's right.

743
01:05:11,988 --> 01:05:15,583
- Oh, great.
It had to have been Ethel.

744
01:05:15,691 --> 01:05:17,989
Of course, it was Ethel. Of course.

745
01:05:18,060 --> 01:05:21,860
Oh, I didn't know that.

746
01:05:21,931 --> 01:05:25,594
What a big surprise. Ethel, huh?

747
01:05:25,701 --> 01:05:29,398
Go ahead, Anthony. Do it! Do it!

748
01:05:29,505 --> 01:05:31,666
Do what, Ethel?

749
01:05:31,741 --> 01:05:34,369
Now, do you realize
you'll never get out of here?

750
01:05:34,443 --> 01:05:36,843
You think it was an accident
you came here?

751
01:05:36,912 --> 01:05:38,573
He made it happen.

752
01:05:38,681 --> 01:05:43,209
He brought you here, just like
he brought us here and kept us here.

753
01:05:43,285 --> 01:05:46,083
Just the way he'll keep you here.

754
01:05:46,188 --> 01:05:49,123
Maybe he'll get mad at you
like he did to his real sister

755
01:05:49,225 --> 01:05:50,624
and cripple you and take away your mouth

756
01:05:50,726 --> 01:05:53,786
so you won't be able
to yell at him anymore.

757
01:05:53,896 --> 01:05:58,299
Or maybe he'll do to you
what he did to his real mother and father.

758
01:05:58,401 --> 01:06:01,029
Time for you to go now, Ethel.

759
01:06:03,139 --> 01:06:06,575
- Anthony, don't!
- It's a big surprise.

760
01:06:09,278 --> 01:06:11,143
I just made it up.

761
01:06:13,649 --> 01:06:16,083
I'm wishing you into cartoonland.

762
01:06:22,925 --> 01:06:24,085
Jesus.

763
01:06:24,994 --> 01:06:27,224
I told you cartoons are good.

764
01:06:31,434 --> 01:06:35,734
- Anything can happen in them.
- We've been expecting you.

765
01:06:45,848 --> 01:06:48,316
Run, Ethel! Run!

766
01:07:07,002 --> 01:07:09,027
That's all, Ethel.

767
01:07:18,180 --> 01:07:21,809
I can't help it, Helen.
I don't want to hurt anybody.

768
01:07:21,884 --> 01:07:25,149
All I want is for people
not to be afraid of me.

769
01:07:27,857 --> 01:07:31,315
You don't understand. Nobody does.

770
01:07:32,228 --> 01:07:35,823
All I have to do is wish for something
and it happens.

771
01:07:35,898 --> 01:07:37,889
I can do anything.

772
01:07:39,502 --> 01:07:40,867
Anything!

773
01:09:15,598 --> 01:09:17,828
Wish it away, Anthony.

774
01:09:20,469 --> 01:09:22,096
Wish it away!

775
01:09:41,690 --> 01:09:43,624
I hate this house!

776
01:09:45,594 --> 01:09:47,687
I hate everything about it.

777
01:09:49,031 --> 01:09:53,024
I wish it away. I wish it all away!

778
01:10:01,810 --> 01:10:03,209
Anthony?

779
01:10:04,146 --> 01:10:06,944
- Where are we?
- Nowhere.

780
01:10:08,951 --> 01:10:10,213
And the others?

781
01:10:10,686 --> 01:10:14,986
I sent them where they wanted to go,
away from me.

782
01:10:15,858 --> 01:10:17,621
It's not fair.

783
01:10:17,693 --> 01:10:20,958
You're supposed to be happy
when your wishes come true.

784
01:10:21,030 --> 01:10:24,659
You're supposed to be happy
when your wishes come true.

785
01:10:27,403 --> 01:10:29,303
Anthony, take us back.

786
01:10:30,906 --> 01:10:32,305
Take us back.

787
01:10:32,374 --> 01:10:34,239
So you can leave, too?

788
01:10:37,046 --> 01:10:38,980
And go where, Anthony?

789
01:10:40,516 --> 01:10:42,575
I've seen what you can do.

790
01:10:43,385 --> 01:10:48,152
I know you have a power,
a gift that makes you special.

791
01:10:50,559 --> 01:10:52,390
You better be careful,

792
01:10:54,363 --> 01:10:56,194
or one day

793
01:10:58,434 --> 01:11:01,403
it may become too big for you to control.

794
01:11:03,372 --> 01:11:06,068
Now, maybe, just maybe,

795
01:11:07,276 --> 01:11:11,212
together we can master it
and learn from it,

796
01:11:12,414 --> 01:11:15,406
use it in ways you never thought of before.

797
01:11:17,052 --> 01:11:19,418
I'd like to be your teacher, Anthony,

798
01:11:20,622 --> 01:11:22,180
and your student.

799
01:11:24,059 --> 01:11:25,959
You'd stay with me?

800
01:11:27,196 --> 01:11:28,220
Yes.

801
01:11:29,231 --> 01:11:30,528
Always?

802
01:11:35,304 --> 01:11:36,771
Always.

803
01:11:40,576 --> 01:11:41,941
Okay.

804
01:12:04,333 --> 01:12:05,630
Anthony,

805
01:12:07,336 --> 01:12:10,430
let's not do too much more of that, okay?

806
01:12:10,973 --> 01:12:12,998
- Sure.
- Okay.

807
01:12:24,987 --> 01:12:26,352
All right.

808
01:12:28,590 --> 01:12:30,421
Look in your pocket.

809
01:12:39,334 --> 01:12:40,699
Never mind.

810
01:13:48,003 --> 01:13:49,868
<i>What you're
looking at could be the end</i>

811
01:13:49,938 --> 01:13:52,270
<i>of a particularly terrifying nightmare.</i>

812
01:13:52,374 --> 01:13:55,502
<i>It isn't. It's the beginning.</i>

813
01:13:55,577 --> 01:13:59,445
<i>Introducing Mr. John Valentine,
air traveler.</i>

814
01:13:59,548 --> 01:14:03,177
<i>His destination, the Twilight Zone.</i>

815
01:14:20,869 --> 01:14:22,860
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
this storm has developed</i>

816
01:14:22,938 --> 01:14:24,963
<i>a little faster than we had anticipated.</i>

817
01:14:25,073 --> 01:14:26,199
<i>We're maneuvering about,</i>

818
01:14:26,275 --> 01:14:29,142
<i>finding the smoothest spots with radar.</i>

819
01:14:29,244 --> 01:14:32,111
<i>There's still a chance that we might hit
some uh-ohs and whoopsy-daisies,</i>

820
01:14:33,382 --> 01:14:36,317
<i>So I'm asking you to return to your seats
and fasten your seat belts.</i>

821
01:14:36,418 --> 01:14:38,579
<i>Please extinguish your cigarettes</i>

822
01:14:38,654 --> 01:14:41,214
<i>or anything that might fly about
in the aircraft,</i>

823
01:14:41,290 --> 01:14:42,780
<i>look out the window and enjoy...</i>

824
01:14:42,891 --> 01:14:44,415
Hello in there.

825
01:14:45,961 --> 01:14:47,622
Can you hear me?

826
01:14:48,997 --> 01:14:50,487
Hello.

827
01:14:53,001 --> 01:14:57,097
Oh, hi. It's a passenger that's
been in there for a long time.

828
01:14:58,006 --> 01:15:01,169
- Tall? Fair-haired?
- Yeah. Yeah. Seat 4A.

829
01:15:01,276 --> 01:15:02,470
Oh, yeah, Valentine.

830
01:15:02,578 --> 01:15:04,443
I had a feeling about him.
White-knuckle type.

831
01:15:04,513 --> 01:15:06,242
How are we gonna get him out
of the bathroom?

832
01:15:06,315 --> 01:15:08,112
- Is there something wrong?
- No, no, no. Everything's fine.

833
01:15:08,183 --> 01:15:11,084
Mr. Valentine? May I help you?

834
01:15:12,754 --> 01:15:14,449
Just a moment.

835
01:15:54,830 --> 01:15:58,891
Dionne, why don't you knock?
Something could be wrong.

836
01:15:59,001 --> 01:16:03,028
Let's give him a few more minutes.
Are you okay?

837
01:16:04,573 --> 01:16:05,835
No problem.

838
01:16:05,907 --> 01:16:09,843
Look, Mr. Valentine, I know how you feel.
Lots of people are nervous about flying.

839
01:16:09,911 --> 01:16:13,244
But if you look at statistics,
you're safer up here than on the ground.

840
01:16:13,348 --> 01:16:15,009
That's right.
Safer than your own bathroom.

841
01:16:15,083 --> 01:16:16,914
No, I'll be perfectly fine.

842
01:16:19,087 --> 01:16:20,384
Oh, dear!

843
01:16:20,489 --> 01:16:23,253
Everything's gonna be fine.
We're gonna help you back to your seat.

844
01:16:23,358 --> 01:16:25,519
Actually, the chances of drowning
in the bathroom,

845
01:16:25,594 --> 01:16:28,222
the bathtub, is something
like 8/100,000 of a percent,

846
01:16:28,330 --> 01:16:31,925
whereas air crash fatalities
from last year's figures,

847
01:16:32,034 --> 01:16:34,400
the number of passengers
who traveled by air last year,

848
01:16:34,503 --> 01:16:36,027
is equal to the population
of the whole country.

849
01:16:36,104 --> 01:16:37,731
That's...

850
01:16:37,839 --> 01:16:42,936
That's 426,504,000... I forget the rest.

851
01:16:43,045 --> 01:16:47,277
The people who died at home,
they outnumber the people...

852
01:16:48,617 --> 01:16:49,743
...much more than...

853
01:16:49,851 --> 01:16:52,342
Whereas driving... Driving, forget it.

854
01:16:52,421 --> 01:16:58,417
The percentage of people
who die driving, 22, 23 of...

855
01:16:59,795 --> 01:17:02,457
- Do I need my boarding pass?
- No, you don't.

856
01:17:02,564 --> 01:17:05,055
Watch your head. Watch your head.

857
01:17:07,369 --> 01:17:09,234
That a boy.

858
01:17:09,304 --> 01:17:11,295
I think I spilled my drink.

859
01:17:12,407 --> 01:17:14,375
I think I spilled my drink.

860
01:17:14,443 --> 01:17:17,241
Oh, I'm sorry, sir. Here, let me fix you up.

861
01:17:17,913 --> 01:17:20,211
Let me put things away here.

862
01:17:22,150 --> 01:17:25,244
<i>Micro Chip Logic,
The Liberation of the Left Brain.</i>

863
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:29,757
- Science fiction fan, huh?
- No, that's a textbook. Computers.

864
01:17:29,825 --> 01:17:32,623
- Do you really read this stuff?
- I wrote it.

865
01:17:32,728 --> 01:17:34,889
Oh, my goodness, so you did.

866
01:17:34,963 --> 01:17:38,091
I'll tell you what, we'll put this away,
and you try to get some sleep.

867
01:17:38,166 --> 01:17:41,499
No, no, no...
I'd like you to leave the light on.

868
01:17:41,603 --> 01:17:45,232
Okay. I'll take this. Okay? Come on.

869
01:17:46,174 --> 01:17:48,802
Tell you what. I'll put this in a safe place.

870
01:17:48,910 --> 01:17:52,471
Look, you're gonna be fine,
so cheer up, okay?

871
01:17:52,581 --> 01:17:54,310
Get some water.

872
01:17:57,352 --> 01:17:58,842
Let's get this seat belt fastened.

873
01:17:58,954 --> 01:18:02,185
- What? Is something wrong?
- No, no, everything's fine.

874
01:18:03,091 --> 01:18:07,187
Look, we're not supposed to do this,
but I have these sedatives.

875
01:18:07,295 --> 01:18:10,128
- They might help you sleep.
- No, it's...

876
01:18:10,198 --> 01:18:12,928
It's all right. I don't need anything.
I'll be fine.

877
01:18:13,001 --> 01:18:17,131
- They're very mild.
- No. Thank you, but I'll be all right.

878
01:18:19,207 --> 01:18:21,869
- This will cost you four bucks.
- What did you say?

879
01:18:21,977 --> 01:18:24,468
- Only kidding.
- Well, I'm not kidding.

880
01:18:24,546 --> 01:18:25,945
We've got to get you back
to your seat now.

881
01:18:26,014 --> 01:18:28,005
- I want to stay here!
- Oh, no, no, no.

882
01:18:28,116 --> 01:18:29,947
We've got to get you back here.

883
01:18:30,285 --> 01:18:32,981
Here we go.
Now let's fasten your seat belt.

884
01:18:33,054 --> 01:18:35,648
- I don't need my seat belt fastened.
- Oh, yes, you do.

885
01:18:35,724 --> 01:18:37,351
We wouldn't want you to fall out.

886
01:18:37,459 --> 01:18:40,053
- I'm not gonna fall out.
- Not if you sit here, you won't.

887
01:18:40,162 --> 01:18:41,993
- Okay?
- Okay.

888
01:18:43,465 --> 01:18:46,161
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

889
01:18:46,234 --> 01:18:48,998
- Sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

890
01:18:49,070 --> 01:18:53,404
Look, I'm Dionne.
Anything you need, call me.

891
01:18:53,508 --> 01:18:57,000
Well, thank you, but I'm sure I'll be fine.

892
01:18:58,013 --> 01:19:00,379
Really, I'll be fine.

893
01:19:01,316 --> 01:19:02,340
Okay.

894
01:19:23,705 --> 01:19:26,230
You heard the Captain. No smoking.

895
01:19:26,341 --> 01:19:29,868
N- O S-M-O-K-I-N-G.

896
01:19:29,945 --> 01:19:31,742
No smoking!

897
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:14,539
There's something out there!

898
01:21:14,649 --> 01:21:17,379
There's something moving, I saw it!

899
01:21:19,321 --> 01:21:22,154
There's a man on the wing of this plane!

900
01:21:50,752 --> 01:21:52,151
There was somebody out there.

901
01:21:52,220 --> 01:21:55,986
- You've got to believe me!
- I saw him. Green and slimy.

902
01:21:56,057 --> 01:21:58,855
- Leave the poor man alone.
- I'm only trying to help.

903
01:21:58,927 --> 01:22:02,021
- You've got to humor them.
- There was lightning.

904
01:22:02,097 --> 01:22:04,930
At first I thought it was an animal,
some kind of a bird or something,

905
01:22:05,033 --> 01:22:06,193
but it was a man!

906
01:22:06,267 --> 01:22:09,361
There were flames
coming out of the engine,

907
01:22:09,437 --> 01:22:12,668
and then a flash and then smoke!

908
01:22:13,074 --> 01:22:17,238
Maybe it was a technician who was caught
on the plane when it took off.

909
01:22:17,345 --> 01:22:19,575
My God, how could he survive out there?
The air is too thin.

910
01:22:19,681 --> 01:22:24,084
The blast of the wind. It's... It's so cold.

911
01:22:30,625 --> 01:22:32,752
It's impossible, isn't it?

912
01:22:37,132 --> 01:22:40,465
My God. I feel so stupid.

913
01:22:53,214 --> 01:22:54,875
Can you imagine?

914
01:22:54,949 --> 01:22:59,409
A naked man crawling along the wing
of an airplane at 35,000 feet?

915
01:22:59,487 --> 01:23:02,388
There's no reason to feel embarrassed,
Mr. Valentine.

916
01:23:02,457 --> 01:23:07,622
- Just try to get some sleep.
- It's amazing, the mind,

917
01:23:07,962 --> 01:23:11,159
how the eyes can make you see
something that isn't even there.

918
01:23:11,266 --> 01:23:12,460
There's a man in seat 3F

919
01:23:12,567 --> 01:23:14,831
that's completely freaking out.

920
01:23:15,403 --> 01:23:17,234
Look, you're just gonna
have to deal with him.

921
01:23:17,305 --> 01:23:20,138
It's all right.
You don't have to stay with me.

922
01:23:20,241 --> 01:23:22,801
I know you have other passengers
to attend to.

923
01:23:22,911 --> 01:23:24,572
I'm happy to sit with you till you sleep.

924
01:23:24,646 --> 01:23:28,673
No, it's probably easier for me if I'm alone.

925
01:23:28,783 --> 01:23:30,648
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

926
01:23:31,786 --> 01:23:34,346
I'm drowsy already.

927
01:23:39,627 --> 01:23:42,596
- You see?
- Okay.

928
01:25:35,310 --> 01:25:37,244
Get the handcuffs.

929
01:25:51,826 --> 01:25:56,058
I'm all right! I'm all right! I'm all
right! Don't touch me! Don't touch me!

930
01:25:59,634 --> 01:26:02,501
FAA security.
You want me to take care of this?

931
01:26:02,604 --> 01:26:03,901
No. It's all right. He'll be all right.

932
01:26:03,972 --> 01:26:05,599
You've got to land the plane!
There's a man outside.

933
01:26:05,673 --> 01:26:07,641
- Just take your seat.
- You've got to let me outside.

934
01:26:08,743 --> 01:26:10,768
Could everybody sit down? Sit down!

935
01:26:10,845 --> 01:26:14,508
Get in your seats.
I want all the passengers in their seats.

936
01:26:15,950 --> 01:26:17,975
Yes, thank you very much.

937
01:26:18,820 --> 01:26:21,254
Get this thing on the ground!
You gotta get this thing onto the ground!

938
01:26:21,322 --> 01:26:23,290
- You gotta get this on the ground!
- Do you know where you are?

939
01:26:23,358 --> 01:26:24,848
- Mr. Valentine!
- Get us on the ground!

940
01:26:24,959 --> 01:26:27,951
- Take care of the little girl.
- Okay. Come here, darling.

941
01:26:28,029 --> 01:26:33,126
- Handcuffs! Far out!
- That's it. Relax.

942
01:26:33,201 --> 01:26:34,759
Come on, honey, you belong over here.

943
01:26:34,836 --> 01:26:37,327
- Mommy!
- That a girl, that's it.

944
01:26:37,438 --> 01:26:39,838
Mommy, a strange man, he's got me!

945
01:26:39,941 --> 01:26:41,966
My God, what has she done this time?

946
01:26:42,310 --> 01:26:44,141
Take deep breaths, Mr. Valentine.

947
01:26:44,212 --> 01:26:46,339
Deep, long breaths.

948
01:26:47,515 --> 01:26:49,483
Slow. Relax.

949
01:26:50,518 --> 01:26:54,284
That's it. We're safe.

950
01:26:56,224 --> 01:26:58,454
We're gonna have a little talk.

951
01:26:59,694 --> 01:27:01,855
What seems to be the problem?

952
01:27:04,699 --> 01:27:07,463
Will you look out that window, please?

953
01:27:16,844 --> 01:27:19,210
What was I supposed to see out there?

954
01:27:24,419 --> 01:27:25,716
Nothing.

955
01:27:26,921 --> 01:27:30,049
Nothing at all. I'm sorry I shouted.

956
01:27:30,158 --> 01:27:32,319
Mr. Valentine,
you've got to see this my way.

957
01:27:32,393 --> 01:27:35,658
I'm the First Officer of an airplane
in a severe storm.

958
01:27:35,730 --> 01:27:37,493
Now, I have an irrational passenger.

959
01:27:37,565 --> 01:27:39,226
You're threatening the safety
of this aircraft

960
01:27:39,334 --> 01:27:41,325
and you're frightening
the other passengers.

961
01:27:41,402 --> 01:27:43,870
You either calm down
or we're gonna handcuff you.

962
01:27:43,938 --> 01:27:46,668
Listen, there's something wrong
with this airplane!

963
01:27:46,741 --> 01:27:47,867
I don't care what happens to me,

964
01:27:47,942 --> 01:27:51,503
but if somebody doesn't do something
about it, we're all gonna die!

965
01:27:52,447 --> 01:27:55,883
- That's D-I-E, die!
- You big silly!

966
01:27:55,950 --> 01:27:57,941
You used to be a normal person!

967
01:27:58,052 --> 01:27:59,849
Sit down, darling. Come on, okay?

968
01:27:59,921 --> 01:28:04,881
Mr. Valentine, what do you think
is wrong with this aircraft?

969
01:28:07,628 --> 01:28:10,563
- There's an engine out.
- Which one?

970
01:28:11,232 --> 01:28:13,359
The one on the outside.

971
01:28:13,434 --> 01:28:16,232
Outboard number one. It's out, isn't it?

972
01:28:17,138 --> 01:28:21,302
- What makes you think that?
- Never mind about that. It's true, isn't it?

973
01:28:22,410 --> 01:28:25,038
Nine minutes ago, outboard number one
was struck by lightning.

974
01:28:25,113 --> 01:28:26,444
There was a flame-out, and we lost it.

975
01:28:26,547 --> 01:28:28,811
- Lightning.
- Lightning.

976
01:28:30,985 --> 01:28:34,580
Mr. Valentine,
this aircraft has four engines.

977
01:28:34,655 --> 01:28:37,954
The possibility of us losing one of the
remaining three is remote in the extreme.

978
01:28:38,059 --> 01:28:40,323
You're sure it was just lightning?

979
01:28:42,096 --> 01:28:43,461
Absolutely.

980
01:28:46,401 --> 01:28:50,167
Listen, we're gonna be landing
in about 20 minutes.

981
01:28:51,839 --> 01:28:56,003
There is the highest probability
that we'll survive this flight.

982
01:28:57,645 --> 01:28:58,669
Okay.

983
01:29:03,985 --> 01:29:08,115
We'll see you downstairs in 20 minutes.
Sit down. Buckle them up!

984
01:29:12,360 --> 01:29:13,952
Are you okay?

985
01:29:41,122 --> 01:29:43,454
No, no, no, no.

986
01:29:50,798 --> 01:29:51,890
I love you.

987
01:29:51,999 --> 01:29:54,467
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee...

988
01:30:37,111 --> 01:30:39,341
Mommy. Mommy. Mommy.

989
01:30:41,883 --> 01:30:45,842
What are you doing now?
That's very bad manners, you know!

990
01:30:46,587 --> 01:30:51,251
- Didn't anyone ever teach you manners?
- Come on. Come on.

991
01:31:00,434 --> 01:31:01,731
God damn!

992
01:31:37,772 --> 01:31:39,740
He's got a gun!

993
01:33:14,702 --> 01:33:19,935
And that's exactly how it happened.
I'm practically a hero.

994
01:33:20,675 --> 01:33:21,937
Would you believe that?

995
01:33:22,043 --> 01:33:26,173
Weather broke, we would
never have gotten this baby down.

996
01:33:26,247 --> 01:33:28,044
A hell of a night.

997
01:33:28,115 --> 01:33:31,949
We got the storm, we got the flame-out,
and then that freak show.

998
01:33:32,053 --> 01:33:35,386
Not to mention the gun.
The gun was awful.

999
01:33:35,456 --> 01:33:39,256
He didn't have a gun. No, no, no,
he didn't have a gun. It was my gun.

1000
01:33:39,360 --> 01:33:41,385
It was my gun. I'm FAA.
I'm authorized to have a gun.

1001
01:33:41,462 --> 01:33:45,796
He was so crazy. He smashed the window.
What was he trying to do? Get out?

1002
01:33:45,900 --> 01:33:49,233
It's claustrophobia! They'd rather fall
to the ground than stay aboard.

1003
01:33:49,303 --> 01:33:52,295
I've seen it happen. I've seen it!

1004
01:33:52,406 --> 01:33:54,806
I knew he was frightened,
but I didn't think he was crazy.

1005
01:33:54,909 --> 01:33:57,434
But, Dionne,
he said he saw something on the wing.

1006
01:33:57,545 --> 01:34:00,275
Max, we lost number one.
Check out number two, will you?

1007
01:34:01,549 --> 01:34:03,813
All right. Somebody give me a light.
I want the gear pin.

1008
01:34:03,918 --> 01:34:05,442
Let's check these tires.

1009
01:34:05,553 --> 01:34:08,420
Franco, let me know
what's going on with these flaps.

1010
01:34:08,489 --> 01:34:11,481
I want to know if there's any fuel
leaking out of this baby.

1011
01:34:11,592 --> 01:34:13,753
And get these people out of here.

1012
01:34:25,272 --> 01:34:28,764
Max! Max! Max!

1013
01:34:32,346 --> 01:34:34,405
Holy Toledo!

1014
01:34:34,482 --> 01:34:37,417
Hey, you guys, what happened up there?

1015
01:34:49,330 --> 01:34:51,594
That's enough of that noise, huh?

1016
01:34:51,665 --> 01:34:54,930
Who needs it anyway?
How about a little music?

1017
01:34:55,002 --> 01:34:56,264
Sure.

1018
01:35:03,711 --> 01:35:06,839
Hey, that's... That's...

1019
01:35:08,382 --> 01:35:10,612
I love Creedence.

1020
01:35:12,186 --> 01:35:14,677
So you had a big scare up there, huh?

1021
01:35:15,356 --> 01:35:16,823
Oh, yeah.

1022
01:35:18,192 --> 01:35:20,626
Want to see something really scary?

1023
01:35:28,402 --> 01:35:32,964
<i>There is a fifth dimension
beyond that which is known to man.</i>

1024
01:35:33,040 --> 01:35:36,532
<i>It is the middle ground
between light and shadow,</i>

1025
01:35:36,644 --> 01:35:38,874
<i>between science and superstition,</i>

1026
01:35:38,979 --> 01:35:44,884
<i>and it lies between the pit of man's fears
and the summit of his knowledge.</i>

1027
01:35:44,985 --> 01:35:47,180
<i>This is the dimension of imagination.</i>

1028
01:35:47,254 --> 01:35:50,690
<i>It is an area which we call
the Twilight Zone.</i>

1029
01:41:09,476 --> 01:41:10,500
