00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,640
Of course.

654
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,200
You know, the couple that
prays together stays together.

655
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,960
What's this?

656
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,440
The Holy Bible.

657
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:43,080
There's one for you
and one for me.

658
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:45,520
Not very light, is it?

659
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,200
We're going
to Bible study.

660
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,040
The couple
that prays together

661
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,280
stays together.

662
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,360
I heard it was

663
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:56,560
the couple that lays together
stays together.

664
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:59,160
Well, you heard wrong.

665
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,520
Cheryl...

666
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,480
do you think you could
take this one?

667
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,040
Sure.

668
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,640
Sit right down here, ma'am.

669
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,440
We're going
to make you pretty.

670
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,120
Now how do you
like your hair?

671
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,920
What? Are you going
to do my hair?

672
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,120
No, I just need to know

673
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,600
if that's your usual way
of wearing it...

674
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:17,720
all big and high.

675
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,080
If it is,
I'll just put more makeup

676
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,840
on your chin
to offset it.

677
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,360
You're going
to want to take

678
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,960
a whole bottle
of this home with you.

679
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,720
It's got quite a lot
of ingredients in it...

680
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,160
so you're getting
a good deal.

681
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,440
It's got
ginkgo extract in it.

682
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,720
Do you know what that is?

683
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,680
No.

684
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,400
It's extract
of the ginkgo...

685
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,800
and it makes
your skin real slick

686
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:36,120
so that any liquid
will roll right off you...

687
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:39,040
be it water,
or lemon juice, or urine.

688
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,960
I'll put it
in a bag for you.

689
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:45,880
Phil...

690
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,080
what are you doing?

691
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,560
what are you doing?

692
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,440
What?

693
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,400
We're going to be late
for Bible study.

694
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,360
You're stoned.
You got paint in your hair.

695
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,200
Would you get in
the shower, dummy?

696
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,000
I completely
didn't remember.

697
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,880
Ohh, get in the shower.

698
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,400
[ Sighs ]

699
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,920
Working on
your spiritual life?

700
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,120
Yeah, I guess.

701
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,160
Ain't that
a hoot and a holler?

702
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,800
What do you mean?

703
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,200
I saw you, Justine.

704
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,520
You saw me what?

705
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:29,720
I saw you.

706
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,720
We got some things
to talk about...

707
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,160
you and me.

708
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:41,600
You come by my house
tomorrow after work...

709
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,200
if you know
what's good for you.

710
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,960
Hey...

711
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,320
where's Bubba?

712
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,640
He left.

713
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,840
Well, I'm ready.
Let's go.

714
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:25,480
I don't know what
to say about Jesus.

715
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,240
I'm stoned.

716
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:30,400
Just let the other people
do the talking.

717
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:32,520
Oh, geez...

718
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,800
we forgot
the Bibles, Justine.

719
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:37,320
Well, that's all right,
they'll forgive us.

720
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,640
Howdy. Welcome.

721
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,400
Hey there, people.

722
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,920
Glad you could make it.

723
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,040
Hi, Corny.

724
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,000
This is my husband--

725
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:46,960
Phil.

726
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:47,920
Howdy, Phil.

727
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,600
Y'all are in for a treat.

728
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,880
We got a good discussion
planned for tonight.

729
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,360
If man is made
in God's image...

730
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:56,200
what does that
say about God?

731
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,680
Yeah, that sounds
like a good one, man.

732
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,800
Hey, Brandon,
I want to talk to you

733
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,000
about the casting of
Pilgrim's Progress.

734
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:12,520
Phil, come
with me to the car.

735
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:13,600
What?

736
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:16,000
Come with me to the car.
I got to get something.

737
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:21,520
What are you doing?

738
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:22,720
Get in the car.

739
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,680
Just get
in the car, Phil.

740
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,600
What the hell?

741
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,520
I don't want
to go to Bible study.

742
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:32,640
Why not?

743
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,200
Because I don't want to.

744
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,440
Now let's just
get out of here.

745
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,560
Justine,
this is embarrassing.

746
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,000
We're running away
from Bible study

747
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,680
like a couple of
devil worshipers.

748
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:44,240
I don't care.
I'm not in the mood.

749
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:47,120
You are
freaking me out, man.

750
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,480
Why?

751
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,040
Why?

752
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:53,680
Because we forgot
our Bibles is why.

753
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:54,920
You just said 2 seconds ago

754
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,240
they'd forgive us.

755
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:59,240
Well, they may not,
all right?

756
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:02,000
So can we please just
get the shit out of here?

757
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,040
All right.

758
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,840
I'm never going back
to Bible study again.

759
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,280
I can tell you that much.

760
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:08,600
I don't care.
Fine by me. Let's just go.

761
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,640
Woman: I look too white,
don't you think?

762
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:21,120
Not at all. I'm just trying
to match your face with your hair.

763
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:23,080
I was thinking
you're not white enough.

764
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,440
I think I look
kind of weird.

765
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,360
The first rule of fashion

766
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,960
is you have to look weird.

767
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,440
What I'm doing has come
straight here from France.

768
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:32,560
Oh?

769
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:33,960
It's called Cirque du Face...

770
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,480
meaning
"Circus of the Face,"

771
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:37,680
and it's all the rage
with the Frenchies, ma'am.

772
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,640
Well, you're
the professional.

773
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:40,680
That's right...

774
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,600
and you're in good hands.

775
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,120
Corny: Justine,
what happened to you?

776
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,880
I looked over,
and I saw you two driving off

777
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:48,960
like vampires in the night.

778
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,240
Oh, gee...

779
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:52,440
we--we forgot our Bibles.

780
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:54,280
Well, you could have just
looked on with your neighbor.

781
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:55,560
It's a church, you know.

782
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:58,200
You can't make water without
bumping your nut on a Bible.

783
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:00,840
Well, we felt bad.

784
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:04,800
What in blazes?

785
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:07,120
Do you like it?

786
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:09,920
I can't go.

787
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:11,000
What?

788
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:12,720
I can't go today.

789
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:13,680
There's something important

790
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,480
that I have to tend to.

791
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:17,840
I thought you said
we'd go today.

792
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:20,560
Yeah, something came up.

793
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:23,800
Well, what?
What came up?

794
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:26,240
OK, look, uh--

795
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:28,400
I think, um, maybe...

796
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:30,920
somebody has found out about us.

797
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:37,560
Well, I'm starting to wonder
if you even want to go.

798
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:41,320
I'm starting to think
you don't get me.

799
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,440
Maybe I don't get you.

800
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:58,680
You do! You do get me!

801
00:44:58,760 --> 00:44:59,760
You just don't
want to get me...

802
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:01,800
because I'm
too intensified for you.

803
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,600
Justine, who cares--

804
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:05,080
Who cares
if someone found out?

805
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,080
Look, we don't have to
live like this, Justine.

806
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,200
I know what it's like
to go home every night

807
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:10,720
and feel like
you're hiding out.

808
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:12,200
We can leave
all this behind.

809
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:13,640
That's easy for you
to say, Holden.

810
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:14,880
You are not married.

811
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,280
Are you just
going to give up?

812
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:17,320
You going to go
crawling back?

813
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:19,240
Holden, you are going
to get us caught!

814
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:20,480
You're so
fucking frightened...

815

Justine:
Bubba sat like that

00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:14,440
for what seemed like 10 years
before he began to speak.

845
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:16,240
Finally,
when he opened his mouth...

846
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:17,320
he talked a blue streak

847
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:20,600
about the sad ruin
that was his life.

848

He talked about
how he loved Phil...

and how he loved me...

850

and how he always wanted
a girlfriend just like me

851

and to be a guy like Phil

to this imaginary girl
like me who he never found.

853
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:34,880
Then he started on about
giving up your dreams

854
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,320
and how it's all a part
of getting older.

Bubba had given up
his dream of being Phil.

He had accepted his fate
of being Bubba...

always and forever.

858

Then last week...

859
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,280
a door that had
always been shut

860
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,440
swung wide open.

861

Bubba felt that this
was no chance coincidence.

862
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:07,080
A cosmic force was at work.

863

The sounds of me making love
to a man who wasn't Phil

864
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:11,200
was like
a shout in Bubba's ear

865
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:13,280
from the Creator himself.

866
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:22,520
What it meant,
or what to do or why...

867
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:24,400
Bubba didn't know.

868
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:26,080
All he knew
was that he hated me

869
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:27,960
for poisoning
the well of idealism

870

from which he had drunk
for so long.

871
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:34,080
I was no longer Bubba's image
of perfection.

872
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,680
I was just
a liar and a whore...

873
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:40,160
and that sickened him.

874
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:41,280
But on the other hand...

875
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:43,040
he loved me
for opening his eyes

876
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:45,320
and releasing him from
the bitter chains of envy

877
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:48,200
that bound him to Phil.

878

Phil was no Superman...

882
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:00,680
just one thing
left for us to do...

883

something that would
solve both of our problems

I can't share you, Justine!

No, I don't.

I know you're angry,

what happened yesterday
was a wonderful thing.

ask you one thing.

Not in a place like this.

No, it's just stress.

"At least it can't
get any worse."

All right!

Phil: I knew it.

1146
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,920
Waste of time going
to that sperm doctor.

1147
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,200
We did it!

1148
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:53,280
We're going to have
ourselves a baby.

1149
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:55,920
Maybe.

1150
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:56,920
Tomorrow...

1151
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,840
we're going to celebrate
at Senor Tuna.

1152

to bring Bubba...

could be wrong, Phil.

1159
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:16,280
It's a little early
to be having a party.

1160
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:22,360
Well, let's do it
mellow then.

1161
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:27,080
You sure don't
seem too excited.

1162

Oh, I'm excited.

1164
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:33,640
you know, a lot of worries
come along with having a baby.

1165
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:36,920
Now don't think negative.

1166
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,240
Think positive.

1167
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:42,840
We could have ourselves
a tiny Phil...

or a tiny Teeny.

1169

Teeny's going to have
a teeny-weeny Teeny.

going to change...

don't you?

and you like
the people?

1239

You wouldn't want
to jeopardize all that

1240
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,640
by making some silly
error in judgment...

would you?

I'm sorry, Phil.

1470
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:01,400
I need to get stoned.

1471
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:04,480
OK.

1472
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:07,320
Get stoned.

1473
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:11,240
I just gotta escape,
you know?

1474
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:13,600
Yeah.

1475
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:17,440
Do you ever
feel like that...

1476
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:19,480
like you gotta escape?

1477
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,240
Yeah.

1478
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:23,760
Yeah, I do.

1479
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:48,280
What are those?

1480
01:21:48,360 --> 01:21:51,680
Fake eyelashes,
extra long.

1481
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:53,760
J-Just do it
normal for once.

1482
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:56,480
You want me to make
the other cheek purple

1483
01:21:56,560 --> 01:21:57,800
to even it out?

1484
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:00,640
No.

[ Man Grunts ]

1486
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:05,760
Cheryl: Did you
hear about Corny?

1487
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:07,040
He was going home

1488
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:09,000
after Bible study
last night...

1489
01:22:09,080 --> 01:22:11,120
and 2 beefy guys
with painted faces

1490
01:22:11,240 --> 01:22:14,480
pulled up in a truck
and jumped him.

1491
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:17,160
That's terrible.

1492
01:22:18,920 --> 01:22:19,840
Yeah.

1493
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:25,000
Justine:
That day, I read the story

1494
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:26,680
Holden wrote for me.

1495
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:31,760
It was kind of different
from the other ones

1496
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:33,360
but kind of the same.

1497
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:41,360
It was about a girl
who was put upon...

1498
01:22:41,480 --> 01:22:45,160
whose job
is like a prison

1499
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:48,560
and whose life
has lost all meaning.

1500
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:50,480
Other people
don't get her...

1501
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:51,920
...new places
all the time.

1502
01:22:52,040 --> 01:22:53,640
especially her husband.

1503
01:22:57,960 --> 01:23:00,040
One day she meets a boy
who's also put upon...

1504
01:23:00,160 --> 01:23:02,960
and they fall in love.

1505
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:10,200
After spending
their whole lives

1506
01:23:10,280 --> 01:23:12,080
never getting got...

1507
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:14,000
with one look...

1508
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:16,560
they get each other
completely.

1509
01:23:21,640 --> 01:23:23,440
That's my big baby.

1510
01:23:23,560 --> 01:23:25,800
In the end,
the girl and the boy

1511
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:28,880
run away together
into the wilderness...

1512
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,520
never to be heard from again.

Carried that gun
