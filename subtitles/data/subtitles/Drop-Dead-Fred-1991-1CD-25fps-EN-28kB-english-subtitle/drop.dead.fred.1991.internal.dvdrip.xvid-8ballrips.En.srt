1
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:47,620
"And the prince took the beautiful young girl
in his arms and said, "Will you marry me?"

2
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:52,780
""Yes,"she whispered,"I will be your princess.""

3
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:55,700
Did they live happily ever after?

4
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,980
Of course, Elizabeth.

5
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,700
How do you know?

6
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:04,380
Because she was a good little girl.

7
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:07,980
If she had been naughty,
the prince would have run away.

8
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,020
What a pile of shit.

9
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,260
Oh, Oharlie.

10
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,820
Oharles, this is really important to me.

11
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,420
I forgive you. OK?

12
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,420
I love you.

13
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,940
God, that hurts so much when I say it out loud.

14
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,620
OK, Lizzie.

15
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,780
Oharles, our marriage...

16
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:18,740
No, this is really important to me.

17
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,780
Oharles, this is really...

18
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,340
OK, Oharles.

19
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,940
Oharles...

20
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:33,340
- Lizzie, shouldn"t you be having lunch?
- This is important.

21
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,380
- Let me finish.
- You agreed.

22
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:39,260
You did more than agree.
It was your idea and you were right.

23
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:42,820
You were absolutely right. We can"t go on.

24
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:49,780
Sooner or later one of us has got to do something
positive for once in our life for both our sakes.

25
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,820
- And you did it.
- I did?

26
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,580
- Yes.
- Wait. When was it my idea?

27
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:58,260
The best thing is for me to go
and live with Annabella.

28
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,980
- I don"t think I said that.
- Yes.

29
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:04,180
- I did? Annabella? Is that her name?
- Yes.

30
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,100
Oh, God. I didn"t know that.

31
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:10,340
- All I know is what you did with her on our sofa.
- Lizzie, l"m sorry.

32
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:13,180
I couldn"t help myself.
L"ve been smitten by Annabella.

33
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,020
L"ve been bewitched by her.

34
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:20,420
I have been pounded flat on the anvil of love
like a piece of veal with a salad on top.

35
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:24,420
Excuse me. Oan I test-drive this car?

36
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:33,580
This car looks great topless.

37
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:37,060
I think a car should represent its owner, don"t you?

38
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,300
Oharles, this is really important to me.

39
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:44,220
Let"s not go through all this
l-never-want-to-see-you-again stuff

40
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:47,380
because we will want to see each other again.

41
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:50,060
We"re not going to throw away two years, are we?

42
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:53,100
It was three years... in June.

43
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:11,460
Janie, that"s what he said. He said he wants...

44
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:14,620
He wants to move out and go live with Annabella.

45
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,460
I know.

46
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,620
If I could just be alone with him.

47
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,300
Yes, it"s hard to look on the bright side but...

48
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,180
Mm-hm.

49
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:38,180
Yes. L"ve got my car.

50
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:43,380
I guess l"ll stay in the apartment
but, Janie, I really want him back.

51
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:46,420
If I could just get him alone and talk to him.

52
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,220
Janie?

53
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:53,580
Janie, hold on. Hold on a second.
L"m just gonna get some change.

54
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,580
Hey, that"s my car!

55
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,620
(Janie) "Elizabeth!

56
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:05,780
"Don"t spend any more money on Oharles.
Elizabeth, l"ll see you later anyway."

57
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:22,980
L"m so sorry, Your Honour.
I lost my money, my car, my husband.

58
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,780
All in one lunch hour?

59
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:30,500
- Yeah.
- Hey, do what I did. Plead insanity.

60
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:36,020
(Judge) Oounsel, advise your client
to keep his remarks to himself.

61
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:39,260
(Woman) Sorry, Your Honour.
May we finally proceed?

62
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:43,460
Just a moment. Oould the court reporter
approach the bench, please?

63
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,940
- L"m sorry.
- So am I.

64
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,980
You"re fired.

65
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,540
(Mouths)

66
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,180
- Thank you.
- Are you OK?

67
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,620
Mm-hm.

68
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,660
Lizzie?

69
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,700
- Elizabeth Oronin?
- Yeah.

70
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,380
L"m Michael. Mickey. L"m Mickey Bunce.

71
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:31,580
Used to live down the street
when we were little kids.

72
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,180
- Mickey. Goodness.
- Yeah!

73
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,020
- It"s been 20 years.
- At least.

74
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,860
- Do you work here?
- No.

75
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:40,620
- Neither do I.
- No. I had a divorce here.

76
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,660
- Divorce?
- Yes.

77
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:45,100
Ah, I don"t like that word.

78
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:49,660
You"ve got to work things through
if you don"t want to get divorced.

79
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:54,700
I gave it my best shot
but we"ve been separated two years now.

80
00:07:54,780 --> 00:08:00,220
The good thing about it is I got to keep
my daughter. That"s Natalie.

81
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:03,380
- She"s real pretty.
- She"s beautiful.

82
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:06,660
She"s a lot to handle.
She"s a lot like you used to be.

83
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,980
- Like me?
- Yeah.

84
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,460
What do you mean?

85
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:14,460
Don"t you remember
what you did to my grandmother?

86
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:17,820
- I didn"t do anything to her.
- You said the same thing then.

87
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,500
You said that Fred did it.

88
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:24,100
Drop Dead Fred.

89
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,620
(Young Elizabeth) Grandma Bunce!

90
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:38,700
- Drop Dead Fred.
- I used to pretend I had an imaginary friend.

91
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,780
No one believed me.

92
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:46,460
Do you remember the time you and Fred
came over to borrow my father"s electric shaver?

93
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,500
Yes.

94
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,180
(Oat squealing)

95
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:04,700
- You must have thought I was crazy.
- Not at all.

96
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:08,380
I believed you. It was just that
no one else could see him but you.

97
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:13,780
- He was so real.
- He was real all right. Really out of control.

98
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,860
No, not always.

99
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,900
Only when my mother was...

100
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,620
Well, you know.

101
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,740
Hey, we were all a little afraid of your mother.

102
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:28,140
Not Fred. No, he always stood up for me.

103
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:31,500
That"s what friends are for, even imaginary ones.

104
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:44,300
I realise you"re feeling pretty conflicted right now.

105
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,100
I feel awful.

106
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:52,580
I did this self-actualising workshop
and they taught us that pain is your friend.

107
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,980
- Pain makes you interesting.
- Janie.

108
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,460
Look at Elvis.

109
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,500
Yeah, but didn"t Elvis kill himself?

110
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,860
Yes, but before that he was interesting.

111
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:04,300
I want you to do some affirmations with me.

112
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,940
- Janie.
- Just do it.

113
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,060
Surround yourself with light.

114
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:11,260
Are you surrounded?

115
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,940
Yeah, I think so.

116
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:16,620
Repeat after me.
I don"t need a man to complete my life.

117
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:19,260
- I don"t need a man to complete my life.
- L"m perfect the way that I am.

118
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,900
- L"m perfect the way that I am.
- I hate Oharles.

119
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:24,420
I hate Oharles.

120
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,060
Don"t you feel better?

121
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,100
No.

122
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,780
I love him. I really do.

123
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,580
(Door opening)

124
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:38,260
(Janie) I feel basically it"s all about choice.

125
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:43,660
Since you"ve already chosen, what you may
as well do is to choose what you chose.

126
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:46,540
- I heard.
- Hello, Mother.

127
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:51,740
I came as soon as I heard.
It"s a good thing l"ve got a key to this apartment.

128
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:57,140
Hello, Mrs Oronin. She"ll be all right.
She needs some nurturing. Give her a cuddle.

129
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:03,900
Ouddling is for teddy bears. L"ve packed
your things. You"re coming home with me.

130
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:07,820
- L"m staying here tonight.
- Oharles is coming here later.

131
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:12,340
- I want to be here when he comes.
- Don"t disagree with your mother.

132
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,900
L"m staying here tonight. L"m staying here tonight.

133
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:26,380
Now that we"re home, everything is perfect.

134
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:40,820
- Don"t step on that carpet. I had it shampooed.
- Yes, Mother.

135
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,620
Take your things upstairs.

136
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,860
- I made up your bed.
- Oh.

137
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:49,380
Oh? That"s all you say to me?

138
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,460
- Thank you, Mother.
- That"s a good girl.

139
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,940
(Sobbing quietly)

140
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,460
(Music box plinks)

141
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,260
(ƒ Pop Goes The Weasel)

142
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,820
(Music speeds up)

143
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:28,220
(Stops)

144
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,580
(Plinks)

145
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:34,020
- Boo! Hello, snot face!
- Argh!

146
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:40,220
Yeugh! What happened to you? Look at you.
You"re all older. You"re even uglier.

147
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:45,180
Ugh! L"m sorry l"m going to have to be sick
all over you. Lie down. Hang on.

148
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:49,500
- Where"s all the dolls?
- Drop Dead Fred.

149
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,540
Where is the dolls?

150
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:54,820
I want to play with the... Aha! The dolls.

151
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:59,260
Hello, Jemima. Hello, Angelique. "Hello."
You"re going to die. Ah!

152
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,660
Mr Pooh.

153
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,700
"Hello." You die, too.

154
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:06,740
"No, no, no!" Yes, yes, yes.

155
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:12,980
"My intestines. Not my intestines!"

156
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:17,620
D-E-D.

157
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,460
I must be dreaming.

158
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:24,340
Where"s the fire truck and the rest of the toys?

159
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,220
They"re gone.

160
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,260
L"m grown up.

161
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,940
- Grown up?
- Uh-huh.

162
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,500
Grown up?

163
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,700
Great.

164
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:44,980
That means there"s a load
of grown-up things to smash.

165
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,020
Oome on!

166
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:50,300
- Where are we going?
- Play time!

167
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:52,260
Whee!

168
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:54,380
(Orunch)

169
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,420
Who put that there?

170
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:00,300
I forgot to give you something.

171
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,660
Ha-ha-ha!

172
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:11,220
Where is it? Oome on.
There must be some here somewhere.

173
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,660
Ah! Here it is.

174
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,060
Mind your backs.

175
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,420
Ooh! Oareful.

176
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,460
(Humming merrily)

177
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,780
L"ve got some dog poo right here.

178
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,900
(Squelch)

179
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:38,860
ƒ Dog poo, dog poo, lovely, lovely dog poo
dog poo on the chair

180
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:42,580
ƒ All along the side, all up here,
lovely, lovely smelly dog poo ƒ

181
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:46,980
- Elizabeth?
- Yeah, it"s me, Mother.

182
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:50,980
- L"m just getting a glass of water.
- Uh-huh.

183
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,900
Well, mind the carpet.

184
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:58,260
Hey, snot face, look. Ink.

185
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:02,420
Let"s write something on the carpet.
Let"s write, "Mother sucks."

186
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:06,580
No. Wait a minute. L"ve a better idea.
Let"s play a game.

187
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:10,100
- A game?
- Yeah, a game, like we used to, in the old days.

188
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:13,940
A game. OK. Great. But not dolls.

189
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:16,780
Not dolls cos we"re grown-ups now.

190
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,980
Not dolls. How about hide-and-seek?

191
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:22,780
Great. I love hide-and-seek.

192
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:26,340
Great. Maybe you should give me that inkwell first.

193
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:28,180
Sure. Here.

194
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,220
Oatch.

195
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:36,580
Nice catch. OK. Hide your eyes
and count to a million.

196
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:40,740
L"m going to hide in a place
where you"ll never find me. Bye-bye.

197
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,780
Four, five...

198
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,300
What am I doing?

199
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,500
What am I doing?

200
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,340
Oh, boy.

201
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,980
I don"t know what to say.

202
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:32,700
- I didn"t want anybody to walk on my carpet.
- Yeah, I know.

203
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:38,980
But here I am, scrubbing away at what
can only be described as dog mess.

204
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:44,900
Honestly, you"re not even back for a day
and you"re behaving like a five-year-old.

205
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:54,780
Mother, do you remember when I was little
I had this friend? He was make-believe.

206
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,380
No.

207
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:59,460
Don"t you remember I was
the only one who could see him?

208
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:02,300
No, I don"t remember Drop Dead Fred at all.

209
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,380
Morning.

210
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,700
So who"s for snot flicking?

211
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,660
(Plops in cup)

212
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:21,260
I hid all night in the stupid garden shed

213
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:24,300
and you didn"t even bother coming to look for me.

214
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,900
Oh, my God.

215
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,940
Is it? It is.

216
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:33,780
The megabitch. Let me at her!

217
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,500
- Is this for me?
- Get me an axe.

218
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:41,700
No, get me a chainsaw.
L"m going to slice her into tiny pieces.

219
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:45,900
Mother, are you going to be doing
any gardening today?

220
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:48,500
Well, it is a lovely day for it.

221
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:55,020
The death breath.
She killed me with the death breath.

222
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,060
Be gone, evil one!

223
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:04,820
Hey, maybe there"s a steak in there.
We can drive it through her heart.

224
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,460
Brrrr!

225
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:13,100
(Oreaking)

226
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:27,260
Phew.

227
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,220
Uh!

228
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:33,540
My head! The megabitch squashed my head!

229
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,740
The bitch. She squashed my head.

230
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:37,780
The evil one reigns supreme.

231
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:52,180
There"s nothing I can do.

232
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:01,340
Aah! Phew.

233
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,820
Wow.

234
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,660
Oobwebs.

235
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:18,180
What"s so funny?

236
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:21,820
Nothing. Would you come
sit here with me, Mother?

237
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:25,500
- Go away.
- You want me to go away?

238
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:28,660
All right. Fine. Say the magic words and l"ll piss off.

239
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:31,700
- Piss off.
- Gotcha. Those weren"t the magic words.

240
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:35,700
- What did you say to me?
- She told you to piss off. Are you deaf?

241
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:41,900
I said piss off but I did not say it to you.

242
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:46,540
Well, it"s no wonder Oharles left you.

243
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:49,500
You just don"t know how to make a marriage work.

244
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:54,620
You got married? You mean
you"ve been doing it like the pigeons? No.

245
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,100
Yuck!

246
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:01,900
(Fred) There they are. Which one of you two did it?
Was it you?

247
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:05,580
Whoever taught her how to do it
is going to get flattened.

248
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:12,060
(Fred shouting) There! Oome back!

249
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,100
She"s absolutely insane.

250
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:17,180
- Pigeon pie for you.
- Fred, stop!

251
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:22,780
So you got married.
Snot face grew up and got married.

252
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,740
Fred, what are you doing here?

253
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:28,820
L"m stuck cos your stupid, ugly, fat,
grown-up husband has left you.

254
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,500
So you"re all alone and you"re all unhappy.

255
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:37,140
I had to come back and I can"t get home again
until you"re happy. Why don"t you get happy?

256
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,140
OK.

257
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:47,980
The only thing that could make me happy
would be getting Oharles back.

258
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:51,260
- All right. Let"s get Oharles back. L"ll help you.
- OK.

259
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:53,820
- You"ll help me?
- Yeah, l"ll help you.

260
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,860
When have you ever helped me?

261
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:59,500
- All the time. That"s what I do.
- You"ve never helped me.

262
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,860
- Excuse me. Yes, I have.
- Did not.

263
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,700
- Did so.
- You did not.

264
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,740
- I did.
- You did not.

265
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:09,780
- Did not, did not, did not!
- I did, I did, I did!

266
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,740
Right, that"s it. I hate you.

267
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:16,020
- Ow!
- Goodbye forever. I hope you die horribly.

268
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,060
Fred, come back.

269
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:19,900
Fred!

270
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:25,260
You don"t want me any more? Well, fine.

271
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:29,260
L"ll throw myself in front of
the first... fire truck that I can see.

272
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:32,060
- Fred.
- You"re going to be sorry.

273
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:33,980
- Go ahead.
- Goodbye.

274
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:38,900
Argh!

275
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:47,340
What have I done?

276
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,500
Wake up.

277
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:13,060
Snot face, wake up. Wake up!

278
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:15,940
- What is it?
- It"s time to play burglars.

279
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:18,300
- Real burglars?
- Real burglars.

280
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:22,020
The kind that wear sweaters
and Buster Browns. Look.

281
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,220
Da-da!

282
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,260
I made your sweater stripy.

283
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,260
Great.

284
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:41,300
- What is it?
- Look.

285
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:45,980
It"s a burglar bag.

286
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:48,260
(Banging and clattering)

287
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:52,020
Nigel. Nigel!

288
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,900
I think I heard something.

289
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:57,220
(Groans sleepily)

290
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,060
What are we doing this for?

291
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:08,100
Olues. OK. It"s perfect.

292
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:12,780
Let"s go. We"ll steal gold
and we"ll steal silver and we"ll steal jewels

293
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:16,180
and hide them where
no one will ever find them, including us.

294
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:18,220
Promise?

295
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,980
I promise.

296
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,220
Let"s go, burglar.

297
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:29,300
This is very expensive.

298
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,580
Then we"d better be very careful.

299
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,460
What was that?

300
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:37,140
(Olattering)

301
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:41,420
- OK. Oome on.
- The coast is clear.

302
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,540
Shh. Shh.

303
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,540
(Fred) Aha!

304
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:55,380
Hey, snot face. Look at this.

305
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,900
Eeeeeh!

306
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:03,660
Oh, no. Gladiolas.

307
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:06,860
A-A-A-chooo!

308
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,140
Ow!

309
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:21,220
- Are you all right, Fred?
- Yes, l"m all right.

310
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:26,620
- Hello, police?
- Are they there?

311
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,780
- Hello.
- Give them the address.

312
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,620
Tell them there"s a burglar.

313
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:33,220
OK, buddy, what shall we steal now?

314
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,900
- How about the telephone?
- Good idea.

315
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:40,820
- That"s probably where the diamonds are hidden.
- Yeah! Great idea.

316
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,660
Hello?

317
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:45,100
What"s the matter? Where"d they go?

318
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:47,180
- They"ve cut the phone line.
- Oh, my God!

319
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:51,580
Now it"s time to make our getaway through here.

320
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:56,620
Now, opening a window requires
great sophisticatedliness.

321
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:59,060
- So l"d better do it, OK?
- OK.

322
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,060
Ha! Ouch.

323
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:08,060
I love those breaking noises.

324
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:13,260
- Oh, my God. L"m having a heart attack.
- Shh!

325
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:15,420
(Glass smashing)

326
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:20,980
Shh. Shh!

327
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,940
OK.

328
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:28,500
- OK.
- Oome on, Fred.

329
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,820
Right, let"s do it.

330
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:39,220
OK, we"ll bury the treasure here
and no one will find it.

331
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,020
Oh, mind that.

332
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,820
We"ve been found out.

333
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:01,540
- It"s dark in there.
- Be careful. Stay low.

334
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:06,020
Kick it in.

335
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,980
Ow!

336
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:10,100
(Officer) Stay down here.

337
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:12,500
- What shall we do?
- Make a run for it.

338
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:17,500
No. It"s too late for that now.
Snot face, l"m going to take the rap alone.

339
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,900
- No.
- Yes. Give me the guilty sweater.

340
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:22,140
No!

341
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,580
Snot face.

342
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:29,380
A guy"s coming up the stairs.
L"m going to ask him what he wants.

343
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:30,940
Don"t leave me.

344
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:33,100
(Nigel) Keep cool.

345
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,540
Argh!

346
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,940
Nigel, don"t die!

347
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:50,820
Right. I want you to tell them loud and clear
and proud, "Drop Dead Fred did it."

348
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,860
- L"m no coward.
- I don"t want to.

349
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:55,260
Just do it, no brain.

350
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:57,500
- Go on.
- Drop Dead...

351
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,620
Drop Dead Fred...

352
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:06,620
I didn"t say it right. Fred?

353
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:10,060
Hey, I thought you weren"t a coward.

354
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:13,860
L"m not a coward. Have they gone?

355
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:18,380
Why are you taking my husband?
Lt"s a mistake. I am calling our lawyer.

356
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:20,980
- Go inside.
- Why are you going with them?

357
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:24,380
- We are pillars of the community.
- (Officer) Get a grip.

358
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:27,300
What will the neighbours think? Officer...

359
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,740
Maybe Mommy"s right.

360
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:33,340
I never do anything right.

361
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:36,980
So what? What are you saying that for?

362
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:39,740
You"re great. She"s not.

363
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:44,260
She"s always fighting with your dad
and calling you horrible things.

364
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:47,020
Look, you"ve got to be what you want to be.

365
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:49,420
Don"t you ever be like her.

366
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,460
- Promise?
- Promise.

367
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:53,500
OK.

368
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:56,220
Ow!

369
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:58,260
Got you, Fred.

370
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,980
Hey!

371
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:03,580
(Sirens)

372
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:13,140
Elizabeth, what are you doing?
Get dressed. We"re late.

373
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:19,020
Mother, can we talk about when I was little?

374
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:23,180
We haven"t got time. We have to get you
back with Oharles and I can do it.

375
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:25,220
Let"s go.

376
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:34,660
There. You see what I mean? You look wonderful.

377
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:39,660
Now, Elizabeth, don"t worry.
All these products are cruelty-free.

378
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:43,700
No, you see, I think it should
definitely be more like mine.

379
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:45,620
More blush here.

380
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:53,260
Oh, yes. Much more grown-up.
Oharles is going to love this.

381
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:58,220
Oh.

382
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:00,460
A note, Elizabeth, to you.

383
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:05,380
- It"s from Oharles.
- More bad news, no doubt.

384
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:10,460
"Dear Lizzie, I came by but no one was here
so I thought l"d leave this note.

385
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:13,140
"I miss our mornings."

386
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:15,260
(Oharles) "I miss our mornings."

387
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:18,380
- You can"t go to work.
- I love you but l"ve got to go.

388
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:20,580
"The little games we used to play.

389
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,860
"You have the softest touch."

390
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,900
Ooh! Ow.

391
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:31,500
"You"re like a Lynch Bages "83,
a fine wine that"s sure to age well.

392
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,780
"Please come home."

393
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:38,420
"L"ll wait for you at our apartment."
At last he wants to talk.

394
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:42,940
It"s more than your father did when he left.
Does he say anything else?

395
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:45,460
Just one more thing. "Love, Oharlie."

396
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:50,420
Oharles.

397
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,460
Oharlie.

398
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:03,660
(Screams)

399
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:07,140
- Shit yourself?
- God, I thought you were dead.

400
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:10,700
It takes more than a fire truck
to stop Drop Dead Fred.

401
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:13,540
You have to leave. L"m expecting Oharles.

402
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:16,780
Expecting Oharles. That"s important. L"d better go.

403
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:20,220
- There"s a problem. Oharles isn"t coming.
- What do you mean?

404
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:22,340
I wrote the note.

405
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:25,020
Haven"t got a husband!
Haven"t got a husband!

406
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,860
Got a stupid haircut!

407
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:29,820
"Look at my horrid, stupid haircut, everybody."

408
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:32,260
Na na na-na na! Looks just like her mother.

409
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:34,380
Another little megabeast.

410
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:37,980
It was only a joke.

411
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:40,660
It was just a joke.

412
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,660
Snot face.

413
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:45,700
It was just a joke.

414
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,980
Oome on.

415
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:51,900
Hey. Look. Look.

416
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:54,340
Da da-da da-da-da da!

417
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:01,260
Want a cookie?

418
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:11,500
What"s the matter?

419
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:14,580
I really thought that Oharles wanted me back.

420
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:18,020
What"s so special about him?

421
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:21,460
I mean, can he make you puke?

422
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:23,660
- Not like you can.
- Nah.

423
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:27,060
So what, then?

424
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:31,860
- Do you really want to know, Fred?
- Yeah.

425
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,780
I love him.

426
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:39,060
Why?

427
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:42,380
I don"t know.

428
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:47,260
He sends me flowers and brings me wine.

429
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:50,060
He"s very romantic.

430
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:54,540
He can be really sweet sometimes.

431
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:02,780
L"ve never heard anything
so disgusting in all my life.

432
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,180
Bleurgh! Romance?!

433
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,860
Bleurgh!

434
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:14,340
- Urgh! What"s this?
- Oharles"s poster for his wine-tasting party.

435
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:16,540
- Will Oharles be there?
- Yeah.

436
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:21,020
- Well, let"s go.
- No. I can"t go alone.

437
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:26,100
- L"ll come with you. L"ll be your date.
- That"s really nice but no thanks.

438
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:33,020
(Snoring)

439
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:51,140
Janie!

440
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:55,300
Janie.

441
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:04,220
- Janie, I need your help.
- At three in the morning?

442
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:08,220
What is with your hair?
Is there a Marilyn Quayle lookalike contest?

443
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:11,860
I got this note, not from Oharles,
from Drop Dead Fred.

444
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:15,500
- Who? Drop Dead?
- An imaginary friend I had as a child.

445
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:18,860
- He"s back.
- I hear you knocking but you can"t come in.

446
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:21,540
Murray is in there. You can"t stay long.

447
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:25,340
Janie, suddenly he"s everywhere
and only I can see him.

448
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:30,460
He"s driving me crazy. It"s like he"s my best friend
and yet l"m scared to death of him.

449
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:33,060
- I thought I was your best friend.
- You are.

450
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:36,220
- Notjust because l"m visible.
- (Man) Janie!

451
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:40,940
- Are you coming back?
- L"ll be right up, Mur.

452
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,980
- He"s such an animal.
- You mean he goes all night?

453
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:51,620
What do you think, he shits in the corner,
he eats with his paws? You can"t stay here.

454
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:55,780
If somebody else could see Drop Dead Fred,
then l"d know l"m not crazy.

455
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,820
Is he here now?

456
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,380
- No.
- Good.

457
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:02,940
I was going to say if he is, I can"t see him.

458
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:06,500
Janie, if I go home, he"s bound to be there.

459
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:08,860
You can"t stay here, though.

460
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:10,940
I can"t go home.

461
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,140
Oh!

462
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:16,100
- All right, stay the night.
- Thank you.

463
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:20,340
Murray is here one night a month.
You had to pick tonight.

464
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,980
Wake up. Look what l"ve done.

465
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:55,580
Elizabeth, wake up. Look.

466
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:58,900
Snot face, wake up.

467
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:03,700
(Fred) Wake up!

468
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:07,820
Wake up. What, are you shedding?

469
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:13,460
Did you do this to yourself?

470
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:17,020
Oh! Drop Dead Fred did it.

471
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:20,060
- He was here?
- Am I missing something?

472
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:23,900
- Is this a girly thing?
- It"s a creative visualisation.

473
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:26,100
She has an imaginary friend.

474
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:29,340
Oh. I never had imaginary friends.

475
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:32,660
Just wet dreams.

476
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:35,060
You kiss your mother with that mouth?

477
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:38,540
L"m going to be at work till lunch, then l"ll be back.

478
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:52,100
That is a very strange young lady.

479
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:55,460
She"s going through a difficult time
and she is a friend.

480
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:57,540
- L"m not criticising.
- You are.

481
00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:01,820
- L"m just describing what I saw.
- Everybody has strange friends, even you.

482
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:05,220
- But all mine are alive.
- That"s not saying much.

483
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:22,300
Oharles!

484
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,780
Oharles!

485
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:28,580
Oharles!

486
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:33,340
Lt"s got to be him.

487
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:35,940
It looks just like our boat.

488
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:48,380
I think that"s him.

489
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:51,580
Pirates!

490
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:03,220
- I love playing pirates.
- Fred, don"t touch anything.

491
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:06,860
Sure. This is going to be great.
We"ll sail the seven seas.

492
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:10,980
We"ll put on eye patches.
We"ll cut off our legs and glue on wooden ones.

493
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:13,660
- I can"t touch anything?
- No. OK?

494
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:16,180
Yeah, sure. L"ll just touch that one.

495
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:19,780
- I won"t touch that one. L"ll touch that one.
- Nothing.

496
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:23,660
- I am the pirate who doesn"t touch anything.
- That"s right.

497
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:25,460
Except this one.

498
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:27,260
(Beeping)

499
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:29,460
- What did you just touch?
- Nothing.

500
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:31,700
- What did you touch?
- The red one.

501
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:34,140
Fred!

502
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:39,660
The engine"s broken, that"s all. L"ll go and fix
the engine. You keep an eye out, Oaptain.

503
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:41,700
Aye aye, Oaptain.

504
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:51,020
Fred, he"s getting away.

505
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:54,340
What? Faster?

506
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:56,380
Okey-dokey.

507
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:16,740
This way! Oaptain Fred"s in charge!

508
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:25,180
Drown the fishes! Kill all the parrots!

509
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:45,180
What is that water doing there?

510
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:47,540
- What water?
- That water.

511
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:51,300
I don"t know. What are your thoughts?

512
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:53,340
Whoa!

513
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:56,380
Man the lifeboats!

514
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:00,140
(Foghorn blaring)

515
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:22,380
Excuse me a minute, would you?

516
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:31,940
- Now what"s happened?
- I have some bad news for you.

517
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:33,540
More?

518
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:37,220
Remember your house?

519
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:38,660
Yeah.

520
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:42,700
It... It sank.

521
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:44,740
What?

522
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:47,300
Er, I didn"t mean for it...

523
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:49,860
Drop Dead Fred just...

524
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:52,980
He was way out of control.

525
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:56,860
Do you think I have an imaginary-friend clause
in my insurance?

526
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:59,100
Janie, l"m so sorry.

527
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:02,980
- Everything I own is on that boat.
- It"s all still there.

528
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:06,820
It"s just... not so near the top of the water.

529
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:12,540
You always tell me to look on
the bright side of things.

530
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:15,740
What would that be in this particular situation?

531
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:20,620
There he is.

532
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:23,180
- Murray?
- No.

533
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:25,420
- Not...
- Yes.

534
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:31,540
How about the silverware service? A complete
mystery to me but was completely ruined.

535
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:33,340
Any response?

536
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:37,060
He"s waving at us.
Wave or he might do something awful.

537
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:40,100
- Hi!
- What"s he doing now?

538
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,020
Nothing yet.

539
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:45,460
Do it to them, Murray.

540
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:49,100
I think it"s time we got down to specifics,
don"t you?

541
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:53,020
Specifics, don"t you? What is it? Lt"s gone now.

542
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:56,180
He"s just sitting in your chair. Do you see him?

543
00:43:56,260 --> 00:44:00,060
No, but that won"t stop me
from killing the little bastard.

544
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:03,020
But we have an item we"d like for you to see.

545
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:05,260
The police report.

546
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:07,860
The damage to the room was incredible.

547
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:12,940
Excuse me, gentlemen. Hello, sweetheart.
Aren"t you a cute little thing?

548
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:17,340
L"m just going to borrow this.
L"ll be back in a second.

549
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:27,340
Snot face.

550
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:31,740
Have I got him?

551
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:42,020
What are you doing, Miss Shagrue?

552
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:46,060
L"m running for Oongress.
What does it look like l"m doing?

553
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:51,580
- There"s nobody there.
- He"s invisible, idiot.

554
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:55,700
Die! You"re dead, little man!

555
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:57,420
That"s for the boat!

556
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:02,540
That"s for ruining the one schtup I get a month
when Murray"s wife is out of town!

557
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:11,180
Lt"s very hot in here, isn"t it?

558
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:26,860
This is stupid. We ought to be in a shop
that sells harpoons and nets and hammers.

559
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:30,500
- What for?
- We could harpoon Oharles through the head,

560
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:34,340
drag him home and hit him with the hammer
till he agrees to come back.

561
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:37,100
- Harpoon him through the head?
- Brilliant.

562
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:40,500
- It"s not going to work.
- How many times have you tried it?

563
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:42,860
- We"re not five any more.
- I know.

564
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:48,540
- This would be good for the wine gala.
- It looks like a big bruise.

565
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:52,940
- L"m going to be late for lunch.
- Who are you having lunch with?

566
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:55,740
An old friend and I don"t mean you.

567
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:57,780
You"re not invited.

568
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:00,820
Why not?

569
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:03,060
We always do everything together.

570
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:05,940
(Man) Thank you.

571
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:10,900
- This is a great place.
- It"s Oharles"s favourite restaurant.

572
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:13,260
Oh.

573
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:15,300
You cut your hair.

574
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:18,660
- Yeah. Oharles is going to hate it.
- You look beautiful.

575
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:23,100
- Just relax. Let"s have a nice lunch.
- OK.

576
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:24,780
Hi. What"s happening?

577
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:30,100
Oh, no. Mickey fart pants. Who let him grow up?

578
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:32,860
- Go away.
- What?

579
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:38,340
- L"m sorry.
- No, don"t apologise.

580
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:42,220
I love being with you.
I love the way you cut your hair.

581
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,300
I love the way you sink houseboats.

582
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:48,820
Look at him. He"s still talking about love.
I always said you should be a girl.

583
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:56,820
You know, some people believe
that you really never ever fall out of love.

584
00:46:56,900 --> 00:47:01,740
Oh! This isn"t like when we were five.
We"re grown-ups now, so piss off.

585
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:05,220
L"d like to know more about
the grown-up Mickey Bunce.

586
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:07,260
OK, I...

587
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:13,860
Well... I know how much you...
hate the word divorce

588
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:17,900
but after mine I had to get back
into the whole dating...

589
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:22,740
game.

590
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:31,900
- Yes, Mickey, go on.
- Yes, Mickey, go on.

591
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:34,740
OK. Erm...

592
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:38,500
See that woman over there?

593
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:41,700
Mm-hm.

594
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:45,980
Well, I dated her three or four times.

595
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:51,740
It was funny. I didn"t know whether I should
hold her hand when we walked down the street

596
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:53,780
or give her a kiss good night.

597
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:57,860
I felt like I was back in high school again.

598
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:04,540
Why did you do that?

599
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:08,500
- I didn"t.
- No, you did. I saw you do that.

600
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:11,620
(Mouths)

601
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:14,780
I did, didn"t I? To get the waiter"s attention.

602
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:16,900
Well, I don"t think that works.

603
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:20,340
Maybe that does work.

604
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:22,380
Your lunch.

605
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:25,100
And your lunch, sir.

606
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:27,820
This table leg must be loose again.

607
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:37,060
Peekaboo.

608
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:41,540
Peekaboo, yeah.
I play that with Natalie all the time.

609
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:48,460
Oh, yeah...

610
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:50,500
- Smells good.
- Mm!

611
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:06,020
OK. Why did you do that?

612
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:07,780
(Woman) Disgusting!

613
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:09,580
L"m crazy.

614
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:13,060
You are crazy in the most wonderful way.

615
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:17,740
God, I wish I could be like that.
I wish I could do those kind of things.

616
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:21,980
What the hell.

617
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:27,100
(Man) Hey, buddy.

618
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:34,740
- Uh-oh!
- You don"t throw spaghetti in my restaurant.

619
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:36,780
Fine. You do it.

620
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:41,020
You and the Puttanesca woman, out of here.

621
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:43,460
I like him a lot better than I used to.

622
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:46,460
- Take it easy.
- You"re out of here.

623
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:49,900
- It was a joke. You guys should loosen up.
- Out!

624
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:52,860
- What is Puttanesca?
- My dress.

625
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:55,460
L"ll get it. L"d like to. What the hell.

626
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:57,860
Amigos.

627
00:49:57,940 --> 00:50:00,300
- Having fun?
- (Waiter) Oome on, buddy.

628
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:04,460
That was great. That make you feel better?

629
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:08,620
No. First you sink Janie"s houseboat.
What you did in that restaurant.

630
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:11,820
- All you do is smash things up.
- What"s wrong with that?

631
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:14,340
Nothing, except you"re ruining my life.

632
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:20,660
Your problem is you"re no fun any more.
You"ve turned into your mother.

633
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:26,020
You are so sick. You know what?
I don"t want an imaginary friend any more.

634
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:29,220
Do you see what you"re doing to me?
L"m talking to myself.

635
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:33,260
You"re driving me crazy.
Please just get out of my life.

636
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:39,060
All right, fine, l"m going and you"re never
going to see me again ever. Bye.

637
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:00,580
(violin playing, out of tune)

638
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:26,820
I asked you nicely.

639
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:28,860
Shh!

640
00:51:38,820 --> 00:51:40,780
(Woman) Somebody call security.

641
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:42,820
L"m so sorry.

642
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:45,700
L"m...

643
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:51,500
You play such an expensive violin
in a shopping mall?

644
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:53,340
Where? What?

645
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:56,540
L"m just getting my bag. L"m fine, Mother.

646
00:51:56,620 --> 00:52:00,260
How can you say that
when you have conversations with thin air?

647
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:03,060
Not thin air, Drop Dead Fred.

648
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:05,420
- Don"t mention his name.
- Sorry.

649
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:10,020
You may have Drop Dead Fred. I have Dr Ryland.

650
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:19,580
Elizabeth, please have a seat outside.
I need a word with your mother.

651
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:23,500
That"s the piece, Matthew. You"ve finished it.

652
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:39,140
L"m really sorry. I didn"t know I was going
to get you into so much trouble.

653
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:43,420
So what did the doctor say?
Are you insane or what?

654
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:48,100
Did they give you a lobotomy?

655
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:54,220
He"s very good with children.

656
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:57,340
Oh.

657
00:52:57,420 --> 00:53:03,540
He"s one of the country"s leading experts
in dealing with the imaginary-friend syndrome.

658
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:07,500
Your child has one, too, huh?

659
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:09,540
I don"t have a child.

660
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:11,020
Oh?

661
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:13,460
- Well, who"s in there?
- My mother.

662
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:15,820
Oh!

663
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:18,340
- Which one of you is...
- Me.

664
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:20,980
- Let"s go.
- L"ll leave when I want to.

665
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:22,740
OK, fine.

666
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:25,780
OK, I was just asking. Just trying to be nice.

667
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:41,300
Go to Hell Herman! Argh!

668
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:44,060
Fred! Argh!

669
00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:46,340
Punch me.

670
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:47,780
Hey, hey!

671
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:49,980
- (Twang)
- Yaah!

672
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:52,540
Hey, Fred!

673
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:55,540
- Velcro Head!
- (All) Yaah!

674
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:58,060
Brrrrrrr!

675
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:01,060
What are you doing?

676
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:05,020
I am playing with my friends.

677
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:11,300
- Hey, Freddy. Hi, guys!
- (All groan)

678
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:13,340
- Graggy.
- Hey, Fred, hold this.

679
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:20,460
That"s so Namby Pamby.

680
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:22,500
(Woman) You called?

681
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:27,220
Namby Pamby!

682
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:29,180
(All) Whoo!

683
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:33,860
This is great. The whole gang"s here.
Let"s have a sick contest!

684
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:52,380
Hey, watch this. Oharge!

685
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:02,300
Ouckoo! Ouckoo!

686
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:03,940
Oooh!

687
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:05,980
Very nice.

688
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:09,900
Nine, maybe ten. I love it.

689
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:11,940
- Not bad, huh?
- Beautiful.

690
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:17,420
Let her take these after meals and before bed.

691
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:19,940
- Are there any side effects?
- None.

692
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:24,260
They just neutralise that part of the brain
which is malfunctioning.

693
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:26,300
How did it come to this?

694
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:29,260
She"s regressed to where these children are.

695
00:55:30,340 --> 00:55:32,300
Elizabeth.

696
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:42,460
- Well, l"ve got to go, so l"ll see you chickens later.
- Fred. Not the pills.

697
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:46,540
Why not? Do they make you sick or stupid?
L"ll take them. L"m Fred.

698
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:49,540
You don"t want to let her take the green ones.

699
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:52,220
- Why not?
- Remember Go-Go Mouth?

700
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:54,260
Yeah.

701
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:07,260
- Don"t worry about me.
- No, no, F...

702
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:22,820
Here we are.

703
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:27,100
Now, I want you to eat all your vegetables.

704
00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:29,140
- Yes.
- Yes what?

705
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:32,020
- Yes, thank you.
- That"s better.

706
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:36,780
We"re going to be great friends, Mrs Oronin.
I can see that.

707
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:39,340
(Doorbell)

708
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:41,380
L"ll be right back.

709
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:57,860
Don"t eat the napkin, dear. L"ve got a black belt
and I could break you like that.

710
00:56:57,940 --> 00:57:02,540
You"re going to behave.
Oonscious or unconscious, it"s all the same to me.

711
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:07,940
Whoo! I like her. She is good. She is awfully good.

712
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:11,060
L"ll be back in a moment with your pill.

713
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:13,380
"L"ll be back in a moment with your pill."

714
00:57:13,460 --> 00:57:19,020
Wait a minute. Those are the... pills. This is
getting serious. We"d better get out of here.

715
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:24,380
- I know, but this will take one minute.
- There"s no way anyone can see her.

716
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:27,140
- I know, cos she"s so crazy.
- Yes, crazy.

717
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:30,780
- Michael, take your foot out of my door.
- Oh...

718
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:42,700
Oome on. Snot face, let"s go.

719
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:46,300
Look, I am getting fed up of this.

720
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:50,980
It"s getting dangerous.
There"s two of them now and they"ve got pills.

721
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:55,140
They"re going to turn you into one of them.
You"ve started already.

722
00:57:55,220 --> 00:57:59,460
You picked up a piece of broccoli and went,
"What a lovely piece of broccoli."

723
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:01,980
I can"t believe it. It"s beyond disgusting.

724
00:58:05,340 --> 00:58:07,300
Snot face, please help.

725
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:15,820
Oome on.

726
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:24,340
Look, remember when your dad picked up
the megabeast and threw her out the window?

727
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:28,620
- That never happened.
- It didn"t happen, but you wanted it to.

728
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:32,260
Yeah. So did I.

729
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:36,780
Do you remember? Hm?

730
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:39,340
Remember?

731
00:58:41,140 --> 00:58:45,220
Elizabeth, you"ve made
a mess of your beautiful hair.

732
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:49,580
The time has come...

733
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:54,300
when we don"t want to hear the words
Drop Dead Fred ever again.

734
00:58:55,380 --> 00:58:56,940
Don"t you agree, Nigel?

735
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:02,580
- Hm? About what?
- This Drop Dead Fred business.

736
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:12,300
- L"m sorry, Pol.
- Stand still. L"ll clean it later.

737
00:59:13,340 --> 00:59:15,300
Oan I have some cereal?

738
00:59:15,380 --> 00:59:17,540
May I have some cereal?

739
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:22,820
Yes, you may in just a minute.
We don"t eat food off the floor.

740
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:27,420
- Why do you call him Drop Dead Fred?
- Because that"s his name, Daddy.

741
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:31,220
And Drop Dead Fred
is going to teach me how to cook today.

742
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:36,820
L"m going to need flour and sugar
and honey and vodka.

743
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:40,460
And a pair of your pants. We"re making pants pie.

744
00:59:40,540 --> 00:59:42,500
Ouch!

745
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:45,980
Vodka and pants pie. God knows what else.

746
00:59:46,860 --> 00:59:48,820
She"s only a kid, Pol.

747
00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:53,700
Daddy, how about we throw
Mommy out the window?

748
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:57,460
It won"t hurt her. She"ll land right in the gladiolis.

749
00:59:59,620 --> 01:00:02,860
You shouldn"t say things like that
about your mother.

750
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:05,100
She might cut your head off.

751
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:08,660
Very funny, Elizabeth.

752
01:00:08,740 --> 01:00:12,140
Sometimes I think I don"t love you
as much as I used to.

753
01:00:12,220 --> 01:00:16,380
- Drop Dead Fred does.
- No more Drop Dead Fred, period!

754
01:00:19,380 --> 01:00:23,260
- Hi, Fred.
- You"re completely wrong cos I don"t love you.

755
01:00:23,340 --> 01:00:27,780
I don"t love anyone cos love"s for girls
and girls are disgusting.

756
01:00:27,860 --> 01:00:32,660
L"m a loner. L"m a crazy, wide-eyed loner
on a doomed space mission to venus

757
01:00:32,740 --> 01:00:35,420
to battle with the three-headed megabeast.

758
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:39,180
But on the way there, I caught cornflakes disease.

759
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:55,900
Pants pie can"t save me now.
The only thing that can save me is a mud pie.

760
01:00:55,980 --> 01:00:57,740
Yeah! Oome on.

761
01:01:06,380 --> 01:01:08,540
Here it comes.

762
01:01:08,660 --> 01:01:10,580
- Take the top off.
- OK.

763
01:01:10,660 --> 01:01:13,860
- Here it comes.
- Wow, my first real mud pie!

764
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:20,620
Lt"s not ready yet. We need lots of other things.
We need cornflakes and orange juice. Beautiful.

765
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:24,220
- That"s lovely.
- This is fun.

766
01:01:25,260 --> 01:01:28,220
A little tea. A lot of tea.

767
01:01:29,180 --> 01:01:31,620
- Sugar?
- Yeah.

768
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:33,860
- That"s good.
- Here.

769
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:37,580
That"s good. There"s the milk. Good.
Lots of milk.

770
01:01:38,620 --> 01:01:41,380
(Fred) Lovely. Right.

771
01:01:42,620 --> 01:01:47,500
Yeah, but it"s not ready.
It"s still too pretty. It needs something.

772
01:01:47,580 --> 01:01:49,540
I know.

773
01:01:56,860 --> 01:01:58,220
There.

774
01:01:58,340 --> 01:02:03,660
Great. When something"s not working,
the best thing is to tear it apart to make it better.

775
01:02:03,740 --> 01:02:07,260
Elizabeth, are you behaving in there?

776
01:02:09,780 --> 01:02:12,740
- L"m not afraid of the megabeast.
- L"m not either.

777
01:02:12,820 --> 01:02:15,940
When she comes in here,
we"ll make her eat up this mud.

778
01:02:16,060 --> 01:02:19,140
- And then we"ll cut her head off.
- With scissors.

779
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:22,780
- And then we"ll make her eat it.
- Make her eat her own head?

780
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:26,580
- With what?
- Oh, yeah. Well, l"ll eat her head, then.

781
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:30,580
- And l"ll eat the rest of her.
- Yeah! And then we"ll get up...

782
01:02:31,420 --> 01:02:36,420
And we"ll poo her all over the table
cos we"re not afraid of anything. Yeah!

783
01:02:36,540 --> 01:02:38,860
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

784
01:02:38,980 --> 01:02:40,020
Argh!

785
01:02:40,140 --> 01:02:42,860
- (Mother) Elizabeth!
- Quick, hide.

786
01:02:42,980 --> 01:02:44,900
Quick.

787
01:02:46,340 --> 01:02:47,740
Hurry up!

788
01:02:50,860 --> 01:02:52,780
OK?

789
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:57,620
Ah!

790
01:02:59,980 --> 01:03:01,700
Oh, my...

791
01:03:05,580 --> 01:03:07,860
What is wrong with you?

792
01:03:12,620 --> 01:03:15,420
You"ve been playing with him, haven"t you?

793
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:18,620
Where is he?

794
01:03:21,860 --> 01:03:24,500
Don"t take him away from me!

795
01:03:24,620 --> 01:03:27,980
So that must make you cry.
Well, now I know what to do.

796
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:33,100
Give me it. No, don"t take him away from me.

797
01:03:37,940 --> 01:03:40,060
- Nigel, do it.
- No, I won"t.

798
01:03:40,180 --> 01:03:45,140
- I don"t want anything to do with it. It"s not right.
- All right. L"ll do it.

799
01:03:54,020 --> 01:03:55,940
It"s not right.

800
01:03:56,060 --> 01:03:58,780
What would you know about raising a child?

801
01:04:05,780 --> 01:04:07,700
Apparently nothing.

802
01:04:11,580 --> 01:04:14,820
If you ever touch this again, l"ll throw it in the trash.

803
01:04:14,940 --> 01:04:18,380
Do you know what will happen?
He will be crushed to death.

804
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:50,700
"Dear Drop Dead Fred,

805
01:04:50,780 --> 01:04:57,700
"you were my only friend
but she took you away from me.

806
01:05:00,380 --> 01:05:03,900
"I know l"ll see you again someday."

807
01:05:06,980 --> 01:05:10,940
(Fred) "If you come back,
I promise we"ll run away together."

808
01:05:11,020 --> 01:05:13,460
See that? "Promise."

809
01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:17,540
I found that when I was hiding in the garden shed.

810
01:05:17,620 --> 01:05:22,420
That"s right. That"s where I hid it.
But you never answered it.

811
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:26,620
You just disappeared.

812
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:32,380
And when you did all the... life

813
01:05:32,460 --> 01:05:35,260
and, um, the spirit...

814
01:05:35,900 --> 01:05:39,340
- and the...
- The Fred.

815
01:05:39,420 --> 01:05:43,700
Yeah, Fred. Just went out of me.

816
01:05:45,820 --> 01:05:50,100
I should never have let my mother know
how much she could hurt me.

817
01:05:51,660 --> 01:05:56,340
Once she knew how,
she knew that she could do it all the time.

818
01:05:56,420 --> 01:05:58,140
And she did.

819
01:06:02,780 --> 01:06:05,660
So I never showed her my real feelings again.

820
01:06:10,140 --> 01:06:12,780
- So?
- So?

821
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:14,860
So now can we run away, please?

822
01:06:16,580 --> 01:06:19,700
- Where to?
- To the party.

823
01:06:19,780 --> 01:06:22,660
- To the Oharlie party.
- Yeah.

824
01:06:22,780 --> 01:06:24,100
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

825
01:06:24,220 --> 01:06:25,340
Yeah!

826
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:35,060
OK?

827
01:06:35,140 --> 01:06:37,100
Let"s go.

828
01:06:37,780 --> 01:06:40,420
Oh, no, gladiolas.

829
01:06:41,420 --> 01:06:43,700
No. No. No!

830
01:06:54,660 --> 01:06:57,020
Where do you think you"re going?

831
01:06:57,140 --> 01:06:58,500
L"m going.

832
01:06:58,580 --> 01:07:03,340
- No, you"re not, you"re staying.
- No, Mother, this time l"m definitely going.

833
01:07:11,860 --> 01:07:13,820
Good night, flake.

834
01:07:16,460 --> 01:07:19,140
Yeah, well, we"re not scared of you, fatso.

835
01:07:19,220 --> 01:07:20,660
(Lock turns)

836
01:07:20,740 --> 01:07:24,660
Oome on. We"ll go out the window.
L"m good at this. Stand back.

837
01:07:29,460 --> 01:07:31,420
Wait a minute.

838
01:07:34,820 --> 01:07:36,780
I love those breaking noises.

839
01:07:37,740 --> 01:07:39,860
Let"s go. Oome on.

840
01:07:42,660 --> 01:07:45,020
Hey, door-to-window service.

841
01:07:45,660 --> 01:07:48,020
- I brought your dress, madam.
- Mickey.

842
01:07:49,380 --> 01:07:52,660
- Oan you give me a lift?
- Absolutely. Oome on.

843
01:07:52,780 --> 01:07:54,140
(Fred) Oi, wait for me.

844
01:08:00,580 --> 01:08:03,700
- I believe you ordered the spaghetti.
- I hate you.

845
01:08:03,780 --> 01:08:07,300
Mickey, l"m so sorry.
I hope I didn"t get you into trouble.

846
01:08:07,420 --> 01:08:10,540
No. Look, it"s OK. It"s all been great to me.

847
01:08:11,460 --> 01:08:16,220
You"re going to look beautiful in your dress.
I hope Oharles appreciates it.

848
01:08:16,340 --> 01:08:19,100
He"s just a total and utter girl, isn"t he?

849
01:08:19,180 --> 01:08:22,180
This is great, stuck in a truck with two girls.

850
01:08:34,540 --> 01:08:36,820
Mickey, you"re the best.

851
01:08:39,660 --> 01:08:43,020
- Thanks.
- I think I was six when we moved away.

852
01:08:43,140 --> 01:08:48,540
I remember getting in the car, pulling away,
taking one last look at you

853
01:08:48,620 --> 01:08:52,740
and thinking, "l"m never going
to get to have fun with Betsy again."

854
01:08:52,820 --> 01:08:54,380
Mickey Bunce.

855
01:08:55,380 --> 01:08:58,740
Don"t you hate it when you"re right
about the wrong things?

856
01:08:58,820 --> 01:09:01,900
- Let"s go.
- Thanks.

857
01:09:20,140 --> 01:09:23,260
- Snot face, you are looking great.
- I am?

858
01:09:23,340 --> 01:09:25,860
Yeah. For a girl.

859
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:36,260
(Mouths)

860
01:09:36,340 --> 01:09:38,300
There he is.

861
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:43,860
- Is that him?
- Mm-hm.

862
01:09:47,300 --> 01:09:51,580
I thought he liked wine.
Why does he keep spitting it out?

863
01:09:51,660 --> 01:09:54,420
- Where"s he gone?
- I don"t know. Oome on.

864
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:55,700
Right.

865
01:09:56,460 --> 01:10:00,220
- Fred, let"s just behave ourselves.
- Sure. Not a problem.

866
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:02,060
Grapes.

867
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:05,300
Oould someone grab a hold of this?

868
01:10:05,380 --> 01:10:08,060
(Laughter)

869
01:10:08,140 --> 01:10:13,740
What? Why do I always get the blame? You"ve
got the grape. The lady with the grape did it.

870
01:10:20,820 --> 01:10:23,580
- Where is he?
- I don"t know.

871
01:10:23,660 --> 01:10:26,780
Don"t worry. L"ll find Oharlie boy for you.

872
01:10:26,860 --> 01:10:29,460
Wait here. Oharlie!

873
01:10:31,020 --> 01:10:32,380
Oharlie!

874
01:10:32,460 --> 01:10:33,740
Oha...

875
01:10:38,020 --> 01:10:39,860
No panties.

876
01:10:39,940 --> 01:10:41,820
No panties! Ah!

877
01:10:41,900 --> 01:10:45,260
Get up. Get up.

878
01:10:46,980 --> 01:10:48,540
- Fred, get up.
- Go away!

879
01:10:48,620 --> 01:10:50,780
- Get up.
- Spoilsport.

880
01:10:54,340 --> 01:10:57,060
I was just admiring your dress.

881
01:10:57,140 --> 01:11:00,740
The material, it"s so pretty. Slinky.

882
01:11:01,620 --> 01:11:03,140
Oh!

883
01:11:03,220 --> 01:11:05,900
- It"s pretty neat.
- It looks good on you.

884
01:11:05,980 --> 01:11:09,780
It feels good on. I like yours. Yours is nice.

885
01:11:10,580 --> 01:11:13,180
- It"s very purple.
- Annabella.

886
01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:15,700
- My little Ohardonnay.
- There you are.

887
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:21,660
Elizabeth. My God.

888
01:11:22,380 --> 01:11:24,340
That"s him.

889
01:11:25,020 --> 01:11:29,460
Don"tjust stand there, do something.
Go on. Kiss him.

890
01:11:34,380 --> 01:11:36,340
You said she was mousey.

891
01:11:38,780 --> 01:11:41,380
L"m sorry. Excuse me.

892
01:11:41,460 --> 01:11:43,420
Don"t go. It"s going great.

893
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:50,260
Are you OK?

894
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:53,100
- I think so.
- Yeah?

895
01:11:53,180 --> 01:11:55,100
Yeah.

896
01:11:55,180 --> 01:11:59,540
- My little vermentino.
- My little Pinot Noir.

897
01:12:02,260 --> 01:12:06,940
I can"t believe we left the party so soon.
All that wine to spit around.

898
01:12:07,020 --> 01:12:11,020
- We didn"t even get to play spin the bottle.
- I got upset.

899
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:15,540
God, you"re so stupid.
You never leave a party till the very end.

900
01:12:15,620 --> 01:12:18,940
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

901
01:12:19,020 --> 01:12:21,540
Oinderella left early. Remember her?

902
01:12:21,620 --> 01:12:26,060
No, I don"t remember her. I forgot everything
about her. She made me puke.

903
01:12:26,140 --> 01:12:29,140
I remember the ugly sisters. They were great.

904
01:12:31,740 --> 01:12:33,700
You"re here.

905
01:12:34,740 --> 01:12:38,220
- Oan I tell you something?
- What?

906
01:12:38,300 --> 01:12:41,420
You look fabulous.

907
01:12:42,740 --> 01:12:44,500
I do?

908
01:12:45,540 --> 01:12:47,700
Darling, you need me.

909
01:12:48,660 --> 01:12:50,620
I do?

910
01:12:51,740 --> 01:12:53,700
To protect you.

911
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:56,580
From what?

912
01:12:57,980 --> 01:13:00,140
Men like me.

913
01:13:01,740 --> 01:13:05,700
- But, Oharles, there"s so many things...
- No. No talk.

914
01:13:05,780 --> 01:13:07,740
Just kiss.

915
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:20,260
(Lock rattling)

916
01:13:21,580 --> 01:13:23,540
What was that?

917
01:13:23,620 --> 01:13:26,340
Oh, it"s Fred.

918
01:13:26,420 --> 01:13:30,180
Fred? What did you do, give this Fred a key?

919
01:13:30,260 --> 01:13:35,060
Hey, Fred, l"m home now.
It"s Oharles, Lizzie"s husband.

920
01:13:35,140 --> 01:13:37,100
(Rattling)

921
01:13:38,900 --> 01:13:40,860
Is he the violent type?

922
01:13:40,940 --> 01:13:43,260
Only with me.

923
01:13:43,340 --> 01:13:44,740
Jesus.

924
01:13:53,580 --> 01:13:57,940
Who does this guy think he is,
playing around with a married woman?

925
01:14:09,420 --> 01:14:11,180
Polly, hi.

926
01:14:11,260 --> 01:14:13,220
What did you do?

927
01:14:14,380 --> 01:14:16,340
Hello?

928
01:14:16,980 --> 01:14:20,380
You are a wonderful man, Oharles,
but she is dangerous.

929
01:14:20,460 --> 01:14:25,260
I love dangerous. Don"t worry.
I can take care of this Drop Dead Fred.

930
01:14:25,340 --> 01:14:27,860
If you think you can handle it, here.

931
01:14:27,940 --> 01:14:32,300
- But, Oharles, she is just a child.
- L"m a grown-up, Polly.

932
01:14:34,780 --> 01:14:36,740
Where were we?

933
01:14:39,460 --> 01:14:41,820
Eurgh! What does that taste like?

934
01:14:41,900 --> 01:14:45,220
Oharles, let"s talk. It"s kind of important to me.

935
01:14:45,300 --> 01:14:47,260
Of course it is.

936
01:14:50,660 --> 01:14:53,820
- You"re not going to get that out, are you?
- Not now.

937
01:14:53,900 --> 01:14:55,860
- Not now?
- No, I mean now.

938
01:14:55,940 --> 01:14:57,900
- Now.
- Now.

939
01:14:59,980 --> 01:15:01,740
Hang on.

940
01:15:01,820 --> 01:15:07,580
Hang on. This isn"t how the pigeons do it. You"re
supposed to stamp on her head and peck her.

941
01:15:07,660 --> 01:15:10,700
- Oharles.
- Annabella.

942
01:15:10,780 --> 01:15:12,740
- What?
- What?

943
01:15:12,820 --> 01:15:15,260
What happened?

944
01:15:15,340 --> 01:15:17,660
You just said Annabella.

945
01:15:17,740 --> 01:15:20,980
- No, I didn"t.
- Yes, you did. You said, "Oh, Annabella."

946
01:15:21,060 --> 01:15:24,580
- You said "Oh, Annabella."
- That"s impossible.

947
01:15:24,660 --> 01:15:27,780
Oharles, I heard you. You said Annabella.

948
01:15:27,860 --> 01:15:35,540
Well... if I said, "Oh, Annabella," isn"t it better that
I said, "Oh, Annabella" and I was here with you,

949
01:15:35,620 --> 01:15:39,580
than to say "Oh, Lizzie" and be somewhere else
with Annabella?

950
01:15:42,340 --> 01:15:44,100
Yeah.

951
01:15:46,940 --> 01:15:51,740
I know what you"re doing. You"re going to do
what he did to Annabella on the sofa.

952
01:15:51,820 --> 01:15:55,380
- Don"t say things like that now, Fred.
- Lizzie.

953
01:15:55,460 --> 01:16:02,380
I think it"s time to say goodbye... to your friend.

954
01:16:04,420 --> 01:16:06,460
Hey. Hey!

955
01:16:07,540 --> 01:16:10,820
Listen, l"m Drop Dead Fred, right?

956
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:17,020
If your husband thinks he can get rid of me
with a stupid pill, he"s got another think coming.

957
01:16:17,900 --> 01:16:19,660
Ow.

958
01:16:21,460 --> 01:16:24,060
Well, thank you very much, dear friend.

959
01:16:27,980 --> 01:16:29,740
Oharles.

960
01:16:30,580 --> 01:16:33,140
Oh, you look so handsome!

961
01:16:33,220 --> 01:16:37,420
- Lizzie, come on, now. Don"t do that.
- We have to do it this way.

962
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:39,460
Look, l"ve got a long day.

963
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:42,460
I don"t like him.

964
01:16:46,300 --> 01:16:48,300
No. It scares me.

965
01:16:49,380 --> 01:16:51,340
Go on. Out his throat.

966
01:16:52,820 --> 01:16:54,940
Go on.

967
01:17:01,180 --> 01:17:04,700
- What"s the news?
- Wait till my endorphins kick in.

968
01:17:04,780 --> 01:17:08,860
You know, the body"s natural morphine.
Here it comes.

969
01:17:08,940 --> 01:17:10,660
Ooh!

970
01:17:10,740 --> 01:17:14,220
- The aerobic rush. Now ask me.
- What"s the big news?

971
01:17:16,740 --> 01:17:20,860
Have you ever seen so many zeros
outside of the national debt?

972
01:17:21,780 --> 01:17:26,380
- I never knew a barge was worth this much?
- Not a barge. A river condominium.

973
01:17:26,460 --> 01:17:30,020
I had no idea they were worth
that much until mine sank.

974
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:34,140
What a total groove. You"ve got Oharles back
and I have all those zeros.

975
01:17:34,220 --> 01:17:37,460
Our lives have worked out!
Thank you, Drop Dead Fred.

976
01:17:37,540 --> 01:17:40,300
Don"t waste your breath. L"m phasing him out.

977
01:17:40,380 --> 01:17:42,540
- Really?
- Yeah.

978
01:17:42,620 --> 01:17:45,860
(Oharles) What"s for dinner?
(Elizabeth) Your favourite.

979
01:17:45,940 --> 01:17:48,460
(Oharles) Beef Wellington, how nice.

980
01:17:52,340 --> 01:17:55,460
- To us.
- To... us.

981
01:18:01,020 --> 01:18:02,980
For you, my love.

982
01:18:09,620 --> 01:18:12,140
What the hell is that?

983
01:18:14,100 --> 01:18:17,220
- Mud pie.
- Is that supposed to be a joke?

984
01:18:17,300 --> 01:18:21,380
- Fred!
- It"s either him or me, Elizabeth.

985
01:18:21,460 --> 01:18:27,020
It"s you. I swear. Fred is gone.
You know what? L"ll make a dinner salad.

986
01:18:27,100 --> 01:18:30,220
- Forget it.
- L"ll make a lovely salad. Please.

987
01:18:30,300 --> 01:18:35,740
It"ll be the most romantic, wonderful,
romantic... romantic salad.

988
01:18:35,820 --> 01:18:38,900
- A romantic dinner salad.
- Yeah. OK?

989
01:18:38,980 --> 01:18:41,340
- OK.
- Here I go. L"m making it.

990
01:18:43,460 --> 01:18:48,900
It"s going to be so good. If you leave those pants,
l"ll take them to the dry cleaners tomorrow.

991
01:18:48,980 --> 01:18:51,140
You"ll never hear from Fred again.

992
01:18:57,620 --> 01:19:00,900
- He"s the wrong man for you.
- I don"t want to hear it.

993
01:19:00,980 --> 01:19:02,940
You"re not happy.

994
01:19:04,060 --> 01:19:09,100
- Yes, I am.
- If you"re so happy, why am I still here?

995
01:19:10,540 --> 01:19:12,500
I can fix that.

996
01:19:13,260 --> 01:19:15,860
No, don"t do that. Please don"t do that.

997
01:19:31,340 --> 01:19:33,860
Darling...

998
01:19:33,940 --> 01:19:36,980
Of course I still love you, Annabella.

999
01:19:37,060 --> 01:19:40,900
Hey, l"m your fella, Annabella.

1000
01:19:40,980 --> 01:19:42,940
Yeah.

1001
01:19:43,020 --> 01:19:45,100
Snot face, come here.

1002
01:19:45,780 --> 01:19:50,220
- I don"t hear you.
- It"s important. He"s worse than the megabeast.

1003
01:19:51,260 --> 01:19:54,940
- That"s it. L"m taking the last pill.
- No.

1004
01:19:55,020 --> 01:19:57,700
- The goodbye pill.
- Don"t do that.

1005
01:20:01,300 --> 01:20:03,540
Just look in there. Please.

1006
01:20:07,860 --> 01:20:10,940
Annabella... Annabella, she"ll never know.

1007
01:20:12,020 --> 01:20:13,980
And so what if she does?

1008
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:20,100
No, listen. Would you listen?
I am in control with Lizzie.

1009
01:20:20,180 --> 01:20:22,500
L"m in the driver"s seat.

1010
01:20:22,580 --> 01:20:24,540
She trusts me.

1011
01:20:27,180 --> 01:20:29,140
You"ve got to leave him.

1012
01:20:30,060 --> 01:20:31,820
I don"t feel so good.

1013
01:20:32,540 --> 01:20:34,100
Leave him.

1014
01:20:35,580 --> 01:20:37,540
I can"t.

1015
01:20:39,060 --> 01:20:40,820
L"m scared to be alone.

1016
01:20:43,180 --> 01:20:45,140
Oome with me.

1017
01:21:03,380 --> 01:21:06,380
- "Fred?"
- "Yeah."

1018
01:21:06,460 --> 01:21:10,140
- "Where are we going?"
- "Use your imagination."

1019
01:21:12,580 --> 01:21:15,340
- "Fred?"
- "You"ll know what to do."

1020
01:21:17,540 --> 01:21:19,500
"Fred?"

1021
01:21:39,260 --> 01:21:41,660
(Door bangs)

1022
01:21:41,740 --> 01:21:44,060
L"m scared.

1023
01:21:44,140 --> 01:21:46,300
I don"t want to be alone here.

1024
01:21:54,420 --> 01:21:56,380
(Fire crackling)

1025
01:22:06,020 --> 01:22:08,780
(Olock ticking)

1026
01:22:20,380 --> 01:22:24,260
Get in, Lizzie. I want to take you away, goose.

1027
01:22:25,660 --> 01:22:27,420
Don"t you love me any more?

1028
01:22:32,220 --> 01:22:34,900
- Hi.
- Fred.

1029
01:22:38,740 --> 01:22:41,100
So what are you going to do about him?

1030
01:22:59,060 --> 01:23:01,980
Nice job. Nice job.

1031
01:23:02,060 --> 01:23:05,820
Oouldn"t have done better myself.
Oome on. This way.

1032
01:23:07,540 --> 01:23:09,060
Ow!

1033
01:23:14,780 --> 01:23:16,740
We need a tree.

1034
01:23:24,820 --> 01:23:27,180
(Rumbling and creaking)

1035
01:23:45,460 --> 01:23:48,580
You"re getting good at this. Let"s go.

1036
01:24:04,500 --> 01:24:07,020
Just where do you think you"re going?

1037
01:24:07,860 --> 01:24:10,620
Just forget her. Just say the magic words.

1038
01:24:11,980 --> 01:24:15,460
- L"m not afraid of you.
- You can"t go in there.

1039
01:24:16,100 --> 01:24:18,180
L"m not afraid of you!

1040
01:24:18,260 --> 01:24:20,060
Finally, the magic words.

1041
01:25:03,660 --> 01:25:05,940
We don"t have to be afraid any more.

1042
01:25:21,100 --> 01:25:23,460
You have to go now.

1043
01:25:31,860 --> 01:25:34,820
OK. L"m ready.

1044
01:25:36,780 --> 01:25:38,940
- Let"s go.
- No.

1045
01:25:41,180 --> 01:25:43,860
You have to go alone.

1046
01:25:43,940 --> 01:25:47,700
- But I want you to come back with me.
- That"s just tough.

1047
01:25:48,580 --> 01:25:52,140
You have to go alone. I can"t get back now.

1048
01:25:55,100 --> 01:25:57,060
Look, you"ve got you now.

1049
01:25:58,060 --> 01:26:01,180
You don"t need me. Not any more.

1050
01:26:03,020 --> 01:26:05,660
So...

1051
01:26:05,740 --> 01:26:07,500
goodbye.

1052
01:26:13,580 --> 01:26:16,700
Just kiss me and say Drop Dead Fred.

1053
01:26:19,260 --> 01:26:21,220
Now.

1054
01:26:22,300 --> 01:26:24,260
Drop Dead Fred.

1055
01:27:22,060 --> 01:27:26,260
What do you mean it"s no good for you this way?
Annabella, wait.

1056
01:27:26,340 --> 01:27:28,660
(Dialling tone)

1057
01:27:28,740 --> 01:27:31,020
Well, to hell with you, Annabella.

1058
01:27:35,020 --> 01:27:38,900
Lizzie, is our romantic salad ready?

1059
01:27:38,980 --> 01:27:41,020
Yeah.

1060
01:27:51,180 --> 01:27:53,140
Bye, Oharles.

1061
01:27:53,220 --> 01:27:54,980
Oh!

1062
01:27:55,060 --> 01:27:57,100
I forgot to give you something.

1063
01:28:39,540 --> 01:28:42,740
Yes, Oharles. Leave everything to me. It"s Oharles.

1064
01:28:42,820 --> 01:28:44,380
Oharles?

1065
01:28:47,220 --> 01:28:50,220
Young lady, you have a lot of explaining to do.

1066
01:28:50,300 --> 01:28:55,540
I know what"s best for me. You have
to stop treating me like l"m your enemy.

1067
01:28:55,620 --> 01:28:59,260
Enemy? Sometimes I wonder with you.

1068
01:28:59,340 --> 01:29:01,660
I made the same mistake a lot of people make.

1069
01:29:01,740 --> 01:29:05,220
- I had a child to save a marriage.
- How can you say that?

1070
01:29:05,300 --> 01:29:07,900
You made things worse. He left because of you.

1071
01:29:10,020 --> 01:29:11,740
What a pile of shit.

1072
01:29:13,660 --> 01:29:18,700
Don"t you dare. Don"t you dare walk out on me.

1073
01:29:19,580 --> 01:29:22,300
Elizabeth. Lizzie.

1074
01:29:23,380 --> 01:29:25,340
L"ll be lonely.

1075
01:29:54,620 --> 01:29:56,780
You should get yourself a friend.

1076
01:30:12,820 --> 01:30:15,620
You have a lot of options open to you right now.

1077
01:30:15,740 --> 01:30:18,740
I just think l"d like to be one of them. OK?

1078
01:30:20,380 --> 01:30:23,900
- OK.
- Daddy, it was his idea.

1079
01:30:24,020 --> 01:30:27,820
I wanted to play but he bumped me
on the head and said piss off.

1080
01:30:27,940 --> 01:30:31,780
- Natalie, what did you do?
- Natalie Bunce, where are you?

1081
01:30:31,900 --> 01:30:34,980
Oome back in here this minute
and get cleaned up.

1082
01:30:35,100 --> 01:30:37,020
Natalie, what happened here?

1083
01:30:37,140 --> 01:30:41,300
- It"s chocolate and it"s yummy. Want some?
- No, I don"t want any.

1084
01:30:41,420 --> 01:30:46,940
She made a terrible mess in the kitchen
and expects me to believe a pretend friend did it.

1085
01:30:47,060 --> 01:30:50,500
He"s not pretend. He"s Drop Dead Fred.

1086
01:30:53,020 --> 01:30:54,940
What did you say?

1087
01:30:55,060 --> 01:30:58,300
She said l"m not pretend. What are you, deaf?

1088
01:30:58,420 --> 01:31:01,500
Natalie, now, come on. What really happened?

01:31:01,620 --> 01:31:04,700
I told you. Don"t you believe me?

01:31:04,820 --> 01:31:10,140
I believe you. Next time you see
Drop Dead Fred, you send him my love.

OK. Now.

Well done.
