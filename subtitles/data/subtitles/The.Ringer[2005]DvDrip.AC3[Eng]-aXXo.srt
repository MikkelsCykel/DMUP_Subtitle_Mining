<i>Chapter 4. You're a disgrace.</i>

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,100
<i>You're wasting my oxygen.
Get off your butt and do something.</i>

4
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,000
<i>Hey, you, stop looking
at the people around you.</i>

5
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,200
<i>I'm talking to you,
the loser who bought this tape.</i>

6
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,400
<i>I've had bowel movements
with more spine than you.</i>

7
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,300
<i>Do you like coming in second place?</i>

8
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,900
<i>Well, I don't.
And from now on, neither do you.</i>

9
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:56,300
<i>Starting today, you're a winner,
and you can do it. Got it?</i>

10
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:56,400
<i>I'm a winner.</i>

11
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,000
<i>Say it like you mean it, you little Judy.</i>

12
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,300
I am a winner.

13
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,400
I'm a winner.
I can do it.

14
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,700
I'm a winner. I can do it.

15
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,500
I'm a winner.
I can do it.

16
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,600
I'm a winner. I can do it.

17
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:20,800
I'm a winner.

18
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,900
<i>Ow!</i>

19
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,400
Sir, I've been with this company
two and a half years now...

20
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,300
and all I've really done
is some clerical work.

21
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,000
<i>And, uh, I think I'm ready
for some more responsibility.</i>

22
00:01:41,199 --> 00:01:41,800
<i>Okay, Barker.</i>

23
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:46,600
Well, what kind of responsibility
are you looking for?

24
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,900
Look, I don't know, sir.

25
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,700
I just... feel that
I'm being underutilized here...

26
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,100
and I can handle a hell of a lot more
than what I've been given.

27
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm just looking for the chance.

28
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,700
You know what, Barker?
Maybe you're right.

29
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,800
<i>Let's do it.
Why not?</i>

30
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,100
Let's move you upstairs,
see how you do.

31
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,200
<i>Give you a chance.</i>

32
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:11,500
Wow, thank you. Thank you very much.

33
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,600
Uh-huh.

34
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,900
Yeah. Yeah.
Put him through. I gotta take this.

35
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,800
- Oh.
- Hello, Bull. Yeah, hang on.

36
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:23,500
Uh, yeah, wait, Barker.

37
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,900
Uh, do me a favor, will you,
and fire Stavi.

38
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,200
The janitor?

39
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:32,000
Yeah. Hang on.
Yeah, he's doin' a terrible job.

40
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,300
But he's a really nice guy. I mean,
can't you give him a second chance?

41
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,600
<i>I caught him using
my personal bathroom.</i>

42
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,100
<i>I sat on his pee.</i>

43
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,800
See you.
Yeah.

44
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:50,200
<i>Yeah, tell him to be on time.
I'm tired of teeing off late.</i>

45
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:50,400
<i>Stavi.</i>

46
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,300
<i>Stavi.</i>

47
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Oh, hello, Mr. Stevie.

48
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:03,100
Did you get
the Christmas card I sent you?

49
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,300
Yeah.

50
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,200
Hey, listen.
I wanna talk to you for a second.

51
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,400
Stavi, you don't like your job, do you?

52
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,500
Oh, yes.
I like very much.

53
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,700
I get to clean things.

54
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:17,800
Work with my hands.

55
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,200
Yeah, but you'd be happier
doing something else.

56
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,000
I mean, you're a pretty bright guy.

57
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,000
No. Not really.

58
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,900
<i>Of course you are, Stavi. You got
a little bit of a language problem, but-</i>

59
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,400
No, no.

60
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,200
In my country,
Stavi not too bright either.

61
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,400
Look, trust me,
you're wasting your time here.

62
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,500
Oh, no.

63
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,100
Oh, no.

64
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,200
Oh, no.

65
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,900
Stavi can't be fired.

66
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,300
I have five kids.

67
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,600
My wife, Betya-
She died.

68
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,700
Oh, God. I'm sorry.

69
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,900
Stavi love her...

70
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,600
from the depth...

71
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,600
of his soul.

72
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,400
- Hey, I'm not firing you.
- No?

73
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:28,200
No, I'm offering you something else-
a better job.

74
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,800
Stavi listening.

75
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,200
Would you like to mow the lawn
at my apartment complex?

76
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,500
I can do lawns.
How much I get?

77
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,000
How much you get here?

78
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,200
350 a week.

79
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,700
I can match it.

80
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,400
Tempting.

81
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,800
But...

82
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,900
I have so many memories here.

83
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,600
Four hundred?

84
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,900
And health benefits?

85
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,100
I can't really swing health benefits.

86
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,900
Please, Mr. Stevie.

87
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,100
I need health benefits.

88
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,300
I have big family.

89
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,600
You got 'em.

90
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:16,200
Come on.

91
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,400
Ew.

92
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,700
It's okay. It's not that big of a deal.

93
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:58,000
Somebody help me!
I got a bag of fingers here! Shh!

94
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,900
<i>My fingers!</i>

95
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,300
Keep it elevated.

96
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,400
- Nurse!
- Excuse me, sir. I can help you.

97
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,000
Who's Mr. Simicek's employer?

98
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,600
- Me.
- I'm Dr. Ahmed...

99
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,000
head of reconstructive surgical group.

100
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Uh, good news.
We can save his fingers.

101
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,900
- Thank you.
- Just a few questions-

102
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,300
What health plan is he on?

103
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,600
It doesn't say here anything.

104
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,200
Uh...

105
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,700
he's not on one yet.

106
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,200
He's not on an HMO?

107
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,300
How about Medicaid?

108
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,800
He doesn't have it.
He's not a citizen.

109
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,800
Ooh!
Well, in that case...

110
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,300
you will need to cover
the cost of the surgery up front.

111
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,300
Well, how much is it?

112
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,000
$28,000,
not including the anesthesia.

113
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,400
I don't have that kind of money.

114
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:04,000
Well, I'm sorry, sir. As much as
I'd like to help, I can't do the surgery.

115
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,000
- What?
- Look, you don't have insurance.

116
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,400
You don't have any funds.

117
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:12,400
There's no way my hospital
can absorb that kind of risk.

118
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:14,500
How long do I have
to raise the money?

119
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:20,400
Well, if I put the fingers on ice,
they can last for a couple of weeks.

120
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,300
After that, it's not doable.

121
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,900
I'm sorry, sir.

122
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,100
But, Doc.

123
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:41,100
<i>Come on, Krysinszi. Make this field goal.</i>

124
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,600
Dear God, if he puts it
through the uprights...

125
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,300
I promise, no more massages
with happy endings.

126
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,600
Here's the kick.

127
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,900
Oh, thank you, God!
I put out to you, you dump on me.

128
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,600
Yo.

129
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,200
Uncle Gary, it's Steve.

130
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,000
Hey... shitbird.

131
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,200
Look, I hate to bother you,
but, uh...

132
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,100
I was calling you
about that, uh...

133
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,100
1,500 I loaned you
a couple years ago.

134
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,000
Loan?
I thought it was a gift.

135
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,500
No.
That was definitely a loan.

136
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,400
- I already paid you.
- No, you didn't.

137
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,600
What do you need 1,500 for?
You got a job.

138
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,500
Well, actually, uh, I need 28 grand.

139
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,300
28 grand? What did you do,
knock up a cheerleading squad?

140
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,000
It's just a stupid thing.
My friend got his fingers cut off, and-

141
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,400
Listen, I'd really like to
help you out with this 1,500...

142
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,000
but, you know,
you got me at a bad time now.

143
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,700
Shit. Gotta go.

144
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,700
Don't do-

145
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,800
You owe me $40,000...

146
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,000
which I, as a friend, took
your word that you would pay.

147
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,200
- And you haven't.
- I will, Michael. I will. I promise.

148
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,100
I've got something working now.
I promise-

149
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,500
You know something?
You talk too much.

150
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,300
<i> A lot of people say
one thing we don't have today is heroes.</i>

151
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,500
Hey, Michael.
That guy you like's on TV.

152
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,300
His name is Jimmy Washington...

153
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,800
<i>but to those who follow
Special Olympics...</i>

154
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,300
he's known by one simple word-
champion.

155
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:13,100
You see, Jimmy has won
the last six Special Olympics pentathlons.

156
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Incredible.

157
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,800
That guy's
the Deion Sanders of retards.

158
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:24,300
<i>I like to run
and train hard for events...</i>

159
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,100
and get to show I can do anything.

160
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,800
When people tell me I'm good...

161
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,700
I feel good.

162
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,800
I feel like a happy person.

163
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,400
I feel just like all of you.

164
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,600
I love that kid.

165
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,100
Hmm?

166
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,300
<i>Who is it?</i>

167
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,700
<i>It's Paris Hilton.</i>

168
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,300
You have intimacy problems.
You know that?

169
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
- What do you want?
- I don't want anything. I want to help you.

170
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,100
I don't have any pot.

171
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,400
I don't want pot!
I've got good news for you.

172
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:31,400
You said you had
money problems, right?

173
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,700
<i>- Right.
- Well, so do I, but it's all gonna be over.</i>

174
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,700
Wanna know how?

175
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,500
How?

176
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:44,900
We are gonna fix
the Special Olympics.

177
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:45,600
Hmm?

178
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,300
Special Olympics.
We're gonna rig it.

179
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,800
You and me.

180
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,700
You want to fix
the Special Olympics?

181
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,400
You know what, Uncle Gary?
I'm gonna get you a little coffee.

182
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,700
I'm not that drunk.
There's this kid Jimmy.

183
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,600
Wins all the time.
No one can beat him, right? Wrong! You can.

184
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,500
<i>- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about you.</i>

185
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,800
You ran track in high school.
You were state champion.

186
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,000
- Division D champion.
- Whatever!

187
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:22,100
You were a great athlete, and you were
the best kid in your drama class every year.

188
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:22,900
I was so proud of you.
I kept a scrapbook.

189
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,500
- No, you didn't.
- In my heart, I did.

190
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,100
<i>You were a great actor.
You were the best.</i>

191
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,600
You could imitate anybody.
Your Diana Ross- a riot.

192
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,500
We all thought you'd end up
in Hollywood bangin' starlets by now.

193
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,500
Well, that dream didn't work out
too good, now, did it?

194
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,100
Look, sit.
Listen to your uncle.

195
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,200
The preliminaries
are being held here in three days.

196
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,600
All you have to do
is act like one of them.

197
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,900
Not exactly a major stretch for you.

198
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,700
We get you in, you get into the nationals,
I bet 100 on you, we clean up...

199
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,100
your friend gets his fingers back.

200
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,800
Who's gonna take that bet?
Vegas?

201
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,300
I know someone who will.

202
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,200
<i>- No. I can't.
- Aw, come on.</i>

203
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,400
A normal guy against
a bunch of feebs?

204
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,300
You'll look like
Carl freakin' Lewis out there.

205
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:15,900
I am not fixing the Special Olympics.
It's wrong!

206
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,700
- Hello.
- I'll tell you what's wrong.

207
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,500
Your friend Stavi won't have any
health benefits. That's what's wrong!

208
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,500
- Look, I wanna help, but-
- But what?

209
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:32,300
The guy's wife is dead. You think a guy
with no fingers is gonna find another woman?

210
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,300
Even worse, when he comes home by himself,
he won't even be able to jerk off properly...

211
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,700
because you robbed
that man of his dignity!

212
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:43,600
Look, get it through your head.
I am not fixing the Special Olympics.

213
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:45,800
Hi, guys.

214
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:52,700
Hi.

215
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,900
- Hello.
- Hi.

216
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,200
- How you feelin'?
- Not too bad, Mr. Stevie.

217
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,900
Were you able to straighten out
the insurance glitch?

218
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,700
Yeah, it's, uh,
comin' along really good.

219
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,900
It's okay if you don't get insurance.

220
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,100
<i>Stavi don't need all his fingers.</i>

221
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,800
No, you need 'em, Stavi.

222
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,600
No, No, it's okay.
I look on my bright side.

223
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:20,200
With not so many fingers, when I do
the gardening, I don't crush the flowers.

224
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,300
I can pick them easy.

225
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
God always have a plan.

226
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:29,400
Look, I promise you
I'm gonna get your fingers back for you.

227
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,800
You're a good man, Mr. Stevie.

228
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,900
<i>Uh-uh, Stavi Three.
Not a hugger.</i>

229
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:39,800
Mm-mm.

230
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:44,400
Children, give Mr. Stevie
a Stavi good-bye.

231
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,200
Bye, Stavi.

232
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,800
Poor Stavi. He trusted you.
He believed in you.

233
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,100
He literally gave you
his hand in friendship.

234
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,000
Did you know that man's dream
was to play the flamenco guitar?

235
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,400
Okay.

236
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I'll rig the Special Olympics.

237
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:13,100
Thank you.
Finally, a little humanity.

238
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,900
It doesn't take
a smart man to know what love is.

239
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,200
I love you, Jenny.

240
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,600
Okay, now you try.

241
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,400
Try what?

242
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,600
Acting like that.

243
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:33,100
Come on, man.
Start taking this seriously.

244
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,200
Okay.

245
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,400
I love you, Jenny.

246
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,700
Hey, hey!
Commit.

247
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:48,700
<i>- I love you, Jenny.
- Better. Better.</i>

248
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,800
Something's missing.

249
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,800
You should drool.

250
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:57,300
Okay, Uncle Gary.
There you go. Good night.

251
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,500
Exciting.
Isn't it exciting?

252
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,700
- What?
- You're acting again.

253
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,400
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!

254
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:08,000
We gotta come up with a slogan.

255
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,700
A slogan, you know, like, uh,
"Life is like a box of chocolates."

256
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,700
<i>Or, "Take my hands, boss,"
like that monster tard from The Green Mile.</i>

257
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,900
"Monster tard"?
What's wrong with you?

258
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,600
What? Since when did "tard"
become politically incorrect?

259
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,700
Good night, Uncle Gary.

260
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,300
I'm going to hell.

261
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:31,000
My name is Lance,
and I like nuts.

262
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,300
My name is Arthel,
and I can count to potato.

263
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:39,000
Hi, my name is Jerome.
Can I have a slice of your doodie?

264
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:53,800
Hello, my name is Jeffy,
and I like to eat apples.

265
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,600
Boogie-woogie.

266
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,200
Whoo-hoo!

267
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,700
<i>You take care of work like I told you?</i>

268
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,800
<i>Yeah, I got two weeks off.</i>

269
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:25,100
<i>- I told them my Uncle Gary just died.
- Oh, that's sweet.</i>

270
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:30,000
<i>Come on, now.
Let's not be antisocial.</i>

271
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,500
Hi!
My name is Glen.

272
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,200
Guess how many fingers I have.

273
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
- Ten.
- No. No. No.

274
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,100
I have eight fingers,
and I have two thumbs.

275
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,900
- Oh, that's good. An oldie, but good. Come on.
- Guess what! Guess what!

276
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:02,900
- What?
- I work at Burger King.

277
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,800
Do you want fries with that?

278
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,600
What's your name?

279
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Uh, Steve. Uh, Jeffy.

280
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,200
J-Jeffy.

281
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,500
You talk funny.

282
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,800
That's 'cause he's Canadian.
Come on.

283
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,300
Hey, you know who else is Canadian?
Bill Shatner.

284
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,500
- That's right. Keep walkin'.
- Yeah, T.J. Hooker.

285
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,400
And Jim Carrey, the sad clown.

286
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,600
And Alan Thicke-
Never got him.

287
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:28,500
And also Dave Thomas-
Not the Wendy's guy, but the other one.

288
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,500
And Alanis Morissette.
She has issues.

289
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,800
Hi! My name's Glen.

290
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,300
<i>Oh, God, this is wrong.</i>

291
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,200
- Oh, calm down.
- This is so wrong.

292
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,600
Will you calm down?

293
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,000
Look, I can't do this.

294
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,500
- You have to. Come on.
- No. Don't make me do this.

295
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,700
- Come on.
- No. No.

296
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,200
Oh!

297
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:56,800
<i>Oh! Oh!
Are you all right?</i>

298
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,900
You didn't hurt yourself, did you?

299
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,500
<i>- No.
- Are you all right?</i>

300
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,000
<i>- Yes.
- You sure? Need a hand up?</i>

301
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,200
You need a hand up?

302
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,600
No! Hey!

303
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,900
Hurt? Hey! No!

304
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,600
You're gonna take just a minute.
You're fine?

305
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,300
Oh, you got some schmutz on you.

306
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,000
I'm Lynn.
What's your name?

307
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,600
- I'm-
- What's the matter, cat got your tongue?

308
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,300
His name's Jeffy.
He's just a little shy.

309
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,000
I mean, you know how they are.
God bless 'em.

310
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,700
Cat got my tongue.
Cat got my- Cat got my tongue!

311
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,700
Yeah, it's a really stupid expression.

312
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:41,400
It sounds like a bad Dr. Seuss title.

313
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,300
Are you his guardian?

314
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,500
Yeah. Yeah.

315
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,300
It's tough, but, you know, someone's
gotta feed him, change his underwear...

316
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,400
show him how to play
with his puppets.

317
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:58,700
- Yeah. Do you have his medical release forms?
- Huh?

318
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:02,900
Well, we require medical release forms
for all the athletes.

319
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:04,900
Paper's at home.

320
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,600
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.

321
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,200
- I got all that stuff. It's at home.
- Oh.

322
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,500
Sorry.
I swear...

323
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,900
sometimes I think I'm the one
who should be wearin' the helmet to bed.

324
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,300
<i>Please. Please.</i>

325
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Don't let the little guy suffer
because of my mistake.

326
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,100
I mean, look at him.
Look at him.

327
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,200
He's got his heart set on competing.
Don't you, Jeffy?

328
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,200
Go for gold!

329
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,400
Ha ha ! Go for gold !

330
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
All right.

331
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,100
I'll let it slide for now.

332
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,600
Jeffy, do you wanna grab a POWERade
or a granola bar or something?

333
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,700
- I just need to talk to your guardian.
- Be a good boy, okay?

334
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,500
<i>To place him
in the appropriate events...</i>

335
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,000
I'm just gonna need to know
his qualifying times and his diagnosis.

336
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,000
Well, he's slow.
Real slow.

337
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:51,600
Uh, Jeffy want a V-8.

338
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,200
Okay.

339
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:59,700
You should see him trying to
eat a watermelon.

340
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,300
Uh, I'm sorry.
I mean his medical diagnosis.

341
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,900
Well, you know, Lynn...

342
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,300
technically,
I'm not a doctor, but...

343
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,100
<i>it's a huge Latin word.</i>

344
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:14,000
Uh, "Symptomus Moronicus."
Uh-

345
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,400
Jeffy highly functioning
developmentally disabled.

346
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:21,100
All right! Nice, Jeffy.
Good for you!

347
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,400
All right. Well, let's just go sign in,
shall we?

348
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,600
Good-bye, Uncle Gary.

349
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,800
- Very nice, Troy. Very nice, Rudy.
- I think I got it.

350
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,100
- Good job, you guys.
- Hey, Lynn.

351
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,300
- Hey, you stayin' out of trouble, Winston?
- No.

352
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,500
Yeah. Come on over this way.

353
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,900
We're going to this room over here.

354
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:58,400
Let's see if Billy is in.

355
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,800
Hey, Billy,
your roommate is finally here.

356
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,300
Hi.

357
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,300
Lynn, a man wants to see you.

358
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:12,600
Oh, thank you. Okay.
Well, I'll just let you two get acquainted.

359
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,000
My name's Jeffy.

360
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:30,900
So, you workin'
on the computer there?

361
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,900
No, I'm walking my dog.

362
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,400
Oh.

363
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,100
"Kids of Widney High."

364
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,900
<i>What are they,
like 'N Sync or something?</i>

365
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,400
Oh!

366
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,400
Scratch!

367
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,800
Scratch!

368
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:59,600
Oh, my stars!
For the love of Liza!

369
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,700
You scratched my CD!

370
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,500
<i>Why'd you scratch his CD?</i>

371
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,000
Uh, Jeffy just admiring it.

372
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,200
<i>Do it again,
and you'll be admiring my butt...</i>

373
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,500
<i>from the pavement with a straw.</i>

374
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,500
- What?
- You heard me.

375
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,500
Thanks, Mark.

376
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,800
Asshole.

377
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,500
Billy, Jeffy sorry...

378
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:37,500
<i>about the whole CD incident.</i>

379
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,600
You scratched my CD, you know.

380
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,000
I know, and I'm really sorry.

381
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,500
You scratched it.

382
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:48,100
You picked it up in clear daylight
and you scratched it.

383
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:51,200
I know. You know,
we've established that.

384
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,600
Hey, don't give me 'tude.

385
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,300
You scratched my CD, Tex.

386
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:01,300
Billy, if you'll listen to me,
I'm clearly not disputing that.

387
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:05,900
<i>- I'm just trying to apologize.
- Tut, tut, tut. Bye-bye.</i>

388
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
That's my chair.

389
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,300
Come on! Get up, get up, get up!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

390
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,600
<i>So there are five events
in the pentathlon.</i>

391
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:32,400
We're gonna try you out in each of them
so we can assess your ability...

392
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,600
and see which athletes
to put you with at the games.

393
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,800
- Can I be with Jimmy?
- Pardon?

394
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:39,100
Jimmy from TV.
Jeffy big fan.

395
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:42,100
You can be with Jimmy
as long as you finish in the top eight.

396
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,700
But hey, if you don't,
I'll still love you.

397
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,500
Okay, so here is
the 100-meter dash...

398
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,400
and this is your first event,
so good luck.

399
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,200
Jeffy, the race.

400
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,700
- Jeffy forgot.
- All right.

401
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,200
Well, go for it.
Good luck.

402
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:13,100
<i>On your mark!
Set!</i>

403
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:18,700
- Good luck.
- I don't need luck, ugly. Rudy beat your butt!

404
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:47,800
<i> Runners, line up
for the last race of the day-</i>

405
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,400
<i>the 400-meter dash...</i>

406
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:52,400
<i>which will determine the final divisions.</i>

407
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,600
What are you doin'?
What are you doin'?

408
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,500
<i>Oh! There you go!
Oh! Oh! Go, go, go, go!</i>

409
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,000
Great job, Jeffy.
You finished eighth in the competition.

410
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,000
You get to go to the finals with Jimmy.

411
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,500
I'm very proud of you.

412
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,000
I'm very proud of you.

413
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,700
- Good thinkin', pal.
- Huh?

414
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,800
Holdin' back and lettin'
seven others beat you.

415
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,800
Nice touch.

416
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:39,900
- You wanna bet on the Special Olympics?
- Why not? It's sports.

417
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,200
Get this piece of crap out of here.

418
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,800
Look, look, look.
I owe you 40 grand, right?

419
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:50,900
Well, a hundred grand says that Jimmy
is not gonna win the next Special Olympics.

420
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,300
Can you believe this guy?

421
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,900
He can't come up with my 40 G's...

422
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,000
and now wants to bet a hundred G's.

423
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,200
I'll put up my house.

424
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,500
- You have a home?
- Yeah. Under the freeway.

425
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:07,500
Let me get this straight.
You wanna bet against the great Jimmy?

426
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,100
- Uh-huh.
- You know something?

427
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,600
You're sick.
You need help.

428
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:17,200
But I'll tell you what.
Before you get help, I'll take your house.

429
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:21,400
Come on, athletes!
Only eight days to go till the games.

430
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:23,800
Let's go! Come on.
I wanna see you beat those entry scores.

431
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:27,900
Two more laps.
Let's go, guys. Like a champion.

432
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,900
<i>Come on now!
Move it out!</i>

433
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:37,600
Hi!

434
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,600
My name is Thomas.
What's your name?

435
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:43,300
Jeffy.

436
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,600
Um, tomorrow,
I gonna talk to Karen.

437
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,400
She's a real good swimmer,
and she can jump high too.

438
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:54,900
Um, and, um,
did I tell you I got a watch?

439
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:59,600
My aunt sent it to me.
Not my aunt Helen, my aunt Ruth.

440
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:02,000
And, um, when I talk to Karen...

441
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:06,400
should I wear my shirt up,
like this, or down?

442
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:06,800
Or-Or up?

443
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,400
Or possibly...

444
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,400
tucked in?

445
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,800
I don't know, man.
Wear it like you're wearin' it. You look great.

446
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:23,200
What's that?

447
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,700
It's Jimmy!

448
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,200
Jimmy!

449
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,700
Can I have an autograph please?

450
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,500
- Get it off eBay.
- Who is eBay?

451
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,100
<i>How much until you guys
are really happy?</i>

452
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,200
Sorry.

453
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,500
Ignore.
He has issues.

454
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,600
- My name is Glen.
- Yeah.

455
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,500
- Hey, guess how many fingers I have.
- Eight.

456
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,800
<i>There you go. Next.</i>

457
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,000
Wow.

458
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,800
These days always so brutal?

459
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,500
Good catchin' up with you.

460
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:58,700
Hi, Sally.
Looking very hot today.

461
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,300
Is that a new hairnet?

462
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:06,000
Oh, Mylanta.
You are my woman.

463
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:07,900
She's nice.

464
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,000
I once met a girl speed dating.

465
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:15,900
We almost went out
for a whole minute.

466
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,100
This is my Doberman, Candy.

467
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:20,300
He usually doesn't bite me...

468
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,500
only sometimes,
although, he does.

469
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:32,000
Uh, Glen, could you pass
the ketchup please?

470
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,300
Uh-huh.

471
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,800
Glen, can you pass the ketchup?

472
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,200
Uh-huh.

473
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,300
Yes, I could.

474
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,700
Whoa!

475
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:01,000
<i>You asked if I could
pass the ketchup.</i>

476
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:04,300
You didn't ask if I would!
You didn't ask if I would!

477
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,400
<i>You didn't ask if I would! </i>

478
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:14,400
Guess what! Guess what!
I work at Burger King!

479
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
You mentioned that.

480
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,500
But if you would pass the ketchup,
I would really appreciate it.

481
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,500
You talk different.

482
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,000
What do you mean?

483
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:34,200
- You do talk different.
- Jeffy talks the same.

484
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,200
You talk different
than you did before.

485
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,300
Why do you talk different
than you did before?

486
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:42,500
- Jeffy talks the same.
- No. You talk different than you did.

487
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,500
<i>- Am not!
- Oh, yes you are!</i>

488
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,000
And one time
he talked one way...

489
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:49,500
<i>and now he-
now he talked the other way.</i>

490
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,400
<i>- Exactly!
- Is there a problem, you guys?</i>

491
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:55,600
Jeffy talked different
than he did before!

492
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,800
Jeffy just wanted some ketchup,
and Jeffy wanted an apple, and, uh-

493
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,500
Can I have a hug?

494
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:06,900
- Sure. Sounds the same to me, guys.
- Could have fooled me.

495
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,800
Watch out for this wisenheimer, Jeffy.
He can be trouble.

496
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:43,300
Oh! Remember last year when we
were walking and then you barfed?

497
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,800
That's cause I had spicy clams.

498
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,900
Yeah. And then you didn't
wake me up on time...

499
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,900
<i>so I didn't have lunch,
I had breakfast.</i>

500
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:53,300
You know what?
I'm gonna go say hi. I'll see you later.

501
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,900
Jeffy, want some company?

502
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,600
- Hi.
- Hi.

503
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,800
How's it going?

504
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,700
Uh...

505
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:03,600
guess how many fingers I have.

506
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,500
- Ten?
- No. I got eight, and two thumbs.

507
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,500
Hey, what are you
doing tomorrow?

508
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,100
Uh, nothing.
Uh, why?

509
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:19,600
Well, I thought
maybe you and I could do something.

510
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,900
Me and you?

511
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,700
Yeah, I thought
maybe we could have lunch.

512
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,600
Jeffy could maybe fit you in.

513
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,900
Okay, great.
So I'll see you at 1:00? Okay?

514
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,400
- Yeah.
- Cool. I'll see you.

515
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,100
- Hey, Jeffy.
- Hi, Lynn.

516
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,700
- How are you?
- Good.

517
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:45,200
Good.

518
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,200
I want you to meet my fiancé.

519
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,600
How you doin'?
I'm David Patrick.

520
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,500
- What's your name?
- Jeffy.

521
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,300
Oh, it's Jeffy.
Yeah, Jeffy.

522
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,800
I like Jeffy.
Jeffy's a good name.

523
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,400
What's your last name?

524
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:04,100
Um...

525
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:04,800
Uh-

526
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,900
You must have a last name.

527
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,800
Jeffy, you know your last name.

528
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,900
No. Jeffy mentally challenged.
Remember?

529
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:17,100
I know it. Your uncle wrote it on your forms.
It's Dahmor. Jeffy Dahmor.

530
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:19,700
With an "O."

531
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,700
Oh.

532
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,600
Well, that's great.
Listen, we have some reservations.

533
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,000
- So let's hit the road. Okay, Jeffy?
- Gonna sit in back?

534
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:41,100
I hope you don't mind.
I invited Yolie along.

535
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:44,700
I know how hard it is
to meet new people at these things.

536
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,500
Don't worry.
Just be yourself. It's cool.

537
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:00,100
Hey, Jeffy, did you know
that Yolie is from Seattle?

538
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,200
I hear it rains in Seattle.

539
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:06,000
Sometimes.

540
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,600
<i>I hear they got coffee there too.</i>

541
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:14,100
Yes, they have
all the major beverages.

542
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,600
You know, I heard that.

543
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:20,000
<i>Oh, you know, I heard
a great joke today.</i>

544
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:23,800
This woman took her grandson to the beach,
and while she's snoozing in the sand...

545
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:27,000
this huge wave comes
and sweeps the boy out to sea.

546
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,700
- So he's out there thrashing-
- Honey.

547
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,600
That's not really appropriate.

548
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:35,100
You know what it's like
when you're trying to tell a joke.

549
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:40,200
<i>We'll be through with lunch
by the time she gets to the punch line.</i>

550
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,400
<i>Right?
Hey, I have one.</i>

551
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:45,200
It's really funny,
and it's appropriate for everyone.

552
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:48,800
What time is it
when you have to go to the dentist?

553
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:53,400
Hmm?

554
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,400
"Tooth hurty."

555
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,900
It's a bit of a thinker.

556
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,700
And really, really old.

557
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,700
Hey, can I take your order?

558
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,500
- Oh, uh, why don't you guys go first?
- Yeah, absolutely.

559
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,500
<i>I'll have a salad
and some lime Jell-O.</i>

560
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:14,400
All righty.
And for you?

561
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:17,300
<i>- Um, I'll have the ribs.
- Ribs?</i>

562
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:20,300
Uh, hold on there, cowboy.
That could get kind of messy.

563
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,500
Do you have anything else
that's a little cleaner?

564
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,800
You know, we have
some really good chicken fingers.

565
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,700
No, no, no.
He can handle the ribs. Have the ribs.

566
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,600
Ribs.
I want the ribs.

567
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,100
Ribs.

568
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:39,600
So, I was workin'
in this Baskin-Robbins one summer.

569
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:43,100
Jeffy found a $20 bill in the john.

570
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:46,700
<i>And I was happy.
You know, really happy.</i>

571
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:51,000
'Cause this is the first time
that Jeffy ever caught a break.

572
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:52,900
Here, fishies.

573
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:57,600
But then I came to find out
I had a hole in my pocket.

574
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,700
<i>It was Jeffy's $20 bill.</i>

575
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:07,500
- Yeah, we got that. Excuse me.
Gotta go to the restroom.

576
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,100
Oh, I'll go with you.
You know what they say about us gals.

577
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,900
We always travel in pairs.

578
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,100
Quite a girl, isn't she, Jeffy?

579
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:21,400
Lynn's fantastic.

580
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:24,200
I was actually talking about Yolie.
But thanks, Jeffy.

581
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:30,900
So how is everything?
Looks like you did a number on those ribs there.

582
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,200
- They're delicious.
- How do you all know each other?

583
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:36,400
Oh, he's in Special Olympics.

584
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:37,500
Go on.
Tell her, Jeffy.

585
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,700
I'm in Special Olympics.

586
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,400
That's so sweet of you
to get involved.

587
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,700
See, I admire the hell
out of these guys...

588
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:52,100
all the challenges
they have to overcome.

589
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:55,600
You know, I've been helping
Jeffy here train for years.

590
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,800
<i> You know,
I'd love to do something like that.</i>

591
00:36:55,600 --> 00:37:00,800
- How would I get involved?
- Brandi? Is that your name?

592
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:03,300
<i>- Yeah.
- Brandi. I'd love to do that.</i>

593
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,600
<i>- Give me your number, and I'll hook you up.
- Sure.</i>

594
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,400
I'm sorry it didn't work out
between the two of you.

595
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,000
I know how hard it can be
to make new friends.

596
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,800
That's why I was so glad when I met David.

597
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,200
What? You don't like David?

598
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:24,000
David very nice to Jeffy
when Lynn around.

599
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:25,800
What do you mean?

600
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:29,100
David very nice to Jeffy
when Lynn around.

601
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,700
Well, but how is he
when Lynn's not around?

602
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,600
David poke Jeffy in the chest
and call him stupid.

603
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:38,700
What?

604
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:43,000
Why would-
Why would he poke you?

605
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:47,700
Jeffy's fault.
Jeffy drank Coke wrong and spill on David.

606
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,800
But David very nice to Jeffy
when Lynn around.

607
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,900
Hello, Thomas.

608
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,900
What's goin' on, guys?

609
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:07,100
You are so busted.

610
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:12,100
- You're a faker!
- A mother faker!

611
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:15,300
Jeffy doesn't understand.
Jeffy cocoa for Cuckoo Puffs.

612
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,900
<i>Shut up with that,
you stupid A-S-S.</i>

613
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:21,300
<i>- Yeah, we know you're not special.
- Yeah.</i>

614
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:26,700
- You think you can fool us? "My name is Jeffy."
- Jeffy likes apples.

615
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:27,800
"Can I have a hug?"

616
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,900
I've seen better acting on pornos.

617
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:33,900
<i>- You lay it on too thick.
- Yeah. We do that too...</i>

618
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,200
when we want things.

619
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,700
Show him what you did last year
when Pamela Anderson came to see us.

620
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,400
Hey, not so aggressive.

621
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:45,700
<i>- It took Pamela longer to catch on.
- Yeah.</i>

622
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,800
I'm sorry, guys.

623
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,300
It was wrong of me
to try and fool you.

624
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,600
Duh.

625
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,500
Why would you do
something like that?

626
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:11,100
You got no idea
what kind of pressure I'm under.

627
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,100
What's that mean, Jeffy?

628
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,000
I-

629
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,600
It's not Jeffy,
it's Steve.

630
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:20,000
And it's a long story.

631
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:23,200
<i>What happened was that...</i>

632
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,800
I work with this guy named Stavi...

633
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:29,600
and I was sent to fire him,
and I couldn't.

634
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:36,400
And that's how I got here.

635
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:41,800
- What?
- Do you know what he's talking about?

636
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:47,000
- I'm baffled, Jeffy.
- It's not Jeffy. It's Steve.

637
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,800
Oh!

638
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,700
<i>- He's Steve, not Jeffy.
- Yeah.</i>

639
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:54,000
I thought you said
your name was Stavi.

640
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,800
No.
I'm Steve, not Stavi.

641
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,600
- Just get your story straight.
- Stavi lost his fingers.

642
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:05,600
<i>Does he have insurance?
Medicare, Medicaid or...</i>

643
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,300
Aflac?

644
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:11,700
No, he doesn't have
Medicare, Medicaid or "Aflac."

645
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:12,400
That's why I'm in this position.

646
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,400
Okay, guys.
Let me do this again.

647
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,500
I wanna start from the beginning.

648
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:20,900
Stavi worked for me, all right?
And he lost his fingers.

649
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:23,400
So, in summation-

650
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:26,800
Hey, Rudy, come on.
Stick with me here.

651
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,000
Okay, okay.
Wrap it up.

652
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:32,000
Stavi is the guy
who lost his fingers...

653
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:40,000
and I needed money
so I could get 'em sewn back on.

654
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:42,900
And that's why I, uh, did this.

655
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:43,900
<i>Wow!</i>

656
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,500
Poor Stavi!

657
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,700
Boy, Steve, you really
screwed that guy over.

658
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:55,300
<i>What-
What made you think you could win?</i>

659
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,000
Well, I actually ran track
in high school...

660
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,400
and I was division champion
in the 800 meters.

661
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:09,200
- What was your best time?
- Uh, 2:02, 2:03.

662
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,700
All right, then. I'm gonna be goin'.

663
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,200
Wait.

664
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:23,200
What-
What are you doing?

665
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,400
- I'm packing.
- Why?

666
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:30,600
'Cause you guys are right.
I'm a faker.

667
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,100
We want you to stay.

668
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:40,900
Yeah, right.

669
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,400
We're serious.

670
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:46,600
<i>Yeah.</i>

671
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:50,300
- Yeah, we're sick of Jimmy winning all the time.
- Jimmy's a prick.

672
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:54,500
Oh, God. We're sick and tired
of seeing his mug on TV.

673
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:57,600
<i>Dateline. Wheaties.</i>

674
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:00,300
<i>Yeah, last week,
he was on According to Jim.</i>

675
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,400
<i>Let's be fair.
That was a good episode.</i>

676
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,300
You guys think I can beat him?

677
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:08,400
- I didn't say that.
- Maybe.

678
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,700
But you have to start trying.

679
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:14,300
- I am.
- You're at the top level here.

680
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,000
Yeah.

681
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,600
<i>- Hey, guys.
- Hello, Lynn.</i>

682
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:28,100
- Hi, Lynn.
- Hello.

683
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,200
Listen, I hate to break this up,
but, um...

684
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:32,500
I need to have a talk with Jeffy.

685
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:33,900
Okay.

686
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:41,300
What's this about?

687
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,000
Hi, David.

688
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,600
Hey, Jeffy.

689
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,200
Come on over here.

690
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:52,600
Jeffy, I was a little troubled by our talk,
so I called David-

691
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,800
- This isn't necessary, Lynn.
- It is, honey.

692
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,500
He should learn
not to say hurtful things.

693
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,200
Jeffy, did David really poke you?

694
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:05,100
- No.
- Then why did you say that?

695
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:10,200
Jeffy a small person.

696
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,800
Well, I think you should
apologize to David now.

697
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,100
Honey, he really doesn't have to.

698
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:19,300
Well, only if you want to.

699
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,400
- Jeffy want to.
- Great.

700
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:28,900
- That's very mature of you.
- Absolutely.

701
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Hey! Are you okay?

702
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:36,900
- Jeffy wanna go.
- Okay.

703
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:40,200
I didn't do anything.

704
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:50,200
Get up, Steve.
It's Uncle Glen.

705
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:54,000
Get up!

706
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,400
Oh, it's 3:00 a.m.

707
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,500
<i>Time to practice, butt-face.</i>

708
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,700
Only a week to get you in shape.

709
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:05,200
Come on.
Ten more minutes, guys.

710
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:12,900
Come on, Steve. Run.

711
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:20,700
Oh!

712
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:22,700
<i>If you want a better jump...</i>

713
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,500
you gotta push off your plant foot.

714
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:26,800
Come on, Jeffy.
Push it!

715
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:30,700
<i>Damn!</i>

716
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:32,700
He's gonna be a real project,
isn't he?

717
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:34,600
<i>You can say that again.</i>

718
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:40,600
He's gonna be a real project, isn't he?

719
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:44,700
Whoa!

720
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:56,100
Ah, he stinks out loud.

721
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:58,800
Protein shake.
Drink up.

722
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:08,000
Oh, God!
What was in that?

723
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:11,100
Milk, eggs and meat.

724
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,100
- What kind of meat?
- Raw.

725
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:19,600
<i>Hey!
These are my good shoes!</i>

726
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:20,300
Whoa!

727
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:25,900
Hey, guys,
how's this helping me win the race?

728
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:29,500
You know, he raises a good point.

729
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:32,500
Special Olympics!

730
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,400
Whoa!

731
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,900
How's a blindfold
gonna help me run faster?

732
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,400
Take it off, and I'll show you.

733
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:11,600
Sic him, Killer. Get the bad man.

734
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,900
- Go get him!
- Yeah! Yeah!

735
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
<i>That's a vast improvement.</i>

736
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,800
Ow!

737
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,200
Ha!

738
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:54,200
<i> So this fat-ass floor manager
lady comes up to me...</i>

739
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:55,600
<i>and she looks like
a female Ted Koppel.</i>

740
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,300
She says,
"Well, if you wanna piss your time away...

741
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:01,100
why don't you move your desk
into the urinal?"

742
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,700
Floor manager.

743
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:07,200
I don't understand though.

744
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,000
You been working at that job
for two years, but you hate it?

745
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:13,400
What else am I gonna do?

746
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,600
Well, there's always Kinko's.

747
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:19,300
You must like something, Steve.

748
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:23,400
In high school,
I wanted to be an actor...

749
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:25,600
but, uh, that didn't turn out so hot.

750
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:28,300
- So you went to Hollywood?
- No.

751
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:31,900
He went to Broadway.
Right, Steve?

752
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:36,600
Actually, I didn't
get around to that either.

753
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:38,400
Summer stock.

754
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,400
No.

755
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:46,200
Everyone told me
I wasn't gonna make it anyway though.

756
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:49,700
People tell us all the time
what we won't ever do.

757
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,200
Won't ever read.
Won't ever have a job.

758
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:54,600
Won't ever learn
to tie my own shoes.

759
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:56,400
Won't ever have a girlfriend.

760
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,300
I've done all of those things.

761
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:00,200
But you can't tie your own shoes.

762
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:03,800
- And you never had a girlfriend.
- That's right.

763
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:06,300
But, guys, acting is hard.

764
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,300
You have to remember lines.

765
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:11,300
<i>Let's not kid ourselves.</i>

766
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:14,500
Looks are important in that industry.

767
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,700
<i>It's true.
Very true.</i>

768
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:19,500
I'm sorry.
Somebody had to say it.

769
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:26,900
I mean, you probably wouldn't have
made it, but you could have tried.

770
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,300
<i>You wanna see
some really good acting?</i>

771
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:34,900
<i>- Yeah!
- Oh, yeah. He does Chucky from Child's Play.</i>

772
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:37,700
I'm Chucky. Wanna play?

773
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:39,000
Aaah!

774
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:46,900
This camping is fun!

775
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:49,100
<i>Yeah.</i>

776
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:23,700
- Is that Karen?
- Shh!

777
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:27,000
Don't say her name!
What if she heard you?

778
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,400
I don't want her to know I like her.

779
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:30,700
Then she-

780
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,800
Did you know Christ was a Jew?

781
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:40,100
You should go talk to her.

782
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:43,600
What do I say?

783
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:47,800
I don't know. Uh, I pretty much stink
at that kind of stuff...

784
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:50,900
but just go over there
and say something nice.

785
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:59,500
<i>Oh, no.</i>

786
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:06,400
Hot?

787
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:09,100
What a cockblock.

788
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:10,800
Hi. How are you today?

789
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:15,800
<i>You love Lynn.</i>

790
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:17,100
I do not.

791
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:23,600
<i>Hey, guys. What's happening?
What are you laughing about?</i>

792
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:25,100
- Hello, Lynn.
- Hey, Lynn.

793
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:29,100
So, today's Friday,
uh, the day before Saturday.

794
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:31,900
You got any big plans
for the weekend?

795
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Big plans-
I'm goin' to Costco.

796
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
I got a few things to pick up.

797
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:39,500
- I love Costco. Costco's good.
- I've been there.

798
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:41,300
I love baseball better.

799
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:44,000
Can I help?

800
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,300
Eye contact.

801
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:50,100
Oh.

802
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:52,800
All right.
Yeah.

803
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,200
Yeah. I could use a hand.
Come along. I'll pick you up at 10:00, okay?

804
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,200
<i>All right. Cool.
See you then.</i>

805
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:02,300
- See you guys later.
- Can I come with you, sexy?

806
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:04,400
Smooth move, Ajax.

807
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:11,100
I would definitely bring protection.

808
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:23,800
All right!

809
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:39,600
- Come on, Lynn!
- No, I have a terrible singing voice.

810
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:40,500
Oh, come on!

811
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,100
You're right.
You can't sing.

812
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:59,700
But that's okay.
Jeffy still loves you.

813
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:06,000
Ooh, this cart is too full.

814
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,300
You're something else.

815
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:10,300
- That's Costco.
- Barker?

816
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,300
Hey!
How you doin', man?

817
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:18,100
- I haven't seen you since high school.
- I don't know you.

818
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:20,400
Wow! Looks like
you're doin' okay though.

819
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:24,500
- I think you're confusing him with someone, sir.
- No, no. Dude, come on.

820
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:26,800
- It's Peter. Peter Conway.
- Peter's another name for wiener.

821
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:30,600
- Yes!
- No, sir, seriously. You're mixing him up.

822
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:33,600
You said that same stuff
in high school, dude! That's fantastic!

823
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:36,400
- I don't know you! I don't know you!
- No, no, no, Jeffy!

824
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,800
Please, stop!
Will you just walk away, sir?

825
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:42,000
- Oh, my God!
- Just walk away! Walk away!

826
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:47,400
Dude, you've got to call me!
That is classic!

827
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:49,400
Oh, man!

828
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,300
You want another gallon of mustard?

829
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:58,900
No, thanks. I'm still pretty full
from the jug of relish.

830
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:02,400
Jeffy likes taking
long trips with Lynn.

831
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:04,500
Yeah, me too, Jeffy.

832
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:11,100
- Who's that?
- Oh, that's my big brother, Jeremy.

833
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:15,300
He was special.
Just like you.

834
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:21,700
Is he competing this year?

835
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:26,700
Well, he-
he died a few years ago.

836
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:31,200
But I think you guys
would have been great friends.

837
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:54,200
Father, I've been
doing something bad.

838
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:55,800
Really bad.

839
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:00,500
I'm a terrible person.

840
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:02,500
<i>There are no terrible people.</i>

841
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:05,000
There are only poor, misguided souls.

842
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:07,800
Now, please, unburden yourself.

843
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:12,200
You see, I was in a real bind, and-

844
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:17,600
I'm sorry, Father.

845
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,400
I can't even say the words.

846
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:23,100
My son,
there is no sin unforgivable...

847
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:25,900
to those that seek redemption.

848
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,900
I've been pretending
to be mentally challenged...

849
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:40,000
so I can fix the Special Olympics...

850
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,900
to make money off of it.

851
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:54,700
Father?

852
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:01,800
Jesus, Father!
Whoa!

853
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:04,600
<i>I'll see you rot in hell!</i>

854
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:07,300
You piece of crap!

855
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,100
<i>Okay, guys, elbows up.</i>

856
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:18,100
Jimmy wouldn't say that.

857
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:21,600
Jim, it's pretty standard-
"I'm going to Disney World!"

858
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,900
- Uh-uh.
- Come on, Jimbo!

859
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:27,400
All the great athletes say that after they win.
Michael Jordan said it.

860
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:29,000
Michael Jordan can kiss my butt.

861
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,700
Write me something new.
Jimmy have to work.

862
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:43,400
<i>100-meter practice! Let's go, guys!</i>

863
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:46,600
<i>Everybody in the 100 meters,
take a lane.</i>

864
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:50,500
<i>- Full speed.
- Hey.</i>

865
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:53,300
Hay is for horses.

866
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:17,600
<i>How the hell can a guy like that
be beatin' ya? It ain't natural.</i>

867
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:20,000
Will you cut it out with that stuff?
These guys are great!

868
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:23,000
- Couple of 'em could be in the regular Olympics.
- Maybe on the French team.

869
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:28,000
Yeah? There's a guy here from the Bahamas
who ran a marathon in two hours and 45 minutes.

870
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,500
That's just propaganda.
One of ours can beat one of theirs.

871
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:33,800
- It's simple physics. You just gotta push a little.
- I am pushing!

872
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,700
Well, push a little harder!

873
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:39,400
Do it for Stavi. Poor bastard's fingers
are thawing as we speak.

874
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:43,900
<i>You know, maybe I should
just accept the fact that I can't win...</i>

875
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:47,000
and stop lying to Lynn
and everybody else.

876
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,200
<i>Hey, hey.
Don't go soft on me.</i>

877
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:51,600
Wait a second!
Wait a second!

878
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,200
This is about a piece of ass, isn't it?

879
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:59,200
Don't call her that.

880
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:00,100
Oh, that's good.

881
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:02,000
You're doing Jeffy now.
Right?

882
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,900
Because you'd have to be a moron
to think she'll fall for you.

883
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:08,300
She thinks you're mentally retarded!

884
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:11,800
<i>Christ. Steve-</i>

885
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:16,800
Steve, if it's love that you want so bad,
if you win, I'll do ya.

886
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:22,000
Let's just face it.
This isn't gonna work.

887
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,200
That's it.
When the goin' gets tough, give up.

888
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:25,400
That's what you're good at.

889
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:30,100
You've got a chance to
change your whole life, Steve.

890
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:32,400
Become a man.
Become a winner.

891
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:35,700
Now, show some backbone.
Dig down deep and go kick that tard's ass.

892
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:39,300
Don't ever say that word to me again!

893
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:43,500
I mean it.
These guys are my friends.

894
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:52,400
- It's on.
- Whoa! Whoa!

895
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:54,900
Whoa!

896
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,900
<i>Suck on that, Billy!</i>

897
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,300
- Blaaah!
- Hey, Winston- Son of a-

898
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:37,100
What happened here?

899
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:39,600
- Pipe broke.
- It's faulty plumbing!

900
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:41,700
- It's snowing.
- I had an accident.

901
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,900
<i>A really big one!</i>

902
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,500
That'd be Mr. Billy Joel in February, 1974...

903
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:04,500
with the "Piano Man."

904
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:07,200
<i>Okay, okay, what's this one?
What's this one?</i>

905
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:14,500
<i>That's Mr. Stevie Wonder
in the summer of 1969...</i>

906
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:15,500
with "My Cherie Amour."

907
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:20,800
- Stupendous.
- Steve, go ahead. Ask me any movie.

908
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:23,200
<i>Um, Jaws.</i>

909
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:25,400
That's a great movie.

910
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:30,400
<i>Well, I guess it's bedtime.</i>

911
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:31,300
<i>Let's do something.</i>

912
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:34,200
Hey, Steve, take us somewhere.

913
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:37,100
Yeah, right.
You guys know we can't go out at night.

914
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:40,500
<i>Ooh! Ooh! I know!
Let's see a movie!</i>

915
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:45,200
Guys, you know we can't leave. Right?
We can't go anywhere.

916
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:47,300
Come on.
Give me a break, Steve.

917
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:49,500
I don't even have a car.

918
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:55,300
You could rent a car. Budget Rent-a-Car.
No drop-off fee whatsoever.

919
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:59,100
Come on, Steve.
We're special. Help us a little.

920
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:00,400
<i>You're gonna play that card?</i>

921
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:05,000
<i>Winston wants a hug.
Winston likes apples.</i>

922
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,500
<i>I believe that's my thing.</i>

923
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:10,200
If you let us go out,
I'll let you go out with my sister.

924
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:12,600
We've been training you for nothing?

925
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:14,900
Oh, come on, Billy.

926
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:18,200
<i>I told you I was
telling the truth, Daddy.</i>

927
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:21,200
I'm sorry I lied to you.

928
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:24,300
I'm not proud of myself.

929
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:29,200
<i>There are a lot of things about me
that aren't what you thought.</i>

930
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:32,300
It's beautiful.

931
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:35,200
There's dancing, and it's dirty.

932
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:39,200
<i>- I love you.
- You're kiddin' me.</i>

933
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:41,400
You guys are actually
buyin' into this.

934
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:45,700
Do you even have a soul?

935
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,600
Oh, Mylanta.

936
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:07,000
Lynn's boyfriend.

937
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,800
Hello, Lynn's boyfriend!

938
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:11,600
- Shh!
- Wait till I tell the fellas!

939
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:14,400
- W-Wait! Wait! Shh!
- You have a girlfriend?

940
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:15,200
Guess what!
Guess what!

941
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:19,300
- I just saw Lynn's boyfriend!
- Where?

942
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:21,000
And he was kissing with a girl.

943
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:23,700
- Ohh!
- Oh, no.

944
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:27,300
- Let's get out of here.
- Yeah. Let's go say hello.

945
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:29,400
How come you didn't tell me
you had a girlfriend?

946
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:32,800
Hi, Lynn's boyfriend
and... not L-Lynn.

947
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:35,400
- She's my cousin.
- No, I'm not his cousin.

948
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:38,200
- Oh. Nice to meet you, Lynn's boyfriend's cousin.
- Is Lynn here?

949
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:41,400
No, she's not here.
But she might come.

950
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:44,700
- Hi, David!
- Hi, David. What did you think of the flick?

951
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:46,900
- What are you guys doing here?
- J-Jeffy's birthday.

952
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:50,200
<i>Never seen Dirty Dancing.
Hello, waitress.</i>

953
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:53,100
- Hi.
- No, that's Lynn's boyfriend's cousin.

954
01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:54,100
No, no. I'm not his cousin.
I'm not your cousin.

955
01:01:54,100 --> 01:01:57,000
- No, not cousin. She's just a buddy.
- "Buddy"?

956
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,800
<i>He was licking his buddy's ears.</i>

957
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:03,100
<i>I wasn't licking her ears.
I was just looking for an earring.</i>

958
01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:04,400
- And she found it.
- Good-bye.

959
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:06,600
Good-bye, hooker lady.

960
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:10,700
Seriously, it's probably...

961
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:14,500
not a good idea
to tell anybody about this.

962
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:16,500
<i>'Cause it'd be a very,
very, very bad thing...</i>

963
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:19,700
<i>if they knew you went off campus
this late at night.</i>

964
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:23,500
I mean, they might not
let you compete in the games.

965
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:25,100
Oh, God.

966
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:28,000
It's okay.

967
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:31,200
Don't worry.
We won't tell anybody.

968
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:35,100
Well, there you go.

969
01:02:35,100 --> 01:02:37,800
I always knew
you were smart, Jeffy.

970
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:42,000
<i>Could you take us home, David?</i>

971
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,800
Oh, well, I- I- I'd like to, but I-

972
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:48,700
Or we could call Lynn
so that we don't get caught.

973
01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:52,400
Oh, what the heck.
I'll swing you guys by on the way home.

974
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:55,000
- Shotgun!
- I'm parked out front.

975
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:59,500
Almost there.
Okay, guys.

976
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:03,300
Oh, you guys!
Where have-

977
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:07,300
David! What the hell?
I have been worried sick!

978
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:11,000
Relax, honey.
I just took 'em to the mall to hang out.

979
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,100
The mall closes at 9:00.
It's 12:00.

980
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:15,500
We stopped off for ice cream.

981
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:19,600
When the fuck
did we get ice cream?

982
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:21,500
Jeffy, I won't be mad.

983
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:24,100
Just tell me the truth.
Where were you guys?

984
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:26,200
<i>Did you get ice cream?</i>

985
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,100
David told Jeffy not to talk...

986
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:32,400
about his pants around his ankles...

987
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:34,800
and the girl looking for her earring.

988
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:39,700
How could you?

989
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:41,200
They're making up stories.

990
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:43,100
It's late for them.
They're delirious.

991
01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:45,000
<i>Was I sleeping?</i>

992
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,100
Kara, Shane,
will you get these guys to their rooms.

993
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:52,100
<i>Come on, Lynn!</i>

994
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:53,600
<i>Can I get that ice cream now?</i>

995
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,900
Hi, everybody, this is Steve Levy...

996
01:03:56,900 --> 01:03:59,600
coming to you from Bobcat Stadium
in beautiful San Marcos, Texas.

997
01:03:59,700 --> 01:04:04,400
<i>This'll serve as the home for the
track and field events for Special Olympics.</i>

998
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:06,400
The games are coming up next, live!

999
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:09,000
<i>I'd like to place $5,000 on Jeffy.</i>

1000
01:04:10,300 --> 01:04:12,300
On Jeffy, huh?

1001
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:15,700
You got it.

1002
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:20,500
<i>Let me win. But if I cannot win,
let me be brave in the attempt.</i>

1003
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:26,800
<i>First up in the pentathlon, the long jump.</i>

1004
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:36,700
<i> You gotta love the grit
and determination of these very special athletes.</i>

1005
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:40,000
Oh, oh, oh!

1006
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:42,200
<i>Up next, Glen Chervin.</i>

1007
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:46,500
<i>This young man has competed in
the last five Special Olympics...</i>

1008
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:48,600
<i>Always finishing near the top.</i>

1009
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:54,800
<i>5.5 meters!
Wow, that's one heck of a jump!</i>

1010
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:56,200
<i>Jeffy!</i>

1011
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:02,700
<i>And newcomer Jeffy Dahmor, with an "O."</i>

1012
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:06,100
<i>This is Jeffy's first Special Olympics.</i>

1013
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:11,700
<i>Whoa! 6. 1 meters!</i>

1014
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:14,300
<i>That's gonna be hard to beat!</i>

1015
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:17,700
<i>Here comes Jimmy Washington,
always the crowd favorite.</i>

1016
01:05:17,700 --> 01:05:20,600
<i>You know, when it comes to
Special Olympics records...</i>

1017
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:23,300
<i>Jimmy practically wrote the book.</i>

1018
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:38,000
<i> 6.5 meters!
And Jimmy Washington wins the long jump!</i>

1019
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,600
Hey! Jimmy!

1020
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,900
<i>Next up, it's the shot put.</i>

1021
01:05:57,600 --> 01:05:59,200
<i>- Thomas Opedio.</i>

1022
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:02,500
<i>You know this guy might not be
the most talented athlete here...</i>

1023
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:05,600
<i>but he's certainly got
one of the biggest hearts.</i>

1024
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:07,500
<i>- Glen Chervin...</i>

1025
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:11,000
<i>with quite a nice toss!</i>

1026
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:15,000
<i>Jimmy Washington tosses it
just a bit further!</i>

1027
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,800
It's Jeffy Dahmor's turn.

1028
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:24,800
<i>- And yes!
- Come on!</i>

1029
01:06:26,300 --> 01:06:28,700
<i>We have today's first upset!</i>

1030
01:06:28,700 --> 01:06:32,500
<i>The newcomer, Jeffy Dahmor,
wins the shot put!</i>

1031
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:42,000
<i>And the officials have raised
the bar now to 1.6 meters.</i>

1032
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,300
<i>This is quite high
for most of the athletes.</i>

1033
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:45,900
<i>Glen Chervin tries.</i>

1034
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:49,200
<i>- Oh!</i>

1035
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:51,500
<i>Even the great Jimmy Washington
is having trouble.</i>

1036
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,400
Do it, Jeffy!
Do it, Jeffy!

1037
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:55,700
<i>It's all up to Jeffy Dahmor now.</i>

1038
01:06:55,700 --> 01:07:01,500
<i>And he does it! Jeffy Dahmor wins
his second consecutive event!</i>

1039
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:06,900
Runners, take your mark.

1040
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:10,400
<i>And now, the final event of the day...</i>

1041
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:13,400
<i>the 100-meter hurdles.</i>

1042
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:19,100
Set!

1043
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:23,500
Come on, Jeffy!
Leap! Leap!

1044
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:29,300
Jump higher!
Jump higher!

1045
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,600
<i>Come on!
Aw, come on!</i>

1046
01:07:36,100 --> 01:07:39,300
<i> The true champion
is showing his colors today...</i>

1047
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:41,900
as Jimmy Washington easily
takes the 100-meter hurdles.

1048
01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:44,500
As Jimmy Washington easily
takes the 100-meter hurdles.

1049
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,800
<i>Wow, this is truly amazing, folks.</i>

1050
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:56,900
<i>After four of the five events,
Jimmy Washington is only five points ahead...</i>

1051
01:07:57,300 --> 01:07:59,200
of a remarkable newcomer,
Jeffy Dahmor.

1052
01:07:59,300 --> 01:08:03,500
Folks, it has come down
to tomorrow's final event-

1053
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:07,800
the 400-meter run,
the Cadillac of Special Olympics competition.

1054
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:10,400
It's worth approximately 250 points...

1055
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:12,300
depending upon their times.

1056
01:08:12,300 --> 01:08:16,200
This will decide whether
Jimmy Washington or Jeffy Dahmor...

1057
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:17,800
<i>takes home the gold.</i>

1058
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:50,000
How come guys like us never get the girl?

1059
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,500
Don't lump me in with you.
I get the girl sometimes.

1060
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:55,800
Calm down.
I was just trying to cheer you up.

1061
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:58,300
How?
By calling us both losers?

1062
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:02,000
Can I have your autograph, Jimmy?
Please?

1063
01:09:02,100 --> 01:09:03,200
Yeah.
Jesus.

1064
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,900
- Hi, Lynn.
- Oh, hey, Jeffy.

1065
01:09:08,900 --> 01:09:11,100
Where's your date?

1066
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:13,300
Jeffy's kinda stag tonight.

1067
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:15,100
Oh. That's okay.

1068
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:20,000
I haven't eaten in, like, 10 minutes.
You wanna find some food?

1069
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:20,400
Ten minutes!

1070
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:23,500
Come on. Let's go.

1071
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:31,500
You'll have to excuse me.

1072
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,400
I kinda pig out
when I get depressed.

1073
01:09:34,100 --> 01:09:35,000
Why Lynn depressed?

1074
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:39,500
Oh, I'm upset 'cause of... David.

1075
01:09:42,100 --> 01:09:43,900
- Tell Jeffy joke.
- What?

1076
01:09:43,900 --> 01:09:45,800
The joke with the boy at sea.

1077
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:48,000
- The one you were gonna tell at lunch.
- Oh.

1078
01:09:49,100 --> 01:09:51,000
You don't wanna hear me butcher it.

1079
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,700
Oh, come on.
I bet you knock it out of the park.

1080
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:57,200
Okay. Okay.

1081
01:09:57,300 --> 01:09:59,200
So, there's this old woman.

1082
01:09:59,900 --> 01:10:04,000
She was, like, you know, a grandmother.
She was, like, 80 or something.

1083
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:05,400
And she brings
her grandson to the beach.

1084
01:10:05,900 --> 01:10:08,800
And he's little.
He's, like, you know, three, or-

1085
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:12,400
or, like, three-and-a-half,
or four-ish, you know-

1086
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:13,700
The boy's young.
Jeffy get it.

1087
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:16,400
Okay. Well, the grandmother-

1088
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:19,300
Jeffy!
The Kids of Widney High is on!

1089
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:23,100
- Come on!
- Okay! Okay!

1090
01:10:39,700 --> 01:10:42,200
I've never seen Billy this excited before.

1091
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:45,600
Billy a big fan
of Kids of Widney High...

1092
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:49,400
so Jeffy called number on back of CD
and asked them to come.

1093
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:52,000
That was really nice of you.

1094
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:54,100
You never stop surprising me.

1095
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:57,100
You're a really good person, Jeffy.
You know that?

1096
01:10:57,100 --> 01:11:01,200
- Thank you.
- You wanna dance?

1097
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,700
No, no.
Jeffy not a good dancer.

1098
01:11:04,700 --> 01:11:06,600
- Come on!
- No. No!

1099
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,600
Would you teach Jeffy
how to slow-dance?

1100
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:58,300
Yeah. Sure. Come on.

1101
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:04,700
Okay, you're gonna
put your arms around me.

1102
01:12:04,700 --> 01:12:07,600
No, no. Not on my stomach.
Just sort of around my waist.

1103
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:10,300
And I'll put my arms around you,
and we'll just move.

1104
01:12:10,700 --> 01:12:12,600
Okay.

1105
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:26,800
What's wrong?

1106
01:12:28,300 --> 01:12:34,200
Special Olympics are almost over, and...

1107
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:36,200
Jeffy's gonna miss Lynn.

1108
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:39,200
Oh, no.
Hey, we'll still hang out.

1109
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:41,100
We'll still be friends.

1110
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:45,500
Jeffy would like that.

1111
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:52,100
Lynn's perfect.

1112
01:12:52,100 --> 01:12:56,600
Makes Jeffy wanna
wake up in the morning.

1113
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:03,900
Lynn needs someone to appreciate her...

1114
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:07,000
like she's the only girl on the planet.

1115
01:13:13,700 --> 01:13:14,600
That's-

1116
01:13:16,300 --> 01:13:19,400
That's the nicest thing
anybody's ever said to me.

1117
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:22,500
I think you're pretty perfect too, Jeffy.

1118
01:13:22,700 --> 01:13:26,200
You're kind and funny.

1119
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:27,700
And really brave.

1120
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:37,100
Oh, Jeffy, no, no-
I'm- I'm sorry. I didn't-

1121
01:13:37,100 --> 01:13:39,400
- It's Jeffy's fault.
- No, it's not your fault. It's not.

1122
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:40,900
You did nothing wrong.
I- Um-

1123
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:43,700
God. I'm sorry.
I-Jeffy, I have to- I-

1124
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:09,000
Billy, you up?

1125
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,200
No.

1126
01:14:14,100 --> 01:14:16,800
Let me ask you something.

1127
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:19,400
Do you think there are
good people and bad people...

1128
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:23,000
or do you think life gets so hard...

1129
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,600
sometimes good people
have to do bad things?

1130
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:30,100
Nah. Just good people
and bad people.

1131
01:14:30,100 --> 01:14:32,100
There's no gray areas.

1132
01:14:35,900 --> 01:14:37,700
Good luck.

1133
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:46,600
<i>It's entirely my fault.</i>

1134
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:49,600
<i>- There's no way it was your fault.
- Matt, you weren't there.</i>

1135
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:51,200
I'm a volunteer.
He's an athlete.

1136
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:52,400
It's not allowed.

1137
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:55,000
And I let him think it was a real date.

1138
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:58,100
I don't deserve to be here.

1139
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:01,800
<i>I- I can't do this anymore.</i>

1140
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:02,800
<i>What are you saying?</i>

1141
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:06,800
<i>I'm done. It's over for me.</i>

1142
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:15,900
Steve Levy here with arguably the greatest
Special Olympian of all time, Jimmy Washington.

1143
01:15:15,900 --> 01:15:19,400
Jimmy, folks at home wanna know: What
are you feeling heading into today's final event?

1144
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:21,900
I feel great, like always.

1145
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:22,400
Jimmy's gonna win.

1146
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:26,000
You've won six
consecutive gold medals.

1147
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,900
This Jeffy Dahmor
could get in the way of number seven.

1148
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:30,800
Jeffy Dahmor.
Who's Jeffy Dahmor?

1149
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:32,800
Look at me.

1150
01:15:32,900 --> 01:15:35,800
I'm young, handsome, top shape.

1151
01:15:35,900 --> 01:15:37,600
Bring on Jeffy Dahmor.

1152
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:39,200
Jimmy's gon' bring home the gold.

1153
01:15:39,900 --> 01:15:42,600
Clearly, lack of confidence
will not be an issue.

1154
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:46,500
Steve Levy reporting from Bobcat Stadium,
home of Special Olympics.

1155
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:49,000
<i>So here we go. This is it.</i>

1156
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:52,700
<i>Will Jimmy Washington win
his seventh consecutive gold medal...</i>

1157
01:15:52,700 --> 01:15:55,000
or is there a new champion
on the horizon?

1158
01:15:55,100 --> 01:15:59,000
Ladies and gentlemen, if you're not
enjoying this action, check your pulse.

1159
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:11,100
Jimmy, you're goin' down.

1160
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:14,800
<i>Good-bye, Wheaties.
Good-bye, Hollywood Squares.</i>

1161
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:16,700
Good-bye, bling-bling.

1162
01:16:17,700 --> 01:16:20,000
<i>On your mark!</i>

1163
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:25,500
<i>Set!</i>

1164
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:55,100
Come on!
Hustle! Hustle! Come on!

1165
01:16:58,900 --> 01:17:03,900
Now's your moment! Now's your chance!
Go for it! Go! Go! Go!

1166
01:17:07,100 --> 01:17:08,300
Come on! Hustle!
Come on!

1167
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:15,100
That's it! That's it!

1168
01:17:23,300 --> 01:17:25,700
- Ohh!
- Thank you, God! Thank you!

1169
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,500
What are you doin'?
What are you doin'?

1170
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,700
Don't go back!
Go this way!

1171
01:17:36,300 --> 01:17:38,100
That a boy, Jeffy!

1172
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,600
Come on, Jimmy, get up.

1173
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:45,500
- That's it. Get him up.
- What are you doing, you stupid son of a bitch?

1174
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
You're a loser!
You'll always be a loser!

1175
01:18:10,700 --> 01:18:13,700
<i>So, Glen Chervin
wins the 400-meter race.</i>

1176
01:18:13,700 --> 01:18:15,500
<i>And here we go.
Thank you.</i>

1177
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:16,800
Ladies and gentlemen, wow!

1178
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:21,000
In a stunning upset, the gold medal
goes to a remarkable young underdog.

1179
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,700
It's Glen Chervin!

1180
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:27,100
Jimmy, you suck!

1181
01:18:27,100 --> 01:18:30,200
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Jimmy didn't win?

1182
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:32,300
Jimmy didn't win!

1183
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:35,800
Isn't it wonderful?
Jimmy didn't win! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

1184
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
You did great.

1185
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,900
I came in fourth.

1186
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:47,300
That's okay, Thomas.
I came in last in my race.

1187
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:49,700
You complete me.

1188
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:52,200
I do?

1189
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,600
<i>Glen! You won!</i>

1190
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:00,500
What? I did?

1191
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:03,600
Oh, I'm sorry.

1192
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,600
What are you sorry about?

1193
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:08,500
Well, now Stavi
can't get his fingers back.

1194
01:19:08,700 --> 01:19:12,200
No, he can.
All Jimmy had to do was lose.

1195
01:19:12,300 --> 01:19:14,500
And he did... because of you!

1196
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:19,700
Well, if I knew that,
I wouldn't have stayed behind you so long.

1197
01:19:19,700 --> 01:19:21,200
Excuse me.

1198
01:19:22,100 --> 01:19:23,600
Whoo!

1199
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:25,900
Jeffy!
You were so great.

1200
01:19:25,900 --> 01:19:28,300
I'm- I'm so proud of you.

1201
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:32,600
Thanks.

1202
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,800
Congratulations, Jeffy.
Great race.

1203
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:41,000
Would you come with me, please?

1204
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:43,100
That was terrific sportsmanship, Jeffy.

1205
01:19:46,100 --> 01:19:49,500
<i>And now,
the bronze medal goes to Jeffy Dahmor!</i>

1206
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:51,000
<i>That's my son, Jeffy!</i>

1207
01:19:52,100 --> 01:19:55,100
My son, Jeffy!

1208
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:02,700
Congratulations, Jeffy.

1209
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:05,800
The winner of the silver medal,
Jimmy Washington!

1210
01:20:08,300 --> 01:20:10,400
Congratulations, Jimmy.

1211
01:20:11,900 --> 01:20:15,200
<i>And the gold medal
goes to Glen Chervin!</i>

1212
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:21,200
<i>- Congratulations, Glen.
- You're welcome!</i>

1213
01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:25,800
Let's have a big round of applause
for our terrific pentathlon athletes!

1214
01:20:34,100 --> 01:20:36,100
<i>Thank you for coming out,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

1215
01:20:36,100 --> 01:20:38,800
- This has been the best Special-
- Excuse me.

1216
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:41,100
- Can I see that?
- Oh, sure.

1217
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:48,700
<i>Excuse me, everyone.</i>

1218
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
I have something to say.

1219
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,500
I can't accept this.

1220
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:07,100
<i>I can't accept this because...</i>

1221
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:09,000
I'm a fraud.

1222
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:15,600
Oy.

1223
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,500
I'm not...

1224
01:21:20,900 --> 01:21:22,800
mentally challenged.

1225
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:33,000
<i>- I don't even deserve to be on
the same field as these people.
- That's right!</i>

1226
01:21:33,700 --> 01:21:34,900
- Yeah!
- Shit, man!

1227
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:36,900
<i>Shame on you!</i>

1228
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,700
So I'm gonna give this award
to the person-

1229
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:44,400
The champion who deserves it.

1230
01:21:47,500 --> 01:21:50,300
<i>- Thomas.
- Thomas!</i>

1231
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:53,300
<i>Come here, man.</i>

1232
01:21:56,500 --> 01:21:59,000
Stand up here.

1233
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,100
<i>All right!</i>

1234
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,300
You were right behind me, buddy.

1235
01:22:05,300 --> 01:22:07,400
This belongs to you.

1236
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:19,400
I'm so-

1237
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:23,100
This is such a great honor.

1238
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:27,700
I'm very excited
from the bottom of my heart.

1239
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:31,000
And I would like to dedicate this...

1240
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:35,800
to a very, very special girl
named-

1241
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:41,500
Lynn, I am so-

1242
01:22:45,300 --> 01:22:46,300
<i>Oh, geez!</i>

1243
01:22:46,700 --> 01:22:49,200
Oh, and today...

1244
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:50,700
<i>I would- I would like...</i>

1245
01:22:50,700 --> 01:22:51,800
to meditate on some facts.

1246
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:56,600
Did you know that Mentos
is America's number-one candy?

1247
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:58,500
<i>And also-</i>

1248
01:22:58,500 --> 01:23:02,500
<i>And, um-And, Karen...</i>

1249
01:23:02,500 --> 01:23:05,700
<i>I w- I would- I would like to-</i>

1250
01:23:34,500 --> 01:23:36,800
But soft! What light
through yonder window breaks?

1251
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:40,600
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
Yada-yada-yada.

1252
01:23:41,500 --> 01:23:44,100
<i>Come on, Billy.
You're phoning it in.</i>

1253
01:23:44,100 --> 01:23:47,900
Look, I told you-Jackie Gleason
didn't rehearse, and neither do I.

1254
01:23:47,900 --> 01:23:51,300
You scratched my CD, you know.

1255
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:54,700
You picked it up in clear daylight
and you scratched it.

1256
01:23:54,700 --> 01:23:57,500
Yeah, I know. But I thought
we put that behind us.

1257
01:23:57,500 --> 01:23:59,300
Now, come on, Billy.
Let's do it. From the top.

1258
01:24:00,100 --> 01:24:02,200
Keep your pants on, Spielberg.

1259
01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:04,400
Thanks for springin' for lunch.

1260
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:07,500
Next time we'll go Danish
and split it 60-60.

1261
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:09,300
Don't you mean 50-50?

1262
01:24:09,300 --> 01:24:11,400
What, you don't tip?

1263
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:15,100
I'm so glad you called. I missed you.
It's great to catch up.

1264
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:16,800
Yeah. Good times.

1265
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:21,100
Listen, you wanna come in
and meet some of the fellas I work with?

1266
01:24:21,100 --> 01:24:23,000
- They're a hoot.
- Sure.

1267
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:28,600
Come on, Billy.
From the top.

1268
01:24:28,900 --> 01:24:30,200
Okay.

1269
01:24:30,500 --> 01:24:33,400
But soft! What light-

1270
01:24:34,500 --> 01:24:36,500
Could you fix the lighting, please?

1271
01:24:38,700 --> 01:24:40,400
What?

1272
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:43,000
<i>Steve, please. Be a love.</i>

1273
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:46,700
<i>Thomas, where's my water?
My throat is parched.</i>

1274
01:24:46,700 --> 01:24:50,200
What kind do you want,
Evian or tap water?

1275
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:52,400
Surprise me.

1276
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:54,800
Freakin' stars.

1277
01:24:55,200 --> 01:24:57,600
Hey, guys!
Look what the cat dragged in.

1278
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,400
<i>- Hi, Lynn!
- Hi, Lynn!</i>

1279
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:03,600
- Hi, Lynn!
- Whoa!

1280
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:05,900
Oh, my God! Are you okay?

1281
01:25:05,900 --> 01:25:08,300
<i>- Oh!
- You okay, Mr. Stevie?</i>

1282
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:10,300
How many fingers do you see?

1283
01:25:10,300 --> 01:25:12,100
Do you need a medic?

1284
01:25:12,100 --> 01:25:15,800
He probably needs
mouth-to-mouth, Lynn.

1285
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:18,000
I'll do it!

1286
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:20,100
I'm good!
I'm fine!

1287
01:25:20,100 --> 01:25:21,400
- Come on, baby.
- Mr. Clumsy.

1288
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:23,700
<i>- Are you sure you're okay?
- I- I'm fine.</i>

1289
01:25:23,700 --> 01:25:26,000
Broke the fall with my forehead.

1290
01:25:26,100 --> 01:25:28,400
<i>Steve gave us all jobs.</i>

1291
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:30,700
Isn't that wonderfully nice, Lynn?

1292
01:25:30,700 --> 01:25:33,200
One could almost say Christ-like.

1293
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:35,100
Yeah.

1294
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:38,700
I'm starting to feel like
you guys are playing me.

1295
01:25:38,700 --> 01:25:41,700
<i>- Lynn, I promise I had nothing to do with it.
- It's true, Lynn.</i>

1296
01:25:41,700 --> 01:25:43,600
He's totally ignorant.

1297
01:25:43,700 --> 01:25:46,000
- Yeah.
- Thanks, Winston.

1298
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:52,500
Guys, can we be alone
for a few moments?

1299
01:25:52,500 --> 01:25:54,700
<i>- Yeah absolutely. No problem.
- Sure.</i>

1300
01:25:54,700 --> 01:25:57,300
Eye contact.

1301
01:25:59,900 --> 01:26:01,200
Come on.

1302
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:11,800
Lynn, you have no idea
how sorry I am.

1303
01:26:17,100 --> 01:26:19,200
It's okay.
I forgive you.

1304
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:21,900
- You do?
- I didn't, at first, but I forgive you.

1305
01:26:21,900 --> 01:26:26,400
<i>Oh, you saw the thing
on 20/20, and you-</i>

1306
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:28,200
<i>- No.
- Me.</i>

1307
01:26:28,200 --> 01:26:31,000
- I tell.
- Stavi?

1308
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
I told her everything-

1309
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:37,600
how you got me the job, how you scammed
the system so I could get my fingers back.

1310
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:43,100
And how you secretly
want to marry her.

1311
01:26:43,100 --> 01:26:45,700
<i>I don't remember saying that.</i>

1312
01:26:57,300 --> 01:26:59,200
Starting fresh?

1313
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:01,100
Yeah. I'd like that.

1314
01:27:03,300 --> 01:27:05,200
It's a start.

1315
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:13,500
<i>Come on!
Give him a kiss!</i>

1316
01:27:13,700 --> 01:27:17,200
<i>Get a room!
I gotta do a play here tonight!</i>

1317
01:27:33,300 --> 01:27:36,200
<i>Tickets. Tickets. Who needs tickets?
You're not a cop, are you?</i>

1318
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:40,400
You got tickets. Okay. Tickets. Cheaper
than the box office. You save some money.

1319
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:42,000
But soft!

1320
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:45,300
What light through
yonder window breaks?

1321
01:27:45,300 --> 01:27:46,600
It is the east...

1322
01:27:48,200 --> 01:27:50,800
and Juliet is the sun.

1323
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:53,300
Oh, rise, fair sun...

1324
01:27:53,300 --> 01:27:55,700
and kill the envious moon...

1325
01:27:56,700 --> 01:27:59,000
who is already sick
and pale with grief.

1326
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
<i>When he bestrides...</i>

1327
01:28:01,300 --> 01:28:04,700
<i>the lazy-pacing clouds...</i>

1328
01:28:04,700 --> 01:28:08,400
and sails upon the bosom of the air!

1329
01:28:16,200 --> 01:28:18,600
On second thought, life is short!

1330
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:21,600
I love ya!
Hit the music, fellas!
