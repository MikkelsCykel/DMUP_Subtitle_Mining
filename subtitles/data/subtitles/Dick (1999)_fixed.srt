00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:52,803
In 1974, President Richard Nixon
resigned in disgrace...

2
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,554
...amid the Watergate scandal.

3
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:57,015
One of the mysteries
of the 20th century...

4
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:59,309
...pertains to the identity
of Deep Throat...

5
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:03,479
... the inside source who leaked the
information to The Washington Post.

6
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,065
Who is Deep Throat?

7
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:08,442
Tonight, my guests will
answer that question.

8
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:09,944
Bob Woodward, Carl Bernstein...

9
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:13,322
...Post reporters who broke
the story so many years ago.

10
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:16,700
-Nice to have you here.
-Thank you for having us.

11
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:18,744
Let's just get right to it.

12
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:20,246
Who is...

13
00:01:20,454 --> 00:01:21,621
...Deep Throat?

14
00:01:23,165 --> 00:01:25,750
Well, first of all,
we're not telling you.

15
00:01:28,462 --> 00:01:32,674
Second, I was under the impression
that I would be the only guest tonight.

16
00:01:32,925 --> 00:01:34,634
Well, I guess you're not, Bob.

17
00:01:36,303 --> 00:01:38,763
You know, you guys
are getting pretty old now.

18
00:01:39,014 --> 00:01:40,348
So what's your point?

19
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:43,768
I'm wondering, are you ever
going to tell anybody...

20
00:01:44,019 --> 00:01:45,311
... who Deep Throat is...

21
00:01:45,562 --> 00:01:46,854
...before you die?

22
00:01:47,105 --> 00:01:49,482
Well, a lot bigger names than you...

23
00:01:49,732 --> 00:01:51,525
...have asked us
who Deep Throat is, so....

24
00:01:51,776 --> 00:01:54,778
I don't think we'd reveal it
on a little show like this.

25
00:01:55,029 --> 00:01:56,572
You know what I think?

26
00:01:56,823 --> 00:01:59,742
I mean, I'm just gonna
come right out and say it.

27
00:02:00,076 --> 00:02:04,163
I don't think there is a Deep Throat.
I think you made it up.

28
00:02:04,413 --> 00:02:08,750
-Yes, there is. Deep Throat is--
-Don't say it! He's trying to trick us!

29
00:02:11,086 --> 00:02:12,504
I'm sorry, Bob.

30
00:02:12,796 --> 00:02:14,088
Don't ever touch me.

31
00:02:14,339 --> 00:02:16,549
-Bob, I said I'm sorry.
-Don't ever--

32
00:02:16,925 --> 00:02:19,010
You smell like cabbage.

33
00:02:58,215 --> 00:02:59,674
Oh, fudge!

34
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,701
Dear Bobby:

35
00:03:29,453 --> 00:03:31,788
I'm having so much fun already.

36
00:03:32,373 --> 00:03:34,124
I need you to concentrate.

37
00:03:34,374 --> 00:03:35,875
-Dear Bobby:
-Hold on, hold on.

38
00:03:36,126 --> 00:03:38,127
-Here's the number one reason--
-Wait.

39
00:03:38,378 --> 00:03:42,006
Arlene, I need to have time
to review my letters.

40
00:03:43,258 --> 00:03:45,134
-We have a deadline, Betsy.
-I know.

41
00:03:45,385 --> 00:03:48,763
But I need to concentrate.
Let me just look at them.

42
00:03:49,097 --> 00:03:50,556
Okay. Dear Bobby:

43
00:03:50,807 --> 00:03:53,809
Here's the number one reason
that I think--

44
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,020
Okay, I'm ready.

45
00:03:57,063 --> 00:03:58,189
"A."

46
00:03:59,857 --> 00:04:01,149
Dear Bobby:

47
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,570
Here's the number one reason that
I think that you should choose me...

48
00:04:05,821 --> 00:04:07,197
...Arlene Lorenzo...

49
00:04:07,448 --> 00:04:10,284
...for the "Win A Date
With Bobby Sherman" contest...

50
00:04:10,534 --> 00:04:12,994
-...in Tiger Beat magazine.
-Hold on. Wait.

51
00:04:13,245 --> 00:04:14,621
Number one: I love you.

52
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:17,457
And number two:
I just think you're cute.

53
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:20,418
B, B. Oh, my God,
they're both together.

54
00:04:20,669 --> 00:04:25,340
But the main reason that I think
you should pick me, Arlene Lorenzo...

55
00:04:25,882 --> 00:04:28,509
...is because we're soul mates, Bobby.

56
00:04:30,011 --> 00:04:32,138
You are so brilliant, Arlene.

57
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:35,725
So what do we have so far?

58
00:04:36,893 --> 00:04:38,352
" Dear Bobb...

59
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,145
...y:"

60
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,984
I think maybe I could type
faster than you.

61
00:04:45,234 --> 00:04:48,487
Four more years!
Four more years!

62
00:04:51,865 --> 00:04:54,242
-What are you looking at?
-Nothing.

63
00:04:56,078 --> 00:04:58,246
You seem pretty interested in nothing.

64
00:04:58,664 --> 00:04:59,790
Give me those.

65
00:05:08,173 --> 00:05:10,508
I'll take the one doing cartwheels.

66
00:05:12,969 --> 00:05:14,261
What time is it?

67
00:05:15,013 --> 00:05:15,847
Shit!

68
00:05:20,977 --> 00:05:22,937
The gemstone is glistening.

69
00:05:23,187 --> 00:05:25,564
The gemstone is glistening.

70
00:05:43,623 --> 00:05:45,458
She's finally asleep!

71
00:05:45,792 --> 00:05:49,295
The deadline to enter the contest
is midnight. We have to hurry.

72
00:05:50,171 --> 00:05:52,298
We have to mail this letter. Go...

73
00:05:52,549 --> 00:05:54,884
...so I can win,
or I swear I'll die.

74
00:06:01,265 --> 00:06:03,141
-Evening, Mr. Whipple.
-Evening.

75
00:06:03,392 --> 00:06:05,477
Don't squeeze the Charmin.

76
00:06:06,562 --> 00:06:07,771
-Hi, Dad.
-Hi, Georgie.

77
00:06:08,022 --> 00:06:10,983
-Can I carry the Charmin?
-Yep, but no squeezing.

78
00:06:11,233 --> 00:06:12,984
What did you do in the store today?

79
00:06:13,402 --> 00:06:15,028
You should've seen it.

80
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:18,490
There I was, and these two ladies
were squeezing the Charmin.

81
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:27,373
This way, we can get back in
without having to go to the lobby.

82
00:06:27,707 --> 00:06:30,000
So nobody'll ever see us
and tell my mom.

83
00:06:33,129 --> 00:06:34,713
You're a genius!

84
00:06:58,445 --> 00:06:59,612
Down, down!

85
00:06:59,905 --> 00:07:01,239
It's Fat Freddy.

86
00:07:08,246 --> 00:07:10,247
That is so disgusting.

87
00:07:11,124 --> 00:07:12,583
Go, go, go!

88
00:07:34,563 --> 00:07:35,730
What the--?

89
00:07:37,775 --> 00:07:38,901
Oh, shit!

90
00:07:40,611 --> 00:07:43,780
Max, call the cops.
Looks like we got a break-in here.

91
00:07:45,115 --> 00:07:46,908
You know why I love Bobby?

92
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:50,537
Because he cares about people,
but also about nature and ecology.

93
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:54,623
I need a status report.
Give me a 20 for gemstone. Over.

94
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:56,500
Jewel thieves!

95
00:07:56,793 --> 00:07:57,752
Really?

96
00:07:58,753 --> 00:08:00,087
Hold it!

97
00:08:03,633 --> 00:08:05,092
Get away from us!

98
00:08:07,261 --> 00:08:10,097
Young people running wild
in the middle of the night.

99
00:08:12,433 --> 00:08:16,436
By the time you're grown, you'll be
living in the Soviet Union of America!

100
00:08:27,072 --> 00:08:28,615
She's still out like a light.

101
00:08:37,832 --> 00:08:40,125
We have the suspects in custody!

102
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,712
It was a jewel heist.

103
00:08:42,962 --> 00:08:45,339
See if you can get
any statements from them.

104
00:08:49,135 --> 00:08:50,219
Arlene?

105
00:08:50,511 --> 00:08:51,637
Betsy?

106
00:08:51,971 --> 00:08:54,139
What are you two doing up at this hour?

107
00:08:56,684 --> 00:08:58,185
Nothing.

108
00:08:58,894 --> 00:09:02,647
Last night, five men were arrested
in the Democratic Committee office...

109
00:09:02,898 --> 00:09:05,567
... during an attempted burglary
at the Watergate complex.

110
00:09:05,817 --> 00:09:07,026
It has been confirmed...

111
00:09:07,277 --> 00:09:10,988
... that one of the arrested was
formerly an employee of the CIA.

112
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,825
Aren't you students excited...

113
00:09:14,075 --> 00:09:18,621
...about visiting the home of
the President and the first family?

114
00:09:18,871 --> 00:09:20,747
Well, not really.

115
00:09:20,998 --> 00:09:25,544
And after our tour,
we're having lunch at McDonald's.

116
00:09:28,589 --> 00:09:30,340
I love McDonald's so much!

117
00:09:30,591 --> 00:09:32,843
French fries! French fries!

118
00:09:38,182 --> 00:09:40,559
He looks like he's wearing blush.

119
00:09:47,983 --> 00:09:50,068
That guy has T.P. stuck to his shoe.

120
00:09:50,652 --> 00:09:51,778
Hey, mister!

121
00:09:52,904 --> 00:09:54,864
-Hey, you!
-Shorty, turn around.

122
00:09:56,074 --> 00:09:57,992
Young lady, I am a very busy man.

123
00:09:58,243 --> 00:09:59,494
Wait a minute, I know you.

124
00:09:59,744 --> 00:10:01,829
Me too. But from where?

125
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,289
I don't know.

126
00:10:03,539 --> 00:10:05,457
Do you sell corn dogs at the mall?

127
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:09,711
As far as you're concerned,
I have no identity at all.

128
00:10:10,046 --> 00:10:11,547
As a matter of fact...

129
00:10:12,089 --> 00:10:13,757
...l'm not even here.

130
00:10:14,883 --> 00:10:17,135
He's way weirder than the corn-dog guy.

131
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,847
And this isn't T.P.

132
00:10:21,098 --> 00:10:24,476
It's a piece of paper with names
and amounts of money on it.

133
00:10:25,268 --> 00:10:26,769
" CREEP list"?

134
00:10:27,229 --> 00:10:30,607
I guess all the people
on that list must be creeps.

135
00:10:31,566 --> 00:10:32,775
Souvenir.

136
00:10:33,735 --> 00:10:35,069
Let's go.

137
00:10:40,658 --> 00:10:42,993
Jesus, Gordon, they're just
little girls.

138
00:10:43,661 --> 00:10:47,706
They were in the Watergate last night.
They know too much, Bob.

139
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:51,501
I want to interrogate them.

140
00:10:52,878 --> 00:10:57,090
I think you've done enough,
what with bumbling the burglary and all.

141
00:10:57,466 --> 00:10:59,926
Just pay off all your guys
on that CREEP list.

142
00:11:00,177 --> 00:11:03,013
Don't worry about that.
I've got that right here.

143
00:11:03,305 --> 00:11:07,851
G. Gordon Liddy isn't going to let down
the President of the United States.

144
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:13,773
Would you ladies like to see
the west wing of the White House?

145
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:24,075
Sorry.

146
00:11:26,744 --> 00:11:28,162
This is fun.

147
00:11:29,705 --> 00:11:31,498
Look at that b--

148
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,044
Ladies...

149
00:11:37,046 --> 00:11:39,339
...when you think of your President...

150
00:11:39,757 --> 00:11:41,008
...do you think...

151
00:11:41,341 --> 00:11:43,176
...friendly thoughts?

152
00:11:47,014 --> 00:11:48,974
I don't think about him that much.

153
00:11:49,224 --> 00:11:50,975
But when you do...

154
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,394
...you don't think...

155
00:11:53,687 --> 00:11:55,271
...unfriendly thoughts, do you?

156
00:11:58,691 --> 00:12:01,985
So you would never want
to do anything that might...

157
00:12:02,195 --> 00:12:03,404
...hurt...

158
00:12:03,654 --> 00:12:04,488
...the President?

159
00:12:04,739 --> 00:12:06,407
Never. No.

160
00:12:06,908 --> 00:12:07,992
Because you see--

161
00:12:10,328 --> 00:12:12,371
Excuse me, Mr. Haldeman.

162
00:12:12,621 --> 00:12:15,665
It's your wife.
She says it's rather urgent.

163
00:12:19,503 --> 00:12:21,212
Excuse me, ladies.

164
00:12:26,843 --> 00:12:28,010
Hello, dear.

165
00:12:29,846 --> 00:12:32,098
Just putting out a little fire here.

166
00:12:32,724 --> 00:12:34,934
I can stop by the store
on the way home.

167
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,311
A dozen? The poppy kind.

168
00:12:37,562 --> 00:12:41,065
I'll tell you the problem.
The dog doesn't like me.

169
00:12:41,524 --> 00:12:45,861
Kennedy and Johnson had dogs
that liked them. That's the problem.

170
00:12:46,112 --> 00:12:50,199
Mr. President, maybe you should
show the dog more affection.

171
00:12:50,408 --> 00:12:52,493
Maybe I ought to fire you!

172
00:12:53,828 --> 00:12:55,246
Come on, boy.

173
00:12:56,664 --> 00:12:58,540
Looks away. Doesn't look at me.

174
00:12:58,749 --> 00:13:00,250
What'd I do to him? Nothing.

175
00:13:00,501 --> 00:13:02,794
You're supposed to love me, Checkers.

176
00:13:03,003 --> 00:13:05,922
Shouldn't you call him
King Timahoe, sir?

177
00:13:08,884 --> 00:13:09,718
Come here.

178
00:13:10,302 --> 00:13:11,594
Where's he going?

179
00:13:13,638 --> 00:13:15,598
No, I am not uptight.

180
00:13:15,932 --> 00:13:18,392
When did you start
talking like that, anyway?

181
00:13:19,435 --> 00:13:21,228
What's going on in here?

182
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:25,482
Mr. President, if I may.

183
00:13:25,733 --> 00:13:27,442
Look how cute you are.
Come here.

184
00:13:29,654 --> 00:13:30,696
It's the President.

185
00:13:30,946 --> 00:13:35,408
I mean, all I asked for
was a simple bugging, all right?

186
00:13:35,659 --> 00:13:37,619
I don't know how many times
we've done that.

187
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:39,997
And here they go and screw it up.

188
00:13:40,998 --> 00:13:43,375
Hi, puppy. Nice puppy!

189
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:44,876
Nice puppy!

190
00:13:46,128 --> 00:13:47,671
Have you paid them off yet?

191
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:50,006
CREEP has made up
a list of who to pay off...

192
00:13:50,257 --> 00:13:52,133
...and Liddy's taking care of it now.

193
00:13:55,345 --> 00:13:57,430
Are you the President's dog trainer?

194
00:13:57,722 --> 00:14:01,058
I'm John Dean,
Chief White House Counsel.

195
00:14:02,936 --> 00:14:04,395
That's too bad.

196
00:14:06,689 --> 00:14:07,564
Oh, thank you!

197
00:14:07,815 --> 00:14:09,316
That one lives in the Watergate.

198
00:14:09,567 --> 00:14:11,735
They were there
the night of the break-in.

199
00:14:11,944 --> 00:14:12,944
Do they know anything?

200
00:14:13,195 --> 00:14:15,530
I love your ears.
Look at the ears!

201
00:14:15,865 --> 00:14:19,576
Sir, I've met yams with more going
on upstairs than those two.

202
00:14:19,827 --> 00:14:20,994
Now, Bob.

203
00:14:21,829 --> 00:14:23,705
I remember when...

204
00:14:23,997 --> 00:14:26,332
...when Julie...

205
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,794
...and what's her name, Tricia...

206
00:14:29,127 --> 00:14:30,753
...were that age.

207
00:14:31,004 --> 00:14:35,800
If it wasn't about makeup or
Frankie Avalon, they didn't give a hoot.

208
00:14:37,218 --> 00:14:40,304
-You're the softest dog.
-What should I do with them?

209
00:14:41,181 --> 00:14:42,807
I'll take care of it.

210
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:47,853
How're you doing, young ladies?

211
00:14:48,104 --> 00:14:49,605
What are your names?

212
00:14:49,981 --> 00:14:52,441
I'm Betsy and this is Arlene,
Mr. President.

213
00:14:52,692 --> 00:14:54,151
Call me Dick.

214
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:55,735
Hi, Dick.

215
00:14:55,986 --> 00:14:56,986
How old are you?

216
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,488
Fifteen.

217
00:14:59,239 --> 00:15:02,742
We have an urgent communiqué
from Anderson Air Force Base.

218
00:15:02,951 --> 00:15:03,951
What?

219
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:05,412
So cute.

220
00:15:05,913 --> 00:15:09,791
Excuse me, I wasn't informed
that you are in the middle of....

221
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:11,959
What are you in the middle of?

222
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:13,836
One minute, Henry.

223
00:15:14,254 --> 00:15:15,505
Young ladies...

224
00:15:16,423 --> 00:15:18,758
...l've got a proposition for you.

225
00:15:19,717 --> 00:15:22,219
How would you two
be interested in being...

226
00:15:22,428 --> 00:15:26,181
...official White House dog walkers?
What do you think?

227
00:15:28,351 --> 00:15:29,393
Really?

228
00:15:30,978 --> 00:15:32,312
Jesus!

229
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:34,398
Who are these little girls?

230
00:15:34,648 --> 00:15:37,150
I don't know, but it doesn't
look constitutional to me.

231
00:15:37,401 --> 00:15:38,276
Thank you!

232
00:15:38,527 --> 00:15:41,196
-Thank you so much.
-We're gonna walk you!

233
00:15:41,447 --> 00:15:44,157
-I'm so happy.
-Thank you. I'm really excited!

234
00:15:44,408 --> 00:15:45,992
Sure. Very good.

235
00:15:46,451 --> 00:15:49,245
Mr. President, really,
we have to make a decision...

236
00:15:49,496 --> 00:15:52,999
...regarding offensive action
north of the 22nd parallel.

237
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,001
Bottom line, Henry...

238
00:15:55,252 --> 00:15:57,921
...is we bomb them
or we don't, isn't it?

239
00:15:58,171 --> 00:15:59,922
I wouldn't put it exactly in that--

240
00:16:00,548 --> 00:16:01,840
I have something to say.

241
00:16:02,091 --> 00:16:03,091
Go on, Arlene.

242
00:16:04,719 --> 00:16:08,556
War is not healthy for children
and other living things.

243
00:16:10,057 --> 00:16:13,226
Henry, that's the voice
of the youth of America.

244
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,771
Yeah, well, first of all...

245
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:18,774
...it wasn't a war
that this administration started.

246
00:16:19,316 --> 00:16:21,860
Henry, Jesus, let's not start that.

247
00:16:22,069 --> 00:16:24,237
Isn't there somebody
waiting out there for me?

248
00:16:24,488 --> 00:16:26,364
The Joint Chiefs of Staff.
Let's go!

249
00:16:26,615 --> 00:16:29,117
Welcome on board.
Hey, good to have you.

250
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:31,745
Mr. Haldeman, it's your wife.

251
00:16:31,995 --> 00:16:34,205
Have a great day. Congratulations!

252
00:16:34,456 --> 00:16:36,374
I don't have time to talk to her.

253
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:40,044
-You're starting another war!
-I don't have time to talk to her.

254
00:16:40,295 --> 00:16:43,256
If you have a problem with Vietnam,
talk to Johnson.

255
00:16:43,506 --> 00:16:45,674
-He's dead!
-Yeah, thank God.

256
00:16:45,925 --> 00:16:49,428
Do we bomb or not bomb?
Let's get this done with today.

257
00:16:56,977 --> 00:16:58,645
There they are.

258
00:17:03,108 --> 00:17:04,234
I'm sorry!

259
00:17:04,485 --> 00:17:06,236
We're coming!

260
00:17:07,613 --> 00:17:10,073
Because of your thoughtlessness...

261
00:17:10,324 --> 00:17:13,118
...we have missed the field trip lunch
at McDonald's...

262
00:17:13,368 --> 00:17:17,163
...which the students on
the other buses are now enjoying.

263
00:17:17,414 --> 00:17:19,082
We will return to school...

264
00:17:19,332 --> 00:17:21,500
...for a cold lunch...

265
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,252
...in the cafeteria.

266
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:27,131
But we really did meet the President.
I swear to God.

267
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:30,843
And he did ask us to be
the official White House dog walkers.

268
00:17:33,763 --> 00:17:36,056
Every lie is another brick...

269
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:39,351
...in the pathway to hell.

270
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:54,699
You're so stupid.

271
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,243
I hate you.

272
00:18:39,909 --> 00:18:42,119
Guess what happened to us today!

273
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:47,458
What's the matter?

274
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:50,210
Your brother got his letter.

275
00:18:51,337 --> 00:18:53,213
I got drafted.

276
00:18:53,756 --> 00:18:56,800
Now you can get my room,
like you always wanted.

277
00:19:08,353 --> 00:19:09,937
Betsy, are you okay?

278
00:19:13,358 --> 00:19:14,567
I'm fine.

279
00:19:15,569 --> 00:19:19,697
I was wondering what we'll do with
his crappy bed, dresser and nightstand.

280
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:25,411
You think the President meant it
when he said we could walk Checkers?

281
00:19:25,411 --> 00:19:25,828
You think the President meant it
when he said we could walk Checkers?

282
00:19:26,037 --> 00:19:28,956
He's the President, Betsy.
He always means what he says.

283
00:19:29,207 --> 00:19:30,833
We should bake him cookies.

284
00:19:31,209 --> 00:19:34,378
Let's make Hello Dollies.
It's my mom's special recipe.

285
00:19:41,051 --> 00:19:44,971
All's my mom says is that my dad died
in a car crash before I was born.

286
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:47,724
You've never seen
a single picture or anything?

287
00:19:47,933 --> 00:19:51,269
She said it upset her too much,
so she threw everything away.

288
00:19:53,063 --> 00:19:56,190
No offense, but it's obvious
you're being lied to.

289
00:19:56,399 --> 00:19:58,442
The whole story is way too convenient.

290
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:02,905
Is the butter melting?

291
00:20:05,033 --> 00:20:06,492
Are you making those cookies?

292
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:08,369
Yes, but you can't have any.

293
00:20:08,619 --> 00:20:10,287
They're for the President.

294
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:16,126
Don't forget the walnuts, man.

295
00:20:21,924 --> 00:20:24,634
So you really think
that my father could be alive?

296
00:20:24,927 --> 00:20:27,888
Alive and famous.
It makes perfect sense.

297
00:20:28,096 --> 00:20:29,430
He was probably married...

298
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:33,101
...and your mom had to keep it
a secret to protect his reputation.

299
00:20:36,771 --> 00:20:39,273
How come there's little
green leaves in the walnuts?

300
00:20:39,608 --> 00:20:41,818
Larry says they're just
from the walnut tree.

301
00:20:42,068 --> 00:20:43,402
Anyway...

302
00:20:43,653 --> 00:20:46,697
...your dad could be watching you now,
his heart breaking...

303
00:20:46,948 --> 00:20:51,243
...because he can't reach out
to the only person that matters to him:

304
00:20:51,452 --> 00:20:53,537
His beautiful, darling daughter.

305
00:20:53,746 --> 00:20:55,914
My life is so tragic.

306
00:20:56,582 --> 00:20:58,709
Or it could be even worse.

307
00:20:58,959 --> 00:21:01,628
What if you fall in love
and are about to marry...

308
00:21:01,879 --> 00:21:04,423
...and you find out your
fiancé's dad is your dad too...

309
00:21:04,673 --> 00:21:06,299
...and that you're brother and sister!

310
00:21:06,592 --> 00:21:07,843
Oh, my God!

311
00:21:08,844 --> 00:21:10,762
It's called incest, Arlene...

312
00:21:11,221 --> 00:21:13,097
...and it's against the law.

313
00:21:25,235 --> 00:21:28,404
We're here to play with Checkers.
The President knows about it.

314
00:21:28,655 --> 00:21:31,324
You're not on the appointment list.
Please step back.

315
00:21:32,575 --> 00:21:35,702
The President wants us
to walk his dog, Checkers.

316
00:21:36,287 --> 00:21:39,832
Please step back.
If you don't comply, you'll be removed.

317
00:21:43,002 --> 00:21:44,628
You are a meanie!

318
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:50,174
Stupid kids.

319
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,678
I'm cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs!

320
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:57,181
I can't believe
I ate that whole thing.

321
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:58,766
You ate it, Ralph.

322
00:22:02,395 --> 00:22:06,732
Doesn't anybody realize
that Kung Fu isn't Chinese?

323
00:22:08,109 --> 00:22:11,487
He doesn't even look Chinese.
He looks like the mailman.

324
00:22:12,655 --> 00:22:15,365
Why don't you go to Canada
like Mom says?

325
00:22:15,616 --> 00:22:19,703
Too much information's coming in.
I have to maintain.

326
00:22:20,121 --> 00:22:21,747
But the old drugs aren't working.

327
00:22:22,289 --> 00:22:24,582
We need to create new drugs.

328
00:22:27,628 --> 00:22:29,921
Have you guys
been eating those cookies?

329
00:22:30,172 --> 00:22:32,257
We gave them to Mom and Dad to taste.

330
00:22:32,507 --> 00:22:35,801
They ate all of them
and started giggling and went upstairs.

331
00:22:36,053 --> 00:22:37,471
I think they're having sex now.

332
00:22:45,728 --> 00:22:46,562
I have an idea.

333
00:22:47,188 --> 00:22:48,022
What?

334
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:50,733
Let's ask the President
to stop the war.

335
00:22:53,861 --> 00:22:55,487
How will we get
into the White House?

336
00:22:55,738 --> 00:22:59,241
Unless you wanna keep the war going,
so you can have Larry's room.

337
00:23:02,828 --> 00:23:04,829
Larry's a freak and all...

338
00:23:05,205 --> 00:23:07,957
...but I'd be sad if he, you know....

339
00:23:09,668 --> 00:23:10,543
Died?

340
00:23:14,047 --> 00:23:15,882
I really hope that this works.

341
00:23:16,133 --> 00:23:16,967
Of course it will.

342
00:23:17,217 --> 00:23:19,385
You're the smartest person I know.

343
00:23:21,221 --> 00:23:22,930
But you don't know anybody.

344
00:23:36,194 --> 00:23:37,445
If you flirt with him...

345
00:23:37,695 --> 00:23:41,406
...then I can stand off to the side
and do my special whistle.

346
00:24:04,512 --> 00:24:07,431
I like your hair.
It's really dry look.

347
00:24:11,686 --> 00:24:13,187
Okay, stop that.

348
00:24:13,438 --> 00:24:15,481
We have to talk to the President.

349
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:17,107
Code yellow, central corridor.

350
00:24:17,358 --> 00:24:19,485
Code yellow, central corridor.

351
00:24:20,486 --> 00:24:21,361
Oh, my God!

352
00:24:22,405 --> 00:24:23,989
Ladies, this way.

353
00:24:25,115 --> 00:24:26,115
Let's go.

354
00:24:27,534 --> 00:24:30,286
Make sure photographers are
outside the restaurant...

355
00:24:30,537 --> 00:24:31,996
...when I come out after lunch.

356
00:24:34,374 --> 00:24:36,334
Hey, German guy!
Remember us?

357
00:24:36,752 --> 00:24:39,462
We're here to walk Checkers
and talk to Dick about the war!

358
00:24:41,506 --> 00:24:42,715
I know them.

359
00:24:43,133 --> 00:24:45,301
Yes, that's all right.
That's okay.

360
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:47,803
I'm familiar with these young ladies.

361
00:24:48,012 --> 00:24:51,098
Well, I'm not "familiar" familiar.
I know them.

362
00:24:51,349 --> 00:24:54,768
We've had discussions
about foreign policy and....

363
00:24:55,019 --> 00:24:57,146
What, what?
Don't you give me that look.

364
00:24:57,939 --> 00:24:59,273
I'll take responsibility.

365
00:24:59,523 --> 00:25:01,650
I'll be the only person
who's willing...

366
00:25:01,901 --> 00:25:03,444
...to take responsibility
for anything.

367
00:25:03,694 --> 00:25:06,321
-I think I got bruised.
-Did somebody hurt you?

368
00:25:07,656 --> 00:25:10,617
You have to remember
it took Charles de Gaulle...

369
00:25:10,868 --> 00:25:13,870
...four years to extricate
himself from Algeria.

370
00:25:14,121 --> 00:25:16,581
Not that I'm comparing
myself to de Gaulle.

371
00:25:16,832 --> 00:25:19,417
-Wars are extremely hard to stop.
-You're right.

372
00:25:19,626 --> 00:25:22,336
Rose, these young--
You're very becoming this morning.

373
00:25:22,546 --> 00:25:24,464
These ladies want
to see the President.

374
00:25:24,673 --> 00:25:28,593
Our President has the weight
of the free world on his shoulders...

375
00:25:28,802 --> 00:25:31,304
...and he doesn't have time
to see any old person.

376
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,514
Hello, girls.

377
00:25:33,765 --> 00:25:35,057
How are you?

378
00:25:35,308 --> 00:25:36,142
Come on in.

379
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:38,435
The President will see you now.

380
00:25:40,021 --> 00:25:42,064
Not you, Henry.

381
00:25:42,314 --> 00:25:44,941
That's all right.
I'm late for an interview anyway...

382
00:25:45,609 --> 00:25:48,445
-...with the Nobel Committee.
-Right.

383
00:25:49,488 --> 00:25:51,197
I'll be a monkey's uncle...

384
00:25:51,407 --> 00:25:54,701
...if these aren't
the yummiest cookies I've ever had.

385
00:25:55,869 --> 00:25:58,579
Thanks. It's a secret recipe.

386
00:25:59,039 --> 00:25:59,998
Secret, eh?

387
00:26:00,415 --> 00:26:01,374
Anyway...

388
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,752
...there doesn't seem
to be any point to it.

389
00:26:05,086 --> 00:26:06,378
Point to what?

390
00:26:07,464 --> 00:26:08,423
The war.

391
00:26:12,468 --> 00:26:13,886
See, girls...

392
00:26:14,637 --> 00:26:19,057
...we're fighting the Communists
because Communism is immoral.

393
00:26:19,308 --> 00:26:20,892
That's the whole point.

394
00:26:21,644 --> 00:26:24,354
Don't you think it's more important
what's going on here?

395
00:26:24,605 --> 00:26:25,647
What do you mean?

396
00:26:26,398 --> 00:26:28,441
Well, I mean...

397
00:26:28,651 --> 00:26:30,944
...nobody at our school's
worried about Communism...

398
00:26:31,195 --> 00:26:34,990
...but everybody talks about Mac
Washington because he got killed there.

399
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:38,284
-And Betsy's brother just got drafted.
-He's maintaining.

400
00:26:38,535 --> 00:26:39,786
He's maintaining?

401
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:42,121
Good for him.

402
00:26:43,373 --> 00:26:46,667
I think people would like you
better if you stopped the war.

403
00:26:46,918 --> 00:26:50,588
Well, don't worry your
pretty little heads. Okay?

404
00:26:50,839 --> 00:26:53,007
I think we know what we're doing.

405
00:26:55,051 --> 00:26:56,260
I guess so.

406
00:27:01,307 --> 00:27:02,391
Can we walk Checkers now?

407
00:27:02,683 --> 00:27:04,684
Yeah, go ahead. Have a ball.

408
00:27:05,561 --> 00:27:07,020
Secret recipe, eh?

409
00:27:08,063 --> 00:27:09,731
I'm feeling lightheaded.

410
00:27:10,774 --> 00:27:12,692
These are scrumptious.

411
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,237
I've gotta tell you,
I haven't felt this way in--

412
00:27:29,542 --> 00:27:32,086
Again? They must never let him out.

413
00:27:32,462 --> 00:27:35,006
I know. Would you look
at all that shit?

414
00:27:35,506 --> 00:27:37,341
Oh, I mean, poo-poo.

415
00:27:39,886 --> 00:27:41,971
I think it was left.

416
00:27:43,889 --> 00:27:46,307
That's because you couldn't go right.

417
00:27:51,271 --> 00:27:52,855
Well, let's ask someone.

418
00:27:55,984 --> 00:27:57,151
Or not.

419
00:27:57,819 --> 00:27:58,653
Come on.

420
00:27:58,904 --> 00:28:00,822
Let's go, Checkers. Come on.

421
00:28:05,785 --> 00:28:07,536
Who the hell are you?

422
00:28:08,747 --> 00:28:12,584
We're walking the dog, Checkers,
and we sort of got lost.

423
00:28:12,792 --> 00:28:14,835
We went left because
you couldn't go right.

424
00:28:15,086 --> 00:28:17,630
And we're looking
for the President's office...

425
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,632
...because that's who
we walk the dog for.

426
00:28:20,841 --> 00:28:21,925
We're really sorry.

427
00:28:22,176 --> 00:28:23,010
Shit!

428
00:28:28,641 --> 00:28:29,725
Oh, I'm so sorry.

429
00:28:29,975 --> 00:28:33,186
-We brought your dog back.
-We didn't know!

430
00:28:33,437 --> 00:28:35,146
What in bejesus is going on?

431
00:28:41,486 --> 00:28:42,820
All right, settle down.

432
00:28:43,155 --> 00:28:44,864
What's going on, Bob?

433
00:28:45,073 --> 00:28:46,782
They walked in on the shredding.

434
00:28:47,742 --> 00:28:50,703
They actually saw
documents being shredded?

435
00:28:51,746 --> 00:28:54,081
And the cash for the payoffs.

436
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:57,502
Checkers pooped.

437
00:28:58,461 --> 00:29:02,339
The President's dog doesn't poop.
He "does his business."

438
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,634
I'll take care of it.

439
00:29:05,968 --> 00:29:09,262
I've got a way with young people.
They trust me.

440
00:29:10,306 --> 00:29:12,558
Why were they shredding all that paper?

441
00:29:13,475 --> 00:29:16,602
Papier-mâché is a hobby of mine.

442
00:29:17,854 --> 00:29:19,814
Nice painting of a boat.

443
00:29:20,357 --> 00:29:21,983
Step right here, actually.

444
00:29:23,276 --> 00:29:26,487
I want to have a little
private chat with you.

445
00:29:26,863 --> 00:29:27,780
You know, today...

446
00:29:27,989 --> 00:29:32,868
...you ladies gave me some very, very
good counsel in foreign affairs.

447
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:37,873
So in addition to being
official dog walkers...

448
00:29:38,124 --> 00:29:42,044
...l'd like you to be
my Secret Youth Advisers.

449
00:29:42,253 --> 00:29:44,755
Which means you mustn't
say a thing...

450
00:29:45,006 --> 00:29:48,092
...about anything that happens
in the White House.

451
00:29:48,342 --> 00:29:50,135
Do I have your word on that?

452
00:29:51,804 --> 00:29:53,305
Swear to God?

453
00:29:53,722 --> 00:29:54,848
-Promise.
-Hope to die?

454
00:29:55,224 --> 00:29:57,309
Stick a needle in my eye!

455
00:29:58,852 --> 00:30:00,520
Congratulations.

456
00:30:06,067 --> 00:30:08,319
Are you sure, man?
Are we sure it's over?

457
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:09,654
Honey...

458
00:30:09,904 --> 00:30:13,866
...it's the President.
He's on national TV.

459
00:30:14,075 --> 00:30:18,245
If he says the war is over,
I think you can believe him.

460
00:30:19,622 --> 00:30:20,789
Sweetie.

461
00:30:21,082 --> 00:30:23,959
At 12.:30 Paris-time today...

462
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:27,629
...January 23, 1973....

463
00:30:28,672 --> 00:30:30,256
What's going on?

464
00:30:32,092 --> 00:30:33,801
I'm gonna live.

465
00:30:34,261 --> 00:30:37,222
They're pulling everybody out
of Vietnam. The war's over.

466
00:30:38,181 --> 00:30:39,724
I don't believe it.

467
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,809
She's bumming...

468
00:30:42,019 --> 00:30:45,355
...because her dreams
of being an only child are dashed.

469
00:30:45,772 --> 00:30:47,440
Larry, stop it.

470
00:30:49,109 --> 00:30:50,693
I'm not supposed to tell you this.

471
00:30:51,528 --> 00:30:55,239
But Arlene and I are the ones who asked
the President to stop the war.

472
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:58,200
We did it because
we felt sorry for you.

473
00:30:59,202 --> 00:31:00,828
You should be thanking me.

474
00:31:03,205 --> 00:31:04,998
I just want you to know...

475
00:31:05,249 --> 00:31:07,751
...whatever she's on,
I didn't give it to her.

476
00:31:10,462 --> 00:31:13,131
Well, all right.
Grooving right along.

477
00:31:13,549 --> 00:31:17,260
Betsy Jobs, your turn
to come on up and express yourself.

478
00:31:25,435 --> 00:31:26,936
Current events.

479
00:31:29,439 --> 00:31:33,484
I probably shouldn't be telling you
this because of national security...

480
00:31:34,694 --> 00:31:36,028
...but what the heck.

481
00:31:36,446 --> 00:31:38,698
Arlene Lorenzo and l...

482
00:31:39,323 --> 00:31:42,033
...are Secret Youth Advisers
for President Nixon.

483
00:31:42,618 --> 00:31:45,787
"--in addition to being
the official White House dog walkers.

484
00:31:46,038 --> 00:31:48,623
It's fun being
a Secret Youth Adviser.

485
00:31:48,916 --> 00:31:51,543
The President trusts us
with national issues."

486
00:31:51,794 --> 00:31:54,171
We bake him cookies
called Hello Dollies...

487
00:31:54,421 --> 00:31:56,589
...that he loves
and are easy to make.

488
00:31:56,882 --> 00:32:00,593
You get graham cracker crumbs,
sweetened condensed milk...

489
00:32:00,844 --> 00:32:03,388
...and all this other stuff,
and you bake them.

490
00:32:03,638 --> 00:32:05,806
But they're really good.

491
00:32:06,057 --> 00:32:08,767
" I like being a Secret Youth Adviser
to the President...

492
00:32:09,019 --> 00:32:12,480
...because it means I am helping
to run the country. The end."

493
00:32:15,108 --> 00:32:17,401
How dare you...

494
00:32:17,735 --> 00:32:20,070
...come up in front of the class...

495
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:23,949
...and make up lies
about our President?

496
00:32:24,408 --> 00:32:27,035
Absolutely wild.

497
00:32:27,661 --> 00:32:32,248
And I really dug the way
you used fantasy...

498
00:32:32,458 --> 00:32:33,458
...current events...

499
00:32:33,709 --> 00:32:38,129
...and cooking in a kind
of tapestry of storytelling.

500
00:32:38,589 --> 00:32:39,881
Thank you, Betsy.

501
00:32:40,132 --> 00:32:43,051
That was real special.
Thank you. Give her a hand.

502
00:32:43,343 --> 00:32:44,802
Thank you. Thanks.

503
00:32:50,892 --> 00:32:52,393
Got the cookies?

504
00:33:05,239 --> 00:33:07,407
I've been dreaming about these.

505
00:33:12,663 --> 00:33:13,663
What's that mean?

506
00:33:14,748 --> 00:33:15,748
Peace.

507
00:33:16,583 --> 00:33:17,542
Good.

508
00:33:18,085 --> 00:33:19,544
I mean...

509
00:33:20,045 --> 00:33:21,212
...groovy.

510
00:33:24,049 --> 00:33:25,175
Come on, Checkers.

511
00:34:38,245 --> 00:34:40,789
There's something different about you.

512
00:34:41,498 --> 00:34:43,416
Why aren't you wearing your glasses?

513
00:34:43,667 --> 00:34:45,627
Because I got contact lenses.

514
00:34:51,675 --> 00:34:53,676
-Looks cool!
-Thanks!

515
00:34:54,677 --> 00:34:55,552
Hi, Rose.

516
00:34:55,804 --> 00:34:58,473
It is imperative
that we put a freeze...

517
00:34:58,723 --> 00:35:01,684
...on nuclear weapons
of mass destruction.

518
00:35:03,936 --> 00:35:06,938
Yeah, I know what nyet, nyet means.

519
00:35:07,607 --> 00:35:09,650
Excuse me a moment, Leonid.

520
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:14,612
Settle down, Checkers.

521
00:35:15,364 --> 00:35:17,199
Hello, girls. How are you?

522
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:19,409
Are these what I think they are?

523
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:22,287
Nice to see you.

524
00:35:24,373 --> 00:35:27,209
You gotta try one of these cookies.

525
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:32,046
I assure you, there's nothing
like them in all the Soviet Union.

526
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:34,131
Go ahead.

527
00:35:37,177 --> 00:35:39,220
They're called Hello Dollies.

528
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,727
What are they?

529
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:50,105
What do you think, Leonid?

530
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:54,693
Hello Dollies, eh?

531
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,867
Hello, Dolly

532
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:05,203
Well, hello, Dolly

533
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:10,000
It's so nice to have you back
Where you belong

534
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:13,377
Sing something.

535
00:36:13,628 --> 00:36:17,548
You're looking swell, Dolly
I can tell, Dolly

536
00:36:18,466 --> 00:36:22,553
You're still glowing
You're still growing

537
00:36:22,804 --> 00:36:25,890
You're still going strong

538
00:36:29,977 --> 00:36:30,936
You know, girls...

539
00:36:31,187 --> 00:36:33,981
...l think your cookies
have just saved the world...

540
00:36:34,231 --> 00:36:36,608
...from nuclear catastrophe.

541
00:36:39,945 --> 00:36:42,363
There you go, Leonid.
Hello, Dolly.

542
00:36:42,906 --> 00:36:46,117
Golly gee, fellas

543
00:36:46,368 --> 00:36:49,913
I'll have another of those

544
00:37:36,041 --> 00:37:38,168
Come away with me.

545
00:37:39,002 --> 00:37:40,711
But what about Pat?

546
00:37:41,045 --> 00:37:42,963
She understands.

547
00:39:14,802 --> 00:39:16,136
Arlene, watch out!

548
00:39:20,474 --> 00:39:22,601
Oh, my God!
Are you all right?

549
00:39:22,976 --> 00:39:25,353
Quick, tell me what your name is!

550
00:39:26,188 --> 00:39:27,981
Rhoda Morgenstern.

551
00:39:30,525 --> 00:39:32,610
I am so embarrassed.

552
00:39:33,278 --> 00:39:36,155
-I don't think anyone saw.
-Freak!

553
00:39:46,874 --> 00:39:49,167
Has something been
on your mind lately?

554
00:39:52,046 --> 00:39:54,006
There isn't some deep feeling...

555
00:39:54,256 --> 00:39:57,050
...you need to confess
to your best and only friend?

556
00:39:57,301 --> 00:39:58,510
What are you talking about?

557
00:39:58,761 --> 00:40:00,470
-Just say it!
-Say what?

558
00:40:00,721 --> 00:40:02,556
Just say it, because I already know!

559
00:40:02,806 --> 00:40:04,891
All right, I love Dick!

560
00:40:13,817 --> 00:40:17,362
This is everything about him and us
since we first met.

561
00:40:19,656 --> 00:40:21,532
Here's me as his wife.

562
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:24,368
-It looks so real.
-Thank you.

563
00:40:26,788 --> 00:40:29,749
-This is cartoon Dick.
-It's cute. I like that one.

564
00:40:30,833 --> 00:40:32,960
This is our White House souvenir.

565
00:40:33,961 --> 00:40:36,379
Look, I found these
old magazine clippings...

566
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:38,840
...with stuff about him
when he was young.

567
00:40:39,216 --> 00:40:40,300
Look.

568
00:40:41,176 --> 00:40:43,845
He's way more distinguished now.

569
00:40:45,639 --> 00:40:49,559
A jury today convicted
G. Gordon Liddy and James McCord...

570
00:40:49,810 --> 00:40:53,521
... of eight counts, including burglary,
in the Watergate break-in.

571
00:40:53,772 --> 00:40:56,816
Enough already.
I am sick of Watergate.

572
00:40:57,067 --> 00:40:59,194
And I am sick
of Woodward and Bernstein.

573
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,154
Who are they?

574
00:41:01,362 --> 00:41:03,322
Snot-nosed
Washington Post reporters...

575
00:41:03,573 --> 00:41:05,825
...who are trying
to disgrace the President.

576
00:41:06,075 --> 00:41:07,701
Anybody want some more Jell-O?

577
00:41:07,994 --> 00:41:09,245
Yes, please. Here.

578
00:41:09,912 --> 00:41:10,829
Betsy, look.

579
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,581
One more question, Mr. Liddy.

580
00:41:13,207 --> 00:41:17,210
-The White House denied involvement.
-He's so familiar.

581
00:41:18,254 --> 00:41:19,838
It's that weird guy!

582
00:41:20,464 --> 00:41:23,174
-What was he doing at the White House?
-I don't know.

583
00:41:24,885 --> 00:41:26,469
Done! We're going upstairs.

584
00:41:27,012 --> 00:41:29,639
A spokesman for
the administration once again...

585
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:33,184
... denied any participation
in the Watergate burglary.

586
00:41:33,435 --> 00:41:37,021
President Nixon is said to be
in seclusion with advisers.

587
00:41:39,399 --> 00:41:41,067
It's starting.

588
00:41:47,115 --> 00:41:48,699
Goddamn it!

589
00:41:53,371 --> 00:41:55,206
Mr. President, this is Arlene.

590
00:41:57,708 --> 00:42:00,460
-Hello, Arlene.
-I'm not waking you, am l?

591
00:42:00,794 --> 00:42:02,587
I'm a night owl.

592
00:42:03,297 --> 00:42:05,257
What's the deal with
that Watergate thing?

593
00:42:05,507 --> 00:42:07,342
Do you know anything about it?

594
00:42:10,262 --> 00:42:13,640
No, no, absolutely nothing.
I don't know a thing.

595
00:42:13,890 --> 00:42:15,766
No way, José!

596
00:42:16,017 --> 00:42:17,810
Because I live in the Watergate...

597
00:42:18,144 --> 00:42:21,480
...and one time we saw
that Liddy guy there...

598
00:42:21,773 --> 00:42:25,860
...then we saw him at the White House,
and now he's gonna go to jail.

599
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:31,948
Is there something
I can do for you...

600
00:42:32,199 --> 00:42:33,783
... or your family?

601
00:42:35,286 --> 00:42:38,163
There must be something you desire.

602
00:42:40,541 --> 00:42:42,376
I have to go now. Good night.

603
00:42:45,129 --> 00:42:46,755
My sweet prince.

604
00:42:47,005 --> 00:42:48,589
I think he's a vampire.

605
00:42:49,216 --> 00:42:51,593
But he doesn't even have a tuxedo.

606
00:42:52,177 --> 00:42:54,846
Oh, Myrna, you are something.

607
00:42:55,096 --> 00:42:56,889
You are really something.

608
00:43:03,021 --> 00:43:05,773
Pat, will you stop snoring,
goddamn it!

609
00:43:06,024 --> 00:43:08,401
My head is about to explode!

610
00:43:10,653 --> 00:43:12,613
So you're the President's lawyer?

611
00:43:17,368 --> 00:43:19,453
Why does the President need a lawyer?

612
00:43:23,207 --> 00:43:25,751
Good question. I just....

613
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:28,754
I don't know.

614
00:43:33,216 --> 00:43:35,259
-It's you two.
-Mr. President.

615
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:38,804
The Attorney General is
waiting upstairs, sir.

616
00:43:39,055 --> 00:43:40,097
Didn't I fire him?

617
00:43:40,348 --> 00:43:41,724
It's the new one, sir.

618
00:43:52,985 --> 00:43:55,487
-We're here to walk Checkers.
-Oh, my goodness!

619
00:43:55,738 --> 00:44:00,325
I'm so busy that I sometimes forget
about the rest of God's creatures.

620
00:44:02,077 --> 00:44:04,871
Here. I'll be back after lunch.

621
00:44:18,551 --> 00:44:19,760
Look.

622
00:44:20,011 --> 00:44:22,138
We should leave a message for Dick.

623
00:44:22,430 --> 00:44:23,764
Like what?

624
00:44:29,437 --> 00:44:32,147
I think it's time
you told him how you feel.

625
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,484
I can't.

626
00:44:35,735 --> 00:44:38,988
Maybe he loves you too, but he
doesn't think you're interested.

627
00:44:42,783 --> 00:44:44,910
If you care for him at all...

628
00:44:45,577 --> 00:44:46,995
...you'll tell him.

629
00:44:50,457 --> 00:44:52,709
Okay, you just have to go first.

630
00:45:02,218 --> 00:45:03,510
Hi, Mr. President!

631
00:45:03,845 --> 00:45:05,721
This is Betsy and Arlene.

632
00:45:05,930 --> 00:45:10,142
We wanted to thank you for letting us
be your Secret Youth Advisers...

633
00:45:10,476 --> 00:45:13,729
...and for letting us walk Checkers...

634
00:45:13,938 --> 00:45:15,230
...and for....

635
00:45:17,983 --> 00:45:18,858
Well....

636
00:45:19,151 --> 00:45:21,569
I don't know what else for,
so here's Arlene.

637
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:24,947
She has something
very personal to tell you.

638
00:45:27,493 --> 00:45:28,827
I love you.

639
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:36,751
I know that you have a lot
of things on your mind...

640
00:45:37,002 --> 00:45:39,212
...because you're
the President and all.

641
00:45:41,881 --> 00:45:44,675
But I can't keep my feelings
inside any longer.

642
00:45:45,009 --> 00:45:47,094
I've never felt this way
about anyone...

643
00:45:47,345 --> 00:45:49,555
...not even about Bobby Sherman,
who I adore...

644
00:45:49,806 --> 00:45:52,808
...but now I realize that
that was just puppy love...

645
00:45:53,309 --> 00:45:54,643
...and this is the real thing.

646
00:45:54,894 --> 00:45:56,687
Hey, Checkers. Hi, sweetie.

647
00:45:56,937 --> 00:46:00,607
I realize you're married and that
we can never really be together...

648
00:46:00,983 --> 00:46:02,275
...but I'll love you forever.

649
00:46:02,526 --> 00:46:04,027
Good boy.

650
00:46:05,654 --> 00:46:06,780
Poo-poo.

651
00:46:07,614 --> 00:46:10,283
There's this song
by Olivia Newton-John...

652
00:46:10,742 --> 00:46:13,786
...that I think best describes
the way I feel about you.

653
00:46:15,122 --> 00:46:16,873
It goes like this:

654
00:46:18,667 --> 00:46:20,668
I love you

655
00:46:21,503 --> 00:46:23,921
I honestly love you

656
00:46:25,423 --> 00:46:28,300
You don't have to answer

657
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:31,762
I could see it in your eyes

658
00:46:32,221 --> 00:46:34,598
But it's coming from my heart

659
00:46:34,849 --> 00:46:38,560
And not my head

660
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:43,147
And then there was that time...

661
00:46:43,566 --> 00:46:45,776
...when you put your hand
on my shoulder...

662
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:50,530
...and I got this warm,
tingly feeling inside.

663
00:46:50,989 --> 00:46:54,200
And I knew, right then,
at that moment--

664
00:46:54,451 --> 00:46:56,160
They'll be back soon.

665
00:46:56,411 --> 00:46:58,829
You've been on
for 1 8 1 l2 minutes.

666
00:47:00,415 --> 00:47:02,333
I have to go now. Goodbye.

667
00:47:02,792 --> 00:47:04,668
I can't believe you were
talking that whole time.

668
00:47:04,919 --> 00:47:06,503
What did you say?

669
00:47:07,547 --> 00:47:08,589
Stuff.

670
00:47:09,090 --> 00:47:10,424
It's personal.

671
00:47:10,675 --> 00:47:12,426
I want to make sure it recorded.

672
00:47:15,763 --> 00:47:18,473
Hunt's link to Colson is a problem.

673
00:47:18,724 --> 00:47:20,433
I must've pushed fast-forward.

674
00:47:24,563 --> 00:47:27,524
We can arrange for Hunt
to disappear in Latin America.

675
00:47:27,775 --> 00:47:31,320
And we could always
un-disappear him if we want to.

676
00:47:35,699 --> 00:47:37,492
Get down off of me, Checkers.

677
00:47:37,701 --> 00:47:40,036
Get down off of me,
you piece of shit!

678
00:47:42,914 --> 00:47:47,334
So let me tell you something.
We are going to use any means.

679
00:47:52,173 --> 00:47:55,509
I just don't want this whole
fucking Watergate business...

680
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:56,886
...biting me in the ass!

681
00:47:57,136 --> 00:48:00,013
You know the goddamn Jews
are out to get me!

682
00:48:05,728 --> 00:48:07,771
I don't think
the President of the U.S....

683
00:48:08,022 --> 00:48:10,774
...should be recording
conversations like that.

684
00:48:16,488 --> 00:48:17,447
Make it 8:30.

685
00:48:17,697 --> 00:48:18,948
Okay, will do.

686
00:48:20,325 --> 00:48:21,451
Girls...

687
00:48:21,701 --> 00:48:23,577
...did Checkers do his business?

688
00:48:25,622 --> 00:48:27,165
-Excellent.
-Good, good.

689
00:48:27,415 --> 00:48:30,584
I hope you left me
some of those yummy cookies.

690
00:48:31,169 --> 00:48:32,378
Take care.

691
00:48:34,338 --> 00:48:36,006
We have to go.

692
00:48:38,426 --> 00:48:39,802
Oh, my stars!

693
00:48:54,691 --> 00:48:56,400
Sounds very important.

694
00:48:58,028 --> 00:48:59,279
It is.

695
00:49:00,989 --> 00:49:02,448
Mr. President?

696
00:49:03,283 --> 00:49:04,283
What is it, Bob?

697
00:49:04,534 --> 00:49:07,161
I was wondering if you had
that package ready for me...

698
00:49:07,412 --> 00:49:09,330
...to take home over the weekend?

699
00:49:10,456 --> 00:49:12,791
Yeah, the musical tapes.

700
00:49:14,877 --> 00:49:18,505
Bob and I are very big fans
of Guy Lombardo.

701
00:49:19,674 --> 00:49:21,467
I taped them myself.

702
00:49:21,926 --> 00:49:23,052
Let me know what you think.

703
00:49:23,302 --> 00:49:24,428
I will, sir.

704
00:49:29,183 --> 00:49:30,851
You were saying, Arlene?

705
00:49:32,644 --> 00:49:35,396
We don't think you've been
completely honest with us.

706
00:49:35,689 --> 00:49:39,776
If this is about
that Watergate nonsense...

707
00:49:40,235 --> 00:49:41,778
...let me say once again...

708
00:49:42,028 --> 00:49:44,446
...l had nothing to do with it, okay?

709
00:49:44,823 --> 00:49:48,284
It's a plot created
by my enemies to disgrace me!

710
00:49:48,535 --> 00:49:52,955
Those radical, muckraking bastards,
Woodward and Bernstein...

711
00:49:53,206 --> 00:49:54,457
...at The Washington Post!

712
00:49:54,707 --> 00:49:56,625
They're the liars here, you know!

713
00:49:56,959 --> 00:50:00,003
Always hiding behind
the goddamn First Amendment!

714
00:50:00,338 --> 00:50:01,839
Let me tell you something!

715
00:50:02,131 --> 00:50:05,217
It won't protect them from me!

716
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:10,430
Actually, it was just about the dog.

717
00:50:10,681 --> 00:50:13,058
You act like you like him...

718
00:50:13,267 --> 00:50:14,851
...but we don't think you do.

719
00:50:16,311 --> 00:50:17,603
What dog?

720
00:50:20,482 --> 00:50:24,152
Now that you mention it,
people are talking about Watergate...

721
00:50:24,361 --> 00:50:25,737
...and they say you lied.

722
00:50:25,987 --> 00:50:27,988
And I'm Jewish.

723
00:50:28,364 --> 00:50:29,698
I know.

724
00:50:30,742 --> 00:50:32,368
I had you checked out.

725
00:50:35,204 --> 00:50:38,749
There's probably more in there
than you know about yourselves.

726
00:50:41,085 --> 00:50:42,544
Even grades?

727
00:50:42,878 --> 00:50:44,337
Grades...

728
00:50:44,755 --> 00:50:47,591
...your parents' income tax returns...

729
00:50:48,425 --> 00:50:51,094
...overdue library books.

730
00:50:51,345 --> 00:50:53,763
The whole kit and caboodle.

731
00:50:56,683 --> 00:50:59,143
Is there stuff
about my father in there?

732
00:51:00,687 --> 00:51:01,521
Who was he?

733
00:51:01,771 --> 00:51:05,774
A lady's shoe salesman
at Garfinkle's or some such place.

734
00:51:06,026 --> 00:51:09,070
Got hit by a garbage truck
at the age of 24.

735
00:51:09,946 --> 00:51:12,239
Your mom never said
it was a garbage truck.

736
00:51:12,490 --> 00:51:15,492
Strictly small time.
Never amounted to much.

737
00:51:19,789 --> 00:51:21,832
Well, at least he wasn't a liar.

738
00:51:23,334 --> 00:51:25,043
We heard that tape!

739
00:51:25,336 --> 00:51:27,588
-What'd you hear?
-You kick Checkers!

740
00:51:27,796 --> 00:51:30,923
And you're prejudiced,
and you have a potty-mouth!

741
00:51:31,133 --> 00:51:33,385
You're a bad man!

742
00:51:33,635 --> 00:51:36,179
You stinking little idiots,
get out of here!

743
00:51:36,430 --> 00:51:38,598
And don't ever come back here again!

744
00:51:40,767 --> 00:51:43,019
You don't mess with the big boys!

745
00:51:47,565 --> 00:51:48,565
Wait!

746
00:51:50,485 --> 00:51:52,903
I would like to apologize
for his actions.

747
00:51:53,154 --> 00:51:55,072
He's been under
a lot of stress lately.

748
00:51:55,323 --> 00:51:58,701
It's too late. We're not friends
with him anymore, period!

749
00:51:58,951 --> 00:52:02,204
And if you stay,
you're just as bad as he is.

750
00:52:19,930 --> 00:52:21,139
Wait!

751
00:52:22,057 --> 00:52:24,058
It's gonna be okay.

752
00:52:24,267 --> 00:52:25,685
I hate Dick!

753
00:52:28,188 --> 00:52:30,523
It was stupid of me
to fall in love with Dick.

754
00:52:30,773 --> 00:52:32,316
What was I thinking?

755
00:52:32,984 --> 00:52:35,486
Dick just disgusts me now.

756
00:52:36,654 --> 00:52:38,155
You know, Arlene...

757
00:52:39,407 --> 00:52:41,200
...Dick meant a lot to me too.

758
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:42,742
But I've been thinking...

759
00:52:43,077 --> 00:52:45,329
...you can't let Dick run your life!

760
00:52:49,959 --> 00:52:51,543
Do you mind?

761
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:54,838
We're having a personal conversation.

762
00:53:40,048 --> 00:53:41,132
What happened?

763
00:53:41,383 --> 00:53:44,594
Larry wasn't at Jake's house.
Larry was at a porno movie.

764
00:53:46,388 --> 00:53:47,847
Hi, Daddy!

765
00:53:49,808 --> 00:53:51,100
Hi, girls.

766
00:53:51,351 --> 00:53:52,185
Would you mind going upstairs
for just a minute?

767
00:53:52,185 --> 00:53:53,894
Would you mind going upstairs
for just a minute?

768
00:53:57,106 --> 00:53:59,900
I don't understand
the title of that porno movie.

769
00:54:05,489 --> 00:54:06,907
" Deep throat" means...

770
00:54:07,158 --> 00:54:10,786
...when the woman puts
the man's penis in her mouth.

771
00:54:39,063 --> 00:54:40,606
Okay, what now?

772
00:54:42,984 --> 00:54:44,485
Prank phone calls?

773
00:54:45,653 --> 00:54:46,945
Okay, who?

774
00:54:49,073 --> 00:54:50,407
Miss Spinnler?

775
00:54:54,495 --> 00:54:55,871
Sean Freshman?

776
00:54:56,997 --> 00:54:59,207
No, we always do him.

777
00:55:03,378 --> 00:55:05,922
I know, I know! These guys!

778
00:55:07,382 --> 00:55:09,467
The " radical, muckraking bastards."

779
00:55:09,718 --> 00:55:11,052
Excusez-moi?

780
00:55:11,302 --> 00:55:14,805
These are the guys that are writing
all that stuff about Watergate.

781
00:55:17,475 --> 00:55:19,518
And this one's kind of hunky.

782
00:55:19,769 --> 00:55:20,644
Gross.

783
00:55:21,604 --> 00:55:23,772
Well, you liked Dick.

784
00:55:29,778 --> 00:55:31,196
Washington Post.

785
00:55:31,989 --> 00:55:34,282
I'm the daughter
of the British ambassador...

786
00:55:34,533 --> 00:55:38,536
...and I have some very important
information concerning Watergate...

787
00:55:38,787 --> 00:55:40,079
...for your newspaper.

788
00:55:40,831 --> 00:55:42,165
One moment.

789
00:55:42,874 --> 00:55:44,333
I'm on hold!

790
00:55:49,422 --> 00:55:50,256
Woodward.

791
00:55:51,049 --> 00:55:52,175
I can't. I can't.

792
00:55:57,096 --> 00:55:58,305
Who's this?

793
00:55:58,723 --> 00:56:01,475
I just told you. Bob Woodward.

794
00:56:03,102 --> 00:56:03,977
Good.

795
00:56:04,645 --> 00:56:06,146
We know things.

796
00:56:06,397 --> 00:56:08,148
What kind of things?

797
00:56:09,650 --> 00:56:10,901
About Dick.

798
00:56:11,819 --> 00:56:13,153
I mean, the President.

799
00:56:14,822 --> 00:56:15,781
On the record?

800
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:19,492
Can I use your name?

801
00:56:20,577 --> 00:56:22,537
They don't get that it's a joke!

802
00:56:22,871 --> 00:56:24,831
That just makes it funnier.

803
00:56:25,081 --> 00:56:28,000
Unless you go on the record
or have documentation....

804
00:56:30,879 --> 00:56:33,548
I have deadlines.
This is The Washington Post.

805
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:36,092
A documentation.
Like a piece of paper.

806
00:56:37,802 --> 00:56:39,470
We have a piece of paper.

807
00:56:39,721 --> 00:56:43,849
Hold on. We have a list of creeps.
We got it at the White House.

808
00:56:45,393 --> 00:56:46,936
A list of creeps?

809
00:56:47,770 --> 00:56:49,479
C-R-E-E-P.

810
00:56:52,024 --> 00:56:53,859
The Committee to Re-elect
the President.

811
00:56:54,109 --> 00:56:58,780
It's to Haldeman. It has a list
of names, amounts of money and dates.

812
00:57:00,365 --> 00:57:02,241
Go ahead. What do you have?

813
00:57:04,161 --> 00:57:07,122
It's Magruder, Barker, Brown....

814
00:57:21,385 --> 00:57:22,803
Can I help you?

815
00:57:23,429 --> 00:57:25,389
-I'm cool.
-I'm sorry, go ahead.

816
00:57:34,106 --> 00:57:35,565
Go away!

817
00:57:36,316 --> 00:57:37,316
Right.

818
00:57:37,568 --> 00:57:40,195
You actually have this document
in your possession?

819
00:57:40,445 --> 00:57:42,321
Yeah, it's sitting right here.

820
00:57:43,073 --> 00:57:45,033
But the only problem is that...

821
00:57:45,283 --> 00:57:50,037
...we drew all over it, and I dropped
my grilled cheese sandwich on it...

822
00:57:50,288 --> 00:57:51,914
...so it's kind of rank.

823
00:57:52,165 --> 00:57:54,583
Benji, stop it. Get off!

824
00:57:55,919 --> 00:57:58,796
Are you insane?
Or are your pants too tight?

825
00:57:59,297 --> 00:58:00,548
Who are you talking to?

826
00:58:00,798 --> 00:58:04,384
A source with proof that the Committee
to Re-elect the President...

827
00:58:04,635 --> 00:58:06,219
...paid off the Water--

828
00:58:06,804 --> 00:58:08,972
Paid off the Watergate burglars.

829
00:58:09,223 --> 00:58:11,808
And the White House knows about it.

830
00:58:16,105 --> 00:58:18,315
You can't have that conversation
on the phone!

831
00:58:18,565 --> 00:58:20,274
It's too dangerous!

832
00:58:20,525 --> 00:58:22,193
Arrange a meeting.

833
00:58:23,153 --> 00:58:24,571
Ow! That really hurt me.

834
00:58:24,821 --> 00:58:26,447
That really hurt me.

835
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:29,284
Could I meet you?

836
00:58:29,618 --> 00:58:31,828
We've been too permissive
with you, young man.

837
00:58:32,328 --> 00:58:35,038
From now on,
we're watching you like a hawk.

838
00:58:35,790 --> 00:58:37,249
Not around here.

839
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:39,710
Right, you're being watched.
I understand.

840
00:58:41,546 --> 00:58:43,714
There is an underground
parking garage...

841
00:58:43,714 --> 00:58:44,631
There is an underground
parking garage...

842
00:58:46,133 --> 00:58:49,344
...on A Street and York Avenue.

843
00:58:49,762 --> 00:58:50,929
Across from Garfinkle's.

844
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:53,348
We can go shopping after we meet them.

845
00:58:54,433 --> 00:58:58,019
I can meet you there tomorrow at 9 p.m.

846
00:59:00,856 --> 00:59:01,856
How will I know you?

847
00:59:02,941 --> 00:59:05,234
That's for me to know
and you to find out.

848
00:59:09,573 --> 00:59:10,949
What are you staring at?

849
00:59:11,199 --> 00:59:13,075
There's yelling.
Are you in trouble?

850
00:59:15,954 --> 00:59:19,165
Give me a name, so when you call next,
I'll know it's you.

851
00:59:22,794 --> 00:59:23,961
Deep Throat!

852
00:59:24,712 --> 00:59:25,796
Deep Throat!

853
00:59:27,089 --> 00:59:29,466
Carl Bernstein.
Tell me your story.

854
00:59:29,717 --> 00:59:30,968
Up yours, man!

855
00:59:32,845 --> 00:59:35,639
Deep Throat! Come here,
Deep Throat boy!

856
00:59:38,934 --> 00:59:40,185
They hung up.

857
00:59:40,435 --> 00:59:42,228
-What're you doing?
-It's cool.

858
00:59:42,479 --> 00:59:44,188
-What are you doing?
-Helping you out.

859
00:59:44,856 --> 00:59:46,565
I swear to God...!

860
00:59:50,737 --> 00:59:52,196
You're horny!

861
01:00:03,332 --> 01:00:05,500
All right, he's not here. Let's go.

862
01:00:12,091 --> 01:00:13,884
You're Deep Throat?

863
01:00:15,552 --> 01:00:17,011
We both are.

864
01:00:17,262 --> 01:00:18,596
How old are you?

865
01:00:19,681 --> 01:00:20,765
23.

866
01:00:21,016 --> 01:00:22,559
Is that your combined ages?

867
01:00:23,894 --> 01:00:25,770
There's no need to be snotty.

868
01:00:26,021 --> 01:00:29,190
I'm just trying to imagine here,
what exactly...

869
01:00:29,441 --> 01:00:31,901
...is your connection
with the White House?

870
01:00:32,152 --> 01:00:34,445
We were the Secret Youth Advisers.

871
01:00:34,696 --> 01:00:38,115
And we walked the dog.
And Arlene was in love with Dick.

872
01:00:38,366 --> 01:00:41,410
Okay, I don't need to hear
any more of that, really.

873
01:00:43,621 --> 01:00:44,621
Were you followed?

874
01:00:51,504 --> 01:00:53,797
What are you doing here?

875
01:00:54,048 --> 01:00:55,757
I came to make sure
you were all right.

876
01:00:56,008 --> 01:00:57,551
You did not!

877
01:00:57,801 --> 01:00:59,594
You're trying to horn in on my source.

878
01:00:59,845 --> 01:01:03,431
How come you get to meet Deep Throat?
I'm the one who saw that movie.

879
01:01:04,808 --> 01:01:06,184
Hi, I'm Carl Bernstein.

880
01:01:06,435 --> 01:01:09,479
-You're supposed to check phone records.
-It gave me a headache.

881
01:01:09,729 --> 01:01:11,397
-Stop whining.
-I'm not whining.

882
01:01:11,648 --> 01:01:13,524
Yes, you are. You're whining.

883
01:01:13,775 --> 01:01:15,610
We've talked about this.

884
01:01:16,111 --> 01:01:17,862
Are you interested in the story or not?

885
01:01:25,661 --> 01:01:28,205
At first, we thought he was really nice.

886
01:01:28,456 --> 01:01:33,002
Then we heard him saying mean things
about Jews and using foul language.

887
01:01:33,252 --> 01:01:34,753
We realized he was a jerk.

888
01:01:35,004 --> 01:01:36,296
A jerk.

889
01:01:36,547 --> 01:01:38,924
We could hear him kicking the dog
on the tape.

890
01:01:39,174 --> 01:01:40,133
There's a tape?

891
01:01:40,384 --> 01:01:43,094
He records everything. It's in
Rose Mary's desk. He's paranoid.

892
01:01:43,345 --> 01:01:45,013
What else did he say on this tape?

893
01:01:45,263 --> 01:01:46,806
They talked about hiding...

894
01:01:47,182 --> 01:01:50,893
...some guy in South America
because he knew about Watergate.

895
01:01:51,144 --> 01:01:54,855
Let me get this straight. You're saying
the President of the United States--

896
01:01:55,106 --> 01:01:57,107
-Of America.
-Of America...

897
01:01:57,358 --> 01:02:01,028
...the most powerful country
in the world...

898
01:02:01,904 --> 01:02:04,281
...is involved
in this Watergate cover-up?

899
01:02:04,532 --> 01:02:05,658
-Yeah.
-I guess.

900
01:02:05,992 --> 01:02:08,035
Who is he talking to on this tape?

901
01:02:09,287 --> 01:02:10,538
Erlichman?

902
01:02:11,330 --> 01:02:12,581
Hurlichman.

903
01:02:13,165 --> 01:02:15,792
-No, there isn't a Hurlichman.
-Yes, there is.

904
01:02:16,043 --> 01:02:17,377
There's not a Hurlichman.

905
01:02:17,711 --> 01:02:20,547
There's a Haldeman.
And there's an Erlichman.

906
01:02:21,048 --> 01:02:21,965
Wait, wait, wait.

907
01:02:22,216 --> 01:02:24,384
The guy who's, like, kind of fleshy...

908
01:02:24,635 --> 01:02:27,929
...who wears horn-rimmed glasses
and a cheesy dark suit.

909
01:02:28,221 --> 01:02:29,221
It sounded like him.

910
01:02:31,016 --> 01:02:32,559
Show me which one.

911
01:02:35,937 --> 01:02:38,481
I never realized how much
they all look alike.

912
01:02:41,067 --> 01:02:44,904
The document you mentioned on the phone,
it was written to Haldeman?

913
01:02:45,154 --> 01:02:47,823
If we publish that, we could nail him.

914
01:02:48,074 --> 01:02:50,117
Give me skin, Daddy.

915
01:02:53,245 --> 01:02:55,455
We don't really have it right now.

916
01:02:55,664 --> 01:02:56,498
What?

917
01:02:57,666 --> 01:02:59,250
The dog ate it.

918
01:02:59,626 --> 01:03:00,877
The dog ate it.

919
01:03:03,922 --> 01:03:07,592
Great. You know, I don't need this.
I went to Yale.

920
01:03:09,010 --> 01:03:09,844
Sorry.

921
01:03:11,179 --> 01:03:13,514
We could've gotten grounded
for sneaking out.

922
01:03:13,765 --> 01:03:15,641
If we could get that tape....

923
01:03:15,892 --> 01:03:17,560
But it's in the White House.

924
01:03:17,811 --> 01:03:21,898
You know who else I think is sexy
is Robert Plant, from Led Zeppelin.

925
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:24,608
He reminds me of my brother.

926
01:03:30,406 --> 01:03:33,408
Your brother's not that bad.
Not that I like him.

927
01:03:33,743 --> 01:03:36,370
I can't run this. You don't have it.

928
01:03:36,620 --> 01:03:37,746
What?

929
01:03:38,747 --> 01:03:42,542
I might be willing to take the risk
on these other names...

930
01:03:42,793 --> 01:03:44,461
...but not on Haldeman. My God!

931
01:03:44,711 --> 01:03:48,839
He's the man who controls access
to the leader of the free world.

932
01:03:49,341 --> 01:03:50,842
There is another source.

933
01:03:51,092 --> 01:03:54,637
You mean, your what-do-you-call-it?

934
01:03:54,888 --> 01:03:55,722
Hand Job.

935
01:03:56,264 --> 01:03:57,431
Deep Throat.

936
01:03:57,682 --> 01:04:01,352
Yeah, Deep Throat.
Well, tell me about Deep Throat.

937
01:04:01,686 --> 01:04:05,272
Well, " he" Iinks the President...

938
01:04:05,523 --> 01:04:06,440
...to the burglary...

939
01:04:06,691 --> 01:04:08,400
...and to a cover-up.

940
01:04:08,651 --> 01:04:09,777
Jesus!

941
01:04:10,653 --> 01:04:12,154
What branch is he in?

942
01:04:13,614 --> 01:04:14,948
Executive.

943
01:04:15,199 --> 01:04:16,450
How high?

944
01:04:16,700 --> 01:04:17,826
About yea high.

945
01:04:18,953 --> 01:04:20,537
Don't do this to me.

946
01:04:20,829 --> 01:04:23,498
Get some more sources on those names.

947
01:04:23,790 --> 01:04:27,460
Bring me in some hard evidence
and nail it down.

948
01:04:28,170 --> 01:04:31,256
Some people think
that Mick Jagger's lips are gross.

949
01:04:31,506 --> 01:04:33,299
But I think that they're sexy.

950
01:04:33,550 --> 01:04:36,469
They're like this big couch
made out of skin.

951
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:38,972
You're so hard rock now.

952
01:04:42,725 --> 01:04:43,642
What?

953
01:04:43,893 --> 01:04:47,646
That van's been right behind us
since we left school. Don't look.

954
01:04:47,897 --> 01:04:49,189
I have to.

955
01:04:56,614 --> 01:04:58,282
-We're being followed.
-By who?

956
01:04:58,532 --> 01:05:00,325
I don't know.
Do you think it's Dick?

957
01:05:00,576 --> 01:05:04,121
Maybe he knows we talked to
the " radical, muckraking bastards."

958
01:05:04,371 --> 01:05:05,872
He couldn't know.

959
01:05:06,123 --> 01:05:07,499
He could.

960
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:11,836
Dick frightens me.

961
01:05:13,004 --> 01:05:14,422
Hello, this is Bob Woodward.

962
01:05:14,714 --> 01:05:16,549
And Carl Bernstein, Washington Post.

963
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:20,803
Carl's on the other line. We have
a few questions we'd like to ask you.

964
01:05:21,054 --> 01:05:22,722
Girls! Arlene, Betsy!

965
01:05:22,972 --> 01:05:24,181
We can't talk now.

966
01:05:24,432 --> 01:05:28,811
We need to know some names from
that list you had. Do you remember any?

967
01:05:29,061 --> 01:05:31,313
We're under a lot of pressure too.

968
01:05:31,564 --> 01:05:34,149
It's okay.
You don't have to name any names.

969
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:35,859
-Don't answer.
-We'll say names.

970
01:05:36,110 --> 01:05:39,613
We'll count to 1 0. If you don't
hang up, that's a confirmation.

971
01:05:40,197 --> 01:05:41,323
What?

972
01:05:43,409 --> 01:05:45,327
I'm so sorry to interrupt you.

973
01:05:45,577 --> 01:05:47,453
-Go!
-Just go with it!

974
01:05:49,665 --> 01:05:52,167
I asked you to come to dinner
1 5 minutes ago.

975
01:05:52,417 --> 01:05:54,085
Now your TV dinners are ice-cold.

976
01:05:54,336 --> 01:05:56,254
In fact, they're frozen again.

977
01:05:56,546 --> 01:05:58,005
McCord.

978
01:06:00,842 --> 01:06:01,676
Lang.

979
01:06:01,926 --> 01:06:05,637
So come to the table now, or I'll never
fix you dinner again, ever!

980
01:06:05,888 --> 01:06:06,722
Seven...

981
01:06:06,931 --> 01:06:07,931
...eight...

982
01:06:08,349 --> 01:06:09,183
...nine...

983
01:06:09,559 --> 01:06:10,893
We'll be right there, Mom.

984
01:06:13,062 --> 01:06:13,896
...ten.

985
01:06:14,438 --> 01:06:16,106
Thank you very much.

986
01:06:22,821 --> 01:06:24,239
They hung up.

987
01:06:26,617 --> 01:06:28,201
I'm sorry, Janet.

988
01:06:28,452 --> 01:06:29,494
You all right?

989
01:06:54,935 --> 01:06:57,103
You scared us to death!
What's the matter?

990
01:06:57,354 --> 01:07:00,106
You little lying sacks of shit
are the matter!

991
01:07:00,691 --> 01:07:01,525
Listen!

992
01:07:06,155 --> 01:07:09,866
You guys gave us bad information
on the phone.

993
01:07:10,617 --> 01:07:12,452
The names on the list?

994
01:07:13,078 --> 01:07:16,205
We printed it, they denied it,
and our other source backed out!

995
01:07:16,456 --> 01:07:19,250
Now everybody thinks
that I'm a schmuck!

996
01:07:20,376 --> 01:07:21,502
What names?

997
01:07:21,753 --> 01:07:23,588
The names! The information!

998
01:07:23,838 --> 01:07:25,881
Listen, people are counting on you!

999
01:07:26,215 --> 01:07:30,302
You're big-shot reporters. Can't you
figure anything out for yourselves?

1000
01:07:30,553 --> 01:07:33,097
How could you let your dog
eat that list?

1001
01:07:33,347 --> 01:07:34,890
You're ruining my life!

1002
01:07:37,643 --> 01:07:41,605
We have a very important report
on turquoise jewelry due in two days...

1003
01:07:41,855 --> 01:07:44,899
...and we can't find books on it,
and the President is having us followed.

1004
01:07:45,150 --> 01:07:48,611
-It's too much pressure.
-Just leave us alone!

1005
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:07,338
I'm in here, dear.

1006
01:08:07,588 --> 01:08:09,589
How come you're home so early?

1007
01:08:09,841 --> 01:08:11,050
Honey...

1008
01:08:12,093 --> 01:08:13,719
...l've met someone.

1009
01:08:14,261 --> 01:08:15,970
I've met someone.

1010
01:08:16,222 --> 01:08:17,348
Here he is.

1011
01:08:18,891 --> 01:08:20,392
Hello, Arlene.

1012
01:08:23,228 --> 01:08:24,520
How did you know my name?

1013
01:08:27,191 --> 01:08:28,817
It's embroidered on your blouse.

1014
01:08:43,873 --> 01:08:45,958
It's really so funny how we met.

1015
01:08:46,209 --> 01:08:51,005
I was in the market at lunch and we
literally just crashed into each other.

1016
01:08:51,255 --> 01:08:56,009
I said, " Excuse me, your peanut butter
is in my chocolate."

1017
01:08:58,596 --> 01:09:02,391
And I said, "Your chocolate
is in my peanut butter."

1018
01:09:05,018 --> 01:09:06,978
We haven't been separated
since then.

1019
01:09:07,229 --> 01:09:10,065
Well, until I used the bathroom
just now.

1020
01:09:13,402 --> 01:09:16,154
Roderick, you're such a treasure.

1021
01:09:23,203 --> 01:09:25,455
Honey, did you leave the door open?

1022
01:09:35,881 --> 01:09:37,340
We've been robbed.

1023
01:09:40,886 --> 01:09:43,013
My grandmother's pearls!

1024
01:09:43,973 --> 01:09:45,432
My stash!

1025
01:09:50,437 --> 01:09:53,648
Are you absolutely positive
nothing is missing?

1026
01:09:55,025 --> 01:09:56,943
I don't understand it at all.

1027
01:09:57,194 --> 01:10:01,698
My jewelry case wasn't touched,
but they ripped apart the sofa cushions.

1028
01:10:01,948 --> 01:10:03,282
I need a drink.

1029
01:10:03,533 --> 01:10:06,660
Maybe they just didn't like
my wife's taste in decorating.

1030
01:10:09,455 --> 01:10:12,582
If I didn't know better, I'd say
someone was looking for something.

1031
01:10:12,834 --> 01:10:16,337
-I can't imagine what.
-We're just a normal family.

1032
01:10:16,587 --> 01:10:18,630
Okay, I wouldn't go that far.

1033
01:10:25,721 --> 01:10:28,014
They only stole
the Hello Dollies recipe.

1034
01:10:28,265 --> 01:10:31,351
Not jewelry or the TV
or Larry's pot or anything.

1035
01:10:31,602 --> 01:10:33,145
It's too much of a coincidence.

1036
01:10:33,395 --> 01:10:36,814
Your house gets robbed, and my mom
gets a boyfriend the same night?

1037
01:10:37,357 --> 01:10:38,608
Why don't you like him?

1038
01:10:38,858 --> 01:10:42,903
Because I think he's a spy for Dick.
No guy like that would go for my mom.

1039
01:11:31,409 --> 01:11:34,036
I'll buzz you up
so that my mom doesn't hear.

1040
01:11:40,292 --> 01:11:40,709
Betsy, what're you doing?

1041
01:11:40,709 --> 01:11:42,210
Betsy, what're you doing?

1042
01:11:43,337 --> 01:11:45,297
-We're being bugged!
-What?

1043
01:11:45,798 --> 01:11:48,967
The President of the United States
is bugging our houses...

1044
01:11:49,218 --> 01:11:51,011
...and spying on us!

1045
01:11:52,512 --> 01:11:54,221
What did you just say?

1046
01:11:57,934 --> 01:11:59,810
It's a line from a song.

1047
01:12:00,061 --> 01:12:02,062
We're being bugged

1048
01:12:02,647 --> 01:12:03,522
The White House

1049
01:12:06,067 --> 01:12:09,737
There's a man from The Washington Post
on the phone for you.

1050
01:12:15,910 --> 01:12:18,037
It's Carl Bernstein from The Post.

1051
01:12:18,287 --> 01:12:19,621
The information you gave--

1052
01:12:20,539 --> 01:12:22,916
We're not interested
in a subscription.

1053
01:12:23,167 --> 01:12:24,042
Thanks, no.

1054
01:12:24,668 --> 01:12:27,462
No, we prefer the news on TV.
Thank you.

1055
01:12:28,756 --> 01:12:31,049
I thought we already got The Post.

1056
01:12:32,426 --> 01:12:35,512
You know, there is something
very strange going on here.

1057
01:12:35,762 --> 01:12:36,804
I know there is.

1058
01:12:37,556 --> 01:12:40,058
And I don't want to know
what it is. Okay?

1059
01:12:43,311 --> 01:12:46,272
And in all my years of public life,
I can say...

1060
01:12:46,523 --> 01:12:50,360
... that I have
never, ever obstructedjustice.

1061
01:12:50,902 --> 01:12:52,611
This is all his fault.

1062
01:12:53,404 --> 01:12:56,490
The people have got to know...

1063
01:12:56,866 --> 01:12:59,618
... whether or not
their President is a crook.

1064
01:13:00,786 --> 01:13:02,120
Well...

1065
01:13:02,371 --> 01:13:03,413
...l'm not a crook.

1066
01:13:03,664 --> 01:13:05,874
He's trying to drive me insane.

1067
01:13:17,385 --> 01:13:18,260
Oh, my God!

1068
01:13:18,512 --> 01:13:20,221
We have to get out of here!

1069
01:13:24,267 --> 01:13:26,227
-Oh, my God!
-It's okay.

1070
01:13:37,613 --> 01:13:38,572
Go!

1071
01:13:49,208 --> 01:13:50,667
Oh, my God!

1072
01:14:06,516 --> 01:14:10,019
So these girls are a threat
to national security?

1073
01:14:10,895 --> 01:14:12,896
According to the President.

1074
01:14:14,565 --> 01:14:18,068
How dare those people keep treating us
like stupid teenage girls!

1075
01:14:18,402 --> 01:14:20,820
We are stupid teenage girls.

1076
01:14:21,072 --> 01:14:23,657
No, Betsy, we're human beings.

1077
01:14:23,908 --> 01:14:26,076
And we're American citizens.

1078
01:14:26,535 --> 01:14:30,080
And fourscore and seven years ago,
our forefathers...

1079
01:14:30,747 --> 01:14:32,540
...did something.
I don't know what.

1080
01:14:32,916 --> 01:14:36,085
But I do know one thing:
Dick's ass is grass.

1081
01:14:36,336 --> 01:14:38,963
Where are we going?
What are we doing?

1082
01:14:39,214 --> 01:14:42,008
If Haldeman has the tapes
that Woodward and Bernstein want...

1083
01:14:42,259 --> 01:14:43,968
...we're gonna find them.

1084
01:14:45,220 --> 01:14:47,305
This is it.
This is Haldeman's house.

1085
01:14:47,555 --> 01:14:48,764
21 70.

1086
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:56,229
Look, there's somebody there.

1087
01:14:59,317 --> 01:15:01,110
Haldeman must have a son.

1088
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:03,111
Wait, let me see.

1089
01:15:04,697 --> 01:15:05,531
We have a mission.

1090
01:15:05,781 --> 01:15:09,326
We have to figure out a way
to get inside and find those tapes.

1091
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:12,955
Don't worry, Arlene.

1092
01:15:13,455 --> 01:15:14,831
I'll do it.

1093
01:15:25,967 --> 01:15:27,009
Do you remember me?

1094
01:15:29,929 --> 01:15:31,305
Betsy, right.

1095
01:15:31,723 --> 01:15:33,141
From the Homecoming dance.

1096
01:15:33,766 --> 01:15:34,641
Right.

1097
01:15:47,279 --> 01:15:48,238
Want to make out?

1098
01:15:48,489 --> 01:15:49,406
Sure.

1099
01:16:17,433 --> 01:16:18,934
Are you all right?

1100
01:16:19,518 --> 01:16:20,518
Fine.

1101
01:16:21,979 --> 01:16:24,981
I need to go to the bathroom.
Will you excuse me?

1102
01:17:34,424 --> 01:17:36,384
What's going on here?

1103
01:17:37,135 --> 01:17:38,469
Beer bong?

1104
01:17:39,929 --> 01:17:42,264
I'm tripping heavily already.

1105
01:17:59,906 --> 01:18:01,115
You know....

1106
01:18:04,077 --> 01:18:05,745
I really like you.

1107
01:18:06,788 --> 01:18:08,247
Don't talk to me.

1108
01:18:09,249 --> 01:18:10,291
Kiss me.

1109
01:18:47,911 --> 01:18:49,329
Anybody home?

1110
01:18:58,379 --> 01:19:00,506
Oh, my God, it's so terrible.

1111
01:19:00,798 --> 01:19:02,925
-Dean's leaving.
-Jesus!

1112
01:19:04,593 --> 01:19:05,927
He's leaving, all right.

1113
01:19:06,178 --> 01:19:09,639
Dean's a team player.
He's not gonna cave in like that.

1114
01:19:09,974 --> 01:19:12,101
No, I just don't believe it.

1115
01:19:12,351 --> 01:19:14,811
You better! It'll be
in the paper tomorrow.

1116
01:19:15,062 --> 01:19:17,606
I talked to Dean,
and he said it was true.

1117
01:19:17,856 --> 01:19:21,734
It's happening. It's happening.
It's real, man.

1118
01:19:22,235 --> 01:19:24,820
Well, I guess...

1119
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:27,031
...the shit's hitting the fan now?

1120
01:19:27,282 --> 01:19:29,617
Damn right it's hitting the fan.

1121
01:19:35,248 --> 01:19:36,082
What's the matter?

1122
01:19:36,290 --> 01:19:38,417
Something's in my ass.

1123
01:19:41,504 --> 01:19:42,713
Am I bleeding?

1124
01:19:43,214 --> 01:19:44,548
You're fine.

1125
01:19:45,299 --> 01:19:49,010
Figures that the pain in my ass
is Nixon, the fascist.

1126
01:19:49,929 --> 01:19:51,638
He's your dad's boss.

1127
01:19:52,348 --> 01:19:54,349
My dad's an arms manufacturer.

1128
01:19:55,017 --> 01:19:56,643
Aren't you Haldeman's son?

1129
01:19:57,227 --> 01:19:58,728
No. That's Brad.

1130
01:19:58,979 --> 01:20:00,647
I'm his roommate at school.

1131
01:20:00,897 --> 01:20:02,815
He's at the dermatologist.

1132
01:20:03,066 --> 01:20:04,567
But this is his house, right?

1133
01:20:05,860 --> 01:20:07,486
Yeah. What the hell's going on?

1134
01:20:07,737 --> 01:20:09,363
Did we meet before or not?

1135
01:20:10,907 --> 01:20:12,116
So you don't remember?

1136
01:20:12,575 --> 01:20:14,785
I remember like it was yesterday.

1137
01:20:16,287 --> 01:20:17,538
That's funny...

1138
01:20:18,247 --> 01:20:19,915
...because we never met.

1139
01:20:21,083 --> 01:20:22,209
What?

1140
01:20:23,044 --> 01:20:26,338
I just saw you on the street
and thought you were cute.

1141
01:20:26,797 --> 01:20:27,714
Really?

1142
01:20:34,346 --> 01:20:35,638
You're hot.

1143
01:20:35,889 --> 01:20:37,056
Thanks.

1144
01:20:38,809 --> 01:20:40,268
Liddy says...

1145
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:42,103
...that these prisons are....

1146
01:20:42,562 --> 01:20:44,397
They're like Club Med...

1147
01:20:44,648 --> 01:20:46,149
...just like Club Med.

1148
01:20:46,399 --> 01:20:47,441
Well, I have...

1149
01:20:47,901 --> 01:20:51,112
...a particularly incriminating tape
I brought home.

1150
01:20:51,362 --> 01:20:53,238
I should give that a listen.

1151
01:20:53,907 --> 01:20:56,576
Sure. Yeah, I'll say hi to the wife.

1152
01:20:56,826 --> 01:20:59,912
-Take care.
-Okay. You take care too.

1153
01:21:20,807 --> 01:21:22,558
Sorry, Mr. Haldeman.

1154
01:21:23,185 --> 01:21:24,686
That's okay, Chip.

1155
01:21:25,270 --> 01:21:26,229
Who is this?

1156
01:21:26,479 --> 01:21:28,022
This is Betsy, sir.

1157
01:21:42,828 --> 01:21:43,954
Wait a minute.

1158
01:21:45,122 --> 01:21:46,289
I know you.

1159
01:21:47,166 --> 01:21:48,125
You're one of those dog--

1160
01:21:52,546 --> 01:21:54,047
Shit!

1161
01:21:58,468 --> 01:22:00,177
Come back here, you little bitches!

1162
01:22:21,032 --> 01:22:22,116
It's not right.

1163
01:22:22,366 --> 01:22:24,284
Sources are sources.
Just because--

1164
01:22:24,535 --> 01:22:26,370
How goes it, paperboys?

1165
01:22:27,246 --> 01:22:28,372
Not too good.

1166
01:22:28,622 --> 01:22:30,373
Well, your luck's about to change.

1167
01:22:30,624 --> 01:22:34,919
The President knew about it for sure,
for absolute sure.

1168
01:22:35,921 --> 01:22:36,880
That's the tape.

1169
01:22:37,131 --> 01:22:38,090
It's the tape.

1170
01:22:38,340 --> 01:22:40,383
We finally have goods on Dick.

1171
01:22:42,886 --> 01:22:44,512
Tricky Dick's going down.

1172
01:22:45,722 --> 01:22:50,309
It's unethical to take possession
of the tape if it's stolen, but--

1173
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:53,479
You can't have it anyway.
It's our only souvenir.

1174
01:22:54,689 --> 01:22:57,983
But we copied it down.
Thirty words a minute.

1175
01:22:58,234 --> 01:22:59,610
I passed typing.

1176
01:23:00,778 --> 01:23:03,530
A lot of people want to know
who our source is.

1177
01:23:03,781 --> 01:23:04,781
Really?

1178
01:23:05,199 --> 01:23:06,325
We'll be famous.

1179
01:23:06,575 --> 01:23:09,285
But we've decided
never to reveal your identity.

1180
01:23:09,870 --> 01:23:11,204
For our own protection?

1181
01:23:14,249 --> 01:23:16,459
It's just too embarrassing.

1182
01:23:16,752 --> 01:23:18,545
Dick's going down.

1183
01:23:19,922 --> 01:23:21,965
Dick is going down!

1184
01:23:38,731 --> 01:23:40,858
In a series of events
that rocked the nation...

1185
01:23:41,109 --> 01:23:43,152
... the White House accepted
the resignations...

1186
01:23:43,444 --> 01:23:46,321
... of Presidential Counsel John Dean....

1187
01:23:47,239 --> 01:23:52,160
I can't believe this Watergate business
runs so high up.

1188
01:23:53,787 --> 01:23:56,247
You have no idea.

1189
01:23:57,249 --> 01:23:59,250
I realized one day...

1190
01:24:00,460 --> 01:24:02,336
... that if I stayed...

1191
01:24:03,130 --> 01:24:06,383
...l'd be just as bad as he was.

1192
01:24:37,162 --> 01:24:41,374
I'd say these people are gonna
cost a million dollars...

1193
01:24:41,625 --> 01:24:43,168
... over the next two years.

1194
01:24:44,628 --> 01:24:46,379
We can get that.

1195
01:24:46,671 --> 01:24:50,508
You can get a million dollars
and you can get it in cash.

1196
01:24:50,759 --> 01:24:53,386
I know where it could be gotten.

1197
01:24:55,346 --> 01:24:56,263
I love you

1198
01:24:56,264 --> 01:24:56,806
I love you

1199
01:24:57,974 --> 01:25:00,226
I honestly love you

1200
01:25:01,686 --> 01:25:03,896
What in the bejesus is that?

1201
01:25:11,821 --> 01:25:14,657
I can't keep my feelings inside
any longer.

1202
01:25:15,115 --> 01:25:17,075
I've never felt this way
about anybody...

1203
01:25:17,326 --> 01:25:21,163
-...not even Bobby Sherman....
-A 1 5-year-old.

1204
01:25:21,538 --> 01:25:22,789
Oh, Jesus!

1205
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:25,250
And that this is the real thing.

1206
01:25:26,585 --> 01:25:29,045
Watergate, my ass!

1207
01:25:29,421 --> 01:25:31,881
They'll crucify me if they hear this.

1208
01:25:32,340 --> 01:25:33,924
Checkers, shut up!

1209
01:25:34,384 --> 01:25:37,053
Or I'll feed you to the Chinese!

1210
01:25:37,679 --> 01:25:39,430
Erase this shit.

1211
01:25:43,309 --> 01:25:45,102
What's that smell?

1212
01:25:47,396 --> 01:25:49,147
Hello Dollies!

1213
01:25:49,398 --> 01:25:51,274
Where'd you get the recipe?
It was stolen.

1214
01:25:51,692 --> 01:25:54,819
It's on the label
of every can, lamebrain.

1215
01:25:55,529 --> 01:25:56,821
Except...

1216
01:25:57,281 --> 01:26:00,117
...for one special Larry Jobs addition.

1217
01:26:03,245 --> 01:26:05,872
I keep them mixed up with the walnuts.

1218
01:26:08,416 --> 01:26:11,210
You said these were
just walnut leaves.

1219
01:26:11,670 --> 01:26:12,879
I lied.

1220
01:26:13,338 --> 01:26:15,590
But the President ate those.

1221
01:26:15,924 --> 01:26:18,009
Right, your pal, Tricky Dick.

1222
01:26:18,259 --> 01:26:19,927
No, really.

1223
01:26:22,722 --> 01:26:25,432
Maybe that's why he's so paranoid.

1224
01:26:32,440 --> 01:26:33,357
It's happening.

1225
01:26:33,607 --> 01:26:35,525
-What?
-Come on.

1226
01:26:38,404 --> 01:26:41,990
Throughout the long and difficult
period of Watergate...

1227
01:26:42,574 --> 01:26:46,077
...l have felt it was my duty
to persevere...

1228
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:50,498
... to make every possible effort
to complete the term of office...

1229
01:26:50,749 --> 01:26:52,667
... to which you elected me.

1230
01:26:52,959 --> 01:26:54,627
But as President...

1231
01:26:55,420 --> 01:26:58,756
...l must put the interest
of America first.

1232
01:27:00,383 --> 01:27:01,634
Therefore...

1233
01:27:02,635 --> 01:27:05,345
...l shall resign the Presidency...

1234
01:27:05,638 --> 01:27:08,223
... effective at noon tomorrow.

1235
01:27:09,016 --> 01:27:11,893
Vice President Ford will be
sworn in at that hour...

1236
01:27:12,144 --> 01:27:15,021
-It's gonna be different now.
-... in this office.

1237
01:27:16,023 --> 01:27:17,649
They'll never lie to us again.

1238
01:27:17,650 --> 01:27:18,192
They'll never lie to us again.

1239
01:27:31,329 --> 01:27:34,039
Isn't it against the law
to cut up the flag?

1240
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,085
Not if you sew it back together.

1241
01:29:24,897 --> 01:29:28,150
We look so fantastic.

1242
01:29:41,162 --> 01:29:42,121
We gotta hurry!

1243
01:30:09,773 --> 01:30:10,690
Look!

1244
01:30:10,941 --> 01:30:13,318
You suck, Dick!

1245
01:30:21,826 --> 01:30:24,078
Bye, Tricky Dick!

1246
01:30:25,078 --> 01:30:35,078
