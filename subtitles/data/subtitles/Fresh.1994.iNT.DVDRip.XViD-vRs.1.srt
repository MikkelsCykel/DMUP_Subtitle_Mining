<i>Buenos dias, buenos dias.</i>

2
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:56,578
<i>You coming early today.
I'm almost not finish.</i>

3
00:01:56,649 --> 00:01:59,447
<i>But don't worry,
I'm finish.</i>

4
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:01,578
I gotta get to school.

5
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:05,215
Come in, come in.

6
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:09,523
Always with you young boys,
always in a rush, always in a rush.

7
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:24,472
Marisol already
leave for school.

8
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:27,479
She has not missed one day
of school in three year.

9
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:30,414
Sit down, sit down.

10
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:33,919
You like some milk?
Some milk and cookie?

11
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,922
I have some nice
chocolate chip.

12
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,584
You like Marisol?

13
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:42,651
Marisol, she always
asking about you:

14
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:47,689
<i>Why he don't talk to me
at the school?"</i>

15
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:50,827
<i>You have a girlfriend?</i>

16
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:54,135
Ahhh, you already
liking somebody.

17
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:58,735
You are young.
Is plenty of time.

18
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:03,748
Soon you get tired of her,
and then you talk to my Marisol.

19
00:03:03,816 --> 00:03:08,753
And I'm always telling her,

20
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:15,156
So take your time.
It's okay. "

21
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:19,460
Because I always tell her a word

22
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:23,468
<i>- Half a brick means 20,
- Yes, yes, of course, 20.</i>

23
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:27,973
- It ain't 20.
- Yes, yes, of course, 20.

24
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:32,410
Esteban said I gotta take this to
Chillie's store. I gotta take 20.

25
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:36,073
If I don't give him 20, he gonna
get mad. You want me to count 'em?

26
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:38,117
No, no, no, no.
Wait, wait.

27
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:41,210
I- I-I check for you.
I- I check again.

28
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:55,225
Oh, look, look.
This one was stuck in back here.

29
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:58,498
I don't understand.
It's my eyes, you know?

30
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:01,768
So old, not seeing
so good no more.

31
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:05,208
And that's why I buy Marisol
her glasses right away.

32
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:08,304
So she don't have no trouble
with her eyes like me.

33
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:13,318
But Marisol is a pretty girl.
Just think about my Marisol...

34
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:18,153
<i>because I want her to have a clever
boy like you, so you think about it,</i>

35
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:28,125
Yeah, yeah,
they already called.

36
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:30,226
Then why they ain't
ready yet?

37
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:34,637
Relax. It's 8:00 in the morning.
We ain't hardly woke up yet.

38
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:37,301
<i>I'm late for school,</i>

39
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:42,337
Oh, for joy! It's little Fresh,
our messenger to the gods.

40
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:45,248
My tag is for my friends.
You can call me Michael.

41
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:47,252
You know,
it's embarrassing...

42
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,289
<i>Esteban using this ugly
little maricon for man's work.</i>

43
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:52,256
It makes me sick.

44
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:54,919
What's embarrassing is,
all the work there is to do...

45
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:58,623
Esteban got you workin' up here with
the bitches, that's what's embarrassing.

46
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:03,260
Damn! Ugly spotted little
motherfucker. I'll fuck you up.

47
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:08,296
I'm all over these bitches, nigger. Got me
a harem here like Arabian motherfuckin' shit.

48
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:10,569
You ain't all over me,
motherfucker.

49
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:13,771
You be dead before you touch
this good thing, fucking monkey.

50
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:16,110
<i>You tripping on
your own shit, motherfucker,</i>

51
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:19,777
Only harem you playin' is them five
fingers on your own fuckin' hand.

52
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:23,015
<i>- That's right,
I need five bricks, Five,</i>

53
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:25,489
Everybody know
the only reason he here...

54
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:28,493
is 'cause Esteban skied
on his freakin' sister.

55
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:31,428
Don't be talkin' about my sister.

56
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:34,557
<i>Word, Esteban clockin'out
on that chocolate freak,</i>

57
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:36,727
<i>He doggin'her
every chance he get...</i>

58
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:39,738
<i>and she ain't nothing but a hop-head
freak riding the white horse-</i>

59
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:42,536
Say one more word
about my sister, bitch.

60
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:45,042
<i>You know, maricon,
I'm gonna fuck you right up.</i>

61
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:48,239
Do it. Come on, bitch.
Fuck me up.

62
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:51,249
<i>You know you ain't
fuckin'nobody up, Herbie...</i>

63
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:53,649
<i>so shut the fuck up,</i>

64
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,087
I need five bricks. Five.

65
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:15,266
<i>Chillie, man, they're all there,
I already counted 'em,</i>

66
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:17,434
You know
I got to count 'em.

67
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:21,173
You don't get paid 'til they're
all counted and accounted for.

68
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:26,015
What, you got ants
in your pants?

69
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:29,179
Chill, homes.
Esteban wants to talk to you anyway.

70
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:32,281
I gotta get to school, Chillie.
I'm stupid late.

71
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:34,292
It's gonna be my second
late day this week.

72
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,294
Man, Miss Coleman's
gonna kill me.

73
00:06:36,362 --> 00:06:38,956
Don't worry. I'll write you
a doctor's note.

74
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:43,728
Yo, it ain't funny, man.

75
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:46,533
Esteban comin' here
just to talk to me?

76
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:48,540
He's making the rounds.

77
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:51,372
But he said he wants you to wait
for him 'til he gets here, okay?

78
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:53,571
Kick it, Chillie.
Pay me later.

79
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:56,080
I'm crazy late.
Tell him I had to get to school.

80
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:59,084
Yo, yo, Fresh.
Come back here, crimey.

81
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:06,250
Here. Here, homes.

82
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:09,658
If there's anything missing,
I'll kill you later.

83
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:14,161
<i>Well?</i>

84
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:17,628
Did you bring a late pass
or didn't you?

85
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:21,298
Boy, who's talking to you,
me or that floor?

86
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:29,781
Is this a comedy act, Chuckie?
You find this funny?

87
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:33,785
<i>Then shut up and wipe
that stupid-looking thing...</i>

88
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:36,549
<i>which you probably think
is some kind of charming expression...</i>

89
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:39,819
<i>right off your face, boy,</i>

90
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:45,092
<i>Put your things away
and find a seat,</i>

91
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:48,133
<i>Go on!</i>

92
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:51,136
This is not over,
do you hear me?

93
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:55,903
<i>Now, what I was saying
before that interruption...</i>

94
00:07:55,975 --> 00:08:00,173
<i>was that Mr, Hill told you what
the words "manifest destiny"means...</i>

95
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:03,010
<i>but not what it was,</i>

96
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:06,245
<i>So don't come into my classroom
with that ignorant nonsense...</i>

97
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,413
<i>about the heroes of the Alamo
and Davy Crockett...</i>

98
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,650
<i>and how bad they were...</i>

99
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:13,919
<i>because all
they were really doing...</i>

100
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:16,826
<i>was robbing another people
of their land...</i>

101
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:21,856
<i>so that they could keep opening up
new territories for legal slavery,</i>

102
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:26,371
<i>The papers that I gave you
have a series of quotes...</i>

103
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:29,897
<i>from some antislavery writers
of that time period,</i>

104
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:32,035
<i>You read the first quote, Rosie,</i>

105
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:35,877
<i>It's from an antislavery writer
by the name of David Child...</i>

106
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:39,042
<i>written to
the Mexican government...</i>

107
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:42,212
<i>warning them about his own
United States government,</i>

108
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:44,222
<i>Read it to the class,</i>

109
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:48,317

an impatient and almost ir-</i>

00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:54,366
<i>to lay hold on Texas-"</i>

112
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:56,560
<i>Excuse me,</i>

113
00:08:56,636 --> 00:09:00,402
Where do you think you are,
the land of Oz?

114
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:04,569
<i>You must be trippin'if you two
think you're gonna sit together,</i>

115
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:08,444
<i>Boy, move over there,
Go on, Rosie,</i>

116
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,454
All right, Curtis, you're
hogging the ball again. Pass it.

117
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:41,038
<i>Power!</i>

118
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,794
Power!

119
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:29,957
That's it.
Yo, that shit's mine.

120
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:32,862
Not with a prayer, nigger.
That's it.

121
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:36,129
- That shit's mine This is mine.
- Look, look, nigger.

122
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:39,137
- Yeah, that's mine. That's right.
- Shit.

123
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:40,934
Step right up,
step right up.

124
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:42,941
One more, my good man.
One more.

125
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:44,943
Only if you flip
Willie Randolph.

126
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:47,775
- Uh-uh. Sorry, G.
- Yo, forget it, then.

127
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:51,112
Yo, I gave my last Willie Randolph
double to Fresh in class, man.

128
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:54,380
- I only got one left.
- Flip Willie Randolph!

129
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:57,445
No! N-O spells no.
No one never flips him.

130
00:10:57,523 --> 00:11:00,321
And it be costing me
six bucks of packs 'til I get him.

131

<i>Always be trippin', Walkin' with

155
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:27,812
<i>Word, they think they all that, but
they just want you to smack they head,</i>

156
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:35,748
Oh.

157
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:39,416
<i>Where you goin', man?

159
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:08,749
Yo, Rosie, stop looking at me, all right?
Why you always lookin' at me?

160
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:12,450
- 'Cause you look at me so much, I can't help it.
- I don't look at you.

161
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:16,461
- You do. You're always lookin' at me.
- You trippin'.

162
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:20,761
You drag all your friends into our cheerleading
practice like it's all their idea...

163
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:23,768
but you bring 'em

164
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:26,566
- You stupid trippin'.
- It's all right. I think it's cute.

165
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,735
Girls always be sayin', "Mikey got
them spotty white spots on him. "

166
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:34,075
But I think it's cute, I do.

- My mother is white.

169
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:43,454
- Get outta here.
- She is. Straight up white.

170
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:46,013
Why she never come
to school, then?

171
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:49,026
She don't want you
'cause you're black, right?

172
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:51,756
- Why don't you live with your mother?
- I do.

173
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:54,766
You live with your aunt, with Hilary

She's got a big house.

178
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,810
Near as big
as this whole school.

179
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:13,613
You gotta go through a gate and drive
through a whole forest just to get to it.

180
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,950
- What kind of car she drive?
- A sports car.

181
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:18,854
- What kind of sports car?
- I don't know. AJaguar.

182
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:23,190
If I had me a million dollars,
I'd get me a Porsche 959.

183
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:26,129
I'd get me a sports car.
AJaguar.

184

seconds, so don't even talk.</i>

188
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:41,877
Yeah, well, who cares, 'cause you ain't
never gonna have a million dollars anyway.

189
00:14:41,947 --> 00:14:44,848
- I will too!
- Who's trippin' now?

190
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:48,250
Ain't nobody trippin'.

Someday, I'm gonna have it.

192
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:04,088
Hi, Grandma.

00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:15,433
Yo, what up?

00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:21,439
<i>Why is everybody out here?</i>

00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,171
We just here.

196
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:36,687
<i>What a place to spend
our last night on earth,</i>

197
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:46,230
What up, y'all?

198
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:47,697
Hey.

199
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:49,893
Where Aunt Francis at?

00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:55,239
Yo, why everybody

202
00:17:57,976 --> 00:18:00,069
Yo, I got winners.

203
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:26,666
<i>Michael?
You're home,</i>

204
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:32,042
<i>Look, Nichole,
Your brother's here,</i>

205
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:35,479
Hey, Nicky.

206
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:41,585
I know Michael wants you to come
back and stay with us for a while.

207
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:44,952
Look, Aunt Francis, I just came
to get a few of my things.

208
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:46,957
I'm not staying.

209
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:50,961
Michael, you want Nicky
to stay with us, don't you?

210
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,528
<i>Can't sleep here no more,</i>

211
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:59,537
There's like a thousand little girls
running in and out of here.

212
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:03,632
Like my feet are hanging off
the edge of the bed already.

213
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:07,406
I know it.
I know it's crowded in here.

214
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:12,473
And you being a grown woman
and all. Nicky, take my bed.

215
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:16,647
Doesn't matter to me. I can sleep
in here with the girls for a while.

216
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:19,088
Aunt Francis,
I don't want your bed.

217
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,364
Well...

218
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:32,301
I guess I'll leave you alone
with your brother for a while.

219
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:36,467
<i>Maybe he can talk to you about
staying with us a little longer,</i>

220
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:41,036
Michael ain't no one
to talk to nobody about nothin'.

221
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:45,216
<i>I gotta go,</i>

222
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:15,644
<i>- Michael?
- What?</i>

223
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,739
Why you come home so late?

224
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:20,842
You know Aunt Francis be gettin'
worried when you come home so late.

225
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:25,288
It's hard enough on her without
you be worryin' her all the time.

226
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:30,294
If she gets too fed up and gives
all of us up, I'm gonna kill you.

227
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:33,263
<i>'Cause ain't none of us
can go back to our parents...</i>

228
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:36,392
<i>and I ain't goin' back to
no group home, you hear me?</i>

229
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:39,437
You my cousin and all,

230
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:44,237
but if you ruin it
for the rest of us, I'm gonna kill you.

231
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:58,172
- What up, G?

232
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:01,617
- Get you two bottle, homes.

233
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:04,281
You tried all the rest;

234
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:07,450
Are you sure? I mean,
you know it for a fact, right?

235
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:09,551
Bust it, you don't like it,

236
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:12,290
Jake give you back your ten
dollars, send you on your way.

237
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:16,300
Just don't be comin' back here

No way five dollars, man. Last time

Yo, Consuelo,

245
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:10,120
<i>Five dollars a pop,</i>

Look, maybe I better talk

249
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:26,136
You know you don't be talkin'

Look, you tellJake that

<i>- Sorry, all right?
- Yeah, you be sorry.</i>

289
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:04,189
You do that shit,
just do it in front of my face.

290
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:10,100
Now, am I free to finish my
little transaction here...

291
00:26:10,168 --> 00:26:14,264
without every nigger be doin'
some shit behind my back?

292
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:19,208
Niggers be dissin' you
at every turn, homes.

293
00:26:19,277 --> 00:26:23,941
It's all right, 'cause
you my stand-up little G.

294
00:26:24,015 --> 00:26:25,949
Yeah.

295
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:30,249
And, uh, I'll be talkin' toJake
about his temper too.

296
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:33,382
It's one hundred dollars.

297
00:26:36,461 --> 00:26:39,055
Niggers be gettin'
$50 for lookout.

298
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:43,066
I be runnin' that rock all day.
One hundred dollars.

299
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:50,237
- You one bad
motherfucker, crimey.

300
00:26:50,308 --> 00:26:54,244
Only reason you ain't the man
is you still too goddamn little.

301
00:26:54,312 --> 00:26:58,271
But you get bigger,
you gonna be the man.

302
00:27:58,576 --> 00:28:01,374
Oh, man!

303
00:28:04,082 --> 00:28:08,712
I shake on a game, Fishcake.
That wasn't no game.

304
00:28:12,323 --> 00:28:15,258
<i>All right.</i>

305
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:18,591
<i>Who's next, who's next?</i>

306
00:28:18,663 --> 00:28:22,064
Come on. I heard there was
players in this shit hole.

307
00:28:22,133 --> 00:28:24,761
All I see is chumps.

308
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:27,771
Come on. Who's gonna
give me a game?

309
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:31,100
Come on.
Get outta here.

310
00:28:31,176 --> 00:28:33,701
<i>I ain't got time
for this shit,</i>

311
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:42,219
All right.

312
00:28:49,961 --> 00:28:53,795
<i>Play.</i>

313
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:14,151
<i>Check,</i>

314
00:29:16,821 --> 00:29:18,584
Mate in four.

315
00:29:18,656 --> 00:29:22,615
Fuck you. Ain't no mate
in no four. Fuck you.

316
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:32,766
Would've been four
if you were smart. Mate.

317
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,470
Shit.

318
00:29:54,025 --> 00:29:56,960
That shit over there
was a waste of time.

319
00:29:57,028 --> 00:30:00,794
Fished me a twenty, Dad. You don't
be pulling 'em in for no twenties.

320
00:30:00,865 --> 00:30:03,390
Said it was a waste of time.
Time ain't money...

321
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:07,734
no matter what those morons who eat that
kind of shit up may try and tell you.

322
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:10,639
Anything lost can be found again,
except for time wasted.

323
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:14,109
- It was fun, Dad, stupid fun. You seen
that nigger- - Chess ain't fun, boy.

324
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:18,343
How many times I gotta tell you that?
Don't you listen to a word I say?

325
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:22,614
- Maybe if I seen you more.
- Well, you don't, so you'd be well served...

326
00:30:22,687 --> 00:30:26,088
to retain some of the knowledge
I'm impartin' to you...

327
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:29,354
rather than giving me all your
hard-ass street-attitude bullshit.

328
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:34,597
Ain't so much fun now, is it?

329
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:37,134
Gettin' to be less and less fun
every second here.

330
00:30:37,202 --> 00:30:39,762
<i>Uh-uh, think about it,</i>

331
00:30:43,408 --> 00:30:46,036
Forget the clock
for a second, Michael.

332
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:51,480
What kind of player am I? Am I an
offensive man or a defensive man?

333
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:54,017
That's right; I'm neither.
I play my opponent.

334
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:57,020
If he likes to attack,
I force him to defend himself.

335
00:30:57,088 --> 00:31:00,023
If he's a cautious man,
I draw him into dangerous waters.

336
00:31:00,091 --> 00:31:02,025
See, you get so frustrated
playing defensive positions...

337
00:31:02,093 --> 00:31:04,618
you make stupid moves you'd
never make if you were thinkin'.

338
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:07,392
When you come here, boy,
check that shit at the door.

339
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,964
That's good.
That's better.

340
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:19,169
I'm still gonna kick your ass,
but that's better.

341
00:31:21,913 --> 00:31:24,473
You been playin'
on the team?

342
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:28,876
<i>No, huh?</i>

343
00:31:28,953 --> 00:31:31,581
Just watchin' the world
pass you by.

344
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:35,092
Figure as long as you ain't drownin',
everything's all right.

345
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:39,496
I don't need
no punk school team.

346
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:45,969
Mate.

347
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:57,443
And he got Hulk number one
and all them Thors.

348
00:31:57,515 --> 00:31:59,608
My old man
got all them comic books.

349
00:31:59,684 --> 00:32:02,778
He showed 'em to me, and they
were like all stupid number ones.

350
00:32:02,854 --> 00:32:05,618
- Yo, he got Superman number one?
- Yeah, he got that.

351
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:07,624
He got Action Comics
number one?

352
00:32:07,692 --> 00:32:10,456
Word, he got that too.
He got all them number ones.

353
00:32:10,528 --> 00:32:14,123
Where he be keepin' 'em at?
In his garage with all them limos?

354
00:32:14,198 --> 00:32:17,133
- You know you ain't got no old man.
- I do so.

355
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:20,466
Then we'll call him up when we get to
my house. We be givin' the nigger a call.

356
00:32:20,538 --> 00:32:22,597
- He don't answer no phones.
- And why not?

357
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:24,835
He don't want no po' niggers
wastin' his time.

358
00:32:27,211 --> 00:32:30,237
Bam, Spiderman goes down.
Bam, Daredevil goes down.

359
00:32:30,315 --> 00:32:33,751
All them niggers is goin' down.
Punisher be takin' they ass out.

360
00:32:33,818 --> 00:32:37,447
- X-Men take out the Punisher.
- X-Man baby stuff, homes.

361
00:32:37,522 --> 00:32:41,754
All their costumes and powers ain't
shit. Punisher the real dope, homie.

362
00:32:41,826 --> 00:32:44,693
Word, I seen a seven-foot-tall
White Terminator nigger...

363
00:32:44,762 --> 00:32:46,923
with 20 guns on my roof
just the other day.

364
00:32:46,998 --> 00:32:49,432
Punisher be takin' out
all your stupid heroes.

365
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,934
He be sayin', Bam! Bam! Bam!
Bam! Take out that nigger!

366
00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:56,303
<i>Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!
Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!</i>

367
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:02,107
Yo, Fresh, I been training him.
Watch this.

368
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:04,341
Good boy, Roscoe.
Good boy.

369
00:33:04,415 --> 00:33:07,350
Good boy? That dog
ain't nothin' but badness.

370
00:33:07,418 --> 00:33:09,648
Ain't nothin' but badness.

371
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:14,283
What up, Roscoe? You miss me?
You miss your homie?

372
00:33:20,531 --> 00:33:23,967
<i>Okay, okay, Mama,
I'll be in in a minute, all right?</i>

373
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:26,663
I'm gonna fight him
on Sunday.

374
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:30,071
<i>- You gonna do what?
- Roscoe's gonna take on Ricardo's pit,</i>

375
00:33:30,141 --> 00:33:32,234
Roscoe ain't fightin'
nobody's nothin'.

376
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:34,403
<i>My dog fight
when I say he fight,</i>

377
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:36,811
He ain't your dog.
He's our dog; I found him.

378
00:33:36,881 --> 00:33:40,578
Ain't nobody askin' you, homes.
I'm gonna get paid, bust it.

379
00:33:40,651 --> 00:33:44,348
You already gettin' stupid paid,
workin' them jobs for Esteban and shit.

380
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:48,085
Yo, we see y'all later.
We gotta go.

381
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:51,318
Well, I ain't gotta go.

382
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:55,094
You always be lookin'
all ratty and shit...

383
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:57,430
but everybody know
you gettin' paid.

384
00:33:57,502 --> 00:34:00,938
Yo, why you always
be lookin' nappy like that?

385
00:34:01,005 --> 00:34:03,439
What you be doin'
with all that jack?

386
00:34:03,508 --> 00:34:05,942
You be hidin'
that shit away, right?

387
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:10,447
Damn, when I get paid, I'm gonna get
me those dope new Nikes, like ten pairs.

388
00:34:10,515 --> 00:34:13,450
And I'm gonna get me some
stupid gold, homes, crazy gold.

389
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:16,453
Like this tooth right here
and a five-finger gold ring...

390
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:20,617
- with my tag bustin' all out that motherfucker.
- You ain't got no tag.

391
00:34:20,691 --> 00:34:23,956
- I will when I get paid.
- He ain't fightin'.

392
00:34:24,028 --> 00:34:28,124
Then you gonna take me to get a
job for Esteban? Yo, man, why not?

393
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:31,726
'Cause you be actin' like a
stupid little kid, that's why not.

394
00:34:31,803 --> 00:34:35,170
Yo, why you dissin' me, man? I'm crazy,
homie. I'll bust those dope moves.

395
00:34:37,308 --> 00:34:41,244
<i>Come on, Rudy, Get it in your
mouth, Don't be such a spaz,</i>

396
00:34:41,312 --> 00:34:44,577
- Don't be talkin' like that to your son, Esteban.
- Hey, chill, woman.

397
00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:47,311
He knows I'm only messin' with him.
Right, baby?

398
00:34:47,385 --> 00:34:49,979
You know Daddy's
messin' with you.

399
00:34:50,054 --> 00:34:52,249
Sure you don't want
no eats?

400
00:34:52,323 --> 00:34:54,348
My grandma
be cookin' at home.

401
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:58,953
You're a good boy, Fresh.
You be eating at home.

402
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:02,488
And you be running to school
when I want to talk to you.

403
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:06,799
That's okay, little homie.
I like me a smart G. I really do.

404
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:10,307
You seem to have
enough time on your hands...

405
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:14,470
to be runnin' those rocks
for Corky's boys, though.

406
00:35:14,545 --> 00:35:17,514
What, you think I got no eyes
but these two in my own head?

407
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:19,914
I know where you be at.

408
00:35:19,984 --> 00:35:22,612
Corky got that work.

409
00:35:22,687 --> 00:35:27,351
I be runnin' for you once a week,
maybe twice if somebody else gets sick.

410
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:29,689
Corky got them jobs.

411
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,785
Hey, let me tell you
something, Fresh.

412
00:35:31,863 --> 00:35:34,661
Now, you're a smart kid, so you
hear these words of wisdom.

413
00:35:34,732 --> 00:35:37,064
You know,
that rock is a bad move.

414
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:40,593
You start messin' with that
shit- sellin', dealin'-

415
00:35:40,671 --> 00:35:44,505
I guarantee inside three,
five years, you'll be dead.

416
00:35:44,575 --> 00:35:47,373
Or you'll have
a bullet in your head.

417
00:35:47,445 --> 00:35:50,175
Or that pipe in your mouth.
Either way, you're dead.

418
00:35:50,248 --> 00:35:54,742
Smack is the way to go.
This is a gentleman's operation.

419
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:58,255
The clientele is stable,
peace-loving.

420
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:01,086
The competition
is unconfrontational.

421
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,593
And the heat,
they mostly let it slide...

422
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:06,061
'cause there's little hassle
all the way around.

423
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:09,759
You find your niche,
you stay there, you stay cool...

424
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:14,703
and you be the man
into your 50's and 60's.

425
00:36:14,772 --> 00:36:19,266
And then you retire your old ass
to a nice condo someplace hot...

426
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:22,107
with a lot of
niceJewish people.

427
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,341
Leave the business for your kids.

428
00:36:24,415 --> 00:36:28,112
Hey, it's like banking,
only it's more secure.

429
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:31,553
And you don't pay no taxes.

430
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:39,028
Hey, what are you doing? You ain't
holding her right. Come here, come here.

431
00:36:39,096 --> 00:36:42,224
I'm trying to feed her,
in case you haven't noticed.

432
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:45,736
No, you ain't holding her right.
She ain't hungry.

433
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:53,703
<i>Hey, come on,</i>

434
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:56,076
I'm gonna put her to bed.

435
00:37:01,786 --> 00:37:05,586
You know, I ain't never sold no
rock, and no kind of coke whatsoever.

436
00:37:05,656 --> 00:37:10,593
I never even tried it. Don't come near
that shit, not even from curiosity.

437
00:37:10,661 --> 00:37:13,596
Close the door, okay?

438
00:37:26,177 --> 00:37:28,441
It got loose on my last run.

439
00:37:28,512 --> 00:37:31,037
I didn't want to give it
to no one but you.

440
00:37:31,115 --> 00:37:34,050
Hey, my little money man.

441
00:37:34,118 --> 00:37:37,645
Hey, you just lost Chillie
a hundred bucks on a bet, G...

442
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:40,589
<i>'cause he don't know you
like I do,</i>

443
00:37:40,658 --> 00:37:42,888
Hey, you my solid little man.

444
00:37:51,302 --> 00:37:55,398
Most niggers, they be givin'
their bitches rocks, you know?

445
00:37:55,473 --> 00:37:57,737
Watchin' them pop off.
Bang!

446
00:37:57,808 --> 00:38:00,470
They got theyself
a Action Jackson bitch.

447
00:38:00,544 --> 00:38:03,479
<i>Jumpin'around like a rabbit,
Divin'for that dick...</i>

448
00:38:03,547 --> 00:38:07,108
<i>like it's gold at the end of the
rainbow, you know what I mean?</i>

449
00:38:07,184 --> 00:38:09,744
Hey, not me, little homie.

450
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:14,257
No, no, no, no, not me.
No, I love me a straight bitch.

451
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:17,590
Maybe she like to slide
into the land of"H"...

452
00:38:17,662 --> 00:38:20,756
every once in a while,
a regular bitch.

453
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,801
Maybe she fine, like a-

454
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:29,431
<i>Ay carajo,
like your sister.</i>

455
00:38:29,507 --> 00:38:32,533
<i>Hey,your sister, she fine,</i>

456
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:35,408
<i>And then she take her hit...</i>

457
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:39,381
<i>and, like,
her eyes they roll back...</i>

458
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:42,044
and she get suddenly soft.

459
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:45,054
Oh, so soft and pure.

460
00:38:45,122 --> 00:38:48,057
And I am holding
my very own virgin.

461
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:51,561
My Madonna.
Hey, I take that.

462
00:38:51,629 --> 00:38:54,223
<i>You know I take that,</i>

463
00:38:55,966 --> 00:38:57,866
Is your sister a freak?

464
00:39:00,404 --> 00:39:03,396
Hey, come here.
Hey, sit down.

465
00:39:06,977 --> 00:39:10,071
<i>Now, I'm askin' you a question.
Is she a freak?</i>

466
00:39:10,147 --> 00:39:12,411
Man, you married.

467
00:39:12,483 --> 00:39:17,420
Hey, I know you're just a kid,
Fresh, even though you're smart.

468
00:39:17,488 --> 00:39:20,924
So I let you talk to me
like that just this one time.

469
00:39:20,991 --> 00:39:24,586
But you tell me- You better
tell me who she's runnin' with.

470
00:39:24,662 --> 00:39:27,597
- Nobody.
- Don't fuck with me, little homie!

471
00:39:27,665 --> 00:39:30,691
Serious, my aunt won't
let her out with nobody.

472
00:39:30,768 --> 00:39:33,032
You know,
I find that hard to believe.

473
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:36,505
Bitch as fine as that.
She always has somebody.

474
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:40,032
Word, but my aunt won't
let her out with nobody.

475
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:44,411
I hope you're right, little homie.
I hope you're right.

476
00:39:58,796 --> 00:40:02,732
<i>Okay, come on, Let's go,</i>

477
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:07,904
I gotta see Nichole.

478
00:40:07,972 --> 00:40:10,907
Yeah?
Who the fuck are you?

479
00:40:10,975 --> 00:40:14,069
Her brother.
I gotta see her.

480
00:40:17,648 --> 00:40:21,084
I got a kid down here
say he Nichole's brother.

481
00:40:21,152 --> 00:40:25,248
Send him up.
- One flight up.

482
00:40:25,322 --> 00:40:29,019
Use the stairway at the back of
the store. There's only one door.

483
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:35,057
So, you Michael.

484
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:42,765
I guess you used up
all the ugly in the family.

485
00:40:44,508 --> 00:40:47,773
Keep hearin' you the little man
runnin' the street.

486
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:51,508
You the little man
runnin' the street?

487
00:40:51,582 --> 00:40:55,416
Shit, next thing I know
niggers in diapers...

488
00:40:55,486 --> 00:40:59,616
packin' tech-nines be tryin'
to take over my business.

489
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:05,795
I said put me down!
Put me down!

490
00:41:05,863 --> 00:41:08,627
She's in there.

491
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:11,600
Esteban looking for you.

492
00:41:13,404 --> 00:41:15,463
Good for Esteban.

493
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:19,173
Yo, why you stay with James?

494
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:28,741
You know why, Fresh.

495
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:31,583
Why?

496
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:37,318
'Cause his smack is the dope
and he got plenty of it.

497
00:41:37,394 --> 00:41:40,158
<i>You happy now?</i>

498
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:42,392
Why you don't go
to Esteban, then?

499
00:41:48,739 --> 00:41:51,003
I don't like the way
he looks at me.

500
00:41:53,377 --> 00:41:58,314
<i>I don't need no spic pimp motherfucker
lookin' at me like I'm no fucking queen.</i>

501
00:42:02,486 --> 00:42:05,478
I'm just a sorry-ass
nigger ho'.

502
00:42:05,556 --> 00:42:10,619
<i>James here, he looks at me like
I'm nothing, so I'm down withJames,</i>

503
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:12,321
You ain't
ain't nothin'.

504
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:20,068
Michael, fuck off,
all right?

505
00:42:20,137 --> 00:42:23,903
Don't Aunt Francis think you ain't
nothin'. She think you somethin'.

506
00:42:23,974 --> 00:42:27,432
Aunt Francis
is a fuckin' saint.

507
00:42:30,447 --> 00:42:35,646
Aunt Francis loves every damn dog in
the street the same as she loves me.

508
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:39,052
Ain't no shit to be loved
by no fuckin' saint.

509
00:42:41,859 --> 00:42:43,793
I love you.

510
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:52,365
I got him.
Come on now.

511

- Yo, what's up, nigger?
- He ain't got nothin'.

513
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:03,179
<i>Watch him, watch him,</i>

514
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:05,681
Aw, shit, he finally

Curtis bad, homes.
He be bustin' out those moves!

516

517
00:43:11,455 --> 00:43:14,083
<i>He ain't doin'shit,
Come on,</i>

518
00:43:14,158 --> 00:43:17,093
What's up, shorty?
Come on, come on.

519
00:43:17,161 --> 00:43:20,096
<i>- Damn!

520
00:43:20,164 --> 00:43:22,223
Man, you pick him up,

521
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:27,529
Yo, Fresh, other court's open.
Let's shoot some hoops.

522
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,732
No, not right now, man.

523
00:43:33,644 --> 00:43:37,102
You just don't want me
embarrassin' your ass...

524
00:43:37,181 --> 00:43:39,479
in front of none
of them bitches, huh?

525
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:41,814
Yo, don't be

<i>Foul, motherfucker!

531
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:02,605
<i>Hey, man,you okay?</i>

Man, fuck you, nigger! Little
motherfucker gonna take that shit up...

533
00:44:06,243 --> 00:44:09,178
- I'm gonna challenge him every time.
- What? Challenge?

534
00:44:09,246 --> 00:44:12,704
Yo, don't be jumpin' on my boy like
