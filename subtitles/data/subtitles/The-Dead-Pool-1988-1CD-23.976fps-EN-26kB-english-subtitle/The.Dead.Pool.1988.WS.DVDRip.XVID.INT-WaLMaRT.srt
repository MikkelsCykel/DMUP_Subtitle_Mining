1
00:01:42,652 --> 00:01:46,486
A fire that claimed three lives
in a South Bay warehouse yesterday...

2
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:49,590
...is believed to have been
deliberately set.

3
00:01:49,793 --> 00:01:53,058
South Bay has been plagued
by a series of fires...

4
00:01:53,263 --> 00:01:54,730
...all of a similar nature.

5
00:01:54,931 --> 00:01:57,365
Authorities believe
arson is involved.

6
00:01:57,567 --> 00:01:59,467
They have no suspects at this time.

7
00:02:01,404 --> 00:02:05,602
Jazz composer Edward Barla was
eulogized today in a private ceremony.

8
00:02:05,809 --> 00:02:09,768
Barla was best known for the tunes
"Midnight Hearts " and "Just For You. "

9
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:12,106
Edward Barla, dead at the age of 56.

10
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:19,685
The murder trial of Lou Janero ended
today. Samantha Walker has the story.

11
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:21,584
After four days of deliberation...

12
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:25,659
... the jury found Lou Janero guilty
of the murder of Paul Cirela.

13
00:02:25,862 --> 00:02:30,526
Cirela, part of Janero's organization,
was set to testify against Janero...

14
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:34,669
...in an upcoming trial on charges
of bookmaking and tax evasion.

15
00:02:34,871 --> 00:02:39,205
Assistant D.A., Thomas McSherry,
credited Inspector Harry Callahan...

16
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:43,812
... for his part in the successful
prosecution of Lou Janero.

17
00:02:44,013 --> 00:02:47,881
A great deal of the credit
should go to Inspector Callahan.

18
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:50,211
He put Lou Janero out of business.

19
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:56,047
The inspector's evidence not only
implicated Janero in the murder...

20
00:02:56,259 --> 00:03:01,128
...but also provided the means to file
additional charges against Janero...

21
00:03:01,331 --> 00:03:03,299
... for bookmaking
and illegal gambling.

22
00:03:05,635 --> 00:03:08,763
I'm Samantha Walker for Channel 8.
Back to you, Pat.

23
00:04:54,744 --> 00:04:56,712
Get off my ass.

24
00:06:36,045 --> 00:06:37,273
He's going.

25
00:06:40,049 --> 00:06:42,483
Did you recognize
any of the attackers?

26
00:06:42,685 --> 00:06:46,382
Is this attack connected to your
testimony at the Janero trial?

27
00:06:46,589 --> 00:06:49,683
Has Janero put out a contract
on your life?

28
00:06:49,892 --> 00:06:51,519
Were these Janero's men?

29
00:06:51,727 --> 00:06:53,524
Have you received death threats?

30
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,890
Has the department offered
any extra protection?

31
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:00,092
The department will issue
a complete statement...

32
00:07:00,303 --> 00:07:03,602
...as soon as we've conducted
our own investigation.

33
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:07,576
$ 13,453.63

34
00:07:07,777 --> 00:07:10,541
That's how much
an unmarked squad car costs.

35
00:07:10,746 --> 00:07:13,237
That's the third car
you've trashed this month.

36
00:07:13,449 --> 00:07:15,349
- Lou Janero.
- What?

37
00:07:15,551 --> 00:07:17,985
His men shot up the car.
Send him the bill.

38
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:19,085
Very funny.

39
00:07:19,288 --> 00:07:23,156
See how funny it is behind a desk,
because you're off the street.

40
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:24,656
All this for a car?

41
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:27,022
At Lieutenant Ackerman's request.

42
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:29,460
The chief approved.
It's for your own good.

43
00:07:29,665 --> 00:07:33,465
- If you think I'm gonna--
- Just until we handle Janero.

44
00:07:33,669 --> 00:07:37,730
He may be in prison, but it's clear
he's calling the shots. Literally.

45
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:42,639
Can't have our newest hero turned to
Swiss cheese before the commendation.

46
00:07:42,845 --> 00:07:45,746
See? You' re getting a commendation.

47
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:48,440
Swell.

48
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,689
It's time we took advantage
of the press you' re getting.

49
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,755
How do you propose to do that?

50
00:07:55,958 --> 00:08:00,657
It's my opinion that you should
work with me in public relations.

51
00:08:00,863 --> 00:08:04,060
Opinions are like assholes.
Everybody has one.

52
00:08:06,335 --> 00:08:09,771
You don't realize what you've done
for the department's image.

53
00:08:09,972 --> 00:08:12,497
You just put a major
crime figure in prison.

54
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:15,575
You've got an extremely high
visibility right now.

55
00:08:15,778 --> 00:08:17,245
And for once, it's positive.

56
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,142
You know what that means
in terms of recruitment?

57
00:08:20,349 --> 00:08:23,147
Look at this.
Look at this copy we're getting.

58
00:08:23,352 --> 00:08:26,583
We've never been
this swamped for interviews.

59
00:08:26,789 --> 00:08:29,349
I'm not some dog- and- pony act.

60
00:08:30,493 --> 00:08:34,327
It's important we maximize your public
relations value while we can.

61
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:38,364
Getting close and personal
with reporters isn't my job.

62
00:08:38,568 --> 00:08:41,128
Your job is to promote the department.

63
00:08:41,337 --> 00:08:43,931
How positive would it be
if I resigned...

64
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,505
...lieutenant?

65
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:51,075
Don't misunderstand me.

66
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,841
Harry, all I'm asking for
is a little cooperation.

67
00:08:56,219 --> 00:08:59,916
All right, we don't have to pull you
off the street completely.

68
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:02,522
If you'd just be more cooperative
with the press.

69
00:09:02,725 --> 00:09:03,714
Anything else?

70
00:09:03,926 --> 00:09:05,359
Yeah.

71
00:09:06,596 --> 00:09:08,257
Quan, will you come in here?

72
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:14,062
Quan's moving over from the youth gang
task force to Homicide.

73
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:17,671
Good, Homicide can always use a cop
with Al's experience.

74
00:09:17,873 --> 00:09:19,067
I'm glad you agree.

75
00:09:19,275 --> 00:09:23,143
If you want to stay on the street,
you take Quan to watch your back.

76
00:09:23,346 --> 00:09:25,075
- Now hold on.
- That's final.

77
00:09:25,281 --> 00:09:29,843
That's swell, being that most
of my partners end up hurt or dead.

78
00:09:30,052 --> 00:09:32,145
Ask Al how he feels about that.

79
00:09:32,355 --> 00:09:35,950
Well, Quan? Any objections
to working with Callahan?

80
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:38,251
I think I can handle it.

81
00:09:39,061 --> 00:09:40,619
Get a bulletproof vest, kid.

82
00:09:41,564 --> 00:09:46,365
Teaming Harry with a Chinese- American
will be good for the department image.

83
00:09:52,608 --> 00:09:53,802
You have any kids?

84
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,705
Me? No.

85
00:09:56,045 --> 00:09:57,569
Lucky for them.

86
00:11:24,967 --> 00:11:26,264
Cut. Cut!

87
00:11:27,503 --> 00:11:30,961
You're out of sync, Johnny.
What's the problem here?

88
00:11:33,309 --> 00:11:34,742
Where is that fool?

89
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,138
Jeff!

90
00:11:36,479 --> 00:11:37,446
Jeff!

91
00:11:37,646 --> 00:11:39,238
We've had a short, Peter.

92
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:41,882
You had all the bugs out.
"T rust me, " you said.

93
00:11:42,084 --> 00:11:44,052
- Right? Did he say that?
- "T rust me. "

94
00:11:44,253 --> 00:11:46,881
That means "fuck you"
in this business.

95
00:11:47,089 --> 00:11:47,919
I checked it.

96
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:51,389
I've got a backup head.
Give me 20 minutes and we'll be ready.

97
00:11:51,694 --> 00:11:54,492
All right, do it.
And no cock- ups this time.

98
00:11:54,697 --> 00:11:57,427
And that goes for the rest
of you morons.

99
00:11:59,702 --> 00:12:01,499
This sucks, man.

100
00:12:02,271 --> 00:12:05,104
How can I sing
with shit exploding all over?

101
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:06,740
It was just an accident.

102
00:12:06,942 --> 00:12:09,206
This whole movie is an accident.

103
00:12:09,412 --> 00:12:12,040
How did I get talked into this shit?

104
00:12:12,248 --> 00:12:15,547
You needed a video.
I needed this sequence for the film.

105
00:12:15,751 --> 00:12:18,185
Stop complaining,
we're getting what we want.

106
00:12:18,387 --> 00:12:23,256
Why couldn't we shoot on a warm
sound stage, instead of a meat locker?

107
00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:27,691
I need it cold so the audience
can see your breath when you sing.

108
00:12:27,897 --> 00:12:28,955
Brilliant.

109
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:33,329
We won't be original, but people
will know I froze my ass off.

110
00:12:33,536 --> 00:12:34,969
What's that supposed to mean?

111
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:40,006
A director with talent would have
the guts to shoot something original.

112
00:12:40,209 --> 00:12:43,144
Instead of ripping off old movies
like The Exorcist.

113
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:47,782
This is not a rip- off,
it's a homage. You stupid....

114
00:12:52,388 --> 00:12:54,219
Jesus, I don't believe you.

115
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:55,888
What?

116
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:57,319
You' re hurting.

117
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:00,127
I don't know what you mean.

118
00:13:00,329 --> 00:13:03,196
Don't give me that.
You promised, not during shooting.

119
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:06,163
I know what I'm doing.

120
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:07,357
I can handle it.

121
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:09,003
You won't fuck up my film!

122
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:10,638
I said, I can handle it!

123
00:13:13,909 --> 00:13:18,505
Just let me go back to the trailer
and get it together.

124
00:13:19,515 --> 00:13:21,415
Then we'll kick some ass.

125
00:13:21,617 --> 00:13:23,175
- OK?
- OK.

126
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:24,519
Can I get a Coke?

127
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,950
Get a Coke, please, for Johnny.

128
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:29,655
Now what?

129
00:13:29,859 --> 00:13:32,350
Don't worry,
Johnny's like a trained seal.

130
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,756
Throw him a fish, he'll perform.

131
00:13:58,387 --> 00:14:00,480
Rise and shine, boys.

132
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:03,621
Time to get up.

133
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,429
What's happening?

134
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,920
I always knew working Homicide
would be glamorous.

135
00:15:41,123 --> 00:15:43,751
I mean, meeting celebrities and all.

136
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:47,218
Too bad you can't get his autograph.

137
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:51,090
You know, Harry,
they always die in threes.

138
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:55,363
When one celebrity dies, two more
always go in a week or two.

139
00:15:56,739 --> 00:15:58,138
It's a fact, Harry.

140
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,205
Celebrities always die in threes.

141
00:16:00,409 --> 00:16:04,140
Well, this one's got crystalline
powder around his nose and mouth.

142
00:16:04,346 --> 00:16:06,371
Scabs up and down both arms.

143
00:16:06,582 --> 00:16:09,915
Fresh puncture marks
on his left forearm.

144
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:15,384
Yeah, Homicide can be
really glamorous.

145
00:16:38,681 --> 00:16:40,979
All right,
check the dummy out, please.

146
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,016
Meagan.

147
00:16:46,488 --> 00:16:49,116
I want a three- inch lens, very tight.

148
00:16:50,192 --> 00:16:51,591
T ry not to drop it.

149
00:16:51,794 --> 00:16:55,594
Let's hurry up and shoot this
and wrap this up, please.

150
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:09,172
And my second assistant and I
found Johnny in his trailer.

151
00:17:09,645 --> 00:17:11,374
He was just lying there.

152
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:13,912
At first we thought it was a joke.

153
00:17:14,216 --> 00:17:17,117
- But then, well....
- When did you last see him alive?

154
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:19,082
About a half- hour before that.

155
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:22,189
He went back to his trailer
while we set up.

156
00:17:22,391 --> 00:17:23,483
Was he alone?

157
00:17:23,692 --> 00:17:26,661
I don't know.
But he was alone when we found him.

158
00:17:27,396 --> 00:17:30,092
T ell me, does anyone
on your set use drugs?

159
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:33,564
We don't do drugs, Callahan.
We do film.

160
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:37,731
Look, what people do
is their own business.

161
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:42,036
If it doesn't interfere with my film,
I really don't give a shit.

162
00:17:46,949 --> 00:17:48,746
What about Squares? Was he using?

163
00:17:48,951 --> 00:17:51,078
How should I know?

164
00:17:51,286 --> 00:17:53,186
Johnny had agents, lawyers, friends.

165
00:17:53,388 --> 00:17:57,017
It was their job to deal with his
drug problem, not mine.

166
00:17:57,226 --> 00:17:59,558
Well, that's a very caring attitude.

167
00:17:59,962 --> 00:18:03,591
What do you want, Callahan?
Drugs were Johnny's trademark.

168
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:06,165
He made his career singing about them.

169
00:18:06,368 --> 00:18:07,960
It made him controversial.

170
00:18:08,437 --> 00:18:11,201
I can see why you'd want him
in your flick.

171
00:18:11,406 --> 00:18:13,101
It was a marketing decision.

172
00:18:13,308 --> 00:18:17,074
Johnny Squares sells tickets.
You know, bums on seats, love.

173
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:19,543
Besides, we needed
a music video tie- in.

174
00:18:19,748 --> 00:18:21,477
Any idea who was supplying him?

175
00:18:23,285 --> 00:18:27,278
No, but if I hear of anything,
you'll be the first one I call.

176
00:18:27,489 --> 00:18:29,423
Marvelous.

177
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:38,197
Check on anyone
who dealt with Squares.

178
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,836
- Whether it was the cast or crew--
- Inspector Callahan.

179
00:18:42,304 --> 00:18:43,931
Inspector.

180
00:18:44,139 --> 00:18:45,572
Shit.

181
00:18:45,941 --> 00:18:48,466
Is it true that Johnny Squares OD'd?

182
00:18:48,677 --> 00:18:51,202
We're conducting an investigation.

183
00:18:51,413 --> 00:18:54,507
Right as we speak.
At this point, nothing's been--

184
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:56,877
Thank you, inspector.

185
00:19:00,522 --> 00:19:02,649
Excuse me, are you Suzanne Dayton?

186
00:19:02,858 --> 00:19:04,189
What's going on here?

187
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:05,724
Johnny?

188
00:19:06,094 --> 00:19:07,459
Johnny?

189
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:10,091
Hold it. I'm sorry,
you have to step back.

190
00:19:10,299 --> 00:19:12,563
- No, Johnny!
- There's nothing they can do.

191
00:19:16,672 --> 00:19:18,606
You' re gonna make yourself sick.

192
00:19:18,807 --> 00:19:21,742
Hold on, could we
give her a little air?

193
00:19:22,711 --> 00:19:24,110
Out of the way, please.

194
00:19:30,385 --> 00:19:31,852
Off with that camera.

195
00:19:32,054 --> 00:19:34,454
I can film whatever I want.
IKeep shooting.

196
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:36,555
This is someone else's heartache.

197
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:38,225
Right in here.

198
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,952
What are you doing? Give me that.

199
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,096
Smart.

200
00:20:56,805 --> 00:21:00,673
High and Dry is the kind of
mindless film comedy...

201
00:21:00,876 --> 00:21:05,210
... that's come to typify summer films
aimed at the youth market.

202
00:21:05,414 --> 00:21:08,815
The humor is of the
locker- room variety.

203
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:13,181
Audiences seeking more sophistication
will have to look elsewhere.

204
00:21:13,388 --> 00:21:14,480
The producers--

205
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:18,317
Rock star Johnny Squares
was found dead this afternoon.

206
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:21,087
Samantha Walker filed this report.

207
00:21:22,264 --> 00:21:26,667
The body of Johnny Squares was found
today at the Royal Meat Company...

208
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:29,837
... where he was on location
filming Hotel Satan.

209
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:35,101
The cause of death is not known,
but Squares had a history of drug use.

210
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:38,905
The rock star was arrested last July
for possession of heroin.

211
00:21:39,114 --> 00:21:42,880
Many of his songs were allegedly
based on his drug experience.

212
00:22:05,974 --> 00:22:07,464
What's that all about?

213
00:22:07,676 --> 00:22:09,701
My past catching up with me.

214
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:14,075
As a kid, I was in the gang
that hit him up for protection money.

215
00:22:14,483 --> 00:22:18,317
All my life, I've been running in
gangs or trying to put them away.

216
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:22,923
So I figured I'd come over to Homicide
for something different.

217
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:25,093
It's different, all right.

218
00:22:29,164 --> 00:22:30,426
Call for backup.

219
00:22:37,906 --> 00:22:40,534
Come on, get the fuck out of here.
Hurry up!

220
00:22:53,655 --> 00:22:54,747
Move it! Move it!

221
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:57,390
Put your money on the table!
Hurry up!

222
00:22:57,592 --> 00:22:58,752
Don't move!

223
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,860
Don't fuck with me, lady!

224
00:23:01,229 --> 00:23:02,856
Come on, guys, hurry up!

225
00:23:03,065 --> 00:23:05,226
- You forgot your fortune cookie.
- What!?

226
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:14,606
It says:

227
00:23:16,211 --> 00:23:17,644
"You' re shit out of luck. "

228
00:23:40,435 --> 00:23:41,424
Get out of the way!

229
00:24:11,299 --> 00:24:15,736
"T eaming up with a Chinese- American is
good for the department's image. "

230
00:24:33,522 --> 00:24:34,546
Who was he?

231
00:24:34,756 --> 00:24:37,554
Some guy in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

232
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:40,057
Madison. Dean Madison was his name.

233
00:24:40,262 --> 00:24:41,627
Does it ring a bell?

234
00:24:42,464 --> 00:24:45,627
- Never heard of him.
- Well, he knew you, Harry.

235
00:24:45,834 --> 00:24:49,065
I found this in his pocket.
It's a list of celebrities.

236
00:24:49,671 --> 00:24:53,664
Tony Engelhart, the pro linebacker.
Michael Cipriano, the race car driver.

237
00:24:53,875 --> 00:24:57,311
Oh, and one Inspector Harry Callahan.

238
00:24:58,813 --> 00:25:02,806
Johnny Squares is on that list.
See what's written by his name?

239
00:25:03,818 --> 00:25:07,413
Yeah, RIP. " Rest in peace. "

240
00:25:10,025 --> 00:25:11,390
You know what this is?

241
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:13,891
It's a bill for a TV camera and lens.

242
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:18,156
When I said stop wrecking cars,
I didn't mean destroy something else.

243
00:25:18,366 --> 00:25:20,926
They interfered
with an investigation, sir.

244
00:25:21,136 --> 00:25:24,867
Don't give us that. Is this
your idea of media cooperation?

245
00:25:25,073 --> 00:25:27,268
Cooperation works two ways.

246
00:25:27,475 --> 00:25:29,966
What is it you have against reporters?

247
00:25:30,178 --> 00:25:32,612
Some of them
are just marvelous people.

248
00:25:32,814 --> 00:25:36,807
Others walk through a pile and track
it through an investigation.

249
00:25:37,018 --> 00:25:39,179
You better change
your attitude fast.

250
00:25:39,387 --> 00:25:42,322
Because unless we
reach an agreement with them...

251
00:25:42,524 --> 00:25:46,119
...it's liable to cost this city
2 million, and your career.

252
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:49,627
Join us, please.

253
00:25:49,831 --> 00:25:52,493
This is Ms. Samantha Walker
of station lKWSF.

254
00:25:52,701 --> 00:25:53,599
Captain Donnelly.

255
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:57,033
- Ms. Walker.
- Captain.

256
00:25:57,239 --> 00:26:00,072
- And this is Inspector--
- Callahan. We've met.

257
00:26:00,275 --> 00:26:03,574
Yes, of course. Won't you sit down?

258
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:06,636
Ms. Walker...

259
00:26:06,848 --> 00:26:10,944
... Lieutenant Ackerman tells me
you have a proposal to make...

260
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:13,620
... regarding the accidental
damage to--

261
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:16,484
There was nothing accidental about it.

262
00:26:18,426 --> 00:26:21,293
The department might have something
to say about that.

263
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:23,964
Although the camera was destroyed...

264
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:27,032
...I have the entire
incident on video.

265
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:29,969
I see.

266
00:26:33,208 --> 00:26:34,368
And your proposal?

267
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:39,239
We may be willing to drop
the lawsuit against the city...

268
00:26:39,447 --> 00:26:41,938
...but that depends
on Inspector Callahan.

269
00:26:43,918 --> 00:26:46,580
I'm sure the inspector
would be willing to--

270
00:26:46,788 --> 00:26:48,278
What do you have in mind?

271
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:51,848
Dinner.

272
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:10,976
I owe you an apology.

273
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,713
You were right
about what I did the other day.

274
00:27:13,915 --> 00:27:17,407
I had no business intruding
on that girl's grief.

275
00:27:19,321 --> 00:27:20,879
I get too eager sometimes.

276
00:27:21,089 --> 00:27:24,183
In my rush to get the story,
I made an error in judgement.

277
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:26,223
We all make those sometimes.

278
00:27:26,428 --> 00:27:28,896
No, I should have known better.

279
00:27:29,097 --> 00:27:30,655
I'm sorry.

280
00:27:31,766 --> 00:27:34,326
- Let me ask you, Miss Walker--
- Sam.

281
00:27:34,602 --> 00:27:35,694
Sam.

282
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:36,928
Do you like cops?

283
00:27:38,006 --> 00:27:40,440
If they' re not in my
rear- view mirror. Why?

284
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:44,474
I wonder what
we' re supposed to talk about...

285
00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:47,045
...other than the damaged camera.

286
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:49,045
Oh, no, no, no.

287
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:52,515
I'm letting the insurance company
deal with that.

288
00:27:53,655 --> 00:27:57,455
And I think I can be persuaded
to drop the lawsuit...

289
00:27:57,659 --> 00:27:59,559
...but I want something in return.

290
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:03,122
What would that be?

291
00:28:03,465 --> 00:28:04,693
I want your story.

292
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,100
What's that?

293
00:28:10,305 --> 00:28:12,739
I've done my homework on you.

294
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:15,375
You've had quite a colorful career.

295
00:28:15,577 --> 00:28:17,272
Loot at this. You see...

296
00:28:17,479 --> 00:28:21,677
...there's a lot of interest right now
in the Janero case...

297
00:28:21,883 --> 00:28:23,748
...and the cop who put him in prison.

298
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:28,321
Channel 8 is doing a news special
on organized crime in the Bay Area.

299
00:28:28,523 --> 00:28:32,653
But what I would like to do
is an in- depth profile...

300
00:28:32,861 --> 00:28:35,762
...of you, Inspector Harry Callahan.

301
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:37,556
Sorry, I'm not interested.

302
00:28:37,766 --> 00:28:41,896
Why not? This latest attempt
on your life by one of Janero's men--

303
00:28:42,103 --> 00:28:45,004
You' re not interested
in doing a story on me.

304
00:28:45,206 --> 00:28:47,174
You want blood. That's what sells--

305
00:28:47,375 --> 00:28:50,242
- Now wait a minute--
- No, you wait a minute.

306
00:28:50,445 --> 00:28:53,005
You people are interested
in death and mayhem...

307
00:28:53,214 --> 00:28:55,444
...and you don't care
how you get the story.

308
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:59,984
That is not fair. That's not
the kind of journalism I do.

309
00:29:00,188 --> 00:29:02,816
To you I'm just a cop
with a price on his head.

310
00:29:03,024 --> 00:29:07,017
Let me tell you, I don't like
people saying they're gonna kill me.

311
00:29:07,228 --> 00:29:10,755
Nor do I like journalists using it
as a way to increase ratings.

312
00:29:10,965 --> 00:29:14,867
- What I was going to say--
- That's the end of the story.

313
00:29:31,085 --> 00:29:32,177
Sorry.

314
00:29:34,923 --> 00:29:37,221
The coroner's report last night...

315
00:29:37,725 --> 00:29:39,818
...said that Squares used speedballs.

316
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,689
Injecting cocaine and heroin?

317
00:29:41,896 --> 00:29:43,420
But that's not what killed him.

318
00:29:43,631 --> 00:29:46,794
He was using an inhaler
with some new designer drug.

319
00:29:47,001 --> 00:29:49,094
A synthetic form of heroin.

320
00:29:49,304 --> 00:29:52,068
You mean something along the lines
of China White.

321
00:29:52,273 --> 00:29:55,071
Only a thousand times wore powerful.

322
00:29:55,276 --> 00:29:58,507
One snort and he went into
immediate respiratory failure.

323
00:29:58,713 --> 00:30:00,408
IKnow what I'm trying to figure?

324
00:30:00,615 --> 00:30:02,276
Why is a guy like that...

325
00:30:02,484 --> 00:30:06,284
...screwing with synthetic junk
when he's got the real stuff?

326
00:30:06,488 --> 00:30:08,649
Maybe he didn't know
what he was using.

327
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:15,222
Harry.

328
00:30:20,201 --> 00:30:21,031
Harry?

329
00:30:23,638 --> 00:30:25,299
Sorry about that.

330
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:30,237
Get you next time.

331
00:30:36,784 --> 00:30:39,912
Check the cast and crew
for prior drug busts.

332
00:30:40,121 --> 00:30:44,888
I'll check with Narcotics to see if any
dealers are moving synthetic heroin.

333
00:30:45,193 --> 00:30:47,457
Harry, there's something here
you should see.

334
00:30:48,162 --> 00:30:51,131
A story to be published
in today's T ribune...

335
00:30:51,332 --> 00:30:55,462
...reveals that director Peter Swan
and several other people involved...

336
00:30:55,670 --> 00:31:00,539
...in the film Hotel Satan were
playing a game called "The Dead Pool. "

337
00:31:00,742 --> 00:31:03,267
According to sources,
the object of the game...

338
00:31:03,478 --> 00:31:06,379
... was for players to pick
eight Bay Area celebrities...

339
00:31:06,581 --> 00:31:10,244
... who might die
by a predetermined date.

340
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:15,252
The winner was to possess the list
with the most dead celebrities.

341
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:17,583
What makes this story significant...

342
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:22,786
...is that rock star Johnny Squares
was on director Peter Swan's list.

343
00:31:22,997 --> 00:31:25,795
Although Swan would not comment...

344
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,333
... we have confirmed that
there was such a game...

345
00:31:29,537 --> 00:31:34,099
...and Swan's production accountant,
Dean Madison, was also involved.

346
00:31:34,342 --> 00:31:36,902
Ironically, Madison was
killed yesterday...

347
00:31:37,111 --> 00:31:40,603
...in a tragic holdup attempt
that took place in Chinatown.

348
00:31:43,685 --> 00:31:47,985
"There is no man who is master of the
breath of life so as to retain it...

349
00:31:48,189 --> 00:31:51,181
...and none has mastery
over the day of death.

350
00:31:51,392 --> 00:31:54,225
For the Lord of all
shows no partiality...

351
00:31:54,429 --> 00:31:55,987
... nor does He fear greatness...

352
00:31:56,197 --> 00:31:58,062
... because He himself
made the great...

353
00:31:58,266 --> 00:31:59,790
...as well as the small.

354
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:02,799
And He provides for all alike.

355
00:32:03,571 --> 00:32:07,132
And the dust returns to the
earth, as it once was.

356
00:32:07,575 --> 00:32:11,170
And the life breath
returns to God, who gaveth. "

357
00:32:18,553 --> 00:32:20,282
My condolences.

358
00:32:20,955 --> 00:32:23,515
Mrs. Dayton, I'm terribly sorry.

359
00:32:23,758 --> 00:32:26,750
Suzanne, I'm very sorry
for your trouble.

360
00:32:26,961 --> 00:32:28,258
Thank you.

361
00:32:30,064 --> 00:32:31,554
My sympathies, dear.

362
00:32:34,102 --> 00:32:37,731
Do you mind, gentlemen?
I happen to be at a funeral.

363
00:32:37,972 --> 00:32:39,906
I'd like to talk about your list.

364
00:32:40,108 --> 00:32:43,566
It's no big secret.
The cast and crew knew about it.

365
00:32:43,778 --> 00:32:46,975
The Dead Pool is just a harmless game.

366
00:32:47,181 --> 00:32:49,547
It sounds pretty sick to me.

367
00:32:50,118 --> 00:32:51,608
Let me tell you something.

368
00:32:51,986 --> 00:32:54,921
People are fascinated
with death and violence.

369
00:32:55,123 --> 00:32:57,023
That's why my films make money.

370
00:32:57,225 --> 00:33:00,524
They're an escape,
a vicarious release of fear.

371
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:02,559
Same thing with this game.

372
00:33:02,764 --> 00:33:05,460
Nobody takes my films
or the Dead Pool seriously.

373
00:33:06,167 --> 00:33:09,694
Someone gave Squares the drugs
that killed him. Maybe you.

374
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:13,362
You can't tie me to Johnny's death
because of a coincidence.

375
00:33:14,809 --> 00:33:19,075
My assistant and effects supervisor
played too. Why not talk to them?

376
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,247
We will.

377
00:33:21,215 --> 00:33:23,308
But nobody on their list is dead yet.

378
00:33:23,518 --> 00:33:28,012
Johnny was a drug user and I predicted
he'd die this year. That's all.

379
00:33:28,222 --> 00:33:31,316
The idea is to pick celebrities
who won't make it...

380
00:33:31,526 --> 00:33:34,552
... because they' re old, sick
or in a high- risk profession.

381
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:36,252
Like police work?

382
00:33:36,731 --> 00:33:37,698
Nothing personal.

383
00:33:37,899 --> 00:33:40,459
I don't like being on your list, Swan.

384
00:33:40,668 --> 00:33:43,398
That's what this is really about,
isn't it?

385
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:44,764
If you have a choice--

386
00:33:44,972 --> 00:33:47,668
Maybe I'll start my own Pool
and put you on it.

387
00:33:47,875 --> 00:33:49,308
Are you threatening me?

388
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:54,347
If you want to play the game,
you'd better know the rules, love.

389
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:15,261
That's our report. I'm Patrick Snow.

390
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:18,337
I'm Samantha Walker.
Thank you for being with us.

391
00:34:18,539 --> 00:34:20,507
Tune in tonight
for an exclusive report...

392
00:34:20,708 --> 00:34:23,108
...on chemical dependency
among celebrities.

393
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:24,938
Who they are, why they do it...

394
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:27,774
...and the price they pay.
Tonight at 11.

395
00:34:27,982 --> 00:34:29,279
Good night.

396
00:34:30,218 --> 00:34:31,845
And we' re clear.

397
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:52,935
Thought I'd seen the last of you.

398
00:34:53,141 --> 00:34:54,665
I saw your report yesterday.

399
00:34:54,876 --> 00:34:57,003
We confirmed it
with people in the game.

400
00:34:57,211 --> 00:35:01,978
Vicky Owens, Swan's assistant,
and effects supervisor, Jeff Howser.

401
00:35:02,316 --> 00:35:05,149
It didn't occur to you
to clear it with us first?

402
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:06,911
I had to go with the story.

403
00:35:07,121 --> 00:35:10,648
The papers got the same tip.
I had to get the story out fast.

404
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:13,053
Or someone else would get it first?

405
00:35:13,261 --> 00:35:15,491
- Something like that.
- How were you tipped?

406
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:19,655
By mail. A copy of the Dead Pool
and a letter explaining it.

407
00:35:22,236 --> 00:35:24,568
- It's already started.
- What has?

408
00:35:24,772 --> 00:35:26,797
All the media bullshit.

409
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:31,068
Newspapers print the Dead Pool
and it hurts our investigation.

410
00:35:31,279 --> 00:35:32,837
What bothers you...

411
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:35,777
...is that we found out about
the Dead Pool first.

412
00:35:35,983 --> 00:35:40,352
You people take Janero and the Dead
Pool, add hype and distortion...

413
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:42,182
...and innocent people get hurt.

414
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:44,358
Aren't you overreacting?

415
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:45,992
I've seen it happen.

416
00:35:46,194 --> 00:35:49,027
I don't like the hype, either...

417
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:51,562
... but it happens when reporters
compete for a story.

418
00:35:51,933 --> 00:35:55,926
Why don't you start thinking about
your responsibility to the public?

419
00:35:57,438 --> 00:36:00,373
You can't kill the messenger
because of the message.

420
00:36:01,943 --> 00:36:06,277
I'm sorry, it wasn't my intention
to screw up your investigation.

421
00:36:07,181 --> 00:36:09,445
Here's the list. Now, excuse me.

422
00:36:11,986 --> 00:36:13,180
Thanks.

423
00:36:16,958 --> 00:36:18,482
It seems I owe you one.

424
00:36:21,495 --> 00:36:22,985
Dinner, that is.

425
00:36:26,167 --> 00:36:30,934
I was offered a job as an anchor
at this small, local station.

426
00:36:31,138 --> 00:36:32,571
Because...

427
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:36,037
... I was first runner- up
in Miss Colorado.

428
00:36:36,244 --> 00:36:38,838
Colorado? We' re right over here.

429
00:36:39,046 --> 00:36:43,449
But I had absolutely no experience,
just my bachelor's in journalism.

430
00:36:43,651 --> 00:36:47,519
But it was a way in, so I grabbed it.

431
00:36:50,658 --> 00:36:53,627
But I didn't just smile at
the camera and read copy.

432
00:36:53,828 --> 00:36:56,456
I did anything and everything
at this station.

433
00:36:56,664 --> 00:37:00,725
Sports, news, hard news, weather.

434
00:37:00,935 --> 00:37:02,869
I produced documentaries.

435
00:37:04,705 --> 00:37:06,639
I love San Francisco.

436
00:37:06,841 --> 00:37:08,468
But it isn't easy.

437
00:37:09,844 --> 00:37:12,005
Big city, big news.

438
00:37:12,914 --> 00:37:15,280
I had to prove myself all over again.

439
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:17,144
Have you succeeded?

440
00:37:17,518 --> 00:37:18,746
Somewhat.

441
00:37:20,087 --> 00:37:21,520
Apparently not with you.

442
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:27,159
I shouldn't complain. At least you
stayed for dinner this time.

443
00:37:28,963 --> 00:37:31,124
I'd still love to do your story.

444
00:37:31,699 --> 00:37:32,961
No, thanks.

445
00:37:33,234 --> 00:37:36,533
You're wrong about me, Callahan,
and what I want to do.

446
00:37:37,305 --> 00:37:39,239
I wish I could convince you.

447
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:41,073
I'll tell you what.

448
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:43,303
Let's think on it.

449
00:37:44,412 --> 00:37:45,310
Sounds fair.

450
00:37:48,049 --> 00:37:49,277
Thank you.

451
00:38:03,898 --> 00:38:07,163
It's the truth,
I don't care what you say.

452
00:38:14,141 --> 00:38:15,768
Hey, Callahan.

453
00:38:16,143 --> 00:38:18,703
- You' re Callahan, aren't you?
- That's right.

454
00:38:18,913 --> 00:38:20,005
What can I do for you?

455
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:22,614
You' re the cop who put Janero away.

456
00:38:25,653 --> 00:38:28,213
All I want is your autograph.

457
00:38:29,991 --> 00:38:31,822
Can I shake your hand?

458
00:38:35,429 --> 00:38:36,896
I'd just like to thank you.

459
00:38:37,098 --> 00:38:40,397
It's about time somebody
did something about Janero.

460
00:38:40,601 --> 00:38:44,367
Could you sign it to
Chester Docksteder? That's me.

461
00:38:45,473 --> 00:38:46,872
Let me buy you a drink.

462
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:48,541
Some other time.

463
00:38:49,143 --> 00:38:52,806
We need more cops like you.
That's what we need.

464
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:55,575
I gotta change my shorts.

465
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,049
What are you laughing at?

466
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:03,985
This is your 15 minutes, Callahan.

467
00:39:04,525 --> 00:39:08,985
Andy Warhol said everybody's famous
for 15 minutes. Well, this is it.

468
00:39:09,196 --> 00:39:10,220
Swell.

469
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,604
Was it your first autograph?

470
00:39:27,815 --> 00:39:28,975
Yeah.

471
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:31,411
And I hope my last.

472
00:40:58,205 --> 00:40:59,934
You know something?

473
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:03,142
I don't think Lou Janero
likes you very much.

474
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:17,785
She's okay. Just a little shaken up.

475
00:41:23,964 --> 00:41:25,625
How're you doing, girl?

476
00:41:29,336 --> 00:41:33,102
Whatever they're paying you, Harry,
it couldn't be enough.

477
00:41:37,678 --> 00:41:39,202
My colleagues.

478
00:41:44,318 --> 00:41:46,218
I don't want to be the news.

479
00:41:47,888 --> 00:41:49,480
Let's get you out of here.

480
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:24,591
You sure you want to see this guy?

481
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:26,054
Yeah.

482
00:42:36,837 --> 00:42:38,134
Here's your animal.

483
00:42:38,672 --> 00:42:39,502
Hicks.

484
00:42:39,707 --> 00:42:41,334
What the fuck do you want?

485
00:42:41,542 --> 00:42:43,601
I brought you some cigarettes.

486
00:42:44,211 --> 00:42:46,441
And what would I have to do for you?

487
00:42:46,714 --> 00:42:49,683
Nothing. Just stand where I tell you.

488
00:43:16,243 --> 00:43:17,574
Stay right here.

489
00:43:17,778 --> 00:43:19,245
Fifth cell down.

490
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:32,348
That's the trouble with this prison.
They let anybody in.

491
00:43:32,793 --> 00:43:35,853
I don't like scum like you
trying to kill me.

492
00:43:37,131 --> 00:43:41,966
Sounds to me like this Dead Pool thing
is making you a little paranoid.

493
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:46,233
Oh, yeah. I heard about it.

494
00:43:46,473 --> 00:43:49,135
Good news travels fast.

495
00:43:49,343 --> 00:43:51,709
Big fucking media hero.

496
00:43:51,912 --> 00:43:54,437
Hero today and gone tomorrow.

497
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:56,683
Call off your guns.

498
00:43:56,917 --> 00:43:58,578
What are you talking about?

499
00:43:58,786 --> 00:44:02,813
Your trouble is, you have
too much time on your hands.

500
00:44:03,023 --> 00:44:04,513
What you need is a job.

501
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:05,555
A what?

502
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:07,056
A job.

503
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:10,894
I'm gonna give you a job
being a postman, understand?

504
00:44:11,098 --> 00:44:13,760
It'll be your job to see
the mail gets through.

505
00:44:14,802 --> 00:44:16,929
See that gorilla down there?

506
00:44:25,612 --> 00:44:29,742
That's Butcher Hicks, and he's killed
three men. You know how?

507
00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:33,408
He tore them apart with his teeth.
Never found all the pieces.

508
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:35,884
He has an unhealthy appetite.

509
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:37,284
So what?

510
00:44:37,491 --> 00:44:40,085
So Hicks there is my new pen pal.

511
00:44:40,294 --> 00:44:42,353
I'll write him once a week...

512
00:44:42,563 --> 00:44:45,430
...about how I'm looking in
on his sick mother...

513
00:44:45,632 --> 00:44:48,624
...and trying to get him
special privileges here.

514
00:44:48,969 --> 00:44:53,599
And the interesting part is,
if anything happens to me...

515
00:44:53,807 --> 00:44:55,536
...and Hicks doesn't get his letter...

516
00:44:55,743 --> 00:44:58,803
... he'll be really pissed off.
And he'll come to see you...

517
00:44:59,012 --> 00:45:00,309
... because you' re the mailman.

518
00:45:01,915 --> 00:45:06,818
He'll probably come down here
and cancel your ass like a stamp.

519
00:45:09,523 --> 00:45:12,458
You better ensure prompt,
courteous delivery.

520
00:45:12,659 --> 00:45:15,685
And pray nothing happens to me.

521
00:45:20,434 --> 00:45:22,163
- That's it?
- That's it.

522
00:45:22,369 --> 00:45:25,497
See that dirtbag
I was talking to down there?

523
00:45:28,108 --> 00:45:30,133
He says smoking can cause cancer...

524
00:45:30,344 --> 00:45:34,713
...and anyone who smokes as much
as you do is one dumb son of a bitch.

525
00:45:54,435 --> 00:45:56,232
Fire!

526
00:45:58,038 --> 00:45:58,936
Cut!

527
00:45:59,139 --> 00:46:01,573
Cut! Cut.

528
00:46:03,243 --> 00:46:05,643
Where is that stupid fuck? Hauser!

529
00:46:06,814 --> 00:46:08,679
Get your ass down here.

530
00:46:11,051 --> 00:46:14,384
You're supposed to harpoon
the goddamn dummy.

531
00:46:15,656 --> 00:46:16,782
The tide shifted.

532
00:46:16,990 --> 00:46:20,585
"The tide shifted. "
The ocean's incompetent, not you.

533
00:46:20,794 --> 00:46:22,921
This is the third time this week.

534
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:25,121
You'll never work for me again.

535
00:46:25,332 --> 00:46:27,766
There's a bunch
of reporters down there.

536
00:46:30,737 --> 00:46:32,261
Come on, come on.

537
00:46:37,678 --> 00:46:39,373
Can we ask you a few questions?

538
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:40,911
Please!

539
00:46:41,114 --> 00:46:42,945
I'd like to say one thing.

540
00:46:43,150 --> 00:46:45,050
In light of what's happened...

541
00:46:45,252 --> 00:46:48,050
...perhaps playing the Dead Pool game
isn't smart.

542
00:46:48,255 --> 00:46:51,019
Any tie between the Dead Pool
and Squares' death?

543
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:53,625
None whatsoever. Next question.

544
00:46:53,827 --> 00:46:55,886
Mr. Swan, will the game continue?

545
00:46:56,096 --> 00:46:59,793
No, we' re filming a nightmare
sequence at the shipyards...

546
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,163
...and we'd like to forget this
and get on with our job.

547
00:47:03,470 --> 00:47:05,438
Johnny would have wanted it that way.

548
00:47:05,639 --> 00:47:10,508
First Squares died, then your
production accountant was killed.

549
00:47:10,711 --> 00:47:12,474
Is Hotel Satan cursed?

550
00:47:12,679 --> 00:47:15,842
People can believe what they want,
but nothing....

551
00:47:17,718 --> 00:47:20,619
Nothing will stop me
from making this film.

552
00:47:22,723 --> 00:47:24,156
End of interview.

553
00:48:08,468 --> 00:48:12,234
Whatever you want,
money, credit cards, just take it.

554
00:48:12,439 --> 00:48:15,465
Ever notice how time
slows down at night?

555
00:48:15,676 --> 00:48:19,339
Just like in my films. A dream world.

556
00:48:19,546 --> 00:48:20,672
Shut up!

557
00:48:21,415 --> 00:48:23,849
I can't hear the colors.
I've got to hear them.

558
00:48:24,418 --> 00:48:28,821
That's the mark of a good director,
you have to hear the colors.

559
00:48:29,022 --> 00:48:31,957
You've gotta be able
to taste the sounds.

560
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:33,524
I have a heart condition.

561
00:48:33,727 --> 00:48:35,558
A critic with a heart.

562
00:48:35,862 --> 00:48:37,124
That's a laugh.

563
00:48:39,199 --> 00:48:40,791
Do you like my films?

564
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:44,698
- I said, do you like my films?
- Who are you?

565
00:48:49,943 --> 00:48:53,310
- You know who I am.
- I don't. I don't know you.

566
00:48:53,513 --> 00:48:54,810
God...

567
00:48:55,215 --> 00:48:58,184
...what kind of a film critic are you?

568
00:48:59,052 --> 00:49:00,917
Shadows of the Dead!

569
00:49:02,623 --> 00:49:04,352
Hell Without the Devil!

570
00:49:04,591 --> 00:49:06,616
Night of the Slasher!

571
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:10,425
Peter Swan.

572
00:49:11,832 --> 00:49:13,322
Brilliant, love.

573
00:49:14,501 --> 00:49:16,492
What do you think of my films?

574
00:49:17,070 --> 00:49:20,506
Give me your honest opinion.

575
00:49:21,642 --> 00:49:23,542
I like them.

576
00:49:23,744 --> 00:49:24,870
Liar!

577
00:49:34,121 --> 00:49:36,885
The entrance is probably
through the sliding glass door.

578
00:49:37,090 --> 00:49:39,115
She wasn't sexually assaulted.

579
00:49:39,326 --> 00:49:40,884
IKilled sometime last night.

580
00:49:41,094 --> 00:49:44,120
Maid found her this morning.
Do you recognize her?

581
00:49:44,665 --> 00:49:47,225
Molly Fisher. Famous movie critic.

582
00:49:47,434 --> 00:49:49,902
On a scale of 1to 10,
10 being the best...

583
00:49:50,103 --> 00:49:52,367
... I'd have to rate this one an 8.

584
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:54,540
Harry, we found this.

585
00:49:55,275 --> 00:49:56,503
Thanks.

586
00:49:58,378 --> 00:49:59,538
Dead Pool.

587
00:49:59,813 --> 00:50:02,611
Molly Fisher's also
on Peter Swan's list.

588
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:41,951
Oh, God, it's coming!

589
00:50:43,824 --> 00:50:48,124
Those are just some of the highlights
of Peter Swan's films.

590
00:50:49,229 --> 00:50:53,359
The typeface is the same as those sent
to the papers and TV stations.

591
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:58,061
And the neighbor saw a man exiting
Molly Fisher's condo last night.

592
00:50:58,271 --> 00:51:00,796
Mid- 30s, wearing a black jacket.

593
00:51:01,074 --> 00:51:02,939
I want Swan in custody now.

594
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:04,542
It doesn't feel right.

595
00:51:04,745 --> 00:51:05,939
Doesn't feel right?

596
00:51:06,446 --> 00:51:09,973
Every celebrity on this list has
called in the last couple days.

597
00:51:10,183 --> 00:51:12,743
They're all screaming
for police protection.

598
00:51:12,953 --> 00:51:17,014
We don't have the manpower
to be 24- hour babysitters.

599
00:51:17,224 --> 00:51:22,184
Ackerman is whining about the negative
publicity this case is giving us.

600
00:51:22,395 --> 00:51:25,523
And your name
is on this list too, Callahan.

601
00:51:27,234 --> 00:51:30,965
My gut feeling tells me Swan is the
best suspect we have...

602
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:32,729
...so get his butt in here!

603
00:51:35,075 --> 00:51:36,235
Donnelly.

604
00:51:36,543 --> 00:51:37,567
What?

605
00:51:39,279 --> 00:51:41,713
It's for you, Callahan.

606
00:51:46,953 --> 00:51:48,716
We'll be right there.

607
00:51:49,089 --> 00:51:51,717
Wait a minute. Where are you going?

608
00:51:51,992 --> 00:51:54,984
To do my job.
I think we've got our man.

609
00:51:57,497 --> 00:51:59,124
You all stay back.

610
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,262
Everyone.

611
00:52:01,968 --> 00:52:03,060
I'm gonna go up.

612
00:52:04,404 --> 00:52:06,372
Where's the news crew?

613
00:52:08,441 --> 00:52:10,466
You better get them here.

614
00:52:12,112 --> 00:52:13,602
I mean it. Now!

615
00:52:19,753 --> 00:52:20,583
What's up?

616
00:52:20,787 --> 00:52:25,053
Name's Gus Wheeler.
He says he's the Dead Pool killer.

617
00:52:25,258 --> 00:52:26,919
We found him like this.

618
00:52:27,127 --> 00:52:31,029
He's soaked in gas and threatening
to set himself on fire.

619
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:32,664
Why not hose him down?

620
00:52:32,866 --> 00:52:37,030
He says if he sees a fireman or even
a garden hose, he'll torch himself.

621
00:52:37,838 --> 00:52:38,702
What's he want?

622
00:52:38,905 --> 00:52:40,566
To be on television.

623
00:52:40,907 --> 00:52:43,501
He wants a cameraman and a reporter.

624
00:52:43,710 --> 00:52:45,337
Al and I will just pose as--

625
00:52:45,545 --> 00:52:48,378
It has to be someone he recognizes.

626
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:02,785
Stay back. Stay back from me.

627
00:53:03,663 --> 00:53:05,460
It's gonna go up. You hear me?

628
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:07,964
Better keep those people back.

629
00:53:09,536 --> 00:53:11,470
- You all right?
- Not really.

630
00:53:11,671 --> 00:53:14,435
Stop right there! That's far enough.

631
00:53:15,342 --> 00:53:17,503
I'm Samantha Walker from--

632
00:53:17,711 --> 00:53:20,407
- I know who you are!
- What do you want?

633
00:53:22,482 --> 00:53:23,574
Is that camera on?

634
00:53:26,253 --> 00:53:28,483
You want to know why I'm doing this?

635
00:53:30,657 --> 00:53:32,249
Because nobody cares.

636
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:33,448
We care, Mr. Wheeler--

637
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:36,823
No! Nobody ever paid
any attention to me before.

638
00:53:37,097 --> 00:53:40,533
In order to get attention,
you gotta do something.

639
00:53:41,801 --> 00:53:45,669
Well, I'm really gonna
do something this time!

640
00:53:46,139 --> 00:53:49,199
Did you have anything
to do with the deaths...

641
00:53:49,409 --> 00:53:51,604
...of Johnny Squares and Molly Fisher?

642
00:53:51,811 --> 00:53:54,371
No, I just said that so you'd listen!

643
00:53:57,183 --> 00:53:59,674
I want everyone to see this!

644
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:02,620
I want everyone to remember me!

645
00:54:02,889 --> 00:54:05,483
And to remember what I did here!

646
00:54:12,599 --> 00:54:16,160
Oh, Jesus, Harry, he's
really gonna do it.

647
00:54:16,369 --> 00:54:20,738
That's right, lady. I'm really
gonna set myself on fire.

648
00:54:21,474 --> 00:54:23,738
And it's gonna be on the news...

649
00:54:24,144 --> 00:54:27,602
...and then finally everybody
will know about me.

650
00:54:27,814 --> 00:54:30,248
About me! Gus Wheeler!

651
00:54:32,852 --> 00:54:35,013
No one's going to see you die.

652
00:54:37,457 --> 00:54:38,287
What?

653
00:54:38,491 --> 00:54:41,221
I said, no one's gonna see you die.

654
00:54:41,594 --> 00:54:43,528
Not if we stop filming.

655
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:50,096
You can talk to me
and tell me your story...

656
00:54:50,303 --> 00:54:52,203
... but we won't film your suicide.

657
00:54:58,812 --> 00:54:59,642
What are you doing?

658
00:54:59,913 --> 00:55:02,711
- T urn the camera back on!
- We' re not gonna film it!

659
00:55:02,916 --> 00:55:05,350
- We' re not.
- She's right.

660
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:09,511
You can set yourself on fire
and we'll roast marshmallows.

661
00:55:09,723 --> 00:55:11,588
But you won't be on News at 11.

662
00:55:12,459 --> 00:55:14,518
You're ruining everything.

663
00:55:15,261 --> 00:55:16,626
Give me the flare.

664
00:55:16,863 --> 00:55:18,592
You've got plenty of coverage.

665
00:55:21,801 --> 00:55:22,859
You think so?

666
00:55:23,536 --> 00:55:24,525
T rust me.

667
00:55:33,279 --> 00:55:34,268
Okay.

668
00:55:50,330 --> 00:55:51,729
Harry, you okay?

669
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:55,367
- You hurt?
- No, I'm fine.

670
00:55:59,839 --> 00:56:01,739
Get that gurney over here, quick!

671
00:56:04,811 --> 00:56:05,641
You all right?

672
00:56:05,845 --> 00:56:08,211
Oh, God, Harry.

673
00:56:09,282 --> 00:56:12,615
This man sets himself on fire.

674
00:56:17,424 --> 00:56:18,448
And it's my fault.

675
00:56:18,658 --> 00:56:20,421
It was an accident.

676
00:56:22,695 --> 00:56:24,424
Maybe if we'd have kept filming.

677
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:26,758
That's exactly what he wanted.

678
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:32,568
What you did took guts. Most people
would have gone for the exclusive.

679
00:56:38,778 --> 00:56:40,575
Reel three, George.

680
00:56:44,084 --> 00:56:45,517
Just a moment.

681
00:56:45,985 --> 00:56:49,421
What is this? Why the fuck
are you harassing me?

682
00:56:49,622 --> 00:56:51,749
I was at a party when
Fisher was killed.

683
00:56:51,958 --> 00:56:54,984
I was there until 2,
and I have witnesses.

684
00:56:55,195 --> 00:56:56,685
We know that. We checked.

685
00:56:56,896 --> 00:57:02,095
Somebody's trying to make us think
that you killed Squares and Fisher.

686
00:57:04,037 --> 00:57:05,436
Any idea who it is?

687
00:57:05,638 --> 00:57:08,038
Are you kidding? It could be anyone.

688
00:57:08,641 --> 00:57:09,665
They all hate me.

689
00:57:09,876 --> 00:57:10,968
My former agent.

690
00:57:11,177 --> 00:57:14,510
My producers, my crew. The public.

691
00:57:14,714 --> 00:57:19,083
They envy my talent so much
they wish to destroy it.

692
00:57:21,654 --> 00:57:24,521
You don't believe me?
T alk to my secretary.

693
00:57:24,724 --> 00:57:28,785
She'll show you the letters I get.
Warnings, death threats....

694
00:57:28,995 --> 00:57:32,089
I get so many,
I don't pay attention anymore.

695
00:57:32,599 --> 00:57:34,089
I'll check on it.

696
00:57:34,767 --> 00:57:36,234
T ell me...

697
00:57:36,703 --> 00:57:39,672
...anyone else have
a jacket like this?

698
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:41,067
Most of my crew. Why?

699
00:57:41,274 --> 00:57:45,734
Maybe it was someone in your crew,
or who's worked for you in the past.

700
00:57:45,945 --> 00:57:50,439
Whoever's doing these murders uses
your films and you as inspiration.

701
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:56,519
Welcome to the Nolan lKennard Show.
Sex, violence, pornography:

702
00:57:56,723 --> 00:58:01,092
I say it's out of hand. It's time
we have guidelines for what we watch.

703
00:58:02,795 --> 00:58:07,061
I don't want Big Brother out there
telling me what to read or watch.

704
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:11,270
What's your opinion?

705
00:58:11,471 --> 00:58:14,099
Anybody can watch anything...

706
00:58:14,307 --> 00:58:17,140
...as long as it doesn't
hurt somebody else.

707
00:58:19,445 --> 00:58:21,140
Take it easy.

708
00:58:21,347 --> 00:58:23,281
Give me a chance here.

709
00:58:23,483 --> 00:58:25,917
Who decides what's harmful?

710
00:58:26,119 --> 00:58:28,383
Isn't that what we 're talking about?

711
00:59:55,908 --> 00:59:59,969
First Johnny Squares, then Molly
Fisher, now Nolan Kennard.

712
01:00:00,179 --> 01:00:04,673
- Like I said, celebrities always die--
- In threes, yeah.

713
01:00:05,918 --> 01:00:09,410
- At least the guy went out with a--
- A bang, I know.

714
01:00:11,958 --> 01:00:14,688
- What do you have, Russ?
- Hello, Harry.

715
01:00:14,894 --> 01:00:19,695
From the residue on the frags,
I'd say plastic. Probably C3 or 4.

716
01:00:19,899 --> 01:00:21,958
We'll do an analysis back at the lab.

717
01:00:22,168 --> 01:00:24,693
- Let me know the results.
- You got it.

718
01:00:31,311 --> 01:00:32,778
What's that?

719
01:00:32,979 --> 01:00:34,503
I don't know.

720
01:00:34,947 --> 01:00:37,643
It looks like the wheel from a toy.

721
01:00:45,191 --> 01:00:47,591
Have you been questioned about
Nolan Kennard?

722
01:00:47,794 --> 01:00:50,160
Is his death connected
to the Dead Pool?

723
01:00:50,363 --> 01:00:52,524
- I don't know.
- Is his death due to your list?

724
01:00:52,732 --> 01:00:54,791
- I don't know.
- In Hell Without the Devil...

725
01:00:55,001 --> 01:00:56,093
...a character's poisoned.

726
01:00:56,302 --> 01:00:58,998
Night of the Slasher
has several stabbings.

727
01:00:59,205 --> 01:01:02,003
- We can guess what Hotel Satan--
- Get to the point.

728
01:01:02,208 --> 01:01:05,507
Are there parallels between the deaths
in your film...

729
01:01:05,712 --> 01:01:07,577
...and the death of Johnny Squares?

730
01:01:07,780 --> 01:01:09,748
That's a stupid question!

731
01:01:09,949 --> 01:01:11,883
Do you feel any responsibility?

732
01:01:12,085 --> 01:01:14,679
You people are
blowing this out of proportion.

733
01:01:14,887 --> 01:01:18,220
You want to speak to somebody?
Speak to the police.

734
01:01:18,424 --> 01:01:22,588
Talk to Inspector Callahan.
He 'll tell you I'm not a suspect.

735
01:01:22,795 --> 01:01:24,922
I have nothing
to do with these deaths.

736
01:01:25,131 --> 01:01:27,497
That's all I have to say, now sod off.

737
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:29,561
Callahan!

738
01:02:06,172 --> 01:02:07,639
You.

739
01:02:42,208 --> 01:02:43,334
Harry.

740
01:02:46,112 --> 01:02:48,307
I think that's about it for me.

741
01:02:52,218 --> 01:02:53,480
What's that tattoo?

742
01:02:54,153 --> 01:02:55,780
Oh, that.

743
01:02:55,988 --> 01:02:58,286
One of my grandfather's superstitions.

744
01:02:58,491 --> 01:03:02,154
You see, he painted these words
on my back and chest.

745
01:03:02,361 --> 01:03:05,990
It's supposed to ward off
anything that's harmful or evil.

746
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:10,533
When he heard I was your partner,
he figured I could use the help.

747
01:03:10,736 --> 01:03:12,966
I was just trying
to honor the old guy.

748
01:03:13,706 --> 01:03:16,504
Besides, I didn't think it could hurt.

749
01:03:17,243 --> 01:03:19,711
Listen, I think I'm gonna go home.

750
01:03:19,912 --> 01:03:22,278
I'll catch you later for a beer.

751
01:03:59,051 --> 01:04:00,951
- See him?
- I saw him.

752
01:04:39,592 --> 01:04:41,150
He can't be over there.

753
01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:43,251
How y'all doing?

754
01:04:59,512 --> 01:05:01,605
You' re the last asshole Janero sends.

755
01:05:01,814 --> 01:05:03,145
Wait, you got it wrong!

756
01:05:03,349 --> 01:05:06,682
Don't fuck with me, buddy.
I'll kick your ass right now.

757
01:05:06,886 --> 01:05:08,114
It's not what you think.

758
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:10,289
Janero did hire us.

759
01:05:10,489 --> 01:05:12,354
But this ain't a hit.

760
01:05:12,558 --> 01:05:16,221
Janero doesn't want
anything to happen to you.

761
01:05:16,429 --> 01:05:17,361
We're your...

762
01:05:18,264 --> 01:05:19,356
... bodyguards.

763
01:05:30,176 --> 01:05:32,940
Those letters
all came from your files.

764
01:05:33,346 --> 01:05:35,871
Harlan Rook. God.

765
01:05:36,082 --> 01:05:37,447
Yes, I remember him.

766
01:05:37,650 --> 01:05:42,144
Every time I was at a film festival
or a seminar, he was there.

767
01:05:42,355 --> 01:05:46,587
Mr. I Know- It- All, I called him.
He knew everything about my films.

768
01:05:48,094 --> 01:05:51,530
To tell the truth,
I found it a little unnerving.

769
01:05:52,398 --> 01:05:53,888
What'd he want?

770
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:55,997
He had this screenplay...

771
01:05:56,202 --> 01:05:58,397
...for a horror film
he wanted me to direct.

772
01:05:58,604 --> 01:06:01,300
He said it'd be
the ultimate Peter Swan film.

773
01:06:01,507 --> 01:06:03,475
He was crazy.
I couldn't get rid of him.

774
01:06:03,676 --> 01:06:07,168
Finally, my attorney
put a restraining order on him.

775
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:08,574
Then what happened?

776
01:06:08,781 --> 01:06:10,874
I didn't see or hear from him again.

777
01:06:11,083 --> 01:06:13,950
That must have been over a year ago.

778
01:06:15,388 --> 01:06:16,355
Is he the one?

779
01:06:16,555 --> 01:06:18,785
The typewriter
used on these letters...

780
01:06:18,991 --> 01:06:22,518
...is the same one used
to tip us off to the Dead Pool.

781
01:06:27,133 --> 01:06:30,432
Call Swan's attorney
and see what he knows about Rook.

782
01:06:30,636 --> 01:06:32,433
And run a DMV check.

783
01:06:32,638 --> 01:06:33,764
Right.

784
01:07:01,567 --> 01:07:05,833
It might not be a bad idea to start
playing it a little safe.

785
01:07:06,038 --> 01:07:08,233
Maybe your granddaddy can paint me up.

786
01:07:08,441 --> 01:07:10,306
Look, I'm being serious.

787
01:07:10,509 --> 01:07:14,445
Don't go where you normally go,
not even home. You can stay with me.

788
01:07:14,914 --> 01:07:18,077
Thanks, but I think I can
do a little better.

789
01:07:28,961 --> 01:07:30,485
Price of fame.

790
01:08:00,726 --> 01:08:04,253
Is this what Ackerman meant
by cooperating with the press?

791
01:08:04,463 --> 01:08:07,864
It must have been one of those
in- depth interviews.

792
01:08:18,778 --> 01:08:21,941
I got a lead on Rook.
A psychiatrist who treated him.

793
01:08:22,148 --> 01:08:23,376
Good.

794
01:08:26,452 --> 01:08:27,544
- Give it a try.
- Okay.

795
01:08:32,925 --> 01:08:35,985
It won't respond.
Someone's on my frequency.

796
01:08:49,141 --> 01:08:51,701
Forget it. It's just not working.

797
01:09:22,208 --> 01:09:24,073
Now what the hell is that?

798
01:12:43,042 --> 01:12:45,101
Time's up, Callahan.

799
01:13:22,548 --> 01:13:24,106
You all right, Al?

800
01:13:24,483 --> 01:13:26,007
Shit.

801
01:13:39,064 --> 01:13:40,656
Two fractured ribs.

802
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:44,192
He bled in the chest.
We drained it and set up an IV.

803
01:13:44,403 --> 01:13:48,169
He's lucky, the bulletproof vest
he had on saved his life.

804
01:13:49,041 --> 01:13:51,635
Another of my
grandfather's superstitions.

805
01:13:51,844 --> 01:13:53,903
When your partner gives you advice...

806
01:13:54,113 --> 01:13:55,080
...take it.

807
01:13:56,315 --> 01:13:57,782
Harry.

808
01:14:06,358 --> 01:14:10,192
This is Dr. Friedman, chief
psychiatrist here at the hospital.

809
01:14:10,395 --> 01:14:12,056
I'm sorry about what happened.

810
01:14:12,264 --> 01:14:14,061
I feel somewhat responsible.

811
01:14:14,266 --> 01:14:17,394
Your partner contacted me about
a former patient of ours.

812
01:14:17,603 --> 01:14:19,127
- Harlan Rook?
- Yes.

813
01:14:19,338 --> 01:14:23,001
At first, I didn't recall the name.
I found the file today.

814
01:14:23,775 --> 01:14:25,868
He was evaluated here a year ago.

815
01:14:26,078 --> 01:14:28,546
The diagnosis was
process schizophrenia.

816
01:14:28,747 --> 01:14:30,180
Multiple personality.

817
01:14:30,382 --> 01:14:31,212
Exactly.

818
01:14:31,884 --> 01:14:33,852
His sense of self- hate
was so strong...

819
01:14:34,052 --> 01:14:37,146
...that he no longer had
any personality of his own.

820
01:14:37,356 --> 01:14:40,814
Consequently,
he substituted identities...

821
01:14:41,026 --> 01:14:43,494
...found in books, films...

822
01:14:43,695 --> 01:14:45,128
...fan magazines.

823
01:14:45,330 --> 01:14:48,356
Identities with which he had
love- hate relationships.

824
01:14:48,567 --> 01:14:50,933
He wasn't dangerous enough to hold?

825
01:14:51,136 --> 01:14:54,537
Most mentally ill people
are not violent, inspector.

826
01:14:54,740 --> 01:14:59,404
By law, a person who poses no danger
can only be held for 72 hours.

827
01:15:00,445 --> 01:15:04,245
I'm sorry, this is one instance
where the system failed.

828
01:15:04,449 --> 01:15:06,212
Is this address recent?

829
01:15:06,418 --> 01:15:07,851
I assume it's still the same.

830
01:15:11,957 --> 01:15:13,151
Samantha Walker.

831
01:15:13,358 --> 01:15:15,417
This is Peter Swan, Ms. Walker.

832
01:15:15,627 --> 01:15:18,460
Your coverage of my predicament
has been thorough...

833
01:15:18,664 --> 01:15:22,156
...but my side hasn't been told
as well as it could be.

834
01:15:22,367 --> 01:15:23,629
I see.

835
01:15:23,835 --> 01:15:26,963
I'm prepared to grant you
an exclusive interview.

836
01:15:27,172 --> 01:15:29,072
Are you interested?

837
01:15:33,979 --> 01:15:35,446
No doubt about it.

838
01:15:35,647 --> 01:15:36,978
He's our boy, Harry.

839
01:15:37,182 --> 01:15:40,310
Explosives. Caps.

840
01:15:40,519 --> 01:15:41,645
Detonator.

841
01:15:41,853 --> 01:15:42,911
It all connects.

842
01:15:43,488 --> 01:15:45,456
Harry, you gotta see this.

843
01:15:50,329 --> 01:15:51,990
Talk about obsession.

844
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:12,377
Looks like he had a real
Peter Swan shrine going here.

845
01:16:15,153 --> 01:16:17,018
I'm not sure.

846
01:16:17,222 --> 01:16:19,622
I could have sworn I put it in my bag.

847
01:16:19,825 --> 01:16:21,884
But I'm not sure.

848
01:16:22,094 --> 01:16:25,621
- Bob, do you have my little mike?
- It's in your bag.

849
01:16:25,831 --> 01:16:27,230
Thank you.

850
01:17:05,804 --> 01:17:06,964
Look at this.

851
01:17:10,008 --> 01:17:12,169
I'll call the TV station.

852
01:17:24,389 --> 01:17:28,291
Samantha went out to the shipyard
to interview Peter Swan.

853
01:17:28,493 --> 01:17:30,586
Swan doesn't know anything about it.

854
01:17:30,796 --> 01:17:33,026
- What's this?
- A payroll stub.

855
01:17:33,231 --> 01:17:36,530
Sundown Security, made out to
Ed Butler? I don't get it.

856
01:17:36,735 --> 01:17:40,466
That's the company that provides
security for Swan's locations.

857
01:17:40,672 --> 01:17:43,368
Ed Butler may be an alias for Rook.

858
01:17:43,575 --> 01:17:45,702
Where are you going? Harry?

859
01:17:45,911 --> 01:17:47,640
Harry!

860
01:17:47,846 --> 01:17:49,711
That's my car!

861
01:17:57,689 --> 01:17:58,519
Yes.

862
01:17:58,724 --> 01:18:00,624
That's the shot I'm looking for.

863
01:18:12,137 --> 01:18:13,934
What is it you want from me?

864
01:18:14,139 --> 01:18:16,505
You've got it wrong, love.

865
01:18:17,142 --> 01:18:19,167
This is what you wanted.

866
01:18:19,478 --> 01:18:22,242
An exclusive interview.

867
01:18:23,148 --> 01:18:24,410
But you' re not Swan.

868
01:18:24,616 --> 01:18:26,641
Shut up! You don't know!

869
01:18:26,852 --> 01:18:28,979
You don't know!

870
01:18:29,821 --> 01:18:31,516
I know who I am.

871
01:18:32,190 --> 01:18:33,623
Do you know who you are?

872
01:18:34,025 --> 01:18:34,855
Do you?!

873
01:18:35,060 --> 01:18:36,425
Yes.

874
01:18:36,795 --> 01:18:38,262
All those films he made.

875
01:18:38,463 --> 01:18:40,658
Those are my nightmares, not his!

876
01:18:41,433 --> 01:18:45,494
Every night I dream,
and somehow he reads my mind.

877
01:18:45,704 --> 01:18:47,865
He stole my thoughts.

878
01:18:48,073 --> 01:18:52,669
He put my thoughts on film,
and he takes all the credit.

879
01:18:54,780 --> 01:18:56,805
He can't get away with it.

880
01:18:59,451 --> 01:19:01,248
He has to pay.

881
01:19:07,392 --> 01:19:09,519
He stole my nightmares
and made them real.

882
01:19:09,728 --> 01:19:11,593
So I stole his Dead Pool.

883
01:19:12,097 --> 01:19:14,691
I'll play his game and make it real.

884
01:19:17,235 --> 01:19:18,930
He can take credit for that.

885
01:20:44,823 --> 01:20:45,755
Drop it, Rook.

886
01:20:45,957 --> 01:20:50,189
You didn't die, Callahan,
so I had to find another celebrity.

887
01:20:54,699 --> 01:20:55,597
You're next.

888
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:58,234
Shoot me, Callahan.

889
01:20:58,436 --> 01:20:59,994
Maybe you'll get lucky.

890
01:21:00,205 --> 01:21:04,164
Maybe my muscles won't contract
and drive this knife into her throat.

891
01:21:05,744 --> 01:21:06,768
Let her go.

892
01:21:07,612 --> 01:21:08,909
First the gun.

893
01:21:09,114 --> 01:21:11,241
Drop it and kick it over to me.

894
01:21:15,353 --> 01:21:17,082
Time's up. What's it gonna be?

895
01:21:25,697 --> 01:21:26,959
What the fuck?

896
01:21:31,836 --> 01:21:34,168
You've locked yourself in, asshole.

897
01:21:34,706 --> 01:21:36,105
Yeah.

898
01:21:36,308 --> 01:21:38,105
Just you and me, asshole.

899
01:21:40,845 --> 01:21:42,278
The gun, Callahan.

900
01:21:44,149 --> 01:21:44,979
Now!

901
01:21:45,183 --> 01:21:46,047
No!

902
01:21:46,251 --> 01:21:47,946
He'll kill us both!

903
01:21:50,655 --> 01:21:52,020
Oh, God.

904
01:22:02,233 --> 01:22:05,999
You let me down,
Mr. Famous- Fucking- Cop.

905
01:22:06,371 --> 01:22:08,032
You let Swan get away.

906
01:22:08,239 --> 01:22:09,831
You're the killer, not Swan.

907
01:22:10,141 --> 01:22:11,870
I should have killed you first.

908
01:22:12,077 --> 01:22:14,045
That was my big mistake.

909
01:22:14,346 --> 01:22:15,643
Now kick it over to me.

910
01:22:17,515 --> 01:22:19,483
Harry, don't.

911
01:22:28,393 --> 01:22:29,951
Think you're smart, don't you?

912
01:22:47,145 --> 01:22:49,010
Callahan, you son of a bitch!

913
01:22:54,986 --> 01:22:56,817
I'm gonna kill you slow!

914
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:03,951
Do you hear that, Callahan?!

915
01:24:20,805 --> 01:24:22,534
Stay in there.

916
01:25:31,743 --> 01:25:33,608
Callahan!

917
01:25:41,219 --> 01:25:43,414
Come on out, Callahan.

918
01:25:56,234 --> 01:25:58,600
There's nowhere left to run, Callahan.

919
01:25:59,537 --> 01:26:01,562
Don't make me come in and get you.

920
01:26:05,410 --> 01:26:07,037
The game's over!

921
01:26:07,245 --> 01:26:08,610
You' re out of bullets.

922
01:26:38,443 --> 01:26:40,035
You know what that means.

923
01:26:42,146 --> 01:26:43,545
You' re shit out of luck.

924
01:27:28,726 --> 01:27:31,627
- Where's Rook?
- He's hanging out back there.

925
01:27:37,101 --> 01:27:40,002
Inspector, was this another
hit attempt by Janero?

926
01:27:40,204 --> 01:27:42,764
Is it connected to the Dead Pool case?
