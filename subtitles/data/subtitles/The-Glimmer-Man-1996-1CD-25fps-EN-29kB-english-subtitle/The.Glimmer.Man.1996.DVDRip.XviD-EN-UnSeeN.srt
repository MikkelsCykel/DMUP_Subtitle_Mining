1
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,558
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey, it's Chicken-Noodle Campbell.

2
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,119
Shouldn't you be sittin' in a high chair?

3
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,394
Coroner's report.

4
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,232
Why don't you just try crack?

5
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,673
You call that humor?

6
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,035
The Captain says no more 976 calls.

7
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,676
Mr. Love Beads, you'll have to seek
higher enlightenment somewhere else.

8
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,830
I'm Lieutenant Cole.
Been assigned to the case.

9
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,273
They asked me to come
and look at the file.

10
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,430
Didn't mean to be discourteous.
Nice to meet you.

11
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,795
I heard about you.
I wasn't expecting you so soon.

12
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,633
You worked in New York, right?
DeMarco killings?

13
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,519
This ain't New York
and this ain't the DeMarco killings.

14
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,511
We work as a team around here.

15
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,429
You know, the way I work is
I just like to solve the case.

16
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,590
I don't even care who gets the credit.

17
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,636
Beautiful. That's that.

18
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,833
We call this guy, "The Family Man."

19
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,434
He's killed six families
in the last eight months.

20
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,748
All ritual killings.

21
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,752
Have you found any connection
between the victims at all?

22
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,149
Other than the fact
that they're all Catholic...

23
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,356
...which ties into the crucifixion ritual, no.

24
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,431
They just found two more.

25
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,432
Fresh kill. Today's your lucky day.
Let's go.

26
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,072
This ain't the same, Jim.

27
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,355
Yeah, this is the first one in a motel.

28
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,189
All the rest have taken place
in their houses.

29
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,555
Normally, we can ID the couple, but...

30
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,633
...other than that,
it's pretty much the same MO.

31
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,554
No, there's a lot more than that goin' on.
I mean, this is different.

32
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,998
Are you married or what?

33
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,036
This is what I hate about new partners.

34
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,190
They always want to get personal.

35
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,434
I don't want to talk about it, all right?

36
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,360
Forget that I ever mentioned
anything at all.

37
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,672
Are you married, or what?

38
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,233
No, I'm not married.

39
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,671
Every cop I know who's married,
has a wife who won't sleep with him...

40
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,909
...two kids who don't listen to him...

41
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,434
...and a dog that'd rather lick himself
than fetch the paper.

42
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,193
<i>All units respond to a barricaded suspect</i>
<i>with hostages...</i>

43
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,679
<i>... at the Saint Edmund's School.</i>

44
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,320
- <i>Possible suicide.</i>
- Yeah, we're in that area.

45
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,239
- Hey, what are you doin'?
- It's right over here.

46
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,675
No, man. That's suicide. We're Homicide.

47
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,513
If some dumb ass wants to jump
off a buildin', that's his problem.

48
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,989
Somebody pushes his ass off a buildin',
then call me.

49
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,674
The way I look at it, death is death.

50
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,195
We gotta have compassion for the dead,
the dying...

51
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,316
...the could-be-dying
and the about-to-be-dead.

52
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,958
I'm going. I'm going.

53
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,836
Faster, come on. Quickly, quickly.

54
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,476
Detective Cole. Detective Campbell.
What have we got?

55
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,391
A boy named Johnny Deverell.
He's a senior.

56
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,391
He's got a gun and a class full of kids.

57
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,515
That's nice.

58
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,477
- What does he want?
- I don't know.

59
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,870
His girlfriend broke up with him.
He's got her up there too.

60
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,798
Has he been in trouble before?

61
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,599
He was arrested for drugs.
They had him seeing a therapist.

62
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,069
Yeah, must have been the wrong therapist.

63
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,794
Keep everybody quiet.
Keep everybody back.

64
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,071
Man, you know this ain't our gig.

65
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,593
Look, it's a love-sick kid.

66
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,319
A well-armed, love-sick kid.
Why do you think they got SWAT?

67
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,038
'Cause they look good in black.

68
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,715
See if you can get me a couple
of cell phones right away.

69
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,639
Johnny, please stop it.
They're gonna hurt you.

70
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,076
Shut your mouth, Millie!
I'm not in the mood for this!

71
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,229
Put the gun down, Johnny.

72
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,390
- Just put it down!
- Shut up!

73
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,750
Johnny, stop it! Please, Johnny!

74
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,075
<i>This is Detective Cole, LAPD.</i>

75
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,479
I'm not here to hurt you.
I'm here to help you.

76
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,232
I gotta get into a dialogue with you...

77
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:01,313
<i>... before the guys in black get here,</i>
<i>'cause they don't listen to anybody.</i>

78
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,117
<i>I don't want you to get hurt.</i>

79
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,118
<i>I want you to step over to the window</i>
<i>and look at me.</i>

80
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,351
<i>You'll see that I'm unarmed.</i>

81
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,399
Nobody move!

82
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,636
<i>Come on over. Step over to the window</i>
<i>and look at me.</i>

83
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,515
Sorry, Johnny. Put the gun down.

84
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,955
I don't want to shoot you,
and you don't want to be dead.

85
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,995
Why not?

86
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,798
Drop the gun! Come on.

87
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,159
What are you on?

88
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,918
Don't talk to me like you know me!

89
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,911
You want me to start shooting?

90
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,318
You're right, I don't know you.

91
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,197
I'm gonna put my gun down.

92
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,278
We'll start out like this.

93
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,958
Now, what's the problem?

94
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,838
You don't understand, man.

95
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,959
You don't understand.
I can't go back with him.

96
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,709
I can't, I won't.

97
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,516
With who?

98
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,637
You don't understand.
I can't go back with him.

99
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,636
With who?

100
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,392
I can't. I won't.

101
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,273
I love you, Johnny!

102
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,073
I love you, too.

103
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,193
I love you, too.

104
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,233
I hate this job.

105
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,559
- Calm down, son.
- Wait!

106
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,790
Watch your head. Calm down.

107
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,710
Now, you see?
SWAT would have killed this boy.

108
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,552
You know it, and I know it.

109
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,149
- You're not a freelancer, okay?
- Oh, no.

110
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,039
This ain't New York.

111
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,075
No shit.

112
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,150
Frank Deverell. It figures.

113
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,191
Rich people's kids are always fucked up.

114
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,396
Lieutenant, where will I find
Detective Cole?

115
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,710
- Right down there, sir.
- Thank you.

116
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,432
- Detective Cole?
- Yes, sir.

117
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,714
I'd like to thank you
from the bottom of my heart...

118
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,473
...for not letting my stepson
take his own life.

119
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,393
You look like a very sincere individual,
and I...

120
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,316
...really appreciate your coming down.
So nice of you.

121
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,679
Well, I sincerely hope that
if there's ever anything I can do for you...

122
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,751
...you won't hesitate to ask me.

123
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,396
You'll be the first one I dial.

124
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,358
Let's get out of here.

125
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,755
Nice coat.

126
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,870
Detective Cole, can I have a minute?

127
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,075
I'm kind of busy right now.

128
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,470
I'll be very brief. Mr. Deverell asked me
to speak to you...

129
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,551
...on behalf of his stepson.

130
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,915
About what?

131
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,719
Mr. Deverell feels your testimony
would be very helpful...

132
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,872
...in getting Johnny acquitted on grounds
of temporary insanity.

133
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:05,157
There's a little problem.
First of all, I don't think he's insane.

134
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,391
Second of all, I like to testify
as to what actually happened.

135
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,879
Look, Detective...

136
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,071
...Johnny's been going
through a very difficult time.

137
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,515
He needs treatment, not prison.

138
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,750
Now, Mr. Deverell, as you may know...

139
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:25,549
...he's a very important man,
and a man with a lot of influence...

140
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,154
...a man who could help or hurt a career.

141
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,634
Just what is it that you do for this man?

142
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,674
I'm in charge of Mr. Deverell's security.

143
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,799
Could have fooled me.
I thought you were an attorney.

144
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,916
I want you to deliver a message for me.

145
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,754
You tell your asshole boss that nobody,
nobody threatens me.

146
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,990
I understand. I'll convey your feelings
to Mr. Deverell.

147
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,510
Now get your ugly, white ass out of here.
And don't come back.

148
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,278
The motel victim had some problems...

149
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,430
...I thought you might want to know about.

150
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,034
Besides bein' shot in the head
and crucified?

151
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,076
What are you gonna tell me,
she had a bad-hair day?

152
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,799
She would have been dead
in a couple of months.

153
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,509
From what?

154
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,555
I found advanced osteosarcoma
and interstitial fibrosis.

155
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,876
If you don't say it in English, I'll beat you
to death with a dictionary.

156
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:26,953
It's a rare form of bone cancer, and this
cancer had spread throughout her body.

157
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,395
- What'd cause that?
- What am I? The Amazing Randy?

158
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,869
We have tests to run, it will take time.

159
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,918
What'd you come up with on prints?

160
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,514
Nothing. I don't think she's local.

161
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,713
Neither do I.
I don't even think she's American.

162
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,638
I think she's Russian.

163
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,679
Wait, I thought he was the Amazing Randy.

164
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,592
Hair... cheekbones...

165
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,799
...genetic bone structure.
I think she's Russian, most likely Georgian.

166
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,800
You can tell all that just by lookin' at her?

167
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,309
Right. She's an Aquarius
and likes country music.

168
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,753
Was... an Aquarian.

169
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,150
You see, the spirit has left the body.

170
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,118
What we have here
is a mere broken vessel.

171
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:07,996
"A broken vessel?"

172
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:12,119
Anything else interesting about the body
that you'd like to comment on or...

173
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,359
She's got nice tits.

174
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,358
Precisely, Grasshopper,
but a little bit too nice.

175
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,396
Okay, partner, run this number.

176
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,520
Detective Cole's not gonna cooperate.

177
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,396
That's the problem with new cops.

178
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,593
They need to be taught
who to pay attention to.

179
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,355
I'd be happy to teach him that lesson.

180
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,030
Put some of our Russian friends on it.

181
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,549
Let them earn their money for a change.

182
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,191
Everything else in shape?

183
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,428
Like clockwork.

184
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,474
Everyone's still in the dark?

185
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:13,473
It's a very tight seal, as long
as everyone keeps their mouth shut.

186
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,789
They will.

187
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,869
I think we've set a very good example.

188
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,868
So, why LA? New York didn't have
enough psychopaths for you?

189
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,311
I didn't get along with my captain.

190
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:43,188
Figured it was time for a change.
The ex moved out here with the kids.

191
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,070
Yeah. Y'all just go on...

192
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,750
No, thank you, I don't know you that well.

193
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,239
No, that's tea. That's good stuff.

194
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,153
It's deer antler. It's good
for your masculinity.

195
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,549
Ain't nothin' wrong with my manhood,
thank you.

196
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,551
Let me just have a little sip.

197
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,916
This is my favorite movie.

198
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,910
Do you know I'm black?
I have no idea what you're saying.

199
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,157
She says that movie always makes her cry.

200
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,356
Yeah, that's a real tearjerker.

201
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,677
Not that I cry at movies
or anything like that.

202
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,357
It takes more than a sad scene
to break me, you know what I mean?

203
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,000
Once in a while you should cry
'cause it cleanses the soul.

204
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,672
You could use a little bit of that.

205
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,752
If I need cleansing, I have a bran muffin.
Thank you.

206
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,991
You ain't gonna find one here.

207
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,476
Shit.

208
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,676
I think I'm allergic to the incense.

209
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,310
Y'all sell roaches?
Damn, I'm in the wrong business.

210
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,517
I could make money
and never leave my apartment.

211
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,798
Just put this underneath your tongue.

212
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,838
It's perfect for allergies.
It'll clear you right up.

213
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,548
This is bitter.

214
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,153
Bitter? I don't know why it'd be bitter.

215
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,434
What is this?

216
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,918
It's just a little bit of powdered deer penis.

217
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:22,111
That's real funny. That's real fuckin' funny.
Damn, do I feel violated.

218
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,036
So tell me, what's up with the beads?

219
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:37,590
These here? It's called a mahla.
Tibetan prayer beads.

220
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,189
What do you use 'em for?

221
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:42,511
I use them to calm my mind
and to purify my thoughts.

222
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,312
Yeah, I use Jack Daniel's.

223
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,992
We're tryin' to go to the same place.

224
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,389
We're just using a different technique.

225
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,391
Except I don't wear the bottle
around my neck.

226
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,040
That's because you'd lose your job
if you did.

227
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,078
<i>Roden to 4 King 63.</i>
<i>Just got a call from an informant...</i>

228
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,469
<i>... who claims to have info</i>
<i>on The Family Man.</i>

229
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,949
<i>Says he'll only give it to you.</i>
<i>Waitin' on the south dock.</i>

230
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,270
This is 4 King 63. We're on our way.

231
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,352
They're breakin' into a car over there.

232
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,318
We're here to meet an informant.
We don't have time for that.

233
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,470
We're police. We gotta get the bad guys
once in a while.

234
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,994
Why don't we get you
some red boots and a cape...

235
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,277
...and you can fly around the city
and stop all the crime?

236
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,314
Police! Freeze!

237
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,791
You know what pisses me off? When I see
some sorry-ass motherfuckers...

238
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,472
...like you with more hair than me.

239
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,790
Turn around, put your goddamn hands
on the car...

240
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,155
...before I go get my clippers
and go crazy in here.

241
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,559
Fuck you, pig.

242
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,236
"Fuck you?" Did he say, "Fuck you"?

243
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,357
I'm confused. We got the badges.
We got the guns.

244
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,318
You got a screwdriver.

245
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,199
It's kind of like takin' a screwdriver
to a gunfight.

246
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,271
And "pig," that's an old phrase.

247
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:08,512
Y'all must not be from around here.
Y'all must be from another country...

248
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,311
Drop the guns. Please.

249
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,518
This is a police matter.
It's got nothin' to do with you.

250
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,033
Drop the guns.

251
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,399
Think we're gonna have to do this
the hard way.

252
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,673
I can't fight, man.

253
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:27,469
What do you mean you can't fight?
It's a fine time to tell me now.

254
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,437
Get down on your knees. Now.

255
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,996
He likes you, that's the good news.

256
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,875
Sorry. Not without dinner and a movie.

257
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,990
Your friend likes to do things the hard way.
Now, how about you?

258
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:49,039
My friend, he's a little bit country,
I'm a little bit rock-n'-roll.

259
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,348
What does that mean?

260
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,034
Just an expression. What do you want?

261
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,793
You... dead.

262
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:56,790
Why?

263
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,712
Because the pay is so good.

264
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,310
How about if I double the pay?

265
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:08,595
You have balls. But I don't think
you have enough money.

266
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,315
Well, I do.

267
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,476
I got thousands of dollars in my pocket.

268
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,870
I'm gonna reach into my back pocket
slowly to get my wallet.

269
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,638
I have a lot of cash...

270
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,796
...or you could take plastic.

271
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,069
"Plastic?"

272
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,993
This is rock-n'-roll.

273
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,199
For a minute I forgot you said
you can't fight.

274
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,508
It's not that I can't fight.

275
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,034
I'm not supposed to.
It's against my religion.

276
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,553
- Great.
- I'm a Buddhist.

277
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,596
Yeah. You're a Kung Fu priest.

278
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,959
Who sent you, man?

279
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,239
The Russian Mafia.

280
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,393
- Let me try.
- You speak Russian?

281
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,674
A little bit.

282
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,594
Answer me, goddamn it, before I beat
the shit out of you, you dumb ass!

283
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,033
- You speak good Russian.
- Yes. Black Russian.

284
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,917
Read him his rights even though
he's a little unconscious.

285
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,709
He knows 'em.

286
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,190
I'm tellin' you, Captain, this guy is weird.

287
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,633
Yeah, show me a cop who isn't.

288
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,280
Look, I'm not talkin' about a cop
who wears pantyhose.

289
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,796
This guy, he speaks Chinese,
he dresses like a monk...

290
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:00,319
...and the Russians yesterday, he took
those guys out like Bruce Lee, only better.

291
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,551
I mean, I saw him use his credit card
like a goddamn Ginsu knife.

292
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,073
Where would you learn that?

293
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,513
I don't know, maybe the Army.

294
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,478
What do you want me to do, Jim,
look at his resume?

295
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,230
Don't come to me with this kind of shit.
Just work with the guy.

296
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,839
"Work with the guy."

297
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,473
What does this say to you?

298
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,551
Punishment and purification.

299
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,709
He believes he's helping these people
by turnin' them into martyrs.

300
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,428
Only he can't get any satisfaction.

301
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,636
So he keeps doin' it,
gettin' bolder and bolder...

302
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,995
...until he's either caught or killed.

303
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,272
And he ain't gettin' his orders
from the Devil, either.

304
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,590
He believes he's listenin' to Jesus himself.

305
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,511
You learn well, Grasshopper.

306
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,839
Task force, Campbell.

307
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,915
All right.

308
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,599
Two more bodies.

309
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,155
Hey, slow down.

310
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,674
It's all right, man, we'll be back later.

311
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,760
Hey, man, get this virgin
off the crime scene.

312
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:57,148
We got Andrew Dunleavy, a psychiatrist.

313
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,629
This is his wife Ellen.
There are two children...

314
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,438
...but we haven't been able to locate them.

315
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,476
Roden, squash that, man.

316
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,392
Are you all right, Jack?

317
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,431
- Jim, you got a minute?
- Sure.

318
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,398
Careful, he wants to borrow money.
I know that look.

319
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,517
- Got somethin' for you to look at.
- What is it?

320
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:35,271
Found a print at the Dunleavy scene,
on the woman's body.

321
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,271
Beautiful. It's about time.

322
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,194
- Let's run it right away.
- Already did.

323
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,269
It's Cole's.

324
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,353
Your brother still works
for Intelligence, right?

325
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,799
Tell him to find out everything he can
on Cole.

326
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,399
Off the record.

327
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,553
We'll extend the house-to-house canvas
by four blocks.

328
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:13,315
We're lookin' for any links
between the victims. Where they shop...

329
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,193
...get their cars repaired,
pictures developed...

330
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,077
...anything, no matter how small.

331
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:21,516
Do me a favor and get me copies
of these blood paintings on the walls...

332
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,318
...in this stack of crime-scene photos.

333
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,472
Send 'em out to every psych ward
and prison throughout the US.

334
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,198
Maybe a former patient.

335
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,590
I don't know, I just think that...

336
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:34,070
...this work is so unique that any prisoner,
psychiatrist or priest...

337
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,639
...would definitely not forget it.

338
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,676
All right, everybody knows what to do.

339
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,795
Let's go.

340
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,393
No, I understand.

341
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,831
I'll get there as fast as I can.

342
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,835
Thanks.

343
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,558
Hey, you're home early.

344
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,109
What's up?

345
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:13,152
I have a new patient. They don't think
she has a long time to live, so...

346
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,633
What's wrong?

347
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,757
There's been another killing.

348
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,675
Same guy?

349
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,516
Yeah.

350
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,959
I'm sorry, Jack.

351
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,191
He killed Ellen and her husband.

352
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,509
He did what?

353
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:38,357
I gotta go tell my kids
that their mother is dead.

354
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,599
Jesus, Jack!

355
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,868
I think he's makin' it personal, you know?

356
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,232
Westlake Security.

357
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,754
I'd like you to tell Mr. Smith
that Mr. Jones needs to contact him...

358
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,839
...right away.

359
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,676
I think there may be a problem.

360
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,799
Spit it out, son.

361
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,474
Mr. Jones, he's asking to see you.

362
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,550
Really?

363
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,276
I wonder what took him so long?

364
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,397
What would you like me to do?

365
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,513
Ignore him.

366
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,912
He's being dealt with.

367
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,435
And we have bigger fish to fry.

368
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,433
Whatever you say.

369
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,549
"Ten Ways To Spend Your Weekend."

370
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,590
This is all we could get on Cole.

371
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,189
Let's see.

372
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,995
NYPD, Homicide, Task Force Command
on the DeMarco serial killings.

373
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,831
Lots of medals, good cop.

374
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,990
He tracked down the DeMarco killer...

375
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,877
...shot him on a rooftop, one-on-one...

376
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,838
...and then was busted for actin'
without sanction.

377
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,791
Two coffees, Raffi. Extra sugar.

378
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,189
- No coffee for me.
- They're both for me.

379
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,954
Anything else?

380
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,671
Nothin' in the military records.

381
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:16,596
Almost nothin' before the NYPD.
Looks like this guy came out of nowhere.

382
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:19,399
Are you tellin' me we don't know nothin'
about this guy?

383
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,789
Yeah, there's one thing we know for sure.

384
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,394
He used to be married
to the Dunleavy woman.

385
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,388
Son of a bitch.

386
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:32,479
"In my Father's house,
there are many rooms. If it were not so...

387
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,509
"...would I have told you that I go
to prepare a place for you?

388
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:40,676
"Thomas said to him, 'Lord,
we do not know where you are going.'

389
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:43,229
"Jesus said to him, 'I am the way...

390
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:47,712
"'... and the truth and the life,
no one comes to the Father, but by me."'

391
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:01,559
Why didn't you tell anybody
it was your ex-wife?

392
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,633
You know they would have pulled me
off the case.

393
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,836
You should've told me.
We're workin' together.

394
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,148
Well, I didn't.

395
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,955
We ID'd the couple at the motel.
Eugene and Sonya Roslov.

396
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,071
Russian, just like you said.

397
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,152
Any connection to the others?

398
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,310
No. They weren't even Catholic.

399
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,030
There goes that theory. What's next?

400
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,039
This is empty.

401
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,510
It's everything we know about you.

402
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,830
Your background's nothin' but smoke
and mirrors.

403
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,796
Who are you, Jack?

404
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,154
I can't get into it right now.

405
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,958
Yeah, well maybe you can get into this.

406
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,554
We found your print
at your ex-wife's house.

407
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,158
She was my ex-wife.
I pick up my kids there all the time.

408
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,878
The print's on the body.

409
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,509
Planted.

410
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,069
And there's a puff of smoke
comin' from the grassy knoll.

411
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,720
What kind of bullshit
you tryin' to run, man?

412
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:56,116
I ain't always been a cop.
That's all I can tell you right now.

413
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,234
You are one mysterious motherfucker.

414
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,675
Nobody seems to know anything
about your past...

415
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,638
...and the only evidence I got
points right at you.

416
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,995
Now, does that worry you, Jack?

417
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,679
Do I look worried?

418
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,991
Well, it damn sure worries me.

419
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,553
Hello, Lento's.

420
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,951
No, I'm sorry, we're closed.

421
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,555
- No. It's a private lunch.
- Excuse me.

422
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,398
There is nothing I can do.

423
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,554
I'm telling you we're closed today.
Tomorrow we'll be open.

424
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,631
It'll be fine. Come then. It'll be a nice...

425
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,153
Excuse me a minute.

426
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,920
Asshole, what are you blind?
We're closed!

427
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,036
You kind of talk too much!

428
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,718
Yeah, go ahead, come on over,
we'll give you a table.

429
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,713
You're unbelievable.
What are you doing here?

430
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:23,190
You need to turn around and leave.
That's what you need to do.

431
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:33,070
You don't call, you don't write.
What's worse, you don't take my calls.

432
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,913
Excuse me. Excuse me, sir... Senator...

433
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,550
Why don't you and I take your
little sensitive ponytail...

434
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:44,791
...and your little sissy beads,
and get out of here, okay?

435
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,913
As I was saying...

436
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:55,356
Senator, as you can see,
some urgent business has just come up.

437
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,071
Thank you, Senator, so kind.

438
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,918
It's been such a long time, Jack.
That's the name you're using now, correct?

439
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,194
At the moment.

440
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,078
Can I get you a bite to eat?
The food is truly wonderful...

441
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,116
...although the service leaves a little
to be desired.

442
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,590
Cut the shit. I need some names,
names of consultants.

443
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,550
Don't tell me there's a problem
you can't take care of yourself?

444
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,673
It's about the serial killings.
I know you know about them.

445
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:27,752
Yes, I do. Truly wicked. Sorry about Ellen.

446
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,159
Wonderful woman.

447
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:35,957
You know, the last two murders
were definitely the work of a pro...

448
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,871
...not a serial killer.

449
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:41,510
And I just have the feeling
that you might know who this pro is.

450
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,198
Well, let me guess.

451
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,237
They've discovered your checkered past...

452
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,470
...and now they suspect you.

453
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,473
Not exactly.

454
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:55,599
They're still not totally up on my past yet,
but I know you are.

455
00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:00,071
Therefore, I'm sure you realize
what I'm capable of doing to you...

456
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,559
...if I have to.

457
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,832
Yes, indeed, I do.

458
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,956
What kind of consultant you lookin' for?

459
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:10,669
This individual gives me the impression
that he's a freelancer.

460
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,838
Hiding his targets in the scenario
of a serial killer.

461
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,115
Likes a.22, likes head shots.

462
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:20,310
Seems to be inflicting costume wounds
on the victims after they're dead...

463
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,709
...and has excellent cleaning skills.

464
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,680
I'll certainly keep my eyes peeled,
and my ears open.

465
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,479
Right now, that's just not
gonna be good enough.

466
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:31,832
Jack, you know there's a problem.
I'm kind of busy right now...

467
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,592
...testifying before Congress.

468
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:37,832
They're getting kind of cranky
about where we get our core-op funds...

469
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,072
...but, as it's you...

470
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,670
...l'll certainly do the best I can.

471
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,559
For old times' sake.

472
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,038
Good to see you, buddy.

473
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,595
Bye, buddy.

474
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,677
If you ever pull that shit with me again,
I'll kill you.

475
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:05,753
All your little Chinese, moo-shoo pork
potions will not save you next time.

476
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,470
You shouldn't knock Chinese potions.

477
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,471
I have something in my pocket right now...

478
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,313
...that'll completely clear up that bruise
on your forehead.

479
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,389
What bruise?

480
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,629
That bruise.

481
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,958
Do you validate parking?

482
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,388
Hello, Lento's.

483
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,152
No, no, no, that' won't work.
We're closed for renovation. I'd say...

484
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,230
...two months. Yeah. Thanks.

485
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,952
You're chasing your tail with this one.

486
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:45,079
He probably bought it at a flea market.
No way we're gonna find him there.

487
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:49,593
We're gonna have to go back to basics.
You guys gotta do your canvassing.

488
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,153
- Your phone is ringing.
- You're not listening to me.

489
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,310
Read my lips... talk to the people!

490
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,594
<i>Detective, my name is Melanie Sardes.</i>

491
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:04,279
<i>I think I know who you're looking for.</i>

492
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:10,308
I'm sorry I didn't call you guys sooner,
Detective, but I don't open...

493
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:14,519
...my mail every day. There's so much,
it kind of gets away from me.

494
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:18,871
I used to teach art two days a week
up at the prison.

495
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,274
Do you have a cold?

496
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,078
No, I'm allergic to the incense.

497
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,752
Can I get you something?

498
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:30,594
No, thanks. I'm gonna go suck
on some deer penis. I'll be all right.

499
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,796
It's a Chinese deer penis.

500
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,958
You put it under your...

501
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,033
You were saying?

502
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:42,353
Well, I knew the drawings
you sent were familiar.

503
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,837
Especially the halos.

504
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,271
Then when I saw the titian crucifixion...

505
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,793
...it just clicked.

506
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,558
He was my favorite student.

507
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,876
See, my whole approach is organic.

508
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,393
I start on the inside influence...

509
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:58,756
...and then I try to draw
on the student's inner life.

510
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,629
It's about having them find the moment.
A moment without...

511
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,796
I've got to hurry back to the nineties now.

512
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,871
Could you just give me his name?

513
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,359
Christopher Maynard.

514
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,913
- We're moving fast on this.
- I know.

515
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,433
Where's our warrant?

516
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,431
Wait, give me a minute.

517
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,832
What's goin' on?

518
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,993
- You didn't hear?
- No, I didn't.

519
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,798
We got a make on the killer.
Name and address.

520
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,598
We're just waitin' for the warrants.

521
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,193
Thank you so much for tellin' me.

522
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,350
Well, I figured Campbell told you.

523
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,833
Yes, get me Research.

524
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,436
Would you do me a favor
and check if there's...

525
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:42,752
...a Catholic Church within a nine-block
radius of 929 Barrow Street?

526
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,716
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

527
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,034
I had this feeling I was gonna die today!

528
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,388
Christopher.

529
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,591
This isn't gonna work, buddy.
Here in a church...

530
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,833
...with the priest?

531
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,350
I don't want to be hurting people.

532
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,159
I don't like to.

533
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,354
Could I please speak with the priest?

534
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:29,148
Could I have your permission
to please speak with the Father a minute?

535
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,596
I know you don't want to hurt him.

536
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:32,715
Father...

537
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,433
...come here, please.

538
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,195
Right away.

539
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,519
Get out of here.

540
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,992
Are they searching for me?

541
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,513
Yes, sir, they are.

542
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,757
How did you know I'd be here?

543
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:04,878
Well, I just took a lucky guess.
It's the closest church to your home.

544
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:08,188
You're the new cop they brought in, right?

545
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,510
Yes, sir, I am. How'd you know?

546
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,718
I keep track of these things.
It's part of my job.

547
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,074
So, you know...

548
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,470
...you killed my ex-wife, don't you?

549
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,390
I want you to know I didn't hurt her.

550
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:30,836
You didn't?

551
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:33,992
I only kill who I was told to kill,
who I had to kill.

552
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,719
The Roslovs?

553
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,554
The Dunleavys?

554
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,159
Did you kill them?

555
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,959
I was spared them.

556
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,238
Someone else was called.

557
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,470
Who was given the call, Christopher?

558
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,116
There's too much pain here.
I gotta go now.

559
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,235
Listen to me.

560
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,309
You, stay!

561
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,594
Listen to me.

562
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,593
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
My last confession...

563
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:59,399
...was six months ago.
- Christopher, please...

564
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,474
Then you help me.

565
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,437
- You help me.
- I can't do that.

566
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,750
I am in hell! I am in hell!

567
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,198
Listen to me. Listen to me.

568
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:11,272
Do it now or I will kill you! You believe it?

569
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,750
- One... two...
- This is God's house.

570
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,796
- Don't make me do this.
- Please.

571
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,399
- Don't!
- Three!

572
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,789
This is Maynard's gun. Book it for me.

573
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:47,028
This is bad, Jack. This is real bad, man.

574
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,071
I can't win for losin', man.

575
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:53,353
I tried so hard not to let this happen.

576
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:57,793
We tossed his house, we found all kinds
of shit: Barbed wire, spikes...

577
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:00,110
- He was definitely our guy.
- Shit.

578
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,197
What the fuck are you doin' here?

579
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,113
Well, I just thought
that he wouldn't be home...

580
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,350
...maybe I'd find him at the church.

581
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,759
So, you came to blow him away?

582
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:15,196
No sir, he drew on me, tried to kill me.
I had no choice.

583
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:20,033
No choice? The priest told me
you let him go. Said he was calm.

584
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,631
We'll never know, will we?

585
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,356
It's just like DeMarco in New York.

586
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:29,478
You come out alone... the suspect is dead.

587
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,836
Captain, we had a positive ID on...

588
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,273
Shut the fuck up!

589
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:36,188
I don't want freelance cops working
for me!

590
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,231
I want you... and you...

591
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,191
...lnternal Affairs, tomorrow morning.

592
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,474
Don't be late.

593
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:56,514
Not so fast. We're sendin' for the poly.

594
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,038
So, what'd you tell him?

595
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:07,235
Everything. The prints, the bullshit past,
the whole nine.

596
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,675
You didn't leave me any choice, Jack.

597
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:13,149
Hey, that's what friends are for, right?

598
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:17,390
I'll start by asking you
a few test questions...

599
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:21,268
...just to establish a base line.
Please answer yes to both questions.

600
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,470
- Are you Detective Jack Cole?
- Yes.

601
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,869
- Have you ever climbed Mt. Everest?
- Yes.

602
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,073
Okay. Let's begin.

603
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,950
You've been a police officer
for seven years?

604
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:39,631
Yes.

605
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:42,712
Do you know how your fingerprints
came to be at the crime scene?

606
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:43,391
No.

607
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:46,119
Are you withholding information
pertinent to this investigation?

608
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:46,791
No.

609
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:49,269
Did you shoot Christopher Maynard?

610
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:50,349
Yes.

611
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,797
- Was it in self-defense?
- Yes.

612
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,831
Did you kill your ex-wife?

613
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:56,357
No.

614
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:58,510
- Have you ever killed anyone?
- Yes.

615
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:01,879
Have you ever killed anyone
outside of police duty?

616
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:04,918
I don't think that's pertinent
to this investigation.

617
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,399
It's a yes or no answer.

618
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,469
Is it?

619
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:10,159
There's my answer.

620
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,789
Don't do yourself any favors, Jack.

621
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:20,677
I've never seen anything like this.
Everything reads true.

622
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,798
Can someone learn to beat this thing?

623
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:29,714
It's possible, but you'd have to have
total control over your emotions.

624
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:32,798
I don't know anybody
who could pull that off.

625
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:35,711
What do you want me to do, Jack?

626
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:38,234
The prints' thing is bad enough,
but jerkin' the poly off...

627
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:41,198
...just leaves us with our dicks
in the air for all your fans.

628
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:44,317
You gotta tell me which fans
you're talkin' about. I have so many.

629
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,197
I'm talkin' about Frank Deverell.

630
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:47,952
He's talkin' to people about you.

631
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:48,950
Like who?

632
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,189
Like the DA.

633
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,072
You never should've been on the scene
with his kid.

634
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,037
About how you put him through a window.

635
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:56,270
I wonder if that's
the same Frank Deverell...

636
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,839
...that came and thanked me...

637
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,115
...for not shooting his son
in the goddamn head.

638
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:01,633
Yeah, things change.

639
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:04,031
Internal Affairs is lookin' at you, Jack...

640
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:06,509
...which means they're lookin' at me, too.

641
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:09,592
I'm gonna suspend you
until we can sort this shit out.

642
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:14,116
You know, I somehow think
that you know I'm gettin' screwed.

643
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,789
Yeah, well, tell it to the worry beads.

644
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,355
No one's takin' any chances with you, Jack.

645
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:22,989
You're officially a suspect in the murder
of your ex-wife and her husband.

646
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:26,231
Give me your ID, your badge
and make sure we know where you are...

647
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:28,276
...'cause IA is comin' for you.

648
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,549
Which one of these did you just piss in?

649
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:41,675
Son of a bitch.

650
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:55,311
Capt., you wanted to see me?

651
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:59,310
Christopher Maynard was with his church
group in New York for two weeks.

652
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:00,913
Keep me posted.

653
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:06,153
Accounted for every minute. There's
no way he could've done the last two.

654
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:08,356
Cole?

655
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:11,990
You tell me. He was havin'
a custody battle with his ex-wife.

656
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:15,631
She didn't want him spendin'
too much time with the kids.

657
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:17,917
Listen. When he was in New York...

658
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,470
...the DeMarco killings started two months
after he got assigned to Homicide.

659
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:22,993
He moved here eight months ago.

660
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:26,834
Exactly two months after that
The Family Man killings start.

661
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:30,396
Maybe we should see what he has to say.

662
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,436
What, are you goin' soft on me, Jim?

663
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:34,556
Guy's a weirdo, you said so yourself.

664
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:38,872
Just let Internal Affairs handle it.
They're puttin' a case together right now.

665
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,468
Stay away from him. He's bad news.

666
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:34,717
I take it something is amiss.

667
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:37,714
What was he doing there?

668
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,950
Didn't look like he was
after anything specific.

669
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:41,951
Nothing to worry about.

670
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:47,193
Got halfway through the place. Nothing
there to connect you to the Roslov woman.

671
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:49,316
I hope not, for your sake.

672
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:52,236
You should've gone through
that house days ago.

673
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:54,550
I'm not supposed to be doing cleanup.

674
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:06,239
<i>Where is she? Have you seen her?</i>

675
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:08,959
<i>No, I can't find her.</i>
<i>She checked out of the hotel.</i>

676
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:11,349
<i>But this note came just after you left.</i>

677
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,876
"I cannot go with you...

678
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,392
"...or ever see you again.

679
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:27,470
- "I love you... my darling."
- <i>That's the last call, Mr. Richard.</i>

680
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:29,472
"God bless you."

681
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:34,717
- What's happenin'?
- What's up?

682
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:38,074
- What the hell you doin' here?
- Gotta talk.

683
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:41,634
- Those aren't tears, are they?
- No, man.

684
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,356
My eyes leak sometimes when I yawn,
that's all.

685
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:47,793
- They leak?
- Yeah.

686
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:50,398
- They leak.
- What do you want?

687
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,755
- Let me just...
- Wait... l'm fine.

688
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:54,393
What do you want?

689
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:57,314
- I gotta talk to you.
- All right, come on.

690
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,748
What if there's a serial killer out there...

691
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:05,355
...he's killin' families,
we nickname him "The Family Man."

692
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:08,195
But there's somebody else out there...

693
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:10,752
...who has somethin' more sinister
goin' on.

694
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:13,115
He has to terminate some targets.

695
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:16,636
So, he kills his targets and
their entire families to make himself...

696
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:18,597
...look like The Family Man.

697
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,711
While we're lookin' for a serial killer.

698
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:23,917
When, in fact, there's two of 'em
and one of 'em is a pro.

699
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,390
- How do you know it's a pro?
- 'Cause I know the work of a pro.

700
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,390
I found this in Sonya Roslov's house.

701
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,392
It's a round trip to Moscow...

702
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:34,471
...bought and paid for
by Deverell Industries.

703
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:36,790
You think Frank Deverell
had somethin' to do with this?

704
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:37,949
I do, sir.

705
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:41,875
Sonya Roslov, she was a translator.

706
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:43,916
If Deverell did any business in Russia...

707
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,991
...it makes sense he'd hire someone
like that.

708
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:48,753
- What if she was a mule?
- Smuggling what?

709
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:51,510
Chemical weapons of some kind.

710
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:54,679
Now that the Wall fell...

711
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:57,035
...there's a ton of that stuff floatin' around.

712
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:59,588
That would explain the cancer in her body.

713
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:02,598
If you look at who controls that stuff
on the black market...

714
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:03,908
...it's the Russian Mafia.

715
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,468
- As in the guys who jumped us.
- You got it.

716
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:09,068
So, what connects the Dunleavys
to Deverell?

717
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:11,958
I don't know yet, but I know
we could find out.

718
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:16,030
You know, they will take my badge
if they find out I'm workin' with you.

719
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:18,873
But, my gut tells me you might be right.

720
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:22,676
- I always go with my gut.
- Okay.

721
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:29,115
I don't know about you, but I'm gonna
go see the rest of this movie.

722
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,633
Is it a good movie?

723
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:33,758
You've never seen <i>Casablanca</i>?

724
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:36,832
You're asking me
if I've ever seen <i>Casablanca</i>?

725
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:38,236
Have you?

726
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:40,959
You gotta be kidding. Me?
Never seen <i>Casablanca</i>?

727
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:42,439
Have you ever seen <i>Casablanca</i>?

728
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:43,316
No.

729
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:45,308
Come on.

730
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:51,232
And of course, Donald survived
with everything but his pride intact.

731
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:54,993
I never expected Cole to get this close.

732
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:59,031
I thought you kept better track
of your ex-employees.

733
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:03,273
No way to anticipate
he'd become this involved.

734
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:06,434
Who is he? Obviously not just a cop.

735
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:10,791
He was a brilliant soldier.
West Point, that kind of thing.

736
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:15,593
I found him in Vietnam.
Recruited him for a special projects unit.

737
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:18,717
The Program, we called it.

738
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:21,394
He handled a lot of odd jobs for us.

739
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:24,031
- Such as?
- Now, Mr. Deverell...

740
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:26,959
...don't ask about things
you don't really want to know.

741
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:29,759
Suffice to say, to the people he hunted
for us...

742
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:32,400
...he was known as "The Glimmer Man."

743
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:35,636
There'd be nothing but jungle...

744
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:38,033
...then a glimmer...

745
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:41,478
...then you'd be dead.

746
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:44,230
Why isn't he still with you?

747
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:48,155
He was booted out of the program in '84.
Went native on us.

748
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,831
Made up his own assignments.

749
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,911
Disappeared... for months.

750
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:56,191
Ended up in Thailand...

751
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:59,474
...chanting in some temple or other.

752
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:02,714
They say he was saved by a holy man.

753
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:08,199
So many stories about this fella,
I don't know which ones are true anymore.

754
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:16,156
- What do we do about him?
- Broom him.

755
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:19,758
Time to lose everybody
who knows anythin'.

756
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:23,677
And I mean everybody.

757
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:26,953
Johnny's no threat.

758
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:31,550
I beg to differ. He's already spilled
to the shrink.

759
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:36,118
The poor boy knows too much.
Simple as that.

760
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:39,038
Johnny'll do what I say.

761
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:41,270
Let me put this another way.

762
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:44,353
I have four loose links in this operation:

763
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,710
Two cops, you, and the boy.

764
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:49,358
Three of you have to go.

765
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:51,352
You can choose which three.

766
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:56,590
You'll have to do it yourself.

767
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:58,599
Frank, I'll take care of Johnny.

768
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:01,148
Who's gonna take care of Cole
and Campbell?

769
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:03,550
I'll put Donald on the others right away.

770
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:05,153
That's the spirit.

771
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:07,788
Now, come on in. The water's fine.

772
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:27,475
Shit!

773
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:17,631
Take the kids upstairs.

774
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:25,552
- John Cole?
- Yes.

775
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:28,075
Miller and Russo from Internal Affairs.

776
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:30,230
We have a warrant for your arrest.

777
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:33,279
Do you want to take a minute
to gather a few things?

778
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:36,079
No, that's perfectly all right.
I'm ready to go.

779
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:27,790
Coldest winter I can remember in LA.

780
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:29,959
Wettest, too.

781
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:28,073
They got you, too.

782
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:30,674
No, I bought all this shit after the riots.

783
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:33,195
It means we're close, man, we're close.

784
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:35,078
Do I look like I give a shit?

785
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:39,199
You better give a shit, 'cause they ain't
gonna stop till they get us both.

786
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:45,271
Does this say, "deer antler"?

787
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:47,753
Give me that.

788
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:51,997
- It was a free sample.
- There's a whole case over here.

789
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:53,991
Just stay out of my shit.

790
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:58,029
Can I just take this moment to tell you
how moved I am deeply?

791
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:00,270
Yeah, well, that makes one of us.

792
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:03,554
I found somethin'
on your ex-wife's phone records.

793
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:05,870
Someone called the house the night
she was killed.

794
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:10,112
They called six times, only talked about 10
or 15 seconds each time.

795
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:12,591
You got a number or somethin'?

796
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:16,949
Could I take those CDs?
They look like I could still use them.

797
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:19,279
Got it. Come on.

798
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:22,398
Could I ask you somethin'?
Did you actually live in this shitbox?

799
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:24,038
Man, will you come on?

800
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:46,435
Now, what if this is really our guy?

801
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:48,511
- We'll reason with him.
- Right.

802
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:53,434
- What?
- Police!

803
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:57,878
I'm Detective Cole,
this is Detective Campbell...

804
01:02:57,960 --> 01:03:00,428
...with the Los Angeles Police Department.

805
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:02,750
We'd like to ask you some questions
about some calls...

806
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:05,149
...you may have made to a Dr. Dunleavy.

807
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:10,949
You look like you just came from a riot.

808
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:11,950
Thanks.

809
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:14,395
He looks like he just came from a riot.

810
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:18,190
Yeah, this number's billed to me,
but it's my daughter's phone.

811
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:23,472
I know you, don't I?

812
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:27,591
Yeah, you know me. You put my boyfriend
through a window.

813
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:32,074
High school, window. I remember now.

814
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:35,194
You're Johnny Deverell's girlfriend,
aren't you?

815
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:35,996
So?

816
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:39,993
So, I was just wondering, how long
have you known Dr. Dunleavy?

817
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:43,276
I don't know any Dunleavy.

818
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,673
You called him the night he was killed.

819
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:50,113
Yeah. Well, it wasn't me.
I don't need a shrink.

820
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:52,951
We never said he was a shrink.

821
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,673
Okay, I knew him but I didn't call him.

822
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:00,873
I wonder who did?

823
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:03,475
Johnny did.

824
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:06,918
When he got busted with the coke,
they made him see a shrink.

825
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,956
The shrink was Dunleavy, right?

826
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:10,235
Millie.

827
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:13,950
Let me tell you something, sweetheart,
the games are over.

828
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:16,475
I want you to tell me right now...

829
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:19,792
...why Johnny was making phone calls
from this room.

830
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:21,952
He was afraid to call from home.

831
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:23,029
Why?

832
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:26,715
His stepfather. Johnny knew
some bad things he was doing.

833
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:29,918
Would you happen to know
where we could find this boy?

834
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,197
His stepfather put him away
at Our Lady Of Angels.

835
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:38,110
You don't think Deverell would kill
his own stepson, do you?

836
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:42,398
Right. Dumb question.
Let's get out of here.

837
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:40,154
- You all right, Johnny?
- Yeah, never been better.

838
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:42,879
Yeah, we need to ask some questions
about your stepdad.

839
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:44,279
He's a prick.

840
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:46,792
Yeah, besides that.

841
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:50,077
Did your dad kill Dunleavy?

842
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:54,357
Yeah, I tried to call him,
I tried to warn him, I swear to God.

843
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:56,510
We know, we know. It's all right.

844
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:00,354
All right, everybody just relax. Police.

845
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:01,908
Why'd he do it?

846
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:04,913
Okay, he had Donald kill his translator...

847
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:10,518
...because she knew that my father was
smugglin' in some bad shit from Russia.

848
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:13,191
And I found out about it.

849
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:16,836
So, he got all freaked out,
and thought I told Dr. Dunleavy.

850
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:19,914
So he had Donald kill him and his wife...

851
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,389
...and made it look
like the serial killer did it.

852
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:23,833
Who was helpin' him?

853
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:25,433
Some little guy.

854
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:28,193
Southern accent...

855
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:31,197
- Smith.
- Yeah, the government guy.

856
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:32,679
Who's Smith?

857
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:34,996
You're about to find out.

858
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:37,071
Sister, take this boy
and keep an eye on him.

859
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:39,355
Don't let anything happen to him.
Don't leave him alone.

860
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:42,398
Yes, of course.
I'll take care of you, Johnny. Come.

861
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:50,473
See you later, Joe.

862
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:15,754
How you doin'?

863
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:20,070
Jack, what a pleasant surprise...

864
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:27,593
You know, in most states in this country...

865
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:31,315
...kidnapping is still a no-no.
Hell, we don't even do it anymore.

866
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:33,789
Do me a favor. Spare me the drama and...

867
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:36,554
...tell me a story.
What's Deverell smuggling?

868
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:39,357
I have no idea what you're talking about.

869
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:40,350
Really?

870
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:44,829
Goddamn, Jack! What are you doin', man?

871
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:49,992
Deverell's killed four people to hide
something, and I want to find out what.

872
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:52,196
You're a fuckin' psycho.

873
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:55,589
I don't know what the hell
he's talkin' about.

874
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:56,908
Well, you're a cop!

875
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,558
Aren't you gonna help?

876
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,315
Okay.

877
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:02,876
But I'm a really bad shot.

878
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:05,508
- Stay out of it.
- I'm just tryin' to help.

879
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:08,436
Kill me if you like, you son of a bitch.

880
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:11,159
I still have no idea
what you're talkin' about.

881
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:15,677
Jack, I know we've had some harsh words
in the past...

882
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:26,554
- I tell you I do not know...
- Okay...

883
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:34,788
I need that hand. Jack, I need that hand.

884
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:37,589
You know I will. Right about...

885
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:40,155
All right! Time! Game over!

886
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:56,037
God I miss you, Jack.

887
01:08:57,840 --> 01:09:00,991
So many young men today
just won't go that extra mile.

888
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,753
I miss you too, Smith. Now, what is it?

889
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:06,953
Deverell is smugglin'...

890
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:08,792
...chemical weapons in from Russia.

891
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:13,032
I made the contacts for him. The deal's
being brokered by the Russian Mafia.

892
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:17,591
Would one of you gentlemen mind
callin' me an ambulance?

893
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:19,830
So, what's he doin' with this stuff?

894
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:23,230
Deal's bein' done tomorrow.
Some welfare hotel downtown.

895
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:26,279
He's sellin' it to a bunch
of Serbian freedom fighters.

896
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:27,839
You mean terrorists.

897
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:30,310
Semantics. You say tomato...

898
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:33,878
No, motherfucker, I didn't say, "tomato."
I said, "terrorists."

899
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:35,109
You work for the government.

900
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:37,714
Why would you, of all people,
help Deverell?

901
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:42,838
To get rich, son. To get rich, why else?

902
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:44,628
You got that?

903
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:46,918
Yeah, I got that.

904
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:52,394
Well, aren't you the grown-up spy?

905
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:56,152
What do you want?

906
01:09:56,520 --> 01:10:00,115
I want you and your friends
to leave me alone. Forget that I exist.

907
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:01,315
I already have.

908
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:02,879
Don't make me come back and kill you.

909
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:04,234
- I won't.
- Good.

910
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:13,637
Gentlemen, we must not forget
the little matter...

911
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:17,274
...of the ambulance.
- I only shot you in one foot.

912
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:19,157
Hobble to a hospital.

913
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:35,159
<i>Well, safe to assume, folks,</i>
<i>that the rainiest winter in memory is over.</i>

914
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:39,518
<i>Sunny and dry weather for tomorrow</i>
<i>and for the entire five-day period.</i>

915
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:43,030
<i>Everything we could hope for</i>
<i>in this part of the country...</i>

916
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:47,037
<i>Deverell is smugglin' chemical weapons in</i>
<i>from Russia.</i>

917
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:50,188
<i>The deal's bein' brokered</i>
<i>by the Russian Mafia.</i>

918
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:52,350
- Who is this?
- <i>So, how's that, asshole?</i>

919
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:55,477
I know you're friends with everyone
from the postman to the President...

920
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:57,915
...but no one will touch you
with a ten-foot pole...

921
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,592
...when this shit gets out. Understand?

922
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:01,193
Detective Cole.

923
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:04,360
You are persistent, I'll give you that.

924
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:07,352
Looks like I got somethin' you want,
you got somethin' I want.

925
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:09,590
- What might that be?
- <i>Donald.</i>

926
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:11,951
Donald's your triggerman, isn't he?

927
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:12,950
I'm listening.

928
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:14,792
<i>I want him, not you.</i>

929
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:17,599
<i>Deliver him to me with a nice bow</i>
<i>and the murder weapon.</i>

930
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:19,318
<i>I'll take it from there.</i>

931
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:23,313
You take the tape... my name
gets clean... your name stays clean.

932
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:25,711
<i>Everybody's happy, how's that?</i>

933
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:26,915
Done.

934
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,672
Why don't you meet me tomorrow?

935
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:33,196
I'm doing a little business at a place
called the Ovington Arms, downtown.

936
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:36,158
Apartment D-14.
Would 10:00 be good for you?

937
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:44,591
Why does this gotta be so complicated?

938
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:46,716
This isn't complicated.
It's nothing but a game.

939
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:48,756
Reminds me of an old Persian tactician...

940
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:51,673
...trying to teach his young troops strategy.

941
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:53,990
That, later on, came to be known as chess.

942
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:55,798
So, we're gonna bore 'em to death now?

943
01:11:55,880 --> 01:11:58,838
Young warriors used to like
to fight head-on.

944
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:01,350
Old warriors like to wait...

945
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:05,679
...let their opponents expose the board,
work themselves into a corner...

946
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:08,149
Time to go. Sun Tzu, <i>The Art of War</i>.

947
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:11,359
Sun Tzu. Just keeps gettin' stranger.

948
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:17,753
<i>Donald's your triggerman, isn't he?</i>

949
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:18,716
<i>I'm listening.</i>

950
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:20,358
<i>I want him, not you.</i>

951
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:23,273
<i>Deliver him to me with a nice bow</i>
<i>and the murder weapon.</i>

952
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:24,713
<i>I'll take it from there.</i>

953
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:27,394
<i>Take the tape... my name gets clean...</i>

954
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:31,390
<i>... your name stays clean.</i>
<i>Everybody's happy, how's that?</i>

955
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:33,036
<i>Done.</i>

956
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:37,872
Guess your ass just got sold
down the river, shithead.

957
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,275
This won't take long. Just a quick pick up.

958
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:09,759
I'm sure it won't.

959
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:15,713
Shabby, but chic.

960
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:26,831
Either we're a little early...

961
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:29,036
...or our hosts are a little late.

962
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:38,510
What the hell is going on, Donald?

963
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:40,549
You tell me.

964
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:47,033
You think you're gonna hand me over
to Cole. Bad move, fruitcake.

965
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:50,629
I don't know what you're talking about.

966
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:55,833
You'll never get out of here.

967
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:57,911
No, this is my show from now on.

968
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:07,431
Positively Shakespearean.

969
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:09,629
"To be...

970
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:11,116
"...or not to be!"

971
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:12,396
Time to go.

972
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:15,233
Wait. We don't know how many guys are
in there.

973
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:18,471
What do you want me to do?
Wait till they all kill each other?

974
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:20,357
If the old warriors are patient and...

975
01:15:20,440 --> 01:15:22,635
...all the young warriors,
they kill each other and...

976
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:24,073
...that's how we get to be old.

977
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:25,798
I like that plan too. You listened well.

978
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:27,552
That's what I told you in the bar.

979
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:29,915
I don't know why I don't listen to myself.
I'm stupid.

980
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,319
Let's just wait.

981
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:34,038
Drop the guns! Police!

982
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:36,390
Put your guns down!

983
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:37,708
Drop that fuckin' gun!

984
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:38,869
Drop the gun now!

985
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:40,359
Drop the gun, boy.

986
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:06,955
Freeze!

987
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:12,319
Just drop it!

988
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:13,794
You, too!

989
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:15,516
Where do you live?

990
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:18,717
- Around the corner.
- Well, get your ass around the corner!

991
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:21,234
And take little Whoopi Goldberg with you.

992
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,194
Jesus Christ.

993
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:25,398
Showdown on Sesame Street.

994
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:28,833
Big Bird will pop out of one
of these doors next.

995
01:18:18,240 --> 01:18:19,036
Hi!

996
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:31,275
Out here!

997
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:36,878
Hurry, man! I can't hold on much longer!

998
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:41,794
Oh, God, don't look down.
Don't look down.

999
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:44,759
Oh, don't look up.

1000
01:18:56,160 --> 01:18:57,673
All right, hang on.

1001
01:18:57,840 --> 01:18:59,671
Yeah. That's a good idea, man.

1002
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:01,751
I wouldn't have thought of that.

1003
01:19:04,360 --> 01:19:06,476
- All right, are you ready?
- Ready for what?

1004
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:07,595
For this.

1005
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:10,709
There's a window, Jack!
There's a window!

1006
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:15,588
Is that your gun
or are you gettin' excited, man?

1007
01:19:15,680 --> 01:19:17,159
Get off me. Get off.

1008
01:19:18,280 --> 01:19:20,840
Police business. We're right on
out of here.

1009
01:19:23,480 --> 01:19:27,155
- Can you make it down to the lobby?
- Yeah, I'll be all right.

1010
01:19:28,160 --> 01:19:29,957
The elevator was broken.

1011
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:10,353
Has anybody ever told you
you're a real pain in the ass?

1012
01:20:10,440 --> 01:20:11,634
All the time.

1013
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:17,634
You're not gonna have to hear it anymore.

1014
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:22,270
I'm gonna take care of you
like I took care of your ex-wife.

1015
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:48,913
Here we are.

1016
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:53,359
When you wake up in the morning
and look in the mirror...

1017
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:55,749
...I think you're probably happy...

1018
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:59,071
...pleased at what you see.
And that disturbs me.

1019
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:03,280
So, I'm gonna take it on
as my responsibility...

1020
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:06,796
...to make sure that you never get to look
in the mirror again.

1021
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:10,748
I woke up happy, I'm going to bed happy
'cause you're gonna be dead.

1022
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:53,599
Take your best shot.

1023
01:21:56,040 --> 01:21:57,678
No, I said, "Best shot."

1024
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:00,510
Boring.

1025
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:13,791
Is that the best you got, boy?

1026
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:19,270
If that's the best you got,
I'm just gonna have to kill you.

1027
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:24,359
Is that all you got?

1028
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:45,432
You don't look like you're gonna be
wakin' up happy now.

1029
01:23:25,080 --> 01:23:26,115
Hey, Capt.

1030
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:28,191
You're looking a little rough there,
Campbell.

1031
01:23:28,280 --> 01:23:30,589
Yeah, well, they say I'm gonna make it.

1032
01:23:31,160 --> 01:23:32,832
Guess I owe you an apology, Jack.

1033
01:23:32,920 --> 01:23:34,638
God, wouldn't that be nice?

1034
01:23:35,480 --> 01:23:37,391
Well, you're not gonna get it.

1035
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:40,278
But I do owe it to you.

1036
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:43,675
Do me a favor,
tell my wife I'm alive and well.

1037
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:45,079
You got it.

1038
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:46,275
Feel better, kid.

1039
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:47,236
Yeah.

1040
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:52,870
Say, Jack. How about we not talk
for a couple of days?

1041
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:55,113
Somethin' I said?

1042
01:23:55,240 --> 01:23:58,516
It's just that ever since
you started bein' my partner...

1043
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:01,509
...l've been beat up, blown up...

1044
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:04,916
...shot, kicked out a window...

1045
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,833
...all my worldly possessions
burnt to a crisp.

1046
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:11,157
Basically, I'm homeless.

1047
01:24:12,240 --> 01:24:14,390
Not one good thing has happened
since I met you.

1048
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:15,993
You got to try powdered deer penis.

1049
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:17,433
That should count for something.

1050
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:20,353
Don't call me, Jack.
Don't leave me a message.

1051
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:24,433
Don't fax me. If I see a bird on my window
with a message on its foot...

1052
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:26,431
...l'm throwin' him back out.

1053
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:27,270
Don't send flowers.

1054
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:30,592
Forget you know me, Jack!

1055
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:29,589
