1
00:01:18,777 --> 00:01:19,766
I got to go. Sorry.

2
00:01:19,878 --> 00:01:21,402
Are you okay?

3
00:01:21,513 --> 00:01:23,674
Thank you. Lights.

4
00:01:23,782 --> 00:01:25,477
Manadoro, where are you going?

5
00:01:25,583 --> 00:01:27,744
Are my critiques so terrifying?

6
00:01:27,852 --> 00:01:29,183
I'm sorry. It's an emergency.

7
00:01:57,349 --> 00:01:58,782
Joey.

8
00:01:58,883 --> 00:02:00,373
Go round to 14th.

9
00:02:00,485 --> 00:02:02,612
Keep your eyes open.

10
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:15,632
Nicky?

11
00:02:15,734 --> 00:02:16,723
Nicky?

12
00:02:16,835 --> 00:02:18,427
Get over here. Don't go anywhere.

13
00:02:18,536 --> 00:02:19,525
Where are you going?

14
00:02:19,637 --> 00:02:20,968
Stay over here. Stay here.

15
00:02:21,072 --> 00:02:22,596
What the fuck's he gonna
do to him, Lou?

16
00:02:25,043 --> 00:02:26,704
Lou, you can stop this thing.

17
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,413
Jesus Christ!

18
00:02:30,515 --> 00:02:31,607
Nick.

19
00:02:31,716 --> 00:02:33,149
Nicky.

20
00:03:08,019 --> 00:03:10,385
Nicky Shades was the best
sewer-to-sewer football player ...

21
00:03:10,488 --> 00:03:14,447
I ever saw.

22
00:03:14,559 --> 00:03:17,084
Everyone thought he was gonna be
a big star in college ...

23
00:03:17,195 --> 00:03:18,184
and then go pro.

24
00:03:18,296 --> 00:03:19,285
Yeah!

25
00:03:20,832 --> 00:03:24,233
But after 9/11, he enlisted
and went to Afghanistan.

26
00:03:24,335 --> 00:03:27,600
I didn't have the balls
to do anything like that.

27
00:03:27,705 --> 00:03:29,639
The furthest I'd ever been
from the neighborhood ...

28
00:03:29,741 --> 00:03:32,005
was the Jersey shore,
when my mother got sick.

29
00:03:35,747 --> 00:03:38,238
But I'd always wanted
to do something brave ...

30
00:03:38,349 --> 00:03:39,782
like Nicky.

31
00:03:41,352 --> 00:03:43,286
In a way,
that's how this all got started.

32
00:03:47,325 --> 00:03:49,555
I don't understand.

33
00:03:49,661 --> 00:03:51,595
Why are you not registered yet?

34
00:03:51,696 --> 00:03:53,926
You see, they only gave me
a partial scholarship,

35
00:03:54,032 --> 00:03:55,329
just a partial one,

36
00:03:55,433 --> 00:03:57,765
and they need me to take
a full group of courses,

37
00:03:57,869 --> 00:03:59,200
which I can't afford
the full group.

38
00:03:59,304 --> 00:04:01,499
Well, based on
your father's income,

39
00:04:01,606 --> 00:04:04,200
you should qualify for loans.

40
00:04:04,309 --> 00:04:05,298
A loan?

41
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:07,207
When my father
got out of the service,

42
00:04:07,312 --> 00:04:08,711
he had a wife and two kids.

43
00:04:08,813 --> 00:04:09,802
Couldn't find a job.

44
00:04:09,914 --> 00:04:11,313
Didn't want to go on welfare ...

45
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:12,849
because he didn't believe
in charity.

46
00:04:12,951 --> 00:04:14,350
He shined shoes.

47
00:04:14,452 --> 00:04:16,750
Six days a week,
ten hours a day.

48
00:04:16,855 --> 00:04:19,949
He told me,
if any of the kids asked,

49
00:04:20,058 --> 00:04:21,286
that he worked on Wall Street.

50
00:04:21,392 --> 00:04:22,757
Which technically he did.

51
00:04:22,861 --> 00:04:24,886
Well, that's very admirable.

52
00:04:24,996 --> 00:04:26,725
But things have changed.

53
00:04:26,831 --> 00:04:30,289
Our government
owes trillions of dollars.

54
00:04:30,401 --> 00:04:32,562
Surely you can borrow
$30,000 or $40,000.

55
00:04:33,771 --> 00:04:35,864
Mike, let me tell you something.

56
00:04:35,974 --> 00:04:37,874
The only school worth that ...

57
00:04:37,976 --> 00:04:39,739
would teach you
how to print money.

58
00:04:39,844 --> 00:04:40,902
Your father's a funny man.

59
00:04:41,012 --> 00:04:42,877
He's joking
about counterfeiting.

60
00:04:42,981 --> 00:04:44,414
Look, if you could just
do me a favor ...

61
00:04:44,516 --> 00:04:45,949
and get me into
a photography workshop ...

62
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:47,074
with Professor Reyerson,

63
00:04:47,185 --> 00:04:49,210
if you could just get me
into that one class, one class,

64
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,117
this guy can teach me
everything I need to know,

65
00:04:51,222 --> 00:04:52,211
everything.

66
00:04:52,323 --> 00:04:54,188
It's like having an appetizer
at a really nice restaurant ...

67
00:04:54,292 --> 00:04:56,487
or eating a full meal
at a crappy drive-through place.

68
00:04:56,594 --> 00:04:58,459
You get what I'm saying?

69
00:04:58,563 --> 00:05:01,088
Besides, I always tip
really nice,

70
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,427
really, really nice.

71
00:05:02,534 --> 00:05:04,832
Let me give you a tip.

72
00:05:04,936 --> 00:05:07,905
This is a university,
not a Brooklyn trattoria.

73
00:05:08,006 --> 00:05:10,804
So you're just gonna
have to coax your father ...

74
00:05:10,909 --> 00:05:12,740
into the 21st century.

75
00:05:12,844 --> 00:05:13,833
Sorry.

76
00:05:13,945 --> 00:05:16,106
You're fuckin' sorry?

77
00:05:16,214 --> 00:05:17,408
Sorry, are you kidding me?
- Hey.

78
00:05:17,515 --> 00:05:19,574
You don't know my father;
you don't know me, you prick.

79
00:05:19,684 --> 00:05:21,117
Yeah, reach for the phone,
you dick.

I had this girl at my house,
you know?

85
00:06:07,298 --> 00:06:08,595
And I was like,
"Yo, you got to do your thing."

86
00:06:08,733 --> 00:06:10,257
And I was like,
"Bitch, you got to listen up."

87
00:06:11,936 --> 00:06:13,494
Hey, yo, Mikey, Mikey.

88
00:06:13,605 --> 00:06:15,038
Come on, baby,
time, baby, time.

89
00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:16,868
I got other jobs to do.

90
00:06:16,975 --> 00:06:19,136
I lived in Bay Ridge.

91
00:06:19,244 --> 00:06:20,939
Who would have thought
the ass end of Brooklyn ...

92
00:06:21,045 --> 00:06:22,808
would be the next
hot neighborhood?

93
00:06:22,914 --> 00:06:25,109
But some days,
it was hard to tell.

94
00:06:25,216 --> 00:06:27,047
My friends sure as shit
hadn't gotten the news.

95
00:06:27,151 --> 00:06:28,140
Hi, Joe.

96
00:06:28,253 --> 00:06:29,242
Oh, thanks.

97
00:06:29,354 --> 00:06:31,151
All right,
I'll talk to you later.

98
00:06:31,256 --> 00:06:32,985
So what happened?
A three-hour trip now?

99
00:06:33,091 --> 00:06:36,822
There's traffic.
What do you want me to do?

100
00:06:36,928 --> 00:06:38,156
Again with this fucking camera.

101
00:06:38,263 --> 00:06:40,959
Put the fucking camera down.

102
00:06:41,065 --> 00:06:42,054
This is a job here.

103
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:44,361
We're working, okay?

104
00:06:49,974 --> 00:06:53,034
Gina Abruzzi, my girlfriend.

105
00:06:53,144 --> 00:06:56,307
She said she'll quit smoking
the day I ask her to marry me.

106
00:06:56,414 --> 00:06:59,611
So on top of everything else,
I cause lung cancer.

107
00:07:19,604 --> 00:07:22,869
You should try actually
sleeping in the bed.

108
00:07:24,709 --> 00:07:26,574
Come on, we're late.

109
00:07:31,449 --> 00:07:34,145
All right, I will be out
in five minutes.

110
00:07:35,787 --> 00:07:37,914
If it ain't
Beau Brumbles himself.

111
00:07:40,224 --> 00:07:41,418
What's the con?

112
00:07:41,526 --> 00:07:43,289
Benefit the same
ignorant motherfuckers ...

113
00:07:43,394 --> 00:07:45,259
that you took money on
last week.

114
00:07:45,363 --> 00:07:48,025
♪ Won't you come around? ♪

115
00:07:48,132 --> 00:07:50,396
♪ Won't you come around? ♪

116
00:07:56,441 --> 00:07:58,909
Chuckie and my father used to
work together in sanitation.

117
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:01,308
Since his accident,
my father couldn't drive,

118
00:08:01,412 --> 00:08:03,573
do any heavy lifting.

119
00:08:03,681 --> 00:08:04,909
He was on
the disability pension,

120
00:08:05,016 --> 00:08:06,347
which he supplemented
quite nicely ...

121
00:08:06,451 --> 00:08:08,885
by taking action
in the neighborhood bars.

122
00:08:17,161 --> 00:08:19,721
I drove him on his rounds
every morning,

123
00:08:19,831 --> 00:08:21,628
and then he dropped off
his receipts with Tony.

124
00:08:21,733 --> 00:08:24,258
When I was young, I thought
Tony was king of the world.

125
00:08:24,369 --> 00:08:27,861
My father had to explain his
territory ended at 4th Avenue.

126
00:08:27,972 --> 00:08:28,961
Hey.

127
00:08:29,073 --> 00:08:32,008
Rumor had it the Albanian mob
was even encroaching on that.

128
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,941
Somebody had torched
one of Tony's social clubs,

129
00:08:34,045 --> 00:08:36,707
and so he was hanging around
his brother Lou's car service.

130
00:08:37,949 --> 00:08:39,280
Can I talk to you
about something?

131
00:08:39,384 --> 00:08:41,375
I told you, no loans.

132
00:08:41,486 --> 00:08:43,420
Come on,
give the fuckin' kid a tip.

133
00:08:43,521 --> 00:08:44,545
Don't be a cheap bastard.

134
00:08:44,655 --> 00:08:46,714
He drives you around
every fuckin' day.

135
00:08:46,824 --> 00:08:49,486
He won't take nothin'.

136
00:08:49,594 --> 00:08:51,653
Nothin'. No?

137
00:08:51,763 --> 00:08:53,628
You good people
like your old man?

138
00:08:55,233 --> 00:08:56,222
Come on, let's get a drink.

139
00:08:56,334 --> 00:08:57,392
I got so much stuff to —

140
00:08:57,502 --> 00:08:59,697
- Small drink, that big.
- All right.

141
00:08:59,804 --> 00:09:01,237
- Come on.
- Go.

142
00:09:01,339 --> 00:09:02,328
Every fuckin' time.

143
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,738
I worked in a typical
car service crew,

144
00:09:04,842 --> 00:09:07,140
evenly split between
the retired ...

145
00:09:07,245 --> 00:09:08,234
Danny, go, shoot.

146
00:09:08,346 --> 00:09:09,335
And the retarded.

147
00:09:09,447 --> 00:09:12,211
Any one,
just put one down, go.

148
00:09:12,316 --> 00:09:13,305
Cocksucker.

149
00:09:14,852 --> 00:09:16,752
- You said to throw.
- That's what you throw?

150
00:09:16,854 --> 00:09:17,843
This is what I get for playing ...

151
00:09:17,955 --> 00:09:19,388
with a goddamn
born-again Christian.

152
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:21,515
Wait, wait, so if he
don't gamble, you pay double?

153
00:09:21,626 --> 00:09:22,957
Yeah, and if we win,
I win double.

154
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,994
But so far, that's just
a beautiful fuckin' theory.

155
00:09:25,096 --> 00:09:26,222
You're not allowed
to drink neither.

156
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:27,661
It's a choice.

157
00:09:27,765 --> 00:09:29,027
He's allowed
to screw his wife,

158
00:09:29,133 --> 00:09:30,430
so long as he don't enjoy it.

159
00:09:32,103 --> 00:09:33,593
Car service.

160
00:09:33,704 --> 00:09:35,433
Come on.

161
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,632
It's Eileen Zaccaro.

162
00:09:36,741 --> 00:09:37,730
Who's up?
- I'm up.

163
00:09:37,842 --> 00:09:39,935
No, you're not up.
I'm up.

164
00:09:40,044 --> 00:09:41,875
For Eileen Zaccaro,
I'm way up.

165
00:09:41,979 --> 00:09:43,003
Eileen Zaccaro.

166
00:09:43,114 --> 00:09:44,103
Damn.

167
00:09:44,215 --> 00:09:47,776
She sucked and fucked
everything that moved,

168
00:09:47,885 --> 00:09:50,080
and everybody knew that
except for her husband,

169
00:09:50,188 --> 00:09:51,712
Phil Zaccaro.

170
00:09:51,823 --> 00:09:52,812
It's gonna be Danny.

171
00:09:52,924 --> 00:09:54,687
About five minutes, Eileen,
all right?

172
00:09:57,929 --> 00:09:59,260
Hey, Danny,
have her come in here.

173
00:09:59,363 --> 00:10:00,352
She could do all of us.

174
00:10:00,465 --> 00:10:01,454
Yeah, invite Philly Zac.

175
00:10:01,566 --> 00:10:02,726
He can come watch.

176
00:10:02,834 --> 00:10:03,994
You both make me sick.

177
00:10:04,101 --> 00:10:05,796
Oh, yeah, born again.

178
00:10:05,903 --> 00:10:07,598
Once was bad enough
with this fuckin' guy.

179
00:10:08,806 --> 00:10:11,297
You know, God danced
the day that you were born.

180
00:10:11,409 --> 00:10:13,673
But when you have a heart attack
in the Battery Tunnel,

181
00:10:13,778 --> 00:10:15,643
he's not gonna care that
you meant to straighten out.

182
00:10:15,746 --> 00:10:17,941
When you die,
all that matters ...

183
00:10:18,049 --> 00:10:20,643
is the state of grace
that you're in right then.

184
00:10:20,751 --> 00:10:22,742
When you die —
- When you die.

185
00:10:22,854 --> 00:10:25,914
When you die in Brooklyn,
God says, "Fuck you."

186
00:10:29,093 --> 00:10:30,082
Fuckin' idiot.

187
00:10:30,194 --> 00:10:31,320
Car service.

188
00:10:35,433 --> 00:10:37,094
Fuckin' Nicky Shades.

189
00:10:37,201 --> 00:10:39,567
And then Nicky Shades
rolled in.

190
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:41,661
First time I'd seen him
in eight years.

191
00:10:43,374 --> 00:10:45,865
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I need a job.

192
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,711
How's it going?

193
00:10:52,884 --> 00:10:53,873
I know the neighborhood.

194
00:10:55,453 --> 00:10:56,715
Yeah.

195
00:10:56,821 --> 00:10:58,118
In five minutes, hon.

196
00:10:58,222 --> 00:10:59,484
All right.

197
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:01,717
Hey Joey, you're up.

198
00:11:03,761 --> 00:11:07,754
You see, usually, I only
take guys with their own cars.

199
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,761
That's my car.

200
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:15,638
It's kind of old, no offense.

201
00:11:16,941 --> 00:11:18,636
Cheers.

202
00:11:18,743 --> 00:11:20,005
Wait a second.

203
00:11:20,111 --> 00:11:21,203
Lou.

204
00:11:21,312 --> 00:11:22,836
Just give this guy a break.

205
00:11:22,947 --> 00:11:25,142
If he breaks down, I look bad.

206
00:11:25,249 --> 00:11:26,238
And guess what.

207
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:27,374
This is my business.

208
00:11:27,485 --> 00:11:28,509
I understand that, Lou.

209
00:11:28,619 --> 00:11:31,986
Look, if he breaks down,
I'll give him my car.

210
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:33,979
He fought for our country.

211
00:11:34,091 --> 00:11:36,059
Hey, I fuckin' know that.

212
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,560
I don't hire war heroes.

213
00:11:38,663 --> 00:11:40,426
I need reliable drivers.

214
00:11:46,671 --> 00:11:48,036
Joey.

215
00:11:48,139 --> 00:11:49,299
The fuck are you doing?
Get going.

216
00:11:56,514 --> 00:11:58,744
All right, look,
if you vouch for him.

217
00:12:01,719 --> 00:12:02,708
I do.

218
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,185
I don't want to hear any shit ...

219
00:12:04,288 --> 00:12:05,983
if I call you at 2:00
in the fuckin' morning.

220
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:08,217
- You won't.
- It's gonna be your ass.

221
00:12:08,326 --> 00:12:09,350
I know.

222
00:12:11,128 --> 00:12:12,117
Give me your license.

223
00:12:14,932 --> 00:12:16,422
Thanks.

224
00:12:16,534 --> 00:12:17,796
Yeah, no problem.

225
00:12:19,804 --> 00:12:21,601
Car service.

226
00:12:21,706 --> 00:12:22,934
Michael, right?

227
00:12:24,542 --> 00:12:25,736
Mike, yeah.

228
00:12:25,843 --> 00:12:30,041
What apartment number?

229
00:12:30,147 --> 00:12:33,514
What's the number?

230
00:12:33,618 --> 00:12:36,883
Five minutes.

231
00:12:36,988 --> 00:12:38,148
You're up.

232
00:12:40,658 --> 00:12:41,955
And if I hadn't put my neck
on the line,

233
00:12:42,059 --> 00:12:43,617
they wouldn't have even
given him the job.

234
00:12:43,728 --> 00:12:45,320
You believe that?

235
00:12:50,267 --> 00:12:53,395
Nicky Shades working for Lou.

236
00:12:53,504 --> 00:12:55,904
The world's upside-down.

237
00:12:58,042 --> 00:12:59,407
I work for Lou.

238
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:10,179
Pasta was better
when your mother made it.

239
00:13:15,026 --> 00:13:17,426
Well, I'm going back
to work ...

240
00:13:17,528 --> 00:13:18,517
for Lou.

00:14:16,921 --> 00:14:19,321
Mikey, look.

249
00:14:19,423 --> 00:14:22,290
It's beautiful.

250
00:14:25,362 --> 00:14:26,488
Hey.

251
00:14:26,597 --> 00:14:28,360
Don't you think you have
enough pictures of me?

252
00:14:28,466 --> 00:14:29,455
I love you.

253
00:14:55,092 --> 00:14:58,027
He's not here yet.

254
00:14:58,129 --> 00:14:59,494
I'm just waiting too.

255
00:15:01,332 --> 00:15:03,197
You a photographer?

256
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,734
Yeah, yeah.

257
00:15:05,836 --> 00:15:07,360
Not like him, though.

258
00:15:07,471 --> 00:15:09,939
Well, Reyerson's brilliant.

259
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,440
You know, he spent over a year
with the Maasai.

260
00:15:12,543 --> 00:15:13,532
Yeah, I know.

261
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:16,642
Wouldn't you love
to do something like that?

262
00:15:18,215 --> 00:15:21,241
And drink blood for breakfast?

263
00:15:21,352 --> 00:15:22,341
That's the easy part.

264
00:15:22,453 --> 00:15:24,250
In their culture,
for boys to become men,

265
00:15:24,355 --> 00:15:28,348
they have to kill a lion
with nothing but a spear.

266
00:15:28,459 --> 00:15:30,620
Sorry, sociology major.

267
00:15:30,728 --> 00:15:31,752
Yeah, figured.

268
00:15:31,862 --> 00:15:32,851
I'm Kathy.

269
00:15:32,963 --> 00:15:34,521
- Hi.
- Hi.

270
00:15:34,632 --> 00:15:36,600
Can I help you?

271
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,689
You were here first.

272
00:15:37,802 --> 00:15:39,770
No, go ahead, please.

273
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:41,064
Mike Manadoro.

274
00:15:41,172 --> 00:15:42,696
It's an honor to meet you,
Mr. Rey —

275
00:15:42,807 --> 00:15:44,866
Professor Reyerson.

276
00:15:44,975 --> 00:15:46,636
You're my all-time
favorite photographer.

277
00:15:46,744 --> 00:15:49,679
Well, then you definitely need
photography school.

278
00:15:51,715 --> 00:15:53,478
Manadoro.

279
00:15:53,584 --> 00:15:54,573
Rockaway Beach.

280
00:15:54,685 --> 00:15:56,084
You saw my portfolio.

281
00:15:56,187 --> 00:15:58,747
Of course, I'm on
the scholarship committee.

282
00:15:58,856 --> 00:15:59,845
Wow, thank you.

283
00:15:59,957 --> 00:16:01,185
I mean, if you liked it.

284
00:16:01,292 --> 00:16:03,283
Not that I'm assuming
you liked it.

285
00:16:03,394 --> 00:16:05,862
You got your scholarship,
didn't you?

286
00:16:05,963 --> 00:16:07,988
Yeah, that — that's
actually why I came.

287
00:16:08,098 --> 00:16:10,362
I, um ...

288
00:16:10,467 --> 00:16:12,162
I'm not gonna be able
to come here this year.

289
00:16:12,269 --> 00:16:14,464
Really?

290
00:16:14,572 --> 00:16:15,561
And why is that?

291
00:16:15,673 --> 00:16:18,938
I'm sorry, I —

292
00:16:19,043 --> 00:16:21,102
I — I can't tell you how much
I wanted to study with you.

293
00:16:21,212 --> 00:16:23,806
- No, tell me, how much?
- Excuse me?

294
00:16:23,914 --> 00:16:26,041
How much does photography
mean to you?

295
00:16:29,954 --> 00:16:31,979
It's a family thing
and a financial thing.

296
00:16:33,157 --> 00:16:35,057
I just wanted to tell you
in person.

297
00:16:37,394 --> 00:16:39,885
And you need what?

298
00:16:39,997 --> 00:16:42,022
They just said
that your class was full,

299
00:16:42,132 --> 00:16:44,999
and — and I can't get in
unless you sign a waiver.

300
00:16:45,102 --> 00:16:48,594
Apparently,
there's an opening now.

301
00:16:50,741 --> 00:16:52,368
It's too bad.

302
00:16:52,476 --> 00:16:56,105
You and I had important work
to do together.

303
00:16:59,617 --> 00:17:00,606
Listen.

304
00:17:00,718 --> 00:17:02,743
I feel really weird
about taking your spot.

305
00:17:02,853 --> 00:17:04,150
What happens
if he doesn't do it?

306
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,882
Do what?

307
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:08,083
Kill the lion.

308
00:17:22,606 --> 00:17:23,834
Whoa.
Where the fuck you been?

309
00:17:23,941 --> 00:17:26,034
- Sorry, hit some traffic.
- Traffic?

310
00:17:26,143 --> 00:17:28,134
Come on, you live across
the fuckin' street.

311
00:17:28,245 --> 00:17:29,837
Hey, you're the one that said
you needed the money, right?

312
00:17:29,947 --> 00:17:31,175
Look, you're making me
even later as it is.

313
00:17:31,282 --> 00:17:33,250
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

314
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,908
Don't get your fuckin' Irish
up with me.

315
00:17:35,019 --> 00:17:36,486
Hey, Lou, shut the fuck up,
all right?

316
00:17:36,587 --> 00:17:37,576
Let the kid go.

317
00:17:37,688 --> 00:17:38,677
You go do what you got to do.

318
00:17:38,789 --> 00:17:39,881
Nicky's going with you.

319
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:41,651
Get going.

320
00:17:42,459 --> 00:17:44,086
Let's go.

321
00:17:44,194 --> 00:17:45,183
Check this out.

322
00:17:45,296 --> 00:17:46,285
Ridiculous.

323
00:17:46,397 --> 00:17:47,557
- Bullshit.
- Motherfucker.

324
00:17:47,665 --> 00:17:48,825
Can you believe this?

325
00:17:48,933 --> 00:17:51,060
$11,000 for fuckin'
bathroom fixtures?

326
00:17:51,168 --> 00:17:53,102
I'm gonna stab this cocksucker
with a fuckin' pencil ...

327
00:17:53,203 --> 00:17:54,192
right in his face.

328
00:17:59,443 --> 00:18:00,876
All right,
there it is right there.

329
00:18:00,978 --> 00:18:01,967
- Through there?
- Yep.

330
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:04,377
Oh, nice.

331
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:07,914
By the way,
nothing ever happens,

332
00:18:08,018 --> 00:18:11,249
but it's kind of just in case.

333
00:18:11,355 --> 00:18:12,686
Look at you.

334
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:15,290
Fuck off.

335
00:18:15,392 --> 00:18:17,519
You're coming for the TV.

336
00:18:17,628 --> 00:18:19,892
I know.

337
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:24,698
We should have brought
miner's hats.

338
00:18:27,237 --> 00:18:29,102
Not in there.

339
00:18:29,206 --> 00:18:31,231
In here.

340
00:18:40,951 --> 00:18:42,384
This it?

341
00:18:42,486 --> 00:18:44,920
Hey.

342
00:18:45,022 --> 00:18:46,887
Hey, get up.
Get up!

343
00:18:46,991 --> 00:18:48,356
Is this it?

344
00:18:48,459 --> 00:18:49,448
Just take it.

345
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,585
Let's go.

346
00:18:51,695 --> 00:18:53,959
No.

347
00:18:54,064 --> 00:18:55,656
Why are you taking our TV?

348
00:18:55,766 --> 00:18:57,063
My dad'll pay.

349
00:18:57,167 --> 00:18:58,156
Come on!

350
00:18:58,268 --> 00:19:00,532
Is it too much to turn
a goddamn light on?

351
00:19:06,944 --> 00:19:08,172
This is fucked up.

352
00:19:08,278 --> 00:19:09,438
That scumbag owes you?

353
00:19:09,546 --> 00:19:10,535
No, Tony.

354
00:19:10,647 --> 00:19:11,807
But it's still fucked up, man.

355
00:19:11,915 --> 00:19:13,610
Jesus Christ.
- Well, what do you want to do?

356
00:19:13,717 --> 00:19:14,706
What do you want to do?

357
00:19:14,818 --> 00:19:16,911
You want to go adopt those kids?
You can't think about it.

358
00:19:17,021 --> 00:19:18,181
When I cleared —
listen to me.

359
00:19:18,288 --> 00:19:19,812
When I cleared a house
in Afghanistan,

360
00:19:19,923 --> 00:19:21,720
they lost a lot more
than a fuckin' TV, okay?

361
00:20:04,101 --> 00:20:06,262
It's beautiful, isn't it?

362
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:07,564
Yeah.

363
00:20:07,671 --> 00:20:08,831
It's funny to think ...

364
00:20:08,939 --> 00:20:12,500
that the people that live there
can't see it.

365
00:20:12,609 --> 00:20:13,803
That's because they're in it.

366
00:20:17,915 --> 00:20:20,543
Baby.

367
00:20:20,651 --> 00:20:21,743
I thought we were gonna talk.

368
00:20:21,852 --> 00:20:22,841
Gina.

369
00:20:22,953 --> 00:20:24,477
You don't want to get married?

370
00:20:24,588 --> 00:20:26,283
I want to be able
to afford it.

371
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:28,085
All right, well,
then there's no problem,

372
00:20:28,192 --> 00:20:30,387
'cause Ma said that we could
move in upstairs rent-free.

373
00:20:30,494 --> 00:20:33,986
I'm not taking fuckin' charity
from your mother; I'm not.

374
00:20:34,098 --> 00:20:36,999
I want to be able to pay
my own fair rent.

375
00:20:37,101 --> 00:20:41,231
Things aren't
fuckin' easy, Gina, you know.

376
00:20:41,338 --> 00:20:43,772
Nicky Shades is working
at a fuckin' driving service.

377
00:20:43,874 --> 00:20:46,365
All right, all right.

378
00:20:46,477 --> 00:20:49,002
I just want to be able
to have sex in a bed,

379
00:20:49,113 --> 00:20:51,604
like people.

380
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:54,875
Think I found a guy.

381
00:20:54,985 --> 00:20:57,351
Yeah.

382
00:20:57,454 --> 00:20:59,445
Think I found, uh,
just who I might want to use.

383
00:20:59,556 --> 00:21:01,023
Yes, definitely.

384
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:03,320
Mike, I want to talk to you
about something later,

385
00:21:03,427 --> 00:21:05,759
all right?

386
00:21:05,863 --> 00:21:08,525
All right.

387
00:21:08,632 --> 00:21:10,293
Yeah.

388
00:21:15,739 --> 00:21:17,138
Hey, what's up?

389
00:21:17,241 --> 00:21:18,674
You see the size
of that fuckin' guy?

390
00:21:18,775 --> 00:21:19,764
He's huge.

391
00:21:19,877 --> 00:21:20,866
What's he doing here?

392
00:21:20,978 --> 00:21:22,946
Tony and Lou went to see
a couple of the Albanians ...

393
00:21:23,046 --> 00:21:24,843
down at the gas station
on the parkway ...

394
00:21:24,948 --> 00:21:26,609
to set 'em straight, right?

395
00:21:26,717 --> 00:21:28,446
These guys start yelling.

396
00:21:28,552 --> 00:21:31,316
Tony pulls his gun out,
tells 'em to calm the fuck down.

397
00:21:31,421 --> 00:21:32,410
Next thing you know,

398
00:21:32,523 --> 00:21:33,820
the Albanians
got their guns out,

399
00:21:33,924 --> 00:21:35,323
but they're pointing them
at the gas pumps.

400
00:21:35,425 --> 00:21:36,414
Those fuckin' maniacs,

401
00:21:36,527 --> 00:21:37,960
they were gonna blow up
the whole fuckin' block.

402
00:21:38,061 --> 00:21:39,551
Jesus.

403
00:21:39,663 --> 00:21:41,324
Jimmy, go pick up Mrs. C.

404
00:21:41,431 --> 00:21:42,921
Yeah, boss.

405
00:21:43,033 --> 00:21:44,796
So who the fuck is that guy?

406
00:21:44,902 --> 00:21:46,665
It's Edward;
he's from the Russians,

407
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:48,135
'cause the Russians
are the only ones ...

408
00:21:48,238 --> 00:21:50,968
that won't take shit
from the fuckin' Albanians.

409
00:21:51,074 --> 00:21:52,063
Hey, Mike.

410
00:21:52,176 --> 00:21:53,666
You know, flies,
they shit and they vomit ...

411
00:21:53,777 --> 00:21:54,766
every six seconds.

412
00:21:54,878 --> 00:21:56,038
I saw it on Discovery Channel.

413
00:21:57,247 --> 00:21:58,544
The fuck are you talking about?

414
00:21:58,649 --> 00:21:59,638
The Discovery Channel.

415
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:00,978
Just shut the fuck up.

416
00:22:01,084 --> 00:22:02,346
Where the fuck you been?

417
00:22:02,452 --> 00:22:04,977
I sent you up 2 1/2 hours ago.

418
00:22:05,088 --> 00:22:07,249
I needed to make
another stop.

419
00:22:07,357 --> 00:22:09,382
Ooh, fellas.

420
00:22:09,493 --> 00:22:10,960
Eileen had to make
another stop.

421
00:22:11,061 --> 00:22:13,086
Eileen Zaccaro,
how about this?

422
00:22:13,197 --> 00:22:15,097
Finally made it
with Saint Daniel.

423
00:22:15,199 --> 00:22:18,566
Hey, Danny, I heard
she could suck-start a B-52.

424
00:22:18,669 --> 00:22:19,658
Whoa!

425
00:22:20,938 --> 00:22:24,465
You — you dip your dick
in holy water before you yeah?

426
00:22:24,575 --> 00:22:26,167
Is she converted now?

427
00:22:26,276 --> 00:22:27,368
Seriously, though, Danny,

428
00:22:27,477 --> 00:22:29,001
you better watch out
for Phil Zaccaro.

429
00:22:29,112 --> 00:22:30,101
He's a mean son of a bitch.

430
00:22:30,214 --> 00:22:32,205
He'll cut your fuckin' balls off
and feed 'em to you.

431
00:22:32,316 --> 00:22:34,011
He will.

432
00:22:34,117 --> 00:22:36,108
Four, five, six.

433
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,983
He just shit in your coffee.

434
00:22:38,088 --> 00:22:40,522
Fuckin' stop that with
that shit in people's coffee ...

435
00:22:40,624 --> 00:22:41,648
and all that shit.

436
00:22:41,758 --> 00:22:42,850
Mike, come over here.

437
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,949
No, it's educational.

438
00:22:44,061 --> 00:22:45,824
It's stupid.

439
00:22:45,929 --> 00:22:47,829
Sal, get the phone.

440
00:22:51,301 --> 00:22:53,701
I hear you're looking to make
some extra cash.

441
00:22:53,804 --> 00:22:55,931
I got a little side job for you.

442
00:22:56,039 --> 00:22:57,233
Lou was taking care of it,

443
00:22:57,341 --> 00:23:00,833
but he had differences
with our business associate.

444
00:23:00,944 --> 00:23:02,377
Prick thinks he's my boss.

445
00:23:02,479 --> 00:23:07,041
Anyways, I just need you to
fill in while tempers cool down.

446
00:23:08,685 --> 00:23:09,982
What kind of job?

447
00:23:10,087 --> 00:23:12,920
The way it works is,
you drive out to Oyster Bay.

448
00:23:13,023 --> 00:23:14,581
You pick up a package
from this nigger.

449
00:23:14,691 --> 00:23:15,749
African.

450
00:23:15,859 --> 00:23:17,486
What?

451
00:23:17,594 --> 00:23:21,462
He's Ethiopian,
you ignorant fuck.

452
00:23:21,565 --> 00:23:24,762
You pick up a package
from this Ethiopian nigger,

453
00:23:24,868 --> 00:23:26,733
and you bring it to a hebe
in Borough Park.

454
00:23:26,837 --> 00:23:29,101
What's in the package?

455
00:23:29,206 --> 00:23:31,834
That, my friend,
don't concern you.

456
00:23:31,942 --> 00:23:32,931
Is it drugs?

457
00:23:33,043 --> 00:23:35,136
Look, it pays
two grand a week,

458
00:23:35,245 --> 00:23:37,008
which is enough for you
not to ask questions.

459
00:23:37,114 --> 00:23:38,775
Just for delivering a package.

460
00:23:38,882 --> 00:23:41,214
I need someone trustworthy.

461
00:23:50,394 --> 00:23:52,419
All right.

462
00:23:52,529 --> 00:23:55,521
But ...

463
00:23:55,632 --> 00:23:56,963
I'm gonna need six weeks
up front.

464
00:23:57,067 --> 00:23:58,830
What?

465
00:23:58,935 --> 00:24:00,562
You believe the balls
on this kid?

466
00:24:01,972 --> 00:24:03,667
Little bit every week
won't do me any good,

467
00:24:03,774 --> 00:24:04,763
won't help me out.

468
00:24:04,875 --> 00:24:06,467
I — I need a big chunk.

469
00:24:08,345 --> 00:24:10,438
Okay.

470
00:24:10,547 --> 00:24:13,175
Give the kid his money, Lou.

471
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,878
Big purchase, right?

472
00:24:44,114 --> 00:24:46,378
♪ Meet me, oh, mama ♪

473
00:24:46,483 --> 00:24:48,815

476
00:25:03,033 --> 00:25:05,092
Welcome, come on in.

477
00:25:05,202 --> 00:25:09,536
Please try to sit a little
closer rather than far away.

478
00:25:09,639 --> 00:25:10,628
Hey. Hey.

479
00:25:10,741 --> 00:25:12,106
- What's up, man?
- What class is this?

480
00:25:12,209 --> 00:25:13,836
Soc, dawg.

481
00:25:13,944 --> 00:25:18,540
- What's that?
- Soc.

482
00:25:18,648 --> 00:25:20,172
It's hot, bro.

483
00:25:20,283 --> 00:25:21,272
It's hot.

484
00:25:21,385 --> 00:25:22,374
- Yeah.
- Cool.

485
00:25:22,486 --> 00:25:23,885
You're gonna see
on the syllabus —

486
00:25:23,987 --> 00:25:25,147
Oh, thanks.

487
00:25:25,255 --> 00:25:28,190
Four things we'll be
looking at to begin.

488
00:25:28,291 --> 00:25:29,485
First it's going to be — 

489
00:25:29,593 --> 00:25:30,582
All right.

490
00:25:30,694 --> 00:25:31,991
With an area
of women's rights.

491
00:25:32,095 --> 00:25:34,222
I have women's rights down
'cause it's global.

492
00:25:34,331 --> 00:25:37,323
It'll never end, women's rights.

493
00:25:37,434 --> 00:25:39,698
Thanks.

494
00:25:39,803 --> 00:25:41,031
Hey.

495
00:25:41,138 --> 00:25:42,230
Oh, hi.

496
00:25:42,339 --> 00:25:44,933
So you're coming here
after all.

497
00:25:45,041 --> 00:25:47,066
Yeah, yeah, I managed
to figure it out.

498
00:25:47,177 --> 00:25:48,166
Great.

499
00:25:48,278 --> 00:25:50,269
You're still in
Reyerson's class, right?

500
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,847
Yeah, I'm all registered.

501
00:25:51,948 --> 00:25:54,041
Looks like we have
two classes together.

502
00:25:54,151 --> 00:25:56,346
Yeah, looks that way.

503
00:25:56,453 --> 00:25:59,388
What else are you taking?

504
00:25:59,489 --> 00:26:04,324
Statistics for Social Research
and Language and Liberation.

505
00:26:04,428 --> 00:26:06,896
- Two classes is good.
- Yeah.

506
00:26:06,997 --> 00:26:08,589
What's up, Kat?

507
00:26:08,698 --> 00:26:09,687
Hey, Jared.

508
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,824
How was your weekend?

509
00:26:10,934 --> 00:26:13,767
- I missed you.
- Oh, shut up.

510
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:16,464
Some micro societies.

511
00:26:20,911 --> 00:26:22,572
Right over here.

512
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:24,408
Pull up over here.
Pull up over here.

513
00:26:25,449 --> 00:26:26,746
He's an interesting fucking guy.

514
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:28,613
Thinks he's a big shot
'cause he works at an embassy.

515
00:26:34,391 --> 00:26:36,689
This is Mike, the new guy.

516
00:26:36,793 --> 00:26:38,988
You can call me Todd.

517
00:26:39,095 --> 00:26:41,359
How you doin'?

518
00:26:43,567 --> 00:26:44,625
See you Thursday.

519
00:26:56,179 --> 00:26:57,339
Go ahead.

520
00:26:57,447 --> 00:26:59,347
Only give the bag to this one.

521
00:27:01,184 --> 00:27:02,173
Or him.

522
00:27:03,753 --> 00:27:05,448
Or him.

523
00:27:05,555 --> 00:27:07,750
Anyone else?

524
00:27:07,858 --> 00:27:08,847
Okay, then.

525
00:27:08,959 --> 00:27:10,187
That's it.

526
00:27:10,293 --> 00:27:11,487
Between them and the Spanish,

527
00:27:11,595 --> 00:27:13,028
it's a South Brooklyn
breeding war.

528
00:27:13,129 --> 00:27:15,029
Whoever wins, we lose.

529
00:27:22,939 --> 00:27:24,804
Smells nice in here.

530
00:27:32,482 --> 00:27:34,882
How was your day today?

531
00:27:37,521 --> 00:27:39,580
I was gonna tell you.

532
00:27:42,058 --> 00:27:44,185
When?

533
00:27:44,294 --> 00:27:47,752
Exactly when?

534
00:27:47,864 --> 00:27:50,890
After I look like an asshole
in front of Tony?

535
00:27:51,001 --> 00:27:53,970
After the whole neighborhood
knows before me?

536
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:55,594
I know how you feel
about loans.

537
00:27:55,705 --> 00:27:56,694
I don't give a —

538
00:27:56,806 --> 00:27:58,000
I know how you feel
about loans.

539
00:27:58,108 --> 00:27:59,097
I got to go to school.

540
00:27:59,209 --> 00:28:00,972
I don't give a shit
whether you go to school.

541
00:28:01,077 --> 00:28:02,339
Come here, come here.
Come over here.

542
00:28:02,445 --> 00:28:03,434
Look, look.

543
00:28:03,547 --> 00:28:04,878
See that?
See those guys?

544
00:28:04,981 --> 00:28:06,744
That's what you're gonna be
in ten years.

545
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:09,080
You want that, huh?

546
00:28:09,185 --> 00:28:10,709
Or you're gonna end up
in a dumpster.

547
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:11,809
What the fuck?

548
00:28:11,922 --> 00:28:12,911
Why are you so mad, huh?

549
00:28:13,023 --> 00:28:14,354
You work for Tony.
- I don't work —

550
00:28:14,457 --> 00:28:16,948
- You fuckin' work —
- I don't work for Tony!

551
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:19,255
I give him his cut.

552
00:28:19,362 --> 00:28:22,297
He ain't my boss,
and he ain't my pal.

553
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,154
How much is he paying you?

554
00:28:55,832 --> 00:28:56,821
How much?

555
00:29:00,503 --> 00:29:01,492
Two large a week.

556
00:29:05,208 --> 00:29:07,733
Oh, God.

557
00:29:07,844 --> 00:29:09,277
You got no brains at all?

558
00:29:11,114 --> 00:29:15,414
Two grand a week
for driving a car?

559
00:29:19,122 --> 00:29:21,613
He owns you now.

560
00:29:36,306 --> 00:29:38,501
Did you take out the garbage
this morning?

561
00:29:38,608 --> 00:29:42,135
Because I can smell it.

562
00:30:21,484 --> 00:30:24,214
So why'd you go to bat for me
with Lou that day?

563
00:30:28,758 --> 00:30:30,919
You know, when we were kids,
we all looked up to you,

564
00:30:31,027 --> 00:30:34,019
you know, want to be you.

565
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:36,564
I know I did.

566
00:30:36,666 --> 00:30:38,725
I guess you got your wish.

567
00:30:43,973 --> 00:30:46,737
So what ever happened
to football?

568
00:30:46,843 --> 00:30:47,969
Hey, darlin'.

569
00:30:48,078 --> 00:30:50,069
Can I get one more, please?

570
00:30:53,249 --> 00:30:54,807
I'm getting married.

571
00:30:54,918 --> 00:30:56,283
- No shit.
To who?

572
00:30:56,386 --> 00:30:57,785
Name's Luz.

573
00:30:57,887 --> 00:30:59,411
- Luz?
- Luz.

574
00:30:59,522 --> 00:31:00,511
She's Puerto Rican.

575
00:31:00,623 --> 00:31:02,716
It means "light" in Spanish.

576
00:31:02,826 --> 00:31:03,850
She from the neighborhood?

577
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,224
Nah, her brother
was in my unit.

578
00:31:08,765 --> 00:31:09,857
Hey, want me to get that?

579
00:31:10,066 --> 00:31:11,124
Uh, it's all taken care of.

580
00:31:11,234 --> 00:31:12,997
What are you talking about?

581
00:31:13,103 --> 00:31:14,229
Um, he said,

582
00:31:14,337 --> 00:31:16,897
"Thanks for showing 'em
we ain't afraid."

583
00:31:20,243 --> 00:31:22,040
Here, do me a favor.

584
00:31:22,145 --> 00:31:24,045
Tell him,
"You should be afraid."

585
00:31:33,656 --> 00:31:35,920
Nicky, he's just trying
to be fuckin' nice.

586
00:31:36,025 --> 00:31:38,016
That guy was a fuckin' tit.

587
00:31:42,465 --> 00:31:44,660
Well, listen,
I think I'm taking off.

588
00:31:47,704 --> 00:31:50,138
Go out for a pass.

589
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,229
- What?
- Go out for a pass.

590
00:31:51,341 --> 00:31:52,330
Come on, go.

591
00:31:52,442 --> 00:31:53,636
Go, Mike!

592
00:31:53,743 --> 00:31:54,732
Keep going.

593
00:31:54,844 --> 00:31:56,539
Go, go, go!

594
00:31:58,181 --> 00:31:59,978
Oh, oh, oh,
interference!

595
00:32:00,083 --> 00:32:02,176
Keep going, Mikey,
point in the hook!

596
00:32:05,955 --> 00:32:08,150
Yeah!

597
00:32:08,258 --> 00:32:09,520
Ah!

598
00:32:09,626 --> 00:32:11,651
The rookie
from Narrows Avenue.

599
00:32:11,761 --> 00:32:14,195
He's at the 20, the 10.

600
00:32:14,297 --> 00:32:15,594
Touchdown!

601
00:32:15,698 --> 00:32:16,858
Oh, shit!

602
00:32:16,966 --> 00:32:18,957
Oh, shit.

603
00:32:19,068 --> 00:32:21,195
Put me down.
Put me down.

604
00:32:27,677 --> 00:32:29,008
What's up?

605
00:32:29,112 --> 00:32:33,708
What's up?

606
00:32:33,817 --> 00:32:35,284
You're gorgeous.
What's your name?

607
00:32:35,385 --> 00:32:37,285
What's your name?

608
00:32:37,387 --> 00:32:39,719
Listen to me.
Listen to me.

609
00:32:39,823 --> 00:32:40,812
Listen to me.

610
00:32:44,027 --> 00:32:45,961
Hey, Nicky, Nicky,
you see these guys?

611
00:32:49,966 --> 00:32:54,596
Look at me, baby.

612
00:32:56,773 --> 00:32:58,365
Turn around, turn around.

613
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:02,171
Nicky.

614
00:33:10,653 --> 00:33:11,881
No one takes those off.

615
00:33:13,423 --> 00:33:15,357
Whoa!

616
00:33:15,458 --> 00:33:17,790
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
easy, easy, easy.

617
00:33:17,894 --> 00:33:19,885
Relax, I'm okay.

618
00:33:19,996 --> 00:33:21,486
Get off, please, get off me.

619
00:33:21,598 --> 00:33:22,587
Come on.

620
00:33:22,699 --> 00:33:23,996
Dude,
put the fuckin' camera away ...

621
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,089
and help me up, bro.

622
00:33:25,201 --> 00:33:27,260
I'm okay, bro.
It's okay.

623
00:33:32,709 --> 00:33:33,698
There you go.

624
00:33:40,416 --> 00:33:42,577
This is Mikey Manadoro.

625
00:33:42,685 --> 00:33:46,951
I known Mike
since he was like ...

626
00:33:47,056 --> 00:33:48,990
Oh, I'm fine.
I'm fine.

627
00:33:49,092 --> 00:33:52,084
Get off me.
Get off me, man.

628
00:33:52,195 --> 00:33:53,423
What's up, Mami?

629
00:34:01,638 --> 00:34:04,539
Thanks for the ride, Mike.

630
00:34:04,641 --> 00:34:06,370
Mikey, you want to put
the fuckin' camera down ...

631
00:34:06,476 --> 00:34:07,465
and help me up, please?

632
00:34:15,084 --> 00:34:17,780
So how many of you have
ever been in a darkroom before?

633
00:34:19,055 --> 00:34:20,386
Yes, I know what
you're thinking.

634
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:22,048
You're thinking why on earth
do you bother ...

635
00:34:22,158 --> 00:34:24,183
when you can do in a tenth
of the time on a computer?

636
00:34:24,294 --> 00:34:26,592
That's what you're thinking.

637
00:34:26,696 --> 00:34:27,822
Oh.

638
00:34:27,931 --> 00:34:29,193
What about you?

639
00:34:29,299 --> 00:34:30,493
First time in a darkroom?

640
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,624
Yeah.

641
00:34:31,734 --> 00:34:33,133
Welcome to antiquity.

642
00:34:34,337 --> 00:34:40,606
There is something about silver
and light that is magic.

643
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:42,405
And there's another sort
of magic here too:

644
00:34:42,512 --> 00:34:43,740
mistakes.

645
00:34:43,846 --> 00:34:46,144
You don't get happy accidents
in Photoshop.

646
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:50,045
So let me show you
around the room,

647
00:34:50,153 --> 00:34:52,917
and behind you over there
is our biggest enlarger.

648
00:34:53,022 --> 00:34:54,614
So remember, everyone,

649
00:34:54,724 --> 00:34:56,453
I'm looking for work
from this room,

650
00:34:56,559 --> 00:35:00,051
the film work, and digital work
in your presentation.

651
00:35:00,163 --> 00:35:01,926
Okay, thank you.

652
00:35:06,302 --> 00:35:07,860
You know, I'm really glad
you came.

653
00:35:09,238 --> 00:35:11,297
Thanks.

654
00:35:11,407 --> 00:35:15,070
Well, aren't you
quite the little protégé?

655
00:35:17,714 --> 00:35:18,874
You going somewhere?

656
00:35:18,982 --> 00:35:19,971
Just home.

657
00:35:20,083 --> 00:35:22,916
You want to go get some food?

658
00:35:23,019 --> 00:35:24,008
Now?

659
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,109
Yeah, now.

660
00:35:25,221 --> 00:35:27,018
There's a great place
around here.

661
00:35:27,123 --> 00:35:29,557
I was just gonna try to make
a dent in reading tonight.

662
00:35:29,659 --> 00:35:30,990
Come on, it's my day off.

663
00:35:37,667 --> 00:35:38,827
I just read about this place.

664
00:35:38,935 --> 00:35:39,924
Oh, yeah?

665
00:35:40,036 --> 00:35:41,025
Then come on in.

666
00:35:41,137 --> 00:35:42,695
I bet you're gonna like it.

667
00:35:42,805 --> 00:35:43,999
Hey.
- Mikey.

668
00:35:44,107 --> 00:35:46,132
- How are you?
- Little Mikey.

669
00:35:46,242 --> 00:35:47,231
You look good.

670
00:35:47,343 --> 00:35:48,332
How's your father?

671
00:35:48,444 --> 00:35:49,911
He's okay, you know,
same as always.

672
00:35:50,013 --> 00:35:51,742
- This is Kathy.
- Bella signorina.

673
00:35:51,848 --> 00:35:53,372
Yeah, not bad.

674
00:35:53,483 --> 00:35:56,281
Let me see what I can
fix for you.

675
00:35:56,386 --> 00:35:57,375
How about over here?

676
00:35:57,487 --> 00:35:59,079
Yeah.

677
00:35:59,188 --> 00:36:01,315
Right near the window,
you get a little air.

678
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,926
Thank you.

679
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:08,019
Thanks a lot.

680
00:36:08,131 --> 00:36:09,120
My pleasure.

681
00:36:09,232 --> 00:36:11,359
Be right back.
- Okay.

682
00:36:13,002 --> 00:36:13,991
You ever been?

683
00:36:14,103 --> 00:36:15,502
- Italy?
No.

684
00:36:15,605 --> 00:36:16,799
Oh, God, I wish.

685
00:36:16,906 --> 00:36:18,965
I'm gonna do a summer session
there in Florence.

686
00:36:19,075 --> 00:36:20,099
Wow, that's great.

687
00:36:20,209 --> 00:36:21,506
Yeah, I'm excited.

688
00:36:21,611 --> 00:36:22,908
It was an easier sell
to my parents ...

689
00:36:23,012 --> 00:36:26,573
than a Maasai hut
made of cow dung, so ...

690
00:36:26,682 --> 00:36:28,274
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

691
00:36:28,384 --> 00:36:30,113
Some antipasto on the house.
- Thank you.

692
00:36:30,219 --> 00:36:32,084
Enjoy.

693
00:36:33,823 --> 00:36:36,053
Thanks.

694
00:36:36,159 --> 00:36:37,956
Well, you must be
quite the regular.

695
00:36:38,061 --> 00:36:41,053
Oh, my father used to work
with the owner in sanitation.

696
00:36:41,164 --> 00:36:43,655
Sanitation like the mob
or real garbage?

697
00:36:43,766 --> 00:36:45,131
We don't use that word.

698
00:36:45,234 --> 00:36:47,134
- What, mob?
- Garbage.

699
00:36:49,572 --> 00:36:51,836
- Oh.
- I'm just kidding.

700
00:36:51,941 --> 00:36:53,875
Relax, it's fine.

701
00:36:53,976 --> 00:36:56,501
Anyway, he — he doesn't
work there anymore.

702
00:36:56,612 --> 00:36:58,170
He — he was in an accident.

703
00:36:58,281 --> 00:36:59,908
He's on working compensation.

704
00:37:00,016 --> 00:37:01,142
Is he okay?

705
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:02,239
Yeah, he's fine.

706
00:37:02,351 --> 00:37:03,648
He's just got a bit of a limp,

707
00:37:03,753 --> 00:37:05,880
and to be honest, it's actually
probably better for him,

708
00:37:05,988 --> 00:37:08,548
'cause he — he likes
to dress up all nice.

709
00:37:08,658 --> 00:37:11,024
He never used to wear
his work clothes in front of us.

710
00:37:11,127 --> 00:37:12,560
He'd always bring a bag
to work with him ...

711
00:37:12,662 --> 00:37:14,857
and change before he got home.

712
00:37:14,964 --> 00:37:17,398
Kind of like
he had to separate his job ...

713
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,161
from his identity.

714
00:37:20,603 --> 00:37:21,592
What?

715
00:37:21,704 --> 00:37:24,138
Nothing, I just feel like
I got a bone in my nose,

716
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,367
and I'm the chief
of the next weird tribe ...

717
00:37:26,476 --> 00:37:27,534
you're gonna go investigate.

718
00:37:27,643 --> 00:37:30,168
I don't —

719
00:37:30,279 --> 00:37:31,576
Why don't you just
have some wine ...

720
00:37:31,681 --> 00:37:32,705
and relax a little bit?

721
00:37:35,351 --> 00:37:36,340
Okay.

722
00:37:42,792 --> 00:37:45,283
So you think you're
the chief of the tribe?

723
00:37:45,394 --> 00:37:47,055
Jesus Christ,
you don't stop?

724
00:37:47,163 --> 00:37:48,562
What?

725
00:37:48,664 --> 00:37:49,653
I'm sorry, I know.

726
00:37:49,765 --> 00:37:51,323
It's actually — 
it's really terrible.

727
00:37:51,434 --> 00:37:52,423
I shouldn't do that.

728
00:37:52,535 --> 00:37:54,059
I shouldn't
psychoanalyze people.

729
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:56,502
I was psychoanalyzed
my whole life.

730
00:37:56,606 --> 00:37:58,904
My mother's a psychiatrist,
so ...

731
00:37:59,008 --> 00:38:00,373
What does your —

732
00:38:00,476 --> 00:38:02,103
what does your mom
say about you?

733
00:38:02,211 --> 00:38:05,738
That I'm a classic borderline
histrionic cerebral narcissist.

734
00:38:07,116 --> 00:38:08,777
Wow.

735
00:38:08,885 --> 00:38:10,250
When my mother got mad at me,

736
00:38:10,353 --> 00:38:12,344
she just called me
my middle name.

737
00:38:12,455 --> 00:38:13,444
Well, you're lucky.

738
00:38:13,556 --> 00:38:15,456
No, no, you don't know
my middle name.

739
00:38:15,558 --> 00:38:16,582
What is it?

740
00:38:18,294 --> 00:38:19,454
Oh, come on, you can't do that.

741
00:38:19,562 --> 00:38:20,551
You can't not tell me now.

742
00:38:20,663 --> 00:38:21,652
No, I'm not telling you.

743
00:38:21,764 --> 00:38:23,994
It's awful.
- What is it?

744
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:26,500
Tell me your middle name,
and we'll be even.

745
00:38:26,602 --> 00:38:28,729
Gandolfo.

746
00:38:29,939 --> 00:38:30,928
Go ahead and laugh.

747
00:38:36,913 --> 00:38:37,902
Gandolfo.

748
00:38:38,014 --> 00:38:39,003
- Ciao.
- Ciao.

749
00:38:39,115 --> 00:38:40,605
- You're a beautiful lady.
- Ciao, grazie.

750
00:38:40,716 --> 00:38:42,650
- Hey, go easy on the lady.
- All right, you too.

751
00:38:42,752 --> 00:38:43,878
- Come on.
- Good night.

752
00:38:45,521 --> 00:38:47,648
Your Italian is fantastic.

753
00:38:47,757 --> 00:38:49,816
Oh, no, it's — it's really not.

754
00:38:49,926 --> 00:38:51,917
I — I fake it much better
than I speak it.

755
00:38:52,028 --> 00:38:53,962
No, I think you're ready
for Florence tomorrow.

756
00:38:54,063 --> 00:38:56,964
I think I'm gonna have to do
a little more.

757
00:38:57,066 --> 00:38:58,863
You all right?

758
00:38:58,968 --> 00:39:00,128
I'm sorry.

759
00:39:00,236 --> 00:39:02,796
- You all right?
- Yeah.

760
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:19,411
I'm gonna drive you home.

761
00:39:19,522 --> 00:39:20,511
What?

762
00:39:20,623 --> 00:39:22,022
I'm gonna drive you home.

763
00:39:22,124 --> 00:39:23,352
You have a car?

764
00:39:23,459 --> 00:39:25,154
Yeah, of course I have a car.

765
00:39:25,261 --> 00:39:26,751
What, "Of course I have a car"?

766
00:39:26,862 --> 00:39:29,023
Nobody in Manhattan has a car.

767
00:39:29,131 --> 00:39:30,496
I'm not from Manhattan.

768
00:39:42,245 --> 00:39:43,473
What?

769
00:39:45,248 --> 00:39:48,183
- Sorry, I got to get —
- It's okay.

770
00:39:48,284 --> 00:39:49,273
Hello?

771
00:39:49,385 --> 00:39:50,943
Nicky broke down
on the Gowanus.

772
00:39:51,053 --> 00:39:52,042
Fuck, not again.

773
00:39:52,154 --> 00:39:54,054
He's getting a tow,
and I'm giving him your car.

774
00:39:54,156 --> 00:39:55,145
What?

775
00:39:55,258 --> 00:39:56,350
No, no, no, I'm in the city.

776
00:39:56,459 --> 00:39:57,448
Mike, Mike, Mike!

777
00:39:59,028 --> 00:40:00,290
- Are you okay?
- No, I'm okay.

778
00:40:00,396 --> 00:40:01,590
Are you sure you're all right?

779
00:40:01,697 --> 00:40:02,789
You made a fuckin' promise.

780
00:40:02,898 --> 00:40:04,559
If you don't get your ass
in here right now,

781
00:40:04,667 --> 00:40:06,100
you're gonna be back
to repo-ing —

782
00:40:11,507 --> 00:40:13,634
Um ...

783
00:40:13,743 --> 00:40:16,769
l — I drive car service,
and sometimes it's at night.

784
00:40:16,879 --> 00:40:18,608
I — It's for protection.

785
00:40:18,714 --> 00:40:20,272
No, it — it's fine.

786
00:40:20,383 --> 00:40:21,714
You know, I'm almost
home anyway.

787
00:40:21,817 --> 00:40:22,806
So I'll just walk.

788
00:40:22,918 --> 00:40:23,907
No, no, it's all right.

789
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:26,955
I want to drive you home.

790
00:40:39,335 --> 00:40:40,597
Hey, Nicky, it's Mike.

791
00:40:40,703 --> 00:40:41,931
Couldn't find you
under the Gowanus,

792
00:40:42,038 --> 00:40:45,337
and don't crash my car
or anything, 'cause I need it.

793
00:40:45,441 --> 00:40:46,430
I'm waiting — 

794
00:40:46,542 --> 00:40:48,009
Mike, they're fuckin'
killing Danny!

795
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:49,338
They're killing fucking Danny!

796
00:40:49,445 --> 00:40:50,776
What the fuck
you talking about?

797
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:51,972
Fuckin' around the corner.

798
00:40:52,081 --> 00:40:54,777
What the fuck are they doing?

799
00:40:54,884 --> 00:40:56,909
Danny, Danny!
- Mike, stop!

800
00:40:57,019 --> 00:40:58,987
Stop!

801
00:40:59,088 --> 00:41:01,579
Lou said he wouldn't do it
unless Zac cleared it by Tony.

802
00:41:01,691 --> 00:41:03,556
Come to my fuckin' house, huh?

803
00:41:03,659 --> 00:41:05,490
Sniffin' around
with my fuckin' wife, eh?

804
00:41:05,594 --> 00:41:06,583
Stupid.

805
00:41:06,696 --> 00:41:08,926
- Get ready to see Jesus.
- Mike, no!

806
00:41:09,031 --> 00:41:11,465
Fuckin' asshole!

807
00:41:11,567 --> 00:41:13,262
Who the fuck are you?

808
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:17,134
Fuckin' shit.

809
00:41:23,012 --> 00:41:24,001
Shades ...

810
00:41:24,113 --> 00:41:26,206
this ain't about you.

811
00:41:26,315 --> 00:41:27,907
Well, let's keep it
that way then, Phil.

812
00:41:35,891 --> 00:41:37,688
We're done here.

813
00:41:42,331 --> 00:41:43,696
- Fuckin' payback.
- Hey, Phil.

814
00:41:43,799 --> 00:41:45,198
It's over.

815
00:41:45,301 --> 00:41:46,563
Okay?

816
00:41:46,669 --> 00:41:48,136
All right.

817
00:41:53,142 --> 00:41:55,770
You all right?

818
00:41:55,878 --> 00:41:57,106
Look at me, look at me.

819
00:41:57,213 --> 00:41:58,646
Danny, it's Nicky.
I'm right here.

820
00:41:58,748 --> 00:42:00,215
I'm putting my hand
behind your head.

821
00:42:00,316 --> 00:42:01,305
Take it easy.

822
00:42:01,417 --> 00:42:02,679
No, no, don't talk.
Your jaw's broken.

823
00:42:02,785 --> 00:42:04,184
Mike, pull the car around.

824
00:42:04,286 --> 00:42:06,686
We got to get him
to the hospital.

825
00:42:06,789 --> 00:42:07,778
I got you.

826
00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:08,948
Give me a nice, deep breath.

827
00:42:09,058 --> 00:42:10,582
I know.
I know, I know, I know.

828
00:42:10,693 --> 00:42:11,682
It's terrible.

829
00:42:11,794 --> 00:42:12,783
I got you, pal.

830
00:42:23,239 --> 00:42:28,575
♪ Junkie walkin'
through the twilight ♪

831
00:42:28,677 --> 00:42:30,008
♪ I'm on my way home ♪

832
00:42:30,446 --> 00:42:31,743
But here's the thing.

833
00:42:31,847 --> 00:42:33,178
It's the best place
I've ever been.

834
00:42:33,282 --> 00:42:37,480
Snow-covered mountains,
fields of fuckin' red poppies.

835
00:42:37,586 --> 00:42:38,712
Nick, what the fuck are you —

836
00:42:38,821 --> 00:42:39,810
Shh.

837
00:42:39,922 --> 00:42:42,482
And nobody fucks with you,

838
00:42:42,591 --> 00:42:44,923
'cause you got a weapon on you
taller than they are.

839
00:42:46,929 --> 00:42:48,920
It almost lets you believe
you're winning.

840
00:43:05,214 --> 00:43:06,875
Nice, right?

841
00:43:06,982 --> 00:43:08,176
RPG hit our convoy,

842
00:43:08,284 --> 00:43:10,252
and my fuckin' knee
is shot to shit.

843
00:43:10,352 --> 00:43:11,512
Bye-bye, football.

844
00:43:15,624 --> 00:43:20,084
But with the morphine
they gave me back in Kandahar,

845
00:43:20,196 --> 00:43:24,792
I won the fuckin' Super Bowl
every day.

846
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:28,963
Shouldn't you stop before you
have your kid, though?

847
00:43:29,071 --> 00:43:31,198
All I'm saying is,
you fuckin' made it back, okay?

848
00:43:31,307 --> 00:43:32,399
You made it back.

849
00:43:32,508 --> 00:43:34,100
You don't want to die
in Brooklyn, do you?

850
00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:36,144
Sal says you die in Brooklyn,
God says, "Fuck you."

851
00:43:36,245 --> 00:43:37,735
You want that?

852
00:43:37,847 --> 00:43:39,838
God already told me,
"Fuck you."

853
00:44:05,074 --> 00:44:06,541
It's 4:00 in the morning.

854
00:44:08,177 --> 00:44:10,475
Come on.

855
00:44:19,855 --> 00:44:21,755
You're so beautiful.

856
00:44:21,857 --> 00:44:24,417
Isn't she beautiful, Mike?

857
00:44:24,527 --> 00:44:26,154
Look at this belly.

858
00:44:28,030 --> 00:44:29,327
Get your camera.

859
00:44:29,431 --> 00:44:30,921
Let's take pictures, come on.

860
00:44:31,033 --> 00:44:33,160
Yeah, we'll show 'em
to the kid one day, come on.

861
00:44:33,269 --> 00:44:34,930
- No.
- Take our pictures.

862
00:44:35,037 --> 00:44:36,766
Take off your glasses.

863
00:44:40,276 --> 00:44:42,369
Take 'em off.

864
00:44:56,225 --> 00:44:57,214
Can I see?

865
00:45:11,006 --> 00:45:11,995
You look tired.

866
00:45:12,107 --> 00:45:13,699
Yeah.

867
00:45:13,809 --> 00:45:14,935
Let's go to bed.

868
00:45:18,213 --> 00:45:19,202
Good night, Mike.

869
00:45:19,315 --> 00:45:21,408
Yeah, I should go too.

870
00:45:24,553 --> 00:45:27,784
Well.

871
00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:28,879
Oh.

872
00:45:33,896 --> 00:45:36,524
Wake up, Mike.

873
00:45:36,632 --> 00:45:39,965
I'm not the neighborhood hero.

874
00:45:57,686 --> 00:45:59,745
Listen, our over-arching theme
should be  ...

875
00:45:59,855 --> 00:46:02,585
deviance in the age
of globalization.

876
00:46:02,691 --> 00:46:04,215
One country's legal punishment ...

877
00:46:04,326 --> 00:46:05,759
is another's
human rights violation.

878
00:46:05,861 --> 00:46:06,919
That's moral relativism.

879
00:46:07,029 --> 00:46:08,018
It is all relative.

880
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:10,030
Not if you're a victim
of female circumcision.

881
00:46:10,132 --> 00:46:11,326
Oh, okay, see that's nasty.

882
00:46:11,433 --> 00:46:12,730
It's not a crime
in their culture.

883
00:46:12,835 --> 00:46:14,132
- What?
- Check it.

884
00:46:14,236 --> 00:46:16,033
Most 187s, they had head trauma.

885
00:46:16,138 --> 00:46:17,901
They'd get beat the shit
out of by their dads.

886
00:46:18,007 --> 00:46:20,237
Yeah, violence is directly
related to testosterone.

887
00:46:20,342 --> 00:46:22,207
No, it's poverty.

888
00:46:22,311 --> 00:46:23,471
Crime goes up — 

889
00:46:23,579 --> 00:46:26,343
And as I was saying
before I was interrupted,

890
00:46:26,448 --> 00:46:28,746
most crimes are committed
by young males,

891
00:46:28,851 --> 00:46:31,251
regardless of wealth,
race, or nationality.

892
00:46:31,353 --> 00:46:33,446
Mike, what do you think?

893
00:46:33,555 --> 00:46:35,785
I think she's lazy as shit.

894
00:46:35,891 --> 00:46:38,155
This school costs
$12,800 a semester.

895
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:42,424
Divide that by four courses,
14 weeks, one class per week.

896
00:46:42,531 --> 00:46:45,864
It's basically $233
we're pissing away here,

897
00:46:45,968 --> 00:46:48,630
talking amongst ourselves.

898
00:46:48,737 --> 00:46:51,137
It's not
sociologically irrelevant.

899
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:53,572
Didn't you read
in the course description ...

900
00:46:53,676 --> 00:46:54,973
that we were
gonna be doing this?

901
00:46:55,077 --> 00:46:56,374
Are you the leader
of this group?

902
00:46:56,478 --> 00:46:58,070
Because I don't remember
voting for you.

903
00:46:59,615 --> 00:47:00,877
Jesus Christ.

904
00:47:00,983 --> 00:47:03,611
We're supposed to agree
on a topic today.

905
00:47:03,719 --> 00:47:05,050
I mean, you do realize that?

906
00:47:05,154 --> 00:47:07,122
Then I agree with her.

907
00:47:07,222 --> 00:47:09,520
Most crimes are done by men ...

908
00:47:09,625 --> 00:47:11,252
whether it be for money
or status.

909
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:13,851
Bottom line is,

910
00:47:13,962 --> 00:47:16,021
it's basically who's got
the biggest swinging dick.

911
00:47:16,131 --> 00:47:17,496
Am I supposed
to be intimidated ...

912
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:19,294
'cause you get into bar fights?

913
00:47:19,401 --> 00:47:21,528
All right,
that's enough for today.

914
00:47:21,637 --> 00:47:25,073
Remember, next week,
we will divide the research.

915
00:47:25,174 --> 00:47:27,233
That was productive.

916
00:47:27,342 --> 00:47:28,331
Asshole.

917
00:47:28,444 --> 00:47:29,968
Easy, all.

918
00:47:35,984 --> 00:47:37,645
We're supposed to study
in the library now.

919
00:47:37,753 --> 00:47:41,416
I didn't think you'd want to.

920
00:47:41,523 --> 00:47:43,388
How did you get that?

921
00:47:43,492 --> 00:47:44,925
Polo mallet.

922
00:47:47,763 --> 00:47:49,663
I broke up a fight, all right?

923
00:47:49,765 --> 00:47:51,596
What do you want me to say?

924
00:47:54,970 --> 00:47:58,201
That thing
in your glove box ...

925
00:47:58,307 --> 00:48:00,571
have you ever had to use it?

926
00:48:09,418 --> 00:48:11,147
Big Blue recovers
on the turnover.

927
00:48:11,253 --> 00:48:14,245
Looks like Lamm came up with it.

928
00:48:14,356 --> 00:48:16,381
And that gives Denny Lane
and the Big Blue a chance — 

929
00:48:16,492 --> 00:48:19,290
He's gonna score
on this next possession.

930
00:48:19,394 --> 00:48:20,691
Just on the edge
of the red zone,

931
00:48:20,796 --> 00:48:22,991
just outside the 20.

932
00:48:23,098 --> 00:48:24,292
And now they're in the red zone.

933
00:48:24,399 --> 00:48:25,923
Walker threw it.

934
00:48:26,034 --> 00:48:28,059
Score, touchdown.

935
00:48:28,170 --> 00:48:30,832
21-yard —
- You called it.

936
00:48:30,939 --> 00:48:32,338
It's just your fan belt,
by the way.

937
00:48:32,441 --> 00:48:33,430
It's not a big deal.

938
00:48:33,542 --> 00:48:36,705
Thanks.

939
00:48:36,812 --> 00:48:38,803
That really makes me
fuckin' sick.

940
00:48:40,949 --> 00:48:42,348
It's just a collection,
you know?

941
00:48:42,451 --> 00:48:44,942
Name of the fuckin' game.
- Bullshit.

942
00:48:45,053 --> 00:48:49,285
Tony is just like every other
piece of shit terrorist cunt.

943
00:48:49,391 --> 00:48:50,790
He's a fuckin' cancer.

944
00:48:50,893 --> 00:48:53,691
He needs to be taken out.

945
00:48:55,898 --> 00:48:57,559
Let's go get a beer, huh?

946
00:49:21,490 --> 00:49:24,391
♪ Girl is on my mind ♪

947
00:49:29,631 --> 00:49:31,189
Get off me.

948
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:33,928
My brother's gonna be mad
we're missing his barbecue.

949
00:49:39,441 --> 00:49:42,001
Oh, God, look at that.

950
00:49:42,110 --> 00:49:43,099
Mm, you smell that?

951
00:49:43,212 --> 00:49:44,440
Freshly baked every day.

952
00:49:44,546 --> 00:49:47,014
Santo's, heart
of the old country, baby.

953
00:49:52,054 --> 00:49:53,043
What?

954
00:49:54,389 --> 00:49:56,914
You sound like one of those
old guys down at Tony's.

955
00:50:01,230 --> 00:50:03,824
Why'd you take this job?

956
00:50:03,932 --> 00:50:05,126
It's not like you.

957
00:50:05,234 --> 00:50:07,600
Maybe I'm tired of being me.

958
00:50:09,605 --> 00:50:11,368
You don't want to end up
like my father.

959
00:50:11,473 --> 00:50:14,601
Your father was
in a car accident.

960
00:50:14,710 --> 00:50:15,699
That's different.

961
00:50:15,811 --> 00:50:17,210
What, you think I'm an idiot?

962
00:50:17,312 --> 00:50:20,645
The only person that believes
that is my mother.

963
00:50:20,749 --> 00:50:23,650
My father got run over
by one of Tony's guys ...

964
00:50:23,752 --> 00:50:25,117
for his gambling debt.

965
00:50:27,689 --> 00:50:31,386
I'm not in college,
but I know more than you think.

966
00:50:34,863 --> 00:50:36,797
Be careful, baby.

967
00:50:36,899 --> 00:50:37,888
All right?

968
00:50:41,036 --> 00:50:43,266
I'll see you next week.

969
00:50:44,473 --> 00:50:47,340
Stop.

970
00:50:47,442 --> 00:50:50,639
What's that for?

971
00:50:50,746 --> 00:50:53,237
Oh, nothing.

972
00:50:53,348 --> 00:50:54,508
I study photography.

973
00:50:59,354 --> 00:51:01,015
Come inside.

974
00:51:13,835 --> 00:51:16,395
A lot activity in there
for 10:00 in the morning.

975
00:51:16,505 --> 00:51:19,235
It's an Irish bar.

976
00:51:19,341 --> 00:51:21,366
They don't need a reason.

977
00:51:21,476 --> 00:51:22,909
- Hey, how you doin', yeah?
- What's up?

978
00:51:23,011 --> 00:51:25,206
- Same lucky three, huh?
All right.

979
00:51:28,684 --> 00:51:30,345
- Hey, same time tomorrow.
- Yeah, yeah.

980
00:51:30,452 --> 00:51:31,441
Take care of that leg.

981
00:51:31,553 --> 00:51:33,987
Be nice, be nice.

982
00:51:39,795 --> 00:51:43,424
Am I dreamin',
or did you honk at me?

983
00:51:43,532 --> 00:51:45,466
I got class in, like,
half an hour.

984
00:51:45,567 --> 00:51:47,728
What do you want me to do?

985
00:51:55,243 --> 00:51:59,339
Tony is inviting you
to poker night.

986
00:52:00,649 --> 00:52:01,673
I can't.

987
00:52:01,783 --> 00:52:02,772
I got to be in the darkroom,

988
00:52:02,884 --> 00:52:05,409
and I got
a sociology presentation.

989
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:06,509
Stop the car.

990
00:52:06,621 --> 00:52:08,555
- I'm already —
- Stop the car!

991
00:52:08,657 --> 00:52:10,454
Jesus Christ!

992
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:11,992
What, huh?

993
00:52:12,094 --> 00:52:13,083
What?
- The Sociology ...

994
00:52:13,195 --> 00:52:15,129
- I don't even like the guy.
You don't like the guy.

995
00:52:15,230 --> 00:52:19,599
of Deviance.

996
00:52:19,701 --> 00:52:23,159
You want to know
about the sociology of here?

997
00:52:23,271 --> 00:52:26,604
You ever wonder why you never
got your ass kicked in school?

998
00:52:26,708 --> 00:52:30,610
I have looked after you
your whole life.

999
00:52:34,216 --> 00:52:40,382
I have used my relationships
with certain people ...

1000
00:52:40,489 --> 00:52:43,515
to your advantage.

1001
00:52:45,927 --> 00:52:49,055
Now, I am not telling Tony ...

1002
00:52:49,164 --> 00:52:51,291
that the guy he just gave
12 grand to ...

1003
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:54,892
has got better things to do.

1004
00:52:57,005 --> 00:52:59,371
Well, you should
keep on working.

1005
00:52:59,474 --> 00:53:01,169
These aren't due till Monday.

1006
00:53:01,276 --> 00:53:02,265
No, it's all right.

1007
00:53:02,377 --> 00:53:03,708
I want to hand 'em in now.

1008
00:53:03,812 --> 00:53:05,370
You shouldn't.

1009
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:06,742
They're no good.

1010
00:53:10,519 --> 00:53:12,544
Can we talk outside
for a second?

1011
00:53:19,795 --> 00:53:23,492
I'm sorry, but the last
presentation, lowly interiors,

1012
00:53:23,598 --> 00:53:26,032
was ten shots inside
of a janitor's closet.

1013
00:53:26,134 --> 00:53:27,897
The one before that
was armpits and feet.

1014
00:53:28,003 --> 00:53:29,129
What do you want me to do?

1015
00:53:29,237 --> 00:53:30,534
Worry about your own work.

1016
00:53:30,639 --> 00:53:33,699
Ah, Toni, yeah,
I'll see those later.

1017
00:53:33,809 --> 00:53:35,037
Look, if you don't
like my stuff,

1018
00:53:35,143 --> 00:53:36,610
why'd you give me
the scholarship?

1019
00:53:36,711 --> 00:53:38,338
Because I thought
I could teach you.

1020
00:53:38,447 --> 00:53:40,142
The scholarships aren't
a pat on the back,

1021
00:53:40,248 --> 00:53:41,374
if that's
what you think they are.

1022
00:53:41,483 --> 00:53:42,472
I didn't say that.

1023
00:53:42,584 --> 00:53:46,042
The work in your portfolio was
much more interesting than this.

1024
00:53:46,154 --> 00:53:49,453
The Verrazano Bridge at night,
a sidewalk cafe,

1025
00:53:49,558 --> 00:53:52,118
I can get these on postcards
at the chamber of commerce.

1026
00:53:52,227 --> 00:53:54,457
When did you stop
taking portraits?

1027
00:53:54,563 --> 00:53:57,498
Your work was so personal.

1028
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:01,296
Now it's just like you're trying
to be as generic as possible,

1029
00:54:01,403 --> 00:54:02,665
trying to blend in.

1030
00:54:06,508 --> 00:54:07,497
I do have other stuff.

1031
00:54:07,609 --> 00:54:08,940
It's just
not for everyone, okay?

1032
00:54:09,044 --> 00:54:10,739
Yeah, like that pretty girl
you sit next to.

1033
00:54:10,846 --> 00:54:13,246
Well, she's not grading you;
I am.

1034
00:54:13,348 --> 00:54:14,975
I need to see something realer,

1035
00:54:15,083 --> 00:54:18,575
something with
a point of view, eh?

1036
00:54:18,687 --> 00:54:21,247
And, Mike,
you've got to work harder.

1037
00:54:21,356 --> 00:54:23,517
Your mates are in the darkroom
until midnight.

1038
00:54:23,625 --> 00:54:26,651
You barely make it to class
on time.

1039
00:54:26,761 --> 00:54:29,025
And don't ever ask me
to step outside again,

1040
00:54:29,131 --> 00:54:30,120
like we're in a bar.

1041
00:54:33,535 --> 00:54:35,264
Hey, you want to
skip the library ...

1042
00:54:35,370 --> 00:54:36,894
and maybe get a drink?

1043
00:54:37,005 --> 00:54:38,495
We have to work.

1044
00:54:38,607 --> 00:54:39,596
What about Rocco's?

1045
00:54:39,708 --> 00:54:40,766
You like that place, right?

1046
00:54:40,876 --> 00:54:42,901
Oh, sure.

1047
00:54:43,011 --> 00:54:46,174
So it's me, then.

1048
00:54:46,281 --> 00:54:49,717
Look, we're just
really different, okay?

1049
00:54:49,818 --> 00:54:51,513
And I'm not saying that
that's a bad thing.

1050
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:56,080
It's just with two classes
and a project, it's risky.

1051
00:54:56,191 --> 00:54:58,557
It could get awkward.

1052
00:54:58,660 --> 00:55:00,321
Awkward.

1053
00:55:02,330 --> 00:55:03,729
Look where you're going,
asshole.

1054
00:55:03,832 --> 00:55:05,060
What the fuck
did you say to me?

1055
00:55:05,167 --> 00:55:06,657
What the fuck
did you say to me, huh?

1056
00:55:06,768 --> 00:55:07,757
I'm sorry, take it easy.

1057
00:55:07,869 --> 00:55:08,893
I'm sorry, I made a mistake.

1058
00:55:09,004 --> 00:55:10,403
I'm sorry.

1059
00:55:34,763 --> 00:55:38,859
Wait.

1060
00:55:38,967 --> 00:55:40,867
It's okay.

1061
00:55:58,587 --> 00:55:59,747
Hi.

1062
00:56:01,022 --> 00:56:02,114
Hi.

1063
00:56:59,214 --> 00:57:01,978
- Oh!
- Jesus.

1064
00:57:02,083 --> 00:57:03,744
Sorry.

1065
00:57:08,757 --> 00:57:11,555
You leaving?

1066
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:12,888
No, I just moved my car.

1067
00:57:12,994 --> 00:57:14,962
I used your keys.

1068
00:57:23,371 --> 00:57:24,702
Do you want me to leave?

1069
00:57:24,806 --> 00:57:27,274
No.

1070
00:57:27,375 --> 00:57:29,309
No, don't be stupid.

1071
00:57:34,816 --> 00:57:37,341
You must think I'm crazy.

1072
00:57:37,452 --> 00:57:39,113
What?

1073
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:41,620
No, hey, no.

1074
00:57:41,723 --> 00:57:44,021
I tell you it's too risky,
and then here we are,

1075
00:57:44,125 --> 00:57:47,959
and I'm leaving for the summer,

1076
00:57:48,063 --> 00:57:49,826
and you probably
have a girlfriend anyway.

1077
00:57:49,931 --> 00:57:52,365
Is that — is that her
on your chest?

1078
00:57:56,204 --> 00:57:59,173
That's my mother.

1079
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:07,470
I'm sorry.

1080
00:58:07,582 --> 00:58:08,571
It's okay.

1081
00:58:08,683 --> 00:58:09,843
Hey, hey.

1082
00:58:09,951 --> 00:58:12,044
It's okay.

1083
00:58:12,153 --> 00:58:14,018
You didn't know.

1084
00:58:18,493 --> 00:58:20,017
What kind of guy
leaves a girl like you ...

1085
00:58:20,128 --> 00:58:22,562
in the middle of the night?

1086
00:58:25,734 --> 00:58:27,531

Where were you last night?

1111
00:59:46,281 --> 00:59:47,839
I stayed at a friend's place
in the city.

1112
00:59:47,949 --> 00:59:49,177
Don't worry about it.
- Yeah, who?

1113
00:59:49,284 --> 00:59:51,115
Listen, can we just
get out of here, all right?

1114
00:59:51,219 --> 00:59:53,050
It's a little fuckin' awkward,
don't you think?

1115
00:59:53,154 --> 00:59:54,143
- Awkward?
- Yeah.

1116
00:59:54,255 --> 00:59:55,244
Oh, awkward.

1117
00:59:55,356 --> 00:59:56,846
What is that,
your new word from college?

1118
00:59:56,958 --> 00:59:57,947
Jesus Christ, Gina,

1119
00:59:58,059 --> 00:59:59,993
let's just go fuckin' talk
someplace, all right?

1120
01:00:00,094 --> 01:00:02,289
We need to talk.
- Oh, so now you want to talk.

1121
01:00:02,397 --> 01:00:03,864
Yeah.

1122
01:00:03,965 --> 01:00:05,364
I left you four messages.

1123
01:00:05,467 --> 01:00:06,593
Jesus Christ, Gina,

1124
01:00:06,701 --> 01:00:08,293
let's just fuckin' go and talk,
all right?

1125
01:00:08,403 --> 01:00:09,802
Just not right here.

1126
01:00:09,904 --> 01:00:11,303
- No.
- Fuck.

1127
01:00:11,406 --> 01:00:12,395
You know what?

1128
01:00:12,507 --> 01:00:14,532
You come see me when
you're ready to talk commitment.

1129
01:00:14,642 --> 01:00:15,631
Commitment.

1130
01:00:15,743 --> 01:00:17,404
Until then, just don't
talk to me at all.

1131
01:00:19,481 --> 01:00:22,075
Come on, baby, what,
I'll marry you.

1132
01:00:22,183 --> 01:00:23,172
Yeah, I bet you would.

1133
01:00:23,284 --> 01:00:24,444
Yeah, I will.

1134
01:00:24,552 --> 01:00:26,782
Come on, we'll have
beautiful children.

1135
01:00:26,888 --> 01:00:27,877
Fuck off!

1136
01:00:47,609 --> 01:00:48,769
You can — you can have those.

1137
01:00:48,877 --> 01:00:52,278
I printed 'em out for you.

1138
01:01:03,024 --> 01:01:05,083
You're late.

1139
01:01:14,836 --> 01:01:17,134
Oh, Mike.

1140
01:01:17,238 --> 01:01:19,263
I need to lock up.

1141
01:01:33,054 --> 01:01:34,282
- Hey.
- What?

1142
01:01:34,389 --> 01:01:35,913
- Look at me.
- What?

1143
01:01:37,592 --> 01:01:39,116
Turn it off.

1144
01:01:39,227 --> 01:01:41,354
I've almost finished
my presentation.

1145
01:01:41,462 --> 01:01:44,454
Can I see it?

1146
01:01:44,566 --> 01:01:46,261
- No.
- Why?

1147
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:47,800
Nah.

1148
01:01:47,902 --> 01:01:48,926
Why?

1149
01:01:49,037 --> 01:01:50,231
I don't want
to show it to you.

1150
01:01:50,338 --> 01:01:52,033
You got to see it
with everybody else.

1151
01:01:52,140 --> 01:01:53,129
With everybody else?

1152
01:01:53,241 --> 01:01:54,640
I'm not like everybody else.

1153
01:01:54,742 --> 01:01:55,731
I'm sleeping with you.

1154
01:01:55,843 --> 01:01:56,935
No, that's not gonna work.

1155
01:01:57,045 --> 01:01:58,774
- Come on, show me.
- No.

1156
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:00,211
Show me.

1157
01:02:00,315 --> 01:02:01,873
Show me.

1158
01:02:04,252 --> 01:02:06,015
You left your flash drive
on the nightstand.

1159
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:07,109
I'm gonna show myself.

1160
01:02:07,221 --> 01:02:08,916
Oh, no, no.

1161
01:02:09,023 --> 01:02:10,320
No.

1162
01:02:10,425 --> 01:02:11,722
Come here.

1163
01:02:11,826 --> 01:02:13,350
Come here, you.

1164
01:02:13,461 --> 01:02:14,860
Hey.

1165
01:02:14,963 --> 01:02:15,952
What?

1166
01:02:16,064 --> 01:02:17,292
What are you gonna
do to me, huh?

1167
01:02:17,398 --> 01:02:18,387
I'm not scared of you.

1168
01:02:18,499 --> 01:02:20,558
Give it to me.

1169
01:02:20,668 --> 01:02:22,795
I'm not scared of you.

1170
01:02:26,274 --> 01:02:28,139
I'm not anymore.

1171
01:02:31,913 --> 01:02:33,005
Poor old Danny.

1172
01:02:33,114 --> 01:02:34,638
Yeah, that dopey fuck.

1173
01:02:34,749 --> 01:02:36,011
He's got his jaw in a vice.

1174
01:02:36,117 --> 01:02:38,108
Six weeks before he can eat.

1175
01:02:38,219 --> 01:02:39,311
It's like I said,

1176
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:40,853
that little triangle's
more powerful ...

1177
01:02:40,955 --> 01:02:42,047
than a freakin' load of tanks.

1178
01:02:42,156 --> 01:02:43,145
True.

1179
01:02:43,257 --> 01:02:45,418
- Am I right?
- Yeah.

1180
01:02:45,526 --> 01:02:47,653
Armies have gone to war.

1181
01:02:47,762 --> 01:02:49,423
Kings have lost their thrones.

1182
01:02:49,530 --> 01:02:51,896
Listen to your father, Mike.

1183
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,262
He speaks from experience.

1184
01:02:53,368 --> 01:02:55,768
You know, your mother,
God rest her soul,

1185
01:02:55,870 --> 01:02:57,428
she was the prettiest girl
in Bay Ridge.

1186
01:02:57,538 --> 01:03:00,769
I mean, we were both
nuts about her.

1187
01:03:00,875 --> 01:03:04,311
But we make choices in life,
right, Vin?

1188
01:03:10,351 --> 01:03:11,340
$50.

1189
01:03:15,523 --> 01:03:17,354
I fold.

1190
01:03:22,096 --> 01:03:23,085
$100.

1191
01:03:23,197 --> 01:03:24,391
Oh.

1192
01:03:31,739 --> 01:03:32,728
I'm out.

1193
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:34,330
Yeah, that's
a fuckin' surprise.

1194
01:03:39,580 --> 01:03:40,569
Take it down.

1195
01:03:42,583 --> 01:03:45,780
Lou, go get that good bottle
of scotch I got you.

1196
01:03:45,887 --> 01:03:47,320
Mike, get it from the back,
will you?

1197
01:03:47,422 --> 01:03:48,821
It's by the bar.

1198
01:03:48,923 --> 01:03:51,255
Yeah, sure.

1199
01:03:51,359 --> 01:03:53,884
All right.

1200
01:03:55,430 --> 01:03:56,419
Kid's a fuckin' card shark.

1201
01:03:56,531 --> 01:03:57,520
I don't know.

1202
01:03:57,632 --> 01:03:58,758
Edward, do me a favor?

1203
01:03:58,866 --> 01:04:00,265
Go get us a couple
of meatball subs.

1204
01:04:00,368 --> 01:04:01,357
It's gonna be a late night.

1205
01:04:01,469 --> 01:04:02,834
I'm fuckin' starving.

1206
01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:06,563
Counting your money?
You're gonna lose it all.

1207
01:04:06,674 --> 01:04:08,369
It's all gonna be gone
by the end of the night.

1208
01:04:08,476 --> 01:04:10,171
What do you care?

1209
01:04:10,278 --> 01:04:12,041
Oh, Nicky,
you're not on tonight.

1210
01:04:12,747 --> 01:04:14,806
Why don't you go work on
that wreck of yours?

1211
01:04:14,916 --> 01:04:16,941
I got other things
to worry about tonight, Lou.

1212
01:04:17,051 --> 01:04:19,110
Now, how do you like it with
a fuckin' gun in your face?

1213
01:04:19,220 --> 01:04:20,414
Isn't this what you
do to people?

1214
01:04:20,521 --> 01:04:21,545
Nick, calm down.
It's crazy.

1215
01:04:21,656 --> 01:04:23,783
You're fuckin' killing
my neighborhood.

1216
01:04:23,891 --> 01:04:25,791
I'm gonna fuckin' kill you.

1217
01:04:25,893 --> 01:04:27,884
I'm gonna fuck — 
I'm gonna fuckin' kill you.

1218
01:04:31,365 --> 01:04:32,354
Mike?

1219
01:04:32,467 --> 01:04:33,456
What are you doing here?

1220
01:04:33,568 --> 01:04:34,557
Nick?

1221
01:04:34,669 --> 01:04:36,193
Nick, what are you doing?

1222
01:04:36,304 --> 01:04:38,465
Someone want to tell me
what the fuck this is all about?

1223
01:04:38,573 --> 01:04:39,562
I almost fuckin' died,

1224
01:04:39,674 --> 01:04:41,471
and you're killing
my fuckin' neighborhood,

1225
01:04:41,576 --> 01:04:42,770
and I'm gonna fuckin' kill you.

1226
01:04:42,877 --> 01:04:43,866
No, no, no, no!

1227
01:04:43,978 --> 01:04:45,946
Get a beer or something,
come on!

1228
01:04:47,148 --> 01:04:49,173
Sit, sit!

1229
01:04:53,287 --> 01:04:55,278
What the fuck?

1230
01:04:57,792 --> 01:04:58,781
What are you gonna do?

1231
01:05:04,832 --> 01:05:05,821
You come into my joint?

1232
01:05:05,933 --> 01:05:06,922
You point a gun at me?

1233
01:05:07,034 --> 01:05:08,126
You out of your fuckin' mind?

1234
01:05:11,572 --> 01:05:12,834
Give me your watch.

1235
01:05:12,940 --> 01:05:13,929
What?

1236
01:05:14,041 --> 01:05:15,133
Give me your fuckin' watch.

1237
01:05:15,243 --> 01:05:16,232
Jesus.

1238
01:05:16,344 --> 01:05:17,675
You got be kidding me, Nicky.

1239
01:05:17,779 --> 01:05:18,768
Jesus.

1240
01:05:24,452 --> 01:05:25,749
You better take
all that money,

1241
01:05:25,853 --> 01:05:27,878
'cause you just bought yourself
a world of hurt, son.

1242
01:05:27,989 --> 01:05:28,978
Shut the fuck up!

1243
01:05:31,359 --> 01:05:32,986
Nick.

1244
01:05:33,094 --> 01:05:34,322
Put it back.

1245
01:05:34,428 --> 01:05:37,192
Give it back.

1246
01:05:37,298 --> 01:05:39,061
Nick.

1247
01:05:39,167 --> 01:05:40,191
Nicky.

1248
01:05:43,204 --> 01:05:44,398
Come on.

1249
01:05:49,177 --> 01:05:51,543
So now you're in it.

1250
01:05:51,646 --> 01:05:54,342
Tough guys, huh?

1251
01:05:54,448 --> 01:05:56,882
Do it.

1252
01:05:58,719 --> 01:06:00,311
Do it.

1253
01:06:00,421 --> 01:06:01,410
Please, Mike.

1254
01:06:01,522 --> 01:06:02,511
Come on.

1255
01:06:02,623 --> 01:06:03,954
Don't make me do this.

1256
01:06:04,058 --> 01:06:05,650
I want it to be you, Mike.

1257
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:07,853
Do it.

1258
01:06:07,962 --> 01:06:09,896
Make your fuckin' balls, Mike.

1259
01:06:32,019 --> 01:06:33,919
That's your fuckin'
employee of the month?

1260
01:06:41,429 --> 01:06:42,726
Is he here yet?

1261
01:06:45,833 --> 01:06:46,959
Can I come in?

1262
01:07:01,582 --> 01:07:04,449
Do you want something
to drink?

1263
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:07,617
No, thanks.

1264
01:07:12,894 --> 01:07:15,419
Hey, he'll be back.

1265
01:07:41,889 --> 01:07:43,754
They're great.

1266
01:08:04,645 --> 01:08:05,942
I got to go.
Sorry.

1267
01:08:06,047 --> 01:08:07,378
Are you okay?
What's the matter?

1268
01:08:07,481 --> 01:08:08,539
I'll see you tonight.

1269
01:08:08,649 --> 01:08:10,947
Thank you.
Lights.

1270
01:08:11,052 --> 01:08:12,383
Manadoro, where are you going?

1271
01:08:12,486 --> 01:08:14,078
Are my critiques so terrifying?

1272
01:08:14,188 --> 01:08:15,246
Sorry, I got to go.

1273
01:08:15,356 --> 01:08:17,051
Mike, this is it,

1274
01:08:17,158 --> 01:08:18,819
your grades for the whole class.

1275
01:08:22,296 --> 01:08:23,524
I'm sorry.
It's an emergency.

1276
01:08:47,855 --> 01:08:49,550
Professor, I'm supposed
to see Mike tonight ...

1277
01:08:49,657 --> 01:08:51,386
if you want me
to give that to him.

1278
01:09:19,820 --> 01:09:21,185
Joey.

1279
01:09:21,288 --> 01:09:23,017
Go round to 14th.

1280
01:09:23,124 --> 01:09:25,115
Keep your eyes open.

1281
01:09:35,169 --> 01:09:36,466
Nicky?

1282
01:09:36,570 --> 01:09:38,037
Nicky?

1283
01:09:38,139 --> 01:09:39,731
Hey, whoa, where the fuck
are you going?

1284
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:41,467
You stay right here.

1285
01:09:41,575 --> 01:09:42,564
Hey, Nicky!

1286
01:09:42,676 --> 01:09:44,667
Just shut the fuck up
and stay right where you are.

1287
01:09:44,779 --> 01:09:47,077
Don't fuckin' move.

1288
01:09:48,949 --> 01:09:50,246
What's he gonna do to him,
Lou?

1289
01:09:51,652 --> 01:09:53,142
Lou, you can stop this thing.

1290
01:09:53,254 --> 01:09:55,620
I told you from the beginning,
I didn't want no war hero.

1291
01:09:57,291 --> 01:09:59,122
You know, he was
in Afghanistan too,

1292
01:09:59,226 --> 01:10:00,386
back when it was the Russians.

1293
01:10:12,573 --> 01:10:13,801
Nick!

1294
01:10:13,908 --> 01:10:16,433
Nicky.

1295
01:10:16,544 --> 01:10:17,568
What the fuck did you do?

1296
01:10:22,450 --> 01:10:24,145
You motherfucker!

1297
01:10:24,251 --> 01:10:25,684
What the fuck did you do?

1298
01:10:25,786 --> 01:10:26,775
Oh, shit.

1299
01:10:26,887 --> 01:10:27,876
Mike?

1300
01:10:29,090 --> 01:10:30,079
Nicky.

1301
01:10:31,725 --> 01:10:32,953
Mike.

1302
01:10:33,060 --> 01:10:37,463
Ow.

1303
01:10:37,565 --> 01:10:39,055
Nicky.

1304
01:10:43,871 --> 01:10:45,964
I swear to God,
I'll fucking kill you!

1305
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:55,678
Mike, help me go.

1306
01:12:58,839 --> 01:13:01,137
Act of God, act of man.

1307
01:13:01,242 --> 01:13:02,470
What's the fuckin' difference?

1308
01:13:06,513 --> 01:13:10,279
Your mother is as dead
as Nicky Shades, you know.

1309
01:13:12,086 --> 01:13:15,749
I wish I had someone like Tony
to blame.

1310
01:13:25,699 --> 01:13:28,600
I should've brought the wig
to the hospital that day.

1311
01:13:35,409 --> 01:13:37,172
The look on her face.

1312
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:42,810
She was so fuckin' disappointed,
you know?

1313
01:13:44,785 --> 01:13:48,221
Well, it had such
beautiful red hair.

1314
01:13:48,322 --> 01:13:50,153
It was hard for her to lose it.

1315
01:13:53,060 --> 01:13:54,288
But you were 16.

1316
01:13:54,395 --> 01:13:56,192
16, you're on a subway,

1317
01:13:56,297 --> 01:13:59,960
holding a red wig
on a Styrofoam head,

1318
01:14:00,067 --> 01:14:01,898
it's embarrassing, I know.

1319
01:14:02,002 --> 01:14:03,799
I get that.

1320
01:14:09,143 --> 01:14:11,236
I get that.

1321
01:14:16,750 --> 01:14:18,513
Vinny, I — I got the car ready
when you —

1322
01:14:18,619 --> 01:14:19,779
Yeah, yeah.

1323
01:14:19,887 --> 01:14:21,650
H — Hey, what — what's up, Mike?

1324
01:14:25,159 --> 01:14:27,559
You're a stone — cold prick
to these guys now.

1325
01:14:29,363 --> 01:14:31,263
Remember that you've got that
going for you.

1326
01:14:50,617 --> 01:14:53,347
Sal, Jimmy,
go get us some coffees.

1327
01:15:00,828 --> 01:15:05,288
Listen, sometimes my brother
can be fuckin' careless.

1328
01:15:05,399 --> 01:15:07,629
I didn't intend for him
to involve you in this.

1329
01:15:08,902 --> 01:15:10,529
I know that you and Shades
were tight.

1330
01:15:10,637 --> 01:15:12,832
But you knew it had to happen.

1331
01:15:12,940 --> 01:15:14,532
It's nice to see a kid
from the neighborhood ...

1332
01:15:14,641 --> 01:15:17,542
who understands and respects
the old codes and values.

1333
01:15:17,644 --> 01:15:19,578
Now, today was supposed to be
your last Oyster Bay run,

1334
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:21,875
but by way of thanks,

1335
01:15:21,982 --> 01:15:25,042
I'm giving you
the job permanent.

1336
01:16:03,357 --> 01:16:05,484
Holy shit!

1337
01:16:07,261 --> 01:16:08,387
It's not worth it.

1338
01:16:08,495 --> 01:16:09,484
Let it go, bro.

1339
01:16:09,596 --> 01:16:12,429
Let it go.

1340
01:16:27,581 --> 01:16:28,570
Oh, Mikey.

1341
01:16:28,682 --> 01:16:29,671
Thank God.

1342
01:16:29,783 --> 01:16:31,546
Can you help me, darling,
with this garbage?

1343
01:16:31,652 --> 01:16:33,415
It's so heavy.
- Sorry, I can't, Miss Gattei.

1344
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:34,680
40 years I'm your neighbor,

1345
01:16:34,788 --> 01:16:39,054
you can't help me
with a little garbage?

1346
01:16:39,159 --> 01:16:40,387
There.

1347
01:16:40,494 --> 01:16:42,553
God bless you.

1348
01:17:05,452 --> 01:17:06,942
Pop.

1349
01:17:24,705 --> 01:17:26,570
I'm so glad you're here.

1350
01:17:42,456 --> 01:17:43,889
You okay, son?

1351
01:17:50,964 --> 01:17:53,797
They jacked —
they jacked my car.

1352
01:17:55,903 --> 01:17:59,805
What happened to the bag?

1353
01:17:59,907 --> 01:18:01,841
I think they took it.

1354
01:18:01,942 --> 01:18:02,966
They took it.

1355
01:18:05,712 --> 01:18:06,701
Oh, Jesus.

1356
01:18:13,220 --> 01:18:17,247
Hey, it's Mike.
Leave me a message.

1357
01:18:17,357 --> 01:18:19,848
Hey, it's me again.

1358
01:18:19,960 --> 01:18:21,359
I just haven't
heard back from you,

1359
01:18:21,461 --> 01:18:23,452
and I'm getting
kind of freaked out,

1360
01:18:23,564 --> 01:18:25,555
so give me a call.

1361
01:19:01,735 --> 01:19:04,465
Listen to me.

1362
01:19:04,571 --> 01:19:06,436
We got to talk ...

1363
01:19:06,540 --> 01:19:07,529
before we go downstairs.

1364
01:19:30,163 --> 01:19:31,152
Can I help you?

1365
01:19:31,264 --> 01:19:32,356
Yeah, I'm looking for Mike.

1366
01:19:32,466 --> 01:19:34,900
He's not here right now,
but he'll be back in a while.

1367
01:19:35,002 --> 01:19:36,469
He just hasn't
been coming to class.

1368
01:19:36,570 --> 01:19:37,832
I'll tell him
that you came by.

1369
01:19:37,938 --> 01:19:39,200
Let her in.

1370
01:19:40,374 --> 01:19:41,363
Yeah, let her in.

1371
01:19:41,475 --> 01:19:43,807
Do it.

1372
01:19:53,787 --> 01:19:55,448
Oh, Kathy.

1373
01:19:55,555 --> 01:19:57,182
Shit.
Where have you been?

1374
01:19:57,290 --> 01:19:58,780
Kathy, come here.

1375
01:19:58,892 --> 01:20:00,553
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1376
01:20:00,661 --> 01:20:02,390
You okay?

1377
01:20:02,496 --> 01:20:03,554
Come here.

1378
01:20:03,664 --> 01:20:04,653
Come here.

1379
01:20:04,765 --> 01:20:08,428
Hey.

1380
01:20:08,535 --> 01:20:09,524
Talk to me.

1381
01:20:09,636 --> 01:20:10,625
Fuck, I missed you.

1382
01:20:10,737 --> 01:20:12,796
Mike, we got to get going.

1383
01:20:12,906 --> 01:20:14,396
- You okay?
- Yeah, let's get out of here.

1384
01:20:14,508 --> 01:20:15,702
Mike, we got to talk, huh?

1385
01:20:15,809 --> 01:20:17,037
Okay.

1386
01:20:18,245 --> 01:20:19,234
Hey, we got to get going.

1387
01:20:19,346 --> 01:20:22,144
I'm gonna be back
in a few hours.

1388
01:20:22,249 --> 01:20:23,238
The fuck you will.

1389
01:20:23,350 --> 01:20:24,578
You're coming with me
to see Tony.

1390
01:20:24,685 --> 01:20:25,674
No, the fuck you will.

1391
01:20:25,786 --> 01:20:26,775
Sit the fuck down.

1392
01:20:26,887 --> 01:20:27,876
Sit down!

1393
01:20:27,988 --> 01:20:29,319
Sit the fuck down!
- You let go of me!

1394
01:20:29,423 --> 01:20:32,324
Sit down!

1395
01:20:32,426 --> 01:20:33,654
You let go of me.

1396
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:36,888
Let me go.

1397
01:20:55,315 --> 01:20:56,612
I'm taking you
to the hospital.

1398
01:20:56,717 --> 01:20:57,706
Fuck.

1399
01:20:57,818 --> 01:20:59,149
No, no, let's just
get out of here.

1400
01:20:59,252 --> 01:21:00,549
- Are you kidding?
- No, let's go.

1401
01:21:00,654 --> 01:21:01,643
Come on, you're not okay.

1402
01:21:01,755 --> 01:21:04,747
Oh, shit.

1403
01:21:04,858 --> 01:21:06,416
How's the leg?

1404
01:21:06,526 --> 01:21:09,290
Where you two going?
- Mike.

1405
01:21:09,396 --> 01:21:10,920
They're not going anywhere.

1406
01:21:15,202 --> 01:21:16,191
I'm calling the cops.

1407
01:21:16,303 --> 01:21:17,770
- No, no, no.
- Hey, hey, hey.

1408
01:21:17,871 --> 01:21:19,202
Easy, easy.

1409
01:21:21,308 --> 01:21:22,605
Who the fuck is this, Mike?

1410
01:21:24,311 --> 01:21:26,472
She's nobody.

1411
01:21:26,580 --> 01:21:27,979
You got to get her out of here.

1412
01:21:28,081 --> 01:21:29,070
Hey, shut the fuck up.

1413
01:21:29,182 --> 01:21:30,513
Nobody is fuckin' leaving.

1414
01:21:30,617 --> 01:21:31,982
You understand me?

1415
01:21:32,085 --> 01:21:33,211
Mike.

1416
01:21:36,056 --> 01:21:37,045
Here.

1417
01:21:37,157 --> 01:21:38,624
Here, check her coat.

1418
01:21:38,725 --> 01:21:40,454
There's nothing in it.

1419
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:42,653
Check it.

1420
01:21:42,763 --> 01:21:43,991
Look.

1421
01:21:44,998 --> 01:21:47,990
Lou, let her go.

1422
01:21:48,101 --> 01:21:51,070
It's okay.

1423
01:21:51,171 --> 01:21:52,832
You know Gina Abruzzi.

1424
01:21:52,939 --> 01:21:54,998
Yeah, I know Gina Abruzzi.

1425
01:21:55,108 --> 01:21:57,542
Gina and Mike,
they're getting married.

1426
01:21:57,644 --> 01:21:58,633
Gina's his girl.

1427
01:21:58,745 --> 01:21:59,837
This girl is shit to him.

1428
01:21:59,946 --> 01:22:02,312
Look at her, she's a WASP.

1429
01:22:02,415 --> 01:22:04,007
You think I'd let my son
marry a WASP?

1430
01:22:04,117 --> 01:22:06,108
It's not gonna happen.

1431
01:22:09,923 --> 01:22:10,912
Is it true?

1432
01:22:17,664 --> 01:22:19,291
Just get her out of here.

1433
01:22:26,773 --> 01:22:27,865
Get out of here.

1434
01:22:35,982 --> 01:22:37,108
You're getting married.

1435
01:22:42,222 --> 01:22:43,484
Ow.

1436
01:22:54,401 --> 01:22:56,369
You know,
this Oyster Bay route's become ...

1437
01:22:56,469 --> 01:22:58,630
a big fuckin' pain
in the balls for me.

1438
01:22:58,738 --> 01:23:00,729
First you don't
get along with my brother.

1439
01:23:00,841 --> 01:23:02,274
Then Mike here gets jumped.

1440
01:23:02,375 --> 01:23:04,036
So he says.

1441
01:23:04,144 --> 01:23:06,203
Yeah, that's what he said.

1442
01:23:08,248 --> 01:23:09,738
Mike, I want you
to tell me what happened.

1443
01:23:09,850 --> 01:23:10,942
Don't worry about anything.

1444
01:23:11,051 --> 01:23:12,279
You're just here
to be debriefed,

1445
01:23:12,385 --> 01:23:14,512
you know,
like a fuckin' astronaut.

1446
01:23:16,756 --> 01:23:19,122
So I drive to Oyster Bay
like I do every week,

1447
01:23:19,226 --> 01:23:20,750
go pick up the bag.

1448
01:23:20,861 --> 01:23:23,489
And this little fuckin' guy
answers the door.

1449
01:23:23,597 --> 01:23:25,064
Hey, is Todd here?

1450
01:23:25,165 --> 01:23:26,723
Some guy I never seen before.

1451
01:23:26,833 --> 01:23:28,596
And he's acting
all weird like he's — 

1452
01:23:28,702 --> 01:23:30,567
like he's fuckin' deaf
or something.

1453
01:23:30,670 --> 01:23:31,659
Hey.

1454
01:23:31,771 --> 01:23:35,104
And then Todd shows up and ...

1455
01:23:35,208 --> 01:23:36,334
Thank you, Don.

1456
01:23:36,443 --> 01:23:37,967
tells the little guy
to give me the bag,

1457
01:23:38,078 --> 01:23:39,067
and I leave.

1458
01:23:39,179 --> 01:23:42,637
- Your package.
- Awesome.

1459
01:23:42,749 --> 01:23:44,683
But everything's a little weird,
you know?

1460
01:23:44,784 --> 01:23:48,743
And I'm on my way back.

1461
01:23:48,855 --> 01:23:49,844
I'm at a stoplight.

1462
01:23:49,956 --> 01:23:53,619
And this big SUV
pulls up behind me,

1463
01:23:53,727 --> 01:23:56,218
And these two
black guys get out.

1464
01:23:56,329 --> 01:23:58,229
They come up alongside my car.

1465
01:23:58,331 --> 01:24:01,459
Next thing you know,
I got a fuckin' gun in my face.

1466
01:24:01,568 --> 01:24:04,731
And I could see it
in his eyes right away.

1467
01:24:04,838 --> 01:24:05,827
Let it go.

1468
01:24:05,939 --> 01:24:06,928
He saw I was in drive.

1469
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:08,029
I knew I was dead,

1470
01:24:08,141 --> 01:24:09,369
because he knew if
I hit the gas,

1471
01:24:09,476 --> 01:24:11,205
I'd run into the getaway car.

1472
01:24:11,311 --> 01:24:12,801
Meanwhile, that's what I did ...

1473
01:24:14,014 --> 01:24:16,642
And the other guy,
he scooped up the bag.

1474
01:24:16,750 --> 01:24:20,015
Then you went straight home.

1475
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:22,020
Yeah.

1476
01:24:22,122 --> 01:24:25,387
You drove all that way
with a bullet in your leg?

1477
01:24:25,492 --> 01:24:29,019
Yeah.

1478
01:24:29,129 --> 01:24:31,620
I mean, I was out of it.

1479
01:24:31,731 --> 01:24:33,722
I — I stumbled up the stairs,

1480
01:24:33,833 --> 01:24:36,893
and I — I passed out
on the kitchen floor.

1481
01:24:37,003 --> 01:24:39,130
That's where I found him.

1482
01:24:43,310 --> 01:24:44,436
Anybody see you?

1483
01:24:46,479 --> 01:24:49,175
No.

1484
01:24:49,282 --> 01:24:51,682
You sure?

1485
01:24:51,785 --> 01:24:53,776
'Cause Mrs. Gattei said
you took out her trash.

1486
01:24:59,793 --> 01:25:03,194
I did see Miss Gattei, and —

1487
01:25:03,296 --> 01:25:04,854
'Cause see, the thing is,

1488
01:25:04,965 --> 01:25:07,433
Mrs. Gattei said
she didn't see any bullet hole.

1489
01:25:07,534 --> 01:25:08,728
Exactly, I was hiding it.

1490
01:25:08,835 --> 01:25:10,393
She doesn't see shit.

1491
01:25:10,503 --> 01:25:11,629
Tony.

1492
01:25:11,738 --> 01:25:14,764
Vinny, there's nobody
here I can trust ...

1493
01:25:14,874 --> 01:25:15,863
except for my brother,

1494
01:25:15,976 --> 01:25:20,470
and Lou here thinks
you got the bag, Mike.

1495
01:25:20,580 --> 01:25:21,569
I mean, I don't know.

1496
01:25:21,681 --> 01:25:22,978
What, call it intuition, Lou?

1497
01:25:23,083 --> 01:25:25,313
Right.

1498
01:25:25,418 --> 01:25:26,783
I agree.

1499
01:25:26,886 --> 01:25:28,217
There's a fuckin' first.

1500
01:25:35,562 --> 01:25:39,430
I got to say, Mike, I mean,
I'm disappointed.

1501
01:25:39,532 --> 01:25:41,727
I mean, your story
is fuckin' thin.

1502
01:25:54,214 --> 01:25:56,705
Is that the new one?

1503
01:25:56,816 --> 01:25:58,909
Can I see it?

1504
01:26:04,024 --> 01:26:06,219
That's a nice phone.

1505
01:26:06,326 --> 01:26:07,418
My wife would like this.

1506
01:26:07,527 --> 01:26:08,585
It's got a good screen.

1507
01:26:15,635 --> 01:26:16,624
Who called?

1508
01:26:20,473 --> 01:26:21,462
I don't know.

1509
01:26:23,209 --> 01:26:24,972
You don't recognize
the number?

1510
01:26:28,548 --> 01:26:30,209
No.

1511
01:26:36,122 --> 01:26:37,214
Who fuckin' called you?

1512
01:26:38,425 --> 01:26:39,414
What the fuck's going on?

1513
01:26:39,526 --> 01:26:41,517
'Cause he called a lot,
ten times yesterday.

1514
01:26:41,628 --> 01:26:43,653
You don't know the number.

1515
01:26:43,763 --> 01:26:47,756
Who called you?

1516
01:26:47,867 --> 01:26:49,892
Huh?

1517
01:26:50,003 --> 01:26:50,992
Lou.

1518
01:26:51,104 --> 01:26:52,230
It was Lou's phone number.

1519
01:26:56,209 --> 01:26:57,198
What's the matter, Lou?

1520
01:26:57,310 --> 01:26:58,436
You looking for your phone?

1521
01:27:09,689 --> 01:27:11,919
It's right here.

1522
01:27:18,498 --> 01:27:20,864
Look, when all
this shit came down,

1523
01:27:20,967 --> 01:27:22,935
I called him a few times
to see what was going on.

1524
01:27:23,036 --> 01:27:24,025
That's all.

1525
01:27:24,137 --> 01:27:27,937
There's calls on there
from before Mike left Brooklyn.

1526
01:27:29,375 --> 01:27:31,343
I want you to know
it was not my idea.

1527
01:27:31,444 --> 01:27:33,036
Shut the fuck up!

1528
01:27:36,716 --> 01:27:40,675
Tone, you gonna believe
this piece of shit over me?

1529
01:27:40,787 --> 01:27:43,119
Come on, I'm your brother.

1530
01:27:43,223 --> 01:27:45,691
Yeah.

1531
01:27:45,792 --> 01:27:49,228
My own brother.

1532
01:27:49,329 --> 01:27:52,093
You remember what Daddy
used to say?

1533
01:27:52,198 --> 01:27:54,894
I'm too old a cat
to be fucked by a kitten.

1534
01:28:01,908 --> 01:28:04,069
Tone, come on, you can't
do this in front of everybody!

1535
01:28:04,177 --> 01:28:06,145
Tony, come on!
- Oh, shit.

1536
01:28:09,983 --> 01:28:10,972
Oh, my God.

1537
01:28:27,333 --> 01:28:28,322
Get ahold of yourself.

1538
01:28:28,434 --> 01:28:31,562
I'm not gonna fuckin' kill you.

1539
01:28:31,671 --> 01:28:33,935
Our business arrangement
is too valuable.

1540
01:28:38,211 --> 01:28:39,610
Mike, I'm sorry
you had to see that.

1541
01:28:44,884 --> 01:28:48,081
You're a stand-up guy.

1542
01:28:48,188 --> 01:28:50,748
Now I want you to tell me,
where's the bag?

1543
01:28:55,028 --> 01:28:56,723
Someplace safe.

1544
01:28:56,829 --> 01:28:58,490
All right, good.
I'm glad to hear that.

1545
01:28:58,598 --> 01:29:01,123
Wait, you lied to me?

1546
01:29:01,234 --> 01:29:05,967
l — I had to keep it
as an insurance policy.

1547
01:29:07,907 --> 01:29:11,638
Who the fuck was I gonna
give it to, Lou, huh?

1548
01:29:11,744 --> 01:29:13,439
Vin, your son is smart.

1549
01:29:13,546 --> 01:29:15,605
No.

1550
01:29:15,715 --> 01:29:18,650
And no offense,
but he's got ambition.

1551
01:29:21,955 --> 01:29:23,616
Tell your father
where he can find the bag.

1552
01:29:25,158 --> 01:29:27,490
It's in the boiler room,

1553
01:29:27,594 --> 01:29:30,324
behind the boiler,

1554
01:29:30,430 --> 01:29:32,625
where they used to
keep the coal,

1555
01:29:32,732 --> 01:29:34,666
that little black door.

1556
01:29:45,612 --> 01:29:48,672
This I don't forgive.

1557
01:29:48,781 --> 01:29:50,772
I don't.

1558
01:30:44,003 --> 01:30:44,992
Open it.

1559
01:30:46,539 --> 01:30:47,528
I don't have the key.

1560
01:30:47,640 --> 01:30:48,800
Your cutter has it.

1561
01:31:10,930 --> 01:31:12,591
Straw and rocks.

1562
01:31:12,699 --> 01:31:13,688
Where are the drugs?

1563
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:15,631
Diamonds.

1564
01:31:15,735 --> 01:31:18,295
You think I'd have your son
carry fuckin' drugs?

1565
01:31:18,404 --> 01:31:21,532
Thank God for that, Tone.

1566
01:31:30,683 --> 01:31:32,014
He deserves a cut.

1567
01:31:32,552 --> 01:31:34,383
Pop, no.

1568
01:31:35,388 --> 01:31:37,515
Don't worry.
Mike will be taken care of.

1569
01:31:37,623 --> 01:31:38,885
No.

1570
01:31:38,991 --> 01:31:40,424
No.

1571
01:31:40,526 --> 01:31:43,324
This kid ...

1572
01:31:43,429 --> 01:31:44,794
he took a bullet for these.

1573
01:31:44,897 --> 01:31:46,387
It's only fair he gets a cut.

1574
01:31:46,499 --> 01:31:47,693
I just lost my brother,

1575
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:50,234
so don't you fuckin' lecture me
about fuckin' fair!

1576
01:31:50,336 --> 01:31:51,667
I just lost my brother!

1577
01:31:51,771 --> 01:31:53,796
- Tony, it ain't right.
- Vinny!

1578
01:31:53,906 --> 01:31:56,306
Mike, get your fuckin' father
out of here.

1579
01:31:57,977 --> 01:31:59,376
Get him out of here.

1580
01:32:02,215 --> 01:32:03,204
- That ain't —
- Vinny!

1581
01:32:03,316 --> 01:32:05,216
Get your fuckin' hands
off of me!

1582
01:32:10,323 --> 01:32:11,756
Let's go.

1583
01:32:22,301 --> 01:32:24,166
He'll get over it.

1584
01:32:32,011 --> 01:32:33,774
Oh, shit.

1585
01:32:37,950 --> 01:32:38,939
Hey, Pop, I'm sorry.

1586
01:32:39,051 --> 01:32:42,646
I know this is really fucked up.

1587
01:32:42,755 --> 01:32:46,748
Hey, we're —
we're both limpin', huh?

1588
01:33:10,716 --> 01:33:11,705
What's wrong with you?

1589
01:33:11,818 --> 01:33:13,342
Gina and I broke up.

1590
01:33:13,453 --> 01:33:15,114
Well, don't be so gloomy, huh?

1591
01:33:15,221 --> 01:33:19,681
You never know what'll come
with the next roll of the dice.

1592
01:33:26,532 --> 01:33:28,056
That got your attention.

1593
01:33:28,167 --> 01:33:30,260
Put 'em the fuck —
where did you get those?

1594
01:33:30,369 --> 01:33:31,597
What the fuck did you do?

1595
01:33:31,704 --> 01:33:32,796
What do you mean what'd I do?

1596
01:33:32,905 --> 01:33:34,497
I knew you took the bag.

1597
01:33:34,607 --> 01:33:37,667
Come on,
you left a trail of blood ...

1598
01:33:37,777 --> 01:33:40,075
right to the boiler, Einstein.

1599
01:33:43,649 --> 01:33:46,379
I had to clean it up
before anyone saw.

1600
01:33:50,356 --> 01:33:51,983
I was thinking,

1601
01:33:52,091 --> 01:33:54,218
"What the fuck
were you doing down there? "

1602
01:34:02,368 --> 01:34:06,737
Now I got a bag in my hands,

1603
01:34:06,839 --> 01:34:09,933
a bag that you can get
at a hardware store.

1604
01:34:14,013 --> 01:34:17,141
When Todd didn't have the key,
I knew that we had it made,

1605
01:34:17,250 --> 01:34:19,047
because that meant
that he didn't have a chance ...

1606
01:34:19,151 --> 01:34:22,587
to count the diamonds.

1607
01:34:22,688 --> 01:34:25,156
If you had to pick a time
to lie to me,

1608
01:34:25,258 --> 01:34:26,953
this was a good one,

1609
01:34:27,059 --> 01:34:28,993
'cause now I finally had ...

1610
01:34:29,095 --> 01:34:31,757
a decent hand
to play against Tony.

1611
01:34:31,864 --> 01:34:33,092
Are you fuckin' crazy?

1612
01:34:33,199 --> 01:34:34,188
Relax.

1613
01:34:34,300 --> 01:34:35,494
You know who these people are.

1614
01:34:35,601 --> 01:34:37,865
The guy killed his own fuckin'
brother right in front of me.

1615
01:34:37,970 --> 01:34:38,959
Christ.

1616
01:34:39,071 --> 01:34:40,060
And then you,

1617
01:34:40,172 --> 01:34:41,935
you have the fuckin' balls
to ask him for one.

1618
01:34:42,041 --> 01:34:44,771
That was so nice.

1619
01:34:44,877 --> 01:34:47,038
I mean, come on.

1620
01:34:47,146 --> 01:34:50,206
What are you laughing about?

1621
01:34:50,316 --> 01:34:55,379
I was so proud of myself.

1622
01:34:55,488 --> 01:34:56,750
I — I loved it.

1623
01:34:56,856 --> 01:34:59,017
Oh, my God, I was like a king.

1624
01:34:59,125 --> 01:35:01,650
Look, if you're gonna
ask for it,

1625
01:35:01,761 --> 01:35:03,160
they know
you're not gonna take it.

1626
01:35:04,597 --> 01:35:07,157
And remember me,

1627
01:35:07,266 --> 01:35:11,362
I'm the guy
that has no ambition.

1628
01:35:11,470 --> 01:35:14,303
Fuckin' Tony.

1629
01:35:14,407 --> 01:35:18,673
The more he put me down,
the more he freed me.

1630
01:35:21,213 --> 01:35:24,910
Look at that.

1631
01:35:25,017 --> 01:35:26,985
So what are you
gonna do with 'em?

1632
01:35:27,086 --> 01:35:30,419
Question is ...

1633
01:35:30,523 --> 01:35:32,320
what are you gonna do with them?

1634
01:35:39,298 --> 01:35:42,961
You are gonna have to leave.

1635
01:35:45,037 --> 01:35:47,597
You can't stay working for Tony.

1636
01:35:47,707 --> 01:35:52,076
If you do,
your life will be a short one.

1637
01:35:52,178 --> 01:35:55,841
What about you?

1638
01:35:55,948 --> 01:35:57,245
Hmm?

1639
01:35:57,350 --> 01:36:01,616
Who the fuck's gonna
take care of you if I'm gone?

1640
01:36:10,529 --> 01:36:12,326
Don't push me,
'cause I got to warm up.

1641
01:36:17,036 --> 01:36:18,298
Huh?

1642
01:36:18,404 --> 01:36:20,372
Chuckie would be proud,
I'm telling you.

1643
01:36:20,473 --> 01:36:24,739
Put it up, put it up,
put it way up.

1644
01:36:24,844 --> 01:36:26,243
Oh, what?

1645
01:36:26,345 --> 01:36:30,008
Come on, I seen guys do it
all the time at — 

1646
01:36:30,116 --> 01:36:31,913
Look, you put a little grease ...

1647
01:36:32,018 --> 01:36:34,111
on the lift of the back
of the truck,

1648
01:36:34,220 --> 01:36:35,812
you're down, right?

1649
01:36:35,921 --> 01:36:38,913
Retired, you're in Miami at 50.

1650
01:36:40,092 --> 01:36:42,652
You're telling me for four —
for four years,

1651
01:36:42,762 --> 01:36:43,751
I drove you around,

1652
01:36:43,863 --> 01:36:44,921
and you're perfectly
fuckin' fine?

1653
01:36:45,031 --> 01:36:46,020
Yeah.

1654
01:36:46,132 --> 01:36:47,429
Why the fuck
didn't you tell me?

1655
01:36:47,533 --> 01:36:48,966
What am I gonna do,
tell everybody?

1656
01:36:49,068 --> 01:36:50,433
Come on,
there's rats everywhere.

1657
01:36:50,536 --> 01:36:51,525
Come on.

1658
01:36:51,637 --> 01:36:52,626
Told Chuckie, but — 

1659
01:36:52,738 --> 01:36:55,138
I'm your son
for Christ's sake.

1660
01:36:55,241 --> 01:36:57,505
I was ashamed at first,
you know.

1661
01:36:57,610 --> 01:37:00,545
What your mother would think.

1662
01:37:01,814 --> 01:37:06,148
But after she was gone ...

1663
01:37:06,252 --> 01:37:07,241
look, I couldn't — 

1664
01:37:07,353 --> 01:37:09,844
I couldn't work there
any longer.

1665
01:37:09,955 --> 01:37:11,752
If I would have worked there
for another hour,

1666
01:37:11,857 --> 01:37:13,757
I swear to God, I would have
blown my fuckin' brains out,

1667
01:37:13,859 --> 01:37:15,224
I'm telling you.

1668
01:37:19,231 --> 01:37:20,630
You know what's funny?

1669
01:37:20,733 --> 01:37:22,667
I've been faking it for so long,

1670
01:37:22,768 --> 01:37:25,134
it actually hurts
when I walk regular.

1671
01:37:30,543 --> 01:37:36,243
Officially, you and l,
we had a knock-down, drag-out.

1672
01:37:36,348 --> 01:37:37,440
You left.

1673
01:37:45,091 --> 01:37:47,616
Yeah, all right?

1674
01:37:50,629 --> 01:37:53,894
Yeah.

1675
01:37:53,999 --> 01:37:55,830
Gina said I'd never
leave the neighborhood.

1676
01:37:57,303 --> 01:37:58,292
Come here.

1677
01:38:05,077 --> 01:38:06,169
Look at that.

1678
01:38:12,118 --> 01:38:15,281
The neighborhood is leaving.

1679
01:38:29,435 --> 01:38:31,096
Thank you.

1680
01:38:35,274 --> 01:38:37,970
I'll be all right.

1681
01:39:15,581 --> 01:39:16,570
Kathy.

1682
01:39:16,682 --> 01:39:17,876
Kathy, wait a second.

1683
01:39:17,983 --> 01:39:21,180
Kathy, wait, wait.

1684
01:39:21,287 --> 01:39:22,720
I need to talk to you.

1685
01:39:22,822 --> 01:39:25,017
Glad to see
you're in one piece.

1686
01:39:25,124 --> 01:39:26,455
We talked.
I'm going to the airport.

1687
01:39:26,559 --> 01:39:27,651
Wait.

1688
01:39:29,061 --> 01:39:30,050
I want to go with you.

1689
01:39:30,162 --> 01:39:33,325
What?

1690
01:39:33,432 --> 01:39:34,899
I want to go
to Florence with you.

1691
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:36,991
Why don't you go
with your fiancée?

1692
01:39:37,102 --> 01:39:38,296
It's a good place to honeymoon.

1693
01:39:38,404 --> 01:39:41,737
Kathy, I had to do that
for your own protection, okay?

1694
01:39:41,841 --> 01:39:43,570
I had to say that
so they'd let you go.

1695
01:39:43,676 --> 01:39:44,802
I apologize.

1696
01:39:44,910 --> 01:39:46,969
I — yes, I had a girlfriend,
okay?

1697
01:39:47,079 --> 01:39:48,068
That's true.

1698
01:39:48,180 --> 01:39:50,478
We broke up.

1699
01:39:50,583 --> 01:39:52,073
Good for her.

1700
01:39:52,184 --> 01:39:55,415
- Kathy.
- What, Mike?

1701
01:39:55,521 --> 01:39:56,749
I'm sorry.

1702
01:39:56,856 --> 01:39:59,188
You're sorry for what?

1703
01:39:59,291 --> 01:40:00,849
For lying to me?

1704
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:03,292
For fucking me
behind your girlfriend's back?

1705
01:40:03,395 --> 01:40:05,090
Or are you just sorry
you weren't man enough ...

1706
01:40:05,197 --> 01:40:06,630
to tell me about her
in the first place?

1707
01:40:06,732 --> 01:40:08,359
What are you sorry for?

1708
01:40:12,705 --> 01:40:13,694
You know what?

1709
01:40:13,806 --> 01:40:15,831
Here.

1710
01:40:15,941 --> 01:40:17,169
Take this.

1711
01:40:17,276 --> 01:40:18,641
Now I don't have to ship it.

1712
01:40:20,646 --> 01:40:24,275
Are we done?
Can I go?

1713
01:40:35,261 --> 01:40:36,728
What are you gonna do now?

1714
01:40:44,203 --> 01:40:46,171
Right.

1715
01:40:46,272 --> 01:40:49,503
Well, Reyerson said
you should keep in touch, so ...

1716
01:40:51,911 --> 01:40:53,139
I want to take a picture
of you.

1717
01:40:58,784 --> 01:40:59,808
Let me.

1718
01:41:04,290 --> 01:41:06,918
I want you to look at me
and say, "Fuck off.

1719
01:41:07,026 --> 01:41:08,493
I don't love you."

1720
01:41:12,031 --> 01:41:13,020
Do it.

1721
01:41:13,132 --> 01:41:14,759
