1
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:34,631
<i>Everyone thinks Harlem
was the capital of jazz in the 1930s.</i>

2
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:40,334
<i>That all of New York flooded uptown
at night to party till dawn.</i>

3
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:44,443
<i>Nice story, but unfortunately,
it's just not true.</i>

4
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:48,741
<i>It was all happening in the little town
of Passaic, New Jersey.</i>

5
00:00:50,116 --> 00:00:52,448
<i>Passaic was the capital of jazz
in the '20s and '30s...</i>

6
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:55,053
<i>...because of its own native son...</i>

7
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:56,916
<i>...Thomas "Fats" Waller...</i>

8
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,752
<i>...one of the greatest entertainers
of all time.</i>

9
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:02,394
<i>Chapter 1, the birth of Fats Waller.</i>

10
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:06,862
<i>It all began right here,
a hundred years ago...</i>

11
00:01:07,033 --> 00:01:09,501
<i>...in Passaic, New Jersey.</i>

12
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:11,432
<i>Right here, on this block.</i>

13
00:01:11,604 --> 00:01:13,731
<i>It was a different neighborhood then,
but look here...</i>

14
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,568
<i>...he was born at 261 Main Street.</i>

15
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:18,575
<i>When he was young, he used to follow
his father around the streets...</i>

16
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:21,009
<i>...because his father
was a street minister.</i>

17
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:24,947
<i>He started playing piano, as I understand,
out in the streets here in Passaic...</i>

18
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:26,142
<i>...on a harmonium.</i>

19
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:29,777
<i>Poor boy put on pounds
faster than the price of aluminum.</i>

20
00:01:29,956 --> 00:01:33,119
<i>One-forty-seven.</i>

21
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:35,784
<i>Thomas, you're gonna break
Dr. Benton's scale.</i>

22
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:37,452
<i>You're getting worse.</i>

23
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:41,157
<i>Maybe that's why he would have to play
a very huge instrument.</i>

24
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:43,996
<i>So he would spend nights here,
at the great organ.</i>

25
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,764
<i>Fats used the church
as his training ground.</i>

26
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,842
<i>And soon, all of Passaic
would know his name.</i>

27
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:53,376
<i>Fats lived his life all in excess.</i>

28
00:01:53,546 --> 00:01:58,142
<i>Loads of music, loads of food
and loads of women.</i>

29
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:03,051
<i>Who would expect a simple influenza virus
would get him in his bed?</i>

30
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:04,952
<i>A sleeping-train bed, though.</i>

31
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:09,926
<i>But still, the train had been stopped
in the freezing cold winter...</i>

32
00:02:10,096 --> 00:02:12,690
<i>...in the train station in Kansas City.</i>

33
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:16,029
<i>Fats, are you okay? Fats? You okay?</i>

34
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:20,229
<i>Is there a doctor on the train?</i>

35
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:28,946
<i>Fats was the star
that made the whole town shine.</i>

36
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:41,693
Hey, Jerry, hand me Number 9.

37
00:02:43,429 --> 00:02:46,694
<i>I will give you</i>

38
00:02:46,866 --> 00:02:49,926
<i>- Okay. All right.
- Number 9</i>

39
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:51,993
<i>Handing you number</i>

40
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,106
<i>- Would you shut up?
- Number 9</i>

41
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:57,503
Could you just paint
and be quiet, please?

42
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:59,167
Knock it off.

43
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,505
<i>It's terrible.</i>

44
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,886
- What the duck, Jerry?
- What?

45
00:03:13,059 --> 00:03:15,357
I asked you to give me Number 9,
the nose.

46
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:16,722
<i>Yeah, that's what I did.</i>

47
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:19,831
<i>No, you didn't. This is Number 6.
This is the eye.</i>

48
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:23,264
All right, well, how am I supposed to tell
the difference between a six and a nine?

49
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:25,961
Because we did both the eyes already,
you doofus.

50
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:27,163
<i>Come on, get organized.</i>

51
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,604
I told you, put the finished ones
in a separate pile.

52
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:31,243
<i>Look, what's the difference, man?</i>

53
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:34,403
A nostril and an upside-down eye
are the same anyway. It looks fine.

54
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:38,483
Oh, is that supposed to be funny?
Are you trying to say Fats had big nostrils?

55
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:41,176
<i>- Jerry.
- Hi, officer, how's it going?</i>

56
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:44,517
<i>Look what happened. Last night,
some hoodlums came and did...</i>

57
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:46,625
<i>- Oh, really?
... all this stuff here, this...</i>

58
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:49,284
<i>- Here we go again.
- It's disgusting.</i>

59
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:52,397
- I hate graffiti.
- Yeah, they even left the ladder.

60
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:54,931
<i>That's, like, evidence.
We should confiscate it.</i>

61
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:57,467
- Catch them.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure.

62
00:03:57,637 --> 00:03:59,468
<i>You're getting on my nerves.</i>

63
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:02,836
<i>You keep this up,
you'll be spending the night in jail.</i>

64
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:05,000
- Okay.
- Moron.

65
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:07,373
<i>If... If they come back for the ladder,
we'll catch them.</i>

66
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:11,449
Hey, fellas, is that supposed to be
Biggie Smalls or something?

67
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:14,644
<i>No, man, that's that dead old blues guy,
Louis Armstrong.</i>

68
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:18,154
No, my ignorant little buddies,
this is Fats Waller.

69
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:20,224
<i>- Really?
- Famous jazz musician.</i>

70
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:23,851
He was born in my building
about a hundred years ago.

71
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:30,328
<i>- Ice cream, anyone?
- Oh, yeah.</i>

72
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:32,835
<i>That's what I'm talking about.</i>

73
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:36,506
<i>Mr. Fletcher, you know,
really, seriously...</i>

74
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:39,201
<i>...if you don't like the painting,
you can... You can tell me.</i>

75
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:43,281
<i>I know that there's something wrong
with the nose, I don't know if you noticed.</i>

76
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,979
What about the authorities, Mike?

77
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:48,882
The city already has issues
with the building as it is.

78
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:51,489
<i>Mr. Fletcher, you don't have
to worry about the police.</i>

79
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:54,627
- I worked my magic on them.
- Yeah, he did confuse them.

80
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,785
Okay, they think some gangsters did it.

81
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,988
- And you confused them?
- Yeah, with my finesse.

82
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:02,191
Yeah, I feel great. You sure
this is gonna bring us more customers?

83
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:05,565
<i>I hope so. I mean, anyway, don't you think
it's time the people around here...</i>

84
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:09,139
<i>...started to learn a bit little about, you
know, the history of their neighborhood?</i>

85
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,709
<i>I mean, people don't even know
who Fats is.</i>

86
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:14,574
<i>- It's a little embarrassing.
- Hey. Hey. That's not true.</i>

87
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:17,546
- We know who Fats Waller is.
- Is that right?

88
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:19,981
<i>Bet you can't sing a jazz song.</i>

89
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:23,054
- Oh, challenge.
- Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

90
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:25,950
<i>That's not jazz.</i>

91
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:27,183
<i>Fuzzy, oh, oh</i>

92
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,319
<i>Fuzzy wuzzy was a bear
Fuzzy jazzy had no hair</i>

93
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,829
<i>Fuzzy wuzzy wasn't fuzzy, was he?</i>

94
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,595
<i>Yes, he was, he was Fuzzy
Had a fuzzy face</i>

95
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:42,070
<i>Check this out and let me say
One thing to you</i>

96
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:44,709
<i>Watch me play my fuzzy bass</i>

97
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:50,039
Standup bass.

98
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:54,751
<i>I'm sorry, Mr. Fletcher.</i>

99
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:56,445
<i>It's all right, Jerry. I got it.</i>

100
00:05:56,622 --> 00:05:58,214
Actually, you gotta go back to work.

101
00:05:58,391 --> 00:06:00,723
Duty calls. You gotta
go back to the microwave.

102
00:06:00,893 --> 00:06:02,793
I think I saw one of your creations
just roll by.

103
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:05,055
<i>- Turn the microwave on high.
- You think it's a joke?</i>

104
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:07,756
<i>Let me tell you, you're gonna
be responsible for my brain tumor.</i>

105
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:10,129
- All of you guys are.
- Where the hell is Jerry?

106
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:11,531
<i>Man, what's her problem?</i>

107
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:14,036
<i>She said she wanted a sporty car,
now she's freaking out.</i>

108
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,299
You did that?

109
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:21,806
<i>- I don't want this.
- Don't forget your salad bowl.</i>

110
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:24,176
<i>I told you she wouldn't be
into them big pipes.</i>

111
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,079
<i>Polish or not, she's still a girl.</i>

112
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:28,618
<i>Come on, Wilson.
She couldn't get the doors open.</i>

113
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:31,222
Well, she could have went through
the window.

114
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:34,086
These damn helmets.

115
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,888
<i>I don't think they're helping
with the microwaves at all.</i>

116
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,394
<i>Oh, you'll thank me.</i>

117
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:41,499
<i>- All right, I'll see you in the morning.
- All right, thanks.</i>

118
00:06:57,483 --> 00:06:59,917
<i>Good night, Mike.
Don't forget to turn out the lights.</i>

119
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,951
Good night, Mr. Fletcher.

120
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,499
<i>A rent party was the place to be
in the '20s and '30s.</i>

121
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:20,696
They were jumping.

122
00:07:20,873 --> 00:07:22,932
<i>If you didn't have enough money
to cover your rent...</i>

123
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:27,307
<i>...you'd invite a few musicians,
charge for drinks, and you'd get it on.</i>

124
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,948
Everybody would throw
just a little bit in the pot.

125
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,981
<i>A dollar, whatever they could spare.</i>

126
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:34,585
<i>Jerry doesn't believe you've ever been
to a rent party, Mr. Fletcher.</i>

127
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:36,779
What are you talking about?
I never said that.

128
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:38,287
Oh, man, I used to go to all of them.

129
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,619
<i>That's where I'd meet
all the girls on Saturday night.</i>

130
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:43,353
<i>I can't imagine you with a girl,
Mr. Fletcher.</i>

131
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:46,657
<i>Oh, nice, that's great. That's perfect.</i>

132
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,266
Yeah, what about you, Jerry?

133
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:51,961
<i>I don't see much action
coming out of your trailer at night.</i>

134
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:55,369
<i>When I was your age,
my balls were flapping so hard...</i>

135
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:58,305
<i>...I had to scrape them off the ground
and beg them to come home with me.</i>

136
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,878
- Come on, balls.
- Yeah, come on.

137
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:03,106
<i>Come on. That's hilarious.</i>

138
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:04,306
What about you, Mike?

139
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,418
When was the last time you heard
some action coming out of his room?

140
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:08,076
Why are you all worried about me for?

141
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:09,949
I heard some action sometime.

142
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:13,523
<i>Now, it's more like a trumpet solo.</i>

143
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:16,653
Trumpet solo.

144
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,763
Could you close your mouth
when you chew? Thanks.

145
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:20,660
How come you never got married,
Mr. Fletcher?

146
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:24,496
<i>Well, the common story is...</i>

147
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,901
<i>...the girl that you was gonna ask,
you waited too long to ask...</i>

148
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:30,406
<i>...and she went on
and married somebody else.</i>

149
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:33,670
<i>And then you can't find anybody
that compared to her.</i>

150
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:36,747
So, what happens? You get old.

151
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:48,817
<i>Obviously we're looking
at a real improvement in quality of life.</i>

152
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:50,963
<i>These brand-new condominiums
are gonna bring us...</i>

153
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,155
<i>...the fresh blood
that we need for our community...</i>

154
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:56,199
<i>...and transform this slum forever.</i>

155
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:59,702
<i>"Slum"? Hey, this is not a slum.</i>

156
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:03,899
<i>Hey, sure, the place needs a few repairs,
but I'm taking care of it.</i>

157
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:06,203
Look, look,
business is about to pick up.

158
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,607
I can feel it.

159
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,943
<i>I'm sorry, Mr. Fletcher,
but the building is condemned.</i>

160
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:14,883
It violates structural,
fire and plumbing standards.

161
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:17,818
<i>I don't see wheelchair access.</i>

162
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,753
Your video store is a tenement.

163
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:23,554
<i>You have 60 days from this notice
of demolition...</i>

164
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:26,698
<i>...to bring it up to code,
otherwise we will have to demolish it.</i>

165
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:28,857
<i>- But we will relocate you...
- Yes.</i>

166
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:31,936
<i>...to a property
of proportionate fair-market value.</i>

167
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:33,662
<i>Projects aren't so bad, you know.</i>

168
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,739
Move to the projects?

169
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:39,667
How am I gonna tell Mike?

170
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:43,941
<i>Look, I just wanna improve the life
of the people of Passaic, that's all.</i>

171
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:50,547
<i>You know, you don't have to pay me
this month, Mr. Fletcher. I'm okay.</i>

172
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:54,159
<i>Don't worry about the money, Mike.
I'll pay you soon.</i>

173
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:59,060
I n fact, I... I need for you
to take over for me.

174
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:01,290
<i>- You're retiring?
- Oh, no, no, no.</i>

175
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:04,231
<i>This year's the 60th anniversary
of Fats' death.</i>

176
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:07,861
<i>And there's a ceremony
that's being organized in commemoration.</i>

177
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,907
<i>We gonna all get together
in that abandoned train where he died...</i>

178
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:13,170
<i>...and we're gonna play his records
until morning.</i>

179
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:15,143
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah.

180
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:17,111
I wanna come. Can I come with you?

181
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,375
No.

182
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:20,485
I just told you,
I need you to take over for me.

183
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:24,612
<i>Oh, right, right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. Okay.</i>

184
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,020
<i>You want me to just run the shop
while you're gone?</i>

185
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:28,558
You think I could do that?

186
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:30,457
You tell me.

187
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,622
<i>I'm not gonna let you down,
Mr. Fletcher.</i>

188
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,827
<i>Good, just don't set the place on fire.</i>

189
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:38,994
Oh, no. Service, quality, safety,
you can count on that.

190
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:41,036
Excellent.

191
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:43,334
<i>Here's something really important:</i>

192
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:44,601
You must never...

193
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:46,745
Slam the door, because
the building will collapse.

194
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:50,905
<i>No, Mike. I mean, yes,
but that's not what I wanted to say.</i>

195
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:53,779
- You must never...
- Use the VCR to rewind the tapes...

196
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:56,319
No. Why do you always
have to finish my sentences?

197
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,650
<i>- Okay, just listen.
- Okay. I'm sorry. Go ahead.</i>

198
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:01,657
Okay, you must... Damn it.

199
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:04,695
Now I forgot what I had to say.

200
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:07,264
<i>- But it's very...
- Lock the door.</i>

201
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:09,962
<i>- Mr. Fletcher, have a good trip.
- I'll have a good trip.</i>

202
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:11,535
Take some pictures and call me.

203
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:13,228
Oh, yes, yes. L... I remember.

204
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:15,696
See, you wanted to finish my sentence.

205
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:19,333
<i>- I lost my focus. I can't...
- No, no. I was listening. I was listening.</i>

206
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,606
Hey, Mike. Mike. Keep Jerry...

207
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:25,046
<i>I can't hear you.</i>

208
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:28,610
Keep Jerry out. Out, out.

209
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:32,418
<i>What? I don't know what that means.</i>

210
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:35,185
<i>"Peek your edge too.
Peek your edge... "</i>

211
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:40,365
<i>"Tuo. Too. Peek your edge too. "</i>

212
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,364
<i>That's what it is.</i>

213
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:45,737
I just found out something sad today.

214
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,231
<i>Mr. Fletcher can't spell.</i>

215
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:53,643
<i>Maybe his parents
couldn't afford school.</i>

216
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:55,508
Did he have parents?

217
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:58,643
- Yeah.
- I nteresting.

218
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:01,150
<i>Don't mention this to anybody.</i>

219
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,721
<i>- Just keep this between us. Don't...
- Of course not, that would be racist.</i>

220
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:08,155
Peek your... Pick.

221
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:09,817
Your age. Pick your age.

222
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:12,019
<i>He's talking gibberish.</i>

223
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:14,826
<i>It's nonsense, but it's not his fault.</i>

224
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:19,031
<i>The power plant's controlling us.
I know it.</i>

225
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:21,139
- Through microwaves.
- Mm-hm.

226
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:24,071
<i>They're using it to make us do things.</i>

227
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,438
To buy things, to accept things.

228
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:28,978
<i>And who...? Who...? Who are they?
Who are "they"?</i>

229
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:31,981
The government, the FBI, of course.

230
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:34,745
- And I say no more.
- Right.

231
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,047
<i>I'm gonna sabotage
the power plant tonight...</i>

232
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:38,588
<i>...and you're gonna help me.</i>

233
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,318
Look, I got a map.
Completely worked out.

234
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:43,621
We short-circuit this
with whatever that thing is.

235
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:45,661
And that blows up the transformer.

236
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:47,492
<i>All we gotta do is climb the fence...</i>

237
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:51,500
<i>...and throw this sweet grappling hook
right into the transformer. Boom.</i>

238
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:53,266
You know what I mean?

239
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,031
Yeah.

240
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:57,607
This, my friend, is your camouflage.

241
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,074
Camouflage.

242
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:00,269
Bones.

243
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:01,811
We need that electricity.

244
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:05,144
You know, we got the machines, we...
And nobody rewinds the tapes.

245
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:07,251
- This is more important than that.
- You gotta rewind the tapes.

246
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:09,011
<i>That's the lamest excuse
I've ever heard.</i>

247
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:11,952
<i>It's totally non-sequitury,
what you're saying to me.</i>

248
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:13,955
<i>- It's a lame excuse?
- Yeah, it's lame.</i>

249
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:16,321
Really? And the power plant
is controlling us?

250
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:18,122
<i>That's not nonsense?
That's not paranoia?</i>

251
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,390
<i>Okay, it sounds crazy,
and you know why?</i>

252
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:22,966
<i>- Because it's affecting my brain too.
- Mm-hm.</i>

253
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,159
<i>It's paranizing it.</i>

254
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:27,271
Mr. Fletcher left me
in charge of the store.

255
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:30,237
Me. He trusted me with the store.
Do you know what that means?

256
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:33,378
<i>No, actually I don't.
Maybe you could explain it to me.</i>

257
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:35,138
<i>- It means that I'm not doing this.
- What?</i>

258
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,611
<i>- I'm not doing this with you.
- Okay.</i>

259
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:38,443
<i>So you'll just do anything
Mr. Fletcher says...</i>

260
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:40,551
<i>...even though, by the way,
he's not your real father.</i>

261
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:42,550
<i>- So... So what?
- And he's completely illiterate.</i>

262
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:44,018
<i>- He's not...
- But you won't do anything for me...</i>

263
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,919
<i>...your best friend,
who has a melting brain.</i>

264
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:49,527
<i>Can I...? Can I...? Can I help you
make a selection? Because if not...</i>

265
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:52,823
<i>...I'm gonna have to ask you
to make space for the other customers.</i>

266
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,425
<i>Oh, sorry, I didn't realize
it was rush hour.</i>

267
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:57,000
<i>I won't bother you anymore.</i>

268
00:13:57,169 --> 00:14:00,195
You know, it does get busy unexpectedly.

269
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:01,805
<i>And you know, he's not illiterate.</i>

270
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:04,772
<i>First of all, because if he was illiterate,
smart guy...</i>

271
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:06,468
<i>...he wouldn't be able to write:</i>

272
00:14:06,645 --> 00:14:08,476
<i>"Peek your edge too. "</i>

273
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:11,810
<i>Which is... It's probably Buddhist
or something.</i>

274
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:13,781
<i>It's like... Like a chant.</i>

275
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:16,387
<i>"Peek your... Pick your edge too. "</i>

276
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:18,823
<i>- Smart guy.
- I'm not saying he's illiterate.</i>

277
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:22,154
I mean, he could just use some
night-schooling to perfect his spelling.

278
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:23,818
Just go.

279
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:25,894
Slow. Slower.

280
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:34,769
You all right?

281
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,373
<i>Come on over. It's easy.</i>

282
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,811
<i>Freeze.</i>

283
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:50,581
They always come at night
and bother me.

284
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:55,056
<i>- Oh, come on, it's my turn tonight.
- No way. This is my baby.</i>

285
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,457
Department of Homeland Security.

286
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,029
Wake up.

287
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:00,597
Be invisible.

288
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:01,926
Shh, did you hear something?

289
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:03,693
Yeah.

290
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:08,971
<i>There's that ladder again.</i>

291
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:12,642
What do you think?

292
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:15,644
<i>I don't know, some kind of ladder gang
or something?</i>

293
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:17,543
Oh, the ladder gang.

294
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:20,082
<i>Let's go get some ice cream.</i>

295
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,830
<i>- "Peek your edge too. "
- What's so funny?</i>

296
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:34,226
<i>"Keep Jerry out. "</i>

297
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:38,131
<i>- Who cares about that right now?
- He's not illiterate. "Keep Jerry out. "</i>

298
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,636
<i>- He's not illiterate.
- Who cares? Get over...</i>

299
00:15:40,806 --> 00:15:42,797
<i>- What are you doing?
- I can't be here for this.</i>

300
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:44,772
What are you doing? Mike, no. Mike.

301
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,344
<i>- Mike, put that ladder back.
- I can't let you in the store.</i>

302
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:49,981
<i>- Mike, you're coming over the thing.
- Mr. Fletcher trusted me.</i>

303
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:52,640
<i>Mr. Fletcher's not gonna yell at you,
he's way too laid back.</i>

304
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:55,218
<i>I know he's not gonna yell at me.
That's part of the problem.</i>

305
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:57,582
<i>He's very good to me. I can't
let him down. I can't disappoint him.</i>

306
00:15:57,756 --> 00:15:58,780
<i>Listen, you don't need me.</i>

307
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,789
<i>- You're almost there.
- I'll never speak to you.</i>

308
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,393
I will never speak to you again.

309
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:04,961
Mike! Mike!

310
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:08,027
Traitor.

311
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:09,358
<i>I'll do it alone, baby.</i>

312
00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:11,994
Solo mission.

313
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:14,002
Solo sabotage.

314
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:25,082
Mike! Come back!

315
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:44,632
No, Jerry, no.

316
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:47,397
No. No. You have to go.

317
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:50,935
<i>You see the signs? "Keep Jerry out. "</i>

318
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,509
<i>This is in, that's out.</i>

319
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:57,172
Go home, take a shower, lie down.

320
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:14,264
Oh, come on.

321
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:18,998
Get out of the street.
Get out of the street.

322
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:22,072
Wipe your face.
Jesus. Stand right there.

323
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:24,300
<i>I'll get you some water.</i>

324
00:17:24,743 --> 00:17:27,234
<i>Don't move, just wait a minute.</i>

325
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:39,716
Oh, you feeling better now?

326
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:44,886
<i>Mike, aren't you gonna ask me
how the sabotage went?</i>

327
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,190
<i>No, I wasn't, actually.</i>

328
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:49,334
Oh, come on,
ask me how the sabotage went.

329
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:51,435
<i>Okay, how'd the sabotage go?</i>

330
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:54,128
Terrible. It was a two-man operation.

331
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:57,734
- It was a two-person sabotage.
- Shh.

332
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,845
<i>Ma'am, if you need any help,
just let me know.</i>

333
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:03,743
How about if I need any help?
Should I let you know?

334
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,009
<i>- I wasn't talking to you.
- Yeah, apparently not.</i>

335
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:07,743
Thanks.

336
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:16,190
<i>Oh, that's not in alphabetical order.</i>

337
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:18,329
<i>I know that, it's the new order.
Excuse me.</i>

338
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:20,260
<i>- Do you work here? I don't think so.
- Jerry.</i>

339
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,764
<i>Haven't you heard
about the new West Coast Video...</i>

340
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,563
<i>...more efficient,
non-alphabetical order...</i>

341
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:27,432
<i>...Miss I-Know-Where-to-Put-the-Videos?</i>

342
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:32,977
<i>No, it's time for me
to educate your customers.</i>

343
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:35,409
Do you put everything in your house
in alphabetical order?

344
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:38,049
- Like all of your food in the refrigerator?
- You know, maybe...

345
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:40,981
<i>- Apples, bananas, carrots.
- She might, and that would be fine...</i>

346
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:43,485
<i>- Ding-Dongs.
... because she didn't do anything wrong.</i>

347
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:46,215
<i>You know what I just realized?
I bet she's super-organized.</i>

348
00:18:46,391 --> 00:18:49,258
<i>She's really like:
I hate those kind of people.</i>

349
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:51,328
<i>- You are incredibly rude.
- Don't attack me, lady.</i>

350
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:53,988
<i>- You're incredibly rude, mister.
- Are you done yelling in my ear?</i>

351
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,190
<i>- I'm sorry, ma'am.
- I'm sorry.</i>

352
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:57,062
Did I put your forks
into the spoon drawer?

353
00:18:57,236 --> 00:18:59,227
<i>- Go home.
- Don't put the TV next to the radio.</i>

354
00:18:59,404 --> 00:19:00,894
<i>- Why don't you just go, go, go?
- Get some rest.</i>

355
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:02,700
<i>- Lunatic!
- You're the cuckoo. Hey. Hey.</i>

356
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,901
<i>Don't put the shoes in the refrigerator,
because they'll get cold.</i>

357
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,810
<i>- Wow...
- Dumb broad.</i>

358
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,040
- I am really, really sorry.
- Yeah.

359
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:12,376
<i>He's a veteran, actually.</i>

360
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:15,418
<i>He's had a lot of exposure to,
you know, chemicals and stuff.</i>

361
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:19,580
<i>If there's anything you need, we got...
We got books, we got albums.</i>

362
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:21,953
I got some refreshments
in the icebox.

363
00:19:22,127 --> 00:19:23,219
Okay, I appreciate it.

364
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:24,919
<i>You're welcome.</i>

365
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:37,465
<i>Fletcher...</i>

366
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:44,572
<i>...you'll pull through. Every time you think
it's the end, you always pull through.</i>

367
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,945
Look here, look here, Mo.
I wish it was that easy, man.

368
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:48,518
But not this time.

369
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:51,417
<i>I can't adapt, and that's why I'm broke.</i>

370
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:54,423
Fletcher, this is America.

371
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:57,153
Anybody can make money.

372
00:19:57,329 --> 00:20:00,492
But you...
No, let me show you something.

373
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:03,362
We made a ton of money
with this little thing.

374
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:06,129
- What, this is a dish-squirting brush?
- Mm-hm.

375
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:09,138
- And the soap goes in here?
- Yep. Yep.

376
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:11,469
<i>- A great idea.
- You know, the squirting idea...</i>

377
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:12,974
<i>...has been around for years.</i>

378
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:16,444
<i>But we didn't make squat
until we added this.</i>

379
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:18,776
A stainless-steel cover on the handle.

380
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:20,748
<i>People going crazy over it.</i>

381
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:24,411
- Man, our sales increased 800 percent.
- What?

382
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:29,425
And we expanded our market share
tenfold in two years.

383
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:33,053
<i>You need to go visit all
of the successful renting businesses...</i>

384
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:36,099
<i>...and learn and adapt.
You said you can't adapt.</i>

385
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:39,169
Adapt. Then just give the people
what they want.

386
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:42,796
<i>- That's all you gotta do.
- Give the people what they want.</i>

387
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:05,487
<i>Hello?</i>

388
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:06,892
<i>Hello, Miss Falewicz? It's...</i>

389
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:09,659
I... I know who this is, Mr. Fletcher.

390
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:12,565
L... I was hoping to hear from you.

391
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:16,071
<i>I was calling regarding the tape
of Driving Miss Daisy.</i>

392
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:17,731
Mike told me you still have it.

393
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:19,501
<i>Oh, do I?</i>

394
00:21:19,678 --> 00:21:22,306
<i>Well, I'll find it and...
And bring it by tomorrow.</i>

395
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:24,506
<i>Oh, no hurry.
I'm... I'm out of town anyway.</i>

396
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:27,447
<i>I'm doing a little work
and doing a little research.</i>

397
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:29,917
<i>Oh? Well, how long will you be gone?</i>

398
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:32,249
<i>- A week at the most.
- Really.</i>

399
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:34,255
- Can I ask a favor?
- Yes.

400
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:37,293
<i>Would you keep an eye out on Jerry
for me while I'm gone?</i>

401
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:39,157
He destroys everything he touches.

402
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,932
Hi, good morning.

403
00:21:51,108 --> 00:21:53,201
<i>- It's blank.
- I'm sorry?</i>

404
00:21:53,377 --> 00:21:56,141
<i>Rewound this tape all over,
and it's blank.</i>

405
00:21:56,314 --> 00:21:57,941
Really? Did you check the...?

406
00:21:58,115 --> 00:21:59,844
Sure did. Checked that.

407
00:22:00,017 --> 00:22:02,281
You know, sometimes
you gotta use head cleaner...

408
00:22:02,453 --> 00:22:03,545
Okay. I did that, actually.

409
00:22:03,721 --> 00:22:05,120
<i>It'll eat the tapes.</i>

410
00:22:05,289 --> 00:22:07,052
<i>I'll just pop it in, see what's going on.</i>

411
00:22:07,224 --> 00:22:08,714
<i>Excuse me, this video don't work.</i>

412
00:22:08,893 --> 00:22:10,224
<i>- Sorry?
- It don't work.</i>

413
00:22:10,394 --> 00:22:12,021
<i>It does... It won't play?</i>

414
00:22:12,196 --> 00:22:14,824
No, I rewound it,
I played it and everything.

415
00:22:14,999 --> 00:22:16,728
<i>It's nothing but fuzz. Yeah, like that.</i>

416
00:22:17,335 --> 00:22:20,031
Huh. Is your VCR NTSC?

417
00:22:20,204 --> 00:22:21,262
<i>No, it's brand-new.</i>

418
00:22:21,439 --> 00:22:23,339
Do you always blame
everything on the customer?

419
00:22:23,507 --> 00:22:25,304
- No, not at all.
- Where is...?

420
00:22:25,476 --> 00:22:26,738
<i>Where's...? Where's Mr. Fletcher?</i>

421
00:22:26,911 --> 00:22:30,403
<i>He's away on a...
On a memorial trip...</i>

422
00:22:30,581 --> 00:22:34,540
<i>...so he left me in charge
as manager of the store.</i>

423
00:22:34,719 --> 00:22:36,118
<i>So you know what I'm gonna do?</i>

424
00:22:36,287 --> 00:22:40,883
<i>Both of you, free of charge, can have
any two tapes that you'd like in the shop.</i>

425
00:22:41,058 --> 00:22:45,222
No, thanks. What I would like
is to be reimbursed my dollar.

426
00:22:45,396 --> 00:22:46,886
<i>- Okay.
- Because I've had enough.</i>

427
00:22:47,064 --> 00:22:49,624
Okay. Is there anything
that I could do to make...?

428
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,495
No, just my dollar.

429
00:22:51,669 --> 00:22:53,330
<i>I'll just... I was just...</i>

430
00:22:54,138 --> 00:22:56,299
<i>- I'm really sorry about all this.
- Unfortunate.</i>

431
00:22:56,474 --> 00:22:58,032
Yeah, the whole thing is unfortunate.

432
00:22:58,209 --> 00:23:00,336
<i>This button... I'm really... Okay.</i>

433
00:23:00,511 --> 00:23:01,773
That one right there.

434
00:23:01,946 --> 00:23:03,846
<i>I tried... Oh, that's not it either.</i>

435
00:23:04,014 --> 00:23:05,538
You know what?
I think I have a dollar.

436
00:23:05,716 --> 00:23:07,581
- Okay, there it is.
- Good. Okay, great.

437
00:23:07,752 --> 00:23:09,219
<i>I'm really very sorry about that.</i>

438
00:23:09,387 --> 00:23:10,411
Thank you.

439
00:23:10,588 --> 00:23:12,453
<i>You don't have to mention this
to Mr. Fletcher.</i>

440
00:23:12,623 --> 00:23:14,215
- Give me my dollar.
- You can have it.

441
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:16,451
<i>Okay, not... Not a problem.
I'm sorry about that.</i>

442
00:23:16,627 --> 00:23:18,720
- Uh-huh.
- All right, I got these two.

443
00:23:18,896 --> 00:23:21,296
<i>Okay, that's... Okay, not a problem.</i>

444
00:23:30,808 --> 00:23:32,435
Stop.

445
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:41,816
No! No!

446
00:23:42,253 --> 00:23:44,380
All the tapes are blank.

447
00:23:44,555 --> 00:23:48,855
<i>The movies, all of them, they're all...</i>

448
00:23:49,026 --> 00:23:51,756
<i>They're all gone,
all the tapes are gone.</i>

449
00:23:51,929 --> 00:23:53,294
Where?

450
00:23:56,367 --> 00:23:58,426
<i>Mr. Fletcher's gonna flip
when he sees this.</i>

451
00:23:58,602 --> 00:24:01,799
<i>You know that look he has on his face.
He's gonna be so disappointed...</i>

452
00:24:01,972 --> 00:24:04,406
<i>...that he left me with this responsibility.
Look, look, look.</i>

453
00:24:04,575 --> 00:24:06,406
What the duck?
All the tapes are like this.

454
00:24:06,577 --> 00:24:08,442
All the tapes.
I tried every tape on this table.

455
00:24:08,612 --> 00:24:11,376
<i>Relax. It's the TV, Mike.</i>

456
00:24:11,549 --> 00:24:12,777
<i>The TV's malfunctioning.</i>

457
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:15,646
<i>- It's not all the videotapes. Think about it.
- Well, show me what it's doing.</i>

458
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:17,788
Show me how... What was that?

459
00:24:17,955 --> 00:24:21,516
<i>Maybe that's the picture coming back.
Wait, do... What was that?</i>

460
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,551
Why is it doing that?

461
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:28,362
Does that happen when you do it?

462
00:24:28,532 --> 00:24:30,932
<i>No, it hasn't done that at all... Wow.</i>

463
00:24:33,504 --> 00:24:35,301
What is that?

464
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:37,498
Why is it doing that when you do that?

465
00:24:37,675 --> 00:24:38,972
What is wrong with you?

466
00:24:40,144 --> 00:24:42,203
<i>You're magnetized.</i>

467
00:24:42,379 --> 00:24:43,937
<i>You...</i>

468
00:24:44,114 --> 00:24:46,878
You erased these tapes.

469
00:24:47,051 --> 00:24:48,109
<i>It's you.</i>

470
00:24:48,285 --> 00:24:51,345
What happened
during the sabotage attempt, Jerry?

471
00:24:54,425 --> 00:24:59,692
<i>I didn't sabotage the power plant,
the power plant sabotaged me.</i>

472
00:24:59,864 --> 00:25:02,594
Really? The power plant
sabotaged you?

473
00:25:02,766 --> 00:25:04,529
<i>- I'm gonna sabotage you.
- I'm magnetized!</i>

474
00:25:04,702 --> 00:25:06,727
<i>I'm not gonna get... Are you serious?</i>

475
00:25:06,904 --> 00:25:09,236
Sabotage a power plant?
What are you, a superhero?

476
00:25:09,406 --> 00:25:10,771
<i>Don't do this, man.</i>

477
00:25:10,941 --> 00:25:13,068
You were right.

478
00:25:13,244 --> 00:25:15,644
<i>I did have the Driving Miss Daisy tape
at home.</i>

479
00:25:15,813 --> 00:25:17,542
<i>Oh, good, that's really good.</i>

480
00:25:21,952 --> 00:25:24,648
Thank you for returning the tape.

481
00:25:24,822 --> 00:25:26,312
I like your ensemble.

482
00:25:27,291 --> 00:25:30,783
<i>Listen, I wanna rent Ghostbusters.</i>

483
00:25:30,961 --> 00:25:32,326
<i>Ghostbusters.</i>

484
00:25:33,397 --> 00:25:34,557
Is that out?

485
00:25:35,199 --> 00:25:36,427
<i>Isn't that a horror movie?</i>

486
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,624
- Really?
- Yeah.

487
00:25:37,801 --> 00:25:40,099
<i>- That could be interesting.
- Miss Falafelwicz...</i>

488
00:25:40,271 --> 00:25:43,900
<i>- It's Falewicz.
- It's actually got a lot of nudity in it.</i>

489
00:25:44,074 --> 00:25:46,042
<i>- So...
- Oh, you. Come on.</i>

490
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:47,302
<i>You're pulling my leg.</i>

491
00:25:47,478 --> 00:25:49,605
<i>We're right in the middle
of reorganizing.</i>

492
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:52,715
<i>That's why all the tapes are there like that.
We're getting the stock together.</i>

493
00:25:52,883 --> 00:25:54,942
<i>I think you should know
that Mr. Fletcher...</i>

494
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:59,055
<i>...calls me every night at 8 p. m.
Just to see how I am.</i>

495
00:25:59,223 --> 00:26:04,126
<i>And I think he would not be pleased
to see his business go off the deep end...</i>

496
00:26:04,295 --> 00:26:08,061
<i>...because some sort of boxing match
going on on his premises.</i>

497
00:26:08,232 --> 00:26:09,699
<i>- Oh, no, no, no.
- I don't think so.</i>

498
00:26:09,867 --> 00:26:11,391
<i>We're not boxing.</i>

499
00:26:11,569 --> 00:26:14,561
<i>It's just... You know, it's just buddies...</i>

500
00:26:14,738 --> 00:26:17,969
<i>...just, you know, horsing around.</i>

501
00:26:18,142 --> 00:26:19,871
<i>- Yeah, well...
- It's nothing, just boys.</i>

502
00:26:20,044 --> 00:26:23,104
What I can do is that I can get that to you
first thing tomorrow morning.

503
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,838
<i>No, I don't think so. Uh-uh.</i>

504
00:26:25,015 --> 00:26:27,279
<i>I'm gonna come back before 7,
when you close.</i>

505
00:26:27,451 --> 00:26:29,578
<i>- Oh, okay.
- And I really strongly suggest...</i>

506
00:26:29,753 --> 00:26:34,349
<i>...that you get this place in order fast.
- Okay, well...</i>

507
00:26:35,492 --> 00:26:37,858
- Have a good day.
- Yeah.

508
00:26:42,366 --> 00:26:45,824
<i>She's a communist.
I don't like commies.</i>

509
00:26:47,705 --> 00:26:51,334
- I gotta get some rest, I still feel sick.
- Yeah?

510
00:26:51,508 --> 00:26:52,907
Yeah, me too.

511
00:26:53,077 --> 00:26:54,237
What time is it?

512
00:26:56,313 --> 00:26:57,507
This is a message is for Mark.

513
00:26:57,681 --> 00:27:00,081
<i>I was wondering if you had a copy
of Ghostbusters?</i>

514
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:02,241
Hey, bro, is Pablo around?

515
00:27:02,419 --> 00:27:04,011
<i>I'm under a little bit of pressure here.</i>

516
00:27:04,188 --> 00:27:07,282
<i>Do you have a copy of Ghostbusters
that I could...? That I could borrow?</i>

517
00:27:07,458 --> 00:27:09,392
You do? Yeah, yeah. Uh-huh.

518
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:13,519
<i>No, no, no.
Because I don't need it on D VD.</i>

519
00:27:13,697 --> 00:27:16,825
I need it on... I need it on VHS.

520
00:27:17,001 --> 00:27:20,334
<i>Yeah, well, you know,
they said that about laser discs too so...</i>

521
00:27:20,504 --> 00:27:22,096
Okay, take care.

522
00:27:22,272 --> 00:27:24,069
Shit.

523
00:27:45,629 --> 00:27:49,065
A clear image,
even in the middle of the day.

524
00:27:49,233 --> 00:27:50,860
<i>It's as powerful as the sun.</i>

525
00:27:51,035 --> 00:27:53,765
<i>Excuse me. Excuse me, sir, I'm sorry.</i>

526
00:27:53,937 --> 00:27:56,804
<i>Do you...?
Do you have Ghostbusters on VHS?</i>

527
00:27:56,974 --> 00:27:59,602
<i>There's no VHS here, buddy.</i>

528
00:28:00,377 --> 00:28:02,368
Ho, ho, ho, Little Mikey?

529
00:28:03,113 --> 00:28:04,876
What are you doing here, man?

530
00:28:05,049 --> 00:28:07,449
- You know me?
- Of course I know you, Mike.

531
00:28:07,618 --> 00:28:09,051
Oh, I get it.

532
00:28:09,219 --> 00:28:11,847
<i>Old man Fletcher sent you by here
to get a movie that he's missing.</i>

533
00:28:12,022 --> 00:28:14,286
<i>He's too embarrassed to get it himself.
Ain't that right?</i>

534
00:28:14,458 --> 00:28:16,085
<i>- Now, ain't that right, Little Mikey?
- No, no.</i>

535
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:17,488
<i>- Yeah, that's right!
- No.</i>

536
00:28:17,661 --> 00:28:19,458
- Okay.
- I call it like I see it.

537
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:22,224
- All right, you take... You take care.
- I got you.

538
00:28:27,438 --> 00:28:30,430
Tell me the truth, doc.
How long have I got left?

539
00:28:30,607 --> 00:28:31,733
Ten minutes.

540
00:28:32,309 --> 00:28:33,833
Ten minutes?

541
00:28:34,011 --> 00:28:36,275
This should help.

542
00:29:10,247 --> 00:29:13,239
<i>Miss Kobayashi had a fever of...</i>

543
00:29:13,417 --> 00:29:16,750
<i>I'm Bill Murray, you're everybody else.</i>

544
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,115
<i>What, are you crazy?
She's never gonna buy it.</i>

545
00:29:19,289 --> 00:29:23,885
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah. She doesn't know
what the movie's supposed to look like.</i>

546
00:29:24,061 --> 00:29:27,462
<i>The only thing that she knows
is what's on this box.</i>

547
00:29:27,631 --> 00:29:29,326
<i>She's never seen it before.</i>

548
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:33,596
<i>If we stay 10 feet away from the camera
she's not gonna recognize us.</i>

549
00:29:33,771 --> 00:29:36,763
We come up with some special effects,
we do it ourselves.

550
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:39,101
<i>She's gonna be back in, like,
two hours and 45 minutes.</i>

551
00:29:39,276 --> 00:29:41,506
<i>She's on the phone with Fletcher
every night.</i>

552
00:29:41,678 --> 00:29:43,475
The first scene is at the library.

553
00:29:43,647 --> 00:29:46,241
And take that thing off, please.

554
00:29:46,717 --> 00:29:48,207
Okay.

555
00:29:54,091 --> 00:29:56,616
And action.

556
00:29:59,062 --> 00:30:00,723
- Start over. Sorry, cut.
- What?

557
00:30:00,898 --> 00:30:02,024
I looked right in the lens.

558
00:30:02,199 --> 00:30:03,257
<i>- We gotta start over.
- We can't start over.</i>

559
00:30:03,433 --> 00:30:05,401
- I looked right in the lens.
- You just have to do one good take.

560
00:30:05,569 --> 00:30:07,332
<i>All right? Don't...
Listen, what you're doing is good.</i>

561
00:30:07,504 --> 00:30:08,562
- I am doing good, right?
- Just do the same thing.

562
00:30:08,739 --> 00:30:10,229
- Yeah, just do the same thing.
- Am I doing great?

563
00:30:10,407 --> 00:30:12,238
<i>- You're doing great, but don't look...
- All right, you're doing good too...</i>

564
00:30:12,409 --> 00:30:15,207
<i>...with the cinematography.
- All right, thanks. Okay, good.</i>

565
00:30:15,379 --> 00:30:16,505
Go check the cards.

566
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,875
Check the cards.

567
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:23,010
<i>You're doing... That's good, that's right.
That's great. That's good.</i>

568
00:30:23,187 --> 00:30:25,621
<i>- Put your head down, put your head down.
- I can't see.</i>

569
00:30:25,789 --> 00:30:27,723
Go back to the shelf.

570
00:30:29,326 --> 00:30:32,386
Suspecting nothing, and ghosts.
Ghosts.

571
00:30:43,774 --> 00:30:47,403
<i>When you're walking down the street
And you see a little ghost</i>

572
00:30:47,578 --> 00:30:51,014
<i>What you gonna
Do about Ghostbusters?</i>

573
00:30:51,181 --> 00:30:55,083
<i>- What? What? What is that?
- That's the Ghostbusters theme song.</i>

574
00:30:55,686 --> 00:30:57,654
<i>- No.
- I'm pretty sure it is.</i>

575
00:31:12,269 --> 00:31:14,134
<i>- About this stuff...
- We've got one right there.</i>

576
00:31:14,304 --> 00:31:16,272
<i>Let's get a closer look.</i>

577
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,739
Hey, have you talked to Elvis lately?

578
00:31:22,346 --> 00:31:25,509
<i>We're moving on to stage two.
We can capture her.</i>

579
00:31:25,682 --> 00:31:28,651
We have the megapixels.
You just have to stay with me, okay?

580
00:31:28,819 --> 00:31:29,843
- Okay.
- Okay.

581
00:31:38,962 --> 00:31:40,088
Excuse me.

582
00:31:42,065 --> 00:31:46,263
<i>We got her. We did it,
because we're Ghostbusters.</i>

583
00:31:46,436 --> 00:31:47,528
- All right.
- Pound it.

584
00:31:47,704 --> 00:31:50,639
<i>I'm in the hotel reading area
for children...</i>

585
00:31:50,807 --> 00:31:53,037
<i>...and I'm getting a lot of creepy vibes.</i>

586
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:55,405
I think I did hear something.

587
00:31:55,579 --> 00:31:57,979
<i>You heard something?
Stay where you are, I'm on my way.</i>

588
00:32:10,794 --> 00:32:13,422
I got... I got slimed.

589
00:32:18,835 --> 00:32:22,396
Okay, Wilson, go now. Wilson, now!

590
00:32:22,572 --> 00:32:24,096
- Wilson?
- Should I come in now?

591
00:32:24,274 --> 00:32:26,401
<i>- Yes, for duck's sake, now, Wilson.
- I wasn't sure.</i>

592
00:32:26,576 --> 00:32:31,536
<i>If you or any of your family
have seen ectoplasmic apparitions...</i>

593
00:32:31,715 --> 00:32:34,047
<i>...or heard funny noises in your attic...</i>

594
00:32:34,217 --> 00:32:35,548
Call Ghostbusters.

595
00:32:35,719 --> 00:32:38,119
<i>We're fully staffed and ready
24 hours a day...</i>

596
00:32:38,288 --> 00:32:40,415
<i>...to fulfill your supernatural needs.</i>

597
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:43,115
<i>- We're ready to believe you.
- We're ready to believe you.</i>

598
00:32:43,293 --> 00:32:45,352
Look at the refrigerator.

599
00:32:48,131 --> 00:32:51,623
<i>Hello, I need Ghostbusters, fast.
There's a strange alien in my refrigerator.</i>

600
00:32:55,872 --> 00:32:58,898
<i>- Okay, go.
- Rock 'n' roll. How does it look?</i>

601
00:32:59,076 --> 00:33:01,044
<i>- Amazing, very real.
- Hey, come on. Yeah.</i>

602
00:33:01,211 --> 00:33:03,805
Okay, now, the next scene
is the car screeching through the night.

603
00:33:03,981 --> 00:33:05,175
<i>- Okay.
- Well, not night...</i>

604
00:33:05,349 --> 00:33:07,715
<i>...because we're not in the night.
We gotta just go with the day.</i>

605
00:33:07,884 --> 00:33:09,852
No, no, no. All dramatic scenes
are shot at night.

606
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,988
You got... You gotta...
You gotta shoot it at night.

607
00:33:12,155 --> 00:33:15,318
- The day is fine. What are you doing?
- And then, you also have to wet the floor.

608
00:33:15,492 --> 00:33:16,925
- You wet the floor.
- Would you stop?

609
00:33:17,094 --> 00:33:18,823
<i>That's just a waste of water.
Would you stop?</i>

610
00:33:18,996 --> 00:33:20,827
<i>Mike, I'm not gonna botch this job, man.</i>

611
00:33:20,998 --> 00:33:23,364
<i>If you wanna do it in the day,
you'll find somebody else.</i>

612
00:33:23,533 --> 00:33:26,866
<i>Miss Falewicz will be back
in less than an hour. We don't have time.</i>

613
00:33:27,037 --> 00:33:29,699
We just need a minimum amount
of professionalism.

614
00:33:29,873 --> 00:33:32,137
I can shoot a night scene in the day,
give me the camera.

615
00:33:32,309 --> 00:33:33,674
- No.
- Give me the camera.

616
00:33:33,844 --> 00:33:35,243
Let me just show you how you...

617
00:33:36,747 --> 00:33:40,513
<i>You... You cannot touch the camera. You're
gonna erase everything that we've done.</i>

618
00:33:40,684 --> 00:33:44,415
<i>Mike, look on the side of the camera.
There's a button that says, "negative. "</i>

619
00:33:44,588 --> 00:33:47,455
See? Makes it look like nighttime
in the day. Am I right?

620
00:33:47,624 --> 00:33:49,455
<i>- Oh, there it goes.
- Thank you, you're welcome.</i>

621
00:33:49,626 --> 00:33:52,891
<i>Your face is negative, though. Don't.</i>

622
00:33:53,063 --> 00:33:55,258
<i>- There's something we can do about that.
- What?</i>

623
00:33:55,432 --> 00:33:57,798
- Okay, go.
- All right.

624
00:33:59,102 --> 00:34:01,730
<i>- Close your eyes.
- You're telling me that now?</i>

625
00:34:01,905 --> 00:34:03,998
Sorry. Good job.

626
00:34:05,142 --> 00:34:10,409
Gotta run,
got a date with a Ghostbuster.

627
00:34:15,385 --> 00:34:16,613
Busting makes me feel good.

628
00:34:17,888 --> 00:34:20,880
Okay, Wilson.

629
00:34:21,858 --> 00:34:25,225
- Ghostbusters, open the door!
- Wait, wait, do it one more time.

630
00:34:25,395 --> 00:34:26,828
Ghostbusters, open the...

631
00:34:26,997 --> 00:34:29,898
Are you the Gatekeeper
or the Keymaster?

632
00:34:30,067 --> 00:34:33,230
Are you the Keymaster?
I want your key inside of me.

633
00:34:33,403 --> 00:34:35,667
<i>- Are you menstruating?
- That's not from the...</i>

634
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:38,433
<i>Back off, I'm the scientist here.</i>

635
00:34:38,608 --> 00:34:41,133
<i>I'm gonna open that refrigerator door.</i>

636
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:50,215
<i>Let's show this prehistoric bitch
how we do things downtown.</i>

637
00:34:50,387 --> 00:34:51,820
<i>We ionized it.</i>

638
00:34:51,988 --> 00:34:54,980
It was a complete particle reversal.

639
00:34:55,625 --> 00:34:56,649
Can I go now?

640
00:34:56,827 --> 00:34:59,489
<i>As the 100-foot marshmallow man
tried to kill them...</i>

641
00:34:59,663 --> 00:35:05,499
<i>...they decided to reverse reality
by crossing their beams.</i>

642
00:35:05,669 --> 00:35:09,332
<i>Run, everyone, run.
There's a Stay Puft Marsh...</i>

643
00:35:12,109 --> 00:35:13,736
Okay.

644
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:17,107
- Nice working with you, Dr. Venkman.
- See you on the other side.

645
00:35:17,681 --> 00:35:22,675
The end. Starring Bill Murray
and other actors.

<i>Wait, wait. Miss Falewicz,
Miss Falewicz. Hi. Hi.</i>

649
00:35:32,762 --> 00:35:35,322
<i>- I was waiting for you.
- Yeah, I'm here.</i>

650
00:35:35,499 --> 00:35:38,798
By the way, it looks a load better.
Big improvement.

651
00:35:38,969 --> 00:35:41,836
- Oh, yeah. We were just...
- Mr. Fletcher will be pleased.

652
00:35:42,005 --> 00:35:44,166
Yeah, we were doing...
We were doing inventory here.

653
00:35:44,341 --> 00:35:48,505
A nice and tidy house.
First step to combating depression:

654
00:35:48,678 --> 00:35:51,647
- To have an optimistic view of the future.
- Hey, that sounds...

655
00:35:51,815 --> 00:35:53,942
<i>You know what I do
whenever I'm feeling depressed?</i>

656
00:35:54,117 --> 00:35:56,142
<i>- Oh, what's that?
- I clean my house.</i>

657
00:35:56,319 --> 00:35:58,549
- Oh, really?
- Honest to God, it clears the mind.

658
00:35:58,722 --> 00:36:01,486
<i>You'll see, in the morning
when the sun comes in.</i>

659
00:36:01,658 --> 00:36:04,388
- Uh-huh.
- Number one step for fighting depression.

660
00:36:04,561 --> 00:36:07,997
<i>Here it is, Miss Falewicz, there you go.
Ghostbusters like you asked for.</i>

661
00:36:08,165 --> 00:36:09,996
<i>When you're walking down the street</i>

662
00:36:10,167 --> 00:36:12,067
<i>- You know what, I...
- And you see a little ghost</i>

663
00:36:12,235 --> 00:36:14,999
- All right.
- I have a... I have a...

664
00:36:15,172 --> 00:36:16,662
I was gonna say I have a...

665
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:19,308
<i>- What are you doing? I have a method.
- What you gonna do?</i>

666
00:36:19,476 --> 00:36:22,343
<i>- A foolproof method for fighting depression.

00:36:22,512 --> 00:36:25,310
You get a notebook
and you, like, put four columns in it.

668
00:36:25,482 --> 00:36:27,177
<i>- And the first column is...
- And you see a little ghost</i>

669
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:28,612
<i>...the effort you believe...
- What you gonna do?</i>

670
00:36:28,785 --> 00:36:30,514
<i>...the dreaded task will take...
- Ghostbusters</i>

671
00:36:30,687 --> 00:36:32,848
<i>Tell me the other two tomorrow,
because I'm really...</i>

672
00:36:33,023 --> 00:36:35,355
<i>- Good movie you got there.
- I'm focused on those first two.</i>

673
00:36:35,525 --> 00:36:37,755
Wait a sec, 1 dollar, one tape,
one night, right?

674
00:36:37,928 --> 00:36:40,055
<i>- No, Miss Falewicz, it's not a problem.
- I'm in it.</i>

675
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:42,130
<i>- It's okay. That's on us today.
- Really?</i>

676
00:36:42,299 --> 00:36:43,323
- Uh-huh.
- Thank you.

677
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:47,527
<i>- You're welcome. Take care.
- Enjoy the movie.</i>

678
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:53,239
<i>We should've had, like, a premiere
of that thing or something.</i>

679
00:36:54,444 --> 00:36:56,105
<i>- What?
- What are you talking about, "what"?</i>

680
00:36:56,279 --> 00:36:58,338
<i>She's not supposed to know
that we're in the movie...</i>

681
00:36:58,515 --> 00:37:00,380
<i>...because we're not in Ghostbusters.
- Yeah? Maybe I want her to know...</i>

682
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:02,677
<i>- Maybe I am in Ghostbusters.
- Why is it...?</i>

683
00:37:02,852 --> 00:37:05,286
<i>- Because I'm proud of my work.
- Oh, you're...</i>

684
00:37:05,455 --> 00:37:08,288
<i>- Oh, my God.
- Mike, you have zero ambition.</i>

685
00:37:08,458 --> 00:37:10,585
<i>- What's...?
- That's your problem.</i>

686
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:14,127
<i>You're gonna be stuck in this dump
for the rest of your life.</i>

687
00:37:14,297 --> 00:37:15,958
Good night.

688
00:37:17,601 --> 00:37:19,796
<i>Wh...? What? What? What's a dump?</i>

689
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:21,862
<i>What's a dump?
My... My shop is a dump?</i>

690
00:37:22,038 --> 00:37:23,232
You live in a junkyard.

691
00:37:23,406 --> 00:37:26,864
Not just the store,
the whole city is a swamp.

692
00:37:27,043 --> 00:37:31,002
<i>- It's a swamp now?
- Yeah, a dump swamp.</i>

693
00:37:31,848 --> 00:37:34,180
<i>When you get stuck here,
you're stuck for life.</i>

694
00:37:34,351 --> 00:37:39,220
Come on, Mike, what is so great
about this town? Huh?

695
00:37:40,123 --> 00:37:42,819
- The people.
- The people?

696
00:37:42,993 --> 00:37:45,962
<i>You're gonna make me cry.
The people.</i>

697
00:37:46,129 --> 00:37:49,565
<i>The only reason there's anybody here
is because they have nowhere to go.</i>

698
00:37:49,733 --> 00:37:53,362
<i>Why don't you...? Why don't you
go somewhere, Mr. "Junkman"?</i>

699
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:56,733
We got a customer. We got a customer.

700
00:37:56,906 --> 00:37:59,397
<i>- Mr... Mr. Jack.
- Hi, how you doing?</i>

701
00:37:59,576 --> 00:38:01,771
<i>Yeah, actually, we're closed.</i>

702
00:38:01,945 --> 00:38:05,005
<i>- I'm actually open later...
- It'll just take a moment, guys.</i>

703
00:38:05,181 --> 00:38:07,081
<i>- Rush Hour 2, that's all.
- Excellent choice.</i>

704
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:10,515
<i>It's out. But you come back tomorrow,
and I can... I can get you Ghostbusters.</i>

705
00:38:10,687 --> 00:38:13,212
<i>Seen it. Jaws?</i>

706
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:16,086
- Whoa, what the duck?
- Whoa, what was that?

707
00:38:19,863 --> 00:38:22,388
<i>How about Towering Inferno?</i>

708
00:38:22,565 --> 00:38:24,328
<i>- I saw it.
- Mr. Jack...</i>

709
00:38:24,501 --> 00:38:26,025
<i>...if you just come back tomorrow.</i>

710
00:38:26,202 --> 00:38:28,898
<i>L... I'll take care of all of that tomorrow,
okay, Mr. Jack?</i>

711
00:38:29,072 --> 00:38:32,269
<i>I can't believe you don't have Rush Hour 2.
I'm gonna go to West Coast Video.</i>

712
00:38:32,442 --> 00:38:34,467
<i>No, you... No, you're not.
Dude, you'd better...</i>

713
00:38:34,644 --> 00:38:37,511
<i>You don't do that, you...
Have some morals.</i>

714
00:38:37,681 --> 00:38:40,946
<i>Just wait till tomorrow.
I'll have Rush Hour 2 tomorrow.</i>

715
00:38:41,117 --> 00:38:42,516
Good!

716
00:38:53,263 --> 00:38:55,163
<i>Lee, I'm coming.</i>

717
00:38:58,601 --> 00:39:00,501
<i>I'm taking the stairs.</i>

718
00:39:01,104 --> 00:39:02,366
Lee.

719
00:39:02,539 --> 00:39:03,597
Lee.

720
00:39:03,773 --> 00:39:04,797
Cut, that was great.

721
00:39:19,923 --> 00:39:21,550
Lee!

722
00:39:21,725 --> 00:39:24,853
- Over here.
- Lee, what you doing down there, man?

723
00:39:25,028 --> 00:39:26,859
Carter, behind you.
Behind you, look out.

724
00:39:32,268 --> 00:39:35,669
<i>Lee, this Chinese bamboo
ain't gonna hold.</i>

725
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:40,640
<i>Don't worry, Carter,
Chinese bamboo, very strong.</i>

726
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:52,180
<i>This Chinese bamboo ain't strong.
I can't believe you got me out here.</i>

727
00:39:52,355 --> 00:39:56,223
Forget about the bamboo.
We gotta go solve a crime.

728
00:39:58,762 --> 00:40:01,253
Go in for the kiss now, Jerry.
Go in for the kiss.

729
00:40:01,431 --> 00:40:03,797
Go in for the kiss now.
Go now, kiss him now.

730
00:40:03,967 --> 00:40:05,366
Hold on.

731
00:40:06,035 --> 00:40:08,595
Why do I have to kiss Wilson?

732
00:40:08,772 --> 00:40:10,797
<i>- She's the bad guy, right?
- Right.</i>

733
00:40:10,974 --> 00:40:13,636
<i>She's got the detonator...
He's got the detonator in his hand.</i>

734
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:15,437
You have the bomb in your mouth.

735
00:40:15,612 --> 00:40:17,876
You have to press it against her
to keep her from blowing your head off.

736
00:40:18,047 --> 00:40:19,742
<i>- I'm not kissing Wilson.
- It's not a kiss!</i>

737
00:40:19,916 --> 00:40:22,817
<i>I don't wanna kiss Wilson.</i>

738
00:40:24,521 --> 00:40:27,081
<i>We've been working with him all day.
We can't replace him.</i>

739
00:40:27,257 --> 00:40:28,622
- Could I just say something?
- What?

740
00:40:28,792 --> 00:40:30,453
I quit.

741
00:40:31,127 --> 00:40:33,960
<i>- Amateurs. I hate this movie.
- Wilson...</i>

742
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:35,791
Thanks, good work today.

743
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:37,691
Mike.

744
00:40:37,867 --> 00:40:40,062
Mike, Mike. Listen to me.

745
00:40:40,236 --> 00:40:42,932
<i>Maybe you can understand that
I don't want the whole neighborhood...</i>

746
00:40:43,106 --> 00:40:47,202
<i>...to think I'm having a homosexual,
interracial relationship with my mechanic.</i>

747
00:40:47,377 --> 00:40:48,605
Oh. Okay.

748
00:40:48,778 --> 00:40:52,043
<i>- So the interracial is the issue.
- Okay, forget about the interracial thing...</i>

749
00:40:52,215 --> 00:40:56,811
<i>...but kissing my mechanic is disturbing
and inappropriate.</i>

750
00:40:56,986 --> 00:40:59,284
He could sue me
for sexual harassment.

751
00:40:59,456 --> 00:41:01,117
- Oh, yeah.
- Okay, come on.

752
00:41:01,291 --> 00:41:04,317
Mike, Mike, Mike. I got a better idea.

753
00:41:04,794 --> 00:41:06,421
Follow me.

754
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:10,395
<i>Right, yeah,
There's a stain on this sweater.</i>

755
00:41:10,567 --> 00:41:12,296
<i>- Okay. Okay.
- You see what I'm talking about?</i>

756
00:41:12,469 --> 00:41:14,266
<i>Excuse me, I'm sorry to interrupt.</i>

757
00:41:14,437 --> 00:41:18,305
<i>We're moviemakers and we're making
a movie around the corner.</i>

758
00:41:18,475 --> 00:41:20,807
<i>And we have a kissing scene,
and we need an actress...</i>

759
00:41:20,977 --> 00:41:22,808
<i>...and you are amazing.</i>

760
00:41:22,979 --> 00:41:25,812
<i>I'm sorry, I can't leave the store.</i>

761
00:41:25,982 --> 00:41:28,348
I have work to do, but my sister can.

762
00:41:28,518 --> 00:41:30,486
- Alma.
- What?

763
00:41:30,653 --> 00:41:31,677
Come here.

764
00:41:32,655 --> 00:41:35,818
These guys are making a film
around the corner. They need a girl.

765
00:41:35,992 --> 00:41:37,482
What kind of film are you making?

766
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:40,595
<i>Actually it's like comedy,
action, adventure.</i>

767
00:41:40,763 --> 00:41:43,425
<i>- Like, the types of movies, you know...
- I don't think you understand...</i>

768
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,965
<i>- Like what kind?
... what we're offering you, though.</i>

769
00:41:45,134 --> 00:41:48,433
- We want you to be a movie star.
- I told you I have to stay here.

770
00:41:48,605 --> 00:41:51,335
<i>I can't leave, but she should go,
she's a really good actress.</i>

771
00:41:51,508 --> 00:41:54,341
- I was in the school play.
- She was a fridge.

772
00:41:54,511 --> 00:41:56,536
- A refrigerator?
- Yeah.

773
00:41:56,713 --> 00:41:58,908
<i>So check it out.
Okay, so I'm standing in the kitchen...</i>

774
00:41:59,082 --> 00:42:00,174
<i>...and this is my door.</i>

775
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:03,842
And then I had, like, to close my eye
like this, and I go like that.

776
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:06,079
<i>- Okay, we're gonna take a quick meeting.
- That was the light.</i>

777
00:42:06,256 --> 00:42:07,450
<i>- A quick producers' meeting.
- It's the light.</i>

778
00:42:07,624 --> 00:42:09,216
<i>- You got it.
- She's horrible.</i>

779
00:42:09,392 --> 00:42:11,690
<i>- What's the matter? She's...
- She's the worst actress I've ever seen.</i>

780
00:42:11,861 --> 00:42:13,192
<i>Listen to me, I know a woman...</i>

781
00:42:13,363 --> 00:42:15,593
<i>...who works across the street
at the diner, she's per...</i>

782
00:42:15,765 --> 00:42:19,030
<i>Are you gonna kiss her or Wilson?
Because that's what it is at this point.</i>

783
00:42:19,202 --> 00:42:21,261
- You gonna kiss her?
- I hate you right now.

784
00:42:21,437 --> 00:42:23,234
Okay, we did it.

785
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,505
- Guess what, we just had a meeting.
- Yeah?

786
00:42:25,675 --> 00:42:27,472
- You got the part.
- I got the part?

787
00:42:27,644 --> 00:42:29,578
<i>- Oh, yeah.
- So we should... We should go now...</i>

788
00:42:29,746 --> 00:42:30,804
<i>...because we're actually...</i>

789
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:32,004
<i>- We're shooting right now.
- Thank you so much.</i>

790
00:42:32,181 --> 00:42:34,615
<i>It's gonna be fun.
We're gonna makes some movies.</i>

791
00:42:34,784 --> 00:42:36,342
<i>I'm sorry, can...? Can...? Can...?</i>

792
00:42:36,519 --> 00:42:37,543
- Is this yours?
- Yes, it is.

793
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:40,018
- Can we use this just really quickly?
- No, no, no.

794
00:42:40,189 --> 00:42:43,056
- She just dropped this off to be cleaned.
- Just really, really quickly.

795
00:42:43,226 --> 00:42:44,693
<i>- It'll be all right.
- You don't have to do that.</i>

796
00:42:44,861 --> 00:42:47,091
<i>We'll bring it back.
We'll make sure it's in fine condition.</i>

797
00:42:47,263 --> 00:42:48,355
<i>- What's your name?
- Ann.</i>

798
00:42:48,531 --> 00:42:49,725
Ann. Miss Ann. Thank you so much.

799
00:42:49,899 --> 00:42:51,628
We gotta make sure
she gets a wardrobe credit.

800
00:42:51,801 --> 00:42:54,201
She will get a credit for sure,
and then some.

801
00:42:54,370 --> 00:42:55,462
<i>- I'm gonna be thinking about...
- Thank you.</i>

802
00:42:55,638 --> 00:42:57,265
<i>...parts for you in the future
of our films.</i>

803
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,805
Not you, however. You blew it.

804
00:42:58,975 --> 00:43:00,567
I wanted to make you Marilyn Monroe.

805
00:43:00,743 --> 00:43:02,438
<i>- Now you're just gonna be the cleaner.
- Okay, let's go. Thank you.</i>

806
00:43:02,612 --> 00:43:06,309
- Thank you for letting us use your sister.
- Alma, keep your tongue in your mouth.

807
00:43:06,482 --> 00:43:08,211
<i>- We're gonna go down here.
- It's Rush Hour 2...</i>

808
00:43:08,384 --> 00:43:09,976
<i>...and you're gonna play the girl.</i>

809
00:43:10,153 --> 00:43:11,916
Action, guys.

810
00:43:14,324 --> 00:43:15,655
What...?

811
00:43:16,059 --> 00:43:17,458
- Oh, damn. Damn.
- What was that?

812
00:43:18,761 --> 00:43:20,058
Hold still.

813
00:43:20,663 --> 00:43:21,891
<i>- Stop.
- Sorry. I'm sorry.</i>

814
00:43:22,065 --> 00:43:26,092
He got exposed to radioactive waves.

815
00:43:26,269 --> 00:43:27,896
Are you radioactive?

816
00:43:28,071 --> 00:43:30,062
Is it contagious?
Am I gonna be radioactive now?

817
00:43:30,239 --> 00:43:34,073
<i>Not radioactive! Magnetized!</i>

818
00:43:34,243 --> 00:43:35,267
Give me my bottle.

819
00:43:36,512 --> 00:43:40,004
<i>I'm sorry, we didn't have a chance to...
It's not contagious.</i>

820
00:43:40,617 --> 00:43:43,211
<i>I'm just gonna check...
Sorry. You're fine.</i>

821
00:43:43,386 --> 00:43:45,115
<i>- This came out pretty good.
- I'm fine?</i>

822
00:43:45,288 --> 00:43:47,051
<i>- Not magnetized.
- Uh-huh, yeah. Okay, good.</i>

823
00:43:47,223 --> 00:43:49,748
<i>- Not magnetized.
- What about your friend?</i>

824
00:43:49,926 --> 00:43:51,018
Huh?

825
00:43:52,195 --> 00:43:54,629
<i>Hey, Jerry. I'm really sorry
about hurting your feelings.</i>

826
00:43:54,797 --> 00:43:57,357
I just, like... I got really scared
about the radioactive stuff.

827
00:43:57,534 --> 00:44:00,128
<i>Yeah, I know.
It's my fault, I should've warned you.</i>

828
00:44:00,303 --> 00:44:01,702
Yeah.

829
00:44:04,974 --> 00:44:06,168
Is that you?

830
00:44:07,043 --> 00:44:09,409
- I took the whole bottle.
- Why would you do that, Jerry?

831
00:44:09,579 --> 00:44:12,173
I just wanted to go to sleep.
Am I gonna die?

832
00:44:12,348 --> 00:44:16,250
<i>Yeah, it's aspirin, not sleeping pills,
you dummy. Why be a dummy?</i>

833
00:44:16,419 --> 00:44:18,853
You are not going to die, okay?

834
00:44:19,022 --> 00:44:20,887
<i>- Lf you do what I say, okay?
- What's happening?</i>

835
00:44:21,057 --> 00:44:22,456
<i>I need you to go to the bathroom...</i>

836
00:44:22,625 --> 00:44:24,525
<i>...get me a bucket full of salt and water,
right now.</i>

837
00:44:24,694 --> 00:44:27,424
- Salt, salt.
- Okay?

838
00:44:27,597 --> 00:44:29,189
Just sit down, relax.

839
00:44:29,999 --> 00:44:32,058
<i>- I'm gonna die.
- No, you're not gonna die, I promise.</i>

840
00:44:32,235 --> 00:44:33,964
<i>- I've done it before.
- I have a good future.</i>

841
00:44:34,137 --> 00:44:37,436
Here, here. Drink it, drink it.

842
00:44:39,976 --> 00:44:41,466
Good.

843
00:44:42,545 --> 00:44:45,275
- You okay?
- That was good.

844
00:44:45,448 --> 00:44:48,542
<i>Hey, look at me, I'm doing good.</i>

845
00:44:48,718 --> 00:44:49,980
<i>Oh, that's me.</i>

846
00:44:52,589 --> 00:44:55,149
Oh, not again.

847
00:44:55,992 --> 00:44:58,893
Why does he have to puke
outside of the shop every time?

848
00:44:59,062 --> 00:45:00,996
<i>Oh, good, now he's gonna
puke out all the bad stuff.</i>

849
00:45:01,164 --> 00:45:03,632
- You see?
- But in front of the shop?

850
00:45:04,734 --> 00:45:06,395
Hi. Sorry.

851
00:45:08,338 --> 00:45:09,930
<i>Wait, what's he doing now?</i>

852
00:45:12,709 --> 00:45:15,940
Oh, nice, nice. Pee.

853
00:45:16,112 --> 00:45:18,103
- You guys are so weird.
- It all came out in my pee.

854
00:45:18,281 --> 00:45:19,646
Yeah.

855
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:22,181
Is his pee making it do that?

856
00:45:24,721 --> 00:45:26,052
Thank God for my bladder.

857
00:45:26,222 --> 00:45:28,315
Okay, good. Would you just finish
and come inside?

858
00:45:28,491 --> 00:45:30,789
Alma, I owe you one.

859
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,588
<i>Let's test it out. Let's test it out.</i>

860
00:45:33,763 --> 00:45:35,958
<i>Let's test it out.
Is it warping the image still?</i>

861
00:45:36,132 --> 00:45:37,997
- No. No.
- No? No?

862
00:45:38,167 --> 00:45:40,829
<i>- It worked. It's working.
- I'm demagnetized, you're a genius.</i>

863
00:45:41,004 --> 00:45:42,335
- Thanks to me.
- You saved my life.

864
00:45:42,505 --> 00:45:45,167
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, Mr. Jack.

865
00:45:45,341 --> 00:45:47,332
- What are you looking at?
- Oh, nothing.

866
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:50,001
We were just closing up, actually.

867
00:45:50,179 --> 00:45:52,647
Yeah, so there it is.

868
00:45:52,815 --> 00:45:55,875
<i>I have to pay in mostly pennies.
That's okay?</i>

869
00:45:56,052 --> 00:45:57,713
<i>- Fine. That's... That's okay.
- Thank you.</i>

870
00:45:57,887 --> 00:45:59,047
- Thank you.
- Enjoy the movie.

871
00:45:59,222 --> 00:46:00,655
Your pennies are always good here.

872
00:46:00,823 --> 00:46:02,688
<i>I'm gonna enjoy it, thank you.</i>

873
00:46:02,859 --> 00:46:03,917
Good night.

874
00:46:04,093 --> 00:46:06,254
- Enjoy the movie?
- Yeah, enjoy the movie.

875
00:46:06,429 --> 00:46:08,021
<i>We worked hard on it.
It's gonna be good.</i>

876
00:46:08,197 --> 00:46:11,098
<i>Yo, we gotta find new tapes.
We're gonna get caught.</i>

877
00:46:11,267 --> 00:46:12,564
<i>- We can't keep doing this.
- What are you talking about?</i>

878
00:46:12,769 --> 00:46:13,827
<i>It's going fine. So far, so good.</i>

879
00:46:14,003 --> 00:46:17,769
<i>What? When Miss Falewicz
sees "Ghostbusters"?</i>

880
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:20,738
<i>- Our version is better than the original.
- She's gonna say something...</i>

881
00:46:20,910 --> 00:46:24,539
<i>...to Mr. Fletcher. First of all,
our version is only 20 minutes.</i>

882
00:46:24,714 --> 00:46:27,581
<i>Yeah, but 20 minutes,
it's all the brain can concentrate for.</i>

883
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:29,911
<i>It's the perfect duration.
It's a biological fact.</i>

884
00:46:30,086 --> 00:46:31,348
- I study this, I know.
- Yeah.

885
00:46:31,521 --> 00:46:34,786
<i>And besides, Miss Falewicz has never seen
a science-fiction movie before.</i>

886
00:46:34,957 --> 00:46:38,256
<i>She might think all of them are 20 minutes
long. And isn't she a little kooky?</i>

887
00:46:38,428 --> 00:46:40,521
<i>She probably won't even recognize us.</i>

888
00:46:44,334 --> 00:46:46,632
<i>Y'all need to chill out, all right?</i>

889
00:46:48,271 --> 00:46:49,329
Craig?

890
00:46:50,473 --> 00:46:52,373
<i>- What's up, old lady?
- Yo, come on in, guys.</i>

891
00:46:52,542 --> 00:46:54,703
<i>Yo, Craig. What's up, man?</i>

892
00:46:59,115 --> 00:47:01,447
Dude, you gotta check this out, man.

893
00:47:01,617 --> 00:47:05,109
<i>My auntie got this
from Fats' video store.</i>

894
00:47:05,288 --> 00:47:06,721
<i>This is Ghostbusters.</i>

895
00:47:06,889 --> 00:47:08,686
- Roshambo.
- Water.

896
00:47:08,858 --> 00:47:10,348
- Laser.
- Water.

897
00:47:10,526 --> 00:47:13,188
- Whoa. Uh-oh.
- Oh, no.

898
00:47:13,363 --> 00:47:15,661
<i>Miss Falewicz gave it to her nephew.</i>

899
00:47:16,733 --> 00:47:18,758
It looks like they were disappointed
with the video.

900
00:47:18,935 --> 00:47:20,800
- Come on, guys.
- Do they have guns?

901
00:47:20,970 --> 00:47:24,269
I can clearly see you
hiding behind the counter.

902
00:47:26,776 --> 00:47:29,301
<i>We was closed,
something's wrong with these lights.</i>

903
00:47:29,479 --> 00:47:30,503
<i>- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing.</i>

904
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:33,171
<i>Y'all open now.</i>

905
00:47:38,988 --> 00:47:41,752
<i>That wasn't bad. What else y'all got?</i>

906
00:47:41,924 --> 00:47:44,119
- The whole store.
- No. No.

907
00:47:44,293 --> 00:47:47,262
<i>We actually...
We only have Rush Hour 2.</i>

908
00:47:47,430 --> 00:47:50,263
No, man, he said the whole store.

909
00:47:50,433 --> 00:47:52,264
<i>- Why you lie to me, man?
- I'm not lying.</i>

910
00:47:52,435 --> 00:47:53,925
Guys, make your choice.

911
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:59,538
- What is wrong with you?
- It just came out.

912
00:48:02,278 --> 00:48:04,007
What you got?

913
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:05,807
<i>Right. Yeah, that's for...</i>

914
00:48:05,982 --> 00:48:09,213
Hey, man, hand me one of them
little mint jump off, right there.

915
00:48:09,385 --> 00:48:12,183
<i>We'd love to rent you out
these videos today...</i>

916
00:48:12,355 --> 00:48:15,051
<i>...but Mr. Fletcher, right, he called.</i>

917
00:48:15,224 --> 00:48:17,158
- Oh, yeah.
- We got the new policy.

918
00:48:17,326 --> 00:48:20,727
<i>Two videos per day, per account, so...</i>

919
00:48:20,897 --> 00:48:22,865
All right then,
let me open an account right now.

920
00:48:23,032 --> 00:48:24,727
Yeah, man. Sign away.

921
00:48:24,901 --> 00:48:28,735
<i>We're gonna need your picture I D,
your phone bill...</i>

922
00:48:28,905 --> 00:48:31,100
<i>...your last three rent receipts,
your grades...</i>

923
00:48:31,274 --> 00:48:33,174
<i>...a letter from your mother
if you're a minor...</i>

924
00:48:33,342 --> 00:48:35,742
<i>...the last three countries
you visited prior to this trip...</i>

925
00:48:35,912 --> 00:48:38,176
<i>...your 10 favorite films
and your blood type.</i>

926
00:48:38,347 --> 00:48:40,542
<i>You know, you're real lucky
we don't beat up girls.</i>

927
00:48:40,716 --> 00:48:42,411
- Word.
- For real.

928
00:48:42,585 --> 00:48:44,678
<i>Except Craig's aunt.</i>

929
00:48:44,854 --> 00:48:46,651
Shut up, stupid.

930
00:48:46,823 --> 00:48:49,053
<i>We'll be back
with all the necessary documents.</i>

931
00:48:49,525 --> 00:48:51,993
We still have two to choose, right?

932
00:48:52,161 --> 00:48:54,595
<i>Here you go,
you pick two of those and we'll be...</i>

933
00:48:54,764 --> 00:48:56,163
<i>That's my choice.</i>

934
00:48:56,332 --> 00:48:57,959
- You guys pick the other one.
- No, no, no.

935
00:48:58,134 --> 00:49:00,364
You get to pick your choice,
and we gotta fight over ours?

936
00:49:00,536 --> 00:49:01,969
- Yeah.
- What kind of democracy is that?

937
00:49:02,138 --> 00:49:04,800
Man, who told you
this was a democracy?

938
00:49:04,974 --> 00:49:06,737
Hey, hey, you guys, you guys.

939
00:49:06,909 --> 00:49:10,242
You guys, listen. You guys!

940
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:14,739
<i>Life without civilization is brutal...</i>

941
00:49:14,917 --> 00:49:19,354
<i>...nasty and short.</i>

942
00:49:19,522 --> 00:49:20,921
<i>If you're gonna come around here...</i>

943
00:49:21,090 --> 00:49:25,789
<i>...and spread pizza
all over the walls with gats...</i>

944
00:49:25,962 --> 00:49:27,862
<i>...you're gonna miss out
on some good movies.</i>

945
00:49:28,030 --> 00:49:29,930
<i>So this is what I'm saying.</i>

946
00:49:30,099 --> 00:49:32,192
<i>I'm gonna put all of these videos
into this bag.</i>

947
00:49:32,702 --> 00:49:36,331
<i>Alma, you're gonna pick out
two of these videos at random.</i>

948
00:49:36,506 --> 00:49:38,997
<i>Totally random.
It's the only way to do it civilized.</i>

949
00:49:39,442 --> 00:49:43,902
And everyone will survive. Pick it out.
Shake it, shake it, shake it.
