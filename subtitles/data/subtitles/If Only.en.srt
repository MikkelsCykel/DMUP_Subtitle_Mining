0
00:02:38,153 --> 00:02:43,227
I'm really gonna miss you, you know that?
- Sam, it's just a couple of weeks.

1
00:02:44,113 --> 00:02:48,550
Which is gonna seem like an eternity.
- An eternity, and then some.

2
00:02:51,393 --> 00:02:54,783
That's better, you bloody Englishman.
- Say it again.

3
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:58,511
Say what?
- I love hearing...

4
00:02:58,673 --> 00:03:02,063
you use English swear words. Say "bloody".
- Hm, bloody.

5
00:03:02,553 --> 00:03:05,545
Now, say "bugger".
- Bugger. You bugger,

6
00:03:06,073 --> 00:03:09,065
you bloody bugger.
- That's the one.

7
00:03:12,913 --> 00:03:17,304
Crap! I have to get dressed, run through
my notes, rehearse my presentation.

8
00:03:17,393 --> 00:03:21,306
Have a nervous breakdown,
ignore your half-naked girlfriend.

9
00:03:21,393 --> 00:03:25,750
Give me two seconds. Stay right there,
and don't move your cute British butt.

10
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:29,223
Don't tell me, there's a gift.
There's always a gift.

11
00:03:29,633 --> 00:03:34,070
It makes me feel very guilty.
- Well, that is the general idea.

12
00:03:35,433 --> 00:03:39,346
I have a present, too. I'll give it
to you later. It's a surprise.

13
00:03:39,433 --> 00:03:42,311
Great. I love surprises.

14
00:03:43,713 --> 00:03:46,591
Wow. It's perfect.
- I know.

15
00:03:48,553 --> 00:03:53,627
Vintage, Portobello Road. It was only
ten pounds. And it does come with this.

16
00:03:56,113 --> 00:03:58,707
Nice lining. Silk.

17
00:04:06,753 --> 00:04:09,631
What?
- I have to get ready.

18
00:04:09,793 --> 00:04:13,945
This meeting is very important. If it
goes well, you know what that could mean.

19
00:04:14,033 --> 00:04:16,627
Ian...
- Sam.

20
00:04:18,673 --> 00:04:22,063
Please. Have mercy.
- You know, that's what I was thinking...

21
00:04:22,313 --> 00:04:25,703
that after you close the deal
and knock them dead...

22
00:04:26,313 --> 00:04:30,226
it would be a perfect time to step back,
relax, and go to Ohio.

23
00:04:31,353 --> 00:04:33,947
Sam.
- I want you...

24
00:04:34,873 --> 00:04:38,263
to go to my mom's wedding with me.
You can meet everyone.

25
00:04:41,433 --> 00:04:44,709
You're not coming?
- I tried to free things up,

26
00:04:46,073 --> 00:04:49,349
but, you know...
you know how hectic work's been.

27
00:04:51,153 --> 00:04:53,747
I'm really sorry.

28
00:04:55,233 --> 00:04:57,827
That's okay.

29
00:05:01,113 --> 00:05:04,503
I really am sorry to let you down
about Indiana. - Ohio.

30
00:05:04,633 --> 00:05:08,467
Bugger! I'm sorry. Again.
I'm just going to have to meet your mom...

31
00:05:08,553 --> 00:05:11,545
at the next wedding.
- What wedding?

32
00:05:12,073 --> 00:05:15,463
Ours. Next year.
- Me? Marry you? A guy who confuses...

33
00:05:16,073 --> 00:05:19,463
the Buckeye state with the Hoosier state?
I don't think so.

34
00:05:19,913 --> 00:05:22,985
I'm gonna take a shower now.
- Be my guest.

35
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:33,109
London Bridge is falling down,
my fair lady.

36
00:05:34,593 --> 00:05:37,665
Sam?
- London Bridge is falling down...

37
00:05:38,113 --> 00:05:40,991
Sam!
- ... my fair lady.

38
00:05:42,233 --> 00:05:45,305
I am cool.
Ready for breakfast? Bon appétit.

39
00:05:46,953 --> 00:05:51,390
Hey, I don't care how big this meeting is.
- Sorry, there's no time.

40
00:05:52,433 --> 00:05:55,425
Oh! Oh...
- Ow, I'm such a klutz.

41
00:06:00,353 --> 00:06:02,150
Show me.

42
00:06:03,393 --> 00:06:05,987
Better?
- Much.

43
00:06:06,593 --> 00:06:08,185
Good.

44
00:06:13,193 --> 00:06:16,265
One day
accessing one's genetic make-up...

45
00:06:17,193 --> 00:06:20,265
will be as easy as running a credit check.

46
00:06:21,193 --> 00:06:24,185
That knowledge gives us the power...

47
00:06:25,193 --> 00:06:28,583
to alter our destiny.
- Alter destiny? You believe that?

48
00:06:29,393 --> 00:06:33,511
Of course I do. In the next 50 years...
- People are still going to die.

49
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:37,506
It'll still rain right after you
wash your car, and the Stones...

50
00:06:37,593 --> 00:06:40,983
will still be touring.
That stuff's out of your control.

51
00:06:42,033 --> 00:06:45,105
All you can control are your own choices.

52
00:06:45,953 --> 00:06:49,866
Ok. That would be the other point of view.
But I really don't have time...

53
00:06:49,953 --> 00:06:53,343
to debate destiny.
I'm just practicing my speech. Oh.

54
00:06:53,673 --> 00:06:57,586
Dinner tonight, Tantra, seven o'clock.
- Tonight, seven o'clock?

55
00:06:58,073 --> 00:07:01,463
You're kidding, right?
- Kidding? Not that I'm aware of.

56
00:07:02,313 --> 00:07:05,703
My concert. The one I've been preparing
for three years.

57
00:07:06,913 --> 00:07:09,985
ring a bell?
- Yeah. Your graduation concert.

58
00:07:10,473 --> 00:07:13,863
I didn't forget that. That's...
- Tonight. Seven o'clock.

59
00:07:16,193 --> 00:07:18,787
I'm an ass.

60
00:07:19,953 --> 00:07:23,025
I'm so sorry, Sam.
I can't believe I did that.

61
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:34,668
Good luck. In your meeting. Not that you
need it. You're gonna be great.

62
00:07:38,913 --> 00:07:40,710
I'm sorry.

63
00:07:45,153 --> 00:07:48,145
You've gotta be kidding me. Uh!

64
00:07:50,273 --> 00:07:53,151
Oh, no... the stupid jerk.

65
00:07:54,473 --> 00:07:58,386
You know, don't be late.
I'll take care of this. I'll see you...

66
00:07:58,513 --> 00:08:01,425
tonight at the concert.
- Concert? What concert?

67
00:08:01,513 --> 00:08:04,903
I was kidding. Because it turns out
I forgot the thing and...

68
00:08:06,273 --> 00:08:10,710
This must be that British sense of humor
I keep hearing so much about.

69
00:08:12,193 --> 00:08:15,185
Ok. Well. I'll see you tonight.

70
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:30,986
Gentlemen, we at AGS are not only
at the forefront of biotech...

71
00:08:31,073 --> 00:08:34,065
Not the forefront, the vanguard!

72
00:08:35,673 --> 00:08:38,665
Bollocks!
I cracked it this morning.

73
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:43,266
But it says eleven o'clock.
- Well, the hands must have moved.

74
00:08:43,353 --> 00:08:46,743
At least it'll be right twice a day.
- Do me a favor?

75
00:08:47,353 --> 00:08:51,266
Call Tantra, push my reservation to nine.
Have someone dash over to Harvey Nicks.

76
00:08:51,353 --> 00:08:55,426
I need a present for Samantha...
- For Samantha's graduation concert.

77
00:08:55,513 --> 00:08:59,426
How did you remember that?
- Not sure. Could be because she told me,

78
00:08:59,513 --> 00:09:02,789
she sent you an invitation,
which is on your desk.

79
00:09:03,513 --> 00:09:07,904
We programmed the date into your...
- Ok. Got it. Got it. Thank you.

80
00:09:07,993 --> 00:09:11,383
Anyway, I promised her a surprise.
So, how about a sweater?

81
00:09:12,713 --> 00:09:15,989
Something cashmere. Red.
- She's already got one.

82
00:09:16,713 --> 00:09:20,706
A red cashmere sweater. She was wearing it
last time she was here. She went on and on

83
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:24,183
about how much she loved it.
- Really? Where was I?

84
00:09:24,913 --> 00:09:27,507
right next to her.

85
00:09:39,553 --> 00:09:42,147
You have no idea...

86
00:09:42,433 --> 00:09:45,027
what I feel inside.

87
00:09:45,993 --> 00:09:48,587
Hold me, babe...

88
00:10:07,913 --> 00:10:11,303
Sorry to make you pick me up
all the way over here. Pick up.

89
00:10:13,753 --> 00:10:17,666
Cute hair. Shit. Voicemail.
Hi. Um, I just found your blue folder.

90
00:10:18,393 --> 00:10:23,228
The one with all the notes in it.
I'm on the way to the hotel, right now.

91
00:10:25,673 --> 00:10:28,267
Sorry. Sorry.

92
00:10:47,033 --> 00:10:50,423
Ladies, Gentlemen,
today we are given an opportunity...

93
00:10:51,673 --> 00:10:54,267
to help mankind.

94
00:11:08,473 --> 00:11:11,067
Excuse me. Sir?

95
00:11:13,393 --> 00:11:17,306
Hi, could you please take this folder
into the conference room for me?

96
00:11:17,393 --> 00:11:20,783
My... Mr Wyndham's expecting it.
- I'm sorry, Miss,

97
00:11:21,393 --> 00:11:24,783
but that's against hotel policy.
- But he could lose his job.

98
00:11:25,633 --> 00:11:28,705
Oh, that's tragic.
But, alas, not my problem.

99
00:11:29,273 --> 00:11:32,663
God. Even when you guys are nasty,
it sounds polite.

100
00:11:33,073 --> 00:11:38,147
Now, in terms of your investments...
- Shit. Briefcase is open. I've to go in.

101
00:11:39,473 --> 00:11:42,863
Excuse me for interrupting, Mr Wyndham.
This is for you.

102
00:11:44,233 --> 00:11:48,146
I just thought that you might need...
the exact same folder...

103
00:11:48,233 --> 00:11:51,225
you already have. I see. Ok. Well.

104
00:11:54,593 --> 00:11:58,506
False alarm. Terribly sorry.
I just thought... I just wanted...

105
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:02,109
to make sure you...
he had everything he needed.

106
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:07,709
Because he worked so hard on it.
I mean, really...

107
00:12:09,513 --> 00:12:12,903
dedicated, and he deserves for this
to all go perfectly.

108
00:12:16,033 --> 00:12:19,025
Not like this.
This is my fault. Me.

109
00:12:20,713 --> 00:12:23,785
So, anyway, really nice
to meet all of you.

110
00:12:26,593 --> 00:12:29,983
You were right.
They really are a serious-looking bunch.

111
00:12:30,793 --> 00:12:33,387
In in a good way.

112
00:12:36,593 --> 00:12:39,471
So, in conclusion Ian's good.

113
00:12:40,913 --> 00:12:43,905
Give him the money. See you later.

114
00:12:56,753 --> 00:12:59,631
So, shall we move on?

115
00:13:03,313 --> 00:13:05,907
I forgot my purse.

116
00:13:08,793 --> 00:13:13,628
He already had the folder. Take this.
I never want to see it again.

117
00:13:15,273 --> 00:13:18,231
I think that went well.
- Did it?

118
00:13:18,313 --> 00:13:21,703
Yeah, the glaring, the awkwardness,
the cold stare from Ian.

119
00:13:23,033 --> 00:13:26,423
Just what I was hoping for.
I think I talked too much.

120
00:13:26,913 --> 00:13:30,826
You? Come on, let's go to work.
There's a guy there who loves...

121
00:13:30,913 --> 00:13:33,905
your delightfully impulsive nature.

122
00:13:46,633 --> 00:13:49,625
I can't do it. I'm bad.
- No, come here.

123
00:13:52,153 --> 00:13:55,145
You are not bad. Do you know why?

124
00:13:56,073 --> 00:13:59,463
Because if you were bad
that would mean I was a bad teacher.

125
00:14:00,073 --> 00:14:03,986
In fact, I am a fabulous teacher, right?
Hence, you couldn't...

126
00:14:05,273 --> 00:14:08,265
possibly be bad.
- You've got a point.

127
00:14:11,473 --> 00:14:14,545
Come on. Let's all play together.
You ready?

128
00:14:16,553 --> 00:14:18,350
1 , 2, 3.

129
00:14:29,233 --> 00:14:30,713
Did you land the money then?
- I had them in the palm of my hand.

130
00:14:30,713 --> 00:14:33,147
Did you land the money then?
- I had them in the palm of my hand.

131
00:14:33,233 --> 00:14:37,021
I can't believe Samantha pulled that stunt
right after she spent all morning...

132
00:14:37,113 --> 00:14:40,947
being peeved at me for "not being
in the moment" or some such bollocks.

133
00:14:41,033 --> 00:14:44,423
All birds are like that.
- Yeah, especially the Yanks.

134
00:14:44,793 --> 00:14:47,387
Oprah.
- Oh, right.

135
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:50,745
You're up, guys.
- Excuse me, Miss.

136
00:14:51,793 --> 00:14:55,706
I couldn't help, but notice that you
work here. I was just wondering...

137
00:14:55,793 --> 00:14:59,183
what time you knock off?
- Oh, just piss off, will you?

138
00:15:10,713 --> 00:15:14,103
Oh, shit. Sorry, mate.
- That's all right, Mate. Sorry.

139
00:15:15,793 --> 00:15:18,785
I should be heading off anyway.

140
00:15:19,673 --> 00:15:23,063
Samantha. right. See you later, boys.
- Bye, Romeo.

141
00:15:25,753 --> 00:15:29,143
I think she liked you.
- Definitely liked you, mate.

142
00:15:39,033 --> 00:15:42,946
I just need an objective person
to tell me if the surrealist nudes...

143
00:15:43,033 --> 00:15:46,946
should go on the east wall or if I
should put the phallus sculptures there.

144
00:15:47,033 --> 00:15:50,309
They look pretty amazing
when the sun hits them.

145
00:15:50,593 --> 00:15:53,471
I bet they do. Is that Ian?

146
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:02,787
What's he doing?

147
00:16:09,073 --> 00:16:11,667
The surprise.

148
00:17:01,913 --> 00:17:04,791
Clifton Hall, please.

149
00:17:12,913 --> 00:17:13,982
That's a music school, isn't it?
- There's a concert there tonight.

150
00:17:14,073 --> 00:17:17,145
Your girlfriend's a musician?
- That's right.

151
00:17:18,953 --> 00:17:22,229
And you're having problems
with your love life?

152
00:17:24,513 --> 00:17:28,426
How in the world did you know that?
- Taxi drivers are second...

153
00:17:28,513 --> 00:17:31,903
only to barmen
in knowing the problems of the heart.

154
00:17:34,193 --> 00:17:37,071
So, what's the trouble?

155
00:17:37,793 --> 00:17:41,183
I don't want to talk about it.
- That's a good idea.

156
00:17:41,433 --> 00:17:44,425
The thing'll probably just fix itself.

157
00:17:51,313 --> 00:17:55,386
I can't seem to make her happy.
How can you love someone so much...

158
00:17:55,473 --> 00:17:58,465
and not know... how to love 'em?

159
00:18:00,433 --> 00:18:03,425
So you do love her?
- Yes. Very much.

160
00:18:04,553 --> 00:18:08,307
Well, that's all that matters.
- She's going away tomorrow for two weeks.

161
00:18:08,393 --> 00:18:12,306
And she wants me to go with her.
- What if she never came back?

162
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:17,223
What sort of a question is that?
- Well, go on, picture it.

163
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:23,112
You wave goodbye at the airport, she gets
on an airplane, you never see her again.

164
00:18:23,593 --> 00:18:26,471
Could you live with that?

165
00:18:28,873 --> 00:18:30,465
No.

166
00:18:33,913 --> 00:18:36,507
No. I couldn't.

167
00:18:40,513 --> 00:18:43,585
Well, you know what to do.
Appreciate her.

168
00:18:45,633 --> 00:18:48,625
And what you have.
Just love her.

169
00:18:55,553 --> 00:18:59,466
It's not for another two blocks.
- You can't show up empty-handed.

170
00:19:16,713 --> 00:19:20,626
If Ian bought a ticket, if he's going
home with me, it's really sweet.

171
00:19:20,713 --> 00:19:24,103
Maybe he's coming around.
- I hope so. You deserve it.

172
00:19:25,113 --> 00:19:28,503
And if Ian doesn't know that,
he's nothing but a fuckwit.

173
00:19:29,033 --> 00:19:32,821
Oh, you always know exactly what to say.
- Now remember, you are the bee's knees.

174
00:19:32,913 --> 00:19:35,507
It's a good thing.

175
00:19:37,753 --> 00:19:40,825
Have a great time tonight.
- Thank you. Bye.

176
00:20:07,913 --> 00:20:11,303
Next, Melvina Walters will sing
Juliet's Waltz by Gounod.

177
00:20:39,393 --> 00:20:41,987
Hey. Thanks.

178
00:20:42,913 --> 00:20:45,905
You ready?
- Yeah. I'll see you later.

179
00:20:47,033 --> 00:20:49,911
You two have a great trip.

180
00:20:51,353 --> 00:20:54,345
Oh, hey, Oliver. Oh, you made it! Hi!

181
00:20:55,473 --> 00:20:58,863
Are you kidding?
He wouldn't have missed it for the world.

182
00:20:59,313 --> 00:21:02,385
She was the best one. I love Miss Andrews.

183
00:21:03,993 --> 00:21:07,269
Everyone does.
If I was just a few years older...

184
00:21:09,033 --> 00:21:11,627
Oh, you little...

185
00:21:14,313 --> 00:21:17,385
This is for you.
- Oh, well... Thank you.

186
00:21:17,993 --> 00:21:21,065
Ian, is this not the cutest card?
- Yeah.

187
00:21:22,233 --> 00:21:25,225
Yeah. We should go.
- Well, I...

188
00:21:26,673 --> 00:21:29,665
That's okay. We need to go, too.

189
00:21:34,753 --> 00:21:37,745
It was a disaster. Dunbar passed.

190
00:21:38,513 --> 00:21:41,903
Trahern is pissed, and I'm screwed.
- God, Ian, I'm so sorry.

191
00:21:42,593 --> 00:21:44,390
Forget it.

192
00:21:52,993 --> 00:21:55,871
So... what else is going on?

193
00:21:56,433 --> 00:22:00,346
Lottie has an exhibit tomorrow.
Some big shot gallery, The Zinc.

194
00:22:00,593 --> 00:22:03,869
I went down there to help her.
- Sounds like fun.

195
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:14,507
Wanna dance?

196
00:22:15,513 --> 00:22:19,426
When have you ever seen me dance?
- So, where'd you go this afternoon,

197
00:22:19,513 --> 00:22:22,903
after your meeting?
I called your cell like a zillion times.

198
00:22:23,513 --> 00:22:27,426
I turned it off. I didn't want to hear
from anyone. I spent the rest of the day

199
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:30,585
walking around the city, thinking.
- About?

200
00:22:31,033 --> 00:22:34,309
About us,
and whether we were going to make it.

201
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:37,625
No, I didn't mean that.
You don't understand.

202
00:22:39,553 --> 00:22:44,388
You have to admit our morning was not
the greatest, and the meeting was...

203
00:22:45,313 --> 00:22:48,305
Well, I was wondering what to do,

204
00:22:48,833 --> 00:22:51,905
and then I met this cab driver,
and we talked.

205
00:22:52,953 --> 00:22:56,866
Cab driver? You talked to...
- It was good. He made me realize...

206
00:22:57,913 --> 00:23:01,542
that even though you and I have problems,
we share a lot, too.

207
00:23:01,633 --> 00:23:04,909
We enjoy each other,
and I should appreciate that.

208
00:23:05,393 --> 00:23:08,783
Because underneath everything,
and despite this awful day,

209
00:23:09,633 --> 00:23:12,227
I adore you.

210
00:23:14,473 --> 00:23:17,465
I guess what I'm saying is, I...

211
00:23:18,113 --> 00:23:21,105
I want to soldier on. I really do.

212
00:23:23,673 --> 00:23:25,265
Ok?

213
00:23:34,793 --> 00:23:37,068
No.
- No, what?

214
00:23:37,153 --> 00:23:40,031
I don't wanna "soldier on".

215
00:23:42,833 --> 00:23:47,270
Ian, if I were to stay in London now,
it would only be for you. For us.

216
00:23:47,633 --> 00:23:50,909
And I would do that
in a heartbeat if I thought...

217
00:23:52,473 --> 00:23:55,465
that we were really special.
- We are.

218
00:23:55,993 --> 00:23:59,906
Really? You never tell me how you feel,
or talk about yourself.

219
00:24:00,073 --> 00:24:03,463
You don't want to meet my family.
You forgot my graduation.

220
00:24:04,073 --> 00:24:07,463
We ran into my favorite student,
and you act as if he...

221
00:24:08,073 --> 00:24:12,510
has something contagious. Ian,
I know you have the best intentions...

222
00:24:14,233 --> 00:24:17,623
but I just feel
like I'm a very high second priority...

223
00:24:18,233 --> 00:24:20,030
for you.

224
00:24:22,913 --> 00:24:25,507
That hurts.

225
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:31,423
And the worst part is,
I'm starting to get used to it.

226
00:24:32,753 --> 00:24:35,631
I don't understand.
- I know.

227
00:24:39,913 --> 00:24:42,791
That's what kills me.

228
00:24:43,553 --> 00:24:47,705
If there had been just one day, Ian.
One day where nothing else mattered,

229
00:24:47,793 --> 00:24:50,671
but us.
- I adore you.

230
00:24:51,313 --> 00:24:54,191
I don't want to be adored.

231
00:24:55,433 --> 00:24:58,027
I want to be loved.

232
00:24:59,593 --> 00:25:02,983
Where are you going?
- To spend the night at Lottie's,

233
00:25:03,113 --> 00:25:06,105
to the airport tomorrow, and then...

234
00:25:07,993 --> 00:25:10,871
I can't do this anymore.

235
00:25:18,353 --> 00:25:21,345
I saw you at the travel agency today.

236
00:25:22,393 --> 00:25:25,465
Where are you going?
- Johannesburg. Business.

237
00:25:42,513 --> 00:25:45,903
Samantha! Samantha, wait!
Please! Will you, please?

238
00:25:46,313 --> 00:25:49,385
You can't do this to me.
You can't leave me.

239
00:25:51,353 --> 00:25:54,743
What are you saying?
That I'll never see you again?

240
00:26:09,633 --> 00:26:12,625
In or out, my friend?
It's your choice.

241
00:26:46,753 --> 00:26:48,550
Samantha!

242
00:26:49,633 --> 00:26:51,430
Samantha!

243
00:26:53,433 --> 00:26:55,230
Samantha!

244
00:27:13,793 --> 00:27:16,387
No, Samantha!

245
00:29:19,193 --> 00:29:21,787
I'm so sorry.

246
00:29:26,513 --> 00:29:29,391
I wanted to be with her.

247
00:29:32,473 --> 00:29:35,067
I really did.

248
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:49,269
How can this have happened?
How can she be gone?

249
00:30:58,633 --> 00:31:02,546
I've been working on this song about me
& Ian. I want to give it to him...

250
00:31:02,633 --> 00:31:05,909
before I go away,
but I'm afraid I'll scare him,

251
00:31:06,473 --> 00:31:10,386
so I bought him a jacket instead.
They say there's always someone...

252
00:31:10,473 --> 00:31:14,386
in a relationship who loves more.
Oh God, I wish it wasn't me.

253
00:32:56,793 --> 00:32:59,785
Read one word and I'll kill you.

254
00:33:09,073 --> 00:33:12,463
I was just kidding.
- You, you, you're, you're here?

255
00:33:13,633 --> 00:33:16,625
Yes, and you're scaring me.
- I...

256
00:33:17,673 --> 00:33:20,267
I... I...
- You...

257
00:33:22,073 --> 00:33:24,667
I...
- You...

258
00:33:25,513 --> 00:33:28,391
Ok. I'm gonna approach you.

259
00:33:30,033 --> 00:33:32,911
And now I'm going to hug you.

260
00:33:48,353 --> 00:33:51,345
It's ok. Everything's gonna be ok.

261
00:33:55,353 --> 00:33:59,266
I'm really going to miss you.
- Me, too. I really will miss you, Sam.

262
00:33:59,353 --> 00:34:02,743
I hope you know that.
It's important that you believe me.

263
00:34:03,353 --> 00:34:07,266
I believe you. And I'd hate for you
to go through so much pain.

264
00:34:07,353 --> 00:34:11,266
So, instead of missing me,
why don't you come with me to Ohio?

265
00:34:12,913 --> 00:34:15,985
Samantha.
- You're definitely not coming.

266
00:34:16,713 --> 00:34:19,785
I can't.
- Of course you can't. Work, I know.

267
00:34:20,233 --> 00:34:23,305
Big meeting.
- My meeting. I had a meeting.

268
00:34:23,913 --> 00:34:26,905
And you, you...
- Ok, Ian, calm down.

269
00:34:28,593 --> 00:34:31,869
Calm down.
Look, you're very prepared for today.

270
00:34:32,753 --> 00:34:35,631
And you're gonna be great.

271
00:34:38,433 --> 00:34:42,346
Don't go anywhere. What are you doing?
- Sit. Don't move your cute...

272
00:34:42,433 --> 00:34:45,505
British butt. Don't look.
- There's a gift.

273
00:34:46,753 --> 00:34:49,825
There's a gift.
- This can't be happening.

274
00:34:51,473 --> 00:34:56,308
It can. I like buying things for you.
And I wanted to say goodbye properly.

275
00:34:58,713 --> 00:35:01,705
Portobello Road. Ten pounds. Plus...

276
00:35:02,913 --> 00:35:05,507
Look at this.

277
00:35:06,233 --> 00:35:08,827
Oh, my God!
- Ok.

278
00:35:09,433 --> 00:35:12,823
Not the reaction I was looking for.
- I'm sorry. I've just...

279
00:35:14,753 --> 00:35:18,143
I had a terrible nightmare,
and I can't seem, um...

280
00:35:18,553 --> 00:35:21,545
I can't seem to, to get rid of it.
I...

281
00:35:22,833 --> 00:35:24,630
and you...

282
00:35:26,593 --> 00:35:29,187
We...
- We...

283
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:33,347
... should eat?

284
00:35:33,913 --> 00:35:36,905
Yes. Yes.
We should have breakfast.

285
00:35:37,913 --> 00:35:40,905
Let's have breakfast. Together.

286
00:35:43,073 --> 00:35:44,665
Ok.

287
00:36:09,713 --> 00:36:12,591
Oh, I am the coolest.

288
00:36:13,753 --> 00:36:17,029
Samantha? Samantha...
Watch out, the coffee pot!

289
00:36:17,593 --> 00:36:20,471
I see it,
crazy Yelling Man.

290
00:36:22,113 --> 00:36:25,389
I... I know. I just...
You might hurt yourself.

291
00:36:35,073 --> 00:36:36,665
Sam?

292
00:36:41,233 --> 00:36:44,623
Oh, I'm sorry. Am I too loud?
- No. I was actually hoping...

293
00:36:45,753 --> 00:36:49,029
that you'd sing.
- Oh, you need to get out more.

294
00:36:49,673 --> 00:36:52,745
You are a great songwriter.
And you need...

295
00:36:53,353 --> 00:36:56,425
to let people see that.
It's an amazing gift.

296
00:36:57,473 --> 00:37:00,351
You're biased.
- That's true.

297
00:37:06,993 --> 00:37:09,985
Oh. Ow! God... I am such a klutz.

298
00:37:12,433 --> 00:37:16,346
You burned yourself on the hand.
- Keen powers of observation.

299
00:37:17,113 --> 00:37:18,910
Ow... Ow!

300
00:37:25,473 --> 00:37:29,625
Ian, what's wrong with you? I burn myself
with that damn thing every other day.

301
00:37:29,713 --> 00:37:32,307
You do?
- Yes, I do.

302
00:37:38,633 --> 00:37:41,705
What are you doing?
- We always go that way.

303
00:37:42,153 --> 00:37:45,031
And do you know why?
- Why?

304
00:37:46,233 --> 00:37:49,305
Because that's where you work
and I teach.

305
00:37:50,193 --> 00:37:53,469
Let's try a new way.
Loop around. It might be fun!

306
00:38:09,393 --> 00:38:12,385
I like this route better, don't you?

307
00:38:16,513 --> 00:38:18,105
Whoa!

308
00:38:23,433 --> 00:38:26,505
Care to explain?
- Yeah, I just thought...

309
00:38:26,953 --> 00:38:29,945
the scooter seemed a little... speedy.

310
00:38:34,073 --> 00:38:37,463
Watch where you're going!
- You've gotta be kidding me.

311
00:38:42,313 --> 00:38:45,191
It wasn't a dream.
- What?

312
00:38:45,913 --> 00:38:49,826
All these things that are happening today.
I already knew they would happen.

313
00:38:49,913 --> 00:38:53,189
What do you mean?
- The leather jacket. The burn.

314
00:38:53,433 --> 00:38:57,346
The Coca Cola spilled on your sweater.
I... already saw or dreamt those things.

315
00:38:57,433 --> 00:39:01,346
Some happened a little differently, but...
- Ok, calm down. You know, sometimes...

316
00:39:01,433 --> 00:39:05,346
I've had déjà vu, and it...
- But it's not déjà vu. In a déjà vu,

317
00:39:05,433 --> 00:39:09,346
it feels like it's already happened.
You don't know what's gonna happen.

318
00:39:09,433 --> 00:39:12,823
What happened in the dream
that freaked you out so badly?

319
00:39:13,433 --> 00:39:15,230
It was...

320
00:39:21,073 --> 00:39:23,667
It was awful.
- Ok.

321
00:39:24,913 --> 00:39:28,303
Let's be logical about this.
In your dream or vision,

322
00:39:29,393 --> 00:39:32,385
or whatever, what happens next?

323
00:39:35,553 --> 00:39:38,829
You go back to the apartment
to wash your sweater,

324
00:39:39,233 --> 00:39:42,225
and I go to my meeting.
- That is awful.

325
00:39:44,673 --> 00:39:47,745
Oh, on the way to my meeting
my watch cracks.

326
00:39:49,713 --> 00:39:54,548
Ok. So here's what we're gonna do.
We will walk to your office together.

327
00:39:54,913 --> 00:39:58,826
And if your watch cracks,
we'll know that something is going on,

328
00:39:59,073 --> 00:40:01,951
and we'll deal with it. Ok?

329
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:24,947
Almost there.

330
00:40:27,153 --> 00:40:30,225
We're holding hands.
I like holding hands.

331
00:40:30,673 --> 00:40:33,267
Me, too.
- Oh!

332
00:40:33,673 --> 00:40:36,551
Do you have the time?

333
00:40:37,513 --> 00:40:40,391
Sorry. Watch. Sore subject.

334
00:40:50,233 --> 00:40:53,225
It's fine.
- You're just nervous.

335
00:40:56,913 --> 00:41:00,189
You're right. I'm sure you're right.
- So, you ok?

336
00:41:02,033 --> 00:41:05,025
You ready for the meeting?
- Yes.

337
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:09,103
Good luck. Not that you need it.
You're gonna be great.

338
00:41:13,153 --> 00:41:16,543
I'll see you tonight at the concert.
- Concert? What concert?

339
00:41:18,753 --> 00:41:21,745
I was kidding.
That was me kidding.

340
00:41:22,593 --> 00:41:25,585
You know, the British sense of...

341
00:41:26,513 --> 00:41:29,107
Never mind.

342
00:41:29,913 --> 00:41:32,791
Bye.
- Yeah, see ya tonight.

343
00:41:40,673 --> 00:41:44,063
Do me a favor. Call Tantra,
and push my reservation to nine.

344
00:41:44,593 --> 00:41:48,506
And I need a present for...
- For Samantha's graduation concert?

345
00:41:48,593 --> 00:41:51,585
You forgot.
I reminded you twice.

346
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:55,869
Yes, no, I don't know
if I did or didn't forget.

347
00:41:56,593 --> 00:41:59,983
I forgot yesterday,
but I don't think I forgot today.

348
00:42:03,393 --> 00:42:06,465
Did you wear that yesterday?
- Quite possibly.

349
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:10,623
On the pittance you pay me,
I've only got a few things.

350
00:42:11,313 --> 00:42:14,589
Claire, can I ask you a question?
- If you must.

351
00:42:15,233 --> 00:42:19,146
Did you ever have a dream and the next day
everything feels familiar,

352
00:42:19,233 --> 00:42:22,225
like it's from the dream?
- Yes. I have.

353
00:42:24,233 --> 00:42:28,146
For example, last night I dreamt that you
would bore me to death first thing...

354
00:42:28,233 --> 00:42:31,623
this morning, and lo and behold...
- Come on. Seriously.

355
00:42:33,433 --> 00:42:36,027
Seriously?
- Yes.

356
00:42:39,513 --> 00:42:42,585
Ian, I believe
dreams are very important.

357
00:42:43,713 --> 00:42:46,989
They should be listened to.
- You really think so?

358
00:42:48,353 --> 00:42:49,945
Yes.

359
00:42:51,913 --> 00:42:55,792
And I also believe that you should
get your ass over to that meeting,

360
00:42:55,873 --> 00:42:58,945
or you'll be sacked,
and I'll be on the dole.

361
00:43:01,553 --> 00:43:04,545
And those are AGS's main objectives.

362
00:43:05,433 --> 00:43:09,346
To design new ways to treat, cure,
or prevent the countless illnesses...

363
00:43:09,433 --> 00:43:12,311
that inflict humankind.

364
00:43:14,033 --> 00:43:17,423
I'm happy and more than a little proud
to report that AGS...

365
00:43:18,033 --> 00:43:21,105
is way ahead
of the competition in this area.

366
00:43:24,553 --> 00:43:26,145
Now.

367
00:43:27,993 --> 00:43:30,985
In terms of your investments...

368
00:43:46,913 --> 00:43:51,111
These 7-year projections will document
everything we've discussed so far.

369
00:43:51,193 --> 00:43:55,106
We've amortized the cost of the research
over a 10-year period. And...

370
00:43:55,193 --> 00:43:58,185
I knew it!
I knew you'd be here!

371
00:44:18,993 --> 00:44:21,871
Ok. You've heard my pitch,

372
00:44:22,593 --> 00:44:25,983
and I can tell by the unbridled excitement
on your faces...

373
00:44:29,153 --> 00:44:32,543
Oh, come on, guys.
Settle down. This is not a party.

374
00:44:34,273 --> 00:44:38,186
This research isn't about perfect
projections or amortized costs,

375
00:44:38,273 --> 00:44:41,663
or about beating the competition.
It's about giving people...

376
00:44:42,273 --> 00:44:46,710
the most precious gift possible: time.
This is a great opportunity,

377
00:44:47,073 --> 00:44:50,065
and I say grab it.
What do you think?

378
00:44:57,473 --> 00:45:00,465
Did you land the money?
- I did.

379
00:45:00,993 --> 00:45:04,906
It was strange because the other time
when Samantha walked into the meeting,

380
00:45:04,993 --> 00:45:08,906
I thought she messed everything up.
Oh, I didn't tell you guys...

381
00:45:08,993 --> 00:45:13,271
about the dream I had. Of course not,
because that would be tonight.

382
00:45:13,353 --> 00:45:16,743
Ok, then. Tell us about the dream.
- It's more of a déjà vu.

383
00:45:17,593 --> 00:45:21,745
Ah, déjà vu. It's sometimes dismissed
as a random neurological event,

384
00:45:21,833 --> 00:45:25,667
but is often a message from deep
within the soul. And when the soul...

385
00:45:25,753 --> 00:45:29,143
comes tapping at the door,
it's time to let her in.

386
00:45:29,473 --> 00:45:32,067
Oprah.
- No,

387
00:45:32,993 --> 00:45:35,871
Dr Phil.
- You're up, guys.

388
00:45:36,353 --> 00:45:40,141
No, no. That's not what I'm talking about.
There are certain things...

389
00:45:40,233 --> 00:45:43,305
that I know are going to happen.
- Excuse me?

390
00:45:44,553 --> 00:45:47,545
But haven't we met before?
In my dreams.

391
00:45:48,633 --> 00:45:52,546
Oh, just piss off, will you?
- You see? I knew that would happen.

392
00:45:52,913 --> 00:45:55,905
Ian, we all knew that was gonna happen.

393
00:45:56,993 --> 00:46:01,430
Can you remember anything useful?
Like the 3:30 winner at Newmarket?

394
00:46:01,673 --> 00:46:04,949
No, I'm afraid not.
But everything is the same.

395
00:46:05,993 --> 00:46:09,065
It's just in a slightly different order.

396
00:46:12,593 --> 00:46:15,471
Slightly different order.

397
00:46:22,873 --> 00:46:25,467
I... I've gotta go.

398
00:46:35,633 --> 00:46:38,625
Mackenzie Street, please.
- Yes, sir.

399
00:46:49,033 --> 00:46:52,105
You've got to be kidding me.
- Excuse me, sir?

400
00:46:52,913 --> 00:46:56,303
You're the driver from yesterday.
- Anything's possible.

401
00:46:57,593 --> 00:47:02,030
Yesterday you knew certain things
about me. - About your love life?

402
00:47:02,993 --> 00:47:06,065
Yes.
- People in my profession are second only

403
00:47:06,513 --> 00:47:11,348
to barmen in knowing about problems
of the heart. - You said that exactly.

404
00:47:13,913 --> 00:47:17,303
So if you're the same,
if this cab ride is the same...

405
00:47:17,913 --> 00:47:21,826
then everything else today will be
the same. At the end of the day,

406
00:47:21,913 --> 00:47:25,303
my girlfriend gets into this taxi...
It stops at a light,

407
00:47:25,913 --> 00:47:28,507
it's hit, and she...

408
00:47:33,233 --> 00:47:36,111
Is that gonna happen?

409
00:47:37,673 --> 00:47:39,470
Is it?

410
00:47:44,793 --> 00:47:47,785
What if she doesn't get in the cab?

411
00:47:49,193 --> 00:47:52,185
What if I take her out of London?

412
00:47:53,713 --> 00:47:56,705
Maybe if we stay in the apartment.

413
00:47:58,633 --> 00:48:02,023
Tell me, what can I do?
There must be something I can do!

414
00:48:03,473 --> 00:48:06,465
Just one thing. Appreciate her.

415
00:48:07,553 --> 00:48:10,147
And what you have.

416
00:48:11,713 --> 00:48:14,307
Just love her.

417
00:48:21,553 --> 00:48:24,545
Let me out right now!
- Certainly, sir.

418
00:48:27,353 --> 00:48:30,231
No, that's alright, sir.

419
00:48:30,673 --> 00:48:33,665
Why not?
- You paid me yesterday.

420
00:48:36,393 --> 00:48:39,465
Better hurry up.
You haven't got much time.

421
00:49:05,073 --> 00:49:08,986
Samantha Andrews, where is she?
- I have no idea. Are you alright?

422
00:49:12,033 --> 00:49:13,830
Oliver?

423
00:49:17,473 --> 00:49:20,465
There's three next door, as well.

424
00:49:27,593 --> 00:49:29,390
Oliver?

425
00:49:56,993 --> 00:49:58,790
Samantha!

426
00:50:00,793 --> 00:50:02,590
Samantha!

427
00:50:04,433 --> 00:50:06,230
I'm sorry.

428
00:50:08,793 --> 00:50:10,590
Sam! Sam?

429
00:50:17,553 --> 00:50:19,350
Lottie!

430
00:50:27,033 --> 00:50:29,627
Oh, come on.

431
00:50:50,913 --> 00:50:54,189
Can I help you?
- Hi. I know you don't know me.

432
00:50:55,193 --> 00:50:58,583
I'm a friend of Lottie's.
This will sound really strange,

433
00:50:59,113 --> 00:51:03,026
but I need to get into her apartment.
- Never seen you around before.

434
00:51:03,113 --> 00:51:06,822
Actually, I'm her best friend's boyfriend.
Do you know Samantha Andrews?

435
00:51:06,913 --> 00:51:09,985
Of course. I love Miss Andrews.
Everyone does.

436
00:51:11,233 --> 00:51:14,225
If I was just a few years younger...

437
00:51:46,393 --> 00:51:47,985
Zinc!

438
00:51:48,553 --> 00:51:52,990
Hey, can we eat at some point?
- Don't be such a big girl's blouse.

439
00:51:54,753 --> 00:51:57,631
A wimp. A wuss. Cry-baby.

440
00:52:00,353 --> 00:52:03,743
Samantha, thank God, I found you.
- What are you doing here?

441
00:52:04,273 --> 00:52:08,186
I've to get Samantha out of here at once.
- What is with you today?

442
00:52:08,273 --> 00:52:11,663
You have to trust me.
Things are happening from yesterday.

443
00:52:12,273 --> 00:52:16,346
Ok, we already went through this.
- I know, and maybe you're right.

444
00:52:16,433 --> 00:52:20,506
Maybe it's stress. But all I know is
that we have to leave London. Immediately!

445
00:52:20,593 --> 00:52:23,665
I promised Lottie.
- You've helped loads.

446
00:52:24,473 --> 00:52:27,863
You're right. The fallacies
will look great in the garden.

447
00:52:28,473 --> 00:52:33,547
Ian, I have my concert tonight. Remember?
- I'll have you back in time. I swear.

448
00:52:39,313 --> 00:52:44,387
Come on, let's go. I have to get you
out of London now. Just trust me on this.

449
00:53:08,473 --> 00:53:11,863
Ok, let's go.
- Now, will you tell me where we're going?

450
00:53:12,153 --> 00:53:16,066
You said anywhere I want to.
So stop asking. Just enjoy not knowing...

451
00:53:16,153 --> 00:53:18,747
what's gonna happen.

452
00:53:31,033 --> 00:53:34,423
Hang on a minute.
- What do you think? If you don't want...

453
00:53:34,513 --> 00:53:38,426
to stop here, we can just keep going.
- How did you know that this was my...

454
00:53:38,513 --> 00:53:41,903
You told me where you were from.
I've never met your family.

455
00:53:43,913 --> 00:53:46,985
They've been busy.
- I really want to see...

456
00:53:47,913 --> 00:53:51,508
where you grew up. I want to see
where little Ian went to school...

457
00:53:51,593 --> 00:53:54,665
and played soccer.
Sorry, football, American.

458
00:53:59,673 --> 00:54:02,745
I want to see
where you became the man I love.

459
00:54:04,513 --> 00:54:09,587
If you've something to hide, you shouldn't
have said, "Anywhere you want to".

460
00:54:29,193 --> 00:54:33,425
Was that thunder? I think I heard thunder.
It's gonna pour. I mean, you do know...

461
00:54:33,513 --> 00:54:37,426
that it's raining, right?
- You're just trying to get out of this.

462
00:54:37,513 --> 00:54:41,426
This was a lot steeper when I was a kid.
They must have come in here...

463
00:54:41,513 --> 00:54:45,426
with heavy machinery and flattened it out.
- Yeah, unless you've changed.

464
00:54:45,513 --> 00:54:48,903
Me? Not possible.
- Hey, are we going to that shack?

465
00:54:49,353 --> 00:54:52,982
No. We need to get to the top.
- Yes, chief. So what's at the top of...

466
00:54:53,033 --> 00:54:56,582
"Ian's Magical Hill"?
- Nothing, really.

467
00:54:57,593 --> 00:55:00,869
Except the solitude.
Being away from everything.

468
00:55:02,153 --> 00:55:06,066
I'd go up there to read or think.
I felt safe there, at peace.

469
00:55:07,473 --> 00:55:10,351
It's definitely gonna pour.

470
00:55:12,353 --> 00:55:15,629
Pouring rain in England? Not likely.
- Come on.

471
00:55:31,713 --> 00:55:35,103
No wonder you never took me home
to meet your family.

472
00:55:35,513 --> 00:55:38,391
They have a very small house.

473
00:55:39,353 --> 00:55:42,345
Hey, why didn't you tell me about 'em?

474
00:55:42,793 --> 00:55:46,706
I'm always yapping about my friends
and family, but you never...

475
00:55:46,793 --> 00:55:50,183
talk about yours.
- Sam, let's just forget about everything.

476
00:55:51,353 --> 00:55:54,743
You know, I just want to...
I just wanna be here. With you.

477
00:57:20,753 --> 00:57:24,143
You really don't want to talk
about your past, do you?

478
00:57:29,673 --> 00:57:32,551
Ian?
- The past doesn't matter.

479
00:57:36,913 --> 00:57:39,791
What matters is now. Only now.

480
00:57:45,193 --> 00:57:48,185
You really are acting funny today.

481
00:57:48,793 --> 00:57:51,387
Keep it up, ok?

482
00:57:54,993 --> 00:57:57,985
Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

483
00:57:59,473 --> 00:58:03,386
If for some reason you thought
you didn't have a lot of time left...

484
00:58:03,473 --> 00:58:06,067
You mean today?

485
00:58:06,793 --> 00:58:09,671
No, I...
I mean in life.

486
00:58:11,473 --> 00:58:14,545
If you had one day left.
What would you do?

487
00:58:16,713 --> 00:58:19,989
That's an odd question.
- I'd just like to know.

488
00:58:21,033 --> 00:58:24,105
Well, let's see... my last day on Earth.

489
00:58:25,433 --> 00:58:28,709
Shoe shopping.
And eating ten hot fudge sundaes.

490
00:58:29,593 --> 00:58:33,506
And there's that Calvin Klein
underwear model. Might be fun...

491
00:58:33,593 --> 00:58:36,471
to get to know him better.

492
00:58:40,793 --> 00:58:43,785
It's an easy answer. A no-brainer.

493
00:58:45,113 --> 00:58:48,105
I'd spend it with you.
- Really?

494
00:58:49,793 --> 00:58:52,785
Yeah. Of course.
Just being together.

495
00:58:55,033 --> 00:58:58,025
Kind of like now. Doing nothing.

496
00:59:03,593 --> 00:59:06,471
And that's it? I mean...

497
00:59:10,113 --> 00:59:12,707
nothing else?

498
00:59:14,233 --> 00:59:16,827
A closeness.

499
00:59:17,433 --> 00:59:20,311
An intense closeness.

500
00:59:21,633 --> 00:59:24,591
Really sharing things with each other.

501
00:59:24,673 --> 00:59:27,267
Silly things.

502
00:59:27,553 --> 00:59:30,147
Difficult things.

503
00:59:31,673 --> 00:59:35,586
That's what I've always wanted for us,
and if we could have that,

504
00:59:36,113 --> 00:59:38,991
nothing could hurt us.

505
00:59:46,873 --> 00:59:49,467
I love you.

506
00:59:54,193 --> 00:59:55,785
Good.

507
01:00:55,153 --> 01:00:59,066
The rain's letting up.
Do you want to go to the top of your hill?

508
01:01:00,313 --> 01:01:01,905
No.

509
01:01:04,473 --> 01:01:07,465
I want to take you somewhere else.

510
01:01:08,033 --> 01:01:10,627
Do I have to climb?

511
01:01:22,913 --> 01:01:25,905
Maybe we should wait another minute.

512
01:01:26,713 --> 01:01:28,510
Good idea.

513
01:02:10,473 --> 01:02:13,863
Your dad was a very handsome guy.
So I guess you took...

514
01:02:14,473 --> 01:02:17,351
after your mom, right?

515
01:02:18,393 --> 01:02:21,465
He spent a lot of time here?
- Yeah, he did.

516
01:02:22,153 --> 01:02:25,429
After he got laid off in '93.
Here all the time.

517
01:02:27,433 --> 01:02:31,346
When I was a kid, my dad was my hero.
I thought he was the strongest man...

518
01:02:31,433 --> 01:02:34,311
in the world. He was so proud.

519
01:02:36,833 --> 01:02:40,223
His job at the factory
wasn't just any job to him, you know?

520
01:02:41,993 --> 01:02:45,269
Everyone loved him, though.
And his family, well,

521
01:02:46,593 --> 01:02:49,665
we all worshiped him.
- He sounds wonderful.

522
01:02:50,233 --> 01:02:52,030
He is.

523
01:02:53,633 --> 01:02:56,909
Well, he was.
Then the owner decided to relocate,

524
01:02:58,473 --> 01:03:01,351
and they all lost their jobs.

525
01:03:02,273 --> 01:03:05,663
He never found another.
This became his second home.

526
01:03:12,473 --> 01:03:15,863
>From the age of 15 on,
I don't think I ever saw him sober.

527
01:03:17,833 --> 01:03:21,223
And I've been determined
not to let that happen to me.

528
01:03:21,713 --> 01:03:24,705
To live my life at the whim of others.

529
01:03:25,313 --> 01:03:28,385
You don't have to.
- I know. I know that now.

530
01:03:33,993 --> 01:03:37,383
I just wish I could have helped him.
- You were only a kid.

531
01:03:37,793 --> 01:03:40,785
I know. But to watch your father,

532
01:03:43,513 --> 01:03:46,391
your hero, just dissolve...

533
01:03:47,433 --> 01:03:50,311
right before your eyes...

534
01:03:51,913 --> 01:03:54,791
You really loved your dad.

535
01:03:56,033 --> 01:03:57,625
Yeah.

536
01:03:59,153 --> 01:04:02,031
I hope he knew how much.

537
01:04:03,113 --> 01:04:06,185
Wherever he is,
I bet he knows how you feel.

538
01:04:10,033 --> 01:04:13,025
Ian, death doesn't put an end to love.

539
01:04:19,673 --> 01:04:22,028
You think so?

540
01:04:22,113 --> 01:04:23,910
I know it.

541
01:04:34,073 --> 01:04:37,065
Why didn't you ever tell me
any of this?

542
01:04:41,393 --> 01:04:43,190
I guess...

543
01:04:45,113 --> 01:04:48,389
I guess I just...
I just didn't want to feel...

544
01:04:49,113 --> 01:04:50,910
any of it.

545
01:04:52,713 --> 01:04:55,591
I'm so glad we're here.

546
01:04:58,833 --> 01:05:00,630
Me, too.

547
01:05:11,993 --> 01:05:14,951
I kind of wish we didn't have to go.
- Go where?

548
01:05:15,033 --> 01:05:18,423
Back to London. My graduation concert.
- Let's not go back.

549
01:05:20,593 --> 01:05:23,869
Let's just get on a train
and ride off somewhere.

550
01:05:25,153 --> 01:05:28,429
Let's see.
I've been playing violin for 16 years.

551
01:05:29,913 --> 01:05:33,747
I've been studying for 3 years.
I'm about to graduate from one of...

552
01:05:33,833 --> 01:05:37,746
the finest music schools in London.
I think we should go home.

553
01:05:42,353 --> 01:05:44,947
You coming?

554
01:05:57,033 --> 01:05:58,625
Yeah.

555
01:06:31,513 --> 01:06:34,585
What are you doing?
- Just a small surprise.

556
01:06:35,913 --> 01:06:38,905
Something you're gonna love.
- Ok.

557
01:06:48,153 --> 01:06:51,543
I don't think there's enough time.
- Don't be silly.

558
01:07:01,913 --> 01:07:05,826
You said you've always wanted to do this.
- Yeah, and you know why I haven't?

559
01:07:05,913 --> 01:07:10,350
Because I'm scared of heights.
- Baby, there's nothing to be afraid of.

560
01:07:10,913 --> 01:07:13,791
I'll be with you.
- The doors.

561
01:07:27,913 --> 01:07:30,507
Ah, it's beautiful.

562
01:07:35,673 --> 01:07:38,267
Still scared?

563
01:07:39,073 --> 01:07:42,065
Oh, that's weird. I guess I forgot.

564
01:07:43,633 --> 01:07:46,909
Hey, I'm sorry for being
such a big girl's blouse.

565
01:07:53,713 --> 01:07:56,705
What?
- Where did you get that from?

566
01:07:57,233 --> 01:08:01,146
Lottie. Did I use it right?
- Yeah, it couldn't have been better.

567
01:08:06,753 --> 01:08:09,631
Thank you.
- What for?

568
01:08:10,313 --> 01:08:12,907
The perfect day.

569
01:08:17,873 --> 01:08:21,912
I think I'll wear this to dinner.
You're going to love the singing tonight.

570
01:08:21,993 --> 01:08:25,269
Oh, is it that opera business
that I'm so fond of?

571
01:08:27,553 --> 01:08:30,943
I'd rather stay here and listen
to you sing. - Be serious.

572
01:08:33,913 --> 01:08:37,826
I am. I don't understand
why you don't let people hear your songs.

573
01:08:38,433 --> 01:08:41,505
What are you afraid of?
Success or failure?

574
01:08:43,633 --> 01:08:45,430
Yes.
- Sam.

575
01:08:46,553 --> 01:08:49,545
I will sing them. I will.
- When?

576
01:08:50,233 --> 01:08:52,827
One day. Someday.

577
01:08:58,673 --> 01:09:01,745
Have you seen my keys?
Keys. I just had 'em.

578
01:09:06,513 --> 01:09:09,903
Oh, it's alright. I've got 'em.
I've gotta run by the office.

579
01:09:10,433 --> 01:09:13,311
What? The office? Now?

580
01:09:14,113 --> 01:09:18,948
Yeah, I wasn't there all afternoon.
The place could just crumble without me.

581
01:09:19,513 --> 01:09:22,585
It'll just take a second.
- See ya there.

582
01:09:24,993 --> 01:09:26,585
Yeah.

583
01:09:34,833 --> 01:09:38,746
Hi, I need 75 copies,
and I'll be back in a couple of minutes.

584
01:10:49,353 --> 01:10:52,231
One day... Someday is here!

585
01:11:47,393 --> 01:11:51,466
Ladies and gentlemen, that was
to have been the last performance...

586
01:11:51,553 --> 01:11:54,625
but we have a very special treat
for you.

587
01:11:55,513 --> 01:11:59,426
Samantha Andrews, a visiting artist
from America has agreed to grace us

588
01:11:59,513 --> 01:12:02,505
with one of her own compositions.

589
01:12:05,353 --> 01:12:07,150
Samantha.

590
01:12:17,633 --> 01:12:20,705
You don't want to let down
your future fans.

591
01:12:22,193 --> 01:12:25,071
You are in big trouble.

592
01:15:58,913 --> 01:16:00,505
Whoo!

593
01:16:13,833 --> 01:16:15,425
Whoo!

594
01:16:32,593 --> 01:16:36,506
I can't believe you did that!
I mean, what an amazing feeling.

595
01:16:36,593 --> 01:16:40,506
Do you have any idea how terrified I was?
- You didn't show it. You were great.

596
01:16:40,593 --> 01:16:44,506
In the beginning, I couldn't even breathe,
and then this, this calm came over me.

597
01:16:44,593 --> 01:16:47,983
My God, what an amazing feeling.
- You were so incredible.

598
01:16:48,593 --> 01:16:51,585
You're biased.
- Guilty as charged.

599
01:16:53,313 --> 01:16:56,908
Hey, I'm starved. Where are we gonna eat?
- Anywhere you want to.

600
01:16:56,993 --> 01:16:58,585
Ok.

601
01:16:59,433 --> 01:17:03,346
You like this place?
I thought you'd hate it. Cozy, intimate...

602
01:17:04,593 --> 01:17:07,471
It's exactly my style.

603
01:17:09,313 --> 01:17:12,385
You looked really cute today
in your meeting.

604
01:17:14,273 --> 01:17:17,151
I mean strong and manly.

605
01:17:20,273 --> 01:17:23,265
What are you saying?
- You, strong...

606
01:17:24,393 --> 01:17:27,669
like bull.
- But you didn't come to work today.

607
01:17:28,793 --> 01:17:32,706
I mean, I didn't see you.
- I came to bring you the blue folder,

608
01:17:32,793 --> 01:17:35,865
but you already had it,
so I slipped away.

609
01:17:37,393 --> 01:17:40,385
You did look really cute, by the way.

610
01:17:47,713 --> 01:17:50,307
Close your eyes.

611
01:18:02,313 --> 01:18:05,305
Happy graduation.
- Oh my God...

612
01:18:08,673 --> 01:18:11,745
Some of the charms are old,
and some are new.

613
01:18:13,033 --> 01:18:16,423
That's a musical note. A violin.
This one's a flower.

614
01:18:16,833 --> 01:18:21,270
But there's no sense in that at all,
except it was exquisite, like you.

615
01:18:25,993 --> 01:18:28,985
Let's see.
The train that we took today.

616
01:18:30,673 --> 01:18:34,063
That's the Eiffel Tower
that you've always wanted to see.

617
01:18:38,073 --> 01:18:40,951
And there's a frying pan.

618
01:18:42,473 --> 01:18:47,308
You are the only person that I know
that can actually do the flipping thing.

619
01:18:51,273 --> 01:18:53,867
This one's a heart.

620
01:18:55,273 --> 01:18:57,070
My heart.

621
01:19:00,953 --> 01:19:03,547
It's yours now.

622
01:19:18,473 --> 01:19:21,431
Are you ready?
- You sure we can't walk?

623
01:19:21,513 --> 01:19:24,505
It's pouring rain, silly.
Here we go.

624
01:19:31,913 --> 01:19:34,507
Wait, wait!

625
01:19:51,153 --> 01:19:52,745
What?

626
01:19:58,473 --> 01:20:01,465
I love you.
- Oh, I love you, too.

627
01:20:03,113 --> 01:20:06,503
I wanna tell you why I love you.
- It's... it's raining.

628
01:20:06,833 --> 01:20:09,711
You know that, right?

629
01:20:10,953 --> 01:20:14,229
I have to tell you this,
and you need to hear it.

630
01:20:18,153 --> 01:20:22,066
I've loved you since I met you,
but I wouldn't allow myself...

631
01:20:22,513 --> 01:20:25,903
to truly feel it until today.
I was always thinking ahead.

632
01:20:27,953 --> 01:20:30,831
Making decisions out of fear.

633
01:20:32,113 --> 01:20:35,185
Today, because of what I learned from you,

634
01:20:39,193 --> 01:20:42,185
every choice I made was different...

635
01:20:43,033 --> 01:20:46,423
and my life has completely changed.
And I've learned...

636
01:20:47,833 --> 01:20:51,223
that if you do that,
you're living your life fully.

637
01:20:51,713 --> 01:20:55,103
It doesn't matter
if you have five minutes or fifty years.

638
01:21:01,913 --> 01:21:04,985
Samantha, if not for today,
if not for you,

639
01:21:06,113 --> 01:21:09,105
I would never have known love at all.

640
01:21:14,673 --> 01:21:18,063
So thank you for being the person
who taught me to love.

641
01:21:20,193 --> 01:21:22,787
And to be loved.

642
01:21:25,593 --> 01:21:28,471
I don't know what to say.

643
01:21:31,033 --> 01:21:34,025
You don't have to say anything.

644
01:21:36,793 --> 01:21:39,671
I just wanted to tell you.

645
01:21:48,713 --> 01:21:51,591
Thank you. Let's go home.

646
01:21:58,033 --> 01:22:00,627
Are you coming?

647
01:22:04,633 --> 01:22:06,430
Of course.

648
01:22:10,113 --> 01:22:13,105
Ludgate Square, please.
- Yes, Ma'am.

649
01:22:58,273 --> 01:23:01,151
You haven't got much time.

650
01:23:06,513 --> 01:23:09,107
Anything's possible.

651
01:23:42,393 --> 01:23:44,987
I'm so sorry.

652
01:23:57,913 --> 01:24:00,791
I can't believe he's gone.

653
01:24:01,633 --> 01:24:04,625
I mean, why am I here and he isn't?

654
01:24:05,153 --> 01:24:08,429
Some things are just
out of our control, sweetie.

655
01:24:10,353 --> 01:24:13,743
Ian, he had...
a premonition or a dream, or whatever.

656
01:24:18,433 --> 01:24:20,230
He knew.

657
01:24:22,273 --> 01:24:25,663
And he kept trying to tell me,
but I didn't believe him.

658
01:24:29,153 --> 01:24:32,145
right before we got into the cab,

659
01:24:33,473 --> 01:24:36,545
he told me about how I taught him to love.

660
01:24:40,793 --> 01:24:43,671
Loving him was so easy for me.

661
01:24:47,273 --> 01:24:50,265
He just wanted to say everything.

662
01:28:20,993 --> 01:28:26,226
