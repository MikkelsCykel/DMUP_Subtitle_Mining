156
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:53,020
No, impossible.
Tell them I need my normal lead time.

157
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:55,690
Where?

158
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:00,450
I'm getting a black-cat, Friday-the-13th
kind of feeling about this one.

159
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:01,820
It's in Detroit.

160
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:05,830
You can take care of business and
stop by Grosse Pointe for your reunion.

161
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:10,330
Look, Sergeant Pepper.
I really need you to shut up about that.

162
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,710
Sir, it's out of my hands.

163
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:14,710
The gods want you to go back home,

164
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,590
and they want you to delete someone
while you're there.

165
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,220
Would you describe their position
on this matter as inflexible?

166
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,090
Intractable, sir.

167
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:26,510
I've booked you on an early flight
tomorrow morning.

168
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,680
Dossier.

169
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:32,480
All right, listen.
I'm gonna call you from Detroit,

170
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:38,070
and just make sure that you pick up
the dry cleaning and feed the cat, okay?

171
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:41,900
- Don't forget your identity.
- All right, thank you.

172
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,200
(HEAVY SIGHING)

173
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:50,620
Could you tell Dr. Oatman
that I'm on my way?

174
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:53,120
- Oh, yes, of course.
- All right?

175
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:55,630
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

176
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:59,000
I got invited to
my 10-year high school reunion.

177
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:01,630
I'm conflicted.
I mean, I don't know if I really wanna go.

178
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,430
It's in Detroit. You know, I grew up there,

179
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:04,760
but I just honestly
don't know what I have

180
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,430
in common with those people anymore.

181
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,770
I mean with anyone, really.

182
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,890
I mean,
they all have husbands and wives

183
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,480
and children and houses and dogs.

184
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,520
They've all made themselves
a part of something.

185
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,730
And they can talk about what they do.
And what am I gonna say?

186
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:22,990
"I killed the president of Paraguay
with a fork.

187
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,320
"How have you been?"

188
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:27,620
I'm just thinking it would be depressing.

189
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,450
It would be depressing.

190
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,790
Shouldn't you be taking notes
or something?

191
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:35,670
I'm not taking notes, Martin,
because I'm not your doctor.

192
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,580
Please don't start with that stuff again.

193
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:40,300
Martin, I'm emotionally involved
with you.

194
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:41,960
How are you
emotionally involved with me?

195
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:43,260
- I'm afraid of you.
- Afraid.

196
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,590
That constitutes emotional involvement.

197
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,430
It would be unethical to work
with you under those circumstances.

198
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:51,010
Think you're upset
because I told you what I do for a living,

199
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,730
you got upset, and you're letting it
interfere with our dynamic?

200
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:54,810
Whoa!

201
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:57,230
Martin, you didn't tell me
what you did for a living.

202
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,150
- Yes, I did.
- You didn't tell me what you did

203
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:02,650
for a living for four sessions.
Then you told me and I said,

204
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,990
"I don't wanna work with you."

205
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:08,030
And yet you come back every week
at the same time.

206
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,660
That's a difficulty for me.

207
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,830
On top of that,
if you have committed a crime

208
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:13,660
or if you're thinking about
committing a crime,

209
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:16,620
- I have to tell the authorities.
- I know the law, okay?

210
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:20,340
But I don't wanna be withholding.
I'm very serious about this process.

211
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:24,010
- And I know where you live.
- Oh, now, see?

212
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:27,470
That wasn't a nice thing to say. That
wasn't designed to make me feel good.

213
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:29,760
That's a kind of a
not-too-subtle intimidation,

214
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:34,020
and I get filled with anxiety when
you talk about something like that.

215
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,810
- I mean, that's...
- I was just kidding.

216
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:38,060
- The thought never crossed my mind.
- You did think of it.

217
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,730
You thought of it and then you said it.

218
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:41,940
And now I'm left with
the aftermath of that,

219
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:45,070
thinking, "I gotta be creative
in a really interesting way now

220
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:47,950
"or Martin's gonna blow my brains out."
You're holding me hostage here.

221
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:50,120
- That's not right.
- I just wanna work.

222
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,200
There's some issues that I need to
work on in my life.

223
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:55,000
I've read your books.
Your bestsellers on the top 20.

224
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,410
They were both ghost-written, Martin.

225
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,500
- What, Annihilation of Death?
- Yeah.

226
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,460
Kill Who? A Warrior's Dilemma?
I read it.

227
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:03,800
- New York Times top 20.
- Well, I don't know what to say.

228
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,220
What do you say to other patients?
How does it work?

229
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,420
Ask me how I'm feeling.

230
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:10,430
- How do you feel?
- I'm feeling uneasy, man.

231
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:14,850
I'm just dispassionate, I'm bored, I'm...
It's hard to stay in a good mood.

232
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,680
I have problems at work.

233
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:20,350
You know, concept-execution stuff.
And I'm just ill at ease.

234
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:23,270
I don't wanna suggest anything
that might be uncomfortable for you,

235
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,610
but you might consider, just consider
the possibility that part of your problem,

236
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,490
part of the thing
that's making you so miserable,

237
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:31,570
is the angst of killing a lot of people.

238
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,950
Maybe I'll just
put it in the background there.

239
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,580
Come on. If I show up at your door,

240
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:39,040
chances are you did something
to bring me there, okay?

241
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,330
- I don't care about that stuff.
- You don't care about what stuff?

242
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,580
You know, the morality.

243
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:43,670
Hmm.

244
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,000
I don't want to talk about work.

245
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:48,130
Because I don't think necessarily
what a person does for a living

246
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,090
reflects who he is.

247
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,470
So what do we do?
Do we talk about dreams?

248
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,010
What's next? What's the score?

249
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,270
We'll talk about dreams. It's your nickel.

250
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:59,770
Sure. I had another one about Debi.

251
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,940
That girl you're obsessed with?

252
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,900
Don't you think "obsessed"
is a strong word?

253
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:08,030
Recurring dreams of loss and pain
for 10 years featuring the same person?

254
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:12,070
Yeah, maybe it's a bit obsessive.

255
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:15,780
I had one where I was
that television mechanical rabbit.

256
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:18,660
- You know, with the...
- The battery bunny.

257
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:20,120
Yeah. I was the bunny.

258
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,210
That sounds like a very,
very depressed dream.

259
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:23,880
- Really? Why?
- Yes.

260
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:25,380
Martin, it's a terrible dream.

261
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,670
It's depressing to
dream about that rabbit.

262
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,340
It's got no brain, it's got no blood.
It's got no anima.

263
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,930
It just keeps banging on those
meaningless cymbals endlessly,

264
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:36,890
and going and going and going.

265
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:39,680
- Time is up.
- Time's up already?

266
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:41,810
You really wanna do half a session?

267
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,730
Can we just pretend like we have
a normal doctor-patient relationship?

268
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,650
I'll ask you a piece of advice,
you give me an answer.

269
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,650
You know, advice.
Should I go to the reunion?

270
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:54,700
- Yes, yes, get out of town.
- Thank you.

271
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:57,120
Go see some old friends,
have some punch.

272
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,790
- Visit with what's-her-name.
- Debi.

273
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:01,200
Debi. Don't kill anybody for a few days.

274
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:02,960
- See what it feels like.
- Give it a shot.

275
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,250
No, no, don't give it a shot.
Don't shoot anything.

Now, my advice is, you wait till he gets
the witness, and then you guys do him.

No, 17 months ago, I was posting

- No, actually, as a matter of fact,

306
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:55,740
I actually talked to him in Bonn.

307
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,860
You always...
You always have to know everybody.

308
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:00,700
Tell you what.
Why don't I take the weekend off

309
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,580
and you kill him,
since you two are so close?

310
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,200
All right, I'll do that.

311
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:08,620

Hi, I'm Debi Newberry.

This is WGPM FM, Grosse Pointe,
Window on the Pointes.

315
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:22,600
You heard from Massive Attack,
Public Enemy, Morphine,

316
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:27,390
that's my personal favorite,
and Duane Eddy's twangy guitar.

317
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,190
Good to hear
Toots and the Maytals, huh?

318
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:34,610
And as you know, this weekend is
Pointes High class of '86 reunion.

319
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,490
So in honor of this momentous event,

320
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:39,740
I'm making this an all-'80s,
all-vinyl weekend.

on all this reunion-related nonsense.

323
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,250
Hey, I know everybody's coming back
to take stock of their lives.

324
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,420
You know what I say?

325
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:54,090
Leave your livestock alone.

326
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:56,250
Kick back and relax, and ponder this.

327
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,800
Where are all the good men dead?

328
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:04,260
In the heart or in the head?

329
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:06,180
So here's another cold cup of coffee
from The Clash.

How you get a rude and a reckless?

336
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:36,630
Don't you be so crude and a feckless

I went to the market to realize
my soul

00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:53,730
What I need, I just don't have

341
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:59,150
First they curse, then they press me
till I hurt

We say Rudie can't fail

- It's you.
- Hey.

Oh, God.

347
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:16,170
You've been Detroit's most famous
disappearing act since white flight.

348
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,340
You look exactly the same, Mrs. K.

349
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:21,510
- You look great is what I mean. Great.
- Thank you very much, Martin.

350
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:23,470
You have always been
very good at saying that

351
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:25,260
and not sounding like a kiss-ass.

352
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,760
So what happened?

353
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:30,850
I mean, we thought Princeton, Harvard.

354
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:34,020
You fooled us all
in the teachers' pool and went nowhere.

355
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,810
I guess you could say I went west,
you know?

356
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,440
The way of Horatio Alger,
Davy Crockett, the Donner party.

Thank you, thank you.
That's a barrage of imagery.

Are you still, you know, inflicting
all that horrible Ethan Frome damage?

- Is that off the curriculum?
- It's off.

360
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:49,370
- That's a horrible book.
- That's a very nice tie you have on.

361
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:51,620
You look like a mortician. I mean...

362
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,750
- You like it?
- Yeah, thanks.

363
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:54,330
You still got that
Mary Tyler Moore thing.

364

Thank you, thank you. That's enough.

- Good to see you again.
- Good to see you.

- I'm going home.

Are you?

- Gosh, well, they're playing my song.
- All right.

When you were young
And your heart was an open book

373
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:24,490
You used to say, "Live and let live"

You know you did, you know you did,
you know you did

in which we live in

- Couple of months.
- Yeah?

Is there a manager here?
Do you have a supervisor?

386
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:26,090
- No, but...
- How long have they worked here?

- Yeah? Where do you live?

And how long have you worked here?

463
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,270
No, I'm just kidding.

464
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:29,810
(GASPS)

465
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:32,020
Hi.

466
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:36,230
Uh...

467
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:40,030
And here's The Specials,

468
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,780
doing one of their songs.

469
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:50,580
It's Martin.

470
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:53,580
I know who you are.

471
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:54,750
You're not dead.

472
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,460
- Hi.
- Hi. Shake my hand.

473
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:00,300
How are you?

474
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,840
Wow.

475
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:22,400
How... How are you?
It's good to see you.

476
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:25,030
You look great. How long has it been?
Ten years?

477
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,410
How long has it been?

478
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:29,660
Since you stood me up on prom night
and vanished without a word?

479
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:32,120
Yeah, 10 years I think.

480
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:33,620
Yeah.

481
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:37,750
You tell me about yourself.

482
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:42,880
In California, travel a lot
around on business.

483
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,380
- That's it?
- Yeah.

484
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:46,340
That's 10 years?

485
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,390
Yeah.

486
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:50,930
I would hope for a great abduction story
or something.

487
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:53,350
I've had a few thrilling moments
here and there,

488
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,810
but, you know, it flew by.

489
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,610
So, what's your business?

490
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:00,820
Professional killer.

491
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:05,240
- Do you get dental with that?
- No.

492
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:12,330
I gotta go. So you're working?
It's a great... I mean, it's a great show.

493
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,960
I've been listening.
I mean, since I got back into town.

494
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:18,130
- But I'll come back.
- What are the odds?

495
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:21,170
Very funny. I'll see you.

496
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:37,650
Someone has
come to me out of the past

497
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:40,190
reviving a feeling long since forgotten.

498
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:45,490
I know I should be mad, and I am.

499
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,370
- What's he doing?
- No clue.

500
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:57,500
He says cryptic things
and is gone abruptly again.

501
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:05,380
Oh, boy. What...
What is this I'm feeling here?

502
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:08,590
Is this pain? Is this panic?
Is it pleasure?

503
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:11,600
- Am I hungry? Who's hungry?
- Seventy-nine point five.

504
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,390
Okay, the first five callers will receive

505
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:16,100
a sentimental breakfast
from CuppaJoe's,

506
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:19,690
courtesy of the long-lost love of my life.

507
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:23,190
The man who vanished.

508
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:30,530
The man who is walking
right back into the station

509
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,240
and into my booth.

510
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:38,830
Sit.

511
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:54,260
Okay, let's take a random day.
Spring of '86.

512
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:57,350
Two young lovers
with natural chemistry.

513
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:59,480
- (MOUTHING) I'm on the air?
- (MOUTHING) Yeah.

514
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:06,570
A girl sits in a $700 prom dress

515
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,490
on the steps of her house,

516
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:10,530
waiting for the most
romantic night of her young life.

517
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:15,370
The boy never shows up, not until now.

518
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,500
So, what's the question?

519
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:20,330
Where have I been?

520
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,710
More like,
"What happened, Mr. Blank?"

521
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:23,670
I don't know. I could venture a guess,

522
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:26,210
but it would sound like
a rationalization, a cop-out.

523
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:28,710
I thought coming home,
seeing some friends,

524
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:30,720
and I thought maybe seeing you,
of course,

525
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,430
would be the most important
part of that equation.

526
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,970
That didn't... That didn't come out right.
This... This isn't even my idea.

527
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,770
This whole thing
is my therapist's idea, really.

528
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:45,230
Is this bothering...

529
00:31:55,950 --> 00:32:00,250
Okay, so you're back a decade late,

530
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:02,540
and you're on some sort of
therapeutic assignment,

531
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,880
and you wanna sort things out with me.

532
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,710
So the question now becomes
do I allow you access to me,

533
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:11,300
- or do I call security?
- I don't think that'd be a good idea.

534
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:14,680
Grosse Pointe, I need your help,
555-WGPM.

535
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,760
Do you think maybe we could
get a cup of coffee,

536
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:19,140
and I could try to explain or apologize?

537
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:25,730
Come on, Marty, this segues
so nicely into my '80s weekend.

538
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,900
Should a once-brokenhearted girl
give a guy a second chance?

539
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:33,110
Let's go to the phones.

540
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,410
You're on the air.

541
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:36,570
- Hi, Debi, it's Gail.
- Oh, hi, Gail.

542
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,240
You know, I wouldn't take him back yet.

543
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:42,080
I'd make him jump through some hoops
for a while, walk over hot coals.

544
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:45,460
- Make him beg for it.
- Harsh. That's very harsh, Gail.

545
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:48,340
Do you think maybe we could
discuss this in a more discreet setting?

546
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,380
...beg like a beggar.
You know, come on.

547
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:52,760
Next caller, you're on the air.

548
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:56,260
Debi, man, it's Nathaniel.
I don't hear any real remorse.

549
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:58,850
I mean, I don't think I'd let
this guy back in your life.

550
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:01,560
And, dude, I'd make him
wear that prom dress.

551
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:03,930
DEBl: Does anybody else
have a question for Marty?

552
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:06,440
- I do, but he's a shifty one.
- Put that down.

553
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:10,230
I have a question for Marty.

554
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:13,320
- Next caller, you're on the air.
- Yeah, Debi, hi.

555
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,030
Long-time listener, first-time caller.
I love the show.

556
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:18,320
So, Martin, what, no yellow ribbons?

557
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:19,950
Didn't anybody miss you?

558
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:23,000
Don't you think you should tell her
why you're really in town, tough guy?

559
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:26,040
You know what we love?
We love tough guys like you.

560
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:30,170
Thanks. That was our own Michigan
Militia, with their latest chart topper.

561
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:32,960
Come on, people,
do I give this guy the time of day?

562
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:37,640
Marty, do you have any
deeply personal responses

563
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,680
- you wanna share with our listeners?
- (MOUTHING) No.

564
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,390
Okay, he's shaking his head no.

565
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:43,720
In radio, that usually signals
the end of the interview.

566
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:46,350
Grosse Pointe, Michigan,
I hear you loud and clear.

567
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,600
If you love something, set it free.

568
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:53,110
If it comes back to you, it's, well,

569
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:57,240
broken.

570
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:04,250
Damn it. Never trust my instincts.

571
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:33,440
Marty.

572
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,740
Paul.

573
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:40,320
- Don't leave me hanging, baby.
- Hey, man.

574
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:42,580
How the hell you doing?

575
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:46,540
Hey. Look at you.

576
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:48,040
- Walk with me, man.
- Sure.

577
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,080
- I got my car parked around the corner.
- Okay.

578
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:54,630
Yeah. Goddamn, I worried
you joined a cult or something, man.

579
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:56,090
Half expected you to
come back into town

580
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:57,880
in a fennel wreath and paper pants.

581
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,720
- No money in it.
- Says you.

582
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:02,970
- Look at you. You've gone respectable.
- I stopped pouting on the sidelines.

583
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:05,220
I got in the game,
joined the working week.

584
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:07,430
So why don't you valet park
your high horse, slick,

585
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,890
- and take it easy on your buddy?
- It was a cheap shot.

586
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:11,650
Yeah, it was.

587
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:15,110
- Man, let's catch up, huh?
- Yeah, let's catch up.

588
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:18,740
I got a real estate deal. I'm taking them
through a final walkthrough, you know.

589
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,570
- This your Beemer?
- Yeah.

590
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,740
In Detroit? That's sacrilege.

591
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,570
Well, you know, guess who I got it from?

592
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:26,450
- I have no idea.
- Bob Destepello.

593
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:28,750
- Bob Destepello sold you a car?
- Yeah, he did.

594
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:31,460
Didn't he break your collarbone
and steal your woman?

595
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:33,250
- PAUL: Yeah.
- BLANK: So you're in real estate, huh?

596
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:36,250
Yeah, I got a couple of newlyweds
with a decision-making disorder.

597
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:39,340
I'll just hold their hands
and reinforce their clarity.

598
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:42,180
Isn't there some sort of Frank Lloyd
Wright connection with this?

599
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:45,100
You know what? There is indeed.
For the life of me, I can't...

600
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,850
Blank!

601
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,440
Hey, Blank.

602
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,270
I was driving by, I saw you on the lawn.

603
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:59,280
I thought there was gonna be a problem
at first, before I recognized you.

604
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,740
Terry Rostand. How you doing? PHS.

605
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:04,030
Terry Rostand. Oh, yeah,
you were always the guy who was...

606
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,280
- Yeah, I remember you.
- Yeah, '86.

607
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:08,450
How you doing, man? You look good.
You became a cop.

608
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:11,120
- Nice badge.
- No, no, no. I'm not a peace officer.

609
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:12,620
This badge isn't
a meaningful symbol or anything.

610
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:14,460
It's a badge of my company.

611
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:17,340
We don't enforce the law, we execute
company policy for homeowners.

612
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:20,010
- I get it. Cool. Cool.
- Yeah.

613
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:22,800
- You mind talking a little shop?
- Sure.

614
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,840
When are you authorized
to use deadly force?

615
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:26,350
Well, you know, of course,

616
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:28,810
taxes provide your basic service,
police and whatnot,

617
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:30,640
but our customers
need a bit more than that.

618
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:33,730
So if we find you on the property,
you know, we do what we have to do.

619
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:36,730
So if I just look suspicious
on your customer's property

620
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:39,190
under those, you know,
heightened circumstances,

621
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,360
you have the authority to shoot me?

622
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,700
Correct.

623
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,910
Wow. All right, all right.
How'd you get the gig?

624
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:46,870
You know, they were hiring.

625
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:49,330
- It was only a two-week course.
- Yeah, that's good.

00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:50,490
- You look good.
- Yeah, thanks.

when my time comes, if it ever does,

635
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,310

I want a wife like you.

- And you'll be safe here.
- We really gotta go.

Okay, give me a call, you guys.

You're not gonna go through
another broker, are you?

639
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:22,780
Definitely not.

640
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:25,700
Cute couple.
I don't think they're buyers though.

641

I don't know if you're qualified
to make that statement.

Did you get a call, Terry?

645
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:36,330
No, I was just driving by,
and, you know,

646
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,960
I saw some people milling
around the lawn here.

647
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,210
No, there was just me. I was right there.

648
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,250
Okay, that's what I thought.
I just came by.

649
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:45,300
I show people houses here,
and I'd appreciate if you don't show up.

in the neighborhood unannounced...

- No, but you don't know the alarm code.

- Did you get a call?
- No, they go off.

653
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,980
Okay, you're gonna have to go.

654
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,730
I'm more a part of this
neighborhood than you are.

655

And besides, a lot of times

when you're checking,

- and the alarm goes off.
- Wow.

658
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:04,650
Yeah. Yeah, for sure.

659

Well, I'm sorry about
the temporary thing...

- Yeah. They tore it down

- in the name of convenience.
- Yeah, I brokered the deal.

00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:34,390
- Yeah, okay.
- By the way, is this live, or, you know,

769
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,770
- are we being broadcast again?
- Not right now,

770
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:39,770
but I tend to record everything
because you never know.

771
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:41,610
Right, right. That's a good point.

772
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:43,030
- I'll see you there.
- Okay.

773
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:46,610
I'd like to explain some things to you
and have a good...

774
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,830
Martin Blank.

775
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:04,130
- You seem very nervous.
- No, no, I'm not. It's just...

776
00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:07,300
Why do you keep looking over
your shoulder?

777
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:10,390
No, I just don't like having my back,
you know... It's a habit.

778
00:46:10,510 --> 00:46:13,350
Let's not talk about that.
I want to talk to you.

779
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:14,850
- Okay.
- Put the spotlight on you.

780
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:17,100
- Sure.
- You got married.

781
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:20,150
That's hard to imagine.
It's just unbelievable.

782
00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:23,230
No, it's pretty normal, Martin.
It happens all the time.

783
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:26,150
It's not like you went away
for the weekend.

784
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:27,900
Can I ask you a question?

785
00:46:27,990 --> 00:46:30,910
I mean, if it's too personal,
you don't have to answer it.

786
00:46:30,990 --> 00:46:32,530
What happened?

787
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:34,740
I think...

788
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:37,330
I think I married him to get away.

789
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:39,620
Didn't like where I ended up.

790
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:40,960
What was the guy like?

791
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:43,420
It doesn't matter.
Just forget about that question.

792
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,960
Same thing happened to me
when I joined the Army.

793
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:50,140
- It's a marriage of sorts.
- On prom night. That's psychotic.

794
00:46:51,430 --> 00:46:54,310
(LAUGHING) How could you possibly
join the Army?

795
00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:58,060
It's something I felt I had to do.
I know it doesn't make any sense.

796
00:46:58,140 --> 00:46:59,560
No, it doesn't make any sense.

797
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:03,230
Do you know how much time I spent on
this masochistic cycle just trying

798
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,690
- to figure out what I'd done?
- Nothing.

799
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:08,360
Yeah, well, you tell me that now.
A little late.

800
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:11,570
And I thought you'd been murdered
or brainwashed or...

801
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:13,450
At least I'd hoped that's what happened.

802
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:15,580
Sorry to disappoint you.

803
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:19,370
So, you know, come on, spill.
What you been doing the last 10 years?

804
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:22,420
Well, you must have experiences
you wanna tell me about.

805
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:24,540
- Bad experiences.
- You've met people?

806
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:28,010
- Bad people.
- You're pathetic. Know what you need?

807
00:47:28,090 --> 00:47:29,930
- What?
- Shockabuku.

808
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:31,720
You wanna tell me what that means?

809
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:35,890
It's a swift, spiritual kick to the head
that alters your reality forever.

810
00:47:36,890 --> 00:47:38,390
That'd be good.

811
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:40,310
I think.

812
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:44,230
Listen, I could pick you
up for the reunion around 7:00.

813
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:47,610
Wait a minute. Let me get this straight.
You are asking me

814
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:51,610
- to go as your date to the reunion?
- Yes.

815
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:55,620
- It's unbelievable.
- Well, you know, what the hell?

816
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:58,120
- I'm not even planning on going.
- Really?

817
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:02,460
Really. I'm... I was just gonna be mean
about them on the radio. You know?

818
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:05,000
- Yeah, yeah.
- Besides, it's gonna be depressing.

819
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:08,510
Maybe. But listen, if you wanna go,
I can't think of any reason

820
00:48:08,590 --> 00:48:10,880
- why we wouldn't go together.
- I can.

821
00:48:10,970 --> 00:48:13,010
I think you can open up, forgive a little.

822
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:15,510
I think it'd be good for you.
I'll be on time.

823
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:18,060
Showing up would be a big step.

824
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:22,850
- Well, I'll think about it.
- Really?

825
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:25,810
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God. It's Marvin and Debi.

826
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:28,110
It's me, Amy.

827
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:29,860
- Amy.
- Yes.

828
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:31,320
You're still together?

829
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:35,320
Oh, God, you were the coolest couple.

830
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:36,620
(DRINK SPILLING)

831
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:38,200
Still are. I am so sorry.

832
00:48:38,450 --> 00:48:40,700
- That's okay. No, God.
- Here. Want my drink?

833
00:48:40,790 --> 00:48:43,790
- Don't worry about a thing.
- Debi, I love your show.

834
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:46,540
- It's so timeless.
- Yeah, it does run a little long.

835
00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:49,340
- Marvin, are you here for the reunion?
- Sure.

836
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:52,220
- Where you been these last 10 years?
- Yeah, Marv, where you been?

837
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:53,680
You look great.

838
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:56,550
- I work at Kentucky Fried Chicken.
- You do not.

839
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:59,260
I do. I sell biscuits and gravy
all over the southland.

840
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:01,810
You're so funny. He's a funny guy.

841
00:49:02,810 --> 00:49:04,350
You know Tim, my husband?

842
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:07,190
Why don't I get you another
drink and you can catch up?

843
00:49:07,270 --> 00:49:09,480
Could I have a Stoli with three olives
and an onion?

844
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,740
- Yeah.
- I'll have what she's having.

845
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:13,400
Sure.

846
00:49:18,490 --> 00:49:20,490
Hi.

847
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:29,790
Girl down there,
she doesn't trust me anymore.

848
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:31,590
I don't know why.

849
00:49:31,670 --> 00:49:33,510
I'm trying to earn back her trust.

850
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:44,350
I'm gonna go finish my drink,
walk her to the car,

851
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:46,940
I'll be at the hotel in a half hour.

852
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:48,860
I'll see you there?

853
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:56,950
- That's him.
- Yeah, we know, thank you.

854
00:49:57,030 --> 00:49:58,740
We've been following him around.

855
00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:00,450
What's the problem here?
You guys on an hourly rate?

856
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,330
If we observe the subject
in an illegal act,

857
00:50:03,410 --> 00:50:06,500
only then can we intervene
and terminate.

858
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:07,670
Yeah.

859
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:10,250
Why don't you just go
and shoot the fucker, huh?

860
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:13,250
Because we are not assassins,
Mr. Grocer.

861
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:16,380
- We work for the American government.
- Hey, he's coming back.

862
00:50:19,390 --> 00:50:21,760
(MOUTHING) He's not coming back.

863
00:50:24,890 --> 00:50:27,350
Fuck you guys.

864
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:30,610
- Hey, I don't appreciate being hosed.
- (LAUGHING)

865
00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:33,360
You're exactly the same.

866
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:34,610
So are you.

867
00:50:34,690 --> 00:50:37,280
- I am? How so?
- Just like I remembered you.

868
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:39,280
Yeah? Troubled?

869
00:50:39,410 --> 00:50:42,410
I'm troubled? Yeah. I got...
I got a few problems. Don't you?

870
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:44,160
- Sure.
- Yeah? What'd you do?

871
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:45,910
I tried everything, you know.

872
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,830
I went to the nutritionist, the herbalist,
the psychiatrist.

873
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:53,210
- That's quite a list. Any of it work?
- I can't tell, but you gotta try, you know?

874
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:55,550
- It's your duty.
- Yeah, patriot, sure, sure.

875
00:50:55,630 --> 00:50:58,470
- Yeah.
- So tell me more about your problems.

876
00:50:58,550 --> 00:51:02,140
And I'll tell you about mine
and then we'll solve them tonight.

877
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:03,220
(LAUGHS)

878
00:51:03,470 --> 00:51:05,180
Not so fast.

879
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:08,600
- You're still in the penalty box.
- Right, right, right.

880
00:51:10,270 --> 00:51:12,560
Well, thanks for coming to see me.

881
00:51:13,610 --> 00:51:17,110
- So is there a Mrs. Mysterio?
- No, but I have a very nice cat.

882
00:51:17,190 --> 00:51:18,900
- Not the same.
- You don't know my cat.

883
00:51:18,990 --> 00:51:20,360
It's very demanding.

884
00:51:20,450 --> 00:51:23,910
- It? You don't know if it's a boy or a girl?
- I respect its privacy.

885
00:51:26,950 --> 00:51:29,080
- Are you happy?
- Kind of.

886
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:31,460
- Really?
- Sort of.

887
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:33,330
We'll talk soon?

888
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:35,130
Okay.

889
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:42,140
That's a nice ride.
Nobody buys American anymore, huh?

890
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:58,110
(PHONE RINGING)

891
00:51:59,990 --> 00:52:01,320
- Hello.
- Marcella, what do you got?

892
00:52:01,410 --> 00:52:04,030
Hey, that town is hot.

893
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:06,580
I got the stink from
an assistant over at Rothschild's.

894
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:07,660
We prepped together.

895
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:10,210
I downloaded everything,
so just call it up.

896
00:52:10,290 --> 00:52:12,000
I'm online.

897
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:18,340
We've got Steven Lardner, a.k.a. Steve,

898
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:21,170
and Kenneth McCullers,
no pseudonym.

899
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:23,760
Steve was a red-shirt tailback
from Ohio State.

900
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:26,970
McCullers, all-American wrestler
from Northwestern,

901
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:29,470
- MBA from the same.
- What are they doing here?

902
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:32,390
Well, they're domestic
covert operatives for the NSA,

903
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:36,020
up there as part of
a new get-tough-on-terror campaign.

904
00:52:36,150 --> 00:52:39,230
They're looking for an Oswald,
a patsy to take the fall.

905
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:41,610
- Grocer fed them you.
- Grocer set me up?

906
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:43,200
- Surprised?
- No.

907
00:52:43,530 --> 00:52:44,950
They were supposed to
catch you in the act,

908
00:52:45,030 --> 00:52:47,450
but I guess they weren't
quick enough, right?

909
00:52:48,870 --> 00:52:52,580
- Who's the ghoul?
- Well, this guy is a badass.

910
00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:55,120
Felix La Poubelle.

911
00:52:55,210 --> 00:52:58,460
An accomplished amateur
with the Basque Nationalists.

912
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:01,090
A few odd jobs
with the Algerian separatists.

913
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:05,640
Went pro with a stunning debut
aboard an elite Caribbean cruise liner.

914
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:07,760
That's where I know him from.
He's an asshole.

915
00:53:07,850 --> 00:53:09,640
Did loan-outs for LikkenBakken.

916
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:13,980
Enjoys Native American art,
ballroom dancing, pornography...

917
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:15,690
Yeah, yeah, yeah. What is he here for?

918
00:53:15,770 --> 00:53:19,190
It's part of that Oregon snafu
with that dog, Budro.

919
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:22,530
You're gonna get out of there, right?
That's not right. You gotta get out.

920
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:25,570
- You're on a flight tonight, right?
- It isn't done.

921
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:27,990
This is not good.

922
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:30,160
I'll do it tomorrow, it's fine.

923
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,200
Sir, I'm beginning to
worry about your safety.

924
00:53:32,450 --> 00:53:33,580
Look, I have to go.

925
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:36,670
Yeah, we all have to go sometime, sir,
but we can choose when.

926
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:39,290
No one chooses when.

927
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:07,670
(WITH A JAMAICAN ACCENT)
You can't come in.

928
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:11,970
Well, I was in the neighborhood,
so I just stopped by.

929
00:55:12,050 --> 00:55:13,430
Wanted to say hi. Can I come in?

930
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:18,940
You can come in, but only for a second.

931
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:30,820
Unbelievable.

932
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:34,160
It's exactly the same.

933
00:55:34,330 --> 00:55:37,160
It's a shrine. It's only temporary.

934
00:55:37,750 --> 00:55:39,830
My apartment burned down
on Devil's Night.

935
00:55:40,210 --> 00:55:41,870
Really.

936
00:55:42,670 --> 00:55:44,460
So you never gave me an answer.

937
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:47,460
- I said we'd talk later.
- Well, this is later.

938
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:49,130
See, I figure if we go together,

939
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:51,050
we have a better chance
of getting out alive.

940
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:55,390
You know, we can partner up,
watch for traps, you know, go tandem.

941
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:57,310
I think it'd be a lot safer
than if we lone-wolfed it.

942
00:55:58,060 --> 00:56:01,190
I have to say I'm curious
as to what 10 years has done to you.

943
00:56:01,270 --> 00:56:02,400
You, too.

944
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:05,020
Is...

945
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:07,440
Is that the same bed?

946
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:08,820
Uh huh.

947
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:11,610
The magic bed.

948
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:14,740
The magic carpet. Wow.

949
00:56:17,790 --> 00:56:20,660
I'll tell you what. I'll give you an answer
if you give me an airplane.

950
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:23,170
- Okay.
- Cool.

951
00:56:24,630 --> 00:56:27,250
- Ready?
- Okay.

952
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:30,420
- Keep your feet low.
- I remember.

953
00:56:30,510 --> 00:56:32,590
It's been 10 years.

954
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:35,430
- Fly, be free, be free.
- I'm flying.

955
00:56:35,510 --> 00:56:36,680
(IN JAMAICAN ACCENT) Emancipation.

956
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:39,060
- Are you free?
- Of course. Okay.

957
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:41,230
- What if your dad comes in?
- You can give him one, too.

958
00:56:42,230 --> 00:56:44,810
Okay. You can pick me up at 7:00.

959
00:56:45,770 --> 00:56:48,860
Put me down. You can pick me up.

960
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:56,240
Okay, you can go now.

961
00:56:56,530 --> 00:56:58,080
You want me to leave right now.

962
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:01,040
You don't wanna, maybe, watch CNN,
Crossfire, something romantic?

963
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:05,580
- No, airplane was quite enough.
- Okay, I'll go. That's fine, I'll go.

964
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:07,460
But this night, tomorrow night,

965
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:11,130
the reunion is gonna be
an important step

966
00:57:11,590 --> 00:57:14,930
in our, you know,
burgeoning relationship.

967
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:17,260
You're a fucking psycho.

968
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:20,260
Don't rush to judgment
on something like that

969
00:57:20,350 --> 00:57:22,100
until all the facts are in.

970
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,640
- I'll just let myself out.
- Go.

971
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:28,150
And, you can, you know,
lock the door behind me,

972
00:57:28,270 --> 00:57:30,900
because, you know,
a lot of undesirables around.

973
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:33,400
I'll call you. I'll go.

974
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:45,080
Oh, shit, there he is.

975
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:52,670
Man, why don't we just do his job
so we can do our job

976
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:54,130
and get the fuck out of here?

977
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:56,720
What do you mean do his job?

978
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:58,930
What am I, a cold-blooded killer?
I'm not a cold-blooded killer.

979
00:57:59,010 --> 00:58:01,430
- Now, wait a minute...
- No, you wait a minute.

980
00:58:02,390 --> 00:58:05,180
You wanna kill the good guy,
but not be the bad guy.

981
00:58:05,270 --> 00:58:09,440
Doesn't work like that. You gotta wait
until the bad guy kills the good guy,

982
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,940
then when you kill the bad guy,
you're the good guy.

983
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:15,110
So just to clarify,

984
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,950
if we do his job, we're the bad guys.

985
00:58:18,030 --> 00:58:20,620
And if we do our job,
we're the good guys?

986
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:24,660
- Yes.
- That's great.

987
00:58:24,830 --> 00:58:26,000
(BOTH LAUGH)

988
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:28,040
Hey, hey.

989
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:32,500
Hi, Mr. Grocer.

990
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:37,380
He's brown-bagging it today.

991
00:58:53,230 --> 00:58:54,650
Easy there, chief.

992
00:58:56,610 --> 00:58:58,860
I don't see "Hollow-point wound care"
on the menu.

993
00:58:58,950 --> 00:59:01,410
Up, up, up.

994
00:59:02,410 --> 00:59:04,790
What are you in Detroit for?
The Red Wings need a new goon?

995
00:59:05,370 --> 00:59:08,620
Hi, my name is Melanie. Let me
tell you about some of our specials.

996
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:12,500
Today there's the Alfalfa on My Mind.
That's our featured omelet.

997
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:14,550
Or there's Gatsby's West Egg Omelet.

998
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:16,420
If in the mood for something different,

999
00:59:16,510 --> 00:59:18,720
there's the
I Left My Heart in San Francheezie.

1000
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:20,930
- What'll you have?
- Two poached eggs.

1001
00:59:21,010 --> 00:59:23,970
Scrape off the milky white stuff.
Hash browns well done.

1002
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:25,770
English muffin for the bread,
and a coffee.

1003
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:28,600
Wholegrain pancakes
and an egg-white omelet, please.

1004
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:30,190
What would you like in your omelet?

1005
00:59:30,270 --> 00:59:33,230
- Nothing in the omelet.
- That's not technically an omelet.

1006
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:35,110
I don't wanna get in
a semantic argument.

1007
00:59:35,190 --> 00:59:37,240
I just want the protein, all right?

1008
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:40,200
Come on there, ice man, live a little.

1009
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:42,450
Let Chef put a little cilantro
for your liver.

1010
00:59:42,530 --> 00:59:44,950
- I don't want that.
- Little onions for the blood.

1011
00:59:46,450 --> 00:59:49,080
- What are those?
- Nutrients.

1012
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:53,210
Here's the new stuff, kid. Durazac 15.

1013
00:59:53,290 --> 00:59:55,710
Makes Prozac feel like a decaf latte.

1014
00:59:56,130 --> 00:59:59,170
- You want a couple? I got jars.
- I don't do that stuff anymore.

1015
00:59:59,260 --> 01:00:02,800
No wonder you got the shakes.
Don't say "do it," because I don't "do it."

1016
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:05,550
I ingest it on orders
from my neurophysiologist.

1017
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:08,680
It's legal. In five years,
they'll be putting it in the water

1018
01:00:08,770 --> 01:00:10,730
- for the citizens, like fluoride.
- Fascinating.

1019
01:00:10,810 --> 01:00:12,140
Is there anything
you wanted to talk about?

1020
01:00:12,230 --> 01:00:13,850
I was gonna have breakfast.

1021
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:16,610
I heard about
that little blow-up at the Ultimart.

1022
01:00:16,690 --> 01:00:19,280
- It was a wicked, ripping shame.
- One of your fraternal brothers?

1023
01:00:19,490 --> 01:00:20,530
No.

1024
01:00:20,860 --> 01:00:24,240
Hey, listen, I wanna work with you.
That was some indie frog.

1025
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:27,160
Some Basque whacker
from the Pyrenees.

1026
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:29,830
You sure Oregon doesn't ring a bell?

1027
01:00:30,410 --> 01:00:33,000
Pacific Northwest,
a couple of months ago?

1028
01:00:33,790 --> 01:00:36,290
Something about you doing
some wonder dog named Cujo?

1029
01:00:36,460 --> 01:00:37,460
(SCOFFS)

1030
01:00:37,670 --> 01:00:41,380
- Budro. Yes, Budro. Jesus Christ.
- Those dogs.

1031
01:00:41,470 --> 01:00:44,340
Yeah, I was out there trying to whack
these three junk-bond fuckos.

1032
01:00:44,430 --> 01:00:48,060
And these idiots were flushing game
with sticks of dynamite.

1033
01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:51,020
And the dog that they borrowed,
little Budro, was a retriever. Get it?

1034
01:00:51,890 --> 01:00:54,310
Budro was never a target.
Budro was acting on instinct.

1035
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,810
I would never hurt an animal.
I'm offended at the accusation.

1036
01:00:56,900 --> 01:01:00,030
Whoa, Chatty Cathy, clip your string.
I don't need to know.

1037
01:01:00,150 --> 01:01:01,530
But just for the record,
here's what I heard.

1038
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:05,110
The marks borrowed
your client's prized hunting pup.

1039
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:08,620
So bad luck for Budro,
and bad luck for Blank.

1040
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:11,830
Poodle pumper. Hound hitter.

1041
01:01:11,910 --> 01:01:14,960
- Pooch puncher.
- Let's not talk about Budro, huh?

1042
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:17,630
What about those two guys
in a Caprice Classic outside?

1043
01:01:17,710 --> 01:01:20,300
The word is you turned
two governments on me, you turncoat.

1044
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:21,420
- Me?
- You.

1045
01:01:21,510 --> 01:01:24,220
- Go G? On you? Never.
- Yes. Yes.

1046
01:01:25,930 --> 01:01:28,350
Listen. Why don't we
get our relationship straight?

1047
01:01:28,430 --> 01:01:31,310
I didn't get into this business
to have any relationships.

1048
01:01:31,390 --> 01:01:34,440
I don't wanna join your goddamn union,
all right?

1049
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:37,360
Loner. Lone gunman. Get it?
That's the whole point.

1050
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:39,440
I like the lifestyle, the image.
Look at the way I dress.

1051
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:43,650
Become a cop or something.
Have coffee in the morning with friends.

1052
01:01:43,740 --> 01:01:45,150
Look, this is a one-on-one business.

1053
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:48,950
The minute you start relationships,
bad things start happening.

1054
01:01:49,030 --> 01:01:52,500
If it'll make you feel any better,
I think this is my last job.

1055
01:01:52,910 --> 01:01:55,500
- I believe that.
- What do you say we put away our guns

1056
01:01:55,580 --> 01:01:57,920
and forget the whole goddamn thing
and have some breakfast, all right?

1057
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:04,800
No scabs. From now on,
all arrangements, all contracts,

1058
01:02:04,930 --> 01:02:07,390
- all engagements are regulated. Got it?
- Meet the new boss.

1059
01:02:07,470 --> 01:02:09,100
- Yes.
- No deal.

1060
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:12,600
Okay. But we're not gonna let you
do your little job here.

1061
01:02:12,930 --> 01:02:14,020
- No?
- No,

1062
01:02:14,100 --> 01:02:15,770
- because we're gonna do it for you.
- Is that right?

1063
01:02:15,850 --> 01:02:17,810
After we do your job, we do another job.

1064
01:02:18,060 --> 01:02:19,150
Tell me about it.

1065
01:02:19,230 --> 01:02:21,110
I'm gonna put a bullet hole in your head.

1066
01:02:21,190 --> 01:02:23,610
- I'm gonna fuck the brain hole.
- Nice talk, sugar mouth.

1067
01:02:25,650 --> 01:02:27,660
- Hi.
- You had the not-a-omelet.

1068
01:02:28,070 --> 01:02:29,950
(PLATES CRASHING)

1069
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:32,280
(HOOTING)

1070
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:41,960
(PHONE RINGING)

1071
01:02:43,090 --> 01:02:44,210
Pacific Trident Global.

1072
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:45,460
Marcella, Oatman's
not returning my calls.

1073
01:02:45,550 --> 01:02:47,430
I need you to find him right now.

1074
01:02:47,510 --> 01:02:51,140
Try his office, try the car, try his club,
but I need you to find him.

1075
01:02:51,220 --> 01:02:53,010
I'm already late for the reunion. Okay?

1076
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:54,720
- Okay.
- Patch him through the landline.

1077
01:02:54,810 --> 01:02:57,230
- This thing's low on batteries.
- All right.

1078
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:04,900
Hi, how are you? Yeah.

1079
01:03:04,990 --> 01:03:08,450
I'm a pet psychiatrist. Yeah, yeah.

1080
01:03:08,530 --> 01:03:11,070
I sell couch insurance.

1081
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:14,200
And I test-market positive thinking.

1082
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:17,960
And I lead a weekend men's group.
We specialize in ritual killings.

1083
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:22,630
Yeah, you look great. God, yeah.
Yeah, hi, how are you?

1084
01:03:22,710 --> 01:03:25,090
Yeah, how are you doing?
How are you? Good, hi.

1085
01:03:25,170 --> 01:03:27,630
Hi, I'm Martin Blank, you remember me?

1086
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:31,430
I'm not married, I don't have any kids,

1087
01:03:31,510 --> 01:03:34,720
and I'd blow your head off
if someone paid me enough.

1088
01:03:45,070 --> 01:03:48,280
Oatman, listen, don't hang up.

1089
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:50,740
I didn't kill anyone.
Except some guy tried to kill me.

1090
01:03:50,820 --> 01:03:53,530
If I see that guy again,
I'm gonna kill him, but not anyone else.

1091
01:03:53,660 --> 01:03:56,200
Except the guy I was sent here to kill.
Anyway, I saw Debi.

1092
01:03:56,290 --> 01:03:59,580
I'm on my way to the reunion with Debi.
I'm anxious, I wanna do a phoner.

1093
01:03:59,660 --> 01:04:03,630
Okay. Repeat after me.
"I am at home with the me.

1094
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:06,550
"I am rooted in the me
who is on this adventure."

1095
01:04:06,710 --> 01:04:09,720
I am at home with the me. I am rooted
in the me who is on this adventure.

1096
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:14,260
Good. Now take a deep breath
and realize that this is me breathing.

1097
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:16,350
I'm sorry, I'm confused.
I don't understand.

1098
01:04:16,430 --> 01:04:18,060
You want me to say it, or to realize it?

1099
01:04:18,230 --> 01:04:19,770
- What?
- That I'm breathing.

1100
01:04:19,890 --> 01:04:23,060
- Say it.
- This is me breathing.

1101
01:04:23,230 --> 01:04:25,400
Good. Now go do that
for about 20 minutes.

1102
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:26,980
- All right, I gotta go.
- Okay.

1103
01:04:27,070 --> 01:04:28,690
Keep it up. Don't kill anybody.

1104
01:04:29,070 --> 01:04:30,690
Right.

1105
01:04:40,620 --> 01:04:42,580
This is me breathing.

1106
01:04:46,750 --> 01:04:48,710
Yeah.

1107
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:53,880
You're a handsome devil.
What's your name?

1108
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:10,940
This is not happening again.

1109
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:53,150
Flowers.

1110
01:05:54,150 --> 01:05:56,820
- That's funny.
- As long as I get the laugh.

1111
01:06:01,450 --> 01:06:04,410
Debi, you look beautiful.

1112
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:07,500
Yeah? Thanks. Okay.

1113
01:06:08,210 --> 01:06:10,170
Hold on.

1114
01:06:11,340 --> 01:06:13,260
My dad's down the hall.
He's dying to say hi to you.

1115
01:06:13,340 --> 01:06:14,420
Sure.

1116
01:06:14,510 --> 01:06:16,130
I'll go put these in
some rubbing alcohol.

1117
01:06:16,220 --> 01:06:17,800
Great.

1118
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:30,110
Mr. Newberry, it's Martin Blank.

1119
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:35,860
Good evening. How are you?

1120
01:06:35,990 --> 01:06:38,570
- Good evening, Mr. Blank.
- Sir.

1121
01:06:38,660 --> 01:06:40,620
You've beaten the millennia.
I lose my bet.

1122
01:06:40,700 --> 01:06:43,290
Yeah, it was completely
unavoidable, sir, so...

1123
01:06:43,370 --> 01:06:45,950
Just wanted to say hello, and,
you know, ask you how you are.

1124
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:47,870
- Martin.
- How's business, tricks?

1125
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:48,960
I don't know where you've been

1126
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:51,460
since you abandoned my daughter
10 years ago,

1127
01:06:51,590 --> 01:06:55,090
and I don't care. It's good that you left.
I'm glad that you did.

1128
01:06:56,590 --> 01:06:57,720
You've grown up a bit.

1129
01:06:59,220 --> 01:07:01,260
Did I have you figured wrong?

1130
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:03,350
Well, I don't know. I mean, I hope so.

1131
01:07:03,850 --> 01:07:05,270
I visualized you in a haze,

1132
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:07,810
as one of those slackster,
flannel-wearing,

1133
01:07:07,890 --> 01:07:10,850
coffee-house misanthropes
I've been seeing in Newsweek.

1134
01:07:10,940 --> 01:07:13,150
No, no, no, I went the other road.

1135
01:07:13,230 --> 01:07:16,150
Six figures.
Doing business with lead-pipe cruelty.

1136
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:18,150
Mercenary sensibility, you know?

1137
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:20,490
Sports, sex,
no real relationships with anybody.

1138
01:07:20,570 --> 01:07:22,070
How have the years been treating you?

1139
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:25,740
Well, you know me, Martin, the same
old sellout. Exploiting the oppressed.

1140
01:07:25,870 --> 01:07:26,910
Sure.

1141
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:30,500
"What a piece of work is man
How noble..."

1142
01:07:30,750 --> 01:07:32,000
Fuck it.

1143
01:07:32,090 --> 01:07:33,750
Let's have a drink
and forget the whole thing.

1144
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:35,670
I'd love to, but we're a little bit late.

1145
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:38,300
So I just wanted to say hello
and wish you the best.

1146
01:07:38,430 --> 01:07:40,470
What have you been doing
with your life?

1147
01:07:42,470 --> 01:07:43,850
Professional killer.

1148
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:48,480
Good for you. It's a growth industry.

1149
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:54,110
Okay, good seeing you again.

1150
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:17,590
Neutralize. Did I say neutralize?

1151
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:19,470
I'll give you 20 bucks for that.

1152
01:08:20,130 --> 01:08:22,840
STEVEN: Okay, he's definitely fallen
for her.

1153
01:08:23,390 --> 01:08:26,260
- Look at him.
- Her hair looks really nice.

1154
01:08:26,350 --> 01:08:27,390
Yeah, it does, doesn't it?

1155
01:08:28,980 --> 01:08:33,270
No, he's using her.
What a cruel bastard.

1156
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:35,900
I'm gonna enjoy killing
that son of a bitch.

1157
01:08:35,980 --> 01:08:37,650
Me, too.

1158
01:08:37,820 --> 01:08:40,490
- I should've worn a skirt.
- I should've brought my gun.

1159
01:08:40,650 --> 01:08:43,360
- What?
- Should be fun.

1160
01:08:47,490 --> 01:08:49,870
- I'm not going.
- I'll go.

1161
01:08:57,050 --> 01:08:59,670
Welcome back, Pointers.
It's Arlene Oslott-Joseph.

1162
01:09:00,090 --> 01:09:03,510
- Hi. How are you?
- Hi. I'm good.

1163
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:06,890
- Martin. Blank.
- Martin Blank.

1164
01:09:07,060 --> 01:09:10,930
Yes, why, you haven't changed a bit.

1165
01:09:11,020 --> 01:09:13,140
- Don't say that.
- Hi, Debi.

1166
01:09:13,350 --> 01:09:16,810
- Just love your show.
- Thanks. Well, you're our demographic.

1167
01:09:16,900 --> 01:09:20,440
- You gone and got married, Arlene.
- Yes, I did, and three children.

1168
01:09:20,530 --> 01:09:22,950
- It's really neat.
- Yeah.

1169
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:24,780
I had the yearbook pictures put on,

1170
01:09:24,860 --> 01:09:27,070
so everybody knows
who everybody was.

1171
01:09:27,330 --> 01:09:29,030
A special torture.

1172
01:09:30,580 --> 01:09:34,540
- Yeah. Hi, it's Arlene Oslott-Joseph.
- Oh, well.

1173
01:09:34,710 --> 01:09:38,340
Bye-bye now, kids. Hi. Now, let's see.

1174
01:09:39,050 --> 01:09:42,050
- Who needs hard liquor?
- Me. How are you holding up?

1175
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:43,880
- A little shaky.
- Straight to the bar for us.

1176
01:09:44,220 --> 01:09:46,840
- I'm starting to remember these faces.
- What can I get you?

1177
01:09:46,930 --> 01:09:48,550
- Vodka rocks, double. Two.
- You bet.

1178
01:09:49,390 --> 01:09:50,930
When do we start relating to anybody?

1179
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:54,060
I would say, any moment now.
Ken Alderosh.

1180
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:56,900
- Hey, hello, Martin.
- Hi, Ken.

1181
01:09:56,980 --> 01:09:59,770
- Hi, yeah, super. Hi, Debi, how are you?
- Hey, Ken. How are you?

1182
01:09:59,900 --> 01:10:02,780
- Isn't this great?
- Yeah. What's been happening?

1183
01:10:02,940 --> 01:10:04,820
- Moss, Bryce and Fromeyer.
- Yeah?

1184
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:09,320
In divorce mainly, some property,
some personal injury, you know.

1185
01:10:09,410 --> 01:10:10,910
Those all seem kind of related.

1186
01:10:11,160 --> 01:10:12,160
(LAUGHING) Hey!

1187
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:13,500
Hey, I'm gonna use that.

1188
01:10:13,580 --> 01:10:15,040
- I'll take that line.
- Sure.

1189
01:10:15,370 --> 01:10:17,580
Hey, let me give you a card here.
Wait a second.

1190
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:22,090
Actually, I've got a special one here
for top-shelf clients.

1191
01:10:22,210 --> 01:10:24,510
- Don't forget to read the cap.
- Thanks a lot.

1192
01:10:24,590 --> 01:10:26,680
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Sure, sure.

1193
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:28,760
Martin Blank...

1194
01:10:28,970 --> 01:10:31,310
- Sorry, man, you slipped. Sorry.
- Take it easy, man.

1195
01:10:31,430 --> 01:10:34,640
- Sorry, sorry.
- Hey, Martin, what's happening, man?

1196
01:10:34,730 --> 01:10:36,560
- It's Nathaniel.
- Hi, yeah, sure.

1197
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:38,850
How's it going, man?
Hi, Debi. How you doing?

1198
01:10:38,940 --> 01:10:41,610
- Yeah, still very Newberry, I see.
- Oldberry, I think.

1199
01:10:41,730 --> 01:10:42,900
- How's it going, man?
- Good.

1200
01:10:42,980 --> 01:10:45,070
Come and say hey to Eckhart.
He's right over here.

1201
01:10:45,150 --> 01:10:48,360
- Hey, thanks for the pen.
- You remember Jimbo and Peanut?

1202
01:10:48,660 --> 01:10:50,660
- Hey.
- Hey, man.

1203
01:10:50,740 --> 01:10:53,490
- How's it going?
- They're good. They're big, real big.

1204
01:10:53,580 --> 01:10:55,870
I'm supervising their training, man.
They're going pro.

1205
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:59,670
Strictly Greco-Roman, man, all torso.
I'm taking them on the wrestling circuit.

1206
01:10:59,830 --> 01:11:02,380
Yeah. Hey, I got something
for you guys.

1207
01:11:02,460 --> 01:11:04,130
I don't hear any real remorse here.

1208
01:11:04,210 --> 01:11:07,170
I don't think you should
get back together with this guy.

1209
01:11:07,260 --> 01:11:09,550
- Real, man. You were real, man.
- That was cold, man.

1210
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:12,050
I don't mean any offense.
I was speaking from the heart.

1211
01:11:12,140 --> 01:11:14,010
- All right.
- What are you doing later?

1212
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:16,060
We're gonna go outside
and blow a fat one.

1213
01:11:16,140 --> 01:11:18,190
Get charred and toasted,
just like in high school.

1214
01:11:18,270 --> 01:11:20,270
We gotta go see somebody over there.

1215
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:23,980
- We'll come back and get toasted.
- Come back, have a drink. Later, man.

1216
01:11:25,820 --> 01:11:27,990
- How are you?
- Great.

1217
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:30,530
- What happened?
- I was just telling him.

1218
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:33,910
It was like I was
sucked up into the cosmos,

1219
01:11:33,990 --> 01:11:38,540
all the while surrounded by
these yowling, nebulous forms.

1220
01:11:38,710 --> 01:11:42,630
- Pardon me?
- And then, I got to the threshold.

1221
01:11:42,790 --> 01:11:47,840
(CHOKING UP) Mozart, music,
flowers and poetry.

1222
01:11:48,340 --> 01:11:50,260
- You died?
- And came back.

1223
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:52,680
See, that's the beautiful part.

1224
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:54,010
How did you die?

1225
01:11:54,510 --> 01:11:58,140
I lost it on some ice
and ended up in Lake Saint Clair. Yeah.

1226
01:11:59,350 --> 01:12:01,440
- Wanna go somewhere else?
- Sure.

1227
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:04,020
- Maybe we can dance later.
- Okay, sure.

1228
01:12:04,110 --> 01:12:05,610
Okay, bye.

1229
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:09,440
Hey, you know, I'm gonna go
say hello to Amy over there.

1230
01:12:09,530 --> 01:12:11,530
- Okay.
- Okay.

1231
01:12:14,370 --> 01:12:17,160
- Governor. How you holding up, baby?
- I don't know. How are you?

1232
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:19,250
Can't believe you haven't
cracked like a piñata.

1233
01:12:19,370 --> 01:12:20,620
- Almost.
- You look good.

1234
01:12:20,710 --> 01:12:22,830
- You look Tony Robbins good.
- So do you, man.

1235
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:25,880
- How's that possible?
- I know, I know.

1236
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:27,550
Excuse me.

1237
01:12:27,630 --> 01:12:28,800
- Martin Blank.
- Hi.

1238
01:12:29,090 --> 01:12:32,970
- You look great. It's Jenny Slater.
- Jenny Slater, yeah. How are you?

1239
01:12:33,050 --> 01:12:37,060
- This 10 years has been good for you.
- It's been good for you, too.

1240

- Paul?
- Yeah.

1243
01:12:43,690 --> 01:12:47,570
Had 11 classes with you.
Did the precious metals paper for you.

1244
01:12:47,690 --> 01:12:48,940
Oh.

1245
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:52,490
Okay. Well, I was looking
for some validation of my life,

1246
01:12:52,570 --> 01:12:53,910
but apparently it came up short.

1247
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:56,320
- I thought that went well.
- It was good for you.

1248
01:12:56,410 --> 01:12:58,490
- They said...
- How's the rest of the night been?

1249
01:12:58,580 --> 01:13:00,080
It's been great. It's a festival of pain.

1250
01:13:00,460 --> 01:13:03,080
The idea that they think
that you can't evolve.

1251
01:13:03,210 --> 01:13:05,460
- But I'm saying that I...
- Excuse me.

Hey, Jenny. Jenny.

- Blank, Blank, Blank.
- Yeah.

in the club years ago.

1257
01:13:16,930 --> 01:13:19,180
I don't wanna talk about the old days.
What did we have?

1258
01:13:19,270 --> 01:13:21,220
- Archery.
- I couldn't stand that class.

1259
01:13:21,310 --> 01:13:23,640
I appreciate you helping me...
Helping me hit my targets.

1260
01:13:23,730 --> 01:13:24,850
- Sure.
- Check this out.

1261
01:13:24,940 --> 01:13:29,150

- How are you?
- I'm all right.

1266
01:13:37,410 --> 01:13:38,580
So sit.

1267
01:13:38,660 --> 01:13:41,080
So how you been?

1268
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:42,620
Great, I'm... I'm married.

1269

- And...
- Robbie.

1270
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:47,330
- Yeah.
- And how is it all?

1271
01:13:47,420 --> 01:13:48,880
It's not like it was supposed to be, right?

1272
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:50,420
No, no, that's not true.

1273
01:13:50,510 --> 01:13:51,670
- No?
- It's great.

1274
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:53,630
- Really?
- I'm so great.

1275

People think that when you get married
you lose your freedom.

1276

- Not true?
- No, it gets better and better.

1277
01:14:00,310 --> 01:14:02,060
So how are you?

1278
01:14:02,140 --> 01:14:04,180
How's your life?

1279
01:14:04,270 --> 01:14:05,810
- In progress.
- Yeah?

1280
01:14:08,270 --> 01:14:09,770
- Will you hold Robbie for a sec?
- No, I...

1281
01:14:09,860 --> 01:14:11,690
I'm gonna get his bottle. It's okay.

1282
01:14:12,150 --> 01:14:13,740
Go ahead.

1283
01:14:13,820 --> 01:14:15,990
You won't break him.

1284
01:14:16,410 --> 01:14:19,490
You spend the first year just trying
to keep these little guys alive.

1285
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:22,450
Yeah, I imagine they'd be
very vulnerable to the elements.

1286
01:14:22,540 --> 01:14:23,540
Yeah.

I know.

No, no, he'd love it.

- How you doing?

- I didn't get a chance to talk.

- Yes, I did.

Did I tell you that?

Yeah, well, you know,
no less than you deserve.

01:16:42,090 --> 01:16:46,970
I think... I think I was overly harsh
when I said that you were broken.

01:16:47,060 --> 01:16:50,060
Really? How so?

1331

I don't think you're broken.

No?

1333

- I think you're mildly sprained.
- What?

- Nothing that can't be mended.
- Wow.

01:19:45,650 --> 01:19:47,820
Something's missing.

1370
01:19:47,990 --> 01:19:51,320
- Something.
- What?

1371
01:19:51,490 --> 01:19:53,200
I know.

1372
01:19:54,830 --> 01:19:57,000
Welcome home.

1373
01:20:00,620 --> 01:20:02,830
I missed you.

1374
01:20:13,550 --> 01:20:14,850
Welcome back, Pointer.

1375
01:20:14,930 --> 01:20:17,180
It's Arlene Oslott-Joseph.

1376
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:18,810
And who might you be?

1377
01:20:18,980 --> 01:20:21,020
It is I, Sidney Feldman.

1378
01:20:22,350 --> 01:20:24,360
Oh. Been overseas?

1379
01:20:27,190 --> 01:20:30,200
My, you have changed. (LAUGHS)

1380
01:20:34,030 --> 01:20:36,450
Save a dance for me, now.

1381
01:20:49,010 --> 01:20:50,970
I think the best thing
would be to go away

1382
01:20:51,050 --> 01:20:52,130
someplace quiet for a few weeks

1383
01:20:52,220 --> 01:20:54,550
and work this whole thing out.

1384
01:20:58,350 --> 01:20:59,430
Where are you going?

1385
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:02,060
Well, you know, there's a few people
I should say goodbye to.

1386
01:21:04,900 --> 01:21:09,190
I'm gonna go cruise by my old locker
and then I'll meet you in front.

1387
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:11,240
I'll find you.

1388
01:21:15,700 --> 01:21:17,080
(CHUCKLING)

1389
01:21:22,460 --> 01:21:25,380
- Hi, Bob.
- Debi Newberry, huh?

1390
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:27,500
You gonna hit that shit again?

1391
01:21:27,590 --> 01:21:29,090
Fine, Bob, how are you?

1392
01:21:30,380 --> 01:21:32,010
Real smart.

1393
01:21:32,680 --> 01:21:34,380
Come on.

1394
01:21:34,510 --> 01:21:37,010
Let's see how smart you are
with my foot up your ass.

1395
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:39,680
Do you really believe

1396
01:21:39,770 --> 01:21:43,270
that there's some stored-up conflict
that exists between us?

1397
01:21:44,730 --> 01:21:46,440
There is no "us."

1398
01:21:46,610 --> 01:21:49,440
"We" don't exist.

1399
01:21:49,650 --> 01:21:51,320
So who do you wanna hit, man?

1400
01:21:51,490 --> 01:21:53,490
It's not me.

1401
01:21:55,990 --> 01:21:57,870
What do you wanna do here, man?

1402
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:04,620
I don't know what that is.

1403
01:22:04,790 --> 01:22:06,120
These are my words.

1404
01:22:06,290 --> 01:22:07,420
It's a poem?

1405
01:22:08,590 --> 01:22:11,460
See, that's the prob...
Express yourself, Bob.

1406
01:22:11,630 --> 01:22:13,130
Go for it.

1407
01:22:13,300 --> 01:22:15,430
"When I feel quiet

1408
01:22:17,510 --> 01:22:21,260
"When I feel blue..."

1409
01:22:22,470 --> 01:22:26,390
You know, I think that is terrific,
what you have right there.

1410
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:28,480
Really, I like that a lot.
I wouldn't sell the...

1411
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:29,860
I wouldn't sell
the dealership or anything,

1412
01:22:29,940 --> 01:22:31,820
but I'm telling you, it's intense.

1413
01:22:32,150 --> 01:22:33,740
- There's more.
- Okay.

1414
01:22:33,820 --> 01:22:37,490
- Why don't you just skip to the end?
- To the very end?

1415
01:22:39,700 --> 01:22:41,830
"For a while"

1416
01:22:42,330 --> 01:22:44,660
That's good, man.

1417
01:22:45,290 --> 01:22:47,170
- "For a while"
- That's excellent.

1418
01:22:47,250 --> 01:22:50,380
- You wanna do some blow?
- No, I don't.

1419
01:22:54,050 --> 01:22:55,340
There you go.

1420
01:22:55,510 --> 01:22:57,550
- I missed you.
- Okay. I missed you, too.

1421
01:22:59,850 --> 01:23:00,970
Okay.

1422

(GROANING)

1423
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:24,360
It's not me.

01:25:28,790 --> 01:25:30,620
It wasn't me.

1425
01:25:33,670 --> 01:25:35,330
Hey, what's going on?
What's going on?

1426
01:25:35,420 --> 01:25:38,920
- Where's our boy?
- No.

1427
01:25:45,050 --> 01:25:48,970
Hey, is that, is that his...
That guy's blood?

1428
01:25:49,640 --> 01:25:50,810
Yeah.

1429

A thousand innocent people
get killed every day.

1430
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:55,190
Is this guy dead?

1431
01:25:55,350 --> 01:25:58,730
But a millionaire's pet gets detonated
and you're marked for life.

1432
01:26:02,150 --> 01:26:04,360
Help me out here.

1433
01:26:06,370 --> 01:26:08,370
Pull that down.

1434
01:26:12,160 --> 01:26:14,210
How did he die?

1435
01:26:14,410 --> 01:26:17,710
He's a notorious terrorist.
There's a contract out on my life.

1436
01:26:21,550 --> 01:26:22,670
- He's dead?
- He's dead.

1437
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:24,380
- He's dead?
- Yeah.

1438
01:26:24,970 --> 01:26:27,090
Are his feet covered?

1439
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:33,060
Here we go.

1440
01:26:33,270 --> 01:26:36,140
Come on. Grab his feet.

- What can I get you?
- Whiskey.

1452

Club soda.

1453

this is Dr. Oatman.

1471
01:29:36,410 --> 01:29:37,780
I am not available right now,

1472
01:29:37,950 --> 01:29:41,540
but if you'd like to leave a message,
I will get back to you shortly.

1473
01:29:42,540 --> 01:29:44,460
Dr. Oatman, it's Martin Blank.

1474
01:29:44,540 --> 01:29:46,880
I want to tell you
I don't wanna work with you anymore.

1475

Things are going well here,
better than expected,

1476
01:29:49,340 --> 01:29:52,260
and I just don't really feel
like you're helpful in any way.

1477
01:29:52,340 --> 01:29:54,180
I don't think you're serious
about the therapy.

1478
01:29:54,260 --> 01:29:58,720
And so I want you to take a deep breath

1479
01:29:58,810 --> 01:30:02,770
and realize that this is me firing you.

He was gonna kill you, right?

1482
01:30:43,100 --> 01:30:44,730
Yes.

1483
01:30:46,190 --> 01:30:47,650
It wasn't the other way around?

1484
01:30:47,730 --> 01:30:48,850
No, no.

1485
01:30:49,190 --> 01:30:50,650
That wasn't my intention.

1486
01:30:50,730 --> 01:30:53,110
Is it something you've done?

1487
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:56,150
It's something I do

1488
01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:58,160
professionally,

1489
01:30:58,320 --> 01:31:01,030
for about five years now.

1490
01:31:02,200 --> 01:31:03,540
You were joking.

1491
01:31:03,700 --> 01:31:06,080
People joke about the horrible things
that they don't do.

1492
01:31:06,250 --> 01:31:08,500
They don't do them. It's absurd.

1493
01:31:08,670 --> 01:31:10,170
When I left, I joined the Army.

1494
01:31:10,340 --> 01:31:11,670
And when I took the service exam,

1495
01:31:11,840 --> 01:31:13,880
my psych profile fit a certain...

1496
01:31:13,960 --> 01:31:16,880
Moral flexibility would be
the only way to describe it.

1497
01:31:17,130 --> 01:31:20,090
I was loaned out
to a CIA-sponsored program.

1498
01:31:20,260 --> 01:31:22,680
And we sort of found each other.
That's the way it works.

1499
01:31:22,850 --> 01:31:26,020
- So, you... You're a government spook?
- Yes... I mean no.

1500
01:31:26,100 --> 01:31:28,190
I was before, but I'm not now.

1501
01:31:28,440 --> 01:31:30,150
But that's all irrelevant really.

1502
01:31:30,230 --> 01:31:32,900
The idea of governments, nations,
is public-relations theory.

1503
01:31:32,980 --> 01:31:35,440
I don't want the theories.
I wanna hear about the dead people.

1504
01:31:35,530 --> 01:31:37,990
Explain the dead people.

1505
01:31:38,070 --> 01:31:39,700
Who do you kill?

1506
01:31:39,780 --> 01:31:41,280
Well, that's very complicated,

1507
01:31:41,370 --> 01:31:43,370
but in the beginning, you know,
it matters,

1508
01:31:43,540 --> 01:31:46,040
of course, that you have something
to hang onto,

1509
01:31:46,120 --> 01:31:48,460
you know, a specific ideology
to defend, right?

1510
01:31:48,540 --> 01:31:51,080
I mean, taming unchecked aggression,
that was my personal favorite.

1511
01:31:51,170 --> 01:31:52,710
Others liked "live free or die."

1512
01:31:52,790 --> 01:31:53,840
But you get the idea.

1513
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:55,840
But that's all bullshit
and I know that now.

1514
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:57,880
You do it
because you were trained to do it,

1515
01:31:57,970 --> 01:31:59,260
you were encouraged to do it,

1516
01:31:59,340 --> 01:32:04,310
and ultimately, you know,
you get to like it.

1517
01:32:07,180 --> 01:32:09,730
I know that sounds bad.

1518
01:32:10,940 --> 01:32:12,270
You're a psychopath.

1519
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:14,860
No, no, no.
A psychopath kills for no reason.

1520
01:32:14,940 --> 01:32:18,070
I kill for money.
It's a job. That didn't sound right.

1521
01:32:18,150 --> 01:32:20,360
Let me see if I can put it another way.

1522
01:32:20,530 --> 01:32:24,030
If I show up at your door, chances are
you did something to bring me there.

1523
01:32:24,740 --> 01:32:26,910
Everybody's doing it.
It's like the natural order.

1524
01:32:27,040 --> 01:32:29,710
I mean, the states do it.
Sometimes there's due process

1525
01:32:29,790 --> 01:32:32,540
and sometimes pilots
