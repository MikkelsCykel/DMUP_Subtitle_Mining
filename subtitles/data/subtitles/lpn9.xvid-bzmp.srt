00:02:56,307 --> 00:02:57,740
About once a month,

44
00:02:57,808 --> 00:02:59,742
my friends and I
get together

45
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:02,176
and do something different
for fun.

46
00:03:02,246 --> 00:03:03,679
Sometimes
we go bowling

47
00:03:03,747 --> 00:03:05,146
or miniature golf

48
00:03:05,216 --> 00:03:07,150
or a movie
or something.

49
00:03:07,218 --> 00:03:08,242
One night,

50
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,220
we went down
to a Gypsy palm reader

51
00:03:11,322 --> 00:03:13,256
on 34th and Vine.

52
00:03:17,895 --> 00:03:19,829
Let me see
your palm.

53
00:03:41,652 --> 00:03:44,621
You do very badly
with women.

54
00:03:45,689 --> 00:03:48,556
No. I... I... I...
I do all right.

55
00:03:48,626 --> 00:03:50,059
No, you don't.

56
00:03:50,127 --> 00:03:52,061
There are
no women here.

57
00:03:55,566 --> 00:03:56,897
What's this?

58
00:04:00,638 --> 00:04:01,570
No women.

59
00:04:02,573 --> 00:04:04,632
Are you
a boy-kissy-boy?

60
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:06,733
Excuse me?

61
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:08,334
You a homosexual?

62
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,579
No.

63
00:04:11,649 --> 00:04:14,584
I want my sister
to see this.

64
00:04:23,661 --> 00:04:25,094
No, I don't.

65
00:04:25,162 --> 00:04:26,094
No.

66
00:04:26,163 --> 00:04:29,098
I see no women
in your life

67
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:31,498
for a long,
long time.

68
00:04:31,569 --> 00:04:32,900
Maybe...

69
00:04:35,105 --> 00:04:36,663
forever.

70
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,799
Well, that's
kind of depressing.

71
00:04:38,876 --> 00:04:40,309
Yes, it is.

72
00:04:40,377 --> 00:04:43,210
But I have
something for you.

73
00:05:06,971 --> 00:05:08,404
Let me see.

74
00:05:08,472 --> 00:05:09,404
Number 17,

75
00:05:09,473 --> 00:05:11,407
number 13.

76
00:05:11,475 --> 00:05:13,670
Where the hell is it?

77
00:05:13,744 --> 00:05:15,439
Ahh.

78
00:05:15,512 --> 00:05:17,377
Number eight.

79
00:05:18,749 --> 00:05:20,546
This is
what you need.

80
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:24,953
Dilute this with water
1,000 to 1.

81
00:05:25,055 --> 00:05:27,489
You don't want it
to be too strong.

82
00:05:27,558 --> 00:05:30,493
You take a sip,
and you swallow.

83
00:05:30,561 --> 00:05:31,994
And when you speak,

84
00:05:32,062 --> 00:05:34,929
women will find you
fascinating.

85
00:05:34,999 --> 00:05:37,399
I'm a biochemist.

86
00:06:03,293 --> 00:06:04,726
You take this.

87
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:07,758
You'll be back.

88
00:06:09,299 --> 00:06:11,733
So, tell me,
there was this woman

89
00:06:11,802 --> 00:06:14,236
I saw you having lunch
with the other day.

90
00:06:14,304 --> 00:06:15,293
Huh?

91
00:06:15,372 --> 00:06:17,772
She's just...
just somebody I work with.

92
00:06:17,841 --> 00:06:18,808
Uh-huh.

93
00:06:18,876 --> 00:06:20,673
Were there any
romantic possibilities?

94
00:06:22,713 --> 00:06:23,645
No.

95
00:06:23,714 --> 00:06:24,612
No?

96
00:06:25,849 --> 00:06:27,009
Why not?

97
00:06:28,218 --> 00:06:29,651
No, you see, I'm...

98
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,620
She's, um,
she's not my type.

99
00:06:31,722 --> 00:06:33,155
Oh, she's not
your type.

100
00:06:33,223 --> 00:06:34,656
That was a lie.

101
00:06:34,725 --> 00:06:37,159
Except for the fact
that she had

102
00:06:37,227 --> 00:06:38,660
kind of a boyfriend,

103
00:06:38,729 --> 00:06:40,196
Diane was exactly my type.

104
00:06:40,297 --> 00:06:43,232
I'm a comparative
psychobiologist.

105
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,097
I put, uh, primates...

106
00:06:45,169 --> 00:06:46,602
chimpanzees...
through tests.

107
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:49,104
I note the behavior
of the subject,

108
00:06:49,173 --> 00:06:51,733
and I hope the results
are analogous to humans.

109
00:06:51,809 --> 00:06:54,437
Do you put electrical things
in their brains?

110
00:06:54,511 --> 00:06:55,637
No.

111
00:06:55,713 --> 00:06:56,645
No.

112
00:06:56,714 --> 00:06:58,614
But that's done,
isn't it?

113
00:06:58,682 --> 00:06:59,614
Yes.

114
00:07:00,684 --> 00:07:01,810
Why?

115
00:07:01,885 --> 00:07:03,318
You can measure
electrical activity,

116
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:05,854
or, with a minute
amount of current,

117
00:07:05,923 --> 00:07:08,289
you can stimulate a feeling
or... or a thought.

118
00:07:08,358 --> 00:07:09,985
You can stimulate
a feeling?

119
00:07:10,094 --> 00:07:11,026
Yes.

120
00:07:11,095 --> 00:07:12,027
For example,

121
00:07:12,096 --> 00:07:13,529
there was
this experiment

122
00:07:13,597 --> 00:07:15,531
where an electrode
was planted

123
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,534
in the pleasure center
of a monkey's brain.

124
00:07:18,602 --> 00:07:21,036
When the monkey
hit a button,

125
00:07:21,105 --> 00:07:24,040
it sent a signal
to the electrode,

126
00:07:24,108 --> 00:07:27,009
in effect exciting
the monkey sexually.

127
00:07:27,077 --> 00:07:28,009
You're kidding.

128
00:07:28,078 --> 00:07:29,136
No.

129
00:07:29,213 --> 00:07:31,147
Can you guess
what happened?

130
00:07:31,215 --> 00:07:32,773
Was it a male monkey?

131
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:34,112
Yes.

132
00:07:34,184 --> 00:07:36,652
He slammed the button
till he died.

133
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,984
Oh, so, you know
this experiment.

134
00:07:39,089 --> 00:07:40,886
I know men, honey.

135
00:07:42,059 --> 00:07:42,991
Oh, stop.

136
00:07:45,763 --> 00:07:49,199
I think she is definitely
Paul's type.

137
00:07:49,266 --> 00:07:50,699
She's got that,
uh...

138
00:07:50,768 --> 00:07:52,497
je ne sais quoi,

139
00:07:52,569 --> 00:07:53,501
that, uh...

140
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:55,003
Very sexy girl.

141
00:07:55,072 --> 00:07:57,506
You should go
talk to her.

142
00:07:57,574 --> 00:07:58,506
Really.

143
00:07:58,575 --> 00:08:00,008
You should do it.

144
00:08:02,713 --> 00:08:03,645
Do it.

145
00:08:03,714 --> 00:08:05,113
I don't know her.

146
00:08:05,182 --> 00:08:06,615
Well,
that is the point.

147
00:08:06,683 --> 00:08:08,116
You go talk to her,

148
00:08:08,185 --> 00:08:09,618
then you'll
know her.

149
00:08:09,686 --> 00:08:12,120
Well, maybe she doesn't
want to talk to anybody.

150
00:08:12,222 --> 00:08:13,154
Maybe.

151
00:08:13,223 --> 00:08:14,656
Maybe she does, huh?

152
00:08:14,725 --> 00:08:16,659
You got to
keep taking chances,

153
00:08:16,727 --> 00:08:18,160
keep rolling
the dice

154
00:08:18,228 --> 00:08:21,095
till you find someone
who does want to talk.

155
00:08:21,165 --> 00:08:22,359
Expert advice.

156
00:08:22,432 --> 00:08:23,364
Go.

157
00:08:23,433 --> 00:08:24,991
Go.

158
00:08:25,068 --> 00:08:26,831
I'll tell you what.

159
00:08:26,904 --> 00:08:30,340
I'll pay you $20
to go talk to her.

160
00:08:32,276 --> 00:08:34,676
$20.Just go
talk to her.

161
00:08:34,745 --> 00:08:35,837
No.

162
00:08:37,714 --> 00:08:38,942
$40.

163
00:08:40,017 --> 00:08:42,417
I don't want to do it.

164
00:08:42,486 --> 00:08:43,578
$60.

165
00:08:45,289 --> 00:08:46,756
$80.

166
00:08:48,592 --> 00:08:49,957

After weeks of testing,

427

we discovered
how it works.

428
00:25:08,004 --> 00:25:10,973
When swallowed, it affects
the vocal cords directly,

429
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,200
so when you speak,

430
00:25:12,275 --> 00:25:15,108
microtremors encoded
within your voice

431
00:25:15,178 --> 00:25:16,941
stimulate
tiny little hairs

432
00:25:17,013 --> 00:25:19,675
in the inner ear
of the opposite sex.

433
00:25:19,749 --> 00:25:21,910
The vibration sends
a signal to the brain,

434
00:25:22,018 --> 00:25:24,509
which, in turn,
produces a combination

435
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,349
of mood-altering
endogenous chemicals

436
00:25:26,455 --> 00:25:29,390

of feeling in love.

438
00:25:30,526 --> 00:25:31,925
We also discovered
that, one...

439
00:25:31,994 --> 00:25:34,690
It made members
of the same sex hostile.

440

Two...

441
00:25:35,765 --> 00:25:37,790

442

for four hours at a time.

The next logical step
was to test it on humans,

446
00:25:46,909 --> 00:25:47,967
but who?

447
00:25:49,946 --> 00:25:52,039

moral obligation to mankind

448

potentially dangerous drug

didn't fall into
the wrong hands,

450

test subjects we could trust?

scientifically unorthodox,

but...

453
00:26:06,495 --> 00:26:08,429
perhaps we could
both take samples

454
00:26:08,497 --> 00:26:11,091
and test it ourselves in
a real-world environment.

00:44:09,311 --> 00:44:11,176
you like those radials?

672
00:44:28,463 --> 00:44:30,397
They say that
power corrupts,

673
00:44:30,465 --> 00:44:33,730
and absolute power
corrupts absolutely.

674
00:44:33,802 --> 00:44:35,895
Well...

675
00:44:35,971 --> 00:44:37,063
they're right.

676
00:44:38,306 --> 00:44:40,570
They also say that
the path of excess

677
00:44:40,675 --> 00:44:42,836
leads to
the palace of wisdom.

678
00:44:42,944 --> 00:44:45,242
My palace of wisdom

679
00:44:45,313 --> 00:44:49,079
was the Sigma Delta Pi
Sorority House.

680
00:44:49,150 --> 00:44:51,641
[Beethoven's
Fifth Symphony Plays]

681
00:45:11,639 --> 00:45:13,573
I learned a lot
that night.

682
00:45:13,641 --> 00:45:15,370
I learned a lot
about myself.

683
00:45:15,477 --> 00:45:16,910
I learned a lot
about women.

684
00:45:16,978 --> 00:45:19,708
I also learned about
an obscure panty raid law

685
00:45:19,781 --> 00:45:22,682
which prohibits men
to be in a sorority house

686
00:45:22,751 --> 00:45:24,412
after 9 p.m.

687
00:46:13,768 --> 00:46:15,759
How's it going?

688
00:46:15,870 --> 00:46:16,996
Can I help you?

689
00:46:17,105 --> 00:46:19,573
No. I'm here
to see a friend.

690
00:46:19,674 --> 00:46:20,834
And who is that?

691
00:46:20,909 --> 00:46:22,171
Diane Farrow.

692
00:46:22,243 --> 00:46:23,676
I'm sorry,
but Miss Farrow

693
00:46:23,745 --> 00:46:24,871
isn't expecting
company.

694
00:46:24,946 --> 00:46:27,210
Oh, I'm just
dropping by.

695
00:46:27,282 --> 00:46:28,840
I'm sorry.

696
00:46:30,218 --> 00:46:32,652
Listen, why don't
you go tell her

697
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:35,814
that Gary Logan
is here?

698
00:46:35,890 --> 00:46:36,948
All right.

699
00:46:37,025 --> 00:46:39,789
Stan, there's a
Gary Logan out here

700
00:46:39,861 --> 00:46:41,294
to see
Miss Farrow.

701
00:46:46,935 --> 00:46:48,402
I'm sorry.

702
00:46:48,503 --> 00:46:50,596
You're kidding.

703
00:46:50,705 --> 00:46:52,730
No.
She has company.

704
00:46:54,109 --> 00:46:55,041
Oh.

705
00:46:57,745 --> 00:46:59,440
Who is that guy?

706
00:46:59,514 --> 00:47:01,573
Prince Geoffrey.

707
00:47:01,649 --> 00:47:03,776
Prince?

708
00:47:03,852 --> 00:47:05,911
Prince of what?

709
00:47:05,987 --> 00:47:07,511
England.

710
00:47:14,929 --> 00:47:16,362
Unbelievable.

711
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:20,959
Ahem.

712
00:47:21,069 --> 00:47:22,627
Is, uh...

713
00:47:22,737 --> 00:47:24,170
Thank you.

714
00:47:24,239 --> 00:47:25,672
Right through here?

715
00:47:28,109 --> 00:47:29,041
Diane?

716
00:47:35,884 --> 00:47:37,317
Wow!

717

you... you look great!

What did you do?

720
00:47:47,562 --> 00:47:49,655
You got a haircut?

721
00:47:49,731 --> 00:47:53,633
Well, that is
a great haircut.

722
00:47:53,735 --> 00:47:55,032
You got your teeth fixed.

723
00:47:55,136 --> 00:47:57,536
Oh, you're on the potion!

724
00:47:57,605 --> 00:47:58,663
You're on the po...

725
00:48:03,044 --> 00:48:04,773
So, uh...

726
00:48:04,846 --> 00:48:06,780
nice... nice clothes.

727
00:48:06,848 --> 00:48:08,816
Did you buy those?

728
00:48:10,084 --> 00:48:11,016
Really?

729
00:48:11,085 --> 00:48:13,451
Ah. Having fun, huh?

730
00:48:15,690 --> 00:48:17,453
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

731
00:48:17,525 --> 00:48:19,288
Yeah.

732
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:21,021
"What were you doing

733
00:48:21,095 --> 00:48:22,960
in the sorority?"

734
00:48:23,031 --> 00:48:24,123
Uh...

735
00:48:24,199 --> 00:48:26,724
what was I doing
in the sorority?

736
00:48:26,834 --> 00:48:29,701
Ha ha ha ha ha...

737
00:48:31,239 --> 00:48:32,672
Oh, no.

738
00:48:35,243 --> 00:48:37,507
I... I was, um...

739
00:48:37,579 --> 00:48:39,137
I was, uh...

740
00:48:41,216 --> 00:48:43,150
I can't tell you.
I'm sorry. I can't.

741
00:48:43,218 --> 00:48:44,981
I was doing research.

742
00:48:45,053 --> 00:48:46,418
I... I was.

743
00:48:46,487 --> 00:48:47,715
What?

744
00:48:47,789 --> 00:48:48,721
What?

745
00:48:51,893 --> 00:48:52,825
What?

746
00:48:54,395 --> 00:48:55,828
Oh, you're kidding.

747
00:48:55,897 --> 00:48:58,661
Heh. Uh... heh heh.

748
00:48:58,733 --> 00:49:00,166
Uh... ahem.

749
00:49:00,268 --> 00:49:02,259
All right,
all right, all right.

750
00:49:02,370 --> 00:49:04,804
Can you keep a secret?

751
00:49:04,872 --> 00:49:06,339
So can I.

752
00:49:08,042 --> 00:49:09,805
I'm sorry.
I... I just...

753
00:49:11,346 --> 00:49:13,280
Oh, look,
that is not fair,

754
00:49:13,348 --> 00:49:14,781
because you're
on the potion.

755
00:49:14,849 --> 00:49:16,009
You can't talk.

756

How do I know you
haven't been doing

757
00:49:18,086 --> 00:49:19,519
some unspeakably
sordid things?

758
00:49:19,587 --> 00:49:20,519
What?

759
00:49:26,027 --> 00:49:26,959
You're kidding.

760
00:49:31,833 --> 00:49:32,959
What are you,

761
00:49:33,067 --> 00:49:35,797

Who's in there?

763
00:49:46,481 --> 00:49:49,450
You look familiar.

764

Uh, I'm the prince
of England.

765

Paul, we're going to
a charity arts auction tonight.

Would you
like to come?

769
00:50:05,433 --> 00:50:07,094
You're not speaking.

770
00:50:09,337 --> 00:50:10,770
Why aren't you
speaking?

771
00:50:11,939 --> 00:50:13,930
You notice Diane
isn't speaking?

772
00:50:15,843 --> 00:50:19,836
Oh! You're playing the mute game
again, aren't you?

Yes, you are!

the mute game again.

[British Accent]
Really?

776
00:50:28,923 --> 00:50:31,187
So, you are coming
to the party.

777
00:50:31,259 --> 00:50:33,352
Tell him to come
to the party.

778

"you must come."

780

Oh, uh...
you have a tux?

781

how wonderful to see you.

the arts council.

Miss Childs,
so nice to see you.

784
00:50:57,618 --> 00:51:00,052
These are my friends
Paul and Diane.

785
00:51:00,121 --> 00:51:01,486
How do you do?

786
00:51:01,556 --> 00:51:04,582
This is one of our
new South American sculptors.

787
00:51:04,659 --> 00:51:07,594
He's going to be
having a one-man show here.

Thanks.

789

Uh, shall we go?

790
00:51:32,186 --> 00:51:33,175
Coming, Paul?

791
00:51:34,589 --> 00:51:37,217
No? All right, then.

792
00:51:46,501 --> 00:51:48,935
Have you met
our mayor Mr. Cox?

...plaster cast mold,

795

and then it was done
in the lost wax method,

796
00:52:30,578 --> 00:52:34,105
which is why it's so
anatomically correct.

797
00:52:34,182 --> 00:52:35,615
Excuse me, Your Highness.

798

He's awfully good
with the ladies.

799

A 2. Oh, deuces are wild.
I got the 2.

800

Uh, the 3 is yours.

801

Uh... the king is for me.

802

4 and, um...

804
00:52:57,972 --> 00:53:00,907
I'm sorry.
We can't do this.

805
00:53:08,549 --> 00:53:10,483
Could I talk to you?

806
00:53:21,062 --> 00:53:23,997
Uh, would you excuse me
for a minute?

807

What?

Geoffrey proposed
to me last night.

824
00:54:32,033 --> 00:54:34,866
W-W-W-What'd
you tell him?

825
00:54:34,969 --> 00:54:38,200
I told him I would
think about it.

826
00:54:38,272 --> 00:54:39,705
Think about it.

827

W-Why'd you
tell him that?

all my life,

831
00:54:58,092 --> 00:54:59,559
I've felt...

832
00:55:00,661 --> 00:55:01,787
ugly.

833
00:55:03,531 --> 00:55:07,490
And now I have
the world's most desirable man

834
00:55:07,568 --> 00:55:10,002
telling me that
I am beautiful.

I have the prince of England
at home pining for me.

You're disturbed.

839
00:55:27,455 --> 00:55:28,888
W-What causes this?

840
00:55:28,956 --> 00:55:32,483
Well, I haven't had
a date in four years.

841

What?

842
00:55:43,371 --> 00:55:46,397
Uh, well, your... your...
the joke about the date.

843
00:55:46,507 --> 00:55:48,134
Well, what about it?

844
00:55:48,242 --> 00:55:52,838
Well, Diane...
we had a date.

845
00:55:52,913 --> 00:55:54,938
We had a date?

846
00:55:55,016 --> 00:55:57,075
Yeah. Remember?

847
00:55:57,151 --> 00:55:59,176
No, I don't.

848
00:55:59,253 --> 00:56:01,517
The lunch...
we went out to lunch.

849
00:56:01,589 --> 00:56:03,079
That was a date?

850
00:56:03,157 --> 00:56:05,182
Yeah.

851
00:56:05,259 --> 00:56:09,195
I thought a date was when
you went to somebody's house

852
00:56:09,263 --> 00:56:11,197
and you picked them up

853
00:56:11,265 --> 00:56:13,358
and you took them out
to dinner.

854
00:56:13,434 --> 00:56:15,868
Well, that is
a conventional date,

855
00:56:15,936 --> 00:56:18,996
but you... you don't
have to do that.

856
00:56:19,106 --> 00:56:20,539
Gosh, I'm sorry.

857
00:56:20,608 --> 00:56:22,906
I had no idea that
that was a date.

858
00:56:22,977 --> 00:56:26,504
Was there a second date
that I'm not aware of?

859
00:56:26,580 --> 00:56:30,380
No. Because you said you
had kind of a boyfriend.

860
00:56:30,451 --> 00:56:31,850
Oh.

861
00:56:33,287 --> 00:56:35,585
Well, he's not a boyfriend.

862
00:56:36,891 --> 00:56:38,153
No?

863
00:56:38,225 --> 00:56:39,283
No.

864
00:56:50,271 --> 00:56:51,704
Are you hungry?

865
00:56:52,773 --> 00:56:54,900
Yeah.

866
00:56:55,009 --> 00:56:59,412
Do you want to go out
and get something to eat?

867
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:02,176
You know, I'll drive
to your house,

868
00:57:02,249 --> 00:57:03,682
and I'll pick you up
and...

869
00:57:03,751 --> 00:57:05,412
talk to your father.

870
00:57:06,754 --> 00:57:08,688
So this is a date?

871
00:57:08,756 --> 00:57:10,189
This is
definitely a date.

872
00:57:11,258 --> 00:57:12,350
O.K.

873
00:57:55,302 --> 00:57:57,668
And then something
magical happened.

874
00:57:57,772 --> 00:58:00,206
For the first time
in my life,

875
00:58:00,274 --> 00:58:01,707
I felt something perfect.

876
00:58:01,776 --> 00:58:05,177
Once you feel that feeling,
that perfect feeling,

877
00:58:05,246 --> 00:58:07,680
you want it to last
forever,

878
00:58:07,748 --> 00:58:10,683
but since love
comes with no guarantee,

879
00:58:10,751 --> 00:58:13,185
you do what you can do,

880
00:58:13,254 --> 00:58:13,948
and the only thing
you can do

881
00:58:14,021 --> 00:58:15,454
is get married.

882
00:58:15,523 --> 00:58:18,151
So you plan
your moment carefully,

883
00:58:18,225 --> 00:58:21,683
making it as enticing
and romantic as possible.

884
00:58:21,762 --> 00:58:24,424
And if they accept,
you marry

885
00:58:24,498 --> 00:58:27,194
and cross your fingers
and hope it lasts.

886
00:58:27,268 --> 00:58:31,728
I couldn't wait to spend
the rest of my life with Diane.

887
00:58:31,806 --> 00:58:34,240
I booked this great old
bed and breakfast

I think I should tell you.

01:01:26,146 --> 01:01:29,946
I've been

off and on for about,
um, 10 years,

were problems.

I love you.

1004
01:04:53,187 --> 01:04:55,155
All right.

1005
01:04:55,222 --> 01:04:56,655
I love you.

1006
01:04:56,723 --> 01:04:59,021
O.K. Bye.

1007
01:05:03,030 --> 01:05:06,090
Gary doesn't want me
talking to you anymore.

1008
01:05:08,168 --> 01:05:10,261
Diane,
what do you want?

1009
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:15,674
I don't want
to lose him.

1010
01:05:15,742 --> 01:05:17,175
I love him.

1011
01:05:18,712 --> 01:05:21,112
Sorry.

1012
01:05:21,181 --> 01:05:24,617
This plan was clearly
not going to work.

1013
01:05:24,685 --> 01:05:27,153
Gary's influence
over Diane was too powerful.

1014
01:05:27,221 --> 01:05:29,655
She'd do anything
to make him happy.

1015
01:05:29,723 --> 01:05:33,420
It was like she'd joined
some kind of cult.

1016
01:05:35,596 --> 01:05:40,033
I went from feeling I'd be
in love with Diane forever

1017
01:05:40,100 --> 01:05:44,560
to wondering if I'd ever fall
in love with anyone again.

1018
01:05:44,638 --> 01:05:45,900
I would.

1019
01:05:54,114 --> 01:05:55,445
[Honk Honk]

1020
01:05:55,515 --> 01:05:56,447
[Coughs]

1021
01:05:56,516 --> 01:05:57,448
[Honk]

1022
01:05:57,517 --> 01:05:58,848
[Coughs]

1023
01:05:58,919 --> 01:06:00,113
[Honk Honk]

1024
01:06:03,123 --> 01:06:04,681
[Knock Knock]

1025
01:06:07,761 --> 01:06:09,023
Oh, hi.

1026
01:06:10,264 --> 01:06:13,131
Hi. I was
in the area.

1027
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:16,135
I thought I'd stop
by and say hello.

1028
01:06:16,203 --> 01:06:19,195
Oh, that was
very nice of you.

1029
01:06:19,306 --> 01:06:22,139
Uh... do you
want to come in?

1030
01:06:23,210 --> 01:06:24,142
O.K.

1031
01:06:36,290 --> 01:06:38,656
Can I use
your bathroom?

1032
01:07:29,142 --> 01:07:33,442
So, uh...
what is it you do again?

1033
01:07:33,513 --> 01:07:35,105
Accountant or something?

1034
01:07:46,226 --> 01:07:47,659
There we go.

1035
01:07:47,728 --> 01:07:49,161
So is that
everything?

1036
01:07:49,229 --> 01:07:51,163
Yeah, this is
the whole thing.

1037
01:07:51,231 --> 01:07:52,664
Cables?

1038
01:07:52,733 --> 01:07:55,167
The cables are in with
the instruction books.

1039
01:07:55,235 --> 01:07:56,668
Good job, buddy.

1040
01:07:56,737 --> 01:07:58,705
You're coming right
back, right?

1041
01:07:58,772 --> 01:07:59,704
You bet.

1042
01:07:59,773 --> 01:08:01,741
O.K. Bye-bye.

1043
01:08:03,777 --> 01:08:06,575
I gave her anything I had
of value,

1044
01:08:06,646 --> 01:08:08,580
including all
the love potion.

1045
01:08:08,648 --> 01:08:11,173
I tried explaining how it
affects the pharyngeals,

1046
01:08:11,251 --> 01:08:14,220
but this was clearly
a woman more interested

1047
01:08:14,287 --> 01:08:16,687
in fiduciary gain
than in science.

1048
01:08:16,757 --> 01:08:18,816
Great girl.

1049
01:08:18,892 --> 01:08:22,692
For four hours, I could
think of nothing but Marisa...

1050
01:08:22,763 --> 01:08:27,063
Beautiful, intelligent,
all-around wonderful gal Marisa.

1051
01:08:27,134 --> 01:08:29,068
Then four hours later...

1052
01:08:30,237 --> 01:08:31,636
I could've strangled her.

1053
01:08:31,738 --> 01:08:34,206
I couldn't believe
how powerful an influence

1054
01:08:34,307 --> 01:08:35,740
the potion had over me.

1055
01:08:35,809 --> 01:08:38,642
I would've done anything
to make Marisa happy.

1056
01:08:38,712 --> 01:08:42,648
It was like I had joined
some kind of cult.

1057
01:08:44,451 --> 01:08:47,648
You sold all of it,
the whole bottle?

1058
01:08:47,721 --> 01:08:49,120
Yes.

1059
01:08:49,189 --> 01:08:51,783
The person who bought this,
what did they look like?

1060
01:08:51,858 --> 01:08:55,726
Tall, very handsome,
dark eyes, dark hair.

1061
01:08:55,796 --> 01:08:58,060
Did he wear a ring?

1062
01:08:58,131 --> 01:09:00,156
Yes.

1063
01:09:00,233 --> 01:09:03,430
A gold snake with
rubies for eyes.

1064
01:09:10,277 --> 01:09:11,209
Hello?

1065
01:09:11,311 --> 01:09:13,677
Diane, I just got back
from Madame Ruth's.

1066
01:09:13,747 --> 01:09:16,181
Gary is using
the potion on you.

1067
01:09:16,249 --> 01:09:17,739
I'm in love with him.

1068
01:09:17,818 --> 01:09:20,184
No, you're not.
Go away for four hours

1069
01:09:20,253 --> 01:09:23,188
and see if you're still
in love with him.

1070
01:09:23,256 --> 01:09:24,689
Paul, this is
ridiculous.

1071
01:09:24,758 --> 01:09:27,693
Why does he make you take
the telephone everywhere?

1072
01:09:27,761 --> 01:09:30,195
Does he call you
every four hours?

1073
01:09:30,263 --> 01:09:33,198
He thinks you're using
the love potion on me.

1074
01:09:33,266 --> 01:09:35,200
Don't tell him!
He's the enemy!

1075
01:09:35,268 --> 01:09:37,133
[Gary] Just hang up
the phone, Diane.

1076
01:09:37,237 --> 01:09:39,671
He must have
found out about it.

1077
01:09:39,739 --> 01:09:41,172
Did you write it down?

1078
01:09:41,241 --> 01:09:42,674
I have to go.

1079
01:09:42,742 --> 01:09:44,175
[Gary]
Hang up the phone.

1080
01:09:44,244 --> 01:09:47,145
He must have read
your journal and...

1081
01:09:47,214 --> 01:09:48,146
[Click]

1082
01:09:53,587 --> 01:09:54,519
Diane.

1083
01:09:54,588 --> 01:09:56,522
I'm not listening
to you.

1084
01:09:56,590 --> 01:09:59,525
I am not using it.
He is.

1085
01:09:59,593 --> 01:10:01,026
It'll wear off someday,

1086
01:10:01,094 --> 01:10:04,154
and you'll be pregnant,
and you'll be married,

1087
01:10:04,231 --> 01:10:06,165
and you'll have
that asshole's children.

1088
01:10:06,233 --> 01:10:09,669
It'll wear off.
You'll be married to a man you hate

1089
01:10:09,736 --> 01:10:11,838
with a bunch of little
assholes running around!

1090
01:10:11,972 --> 01:10:13,269
I kept calling her,

1091
01:10:13,340 --> 01:10:15,934
but she wouldn't
take my calls.

1092
01:10:16,042 --> 01:10:17,441
I wrote her letters,

1093
01:10:17,544 --> 01:10:18,943
but they came back
unanswered.

1094
01:10:19,012 --> 01:10:20,138
I tried confronting Gary.

1095
01:10:21,414 --> 01:10:23,644
That didn't work.

1096
01:10:23,717 --> 01:10:25,912
There was only one stone
left unturned.

1097
01:10:25,986 --> 01:10:27,920
Do you have an antidote

1098
01:10:27,988 --> 01:10:30,320
or something
more powerful or...

1099
01:10:32,359 --> 01:10:33,417
Sit down.

1100
01:11:21,841 --> 01:11:24,537
Years ago
there was a plague.

1101
01:11:26,146 --> 01:11:28,171
It affected many people.

1102
01:11:28,281 --> 01:11:32,217
It did not in any way
make them feel ill.

1103
01:11:32,285 --> 01:11:35,311
They lived long lives,
but...

1104
01:11:40,226 --> 01:11:42,694
something inside of them
died...

1105
01:11:42,762 --> 01:11:45,253
The capacity
to love forever.

1106
01:11:46,833 --> 01:11:49,267
This is the cure.

1107
01:11:55,508 --> 01:12:00,241
Love Potion Number Nine
does not create emotion.

1108
01:12:00,347 --> 01:12:02,577
It purifies it.

1109
01:12:02,649 --> 01:12:04,344
Love is often obscured

1110
01:12:04,417 --> 01:12:09,081
by doubt,
prejudice, suspicion.

1111
01:12:10,857 --> 01:12:13,018
With number nine,

1112
01:12:13,093 --> 01:12:16,529
all that is eliminated.

1113
01:12:16,596 --> 01:12:18,587
It becomes pure.

1114
01:12:19,866 --> 01:12:22,460
The greatest tragedy
in life

1115
01:12:22,535 --> 01:12:24,469
is when love fades.

1116
01:12:25,872 --> 01:12:28,807
With Love Potion
Number Nine,

1117
01:12:28,875 --> 01:12:30,308
it never fades.

1118
01:12:31,845 --> 01:12:34,939
So if you ever
loved each other

1119
01:12:35,048 --> 01:12:37,414
and you both
take this potion,

1120
01:12:37,484 --> 01:12:39,918
you will love each other
again,

1121
01:12:39,986 --> 01:12:42,921
as much as you ever
loved each other...

1122
01:12:42,989 --> 01:12:44,388
forever.

1123
01:12:48,795 --> 01:12:51,923
Are you absolutely sure
she was in love with you?

1124
01:12:51,998 --> 01:12:53,260
Uh...

1125
01:12:55,435 --> 01:12:56,367
mm-hmm.

1126
01:12:57,737 --> 01:12:58,669
Why?

1127
01:12:58,738 --> 01:13:00,763
If you both
take this potion

1128
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:03,274
and you were
in love with her

1129
01:13:03,376 --> 01:13:06,277
but she really never
was in love with you,

1130
01:13:06,346 --> 01:13:09,782
you will love her for
the rest of your life,

1131
01:13:09,849 --> 01:13:13,250
and she will hate you
for the rest of hers.

1132
01:13:19,859 --> 01:13:21,087
Great.

1133
01:13:32,005 --> 01:13:33,939
How does it work?

1134
01:13:35,108 --> 01:13:38,202
She said drink from
the same cup, then kiss.

1135
01:13:38,311 --> 01:13:40,745
Five minutes later,
it will take effect.

1136
01:13:40,814 --> 01:13:43,749
If your heart is willing and can
be pleased, wait and listen,

1137
01:13:43,817 --> 01:13:46,547
and you'll hear a song
from the breeze.

1138
01:13:46,619 --> 01:13:49,247
So if you're willing
to fall in love,

1139
01:13:49,322 --> 01:13:51,756
and five minutes
after the big smooch,

1140
01:13:51,825 --> 01:13:53,759
you'll hear
this wind musical thing,

1141
01:13:53,827 --> 01:13:56,387
and whoosh,
you're in love forever.

1142
01:13:56,463 --> 01:14:00,194
If your heart is stubborn
like the heart of a fool,

1143
01:14:00,266 --> 01:14:02,894
you will taste
the sweat of a mule.

1144
01:14:02,969 --> 01:14:06,268
So if you're an asshole
and not willing to commit,

1145
01:14:06,339 --> 01:14:08,273
then five minutes
after the kiss,

1146
01:14:08,341 --> 01:14:09,774
you'll taste mule sweat,

1147
01:14:09,843 --> 01:14:11,174
which, I imagine,
is terrible.

1148
01:14:11,277 --> 01:14:13,745
So if I take this potion
with Diane,

1149
01:14:13,847 --> 01:14:15,781
I kiss her,
five minutes later...

1150
01:14:15,849 --> 01:14:18,283
assuming that she's
still in love with me...

1151
01:14:18,351 --> 01:14:20,285
number nine
will override number eight,

1152
01:14:20,353 --> 01:14:22,787
no matter how much
Gary takes number eight.

1153
01:14:22,856 --> 01:14:25,347
That's assuming
she's in love with me.

1154
01:14:25,425 --> 01:14:27,052
Paul...

1155
01:14:27,127 --> 01:14:30,290
And this is the reason
why you guys are here...

1156
01:14:30,363 --> 01:14:31,796
Diane's not talking to me,

1157
01:14:31,865 --> 01:14:34,299
so she's not going to
willingly take the potion.

1158
01:14:34,367 --> 01:14:35,800
I'm going
to need your help.

1159
01:14:35,869 --> 01:14:37,734
The plan is very simple.

1160
01:14:37,804 --> 01:14:40,739
We go to her house,
I knock on the door...

1161
01:14:40,807 --> 01:14:42,741
You guys wait

If she answers, I burst in.
You guys follow.

1163
01:14:45,812 --> 01:14:48,246
If she doesn't,
we knock down the door,

1164
01:14:48,314 --> 01:14:50,805
grab her, hold her down,
I tickle her knee,

1165
01:14:50,917 --> 01:14:53,078
and her mouth will open.

1166
01:14:53,153 --> 01:14:56,748
I force the potion in,
get her to swallow it.

1167
01:14:56,823 --> 01:14:59,758
I kiss her. Then we wait
for five minutes.

1168
01:14:59,826 --> 01:15:01,760
Of course, getting her
to swallow

1169
01:15:01,828 --> 01:15:04,763
is going to be
the toughest part

1170
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:07,459
'cause, hey, you know,
women don't want to swallow.

1171
01:15:07,534 --> 01:15:09,525
Sorry. Uh...

01:15:09,602 --> 01:15:12,036
Oh, also, if Gary is there,

1173
01:15:12,105 --> 01:15:14,039
it's going to get physical,

1174
01:15:14,107 --> 01:15:15,039
'cause, uh...

1175
01:15:15,108 --> 01:15:17,269
But there are four of us,

1176
01:15:17,377 --> 01:15:20,278
and I think we can
take him...

1177
01:15:20,346 --> 01:15:22,280
unless he has a gun,

1178

but chances
are pretty remote.

You guys have any questions?

1180

What? What?
What's with that look?

You don't believe me?

It's not a matter
of not believing you.

It's just...

I think it is a matter
of not believing you.

but you're asking us

Ron, do you
believe me?

1189

Hello.

1221
01:17:37,850 --> 01:17:39,340
Are you Diane's
friend?

1222
01:17:39,452 --> 01:17:41,386
- Yeah. Who are you?
- Paul.

1223
01:17:41,454 --> 01:17:42,785
You're the Paul
she works with?

1224
01:17:42,855 --> 01:17:43,787
Yeah.

1225
01:17:43,856 --> 01:17:46,757
The one she
hit it off with?

1226
01:17:46,826 --> 01:17:48,691
She told me
not to talk to you.

1227
01:17:48,761 --> 01:17:51,696
There's something strange
going on here, isn't there?

1228
01:17:51,764 --> 01:17:53,197
Yes, there is.

1229
01:17:53,266 --> 01:17:55,791
Suddenly she's dating
the prince of England,

1230
01:17:55,868 --> 01:17:57,802
then she's crazy
about you,

1231
01:17:57,870 --> 01:17:59,929
now she's marrying
the schmuck.

1232
01:18:00,006 --> 01:18:01,439
Marrying?
She's marrying him?

1233
01:18:01,507 --> 01:18:02,633
- Yes.
- When?

Oh, Jesus.

She forgot this
in all the excitement.

Uh, hi.

Would you like me
to tell you?

You get her to drink
from the glass,

1241
01:18:18,291 --> 01:18:20,816
then bring the glass
back to me.

1242
01:18:20,893 --> 01:18:23,953
I'll sip from it,
come in, and kiss her.

is he big?

Yeah.

1245
01:18:38,344 --> 01:18:41,279
Now, you said that she
was crazy about me.

1246
01:18:41,347 --> 01:18:44,282
Is that the word
she used, crazy?

01:18:44,350 --> 01:18:45,783
Yes.

1248
01:18:45,852 --> 01:18:50,289
Did she ever say that
she was in love with me?

that word?

Drink from
the same glass, then kiss her?

thick.
