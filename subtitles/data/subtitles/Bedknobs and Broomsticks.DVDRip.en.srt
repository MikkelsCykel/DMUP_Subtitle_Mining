00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,830
You there, which way
to Pepperinge Eye?

2
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,674
Couldn't say, sir. lt said on the
wireless to paint out the signposts

3
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,320
in case the Nazis drop in.

4
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,675
l'm not a Nazi!
l'm a British officer!

5
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:16,594
That's what you'd say
if you was a Nazi, isn't it, sir?

6
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,750
Drive on, corporal.

7
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,359
Sorry to give you so many
but you do have six bedrooms.

8
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,193
No trouble.
Anything to get the poor things away

9
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,158
from those terrible
bombings in London.

10
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,640
What about us?

11
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,518
- Oh, yes. What is your name?
- Rawlins, ma'am.

12
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,114
Oh, yes. Here we are. Carrie.

13
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,792
Charles.

14
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,757
Paul.

15
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,400
You're for Miss Price.
l'm expecting her in.

16
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,472
- <i>Call out the navy</i>
- l won't be a moment.

17
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,278
Please don't touch anything.

18
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,669
<i>Call out the tanks</i>

19
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:17,753
<i>From the Cliffs of Dover,</i>
<i>call up the gulls</i>

20
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,118
<i>And don't forget</i>
<i>the loyal territorials</i>

21
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:26,159
<i>But who's digging in here?</i>
<i>Who will defend</i>

22
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,279
<i>Every inch of England,</i>
<i>no matter what they send?</i>

23
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,353
<i>Who's standing firm</i>
<i>in our own front yard?</i>

24
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,558
<i>The soldiers of the Old Home Guard,</i>
<i>that's who</i>

25
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:42,633
<i>The soldiers of the Old Home Guard</i>

26
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,032
<i>We wrote the story</i>
<i>of the old brigades</i>

27

28
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,193
<i>Who's standing firm</i>
<i>in our own front yard?</i>

29
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,193
<i>The soldiers of the Old Home Guard,</i>

30
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,035
<i>The soldiers of the Old Home Guard</i>

31
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,597
- Halt!
- Carry on, sergeant.

32
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,592
Captain Greer, sir,
from headquarters at Tidbury,

33
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,716
here to check military preparations.

34
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,553
Tell them Pepperinge Eye
has matters well in hand.

35
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,950
Nevertheless, l...
What on earth is that?

36
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,437
Good morning, General.
l received your message, Mrs Hobday.

37
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,273
- l assume my parcel has arrived.
- lt's in the office.

38
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,395
How lovely.

39
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,598
- Who is that?
- Miss Price. Splendid woman.

40
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,875
Her late father served with me.

41
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,520
What does she burn in this?
lt smells like sulphur.

42
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,751
Ridiculous! One can't make
motor fuel out of sulphur!

43
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:53,470
Here we are. Another object from
Professor Emelius Browne in London.

44
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,518
- Thank you.
- ls it what you expected?

45
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:01,628
- l imagine so.
- He sent you a cat last time.

46
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,912
- Professor Browne is well?
- l haven't the faintest idea.

47
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,878
Are we to have
the pleasure of meeting him?

48
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,872
l doubt it. l don't know
Professor Browne personally.

49
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,997
- Was there something else?
- Yes. Would you come this way?

50
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,640
- l'm very anxious to get home.
- Come along, please.

51
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:24,832
- Get down, Charlie. l want a ride!
- Bash him one!

52
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,911
Stop it this instant!

53
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,669
Children, this is Miss Price.

54
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:34,150
Carrie, Charles and Paul Rawlins,
all the way from London.

55
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,356
- How do you do?
- How are you, miss?

56
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:40,638
The government are trying to evacuate
children into the country.

57
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,871
- Very sensible.
- Today they sent us 45.

58
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:47,794
And l've had to find homes
for all of them at very short notice.

59
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:55,036
These are the last three. All right,
children. Pick up your things.

60
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,078
You're not suggesting l take
these children into my house?

61
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,199
- Exactly.
- That's quite out of the question.

62
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,271
Children and l don't get on.

63
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:08,111
l'll believe you, miss.
Come on. Back to London.

64
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,599
Be quiet.

65
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,310
Besides, l have important work to do.

66
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,358
Miss Price, you do have
that entire house to yourself.

67
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,797
According to the Ministry of
Civil Defence, you have no choice.

68
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,108
l see.

69
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,668
lf that is the case
l shall take them into my house,

70
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:27,548
with the understanding that you find
another home as soon as possible.

71
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,358
Fine. Come along.

72
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,632
Good morning, Miss Price.
There they are!

73
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,518
Oh, Miss Price, what a charitable
thing you are doing,

74
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,034
taking in these
poor unfortunates from the city.

75
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,715
- Hold this very carefully.
- l wonder if l may drop by later.

76
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,270
- Why?
- Consider their spiritual needs.

77
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,318
That won't be necessary.
They won't be with me for long.

78
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,150
My parcel, please.

79
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,231
Bring your things inside.

80
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,914
- Bit murky, ain't it?
- Yeah.

81
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,037
Not another house
round here for miles.

82
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,833
- Wipe your feet.
- Big place, this.

83
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,718
- Who else lives here?
- l live alone.

84
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,711
lt suits my purpose.

85
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,960
All right. Come along, everybody.

86
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,155
Sorry, miss. The cat startled us.

87
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,152
No need for alarm.
You just frightened him.

88
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,998
Yeah, he's scared to death.
You can see that!

89
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:07,469
- What do you call your cat?
- l don't give animals silly names.

90
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:11,633
l call him Cosmic Creepers
because that's the name he came with.

91
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,792
You will sleep in here.
This was my father's bedroom.

92
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,030
Be very careful of everything in it.

93
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,839
- You boys take the bed there.
- All right, miss.

94
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,876
- What was your name?
- Carrie, miss.

95
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,077
- You sleep in the sofa in there.
- Thank you, miss.

96
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:28,516
- ls that all you brought?
- We ain't exactly burdened down.

97
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,795
Travel light, that's us.

98
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,676
l don't think this is going to work

99
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,830
but it seems
that l have no alternative.

100
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,990
We'll do our best, miss.
Really, we will.

101
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:41,152
Thank you, Carrie.
The bathroom is along the landing.

102
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,437
- Supper is at 6:00. You will wash...
- Wash?

103
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,637
You will wash yourselves
otherwise there will be no supper.

104
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,950
ls that clear?

105
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,670
A house of horror.
That's what we've come to.

106
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:05,199
Please don't bother to whisper.
l'm exceptionally keen of hearing.

107
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,350
You are planning
to run back to London.

108
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,635
Please do your plotting elsewhere

109
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,472
where l shan't have to listen to it.

110
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,160
l don't know much
about what children eat.

111
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,151
You'll have to make do as l do.

112
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,629
ls there anything in particular
that you fancy?

113
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,314
Sausage and mash,
bubble and squeak,

114
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,311
toad in the hole, fried fish...

115
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,913
Anything at all.

116
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,958
You won't find any fried foods
in this house.

117
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,678
- No fried food?
- No.

118
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,876
How do you keep your health?

119
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,598
Cabbage buds, rosehips,

120
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:38,754
hyssop seed, elm bark,
wattle yeast and stewed nettles.

121
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,678
''Dear Madam. With this shipment,

'apprentice witch'.''

''Yours faithfully, Emelius Browne.''

127
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,830
My first broom.

128
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,996
Time to go. Everybody up.

129
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,270
Wake up, Paul.
We're going back to London.

130
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,950
Let's see how we fly this thing.

131
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,671
Here we are.

132
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,953
''Clasp the broom with both hands.''

133
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,716
Yes, of course.

134
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,315
''Never astride the broom.''
Oh, yes, of course.

135
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,836
''A witch is always a lady unless
circumstances dictate otherwise.''

136
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,310
''Take an easy, graceful
sideways position.''

137
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:41,871
Of course, that's much better.
An easy, graceful sideways position.

138
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,952
There we are. How's that?

139
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,273
''To start up the broom,
your basic formula:

La kipo necriff scrumpet leech!''

141
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,430
l wasn't ready!

142
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,997
Now watch this.

143
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,439
Here we go.

144
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,629
lt's going to be
a little different this time.

145
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,548
All right. l know it's not ladylike.

146
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,191
What's the matter?

147
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,710
- How does she do that?
- She's a witch.

148
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,360
That's the sort of thing witches do.

149
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,234
She don't fly good, do she?

150
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,957
- She's crashed!
- Now's our chance to hop it!

151
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,589
- Suppose she's hurt.
- Go on! You can't hurt a witch.

152
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,919
Look out!

153
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,593
She's proper cross now.
Let's get away from here.

154
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,956
Hang on. l'm having a bit of a think.

155
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,917
A witch she is, says you.

156
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,514
Then let's use the old loaf, says l.

157
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,036
- Let's get back to London.
- What we have here is an opportunity.

158
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:55,430
She don't want anyone
to know she's a witch, does she?

159
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:58,512
- Not ruddy likely.
- That's the opportunity.

160
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,558
And l intend to make
the most of it. Come on.

161
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,828
- Bran porridge.
- Thank you, miss.

162
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,911
Very healthful, l'm sure!

163
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,956
- Hurt your foot, Miss Price?
- Just twisted my ankle.

164
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:15,032
- Sorry to hear that.
- Thank you. lt's nothing serious.

165
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,673
Lovely weather for flying last night.

166
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,675
Why did you say that, Charles?

167
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,718
Game's up, Miss Price.
We know what you are.

168
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,638
l see.

169
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,397
Don't worry, Miss Price.
No one's gonna peach on you.

170
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:42,599
Thank you. l should be most grateful
if you didn't tell anyone.

171
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:46,639
Course there would have to be one
or two little changes made round here.

172
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,315
l mean, l'd like to see an occasional
sausage on the table here.

173
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,960
- A bit of strawberry jam.
- Charlie!

174
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:56,237
Let me handle this.
And another thing, Miss Price.

175
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,108
There will be no more of this wash,
wash, wash, morning and night.

176
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,270
Anything else?

177
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:05,716
Now you mention it,
l could do with a bit of lolly.

178
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,152
Lolly?

179
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,674
Cash. Cold, hard cash.

180
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:13,035
You must have buckets of it.

181
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:17,352
The most accomplished of witches
can't make money out of thin air.

182
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,034
Have you ever heard of a rich witch?

183
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:24,398
Be that as it may,
you don't want us to blab, do you?

184
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,438
Have you considered
what danger you might be in?

185
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,239
l am a witch, you know.

186
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,471
What will you do?
Turn me into a toad?

187
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,949
Lovely. A toad with pink eyes.

188
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,714
- l might just do that.
- Go on, then. l dare you.

189
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,233
Very well, Charles.

190
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:48,276
- You shouldn't have said that to her.
- She don't frighten me.

191
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,191
She can't even ride a proper broom.

192
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,350
Excuse me, Charles.

193
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,193
Filigree, apogee,

194
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,477
pedigree, perigee.

195
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,070
Oh, Charlie!

196
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,389
That's better than a toad!
That's a rabbit!

197
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,040
Bother! l never seem
to be able to manage toads.

198
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,990
Stop! Leave him alone!

199
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:20,430
- Don't let Charlie get hurt.
- My spells don't last very long.

200
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,272
l'm just an apprentice witch.

201
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,196
Look out, Charlie!

202
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,711
You flaming brute!

203
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,917
l'll teach you to do that to me!

204
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,958
Let Cosmic Creepers alone.
Weren't his fault.

205
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,873
l'm afraid it's my fault.

206
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,190
Bad enough not being able
to manage a broom.

207
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,352
l can't perform
a simple, basic spell.

208
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,274
You dared her to do it.
l don't see why we can't all be friends.

209
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,749
Maybe she's not a wicked witch.

210
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,751
Of course l'm not!

211
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,957
- See?
- lf only l could trust you.

212
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:16,749
You see, the work l'm doing
is so important to the war effort.

213
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:20,355
- How do you mean?
- l mean exceptionally important.

214
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,158
Most secret.

215
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,314
What do you say, Charlie?
We can keep a secret.

216
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,790
Yeah. lf someone
made it worth our while.

217
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,909
l don't follow.

218
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,754
Simple. You give us something
valuable to seal the pact.

219
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,434
Oh, Charlie,
don't try to be clever again.

220
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,476
lt's for our own protection,
ain't it?

221
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:43,553
lf we broke the pact, we'd have
to give back the valuable object.

222
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,677
l think it's an excellent idea.

223
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:51,595
l wonder what l could give you.
Would you settle for one of my spells?

224
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,796
Bet that's not worth much.

225
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,516
Come with me.

226
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,789
- l like you better as a rabbit.
- Shut up, you.

227
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,552
Well, l never had a rabbit.

228
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,875
Careful what you touch in here.

229
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,076
Rum sort of place, ain't it?

230
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:18,517
When l signed for my witchcraft
course there was a free bonus,

231
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:22,354
a marvellous travelling spell
if you paid in advance.

232
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,556
l think l'll give you that one.

233
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,029
- ls it valuable?
- Certainly.

234
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,829
Poisoned dragon's liver?

235
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,349
You mean you poison the dragon
or just the liver?

236
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:41,671
lt comes prepared.
lt's part of the school equipment.

237
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,320
Here we are. The travelling spell.

238
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,391
Everybody gather round.

239
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,277
All right now. Let's see.

240
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,920
Does any one of you have
a bracelet or a ring?

241
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,833
- Something that you can twist.
- No, Miss Price.

242
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:59,435
- What about you, Paul?
- Always carry a few things around.

243
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,911
Never know when they might come
in useful. Piece of blue glass.

244
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,797
Lovely bit of string.

245
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,797
Horseshoe nail.

246
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,759
What's that?

247
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,274
Knob from the bed upstairs.

248
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:18,353
- lt twists, don't it?
- Yeah. Twisted right off.

249
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,715
Yes, l think that will be all right.

250
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:24,031
Carrie, turn the light down
a little bit, will you?

251
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,913
Hellebore, henbane, aconite...

252
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,549
glow-worm fire, firefly light!

253
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,715
There. lsn't that pretty?

254
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,870
ls that all we get?

255
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:55,077
This knob will now work
the famous travelling spell.

256
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,720
And what's
the famous travelling spell?

257
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,268
- How does it work?
- You take this knob

258
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,271
and put it back on the bed upstairs.

259
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,794
Then turn it smartly
a quarter turn to the left

260
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,997
then in a firm, clear voice,
tell it where you want to go

261
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,116
and the bed will take you there.

262
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,189
Go on!

263
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,875
- Will it really?
- l see no reason to think otherwise.

264
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,474
Thank you for the lovely gift.

265
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:22,394
Sorry, but it belongs to Paul. He's the
only one who can work the spell.

266
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,755
- Me?
- Yes.

267
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,877
That's right. My knob, weren't it?

268
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,598
That's the way the spell works.

269
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,319
Nice mess he'll make of things.

270
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:37,193
Oh, bother.
You children run upstairs.

271
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,999
Don't try anything with the bedknob
till l get back.

272
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,591
''Dear Madam,
it grieves me to inform you

273
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:47,639
that we have been forced to close
down our College of Witchcraft.''

274
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,757
''This means that we shall not
be sending you the final lesson

275
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,149
in which you expressed
so much interest.''

276
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:59,750
- What's keeping you?
- l've had some very bad news.

277
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,910
ls there anything we can do?

278
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,036
No. No, thank you.

279
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,559
Yes.

280
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,200
Yes, there is something
that Paul can do.

281
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,475
- Me?
- l need the bedknob back.

282
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:16,111
- l must get to London.
- No. l want to go to the jungle.

283
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,395
Come with me, Paul.

284
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,115
Now, Paul.
Ridiculous as it may seem

285
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,509
to have to explain this
to a six-year-old,

286
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,910
- l do need your help.
- Go ahead.

287
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,514
l was expecting
a very important spell in the mail

288
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,990
from my teacher, Professor Emelius
Browne, and it hasn't come.

289
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,275
What's that got to do with my knob?

290
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,397
l must go to London immediately
and see Professor Browne.

291
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:47,634
With his help, we may be able
to bring this war to a successful end.

292
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,676
That is why l need the knob.

293
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,751
What is your decision?

294
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,196
Thank you, Paul.

295
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,954
l brought this for your hair.
lt may be windy.

296
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,951
Thank you. lt's ever so nice.

297
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,713
Paul, have you been
to the bathroom?

298
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,631
- Twice.
- Good.

299
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,950
Charles, put on something warmer.

300
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,076
The bed may travel quite fast.

301
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:19,118
l'm not going.
l'm staying right here.

302
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,077
But why?

303
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:25,950
All that rubbish about a travelling bed.
lt won't work. That's why.

304
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,713
Carrie, help me to pull the bed out.

305
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,951
We don't want to scratch the wall
when we take off.

306
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:35,358
How's a ruddy big bed like that
gonna get out of this room

307
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,671
with those little windows?

308
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:42,275
l don't know. There's a great many
things about magic that l don't know.

309
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,874
- We'll just have to find out.
- Lovely!

310
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,757
Just leave me out of it.

311
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,876
l don't fancy
making a fool of myself.

312
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:53,196
What's come over you lately, Charlie?
You're no fun any more.

313
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:57,239
Help me tidy up. We don't want
to go to London with an unmade bed.

314
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,914
- How old is Charles?
- Eleven, going on twelve.

315
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,120
l see. That's what my father used
to call the age of not believing.

316
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,077
What's that supposed to be?

317
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:11,675
<i>When you rush around</i>
<i>in hopeless circles</i>

318
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:16,038
<i>Searching everywhere</i>
<i>for something true</i>

319
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:20,272
<i>You're at the age of not believing</i>

320
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,432
<i>When all the make-believe</i>
<i>is through</i>

321
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,795
That's Charlie to a tee.

322
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:29,350
<i>When you set aside</i>
<i>your childhood heroes</i>

323
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,638
<i>And your dreams are lost</i>
<i>upon a shelf</i>

324
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:38,191
<i>You're at the age of not believing</i>

325
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:42,558
<i>And worst of all you doubt yourself</i>

326
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,153
Throw that away.

327
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:48,518
<i>You're a castaway</i>
<i>where no one hears you</i>

328
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:52,388
<i>On a barren isle in a lonely sea</i>

329
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,993
What's that? Poetry?

330
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,152
<i>Where did all the happy endings go?</i>

331
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:01,358
<i>Where can all the good times be?</i>

332
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,476
Everyone on the bed who's going.

333
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:07,235
<i>You must face the age</i>
<i>of not believing</i>

334
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:11,154
<i>Doubting everything you ever knew</i>

335
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,229
The knob.

336
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:16,711
<i>Until at last you start believing</i>

337
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:21,999
<i>There's something wonderful in you</i>

338
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,751
Lovely sentiment, l'm sure.

339
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,115
- Are you ready, Paul?
- Yes, Miss Price.

340
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,553
Repeat after me.

341
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:33,792
Take us to
Professor Emelius Browne...

342
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,829
Very good.

343
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:45,550
Headmaster, Correspondence
College of Witchcraft.

344
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,468
<i>..</i>of Witchcraft, London.

345
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:59,715
When l say go,
tap the knob three times

346
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,553
and turn it a quarter turn
to the left.

347
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,559
- Left...
- That's it.

348
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,712
We'd better hold on tight.

349
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,473
The behaviour of the bed
is something l'm not sure of.

350
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:15,120
Let me breathe a little.

351
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,954
All right, Paul. Ready? Go.

352
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:23,110
One... two... three...

353
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,997
- ls this London?
- Course it is!

354
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,516
- Smell that lovely sooty air.
- Marvellous, ain't it?

355
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,353
- Charles, are you convinced?
- Not yet l ain't.

356
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,715
l don't see no Professor Browne.

357
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,314
Neither do l.
You children look after the bed

358
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,516
while l make enquiries for Mr Browne.

359
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:39,918
- l told you this bed wouldn't work.
- Don't start that again.

360
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,835
lt didn't work. lt was supposed
to take us to Professor Browne.

361
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:49,599
- ''Professor Browne.''
- Come on!

362
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:02,994
Ladies and gentlemen,
gather round, please.

363
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,110
Please note the name:
Professor Emelius Browne.

364
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:11,476
l am here to divert, to amuse,

365
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,676
and, yes, even to help you.

366
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,991
- There he is!
- lt is not what things are...

367
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,311
lt is what they seem to be.

368
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,389
ls that not so?

369
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,115
That ain't the kind
of professor l expected.

370
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,670
l'm not sure it's the kind
Miss Price expected, either.

371
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:32,517
What effect a little smoke is...

372
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,831
with a dash of hocus-pocus

373
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,876
and the scent of burning...

374
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,960
and the scent
of burning sulphur in the air.

375
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,118
And now, for my next trick,
may l draw your attention

376
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,839
to this solid piece
of ordinary window glass,

377
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,992
framed in an ordinary
unprepared frame.

378
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:55,119
May l also draw your attention
to this perfectly ordinary steel nail.

379
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,236
Now l shall place the framed glass

380
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,276
in this brown, unprepared...

381
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,396
Unprepared, mark you...

382
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,869
Unprepared brown paper bag.

383
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:08,272
l shall now attempt to drive
the steel nail through the glass

384
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,794
without breaking the glass.

385
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,836
''lmpossible!'' l hear you say.

386
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,478
We shall see.

387
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,393
He ain't very good,
even if he is a professor.

388
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,074
l tell you what l'm going to do.
No, please don't go.

389
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:28,119
Don't leave now
and regret lost opportunities later.

390
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:40,476
You, young sir. Would you care
to warble like the storied nightingale?

391
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,869
With this inexpensive device,

392
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,396
you can charm the very birds
down from the trees, like so.

393
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,188
- How much?
- For you, sir, one penny.

394
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,276
One copper coin of the realm.

395
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,957
Carrie, l'm very surprised
at you wandering off like this.

396
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:10,396
We found him for you, miss.
We found Professor Browne.

397
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,040
Don't work. l've been cheated!

398
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,237
ls that Professor Browne?

399
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,595
lt is indeed, my dear.
How may l serve you?

400
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:24,755
Would you be interested in the mating
call of the Brazilian bird of love?

401
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,989
Very useful, eh?

402
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:30,959
You are the headmaster of the
Emelius Browne College of Witchcraft?

403
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:34,396
The late headmaster.
The college, alas, is now defunct.

404
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,835
Professor Browne,
l am one of your pupils.

405
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:41,357
My dear lady, you are indeed
an ornament to the college.

406
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,158
- Splendid.
- Not at all.

407
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,879
l was shocked when you
closed down the college

408
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,713
without that most important
last lesson.

409
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,792
l'm sorry, my dear. No refunds.
Look at your contract.

410
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:55,077
But l must have the spell
that comes with the last lesson!

411
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,276
The matter is closed.
l bid you good day.

412
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,590
l have an appointment at my club.

413
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,511
The matter is not closed!

414
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,398
- Don't let him get away.
- Righto!

415
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,310
Here we are.

416
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,630
Will you get this child off my leg?

417
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,188
Filigree, apogee, pedigree, perigee.

418
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,828
Now l trust you'll behave
more like a gentleman.

419
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,357
Look out!

420
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,351
There goes another rabbit.

421
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,953
What was all that about?

422
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,873
l changed you into a rabbit
with one of your own spells.

423
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:42,677
My spell? From my school?

424
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,796
Not one of your best spells.

425
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,952
lt doesn't last.
Some of your others are much better.

426
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,952
But l don't understand. My spell?

427
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,349
They were just nonsense words
from an old book.

428
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,351
They worked perfectly well for me.

429
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,800
They work for you?

430
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,995
Good woman! Some kind of destiny
has brought us together.

431
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,674
You got these spells
out of some old book, you say?

432
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,990
l changed them round a bit.

433
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:14,356
l gave them a bit
of my own style, as it were.

434
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:17,637
The old sorcerers did have
a bit of a tendency to waffle on.

435
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:21,759
But dear lady, l never thought
l'd meet somebody like you.

436
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,598
What a treasure.

437
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:27,831
Mr Browne, will you please
stick to the point.

438
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:30,434
l would like to see this book
immediately.

439
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,909
Certainly. lt's at my new town house.

440
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,389
Would you care
to join me for luncheon?

441
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:38,358
We can discuss my ideas
at the same time.

442
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,436
Thank you. We'd be delighted.
We shall all go together.

443
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:46,513
- On the bed?
- On the bed, Paul. Come along.

444
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,913
You go round the other side.
l always travel on the left.

445
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:56,269
Will you give the address
to Paul, please?

446
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,591
May l ask how we are going
to get there on this bed? Fly?

447
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,274
My dear Professor,
with your own travelling spell.

448
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,920
The one you gave with the course
as a bonus.

449
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,151
My travelling spell?
That works as well?

450
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,356
Just give the address, please.

451
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,356
8 Winchfield Road.

452
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,955
Bed, take us to 8 Winchfield Road.

453
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,795
Madam, is this vehicle safe?

454
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:33,398
Perfectly. A bit theatrical, perhaps,
but then most good spells are.

455
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,428
We're here.
l would never have believed it.

456
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,672
You must have given us
the wrong address. Do you live here?

457
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:17,354
ln fact, l do.
Temporarily, at any rate.

458
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,273
l found the front door open.
The house was deserted.

459
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,794
Everyone has left the neighbourhood.

460
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,110
Why should they do that?

461
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,832
This probably has
something to do with it.

462
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,311
Merciful heavens!

463
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,198
You should be terrified
at the very idea of living here.

464
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,511
You would have thought so.
l am by nature a little bit of a coward.

465
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,238
But then l pondered.

466
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,869
ln the perverse nature of things,
this diabolical object

467
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,076
is probably the best friend
l've ever had.

468
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:49,311
lt enables me, for the first time
in my life, to live like a king.

469
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,391
Shall we go in?

470
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,910
Rothschild '26. Noble, worldly-wise,

471
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,468
but with a charming
touch of innocence.

472
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,676
Mr Browne, the book. Where is it?

473
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,637
Dear lady, you are relentless.

474
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:07,838
The book is in the library. We shall
proceed there after our cheese and wine.

475
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,989
Why do you keep the curtains closed?

476
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:14,152
So that we may enjoy
the gentle glow of candle light.

477
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:17,915
More likely so's a copper don't peek in
and catch you hiding out here.

478
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,560
Why don't you
have a look round the house?

479
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,835
- l want to chat with Miss Price.
- May we?

480
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:25,434
Yes, run along.
But don't touch anything.

481
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,432
Remember, this house
does not belong to Mr Browne.

482
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,990
Mr Browne, where is that book?

483
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,799
l must have that spell
on substitutiary locomotion.

484
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:48,317
- What is it? A toy shop?
- No, it's a nursery.

485
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:52,359
- Ain't you ever seen a nursery?
- No. And neither have you.

486
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,992
Would you hold this, please?

487
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,635
What do you think of that?

488
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,800
- Well, l... don't know what to think.
- Miss Price.

489
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:59,510
Think how successful l could be with
an assistant who can really do magic.

490
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:05,315
Dear lady, have you ever considered
entering show business?

491
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,391
- The what business?
- The theatre!

492
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,675
Pantomimes, village fairs,
the seaside.

493
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,513
Brighton, Blackpool,
follies on the prom.

494
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,397
l have very important work to do.

495
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,153
Listen to me. We could make a packet.

496
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,310
<i>Let us strike a bargain</i>

497
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,833

498
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,876

499
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,474
<i>That will give your gift</i>
<i>the needed lift</i>

500
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,596
<i>You possess the know-how</i>

501
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,750
<i>And I command the show-how</i>

502
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:33,674
<i>Oh, how successful you could be</i>

503
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,557
<i>With me</i>

504
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,915
l'm afraid we're wasting
valuable time.

505
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,672

- Miss Price.

506
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,591

525
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,798
''lsle of Naboombu.''

526
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:58,589
- Can't be no such place.
- There is too such a place.

527
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:01,478
These pictures prove it, don't it?

528
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:06,269
Bit weird, ain't it?
Animals wearing hats and things.

529
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,232
l like it.

530
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:14,552
Now where is the book?

531
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,631
Well? Where is it?

532
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,112
At last, Mr Browne!

533
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:43,077
''The Spells of Astoroth.''

534
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:45,071
Of course.

535
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,833
Here's the travelling spell.
This is where you got it.

536
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,876
Does one's nose
have to twitch like this?

537
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,436
Oh, you're back, Mr Browne.

538
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,511
Miss Price,
a word about your tactics.

539
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,909
l don't mind being changed
into a hawk or a tiger

540
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,399
or something with dash.

541
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,916
But always a fluffy white rabbit?
lt's intolerable!

542
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:08,915
Here we are!
Substitutiary locomotion.

543
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:12,956
''The ancient art of...''

this force is five mystic words.''

''These words are...''

546
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,072
But the rest of the book is missing!

547
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,469
Now you see why
l closed down the college.

548
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:35,317
- But where are the other pages?
- Haven't the foggiest.

549
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:38,198
- Listen to me!
- l'm all ears.

550
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:41,716
You will be if you don't pay attention.
Where did you get this book?

551
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:45,713
l bought it from a street market.
There was a bit of unpleasantness.

552
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:48,473
He claimed that l'd given him
a dud coin. l ask you!

553
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,915
There was a sort of scuffle.
The book tore.

554
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,150
He got one half and l got the other.

555
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:56,630
- But where's the other half now?
- lt's probably been thrown away.

556
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:59,518
But if it still exists,
there's only one place to find it.

557
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:03,550
- Where is that?

Oh, yeah, play the drums.

613
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:37,152
Closing time!

614
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:45,311
Bye!

615
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:01,356
<i>Portobello Road</i>

616
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:05,073
<i>Portobello Road</i>

617
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:11,759
<i>Street where the riches</i>
<i>of ages are stowed</i>

618
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:16,755
<i>Anything and everything</i>
<i>a chap can unload...</i>

619
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:20,276
Hey, governor. Something
for the lady friend? Nylons?

620
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:22,191
- No, thank you.
- Petrol coupons?

621
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:24,157
- Chocs for the little 'uns?
- No.

622
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:27,073
How about one of these, mate?
Fell off the back of a lorry.

623
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:30,516
- Be a good chap and run away.
- Would you fancy this, then?

624
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,833
Now you have my undivided attention.

625
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:37,992
- What can l do for you?
- Get over to the Bookman right away.

626
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:40,640
He wants to see you. You too.

627
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:44,637
Who is the Bookman? And what right
has he got to order me about?

628
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:47,234
l think we'd better
ask questions later.

629
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:48,958
Excuse me.

630
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:56,277
Sorry, guv.
No one told me about the stairs.

631
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:58,749
Why didn't you
bring Scotland Yard, Swinburne,

632
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:00,831
and half the Household Cavalry
as well?

633
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:02,831
What's the bed for?

634
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:05,957
lt's a present for you.
That's what he said.

635
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:08,429
Nothing of the sort.
The bed belongs to me.

636
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,556
Except for this knob, which is mine.

637
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:14,474
Bookman, there's been bad blood
between us long enough.

638
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:17,677
Let this gift begin friendship anew.

639
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:21,070
- Draw the curtains. Lock the door.
- You'll be snug as a bug.

640
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:24,436
lsn't that the section of the manuscript
we've been looking for?

641
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:27,592
- Who is this person?
- Miss Eglantine Price.

642
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:29,830
A charming young woman
of my acquaintance.

643
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:33,037
Miss Price, l've been looking
for this other bit a long time.

644
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:36,351
Mr Swinburne told me you were
in the market making enquiries.

645
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:41,116
And here we are. l don't mind saying,
to see it all together at last...

646
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:44,954
- There isn't much l wouldn't do.
- Or haven't done, for that matter.

647
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:48,953
- Right, guv?
- You'll close your mouth, Swinburne.

648
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:51,349
ls that clear?

649
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:56,195
lt's all like a jolly detective story
or jigsaw puzzle, isn't it?

650
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:59,431
We're both after the same spell.

651
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:02,353
You have one clue, l have the other.

652
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:08,477
Yes, in that case, the sensible thing
seems to be for us to cooperate.

653
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:12,511
l assume you're looking
for the same thing l am.

654
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:13,874
May l?

655
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:18,558
This is quite a moment
for both of us.

656
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:23,075
''Substitutiary locomotion,

657
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:27,233
the lost miracle of the ancients.''
And so on and so forth.

658
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:28,673
Here we are.

659
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:32,992
''The spell which creates this force
is five mystic words.''

660
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:34,798
''These words are...

661
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:40,637
engraved on the star that was always
worn by the sorcerer Astoroth.''

662
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,995
But where are the words of the spell?

663
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:46,072
l assumed they'd be
in your half of the manuscript.

664
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:48,799
l thought they'd be in yours!

665
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:52,236
Once again, a dead end.

666
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:55,590
l shall never know the secret.

667
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:01,473
lsn't that old Astoroth?
And there's his star.

668
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:03,869
Pity it's so small
you can't read the writing.

669
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:06,838
- But why the animals?
- Towards the end of his life,

670
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:08,911
Astoroth kept animals in cages

671
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,151
in search for the spells that
would make them more like humans.

672
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:16,518
The legend is that finally the
animals rebelled at the experiment,

673
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:20,559
killed Astoroth
and stole many of his powers.

674
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:23,200
lncluding the star
with the spell on it.

675
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:26,636
Possibly.
They found a ship, sailed away

676
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:28,711
and were never heard of again.

677
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:32,509
However, there is a final notation
in my half of the book

678
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:34,909
saying that in the 1 7th century

679
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,912
a shipwrecked lascar
was taken from the sea

680
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,629
half mad with thirst
and exposure to the sun.

681
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:47,078
Before he died, he swore he had seen
an island ruled by animals.

682
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:48,388
Where?

683
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:53,349
There is,
l regret to say, no such island.

684
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:55,715
l looked for it in every chart.

685
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:59,270
The lsle of Naboombu does not exist.

686
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:01,954
lt does too! Got my own...

687
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,309
- What is he trying to say?
- Nothing!

688
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:08,233
When he don't say nothing,
he mumbles.

689
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:10,834
l wish the child to speak!

690
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:15,634
- Now you've done it.
- There is too such a place.

691
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:20,713
Got my own book. There.
Real pretty letters, ain't it?

692
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:25,119
- Let me see it.
- You're not interested, Bookman.

693
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:28,033
- lt's just a children's book.
- l'll be the judge of that.

694
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:29,553
- Give it to me.
- No.

695
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:32,757
Please don't annoy me.

696
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:36,037
- Give me the book, boy.
- Not likely.

697
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:39,753
Bit of a stalemate, isn't it?

698
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:46,308
lf it's all the same to you,
l'd rather use my own.

699
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:49,039
Sentiment, you know.

700
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:51,111
Come along, Paul. lt's time to go.

701
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:55,079
Go? How, my dear? The door is locked.

702
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:58,311
Observe the fundamental weakness
of the criminal mind.

703
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:01,437
- You will believe no one or anything.
- l understand.

704
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:04,239
- The knob, Paul.
- Course you do, my dear.

705
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:07,630
We can tell them the complete truth.
They will believe nothing.

706
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,516
He's up to something, you know.

707
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:14,957
Before your very eyes, l shall cause
this bed and the occupants on it

708
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:17,031
to disappear.

709
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:20,715
l should like to see a cheap-jack
tenth-rate entertainer

710
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:22,597
do a trick like that.

711
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:24,272
''Cheap-jack entertainer.''

712
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:26,749
- That was naughty.
- All right, Paul.

713
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:29,391
- Where to?
- To the lsland of Naboombu.

714
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:32,677
- l'm very curious about that place.
- Good.

715
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:35,320
Bed, take us
to the lsland of Naboombu.

716
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:43,268
Enough of this nonsense!
Get the book!

717
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:21,268
Beastly climate.
l never did fancy the sea.

718
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:24,752
- Where are we?
- Naboombu, of course.

719
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:27,559
l've never seen
no island like this before.

720
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:30,757
l'm afraid we may have
fallen into the lagoon.

721
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:34,150
That's right.
Here we are on page three.

722
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:43,318
Oi, Mr Codfish!

723
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:47,757
Hello, young fellow!
Welcome to Naboombu Lagoon.

724
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:51,677
Now l'm hearing things.
Fish don't talk.

725
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:54,236
Not too bright, is he?

726
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:57,915
- He's my brother.
- Oh? Sorry.

727
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:01,160
Mr Codfish,
where is the lsland of Naboombu?

728
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:04,312
You mean the land part? Oh, that.

729
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:07,153
Straight up. You can't miss it.

730
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:09,470
None of my business, of course,

731
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:12,870
but l shouldn't go there
if l were you.

732
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:16,714
- Having troubles, they are.
- Troubles?

733
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:19,837
He's right, you know.
A lot of trouble.

734
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:22,388
Trouble or not,
we should be getting along.

735
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:25,153
- l wish to see who is in charge.
- What's the rush?

736
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:28,312
lt's really rather splendid
down here. For you, my dear.

737
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:30,879
Thank you.

738
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:39,311
How pleasant...

739
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:40,833
<i>Bobbing along</i>

740

750
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:26,633
<i>Think we're rather odd?</i>

01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:51,795
<i>Where we get along swimmingly</i>

766
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:56,998
<i>Far from the frenzy</i>
<i>of the frantic world above</i>

767
01:01:57,080 --> 01:02:00,914
- <i>Two beneath the blue</i>
- <i>Could even fall in love</i>

768
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,150
<i>Bobbing along, singing a song</i>

769
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:08,314
<i>On the bottom</i>
<i>of the beautiful briny sea</i>

770
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:11,829
<i>Bobbing along, singing a song</i>

771
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:17,552
<i>On the bottom of the beautiful briny,</i>
<i>shimmery shiny</i>

772
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:21,235
<i>Beautiful briny sea</i>

773
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:25,515
Bravo!

774
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:28,876
Most exciting, most exciting.

775
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:32,350
You've won the ruddy cup.

776
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:56,629
Help!

777
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:11,711
This time l really caught a whopper!

778
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:24,192
People! Oh, no!

779
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:26,077
What scurvy luck.

780
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:28,833
- My goodness!
- l'll deal with this, my dear.

781
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:31,718
- Don't you know that...
- Good day, captain.

782
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:34,155
l used to be a bit
of a seafaring man myself.

783
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:36,629
Many's the time
l've shipped out of Portsmouth.

784
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:39,154
Delighted to meet a fellow mariner.

785
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:42,517
Now stow it, mate.

786
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:46,388
- Oh, really!
- Can't you read reading?

787
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:52,316
lt says... ''No peopling allowed.''

788
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:57,072
- Ridiculous!
- Don't antagonise him, Mr Browne.

789
01:03:57,160 --> 01:04:01,995
That means l've got to throw you
all back. That's what to do.

790
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:06,312
Wait it minute! lt says here
that anybody can see the king.

791
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:09,710
- And that's the law.
- Where do it say that?

792
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:11,677
Here in my book.

793
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:14,951
So it do.

794
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:19,549
But if you people knew
what was good for you,

795
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:23,076
you'd get yourselves
all throwed back.

796
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:25,913
The king don't like people!

797
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:30,392
Nonetheless, we must see the king
on an urgent personal matter.

798
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:32,198
Please lead the way.

799
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:37,229
But just don't say
l didn't warn you. See?

800
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:40,550
Follow me.

801
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:05,669
Get out of here!

802
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:17,158
Yes. What can l do for you?

803
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:20,516
l caught some people
down at the sea lagoon.

804
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:22,989
They want to see the king.

805
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:28,359
Really? Well, we can't be bothered
with that sort of thing now, can we?

806
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:32,638
l don't know that l fancy this.

807
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:36,398
His Majesty is in a frightful rage.

808
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:39,880
Excuse me, sir.
As an all-round entertainer,

809
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:43,430
l am considered not without talent.
Perhaps l can cheer him up.

810
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:47,593
No, no. You don't understand.

811
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:49,591
As everyone knows,

812
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:54,356
His Majesty is
the world's greatest soccer player.

813
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:01,514
But due to a technical problem,

814
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:04,876
the Royal Cup match
cannot take place today.

815
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:08,635
And His Majesty
had so set his heart on it!

816
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:13,953
Throw these... creatures
back into the sea.

817
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:16,516
Aye, aye, sir.

818
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:18,955
Just a moment! l can help!

819
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:22,555
Do you really think so?
l'd be most grateful.

820
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:25,234
Do you know soccer?

821
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:27,436
Do l know anything about soccer?

822
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:30,478
Why, l was captain of Tottenham
Hotspurs for two years.

823
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:32,710
Three seasons
with Manchester United...

824
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:34,597
Yes, yes. You'll do.

825
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:37,148
Come this way, please.

826
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:40,632
Mr Browne,
are you certain you'll be all right?

827
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:47,790
Now what?

828
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:50,030
Not an ideal person
in many respects,

829
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:53,078
but Mr Browne is a very brave man.

830
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:59,239
Do you think he's done for?

831
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:06,915
Do you think so?

832
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:15,551
l can't tell you how
l appreciate this.

833
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:19,235
For some reason
we have great difficulty

834
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:23,279
finding referees round here.

835
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:26,511
lf there be one thing we like,

836
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:30,912
it's volunteers, eh, Birdy?

837
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:36,155
He's a proper king!
Look at his crown!

838
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:38,879
What's he got round his neck?

839
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:43,036
What a magnificent... ornament, sire.

840
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:45,998
Ah, yes.

841
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:49,914
Wouldn't be without it.
Been in the family for years.

842
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,594
The Star of Astoroth!

843
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:58,350
You're to sit
in His Majesty's royal box.

844
01:07:58,440 --> 01:08:01,989
No littering, no chewing, no fruit
or wrappers or sweets. Please.

845
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:14,394
Rise, please.

846
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:18,390
Loyal fans,

847
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:21,597
this is official.

848
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:26,879
We have a volunteer referee.

849
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:42,795
Let the match begin!

850
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:47,275
He's still wearing it!

851
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:49,874
Right, Dirty Yellows,
let's have a clean game.

852
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:55,115
Right, True Blues, best foot forward.

853
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:32,636
Weird sort of game they play here.

854
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:13,835
Hurry up! Get rid of it!

855
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:36,479
Gracious!

856
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:41,029
You're doing fine, matey.

857
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:48,470
Move it around.

858
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:51,957
Get on with the match!

859
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:10,358
- Foul!
- They're only animals.

860
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:13,000
That's no excuse for dirty football.

861
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:42,716
Ref, are you blind?

862
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:45,951
Be quiet, Charles!
Don't forget who the referee is!

863
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:08,359
- Don't they have no rules?
- Course they do.

864
01:12:08,440 --> 01:12:10,351
The king makes them up
as he goes along.

865
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:55,718
Poor Mr Browne.
Do you think he's all right?

866
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:58,637
Well, he's moving.

867
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:02,112
Steady, matey. Move it around.

868
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:11,830
He almost had it then.

869
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:32,314
Looks like he's done for this time.

870
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:54,479
Don't just stand there! Head it in!

871
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:35,714
Stop... that... ball!

872
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:11,437
Goal!

873
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:15,638
Game's over. l win.

874
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:23,874
Let me give you a hand, matey.

875
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:26,872
That's quite all right, Your Majesty.
Thank you so much.

876
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:29,758
Please, let me help you
on with your robe.

877
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:32,195
Why, yes. Thank you.

878
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:34,794
Can't have you
catching cold, sire, can we?

879
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:36,472
Why, no.

880
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:39,472
Have you ever heard of something
called the gypsy switch?

881
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:41,676
No, can't say that l have.

882
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:43,751
Remind me to
tell you about it some time.

883
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:46,195
l can't tell you when
we've had such a good time.

884
01:15:46,280 --> 01:15:49,795
We'll carry your memory
in our hearts for a long while.

885
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:52,075
l think it's time to leave.

886
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:54,952
Must you go?

887
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:57,190
Must be dashing. Marvellous game.

888
01:15:57,280 --> 01:15:59,111
Lovely to see you. Goodbye.

889
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:05,320
Friendly lot.

890
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:10,520
Don't mind them visiting.
Wouldn't want them living here.

891
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:15,793
- Come along, children.
- Hurry up.

892
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:25,268
Stop gibbering!
What's the matter with you?

893
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:27,955
Your Royal Star!

894
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:30,952
They've stolen your Royal Star!

895
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:35,310
Don't be ridiculous.

896
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:37,516
What do you think this is?

897
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:50,869
Why didn't you say so?

898
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:54,239
Paul, put the knob on the bed.

899
01:16:56,360 --> 01:17:02,037
At last the magic words.
Treguna mekoides trecorum satis dee.

900
01:17:02,120 --> 01:17:04,429
l'll keep it.
Women always lose things.

901
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:11,550
- Hurry, Paul! The knob!
- lt's stuck!

902
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:17,237
- l suppose l'd better do something.
- Please do. Quick.

903
01:17:19,080 --> 01:17:21,071
Got it.

904
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:25,711
Filigree, apogee, pedigree...

905
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:33,150
Oh, bother. l do hate shoddy work.

906
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:00,834
l shall never get used to this thing.

907
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:03,593
Will you push the bed
back into place, please?

908
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:06,240
l think we could all
do with a nice cup of tea.

909
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:09,073
No time. l've gone to a lot
of trouble to find this spell.

910
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:11,515
l'm going to try it immediately.

911
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:15,756
Mr Browne, kindly let me
have your shoes, please.

912
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:19,474
- Fine.
- What's the shoes for?

913
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:22,597
lf you'd been paying attention
l should think you'd be aware

914
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:26,753
that substitutiary locomotion is the art
of causing inanimate objects

915
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:29,912
to take on a life force of their own.

916
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,833
l must have inanimate objects
to experiment with.

917
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:34,638
Makes sense, don't it?

918
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:38,717
Stand back, everyone.
l need plenty of room.

919
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:46,232
l want you all
to be absolutely quiet.

920
01:18:47,080 --> 01:18:49,958
Mr Browne, you have
the Star of Astoroth, l believe.

921
01:18:50,040 --> 01:18:52,349
Oh, yes. lt's in my nice clean hanky.

922
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:00,872
lt's all right, Mr Browne.

923
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:03,520
l should have realised
that it would be impossible

924
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:05,909
to take an object
from one world into another.

925
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:14,228
lf only l would have had the sense
to remember the words on that star.

926
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:18,518
- l know the words.
- Don't bother her. She's thinking.

927
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:21,353
Why don't you and l nip out
and get something for supper?

928
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:24,637
And l might conceivably
call into the pub for a pint

929
01:19:24,720 --> 01:19:26,756
to steady my nerves.

930
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:30,878
l do know the words, Miss Price.

931
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:33,918
How can you know the words
when Miss Price doesn't?

932
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:40,159
<i>Troop movements and massing</i>
<i>of barges in French and Dutch ports.</i>

933
01:19:40,240 --> 01:19:42,390
<i>The prime minister</i>
<i>has told the nation</i>

934
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:45,233
<i>to be on the alert for signs</i>
<i>of a possible invasion.</i>

935
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:47,072
<i>That was the news.</i>

936
01:19:47,160 --> 01:19:49,674
l might have been able
to do something about this.

937
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:51,557
lt's out of your hands now, my dear.

938
01:19:51,640 --> 01:19:54,438
lf only l could have remembered
those words. lt's maddening.

939
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:57,036
Why don't someone ask me?

940
01:19:57,120 --> 01:20:01,636
Come off it, Paul. You can't remember
those kind of words.

941
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:07,431
You mean like ''Treguna mekoides
trecorum satis dee''?

942
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:13,356
- How do you know that?
- Easy.

943
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:15,874
Says so right here in my book.

944
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:22,716
You mean it was there
in your book all the time?

945
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:25,030
Yeah. But nobody ever listens to me.

946
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:29,358
Treguna mekoides

947
01:20:30,040 --> 01:20:32,793
trecorum satis dee.

948
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:36,391
Nothing happened!

949
01:20:38,440 --> 01:20:40,078
Am l doing something wrong?

950
01:20:40,160 --> 01:20:42,469
Well, it does seem
a bit old-fashioned.

951
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:45,074
After all, we are
in the 20th century.

952
01:20:46,160 --> 01:20:48,674
- What do you suggest?
- lt needs rhythm. Tempo.

953
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:51,638
Music.
As l always say, do it with a flair.

954
01:20:51,720 --> 01:20:54,109
- Do you mind if l have a go?
- Of course not.

955
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:57,988
Come along, you lot!
We need all the help we can get.

956
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:02,312
Treguna mekoides trecorum satis dee.

957
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:09,955
<i>Substitutiary locomotion</i>

958
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:14,397
<i>Mystic power that's far</i>
<i>beyond the wildest notion</i>

959
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:19,076
<i>It's so weird, so feared,</i>

<i>Substitutiary locomotion come to me</i>

961
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:25,879
Now!

Treguna mekoides

<i>I don't want locomotiary substitution</i>

- <i>Trecorum satis dee</i>

973
01:23:02,640 --> 01:23:05,200
Mr Browne, what is going on here?

974
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:07,475
l haven't the foggiest.

975
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:09,835
How do you do?

976
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:11,148
Shall we?

977
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:13,913
- That's my nightgown!
- ls it really, my dear?

978
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,116
l'm not responsible
for its behaviour.

979
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:18,430
Obviously not, my dear.

980
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:22,709
Paul, what on earth are you doing?

981
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:25,189
Having a jolly good time,
that's what.

982
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:28,718
- How can we stop all this?
- Must we? lt's most agreeable.

983
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:30,074
But we must do something.

984
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:32,549
Didn't l give you
my all-purpose cut-off spell?

985
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:34,358
- Lesson number eight.
- Eight.

986
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:37,591
- Yes, number eight l think it was.
- Oi! My Sunday trousers!

987
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:45,073
Buzz off, old chap.
Find your own dancing partner.

988
01:23:58,120 --> 01:24:00,156
Be careful, Carrie! Slow down!

989
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,673
Mr Browne, will you please
control your shoes?

990
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:13,150
Dear lady, l very much fear
that we have nothing under control.

991
01:24:32,760 --> 01:24:34,716
Do you mind?

992
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:54,750
Now, who would like some more
of my lovely sausages and mash?

993
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:57,195
- No more for me, thank you.
- Carrie?

994
01:24:57,280 --> 01:24:59,635
l've already had two helpings.

995
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:01,836
- l'm full.
- Me, too.

996
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:05,675
At least somebody wants some.

997
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:14,073
Cheer up, my dear. This should
be something of a celebration.

998
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:17,755
l'm sorry, but there doesn't
seem to be much to celebrate.

999
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:21,719
- l still haven't mastered that spell.
- Of course you have.

1000
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:24,917
You just need a little more practice.

1001
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,230
- Do you really think so?
- No doubt about it.

1002
01:25:27,320 --> 01:25:29,754
Meantime, there's nothing
to liven the spirits

1003
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:32,274
like a little master juggling.
Right, Charlie?

1004
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:34,794
Go on then, guv!
Give us some juggling!

1005
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:45,872
Very few better than me at this.
All you need is 20 years' practice

1006
01:25:45,960 --> 01:25:48,474
and a touch of genius.

1007
01:25:57,960 --> 01:26:00,110
Never happened to me before.

1008
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:03,590
l don't usually juggle
with cats under my feet.

1009
01:26:06,040 --> 01:26:07,837
Look! She's laughing!

1010
01:26:25,320 --> 01:26:27,959
- Mrs Hobday. Do come in.
- l can't stop, my dear.

1011
01:26:28,040 --> 01:26:30,873
l've just come by
to bring you the good news.

1012
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:33,952
Mr Bistlethwaite,
who brings the milk, you know?

1013
01:26:34,040 --> 01:26:36,076
He's promised
to take the children in!

1014
01:26:36,160 --> 01:26:39,914
He and his wife have got that farm.
Just the place for growing children.

1015
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,594
Put a bit of colour
back in their cheeks.

1016
01:26:42,680 --> 01:26:45,877
Why, what's the matter?
l thought you'd be pleased.

1017
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:49,714
You told me yourself that you had
no time to take care of children.

1018
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:54,436
Circumstances have changed somewhat.

1019
01:26:54,520 --> 01:26:57,592
We got a dad now. Mr Browne.

1020
01:26:57,680 --> 01:27:01,468
- Paul!
- Miss Price, is this true?

1021
01:27:01,560 --> 01:27:05,917
Of course. You do want him to stay
with us, don't you, Miss Price?

1022
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:10,154
l suppose
l hadn't really thought about it.

1023
01:27:10,240 --> 01:27:13,789
What about him?
What do you say about it, Mr Browne?

1024
01:27:15,560 --> 01:27:19,599
lt's all rather sudden!
l don't quite know what to say.

1025
01:27:20,520 --> 01:27:22,511
Then l'll leave you two
to talk it over.

1026
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:25,672
l'll come back in the morning!
Good night!

1027
01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:36,077
lt is true, Mr Browne. You are going
to be our father now, aren't you?

1028
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:42,876
We are rather rushing things,
aren't we?

1029
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:48,233
Perhaps Mr Browne has other things
besides you children to think about.

1030
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:54,158
Yes. As a matter of fact
l should have left ages ago.

1031
01:27:54,240 --> 01:27:57,118
l must get a train
back to London tonight.

1032
01:27:57,200 --> 01:27:59,760
lt's rather an important matter.

1033
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:03,549
l'd like to tell you about it,
but it's a little bit hush-hush.

1034
01:28:03,640 --> 01:28:05,198
Sort of a secret.

1035
01:28:07,160 --> 01:28:10,277
Well... if...

1036
01:28:10,360 --> 01:28:14,797
lf l've been any sort of help to you,
l'm pleased.

1037
01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:17,634
You've been immensely kind.
Thank you.

1038
01:28:18,360 --> 01:28:20,920
l've enjoyed being with you.

1039
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,150
Perhaps it's been good for all of us.

1040
01:28:23,240 --> 01:28:25,151
Will you be coming back?

1041
01:28:25,240 --> 01:28:28,630
Some day, my dear. l certainly hope
that we shall meet again.

1042
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:32,156
Some day.
When all this war business is over.

1043
01:28:33,320 --> 01:28:36,756
- l see.
- Perhaps l shall realise my dream.

1044
01:28:36,840 --> 01:28:40,435
Eglantine and Emelius:
illusionists extraordinary!

1045
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:42,829
Just think how that
will look on the poster.

1046
01:28:44,040 --> 01:28:46,190
The children are going to miss you.

1047
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:50,668
- You really think they will?
- Yes.

1048
01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:54,352
Well, l shall miss you. All of you.

1049
01:28:57,960 --> 01:29:00,394
lf l don't go now
you might never get rid of me.

1050
01:29:03,160 --> 01:29:04,991
Goodbye, Carrie.

1051
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:09,428
- Must you really go?
- l think it's best for everybody.

1052
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:12,910
- Goodbye, Paul.
- l think you should be our father.

1053
01:29:13,640 --> 01:29:15,073
Goodbye, Charlie.

1054
01:29:15,160 --> 01:29:17,674
Do you want me to come down
to the station with you?

1055
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:22,629
No, no. You stay here
and look after everybody.

1056
01:29:25,320 --> 01:29:28,790
- Goodbye, Miss Price.
- Goodbye, Mr Browne.

1057
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:21,429
- When is the next train to London?
- Lord bless ye, ain't no train.

1058
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:23,954
Not until milk job,
4 a.m. tomorrow morning.

1059
01:30:24,040 --> 01:30:27,112
- Mind if l await it here?
- Suit yourself. Good night, sir.

1060
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:29,316
Good night.

1061
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:52,115
Out you go, Cosmic.

1062
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:00,838
Hello?

1063
01:31:16,360 --> 01:31:19,511
<i>Emelius Browne, do you know</i>
<i>you could be warm and cosy</i>

1064
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:21,875
<i>in that house at this very moment?</i>

1065
01:31:21,960 --> 01:31:26,192
<i>For once in your useless life,</i>
<i>you really seem to have been needed.</i>

1066
01:31:26,280 --> 01:31:29,113
<i>You're a failure, Emelius Browne,</i>

1067
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:31,077
<i>and a coward.</i>

1068
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:36,029
No, <i>Frulein,</i> this is not
the invasion, just a little exercise.

1069
01:31:36,120 --> 01:31:40,238
A minor raid to induce panic
and to spread a little mischief.

1070
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:42,436
When you English get it
through your head

1071
01:31:42,520 --> 01:31:45,830
that the German forces can land
whenever and wherever we please,

1072
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:48,275
perhaps you will consider
reasonable peace.

1073
01:31:48,360 --> 01:31:50,874
Not bloody likely!

1074
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:53,315
Go on, Miss Price. Do it to him.

1075
01:31:53,400 --> 01:31:56,233
l must say, it's very tempting.

1076
01:31:56,320 --> 01:32:00,552
Colonel, how would you feel
about being turned into a white rabbit?

1077
01:32:02,720 --> 01:32:06,395
l said, how would you feel
about being turned into a white rabbit?

1078
01:32:07,960 --> 01:32:09,473
Be quiet, please.

1079
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:14,710
Filigree, apogee, epogee...

1080
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:19,950
- Not again!
- Your memory, Miss Price.

1081
01:32:22,200 --> 01:32:24,919
Would you kindly fetch my notebook
from the workroom?

1082
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:26,115
Righto.

1083
01:32:30,640 --> 01:32:33,029
Silence!

1084
01:32:33,960 --> 01:32:35,473
We have work to do.

1085
01:32:35,560 --> 01:32:38,120
l am sorry, but l must send
all of you some place

1086
01:32:38,200 --> 01:32:40,430
where you will no longer
be a nuisance.

1087
01:32:51,080 --> 01:32:53,833
<i>As the words sell the tune</i>

1088
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:56,388
<i>And the moonbeams the moon</i>

1089
01:32:56,480 --> 01:33:00,871
<i>All I need to succeed in my plan</i>

1090
01:33:01,960 --> 01:33:07,398
<i>Is a champion rare</i>
<i>with a flourish and a flair</i>

1091
01:33:42,360 --> 01:33:43,998
Eglantine!

1092
01:35:09,640 --> 01:35:12,996
Where's the spell for rabbits?
The easiest of all, she said.

1093
01:35:14,720 --> 01:35:18,474
Confound it, can't women ever learn
to file things properly?

1094
01:35:24,280 --> 01:35:25,269
Here it is.

1095
01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:28,989
Filigree, apogee, pedigree, perigee.
That's it.

1096
01:35:34,080 --> 01:35:36,071
Filigree...

1097
01:35:36,160 --> 01:35:39,357
apogee, pedigree, perigee.

1098
01:35:46,240 --> 01:35:51,109
Come along. For once in your life,
you've got to believe in something.

1099
01:35:51,200 --> 01:35:52,758
That's it. Good lad.

1100
01:35:53,920 --> 01:35:58,357
Filigree, apogee, pedigree, perigee.

1101
01:36:26,640 --> 01:36:30,474
What's the use of putting us
in that draughty castle?

1102
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:32,152
lt's quite chilly.

1103
01:36:32,240 --> 01:36:36,279
The colonel believes when a British
female decides to become a nuisance,

1104
01:36:36,360 --> 01:36:38,874
she can become
the greatest nuisance in the world,

1105
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:41,474
and l'm inclined to agree with him.

1106
01:36:42,120 --> 01:36:43,678
You need a lesson in manners.

1107
01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:47,196
lf l had my notebook,
l'd make certain you'd learn a few.

1108
01:37:01,360 --> 01:37:03,237
Jumping Jehosophat! More Jerries!

1109
01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:16,914
Take it easy, can't you?

1110
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,389
- Try holding your breath.
- l am holding it.

1111
01:37:19,480 --> 01:37:23,029
We could strip him down
and grease him with soap.

1112
01:37:23,120 --> 01:37:27,511
No, it's no good. We can't do it.

1113
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:30,398
l could have told you that
in the first place.

1114
01:37:32,840 --> 01:37:36,833
lf we can't get Paul out we'll just
have to think of something else.

1115
01:37:36,920 --> 01:37:39,514
What about that spell
that makes things move about?

1116
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:43,036
- But l'd need weapons.
- How about all these things?

1117
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:47,120
l'm afraid they're a bit ancient.

1118
01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:51,790
- Where did this come from?
- lt's Mr Browne!

1119
01:37:51,880 --> 01:37:55,316
He's on his way to London.

1120
01:37:55,880 --> 01:37:56,869
Mr Browne?

1121
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:02,350
lf you are Mr Browne,
would you get off my lap?

1122
01:38:03,560 --> 01:38:06,393
lt is Mr Browne!

1123
01:38:07,440 --> 01:38:10,113
lt is you!

1124
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:12,873
You didn't think
that l could do that spell, did you?

1125
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:16,589
l am glad to see you!
But what about all these Germans?

1126
01:38:16,680 --> 01:38:19,877
What's wrong with
the substitutiary locomotion spell?

1127
01:38:19,960 --> 01:38:22,679
- That ought to be useful.
- lt isn't ready yet.

1128
01:38:22,760 --> 01:38:25,274
- You saw what happened.
- We have to chance it.

1129
01:38:25,360 --> 01:38:28,955
We can't let these so-and-sos
get away with their beastly little raid.

1130
01:38:29,040 --> 01:38:32,032
Won't you get up off the floor?
We'll go to work.

1131
01:38:50,320 --> 01:38:52,276
- Jolly good luck, my dear.
- Thank you.

1132
01:38:52,360 --> 01:38:54,590
Let's hope you haven't
forgotten the spell.

1133
01:38:54,680 --> 01:38:56,875
- Not this time.
- Found this in the castle.

1134
01:38:56,960 --> 01:38:59,997
Probably not magic,
but it might make you feel more at home.

1135
01:39:00,080 --> 01:39:02,594
Thank you.
That was very thoughtful of you.

1136
01:39:02,680 --> 01:39:04,989
Let's get out of Miss Price's way.

1137
01:39:11,760 --> 01:39:14,479
Treguna...

1138
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:17,632
mekoides...

1139
01:39:17,720 --> 01:39:19,438
trecorum...

1140
01:39:20,600 --> 01:39:24,070
satis dee.

1141
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:46,197
Look!

1142
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:36,631
Sound the advance!

1143
01:42:40,960 --> 01:42:42,712
Just in time for the kick-off.

1144
01:43:15,280 --> 01:43:16,759
Steady on the left.

1145
01:43:18,280 --> 01:43:22,193
Victory for England and St George!

1146
01:43:23,760 --> 01:43:25,478
Like a Lord Mayor's show!

1147
01:43:25,560 --> 01:43:27,437
Pikemen, hold your distance.

1148
01:43:27,520 --> 01:43:30,910
<i>Treguna mekoides</i>

1149
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:34,310
<i>and trecorum satis dee</i>

1150
01:44:05,400 --> 01:44:07,038
Blimey!

1151
01:44:38,840 --> 01:44:41,957
- Where's it coming from?
- Sounds like the sea road, sir.

1152
01:44:42,040 --> 01:44:44,474
Come on, lads! After me.

1153
01:46:15,320 --> 01:46:17,470
Good shooting, bowmen!

1154
01:46:24,360 --> 01:46:27,432
Well caught, sir. Very good.

1155
01:46:35,360 --> 01:46:37,476
Knock his block off! That's it!

1156
01:46:37,560 --> 01:46:40,711
Mr Browne,
make those children take cover!

1157
01:47:46,080 --> 01:47:50,119
Are you still there, Colonel?
l thought you'd be on your way by now.

1158
01:47:53,360 --> 01:47:57,638
You see? Things may not
be so easy for you after all.

1159
01:48:09,320 --> 01:48:11,038
Goodbye, Colonel!

1160
01:48:57,760 --> 01:48:59,113
Eglantine.

1161
01:49:00,360 --> 01:49:01,793
Dear Mr Browne.

1162
01:49:01,880 --> 01:49:05,919
- We thought they'd damaged you.
- See? No one can hurt Miss Price.

1163
01:49:07,880 --> 01:49:11,634
There they are, lads!
l said something was afoot!

1164
01:49:11,720 --> 01:49:14,188
All right. Drive them into the sea.

1165
01:49:14,280 --> 01:49:16,589
Firing positions. Both sides.

1166
01:49:22,320 --> 01:49:25,118
All right, men. Hold your fire.

1167
01:49:28,360 --> 01:49:30,828
l think we've taught
the Hun a lesson.

1168
01:49:30,920 --> 01:49:34,037
He'll think twice
before coming back here again.

1169
01:49:35,400 --> 01:49:40,076
lt's tragic. All your spells,
your equipment. All gone.

1170
01:49:40,160 --> 01:49:43,789
Still, l was able to perform
some small service first.

1171
01:49:44,560 --> 01:49:47,950
That mean you ain't gonna
be a witch no more? Never?

1172
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:52,079
No, Paul. l realised some time ago
that l could never be a proper witch.

1173
01:49:52,160 --> 01:49:55,869
Was it that first magic moment
when you laid eyes on me?

1174
01:49:55,960 --> 01:50:00,238
No. lt was the day
my poisoned dragon's liver arrived.

1175
01:50:00,320 --> 01:50:04,711
l knew that anyone who felt the way
l did about poisoned dragon's liver

1176
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:07,678
had no business being a witch.

1177
01:50:15,200 --> 01:50:18,158
- Certain you're doing the right thing?
- Well, l think so.

1178
01:50:18,240 --> 01:50:20,595
lt's much too dangerous
being a civilian.

1179
01:50:20,680 --> 01:50:22,511
Take care of yourself, guv.

1180
01:50:22,600 --> 01:50:26,275
l'll do that. And l'll be back
before you've grown an inch taller.

1181
01:50:26,360 --> 01:50:29,670
- We'll be together again.
- Sounds like you have an escort.

1182
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:37,670
Well, here we go.

1183
01:50:56,200 --> 01:50:59,078
- Permission to move off, sir.
- Carry on, sergeant.

1184
01:51:01,080 --> 01:51:03,514
Parade, by the right,

1185
01:51:03,600 --> 01:51:05,795
quick march!

1186
01:51:16,160 --> 01:51:21,314
Suppose that's it.
We ain't gonna have no fun no more.

1187
01:51:21,400 --> 01:51:23,550
Still got this, ain't l?

1188
01:51:31,040 --> 01:51:34,999
<i>Call out the navy,</i>
<i>call out the ranks</i>

1189
01:51:35,080 --> 01:51:39,278
<i>Call out the air force,</i>
<i>call out the tanks</i>

1190
01:51:39,360 --> 01:51:42,875
<i>From the cliffs of Dover</i>
<i>call up the gulls</i>

1191
01:51:42,960 --> 01:51:46,839
<i>And don't forget</i>
<i>the loyal territorials</i>

1192
01:51:46,920 --> 01:51:51,675
<i>But who's digging in here?</i>
<i>Who will defend</i>

1193
01:51:51,760 --> 01:51:55,799
<i>Every inch of England,</i>
<i>no matter what they send?</i>

1194
01:51:55,880 --> 01:51:59,634
<i>Who's standing firm</i>
<i>in our own front yard?</i>

1195
01:51:59,720 --> 01:52:03,508
<i>The soldiers of the Old Home Guard,</i>
