{10337}{10397}- Better hurry.|- What do you mean, man?
{10402}{10500}- lt was clockwork!|- Better hurry!
{10692}{10800}- Jesus Christ! What the fuck was that?|- A little insurance.
{10805}{10879}- What the hell for?|- No witnesses!
{11072}{11179}When l told them their organisation|wasn't cost-effective, they didn't listen,
{11184}{11253}so l felt the only way|to exploit my talents
{11258}{11320}was to branch out on my own.
{11325}{11386}- Mr...|- Davis.
{11391}{11519}Davis! Davis, Davis, that's right.|Jeff Davis. My point is this.
{11524}{11562}Much like yourself, l'm sure,
{11567}{11650}at an early age|l envisioned that my education
{11655}{11752}would be my saving grace,|give me that necessary edge.
{11757}{11804}Let me give you just one example.

{13266}{13307}lt's really so important.
{13312}{13360}- Can l call you Jeff?|- Whatever.
{13365}{13460}- Come on!|- Without a college degree,
{13465}{13526}a Masters at least,
{13531}{13582}a guy can become desperate.
{13587}{13671}- Might have to join the army.|- Turn to a life of crime?

{20378}{20444}Five dead. Nobody saw or heard anything.
{20449}{20501}Nothing new for this part of town.
{20506}{20592}Caine was first on the scene.|He didn't see anything either.
{20745}{20818}Jack, l'm sorry about Turner.
{20823}{20885}l really am.
{20929}{21011}l'm so pissed off, l could throw you|through a goddam window!

{21256}{21377}What about Victor Manning?|He killed my goddam partner!
{21382}{21481}You disappeared for eight days!|A week l could understand,
{21486}{21535}but eight fuckin' days!
{21561}{21702}On top of all that, you've got to answer|for the stolen heroin, plus the 500 grand!
{21707}{21780}Captain Malone?|There's somebody here to see you.

{22277}{22368}- ls that an order?|- No, worse.
{22373}{22422}Promise me.
{22427}{22519}Caine, you're the only man l know|who'd rather die than break his word.
{22524}{22630}- So promise me, and that's an order.|- l want Manning!
{22635}{22712}Take the vacation,|or l'll make it permanent!
{22802}{22847}Fine.
{22877}{22913}Good.
{22957}{23125}Oh, and if l were you, l'd take a little time|and patch up my personal life, too.
{23363}{23468}Detective Caine,|this is Agent Switzer of the FBl.
{23473}{23579}- He'd like to ask you a few questions.|- ln private.
{23939}{24001}Do you know what l do, Detective?
{24024}{24073}l know things.
{24078}{24178}That's all. That's my whole job.|To know things before anyone else.
{24183}{24258}- So?|- l know you were after Victor Manning.
{24263}{24340}l also know|that these are no ordinary murders.
{24394}{24470}Three men had their throats cut|before drawing their weapons.
{24475}{24577}- Who could possibly move that fast?|- Not who. What.
{24582}{24681}l've seen a lot of knife wounds.|This was something different.
{24686}{24761}- You think the weapon's the key?|- Yes, l do.
{24824}{24935}- Know where l can locate Mr Manning?|- Look, l'd like to help.
{24940}{24997}But l was just put on vacation.
{25002}{25064}Or didn't you know that?
{25196}{25269}- Put Caine back on the case.|- Like hell l will!
{25330}{25391}l'd have to make one phone call.
{25438}{25487}You don't want that.
{25514}{25594}Well, Caine can't. He's going on vacation.
{25599}{25699}- lsn't that right, Caine?|- l said l'd go. l didn't say when.
{25726}{25823}- Fine. You heard him, you're on it.|- Good.
{25828}{25886}l'll send his partner over tomorrow.
{25893}{25946}Partner?
{25951}{26006}- Partner.|- Caine, meet Special Agent Smith.
{26011}{26087}- You're kidding, right?|- Cool it, Caine!
{26092}{26208}Mr Caine, l'm the youngest man|ever to reach my rank at the Bureau.
{26213}{26325}l make twice as much as you do,|so don't start that shit with me.
{26330}{26363}You are kidding.
{26368}{26487}Commander Switzer asked me to lay out|some parameters for you.
{26492}{26567}- Parameters?|- Sort of general guidelines...
{26572}{26641}- l know what the word means.|- Oh, good.
{26646}{26760}We will report to lnspector Switzer daily.|That means every day.
{26765}{26837}- No disappearing, not for a week...|- Eight days.
{26842}{26926}..not for a minute.|Are we in agreement here?
{26931}{26992}- You think...|- l know!
{26997}{27109}- Captain, the coroner's here.|- Thanks, Dee. Send her in.
{27152}{27195}- Hi.|- Hi.
{27217}{27289}What did Ballistics say about the weapon?
{27294}{27343}lt was razor-thin and razor-sharp.
{27348}{27442}lt made a deep incision|l'd have trouble making with a scalpel.
{27447}{27535}- How do you explain that?|- l can't.
{27661}{27723}- Diane?|- Look, l feel bad about Ray.
{27728}{27832}As bad as you do. But eight days,|Jack, and not even a phone call.
{27837}{27934}- Would you stop and listen?|- l don't want to hear it!
{27967}{28034}Hey, l like abuse as much as the next girl.
{28039}{28122}But this time, wondering|whether you were dead or alive,
{28127}{28232}l was kind of rooting for dead,|you know what l mean?
{28250}{28302}Diane... Hey!
{28311}{28384}Pretty healthy relationship|you've got there.
{28389}{28442}That's one.
{28574}{28661}- OK, number one on my list.|- We're going to the crime scene.
{28666}{28720}We should read the coroner's report first.
{28725}{28788}''Exploit experts.|Their expertise is essential.''
{28797}{28918}Page 35 from the Switzer manual.|You could learn a lot from him.
{28923}{29018}Can we go now, or does Switzer|have some other tips for me?
{29023}{29102}You sure you want to go|with that particular look?
{29107}{29189}Give it some thought.|External things are very important.
{29194}{29277}They tell people who you are.|Know what l mean?
{29328}{29436}ln that case,|maybe you should ride in the trunk.
{29744}{29815}Christmas. Big deal!

{31612}{31669}What the hell are you doing?
{31698}{31788}- l'm observing, taking notes.|- Really?
{31793}{31903}The problem with most police work|is you become emotionally involved.
{31908}{31979}This way l can achieve a little distance.
{31984}{32047}You want distance? Stand over there.
{32052}{32103}By the body.
{32108}{32195}- So it's all clinical? What about instinct?|- No such thing.
{32200}{32273}lnstinct is just a set of learned responses.
{32278}{32397}l've studied what to do in almost|any situation. l'm ready for anything.
{32402}{32498}- Go downstairs.|- ls there a point to all this, or what?
{32503}{32589}- Downstairs!|- Jesus Christ!
{32594}{32742}So, Agent Smith, what happens when you|run into something completely new?
{32747}{32813}l wouldn't know. lt hasn't happened yet.
{32818}{32875}You're stuck now.
{32893}{32946}Yeah, maybe.

{56307}{56448}Extra caffeine. Lousy American coffee|couldn't keep a hamster up at night.
{56453}{56544}- Who's the suit?|- Smith here's a real, live FBl agent.
{56549}{56636}- Caine, are you nuts?|- Relax, l'm not here for that.
{56641}{56743}- lt's all essential to my research.|- l believe you.
{56748}{56800}You Feds are all alike.
{56805}{56856}You're just like that tribe in Africa.
{56861}{56996}One that says the opposite to what they|mean. ''Welcome!'' Then they kill you!
{57001}{57113}- You've got nothing to worry about!|- See?
{57118}{57199}Calm down, Bruce. Tell us about the disc.
{57257}{57295}OK.
{57389}{57473}- Jesus Christ! Be careful, will you?|- Relax, G-man.
{57478}{57588}ln a field void of charge like the one|l've created, it simply hovers.
{57593}{57648}ln simplest terms, it's a magnet.
{57653}{57745}The most powerful self-contained|electromagnet l have ever seen.
{57750}{57878}- lt can be attracted to other magnets...|- That's why it stuck to the speaker.
{57883}{58022}..and programmed to use other magnetic|forces as a means of propulsion.
{58027}{58123}- You can use any frequency.|- So how's it used as a weapon?
{58128}{58181}The human body|carries a small electrical charge.
{58186}{58249}You tune the disc to the charge, and then...
{58270}{58435}Flathead's basically correct.|lt's like turning your radio dial to K-l-L-L.
{58440}{58576}- lncredible! l need more time to study it.|- Fine, keep it. We'll be back.
{58581}{58704}- l'm taking that thing to Switzer now.|- That thing almost took my head off!
{58709}{58766}- You can't take it!|- Really?
{58771}{58886}- You wouldn't get ten feet.|- Let him finish, then take it to Switzer.
{59013}{59090}Ah, yeah, fine. Fine.
{59190}{59268}- Hide it!|- You got it!
{59345}{59418}Three more like him came in last night.
{59423}{59502}- What links them to our case?|- Cause of death.
{59507}{59623}Massive heroin overdose.|This guy was no addict. Look.
{59628}{59702}lt's definitely not self-induced.
{59707}{59811}- The Feds' heroin?|- l think so. The potency was incredible.
{59816}{59930}Your psycho stole a lot of heroin|to kill people with.
{59935}{59994}Why would he do that?
{59999}{60093}People do a lot of sick things|to each other.
{60098}{60144}What about the bullet hole?
{60149}{60231}- lt's not a bullet hole.|- What is it?
{60236}{60316}l'm about to find out. Wanna stick around?
{60382}{60431}No, thanks, l'll pass.
{60436}{60524}l'm just gonna make a phone call|or something.
{60580}{60622}Sorry!
{60702}{60764}Doctor Schaeffer to Pathology...
{60808}{60869}- Come on.|- l'll call you back, sir.
{60874}{60960}- Got kinda stuffy in there, you know?|- Caine!
{60965}{61049}- This came for you about an hour ago.|- Thanks.
{61054}{61138}What's with you two?|Kind of a love-hate thing?
{61143}{61229}- More a hate-hate thing.|- What's that?
{61234}{61334}''Dear Caine, having a great time in Rio.|Wish you were dead. Love, Victor Manning.
{61339}{61399}''P.S. l told Warren to look you up.''
{61404}{61483}- Who's Warren?|- Look at that bastard smiling!
{61488}{61568}- He kills my partner, then goes to Rio!|- So who's Warren?
{61573}{61658}Manning's partner, head of the White Boys.|Yuppie criminals.
{61663}{61742}- l've been after him for two years.|- Where are we going?
{61747}{61819}- To see Warren before he sees us.|- OK.
{61824}{61892}- What did you say?|- l said OK.
{61983}{62017}Oh, shit!
{62022}{62108}- How well do you know this area?|- A little.
{62113}{62187}- Let me drive.|- No way. lt's my car. l'm driving.
{62192}{62289}Really? Two members of the White Boys|are following us.
{62294}{62395}- Let me take the wheel.|- l said l'm driving.
{62465}{62521}On second thought, you go ahead!
{62660}{62709}Turn right.
{62745}{62833}- Goddammit! What are you doing?|- Short cut. Ever hear of those?
{62838}{62934}- Stop fuckin' around! Get some backup.|- l know what l'm doing!
{63043}{63138}- Shit. Where'd you get that?|- Present from my mother. Look out!
{63439}{63546}- We're not playing chicken!|- Last thing a White Boy wants...
{63551}{63614}- ..is a scratch on his car!|- l got 'em!
{63644}{63719}- Son of a bitch!|- That's it!
{63724}{63783}Warren's a dead man.
{63900}{63977}- Where are we? ls this Warren's?|- Yep.
{63982}{64089}We have to follow procedure, Caine.|We have to get a warrant.
{64094}{64171}- Now!|- Nope. Now l don't care.
{64319}{64416}(car alarms)
{64560}{64607}Car alarm! Come on!
{64793}{64842}Goddammit!
{65129}{65161}Hey...
{65423}{65460}Shit!
{65500}{65534}Next.
{65539}{65628}What's the latest on the LVO transfer?
{65633}{65712}- Not here. The carpet!|- Sorry!
{65717}{65786}Guns on the table.
{65807}{65889}- Come on, boys!|- Do it!
{66000}{66052}All right. Now get up.
{66096}{66161}l said get up!
{66259}{66337}OK, Warren.|Now you and l are gonna have a talk.
{66371}{66431}(Warren) Nice to see you again, Caine.
{66436}{66487}Just sit down, Warren.
{66555}{66679}You shouldn't have come here. Victor|didn't want to go to Rio till next month.
{66684}{66730}Place is packed.
{66735}{66832}- He had to fly coach!|- l didn't kill your boys, Warren.
{66837}{66899}- Bullshit!|- You're after the wrong guy.
{66904}{66974}For some reason,|you cops have called a drug war.
{66979}{67077}What, did we forget a payment|or something?
{67082}{67160}Our sales have gone|straight into the crapper.
{67165}{67237}- No bonuses this quarter!|- Drug war?
{67242}{67301}What the fuck are you talking about?
{67370}{67464}Why, why, why|am l even talking to this cop?
{67472}{67522}'Cause you're gonna kill him!
{67528}{67581}Oh, right.
{67586}{67686}Nothing personal, Caine. Just business.
{67691}{67848}- You're forgetting who's got the gun.|- l think l can come up with some leverage.
{67957}{68018}(laughter)
{68023}{68115}All right, Caine,|you've got two things to consider.
{68120}{68170}Come on, man, move it!
{68178}{68287}One, Victor wanted you dead|by the close of business today.
{68326}{68401}Two, we have a drop to make.
{68406}{68501}l ought to call it off, but we have|a serious cash-flow problem,
{68506}{68567}so you're going to do it for me.
{68572}{68658}lf anybody's gonna be killed,|l guess it's gonna have to be you.
{68686}{68718}Forget it.
{68723}{68784}Oh, you'll do it.
{68789}{68917}Or else you'll start to get|a very bad reputation for losing partners.
{69750}{69853}- You understand the drill, right?|- Just give it to me.
{69883}{69938}No mistakes, pal.
{70042}{70107}Hope you guys understand|you're in a lot of trouble.
{70234}{70300}(man speaks Chinese)
{70498}{70557}Yes, sir, what can l do for you?
{71113}{71171}Don't be foolish.
{71229}{71282}Tell the White Boys to kiss my ass!
{72118}{72170}(growls)
{72597}{72639}Come on!
{73271}{73358}What the fuck was that?|Goddammit, what happened?
{73374}{73423}Who was that?
{73515}{73599}- What's going on?|- Just shut up and let me think!
{73608}{73658}Who's this?
{74260}{74354}You're gonna tell me|what happened out there right now!
{74359}{74446}Just wait here and we'll go back|for the disc later.
{74451}{74517}Oh, fine, you go right ahead|and take your time!
{74522}{74646}Don't worry about me, l'm just here|at your goddam beck and call!
{74651}{74761}Mm-hm. l think so. Yeah. Maybe.
{74766}{74840}Excuse me, young lady,|emergency call, FBl.
{74845}{74932}You're not gonna believe|what just happened!
{74958}{75049}Thank you.|Do you have change for a dollar?
{75103}{75194}Hmm. l always thought|l'd be the one to wring your neck.
{75199}{75267}Cute. You wanna answer my question?
{75293}{75366}Yeah. Roughly speaking,
{75371}{75471}heroin stimulates the pituitary|to make endorphins,
{75476}{75572}a hormone that creates|an incredible sense of well-being.
{75577}{75626}Nature's Ecstasy.
{75654}{75717}So if you shot somebody up,|drilled a hole, and...
{75722}{75842}Theoretically, you'd have your hands|on a nearly perfect drug.
{75847}{75920}- Why theoretically?|- There's no way on earth to do it.
{75925}{76075}Nobody has the technology to preserve|or administer the stuff. Not yet, anyway.
{76734}{76827}Let me run it by you again, Operator.|l wanna place a collect call.
{76832}{76883}No, a collect call.
{76950}{76990}Hey...
{77063}{77113}You're gonna think l'm crazy.
{77120}{77220}Don't let that stop you.|lt hasn't yet, you know.
{77342}{77437}We're dealing with aliens,|and not from Mexico! Two of them.
{77442}{77527}One's the killer,|and the other one's on our side.
{77532}{77586}Listen, you work very hard.
{77591}{77691}Your mind and body require a rest|or they break down.
{77696}{77796}- l need you to listen to me.|- You need a psychiatrist, Jack!
{77843}{77893}Somebody had to be the first.
{77898}{77990}The first what, huh?|The first person to see aliens?
{77995}{78075}You don't have proof.|No one's gonna believe it.
{78080}{78133}l got the disc.
{78169}{78218}Come on.
{78405}{78437}Bruce?
{78605}{78637}Jesus!
{78739}{78798}What happened?
{78820}{78875}What do you think happened?
{78880}{79029}- The bastards stole the disc.|- Your pal! l knew this would happen!
{79034}{79135}l tried to lie. l swear it. They knew l had it.
{79140}{79231}- (sighs) Are you all right?|- l feel like l look.
{79236}{79309}- You look like shit!|- Look who's talking!
{79314}{79385}- Do you know who they were?|- l don't know.
{79390}{79446}Troglodytes with bad haircuts.
{79495}{79547}Looked like you, actually.
{79552}{79601}Why don't you shut up?
{79606}{79695}Terrific. Our one piece of evidence,|and it's gone!
{79700}{79772}What are you looking at?
{79867}{79962}- We're going to Malone.|- (laughs) lt's your career. Go ahead.
{79967}{80084}You gonna tell him we're fighting|drug dealers from outer space?
{80416}{80477}No shit, man, he had to be seven feet tall!
{80482}{80535}l saw him two blocks down the street.
{80540}{80635}Sure you did. Last week you saw|Jimi Hendrix at the laundromat.
{80640}{80703}Right. With a dryer full of tie-dyed shirts!
{80708}{80825}Man, there's a crazy motherfucker|running around... Oh, shit!
{80830}{80897}- Stay cool.|- That's him. That's the guy.
{81022}{81086}- l come in peace!|- Sure you do, tall guy!
{81091}{81141}Leave him alone!
{81168}{81218}Shit, what the fuck you doin', man?
{82553}{82622}- You're gonna back me up, right?|- Absolutely.
{82627}{82679}- Promise?|- No problem.
{82684}{82753}- Say what?!|- l agree with you, sir, l agree 100%%%.
{82758}{82857}- Caine is jumping to conclusions.|- You spineless son of a bitch!
{82862}{82918}- Are you testing me, Jack?|- lt's true!
{82923}{83001}Then bring me some proof!|That disc you say you found.
{83006}{83059}- Somebody stole it.|- Yeah, sure!
{83085}{83134}Malone here. Yeah.
{83139}{83218}What? Where?
{83238}{83287}How many?
{83292}{83325}Yeah.
{83360}{83413}Your boy just killed two more people.
{83418}{83468}This time we have a witness.
{83473}{83603}Dee, tell Harper, Portland|and Mulroney to meet me at this address.
{83611}{83713}- Thanks!|- l've got a career to think about!
{83718}{83773}lf you can't help, stay out of my way!
{83778}{83835}- lnspector Switzer says...|- That's two!
{83906}{83979}How many do l get?
{84661}{84739}- Why can't you understand...|- l'm the goddam coroner!
{84744}{84807}lf l'm not authorised personnel, who is?
{84812}{84896}- l can't help you!|- l don't want you to help me!
{84901}{84975}Why am l talking to you?|You're Neanderthal.
{84980}{85048}There's no reason to get personal.
{85053}{85131}- What's going on here?|- Oh, Jack, thank God! This...
{85136}{85224}- Asshole?|- Thank you. This asshole won't let me in.
{85229}{85345}There are corpses in there|and l can't see the bodies.
{85350}{85425}- Detective Caine.|- The crime scene has been sealed.
{85430}{85505}l'll handle this, please.|What's the problem?
{85510}{85599}- Smith, FBl.|- You can all put your wallets away.
{85604}{85674}You're not getting in there!
{85679}{85753}- l think we are!|- l think not!
{85890}{85942}Come on.
{85979}{86080}- Frank, what's going on here?|- They got the place completely...
{86085}{86187}- l thought you were an FBl guy.|- l've never seen them before!
{86192}{86260}lsn't that your boss?
{86265}{86303}Yeah.
{86348}{86411}l'd like to talk to him. Dr Switzer!
{86416}{86465}Oh, it's OK. Let him through.
{86670}{86727}Where's that witness you were talking...?
{86732}{86827}There is no witness. Listen to me.|Don't talk, just listen!
{86832}{86882}lt's all taken care of.
{86887}{86946}This case is closed. As of this moment,
{86951}{87018}you are officially on vacation. Now beat it!
{87023}{87164}- What does ''taken care of'' mean?|- lt means it's not our problem any more.
{87212}{87266}Get out of here!
{87830}{87884}Excuse me. Diane?
{87889}{87954}Come here for a second.
{87959}{88016}l've been put on vacation.
{88021}{88079}How about taking a trip?
{88084}{88185}A long one, just you and me.|Someplace we never heard of.
{88190}{88266}- What about my job, Jack?|- Take a vacation too!
{88271}{88367}- l can't.|- Then quit! Look at this!
{88372}{88502}- Don't tempt me, Jack. l'll do it!|- Go home, pack, then pick me up.
{88507}{88613}- Are you serious about this?|- l promise. Cross my heart!
{88809}{88917}Jack, mess with me on this one,|l'll have your lungs filled with water.
{88922}{88955}Hey.
{89020}{89060}Hey.
{89065}{89171}Hey! What's the matter,|aren't we friends any more, huh?
{89176}{89265}- Well, l guess that's it, huh?|- What did Switzer tell you?
{89270}{89320}- The whole story.|- Bullshit!
{89325}{89405}- l know what l need to know.|- All right, that's three!
{89410}{89511}You know the difference between you|and me? You don't fucking care!
{89516}{89602}- You just want to please.|- Fuck you! l do my job!
{89607}{89669}l respect my superiors,|that's the difference.
{89674}{89761}- l'm a team player.|- Well, your team sucks.
{90035}{90088}(wheezing)
{90187}{90221}Holy shit!
{90267}{90319}He must be stopped!
{90362}{90478}You've some balls! Give us a second.|l never, ever wanna work with you again...
{90483}{90561}- Holy shit!|- Calm down! He's the one l told you about.
{90566}{90649}- Look! Look!|- He's on our side.
{90819}{90871}Let's get the hell out of here.
{90919}{90960}Holy shit!
{91750}{91812}Oh, man, he's bleeding.
{91894}{92001}- Who are you?|- An officer of the law, like you.
{92006}{92091}- He speaks English!|- Stop him!
{92096}{92205}- What does he want?|- Blarcy, a priceless drug.
{92210}{92265}Where l'm from,
{92270}{92370}rare and illegal, what you call endorphins.
{92375}{92474}- Just a lousy dealer!|- l don't believe any of this is happening!
{92479}{92589}He'll kill your people by the thousands|to get it cheaply.
{92594}{92677}- Where did you say you're from?|- Stop him!
{92682}{92744}lf he returns, others will come.
{92749}{92807}lt will be a slaughter.
{92812}{92907}He's at the storage place. Destroy it!
{92977}{93026}Near Quarterway.
{93031}{93157}- Could be the Fletcher building.|- You must promise me.
{93266}{93321}Promise me!
{93326}{93386}l promise.
{93584}{93655}At least we have something now,|you know?
{93660}{93746}- What?|- His body. We've got proof.
{93782}{93886}(groaning)
{94162}{94263}Shit! Goddammit! l got it.|Nothing much of him left.
{94268}{94383}- Christ! Did you see that?|- Almost burned my fuckin' face off!
{94388}{94466}- You all right?|- l'm all right. l got it!
{94471}{94524}l got his weapon.
{94529}{94577}Great. That's our proof.
{94582}{94694}- We take it to Malone and...|- lnspector Switzer has to see it first.
{94699}{94798}- Forget Switzer!|- You think Malone's gonna stop it?
{94803}{94903}- Switzer will stop it.|- No, he won't! Switzer is a liar.
{94908}{94988}Pretty soon he'll feed you that old line
{94993}{95074}about breaking eggs to make an omelette.
{95079}{95166}- Now, give me the gun.|- No.
{95171}{95255}- What do you mean, no? Come on!|- l said no!
{95260}{95312}Sorry, Jack. l'll use it.
{95317}{95423}You stupid fuck! You've been|a pain in the ass since the start.
{95428}{95477}Sorry you feel that way.
{95482}{95564}l'm taking this to Switzer.|l'm just doing my job.
{95569}{95607}Are you?
{95612}{95687}We're the good guys, Jack.
{95692}{95805}Somewhere along the line|you just forgot that. Know what l mean?
{96593}{96644}- You OK?|- Yeah!
{96649}{96682}Good.
{96687}{96748}Don't worry, you did the right thing.
{96753}{96851}You did a fantastic job|and your record will reflect that.
{96856}{96942}- First the disc and now this.|- What happens now, sir?
{96947}{96996}How is this going to be handled?
{97001}{97092}l'm surprised at you|asking so many questions.
{97097}{97187}- Been around Caine too much, l guess.|- No.
{97192}{97301}Well, suffice it to say that this will be|applied to the national interest.
{97306}{97385}That's something|l wanted to talk to you about, sir.
{97390}{97463}l won't ask you to remove Caine.|You've done enough.
{97468}{97561}Remove him? What are you talking about?
{97566}{97613}Don't be naive!
{97618}{97734}The military benefits of a successful|contact with this alien are enormous,
{97739}{97835}and cannot be compromised by Caine,|who just wants to kill it!
{97840}{97925}As far as you're concerned,|this case is closed.
{98089}{98140}This alien's killing people.
{98221}{98320}Can't make an omelette|without breaking a few eggs.
{98381}{98432}Don't worry.
{98472}{98532}You get used to this kind of work.
{98603}{98646}Trust me.
