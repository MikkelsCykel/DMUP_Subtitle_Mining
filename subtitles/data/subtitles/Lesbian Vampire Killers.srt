<i>Centuries ago,
during the dawn of the red moon...</i>

2
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:49,240
<i>...our peaceful hamlet
was terrorised by a beast...</i>

3
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,520
<i>...born not of man, but spewed forth...</i>

4
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:58,640
<i>...from the fieriest pits of Hades...</i>

5
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,880
<i>...with an evil fuelled by
a hatred of men and a love of women.</i>

6
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:08,840
<i>Its name: Carmilla, the vampire queen.</i>

7
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,960
<i>No one could defeat her, save one man:</i>

8
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:17,400
<i>A baron away for decades
fighting in the Crusades.</i>

9
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,880
<i>Upon his return, the baron found
that Carmilla's desires...</i>

10
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,000
<i>...had ensnared his beautiful wife, Eva...</i>

11
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,720
<i>...and turned her into a lover
of the vagine.</i>

12
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,680
No!

13
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,160
<i>Consumed with vengeance,
the baron pledged to destroy Carmilla...</i>

14
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,000
<i>...and flee the village.</i>

15
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,520
<i>He unearthed the sacred
Books of Nekros...</i>

16
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,120
<i>...where he discovered
the only way of slaying...</i>

17
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:46,480
<i>...this unholy harpy, once and for all,
was to forge a sacred sword...</i>

18
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,760
<i>...a weapon blessed with
an ancient Babylonian hex...</i>

19
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,920
<i>...and infused with his own blood.</i>

20
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:58,080
<i>Without fear,
he confronted Carmilla.</i>

21
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,720
<i>But before the baron
could strike the fatal blow...</i>

22
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,120
<i>Carmilla laid down a curse most vile.</i>

23
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,240
As you strike me down,
so you shall release evil...

24
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,520
...within me into your daughters
and your daughters' daughters...

25
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,480
...and they shall not rest
until your bloodline's ended.

26
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,160
They will know your breed
by these marks above your heart.

27
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,280
And when the life's blood
of the last of your line...

28
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,480
...mixes with that of a virgin girl...

29
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:36,520
I shall rise again, more powerful
than you will ever imagine.

30
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,240
<i>And with that,
he lopped her fucking head off.</i>

31
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,720
<i>Henceforth,
every woman in our village...</i>

32
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,120
<i>...upon her 18th birthday,
is turned by the curse...</i>

33
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,120
<i>...and reborn a lesbian vampire.</i>

34
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,480
<i>Our only salvation is a prophecy
that foretells of the day...</i>

35
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,160
<i>...when the last descendent
of the baron's bloodline...</i>

36
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,720
<i>...shall return to this hamlet and vanquish
Carmilla's curse forever.</i>

37
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,240
<i>That time... Has begun.</i>

38
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:12,360
- I'm not happy, Jimmy.
- Why? What did I do wrong?

39
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,400
Things are different now
to how they used to be.

40
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,880
I just don't love you anymore.
No, I love you.

41
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,400
I'm just not in love with you.

42
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,520
- You know I'll always love you.
- You say that every time you dump me.

43
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,560
I don't dump you, Jimmy.
I just take time out...

44
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,400
...to re-evaluate the parameters
of our relationship.

45
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,120
That's what makes us so strong together.

46
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,400
If we're that strong together,
why are you dumping me... Again?

47
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,400
I'm not dumping you. I just think
we're stronger together apart.

48
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,760
That doesn't make
grammatical sense, so...

49
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:51,040
Feel it with your heart,
and know what I'm saying is true.

50
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,440
- So... You are dumping me?
- No.

51
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,240
But, also in a sense, yes.

52
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,480
- Yes!
- Shit.

53
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,720
I'm not happy, Fletch.

54
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,920
I'm trying my best, Miss Rossi.

55
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,760
Your bestjust isn't good enough.

56
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,680
- What more do you want me to do?
- I don't know.

57
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,000
- This has to be the end of the line.
- What?

58
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,160
- What did I do wrong?
- You punched him in the face.

59
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,920
You know what I get like when people
mess with my shit. He had it coming.

60
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,560
He was seven.
You're a children's clown.

61
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,440
Old enough to know
not to go messing with my shit.

62
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,000
Fletch, you punched a child.

63
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,560
He was spraying me
with my own seltzer bottle.

64
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,440
- What was I supposed to do?
- Not hit him.

65
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,040
Then he shouldn't be spraying
my ball sac. It was only a tap.

66
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,600
- You gave him a bloody nose!
- I look like I pissed myself!

67
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,600
Christ, Fletch. I don't know
why you do these things.

68
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,840
I guess I just don't like kids.

69
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,080
I keep telling you,
they're a pre-requisite of the job.

70
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,760
I know. A slight problem.

71
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,080
Maybe I could just be
a clown for adults.

72
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,840
- You're fired.
- Do I get to keep the costume?

73
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,720
No. Drop your costume at the desk
on the way out. Goodbye, Fletch.

74
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,480
- Do I get this week's money?
- Goodbye, Fletch.

75
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,080
<i>I'm cryin'blood.</i>

76
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,400
<i>I'm cryin'blood.</i>

77
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,840
<i>I'm cryin' tears from my eyes
that I can't deny.</i>

78
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,720
<i>And I'm fallin'like a comet
from the sky.</i>

79
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,000
<i>I'm cryin'blood.</i>

80
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,640
<i>I'm cryin'blood.</i>

81
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,040
<i>I'm cryin' tears from my eyes
that I can't deny.</i>

82
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,200
<i>And I'm fallin'like a comet
from the broken sky.</i>

83
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,400
<i>Oh, how you.</i>

84
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,640
<i>Oh, how you need me.</i>

85
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,600
<i>Desperately.</i>

86
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,960
<i>Desperately need me.</i>

87
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,360
<i>Wish you could...</i>

88
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,720
I've come up with a plan
for getting her back.

89
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,360
What, like revenge?

90
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,000
No, getting her back, not
"getting her back" getting her back.

91
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,080
Getting her back.
Number one: Take her on holiday.

92
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,520
Stop there.
That's just fucking stupid.

93
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,440
- The two of us, on our own...
- On your own?

94
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,760
Like when you went to Falaraki
and she dumped you and banged that...

95
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,160
...water ski instructor
with highlights and necklace?

96
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,200
She didn't dump me.
She told me she was just... Confused.

97
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,920
Not that confused she couldn't
figure out where to put his cock.

98
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:23,480
- That's my bird you're talking about.
- No. No, it isn't. Not anymore.

99
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,600
Look, you need to get away
from all this shit.

100
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,160
Let us have a wacky adventure,
you and me.

101
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,520
I'm not gonna bum you, but I think
you could use a distraction.

102
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,160
Say what you like, but you cannot
deny I am incredibly distracting.

103
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,480
- Some might say annoying.
- And that...

104
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,200
I don't know.
Where do you suggest we go?

105
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,560
Ibiza.

106
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:53,440
The sun, the sea, the sand,
clubs and fanny.

107
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:58,960
Lots and lots of fanny.
Loads and loads of fanny.

108
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,360
A gargantuan amount of "vajay".

109
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,520
All wanting to shag you, Jimmy McLaren...

110
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,280
...and if there's a few stragglers
who fancy a go on me, then so be it.

111
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,520
I can't. I'm skint.

112
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,240
What? I thought
you had loads saved up.

113
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,440
Yeah... I lent it to Judy to buy a car.

114
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:22,920
Oh, my God! Why don't you just get
"total twat" tattooed on your forehead?

115
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,800
Can't you see what that witch
has done to our lives?

116
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:30,080
Relied on that money for my holiday.
Our holiday, I mean.

117
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,480
- How much have you got?
- Um...

118
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,480
Uh, well...

119
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,160
Tricky, because
I've sort of been sacked.

120
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,120
- You hit another girl?
- It was a boy.

121
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,760
I don't want to talk about it.

122
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:46,400
So what we're essentially saying is that
neither of us can afford to go anywhere.

123
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,800
- Pretty much.
- Brilliant.

124
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,640
Uh, hello. Wasn't expecting you.

125
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,480
- I've finally done it!
- Done what?

126
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:17,480
Get the "champers" on ice.
I'm all yours, honey.

127
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:21,800
- Oh, bloody hell.
- I've left him for good this time...

128
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,040
...so you and me can have fun.

129
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,600
You've done what?

130
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,720
Let's celebrate. Naughty boy!

131
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,240
Who the hell are you?

132
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:40,600
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm his girlfriend.

133
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:46,160
Really? I'm his wife.

134
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,760
Right.

135
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,480
- Dave, get back here!
- In my defence...

136
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,160
I never meant for you to find out.

137
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:10,040
- I got a plan.
- Does it involve girls?

138
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,560
- It's cheap.
- Yeah. Does it involve girls?

139
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,160
Let's... Go... Hiking.

140
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,920
That... is one of the most
depressingly shitty...

141
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,240
...ideas for a holiday
I've ever heard in my life, ever.

142
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,120
- It's a great idea.
- You're a penis!

143
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,880
Wherever it lands on the map,
we go there.

144
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,000
Leave it to the hands of fate.

145
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,360
- What do you say?
- No.

146
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,720
- It'll be brilliant.
- It will be shit.

147
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,600
Let the dart show us the way.

148
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,920
All right, then. Fuck it.

149
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:50,280
I'm only agreeing because
I'm feeling for you right now...

150
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:54,160
...and because
I'm unbelievably shit-faced.

151
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,240
Throw it like you mean it, McLaren.

152
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,880
I never heard of it.
How do you say it? Crag...

153
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,600
Cragwi... Cragwich?

154
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,360
It's spelled A-D-V-N-T-U-R-E, my friend.

155
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,520
Christ, you're a tit!

156
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,320
Get that?

157
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,920
Country air. Nothing like it.

158
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,480
Smells like normal air
with cow shit in it.

159
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,480
Exactly. Nothing like the
pervading stench of faeces...

160
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,640
...to take your mind off your troubles.

161
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,280
Have you brought anything besides beer?

162
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,440
You're expecting a
water bomb fight or something?

163
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,520
<i>- Hello?
- Jimmy, it's me.</i>

164
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,000
- Judy?
- Yes! Look, Jimmy.

165
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,560
I've been thinking, and I realise
I've made a terrible mistake.

166
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,160
I want to come back, Jimmy.
I... Love you.

167
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,000
- What?
- I love you!

168
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,720
<i>Hello?</i>

169
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,720
I can't hear... Hello?

170
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,640
Judy?

171
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,680
I'll drive to meet you.

172
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:46,240
We can talk, the two of us.
We can work everything out.

173
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,640
<i>When I get there,
you can wear my panties.</i>

174
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:03,800
- Why'd you do that?
- We are here to hike.

175
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:07,760
But... I can't fucking believe
you just done that!

176
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,640
OK, maybe I did overreact
a bit, and I'm sorry.

177
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,600
I'll, um, buy you another one. Jim...

178
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,920
Jim!

179
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,400
Hold up a minute.

180
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,160
Can't we take a little rest?
I'm getting a stitch.

181
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,360
We've only been walking
for three minutes.

182
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,440
Yeah, but you're not walking.
You're virtually running.

183
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,280
It's like you're in a mood with me.

184
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,440
- I can't imagine why. Can you?
- You're getting a real attitude.

185
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,600
- Oh, fuck off.
- No, you fuck off.

186
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,160
I've dragged my arse
to some leafy shit-hole...

187
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,840
I can't even pronounce, for you,
and look how ungrateful you're being.

188
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,680
Ungrateful? You stamped on my phone
whilst Judy was trying to make up.

189
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,640
What? Like the last seven times?

190
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,920
You're a mental case holding out
for that serial dumper...

191
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,640
...to have you back for the... Drum roll,
please... Eighth fucking time.

192
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,120
That's why we're here
rather than somewhere...

193
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:17,080
...it might be remotely possible
to engage a solitary woman...

194
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,840
...in so much as a polite conversation.

195
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,840
- There might be girls.
- Will there? Balls.

196
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,920
<i>Woman.</i>

197
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,680
<i>You know you, Woman.</i>

198
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,440
<i>You got to be a Woman.</i>

199
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,600
<i>I've got the feeling of love.</i>

200
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,640
<i>When you're talking to me.</i>

201
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,960
<i>You see right through me.</i>

202
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,480
<i>I've got the feeling of love.</i>

203
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,400
<i>She's a woman, you know what I mean.</i>

204
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,800
<i>You better listen, listen to me.</i>

205
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,760
<i>She's gonna set you free.</i>

206
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,080
<i>Oh, oh, yeah.</i>

207
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:18,200
What are the chances?

208
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,960
Come on, Jim.
They came from there.

209
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,560
- Yeah. So?
- "So"?

210
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,600
Are you some kind of eunuch
or something?

211
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:34,400
Not bad enough that woman's robbed you
of brains, but testicles and all.

212
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,880
I'm sorry.
I'm claiming your testicles back.

213
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,640
No... Not that I literally
want your test...

214
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,080
That's just sick. Look.
They're just the beginning.

215
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,840
These small, rural places
are renowned for breeding...

216
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,280
...the crème de la crème of the
female form. It's the fresh air.

217
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,920
They go a bundle for city boys like
you and me. Impressive we are, mate.

218
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:57,200
I guarantee this place will be
wall to wall with rosy-cheeked...

219
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,080
English country maidens,
like that lot, but even dirtier.

220
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,720
It's like some sort of medieval gay bar.

221
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,880
Don't sweat it.

222
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,600
The womenfolk are all off
braiding their hair...

223
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,600
...in some kind of naked fertility
ceremony or something.

224
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,760
That village green will be full
of heaving tits by sundown.

225
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,800
- These guys look weird.
- Just relax.

226
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,560
They're just blokes, like you and I.

227
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,520
They like a beer,
enjoy a scented candle.

228
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:36,560
They're my kind of people.
I can relate. Stick with me.

229
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,880
Good morrow.

230
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,800
Two flagons of ale, please, sir.

231
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,120
There you go.

232
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,080
Compliments of the house, lads.

233
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,880
Thank you.

234
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:28,560
Keep it together, mate.
Keep it together.

235
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,600
I'm just a bit worried
I'm going to get raped.

236
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,480
So how many more, Tom?
How many more?

237
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,360
Don't you be all high and mighty
with me, vicar.

238
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,640
We have to stop this madness.

239
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,200
- Reckon that's his daughter?
- If it's not, that's one dirty vicar.

240
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,240
We can't let more
innocent people die!

241
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,760
- Then what? Then they'll come for us!
- Oh. Hi.

242
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,800
Don't you see they have us already?
Our women are cursed...

243
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,480
...and we are spineless fools
who let it happen.

244
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:04,080
I know it's hard, vicar, what with
your Rebecca turning 18...

245
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,280
Eighteen? Love it.

246
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:10,840
Together we can stop this.
You are either with me or against me.

247
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,400
What a tosser.

248
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,880
Who is with me?

249
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,560
No, it can't be.

250
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,160
No, that's impossible.

251
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:29,160
- It can't be you. What is your name?
- Hey, this cost 25 quid, mate!

252
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:32,800
- That is enough, Father. Enough!
- Daddy!

253
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,040
Come, child.

254
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:44,880
Does he know you? Have you been
hanging out with vicars?

255
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:48,680
- Never seen him before in my life.
- Sorry about that, lads.

256
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:52,280
Here you go.
No hard feelings, eh?

257
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:56,320
Sorry for the vicar.
He's a strange sort.

258
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,400
If you lads want a bed for the night...

259
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,960
...there be a cottage,
the old Mircalla place...

260
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,960
...not two miles down the road.

261
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,280
Oh, that's great, but how much is it?

262
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,560
- We're a bit light on the old...
- Money.

263
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,120
Oh, it don't cost nothing.
The doors are always open.

264
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:19,800
Any weary traveller
can expect a nice, long rest.

265
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:24,320
You, sir, are a scholar and a gent.

266
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,840
If there's one thing I like more
than free booze, it's a free bed.

267
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,200
Thank you very much.

268
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,840
Might be a bit
of a tight squeeze, though.

269
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,200
I sent some beautiful young girls
down there not too long ago.

270
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,040
<i>Take off your clothes
Come on, take 'em off.</i>

271
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,760
<i>I like you so much better
when you're naked.</i>

272
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,440
<i>I like me so much better
when you're naked.</i>

273
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,640
<i>I like you so much better
when you're naked.</i>

274
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:06,760
<i>I like you so much...</i>

275
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,360
What's wrong with it?

276
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:12,200
Come on, come on.
Don't break down on us now. Come on!

277
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,240
Come on! What?

278
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,040
- Come on!
- That'll really help, Lotte.

279
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,720
<i>- We're screwed.
- Ja.</i>

280
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:35,960
Great. We're in the middle of nowhere,
miles from anywhere.

281
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,160
Are you sure you put petrol in?

282
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,480
- Anke, for the fifth time, yes.
- Just checking.

283
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,360
Well, let us walk to the cottage.
We must be close.

284
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,160
The landlord said
it was only a few miles.

285
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,960
<i>- Ja.
- We're closer to the inn.</i>

286
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,760
We should go get help.

287
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,720
<i>Ja. Ja.</i>

288
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,760
I'm only going back there with knives.
Those men were freaky.

289
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:04,160
<i>- I think we should stay with the van.
- Ja.</i>

290
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,640
Oh...

291
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,240
Do you hear that?

292
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,880
What is it?

293
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,160
There's something out there.

294
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,600
<i>- Stop scaring us, Lotte.
- Ja.</i>

295
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,520
Listen, listen!

296
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,200
It's coming from the roof!

297
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,480
- It is probably just a branch.
- A branch?

298
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,640
<i>Ja.</i>

299
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,960
I told you!

300
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,640
- Evening, ladies.
- Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you.

301
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,640
Excuse us.
Our van just broke down...

302
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,440
- And we were a little bit spooked.
- Seems OK now.

303
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,760
Anyhow, hi, I'm Lotte.

304
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,520
This is Anke, Heidi and Trudi.

305
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:21,320
Hello, Lotte, Andy, Eric. Hello, girls.

306
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,320
<i>- Beer?
- Oh,ja!</i>

307
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,640
<i>Ja, ja, ja!</i>

308
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,280
You're my type of girl.

309
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,000
The name's Fletch.

310
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,920
- What's your name?
- That's my man, Jimmy.

311
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,600
He's had his heart broken. It's tragic.

312
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,520
- Oh!
- It's just tragic. Really is.

313
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,680
- Hello, Jimmy.
- All right.

314
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:52,680
So, what are four lovely ladies like
you doing here on a night like this?

315
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,160
We're on our way
to the Mircalla cottage.

316
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,720
There's an uncanny stroke of luck!

317
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,280
These girls are all going to the exact
same cottage that we are.

318
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,880
- Yes! Yes!
- Yes! Yes!

319
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,040
Great.

320
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,400
- Do you want to ride with us?
- Thanks. That's very nice of you.

321
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,320
- Oh, yeah!
- Take a seat.

322
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,320
When in Rome.

323
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,960
- Be careful. You know what happens.
- Relax. It's fine.

324
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,960
OK, let's go.

325
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,920
A couple of young fellows
were in here not an hour ago.

326
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,640
Directed them towards the cottage
not a couple of miles down the road.

327
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,160
What? Just carry on down the road?

328
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:57,000
There you go, miss. Carry straight
on down, and you can't fail to see it.

329
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,160
Now, she was a pretty one.

330
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,640
They always are, Sidney.

331
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:08,800
Sirens. Cold, bewitching demons,
every last one of them.

332
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,200
Pint, Jack?

333
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:44,680
- Wow. This place is amazing!
- Oh, I love it!

334
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,520
- Oh, cool!
- They got beers!

335
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,040
Can we actually move here?

336
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,640
- Yes!
- Yes, let's move in!

337
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,440
<i>Let's party!</i>

338
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,640
- We need Schnapps!
- Rack 'em up! Rack 'em up!

339
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,400
All right! Yes!

340
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:15,560
J man, bottoms up!

341
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,200
- Bottoms up!
- Cocks in.

342
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:22,400
- Oh, yummy!
- Let's dance!

343
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,240
Oh!

344
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,520
<i>Feelin'hot, hot, hot.</i>

345
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,720
<i>Feelin'hot, hot, hot.</i>

346
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,880
This might be the best night
of my entire fucking life!

347
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,640
Room for the Fletchmeister? Yes? Yes?

348
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,480
<i>Let me rum bum bum bum.</i>

349
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,160
<i>Let me rum bum bum bum.</i>

350
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,160
I love hiking!

351
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:10,000
<i>Olé, olé, olé, olé.</i>

352
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:13,320
<i>Olé, olé, olé, olé.</i>

353
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,720
<i>Let me rum bum bum bum...</i>

354
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,760
<i>- Let me rum bum bum bum.
- Take your clothes off!</i>

355
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:23,240
<i>- Take your clothes off!
- Feelin'hot, hot, hot.</i>

356
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,360
<i>Feelin'hot, hot, hot.</i>

357
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,880
Do you know of Carmilla?

358
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:36,880
- Uh, no. Is that who it is?
- Yes.

359
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:40,360
- Carmilla. She's why we're all here.
- Eh?

360
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:44,920
We're students of folklore and ancient
superstition. We're on a field trip.

361
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:48,520
This village is home to the legend
of Carmilla, the vampire queen.

362
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,000
- Vampire queen?
- According to legend...

363
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:54,160
...she's much, much more than
just your average vampire queen.

364
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,200
Some say she's 2,000 years old.

365
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,800
<i>You believe in that
Dungeons & Dragons rubbish?</i>

366
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,720
Where I grew up,
we're very superstitious.

367
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,720
Cragwich is particularly
fascinating to me.

368
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,440
The book of folklore tells
the story of this village...

369
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,880
...and what Carmilla did to it
and its daughters.

370
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:13,040
Even the bravest man shrinks in fear,
and the bravest woman...

371
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,120
quivers with desire
at the mere mention of her name.

372
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,600
Carmilla, the vampire queen.

373
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,440
<i>Saturday, Saturday.</i>

374
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,680
<i>- Hey! Jimmy Peon!
- Saturday night.</i>

375
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:32,080
Come on. Get a beer. Get involved.

376
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,120
It is your turn to go
with the larger one.

377
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,840
<i>Saturday night.
Saturday night.</i>

378
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,240
- Too many beers. I need a piss.
- The bog's outside.

379
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,800
What? It's... It's dark out there.

380
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,400
Heidi, are you afraid
Carmilla will get you?

381
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:50,560
- Anke, don't be mean.
- OK, OK, I'm sorry.

382
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,720
- Don't worry. I will go with her.
- Stop it!

383
00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:00,080
<i>- Saturday night.
- Watch this. Here come the beers.</i>

384
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,480
<i>- Here come the beers. Ja?
- Ooh,ja!</i>

385
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,960
He's a weird guy, Fletch, eh?

386
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,240
She's pretending to bum me.

387
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,960
Oh, his heart's in the right place.

388
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,320
It's just a shame
his brain's in his dick.

389
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:26,720
- Think his ying yang is big?
- Ying yang?

390
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:42,880
<i>I like you so much better
when you're naked.</i>

391
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:47,200
<i>I like you so much
better when you're naked.</i>

392
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,560
All right. Which one do you want, then?

393
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,920
Haven't thought about it.

394
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,360
Oh! You are such a fucking ponce, James.

395
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,800
Which one do you fancy?
Which one do you like the most?

396
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,080
- Just answer the question.
- All right, then. Lotte.

397
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,680
- She seems really nice and friendly.
- Mm-hmm.

398
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:19,840
And it's like
she's got this pure spirit.

399
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,720
She's just really sweet.
She's got the prettiest eyes.

400
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,800
It's like looking into bottomless pools.

401
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,040
- And you?
- Trudi.

402
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,640
Massive tits, never speaks.

403
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,800
Yeah, Trudi, you stink.

404
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,760
<i>Ja. Ja.</i>

405
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,880
<i>Oh,ja.</i>

406
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,080
Hurry up!

407
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,600
Anke.

408
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:11,320
Anke?

409
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:15,240
- Anke, stop it. It isn't funny.
- Heidi.

410
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,680
Fuck!

411
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:24,080
Anke, answer me now. It's not funny.

412
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,000
Anke!

413
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,800
Anke?

414
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,680
Anke? Anke!

415
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,440
Why are they taking so long?

416
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,920
She's probably just having
a massive shit.

417
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,400
Trudi.

418
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,760
Trudi.

419
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:26,160
Trudi.

420
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:34,000
Trudi.

421
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,960
Quickly!

422
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,600
Trudi! We've got to get in there!

423
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,920
OK. Stand back.

424
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,880
Christ. That thing is rock-solid.

425
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,800
- I must have weakened it.
- Yeah, right.

426
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,960
- Look.
- Blood.

427
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,920
Come.

428
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,720
What was that?

429
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,720
I don't know, but let's go find out.

430
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,600
- Is she serious?
- We have to do something, don't we?

431
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:08,360
This is all getting a bit weird: Women
missing, towels covered in blood.

432
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:11,520
- It's more of a light spotting.
- Oh, that's all right, then.

433
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,120
We heard her in here,
and now she's nowhere.

434
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:17,760
- That is very fucking weird.
- Agreed, but we have to find Trudi.

435
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,200
- You like Trudi, don't you?
- Not that much.

436
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,640
That's just weak, man.

437
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,400
For Christ's sake.

438
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,920
Oh, God!

439
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:47,000
For God's sake!

440
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,640
I only got it seen to last week.

441
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,960
Oh, my... Oh, come on!

442
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:00,840
Shit!

443
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,320
<i>Hi. You're through to Jimmy.
Please leave a message.</i>

444
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:17,360
You are so dead, Jimmy!

445
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,200
Judy.

446
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:24,520
Judy. Judy.

447
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:27,000
Anke!

448
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:31,640
Heidi? Trudi?

449
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,120
- Anything?
- No.

450
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,720
Ah, well. Looks like she's gone.

451
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,560
Head back inside, eh? Cup of tea?

452
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:50,000
- Told you there was no one out here.
- Trudi?

453
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,920
Probably just gone for a walk
or... Something.

454
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,400
Let's head inside.
I've still got some beers.

455
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:58,280
Oh, shit!

456
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,320
Lotte.

457
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,720
- It's over there.
- I heard it too.

458
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:08,080
Look. I know something really wrong
is happening here...

459
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,720
...but is there any chance
we can just ignore it?

460
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,000
Fletch! Come on!

461
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,600
It's impossible. It cannot be. Vampires.

462
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,320
- Vampires?
- Vampires?

463
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,760
Lesbian vampires.

464
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:17,440
Nice one.

465
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,720
Fucking hell, she's strong.

466
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,680
Jimmy!

467
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:37,040
- Shit.
- Jimmy!

468
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:51,000
She's not so strong now.

469
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,280
Ah! Rank!

470
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:26,720
Is that it?

471
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,440
No explosion or...

472
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:33,160
...turning into burning ash or...
Nothing, no?

473
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,240
Frankly, I'm a bit disappointed.

474
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:40,400
I'm just glad she's dead.
I can hold out for fireworks.

475
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,640
The legends... They're true.

476
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,040
This is madness.

477
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,040
- What's become of my friends?
- Lotte.

478
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,280
Oh, crap.

479
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:54,080
- Join us.
- Join us.

480
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,520
<i>Ja.</i>

481
00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:00,400
I think they want you to say something.

482
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,600
Never.

483
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,280
Don't think they wanted you to say that.

484
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,520
Fuck this! Run, you bellends!

485
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,320
Come on, you silly fuckers!

486
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:24,640
Now you will join us.

487
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,600
Hmm.

488
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:31,600
Get in.

489
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,600
Oh, my God! Did you see that?

490
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:41,240
That might be the coolest thing
I've done in my entire fucking life.

491
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,040
I've always been good at cricket.
Maybe it's my guns.

492
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,680
- Fletch, please shut up.
- Sorry, I'm just nervous.

493
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:49,080
They'd have eaten us alive.
This is fucked up!

494
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:51,680
Where did they go?

495
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:56,640
Before sunrise,
you will all belong to us.

496
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,480
Shit, shit, shit, shit.
What are we going to do?

497
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:05,040
- We're going to die horribly.
- For Christ sake. You're not helping.

498
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,240
- Calm down. Have a beer.
- We need to get out of here!

499
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,680
- Come up with a plan then, Einstein.
- Hold on. The van.

500
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,800
The van. Good plan. Great plan.

501
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,720
Genius.

502
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,960
I don't even want to know.

503
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:20,520
What are we going to do now?

504
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,320
Stakes. Lots of sharp stakes.

505
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:30,080
Arm ourselves with anything we can
plunge through their hearts.

506
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,880
Again, great idea. Like it.

507
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:36,080
Plunging sharp objects. Hell-whore
hearts. Let's fucking have it.

508
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,080
<i>Saturday night, I feel...</i>

509
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,960
- Jimmy!
- Judy?

510
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:54,280
What? Don't open
the fucking door! Jesus!

511
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,520
- Judy, get in, quick.
- Oh, my God!

512
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:01,240
- What the hell is going on?
- What are you doing here?

513
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:04,600
- Something was chasing me.
- Vampires.

514
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:08,680
- What?
- Yep. Lesbian vampires.

515
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:11,160
- How ridiculous.
- No.

516
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:14,320
Just another of God's cruel tricks
to get on my tits.

517
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,040
Even dead women would sooner sleep
with each other than get with me.

518
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:21,560
- But eating me alive? Oh, that's fine.
- Lesbian vampires?

519
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:25,320
Next time he'll have me bummed
by a big gay werewolf, I swear.

520
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,960
Come on. We need to lie down.

521
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:36,040
- Who's that?
- Oh, it's Jimmy's ex.

522
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,840
She keeps breaking up with him,
getting him back...

523
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,600
...breaking up with him,
getting him back, you know?

524
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:47,280
- I hate her.
- Me too.

525
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:50,360
Man, this pisses me off.

526
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:53,280
I've been saving myself
for the right man...

527
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,760
...someone I can really have feelings for.

528
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:59,400
- I finally meet him, and...
- What, you like Jimmy?

529
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,960
Yes, I do.
But between her and the vampires...

530
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,600
I'll probably die a virgin tonight.

531
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,720
You're a virgin?

532
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:16,760
Um, yeah.

533
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,720
Oh, for God's sake, girl.
Cover yourself up.

534
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,000
Daddy, I'm not a child any more.

535
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:44,040
- Don't try me, girl.
- Oh!

536
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,560
Jimmy, I know you have
every right to hate me...

537
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,840
...but I just want you to know...

538
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,080
...that I'm so happy
you let me through the door.

539
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,720
Well, I don't hate you.
Well, not completely.

540
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,880
I just don't know what
I keep doing you don't like.

541
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:22,400
It's not you, Jimmy. It's me.

542
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,280
I'm glad you realise that,
because if this is gonna work...

543
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:29,920
- You're gonna have to change.
- Oh, I've changed.

544
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,200
But how... How do I know that?

545
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:35,880
How can I trust you? You're gonna
have to show me you're different.

546
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,640
Oh, I'm different.

547
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:47,680
Give me one... Last... Kiss.

548
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,240
Huh?

549
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:56,760
Probably best you remember her
the way she was, mate.

550
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:00,680
A complete fucking bitch. Aah.

551
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,840
Mate, thanks for saving my life.

552
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,840
Hey, you know me, fella.

553
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:15,160
I got your back.
Always have, always will.

554
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,360
- Right, got 'em.
- What are you doing?

555
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:21,640
- What do you think?
- What, Lotte was gonna...

556
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:24,360
You know what they say
about extreme situations.

557
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:28,560
And this, as I keep pointing out, my
friend, is an extreme fucking situation.

558
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:31,760
- Bit seedy, isn't it?
- She's worried she'll die a virgin...

559
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,920
...and frankly, I'm willing to take
any opportunity I can get.

560
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:37,960
Emotional vulnerability, fear of
imminent death, vampire attacks.

561
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:41,120
Screw it. I don't give a shit. Hi.

562
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,920
How are you doing?

563
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:48,480
- What happened?
- Oh, God. Um...

564
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:52,640
As I suspected...

565
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:56,800
- Judy was a vampire.
- We killed her.

566
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,800
Fantastic.

567
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:13,440
- Um, I'm going for a piss.
- What, outside?

568
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,880
Do I look like a twat?

569
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:33,960
Oh, God! Oh, God!
Oh, God! Oh, gosh!

570
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:35,720
Oh, God! Oh, God!

571
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:38,160
Why aren't they coming in?
Judy walked in.

572
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:41,320
No, they have to be invited in.
You invited Judy in.

573
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,520
Oh.

574
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:49,960
So all we have to do
is sit tight till morning.

575
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:52,240
I mean, It's not like I'm gonna say...

576
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:56,080
"Hey, lesbian vampires,
come into my cottage", is it? Oh, shit!

577
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:05,160
Under full-on lesbian vampire attack?

578
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:08,040
Still got it, fella.

579
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:12,240
Look, I was being ironic.

580
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,640
Guys?

581
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,400
McLaren.

582
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:28,240
- She knows my name.
- That's not a good sign.

583
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:33,000
She is pure.

584
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:39,080
Fletch!

585
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:48,240
When in Rome...

586
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:58,520
- Get away from him.
- Fuck off!

587
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:26,240
- Nice.
- Get her into the shower.

588
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:29,040
Quick! Quick!

589
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,800
Quick! Turn it on!

590
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:37,960
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be Thy name.

591
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:40,680
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done on earth...

592
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:44,760
Give us this day... Push her back!
She must stay underwater.

593
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:47,520
Push her back!
Push her back under.

594
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:51,960
- Oh, God!
- Keep her under! Don't let her go!

595
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:56,080
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil...

596
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,840
...as we forgive those
who trespass against us...

597
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,560
- Fuck off!
- Keep going.

598
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:05,720
Fucking hell!

599
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:08,240
For Thine is the kingdom.
Jesus compels you!

600
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:11,400
Oh, God, I love Jesus!
I love you, Jesus.

601
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:16,000
- And the glory forever.
- All things bright and beautiful!

602
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,360
Forever and ever.

603
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:23,920
Amen.

604
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:27,360
What the fuck?

605
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:30,520
We need to go quickly.
Your friends have already been taken.

606
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:33,080
- Ah, shite.
- There's no time to waste. Let's go!

607
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:36,000
Hang on. How did you know
all this was happening?

608
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:38,560
You and your friends
were sent as sacrifices.

609
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:42,640
It's an age-old deal,
where the villagers supply fresh blood.

610
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:45,440
In return, they get to keep
their cowardly hides.

611
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:49,400
So we were just a light buffet
for a bunch of hot dykes?

612
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:53,720
To my shame, yes. Your friend's
arrival in our hamlet is no coincidence.

613
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:57,120
It's divine intervention
fulfilling a primordial prophecy.

614
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:00,280
- Balls!
- Does he bear a birthmark?

615
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:02,840
- Five red scratches around here?
- Yeah.

616
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,880
His bloodline is the key
to the resurrection...

617
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:10,480
...of the purest evil known to mankind:
Carmilla, the vampire queen.

618
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,360
Eh?

619
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:15,000
Paradoxically, the only thing
that can lift this village...

620
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:17,680
...from a centuries-old curse
that turns every woman...

621
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:20,760
...on her 18th birthday into a vampire.

622
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:24,880
My daughter, Rebecca,
becomes 18 within hours.

623
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:28,040
Right. Look,
I know you mean well. I really do.

624
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:30,720
And I love the vibe.
You look amazing. But...

625
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:35,800
I've seen weird shit, and even under
these circumstances this is a stretch.

626
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:38,920
Jimmy's not the Messiah.
He can barely wipe his own arse.

627
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:42,240
I understand your confusion.
Let's be on our way.

628
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,960
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, Daddy-o. Go where?

629
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:48,360
- Back to the village. No time to waste.
- Fuck that noise.

630
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:50,760
- I'm sorry?
- I'm not going back out there.

631
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:54,520
I've nearly been eaten three times
by the hottest women I've ever met.

632
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:56,360
Starting to become a bind.

633
00:48:56,520 --> 00:49:00,440
But it's not too late to save your
friends, this village, the entire world!

634
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:03,000
Yeah, well, you know,
best of luck with it.

635
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:07,040
- I hope you get on all right.
- Are you fucking with me?

636
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:10,400
- Are you allowed to swear?
- Shut up.

637
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:14,280
You telling me you'd let eternal
darkness sweep over this entire planet...

638
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:17,240
...and leave your friends to die?
Your friends?

639
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:20,680
Well, I only really know Jimmy.
I just met the girl tonight. So...

640
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:24,720
OK. Stay here and die.

641
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:30,960
Oh...

642
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:36,440
What's with all the scratches?

643
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:38,680
The cruciform.
It drives the beasts away.

644
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:43,520
- It looks shit.
- Just get in.

645
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:48,240
OK, scratch master.
Where the fuck are we going?

646
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,600
The tomb of your friend's
great ancestor.

647
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,880
Fletch!

648
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:34,200
Sisters...

649
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:39,360
...a moment that has infested
our dreams and our desires...

650
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:42,720
...for what seems like an eternity...

651
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:46,240
...is finally upon us.

652
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:57,640
For this night...

653
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:02,360
...the last of the
McLaren clan shall fall...

654
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:06,960
...and our queen shall rise again.

655
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:10,480
- Carmilla?
- The vampire queen?

656
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:14,720
Sorry. Carry on.

657
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:19,920
So his blood mixed with
my virgin blood brings her back?

658
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:22,520
You know a lot, pretty one.

659
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:25,920
I've heard of Carmilla,
but never have I heard of you.

660
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:29,200
Obviously you're not evil enough
to even make the history books.

661
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,640
Well...

662
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:42,280
...soon she will know of you.

663
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:49,200
And with her resurrection,
this land will be ensnared forever...

664
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:52,880
...in the dawn of the red moon.

665
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:02,840
McLaren, these are your
final moments on earth.

666
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,240
Oh. Mmm.

667
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:17,440
The final resting place
of Baron Wolfgang McLaren III.

668
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:21,240
Jimmy's the reason
I ended up in this shit-hole?

669
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:23,480
He is our salvation and our only hope.

670
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:27,200
The prophesy foretold of when the last
of the McLaren clan would return.

671
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:30,480
With his blood and that of a virgin,
Carmilla shall rise again.

672
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:32,760
Concealed within this tomb is the weapon...

673
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:35,600
...that can slay the beast forever:
The sword of Daeldo.

674
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:39,160
- And what's that, then?
- Daeldo, the god of lust...

675
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:42,600
...said to be Carmilla's arch demonic foe
in the underworld of Hades.

676
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:44,480
A hideous multi-tentacled beast.

677
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:47,360
The only being brave enough
to have tried to penetrate...

678
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:50,400
Carmilla's vilest depths,
and paid for it with his life.

679
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:52,960
Let me get this straight.
Your plan is...

680
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:57,000
...wait for this bitch to be resurrected,
stake her with the sword of whatever...

681
00:52:57,160 --> 00:53:00,360
...thus rescuing my mate, curing
your daughter, ending the curse...

682
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:03,360
- And saving the planet.
- Exactly. So, are you with me?

683
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:06,280
Not really. I ain't got much
fucking choice, have I?

684
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:10,960
You do this.
I need to check on my Rebecca.

685
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:13,160
What? Now I've got to unearth a corpse?

686
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:16,920
- Concealed within this tomb is...
- Yeah, yeah. Save me the monologues.

687
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:24,080
This is officially
the worst holiday ever.

688
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:49,840
- So there's a red moon, right?
- Forget about the red moon.

689
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,120
She said the last McLaren will fall.

690
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:55,200
Yeah, I kind of missed that bit.

691
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:58,080
Oh. Well...

692
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:01,720
- That'll be me, then. Oh, bollocks.
- Shut up. I'm thinking.

693
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:04,640
What can you be thinking about
at a time like this?

694
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:07,120
- How we are going to escape.
- Fantastic. Any ideas?

695
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,640
- No, have you?
- Not a fucking sausage.

696
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:11,240
Come on, think!

697
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:14,920
I'm too busy shitting myself
to come up with a daring escape plan.

698
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:31,120
- You're cute.
- What?

699
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:33,200
It's our first argument.

700
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:42,160
Vic, we're doomed.
That ain't opening.

701
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:44,280
Move.

702
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:52,040
In my defence,
I only tried that side, so...

703
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:06,880
- You go down there, my boy.
- Excuse me?

704
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:11,200
- There's no time to waste. Hurry up.
- Well, you go down, then.

705
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:18,400
Oh, my... Unbelievable.
It's not my daughter.

706
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:25,120
- Can you see the sword?
- Give me a minute, please.

707
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:29,400
It's my first time
in a tomb... Grave... Stone.

708
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:39,720
What? What is it?

709
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:42,680
It's nothing.

710
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:51,480
What's so funny in there?

711
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:57,760
It's got a big metal cock for a handle.

712
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:01,560
Grow up! The handle draws on
the power of the demon Daeldo...

713
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:05,520
...rendering this blade alone capable
of destroying her once and for all.

714
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:10,960
- What? How?
- Itjust does, OK?

715
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,720
We're gonna go there,
and we're gonna to die, right?

716
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:18,160
All because you insist some sword...

717
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:21,000
...with a metal cock on the end,
can save the world?

718
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:23,800
- You're a disgrace.
- At least I can see the funny side.

719
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:28,280
Let's get on with the job. I'll load up
on weapons. You cover the baron up.

720
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:35,280
Will you just admit
it does look like a cock?

721
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:40,760
Jimmy, can I tell you something?

722
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:43,880
- Have you come up with a plan?
- No, I'm still thinking.

723
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:46,320
I think we're running out of time.

724
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:51,120
I just wanted to say that had we met
under different circumstances...

725
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:53,440
I would've liked to have gotten
to know you.

726
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:55,280
- Really?
- Yes.

727
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:58,960
In fact, even though we've just spent
a few hours together...

728
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:01,320
I feel like I've known you forever.

729
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:07,320
- Really?
- Yes.

730
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:10,360
I thought you might have
picked up on my signals.

731
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:13,880
Signals? What signals?
What did I miss?

732
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:17,280
Jimmy, I love you.

733
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:26,000
- Well, that's just fucking great.
- I didn't mean to upset you.

734
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:30,160
- On the brink of death, you say that?
- I can't die without letting you know...

735
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:33,240
...you're the first man I could
share myself with completely.

736
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:36,400
- Oh, for Christ's sake.
- I would've given you everything:

737
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:39,360
My mind, soul and body.

738
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:43,200
- And body. Hmm.
- And now that'll never be.

739
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:53,000
- It is time.
- Oh, God!

740
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:59,760
- That's my penis.
- Get off him, you bitch! He's mine!

741
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:11,680
Wow.

742
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:21,280
What? What did you just say?

743
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:24,440
You called me a what?
I'm a fat piece of what?

744
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:35,520
No one messes with the Fletchmeister
and his cock sword.

745
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:42,520
Oh, hello.
Um, I wasn't doing, um...

746
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:46,360
<i>Star Wars is not, uh...
Aah! Chewie. I wasn't...</i>

747
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:49,560
What are you doing out?
You probably shouldn't be out here.

748
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:52,400
I know.

749
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:56,640
- So, it's your birthday?
- Today.

750
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:59,040
It's just gone midnight.

751
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:03,960
All... Grown... Up.

752
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:09,200
- So you're 18?
- Uh-huh.

753
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,960
- But Daddy wouldn't approve anyway.
- Oh.

754
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:22,720
Daddy!

755
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:42,560
Fletch!

756
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:50,760
- Ready?
- Yep.

757
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:56,280
We have little time.
My Rebecca will soon be taken.

758
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:58,120
Yep.

759
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:21,400
You have his eyes.

760
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:24,280
I used to love those eyes.

761
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:27,360
Until I learned how pathetic men are.

762
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:38,600
Mmm! Exquisite.

763
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:43,840
I will bleed you slowly and
let Carmilla feed upon your flesh...

764
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,520
...while it is still warm in your veins.

765
01:00:57,560 --> 01:01:02,920
<i>Amazing grace.</i>

766
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:07,760
Look, the moon bleeds.
The resurrection has begun.

767
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:10,520
Here. Holy water.

768
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:12,960
It's like a fucking
hand grenade of acid.

769
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:14,760
- You said "fucking" again.
- So?

770
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:16,360
- It's weird.
- Get over it.

771
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:19,400
There's no need to panic, my friend.
Just stay close to me.

772
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:22,320
I'm well-versed in the knowledge
of killing vampires.

773
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:27,720
Yeah, so is everyone. Stakes, garlic,
beheading, holy water, sunlight...

774
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:30,200
There's not a fucker alive
who doesn't know that.

775
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:32,080
- Really?
- Yeah.

776
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:35,440
It's in books, films, telly.
It's pretty common knowledge.

777
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:44,320
Were you expecting many
sexual encounters, my friend?

778
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:48,240
Water bomb fight.

779
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:51,960
So where's this resurrection
likely to be happening?

780
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:55,520
In there. The crypt of Carmilla.

781
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:58,160
I knew you were gonna say that.

782
01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:00,760
Never going to be somewhere
un-scary-sounding...

783
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:02,760
...like the garden or scullery?

784
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:04,600
- "Scullery" is quite scary.
- Eh?

785
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:06,840
"Scullery" has got
the word "skull" in it.

786
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:10,280
As opposed to the crypt, which has
got corpses in it. Well observed.

787
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:15,400
Remember this: They can die fast
or they can die slow...

788
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:16,920
...but they have to die.

789
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:20,920
- Can't we do this in the morning?
- It may be too late for your friends.

790
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:24,160
- It will be too late for Rebecca.
- No, I'm good.

791
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:25,960
Well, this is it.

792
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:30,200
Good luck, Fletch.
Let's try to come back alive.

793
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:32,120
Vic...

794
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:36,400
If I don't make it out of this...

795
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:39,320
...there's one thing I want you to know:

796
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:41,720
I blame you entirely.

797
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:40,920
So this is how your bloodline ends:

798
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:43,120
Crying like a baby.

799
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:46,400
Begging for your life.

800
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:49,400
- Please...
- Jimmy, pull yourself together.

801
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:52,280
- Don't give her the satisfaction.
- No.

802
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:56,000
You'll give me my satisfaction.

803
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:59,000
Lotte, just so you know,
before she turns you...

804
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:01,600
I found you really attractive,
pre-vampirism.

805
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:04,360
You did?

806
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:13,000
- We have an escape plan.
- What?

807
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:14,440
Fletch will save us.

808
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:17,280
Fletch? He's fucking useless.
We're dead meat.

809
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:20,680
- Hey! You cheeky prick.
- Fletch!

810
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:22,840
Although, to be fair...

811
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,960
...if I could've avoided being here,
I would've.

812
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:35,400
Oh, damn.

813
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:38,640
I told you he was fucking useless.

814
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:42,760
- Damn, damn!
- You ever fired that thing before?

815
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:45,560
- First time.
- Watch and weep. So!

816
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:50,160
You clam-lappers fancy
a piece of me then, do you?

817
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:54,320
- Come on, then.
- Kill them.

818
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:58,240
Oh, fuck!

819
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:17,880
Oh, wait up. Fuck this.

820
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:21,000
Your friend's blood
has already been drawn.

821
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:23,920
- The resurrection has begun.
- We gotta get out of here.

822
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:26,560
We can't. Darkness is upon us.
Your friends, Rebecca...

823
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:28,800
I reckon I can
probably live with that.

824
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:30,720
...and the entire fucking world!

825
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:34,200
You know how to put a guilt trip on,
don't you, you fucker?

826
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:39,680
Right. Let's do this.

827
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:48,880
- It'll be OK.
- How can this be OK?

828
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:51,160
All I wanted to do was enjoy life.

829
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:53,680
Hike, get some fresh air, a few pints.

830
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:56,200
But no. Nothing's as simple
as that, is it?

831
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:58,800
And now we're gonna end up dead.

832
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:02,440
Well, I'm gonna end up dead.
You'll be a lesbian.

833
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:05,000
And I've not even made love to a man.

834
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:06,720
Oh!

835
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:16,320
The crypt is through here.

836
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:20,440
<i>- Fletch!
- Spiritus Sancti.</i>

837
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:24,280
Fletch!

838
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:28,800
<i>- Spiritus sancti.
- Hurry up!</i>

839
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:31,840
- Jimmy?
- Back, you spawn of Satan.

840
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:35,280
- Fletch?
- How you been?

841
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:37,560
Up and down.

842
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:44,000
- There's only one solution now.
- The big cock sword.

843
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:45,480
- What?
- Long story.

844
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:50,240
- Hand me the sword of Daeldo.
- Haven't you got it?

845
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:51,600
I thought you had it.

846
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:53,840
You're going on about
how important it is.

847
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,760
All we've got to do is wait
for this bitch to rise, stab her...

848
01:06:56,920 --> 01:06:59,440
- And you forgot the sword?
- Get it. I'll keep 'em off.

849
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:01,800
- Tell Rebecca I love her.
- About Rebecca...

850
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:03,480
- Run, you fool!
- All right!

851
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:34,880
Jesus!

852
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:51,920
- Whores of fucking Hades.
- Annihilate him.

853
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:59,880
Prepare for fucking death!

854
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:12,440
Come on, you silly fuckers!

855
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:17,040
- Lotte!
- It's playtime, darling.

856
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:27,560
Mmm! You are a feisty one.

857
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:32,240
I like it. Aah!

858
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:43,760
- It won't budge.
- I have to help her.

859
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:45,920
It's not gonna work.

860
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:52,520
- What is it with you and doors?
- Let's ram it.

861
01:09:56,920 --> 01:09:59,560
Mmm! You taste divine.

862
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:05,360
- Keys.
- Vicar's got them.

863
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:07,360
- What?
- Know how to hotwire a hearse?

864
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:09,440
- Yeah, no worries.
- Brilliant. Let's go.

865
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:11,560
- Of course I don't, you idiot.
- Shit.

866
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:23,920
First I'm going to torture you,
then I'm going to turn you.

867
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:26,880
- You'll be my plaything.
- Never!

868
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:28,440
That's it, then.

869
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:31,040
The problem with you, James,
you're a pessimist.

870
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:34,960
You might want to grab weapons.
We could be in for a ruck.

871
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:45,360
Come on!

872
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:56,600
- That sword's got a cock for a handle.
- It's funny, isn't it?

873
01:10:56,760 --> 01:10:59,640
It's the only thing that'll
destroy that psycho bitch.

874
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:01,640
It's very powerful and very ancient.

875
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:04,600
- Sort of gay.
- So get your own fucking sword.

876
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:29,720
I knew you would not resist me forever.

877
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:51,280
Sorry, you're not my type.

878
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:14,880
- Whoo-hoo!
- Lotte.

879
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:56,160
- Bollocks.
- Fletch.

880
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:21,120
Oh, my God!

881
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:55,120
McLaren.

882
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:06,760
- Jimmy!
- Throw it like you mean it!

883
01:14:27,240 --> 01:14:31,120
Un-fucking-believable!

884
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:25,560
Is somebody taking the piss?

885
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:29,400
The sword of Daeldo
is a mighty weapon indeed.

886
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:32,320
Looks like the vic was right.

887
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:35,760
Everyone seems to know what's
going on bar me. Whatjust happened?

888
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:38,920
It's all cock swords and scary stuff
and history and that.

889
01:15:39,080 --> 01:15:41,040
- I'll tell you later.
- Tell me now.

890
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:42,520
- I will.
- When?

891
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:44,520
Mate, do you want to calm down?

892
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:47,800
I've had a bit of a busy night.
I'll tell you in a minute.

893
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:50,560
- Whoa.
- No, look. Sunlight.

894
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:54,120
The curse has lifted.

895
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:58,000
- So they're not vampires anymore?
- No.

896
01:15:58,160 --> 01:16:01,320
Cool. Are they still lesbians?

897
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:04,840
For fuck's sake.

898
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:09,040
Uh...

899
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:19,600
Unbelievable.
Save the day, not even a kiss.

900
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:22,160
Do you know what? Actually, forget it.

901
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:24,160
Forget it. Forget it. Let it go.

902
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:26,920
Let it go, Fletch.
You're the bigger man.

903
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:37,240
Whoa! That's some mighty fine
hotwiring skills you got there, lady.

904
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:39,760
Thanks. Right. Now what?

905
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:42,400
Don't know. Go home?

906
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:46,400
Go home? They've taken my friends,
they very nearly took our lives...

907
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:49,360
...and we never even dreamed
they existed before tonight.

908
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:52,680
How can we just go home to our beds?

909
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:54,960
- What's she talking about?
- Uh...

910
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:56,600
This village is free...

911
01:16:56,760 --> 01:17:00,320
...but more creatures like Carmilla lurk
in the dark corners of the world.

912
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:02,600
No one would believe us if we tell.

913
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:05,160
We are the only people
who know the truth.

914
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:07,920
We must go out there
and fight this menace.

915
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:11,920
Are you suggesting we become
lesbian vampire killers?

916
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:14,880
<i>If that's what it takes,ja.</i>

917
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:21,520
Well, I ain't got anything else on
in particular at the moment, so I'm in.

918
