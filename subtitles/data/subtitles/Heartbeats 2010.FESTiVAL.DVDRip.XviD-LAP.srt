1
00:00:17,182 --> 00:00:20,718
The only truth
is love beyond reason.

2
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:26,551
We write about 20, 25 texts a day.

3
00:00:28,783 --> 00:00:32,119
I'd go, c'mon, let's hitchhike
to Miami Beach.

4
00:00:32,283 --> 00:00:33,684
He'd anmer now!

5
00:00:33,916 --> 00:00:34,983
ln 1 sec he's there.

6
00:00:35,549 --> 00:00:36,783
But of course

7
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:39,886
l fall for that fucking
arrogant prick Jean-Marc

8
00:00:40,049 --> 00:00:42,317
who takes forever
to anmer my emails.

9
00:00:43,149 --> 00:00:44,450
I'm such a dumbass.

10
00:00:47,449 --> 00:00:48,483
Sometimes

11
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:50,950
I'm at my computer...

12
00:00:51,516 --> 00:00:52,750
and l panic.

13
00:00:53,383 --> 00:00:54,584
l get all worked up.

14
00:00:55,383 --> 00:00:56,383
l go,

15
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:59,852
if somebody died
evey time l hit Refresh,

16
00:01:00,716 --> 00:01:02,884
there'd be nobody left alive, fuck.

17
00:01:04,149 --> 00:01:06,518
When you go into a bar,
go for groceries,

18
00:01:06,683 --> 00:01:09,118
walk down the street, eat out...

19
00:01:10,149 --> 00:01:11,283
Whose ass do you check out?

20
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:14,752
When you're on the prowl,
is it tits or cocks?

21
00:01:16,149 --> 00:01:18,150
Tits, cocks? Cocks, tits?

22
00:01:18,316 --> 00:01:20,051
It was the cat.

23
00:01:20,383 --> 00:01:22,351
Marilyn. The cat was gone.

24
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:26,952
I knew right away because
Ididn't hear the tingaling.

25
00:01:27,116 --> 00:01:29,885
He'd put this collar on her...

26
00:01:30,049 --> 00:01:34,052
You know, for midgets...
for Santa's elves. A tiny bell.

27
00:01:34,216 --> 00:01:36,685
He put a bell on, thought it was cute.

28
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:38,651
You always heard it.

29
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:40,817
But l came home, she wasn't there.

30
00:01:41,349 --> 00:01:43,417
l went, Marilyn?

31
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:49,117
No bell.

32
00:01:50,249 --> 00:01:52,217
And the vase...

33
00:01:52,616 --> 00:01:56,019
in terracotta,
that was filled with

34
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,385
pennies and shit, on the bumet.

35
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:00,883
Gone.

36
00:02:01,683 --> 00:02:04,552
So l turn around
and next to the door

37
00:02:04,716 --> 00:02:07,218
just my boots.

38
00:02:07,783 --> 00:02:11,219
No running shoes.
No guy stum at all.

39
00:02:12,149 --> 00:02:16,253
So naturally l tear through
the place at like 250 mph.

40
00:02:17,483 --> 00:02:18,884
He'd taken eveything.

41
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:22,652
All... all... all his shit.

42
00:02:23,249 --> 00:02:26,852
On the kitchen table
there was a sheet of blue notepaper

43
00:02:27,016 --> 00:02:30,386
with, written in Gennan
- cause he was German...

44
00:02:30,816 --> 00:02:32,050
Must still be.

45
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:35,485
"l don't want to waste my life
Ioving you badly."

46
00:02:37,049 --> 00:02:38,383
You can't be 50-50.

47
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,751
Straight is straight, gay is gay.

48
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:43,318
And don't bring up
your "mood" crap.

49
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:45,585
The humidex
doesn't amect your libido.

50
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,418
Or the moon in Aquarius.

51
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:48,717
Gimme a fucking break!

52
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:50,183
l know eveything.

53
00:02:51,149 --> 00:02:52,216
Eveything.

54
00:02:53,516 --> 00:02:54,817
l know where he works,

55
00:02:54,983 --> 00:02:56,684
the restaurants he eats in.

56
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:58,984
l walked by his building.

57
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:01,217
Ran into thejanitor.

58
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:05,018
So l asked him,
dunno the fuck why,

59
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:07,685
if he was home.

60
00:03:08,182 --> 00:03:10,117
Janitor starts talking about him.

61
00:03:10,449 --> 00:03:11,850
l listen.

62
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:15,452
l start talking about him,
the little l knew.

63
00:03:15,616 --> 00:03:18,018
As if l knew him
since kindergarten.

64
00:03:19,249 --> 00:03:21,284
One point l realize I'm fucked.

65
00:03:21,549 --> 00:03:25,386
So l tell him to say
Cindy Rosenberg says hello.

66
00:03:25,483 --> 00:03:27,685
Not to look like a stalker.

67
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:30,084
If he had any idea...

68
00:03:30,316 --> 00:03:32,184
I am so well informed.

69
00:03:33,016 --> 00:03:34,851
His dad had a stroke in 2002.

70
00:03:35,016 --> 00:03:37,051
His mom owns a multicolored
wooden flowers stand

71
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:39,318
at Jocelyne's Treasures...

72
00:03:39,683 --> 00:03:40,583
If he knew,

73
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,752
he'd probably enter
the witness protection program

74
00:03:44,783 --> 00:03:46,684
for Mafia stools.

75
00:03:48,683 --> 00:03:50,284
Glenn Close in Fatal_ttraction.

76
00:03:50,883 --> 00:03:52,117
That's me.

77
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:22,485
Who is that self-satisfacted Adonis?

78
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:25,717
The blond?

79
00:04:29,149 --> 00:04:30,116
Nicolas.

80
00:04:30,716 --> 00:04:32,451
County lad. Friend of Sophie's.

81
00:04:33,116 --> 00:04:34,817
Just moved into town.

82
00:05:20,182 --> 00:05:25,320
HEARTBEATS

83
00:05:37,983 --> 00:05:39,050
- Hello.
- Marie?

84
00:05:40,149 --> 00:05:41,917
Guess who we're meeting Saturday?

85
00:06:27,983 --> 00:06:29,050
Seismography.

86
00:06:29,216 --> 00:06:32,185
You bore cables and sensors
into the ground.

87
00:06:32,516 --> 00:06:35,752
You blow it all up
and you can make maps.

88
00:06:36,182 --> 00:06:37,917
Based on the vibrations

89
00:06:38,082 --> 00:06:40,617
you can see what's underground.

90
00:06:41,182 --> 00:06:43,183
Oil companies pay
_200 mill for 'em.

91
00:06:43,483 --> 00:06:44,517
I'm crazy.

92
00:06:45,182 --> 00:06:48,285
We work 92-hourweeks
and with overtime

93
00:06:49,182 --> 00:06:51,884
you take home _1300 a week,
plus a fat tax refund,

94
00:06:52,049 --> 00:06:55,552
cause I'm studying literature
at McGill.

95
00:06:58,716 --> 00:07:00,784
l only do it for the money

96
00:07:01,249 --> 00:07:02,550
and to forget all the shit.

97
00:07:02,983 --> 00:07:05,518
At night I read
to exercise my brain.

98
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:08,619
Koltès keeps you in shape.

99
00:07:15,783 --> 00:07:17,351
- Well?
- Well, what?

100
00:07:18,182 --> 00:07:19,349
What do you think of Nicolas?

101
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:23,850
He's nice.

102
00:07:24,883 --> 00:07:26,517
Yeah, he's nice.

103
00:07:28,149 --> 00:07:29,450
He's intelligent.

104
00:07:33,082 --> 00:07:34,783
Penonally he's not my type.

105
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:41,951
Me neither.

106
00:08:45,082 --> 00:08:48,218
Thursday night we enter
a rowdy bar with flashy lights

107
00:08:48,549 --> 00:08:50,550
and order ales and lemonade?

108
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:54,451
- Hello?
- Hi, how are you?

109
00:08:55,116 --> 00:08:56,016
I'm good, you?

110
00:08:56,483 --> 00:08:57,450
Good.

111
00:08:57,883 --> 00:08:58,950
Guess what?

112
00:08:59,883 --> 00:09:01,451
l dunno.

113
00:09:01,716 --> 00:09:03,717
But Nico sent me a card.

114
00:09:06,283 --> 00:09:07,283
You got one too?

115
00:09:08,316 --> 00:09:10,584
Yeah, l got it this morning.

116
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,118
So, see you Thursday, then?

117
00:09:13,383 --> 00:09:14,784
It'll befun.

118
00:11:57,916 --> 00:11:59,484
Eating your chey, Tery?

119
00:12:00,449 --> 00:12:02,050
Chemies are too meet.

120
00:12:06,683 --> 00:12:08,918
Fudge is 1T times sweeter
than cherries.

121
00:12:15,216 --> 00:12:17,084
Ever play hide-and-seek?

122
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:18,883
Yeah.

123
00:12:20,149 --> 00:12:21,116
_nna play?

124
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:23,784
Like, on the mountain, maybe?

125
00:12:24,082 --> 00:12:25,016
Sure, but,

126
00:12:25,182 --> 00:12:26,416
do you need to change?

127
00:12:26,883 --> 00:12:29,085
Are you gonna wear that dress,
0_..._

128
00:12:32,116 --> 00:12:33,116
Cause you...

129
00:12:39,883 --> 00:12:41,284
Sporty.

130
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,383
One bottle ofwine.

131
00:12:47,549 --> 00:12:50,151
Two bottles ofwine.
Three bottles ofwine...

132
00:13:38,283 --> 00:13:39,417
Bunny!

133
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:44,684
Bunny!

134
00:14:08,216 --> 00:14:10,618
You must've sucked at this game
as a kid.

135
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:15,684
There was...

136
00:14:16,783 --> 00:14:18,284
l saw a white rabbit.

137
00:14:23,082 --> 00:14:25,451
A pet rabbit that probably escaped.

138
00:14:47,383 --> 00:14:48,450
Marie!

139
00:14:51,316 --> 00:14:52,283
Marie!

140
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:09,052
His dad knows a stage designer.
Nick asked me to his play.

141
00:15:11,116 --> 00:15:12,183
Cool.

142
00:15:30,016 --> 00:15:30,983
OK.

143
00:15:39,116 --> 00:15:40,383
You have a big bed, right?

144
00:15:43,616 --> 00:15:45,084
Yeah, l have a big bed.

145
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:52,118
You can sleep here. We'll just...

146
00:15:52,716 --> 00:15:54,050
We'll just squeeze in.

147
00:15:56,049 --> 00:15:57,150
Thanks, man.

148
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:58,583
Shotgun the side.

149
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,851
l hate the middle too!

150
00:16:00,016 --> 00:16:01,751
No sweat, l like the middle.

151
00:16:02,049 --> 00:16:03,083
Good.

152
00:16:09,016 --> 00:16:10,117
Sleeping tight, Marie?

153
00:17:04,249 --> 00:17:05,516
Not eating, Marie?

154
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:06,984
I'm not hungy.

155
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:12,452
An article on the play
l invited you to.

156
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:17,052
Francis, want me to ty
to get you a ticket?

157
00:17:20,883 --> 00:17:22,384
- It's on Thursday?
- Yeah.

158
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:27,219
No... I'm busy Thursday.

159
00:17:27,816 --> 00:17:28,850
Too bad.

160
00:17:28,983 --> 00:17:33,120
The play's sumealistic, but it's
based on an Audrey Hepburn movie.

161
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:34,951
The love of my life.

162
00:18:31,283 --> 00:18:32,417
Thanks. VMth one sugar.

163
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:35,619
Here you go. That's _2.25 please.

164
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:37,550
Thanks.
Keep the change.

165
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:38,683
Bye.

166
00:18:50,149 --> 00:18:51,149
Hey!

167
00:18:51,349 --> 00:18:53,884
- Hey, how's it going?
- Fine, you?

168
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:56,684
Yeah. What are you doing here?

169
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:58,651
- l live on Jeanne-Mance.
- Really?

170
00:18:58,816 --> 00:18:59,750
What's up?

171
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:03,286
l was grabbing a comee
with a friend. She just left.

172
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:05,184
Funny, cause l just...

173
00:19:05,349 --> 00:19:07,117
Dammit!
I'll just... Fuck, my comee!

174
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:12,385
_it, lemme show you.
Shit, l spilled it all over.

175
00:19:12,616 --> 00:19:14,284
Did l get you? Here you go...

176
00:19:15,483 --> 00:19:17,318
Lucky! Where'd you find it?

177
00:19:18,349 --> 00:19:19,349
I'm for you.

178
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:22,318
l bought it for you.

179
00:19:23,082 --> 00:19:24,216
Really, Frank...

180
00:19:24,683 --> 00:19:25,650
You're so meet!

181
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:27,451
- My pleasure.
- Thank you!

182
00:19:27,716 --> 00:19:29,984
You said you liked her
so I thought...

183
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:33,485
I gotta run.
I'm cooking for a girlfriend.

184
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:35,585
No womies.

185
00:19:37,016 --> 00:19:37,916
A girIfriend?

186
00:19:39,616 --> 00:19:41,250
Pesto with pine nuts.

187
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:42,583
There you go.

188
00:19:43,316 --> 00:19:46,318
But thanks a lot.
l can't wait to...

189
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:48,885
to put it up.

190
00:19:53,149 --> 00:19:54,316
I'm om.

191
00:19:54,483 --> 00:19:55,717
- I'll call you.
- OK.

192
00:19:56,049 --> 00:19:57,216
- See you!
- Bye.

193
00:19:57,383 --> 00:19:58,717
Don't forget your bags!

194
00:19:59,049 --> 00:20:02,318
Your pesto won't...
without the bags.

195
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:03,717
- Bye!
- Call me!

196
00:20:03,883 --> 00:20:05,317
- Yeah!
- OK!

197
00:20:28,216 --> 00:20:29,116
_s it bad?

198
00:20:29,549 --> 00:20:30,549
No, no.

199
00:20:30,783 --> 00:20:31,750
It was vey...

200
00:20:32,683 --> 00:20:33,583
engrossing.

201
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:38,683
You have amazing eyes.

202
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:40,950
Hazel?

203
00:20:41,483 --> 00:20:43,585
As banal an iris as they come.

204
00:20:45,016 --> 00:20:48,386
Ahigh IQ is a vital counterpoint
to brown eyes.

205
00:20:52,883 --> 00:20:55,885
Do you ever think of movie stan
when you fuck?

206
00:21:04,549 --> 00:21:06,350
No, l don't think of anything.

207
00:21:09,216 --> 00:21:11,751
Do you picture celebrities
during coitus?

208
00:21:13,249 --> 00:21:14,249
Yeah.

209
00:21:16,116 --> 00:21:18,551
But l don't need to with you.

210
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:24,418
Are you in love right now?

211
00:22:29,983 --> 00:22:33,986
Pains, Migraines and Sonatas

212
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:39,883
Pretty so-so, huh?

213
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:42,551
The dialogue was a mess.

214
00:22:44,549 --> 00:22:45,616
So pompous.

215
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:49,517
l heard the author on the radio.

216
00:22:49,883 --> 00:22:52,285
She called it the work
she least undentood.

217
00:22:54,383 --> 00:22:55,751
These pseudo borderlines...

218
00:22:55,916 --> 00:23:00,520
with their pain fetish
as an escape from existential ennui...

219
00:23:00,783 --> 00:23:01,683
Fuck om!

220
00:23:02,616 --> 00:23:04,451
Theyjust need to get laid.

221
00:23:08,082 --> 00:23:09,983
The authors have struck again.

222
00:23:10,449 --> 00:23:13,552
l was irrevocably scarred by
Wild _erries and Sodomy.

223
00:23:15,082 --> 00:23:17,350
The characters were so Manichean.

224
00:23:18,916 --> 00:23:19,883
Manichean?

225
00:23:20,616 --> 00:23:22,584
Manichean.

226
00:23:23,983 --> 00:23:26,285
You know, good venus evil.

227
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:28,685
All black or all white.

228
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:30,751
Yeah, l know what it means.

229
00:23:32,283 --> 00:23:34,752
l just found it channing
you'd use the word Manichean.

230
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:38,184
Seems out of character?

231
00:23:39,716 --> 00:23:42,185
No, not at all. On the contray.

232
00:23:51,983 --> 00:23:53,484
There's a little

233
00:23:54,283 --> 00:23:56,385
Vietnamese place near where I live.

234
00:23:57,249 --> 00:23:58,350
It might be

235
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:00,917
pleasant.

236
00:24:01,082 --> 00:24:02,149
Yeah, totally.

237
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:14,718
Marie, it's Frankie!

238
00:24:17,783 --> 00:24:18,717
Frankie!

239
00:24:18,883 --> 00:24:20,618
- What's up?
- We just saw the play.

240
00:24:20,916 --> 00:24:23,451
Shit, l forgot! It was tonight.

241
00:24:23,616 --> 00:24:26,552
Antony, this is Nico.
Nico, Antony...

242
00:24:29,216 --> 00:24:30,383
Nicolas, this is Jody.

243
00:24:30,549 --> 00:24:32,350
And Clara, Nicolas.

244
00:24:32,483 --> 00:24:33,483
Hi.

245
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:38,652
Didn't hurt too much
when you fell from heaven?

246
00:24:45,516 --> 00:24:46,984
How was the play?

247
00:24:47,149 --> 00:24:48,416
Disappointing.

248
00:24:50,149 --> 00:24:52,084
That's all? What a shame.

249
00:24:52,249 --> 00:24:54,284
- It wasn't good?
- It was awful.

250
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:58,885
But those actors are good.

251
00:24:59,516 --> 00:25:00,850
Well, they were awful.

252
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:05,519
Anyway, it's funny
you came here to eat.

253
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:26,617
I'm measurable.

254
00:26:26,783 --> 00:26:29,952
The Kinsey scale has T categories,
T degrees.

255
00:26:30,216 --> 00:26:33,018
O) Exclusively heterosexual.

256
00:26:33,182 --> 00:26:37,152
1) Predominantly heterosexual,
incidentally homosexual.

257
00:26:37,383 --> 00:26:41,920
2) Predominantly heterosexual,
more than incidentally homosexual,

258
00:26:42,149 --> 00:26:44,784
- like Jean.
- Go fuck younelf!

259
00:26:45,983 --> 00:26:48,151
3) Bisexual with no preference.

260
00:26:48,783 --> 00:26:52,553
4) Predominantly homosexual,
incidentally heterosexual.

261
00:26:52,716 --> 00:26:56,886
5) Predominantly homosexual,
more than incidentally heterosexual.

262
00:26:57,049 --> 00:26:59,818
And 6) Exclusively homosexual.

263
00:27:01,316 --> 00:27:02,684
Where do you fall on the scale?

264
00:27:04,216 --> 00:27:06,551
The Golden Coconut Club.

265
00:27:08,683 --> 00:27:09,950
No, Golden Coconut Depot.

266
00:27:10,516 --> 00:27:14,453
Yeah.
We shared a little Californian wine.

267
00:27:16,016 --> 00:27:17,384
And we split a

268
00:27:19,783 --> 00:27:20,950
fried banana.

269
00:27:21,116 --> 00:27:22,383
Then...

270
00:27:23,049 --> 00:27:24,583
we went dutch, because...

271
00:27:26,549 --> 00:27:27,516
I
well

272
00:27:28,449 --> 00:27:29,750
I wanted it to be clear.

273
00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:33,017
Then I gave her a lift to the metro.

274
00:27:33,182 --> 00:27:35,651
It must've been, 11:15?

275
00:27:37,516 --> 00:27:40,151
And I went for a beerwith friends.

276
00:27:44,149 --> 00:27:45,884
Oh, and my ex was there.

277
00:27:46,916 --> 00:27:48,217
The day he moved in,

278
00:27:48,783 --> 00:27:50,885
it was over. It was over!

279
00:27:51,383 --> 00:27:53,585
No, l mean, it wasn't over, over.

280
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:57,620
l mean, we still lived together
and had sex and all, but...

281
00:27:57,783 --> 00:28:00,385
But those are details, meaningless.

282
00:28:01,916 --> 00:28:02,883
It was over.

283
00:28:03,916 --> 00:28:05,817
Of coune at first

284
00:28:06,182 --> 00:28:08,317
we didn't want to admit it

285
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:11,619
cause we felt bad, you know.

286
00:28:13,616 --> 00:28:16,051
The move, all the cargo...

287
00:28:16,249 --> 00:28:19,318
All that... all that stum.

288
00:28:19,516 --> 00:28:22,886
That's a shitload of money
out the window.

289
00:28:23,449 --> 00:28:25,984
That said, mein Hem
is making Euros,

290
00:28:26,149 --> 00:28:28,217
so he can go fuck himself.

291
00:28:28,383 --> 00:28:30,051
I'm like we were...

292
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:33,886
"We..." I mean, I'll speak for myself.

293
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:35,750
Me...

294
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:37,617
For me...

295
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:42,353
l was infatuated
with the kind of love we had.

296
00:28:43,416 --> 00:28:45,417
He lived in BerIin,

297
00:28:45,583 --> 00:28:47,584
me, on Dorion St, so...

298
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:51,119
l guess l was in love with,

299
00:28:51,283 --> 00:28:53,251
you know, taking the plane and

300
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:56,251
l dunno, landing, the cafés,

301
00:28:56,850 --> 00:28:58,551
the cigarettes and...

302
00:28:59,149 --> 00:29:00,984
wind from elsewhere,

303
00:29:01,983 --> 00:29:03,184
his accent.

304
00:29:04,283 --> 00:29:05,450
It doesn't exist.

305
00:29:06,416 --> 00:29:08,151
I'm the concept you love.

306
00:29:08,683 --> 00:29:11,452
You love the concept more than him.

307
00:29:12,149 --> 00:29:13,850
I'm the distance you love.

308
00:29:14,716 --> 00:29:17,585
But when there's no more distance...

309
00:29:18,116 --> 00:29:19,150
When...

310
00:29:19,816 --> 00:29:21,784
when there's no more ocean to cross

311
00:29:22,016 --> 00:29:24,218
and all there's left to cross
is a hallway...

312
00:29:26,416 --> 00:29:27,416
Anyway,

313
00:29:29,082 --> 00:29:30,249
it's over now.

314
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:35,852
The letter l got two days after

315
00:29:37,483 --> 00:29:38,450
our evening out.

316
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:45,384
"My dear Julien,

317
00:29:46,883 --> 00:29:50,686
l can't stop thinking
about our enchanting tête-à-tête.

318
00:29:51,449 --> 00:29:54,051
Your humor and gallanty seduced me.

319
00:29:55,283 --> 00:29:58,619
Yesterday l went to
the Northland Mall with the girls.

320
00:29:59,249 --> 00:30:01,084
l think l found your perFume.

00:30:07,916 --> 00:30:09,951
from Colin Arpel, by chance?"

323
00:30:16,983 --> 00:30:18,017
No, it's not.

324
00:30:18,549 --> 00:30:20,217
"My top moment of our night?

325
00:30:21,149 --> 00:30:25,353
Definitely when you kissed me
on the cheek at the metro station,

326
00:30:25,516 --> 00:30:27,084
almost grazing my cheek.

327
00:30:29,783 --> 00:30:31,217
I shut my eyes

328
00:30:31,383 --> 00:30:34,853
and felt transported
to the Champ_EURlysées."

Uses "vous" with me.

Who are we,
fucking de Musset and Georges Sand?

00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:56,452
Pussy-footing. l hate pussy-footing.

335
00:30:57,650 --> 00:31:00,819
Now he's ruining
all my favorite places because

336
00:31:01,549 --> 00:31:02,716
when he's not there,

337
00:31:03,049 --> 00:31:05,317
having a beer with friends...

338
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:07,218
When he's not there,

339
00:31:08,149 --> 00:31:09,049
I'm bored.

340
00:31:09,983 --> 00:31:11,150
I'm no fun.

341
00:31:11,783 --> 00:31:15,620
Yet, the weather's nice,
birds are singing, the wine's good...

342
00:31:15,816 --> 00:31:17,317
l mean: Shut up, bitch!

343
00:31:18,249 --> 00:31:19,383
But it's no fun.

344
00:31:21,182 --> 00:31:22,750
When he's there, watch out!

345
00:31:23,082 --> 00:31:26,151
Like l popped 5 tabs of speed.
l say hi to eveyone.

346
00:31:27,483 --> 00:31:29,518
l act like I'm straight om the farm.

347
00:31:29,783 --> 00:31:31,584
St Donat. Howdy!

348
00:31:33,283 --> 00:31:34,851
Worst, l hardly talk to him.

349
00:31:36,216 --> 00:31:37,483
But l know he sees me.

350
00:31:38,316 --> 00:31:40,484
You see people even if you don't look.

351
00:31:42,116 --> 00:31:43,450
Like, if you're there.

352
00:31:44,082 --> 00:31:45,082
And I'm looking here.

353
00:31:47,416 --> 00:31:48,383
I see you.

354
00:31:48,683 --> 00:31:50,618
I'm not looking, but l see you.

355
00:31:51,449 --> 00:31:52,449
l know

356
00:31:53,249 --> 00:31:55,050
where you're looking. l know

357
00:31:55,983 --> 00:31:57,250
you're looking at me.

358
00:31:58,149 --> 00:31:59,283
Mother fucker.

359
00:32:01,383 --> 00:32:02,350
OK.

360
00:32:08,616 --> 00:32:09,650
You smell good.

361
00:32:10,616 --> 00:32:11,516
Thanks.

362
00:32:17,583 --> 00:32:18,884
Oh, God...

363
00:32:20,349 --> 00:32:23,952
"Tick-tock goes your biological clock,
but where is Mister Right?

364
00:32:25,216 --> 00:32:26,517
Modern fashionistas,

365
00:32:26,683 --> 00:32:28,985
what kind of man makes you drool?

366
00:32:30,483 --> 00:32:33,786
1) Describe the looks of the man
ofyour dreams."

367
00:32:38,049 --> 00:32:39,083
What, now?

368
00:32:39,683 --> 00:32:40,717
Yeah.

369
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:52,618
Brown hai... brown eyes.

370
00:32:53,549 --> 00:32:55,350
For sure. Brown hair.

371
00:32:59,716 --> 00:33:01,250
Down to here, about.

372
00:33:01,583 --> 00:33:02,951
Short.

373
00:33:03,216 --> 00:33:06,052
No, short... Well, curIy.

374
00:33:07,416 --> 00:33:10,085
Below the ears.
Almost shoulder-length.

375
00:33:10,683 --> 00:33:11,917
Curly, blond.

376
00:33:17,283 --> 00:33:20,152
And green eyes, maybe.

377
00:34:58,516 --> 00:34:59,550
This is so beautiful.

378
00:35:01,049 --> 00:35:03,117
"ln love when l ask for a look,

379
00:35:03,549 --> 00:35:07,019
what is deeply unsatis_ing
and always futile,

380
00:35:07,249 --> 00:35:09,217
is that you never look at me

381
00:35:09,383 --> 00:35:10,784
from where l see you."

382
00:35:14,916 --> 00:35:17,652
Smoke break. I'll wait outside.

383
00:39:07,583 --> 00:39:08,617
My friends!

384
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:22,484
My friend!

385
00:39:29,983 --> 00:39:31,084
Where do we put the gifts?

386
00:39:32,816 --> 00:39:34,484
Shit, l am so wasted.

387
00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:37,119
l've never been this drunk
in my life!

388
00:39:38,082 --> 00:39:39,817
- What?
- Where do we put the gifts?

389
00:39:40,716 --> 00:39:42,651
Oh yeah, right!

390
00:39:43,049 --> 00:39:44,583
I
At the end of the hall

391
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:47,951
the room to the right
of the dining room.

392
00:39:51,182 --> 00:39:53,918
They bought me presents!
That's so cute!

393
00:40:06,783 --> 00:40:07,850
Wow.

394
00:40:08,416 --> 00:40:09,917
He's super drunk.

395
00:40:15,816 --> 00:40:16,816
A boater.

396
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:19,785
- I bought him a boater.
- Yes!

397
00:40:20,683 --> 00:40:21,717
Beautiful, huh?

398
00:40:22,149 --> 00:40:23,617
l just hope

399
00:40:24,149 --> 00:40:25,583
he doesn't vomit in it.

400
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:28,551
No, joking.

401
00:40:29,716 --> 00:40:31,684
He'll be super happy. It's cool!

402
00:40:32,316 --> 00:40:33,383
Yours? Yours?

403
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:36,984
I'm... It's a little...

404
00:40:37,149 --> 00:40:38,984
I'm not as original.

405
00:40:39,816 --> 00:40:41,484
Just some threads.

406
00:40:41,716 --> 00:40:44,485
l wanna see!
You have such great taste!

407
00:40:51,716 --> 00:40:52,783
Orange!

408
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:53,884
Tangerine.

409
00:40:54,516 --> 00:40:55,650
I'm tangerine.

410
00:40:56,283 --> 00:40:58,685
Blond hair and citrus tones...

411
00:40:59,049 --> 00:41:00,850
always a victorious partnership.

412
00:41:01,483 --> 00:41:02,817
Well, l mean...

413
00:41:03,549 --> 00:41:05,384
Maybe, l dunno...

414
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:07,418
l've heard that orange

415
00:41:08,016 --> 00:41:10,251
is a safe pick for any skin tone.

416
00:41:10,783 --> 00:41:12,751
Dunno about fluorescent orange,
though.

417
00:41:12,916 --> 00:41:14,550
That may be the exception.

418
00:41:16,383 --> 00:41:17,917
It'll go with my boater.

419
00:41:27,816 --> 00:41:28,850
You look great.

420
00:41:30,049 --> 00:41:32,151
Thanks, that's sweet. You too.

421
00:41:34,383 --> 00:41:35,350
Bling bling!

422
00:41:36,182 --> 00:41:37,082
They're precious.

423
00:42:30,216 --> 00:42:31,350
What a party!

424
00:42:32,683 --> 00:42:34,017
"T'as de beaux yeux, tu sais!"

425
00:42:40,383 --> 00:42:41,784
Know where that's from?

426
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:43,151
Yeah, sure.

427
00:42:45,349 --> 00:42:46,383
So?

428
00:42:48,516 --> 00:42:49,617
So what?

429
00:42:51,850 --> 00:42:53,318
So what comes next?

430
00:42:54,583 --> 00:42:55,750
l dunno.

431
00:43:49,783 --> 00:43:51,851
"What a party!"

432
00:43:56,116 --> 00:43:57,116
ldiot!

433
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:20,284
Who's that android?

434
00:44:21,716 --> 00:44:22,783
His mother.

435
00:44:23,082 --> 00:44:25,117
Her name is Désirée.

436
00:44:28,383 --> 00:44:29,917
He introduced me to her.

437
00:44:30,082 --> 00:44:32,417
She said l looked like a 50s housewife.

438
00:44:32,816 --> 00:44:35,251
Who is she anyway?
Captain Spock's wet-nurse?

439
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:38,652
Or pemaps a prostitute
_rom Blade Runner?

440
00:44:40,583 --> 00:44:42,518
Your dress is a tad anachronistic.

441
00:44:43,149 --> 00:44:44,116
So_?

442
00:44:44,816 --> 00:44:46,284
This is vintage, dearie!

443
00:44:48,216 --> 00:44:50,518
Not all vintage should come back.

444
00:47:43,449 --> 00:47:44,983
Know what we should do?

445
00:47:45,182 --> 00:47:46,082
No, what?

446
00:47:46,349 --> 00:47:48,517
Go to my aunt's cottage
for the weekend.

447
00:47:48,850 --> 00:47:51,452
She's in Europe.
l know where she hides the keys.

448
00:47:51,783 --> 00:47:52,984
But l have to work.

449
00:47:53,683 --> 00:47:55,418
Just call in sick.

450
00:47:56,916 --> 00:47:57,850
Right.

451
00:47:58,583 --> 00:48:00,685
"Hi, this is Marie,
and l am sick."

452
00:48:01,249 --> 00:48:04,051
"Hi, this is Sick,
and l am Marie."

453
00:48:04,816 --> 00:48:06,083
OK, I'll call.

454
00:48:06,916 --> 00:48:09,051
How are we gonna get there?

455
00:48:10,483 --> 00:48:11,784
Saddle up a cat?

456
00:48:12,616 --> 00:48:14,517
- Magic carpet.
- No, by car.

457
00:48:15,016 --> 00:48:17,685
I'll borrow JP's wheels.
He won't mind.

458
00:48:18,616 --> 00:48:20,184
l better go now.

459
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:21,684
Who wants to come?

460
00:48:22,082 --> 00:48:24,784
But someone stays.
My mom's bringing some cash.

461
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:26,985
l need to buy cigarettes.

462
00:48:29,816 --> 00:48:31,083
You'll see, Francis.

463
00:48:31,216 --> 00:48:32,784
My mom's cool.

464
00:48:34,816 --> 00:48:36,217
Can you zip me up?

465
00:48:39,716 --> 00:48:40,683
You're good?

466
00:48:41,449 --> 00:48:42,483
Thanks.

467
00:48:43,483 --> 00:48:45,017
- Shall we?
- Yeah, let's go.

468
00:48:46,182 --> 00:48:48,117
- Later, Francis.
- Later.

469
00:50:18,716 --> 00:50:19,783
Hello.

470
00:50:35,616 --> 00:50:37,250
The party was a fuckin' blast.

471
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:39,118
Have you known Nick long?

472
00:50:39,916 --> 00:50:41,851
- About mo months.
- Two months!

473
00:50:42,683 --> 00:50:43,750
François, right?

474
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:46,017
Francis, right!

475
00:50:47,650 --> 00:50:49,151
He's talked aboutyou.

476
00:50:50,650 --> 00:50:52,518
I'm true, you're a cutie!

477
00:51:00,883 --> 00:51:03,018
Nice place, huh?Afriggin' palace!

478
00:51:04,216 --> 00:51:05,817
His dad pays for it.

479
00:51:06,983 --> 00:51:09,018
That dick thinks
he's King of the World.

480
00:51:12,883 --> 00:51:13,883
l love your...

481
00:51:15,216 --> 00:51:18,419
What you're wearing, your top.

482
00:51:20,116 --> 00:51:21,617
This? Thanks, sweetie.

483
00:51:21,783 --> 00:51:23,985
Got it in New York,
like, 10 years ago.

484
00:51:25,116 --> 00:51:27,184
I'm a dancer, l pack light.

485
00:51:27,349 --> 00:51:29,150
Don't travel much now, but...

486
00:51:30,182 --> 00:51:31,182
Ask Nick.

487
00:51:31,283 --> 00:51:33,818
As a kid he loved being backstage.

488
00:51:35,349 --> 00:51:37,517
His dad thought it was heavy.

489
00:51:37,683 --> 00:51:39,818
Said it was vulgar. "I'm vulgar!"

490
00:51:40,149 --> 00:51:42,718
What's a pair of tits to a toddle_
Fuck om.

491
00:51:44,149 --> 00:51:45,450
But ask Nick.

492
00:51:48,716 --> 00:51:50,751
l wonder if he still remembers.

493
00:51:51,182 --> 00:51:54,718
The girls were crazy about him,
smothered him with kisses.

494
00:51:55,149 --> 00:51:56,884
He loved it. He was cute.

495
00:51:58,116 --> 00:51:59,183
Yeah.

496
00:51:59,716 --> 00:52:01,117
He must remember.

497
00:52:02,082 --> 00:52:03,149
But we lost touch.

498
00:52:03,483 --> 00:52:06,319
l mean, Miami
Fort Lauderdale, Ixt!apa...

499
00:52:07,583 --> 00:52:08,717
Dimerent time zones.

500
00:52:08,883 --> 00:52:11,252
His dad snatched him back, pronto.

501
00:52:12,883 --> 00:52:14,517
Father kn_s best.

502
00:52:19,216 --> 00:52:20,350
Say that again.

503
00:52:20,583 --> 00:52:22,051
He's gotta remember.

504
00:52:22,583 --> 00:52:23,850
The dressing rooms.

505
00:52:24,383 --> 00:52:27,285
l brought him this, his allowance.

506
00:52:28,850 --> 00:52:31,686
Grocey, lottey, candy, whatever.

507
00:52:32,016 --> 00:52:33,650
Show him. He's an aimead.

508
00:52:33,816 --> 00:52:36,652
He'll toss it out.
Ciao sweet dough!

509
00:52:37,616 --> 00:52:38,583
Not home?

510
00:52:39,283 --> 00:52:42,452
l hoped to give him a smooch.
Where the fuck is he?

511
00:52:42,616 --> 00:52:44,617
He'll be back. He's out with...

512
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:46,817
Marie.

513
00:52:48,449 --> 00:52:49,983
You'll tell him, right?

514
00:52:50,149 --> 00:52:52,451
Give him a kiss from me,
huh, twinkie?

515
00:52:52,583 --> 00:52:54,184
He'll be glad, I'm sure.

516
00:52:54,716 --> 00:52:56,784
- Nice meeting you, Francis.
- Me, too.

517
00:52:56,950 --> 00:52:58,151
You are a cutie.

518
00:53:01,983 --> 00:53:03,851
- Bye.
- Have a nice day.

519
00:53:04,016 --> 00:53:07,519
Don't forget to tell him
or he'll toss it out.

520
00:53:08,249 --> 00:53:09,783
He's an airhead.

521
00:53:09,950 --> 00:53:11,785
- Bye.
- Have a nice day.

522
00:54:50,583 --> 00:54:52,084
The county's so beautiful.

523
00:54:54,650 --> 00:54:56,018
We tend to forget.

524
00:55:10,850 --> 00:55:12,084
Audrey Hepburn!

525
00:55:14,216 --> 00:55:15,951
_reaMast at Ti_any's.

526
00:55:16,082 --> 00:55:18,584
That's where it's from! l forgot!

527
00:55:19,283 --> 00:55:21,385
l adoreAudrey Hepburn!

528
00:55:21,583 --> 00:55:22,583
Me...

529
00:55:29,383 --> 00:55:30,884
Gotta piss. Be right back.

530
00:55:36,616 --> 00:55:37,583
Marie?

531
00:55:39,783 --> 00:55:40,783
l love you.

532
00:55:41,716 --> 00:55:42,883
l love you too.

533
00:55:43,583 --> 00:55:45,985
Frankie, too. l love the dude.

534
00:55:46,149 --> 00:55:47,617
l mean, he's so meet!

535
00:55:48,383 --> 00:55:50,384
- A bit shy, but...
- Over-sensitive?

536
00:55:51,149 --> 00:55:52,149
Yeah.

537
00:55:53,416 --> 00:55:56,018
- In what way, sensitive?
- No, nothing.

538
00:56:02,449 --> 00:56:03,683
No, it'sjust he's...

539
00:56:05,750 --> 00:56:06,884
He's a romantic.

540
00:56:08,249 --> 00:56:10,117
He imagines things about people.

541
00:56:15,883 --> 00:56:17,484
What do you mean?

542
00:56:21,149 --> 00:56:23,084
I'm just he imagines things,

543
00:56:23,816 --> 00:56:25,918
about anything, anyone...

544
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:28,784
If you give him too much amection,

545
00:56:29,583 --> 00:56:31,184
or touch him too much...

546
00:56:32,616 --> 00:56:33,850
Like, for him,

547
00:56:34,316 --> 00:56:36,017
"l love you" is

548
00:56:36,983 --> 00:56:38,150
"l love you."

549
00:56:40,716 --> 00:56:42,284
You can say it to me.

550
00:56:42,683 --> 00:56:44,618
l undentand these kind of things.

551
00:56:46,516 --> 00:56:47,516
But him...

552
00:56:49,082 --> 00:56:50,116
An_ay...

553
00:56:55,049 --> 00:56:56,417
Lunch is on me.

554
00:57:15,883 --> 00:57:16,850
River.

555
00:57:18,750 --> 00:57:20,518
Yeah, it's beautiful.

556
00:57:20,916 --> 00:57:21,883
I'm crazy.

557
00:57:34,750 --> 00:57:36,518
Yeah, the county is beautiful.

558
00:57:42,016 --> 00:57:43,350
You forget eveything.

559
00:57:44,416 --> 00:57:46,818
All the shit that drives you crazy.

560
00:57:47,750 --> 00:57:48,884
You forget.

561
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:05,351
Next marshmallow?

562
00:59:05,516 --> 00:59:06,650
Not me, thanks.

563
00:59:06,983 --> 00:59:07,950
Frankie?

564
00:59:08,549 --> 00:59:09,549
OK.

565
00:59:14,182 --> 00:59:16,083
You don't know how to eat 'em.

566
00:59:20,283 --> 00:59:21,250
Why?

567
00:59:22,049 --> 00:59:23,950
You eat your manhmallow too fast.

568
00:59:25,216 --> 00:59:27,084
You're not tasting it.

569
00:59:28,316 --> 00:59:30,184
Amarshmallow's like a striptease.

570
00:59:30,316 --> 00:59:32,251
Step by step.

571
00:59:32,883 --> 00:59:34,484
- Have another...
- No.

572
00:59:34,650 --> 00:59:35,917
Man, I'm full, l swear.

573
00:59:36,316 --> 00:59:37,283
Come on.

574
00:59:39,483 --> 00:59:41,017
Now do as l say.

575
00:59:41,916 --> 00:59:43,884
Start by taking om its coat.

576
00:59:44,049 --> 00:59:44,949
Come again?

577
00:59:45,116 --> 00:59:47,151
Its coat.
Its little peel, its skin.

578
00:59:47,816 --> 00:59:50,251
The burned, golden layer.

579
00:59:50,783 --> 00:59:51,884
Start with that.

580
00:59:52,349 --> 00:59:53,349
OK.

581
00:59:55,182 --> 00:59:56,583
Good start. Now,

582
00:59:57,916 --> 01:00:01,653
using your palate and incisors,
pull ofF the second part

583
01:00:01,816 --> 01:00:04,518
by applying a teeny
slight pressure.

584
01:00:04,683 --> 01:00:06,017
But you leave...

585
01:00:06,549 --> 01:00:08,284
you leave a thin core.

586
01:00:11,716 --> 01:00:12,683
And then...

587
01:00:16,316 --> 01:00:17,684
You're so drunk.

588
01:00:19,483 --> 01:00:20,717
OK, I'm going to bed.

589
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:22,884
You're angy?

590
01:00:23,249 --> 01:00:24,650
No no, just tired.

591
01:00:26,516 --> 01:00:28,618
- You OK?
- Yeah, yeah.

592
01:01:40,783 --> 01:01:41,884
Guys?

593
01:02:51,816 --> 01:02:53,918
Whatever! Whatever!

594
01:02:54,082 --> 01:02:55,917
Whatever! Whatever!

595
01:03:24,383 --> 01:03:25,851
Yeah, it's me.

596
01:03:26,583 --> 01:03:27,717
Yes, on the clim.

597
01:03:28,750 --> 01:03:31,252
Yes. No, I'm going to take the bus.

598
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:34,852
An emergency. l forgot l had
an emergency in Montréal.

599
01:03:35,483 --> 01:03:37,418
I'll take the bus in an hour.

600
01:03:38,249 --> 01:03:40,818
Don't go to any trouble for me.
It's fine.

601
01:03:40,983 --> 01:03:42,184
I'll just take the bus.

602
01:03:42,883 --> 01:03:43,817
Bye.

603
01:04:01,383 --> 01:04:02,383
Marie!

604
01:04:04,583 --> 01:04:05,750
_it!

605
01:04:21,850 --> 01:04:23,051
Marie, fuck!

606
01:04:54,383 --> 01:04:55,917
What's your fucking problem?

607
01:05:50,983 --> 01:05:52,584
Hey, guys?

608
01:06:03,283 --> 01:06:05,018
l've had it with the county.

609
01:06:05,182 --> 01:06:06,182
I'm going home.

610
01:06:09,216 --> 01:06:10,350
Love me or leave me.

611
01:06:42,049 --> 01:06:44,785
We've been waiting
outside the hotel for

612
01:06:45,516 --> 01:06:46,884
15, even 25 minutes.

613
01:06:47,383 --> 01:06:48,383
Endless!

614
01:06:48,850 --> 01:06:50,184
I'm raining.

615
01:06:50,349 --> 01:06:53,251
Abitchy little drizzle like,
you know,

616
01:06:53,416 --> 01:06:55,684
someone's goddamn spitting
in your face.

617
01:06:56,750 --> 01:06:59,486
My balls are ice cold,
I'm insanely bored.

618
01:06:59,616 --> 01:07:01,451
Julie's reading some poems by...

619
01:07:01,616 --> 01:07:03,284
Jacques Brault.

620
01:07:03,850 --> 01:07:06,819
I'm taking forever,
he's late, we're bored.

621
01:07:07,449 --> 01:07:10,084
But Julie's gonna shoot herself
if we bail.

622
01:07:10,349 --> 01:07:12,317
There's an old doorman
from Colorado.

623
01:07:12,483 --> 01:07:16,520
No idea what he's doing there.
But he's nice so we chat.

624
01:07:17,616 --> 01:07:18,683
Finally he shows up.

625
01:07:20,182 --> 01:07:21,516
That bitch is like...

626
01:07:22,449 --> 01:07:23,516
45 minutes late.

627
01:07:24,182 --> 01:07:25,182
He's wearing

628
01:07:25,349 --> 01:07:27,651
his vintage Na_ jacket.

629
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:30,084
He's cute. He's tall and...

630
01:07:31,149 --> 01:07:33,317
We're there so Julie
can make her move.

631
01:07:33,650 --> 01:07:35,785
I'm now or never. Problem is,

632
01:07:36,916 --> 01:07:37,883
the guy

633
01:07:38,283 --> 01:07:39,317
is with someone.

634
01:07:40,583 --> 01:07:41,684
Another guy!

635
01:07:42,049 --> 01:07:44,951
Also cute and tall.
l glance at Julie.

636
01:07:46,016 --> 01:07:47,751
Her face looks like shit.

637
01:07:49,616 --> 01:07:50,516
Dude's like,

638
01:07:50,683 --> 01:07:53,385
"Sory, l lost. l late."

639
01:07:54,449 --> 01:07:56,584
You don't call, you don't write,

640
01:07:56,883 --> 01:07:58,150
or talk to her. Over.

641
01:07:59,616 --> 01:08:02,552
If you know she's at a party or bar,

642
01:08:02,716 --> 01:08:04,017
you don't go.

643
01:08:05,116 --> 01:08:07,318
It took me about a year.

644
01:08:09,416 --> 01:08:11,384
The lucky ones get over it

645
01:08:11,616 --> 01:08:13,751
in mo weeks, mo months,
mo days...

646
01:08:16,449 --> 01:08:18,184
Evey time l saw her l figured

647
01:08:18,416 --> 01:08:21,352
I'd get cramps,
bejealous of her new BF.

648
01:08:23,483 --> 01:08:24,450
But no.

649
01:08:26,216 --> 01:08:27,850
l got over it.

650
01:08:29,082 --> 01:08:30,817
I
Autumn leaves fell

651
01:08:31,049 --> 01:08:33,151
SnOW Came.

652
01:08:33,349 --> 01:08:36,318
Christmas, and my cousins
with their dumb girlfriends.

653
01:08:37,883 --> 01:08:40,318
Spring, summer, fall and...

654
01:08:41,516 --> 01:08:42,617
I got over it.

655
01:08:43,483 --> 01:08:45,351
Just a bad memoy.

656
01:08:47,383 --> 01:08:48,717
Amemoy like many others.

657
01:08:51,783 --> 01:08:53,117
When I think ofwhat I did,

658
01:08:53,249 --> 01:08:58,420
the money I blew
to get her to love me...

659
01:08:58,583 --> 01:09:00,051
I think of it all and

660
01:09:02,850 --> 01:09:04,251
I'm so ashamed that...

661
01:09:11,216 --> 01:09:12,650
I start to...

662
01:09:14,650 --> 01:09:15,650
to sing.

663
01:09:16,549 --> 01:09:17,917
To sing, fuck!

664
01:09:18,616 --> 01:09:20,751
I sing in the living room,
in the shower

665
01:09:20,916 --> 01:09:22,684
doing the dishes.

666
01:09:23,816 --> 01:09:24,816
I sing.

667
01:09:27,950 --> 01:09:29,618
I hit Send.

668
01:09:30,850 --> 01:09:32,451
I mean, enough's enough.

669
01:09:33,182 --> 01:09:36,652
Smell the comee.
Not spend my whole life on Hotmail.

670
01:09:37,983 --> 01:09:40,485
I mean, it's cute at first, but...

671
01:09:43,182 --> 01:09:44,783
I'm such a high.

672
01:09:45,750 --> 01:09:47,284
You know, the feeling

673
01:09:47,383 --> 01:09:49,785
when your Inbox has new messages,

674
01:09:50,016 --> 01:09:51,016
in bold.

675
01:09:51,650 --> 01:09:53,752
You have mail!

676
01:09:55,283 --> 01:09:57,184
The nanosecond after you click

677
01:09:58,816 --> 01:09:59,917
and it appears.

678
01:10:01,516 --> 01:10:02,483
He wrote.

679
01:10:04,783 --> 01:10:06,684
You're even happier cause twice

680
01:10:06,850 --> 01:10:08,751
your Inbox's been in bold.

681
01:10:08,916 --> 01:10:11,685
An email from fucking Amazon.ca!

682
01:10:11,850 --> 01:10:14,452
Or a lampshade warehouse sale.

683
01:10:16,082 --> 01:10:18,184
I'm in a café. I'm waiting for him.

684
01:10:19,249 --> 01:10:20,350
And he's late.

685
01:10:21,082 --> 01:10:23,851
But only a minute,
so it's not serious.

686
01:10:25,449 --> 01:10:26,883
So, stage one:

687
01:10:27,683 --> 01:10:29,618
loving his being late.

688
01:10:29,983 --> 01:10:32,218
You go, it makes him human,

689
01:10:32,683 --> 01:10:34,284
gives him sex appeal.

690
01:10:34,716 --> 01:10:35,683
Stage mo:

691
01:10:35,850 --> 01:10:37,918
Checking my agenda. You know,

692
01:10:38,616 --> 01:10:40,351
I question myself.

693
01:10:40,650 --> 01:10:43,252
Maybe I got it wrong.
I invent scenarios.

694
01:10:43,483 --> 01:10:46,552
I picture myself arriving late
at another café.

695
01:10:47,049 --> 01:10:48,984
So I look where I am and

696
01:10:49,416 --> 01:10:51,618
I'm in the right place.

697
01:10:52,449 --> 01:10:53,950
I'm been 32 minutes.

698
01:10:55,516 --> 01:10:56,483
Stage three:

699
01:10:56,616 --> 01:10:59,752
I tell myself I don't mind waiting.

700
01:11:01,716 --> 01:11:03,784
I keep myself busy, I read.

701
01:11:04,016 --> 01:11:06,718
I pretend to read.
The same fucking paragraph.

702
01:11:07,082 --> 01:11:09,918
I go to the bathroom, order stum.

703
01:11:10,182 --> 01:11:11,383
Now I hate him.

704
01:11:11,983 --> 01:11:13,818
I insult him in my head.

705
01:11:14,283 --> 01:11:18,086
I think of cool quotes that'll be
perfect for when he shows up.

706
01:11:18,416 --> 01:11:20,251
I'm been 39 minutes.

707
01:11:23,249 --> 01:11:24,249
He arrives.

708
01:11:25,016 --> 01:11:26,283
All out of breath.

709
01:11:27,750 --> 01:11:29,051
Handsome.

710
01:11:30,483 --> 01:11:32,184
TraMc was bad.

711
01:11:33,182 --> 01:11:34,149
Yeah.

712
01:11:35,383 --> 01:11:37,451
So I excuse him. I say,

713
01:11:37,683 --> 01:11:40,252
of course, only normal
that he's late.

714
01:11:42,283 --> 01:11:43,384
Cause...

715
01:11:44,116 --> 01:11:46,218
Cause I'm weak and

716
01:11:46,883 --> 01:11:49,652
someone you put on a pedestal
is always right.

717
01:11:54,149 --> 01:11:55,350
Fuck it.

718
01:11:55,616 --> 01:11:56,717
Rejection's tough but...

719
01:11:57,483 --> 01:11:58,550
it's over with.

720
01:12:01,316 --> 01:12:02,316
No?

721
01:12:05,516 --> 01:12:07,351
I'm like a guillotine.

722
01:12:09,549 --> 01:12:10,616
But...

723
01:12:10,783 --> 01:12:12,251
waiting for an answer,

724
01:12:13,116 --> 01:12:15,318
spending weeks thinking I'm shit,

725
01:12:15,516 --> 01:12:17,784
while he goes, is she crazy?

726
01:12:18,583 --> 01:12:21,519
I'm like getting your head
chopped om in slo-mo.

727
01:12:22,249 --> 01:12:24,551
I'm like a long, lingering No.

728
01:12:27,449 --> 01:12:28,683
But at a certain point,

729
01:12:29,650 --> 01:12:30,984
you get fed up.

730
01:12:31,549 --> 01:12:32,883
You crack.

731
01:12:34,082 --> 01:12:35,650
You crack and

732
01:12:35,816 --> 01:12:37,350
eveything's filthy.

733
01:12:37,983 --> 01:12:39,918
Eveything's dark and

734
01:12:40,316 --> 01:12:41,383
burned out.

735
01:12:43,249 --> 01:12:45,150
So I hit Send.

736
01:13:02,850 --> 01:13:04,117
You're smoking a lot.

737
01:13:04,716 --> 01:13:06,184
Compared to last time.

738
01:13:08,816 --> 01:13:10,117
I smoked as much then.

739
01:13:19,082 --> 01:13:20,082
I love to smoke.

740
01:13:20,249 --> 01:13:21,817
Smoking a cigarette is like

741
01:13:23,516 --> 01:13:24,483
forgetting.

742
01:13:25,549 --> 01:13:27,717
When I hit rock bottom
it's all I have.

743
01:13:27,883 --> 01:13:30,285
Light up, smoke up,
shut the fuck up.

744
01:13:31,983 --> 01:13:33,284
It hides the shit.

745
01:13:35,650 --> 01:13:37,418
The smoke hides

746
01:13:39,650 --> 01:13:40,984
the shit.

747
01:13:44,650 --> 01:13:46,451
There's menthol and vanilla.

748
01:13:46,783 --> 01:13:48,084
Some people like 'em.

749
01:13:49,316 --> 01:13:50,717
Menthol cigarette.

750
01:13:50,816 --> 01:13:52,217
Vanilla cigarette.

751
01:13:53,049 --> 01:13:54,450
Chocolate cigarette.

752
01:13:55,383 --> 01:13:57,251
Cigarette cigarette.

753
01:14:00,449 --> 01:14:02,184
Cigarettes clearly keep me

754
01:14:03,216 --> 01:14:04,317
from going crazy.

755
01:14:07,016 --> 01:14:08,250
Keeps me alive.

756
01:14:12,950 --> 01:14:14,418
It keeps me alive

757
01:14:14,616 --> 01:14:16,484
until I die.

758
01:14:29,583 --> 01:14:30,550
Are you

759
01:14:31,249 --> 01:14:32,249
all right?

760
01:15:44,283 --> 01:15:45,550
Fint snowfall!

761
01:15:46,816 --> 01:15:47,883
So,

762
01:15:48,249 --> 01:15:51,652
it's been a while since
we saw each other in the county.

763
01:15:52,483 --> 01:15:55,018
And I was wondering,

764
01:15:55,182 --> 01:15:57,751
if there was some misunderstanding,
or awkyardness?

765
01:15:57,916 --> 01:16:00,084
If you were angy or...

766
01:16:00,249 --> 01:16:02,150
You know, about the episode

767
01:16:02,316 --> 01:16:04,918
of our bucolic wrestle.

768
01:16:07,049 --> 01:16:10,919
That's it. Just a little game between
Marie and me.

769
01:16:11,082 --> 01:16:12,249
We're old friends.

770
01:16:12,983 --> 01:16:14,451
I thought of you because

771
01:16:14,616 --> 01:16:17,218
they're showing
My fair Lady on TV.

772
01:16:17,449 --> 01:16:19,951
I saw it in the TV listings.

773
01:16:21,082 --> 01:16:22,616
My Fair Lady's on tonight.

774
01:16:22,783 --> 01:16:26,386
I called cause I thought
it'd be fun to watch.

775
01:16:26,983 --> 01:16:28,884
It'd be fun to watch together.

776
01:16:29,316 --> 01:16:31,251
If you feel like it. Here.

777
01:16:32,449 --> 01:16:33,850
Or at your place or...

778
01:16:34,016 --> 01:16:35,817
Anyway, if you're not busy.

779
01:16:36,850 --> 01:16:37,817
So then...

780
01:18:22,149 --> 01:18:25,185
Yes, this is Nicolas's voin mail.

781
01:18:25,750 --> 01:18:26,851
So leave me a message.

782
01:19:37,216 --> 01:19:41,153
I wait for you in the season
that is ours.

783
01:20:46,483 --> 01:20:48,151
We have to talk.

784
01:20:49,549 --> 01:20:51,751
No, you know, I'm someonewho...

785
01:20:53,616 --> 01:20:54,583
No, I...

786
01:20:54,750 --> 01:20:56,118
I like being with you.

787
01:20:57,449 --> 01:20:58,716
I feel...

788
01:21:00,516 --> 01:21:03,051
I feel good.
Yeah, I like being with you.

789
01:21:04,783 --> 01:21:05,717
OK.

790
01:21:05,883 --> 01:21:06,883
Imagine...

791
01:21:07,716 --> 01:21:08,783
lmagine that

792
01:21:09,149 --> 01:21:11,317
let's say, we have a friend

793
01:21:11,983 --> 01:21:14,385
and he meets a guy.

794
01:21:15,149 --> 01:21:16,884
He meets a nice guy,

795
01:21:17,049 --> 01:21:18,917
funny, charming,

796
01:21:19,950 --> 01:21:21,084
handsome, of course.

797
01:21:21,816 --> 01:21:24,051
He's intelligent. He's...

798
01:21:27,750 --> 01:21:28,984
cultivated.

799
01:21:29,483 --> 01:21:32,152
Vey open-minded.
So much that you go,

800
01:21:32,316 --> 01:21:34,785
"Wow, he's so open-minded!"
You're touched.

801
01:21:35,016 --> 01:21:37,084
That's what seduces you,
touches you.

802
01:21:37,249 --> 01:21:39,851
He touches you.
He's tender and fun.

803
01:21:43,549 --> 01:21:46,752
Let's say you meet this nice guy,
what do you do?

804
01:21:51,316 --> 01:21:52,350
I love you.

805
01:22:00,283 --> 01:22:01,851
I really want to kiss you.

806
01:22:11,149 --> 01:22:13,751
I don't know why
I'm telling you this.

807
01:22:17,549 --> 01:22:18,883
No, it's just that,

808
01:22:19,516 --> 01:22:20,917
it's the end of fall.

809
01:22:21,850 --> 01:22:24,085
I'll have to start heating my place.

810
01:22:24,383 --> 01:22:27,185
And it would be simpler if...

811
01:22:28,383 --> 01:22:29,717
If there were someone.

812
01:22:30,049 --> 01:22:32,050
I'm simpler if there is someone.

813
01:22:39,016 --> 01:22:41,818
And also, I haven't told you
about my marks

814
01:22:41,983 --> 01:22:43,150
like...

815
01:22:46,182 --> 01:22:47,116
Christ!

816
01:22:47,683 --> 01:22:50,085
Robinson Crusoe. I put a ma_ to...

817
01:22:51,216 --> 01:22:52,216
You know, when...

818
01:22:53,683 --> 01:22:55,351
someone tells me, "No, thanks."

819
01:22:55,516 --> 01:22:57,484
"No. Thanks, but I'm not interested."

820
01:22:57,650 --> 01:23:00,986
Whenever that happens
I add another little mark.

821
01:23:01,549 --> 01:23:02,716
But now I'm just

822
01:23:03,650 --> 01:23:07,020
tired of it. They help me
make a clean break.

823
01:23:07,349 --> 01:23:08,616
Know what I mean?

824
01:23:14,016 --> 01:23:15,050
So...

825
01:23:16,583 --> 01:23:17,550
You?

826
01:23:19,016 --> 01:23:19,983
Talk to me.

827
01:23:32,816 --> 01:23:34,884
How could you think I was gay?

828
01:24:31,349 --> 01:24:32,516
Excuse me a sec.

829
01:24:37,016 --> 01:24:37,916
Nico?

830
01:24:45,116 --> 01:24:46,083
Hello!

831
01:24:46,983 --> 01:24:47,950
Hi!

832
01:24:48,516 --> 01:24:49,650
- How are you?
- Good.

833
01:24:49,816 --> 01:24:53,186
I'm been so long. I spotted you.
It's been ages.

834
01:24:53,349 --> 01:24:55,084
Sory, I was completely...

835
01:24:55,249 --> 01:24:57,851
That's OK, it doesn't matter.

836
01:24:57,983 --> 01:24:59,484
We're both busy. It's...

837
01:24:59,716 --> 01:25:02,351
I called once
but didn't leave a message.

838
01:25:02,683 --> 01:25:05,152
Isn't important. But I had a friend.

839
01:25:05,650 --> 01:25:08,085
From Matane.
She'd just got back from a trip.

840
01:25:08,549 --> 01:25:10,517
EURvelyne. And she...

841
01:25:11,249 --> 01:25:13,384
Yeah, she was reading her mail and...

842
01:25:13,983 --> 01:25:16,485
Cause, I'd sent her a letter.

843
01:25:16,850 --> 01:25:19,619
I sent her a letter with an article,

844
01:25:20,283 --> 01:25:22,618
an article by Peter Schlag

845
01:25:22,716 --> 01:25:25,452
in the Boston Observer.
I dunno if you...

846
01:25:25,616 --> 01:25:28,585
I'm a literay review.

847
01:25:28,683 --> 01:25:32,253
It was an article about...

848
01:25:32,416 --> 01:25:36,219
Remains of fascism
in Modern Literature.

849
01:25:37,483 --> 01:25:39,284
I'm amazing!

850
01:25:40,283 --> 01:25:42,518
I'm going on and on.
But what l mean is,

851
01:25:43,016 --> 01:25:46,452
it's to you that l wanted to send

852
01:25:46,650 --> 01:25:48,151
the article.

853
01:25:48,349 --> 01:25:51,418
And to her that l wanted to send...
You got the poem?

854
01:25:51,883 --> 01:25:54,318
I'm to her l wanted to send
the Miron poem.

855
01:25:54,916 --> 01:25:57,718
l sent them the same night.
l mixed up the addresses.

856
01:25:58,650 --> 01:26:01,152
So you ended up with
the poem by Miron.

857
01:26:02,149 --> 01:26:04,684
I could see you reading the poem.

858
01:26:04,783 --> 01:26:07,085
It was pretty heavy but it wasn't

859
01:26:07,283 --> 01:26:09,918
the goal of the exercise.

860
01:26:12,650 --> 01:26:14,318
Your friend,

861
01:26:14,483 --> 01:26:15,617
is she your girlfriend?

862
01:26:15,783 --> 01:26:16,783
Pardon?

863
01:26:16,950 --> 01:26:18,484
The girl,

864
01:26:18,650 --> 01:26:20,618
is she your love_ Your ex? Or...

865
01:26:20,750 --> 01:26:22,351
No, not at all.

866
01:26:22,516 --> 01:26:24,584
No, it wasjust her birthday.

867
01:26:24,716 --> 01:26:27,852
She likes Miron and l thought...
I'd sent her...

868
01:26:28,583 --> 01:26:29,650
the poem.

869
01:26:31,383 --> 01:26:34,419
Soy, l have to run.
l've got something on the stove.

870
01:26:36,216 --> 01:26:37,150
So...

871
01:26:44,349 --> 01:26:46,284
Nico! Nicolas!

872
01:26:54,149 --> 01:26:55,917
What would you say if,

873
01:26:56,616 --> 01:26:58,584
if I'd sent the poem to you?

874
01:27:03,082 --> 01:27:04,149
I'd...

875
01:27:05,349 --> 01:27:07,217
still have something on the stove.

876
01:27:59,983 --> 01:28:00,983
Sory.

877
01:28:17,549 --> 01:28:18,650
Fuck!

878
01:29:47,916 --> 01:29:49,050
I know it was him.

879
01:29:50,182 --> 01:29:52,784
I'll never love anyone else
that much. Tough.

880
01:29:53,316 --> 01:29:54,216
I can handle it.

881
01:29:55,116 --> 01:29:56,484
I know it's usually

882
01:29:57,216 --> 01:29:59,952
later in life that you meet
your soul mate.

883
01:30:00,950 --> 01:30:03,185
Me, too bad. It happened now,

884
01:30:03,349 --> 01:30:04,483
when I'm 25.

885
01:30:05,983 --> 01:30:08,418
I'm not even about sex.
I don't care about sex.

886
01:30:09,516 --> 01:30:10,984
That's not the main thing.

887
01:30:13,349 --> 01:30:14,817
What's important is

888
01:30:15,783 --> 01:30:17,251
to wake up with someone.

889
01:30:18,750 --> 01:30:19,984
To spoon with that penon.

890
01:30:22,883 --> 01:30:24,584
That's what matten, the spoon.

891
01:30:29,249 --> 01:30:30,883
Knowing that if a bad guy comes,

892
01:30:31,516 --> 01:30:32,617
someone's there.

893
01:30:34,416 --> 01:30:36,785
That's a metaphor.
Bad guys never come.

894
01:30:42,182 --> 01:30:43,950
You wake up with the wind,

895
01:30:44,850 --> 01:30:46,918
a warm belly,
the one who loves you

896
01:30:47,082 --> 01:30:48,917
breathing against your shoulder.

897
01:30:51,483 --> 01:30:52,517
That's it,

898
01:30:53,416 --> 01:30:54,350
the spoon.

899
01:30:56,182 --> 01:30:57,283
Yeah.

900
01:30:58,249 --> 01:30:59,483
l must seem...

901
01:31:00,416 --> 01:31:03,385
Ever met a downer like me
or am l the first?

902
01:31:03,516 --> 01:31:06,085
Oh boy!
l've been a hairdresser 20 years,

903
01:31:06,549 --> 01:31:08,617
l've styled single spoons galore.

904
01:31:19,783 --> 01:31:22,519
Hello, francis Riverëkim,

905
01:31:24,283 --> 01:31:26,184
l went shopping at Beverley's

906
01:31:26,416 --> 01:31:28,151
and bought mismatched cups

907
01:31:28,283 --> 01:31:30,251
to serve tea.

908
01:31:30,549 --> 01:31:33,084
So, I don't know if you're free,

909
01:31:33,549 --> 01:31:36,151
but you're invited
for afternoon tea.

910
01:31:36,783 --> 01:31:38,351
So call me back.

911
01:31:38,950 --> 01:31:42,053
Oh, l quit smoking. Call me. Bye.

912
01:31:52,483 --> 01:31:53,584
I'm out of madeleines.

913
01:32:00,650 --> 01:32:01,817
Love your stubble.

914
01:32:02,583 --> 01:32:03,617
Thanks.

915
01:32:04,416 --> 01:32:06,484
You've joined the club of bears?

916
01:32:16,549 --> 01:32:18,284
Here's that armchair.

917
01:32:19,783 --> 01:32:21,184
The armchair l mentioned.

918
01:32:22,916 --> 01:32:23,950
Yeah, right.

919
01:32:29,383 --> 01:32:30,784
Have you seen Nico?

920
01:32:32,916 --> 01:32:33,916
Yes.

921
01:32:34,850 --> 01:32:36,218
l saw him in a bar.

922
01:32:37,182 --> 01:32:38,783
Did you go together?

923
01:32:39,983 --> 01:32:41,617
No, l was having a drink.

924
01:32:41,783 --> 01:32:44,352
He came in with friends.
l just said hi.

925
01:32:50,716 --> 01:32:52,050
He's going toAsia.

926
01:32:53,616 --> 01:32:55,718
- Is he?
- Eight months.

927
01:32:57,683 --> 01:32:58,650
Long time.

928
01:33:07,216 --> 01:33:08,383
Have you seen him?

929
01:33:17,716 --> 01:33:18,650
More tea?

930
01:33:19,449 --> 01:33:20,516
Sure, good idea.

931
01:34:41,449 --> 01:34:45,586
One year later

932
01:35:42,983 --> 01:35:46,753
That repellent Rockabilly looks like
a foetus-eating queen from Gehenna.

933
01:35:50,082 --> 01:35:51,183
Yuck!

934
01:36:13,616 --> 01:36:14,984
I'm really glad...
