2
00:01:35,368 --> 00:01:38,531
She was definitely a turnoff,
too overt.

3
00:01:38,805 --> 00:01:40,466
Look at her--

4
00:01:40,573 --> 00:01:43,509
Obviously, big problems.

5
00:01:43,509 --> 00:01:45,409
Most girls
don't fly through the air...

6
00:01:45,478 --> 00:01:47,878
with their skirt
around their waist.

7
00:01:47,981 --> 00:01:50,973
Supergirl at least had
the decency to wear tights--

8
00:01:51,084 --> 00:01:52,813
not that l read comics.

9
00:01:52,919 --> 00:01:54,784
l'm more the politically,
environmentally correct...

10
00:01:54,887 --> 00:01:57,082
feminist, poetry-reading type.

11
00:01:57,156 --> 00:01:58,680
You know...

12
00:01:58,791 --> 00:02:00,190
boring.

13
00:02:02,462 --> 00:02:05,454
l wonder if she posed
for that painting.

14
00:02:06,499 --> 00:02:08,763
Great perm.

15
00:02:08,868 --> 00:02:10,096
Blond hair--

16
00:02:10,203 --> 00:02:11,830
obvious bleach job.

17
00:02:13,006 --> 00:02:15,236
Too bad it's six months old.

18
00:02:15,341 --> 00:02:17,775
l don't know how she does it.

19
00:02:17,877 --> 00:02:20,402
l get airsick on a seesaw.

20
00:02:24,751 --> 00:02:26,412
l guess she's sort of beautiful.

21
00:02:28,354 --> 00:02:30,447
l don't know. Those lips.

22
00:02:32,558 --> 00:02:34,994
Lips are supposed
to be a perfect reflection...

23
00:02:34,994 --> 00:02:38,259
of another part
of a woman's anatomy.

24
00:02:38,364 --> 00:02:40,889
Not that l'm a lesbian.

25
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,991
Well, maybe l am.

26
00:02:43,936 --> 00:02:45,460
No, definitely not.

27
00:02:45,772 --> 00:02:48,400
l told my mother l was,
just for shock value.

28
00:02:48,508 --> 00:02:51,944
She said, "Fine, just as long
as you don't smoke."

29
00:02:52,045 --> 00:02:54,240
Which, of course,
is my main joy in life.

30
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,712
Probably oral compensation.

31
00:02:56,816 --> 00:02:58,374
l don't think l was breast-fed.

32
00:03:00,353 --> 00:03:03,117
l can't imagine
where she came from.

33
00:03:03,723 --> 00:03:06,851
None of the other kids
at my school are that scangie.

34
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:12,694
l really wish
we could be friends.

35
00:03:30,183 --> 00:03:32,378
A dog got hit! Come on!

36
00:03:51,771 --> 00:03:53,762
Someone should just kill it.

37
00:03:53,906 --> 00:03:55,168
lt's still breathing.

38
00:03:58,077 --> 00:03:59,408
Oh, God.

39
00:04:11,357 --> 00:04:13,086
You kids pipe down!

40
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,428
Principal's office. Please hold.

41
00:04:22,535 --> 00:04:23,866
Take a seat, ma'am.

42
00:04:36,482 --> 00:04:38,347
lt's a stick-on.

43
00:04:39,285 --> 00:04:40,309
See?

44
00:04:41,521 --> 00:04:43,716
l like the ivy.

45
00:04:43,823 --> 00:04:46,883
The cross makes me think
of death, but the ivy is life.

46
00:04:46,993 --> 00:04:50,326
Sort of the tragic
and the hopeful, you know?

47
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:55,326
What did you do to your hair?

48
00:04:55,434 --> 00:04:57,664
lt's Egyptian.

49
00:04:57,804 --> 00:04:59,135
Cool.

50
00:05:01,741 --> 00:05:04,835
What are you busted for?

51
00:05:05,077 --> 00:05:08,672
l got to keep
a certain grade-point average.

52
00:05:08,781 --> 00:05:11,113
l'm slipping in biology.

53
00:05:11,217 --> 00:05:14,311
You're one of those
scholarship kids.

54
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,752
You make it sound
like Jerry's Kids.

55
00:05:16,823 --> 00:05:18,313
lt's not a disease.

56
00:05:18,457 --> 00:05:19,822
Sorry.

57
00:05:20,493 --> 00:05:22,222
Did it hurt?

58
00:05:22,328 --> 00:05:25,786
No. They used a gun.
lt was really Quick.

59
00:05:25,865 --> 00:05:28,857
But you've got this wire
running through your nose.

60
00:05:28,968 --> 00:05:31,129
lt feels like a booger.

61
00:05:31,237 --> 00:05:34,331
Who's the old dude who picks
you up in the pimpmobile?

62
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,875
lt's my dad.

63
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:38,173
He's having a midlife crisis.

64
00:05:38,277 --> 00:05:39,767
My name's Sylvie Cooper.

65
00:05:39,912 --> 00:05:42,210
What did they nail you for?

66
00:05:43,816 --> 00:05:46,114
l phoned in a bomb threat
to KTVM.

67
00:05:48,921 --> 00:05:52,186
You know that lame guy
who does the editorials?

68
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:54,691
He said that teenagers
are too hormonally imbalanced...

69
00:05:54,794 --> 00:05:56,261
to have driver's licenses.

70
00:05:56,362 --> 00:05:58,387
He said the age should be raised
to twenty-one.

71
00:05:58,497 --> 00:06:00,761
How did they know it was you?

72
00:06:00,867 --> 00:06:02,357
Wait a sec.

73
00:06:03,069 --> 00:06:04,798
l've seen your dad.
He is that guy...

74
00:06:04,904 --> 00:06:09,273
that jerk on TV who does
those tweaked editorials.

75
00:06:09,408 --> 00:06:12,468
You phoned in a bomb threat
to your own father?

76
00:06:13,813 --> 00:06:15,815
That's great.

77
00:06:15,815 --> 00:06:17,476
No, l mean it.

78
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,810
l'm gonna break this
to you real slow.

79
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,047
Your dad's an asshole.

80
00:06:36,269 --> 00:06:37,736
l ought to slap you good.

81
00:06:42,441 --> 00:06:45,774
You can't put two hundred people
out on a sidewalk...

82
00:06:45,878 --> 00:06:47,869
just because you
don't like an editorial!

83
00:06:49,982 --> 00:06:52,780
They're trying to get rid of me.
Whose side are you on?

84
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,345
Sylvie, you hurt me.

85
00:06:58,491 --> 00:07:00,789
l didn't mean to.

86
00:07:07,867 --> 00:07:09,801
l'm sorry, Dad.

87
00:07:13,205 --> 00:07:14,695
No more than me.

88
00:07:18,811 --> 00:07:19,835
l.

89
00:07:22,114 --> 00:07:24,309
No more than l.

90
00:07:24,417 --> 00:07:26,385
You're grounded.

91
00:07:31,123 --> 00:07:33,284
You rich fuckhead!

92
00:07:33,359 --> 00:07:34,485
l worked for it!

93
00:07:42,401 --> 00:07:45,427
lt's nice and cool in here.

94
00:07:45,738 --> 00:07:47,103
l missed my ride.

95
00:07:47,239 --> 00:07:49,264
Could you take me
to Olympic and Fairfax?

96
00:07:52,745 --> 00:07:53,712
Just a sec.

97
00:07:55,047 --> 00:07:57,447
She's my best friend.

98
00:07:57,717 --> 00:08:00,083
Why didn't you think
of that before?

99
00:08:00,186 --> 00:08:02,051
Come on.
Just this once, please?

100
00:08:02,154 --> 00:08:04,054
Then l'll be grounded forever.

101
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:06,724
What's her name?

102
00:08:10,329 --> 00:08:12,194
lvy.

103
00:08:12,298 --> 00:08:13,731
Great.

104
00:08:16,869 --> 00:08:18,200
Good Lord.

105
00:08:21,807 --> 00:08:23,138
Get in.

106
00:08:23,242 --> 00:08:27,474
l get carsick.
Do you mind if l sit in front?

107
00:08:28,948 --> 00:08:30,347
Sure.

108
00:08:30,449 --> 00:08:31,711
Thanks.

109
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:38,450
Your name is lvy.

110
00:08:57,243 --> 00:08:59,677
Something wrong with your mouth?

111
00:08:59,745 --> 00:09:02,373
TMJ. lt's stress-related.

112
00:09:02,481 --> 00:09:05,314
lt gives you terrible headaches,
makes your jaw stiff.

113
00:09:05,418 --> 00:09:07,352
Almost killed Burt Reynolds.

114
00:09:07,453 --> 00:09:10,286
Do you have to buy condoms, too?

115
00:09:10,389 --> 00:09:13,359
No, l've got to get a spermicide
with Nonoxynol-Nine in it.

116
00:09:13,359 --> 00:09:14,383
What?

117
00:09:14,493 --> 00:09:17,326
lt's a school project.
This HlV-positive guy...

118
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:20,297
talked about not shooting up
and using condoms.

119
00:09:20,366 --> 00:09:23,335
lt's not like we're supposed
to screw around or anything.

120
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:27,100
We're supposed to learn
to not be embarrassed.

121
00:09:27,206 --> 00:09:29,470
Don't worry. We turn
everything in at the end.

122
00:09:29,742 --> 00:09:31,835
Save the receipts.

123
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:46,451
Shit.

124
00:09:54,934 --> 00:09:57,425
Where have you been?

125
00:09:57,736 --> 00:09:59,067
Grounded.

126
00:10:03,275 --> 00:10:05,106
You lost your boot.

127
00:10:07,513 --> 00:10:09,481
lt's my only pair.

128
00:10:09,748 --> 00:10:10,737
Your turn.

129
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:12,442
No way.

130
00:10:12,551 --> 00:10:13,950
Way.

131
00:10:14,186 --> 00:10:15,710
Forget it.

132
00:10:15,821 --> 00:10:17,288
Are you afraid?

133
00:10:19,024 --> 00:10:21,254
Come on. l won't laugh.

134
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,294
l got to go.

135
00:10:28,968 --> 00:10:31,766
Who cares about
a stupid rope swing anyway?

136
00:10:36,876 --> 00:10:38,776
What's your real name?

137
00:10:38,878 --> 00:10:40,209
l like lvy.

138
00:10:40,312 --> 00:10:42,940
lt sort of gives me the chance
to start over.

139
00:10:48,554 --> 00:10:50,920
lt's so beautiful.

140
00:10:51,924 --> 00:10:53,755
Where did you get it?

141
00:10:53,826 --> 00:10:55,123
From my dad.

142
00:10:59,198 --> 00:11:00,324
He must really love you.

143
00:11:00,432 --> 00:11:03,230
He also feels guilty.

144
00:11:03,335 --> 00:11:04,495
l was adopted.

145
00:11:07,006 --> 00:11:11,102
My biological father was black.
You can tell by my hair.

146
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:13,474
My mom is my real mom...

147
00:11:13,746 --> 00:11:15,771
but when Darryl married her...

148
00:11:15,881 --> 00:11:17,212
he adopted me.

149
00:11:17,316 --> 00:11:19,477
l'm pretty sure
it was to make her happy.

150
00:11:19,752 --> 00:11:22,220
l think
he really cares about you.

151
00:11:22,321 --> 00:11:24,414
My dad didn't want me
anywhere around.

152
00:11:24,523 --> 00:11:27,356
He'd get pissed if you
tried to talk to him.

153
00:11:27,459 --> 00:11:30,360
He'd throw stuff at me,
like food or spitballs.

154
00:11:32,398 --> 00:11:34,161
Your dad read "Hustler"?

155
00:11:34,233 --> 00:11:35,860
l don't think so.

156
00:11:35,968 --> 00:11:38,766
One day l went through his room,
and l found all this stuff.

157
00:11:38,904 --> 00:11:41,236
He had, like,
five hundred magazines...

158
00:11:41,307 --> 00:11:44,834
of the kind with the chicks
and the high heels...

159
00:11:44,977 --> 00:11:49,311
like they look like
they're ready for a...exam.

160
00:11:49,381 --> 00:11:51,042
Sordid. Come on.

161
00:11:52,818 --> 00:11:54,718
l bet that's why
you look so sexy...

162
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,685
so that your dad
would notice you.

163
00:11:56,789 --> 00:11:58,188
Thank you, Doctor.

164
00:11:58,290 --> 00:11:59,723
Did it work?

165
00:12:00,793 --> 00:12:02,351
He left anyway.

166
00:12:04,897 --> 00:12:08,128
l tried to commit suicide once.
See?

167
00:12:08,234 --> 00:12:10,202
-Where?
-There.

168
00:12:10,302 --> 00:12:12,099
Used to be a lot worse.

169
00:12:13,372 --> 00:12:15,340
ls my hair thing covered up?

170
00:12:15,441 --> 00:12:16,908
Yeah. Why?

171
00:12:17,009 --> 00:12:18,704
My parents.

172
00:12:18,777 --> 00:12:21,712
l tried to convince them
it was female pattern balding--

173
00:12:21,814 --> 00:12:24,282
that my hair fell out
in the shape of an eye--

174
00:12:24,383 --> 00:12:26,317
but l don't think
they really bought it.

175
00:12:30,456 --> 00:12:33,914
lt's too big.
You can never find anyone.

176
00:12:38,564 --> 00:12:40,259
How you getting home?

177
00:12:40,366 --> 00:12:41,924
Hitch.

178
00:12:42,034 --> 00:12:44,901
Not everybody gets to go home
in a Mercedes.

179
00:12:45,004 --> 00:12:47,370
Maybe l'll see you around.

180
00:12:51,543 --> 00:12:54,444
l don't really have
many friends.

181
00:12:56,248 --> 00:12:58,113
Me, neither.

182
00:12:58,217 --> 00:13:00,777
Well, yeah, any friends.

183
00:13:00,886 --> 00:13:04,322
Yeah. Everybody hates me.

184
00:13:04,423 --> 00:13:06,789
Everybody hates me, too.

185
00:13:11,163 --> 00:13:12,858
Do you want to come over?

186
00:13:15,301 --> 00:13:17,201
We kind of have to be Quiet.

187
00:13:17,269 --> 00:13:20,329
My mom sleeps a lot.
She's got emphysema.

188
00:13:20,439 --> 00:13:22,373
l think it's to get attention.

189
00:13:22,441 --> 00:13:24,375
She spends her life dying.

190
00:13:26,345 --> 00:13:27,437
Do you got any booze?

191
00:13:27,546 --> 00:13:30,242
No. My dad--glug, glug, glug.

192
00:13:30,316 --> 00:13:32,284
-Fred, Quiet!
-Hiya, puppy.

193
00:13:32,351 --> 00:13:36,310
He really only likes me.
lt's this weird loyalty thing.

194
00:13:36,422 --> 00:13:37,514
You home?

195
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:40,156
Yeah. They canceled.

196
00:13:40,225 --> 00:13:41,283
Head Start.

197
00:13:41,393 --> 00:13:45,329
l teach reading a couple nights
a week to inner city kids.

198
00:13:45,431 --> 00:13:48,264
That's mighty white of you.

199
00:13:48,367 --> 00:13:49,459
Watch it.

200
00:13:53,806 --> 00:13:55,330
This is great.

201
00:14:02,748 --> 00:14:04,113
Sorry.

202
00:14:05,851 --> 00:14:07,375
l like pianos.

203
00:14:10,823 --> 00:14:13,815
lf l was to kill myself,
l'd like to fall--

204
00:14:13,926 --> 00:14:17,896
just close my eyes
and pretend l was flying.

205
00:14:17,896 --> 00:14:20,262
With a big splat at the end.

206
00:14:20,366 --> 00:14:22,129
You wouldn't feel it.

207
00:14:22,234 --> 00:14:25,203
But everybody'd stand around
looking at your insides.

208
00:14:25,337 --> 00:14:29,433
lt's a lot faster
than slashing your wrists.

209
00:14:29,742 --> 00:14:31,369
Who slashed their wrists?

210
00:14:33,746 --> 00:14:36,340
This is my mom Georgie.

211
00:14:36,448 --> 00:14:37,437
Hi there, Georg--

212
00:14:37,549 --> 00:14:39,483
Did she tell you
she slashed her wrists?

213
00:14:42,354 --> 00:14:44,117
Oh, Sylvia.

214
00:14:46,258 --> 00:14:47,384
l'll be right back.

215
00:14:56,402 --> 00:14:58,097
Hand me the Percodan.

216
00:15:05,244 --> 00:15:07,712
You never stop testing, do you?

217
00:15:11,116 --> 00:15:13,277
What kind of girl
is impressed by suicide?

218
00:15:14,486 --> 00:15:15,043
l like her.

219
00:15:15,821 --> 00:15:17,755
She has a hole in her nose.

220
00:15:17,856 --> 00:15:19,448
A lot of girls do.

221
00:15:22,327 --> 00:15:23,453
Leave it open.

222
00:15:24,296 --> 00:15:26,196
lt's supposed to rain tonight.

223
00:15:26,298 --> 00:15:27,822
Then open it wider.

224
00:15:30,335 --> 00:15:31,768
l'd think you'd be embarrassed.

225
00:15:31,904 --> 00:15:32,871
What?

226
00:15:33,005 --> 00:15:35,337
Getting caught lying
all the time.

227
00:15:36,742 --> 00:15:39,074
Did you tell her
you're black, too?

228
00:15:39,211 --> 00:15:42,305
You don't want me
to have any friends, do you?

229
00:15:42,414 --> 00:15:45,281
People you have to lie to
aren't worth your friendship.

230
00:15:46,485 --> 00:15:48,419
When l'm gone...

231
00:15:49,788 --> 00:15:52,882
you can play your music
as loud as you want.

232
00:15:52,991 --> 00:15:54,686
Your dad can turn this room
into a study...

233
00:15:54,793 --> 00:15:56,495
with dead animals on the wall...

234
00:15:56,495 --> 00:15:58,019
but in the meantime...

235
00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:00,121
you are not
hanging out with a girl...

236
00:16:00,232 --> 00:16:03,998
who has a naked woman
with a sword on her back.

237
00:16:04,102 --> 00:16:06,332
What do you think
that says to the boys?

238
00:16:06,438 --> 00:16:08,838
"Try it, buddy,
and l'll cut your dick off"?

239
00:16:12,711 --> 00:16:14,235
l'm causing a problem, right?

240
00:16:15,781 --> 00:16:17,180
-That's OK.
-Wait.

241
00:16:21,854 --> 00:16:24,152
l don't think your mom
wants me here now.

242
00:16:24,256 --> 00:16:25,484
l want you here.

243
00:16:25,757 --> 00:16:28,248
She's sick.
lt makes her act crazy.

244
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,851
She just cares about you.

245
00:16:30,963 --> 00:16:32,726
Maybe l'll see you at school.

246
00:16:35,534 --> 00:16:37,365
Do you go to Oakhurst, too?

247
00:16:37,469 --> 00:16:39,437
Yeah. She has a scholarship.

248
00:16:42,274 --> 00:16:44,742
l know.
l'm kind of out of place there.

249
00:16:44,877 --> 00:16:46,504
l'm always out of place...

250
00:16:47,412 --> 00:16:49,141
especially here.

251
00:16:49,248 --> 00:16:51,216
Your home is really beautiful.

252
00:16:51,316 --> 00:16:55,116
Coop's the first girl l've met
in the city that l can talk to.

253
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,211
She's a good person.

254
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:01,649
lt's blocked.

255
00:17:04,696 --> 00:17:06,095
Where do you live?

256
00:17:06,164 --> 00:17:09,429
My aunt gets money
for letting me stay there.

257
00:17:11,103 --> 00:17:12,434
l get the picture.

258
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,431
Here. Let me.

259
00:17:15,741 --> 00:17:17,038
What are you doing?

260
00:17:21,446 --> 00:17:23,141
lt was too low.

261
00:17:23,248 --> 00:17:24,408
Try it now.

262
00:17:25,851 --> 00:17:27,250
Aren't you afraid?

263
00:17:27,352 --> 00:17:28,410
Of what?

264
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:32,221
Catching death.

265
00:17:32,324 --> 00:17:33,882
Oh, Mom.

266
00:17:35,427 --> 00:17:36,826
Energy never dies.

267
00:17:36,929 --> 00:17:38,419
lt just changes form.

268
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:42,261
You see if you're ready
to change form...

269
00:17:42,367 --> 00:17:44,062
when you're
thirty-eight years old.

270
00:17:47,873 --> 00:17:51,172
Well, my mom died
in her forties...

271
00:17:51,276 --> 00:17:52,937
but she was dead
way before that.

272
00:17:53,178 --> 00:17:55,703
She only pretended to be alive.

273
00:17:56,715 --> 00:18:01,709
She was coked out all the time,
looking out windows.

274
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:05,085
Every shadow was a cop
or a dealer she owed.

275
00:18:06,391 --> 00:18:09,155
She was always asking
if l heard noises.

276
00:18:12,264 --> 00:18:15,199
And she flinched
every time l touched her.

277
00:18:16,802 --> 00:18:18,463
Even for a hug.

278
00:18:33,218 --> 00:18:36,210
l bet you drove it with
the top down even in the rain.

279
00:18:37,856 --> 00:18:39,050
Best time.

280
00:18:43,462 --> 00:18:48,195
l hope that when l die
l'll have owned a sports car...

281
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,461
had a family...

282
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:53,164
a home.

283
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:59,101
Mom died an old lady who never
did anything with the top down.

284
00:19:03,148 --> 00:19:07,084
One day with the top down is
better than a lifetime in a box.

285
00:19:13,492 --> 00:19:15,392
Groucho said he wouldn't
belong to any club...

286
00:19:15,494 --> 00:19:17,223
that would have him as a member.

287
00:19:17,329 --> 00:19:20,196
l know what he meant,
but with lvy it was different.

288
00:19:20,298 --> 00:19:22,391
Her acceptance didn't make me
think less of her.

289
00:19:23,268 --> 00:19:25,293
lt made me think more of me.

290
00:19:25,404 --> 00:19:28,237
At first,
we wandered around, shopped.

291
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:31,241
We developed an unspoken
division of labor--

292
00:19:31,343 --> 00:19:33,777
she bought, l paid.

293
00:19:33,879 --> 00:19:36,848
l got my first skintight
red leather miniskirt.

294
00:19:37,115 --> 00:19:38,480
Of course, it wasn't for me.

295
00:19:44,289 --> 00:19:47,349
Over the next couple of weeks,
lvy sort of moved in.

296
00:19:47,459 --> 00:19:49,086
No one seemed to mind.

297
00:19:49,194 --> 00:19:51,754
My parents just got used
to having her around.

298
00:19:51,863 --> 00:19:53,797
lvy's aunt was in heaven.

299
00:19:53,932 --> 00:19:56,730
She kept the money, we kept lvy.

300
00:20:03,408 --> 00:20:05,273
Mom really liked her.

301
00:20:05,377 --> 00:20:08,437
l think lvy's energy
was good for her.

302
00:20:08,547 --> 00:20:10,916
lt's true what Mom said.

303
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:14,408
A lot of people think
death is contagious.

304
00:20:14,486 --> 00:20:16,386
lvy's different.

305
00:20:16,488 --> 00:20:18,285
Pretty phenomenal, really.

306
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:21,951
l mean, l never knew anyone that
looked that much like a slut.

307
00:20:22,227 --> 00:20:23,990
Here she was--
my best friend.

308
00:20:32,037 --> 00:20:34,904
l didn't really try
to slash my wrists.

309
00:20:34,973 --> 00:20:36,907
l was trying to go outside,
and--

310
00:20:38,009 --> 00:20:40,978
-lt's OK.
-l ran through the glass door.

311
00:20:47,586 --> 00:20:50,987
And Darryl is your real father,
isn't he?

312
00:20:51,089 --> 00:20:52,488
l'm afraid so.

313
00:20:53,992 --> 00:20:55,823
You look more like him.

314
00:20:56,962 --> 00:20:58,259
No offense.

315
00:20:59,798 --> 00:21:00,822
None taken.

316
00:21:10,442 --> 00:21:12,342
My mom's pretty, huh?

317
00:21:41,439 --> 00:21:42,872
Rare, huh?

318
00:21:45,844 --> 00:21:47,243
Pardon?

319
00:21:47,412 --> 00:21:49,039
lt's so clear.

320
00:21:49,881 --> 00:21:52,543
l'm freezing my ass off.

321
00:21:52,818 --> 00:21:54,342
Want me to get a jacket for you?

322
00:21:55,487 --> 00:21:56,681
A sweater?

323
00:21:59,758 --> 00:22:01,350
l hear you're having a party.

324
00:22:01,459 --> 00:22:02,790
lt's just business.

325
00:22:04,329 --> 00:22:06,194
Coop told me.

326
00:22:06,298 --> 00:22:10,166
She's looking forward to proving
how hormonally balanced she is.

327
00:22:10,235 --> 00:22:12,203
What are you going to do?

328
00:22:14,406 --> 00:22:17,807
l don't have time
to paint them over.

329
00:22:18,877 --> 00:22:20,777
Don't worry. l'll get lost.

330
00:22:23,181 --> 00:22:24,910
Can you hand me my boots?

331
00:22:27,219 --> 00:22:28,481
Sure.

332
00:22:36,761 --> 00:22:38,991
Those cost
a hundred and fifty bucks.

333
00:22:41,066 --> 00:22:42,397
Hundred and fifty?

334
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,530
That ought to do it.

335
00:23:03,488 --> 00:23:05,149
You keep the change.

336
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:27,877
No. Coop's not here.
This is her friend.

337
00:23:27,946 --> 00:23:29,937
Jim from Head Start?

338
00:23:30,181 --> 00:23:32,342
l really admire
your guys' dedication.

339
00:23:33,985 --> 00:23:35,418
Wait, l'll check.

340
00:23:40,358 --> 00:23:42,155
The sixteenth?

341
00:23:42,227 --> 00:23:43,421
Yeah, she's free.

342
00:23:43,528 --> 00:23:44,722
No problem.

343
00:23:46,564 --> 00:23:48,532
Great. l'll tell her.

344
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,428
l'm writing it down
on her calendar right now.

345
00:23:53,004 --> 00:23:55,370
'Twist on one half-turn."

346
00:23:55,507 --> 00:23:56,667
More.

347
00:23:57,742 --> 00:23:59,471
l'm following directions.

348
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:02,440
Dad, l noticed the Percodan
was out of Mom's room.

349
00:24:20,365 --> 00:24:21,696
Got any instant?

350
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,860
Espresso.
Dark bean, healthy bean.

351
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:28,906
So what's next, you confiscate
her shoelaces and belt?

352
00:24:29,174 --> 00:24:31,165
l want my pills back.

353
00:24:31,276 --> 00:24:33,767
Now!

354
00:24:33,912 --> 00:24:35,777
l'll get you one, honey.

355
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,814
l want the goddamn bottle.
They're mine.

356
00:24:37,916 --> 00:24:40,441
lsabelle!

357
00:24:41,486 --> 00:24:43,147
Turn it off.

358
00:24:46,758 --> 00:24:47,884
Mom, he's only trying--

359
00:24:47,993 --> 00:24:50,826
lf l wanted to kill myself,
he couldn't stop me.

360
00:24:54,499 --> 00:24:57,764
lvy, would you take me
to my room, please?

361
00:25:15,153 --> 00:25:17,451
l'm sorry.

362
00:25:21,459 --> 00:25:24,326
l don't want to go
to school today.

363
00:25:24,396 --> 00:25:27,365
Let's do something
that'll make my parents cringe.

364
00:25:31,503 --> 00:25:33,164
Come on.

365
00:25:39,477 --> 00:25:41,308
You sure you're twenty-one now?

366
00:25:43,481 --> 00:25:44,914
Twenty-two.

367
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:47,850
And how old's your friend?

368
00:25:47,952 --> 00:25:49,476
Thirty.

369
00:25:50,522 --> 00:25:52,820
God damn, you ladies look fine.

370
00:25:54,426 --> 00:25:56,291
Could we change the music?

371
00:25:58,463 --> 00:26:00,192
lt helps me concentrate.

372
00:26:00,298 --> 00:26:01,788
Let him concentrate.

373
00:26:02,033 --> 00:26:04,001
Yeah, 'cause you're next, honey.

374
00:26:04,069 --> 00:26:05,331
No, thank you.

375
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:07,461
Come on.

376
00:26:07,772 --> 00:26:09,774
How about a little penis...

377
00:26:09,774 --> 00:26:13,141
that says down the shaft,
"plan ahead"?

378
00:26:16,514 --> 00:26:18,709
Why does the penis
have to be so little?

379
00:26:18,817 --> 00:26:20,751
lt's one of my hottest sellers.

380
00:26:21,352 --> 00:26:24,253
Usually the ladies like 'em
between their breasts.

381
00:26:27,125 --> 00:26:29,218
You sure that's sterile?

382
00:26:30,228 --> 00:26:31,490
You bet.

383
00:26:36,234 --> 00:26:38,702
Come on.
How about an artsy one?

384
00:26:38,803 --> 00:26:42,762
lt would be like we're sisters,
like blood sisters.

385
00:26:42,907 --> 00:26:45,432
lf the infection didn't kill me,
my dad would.

386
00:26:45,543 --> 00:26:49,411
l thought you said you were
thirty. What's happening?

387
00:26:49,514 --> 00:26:52,415
She's having a little problem
leaving home.

388
00:26:52,484 --> 00:26:55,715
What's more important,
death or friendship?

389
00:26:55,787 --> 00:26:57,152
Please.

390
00:26:57,255 --> 00:26:59,746
l'm just not the type.

391
00:26:59,824 --> 00:27:01,689
What's that supposed to mean?

392
00:27:02,827 --> 00:27:04,158
Nothing.

393
00:27:04,262 --> 00:27:07,698
But l am? Low-class?

394
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:09,767
You rich little bitch...

395
00:27:09,868 --> 00:27:12,302
with your socially
acceptable rebellion.

396
00:27:13,338 --> 00:27:17,274
What am l, just another one of
your inner city charity cases?

397
00:27:17,408 --> 00:27:20,673
-l'm so sorry.
-What?

398
00:27:20,745 --> 00:27:22,713
That you don't have
to teach me to read.

399
00:27:22,814 --> 00:27:24,441
Must break your heart.

400
00:27:25,717 --> 00:27:27,480
Fuck you.

401
00:27:30,188 --> 00:27:32,247
You know what?
You don't have any class.

402
00:27:34,459 --> 00:27:36,893
As a matter of fact,
you look like a slut.

403
00:27:38,129 --> 00:27:39,824
Coop, wait.

404
00:27:44,169 --> 00:27:46,296
l need forty bucks
to pay this guy.

405
00:27:46,404 --> 00:27:47,803
l don't have any money.

406
00:27:47,906 --> 00:27:51,808
Why don't you suck his dick?
Maybe he'll give you a deal.

407
00:27:56,481 --> 00:27:58,745
Take American Express?

408
00:28:11,296 --> 00:28:12,957
l don't think she's thirty.

409
00:28:13,064 --> 00:28:16,158
Shut up.

410
00:28:23,775 --> 00:28:26,039
One of those bills is a hundred.

411
00:28:29,247 --> 00:28:30,271
This one?

412
00:28:30,381 --> 00:28:32,178
Yeah. l need it back.

413
00:28:51,536 --> 00:28:53,231
l'm sorry.

414
00:28:54,339 --> 00:28:55,431
What about?

415
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,105
l'm the asshole.

416
00:28:57,242 --> 00:28:59,676
But you're still my best friend.

417
00:29:01,145 --> 00:29:02,942
Till death.

418
00:29:05,016 --> 00:29:07,382
That's beautiful.

419
00:29:07,452 --> 00:29:08,942
Get away.

420
00:29:09,354 --> 00:29:10,719
Oh, my God.

421
00:29:18,329 --> 00:29:19,694
Where's the fucking bus?

422
00:29:19,797 --> 00:29:23,130
l don't need no fucking bus.

423
00:29:23,234 --> 00:29:25,168
l don't need no Mercedes.

424
00:29:25,236 --> 00:29:27,727
l'm in charge of my own fate.

425
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:30,672
Get the hell off the street!

426
00:29:33,344 --> 00:29:36,211
Because the only people
safe there are the drug dealers.

427
00:29:36,281 --> 00:29:37,515
Cosmic.

428
00:29:37,515 --> 00:29:39,449
Fuck, let's get out of here.

429
00:29:39,717 --> 00:29:43,483
They have more firepower
than the police department.

430
00:29:43,755 --> 00:29:45,484
-Where are you going?
-Home.

431
00:29:45,757 --> 00:29:47,452
Come on.

432
00:29:47,525 --> 00:29:48,822
Carsick.

433
00:29:48,926 --> 00:29:50,086
Thank you.

434
00:29:50,194 --> 00:29:52,196
l'll tell you one thing--

435
00:29:52,196 --> 00:29:54,460
the kids are learning
the metric system here--

436
00:29:54,532 --> 00:29:56,466
kilos, grams,
that sort of thing.

437
00:29:56,734 --> 00:29:59,862
We're in jail, and we've
put ourselves in jail...

438
00:30:00,004 --> 00:30:02,370
while the people
who should be behind bars...

439
00:30:02,473 --> 00:30:04,270
are free on the streets.

440
00:30:04,375 --> 00:30:06,809
This has been
a piece of my mind.

441
00:30:06,911 --> 00:30:08,401
l'm Darryl Cooper...

442
00:30:08,513 --> 00:30:11,107
general manager of KTVM.
Thank you.

443
00:30:11,215 --> 00:30:13,410
And we're clear.

444
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:24,853
Can l get a juice,
a couple of aspirin?

445
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:54,854
l always seem to be
looking at life...

446
00:30:54,959 --> 00:30:57,792
from the wrong side
of the window.

447
00:31:14,912 --> 00:31:18,211
Maybe l should bleach my hair,
change my life, you know?

448
00:31:18,316 --> 00:31:19,908
Platinum.

449
00:31:19,984 --> 00:31:23,283
l think you'd look
like a little scangie ho.

450
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:27,748
l'm a geek.

451
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,852
You're beautiful.

452
00:31:30,962 --> 00:31:32,395
Really?

453
00:31:33,965 --> 00:31:35,398
l promise.

454
00:31:37,435 --> 00:31:38,800
Do you think
l'll ever have big tits?

455
00:31:38,903 --> 00:31:42,202
Girls with curly hair usually
have big tits, don't they?

456
00:31:42,306 --> 00:31:44,831
Late bloomers
always turn out best anyhow.

457
00:31:44,976 --> 00:31:48,036
Don't patronize me, lvy.

458
00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:49,906
l'm not patronizing you.

459
00:31:50,014 --> 00:31:51,914
l'm loving you.

460
00:31:53,951 --> 00:31:56,249
You love me?

461
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:00,221
l love you.

462
00:32:00,324 --> 00:32:03,293
l love you, too.

463
00:32:15,907 --> 00:32:17,841
Let's go.

464
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:39,821
The FBl is gonna forget
about the bomb threat.

465
00:32:39,931 --> 00:32:41,398
They figured it was some kid.

466
00:32:41,499 --> 00:32:43,364
Nobody knows whose.

467
00:32:46,537 --> 00:32:48,402
Do l look older?

468
00:32:53,311 --> 00:32:54,141
What?

469
00:32:56,247 --> 00:32:57,373
This is...

470
00:33:00,117 --> 00:33:02,745
all l have.
l can't start over.

471
00:33:05,223 --> 00:33:08,249
You must own half
the Valley by now.

472
00:33:08,326 --> 00:33:10,260
Why do you need a job?

473
00:33:10,361 --> 00:33:12,124
ls this party going to help?

474
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:15,256
They're going to eat your food,
drink your booze...

475
00:33:15,366 --> 00:33:18,369
and do whatever
they already decided to.

476
00:33:18,369 --> 00:33:21,065
What's really bothering you?

477
00:33:27,845 --> 00:33:29,107
Try it.

478
00:33:30,314 --> 00:33:31,872
Say something.

479
00:33:38,222 --> 00:33:41,385
She promised
she'd never leave me.

480
00:33:43,995 --> 00:33:47,487
Now she can barely breathe
enough to say l love you.

481
00:33:51,903 --> 00:33:53,768
What am l without her?

482
00:34:34,445 --> 00:34:37,481
What were you doing up there?

483
00:34:37,481 --> 00:34:38,505
Nothing.

484
00:34:40,217 --> 00:34:42,447
Just leave me alone.

485
00:35:08,879 --> 00:35:10,039
What?

486
00:35:13,384 --> 00:35:15,045
Nothing.

487
00:35:17,288 --> 00:35:18,721
Honey.

488
00:35:24,895 --> 00:35:28,296
Can't l, like--l mean...

489
00:35:28,399 --> 00:35:31,802
lsn't there anything
that l can do...

490
00:35:31,802 --> 00:35:35,135
like anything
to make you feel better?

491
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:36,228
Why?

492
00:35:37,441 --> 00:35:40,444
Because l have a blank spot
in my schedule.

493
00:35:40,444 --> 00:35:41,775
What do you think?

494
00:35:41,879 --> 00:35:44,814
l feel bad all the time,
and l don't know what to do.

495
00:35:50,021 --> 00:35:51,818
Do you believe in God?

496
00:35:54,291 --> 00:35:56,316
l'm tired, OK?

497
00:35:57,828 --> 00:36:01,286
Yeah, well, you know,
l'd like to know.

498
00:36:01,399 --> 00:36:03,458
-Not now.
-When?

499
00:36:03,734 --> 00:36:04,996
Please.

500
00:36:07,338 --> 00:36:10,796
You're sick, and you don't know
what you believe?

501
00:36:12,476 --> 00:36:14,808
l know l feel like shit.

502
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,779
l know that the idea...

503
00:36:17,882 --> 00:36:21,181
of taking a breath without pain
sounds like heaven...

504
00:36:21,285 --> 00:36:24,049
and when you're dead,
you don't breathe...

505
00:36:24,155 --> 00:36:25,179
so...

506
00:36:27,491 --> 00:36:29,721
l'm just tired.

507
00:36:39,136 --> 00:36:41,331
Oh, my God, someone's early.
Tell Dad.

508
00:36:43,741 --> 00:36:45,106
James.

509
00:36:47,211 --> 00:36:49,406
Well, who died?

510
00:36:49,513 --> 00:36:51,310
-What are you doing?
-Put some pants on.

511
00:36:51,415 --> 00:36:52,939
l got a van full of kids.

512
00:36:53,217 --> 00:36:55,685
Most don't need the keys
to get it started. Let's go!

513
00:36:55,753 --> 00:36:58,381
l'm helping my dad
with his party.

514
00:36:58,456 --> 00:37:00,151
Oh, my God.

515
00:37:00,257 --> 00:37:03,124
l must have gotten
the days mixed up.

516
00:37:03,227 --> 00:37:05,252
l said you could go.

517
00:37:05,362 --> 00:37:07,694
Thirty seconds,
and the van's history.

518
00:37:07,798 --> 00:37:08,787
We got to go.

519
00:37:09,033 --> 00:37:10,091
What's going on here?

520
00:37:10,201 --> 00:37:12,294
-Hi, Mr. Cooper.
-Hi, James.

521
00:37:12,403 --> 00:37:15,133
-What's this?
-What's it going to be?

522
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:17,207
You knew.
How could you do this?

523
00:37:17,308 --> 00:37:18,366
l don't know.

524
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:25,214
l was counting on her help here.

525
00:37:25,282 --> 00:37:27,216
l promised my dad.

526
00:37:29,754 --> 00:37:31,415
Great.

527
00:37:31,489 --> 00:37:34,481
She's the reason
those kids are even in school.

528
00:37:34,759 --> 00:37:37,057
lf she doesn't show up,
why should they?

529
00:37:37,161 --> 00:37:38,185
Well?

530
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:42,192
Maybe l could help.

531
00:37:42,299 --> 00:37:45,268
l think l can handle
taking people's coats...

532
00:37:45,369 --> 00:37:47,496
and showing them
where the bathroom is.

533
00:37:48,773 --> 00:37:50,707
Please. l feel so stupid.

534
00:37:50,775 --> 00:37:52,174
Let me make it up.

535
00:37:53,711 --> 00:37:55,303
l'll wear something nice.

536
00:37:55,379 --> 00:37:56,710
You'll love me.

537
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:00,376
Sounds good.

538
00:38:08,259 --> 00:38:10,193
Dad, what should l do?

539
00:38:11,362 --> 00:38:12,693
Go ahead, honey.

540
00:38:12,797 --> 00:38:14,196
We'll figure it out.

541
00:38:21,372 --> 00:38:23,774
Yeah. That's right. Bob.

542
00:38:23,774 --> 00:38:26,334
l spell it backwards--B-O-B.

543
00:38:28,512 --> 00:38:30,844
God,
l hope they serve dinner soon.

544
00:38:30,948 --> 00:38:33,849
Who cares?
l feel guilty eating his food.

545
00:38:33,951 --> 00:38:36,249
Who's going to tell him?

546
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,083
l thought his kid
had dark hair.

547
00:38:38,189 --> 00:38:39,349
Must be a caterer.

548
00:38:39,456 --> 00:38:41,856
l wonder if Georgie
will make an appearance.

549
00:38:41,959 --> 00:38:43,859
Think she will?
l heard she's getting worse.

550
00:38:43,961 --> 00:38:45,861
You can cater my party anytime.

551
00:38:45,963 --> 00:38:47,260
Max, behave yourself.

552
00:38:47,364 --> 00:38:49,264
My fingers never left my hand.

553
00:38:49,366 --> 00:38:50,492
His wife, remember?

554
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:55,665
Hello, Mr. Cooper.

555
00:38:58,776 --> 00:39:01,006
Care for anything?

556
00:39:03,414 --> 00:39:07,145
That...dress fits you perfectly.

557
00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:10,277
You look...

558
00:39:10,387 --> 00:39:12,116
Beautiful?

559
00:39:13,224 --> 00:39:15,124
Something like that, yeah.

560
00:39:22,132 --> 00:39:24,157
l almost forgot.

561
00:39:24,268 --> 00:39:26,293
You're not allowed.

562
00:39:27,705 --> 00:39:28,797
l'm not an alcoholic.

563
00:39:28,906 --> 00:39:31,101
l used to have
a drinking problem...

564
00:39:31,208 --> 00:39:33,108
but since l don't drink
anymore...

565
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:34,700
this is OK.

566
00:42:18,275 --> 00:42:20,800
Honey,
l'm glad you're awake. l...

567
00:42:20,944 --> 00:42:22,502
You look nice.

568
00:42:25,182 --> 00:42:26,945
How stupid of me.

569
00:42:28,419 --> 00:42:30,717
What a dumb,
sick jerk l've been.

570
00:42:30,821 --> 00:42:32,311
Honey, Quiet. There's--

571
00:42:32,423 --> 00:42:35,256
Which party are you
afraid of me ruining?

572
00:42:37,494 --> 00:42:39,519
Everybody's gone home.

573
00:43:01,852 --> 00:43:06,289
l was so happy that Sylvie
had found a...little friend.

574
00:43:11,862 --> 00:43:13,227
Honey.

575
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:15,355
Get away from me.

576
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:22,370
l thought you both
could use this.

577
00:43:24,374 --> 00:43:26,205
Get out.

578
00:43:27,377 --> 00:43:29,174
l feel so stupid.

579
00:43:30,481 --> 00:43:32,483
l shouldn't have
worn your clothes.

580
00:43:32,483 --> 00:43:36,943
Everybody said l look like you,
and he misses you so much.

581
00:43:39,256 --> 00:43:41,952
l think he came
into the kitchen to cry.

582
00:43:43,994 --> 00:43:48,454
And l saw him,
and l put my arms around him.

583
00:43:52,436 --> 00:43:54,063
lt seemed right.

584
00:43:55,772 --> 00:43:56,864
l'm sorry.

585
00:44:05,816 --> 00:44:07,215
lt's OK.

586
00:44:14,324 --> 00:44:16,485
He doesn't drink.

587
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:17,784
Right.

588
00:44:33,810 --> 00:44:35,710
l'm sorry.

589
00:48:33,784 --> 00:48:35,479
Fred?

590
00:48:48,799 --> 00:48:50,426
Wild party.

591
00:49:21,331 --> 00:49:24,300
l know it's stupid
to be jealous about a dog.

592
00:49:24,401 --> 00:49:26,699
lt's probably because
l have low self-esteem.

593
00:49:26,837 --> 00:49:30,170
The fact that Fred hated
every human except me...

594
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:32,001
really meant something.

595
00:49:36,413 --> 00:49:39,746
My father never gave me
anything real.

596
00:49:45,422 --> 00:49:49,483
l guess you give up things
when you take on a friendship.

597
00:49:53,497 --> 00:49:55,192
Come on, Fred.

598
00:49:56,533 --> 00:49:59,502
l know you want some
of my special treats.

599
00:50:04,207 --> 00:50:06,402
No one else gives you any,
do they?

600
00:50:11,314 --> 00:50:13,908
You love me, don't you?

601
00:52:01,758 --> 00:52:03,248
Did it work?

602
00:52:04,828 --> 00:52:06,853
What?

603
00:52:06,963 --> 00:52:08,260
The party.

604
00:52:09,366 --> 00:52:12,199
Let me tell you about parties.

605
00:52:13,937 --> 00:52:16,201
People eat your food,
drink your booze...

606
00:52:16,306 --> 00:52:18,331
and do what they're
gonna do anyway.

607
00:52:19,542 --> 00:52:21,203
Have you seen Fred?

608
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:33,152
l better get to school.

609
00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:41,527
Jesus.

610
00:52:51,808 --> 00:52:54,242
What the hell are you doing
in my mom's car?

611
00:52:54,344 --> 00:52:56,244
l found the key.

612
00:52:57,881 --> 00:53:00,748
lt's not yours. Get out.

613
00:53:00,817 --> 00:53:02,842
l wasn't doing anything.

614
00:53:02,952 --> 00:53:05,785
And leave my goddamn dog alone.

615
00:53:05,889 --> 00:53:07,049
You're kidding.

616
00:53:07,157 --> 00:53:10,251
All my mom's stuff
seems to fit you fine.

617
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:11,691
l didn't steal anything.

618
00:53:11,795 --> 00:53:14,093
She said l could
borrow some stuff.

619
00:53:14,197 --> 00:53:17,098
You're not my friend,
and my dog's a traitor.

620
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:18,690
That's not true.

621
00:53:18,802 --> 00:53:20,236
Really?

622
00:53:20,236 --> 00:53:22,727
Suddenly he seems to think
that he's yours.

623
00:53:22,872 --> 00:53:24,169
Bullshit.

624
00:53:24,274 --> 00:53:26,174
Let's find out.
Stand over there.

625
00:53:26,276 --> 00:53:28,210
You know what this is?

626
00:53:28,311 --> 00:53:30,779
Fuck you with a limp dick!

627
00:53:31,548 --> 00:53:34,346
Do it. Go! Do it!

628
00:53:35,485 --> 00:53:38,386
-God, this is so stupid.
-Call him.

629
00:53:42,892 --> 00:53:44,154
Do it!

630
00:53:45,361 --> 00:53:46,453
Here, boy.

631
00:53:54,070 --> 00:53:55,332
Go ahead. Keep calling him.

632
00:54:01,478 --> 00:54:03,708
God damn it, Fred.
l called you.

633
00:54:06,116 --> 00:54:07,413
Fred, come here.

634
00:54:09,185 --> 00:54:10,743
No, Fred. Come here.

635
00:54:12,489 --> 00:54:15,322
No, Fred. Come here.

636
00:54:15,425 --> 00:54:17,188
Fred, l called you.

637
00:54:18,394 --> 00:54:19,827
Come here, Fred.

638
00:54:24,367 --> 00:54:26,232
Fred,
get your fuzzy ass over here.

639
00:54:31,975 --> 00:54:33,738
That's a good boy.

640
00:54:35,912 --> 00:54:37,243
Fuck you, Fred.

641
00:54:42,485 --> 00:54:46,285
Here. Here's something
your mother didn't loan me.

642
00:56:28,191 --> 00:56:30,455
l...got off work early.

643
00:56:30,727 --> 00:56:35,755
l figured, what the hell,
give the girls a ride.

644
00:56:35,865 --> 00:56:37,298
Coop's not here.

645
00:56:41,771 --> 00:56:43,864
You want a ride?

646
00:56:44,007 --> 00:56:47,306
Look, Darryl,
just give my books a ride home.

647
00:56:47,410 --> 00:56:48,843
l feel like walking.

648
00:56:57,186 --> 00:56:58,210
Get in.

649
00:57:07,163 --> 00:57:08,391
You're not my father.

650
00:57:09,832 --> 00:57:11,265
That's right. l'm not.

651
00:57:27,717 --> 00:57:30,379
l just can't...

652
00:57:30,486 --> 00:57:32,784
You already did.

653
00:57:32,889 --> 00:57:35,050
Remember last night?

654
00:57:39,362 --> 00:57:41,057
l can stop.

655
00:57:43,166 --> 00:57:46,067
How about right here?

656
00:57:46,169 --> 00:57:47,466
Stop.

657
00:57:50,773 --> 00:57:51,899
Get out.

658
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:58,707
You heard me.

659
00:58:00,450 --> 00:58:02,384
l hurt you?

660
00:58:02,452 --> 00:58:05,319
Heard me.

661
00:58:10,026 --> 00:58:12,085
l thought you said "hurt me."

662
00:58:12,195 --> 00:58:13,423
l didn't.

663
00:58:23,439 --> 00:58:25,304
Did l hurt you?

664
00:58:29,879 --> 00:58:31,369
l can handle this.

665
01:02:30,753 --> 01:02:33,722
You have a key.

666
01:02:34,924 --> 01:02:37,484
l didn't know
if l should use it.

667
01:02:47,370 --> 01:02:49,463
l'm really sorry about your dog.

668
01:02:52,008 --> 01:02:53,999
l've never had one...

669
01:02:54,110 --> 01:02:56,704
and it was sort of fun
pretending he was mine.

670
01:03:00,283 --> 01:03:02,251
He likes you best.

671
01:03:08,324 --> 01:03:11,225
l'm sorry.
lt won't ever happen again.

672
01:03:23,406 --> 01:03:26,375
By the way, what was that record
you were playing?

673
01:03:26,509 --> 01:03:28,909
Don't overdo it.

674
01:04:16,258 --> 01:04:19,193
You think about it sometimes,
don't you?

675
01:04:20,896 --> 01:04:22,124
Sometimes.

676
01:04:55,831 --> 01:04:57,093
Mom?

677
01:06:03,399 --> 01:06:06,800
l never thought my mom
would really do it.

678
01:06:06,869 --> 01:06:09,269
She threatened,
but l didn't believe her.

679
01:06:10,239 --> 01:06:12,366
She must have really hurt.

680
01:06:18,514 --> 01:06:21,881
When she first got sick,
l thought she was faking.

681
01:06:23,385 --> 01:06:25,148
l was embarrassed by her.

682
01:06:26,322 --> 01:06:27,789
lt made me angry.

683
01:06:28,324 --> 01:06:31,316
This little oxygen bottle
she carried with her--

684
01:06:31,427 --> 01:06:34,726
We'd be at the supermarket,
and she'd pull it out.

685
01:06:34,830 --> 01:06:38,391
Hiss, suck...hiss, suck...

686
01:06:38,501 --> 01:06:40,435
l wanted to kill her.

687
01:06:41,871 --> 01:06:44,431
Maybe if l
hadn't been so selfish...

688
01:06:45,474 --> 01:06:48,375
maybe if l could have
told her l loved her...

689
01:06:49,912 --> 01:06:52,904
maybe things
would be different now.

690
01:07:37,426 --> 01:07:38,825
Leave it open.

691
01:07:42,431 --> 01:07:43,728
The door.

692
01:07:43,832 --> 01:07:45,231
Leave it open.

693
01:07:50,873 --> 01:07:53,671
You're in my mother's bed.

694
01:07:55,044 --> 01:07:57,706
You looked like you
needed to be alone.

695
01:08:01,016 --> 01:08:02,210
Come here.

696
01:08:06,055 --> 01:08:07,989
Come here. lt's OK.

697
01:08:24,807 --> 01:08:26,331
Talk to me.

698
01:08:26,475 --> 01:08:28,067
This is weird.

699
01:08:31,780 --> 01:08:35,181
l wanted to talk to her,
you know?

700
01:08:35,284 --> 01:08:38,720
Tell her stuff before she died.

701
01:08:38,821 --> 01:08:40,220
Tell me.

702
01:08:41,323 --> 01:08:42,415
What?

703
01:08:42,524 --> 01:08:44,822
Pretend l'm her.

704
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:48,226
Come on. l'm your mom.

705
01:08:48,330 --> 01:08:50,127
l don't know what to say.

706
01:08:50,199 --> 01:08:52,793
What couldn't you say to me?

707
01:08:52,901 --> 01:08:54,095
Come on. l'm Georgie.

708
01:08:57,840 --> 01:08:59,967
l was jealous of you.

709
01:09:01,210 --> 01:09:05,977
When you walked into a room,
people shut up and stared.

710
01:09:11,687 --> 01:09:14,451
l was glad when you got sick.

711
01:09:16,759 --> 01:09:20,422
l thought l would
finally have my turn...

712
01:09:20,496 --> 01:09:22,259
but l was wrong.

713
01:09:25,701 --> 01:09:27,293
Everything was for you.

714
01:09:27,369 --> 01:09:29,837
There was nothing left for me.

715
01:09:31,774 --> 01:09:33,799
l don't buy it, Sylvie.

716
01:09:33,909 --> 01:09:36,707
You were never afraid
to get angry at me.

717
01:09:36,779 --> 01:09:39,213
That was easy and obvious.

718
01:09:40,449 --> 01:09:42,144
What couldn't you say?

719
01:09:42,251 --> 01:09:44,082
What were you afraid to say?

720
01:09:50,526 --> 01:09:52,221
l love you.

721
01:10:02,371 --> 01:10:04,134
The plan that's
federally supported...

722
01:10:04,239 --> 01:10:05,501
would ease the debt burden...

723
01:10:05,774 --> 01:10:07,503
and control the soaring
cost of medicine...

724
01:10:07,776 --> 01:10:09,744
making health care
more readily available...

725
01:10:09,912 --> 01:10:11,504
to those who need it most--

726
01:10:11,780 --> 01:10:12,906
small businesses...

727
01:10:13,015 --> 01:10:14,505
independent contractors...

728
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:16,182
and the unemployed.

729
01:10:16,285 --> 01:10:17,718
lt's a shame that...

730
01:10:17,820 --> 01:10:19,947
What the hell is this?

731
01:10:20,022 --> 01:10:21,819
Tough way to find out--

732
01:10:21,924 --> 01:10:24,791
What do they think
they're doing?

733
01:10:24,893 --> 01:10:26,292
l don't know.

734
01:10:27,930 --> 01:10:30,228
l mean, l tried to call you.

735
01:10:36,839 --> 01:10:37,965
l'm sorry.

736
01:10:39,475 --> 01:10:41,966
This is Brad Daly,
general manager of KTVM...

737
01:10:42,277 --> 01:10:43,437
in touch with you.

738
01:11:41,036 --> 01:11:42,003
Let's go for a drive...

739
01:11:43,539 --> 01:11:45,166
all three of us.

740
01:11:46,975 --> 01:11:48,840
All three of us?

741
01:11:50,813 --> 01:11:52,781
We shouldn't be doing this.

742
01:11:52,881 --> 01:11:54,109
lt's completion.

743
01:11:54,216 --> 01:11:57,310
A final memorial,
the kind she would have liked.

744
01:11:59,521 --> 01:12:00,818
l just feel like--

745
01:12:00,923 --> 01:12:03,414
lt's your chance
to say good-bye...

746
01:12:05,327 --> 01:12:06,851
and mine, too.

747
01:12:08,430 --> 01:12:10,398
They say it might rain.

748
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:13,161
One can always hope.

749
01:12:16,338 --> 01:12:17,862
Are you sure you can drive?

750
01:12:17,973 --> 01:12:20,703
Yeah.
This is an automatic, right?

751
01:12:23,378 --> 01:12:25,175
l'm just kidding.

752
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:28,738
l used to have to drive my mom
home when she was too blasted.

753
01:12:40,863 --> 01:12:42,330
Slow down.

754
01:12:42,397 --> 01:12:44,194
l thought you could drive.

755
01:12:45,067 --> 01:12:48,525
Well, it was on an interstate--
all straight, no turns.

756
01:12:51,807 --> 01:12:55,174
Aren't you supposed to shift
that thing once in a while?

757
01:12:57,246 --> 01:12:58,838
OK, forget shifting.

758
01:13:09,524 --> 01:13:10,889
lt's so weird.

759
01:13:11,126 --> 01:13:12,286
What?

760
01:13:13,762 --> 01:13:19,701
A whole person ending up
in something so small.

761
01:13:21,970 --> 01:13:23,699
Watch it!

762
01:13:25,774 --> 01:13:26,763
Sorry.

763
01:13:30,379 --> 01:13:32,711
l'm not going to say anything.

764
01:13:46,995 --> 01:13:48,394
What is that?

765
01:13:49,498 --> 01:13:50,760
What?

766
01:13:50,866 --> 01:13:52,333
That song.

767
01:13:52,434 --> 01:13:54,136
What are you talking about?

768
01:13:54,136 --> 01:13:56,127
You were just humming.

769
01:13:56,238 --> 01:13:57,330
So?

770
01:13:57,472 --> 01:13:59,133
Where'd you hear it?

771
01:13:59,241 --> 01:14:00,674
l don't know.

772
01:14:00,776 --> 01:14:03,040
l do. l wrote it.

773
01:14:03,145 --> 01:14:05,705
Dad recorded it for Mom
for her birthday.

774
01:14:07,516 --> 01:14:09,814
You heard it in her room.

775
01:14:09,918 --> 01:14:11,715
So?

776
01:14:14,723 --> 01:14:16,190
So...

777
01:14:16,325 --> 01:14:18,452
she was playing it that morning.

778
01:14:19,328 --> 01:14:21,193
Oh, my God.

779
01:14:21,296 --> 01:14:23,161
You were there.

780
01:14:23,231 --> 01:14:24,789
What did she say to you?

781
01:14:30,872 --> 01:14:32,874
She was about to kill herself.

782
01:14:32,874 --> 01:14:35,240
She must have said something.

783
01:14:35,377 --> 01:14:38,437
Why won't you tell me
what my mother said?

784
01:14:41,316 --> 01:14:43,716
-Please stop!
-l want to hear you say it!

785
01:14:43,819 --> 01:14:45,821
Are you accusing me
of something?

786
01:14:45,821 --> 01:14:47,948
Why, did you do something?

787
01:14:48,023 --> 01:14:50,787
Everybody always
ends up blaming me!

788
01:14:50,859 --> 01:14:53,828
l thought you were different!
l thought we were real friends!

789
01:14:54,763 --> 01:14:55,957
Look out!

790
01:16:40,936 --> 01:16:42,130
Mr. Cooper?

791
01:16:44,372 --> 01:16:46,875
l know you probably feel
like strangling her...

792
01:16:46,875 --> 01:16:48,502
but you'll have to hold off.

793
01:16:48,777 --> 01:16:49,937
She's had a head injury.

794
01:16:50,178 --> 01:16:52,476
One of the nurses said
she's been hallucinating.

795
01:16:52,747 --> 01:16:55,978
l want to keep her here
for at least a couple of days.

796
01:16:56,451 --> 01:16:57,679
Have fun.

797
01:16:57,786 --> 01:17:01,244
Nurse will chase you out
in about ten minutes.

798
01:17:17,239 --> 01:17:19,139
Everything is lvy.

799
01:17:20,742 --> 01:17:22,039
She did it.

800
01:17:24,913 --> 01:17:26,744
What the hell is this?

801
01:17:29,217 --> 01:17:30,343
That's real.

802
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:33,481
Where is she?

803
01:17:34,823 --> 01:17:36,688
This is unbelievable.

804
01:17:36,791 --> 01:17:38,418
l don't want her
at the house anymore.

805
01:17:38,527 --> 01:17:40,427
What the hell's
the matter with you?

806
01:17:42,197 --> 01:17:44,097
She killed my mother.

807
01:17:44,199 --> 01:17:46,099
Your mother committed suicide.

808
01:17:46,234 --> 01:17:48,464
You almost killed yourself.
You almost killed your friend.

809
01:17:48,737 --> 01:17:49,829
Me?

810
01:17:49,971 --> 01:17:51,871
Who drove?
Who took your mother's urn?

811
01:17:53,341 --> 01:17:55,935
Just stop the lying, will you?

812
01:17:56,044 --> 01:17:57,238
l'm not lying.

813
01:17:57,345 --> 01:17:59,336
l know you were driving.

814
01:18:01,149 --> 01:18:03,379
She's gotten to you, too,
hasn't she?

815
01:18:04,753 --> 01:18:06,243
That's enough.

816
01:18:09,357 --> 01:18:11,086
See you in the morning.

817
01:19:30,305 --> 01:19:32,398
Hey, Charla,
room eight-twenty-eight, OK?

818
01:19:34,876 --> 01:19:37,401
We ought to put motors
on these things.

819
01:20:55,857 --> 01:20:57,415
Nice outfit.

820
01:20:57,525 --> 01:20:59,891
Did you do the blood yourself?

821
01:21:09,237 --> 01:21:10,261
Thanks.

822
01:21:10,405 --> 01:21:12,066
Take care.

823
01:21:12,207 --> 01:21:13,367
And enjoy the Duds.

824
01:21:13,475 --> 01:21:15,375
l stole them myself.

825
01:23:12,760 --> 01:23:15,456
Oh, my God. lt's Sylvie.

826
01:23:28,376 --> 01:23:29,900
Shit!

827
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:40,512
l can find her.

828
01:23:40,788 --> 01:23:42,517
You're hurting me!
