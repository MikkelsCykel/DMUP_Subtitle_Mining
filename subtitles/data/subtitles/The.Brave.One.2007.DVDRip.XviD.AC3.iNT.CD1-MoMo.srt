<i>I'm Erica Bain. And as you know,</i>
<i>I walk the city.</i>

2
00:01:03,379 --> 00:01:08,043
<i>I bitch and moan about it.</i>
<i>I walk and watch and listen...</i>

3
00:01:08,218 --> 00:01:11,085
<i>... a witness to all</i>
<i>the beauty and ugliness...</i>

4
00:01:11,254 --> 00:01:14,314
<i>... that is disappearing</i>
<i>from our beloved city.</i>

5
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:17,119
<i>Last week took me to</i>
<i>the gray depths of the East River...</i>

6
00:01:17,293 --> 00:01:20,456
<i>... where Dimitri Panchenko</i>
<i>swims his morning laps...</i>

7
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:23,622
<i>... like he has every morning</i>
<i>since the 1960s.</i>

8
00:01:25,401 --> 00:01:30,805
<i>Today I walked by the acres of scaffolding</i>
<i>outside what used to be the Plaza Hotel...</i>

9
00:01:30,974 --> 00:01:33,636
<i>... and I thought about Eloise.</i>

10
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:36,641
<i>Remember Kay Thompson's Eloise?</i>

11
00:01:36,813 --> 00:01:39,714
<i>Eloise who lived in the Plaza Hotel...</i>

12
00:01:39,883 --> 00:01:44,013
<i>... with her dog Weenie and her parents,</i>
<i>who were always away...</i>

13
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:48,681
<i>... and her English nanny who had</i>
<i>eight hairpins made out of bones.</i>

14
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:54,353
<i>That Eloise. The adored brat</i>
<i>of my childhood. A little punk kid...</i>

15
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:59,400
<i>Sid Vicious, spewing beer from his teeth</i>
<i>in the Chelsea Hotel.</i>

16
00:01:59,569 --> 00:02:02,003
<i>Andy Warhol, his sunglasses...</i>

17
00:02:02,172 --> 00:02:07,041
<i>Edgar Allan Poe, freeing live monkeys</i>
<i>from the crates of a crumbling schooner...</i>

18
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,509
<i>... on the oily slips of South Street.</i>

19
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,807
<i>Stories of a city...</i>

20
00:02:12,982 --> 00:02:17,510
<i>... that is disappearing before our eyes.</i>
<i>Its people swept over...</i>

21
00:02:17,687 --> 00:02:20,155
<i>So, what will be left of those stories?</i>

22
00:02:20,323 --> 00:02:25,488
<i>Are we going to have to construct an</i>
<i>imaginary city to house our memories?</i>

23
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:30,028
<i>Because when you love something,</i>
<i>every time a bit of it goes...</i>

24
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,260
<i>... you lose a piece of yourself.</i>

25
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:37,831
<i>So where's Eloise going to sleep tonight?</i>
<i>Can you hear her ghost...</i>

26
00:02:38,007 --> 00:02:42,171
<i>... wandering around the collapsing</i>
<i>corridors of her beloved Plaza...</i>

27
00:02:42,345 --> 00:02:44,575
<i>... trying to find her nanny's room...</i>

28
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:47,682
<i>... calling out</i>
<i>to the construction workers...</i>

29
00:02:47,851 --> 00:02:50,581
...in a voice that nobody hears:

30
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:54,746
"Has anyone seen my turtle,
Skipperdee?"

31
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:59,691
This is Erica Bain, and you've been listening
to <i>Street Walk</i> on WNKW.

32
00:02:59,863 --> 00:03:02,923
<i>- And this is 90. 1, WNKW.</i>
- All right.

33
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:06,697
- See you next week.
- Have a good one, Erica.

34
00:03:10,373 --> 00:03:11,965
Hey, I'm out of here.

35
00:03:12,141 --> 00:03:14,439
Did Eloise really mean that much to you?

36
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:17,512
Oh, come on, Carol.
Weren't you ever a little girl?

37
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,808
Not the kind of little girl that
remembers the name of her turtle.

38
00:03:20,984 --> 00:03:22,815
Anyway, good show.

39
00:03:22,986 --> 00:03:26,114
Look, Bravo called again
about that TV spot.

40
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:28,086
You know what? I'm...

41
00:03:28,258 --> 00:03:30,590
I'm not a face. I'm just a voice.

42
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,752
The shows are on the website.
People can download them for free.

43
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:36,160
- Yeah, exactly.
- Maybe.

44
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,128
Bye.

45
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:42,297
- Hello?
<i>- Hey.</i>

46
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,565
- Hello.
<i>- What are you wearing?</i>

47
00:03:44,741 --> 00:03:47,938
Green scrubs, tied at the waist,
very sexy V-neck.

48
00:03:48,778 --> 00:03:51,542
<i>- Short-sleeved little number.</i>
- How about the sexy green hat?

49
00:03:51,714 --> 00:03:53,045
- Still got that?
<i>- In my hand.</i>

50
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:56,310
You like it more than the others,
less than the others or the same?

51
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:57,817
Oh, yeah. I'm at the place...

52
00:03:57,987 --> 00:04:01,479
...and I wanna make sure you're still okay
with the cream and the orange.

53
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:02,886
Yeah, cream and orange.

54
00:04:03,059 --> 00:04:05,653
Actually, it's not cream.
It's vanilla. But that's fine.

55
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:07,386
It's not cream. It's vanilla.

56
00:04:07,563 --> 00:04:10,999
- Who cares? Let's go get married tonight.
<i>- Your mother cares.</i>

57
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:13,397
Trust me, she wants invitations.

58
00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:15,537
Yeah, these are good. Thanks.

59
00:04:15,705 --> 00:04:19,072
Hey, listen. For tonight, if you meet me
at Nicole's art thing...

60
00:04:19,242 --> 00:04:21,210
<i>... you don't have to</i>
<i>talk to anyone but me.</i>

61
00:04:21,377 --> 00:04:22,969
<i>- Maybe.</i>
- Come on.

62
00:04:23,146 --> 00:04:26,274
<i>- I've got a game, haven't I?</i>
- You're not coming?

63
00:04:26,449 --> 00:04:28,474
<i>- Look, I've gotta go.</i>
- What?

64
00:04:28,651 --> 00:04:30,141
<i>I do love you.</i>

65
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,720
Yeah. I love you too.

66
00:04:33,957 --> 00:04:35,982
- Hi.
- Hi. Oh, you're James.

67
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:38,188
- I'm Erica. I'm Nicole's friend.
- Hi.

68
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:41,091
These are good.
They're really cool. I love them.

69
00:04:41,264 --> 00:04:45,064
The Laundromat is in a town in Jersey
where Diane Arbus used to do her laundry.

70
00:04:45,234 --> 00:04:48,362
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, that gun store is down in Chinatown.

71
00:04:49,172 --> 00:04:51,766
Berenice Abbott shot it in the '30s.

72
00:04:51,941 --> 00:04:55,001
It's really evocative, you know?

73
00:04:55,178 --> 00:04:58,614
Kind of quiet. I like that.
It doesn't make too much noise.

74
00:04:58,781 --> 00:04:59,805
Thanks.

75
00:04:59,983 --> 00:05:02,213
Bring more drinks, less shrimp. More.

76
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:03,943
Where you going? You're leaving?

77
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,487
- No, no. I'm staying. I'm staying.
- Oh, my God, you're such a bad liar.

78
00:05:07,657 --> 00:05:08,749
I know, but I try.

79
00:05:08,925 --> 00:05:11,485
You have to convince him
to come to one of these things.

80
00:05:11,661 --> 00:05:14,027
He can't avoid us forever. Oh, my God.

81
00:05:14,197 --> 00:05:16,631
- What are you doing here?
- Don't you love this woman?

82
00:05:16,799 --> 00:05:19,768
I could take her or leave her.
You guys...

83
00:05:19,936 --> 00:05:21,995
...this, when it starts, it's disgusting.

84
00:05:22,171 --> 00:05:23,695
- We have to go.
- You're too happy.

85
00:05:23,873 --> 00:05:24,897
- Say goodbye.
- Bye.

86
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:26,166
- I hate you.
- I love you.

87
00:05:26,342 --> 00:05:27,969
I really... I hate you so much.

88
00:05:33,549 --> 00:05:36,177
Oh, God. It's so pretty out.

89
00:05:36,786 --> 00:05:39,050
Tell you what. I'll get him.
You sit here. Okay?

90
00:05:39,222 --> 00:05:41,281
No, let me get him.

91
00:05:41,457 --> 00:05:43,948
- Okay. Will you get me my jacket too?
- Fine.

92
00:05:44,127 --> 00:05:46,561
Here. Take this.

93
00:05:46,729 --> 00:05:48,253
Thanks.

94
00:05:55,738 --> 00:05:57,069
Hey.

95
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,970
Oh, I can open my own door.

96
00:06:01,044 --> 00:06:02,568
Thank you.

97
00:06:13,823 --> 00:06:16,155
Good boy. Good boy.

98
00:06:17,527 --> 00:06:19,893
- Hi, puppy!
- Here.

99
00:06:21,898 --> 00:06:24,662
Are you gonna be that crabby
when you get older?

100
00:06:24,834 --> 00:06:27,564
I am older. And I'm way meaner.

101
00:06:27,737 --> 00:06:30,865
Look, she gave me an apple. Here, baby.

102
00:06:33,876 --> 00:06:37,312
- So she is human.
- That was too big a bite.

103
00:06:37,747 --> 00:06:42,275
That was too big a bite.
I didn't say you could eat the whole thing.

104
00:06:42,452 --> 00:06:43,817
You know what?

105
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:49,515
I could get about maybe five days and we
could go to the place with the water and...

106
00:06:49,692 --> 00:06:53,287
...find good food and lots of sleeping.

107
00:06:53,463 --> 00:06:55,328
Yes, I concur.

108
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:58,030
Here, boy. Good boy.

109
00:07:00,803 --> 00:07:02,498
Good boy.

110
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:08,007
Don't give it to him. Throw it.

111
00:07:13,716 --> 00:07:17,311
- I wasn't mucking about, you know.
- What about?

112
00:07:17,487 --> 00:07:20,047
Why can't we go down
to city hall tonight?

113
00:07:20,456 --> 00:07:23,448
- Because it's closed.
- Tomorrow, then.

114
00:07:24,894 --> 00:07:27,021
David, you have a family.
I don't, you know?

115
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:31,326
- You're not marrying my family.
- Well, I am, kind of.

116
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:34,496
I mean, I hope I am.

117
00:07:37,073 --> 00:07:41,237
Your mom is so sweet and she just...
She wants the whole deal, you know?

118
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:44,072
She wants the invitations...

119
00:07:44,247 --> 00:07:48,843
...and the band playing and the minister.

120
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:53,185
I don't know. Maybe I do too,
you know? Because...

121
00:07:53,356 --> 00:07:56,291
...it's not like I'm gonna do this twice.

122
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,187
You're not?

123
00:08:00,596 --> 00:08:02,791
No, I'm not.

124
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,501
That's the nicest thing
you ever said to me.

125
00:08:25,454 --> 00:08:27,081
Where's Curtis?

126
00:08:27,356 --> 00:08:29,085
Oi, Curtis!

127
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:30,782
Come on, boy.

128
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,960
Come on, pup! Did he go up there?

129
00:08:35,398 --> 00:08:37,423
- He's not in there, is he?
- Come on!

130
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,595
Curtis?

131
00:08:41,837 --> 00:08:42,861
Hey!

132
00:08:43,973 --> 00:08:45,270
- There he is.
- Curtis.

133
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:52,471
- Come on, boy.
- Curtis, come on.

134
00:08:55,885 --> 00:08:57,113
Hey, Curtis?

135
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,484
- Hey.
- Curtis.

136
00:09:04,227 --> 00:09:05,660
Hey.

137
00:09:07,396 --> 00:09:10,559
- What's up, boy?
- What's wrong, sweetheart?

138
00:09:10,733 --> 00:09:12,030
Hey.

139
00:09:12,201 --> 00:09:14,635
Man, don't you know
there's a fucking leash law?

140
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:17,068
Yeah, don't you fucking know better?

141
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,306
Yeah. I'm sorry. Thanks for finding him.

142
00:09:20,843 --> 00:09:23,471
It's... It's all good, bro. It's all good.

143
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:25,838
But...

144
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:28,677
...I get a reward or something?

145
00:09:33,389 --> 00:09:35,323
Our gratitude. Now give him to me.

146
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:38,460
Come on, man. You know gratitude
ain't worth shit around here.

147
00:09:38,628 --> 00:09:40,528
- You're hurting him!
- Give me the dog.

148
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:44,932
No, I don't think so.
See, I kind of like this dog.

149
00:09:45,101 --> 00:09:47,626
I think he's a keeper. A keeper.

150
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,831
Smile, baby.

151
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:59,477
- You are a cunt.
- Fuck you, bitch!

152
00:09:59,649 --> 00:10:03,813
Come on, motherfucker.
That's what I thought, you stupid pussy.

153
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,517
- Look...
- Go.

154
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:09,180
I haven't got much money.
You can have what I've got.

155
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:12,555
Give me your watch, give me your
ring. Let's go, I ain't got all day.

156
00:10:12,728 --> 00:10:14,252
Hurry the fuck up, princess.

157
00:10:14,897 --> 00:10:17,058
- Let's go. Hurry up!
- Give him the shit.

158
00:10:17,233 --> 00:10:18,962
- Get the fuck over here.
- Fuck!

159
00:10:20,836 --> 00:10:23,737
- David!
- I fucking missed it!

160
00:10:23,939 --> 00:10:25,167
Where you going?

161
00:10:25,341 --> 00:10:27,741
- Action!
- Think you're fucking with me?!

162
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,110
You just made my day!

163
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:33,939
Popped your motherfucking cherry!

164
00:10:35,484 --> 00:10:37,179
Let's even shit out.

165
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:40,045
Ready for your close-up, cunt?!

166
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:41,450
Heads up!

167
00:10:41,824 --> 00:10:42,848
Hollywood!

168
00:10:43,025 --> 00:10:45,050
Think you're fucking with me?!

169
00:10:48,164 --> 00:10:50,632
You ain't got nothing to say now, fool!

170
00:10:51,534 --> 00:10:55,527
- David.
- Oh, how cute. Lovebirds.

171
00:10:55,705 --> 00:10:58,902
- A chickenhead and a faggot.
- Say "cheese," bitch!

172
00:12:05,007 --> 00:12:06,531
This is the emergency room.

173
00:12:06,709 --> 00:12:09,507
- Did you get any sleep?
- No. Where's Murrow?

174
00:12:09,678 --> 00:12:11,441
We're looking for him.

175
00:12:11,614 --> 00:12:14,947
She was dead on arrival
and her fingerprints are all over the gun.

176
00:12:15,217 --> 00:12:17,151
- Where?
- Bedroom.

177
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:19,150
Daughter called 911.

178
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:22,154
Thanks. I wanna see her.

179
00:12:30,199 --> 00:12:33,657
- So he's laughing again.
- Yeah.

180
00:12:38,707 --> 00:12:42,074
Listen, the kid's in a waiting room
with ACS. I'll meet you over there.

181
00:12:49,151 --> 00:12:51,483
We need your signature right here.

182
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:56,184
Where is she?

183
00:13:02,631 --> 00:13:06,089
- Can I talk to her?
- You can try.

184
00:13:08,337 --> 00:13:10,202
Hey, sweetie.

185
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:12,602
Can I have a word with you?

186
00:13:14,777 --> 00:13:18,543
We're just gonna be right here.
All right.

187
00:13:19,748 --> 00:13:21,807
You like lollipops?

188
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,460
Pick one.

189
00:13:36,365 --> 00:13:38,890
That was the one I was gonna pick.

190
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:45,472
You know, sweetie...

191
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:52,044
...something you should know. Your
mommy, she was really worried about you.

192
00:13:52,948 --> 00:13:58,113
And if she could, she would tell you
that you can trust me.

193
00:14:04,527 --> 00:14:06,620
Did your stepfather hurt your mommy?

194
00:14:07,396 --> 00:14:08,886
Sean? Sean!

195
00:14:09,064 --> 00:14:10,554
Okay. Okay, step back!

196
00:14:10,733 --> 00:14:12,667
- I want my daughter!
- Get back!

197
00:14:12,835 --> 00:14:15,429
All right! All right.

198
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,434
You don't have the right.

199
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:25,102
- I do...
- At a time like this, I need to see her.

200
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,340
No, you don't. I do have the right.

201
00:14:27,516 --> 00:14:30,110
- She is my daughter.
- No, she is your stepdaughter.

202
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,277
And you know
how this whole thing works.

203
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:35,651
You done been through this a thousand
times. You hire your lawyers...

204
00:14:35,824 --> 00:14:38,759
...and you do your thing.
But right now, we're gonna do ours.

205
00:14:41,764 --> 00:14:44,995
- I'm gonna take a walk. You deal with him.
- Yeah, I got it.

206
00:14:47,937 --> 00:14:51,464
That was Dr. Sterling. Okay, bye-bye.

207
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:14,019
It's a hell of a thing.

208
00:15:14,597 --> 00:15:17,862
- Yup.
- I heard her show once.

209
00:16:00,576 --> 00:16:02,271
Erica?

210
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,871
Erica, can you hear me?

211
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,881
Erica?

212
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:12,547
You had the service?

213
00:16:13,122 --> 00:16:15,750
They didn't know when
you were going to wake up...

214
00:16:15,924 --> 00:16:18,552
...if you were going to wake up.

215
00:16:19,094 --> 00:16:21,722
You were gone for three weeks.

216
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:25,389
We had to let him go. We had to.

217
00:16:25,634 --> 00:16:27,363
I wanna see him again.

218
00:16:27,536 --> 00:16:29,197
- He's gone.
- I wanna see him again!

219
00:16:29,371 --> 00:16:31,703
He's gone, honey.

220
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:38,804
He would have been happy
that you lived.

221
00:16:51,827 --> 00:16:55,695
<i>Nurse Bench, you have a call on one-four.</i>
<i>Nurse Bench.</i>

222
00:16:58,567 --> 00:17:03,561
I don't know. All the faces
are starting to blur together. L...

223
00:17:03,739 --> 00:17:05,502
I just can't tell anymore, you know?

224
00:17:05,674 --> 00:17:09,405
You gotta help us here. We need
something from you, anything.

225
00:17:10,145 --> 00:17:12,238
Let's start over again.

226
00:17:12,414 --> 00:17:17,408
He hit your boyfriend with the pipe.
Once, twice, three times?

227
00:17:18,754 --> 00:17:20,153
We know how tough it can be...

228
00:17:20,322 --> 00:17:23,155
...to go back there...
- Do you, huh?

229
00:17:24,993 --> 00:17:28,520
Look, Miss Bain, we're on your side.

230
00:17:30,933 --> 00:17:32,491
Yeah.

231
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:34,632
I know that.

232
00:17:35,537 --> 00:17:36,834
You're the good guys.

233
00:17:38,941 --> 00:17:41,000
So how come it doesn't feel like that?

234
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:07,841
<i>Please leave a message for David and Erica</i>
<i>after the beep.</i>

235
00:22:08,543 --> 00:22:11,808
<i>Hey, it's me. Call me at the gallery.</i>

236
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:15,438

238
00:24:16,004 --> 00:24:18,438
Ma'am, can I help you?

239
00:24:19,741 --> 00:24:22,039
Detective O'Connor and Detective Pitney,
please.

240
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:26,112
Pitney and O'Connor are out.
Can anyone else help you?

241
00:24:26,648 --> 00:24:28,411
Well...

242
00:24:28,583 --> 00:24:30,915
...you know,
I wanted to check on my case.

243
00:24:31,086 --> 00:24:33,714
I've been calling and
we've been playing phone tag...

244
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:36,153
...and I thought that if I came down...
- Okay.

245
00:24:36,324 --> 00:24:38,349
What kind of case did you have?

246
00:24:41,296 --> 00:24:43,389
My boyfriend was beaten to death.

247
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:47,797
Oh, I'm sorry.
Do you have a complaint report number?

248
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:50,966
- No, I don't know it.
- And what was his name?

249
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:53,966
David Kirmani.

250
00:24:54,809 --> 00:24:57,607
K-l-R-M-A-N-I.

251
00:24:58,947 --> 00:25:00,972
It might be under Erica Bain.

252
00:25:04,786 --> 00:25:06,947
About how long ago did it happen?

253
00:25:07,122 --> 00:25:08,612
June 11 th.

254
00:25:11,059 --> 00:25:13,118
Okay. I realize how difficult
this can be...

255
00:25:13,295 --> 00:25:16,196
...but if you'd please be patient
and have a seat over there...

256
00:25:16,364 --> 00:25:18,798
...an officer will be down shortly
to help you.

257
00:25:18,967 --> 00:25:20,525
Okay.

258
00:25:43,158 --> 00:25:44,853
I realize how difficult it can be...

259
00:25:45,026 --> 00:25:47,927
...but if you'd please be patient
and have a seat over there...

260
00:25:48,096 --> 00:25:51,065
...an officer will be down shortly
to help you.

261
00:26:17,959 --> 00:26:20,052
- Wanna get something to eat?
- What's up, guys?

262
00:26:20,228 --> 00:26:21,923
- Hey.
- You saw the game last night?

263
00:26:22,097 --> 00:26:23,689
Man.

264
00:26:35,577 --> 00:26:37,101
Could I help you?

265
00:26:40,548 --> 00:26:42,641
Yeah. I wanna buy a gun.

266
00:26:42,817 --> 00:26:44,307
License?

267
00:26:44,552 --> 00:26:47,612
Oh, yeah, of course.
I need a license, yeah.

268
00:26:47,789 --> 00:26:52,226
Once you get one, fill out this form,
and we'll notify you in 30 days.

269
00:26:52,394 --> 00:26:54,055
I need to get something now.

270
00:26:54,229 --> 00:26:56,094
Sorry. That's illegal.

271
00:26:58,199 --> 00:26:59,564
Hey!

272
00:27:00,602 --> 00:27:02,900
I won't survive 30 days.

273
00:27:12,647 --> 00:27:14,171
Hey.

274
00:27:14,349 --> 00:27:17,409
- What happened to you?
- Me? Nothing.

275
00:27:17,585 --> 00:27:19,450
A thousand dollars.

276
00:27:20,422 --> 00:27:22,151
A thousand dollars?

277
00:27:22,324 --> 00:27:24,588
Okay, but I need to learn how to use it.

278
00:27:24,759 --> 00:27:27,751
No shit. Follow me.

279
00:27:51,453 --> 00:27:53,148
Wait right here.

280
00:27:56,991 --> 00:27:58,583
In here.

281
00:28:01,229 --> 00:28:04,630
It's a Kahr K9.
Check to see if it's loaded.

282
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,027
How do I do that?

283
00:28:06,201 --> 00:28:09,170
The chamber. Pull the slide back.

284
00:28:09,337 --> 00:28:14,138
It's got internal safety so you don't
shoot yourself. Loads from the handle.

285
00:28:14,709 --> 00:28:16,301
All right.

286
00:28:19,647 --> 00:28:21,911
You pay me now, it's yours.

287
00:28:25,987 --> 00:28:28,114
I'll throw in the bullets.

288
00:28:33,595 --> 00:28:34,857
Yeah, I'll take it.

289
00:29:01,122 --> 00:29:02,919
Got it, got it, got it.

290
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:32,543
You shouldn't smoke. It'll kill you.

291
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:34,985
I don't care.

292
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:38,618
There's plenty of ways to die.

293
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:43,789
But you have to figure out a way to live.

294
00:29:43,965 --> 00:29:47,696
Now, that's hard.

295
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,718
Look at you, all sophisticated.

296
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:14,221
- You shouldn't be working this late.
- I had a client dinner.

297
00:30:15,663 --> 00:30:17,824
Hey, can I get a dirty martini
for the lady?

298
00:30:17,999 --> 00:30:20,297
You said this was business, Sean.

299
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:22,627
It is.

300
00:30:24,506 --> 00:30:26,440
Eighty-six that.

301
00:30:28,476 --> 00:30:31,138
Okay, l...
I need a favor from you.

302
00:30:32,714 --> 00:30:34,238
You...

303
00:30:35,383 --> 00:30:39,114
- You heard about that Murrow thing, right?
- His wife killed herself.

304
00:30:39,521 --> 00:30:42,422
Oh, come on. Women don't
shoot themselves in the face.

305
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:45,256
At least in my experience.

306
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:50,193
Where do they shoot themselves,
in your experience?

307
00:30:53,001 --> 00:30:54,229
The heart.

308
00:31:01,509 --> 00:31:03,534
Jackie, I been...

309
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:07,745
...chasing after this asshole
for three straight years.

310
00:31:07,916 --> 00:31:11,511
And right when his wife was ready
to turn state's evidence on him...

311
00:31:11,686 --> 00:31:16,555
...instead of blowing the lid off of him,
she blows off her own head.

312
00:31:16,724 --> 00:31:19,090
- Come on.
- You don't let go, do you?

313
00:31:24,432 --> 00:31:26,263
So what can I do?

314
00:31:29,671 --> 00:31:33,107
Well, she has a daughter.
Had a daughter.

315
00:31:33,274 --> 00:31:34,707
And...

316
00:31:35,843 --> 00:31:38,141
...her daughter knows something.

317
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:41,544
But now he's asked for custody of her
and then he's gonna get it.

318
00:31:41,716 --> 00:31:44,184
- Is he the father?
- No, no. He's her stepfather.

319
00:31:44,352 --> 00:31:46,547
- And you want her made a ward of court.
- Yes.

320
00:31:46,721 --> 00:31:48,951
She knows something
and she's not safe with him.

321
00:31:49,123 --> 00:31:53,116
Look, all I'm asking you to do
is just act on her behalf.

322
00:31:53,294 --> 00:31:54,818
Please.

323
00:31:58,232 --> 00:32:00,132
Sean, I'm your ex-wife.

324
00:32:00,635 --> 00:32:02,466
Conflict of interest.

325
00:32:03,471 --> 00:32:05,666
And besides, I don't do pro bono.

326
00:32:10,378 --> 00:32:12,039
You used to.

327
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:15,146
Yeah, well, I grew up.

328
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:49,874
When did you get out?!

329
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:52,576
- You won't let me see my kids?
- You can't be here! Court order!

330
00:32:52,754 --> 00:32:55,587
- I'm calling 911!
- Lf I can't see them, you won't see them!

331
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:02,919
Try seeing them now.

332
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:08,865
It's my money too.

333
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:02,020
I can hear you breathing.

334
00:34:28,549 --> 00:34:29,573
No.

335
00:35:51,666 --> 00:35:53,964
- Squad central.
<i>- Notify upon arrival.</i>

336
00:35:54,135 --> 00:35:56,729
- Damn.
- We're a 10-84 at 110 and Lenox.

337
00:35:56,904 --> 00:35:59,771
<i>10-4. Eighty-five to patrol supervisor</i>
<i>on the scene.</i>

338
00:35:59,941 --> 00:36:03,399
- 10-4.
- Looks like the circus made it to town.

339
00:36:34,242 --> 00:36:35,334
Any IDs?

340
00:36:35,509 --> 00:36:38,239
Victim's a 30-year-old Vietnamese female.
Ida Combs.

341
00:36:40,915 --> 00:36:42,644
- Where's the other body?
- This way.

342
00:36:44,352 --> 00:36:48,186
Got a 39-year-old, Sandy Combs.
White male.

343
00:36:48,356 --> 00:36:52,486
Looks like he was a roadie for Aerosmith.
I don't think those guys have a dental plan.

344
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:54,787
Guy had a rap sheet longer than my dick.

345
00:36:54,962 --> 00:36:57,624
So in other words, no priors.

346
00:36:58,232 --> 00:36:59,790
Easy.

347
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:06,830
So we got us a Sandy Combs and
an Ida Combs. What does that tell us?

348
00:37:07,008 --> 00:37:10,102
They're married.
I'm way ahead of you, pal.

349
00:37:10,278 --> 00:37:13,941
- Yeah, that's one way of ending it.
- You know, what's wrong with divorce?

350
00:37:14,382 --> 00:37:16,111
Everything.

351
00:37:16,751 --> 00:37:18,878
Divorce sucks.

352
00:37:20,554 --> 00:37:21,851
Okay, so tell me.

353
00:37:22,023 --> 00:37:24,583
Well, she took three in the torso
with a.38.

354
00:37:24,759 --> 00:37:28,855
Then somebody smoked him with a 9 mm
automatic. Don't ask me who, though.

355
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:32,062
And we found these casings.

356
00:37:34,101 --> 00:37:37,764
Three casings. Looks like there's
a partial print on one, but it's smudged.

357
00:37:38,306 --> 00:37:39,671
Anybody check surveillance?

358
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,638
That monitor's working,
but the machine's empty.

359
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,421
Machine's working.

360
00:37:55,957 --> 00:37:57,686
- But where's the tape?
- Don't know.

361
00:38:03,597 --> 00:38:05,622
And why didn't he take the money?

362
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,291
They chickened out, got scared?

363
00:38:10,871 --> 00:38:15,171
We got three casings, only one hit.
How about that?

364
00:38:15,343 --> 00:38:18,642
Maybe he's farsighted, crappy shooter.
Who knows?

365
00:38:18,813 --> 00:38:21,338
Or he never fired a gun before.

366
00:38:57,485 --> 00:38:59,248
<i>It is...</i>

New York, like any metropolis...

380
00:39:48,169 --> 00:39:53,072
New York, like any metropolis,
is an organism that changes, mutates.

381
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:57,609
Building sprout-like chromosomes
on the DNA of its streets.

382
00:40:11,959 --> 00:40:14,894

Look, I've got... I've got two shows
that are almost finished.

386
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:47,752
They're already mixed. All they need is an
intro and an outro, which I could do live.

387
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:49,825
I've got six shows in various stages.

388
00:40:49,997 --> 00:40:55,196
I've got all these stories in my files.
You know, new stuff, better stuff.

389
00:40:55,569 --> 00:40:58,970
And I know what I'm doing,
and you know that I know what I'm doing.

390
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:02,109
Erica. You've been through so much.

391
00:41:02,276 --> 00:41:04,710
You need more time before
you put yourself out there.

392
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:07,211
- Don't make me beg.
- I don't mean to.

393
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:10,441
But we have a public and I'm not sure
you're ready for it yet.

394
00:41:10,618 --> 00:41:13,052
You telling me I can't work
because of what happened?

395
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:15,552
I did not say that.

396
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:18,451
Look...

397
00:41:20,094 --> 00:41:22,528
...I just need to keep living.

398
00:41:22,696 --> 00:41:25,062
You know, I don't wanna...

399
00:41:25,799 --> 00:41:28,165
I don't wanna disappear.

Let's now join Erica Bain
in our WNKW studios.

403
00:41:47,488 --> 00:41:50,855
Okay, Erica.
Three, two, one, you're on.

This is Erica Bain, and I walk the city.

00:42:24,658 --> 00:42:26,125
New York...

411
00:42:27,528 --> 00:42:29,962
...like any metropolis...

412
00:42:31,732 --> 00:42:33,290
...is...

413

Oh, shit.

414
00:42:49,883 --> 00:42:51,908
New York...

415
00:42:53,354 --> 00:42:56,346
...the safest big city in the world.

416
00:42:58,692 --> 00:43:01,354
But it is horrible...

417
00:43:01,729 --> 00:43:04,596
...to fear the place you once loved.

418
00:43:06,066 --> 00:43:09,593
And to see a street corner
you knew so well...

419
00:43:10,104 --> 00:43:12,595
...and be afraid of its shadow.

420
00:43:13,307 --> 00:43:15,571
To see familiar steps,
be unable to climb them.

421
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:22,005
I never understood
how people lived with fear.

422
00:43:23,117 --> 00:43:25,881
Women afraid to walk home alone...

423
00:43:26,053 --> 00:43:28,283
...people afraid of...

424
00:43:28,555 --> 00:43:30,546
...white powder in their mailbox...

425
00:43:30,724 --> 00:43:34,251
...darkness and night.

426
00:43:34,928 --> 00:43:38,227
<i>People afraid of people.</i>

427
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:43,127
I always believed that fear
belonged to other people.

428
00:43:44,271 --> 00:43:46,671
Weaker people.

429
00:43:48,976 --> 00:43:51,171
It never touched me.

430
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:58,143
And then it did.

431
00:44:01,655 --> 00:44:04,283
And when it touches you, you know...

432
00:44:04,458 --> 00:44:07,325
...that it's been there all along...

433
00:44:07,494 --> 00:44:12,193
...waiting beneath the surfaces
of everything you loved.

434
00:44:12,633 --> 00:44:16,626
And your skin crawls...

435
00:44:17,871 --> 00:44:19,463
...and your heart sickens...

436
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:24,475
...and you look at the person you once were
walking down that street...

437
00:44:28,115 --> 00:44:30,413
...and you wonder, will you...?

438
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:34,879

443
00:45:57,571 --> 00:46:01,337
Don't nobody talk in New York no more?
I asked you a motherfucking question!

444
00:46:01,508 --> 00:46:04,033
I said, what are you listening to,
you fucking faggot?!

445
00:46:04,211 --> 00:46:05,803
- Radiohead, man.
- Radiohead?

446
00:46:05,979 --> 00:46:07,742
Leave him alone, man!

447
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:09,710
Man, shut the fuck up!

448
00:46:09,883 --> 00:46:12,147
Little man, you ain't know
your pop sucked dick?

449
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:15,755
He's good at it too. Now, you wanna
grow up to be like that punk ass?

450
00:46:15,923 --> 00:46:17,754
That's a nice watch.
How old are you?

451
00:46:17,925 --> 00:46:20,758

- Tell your mom I said "What's up?"

452

Yo, little man, holler at me,

Hey, yo, thanks for the iPod, man.

454

This shit is nice, man.
This is all me right here.

455
00:46:30,637 --> 00:46:33,037
- I'm keeping this joint.
- You kidding me, right?

456
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:34,970
This is cool.

00:46:39,179 --> 00:46:40,441
Oh, shit.

- Bitch, is you crazy?

459
00:46:49,656 --> 00:46:51,089
This is too easy, man.

460
00:46:58,165 --> 00:46:59,462
So...

461
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:04,927
...you gonna give me some Radiohead
too?

462
00:47:12,646 --> 00:47:15,046

00:48:12,539 --> 00:48:15,235
<i>Why don't my hands shake?</i>

466
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:18,611
<i>Why doesn't somebody stop me?</i>

467
00:48:26,353 --> 00:48:28,446
I swear they like Oreos.

468
00:48:28,622 --> 00:48:30,055
Homicide, this is Vitale.

469
00:48:30,223 --> 00:48:32,657
There you go,
you're doing the tricks again.

470
00:48:32,826 --> 00:48:36,387
Upside down. No, come on up.
Gotta come to the top. There you go, baby.

471
00:48:36,563 --> 00:48:38,326
Okay, thank you.

472
00:48:38,599 --> 00:48:41,193
We've got two confirmed shot
on a subway from Brooklyn.

473
00:48:41,368 --> 00:48:44,667
Church Street, lower Manhattan.
Everyone's arguing whose jurisdiction.

474
00:48:44,838 --> 00:48:47,170
- That makes it ours.
- All right, fellas, let's go.

475
00:49:30,851 --> 00:49:34,514
We got two dead bodies inside
the subway car, and no eyewitnesses.

476
00:49:34,688 --> 00:49:36,815
Of course not.
Did you check with BCI?

477
00:49:36,990 --> 00:49:38,218
Yeah, I got this printout.

478
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:39,882
- They here yet?
- Yes, sir.

479
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:42,460
- And I'll get them to you.
- Morning, fellas.

480
00:49:45,132 --> 00:49:47,396
Christ on a cracker.

481
00:49:48,001 --> 00:49:51,732
Well, I hope this is their stop.

482
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:57,438
Got Radiohead, U2, Dixie Chicks.

483
00:49:57,611 --> 00:50:00,444
- No Wu-Tang?
- I don't think this is his.

484
00:50:06,186 --> 00:50:08,017
Money in his pocket.

485
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:21,029
Looks like a 9 mm automatic.

486
00:50:22,736 --> 00:50:25,136
- Like from the other night?
- Yeah.

487
00:50:27,074 --> 00:50:29,634
Check it against Brass Catchers,
see if it matches.

488
00:50:43,256 --> 00:50:44,814
Hey, you.

489
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:50,889
- Just go inside. I came out here for
a smoke. I just wanna go back in.

490
00:50:51,064 --> 00:50:54,761
You're giving me a hard time.
You let my friends in.

491
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:12,115
They both had cash, so neither one of them
was robbed. And they had priors.

492
00:51:12,285 --> 00:51:14,276
A shitload of them.

493
00:51:15,088 --> 00:51:17,648
The guy at Sandy's, he had priors.

494
00:51:17,824 --> 00:51:19,587
I know, but that was domestic.

495
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:22,160
No, but he wasn't robbed.

496
00:51:23,430 --> 00:51:24,590
Or something.

497
00:51:25,465 --> 00:51:28,992
- I mean, what are we missing?
- I wish I knew.

498
00:51:29,836 --> 00:51:32,805
Now, look. You got a small guy sitting.

499
00:51:32,973 --> 00:51:35,703
These two punks come at him with a knife
and, you know...

500
00:51:35,876 --> 00:51:38,572
...he shoots the first one without
getting out of his seat.

501
00:51:38,745 --> 00:51:40,269
Right. Go on, I'm with you.

502
00:51:40,447 --> 00:51:44,349
It's like maybe Mr. Average Joe just
decided, "I'm not gonna take it anymore.

503
00:51:44,618 --> 00:51:46,813
And I'm gonna take matters
into my own hands."

504
00:51:46,987 --> 00:51:49,080
The kind of guy
you wouldn't even notice.

505
00:51:49,256 --> 00:51:52,054
Well, if that's true, he's getting better.

506
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:55,123
Yeah. Every bullet hit home.

507
00:52:06,072 --> 00:52:07,403
- Detective!
- Hey, detective!

508
00:52:07,574 --> 00:52:11,203
- Detective!
- Any leads, detective? Please.

509
00:52:12,312 --> 00:52:15,679
- Come on, step back!
- What about the bodies, detective?

510
00:52:15,849 --> 00:52:18,374
It's a new... It's a new investigation.

511
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:20,543
We haven't talked to anybody yet, no.

512
00:52:21,288 --> 00:52:22,983
It's a brand-new investigation.

513
00:52:23,156 --> 00:52:26,683
- Any suspects?
- No, we're not... I'm sorry, but we're not...

514
00:52:28,028 --> 00:52:29,962
Any leads? How many?

515
00:52:30,130 --> 00:52:31,722
Detective!

516
00:52:32,465 --> 00:52:33,864
Hey.

517
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:36,031
Excuse me, don't I know you?

518
00:52:36,203 --> 00:52:38,831
- No, I don't think we've met.
- Wait a minute. I know you.

519
00:52:39,005 --> 00:52:40,905
- No. You haven't. L...
- What's your name?

520
00:52:41,074 --> 00:52:43,736
My name's Erica Bain.
I do a radio show.

521
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:47,346
I don't know if you'd be interested in doing
an interview. I'd love to...

522
00:52:47,514 --> 00:52:49,709
I'm sorry.
We're not talking to the media now.

523
00:52:49,883 --> 00:52:52,408
I'm not that kind of media.
It would be about you.

524
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:54,213
My life's not that interesting.

525
00:52:55,522 --> 00:52:58,514
- Yeah, but the work you do is.
- No, thank you.

526
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:14,005
<i>So...</i>

527
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:17,441
<i>... you gonna give me some Radiohead</i>
<i>too?</i>

528
00:53:23,116 --> 00:53:25,880
<i>You ever been fucked by a knife?</i>

529
00:53:38,698 --> 00:53:40,563
How the hell did this get out so quick?

530
00:53:40,734 --> 00:53:45,228
Who knows? Coroner hates you,
people fucking technicians. Who knows?

531
00:53:45,972 --> 00:53:47,963
"Bloodbath."

532
00:53:49,175 --> 00:53:51,473
You ever listen to NKW?

533
00:53:51,645 --> 00:53:53,203
- What is that, like hip-hop?
- No.

534
00:53:55,248 --> 00:53:57,375
Remember a couple of months ago...

535
00:53:57,550 --> 00:54:00,519
...this girl and her boyfriend,
they got jacked in Central Park?

536
00:54:00,987 --> 00:54:04,684
- No. Which ones?
- Well, anyway, she has this radio show.

537
00:54:04,858 --> 00:54:07,759
- Right.
- She shows up at the subway last night...

538
00:54:07,928 --> 00:54:10,328
...and guess who she wants to interview?
- Me?

539
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:15,400
What, you? You should totally do it.
Remember that Bernie Goetz thing?

540
00:54:15,568 --> 00:54:16,592
Hey, is Carter in?

541
00:54:16,770 --> 00:54:19,500
Reporters calling in the night.
Reporters eat that shit up.

542
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:23,234
No, well, she's not that kind of reporter.
Yeah, well, have him call me.

543
00:54:23,410 --> 00:54:25,105
What is she?
Like a DJ or something?

544
00:54:25,278 --> 00:54:27,769
- No, she's just interesting, you know.
- Interesting?

545
00:54:27,948 --> 00:54:29,848
Have him call me at my desk.
It's Mercer.

546
00:54:30,016 --> 00:54:32,075
What's she want with you?
Give her my number.

547
00:54:32,385 --> 00:54:34,785
What's her precise street address?

548
00:54:34,955 --> 00:54:36,354
You know what I want?

549
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:38,684
I want everyone in the market
that night...

550
00:54:38,858 --> 00:54:42,658
...everyone on the subway, outside.
Everybody, I need them all brought in.

551
00:54:42,829 --> 00:54:45,161
Somebody has to have seen this guy.

552
00:54:45,332 --> 00:54:47,732
I need you to get the registration
off of this iPod.

553
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:50,393
- See who it belongs to.
- I'm on it.

554
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:57,237
You've been avoiding me.

555
00:54:57,410 --> 00:54:58,900
- No, I haven't.
- Yeah.

556
00:54:59,079 --> 00:55:02,515
You've been avoiding
the full glare of my disapproval.

557
00:55:02,682 --> 00:55:07,176
Yeah, well, it was... The show sucked
and everybody hated it. I'm sorry.

558
00:55:07,354 --> 00:55:10,721
Well, we don't normally do silence
on WNKW.

559
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:13,017
You almost managed a full minute.

560
00:55:13,193 --> 00:55:15,388
Well, I think I did
an okay recovery, so...

561
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:20,056
You got 11 more steps, do you?
Are they all gonna be on the air?

562
00:55:23,603 --> 00:55:28,336
I thought we were better than
some AM confessional...

563
00:55:28,508 --> 00:55:29,975
...but people are responding.

564
00:55:30,777 --> 00:55:35,237
I was wrong.
I'm big enough to admit it, so keep it up.

565
00:55:58,605 --> 00:56:00,334
Erica Bain?

566
00:56:02,042 --> 00:56:03,737
Erica Bain.

567
00:56:04,711 --> 00:56:07,043
I'm Detective Mercer. You...

568
00:56:09,315 --> 00:56:11,613
You remember me from last night?

569
00:56:13,486 --> 00:56:15,784
- Yeah.
- Yeah, well...

570
00:56:16,289 --> 00:56:20,191
...I saw you in the hospital after...

571
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:23,586
After what had happened
to you and to your friend.

572
00:56:25,698 --> 00:56:26,790
My friend?

573
00:56:26,966 --> 00:56:30,800
Yeah. I stopped by your room, you know,
because I recognized your name.

574
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:35,134
My wife, she used to listen to your show
all the time and...

575
00:56:35,442 --> 00:56:39,310
...that was why I stopped you
in the subway.

576
00:56:39,546 --> 00:56:41,138
I just wanted you to know that.

577
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:45,242
Thank you.

578
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:51,916
You know, it was disturbing.

579
00:56:53,059 --> 00:56:56,085
It really was. I mean, you were gone.

580
00:56:57,263 --> 00:57:00,323
And to see somebody...

581
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:03,158
...that can't see you, it...

582
00:57:04,037 --> 00:57:05,664
But you're back now.

583
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:09,206
Yeah, I'm back now.

584
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:11,809
A lot of people don't make it back.

585
00:57:13,113 --> 00:57:14,774
I know that.

586
00:57:15,782 --> 00:57:19,149
I know you do. You see...

587
00:57:19,819 --> 00:57:21,184
...I checked into your case.

588
00:57:21,354 --> 00:57:24,653
- You checked into my case?
- Yeah.

589
00:57:25,058 --> 00:57:28,550
We got two of the best detectives
in this city that's working on this...

590
00:57:28,728 --> 00:57:30,923
...and we will find them.

591
00:57:31,097 --> 00:57:32,462
We always do.

592
00:57:34,634 --> 00:57:37,535
Are policemen always so confident?

593
00:57:38,638 --> 00:57:40,196
Are you interviewing me now?

594
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:44,809
- Yeah, I guess I am.
- Right.

595
00:57:45,745 --> 00:57:46,837
Okay.

596
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:50,374
How long is this gonna take?

597
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:54,281
Five minutes, tops.
We can do it over here.

598
00:57:56,890 --> 00:57:58,221
Yeah.

599
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:04,188
When you first go to a crime scene...

600
00:58:04,397 --> 00:58:07,730
...what do you look for?
- Evidence.

601
00:58:08,234 --> 00:58:10,031
Okay, such as?

602
00:58:10,203 --> 00:58:12,171
Murder weapon, entry wound...

603
00:58:12,338 --> 00:58:16,001
...DNA samples, prints,
carbon fragments...

604
00:58:16,176 --> 00:58:17,973
...position of the corpse.

605
00:58:18,144 --> 00:58:21,045
It's amazing what a dead body
can tell you.

606
00:58:21,447 --> 00:58:23,244
So the dead do talk?

607
00:58:23,416 --> 00:58:25,816
Oh, yeah. Everybody talks.

608
00:58:25,985 --> 00:58:30,354
Now, most everybody lies.
But the dead can't.

609
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:34,784
And then again, the lies
tell you things too, because...

610
00:58:35,094 --> 00:58:37,426
...people tell them for a reason.

611
00:58:38,064 --> 00:58:42,091
And those bodies at the subway,
what are they telling you?

612
00:58:42,635 --> 00:58:44,569
You read the paper.

613
00:58:44,871 --> 00:58:46,805
Should I believe what I read?

614
00:58:52,278 --> 00:58:54,473
You ever read about him?

615
00:58:57,217 --> 00:58:58,514
Why do I know him?

616
00:58:58,685 --> 00:59:02,086
That's Mr. Murrow. He owns the parking
out on Roosevelt Island.

617
00:59:03,022 --> 00:59:05,217
But that's not all he does.

618
00:59:05,592 --> 00:59:07,219
What else does he do?

619
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:13,091
- You really wanna know?
- Yeah.

620
00:59:13,433 --> 00:59:14,832
Then this is off the record.

621
00:59:16,069 --> 00:59:17,468
Okay.

622
00:59:22,008 --> 00:59:26,308
He imports drugs, guns, people.
Whatever's in demand.

623
00:59:26,479 --> 00:59:28,413
Found three guys that had crossed him...

624
00:59:28,581 --> 00:59:32,881
...with their hands Superglued to a table
and expanding cement in their throats.

625
00:59:33,052 --> 00:59:35,111
Had his wife ready
to testify against him...

626
00:59:35,288 --> 00:59:38,382
...and then she's found with her brains
blown out, gun in her hand.

627
00:59:38,558 --> 00:59:40,685
Nothing adds up except his lawyers.

628
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:42,885
Now he's got custody
of his stepdaughter...

629
00:59:43,062 --> 00:59:45,394
...and not for sentimental reasons.

630
00:59:45,565 --> 00:59:47,999
But he knows she knows something...

631
00:59:48,167 --> 00:59:51,000
...and I hate to think what's
gonna happen to her. But...

632
00:59:51,904 --> 00:59:54,134
...maybe you know a nicer side.

633
00:59:58,845 --> 01:00:00,813
And why can't you nail him?

634
01:00:02,248 --> 01:00:03,840
Because I follow the law.

635
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:06,478
Well, there's nothing you can do?

636
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:08,815
Nothing that's legal.

637
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:13,553
I didn't say that.

638
01:00:14,127 --> 01:00:15,856
I didn't hear it.

639
01:00:16,856 --> 01:00:26,856
