1
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:29,660
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hey, Dad.

2
00:03:35,207 --> 00:03:37,198
I hit the Internet cafe.

3
00:03:37,309 --> 00:03:39,368
You know how many e-mails
I had in my box?

4
00:03:39,478 --> 00:03:40,877
Eighty-three.

5
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:43,812
- Oh, you're a popular guy.
- Very.

6
00:03:43,882 --> 00:03:47,249
Of course, 60 of them were ads
trying to get me to buy something.

7
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:48,980
Sarah, did you leave
these tools on the ground?

8
00:03:49,087 --> 00:03:50,315
I might have.

9
00:03:50,422 --> 00:03:52,720
Let's get them in the bag
and bring them in the house, please.

10
00:03:52,824 --> 00:03:54,985
We don't want it to rain on them.

11
00:03:56,928 --> 00:03:59,488
Oh, I checked your Facebook page.

12
00:04:01,066 --> 00:04:02,590
What's-his-name
wrote on your wall again.

13
00:04:02,667 --> 00:04:04,828
God, I should
never have added you.

14
00:04:06,738 --> 00:04:08,228
Yeah, he, um...

15
00:04:09,441 --> 00:04:11,238
...wants to get back together.

16
00:04:11,343 --> 00:04:12,901
Of course he does.

17
00:04:13,512 --> 00:04:15,912
I told you.
Princess, he doesn't deserve you.

18
00:04:23,588 --> 00:04:25,681
There you are.

19
00:04:25,757 --> 00:04:27,190
- And there you are.
- Here I am.

20
00:04:27,259 --> 00:04:28,590
Mm-hmm.

21
00:04:28,693 --> 00:04:30,684
Hey, uh, we have a problem.

22
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:33,364
- I've barely been gone an hour.
- What now?

23
00:04:33,465 --> 00:04:34,591
You'll see.

24
00:04:34,699 --> 00:04:36,530
- Great. Do I have to?
- Yeah.

25
00:04:38,804 --> 00:04:41,364
Hey, I was looking for you.
Did you go into town?

26
00:04:41,473 --> 00:04:42,963
- Mm-mm.
- I didn't think so.

27
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:44,531
- Where were you?
- Outside.

28
00:04:44,643 --> 00:04:46,440
Working very hard on the garden.

29
00:04:46,545 --> 00:04:47,944
Oh, we have a garden?

30
00:04:48,046 --> 00:04:49,775
Ahem. I had a headache.

31
00:04:49,881 --> 00:04:51,712
Haven't you heard that one before?

32
00:04:51,817 --> 00:04:53,216
I did!

33
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:54,548
I know, honey.

34
00:04:54,653 --> 00:04:55,950
You all better now?

35
00:04:56,054 --> 00:04:57,715
Yes. Thank you, Uncle Peter.

36
00:04:57,823 --> 00:04:59,051
So what is this big problem?

37
00:04:59,224 --> 00:05:01,385
All right, all right. This way.

38
00:05:03,462 --> 00:05:05,089
Why can't you just tell me about it?

39
00:05:05,163 --> 00:05:07,393
No, this is something
you have to see.

40
00:05:13,238 --> 00:05:16,674
I'll give you a hint. It's in here.

41
00:05:19,578 --> 00:05:21,569
Funny.

42
00:05:22,681 --> 00:05:24,672
What do you think?

43
00:05:27,085 --> 00:05:29,246
How are you supposed
to tell anything from that?

44
00:05:29,421 --> 00:05:30,911
What, you need binoculars,
old man?

45
00:05:31,022 --> 00:05:32,853
Just get your face up there.
Look in there.

46
00:05:32,924 --> 00:05:35,415
Okay. Oh.

47
00:05:35,494 --> 00:05:37,985
That's really... Is this necessary?

48
00:05:39,264 --> 00:05:40,925
I made a hole! What are you...?

49
00:05:42,267 --> 00:05:45,100
Are you impressed with your dad?
I'm impressed with your dad.

50
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:47,101
Now that, little brother,
is a hole.

51
00:05:47,272 --> 00:05:48,705
Nicely done.

52
00:05:51,943 --> 00:05:53,433
That is not good.

53
00:05:53,612 --> 00:05:55,204
No, not good.

54
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,838
- What is it?
- Oh, it's mould.

55
00:05:56,948 --> 00:05:59,883
Honey, you know what? I want you
to stand back. This is really bad.

56
00:05:59,951 --> 00:06:02,715
I don't want you breathing it in.
It can make you really sick.

57
00:06:02,787 --> 00:06:05,221
Just looking at it
is making me sick.

58
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:07,622
This whole house could be infected,
for all we know.

59
00:06:07,792 --> 00:06:09,783
Affected, not infected.

60
00:06:09,895 --> 00:06:11,385
Affected, infected, whatever.

61
00:06:11,463 --> 00:06:14,125
Well, if you cover it up,
who'll ever know, right?

62
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:15,359
That's true.

63
00:06:15,534 --> 00:06:18,128
Just a minute ago,
we had a tiny hole to deal with.

64
00:06:18,303 --> 00:06:19,861
Now we have a big hole.

65
00:06:19,971 --> 00:06:21,962
Well, the insurance'll cover it.

66
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,304
It's obviously part of the leak.

67
00:06:24,376 --> 00:06:26,503
Did you remember to bring the, um...?

68
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:29,203
- Boom!
- Ah, great minds think alike.

69
00:06:34,052 --> 00:06:36,077
So... what do you want to do?

70
00:06:36,154 --> 00:06:39,385
Why are you asking me?
We're outta here in a few days.

71
00:06:39,491 --> 00:06:42,051
Oh, okay. See here,
this is where it gets tricky.

72
00:06:43,929 --> 00:06:46,659
You're gonna dump
this whole thing on me.

73
00:06:46,731 --> 00:06:48,596
But it comes with the perk
of you not being here.

74
00:06:48,667 --> 00:06:50,157
So dare I complain?

75
00:06:50,335 --> 00:06:51,825
It's what you do best.

76
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,098
All right, I'll deal with it.

77
00:06:53,171 --> 00:06:55,571
Just don't give me shit later
when you find out how.

78
00:06:55,674 --> 00:06:58,108
Well, if you do it right the first time,
I won't have to.

79
00:06:58,176 --> 00:07:00,076
Have you checked the wall
all the way down to the basement?

80
00:07:00,178 --> 00:07:02,169
I just figured out
that it got down here.

81
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,838
Okay, come on.

82
00:07:04,849 --> 00:07:06,578
Bring the work light, please.

83
00:07:07,953 --> 00:07:09,511
Have fun.

84
00:07:18,296 --> 00:07:20,389
Uncle Peter, don't do that!

85
00:07:20,532 --> 00:07:23,399
Come on. You used to love that
when you were a little girl.

86
00:07:23,535 --> 00:07:25,025
Any day now!

87
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:28,562
I'm coming!

88
00:07:35,046 --> 00:07:36,741
How are you, Sarah?

89
00:07:37,882 --> 00:07:39,314
- I'm okay.
- Yeah?

90
00:07:39,383 --> 00:07:42,546
Yeah. How are you?

91
00:07:42,653 --> 00:07:44,314
Look at you.

92
00:07:45,255 --> 00:07:48,053
I can't get over
how grown up you are.

93
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:49,923
You gonna come down here,
or what?

94
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:52,255
Bite me! See you later.

95
00:08:24,695 --> 00:08:26,424
- Sarah?
- Yeah.

96
00:08:26,463 --> 00:08:28,863
Wow, I can't believe you're here!

97
00:08:33,103 --> 00:08:35,264
You don't remember me, do you?

98
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,465
I'm so embarrassed.

99
00:08:38,609 --> 00:08:40,975
I'm Sophia. We used to play together.

100
00:08:42,613 --> 00:08:45,275
Oh, of course. Yeah.

101
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:47,940
How are you?

102
00:08:48,052 --> 00:08:51,283
I'm quite good, actually,
especially now that I'm finding you here.

103
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:55,656
Why is it so dark in here?

104
00:08:55,793 --> 00:08:57,283
The power's out.

105
00:08:57,394 --> 00:09:00,227
My dad thinks rats
chewed through the wires.

106
00:09:00,297 --> 00:09:02,891
I'd invite you in, but there's...

107
00:09:03,067 --> 00:09:05,467
really no place to hang or anything.

108
00:09:05,569 --> 00:09:08,129
- That's okay.
- I can't stay long anyways.

109
00:09:10,641 --> 00:09:12,233
It's beautiful, isn't it?

110
00:09:14,812 --> 00:09:17,076
How long's it been
since you were out here?

111
00:09:17,147 --> 00:09:18,910
A long time, years.

112
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,514
Yeah. I come by once in a while,
and I've seen other people here,

113
00:09:22,653 --> 00:09:24,018
but never you.

114
00:09:24,154 --> 00:09:26,987
Yeah, other family
come out now and then,

115
00:09:27,091 --> 00:09:29,582
but no one's really been here
this last summer.

116
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,389
Well, except for the people

117
00:09:31,562 --> 00:09:34,759
who keep breaking in
and messing the place up.

118
00:09:34,832 --> 00:09:36,993
- That's terrible.
- Yeah.

119
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:38,831
Well, they broke almost all our windows.

120
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:41,997
My uncle had to call the police
to run them off and...

121
00:09:44,341 --> 00:09:46,172
So what are you doing here now?

122
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:49,171
Fixing it up. We're gonna sell it.

123
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,837
That's too bad.

124
00:09:52,382 --> 00:09:55,010
And aside from selling this house,
what are you up to?

125
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:58,078
Nothing much.

126
00:09:58,188 --> 00:10:00,122
Are you in school or something?

127
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:02,886
No, me and school
don't really go together.

128
00:10:04,027 --> 00:10:07,360
But I'm working for my dad
and thinking about doing something else.

129
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:10,727
Yeah, it's tough
getting any kind of job these days.

130
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:16,033
There's so many things I want to do,

131
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:19,065
but I never seem
to be able to do any of them.

132
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,206
Can you believe how long it's been?

133
00:10:25,649 --> 00:10:30,382
Remember when we used to play dress-up
and do makeovers?

134
00:10:30,487 --> 00:10:32,250
- Did we?
- Yeah.

135
00:10:32,389 --> 00:10:34,152
Oh, my God.

136
00:10:34,224 --> 00:10:36,215
It's been so long,
I swear, sometimes,

137
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,921
I think I have holes up here.

138
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:43,430
- I have a pile of photos around somewhere.
- I'll have to find them.

139
00:10:44,301 --> 00:10:45,893
Yeah.

140
00:10:47,771 --> 00:10:49,966
You always had the best hair.

141
00:10:54,311 --> 00:10:56,643
So how long are you around for?

142
00:10:56,747 --> 00:10:58,738
We've already been here a couple days,

143
00:10:58,782 --> 00:11:00,579
and my dad thinks
we're gonna head out soon.

144
00:11:00,651 --> 00:11:02,448
Really?

145
00:11:02,586 --> 00:11:05,077
Well, you maybe wanna hang out later?

146
00:11:06,156 --> 00:11:07,987
Yeah, that could be good.

147
00:11:10,327 --> 00:11:12,921
Oh, the phone lines
aren't set up, though,

148
00:11:13,096 --> 00:11:15,257
and our cells don't work up here.

149
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:18,264
It's okay, I'll just come by later.

150
00:11:19,436 --> 00:11:20,835
Okay.

151
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:24,770
I didn't know if I'd ever see you again.

152
00:11:26,443 --> 00:11:28,274
It's so good to see you.

153
00:11:28,345 --> 00:11:30,108
Yeah, it's good to see you, too.

154
00:11:31,949 --> 00:11:33,348
I'll see you later.

155
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:40,016
You know, I do remember you.

156
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:43,790
How could you forget?

157
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:48,325
See you later.

158
00:13:41,411 --> 00:13:43,572
John, if you care so much
about the way it's done,

159
00:13:43,613 --> 00:13:46,241
you can do it yourself, okay?
Just do it yourself.

160
00:13:47,317 --> 00:13:49,080
Just trying to be helpful.

161
00:13:49,152 --> 00:13:50,915
You're an asshole.

162
00:13:50,988 --> 00:13:53,456
- What? What'd I do now?
- Sorry. I gotta get outta here, Sarah.

163
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:57,157
Whoops.

164
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:59,421
Can I have the keys to my car, please?

165
00:14:00,597 --> 00:14:01,791
Uh...

166
00:14:01,932 --> 00:14:03,422
- You know where they are.
- Give me the keys.

167
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:04,934
When you're done
with your temper tantrums,

168
00:14:04,968 --> 00:14:06,458
see if you can get the electrician
on the phone, please.

169
00:14:06,636 --> 00:14:08,297
That would be awesome,
if he could come out here.

170
00:14:08,438 --> 00:14:11,635
We could use his needle-nose pliers
to get that stick out of your ass.

171
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,471
- What was that?
- I love you, brother.

172
00:14:21,785 --> 00:14:24,618
I don't know why my brother always
has to make everything so difficult.

173
00:14:25,622 --> 00:14:27,852
Yeah, when he doesn't do
what you want him to.

174
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:30,950
Exactly. You see,
if everyone would just do what I say,

175
00:14:31,028 --> 00:14:33,496
we wouldn't have any problems,
would we?

176
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:35,291
Uh-huh.

177
00:14:36,366 --> 00:14:39,164
- Do you need any help down there?
- No, it's okay.

178
00:14:39,302 --> 00:14:41,133
Okay.

179
00:16:25,241 --> 00:16:28,438
Hey. What are you doing?

180
00:16:29,245 --> 00:16:31,577
I just thought I heard something upstairs.

181
00:16:31,647 --> 00:16:33,410
It's probably the damn rats.

182
00:16:33,482 --> 00:16:35,074
God, don't remind me.

183
00:16:37,253 --> 00:16:39,744
No, it sounded like someone was up there.

184
00:16:40,923 --> 00:16:42,015
Maybe it's your uncle.

185
00:16:42,091 --> 00:16:43,581
No, his car's not here.

186
00:16:43,659 --> 00:16:46,787
I know how you think, sweetie.

187
00:16:46,929 --> 00:16:49,591
Would you like me to go upstairs
and have a look?

188
00:16:49,665 --> 00:16:51,758
- Yeah.
- Okay.

189
00:17:12,488 --> 00:17:14,786
Wait! I'm gonna come with you.

190
00:17:47,523 --> 00:17:49,184
Jesus!

191
00:17:49,325 --> 00:17:50,656
I get you?

192
00:17:50,726 --> 00:17:53,820
- Yeah, you did and that hurt.
- I'm sorry.

193
00:17:58,601 --> 00:18:00,159
What, you're trying to be funny?

194
00:18:00,336 --> 00:18:01,496
A little bit.

195
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:32,057
- What's that?
- Uh, it's just...

196
00:18:32,201 --> 00:18:36,194
It's just nothing.
It's photographs for the insurance.

197
00:18:37,706 --> 00:18:40,539
I don't know why your uncle
just leaves things laying around like this.

198
00:18:40,709 --> 00:18:42,301
Ridiculous.

199
00:19:00,763 --> 00:19:02,560
Sorry.

200
00:19:10,272 --> 00:19:13,901
Honey, you're gonna really have to start
making some progress in this room.

201
00:19:16,945 --> 00:19:18,606
You haven't even started on this closet.

202
00:19:18,747 --> 00:19:20,271
Most of it isn't mine.

203
00:19:21,283 --> 00:19:23,274
So, what, it's just gonna stay here?

204
00:19:26,188 --> 00:19:27,917
What are you doing in here?

205
00:19:34,029 --> 00:19:36,589
I don't know if you got the fact
that we're packing it up to get out?

206
00:19:36,699 --> 00:19:38,291
Yes, I do understand that.

207
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:40,267
That box is completely empty.

208
00:19:48,777 --> 00:19:50,802
If your cousins don't wanna help out,

209
00:19:50,946 --> 00:19:53,437
just keep what you want,
throw everything else out.

210
00:19:53,482 --> 00:19:55,279
Okay.

211
00:19:55,351 --> 00:19:58,514
- At least that's empty.
- Right, but what about the noise?

212
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:02,716
- Honey, it's an old house.
- They make noises.

213
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:04,622
I'm sure it's nothing.

214
00:20:05,494 --> 00:20:07,621
But I'll keep looking around, okay?

215
00:20:07,663 --> 00:20:08,994
Thank you.

216
00:20:09,965 --> 00:20:12,456
I want you to sit down,
go through that stuff,

217
00:20:12,501 --> 00:20:14,059
and start throwing things away.

218
00:20:14,136 --> 00:20:16,502
I wanna come back here
and see full garbage bags.

219
00:20:16,672 --> 00:20:17,661
- All right.
- You hear me?

220
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:18,968
Yes.

221
00:20:19,007 --> 00:20:21,976
All right. I'll be right back.

222
00:21:27,976 --> 00:21:29,534
Daddy?

223
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,643
Yeah?

224
00:21:33,715 --> 00:21:35,740
What's going on?

225
00:21:35,884 --> 00:21:37,875
Nothing's going on.

226
00:21:37,986 --> 00:21:39,886
What's going on in there?
Are you packing?

227
00:21:39,988 --> 00:21:41,751
Yeah, I'm throwing stuff out.

228
00:21:41,824 --> 00:21:43,553
Good. That's what I wanna hear.

229
00:22:16,425 --> 00:22:17,915
Dad?

230
00:22:41,116 --> 00:22:42,549
Daddy?

231
00:23:12,981 --> 00:23:14,573
Dad?

232
00:23:20,822 --> 00:23:22,255
Daddy?

233
00:24:22,883 --> 00:24:24,475
Daddy?

234
00:24:58,753 --> 00:25:00,118
Come on, Dad.

235
00:32:39,579 --> 00:32:42,776
Oh, my God.
Daddy, what have they done to you?

236
00:33:02,268 --> 00:33:03,895
Daddy.

237
00:33:08,274 --> 00:33:10,299
Daddy, wake up.

238
00:33:11,244 --> 00:33:13,075
Oh, my God.

239
00:33:16,249 --> 00:33:19,616
Wake up. Wake up!

240
00:33:26,659 --> 00:33:29,822
Oh, my God. You're alive.

241
00:33:39,772 --> 00:33:41,797
You're gonna be okay.

242
00:33:43,176 --> 00:33:44,939
You're gonna be okay.

243
00:33:45,011 --> 00:33:46,842
Oh, my God.

244
00:34:06,666 --> 00:34:08,998
Okay, the key. Where's the key?

245
00:34:36,162 --> 00:34:37,720
You're gonna be okay.

246
00:34:41,834 --> 00:34:43,665
I'm gonna come back.

247
00:34:53,346 --> 00:34:56,838
Daddy, hang on.
Okay, I'm gonna go get help.

248
00:44:40,164 --> 00:44:41,324
Sarah, what are you doing out here?

249
00:44:41,432 --> 00:44:43,491
- Why aren't you back at the house?
- Uncle Peter!

250
00:44:43,668 --> 00:44:44,794
Hey. Sarah.

251
00:44:44,969 --> 00:44:46,834
It's okay. Hey, what's going on?

252
00:44:47,004 --> 00:44:48,369
Sarah, tell me what's going on.

253
00:44:48,539 --> 00:44:49,631
They got Daddy!

254
00:44:49,774 --> 00:44:52,106
- Who got...?
- You have blood all over you.

255
00:44:52,176 --> 00:44:53,973
- What is going on, Sarah?
- They fucking killed him!

256
00:44:54,111 --> 00:44:55,442
Sarah, who hurt your dad?

257
00:44:55,513 --> 00:44:57,674
Somebody was back at the house? Who?

258
00:44:57,782 --> 00:44:59,841
There was just a girl.

259
00:44:59,951 --> 00:45:01,441
A girl? I don't see any girl.

260
00:45:01,485 --> 00:45:03,453
Sarah, you gotta tell me what's going on
so I can help you.

261
00:45:03,521 --> 00:45:05,512
What is going on?
Where is your dad?

262
00:45:05,623 --> 00:45:09,286
- He's at...
- He's in the room, on the floor.

263
00:45:09,327 --> 00:45:10,851
- Is he back at the house?
- Yeah.

264
00:45:10,962 --> 00:45:12,293
Okay.

265
00:45:12,330 --> 00:45:14,696
- Hey, where are you going?
- To get your dad.

266
00:45:14,799 --> 00:45:16,357
Are you fucking kidding me?!

267
00:45:16,467 --> 00:45:19,459
Uncle Peter, we need to go get help!

268
00:45:19,503 --> 00:45:21,494
If your dad is hurt,
we need to help him right now.

269
00:45:21,639 --> 00:45:23,664
We don't have any time
to go back into town, Sarah.

270
00:45:23,808 --> 00:45:24,797
No! Please!

271
00:45:24,842 --> 00:45:26,673
Tell me how many people
you saw back at the house.

272
00:45:26,811 --> 00:45:28,676
- I don't know!
- Just give me an idea. One, two, three?

273
00:45:28,846 --> 00:45:31,314
- Tell me what I'm dealing with here.
- There was one man...

274
00:45:31,382 --> 00:45:34,977
- Back at the house? - And then
there was just a girl by the road!

275
00:45:35,019 --> 00:45:36,646
Jesus, goddamn squatters.

276
00:45:36,687 --> 00:45:38,052
Please, stop!

277
00:45:38,155 --> 00:45:41,386
- It's okay, Sarah.
- I'm not gonna let anyone hurt you.

278
00:45:41,492 --> 00:45:42,857
I don't wanna be here!

279
00:45:42,927 --> 00:45:44,656
Sarah, come on, calm down.

280
00:45:44,896 --> 00:45:46,329
God...

281
00:45:47,899 --> 00:45:49,560
Here.

282
00:45:49,734 --> 00:45:51,668
Your wrist is bleeding.

283
00:45:52,703 --> 00:45:56,571
We'll tie this up first.
I got something here. C'mere.

284
00:45:56,674 --> 00:45:58,505
I'm sorry.

285
00:45:58,542 --> 00:46:00,032
I'm sorry. I know that hurts.

286
00:46:00,177 --> 00:46:02,077
All right, just put pressure on that.
Hold on to it.

287
00:46:02,179 --> 00:46:04,545
Sarah, honey, it's gonna be okay.
All right?

288
00:46:06,584 --> 00:46:07,846
Where are you going?

289
00:46:07,919 --> 00:46:10,217
- I'm gonna get your dad.
- Just stay in the car.

290
00:46:11,856 --> 00:46:14,188
- What are you doing?
- I'm getting my gun.

291
00:46:14,258 --> 00:46:16,055
- You can't leave me alone here!
- I'm gonna be right back!

292
00:46:16,193 --> 00:46:18,058
- Just stay in the car, Sarah!
- No!

293
00:46:18,195 --> 00:46:19,924
No!

294
00:46:20,031 --> 00:46:22,864
- Stay in the car and lock the doors.
- Lock it!

295
00:46:24,402 --> 00:46:25,426
All right.

296
00:49:06,030 --> 00:49:07,964
Uncle Peter!

297
00:49:19,210 --> 00:49:20,733
Uncle Peter?

298
00:50:17,834 --> 00:50:19,358
Jesus, Sarah!

299
00:50:20,670 --> 00:50:22,695
What are you doing?
I told you to stay in the car!

300
00:50:22,772 --> 00:50:25,263
- You left the trunk open!
- No, I didn't! I closed the trunk!

301
00:50:25,341 --> 00:50:27,502
Someone got in the car!

302
00:50:29,345 --> 00:50:30,937
What?

303
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:40,280
- You can't open it.
- I locked him out.

304
00:50:40,356 --> 00:50:41,618
No!

305
00:50:41,724 --> 00:50:43,214
- Do you have my key?
- Yeah, I'm not giving it-

306
00:50:43,293 --> 00:50:45,124
- Give me the key, Sarah!
- I'm not gonna give it to you!

307
00:50:45,228 --> 00:50:48,288
Please don't! I don't want to!

308
00:50:51,467 --> 00:50:53,799
- I don't wanna go out there.
- Okay. Okay...

309
00:50:53,970 --> 00:50:56,029
Okay...

310
00:50:56,372 --> 00:50:57,737
Okay.

311
00:51:06,482 --> 00:51:08,245
I'm sorry.

312
00:51:08,418 --> 00:51:10,318
I'm sorry about before. I didn't know.

313
00:51:11,421 --> 00:51:13,981
You all right? You sure?

314
00:51:14,090 --> 00:51:15,489
Yeah.

315
00:51:19,829 --> 00:51:22,423
Can you show me exactly
where you last saw your father?

316
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:27,233
I looked around,
but I didn't see anybody.

317
00:51:27,337 --> 00:51:29,737
I looked quick, but...
Here, take this.

318
00:51:32,175 --> 00:51:34,006
- How's your wrist?
- It's okay.

319
00:51:35,111 --> 00:51:37,773
All right, we're sticking together now.

320
00:51:37,847 --> 00:51:39,906
- What if he gets in the basement?
- Forget about it.

321
00:51:40,016 --> 00:51:41,677
We're gonna get your dad,
we're gonna get outta here.

322
00:51:41,784 --> 00:51:43,513
Get right behind me. C'mon.

323
00:51:45,588 --> 00:51:47,180
C'mon.

324
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:58,266
John?

325
00:52:11,881 --> 00:52:13,280
John?

326
00:52:46,416 --> 00:52:47,815
John?

327
00:52:49,919 --> 00:52:52,183
He wasn't in that room.

328
00:53:00,430 --> 00:53:02,022
Where was he?

329
00:53:04,934 --> 00:53:06,765
He was... in there.

330
00:53:13,609 --> 00:53:15,099
Okay.

331
00:53:16,612 --> 00:53:18,273
Let's look again.

332
00:53:48,811 --> 00:53:50,711
He was right here.

333
00:53:54,751 --> 00:53:56,582
Oh, Jesus.

334
00:54:06,095 --> 00:54:08,529
Sarah, how was your father
when you last left him?

335
00:54:08,598 --> 00:54:11,226
Could he have gotten up?
Could he have moved somewhere?

336
00:54:13,703 --> 00:54:15,762
I can't... see how.

337
00:54:21,411 --> 00:54:23,777
Okay, well, maybe he...

338
00:54:25,481 --> 00:54:27,415
Maybe he came to.

339
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:14,453
Uncle Peter?

340
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:19,424
Over here.

341
00:55:42,525 --> 00:55:45,426
I don't think there's anybody
on this floor.

342
00:55:50,199 --> 00:55:52,258
Yeah.

343
00:56:05,648 --> 00:56:07,513
Oh, man.

344
00:56:07,617 --> 00:56:09,949
What? What is that?

345
00:56:10,019 --> 00:56:11,680
Uh, it's...

346
00:56:12,822 --> 00:56:15,347
It's garbage. Here.

347
00:56:17,226 --> 00:56:19,319
Gotta get this outta here.

348
00:56:29,639 --> 00:56:31,334
Did you check upstairs?

349
00:56:34,043 --> 00:56:35,670
Quickly. Let's...

350
00:56:36,646 --> 00:56:38,136
Let's look again.

351
00:56:58,534 --> 00:57:00,866
Wait! Stay close to me.

352
00:57:03,906 --> 00:57:05,396
Give me your hand.

353
00:57:07,843 --> 00:57:09,504
It's okay.

354
00:57:12,348 --> 00:57:14,077
It's okay.

355
00:57:46,881 --> 00:57:48,041
What?

356
00:57:54,823 --> 00:57:56,484
What?

357
00:57:58,059 --> 00:58:00,050
That wasn't on before.

358
00:59:52,540 --> 00:59:54,201
They took him.

359
00:59:56,911 --> 00:59:59,573
I'm sorry, Sarah,
we looked everywhere.

360
01:00:08,022 --> 01:00:09,785
Uncle Peter.

361
01:00:10,358 --> 01:00:12,349
Uncle Peter...

362
01:00:12,527 --> 01:00:14,586
Uncle Peter!

363
01:02:42,043 --> 01:02:45,604
That's good. That's right.

364
01:02:47,282 --> 01:02:49,375
Just like that.

365
01:02:53,421 --> 01:02:55,286
Good. It's okay.

366
01:02:58,526 --> 01:03:02,087
Yeah. It's just a little game
we're playing.

367
01:03:06,734 --> 01:03:08,759
Nice.

368
01:03:09,570 --> 01:03:12,038
Don't be shy.

369
01:03:27,255 --> 01:03:28,654
Hmm.

370
01:03:31,459 --> 01:03:32,983
That wasn't so bad.

371
01:03:33,161 --> 01:03:35,254
Hmm? Was it?

372
01:03:41,135 --> 01:03:43,433
How about a little snack now?

373
01:10:01,448 --> 01:10:03,439
No!

374
01:10:17,797 --> 01:10:19,856
There you are.

375
01:10:19,966 --> 01:10:21,399
Sophia. What are you...?

376
01:10:21,468 --> 01:10:22,833
Thought we had a date, didn't we?

377
01:10:33,313 --> 01:10:35,304
Are you looking for this?

378
01:10:46,393 --> 01:10:48,725
That's not the key to this door.

379
01:10:49,496 --> 01:10:51,361
That's not the way out.

380
01:11:32,138 --> 01:11:34,038
Daddy? Daddy?

381
01:11:39,646 --> 01:11:41,204
What did you do to him?!

382
01:11:41,281 --> 01:11:42,714
Not nearly enough.

383
01:11:46,085 --> 01:11:48,383
Daddy want his favourite drink?

384
01:11:49,222 --> 01:11:51,713
No? I think he's gonna need it.

385
01:11:51,758 --> 01:11:54,556
- Who are you?
- Why are you doing this to us?

386
01:11:55,562 --> 01:11:57,962
You have trouble remembering, Sarah.

387
01:11:58,064 --> 01:11:59,895
You have holes up here.

388
01:12:13,813 --> 01:12:15,576
You have the key.

389
01:13:37,163 --> 01:13:38,824
Did I...?

390
01:13:41,367 --> 01:13:42,834
No...

391
01:13:45,004 --> 01:13:47,199
- Finish what you started.
- No.

392
01:13:51,210 --> 01:13:53,041
- Leave us alone!
- Ah!

393
01:13:54,180 --> 01:13:56,410
Stop punishing yourself, Sarah.

394
01:14:25,711 --> 01:14:27,542
- Sarah, plea...
- Shhh...

395
01:14:29,381 --> 01:14:33,750
You have to be quiet,
or you're gonna wake up Mommy.

396
01:14:33,885 --> 01:14:36,217
And then I'll have to punish you.

397
01:14:45,564 --> 01:14:47,998
So you want to play with me now?

398
01:14:48,166 --> 01:14:49,497
- Honey...
- Shhh!

399
01:14:51,069 --> 01:14:54,402
- Why are you making such a big deal?
- It's just a game. Don't be such a baby.

400
01:14:54,439 --> 01:14:56,304
Don't... Don't...

401
01:14:59,911 --> 01:15:02,903
Please stop! Please stop!

402
01:15:03,915 --> 01:15:06,076
Ow, Daddy, it hurts.

403
01:15:06,918 --> 01:15:09,614
It hurts.

404
01:15:09,755 --> 01:15:12,246
Daddy would never hurt you.

405
01:15:12,290 --> 01:15:14,155
Liar!

406
01:15:14,926 --> 01:15:18,953
Look. Look at what you did.
Look at what you did to me!

407
01:15:19,097 --> 01:15:21,088
How could you?!

408
01:15:26,338 --> 01:15:28,465
Look at what you did.

409
01:15:28,607 --> 01:15:29,972
Sarah... honey...

410
01:15:30,142 --> 01:15:32,975
you're seeing things...

411
01:15:34,179 --> 01:15:35,976
...people that aren't there.

412
01:15:36,114 --> 01:15:38,947
You're making things up that didn't happen.

413
01:15:40,986 --> 01:15:43,784
But we can get through this, baby.

414
01:15:44,289 --> 01:15:47,315
You're gonna have to do what I say.
Okay?

415
01:15:47,492 --> 01:15:51,656
I can help you,
but you're gonna have to untie me first.

416
01:15:54,700 --> 01:15:56,531
Sweetie...

417
01:15:58,470 --> 01:15:59,869
Honey?

418
01:16:03,308 --> 01:16:05,674
It's okay. It's okay.

419
01:16:06,678 --> 01:16:08,976
Come on. That's right.

420
01:16:13,652 --> 01:16:16,212
Just take it easy.
Just take it easy.

421
01:16:16,488 --> 01:16:19,048
Oh, God. Thank you.

422
01:16:19,691 --> 01:16:21,818
Now just give these to me.

423
01:16:22,694 --> 01:16:24,662
All right. All right.

424
01:16:28,667 --> 01:16:30,328
Okay.

425
01:16:35,741 --> 01:16:37,834
Honey, it's all right.

426
01:16:39,177 --> 01:16:41,737
It's okay. It's okay.

427
01:16:42,547 --> 01:16:44,674
All right. You okay?

428
01:17:02,434 --> 01:17:05,426
No, Daddy! Ow!

429
01:17:05,871 --> 01:17:08,032
- You're making me do this, Sarah.
- No!

430
01:17:13,245 --> 01:17:14,769
John...

431
01:17:23,555 --> 01:17:25,455
Just leave her alone.

432
01:17:26,591 --> 01:17:28,218
Leave her alone?

433
01:17:34,599 --> 01:17:36,430
Just shut up, Peter.

434
01:17:36,568 --> 01:17:40,231
Shut up and enjoy the show, huh?

435
01:17:40,272 --> 01:17:42,604
Just like you always did. Huh?

436
01:17:42,741 --> 01:17:44,732
- Right, Sarah?
- Let her go!

437
01:17:46,578 --> 01:17:48,307
"Let her go. " What is this, a joke?

438
01:17:48,814 --> 01:17:50,247
Ah! Ah!

439
01:17:50,615 --> 01:17:53,140
You're such a loser.

440
01:17:56,288 --> 01:17:57,983
Pretending to be dead.

441
01:17:58,156 --> 01:18:00,420
And then you attack me?

442
01:18:08,934 --> 01:18:11,300
This'll be our special little secret.

443
01:18:20,612 --> 01:18:22,136
Oh, God.

444
01:18:23,114 --> 01:18:25,014
Oh, God, Sarah. Please.

445
01:18:25,784 --> 01:18:27,684
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

446
01:18:28,620 --> 01:18:30,850
It was so long ago.

447
01:18:30,956 --> 01:18:34,187
I should've stopped it,
I should've stopped him.
