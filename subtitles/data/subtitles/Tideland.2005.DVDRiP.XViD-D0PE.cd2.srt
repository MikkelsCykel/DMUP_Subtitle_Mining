You love, Dickens?

2
00:00:38,929 --> 00:00:40,270
No I don't.

3
00:00:40,496 --> 00:00:44,324
You want to kiss the cut on his head
and hold hands.

4
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:46,923
But, he's a sissy.

5
00:00:47,148 --> 00:00:50,343
He's a shark hunter.
He has a submarine too.

6
00:00:50,539 --> 00:00:52,294
Except it's a fake.

7
00:00:52,489 --> 00:00:55,303
He's gonna be rich and buy a real one.

8
00:00:55,496 --> 00:00:58,309
He has more pennies than you.

9
00:00:59,014 --> 00:01:02,754
Hey, wait for me.
That monster shark might be about.

10
00:01:02,948 --> 00:01:06,688
Don't worry.
Dickens the sea captain will save us.

11
00:01:07,266 --> 00:01:09,948
He's sailing under the seas now.

12
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,010
He's diving deep to the place
where dreams are made.

13
00:01:14,206 --> 00:01:19,059
"He walks a lonely shore all littered
with dreams and hopes..."

14
00:01:19,931 --> 00:01:23,507
Dickens, my brave sea captain.

15
00:01:34,771 --> 00:01:37,584
Avast ye, you scurvy...

16
00:01:37,905 --> 00:01:41,035
I'll have you keelhauled.

17
00:01:41,264 --> 00:01:45,571
I'll have you strung to the yard arm
and sent to Davey Jones's locker!

18
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:48,193
- Have mercy on my soul!
- Mutiny.

19
00:01:48,395 --> 00:01:52,800
Looks like the pirate took
the captain prisoner.

20
00:01:53,673 --> 00:01:58,526
- Mercy.
- Those who die will be the lucky ones!

21
00:02:01,892 --> 00:02:04,608
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

22
00:02:04,866 --> 00:02:08,312
Wait a minute,
he looks more like a farmer.

23
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,098
He's not really a captain...

24
00:02:12,286 --> 00:02:16,114
- or a prisoner or anything.
- Go on in, Dickens.

25
00:02:16,317 --> 00:02:20,570
- Stay in your room till I call you out.
- Okay, Dell, okay.

26
00:02:23,129 --> 00:02:25,583
Afternoon, Miss Munro.

27
00:02:26,167 --> 00:02:27,660
Hello, Patrick.

28
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:33,042
Is it afternoon?
My, how the day flies, you know.

29
00:02:33,747 --> 00:02:36,167
"My, how the day flies you know."

30
00:02:39,088 --> 00:02:41,705
I do appreciate all you do for me,
Patrick.

31
00:02:42,606 --> 00:02:45,736
You are such a kind young man.

32
00:02:46,828 --> 00:02:50,470
- Well, I always try...
- I know.

33
00:02:50,986 --> 00:02:53,057
I know. Now, Patrick...

34
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,700
these deliveries...
they is all paid for, ain't they?

35
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:59,807
Sure.

36
00:03:01,412 --> 00:03:02,938
Thank you.

37
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:06,711
Are you...

38
00:03:07,009 --> 00:03:08,634
are you go...

39
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,679
will you...

40
00:03:12,222 --> 00:03:13,497
I will.

41
00:03:14,748 --> 00:03:17,780
I will... but not here.

42
00:03:18,746 --> 00:03:20,436
Not in the yard...

43
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:22,837
not by the tomatoes.

44
00:04:06,241 --> 00:04:08,128
It's a zoo room.

45
00:04:08,672 --> 00:04:11,572
It stinks of disinfectant.

46
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,613
Miss Munro.

47
00:04:28,757 --> 00:04:30,414
What are they doing?

48
00:04:30,963 --> 00:04:33,417
She's touching his boy-thing.

49
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:37,194
It's gone all angry and red!

50
00:04:37,488 --> 00:04:39,626
She's kissing it!

51
00:04:41,869 --> 00:04:44,421
She's sucking his blood!

52
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,322
- He's trying to call for help.
- She's a vampire.

53
00:04:57,925 --> 00:04:59,102
You're next.

54
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:04,825
Oh, shit. Why'd you stop, Miss Mun...

55
00:05:20,089 --> 00:05:23,218
We're safe. We escaped.

56
00:05:25,206 --> 00:05:27,855
I thought she was gonna be my friend.

57
00:05:29,843 --> 00:05:34,216
Say... isn't that the rabbit hole you found?

58
00:05:36,496 --> 00:05:38,666
It looks bigger than before.

59
00:05:40,302 --> 00:05:42,210
Maybe I could crawl in.

60
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:45,674
I want to look in. Show me.

61
00:05:47,499 --> 00:05:49,407
Okay. All right.

62
00:05:56,901 --> 00:05:58,688
Mustique!

63
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:01,730
I'm falling very slowly, dear.

64
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:06,806
The sides of the holes are filled
with cupboards and book-shelves.

65
00:06:07,711 --> 00:06:08,888
Can you hear me?

66
00:06:09,886 --> 00:06:12,503
No, don't listen to her!

67
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,478
She's gone, Jeliza-Rose.

68
00:06:15,707 --> 00:06:21,933
It's too dangerous to rescue Mustique.
You have to face up to it.

69
00:06:23,095 --> 00:06:25,515
Take that! She's not dead yet.

70
00:06:26,101 --> 00:06:28,555
You just wanna take her place.

71
00:06:29,907 --> 00:06:31,314
You're all traitors.

72
00:06:31,826 --> 00:06:36,047
You don't have hearts.
You're just heads!

73
00:06:37,807 --> 00:06:39,911
- And you too!
- No, no.

74
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:44,264
Jeliza-Rose, please.
I want to help save Mustique.

75
00:06:44,491 --> 00:06:49,311
I truly do. Because of my eyes,
I can sense things in the dark.

76
00:06:50,472 --> 00:06:52,544
You're better than those other two.

77
00:06:53,766 --> 00:06:56,961
I'm sorry Mustique was so mean to you.

78
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:05,430
I'm almost a ghost.

79
00:07:06,528 --> 00:07:09,210
That's why Dell didn't see me.

80
00:07:10,877 --> 00:07:12,819
I really think I am...

81
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,393
don't you?

82
00:07:14,587 --> 00:07:19,124
I really can't say, Jeliza-Rose.
I don't know about those things.

83
00:07:25,876 --> 00:07:27,730
Come in, Mustique.

84
00:07:28,627 --> 00:07:29,837
Are you there?

85
00:07:30,994 --> 00:07:32,237
Can you hear me?

86
00:07:33,105 --> 00:07:35,438
This is radio Jeliza-Rose.

87
00:07:36,687 --> 00:07:39,816
Am I loud and clear?
Come in, please.

88
00:07:41,005 --> 00:07:42,346
Over.

89
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:09,212
Dickens?

90
00:08:09,981 --> 00:08:11,703
Thought you was a squirrel.

91
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,368
He's spoiled.

92
00:08:15,866 --> 00:08:17,621
He's cutting muffins, is all.

93
00:08:18,808 --> 00:08:24,402
I guess that's what it is... I guess.
Whatever it is.

94
00:08:24,821 --> 00:08:27,208
Your daddy sleeps a lot.

95
00:08:27,732 --> 00:08:31,046
- My mama does too.
- Is she a ghost?

96
00:08:31,697 --> 00:08:34,859
No, not any more. Not really.

97
00:08:35,088 --> 00:08:36,777
She's just a dozer.

98
00:08:37,294 --> 00:08:40,107
She isn't as pretty as your daddy.

99
00:08:40,428 --> 00:08:43,427
Her hair isn't nice like his is.

100
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:45,865
It's only fake.

101
00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:46,985
See.

102
00:08:50,439 --> 00:08:53,820
That's funny.
You fooled me because I didn't know.

103
00:08:54,053 --> 00:08:56,124
It's not supposed to be funny.

104
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:00,122
It was Mustique's idea.

105
00:09:01,633 --> 00:09:04,860
Dickens... will you help me
save my friend?

106
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:09,690
She may be dying.
She's farther than the ocean, I think.

107
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,440
I probably can't do it.

108
00:09:16,793 --> 00:09:18,897
But you're the captain!

109
00:09:19,095 --> 00:09:23,533
Yeah, I am.
Because I've got my own submarine.

110
00:09:24,277 --> 00:09:27,919
Can we feed the shark?
I'd like to do that.

111
00:09:28,531 --> 00:09:33,165
If you want you can help me too.
We can lure it.

112
00:09:33,487 --> 00:09:35,309
Meaner than death.

113
00:09:35,535 --> 00:09:37,868
Okay, I'll help you.

114
00:09:39,148 --> 00:09:41,252
Then you'll rescue my friend?

115
00:09:42,763 --> 00:09:43,624
Yeah.

116
00:09:45,802 --> 00:09:47,230
What'll happen?

117
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:52,481
The end of the world.

118
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:55,099
The monster shark will die?

119
00:09:57,027 --> 00:09:59,481
The monster shark never dies.

120
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:11,126
Bad dog.

121
00:10:11,835 --> 00:10:14,648
You watered all the fish and seaweeds.

122
00:10:15,321 --> 00:10:17,262
Bad dog!

123
00:10:17,496 --> 00:10:20,658
- You're the bad dog.
- No, you're the bad dog.

124
00:10:21,334 --> 00:10:25,456
- You're a bad dog!
- You're a bad dog for looking.

125
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,113
We better go.

126
00:10:28,371 --> 00:10:31,271
If the monster shark catches us here,
we're doomed.

127
00:10:32,623 --> 00:10:33,703
Monster shark!

128
00:10:34,032 --> 00:10:38,502
Monster shark. Gonna kill you.
It's gonna eat you.

129
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:41,067
The bus! We can hide there.

130
00:10:41,643 --> 00:10:45,286
No, that's a bad place.
It's wrong there.

131
00:10:45,513 --> 00:10:47,399
No. Come on!

132
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:50,044
Can't go there.

133
00:10:50,918 --> 00:10:55,705
You use the bus for shark bait
and it tips over and burns up.

134
00:10:56,707 --> 00:10:58,430
And then you get in trouble.

135
00:10:58,594 --> 00:11:02,552
And Officer Waller said "You can't
drive a bus on the tracks, Dickens...

136
00:11:02,752 --> 00:11:07,288
you should know that.
That'll get you sent away, Dickens."

137
00:11:07,485 --> 00:11:09,873
So I can't go there with you.

138
00:11:11,131 --> 00:11:13,203
I can't go there with you.

139
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:16,789
Captain, you're acting wei...

140
00:11:16,984 --> 00:11:18,412
- silly - Can't go.

141
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:22,834
Sometimes you just worry about it
too much.

142
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:27,183
Just pretend it never happened, okay?

143
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:31,983
I better go home now and eat, I think.

144
00:11:32,111 --> 00:11:34,565
Maybe we can find some food together.

145
00:11:35,342 --> 00:11:38,122
We shouldn't play no more today.

146
00:11:39,244 --> 00:11:43,333
You have to save my friend.
You said you'd do that.

147
00:11:43,593 --> 00:11:48,773
I don't know, because I make mistakes
if I try some things.

148
00:11:49,479 --> 00:11:51,485
But you have to.

149
00:11:53,061 --> 00:11:55,394
You promised.

150
00:11:56,803 --> 00:11:58,525
What is your friend?

151
00:11:58,722 --> 00:11:59,736
A head.

152
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:03,068
- A doll's head.
- Does she bite?

153
00:12:03,263 --> 00:12:04,310
No.

154
00:12:05,022 --> 00:12:07,160
Her mouth is like this.

155
00:12:11,131 --> 00:12:12,985
She doesn't have teeth.

156
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:16,307
All right. Okay.

157
00:12:24,531 --> 00:12:28,936
Wait! I got her. It has to be her.

158
00:12:29,137 --> 00:12:32,102
- It has to be.
- Yeah, it has to be!

159
00:12:37,612 --> 00:12:39,400
No, it's weird.

160
00:12:40,906 --> 00:12:44,450
It's not a head at all,
it's not like what you said.

161
00:12:44,904 --> 00:12:47,772
And that's all that's down there, okay?

162
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:50,875
There's nothing but dirt and more dirt.

163
00:12:51,269 --> 00:12:52,730
She's dead.

164
00:12:58,081 --> 00:13:00,600
I can feel something coming.

165
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:06,041
It's the monster shark!
He's coming for the bait!

166
00:13:07,932 --> 00:13:11,029
- Look out!
- Wait! Where are you going?

167
00:13:13,081 --> 00:13:15,284
Dickens! Dickens!

168
00:13:16,055 --> 00:13:17,364
Dickens!

169
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:20,494
Damn you. Trouble-maker!

170
00:13:20,725 --> 00:13:22,731
Vandal!

171
00:13:35,693 --> 00:13:39,368
Hold on, Jeliza-Rose. We're coming.

172
00:13:39,595 --> 00:13:40,674
Come on, hurry up.

173
00:13:42,442 --> 00:13:44,328
Is she dead?

174
00:13:46,215 --> 00:13:48,189
I can't be sure.

175
00:13:48,518 --> 00:13:51,331
Look, she's breathing.

176
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:57,821
She's weak. And must be pretty hungry,
pretty thirsty too.

177
00:13:58,368 --> 00:14:00,538
What's that?

178
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:04,856
Smells like disinfectant.

179
00:14:05,532 --> 00:14:09,491
- Look, I try to be good, okay.
- Dickens...

180
00:14:09,786 --> 00:14:12,883
And I'll get the boy.

181
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,075
Where are you going, Jeliza-Rose?

182
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:20,814
Don't go downstairs. Dell's there.

183
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:23,313
Don't go, Jeliza-Rose.

184
00:14:23,827 --> 00:14:26,956
I wish Mustique were here.

185
00:14:27,185 --> 00:14:30,086
Don't cry. Mustique's gone forever.

186
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,667
Don't go downstairs. I'm afraid.

187
00:14:33,933 --> 00:14:37,193
- You're always crying.
- Baby.

188
00:14:37,867 --> 00:14:40,005
- I'm not a baby.
- You act like one.

189
00:14:40,425 --> 00:14:41,734
Cry baby.

190
00:14:41,961 --> 00:14:47,108
Cry, cry baby, cry baby.

191
00:14:48,582 --> 00:14:50,915
Maybe you two want to come with me?

192
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,433
Well, you're coming anyhow.

193
00:14:55,777 --> 00:14:58,842
Please don't go, Jeliza-Rose.

194
00:14:59,711 --> 00:15:02,644
What is that terrible smell?

195
00:15:03,326 --> 00:15:04,786
I told you...

196
00:15:05,276 --> 00:15:07,163
disinfectant.

197
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:13,358
What can she be doing down there?

198
00:15:14,871 --> 00:15:16,245
I don't know.

199
00:15:17,782 --> 00:15:19,058
We'll find out.

200
00:15:34,093 --> 00:15:36,809
To meet again like this...

201
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:40,935
I won't let you go though. Not again.

202
00:15:43,751 --> 00:15:45,725
No more running away.

203
00:15:49,445 --> 00:15:51,865
I love you so much.

204
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:01,308
There's so much damage done already.

205
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:03,836
But I'll save what's left. Oh, I will.

206
00:16:04,252 --> 00:16:05,680
Put this there.

207
00:16:08,379 --> 00:16:11,726
- Who welcomed you down here, child?
- Not me, Dell, I didn't!

208
00:16:13,655 --> 00:16:14,637
Not me.

209
00:16:16,822 --> 00:16:19,025
Wigs and blush, they won't cut it, child.

210
00:16:19,252 --> 00:16:22,218
You can stay and watch if you must,
but you be quiet or else.

211
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,064
Now I want to chill him.

212
00:16:29,871 --> 00:16:31,560
What a mess.

213
00:16:35,596 --> 00:16:38,529
This isn't fun. This is a sad man.

214
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:41,150
This a sad, sad man.

215
00:16:41,704 --> 00:16:42,652
Now...

216
00:16:48,677 --> 00:16:50,531
Sinister apples.

217
00:16:50,787 --> 00:16:53,372
Sinister, sinister apples.

218
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:57,822
I'm tired, I'm tired, tired, tired.

219
00:16:58,047 --> 00:17:00,534
See the skin has to be peeled.

220
00:17:00,734 --> 00:17:02,260
And then the fat trimmed...

221
00:17:02,461 --> 00:17:05,689
and the bones, they get sprinkled
with powdered Borax...

222
00:17:05,915 --> 00:17:08,947
then the shaping of the wire begins...

223
00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:12,023
and the mending,
the sewing, the varnishing...

224
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:19,722
Rose.

225
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:22,158
Rose.

226
00:17:24,178 --> 00:17:25,933
Arise, Rose...

227
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,334
and behold Noah.

228
00:17:30,638 --> 00:17:34,597
- Is he all better now?
- Course he's better, course he is.

229
00:17:36,011 --> 00:17:37,700
Are you gonna give him something?

230
00:17:38,601 --> 00:17:40,869
A gift for his new life.

231
00:17:41,896 --> 00:17:43,935
- Like what?
- Oh, I don't know.

232
00:17:44,167 --> 00:17:47,427
You have to choose. It has to be
something dear to you, though.

233
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:55,165
- No, not me!
- No, not me.

234
00:17:55,393 --> 00:17:58,293
- No, don't. Oh, please. Please!
- Don't, Jeliza-Rose... I'm scared.

235
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:03,377
Not me! Jeliza-Rose, I'm your friend.

236
00:18:03,644 --> 00:18:05,017
Jeliza-Rose!

237
00:18:05,275 --> 00:18:06,584
- Goodbye. - No.

238
00:18:08,474 --> 00:18:10,131
Have a nice trip.

239
00:18:11,831 --> 00:18:14,797
Jeliza-Rose, get me out.

240
00:18:15,126 --> 00:18:20,589
- We're so afraid!
- Somebody save me. Help!

241
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:23,657
Can anyone hear me? Help!

242
00:18:25,552 --> 00:18:27,917
You brought Noah back to me.

243
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:31,461
So we'll share him now.

244
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:36,097
But you're his.

245
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:38,689
You understand, child?

246
00:18:49,443 --> 00:18:51,994
Go to the porch, draw in,
it's the fumes.

247
00:18:52,962 --> 00:18:54,815
It's unhealthy for your lungs.

248
00:18:55,743 --> 00:18:57,052
Go on, get!

249
00:19:17,236 --> 00:19:18,926
It's a new day.

250
00:19:20,978 --> 00:19:22,636
We'll get your house in order.

251
00:19:22,865 --> 00:19:25,165
An untidy home means an untidy person.

252
00:19:27,982 --> 00:19:30,370
Monster! You nasty thing!

253
00:19:33,163 --> 00:19:34,340
Nasty thing.

254
00:19:36,106 --> 00:19:38,952
Come on, things to do.
Come on. Up. Up!

255
00:19:41,255 --> 00:19:42,182
Dickens.

256
00:19:44,677 --> 00:19:46,814
- Gotta clean, clean, clean.
- Clean, clean, clean.

257
00:19:50,242 --> 00:19:52,248
Wash me in the blood of Jesus

258
00:19:52,513 --> 00:19:55,926
And clean the tarnished soul

259
00:19:56,927 --> 00:20:00,187
He will heal me
Make me whole

260
00:20:00,413 --> 00:20:01,361
Wipe it!

261
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:06,612
Rise and shine

262
00:20:06,842 --> 00:20:10,418
Rise and shine

263
00:20:10,647 --> 00:20:15,663
We'll rise and shine with Jesus
In my new home in the sky

264
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:18,445
With loaves and fish He'll feed us

265
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:21,040
His pierced hands will lead us

266
00:20:21,297 --> 00:20:26,477
And we'll rise and shine with Jesus
in the sky

267
00:20:26,735 --> 00:20:29,123
Now when we get to heaven

268
00:20:29,389 --> 00:20:31,941
That sin'll be all compared

269
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:36,993
And angel's wings we're given
as we climb them golden stairs

270
00:20:37,193 --> 00:20:40,453
I'm gonna strip off
and put on a pure white robe

271
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:42,850
Scrub clean my sinful soul

272
00:20:43,046 --> 00:20:45,598
So wash me in the blood

273
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:51,934
Wash me in the blood of Jesus

274
00:20:53,408 --> 00:20:54,389
Now...

275
00:20:56,031 --> 00:20:58,964
seal your eyes and mouth,
extend your arms and hold your breath.

276
00:21:02,363 --> 00:21:04,304
Do your panties.

277
00:21:06,457 --> 00:21:10,132
Beer braised rabbit with carrots
and onions and potatoes.

278
00:21:10,391 --> 00:21:13,488
A jar of lemonade and butter tarts
for dessert.

279
00:21:14,037 --> 00:21:17,264
Fruits of Eden all for the children of Noah.

280
00:21:21,169 --> 00:21:22,598
Jeliza-Rose...

281
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,326
this is where you belong...

282
00:21:25,199 --> 00:21:28,514
Jeliza... this is where you belong.
You're part...

283
00:21:29,229 --> 00:21:32,129
you're part of the family now,
you hear me?

284
00:21:32,363 --> 00:21:34,783
We cannot have any strangers here.

285
00:21:34,954 --> 00:21:37,408
They'd take daddy away from us.
Do you hear me?

286
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:43,236
Dear Lord...

287
00:21:44,772 --> 00:21:48,545
I hold up a hand to Death.
I keep that troublesome stranger away.

288
00:21:48,866 --> 00:21:50,556
- That is my calling. - Hallelujah.

289
00:21:50,753 --> 00:21:53,981
When you love something,
it doesn't have to die or go in the ground.

290
00:21:54,207 --> 00:21:58,841
Nothing has to change, for I am
the keeper of the silent souls. Amen.

291
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:00,442
Amen.

292
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:04,368
Now, eat. Stuff yourselves.

293
00:22:04,634 --> 00:22:05,745
Yeah.

294
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:11,567
He's good.

295
00:22:12,981 --> 00:22:14,988
I waited for you for so long.

296
00:22:15,475 --> 00:22:16,751
And now...

297
00:22:17,203 --> 00:22:19,885
after all these years, to have you here...

298
00:22:20,465 --> 00:22:21,806
I love gravy.

299
00:22:22,064 --> 00:22:24,812
- You won't be leaving me again.
- Lemonade.

300
00:22:25,615 --> 00:22:28,101
You'll be staying put for a long while.

301
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:35,812
He looks like a burrito.

302
00:22:36,201 --> 00:22:37,793
Sleep of the just.

303
00:22:40,615 --> 00:22:44,835
Did you ever know the old lady?
Rose, you ever know your grandma?

304
00:22:45,444 --> 00:22:48,289
She died when I wasn't even born yet.

305
00:22:49,505 --> 00:22:53,878
You missed a saint.
I owe her my life.

306
00:22:54,111 --> 00:22:57,458
She tended my sorry body
after that bee darn near killed me.

307
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:02,553
Nasty, nasty bees.

308
00:23:03,545 --> 00:23:06,991
Nasty...

309
00:23:07,287 --> 00:23:09,653
buzzy bees.

310
00:23:10,326 --> 00:23:11,569
Course I...

311
00:23:11,829 --> 00:23:15,504
I can see more than most,
even with my eyes closed.

312
00:23:15,699 --> 00:23:16,647
Yes.

313
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:19,366
I can see birds and...

314
00:23:19,633 --> 00:23:22,217
rabbits and...

315
00:23:24,591 --> 00:23:28,200
curious little girls hiding behind bushes.

316
00:23:32,937 --> 00:23:35,489
I can see everything you can imagine.

317
00:23:38,151 --> 00:23:39,524
Course...

318
00:23:40,517 --> 00:23:43,745
curious little girls hiding behind bushes...

319
00:23:44,004 --> 00:23:46,490
sometimes see more than they should.

320
00:23:47,937 --> 00:23:50,554
Best minding one's own business,
you hear me?

321
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:54,169
Otherwise, Rose,
bad things might happen.

322
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:57,785
Bad, bad things might happen
under the sun.

323
00:24:03,193 --> 00:24:06,323
You smell awful.
You reek of the devil, Rose!

324
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:15,050
You're dead.

325
00:24:17,138 --> 00:24:19,340
You finished making that trap, Dickens?

326
00:24:20,016 --> 00:24:20,964
Dickens!

327
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:25,604
Nasty.

328
00:24:26,221 --> 00:24:27,300
Diseased.

329
00:24:39,078 --> 00:24:40,900
Come on, hurry up now, Dickens.

330
00:24:42,244 --> 00:24:43,226
Nasty.

331
00:25:26,828 --> 00:25:28,616
Sateen Lips?

332
00:25:30,027 --> 00:25:31,586
Baby Blonde?

333
00:25:35,016 --> 00:25:37,829
- Are you there?
- Yeah, hallelujah.

334
00:25:39,141 --> 00:25:44,289
Behold brothers and sisters,
she's been washed in the blood of Jesus.

335
00:25:44,482 --> 00:25:46,815
A full recovery is expected.

336
00:25:47,106 --> 00:25:51,064
I've never been so happy.
I'm alive!

337
00:25:51,775 --> 00:25:55,002
Jeliza-Rose, you know I love you,
don't you?

338
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,462
Honey, I'm sorry.

339
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:59,382
I'll do something nice for you soon.

340
00:25:59,611 --> 00:26:01,584
- I promise, baby.
- Hallelujah. She's born again.

341
00:26:02,297 --> 00:26:06,867
- Jesus is giving her a new brain.
- Have some chocolate.

342
00:26:07,062 --> 00:26:10,060
Wash me in the blood

343
00:26:10,325 --> 00:26:12,462
Rise and shine, dear.

344
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:18,671
Mustique's alive!

345
00:26:19,023 --> 00:26:21,772
She's okay and happy.

346
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:24,004
Just a dream. Trust me.

347
00:26:24,237 --> 00:26:27,235
- I know everything.
- Stop it.

348
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:30,054
Stop pretending you're her.

349
00:26:30,314 --> 00:26:33,214
I have no idea what you're talking about.

350
00:26:33,416 --> 00:26:35,902
It's not just a dream!

351
00:26:40,485 --> 00:26:44,411
That's what you get! You're a bad dog!

352
00:26:57,883 --> 00:26:59,857
Hi, Jeliza-Rose.

353
00:27:00,122 --> 00:27:04,342
I better go because I didn't knock
and that's rude. So I'll go, okay?

354
00:27:05,815 --> 00:27:08,235
I didn't knock, so I'll go, okay?

355
00:27:08,437 --> 00:27:11,054
Don't go! Don't go.

356
00:27:11,284 --> 00:27:14,860
I've got good news.
Mustique's all right!

357
00:27:15,122 --> 00:27:17,837
She's in the hospital
but she's got a body...

358
00:27:18,064 --> 00:27:20,844
and she's gonna get a real brain too!

359
00:27:21,038 --> 00:27:23,884
I'd like a new brain sometimes.

360
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:27,336
Because I think a new one is shiny!

361
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:30,376
Yeah. She was happy.

362
00:27:30,601 --> 00:27:33,120
I guess she isn't a doll any more.

363
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,104
She must be pretty.

364
00:27:36,774 --> 00:27:38,748
She's beautiful.

365
00:27:39,844 --> 00:27:42,941
She's fabulous, dear.

366
00:27:45,697 --> 00:27:49,917
And we're gonna make you fabulous
too, darling.

367
00:27:56,923 --> 00:27:58,100
That one.

368
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:02,129
Scarlet Surrender is best.

369
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:05,206
Now, sit still...

370
00:28:06,038 --> 00:28:10,029
- or you'll make me do it wrong.
- I won't move a muscle.

371
00:28:10,227 --> 00:28:13,837
As I don't have muscles anyway,
so I won't move them.

372
00:28:15,793 --> 00:28:17,199
Puff your lips.

373
00:28:18,575 --> 00:28:19,884
Get ready.

374
00:28:39,556 --> 00:28:40,668
There.

375
00:28:45,569 --> 00:28:47,390
I think you're nice.

376
00:28:54,619 --> 00:28:55,960
It's silly.

377
00:28:57,658 --> 00:28:59,599
You got red on me.

378
00:28:59,993 --> 00:29:01,715
Silly kisser.

379
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:08,050
The old lady who lived here
was a silly kisser too.

380
00:29:08,852 --> 00:29:10,345
She kissed me.

381
00:29:11,123 --> 00:29:13,064
That was when I was little.

382
00:29:13,266 --> 00:29:15,087
She was my grandma.

383
00:29:16,464 --> 00:29:18,318
She never kissed me...

384
00:29:20,014 --> 00:29:22,184
because I didn't get born yet.

385
00:29:22,444 --> 00:29:26,054
Sometimes she did this in my mouth...

386
00:29:28,394 --> 00:29:30,368
and that was fun.

387
00:29:30,952 --> 00:29:33,733
It was a snake, I think...

388
00:29:34,054 --> 00:29:36,835
or a goldfish dancing.

389
00:29:37,381 --> 00:29:41,056
Some days I'd be here all day
kissing with her.

390
00:29:41,282 --> 00:29:45,306
She's a nice lady. Except she's dead.

391
00:29:46,271 --> 00:29:47,678
Dickens...

392
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:53,145
she was your girlfriend.

393
00:29:53,851 --> 00:29:56,305
You were her boyfriend.

394
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:03,765
No...

395
00:30:03,991 --> 00:30:07,785
I was her cutie... I was her little cutie.

396
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,473
But she...

397
00:30:11,954 --> 00:30:14,767
she did fall down the steps and die.

398
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,176
I ran down when she did that.

399
00:30:19,534 --> 00:30:23,623
Because I was just little,
I didn't know what to do.

400
00:30:24,492 --> 00:30:26,792
I was scared.

401
00:30:29,033 --> 00:30:32,860
- She's nice lady. - Dickens...

402
00:30:38,308 --> 00:30:40,216
you're a little cutie.

403
00:30:46,943 --> 00:30:49,178
You're a little cutie too.

404
00:30:54,779 --> 00:30:56,404
Silly kissers!

405
00:30:56,921 --> 00:30:58,546
Silly kissers!

406
00:30:59,736 --> 00:31:00,597
Silly...

407
00:31:03,638 --> 00:31:04,586
A bomb!

408
00:31:06,228 --> 00:31:08,496
They're exploding the ground!

409
00:31:09,394 --> 00:31:12,557
It's bigger than firecrackers
and bullets.

410
00:31:12,753 --> 00:31:17,485
- I love firecrackers.
- Me too. I really do.

411
00:31:40,578 --> 00:31:42,781
It's the boom hole!

412
00:31:42,976 --> 00:31:44,797
It's the edge of the world.

413
00:31:44,992 --> 00:31:47,063
It's the Hundred Year Ocean.

414
00:31:56,026 --> 00:31:57,748
I got a secret.

415
00:31:59,128 --> 00:32:02,029
If I say, you can't tell, okay?

416
00:32:02,998 --> 00:32:07,981
Because if Dell knows she'll wallop me
good and I'll be in trouble forever.

417
00:32:08,211 --> 00:32:09,323
What is it?

418
00:32:11,921 --> 00:32:14,375
It's a giant atom bomb.

419
00:32:15,055 --> 00:32:17,421
And the end of the whole world.

420
00:32:17,614 --> 00:32:21,606
Yeah, like a big tidal wave
that goes whoosh!

421
00:32:22,027 --> 00:32:25,375
And everything gets cleaned away
like chemicals...

422
00:32:25,609 --> 00:32:29,121
and the Baby Jesus returns
forever and ever.

423
00:32:29,383 --> 00:32:30,811
Amen.

424
00:32:31,655 --> 00:32:32,799
I wanna see.

425
00:32:33,926 --> 00:32:38,811
I don't know. Maybe tomorrow
when Dell drives to town.

426
00:32:40,226 --> 00:32:41,883
If you show me...

427
00:32:43,648 --> 00:32:45,469
you can keep the arm.

428
00:32:46,366 --> 00:32:50,706
Is it a boy or a girl?
Because a girl is nice, I think.

429
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:53,939
- It's a boy.
- How can you tell?

430
00:33:01,654 --> 00:33:06,702
- No, that doesn't mean it's a boy.
- Yes, it does.

431
00:33:07,795 --> 00:33:09,169
It's a thingy.

432
00:33:09,522 --> 00:33:11,976
You got a thingy. I know.

433
00:33:12,208 --> 00:33:14,956
No, that's wrong. I don't have that.

434
00:33:16,014 --> 00:33:17,672
I don't have that.

435
00:33:18,509 --> 00:33:19,785
Dickens.

436
00:33:22,443 --> 00:33:23,969
Dickens...

437
00:33:25,833 --> 00:33:28,166
I'd like to see your secret.

438
00:33:29,064 --> 00:33:30,405
I don't know.

439
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:36,993
You're my boyfriend.

440
00:33:38,114 --> 00:33:39,575
My cutie.

441
00:33:41,793 --> 00:33:44,377
You're my dear sweet Captain...

442
00:33:45,854 --> 00:33:47,828
and I'm Mrs Captain.

443
00:33:48,988 --> 00:33:51,092
I don't understand that.

444
00:33:53,178 --> 00:33:55,381
I better go home, I think.

445
00:34:23,146 --> 00:34:28,065
Dickens has a girlfriend.
He's your boyfriend.

446
00:34:28,327 --> 00:34:30,236
He's my husband.

447
00:34:30,502 --> 00:34:34,112
And I... I... I...

448
00:34:34,436 --> 00:34:35,645
I'm his wife.

449
00:34:35,876 --> 00:34:39,452
He's dreamboat. He's a sunny cloud.

450
00:34:39,809 --> 00:34:40,889
Kiss me.

451
00:34:41,504 --> 00:34:44,950
- You're a girl.
- Kiss me and I'll be a boy.

452
00:34:45,566 --> 00:34:50,550
- Girls don't kiss girls that way.
- Please.

453
00:34:56,568 --> 00:34:58,454
Oh baby.

454
00:35:04,308 --> 00:35:06,195
You're disgusting.

455
00:35:06,419 --> 00:35:09,679
That was fun. That was great.

456
00:35:09,872 --> 00:35:13,383
- You're my best friend.
- And you're mine too.

457
00:35:13,614 --> 00:35:15,718
And I love Dickens!

458
00:35:16,141 --> 00:35:20,776
He's the sweet prince.
He's the great king.

459
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:23,998
He's apply juice and jerky!

460
00:35:24,297 --> 00:35:26,151
We're a happy family.

461
00:35:26,344 --> 00:35:29,887
And Dell will marry daddy
and look after us all.

462
00:35:30,342 --> 00:35:35,260
And we'll explore the Hundred
Years Ocean. It's a dream come true.

463
00:35:35,491 --> 00:35:37,497
It's Christmas!

464
00:35:52,378 --> 00:35:54,482
And what do we have here?

465
00:35:56,248 --> 00:35:59,148
I think a baby is in me from kissing.

466
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:04,176
I think it's Mustique.
I think she's come back.

467
00:36:04,755 --> 00:36:07,405
Tell Dickens.
Tell him about the baby.

468
00:36:07,601 --> 00:36:11,822
Then he'll let you see his special secret.
Maybe he's alone.

469
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:15,589
But maybe Dell's still there.

470
00:36:18,624 --> 00:36:19,768
Let's go.

471
00:36:19,999 --> 00:36:23,511
Let's go see Dickens special secret
in his room.

472
00:36:29,242 --> 00:36:32,307
My sweet honey rose

473
00:36:32,536 --> 00:36:36,244
Strange dark flower rose

474
00:36:36,342 --> 00:36:37,519
Jeliza-Rose

475
00:36:54,221 --> 00:36:56,772
Hello? It's us.

476
00:36:58,410 --> 00:37:00,264
It's Jeliza-Rose.

477
00:37:04,199 --> 00:37:06,564
It's a real nice day for a tea party.

478
00:37:07,014 --> 00:37:11,648
Me and Glitter Gal are here...
in case you're not too busy.

479
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,889
Jeliza-Rose. See what happens when
you're small and hungry all the time?

480
00:37:51,118 --> 00:37:54,345
You're nasty. You deserve it.

481
00:37:54,572 --> 00:37:56,960
Maybe I am nasty,
but at least I'm alive.

482
00:37:57,195 --> 00:37:59,844
Get out while you can,
or she'll close a trap on you too!

483
00:38:00,329 --> 00:38:04,385
Shut up. Shut up!

484
00:38:05,894 --> 00:38:09,951
It's not fair! I didn't know
you were there. You scared me good!

485
00:38:10,147 --> 00:38:12,513
No, no, it was an accident.

486
00:38:12,834 --> 00:38:15,734
You just got spooked, that's all.

487
00:38:15,937 --> 00:38:19,131
- It was all them ugly dead things and all.
- No, that's not right.

488
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:20,796
No, that's not right.

489
00:38:21,022 --> 00:38:24,631
Because Dell makes them alive again
and that's what she does!

490
00:38:24,828 --> 00:38:28,241
And she's Jesus how she makes
them alive again!

491
00:38:29,497 --> 00:38:31,830
You scared me good,
I didn't know you was there!

492
00:38:32,088 --> 00:38:33,494
I think I fainted.

493
00:38:34,038 --> 00:38:35,314
I'm sorry.

494
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:38,323
Don't do that again or I'll die, okay?

495
00:38:38,804 --> 00:38:39,883
Okay.

496
00:38:40,947 --> 00:38:43,215
All right. I'm sorry.

497
00:38:44,241 --> 00:38:47,239
I think I'm sorry too. Think so.

498
00:38:51,949 --> 00:38:53,290
Dickens...

499
00:38:55,275 --> 00:38:58,056
Glitter Gal wants to tell you something.

500
00:39:06,533 --> 00:39:09,281
That baby sounds like a strange thing.

501
00:39:09,476 --> 00:39:13,696
We can build a castle...
and Dell will marry my daddy.

502
00:39:14,592 --> 00:39:15,802
But...

503
00:39:16,288 --> 00:39:20,148
you have to show me
your special secret first.

504
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:26,073
No, I can't build a castle.
I don't know how.

505
00:39:26,298 --> 00:39:29,046
I don't know how. No.

506
00:39:31,064 --> 00:39:34,956
Dickens... if you show me your secret...

507
00:39:35,893 --> 00:39:37,834
I'll love you forever.

508
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:50,122
I'll show you, okay? Just once only.

509
00:39:51,244 --> 00:39:55,519
But if I don't unpack this bag before
Dell gets back, I won't eat tonight.

510
00:39:55,754 --> 00:39:58,502
So you wait, okay? You wait.

511
00:39:58,761 --> 00:40:01,542
Don't touch nothing.
This is Dell's place.

512
00:40:01,735 --> 00:40:02,782
All right.

513
00:40:03,718 --> 00:40:05,756
I'll wait for my cutie.

514
00:40:06,756 --> 00:40:08,348
You're my kisser.

515
00:40:13,409 --> 00:40:16,441
What do you wanna see his special
secret for? You're better off not knowing.

516
00:40:16,607 --> 00:40:18,777
Look what happens. I was curious.

517
00:40:19,966 --> 00:40:21,525
You know what Dell's gonna do to me?

518
00:40:21,693 --> 00:40:22,969
We have to help him.

519
00:40:24,315 --> 00:40:28,307
You do it. I don't wanna get in trouble.

520
00:40:30,424 --> 00:40:32,790
That's it, that's it. I'm free, I'm free!

521
00:40:51,692 --> 00:40:54,985
We can't wake mama,
so we can't talk like this...

522
00:40:55,242 --> 00:40:57,412
unless we talk like this first.

523
00:40:59,944 --> 00:41:01,601
Because we're ghosts.

524
00:41:03,366 --> 00:41:06,779
- We're quiet ghosts.
- Nice.

525
00:41:09,122 --> 00:41:11,804
Your house is the witch's cave.

526
00:41:12,609 --> 00:41:16,349
We're disappearing
and we won't get caught.

527
00:41:16,575 --> 00:41:18,941
Yeah, that's a good idea, I think.

528
00:41:19,197 --> 00:41:21,847
Because Dell will wallop me
for having company.

529
00:41:40,306 --> 00:41:42,312
It's Halloween.

530
00:41:57,096 --> 00:42:00,161
My room! My room, my room.

531
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:06,752
You better get on the bed so you don't
crush nothing important, okay?

532
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:07,873
Okay.

533
00:42:27,385 --> 00:42:29,271
- Is there candy in it?
- No.

534
00:42:30,903 --> 00:42:33,170
It's my special secret.

535
00:42:33,813 --> 00:42:37,585
It's the eight wonder.
The great wave.

536
00:42:39,378 --> 00:42:41,199
The end of the world!

537
00:42:41,425 --> 00:42:42,635
Dynamite.

538
00:42:43,919 --> 00:42:47,234
- How do you explode them?
- Like a firecracker, I think.

539
00:42:47,437 --> 00:42:51,657
Like a war bomb! Boom! Kaboom!

540
00:42:51,883 --> 00:42:54,270
And everything gets cleaned away.

541
00:42:54,698 --> 00:42:58,340
The end of the world. Blown to bits.

542
00:42:59,079 --> 00:43:00,802
So I'll keep them.

543
00:43:01,926 --> 00:43:04,575
Yeah, I'll keep them until I'm an old man...

544
00:43:05,284 --> 00:43:09,689
and then I'll kill that shark...
and I'll be a hero...

545
00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:11,198
I'm pretty sure.

546
00:43:11,553 --> 00:43:15,773
And I'll help you.
That way we can be on TV.

547
00:43:18,685 --> 00:43:20,211
Because you love me.

548
00:43:24,954 --> 00:43:27,254
I'm your wife forever.

549
00:43:40,145 --> 00:43:43,111
That's baby's asleep, I think.

550
00:43:44,302 --> 00:43:45,927
It's snoring.

551
00:43:47,884 --> 00:43:49,225
She's growing.

552
00:43:50,379 --> 00:43:52,004
She's coming tonight...

553
00:43:52,714 --> 00:43:53,608
or tomorrow.

554
00:43:55,177 --> 00:43:57,031
I bet she's pretty.

555
00:43:57,991 --> 00:44:01,372
I bet she's pretty,
I bet she's pretty like you.

556
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:06,585
Where's that place?

557
00:44:08,066 --> 00:44:10,683
The whole bottom of the ocean.

558
00:44:11,904 --> 00:44:16,277
There are whole cities there,
with people and dogs.

559
00:44:16,541 --> 00:44:21,721
There are castles there...
and farms and husbands and wives...

560
00:44:21,946 --> 00:44:25,970
and babies, and ghosts...

561
00:44:27,031 --> 00:44:29,169
and silly kissers too.

562
00:44:29,687 --> 00:44:32,020
And kissers that do this...

563
00:45:01,541 --> 00:45:04,289
- It's mama, I think.
- Is she awake?

564
00:45:04,707 --> 00:45:06,299
I don't know.

565
00:45:07,458 --> 00:45:10,271
Because that never happens,
but maybe it happens.

566
00:45:11,136 --> 00:45:14,363
If mama quit dozing
I'll go see if she wants soup.

567
00:45:16,381 --> 00:45:17,722
Dickens, I'm scared.

568
00:45:19,324 --> 00:45:20,697
Me too.

569
00:45:20,954 --> 00:45:24,433
If we go together, we're safe.

570
00:45:25,944 --> 00:45:27,253
Yeah, all right.

571
00:45:46,381 --> 00:45:47,525
Mama?

572
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:56,228
It's damn bad.

573
00:46:02,756 --> 00:46:05,754
Dell says someday mama will wake.

574
00:46:05,986 --> 00:46:10,523
And she says someday there'll be a
pill or a story or something...

575
00:46:10,688 --> 00:46:13,501
and that'll make her eyes
come alive again.

576
00:46:13,726 --> 00:46:17,618
Because if she gets buried
she'll be gone for good.

577
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:20,273
That's my gift.

578
00:46:23,289 --> 00:46:25,491
And that's daddy's map!

579
00:46:26,487 --> 00:46:28,853
No, no, they're Dell's.

580
00:46:29,813 --> 00:46:31,307
It's all hers.

581
00:46:32,628 --> 00:46:34,798
Her place is with mama.

582
00:46:46,156 --> 00:46:47,682
It's daddy.

583
00:46:50,538 --> 00:46:53,951
And that's Dell.
She was beautiful once.

584
00:46:54,152 --> 00:46:56,006
Not a pirate or a ghost.

585
00:46:56,902 --> 00:47:00,381
She had two good eyes
and she loved your daddy.

586
00:47:01,924 --> 00:47:03,832
They were kissers.

587
00:47:04,130 --> 00:47:05,885
Young kissers.

588
00:47:06,465 --> 00:47:09,497
Dell and my daddy were young kissers.

589
00:47:09,664 --> 00:47:10,525
No.

590
00:47:10,719 --> 00:47:12,922
They do it like we do it.

591
00:47:13,885 --> 00:47:17,364
No, no...

592
00:47:18,171 --> 00:47:20,057
They do it like we do it.

593
00:47:22,681 --> 00:47:24,054
I'm Dell...

594
00:47:24,408 --> 00:47:28,018
and you're my daddy...
and we're married...

595
00:47:28,533 --> 00:47:30,801
and our baby's coming.

596
00:47:37,456 --> 00:47:39,528
Filth! Evil!

597
00:47:39,727 --> 00:47:41,319
Rotten! Rotten!

598
00:47:41,519 --> 00:47:42,979
No, Dell!

599
00:47:43,213 --> 00:47:47,880
Doing that in here!
Dickens, bringing that nasty...

600
00:47:48,106 --> 00:47:50,723
- nastiness into our home!
- No, Dell, no.

601
00:47:50,953 --> 00:47:53,286
This is my room, mama's...

602
00:47:53,896 --> 00:47:57,723
I'm sorry, Dell, I'm sorry.

603
00:47:57,957 --> 00:47:59,582
Like father like daughter!

604
00:48:01,252 --> 00:48:06,209
Spy! Watching in the bushes,
you vile nasty child!

605
00:48:06,209 --> 00:48:07,866
- I didn't do anything! - Liar!

606
00:48:08,128 --> 00:48:09,055
Dell...

607
00:48:09,312 --> 00:48:12,310
Spy... with your little spies!

608
00:48:12,542 --> 00:48:13,435
No!

609
00:48:13,885 --> 00:48:16,273
You'll starve now, you hear me?

610
00:48:16,507 --> 00:48:18,928
No more food for you! No more you!

611
00:48:19,163 --> 00:48:24,561
Dell, no, Dell!

612
00:48:29,012 --> 00:48:31,564
Now. Who have we here?

613
00:48:32,754 --> 00:48:34,128
It's Mustique!

614
00:48:34,354 --> 00:48:35,663
A troublesome creature.

615
00:48:35,857 --> 00:48:38,703
- She's mine! I hate you!
- I don't think so. No, no, no.

616
00:48:42,062 --> 00:48:44,995
Now look at what you done.
Look at what you done now!

617
00:48:46,443 --> 00:48:47,653
All right.

618
00:48:47,883 --> 00:48:50,053
All right, my boy.

619
00:48:50,281 --> 00:48:53,094
- Dell's here. Dell's got...
- Leave him alone!

620
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:55,358
- Leave him! Witch!
- Get off me!

621
00:48:55,559 --> 00:48:56,965
Leave him!

622
00:49:02,594 --> 00:49:03,935
Mama.

623
00:49:06,432 --> 00:49:08,700
I've got your hat, you witch!

624
00:49:08,927 --> 00:49:11,097
Now you'll get stung by bees and die.

625
00:49:11,326 --> 00:49:14,074
You'll die.
And get out in the earth and die!

626
00:49:14,301 --> 00:49:15,315
Mama.

627
00:49:36,209 --> 00:49:37,288
You're gonna die now!

628
00:49:46,571 --> 00:49:48,937
I didn't do anything! I didn't!

629
00:49:49,321 --> 00:49:51,459
I didn't do anything!

630
00:49:53,415 --> 00:49:56,316
She's got them all, daddy. I'm next.

631
00:49:56,518 --> 00:50:00,128
When she finds the squirrel gone
she'll destroy me for sure.

632
00:50:00,963 --> 00:50:04,856
Probably she'll hang my head
in her living room!

633
00:50:12,253 --> 00:50:15,666
You're dreaming yourself
far away, daddy.

634
00:50:16,954 --> 00:50:19,768
Further than the Hundred Years Ocean.

635
00:50:22,104 --> 00:50:23,990
Beyond Jutland...

636
00:50:24,726 --> 00:50:28,979
deep, deep, deep...
in the place where dreams are made.

637
00:50:31,634 --> 00:50:33,488
We'll be a happy family.

638
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:38,886
We'll build a castle of crooked branches...

639
00:50:39,566 --> 00:50:41,452
and flattened pennies.

640
00:50:42,925 --> 00:50:44,200
Eat meat...

641
00:50:44,748 --> 00:50:48,608
and butter tarts... and drink lemonade...

642
00:50:48,842 --> 00:50:51,742
from gold-plated paper cups.

643
00:50:55,174 --> 00:50:57,507
I'll dream myself there too.

644
00:50:58,596 --> 00:51:02,652
If I shut my eyes and try hard enough...

645
00:51:03,586 --> 00:51:06,650
maybe I'll wake inside your dream.

646
00:51:28,564 --> 00:51:30,570
The end of the world.

647
00:53:09,022 --> 00:53:10,134
Dickens!

648
00:53:13,339 --> 00:53:17,876
You killed it!
You killed the monster shark, Dickens!

649
00:53:19,735 --> 00:53:21,327
I love you.

650
00:53:33,456 --> 00:53:34,470
Little girl.

651
00:53:36,335 --> 00:53:37,676
Are you hurt?

652
00:53:38,477 --> 00:53:40,298
Are you okay, little girl?

653
00:53:44,074 --> 00:53:46,080
I'm hungry is all.

654
00:53:49,064 --> 00:53:51,779
Well, here... I have something.

655
00:53:59,330 --> 00:54:02,710
Are you traveling alone
or with someone?

656
00:54:04,256 --> 00:54:05,400
Don't know.

657
00:54:07,326 --> 00:54:09,626
I guess Dickens will come and get me.

658
00:54:10,044 --> 00:54:11,865
I'm pretty sure he will.

659
00:54:15,002 --> 00:54:17,335
So your parents weren't on the train?

660
00:54:22,261 --> 00:54:24,268
You're all alone like me then.

661
00:54:26,132 --> 00:54:27,757
It happened so fast.

662
00:54:28,530 --> 00:54:29,958
So fast.

663
00:54:30,833 --> 00:54:33,996
We're two of the lucky ones...
thank God.

664
00:54:35,950 --> 00:54:38,763
Very, very lucky.

665
00:54:39,821 --> 00:54:44,193
Dickens? Dickens?

666
00:54:45,737 --> 00:54:47,296
Dickens?

667
00:54:48,456 --> 00:54:50,822
- You stay far. - Dickens?

668
00:54:51,206 --> 00:54:52,961
Mess elsewhere.

669
00:54:53,157 --> 00:54:54,879
Dickens?

670
00:54:55,172 --> 00:54:59,480
Where are you, boy? Dickens?

671
00:55:01,313 --> 00:55:03,199
My captain.

672
00:55:03,711 --> 00:55:05,848
It's okay. It's okay.

673
00:55:08,189 --> 00:55:09,749
We're safe now.

674
00:55:13,210 --> 00:55:15,543
We'll take care of each other,
how's that?

675
00:55:16,633 --> 00:55:19,348
And I'll make sure you get
where you're going.

676
00:55:40,491 --> 00:55:43,653
They're beautiful. Aren't they?

677
00:55:48,647 --> 00:55:50,785
They're my friends, you know.

678
00:55:52,005 --> 00:55:53,727
They have names.

679
00:55:54,727 --> 00:56:04,727
