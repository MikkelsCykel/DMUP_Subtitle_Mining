00:08:19,982 --> 00:08:21,056
John!

2
00:08:21,984 --> 00:08:23,160
John Rambo!

3
00:08:28,783 --> 00:08:30,262
I don't believe this!

4
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:40,272
- So where you're coming from?
- Washington.

5
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:43,501
- Good to see you again!
- Yeah, you too.

6
00:08:45,717 --> 00:08:47,468
Do you want to tell me about it?

7
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,741
About what?

8
00:08:50,222 --> 00:08:53,888
About yesterday, I've seen you stick
fighting in a warehouse in Bangkok.

9
00:08:54,352 --> 00:08:56,594
- You saw that?
- Yeah.

10
00:08:57,271 --> 00:09:00,079
And today I find you,
working in a monastery.

11
00:09:01,066 --> 00:09:04,048
They let me live here and
I help out, fixing things.

12
00:09:04,194 --> 00:09:05,631
And the stick fighting?

13
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:08,111
I just do that for their lack of money.

14
00:09:10,701 --> 00:09:13,157
Yeah...I saw you give it to the monks.

15
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:14,861
You see a lot.

16
00:09:18,418 --> 00:09:19,708
Colonel, who are they?

17
00:09:19,918 --> 00:09:21,626
They're part of the reason I'm here.

18
00:09:24,383 --> 00:09:27,487
This is Robert Griggs, he's a
field officer of our local embassy.

19
00:09:27,844 --> 00:09:28,958
John Rambo.

20
00:09:30,054 --> 00:09:31,256
Pleasure.

21
00:09:32,056 --> 00:09:33,557
Well, you're sure not easy to find!

22
00:09:33,766 --> 00:09:35,267
Why are you keepin' track?

23
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:39,430
Well, like the Colonel says,
good men are hard to find!

24
00:09:43,318 --> 00:09:45,915
John, I'd like you to take a
look at some of these photos.

25
00:09:46,781 --> 00:09:48,857
I don't know how much you
know about Afghanistan.

26
00:09:49,325 --> 00:09:51,995
Most people can't even find it on a map!

27
00:09:52,453 --> 00:09:54,659
But over two million civilians,

28
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:57,259
mostly peasants
farmers and their families,

29
00:09:57,261 --> 00:10:01,119
have been systematically
slaughtered by invading Russian armies.

30
00:10:01,504 --> 00:10:03,793
Every new weapon,

31
00:10:06,718 --> 00:10:09,921
including chemical warfare, has
been used to eliminate these people.

32
00:10:10,492 --> 00:10:12,950
And they've been very
successful, at many levels.

33
00:10:14,352 --> 00:10:18,059
I assume that you're out of touch
with the current states of the war.

34
00:10:18,813 --> 00:10:20,521
But after nine years of fighting,

35
00:10:20,982 --> 00:10:23,503
the Afghan Forces are now
getting their Stinger missiles,

36
00:10:23,504 --> 00:10:26,025
and are now beginning to hold
their own against the Air-Strikes.

37
00:10:26,489 --> 00:10:30,071
Except for one region,
50 miles over the border.

38
00:10:31,035 --> 00:10:34,302
Apparently, the Soviet Commander
there is exceptionally brutal,

39
00:10:34,455 --> 00:10:36,115
as those photos indicate.

40
00:10:36,582 --> 00:10:39,767
And he's managed to string
allow all aid from the outside.

41
00:10:41,046 --> 00:10:43,204
So we want to...

42
00:10:44,758 --> 00:10:47,254
investigate the problem firsthand.

43
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:49,357
And what that's got to do with me?

44
00:10:51,555 --> 00:10:53,014
They've asked me to go in.

45
00:10:53,954 --> 00:10:55,099
You're not gonna do it?

46
00:10:55,435 --> 00:10:58,851
Yes. And I want you to
come with me, John.

47
00:10:59,439 --> 00:11:00,874
I put in my time.

48
00:11:01,397 --> 00:11:02,518
What does that mean?

49
00:11:03,902 --> 00:11:05,647
It means my war is over.

50
00:11:16,665 --> 00:11:19,771
I thought you said he
was this great soldier.

51
00:11:20,753 --> 00:11:22,129
Well, Colonel...

52
00:11:22,589 --> 00:11:25,335
that's like we've got a
long walk down those stairs.

53
00:11:41,733 --> 00:11:45,150
Don't be tough on him,
he's just following orders.

54
00:11:46,447 --> 00:11:48,485
This mission's important, John.

55
00:11:49,366 --> 00:11:50,759
Do you really think we
can make a difference?

56
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,466
If I didn't, I wouldn't be going.

57
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:55,575
- It didn't before.
- That was another time.

58
00:11:57,082 --> 00:11:58,708
Come with me, John.

59
00:12:03,715 --> 00:12:07,546
I don't know what you think
about this place, but I like it.

60
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:12,675
I like bein' here, I like workin'
here. I like belong into something.

61
00:12:12,724 --> 00:12:15,393
You DO belong into something. Not this.

62
00:12:16,937 --> 00:12:18,494
When you're gonna come full circle?

63
00:12:18,913 --> 00:12:20,365
What are you talkin' about?

64
00:12:21,358 --> 00:12:24,858
You said that your war is over.
I think the one out there is,

65
00:12:25,321 --> 00:12:27,361
but not the one inside you.

66
00:12:27,824 --> 00:12:31,026
I know the reasons you're here, John.
But it doesn't work that way.

67
00:12:31,463 --> 00:12:35,529
You may try, but you can't get
away from what you really are.

68
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,867
And what is it I am?

69
00:12:36,868 --> 00:12:38,468
A full-blooded combat soldier.

70
00:12:38,626 --> 00:12:40,915
Not any more. I dont want it.

71
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:43,205
That's too bad, 'cause
you're stuck with it.

72
00:12:43,881 --> 00:12:45,340
Let me tell you a story, John.

73
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,845
There was a sculptor and he
found a stone, a special stone.

74
00:12:50,304 --> 00:12:52,303
He dragged it home and he
worked on it for months,

75
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:53,990
until he finally finished.

76
00:12:54,725 --> 00:12:56,811
When he was ready, he
showed it to his friends,

77
00:12:56,812 --> 00:12:58,896
and they said he had
created a great statue.

78
00:12:59,397 --> 00:13:01,311
The sculptor said he
hadn't created anything.

79
00:13:01,312 --> 00:13:03,644
The statue was always there.

80
00:13:04,102 --> 00:13:06,708
He just cleared away to small pieces.

81
00:13:08,115 --> 00:13:10,365
We didn't make you
this fighting machine.

82
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:14,151
We just shifted away the rough edges.

83
00:13:14,621 --> 00:13:16,837
Your own is gonna be
tearing away with yourself,

84
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:19,053
until you come to terms
with what you are!

85
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:21,663
Until you come full circle.

86
00:13:24,506 --> 00:13:26,629
I guess I'm not ready yet.

87
00:13:32,223 --> 00:13:34,050
Well, I got to move.

88
00:13:36,394 --> 00:13:39,893
Promise me you'll look me
when you're next in the States.

89
00:13:40,732 --> 00:13:41,930
I promise.

90
00:13:42,484 --> 00:13:43,860
Colonel!

91
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:48,188
I'm sorry. But it's gotta
end for me sometime.

92
00:13:51,183 --> 00:13:52,226
I understand.

93
00:15:16,269 --> 00:15:17,783
Take cover!

94
00:15:42,901 --> 00:15:46,001
Drop your weapons and
remain where you are!

95
00:15:47,364 --> 00:15:49,156
You cannot escape!

96
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:56,407
Drop your weapons!

97
00:15:56,874 --> 00:15:58,499
You have no chance of escape!

98
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:02,412
Drop your weapons!

99
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:03,917
Now!

100
00:16:29,986 --> 00:16:30,924
Rambo!

101
00:16:33,015 --> 00:16:34,421
Something went wrong.

102
00:16:34,683 --> 00:16:35,660
What happened?

103
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:38,514
Soviets intercepted the
team, just over the border.

104
00:16:40,294 --> 00:16:43,045
Among we've gathered,
Trautman and the rest of his party

105
00:16:43,047 --> 00:16:45,381
have been taken to the
regional commandment post.

106
00:16:45,924 --> 00:16:47,622
And what are you doing about it?

107
00:16:49,179 --> 00:16:50,679
I can't do anything about it.

108
00:16:51,306 --> 00:16:52,453
I'm sorry.

109
00:16:52,932 --> 00:16:55,192
I just thought you should know.

110
00:16:57,061 --> 00:16:58,363
What about me?

111
00:17:00,814 --> 00:17:02,060
About you?

112
00:17:02,061 --> 00:17:03,723
Can you get me in?

113
00:17:04,194 --> 00:17:05,420
You're not serious.

114
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:07,064
Oh yeah, I'm serious.

115
00:17:09,783 --> 00:17:11,075
It can't be done officially.

116
00:17:11,076 --> 00:17:12,679
Make it unofficial.

117
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,415
If it can be done, I want you to
know upfront of your capture,

118
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:19,370
or any of this leaks,

119
00:17:19,835 --> 00:17:23,786
we'll deny any participation, or
even knowledge of your existence.

120
00:17:25,298 --> 00:17:26,709
I'm used to it.

121
00:17:28,302 --> 00:17:29,676
We'll get back.

122
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:58,036
You want to buy? Many guns here!

123
00:18:58,354 --> 00:19:01,101
No. I'm looking for Mousa Chanin.

124
00:19:02,025 --> 00:19:05,192
- What's your name?
- John Rambo.

125
00:19:08,155 --> 00:19:09,353
Wait here.

126
00:19:32,265 --> 00:19:33,462
They sell many in Afghanistan.

127
00:19:36,226 --> 00:19:37,685
Many landmines.

128
00:19:38,145 --> 00:19:39,604
Landmines everywhere.

129
00:19:41,524 --> 00:19:44,023
I am Mousa Chanin.
What is it you want?

130
00:19:44,129 --> 00:19:45,481
I was sent by Griggs.

131
00:19:47,113 --> 00:19:49,610
You do not look like
men Griggs sent before.

132
00:19:49,715 --> 00:19:52,107
You not look like you are with military.

133
00:19:52,911 --> 00:19:54,179
I'm not.

134
00:19:54,389 --> 00:19:56,074
What you are? A mercenary?

135
00:19:57,833 --> 00:19:59,269
No.

136
00:19:59,374 --> 00:20:01,030
You're not a military, you're
not a mercenary, what are you?

137
00:20:01,552 --> 00:20:02,894
Lost tourist?

138
00:20:09,094 --> 00:20:10,884
I'm not a tourist.

139
00:20:12,514 --> 00:20:13,721
Sorry.

140
00:20:13,826 --> 00:20:15,448
Do you know where the American is?

141
00:20:15,601 --> 00:20:18,181
Yes. In a Soviet fort.

142
00:20:18,562 --> 00:20:22,181
Near the village of Khost,
30 miles over the border.

143
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:25,424
Mr. Griggs sent you the
supplies you asked for.

144
00:20:26,111 --> 00:20:27,153
You wish to see them now?

145
00:20:27,571 --> 00:20:28,508
Yeah.

146
00:20:31,408 --> 00:20:32,717
Is this what you asked for?

147
00:20:33,448 --> 00:20:34,442
Yeah.

148
00:20:34,996 --> 00:20:37,487
Never seen these things
before. What are these?

149
00:20:37,957 --> 00:20:40,495
- Detonators.
- And this?

150
00:20:41,586 --> 00:20:42,867
What is this for?

151
00:20:44,214 --> 00:20:45,650
It's blue light.

152
00:20:45,651 --> 00:20:47,085
What does it do?

153
00:20:47,885 --> 00:20:49,717
It turns blue.

154
00:20:50,865 --> 00:20:51,759
I see.

155
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:54,534
Can you tell me how many
more men come with us?

156
00:20:54,683 --> 00:20:56,675
There's no rescue team. There's just me.

157
00:20:57,433 --> 00:20:59,310
Just you? Come on, this is no good!

158
00:20:59,415 --> 00:21:01,395
I can not take only one man to the fort.

159
00:21:01,397 --> 00:21:03,378
You need more men to help.

160
00:21:03,901 --> 00:21:06,606
Griggs said you'd take
me there. Take me there!

161
00:21:07,238 --> 00:21:09,213
I am meant to take medical supplies,

162
00:21:09,214 --> 00:21:11,500
if I not take it, many people will die.

163
00:21:11,659 --> 00:21:13,035
Do you understand?

164
00:21:14,621 --> 00:21:16,578
Well, I do not know who you really are,

165
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:20,228
but by the way you look, I can see
you have no experience in war. Do you?

166
00:21:21,585 --> 00:21:22,866
Come on, do you?

167
00:21:24,046 --> 00:21:26,060
I've fired a few shots.

168
00:21:29,553 --> 00:21:31,190
A few shots?

169
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:34,887
Come on, maybe you should go back home,

170
00:21:34,888 --> 00:21:36,553
and think it all over again.

171
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:38,119
For a very long time.

172
00:21:42,525 --> 00:21:44,352
I did think it over.

173
00:21:45,569 --> 00:21:47,526
You did?

174
00:21:48,405 --> 00:21:50,730
Well, this is your choice.

175
00:21:51,199 --> 00:21:54,616
But let me tell you, you can
not get this American alone.

176
00:21:55,705 --> 00:21:58,374
If you fail, do not blame me.

177
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:00,584
I will accept no responsibility.

178
00:22:03,171 --> 00:22:04,689
Sounds familiar.

179
00:22:39,375 --> 00:22:43,503
My name is Colonel Zaysen,
Regional Commander of this sector.

180
00:22:47,551 --> 00:22:51,679
You're here as the first
American captured in Afghanistan.

181
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:54,174
Congratulations.

182
00:22:55,767 --> 00:22:58,676
I believe you're planning to
supply enemy rebels forces

183
00:22:58,729 --> 00:23:02,666
with Stinger missiles, intending
to destroy Soviet aircraft.

184
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:04,651
If I'm gonna be interrogated,

185
00:23:04,756 --> 00:23:07,403
I wanna be interrogated
by your superiors.

186
00:23:09,406 --> 00:23:12,324
Out here, I have no superiors.

187
00:23:14,162 --> 00:23:15,651
I am in full command.

188
00:23:17,832 --> 00:23:19,723
You're alone here.

189
00:23:24,089 --> 00:23:26,248
Abandoned by your government.

190
00:23:27,801 --> 00:23:31,549
- What do you want?
- Cooperation.

191
00:23:34,369 --> 00:23:38,705
This sector has been under
total control for over five years.

192
00:23:40,481 --> 00:23:43,185
There's little more I can do here.

193
00:23:43,901 --> 00:23:48,081
It is, as you say, without challenges.

194
00:23:51,409 --> 00:23:53,640
If you supply to me
worth information about most

195
00:23:53,641 --> 00:23:56,078
stinger missiles
you're planning to deliver,

196
00:23:56,331 --> 00:23:59,103
it could provide a way
out of this further post.

197
00:24:00,334 --> 00:24:04,037
After all, the end what
everyone really wants...

198
00:24:06,091 --> 00:24:07,253
...is peace.

199
00:24:07,884 --> 00:24:09,711
The Kremlin's got a hell
of a sense of humor.

200
00:24:11,346 --> 00:24:12,508
Please explain.

201
00:24:13,014 --> 00:24:15,577
You talk peace and
disarmament to the world,

202
00:24:15,578 --> 00:24:18,140
and here you are, wiping
out a race of people.

203
00:24:18,604 --> 00:24:21,605
We are wiping out no one.

204
00:24:22,233 --> 00:24:26,644
I think you're too intelligent
to believe such a propaganda!

205
00:24:27,821 --> 00:24:29,981
Now again: where are the missiles?

206
00:24:30,032 --> 00:24:31,550
I don't know anything
about any missiles!

207
00:24:31,551 --> 00:24:33,069
Of course you do!

208
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:36,809
But you do not seem to realize
I'm providing a way out for us both.

209
00:24:36,956 --> 00:24:38,787
You expect sympathy?

210
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,875
You started this damn war,
now you have to deal with it!

211
00:24:42,128 --> 00:24:46,527
And we will. It is just a matter of time
before we achieve a complete victory.

212
00:24:46,675 --> 00:24:47,955
You know there won't be a victory.

213
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:51,799
Everyday, your war machines lose
ground to a bunch of poorly armed,

214
00:24:52,263 --> 00:24:53,882
poorly equiped freedom-fighters!

215
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:56,846
The fact is that you
underestimated your competition.

216
00:24:57,325 --> 00:24:58,733
If you studied your History,

217
00:24:58,734 --> 00:25:00,453
you'd know this people
never gave up to anyone.

218
00:25:00,606 --> 00:25:04,563
They'd rather die than be
slaves to an invading army.

219
00:25:04,818 --> 00:25:06,567
You can't defeat a people like that.

220
00:25:07,237 --> 00:25:10,260
We tried. We already had our Vietnam!

221
00:25:11,492 --> 00:25:13,363
Now you're gonna have yours!

222
00:25:13,411 --> 00:25:17,199
So, you wish to test me. Good.

223
00:25:56,622 --> 00:25:58,035
This is Afghanistan.

224
00:25:59,542 --> 00:26:01,790
Alexander the Great tried
to conquer this country,

225
00:26:02,086 --> 00:26:06,141
then Ghenghis Khan, then
the British, now Russia.

226
00:26:07,238 --> 00:26:09,968
But Afghan people fight
hard, they never be defeated.

227
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:14,741
Ancient enemy make prayer about
these people. Do you wish to hear?

228
00:26:16,017 --> 00:26:18,769
Very good. It says:

229
00:26:19,229 --> 00:26:21,471
"May God deliver us from
the venom of the cobra,

230
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:25,274
teeth of the tiger, and the
vengeance of the Afghans."

231
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:28,690
Understand what this means?

232
00:26:30,491 --> 00:26:33,492
That you guys don't take any shit.

233
00:26:34,245 --> 00:26:36,700
Yes, something like this.

234
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:42,660
We go now!

235
00:27:17,706 --> 00:27:20,577
In the north, there are many
caves, we'll travel through them.

236
00:27:21,377 --> 00:27:23,417
It'll be safer. We go!

237
00:27:28,009 --> 00:27:30,380
This cave leads to the
"Valley of the Five Lions".

238
00:27:31,011 --> 00:27:35,721
The Afghan King was asked to send
500 of his warriors into battle.

239
00:27:36,184 --> 00:27:37,809
He sent only five.

240
00:27:40,689 --> 00:27:43,476
His greatest five, and they won.

241
00:27:43,942 --> 00:27:47,026
He said, it's better to send
five lions than 500 sheep.

242
00:27:47,487 --> 00:27:50,657
- What do you think of this?
- I think the King was lucky.

243
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:56,527
- How much longer till the village?
- About two hours.

244
00:28:07,717 --> 00:28:10,967
Where in my sector are the
missiles being delivered?

245
00:28:15,017 --> 00:28:16,262
I don't know.

246
00:28:17,185 --> 00:28:18,680
You liar.

247
00:28:21,856 --> 00:28:22,852
Where?

248
00:28:26,569 --> 00:28:27,815
Where?

249
00:28:28,572 --> 00:28:30,196
OK, I'll tell ya.

250
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:34,828
I knew you were lying.

251
00:28:35,287 --> 00:28:39,011
Now, where are the missiles located?

252
00:28:40,877 --> 00:28:42,157
Close.

253
00:28:42,879 --> 00:28:43,993
How close?

254
00:28:46,299 --> 00:28:47,496
In your ass!

255
00:29:00,438 --> 00:29:03,522
You've tried my patience long enough.

256
00:29:11,262 --> 00:29:13,635
I tried to be civilian.

257
00:29:45,797 --> 00:29:47,376
The name John Rambo...

258
00:29:52,388 --> 00:29:54,305
...do you know it?

259
00:29:56,058 --> 00:29:57,054
No?

260
00:29:58,352 --> 00:30:00,748
He says that there's a
plan for a rescue attempt

261
00:30:00,749 --> 00:30:03,146
with the help of some of the rebels.

262
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:06,605
He also says he knows
where this man is going.

263
00:30:11,615 --> 00:30:12,860
We will welcome him.

264
00:30:31,804 --> 00:30:35,387
It's the last village in the
valley. About 200 man here.

265
00:30:37,684 --> 00:30:39,373
There's a lot of lot of kids in.

266
00:30:39,583 --> 00:30:41,897
Yes, and they are good fighters, too.

267
00:30:42,357 --> 00:30:44,455
I'll tell the leaders you want to talk.

268
00:30:51,282 --> 00:30:53,110
They've never seen men look like you.

269
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:01,938
Here are Mujahedin horsemen.

270
00:31:01,939 --> 00:31:05,211
There are 10.000 horsemen
more waiting at the border.

271
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:07,213
They are waiting to get
weapons, when they'll get it,

272
00:31:07,214 --> 00:31:09,150
they'll come back here to fight.

273
00:31:28,404 --> 00:31:29,982
Let's go to the hospital.

274
00:31:35,537 --> 00:31:37,579
He is the only doctor for 500 km.

275
00:31:41,543 --> 00:31:43,785
The first medicine they
get in two months.

276
00:31:53,096 --> 00:31:56,880
More gifts from the Soviets. They
look like toys, but they're mines.

277
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:59,603
We teach the childrens not to
touch, some of them too late.

278
00:32:04,192 --> 00:32:05,734
Who's that?

279
00:32:06,194 --> 00:32:08,270
His name is Juri. He's Russian.

280
00:32:08,738 --> 00:32:09,945
A deserter?

281
00:32:09,946 --> 00:32:12,404
He calls himself a defector.
There are many like him.

282
00:32:12,868 --> 00:32:16,932
He is the one who can help the most,
he knows the inside of the fort.

283
00:32:20,917 --> 00:32:22,539
I think we should go now.

284
00:32:42,315 --> 00:32:48,234
Mines start here: one meter like
this, then two meters like this,

285
00:32:48,695 --> 00:32:49,894
and like this.

286
00:32:50,364 --> 00:32:52,986
There are four towers, four guards,

287
00:32:53,451 --> 00:32:56,571
here, here, here and here.

288
00:32:57,163 --> 00:32:58,351
Where do they keep the prisoners?

289
00:32:58,769 --> 00:32:59,956
Here.

290
00:33:00,834 --> 00:33:04,037
If we get in there,
is there another way out?

291
00:33:04,838 --> 00:33:07,300
Underground, where
there's all dirty water.

292
00:33:07,967 --> 00:33:10,173
But I do not know word for this place.

293
00:33:10,636 --> 00:33:12,960
He means sewer. Where is it?

294
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:17,723
Here. Outside, you go there.
Guards patrolls there.

295
00:33:18,561 --> 00:33:20,388
I do not think you go this way.

296
00:33:21,105 --> 00:33:23,228
I wish we go to the minefields.
They'll never expect it.

297
00:33:23,691 --> 00:33:27,874
This can not be done.
There are many Spetnaz commandos.

298
00:33:28,654 --> 00:33:31,384
We have all of this,
we've lost many men.

299
00:33:32,367 --> 00:33:33,472
We'll lose more men if we go there.

300
00:33:34,515 --> 00:33:36,244
I don't need many men.

301
00:33:37,706 --> 00:33:38,955
What is it you want to do?

302
00:33:40,333 --> 00:33:41,541
I need two men to lead
me to the minefield,

303
00:33:41,542 --> 00:33:43,168
and two to help to escape.

304
00:33:43,628 --> 00:33:46,795
If this is done, Soviets
will come here like before,

305
00:33:47,257 --> 00:33:48,319
and more people will die.

306
00:33:49,362 --> 00:33:50,631
I can't wait.

307
00:33:51,303 --> 00:33:53,758
You must wait for help the way we wait.

308
00:33:56,016 --> 00:33:58,636
- Then I'll go alone.
- And you will die!

309
00:34:01,648 --> 00:34:03,308
Then I'll die.

310
00:34:08,695 --> 00:34:09,858
Wait!

311
00:34:11,366 --> 00:34:12,694
Please don't go.

312
00:34:20,833 --> 00:34:22,292
My name is Masoud.

313
00:34:23,795 --> 00:34:24,920
You must not judge us,

314
00:34:24,921 --> 00:34:27,818
before you understand why
we are not directed to help.

315
00:34:30,511 --> 00:34:32,586
Most of the Afghan
people are very strong,

316
00:34:33,054 --> 00:34:36,009
and we are determined not
to be driven from our land.

317
00:34:37,518 --> 00:34:41,664
Our children die of disease,
mines, and poison gas.

318
00:34:42,857 --> 00:34:45,269
And our women are raped and killed.

319
00:34:45,943 --> 00:34:50,272
Last year, in the valley of
Legman, the next valley,

320
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:52,177
6.000 Afghans were killed.

321
00:34:54,202 --> 00:34:56,824
Pregnant women were cut with bayonets,

322
00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:00,619
and their babies thrown into the fire.

323
00:35:01,417 --> 00:35:05,747
This is done, so they will not have to
fight the next generation of Afghans.

324
00:35:06,214 --> 00:35:09,666
Yet nobody sees anything, or
reads anything in the papers.

325
00:35:11,219 --> 00:35:12,715
What you see here,

326
00:35:14,222 --> 00:35:16,262
are the Mujahedin soldiers,

327
00:35:16,766 --> 00:35:18,143
holy warriors.

328
00:35:18,603 --> 00:35:21,438
To us, this war is a holy war.

329
00:35:21,898 --> 00:35:24,394
And there is no true
death for a Mujahedin,

330
00:35:24,395 --> 00:35:26,891
because we have taken our last nights,

331
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:30,232
and because we consider us already dead.

332
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:34,733
To us, death for our
land and God is an honor.

333
00:35:35,203 --> 00:35:36,568
So, my friend,

334
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:42,577
what we must do is to stop this
killing of our women and children.

335
00:35:44,421 --> 00:35:46,454
If getting this man free,

336
00:35:47,146 --> 00:35:53,194
so he can tells to the free world, and
tell what happens here, is necessary

337
00:35:53,241 --> 00:35:55,011
then of course we will help.

338
00:35:57,351 --> 00:36:01,977
Leave us now, so we may
speak among ourselves

339
00:36:02,439 --> 00:36:04,977
and find the best way to free this man.

340
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:13,410
- Thank you.
- We thank you.

341
00:36:37,601 --> 00:36:40,555
Don't worry, they will decide soon.

342
00:36:41,022 --> 00:36:43,375
- We got to leave tonight.
- What is your name?

343
00:36:47,068 --> 00:36:49,395
This boy is very hard inside.

344
00:36:49,864 --> 00:36:51,442
His parents were killed last year.

345
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:55,619
His brother died in the
fort where the American is.

346
00:36:56,078 --> 00:36:59,032
He looks like a boy, but
he fights like a man.

347
00:36:59,498 --> 00:37:01,824
- What's your name?
- Rambo.

348
00:37:02,293 --> 00:37:05,129
- Where are you from?
- Arizona.

349
00:37:05,589 --> 00:37:07,399
Arizona? How much days walk?

350
00:37:08,651 --> 00:37:09,835
About two years.

351
00:37:10,301 --> 00:37:11,547
Two years...

352
00:37:13,054 --> 00:37:15,713
- Are you a soldier?
- No more.

353
00:37:17,225 --> 00:37:20,061
I am a soldier. Are you here to fight?

354
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,681
- No.
- Are you scared?

355
00:37:25,776 --> 00:37:28,148
What is this?

356
00:37:28,612 --> 00:37:29,633
It's a knife.

357
00:37:29,634 --> 00:37:31,280
- Can I see this?
- Sure.

358
00:37:39,206 --> 00:37:40,581
Very good. Can I have it?

359
00:37:41,041 --> 00:37:42,037
No.

360
00:37:44,212 --> 00:37:46,204
- What is this?
- You want everything!

361
00:37:46,673 --> 00:37:49,294
- This is for luck.
- What is luck?

362
00:37:49,759 --> 00:37:51,253
Luck is...

363
00:37:53,471 --> 00:37:55,280
Can I have it? I need luck.

364
00:37:55,281 --> 00:37:57,090
So do I!

365
00:38:00,646 --> 00:38:03,978
What a child! Always like this.

366
00:38:07,026 --> 00:38:09,779
Look there! It's our national sport.

367
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:12,795
An old, insane game,
maybe 3.000 years old!

368
00:38:13,993 --> 00:38:15,321
Look, they never stop playing.

369
00:38:19,373 --> 00:38:21,474
War or not war, they don't mind.

370
00:38:22,461 --> 00:38:25,212
- You like it?
- I'll take football.

371
00:38:25,672 --> 00:38:28,838
What is football? You
play it with the foot?

372
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,462
Not really.

373
00:38:41,396 --> 00:38:42,771
Come on, let's go!

374
00:38:54,619 --> 00:38:57,572
- What are they saying?
- They want you to try.

375
00:38:58,038 --> 00:39:01,906
It's a way to them for you to be with
them. If you want to try, go ahead but

376
00:39:02,376 --> 00:39:04,749
I'm not responsible for it!

377
00:39:08,841 --> 00:39:10,917
- I'll try it.
- Yes?

378
00:39:12,887 --> 00:39:14,029
What are the rules?

379
00:39:14,134 --> 00:39:16,736
Well, you have to take
the sheep once around,

380
00:39:16,892 --> 00:39:19,679
and then thrown it in the circle.

381
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:21,328
Why?

382
00:39:21,433 --> 00:39:22,595
Because there is a circle there.

383
00:39:24,857 --> 00:39:27,146
- That's it?
- That's it! Very simple.

384
00:39:29,384 --> 00:39:30,943
Like football.

385
00:39:30,944 --> 00:39:33,231
God must love crazy people!

386
00:39:34,076 --> 00:39:36,430
- Why?
- He makes so many of them!

387
00:47:15,181 --> 00:47:17,089
Now you see how it is here.

388
00:47:18,475 --> 00:47:21,429
Somewhere in a war,
there's supposed to be honor.

389
00:47:21,895 --> 00:47:24,351
Where is the honor here? Where?

390
00:47:27,401 --> 00:47:30,188
We're taking the survivors to
the border. Are you coming?

391
00:47:31,822 --> 00:47:33,103
I'm going to the fort.

392
00:47:33,574 --> 00:47:35,899
Have you not seen enough death?

393
00:47:36,662 --> 00:47:41,240
Go away while you can.
This is not your war.

394
00:47:44,418 --> 00:47:46,043
It is now.

395
00:47:49,883 --> 00:47:52,718
So be it.

396
00:47:53,178 --> 00:47:54,507
You are a good friend.

397
00:48:05,108 --> 00:48:07,599
I stay. I will show you the way.

398
00:48:08,069 --> 00:48:09,396
I will go too.

399
00:48:10,529 --> 00:48:11,560
No, you go with them.

400
00:48:12,030 --> 00:48:16,527
I will not. They killed all
my family. I want to fight!

401
00:48:17,662 --> 00:48:20,235
Not with me. You go!

402
00:48:21,749 --> 00:48:22,745
Go on.

403
00:48:28,131 --> 00:48:29,543
Why must you do this?

404
00:48:31,594 --> 00:48:33,467
Cause he'd do it for me.

405
00:48:59,289 --> 00:49:01,246
Are you decided to talk?

406
00:49:02,333 --> 00:49:03,328
No?

407
00:49:04,710 --> 00:49:05,659
Very well.

408
00:49:06,921 --> 00:49:10,966
Soon you will be my
guest down the hall...

409
00:50:42,855 --> 00:50:44,136
- Go back!
- No!

410
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:45,638
Go back!

411
00:51:14,553 --> 00:51:15,834
Go on!

412
00:51:17,848 --> 00:51:19,117
Stay here! Stay back.

413
00:51:19,118 --> 00:51:20,803
I know this place. You need me!

414
00:51:21,270 --> 00:51:23,974
I don't need you dead!
Now go back. You understand?

415
00:58:27,254 --> 00:58:28,285
American?

416
00:58:29,881 --> 00:58:31,126
American?

417
00:58:53,573 --> 00:58:55,281
Colonel? Colonel?

418
00:59:01,623 --> 00:59:03,700
John? How the hell did you get in here?

419
00:59:04,168 --> 00:59:07,003
- Can you move?
- I can.

420
00:59:09,047 --> 00:59:10,245
Let's go!

421
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:16,198
John, behind you!

422
00:59:27,024 --> 00:59:28,566
Go!

423
00:59:34,157 --> 00:59:36,363
John, get out of here!
Get the hell outta here!

424
01:01:33,510 --> 01:01:35,301
Over here!

425
01:01:35,762 --> 01:01:36,676
Come on!

426
01:01:43,604 --> 01:01:44,980
Help me!

427
01:02:19,892 --> 01:02:21,434
Take him!

428
01:02:42,998 --> 01:02:43,994
Come on!

429
01:02:48,088 --> 01:02:49,333
Give me the boy!

430
01:03:09,150 --> 01:03:10,645
Come!

431
01:03:22,790 --> 01:03:23,655
Come on!

432
01:03:25,794 --> 01:03:26,957
Take the kid!

433
01:03:30,299 --> 01:03:31,497
Jump down!

434
01:04:45,001 --> 01:04:47,575
Give me the boy!

435
01:05:41,810 --> 01:05:45,854
Who is this terrorist? What
makes you so valuable to him?

436
01:05:46,314 --> 01:05:49,974
This bastard tried to destroy
me tonight. But he failed!

437
01:05:50,234 --> 01:05:54,482
At sunrise, I will track him down, and
have his skin hanging on the wall!

438
01:05:54,948 --> 01:05:58,152
- You don't have to hunt him.
- What?

439
01:05:58,619 --> 01:06:00,196
He'll find you.

440
01:06:03,415 --> 01:06:05,658
Are you insane?

441
01:06:06,127 --> 01:06:09,212
One man against trained commandos?

442
01:06:09,673 --> 01:06:13,337
Who do you think this man is? God?

443
01:06:15,260 --> 01:06:18,512
No. God would have mercy. He won't!

444
01:06:32,738 --> 01:06:34,885
It's all right. There's nobody there.

445
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:35,886
Good.

446
01:06:36,033 --> 01:06:37,093
This will hold a while.

447
01:06:38,658 --> 01:06:40,134
What's the fastest way outta here?

448
01:06:40,808 --> 01:06:43,455
Northwest, there's a
trail between mountains,

449
01:06:43,708 --> 01:06:47,540
about three kilometers from
here. The trail is very difficult.

450
01:06:49,547 --> 01:06:52,417
- You take the boy and go.
- I want to stay.

451
01:06:52,967 --> 01:06:54,355
You can't.

452
01:06:56,220 --> 01:06:59,388
You can not go back there.
We must all go to Pakistan.

453
01:07:00,058 --> 01:07:01,742
No, I gotta go back.

454
01:07:02,265 --> 01:07:04,470
I know he's your friend,
but you can't do this!

455
01:07:04,937 --> 01:07:07,517
You both will die.
For what? Come with us!

456
01:07:07,622 --> 01:07:08,638
Just do what I say.

457
01:07:11,194 --> 01:07:13,732
Give me your gun.

458
01:07:18,994 --> 01:07:21,864
All right, let's go. Come on!

459
01:07:39,015 --> 01:07:41,091
I will see you again?

460
01:07:41,851 --> 01:07:42,847
Sure.

461
01:13:40,140 --> 01:13:41,515
Come on!

462
01:13:52,820 --> 01:13:53,945
Can you fly that thing?

463
01:13:54,572 --> 01:13:55,487
Let's find out.

464
01:14:20,223 --> 01:14:21,883
Let's go!

465
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:50,200
Hold on!

466
01:15:00,473 --> 01:15:01,967
Over there!

467
01:15:07,815 --> 01:15:08,764
There!

468
01:15:28,169 --> 01:15:29,663
Hold on!

469
01:15:30,129 --> 01:15:31,458
Get him up!

470
01:15:31,923 --> 01:15:33,880
Take my hand!

471
01:15:58,409 --> 01:15:59,358
We're going down!

472
01:16:14,968 --> 01:16:15,834
Hold on!

473
01:16:32,444 --> 01:16:34,069
Take what you can!

474
01:16:34,530 --> 01:16:37,021
- Come on, move it, move it!
- Go on!

475
01:16:49,628 --> 01:16:51,788
- We gotta hit the border.
- We stay here.

476
01:16:52,257 --> 01:16:53,716
We know where to go.

477
01:16:54,175 --> 01:16:57,176
- Which direction, John?
- Northeast!

478
01:17:45,270 --> 01:17:46,764
Hold it, John!

479
01:17:50,108 --> 01:17:51,731
I gotta rest a minute.

480
01:17:53,946 --> 01:17:54,943
How's your wound?

481
01:17:55,987 --> 01:17:58,027
You taught us to ignore
the pain, didn't ya?

482
01:17:58,493 --> 01:17:59,718
Has it worked?

483
01:18:01,179 --> 01:18:02,195
Not really!

484
01:18:03,747 --> 01:18:05,366
Don't take it personally!

485
01:18:07,042 --> 01:18:08,038
Thanks.

486
01:18:28,732 --> 01:18:31,401
You go on ahead and see if
you can find some cover.

487
01:19:43,644 --> 01:19:46,051
That was close, John! How are you?

488
01:19:46,939 --> 01:19:48,310
Well done!

489
01:19:59,785 --> 01:20:02,869
We won't make it easy for them.
We'd better split out!

490
01:20:04,164 --> 01:20:06,323
I'm sorry I got you into this, John!

491
01:20:06,792 --> 01:20:08,370
No, you're not!

492
01:21:08,981 --> 01:21:12,350
- Are you listening?
- Who are you?

493
01:21:13,736 --> 01:21:15,943
Your worst nightmare.

494
01:23:10,024 --> 01:23:11,021
It's good timing!

495
01:23:11,543 --> 01:23:12,539
What are friends for?

496
01:23:14,844 --> 01:23:17,346
You go back to the hole. I'll cover
you, and see if there's any more left.

497
01:26:34,904 --> 01:26:36,880
Across the valley is the border.

498
01:26:39,117 --> 01:26:40,441
We did it, John!

499
01:26:42,912 --> 01:26:44,192
Wait!

500
01:26:48,127 --> 01:26:50,166
What the hell is that?

501
01:26:53,548 --> 01:26:55,006
The son of a bitch!

502
01:27:20,951 --> 01:27:23,359
Do not try to retreat!

503
01:27:23,912 --> 01:27:25,289
You can not escape.

504
01:27:25,749 --> 01:27:28,074
We will not attack if you do not run!

505
01:27:28,752 --> 01:27:30,018
We do not want to hurt you.

506
01:27:31,062 --> 01:27:32,121
Somehow I don't believe him!

507
01:27:32,589 --> 01:27:36,587
I order you to come forward,
and you will be given a fair trial.

508
01:27:37,052 --> 01:27:39,607
Drop your weapons,
and remain where you are.

509
01:27:39,764 --> 01:27:41,555
You got any ideas?

510
01:27:42,933 --> 01:27:45,305
Drop your weapons!

511
01:27:45,977 --> 01:27:47,698
Surrounding them, Sir.

512
01:27:49,356 --> 01:27:51,978
Helluva time for humor, John!

513
01:27:52,443 --> 01:27:54,851
Drop your weapons! Now!

514
01:27:56,364 --> 01:27:58,024
You have no chance of escape.

515
01:27:58,491 --> 01:28:02,275
Come forward! I want
to pick you back alive.

516
01:28:02,745 --> 01:28:04,952
This is your last warning!

517
01:28:08,210 --> 01:28:09,455
The choice is yours.

518
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:11,579
What do you say, John?

519
01:28:13,798 --> 01:28:15,841
Fuck 'em!

520
01:28:34,070 --> 01:28:36,560
If we're gonna go, I would
crave to take that bastard with us!

521
01:29:14,695 --> 01:29:15,810
What is that?

522
01:29:25,832 --> 01:29:27,540
It's the rebels!

523
01:29:40,180 --> 01:29:40,962
Come on!

524
01:33:25,998 --> 01:33:26,911
John, get out of there!

525
01:35:02,974 --> 01:35:06,474
You're sure you don't want to stay?
You fight good for a tourist!

526
01:35:09,439 --> 01:35:10,873
Maybe next time.

527
01:35:12,276 --> 01:35:13,899
Do you want this back?

528
01:35:14,944 --> 01:35:17,517
No. You keep it.

529
01:35:18,239 --> 01:35:19,900
Can you not stay?

530
01:35:33,715 --> 01:35:35,043
I gotta go.

531
01:35:59,825 --> 01:36:01,236
Goodbye.

532
01:36:09,417 --> 01:36:10,477
Hard to believe, John!

533
01:36:11,313 --> 01:36:12,269
What's that, Sir?

534
01:36:12,630 --> 01:36:16,877
Well, I hate to admit it, but the
truth is I think we're getting soft!

535
01:36:18,385 --> 01:36:20,005
Maybe just a little, Sir...

536
01:36:20,736 --> 01:36:22,195
Just a little!
