00:02:53,647 --> 00:02:55,285
A few days, you say.

2
00:02:56,087 --> 00:02:58,203
Not what I'd call a light traveler
are you, pet?

3
00:02:58,367 --> 00:03:00,517
Sorry, it's mainly work.

4
00:03:01,167 --> 00:03:04,079
l wouldn't apologize for having work,
flower. Not round here.

5
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:08,686
What's this then?

6
00:03:09,167 --> 00:03:11,317
It's just a flugel, a trumpet.

7
00:03:11,487 --> 00:03:13,239
l thought I might get
some practice in.

8
00:03:13,407 --> 00:03:14,522
In here, you mean?

9
00:03:14,687 --> 00:03:18,282
-Well, wherever.
-I wouldn't mind. Don't get me wrong.

10
00:03:18,447 --> 00:03:22,076
There's nowt I’d like better than
to hear you playing all night long.

11
00:03:22,247 --> 00:03:24,522
-Oh, no. It wouldn't ...
-You heard of Grimley Colliery Band?

12
00:03:25,287 --> 00:03:26,845
Yes, I have.

13
00:03:27,127 --> 00:03:30,278
They've their own practice hall.
I should get myself down there, pet.

14
00:03:30,687 --> 00:03:33,042
They'd welcome someone like you
with open arms, knowing them.

15
00:03:45,967 --> 00:03:47,116
Another?

16
00:03:48,647 --> 00:03:52,162
It's a sad old day, isn't it Vi?
When it's finally come to this.

17
00:03:52,327 --> 00:03:56,240
-What's that then Ida?
-Jim and Ernie packing in the band.

18
00:03:57,247 --> 00:03:59,078
They're doing it, then?
For definite?

19
00:03:59,367 --> 00:04:03,724
Last practice tonight, Ernie said.
Then resigning after.

20
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:08,081
No point in carrying on, is there?
Pit goes, band'll go t'same way.

21
00:04:09,447 --> 00:04:12,405
I feel sorry for old Danny, mind.
He’ll gave bugger all to do.

22
00:04:13,167 --> 00:04:16,364
-We’ll all have bugger all to do, Vi.
-You get used to it.

23
00:04:47,967 --> 00:04:49,764
-All right, love?
-Aye, all right.

24
00:04:56,127 --> 00:04:58,004
Don't forget what you're doing,
you lads.

25
00:04:58,167 --> 00:04:59,646
Don't be handing over any
kitty money.

26
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:02,517
-Just resignations.
-Aye, all right, pet.

27
00:05:02,687 --> 00:05:04,678
-Well, mind you do.
-What do you mean "mind you do"?

28
00:05:04,847 --> 00:05:07,486
-It was our decision, wasn't it love?
-Aye, well...

29
00:05:08,367 --> 00:05:09,846
just mind you do.

30
00:05:13,767 --> 00:05:15,485
Now let's get this right, Ernie.

31
00:05:15,847 --> 00:05:19,044
When he collects for t'kitty,
we say: sorry Danny, but us two...

32
00:05:19,207 --> 00:05:21,004
we've decided,
in t'present cIimate...

33
00:05:21,167 --> 00:05:24,796
to tighten our belts, like, and only
spend money on essential items.

34
00:05:24,967 --> 00:05:27,003
Sorry. It’s been
good and all that...

35
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:31,285
but now, we don't regard band as one
of t'aforementioned essential items.

36
00:05:31,447 --> 00:05:34,598
And regretfully, we feel obliged
to tender our resignations forthwith.

37
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:36,280
-Right?
-Right.

38
00:05:37,607 --> 00:05:39,563
And then we wake
up in Casualty.

39
00:05:49,847 --> 00:05:51,644
If he goes barmy, it's not
our fault.

40
00:05:52,607 --> 00:05:55,326
-l mean what's t'worst he can do?
-Have a heart attack?

41
00:05:55,487 --> 00:05:58,479
What the hell, if Danny
doesn't like it...

42
00:05:58,647 --> 00:06:00,126
- bollocks to him.
- All right, lads?

43
00:06:00,287 --> 00:06:02,084
Oh, all right, Danny mate?

44
00:06:04,007 --> 00:06:07,397
Sixty years between us, you and me,
down t'pit, frightened of nowt.

45
00:06:08,527 --> 00:06:10,961
When it comes to telling Danny-boy
we're packing t'band in...

46
00:06:11,607 --> 00:06:13,404
We're shitting bloody bricks.

47
00:06:17,727 --> 00:06:19,319
and coming up later in the news...

48
00:06:19,487 --> 00:06:23,480
continuing our regular reports on the
Government's pit closure programme.

49
00:06:23,647 --> 00:06:25,080
We visit Grimley Colliery...

50
00:06:25,247 --> 00:06:29,286
which despite being one of the oldest
and largest mines in Yorkshire...

51
00:06:29,447 --> 00:06:33,156
has nevertheless become the most
recent candidate for closure.

52
00:06:33,967 --> 00:06:37,516
Although the GrimIey miners, and
their wives, seem very determined...

53
00:06:37,687 --> 00:06:39,917
to fight on and keep
their pit open...

54
00:06:40,087 --> 00:06:43,443
a redundancy offer to the workforce
is believed to be imminent.

55
00:06:44,567 --> 00:06:47,843
The miners, united,
will never be defeated.

56
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:51,761
The miners, united,
will never be defeated.

57
00:06:51,927 --> 00:06:57,399
Offers at neighbouring pits recently,
have been too attractive to ignore.

58
00:06:57,647 --> 00:07:02,323
<i>In the last few weeks, 7 pay-off
packages have been offered to 7 pits.</i>

59
00:07:02,487 --> 00:07:05,285
<i>All accepted,
leading to 7 cIosures.</i>

60
00:07:05,447 --> 00:07:07,677
Trouble is, I'm no bloody happier
when I'm winning.

61
00:07:08,527 --> 00:07:09,801
Double or quits?

62
00:07:10,087 --> 00:07:12,237
No, best not.
It’s kitty night tonight.

63
00:07:13,687 --> 00:07:15,757
Cheer up Andy.
It might never happen.

64
00:07:15,927 --> 00:07:18,122
Representatives of union
and management...

65
00:07:18,287 --> 00:07:22,326
meet tonight to discuss the
Grimley redundancy offer.

66
00:07:22,487 --> 00:07:23,715
Bloody going
to though, in't it?

67
00:07:24,207 --> 00:07:25,959
-See you.
-See you.

68
00:07:28,127 --> 00:07:29,845
Don't be a
pillock all your life.

69
00:07:30,007 --> 00:07:31,963
Take t'money
while it's still on offer.

70
00:07:32,127 --> 00:07:36,245
A lot of folk out there wouldn't Like
to hearthe way you're talking, love.

71
00:07:36,407 --> 00:07:38,921
Aye, and they're all as daft
as you are.

72
00:07:39,287 --> 00:07:41,801
All end up with nowt.
Just Like us.

73
00:07:42,647 --> 00:07:43,682
Philip.

74
00:07:46,927 --> 00:07:48,565
Late for practice.

75
00:07:49,087 --> 00:07:52,124
-We'll talk about it later, eh?
-Later?

76
00:07:52,807 --> 00:07:56,163
You’ll still be saying later when
We're out on't bloody street.

77
00:07:58,287 --> 00:08:00,243
There's always Mr. Chuckles.

78
00:08:01,407 --> 00:08:03,682
-I can do more of that.
-Phil?

79
00:08:03,927 --> 00:08:05,679
Phil, Phil.

80
00:08:06,167 --> 00:08:10,046
You have a wife and 4 bloody kids
here, a house nobody'll bloody buy...

81
00:08:10,207 --> 00:08:12,801
mortgaged up to the bloody hilt,
loan-sharks on our backs...

82
00:08:12,967 --> 00:08:16,676
no bloody money, no bloody job,
and what are you going to do?

83
00:08:16,847 --> 00:08:18,200
Fucking juggle?

84
00:08:19,447 --> 00:08:21,563
Bit clumsy with the crockery,
your Sandra.

85
00:08:25,807 --> 00:08:27,957
-All right, love?
-All right.

86
00:09:54,647 --> 00:09:58,162
Crap. That's what that was.
A load of bloody crap.

87
00:09:59,167 --> 00:10:00,839
What did Eric Morecombe say?
All the right notes...

88
00:10:01,007 --> 00:10:03,521
but not necessarily the right order.
What happened to you, son?

89
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:04,597
It just fell apart.

90
00:10:04,767 --> 00:10:07,918
Aye, you're not the only one. Andy
lad, all over the shop, you were.

91
00:10:08,607 --> 00:10:11,167
-What is up with you lot?
-Got our minds on other things, Danny.

92
00:10:11,487 --> 00:10:14,047
-Like what?
-Blimey, you been on holiday or what?

93
00:10:14,607 --> 00:10:15,562
How do you mean?

94
00:10:15,727 --> 00:10:18,878
Well it may've escaped your notice,
Like, but pit's under threat.

95
00:10:19,207 --> 00:10:20,526
What's that
got to do with us?

96
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:24,286
Oh, aye, you're
right, not a lot.

97
00:10:27,007 --> 00:10:30,886
Now listen to me, all of you. These
are worrying times, I know that.

98
00:10:31,207 --> 00:10:34,199
But look what it says here, eh?
1881.

99
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,846
Over a hundred years this band's
been going...

100
00:10:36,007 --> 00:10:38,396
two world wars, three disasters,
seven strikes...

101
00:10:38,567 --> 00:10:41,877
one bloody big depression and t'band
played on every flaming time.

102
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:44,242
Danny, this is t'biggest disaster
of t'lot.

103
00:10:44,807 --> 00:10:47,526
Can't have a colliery band without
a bloody colliery, can you?

104
00:10:47,687 --> 00:10:51,316
Listen. We've got the National Semi
Finals coming up and we're capable...

105
00:10:51,487 --> 00:10:54,285
I mean it, well capable of going
through to London.

106
00:10:54,447 --> 00:10:57,405
The first time in our history.
The Albert Hall.

107
00:10:57,727 --> 00:10:59,524
Now I know there's a spot
of bother at the pit...

108
00:11:00,207 --> 00:11:04,086
but that's something separate. This
is music, and it's music that matters.

109
00:11:07,007 --> 00:11:08,599
Now, come on,
kitty fort'weekend.

110
00:11:10,167 --> 00:11:12,442
Danny, me and Ernie, we've been
thinking it over, Like...

111
00:11:13,247 --> 00:11:14,919
I know subs aren't much, but...

112
00:11:15,087 --> 00:11:17,840
-present climate and that...
-What are you saying, Jim?

113
00:11:18,207 --> 00:11:20,482
Me and Jim have made
a decision, Like.

114
00:11:25,687 --> 00:11:27,564
Hello, love, can we help?

115
00:11:28,607 --> 00:11:31,917
Is this the Colliery Band rehearsal?

116
00:11:32,727 --> 00:11:36,481
No, love, t'band's on Tuesdays.
Tonight's origami class.

117
00:11:36,927 --> 00:11:38,963
Take no notice, fIower.
Can I help?

118
00:11:39,327 --> 00:11:42,797
I'm staying at the pub. I play
the flugel.

119
00:11:43,207 --> 00:11:45,482
Well, sort of dabble.

120
00:11:45,727 --> 00:11:47,080
Mrs. Foggan said...

121
00:11:49,047 --> 00:11:53,120
Well, she said you might let me
play with you.

122
00:11:53,647 --> 00:11:55,205
Down, boy, down.

123
00:11:55,647 --> 00:11:59,162
l know it may sound Like we need all
t'help we can get, but sorry love...

124
00:11:59,327 --> 00:12:01,522
l mean, usually, as a rule,
we don't ...

125
00:12:01,807 --> 00:12:03,923
allow, you know, outsiders.

126
00:12:04,607 --> 00:12:06,723
Aye, I understand that,
except l'm ...

127
00:12:06,887 --> 00:12:09,162
not strictly an outsider. I were
born in GrimIey.

128
00:12:09,527 --> 00:12:11,438
Is that right, Love?
What's your name?

129
00:12:11,887 --> 00:12:12,842
Gloria.

130
00:12:13,647 --> 00:12:15,683
-Gloria...?
-Stits.

131
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:17,596
Glorious tits.

132
00:12:19,487 --> 00:12:19,964
Ernie.

133
00:12:21,567 --> 00:12:24,035
Mullins. Gloria Mullins.

134
00:12:27,207 --> 00:12:28,686
Arthur's Gloria?

135
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:32,081
-You're Danny, aren't you?
-Aye.

136
00:12:33,207 --> 00:12:35,323
-I didn't think you'd still be...
-Alive and kicking?

137
00:12:35,767 --> 00:12:38,600
-Oh aye Love, just about.
-No, l meant leading the band.

138
00:12:38,847 --> 00:12:39,643
Yes.

139
00:12:40,127 --> 00:12:42,402
Well come in, park your bum,
park yourself somewhere.

140
00:12:45,247 --> 00:12:47,966
If you didn't know him, you'd have
heard of him, Arthur Mullins...

141
00:12:48,247 --> 00:12:51,284
this young lady's grandad.
Best bandsman l ever played with.

142
00:12:51,447 --> 00:12:52,766
Bravest miner
I ever worked with.

143
00:12:54,287 --> 00:12:57,643
Closest friend I ever had, till his
lungs packed in '79.

144
00:12:58,647 --> 00:13:00,524
-Sorry, Love.
-It’s true.

145
00:13:01,607 --> 00:13:05,156
Good to see you back. Excuse me a
moment, Gloria, I'm just collecting.

146
00:13:07,167 --> 00:13:10,716
Jim, what were you saying?
Something about t'present climate?

147
00:13:11,407 --> 00:13:13,363
Oh aye, l was saying, Like...

148
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:15,840
despite present climate...

149
00:13:16,047 --> 00:13:18,686
you can always rely on our continued
and whole-hearted...

150
00:13:18,847 --> 00:13:21,407
-support for the cause.
-Oh, aye. Solidarity.

151
00:13:21,687 --> 00:13:23,086
Thick and thin, and all that.

152
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:25,081
Lend us a fiver.

153
00:13:28,647 --> 00:13:30,080
Solidarity.

154
00:13:32,087 --> 00:13:33,679
Do you remember me?

155
00:13:35,527 --> 00:13:39,236
-Barry? Barry Andrews?
-Andy Barrow.

156
00:13:40,127 --> 00:13:41,116
Andy Barrow.

157
00:13:42,967 --> 00:13:45,845
-God, you haven't changed a bit.
-You have.

158
00:13:47,367 --> 00:13:50,882
-What are you up to now, then?
-This and that, y'know, keeping busy.

159
00:13:54,807 --> 00:13:56,365
Hey, that's not...is it?

160
00:13:56,887 --> 00:13:59,765
He left it me in his will. Couldn't
let it go to rust, could I?

161
00:13:59,927 --> 00:14:02,805
Clever old sod. Even when he were
gone he made sure I’d take it up.

162
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:05,720
Well I know it won't be t'same, but
it'd be lovely just to hear it again.

163
00:14:06,447 --> 00:14:08,119
-OK.
-What do you know?

164
00:14:09,087 --> 00:14:11,442
Well, I've been practicing...

165
00:14:11,607 --> 00:14:14,724
-Rodrigo's Concerto D'A ranjuez.
-You what?

166
00:14:15,407 --> 00:14:18,080
-Orange juice to you.
-Oh, aye.

167
00:14:18,767 --> 00:14:20,962
-I'm a bit wobbly still.
-Don't you fret, pet.

168
00:14:21,567 --> 00:14:23,319
Wobbly'd be too
good for this Iot.

169
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:27,759
Paul, the music. Bernie, get her
a stand.

170
00:14:29,607 --> 00:14:31,120
OK, everyone.

171
00:14:33,447 --> 00:14:34,516
All right?

172
00:14:35,487 --> 00:14:36,761
Are we all together?

173
00:14:38,327 --> 00:14:39,680
Andy, Lad, are you with us?

174
00:14:42,287 --> 00:14:45,677
Poor Lad. Still got your mind
on that pit?

175
00:14:49,527 --> 00:14:52,883
All right lads.
Rodrigo's Concerto...

176
00:14:53,047 --> 00:14:54,321
D'Orange Juice.

177
00:18:57,567 --> 00:18:59,205
And she calls that wobbly.

178
00:19:06,767 --> 00:19:08,803
-Well done, lass.
-Well done, love.

179
00:19:09,647 --> 00:19:10,841
Bloody great.

180
00:19:12,847 --> 00:19:15,759
-You doing anything at the weekend?
-No.

181
00:19:16,487 --> 00:19:19,240
Right lads, listen up.
Saddleworth tomorrow.

182
00:19:19,727 --> 00:19:24,084
14 villages, love. Contest in each.
AII at the same time. Cash prizes.

183
00:19:24,527 --> 00:19:26,836
So, any road, lads...

184
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:30,235
big chance to swell the coffers
tomorrow, so...

185
00:19:30,607 --> 00:19:32,518
we're going for all fourteen.

186
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:35,845
-Are you on, love?
-lf I’m allowed.

187
00:19:36,007 --> 00:19:38,760
Don't be soft, lass.
You were born here.

188
00:20:12,847 --> 00:20:15,156
It's a profitable pit, this.

189
00:20:15,767 --> 00:20:17,883
There's hundreds of years of coal
down there...

190
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:22,359
but it doesn't matterto them
bastards. We're making money for'em...

191
00:20:22,527 --> 00:20:25,325
hand over fist, we are.
And still they want to shut us down.

192
00:20:25,847 --> 00:20:29,601
-Well, tell them bollocks to them.
-That's up to you lot isn't it, Lad?

193
00:20:30,287 --> 00:20:32,482
Well, thank Christ
it isn't up to you.

194
00:20:33,687 --> 00:20:37,043
Jesus, we shouldn’t have even let the
offer be put on't table.

195
00:20:37,207 --> 00:20:40,085
They're just bloody puppets, that Lot.
They do whatever the bastards want.

196
00:20:40,247 --> 00:20:44,206
-Phil, Lad.
-We didn't do what they wanted in '84.

197
00:20:44,647 --> 00:20:46,717
No, we dug
us heels in, didn't we?

198
00:20:46,887 --> 00:20:49,242
Aye, and some of us got bloody
locked up for it.

199
00:20:49,407 --> 00:20:50,760
Big bloody deal.

200
00:20:52,007 --> 00:20:53,645
Hey, suspended I were.

201
00:20:53,807 --> 00:20:56,605
It took that lot a year and a half
to get me reinstated.

202
00:20:57,167 --> 00:20:59,522
That's eighteen month on bloody
strike pay.

203
00:20:59,927 --> 00:21:03,476
-With a wife, bloody kids, mortgage.
-It’s ten years ago, pal.

204
00:21:03,847 --> 00:21:05,883
Aye, ten years.

205
00:21:06,127 --> 00:21:08,880
And l were that bloody broke, I’m
still frigging paying for it.

206
00:21:09,047 --> 00:21:11,242
That's how big a fucking deal
it were.

207
00:21:12,327 --> 00:21:14,079
Hey, where were
you then, eh, pal?

208
00:21:14,247 --> 00:21:15,441
In '84?

209
00:21:16,247 --> 00:21:17,521
I don't remember
seeing you on t'line.

210
00:21:18,727 --> 00:21:21,844
Oh aye, we all know which way
you’ll be voting.

211
00:21:22,607 --> 00:21:24,563
-Come on then, you bastard.
-Anytime.

212
00:21:29,047 --> 00:21:30,275
Leave it out.

213
00:21:32,287 --> 00:21:33,163
Listen!

214
00:21:33,887 --> 00:21:36,242
That's just what they're bloody
wanting, you know that, don't you?

215
00:21:38,487 --> 00:21:40,842
AII right, this is what you've got:
ballot next week, right?

216
00:21:41,007 --> 00:21:42,326
You've got two options.

217
00:21:42,487 --> 00:21:45,684
One: you can vote to take pit to
Review Procedure.

218
00:21:46,127 --> 00:21:50,598
Obviously that's one we want, because
we reckon you've got a decent chance.

219
00:21:50,887 --> 00:21:51,797
Or, two...

220
00:21:51,967 --> 00:21:54,083
-You can vote to take pay-off.
-Get stuffed.

221
00:21:55,887 --> 00:21:58,162
Listen, listen. They told us
last night...

222
00:21:58,327 --> 00:22:00,682
that redundancy offer's gone up
three thousand...

223
00:22:00,847 --> 00:22:03,759
from a twenty grand maximum
to twenty three...

224
00:22:04,367 --> 00:22:05,846
with a five grand sweetener.

225
00:22:10,847 --> 00:22:13,645
This is only a temporary offer.

226
00:22:14,847 --> 00:22:19,045
lf you say no, they're pulling any
future offer down to a flat fifteen.

227
00:22:19,407 --> 00:22:20,635
Bastards!

228
00:22:24,207 --> 00:22:26,482
-Born bastards, stay bastards.
-That's right.

229
00:22:26,647 --> 00:22:29,719
Well it's no good shouting now lads,
do it next week in the ballot.

230
00:22:29,887 --> 00:22:32,447
Say no to bloody blackmail...

231
00:22:32,607 --> 00:22:35,246
-and yes to keeping this pit alive.
-That's what we want.

232
00:22:50,807 --> 00:22:53,958
The miners united will never
be defeated.

233
00:22:55,807 --> 00:22:59,197
Poor biddies. Don't they know they're
pissing into t'wind like rest of us?

234
00:23:00,567 --> 00:23:02,478
-Can they do that, women?
-What?

235
00:23:02,927 --> 00:23:05,885
-Piss in the wind.
-No, Ernie, that's just the point.

236
00:23:07,247 --> 00:23:09,920
But even on a nice day, y'know, when
there's no wind about, they can't ...

237
00:23:10,087 --> 00:23:12,396
-y'know, get any direction on it.
-Well all right, whatever it is...

238
00:23:12,567 --> 00:23:15,923
that lasses do that's pointless.
-Bloody hell, so much to choose from.

239
00:23:17,407 --> 00:23:18,840
Fart in a force ten?

240
00:23:19,407 --> 00:23:21,967
My God Phil, you don't half know
some funny women.

241
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:24,642
Steady, Lads,
my missus does that.

242
00:23:26,767 --> 00:23:30,077
Oh you daft bastards.
"Women against Closure"?

243
00:23:33,487 --> 00:23:35,876
That is when she's not farting
in a force ten.

244
00:23:41,647 --> 00:23:43,160
-Morning, love.
-See you.

245
00:23:52,527 --> 00:23:54,324
lf I don't have a day away
on my own...

246
00:23:54,487 --> 00:23:57,923
I’m going to go frigging barmy,
honest I am. I'll kill someone.

247
00:23:58,327 --> 00:24:00,841
-Well, go somewhere tomorrow, eh?
-Phil...

248
00:24:01,007 --> 00:24:03,680
I’m off today,
or I'm off for good.

249
00:24:03,887 --> 00:24:05,286
Give me some money.

250
00:24:06,447 --> 00:24:08,756
-Oh hey love, I’ve only got a tenner.
- Atenner'll do.

251
00:24:11,487 --> 00:24:14,160
But it's Saddleworth, and me dad'll
kill me if l don't turn up.

252
00:24:15,527 --> 00:24:16,926
And l will if you do.

253
00:24:18,487 --> 00:24:19,806
Isn't life just shit?

254
00:24:22,847 --> 00:24:24,200
On your head, Dad?

255
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:32,438
Course the offer's attractive. It’s
tantamount to bribery.

256
00:24:32,607 --> 00:24:35,883
They want Grimley closed, for
whatever reason, nobody knows...

257
00:24:36,047 --> 00:24:39,164
-they think by dangling a carrot...
-This just came for you.

258
00:24:39,487 --> 00:24:41,398
Oh, ta.

259
00:24:42,807 --> 00:24:43,603
Thanks.

260
00:24:44,167 --> 00:24:47,876
They want jobs, a future. They want
an industry, and come the ballot...

261
00:24:48,047 --> 00:24:51,483
-that's what they'll be voting for.
-Yes. That's right.

262
00:25:03,687 --> 00:25:06,645
...the hearing decides the pit has a
sound economic future...

263
00:25:06,807 --> 00:25:10,277
then we shall abide by that decision
and work towards it.

264
00:25:10,647 --> 00:25:14,686
Naturally, l mean, nobody wants
Grimley to close.

265
00:25:18,447 --> 00:25:20,677
Oh I'm bloody
starving, aren't you?

266
00:25:21,807 --> 00:25:23,399
Let's see what we've got.

267
00:25:24,127 --> 00:25:25,719
Dad, who were that?

268
00:25:28,687 --> 00:25:30,359
Just a couple of fellas.

269
00:25:31,327 --> 00:25:35,718
-Are you in trouble, Dad?
-Your dad in trouble?

270
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:38,162
Looked like they were going
to smack you.

271
00:25:39,407 --> 00:25:41,079
Aye, they were lad.

272
00:25:43,607 --> 00:25:47,043
They were from t'council.
Leisure department.

273
00:25:47,527 --> 00:25:50,041
They said that if we don't have
fun today...

274
00:25:50,207 --> 00:25:55,076
-we are in big, big trouble.
-Dad, I'm eight and a half now.

275
00:25:56,647 --> 00:25:57,682
Are you?

276
00:25:58,287 --> 00:26:01,165
Well you can help me find t'bastard
tin opener then, can't you?

277
00:26:02,167 --> 00:26:03,680
Gloria Mullins?

278
00:26:04,567 --> 00:26:07,764
What, Melons Mullins? Lived up Donny
Road? Chubby lass?

279
00:26:08,527 --> 00:26:10,961
We used to sing that hymn: Gloria
in XL.

280
00:26:11,127 --> 00:26:13,038
That's her, except she's
far from chubby now, Like.

281
00:26:13,207 --> 00:26:14,560
Aye, l remember her.

282
00:26:16,727 --> 00:26:20,163
-You had her, behind t'bus station.
-No l never.

283
00:26:20,847 --> 00:26:22,075
You told us you did.

284
00:26:22,607 --> 00:26:25,280
No. It were top half only.

285
00:26:29,007 --> 00:26:30,804
-Does she remember?
-Does she hell as like.

286
00:26:30,967 --> 00:26:33,606
-Couldn't even remember my name.
-Oh, get away.

287
00:26:33,767 --> 00:26:37,476
Bet that's why she's come back.
To complete unfinished business.

288
00:26:43,407 --> 00:26:44,806
What are you smiling at?

289
00:26:45,527 --> 00:26:46,721
Another?

290
00:26:47,927 --> 00:26:49,360
All right, go on then.

291
00:26:52,807 --> 00:26:55,037
What the bleeding hell
are you two doing?

292
00:26:56,327 --> 00:26:57,885
We fancied a game of golf, Like.

293
00:26:58,047 --> 00:27:01,357
You daft gawpheads. You never
resigned, did you?

294
00:27:01,527 --> 00:27:04,599
Sat there like a couple of old
biddies and paid t'money, didn't you?

295
00:27:05,167 --> 00:27:08,842
Old Danny talked us round, like.
He were very persuasive.

296
00:27:09,007 --> 00:27:11,521
-We had no option, lover, honestly.
-No bollocks, more like.

297
00:27:14,087 --> 00:27:16,681
I reckon it were something to do with
bollocks that got us to stay.

298
00:27:17,487 --> 00:27:21,116
-No bloody gumption, them two.
-Soup for brains, the pair of them.

299
00:27:21,287 --> 00:27:24,120
Excuse me, where's the
Collier's Arms?

300
00:27:24,287 --> 00:27:26,084
Hanging off his shoulders, pet.

301
00:27:27,007 --> 00:27:30,238
-The old one's are the best, eh?
-It’s the young ones we worry about.

302
00:27:30,687 --> 00:27:33,247
-Off to Saddleworth, are you?
-That's right.

303
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:37,200
-Follow them two daft 'aporths.
-Ta.

304
00:27:40,127 --> 00:27:41,719
-Hey, love?
-Yeah?

305
00:27:41,887 --> 00:27:45,118
-Joined band last night, did you?
-Yeah. How did you know that?

306
00:27:45,687 --> 00:27:47,678
Just something me husband
never said.

307
00:27:53,527 --> 00:27:54,357
Aye, I am.

308
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:57,396
-What?
-Thinking what you're thinking.

309
00:28:03,087 --> 00:28:04,600
-Eh, up.
-What are you doing?

310
00:28:04,767 --> 00:28:06,644
-Don't sit on that.
-Get off.

311
00:28:13,687 --> 00:28:15,757
-Eh, up, Lads.
-All right?

312
00:28:17,087 --> 00:28:18,361
-Hi Danny,
-Paul.

313
00:28:21,287 --> 00:28:24,484
Oh, tell me you're bloody joking
son, please.

314
00:28:24,647 --> 00:28:28,162
-Sorry. AII of us or none at all.
-Why for Christ's sake?

315
00:28:28,367 --> 00:28:31,439
It were them men from t'Pleasure
Department, Grandad.

316
00:28:32,527 --> 00:28:34,483
-You what?
-Anyway...

317
00:28:34,767 --> 00:28:37,486
nowt wrong with a bit of vocal
support, eh?

318
00:28:41,687 --> 00:28:44,997
-l hope you feel as good as you look.
-I’m nervous.

319
00:28:45,767 --> 00:28:48,884
Get away with you. Your grandad would
be proud of you. Go on, in you get.

320
00:28:51,847 --> 00:28:55,237
-Eh, up Gloria.
-Hey oggle-eyes, is that the lot?

321
00:28:55,407 --> 00:28:57,238
No, no, no there's ...

322
00:28:57,727 --> 00:29:00,525
There's one more,
as per bloody usual.

323
00:29:00,967 --> 00:29:02,002
Poor lass.

324
00:29:02,167 --> 00:29:05,000
All she wants is a nice day out and
she gets stuck between them 2 buggers.

325
00:29:07,847 --> 00:29:10,884
Shit.
Oh, sorry Harry.

326
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:14,244
-Come here, darling
-Thanks a lot, Kylie.

327
00:29:15,927 --> 00:29:19,840
There you go, mate. What
were all that about?

328
00:29:20,047 --> 00:29:24,165
Here comes Fast bloody Eddie now.
Come on Andy lad. Step on it.

329
00:29:25,247 --> 00:29:26,043
Sorry.

330
00:29:28,807 --> 00:29:32,516
-AII right Stanley, that's the lot.
-What about these two here?

331
00:29:34,887 --> 00:29:35,683
Bloody hell.

332
00:29:35,847 --> 00:29:38,566
Don't look Like that, Danny lad.
It’s nearest colours we could find.

333
00:29:38,727 --> 00:29:40,638
-What are you doing?
-We've just founded t'fan club.

334
00:29:40,807 --> 00:29:42,081
Well l don't think we...

335
00:29:42,407 --> 00:29:45,319
Look ladies, l mean, this is
traditionally a...

336
00:29:45,767 --> 00:29:48,964
-male only excursion. You know that.
-New Lass on board, is she?

337
00:29:50,047 --> 00:29:54,404
Aye. That's different.
I mean, she's very talented.

338
00:29:54,887 --> 00:29:56,843
Aye, l know, we saw her.

339
00:29:57,007 --> 00:29:59,965
I’ll have you know, that girl blows
flugeI Like a dream.

340
00:30:00,287 --> 00:30:03,359
Danny Ormondroyd!
At your age!

341
00:30:07,807 --> 00:30:10,640
Come on love, it's not
"What's my line?" .

342
00:30:12,087 --> 00:30:15,124
Well, I’m a surveyor.

343
00:30:15,887 --> 00:30:19,084
Blimey. What, you mean like a
quantity surveyor?

344
00:30:19,287 --> 00:30:21,847
-Kind of.
-Want to survey my quantity, Love?

345
00:30:23,847 --> 00:30:25,963
Well I do say
"no job too small" .

346
00:30:27,727 --> 00:30:30,321
Get away love. Take you a bloody
fortnight, this one.

347
00:30:34,687 --> 00:30:36,917
We had no option,
lover, honest.

348
00:30:38,447 --> 00:30:39,766
Shift up, duck.

349
00:30:40,567 --> 00:30:42,683
Eh, up Phil, groupies are on.

350
00:30:44,207 --> 00:30:45,879
Sex, drugs and rock and roll,
eh girls?

351
00:30:46,047 --> 00:30:48,481
Aye, except we can do without
drugs and rock and roll.

352
00:33:51,807 --> 00:33:55,243
Laughing. They were bloody
laughing at us.

353
00:33:56,767 --> 00:34:01,363
Look at them. If they were alive
today, they'd turn in their graves.

354
00:34:01,567 --> 00:34:05,685
And if Arthur Mullins was looking
down on us, well God bloody help us.

355
00:34:06,327 --> 00:34:08,158
l mean,
is this what it's come to?

356
00:34:08,607 --> 00:34:10,677
Bits of trombone flying
all over t'shop?

357
00:34:10,847 --> 00:34:13,236
Stopping t'march to change
bloody nappies?

358
00:34:13,727 --> 00:34:16,480
Too bloody bewied to stay on
t'buggering bandstand.

359
00:34:16,647 --> 00:34:19,400
We may as well
all bloody give up.

360
00:34:19,567 --> 00:34:21,000
I reckon we
already have, Dan.

361
00:34:21,447 --> 00:34:22,846
That's kind of why it went
like it did.

362
00:34:23,367 --> 00:34:25,164
Reckon we thought we'd go out
on a high note.

363
00:34:25,687 --> 00:34:28,679
Happen our idea of a high note's a
bit different from yours, like.

364
00:34:28,927 --> 00:34:31,725
Go out? What are you talking about
Ernie, go out?

365
00:34:31,887 --> 00:34:33,320
Danny lad,
you've got to face it.

366
00:34:33,687 --> 00:34:36,599
-lf pit goes, band goes with it.
-When pit goes.

367
00:34:37,247 --> 00:34:37,997
If.

368
00:34:40,167 --> 00:34:41,998
However ballot goes, they’ll
still close the bugger.

369
00:34:42,167 --> 00:34:43,885
Not necessarily.
It depends on the...

370
00:34:46,407 --> 00:34:48,557
On that review thingy.

371
00:34:49,567 --> 00:34:50,556
Surely?

372
00:34:51,527 --> 00:34:53,358
Trouble with you lot is you've
got no pride.

373
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:57,880
And you know one thing more than owt
else here that symbolizes pride?

374
00:34:58,047 --> 00:35:01,483
It's this bloody band,
that's what. Ask anybody.

375
00:35:02,087 --> 00:35:05,238
l mean, if they close down the pit,
knock it down...

376
00:35:05,407 --> 00:35:08,205
fill it up, Like they've done with
all t'bloody rest, no trace.

377
00:35:08,367 --> 00:35:11,245
Years to come, there’ll only be one
reminder...

378
00:35:11,447 --> 00:35:15,599
Of hundred bloody years hard graft:
this bloody band.

379
00:35:16,287 --> 00:35:19,006
Oh, they can shut up the unions,
they can shut up the workers...

380
00:35:19,167 --> 00:35:21,601
but I'll tell you one thing for
nothing, they'll never shut us up.

381
00:35:22,007 --> 00:35:26,603
We'll play on. Loud as ever. Starting
with National Semis in Halifax.

382
00:35:26,767 --> 00:35:29,679
Win them and we can carry
our heads high and march...

383
00:35:29,847 --> 00:35:31,678
on to the Albert bloody Hall,
all right?

384
00:35:32,167 --> 00:35:35,079
-Are we playing or are we packing in?
-Playing.

385
00:35:39,927 --> 00:35:40,962
Sorry.

386
00:35:41,887 --> 00:35:43,286
No, don't you worry, flower.

387
00:35:44,047 --> 00:35:45,685
You've nowt to be ashamed of.

388
00:35:47,767 --> 00:35:49,041
No bugger else, then?

389
00:35:53,247 --> 00:35:55,681
Danny, l reckon l speak
for everybody.

390
00:35:56,647 --> 00:35:58,126
We'll play on while pit's open...

391
00:35:58,607 --> 00:36:01,519
-Minute they close it, we pack it in.
-Aye, right.

392
00:36:01,687 --> 00:36:04,326
-You can't ask for more than that.
-Hear hear.

393
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:07,043
No.

394
00:36:08,847 --> 00:36:09,836
Obviously not.

395
00:36:28,567 --> 00:36:30,398
-Hiya.
-Hiya.

396
00:36:31,167 --> 00:36:32,486
Moving words.

397
00:36:33,607 --> 00:36:36,041
-What?
-Back there. Danny.

398
00:36:36,207 --> 00:36:39,404
Aye, daft old codger. lf it weren't
for band, he'd pop his clogs.

399
00:36:39,567 --> 00:36:43,196
I wondered if you fancied some grub?
-Where?

400
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:45,323
-Don't know. I’ll go posh if you want.
-Andy.

401
00:36:45,487 --> 00:36:46,761
All right, Phil.

402
00:36:46,927 --> 00:36:49,725
-Have you seen me dad?
-Aye he's still inside, I think.

403
00:36:51,367 --> 00:36:53,164
-Well?
-All right.

404
00:37:07,007 --> 00:37:08,360
You all right, Dad?

405
00:37:12,487 --> 00:37:14,682
Thank you for
your support, son.

406
00:37:20,367 --> 00:37:22,323
Oh, Listen, Phil lad.

407
00:37:23,367 --> 00:37:24,846
I've been thinking, right...

408
00:37:26,407 --> 00:37:29,240
Semi-Final's no place for

409
00:37:29,527 --> 00:37:31,279
Better find yourself
a new bit of brass.

410
00:37:32,607 --> 00:37:35,724
I'm not forking out for a new
trombone just for one performance.

411
00:37:35,887 --> 00:37:38,082
One?
What about the Albert Hall?

412
00:37:39,967 --> 00:37:42,356
Now normally I’d say get summat
cheap, but...

413
00:37:43,327 --> 00:37:46,205
but you're a bloody good trombonist
lad, you need a bloody good trombone.

414
00:37:46,367 --> 00:37:47,163
Dad...

415
00:37:48,807 --> 00:37:52,686
l like the band. I love the band,
we all do.

416
00:37:53,887 --> 00:37:58,802
But there's other things in Life,
you know, that's more important.

417
00:38:01,967 --> 00:38:03,525
Not in mine, there isn't .

418
00:38:07,727 --> 00:38:09,206
What's that on your hankie?

419
00:38:13,007 --> 00:38:14,156
Oh, nowt.

420
00:38:15,607 --> 00:38:17,165
Chain come off me bike.

421
00:38:48,007 --> 00:38:50,999
Didn't realize we were going this
posh, I'd have got dolled up.

422
00:38:59,807 --> 00:39:02,560
You know back there, when Danny said
you'd nowt to be ashamed of?

423
00:39:03,407 --> 00:39:04,681
Is that right, then?

424
00:39:09,167 --> 00:39:10,680
You work for bloody management
don't you?

425
00:39:12,807 --> 00:39:14,286
-Andy, I'm just...
-Fuck.

426
00:39:14,447 --> 00:39:18,406
l just compile surveys, Andy, just do
viability studies, boring, maybe...

427
00:39:18,567 --> 00:39:20,398
-but hardly summat to be ashamed of.
-No?

428
00:39:20,727 --> 00:39:24,481
-Kept very quiet about it.
-Cause I knew you'd get it all wrong.

429
00:39:24,647 --> 00:39:27,684
-Oh, aye?
-I’m on the same side as you, Andy.

430
00:39:28,287 --> 00:39:31,199
l want Grimley to stay open too, and
once it gets to review...

431
00:39:31,367 --> 00:39:33,881
-I can help it stay open with my report.
-Bollocks.

432
00:39:34,327 --> 00:39:37,558
My figures show GrimIey has a future,
it's a profitable pit.

433
00:39:37,727 --> 00:39:40,958
They know that. It’ll never reach
review. The lads'll go for redundancy.

434
00:39:41,207 --> 00:39:43,118
And that's another thing that you
lot know...

435
00:39:43,287 --> 00:39:44,925
just how much to offer
to get a result.

436
00:39:45,087 --> 00:39:48,875
Every miner I’ve spoken to is
voting to stay put.

437
00:39:49,047 --> 00:39:51,038
Do you think they'd tell you
any different?

438
00:39:51,687 --> 00:39:53,757
Four to one
it’ll go for pay-off.

439
00:39:53,927 --> 00:39:56,122
-You're voting to stay put?
-Course l bloody am.

440
00:39:56,647 --> 00:39:57,966
Then you must
have some hope.

441
00:39:58,727 --> 00:40:00,957
No hope.
Just principles.

442
00:40:02,647 --> 00:40:03,966
It's your first job for them,
isn't it?

443
00:40:04,127 --> 00:40:08,086
Otherwise you'd know that your report
means as much as we do. Bugger all.

444
00:40:08,727 --> 00:40:10,683
It’s just a
bloody PR exercise.

445
00:40:10,847 --> 00:40:13,486
So blind, naive people, people not
unlike yourself...

446
00:40:13,647 --> 00:40:16,081
will think those good eggs at Head
Office have been very fair...

447
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:18,283
very reasonable. Done
their best, done their sums...

448
00:40:18,447 --> 00:40:20,677
and, oh dear, they
just don't add up.

449
00:40:20,927 --> 00:40:22,997
They'll have to close another pit.
Shame.

450
00:40:24,287 --> 00:40:25,925
They won't even
read the bugger.

451
00:40:26,487 --> 00:40:29,479
They've already made their decision,
probably when you were at college.

452
00:40:30,127 --> 00:40:31,845
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

453
00:40:33,727 --> 00:40:37,356
Anyway, if my job's so bloody
irrelevant...

454
00:40:37,567 --> 00:40:39,364
how come you
hate me so much?

455
00:40:40,967 --> 00:40:42,241
l don't have you, I...

456
00:40:46,247 --> 00:40:48,158
-Who's the haddock?
-She is.

457
00:40:57,767 --> 00:40:59,678
l chose Grimley, you know.

458
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:03,119
They offered me other pits, but l
chose Grimley for two reasons.

459
00:41:03,607 --> 00:41:07,998
Because if I could help keep one pit
alive, I wanted it to be this one.

460
00:41:08,527 --> 00:41:09,323
Second...

461
00:41:12,967 --> 00:41:14,082
Hey, isn't that...

462
00:41:15,007 --> 00:41:17,157
where the old bus station was?

463
00:41:18,247 --> 00:41:20,681
-l didn't think you'd remember.
-How could I forget?

464
00:41:21,487 --> 00:41:23,762
I'm sorry. Fumblings of a fourteen
year old.

465
00:41:23,927 --> 00:41:26,316
What did we call it?
Top half only.

466
00:41:27,167 --> 00:41:30,637
Can hardly have been worth it
at that age. Just kids.

467
00:41:31,687 --> 00:41:35,282
-I’d get better value now.
-Well that's inflation for you.

468
00:41:41,527 --> 00:41:43,279
l did know your name,
you know.

469
00:41:44,247 --> 00:41:46,078
When l called you
Barry Andrews.

470
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:48,645
l just didn’t want
you to think...

471
00:41:49,487 --> 00:41:50,636
I don't know.

472
00:41:51,767 --> 00:41:53,997
That it was etched forever
on me brain.

473
00:41:55,407 --> 00:41:56,840
'Cause it hasn't been,
has it?

474
00:42:05,007 --> 00:42:07,475
Do you want to come
up for a coffee?

475
00:42:08,047 --> 00:42:09,480
l don't drink coffee.

476
00:42:11,647 --> 00:42:13,046
I haven't got any.

477
00:42:36,127 --> 00:42:38,766
-Eh up, Phil.
-Jesus Christ.

478
00:42:38,927 --> 00:42:41,122
Did you Like it so much you want
to go back?

479
00:42:41,687 --> 00:42:43,757
-What?
-WakefieId Prison?

480
00:42:44,527 --> 00:42:47,758
-What are you on about?
-Shall we call it a day, eh?

481
00:42:58,487 --> 00:42:59,681
Evening, love.

482
00:43:00,847 --> 00:43:01,996
Night.

483
00:43:32,167 --> 00:43:34,681
All right, Andy lad. What've you
been up to?

484
00:43:35,567 --> 00:43:37,444
A bit of extra
practice, like.

485
00:43:38,807 --> 00:43:41,082
-You're a genius you, aren't you?
-What?

486
00:43:41,567 --> 00:43:44,161
Well, it takes a special talent that,
practicing...

487
00:43:44,727 --> 00:43:47,958
-without your instrument.
-l must've left it in there, I’ll...

488
00:43:48,127 --> 00:43:50,083
-I’ll pick it up tomorrow.
-Right.

489
00:43:51,647 --> 00:43:53,126
Gloria on good form,
is she?

490
00:43:55,927 --> 00:43:58,282
-Night, Andy lad.
-Night, Danny.

491
00:46:23,527 --> 00:46:25,677
Mr. MacKenzie, could l have a
quick word?

492
00:46:25,847 --> 00:46:27,678
Well, I’m actually rather busy,
Gloria.

493
00:46:27,847 --> 00:46:31,157
Yes, so am l. l just wanted to make
sure l wasn't busy for no reason.

494
00:46:31,327 --> 00:46:34,160
It's just some of the information
l need...

495
00:46:34,327 --> 00:46:35,919
it's Like getting blood out of
a stone.

496
00:46:36,087 --> 00:46:38,203
I feel Like I'm flogging a dead
horse sometimes and I...

497
00:46:38,367 --> 00:46:40,835
Shall we stop talking in riddles,
Gloria?

498
00:46:43,167 --> 00:46:46,955
I'm worried that my report
may be sort of...

499
00:46:48,607 --> 00:46:49,483
immaterial.

500
00:46:50,487 --> 00:46:51,761
Your report is vital...

501
00:46:52,847 --> 00:46:54,644
absolutely paramount.

502
00:46:55,127 --> 00:46:57,004
lf this pit goes to review,
and we hope it will...

503
00:46:57,767 --> 00:47:01,601
we have crucial decisions to make and
we can't make them without detailed...

504
00:47:01,767 --> 00:47:05,396
accurate reports from highly
qualified people such as yourself.

505
00:47:08,247 --> 00:47:10,044
It’s a tricky business, Gloria.

506
00:47:10,487 --> 00:47:12,318
AII we want to do
is get it right.

507
00:47:13,567 --> 00:47:14,363
Okay?

508
00:47:22,687 --> 00:47:23,483
Yeah.

509
00:47:31,487 --> 00:47:34,684
Eh up, Andy. Look, there's your mate,
Miss Glorious Tits.

510
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:36,566
What's she doing here?

511
00:47:49,647 --> 00:47:52,559
Now then, what's a nice girl like you
doing in a horrible place like this?

512
00:47:52,927 --> 00:47:54,440
Oh, hiya.

513
00:47:55,967 --> 00:47:56,956
Hi, Andy.

514
00:47:58,207 --> 00:47:59,003
Hiya.

515
00:47:59,367 --> 00:48:03,519
-l came up to meet Andy out of work.
-He's not out of work yet, love.

516
00:48:04,247 --> 00:48:05,521
Come back next week.

517
00:48:05,687 --> 00:48:07,325
l just wondered if you wanted a
quick practice, Andy?

518
00:48:07,487 --> 00:48:09,682
No he can't Love. He's going
for a pint with us.

519
00:48:10,127 --> 00:48:12,197
-Oh, right, well...
-See you.

520
00:48:14,247 --> 00:48:17,683
That's all right, isn't it Andy?
Nice pint and a chat.

521
00:48:18,847 --> 00:48:21,361
We can talk about
price of fish...

522
00:48:21,767 --> 00:48:23,644
plight of t'T hird WorId...

523
00:48:23,927 --> 00:48:26,316
pros and cons
of t'sweeper system...

524
00:48:26,487 --> 00:48:29,843
and why your bird's got management
Iogo on her key-ring.

525
00:48:39,887 --> 00:48:42,321
Still, it doesn't make her the
devil incarnate, does it?

526
00:48:42,487 --> 00:48:44,364
What does it make Andy here?
That's what I want to know.

527
00:48:44,527 --> 00:48:47,166
Lay off him, eh, Jim. He said he
didn't know.

528
00:48:47,727 --> 00:48:49,080
With legs like that round
your back...

529
00:48:49,247 --> 00:48:51,522
you don't stop and ask for
a reference, do you?

530
00:48:51,687 --> 00:48:53,962
-It’s a mistake anyone could've made.
-Aye...

531
00:48:54,127 --> 00:48:55,480
and by hell, we all wish we'd
made it.

532
00:48:55,647 --> 00:48:58,878
-This isn't funny.
-Nowt wrong with shagging management.

533
00:48:59,607 --> 00:49:01,484
They've been shagging
us long enough.

534
00:49:02,927 --> 00:49:05,521
Oh, don't tell me Andy. It weren’t
shagging...

535
00:49:05,847 --> 00:49:07,599
it were true love.

536
00:49:09,927 --> 00:49:13,158
-Are you playing, Andy?
-No. He's had enough fun for one week.

537
00:49:13,807 --> 00:49:15,240
I'm not a kid
anymore, Jim, right?

538
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:17,117
Oh, aye?

539
00:49:18,007 --> 00:49:19,804
-Old enough to be a scab, then.
-Jim.

540
00:49:25,607 --> 00:49:27,199
It’s right, Andy,
he doesn't mean it.

541
00:49:27,367 --> 00:49:29,085
You don't mess around
with words Like that.

542
00:49:29,247 --> 00:49:31,681
Aye, I’m sorry, Andy.
Take it back.

543
00:49:32,487 --> 00:49:34,159
You’re just a stupid fucker.

544
00:49:37,167 --> 00:49:38,680
That's more Like it.

545
00:49:46,487 --> 00:49:48,159
I’ll catch you later, lads.

546
00:49:49,647 --> 00:49:51,080
Where are you off, then?

547
00:49:56,367 --> 00:50:00,360
Hello, kids.
My name's Mr. Chuckles.

548
00:50:00,527 --> 00:50:03,280
Hello, Mr. Chuckles.

549
00:50:03,447 --> 00:50:04,926
-Now, do you like card tricks?
-Yeah.

550
00:50:05,087 --> 00:50:06,725
Will you help me with this
card trick?

551
00:50:06,887 --> 00:50:09,162
Come here, come here. Now,
what you have to do...

552
00:50:09,327 --> 00:50:11,682
is pick a card from there.
Don't let me see it.

553
00:50:11,847 --> 00:50:14,281
And show it to all your friends so
that they can all see it.

554
00:50:14,607 --> 00:50:16,723
Now put it back
anywhere you Like.

555
00:50:17,247 --> 00:50:19,556
Tell me when you've
done it. Done it?

556
00:50:19,727 --> 00:50:21,957
Now I’m going to shuffle them all up.
Did you see what the card was?

557
00:50:22,127 --> 00:50:26,757
Don't tell me.
The card was the Jack of Hearts.

558
00:50:26,927 --> 00:50:28,121
No.

559
00:50:29,047 --> 00:50:31,163
-Queen of Clubs?
-No.

560
00:50:31,327 --> 00:50:33,318
-What were it then?
-Ace of Spades.

561
00:50:33,487 --> 00:50:34,602
Correct!

562
00:50:36,767 --> 00:50:38,280
All right now, Scott.

563
00:50:38,527 --> 00:50:41,917
I'm going to put your watch there and
I’m going to fold this over...

564
00:50:42,287 --> 00:50:47,884
Once, twice, three times, four.
Just Like that. AII right.

565
00:50:48,687 --> 00:50:53,283
And, with this hammer, Scott,
l want you to give that watch...

566
00:50:53,447 --> 00:50:56,837
-a great big smack.
-No.

567
00:50:59,367 --> 00:51:02,677
When l say
the magic words, Scott.

568
00:51:05,047 --> 00:51:08,642
-This isn't your main job, is it?
-I’m a miner.

569
00:51:09,887 --> 00:51:11,036
A miner?

570
00:51:13,687 --> 00:51:17,282
You remember them, Love,
dinosaurs, dodos...

571
00:51:18,207 --> 00:51:19,322
miners.

572
00:51:33,287 --> 00:51:36,085
-Sorry Sandra, you're a bit short.
-How much?

573
00:51:36,287 --> 00:51:38,198
-One fitty.
-What's up with you?

574
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:39,766
What's it to be?

575
00:51:40,247 --> 00:51:42,681
-What about them aeroplane things?
-What?

576
00:51:42,967 --> 00:51:46,164
-Them things with wings on?
-No, l need them.

577
00:51:48,167 --> 00:51:50,397
Here you are, Love, put that back.
We'll use soap.

578
00:51:50,887 --> 00:51:54,596
Sorry, Vera. Me and sums, not what
you'd call the best of friends.

579
00:51:54,767 --> 00:51:56,758
Me and money, total frigging
strangers.

580
00:51:57,487 --> 00:51:59,079
Sorry Love.
Still need another sixty.

581
00:52:01,567 --> 00:52:04,081
l tell you what, give it us next
week, all right?

582
00:52:04,247 --> 00:52:05,043
Are you sure?

583
00:52:07,407 --> 00:52:08,681
Don't forget your receipt.

584
00:52:20,367 --> 00:52:21,766
-Come on.
-See you, love.

585
00:52:30,527 --> 00:52:32,006
Get back in
here now with that.

586
00:52:32,167 --> 00:52:34,237
-Who do you think you bleeding are?
-Get off.

587
00:52:35,167 --> 00:52:36,486
-Hey.
-Bastard.

588
00:52:38,887 --> 00:52:40,445
Come here, you bastards.

589
00:52:41,367 --> 00:52:43,085
What do you think
you're fucking doing?

590
00:52:43,247 --> 00:52:44,760
What do you think you're
fucking playing at?

591
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:47,885
l told you, pal. It's pay day.

592
00:52:51,167 --> 00:52:52,361
Yeah, all right.

593
00:52:53,967 --> 00:52:54,843
Right.

594
00:52:56,567 --> 00:52:58,558
Just give us a
bit of time, eh?

595
00:52:59,087 --> 00:53:02,284
It's been ten years mate.
Pay day's pay day, pal.

596
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:04,439
Especially when it's
twelve grand.

597
00:53:04,607 --> 00:53:06,916
-Twelve?
-Aye, it's that interest, isn't it?

598
00:53:07,087 --> 00:53:08,805
-It's a bugger.
-Well, what about...

599
00:53:10,847 --> 00:53:12,963
-Can you wait till twenty first?
-Twenty first?

600
00:53:13,127 --> 00:53:15,277
Oh, aye.
Coco the scab, eh?

601
00:53:17,247 --> 00:53:19,556
-We'll be back with truck.
-Truck? What for?

602
00:53:19,927 --> 00:53:20,803
Contents.

603
00:53:21,367 --> 00:53:22,846
Until you pay up, like.

604
00:53:28,607 --> 00:53:33,078
lf you touch my kids again,
I’ll fucking kill you.

605
00:53:44,087 --> 00:53:46,237
What the frigging hell's this?

606
00:53:47,407 --> 00:53:50,479
It’s a frigging dent, that's
what it is.

607
00:53:53,287 --> 00:53:55,084
Andy Barrow lent it me.

608
00:53:56,927 --> 00:53:58,679
He’ll go frigging barmy.

609
00:54:21,447 --> 00:54:25,122
-Hiya, Danny love. You well?
-Oh, aye, can't complain, Betty.

610
00:54:25,287 --> 00:54:29,200
-What time do they announce result?
-About five-ish or summat, l think.

611
00:54:29,367 --> 00:54:32,359
-l didn't know you were that bothered.
-Whole town's bothered, Love.

612
00:54:33,967 --> 00:54:35,480
Can't do without pit.

613
00:54:36,967 --> 00:54:39,640
l thought you were talking
about Semi-Finals.

614
00:54:39,807 --> 00:54:42,082
Honest, Danny,
a day Like today...

615
00:54:42,247 --> 00:54:45,080
You think anyone's interested in
some daft football match?

616
00:54:49,887 --> 00:54:50,603
All right, love?

617
00:54:50,767 --> 00:54:53,327
That's it. You bugger off and blow
your bloody trumpet.

618
00:54:53,487 --> 00:54:55,284
Blimey, a conversation.

619
00:54:56,407 --> 00:54:58,557
Harry, in a month's time when you're
at home all day and there's ...

620
00:54:58,727 --> 00:55:02,276
nowt but dole coming in, at least
l can know that I did summat.

621
00:55:02,687 --> 00:55:05,804
It weren't much, but it were best l
could do and at least it were summat.

622
00:55:05,967 --> 00:55:07,286
What are you on about?

623
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:13,685
Ten years ago before the strike,
you were so full of fight.

624
00:55:14,127 --> 00:55:16,083
Packed full of passion,
you were.

625
00:55:17,407 --> 00:55:19,602
Now you just do nowt.

626
00:55:20,727 --> 00:55:23,685
AII you do is blow your bloody
trumpet.

627
00:55:24,127 --> 00:55:25,526
Aye, but at least...

628
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:28,681
At least what?

629
00:55:30,607 --> 00:55:32,086
People listen to us.

630
00:55:36,967 --> 00:55:38,525
Go on, sod off.

631
00:55:45,007 --> 00:55:47,316
And it's
a bloody euphonium.

632
00:55:51,887 --> 00:55:56,085
You know, l can't tell a lie. I were
never one for brass bands before.

633
00:55:56,807 --> 00:56:00,880
But when you hear that sound, when
you're near that sound...

634
00:56:01,607 --> 00:56:05,156
-doesn't half grab you, doesn't it?
-Aye, it does that.

635
00:56:06,007 --> 00:56:10,637
But you know, folk like Danny,
it's taken over their lives.

636
00:56:11,207 --> 00:56:13,163
I'd never Let that happen.

637
00:56:20,327 --> 00:56:22,477
-Gorgeous.
-Oh, yeah.

638
00:56:24,967 --> 00:56:26,116
AII right, Bernard.

639
00:56:28,847 --> 00:56:30,166
-Jim, Ernie.
-Danny.

640
00:56:36,727 --> 00:56:38,240
-Hi, Danny.
-Hello, Danny.

641
00:56:39,727 --> 00:56:43,356
Bloody hell. Hi, Harry.
Make an effort, Andy.

642
00:56:47,287 --> 00:56:49,960
Bloody hell, son.
What's happened to you?

643
00:56:50,127 --> 00:56:51,355
Sorry, Dad.

644
00:56:52,207 --> 00:56:55,085
-Bit of a domestic, Like.
-But you know this is a special...

645
00:56:57,247 --> 00:56:59,317
Sandra did that?
To you?

646
00:57:00,207 --> 00:57:01,003
No.

647
00:57:05,607 --> 00:57:07,677
Go on, get on t'bus.
Get it cleaned up.

648
00:57:09,727 --> 00:57:12,195
Bang goes the Deportment Prize,
any road.

649
00:57:27,767 --> 00:57:31,680
We're going to win this one. Look.
Your Phil's got a new trombone.

650
00:57:36,127 --> 00:57:37,242

Four to one, Harry.

659
01:03:19,287 --> 01:03:20,083
Still...

01:03:22,007 --> 01:03:23,963

each other now.

661
01:03:32,727 --> 01:03:33,603
Dad?

662
01:03:42,287 --> 01:03:43,879
Oh, Jesus Christ.

663
01:03:45,327 --> 01:03:47,682
Will someone get
an ambulance, quick!

664
01:03:48,607 --> 01:03:50,563
Hurry, he can't breathe.

665
01:03:50,727 --> 01:03:53,082
-Just back off, will you?
-Don't crowd him.

666
01:03:55,607 --> 01:03:58,838
-Come on, breathe for me.
-Someone call for that ambulance?

667
01:03:59,007 --> 01:04:01,043
Come on,
I've got you. Phil's here.

668
01:04:01,927 --> 01:04:03,963
Come on,
hurry up, will you?

669
01:04:10,087 --> 01:04:11,202
How is he, Phil?

670
01:04:11,807 --> 01:04:14,367
I don't know.
He hasn't woke up yet.

671
01:04:15,527 --> 01:04:18,644
They just said there'd be more
news tomorrow.

672
01:04:18,847 --> 01:04:21,281
Right. We're just having
a collection for him.

673
01:04:25,647 --> 01:04:27,000
You still here, love?

674
01:04:27,927 --> 01:04:29,679
I reckon it's got to be ta-ra now,
don't you?

675
01:04:41,887 --> 01:04:45,163
I’m on your side.

676
01:04:55,327 --> 01:04:56,476
Andy?

677
01:05:03,967 --> 01:05:05,082
Andy.

678
01:05:10,727 --> 01:05:11,796
Phil, Lad.

679
01:05:15,967 --> 01:05:19,676
Not flowers, all right, Jim.
Not grapes.

680
01:05:20,607 --> 01:05:22,598
Get him summat he wants, eh?

681
01:05:25,727 --> 01:05:28,480
You sure about this, Andy mate?
What about t'finals?

682
01:05:32,047 --> 01:05:33,526
What finals?

683
01:05:47,967 --> 01:05:50,686
Andy, l don't
want to fall out, mate.

684
01:05:51,447 --> 01:05:53,244
You're me main
source of income.

685
01:05:53,807 --> 01:05:57,482
Don't worry, Simmo. I’ve lost more
this week than a bloody trumpet.

686
01:06:09,087 --> 01:06:10,156
Sandra?

687
01:06:11,287 --> 01:06:13,642
They came.
Took bloody lot.

688
01:06:14,007 --> 01:06:17,204
-I warned you, Phil.
-Oh, Sand, no. I...

689
01:06:17,767 --> 01:06:18,802
Look don't ...

690
01:06:20,447 --> 01:06:21,562
Not now.

691
01:06:22,327 --> 01:06:25,876
Seems as good a time as any. What
with there being nowhere to sit.

692
01:06:26,847 --> 01:06:28,678
Dad's collapsed.

693
01:06:29,527 --> 01:06:30,846
Aye, I heard.

694
01:06:33,607 --> 01:06:34,960
I’m sorry, Phil.

695
01:07:15,647 --> 01:07:17,205
Oh, you fuckers.

696
01:07:29,127 --> 01:07:31,277
-Sandra?
<-Phil? Harry.

697
01:07:32,327 --> 01:07:34,602
Are you set for one
final performance?

698
01:07:50,607 --> 01:07:52,086
What on earth?

699
01:08:43,287 --> 01:08:46,438
Nurse, go down there at once
and get rid of them.

700
01:08:46,607 --> 01:08:48,165
Leave them be.

701
01:08:50,167 --> 01:08:54,046
-Mr. Ormondroyd, how are you feeling?
-Death's door.

702
01:08:55,127 --> 01:08:59,006
-The bastards still take the piss.
-Yes, l am sorry about this racket.

703
01:08:59,167 --> 01:09:01,806
-We'll stop it, don't worry.
-Stop this racket?

704
01:09:01,967 --> 01:09:04,083
You'll wake up
in the next ward.

705
01:09:36,967 --> 01:09:39,162
Is it going Like
shit off a shovel?

706
01:09:40,487 --> 01:09:43,684
lf by that you mean fast,
yes it is, rather.

707
01:09:46,567 --> 01:09:49,001
It always does when they play
this one.

708
01:10:59,527 --> 01:11:01,677
Message from
Mr. Ormondroyd.

709
01:11:02,487 --> 01:11:04,478
-He's awake?
-Yeah.

710
01:11:04,847 --> 01:11:07,077
He says tenor
horn's too soft.

711
01:11:15,167 --> 01:11:18,955
Phil Lad, I reckon it'd be best
coming from you.

712
01:11:19,647 --> 01:11:23,686
About us packing in.
Not going to t'finals.

713
01:11:29,487 --> 01:11:32,763
You shouldn’t have, you know, Lads.
Really. Should’ve brought me...

714
01:11:32,927 --> 01:11:34,918
flowers or summat.

715
01:11:35,087 --> 01:11:38,682
Grapes. I could murder a
bunch of grapes.

716
01:11:43,807 --> 01:11:48,198
-Bloody hell.
-Right thank you. The concert's over.

717
01:11:48,367 --> 01:11:50,562
It’s past eleven
and Mr. Ormondroyd...

718
01:11:50,727 --> 01:11:53,082
must have some sleep. Thank you.
-See you, Danny.

719
01:11:53,247 --> 01:11:56,683
And I'd prefer any future visits to
be made in visiting hours...

720
01:11:57,007 --> 01:12:00,397
-preferably without trumpets.
-It’s a euphonium.

721
01:12:00,967 --> 01:12:03,242
Hey lads,
sounded good, mind...

722
01:12:03,687 --> 01:12:08,078
Out there. Keep playing Like that and
we’ll murder them at bloody finals.

723
01:12:12,807 --> 01:12:14,035
Tell him.

724
01:12:25,007 --> 01:12:26,998
You in a bit of trouble, son?

725
01:12:27,927 --> 01:12:31,681
-It's nowt, Dad.
-You seem a bit upset, Like.

726
01:12:32,407 --> 01:12:33,840
Of course I'm upset.

727
01:12:34,407 --> 01:12:38,082
-Me old man's poorly.
-Aye, well...

728
01:12:38,247 --> 01:12:40,522
we'll both get
over that, won't we?

729
01:12:44,607 --> 01:12:46,245
Nice bit of brass.

730
01:12:46,927 --> 01:12:48,679
Cheap, yeah?

731
01:12:51,847 --> 01:12:53,405
Ta, son, anyway.

732
01:12:58,207 --> 01:13:00,641
It matters, you know,
that trombone.

733
01:13:01,367 --> 01:13:03,085
-To me, any road.
-Aye.

734
01:13:14,807 --> 01:13:17,640
I'd best be off, eh? Let you
get some shut-eye.

735
01:13:17,807 --> 01:13:18,842
Aye.

736
01:13:19,567 --> 01:13:23,685
Say hello to Sandra and kids for me.
-Yeah, they said, getwell.

737
01:13:24,447 --> 01:13:28,645
l were alongside Arthur Mullins every
day of his working life...

738
01:13:28,807 --> 01:13:31,116
-When they cut him open...
-Dad, don't .

739
01:13:31,287 --> 01:13:33,676
They say when they opened up his
lungs, there were...

740
01:13:33,847 --> 01:13:37,965
nowt in there but coal dust.
Slack. SIack everywhere.

741
01:13:39,247 --> 01:13:41,681
-Took them a week to get t'slab clean.
-Dad...

742
01:13:44,087 --> 01:13:45,679
You'll be all right.

743
01:13:46,087 --> 01:13:48,681
Are you going to tell me lies
all bloody night?

744
01:13:53,607 --> 01:13:54,676
No.

745
01:13:55,927 --> 01:13:58,236
You're right, son.
You're right.

746
01:13:58,607 --> 01:14:02,520
Go on, be off with you. I'll be out
of here in time for t'finaI.

747
01:14:08,607 --> 01:14:10,199
One way or the other.

748
01:14:43,687 --> 01:14:45,678
...different after recent events.

749
01:14:46,087 --> 01:14:49,762
Just thought I’d bring you the
viability study.

750
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:55,364
Ah, right. Yes.

751
01:14:55,887 --> 01:14:57,684
Put it there. Thank you.

752
01:14:59,047 --> 01:15:02,676
So, Frank, you're going down to
Stainly Tuesday and coming back...

753
01:15:04,127 --> 01:15:08,723
-Will you be reading it?
-It would’ve been very valuable...

754
01:15:08,887 --> 01:15:12,277
if the GrimIey miners had decided
to go to a review, but...

755
01:15:13,087 --> 01:15:14,486
as you know, sadly...

756
01:15:14,647 --> 01:15:17,445
You made them an offer they
couldn’t refuse.

757
01:15:18,047 --> 01:15:19,639
None of this is simple.

758
01:15:20,647 --> 01:15:24,526
I’ll tell you some facts as I see
them and you tell me if I’m wrong.

759
01:15:24,687 --> 01:15:26,882
-Miss MuIIins.
-One: I write reports...

760
01:15:27,047 --> 01:15:28,958
that no-one will ever read. They
have to be seen to be written...

761
01:15:29,127 --> 01:15:31,641
but they're not written to be
seen. Two..

762
01:15:31,887 --> 01:15:35,482
Grimley is, was a profitable
pit, says so in here.

763
01:15:36,087 --> 01:15:39,363
Three: the decision to close it
wasn't made today...

764
01:15:39,527 --> 01:15:41,563
-it was made weeks ago.
-Wrong.

765
01:15:43,247 --> 01:15:44,600
2 years ago.

766
01:15:51,687 --> 01:15:55,077
Coal, is history, Miss Mullins.

767
01:16:17,007 --> 01:16:18,998
I’ll catch you later, lads.

768
01:16:35,007 --> 01:16:37,965
Look for years, bloody years, nowt
good's ever happened to me.

769
01:16:38,447 --> 01:16:42,201
Only reason I’d get up was to see if
me Iuck'd changed, but it never has.

770
01:16:42,807 --> 01:16:45,685
It was just beginning to get worse,
with pit closing, losing me job...

771
01:16:45,847 --> 01:16:48,839
and then what happens?
Gloria Mullins...

772
01:16:49,887 --> 01:16:52,685
love of me bloody Life,
walks into practice hall.

773
01:16:52,847 --> 01:16:54,803
Bloody hell, l thought, maybe
life's not so bad.

774
01:16:55,207 --> 01:16:58,199
But is it buggery. She's only
fucking management.

775
01:16:58,367 --> 01:17:00,358
And now that's what you've
been doing.

776
01:17:01,847 --> 01:17:03,997
Yeah, well let's just call that
sleeping with the enemy.

777
01:17:04,167 --> 01:17:07,079
I’m not the enemy.
I’m like you.

778
01:17:09,287 --> 01:17:10,686
Unemployed.

779
01:17:12,927 --> 01:17:14,838
l told them to stuff it.

780
01:17:17,687 --> 01:17:22,681
-You off back down south, then?
-Well, hardly welcome here.

781
01:17:23,047 --> 01:17:26,483
Reckon they all know now,
you were only trying to help.

782
01:17:27,327 --> 01:17:30,683
Thing is if help comes to summat then
you're a hero. lf it comes to nowt...

783
01:17:31,447 --> 01:17:33,085
you're just
another meddler.

784
01:17:34,047 --> 01:17:35,765
And is that what you reckon?

785
01:17:37,967 --> 01:17:40,686
l reckon your heart's in the right
place, but...

786
01:17:41,607 --> 01:17:43,086
you never did owt
to prove it.

787
01:17:47,607 --> 01:17:49,518
I’ll say ta-ra, then.

788
01:18:11,647 --> 01:18:14,002
Summat good'll
happen soon, Andy.

789
01:18:14,927 --> 01:18:16,326
Hope it's at Albert Hall.

790
01:18:16,967 --> 01:18:19,083
Doubt it somehow.
We're not going.

791
01:18:20,247 --> 01:18:22,317
-What?
-They worked it out.

792
01:18:22,487 --> 01:18:24,478
It'd cost three
grand or summat.

793
01:18:26,007 --> 01:18:29,158
No, the band's dead.
It died with everything else.

794
01:18:55,047 --> 01:18:56,196
Harry.

795
01:18:58,287 --> 01:18:59,845
-AII right, Ernie.
-Aye.

796
01:19:06,367 --> 01:19:07,482
Jim.

797
01:19:08,687 --> 01:19:09,802
AII right.

798
01:19:12,887 --> 01:19:15,606
-All right, Phil?
-All right, Andy Lad?

799
01:19:16,567 --> 01:19:19,684
-Owt in?
-There's a machinist wanted.

800
01:19:20,567 --> 01:19:23,320
-You any good at button stitching?
-I’ll take anything.

801
01:19:23,927 --> 01:19:26,077
Well, thank Christ
l found you. Look.

802
01:19:30,607 --> 01:19:31,835
How's your dad?

803
01:19:35,367 --> 01:19:37,244
How'd he take
it about us packing in?

804
01:19:40,247 --> 01:19:42,477
Phil, come on. You've got to
tell him you know.

805
01:19:43,167 --> 01:19:45,840
-l mean, before t'final.
-I’m going to. I'm going to.

806
01:19:47,007 --> 01:19:49,202
-There's a while yet, isn't there?
-Saturday.

807
01:19:57,647 --> 01:19:59,683
I'm afraid
I’ve got some bad news.

808
01:20:00,087 --> 01:20:04,285
Sandra and the kids? l heard about
that. Don't fret, they’ll be back.

809
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:10,603
-Dad...
-Just one day. They won't let me out.

810
01:20:10,767 --> 01:20:12,917
For one sodding day.

811
01:20:17,607 --> 01:20:20,963
-Dad, look...
-Might as well give these to Harry.

812
01:20:22,647 --> 01:20:24,080
Wish him good luck.

813
01:20:25,367 --> 01:20:27,164
l was up all night doing them.

814
01:20:28,007 --> 01:20:28,996
Aye.

815
01:20:31,047 --> 01:20:32,162
Right.

816
01:20:52,847 --> 01:20:54,678
Harvest FestivaI.

817
01:20:55,847 --> 01:20:58,964
To tell you the truth, l don't know
too much about Harvest Festival.

818
01:20:59,847 --> 01:21:02,725
But l do know
a story about God.

819
01:21:04,767 --> 01:21:07,076
So God was creating Man,
all right?

820
01:21:07,367 --> 01:21:09,198
And his little assistant came
up to him...

821
01:21:09,367 --> 01:21:12,359
and he said: "hey, we've got all
these bodies Left...

822
01:21:12,527 --> 01:21:15,280
but we're right out of brains, we're
right out of hearts...

823
01:21:15,447 --> 01:21:17,756
and we're right
out of vocal chords".

824
01:21:17,927 --> 01:21:20,964
And God said "Fuck it.
Sew 'em up anyway.

825
01:21:21,127 --> 01:21:23,880
Smack smiles on their faces and make
them talk out their arses" .

826
01:21:24,047 --> 01:21:28,518
-And lo, God created the Tory party.
-Come on.

827
01:21:28,687 --> 01:21:31,076
-May God forgive you.
-God?

828
01:21:31,567 --> 01:21:34,877
Oh, aye. Now
there's a fella...

829
01:21:36,567 --> 01:21:38,319
I mean, what's
he doing, eh?

830
01:21:39,687 --> 01:21:41,678
He can take
John Lennon...

831
01:21:42,487 --> 01:21:45,206
He can take those three young lads
down at Ainsley Pit.

832
01:21:45,887 --> 01:21:48,196
He's even thinking of taking
my old man.

833
01:21:48,367 --> 01:21:51,279
And Margaret bloody
Thatcher lives?

834
01:21:52,287 --> 01:21:54,847
l mean, what's he
sodding playing at?

835
01:22:02,767 --> 01:22:06,919
You've been great.
My name's Coco the Scab.

836
01:22:07,767 --> 01:22:08,961
Goodnight.

837
01:22:19,447 --> 01:22:22,007
Grandad? What's grandad got
to do with it?

838
01:22:22,167 --> 01:22:25,204
Dad said when people are as poorly
as grandad is...

839
01:22:25,367 --> 01:22:27,676
you've got to do special things
for them.

840
01:22:27,847 --> 01:22:30,998
Shane Love, your dad didn't buy
trombone for your grandad.

841
01:22:31,167 --> 01:22:32,998
He bought it for himself.

842
01:22:33,167 --> 01:22:37,206
He said grandad's gonna die. But at
least Dad getting a trombone...

843
01:22:37,367 --> 01:22:40,006
is gonna make him die happy.
That's what he said.

844
01:22:43,847 --> 01:22:47,123
-Mam?
-What, love?

845
01:22:47,847 --> 01:22:49,997
How the hell
do you die happy?

846
01:22:51,607 --> 01:22:54,246
Oh, we’ll find a way.

847
01:22:55,887 --> 01:22:58,242
l don't Like seeing
Dad sad, Mam.

848
01:23:00,527 --> 01:23:03,837
But I'd sooner see him sad
than not see him at all.

849
01:23:11,087 --> 01:23:13,362
-Help.
-What's that, for fuck's sake?

850
01:23:13,527 --> 01:23:16,041
-HeIp.
-What is it?

851
01:23:18,287 --> 01:23:20,164
Jesus Christ.

852
01:23:39,527 --> 01:23:40,676
Philip?

853
01:23:47,287 --> 01:23:48,322
l mean...

854
01:23:49,127 --> 01:23:51,516
What the bloody hell were you
playing at, lad?

855
01:23:52,167 --> 01:23:54,158
You lost your marbles?

856
01:23:55,247 --> 01:23:57,363
Maybe.
I've lost everything else.

857
01:23:58,047 --> 01:23:59,958
Wife, kids, house...

858
01:24:00,527 --> 01:24:02,677
Job, self-respect...

859
01:24:03,607 --> 01:24:04,722
Hope.

860
01:24:06,287 --> 01:24:08,482
But then, that's
nowt is it, Dad?

861
01:24:10,087 --> 01:24:12,726
Because it's music
that matters.

862
01:24:16,367 --> 01:24:18,403
The band's packed in,
anyway.

863
01:24:26,007 --> 01:24:27,759
Oh, bloody hell, Phil.

864
01:24:31,807 --> 01:24:33,399
Is this man bothering you?

865
01:24:36,207 --> 01:24:38,323
Course he is,
he's me dad.

866
01:24:59,807 --> 01:25:01,286
-Phil?
-Phil Lad?

867
01:25:02,687 --> 01:25:05,076
-Are you all right?
-What are you up to?

868
01:25:05,767 --> 01:25:08,486
Feeding the fucking ducks,
what's it look like?

869
01:25:09,607 --> 01:25:11,120
We heard about, er...

870
01:25:13,807 --> 01:25:16,162
We were on our way to hospital
to see you.

871
01:25:16,367 --> 01:25:17,595
Hey, and your dad.

872
01:25:17,767 --> 01:25:20,679
He'd be dead chuffed
with a visit from you lot.

873
01:25:20,967 --> 01:25:25,165
I tell you, if he were up and about,
we'd all be in intensive bloody care.

874
01:25:25,887 --> 01:25:27,206
Oh, right.
You told him.

875
01:25:28,807 --> 01:25:30,684
Maybe we'll visit him
next week then.

876
01:25:32,007 --> 01:25:33,679
You coming for a
pint, mate?

877
01:25:34,647 --> 01:25:36,842
Drink with scabs, do you?

878
01:25:38,687 --> 01:25:42,316
l voted for t'money,
you know that?

879
01:25:49,687 --> 01:25:53,396
Come on Phil. Stop being a drama
queen. Come and have a wet with us.

880
01:25:53,567 --> 01:25:57,242
Anyway, there's enough bloody
rubbish in this canal already.

881
01:26:06,327 --> 01:26:08,283
He just shook his head.

882
01:26:10,527 --> 01:26:12,836
Can't tell you.
It were like...

883
01:26:14,887 --> 01:26:17,242
lights just went out.

884
01:26:19,047 --> 01:26:22,676
I mean, there he is
coughing up coal...

885
01:26:23,847 --> 01:26:26,441
and all we can do is
break his bloody heart.

886
01:26:28,727 --> 01:26:30,797
Poor sod's got nowt left
to live for.

887
01:26:43,287 --> 01:26:45,517
-Can I get you a drink?
-No, it's all right.

888
01:26:46,367 --> 01:26:49,564
l just wanted to show
you summat.

889
01:26:52,967 --> 01:26:56,357
New bank account.
Grimley Brass Band.

890
01:26:56,567 --> 01:26:58,444
There's three
grand in there.

891
01:26:58,607 --> 01:27:00,563
lf nowt else, it'll get you to
Albert Hall.

892
01:27:01,447 --> 01:27:02,846
This your money?

893
01:27:04,007 --> 01:27:07,124
I don't want it.
It’s dirty money.

894
01:27:07,767 --> 01:27:09,962
I’d prefer it to be brass.

895
01:27:10,447 --> 01:27:12,005
Must be awful, love...

896
01:27:12,167 --> 01:27:14,522
having that much guilt you've got
to buy your way out of it.

897
01:27:18,007 --> 01:27:20,965
Jim, I’m just doing what l was
always doing.

898
01:27:22,367 --> 01:27:27,646
Meddling. Difference is this
time we've not lost before we start.

899
01:27:34,647 --> 01:27:36,683
And you'd want to play
with us, yeah?

900
01:27:38,527 --> 01:27:40,279
I’m not doing
this for me.

901
01:27:41,167 --> 01:27:42,646
I’m doing it for you.

902
01:27:44,327 --> 01:27:45,646
And Danny.

903
01:27:59,527 --> 01:28:01,358
I hope you budgeted for booze.

904
01:28:05,407 --> 01:28:07,238
Danny'd want us
to win, wouldn’t he?

905
01:28:07,407 --> 01:28:09,682
We're not going to win without
a flaming flugel, are we?

906
01:28:16,207 --> 01:28:19,404
Simmo, you haven't flogged it,
have you?

907
01:28:20,007 --> 01:28:22,237
Right, your horn
plays my twenty.

908
01:28:23,367 --> 01:28:24,356
What?

909
01:28:25,847 --> 01:28:27,519
AII right, bastard, thirty.

910
01:28:28,567 --> 01:28:29,636
Okay.

911
01:28:31,087 --> 01:28:33,476
-Yes. He's missed.
-Come on.

912
01:28:33,647 --> 01:28:36,207
-Come on, Andy.
-Come on Andy son. Go on, go on, son.

913
01:28:36,367 --> 01:28:38,198
Take your time.

914
01:28:44,047 --> 01:28:45,526
Bollock brain.

915
01:28:53,287 --> 01:28:55,198
You jammy git.

916
01:28:55,887 --> 01:28:57,286
Well done, Andy.

917
01:28:59,607 --> 01:29:02,121
l said no, Mr. Ormondroyd,
he's asleep.

918
01:29:02,287 --> 01:29:04,517
Most people are at two
in the morning.

919
01:29:05,607 --> 01:29:09,077
Leave a message. He'll get it the
moment he wakes up, all right?

920
01:30:55,687 --> 01:30:58,076
Least it'll give them more
energy won't it?

921
01:31:23,927 --> 01:31:26,999
Brighouse and Rustrick Band,
you have two minutes.

922
01:31:28,287 --> 01:31:30,403
Brighouse and Rustrick,
two minutes.

923
01:31:41,087 --> 01:31:43,999
Grimley Colliery, you
have two minutes.

924
01:31:45,447 --> 01:31:48,120
Grimley Colliery,
two minutes.

925
01:31:48,287 --> 01:31:52,075
By hell, I bet she's glad they've
closed the bugger.

926
01:31:52,247 --> 01:31:54,681
Okay, Lads. Let's do it.

927
01:31:55,047 --> 01:31:58,722
For a thousand redundant miners
and one poorly one.

928
01:31:59,247 --> 01:32:01,078
-Let's do it
-Right.

929
01:32:03,447 --> 01:32:06,723
Nurse, quickly. It's Mr. Ormondroyd.
He's gone.

930
01:35:55,527 --> 01:35:59,076
First prize and Champions of
Great Britain...

931
01:36:00,127 --> 01:36:02,687
Grimley Colliery Band.

932
01:36:28,447 --> 01:36:32,520
This band behind me will tell you
that trophy means more to me than...

933
01:36:32,687 --> 01:36:34,245
owt else in the whole world.

934
01:36:36,007 --> 01:36:39,556
But they'd be wrong. Truth is,
l thought it mattered...

935
01:36:40,007 --> 01:36:42,157
I thought that music mattered...

936
01:36:43,287 --> 01:36:47,075
But does it bollocks. Not compared
to how people matter.

937
01:36:47,647 --> 01:36:50,878
Us winning this trophy won't mean
bugger all to most people.

938
01:36:51,047 --> 01:36:53,959
But us refusing it, like what
we're going to do now...

939
01:36:54,367 --> 01:36:56,005
well then it becomes news,
doesn't it?

940
01:36:58,487 --> 01:36:59,886
You see what I mean.

941
01:37:00,247 --> 01:37:02,681
That way I’ll not just be talking
to myself, will l?

942
01:37:03,007 --> 01:37:05,646
Because over the last ten years,
this bloody government...

943
01:37:05,807 --> 01:37:08,685
has systematically destroyed
an entire industry.

944
01:37:09,007 --> 01:37:11,840
Our industry. And not just our
industry.

945
01:37:12,007 --> 01:37:14,885
Our communities, our homes,
our lives.

946
01:37:15,247 --> 01:37:18,683
AII in the name of progress and
for a few lousy bob.

947
01:37:19,247 --> 01:37:22,319
I’ll tell you something else you
might not know. A fortnight ago...

948
01:37:22,727 --> 01:37:24,479
this band's pit were closed.

949
01:37:24,647 --> 01:37:28,083
Another thousand men Lost their jobs.
And that's not all they lost.

950
01:37:28,407 --> 01:37:31,046
Most of them Lost the will to win
a while ago.

951
01:37:31,327 --> 01:37:33,522
A few of them even lost
the will to fight.

952
01:37:33,687 --> 01:37:34,722
But...

953
01:37:36,127 --> 01:37:40,484
When it comes to losing the will
to live, to breathe...

954
01:37:41,847 --> 01:37:43,075
point is...

955
01:37:44,167 --> 01:37:46,886
if this lot were seals or whales,
you'd be up in bloody arms.

956
01:37:47,047 --> 01:37:50,881
But they're not. They’re just
ordinary, common or garden...

957
01:37:51,047 --> 01:37:54,562
honest, decent human beings.
And not one of them...

958
01:37:55,087 --> 01:37:57,362
with an ounce
of bloody hope Left.

959
01:38:00,767 --> 01:38:03,156
They can knock out
a bloody good tune.

960
01:38:04,047 --> 01:38:06,163
But what the fuck
does that matter?

961
01:38:17,127 --> 01:38:20,005
Now I'm going to take my boys
out onto the town.

962
01:38:21,287 --> 01:38:22,481
Thank you.

963
01:39:04,287 --> 01:39:06,847
-Are you coming back, Sand?
-I dunno.

964
01:39:07,967 --> 01:39:09,685
I’ve got a chair now.

965
01:39:10,567 --> 01:39:12,956
I’ve no frigging house,
but I’ve got a chair.

966
01:39:13,487 --> 01:39:15,842
Well, sort of a chair.

967
01:39:16,127 --> 01:39:18,083
It all sounds very tempting.

968
01:39:22,007 --> 01:39:23,076
All right?

969
01:39:24,367 --> 01:39:25,846
Is that a thank you?

970
01:39:26,527 --> 01:39:28,085
More than that.

971
01:39:28,247 --> 01:39:30,317
I’ve never known him gush
Like that before.

972
01:39:30,487 --> 01:39:34,480
Aye, well I suppose that's what
Yorkshiremen are famous for.

973
01:39:35,047 --> 01:39:37,083
Not showing their feelings.

974
01:39:38,207 --> 01:39:39,196
Aye.

975
01:39:47,167 --> 01:39:49,317
I’m not going
to show mine, either.

976
01:39:57,047 --> 01:39:58,924
All right then,
lads and Iassies.

977
01:39:59,327 --> 01:40:01,887
Land of Hope
and bloody Glory, eh?

978
01:40:02,887 --> 01:40:12,887
