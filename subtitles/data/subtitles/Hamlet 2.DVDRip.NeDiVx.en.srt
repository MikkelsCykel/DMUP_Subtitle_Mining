00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:55,439
Completely. Forever.

319
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:59,440
You can stay till the end of
the term and after that, get out.

320
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:03,683
You can't have a school
without a drama department.

321
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:05,280
Sure, you can.

322
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,692
This is obviously
a practical joke.

323
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:12,663
Look, the county and the school
district are in fiscal crisis.

324
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:15,291
All the arts programs are
on the chopping block.

325
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:19,565
And let's face it, we're not
producing any Oscar-winners here.

326
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:22,764
Tony.

327
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:23,865
What?

328
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:25,432
That would be Tony-winners.

329
00:17:25,677 --> 00:17:27,338
It's the award for theater.

330
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:29,643
Listen up, guy.
I've seen your plays.

331
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,478
This is no great loss.

332
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,191
Well, you're a dirty,
violent beaner!

333
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:44,661
You shouldn't have
hit him like that!

334
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,822
Shut up, you cow.
It wasn't my fault.

335
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:46,922
He made me hit him.

336
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:48,091
That, to you...

337
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:49,225
You are racist, okay?

338
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:50,666
And a terrible person!
Oh, really?

339
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,499
(CLAMORING)

340
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:55,369
Shut up! Shut up!
Shut up! Shut up!

341
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:58,305
Shut up! Shut up!
Shut up! Shut up!

342
00:18:01,146 --> 00:18:03,376
Mr. Marschz?
Are you okay?

343
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:08,583
No, Rand!
I'm not okay!

344
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:17,754
Can you tell me how

345
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:21,355
a little boy

346
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:24,101
from a dairy farm
in Manitoba,

347
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:28,105
who dreams of acting
but can't do it very well,

348
00:18:29,074 --> 00:18:32,066
and could never get
a decent agent,

349
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:36,239
so he moves on,
decides to teach,

350
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:38,613
to pass on his love
of the craft...

351
00:18:40,185 --> 00:18:43,848
Can you tell me how
he deals with all the

352
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:49,550
God-awful crap that's
handed out to him without

353
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,619
wrapping his lips
around a.45

354
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:53,892
and just blowing
his brains out?

355
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,130
Don't do it!

356
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:57,190
(SOBS)

357
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:01,131
(THUDDING)
Is he acting?

358
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:02,571
No, he's not that good.

359
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:04,541
Mr. Marschz!

360
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:09,979
<i>NARRATOR: Dana Marschz's</i>
<i>wavering consciousness</i>

361
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:12,676

Staring into the

367
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:40,074
Drama has
been cancelled.

368
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:44,942
Finally! Now you can go
back to your job at Rite Aid

369
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,144
and start making
some real money.

370
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:50,711
Oh, Dana, I found a great
parking spot right out front

371
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:52,586
and there was still
time on the meter.

(GROANS)

373

They should just ship
you on over to the Gulf,

374
00:19:57,262 --> 00:19:58,456
you know,
let you talk to people.

375
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,192
All the terrorists would
just kill themselves.

376
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:05,669
Well, I, for one, am very
appreciative that Gary drove you here.

377
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:08,205
Why did you
bring that thing?

378
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:12,437
I don't know. I thought maybe I
could work through my grief in song.

379
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,413
(HUMMING)

380
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:22,276
Maybe it's better
that I just...

381
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:23,911
I can't get pregnant.

382
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:26,457
I think we shouldn't
pass on this gene pool.

383
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:28,755
This is for you, baby.

Can you get the... Thanks.

394
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,569
I'm sorry about
my husband.

395
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:15,970
He's not right
in the head.

396
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:17,905
It's okay.
BRIE: It's Marschz, by the way.

397
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:19,034
Marschz?
Yeah.

398
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,408
Marschz.

399
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:21,741
Marschz?

00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:23,041
Marschz.

401
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:24,206
Marschz?

402
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,341
Marschz.

403
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:26,609
Marschz.

404
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:27,845
I don't care.

405
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:31,482
Excuse me,
I'm sorry to be so forward,

406
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:36,084
but you look a lot like my favorite
actress of all time, Elisabeth Shue.

407
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:38,061
Yeah. I am her.

408
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:40,096
But you really
look like her.

409
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:42,899
Well, that's
because I am her.

410
00:21:43,568 --> 00:21:47,231
Oh, my God!
I knew it in my heart-soul.

411
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:50,537
(MUFFLED) Oh, my God!
I'm freaking out!

412
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:51,769
I'm freaking out.

413
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:54,368
You, you were wonderful
in <i>Leaving Las Vegas...</i>

414
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:55,572
Oh, thank you.

415
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:57,842
...and so fabulously funny in
<i>Adventures in Babysitting,</i>

416
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:00,544
not forgetting <i>Cocktail</i>
with Tom Cruise.

417
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:02,382
What is he like?
He seems totally great.

418
00:22:02,454 --> 00:22:03,751
What are you
doing in Tucson?

419
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,585
Oh, my God!
I'm freaking out!

420
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:08,887
I'm actually
a nurse now.

421
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,418
I just, you know, got kind of
sick of the business, you know?

422
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,465
Sick of all
the horrible people,

423
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:16,590
and it's all about being
a fucking celebrity now.

424
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:19,569
Anyway, there's a real
shortage of nurses out there,

425
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:22,607
and I like
taking care of people.

426
00:22:23,275 --> 00:22:25,004
Oh, my God!
I didn't hear anything you just said

427
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:26,567
because I'm too excited.

428
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:29,341
Would you come and speak
with my drama class?

429
00:22:29,414 --> 00:22:31,507
They would just
lose their minds.

430
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:34,450
No. They wouldn't even
know who I am, anyway.

431
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:35,577
They would.

432
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:38,983
All right. I'll come.

433
00:22:39,057 --> 00:22:42,720
But, I'm gonna talk about all the
insecurity and the self-loathing,

434
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:44,387
the rejection...

435
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:45,589
Perfect!

436
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:47,197
So, what's Nick Cage
really like?

437
00:22:47,265 --> 00:22:50,166
I mean, were you
just paralyzed with awe?

438
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:52,935
I have to go
back to work.

439
00:22:53,071 --> 00:22:54,436
Elisabeth Shue.

440
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:58,499
I feel so connected
to you. Yes, I do.

441
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:01,470
And I thank you for
giving me back my smile.

442
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:03,104
You're welcome.

443
00:23:03,648 --> 00:23:06,208
Shoo! Shoo, Shue!

444
00:23:06,284 --> 00:23:07,581
Oh, God!

(WHISTLING)

448
00:23:20,031 --> 00:23:21,658
Okay, gang.

449
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,963
This is the amount
we need to save drama.

450
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:31,941
6K, a.k.a. $6,000.
How do we get it?

451
00:23:33,378 --> 00:23:35,141
Piff?
Bake sale.

452
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:39,149
Not enough dough,
pun intended.

453
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:42,049
Yo. We could
knock over a 7-Eleven.

454
00:23:42,487 --> 00:23:44,512
Nice thought,

455
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:47,023
but 7-Elevens are not as
vulnerable as they used to be.

456
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,491
Don't ask me
how I know that.

457
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,619
I saw it on
the Discovery Channel.

458

I've got a little
something-something.

Let's hear it.

Toasters. Man, you know,
we just move that skeet.

461
00:23:56,968 --> 00:23:59,061
You know, 10 grands.

462
00:23:59,137 --> 00:24:01,537
(SIGHS) Hell,
we could do that.

463
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:02,971
Hey, dumbass!

464
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:06,403
"Toaster" is
street for "gun."

465
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:08,207
"Toaster" is
street for "gun"?

466
00:24:08,346 --> 00:24:10,109
What a colorful expression!

467
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:13,543
There he goes!
The little kangaroo rat!

468
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:17,886
Hey, Noah Sapperstein.

469
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:19,388
Oh, hi!

470
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:20,982
Happy? Huh?

471
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:24,119
Happy you finally
succeeded in taking me down?

00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:26,562
No. I think it's
terrible what's happened

to arts education

Everything is
out of control.

476
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:35,866
You want to save drama, but you've
produced nothing worth saving.

477
00:24:35,941 --> 00:24:37,101
You know, it's like...

478
00:24:37,175 --> 00:24:39,268
It's like my father
got reincarnated

479
00:24:39,344 --> 00:24:41,778
into the body of a freaking
little drama critic.

480
00:24:41,847 --> 00:24:44,315
Look, all I'm saying is,

481
00:24:44,382 --> 00:24:47,146
you need to inspire everyone
to come to your rescue.

482
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:50,953
You know, I was
thinking of working

483
00:24:51,022 --> 00:24:52,512
on a musical version
of <i>The Lake House,</i>

484
00:24:52,591 --> 00:24:56,391
you know the wonderful
Sandra Bullock, Keanu Reeves...

485
00:24:56,461 --> 00:24:58,554
Play with space and time.

486
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:00,359
No?
No.

487
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,026
There is one other thing.

488
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:04,328
It's a piece I've
been working on.

489
00:25:04,402 --> 00:25:09,465
I have the first act and reams
of notes in my inspiration box.

490
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:12,567
It's called <i>Hamlet 2.</i>

491
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:16,207
A sequel to <i>Hamlet</i>
by Shakespeare?

492
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:19,444
Yes. Yes. Do you think
it's a bad idea?

493
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:21,886
Not necessarily, no.

494
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,653
Sometimes an idea could be so bad,
it starts to turn good again.

495
00:25:25,724 --> 00:25:30,354
But... And so, what about
funding for drama next trimester?

496
00:25:30,428 --> 00:25:31,827
Forget about
the money right now.

497
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:34,923
Put on a play, and make it
the best you've ever done.

498
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,834
Use that as a way of drawing
attention to the funding issue.

499
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:41,433
What if it sucks?

500
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,902
Isn't that a question every
artist must ask himself?

501
00:25:44,976 --> 00:25:49,037
(GASPS) Yes! I am
an artist, aren't I?

502
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:53,448
Thank you. You've given me the
kick in the pants I needed, kid.

503
00:25:53,518 --> 00:25:55,383
Okay, well, I need
to go to recess now.

504
00:25:55,453 --> 00:25:57,580
You're very busy.
I understand.

505
00:26:14,806 --> 00:26:18,572
Oh, my God!
Writing is so hard.

506
00:26:35,126 --> 00:26:37,890
What is your
fucking problem, man?

507
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,089

What is? My original work
that's gonna save drama.

The thing I've been working on
for the last 47 billion hours.

00:28:04,449 --> 00:28:05,746
Oh, is that what
you were doing?

It's stupid to compare.

Okay, I'd like to start
by saying two things.

663
00:35:06,237 --> 00:35:10,469
First of all, acid
is a very strong drug,

664
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:18,515
and B, where are my
pants and underwear?

665
00:35:24,722 --> 00:35:26,656
Excuse me, Mr. Marschz.

666
00:35:27,191 --> 00:35:30,354
We need to discuss something
about the latest draft.

667
00:35:30,428 --> 00:35:34,865
The role of Laertes, my part,
you've turned him into a gay.

668
00:35:34,932 --> 00:35:37,901
He's not gay.
He's bi-curious.

669
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:41,029
And the role has also
been reduced significantly.

670
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:43,232
Rand, theater is
a living thing.

671
00:35:43,374 --> 00:35:45,501
Octavio's performance
the other day,

672
00:35:45,576 --> 00:35:48,067
combined with my wife's
intense desire to get pregnant,

673
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,614
not to mention the acid,

674
00:35:50,681 --> 00:35:52,171

some bold steps

675
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:53,717
in looking at my
relationship with my father.

676
00:35:53,784 --> 00:35:56,309
That meant reducing
Laertes' role.

677
00:35:57,054 --> 00:36:00,217
And the gay thing, I just thought
you'd be more comfortable...

678
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:01,758
What? What?

679
00:36:02,627 --> 00:36:05,425

with my sexuality!

Because he caused me

to become an actor,

I can totally tone that down.

using a time machine

to stop Gertrude from
drinking the poison,

from drowning.

out of the tragedy.

I just wondered why in <i>Hamlet 1</i>
everybody has to die.

770
00:40:24,321 --> 00:40:28,189
It's such a downer! I mean, if Hamlet
had had just a little bit of therapy,

771
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:30,227
he could have turned
everything around.

772

a second chance!

773

make up his own mind.

00:41:15,706 --> 00:41:17,139
Let's just say that
when you get to the scene

791
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:18,402
where Gertrude
gives Hamlet a hand job,

792
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:19,704
you'll sense my drift.

793
00:41:20,244 --> 00:41:21,302
Did you just
say "hand job"?

794
00:41:21,378 --> 00:41:22,709
Yes, I did.

795
00:41:23,113 --> 00:41:25,581
He thinks he's going to
save drama with this play.

796
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:29,983
Mr. Rocker, if you care about
decency and if you love this country,

797
00:41:30,554 --> 00:41:33,887
you will stop Dana Marschz.
Take him down.

798
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:35,755
Then take him from behind!

799

00:41:46,303 --> 00:41:47,702
I'm here for her.
I'm here for her.

803
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:55,507
Apologies, the Snackatorium is no
longer available, regrettably, because

804
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:59,345
the ladies who make macaroni and
cheese are getting very territorial.

805
00:41:59,416 --> 00:42:06,345
So without further ado, I'd like
to introduce you to Elisabeth Shue.

806
00:42:06,457 --> 00:42:08,254
Elisabeth Shue,
get up here.

807
00:42:08,626 --> 00:42:10,457
All right.

Thank you so
much for having me.

811

God, I really have a tough time
speaking in front of people.

812
00:42:20,804 --> 00:42:22,533
I get a little nervous.

813
00:42:22,606 --> 00:42:23,766
I'm way more
nervous than you.

814
00:42:23,841 --> 00:42:26,776
I'm like... My brain
is like mush.

815
00:42:27,845 --> 00:42:30,177
(IN SQUEAKY VOICE)
Elisabeth Shue, is she real?

816
00:42:30,581 --> 00:42:32,515
Somebody pinch my ass.

817
00:42:32,917 --> 00:42:35,317
It's inappropriate.
I'm sorry. It's just...

818
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:36,910
Should we just
take questions?

819
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:38,612
That'd be great.

820
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:42,158
Okay, class, questions
for Ms. Shue.

821
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,155
Someone other than Epiphany.

822
00:42:45,629 --> 00:42:47,722
Okay, not all at once.

823
00:42:48,632 --> 00:42:52,762
You guys, come on, I asked
you to prepare a few questions.

824
00:42:52,836 --> 00:42:54,201
You know, I'm
a reasonable guy.

825
00:42:54,271 --> 00:42:55,863

Can we not share
this space in peace?

828
00:43:07,051 --> 00:43:08,313
Epiphany?

829
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:12,347
Hi. I just want to say I
think your make-up is pretty.

830
00:43:13,157 --> 00:43:14,590
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

831
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:16,185
It is nice.

832
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:19,423
What about Mr.
Alpha Male up there?

833
00:43:19,496 --> 00:43:20,827
Got a question
for Ms. Shue?

834
00:43:21,665 --> 00:43:22,996
Yeah.

835

Oh, come on!

even Google her?

I've heard
the word "shit" before.

much have to swim in it.

What do you miss
about acting?

847
00:44:00,504 --> 00:44:02,165
You know what I really
miss about acting?

848
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:05,333
I miss kissing.
In love scenes.

849
00:44:05,409 --> 00:44:08,936
I had so much fun making out
with all those cute actors.

850
00:44:09,013 --> 00:44:11,447
I would love to
stay and hear this.

851
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:14,814
SHUE: Yeah, I think if I had
one complaint about nursing,

852
00:44:14,885 --> 00:44:18,719
it would be that you don't get
to make out with your patients.

853
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:26,827
It's fricking exciting having
Elisabeth Shue in class.

854
00:44:26,897 --> 00:44:28,865
Because of its
unwholesome content,

855
00:44:28,932 --> 00:44:32,265
the school cannot allow the
exhibition of <i>Hamlet 2.</i>

856

Where did you get that?

857
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:35,767
Entirely beside the point.

858
00:44:36,106 --> 00:44:37,266
Did Rand give it to you?

859
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:40,310
Nudity and pornography are not
permitted on the school premises.

860
00:44:40,377 --> 00:44:42,937
There's no nudity
or pornography!

861

a modernist dance.

What?
