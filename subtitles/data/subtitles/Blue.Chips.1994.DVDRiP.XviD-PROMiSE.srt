00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,015
You gotta bust him out.

2
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:24,690
All right. come on. now.

3
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,905
How bad can it get?

4
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:46,240
Just how goddamn bad can it get?

5
00:00:46,746 --> 00:00:50,682
This is by far the worst team
that has ever sat in this locker room.

6
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:54,745
You son of a bitches.
you don't deserve a locker room.

7
00:00:54,954 --> 00:00:58,219
You don't deserve a locker room.
the way you're playing this year.

8
00:00:58,425 --> 00:00:59,983
You should be playing
without uniforms.

9
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:02,718
You should be playing
in your jockstraps.

10
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:04,897
Goddamn it!

11
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:09,727
Every time we get ready to play.
l just wanna throw up.

12
00:01:09,936 --> 00:01:12,666
l'm goddamn sick
of watching you guys play.

13
00:01:12,872 --> 00:01:16,467
There's not one of you. not one of you.
that's learned how to win.

14
00:01:16,676 --> 00:01:22,342
We got hammered the last four games.
and it stops right now!

15
00:01:24,684 --> 00:01:26,242
lf you keep playing
the way you're playing.

16
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:28,819
we're gonna get our ass
beat again tonight.

17
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:32,049
l'm so depressed
l don't even wanna talk about it.

18
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:35,617
l'm through fighting.
you sons of bitches!

19
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:40,161
You're the dumbest team
l ever coached.

20
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:45,267
You guys think of something.

21
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:55,574
All right. guys. The guards--

22
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:59,582
Honest to Christ. l just wanna go home
and cry when l watch us play.

23
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,777
Don't you boys understand?

24
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:05,287
Don't you know how bad
l wanna see this team play?

25
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:09,519
l wanna see this team play
so fucking bad. l can taste it.

26
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:11,219
Honest to Christ!

27
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:14,025
You boys. the only joy
l have right now

28
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:17,829
is l only have to watch you guys
play two more games.

29
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:20,398
Goddamn it!

30
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:35,347
All right. guys. let's start thinking
about the game.

31
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:38,115
Let's start thinking about
what we're gonna do out there.

32
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:44,128
l can't tell you how sick l am
of basketball right now.

33
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,991
l never thought l'd see the day

34
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:49,066
when Western basketball
is in the state it is right now.

35
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:54,973
lf l never see another game in my life.
that's just fine by me.

36
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:02,239
Dwayne. you can get through
college half-assed.

37
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:06,577
Richard. you can get
through life half-assed.

38
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:10,586
But l'll guarantee you boys one thing.
Sure as hell. l'll guarantee you this:

39
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:13,691
You cannot win half-assed!

40
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:17,090
l wanna win this ball game!
Let's go!

41
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:22,183
Yeah!

42
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:47,644
And welcome to the Dolphin Dome
for tonight's game

43
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:51,756
between the Texas Western Cowboys
and the Western University Dolphins.

44
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,483
Coach Pete Bell for Western
is on the hot seat.

45
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:57,356
He's in danger of having
his first losing season ever.

46
00:04:57,563 --> 00:05:01,294
but a victory tonight would ensure
a winning season for Coach Pete Bell.

47
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:04,937
lt's gonna be tough. though. because
Texas Western is tournament bound.

48
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,935
They are well-coached
by Rick Pitino.

49
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,974
They've got a dynamic backcourt duo
with Sam Crawford and Rex Walters.

50
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:15,238
and they should get up-front court help
from Chris Mills and George Lynch.

51
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:17,882
lt should be a great game.
First-half action coming up.

52
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:24,723
D-up. man. Play him up.
Hands up. Hack.

53
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:26,414
Deny those leads!

54
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:28,560
Dwayne. pick up the ball!

55
00:05:29,228 --> 00:05:30,661
Hands up. baby.

56
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:32,731
He's going to his left.

57
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:34,866
Get in front of him.

58
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:36,834
Two shots.

59
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:39,266
Screen across.

60
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:41,167
Pick him up. pick him up!

61
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:43,467
- Play yourself. Mitch.
- Help on the ball.

62
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,541
- Mitch. use your feet!
- Come on. Ed. come on.

63
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:47,144
- That's a foul.
- Personal foul...

64
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,939
Oh. for chrissakes!

65
00:05:49,148 --> 00:05:51,082
What the hell's the matter with you?

66
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:54,742
Goddamn it. we're not moving the ball.
Just standing around. for chrissake.

67
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:56,387
Let's go to the four-man motion.

68
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:57,988
lf they go to their one man.

69
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,716
don't worry about the big guy.
he's not gonna handle it.

70
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:05,762
Don't trap four and five.
Only trap one. two and three.

71
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:11,531
Take him to the hoop!

72
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,508
What the hell is this?

73
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,336
Great call. You're the best.

74
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:21,513
What in the hell is this? What.
have you got blinders on tonight?

75
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:23,272
l mean. you haven't
made a call all night.

76
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:25,616
Look out.

77
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:27,418
That's why you're a good official.

78
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:32,388
Now look. now look.
Up and under. George. Up and under.

79
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:35,419
Move. George. move.
Move. George.

80
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:39,428
Nice move. We got it.
Stay with it. Stay with it!

81
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,759
What the hell is that kind of a call?

82
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:45,335
- Explain that to me.
- You've got your last warning.

83
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:47,597
You sit down.
You've got your last warning.

84
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,741
- l'll ring you up.
- Horseshit!

85
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:53,209
Get back. get back. get back!
Full speed.

86
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:58,910
Son of a bitch.

87
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,214
Three.

88
00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:05,289
Now. now. now. now.

89
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,321
There it is.

90
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:10,925
Good job. Rebound. let's go!

91
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:15,466
Go slow. Stay in it. Stay in it!

92
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,463
They're getting tired.
They're breaking down right now.

93
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:21,765
They are not in great shape.

94
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:25,266
Come on. fill the lanes. Let's go.

95
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:27,610
- George! There it is.
- Did you see that?

96
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:29,441
That's it. take away the middle.
Dunk it.

97
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:31,443
He fouled! Foul!

98
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:34,713
Rebound it. Rebound it. yes!

99
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:37,589
Rotate.

100
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,257
Watch. he's coming!

101
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:43,760
- They're fouling me every time!
- l don't give a shit!

102
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,089
The tempo is ours.

103
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:48,664
Go strong. Rick.
He got killed.

104
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:51,530
Plug up the middle.
Plug it up.

105
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:04,512
Nigel. goddamn it.
get over on his left foot!

106
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:06,878
Ray Charles could've made
a better call. for chrissake.

107
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:08,178
Call that in the box!

108
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:10,787
You're standing over.
and you know he didn't touch him!

109
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,550
- Goddamn it!
- l'm here! He's over there!

110
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:17,493
l didn't call it.

111
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:19,358
l swear to God...

112
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,993
That's the third fucking time
you did that!

113
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:30,300
- What do you want me to do?
- You son of a bitch!

114
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:33,570
You son of a bitch!

115
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,274
You get out of here!
Get out of here!

116
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:39,278
l got it! l got it!

117
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:41,919
Am l wrong? Was l wrong or what?

118
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:45,648
- He had a different angle than you.
- Bullshit! Am l wrong or what?

119
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:48,088
Piss it.

120
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:52,990
Coach Bell is ejected from the arena.

121
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:11,575
Yo. coach.

122
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:14,150
lt's your friendly athletic director.

123
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:15,650
Thought l'd better stop by

124
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:18,688
and officially comment
on your behavior out there tonight.

125
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:21,359
Well. goddamn it. Vic.
lf l have to get on these kids

126
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,121
as hard as l did tonight
just to get them to play good.

127
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,321
l don't know if l can take
another goddamn game.

128
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:27,794
Coach. relax. will you?

129
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,560
lt's the end of a long season.
You know how it works.

130
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,965
You'll feel better about it
in the morning.

131
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:36,435
There's no goddamn way l'm gonna
feel better about it in the morning.

132
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:39,770
You know l'm gonna feel worse.
l'm just gonna get angrier and angrier.

133
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:42,504
Take all day.
You'll feel better by tomorrow night.

134
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:45,343
You know. if we keep losing.
you're gonna be out of a job.

135
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:47,212
God. tell me something l don't know.

136
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:54,584
My congratulations to Texas Western
and their wonderful coaching staff.

137
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:56,921
They played a terrific game.

138
00:09:57,863 --> 00:10:01,959
That's about all l have to say on that.
Any questions. stupid or otherwise?

139
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:03,601
- All right. Allan?
- Yeah. coach.

140
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:07,432
We'd like to hear your side
of the basketball-kicking incident.

141
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:11,233
The basketball-kicking incident.
All right. next question.

142
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,742
Allan. you used up your question.
That was stupid.

143
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,106
Ed?

144
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:16,474
Do you think it's fair to say

145
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:18,775
that your inability to get
the program back on track

146
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:22,250
is strictly related to recruiting problems
that started four years ago

147
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,218
after the alleged
point-shaving incident?

148
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:27,449
How long you gonna
keep this bullshit up. Ed?

149
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,220
You know goddamn well
there was no such incident.

150
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:33,660
There was an alleged incident
which you invented.

151
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:36,926
in the same way that if l assert
that you sleep with sheep.

152
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:40,128
then it is alleged
that you sleep with sheep!

153
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:42,364
- That's out of line. coach.
- What do you mean?

154
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:44,270
lf you can't take the heat.
get out of my face.

155
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,707
Goddamn it. you know nothing
like that happened here.

156
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:48,504
Listen. l didn't say that it happened.

157
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:52,480
l merely asked you if you thought
that the allegations hurt recruiting.

158
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:53,879
l didn't say it happened.

159
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:56,554
lf this is the level of questions
l'm gonna get here tonight.

160
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:58,383
this press conference is over.

161
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:02,254
He's a beauty. huh?

162
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,547
Did you see the game?

163
00:11:28,754 --> 00:11:31,450
No rebounding.
You got beat on the boards.

164
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:34,191
Yeah. no rebounding.

165
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,753
We're not aggressive enough.

166
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:38,930
Actually. l thought the kids
played their hearts out.

167
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:41,964
Yeah. they did.
They did the best they could.

168
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:43,692
Don't put the game tapes
in the VCR.

169
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:46,929
- We'll just watch this tonight.
- Not tonight.

170
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:51,604
All right.

171
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:54,336
You should've pressured
the guards more.

172
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:57,815
Yeah. we should've pressured
their guards.

173
00:11:58,017 --> 00:11:59,382
but we're not quick enough.

174
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:00,950
That's the good stuff. coach.

175
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:04,919
You're gonna drink like a fish.
there's some cheap stuff in the kitchen.

176
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:07,992
Now you're trying to slow me down?

177
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:09,718
Always.

178
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:13,789
- How was your day?
- My day?

179
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:17,864
l had 20 first-graders
making valentines.

180
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:23,239
Yeah. hearts are tough to cut out.

181
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:25,433
Easier than pumpkins.

182
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:29,614
Yeah. well...

183
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:38,456
Honey. you okay?

184
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:41,316
Yeah.

185
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:43,358
You sure?

186
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:48,689
Oh. that damn Ed Axe.
He'll be in on the Daily News rider.

187
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:54,472
He brought up
the alleged incident again.

188
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:56,573
That's bullshit.

189
00:12:57,877 --> 00:13:00,937
l'm looking at my first losing season.
l just can't handle it.

190
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:03,342
Don't you think it's a bit much
for a 50-year-old man

191
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:05,847
to be kicking basketballs
up into the stands?

192
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:08,884
- l hope it didn't hit anybody.
- No.

193
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:14,917
l just-- l don't do well
with losing. do l?

194
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,719
You've won two
national championships.

195
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:17,987
Go on.

196
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:20,097
This is two more
than most coaches dream of.

197
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:23,359
You've won eight conference titles.
l don't call this losing.

198
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:24,968
You've got great kids.

199
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:27,901
The cleanest program in America.
They all graduate.

200
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:31,008
You make a lot of money doing exactly
what it is what you wanna do.

201
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,041
- l could go on and on.
- No. do. Do.

202
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:35,372
l'm not going to.
because l'll get angry.

203
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:37,981
Do you like it when l'm angry
because it turns you on?

204
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:39,651
- You think it's sexy?
- l do.

205
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:41,114
- Do l look sexy?
- Yes. you do.

206
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,811
Suppose you wanna do
a little one-on-one?

207
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:45,354
Can l stay here tonight?

208
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,253
No.

209
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:50,519
- Oh. come on. What do you say?
- No. Come on. let's go.

210
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:57,696
Come on. come on. Let's go.

211
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:12,150
Why are we divorced. again?

212
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,943
Because you're impossible
to live with.

213
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:16,519
- Besides that.
- Good night.

214
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:03,896
Texas Western 7 4,
Western University 59.

215
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:06,503
The Dolphins out of it, now at .500

216
00:15:06,705 --> 00:15:09,697
and in danger of their first
losing season under Pete Bell.

217
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:13,777
ln closing, it is time to tell Coach Petey
Bell of the Western University Dolphins

218
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:15,378
to take a hike.

219
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,913
He has clearly lost the touch
he once had.

220
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:19,880
This year's team
is the least disciplined,

221
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:22,952
the least fundamentally sound squad
we've seen in years,

222
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:26,716
and his sideline antics are becoming
boorish and embarrassing.

223
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:30,828
To the alumni, to the chancellor,
to the athletic director Vic Roker,

224
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:34,591
it is time to tell Coach Petey Bell
to take a hike.

225
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,927
Move it. move it. move it!

226
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:41,103
Keep your spacing.
Keep your spacing there. Phil.

227
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:44,770
Widen out.
Where's the goddamn spacing?

228
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,205
When l'm coming down here
and l'm setting this screen.

229
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:50,814
give it here.
Lock him off. Lock him off!

230
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:52,677
Don't get lazy on us. Come on. Rick!

231
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:55,012
Set it. Roll. Tony!

232
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:58,951
Tony. when you get on this screen.
you've gotta get this foot locked here.

233
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:02,321
lf your footwork is here and this
is open. you're trying to rotate.

234
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:04,996
he's got all the room in the world.
But if you lock here...

235
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:06,892
Now try to go this way. Steve.

236
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:10,728
See? But if you got this foot back.
here. set the screen like this.

237
00:16:10,936 --> 00:16:13,131
now l'm trying to rotate.
l can't get there.

238
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:16,240
But if l set this foot in here
and l rotate. l'm here.

239
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,306
Tony. son. it's footwork.

240
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,273
All right. let's go. Let's go.

241
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,940
Got that?

242
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:25,173
Spin and roll.
Hit and spin.

243
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:27,215
Move right to the basket.

244
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,614
Free throws!

245
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:36,388
- Tony! Tony. come here.
- What's up. coach?

246
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:38,392
You've been looking down lately.
What's going on?

247
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:41,259
- How you doing in your classes?
- Well. actually. l'm flunking a class.

248
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:43,162
- You're flunking a class? What class?
- TV.

249
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:45,394
TV? How can you be flunking TV?

250
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:48,596
Coach. that's a tough class.
You don't just watch the tube.

251
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,570
How's it going with that little girl?

252
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:53,506
Oh. man. she's cool. She's not
pregnant after all. lt's all right.

253
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:55,680
Now. remember.
you've got a responsibility there.

254
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:57,280
so you take care of her. all right?

255
00:16:57,483 --> 00:16:59,280
- All right. go on back in.
- All right. coach.

256
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:00,884
Mel. come here.

257
00:17:01,086 --> 00:17:03,919
Get a tutor for Tony for TV. all right?

258
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:06,114
Freddie. take Tony.

259
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:09,021
Take him to a pharmacy
and get him some prophylactics.

260
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:12,857
Coach! Come on. baby.
what's wrong? Coach.

261
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:20,602
When other teams used to come in
and see these banners.

262
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:23,138
it scared them to death.

263
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:27,740
All these banners were worth. what.
eight points anyway.

264
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:32,017
But everything changes. huh?

265
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:33,809
Everything changes. coach.

266
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:37,284
Yeah. there's very little in life
that man's got a control over.

267
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:38,649
Things just happen.

268
00:17:38,857 --> 00:17:41,451
so when you got a chance to
make a statement. you gotta do it.

269
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,355
We haven't been
making a statement.

270
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:46,053
When we were winning conference
titles and going to the Final Four.

271
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:47,755
we were making a statement.

272
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:50,332
The kids are working
as hard as they can. you know.

273
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:52,367
They just don't have the talent.

274
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,562
Yeah. well. l can't beat anybody
with banners.

275
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:57,264
l need players. l need horses.

276
00:17:57,776 --> 00:18:00,768
You got horses.
What you need are thoroughbreds.

277
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:05,012
Well. everybody in the country is
buying these kids out of high school.

278
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:10,883
giving them cars and money
under the table. God knows what.

279
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,782
Don't you ever miss?

280
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:18,989
That's the idea of the game.
put the ball in the hole.

281
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:23,657
There's two reasons l'm incapable
of cheating. Wanna hear them?

282
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:25,268
Tell me.

283
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:29,903
One. if l break the rules...

284
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:34,240
...and l get caught.
l'll get kicked out of coaching.

285
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,979
And what's the second reason?

286
00:18:38,016 --> 00:18:39,984
l might not get caught.

287
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:43,216
Miss the goddamn ball once.
will you?

288
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:45,652
Jesus Christ.

289
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:50,986
You can't even miss left-handed.

290
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,400
All right. does anybody know
what this is?

291
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:01,903
- A heart.
- That's what it is.

292
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:04,041
lt's a goddamn heart.
That's what it is.

293
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:07,178
Boy. l'm beginning to think there's
some intelligence in this room.

294
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:09,370
Now. if you guys show me
you got one of these.

295
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:11,446
we're gonna win this game tonight.

296
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,880
- Tony. you got one of these?
- Yes. sir.

297
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:16,111
Tony. do you know
what we're trying to do on defense.

298
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,949
- how it triggers our transition game?
- Yes. sir.

299
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:22,457
Do you think the entire team
understands what we're trying to do?

300
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:25,357
Good. because l'm holding you
personally responsible

301
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:27,759
for this whole team
understanding this philosophy.

302
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:30,491
- Do you accept that responsibility?
- Yes. sir.

303
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,331
Phil. get in for Dwayne.

304
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,166
Byron. come here.

305
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:41,711
Nice pass. Tony.

306
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,444
Play it all the way through. let's go.

307
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:50,781
Good steal. Mitch. Good steal.

308
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,721
Post him up. Richie.
Post him up. baby. Post him up.

309
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:57,691
Yeah. take him. take him.

310
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,260
Nigel. get back! Full speed!

311
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:04,196
Pick up the open man. Richard!
Oh. shit!

312
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,698
- Protect the ball!
- Shit!

313
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:12,139
Get your hands up. Man. come on.

314
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:20,884
Hey. coach. you better
get a new day job.

315
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,052
Have you given it any thought

316
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:28,385
you may be 20 minutes away
from your first losing season?

317
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:31,722
These kids have played their heart out.
l'm not answering that bullshit.

318
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:34,455
l don't mean to ruffle feathers.
Good luck in the second half.

319
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:37,066
- Pick up your man.
- Move out on the ball!

320
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,035
Move out on the ball!

321
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:48,504
Pick up on the point guard. make
the point guard have to work in there.

322
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:50,181
Whoever's got the point guard.

323
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:53,749
pick him up high and keep him
going to his left in there.

324
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:57,846
Set her up. Tony. Nice move.

325
00:20:58,056 --> 00:21:00,115
Take it. Take it. Tony. Take it.

326
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:01,883
Yeah. yeah. got you!

327
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:04,358
All right!

328
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:06,357
That's what we need.

329
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:21,204
- Better get them rebounds.
- Do it!

330
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:23,779
Too many offensive rebounds.
Let's go.

331
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:26,450
Come on. guys. come on.

332
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:28,987
Move the ball.
Lay it out. lay it out.

333
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:34,222
- Get back! Full speed!
- Somebody gonna block out Rogers?

334
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:36,724
Somebody gonna block out
Rogers tonight?

335
00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:40,125
His tenth dunk tonight. guys. let's go.

336
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,933
Get around on him. Ricky!
Full speed!

337
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,934
Stop the ball!

338
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:52,635
Come on. now. don't quit on me!

339
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:21,437
You call me. now. All right.

340
00:22:24,142 --> 00:22:27,839
Guys. Guys. listen up. Listen up.

341
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:31,713
l just wanna thank you all again
for a hell of a season.

342
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:34,283
l want you to remember one thing.
goddamn it.

343
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:36,920
When we leave this locker room.
we're not losers.

344
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:40,148
We're winners. okay?

345
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:41,921
We're losers.

346
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:44,652
We're an absolutely
mediocre basketball team.

347
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:46,694
Yeah. but these kids
are a great bunch of guys.

348
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:48,525
l know they're a great bunch of guys.

349
00:22:48,734 --> 00:22:50,258
but not one of them
can play basketball.

350
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:53,029
Except Tony. and he's flunking TV.

351
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:56,507
What the hell happened?
How did we sink so low so fast?

352
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:59,575
Kids are going east to play.
They want the television exposure.

353
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:01,006
Well. that's part of it. Freddie.

354
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,773
but goddamn it. l think what it is
is we've been sitting on our butt.

355
00:23:03,982 --> 00:23:05,643
We haven't been going out there.

356
00:23:05,851 --> 00:23:07,876
We expected the kids to come here
out of tradition.

357
00:23:08,086 --> 00:23:09,610
That's not happening anymore.

358
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:11,254
What the hell happened
to the Jones kid?

359
00:23:11,456 --> 00:23:13,481
- He was in our back yard.
- Cedric Jones. l remember.

360
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:15,990
- l had six meetings with his family.
- What happened?

361
00:23:16,194 --> 00:23:18,253
We lost him to the East.
to a big bag of dough.

362
00:23:18,463 --> 00:23:21,455
l mean. come on. guys. maybe it's time
we should start anteing up.

363
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:24,931
No. goddamn it. We ain't doing that.
We ain't opening that Pandora's box.

364
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:26,126
Ask Freddie.

365
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:28,568
l don't recommend
under-the-table recruiting.

366
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:30,435
lt's a personal hell you're in for.

367
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:32,872
Let's get these guys. Goddamn it.
let's get on the phones.

368
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,069
and let's stay here all night
if we got to.

369
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:39,877
All right. tell us about Cornelius Brown.
6-foot-7 power forward.

370
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,609
By way of Pluto.
he's a major headcase.

371
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,583
He can stick it from anywhere.
but. l mean.

372
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:45,313
l think he's committed
to Western Nebraska

373
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:48,049
with a phony job from
an alumnus congressman.

374
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,057
All right. Willy Hutchinson.

375
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:53,254
We heard this guy was on the verge
of signing a letter of intent to Eastern.

376
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:55,558
And his old man's been seen driving
a Mercedes-Benz

377
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:57,758
- since the day he signed the letter.
- Lot of rumors.

378
00:23:57,969 --> 00:23:59,664
There's a lot of rumors.
Do yourselves a favor.

379
00:23:59,871 --> 00:24:02,738
Chop off the bottom eight names
on your list. They are irrelevant.

380
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:04,408
The top two guys
are the ones you want.

381
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:08,340
Okay. that's Butch McRae.

382
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:10,378
- Chicago?
- Yeah. he's from St. Joseph's.

383
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:14,074
And Ricky. Ricky Roe.
We got him there.

384
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:16,186
- 6'8'' power forward.
- Butch and Ricky show.

385
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:19,949
You get those two guys.
you are in the Final Four next year.

386
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:40,434
What do you think. guys?
He looks pretty good. huh. Tark?

387
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:43,267
He's a great player. but l don't think
we can get him in academically.

388
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:46,239
- You don't think so?
- l don't think so.

389
00:25:49,447 --> 00:25:51,779
- What do you think. Jim?
- l don't think he can play for you.

390
00:25:51,983 --> 00:25:53,541
- You don't?
- Too many bad shots.

391
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:55,720
- Can he play for you?
- Well. maybe.

392
00:25:55,921 --> 00:25:57,252
Yeah. that's what l figured.

393
00:25:57,455 --> 00:26:00,185
- His mother's a pain in the ass.
- Yeah. his mother's a pain in the ass.

394
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:03,361
What has he got?
He's got 2 7 points now?

395
00:26:08,633 --> 00:26:09,998
You guys looking
for a Rhodes scholar?

396
00:26:10,201 --> 00:26:12,362
Yeah. a Rhodes scholar
who can dunk.

397
00:26:14,673 --> 00:26:17,073
- Will you tell Father Dawkins l'm here?
- l sure will.

398
00:26:17,275 --> 00:26:19,869
And we can send
these ugly guys home.

399
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:22,979
Father Dawkins. Coach Pete is here.

400
00:26:31,856 --> 00:26:33,118
There's blood in the water.

401
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:36,021
Must be a point guard on the block
around here somewhere.

402
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:38,024
All right. gentlemen.
what are my bids?

403
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:39,924
Give me $50
for this strapping young boy.

404
00:26:40,131 --> 00:26:42,861
Seventeen and getting bigger
every day.

405
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:44,467
Dig deep in your pockets. gentlemen.

406
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:47,263
They say he's a potential
all-American.

407
00:26:47,472 --> 00:26:50,270
And he can read and write.
The boy can actually read and write.

408
00:26:50,475 --> 00:26:52,966
He got 1 250 on his SATs.

409
00:26:53,178 --> 00:26:56,670
Ain't no problem. either. His name ain't
Abdul Ahmad X or nothing like that.

410
00:26:56,881 --> 00:26:58,974
The boy's actual name is Butch.

411
00:26:59,184 --> 00:27:01,118
With a name like that.
he ought to have freckles.

412
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:05,688
Now. what are my bids. gentlemen?
Dig deep in your pockets. Dig deep!

413
00:27:09,327 --> 00:27:12,728
Hey. Pete. step inside.

414
00:27:15,533 --> 00:27:16,966
We're in trouble.

415
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:18,658
- l think we're in trouble.
- Yeah.

416
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:20,269
How's Tony?

417
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,736
Tony's fine. Tony's fine.

418
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:25,466
- ls he going to class?
- Yeah. he's going to class.

419
00:27:25,677 --> 00:27:27,872
He's trying. lt's a struggle. though.

420
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:30,240
l love him. but if he flunks.
he deserves it.

421
00:27:30,448 --> 00:27:31,676
Oh. l'm not gonna let him flunk.

422
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:33,612
You're here because
of Butch McRae. aren't you?

423
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:35,445
Yeah. Yeah.

424
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:38,521
- He's something. huh?
- Yeah. he's the best we've had.

425
00:27:38,723 --> 00:27:40,884
And he's smart too.
He's got his head screwed on straight.

426
00:27:41,092 --> 00:27:42,286
Doesn't make any mistakes.

427
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:45,258
- His father's not around. right?
- No.

428
00:27:45,463 --> 00:27:48,057
l hear his mother is a piece of work.

429
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,794
ls a powerful piece of work.

430
00:27:51,536 --> 00:27:54,869
l hear she wants money.
She wants money just to talk.

431
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:57,769
She only charges the schools
she doesn't like.

432
00:27:57,976 --> 00:27:59,637
Well. did she like us?

433
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:01,744
She likes your science department
a whole lot better

434
00:28:01,946 --> 00:28:03,538
than she likes
your basketball program.

435
00:28:03,748 --> 00:28:06,182
l don't blame her.
They have a better record lately.

436
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:08,818
l can get her to waive the grand.

437
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:13,689
but if you try to bullshit Lavada McRae.
she will eat you alive.

438
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,405
- Coach Bell.
- Mrs. McRae.

439
00:28:33,611 --> 00:28:35,806
Lavada McRae.
You have any trouble finding us?

440
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:38,106
No. No problem whatsoever.

441
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:40,617
- Come on in.
- All right.

442
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:44,414
- This is my son. Butch.
- Good to meet you. Butch.

443
00:28:44,622 --> 00:28:47,216
- Thanks a lot. A pleasure to meet you.
- Wonderful game.

444
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:50,124
This is my mother. Miss Dorothy.

445
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:52,592
Oh. how do you do?
lt's good to meet you.

446
00:28:52,797 --> 00:28:55,527
- My daughter Qiana.
- Hello. Qiana. how are you?

447
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:58,635
My baby. Britney. This is Alicia.

448
00:28:58,837 --> 00:29:00,930
- All right. Britney.
- That's Alicia.

449
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:05,075
Alicia. good to meet you.
Britney. it's good to meet you.

450
00:29:05,276 --> 00:29:06,538
lt's nice to meet you too.

451
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:09,578
Mrs. McRae. your children
are well-mannered.

452
00:29:09,781 --> 00:29:11,976
That's good Catholic upbringing.

453
00:29:12,183 --> 00:29:14,242
You know what. l'm Catholic too.

454
00:29:14,452 --> 00:29:15,714
l'm not.

455
00:29:16,721 --> 00:29:18,382
l just send them all to St. Joseph's

456
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,615
because the priest and nuns
don't take no shit.

457
00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:23,319
Butch. is there anything
you wanna ask Mr. Bell?

458
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:25,689
l don't know. Mom. L.A.?

459
00:29:25,897 --> 00:29:28,127
- L.A. is a long ways from here.
- Yes. it is.

460
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:29,561
That's part of going to school.

461
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:32,362
Getting away from home.
meeting new friends.

462
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:35,539
We'd love you to come out
to Western and visit the campus.

463
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:38,174
l don't know. coach. l'll think about it.

464
00:29:38,376 --> 00:29:41,004
l'm kind of scared
to take the college courses.

465
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:43,174
That's normal. Butch.

466
00:29:43,381 --> 00:29:46,111
l mean. Dr. George Howe.
the head of our science department.

467
00:29:46,317 --> 00:29:48,512
he's world-famous.
He loves basketball.

468
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,314
Are you implying that classes
are rigged for athletes?

469
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:57,250
Mrs. McRae. my players
take real classes.

470
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,327
My players do graduate.

471
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:02,591
l think the thing that l really wanted
to ask you is. will l start next year?

472
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:05,463
Well. you'll get the opportunity
to start. Butch.

473
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:09,367
l mean. our whole offense is gonna be
geared around the point guard.

474
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:12,304
And that's the position
we'd love you to come in and play.

475
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:16,241
l've been doing some thinking
about this. and...

476
00:30:18,016 --> 00:30:19,176
Let me show you.

477
00:30:19,384 --> 00:30:22,182
Mrs. McRae. do you mind if l do this?
Kids. come on over here.

478
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:24,412
l got something.
You guys are gonna have a lot of fun.

479
00:30:24,622 --> 00:30:26,317
Stand right here for a second.

480
00:30:26,524 --> 00:30:29,789
Can l use this lamp?
ls this lamp--? Yeah.

481
00:30:30,028 --> 00:30:32,656
Oh. Grandma. can you
come on over and help us?

482
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:36,095
Yeah. come on over here.
l want you to guard this chair.

483
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:37,996
Now. put your arms out
like you're guarding.

484
00:30:38,203 --> 00:30:41,172
Qiana. l want you to guard
this lamp right here.

485
00:30:41,372 --> 00:30:42,839
Come on. this will be fun.

486
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:44,508
Now. you're the off guard.

487
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:48,145
This pillow. this is the ball.
Here you go. Butch.

488
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:51,247
Okay. you pass it to your mom
over there. That's it.

489
00:30:51,449 --> 00:30:53,474
Now. you pass it him. Mrs. McRae.
Pass to Butch.

490
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:55,016
Pass the ball over here.

491
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,949
Butch. you cut around right there.

492
00:30:57,155 --> 00:31:00,147
Throw it in to your brother.
Lay in it there.

493
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:02,656
- Beautiful. Beautiful.
- Yes.

494
00:31:04,495 --> 00:31:07,487
- l have a family to consider.
- Oh. of course.

495
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:11,229
And if Butch chooses
to become a Dolphin.

496
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:14,564
l plan on moving to a new
and better job.

497
00:31:14,772 --> 00:31:16,171
l have references.

498
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:17,807
Well. there are rules.

499
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:20,739
l would also like a house
with a lawn.

500
00:31:20,945 --> 00:31:22,742
My children have never had a lawn.

501
00:31:22,947 --> 00:31:27,384
Mrs. McRae. do you know how
the NCSA regulations work?

502
00:31:27,585 --> 00:31:32,147
Mr. Bell. l don't know a great deal
about basketball. but l do know this:

503
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:36,952
A foul is not a foul
unless the referee blows his whistle.

504
00:31:37,495 --> 00:31:40,328
Mrs. McRae. do you really want
your son to start out life

505
00:31:40,531 --> 00:31:42,829
by learning how to bend
and break the rules?

506
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:47,470
What's he gonna be when he grows up.
and then he's out in the world?

507
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:51,768
Now he's responsible
and the leader of other young men.

508
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:53,500
What's he gonna become?

509
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:56,872
A millionaire?

510
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:59,803
A white farm boy with a basketball?

511
00:33:00,378 --> 00:33:03,677
Oh. l don't know. son. l don't think
you're ever gonna make it.

512
00:33:03,881 --> 00:33:06,475
Can't run. can't jump.
bad back. pathetic.

513
00:33:06,684 --> 00:33:08,481
- How's it going. Pete?
- l'm doing good. Larry.

514
00:33:08,686 --> 00:33:11,780
l was just driving around. l was in
the neighborhood. l thought l'd stop by.

515
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,356
Yeah. you and every other coach
in the country.

516
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:17,460
Well. you know. all those years l spoke
for free at your basketball camp.

517
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,129
those stock tips l gave you?

518
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,922
Cut the B.S.. Petey.
What do you want?

519
00:33:21,132 --> 00:33:22,622
- Ricky Roe. You know him?
- Yeah.

520
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:24,859
- Will you call him for me?
- When?

521
00:33:25,069 --> 00:33:27,003
- Whenever you got time.
- Let's go.

522
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:36,146
Hello.

523
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:38,008
- Hi.
- Welcome to French Lick. Mr. Bell.

524
00:33:38,216 --> 00:33:41,413
Thank you. thank you very much.
How are you. Mr. Roe?

525
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:43,314
- Fine.
- Fine. You can call me Pete.

526
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:45,751
l'd just as soon keep it businesslike.
if you don't mind.

527
00:33:45,957 --> 00:33:48,118
- My wife. Lucille.
- Hello. Lucille. how are you?

528
00:33:48,326 --> 00:33:49,520
- My son. Ricky.
- Yes. hi. Ricky.

529
00:33:49,727 --> 00:33:51,251
- What's up. coach?
- Come on in.

530
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:56,832
Dear Lord. we thank you
for the blessings you've given to us.

531
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,024
We thank you for this food.

532
00:33:58,236 --> 00:34:00,101
please bless it to the nourishment
of our bodies

533
00:34:00,304 --> 00:34:03,273
and our bodies to thy service.
These things we ask in Christ's name.

534
00:34:03,474 --> 00:34:05,908
- amen.
- Amen.

535
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:09,341
Well. this looks wonderful.
Oh. meat loaf. great.

536
00:34:10,281 --> 00:34:13,045
So. what direction do you see your
college studies taking you. Ricky?

537
00:34:13,251 --> 00:34:15,481
Actually. l haven't given it
much thought.

538
00:34:15,686 --> 00:34:19,053
Well. there's no reason you have
to decide now. you have plenty of time.

539
00:34:19,257 --> 00:34:20,849
He'd like to take over
the farm someday.

540
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,583
- l would?
- Yes. you would.

541
00:34:23,494 --> 00:34:26,224
The truth is. l haven't even decided
if l wanna go to college at all.

542
00:34:27,832 --> 00:34:30,232
Well. what are you interested in?

543
00:34:30,435 --> 00:34:32,596
You really wanna know what
l'm interested in. coach?

544
00:34:32,804 --> 00:34:34,499
Girls.

545
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:37,239
lt's girls and just playing basketball.
you know.

546
00:34:37,442 --> 00:34:39,137
- Girls and hoops.
- Those are good interests.

547
00:34:39,343 --> 00:34:40,708
- Yeah. yeah. yeah.
- You know?

548
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:42,777
But. you know. Ricky.
let me tell you something.

549
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:45,380
You know. you got an opportunity
to use your basketball skills

550
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:48,848
to get into school.
and you gotta take that opportunity.

551
00:34:49,053 --> 00:34:51,487
l mean. now. don't get me wrong.
we got a lot of girls at Western.

552
00:34:51,689 --> 00:34:54,920
- Hell. we got a million of them.
- They'd like what l can do out there.

553
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:56,957
l think l could go out
to California and just.

554
00:34:57,161 --> 00:34:58,924
you know. show them
what l got out there.

555
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:01,462
Yeah. well. take this opportunity.
get your education.

556
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:03,657
you know. even if you don't
come to Western.

557
00:35:03,868 --> 00:35:07,065
You know. the girls are gonna wait.
They'll be there.

558
00:35:11,509 --> 00:35:15,138
- Boy can shoot.
- Yes. he can.

559
00:35:15,346 --> 00:35:17,814
But does he wanna go to college?

560
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:20,542
Oh. yeah.

561
00:35:20,751 --> 00:35:24,187
And l still have
some influence over that.

562
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:28,423
You know. it's a very funny thing.

563
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:30,594
A lot of coaches have been by here.

564
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:33,195
asking me what l needed.

565
00:35:33,397 --> 00:35:37,265
l told them l need a new tractor.
Look at that thing over there.

566
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:41,529
Old Farmall.
44 years old this month.

567
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:44,603
Hard work making it
with a small farm anymore.

568
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:47,778
All them big combines.

569
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:50,209
- Tractor. huh?
- Yeah.

570
00:35:50,414 --> 00:35:52,348
Now. l didn't ask for nothing.

571
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:55,951
l just keep getting offered farm
equipment by this school and that.

572
00:35:56,954 --> 00:36:00,981
Whether it's bending the rules or not
don't bother me none.

573
00:36:01,192 --> 00:36:02,853
because they ain't my rules.

574
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:07,019
So. what you're saying is.
somebody's gonna give you a tractor?

575
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:10,200
That's what l'm saying.

576
00:36:10,401 --> 00:36:15,566
Well. l want my boy. if he was
to decide to go on to college.

577
00:36:15,773 --> 00:36:19,038
to be with a coach
that's gonna watch over him.

578
00:36:19,243 --> 00:36:22,337
Well. maybe it's time
to let him go a little.

579
00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:24,515
Maybe.

580
00:36:24,715 --> 00:36:29,846
But in that case. l'd like him
to be with someone who's a...

581
00:36:30,054 --> 00:36:32,852
Well. a churchgoing type.

582
00:36:33,624 --> 00:36:39,494
Well. for whatever it's worth. Mr. Roe.
l was raised a Baptist.

583
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:43,398
First Baptist or Southern Baptist?

584
00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:47,427
First Baptist. of course.

585
00:36:48,906 --> 00:36:52,467
Well. thank the good Lord. Pete.

586
00:36:52,677 --> 00:36:56,340
We don't think too much
of Southern Baptists around here.

587
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:59,141
if you catch my drift.

588
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:14,797
And now a special treat.

589
00:37:14,999 --> 00:37:18,457
Riding with our own Ricky Roe
is the grand marshal of the parade.

590
00:37:18,669 --> 00:37:21,570
the man who went from the
Blackhawk black. white and gold

591
00:37:21,772 --> 00:37:24,036
to the silver-green
of the Boston Celtics.

592
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:26,836
French Lick's very own Larry Bird.

593
00:37:27,044 --> 00:37:29,444
Let's give them all
a big French Lick welcome.

594
00:37:58,643 --> 00:37:59,769
Welcome home. coach.

595
00:37:59,977 --> 00:38:02,605
- Slick. What are you doing here?
- Waiting for you. Pete.

596
00:38:02,813 --> 00:38:03,939
- Me?
- Yeah.

597
00:38:04,148 --> 00:38:05,638
l got a hot one for you. baby.
come here.

598
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:07,818
And you're telling me nobody's
ever heard of this guy?

599
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:09,509
Well. l've been
watching him for a while.

600
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,280
Hell. the kid never even played ball
in high school. He went to Army.

601
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:15,152
played in Europe.
He grew eight inches in two years.

602
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:16,917
He got too big for Army regulation.

603
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,993
And he played a little JC ball
in New Mexico.

604
00:38:19,196 --> 00:38:22,427
But when he finally stopped growing.
he got all his coordination back.

605
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:26,160
He showed up at a gym recently
with some pros. kicked butt bigtime.

606
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:28,065
Why are you bringing him to me?

607
00:38:28,272 --> 00:38:30,934
Even though this kid is still a project
with a lot of rough edges.

608
00:38:31,342 --> 00:38:33,037
l know your program's
so screwed up right now.

609
00:38:33,244 --> 00:38:35,109
my boy will move
in the starting lineup.

610
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:36,746
You wanna take a plane ride
to meet him?

611
00:38:36,947 --> 00:38:38,380
- Plane ride?
- Yeah. see if l'm right?

612
00:38:38,582 --> 00:38:39,981
- Where is he at?
- Algiers.

613
00:38:40,351 --> 00:38:41,511
Algiers?

614
00:39:07,878 --> 00:39:09,539
- For chrissake!
- Oh. come on.

615
00:39:09,747 --> 00:39:11,442
This guy better pan out.
or l tell you.

616
00:39:11,649 --> 00:39:15,415
you're never gonna come to any more
games at Western. goddamn it.

617
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:08,404
Did you see that?
He went:

618
00:40:12,676 --> 00:40:16,077
He ain't just big. Pete.
he's quick. he's got big hands.

619
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,248
Watch how he moves
away from the ball.

620
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:21,384
He's totally raw.
He's never been coached.

621
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:26,249
Jesus Christ.

622
00:40:27,391 --> 00:40:29,052
Oh. man.

623
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:32,496
l'm not gonna bullshit you. Pete.
He ain't no brain surgeon. all right?

624
00:40:32,696 --> 00:40:36,097
Took the SAT recently.
scored 520 out of a possible 1 600.

625
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:39,963
520? You get 400 for just
spelling your name correctly.

626
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:42,332
That's it. He messed up
on his name.

627
00:40:48,846 --> 00:40:50,177
Slick. what up. man?

628
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:52,406
Coach Bell. Neon Bodeaux.

629
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:54,641
- Hey. bro. how you doing?
- Fine.

630
00:40:54,852 --> 00:40:57,013
Neon. did you ever think about
going to college?

631
00:40:57,221 --> 00:40:58,483
l've thought about it a few times.

632
00:40:58,689 --> 00:41:01,590
All right. there's a thing
called Proposition 48.

633
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:04,022
which says that if your grades
aren't up to par.

634
00:41:04,228 --> 00:41:05,388
you can take the SATs.

635
00:41:05,596 --> 00:41:08,360
and if you score 700 or more.
you can get into college.

636
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:10,259
Would you be willing
to take the test again?

637
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:12,459
l don't know. man.
Them tests are culturally biased.

638
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:14,501
Well. everything is culturally biased
in the end.

639
00:41:14,705 --> 00:41:16,696
l'm just trying to get you in college.

640
00:41:16,907 --> 00:41:20,172
lf l couldn't play basketball. would you
be trying to get me in college?

641
00:41:22,213 --> 00:41:24,875
- No.
- At least you're honest.

642
00:41:25,082 --> 00:41:26,811
Fill my soul with the Holy Ghost

643
00:41:27,017 --> 00:41:29,008
Please fill my soul
With your precious Holy Ghost

644
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,619
What kind of church is this?

645
00:41:30,955 --> 00:41:32,388
Assemblies of God.

646
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:35,650
Pentecostal? Hell. l grew up
in the Pentecostal Church.

647
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:39,660
Please fill my soul
With your precious Holy Ghost

648
00:41:39,864 --> 00:41:42,332
Oh, yeah

649
00:41:42,533 --> 00:41:46,435
Receive that saving power
Receive that saving power

650
00:41:46,737 --> 00:41:49,205
l promise you boys this.
if you come to Western University

651
00:41:49,406 --> 00:41:52,273
you will enjoy the finest
athletic facilities in the country.

652
00:41:52,476 --> 00:41:56,640
We got 45.000 students.
60 percent of them are girls. Ricky.

653
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:58,712
Sports are a way of life here.

654
00:41:58,916 --> 00:42:02,613
Football team's been in the top ten
consistently for the last 20 years.

655
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:05,550
Baseball team is in the
College World Series this year.

656
00:42:05,756 --> 00:42:07,223
Track-and-field team...

657
00:42:07,424 --> 00:42:10,882
Track-and-field team. eight gold
medals in the last Summer Olympics.

658
00:42:11,095 --> 00:42:14,690
And look at this weather. l mean.
look at this. No more cold weather.

659
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:18,699
Beats the hell out of those cold. harsh
winter nights in Chicago and lndiana.

660
00:42:18,903 --> 00:42:19,995
l mean. look at this.

661
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:21,637
There it is. gentlemen.

662
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:24,399
Students used to wait all night long
just to get tickets.

663
00:42:24,608 --> 00:42:27,202
- Be back in a minute.
- We're on the verge of that again.

664
00:42:27,411 --> 00:42:30,608
Have you gentlemen ever heard
1 5.000 people cheering for you?

665
00:42:30,814 --> 00:42:34,272
- Of course. all the time. All the time.
- Twenty. About 20 every game.

666
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:52,399
Ladies and gentlemen,

667
00:42:52,603 --> 00:42:55,401
the starting lineup for the
Western University Dolphins:

668
00:42:57,775 --> 00:43:01,609

675
00:43:29,073 --> 00:43:31,098
Hey. that's great. coach.
but l'm not 6'9''.

676
00:43:31,308 --> 00:43:32,866
l'm no 6'1 1 '' either.

677
00:43:33,077 --> 00:43:34,840
- l am 7'4''.
- You are 7'4''.

678
00:43:35,045 --> 00:43:38,481
Now. listen to me. guys. that's how tall
you're gonna be when you play here.

679
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:42,650
When l first came to this land

680
00:43:42,853 --> 00:43:46,812
l was not a wealthy man

681
00:43:47,024 --> 00:43:49,584
So l built myself a shack

682
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:51,522
Jenny. Jenny.

683
00:43:51,729 --> 00:43:54,197
l did what l could

684
00:43:54,698 --> 00:43:55,665
Neon.

685
00:43:55,866 --> 00:43:58,892
And l called my shack
Break my back

686
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:01,230
That's Jenny right there.
She's the greatest tutor.

687
00:44:01,438 --> 00:44:03,406
But the land was sweet and good

688
00:44:03,607 --> 00:44:06,974
l did what l could

689
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:11,673
Great. that was so good.
We'll do it again in a minute.

690
00:44:11,882 --> 00:44:15,443
and you can play for a while...l Spy.
Good. Really. really good. Great.

691
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:17,644
- Jenny. l want you to meet someone.
- No way.

692
00:44:17,855 --> 00:44:19,652
- No way.
- No. this is Neon Bodeaux.

693
00:44:19,857 --> 00:44:21,518
- Neon. nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

694
00:44:21,725 --> 00:44:24,819
l am very sorry. Neon. but l haven't
tutored college students in years.

695
00:44:25,029 --> 00:44:27,395
not since Tony. That's what
you're about to ask for. isn't it?

696
00:44:27,598 --> 00:44:29,395
She's the greatest tutor
in the conference.

697
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:32,728
The '84 team. she got
the whole front line into school.

698
00:44:32,936 --> 00:44:35,427
And l kept them in school for
four years. but that was then. Neon.

699
00:44:35,639 --> 00:44:41,339
Jenny. this is special.
This is unusual.

700
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:44,307
Can he play with the kids?

701
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:47,040
- Of course. Neon. go play with kids.
- Yeah. go on.

702
00:44:47,251 --> 00:44:49,014
- You sure?
- Yes.

703
00:44:50,721 --> 00:44:54,179
Look at him. what do you think?
l've never seen anything like this guy.

704
00:44:54,391 --> 00:44:56,154
- This guy is phenomenal.
- This is outrageous.

705
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,351
What happened to Butch McRae
and Ricky Roe?

706
00:44:58,562 --> 00:44:59,620
Well. l'm working on them.

707
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:01,320
l never even heard
of Neon Bodreaux.

708
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:04,990
Bodeaux. Neon Bodeaux.
Nobody has. He's a project. like Tony.

709
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:07,966
Look. you got Tony admitted.
and look how wonderful he's doing.

710
00:45:08,172 --> 00:45:09,867
l thought Tony was flunking TV.

711
00:45:10,074 --> 00:45:13,202
Well. he's having a little trouble.
but that's a tough class.

712
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:15,970
You know. you don't
just watch the tube.

713
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:20,907
Neon. please try and not step
on the children.

714
00:45:21,452 --> 00:45:22,749
Okay. all right.

715
00:45:24,354 --> 00:45:26,982
Jenny. come here.
Come here. come here. Now. listen.

716
00:45:27,191 --> 00:45:31,753
Listen. l found this kid in the sticks
in New Orleans. okay?

717
00:45:31,962 --> 00:45:33,486
He's had a tragic life.

718
00:45:33,697 --> 00:45:36,632
l mean. his father was a gar fisherman.
He had a boating accident.

719
00:45:36,834 --> 00:45:39,769
he got eaten by an alligator.
l know that sounds funny.

720
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:41,665
but he doesn't have
any relatives or a sister.

721
00:45:41,872 --> 00:45:43,499
and nobody knows
what happened to his mother.

722
00:45:43,707 --> 00:45:44,799
Oh. cut the crap. Pete.

723
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:49,438
- Can he rebound?
- He's the next Olajuwon.

724
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,443
What are his SATs?

725
00:45:51,648 --> 00:45:52,740
- Six...
- Pete.

726
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:54,440
- 520.
- Oh. God.

727
00:45:54,651 --> 00:45:56,312
Well. those tests
are culturally biased.

728
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,420
Oh. now you're a sociologist?

729
00:45:58,622 --> 00:46:02,581
Oh. just this once. Jenny. You know.
l'll never ask you again. please?

730
00:46:02,793 --> 00:46:05,762
He is incredible.
He can rebound. huh?

731
00:46:05,963 --> 00:46:09,057
Look at him. He owns the paint.

732
00:46:09,466 --> 00:46:10,433
- For you?
- Yeah.

733
00:46:10,634 --> 00:46:12,226
No.

734
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:16,672
For Neon. maybe.

735
00:46:16,874 --> 00:46:20,970
For Tony. yes.

736
00:46:21,178 --> 00:46:24,079
Maybe l'd like to see Tony have a little
help on the boards his senior year.

737
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:25,942
- That's just--
- Don't you kiss me.

738
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:27,845
- All right. l'm sorry.
- This is not for you.

739
00:46:28,051 --> 00:46:29,245
lt's for the ball club.

740
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:31,478
- Now. get out of here.
- Okay.

741
00:46:31,688 --> 00:46:32,848
- Take him with you.
- What?

742
00:46:33,056 --> 00:46:36,253
- Take him with you. Thank you.
- Oh. yeah.

743
00:46:40,264 --> 00:46:41,788
Happy. where the hell
have you been?

744
00:46:41,999 --> 00:46:44,763
- You know. here. there. everywhere.
- There's a table ready and waiting.

745
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:48,802
Yeah. just one second. l got somebody
over here l want you to meet. Come on.

746
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:51,539
Pete.

747
00:46:52,509 --> 00:46:54,101
l want you to meet
two big Dolphin fans.

748
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:56,506
This is Wendy. this is Karen.
This is Coach Bell.

749
00:46:56,713 --> 00:46:58,943
- How are you? Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

750
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:02,050
Let me tell you something. that was a
great job you did on that sportswriter.

751
00:47:02,252 --> 00:47:05,187
They're all a bunch of jerks.
you know.

752
00:47:07,591 --> 00:47:11,687
Hey. why don't you go over to the table.
l'll be right with you. okay?

753
00:47:13,797 --> 00:47:15,924
Let me ask you something. Pete.

754
00:47:16,133 --> 00:47:18,897
Why do you hate me so much?

755
00:47:20,804 --> 00:47:23,102
Because l think you
and the 50.000 alumni

756
00:47:23,307 --> 00:47:26,003
you represent are a bunch
of obnoxious slobs.

757
00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:27,541
Oh. you're pissed off. that's good.

758
00:47:27,744 --> 00:47:30,338
You're a better coach
when you're pissed off.

759
00:47:31,415 --> 00:47:33,007
Good night.

760
00:47:35,786 --> 00:47:38,220
Going home. coach?

761
00:47:40,257 --> 00:47:42,623
Why are you walking away
from me. coach?

762
00:47:42,826 --> 00:47:45,158
You never walk away from anything
in your life. l know you.

763
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:47,387
- You don't know shit.
- l know everything.

764
00:47:47,598 --> 00:47:49,930
l know what Butch McRae's
mother wants.

765
00:47:50,133 --> 00:47:51,828
l know you got a kid named
Neon Bodeaux

766
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:54,003
being tutored by your ex-wife.

767
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:56,502
l know what Ricky Roe
is gonna want.

768
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:59,540
l know the amount of money that it's
gonna take to buy out your contract

769
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:02,837
is the same that it'll take to get Butch
and Ricky to sign letters of intent.

770
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:04,377
We don't buy athletes.

771
00:48:04,581 --> 00:48:06,549
Let me tell you something.
in case you don't know.

772
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:10,186
Our football team ranked in the
top ten for the last eight years

773
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:13,618
has got a linebacker.
a tailback. an offensive tackle.

774
00:48:13,824 --> 00:48:16,622
two safeties and a quarterback
all recruited by friends of the program.

775
00:48:16,827 --> 00:48:19,352
- l don't like football.
- They're all graduating this year.

776
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:22,293
We're clean.
My money is untraceable.

777
00:48:22,499 --> 00:48:25,696
lt's been washed. scrubbed.
laundered within an inch of its life.

778
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:29,634
You got a future in politics. asshole.
Why don't you run for office.

779
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:33,202
These athletes generate millions
of dollars for the university.

780
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:35,139
What do they get? Nothing!

781
00:48:35,345 --> 00:48:37,973
What do you get?
You get a multiyear contract.

782
00:48:38,181 --> 00:48:41,617
You get a six-figure shoe deal so your
team can be a walking billboard.

783
00:48:41,818 --> 00:48:43,217
and that is all legal.

784
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:46,753
And then you get another
six figures for that lousy TV show.

785
00:48:46,957 --> 00:48:48,390
Get out of my face.

786
00:48:51,962 --> 00:48:54,089
We owe them this money.

787
00:48:57,501 --> 00:48:58,661
We owe it to them!

788
00:48:59,703 --> 00:49:04,868
Okay. Neon. tell me the country located
immediately north of the United States.

789
00:49:05,075 --> 00:49:06,337
Spain.

790
00:49:07,577 --> 00:49:10,341
Tell me the country located
immediately south of the United States.

791
00:49:12,683 --> 00:49:15,311
- Canada.
- All right. l'll give you $50

792
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:18,682
if you will tell me the country located
immediately south of the United States.

793
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:20,015
- Fifty dollars?
- Fifty.

794
00:49:20,824 --> 00:49:23,725
Mexico. followed by Guatemala.
Belize. Honduras.

795
00:49:23,927 --> 00:49:27,556
Nicaragua. El Salvador
and Costa Rica. Where's my $50?

796
00:49:27,764 --> 00:49:30,597
- Oh. l was lying.
- Crazy.

797
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:32,996
Yeah. l was married to Pete.
What's your excuse?

798
00:49:33,403 --> 00:49:36,133
You start off insulting me with these
third-grade geography questions.

799
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:38,934
You think you're liberal.
but you're nothing but a racist.

800
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:42,941
- Why'd you score 520 on your SATs?
- Because l wanted to.

801
00:49:44,181 --> 00:49:45,876
That makes a lot of sense. Neon.

802
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:47,673
When l was young.
my 'hood was so dangerous

803
00:49:47,884 --> 00:49:50,717
l joined the Army. and we invaded
the Persian Gulf for a vacation.

804
00:49:50,921 --> 00:49:52,115
l make my own sense.

805
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:54,623
So why are we here?

806
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:57,419
We're here because maybe l wanna
go to college and maybe l don't.

807
00:49:57,627 --> 00:50:00,926
l won't know until l get in and find out
how much bullshit it really is.

808
00:50:01,131 --> 00:50:04,362
Okay. l'll make you a bet for real.
l bet you $1 00

809
00:50:04,568 --> 00:50:07,628
that you can't score 700 points
on your SATs.

810
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:12,036
l'll score 700 in my sleep.
For $1 00. l'll score 800.

811
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:15,971
Be right back.

812
00:50:22,052 --> 00:50:23,349
- Hello.
- How's he doing?

813
00:50:23,553 --> 00:50:25,020
- He's interesting.
- Good.

814
00:50:25,222 --> 00:50:26,951
Yeah.

815
00:50:28,058 --> 00:50:31,050
- How's it going. Neon?
- Your old lady's tough. bro.

816
00:50:31,261 --> 00:50:34,253
- My ex-old lady's tough.
- Now l see why you left the bitch.

817
00:50:34,464 --> 00:50:37,297
He doesn't need tutoring.
he needs a good kick in the butt.

818
00:50:37,501 --> 00:50:38,559
There's a test in two weeks.

819
00:50:38,769 --> 00:50:40,532
- He should sign up and take it.
- Great.

820
00:50:40,737 --> 00:50:42,534
Get your money ready.
l'm gonna win that bet.

821
00:50:43,774 --> 00:50:45,708
- Come on. baby. let's play.
- Play him hard.

822
00:50:45,909 --> 00:50:49,868
l got him. l got him.
Yo. man. why don't y'all help out?

823
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:52,913
Jesus. what a mismatch.

824
00:50:56,653 --> 00:51:00,817
- Listen. let's take some pride. y'all.
- l got him. l got him. l got him.

825
00:51:01,458 --> 00:51:03,358
This is like streetball. man.

826
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:05,084
Hey. come on. play some defense.

827
00:51:05,295 --> 00:51:07,126
Let's see what these guys have got.

828
00:51:09,699 --> 00:51:11,929
Come on. make him work.

829
00:51:21,945 --> 00:51:23,776
All right. there's Calbert Cheaney.

830
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:25,242
- Right.
- All right?

831
00:51:25,449 --> 00:51:28,850
Okay. so we don't even want him
to get the ball. right?

832
00:51:29,052 --> 00:51:31,077
- Deny him the ball.
- So let's shut him down.

833
00:51:31,288 --> 00:51:32,778
and we gotta double-team
Cheaney. right?

834
00:51:32,989 --> 00:51:35,617
- So we'll cut Reynolds loose?
- Yeah. let's cut Reynolds loose.

835
00:51:35,826 --> 00:51:37,487
and then Graham out here.

836
00:51:37,694 --> 00:51:40,322
he's gonna take shots.
so we gotta shut him down.

837
00:51:40,530 --> 00:51:42,191
You gotta get up on him.

838
00:51:42,399 --> 00:51:43,889
All right. Yeah?

839
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:45,796
- Hi. coach.
- Hey. how you doing?

840
00:51:46,002 --> 00:51:49,403
- Can l talk to you a minute?
- Yeah. come on in. Bring a chair over.

841
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:51,096
- What's up?
- How you doing. Rick?

842
00:51:51,308 --> 00:51:53,139
- How are you guys doing?
- Played good out there.

843
00:51:53,343 --> 00:51:56,039
Oh. thanks.
That was a good workout.

844
00:51:57,114 --> 00:52:00,481
These girls out here. l look at them.
l gotta shake my head.

845
00:52:00,684 --> 00:52:03,346
l mean. l'm blown away.
l mean. these girls are amazing.

846
00:52:03,553 --> 00:52:05,578
l just shudder at it. but...

847
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:08,019
lt's great. and l think l'd like
to come to college.

848
00:52:08,225 --> 00:52:10,955
- All right. Good. Rick.
- Hey. that's great. Good.

849
00:52:11,561 --> 00:52:13,552
So l guess that leaves
a little bit of business

850
00:52:13,763 --> 00:52:15,697
we have to discuss. though. l think.

851
00:52:18,401 --> 00:52:19,390
Business?

852
00:52:19,603 --> 00:52:23,596
l figure a white. blue-chip athlete
like myself deserves something extra.

853
00:52:26,042 --> 00:52:28,135
So. you know.
this is what l'm looking for.

854
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:31,072
is about 30 grand.

855
00:52:32,716 --> 00:52:34,581
l'd like to have it in cash.

856
00:52:34,784 --> 00:52:37,776
and. you know. just toss it
in one of those gym bags you got.

857
00:52:38,088 --> 00:52:41,524
You know. l've seen a lot of things now.
l've been around a lot.

858
00:52:42,092 --> 00:52:44,856
You know. they've offered me
this much money already.

859
00:52:45,362 --> 00:52:49,992
lf you guys can match my offer.
l'm yours. coach.

860
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:59,506
Get the hell out of here. Ricky.

861
00:52:59,709 --> 00:53:02,405
Goddamn it. get the hell
out of here. Ricky. Get out of here!

862
00:53:02,612 --> 00:53:04,273
Get back in that gym. get your stuff.

863
00:53:04,481 --> 00:53:06,779
get the hell out of here
and go on home.

864
00:53:06,983 --> 00:53:10,475
Take off that damn uniform!
You don't deserve to wear it.

865
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:12,917
Get out of here!

866
00:53:13,123 --> 00:53:15,182
Son of a bitch.

867
00:53:16,326 --> 00:53:18,453
l wanna know nothing.

868
00:53:19,062 --> 00:53:22,395
You know about your football team?

869
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:24,294
- l know nothing.
- Oh. for chrissake. Vic.

870
00:53:24,501 --> 00:53:26,332
come on. tell me something.
Don't give me--

871
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:30,563
What the hell does
''l know nothing'' mean? Jesus.

872
00:53:32,909 --> 00:53:34,672
Listen to me.

873
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:36,845
Maybe if just once...

874
00:53:38,949 --> 00:53:40,678
...you get the ball players.

875
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:44,684
we just get things back
the way they were.

876
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:46,651
and we'd never have
to touch it again.

877
00:53:46,856 --> 00:53:51,884
How many times do l have to tell you?
l don't want any part of this.

878
00:55:16,109 --> 00:55:17,474
Coffee?

879
00:55:20,814 --> 00:55:22,406
Just tell me how it works.

880
00:55:23,050 --> 00:55:24,881
You don't wanna know how it works.
Let's just say

881
00:55:25,085 --> 00:55:27,349
there are friends of the program
who'll take care of everything.

882
00:55:27,554 --> 00:55:30,250
l hate friends of the program.

883
00:55:30,457 --> 00:55:33,085
Yeah. but you hate losing more.

884
00:55:34,328 --> 00:55:36,956
Relax. we're gonna be
on top again.

885
00:55:37,164 --> 00:55:39,098
l got a little confession to make too.

886
00:55:39,299 --> 00:55:42,962
l screw a hell of a lot better
when we're winning. don't you. huh?

887
00:56:31,685 --> 00:56:32,674
Mr. Bodeaux?

888
00:56:33,453 --> 00:56:35,683
- Yeah. what's up. bro?
- Congratulations.

889
00:56:35,889 --> 00:56:37,447
You're the owner
of a brand-new Lexus.

890
00:56:37,791 --> 00:56:38,815
l didn't ask for this.

891
00:56:39,026 --> 00:56:40,618
l just deliver them.
l don't know nothing.

892
00:56:42,062 --> 00:56:44,895
This one goes to the right
of the blue couch in the living room.

893
00:56:45,098 --> 00:56:47,965
This one goes opposite wall nearest
the den. and please wipe your feet.

894
00:56:48,168 --> 00:56:49,260
Yes. ma'am.

895
00:56:49,803 --> 00:56:51,327
Are you guys gonna
be hungry soon?

896
00:56:51,538 --> 00:56:54,473
- Yeah.
- Girls. are you hungry?

897
00:56:59,846 --> 00:57:02,747
- Who wants to play tennis?
- l do.

898
00:57:11,325 --> 00:57:12,519
- You Rick Roe?
- Yeah.

899
00:57:12,726 --> 00:57:15,661
- This is for you.
- Thanks.

900
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:28,198
Yeah.

901
00:57:30,243 --> 00:57:33,303
Okay. lt's done.

902
00:57:33,513 --> 00:57:35,413
Right.

903
00:57:52,733 --> 00:57:54,496
Letters of intent
from Butch McRae and Ricky Roe

904
00:57:54,701 --> 00:57:56,168
to attend Western University.

905
00:57:56,370 --> 00:57:58,065
He bought them. Charlie.
l know he bought them.

906
00:57:58,271 --> 00:58:00,762
- No way. Ed. not Pete Bell.
- Are you shitting me?

907
00:58:00,974 --> 00:58:02,805
He paid for them. baby.
l can smell it.

908
00:58:05,479 --> 00:58:08,073
- Yeah.
- l have a surprise for you.

909
00:58:08,281 --> 00:58:10,181
Mr. Bodeaux?

910
00:58:11,885 --> 00:58:14,217
960.

911
00:58:15,288 --> 00:58:17,483
- All right.
- He improved 440 points.

912
00:58:17,691 --> 00:58:20,558
- Somebody owes my ass $1 00.
- Way to go. Neon.

913
00:58:20,761 --> 00:58:23,594
- Way to go. Congratulations.
- Oh. look at this. What do l see?

914
00:58:23,797 --> 00:58:26,664
Somebody take him down to
Administration and show him around.

915
00:58:26,867 --> 00:58:28,266
Jenny. l'm gonna--

916
00:58:28,468 --> 00:58:30,197
Hold up. hold up.
You didn't hear what l said.

917
00:58:30,404 --> 00:58:32,338
Somebody here
owes my ass $1 00.

918
00:58:35,142 --> 00:58:37,633
And as the razor-sharp blade
of the sword of Sir Gawain

919
00:58:37,844 --> 00:58:40,108
descends a mighty blow
on the neck of the Green Knight.

920
00:58:40,313 --> 00:58:42,679
through the amazement of the steed
of verdant hue.

921
00:58:42,883 --> 00:58:45,283
and the head of the Green Knight.
thus lopped off cleanly.

922
00:58:45,485 --> 00:58:47,282
- What's he talking about?
- is kicked around

923
00:58:47,487 --> 00:58:50,149
like a soccer ball
by Arthur's noble warriors.

924
00:58:50,357 --> 00:58:53,520
Whereupon the headless
Green Knight strolls casually among

925
00:58:53,727 --> 00:58:57,857
Arthur's best and brightest.
reaches down. picks up his own head

926
00:58:58,065 --> 00:59:00,431
and places it back upon his shoulders.
where. magically.

927
00:59:00,634 --> 00:59:02,397
it becomes part of his body
once again.

928
00:59:02,602 --> 00:59:05,127
And there they dallied and drank
and deemed it good sport

929
00:59:05,338 --> 00:59:07,806
to enact their play anew
on New Year's Eve.

930
00:59:08,008 --> 00:59:10,442
But Gawain asked again
to go on the morrow.

931
00:59:10,644 --> 00:59:13,408
- The time until his trip is not two days.
- You see these legs. man?

932
00:59:13,613 --> 00:59:16,446
The host hindered that
and urged him to stay and said.

933
00:59:16,650 --> 00:59:18,447
- Where you going. man?
- ''On my honor. my oath.

934
00:59:18,652 --> 00:59:21,086
here l take that you shall
get to the Green Chapel

935
00:59:21,288 --> 00:59:24,018
to begin your chores
by dawn on New Year's Day.''

936
00:59:25,625 --> 00:59:27,752
This is a lecture. Mr. Bodeaux.
not a discussion.

937
00:59:27,961 --> 00:59:29,952
- May l speak?
- lt's not your place to speak.

938
00:59:30,163 --> 00:59:32,529
Well. l'm making it my place
to speak.

939
00:59:32,733 --> 00:59:35,861
l just wanna point out to this class
that this course is culturally biased.

940
00:59:37,771 --> 00:59:39,830
Culturally biased?
What do you mean by that?

941
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:43,009
How come we ain't talking about
African folk tales or something?

942
00:59:43,210 --> 00:59:45,405
Well. this is a course
in English literature.

943
00:59:45,612 --> 00:59:47,580
How come we're not
talking about African literature?

944
00:59:47,781 --> 00:59:49,305
Well. because we're not.

945
00:59:49,516 --> 00:59:52,542
l suppose you did read the course
description before you took this course.

946
00:59:53,253 --> 00:59:56,654
l gotta take this up with my coach.
You told me to take this.

947
00:59:56,857 --> 00:59:59,758
- That's certainly your privilege.
- Got me listening to this crap.

948
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:02,121
- l'm gonna keep my eye on you.
- All right. man.

949
01:00:02,329 --> 01:00:04,524
Thank you. Appreciate it.

950
01:00:04,965 --> 01:00:06,227
Now. let us continue.

951
01:00:07,067 --> 01:00:10,002
That's Butch's mom
in front of their new house in Chicago.

952
01:00:10,203 --> 01:00:13,730
The house is in her name with
a co-signer. who we can't locate.

953
01:00:14,441 --> 01:00:16,238
The bank officer
who approved the loan

954
01:00:16,443 --> 01:00:17,842
is an alumnus of Western U.

955
01:00:18,044 --> 01:00:19,477
- Friends of the program.
- You got it.

956
01:00:25,685 --> 01:00:28,813
Thataway.
Way to go. Butch. Way to go.

957
01:00:29,589 --> 01:00:31,489
Just go for the front of the rim. now.

958
01:00:31,691 --> 01:00:34,489
All right. let's do
some crossover. Butch.

959
01:00:36,263 --> 01:00:37,423
Nice form. Butch.

960
01:00:37,631 --> 01:00:39,792
That's Ricky's dad
in front of his new tractor.

961
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,298
Now. we can't prove anything
except Mr. Roe had bad credit.

962
01:00:42,502 --> 01:00:45,130
Too bad to be purchasing
new equipment.

963
01:00:45,338 --> 01:00:48,102
Now. the biggest distributor of
farm machinery in the state of lndiana

964
01:00:48,308 --> 01:00:51,209
was Happy Kuykendall's classmate.

965
01:00:51,411 --> 01:00:54,312
All right. Ricky. use the reverse.

966
01:00:55,882 --> 01:00:57,679
Attaboy.

967
01:00:57,884 --> 01:00:59,977
That's it. get square.

968
01:01:01,321 --> 01:01:02,481
Thataway. Ricky.

969
01:01:02,689 --> 01:01:04,623
That's the Lexus
they tried to give Neon.

970
01:01:04,825 --> 01:01:07,350
He didn't ask for it.
They tried to give it to him anyway.

971
01:01:12,566 --> 01:01:14,431
Stay low. don't come up.

972
01:01:17,370 --> 01:01:19,600
Extend that ball.
Protect it with your body.

973
01:01:19,806 --> 01:01:23,242
Now use your left.
Point the lead foot. unlock the left hip.

974
01:01:23,443 --> 01:01:25,468
All right. now take it in strong.

975
01:01:27,914 --> 01:01:31,850
These violations are flagrant.
but the paper trail is well covered up.

976
01:01:32,052 --> 01:01:34,111
We could never prove anything
against the football team.

977
01:01:34,321 --> 01:01:37,347
Hey. Charlie. we gotta keep digging.
lt's all right here.

978
01:01:37,557 --> 01:01:39,787
We're gonna get this guy.

979
01:01:40,293 --> 01:01:42,022
We're gonna get
the great Pete Bell.

980
01:01:42,229 --> 01:01:44,891
- l know. it's unbelievable.
- Right this way. Good to see you.

981
01:01:45,098 --> 01:01:47,089
- How are you doing?
- Good to see you.

982
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:49,234
Okay. All right.

983
01:01:49,436 --> 01:01:50,994
Looks like you're
back in business. coach.

984
01:01:51,204 --> 01:01:53,638
- With you?
- Don't get carried away.

985
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:55,273
- Hi. coach. Hi. Mrs. Bell.
- Hi.

986
01:01:55,475 --> 01:01:56,908
Hi.
So. what did you do.

987
01:01:57,110 --> 01:02:00,568
sell them on your recent losing
tradition so they know they'll start?

988
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:02,805
Well. there's an advantage
to having a losing season.

989
01:02:03,016 --> 01:02:05,041
- Enjoy your dinner.
- Thank you.

990
01:02:05,252 --> 01:02:06,719
Well...

991
01:02:07,687 --> 01:02:10,121
- l just wanted to say congratulations.
- Thanks.

992
01:02:10,323 --> 01:02:12,291
Getting the players you wanted
without selling out.

993
01:02:12,492 --> 01:02:15,859
You know. the rules. they don't make
much sense. they're hypocritical.

994
01:02:16,062 --> 01:02:18,963
There's a lot of people on the take.
and l can't blame them.

995
01:02:19,699 --> 01:02:21,792
- Why are you getting defensive?
- No. l'm not defensive.

996
01:02:22,002 --> 01:02:24,869
- Coach. may l have your autograph?
- Sure. you may. What's your name?

997
01:02:25,071 --> 01:02:26,766
- Andre.
- Andre. Okay.

998
01:02:26,973 --> 01:02:29,066
Saying you're not defensive
is defensive.

999
01:02:29,276 --> 01:02:33,406
Well. saying that l am defensive
means l am defensive.

1000
01:02:33,613 --> 01:02:36,980
So if l say that l'm not defensive.
then l am defensive. and if l say--

1001
01:02:37,183 --> 01:02:39,981
Thank you.
You know. l'm screwed either way.

1002
01:02:40,654 --> 01:02:44,112
Wait a minute.
look me straight in the eye.

1003
01:02:44,324 --> 01:02:46,588
- What?
- Did you cheat?

1004
01:02:49,496 --> 01:02:52,988
No. l did not cheat. Swear to God.

1005
01:02:55,602 --> 01:02:57,570
- You were getting so nervous about it.
- Excuse me.

1006
01:02:57,771 --> 01:02:58,999
- Yes.
- l hate to interrupt.

1007
01:02:59,205 --> 01:03:00,900
Do you think my son
could have your autograph?

1008
01:03:01,107 --> 01:03:02,699
- Sure. sure. What's your name?
- Mark.

1009
01:03:02,909 --> 01:03:05,844
Mark? Okay. you a
basketball player. Mark?

1010
01:03:06,046 --> 01:03:07,308
- Yeah.
- Oh. good.

1011
01:03:07,514 --> 01:03:11,041
Just a couple of
divorcees out on a date. right?

1012
01:03:11,351 --> 01:03:12,340
- There you go.
- Thank you.

1013
01:03:12,552 --> 01:03:13,610
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

1014
01:03:13,820 --> 01:03:17,017
Yes. we got a lot to celebrate.

1015
01:03:17,223 --> 01:03:21,091
And we're not screaming at each other.
Not yet. anyway.

1016
01:03:22,329 --> 01:03:25,696
You know. Jenny.
l'm crazy about you.

1017
01:03:25,899 --> 01:03:28,424
l always have been.
ever since we first met.

1018
01:03:28,635 --> 01:03:30,626
Did you know that?

1019
01:03:31,838 --> 01:03:34,773
Okay. l just wanted you to know.

1020
01:03:35,375 --> 01:03:36,842

Come on. Back. back. back.
Forward. forward. forward. Let's go.

1027
01:03:59,032 --> 01:04:00,659
All right. let's go.

1028
01:04:00,867 --> 01:04:03,165
Two lines. Let's go.

1029
01:04:06,072 --> 01:04:07,801
Get that ball. Get the ball.

1030
01:04:08,008 --> 01:04:09,703
Here we go. Get that ball.

1031
01:04:09,909 --> 01:04:12,639
All right. now. spin baseline.
There it is. there it is. there it is.

1032
01:04:12,846 --> 01:04:15,610
All right. try it the other way.
Now spin to the middle.

1033
01:04:15,815 --> 01:04:18,079
That's it. That's it. Neon. That's it.

1034
01:04:18,284 --> 01:04:20,809
lf you feel his body going on
this side of you. spin that way.

1035
01:04:21,021 --> 01:04:23,182
lf you feel this side...
Feel him. Feel him.

1036
01:04:23,390 --> 01:04:26,086
Think. think. think.
lt's a thinking man's game.

1037
01:04:28,395 --> 01:04:30,955
All right. hold. hold. Butch.
Butch. wait a minute.

1038
01:04:31,164 --> 01:04:33,689
You gotta take that screener.
you gotta make that fake.

1039
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:35,265
You gotta bring the screener...

1040
01:04:35,468 --> 01:04:38,767
You gotta bring that man down here
so the screen can be set on him.

1041
01:04:38,972 --> 01:04:42,703
l mean. you gotta take Mitchell...
Turn around. Mitch.

1042
01:04:42,909 --> 01:04:46,504
Take him this way so that this screen
can come around and be set on him.

1043
01:04:46,713 --> 01:04:49,876
Look. Butch. l'll tell you something.
You can even take a shot fake here.

1044
01:04:50,083 --> 01:04:52,779
You can take a shot fake.
lf you get the man going up.

1045
01:04:52,986 --> 01:04:57,252
you can go in this side here. You can
roll this way and come this way.

1046
01:04:57,457 --> 01:04:59,550
But you gotta make a fake
before you move.

1047
01:05:00,193 --> 01:05:01,683
Fake there.

1048
01:05:02,262 --> 01:05:05,595
There it is. There it is.
there it is. There it is.

1049
01:05:05,799 --> 01:05:08,825
See what that does? That takes that
man down. Now that pick can get set.

1050
01:05:09,035 --> 01:05:10,764
- l thought that's what l was doing.
- No. no.

1051
01:05:10,970 --> 01:05:12,995
You took the ball.
you just took off around that way.

1052
01:05:13,206 --> 01:05:16,266
Play this two-man game.
Son. play the two-man game.

1053
01:05:16,476 --> 01:05:17,909
For chrissake.
between you and Neon.

1054
01:05:18,111 --> 01:05:21,080
it's gonna be a great two-man
game. okay? All right. let's do it.

1055
01:05:21,281 --> 01:05:22,873
- Hit the board.

1056
01:05:23,083 --> 01:05:25,574
- Hit the board.
- Give it up. Give the ball up. big man.

1057
01:05:25,785 --> 01:05:27,685
There you go.

01:05:30,523 --> 01:05:31,717
Hold it. hold it.

01:05:31,925 --> 01:05:34,951
Butch. get that shirt off.

1060
01:05:35,161 --> 01:05:37,425
Phil. take Butch's place.

1061
01:05:37,630 --> 01:05:39,962
You're not going back on blue
until you get it right.

1062
01:05:40,166 --> 01:05:41,133
Come on. let's go.

1063
01:05:41,334 --> 01:05:42,892
That may be
the whole goddamn season.

1064
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:02,217
- Coach.
- Yeah.

1065
01:06:02,422 --> 01:06:03,980
- l need to talk to you.
- Okay. All right.

1066
01:06:04,190 --> 01:06:07,318
Hey. Freddie.
can you go run Dennis?

1067
01:06:07,527 --> 01:06:09,495
Come on in. Butch.

1068
01:06:09,863 --> 01:06:11,763
What is it. Butch?

1069
01:06:12,365 --> 01:06:15,766
- Coach. l need to talk to you.
- Sure. sure. Go ahead.

1070
01:06:15,969 --> 01:06:19,166
- Coach. l'm homesick.
- You're homesick?

1071
01:06:19,372 --> 01:06:22,000
Homesick. huh?
Well. let me tell you something. Butch.

1072
01:06:22,208 --> 01:06:23,732
every year. a couple of guys
come in here

1073
01:06:23,943 --> 01:06:26,411
and tell me they're homesick.
Now. everything is gonna be fine

1074
01:06:26,613 --> 01:06:28,240
once this season starts. You'll see.

1075
01:06:28,448 --> 01:06:31,884
No. coach. l don't belong here. l mean.
l've never ran the motion offense.

1076
01:06:32,085 --> 01:06:34,144
That's not my style.
l need to be in a one-four offense.

1077
01:06:34,354 --> 01:06:36,549
where l can handle the ball
and dish to other people.

1078
01:06:36,756 --> 01:06:39,748
Butch. let me tell you something.
l don't know if it's the right way.

1079
01:06:39,959 --> 01:06:42,792
- but goddamn it. it's my way.
- Coach. l don't belong here.

1080
01:06:42,996 --> 01:06:45,556
l guess what l'm really trying to say is.
if l left school.

1081
01:06:45,765 --> 01:06:47,733
would my mom lose
her house and job?

1082
01:06:52,405 --> 01:06:55,932
Butch. you know.
l don't know anything about that.

1083
01:06:56,142 --> 01:06:59,202
Coach. l think you're gonna have to
know something about this.

1084
01:06:59,412 --> 01:07:01,937
Coach. this is my mom.
this is a life situation.

1085
01:07:02,148 --> 01:07:04,514
l don't know. you know.
but if your mother...

1086
01:07:04,717 --> 01:07:07,413
lf you made some arrangements
that l don't know about.

1087
01:07:07,620 --> 01:07:11,886
then l think you're gonna have to live
up to those responsibilities. that's all.

1088
01:07:12,091 --> 01:07:14,753
What responsibilities are you talking
about? l'm talking about my mom.

1089
01:07:14,961 --> 01:07:17,122
Well. l don't know. You're the one
that's brought them up.

1090
01:07:17,330 --> 01:07:19,298
so you're really talking
to the wrong guy. Butch.

1091
01:07:19,499 --> 01:07:21,660
No. l'm talking to the right guy.
and l'm not leaving here

1092
01:07:21,868 --> 01:07:23,426
until you tell me an answer.

1093
01:07:23,636 --> 01:07:28,437
Well. l told you. Butch.
l really don't have any answers for you.

1094
01:07:28,641 --> 01:07:31,269
- l don't know anything about it.
- You have to have some answers.

1095
01:07:31,878 --> 01:07:35,746
Look. Butch. l don't know what kind
of arrangements you've made. so--

1096
01:07:35,949 --> 01:07:38,417
ls there someone you can call
to see if l left school.

1097
01:07:38,618 --> 01:07:40,643
my mom would keep
her house and job?

1098
01:08:04,777 --> 01:08:07,439
Hey. coach. how you doing?

1099
01:08:07,981 --> 01:08:09,608
Butch?

1100
01:08:10,049 --> 01:08:14,577
Arrangement? Arrangement. my ass.
lf that son of a bitch is unhappy.

1101
01:08:14,787 --> 01:08:17,449
it's your job to make him happy.

1102
01:08:17,657 --> 01:08:19,887
Listen. you can sell ice
to the Eskimos.

1103
01:08:20,093 --> 01:08:23,119
You can sell this spoiled brat
on how happy he really is.

1104
01:08:23,329 --> 01:08:24,887
l don't even wanna have
this conversation.

1105
01:08:25,098 --> 01:08:28,625
Butch's mother has got a new job
and a new house with a lawn.

1106
01:08:28,835 --> 01:08:31,668
That is happy enough, you got it?

1107
01:08:37,944 --> 01:08:40,412
Better be at practice on Monday.

1108
01:08:51,724 --> 01:08:58,152
Ladies and gentlemen. your coach.

1110
01:09:17,250 --> 01:09:20,083
Good. look. Pete left
these tapes at the house.

1111
01:09:20,286 --> 01:09:21,480
Could you give them
to him for me?

1112
01:09:21,688 --> 01:09:22,655
- Sure.
- Okay. great.

1113
01:09:22,855 --> 01:09:25,688
Listen. we're going to the Belgrade
after the show to have some drinks.

1123
01:09:47,380 --> 01:09:51,373
- He's a friend of the program.
- Happy is a friend of the program?

1124
01:09:52,552 --> 01:09:55,020
Come on. Jenny.
l mean. you know how things are.

1125
01:10:02,362 --> 01:10:04,990
Mel. l don't think l'll have that drink.

1126
01:10:07,433 --> 01:10:09,833
l don't give a damn who does it.

1127
01:10:10,036 --> 01:10:12,561
- lt's all up to Neon and Butch.

- What did l do wrong. coach?
- What are you doing here?

1130
01:10:17,977 --> 01:10:20,002
Don't you think we ought

1131
01:10:20,213 --> 01:10:22,647
- Yeah. l better get out of here.
- Oh. there you go.

1132
01:10:22,849 --> 01:10:24,339
- What is this?
- What?

1133
01:10:24,550 --> 01:10:27,314
What is this?
Did you give him a car?

1134
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:30,819
- Did he give you a car?
- Just a loaner. coach. l'll give it back.

1135
01:10:31,023 --> 01:10:33,719
He's gonna give it back. relax.

1136
01:10:35,628 --> 01:10:38,859
Get the hell out of here. Ricky.
You get home. l'll call you later.

1137
01:10:39,065 --> 01:10:42,762
You son of a bitch.
l do not want you around my kids.

1138
01:10:42,969 --> 01:10:45,597
Oh. your kids? You sound like

01:10:45,805 --> 01:10:49,297
- Get your finger out of my face.
- l did not authorize a car for Ricky.

1140
01:10:49,509 --> 01:10:52,876
But you did authorize the friends of
the program to do what had to be done.

1141
01:10:53,079 --> 01:10:56,276
Listen. l'm gonna tell you something
right now. Ricky is a farm kid.

1142
01:10:56,482 --> 01:10:59,178
He's gonna take that car.
he's gonna blab all over town.

1143
01:10:59,385 --> 01:11:01,876
Tell him to shut up.
You're the coach.

1144
01:11:02,088 --> 01:11:03,749
Listen. you gotta
understand something.

1145
01:11:03,956 --> 01:11:08,154
The friends of the program are
my friends. and they are friends for life.

1146
01:11:08,361 --> 01:11:11,626
What they've done is untraceable.
What l've done is unprovable.

1147
01:11:11,831 --> 01:11:16,291
There will be no smoking gun.
because l am the smoking gun.

1148
01:11:16,769 --> 01:11:19,897
Now. relax. lt's all working.

1149
01:11:21,574 --> 01:11:25,066
Happy. you're a scumbag.
you know that?

1150
01:11:34,353 --> 01:11:37,186
l didn't break any laws. You did.

1151
01:11:37,390 --> 01:11:39,085
You broke the collegiate
athletic laws.

1152
01:11:39,292 --> 01:11:41,317
lt's your career that's on the line.
not mine.

1153
01:11:41,527 --> 01:11:44,018
- My career is in my own hands.
- l own you.

1154
01:11:44,630 --> 01:11:48,157
l just open my mouth. rumors start
to fly. about you. for instance.

1155
01:11:48,768 --> 01:11:51,601
l've lived through accusations.
l walked away from them.

1156
01:11:51,804 --> 01:11:55,672
The alleged point-shaving incident?
Think again. that thing happened.

1157
01:11:58,044 --> 01:12:00,012
Get out of here.

1158
01:12:06,085 --> 01:12:07,052
Tell me about it.

1159
01:12:07,253 --> 01:12:11,622
Why don't you try this one.
January 1 6th. three years ago.

1160
01:12:11,824 --> 01:12:14,122
l bought one of your boys. coach.

1161
01:12:14,327 --> 01:12:17,023
No kid of mine
would ever fix a game.

1162
01:12:17,230 --> 01:12:19,824
Why don't you just go
to the videotape. coach.

1163
01:12:20,032 --> 01:12:24,492
l own you. Pete. You're mine.

1164
01:13:04,544 --> 01:13:06,341
What's going on. Pete?

1165
01:13:09,015 --> 01:13:12,917
Happy said somebody shaved
some points three years ago.

1166
01:13:18,958 --> 01:13:21,017
Happy's full of shit. coach.

1167
01:13:21,594 --> 01:13:23,892
l remember this game.
l remember seeing this on TV

1168
01:13:24,096 --> 01:13:26,326
when l was coaching Oklahoma.
You guys won this by eight.

1169
01:13:26,532 --> 01:13:28,159
- Yeah.
- Yeah. There's Tony.

1170
01:13:28,367 --> 01:13:30,494
- Oh. yeah. sweet J.
- That was his spot. wasn't it?

1171
01:13:30,703 --> 01:13:32,671
- Goddamn.
- Bang them from right there.

1172
01:13:32,872 --> 01:13:34,430
- Oh. nice.
- Bam. look at that.

1173
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:36,005
What was the spread?

1174
01:13:36,208 --> 01:13:39,302
- What? Point spread?
- What was the point spread?

1175
01:13:39,712 --> 01:13:42,180
- Point spread? We won the game.
- We won the game.

1176
01:13:42,381 --> 01:13:44,815
Matter of fact. we were up by a lot.
they came back on us.

1177
01:13:45,017 --> 01:13:46,917
lt was a pretty good year.
we were 1 6 and...

1178
01:13:47,119 --> 01:13:48,609
- Sixteen and 1 2.
- Twelve?

1179
01:13:48,821 --> 01:13:50,914
Yeah. went to NlT
and lost the first round.

1180
01:13:51,390 --> 01:13:54,086
- Should've won 20 that year.
- No. this was a rebuilding year. man.

1181
01:13:54,293 --> 01:13:56,488
All these guys were freshmen.
they were kids.

1182
01:14:03,069 --> 01:14:05,697
- How many did he hit?
- Twenty-two. 23.

1183
01:14:05,905 --> 01:14:08,339
- Twenty-five points that night.
- Yeah.

1184
01:14:08,541 --> 01:14:11,533
- He was all over the place.
- Yeah. he was hot.

1185
01:14:12,244 --> 01:14:15,407
Guy just blew right by him. Standing
there with his thumb up his ass.

1186
01:14:15,615 --> 01:14:17,207
He pulled a hamstring
at practice that week.

1187
01:14:17,416 --> 01:14:19,543
- Shouldn't have been playing.
- He was tough. though.

1188
01:14:19,752 --> 01:14:21,310
What was he doing
playing with a hamstring?

1189
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:22,817
Tough-ass kid from Chicago.

1190
01:14:24,890 --> 01:14:27,484
Now. who the hell did he--?
See. there's nobody there.

1191
01:14:27,693 --> 01:14:29,718
Come on. we averaged 1 7 turnovers
as a team that year.

1192
01:14:29,929 --> 01:14:32,454
Everybody was
throwing the ball away.

1193
01:14:32,965 --> 01:14:35,593
Hell. he averaged 20 points
a game that year. man.

1194
01:14:35,801 --> 01:14:37,428
Shit. he was all-conference
as a freshman.

1195
01:14:37,637 --> 01:14:39,400
Yeah. on offense.

1196
01:14:39,672 --> 01:14:41,606
Run a clean program here. man.

1197
01:14:41,807 --> 01:14:44,571
We worked hard
to keep this program clean.

1198
01:14:46,579 --> 01:14:49,707
l guarantee you didn't cover
the spread that night.

1199
01:14:49,915 --> 01:14:54,716
There must have been heavy action
in Vegas. Somebody got rich.

1200
01:14:55,821 --> 01:14:58,915
The worst case of ballhandling l've
seen in the two years l've been here.

1201
01:14:59,125 --> 01:15:01,992
Look. he was a freshman. Freddie.
He was making freshman mistakes.

1202
01:15:02,194 --> 01:15:07,188
- He had a bad leg too. don't forget.
- All night. All night. Mistakes all night.

1203
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,695
Look at coach on his ass.

1204
01:15:09,902 --> 01:15:12,666
Coach is still on his ass
four years later.

1205
01:15:13,739 --> 01:15:17,368
No way. No way.

1206
01:15:18,944 --> 01:15:21,208
Looking at the clock again.

1207
01:15:22,348 --> 01:15:24,680
That's a good kid. man.

1208
01:15:25,418 --> 01:15:29,514
Now. what kind of shot's that?
What kind of shot?

1209
01:15:31,724 --> 01:15:34,318
- There's another bad pass.
- Shut up. Freddie.

1210
01:15:34,927 --> 01:15:38,328
All right. Tony was my guy.
All right? My guy.

1211
01:15:39,665 --> 01:15:41,257
Tony.

1212
01:15:54,146 --> 01:15:55,773
Tony.

1213
01:15:55,981 --> 01:15:59,382
Tony. open the door. lt's me.

1214
01:16:00,820 --> 01:16:02,515
Tony!

1215
01:16:03,289 --> 01:16:04,551
Coach. what's up?

1216
01:16:04,757 --> 01:16:06,725
You've gotta tell me the truth.
You tell me the truth.

1217
01:16:06,926 --> 01:16:09,520
- What's up with you. man?
- Did you or did you not shave points?

1218
01:16:09,729 --> 01:16:12,061
Coach. man. it's me. Tony.
l didn't do something like that.

1219
01:16:12,264 --> 01:16:15,358
Cut the bullshit.
Did you take money?

1220
01:16:15,568 --> 01:16:20,164
- Did you shave points?
- No. l didn't. l swear to God. no.

1221
01:16:25,544 --> 01:16:27,034
Son of a bitch.

1222
01:16:27,246 --> 01:16:30,374
- Come on. coach. l would not--
- You tell me the truth!

1223
01:16:30,583 --> 01:16:32,915
- What's wrong with you. man?
- You tell me the truth!

1224
01:16:33,119 --> 01:16:35,815
Just once! Man. just one.

1225
01:16:36,021 --> 01:16:38,990
l mean. we won
the damn game. right?

1226
01:16:40,659 --> 01:16:43,992
We didn't cover the goddamn spread.
l mean. who cares about the spread?

1227
01:16:44,196 --> 01:16:46,460
That's just for the damn gamblers.
ain't it?

1228
01:16:46,665 --> 01:16:48,496
Coach. man. l'm sorry.

1229
01:16:57,777 --> 01:17:00,302
l'm sorry. coach.

1230
01:17:05,885 --> 01:17:09,844
Son. haven't l always
been there for you?

1231
01:17:10,489 --> 01:17:12,150
Whether your girlfriend
got pregnant

1232
01:17:12,358 --> 01:17:15,088
or you're flunking TV
or whatever the hell it is.

1233
01:17:15,661 --> 01:17:18,289
Are you a better basketball player
because of me?

1234
01:17:18,497 --> 01:17:20,124
Are you a better man?

1235
01:17:20,332 --> 01:17:22,766
Yes. Yes.

1236
01:17:22,968 --> 01:17:25,459
You lied to me. Tony.

1237
01:17:25,838 --> 01:17:29,604
Son. you took the purest thing
in your life.

1238
01:17:29,809 --> 01:17:34,542
and you corrupted it.
And for what? For what?

1239
01:18:08,881 --> 01:18:10,542
Jenny.

1240
01:18:21,026 --> 01:18:23,221
Jenny. l gotta talk.

1241
01:18:23,629 --> 01:18:26,996
- lt's 1 :00 in the morning.
- Well. come on. it's me.

1242
01:18:27,199 --> 01:18:30,362
- That's another reason.
- Why? What's wrong?

1243
01:18:30,569 --> 01:18:32,764
You looked me straight in the eye.

1244
01:18:32,972 --> 01:18:35,440
and you lied to me...

1245
01:18:35,841 --> 01:18:40,301
...without a hesitation.
And l believed you.

1246
01:18:40,512 --> 01:18:44,505
God. Jenny. l'm sorry.

1247
01:18:44,984 --> 01:18:46,645
l'm so sorry.

1248
01:18:46,852 --> 01:18:51,289
So l don't trust myself
around you anymore.

1249
01:18:51,490 --> 01:18:56,689
because l thought l knew you
and l don't. so you can't come in.

1250
01:18:57,329 --> 01:18:58,796
- Jenny. wait.
- Don't.

1251
01:18:58,998 --> 01:19:02,126
No. wait. Listen to me.
Three years ago...

1252
01:19:02,334 --> 01:19:05,428
Three years ago.
Happy bought Tony.

1253
01:19:06,405 --> 01:19:11,707
The alleged incident is true.
Happy owns Tony. He owns me.

1254
01:19:11,911 --> 01:19:14,379
- l coached a fixed game.
- No. you didn't.

1255
01:19:14,580 --> 01:19:17,572
No. l coached a fixed game.
l talked to Tony. for chrissake.

1256
01:19:17,783 --> 01:19:20,081
Tony admitted it to me.

1257
01:19:27,059 --> 01:19:29,653
- Can we just have a drink?
- No.

1258
01:19:29,929 --> 01:19:34,423
l know you're feeling abandoned. but
l can't help you with anything anymore.

1259
01:19:34,633 --> 01:19:36,794
Lock the door before you leave.

1260
01:20:37,429 --> 01:20:39,488
All right. boys.

1261
01:20:42,768 --> 01:20:47,432
We got a job to do. We got a job.

1262
01:20:47,639 --> 01:20:50,767
Now. goddamn it. we're not
going out there to make a good show

1263
01:20:50,976 --> 01:20:53,308
or just put up a good fight.

1264
01:20:54,513 --> 01:20:55,639
We're going out there to beat

1265
01:20:55,848 --> 01:20:59,011
the best goddamn team
in the country right now.

1266
01:21:01,620 --> 01:21:04,817
Now. let me tell you something. boys.
You may not know this. but l know it.

1267
01:21:05,024 --> 01:21:06,150
l've been there before.

1268
01:21:06,358 --> 01:21:09,555
There is the talent in this room
to do just that.

1269
01:21:09,762 --> 01:21:12,026
To beat lndiana.

1270
01:21:13,766 --> 01:21:15,859
All right. Butch. the ball is yours.

1271
01:21:18,237 --> 01:21:21,070
And our first option
is to get the ball in to Neon.

1272
01:21:21,273 --> 01:21:25,175
And. Neon. goddamn it. you take it
to the basket and you take it hard.

1273
01:21:25,377 --> 01:21:27,572
Now. they're gonna make
an adjustment.

1274
01:21:27,780 --> 01:21:31,409
and when they adjust and
double down and triple down on Neon.

1275
01:21:31,617 --> 01:21:33,278
we're gonna move the ball
out to Ricky.

1276
01:21:33,919 --> 01:21:37,548
And. Ricky. you can put it up
from where you're at all night long.

1277
01:21:37,756 --> 01:21:41,692
The basket is the same height as it
was at your father's barn in lndiana.

1278
01:21:43,062 --> 01:21:46,088
Boys. lndiana is over there
in the other locker room

1279
01:21:46,298 --> 01:21:48,596
wondering what the hell
we're gonna do.

1280
01:21:48,801 --> 01:21:50,769
Well. l'll send a note over
to Bobby Knight.

1281
01:21:50,969 --> 01:21:52,960
and l'll tell him exactly
what we're gonna do.

1282
01:21:53,172 --> 01:21:55,470
l'll give him our offense.
l'll give him our defense.

1283
01:21:55,674 --> 01:21:59,405
Because it's not what you do.
goddamn it. it's how you do it.

1284
01:21:59,611 --> 01:22:01,306
Now. we're gonna go
nose-to-nose with them.

1285
01:22:01,513 --> 01:22:03,572
and we're gonna beat them
at both ends of the court.

1286
01:22:03,782 --> 01:22:06,216
And you're gonna play better
than you ever dreamed of

1287
01:22:06,418 --> 01:22:09,717
because. goddamn it.
that's what l demand of you.

1288
01:22:09,922 --> 01:22:11,287
All right. let's go.

1289
01:22:29,675 --> 01:22:31,404
Hi. everybody. l'm Dick Vitale.

1290
01:22:31,610 --> 01:22:33,703
Tonight is the night
we've been waiting for.

1291
01:22:33,912 --> 01:22:38,576
Basketball fever. Unbelievable. baby.
Kicking off the new season.

1292
01:22:38,784 --> 01:22:41,252
Western University.
coached by Pete Bell.

1293
01:22:41,453 --> 01:22:43,318
two national championships.

1294
01:22:43,522 --> 01:22:46,719
coming off a subpar year. against
the number-one team in the nation.

1295
01:22:46,925 --> 01:22:48,483
the lndiana Hoosiers.

1296
01:22:48,694 --> 01:22:51,458
Yes. Pete Bell wants to start winning.
What did he do?

1297
01:22:51,663 --> 01:22:54,223
He recruited the best
freshman class in America.

1298
01:22:54,433 --> 01:22:56,594
Three dynamic diaper dandies.

That's right. Butch McRae.

1303
01:23:10,916 --> 01:23:13,043

This place will be
rocking 'n' rolling.

1312
01:23:34,439 --> 01:23:36,236
The Hoosiers are
number one in the nation.

1313
01:23:36,441 --> 01:23:40,002
Western University. quite a
turnaround this season from last year.

1315
01:23:43,015 --> 01:23:45,142

1317
01:23:52,891 --> 01:23:54,552
Let's go. baby. Heads up. now.

1318
01:23:58,764 --> 01:24:01,426
Let's go. Thattaboy. Thattaboy!

1319
01:24:01,633 --> 01:24:04,329
- Hit the boards. hit the boards.
- Rick.

1320
01:24:05,470 --> 01:24:07,768
Come on. Kevin.
you gotta get on him.

1321
01:24:09,408 --> 01:24:12,309
Pick up the ball.
Move out of there. Kevin.

1322
01:24:12,511 --> 01:24:14,877
Screen. Screen.

1323
01:24:18,150 --> 01:24:20,277
Nice pass. Butch.

1324
01:24:20,485 --> 01:24:22,419
All right. Way to move. guys.

1325
01:24:26,658 --> 01:24:28,683
Beat those cutters.

1326
01:24:29,061 --> 01:24:32,053
Move. Joe. don't stand.

1327
01:24:32,898 --> 01:24:35,389
Rebound! Rebound!

1328
01:24:35,601 --> 01:24:36,568
All right. all right.

1329
01:24:36,768 --> 01:24:39,168
Let's get some movement going.
Like if the guard--

1330
01:24:39,371 --> 01:24:44,638
Say. Bob dribbles the ball off.
step up. reverse it. step out and go.

1331
01:24:44,843 --> 01:24:47,243
And then just get some
back-picking going.

1332
01:24:47,446 --> 01:24:51,439
Put them in some situations
where they gotta switch.

1333
01:24:51,650 --> 01:24:54,881
We've gotta be alert for the back pick.
They're back-picking us like crazy.

1334
01:24:55,087 --> 01:24:56,987
So when they come up
and set that back pick.

1335
01:24:57,189 --> 01:24:59,555
make sure that back man steps up.

1336
01:24:59,758 --> 01:25:02,283
Now. listen. On offense.
let's force them to switch.

1337
01:25:02,494 --> 01:25:03,620
You force them to switch.

1338
01:25:03,829 --> 01:25:07,230
And set some screens. goddamn it.
We haven't been doing that all night.

1339
01:25:10,602 --> 01:25:13,730
Get out on the ball. Ricky.
Close out quicker.

1340
01:25:14,139 --> 01:25:17,472
- Play some defense. Greg.
- Run the motion. let's go.

1341
01:25:19,278 --> 01:25:20,939
- Come on!
- Goddamn it.

1342
01:25:21,146 --> 01:25:25,276
- Kevin. get out on the ball.
- Beat the cutter. Butch.

1343
01:25:26,051 --> 01:25:27,313
Attaboy.

1344
01:25:29,187 --> 01:25:32,679
- That's nice. Butch.
- Oh. no.

1345
01:25:32,891 --> 01:25:35,052
And one. baby.

1346
01:25:35,460 --> 01:25:37,690
Way to go. Butch. Way to go. Butch.

1347
01:25:38,163 --> 01:25:40,825
Weak side. rotate. rotate.

1348
01:25:41,033 --> 01:25:42,523
Blow your goddamn whistle.

1349
01:25:43,302 --> 01:25:47,136
He got that ball on the way up. What
the hell call is that. for chrissake?

1350
01:25:47,339 --> 01:25:48,636
Oh. shit.

Give it back. Phil.

1357
01:26:08,360 --> 01:26:09,327
Yeah!

1358
01:26:10,495 --> 01:26:13,123
Whole new look. baby.
Whole new look.

1359
01:26:13,598 --> 01:26:14,792
Get that stuff out of here.

1360
01:26:18,737 --> 01:26:20,864
Let's go. set up the lanes.
Let's go.

1361
01:26:22,474 --> 01:26:24,203
- Set it up. Butch.
- Let's go.

1362
01:26:24,409 --> 01:26:26,809
- Look inside.
- Patience. baby. Little patience.

1363
01:26:27,012 --> 01:26:29,640
Take it up strong. Neon.

1364
01:26:37,556 --> 01:26:40,992
Bobby starts across with it.
Keith. you're over here.

1365
01:26:41,193 --> 01:26:43,093

Calbert starts across.

1367
01:26:49,334 --> 01:26:50,301
Good dish.

1368

All right. Ricky. l want you to fake out.
go along the baseline

1369
01:26:54,272 --> 01:26:55,864
and curl around that screen.

1370
01:26:56,074 --> 01:27:00,067
Walker. you bring it back to Phil. Phil.
dribble it on down. hand it off to Ricky.

1371
01:27:00,278 --> 01:27:03,270
Ricky. you come out to the foul line.
You should have a shot right here.

1372
01:27:03,482 --> 01:27:05,746
Hands. hands. hands. hands.

1373
01:27:05,951 --> 01:27:08,385
- Right through.
- Right there. Phil. hand it off.

1374
01:27:08,820 --> 01:27:10,082
Let it fly.

1375
01:27:12,324 --> 01:27:15,384
Basket by number 42, Ricky Roe.

1376
01:27:15,594 --> 01:27:17,892
Move the ball on the perimeter
and screen.

1377
01:27:18,096 --> 01:27:20,963
- Come on. Little defense.
- He's got the ball now.

1378
01:27:21,166 --> 01:27:25,227
Gotta help him. gotta help him.
Nice. nice. nice.

1379
01:27:25,437 --> 01:27:27,234
Fast break.

1380
01:27:35,247 --> 01:27:37,681
lf you haven't got the ball.
roll. for chrissake.

1381
01:27:37,883 --> 01:27:39,874
Let's just don't play
this throw-it-up game.

1382
01:27:40,085 --> 01:27:42,815
When you guys are on top.
you guards. make a move inside.

1383
01:27:43,021 --> 01:27:45,546
Don't stand there looking
for somebody. get it moving.

1384
01:28:04,443 --> 01:28:07,640
Stop the ball! Stop the ball!

1385
01:28:07,846 --> 01:28:10,610
lf he's over his back. that's a foul.

1386
01:28:11,049 --> 01:28:13,347
- What?
- l can't see it from the tram.

1387
01:28:13,552 --> 01:28:15,577
- l can't--
- That's bullshit!

1388
01:28:15,787 --> 01:28:17,652
Well. you can sure as hell
see the guy over him.

1389
01:28:17,856 --> 01:28:20,518
Then move your fat ass
down where you can see.

1390
01:28:21,893 --> 01:28:23,690
Stop the ball.

1391
01:28:24,162 --> 01:28:27,097
Basket by number 50, Eric Riley.

1392
01:28:27,299 --> 01:28:30,359
He's going all night like that
if you don't stop the ball.

1393
01:28:30,569 --> 01:28:32,537
Good hands. Good hands. Phil.

1394
01:28:34,406 --> 01:28:36,033
All right.

1395
01:28:37,342 --> 01:28:38,673
Stop ball! Stop ball!

1396
01:28:38,877 --> 01:28:40,811
Go. l got it. l got it. Get out the way.

1397
01:28:41,580 --> 01:28:43,377
By yourself.

1398
01:28:50,889 --> 01:28:53,653
Watch the clock. and we get down
into the last ten or 1 2 seconds.

1399
01:28:53,859 --> 01:28:54,985
we can take the shot.

1400
01:28:55,193 --> 01:28:57,320
But let's make them work
to play defense now.

1401
01:28:57,529 --> 01:29:00,555
No quick shots
unless it's off the break. period.

1402
01:29:03,535 --> 01:29:06,936
- Jump. jump. jump
- Pump fake.

1403
01:29:09,441 --> 01:29:11,534
Come on. cut him off.

1404
01:29:12,744 --> 01:29:15,645
Basket by number 34, Dan Godfried.

1405
01:29:15,847 --> 01:29:17,644
Here we go.

1406
01:29:19,284 --> 01:29:22,151
That leaves us with, l think, a little
business that we need to discuss.

1407
01:29:23,154 --> 01:29:26,487
You know, this is what l'm looking for,
30 grand. l'd like to have it in cash.

1408
01:29:27,926 --> 01:29:30,588
Why don't you just go
to the videotape, coach.

1409
01:29:30,795 --> 01:29:32,592
l own you.

1410
01:29:32,797 --> 01:29:35,561
You looked me straight in the eye,
and you lied to me.

1411
01:29:36,468 --> 01:29:38,060
And l believed you.

1412
01:29:43,108 --> 01:29:44,336
Call a timeout.

1413
01:29:48,213 --> 01:29:49,942
Butch. dribble on over here.
Mitch. come back.

1414
01:29:50,148 --> 01:29:51,547
get the pass back from Butch.

1415
01:29:51,750 --> 01:29:54,651
Give it right back to him
and go down to the low post.

1416
01:29:54,853 --> 01:29:57,048
Neon. as soon as you see
Butch going over.

1417
01:29:57,255 --> 01:29:58,745
you flash out to the foul line.

1418
01:29:58,957 --> 01:30:01,585
Mitch. l want you to come right up
on Neon's man.

1419
01:30:01,793 --> 01:30:04,762
l mean. screen him.
Pin him hard. Pin him.

1420
01:30:04,963 --> 01:30:08,763
Neon. you reverse. go to the
weak side. go up for the lob.

1421
01:30:08,967 --> 01:30:12,562
We've got 1 2 seconds. Butch. when
you get it in to Neon. you get it in high.

1422
01:30:12,771 --> 01:30:14,636
Finish it. big man.

1423
01:30:15,407 --> 01:30:16,931
This is the number-one team
in the nation.

1424
01:30:17,142 --> 01:30:20,407
We can beat their ass tonight.
We're in this game. Let's go. All right.

1425
01:30:20,612 --> 01:30:22,239
One. two. three. Western!

1426
01:30:22,781 --> 01:30:24,248
All right.

1427
01:30:25,116 --> 01:30:26,481
Let's go.

1428
01:30:31,089 --> 01:30:34,320
Come on. Right now. right now.

1429
01:30:36,194 --> 01:30:39,163
Here we go. Here we go.

1430

No foul. No foul.

1431
01:30:48,139 --> 01:30:50,300
Move the ball. Push the ball.

1432
01:30:50,508 --> 01:30:53,170
Now. Mitch. now. Pin him. pin him.

1433

Boys...

1446
01:32:35,547 --> 01:32:38,380
...the rules don't make much sense.

1447
01:32:41,953 --> 01:32:44,615
But l believe in rules.

1448
01:32:47,025 --> 01:32:49,323
Now. some of us broke them.

1449
01:32:55,333 --> 01:32:57,130
l broke them.

1450
01:33:03,408 --> 01:33:07,401

1464
01:35:05,129 --> 01:35:08,621
You know. 900 million Chinamen
couldn't give a damn.

1465
01:35:08,833 --> 01:35:10,926
They couldn't care less.

1466
01:35:12,036 --> 01:35:14,436
Not about this press conference.

1467
01:35:16,875 --> 01:35:18,934
But l love basketball.

1468
01:35:19,911 --> 01:35:21,538
l'm a Dolphin and l just love it.

1469
01:35:25,650 --> 01:35:27,982
You know. sometimes the world

1470
01:35:28,186 --> 01:35:30,347
doesn't make
a whole lot of sense to me.

1471
01:35:32,757 --> 01:35:35,055
Except on the basketball court.

1472
01:35:37,195 --> 01:35:40,164
And that's good enough for me.

1473
01:35:41,499 --> 01:35:44,195
- Coach?
- Yeah. Ed.

1474
01:35:44,402 --> 01:35:47,462
l gotta ask this question.
or l wouldn't be doing my job.

1475
01:35:48,106 --> 01:35:50,836
Would you care to comment
on the rumor that you arranged

1476
01:35:51,042 --> 01:35:54,603
for an automobile to be purchased
for Neon Bodeaux?

1477
01:35:57,815 --> 01:35:59,715
You know--

1478
01:36:01,552 --> 01:36:06,489
You know. Ed. you've just gotta get
your mind out of the gutter.

1479
01:36:06,691 --> 01:36:09,285
You know. you just gotta start
thinking straight.

1480
01:36:09,494 --> 01:36:11,587
l mean. it's right there
in front of you.

1481
01:36:11,796 --> 01:36:16,529
For chrissake. it wasn't an automobile.
l mean. it was a fully loaded Lexus.

1482
01:36:19,437 --> 01:36:22,406
The damn car had everything.
lt had everything. didn't it. Happy?

1483
01:36:22,607 --> 01:36:24,734
l mean. that car was fully loaded.
wasn't it?

1484
01:36:24,943 --> 01:36:29,937
No. no. coach. lt was
a nuclear surfboard. remember?

1485
01:36:31,349 --> 01:36:33,283
And the damn thing of it is. Ed. is.

1486
01:36:33,484 --> 01:36:37,011
you know. Neon. he didn't want it.
He didn't want the car.

1487
01:36:37,221 --> 01:36:39,382
He didn't want a-- He didn't ask
for anything. but--

1488
01:36:39,590 --> 01:36:41,490
You know. he wasn't for sale.

1489
01:36:41,693 --> 01:36:44,218
But we got it for him anyway.

1490
01:36:44,429 --> 01:36:46,090
l mean. and l think. personally.

1491
01:36:46,297 --> 01:36:48,663
that it would've been a hell of a deal.
a good price.

1492
01:36:48,866 --> 01:36:51,960
l mean... l mean. what did Neon
do tonight? Does anybody know?

1493
01:36:52,170 --> 01:36:54,468
How many boards
did Neon have tonight?

1494
01:36:54,672 --> 01:36:57,368
- Thirteen.
- Thirteen boards? Well. there you are.

1495
01:36:57,575 --> 01:37:00,043
lt would've been a hell of a deal.
Can you imagine?

1496
01:37:00,244 --> 01:37:01,939
Can you imagine what Neon
would've done

1497
01:37:02,146 --> 01:37:04,876
if we had tried to give him a Ferrari?

1498
01:37:05,083 --> 01:37:09,645
l mean. for chrissake.
he might've scored 40 or 50 points.

1499
01:37:09,854 --> 01:37:13,881
l mean. who knows. Who knows
what he would've done for a Ferrari.

1500
01:37:16,260 --> 01:37:18,592
Now. you know. Neon.

1501
01:37:18,796 --> 01:37:21,959
he didn't take anything.
He didn't want anything.

1502
01:37:22,166 --> 01:37:24,100
But some of the others did.
didn't they. Happy?

1503
01:37:24,435 --> 01:37:27,404
Wasn't there some of the other kids?
What did we give them?

1504
01:37:27,605 --> 01:37:32,838
What. cars? Tractors?
Gave a kid a tractor?

1505
01:37:33,044 --> 01:37:36,411
Another kid we gave a house.
Didn't we give him a house?

1506
01:37:36,614 --> 01:37:39,344
You know. bags of cash.
l don't know what we gave these kids.

1507
01:37:39,550 --> 01:37:42,041
You know. they asked for things.
we gave it to them.

1508
01:37:42,587 --> 01:37:46,580
l mean. you guys asked me to win.
and l gave that to you. Right?

1509
01:37:47,225 --> 01:37:49,523
And the alumni are all jerking off
over this win.

1510
01:37:49,727 --> 01:37:53,060
which is the only time the alumni
ever jerk off. right. is when we win.

1511
01:37:53,464 --> 01:37:56,695
Because this ain't about education!
lt ain't much about winning.

1512
01:37:56,901 --> 01:37:59,495
and it sure as hell ain't
much about basketball!

1513
01:37:59,871 --> 01:38:01,304
lt's about money!

1514
01:38:01,506 --> 01:38:04,236
Just goddamn money!

1515
01:38:06,411 --> 01:38:08,436
That's what it's about. Ed.

1516
01:38:09,347 --> 01:38:11,144
And l bought into it.

1517
01:38:11,349 --> 01:38:13,840
l bought into it bigtime.

1518
01:38:14,052 --> 01:38:15,917
l'm a big part of the problem.

1519
01:38:18,723 --> 01:38:22,386
Stick a fork in this creep.
because he's done! He's dead meat!

1520
01:38:22,593 --> 01:38:26,757
You're finished! You will never coach
in America again. you got that?

1521
01:38:26,964 --> 01:38:28,864
Why don't you try Bulgaria.

1522
01:38:29,067 --> 01:38:31,661
Hear they're looking for wimps
like you! Whiners!

1523
01:38:31,869 --> 01:38:33,928
- Give it a rest.
- No. goddamn it!

1524
01:38:34,138 --> 01:38:36,971
Get your hands off me! l can walk!

1525
01:38:37,175 --> 01:38:41,771
Loser! You lost three years in a row!
Gave you everything you wanted!

1526
01:38:41,979 --> 01:38:44,106
There goes Happy.
heading for the cash machine.

1527
01:38:44,682 --> 01:38:47,344
Oh. yeah. he's gonna get himself
a middle linebacker.

1528
01:38:47,552 --> 01:38:50,749
That guy's got the best players
money can buy!

1529
01:38:51,355 --> 01:38:54,449
The best players money can buy!

1530
01:38:57,895 --> 01:39:00,762
You know. l'll tell you
something else.

1531
01:39:02,433 --> 01:39:04,333
You know. someplace--

1532
01:39:04,535 --> 01:39:08,403
Someplace in America right now.
there's some 1 0-year-old kid.

1533
01:39:08,606 --> 01:39:10,870
He's out there on that playground.

1534
01:39:11,075 --> 01:39:13,509
And he's playing.
He's dribbling between his legs.

1535
01:39:13,711 --> 01:39:16,179
He's going left. he's going right.

1536
01:39:16,380 --> 01:39:20,316
He's already above the rim.
he's stuffing it home.

1537
01:39:20,518 --> 01:39:23,453
You know what's gonna happen to
this kid? Five minutes from now.

1538
01:39:23,654 --> 01:39:28,819
he's gonna be surrounded by agents
and corporate sponsors and coaches.

1539
01:39:29,026 --> 01:39:31,517
l mean. people like me
just drooling over this kid

1540
01:39:31,729 --> 01:39:34,755
because he holds our future
employment in his hands.

1541
01:39:37,602 --> 01:39:40,002
l mean. that's what we've made
this game.

1542
01:39:41,906 --> 01:39:44,033
That's what we've done.

1543
01:39:46,511 --> 01:39:48,570
You know. the best coaching job
l ever did.

1544
01:39:48,779 --> 01:39:51,646
that wasn't tonight.
lt was last season.

1545
01:39:51,849 --> 01:39:55,307
You know. when we were 1 4 and 1 5.
We had a losing season.

1546
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:58,455
But goddamn it. those kids.
they gave me their heart!

1547
01:39:58,656 --> 01:40:00,146
They gave me everything they had!

1548
01:40:00,358 --> 01:40:03,259
They played up to the maximum
of their ability!

1549
01:40:03,461 --> 01:40:05,429
They gave it everything!

1550
01:40:05,630 --> 01:40:08,793
And. you know. it wasn't good enough.
Wasn't good enough for me.

1551
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:12,902
Wasn't good enough for you.
Wasn't good enough for anybody!

1552
01:40:17,074 --> 01:40:19,065
That's pathetic.

1553
01:40:20,978 --> 01:40:23,071
l mean. it's really pathetic.

1554
01:40:27,084 --> 01:40:29,780
l've become what l despise.

1555
01:40:34,458 --> 01:40:36,585
l cheated my profession.

1556
01:40:38,362 --> 01:40:40,353
Cheated myself.

1557
01:40:42,967 --> 01:40:44,730
l cheated basketball.

1558
01:40:48,606 --> 01:40:52,406
There's two words l didn't think
would ever come out of my mouth.

1559
01:40:53,110 --> 01:40:56,375
l didn't think l'd ever be able
to say them.

1560
01:41:03,921 --> 01:41:05,047
l quit.

1561
01:41:06,324 --> 01:41:07,757
Oh. my God.

1562
01:41:23,407 --> 01:41:25,432
To our coach!

1563
01:41:25,643 --> 01:41:27,975
Great game. Coach Bell!

1564
01:41:54,171 --> 01:41:56,264
Come on. pass the ball.

1565
01:41:57,208 --> 01:41:59,176
Come on.

1566
01:42:02,380 --> 01:42:04,007
Cover him.

1567
01:42:04,215 --> 01:42:06,649
Pass it. l'm open.

1568
01:42:06,851 --> 01:42:08,876
That's how you do it.

1569
01:42:09,987 --> 01:42:11,477
Come on. right here.

1570
01:42:11,689 --> 01:42:13,680
Go in. go in. You got it.
Take the shot.

1571
01:42:13,891 --> 01:42:15,358
- Watch this.
- Yes!

1572
01:42:15,559 --> 01:42:16,890
Yeah!

1573
01:42:18,062 --> 01:42:19,791
Come on.

1574
01:42:23,100 --> 01:42:24,465
Stop him.

1575
01:42:25,469 --> 01:42:27,528
What are you doing?

1576
01:42:29,707 --> 01:42:30,935
Pass it.

1577
01:42:31,142 --> 01:42:33,508
Son. throw me the ball.
Throw me the ball. Come here.

1578
01:42:33,711 --> 01:42:36,339
Come here a second. Give me the ball.
Give me the ball.

1579
01:42:36,547 --> 01:42:39,448
Son. look. Come here. listen.

1580
01:42:39,650 --> 01:42:42,915
You're too good a basketball player
to shoot that two-handed jump shot.

1581
01:42:43,120 --> 01:42:46,112
You know. has anybody told you how
the mechanics of a jump shot go?

1582
01:42:46,324 --> 01:42:47,951
- No.
- Let me tell you something.

1583
01:42:48,426 --> 01:42:50,417
You know. when you go up
for your jump shot.

1584
01:42:50,628 --> 01:42:52,687
get your shooting hand
behind the ball.

1585
01:42:52,897 --> 01:42:56,458
Get that behind the ball. Get your other
hand right along the side of it. right?

1586
01:42:56,667 --> 01:43:00,034
And when you go up-- And then
release the ball and follow through.

1587
01:43:00,237 --> 01:43:03,832
Drop that arm down.
Now. look. get your legs into the shot.

1588
01:43:04,041 --> 01:43:05,565
That's a way. That's it. That's it.

1589
01:43:05,776 --> 01:43:09,109
All right. now. son. let me see you.
Let me see you fake left. go right.

1590
01:43:09,313 --> 01:43:11,873
out to the top of the key
and take a shot. Okay.

1591
01:43:12,083 --> 01:43:13,914
That's it.

1592
01:43:15,519 --> 01:43:19,011
That's a boy. Let's play a little game.
Come on. guys. Take it out. Let's go.

1593
01:43:21,759 --> 01:43:24,489
All right. get loose. Let's go.
All right. move the ball. Move the ball.

1594
01:43:24,695 --> 01:43:26,720
Move without the ball.
