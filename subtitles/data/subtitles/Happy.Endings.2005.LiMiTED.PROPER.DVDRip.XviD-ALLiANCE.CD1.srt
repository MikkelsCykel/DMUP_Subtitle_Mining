00:00:26,393 --> 00:00:27,553
Wait!

2
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:32,891
Wait!

3
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:48,472
My God! Oh, my God!

4
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:49,913
Oh, my God!

5
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:51,575
Oh, God! Oh, my God!

6
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:54,085
- I didn't see her! I didn't see her!
- Oh, my God!

7
00:00:54,154 --> 00:00:55,985
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry!
I didn't see her!

8
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:58,354
Do you have a cell?! Call 911!

9
00:00:58,425 --> 00:00:59,722
Oh, God!

10
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:06,828
Hey, is she all right?

11
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,128
I don't know!

12
00:01:08,201 --> 00:01:11,364
911? Yes, hurry,
we need an ambulance quick.

13
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:00,719
My tapes.

14
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:21,699
Sorry.

15
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:35,784
This is cool, isn't it?

16
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:49,632
I, uh... I ran with scissors.

17
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:53,001
Seriously. I was six.

18
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:05,249
We're not related, you know.

19
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:06,785
Not really.

20
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,987
Pregnant? Pregnant?!

21
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:17,830
Get your bony fucking ass
out of this car!

22
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:19,990
What the hell
is the matter with you?!

23
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:22,364
What the fuck were you...

24
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:31,968
I gotta go.

25
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,945
Wait...

26
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:37,313
Wear this when they do it.

27
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:39,908
It's... it's good luck.

28
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:41,351
Mamie? Who's in there?

29
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:43,355
No one, Mom. I'm on the phone.

30
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:45,323
Charles is waiting in the car,
so hurry up.

31
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,655
OK, I'm coming.

32
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:51,363
I've got your blue bag.

33
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:58,837
I only did it
to get out of this house. OK?

34
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,338
No, you didn't.

35
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:04,137
Mamie! It's time to go!

36
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:27,899
- Hello.
- Hello.

37
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:30,595
I'm Mamie Toll. I have an 11:00.

38
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,698
A one-hour is 75, right?

39
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,639
That's right.

40
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:38,802
I'm gonna tip her now...

41
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:41,346
so if you would please
just tell her beforehand.

42
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:42,711
What's her name?

43
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:46,377
I'm sorry,
I have you down for Javier.

44
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:48,317
Do you prefer a woman?

45
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:50,515
No, it's fine.

46
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:54,720
That's fine. Can you make a note,
though, for next time?

47
00:04:55,995 --> 00:04:56,984
Thank you.

48
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:17,042
OK, I'm ready.

49
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:24,784
Hello. I'm Javier.

50
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:26,882
Hi, I'm Mamie.

51
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:30,962
Have you had massages often?

52
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:34,864
Not really.
I've had them before, but...

53
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:37,266
What place hurts you?

54
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:40,033
My lower back, a little.
Right there.

55
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:41,698
OK.

56
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:43,674
OK, turn over.

57
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:46,541
I'll lift the top sheet for you.

58
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:47,670
What?

59
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:50,648
Better if we finish with the back.

60
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:52,878
Oh. Of course, yeah.

61
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:56,547
Makes sense. OK.

62
00:05:56,622 --> 00:05:58,749
OK. Yeah.

63
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:02,994
Put your hands
at your side, please.

64
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:04,324
Relax them.

65
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:05,489
Oh, sorry, yeah.

66
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:08,591
Everyone does it
different... differently.

67
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:10,499
I'm Javier.
Did I say that already?

68
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:11,832
Or Javi?

69
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:14,600
Yes, Javier. Yeah, you said it.

70
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:21,802
- OK?
- Yeah.

71
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,549
OK, lifting your leg.

72
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:29,247
Just let it be loose, OK?

73
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:31,916
This is for your lower back,
to stretch.

74
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:33,253
Uh-huh.

75
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:35,419
Bend your knee.

76
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:38,760
Good. Good.
And I push, OK?

77
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:40,128
Uh-huh.

78
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:43,264
OK.

79
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:46,203
Do not bring your shoulders up.
Let them fall down.

80
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:49,764
- OK.
- Let them fall down.

81
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:52,106
Let them go.

82
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:53,270
Yeah.

83
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:55,109
OK.

84
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:57,046
Let 'em go.

85
00:06:57,116 --> 00:06:58,845
What are you doing?

86
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,045
They can hear us.

87
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,055
Wh-what are you...

88
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:06,717
Get... OK, get off me.
Are you crazy?

89
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:07,885
- Shh!
- Don't!

90
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,555
This is what you need.
This is why you've paid.

91
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:14,099
Well, it was...
it was a gift certificate.

92
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:17,269
Oh, shit!

93
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:23,506
A gift certificate?
You would say that?

94
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:26,568
I just wanted to be specific.
You know, a lot of details.

95
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:28,671
I told you I couldn't
pull this off, I can't...

96
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:30,215
You're not a good liar.

97
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,444
- No.
- This is good.

98
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:34,452
Well, you're not so hot, OK?

99
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,454
With the, you know,
"This is what you need."

100
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:37,716
That was a little much.

101
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,621
You know what I was going to say?
I was going to say...

102
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:42,889
"Trust my hands,
trust my fingers."

103
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,390
I don't want to get you fired.

104
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:51,426
I agree. 100 percentage.

105
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:53,631
They can hear.

106
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:58,769
Muu...

107
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:01,040
Mucous. Mucous.

108
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:02,546
- Mu-cous.
- Yeah.

109
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:06,551
Muc-cous.
Muc... Ah. Muc-ous.

110
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:09,247
Mem-bran-ee?

111
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,653
- Membranes.
- Mem-bran-ees?

112
00:08:10,723 --> 00:08:12,691
- Membranes.
- Mem-bran-ees sound better, no?

113
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,263
But it...

114
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,773
it already has a face, right?

115
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,809
A face and a personality?

116
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:34,813
It has more of a head
than a face at this stage.

117
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:37,907
And a personality?
I don't... Not a personality.

118
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:40,475
I don't think you could say that.

119
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:42,612
No one's giving me any advice.

120
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:46,283
I'm not here for advice.
I'm here to listen.

121
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,623
I can't tell you what to do.

122
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:51,663
That's great. That's helpful.

123
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:02,005
I had one when I was your age.

124
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:06,511
And were you sorry after?

125
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:09,412
I mean, does it bother you?

126
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:10,813
I'm Catholic.

127
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,817
I shouldn't have told you that.

128
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:15,046
And I'm Jewish, so...

129
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:17,248
I shouldn't have
told you that, either.

130
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,752
Will you be here tomorrow?

131
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:25,660
It's tomorrow at 10:00 if I decide.

132
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:28,996
Tomorrow? No. No,
but there will be someone for you...

133
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:32,435
Janet, if you want
to talk afterwards.

134
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,509
Yeah. I'm gonna do it.

135
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,909
OK.

136
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:41,742
I'm not maternal, either.

137
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,060
Thank you.

138
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:14,742
It's 7:00.
I guess you're on your way.

139
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:16,873
It's tonight, you know,
in case you're checking.

140
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,075
- Fuck!
- Call me.

141
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,549
Fuck!

142
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:23,953
Hi. Yeah, Charley Peppitone, please.
It's his sister.

143
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:28,826
Hey, it's me.

144
00:10:28,894 --> 00:10:32,887
Hi. Listen,
I'm... I'm too tired to come over.

145
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:36,298
Well, Charley, he's two!

146
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:39,896
And... No, he's not gonna...
He doesn't even know me.

147
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:43,567
I didn't get a present,
and Pam and Diane don't care.

148
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,806
- They don't even like me.
- They do like you.

149
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:51,077
Come on... What?
You don't have to worry about that.

150
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:54,085
No... Listen... No, Gil has, like,
a bunch of presents...

151
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,951
and he can just,
like, put your name on one...

152
00:10:57,023 --> 00:10:59,924
and then it'll be great,
you know?

153
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:04,429
OK, wait, wait, wait.
Mamie? Hello?

154
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:05,964
Shit.

155
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,315
Yeah!

156
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:32,186
Happy birth...

157
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:33,691
That makes him cry.

158
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,557
Yeah, but the cake is great,
and the candles... love that.

159
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:38,392
Can he blow 'em out?

160
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:39,556
Yeah, you wanna
blow 'em out, baby?

161
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:40,860
We'll do it.

162
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:43,367
- Everybody do it together.
- Blow towards Mommy.

163
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:47,736
One, two, three, blow!

164
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:54,112
I hated that song, too.
I never knew where to look.

165
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,545
And how long
can you stare at candles?

166
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:59,778
Just cake, no icing,
'cause we don't do sugar for him.

167
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:02,343
I thought the whole point
of being a kid was candy.

168
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:05,254
Not anymore.

169
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:07,986
Could we just have dogs?

170
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,085
Oh, come on.
You would have been a great dad.

171
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:11,720
Aw, thanks.

172
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:14,357
We tried. It wasn't meant to be.

173
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:18,130
- Besides, being an uncle's better.
- Yeah.

174
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:22,698
So strong!

175
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,874
There you go.

176
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:51,435
Your cousin bites.

177
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:54,803
She doesn't. She's really good.

178
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:57,138
You think she bites?

179
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:59,404
Her husband's cute.

180
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,910
He totally is staring at your tits.

181
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:07,043
That's why I've got two weeks
to find somewhere else to stay.

182
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:11,585
Well, I wish you hadn't
slept with Rick back then...

183
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:13,147
otherwise, you know...

184
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:15,193
I know. I'm fine. I'm fine.
Sorry, sorry.

185
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:16,250
It's OK.

186
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:18,853
I'm gonna find somewhere.
It's cool. It's taken care of.

187
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:23,331
OK!

188
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:32,870
OK, next up, we have Jude!

189
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:34,970
Jude?

190
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:36,309
Jude? What did you do?

191
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:38,942
- Jude here?
- It's funny, 'cause she's right here.

192
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:40,986
You are such a jackass!

193
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:46,281
- That was great.
- Thanks.

194
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,257
OK...

195
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:53,321
Are you fucking serious?

196
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,526
That isn't what you picked?

197
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:58,866
No, no, that's what I picked.

198
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:03,235
OK.

199
00:14:04,643 --> 00:14:08,170
This song is for someone
who's here tonight.

200
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:19,290
If you search for tenderness

201
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:22,759
It isn't hard to find

202
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:27,322
You can have the love
you need to live...

203
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:29,594
Little low.

204
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:32,603
If you look for truthfulness

205
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:36,767
You might just as well be blind

206
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:43,611
It always seems to be
so hard to give

207
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:47,277
Honesty

208
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:50,754
It's such a lonely word

209
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:56,853
Everyone is so untrue

210
00:14:58,197 --> 00:15:01,564
Honesty

211
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:05,001
Is hardly ever heard

212
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:11,441
It's mostly what I need from you

213
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:19,639
I can find a lover

214
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:22,983
I can find a friend

215
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:30,154
I can have security
until the bitter end

216
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:36,259
Anyone can comfort me
with promises again

217
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:38,235
I know

218
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:46,204
I know

219
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:00,352
- Hey, Jude?
- Oh, fuck off.

220
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:03,054
What? Oh, it's not that.

221
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:08,961
I've got this band. Serpentine?

222
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:11,832
Oh, have you ever heard of us?

223
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:12,962
No.

224
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:16,201
Anyway, Rain, our singer...

225
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:18,869
she got sent to rehab.

226
00:16:18,944 --> 00:16:20,468
So I was thinking...

227
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,610
Hey, Otis! What's up?

228
00:16:25,684 --> 00:16:28,744
Oh, can I borrow this?

229
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,346
We watched it last week, right?

230
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:34,722
Yeah, but I want to listen
to the commentary.

231
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:36,886
You want to?

232
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:40,056
Uh, I gotta get home.

233
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:43,260
Yeah, I saw your... Gil.

234
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:48,463
- Hey, the baby's cute.
- Yeah.

235
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:53,441
Who would you say
he looked like?

236
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:57,949
Shit, I don't know.
What's the name of the pretty one?

237
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,042
Diane. No, no, no.
A guy, you know?

238
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:01,984
You know, if you had to say
a guy he looked like.

239
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:03,612
I didn't really see him.

240
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:06,886
He's a baby,
you know, cute, you know.

241
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,792
That's all I meant.
Like, puppies and shit.

242
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,531
- I'll see you Thursday.
- Yeah, sure.

243
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:20,231
Serpentine's playing?

244
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:22,705
OK. See ya.

245
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:45,292
Otis? Is that you?

246
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,482
Did you leave this at my house?

247
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:33,694
"Does 5/13/85
mean anything to you?

248
00:20:33,765 --> 00:20:35,426
"If so, meet me at
Cahuenga Grounds at 11:00."

249
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,333
It's a little dramatic.
I'm sorry. I'm Nicky.

250
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:39,665
What is this about?

251
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,676
I don't want you to get
the wrong impression.

252
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:47,007
I'm not a bad guy.

253
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,774
I'm a documentary filmmaker.

254
00:20:48,847 --> 00:20:53,716
And I have a proposal for you.
Strictly legitimate.

255
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,020
What do you know about this date?

256
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:04,153
You had a kid on that day.
Somewhere in Phoenix.

257
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:06,595
Tell me I have that wrong.

258
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:10,157
Do you want a coffee or anything?
A scone or...

259
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:12,795
I don't... I don't have any children.

260
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:14,532
Well, not legally, yeah.

261
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:16,972
But, I mean, you know,
he's still yours.

262
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:18,942
See... Hey, see?
I know it's a boy.

263
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:21,070
I know everything about him.

264
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:23,580
I know his name,
I know where he lives.

265
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:25,947
He wrote, when he turned 18,
about a year ago...

266
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:28,145
for all that information
that they have to give you.

267
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,518
That's how I got your name.

268
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:32,113
He wants to contact me?

269
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:36,052
Well... no.

270
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:40,497
But they sent him back this file,
which he showed me...

271
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:43,125
and I have in a very safe place.

272
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:44,862
But he didn't want
to go through with it...

273
00:21:44,936 --> 00:21:47,302
'cause he's such a suck-up
to his fake parents.

274
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:50,603
I hate to tell you,
he's really kind of a pussy.

275
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:52,166
Who are you?

276
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:57,147
I'm a friend.
I'm like a mentor... guy.

277
00:21:57,215 --> 00:22:01,117
He went to my high school
six years after me.

278
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:03,518
Do you want to find him?
Because I can tell you how...

279
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:05,852
on one condition...

280
00:22:05,924 --> 00:22:08,916
which is...

281
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:11,963
you let me film the whole thing...
you finding your kid.

282
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,657
See, I need to get into AFI.

283
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:16,257
Do you know AFI?
AFI is American Film Institute.

284
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,734
So, they have scholarships.

285
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:20,397
Well, they have, like,
one scholarship a year...

286
00:22:20,472 --> 00:22:22,440
so I need a killer film.

287
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:26,307
A documentary,
like you finding your kid.

288
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:27,640
I don't believe this.

289
00:22:27,713 --> 00:22:28,907
OK, yeah.
We'd have to fake parts of it.

290
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:32,711
Sure, we would.
But the emotion would be true.

291
00:22:32,784 --> 00:22:34,615
Your guilt and stuff...

292
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:37,382
that would be our selling point.

293
00:22:37,456 --> 00:22:40,823
I am so glad
that you're not a dog.

294
00:22:40,892 --> 00:22:43,759
I mean, you know,
even if the story is great...

295
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:45,626
people want to look at
good-looking people.

296
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:47,130
You know,
all things being equal.

297
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:49,360
So, huge relief
when I saw you, you know?

298
00:22:49,434 --> 00:22:52,961
And I can make you look better.
That's lighting.

299
00:22:54,072 --> 00:22:56,632
I don't need to see my son.

300
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:59,336
I was going to have
an abortion, in fact...

301
00:22:59,411 --> 00:23:02,574
until someone talked me out it.

302
00:23:02,647 --> 00:23:06,310
If you don't care, then why'd you keep
updating the adoption agency...

303
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:07,716
with your addresses?

304
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:09,515
There's four of them in the file.

305
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:16,116
He has the information.
He can contact me if he wants to.

306
00:23:16,194 --> 00:23:18,355
He won't. He threw it away.

307
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:20,864
The whole file.
That's how I got it.

308
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:26,261
If it wasn't for me, you'd go
to your grave without ever seeing him.

309
00:23:27,372 --> 00:23:29,704
You can keep that.
I have the original.

310
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:31,606
I needed to reshoot finding it
for the movie.

311
00:23:31,676 --> 00:23:32,973
There's other stuff, too.

312
00:23:33,044 --> 00:23:35,035
There's other stuff like this
that I can...

313
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:38,514
Anyway, just... say yes.

314
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,551
I mean, it's win-win here.

315
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,745
This is a human being
you're talking about.

316
00:23:44,823 --> 00:23:48,020
Yeah! Who you gave away, OK?

317
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,721
I mean, come on,
don't... don't be like that.

318
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:54,391
Look, I know that this is
one of those big ideas...

319
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:57,697
but it's really just better
if you just say yes to the movie...

320
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:02,035
because otherwise, I have to
charge you 25K just for the info.

321
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:03,665
That's what they want
at AFI for a year.

322
00:24:03,742 --> 00:24:07,109
OK, you tell me where my son is
or I'm going to the police.

323
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:09,238
In fact, no, I'm going to go
to the police anyway...

324
00:24:09,314 --> 00:24:10,906
you miserable jackass!

325
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:12,711
And I'm gonna press
every charge they come up with.

326
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:14,718
How's that for a big idea?

327
00:24:17,556 --> 00:24:18,750
Fuck.

328
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,217
Fuck!

329
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:24,888
God damn it! You know...

330
00:24:26,898 --> 00:24:29,696
what I didn't figure
is that you wouldn't care.

331
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:32,999
Which you don't. You haven't
even asked me his first name.

332
00:24:33,071 --> 00:24:35,801
I was gonna throw you that bone.
But you know what? Fuck you!

333
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:37,569
No, no, no,
you can tell me his first name.

334
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:39,269
No, you blew it.

335
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:31,059
Wow, you look... different.

336
00:25:32,664 --> 00:25:35,792
Well, yeah,
it was a long time ago, OK?

337
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:37,801
What'd you look like back then?

338
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:40,303
I don't... Forget it.

339
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:42,431
Listen, do you know
who the father is?

340
00:25:42,507 --> 00:25:44,941
Because if you say no,
maybe this guy will go to him.

341
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:46,637
No. Father unknown.

342
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:49,737
I mean, of course,
I know who the father was...

343
00:25:49,814 --> 00:25:52,305
but that's what
I put down on the forms.

344
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,978
And the father's dead.
Plane crash.

345
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:56,987
And you don't have 25,000?

346
00:25:57,055 --> 00:26:00,218
No, I can barely pay the first
and second on the house!

347
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:01,418
How can I...

348
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:03,927
What about your family?

349
00:26:03,995 --> 00:26:06,691
No, none of them
know about the baby.

350
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:08,892
Except my dad. He's dead, too.

351
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:12,562
You know a lot of dead people.

352
00:26:12,637 --> 00:26:14,605
Well, it happens.

353
00:26:14,673 --> 00:26:16,664
It's creepy.

354
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:20,177
I'm young,
and I don't even care

355
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:22,645
How lucky am I?

356
00:26:22,714 --> 00:26:26,514
I'm young,
with a few bucks to spare

357
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:29,019
And I don't even try

358
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:32,420
I know it's all in my mind

359
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:34,885
How lucky am I?

360
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:38,585
How lucky am I?

361
00:26:49,341 --> 00:26:51,036
OK, that was awesome!

362
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:53,907
You sounded just like Rain,
and she was good.

363
00:26:53,979 --> 00:26:56,209
Really? 'Cause her tape sucks.

364
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:59,444
Can you slur and then have
your forehead hit the mike?

365
00:26:59,517 --> 00:27:01,007
That was, like, her signature.

366
00:27:01,086 --> 00:27:03,213
Hey, Miles, let's get this
in the van for tomorrow.

367
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:06,780
God, I don't know
what to do with this song!

368
00:27:06,858 --> 00:27:10,487
We could slow it down maybe.

369
00:27:10,562 --> 00:27:12,291
Go slow?

370
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:15,964
Hey, do you guys mind
if I ask you something?

371
00:27:16,034 --> 00:27:17,661
She's not in rehab for drugs.

372
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:20,136
It's just booze.
Plus, she's a vomiter.

373
00:27:20,205 --> 00:27:22,435
A fat vomiter,
which is fucking useless.

374
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:24,407
No...

375
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:27,309
just, why is Otis the leader?

376
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:30,473
I could drum better than him
and his backup vocals suck.

377
00:27:30,548 --> 00:27:31,776
Look around.

378
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:33,818
Yeah, he's an untalented
little faggot...

379
00:27:33,885 --> 00:27:35,648
but he's a rich,
untalented little faggot.

380
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,518
His dad owns Linux Hills Mall.
Or, like, most of it.

381
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:39,887
And he knows
every club owner in town.

382
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:41,186
You think we could buy
this stuff on our own?

383
00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:42,851
- He's like Bill Gates.
- That makes sense.

384
00:27:42,927 --> 00:27:44,792
For now.
Until Pappy finds out...

385
00:27:44,863 --> 00:27:47,798
his kid's a pickle smoker,
then we're history.

386
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:49,697
He's already got his suspicions.

387
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:51,463
He's gay?

388
00:27:51,536 --> 00:27:54,437
Total cocksmooch.
He'll deny it, but...

389
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,633
He's not gay. He just...
He looks gay.

390
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:59,108
Dude, you won't even
take a piss with him.

391
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:01,543
Hey, there's beer, too, guys.

392
00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:05,114
Why do you think he's a drummer?

393
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:07,743
So he can stare
at our asses all night.

394
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:15,022
- That's him.
- Sure?

395
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:16,458
OK, yeah.

396
00:28:18,163 --> 00:28:19,687
Hurry.

397
00:28:19,764 --> 00:28:20,992
Hurry. Here.

398
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,726
Oh, God.

399
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:27,865
OK.

400
00:28:27,939 --> 00:28:30,339
Not a good wiper.

401
00:28:30,408 --> 00:28:32,273
What kind of movies
does this guy make?

402
00:28:32,343 --> 00:28:34,174
I don't know. He's an idiot.

403
00:28:34,245 --> 00:28:36,907
The kind idiots make, I guess.

404
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:40,075
All right,
we're looking for a file, OK?

405
00:28:40,151 --> 00:28:42,381
Don't mess anything up,
if you can.

406
00:28:42,454 --> 00:28:44,684
Not that he'd notice.

407
00:28:46,257 --> 00:28:48,225
Yeah, check the duffel bag.

408
00:28:49,828 --> 00:28:51,659
What if it's in his car?

409
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:52,856
Javi.

410
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:01,429
OK. This is...

411
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:03,997
This is the form I signed.

412
00:29:05,643 --> 00:29:09,170
I left this with them,
to go with the baby.

413
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,151
Who's Miriam?

414
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:19,452
Me. Is there anything else,
anywhere?

415
00:29:19,524 --> 00:29:21,458
Did you see a file?

416
00:29:22,894 --> 00:29:24,361
There's no name.

417
00:29:28,233 --> 00:29:29,495
Mamie, we'd better go.

418
00:29:29,567 --> 00:29:32,434
Hey, wait, wait, wait.
Is that sentimental?

419
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:35,029
Not really.

420
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:37,267
Let's trade.
He'll never know the difference.

421
00:29:38,576 --> 00:29:39,600
Thank you.

422
00:29:42,313 --> 00:29:45,476
Whoa! What the fuck is this?

423
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:47,643
- No, no!
- What are you doing here?

424
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:49,778
It's OK.
I followed you today. It's OK.

425
00:29:49,854 --> 00:29:52,823
You think you're gonna
beat it out of me? I can't believe you!

426
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:55,155
My God, Nicky, no.
It's nothing like that, no.

427
00:29:55,226 --> 00:29:56,716
What's he doing here, then?

428
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:02,829
He's your new documentary.

429
00:30:04,402 --> 00:30:06,165
OK? Javier, this is Nicky...

430
00:30:06,237 --> 00:30:08,637
the director
I was telling you about.

431
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:14,804
He's an immigrant, OK?
From Mexico. And...

432
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:18,406
he was in gangs.
They had gangs there, all right?

433
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:20,451
And he crossed the border...

434
00:30:20,518 --> 00:30:25,387
so that he could put his life
back together in the States.

435
00:30:25,456 --> 00:30:27,981
It's the American dream.

436
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:30,857
OK? It's good.

437
00:30:32,363 --> 00:30:34,194
Is that it?

438
00:30:34,265 --> 00:30:36,699
That sucks!
You think that's as good...

439
00:30:36,768 --> 00:30:39,259
as a mother finding the kid
she ditched?

440
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:41,305
All right, well,
if you're not interested in that...

441
00:30:41,372 --> 00:30:44,705
No, I'm not interested, OK?
We're done.

442
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:47,801
I can get into AFI some other way.

443
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:49,642
I can shoot...

444
00:30:49,714 --> 00:30:52,376
me getting into AFI.
That'd be a good...

445
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:55,248
- Just get the fuck out of here.
- All right, all right, we'll go.

446
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,584
So... But we'll work out
another deal.

447
00:30:57,655 --> 00:30:59,987
No, you've got nothing to offer.
I got nothing to sell.

448
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:01,650
It's cool, man, OK? We get it.

449
00:31:01,726 --> 00:31:05,389
OK? We couldn't think
of anything better, but you're right.

450
00:31:05,463 --> 00:31:09,559
Who wants to see a movie
about a sex worker?

451
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:11,363
What?

452
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:14,667
A sex worker. That's what I do.

453
00:31:14,739 --> 00:31:18,072
Massage, the works, you know?

454
00:31:18,142 --> 00:31:20,542
For these rich
Beverly Hills ladies?

455
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:23,410
But you know what? Sex...

456
00:31:23,481 --> 00:31:26,006
No, sex shouldn't be in
a serious movie. Come on, Mamie.

457
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:28,518
No, whoa, whoa. If it's...

458
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:33,421
necessary to the story, then...

459
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:36,426
What are we doing?
Now we're helping him?

460
00:31:36,494 --> 00:31:38,985
You want to know
where your son is, right?

461
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:41,463
How hard could it be?
We do a couple interviews...

462
00:31:41,532 --> 00:31:43,693
we put it all on the computer.

463
00:31:43,768 --> 00:31:45,258
Right? The tapes, everything?

464
00:31:45,336 --> 00:31:47,566
He gives us the name,
and we give him the movie.

465
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:49,072
Yeah. Well, you heard him, though.

466
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:51,370
He wants to shoot you
doing the sex stuff.

467
00:31:51,442 --> 00:31:56,106
So we fake it. It'll be pretend.
You can be there to see.

468
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:58,876
Look, you're the boss.
I'm just the star.

469
00:32:00,685 --> 00:32:03,313
Have you done that?
That kind of massage?

470
00:32:03,388 --> 00:32:06,755
Happy ending? The full release?

471
00:32:06,824 --> 00:32:08,917
Yeah. One time.

472
00:32:08,993 --> 00:32:10,392
With you last week.

473
00:32:10,461 --> 00:32:11,985
Nah. That was just a goof.

474
00:32:12,063 --> 00:32:15,226
So is this. But at the end of it,
you're going to know who your son is.

475
00:32:16,734 --> 00:32:18,702
Happy endings.

476
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:21,967
You know, that'd be a good title
for his movie.

477
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,531
You should tell him that.
It could be your idea.

478
00:32:40,925 --> 00:32:42,790
Oh, well. It's late.

479
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:46,261
The lady from Mexico said
I could take some of this home.

480
00:32:46,331 --> 00:32:48,458
- She went to bed.
- Guatemala.

481
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:50,660
Really? She didn't tell me her name.

482
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:56,202
My cousin is charging me rent,
and she's got all her food labeled.

483
00:32:56,274 --> 00:32:59,437
She said it's so that her boyfriend has
what he wants when he comes home.

484
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:03,276
Oh, shit! There were subs left?
Do you mind?

485
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,283
Aw, yes!

486
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:16,189
Yeah, the thing is,
you need a day job.

487
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:19,855
We just get meals sometimes.
Couple bucks.

488
00:33:19,931 --> 00:33:21,398
I told you that.

489
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,862
You always been rich?

490
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:26,802
I'm not rich. It's all relative.

491
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:29,533
That's what rich people
always say.

492
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:37,345
- Give me a tour.
- Oh, shit.

493
00:33:38,616 --> 00:33:41,642
Just a real quick one.

494
00:33:44,288 --> 00:33:45,550
Is this the African room?

495
00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:48,922
No, those are...
those are from Indonesia.

496
00:33:48,993 --> 00:33:50,392
Come on, tour me.

497
00:33:50,461 --> 00:33:53,123
My dad's college roommate's.

498
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:56,530
- He's taking off his pants.
- I know.

499
00:33:58,169 --> 00:34:02,105
These are some sculpturey things.

500
00:34:02,173 --> 00:34:03,299
Where did...

501
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,272
Hey, don't!

502
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:12,278
It's freezing outside.
Your pool is so warm!

503
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:13,510
I know.

504
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,617
Oh, nice.

505
00:34:18,856 --> 00:34:20,653
I just got this.

506
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:23,694
We're on this website
for new bands.

507
00:34:25,763 --> 00:34:29,893
- What are you doing?
- I gotta spend the night, OK?

508
00:34:29,967 --> 00:34:32,299
I just need a break.
I'm a little buzzed.

509
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:33,803
I don't know. I... 

510
00:34:33,871 --> 00:34:36,499
Oh, just friends. Come on.

511
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:39,168
You're cute, but I don't know.

512
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:41,370
Have you ever slept
with a girl before?

513
00:34:41,446 --> 00:34:45,007
OK, duh, I'm 22.

514
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,710
I can drive you home.

515
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:03,762
Look...

516
00:35:03,835 --> 00:35:06,770
I really want to spend the night.

517
00:35:06,838 --> 00:35:09,033
I figure you should get
something out of it, too.

518
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:12,804
- But I've got a girlfriend.
- Otis, come on.

519
00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:15,072
You should try it.

520
00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:17,614
You might not be
who you think you are.

521
00:35:27,191 --> 00:35:28,818
You can leave your watch on.

522
00:35:37,001 --> 00:35:39,026
Oh, I don't have a condom.

523
00:35:39,103 --> 00:35:41,867
Have you ever had sex
with anybody before?

524
00:35:43,941 --> 00:35:45,704
Not exactly.

525
00:35:45,776 --> 00:35:47,641
So you don't need one.

526
00:35:47,712 --> 00:35:48,838
Here.

527
00:35:54,218 --> 00:35:55,344
OK.

528
00:35:56,554 --> 00:35:59,022
I'm sorry.
I'm a little distracted.

529
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:01,024
Oh, the tits. Right?

530
00:36:01,092 --> 00:36:02,491
Here.

531
00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:07,156
Is that better?

532
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:13,629
Yeah.

533
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:14,264
- Good morning, Mr. Frank.
- Hey.

534
00:37:14,332 --> 00:37:17,631
- Let me get this.
- No, I got it, I got it.

535
00:37:17,702 --> 00:37:19,932
Their band played here.

536
00:37:20,004 --> 00:37:21,301
All right.

537
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:51,168
Oh, hello. Are you the dad?

538
00:37:51,235 --> 00:37:53,260
What?

539
00:37:53,337 --> 00:37:55,430
Are you the dad?

540
00:37:55,506 --> 00:37:58,236
Yeah. I'm Frank.

541
00:37:58,309 --> 00:38:00,743
I'm Jude. I'm with Otis.

542
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:01,835
OK.

543
00:38:03,347 --> 00:38:04,871
See ya.

544
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,075
Yeah.

545
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:14,616
Your dad's home.

546
00:38:15,826 --> 00:38:18,317
Oh, shit! He's early.

547
00:38:18,396 --> 00:38:20,728
You totally owe me, dude.

548
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:22,493
He does not think
you're a 'mo anymore.

549
00:38:22,566 --> 00:38:25,535
Hey, I am not gay.

550
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:26,729
Hello?

551
00:38:30,374 --> 00:38:31,864
You hello.

552
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:56,664
- Hey, Otis.
- Hey.

553
00:38:56,734 --> 00:38:57,826
Nice girl.

554
00:38:57,902 --> 00:38:59,995
Yeah, she's in the band now.

555
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:02,369
OK. Listen...

556
00:39:03,874 --> 00:39:06,308
don't make Dignora
wash the sheets, OK?

557
00:39:06,377 --> 00:39:09,778
She's like your mother.

558
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:26,091
OK, Gil.
I have something to tell you.

559
00:39:26,163 --> 00:39:28,723
But before I do,
you have to promise me...

560
00:39:28,799 --> 00:39:30,960
that I'm the boss of this, OK?

561
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,468
What?

562
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:36,734
OK, I've discovered something,
which I don't have to tell you...

563
00:39:36,807 --> 00:39:38,638
so the fact
that I'm doing that...

564
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:40,472
means you have to
hand it over to me...

565
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:43,843
which means
that what I say goes, OK?

566
00:39:43,914 --> 00:39:45,677
No.

567
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:48,082
Fine. Up to you.

568
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:50,450
Absolutely fine.

569
00:39:51,789 --> 00:39:52,983
It's cool.

570
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:03,260
Come on, please?
It's really good.

571
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:05,734
This is really great.
You'll thank me.

572
00:40:05,803 --> 00:40:08,397
- If you want to tell me, tell me.
- OK. You promise I'm the boss?

573
00:40:08,472 --> 00:40:10,406
How old are you?

574
00:40:10,474 --> 00:40:12,374
Look, only I cared to put
this thing together.

575
00:40:12,443 --> 00:40:14,934
I think that gives me a little ownership.
I'm not crazy here.

576
00:40:15,012 --> 00:40:17,947
I mean,
this is really, really good.

577
00:40:18,015 --> 00:40:20,074
OK, you're the boss, I agree.

578
00:40:20,151 --> 00:40:22,619
In all things pertaining to this
extraordinary development...

579
00:40:22,686 --> 00:40:24,278
I will be guided by you,
is that OK?

580
00:40:24,355 --> 00:40:26,585
- "Guided" meaning?
- Charley!

581
00:40:26,657 --> 00:40:28,591
OK.

582
00:40:28,659 --> 00:40:31,958
Max is your kid.

583
00:40:32,029 --> 00:40:35,362
Your biological descendant.

584
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:38,698
Your spawn.

585
00:40:44,341 --> 00:40:45,740
What're you talking about?

586
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:47,744
OK, this has been
bugging me for months...

587
00:40:47,812 --> 00:40:49,575
but now I'm so sure.

588
00:40:49,647 --> 00:40:53,777
Fact: 3½ years ago,
you donated sperm to their gyno.

589
00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:55,341
Yes.

590
00:40:55,419 --> 00:40:57,944
Fact: After three months of trying,
Pam said it wasn't working...

591
00:40:58,022 --> 00:41:00,013
and they were gonna get a donor
from a sperm bank.

592
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:02,251
Yes. They were
upset about it, remember?

593
00:41:02,326 --> 00:41:03,452
Pam was a wreck.

594
00:41:03,527 --> 00:41:05,995
Fact: six months later,
they're pregnant.

595
00:41:06,063 --> 00:41:10,466
Fact: Sperm can be kept viable
for up to twelve years...

596
00:41:10,534 --> 00:41:13,833
if frozen correctly,
according to this website I found.

597
00:41:13,904 --> 00:41:17,772
And fact: When your parents
came to visit a year ago...

598
00:41:17,842 --> 00:41:20,902
Pam, Max, and Diane all got sick...

599
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:22,775
and couldn't come over
to visit because your mother...

600
00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:25,645
would recognize Max
as her grandchild.

601
00:41:25,716 --> 00:41:28,276
And, finally...

602
00:41:32,089 --> 00:41:34,421
You... Max.

603
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:36,050
All kids look alike!

604
00:41:36,126 --> 00:41:38,890
No, no, no. No, you see it.

605
00:41:38,963 --> 00:41:42,228
You see it,
but you can't believe it.

606
00:41:42,299 --> 00:41:44,494
I can't believe it because...

607
00:41:44,568 --> 00:41:46,229
Come on,
it doesn't make sense.

608
00:41:46,303 --> 00:41:48,100
Why would they lie?

609
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:50,436
Because this way,
Max is all theirs.

610
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:52,499
They don't have to consult you
about anything.

611
00:41:52,576 --> 00:41:53,838
Sure, they'd lose a little money...

612
00:41:53,911 --> 00:41:55,538
but it's the power,
that's what they want.

613
00:41:55,613 --> 00:41:57,240
They don't have
to consider us at all.

614
00:41:57,314 --> 00:41:59,578
But if that's how
they feel about it...

615
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:01,345
why did they even try with us
in the first place?

616
00:42:01,418 --> 00:42:04,285
I don't know. Sentiment.

617
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:06,152
But then they thought
better of it.

618
00:42:06,223 --> 00:42:08,350
Maybe we were too enthusiastic.

619
00:42:08,425 --> 00:42:10,655
Maybe we got excited
and started talking about colleges...

620
00:42:10,728 --> 00:42:12,662
or said something nice
about sugar.

621
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:15,392
OK, then, you know,
they changed their mind.

622
00:42:15,466 --> 00:42:17,434
Why not really use sperm
from a sperm bank?

623
00:42:17,501 --> 00:42:19,401
Because you're a sure thing.

624
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:22,439
Look at you.
You're smart, you're sexy.

625
00:42:22,506 --> 00:42:26,169
You're not faggy at all.
The gayest thing about you is me.

626
00:42:30,014 --> 00:42:32,744
I've known Pam since
the eighth grade. She wouldn't lie.

627
00:42:32,816 --> 00:42:36,980
She's a mother.
It's a sick, sick bond.

628
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:38,954
Think of yours.

629
00:42:39,023 --> 00:42:42,515
Think of mine.
It's unwholesome.

630
00:42:42,593 --> 00:42:44,322
We have to call them.

631
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:46,124
No, no, they'll just deny it.

632
00:42:46,196 --> 00:42:49,165
Look, we have options.
We have plenty of options.

633
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:51,098
I think you should just let it sink in.

634
00:42:51,168 --> 00:42:53,693
- God!
- I'm the boss of this, remember?

635
00:42:53,771 --> 00:42:57,400
You're too emotional.
Just... trust me.

636
00:42:57,474 --> 00:43:00,307
Did you guys hear that thing
on NPR this morning?

637
00:43:00,377 --> 00:43:01,708
About sperm.

638
00:43:01,779 --> 00:43:03,508
Oh, no, no, no,
I didn't hear that one.

639
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:06,209
- Well, maybe it was yesterday.
- What was that?

640
00:43:06,283 --> 00:43:09,582
Just about storage
and freezing and stuff.

641
00:43:09,653 --> 00:43:12,281
Pam, those jeans are great.
Were those the ones...

642
00:43:12,356 --> 00:43:13,618
Where did we get those?
On Melrose?

643
00:43:13,691 --> 00:43:15,386
Those are the ones you picked out,
the French ones.

644
00:43:15,459 --> 00:43:17,552
- They're so good.
- Thanks.

645
00:43:17,628 --> 00:43:20,529
Do you guys know
how long sperm keeps?

646
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:21,758
- No.
- Do tell.

647
00:43:21,832 --> 00:43:23,094
Twelve years.

648
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:24,156
- What?
- Yeah.

649
00:43:24,234 --> 00:43:26,168
In the proper, you know, facility.

650
00:43:26,236 --> 00:43:28,602
I don't know
what it would be at home.

651
00:43:28,672 --> 00:43:30,902
Did you hear
the other story, though?

652
00:43:30,975 --> 00:43:33,000
It must have been after that,
on the Khmer Rouge...

653
00:43:33,077 --> 00:43:35,671
about that guy who was growing
vegetables behind the torture room?

654
00:43:35,746 --> 00:43:37,771
- No.
- That was devastating.

655
00:43:37,848 --> 00:43:39,782
I almost had to pull the car over.

656
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:43,786
- Was Max in the car?
- Yeah, but he was sleeping.

657
00:43:43,854 --> 00:43:46,049
Sugar, bad. Torture, fine.

658
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:47,147
Is that big enough, right here?

659
00:43:47,224 --> 00:43:48,885
That's great,
that's perfect for me.

660
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:50,324
Can I get some ice cream
with that?

661
00:43:50,394 --> 00:43:52,487
- Oh, absolutely.
- I'll get it.

662
00:43:52,563 --> 00:43:54,360
You know,
there's Tofutti in there, too.

663
00:43:54,431 --> 00:43:56,456
- Oh, good.
- You should try it.

664
00:44:34,071 --> 00:44:35,936
What are you still doing here?
Go play dominoes.

665
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:37,906
Get me some scissors
from the bathroom.

666
00:44:37,975 --> 00:44:39,067
What?

667
00:44:39,143 --> 00:44:40,610
We can take a DNA sample
from his hair...

668
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:41,906
but I can't pluck any
without waking him.

669
00:44:41,979 --> 00:44:43,537
What are you, crazy?
Just get away from him.

670
00:44:43,614 --> 00:44:45,275
Oh, my God, my car keys,
I forgot this.

671
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:46,941
You're not doing it.
Just give me those.

672
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:48,211
Yeah!
Come on, this is gonna work.

673
00:44:48,285 --> 00:44:49,718
Charley!

674
00:44:49,787 --> 00:44:51,084
Listen, I know
what those tests cost.

675
00:44:51,155 --> 00:44:53,123
No, Charley.

676
00:44:55,325 --> 00:44:57,850
Look at him, he's so cute
when he's sleeping.

677
00:44:57,928 --> 00:44:59,896
Yeah.

678
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:04,398
How can you not believe this?
Look at him!

679
00:45:04,468 --> 00:45:07,301
There's a photograph of you
at home looking just like this.

680
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:10,033
Stick him in Tinkerbell PJ's,
it's the spitting image.

681
00:45:10,107 --> 00:45:14,373
What is the matter with you? Jesus!
We are going to drop this, OK?

682
00:45:14,445 --> 00:45:17,039
Look at him. He's happy,
they're happy, we're happy.

683
00:45:17,114 --> 00:45:18,741
Just leave it alone, all right?

684
00:45:18,816 --> 00:45:20,181
Yeah, but you believe me now.

685
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:21,478
- No!
- Yeah.

686
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:23,747
I don't. Promise me, all right?

687
00:45:23,821 --> 00:45:25,220
I don't care
if you're positive about this.

688
00:45:25,289 --> 00:45:27,780
Just leave it alone.
I'm serious.

689
00:45:27,858 --> 00:45:29,655
OK. Fine.

690
00:45:30,794 --> 00:45:34,161
I'm not leaving here until
you're back in that living room.

691
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:35,823
Go.

692
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,377
Aw, man!

693
00:45:51,448 --> 00:45:53,348
This is awesome!

694
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:55,442
I'm so going to buy this from you
when we're done.

695
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:57,783
No, forget it, OK?
It's all going back to the store...

696
00:45:57,855 --> 00:46:00,449
before the credit card bill
comes, OK?

697
00:46:00,524 --> 00:46:02,924
So don't drop it.
That's not funny.

698
00:46:02,993 --> 00:46:04,688
Don't you know any of this stuff?

699
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:07,959
Oh, wow, you look really pretty
if I stand far away and I use the zoom.

700
00:46:08,031 --> 00:46:09,760
Thank you.

701
00:46:09,833 --> 00:46:11,698
OK, it's back to normal now.

702
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:13,259
- OK.
- Cool.

703
00:46:13,337 --> 00:46:14,827
All right, here, gimme the camera.

704
00:46:14,905 --> 00:46:15,929
OK, here, sure.

705
00:46:16,006 --> 00:46:18,236
OK, but right now.
Thank you.

706
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:21,775
All right, let's see.

707
00:46:21,845 --> 00:46:23,836
Just have to open the program.

708
00:46:23,914 --> 00:46:25,779
Here it comes.

709
00:46:25,849 --> 00:46:27,248
There it is!

710
00:46:28,752 --> 00:46:31,118
Who's that handsome guy, huh?

711
00:46:31,188 --> 00:46:32,951
Cool! Make it rewind
through the computer.

712
00:46:33,023 --> 00:46:34,957
OK, no! Not in my room!

713
00:46:35,025 --> 00:46:38,051
All right? It's this room,
the bathroom, the kitchen.

714
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:39,618
Everything else is off-limits.

715
00:46:39,696 --> 00:46:40,958
There. You're sleeping with Javier.

716
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:44,999
You could've told me.

717
00:46:45,068 --> 00:46:46,968
"This is my boyfriend.
He's a sex worker."

718
00:46:47,037 --> 00:46:50,700
- You're embarrassed, huh?
- No, it's none of your business.

719
00:46:50,774 --> 00:46:52,765
And it doesn't affect
any of this, does it?

720
00:46:52,843 --> 00:46:53,969
Wait, wait, wait,
rewind, rewind, rewind.

721
00:46:54,044 --> 00:46:55,944
Hey, who's that guy?

722
00:46:56,013 --> 00:46:57,071
Oh, my ex-husband.

723
00:46:58,282 --> 00:46:59,715
- Still hung up on him?
- No.

724
00:46:59,783 --> 00:47:02,946
That's there to remind me
what he's like when he calls.

725
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:06,183
He lost $62,000 that night.

726
00:47:06,256 --> 00:47:08,019
That could've been my money!

727
00:47:08,091 --> 00:47:10,457
Yeah, that's what
really hurts about it.

728
00:47:10,527 --> 00:47:11,824
Does Javier gamble?

729
00:47:13,363 --> 00:47:16,628
I don't know. I don't care.
I'm not planning to marry him.

730
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:20,158
Yeah, duh! He's creepy.

731
00:47:20,237 --> 00:47:22,671
"Senor Fingers!"

732
00:47:22,739 --> 00:47:24,798
I don't want him handing me
any cigarettes...

733
00:47:24,875 --> 00:47:26,866
if you know what I mean.

734
00:47:26,944 --> 00:47:28,741
So, you're just into him
for the sex.

735
00:47:28,812 --> 00:47:30,336
'Cause, I mean, I get that,
you know.

736
00:47:30,414 --> 00:47:32,678
He's dangerous. He's, like...

737
00:47:32,749 --> 00:47:36,515
gangs and handjobs and Mexican.

738
00:47:36,587 --> 00:47:38,316
I can see where
that'd be attractive...

739
00:47:38,388 --> 00:47:40,447
but, you know,
you've married the bad boy before.

740
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:43,288
Mr. Vegas, huh? Live and learn.

741
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,658
Naturally, as my extortionist...

742
00:47:45,729 --> 00:47:47,788
your insights
are particularly valuable.

743
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:49,730
Then why is he holding back,
though?

744
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,360
I mean, bring on the ring, dude!
Like, he should marry you.

745
00:47:52,436 --> 00:47:55,371
He should totally marry you.
You're a step up.

746
00:47:56,607 --> 00:47:59,508
OK. Well, this is in.
It's in the hard drive.

747
00:47:59,576 --> 00:48:01,544
When we're done with this,
we can edit.

748
00:48:02,913 --> 00:48:03,971
Watch.

749
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:10,084
Don't. No, don't. Oh, come on!

750
00:48:10,153 --> 00:48:14,283
That's not a zoom, incidentally.
Just the way it is.

751
00:48:14,358 --> 00:48:16,019
Like a penis, only bigger.

752
00:48:16,093 --> 00:48:17,424
Who raised you?

753
00:48:26,837 --> 00:48:30,238
How lucky am I?

754
00:48:30,307 --> 00:48:35,768
I'm yours, and I don't even care

755
00:48:35,846 --> 00:48:39,213
How lucky am I?

756
00:48:39,283 --> 00:48:41,251
I'm young

757
00:48:41,318 --> 00:48:44,845
With a few bucks to spare

758
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:48,722
And I don't even try

759
00:48:48,792 --> 00:48:54,230
I know it's all in my mind

760
00:48:54,298 --> 00:49:01,864
How lucky am I?

761
00:49:07,577 --> 00:49:13,447
I can't believe
all my good fortune

762
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:21,819
I count my blessings every day

763
00:49:25,829 --> 00:49:32,997
Should hurt to be so fun-loving

764
00:49:34,705 --> 00:49:38,835
My life must be a crime

765
00:49:38,909 --> 00:49:42,606
How lucky am I?

766
00:49:42,679 --> 00:49:45,341
He says,
"I can't take 67 more of those!"

767
00:49:47,718 --> 00:49:48,878
How's the food?

768
00:49:48,952 --> 00:49:50,385
Thanks, Mr. McKee. It's great.

769
00:49:50,454 --> 00:49:53,116
Yeah, we were just going
to hit up Taco Bell.

770
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:55,055
Well, it's my pleasure.
You guys are good.

771
00:49:55,125 --> 00:49:57,958
- How's the new amp?
- Makes a difference, yeah.

772
00:49:58,028 --> 00:50:01,555
You are really, really talented.

773
00:50:01,631 --> 00:50:05,658
Thank you.
I'm just trying to hang in there.

774
00:50:05,736 --> 00:50:07,067
What do you mean?

775
00:50:07,137 --> 00:50:08,866
She's just helping us out
until Rain gets out.

776
00:50:09,639 --> 00:50:12,836
Yeah, I need to get
a real job, anyway.

777
00:50:12,909 --> 00:50:15,878
I got evicted earlier this month.

778
00:50:15,946 --> 00:50:18,039
Actually, the guy that
I was subletting with got evicted...

779
00:50:18,115 --> 00:50:20,811
and none of my checks
made it to the landlady...

780
00:50:20,884 --> 00:50:22,408
so that was fun.

781
00:50:22,486 --> 00:50:25,455
Speaking of that, we should probably
get you back to your cousin's.

782
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:28,514
Wait. You're not sleeping
on someone's couch?

783
00:50:28,592 --> 00:50:29,889
It's an air bed.

784
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:32,428
You just push the button,
boom, it's full-sized.

785
00:50:32,496 --> 00:50:34,521
Otis, what is the matter
with you, dude?

786
00:50:34,598 --> 00:50:35,690
Dude?

787
00:50:35,766 --> 00:50:37,495
Listen, we got
an empty pool house.

788
00:50:37,567 --> 00:50:39,398
You move in there
till you find a place.

789
00:50:39,469 --> 00:50:41,630
- Oh, I don't know.
- We practice there, Dad.

790
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:43,263
That's what I'm saying.
It's no use to me.

791
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:46,070
It's got a big bedroom
and a full bathroom. You'll love it.

792
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:49,476
- Well, I don't know.
- I do. It's fine.

793
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:51,070
Miles, you'll know this.

794
00:50:51,148 --> 00:50:55,847
What would it take to get all you cats
into a studio to cut a CD?

795
00:50:55,919 --> 00:50:58,820
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

796
00:51:00,457 --> 00:51:02,254
Nice car.

797
00:51:03,927 --> 00:51:07,260
Well, my dad's letting me
run out the lease.

798
00:51:07,330 --> 00:51:09,958
Isn't it nice not being a fag?

799
00:51:11,635 --> 00:51:13,728
This is the thing...

800
00:51:13,804 --> 00:51:16,796
I'll totally help you find a new place.

801
00:51:16,873 --> 00:51:18,170
Because this is temporary.

802
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:20,471
That's what he said,
until you find your own place.

803
00:51:20,544 --> 00:51:23,012
Oh, what's it to you?

804
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,105
What do you mean?
This is too fast.

805
00:51:25,182 --> 00:51:26,774
We're sleeping together.

806
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:29,842
Yeah, once. It wasn't that fast.
It was good.

807
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:33,412
I'm just saying we've got to be
our own, independent people.

808
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:35,014
Suddenly,
we're, like, living together?

809
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:39,153
You know what? It's fine.
'Cause we're breaking up.

810
00:51:39,229 --> 00:51:40,389
What?

811
00:51:40,464 --> 00:51:43,524
Look, I'm not going to screw you
and your dad.

812
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:46,091
You're not going to fuck my dad.

813
00:51:46,169 --> 00:51:47,898
He is 44, OK?

814
00:51:47,971 --> 00:51:51,065
So, the first guy I slept with
was 38 and I was 13.

815
00:51:51,141 --> 00:51:52,733
My best friend's dad.

816
00:51:52,809 --> 00:51:55,243
You're making that up.
That's from American Beauty.

817
00:51:55,312 --> 00:51:56,677
It was exactly like that.

818
00:51:56,746 --> 00:51:59,237
Except I didn't have roses
coming out of my tits.

819
00:51:59,316 --> 00:52:01,807
My dad has lots of girlfriends,
and he spends money on them...

820
00:52:01,885 --> 00:52:04,353
but he doesn't marry them,
so you can forget that.

821
00:52:04,421 --> 00:52:06,480
Why would I want to marry him?

822
00:52:06,556 --> 00:52:09,821
Like that's what I need...
a gay stepson.

823
00:52:11,495 --> 00:52:14,487
You think I'm just going to let someone
take advantage of my father?

824
00:52:14,564 --> 00:52:18,330
Hey, butt boy, listen...

825
00:52:19,769 --> 00:52:21,794
if you don't help me with this...

826
00:52:21,872 --> 00:52:23,567
I'm going to tell him you're gay...

827
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:27,508
and then you'll be out
on your ass, not me, OK?

828
00:52:28,578 --> 00:52:29,704
So...

829
00:52:31,915 --> 00:52:33,940
First thing you gotta do is,
you gotta break up with me...

830
00:52:34,017 --> 00:52:37,509
because there's no way your dad's
gonna fuck his son's first real girlfriend.

831
00:52:37,587 --> 00:52:38,918
He's got morals.

832
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:41,048
Yeah, well,
I am dumping you, OK?

833
00:52:41,124 --> 00:52:42,386
Just so you know.

834
00:52:42,459 --> 00:52:45,917
Yeah. But let me tell you why.

835
00:52:48,298 --> 00:52:50,892
- Breakfast?
- No, thanks.

836
00:52:50,967 --> 00:52:52,958
Thought you were out
in the pool house.

837
00:52:53,036 --> 00:52:54,298
Why?

838
00:52:54,371 --> 00:52:56,669
Otis, it's OK if you want
to spend the night with Jude.

839
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:59,402
It's fine.
You're not a teenager anymore.

840
00:52:59,476 --> 00:53:03,378
- She get settled in all right?
- She's moving out.

841
00:53:03,446 --> 00:53:05,004
What?

842
00:53:05,081 --> 00:53:06,639
We broke up.

843
00:53:06,716 --> 00:53:09,048
I mean, I broke up with her.

844
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:11,019
She's moving back
to her cousin's...

845
00:53:11,087 --> 00:53:12,952
and she might not even be
in the band anymore.

846
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:15,389
- I don't know.
- What happened?

847
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:20,261
She lied to me about her age.

848
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:23,822
She's not 24, she's 29.

849
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:26,733
She's too old.

850
00:53:26,803 --> 00:53:30,864
- She's 29?
- Yeah, for another month.

851
00:53:30,941 --> 00:53:34,900
I don't want to date a 30-year-old.
I'm 22. You know?

852
00:53:34,978 --> 00:53:37,139
I could be in college.

853
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:39,148
Why would she lie about her age?

854
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:42,276
I just assumed.

855
00:53:42,352 --> 00:53:45,412
I don't know. Anyway, she...

856
00:53:45,488 --> 00:53:48,218
she wants to use the pool today.
I said it was OK.

857
00:53:48,291 --> 00:53:54,230
Her cousin's at work,
and she gave back her key.

858
00:53:54,297 --> 00:53:56,925
Well, I'm sorry things
turned out this way.

859
00:53:58,835 --> 00:54:02,168
I'm going over to Alvin's.

860
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:04,730
In the Lexus.

861
00:54:04,808 --> 00:54:06,400
Sure, sure.

862
00:54:06,476 --> 00:54:08,103
Sure, whatever.

863
00:54:21,324 --> 00:54:23,053
Hey.

864
00:54:23,126 --> 00:54:24,855
Oh, hey, Mr. McKee.

865
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:27,226
No, Frank.

866
00:54:27,297 --> 00:54:28,594
Listen...

867
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,897
I hear things are a little tricky.

868
00:54:31,968 --> 00:54:33,697
Yeah.

869
00:54:35,071 --> 00:54:37,733
Thanks for the pool house thing
and all.

870
00:54:37,807 --> 00:54:39,968
I don't think it's going to work out.

871
00:54:40,043 --> 00:54:42,637
You know, I'd really hate
to see you leave the band.

872
00:54:42,712 --> 00:54:45,044
They really need you.

873
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:47,481
Well, it's kind of up to Otis.

874
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:49,017
I could talk to him.

875
00:54:49,085 --> 00:54:52,020
I mean, every woman lies
about her age a little bit.

876
00:54:52,088 --> 00:54:54,215
That's what he told you
it was about?

877
00:54:56,493 --> 00:54:58,393
Man, it's not that.

878
00:54:59,929 --> 00:55:02,329
He's got someone else.

879
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:04,367
Lane.

880
00:55:04,434 --> 00:55:08,063
Lane? That's a girl's name?

881
00:55:09,506 --> 00:55:11,804
He didn't tell you
anything about her?

882
00:55:11,875 --> 00:55:15,106
You don't know your son
very well, do you?

883
00:55:15,178 --> 00:55:17,237
Well, I don't think
you should leave.

884
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:20,340
I insist you stay.
I'm going to talk to Otis...

885
00:55:20,417 --> 00:55:23,011
'cause that's no way to treat
somebody you care about.

886
00:55:24,587 --> 00:55:26,919
I wish he was more like you.

887
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:31,154
Well, he's young, and maybe
I could have done a better job.

888
00:55:31,227 --> 00:55:33,752
But I was a kid
when I had him, practically.

889
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:35,263
Do you know what?

890
00:55:36,466 --> 00:55:38,832
You remind me
of the first boy I dated.

891
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:42,170
Hardly a boy.

892
00:55:42,238 --> 00:55:43,705
Now you're lying.

893
00:56:00,423 --> 00:56:02,050
Oh, my God.

894
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:05,485
Oh, my God.

895
00:56:05,562 --> 00:56:08,463
Yeah, that's why
I've been behaving so weird lately.

896
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:10,499
You know. We both have.

897
00:56:10,567 --> 00:56:12,364
I just... I...
I can't even believe this.

898
00:56:12,435 --> 00:56:14,062
I can't believe
we're having this conversation.

899
00:56:16,439 --> 00:56:20,933
All right.
So... what kind of disease?

900
00:56:22,779 --> 00:56:25,475
He won't say, you know? He...

901
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:27,914
It's neurological, he told me that.

902
00:56:27,984 --> 00:56:29,349
Oh, my God.

903
00:56:29,419 --> 00:56:31,785
Yeah. Hereditary.

904
00:56:33,623 --> 00:56:37,150
All the males in his family
have to be tested for it.

905
00:56:40,563 --> 00:56:42,588
Do you... I mean,
what's the name of it?

906
00:56:44,834 --> 00:56:46,859
It's not MS, I know that.

907
00:56:46,936 --> 00:56:49,097
Well, is it like MS?

908
00:56:49,172 --> 00:56:52,266
Well, it's... I don't know.

909
00:56:52,342 --> 00:56:54,674
Are you forgetting the name of it?

910
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:56,905
He didn't want me to interfere,
you know?

911
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:58,504
He just thought I would be,
you know...

912
00:56:58,581 --> 00:56:59,775
that I would be on the internet...

913
00:56:59,849 --> 00:57:02,545
and I'd be talking to doctors
and nagging him.

914
00:57:02,619 --> 00:57:04,519
Like I'm that guy, you know.
I'm not that guy.

915
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:07,021
All right. What are the symptoms?
Do you know the symptoms?

916
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:10,218
Yeah. Did you know
Gil's grandfather...

917
00:57:10,293 --> 00:57:12,090
when you were
at high school together?

918
00:57:12,162 --> 00:57:13,629
No. I don't think so.

919
00:57:13,696 --> 00:57:18,156
I don't... I don't even remember Gil
talking about him or mentioning him.

920
00:57:18,234 --> 00:57:22,193
Well, I'm not surprised.
It's pretty debilitating.

921
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:24,206
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

922
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:25,502
Hey, it's not fatal.

923
00:57:25,575 --> 00:57:26,837
- It's OK.
- It's not?

924
00:57:26,910 --> 00:57:30,243
No, no, no. It's just untreatable.

925
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:33,408
Yeah.

926
00:57:35,518 --> 00:57:38,510
All right. So, when...
I mean, what do we do?

927
00:57:39,689 --> 00:57:43,420
Pam, you mustn't say that we...
You can't tell him we spoke.

928
00:57:43,493 --> 00:57:46,462
Oh, God. All right. I mean, I...
Yeah.

929
00:57:46,529 --> 00:57:49,828
He would kill me
if he knew we'd spoken.

930
00:57:49,899 --> 00:57:53,926
- Oh, my God. Max!
- Max?

931
00:57:54,003 --> 00:57:56,836
I've got to go pick him up.
I gotta get myself together.

932
00:57:56,906 --> 00:57:59,773
- That's the one comfort we have.
- What?

933
00:57:59,843 --> 00:58:02,641
You know, that you guys
couldn't get pregnant...

934
00:58:02,712 --> 00:58:05,647
with Gil's, you know.

935
00:58:05,715 --> 00:58:08,149
Like your body knew somehow.

936
00:58:08,218 --> 00:58:11,779
Just said... not allowed.

937
00:58:11,855 --> 00:58:15,484
I gotta go. I gotta go. Sorry.

938
00:58:15,558 --> 00:58:18,857
Hey, Pam,
I think it's going to be OK.

939
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:23,824
I gotta say, man, I'm glad
she's not here for first day...

940
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:26,334
'cause she's, like, opinionated.

941
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:31,299
All right.

942
00:58:33,243 --> 00:58:37,043
What did you do
to your face, man?

943
00:58:37,113 --> 00:58:39,604
- What do you mean?
- You got a fake moustache on.

944
00:58:39,682 --> 00:58:40,979
Oh, yeah. You like it?

945
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:42,677
It's so my clients don't notice me,
you know?

946
00:58:42,752 --> 00:58:44,617
It's a little make-up, too,
that Mamie has.

947
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:48,384
Mamie's white, OK?
You look like a scared Mexican.

948
00:58:48,458 --> 00:58:49,925
Like, down at the border
on the news.

949
00:58:49,993 --> 00:58:51,551
Hey, come on.
That's my face up there, OK?

950
00:58:51,628 --> 00:58:52,925
It's gonna look good
through the camera.

951
00:58:52,996 --> 00:58:54,224
- Just shoot.
- It's cool, man.

952
00:58:54,297 --> 00:58:55,355
I don't know how
it's gonna read. I guess...

953
00:58:55,431 --> 00:58:57,422
- Come on. I gotta go.
- Well, it looks all right.

954
00:58:57,500 --> 00:59:00,128
OK. We're rolling, we're rolling.

955
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:01,966
Came up with a list of questions
that, you know...

956
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:03,869
everybody who's ever gotten
a massage, I'm sure, wants to know.

957
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:05,339
Have you had a massage, ever?

958
00:59:05,408 --> 00:59:07,308
Yeah, I have.
Actually, let's start with that.

959
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:09,902
What do you do
when somebody lets one out...

960
00:59:09,979 --> 00:59:12,311
while you're massaging them?
Do you just keep going?

961
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:15,545
Is that what the incense is for?
Take me through that.

962
00:59:15,618 --> 00:59:17,142
You farted today inside.

963
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:19,279
- No.
- You said it was her!

964
00:59:19,355 --> 00:59:21,152
- Cut!
- You know something?

965
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:22,816
Women don't fart like that,
my friend.

966
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:24,883
Do me a favor?
Take a picture of me.

967
00:59:24,961 --> 00:59:29,057
I forgot, I wanted to do it before.
So we'll get back to this.

968
00:59:29,132 --> 00:59:30,895
Ready?

969
00:59:30,967 --> 00:59:33,629
Your fly's open.

970
00:59:33,703 --> 00:59:34,863
Good.

971
00:59:34,938 --> 00:59:37,031
Here we go. What's it like...

972
00:59:37,106 --> 00:59:41,042
when some woman
you're massaging lets one out?

973
00:59:41,110 --> 00:59:43,340
OK, they're cooked
all the way now.

974
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:45,074
I didn't know. I like 'em pink.

975
00:59:45,148 --> 00:59:49,312
OK. Maybe we have five minutes,
in a montage...

976
00:59:49,385 --> 00:59:51,250
with music covering the stupidity.

977
00:59:51,321 --> 00:59:54,313
- We shot for two hours.
- Yeah, and it's garbage.

978
00:59:54,390 --> 00:59:59,657
Nicky, who cares who invented
that donut that people put their face in?

979
00:59:59,729 --> 01:00:00,957
It's called a cradle, OK?

980
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:03,863
A face cradle,
and I think it's interesting.

981
01:00:03,933 --> 01:00:06,902
And farts?
And who pays for the lotion?

982
01:00:06,970 --> 01:00:09,632
And, so, OK,
how do people tip you?

983
01:00:09,706 --> 01:00:11,799
Because they're naked,
so where's the wallet?

984
01:00:11,874 --> 01:00:14,536
That's neat, OK?
The little envelopes at the front desk?

985
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:15,771
I didn't know that.

986
01:00:15,845 --> 01:00:18,177
All right. Do you want
to get into film school?

987
01:00:18,247 --> 01:00:20,408
- Yeah.
- Because I don't care.

988
01:00:20,483 --> 01:00:22,417
I just have to help you
make a documentary.

989
01:00:22,485 --> 01:00:25,352
As good as the one
you're not letting me make.

990
01:00:25,421 --> 01:00:27,889
No. No. Just a documentary.

991
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:30,187
If you want a stupid interview...

992
01:00:30,259 --> 01:00:32,557
that you could see
on the local news, fine.

993
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:34,961
But if you want this to be good...

994
01:00:35,031 --> 01:00:38,194
if you want people
to care about him...

995
01:00:38,267 --> 01:00:39,928
you have to have a point of view.

996
01:00:40,003 --> 01:00:41,436
I have a point of view!

997
01:00:41,504 --> 01:00:43,369
This guy has it made,
and I care...

998
01:00:43,439 --> 01:00:46,033
because I want to see him
get all these ladies off.

999
01:00:46,109 --> 01:00:48,134
- That's your reasoning?
- Yes!

1000
01:00:48,211 --> 01:00:50,270
Oh, OK. All right.
Well, I'm relieved.

1001
01:00:50,346 --> 01:00:52,109
What does that mean?

1002
01:00:52,181 --> 01:00:54,775
It means someone smart
would be harder to please.

1003
01:00:54,851 --> 01:00:58,014
But if you're stupid,
hey, just makes my job easier.

1004
01:00:58,087 --> 01:00:59,748
What did you just call me?

1005
01:01:01,391 --> 01:01:04,827
Forget it. It's OK.

1006
01:01:06,896 --> 01:01:10,263
You know,
you say "stupid" too much.

1007
01:01:11,534 --> 01:01:14,628
I just mean, I think
you're better than this...

1008
01:01:14,704 --> 01:01:16,001
or you could be.

1009
01:01:16,072 --> 01:01:19,337
Yeah, well I think that goes
for everybody...

1010
01:01:19,409 --> 01:01:21,673
from what I can see
from right here.

1011
01:01:31,821 --> 01:01:35,052
Anyway, the makeup blows.
I'll give you that.

1012
01:01:35,124 --> 01:01:38,651
It's no fun thinking of him
nailing all these women...

1013
01:01:38,728 --> 01:01:42,164
if he might be a homo,
but that's just me.

1014
01:01:43,399 --> 01:01:44,957
That's my beer.

1015
01:01:46,502 --> 01:01:47,992
Sorry.

1016
01:01:48,071 --> 01:01:49,095
It's OK.

1017
01:01:49,172 --> 01:01:52,471
OK. All right.

1018
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:54,635
It's gonna be OK.

1019
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:56,110
All right,
well, it's gonna be good.

1020
01:01:56,179 --> 01:01:57,806
We'll just go through it again.

1021
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:00,974
I got two hours of footage.

1022
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:02,142
Yeah.

1023
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:03,947
Will you do me a favor,
for my sanity?

1024
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:05,385
Will you just say to me...

1025
01:02:05,455 --> 01:02:07,389
Please just say to me right now...

1026
01:02:07,457 --> 01:02:11,052
five minutes was an overestimation.

1027
01:02:39,322 --> 01:02:41,290
Jesus Christ.

1028
01:02:43,493 --> 01:02:44,790
Time to go.

1029
01:02:47,296 --> 01:02:48,786
Hey, Charley.

1030
01:02:48,865 --> 01:02:50,423
That was Pam and Diane
from the car.

1031
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:52,661
They're on their way over.

1032
01:02:52,735 --> 01:02:54,532
I thought we were seeing them
tonight at Jill's.

1033
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:57,164
They say they have
something to tell us.

1034
01:03:00,343 --> 01:03:02,243
Wow. That was fast.

1035
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:10,411
You know, don't you?

1036
01:03:16,826 --> 01:03:19,761
All right, guys.
I don't know where to begin.

1037
01:03:19,829 --> 01:03:21,729
- Oh, well...
- So...

1038
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:25,427
Look, you know, these things,
they just get out of hand.

1039
01:03:25,501 --> 01:03:27,264
I mean, you know,
you want to tell...

1040
01:03:27,336 --> 01:03:29,236
you want to get it off your chest.

1041
01:03:29,305 --> 01:03:32,502
And I'm sure every night
you think you will...

1042
01:03:32,575 --> 01:03:34,941
and it just gets
harder and harder.

1043
