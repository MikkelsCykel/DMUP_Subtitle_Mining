1
00:02:04,042 --> 00:02:06,628
<i>Some call Bregna the perfect society.</i>

2
00:02:08,421 --> 00:02:11,049
Some call it
the height of human civilisation.

3
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,678
But others know better.

4
00:02:18,556 --> 00:02:21,726
The Goodchilds built Bregna
to ensure us a future.

5
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,732
They built the Relical,

6
00:02:28,066 --> 00:02:31,110
a memorial to remind us
of what we've survived.

7
00:02:34,405 --> 00:02:36,741
They built walls to protect us.

8
00:02:39,035 --> 00:02:43,540
They tell us that outside,
nature has retaken the world.

9
00:02:49,796 --> 00:02:52,173
But the real problems lie within.

10
00:02:56,928 --> 00:03:00,056
We are haunted
by sorrows we cannot name.

11
00:03:00,974 --> 00:03:02,684
People disappear

12
00:03:03,434 --> 00:03:06,104
and our government
denies these crimes.

13
00:03:06,813 --> 00:03:11,359
The Goodchild regime provides for us,
as long as we stay quiet.

14
00:03:12,652 --> 00:03:16,781
So we trade freedom for a gilded cage.

15
00:03:18,616 --> 00:03:21,578
But there are rebels
who refuse to make that trade,

16
00:03:22,537 --> 00:03:25,915
who fight to overthrow a government
that silences us,

17
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:30,587
who fight
in the name of the disappeared.

18
00:03:35,133 --> 00:03:37,802
They call themselves the Monicans.

19
00:03:40,638 --> 00:03:42,849
I am one of them.

20
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:53,920
Handler.

21
00:04:54,462 --> 00:04:55,546
Aeon.

22
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:58,758
We have an assignment.

23
00:04:59,509 --> 00:05:03,096
We want you to sabotage Goodchild's
central surveillance facility.

24
00:05:03,721 --> 00:05:08,476
Your entry will be noticed, but we will
briefly disrupt their interior alarms.

25
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:12,355
Surveillance is their greatest tool
against us.

26
00:05:12,855 --> 00:05:16,150
As long as Monicans can be seen,
we can be targeted.

27
00:05:17,235 --> 00:05:19,237
We need you to blind them.

28
00:05:21,572 --> 00:05:25,702
Each mission brings us closer
to defeating the Goodchild regime.

29
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:34,168
This is my daughter.
Have you seen her?

30
00:05:34,252 --> 00:05:36,254
She disappeared two months ago.

31
00:05:37,046 --> 00:05:39,841
Help me, please, miss.
Have you seen this girl?

32
00:05:40,049 --> 00:05:42,010
She disappeared two months ago.

33
00:05:42,093 --> 00:05:44,929
Losing sleep? Having bad dreams?

34
00:05:45,013 --> 00:05:47,348
Visit our sleep centre for help.

35
00:05:48,266 --> 00:05:52,186
Losing sleep? Having bad dreams?
Visit our sleep...

36
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:54,063
Shopping for me, Una?

37
00:05:55,273 --> 00:05:57,400
Haven't you heard?
It's a special occasion.

38
00:05:57,483 --> 00:06:00,153
My sister's finally coming to dinner.

39
00:06:00,987 --> 00:06:03,197
Claudius and I
are looking forward to tonight.

40
00:06:03,281 --> 00:06:06,409
For once, you'll be in the house
long enough to sit down.

41
00:06:06,492 --> 00:06:08,953
That's why
I wanted to meet with you here.

42
00:06:10,121 --> 00:06:11,205
Aeon.

43
00:06:11,289 --> 00:06:13,541
I may not make it tonight, I'm sorry.

44
00:06:15,418 --> 00:06:16,794
Don't be upset.

45
00:06:16,878 --> 00:06:19,213
It's not that you can't come to dinner.

46
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:21,382
It's why.

47
00:06:21,466 --> 00:06:23,885
You know,
I used to imagine you'd come with me.

48
00:06:23,968 --> 00:06:26,554
We have different ways
of solving problems.

49
00:06:26,637 --> 00:06:29,182
Yes. You ignore them.

50
00:06:29,307 --> 00:06:31,726
How could I possibly ignore them?

51
00:06:31,893 --> 00:06:34,228
Excuse me. This is my daughter.

52
00:06:35,396 --> 00:06:38,858
I see the problems. I feel them.

53
00:06:40,026 --> 00:06:43,154
And I'm trying
to make something good out of it.

54
00:06:44,655 --> 00:06:47,325
- A life.
- What kind of life is it?

55
00:06:51,204 --> 00:06:53,039
There are good things here.

56
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:57,668
There's one.

57
00:07:02,507 --> 00:07:05,551
- So I have a surprise for you.
- Tell me.

58
00:07:06,886 --> 00:07:08,137
Tonight.

59
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:12,183
So be careful.

60
00:07:13,392 --> 00:07:14,894
And come back.

61
00:07:16,354 --> 00:07:19,148
Losing sleep? Having bad dreams?

62
00:07:19,232 --> 00:07:21,442
Visit our sleep centre for help.

63
00:07:22,443 --> 00:07:25,196
Losing sleep? Having bad dreams?

64
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:27,156
Visit our sleep centre for help.

65
00:08:42,398 --> 00:08:46,277
Possible Monican consort.
Three subjects.

66
00:08:47,445 --> 00:08:49,530
Identification requested.

67
00:08:50,239 --> 00:08:53,075
Possible Monican activity suspected.

68
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,711
It's not that you can't come to dinner.

69
00:09:03,794 --> 00:09:04,795
It's why.

70
00:09:06,005 --> 00:09:08,841
You know,
I used to imagine you'd come with me.

71
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:16,474
I think we have different ways
of solving problems.

72
00:09:17,433 --> 00:09:19,393
This is the way things are
and I'm trying

73
00:09:19,477 --> 00:09:22,271
to make something good out of it. A life.

74
00:10:15,533 --> 00:10:17,451
You're early, Claudius.

75
00:10:30,756 --> 00:10:32,675
But they're everywhere.

76
00:10:32,925 --> 00:10:35,052
We need to protect you from them.

77
00:10:58,075 --> 00:11:00,828
This is how Chairman Goodchild
deals with Monicans.

78
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:02,413
But she wasn't...

79
00:11:03,331 --> 00:11:05,124
She wasn't a Monican.

80
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:22,433
I had a family once.

81
00:11:26,354 --> 00:11:27,855
I had a life.

82
00:11:32,443 --> 00:11:34,278
Now all I have is a mission.

83
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:47,416
Una.

84
00:11:49,752 --> 00:11:50,753
Aeon.

85
00:11:51,337 --> 00:11:53,214
Aeon, Una.

86
00:11:53,297 --> 00:11:54,590
Aeon.

87
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:56,133
Come back.

88
00:12:42,304 --> 00:12:43,347
Yes.

89
00:12:44,098 --> 00:12:45,891
She will see you now.

90
00:13:00,072 --> 00:13:01,282
Handler.

91
00:13:01,699 --> 00:13:02,908
Aeon.

92
00:13:03,367 --> 00:13:04,952
We have an assignment.

93
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:07,371
One you've been waiting for.

94
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,747
Goodchild.

95
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:13,127
We've intercepted information that
will allow us to penetrate his security.

96
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,881
We want you to eliminate him.

97
00:13:17,423 --> 00:13:19,550
You should've sent me in earlier.

98
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:22,470
- That would've been suicide.
- Not for me.

99
00:13:22,553 --> 00:13:23,846
Patience, Aeon.

100
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:26,765
It has taken a year
to get the information we need.

101
00:13:26,891 --> 00:13:29,059
I know you want to do this for Una.

102
00:13:29,518 --> 00:13:32,730
But you must remember,
this is larger than you.

103
00:13:33,731 --> 00:13:36,692
She's not the only innocent person
who's been killed.

104
00:13:39,737 --> 00:13:41,405
This is our moment.

105
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:43,908
We have never been stronger.

106
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:46,660
People are frightened, yes...

107
00:13:46,744 --> 00:13:48,829
but if we show them the way,

108
00:13:48,913 --> 00:13:51,290
they will rise behind us when he's gone.

109
00:13:51,874 --> 00:13:53,209
I'm ready.

110
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:09,266
Tomorrow, Goodchild will be preparing
his address to the Council.

111
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,938
To reach the government zone, you
will need to cross the frontier garden.

112
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:18,317
Once you are through the garden,
you must move quickly to the Citadel.

113
00:14:19,652 --> 00:14:22,571
The underground interior has been built
to be confusing.

114
00:14:22,655 --> 00:14:26,325
We've implanted a route for you.
Follow it.

115
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:29,370
I want Sithandra with me
for the crossing.

116
00:14:29,453 --> 00:14:32,039
Of course. Get to the Forum.

117
00:14:32,122 --> 00:14:34,500
That's where
Chairman Goodchild will be.

118
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:37,127
You know what to do from there.

119
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:38,462
Yes.

120
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:42,800
Do this and you will have your revenge.

121
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,344
And we will all have our victory.

122
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,488
Hello, Sithandra.

123
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:10,327
- Still can't surprise you.
- Not yet.

124
00:15:14,498 --> 00:15:16,208
How are the modifications?

125
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:27,261
Useful.

126
00:15:27,845 --> 00:15:29,513
You should have it done.

127
00:15:29,847 --> 00:15:31,181
I like my shoes.

128
00:15:35,978 --> 00:15:40,190
Warning. End of civilian zone.
Do not proceed.

129
00:15:46,697 --> 00:15:49,158
Warning. Do not proceed.

130
00:15:49,241 --> 00:15:50,409
Ready?

131
00:15:51,493 --> 00:15:52,578
Always.

132
00:15:52,661 --> 00:15:54,872
Warning. Do not proceed.

133
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:08,237
- Sithandra.
- Let's keep moving.

134
00:17:09,446 --> 00:17:12,074
- We understand these now?
- Completely.

135
00:18:09,548 --> 00:18:11,467
I'd keep off the grass.

136
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:21,143
- Rendezvous at 1620.
- I'll be waiting.

137
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:26,333
I agree with the policy
of targeting proven Monican threats.

138
00:19:26,542 --> 00:19:28,836
But I'm afraid we're going too far.

139
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:31,171
We can't go too far with them.

140
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:37,886
There are advantages
to showing a degree of leniency.

141
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:41,598
We can't allow them the luxury of hope.
Not even one of them.

142
00:19:41,682 --> 00:19:43,976
Brute force isn't the only option.

143
00:19:44,101 --> 00:19:45,519
It's an effective one.

144
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:48,313
The Monicans are growing strong.
Soon, force won't be enough.

145
00:19:48,397 --> 00:19:50,899
So you want to compromise?
Negotiate?

146
00:19:51,316 --> 00:19:53,443
The policy should be reconsidered.

147
00:19:53,986 --> 00:19:57,447
- Put to a vote.
- The policy is not up for debate!

148
00:19:58,115 --> 00:20:00,284
I'm debating it!

149
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:06,957
I'd encourage you to look at this
with a little more detachment, Giroux.

150
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:10,127
Here, we must be impersonal.

151
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:15,465
You wouldn't want me to take
your outburst personally, would you?

152
00:20:34,109 --> 00:20:35,485
That is all.

153
00:20:38,363 --> 00:20:39,615
Oren?

154
00:20:48,749 --> 00:20:51,418
I'm getting worried about you, Oren.
This edge you've taken.

155
00:20:51,501 --> 00:20:53,337
Displays like that aren't helpful to us.

156
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:56,548
I believe in protecting what we've
created. I won't apologise for that.

157
00:20:56,632 --> 00:20:59,134
This was created
to allow me to do my work.

158
00:20:59,426 --> 00:21:02,429
I can't do that
if you can't control yourself.

159
00:21:03,847 --> 00:21:05,724
- Understood.
- Is it?

160
00:21:06,892 --> 00:21:07,893
Yes.

161
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:13,357
- And what about the test results?
- All negative.

162
00:21:16,485 --> 00:21:17,569
Sorry.

163
00:21:18,028 --> 00:21:20,197
Find me a new test group by morning.

164
00:21:20,989 --> 00:21:23,700
Maybe it's time
to give up on the tests, Trevor.

165
00:21:24,493 --> 00:21:27,496
We're living the solution already.
This is perfection.

166
00:21:27,579 --> 00:21:30,916
- Why can't you just embrace it?
- You see what's happening to people.

167
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:32,751
You know
how desperate this has become.

168
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:35,420
It can be contained. Controlled.

169
00:21:35,921 --> 00:21:39,549
I think you're forgetting
that this was all meant to be temporary.

170
00:21:39,716 --> 00:21:42,177
We've always said that,
but why should it be?

171
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,720
Because it's wrong.

172
00:21:43,971 --> 00:21:45,222
Things change.

173
00:21:46,765 --> 00:21:48,308
But I know you won't.

174
00:21:49,142 --> 00:21:50,352
You know me.

175
00:21:50,894 --> 00:21:53,063
I've been your brother a long time.

176
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:54,648
You're right about that.

177
00:21:54,731 --> 00:21:56,525
Trevor, your speech.

178
00:21:58,902 --> 00:22:00,153
Trevor...

179
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:20,424
Useless.

180
00:22:36,273 --> 00:22:38,775
- State destination.
- Forum.

181
00:22:40,152 --> 00:22:41,778
Proceed forward.

182
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:49,161
Proceed left.

183
00:22:51,288 --> 00:22:53,123
I know you have fears.

184
00:22:53,582 --> 00:22:57,419
You have sorrows that shake your belief
and try your patience.

185
00:22:58,128 --> 00:23:00,714
But now more than ever,
we must stand together

186
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:02,966
because there are those among us

187
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:05,635
who would tear down
what we have built.

188
00:23:06,011 --> 00:23:08,388
The Monicans seek to divide us.

189
00:23:08,513 --> 00:23:10,766
We must never forget who we are,

190
00:23:10,849 --> 00:23:13,810
a lonely outpost, a tiny band.

191
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:18,106
We're all that remains of a people
that once covered the Earth.

192
00:23:18,315 --> 00:23:21,068
We must adapt together
to these new challenges.

193
00:23:21,985 --> 00:23:26,406
Remember what we have faced,
what we have survived.

194
00:23:27,282 --> 00:23:28,784
We will adapt.

195
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:34,539
We have always adapted.

196
00:23:41,838 --> 00:23:44,257
It's the fabric of who we are.

197
00:23:54,351 --> 00:23:55,727
Katherine.

198
00:24:10,033 --> 00:24:11,284
It's you.

199
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:30,804
Katherine.

200
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:23,690
Wait outside.

201
00:25:35,827 --> 00:25:36,953
Aeon.

202
00:25:37,829 --> 00:25:39,956
You called me by another name earlier.

203
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,792
I did, and you let me live.

204
00:25:42,959 --> 00:25:46,213
Give me my gun. We'll try it again.

205
00:25:46,504 --> 00:25:48,131
Maybe later.

206
00:25:49,716 --> 00:25:51,468
What was that name?

207
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:55,347
You know me, don't you?

208
00:25:56,306 --> 00:25:57,349
No.

209
00:25:58,308 --> 00:26:00,143
Do you know who you are?

210
00:26:00,936 --> 00:26:04,481
- I know I came here to kill you.
- That's why you're in a cell.

211
00:26:06,441 --> 00:26:09,194
But we're both still alive for a reason.

212
00:26:14,616 --> 00:26:16,618
I don't know what this is

213
00:26:19,287 --> 00:26:21,414
but it's good to see you.

214
00:26:59,035 --> 00:27:00,453
Amateurs.

215
00:28:07,979 --> 00:28:09,314
Good boys.

216
00:28:42,806 --> 00:28:45,016
- Aeon.
- Little busy, Sithandra.

217
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,476
Is it done?

218
00:28:48,269 --> 00:28:49,896
I need more time.

219
00:28:50,271 --> 00:28:52,107
Our information on him may be wrong.

220
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:55,360
I don't understand this.
We have to move. I hope you...

221
00:28:55,443 --> 00:28:57,654
Don't question me, Sithandra.

222
00:28:59,489 --> 00:29:00,782
I'll contact you soon.

223
00:29:00,865 --> 00:29:03,743
Aeon, you know
there will be consequences to this.

224
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:05,787
I know what I'm doing.

225
00:29:08,498 --> 00:29:09,666
This is outrageous.

226
00:29:09,749 --> 00:29:11,918
One Monican
eluding all of our defences?

227
00:29:12,001 --> 00:29:13,420
The problem will be taken care of.

228
00:29:13,503 --> 00:29:15,797
The problem is
Trevor's concept of security.

229
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,966
He needs to learn to accept
more traditional...

230
00:29:18,049 --> 00:29:20,343
He needs to learn to accept our input.

231
00:29:20,552 --> 00:29:23,555
Another example of him pursuing his
own agenda, no matter what we think.

232
00:29:23,638 --> 00:29:26,474
- I'm beginning to question his agenda.
- Meaning?

233
00:29:26,558 --> 00:29:29,227
The Monican tries to kill him
and he lets her live?

234
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:30,770
An unusual choice.

235
00:29:31,354 --> 00:29:32,814
And now she's escaped.

236
00:29:32,897 --> 00:29:34,607
Does anyone believe
this is a coincidence?

237
00:29:34,691 --> 00:29:36,526
Do you really think
that I'm a sympathetic ear

238
00:29:36,609 --> 00:29:38,695
for your complaints about Trevor?

239
00:29:39,863 --> 00:29:42,657
You don't have the right
to question what he does.

240
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:44,868
You must be concerned, Oren.

241
00:29:45,827 --> 00:29:47,454
This is hardly routine.

242
00:29:48,705 --> 00:29:50,832
I think I should talk with Trevor.

243
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,835
And I think
all of you should be more discreet.

244
00:29:56,588 --> 00:29:57,755
Inari?

245
00:30:01,801 --> 00:30:03,887
Image retrieval commencing.

246
00:30:04,512 --> 00:30:05,805
What happened?

247
00:30:06,014 --> 00:30:07,599
My sources were clear on this.

248
00:30:07,682 --> 00:30:09,809
Aeon Flux
is the best the Monicans have.

249
00:30:09,893 --> 00:30:12,645
- She failed.
- It's the first time she has.

250
00:30:13,396 --> 00:30:15,231
I wanted this done cleanly.

251
00:30:16,191 --> 00:30:18,985
- My brother...
- Will be vulnerable.

252
00:30:20,111 --> 00:30:21,529
Preparing his speech...

253
00:30:21,613 --> 00:30:23,740
Tomorrow, 1300...

254
00:30:26,075 --> 00:30:28,411
It can't be traced to you, in any case.

255
00:30:28,495 --> 00:30:29,996
That's comforting.

256
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:32,081
We did everything correctly.

257
00:30:32,165 --> 00:30:34,834
- She had her opportunity.
- And she stopped.

258
00:30:35,251 --> 00:30:36,419
Why?

259
00:30:38,296 --> 00:30:41,424
- I don't know.
- Image retrieval underway.

260
00:30:41,716 --> 00:30:44,010
It'll be too risky to call another hit.

261
00:30:44,093 --> 00:30:47,013
The Monicans may suspect
they are being used.

262
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,809
Stop.

263
00:30:54,103 --> 00:30:55,188
Oren?

264
00:30:56,147 --> 00:30:57,190
No.

265
00:30:59,108 --> 00:31:00,777
That's impossible.

266
00:31:13,915 --> 00:31:15,083
Claudius.

267
00:31:17,335 --> 00:31:20,797
- Why are you still here?
- It's not as simple as you think.

268
00:31:21,297 --> 00:31:24,425
Una is murdered and you keep working
for the people who did it?

269
00:31:24,509 --> 00:31:26,678
- What should I be thinking?
- You don't know.

270
00:31:26,761 --> 00:31:28,596
What don't I know?

271
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:30,765
They killed her.

272
00:31:31,307 --> 00:31:33,977
- And you're still alive.
- You killed her, Aeon.

273
00:31:34,352 --> 00:31:37,272
They thought she was a Monican,
that's why she died.

274
00:31:38,481 --> 00:31:41,818
- Una's life was worth more than that.
- She was all I had.

275
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,488
You're not the only one.

276
00:31:48,366 --> 00:31:51,119
What are you
really doing here, Claudius?

277
00:31:52,078 --> 00:31:53,329
Working.

278
00:31:54,664 --> 00:31:56,374
It's all that's left.

279
00:31:56,457 --> 00:31:58,835
Working. For Trevor Goodchild.

280
00:32:00,336 --> 00:32:02,005
I blamed him, too.

281
00:32:02,088 --> 00:32:04,382
But now
I don't think it was Trevor's fault.

282
00:32:04,465 --> 00:32:06,259
Trevor's trying to help.

283
00:32:06,342 --> 00:32:10,346
Something is wrong with us, Aeon.
With everybody.

284
00:32:11,514 --> 00:32:13,808
You have the dreams, don't you?

285
00:32:14,017 --> 00:32:16,728
Memories of things
that never happened to you?

286
00:32:16,811 --> 00:32:19,105
Una had them. I have them.

287
00:32:19,188 --> 00:32:21,274
It's happening all across Bregna.

288
00:32:21,357 --> 00:32:23,443
- What is it?
- I don't know.

289
00:32:23,651 --> 00:32:26,112
They only tell us what we need to know.

290
00:32:26,195 --> 00:32:28,865
My work is a small part
of a larger experiment.

291
00:32:28,948 --> 00:32:31,409
- Whose experiment?
- Trevor's.

292
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:35,204
We're studying
what's growing outside the wall.

293
00:32:35,663 --> 00:32:39,125
Something happened
when they cured the industrial disease.

294
00:32:39,208 --> 00:32:41,836
Something else sprung up in its place.

295
00:32:42,545 --> 00:32:43,880
We're sick.

296
00:32:44,797 --> 00:32:48,009
And Trevor's trying to cure us.
That's all I know.

297
00:32:52,722 --> 00:32:54,390
Trevor tried to dope me.

298
00:32:54,724 --> 00:32:56,351
Tell me what's in this.

299
00:33:03,733 --> 00:33:05,276
It's a message.

300
00:33:05,735 --> 00:33:07,362
Well, what does it say?

301
00:33:07,945 --> 00:33:10,740
You have to drink it.
That's how it works.

302
00:33:15,036 --> 00:33:16,412
I loved her.

303
00:33:19,791 --> 00:33:21,292
You know that.

304
00:33:41,437 --> 00:33:42,522
Aeon.

305
00:33:43,815 --> 00:33:47,985
I'm sorry for the pain,
but it's not safe to talk in the open.

306
00:33:48,986 --> 00:33:51,155
Nothing is as it seems.

307
00:33:53,533 --> 00:33:56,452
You had your chance.
Why did you hesitate?

308
00:34:00,456 --> 00:34:02,166
You know where to find me.

309
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:34,657
- Why am I here?
- I needed to see you again.

310
00:34:35,366 --> 00:34:37,160
You killed my sister.

311
00:34:37,744 --> 00:34:39,746
I didn't know anything about it.

312
00:34:40,538 --> 00:34:41,789
I'm sorry.

313
00:34:41,956 --> 00:34:44,083
- And that excuses you?
- No.

314
00:34:44,292 --> 00:34:47,128
But this is a war.
People on all sides die.

315
00:34:47,503 --> 00:34:50,840
She shouldn't have.
She had nothing to do with this.

316
00:34:51,674 --> 00:34:55,011
- Everyone is involved in this.
- She wasn't.

317
00:34:59,182 --> 00:35:01,142
I don't need that to kill you.

318
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:03,644
But it would be easier, wouldn't it?

319
00:35:07,565 --> 00:35:10,026
Everything changed when I saw you.

320
00:35:12,195 --> 00:35:14,363
I know you. And you know me.

321
00:35:16,616 --> 00:35:19,660
Why do I know you? Why?

322
00:35:22,455 --> 00:35:24,332
Why did you come back?

323
00:35:25,333 --> 00:35:28,211
- What do you want from me?
- What do I want?

324
00:35:28,503 --> 00:35:30,379
I want my sister back.

325
00:35:30,546 --> 00:35:33,841
I want to remember
what it feels like to be a person.

326
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:42,683
Aeon.

327
00:35:43,267 --> 00:35:45,728
Why do I feel this way around you?

328
00:36:46,998 --> 00:36:48,332
Katherine...

329
00:36:50,042 --> 00:36:51,210
You know me.

330
00:36:52,336 --> 00:36:54,171
I want you to eliminate him.

331
00:36:55,631 --> 00:36:56,716
Come back.

332
00:36:57,967 --> 00:37:00,344
I'm not who you think I am, Aeon.

333
00:40:00,232 --> 00:40:01,984
Something is missing here.

334
00:40:02,276 --> 00:40:06,238
We identified the variables
that compromised test group 7A.

335
00:40:06,322 --> 00:40:10,409
Schedule a Relical visit regarding 7B
and make sure we isolate them.

336
00:40:10,493 --> 00:40:11,911
It's just a matter of time

337
00:40:11,994 --> 00:40:15,247
before people look up
and question what's happening here.

338
00:40:45,361 --> 00:40:46,695
Found you.

339
00:42:51,695 --> 00:42:53,864
No permanent damage here, Chairman.

340
00:42:57,701 --> 00:42:59,203
You may leave.

341
00:43:03,332 --> 00:43:04,833
She's escaped.

342
00:43:05,334 --> 00:43:07,169
Why am I not surprised?

343
00:43:07,253 --> 00:43:09,213
I found her in the library.

344
00:43:09,296 --> 00:43:11,924
- I think I wounded her, but...
- You attacked her?

345
00:43:12,007 --> 00:43:14,426
She's a Monican agent
who tried to kill you.

346
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:16,553
I assumed it was obvious
what I should do.

347
00:43:16,637 --> 00:43:19,473
Freya, I want her alive.
Do you understand?

348
00:43:24,937 --> 00:43:26,814
Is Oren aware of this?

349
00:43:27,356 --> 00:43:28,983
I can't find him.

350
00:43:29,692 --> 00:43:31,068
Stay close.

351
00:43:37,449 --> 00:43:41,287
No matter what Trevor's done for us
in the past, he's not above reproach.

352
00:43:41,370 --> 00:43:42,955
This is treason.

353
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:45,874
Oren?

354
00:43:48,502 --> 00:43:51,797
Trevor has been moving away from us
for a long time.

355
00:43:52,256 --> 00:43:55,134
What we've built here
is larger than him.

356
00:43:58,304 --> 00:44:02,558
I never thought it would come to this,
but we have to face the truth.

357
00:44:03,767 --> 00:44:07,146
He chose that Monican
and he knew what that would mean.

358
00:44:07,229 --> 00:44:08,939
He must be removed.

359
00:44:09,023 --> 00:44:11,108
And Oren is next in line.

360
00:44:12,943 --> 00:44:14,570
Isn't that right?

361
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:17,406
Yes.

362
00:44:18,615 --> 00:44:20,159
It's done, then.

363
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:23,412
Mr Chairman.

364
00:44:26,206 --> 00:44:28,417
Trevor has betrayed all of us.

365
00:44:30,919 --> 00:44:32,546
He's a criminal.

366
00:44:33,672 --> 00:44:35,591
We'll treat him as one.

367
00:44:38,719 --> 00:44:40,471
...test group 7A.

368
00:44:40,554 --> 00:44:44,516
Schedule a Relical visit regarding 7B
and make sure we isolate them.

369
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:45,976
It's just a matter of time

370
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:49,271
before people look up
and question what's happening here.

371
00:44:51,523 --> 00:44:55,027
Re view progress of subjects
from test group 7B,

372
00:44:55,277 --> 00:44:58,781
Sandrin Veems, Greta Salk, Una Flux.

373
00:44:59,031 --> 00:45:02,034
Schedule a Relical visit
to retrieve new data.

374
00:45:02,117 --> 00:45:04,953
8.26, 7.19.

375
00:45:06,914 --> 00:45:09,083
Greta Salk, Una Flux.

376
00:45:09,249 --> 00:45:12,211
Schedule a Relical visit
to retrieve new data.

377
00:45:12,294 --> 00:45:15,172
8.26, 7.19.

378
00:45:17,299 --> 00:45:21,428
Collect additional samples
from Relical strands 5.88.

379
00:45:25,391 --> 00:45:27,935
You're certainly killing him kindly.

380
00:45:30,687 --> 00:45:32,773
The situation has changed.

381
00:45:32,856 --> 00:45:34,650
Our orders haven't.

382
00:45:35,317 --> 00:45:37,736
I'm not following orders any more.

383
00:45:38,654 --> 00:45:40,864
Why are you doing this, Aeon?

384
00:45:41,698 --> 00:45:43,784
Everything has become
more complicated.

385
00:45:43,867 --> 00:45:44,993
No, it's simple.

386
00:45:45,077 --> 00:45:47,204
Trevor may not be responsible
for Una's death.

387
00:45:47,287 --> 00:45:50,666
- Trevor?
- I'm trying to find out who is.

388
00:45:51,166 --> 00:45:55,629
Your mission was to kill Goodchild
and you can't or won't do that. So...

389
00:45:59,299 --> 00:46:01,760
Give me your weapon
and return across the frontier.

390
00:46:01,844 --> 00:46:06,140
- Didn't I teach you to think for yourself?
- You taught me a lot more than that.

391
00:46:08,183 --> 00:46:09,435
Please!

392
00:46:09,852 --> 00:46:12,020
I can hurt you if I have to.

393
00:46:12,813 --> 00:46:15,607
Don't you feel something wrong
inside you?

394
00:46:15,732 --> 00:46:17,401
Sithandra, I'm...

395
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,157
I don't know who I am.

396
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,328
You feel it, too, don't you?

397
00:46:29,746 --> 00:46:31,206
Come with me.

398
00:46:32,332 --> 00:46:34,751
We'll finish the mission together.

399
00:46:40,591 --> 00:46:41,842
I can't.

400
00:47:58,794 --> 00:48:00,921
This sort of thing used to be fun.

401
00:48:01,672 --> 00:48:03,715
Now what do I do with you?

402
00:48:45,007 --> 00:48:46,091
Katherine.

403
00:48:49,219 --> 00:48:50,554
Come back.

404
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:36,618
07.4.872.

405
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:39,955
Noted. Returned to stream.

406
00:50:41,331 --> 00:50:42,874
Gregor Plitzen.

407
00:50:44,251 --> 00:50:48,630
70.5.872.

408
00:50:49,297 --> 00:50:52,300
Noted. Returned to stream.

409
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:55,262
Suki Denali.

410
00:50:55,971 --> 00:51:00,684
02.4.875.

411
00:51:01,017 --> 00:51:03,687
Noted. Returned to stream.

412
00:51:10,402 --> 00:51:11,862
Welcome back.

413
00:51:50,567 --> 00:51:51,860
Una Flux.

414
00:51:52,611 --> 00:51:57,032
32.4.870.

415
00:51:57,741 --> 00:51:59,075
Collected.

416
00:52:02,162 --> 00:52:05,499
Successfully reassigned
as Sasha Prillo.

417
00:52:05,999 --> 00:52:07,209
Repeat.

418
00:52:08,293 --> 00:52:12,881
Una Flux. Reassigned as Sasha Prillo.

419
00:52:16,218 --> 00:52:18,553
Sasha Prillo. Address.

420
00:52:19,054 --> 00:52:22,474
Sasha Prillo. Address.

421
00:52:53,964 --> 00:52:55,173
Handler.

422
00:52:55,257 --> 00:52:56,591
Sithandra.

423
00:52:56,967 --> 00:52:59,010
Goodchild is still alive.

424
00:52:59,177 --> 00:53:00,595
Aeon failed?

425
00:53:01,221 --> 00:53:02,848
She let him live.

426
00:53:03,598 --> 00:53:05,892
There's something between them.

427
00:53:05,976 --> 00:53:08,144
Something personal.

428
00:53:08,603 --> 00:53:09,855
Explain.

429
00:53:10,272 --> 00:53:12,023
She abandoned the mission.

430
00:53:12,107 --> 00:53:15,735
I tried to stop her,
and she attacked me and left me here.

431
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:19,531
Are you secure where you are?

432
00:53:20,991 --> 00:53:22,200
Fairly.

433
00:53:23,285 --> 00:53:24,828
Help is coming.

434
00:53:25,245 --> 00:53:27,956
Aeon Flux is now considered a fugitive.

435
00:53:28,790 --> 00:53:32,377
She has betrayed the resistance
and must be considered a threat.

436
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:36,047
She has aligned herself with Goodchild
and is with him now.

437
00:53:36,131 --> 00:53:37,966
We must move quickly.

438
00:53:39,134 --> 00:53:41,052
You will eliminate her.

439
00:53:41,636 --> 00:53:44,347
Kill her and then complete her mission.

440
00:53:45,849 --> 00:53:48,351
Sithandra, show them where you are.

441
00:53:55,442 --> 00:53:56,818
Do you see?

442
00:53:58,069 --> 00:53:59,905
- Yes.
- Yes.

443
00:53:59,988 --> 00:54:01,114
Yes.

444
00:54:02,073 --> 00:54:04,701
Extricate her and proceed from there.

445
00:54:12,834 --> 00:54:14,002
Trevor?

446
00:54:27,265 --> 00:54:28,558
It's her.

447
00:54:29,184 --> 00:54:30,310
Yes.

448
00:54:31,686 --> 00:54:34,522
- She was here.
- What was she looking for?

449
00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:36,566
Her sister.

450
00:54:38,485 --> 00:54:39,527
Una.

451
00:54:54,876 --> 00:54:56,169
Una Flux.

452
00:54:58,630 --> 00:55:00,048
Scroll down.

453
00:55:00,548 --> 00:55:03,718
Member of test group 7B.

454
00:55:04,094 --> 00:55:05,887
Show me all of 7B.

455
00:55:08,014 --> 00:55:09,724
Sandrin Veems.

456
00:55:10,225 --> 00:55:12,519
Member of 7B.

457
00:55:12,978 --> 00:55:15,188
Killed in police action.

458
00:55:18,441 --> 00:55:19,651
Where is she?

459
00:55:19,734 --> 00:55:21,152
Greta Salk.

460
00:55:21,611 --> 00:55:24,114
Member of 7B.

461
00:55:24,531 --> 00:55:26,574
Killed in police action.

462
00:55:26,741 --> 00:55:28,535
There's nobody here.

463
00:55:29,911 --> 00:55:31,579
Camille Abdi.

464
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:34,416
Member of 7B.

465
00:55:35,166 --> 00:55:37,252
Killed in police action.

466
00:55:45,593 --> 00:55:46,928
Una Flux.

467
00:55:47,303 --> 00:55:49,556
Member of 7B.

468
00:55:50,598 --> 00:55:52,809
Killed in police action.

469
00:56:07,198 --> 00:56:08,658
Who did this?

470
00:56:08,742 --> 00:56:13,288
All actions authorised
by Adjunct Chairman Oren Goodchild.

471
00:56:15,290 --> 00:56:18,877
Freya, go to my lab,
find the notes from group 7B.

472
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:21,796
You need to get to a safe place.
They're moving against you.

473
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:24,340
- Meet me there in two hours.
- Where are you going?

474
00:56:24,424 --> 00:56:26,885
- I have to find her before they do.
- Trevor...

475
00:56:26,968 --> 00:56:29,304
Freya, I'll see you at the lab.

476
00:56:30,096 --> 00:56:31,973
Take care of yourself.

477
00:56:40,899 --> 00:56:42,067
Una.

478
00:56:43,193 --> 00:56:44,652
You're right.

479
00:56:48,531 --> 00:56:51,242
- Please don't hurt my baby.
- She's safe.

480
00:56:53,453 --> 00:56:54,996
You cloned her?

481
00:56:55,830 --> 00:56:57,582
I cloned everybody.

482
00:56:59,918 --> 00:57:03,797
There was a complication
when we cured the industrial disease.

483
00:57:05,465 --> 00:57:08,259
The vaccine had
an unintended side effect.

484
00:57:10,261 --> 00:57:11,596
Sterility.

485
00:57:12,347 --> 00:57:15,809
Only one more generation
of our species could survive.

486
00:57:16,768 --> 00:57:18,269
It was a desperate time.

487
00:57:18,353 --> 00:57:19,771
It's our responsibility...

488
00:57:19,854 --> 00:57:23,399
Cloning had never been used
on humans successfully.

489
00:57:27,987 --> 00:57:29,614
But we succeeded.

490
00:57:31,950 --> 00:57:35,995
Now, when a person dies,
their DNA is recycled.

491
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:39,124
Oren and I built the Relical
to store the DNA

492
00:57:39,207 --> 00:57:41,209
and conceal the cloning process.

493
00:57:41,543 --> 00:57:44,295
The Keeper finds a suitable couple

494
00:57:44,879 --> 00:57:48,508
and, using food additives,
we induce a chemical pregnancy.

495
00:57:50,218 --> 00:57:54,222
When the woman comes in for an exam,
we implant a cloned embryo.

496
00:57:54,597 --> 00:57:56,766
From there, things happen naturally.

497
00:57:57,267 --> 00:58:01,104
In nine months,
a citizen who died is reborn.

498
00:58:03,481 --> 00:58:06,943
For seven generations,
Oren and I have cloned ourselves,

499
00:58:07,026 --> 00:58:10,905
taught ourselves, so that
I could keep trying to find a cure

500
00:58:12,824 --> 00:58:14,659
while we all live on.

501
00:58:19,539 --> 00:58:21,291
That's what we are?

502
00:58:22,458 --> 00:58:23,668
Copies?

503
00:58:24,836 --> 00:58:26,629
We're more than that.

504
00:58:30,633 --> 00:58:33,136
It wasn't supposed to be permanent.

505
00:58:36,097 --> 00:58:38,933
I've been trying to cure the infertility.

506
00:58:42,228 --> 00:58:44,856
Una was part of one of my test groups.

507
00:58:45,481 --> 00:58:47,108
Oren lied to me.

508
00:58:47,358 --> 00:58:50,445
He told me her test had failed
like the others.

509
00:58:51,112 --> 00:58:53,281
But she had become pregnant.

510
00:58:56,534 --> 00:58:58,870
He killed all of the subjects.

511
00:58:59,704 --> 00:59:01,497
Your sister included.

512
00:59:04,125 --> 00:59:06,794
He killed her
because she was pregnant.

513
00:59:11,841 --> 00:59:13,593
Una didn't know it

514
00:59:14,135 --> 00:59:18,431
but her baby would've been one
of the first new children in 400 years.

515
00:59:20,558 --> 00:59:22,101
Oren's changed.

516
00:59:23,645 --> 00:59:26,898
He doesn't want to go back.
He doesn't want a cure.

517
00:59:27,815 --> 00:59:29,817
He wants to live forever.

518
00:59:39,202 --> 00:59:42,914
You must've been expecting this
after helping that Monican.

519
00:59:45,375 --> 00:59:48,544
Your loyalty to Trevor
can't protect you any more.

520
00:59:48,670 --> 00:59:51,714
I'm loyal to something deeper
than any of this.

521
00:59:52,674 --> 00:59:55,426
I don't understand
people like you and Trevor.

522
00:59:55,510 --> 00:59:58,680
Your sentimentality,
your devotion to the past,

523
00:59:59,639 --> 01:00:01,307
to things that are gone.

524
01:00:01,391 --> 01:00:04,018
I couldn't live without those things.

525
01:00:04,686 --> 01:00:06,104
How can you?

526
01:00:24,289 --> 01:00:25,456
Sasha.

527
01:00:26,916 --> 01:00:30,295
We should go.
It won't take long for Oren to find us.

528
01:00:34,590 --> 01:00:36,592
She's gonna be a handful.

529
01:00:40,513 --> 01:00:42,056
Go. They don't want you.

530
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:43,224
Go!

531
01:03:41,235 --> 01:03:42,403
Down!

532
01:03:58,794 --> 01:04:01,088
No. You need to stay conscious.

533
01:04:10,264 --> 01:04:11,933
Please remain calm.

534
01:04:12,892 --> 01:04:15,728
We are experiencing
a technical malfunction.

535
01:04:18,439 --> 01:04:20,233
Please remain calm.

536
01:04:21,067 --> 01:04:23,986
We are experiencing
a technical malfunction.

537
01:04:25,488 --> 01:04:27,406
Please remain calm.

538
01:04:27,990 --> 01:04:29,951
We are experiencing...

539
01:04:41,629 --> 01:04:44,173
We can't go to a Monican safe house.

540
01:04:44,340 --> 01:04:46,634
Nowhere's going to be safe for us.

541
01:05:02,525 --> 01:05:04,819
We need to get the bullets out.

542
01:05:42,189 --> 01:05:44,191
Are you hit anywhere else?

543
01:05:49,363 --> 01:05:51,907
Did any of them manage to miss you?

544
01:06:11,385 --> 01:06:13,971
We might have to go outside the wall.

545
01:06:15,181 --> 01:06:16,390
I know.

546
01:06:19,226 --> 01:06:21,228
First, I have to end this.

547
01:06:25,066 --> 01:06:26,901
I need to go back in.

548
01:06:27,109 --> 01:06:30,071
I have to get my notes
from Una's test group.

549
01:06:30,696 --> 01:06:35,034
Oren will find the lab and destroy it,
everything I've done.

550
01:06:50,758 --> 01:06:52,843
All military units should report
to their stations

551
01:06:53,386 --> 01:06:55,513
and wait for further instructions.

552
01:07:02,853 --> 01:07:04,689
Who's in charge here?

553
01:07:06,065 --> 01:07:07,441
We need your help.

554
01:07:07,525 --> 01:07:10,069
- We have orders to shoot you on sight.
- There's been a coup.

555
01:07:10,152 --> 01:07:12,947
Your orders are coming
from an illegitimate government.

556
01:07:13,030 --> 01:07:15,950
- Stay where you are, sir!
- What's your name?

557
01:07:16,367 --> 01:07:18,619
- Sir?
- I want to know your name.

558
01:07:20,121 --> 01:07:22,748
It's Ord. Garret Ord.

559
01:07:23,249 --> 01:07:26,877
I can't command you any more, Garret.
But neither can they.

560
01:07:27,420 --> 01:07:28,879
You're free.

561
01:07:29,630 --> 01:07:31,799
You need to make a decision.

562
01:07:35,261 --> 01:07:37,972
Shoot us or help us, but do it quickly.

563
01:07:39,390 --> 01:07:40,766
Lieutenant?

564
01:07:49,150 --> 01:07:51,819
How can I help you,
Chairman Goodchild?

565
01:07:55,156 --> 01:07:57,908
We need weapons.
We need to get back into the Citadel.

566
01:07:57,992 --> 01:07:59,285
Yes, sir.

567
01:08:09,336 --> 01:08:13,340
Attention. Please return to your home
and wait for further instructions.

568
01:08:13,424 --> 01:08:15,134
You will be updated frequently.

569
01:08:15,217 --> 01:08:19,305
This is an announcement from the
Council and Chairman Oren Goodchild.

570
01:08:21,348 --> 01:08:25,561
Attention. Please return to your home
and wait for further instructions.

571
01:08:29,523 --> 01:08:31,692
- We're getting closer.
- Wait.

572
01:08:51,629 --> 01:08:52,880
Trevor.

573
01:08:55,216 --> 01:08:57,218
The name you called me...

574
01:09:00,095 --> 01:09:01,430
Katherine.

575
01:09:02,681 --> 01:09:04,308
That was my name.

576
01:09:07,853 --> 01:09:09,480
You were my wife.

577
01:09:14,026 --> 01:09:17,071
We had a life together,
just like anybody else.

578
01:09:17,530 --> 01:09:18,614
Wait.

579
01:09:19,907 --> 01:09:21,659
You need to tell me.

580
01:09:23,786 --> 01:09:27,748
I lost you during the disease,
and you couldn't be brought back.

581
01:09:28,290 --> 01:09:31,418
I've lived and died
seven times since then.

582
01:09:33,170 --> 01:09:35,881
And each time
I taught myself about you.

583
01:09:36,632 --> 01:09:38,884
You were an idea I kept alive.

584
01:09:39,343 --> 01:09:41,428
Something I had to imagine.

585
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:48,435
But when I saw you,

586
01:09:51,272 --> 01:09:53,107
what I felt was real.

587
01:09:53,941 --> 01:09:55,359
I knew you.

588
01:09:57,152 --> 01:09:58,779
I remembered you.

589
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:03,284
What we had then survived in us
past death, past everything.

590
01:10:05,494 --> 01:10:07,371
I was looking for you.

591
01:10:08,622 --> 01:10:10,291
I've been waiting.

592
01:10:11,876 --> 01:10:13,878
We were different people.

593
01:10:14,670 --> 01:10:15,921
We were.

594
01:10:16,672 --> 01:10:18,465
Those people are gone.

595
01:10:20,217 --> 01:10:22,553
But something in them came back.

596
01:10:23,804 --> 01:10:24,847
Yes.

597
01:10:40,654 --> 01:10:41,989
I remember.

598
01:10:44,533 --> 01:10:46,327
It's chaos out there.

599
01:10:46,410 --> 01:10:48,412
There's a coup against Goodchild.

600
01:10:48,495 --> 01:10:50,497
Made it easier to slip in.

601
01:10:50,664 --> 01:10:52,082
Did you bring a way to find her?

602
01:10:52,166 --> 01:10:55,294
As long as there's a trace of the pill
in her, we can track her.

603
01:11:05,679 --> 01:11:06,764
No.

604
01:11:25,616 --> 01:11:26,825
Freya.

605
01:11:32,998 --> 01:11:34,333
It's gone.

606
01:11:36,543 --> 01:11:38,087
I had cured it.

607
01:11:38,295 --> 01:11:40,214
I'd found the answer.

608
01:11:40,714 --> 01:11:42,216
It's all gone.

609
01:11:45,177 --> 01:11:47,054
We have to keep moving.

610
01:11:56,021 --> 01:11:58,524
There's still one more thing to do.

611
01:11:59,024 --> 01:12:02,861
There's nothing left to do.
You and I need to get out of here.

612
01:12:03,821 --> 01:12:07,032
We go outside the wall.
We'll find a way to live.

613
01:12:07,116 --> 01:12:10,703
There's one more thing to do.
I need to destroy it.

614
01:12:11,453 --> 01:12:12,496
No.

615
01:12:15,082 --> 01:12:16,750
This isn't the answer, Aeon.

616
01:12:16,834 --> 01:12:19,211
There's no guarantee
I can find the cure again.

617
01:12:19,294 --> 01:12:22,339
- The cloning is all we have.
- It's not enough.

618
01:12:22,881 --> 01:12:26,552
Our minds are unravelling, and every
time you bring us back it gets worse.

619
01:12:26,635 --> 01:12:28,595
If you do this, we end.

620
01:12:29,054 --> 01:12:30,806
We're meant to die.

621
01:12:32,349 --> 01:12:35,102
It's what makes
anything about us matter.

622
01:12:37,354 --> 01:12:39,440
Living like this is torture.

623
01:12:39,523 --> 01:12:41,233
We're just ghosts.

624
01:12:43,193 --> 01:12:44,862
That's not how I feel.

625
01:12:47,114 --> 01:12:48,240
Not now.

626
01:12:56,290 --> 01:12:57,958
Let's be careful.

627
01:12:58,375 --> 01:13:00,627
You know who we're up against.

628
01:13:07,009 --> 01:13:10,054
- This is an empty gesture.
- It's a leap of faith.

629
01:13:10,137 --> 01:13:12,264
It's not for you to decide.

630
01:13:13,182 --> 01:13:16,727
Aeon, I don't want to lose you again.

631
01:13:18,145 --> 01:13:19,813
You don't have to.

632
01:13:21,023 --> 01:13:23,150
You'll find the cure again.

633
01:13:24,485 --> 01:13:26,153
It's over, Trevor.

634
01:13:33,827 --> 01:13:36,413
Moving into position on the south spire.

635
01:13:39,166 --> 01:13:41,835
It goes so much deeper than your cure.

636
01:13:42,336 --> 01:13:45,005
Other women have been
getting pregnant naturally,

637
01:13:45,089 --> 01:13:47,216
outside of your experiments.

638
01:13:47,382 --> 01:13:49,259
More and more of them.

639
01:13:50,344 --> 01:13:52,262
They healed themselves.

640
01:13:53,222 --> 01:13:56,183
- And you killed them, too?
- I had to stop it.

641
01:13:57,017 --> 01:13:58,352
How many?

642
01:14:02,773 --> 01:14:04,024
How many, Oren?

643
01:14:04,733 --> 01:14:08,028
It doesn't matter.
Nature's finally found a way.

644
01:14:11,323 --> 01:14:13,117
- In position.
- In position.

645
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:14,535
Position acquired.

646
01:14:14,868 --> 01:14:17,871
Nature's the one who's obsolete, not us.

647
01:14:19,081 --> 01:14:23,335
How can you not understand
the beauty of what you made? I do.

648
01:14:24,628 --> 01:14:26,672
Situation's getting complicated.

649
01:14:33,095 --> 01:14:35,264
You told me she was gone.

650
01:14:39,726 --> 01:14:42,020
There was nothing that they could do.

651
01:14:45,232 --> 01:14:47,401
I ordered her DNA destroyed.

652
01:14:48,902 --> 01:14:51,321
You were a different man
with her, Trevor.

653
01:14:51,405 --> 01:14:54,658
She would've stopped you
from doing what needed to be done.

654
01:14:55,742 --> 01:14:57,661
- Like she's stopping you now.
- No, Oren.

655
01:14:57,744 --> 01:14:58,787
Yes.

656
01:14:59,079 --> 01:15:00,998
- Waiting for the go.
- On my signal.

657
01:15:01,081 --> 01:15:03,333
This world, our world, is beautiful.

658
01:15:03,917 --> 01:15:06,086
Worth preserving at any cost.

659
01:15:06,170 --> 01:15:08,589
It can't last. It's falling apart.

660
01:15:12,467 --> 01:15:14,428
Sithandra, give us the signal.

661
01:15:16,346 --> 01:15:18,724
- Sithandra.
- Take Flux down first.

662
01:15:18,807 --> 01:15:19,933
You're wrong in this, Oren.

663
01:15:20,017 --> 01:15:22,436
We've beaten death, beaten nature.

664
01:15:23,604 --> 01:15:25,314
We've gone beyond you.

665
01:15:25,939 --> 01:15:28,025
And now I need to be free of you.

666
01:15:38,243 --> 01:15:39,328
Wait.

667
01:15:52,299 --> 01:15:53,675
Sithandra.

668
01:15:57,930 --> 01:16:00,724
You chose this, Aeon. It's too late.

669
01:16:01,058 --> 01:16:03,101
You know how much we're all suffering.

670
01:16:03,185 --> 01:16:05,604
I'm trying to end it, and so is Trevor.

671
01:16:06,188 --> 01:16:08,148
I would never betray you.

672
01:16:08,732 --> 01:16:09,983
Help me.

673
01:16:12,110 --> 01:16:13,487
Sithandra.

674
01:16:14,613 --> 01:16:16,281
You still know me.

675
01:16:16,365 --> 01:16:17,741
Finish it.

676
01:16:18,617 --> 01:16:20,702
You can choose to trust me.

677
01:16:25,499 --> 01:16:26,541
Finish it.

678
01:16:26,625 --> 01:16:28,252
I'm sorry, Oren.

679
01:16:28,460 --> 01:16:29,544
I'm sorry.

680
01:16:29,628 --> 01:16:30,796
I am, too.

681
01:16:35,717 --> 01:16:38,971
Orders have changed.
Cover Aeon. Cover Goodchild.

682
01:17:21,513 --> 01:17:23,056
Goodchild's been hit.

683
01:17:27,394 --> 01:17:29,396
Flux is headed to the courtyard.

684
01:17:32,899 --> 01:17:34,234
Cover Aeon.

685
01:18:58,026 --> 01:18:59,403
Sithandra!

686
01:19:50,620 --> 01:19:51,746
Oren.

687
01:20:25,530 --> 01:20:27,073
They're coming.

688
01:20:32,204 --> 01:20:33,413
Aeon.

689
01:20:53,433 --> 01:20:55,644
We're waiting for your orders.

690
01:20:56,102 --> 01:20:58,104
You're not part of this?

691
01:20:59,064 --> 01:21:01,691
Whatever we are, we're not anarchists.

692
01:21:02,067 --> 01:21:04,611
- There have to be rules.
- Thank you.

693
01:21:36,643 --> 01:21:38,186
You're the one.

694
01:21:38,937 --> 01:21:40,397
You saved me.

695
01:21:40,981 --> 01:21:42,023
Yes.

696
01:21:43,191 --> 01:21:44,818
I knew you then.

697
01:21:45,151 --> 01:21:47,821
This one was corrupted. Destroy it.

698
01:21:48,321 --> 01:21:50,323
I knew you were important.

699
01:21:50,991 --> 01:21:52,576
The DNA is good.

700
01:21:52,659 --> 01:21:53,994
Destroy it.

701
01:21:59,916 --> 01:22:02,502
I knew that I needed to protect you.

702
01:22:04,254 --> 01:22:08,383
I kept your DNA hidden here, dormant.

703
01:22:09,009 --> 01:22:11,720
I've waited until now to bring you back.

704
01:22:12,012 --> 01:22:13,096
Why?

705
01:22:13,346 --> 01:22:18,268
I knew that your strength
would survive with you.

706
01:22:18,602 --> 01:22:22,439
I thought that if I brought you back,
you could reach Trevor.

707
01:22:23,857 --> 01:22:25,525
You always could.

708
01:22:26,776 --> 01:22:29,738
- I have to end it.
- Yes.

709
01:22:30,822 --> 01:22:32,115
Start over.

710
01:22:32,949 --> 01:22:34,534
What about you?

711
01:22:36,411 --> 01:22:39,664
I've waited 400 years for this day.

712
01:22:43,209 --> 01:22:44,544
I'm tired.

713
01:22:52,052 --> 01:22:53,678
Stay alive, Aeon.

714
01:22:55,805 --> 01:22:57,390
You are needed.

715
01:23:49,567 --> 01:23:50,819
Look!

716
01:24:58,344 --> 01:25:00,388
Now we can move forward

717
01:25:01,514 --> 01:25:05,018
to live once for real

718
01:25:06,936 --> 01:25:11,691
and then give way to people
who might do it better.

719
01:25:19,365 --> 01:25:21,117
Hey, Katherine.

720
01:25:24,871 --> 01:25:26,706
Will I see you again?

721
01:25:37,383 --> 01:25:39,135
To live only once

722
01:25:44,390 --> 01:25:45,934
but with hope.
