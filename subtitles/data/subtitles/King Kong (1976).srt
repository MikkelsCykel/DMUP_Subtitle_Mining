SURABAYA
INDONESIA

2
00:01:01,776 --> 00:01:06,947
-OK Boan, how much you got here?
-About 1,800.

3
00:01:07,198 --> 00:01:10,117
-What's going on?
-There's Bagley.

4
00:01:10,368 --> 00:01:16,540
Mr. Bagley! Something haywire.
We haven't loaded enough pipe.

5
00:01:16,791 --> 00:01:20,628
-Less than 2,000 feet.
-That'll be enough.

6
00:01:20,836 --> 00:01:26,926
On Huangatan, it didn't come
until we were past 26,000 feet.

7
00:01:27,134 --> 00:01:31,180
This hole proves out within 2,000,
or it's a write-off.

8
00:01:52,034 --> 00:01:54,578
How are you this evening?

9
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,584
All right.

10
00:02:11,804 --> 00:02:16,684
The barometer is still falling.
It's a lousy forecast all right.

11
00:02:16,934 --> 00:02:20,563
We should stay here
another 48 hours.

12
00:02:20,813 --> 00:02:25,192
Every hour we delay gives others
a chance of beating us to the island.

13
00:02:25,401 --> 00:02:28,487
-I thought only we knew...
-We'll sail right away.

14
00:02:28,738 --> 00:02:31,991
You'll be sorry.

15
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:35,953
All right, Mr. Carnahan,
ready to let go.

16
00:02:36,203 --> 00:02:42,209
-Stand by fore and aft.
-OK, haul the gangway ashore!

17
00:03:17,286 --> 00:03:20,206
Let it go.

18
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:31,217
-Roy.
-Fred.

19
00:03:32,843 --> 00:03:37,306
Well, here's to the big one.

20
00:03:52,822 --> 00:03:58,035
MAIN TITLE

21
00:06:04,578 --> 00:06:08,416
<i>Mayday, mayday.</i>

22
00:06:09,834 --> 00:06:13,254
<i>Mayday.</i>

23
00:06:28,978 --> 00:06:32,481
I'm reminded of Amsterdam.

24
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:38,696
Ever eat a raw herring with a beer
chaser and a scoop of ice cream?

25
00:06:54,003 --> 00:06:58,466
<i>-Captain here.
-I picked up a mayday call.</i>

26
00:06:58,674 --> 00:07:02,887
<i>-It faded before I couId get a fix.
-Keep listening.</i>

27
00:07:03,095 --> 00:07:06,599
Let me know if you get anything.

28
00:07:12,355 --> 00:07:16,484
Like you said:
"The hell with the weather."

29
00:07:20,655 --> 00:07:25,117
We can get out of this
by backtracking around Timor.

30
00:07:25,326 --> 00:07:29,955
-It'll only cost us a few days.
-Keep on course, I'm fine.

31
00:07:34,043 --> 00:07:38,589
I gotta admit, for a New York
desk guy, you got a lot of guts.

32
00:07:38,798 --> 00:07:42,301
I sold this one to the board.

33
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:47,932
If that island doesn't produce huge,
I'll be wiping windshields.

34
00:08:01,237 --> 00:08:05,449
Men.
Carnahan.

35
00:08:10,746 --> 00:08:15,710
I'd have told you earlier,
but I couldn't risk any talk.

36
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:24,010
Men, we may be sailing into
the history books. Hit the lights.

37
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:30,099
I believe we're headed for
the biggest oil strike ever.

38
00:08:30,349 --> 00:08:34,228
-Here in the magic circle.
-It's magic all right.

39
00:08:34,478 --> 00:08:38,774
Are we supposed to find oil
under 2,000 fathoms of sea?

40
00:08:39,025 --> 00:08:45,323
Just sea is what the charts say.
Now let's take a look a low angle.

41
00:08:46,741 --> 00:08:50,244
This was taken in 1943.

42
00:08:50,453 --> 00:08:54,582
This wake was left by the ship
that took the photograph.

43
00:08:54,832 --> 00:09:00,838
No sign of land. Here's a fog bank
you wouldn't look at twice.

44
00:09:01,088 --> 00:09:04,342
Let's look at another picture.

45
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:08,596
This is taken from precisely
the same angle.

46
00:09:08,846 --> 00:09:13,059
Same area, same fog bank.

47
00:09:15,561 --> 00:09:21,150
This was taken two weeks ago.
35 years later.

48
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:26,822
A bank of fog that doesn't change
a wisp in 35 years. Fantastic.

49
00:09:27,031 --> 00:09:31,160
Still nothing to explore,
except for one reason.

50
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:35,956
A spy satellite photographed it
by mistake.

51
00:09:36,207 --> 00:09:42,463
I got hold of the classified pictures
via a donation to someone.

52
00:09:42,713 --> 00:09:46,926
No names, but he lives
on Pennsylvania Ave.

53
00:09:47,176 --> 00:09:49,762
OK, fellas.

54
00:09:50,012 --> 00:09:54,558
Roy Bagley, would you take over
and let science make the point?

55
00:10:01,524 --> 00:10:07,113
The satellite was to analyse
exhaust gases from a missile test.

56
00:10:07,321 --> 00:10:11,617
So it was loaded with
two special kinds of film.

57
00:10:11,826 --> 00:10:15,579
No, first the infrared.

58
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:22,086
The different colors represent
different surface temperatures.

59
00:10:22,294 --> 00:10:26,090
-You mean there's land there?
-Correct, Joe.

60
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:30,219
An island,
hidden by a perpetual fog bank.

61
00:10:30,469 --> 00:10:35,516
Never seen by human eye
nor walked by human foot.

62
00:10:36,809 --> 00:10:41,439
The infrared patterns aren't like
any I've ever seen.

63
00:10:41,689 --> 00:10:46,319
More surprising, though, is
what the spectrograph picked up.

64
00:10:46,569 --> 00:10:50,531
Chemical composition
of our mysterious fog bank.

65
00:10:50,781 --> 00:10:56,704
Free hydrocarbon radicals,
excess nitrogen, carbon dioxide.

66
00:10:56,912 --> 00:11:00,958
And, not poisonous
but very damn curious...

67
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:06,964
This has to be caused by vapors
seeping up through the ground.

68
00:11:07,173 --> 00:11:11,218
-Vapors from petroleum deposits.
-Yes!

69
00:11:11,469 --> 00:11:17,642
That island is the tip of a huge
underground tankjust waiting for us.

70
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:22,229
-I'm betting everything I've got.
-I'll take 50 cents of that.

71
00:11:22,438 --> 00:11:27,652
The excess CO2 might also be
accounted for by animal respiration.

72
00:11:27,902 --> 00:11:32,448
-Turn the lights on.
-Animal breathing.

73
00:11:32,698 --> 00:11:34,659
Are you crazy?

74
00:11:34,867 --> 00:11:40,623
And I'm not so sure human feet
have never walked the island before.

75
00:11:40,873 --> 00:11:46,879
In 1605, Fernando De Queres
was blown south from Tenotang.

76
00:11:47,129 --> 00:11:52,718
He wrote of the piercing the
white veil. That's the cloud bank.

77
00:11:52,969 --> 00:11:56,681
And landing on the beach of the skull,
where he heard the roar -

78
00:11:56,931 --> 00:12:00,977
-of the greatest beast...

79
00:12:01,185 --> 00:12:06,941
The rest of that log entry
was suppressed by Rome.

80
00:12:07,191 --> 00:12:12,238
In 1749, a water-Iogged lifeboat
was found in the same area.

81
00:12:12,488 --> 00:12:18,411
It was empty,
but drawn in blood on the port -

82
00:12:18,619 --> 00:12:25,668
-was a likeness of a huge,
slouchy humanoid thing.

83
00:12:25,918 --> 00:12:28,504
And this strange warning:

84
00:12:30,798 --> 00:12:35,261
"From thy wedding with the creature
who touches heaven, lady, -

85
00:12:35,469 --> 00:12:39,932
-God preserve thee."

86
00:12:40,141 --> 00:12:46,230
I also heard of a note in a bottle
from a dying Japanese in 1944...

87
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,151
What the hell are you talking about?
Who is this joker?

88
00:12:50,359 --> 00:12:53,779
-Beats me.
-He's wearing a crew jersey.

89
00:12:53,988 --> 00:12:56,824
I'll pay any fair amount
for my... passage.

90
00:12:57,033 --> 00:13:00,202
-You're a stowaway?
-Jack Prescott. From Princeton.

91
00:13:00,453 --> 00:13:03,539
-Dept. Of Primate Paleonthology.
-You lying hippie!

92
00:13:03,748 --> 00:13:08,544
You're from another oil company!
The meeting's over.

93
00:13:08,753 --> 00:13:12,673
He's got one of our T-shirts.

94
00:13:18,638 --> 00:13:23,017
This doesn't mean a thing. Gulf
or Exxon can fix a fake passport.

95
00:13:23,225 --> 00:13:26,896
-Who the hell are you?
-I am Jack Prescott...

96
00:13:27,146 --> 00:13:34,278
My interest in your island
has got nothing to do with oil.

97
00:13:34,528 --> 00:13:38,658
You're not even a good liar. You
couldn't find out where we're going.

98
00:13:38,908 --> 00:13:45,164
-You bought charts!
-Come on. Who'd you pay off?

99
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:52,797
They hadn't sold charts for this area
in years. A friend tipped me.

100
00:13:53,005 --> 00:13:57,635
I did pick up
some charts in Surabaya.

101
00:13:57,885 --> 00:14:03,724
Take this spy below till he's hungry
enough to stop spouting ape shit.

102
00:14:03,933 --> 00:14:07,186
Let's go. Come on.

103
00:14:18,698 --> 00:14:22,493
-There's something out there.
-Oh, come on!

104
00:14:22,743 --> 00:14:26,789
-Honest to God, look!
-Quit horsing around.

105
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:31,002
Come back here!

106
00:14:31,252 --> 00:14:36,257
There's something out there!
About 2 o'clock. Use your glasses.

107
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:40,386
Son of a bitch, it's a raft!

108
00:15:02,575 --> 00:15:05,244
All stop.

109
00:15:38,319 --> 00:15:40,988
She's alive!

110
00:15:56,003 --> 00:15:58,589
Gently.

111
00:16:01,592 --> 00:16:06,722
I've had first-aid training, Captain.
Will you all clear out of here?

112
00:16:06,973 --> 00:16:09,642
-You have to undress her, huh?
-It's usual.

113
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:14,146
In case of internal injury
or shock syndrome.

114
00:16:14,355 --> 00:16:17,525
-Get outta here!
-Clear out.

115
00:16:27,702 --> 00:16:31,539
Eye Magnate. Beverly Hills.

116
00:16:31,789 --> 00:16:36,502
There's no sign of
injuries anywhere.

117
00:16:38,212 --> 00:16:43,342
C-Y-N-A-R-A. Sounds like a yacht.

118
00:16:43,592 --> 00:16:49,265
-Careless yachtsman, to lose this.
-Remember that mayday call?

119
00:16:55,688 --> 00:16:59,984
You can stop sweating. Navy
record's clean, it all checks out.

120
00:17:00,192 --> 00:17:03,446
Fingerprints.
The guy's kosher.

121
00:17:05,072 --> 00:17:08,993
I know just how to use him, too.

122
00:17:11,954 --> 00:17:18,377
The girl's about to come to. She
could be hysterical, so follow me.

123
00:17:22,006 --> 00:17:28,346
-Can I get a cheeseburger here?
-You went to medical school, right?

124
00:17:28,554 --> 00:17:32,475
What have you got, crystal balls?

125
00:17:32,725 --> 00:17:35,728
There's nothing I haven't checked.

126
00:17:35,936 --> 00:17:39,690
I know the day and hour
you completed your toilet training.

127
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:44,320
Now we gotta figure a way for you
to work off your room and board.

128
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:50,993
-You're pretty good with a camera.
-I've snapped a few monkeys.

129
00:17:51,243 --> 00:17:56,290
Congratulations.
You're now our official photographer.

130
00:18:23,734 --> 00:18:26,988
Hello. Everything's fine.

131
00:18:27,238 --> 00:18:31,784
You're safe and well
on an American merchant vessel.

132
00:18:35,287 --> 00:18:38,624
Where's Harry and everyone?

133
00:18:45,214 --> 00:18:50,886
-You mean they're gone?
-Do you remember anything?

134
00:18:54,682 --> 00:18:58,352
No. No.

135
00:19:04,108 --> 00:19:07,111
Yeah...

136
00:19:09,447 --> 00:19:12,700
I was on deck and then...

137
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:18,456
-Then I was swimming to a star.
-To a light.

138
00:19:18,706 --> 00:19:22,209
Let her call it a star.

139
00:19:22,418 --> 00:19:28,007
The life-raft was blown over board
near you. It had an automatic flare.

140
00:19:28,257 --> 00:19:31,886
I'm Fred Wilson, I'm in charge.

141
00:19:32,136 --> 00:19:36,265
The yacht didn't get very far
after the SOS.

142
00:19:36,515 --> 00:19:42,521
The radio reported that someone
found a piece of charred hull.

143
00:19:43,606 --> 00:19:47,193
We're sorry, ma'am.

144
00:19:48,986 --> 00:19:52,156
So am I.

145
00:19:54,158 --> 00:19:57,662
Harry had discovered me.

146
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:05,002
He was going to put me in a movie
he was making in Hong Kong.

147
00:20:05,252 --> 00:20:08,339
Dumb luck.

148
00:20:09,882 --> 00:20:13,928
But I guess I really can't complain.

149
00:20:15,346 --> 00:20:21,268
When you're alone adrift
in the Pacific and somebody just...

150
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:26,607
-Who spotted me, by the way?
-That young fellow.

151
00:20:30,778 --> 00:20:33,781
How can I ever thank you?

152
00:20:37,326 --> 00:20:40,746
I'm Dwan.

153
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:49,213
D-W-A-N. That's my name.
Like Dawn, -

154
00:20:49,463 --> 00:20:55,303
-except that I switched two letters
to make it more memorable.

155
00:20:55,553 --> 00:21:00,683
-I'm a mere Jack.
-You must be kidding.

156
00:21:00,933 --> 00:21:06,939
How could anybody
who saved my life be mere to me?

157
00:21:07,148 --> 00:21:10,568
You need some rest.

158
00:21:10,818 --> 00:21:15,906
I haven't had a good one of those
in years.

159
00:21:18,367 --> 00:21:22,663
-Are we headed back to Singapore?
-Not directly, ma'am.

160
00:21:28,586 --> 00:21:34,258
I guess it doesn't matter.
I'm in no rush.

161
00:21:37,511 --> 00:21:42,767
Harry probably wouldn't have
put me in that movie anyhow.

162
00:21:48,439 --> 00:21:51,859
Oh, my God!

163
00:21:54,904 --> 00:21:58,824
What a meaningful miracle!

164
00:21:59,075 --> 00:22:03,454
-I owe my life to a movie.
-Is that so?

165
00:22:03,663 --> 00:22:06,832
I swear to God.

166
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:10,878
Harry was showing
this film that I refused to watch.

167
00:22:11,128 --> 00:22:16,258
That's why I was up on deck
when the yacht exploded.

168
00:22:16,509 --> 00:22:22,431
Did you ever meet anyone whose
life was saved by "Deep Throat"?

169
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,310
Come on, men, let her rest.

170
00:22:32,566 --> 00:22:35,903
Maybe my luck has changed.

171
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:35,231
You know something?

172
00:24:35,481 --> 00:24:40,111
I always wondered how Cortes felt
when he first saw the Inca treasure.

173
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:44,156
It was Pizarro,
and he died busted.

174
00:25:03,968 --> 00:25:08,764
Here we go...
Solid land all right.

175
00:25:09,015 --> 00:25:14,937
This is its profile east to west.
Typical Pacific formation...

176
00:25:15,187 --> 00:25:19,734
This would be the slope at the beach,
the mountainous sector at the west.

177
00:25:19,984 --> 00:25:22,236
Let's get in closer.

178
00:25:24,864 --> 00:25:28,034
-What was that?
-Just a glitch.

179
00:25:28,284 --> 00:25:32,413
-False echo off a flock of birds.
-Spot anything unusual?

180
00:25:32,663 --> 00:25:36,500
-Not a thing.
-Look at the screen, Fred.

181
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:48,512
All those going ashore,
report to the companionway.

182
00:25:53,225 --> 00:25:57,146
Hi there.
How do you like this for beach wear?

183
00:25:57,396 --> 00:26:01,525
Fantastic. I'm afraid
you can't come ashore, though.

184
00:26:01,734 --> 00:26:04,987
Wait a minute.

185
00:26:05,196 --> 00:26:09,659
You said I could come
on the first boat.

186
00:26:09,909 --> 00:26:13,537
You should wait
till the recon is gone.

187
00:26:13,788 --> 00:26:17,541
You want full coverage
of this landing, don't you?

188
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:21,879
I must be in it. The all-American
girl saved from a yacht -

189
00:26:22,088 --> 00:26:25,591
-by "Deep Throat".

190
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:31,806
-Don't print those, I'm married.
-Guaranteed to be on People Magazine.

191
00:26:32,014 --> 00:26:36,143
-Printjust one.
-Really, Mr. Wilson...

192
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:40,439
I need a break,
and you owe it to me.

193
00:26:40,648 --> 00:26:45,861
Because I am a holder of
a Petrox credit card. I really am!

194
00:26:46,112 --> 00:26:48,864
Ask your computer.

195
00:26:49,073 --> 00:26:55,246
<i>I may be late on my payments, but
you take 18%% % interest plus charges.</i>

196
00:26:55,496 --> 00:27:02,211
Dwan, you come ashore with us.
Captain, she'll come ashore.

197
00:27:02,461 --> 00:27:07,675
Good luck. As soon as you get
through, get on the horn.

198
00:27:12,221 --> 00:27:17,476
Hey, Jack? Maybe it's him.
Fred Wilson.

199
00:27:19,103 --> 00:27:23,733
I had my horoscope done
before I flew to Hong Kong.

200
00:27:23,941 --> 00:27:27,111
-It said that I was...
-Here you go.

201
00:27:28,946 --> 00:27:31,490
It said that I was going to cross
over water -

202
00:27:31,741 --> 00:27:35,369
-and meet the biggest person
in my life.

203
00:28:22,541 --> 00:28:28,714
That's interesting. The current is
18 degrees cooler than the air.

204
00:28:28,965 --> 00:28:34,220
-What does that mean?
-The fog might lift at the edge.

205
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:38,599
Crossing 20 fathoms.
Shallowing rapidly.

206
00:28:43,145 --> 00:28:47,692
Standing up ahead.
I think I hear breakers.

207
00:29:05,001 --> 00:29:09,297
Shore boat to Explorer.
There's a curtain around the island.

208
00:29:09,547 --> 00:29:12,383
We just broke through.
There's a beach dead ahead.

209
00:29:12,633 --> 00:29:16,053
<i>In two words: No probIem.</i>

210
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:22,953
Let me get down! I haven't
touched the ground in weeks.

211
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:33,923
That's good.

212
00:30:34,173 --> 00:30:38,552
Jack! I'm coming ashore.

213
00:30:38,761 --> 00:30:43,724
Wait, hold it. All right.

214
00:30:47,395 --> 00:30:50,147
Beautiful.

215
00:30:55,653 --> 00:31:00,992
Let's start getting a line on this
island. Bring the mosquito spray!

216
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:07,456
We won't have to start wondering
which way to go.

217
00:31:07,665 --> 00:31:11,544
You want to start setting
seismic charges this morning?

218
00:31:11,794 --> 00:31:17,383
-Yes. Got to knock the stucture.
-All right, move out!

219
00:31:30,062 --> 00:31:33,399
There's a waterfall ahead!

220
00:31:33,649 --> 00:31:36,986
Last one to get in
is a rotten egg.

221
00:32:20,905 --> 00:32:24,408
Don't go running off anymore.

222
00:32:25,951 --> 00:32:28,955
We'll wait here for them.

223
00:32:32,291 --> 00:32:36,045
Just stick close by me, OK?

224
00:33:57,501 --> 00:34:04,216
Holy Mother!
That looks as old as the pyramids.

225
00:34:04,467 --> 00:34:10,723
Could be. But the pyramids
weren't repaired six months ago.

226
00:34:10,973 --> 00:34:17,146
There's earth on those timbers. It has
to be replaced after each monsoon.

227
00:34:17,396 --> 00:34:21,609
Are you telling me
there's people here?

228
00:34:21,817 --> 00:34:26,280
What's more, I'll characterize them.
Scared people.

229
00:34:26,489 --> 00:34:31,285
-Scared of what?
-I don't exactly what it is.

230
00:34:31,494 --> 00:34:37,750
But apparently, they thought
they needed a wall to keep it out.

231
00:34:37,959 --> 00:34:41,462
Let me straighten you out
on a couple of points.

232
00:34:41,671 --> 00:34:47,259
One: This wall is an ancient ruin.

233
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:52,056
Two: The island is uninhabited.

234
00:35:00,523 --> 00:35:05,403
And three: There's an uninhabited
German beer hall in there.

235
00:35:05,653 --> 00:35:08,239
Let's go.

236
00:36:18,684 --> 00:36:24,273
Fred? Look down there.
Take your binoculars.

237
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:30,112
-What?
-Down there, that pool.

238
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:45,628
-Do you think it could be?
-The surface seems viscous.

239
00:36:45,878 --> 00:36:48,798
It sure as hell could be oil.

240
00:36:50,466 --> 00:36:54,679
Sweet Jesus! Rockefeller!

241
00:37:15,116 --> 00:37:20,037
-Maybe it's a wedding.
-A good guess.

242
00:37:20,288 --> 00:37:24,917
It's scheduled for the night
when the moon's full.

243
00:37:28,796 --> 00:37:31,966
Where's the groom?

244
00:37:40,683 --> 00:37:44,729
See the one
in the ape mask?

245
00:37:44,937 --> 00:37:49,817
You might say
that's the groom's stand-in.

246
00:37:50,067 --> 00:37:53,654
The groom is
on the other side of the wall.

247
00:37:53,904 --> 00:37:58,034
You mean it's bad luck if they
see each other before the wedding?

248
00:37:58,242 --> 00:38:00,786
Ghastly luck
for the whole congregation.

249
00:38:30,149 --> 00:38:32,568
Oh, Christ!

250
00:38:39,116 --> 00:38:42,119
You want to talk for us?

251
00:38:44,288 --> 00:38:47,041
I'll try.

252
00:38:47,249 --> 00:38:50,503
Shoot in the air only.

253
00:38:58,844 --> 00:39:01,764
What's he bitching about?

254
00:39:02,014 --> 00:39:07,687
He's probably telling us we've
contaminated their magic.

255
00:39:30,418 --> 00:39:33,087
No.

256
00:39:39,135 --> 00:39:42,722
Remember, in the air.

257
00:40:05,328 --> 00:40:07,788
What is it?

258
00:40:09,498 --> 00:40:13,711
He wants to make a deal.
Six of them for Dwan.

259
00:40:13,919 --> 00:40:17,673
Tell them that I like him, too,
but not that way.

260
00:40:20,676 --> 00:40:23,596
In the air!

261
00:41:50,725 --> 00:41:54,562
-You'll have trouble with the chief.
-I will buy the chief.

262
00:41:54,812 --> 00:41:58,482
What have we got
that wogs go for?

263
00:41:58,691 --> 00:42:03,404
Radios, pots and pans,
all sorts ofjunk.

264
00:42:03,654 --> 00:42:08,784
This is no longer the 19th century.
You can'tjust grab their island.

265
00:42:09,035 --> 00:42:11,954
I'll check that with the UN.
In the meantime -

266
00:42:12,163 --> 00:42:15,249
-we scare them into the boondocks
with a July 4th number.

267
00:42:15,499 --> 00:42:18,336
Are your men ready
to set the charges?

268
00:42:18,544 --> 00:42:20,838
Kong! Kong!

269
00:42:21,047 --> 00:42:25,676
You heard him chant.
He exists. You saw the wall.

270
00:42:25,885 --> 00:42:28,804
Who do you think they were planning
to give the girl to?

271
00:42:29,055 --> 00:42:35,061
It's some nutty religion.
A priest dresses up and gets laid.

272
00:42:35,311 --> 00:42:38,814
We'll humor Jack.
Take plenty of TNT.

273
00:42:39,023 --> 00:42:42,693
Any sign of a monkey bigger
than four feet, send it bang-bang.

274
00:42:42,902 --> 00:42:45,738
-You wouldn't.
-Bet me.

275
00:42:49,033 --> 00:42:55,998
Even you wouldn't be asshole enough
to wipe out a unique new species.

276
00:42:58,542 --> 00:43:03,089
The kids would burn every
Petrox gas station in the country.

277
00:43:15,851 --> 00:43:19,814
-He could be right.
-Kong, Kong, Kong...

278
00:43:22,358 --> 00:43:26,904
-What are you doing?
-I'm going to steal a boat.

279
00:43:27,154 --> 00:43:32,410
-Seriously?
-As soon as I've swiped supplies.

280
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:37,623
-I'm going on a camera hunt.
-That sounds dangerous.

281
00:43:37,873 --> 00:43:43,045
It's a chance of a lifetime. You
either grab it or you're dead meat.

282
00:43:43,296 --> 00:43:50,344
You shouldn't go ashore tonight.
It's not a good night for Aries.

283
00:43:50,594 --> 00:43:53,931
How did you know I was an Aries?

284
00:43:56,017 --> 00:43:59,687
By the shape of your ears.

285
00:43:59,895 --> 00:44:05,484
All right, I asked Fred Wilson.
He knows everything about you.

286
00:44:05,735 --> 00:44:11,741
-I really wish you wouldn't go.
-Is it better to watch an old movie?

287
00:44:11,991 --> 00:44:14,452
There's nothing else to do.

288
00:44:14,702 --> 00:44:17,705
Use your imagination.

289
00:44:19,707 --> 00:44:24,337
80 times around the deck
is a mile. We could jog.

290
00:44:33,554 --> 00:44:38,768
I guess my camera hunt can wait
a couple of hours.

291
00:44:40,394 --> 00:44:45,524
Excuse me, I'll just finish stealing
in the galley.

292
00:44:45,733 --> 00:44:49,612
You'll disappoint me if you're here
when I get back.

293
00:44:49,862 --> 00:44:55,785
-What do you mean?
-I hope you'll wait in your cabin.

294
00:45:29,777 --> 00:45:34,240
Here you are, son.
Get it out right away.

295
00:45:34,490 --> 00:45:37,326
All right.

296
00:45:39,704 --> 00:45:44,500
I said that pool might be oil.
We can't be sure...

297
00:45:44,709 --> 00:45:50,548
Think positive. Guys who think
negative don't get far at Petrox.

298
00:45:50,798 --> 00:45:55,344
"Has to be the biggest ever.
No problems at all."

299
00:45:55,594 --> 00:46:01,892
-Well, you're the boss.
-Don't worry about it, Roy.

300
00:54:23,227 --> 00:54:25,646
Help!

301
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:32,820
Help me!

302
00:54:43,039 --> 00:54:46,042
No!

303
00:55:32,546 --> 00:55:36,509
We're too late.
Set off the show.

304
00:56:18,217 --> 00:56:23,180
-Help him with that bolt.
-Cover the gate.

305
00:56:25,099 --> 00:56:28,853
Get on the other side!
Pull!

306
00:56:33,441 --> 00:56:36,694
Open that gate!

307
00:56:40,364 --> 00:56:45,411
The lights will hold him back!
Don't shoot.

308
00:57:13,022 --> 00:57:16,359
-He's taken her.
-No one's taken her.

309
00:57:16,609 --> 00:57:21,155
Who do you think went through
there, some guy in an ape suit?

310
00:57:26,827 --> 00:57:30,957
-You all right?
-I just fell in a Goddamn hole.

311
00:57:31,165 --> 00:57:35,544
No, you didn't.
You're not in a hole.

312
00:57:35,753 --> 00:57:38,756
That's a footprint.

313
00:57:54,563 --> 00:58:00,736
Carnahan here. We've gone over two
miles. There's still no sign of her.

314
00:58:00,987 --> 00:58:06,409
-It's better than finding remains.
-Unless he's gobbled her down.

315
00:58:06,617 --> 00:58:11,622
Give me that thing.
Mostjungle apes eat only fruit.

316
00:58:11,872 --> 00:58:16,085
Mostjungle apes don't have
a size-90 foot.

317
00:58:16,335 --> 00:58:19,839
The men have had it.
I'm going to pitch camp.

318
00:58:20,089 --> 00:58:23,092
Are you a bunch of old ladies?
Come on.

319
00:58:23,342 --> 00:58:25,928
Keep moving.

320
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:32,727
Carnahan's right.
It makes more sense to stop.

321
00:58:32,935 --> 00:58:36,647
All right, Carnahan.
You know the drill.

322
00:58:36,897 --> 00:58:41,193
We'll plant seismic charges
for mapping and fire rockets...

323
00:58:41,444 --> 00:58:46,574
-Right, right!
-Will somebody be on the radar?

324
00:58:49,493 --> 00:58:55,916
Any large, furry blimp seen moving
in your direction, you'll know.

325
00:58:58,127 --> 00:59:03,382
That footprint measured 6.4 feet.

326
00:59:03,633 --> 00:59:07,678
If that were for real.
How high would that make him?

327
00:59:07,887 --> 00:59:12,266
Multiplied by about eight, I guess.

328
00:59:14,477 --> 00:59:17,229
He'd make a hell of a commercial.

329
00:59:17,521 --> 00:59:22,401
"The battles we at Petrox fight
to fill your tank."

330
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:40,461
If he's not going to eat her,
why did he take her?

331
00:59:43,714 --> 00:59:48,594
Apes are very territorial.
He'll probably take her to his turf.

332
00:59:48,844 --> 00:59:51,138
What for?

333
00:59:51,347 --> 00:59:55,893
Joe said you said that the ape
was going to marry her.

334
00:59:56,143 --> 01:00:01,565
-Is that some kind ofjoke or...
-I don't know, Carnahan!

335
01:00:01,816 --> 01:00:07,321
I'm as ignorant as you. Quit asking
me so many dumb questions.

336
01:03:07,793 --> 01:03:10,963
I can't stand heights.

337
01:03:14,050 --> 01:03:21,098
Honest I can't. When I was ten I got
sick in the Empire State Building.

338
01:03:27,438 --> 01:03:30,858
Put me down!

339
01:03:35,196 --> 01:03:37,782
You put me down!

340
01:03:43,621 --> 01:03:47,750
You put me down!

341
01:03:50,169 --> 01:03:53,965
Put me down.

342
01:03:59,178 --> 01:04:02,765
Please put me down.

343
01:04:17,196 --> 01:04:20,950
You Goddamn chauvinist pig ape!

344
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:25,663
What are you waiting for?
You wanna eat me?

345
01:04:25,913 --> 01:04:32,878
Then go ahaed! Do it!
Go ahead and eat me!

346
01:04:33,087 --> 01:04:37,466
Go ahead! Choke on me!

347
01:04:43,597 --> 01:04:48,644
I didn't mean that.
Sometimes I get too physical.

348
01:04:48,894 --> 01:04:54,025
It's a sign of insecurity,
like when you knock down trees.

349
01:04:56,861 --> 01:05:03,659
Such a nice ape.
Such a nice, sweet monkey.

350
01:05:05,244 --> 01:05:09,165
We're going to be great friends.

351
01:05:09,415 --> 01:05:16,047
I'm a Libra, what sign are you?
No, don't tell me.

352
01:05:16,297 --> 01:05:21,218
I'll bet you're an Aries.
Of course you are.

353
01:05:21,469 --> 01:05:24,805
I think that's just wonderful.

354
01:06:22,321 --> 01:06:25,324
Help me!

355
01:06:30,705 --> 01:06:32,915
Help me!

356
01:07:22,214 --> 01:07:25,718
Radar had him on the screen.

357
01:07:25,968 --> 01:07:32,933
3.6 kilometres west of your flare.
He moved in a random manner.

358
01:07:33,142 --> 01:07:37,688
-Not in our direction?
-Affirmative. Random. Like a circle.

359
01:07:37,897 --> 01:07:42,526
Maybe he's lost her. She got away
and he's searching for her.

360
01:07:42,777 --> 01:07:45,863
Carnahan! Wait a minute!

361
01:07:46,113 --> 01:07:50,493
<i>-Have you set seismic charges?
-The men are doing it now.</i>

362
01:07:50,701 --> 01:07:55,081
-Don't move until it's finished.
-He's nuts.

363
01:07:55,331 --> 01:08:01,170
The girl might be running for her life
from a gigantic turned-on ape.

364
01:08:01,420 --> 01:08:05,216
I know how you feel.

365
01:08:05,466 --> 01:08:08,135
But there's an energy crisis.

366
01:08:08,386 --> 01:08:13,015
We must all rise above
our self-interests.

367
01:08:13,224 --> 01:08:18,729
-You hypocritical bastard...
-Save your wind, he's signed off.

368
01:08:18,938 --> 01:08:21,399
Let's get going.

369
01:08:21,607 --> 01:08:24,860
I ain't busting my ass for no whites.

370
01:08:25,111 --> 01:08:31,033
OK. Who gives a shit that
the ape's headed in our direction?

371
01:10:46,752 --> 01:10:51,716
-There's Roy.
-Well, Fred...

372
01:10:51,924 --> 01:10:55,428
I finished testing the samples
from that pool.

373
01:10:55,678 --> 01:11:00,057
-It'll be real great oil!
-Son of a bitch!

374
01:11:01,517 --> 01:11:04,186
Fred Wilson is crazy, is he?

375
01:11:04,395 --> 01:11:09,275
Wait till those candy-asses
in New York hear about this.

376
01:11:09,525 --> 01:11:13,738
-I'll grind them...
-Like I said, it will be great oil.

377
01:11:13,946 --> 01:11:19,619
As soon as Mother Nature
finishes cooking it a little longer.

378
01:11:19,827 --> 01:11:22,246
How much longer?

379
01:11:22,496 --> 01:11:28,502
Hardly a tick of clock, in geological
terms. Say 10,000 years.

380
01:11:29,754 --> 01:11:35,926
Till then you'd get better mileage
filling your Cadillac with mule piss.

381
01:11:38,179 --> 01:11:40,848
Oh, my God!

382
01:11:42,642 --> 01:11:46,270
I hate to kick a fella when he's dead,
but I told you.

383
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:51,651
You shouldn't have told New York
you were bringing in the big one.

384
01:11:54,987 --> 01:11:59,283
The big one. Jesus!

385
01:12:01,577 --> 01:12:06,290
Who says I ain't gonna?
Wilson to Explorer.

386
01:12:06,540 --> 01:12:10,294
Get me a channel to Surabaya,
I want an engineer drop.

387
01:12:27,395 --> 01:12:30,231
OK, Jack, you go first.

388
01:13:02,930 --> 01:13:08,519
-Come on, it's solid as a rock.
-OK, let's go.

389
01:13:24,660 --> 01:13:28,080
-Stop firing!
-Jack!

390
01:15:51,599 --> 01:15:55,019
Boan! Try to make it back.

391
01:15:57,980 --> 01:16:01,233
I'm going on.

392
01:16:31,097 --> 01:16:34,684
<i>AII hands, stand by for recovery.</i>

393
01:16:53,786 --> 01:16:57,331
-Over and out.
-Recharge the batteries.

394
01:16:57,540 --> 01:17:01,877
-Air drop done, right on target.
-Perfect. Haul your asses.

395
01:17:02,086 --> 01:17:06,132
Get that equipment working.

396
01:17:06,340 --> 01:17:08,968
-You think I'm crazy?
-You said it.

397
01:17:09,176 --> 01:17:14,515
If I had found oil, Gulf, Shell, Exxon
would be crawling all over here.

398
01:17:14,724 --> 01:17:18,769
Not this one, pal.
Kong is all me and Petrox.

399
01:17:18,978 --> 01:17:24,734
A Fred S. Wilson exclusive.
Move your ass, Shorty.

400
01:17:28,863 --> 01:17:32,325
You think it'll ring the bell?
Promise oil, bring back a monkey?

401
01:17:32,533 --> 01:17:37,997
Look at Exxon's
"We'll Put a Tiger in Your Tank".

402
01:17:38,205 --> 01:17:43,669
Beach green to Carnahan.
Report back immediately.

403
01:17:43,878 --> 01:17:47,381
Do nothing to endanger Kong.
Acknowledge.

404
01:17:48,758 --> 01:17:54,013
Carnahan, do you read me?
Do you read me?

405
01:18:26,754 --> 01:18:30,424
Give us a hand over here.

406
01:18:36,138 --> 01:18:40,268
Wilson!
Still no contact with Carnahan.

407
01:18:40,476 --> 01:18:44,647
-The radio's not working. No sweat.
-I want to take out a search party.

408
01:18:44,855 --> 01:18:50,027
-I can't spare any men.
-Six guys are cut off in the bush.

409
01:18:50,236 --> 01:18:55,825
And you're building monkey traps.
You're playing with their lives.

410
01:18:56,033 --> 01:18:58,953
Don't worry about it.

411
01:19:04,875 --> 01:19:08,379
Boan!

412
01:19:11,799 --> 01:19:14,885
Where's the others?

413
01:19:54,634 --> 01:19:58,596
Come on, Kong, forget about me.

414
01:19:58,804 --> 01:20:04,477
This is never going to work.
Can't you see?

415
01:22:31,874 --> 01:22:34,543
Jack!

416
01:23:57,710 --> 01:24:00,630
We've got to do it.

417
01:24:00,838 --> 01:24:04,008
Are you ready?

418
01:24:31,035 --> 01:24:36,332
Radar update. Monkey spotted
1,800 yards west by north-west -

419
01:24:36,540 --> 01:24:41,879
<i>-heading 0-89,
veIocity 2.2 miIes per hour.</i>

420
01:24:42,088 --> 01:24:46,801
<i>Estimated time to your position,
five minutes or Iess.</i>

421
01:24:47,009 --> 01:24:51,013
Kill the lights.
Everybody clear out!

422
01:24:58,813 --> 01:25:05,111
-Logan, how are you doing?
-Almost finished. One minute more.

423
01:25:09,573 --> 01:25:14,036
-That's enough.
-All set, Mr. Bagley!

424
01:25:16,706 --> 01:25:21,210
-Ready, Boan?
-OK. It's hot now.

425
01:25:21,419 --> 01:25:26,590
Are you sure that monkey will
be able to bust through that gate?

426
01:25:28,301 --> 01:25:31,637
Pull back the bolt halfway.

427
01:25:38,769 --> 01:25:41,939
-Come on.
-I can't.

428
01:26:21,771 --> 01:26:25,107
Open the gate! Help!

429
01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:30,863
-Help!
-Jack!

430
01:26:32,448 --> 01:26:35,618
It's Prescott, open the gate.

431
01:26:52,468 --> 01:26:55,221
Come on!

432
01:27:09,443 --> 01:27:11,862
Close the bolt!

433
01:28:49,293 --> 01:28:53,172
Wilson, blow the Goddamn thing!

434
01:31:47,680 --> 01:31:51,225
Still want to play?

435
01:31:53,185 --> 01:31:57,315
Dwan! Congratulations.

436
01:32:09,493 --> 01:32:12,872
Hey, Jack.
Do I look different?

437
01:32:14,790 --> 01:32:19,587
-Yeah, you shine.
-That's right.

438
01:32:19,795 --> 01:32:22,715
-I'm a star.
-It's all set.

439
01:32:22,923 --> 01:32:28,888
Coast-to-coast tour. We open in
New York. Lights, cameras, Kong!

440
01:32:29,096 --> 01:32:32,308
And probably Nureyev and Fontaine.

441
01:32:32,516 --> 01:32:37,939
I want Balanchine to choreograph
"The Beauty and the Beast".

442
01:32:39,857 --> 01:32:42,735
Any chance of you two
getting married?

443
01:32:42,944 --> 01:32:47,865
I don't know.
This is so sudden.

444
01:32:48,074 --> 01:32:53,454
We could think of some nutty way
of Kong giving away the bride.

445
01:32:56,707 --> 01:33:03,798
It'd be tough to get him to do it.
Probably just old-fashioned, huh?

446
01:33:04,006 --> 01:33:08,719
I don't know.
What do you think, Jack?

447
01:33:17,979 --> 01:33:20,398
Christ.

448
01:33:23,693 --> 01:33:30,408
After all these years,
I'll finally end up with a shrink.

449
01:33:37,832 --> 01:33:41,669
How can I become a star
because of someone -

450
01:33:41,877 --> 01:33:47,258
-that was stolen off that gorgeous
island and locked up in that tank?

451
01:33:47,466 --> 01:33:53,889
It's not someone. It's an animal
that tried to rape you.

452
01:33:54,098 --> 01:33:58,686
That's not true.
He risked his life to save me.

453
01:33:58,894 --> 01:34:01,647
He tried to rape you, honey.

454
01:34:01,856 --> 01:34:06,152
Ask the natives what they thought
of losing Kong.

455
01:34:06,360 --> 01:34:10,656
-They'll miss him a lot.
-Like leprosy.

456
01:34:10,865 --> 01:34:17,455
You're dead wrong. He was the
terror, the mystery of their lives.

457
01:34:18,748 --> 01:34:23,669
A year from now, the island
will be full of burned-out drunks.

458
01:34:23,878 --> 01:34:28,132
When we took Kong,
we kidnapped their god.

459
01:34:32,094 --> 01:34:35,264
It's like there's a curse
on all of us.

460
01:34:35,473 --> 01:34:38,476
I'm tired of your trying to confuse
this girl.

461
01:34:38,684 --> 01:34:42,396
This is her big chance. And yours.
There's stars at Princeton -

462
01:34:42,605 --> 01:34:47,568
-just like in Hollywood. You want
me to get Kong another keeper?

463
01:34:47,777 --> 01:34:50,905
Coast-to-coast tours?
"Beauty and the Beast"? It's a farce.

464
01:34:51,113 --> 01:34:55,576
Just say the word and your contract
is torn up. Tell me right now.

465
01:35:00,623 --> 01:35:03,542
See you opening night.

466
01:35:16,347 --> 01:35:20,601
Oh, God,
I'm tired of thinking.

467
01:35:32,947 --> 01:35:37,994
-The ape had the right idea.
-What's that?

468
01:36:48,522 --> 01:36:51,651
Wait a minute.

469
01:36:55,029 --> 01:36:57,990
I'll be right back.

470
01:37:44,996 --> 01:37:48,457
<i>AII hands on deck!</i>

471
01:37:53,045 --> 01:37:56,966
<i>Fire detaiI,
report to the controI room.</i>

472
01:38:00,595 --> 01:38:04,724
<i>This is the captain.
Sea water pumps to fuII pressure.</i>

473
01:38:04,932 --> 01:38:09,562
<i>Prepare to flood tank No. 4.
I"m ordering the ape drowned.</i>

474
01:38:13,065 --> 01:38:17,403
Hey, Kong! Here I am.

475
01:38:22,950 --> 01:38:27,705
Do you remember me?
Remember your blind date?

476
01:38:27,913 --> 01:38:30,958
You haven't forgotten, have you?

477
01:38:39,675 --> 01:38:44,847
Dwan! Come back here!
He's going berserk.

478
01:38:45,056 --> 01:38:49,226
-Stop, or I'll jump.
-Dwan, please.

479
01:38:49,435 --> 01:38:54,023
-You can't help him now.
-Don't come any closer.

480
01:38:54,231 --> 01:38:56,776
OK.

481
01:38:59,403 --> 01:39:05,368
Hey, Kong? Why are you waking up
all these people?

482
01:39:05,576 --> 01:39:10,873
No one's going to hurt you.
You're just going to be a star.

483
01:39:19,966 --> 01:39:24,262
Don't flood the tank! She fell in.

484
01:41:32,431 --> 01:41:35,226
You could've...

485
01:42:36,537 --> 01:42:40,499
Jack! I'm so glad to see you.

486
01:42:43,461 --> 01:42:49,091
-What is it? You're not dressed.
-That's right.

487
01:42:49,300 --> 01:42:53,804
I was wrong when I called this
thing a farce, it's a tragedy.

488
01:42:54,013 --> 01:42:59,352
-I'm quitting your circus, Fred.
-You signed a contract.

489
01:42:59,560 --> 01:43:02,480
-You took an advance.
-I donated it in your name.

490
01:43:02,688 --> 01:43:08,152
To the SPCA Fund for Sending
Kong Home. Here's your receipt.

491
01:43:08,361 --> 01:43:13,282
-Sue me.
-Don't leave me tonight, please.

492
01:43:13,491 --> 01:43:17,620
-My horoscope says...
-Shut up. I love you.

493
01:43:21,540 --> 01:43:26,796
Come with me right now.
The hell with the contract.

494
01:43:27,004 --> 01:43:31,968
Go ahead. But I promise you
you'll never get another booking.

495
01:43:32,176 --> 01:43:36,138
You'll end up tap-dancing
at rotary clubs.

496
01:43:38,599 --> 01:43:43,813
-Don't you understand?
-Yeah...

497
01:43:44,021 --> 01:43:48,693
I do. Sorry.

498
01:43:51,320 --> 01:43:54,573
Stay well.

499
01:44:17,430 --> 01:44:21,267
<i>Ladies and gentIemen
of our TV-satellite audience, -</i>

500
01:44:21,475 --> 01:44:25,313
<i>-you are seeing this
Iive around the worId-</i>

501
01:44:25,521 --> 01:44:31,193
<i>-as it is happening
here in New York City.</i>

502
01:44:31,402 --> 01:44:38,200
<i>You have better seats than these
Iucky King Kong contest winners.</i>

503
01:44:59,347 --> 01:45:05,102
Thus, Beauty set foot on the
forbidden island and was seized.

504
01:45:05,311 --> 01:45:08,689
Great was the fear
as Beauty was lashed -

505
01:45:08,898 --> 01:45:13,945
-to the dreadful bridal altar
of the Beast.

506
01:45:14,153 --> 01:45:18,115
Now the earth booms.

507
01:45:52,275 --> 01:45:57,488
Kong's power!
Superpower!

508
01:45:59,532 --> 01:46:02,743
Hail the power!

509
01:46:35,943 --> 01:46:41,407
That's the power of Kong,
and Petrox!

510
01:46:53,419 --> 01:46:56,255
No! Don't push her around!

511
01:47:04,722 --> 01:47:08,559
Ladies and gentlemen,
there is nothing to fear!

512
01:47:08,768 --> 01:47:15,316
That is an escape-proof cage
certified by the city government.

513
01:47:39,090 --> 01:47:43,177
Come on out! Easy.

514
01:47:43,386 --> 01:47:47,056
His feet are still chained.

515
01:47:48,516 --> 01:47:52,478
It's all right. Come on.

516
01:49:51,180 --> 01:49:53,683
We're in position.

517
01:49:53,891 --> 01:49:58,729
The Queensboro Bridge is buttoned
up. What's the situation at Brooklyn?

518
01:49:58,938 --> 01:50:03,109
<i>I"II teII that monkey to spread
before he crosses it.</i>

519
01:50:05,778 --> 01:50:09,073
Come on, there's a train coming.

520
01:52:10,653 --> 01:52:13,197
Hit the lights.

521
01:52:28,838 --> 01:52:33,009
<i>This is a message to aII traffic.</i>

522
01:52:33,217 --> 01:52:37,179
<i>CIear aII streets.
Proceed to sheIters.</i>

523
01:52:37,388 --> 01:52:44,854
<i>Repeating: CIear aII streets. Any
person found Iooting wiII be shot.</i>

524
01:53:02,955 --> 01:53:05,833
Keep running.

525
01:53:06,042 --> 01:53:10,880
Jack! Buy me a drink, will you?

526
01:53:11,088 --> 01:53:14,008
Come on, buy me a drink.

527
01:53:14,216 --> 01:53:18,346
Ten more blocks and we've got
the key to a great apartment.

528
01:53:18,554 --> 01:53:21,474
We've put a river between us.

529
01:53:21,682 --> 01:53:26,103
The bridges are mined, and apes
don't swim. Your book says so.

530
01:53:26,312 --> 01:53:32,068
Please, buy me a drink.
Buy me a drink over there.

531
01:53:34,528 --> 01:53:36,864
OK.

532
01:53:40,242 --> 01:53:43,204
What's the matter?

533
01:53:43,412 --> 01:53:48,960
Déjà vu. I don't know where,
but I've seen this view before.

534
01:54:23,452 --> 01:54:26,622
Here.

535
01:54:26,831 --> 01:54:30,626
We don't want to get shot as looters.

536
01:54:30,835 --> 01:54:35,214
OK, get smashed.

537
01:54:35,423 --> 01:54:40,469
How about that nice offer
you made me? Do you still want me?

538
01:54:43,431 --> 01:54:49,437
Look, chinchilla.
Looks great on you.

539
01:54:49,645 --> 01:54:54,692
I asked you a question.

540
01:54:54,900 --> 01:54:58,738
-You know what I earn?
-Do you think I need furs?

541
01:54:58,946 --> 01:55:05,161
Yes. Excitement is in your blood
like dope.

542
01:55:06,871 --> 01:55:11,626
You're going to need new fixes
I'm not able to give you.

543
01:55:11,834 --> 01:55:15,171
Don't be stupid.

544
01:55:52,500 --> 01:55:55,294
It's OK.

545
01:55:57,213 --> 01:56:02,677
Probably some National Guardsman
ran his tank into a powerhouse.

546
01:56:02,885 --> 01:56:06,055
Do you remember that black-out?

547
01:56:06,264 --> 01:56:11,686
And all the babies born
exactly nine months later?

548
01:56:11,894 --> 01:56:16,732
Well, here's to all the future
sons and daughters of King Kong.

549
01:56:17,942 --> 01:56:20,987
I'll drink to that.

550
01:56:23,489 --> 01:56:30,246
The hell with furs. Tell me,
does that nice offer still stand?

551
01:56:32,039 --> 01:56:38,796
It depends on Kong. He's bigger
than both of us, know what I mean?

552
01:56:39,005 --> 01:56:41,799
Don't tease me, I'm serious.

553
01:56:47,722 --> 01:56:51,767
Of course. I know
where I've seen that view before.

554
01:57:05,031 --> 01:57:09,910
I think we've got a chance. Sit tight,
I've got to make a phone call.

555
01:57:11,329 --> 01:57:15,082
Keep it down, everyone.

556
01:57:15,291 --> 01:57:19,295
What do you think?
Is he flipped out or not?

557
01:57:19,503 --> 01:57:24,133
Hello? Hello...

558
01:57:24,342 --> 01:57:27,970
Excuse me, Professor. You say
you know where Kong is headed.

559
01:57:28,179 --> 01:57:31,807
Yes.
You can trap him without danger.

560
01:57:32,016 --> 01:57:36,479
Get some helicopters and
blasting nets on top of him.

561
01:57:36,687 --> 01:57:41,984
No problem. Where is he headed,
Professor Prescott?

562
01:57:42,193 --> 01:57:47,949
Promise me to capture him
without injury and I'll tell you.

563
01:57:57,124 --> 01:58:01,420
-Do we have a deal?
-Yes, Professor.

564
01:58:01,629 --> 01:58:04,131
Where is Kong heading?

565
01:58:04,340 --> 01:58:10,012
A place in Manhattan that looks
exactly like his natural habitat.

566
01:58:10,221 --> 01:58:14,558
Let him climb to the top of
the World Trade Center.

567
01:58:53,889 --> 01:58:56,809
Jack!

568
01:59:26,964 --> 01:59:31,928
He's coming down Fifth Avenue
on schedule.

569
01:59:32,136 --> 01:59:38,017
The power is back on.
Keep quiet, get in the shadows.

570
02:00:20,434 --> 02:00:22,812
No.

571
02:01:20,995 --> 02:01:23,706
Hold on! Close your eyes!

572
02:01:23,914 --> 02:01:28,169
The helicopters are coming
to net him!

573
02:02:13,214 --> 02:02:15,883
Hold on!

574
02:03:36,714 --> 02:03:39,467
Kong...

575
02:04:12,583 --> 02:04:17,338
What are those men doing up there?
Didn't they get my orders?

576
02:05:39,503 --> 02:05:42,131
The rotten bastards!

577
02:06:00,232 --> 02:06:06,656
He's still got the girl. Follow me
in a tight holding pattern.

578
02:06:27,551 --> 02:06:31,806
No! Don't put me down.

579
02:06:32,014 --> 02:06:35,810
Hold on to me.

580
02:06:38,229 --> 02:06:42,024
Hold on to me, or they'll kill you.

581
02:06:49,323 --> 02:06:51,867
Now!

582
02:06:59,542 --> 02:07:02,044
Oh, God.

583
02:07:17,727 --> 02:07:20,146
Wait.

584
02:07:27,987 --> 02:07:30,656
Hold on to me.

585
02:07:30,865 --> 02:07:34,785
Please don't let me go.

586
02:07:47,173 --> 02:07:49,550
Don't kill him!

587
02:07:52,219 --> 02:07:54,764
Don't kill him!

588
02:08:07,276 --> 02:08:10,112
Assholes!

589
02:09:15,511 --> 02:09:18,055
Kong.

590
02:11:06,956 --> 02:11:09,750
Dwan!

591
02:11:09,959 --> 02:11:12,670
Jack!

592
02:11:14,171 --> 02:11:17,258
Jack!
