1
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:46,900
How do you describe both a beginning and an end?

2
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:49,880
We should have known better.

3
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,890
But we didn't.

4
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,690
What does it matter what we think we know?

5
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:01,560
In the end, there's no denying the truth.

6
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,940
Jerusalem, 6:00 PM

7
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,850
Iraq, 6:03 PM

8
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:34,460
Syrian - Israeli border, 6:03 PM

9
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,920
Mediterranean Sea, 6:04 PM

10
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:54,370
And as the world faces the most serious 
food shortage in history

11
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:56,480
Perhaps there is a ray of hope.

12
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,960
I'm Buck Williams and I'm standing in a wheat field

13
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,700
in the middle of the Israeli desert.

14
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,770
Doctor Rosenzweig...

15
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,870
It looks like Iowa!

16
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:09,420
We've truly been blessed with a miracle.

17
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,980
One that you have created.

18
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,640
Now the biggest question remains:

19
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,010
Who do you trust?

20
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:19,060
Every nation, every corporation wants your formula...

21
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,310
especially in the light of the recent crop failures.

22
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:24,610
No, no, no. Eden is not for sale.

23
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:27,680
Not for money.

24
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,730
All I want is

25
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:32,500
peace for Israel, a peace that...

26
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:45,610
It looks like the Israeli Air Force never sleeps...

27
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,760
Those are not our planes!

28
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:49,720
Not from that direction.

29
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,460
Let's take cover!

30
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,740
Mr. Williams, please, this way!

31
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:11,620
I want all four commanders to notify the front line.

32
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:14,750
Put the main squadron into a full state of alert.

33
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,830
This is it.

34
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,560
What's going on? 
 -It's a full-scale air attack.

35
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,080
No warning.

36
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,470
By who?

37
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:25,280
Could be anyone.

38
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,970
No one has more enemies who want to 
see her destroyed than Israel.

39
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:37,070
I don't care if the electronics are jammed; 
get those planes up!

40
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,780
We cannot get our planes up!

41
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,990
It's treachery!

42
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:44,600
With our technical problems,

43
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,550
they're over Jerusalem!

44
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:49,420
The Eden Project could've feed the whole world,

45
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:53,610
but now, it is merely going to die with us.

46
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:10,980
Enemy planes are taking direct hits? 
I don't understand.

47
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:14,910
We haven't launched any missiles.

48
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:19,170
Those planes are coming down and we 
haven't fired a shot.

49
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:20,820
It's not possible!

50
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:23,490
They're jamming our monitors, it's a cruel trick.

51
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,960
Only one way to find out.

52
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,960
No, Buck!

53
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,580
This is Buck Williams, reporting live from Israel.

54
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:05,420
I am standing in the middle of an all-out attack.

55
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:12,520
The sun is gone, thousands of planes are 
soaring overhead.

56
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:14,730
Fire is raining from the sky.

57
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:16,550
This is just unbelievable!

58
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:20,510
This has got to be the biggest surprise attack 
since Pearl Harbor.

59
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,750
Get out of there, Buck!

60
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:30,610
I've been informed by top-ranking military officials 
that Israel has not been able to launch even a 
single plane in defence. 

61
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,820
He would have filmed Hiroshima from ground zero, 
if he would've been there.

62
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:35,270
Yeah, that's our Buck!

63
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:40,090
As I stand here, fighter planes are exploding 
in mid-air.

64
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:43,720
They're crashing and falling to the ground 
without any explanation.

65
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:49,040
And while no one seems to be able to give me any reason 
for why this is happening, I can tell you this:

66
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:55,180
This all-out, unprecedented attempt to destroy Israel 
appears to be failing.

67
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:09,770
War will continue until the end.

68
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:12,150
Desolations have been decreeted.

69
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:19,150
He will confirm a covenant with many... for 7 years.

70
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:26,700
"Corespondents from the Israeli army deny any connection 
to the destruction of the planes"

71
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:28,680
"..however, inside sources reveal"

72
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,020
Hey, turn that up!
 -Mum said to turn it down.

73
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,860
Do you always do as you're told?
 - Hey, you should try it sometimes.

74
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:36,910
Give me that!

75
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:39,770
"...for the most reliable and up-to-date information"

76
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,420
"I am Buck Williams."

77
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:48,120
Mum, can you find my art book?

78
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,760
Sure, if you'll help me clean up a little and put up some of these streamers.

79
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,030
No thanks. I am never having kids.

80
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,020
Lucky them.

81
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:57,200
Nice touch with the nose-ring, Chloe.

82
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,710
Why not just shave your head and get it over with?

83
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:00,670
Funny!

84
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,750
I thought your flight didn't leave until midnight?

85
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,990
Well, they just called. They want me on the New York - London.

86
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,070
What about Raymie's birthday party?

87
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:13,640
He's all right. Rayme wants that knight's helmet I promised from Buckingham Palace, right pal?

88
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:16,290
Right, or a sword...

89
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:19,130
or one of those long pointy sticks that they put 
heads on.

90
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:21,930
Don't push it! Where does he come up 
with this stuff?

91
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,930
Sunday school!

92
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:29,390
You have to go now? 
-For me to get that helmet, yeah I do.

93
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:39,760
I'll be back in 3 days, all right?

94
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:42,300
OK? 
-all right.

95
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:45,210
See, I told you there's nothing wrong...
-Ray, we've talked about this..

96
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:47,390
- You knew...
- Look, I don't have any control...

97
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:48,710
Yes you do...you can say no...

98
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,160
Doorbell.

99
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:56,960
Yeah, comming!

100
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:01,090
- Hey, reverend! 
 - Hey, Ray, what's going on?

101
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:03,270
- Come on in, Bruce!
- Bruce, how's it going?

102
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,920
What's that, birthday boy?

103
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,720
- Bruce, where is Jenna. 
- Baby's sick.

104
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:12,180
- Don't throw the ball in the house!
 - Hey, see you, Raymie!

105
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,040
Well, I haven't seen you in a while.

106
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,670
People still have to fly, even on Sundays. Excuse me.

107
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,310
- Ray!
 - Hey, what did I say?

108
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:25,120
Ray!

109
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,120
- I'll see you in a couple of days.
 - OK.

110
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:39,390
- I love you. 
 - Yeah, me too.

111
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:42,460
Bye!

112
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:50,610
Dad, where are you going?

113
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:53,880
You heard me tell your mother, I have to go to London, 
I have to work.

114
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,880
What about Raymie?

115
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,860
I can see that your bags are all packed, ready to go.

116
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,710
You know I have exams, I have to go.

117
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:05,110
And I have a flight. It's called a job. 
Welcome to the real world!

118
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:11,280
Your mother has all those people coming over 
and I just can't listen to it...

119
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,650
They're not my type of people either, 
but maybe we could show her some support?

120
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:17,420
But what about her respecting what 
the rest of us think, huh?

121
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:21,550
She's on me too, but I listen. You know, 
sometimes I even pretend to take an interest.

122
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,200
- It's not like she's hurting anybody!
 - I wouldn't say that.

123
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:31,420
You know, maybe you should try talking to 
her instead of running away all the time.

124
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:38,550
Good luck on your exams, sweetheart!

125
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,700
Have a safe flight, dad.

126
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,170
GNN Studios, New York

127
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:07,470
Mr. Williams, good to see you back. 
 -Thanks.

128
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:11,860
Hello!

129
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:15,990
"Dirk Burton. I know who's behind those planes 
falling out of the sky!"

130
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:19,000
- Dirk, what are you talking about?
 - Not on an open line.

131
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,800
"Meet me at the usual spot."

132
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:04,590
The world is in danger, Buck. All of us.

133
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:09,100
Dirk, just calm down. Knock it down a couple thousand RPMs. 
What's the matter?

134
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:13,420
It's Cothran. I got the file. He thought it was locked, 
but I got it, I got in.

135
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:15,300
What do you know about Rosenzweig?

136
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,540
Dirk, what are you talking about?

137
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:19,700
Don't you see? Chaim Rosenzweig. The formula.

138
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,560
And it's so clear.

139
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:25,920
The attack. The bombers exploding, the flights exploding.

140
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,590
See, see, it's all fitting together now.

141
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:31,880
I see it, cause they've been behind this 
whole thing from the beginning.

142
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:36,150
The research, the trust funds, and there's the currency.

143
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:37,440
That's the next step.

144
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,290
You see, the dollars, the pounds, the euro, the yemen, 
they're going to make it all into one.

145
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:43,040
One, Buck.

146
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,730
Don't you see? It's always about the money, isn't it?

147
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:49,740
What do you know about Rosenzweig. 
He must've said something. Come on!
Think! Think!

148
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,060
When is the last time you slept?

149
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,940
I'll get all the sleep I need when I'm dead.

150
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:00,950
Rosenzweig.

151
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:02,950
Come on, Buck, Rosenzweig!

152
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:06,300
He's a scientist. He's an UN delegate. He's my friend.

153
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:08,160
Chaim is a good guy.

154
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,000
While he might have all the world's best intentions in mind..

155
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:14,200
But not the guys behind him. Not them for sure!

156
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,100
Who?

157
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:19,450
Cothran and Stonagal.

158
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:24,240
Those guys are bankers. What do they have to do 
with those planes in Israel?

159
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,200
Ten tracks of land. The whole thing.

160
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:30,880
But it's gonna go further. Oh, yeah. 
They're not finished.

161
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,210
What's next, huh? What's next?

162
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,880
Who knows? It's gonna be unimaginable. Here...

163
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,650
Look at this. Stonagal's plan for the world.

164
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:44,780
Come on, Dirk. This is an old college essay.

165
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,280
And this...

166
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:54,800
What's that?

167
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:59,850
Everything from Cothran's computer, 
and all the stuff I've been working on.

168
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,700
No, no. I can't give it to you. 
I can't risk you being caught with it.

169
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,330
Caught by who?

170
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:09,670
The NSA, the CIA, the Mossad...

171
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:12,180
I mean who knows how further this goes..
Dirk, Dirk!

172
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:17,560
You're a nut and I love you. I always have 
and I always will. But come on, man!

173
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:20,930
If you think you got something, then 
give it to me, all right?

174
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:23,800
Or give it to Alan. We will help you put this thing...

175
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,800
I need more time.

176
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:28,990
Don't worry, Buck. When I get all the pieces in place,

177
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:32,300
You'll blow Cothran and Stonagal out of the water.
- Dirk...

178
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:34,300
Promise me you'll do it!

179
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:37,060
Listen. You bring me a story...

180
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,100
and you know I'll drive it down to the bone.

181
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:50,990
Get some sleep. Seriously.

182
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:04,840
Can I get you to sign this, Mr. Williams?

183
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:07,070
Must've been a nightmare over there, huh?

184
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,070
Had to get the story.

185
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:09,790
Thanks.

186
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,130
What's he saying?

187
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:21,430
I don't know. It sounds like hebrew.

188
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:24,200
No. I was there. I heard him. It was english.

189
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,290
Amazing you could hear anything with those 
explosions going off everywhere.

190
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:30,070
"What used to be a Third World problem.."

191
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:32,110
"..is now knocking at the door.."

192
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:35,030
"..of even the most prosperous nations."

193
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,140
"How can we find peace when people are starving?"

194
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:41,900
Father Theresa!

195
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:45,780
If we all listened to Carpathia, we'd be one 
big happy family.

196
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,860
Scary would be relating.

197
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,570
Speaking of families this just came over the wire.

198
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:54,080
Europe has just standardized their currency with Korea. 
Bizarre, huh?

199
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:57,910
One step closer to a global currency.

200
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,160
Come on, darling, I need you.

201
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:05,590
Ivy, see if you can get Dirk Burton 
on the phone for me?

202
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:08,100
Why? Are we doing another story about Area 51?

203
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:31,380
World peace.

204
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:35,340
It's been a dream ever since Cain 
looked sideways at Cabel.

205
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:39,730
And thanks to your efforts, it can become 
a reality for all of us.

206
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:43,060
It has only been possible with your support, 
Mr. Stonagal.

207
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:47,010
Ah yes, but you have natural presence, Nikolai.

208
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:51,000
And you give us every confidence in your 
ability to lead the UN.

209
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Thank you, sir.

210
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,360
Your generosity is overwhelming.

211
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:58,630
It's called money. It gives us that luxury.

212
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:03,020
Your main concern, the one thing you 
have to worry about..

213
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:06,460
..is that one issue.

214
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:08,060
World peace.

215
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:10,060
Yes, of course.

216
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,130
In your opinion,

217
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:15,020
Will Dr. Rosenzweig accept our proposal?

218
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:18,850
It is an enormous decision for him.

219
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,820
He is very close.

220
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:25,260
Maybe this will help convince him?

221
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:32,880
This is incredible.

222
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,310
How did you?..

223
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:45,300
Mr. Stonagal, I'm not sure I have the authority to..

224
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:49,950
My friend, if you want events to mirror your desires..

225
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:52,480
.. You create your own policy.

226
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,080
Based on your past successes, 
I'm sure you're right.

227
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:59,210
And Rosenzweig should know who he can trust.

228
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:02,040
So should you, Nikolai.

229
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:05,700
You know, I can see myself at your age,

230
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:10,110
and I can see your deep concern for 
the global conscience.

231
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:16,280
If I could accomplish even half of what 
you and Mr. Cothran..

232
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:20,210
You will! You will outdistance us. 
We will see to that.

233
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:27,310
I have a plane waiting for you.

234
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:38,390
Bring us back that olive branch. Good luck!

235
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,230
I don't like it, John.

236
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:57,220
Don't worry.

237
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:59,220
People see him as a hero.

238
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,500
And we need a hero to move our plans along.

239
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:05,940
And who will deliver the Arabs? Their children 
cried for hunger, and still they chose war.

240
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:09,420
But I've rearranged some shipments.

241
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:14,010
When their children die of hunger, 
the Arabs will cry for peace.

242
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:16,600
It's all coming together perfectly.

243
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:21,440
Assuming of course, that you've taken care 
of your security problems.

244
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,390
Dirk Burton.

245
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:38,110
Used to be an Info-Tactic advisor for the Pentagon 
before he joined my Manhattan office.

246
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:41,070
Regretably, he's found it hard to get off 
his meddling ways.

247
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:44,250
Well I'll have to say that Mr. Burton

248
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:47,240
will have to sacrifice his pension

249
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:49,950
and his health benefits.

250
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,850
Check the yaw damper?

251
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:13,520
Check.

252
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:18,240
Let's use 287.

253
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:25,740
<I>Leaders praised J. Stonagal for his 
humanitarian efforts.</I>

254
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:29,120
<I>Cothran fights Third World hunger.</I>

255
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,940
Oh, you're cute.

256
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:45,350
I'll get a pillow for him.

257
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,260
There you go.

258
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,700
Somebody's getting sleepy!

259
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:04,700
You, would you like a pillow? How's that?

260
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:20,330
You wake my passengers and you'll be 
serving them coffee.

261
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:23,880
Sorry.

262
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,460
I know I've been a little anti-social this flight.

263
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:28,680
So, how's my favorite flight-attendant?

264
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:31,590
It's OK, Buck. I can always tell when 
you're working on a big story.

265
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:33,590
You kinda get this look.

266
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:38,190
Thank you again for making those phonecalls.

267
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:41,740
- I got the job.
- You did?

268
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,740
That's great. Congratulations!

269
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:46,300
It's gonna be a big change.
You're gonna knock 'em dead.

270
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:48,630
I can't wait.

271
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:51,480
You know, the UN's no picnic, especially right now.

272
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:55,280
And this is?

273
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:57,510
I thought it was going to be a quiet night.

274
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,880
- Coffee, guys?
 - Oh, absolutely!

275
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,330
- Black for me. 
- Ray?

276
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:11,850
Yeah, same for me.

277
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:14,710
So, what's this I hear about you leaving us?

278
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:21,950
What are going to take some time off?
 I'm taking the job at the UN.

279
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,320
- Tonight is my last flight.
- Why?

280
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,390
What did you just wanna change?
- I felt it was time to move on.

281
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,980
- What?
- Nothing.

282
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:58,900
So, when were you going to tell me about this?

283
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,610
One of us had to make a move.

284
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:04,740
And what is that supposed to mean?

285
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:06,970
It means I'm tired of waiting.

286
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:08,970
Tired of the looks and the flirting.

287
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:12,950
Waiting for you to give me a reason 
why I should stay.

288
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:15,340
Ah, Hattie.

289
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,560
Honey?

290
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:33,190
Where are you?

291
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,690
Mam?

292
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:39,150
Is everything OK?

293
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:42,250
It's my husband. He's disappeared.

294
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:49,990
You know what? I bet he just slipped off 
to the restroom while you were asleep.

295
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:51,990
Would you mind checking please?

296
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:54,530
OK, sure.

297
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,070
Take this.

298
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:03,840
I think he's gone off naked.

299
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:18,170
I'll be right back.

300
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:25,120
Honey?

301
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:27,380
Have you seen the kids?

302
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,160
Come on, I'm sleepy.

303
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,160
Where are they?

304
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:34,480
Where..Where are my kids?

305
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:48,330
Help! I can't find my kids.

306
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:52,690
I can't find my kids.

307
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:15,040
What's going on here?

308
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:30,820
- Ray!
- Well, that was perfect timing..

309
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:34,440
Ray, people are missing. Dozens of seats, empty.

310
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:37,050
Hattie, it's a big airplane. 
People are probably in the low.

311
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:39,270
I'm telling you. They are not here.

312
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:41,160
They're not anywhere.

313
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:46,700
Their shoes, their clothes, their glasses. It's crazy! 
We've all been left behind. The people are gone.

314
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:51,700
I'll be right back.

315
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:53,970
I am not nuts, Ray!

316
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:56,740
Go look for yourself.

317
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,970
My babies!

318
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:04,500
Have her calmed down! Just please take a seat.

319
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:06,580
Sit down, we'll find them.

320
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:09,020
I'm not leaving next!
 I'm not going next!

321
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,050
Hattie, try and get her a knee-cap.

322
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:13,450
Help.

323
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,240
I've got to get out of here.

324
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,470
I cannot leave this planet.

325
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:21,720
No,no,no, don't grab it!

326
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,510
I've gotta get out!

327
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:35,140
Nobody's gonna die.

328
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,250
Just take it easy. Take it easy..

329
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:39,030
OK? You're gonna be alright!

330
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:41,840
- What's going on, Captain?
- I don't know.

331
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,060
Just take it easy.

332
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:46,970
Hi Mum. It's me.

333
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:49,380
I just wanted to apologize for missing the party.

334
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:54,070
Oh, no!

335
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,320
Are you OK?

336
00:29:57,870 --> 00:30:01,470
The driver. There's no driver...

337
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:03,470
There! There!

338
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,470
It's OK. You're in shock.

339
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:08,880
Right over there.

340
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,610
My baby!

341
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,320
No!

342
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,480
What's happening? What's going on?

343
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:32,540
My baby! Did you see him?

344
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,190
He just vanished.

345
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:39,150
Please, please! Somebody help me!

346
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:41,150
My baby!

347
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:44,750
No! Anybody, please!

348
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:48,980
No! Please, somebody help me! Please!

349
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:51,540
Hey, that's my car!

350
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:53,540
Wait!

351
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:02,100
He stole my car!

352
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:04,940
Sit down. Please, everyone!

353
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:06,660
Lorry, Lorry, come over please.

354
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,900
Folks, listen to me, please!

355
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,870
We are at 12 km.

356
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:12,870
Nobody just walked off this airplane.

357
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:16,880
If I can get you to take your seats, we can 
solve the problems one at a time. Please.

358
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:20,210
Hattie, we've got to get these people 
back in their seats.

359
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:21,880
Start emergency procedures!

360
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,880
I'm so scared, what happened?

361
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,670
Just do it! I need you to do it! Just do it!

362
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:27,670
Hattie, come over here!

363
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:30,070
- Hey, I'll help!
- Sit down!

364
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:32,100
Sit down and take your seats!

365
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,950
Come on, let these people do their job!

366
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:38,950
Passenger emergency oxygen masks.

367
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:40,280
Cabin pressure is fine.

368
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,020
I know that. Do it now!

369
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:44,050
- But Ray?..
- I said do it now!

370
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:49,460
Everybody return to your seats and 
put on your oxygen masks!

371
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:11,350
Mayday, Mayday, this is Pan Com H907, Mayday!

372
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:13,350
Ray, what is going on?

373
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:15,350
"Concorde 2701."

374
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:17,490
"I assume you're missing passengers too?"

375
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:19,870
That's affirmative, Concorde. What is going on?

376
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,380
"I don't know, but it's everywhere."

377
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:23,530
Say again.

378
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:26,750
"We lost air-traffic controllers."

379
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:29,210
"Missing flight-crews."

380
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:31,890
"Flights are down all over."

381
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,460
We're turning back!

382
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:26,970
"Attention please! All flight have been 
canceled until further notice!"

383
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,910
"Your attention please!"

384
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:37,540
"The federal government has declared 
a national state of emergency."

385
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:41,170
"Please remain calm and stand by 
for further instructions."

386
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,890
Come on, Dirk! Come on.

387
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:53,670
"Circuits are busy. 
Please try again later."

388
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:57,510
"Your attention please!"

389
00:33:57,510 --> 00:34:01,230
"The federal government has declared 
a national state of emergency."

390
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:04,990
"Black or white, rich and pour, both here and abroad, 

391
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:09,370
"The death of the president adds to the 
list of world leaders dead or missing."

392
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:11,130
"Nikolai Carpathia:"

393
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:13,970
"The phenomenon unfortunately appears 
to be worldwide."

394
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:18,550
"While nations deal with the chaos 
within their borders..."

395
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:22,160
"..The UN has taken a leadership role 
in stabilizing the world"

396
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,790
"At this time.."

397
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:27,430
".. we do not know how many have disappeared."

398
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,670
"But what we do know.."

399
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:32,110
"Is that peace is imperative!"

400
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:34,110
"We must help our neighbours."

401
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:36,110
"Forget our differences."

402
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:38,470
"And we must do it now!"

403
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,250
Where are you going?

404
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:46,610
They're telling me that if I go now 
I might be able to get out.

405
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:48,380
Stay with me, please, I'm so scared.

406
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:50,140
I can't Hattie. I have to go home.

407
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:52,140
Please, Ray!

408
00:34:53,410 --> 00:34:55,210
I'm sorry.

409
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:57,210
Ray! Come on.

410
00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:01,420
I ju.. I'm really very sorry.

411
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:10,790
"Hi. Ivy Gold. Leave a message"

412
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:15,220
Ivy, it's me. Hey listen. I know the world 
is going nuts, but if you're there, I need your help.

413
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:17,630
I need you to find Dirk Burton!

414
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:20,550
I've got to talk to him. I think 
he may be on to something.

415
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:25,070
- Good luck!
- Take care.

416
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:29,790
Captain!

417
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:33,030
I've got to get to New-York. It's an emergency.

418
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:36,020
Afraid everybody's got an emergency right now.

419
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:38,030
But you don't understand.

420
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:41,630
Look! If I can get to New-York I 
can find some answers.

421
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:45,260
No. You don't understand how lucky 
we were to get to O'Hara.

422
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,720
All the other airports are shut down.

423
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,550
Come on. There's got to be some way.

424
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:51,910
Listen. I wouldn't have asked you if 
it wasn't so important.

425
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:54,080
All I care about right now is 
getting home to my family.

426
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,080
Will you excuse me, please?

427
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:03,240
Come on. Think! You've got to know 
someone who can help me get me out.

428
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:06,140
Alright. I guess I do owe you 
for saving my neck on the plane.

429
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:09,350
There's someone I know who's got a charter. 
Come on!

430
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:44,060
Irene? Honey?

431
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,350
Raymie?

432
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:59,530
Irene!

433
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:05,490
Hi Mum. It's me..

434
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:08,050
I just wanted to apologize for missing the party. 
I just have to..

435
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:10,050
Chloe?

436
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,810
Raymie! Son?

437
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:26,040
In the beginning

438
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:31,620
It's a little late for that.

439
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:42,730
Come on, Dirk, come on!

440
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:47,210
Please stay in your homes!

441
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:49,210
Is anyone there?

442
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:52,360
Security violators will be shot on sight!

443
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,720
Here's another one!

444
00:40:55,610 --> 00:40:57,110
Excuse me, I need to get to the air...

445
00:40:57,110 --> 00:40:59,770
Get back! Get back inside!

446
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:03,040
Now!. "We are all under martial-law"

447
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:06,980
"All citizens are to remain in their homes."

448
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:11,430
"The curfew is in effect until 6:00 AM."

449
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:50,530
Good luck, Miss.

450
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:21,830
Mum! Raymie?

451
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:29,610
Mum! Raymie!

452
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:34,310
Dad!

453
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:36,660
Dad!

454
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:47,930
As we deal with our own crisis,

455
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:53,720
We are very grateful that the UN is doing all 
that they can to  ind out who or what

456
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:56,400
is responsible for this horrible act of evil.

457
00:42:59,390 --> 00:43:01,850
How does this affect our food 
redistribution network?

458
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,820
Strangely enough all of our operatives 
are still in place.

459
00:43:15,810 --> 00:43:17,500
Unbelievable!

460
00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:19,890
The whole world turned upside down!

461
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:21,540
Yes..

462
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,650
Convenient, isn't it?

463
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:25,420
Joshua?

464
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:28,490
Never wait for opportunity to knock,

465
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:33,430
yank open the door, and drag it kicking 
and screaming inside.

466
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:58,350
Hold it right there! Don't move!

467
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:03,690
Buck Williams! What are you doing in my house?

468
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:06,360
Hoping you're not going to hit me with that vase?

469
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:12,290
What's happening?

470
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:15,270
My mother and brother...

471
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:19,190
You must be Chloe.

472
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:21,380
I'm sorry I scared you.

473
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:23,910
My mum and Raymie,

474
00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:26,580
I'm so scared for them.

475
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,040
I know.

476
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,450
I don't know of they're dead or lost.

477
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:34,440
It's like a nightmare.

478
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:38,010
How's your dad?

479
00:44:38,270 --> 00:44:40,660
He's passed out from exhaustion upstairs.

480
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:47,200
- Hey, it's OK.
- No, it's not OK!

481
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:53,560
No, it's not...

482
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:59,900
Listen. I've got to get to New York
if I'm going to find some answers.

483
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:02,310
Now your dad told me about a man...

484
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:04,880
Ritz.

485
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,600
Ken Ritz. He's a private pilot.

486
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:11,050
Can you tell me how to find him?

487
00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:18,070
- I'll take you there.
- No!

488
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:20,070
I can't let you go outside.

489
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:23,730
- It's madness out there!
- I'll go mad if I just sit here and do nothing.

490
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:29,100
Let's go.

491
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:36,130
One thing. If you find anything,
you let me know.

492
00:45:37,190 --> 00:45:39,180
I promise.

493
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:02,340
You want to sweeten the palm a bit, don't you.

494
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:05,020
I have 2000 dollars to San Francisco from the man 
in the blue shirt.

495
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:06,360
3000 dollar till Denver!

496
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:08,240
Sorry folks, cash only.

497
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:12,830
Now carry in mind that all commercial airports are shut 
down tight until further notice.

498
00:46:14,110 --> 00:46:16,330
4000 till Duboning. I've got diamonds.

499
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:20,340
25 000 for 48 hours.

500
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:22,600
25 000 large, huh?

501
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:25,010
Do I hear 30, anybody? Huh?

502
00:46:25,010 --> 00:46:26,780
Anybody?

503
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:28,780
Anybody?

504
00:46:29,430 --> 00:46:31,320
Done.

505
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:36,430
Hey Chloe, how are you?
506

506
00:46:36,430 --> 00:46:38,050
So, can you vouch for this guy?

507
00:46:38,050 --> 00:46:41,550
Well take a closer look, Kenny. He's Mr. GNN himself.

508
00:46:41,550 --> 00:46:45,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah. The guy who does the news update 
during football games, right?

509
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,960
- Hi.
- Nice hair.

510
00:46:48,070 --> 00:46:51,490
Well OK mister, you've bought yourself a pilot.
I'll see you in the office.

511
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:53,650
Come on, folks!

512
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:55,290
Don't forget your promise!

513
00:46:55,290 --> 00:46:57,250
As soon as I find something.

514
00:46:57,860 --> 00:47:00,520
- Thanks for the ride.
- You're welcome.

515
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:02,630
I hope you find some answers.

516
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:05,340
I hope you find your family.
Thanks..

517
00:47:12,670 --> 00:47:14,680
Aliens, that's what I think.

518
00:47:15,030 --> 00:47:17,540
I'm not talking little green men, this is
sophisticated.

519
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:19,880
You know, Area 51 stuff

520
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:21,910
Dematerialization.
521

521
00:47:22,890 --> 00:47:24,320
Like Star Trek?

522
00:47:24,410 --> 00:47:27,660
Come on. My theory's not wackier than some other
stuff floating around out there. 

523
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,440
Alternate dimensions.

524
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,590
Terrorist kidnappings.
525

525
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:33,750
Nostradamus prophecies.. Come on!

526
00:47:34,950 --> 00:47:35,220
Guy on the radio quoted a verse from the Bible.

527
00:47:35,450 --> 00:47:37,740
You know that story with the 2 men 
standing in the field?

528
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:39,740
One gets taken, and the other 
one's just left standing there?

529
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:42,680
Two women standing in the kitchen.

530
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:45,000
One gets taken, the other one's 
left doing the dishes.

531
00:47:47,450 --> 00:47:49,610
What do all the missing people have in common?

532
00:47:49,610 --> 00:47:53,540
Hell, all the kids are gone; 
take the Peter Pan story..

533
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:55,170
..but who's to blame the adults?

534
00:47:55,210 --> 00:48:00,690
So maybe something made all the children and adults,
selected adults, a target?

535
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:04,520
- Wouldn't they be easier to snatch?
- Could be blood-type.

536
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,980
Brainwaves, DNA, who knows.

537
00:48:08,810 --> 00:48:11,300
This is insane. People don't just disappear.

538
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:16,720
The real question is are they gone for good or 
will they be sent back.

539
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:22,050
Or worse: will more of us disappear?
I mean, how do you hide from something like this?

540
00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:27,450
Maybe the common factor isn't in those who were taken.

541
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:30,500
Maybe it's in those who were left behind.

542
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:32,500
Hey, news-guy!

543
00:49:10,270 --> 00:49:14,480
I have been going out of my mind driving all-over 
and looking for you! Why did you go?

544
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:17,630
I couldn't just sit there.

545
00:49:17,730 --> 00:49:19,710
What if they were hiding somewhere?

546
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:25,490
- I'm sorry.
- I checked the hospital and the police.

547
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:29,040
I'm so scared.

548
00:49:30,650 --> 00:49:33,960
- I only wish you tried the church.
- Yeah.

549
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:35,960
Don't start!

550
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:39,120
Well if your mom was right, nobody will be
there anyway, right?

551
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:41,120
Don't make fun of her, not right now!

552
00:49:41,550 --> 00:49:44,360
I'm not making fun of her. But think about.

553
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:47,060
Where did she spend most of her time?
 Where was she the happiest?

554
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:53,340
She was happiest when you were home.

555
00:49:58,650 --> 00:50:03,650
Chloe, the things your mom believed in, the things 
she talked about, what if they were true?

556
00:50:05,370 --> 00:50:07,050
I'm going home.

557
00:50:07,050 --> 00:50:10,390
Someone should be there when they come back.

558
00:50:21,370 --> 00:50:22,970
"I want to be a pilot like my dad."

559
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:42,380
Dirk?

560
00:50:54,270 --> 00:50:56,300
Dirk?

561
00:51:22,450 --> 00:51:24,460
Dirk!

562
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:28,000
Alan Thompkins?
What did he send you?

563
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:07,060
Oh, Lord!

564
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:12,360
Oh, God.

565
00:53:13,990 --> 00:53:16,000
What a fraud I am!

566
00:53:19,310 --> 00:53:21,340
And everybody bought it.

567
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:39,990
Except You!

568
00:53:39,990 --> 00:53:43,460
I knew Your message, I knew Your words!

569
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:51,120
I stood right here...

570
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:55,230
I preached it..

571
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:58,640
and I was good!

572
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:01,930
But they're gone!

573
00:54:03,930 --> 00:54:05,940
They're gone and..

574
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:12,330
Oh, the knowing and believing are 2 different things.

575
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:17,400
I'm living a lie.

576
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:20,340
I'm living a lie, right?

577
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:34,040
Oh, God!

578
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:39,200
I am kneeling before You..

579
00:54:40,030 --> 00:54:42,040
Right now, asking You..

580
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:47,430
God, forgive me of my sins.

581
00:54:50,150 --> 00:54:52,150
I am asking You..

582
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:56,640
Give me one more chance..

583
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,980
To receive You in.

584
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:05,070
Forgive me, God!

585
00:55:06,790 --> 00:55:09,660
Use me Lord! Please, just use me!

586
00:55:14,610 --> 00:55:16,610
He already has.

587
00:55:17,590 --> 00:55:19,580
He already has.

588
00:55:47,530 --> 00:55:50,120
Alan, are you still there? It's me.

589
00:55:50,730 --> 00:55:52,730
I need to know what Dirk Burton sent you.

590
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:54,960
Call me as soon as you can.

591
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:15,860
Hello! I'm pastor Vernon Billings of the New Hope 
Village Church.

592
00:56:16,770 --> 00:56:19,660
If you are watching this tape you are no doubt confused.

593
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:25,380
Let me encourage you. Your loved ones, your children,
your friends, your acquaintances,

594
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:30,630
have not been snatched away by some evil force
or by some invasion from outer space.

595
00:56:51,570 --> 00:56:54,140
- I thought you disappeared!
- I'm trying not to!

596
00:56:54,290 --> 00:56:56,270
Come on!

597
00:56:57,110 --> 00:56:59,110
What's going on?

598
00:57:00,730 --> 00:57:02,590
Someone tried to kill me!

599
00:57:03,850 --> 00:57:05,830
Was that before or after breakfast?

600
00:57:07,250 --> 00:57:08,800
I've got a lead on the vanishings.

601
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:11,440
It's shaky, it's insane,
it's all I've got.

602
00:57:13,490 --> 00:57:15,490
Let's see what Dirk died for.

603
00:57:23,390 --> 00:57:25,390
What the heck?
How did Dirk get that?

604
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:30,460
What's up with this?

605
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:33,790
These letters. D A N 7

606
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:36,350
It's some kind of code.

607
00:57:40,490 --> 00:57:42,510
What is that?

608
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:44,900
I don't know, but lets find out.

609
00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:49,670
UN, New York.

610
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:53,670
It's a miracle!

611
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:55,680
It all matches perfectly.

612
00:57:57,090 --> 00:57:59,120
Never in my life time..

613
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,480
I'll never forget you for this.

614
00:58:05,490 --> 00:58:07,490
Israel will never forget you.

615
00:58:09,020 --> 00:58:11,550
Thousands of years we've waited.

616
00:58:12,850 --> 00:58:14,830
Generation after generation.

617
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:17,190
And you have made it possible!

618
00:58:17,190 --> 00:58:19,190
Yes, my friend.

619
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:21,320
Now we are ready.

620
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:26,320
What? What? What's the matter?

621
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:28,070
It cannot be.

622
00:58:28,070 --> 00:58:30,080
We are surrounded by our enemies..

623
00:58:30,710 --> 00:58:33,500
there've been all these disappearances, so much turmoil..

624
00:58:33,770 --> 00:58:36,060
Your enemies will lay down their weapons..

625
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:38,390
when they have your formula. Our formula.

626
00:58:39,870 --> 00:58:41,710
We can do this, Chaim!

627
00:58:41,710 --> 00:58:43,710
You and I!

628
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:47,190
We can achieve the impossible.

629
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:55,360
No question. It's a diagram of Solomon's Temple.

630
00:58:56,170 --> 00:58:58,560
It's stand of a holy site in the jewish faith.

631
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:03,450
Jews have been trying to rebuild this temple ever since
the Romans destroyed it 2000 years ago.

632
00:59:03,830 --> 00:59:05,840
One of the holiest sites in the Muslim faith.

633
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:07,810
The dome of the rock.

634
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:11,970
Apparently both the Jews and the Arabs feel that this
particular hunk of rock is pretty sacred.

635
00:59:11,970 --> 00:59:14,520
It would cause a war if the Jews tried to buldoze it.

636
00:59:22,510 --> 00:59:24,490
OK ladies, here's what we need..

637
00:59:24,630 --> 00:59:26,640
Some sort of connection between the temple..

638
00:59:27,020 --> 00:59:28,570
the tracks of land,

639
00:59:28,570 --> 00:59:30,570
and the destroyed planes.

640
00:59:31,710 --> 00:59:35,560
I don't know what it is, but somehow all this stuff ties
together with Stonagal and Cochran.

641
00:59:36,460 --> 00:59:38,000
International bankers.

642
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,570
Always the same.

643
00:59:39,570 --> 00:59:41,570
Follow the money, honey!

644
00:59:45,890 --> 00:59:47,870
Chloe?

645
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:52,060
Sweetheart, I need to talk to you.

646
00:59:58,170 --> 01:00:00,170
I know where mum and Raymie are.

647
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:04,660
Where? Where are they?

648
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:07,420
They're in heaven with God.

649
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:10,830
Honey! Please!

650
01:00:12,250 --> 01:00:14,980
Remember when mum started to go to church
when grandma died?

651
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:17,270
- Yes?
- Remember what you said then?

652
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:19,350
Aren't you doing the same thing?

653
01:00:19,350 --> 01:00:21,300
Aren't you just using God as a crutch?

654
01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:23,300
Listen..I know what I said

655
01:00:23,350 --> 01:00:26,650
and I know this is hard to take
especially coming from me,

656
01:00:26,650 --> 01:00:29,520
and I don't blame you and I don't want you 
to take my word for it.

657
01:00:30,530 --> 01:00:32,440
Pastor Billings left a tape.

658
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:36,630
Chloe, I want you to take a look at that tape.
It explains everything.

659
01:00:38,370 --> 01:00:42,350
Do you remember when you told me you listened
to your mother and pretended to be interested?

660
01:00:42,350 --> 01:00:44,810
All I ask is that you do the same for me.

661
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:50,630
Just think about it.

662
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:05,370
We have confirmed that the disappearances have been caused by
 accumulated radiation from decades of nuclear testing.

663
01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:09,220
We have destroyed our own children.

664
01:01:09,780 --> 01:01:12,230
With our lust for violence and warfare.

665
01:01:12,620 --> 01:01:14,600
And it has to stop now!

666
01:01:14,870 --> 01:01:16,670
I am proposing..

667
01:01:16,670 --> 01:01:19,900
the complete and total disarmament and destruction

668
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:24,670
of all nuclear weapons by nations with
 nuclear capability.

669
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:28,160
At least somebody out there is making sense!

670
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:30,750
I am working closely with my dear friend..

671
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:32,810
...dr. Chaim Rosenzweig.

672
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:35,630
He has agreed to give his full support..

673
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:38,280
for UN peace initiative..

674
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:41,530
and a project to see..

675
01:01:41,730 --> 01:01:45,210
that every human mouth on Earth is being fed.

676
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:48,510
- That's a good man!
- Thank you. Thank you very much.

677
01:01:48,820 --> 01:01:50,820
Thank you.

678
01:01:51,270 --> 01:01:53,260
OK.

679
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:14,680
- Hattie!
- Hey!

680
01:02:15,750 --> 01:02:17,750
I wanted to check on you before I leave.

681
01:02:19,210 --> 01:02:20,830
How's your family?

682
01:02:20,830 --> 01:02:23,510
I still have my daughter Chloe,
but my wife and son..

683
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:28,100
I am so sorry.

684
01:02:29,990 --> 01:02:32,520
- Are you going somewhere?
- I'm going to the UN.

685
01:02:33,510 --> 01:02:35,640
The only place that offers any hope.

686
01:02:37,370 --> 01:02:39,370
Unless I have a reason to stay?

687
01:02:39,370 --> 01:02:44,240
- Hattie, I have made...
- Don't...please don't this do yourself.

688
01:02:44,670 --> 01:02:46,470
We all make mistakes..

689
01:02:46,470 --> 01:02:48,470
But it's not too late to start over.

690
01:02:48,470 --> 01:02:50,470
Clean fresh.

691
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:53,470
Yeah, I know what you've been through would crush anyone.

692
01:02:53,930 --> 01:02:55,940
- I can understand that.
- No, you don't.

693
01:02:56,420 --> 01:02:58,420
I'm a different person now.

694
01:03:00,650 --> 01:03:03,690
I should've listened to Irene. She tried to tell me,
but I wouldn't listen.

695
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:06,360
She was right! If I'd have listened,
I'd have known it.

696
01:03:07,630 --> 01:03:11,560
Everything I need in my life, 
everything I need to fulfill my life..

697
01:03:12,350 --> 01:03:14,330
Is right here!

698
01:03:14,330 --> 01:03:16,330
It's right here with my family.

699
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:18,990
- Do you understand?
- What?

700
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:23,180
- All this time?
- That's why I need...

701
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:26,650
- I need you to forgive me, I need to ask for..
- What are you talking about?

702
01:03:26,650 --> 01:03:32,250
- I was wrong.
- Ray, tell me, that what we feel is wrong?

703
01:03:34,190 --> 01:03:36,170
It's not about us.

704
01:03:36,170 --> 01:03:39,340
It's not. It's about something bigger and 
something better.

705
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:44,080
I really thought you were stronger than that.

706
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:46,080
Hattie, please! Hattie!

707
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:48,080
Wait, Hattie!

708
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:15,600
It's that why you never had time for us?

709
01:04:16,970 --> 01:04:18,980
No, it's not that at all.

710
01:04:19,290 --> 01:04:21,310
Then why don't you tell me what it is!

711
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:25,240
Honestly..

712
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:27,240
I'm not sure if I know..

713
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:29,240
My carrier, maybe my mortgage..

714
01:04:30,110 --> 01:04:32,710
Sometimes you get so wrapped up in life that you..

715
01:04:34,020 --> 01:04:37,270
Well, one day you wake up and you realise you've missed it.

716
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,950
You've missed out all the important things in life.

717
01:04:40,950 --> 01:04:42,590
Love is what we had, Chloe!

718
01:04:42,590 --> 01:04:46,170
Your mother loved me and you more than
we ever realized.

719
01:04:46,170 --> 01:04:49,850
I hated the church stuff and the people that would come
over..I resented her for that..

720
01:04:50,690 --> 01:04:53,990
Not because I didn't understand it, but 
because I didn't want her to need..

721
01:04:54,290 --> 01:04:56,320
anything more than she needed me.

722
01:04:59,210 --> 01:05:01,360
Mom had the answers..

723
01:05:01,850 --> 01:05:04,100
All she wanted to do was
share them with us.

724
01:05:04,530 --> 01:05:08,920
She was willing to suffer through the
jokes and the patronizing..

725
01:05:09,230 --> 01:05:11,050
and the coldness from me..

726
01:05:11,190 --> 01:05:13,180
just to help us.

727
01:05:16,540 --> 01:05:20,880
If I could go back before all of this happened,
if I could just..

728
01:05:21,410 --> 01:05:25,130
If I could take the clock and turn it back
a few minutes a day, I would!

729
01:05:25,130 --> 01:05:28,990
Are you telling me that they're dead? That they're
not coming back? - They're not coming back, baby.

730
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:35,430
Listen, your mother left us with the truth.

731
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:39,560
That there's something more, that
there's a greater love.

732
01:05:40,780 --> 01:05:42,790
She found that.

733
01:05:44,950 --> 01:05:47,410
And if she were here right now, 
that's what she'd be telling you.

734
01:05:49,510 --> 01:05:52,610
Are you sure this isn't just you feeling guilty
because of your friend?

735
01:05:52,810 --> 01:05:56,460
It's not about guilt. I won't live without faith 
anymore. I won't..

736
01:05:56,720 --> 01:06:00,220
Why? Because God will send you to hell?

737
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:03,030
Nice God!

738
01:06:03,030 --> 01:06:05,320
You get hell on Earth, and then
you get hell after.

739
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:08,010
Listen to me, sweetheart, it's
not about hell either.

740
01:06:08,010 --> 01:06:11,710
We were given a gift, Chloe, and we
blew it. It's not his fault!

741
01:06:14,390 --> 01:06:17,870
The ones that were believers are being spared
from what's coming next.

742
01:06:17,870 --> 01:06:19,870
What's coming?

743
01:06:20,660 --> 01:06:22,670
It's gonna get a lot worse.

744
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:26,920
What could be worse than this?

745
01:06:38,060 --> 01:06:40,720
Hey, Buck, we got something here!

746
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:43,870
- What? - The 10 tracks of land,
they all tie back to the UN.

747
01:06:43,870 --> 01:06:45,870
It's part of the disarmament and peace initiative.

748
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:47,900
Pretty cool, huh?

749
01:06:47,900 --> 01:06:49,900
So, they belong to the UN?

750
01:06:50,060 --> 01:06:53,110
All right, that's why you guys get 
the big bucks.

751
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:55,190
- Now, what's that got to do with Stonagal?
- There's more.

752
01:06:55,190 --> 01:06:57,700
There's an archaelogical foundation in Israel.

753
01:06:57,700 --> 01:06:59,570
All under-written by Stonagal's corporation.

754
01:06:59,570 --> 01:07:01,670
Your buddies, Stonagal and Cothran.

755
01:07:02,490 --> 01:07:05,280
Why is it these guys keep
coming up as good guys?

756
01:07:05,780 --> 01:07:07,810
Maybe they are.

757
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:12,680
- Hello!
- Hey, Buck!

758
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:14,680
- Alan, where are you?
- I'm in Chicago.

759
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:16,680
- I'm going to the airport.
- Chicago?

760
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:20,190
No, stay right there. 
I'm on my way.

761
01:07:20,190 --> 01:07:22,190
- All right.
- I'll call you from the plane.

762
01:07:55,980 --> 01:07:57,990
Because God loves you as much as I do

763
01:07:57,990 --> 01:07:59,580
Happy birthday, 
Love, Mom

764
01:08:17,420 --> 01:08:19,420
Here's some money. Fill her up.

765
01:08:20,390 --> 01:08:22,390
That's good.

766
01:08:23,030 --> 01:08:25,440
- Good to see you.
- How are you, man?

767
01:08:25,610 --> 01:08:28,610
OK, considering the circumstances.

768
01:08:29,870 --> 01:08:32,720
So, got any theories?

769
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:35,710
Officially, it's radiation.

770
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:40,850
Unofficially, the agencies are running scared
from the top down.

771
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:47,020
Look, about this bussiness at Dirk's place, are
 you sure you didn't get a look at the guy who shot you?

772
01:08:48,930 --> 01:08:51,590
You gotta figure he was the guy
that killed Dirk.

773
01:08:51,590 --> 01:08:55,360
Yeah. He was so careful, I thought he 
would outlast both of us.

774
01:08:55,620 --> 01:08:57,570
What has he got us into?

775
01:08:57,880 --> 01:08:59,860
I was hoping you could tell me.

776
01:09:00,410 --> 01:09:04,350
Look, this is all that I got from him.

777
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:10,630
So, is there anything here about the 
air strikes in Israel?

778
01:09:10,860 --> 01:09:14,110
No, it's financial stuff. Stonagal and Cothran
have been loaning billions..

779
01:09:14,110 --> 01:09:17,160
..to the UN for years and they're getting
ready to call the loan.

780
01:09:17,510 --> 01:09:19,330
To call the loans?

781
01:09:19,330 --> 01:09:21,340
What are they gonna do, bankrupt
the UN?

782
01:09:22,430 --> 01:09:25,800
It's insane, right? I mean,
what are they going to get?

783
01:09:25,990 --> 01:09:27,990
Ten useless tracks of land.

784
01:09:30,390 --> 01:09:32,400
Wait!

785
01:09:32,850 --> 01:09:35,730
Rosenzweig's formula! That's it!
The UN!

786
01:09:38,130 --> 01:09:40,320
That means they've been using Carpathia as a puppet!

787
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:44,090
You mean it's all about money?

788
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:49,600
Come on, you have to go now.
You've had enough fun for one day.

789
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:52,090
That's what Dirk was so crazy about!

790
01:09:52,090 --> 01:09:54,490
They're trying to control the world's food supply.

791
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:57,540
I've got to get to Chaim!

792
01:09:57,540 --> 01:09:59,950
Hey, hey, that's not gonna happen,
pal!

793
01:09:59,950 --> 01:10:03,170
Look, you let the agency handle it.
I'm going to get you to a safe house.

794
01:10:03,850 --> 01:10:07,830
- Listen, Chaim will listen to me!
- No, Buck!

795
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:12,560
I do not want to lose you too.

796
01:10:15,340 --> 01:10:16,860
OK.

797
01:10:16,860 --> 01:10:19,660
- Shouldn't take us too long to get to where we
need to go. 
- Good.

798
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:24,180
Can you spare a dollar for an old woman?
- Mam, mam..

799
01:10:24,180 --> 01:10:26,830
- Give me a dollar, that's..
- OK, OK...

800
01:10:26,830 --> 01:10:29,250
Come on, a dollar's not going
to break you.

801
01:10:30,420 --> 01:10:32,640
OK, I've got some change.

802
01:10:49,100 --> 01:10:51,110
Alan!

803
01:11:27,940 --> 01:11:31,040
I'm sorry to come here, but you're the only
ones they don't know!

804
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:33,040
Come in!

805
01:11:33,350 --> 01:11:35,330
My friends are dead. 

806
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:38,290
Get inside.

807
01:11:41,330 --> 01:11:44,560
I've gotta get to the UN and warn Chaim.

808
01:11:46,890 --> 01:11:49,890
They're trying to control the world's food..

809
01:11:50,950 --> 01:11:52,950
We gotta get him some help!

810
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:58,450
We're setting an emergency center at the
New Hope Church. We'll take him there.

811
01:12:02,130 --> 01:12:04,870
So you're researching the disappearence of
these people?

812
01:12:05,730 --> 01:12:10,430
And you say you're interested in finding out what
really happened to them?

813
01:12:12,860 --> 01:12:14,870
Take a look at this. 
It might help.

814
01:12:20,860 --> 01:12:23,950
You're watching this tape because millions
of people have disappeared.

815
01:12:23,950 --> 01:12:28,590
Babies and children still inocent in God's eyes
have vanished.

816
01:12:29,430 --> 01:12:33,130
There is much to fear, but not for
those who are missing.

817
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:39,700
Because they have placed their faith in Christ alone for
 salvation, they have been taken to heaven by Jesus himself.

818
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:45,530
1st Thessalonians tells us that the Lord himself
shall descend from heaven with a shout.

819
01:12:46,070 --> 01:12:51,490
With the voice of the archangel and with the trump of
God, and the dead in Christ shall rise first.

820
01:12:51,490 --> 01:12:58,440
Then we who are live and remaining will be caught together 
with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air.

821
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:01,290
And so shall we ever be with the Lord!

822
01:13:03,950 --> 01:13:07,580
What's this? Some guy thinks the Bible has
some explanation for the vanishings?

823
01:13:08,090 --> 01:13:10,090
This doesn't sound convincing to you?

824
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:13,800
Oh, come on, those scriptures are so vague,
they could mean anything.

825
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:16,840
There's something else I should tell you.

826
01:13:17,670 --> 01:13:19,710
Pastor Billings vanished with the rest of them.

827
01:13:20,420 --> 01:13:22,420
I helped him make this tape 3 years ago.

828
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:24,750
3 years ago?

829
01:13:25,710 --> 01:13:28,360
That's impossible! 
How could he have known?

830
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:33,680
It's all in here. Including that!

831
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:37,410
- Ezekiel 38.
- Those codes!

832
01:13:38,290 --> 01:13:41,030
- They're Bible verses.
- 38th chapter, Ezekiel.

833
01:13:41,030 --> 01:13:45,570
God promised to help Israel from total
annihilation by her enemies from the north.

834
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:48,730
Miraculously.

835
01:13:52,830 --> 01:13:55,550
It's all in there.
Exactly as you witnessed it.

836
01:13:57,700 --> 01:14:03,260
What about this one? These 10 tracks of land
are about to belong to Jonathan Stonagal.

837
01:14:05,510 --> 01:14:08,300
- What does your Bible say about that?
- It's Daniel 7.

838
01:14:08,540 --> 01:14:10,560
The rapture. The vanishings.

839
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:13,910
This marks the beginning of the rise
of the Antichrist.

840
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:17,710
He will control 10 kingdoms, which
in turn will control the world.

841
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:22,440
Yeah, but 10 tracks of useless real estate doesn't
seem like much of a kingdom for me.

842
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:25,400
Unless they have the Eden formula.

843
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:26,410
What?

844
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:29,050
Stonagal has a plan that will unlock the world's
food supply.

845
01:14:29,660 --> 01:14:31,640
And this?

846
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:34,260
2 Thessalonians 2.

847
01:14:34,260 --> 01:14:39,680
And the Antichrist will sit in the Temple of God
and will declare to the whole world that he is God.

848
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:41,680
The Temple of God?

849
01:14:41,890 --> 01:14:44,550
You're talking about Solomon's temple
in Jerusalem, aren't you?

850
01:14:44,750 --> 01:14:47,060
- That's right.
- Whoever this Antichrist guy is...

851
01:14:47,060 --> 01:14:50,340
He's gonna have a big war on his hands if
he tries to rebuild this temple any time soon.

852
01:14:50,340 --> 01:14:54,420
Listen to what I'm saying to you. Make no
mistake about it. I's written in the Scriptures.

853
01:14:54,980 --> 01:14:57,000
He will rebuild the temple.

854
01:14:57,890 --> 01:14:59,500
I guarantee it.

855
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:02,560
But the arabs are not just gonna sit by and
watch them build this thing.

856
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:06,220
- They'll make peace with Israel.
- Peace? In the Middle East?

857
01:15:06,220 --> 01:15:08,220
Daniel 9:27.

858
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:11,060
And he will confirm a covenant with many for 
7 years.

859
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:20,730
Alright, listen, I admit, this
stuff is compelling.

860
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:24,630
Even scary. We can't just sit here.

861
01:15:25,650 --> 01:15:28,150
Alright, nothing is gonna change if somebody
doesn't do something.

862
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,010
Buck, hold on! Wait! 

863
01:15:38,930 --> 01:15:41,720
Buck! Buck, where are you going?

864
01:15:42,900 --> 01:15:44,900
No, I can't.

865
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:48,330
I've gotta get to the UN and
I've gotta warn Chaim.

866
01:15:49,330 --> 01:15:52,970
Wait a minute, how are going to warn him?
You won't even know the truth!

867
01:15:53,550 --> 01:15:57,790
The Bible says that if you don't put your
faith in God you will be deceived!

868
01:15:58,690 --> 01:16:00,670
What? You think you being here is
an accident?

869
01:16:01,460 --> 01:16:03,370
You know what I'm talking about.

870
01:16:03,370 --> 01:16:05,370
You can feel Him.

871
01:16:05,490 --> 01:16:07,500
You can feel God tugging at your heart.

872
01:16:11,860 --> 01:16:13,860
Don't ignore Him, Buck!

873
01:16:21,470 --> 01:16:23,580
Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your
attention, please?

874
01:16:25,630 --> 01:16:30,260
Ladies and gentlemen, it's official. Nikolai Carpathia
will be our new Secretary General.

875
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,010
We'll get you in the main auditorium in 
a few minutes.

876
01:16:34,010 --> 01:16:37,510
Mr. Carpathia will make a statement and then
we'll have a couple of minutes for questions.

877
01:16:37,510 --> 01:16:39,510
Thank you very much.

878
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:47,570
Mr Williams! The Media room is this way!

879
01:16:47,570 --> 01:16:48,940
No, I'm going to see Chaim Rosenzweig!

880
01:16:48,940 --> 01:16:51,030
My orders are to make sure that
he's undisturbed.

881
01:16:51,030 --> 01:16:53,100
I'll personally escort Mr. Williams.

882
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:55,100
I have my orders, Ms. Durham.

883
01:16:55,220 --> 01:16:57,900
You are aware that I act on Mr.
Carpathia's behalf?

884
01:16:58,430 --> 01:17:02,140
Of course. My apologies, Mr. Williams,
Ms. Durham..

885
01:17:06,780 --> 01:17:08,760
I owe it all to you, Buck!

886
01:17:08,930 --> 01:17:10,610
Nikolai is a huge fan of yours.

887
01:17:10,610 --> 01:17:14,180
When they saw your letter of reference, I
was asked to join the staff.

888
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:17,130
He's a great man!

889
01:17:17,180 --> 01:17:19,280
There's no question this is the right place to be..

890
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:22,880
for both of us.

891
01:17:24,490 --> 01:17:27,700
Buck! I was hoping to see you here.

892
01:17:27,700 --> 01:17:32,830
I can't think of anyone more perfect to tell
the story of this histori making announcement.

893
01:17:33,190 --> 01:17:35,260
I'm here to keep you from making a horrible
mistake.

894
01:17:38,390 --> 01:17:40,180
Please, sit down.

895
01:17:40,190 --> 01:17:46,330
OK, make sure the announcement goes worldwide,
full media saturation, repeated every 30 minutes!

896
01:17:46,330 --> 01:17:48,330
Already in motion.

897
01:17:48,740 --> 01:17:51,810
Do you see? Stonagal and Cothran have been
lying to you.

898
01:17:52,460 --> 01:17:53,960
Eden is part of their plan.

899
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:58,450
But I'm turning over my formula to a consortium
of UN delegates.

900
01:17:58,450 --> 01:18:00,400
- It's our only hope now.
- It doesn't matter.

901
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:03,700
Once they bankrupt the UN, Stonagal and
Cothran will own it all!

902
01:18:04,310 --> 01:18:06,320
The land and the formula.

903
01:18:08,340 --> 01:18:11,060
They will control the entire world's food supply.

904
01:18:13,390 --> 01:18:15,420
We must tell Carpathia.

905
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:23,640
Can this be true?

906
01:18:23,790 --> 01:18:25,950
They've used our dreams against us, Nikolai!

907
01:18:30,260 --> 01:18:32,740
It seems so unthinkable.

908
01:18:34,290 --> 01:18:37,210
Once the story hits, the whole world
will know the truth.

909
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:40,100
It's not that easy.

910
01:18:40,100 --> 01:18:42,110
These men were my mentors.

911
01:18:44,240 --> 01:18:46,270
And my friends.

912
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:49,510
Sir, they're murderers!

913
01:18:51,890 --> 01:18:54,910
Buck, you have no reason to lie.

914
01:18:56,130 --> 01:18:58,130
Ms. Durham!

915
01:19:02,170 --> 01:19:05,310
E-mail this to Mr. Williams' office, tell them it's
me, top priority.

916
01:19:05,970 --> 01:19:08,380
This information must be broadcasted 
immediately.

917
01:19:08,740 --> 01:19:10,360
Thank you, Mr. Carpathia.

918
01:19:10,360 --> 01:19:12,980
Do not worry. You're under my protection 
now.

919
01:19:28,220 --> 01:19:30,230
Excuse me, what's that?

920
01:19:31,510 --> 01:19:35,040
Ah, this is a dream come true for all of Israel.

921
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:37,040
Plans to rebuild our temple.

922
01:19:39,690 --> 01:19:43,790
The temple? But, but, the Muslims,
they'll never allow this!

923
01:19:44,050 --> 01:19:47,850
No, no. The true site of the original temple
has been found.

924
01:19:48,150 --> 01:19:51,150
It will stand next to their Mosque. 

925
01:19:51,810 --> 01:19:53,790
Perfect harmony.

926
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:56,730
It's a wonderful moment, don't you think?

927
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:59,210
We will be set to break the ground.

928
01:20:02,140 --> 01:20:04,160
In light of all this..

929
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:06,160
We move forward.

930
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:09,440
We announce the sharing of
food with the world.

931
01:20:09,700 --> 01:20:12,350
And the building of this Jewish temple
as a symbol.

932
01:20:13,390 --> 01:20:16,690
Not just for jews, but for every 
man and woman.

933
01:20:16,690 --> 01:20:18,690
For the whole humanity.

934
01:20:19,230 --> 01:20:22,200
This marks the beginning of our 7
years of peace.

935
01:20:23,930 --> 01:20:25,400
It can't be!

936
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:28,850
Now, despite your doubts, this is
going to be a great day, Buck!

937
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:31,880
The stage is set, gentlemen.

938
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:34,350
Let us change history.

939
01:20:34,900 --> 01:20:36,910
Thank you for everything you've done.

940
01:20:43,660 --> 01:20:45,640
Chaim, you want this built?

941
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:50,580
Yes of course. This is the reason for our
leaders to sign the peace treaty.

942
01:20:50,580 --> 01:20:53,380
Do you have any idea what this means?

943
01:20:55,940 --> 01:20:57,940
I thought I did.

944
01:21:00,070 --> 01:21:02,070
Excuse me.

945
01:21:02,070 --> 01:21:04,070
Are you alright?

946
01:21:05,750 --> 01:21:07,750
Sweetheart, are you alright?

947
01:21:09,020 --> 01:21:11,560
I just feel so helpless.
I wish he'd call or something.

948
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:15,640
Well he has to find the truth on his own.

949
01:21:17,780 --> 01:21:20,990
I know. I just wish there was something
we could do.

950
01:21:26,900 --> 01:21:29,420
We can ask God to help him find his way.

951
01:21:42,890 --> 01:21:44,910
It's true.

952
01:21:55,220 --> 01:21:57,220
All of it is true.

953
01:22:55,690 --> 01:22:57,690
God!

954
01:23:00,710 --> 01:23:02,710
I'be never prayed before.

955
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,010
I don't know what to say.

956
01:23:12,410 --> 01:23:14,410
I'm so sorry. Please, forgive me.

957
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:21,590
I just know I need You.

958
01:23:26,130 --> 01:23:28,100
And I believe.

959
01:23:35,080 --> 01:23:37,080
Just show me what to do.

960
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:19,800
Mr. Williams, there you are!

961
01:24:21,620 --> 01:24:23,630
- Are you OK?
- Yes.

962
01:24:24,900 --> 01:24:26,070
Come.

963
01:24:26,070 --> 01:24:29,570
We were about to go into this meeting 
before the big press conference,

964
01:24:29,570 --> 01:24:32,970
and I need you there when I confront
Mr. Stonagal and Mr. Cothran.

965
01:24:33,860 --> 01:24:36,060
You will see justice done here today!
Don't worry!

966
01:24:36,640 --> 01:24:38,640
Carl, stay close to Mr. Williams.

967
01:24:50,030 --> 01:24:52,650
Ladies and gentlemen, I apologize for
the delay.

968
01:24:53,690 --> 01:24:55,690
Please, be sitted.

969
01:25:00,810 --> 01:25:02,800
Mr. Williams, please join us.

970
01:25:06,930 --> 01:25:11,350
Mr. Carpathia, we agreed there would be no
media at this conference.

971
01:25:11,550 --> 01:25:15,650
Mr. Williams will be joining our delegation as its
own media liaison.

972
01:25:15,710 --> 01:25:18,600
These changes should have been discussed
beforehand.

973
01:25:19,390 --> 01:25:20,550
With us.

974
01:25:20,550 --> 01:25:27,730
Mr. William's journalistic credentials have always shown 
him to be a man only interested in learning the truth.

975
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:34,910
That is what we are all interested in here, the
truth, won't you all agree?

976
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:47,850
We are about to turn this planet
into a paradise!

977
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:51,390
Unimaginable only a few short weeks ago.

978
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:56,240
Ten oasis regions.

979
01:25:56,520 --> 01:26:01,700
Where each delegate is given complete control over
his respective area.

980
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:05,810
True global community.

981
01:26:06,740 --> 01:26:08,820
A true world of peace.

982
01:26:12,830 --> 01:26:14,860
This marks the beginning

983
01:26:15,500 --> 01:26:18,240
of our 7 years of peace.

984
01:26:18,460 --> 01:26:20,490
"of 7 years"

985
01:26:21,430 --> 01:26:24,340
"This marks the beginning of the rise
of the Antichrist."

986
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:27,270
"He will control 10 kingdoms.."

987
01:26:28,640 --> 01:26:30,720
"..which in turn will control the world."

988
01:26:34,310 --> 01:26:39,800
"The Antichrist will sit in the Temple of God and
he will declare to the whole world that he is God."

989
01:26:41,260 --> 01:26:45,880
Upon each of you I grant all the power 
and authority..

990
01:26:45,880 --> 01:26:47,880
..due to your new positions.

991
01:26:48,490 --> 01:26:52,180
You are now kings and queens
in your own lands.

992
01:26:52,450 --> 01:26:56,390
Bringing prosperity and plenty
to your people.

993
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:00,820
All in my name.

994
01:27:01,630 --> 01:27:06,100
What are you saying, Nikolai?
We never agreed to this!

995
01:27:08,580 --> 01:27:12,670
In the garden, there was a serpent
who tempted Eve.

996
01:27:13,330 --> 01:27:16,350
Leading to man's banishment from paradise.

997
01:27:18,100 --> 01:27:21,870
That serpent has stood between us and 
paradise ever since.

998
01:27:22,260 --> 01:27:24,260
What's this about, Carpathia?

999
01:27:24,710 --> 01:27:26,720
It's about you 2.

1000
01:27:27,430 --> 01:27:32,350
Serpents in my garden. Using unity and
prosperity for your own gain.

1001
01:27:34,730 --> 01:27:37,150
Nikolai, you know, that's preposterous.

1002
01:27:37,370 --> 01:27:39,400
Do not lie to me!

1003
01:27:42,650 --> 01:27:46,180
So small!..so easily manipulated!

1004
01:27:47,090 --> 01:27:50,210
Tell me Jonathan, who is the 
puppet here?

1005
01:27:51,830 --> 01:27:53,940
Look where I am, and look
where you are.

1006
01:27:54,240 --> 01:27:58,610
Do you have any idea, do you know
who you're dealing with?

1007
01:27:59,800 --> 01:28:01,800
Do you?

1008
01:28:03,300 --> 01:28:06,160
I welcome all of you to join this great team.

1009
01:28:07,810 --> 01:28:09,810
Do you accept my invitation?

1010
01:28:12,070 --> 01:28:15,100
We made you, Nikolai. You're
our creation!

1011
01:28:16,740 --> 01:28:18,750
I see!

1012
01:28:22,620 --> 01:28:25,010
Donald M. Otterness?

1013
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:27,240
Yes sir, that's me.

1014
01:28:27,240 --> 01:28:29,240
Of New York, New Jersey?

1015
01:28:29,240 --> 01:28:30,920
Why, yes sir.

1016
01:28:30,920 --> 01:28:32,920
May I call you Don?

1017
01:28:34,090 --> 01:28:36,430
Don, give me your sidearm.

1018
01:28:42,340 --> 01:28:45,300
So begins an object lesson in
leadership.

1019
01:28:45,530 --> 01:28:47,540
Nikolai.

1020
01:28:47,690 --> 01:28:49,670
Have you lost your mind?
What are you doing?

1021
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:53,880
- Nikolai!
- Sit down, Chaim.

1022
01:29:02,940 --> 01:29:07,020
Look, we all want the same thing, right?

1023
01:29:07,700 --> 01:29:09,710
I'm sure you're right.

1024
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:13,530
Ms. Durham, could you please step back?

1025
01:29:13,890 --> 01:29:15,900
I wouldn't want that suit to be soiled.

1026
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:22,490
On your knees, Johnathan!

1027
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:26,420
No! No, I will do no such thing!

1028
01:29:34,990 --> 01:29:37,080
- Someone has to stop this!
- Buck!

1029
01:29:38,920 --> 01:29:40,910
We're all on the same team.

1030
01:29:41,490 --> 01:29:43,490
Are we not?

1031
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:53,690
People will know that I fear no one.

1032
01:29:53,990 --> 01:29:58,490
That I fear nothing! That I will succeed
at anythingI set my mind to!

1033
01:29:58,810 --> 01:30:02,040
Without the slightest hesitation or opposition.

1034
01:30:03,120 --> 01:30:06,300
From this day forth, no one can
stand against me!

1035
01:30:06,980 --> 01:30:10,200
That's the kind of power you lusted
for, Jonathan!

1036
01:30:11,550 --> 01:30:15,080
Don't worry. 
This will be completely painless.

1037
01:30:16,070 --> 01:30:18,850
After all, I am not a monster.

1038
01:30:20,710 --> 01:30:22,710
No, Nikolai, please!

1039
01:30:32,150 --> 01:30:36,590
I was so shocked when I saw Mr. Stonagal 
thrust a guard and take his gun

1040
01:30:37,120 --> 01:30:42,210
and murder his dear friend Mr. Cothran
in cold blood.

1041
01:30:42,540 --> 01:30:45,460
Then, to watch him turn the gun 
on himself,

1042
01:30:46,330 --> 01:30:48,350
it seemed inconceivable.

1043
01:30:49,720 --> 01:30:51,730
But Jonathan was a troubled man.

1044
01:30:52,360 --> 01:30:54,700
Played by guilt, fear.

1045
01:30:55,710 --> 01:31:00,810
And when he heard Mr. Williams was about to expose
him, he knew that it was over.

1046
01:31:01,240 --> 01:31:04,770
He knew that his hideous and evil plan
would come out,

1047
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:11,900
and that his life, legacy, everything he worked
so long and hard for, would be ruined.

1048
01:31:15,010 --> 01:31:19,930
I know you wanted to do that,
for Dirk and Alan.

1049
01:31:22,470 --> 01:31:26,040
But I couldn't have my new media liaison
with blood on his hands.

1050
01:31:28,260 --> 01:31:30,290
I have big plans for you, Buck.

1051
01:31:30,840 --> 01:31:35,680
That story I sent to the GNN about Stonagal
and Cothran should be airing now any moment.

1052
01:31:36,620 --> 01:31:39,490
The whole world will feel sympathy and
love for me,

1053
01:31:39,490 --> 01:31:41,800
and they will follow me
wherever I lead them.

1054
01:31:43,140 --> 01:31:45,150
Because of you.

1055
01:31:45,800 --> 01:31:47,810
So thank you, Buck.

1056
01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:51,390
Thank you.

1057
01:31:54,540 --> 01:31:56,570
I think we are all in agreement.

1058
01:31:59,180 --> 01:32:03,280
Two lives taken in tragedy.

1059
01:32:06,150 --> 01:32:08,160
All because of greed.

1060
01:32:10,230 --> 01:32:12,240
How terribly sad!

1061
01:32:15,060 --> 01:32:18,100
- Terribly sad!
- Terribly sad!

1062
01:32:18,150 --> 01:32:21,450
- Terribly sad!
- Terribly sad!

1063
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:23,800
- Terribly sad!

1064
01:32:31,850 --> 01:32:33,850
It's time to change history!

1065
01:32:40,440 --> 01:32:43,360
- Nobody move!
- Johnathan! Johnathan!

1066
01:32:43,720 --> 01:32:45,720
Oh, now!

1067
01:32:46,990 --> 01:32:48,990
Why?

1068
01:32:50,040 --> 01:32:52,420
Ladies and gentlemen! Get back, please!

1069
01:32:53,160 --> 01:32:56,020
Both dead. Let's get the delegates out
of here right now. 

1070
01:32:56,200 --> 01:32:59,900
Ladies and gentlemen, please, clear this room
now! This way, please!

1071
01:32:59,900 --> 01:33:03,150
- Are you OK?
- Seal all doors. Lock this place down now!

1072
01:33:03,530 --> 01:33:05,540
Get back right now!

1073
01:33:11,410 --> 01:33:13,420
Chaim! Chaim!

1074
01:33:15,420 --> 01:33:17,400
What did you see?

1075
01:33:18,360 --> 01:33:22,300
I saw Mr. Stonagal grab the gun from
 the guard's belt,

1076
01:33:22,830 --> 01:33:28,060
shoot Mr. Cothran. And then he shouted something
about wanting forgiveness.

1077
01:33:28,900 --> 01:33:31,380
Then turned the gun on himself.
So awful!

1078
01:33:32,270 --> 01:33:34,250
You saw it!

1079
01:33:35,030 --> 01:33:37,040
Chaim! Nikolai!

1080
01:33:38,380 --> 01:33:41,300
- What about Nikolai?
- Oh, the poor man..

1081
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:44,780
He was so deceived, he was so
heart-broken.

1082
01:33:45,960 --> 01:33:48,630
Imagine, his own best friends!

1083
01:33:58,980 --> 01:34:01,010
Buck! Buck, are you OK?

1084
01:34:01,590 --> 01:34:04,200
- Hattie, this is unbelievable!
- I know, it's horrible!

1085
01:34:04,200 --> 01:34:06,200
So tragic.

1086
01:34:06,290 --> 01:34:08,310
When Stonagal grabbed that gun..

1087
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:12,530
Hattie!

1088
01:34:13,540 --> 01:34:15,870
- Hattie, you are in such..
- I know..

1089
01:34:17,240 --> 01:34:19,250
Privileged position.

1090
01:34:19,730 --> 01:34:21,730
I intend to do whatever I can to 
help Nikolai.

1091
01:34:23,020 --> 01:34:25,050
He's a great man.

1092
01:34:33,400 --> 01:34:35,400
I have to go.

1093
01:34:47,250 --> 01:34:52,810
What is evident is the courage of Nikolai Carpathia
in exposing this evil plan..

1094
01:34:53,240 --> 01:34:58,150
And yet the head of UN continues to show no
regard for his own personal safety,

1095
01:34:58,770 --> 01:35:03,530
and yet has vowed to press forward with
his peace initiatives and disarmaments.

1096
01:35:03,890 --> 01:35:09,490
In a world sadly lacking of leadership, Carpathia
stands out as a beacon of hope for the lost.

1097
01:35:12,420 --> 01:35:14,440
Everything the Bible predicted is
happening.

1098
01:35:15,860 --> 01:35:20,480
If this is true, and the Antichrist is coming to
power, then this is just the beginning.

1099
01:35:21,650 --> 01:35:25,150
The next 7 years are going to be the worst
that mankind has ever seen.

1100
01:35:27,030 --> 01:35:29,030
Our only hope is to join together..

1101
01:35:29,580 --> 01:35:31,590
.. and trust God.

1102
01:35:33,180 --> 01:35:35,190
I don't have all the answers.

1103
01:35:35,670 --> 01:35:38,610
But for now, faith is enough.
