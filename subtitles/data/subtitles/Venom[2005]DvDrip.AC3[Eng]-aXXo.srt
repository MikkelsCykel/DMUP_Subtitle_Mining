1
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,388
I feel great, man.
I get it. You live in an armpit.

2
00:02:53,454 --> 00:02:56,299
What is so wrong with this town, huh?

3
00:02:56,365 --> 00:02:58,665
Besides archaic beliefs
and backward mentality?

4
00:02:58,731 --> 00:03:00,617
Hey, come on, I like it here.

5
00:03:00,682 --> 00:03:02,437
- Sean?
- What?

6
00:03:02,505 --> 00:03:07,291
We're almost drunk.
Can we have a little more booze, please?

7
00:03:08,837 --> 00:03:11,553
- That's all.
- You're the best.

8
00:03:12,578 --> 00:03:15,872
So you're just gonna stare at her
through plate glass all night?

9
00:03:15,937 --> 00:03:18,205
She doesn't want to talk.

10
00:03:18,272 --> 00:03:21,020
- I can tell by her posture.
- Pos...

11
00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:27,032
Did you see that?

12
00:03:35,733 --> 00:03:37,620
Eden.

13
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:40,300
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

14
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:43,020
No, it started raining.

15
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:47,276
- You and Eric will work everything out.
- Oh, yeah? How's that?

16
00:03:47,342 --> 00:03:51,050
Hm... I have a feeling
for these kind of things.

17
00:04:10,689 --> 00:04:12,957
Have some.

18
00:04:20,987 --> 00:04:23,855
Hey, Ray.
How are you doing tonight?

19
00:04:27,127 --> 00:04:31,118
- All right, I guess.
- Got your order all ready.

20
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,961
Here you go, Ray.
Have a good one.

21
00:04:44,174 --> 00:04:47,433
- That man gives me the weebies.
- It's just a scar, Rachel.

22
00:04:47,499 --> 00:04:51,010
Forget the scar.
It's his eyes, the way he stares you down.

23
00:04:51,081 --> 00:04:52,836
Freaky.

24
00:05:45,097 --> 00:05:48,391
So tell me, is that synthetic leather?

25
00:05:49,191 --> 00:05:51,262
We got it at Lacey's in Baton Rouge.

26
00:05:51,334 --> 00:05:56,034
<i>You got it at Lacey's. I was in Barnes and
Noble. Do not make me part of your felony.</i>

27
00:05:56,099 --> 00:05:59,675
- You stole it?
- Well, I wasn't gonna buy it. It's too ugly.

28
00:05:59,745 --> 00:06:02,493
And I felt bad taking a nice one.
I have a conscience.

29
00:06:02,559 --> 00:06:05,524
- You're still a crook.
- Yeah, a crook with a nice rack.

30
00:06:05,597 --> 00:06:08,181
Don't you think?

31
00:06:09,403 --> 00:06:12,663
You may not want
to pull those out too often.

32
00:06:12,729 --> 00:06:15,095
- Ray!
- What are you doing? Stop!

33
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,199
- Ray! Hey, Ray!
- Tammy!

34
00:06:17,271 --> 00:06:21,163
- Yeah, you like that?
- Tammy! That redneck ain't right.

35
00:06:21,236 --> 00:06:24,082
So long, sucker!

36
00:06:38,634 --> 00:06:42,015
- Come on.
- You're not touching my hair.

37
00:06:42,088 --> 00:06:45,435
What?
You don't trust me? I'm offended.

38
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:50,362
Mitzi said if I get my license, she'll give me
a chair and I can build up my clientele.

39
00:06:50,435 --> 00:06:53,335
Mitzi will have to die
before you get a clientele.

40
00:06:53,409 --> 00:06:57,302
She rolls around on a stool now, cutting
hair and doing color. It will not be long.

41
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,284
I can wait.

42
00:07:00,158 --> 00:07:03,320
- That's getting embarrassing.
- Tuition, car payment.

43
00:07:03,388 --> 00:07:05,558
Tuition, car payment.

44
00:07:05,626 --> 00:07:07,730
"Who's the scrub on the bike?"

45
00:07:07,801 --> 00:07:10,483
"Oh, that's Dr. Sinclair.
She clips coupons, too."

46
00:07:10,968 --> 00:07:13,933
- Good night, Rachel.
- Good night, Eden.

47
00:08:44,033 --> 00:08:46,366
Eden.

48
00:08:46,431 --> 00:08:48,699
Eden, come on.

49
00:09:00,983 --> 00:09:03,632
- What's going on?
- You broke up with me, Eric.

50
00:09:03,701 --> 00:09:06,067
What are you talking about?
You broke up with me.

51
00:09:06,132 --> 00:09:08,683
I said we should
get serious about me going away.

52
00:09:08,754 --> 00:09:10,215
Yeah, to LSU, not Columbia.

53
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:12,394
The grants came through.
What was I meant to do?

54
00:09:12,465 --> 00:09:16,968
How about telling me
you applied to Columbia in the first place?

55
00:09:17,037 --> 00:09:18,825
I knew you'd get upset.

56
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:22,851
Oh, so you'd announce one day, "Oh, by
the way, I'm going to school in New York."

57
00:09:22,922 --> 00:09:26,913
Not Baton Rouge like we'd planned. We
were gonna see each other on weekends.

58
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:30,778
There is nothing here for me.
I mean, you have your dad's business.

59
00:09:30,853 --> 00:09:33,056
Be realistic.
I'm gonna have to move away.

60
00:09:33,124 --> 00:09:35,294
Listen.
You can't be a doctor here?

61
00:09:35,363 --> 00:09:37,728
I don't want this town.

62
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,297
Are you sure?

63
00:09:44,253 --> 00:09:46,194
Or is it me you don't want?

64
00:09:53,688 --> 00:09:55,923
Great.

65
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:06,151
Everything OK here?

66
00:10:06,225 --> 00:10:10,957
Actually, Ray, we're kind of in the middle
of something, you know? Private.

67
00:10:11,022 --> 00:10:13,987
- Is this boy giving you trouble?
- No.

68
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:17,702
No, Ray, it's OK.
We're just talking.

69
00:10:18,569 --> 00:10:21,251
Bridge ain't nowhere to park a car, boy.

70
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,613
- Use some sense.
- Thanks, Ray.

71
00:10:48,696 --> 00:10:50,604
- Jesus!
- Who is it?

72
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:53,165
- It's Cece's grandmother.
- See what you've done?

73
00:10:53,237 --> 00:10:56,552
- You were on the wrong side of the road.
- Look where your car is!

74
00:10:56,627 --> 00:11:00,716
Both of you just shut up. She just moved.
Miss Emmie, are you OK?

75
00:11:00,784 --> 00:11:02,790
Eric, no!

76
00:11:02,863 --> 00:11:04,553
Ray! Help us!

77
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,344
Get out of the way.

78
00:11:09,675 --> 00:11:13,383
- I'll take hold of her and pass her off, OK?
- OK.

79
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:28,281
It's OK. I got you.

80
00:11:28,353 --> 00:11:30,261
The suitcase.

81
00:11:33,598 --> 00:11:35,484
The suitcase, please.

82
00:11:35,548 --> 00:11:38,416
You must... Oh, please...

83
00:11:39,226 --> 00:11:41,297
Please... you must...

84
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:46,833
- It's OK. It's OK.
- You must...

85
00:11:46,902 --> 00:11:48,656
You must...

86
00:11:49,332 --> 00:11:50,924
OK. It's OK.

87
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:02,310
It's gonna be OK.
It's gonna be OK.

88
00:12:02,381 --> 00:12:04,267
- What are you doing?
- Give me a second.

89
00:12:06,186 --> 00:12:09,413
- Come on, Ray. Get the hell out of the car.
- It's OK, kid.

90
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,868
Please, just stay...

91
00:12:21,122 --> 00:12:22,583
Ray!

92
00:12:22,657 --> 00:12:25,273
Ray! No!

93
00:12:27,518 --> 00:12:29,906
Ray! Ray!

94
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,474
- No!
- Eric, no!

95
00:12:40,055 --> 00:12:42,061
Fuck!

96
00:13:02,058 --> 00:13:03,845
Oh, my God.

97
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:15,388
Get me up to speed.
What's going on?

98
00:13:15,457 --> 00:13:18,772
Junior and the man got him out.

99
00:13:18,848 --> 00:13:23,318
But they can't do much
about the car until the tide drops.

100
00:13:27,259 --> 00:13:28,469
Jesus.

101
00:13:28,538 --> 00:13:31,286
Something got a hold of him good
down there.

102
00:13:31,353 --> 00:13:33,294
Messed him up real bad.

103
00:13:33,368 --> 00:13:35,984
Damn swamp's full of snakes.

104
00:13:36,054 --> 00:13:38,289
Check this out.

105
00:13:41,715 --> 00:13:43,983
They retrieved it from the car.

106
00:13:46,224 --> 00:13:48,132
What is that?

107
00:13:50,382 --> 00:13:52,552
Some kind of Veve.

108
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,008
Old-time Creole.

109
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:58,245
My granddaddy
got stories about that woman.

110
00:13:58,313 --> 00:14:00,068
Keep you up nights.

111
00:14:01,319 --> 00:14:04,383
Look here. I want this bridge secured
and this road cleared.

112
00:14:04,453 --> 00:14:07,004
Hold on, now.
My day off started two hours ago.

113
00:14:07,075 --> 00:14:11,807
- How am I supposed to tow a tow truck?
- Goddammit, boy, hop to it.

114
00:14:11,873 --> 00:14:13,595
Shit.

115
00:14:25,496 --> 00:14:27,862
It was an accident, Eric.

116
00:14:29,398 --> 00:14:31,699
They're both dead.

117
00:14:33,748 --> 00:14:38,317
I should have gone in.
I should have tried to save him.

118
00:14:38,385 --> 00:14:41,645
So what?
That you could have drowned too?

119
00:14:42,766 --> 00:14:45,220
I should have done something.

120
00:15:45,258 --> 00:15:47,145
Sheriff!

121
00:15:47,881 --> 00:15:50,432
- Was there a suitcase?
- I'm sorry, child?

122
00:15:50,503 --> 00:15:52,389
Was there a suitcase in the car?

123
00:15:52,454 --> 00:15:54,721
Yeah, there was.
We pulled it out. It was empty.

124
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:56,860
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

125
00:15:56,932 --> 00:15:58,719
Cece, are you OK?

126
00:15:58,786 --> 00:16:01,752
- What happened?
- It was an accident.

127
00:16:01,825 --> 00:16:04,158
What happened to Ray?
They said he was in the car.

128
00:16:04,223 --> 00:16:06,523
The car went in the water.

129
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,215
He drowned.

130
00:16:08,285 --> 00:16:09,942
Is that true?

131
00:16:10,012 --> 00:16:14,352
Either that or the swamp snakes got him.
We don't know for sure.

132
00:16:14,425 --> 00:16:16,082
Oh, my God.

133
00:16:16,152 --> 00:16:18,517
I need to go to my grandma's house.

134
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:21,777
- Take me to my grandma's house.
- You don't want to be there alone.

135
00:16:21,844 --> 00:16:25,770
Please, please. My dad, he's in Biloxi.
He'll be there till Sunday.

136
00:16:25,842 --> 00:16:29,484
Can you please just take me
to my grandmother's house?

137
00:16:29,552 --> 00:16:32,649
All right. I'll take you.

138
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,545
Snakes.

139
00:16:44,615 --> 00:16:46,403
I'm telling you.

140
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:51,868
I don't know, some damn swamp snakes
chewed his ass up.

141
00:16:51,939 --> 00:16:54,719
I swear to Jesus. It's a mess.

142
00:16:54,785 --> 00:17:01,012
I ain't seen nothing like this
since old man Hardy died in that mill fire.

143
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,902
Hold on a second.

144
00:17:51,584 --> 00:17:55,291
Sorry about that.
He had a death rattle.

145
00:17:56,733 --> 00:18:00,506
Well, Hank don't get in
till noon tomorrow.

146
00:18:03,417 --> 00:18:06,133
I'm sorry, honey pie.

147
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,370
Yeah, me too.

148
00:18:10,741 --> 00:18:12,682
Bye, girl.

149
00:18:12,756 --> 00:18:14,511
Bye.

150
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:24,745
Jesus Christ.

151
00:19:57,782 --> 00:20:02,187
Four years out of the academy
and he's giving me this bullshit.

152
00:20:03,699 --> 00:20:05,705
Jesus!

153
00:20:06,194 --> 00:20:07,622
Shit!

154
00:20:08,304 --> 00:20:10,986
The sheriff is gonna have my ass...

155
00:20:11,054 --> 00:20:14,369
<i> You done with that tow truck?
The sheriff's asking for you.</i>

156
00:20:14,444 --> 00:20:16,548
Not now, bitch.

157
00:20:16,619 --> 00:20:18,244
Pain in the butt.

158
00:20:40,605 --> 00:20:42,360
Hey!

159
00:20:43,548 --> 00:20:45,913
All right, now.

160
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:48,530
Who's in here?

161
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:13,989
Shit.

162
00:21:18,983 --> 00:21:21,153
All right, now.

163
00:21:23,172 --> 00:21:26,018
This is Deputy Darrell Turner.

164
00:21:30,464 --> 00:21:33,365
I want whoever's out here...

165
00:21:34,462 --> 00:21:36,916
to show themselves.

166
00:21:52,947 --> 00:21:54,735
Oh, shit!

167
00:21:58,256 --> 00:22:01,352
<i>- Give me the sheriff.
- Turner. Where you at. Boy?</i>

168
00:22:01,422 --> 00:22:04,104
Betty, just do what I say.

169
00:22:04,172 --> 00:22:06,538
Get me the sheriff right now.

170
00:22:47,028 --> 00:22:48,849
- Honey, how are you?
- I'm fine.

171
00:22:48,914 --> 00:22:52,687
How'd you sleep?
Oh, thank God you're OK.

172
00:22:52,752 --> 00:22:55,652
- What can I get you? Are you hungry?
- No. I'm OK, thank you.

173
00:22:55,726 --> 00:22:58,539
- Coffee?
- Sure.

174
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:14,079
- New York?
- Yeah.

175
00:23:14,147 --> 00:23:18,520
That sucks. Have you ever been there?
The place smells.

176
00:23:18,592 --> 00:23:21,722
I don't know what's going on with her.
She's changed.

177
00:23:21,791 --> 00:23:25,717
- It started when her dad got sick.
- Well, she needs to get over that shit.

178
00:23:38,486 --> 00:23:41,899
- About last night...
- Yeah, what?

179
00:23:43,379 --> 00:23:46,672
- I'm sorry, you know.
- Will you stop with that, please?

180
00:23:46,736 --> 00:23:49,669
Look around.
The world's a better place without that guy.

181
00:23:49,743 --> 00:23:51,368
Come on, this has got to upset you.

182
00:23:51,438 --> 00:23:54,283
No. He was nothing to me, all right?

183
00:23:54,348 --> 00:23:58,175
I mean, I didn't even speak two words
to this guy in my entire life.

184
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:02,306
He's a redneck piece of shit, he got
my mom drunk, and he left her pregnant.

185
00:24:02,375 --> 00:24:04,708
That doesn't make him my father.

186
00:24:04,774 --> 00:24:06,595
Jesus.

187
00:24:06,661 --> 00:24:08,929
You know, the guy's dead.

188
00:24:08,995 --> 00:24:11,383
When is this town
just gonna shut up about it?

189
00:27:03,198 --> 00:27:07,603
I mean, are you sure it was Ray's tow
truck? Not a pickup, an SUV, a Miata?

190
00:27:07,675 --> 00:27:09,616
There's no mistaking that truck.

191
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:14,575
I don't know what to say.
I mean, it's kind of impossible, Eden.

192
00:27:16,181 --> 00:27:19,692
Ray Sawyer was a dick.
I'm sorry. I know he's dead.

193
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:22,031
- Whatever. He's a dead dick.
- You're bad.

194
00:27:22,098 --> 00:27:23,820
It was the scar that made him mean.

195
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:26,855
No. He's had that scar
ever since he was a kid, fighting.

196
00:27:26,928 --> 00:27:29,348
- Some people are just born rotten.
- Or gay.

197
00:27:29,422 --> 00:27:31,177
- Or bitchy.
- Or bitchy.

198
00:27:32,524 --> 00:27:36,264
Come on, hooker. We got a mall
to knock over. Ricky, you coming or not?

199
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:38,303
No, I've reached my daily limit.

200
00:27:38,377 --> 00:27:42,019
Come on.
I'll drop you off at Abercrombie.

201
00:27:42,086 --> 00:27:44,899
Let's go have some fun.

202
00:27:44,965 --> 00:27:46,622
Do you know about Cece's grandma?

203
00:27:46,692 --> 00:27:52,056
I heard the same stories as you. She was
a big-time mambo priestess or something.

204
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:55,637
What were you doing at the cemetery?

205
00:27:55,711 --> 00:27:57,499
I went to see my dad.

206
00:27:58,973 --> 00:28:02,582
Look, last night was rough.
It's been a rough year.

207
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:04,472
Give yourself a break.

208
00:28:04,538 --> 00:28:07,951
- I'm crazy, huh?
- No. I'm the crazy one.

209
00:28:08,983 --> 00:28:11,731
Now, I'm off soon.
You are gonna hang out with me today.

210
00:28:11,797 --> 00:28:17,544
We're gonna go to the lake and you
are gonna forget about last night. OK?

211
00:28:33,896 --> 00:28:37,439
- You don't need air.
- It'll take two seconds.

212
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:40,508
See? It's low.

213
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:44,190
- You're taking a dead man's air.
- Air's free.

214
00:28:44,258 --> 00:28:48,150
- Yeah. I'm gonna pee.
- You're using a dead man's toilet.

215
00:28:48,224 --> 00:28:51,354
Oh, I promise to flush and be polite.

216
00:29:04,598 --> 00:29:09,102
Hey, Tammy. If you wanted somewhere
to break in and enter, now's your chance.

217
00:29:09,172 --> 00:29:13,293
- Will you hurry? We're gonna hit traffic.
- Shut up.

218
00:29:37,603 --> 00:29:39,358
Oh.

219
00:29:41,089 --> 00:29:42,779
Ugh!

220
00:29:48,221 --> 00:29:49,944
Patty.

221
00:29:51,579 --> 00:29:54,676
Patty, come on.
The mall closes at eight.

222
00:30:20,554 --> 00:30:24,130
Patty. Come on, dude.

223
00:30:29,765 --> 00:30:31,706
Hey-hey!

224
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:41,659
Patty!

225
00:30:43,932 --> 00:30:45,589
Patty?

226
00:31:01,426 --> 00:31:03,181
Patty!

227
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:17,982
Goddammit. Fuck!

228
00:31:18,057 --> 00:31:19,300
Patty!

229
00:31:19,368 --> 00:31:21,788
What the fuck?

230
00:31:39,452 --> 00:31:41,077
Patty?

231
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:01,862
Agh!

232
00:32:32,093 --> 00:32:33,880
No! No!

233
00:32:33,948 --> 00:32:35,671
No!

234
00:32:49,843 --> 00:32:52,143
Please leave me alone.

235
00:32:59,565 --> 00:33:01,222
Please.

236
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:07,045
Please!

237
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,439
No! No!

238
00:33:12,485 --> 00:33:14,524
Oh, please!

239
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:24,565
No! No, no!

240
00:33:24,638 --> 00:33:27,539
No, no, no, no!

241
00:33:27,613 --> 00:33:30,262
Please, no! Please!

242
00:33:37,303 --> 00:33:41,523
- More beer!
- You're gonna have to work for it.

243
00:33:51,598 --> 00:33:54,913
- You're drunk.
- You're drunk? You didn't have anything.

244
00:33:54,989 --> 00:33:57,126
<i>No, you're drunk.</i>

245
00:33:58,475 --> 00:34:00,742
I don't know, Eden.

246
00:34:00,809 --> 00:34:04,581
I know it doesn't make sense,
but something really weird is going on.

247
00:34:04,646 --> 00:34:09,248
You saw it yourself. When Cece found out
Ray was killed by snakes, she flipped out.

248
00:34:09,316 --> 00:34:11,519
Her grandmother just died, Eden.

249
00:34:11,587 --> 00:34:14,749
She was upset.
We're all upset.

250
00:34:14,817 --> 00:34:16,921
I think I'm gonna go check up on her.

251
00:34:16,992 --> 00:34:19,990
My mom says that Miss Emmie
lived out at the end of Fuller Road,

252
00:34:20,062 --> 00:34:21,686
and she's there all by herself.

253
00:34:21,757 --> 00:34:26,675
Hey, you know, I don't want you to get
all worked up about this voodoo shit.

254
00:34:26,746 --> 00:34:30,519
It's not real.
It's just Louisiana folklore.

255
00:34:30,584 --> 00:34:32,110
Yeah, I know.

256
00:34:32,182 --> 00:34:33,937
Hey.

257
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:36,971
Are we still fighting?

258
00:34:37,556 --> 00:34:43,532
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- I swear to God I am not making this up.

259
00:34:44,112 --> 00:34:47,143
- You guys, what's going on?
- The town is upside down.

260
00:34:47,214 --> 00:34:50,441
Deputy Turner and Terry Parker
who works at the morgue are missing.

261
00:34:50,508 --> 00:34:54,913
And here's the really fucked-up part.
So is Ray Sawyer.

262
00:34:54,986 --> 00:34:58,912
- Ray's dead, Ricky.
- Yeah. That's the really fucked-up part.

263
00:34:58,983 --> 00:35:00,923
His body's missing.

264
00:35:04,164 --> 00:35:07,196
What the fuck
are you all looking at me for?

265
00:35:08,225 --> 00:35:11,703
- Fuck this.
- Sean, where are you going? Sean! Sean!

266
00:35:12,799 --> 00:35:16,659
- I'm gonna go check on Cece.
- Eric, stop him. He's drunk.

267
00:35:22,649 --> 00:35:24,437
Sean!

268
00:35:24,504 --> 00:35:27,633
What are you doing, man?
You can't drive like this.

269
00:35:27,702 --> 00:35:30,319
He's not gonna go away.
He'll never fucking go away.

270
00:35:30,389 --> 00:35:32,395
Get off the bike and we'll talk about it.

271
00:35:32,467 --> 00:35:34,855
Oh, fuck this.

272
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:36,969
Drunk fucker.

273
00:36:13,595 --> 00:36:15,449
This is where Cece lives?

274
00:36:15,514 --> 00:36:20,018
No, her grandmother does.
Come on, I think it's this way.

275
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:37,030
Nice house.

276
00:36:50,214 --> 00:36:52,285
The mambo woman
meant business, huh?

277
00:36:52,356 --> 00:36:55,224
All this voodoo shit
weirds me out.

278
00:37:11,641 --> 00:37:13,549
Cece?

279
00:37:14,583 --> 00:37:16,786
Just go in.

280
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:20,624
- What?
- What is that?

281
00:37:20,692 --> 00:37:24,519
- I don't know.
- I don't like it.

282
00:37:32,941 --> 00:37:35,209
Cece?

283
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:44,420
I don't think she's here.

284
00:37:44,486 --> 00:37:46,656
Check this out.

285
00:37:50,882 --> 00:37:55,352
- What's it supposed to be?
- I don't know.

286
00:37:55,423 --> 00:37:58,007
It's a milking ceremony.

287
00:37:58,782 --> 00:38:01,562
It's an old Haitian ritual.

288
00:38:01,628 --> 00:38:05,880
The mambo's saving the man's soul,
cleansing him of his evil.

289
00:38:06,681 --> 00:38:08,240
It's his last rites.

290
00:38:08,312 --> 00:38:11,626
The snakes
are charmed by the mambo.

291
00:38:11,702 --> 00:38:14,003
They suck out the man's evil...

292
00:38:15,028 --> 00:38:17,394
so that his soul may pass on.

293
00:38:22,799 --> 00:38:25,220
What are you guys doing here?

294
00:38:25,294 --> 00:38:27,530
We need to talk.

295
00:38:54,109 --> 00:38:57,490
Guess
this is all mine now, huh?

296
00:38:57,564 --> 00:38:59,057
You know what I'm gonna do?

297
00:38:59,131 --> 00:39:02,740
I've been thinking about this.
I think I'm gonna repaint this place.

298
00:39:02,808 --> 00:39:04,498
Yeah, spruce it up a bit.

299
00:39:04,567 --> 00:39:07,882
Bring the business back
to the Happy Time gas station.

300
00:39:07,957 --> 00:39:11,948
What do you think, like a light blue,
maybe? A sunny yellow, perhaps?

301
00:39:12,019 --> 00:39:14,538
Something real happy, right?

302
00:39:14,609 --> 00:39:17,063
Come on, Sean.
I'll take you home.

303
00:39:17,136 --> 00:39:18,728
So how do I look?

304
00:39:18,799 --> 00:39:21,732
Do I look like
I'm gonna be a good gas pumper, huh?

305
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:26,088
'Course, I'm gonna have to get myself
a tattoo, right? And a big scar.

306
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:29,830
'Cause if I'm gonna be the new town freak,
I gotta do it all the way, correct?

307
00:39:33,159 --> 00:39:35,743
Hear that?

308
00:39:37,956 --> 00:39:39,580
So what do you think, man?

309
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:43,390
Do you think I got what it takes? Huh?
Do I got what it takes?

310
00:39:43,456 --> 00:39:46,106
Are people gonna come through here
and ring my bell?

311
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:49,522
Huh? Are they gonna ring my bell?
You think they'll come through?

312
00:39:49,597 --> 00:39:52,464
- Don't do this, man.
- Don't do what?

313
00:39:52,539 --> 00:39:56,498
Yeah, don't worry, Dad.
I'll make you real fucking proud.

314
00:39:57,752 --> 00:40:01,012
Sean! Sean, come on, man!

315
00:40:02,229 --> 00:40:04,945
Sean, stop it!

316
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:10,602
- Get the fuck off me!
- Come on.

317
00:40:28,998 --> 00:40:31,069
Oh, shit!

318
00:41:01,298 --> 00:41:04,144
This is some weird shit.

319
00:41:04,209 --> 00:41:06,379
I don't like it.

320
00:41:15,946 --> 00:41:18,912
When did Ray's body go missing?

321
00:41:18,984 --> 00:41:24,415
I don't know, but I think I saw
his truck this morning at the cemetery.

322
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:34,390
Who else is missing?

323
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:36,666
Terry who works at the morgue...

324
00:41:36,734 --> 00:41:39,602
and Deputy Turner.

325
00:41:39,676 --> 00:41:41,976
What's going on, Cece?

326
00:41:53,748 --> 00:41:56,202
It's a voodoo temple.

327
00:41:56,275 --> 00:42:00,528
Grandma was a mambo,
like her mother before her.

328
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:05,196
It's in our blood, Eden.

329
00:42:08,939 --> 00:42:13,923
For generations,
people would come here to worship.

330
00:42:13,992 --> 00:42:17,438
It's a religion, like any other.

331
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:20,857
It's full of spirits - both good and evil.

332
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:26,074
They're called loas.

333
00:42:27,681 --> 00:42:30,362
Grandma helped a lot of people here.

334
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:32,404
She was a good woman.

335
00:42:33,725 --> 00:42:36,538
Your grandmother was wearing this.

336
00:42:39,258 --> 00:42:41,678
It's a baka.

337
00:42:42,136 --> 00:42:44,688
It's a charm that protects against evil.

338
00:42:46,837 --> 00:42:49,966
What was she doing
out so late last night?

339
00:42:51,442 --> 00:42:55,979
You know over in Cypress,
where they're building that new mill?

340
00:42:56,048 --> 00:42:59,112
There's an old Creole burial ground there.

341
00:42:59,182 --> 00:43:02,409
She was afraid of what
someone might find if they started digging.

342
00:43:02,476 --> 00:43:04,614
The suitcase?

343
00:43:07,018 --> 00:43:09,285
Grandma saved souls.

344
00:43:11,271 --> 00:43:13,725
Murderers,

345
00:43:13,798 --> 00:43:16,252
sadists,

346
00:43:16,323 --> 00:43:18,559
the most vile men.

347
00:43:20,545 --> 00:43:22,715
She milked them of evil.

348
00:43:23,584 --> 00:43:25,438
What was in that suitcase, Cece?

349
00:43:25,503 --> 00:43:29,624
Every soul that she ever milked...

350
00:43:29,692 --> 00:43:31,513
was inside that suitcase.

351
00:43:32,315 --> 00:43:35,793
So if those snakes got set free
and if they killed Ray,

352
00:43:35,865 --> 00:43:40,597
the evil of countless souls
is inside of him right now...

353
00:43:41,622 --> 00:43:44,686
possessing his body.

354
00:43:44,755 --> 00:43:47,786
You're really
starting to scare me, Cece.

355
00:43:48,625 --> 00:43:52,518
You said it yourself.
You saw his truck outside the cemetery.

356
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:57,410
Now his only instinct will be to kill
and to sacrifice to the dark loas.

357
00:43:57,483 --> 00:44:00,416
Nobody's safe, Eden.

358
00:44:00,490 --> 00:44:02,278
Nobody's safe.

359
00:44:05,671 --> 00:44:08,036
Should we go now?

360
00:44:08,101 --> 00:44:12,289
She's really out of it. I mean, she's saying
some weird stuff. I think she needs help.

361
00:44:12,355 --> 00:44:15,736
- What's wrong?
- I don't know, but there's no phone here.

362
00:44:15,809 --> 00:44:19,800
- Do you have your cell?
- Like we're gonna have reception here?

363
00:44:19,871 --> 00:44:23,218
Listen. You guys need to go to my house,
get my mom and bring her here.

364
00:44:23,292 --> 00:44:25,528
Call the sheriff.
Make sure he gets here too.

365
00:44:25,596 --> 00:44:27,896
What is going on, Eden?

366
00:44:27,962 --> 00:44:30,230
I don't know, OK?
Just hurry.

367
00:44:30,297 --> 00:44:32,467
I'll stay with Cece.

368
00:44:32,535 --> 00:44:34,225
Let's go.

369
00:44:34,454 --> 00:44:36,209
Let's go.

370
00:44:46,256 --> 00:44:50,148
- I sent Rachel and Ricky for help.
- You should've gone too.

371
00:44:50,221 --> 00:44:52,456
Grandma's dead.

372
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:56,776
I'm the only descendant left.
Ray Sawyer will come here.

373
00:44:56,841 --> 00:45:01,116
He'll want me dead,
and he will kill anyone in his path.

374
00:45:01,191 --> 00:45:04,353
- You need help, Cece.
- There is no help.

375
00:45:05,892 --> 00:45:10,396
You saw Ray at the cemetery because
he needs a sacred place to worship.

376
00:45:10,465 --> 00:45:16,277
Reaping the souls of all that he kills
is his only purpose now.

377
00:45:16,798 --> 00:45:18,739
And he won't stop.

378
00:45:26,008 --> 00:45:28,821
- Did you hear that?
- What?

379
00:45:34,994 --> 00:45:36,717
It's nothing.

380
00:45:36,786 --> 00:45:39,086
Come on, come on.

381
00:45:43,725 --> 00:45:46,026
What the fuck?

382
00:45:48,426 --> 00:45:51,686
My fucking car!
I can't believe this.

383
00:45:55,943 --> 00:46:00,926
- That's what the bottom of a car looks like.
- I don't think that's funny.

384
00:46:06,304 --> 00:46:09,117
Is that Ray's truck?

385
00:46:16,027 --> 00:46:18,960
What was that?

386
00:46:20,056 --> 00:46:22,357
I don't know.

387
00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:45,984
Rachel.

388
00:46:49,543 --> 00:46:50,753
Rachel, go! Go!

389
00:46:52,965 --> 00:46:55,811
Don't go out there.
Don't go out there!

390
00:46:56,547 --> 00:46:58,618
Eden!

391
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:04,668
- What's going on?
- It's Ray! It's Ray Sawyer!

392
00:47:04,734 --> 00:47:05,781
Oh, my God.

393
00:47:05,853 --> 00:47:08,667
Run! Run! Hurry!

394
00:47:08,732 --> 00:47:11,065
Run!

395
00:47:12,921 --> 00:47:14,709
- Rachel!
- Come on!

396
00:47:14,776 --> 00:47:17,044
Hurry!

397
00:47:17,527 --> 00:47:19,053
Oh, my God!

398
00:47:20,917 --> 00:47:22,956
He's coming!
He's coming!

399
00:47:24,211 --> 00:47:26,446
Argh! Argh!

400
00:47:26,514 --> 00:47:28,422
Close the door!

401
00:47:34,828 --> 00:47:37,544
- But we have to help him.
- No! No! Don't go out there.

402
00:47:38,603 --> 00:47:41,700
Argh! Argh!

403
00:47:46,789 --> 00:47:48,828
Aaargh!

404
00:47:50,275 --> 00:47:53,023
Aaaargh! Aaaargh!

405
00:47:59,422 --> 00:48:03,576
- We have to get out of here.
- No. We have to stay here. It's safe here.

406
00:48:03,644 --> 00:48:05,618
- No, it's not safe here!
- Yes, it is!

407
00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:07,729
The house is spelled.
He can't come in.

408
00:48:07,801 --> 00:48:11,890
- Oh, God! Ricky.
- Rachel, it's gonna be OK.

409
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:20,940
What the hell is he doing?

410
00:48:41,318 --> 00:48:44,164
How... how can he be alive?

411
00:48:44,228 --> 00:48:47,641
We need a gun.
Did your grandmother have a gun?

412
00:48:47,714 --> 00:48:50,134
- It won't help.
- Where's the fucking gun?

413
00:48:50,208 --> 00:48:53,108
I don't know.
The bedroom.

414
00:48:56,189 --> 00:48:58,424
Rachel.

415
00:48:58,907 --> 00:49:00,084
We're safe here.

416
00:49:00,155 --> 00:49:02,870
You're kidding, right?
Did you see that fucking thing?

417
00:49:02,937 --> 00:49:05,237
This house has been blessed.

418
00:49:05,304 --> 00:49:08,914
- It's protected against evil.
- Fucking great.

419
00:49:08,982 --> 00:49:12,754
I'm glad your grandma hexed the house
when she should have installed a phone.

420
00:49:27,274 --> 00:49:28,997
Jesus.

421
00:49:30,249 --> 00:49:35,036
- What the fuck is going on?
- I don't know. Come on, come on.

422
00:49:44,544 --> 00:49:46,430
Holy shit.

423
00:49:47,423 --> 00:49:49,876
Oh. Eden!

424
00:49:57,657 --> 00:49:59,282
Eric, get inside!

425
00:49:59,352 --> 00:50:01,260
Sean! Run!

426
00:50:01,335 --> 00:50:03,122
Get inside, Eric!

427
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:06,057
Sean, come on!
Come on!

428
00:50:08,915 --> 00:50:11,564
- Tell me that wasn't Ray Sawyer.
- He killed Ricky.

429
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:14,893
It's OK. We're safe in here.
We're safe, right?

430
00:50:14,959 --> 00:50:17,412
The altar room will be safest.

431
00:50:17,933 --> 00:50:20,233
- That thing can't be Ray.
- It's Ray, Sean.

432
00:50:20,299 --> 00:50:22,632
Yeah, but Ray's dead.

433
00:50:22,698 --> 00:50:24,388
Sean!

434
00:50:24,617 --> 00:50:26,177
Sean!

435
00:50:26,888 --> 00:50:29,439
Sean, no!

436
00:50:32,133 --> 00:50:35,001
No! He's baiting you.
Don't go out there. Don't go!

437
00:50:43,870 --> 00:50:47,164
Sean! No! Sean!

438
00:50:48,987 --> 00:50:52,116
Get up! Come on! Come on!

439
00:50:52,185 --> 00:50:54,573
Come on!

440
00:51:03,411 --> 00:51:04,904
Eden, it's OK.

441
00:51:06,545 --> 00:51:08,486
It's OK. Eden.

442
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:11,144
You got him.

443
00:51:11,214 --> 00:51:13,351
You fucking got him.

444
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:16,899
No!

445
00:51:21,384 --> 00:51:23,172
Sean! No!

446
00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:27,742
- No!
- Sean!

447
00:51:31,330 --> 00:51:33,151
Oh, my God!

448
00:51:35,264 --> 00:51:38,012
- Sean! Sean!
Sean! Sean!

449
00:51:38,078 --> 00:51:40,411
Come on, come on.

450
00:51:47,033 --> 00:51:50,348
Oh, my God! We need
to stop the bleeding! Get something!

451
00:51:50,423 --> 00:51:52,277
Hurry up!

452
00:51:52,790 --> 00:51:55,090
Hurry up!

453
00:51:55,156 --> 00:51:57,544
Hurry up!

454
00:51:57,619 --> 00:52:00,170
It's not stopping!

455
00:52:00,753 --> 00:52:02,443
Sean! Sean! Sean!

456
00:52:02,512 --> 00:52:05,674
Help him, please!

457
00:52:05,742 --> 00:52:08,904
Please! Please!

458
00:52:09,675 --> 00:52:11,529
Fuck!

459
00:52:42,841 --> 00:52:44,978
He's just standing there.

460
00:53:04,267 --> 00:53:06,884
How do we stop that thing, Cece?

461
00:53:09,065 --> 00:53:11,485
With the baka.

462
00:53:14,598 --> 00:53:19,614
Grandma says it has power over the evil,
but without her, I don't know.

463
00:53:19,683 --> 00:53:21,950
- It's impossible.
- No.

464
00:53:22,018 --> 00:53:23,773
There has to be another way.

465
00:53:23,841 --> 00:53:28,246
You know this voodoo stuff. Can't you, like,
demilk him with a ritual or something?

466
00:53:28,318 --> 00:53:30,139
That's real mambo work.

467
00:53:30,205 --> 00:53:33,977
I only know the little things,
like dolls and spells and...

468
00:53:35,034 --> 00:53:37,967
I can't.

469
00:53:41,142 --> 00:53:42,930
He's gone again.

470
00:53:44,212 --> 00:53:46,447
He didn't go far.

471
00:53:47,506 --> 00:53:51,181
- I can make a doll.
- A doll? What would that do?

472
00:53:51,248 --> 00:53:54,661
The evil is inside Ray's body.
I can't stop that.

473
00:53:54,734 --> 00:53:58,562
But maybe I can stop his body
long enough for us to get out of here.

474
00:53:58,636 --> 00:54:01,930
- It's worth a try.
- Are you talking about a voodoo doll?

475
00:54:01,994 --> 00:54:05,920
If I had something of Ray's,
like some hair or some clothing,

476
00:54:05,992 --> 00:54:08,859
some actual part of him,
I could make a doll...

477
00:54:08,934 --> 00:54:12,761
So who's gonna go outside
and pull a lock of hair?

478
00:54:16,897 --> 00:54:19,743
- Will blood work?
- What are you talking about?

479
00:54:19,807 --> 00:54:22,805
Sean's his son.
Ray's blood is running through him.

480
00:54:22,878 --> 00:54:25,266
That would work, right?

481
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:27,314
Blood works best.

482
00:54:27,387 --> 00:54:31,443
Eden, what the fuck are you talking about?
You can't be serious.

483
00:54:34,775 --> 00:54:37,229
What do we have to do?

484
00:54:38,261 --> 00:54:40,681
Help me move his body
into the altar room.

485
00:54:40,756 --> 00:54:43,405
- What are you doing?!
- Trying to get us out of here.

486
00:54:43,474 --> 00:54:46,472
By doing what?!
Making a human voodoo doll?

487
00:54:46,544 --> 00:54:49,925
- Eden, we can't do this.
- He's dead, OK?

488
00:54:49,997 --> 00:54:52,679
- We will be too if we don't do something.
- It's wrong.

489
00:54:52,748 --> 00:54:56,194
What part of that thing
did you guys not see out there?

490
00:54:56,266 --> 00:54:58,599
I won't let you.

491
00:54:58,665 --> 00:55:01,282
If there's a chance that this can work...

492
00:55:02,311 --> 00:55:04,382
the smallest chance...

493
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:17,878
Rachel.

494
00:55:17,950 --> 00:55:20,566
Help me make him more comfortable.

495
00:55:32,629 --> 00:55:37,066
Take this oil,
rub it on the temple of his forehead.

496
00:55:37,138 --> 00:55:39,526
Sprinkle this around his hands and feet.

497
00:55:39,601 --> 00:55:43,428
- What is it?
- Kempelan. It's blessing powder.

498
00:55:47,053 --> 00:55:53,062
Go to the altar, and light all
of the green candles and three red ones.

499
00:56:01,093 --> 00:56:03,458
God help us, what are we doing?

500
00:56:05,282 --> 00:56:07,736
I don't even know anymore.

501
00:56:40,301 --> 00:56:43,463
You're not gonna
stick pins in him, are you?

502
00:56:49,575 --> 00:56:51,462
Oh.

503
00:56:53,413 --> 00:56:55,997
I won't be a part of this.

504
00:56:56,068 --> 00:56:58,554
Let's... let's go to the other room.

505
00:57:13,561 --> 00:57:15,633
Are you OK?

506
00:57:23,156 --> 00:57:25,805
Follow me and do what I do.

507
00:58:04,923 --> 00:58:06,995
What's that?

508
00:58:17,333 --> 00:58:18,739
Shit.

509
00:58:23,856 --> 00:58:25,132
Watch out!

510
00:58:44,868 --> 00:58:45,915
Come on!

511
00:58:48,322 --> 00:58:50,012
Come on! Come on!

512
00:58:54,878 --> 00:58:57,266
Cece, are you OK?

513
00:58:57,341 --> 00:58:59,128
Ow.

514
00:59:01,499 --> 00:59:03,636
Come on, Cece!

515
00:59:03,705 --> 00:59:06,573
Give me the knife! Give me the knife!
Hurry! Quick!

516
00:59:09,174 --> 00:59:12,140
- It's working!
- Do it again! Do it again!

517
00:59:15,474 --> 00:59:17,383
Cece!

518
00:59:19,248 --> 00:59:21,897
Oh, my God.

519
00:59:26,732 --> 00:59:28,040
Fuck!

520
00:59:28,107 --> 00:59:29,448
Eden!

521
00:59:30,090 --> 00:59:31,878
Cece!

522
00:59:31,945 --> 00:59:33,221
No!

523
00:59:38,565 --> 00:59:39,808
Eden!

524
00:59:40,036 --> 00:59:41,661
Eden!

525
00:59:41,795 --> 00:59:43,866
Eden!

526
00:59:43,938 --> 00:59:46,784
- Come on. Come on.
- Go, go, go, go, go!

527
00:59:53,117 --> 00:59:54,774
Is he coming?

528
00:59:57,210 --> 00:59:59,664
I don't know.

529
01:00:02,487 --> 01:00:04,274
God.

530
01:00:08,915 --> 01:00:10,824
He won't stop coming!

531
01:00:12,241 --> 01:00:14,444
- Go faster!
- Hurry!

532
01:00:24,714 --> 01:00:26,622
Faster, Eric!

533
01:00:29,863 --> 01:00:31,869
Faster! Go faster!

534
01:00:32,710 --> 01:00:34,945
Come on, go faster!

535
01:00:35,332 --> 01:00:37,087
- Shit!
- Rachel!

536
01:00:42,783 --> 01:00:44,375
Rachel!

537
01:00:46,525 --> 01:00:48,379
Do something!

538
01:00:49,499 --> 01:00:51,669
Get me down!

539
01:00:51,738 --> 01:00:52,981
Shit!

540
01:00:58,263 --> 01:01:00,050
Keep it steady!

541
01:01:02,228 --> 01:01:03,601
Rachel!

542
01:01:06,482 --> 01:01:08,171
No! No! No!

543
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:09,832
Rachel!

544
01:01:19,562 --> 01:01:21,982
Oh, my God.

545
01:01:34,177 --> 01:01:36,826
We have to go. Go!

546
01:01:49,496 --> 01:01:51,535
Oh, shit!

547
01:01:51,991 --> 01:01:54,640
She's dead. They're all dead. I can't...

548
01:01:54,709 --> 01:01:59,017
No, no, no, no! Eden, listen to me.
Listen, we have to keep moving. OK?

549
01:01:59,091 --> 01:02:03,049
We're gonna get through this. You and me
together. I'm going with you to New York.

550
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:05,355
Fuck this town.

551
01:02:07,054 --> 01:02:09,027
Shit. Come on! Go, go!

552
01:02:09,101 --> 01:02:11,009
Come on!

553
01:02:11,884 --> 01:02:13,443
Come on!

554
01:02:27,202 --> 01:02:29,143
Eden.

555
01:02:32,351 --> 01:02:34,073
Come on.

556
01:02:34,142 --> 01:02:36,051
Come on. Come on.

557
01:03:00,942 --> 01:03:03,308
Where is he?

558
01:03:03,373 --> 01:03:05,957
Where'd he go?

559
01:03:06,027 --> 01:03:08,295
OK. Come on.

560
01:03:17,956 --> 01:03:19,362
Eric!

561
01:03:21,219 --> 01:03:23,160
I'm OK.

562
01:03:33,307 --> 01:03:35,379
Run! Run!

563
01:03:44,949 --> 01:03:46,377
Eric?

564
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:55,275
Eric?

565
01:03:59,628 --> 01:04:01,351
Eric?

566
01:04:02,602 --> 01:04:04,357
Eric?

567
01:04:07,591 --> 01:04:09,532
Shit.

568
01:05:35,220 --> 01:05:37,968
Oh, no.

569
01:09:14,324 --> 01:09:16,265
Fuck you!

570
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:42,541
Keys. Keys. Fuck.

571
01:13:44,598 --> 01:13:45,808
Start.

572
01:13:45,877 --> 01:13:47,850
Start. OK.

573
01:13:47,924 --> 01:13:49,068
Yes.

574
01:13:51,570 --> 01:13:53,358
Come on. Come on!

575
01:14:18,658 --> 01:14:20,217
Come on!

576
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:22,461
Come on!

577
01:14:23,461 --> 01:14:33,461
