1
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,400
Don't you know me,
Kansas City?

2
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,720
I'm the new
Berlin Wall.

3
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,160
Try and tear me down!

4
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,960
I was born
on the other side

5
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,160
Of a town
ripped in two

6
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,560
I made it over
the Great Divide

7
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,600
Now I'm coming
for you

8
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,160
Enemies
and adversaries

9
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,240
They try
and tear me down

10
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,960
You want me, baby,
I dare you

11
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,920
Try and tear me down

12
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,240
I rose from off
of the doctor's slab

13
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,560
Like Lazarus
from the pit

14
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,000
Now everyone wants
to take a stab

15
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,280
And decorate me

16
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,680
Blood, graffiti,
and spit

17
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,240
Enemies
and adversaries

18
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,080
They try
and tear me down

19
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,760
You want me, baby,
I dare you

20
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,760
Try and tear me down.

21
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,400
On August 13,
1961,

22
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,120
a wall
was erected

23
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,000
down the middle
of the city of Berlin.

24
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,320
The world was divided
by a cold war,

25
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,720
and the Berlin Wall was the most
hated symbol of that divide.

26
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,720
Reviled, graffiti'd,
spit upon.

27
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,000
We thought the wall
would stand forever.

28
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,760
And now
that it's gone,

29
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,920
we don't know
who we are anymore.

30
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,520
Ladies and gentlemen,
Hedwig is like that wall,

31
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,360
standing before you
in a divide

32
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,520
between East
and West.

33
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,440
Slavery
and freedom.

34
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,920
Man and woman.
Top and bottom.

35
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,280
And you can try
and tear her down,

36
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,360
but before you do,

37
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,080
you must remember
one thing!

38
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,120
Ain't much
of a difference

39
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,080
Between a bridge
and a wall

40
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,480
Without me right
in the middle, babe

41
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,120
Wow!

42
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,280
You would be
nothing at all

43
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,880
Enemies
and adversaries

44
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,640
They try
and tear me down

45
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,240
You want me, baby,
I dare you

46
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,120
Try and tear
me down

47
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,120
Enemies
and adversaries

48
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,560
They try
and tear me down

49
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:14,720
You me want me, baby,
I dare you

50
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,920
Try and
tear me down.

51
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,760
From East Berlin

52
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,560
to Junction City.

53
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,920
Hello, New York;
Hello, Missouri.

54
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,720
What? You wanna try
and tear me down?

55
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,960
Come on and tear-rrr-

56
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,320
Me down!

57
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,000
Hello...?

58
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,280
Where is everybody?

59
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,480
Out.

60
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,640
"Out"? Why are you
in such a mood?

61
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:41,000
I have been having
the most wonderful time with-

62
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,080
do you remember
that 45-year-old divorcee

63
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,360
with the hair
and the mean look?

64
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,800
She came up to me
after the show, and I thought,

65
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,080
"This lady wants
a piece of me. "

66
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,560
So I didn't know
what to do.

67
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,600
I was alone,
I had nothing in my hand,

68
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,320
I was gonna go
for the eyes.

69
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,320
She came at me
from both sides, somehow,

70
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,400
and she just gave me
a fucking hug.

71
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,440
She gave me
a fucking hug.

72
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,360
Can you figure?

73
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,120
Can you fucking beat that?
She gave me-

74
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,520
I also got a few drinks
out of it as well,

75
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,720
which was not
a bad...

76
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,760
I was born
on the other side

77
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,000
Of a town
ripped in two

78
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,360
Made it over
the Great Divide

79
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,600
Now I'm coming
for you

80
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,000
Enemies
and adversaries...

81
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,520
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

82
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,240
Why can't we...

83
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,240
why don't you write
a new song?

84
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,240
You want me, baby,
I dare you

85
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,240
Try and tear me down...

86
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,080
Thank you,
my name is Hedwig.

87
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,960
Please welcome those ambassadors
of Eastern bloc rock,

88
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,240
The Angry Inch.
Here they are.

89
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,800
And my man Friday,

90
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,360
through Thursday,

91
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,000
Yitzhak, ladies
and gentlemen.

92
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,080
There's no need,
there's none.

93
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,680
Also very talented and so lucky
to be here, right, boys?

94
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,400
- Yeah.
- Yes, Miss Hedwig.

95
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,400
Look out, guys,
Immigration!

96
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,960
I've got their passports
right here.

97
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,760
Ladies and gentlemen,

98
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,760
do you like the pelt?
I want you to be honest,

99
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,840
because some bitch
stopped me on the way in-

100
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,760
"What poor, unfortunate
creature had to die

101
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,080
for you to wear that?"

102
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,160
"My Aunt Trudy,"
I replied.

103
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,520
Just walked away.
Just walked away ladies and-

104
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,000
- Hedwig, can we eat dessert?
- What is it? Yes, you can.

105
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,080
I am thrilled,

106
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,560
you can join me for
the fabulous first night

107
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,920
of the St. Louis leg
of my world tour.

108
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,040
And when it comes
to huge openings,

109
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,240
a lot of people
think of me.

110
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,240
Many more of you,
though,

111
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,520
have only recently
become aware of me.

112
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,800
It took a character
assassination piece like this

113
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,880
to make you finally
pay attention.

114
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,600
But now you're
interested, huh?

115
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,280
Intrigued, even?

116
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,240
How did some...

117
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:47,600
slip of a girly-boy
from Communist East Berlin

118
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,000
become the internationally
ignored song stylist

119
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,920
barely standing
before you?

120
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,480
That's what I want to talk about
tonight, ladies and gentlemen.

121
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,880
I don't wanna talk
about sudden,

122
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,880
undeserved
commercial success.

123
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,240
I don't wanna talk
about betrayal,

124
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,880
I don't wanna talk
about my lawsuit

125
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,400
against a certain
rock and roll "icon,"

126
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,600
Tommy Gnosis,

127
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,080
who, by some freak
coincidence, is performing

128
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,280
right next door
at Busch Stadium.

129
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,080
And to whom I taught
everything he knows,

130
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,440
and has apparently
forgotten,

131
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,280
about rock & roll!

132
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,000
Yes, this is
Phyllis Stein,

133
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,480
manager of Hedwig
and the Angry Inch.

134
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,840
I've been ho-
"Inch"! Not "Itch. "

135
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,560
Let me speak
to Brad, please.

136
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,000
You know I've been holding
for 24 minutes?

137
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,160
Yes, hi, Brad,
this is Phyllis.

138
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,240
So what's going on
with Bilgewater's?

139
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,280
You make
the baby cry.

140
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,440
I heard the entire
chain's going under.

141
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,600
Hold on,
hold on a second.

142
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,640
- Hedwig!
- We can have a gig

143
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,680
in any Bilgewater's nationwide
with a 24-hour notice?

144
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,320
And they know what kind
of music we play?

145
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,240
Brad, I love you.

146
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,000
Okay, ciao.

147
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,360
People, people,
people.

148
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,440
Tomorrow is
a travel day.

149
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,240
It's a travel day
for Tommy,

150
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,840
so it's a travel day
for us.

151
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,320
Friday, Chicago.

152
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,000
Tommy's
at Soldier Field,

153
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,360
and we're
at Bilgewater's

154
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,720
in the mall
down the street.

155
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,080
And the next day,
looks like he's...

156
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,640
basically, he's back
on the bus.

157
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,720
Phyllis-
"basically"?

158
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,240
He's doing
a record signing.

159
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,920
Why do you feel
the need to lie to me?

160
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,240
Hedwig, please.
Come.

161
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,680
I don't think it's going
to help our lawsuit

162
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,640
if you continue to-

163
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,600
if you present
the appearance of stalking.

164
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,600
You know I don't
like that word.

165
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,240
Please listen to me.
How about you don't talk to him,

166
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,960
and I get someone
to steal a photo

167
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,640
- of you two together?
- A photo-

168
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,240
You know some rag
will run it.

169
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,600
It'll really help
the lawsuit.

170
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,600
Proves you two
know each other.

171
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,120
Please,

172
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,240
let me do my job.
Please?

173
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,600
Okay.

174
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,400
I'm gonna make
some phone calls.

175
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,040
I'm gonna make
some phone calls!

176
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,880
All right.

177
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,600
Okay, everybody.
Bedski!

178
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,600
Ladies and gentlemen,

179
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,000
I recently found
my first diary.

180
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:16,120
Age 2-6.

181
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,440
EAST BERLIN 1968

182
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,880
It was fully illustrated.

183
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,240
As I unrolled the pages,

184
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,240
I realised that so many people
have touched me

185
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,160
on my way
to this stage tonight.

186
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,920
How can I say
who touched me the most?

187
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,240
My father,
the American Gl?

188
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,760
Could it have been
my East German mother?

189
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,600
...pervert!

190
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,600
Get out! Get out!

191
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,600
Go on... Go on!

192
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,960
When the earth
was still flat

193
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:19,520
And clouds
made of fire

194
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,440
And mountains
stretched up to the sky

195
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,160
Sometimes higher

196
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,080
Folks roamed the earth

197
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,840
Like big rolling kegs

198
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,680
They had
two sets of arms

199
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,080
They had
two sets of legs

200
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:42,160
They had two faces peering
out of one giant head

201
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,880
So they could watch
all around them

202
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,320
As they talked
while they read

203
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,840
And they never

204
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,600
Knew nothing of love

205
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,560
It was before

206
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:06,800
The origin of love

207
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,480
Now there was
three sexes then

208
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:13,480
One that looked like two men
glued up back-to-back

209
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,440
They called
the children of the sun

210
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,080
And similar
in shape and girth

211
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,360
Was the children
of the Earth

212
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,240
They looked like two girls
rolled up in one

213
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,680
And the children
of the moon

214
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,960
Looked like a fork
shoved on a spoon

215
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,600
They was part sun,
part earth

216
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:35,280
Part daughter, part son

217
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,840
Aah-

218
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,520
The origin of love

219
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,520
Now the gods
grew quite scared

220
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,480
Of our strength
and defiance

221
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,080
And Thor said

222
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,600
"I'm gonna kill 'em all
with my hammer

223
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,160
Like I killed
the giants"

224
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,840
ButZeus said

225
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,080
"No, you better
let me

226
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,440
Use my lightning
like scissors

227
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:06,000
Like I cut the legs
off the whales

228
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,240
Dinosaurs into lizards"

229
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,040
And then he grabbed up
some bolts

230
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,080
He let out a laugh

231
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,600
Said, "I'll split them
right down the middle

232
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,360
Gonna cut them
right up in half"

233
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:22,000
And the storm clouds
gathered above

234
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,680
Into great balls
of fire

235
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,160
And then fire

236
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,800
Shot down from the sky
in bolts

237
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:41,160
Like shining blades
of a knife

238
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,920
And they ripped
right through the flesh

239
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,440
Of the children
of the sun

240
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,760
And the moon
and the earth

241
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,080
And some Indian god

242
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,160
Sewed the wound up
into a hole

243
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,760
Pulled it round
to our bellies

244
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:59,880
To remind us
the price we pay

245
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:03,680
And Osiris,
and the gods of the Nile

246
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:08,040
Gathered up a big storm
to blow a hurricane

247
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:11,160
To scatter us away

248
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,400
In a flood
of wind and rain

249
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,680
A sea of tidal waves

250
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,280
To wash us all away

251
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,280
And if we don't behave

252
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,520
They'll cut us down again

253
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,120
And we'll be hopping around
on one foot

254
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,480
Looking through
one eye

255
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,680
The last time
I saw you

256
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,960
We'd just split
in two

257
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,120
You was looking
at me

258
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,040
I was looking
at you

259
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,360
You had a way
so familiar

260
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,000
I could not recognise

261
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,400
'Cause you had blood
on your face

262
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,600
I had blood
in my eyes

263
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,240
But I could swear
by your expression

264
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,240
That the pain
down in your soul

265
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,600
Was the same
as the one down in mine

266
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:17,600
That's the pain

267
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:21,560
That cuts a straight line
down through the heart

268
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,920
We call it love

269
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,800
We wrapped our arms
around each other

270
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,160
Tried to shove ourselves
back together

271
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,160
We was making love

272
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,800
Making love

273
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:37,840
It was a cold, dark evening
such a long time ago

274
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:41,440
When, by the mighty hand
of Jove

275
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,440
It was a sad story
how we became

276
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,560
Lonely two-legged
creatures

277
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,600
The story
of the origin of love

278
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,280
That's
the origin of love

279
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,600
Oh yeah

280
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,440
The origin of love

281
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,440
The origin of love

282
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:07,360
The origin of love.

283
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:28,320
It is clear that
I must find my other half,

284
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,440
but is it a he,
or a she?

285
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,720
What does this person
look like?

286
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,800
Identical to me?

287
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,960
Or somehow complementary?

288
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:46,760
Does my other half have
what I don't?

289
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,240
Did he get the looks?

290
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,840
The luck?

291
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,480
The love?

292
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:57,000
Were we really separated
forcibly,

293
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,800
or did he just run off
with the good stuff?

294
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,240
Or did I?

295
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:05,000
Will this person
embarrass me?

296
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,000
What about sex?

297
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,600
Is that how we put ourselves
back together again?

298
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,960
Or can two people...

299
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,840
actually become one...

300
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,000
again?

301
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,400
I remember once
when I was six years old

302
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,440
I was watching
my favourite cartoon

303
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,240
on American Forces
Network-

304
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,000
"Jesus Was Good. "

305
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,080
Jesus said the darndest thing.

306
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,160
Don't you ever mention
that name to me again.

307
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,640
But he died for our sins.

308
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,280
So did Hitler.

309
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,800
Absolute power corrupts.

310
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,360
Absolutely.

311
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,560
Better to be powerless, my son.

312
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:08,000
In the year I was born,
The Wall went up.

313
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,000
And many people decided
to move west to freedom.

314
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,600
Mother threw me
into a wheelbarrow

315
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,240
and headed east.

316
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,320
The Communists
gave her a job

317
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,080
teaching sculpture
to limbless children.

318
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,800
Most of my time
was spent

319
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,400
listening
to American Forces Radio.

320
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,120
We are freaks

321
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,800
We follow the code of freaks
We are freaks!

322
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,920
We stand back
We are freaks

323
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,040
We do what we please
and do what we choose

324
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,680
We are bad...

325
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,920
Our apartment
was so small,

326
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,800
that mother made me play
in the oven.

327
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,400
One of us,
one of us...

328
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,360
Late at night,

329
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,720
I would listen to the voices
of the American masters:

330
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,600
Toni Tenille,
Debby Boone,

331
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:18,600
Anne Murray-
who was actually a Canadian,

332
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,600
working in
the American idiom.

333
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,880
And then there were
the crypto-homo rockers:

334
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,880
Lou Reed, Iggy Pop,

335
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,560
David Bowie-
who was actually an idiom

336
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,880
working in America
and Canada.

337
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,560
These artists,

338
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,240
they left as deep
an impression on me

339
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:44,160
as that oven rack
did on my face.

340
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,520
To be a young American
in muskrat love,

341
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,240
soft as an easy chair,
not even the chair,

342
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:53,160
"I am," I said,
"Have I never been mellow?"

343
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,920
And the coloured girls sing...

344
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:01,920
Do, do-do, do-do,
do, do-do

345
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,360
Do, do-do, do-do

346
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:08,360
Do, do-do, do,
do-do, do-do...

347
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,360
But never
with the melody.

348
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:18,160
How could I do it better
than Toni or Lou?

349
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,840
"Hey, boy...

350
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,840
take a walk
on the wild side!"

351
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,360
By my side

352
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:40,080
You will be the one

353
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:43,680
Lying by my side

354
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:48,320
Lying by my side

355
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:54,600
Lying by my side.

356
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,400
Okay.

357
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,600
Okay.

358
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,560
One day,
in the late mid-80s...

359
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,560
I was in my
early late 20s,

360
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,280
I had just been dismissed
from university

361
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,520
after delivering
a brilliant lecture

362
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,360
on the aggressive influence
of German philosophy

363
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,520
on rock and roll,
entitled,

364
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,720
"You, Kant, Always
Get What You Want. "

365
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:50,480
At 26, my academic career
was over,

366
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,440
I had never
kissed a boy,

367
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,440
and I was
still sleeping with Mom.

368
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,960
The search
for my other half

369
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,920
on my side of The Wall

370
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,080
had proved futile.

371
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,080
Might he be found
on the other?

372
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:11,600
But how to get over?
People died trying.

373
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:17,000
Such were the thoughts
flooding my tiny head,

374
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:21,480
on the day that
I was sunning myself...

375
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,920
in an old bomb crater

376
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,240
I had discovered
near The Wall.

377
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,680
I am naked,

378
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:32,400
face down on a piece
of broken church,

379
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,960
inhaling a fragrant
westerly breeze,

380
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,520
my God, I deserved
a break today.

381
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,280
Girl,

382
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,000
I sure don't mean
to annoy you.

383
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,160
My name is
Sergeant Luther Robinson.

384
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,000
My name is Hansel.

385
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,240
Luther is silent for a moment
as he stares at my...

386
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,280
"little bishop
in a turtleneck. "

387
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,240
Hansel?

388
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:20,520
Well, you must
like candy.

389
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,800
I like Gummi Baerchen.

390
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:36,000
The taste is completely
different from a Gummi Bear,

391
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,800
yet somehow familiar.

392
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,800
It's much sweeter
than a Gummi Bear.

393
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,080
Wow.

394
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,960
And softer, too.

395
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,960
I feel
so optimistic.

396
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:50,760
I suddenly recognised
the flavour in my mouth-

397
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,240
it's the taste
of power.

398
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,320
Damn, Hansel.

399
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:59,320
I can't believe
you're not a girl.

400
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,400
You're so fine.

401
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,560
Why don't you take
the whole bag?

402
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:11,880
He searches my face
for news of his fate.

403
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:18,840
His expression is echoed
in scores of tiny faces,

404
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,360
pressing against
clear plastic,

405
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,840
panting faces of every
imaginable colour,

406
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:28,240
creed,
and non-Aryan origin,

407
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,240
fogging up the bag

408
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,760
like the windows
of a Polish bathhouse.

409
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,640
I stumbled naked
through the ruins,

410
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,440
back towards blander,
less complicated confections,

411
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,560
leaving in my wake,
a trail of rainbow carnage.

412
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:48,560
Next day, Hansel follows
the trail back,

413
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,880
and on his way
finds a Milky Way,

414
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,480
a roll of Necco Wafers,

415
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,520
some Pop Rocks,

416
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:00,400
and a giant-sized Sugar Daddy
named Luther.

417
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,520
I've got
a sweet tooth

418
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,760
For licorice drops
and jelly rolls

419
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,040
Hey, sugar daddy

420
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,240
Hansel needs some sugar
in his bowl

421
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,960
I'll lay out fine china
on the linen

422
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,600
And polish up
the chrome

423
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,720
If you've got
some sugar for me

424
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,640
Sugar daddy,
bring it home

425
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:35,480
Oh, the thrill
of control

426
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:39,840
Like the rush
of rock and roll

427
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:43,440
It's the sweetest taste
I've known

428
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,000
If you've got some sugar,
bring it home.

429
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,000
Looks like we've got

430
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,000
some sugar daddies
in the house.

431
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,240
Honey bees
go shopping

432
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,320
It's something
to be seen.

433
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,480
You could give me
a cavity, honey.

434
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:08,240
They swarm
to wildflowers

435
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,280
Get nectar
for the queen.

436
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:13,000
I bet you could fill
that cavity, sweetie.

437
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,640
And everything
you bring me

438
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,480
Got me dripping
like a honeycomb

439
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,440
If you got
some sugar for me

440
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:23,560
Sugar daddy,
bring it home.

441
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,080
It's a car wash,
ladies and gentlemen.

442
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:29,760
Whoa, the thrill
of control

443
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:33,160
Like a blitzkrieg
on the roll

444
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,800
It's the sweetest taste
I've known

445
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,400
Oh yeah

446
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,880
If you've got some sugar,
bring it home

447
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,680
Ba-da ba-da do

448
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,360
Come on, sugar daddy,
bring it home.

449
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,080
He loves me, Mother.

450
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,800
He wants to marry me...

451
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,520
and get me the hell
out of here.

452
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,920
Get my passport
and my camera, Hansel.

453
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,880
It's a simple
cut-and-paste job.

454
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,840
We change
the photo,

455
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:24,240
and you can use my name-
Hedwig Schmidt.

456
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,000
Not so simple,
ladies.

457
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,320
Baby...

458
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,840
you know
I love you.

459
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:35,080
I'm always
thinking of you.

460
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,240
But I gotta
marry you here,

461
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,000
in East Berlin.

462
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,800
And that means a full
physical examination.

463
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,120
They'd see right away
that I have a-

464
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,800
No, baby.

465
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,360
To walk away...

466
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,360
you gotta...

467
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:57,680
leave something
behind.

468
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,840
Am I right,
Mrs Schmidt?

469
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,880
I've always thought so,
Luther.

470
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,440
To be free,

471
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,600
one must give up
a little part of oneself.

472
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,960
And I know just
the doctor to take it.

473
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,000
My sex change operation
got botched

474
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:34,600
My guardian angel
fell asleep on the watch

475
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:38,280
Now all I've got
is a Barbie doll crotch

476
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,680
I've got an angry inch

477
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:43,320
Six inches forward,
five inches back

478
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,600
I got a-
I got an angry inch

479
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,640
Six inches forward
and five inches back

480
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:52,400
I got a-
I got an angry inch

481
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:56,560
I'm from the land where you
still hear the cries

482
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,800
I had to get out,
had to sever all ties

483
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,360
I changed my name
and assumed a disguise

484
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:05,400
I got an angry inch

485
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:08,360
Six inches forward,
five inches back

486
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,800
I got a-
I got an angry inch

487
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,520
Six inches forward,
five inches back

488
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,920
I got a-
I got an angry inch

489
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,760
Six inches forward,
five inches back

490
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,920
The train is coming
and I'm tied to the track

491
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,640
I try to get up,
I can't get no slack

492
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,640
I got an angry inch,
angry inch

493
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,360
My mother made my tits
out of clay

494
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,920
Tits out of clay

495
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,880
My boyfriend told me
that he'd take me away

496
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,320
Tits of clay

497
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,160
He dragged me
to the doctor one day

498
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,520
I've got an angry inch

499
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,480
Six inches forward,
five inches back

500
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:48,680
I got a motherfucking
angry inch

501
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:52,000
Six inches forward,
five inches back

502
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,600
I got a-
I got an angry inch

503
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,600
Long story short.

504
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,760
Yeah, long story short-

505
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,520
when I woke up
from the operation,

506
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,360
I was bleeding
down there.

507
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,720
I was bleeding from the gash
between my legs.

508
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,600
It's my first day
as a woman,

509
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,240
already it's that time
of the month.

510
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,800
But two days later,
the hole closed up.

511
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,120
The wound healed
and I was left...

512
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,440
With a one-inch
mound of flesh

513
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,120
Where my penis used to be,
where my vagina never was

514
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,000
It was a one-inch
mound of flesh

515
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:26,560
With a scar running down it
like a sideways grimace

516
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,680
On an eyeless face

517
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,680
- It was just a little bulge.
- Faggot!

518
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,840
It was an angry inch

519
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:36,000
Six inches forward,
five inches back

520
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,800
The train is coming
and I'm tied to the track

521
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,000
I try to get up,
I can't get no slack

522
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,920
I got an angry inch,
angry-

523
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,600
Six inches forward,
five inches back

524
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:52,000
Stay undercover till
the night turns to black

525
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,400
I got my inch,
I'm set to attack

526
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,520
I got an angry inch,
angry inch

527
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:01,000
Six inches forward,
five inches back

528
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:04,040
Stay undercover till
the night turns to black

529
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,960
I got my inch,
I'm set to attack

530
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,600
I got an angry inch,
angry inch

531
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:13,400
Six inches forward
and five inches back

532
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:16,600
The train is coming
and I'm tied to the track

533
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:19,360
I try to get up,
I can't get no slack

534
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:23,080
I got an angry inch,
angry inch

535
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,880
Six inches forward
and five inches back...

536
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:03,120
...champagne
flowing freely...

537
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,440
...all border crossings

538
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:13,000
are reported to be wide open,
and thousands are flooding

539
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,000
into the western half
of the city

540
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,720
to celebrate
their newfound freedom.

541
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,080
The Berlin Wall
has fallen,

542
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:23,000
and the world
will never be the same.

543
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:26,120
The Germans
are a patient people,

544
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:30,000
and good things come
to those who wait.

545
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,040
On nights

546
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,000
Like this

547
00:36:54,680 --> 00:37:00,760
When the world's
a bit amiss

548
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:07,080
And the lights go down
across the trailer park

549
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,680
I get down

550
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,920
I feel had

551
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:20,880
Feel on the verge
of going mad

552
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:25,240
Then it's time
to punch the clock

553
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,760
I put on some makeup

554
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,720
Turn on the tape deck

555
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,880
And put the wig
back on my head

556
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:46,000
Suddenly I'm Miss Midwest
Midnight checkout queen

557
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,240
Until I head home

558
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:51,600
And I put myself
to bed

559
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,480
I look back
on where I'm from

560
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:06,240
Look at the woman
I've become

561
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:11,640
And the strangest things
seem suddenly routine

562
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:16,000
I look up from my vermouth
on the rocks

563
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,800
A gift-wrapped wig
still in the box

564
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:24,480
Of towering Velveteen

565
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:28,120
I put on some makeup

566
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:31,440
Some Lavern Baker

567
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:35,760
I'm pulling the wig
down from the shelf

568
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:44,600
Suddenly I'm
Miss Beehive 1963

569
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:49,800
Until I wake up
and I turn back to myself

570
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:00,360
Some girls
they got natural ease

571
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:05,120
They wear it
any way they please

572
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,560
With their
French flip curls

573
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:10,320
And perfumed
magazines

574
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,400
Wear it up

575
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,880
Let it down

576
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:19,520
This is the best way
that I've found

577
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:23,000
To be the best
you've ever seen

578
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:25,400
I put on
some makeup

579
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,120
Turn on
the eight-track

580
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:34,240
I'm pulling the wig
down from the shelf

581
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:42,920
Suddenly I'm
Miss Farrah Fawcett from TV

582
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,400
Until I wake up

583
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:48,760
And I turn back
to myself

584
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Shag, bi-level, bob,
Dorothy Hamill do

585
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,720
Sausage curls,
chicken wings

586
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,320
It's all because
of you

587
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,960
With your blow-dried
feather back

588
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,680
Toni Home Wave, too

589
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,080
Flip, 'fro,
frizz, flop

590
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:07,000
It's all because
of you

591
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,880
Okay, everybody!

592
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,800
Suddenly I'm
this punk rock star

593
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,080
Of stage and screen

594
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,880
And I ain't never

595
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,800
I'm never turning back

596
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:13,400
Do-do-do
do-do do-do

597
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:16,120
Do-do-do-do.

598
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,000
When the Earth
was still flat

599
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:36,800
And clouds
made of fire

600
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,000
The mountains
stretched

601
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:42,920
Up to the sky,
sometimes higher...

602
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,640
I am so sorry.

603
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,840
I was waiting
for the phone company.

604
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,120
God, is that
his new single?

605
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,040
Don't do it, sweetie!

606
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,960
Please don't say
anything to him today.

607
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,520
If you do,
he's got the power,

608
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,360
know what I mean?
He's got the power!

609
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,800
All we need
is a snapshot,

610
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,840
then they'll know
that you were responsible

611
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:11,280
for some of the biggest
hits of the millennium,

612
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,240
and you will be
so fucking rich!

613
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,760
Damn it, looks like
the photographer's already inside.

614
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,600
Everybody,
stay right here.

615
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:22,400
Hedwig, Hedwig,
Hedwig...

616
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:25,240
please don't
say anything.

617
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,000
Let me handle it.

618
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:38,240
- Phyllis Stein party.
- Who are you with?

619
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:40,520
We're A&R from A&M.

620
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,400
Actually, this is
a private event.

621
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,800
I'm sorry.

622
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,680
- Private event?
- Mm-hmm.

623
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,000
As in, "You're not
on the list. "

624
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,160
As in,
"Find it. "

625
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:51,240
I'm looking,
and you know what?

626
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,600
It's not here.

627
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,800
- Justin!
- Get out of my fucking way!

628
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,840
Settle down.

629
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:59,600
- I could have your job!
- I don't think you could.

630
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,600
- Bitches!
- Where's my fucking brooch?

631
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:04,600
We're going to continue
to shadow Tommy's tour.

632
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,400
We're going to squeeze
the local press.

633
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,240
I do not want
to blow our wad

634
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:10,920
on my E! channel contact
until we get to New York.

635
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,400
It's all about
New York.

636
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,960
Honey, I've thought
about it,

637
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,000
I think it's a bad idea,
this photo-op.

638
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:20,760
It was your idea.

639
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:23,240
I'm second-guessing
myself now. I think...

640
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:24,440
I don't think
you should have

641
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:26,320
any personal contact
with Tommy.

642
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,760
- I guess we disagree.
- Honey, we do disagree,

643
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,440
- but please listen.
- Did you-

644
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:33,000
excuse me, did you put
a bra in a dryer?

645
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,000
What?

646
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:40,240
Did you put a bra
in a dryer?!

647
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,640
Yes.

648
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,640
How many times
do I have to tell you?

649
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:47,760
You don't put a bra
in a dryer!

650
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:49,400
It warps!

651
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:51,640
Hedwig, please,
it's a bra.

652
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:54,800
You can have
one of mine. Please!

653
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:36,000
You know,
ladies and gentlemen,

654
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,840
the road is my home.

655
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,240
- My home, the road.
- Hear, hear.

656
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,240
And when I think
about all the people

657
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,240
I have come upon
in my travels,

658
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,000
I have to think
about the people

659
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:49,240
who have come
upon me.

660
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:52,080
Tommy, can you
hear me?

661
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,440
Yeah!

662
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,760
From this milkless tit,

663
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:58,240
you sucked

664
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:02,160
the very business
we call show!

665
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:10,840
Okay.

666
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:12,400
You wanna know
about Tommy Gnosis?

667
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,280
Yeah!

668
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:16,600
Okay, I'll tell you
about Tommy Gnosis.

669
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:19,760
After my divorce,
I scraped by

670
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:23,480
with babysitting gigs
and odd jobs-

671
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:25,920
mostly the jobs
we call "blow. "

672
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:29,720
I had lost my job
at the base PX,

673
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:31,680
and I had lost
my gag reflex.

674
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,520
You do the math.

675
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:38,920
I sat for the baby
of General Speck.

676
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,040
He was the commander
of the nearby army fort,

677
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:44,600
and his other son was...

678
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:48,600
the artist formerly known
as my buttboy.

679
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:52,080
We're talking about
Tommy Speck at this time.

680
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:55,320
Tommy Speck
was a 17-year-old

681
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:58,840
classic rock-loving,

682
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:02,320
"Dungeons and Dragons"
obsessed,

683
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,600
Jesus freak

684
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:09,600
with a fish on his truck.

685
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:15,440
I found him
incredibly...

686
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:19,760
hot.

687
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:21,160
I had recently
returned

688
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:22,800
to my first love
of music.

689
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,160
I had tried singing once,
back in Berlin.

690
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:27,040
They threw tomatoes
after the show...

691
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:29,400
I had a nice salad.

692
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,120
But newly motivated,

693
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:35,400
I got myself
a cheap electric piano

694
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:39,000
and I found a couple
of Korean sergeants' wives

695
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:41,280
who churned out
a mean rhythm section.

696
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:45,120
Denial!

697
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:55,080
Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen,

698
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:57,800
thank you...
both of you.

699
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:01,240
That song was
by Mr Kurt Cobain,

700
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:02,920
now that kid's
got a future, huh?

701
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,800
How about Kwahng Yi on guitar,
ladies and gentlemen!

702
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:07,600
Give it up!

703
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,960
Kwahng Yi!

704
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:12,040
Give it up, Kwahng.

705
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:17,240
You know, I'd like
to take it down a little.

706
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,600
What do you say,
girls?

707
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:26,560
This is actually the first song
I've ever written.

708
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:30,320
And, it's written
for a guy to sing.

709
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:33,880
I know a lot of you guys
out there tonight,

710
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:35,600
a lot better
than some of you

711
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:38,240
would care to admit.

712
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:40,240
And I know
that a few of you

713
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:43,520
kick some
karaoke ass.

714
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:44,880
So...

715
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:51,240
if you're looking
for your big, breakout single,

716
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:54,400
you might wanna put a bid
on this one tonight,

717
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,800
ladies and gentlemen,
because we are talking

718
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:00,800
to Phil Collins'
people, right?

719
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:07,120
But then again,
aren't we all?

720
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:13,240
You know the sun
is in your eyes

721
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:20,840
And hurricanes
and rain

722
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:25,160
And black
and cloudy skies

723
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:31,480
You're running
up and down that hill

724
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:36,240
You turn it on
and off at will

725
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:38,240
There's nothing here

726
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:42,240
To thrill
or bring you down

727
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:50,120
And if you've got
no other choice

728
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:54,800
You know you can
follow my voice

729
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:57,920
Through the dark turns
and noise

730
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,360
Of this wicked
little town

731
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:05,240
Ah-hh...

732
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:10,880
Ah-hh...

733
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:27,040
The fates
are vicious

734
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:29,680
And they're cruel

735
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:37,280
You learned too late,
you've used

736
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:41,040
Two wishes
like a fool

737
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:48,000
And then you're someone
you are not

738
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:52,440
And Junction City
ain't the spot

739
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:59,320
Remember Mrs Lot
when she turned around

740
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:06,720
And if you've got
no other choice

741
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:11,440
You know you can
follow my voice

742
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:14,400
Through the dark turns
and noise

743
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:18,000
Of this wicked
little town.

744
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:47,520
Your show...

745
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:49,920
that song...

746
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,240
My dad gave me
this guitar to apologise

747
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:55,640
for being such
a pathetic little dictator.

748
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,720
- He sang me songs-
- Classics.

749
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:02,240
The bands
were new to me-

750
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,000
Boston, Kansas,

751
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:06,880
America, Europe, Asia.

752
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,280
Travel
exhausts me.

753
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:16,680
Where are you from,
Hedwig?

754
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:38,000
I told him my story.

755
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:40,400
I'm from
East Berlin.

756
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,720
Have you...

757
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:07,960
have you accepted
Jesus Christ

758
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:10,400
as your personal lord
and savior?

759
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:14,000
No, but I...

760
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:17,440
I love his work.

761
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:22,240
No. What he was
saving us from

762
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:24,600
was his fucking father.

763
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:28,240
What kind of god

764
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:31,400
creates Adam in his image

765
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:35,240
and then pulls Eve out of him
to keep him company?

766
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:38,400
And then tells them
not to eat

767
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,720
from the Tree
of Knowledge?

768
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,560
He was
so micromanaging.

769
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:47,000
So was Adam.

770
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:48,600
But Eve...

771
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:52,400
Eve just wanted
to know shit.

772
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:57,400
She took a bite
of the apple,

773
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:59,120
and she found out
what was good

774
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:00,600
and what was evil.

775
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:03,360
Then she gave it
to Adam,

776
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,400
so he would know,

777
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:07,760
because they were
in love.

778
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:11,760
And that was good,
they now knew.

779
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:19,400
Hedwig...

780
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:22,400
would you give me
the apple?

781
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:28,880
The words falling
from those lips.

782
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:30,800
And his eyes...

783
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:34,480
his irises
were clear cylinders

784
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:36,600
of surprising depth...

785
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:38,960
and emptiness.

786
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:41,480
Only a few puddles
of bluish pain

787
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:43,720
sloshed around inside.

788
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:46,520
Same blue
as my eyes.

789
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:52,520
At the time,

790
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:54,040
Tommy's performance options
were limited

791
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:55,640
to the occasional
guitar mass.

792
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:01,240
I initiated a six-month
curriculum of rock history...

793
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:04,280
Iyrics...

794
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:06,120
grooming...

795
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:07,960
and vocal training.

796
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:09,640
Do, do-do,
do-do...

797
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:12,080
For his graduation present,
I gave him his name:

798
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:13,560
Tommy Gnosis,

799
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:16,000
the Greek word
for knowledge.

800
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:19,360
We collaborated.

801
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:22,040
Songs exploded
out of us.

802
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:24,040
Teenage girls
started showing up.

803
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:32,400
In three months,
we were outgrossing

804
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:35,160
monster trucks
in Wichita.

805
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:37,320
With that kind of money
coming in,

806
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:40,360
I was able to devote myself
entirely to our career.

807
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:41,720
We were very happy.

808
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:47,400
Honey,
what is wrong?

809
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:49,160
My dad.

810
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:51,000
Fucking parents!

811
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:55,680
You're gonna blow
my house down.

812
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:57,120
Honey, come here.

813
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:09,920
Just let it go,
sweetie.

814
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,960
Let it go.

815
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:15,640
It's gone.

816
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:18,480
I feel it,
it's gone.

817
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,600
I'm very much aware
that we haven't kissed

818
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:40,080
in all the months
we've been together.

819
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:43,960
In fact, he's maintained
a near perfect ignorance

820
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:45,280
of the front of me.

821
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:48,400
Honey, sweetie,
you're choking me.

822
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:51,480
Sweetie, let go.
Take it easy.

823
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:53,680
You wanna work
on that new song?

824
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:56,840
Hmm? The hit?

825
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:59,720
While I finish trimming
your eyebrows?

826
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:01,880
Are you drunk?

827
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:05,600
I'm not drunk.

828
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:07,480
I'm enjoying
a little...

829
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:13,160
a little rainwater
and Everclear.

830
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:19,560
Look what
you've done...

831
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:21,040
Shit!

832
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:25,680
And I...

833
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:29,680
Will always
love you...

834
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:32,760
What do you think?

835
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:34,280
You think love
lasts forever?

836
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:36,760
No, but
this song does.

837
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:39,800
Don't knock
a multi-platinum single.

838
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:41,840
When you are suddenly
Mr Commercial?

839
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:43,400
I wish I could hit
those notes.

840
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:46,600
She's been singing this song
on a loop for three days.

841
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:54,680
Seriously,
Tom, yeah.

842
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:58,880
I believe love
is immortal.

843
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,240
Look what
you've done...

844
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:05,520
Fuck!

845
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:07,680
I can't hear
myself.

846
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:12,240
How is it
immortal?

847
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:17,400
I don't know,
perhaps because...

848
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:20,000
love creates
something that...

849
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:24,520
was not there
before.

850
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:30,800
What?

851
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:33,160
Like procreation?

852
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:35,160
Yeah,
but not only.

853
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:38,400
What?

854
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:40,280
Like recreation.

855
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:42,040
What is that?
Stop, you come in here crying

856
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:44,520
and you wanna
recreate with me.

857
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:49,080
Maybe just...

858
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:52,080
creation.

859
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:55,800
Don't move.

860
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:26,040
Look what
you've done.

861
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:33,800
And I...

862
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:38,560
Will always
love you

863
00:59:38,640 --> 01:00:08,360
I will always
love you

864
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:12,240
I will always...

865
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:13,880
Breathe through
my mouth.

866
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:18,440
Love you.

867
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:58,560
Oh, God.

868
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:00,440
Oh, Hedwig...

869
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:02,520
When Eve was still
inside Adam,

870
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:04,920
- they were in paradise.
- That's right, honey.

871
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,520
When she was
separated from him,

872
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:09,120
that's when paradise
was lost.

873
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:11,480
So when she enters
him again,

874
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:13,480
paradise will be
regained.

875
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:16,720
However you want it, honey.
Just kiss me while we do it.

876
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:40,760
What is that?

877
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:51,280
It's what I have
to work with.

878
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:02,840
M- my mum's probably
wondering where I am-

879
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:05,040
You're such
a fucking sissy.

880
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:06,880
You are such
a sissy!

881
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:09,400
What are you
afraid of, huh?

882
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:10,640
What are you
afraid of?

883
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:12,000
What!?

884
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:13,720
I love you,
I love you!

885
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:15,800
Then love
the front of me, honey!

886
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:17,240
Love the-

887
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:39,600
We are dry,
we're spent-

888
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:41,760
we're flat broke.

889
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,560
- Who ordered the pizza?
- Oh, pizza. Hallelujah.

890
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:48,400
Schlatko, what are you
talking about?

891
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:50,800
We can't afford a pizza-
this is Manhattan! We can barely-

892
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:52,800
come on in- we can barely
afford this hole.

893
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:54,560
We had to cancel
the gig tonight

894
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:56,600
because we can't
fix the amps.

895
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:59,360
No, I don't have any more money.
Schlatko, please!

896
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:04,080
I got it.

897
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:06,120
Yes you did,
and it's stunning-

898
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:07,880
Fuck off,
Phyllis.

899
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:09,520
I got the part.

900
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:10,960
I'm playing
the role of "Angel"

901
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:12,640
in Broadway Cruise's
Polynesian tour of "Rent,"

902
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:14,480
so fuck you too,
Miss Hedwig!

903
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:16,720
I'm going to be a star.
Big star.

904
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:19,120
There's nothing
you can do about it!

905
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:24,640
Yeah, okay...
I don't care.

906
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:27,640
I don't care
if you have my passport.

907
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:29,720
Fuck you,
I'm going to Guam!

908
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:32,400
And I want
a divorce.

909
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:34,560
I want a divorce
from you.

910
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:37,800
Mental cruelty,
irreconcilable difference!

911
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:02,240
I'm exhausted.

912
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:06,680
Are you tired?

913
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:14,040
You look tired.

914
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:25,320
I think maybe
we are just...

915
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:28,760
both very tired.

916
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:00,560
Hedwig...!

917
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:06,360
I don't think
you need my help anymore.

918
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:34,280
THREE WEEKS LATER

919
01:07:09,080 --> 01:07:14,120
Fire shot down
from the sky in bolts

920
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:17,600
Like shining blades
of a knife

921
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:21,360
And it ripped
right through the flesh

922
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:23,240
Of the children

923
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:26,680
Of the sun and the moon
and the earth

924
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:28,560
And some Indian god

925
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:30,760
Sewed the wound up
into a hole

926
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:32,080
Pulled it round
to our bellies

927
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:36,240
To remind us
of the price we pay

928
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:39,160
And Osiris...

929
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:42,160
Wait, did you sing
"the Cyrus"?

930
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:44,840
No, no-

931
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:46,920
You just sang "the Cyrus"
on that recording.

932
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,440
The Cyrus, Cyrus.
Cyrus the god.

933
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:52,800
There's no god
called "Cyrus. "

934
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:55,000
It's "Osiris,"
it's an Egyptian god.

935
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:57,800
- We read that book-
- We had two versions of that song.

936
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:00,080
- We had one version-
- No, we had two versions-

937
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:01,520
- and you
fucked it up!

938
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:15,280
I know.

939
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:35,280
Maybe... maybe
we could jam sometime?

940
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:43,960
Maybe we could.

941
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:51,600
...Was the same
as the one down in mine

942
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:54,480
That's the pain

943
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:58,840
Cuts a straight line
down through the heart

944
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:01,160
We called it love

945
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:03,080
So we wrapped our arms
around each other

946
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:04,480
Trying to shove-

947
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:12,560
Tommy, what's
your relationship

948
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:13,960
to Hedwig Robinson?

949
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:15,640
I never knew that woman
before that night,

950
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:17,400
and I never knew
she wasn't a woman.

951
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:26,400
Doll!

952
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:28,080
Thank you so much.

953
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:29,560
Hedwig and
the Angry Inch!

954
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:32,240
I was born

955
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:35,760
On the other side

956
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:45,320
Of a town
ripped in two

957
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:52,920
And no matter
how hard I try

958
01:10:54,960 --> 01:11:01,240
I end up
black and blue

959
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:05,440
I rose from off
of the doctor's slab

960
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:14,160
I lost a piece
of my heart

961
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:20,240
Now everyone
gets to take a stab

962
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:28,040
They cut me up
into parts

963
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:33,160
I gave a piece
to my mother

964
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:42,320
I gave a piece
to my man

965
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:49,760
I gave a piece
to the rock star

966
01:11:55,480 --> 01:11:57,720
He took
the good stuff...

967
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:05,160
And ran

968
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:08,800
I've got it
all sewn up

969
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:12,120
A hardened razor cut,
scar map across my body

970
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:15,840
And you can
trace the lines

971
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:18,400
Through misery's designs
that map across my body

972
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:20,040
A collage

973
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:23,000
I'm all sewn up

974
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:26,280
A montage

975
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:29,240
I'm all sewn up

976
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:34,440
A random pattern
with a needle and thread

977
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:37,400
The overlapping way
diseases are spread

978
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:41,040
To a tornado body
with a hand grenade head

979
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:45,760
And the legs
are two lovers entwined

980
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:48,480
Inside I'm hollowed out
outside's a paper shroud

981
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:51,520
And all the rest's
illusion

982
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:53,320
That there's
a will and soul

983
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:56,600
That we can wrest control
from chaos and confusion

984
01:12:56,680 --> 01:12:58,240
A collage

985
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:01,600
I'm all sewn up

986
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:04,520
A montage

987
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:07,400
I'm all sewn up.

988
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:12,960
Wow!

989
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:37,840
Just a boy...

990
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:43,160
No cosmic lover...

991
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:47,040
This wicked town...

992
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:51,360
Something beautiful
and new...

993
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:59,360
Forgive me
for I did not know

994
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:07,720
'Cause I was
just a boy

995
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:10,800
You were
so much more

996
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:17,800
Than any god
could ever plan

997
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:22,280
More than a woman
or a man

998
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:25,600
Now I understand

999
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:29,120
How much I took
from you

1000
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:36,240
That when everything
starts breaking down

1001
01:14:36,280 --> 01:14:40,400
You take the pieces
off the ground

1002
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:43,520
Show this wicked town

1003
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:47,840
Something beautiful
and new

1004
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:54,120
You think that luck
has left you there

1005
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:02,080
But maybe
there's nothing

1006
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:06,040
Up in the sky
but air

1007
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:11,840
And there's
no mystical design

1008
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:16,760
No cosmic lover
preassigned

1009
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:19,960
There's nothing
you can find

1010
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:23,160
That cannot
be found

1011
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:30,520
'Cause with all the changes
you've been through

1012
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:34,960
It seems the stranger's
always you

1013
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:41,640
Alone again in some new
wicked little town

1014
01:15:42,800 --> 01:16:00,600
Ah-hh

1015
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:06,160
And when you've got
no other choice

1016
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:10,720
You know you can
follow my voice

1017
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:13,800
Through the dark turns
and noise

1018
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:17,560
Of this wicked
little town

1019
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:20,400
It's a wicked

1020
01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:24,720
Little town

1021
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:29,800
Goodbye, wicked...

1022
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:36,160
Little town.

1023
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:08,920
Rain falls hard

1024
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:13,720
Burns dry

1025
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:18,520
A dream
or a song

1026
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,440
That hits you
so hard

1027
01:18:25,680 --> 01:18:28,000
Filling you up

1028
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:32,760
Suddenly gone

1029
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:38,880
Breathe

1030
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:41,560
Feel

1031
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:44,120
Love

1032
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:46,160
Give

1033
01:18:46,240 --> 01:18:48,480
Free

1034
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:52,080
Know in your soul

1035
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:57,080
Like your blood
knows the way

1036
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:02,040
From your heart
to your brain

1037
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:08,560
Knows that
you're whole

1038
01:19:09,640 --> 01:19:14,160
And you're shining
like the brightest star

1039
01:19:14,240 --> 01:19:19,160
A transmission
on the midnight radio

1040
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:26,560
And you're spinning

1041
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:28,520
Like a 45

1042
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:30,600
Ballerina

1043
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:36,160
Dancing to
your rock and roll...

1044
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:44,560
Here's to Patti

1045
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:47,440
And Tina

1046
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:49,520
And Yoko

1047
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:51,720
Aretha

1048
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:53,960
And Nona

1049
01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:56,880
And Nico

1050
01:19:56,960 --> 01:19:57,960
And me

1051
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:03,040
And all the strange
rock and rollers

1052
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:06,960
You know you're doing
alright

1053
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:11,880
So hold on
to each other

1054
01:20:13,960 --> 01:20:17,520
You gotta
hold on tonight

1055
01:20:19,160 --> 01:20:23,920
And you're shining
like the brightest star

1056
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:31,280
A transmission
on the midnight radio

1057
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:35,120
And you're spinning

1058
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:37,480
Your new 45s

1059
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:42,080
All the misfits
and the losers

1060
01:20:42,160 --> 01:20:46,800
Well, you know
you're rock and rollers

1061
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:51,400
Spinning to

1062
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:57,680
Your rock and roll

1063
01:21:07,080 --> 01:21:09,920
Lift up your hands

1064
01:21:11,720 --> 01:21:14,720
Lift up your hands

1065
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:19,880
Lift up your hands

1066
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:34,880
Lift up your hands

1067
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:42,080
Now! Now!

1068
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:51,240
Lift up your hands

1069
01:21:52,360 --> 01:21:55,480
Lift up your hands.

1070
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:15,680
When the earth
was still flat

1071
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:18,880
And clouds made
of fire

1072
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:22,160
And mountains stretched up
to the sky

1073
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:24,960
Sometimes higher

1074
01:23:27,640 --> 01:23:29,800
Folks roamed the earth

1075
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:31,920
Like big rolling kegs

1076
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,480
They had
two sets of arms

1077
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:36,840
They had
two sets of legs

1078
01:23:36,920 --> 01:23:41,680
They had two faces peering
out of one giant head

1079
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:44,800
So they could
watch all around them

1080
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:47,000
As they talked
while they read

1081
01:23:47,080 --> 01:23:51,120
And they never
knew nothing of love

1082
01:23:51,200 --> 01:23:55,240
It was before

1083
01:23:56,320 --> 01:23:59,000
The origin of love

1084
01:24:01,640 --> 01:24:03,880
The origin of love

1085
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:09,280
Now there was
three sexes then

1086
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:13,400
One that looked like two men
glued up back-to-back

1087
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:16,440
They called
the children of the sun

1088
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:18,800
And similar
in shape and girth

1089
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:21,480
Was the children
of the Earth

1090
01:24:21,560 --> 01:24:24,920
They looked like
two girls rolled up in one

1091
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,120
And the children
of the moon

1092
01:24:28,200 --> 01:24:30,680
Was like a fork
shoved on a spoon

1093
01:24:30,760 --> 01:24:36,360
They was part sun, part earth
part daughter, part son

1094
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:42,000
Ah-hh...
the origin of love.

1095
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:15,160
Some girls,
they got natural ease

1096
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:19,080
They wear it
any way they please

1097
01:25:19,160 --> 01:25:21,280
With their French
flip curls

1098
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:24,160
And perfumed
magazines

1099
01:25:25,640 --> 01:25:27,520
Wear it up

1100
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:29,240
Let it down

1101
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:33,440
This is the best way
that I've found

1102
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:36,960
To be the best
you've ever seen

1103
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:39,160
I put on
some makeup

1104
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:42,960
Turn on the eight-track

1105
01:25:44,160 --> 01:25:48,040
I'm pulling the wig
down from the shelf

1106
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:57,480
Suddenly I'm
Miss Farrah Fawcett from TV

1107
01:25:57,560 --> 01:25:59,600
Until I wake up

1108
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:03,040
And I turn back
to myself

1109
01:26:04,680 --> 01:26:07,800
Shag, bi-level, bob,
Dorothy Hamill do

1110
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:09,640
Sausage curls
chicken wings

1111
01:26:09,720 --> 01:26:11,240
It's all because
of you

1112
01:26:11,320 --> 01:26:12,920
With your blow-dried
feather back

1113
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:14,400
Toni Home Wave, too

1114
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:16,160
Flip, 'fro,
frizz, flop

1115
01:26:16,240 --> 01:26:19,120
It's all because
of you

1116
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:21,040
It's all because
of you.

1117
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:35,520
Okay, everybody.

1118
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:38,240
I put on some makeup

1119
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:42,040
Turn on the eight-track

1120
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:46,880
I'm pulling the wig
down from the shelf

1121
01:26:50,680 --> 01:26:53,840
Suddenly I'm
this punk rock star

1122
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:56,160
Of stage and screen

1123
01:26:56,240 --> 01:26:57,840
And I ain't never

1124
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:00,760
I'm never turning back

1125
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:39,600
Do-do-do
do-do do-do

1126
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:43,960
Do-do-do
do-do do-do.
