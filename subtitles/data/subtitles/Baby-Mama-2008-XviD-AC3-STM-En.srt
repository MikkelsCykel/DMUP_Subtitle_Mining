KATE: I did everything
that I was supposed to do:

2
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:40,342
I didn't cry in meetings:
I didn't wear short skirts:

3
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:43,480
I put up with the weird
upper management guys

4
00:00:43,557 --> 00:00:46,048
that kiss you on the mouth
at Christmas:

5
00:00:46,126 --> 00:00:48,959
Is it fair that
to be the youngest VP
in my company,

6
00:00:49,029 --> 00:00:52,260
I wiII be the oIdest mom
at preschooI?

7
00:00:52,332 --> 00:00:54,994
Not reaIIy,
but that's part of the deaI:

8
00:00:55,068 --> 00:00:57,036
I made a choice:

9
00:00:57,137 --> 00:01:00,004
Some women got pregnant:
I got promotions:

10
00:01:01,108 --> 00:01:04,100
And I stiII aspire
to meet someone

11
00:01:04,177 --> 00:01:06,407
and faII in Iove
and get married,

12
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,382
but that is
a very high-risk scenario:

13
00:01:10,484 --> 00:01:12,884
And I want a baby now:
I'm 37:

14
00:01:17,791 --> 00:01:21,557
It's too much
for a first date, isn't it?
I said too much:

15
00:01:23,196 --> 00:01:25,096

00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:20,447
Good morning:
Thank you for
being here so earIy:

22
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,748
Hi: How are you?

23
00:02:21,822 --> 00:02:23,414
Let's get started:

24
00:02:24,524 --> 00:02:26,082
(ALL BABBLING)

25
00:03:00,327 --> 00:03:01,316
That one:

26
00:04:03,089 --> 00:04:04,113
WeII:::

27
00:04:04,824 --> 00:04:07,554
I just don't Iike
your uterus:

28
00:04:07,627 --> 00:04:08,616
Don't get me wrong:

29
00:04:08,695 --> 00:04:12,187
Your eggs are in great shape,
but you have
a T-shaped uterus:

30
00:04:12,265 --> 00:04:15,530
That combined
with your advanced
maternaI age,

31
00:04:15,602 --> 00:04:17,365
it's preventing
proper impIantation:

32
00:04:17,437 --> 00:04:20,304
Why do I have
this T-shaped uterus?

33
00:04:20,373 --> 00:04:22,273
WeII, probabIy has something
to do with medication

34
00:04:22,342 --> 00:04:25,038
that was given to
your mother when
she was pregnant with you:

35
00:04:25,111 --> 00:04:26,544
We used Iot of drugs
back in the '70s

36
00:04:26,613 --> 00:04:29,673
which we now know
can cause infertiIity:

37
00:04:29,749 --> 00:04:31,011
InfertiIity?

38
00:04:31,084 --> 00:04:35,316
Yeah: I wouId say
that your chances
of conceiving are very Iow:

39
00:04:35,388 --> 00:04:36,412
How Iow?

40
00:04:36,489 --> 00:04:38,514
WeII, I don't want to
assign a number to it:

41
00:04:38,592 --> 00:04:42,585
What wouId you assign it?
A coIor, a nickname, a Iocker?

42
00:04:42,696 --> 00:04:43,890

I just don't Iike:::

45
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,667
Don't say that again:

46
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:56,842
ROSE: Come to think of it,

47
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:00,038
I did take something
for Iiver spots when
I was pregnant with you,

48
00:05:00,113 --> 00:05:04,140
but I reaIIy don't see
how that couId cause
any probIems for your uterus:

49
00:05:04,217 --> 00:05:08,119
It was just a different time:
They didn't warn peopIe
about side effects:

50
00:05:08,188 --> 00:05:09,621
ROSE: They warned me:

51
00:05:09,689 --> 00:05:11,884
I think I might even
have signed something:

52
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:12,982
What?

53
00:05:13,059 --> 00:05:17,894
Kate, I was 30 years oId:
I was starting to get
Iiver spots: Liver spots!

54
00:05:17,964 --> 00:05:20,899
I just hope you put
this baby mania to rest:

55
00:05:21,001 --> 00:05:22,298
It's not mania:

56
00:05:22,369 --> 00:05:23,859
How many times
have you tried now?

57
00:05:23,937 --> 00:05:25,962
Three?
Nine:

58
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:27,563
The Iast two
were in vitro:

59
00:05:27,641 --> 00:05:29,006
Have you considered adoption?

60
00:05:29,075 --> 00:05:31,066
I have appIied
for an adoption, yes:

61
00:05:31,144 --> 00:05:34,580
Kate, pIease don't get
a bIack baby:

62
00:05:35,582 --> 00:05:37,243
WeII, I don't think
we'II have to
worry about that,

63
00:05:37,317 --> 00:05:39,217
because for a singIe woman,

64
00:05:39,285 --> 00:05:41,014
it can take
about five years
to get an adoption:

65
00:05:41,121 --> 00:05:44,750
I've just had it
with aII these
movie stars showing off:

66
00:05:44,824 --> 00:05:47,258
''Look at me
and my bIack baby:''

67
00:05:47,327 --> 00:05:49,795
KiII me:
I want you to
stab me with something:

68
00:05:49,863 --> 00:05:52,832
You know, Kate,
not everyone is as toIerant

69
00:05:52,899 --> 00:05:55,561
of your aIternative IifestyIe
as we are:

70
00:05:56,803 --> 00:05:58,828
Being singIe is not
an aIternative IifestyIe:

71
00:05:58,905 --> 00:06:00,805
It is when you're 37:

(CHUCKLING)

00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:04,907
Oh, out Iike a Iight:

74
00:06:04,978 --> 00:06:06,502
Have you thought
about using a surrogate?

75
00:06:06,579 --> 00:06:08,171
I saw a thing
about it on DateIine:

76
00:06:08,248 --> 00:06:10,113
No, it's weird:
It's for weirdoes:

77
00:06:10,183 --> 00:06:11,673
I'm just gonna
keep trying by myseIf:

78
00:06:11,751 --> 00:06:15,209
Kate, buiIding a famiIy
is not Iike opening
one of your stores:

79
00:06:15,288 --> 00:06:19,019
It's not
an executive decision:
It's reaI Iife: It's messy:

80
00:06:19,092 --> 00:06:22,255
These hormone injections
make me want to punch you
in the face right now:

81
00:06:22,328 --> 00:06:23,454
No hitting:

82
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:24,827
That's right:
You're right:

83
00:06:24,898 --> 00:06:26,832
There you go:
Come on:

84
00:06:26,933 --> 00:06:29,629
WeII, how much Ionger
are you gonna put
your body through this?

85
00:06:29,703 --> 00:06:31,466
Look, I know for years
I said I didn't want one,

86
00:06:31,538 --> 00:06:33,335
but I just
woke up one day,

87
00:06:33,406 --> 00:06:37,137
and I feIt Iike
every baby on the street
was staring at me:

88
00:06:38,244 --> 00:06:40,610
Katie's coming out
of the mommy cIoset:

89
00:06:42,182 --> 00:06:43,706
Hey, TyIer:

90
00:06:43,783 --> 00:06:46,445
TyIer, what is this
aII over you?

91
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:48,544
Is that chocoIate
or poop?

92
00:06:49,622 --> 00:06:51,647
Is that chocoIate or poop?

93
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,052
It's chocoIate:

94
00:06:56,496 --> 00:06:58,123
What if that
had been poop?

95
00:06:58,198 --> 00:07:00,428
I toId you,
messy, but great:

96
00:07:14,848 --> 00:07:16,338
Not bad:

97
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:18,281

of this pea soup:

00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,018
It's what I do:

101
00:07:30,764 --> 00:07:32,026
You know,

102
00:07:33,466 --> 00:07:36,594
I was swimming this morning
with the doIphins
in Costa Rica,

103
00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:38,660
and I reaIized something:

104
00:07:40,874 --> 00:07:43,001
I am a great man:

105
00:07:43,076 --> 00:07:45,442
And great men do great things:

106
00:07:46,946 --> 00:07:49,676
I want to open
a fIagship store
right here in PhiIadeIphia:

107
00:07:49,749 --> 00:07:52,013
I want it to be
the biggest store
we ever buiIt,

108
00:07:52,085 --> 00:07:55,282
I want it to be made
of 100% recycIabIe materiaIs,

109
00:07:55,355 --> 00:07:59,758
and I want it to be
so beautifuI that peopIe
want to get married in it:

110
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:05,430
Kate, join me up here:

111
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,233

Won't you?

113
00:08:12,138 --> 00:08:13,230

114
00:08:18,511 --> 00:08:19,671
Okay:

115
00:08:25,385 --> 00:08:29,617

to spearhead this

HeIIo:
I'm Chaffee BickneII:

125
00:09:46,366 --> 00:09:48,095
There's just one of you:

126
00:09:48,167 --> 00:09:51,728
I thought Chaffee and BickneII
were two different peopIe:

127
00:09:56,409 --> 00:09:57,671
Come in:
CertainIy:

128
00:10:02,015 --> 00:10:05,507
I started this business
because I saw
a growth market:

129
00:10:05,585 --> 00:10:07,576
We don't do
our own taxes anymore:

130
00:10:07,654 --> 00:10:09,383
We don't program
our computers:

131
00:10:09,455 --> 00:10:10,786
We outsource:

132
00:10:10,857 --> 00:10:13,826
And what is surrogacy
if not outsourcing?

133
00:10:13,893 --> 00:10:15,861
Wait: You're not saying
my baby wouId be carried

134
00:10:15,929 --> 00:10:19,296
by some poor,
underpaid woman
in the third worId:

135
00:10:19,365 --> 00:10:20,423
No:

136
00:10:26,706 --> 00:10:28,469
We're aIso expensive:

137
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:30,805
Our fee is $100,000:

138
00:10:31,678 --> 00:10:35,409
It costs more to have
someone born than
to have someone kiIIed:

139
00:10:35,481 --> 00:10:37,073
It takes Ionger:

140
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:41,119
AII of our surrogates undergo
extensive background checks:

141
00:10:41,187 --> 00:10:43,951
CriminaI records,
credit reports,
medicaI histories

142
00:10:44,023 --> 00:10:45,888
and psychoIogicaI testing:

143
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:49,019
But why do these women do it?
Is it just for the money?

144
00:10:49,095 --> 00:10:54,032
You do your job for the money,
but I bet you Iove it
and you're good at it:

145
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,568
Let me ask you a question:

146
00:10:56,636 --> 00:10:58,399
Do you pIan on hiring a nanny?

147
00:10:58,471 --> 00:11:00,735
Of course:
I have to go back to work:

148
00:11:00,807 --> 00:11:02,434
How is this any different?

149
00:11:02,508 --> 00:11:06,842
A nanny is someone
you trust to take care
of your baby after it's born:

150
00:11:06,913 --> 00:11:12,044
A surrogate mother is someone
you trust to take care
of your baby before it's born:

151
00:11:12,118 --> 00:11:14,450
Either way it's your baby:

152
00:11:15,922 --> 00:11:17,685
And here's my baby:

153
00:11:18,658 --> 00:11:22,094
HeIIo, my sweetheart:
HeIIo, IittIe one:

154
00:11:22,161 --> 00:11:26,325
Oh, yes:
What a good girI: Yes:

155
00:11:27,633 --> 00:11:29,328
Everyone deserves this:

156
00:11:29,402 --> 00:11:32,735
That's why I wanna
remove the stigma
from surrogacy:

157
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:35,865
There's no wrong way
to make a famiIy:

158
00:11:35,975 --> 00:11:37,704
And you're proof of that:

159
00:11:37,777 --> 00:11:39,369
How do you mean?

160
00:11:39,445 --> 00:11:42,380
Just that you have
this beautifuI baby
using surrogacy:

161
00:11:42,448 --> 00:11:43,472
Oh, no:

162
00:11:43,549 --> 00:11:47,178
My husband and I
conceived Sabrina
the oId-fashioned way:

163
00:11:47,253 --> 00:11:48,880
But you're so:::
OId?

164
00:11:49,989 --> 00:11:52,753
You wouIdn't think so
if you saw my uterus:

165
00:11:52,825 --> 00:11:56,261
But you know what reaIIy made
this IittIe angeI possibIe?

166
00:11:56,329 --> 00:11:57,956
A time machine?

167
00:11:58,031 --> 00:11:59,726
A positive attitude:

168
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:01,767
You may not have
my fertiIe body,

169
00:12:01,834 --> 00:12:04,826
but with my heIp
you can stiII be a mother:

173
00:12:12,979 --> 00:12:14,446
Make the booty go
wah, wah, wah

174
00:12:14,514 --> 00:12:15,572
Nice:

175
00:12:15,648 --> 00:12:17,013
Yo, who you waiting on again?

176
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:21,247
Her name's Angie:
WeII, she might be
my surrogate mother:

177
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,413
That's right:
You got your
baby mama coming:

178
00:12:23,489 --> 00:12:25,081
You know I got
two baby mamas, right?

179
00:12:25,158 --> 00:12:27,649
No, this is different:
You had reIationships
with those women:

180
00:12:27,727 --> 00:12:29,160
No, I had no reIationships
with those women:

181
00:12:29,228 --> 00:12:31,253
I had reIations
with those women:

182
00:12:31,364 --> 00:12:34,663
No: I'm paying her:
This was set up
by an agency:

183
00:12:34,734 --> 00:12:38,101
There are contracts invoIved:
It's strictIy business:

184
00:12:38,171 --> 00:12:41,140
You pay the biIIs,
she have the baby:
That's caIIed a baby mama:

185
00:12:41,207 --> 00:12:43,869

Yo, what if that's
your baby mama?

188
00:12:49,182 --> 00:12:50,206
I don't think that's her:

I wanna spend
about 15 minutes here,

then I wanna get
my picture taken

Yeah, weII, you're gonna
have to sketch it,

'cause I didn't
bring a camera:

you were sounding ignorant:

You're sounding ignorant:

00:13:14,207 --> 00:13:16,004
Angie?
What?

201
00:13:16,075 --> 00:13:17,201
I'm Kate:

Hi:

203
00:13:20,012 --> 00:13:22,310
Nice to meet you:
This is CarI, my husband:

204
00:13:22,381 --> 00:13:23,507
Common-Iaw:

205
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,574
He aIways says that:

206
00:13:25,651 --> 00:13:27,642
WeII, pIease,
come on in:

207
00:13:30,389 --> 00:13:31,720
Thank you:

208
00:13:32,692 --> 00:13:35,661
Listen, shut her down
in drive and sIam it
into park

209
00:13:35,728 --> 00:13:36,990
or it'II start smoking, okay?

210
00:13:37,063 --> 00:13:39,224
And I'II be back with this:

211
00:13:45,605 --> 00:13:48,574
KATE: So, how Iong
have you two
been together?

212
00:13:48,641 --> 00:13:50,905
We met the summer
after I discontinued
high schooI:

213
00:13:50,977 --> 00:13:53,104
And we've been
together ever since:

214
00:13:53,179 --> 00:13:54,771
He never officiaIIy
asked me to be his wife,

215
00:13:54,847 --> 00:13:56,439
but he never asked me
to not be his wife either,

216
00:13:56,516 --> 00:13:58,780
so things are going
pretty good:

217
00:14:01,821 --> 00:14:04,984
Wow: The pIace is amazing:

218
00:14:05,158 --> 00:14:06,182
Let me:::

219
00:14:06,259 --> 00:14:07,317
BeautifuI:

220
00:14:07,393 --> 00:14:12,330
Kind of Iooks
Iike Kate Hudson's
New York pied-a-terre:

221
00:14:13,366 --> 00:14:16,460
She read that somewhere:
I don't think
she's saying it right:

222
00:14:16,536 --> 00:14:18,595
No, she's saying it right:

223
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,431
Out of aII the pIaces
that we've interviewed at,

224
00:14:21,507 --> 00:14:23,304
this is by far
the nicest:

225
00:14:23,376 --> 00:14:24,365
What does
your husband do?

226
00:14:24,443 --> 00:14:26,741
WeII, I don't
have a husband:

227
00:14:26,812 --> 00:14:30,009
Got this pIace
aII by yourseIf?
Must have a reaIIy fancy job:

228
00:14:30,082 --> 00:14:34,382
WeII, I am the
vice president of deveIopment
for Round Earth Foods:

229
00:14:34,453 --> 00:14:37,149
So you take over
if the president is shot?

230
00:14:37,223 --> 00:14:38,212
(STAMMERING) WeII:::

231
00:14:40,393 --> 00:14:42,384
I Iike your shirt:
Thanks:

232
00:14:42,461 --> 00:14:45,988
It's a shirt-vest kind of:::
I don't know:

233
00:14:46,065 --> 00:14:49,159
I just Iike making
styIes and stuff:
It's something I Iike to do:

234
00:14:50,603 --> 00:14:52,366
What, you don't
get down with rap?

235
00:14:52,438 --> 00:14:57,000
Boy, somewhere in there
I have an oId SaIt-n-Pepa CD:

236
00:14:57,243 --> 00:14:58,232
Hmm:::

237
00:14:59,779 --> 00:15:01,542
What do you do, CarI?

238
00:15:01,614 --> 00:15:04,310
CarI is an
inventorIentrepreneur:

239
00:15:04,383 --> 00:15:05,407
Yeah:

240
00:15:05,484 --> 00:15:07,748
I'm stiII Iooking
for that home run,
you know:

241
00:15:07,853 --> 00:15:12,654
I mean, when I saw
the iPod the first time,
I was Iike:::

242
00:15:12,758 --> 00:15:14,282
I mean, I couId've
kicked myseIf:

243
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,952
That was
so hard on him:

244
00:15:16,028 --> 00:15:18,087
Now we're pretty
tight on cash:

245
00:15:18,164 --> 00:15:20,155
So that Ied you
to surrogacy?

246
00:15:20,233 --> 00:15:21,495
Hey, I gotta say,

247
00:15:21,567 --> 00:15:24,866
when I first thought
about Angie carrying
someone eIse's baby,

248
00:15:24,937 --> 00:15:26,928
I feIt weird about it:

249
00:15:27,006 --> 00:15:28,496
Then I thought,
''Oh, my God,

250
00:15:28,574 --> 00:15:31,566
''if my wife's gotta have sex
with someone eIse's
husband to do this:::''

251
00:15:31,644 --> 00:15:33,271
Out of the question:
'':::that's gonna
cost extra:''

252
00:15:33,346 --> 00:15:34,836
It's out
of the question:

253
00:15:35,248 --> 00:15:37,808
ANGIE: Wow:
This is a nice view:

254
00:15:37,917 --> 00:15:39,885
So, have you
done this before?

255
00:15:39,952 --> 00:15:43,080
No: But I know I'm good
at getting pregnant:

256
00:15:43,155 --> 00:15:44,782
(STAMMERING) That's not
what I'm asking about:

257
00:15:44,857 --> 00:15:46,222
You know,
we've aII had our scares:

258
00:15:46,292 --> 00:15:48,419
No, not reaIIy:
Me neither:

259
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:54,324
Pardon my asking this,
but how many coupIes, women,

260
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,995
how many peopIe
are you interviewing
before you make your decision?

261
00:16:00,072 --> 00:16:03,132
I guess you're Iike
our sixth or seventh:

262
00:16:03,209 --> 00:16:04,938
And how's it going?

263
00:16:05,011 --> 00:16:06,842
Good:

264
00:16:06,946 --> 00:16:08,641
You know how in science
they say that

265
00:16:08,714 --> 00:16:12,343
everybody's aura gives off
a different coIor?

266
00:16:12,418 --> 00:16:14,283
I can read those auras:

267
00:16:14,353 --> 00:16:16,719
I'm very sensitive
to peopIe's energies:

268
00:16:16,822 --> 00:16:18,722
So, I meet new peopIe
and I get exhausted:

269
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:20,053
Oh, yeah:

270
00:16:21,327 --> 00:16:23,022
What coIor is my aura?

271
00:16:23,095 --> 00:16:24,255

It's Iike a sunset:

WeII, good:

277
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:37,568
Because I reaIIy hope
that you Iike me, Angie,

278
00:16:37,643 --> 00:16:42,012
because I'm asking you
for a very big favor,
you know:

279
00:16:42,081 --> 00:16:45,915
You have a God-given abiIity
that I just don't have:

280
00:16:45,985 --> 00:16:47,452
I know I couId
be good at this:

281
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,714
I think you couId, too:

282
00:16:48,788 --> 00:16:50,517
And, you know,
it's nice to feeI:::

Yeah: Needed:

I Iike aII those words:

286
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:57,624
Yeah, weII, I can't do this
without you: I've tried:

287
00:16:57,697 --> 00:16:59,392
I need you, Angie:

288
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:06,035
I'm gonna make
a decision:

289
00:17:06,105 --> 00:17:08,096
I made my decision:

290
00:17:08,207 --> 00:17:09,731
Decision made:

291
00:17:09,809 --> 00:17:13,575
Kate, I want you to
put your baby inside me:

292
00:17:13,646 --> 00:17:17,013
Angie, I'm gonna
put my baby inside you:

This stuff is good:
What's the street name
for this?

295
00:18:29,655 --> 00:18:30,849
So as you can see,

296
00:18:30,923 --> 00:18:34,984
we've transferred three
of Kate's fertiIized eggs
to your womb, Angie:

297
00:18:35,094 --> 00:18:36,891
Now with the hormones
you've been taking,

298
00:18:36,962 --> 00:18:40,454
the probabiIity
of success is about 60%:

299
00:18:40,533 --> 00:18:43,730
You shouId continue
taking the hormones and get
as much rest as possibIe:

300
00:18:43,803 --> 00:18:47,466
And in about two weeks,
you can take
a home pregnancy test:

Iike to share again:

655
00:35:39,117 --> 00:35:40,880
I mean, I'm onIy saying
because this reminded me

656
00:35:40,952 --> 00:35:44,718
of something
I was journaIing,
just the other day:

I feeI reaIIy bad
because Karen and I
are fighting a Iot,

658
00:35:47,959 --> 00:35:52,055
because I think
she's becoming
morbidIy obese:

And I keep reminding him
that she is pregnant:

00:35:55,266 --> 00:35:58,531
And then I reaIized
that I am:::

661
00:36:01,539 --> 00:36:05,100
I'm::: No:
I am::: Okay:

662
00:36:05,176 --> 00:36:09,636
I'm anorexic,
and it's reaIIy hard,
because she's so fat:

And I::: I Iove
Christopher so much,

and I'm afraid
the baby's gonna be fat:

and two fatties:

They have stores, I think:

673
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:48,378

I was a IittIe worried about
a witch carrying my chiId,

to the idea,

the therapy terms, either:
I don't go to therapy:

to say that Kate is
aIways up in my business:

Yeah:

688
00:37:25,757 --> 00:37:28,726
That means that
Kate does deserve
some input:

689
00:37:28,793 --> 00:37:32,524
But, Kate, you must remember
that a surrogate
is not your empIoyee,

690
00:37:32,597 --> 00:37:33,689
but your partner:

00:57:08,238 --> 00:57:10,468
Maybe I did,
maybe I didn't:
But I'II teII you this:

1054
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:11,564
It's gonna raise
a Iot of questions

1055
00:57:11,641 --> 00:57:12,733
when Kate takes
this down to the Iab,

1056
00:57:12,809 --> 00:57:14,743
and they start doing
DNA tests with CSI stuff,

1057
00:57:14,811 --> 00:57:16,642
and moIecuIes and proteins
and the hair foIIicIes,

1058
00:57:16,713 --> 00:57:18,044
and they're gonna
connect the dots:

1059
00:57:18,115 --> 00:57:19,480
And then you're
gonna be busted:

1060
00:57:19,549 --> 00:57:22,518
CarI, I don't wanna do
any of this anymore:

1061
00:57:23,487 --> 00:57:25,978
I want a common-Iaw divorce:

1062
00:57:26,056 --> 00:57:29,355
You wanna give me back
the ring that I made
for you in metaI shop?

1063
00:57:29,426 --> 00:57:31,087
Yeah, I do:

1064
00:57:31,161 --> 00:57:33,356
Okay, you know what?
I'II teII you when
this reIationship's over,

1065
00:57:33,430 --> 00:57:35,125
because there's a Iot
of girIs there
sitting on the bench

1066
00:57:35,198 --> 00:57:37,393
that wanna come
into this game, aII right?

1067
00:57:37,467 --> 00:57:41,164
So I am canceIing
this reIationship, okay?

1068
00:57:42,873 --> 00:57:44,238
PIease come back
to me, Angie:
Oh, my God!

1069
00:57:44,307 --> 00:57:46,775
Wait, wait!
HoId on, hoId on,
pIease!

1070
00:57:46,843 --> 00:57:50,836
I wanna say goodbye
to you proper, okay?
We owe that to one another:

1071
00:57:50,914 --> 00:57:52,848
Can we pIease
have a quickie
in the car?

1072
00:57:52,916 --> 00:57:54,281
What?
What's wrong with you?

1073
00:57:54,351 --> 00:57:58,481
You know what?
I'm not gonna be here for you
when Kate kicks you out:

1074
00:57:58,555 --> 00:58:00,386
So deaI with that:

1075
00:58:01,658 --> 00:58:04,252
My girI rocks?
My girI does not rock, okay?

1076
00:58:04,327 --> 00:58:05,919
My girI is a divorcee:

1077
00:58:05,996 --> 00:58:07,520
So I hope
you got KIeenex,

1078
00:58:07,597 --> 00:58:11,693
'cause you just said goodbye
to the cooIest thing
that ever happened to you:

1079
00:58:15,172 --> 00:58:18,801
I'm gonna bang your friends:
Consider them aII banged:

1080
00:58:57,147 --> 00:59:00,139
The reason I caIIed you
coIIect is 'cause it's gonna
take more than a few quarters

1081
00:59:00,217 --> 00:59:02,981
to express how I feeI
about you, baby:

1082
00:59:03,053 --> 00:59:05,078
Hey, where you going?

1083
00:59:08,391 --> 00:59:12,760
I knew something was up
when I saw you beating
your baby bump Iike that:

1084
00:59:13,830 --> 00:59:16,560
It wasn't supposed
to happen Iike this:

1085
00:59:16,633 --> 00:59:19,397
Everything just
got way out of hand:

1086
00:59:24,341 --> 00:59:27,174
I think
I'm just gonna spIit:

1087
00:59:27,244 --> 00:59:28,643
That's a good idea:

1088
00:59:28,712 --> 00:59:30,043
Just sIip away
in the dead of night

1089
00:59:30,113 --> 00:59:31,637
and Ieave Kate thinking
you stoIe the baby:

1090
00:59:31,715 --> 00:59:33,205
That wouId destroy her:

1091
00:59:33,283 --> 00:59:35,877
This ain't some IittIe scam
where you just caII up
Domino's and be Iike,

1092
00:59:35,952 --> 00:59:39,945
''Yo: You know, I'm doing
some church youth event:
I need 10 free pizzas:''

1093
00:59:40,023 --> 00:59:41,388
Why, does that work?

1094
00:59:41,458 --> 00:59:44,916
You're Iying
about the existence
of a human being:

1095
00:59:44,995 --> 00:59:48,954
If you don't teII her,
you'II never be abIe
to Iive with yourseIf:

1096
00:59:49,032 --> 00:59:51,057
Maybe you can teII her
after I'm gone:

1097
00:59:51,134 --> 00:59:52,829
I'II teII you
what I'm gonna do:

1098
00:59:52,903 --> 00:59:55,269
Not a damn thing,
'cause you're gonna
teII her yourseIf:

1099
00:59:59,643 --> 01:00:01,975
I've got
a surprise for you:

1100
01:00:02,045 --> 01:00:03,603
I got a surprise
for you, too:

1101
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:07,673
It is a brochure for
the PhiIadeIphia
SchooI of TextiIes:

1102
01:00:07,751 --> 01:00:09,480
They've got
a great fashion program:

1103
01:00:09,552 --> 01:00:10,644
Thanks:

1104
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:13,780
But that's not
the whoIe surprise:
Open it:

1105
01:00:14,391 --> 01:00:15,983
I'm giving you
your check earIy:

1106
01:00:16,059 --> 01:00:20,462
No, Kate: I can't take that:
You gotta put
that through the agency:

1107
01:00:20,530 --> 01:00:23,624
No, it's not gonna bounce:
Don't you trust me?

1108
01:00:29,606 --> 01:00:30,868
Where are we going?

1109
01:00:30,941 --> 01:00:32,306
You have
an uItrasound appointment:

1110
01:00:32,375 --> 01:00:35,367
What? No:
Today's Thursday:

1111
01:00:35,445 --> 01:00:37,743
UItrasound isn't Thursday:
Birthing cIass is Thursday:

1112
01:00:37,814 --> 01:00:41,113
UsuaIIy, but you're 18 weeks,
and so you have
another uItrasound:

1113
01:00:41,184 --> 01:00:43,015
I can't wait:

1114
01:00:43,086 --> 01:00:45,987
I hope the baby's
in a good position, so we can
see its IittIe profiIe,

1115
01:00:46,056 --> 01:00:49,492
because I'd reaIIy Iike
to get one of those printouts
to hang over my desk:

1116
01:00:49,559 --> 01:00:50,617
Do you think
it couId Iook
Iike me yet?

1117
01:00:50,694 --> 01:00:52,992
CouId the baby
Iook Iike you
at 18 weeks?

1118
01:00:53,063 --> 01:00:55,793
What if it has
IittIe tiny gIasses?

1119
01:00:56,833 --> 01:01:00,667
I'm joking:
That's me trying
to make a joke:

1120
01:01:01,404 --> 01:01:03,065
That's coId:
Sorry about that:

1121
01:01:03,139 --> 01:01:04,470
Just:::

1122
01:01:05,208 --> 01:01:06,698
(HUMMING)

1123
01:01:12,382 --> 01:01:15,374
If::: When you get mad,
do you stay mad
for a Iong time?

1124
01:01:15,452 --> 01:01:19,320
Yes, yes: I'm a big
grudge-hoIder, actuaIIy:

1125
01:01:19,389 --> 01:01:21,323
Hear that?
What?

1126
01:01:21,391 --> 01:01:24,087
That's your heartbeat:
You nervous?

1127
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:25,650
Yeah, a IittIe:

1128
01:01:25,729 --> 01:01:29,995
Okay, I'm just:::
Just having
a IittIe troubIe finding:::

1129
01:01:30,066 --> 01:01:31,829
You're gonna have
a Iot of troubIe:

1130
01:01:31,901 --> 01:01:34,802
Kate, I gotta
teII you something:
I'm not reaIIy:::

1131
01:01:34,871 --> 01:01:36,600
There's the baby's heartbeat:

1132
01:01:36,673 --> 01:01:37,731
(SCOFFING)

1133
01:01:37,807 --> 01:01:39,741
I'm not reaIIy::: What?
Isn't it wonderfuI?

1134
01:01:39,809 --> 01:01:40,798
HoIy shit!

1135
01:01:40,877 --> 01:01:42,674
There's a baby in there?
Yep!

1136
01:01:42,746 --> 01:01:44,839
How did it get in there?
It's a miracIe:

1137
01:01:44,914 --> 01:01:47,144
What did you
wanna teII me?

1138
01:01:48,251 --> 01:01:50,515
I'm so excited:

1139
01:01:51,521 --> 01:01:52,613
Yay!

1140
01:01:55,492 --> 01:01:58,757
What do you mean, pregnant?
I thought you was
Iying to Kate:

1141
01:01:58,828 --> 01:02:03,891
I was: I am:
It's not Kate's baby:
It's CarI's:

1142
01:02:03,967 --> 01:02:04,956
So the procedure thing:::

1143
01:02:05,035 --> 01:02:06,832
Didn't take:

1144
01:02:06,903 --> 01:02:08,962
And then I was crying,
so CarI and I did it:

1145
01:02:09,039 --> 01:02:10,506
And it's just country:

1146
01:02:10,573 --> 01:02:11,835
I missed a coupIe periods,

1147
01:02:11,908 --> 01:02:14,376
and I thought maybe it was
my hormones, you know
what I'm taIking about?

1148
01:02:14,444 --> 01:02:15,570
No, I don't know
nothing about that:

1149
01:02:15,645 --> 01:02:17,772
But then I started spotting,
and I thought
that was my period,

1150
01:02:17,847 --> 01:02:19,144
but usuaIIy I don't
have a heavy fIow:

1151
01:02:19,215 --> 01:02:21,012
(SHUSHING) Stop it:

1152
01:02:21,084 --> 01:02:24,485
My boobs didn't hurt,
so I was Iike,
''It's not my period:::''

1153
01:02:24,554 --> 01:02:26,920
You know what?
Look, I'm just gonna
Iay it out, aII right?

1154
01:02:26,990 --> 01:02:28,457
I'm not discussing
the Iady business with you:

1155
01:02:28,525 --> 01:02:30,186
I mean, I think
it's a beautifuI thing
and aII that,

1156
01:02:30,260 --> 01:02:31,955
but it's disgusting, okay?

1157
01:02:32,028 --> 01:02:33,620
And I'm afraid
if we keep
taIking about it,

1158
01:02:33,696 --> 01:02:36,688
that our cycIes
might synchronize:::

1159
01:02:36,766 --> 01:02:39,599
What am I
supposed to do, Oscar?

1160
01:02:39,669 --> 01:02:43,435
I can't cash that check:
I can't take any
of Kate's money:

1161
01:02:43,506 --> 01:02:46,942
But I am gonna stay here
untiI I figure out what to do:

1162
01:02:47,010 --> 01:02:49,240
I don't know anything
about being a mother:

1163
01:02:49,312 --> 01:02:51,041
You better start Iearning:

1164
01:02:51,114 --> 01:02:53,241
It's good
if the kid's raised here,
though, you know?

1165
01:02:53,316 --> 01:02:57,252
Better schooI,
better apartment,
better situation:

1166
01:02:59,622 --> 01:03:01,681
Is that what you want?

1167
01:03:02,992 --> 01:03:04,926
No, I wanna keep it:

1168
01:03:09,265 --> 01:03:10,789
Have you read this?

1169
01:03:10,867 --> 01:03:15,702
''One in four miIIion babies
are born with
a fuII set of teeth:''

1170
01:03:15,772 --> 01:03:18,104
Angie, it's gonna be fine:

1171
01:03:18,174 --> 01:03:19,163
Where you going?

1172
01:03:19,242 --> 01:03:20,971
I have a date
with that guy, Rob:

1173
01:03:21,044 --> 01:03:22,136
Are you gonna
teII him about me?

1174
01:03:22,212 --> 01:03:24,339
No: I've made
that mistake before:

1175
01:03:24,414 --> 01:03:25,904
It turns out
they don't Iike it

1176
01:03:25,982 --> 01:03:30,146
when you taIk about
the successfuI transfer
of embryos on the first date:

1177
01:03:30,220 --> 01:03:34,384
Read the chapter
about hermaphrodites:
You won't sIeep for a week:

1178
01:03:35,725 --> 01:03:38,387
HeIIo, foIks,
my name is Chet:
I'm your waiter:

1179
01:03:38,461 --> 01:03:41,897
Are you foIks famiIiar
with the raw food
vegan movement?

1180
01:03:41,965 --> 01:03:43,455
Yeah:
I think he is,
more than I am:

1181
01:03:43,533 --> 01:03:45,000
Yeah, yeah:

1182
01:03:45,068 --> 01:03:47,195
Okay, shouId we start
with some appetizers?

1183
01:03:47,270 --> 01:03:50,797
Yeah: How's the
sea keIp pizza?

1184
01:03:50,874 --> 01:03:53,342
That's got
a nice earthy taste,
IittIe bit of a dirt taste:

1185
01:03:53,409 --> 01:03:55,172
It's very nice:

1186
01:03:55,245 --> 01:03:57,839
SaIty: We'II stay
away from that:

1187
01:03:57,914 --> 01:03:59,381
You know what Iooks good
is the bIue aIgae?

1188
01:03:59,449 --> 01:04:01,246
You wanna just:::
Yes, yes:

1189
01:04:01,351 --> 01:04:02,340
ExceIIent:
Be right back:

1190
01:04:05,889 --> 01:04:07,720
So what kind of Iaw
did you practice?

1191
01:04:07,790 --> 01:04:10,884
Corporate: You know
when you're watching the news,

1192
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:13,554
and you see
some bIoated CEO
invoIved in a scandaI,

1193
01:04:13,630 --> 01:04:14,688
and you kind of
wonder to yourseIf,

1194
01:04:14,764 --> 01:04:17,562
''How is this prick

I'm not:

1211
01:04:55,638 --> 01:04:58,766
I'm sorry: I'm not,
I thought that you were,

1212
01:04:58,841 --> 01:05:00,103
and that's why
I took you here:

1213
01:05:00,176 --> 01:05:03,373
Because of where you work,
I never wouId have:::
Oh, God:

peppers on the side,
don't overcook the meat:

1218
01:05:14,657 --> 01:05:17,148
AIso, I'd Iike you
to sIice me a new fresh roII,

You reaIIy shouId
consider changing those
Styrofoam cups to paper ones,

1222
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:26,598
because they're very bad
for the environment:

that I am bossy
and controIIing:

1226
01:05:34,010 --> 01:05:35,910
No, that's just prejudice:

1227
01:05:35,979 --> 01:05:37,776
They caII you
bossy and controIIing
'cause you're a woman:

1228
01:05:37,847 --> 01:05:42,511
But if you were a man
doing the same stuff,
you'd just be a dick:

1229
01:05:43,086 --> 01:05:44,678
What?

1230
01:05:44,754 --> 01:05:45,778
Nothing:

1231
01:05:46,522 --> 01:05:49,184

a deaI-breaker:

you are super fruity,
aren't you?

be married to have a kid:

Kate, where you been?

I'm having second thoughts
about this Iocation:

1285
01:08:25,314 --> 01:08:26,338
Is it the taxes?

1286
01:08:26,416 --> 01:08:28,941
It's probabIy
because this pIace gives you

Oprah taught me,

I'm Kate's sister, so:::

1354
01:12:24,086 --> 01:12:26,611
We are in the same famiIy:

1355
01:12:27,223 --> 01:12:32,684
And I was just practicing
the ancient Japanese
art of karaoke:

1356
01:12:33,562 --> 01:12:35,052
Karaoke?
Yes:

1357
01:12:35,131 --> 01:12:38,897

HeIIo: Oh, weII:

1359
01:12:42,338 --> 01:12:43,669

1361

I Iive in New York City
in a pied-a-terre apartment

1362
01:12:49,445 --> 01:12:51,538
with a husband

1363
01:12:53,115 --> 01:12:56,846

He's in the stock market:

1365

So we go from city to city,

Oh, weII:

1369
01:13:09,398 --> 01:13:10,990
Different dads?
Yes:

1370
01:13:11,100 --> 01:13:12,863
We have different dads:
That's what we have:

1371
01:13:12,935 --> 01:13:15,563
We have different dads:
Thank you for that:

Does your sister
want to come with us?

1384
01:13:48,037 --> 01:13:50,164
No, she's not weII:

You can't come
back from that:

1395
01:14:19,869 --> 01:14:22,201
That's why you aIways
want to stay over here, huh?

1396
01:14:22,271 --> 01:14:24,205
It's one of the reasons:

to an exhibit of abnormaI
skuIIs at the Mutter Museum:

1406
01:14:51,033 --> 01:14:52,500
Do you need me
to get out of here?

1407
01:14:52,568 --> 01:14:54,536
No, no: No,
I was gonna see
if you wanted to come:

1408
01:14:54,603 --> 01:14:55,900
You want me
to meet your daughter?

1409
01:14:55,971 --> 01:14:58,132
Is that a bad idea?

1410

No: I reaIIy,

01:15:12,888 --> 01:15:17,518
I mean, her whoIe

is very science-fictiony:

that need to be adopted:

1417
01:15:19,328 --> 01:15:20,625
WeII, adoption
can take years:

Iike, you know,

What is that?

Or Monday:

so maybe I shouId
wait tiII Friday:

Nice to meet you:
Hi, nice to meet you:

1452
01:16:45,681 --> 01:16:47,808
And this is
our mother, Rose:

1453

How do you do?

1455

What?

1459
01:16:58,527 --> 01:17:02,088
This is a reasonabIe question:
AII my friends are asking:

1460
01:17:02,164 --> 01:17:03,825
KATE: WeII, we haven't
reaIIy taIked about it:

1461
01:17:03,899 --> 01:17:05,457
No, there's not
a Iot of stuff
we've taIked about,

1462
01:17:05,534 --> 01:17:07,195
we have a Iot of stuff
to taIk about:

1463
01:17:07,269 --> 01:17:09,965
I think Angie might want
to visit the baby
a few times a year:

1464
01:17:10,039 --> 01:17:13,031
You know, or I might be
out of town, I don't know
where I'm going:

1465
01:17:13,108 --> 01:17:15,804
ANGIE: I mean, I think
I've got pIans,
but I'II definiteIy caII:

1466
01:17:15,878 --> 01:17:18,608
Summer, if we're on vacation,
maybe Angie wouId want to
come with us some time:

1467
01:17:18,681 --> 01:17:19,909
And who knows where
we're going to be
in a year?

1468
01:17:19,982 --> 01:17:22,382
I think it's reaIIy important
that she remain a part
of the baby's Iife:

1469
01:17:22,451 --> 01:17:25,113
Yeah, you know,
or compIeteIy separate:

1470
01:17:25,187 --> 01:17:26,586
We're just going to
pIay it fast and Ioose,

1471
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:30,022
you know,
just see how it
aII shakes out:

Hi:

1474
01:17:47,576 --> 01:17:49,942
Hey, I know
it's your sister's
baby shower,

1475
01:17:50,012 --> 01:17:52,640
just, you haven't caIIed me
in days: I thought maybe
I did something wrong:

1476
01:17:52,715 --> 01:17:54,478
No, you didn't do anything:

1477
01:17:54,550 --> 01:17:56,211
Is it because
I wanted to introduce you
to my kid?

1478
01:17:56,285 --> 01:17:57,775
No, Rob, I just:::

1479
01:17:57,853 --> 01:18:00,048
I think you and I
view the worId differentIy:

1480
01:18:00,122 --> 01:18:02,590
Bad news peopIe,
party's over:

1481
01:18:03,092 --> 01:18:05,219
Start heading
for the door:
Who Iet him in here?

1482
01:18:05,294 --> 01:18:07,262
CarI, don't say
something stupid:

1483
01:18:07,329 --> 01:18:09,297
She hasn't toId you:

1484
01:18:09,665 --> 01:18:11,030
I thought since
you guys were
best friends,

1485
01:18:11,100 --> 01:18:12,362
she probabIy
toId you everything:

1486
01:18:12,434 --> 01:18:14,527
Shut your mouth, CarI:
What is going on?

1487
01:18:14,603 --> 01:18:16,833
She's not even pregnant, okay?

1488
01:18:17,106 --> 01:18:18,835
I mean, Iook:

1489
01:18:19,608 --> 01:18:21,337
Angie what is that?

1490
01:18:22,111 --> 01:18:23,510
FeeI it:

1491
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:27,241
It's moving:
Yeah, it's a baby:

01:18:27,983 --> 01:18:29,712
And it's yours:

1493
01:18:30,052 --> 01:18:31,076
What are you saying?

1494
01:18:31,153 --> 01:18:32,177
Kate,

1495
01:18:32,254 --> 01:18:34,814
I reaIIy tried to
make you a baby,
I swear:

1496
01:18:34,890 --> 01:18:35,982
What are you saying?

1497
01:18:36,058 --> 01:18:37,184
We took a test

1498
01:18:37,259 --> 01:18:39,853
as soon as we got home,
and the procedure didn't work:

1499
01:18:39,962 --> 01:18:43,398
And I was reaI,
you know, horny,
because of aII the hormones:

1500
01:18:43,465 --> 01:18:45,023
So we did it:

1501
01:18:45,334 --> 01:18:46,528
I feIt Iike a faiIure:

1502
01:18:46,602 --> 01:18:48,331
And CarI toId me
you were going
to get somebody eIse:

1503
01:18:48,404 --> 01:18:51,100
Those hormones can aIso
give you a faIse negative:

1504
01:18:51,173 --> 01:18:54,404
That's why they want you
to wait two weeks
before you take a test:

1505
01:18:54,476 --> 01:18:56,671
Wait, what?
So she might
not be pregnant?

1506
01:18:56,745 --> 01:18:58,804
Yo, where you
escape from, man?

1507
01:18:58,881 --> 01:19:02,180
I'm saying
the baby might be CarI's,
but it might stiII be mine:

1508
01:19:02,251 --> 01:19:03,843
Okay, then
forget what I said:

1509
01:19:03,919 --> 01:19:04,943
I'm trying to
pIay catch-up here:

1510
01:19:05,020 --> 01:19:07,284
So you get
your sister pregnant,

1511
01:19:07,356 --> 01:19:09,324
but she sIept with him?
No, she's not my sister:

1512
01:19:09,391 --> 01:19:13,350
She's an ignorant
white trash woman
that I paid to carry my kid:

1513
01:19:14,630 --> 01:19:15,824
I deserve that:

1514
01:19:15,898 --> 01:19:16,887
No, you don't:

1515
01:19:16,965 --> 01:19:18,023
How couId you do that?

1516
01:19:18,100 --> 01:19:19,533
This is why I didn't
caII you back, Rob,

1517
01:19:19,601 --> 01:19:22,263
because this is
the kind of seIfish,

WeII, the upside is,
it Iooks Iike
I might be a dad:

1520
01:19:28,444 --> 01:19:30,912
So if it's a boy,
I want to marry you:

1521
01:19:30,979 --> 01:19:32,003
Oh, my God:

1522
01:19:33,649 --> 01:19:34,877
What?

1523
01:19:35,317 --> 01:19:37,114
I'm so sorry
about what's happened:

1524
01:19:37,186 --> 01:19:39,814
But I think it's best
to wait untiI the pregnancy
is far enough aIong

1525
01:19:39,888 --> 01:19:42,880
for DNA testing,
before we do
