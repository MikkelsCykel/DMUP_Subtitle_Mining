00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,509
In the late 20th century,

2
00:02:30,604 --> 00:02:34,057
hostile forces inside
the United States grow strong.

3
00:02:34,151 --> 00:02:38,447
The city of Los Angeles
is ravaged by crime and immorality.

4
00:02:38,532 --> 00:02:41,238
To protect and defend its citizens,

5
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:44,864
the United States
Police Force is formed.

6
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:48,245
A presidential candidate
predicts a millennium earthquake

7
00:02:48,338 --> 00:02:50,795
will destroy LA
in divine retribution.

8
00:02:50,884 --> 00:02:52,877
Like the mighty fist of God,

9
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:55,889
Armageddon will descend upon
the city of Los Angeles -

10
00:02:55,975 --> 00:02:59,891
the city of sin,
the city of Gomorrah and Sodom -

11
00:02:59,981 --> 00:03:02,021
and waters will arise

12
00:03:02,109 --> 00:03:06,939
and separate this sinful,
sinful city from our country.

13
00:03:07,033 --> 00:03:11,329
An earthquake measuring 9.6
on the Richter scale

14
00:03:11,414 --> 00:03:18,037
hits at 12:59pm,
August 23 in the year 2000.

15
00:03:57,065 --> 00:04:00,187
After the devastation,
the Constitution is amended,

16
00:04:00,278 --> 00:04:04,574
and the newly-elected president
accepts a lifetime term of office.

17
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:07,995
The country's capital is
relocated from Washington, DC,

18
00:04:08,082 --> 00:04:11,583
to the President's home town
of Lynchburg, Virginia.

19
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:16,002
Los Angeles island is declared
no longer part of the United States,

20
00:04:16,093 --> 00:04:18,847
and becomes the deportation point

21
00:04:18,931 --> 00:04:23,761
for all people found unfit to live
in a new, moral America.

22
00:04:23,855 --> 00:04:26,643
The United States Police Force,
like an army,

23
00:04:26,734 --> 00:04:28,811
is encamped along the shoreline,

24
00:04:28,904 --> 00:04:31,230
making any escape from LA impossible.

25
00:04:31,324 --> 00:04:35,787
From the south-east of Orange
country to the north-west of Malibu,

26
00:04:35,873 --> 00:04:39,208
the Great Wall excludes LA
from the mainland.

27
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:44,006
The President's first act as
commander in chief is Directive 17-

28
00:04:44,093 --> 00:04:47,012
Once an American loses
his or her citizenship,

29
00:04:47,098 --> 00:04:52,058
they are deported to this island of
the damned and may never come back.

30
00:05:05,876 --> 00:05:08,831
Attention. We are on tactical alert.

31
00:05:08,922 --> 00:05:10,962
Remain at battle stations.

32
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:13,721
I repeat, remain at battle stations.

33
00:05:50,567 --> 00:05:54,269
This is the Police Channel,
and this is Prime News.

34
00:05:54,364 --> 00:05:57,651
In a late-breaking story,
the Force has announced

35
00:05:57,744 --> 00:06:01,245
the arrival of the most
notorious outlaw in US history

36
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:06,293
at Firebase Seven, the deportation
centre for Los Angeles island.

37
00:06:06,382 --> 00:06:08,506
Now this on-the-scene report.

38
00:06:08,594 --> 00:06:11,881
War hero. Criminal.
The Force's most wanted man.

39
00:06:11,974 --> 00:06:13,967
Convicted of 27 moral crimes.

40
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:18,309
Arrested two weeks ago on a charge
of gunfighting for profit

41
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,106
in New Vegas, Thailand,
US territory.

42
00:06:21,196 --> 00:06:25,029
It's been 16 years since
his famous rescue in New York,

43
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:28,239
and the reports
of Plissken sightings...

44
00:06:28,331 --> 00:06:29,874
Commander?

45
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:33,044
I'm still getting a trace
from the rescue team, sir.

46
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:36,548
- Stationary signal?
- Has not moved from this location.

47
00:06:37,637 --> 00:06:41,007
That means he's hiding,
captured, or dead.

48
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,224
So we go with Plissken?

49
00:06:43,312 --> 00:06:45,352
He's all we've got.

50
00:07:11,061 --> 00:07:13,221
Hello, Plissken.

51
00:07:13,315 --> 00:07:15,355
Welcome to LA.

52
00:07:21,243 --> 00:07:23,284
Come on. Move it.

53
00:07:27,878 --> 00:07:31,960
- That's Snake Plissken?
- What did you expect?

54
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:35,967
He just looks so retro.
Kind of 20th century.

55
00:07:36,057 --> 00:07:38,929
Good old days. Let's get going.

56
00:07:43,651 --> 00:07:46,773
You are now entering
the deportation centre.

57
00:07:46,864 --> 00:07:51,030
You have been found guilty
of moral crimes against the USA

58
00:07:51,121 --> 00:07:55,203
and sentenced to permanent expulsion
beyond its borders.

59
00:07:55,293 --> 00:08:00,172
Failure to follow instructions
will be met with use of force.

60
00:08:00,259 --> 00:08:02,051
Look at 'em, Plissken.

61
00:08:02,137 --> 00:08:05,389
Prostitutes, atheists, runaways...

62
00:08:05,475 --> 00:08:08,347
We're throwing out the trash.

63
00:08:09,064 --> 00:08:13,194
"SD Bob Plissken,
Special Forces." Two Purple Hearts?

64
00:08:13,278 --> 00:08:16,566
Youngest man ever decorated
by the President.

65
00:08:16,658 --> 00:08:18,948
Rescued a different president in '97.

66
00:08:19,037 --> 00:08:21,161
So, what happened to you, war hero?

67
00:08:21,249 --> 00:08:24,370
You were the best.
Now you're just like them.

68
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:29,209
You had it all and you turned away
from your country. Why?

69
00:08:29,302 --> 00:08:31,592
The whole nation's watching.

70
00:08:31,681 --> 00:08:36,475
Every good and decent person
who works hard and follows the rules.

71
00:08:36,563 --> 00:08:39,649
Be my guest.
What do you have to say, Plissken?

72
00:08:40,903 --> 00:08:43,276
Call me Snake.

73
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,206
You are now entering
the processing area.

74
00:08:50,292 --> 00:08:53,662
The next scheduled departure
to LA is in one hour.

75
00:09:06,441 --> 00:09:09,526
You now have the option
to repent of your sins

76
00:09:09,612 --> 00:09:13,113
and be electrocuted
on the premises.

77
00:09:13,201 --> 00:09:15,325
If you elect this option,

78
00:09:15,412 --> 00:09:19,542
notify the cleric sergeant
in your processing area.

79
00:10:08,867 --> 00:10:10,907
How's it going, hotshot?

80
00:10:14,124 --> 00:10:16,165
You know, I got to admit.

81
00:10:16,252 --> 00:10:18,959
I thought we had you in Cleveland.

82
00:10:20,133 --> 00:10:23,919
- How'd you do it?
- Get to the deal.

83
00:10:24,014 --> 00:10:27,016
- What?
- You need me for something. What?

84
00:10:27,102 --> 00:10:29,142
Show him.

85
00:10:47,173 --> 00:10:50,758
At 1030 hours, Wednesday,
a group of government officials

86
00:10:50,845 --> 00:10:53,848
began a tour
of the Benford Space Defence lab.

87
00:10:53,933 --> 00:10:56,936
The President's daughter,
Utopia, was among them.

88
00:10:57,021 --> 00:11:00,724
During the tour, she came into
possession of a top-secret prototype.

89
00:11:00,819 --> 00:11:04,070
Then she boarded
Air Force Three for Lynchburg.

90
00:11:04,157 --> 00:11:06,197
To the American people -

91
00:11:06,285 --> 00:11:11,080
now is the time to rise up and demand
the surrender of the President

92
00:11:11,167 --> 00:11:15,796
and his corrupt theocracy
of lies and terror!

93
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:19,585
At 1140 hours,
she hijacked Air Force Three.

94
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,264
We scanned this onto the VR.

95
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,892
Check it out.

96
00:11:26,982 --> 00:11:31,278
Today is day one
of a brand-new world.

97
00:11:31,364 --> 00:11:34,152
The days of empire are finished.

98
00:11:34,243 --> 00:11:37,495
To the President, my father...

99
00:11:37,581 --> 00:11:39,575
You know what's in here,

100
00:11:39,668 --> 00:11:42,077
and unless you open your borders,

101
00:11:42,172 --> 00:11:46,752
allow all the wrongfully accused
to return to their country,

102
00:11:46,845 --> 00:11:51,260
I will use this on you
and on the United States.

103
00:12:01,492 --> 00:12:04,744
Her emergency escape pod
landed somewhere in LA.

104
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:09,079
Her ELT signal ceased immediately.
After that, silence.

105
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:11,662
We sent a five-man rescue team.

106
00:12:11,757 --> 00:12:15,377
Within hours of landing
all but one was killed.

107
00:12:15,471 --> 00:12:17,096
Hell of a team.

108
00:12:17,182 --> 00:12:20,433
Skip the commentary, Plissken.

109
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,430
Call me Snake.

110
00:12:22,523 --> 00:12:24,517
Get on with it.

111
00:12:24,609 --> 00:12:26,733
After her sister committed suicide,

112
00:12:26,821 --> 00:12:30,358
Utopia began to withdraw
into her virtual reality simulator.

113
00:12:30,451 --> 00:12:34,747
She'd punch up her own world
and stay in it for days.

114
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:36,661
Somebody else was in there.

115
00:12:36,752 --> 00:12:40,669
Utopia made tapes of her VR
experiences and tried to erase them,

116
00:12:40,758 --> 00:12:42,882
but she missed one image.

117
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:47,136
We found this fragment
on the end of her last tape.

118
00:12:47,226 --> 00:12:52,935
Cuervo Jones. Peruvian terrorist.
Shining Path member.

119
00:12:53,027 --> 00:12:55,067
Runs the Mescalito Justice,

120
00:12:55,155 --> 00:12:57,445
biggest, baddest gang in LA.

121
00:12:57,533 --> 00:13:02,328
Somehow, Cuervo Jones managed
to tap into the VR master data bank.

122
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:05,453
Utopia was looking
for something to believe in,

123
00:13:05,545 --> 00:13:08,916
so he used her
to steal the black box.

124
00:13:09,009 --> 00:13:12,011
Sad story. You got a smoke?

125
00:13:12,097 --> 00:13:14,090
This is serious, Plissken.

126
00:13:14,183 --> 00:13:16,971
The black box is a matter
of national security.

127
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:20,932
Looks like it belongs
to Utopia's lover-boy now.

128
00:13:21,026 --> 00:13:23,697
Yeah. We want it back.

129
00:13:23,781 --> 00:13:25,821
I'll bet.

130
00:13:26,952 --> 00:13:28,661
What's it do?

131
00:13:28,746 --> 00:13:32,366
Top secret. Only on a need-to-know.

132
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,869
Evidently, I don't need to know,

133
00:13:34,964 --> 00:13:37,171
so fuck you, I'm going to Hollywood.

134
00:13:37,259 --> 00:13:41,590
If you go into LA,
bring back the black box,

135
00:13:41,682 --> 00:13:46,845
and you will receive a pardon for
every immoral act you have committed.

136
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,933
Sounds familiar.

137
00:13:49,026 --> 00:13:51,269
An immediate answer.

138
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:54,403
Yes or no?

139
00:13:56,955 --> 00:13:58,782
Who are you?

140
00:13:58,874 --> 00:14:01,545
I'm your president.

141
00:14:01,628 --> 00:14:04,299
I understand you got
some domestic problems.

142
00:14:04,382 --> 00:14:08,216
Put that black box in my hand,
and you're a free man.

143
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:15,522
I can see you're real concerned
about your daughter.

144
00:14:15,607 --> 00:14:17,897
Utopia is lost to me.
My daughter is gone.

145
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:22,985
- Last chance, hotshot.
- For what?

146
00:14:23,077 --> 00:14:24,572
Freedom, sir.

147
00:14:24,662 --> 00:14:28,496
In America?
That died a long time ago.

148
00:14:28,585 --> 00:14:30,626
I've heard enough of this.

149
00:14:30,713 --> 00:14:36,719
Explain to this foot soldier why he's
going to do what we tell him to do.

150
00:14:37,014 --> 00:14:39,423
What's he talking about?

151
00:14:39,518 --> 00:14:41,808
The Plutoxin Seven virus.

152
00:14:41,896 --> 00:14:46,477
Genetically engineered.
100% pure death.

153
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:48,943
Complete nervous system shut-down.

154
00:14:49,032 --> 00:14:54,111
You crash. You bleed out like
a stuck pig. It's not a pretty sight.

155
00:14:56,042 --> 00:14:57,917
I see.

156
00:14:58,004 --> 00:15:02,300
You figure I'll do whatever you
want, just like New York, huh?

157
00:15:02,385 --> 00:15:05,056
- You got it... Snake.
- One question.

158
00:15:05,139 --> 00:15:08,307
Which one of you assholes gets to die
trying to stick me?

159
00:15:08,394 --> 00:15:11,978
You don't understand.
It's already in you.

160
00:15:16,573 --> 00:15:18,697
Catches on quick, doesn't he?

161
00:15:22,373 --> 00:15:25,958
Your countdown clock
is now activated.

162
00:15:26,045 --> 00:15:29,131
Designer viruses, Plissken.
Wave of the future.

163
00:15:29,217 --> 00:15:31,970
You've got less than ten hours
to live.

164
00:15:32,054 --> 00:15:36,849
It's already moving through your
bloodstream. Go on-touch that pad.

165
00:15:41,652 --> 00:15:43,978
Of course, there is an antidote,

166
00:15:44,072 --> 00:15:47,774
and it neutralises the virus
immediately upon injection.

167
00:15:47,869 --> 00:15:51,406
Which I will personally authorise
once your mission is completed.

168
00:15:55,255 --> 00:15:59,171
The man is too dumb to survive LA.

169
00:16:00,346 --> 00:16:02,803
We're holograms, Plissken.

170
00:16:03,225 --> 00:16:06,928
Give us a little credit.
We're not that stupid.

171
00:16:12,406 --> 00:16:14,862
Get this crap out of me.

172
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,616
I guess we've got a deal.

173
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:27,175
Nice to be working with you, hotshot.

174
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:32,382
You'd better hope
I don't make it back.

175
00:16:32,477 --> 00:16:34,387
All of you.

176
00:16:36,191 --> 00:16:38,730
Core burner, magnesium ammo,

177
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:41,229
500 extra rounds.

178
00:16:41,323 --> 00:16:46,665
Oral projectile. Mouth dart, filled
with urolyde. It will stun the enemy.

179
00:16:46,748 --> 00:16:50,451
Every member of the rescue team
had a tracking chip in his arm.

180
00:16:50,545 --> 00:16:55,673
One might still be alive. Use the
tracer in your watch to locate him.

181
00:16:55,762 --> 00:17:00,509
This holographic camera will project
your image up to a half-mile away.

182
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:02,643
100% audio capability.

183
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,519
It's a prototype.
Confuse and deceive the enemy.

184
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:10,321
Its mini-nuke battery is good for
eight minutes, but only works once.

185
00:17:10,408 --> 00:17:12,698
Save it for when it counts.

186
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:19,583
Plain old-fashioned matches.
Never know when you might need them.

187
00:17:22,134 --> 00:17:24,009
Where are my guns?

188
00:17:24,095 --> 00:17:26,587
I thought you might want those.

189
00:17:33,109 --> 00:17:37,025
Stealth clothing. Fire retardant,
nullifies heat detection.

190
00:17:37,115 --> 00:17:38,942
Put them on.

191
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:46,082
I'll take the coat.

192
00:17:46,754 --> 00:17:48,582
You'll take 'em all.

193
00:18:42,378 --> 00:18:47,755
All right. LA's being primed as a
beachhead for an invasion of the US.

194
00:18:47,844 --> 00:18:51,096
War is being declared,
Plissken, or didn't you know?

195
00:18:51,183 --> 00:18:54,055
Oh, I forgot. You don't give a shit.

196
00:18:54,145 --> 00:18:57,433
Cuervo Jones runs Shining Path.
They want North America.

197
00:18:57,525 --> 00:19:00,278
The revenge
of preindustrial societies.

198
00:19:00,363 --> 00:19:02,902
Shining Path has united
Third World countries.

199
00:19:02,992 --> 00:19:05,662
The Cubans and Brazilians
will invade Miami.

200
00:19:05,746 --> 00:19:10,077
The Colombians are at the border,
we've got a full-scale attack.

201
00:19:10,169 --> 00:19:13,125
- High stakes.
- How am I going in?

202
00:19:13,215 --> 00:19:17,464
Under the San Fernando Sea. Shark
Three submarine, one-man submersible.

203
00:19:17,555 --> 00:19:21,257
Just like the turbine model,
only this one's nuclear-powered.

204
00:19:21,352 --> 00:19:24,640
It's very simple.
Throttle up, throttle back.

205
00:19:24,732 --> 00:19:26,940
Put ashore at the Cuegan Pass.

206
00:19:27,027 --> 00:19:30,030
Go through the mountains
toward the Hollywood Bowl.

207
00:19:30,115 --> 00:19:32,690
Locate the survivor
of the rescue team.

208
00:19:32,786 --> 00:19:34,993
He's your only source of information.

209
00:19:35,081 --> 00:19:37,656
- Do I bring him back?
- Negative.

210
00:19:37,752 --> 00:19:40,707
- Figures.
- He's probably already dead.

211
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:43,919
Once you go inside,
you're on your own.

212
00:19:44,011 --> 00:19:47,049
Get the black box
back to the submarine.

213
00:19:47,141 --> 00:19:49,929
It's your only way out.
Plissken!

214
00:19:50,688 --> 00:19:53,394
You know what to do with the girl.

215
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:57,898
We don't need to waste any more time
and money on bullshit trials.

216
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:59,319
Kill her.

217
00:19:59,409 --> 00:20:01,866
Is that order from the President?

218
00:20:01,954 --> 00:20:05,241
Absolutely. Let's just say
it's best for the country.

219
00:20:05,334 --> 00:20:08,752
By the way,
who gives me the antidote?

220
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:11,877
- A medical team.
- Neither of you?

221
00:20:11,969 --> 00:20:13,381
- No.
- Good.

222
00:20:16,768 --> 00:20:21,349
Thought you'd try that, hotshot.
The first clip is loaded with blanks.

223
00:20:21,442 --> 00:20:23,269
Bye bye, Snake. Good luck.

224
00:20:28,035 --> 00:20:30,112
Nice and easy now.

225
00:20:46,771 --> 00:20:50,058
- Com check.
- Yeah. I'm here.

226
00:20:50,151 --> 00:20:51,776
Stand by for launch.

227
00:20:51,862 --> 00:20:54,734
Eight hours, eight minutes,
26 seconds

228
00:20:54,824 --> 00:20:56,865
to neurosystem shut-down.

229
00:20:58,997 --> 00:21:01,074
Ignitor.

230
00:21:04,088 --> 00:21:06,545
Fuel rod injection.

231
00:21:09,972 --> 00:21:11,716
She's in the green.

232
00:21:11,808 --> 00:21:15,261
- Lock fuel rods.
- Locked.

233
00:21:15,355 --> 00:21:17,562
Nuclear turbine to 75% power.

234
00:21:24,368 --> 00:21:25,863
75% power.

235
00:21:25,954 --> 00:21:28,161
Hands on switches and counting.

236
00:21:28,249 --> 00:21:29,245
Five...

237
00:21:29,334 --> 00:21:31,244
four... three...

238
00:21:31,337 --> 00:21:33,295
two... one.

239
00:21:33,382 --> 00:21:35,174
Launch.

240
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:11,970
Watch your speed.
There's lots of obstructions.

241
00:22:20,785 --> 00:22:23,360
His reactor's starting to overheat.

242
00:22:23,456 --> 00:22:26,411
Slow down, you're overloading
the power plant!

243
00:22:26,502 --> 00:22:28,792
You slow down, dickhead.
I'm dying.

244
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,921
Plissken!

245
00:22:32,219 --> 00:22:34,093
Power plant overload.

246
00:22:38,102 --> 00:22:40,856
Guidance systems malfunction.

247
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:43,397
You no longer have
control stick function.

248
00:22:43,485 --> 00:22:44,861
Obstruction ahead.

249
00:24:07,109 --> 00:24:09,150
Plissken.

250
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:12,862
Yeah. I'm here. Cuegan Pass.

251
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:16,821
'What happened to the submarine?
It disappeared off our screens.

252
00:24:16,916 --> 00:24:18,874
Plissken!

253
00:24:20,296 --> 00:24:22,420
I gotta go.

254
00:24:28,224 --> 00:24:30,467
Too bad about your boat, man,

255
00:24:30,561 --> 00:24:34,395
but we'd appreciate it
if you'd stay off our beach.

256
00:24:34,483 --> 00:24:36,524
Just passing through.

257
00:24:38,239 --> 00:24:40,862
You look kind of familiar.

258
00:25:47,425 --> 00:25:49,715
- What do you want?
- Nothin'.

259
00:25:49,803 --> 00:25:53,256
- I just recognised you, that's all.
- That's all?

260
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:56,472
Come on, man.
I'm not looking for trouble.

261
00:26:01,863 --> 00:26:05,779
I used to see you a lot
when I surfed, on the Police Channel.

262
00:26:05,869 --> 00:26:09,074
You're pretty far out, Snake.
I mean, cool.

263
00:26:09,165 --> 00:26:13,580
But I kind of thought
you'd be... taller.

264
00:26:13,672 --> 00:26:15,832
Which way to the Hollywood Bowl?

265
00:26:15,925 --> 00:26:17,919
Down that way.

266
00:26:20,098 --> 00:26:23,932
It's just an aftershock.
We get them all the time.

267
00:26:24,021 --> 00:26:27,308
Thanks for not killing me, man.
I owe you one.

268
00:26:27,401 --> 00:26:29,441
Acid rain.

269
00:26:30,197 --> 00:26:33,733
Hey, Snake,
what are you doing here anyway?

270
00:26:35,663 --> 00:26:39,116
I heard they busted you
pretty good in Cleveland.

271
00:27:01,994 --> 00:27:04,830
Location of rescue team member -

272
00:27:04,915 --> 00:27:07,241
50 yards from your present position.

273
00:27:20,354 --> 00:27:25,517
Location of rescue team member -
40 yards from your present position.

274
00:27:36,754 --> 00:27:41,382
Rescue team member is located
10 feet from your present position.

275
00:27:47,394 --> 00:27:50,931
100 bucks says you can't
put three blades into him.

276
00:27:51,025 --> 00:27:53,065
Want a throw?

277
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,736
Hey, one-eye, I'm talking to you.

278
00:27:56,825 --> 00:27:59,496
Where can I find Cuervo Jones?

279
00:27:59,579 --> 00:28:03,080
What do I look like,
a fucking tour guide?

280
00:28:12,056 --> 00:28:15,676
- It's wintertime, baby.
- I'm looking for Cuervo Jones.

281
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:18,013
Why? Hershe's looking for Cuervo too.

282
00:28:18,107 --> 00:28:23,104
- Where is he?
- He's on Sunset. He's gonna come by.

283
00:28:23,198 --> 00:28:24,692
Sunset.

284
00:28:24,783 --> 00:28:28,913
Boulevard. Ooh-hoo,
you really are new, aren't you?

285
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:31,704
Come on, baby. I'll show you.

286
00:28:37,302 --> 00:28:41,218
Keep going down that way, honey.
You can't miss it.

287
00:28:45,814 --> 00:28:47,855
Hey, one-eye!

288
00:28:48,694 --> 00:28:52,645
Look in my face
when I talk to you, shit-heel.

289
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:56,533
Whoa!

290
00:30:07,602 --> 00:30:09,181
Neurosystem shut-down-seven hours.

291
00:30:11,358 --> 00:30:12,769
Plissken.

292
00:30:15,489 --> 00:30:16,900
Yeah?

293
00:30:17,116 --> 00:30:19,525
Did you find the team member?

294
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:22,576
Yeah, they're using him
for target practice.

295
00:30:22,666 --> 00:30:23,947
What will you do?

296
00:30:24,043 --> 00:30:27,580
Amigos, no matter
where you come from,

297
00:30:27,674 --> 00:30:32,385
or what colour you are, we're
all the Russia of the oppressed!

298
00:30:32,473 --> 00:30:35,179
- Watch the parade.
- What?

299
00:30:35,268 --> 00:30:38,721
We've got the north by the balls.

300
00:30:38,815 --> 00:30:41,652
Come on! Right? Right?

301
00:30:41,736 --> 00:30:45,023
Meet me at the Happy Kingdom.

302
00:30:45,116 --> 00:30:47,157
Let's party tonight,

303
00:30:47,244 --> 00:30:52,407
because tomorrow we're going to
start our way back to glory!

304
00:31:15,745 --> 00:31:21,288
Yeah! We got our freedom!
We got a future!

305
00:32:07,238 --> 00:32:09,362
That looks like Snake Plissken.

306
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:10,648
Who?

307
00:32:10,743 --> 00:32:14,909
Used to be a gunfighter. Faded
out from the scene a few years ago.

308
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:19,663
I hear he slowed down some.

309
00:32:31,065 --> 00:32:33,272
Doesn't look that slow, Cuervo.

310
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,769
Watch it! Watch it!

311
00:33:01,193 --> 00:33:02,439
No!

312
00:33:02,528 --> 00:33:05,650
Nobody rolls into town
and disrespects me.

313
00:33:05,741 --> 00:33:08,613
Not Snake Plissken, not nobody.
Bolas!

314
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:30,691
Take him out!

315
00:33:48,054 --> 00:33:50,891
I'm gonna give
you assholes a chance.

316
00:33:53,395 --> 00:33:55,970
What do you say
we play a little...

317
00:33:56,066 --> 00:33:57,976
Bangkok rules?

318
00:34:29,824 --> 00:34:32,946
Nobody draws
until this hits the ground.

319
00:34:35,917 --> 00:34:37,542
You ready?

320
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:52,475
Draw.

321
00:35:10,844 --> 00:35:13,846
Hey, he left his coat here, man.

322
00:35:24,405 --> 00:35:25,734
Malloy.

323
00:35:27,702 --> 00:35:30,408
Plissken.
Have you got the black box?

324
00:35:30,498 --> 00:35:33,204
Negative. And I've lost
the core burner and holocam.

325
00:35:33,294 --> 00:35:36,711
I don't need to know your problems,
I just want my black box.

326
00:35:36,799 --> 00:35:40,715
You've got seven and a half hours.
Do you read me?

327
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:46,269
Listen, Malloy. This guy's got more
heat around him than the President.

328
00:35:46,355 --> 00:35:49,690
I'll get your box,
but I need time, understand?

329
00:35:49,776 --> 00:35:53,990
Listen, Plissken, that headache that
just kicked in will only get worse.

330
00:35:54,074 --> 00:35:57,112
You're starting to feel
the effects of the virus.

331
00:35:57,204 --> 00:35:59,245
Soon you'll have a fever.

332
00:35:59,332 --> 00:36:03,462
Now, you bear that in mind.
Just push on through, soldier.

333
00:36:41,102 --> 00:36:44,805
Oh, don't shoot. Don't shoot.

334
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,810
I thought it was you.

335
00:36:46,903 --> 00:36:49,311
Yeah, I recognised you right away.

336
00:36:49,406 --> 00:36:51,863
I've been hangin' round here
for years,

337
00:36:51,952 --> 00:36:54,622
but I never thought I'd see
Snake Plissken.

338
00:36:54,706 --> 00:36:57,412
It's a real pleasure to meet you.

339
00:36:57,502 --> 00:36:59,745
I'm Map To The Stars Eddie.

340
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:03,464
Where's Cuervo Jones' place?

341
00:37:03,552 --> 00:37:06,259
He's the man with
the President's daughter.

342
00:37:06,348 --> 00:37:11,143
He's setting up something big, but I
got a feeling you know that, right?

343
00:37:12,274 --> 00:37:13,685
Location.

344
00:37:13,776 --> 00:37:14,975
That way.

345
00:37:16,405 --> 00:37:20,321
If you're going through Beverly
Hills, you're gonna need a map.

346
00:37:21,078 --> 00:37:23,535
It's pre-recorded.
I narrated it myself.

347
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:28,295
Welcome to your own map to the stars.

348
00:37:28,381 --> 00:37:29,924
That's me.

349
00:37:30,008 --> 00:37:33,295
The big one wiped out the
entertainment industry in LA,

350
00:37:33,388 --> 00:37:36,344
but the glamour of Hollywood
is still alive,

351
00:37:36,434 --> 00:37:38,808
so come and see where the stars...

352
00:37:38,896 --> 00:37:41,852
Hey, Snake, you'll need this.
I'm telling you.

353
00:37:41,943 --> 00:37:46,025
I'll give you a deal. 50,000 bucks.
That's a real bargain!

354
00:37:46,116 --> 00:37:48,952
...Map To The Stars Eddie,
and here we go.

355
00:37:49,037 --> 00:37:50,366
Sucker.

356
00:38:22,628 --> 00:38:24,752
Stay down, man, or they'll see you.

357
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:28,590
It's only their second shift.
Don't make one move.

358
00:38:29,597 --> 00:38:34,012
If you want to make noise,
go and find another bush.

359
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:36,678
You're the one making all the noise.

360
00:38:51,379 --> 00:38:52,874
Ah, shit!

361
00:39:00,518 --> 00:39:03,306
Plissken's tracer just went down.

362
00:39:03,397 --> 00:39:04,595
Terminated?

363
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:07,728
Yes. We can't locate him -
he's wearing stealth.

364
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:10,573
- Now what?
- We sit tight and wait.

365
00:39:10,658 --> 00:39:13,530
Wait? For how long?
He's probably dead.

366
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:15,495
Wait, Mr President. Be patient.

367
00:39:45,084 --> 00:39:48,454
I told you to stay down.
Look what you've done.

368
00:39:48,547 --> 00:39:50,588
I can't believe this.

369
00:39:51,635 --> 00:39:53,675
Are you Snake Plissken?

370
00:39:55,891 --> 00:39:58,977
You look like him... in a way.

371
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:04,689
By the way, genius,
we're both dead meat.

372
00:40:12,666 --> 00:40:14,624
What are they?

373
00:40:14,711 --> 00:40:17,381
Surgical failures.

374
00:40:17,465 --> 00:40:19,340
They live here.

375
00:40:19,426 --> 00:40:22,844
Too many implants and face-lifts
over the years.

376
00:40:22,931 --> 00:40:24,972
Their muscles turn to Jell-O.

377
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:28,430
They only survive
by having fresh body parts

378
00:40:28,523 --> 00:40:31,728
transplanted over and over again.

379
00:40:35,992 --> 00:40:37,535
Oh, my God.

380
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:39,660
Who's that?

381
00:40:41,751 --> 00:40:45,003
The surgeon general of Beverly Hills.

382
00:40:46,383 --> 00:40:48,423
These are no good.

383
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:52,929
You couldn't give them away.

384
00:40:53,018 --> 00:40:54,596
And this...

385
00:40:55,980 --> 00:41:00,062
I can do nothing with this one.
Wheel it away.

386
00:41:01,322 --> 00:41:04,028
I can't work with garbage like this.

387
00:41:06,997 --> 00:41:09,037
Now, these two...

388
00:41:11,837 --> 00:41:13,878
They look very good.

389
00:41:18,889 --> 00:41:20,930
My God, they're real.

390
00:41:37,417 --> 00:41:39,457
What a beautiful blue eye.

391
00:41:39,545 --> 00:41:41,788
Shame he only has one.

392
00:41:41,882 --> 00:41:44,255
Nurse!

393
00:41:44,344 --> 00:41:45,922
Still...

394
00:41:47,807 --> 00:41:50,015
One eye's better than none.

395
00:42:01,035 --> 00:42:04,287
Anybody moves, I'll blow
his brains out and then yours.

396
00:42:06,877 --> 00:42:09,085
You... get my guns.

397
00:42:09,172 --> 00:42:11,332
Now.

398
00:42:16,892 --> 00:42:19,301
Back off.

399
00:42:19,396 --> 00:42:21,555
Now, everybody relax,
and he won't die.

400
00:42:21,649 --> 00:42:24,224
Hey. Hey, man, help me.

401
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:28,616
You'll never find your way
out of here without me.

402
00:42:28,701 --> 00:42:30,161
Really.

403
00:42:30,245 --> 00:42:32,239
Cut her down.

404
00:42:45,351 --> 00:42:47,143
Down there.

405
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:52,562
Quickly.

406
00:42:55,783 --> 00:42:57,824
Get in.

407
00:43:20,486 --> 00:43:22,610
I think we lost them.

408
00:43:24,075 --> 00:43:26,069
I think we're lost.

409
00:43:26,161 --> 00:43:28,369
This way.

410
00:43:29,875 --> 00:43:33,957
I used to run guns
with the Black Jihad last year.

411
00:43:34,048 --> 00:43:37,383
We drove golf carts
up and down these tunnels.

412
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:40,757
I know them
like the back of my hand.

413
00:43:43,228 --> 00:43:45,436
You are Snake Plissken, aren't you?

414
00:43:45,523 --> 00:43:47,434
I used to be.

415
00:43:47,526 --> 00:43:49,567
I thought you'd be taller.

416
00:43:50,906 --> 00:43:53,944
- What are you doing in LA?
- Dying.

417
00:43:54,036 --> 00:43:57,952
Ooh. But first
you got to find something?

418
00:43:58,042 --> 00:44:01,044
President's daughter.
She's with Cuervo Jones.

419
00:44:01,130 --> 00:44:03,918
You want to go to Cuervo's place?

420
00:44:04,009 --> 00:44:07,012
- I've been there once.
- Show me.

421
00:44:07,097 --> 00:44:09,138
All right.

422
00:44:09,935 --> 00:44:11,975
I always heard about you,

423
00:44:12,063 --> 00:44:14,935
like they couldn't catch you
no matter what you did.

424
00:44:15,026 --> 00:44:17,019
Very cool, Snake.

425
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:19,984
Sooner or later, they get everybody.

426
00:44:20,075 --> 00:44:21,902
Up.

427
00:44:38,978 --> 00:44:42,514
Cuervo Jones' place is down that way.

428
00:44:42,608 --> 00:44:47,438
Get off at the Vermont exit.
Go south. You can't miss it.

429
00:44:47,532 --> 00:44:50,700
Be careful, though.
This is Korean Dragon territory.

430
00:44:50,787 --> 00:44:53,873
It's very dangerous around here.

431
00:44:53,958 --> 00:44:55,750
Bye.

432
00:44:57,672 --> 00:44:59,713
Snake?

433
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:03,879
When you find
the President's daughter,

434
00:45:03,973 --> 00:45:06,512
are you going to take her back?

435
00:45:06,602 --> 00:45:08,643
No.

436
00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:11,768
- You're staying in LA?
- Not if I can help it.

437
00:45:14,197 --> 00:45:17,318
Sun is coming up in a few hours.

438
00:45:17,410 --> 00:45:19,534
UV's gonna be bad today.

439
00:45:19,621 --> 00:45:24,001
I know a place where
we could crash...

440
00:45:24,086 --> 00:45:26,127
if you want.

441
00:45:26,214 --> 00:45:30,428
My boyfriend and I
broke up tonight, so...

442
00:45:30,512 --> 00:45:33,183
I'd love to take care of you...

443
00:45:35,478 --> 00:45:37,887
and make you feel good.

444
00:45:39,025 --> 00:45:41,482
I'll read your future.

445
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:45,780
The future is right now.

446
00:46:13,117 --> 00:46:15,656
...and condemn the innocent blood.

447
00:46:15,746 --> 00:46:21,419
Dear God, we call on you to be
our defence and our refuge.

448
00:46:21,505 --> 00:46:23,997
We give thanks for being alive,

449
00:46:24,092 --> 00:46:26,667
and pray that in your mercy...

450
00:46:28,223 --> 00:46:31,344
Snake, it's me - Taslima.

451
00:46:33,272 --> 00:46:36,773
I'm coming with you
to Cuervo's place. Yeah?

452
00:46:39,031 --> 00:46:40,858
They're new.

453
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:43,110
They don't belong to any gang.

454
00:46:43,204 --> 00:46:45,244
They're just scared, that's all.

455
00:46:45,332 --> 00:46:48,334
That's how I was
when they first deported me.

456
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:52,122
- Why are you here?
- I was a Muslim in South Dakota.

457
00:46:52,217 --> 00:46:54,341
Suddenly they made it a crime.

458
00:46:54,429 --> 00:46:57,764
I mean, why stay?
You can go south - Mexico.

459
00:46:57,850 --> 00:47:03,096
LA's still the place. What's happened
on the other side of the world...

460
00:47:03,192 --> 00:47:05,232
That's the prison.

461
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:08,821
This is the only
free zone left... anywhere.

462
00:47:11,996 --> 00:47:13,906
Dark paradise.

463
00:47:13,999 --> 00:47:16,373
At least we get something.

464
00:47:17,546 --> 00:47:22,887
A girl can still wear a fur coat
if she wants to, for example.

465
00:47:22,971 --> 00:47:26,057
No, no, once you
figure out this place,

466
00:47:26,142 --> 00:47:28,931
it's really not so bad.

467
00:47:30,023 --> 00:47:32,064
Get down!

468
00:47:47,883 --> 00:47:50,422
Where's it coming from?

469
00:47:50,512 --> 00:47:53,431
The car in the street below!

470
00:48:31,573 --> 00:48:34,243
Hop in, Snake. Come on.

471
00:48:38,875 --> 00:48:42,661
Nobody ever gets out
of Beverly Hills alive.

472
00:48:42,756 --> 00:48:47,669
- That's why you let me go there.
- You need one of my maps.

473
00:48:49,891 --> 00:48:53,013
Listen to me, Snake.
I got connections here.

474
00:48:53,105 --> 00:48:56,475
You can't just walk around
without knowing the ropes.

475
00:48:56,568 --> 00:48:58,775
Take the wrong street, you're dead.

476
00:48:58,863 --> 00:49:00,607
Stop the car.

477
00:49:00,699 --> 00:49:03,370
All right, anything you say.

478
00:49:03,453 --> 00:49:06,871
Although I was going to take you
to Cuervo Jones' place.

479
00:49:06,958 --> 00:49:10,459
- Where is it?
- Right over there.

480
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:22,890
It's pretty neat, huh?
It's Cuervo's car. He lets me use it.

481
00:49:22,982 --> 00:49:26,649
Don't worry, you've just
been shot with a fun gun.

482
00:49:26,738 --> 00:49:28,612
Feel it? You feel it?

483
00:49:28,699 --> 00:49:31,654
It's pure mesh, man.
100-proof artery choker.

484
00:49:31,745 --> 00:49:36,540
When the hit pulls you an inch
from death, that is living.

485
00:49:36,627 --> 00:49:40,461
I'm actually Cuervo's agent,
I'd love to represent you too.

486
00:49:40,550 --> 00:49:43,755
We could make a bundle.
Help your career.

487
00:49:43,846 --> 00:49:47,383
Last couple of years,
it's like you've disappeared...

488
00:49:49,313 --> 00:49:52,351
I know what the cops sent him to do.

489
00:49:52,442 --> 00:49:56,905
Plissken was the second rescue team,
looking for the box and the girl.

490
00:49:56,991 --> 00:50:02,580
All I'm asking for is a finder's fee.
Maybe Wisconsin. I don't know.

491
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:05,752
- We're almost set up, Cuervo.
- Good.

492
00:50:07,924 --> 00:50:13,513
I originally heard about this
when I was working for NASA.

493
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:18,809
Common, ordinary remote-control unit.
Yeah? Everyone's got one, right?

494
00:50:18,898 --> 00:50:21,569
Here's the kicker.

495
00:50:21,652 --> 00:50:26,317
This instruction disk hooks you
into the Sword of Damocles,

496
00:50:26,410 --> 00:50:28,569
the ultimate defensive weapon system.

497
00:50:32,168 --> 00:50:33,996
You see that?

498
00:50:34,088 --> 00:50:36,758
A ring of satellites
encircling the earth.

499
00:50:36,842 --> 00:50:41,173
Attached to each satellite
is a mega neutron bomb.

500
00:50:41,265 --> 00:50:43,757
When detonated, each satellite

501
00:50:43,852 --> 00:50:46,605
unleashes an intense
electromagnetic pulse,

502
00:50:46,690 --> 00:50:49,098
but EMP doesn't harm a living thing.

503
00:50:49,193 --> 00:50:54,403
But it does shut down every known
power source, all electrical devices,

504
00:50:54,493 --> 00:50:56,866
cars, aeroplanes, toasters,

505
00:50:56,955 --> 00:50:59,529
computers, everything...
even batteries.

506
00:50:59,625 --> 00:51:05,168
But this... makes this
an aiming device

507
00:51:05,259 --> 00:51:09,128
that gives the user
incredible accuracy.

508
00:51:09,223 --> 00:51:13,009
You can pinpoint precisely
what you want to shut down.

509
00:51:13,104 --> 00:51:17,483
A taxi cab in Buenos Aires,
the entire country of Spain. Amazing.

510
00:51:17,569 --> 00:51:20,571
You could shut down the whole planet,

511
00:51:20,657 --> 00:51:23,327
send it right back to the Dark Ages.

512
00:51:24,412 --> 00:51:26,406
- He's dead.
- I agree.

513
00:51:26,499 --> 00:51:30,415
Plissken's been dead before,
but he never stays down.

514
00:51:30,505 --> 00:51:32,545
The mission's scrubbed, Commander.

515
00:51:32,633 --> 00:51:35,920
I shouldn't have let you
talk me out of that air strike.

516
00:51:36,013 --> 00:51:41,092
Well, it's on now, effective
immediately. Full-scale.

517
00:51:41,187 --> 00:51:44,106
Target Los Angeles.
Flatten it. Burn it.

518
00:51:44,192 --> 00:51:45,307
No!

519
00:51:48,698 --> 00:51:50,656
What did you say?

520
00:51:50,743 --> 00:51:54,410
Cuervo Jones is holding
all the cards now, sir.

521
00:51:54,498 --> 00:51:57,869
He sees our aircraft,
he pushes that button... kaboom!

522
00:51:57,962 --> 00:52:01,415
There goes our aircraft
AND the United States.

523
00:52:02,552 --> 00:52:07,263
We don't even know if he knows
how to work the goddam thing.

524
00:52:07,351 --> 00:52:10,270
Snake Plissken, American outlaw.

525
00:52:10,355 --> 00:52:12,183
You'll like this.

526
00:52:13,652 --> 00:52:17,948
Remember, Cuevo, you've got to punch
in the world code first - 666.

527
00:52:18,033 --> 00:52:20,989
That brings all
the satellites on line.

528
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:23,750
Eh, pendejo, you think I'm stupid?

529
00:52:23,834 --> 00:52:26,373
No. No. No. I'm sorry, Cuervo.

530
00:52:26,463 --> 00:52:28,255
Bring them in.

531
00:52:32,012 --> 00:52:34,053
OK, OK, go on.

532
00:52:36,310 --> 00:52:40,642
'Hello, North America.
Buenas noches, Sud America.

533
00:52:40,734 --> 00:52:45,279
Yes, I am Cuervo Jones...

534
00:52:45,366 --> 00:52:47,158
Wait a minute.

535
00:52:47,243 --> 00:52:48,786
That's Plissken.

536
00:52:48,871 --> 00:52:52,740
This is LA, people without
hope or a country.

537
00:52:52,835 --> 00:52:54,579
I knew it. He's alive.

538
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:58,291
You know what they want-liberation.

539
00:52:58,385 --> 00:53:00,794
Now it's their turn.

540
00:53:00,889 --> 00:53:03,807
I am taking over with this.

541
00:53:05,854 --> 00:53:09,272
I told you not to try
to get this back, didn't I?

542
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:12,730
But you disobeyed me. Well...

543
00:53:13,908 --> 00:53:16,151
He's entering the target code.

544
00:53:16,245 --> 00:53:19,164
Bend over, Mr President.

545
00:53:19,249 --> 00:53:21,492
Time for a spanking.

546
00:53:21,586 --> 00:53:25,206
He's targeting Lynchburg.
That'll shut down the capital.

547
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:27,210
Get me the White House.

548
00:53:27,303 --> 00:53:31,801
- This broadcast is live...
- Get me my wife, please.

549
00:53:31,893 --> 00:53:35,394
- Are you watching TV?
- Yes, I'm watching it.

550
00:53:35,482 --> 00:53:37,060
Yes, I know.

551
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:38,646
Curfew.

552
00:53:38,736 --> 00:53:41,822
Hello? Hello?

553
00:53:41,908 --> 00:53:44,067
Hey, Presidente,

554
00:53:44,161 --> 00:53:46,238
silence is golden, no?

555
00:53:46,331 --> 00:53:50,461
Don't tell me you didn't
enjoy this just a little bit.

556
00:53:50,546 --> 00:53:53,833
I mean, if your wife's
anything like your daughter,

557
00:53:53,926 --> 00:53:57,261
she's sweet,
but you just can't shut her up.

558
00:53:57,347 --> 00:53:59,507
Knock it off, Cuervo.

559
00:53:59,601 --> 00:54:01,844
All right, now this is set.

560
00:54:01,937 --> 00:54:05,860
We shut down
the entire United States.

561
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:10,358
I want a police chopper to come
and get me at the Happy Kingdom,

562
00:54:10,450 --> 00:54:12,491
no later than 5am.

563
00:54:12,578 --> 00:54:17,207
Once I'm airborne,
you'll get your orders.

564
00:54:17,294 --> 00:54:22,587
Remember, don't piss me off,
or I'll... pull the plug.

565
00:54:23,344 --> 00:54:26,465
I'm at the mercy of this madman.

566
00:54:26,557 --> 00:54:28,800
Don't count Plissken out, sir.

567
00:54:28,894 --> 00:54:31,433
He's tanked. He's a POW.

568
00:54:31,523 --> 00:54:32,722
But he's still alive.

569
00:55:52,184 --> 00:55:57,478
Six, five, four, three, two, one!

570
00:56:01,698 --> 00:56:03,906
Shot clock!

571
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:25,933
Get him. Get him up.

572
00:56:33,955 --> 00:56:35,865
But this is insane.

573
00:56:35,957 --> 00:56:38,960
It is. That's the point.

574
00:56:59,492 --> 00:57:01,735
All right, all right.

575
00:57:10,717 --> 00:57:14,005
I promised you tonight
was going to be special.

576
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:20,103
I also promised one last spectacle
of death in this historic arena.

577
00:57:20,190 --> 00:57:22,896
Now you will see that death.

578
00:57:22,986 --> 00:57:25,359
I give you...

579
00:57:25,448 --> 00:57:31,370
the death of Snake Plissken!

580
00:57:47,731 --> 00:57:50,305
Some people think
you're already dead, Snake.

581
00:57:50,401 --> 00:57:52,691
Some say you never will be.

582
00:57:52,780 --> 00:57:55,319
You may have survived Cleveland,

583
00:57:55,409 --> 00:57:58,660
you may have
escaped from New York,

584
00:57:58,747 --> 00:58:00,906
but this is LA, vato.

585
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:07,124
And you're about to find out that
this fucking city can kill anybody!

586
00:58:07,218 --> 00:58:09,461
LA! LA!

587
00:58:25,411 --> 00:58:28,034
Game time!

588
00:58:33,382 --> 00:58:35,126
Basketball.

589
00:58:35,218 --> 00:58:38,719
Two hoops. Full court.
10-second shot clock.

590
00:58:38,806 --> 00:58:40,599
Miss a shot-get shot.

591
00:58:40,684 --> 00:58:43,889
Buzzer goes off
before you shoot-get shot.

592
00:58:43,981 --> 00:58:46,936
Two points for a basket.
No three-point bullshit.

593
00:58:47,027 --> 00:58:51,240
All you got to do is make
10 points. That's it.

594
00:58:54,413 --> 00:58:55,824
By the way,

595
00:58:55,915 --> 00:58:59,997
nobody's ever walked
off that court alive.

596
00:59:00,088 --> 00:59:01,832
Nobody.

597
00:59:07,933 --> 00:59:09,476
All right!

598
00:59:26,377 --> 00:59:29,130
Six, five, four...

599
00:59:29,214 --> 00:59:30,875
three, two,

600
00:59:30,967 --> 00:59:32,248
one!

601
00:59:40,147 --> 00:59:42,639
Five, four...

602
00:59:42,734 --> 00:59:45,405
three, two, one!

603
00:59:55,128 --> 00:59:57,798
- Nice shot.
- He's getting tired now.

604
00:59:57,882 --> 01:00:01,549
Four, three, two, one!

605
01:01:04,731 --> 01:01:06,606
This town loves a winner.

606
01:01:16,665 --> 01:01:18,706
He won, Cuervo.

607
01:01:22,591 --> 01:01:25,796
- You can't kill him.
- I have to.

608
01:01:33,148 --> 01:01:34,773
Get off!

609
01:01:41,577 --> 01:01:43,120
It's the big one!

610
01:01:55,139 --> 01:01:57,049
Find him!

611
01:01:57,142 --> 01:01:58,554
We're going to Anaheim.

612
01:01:58,644 --> 01:01:59,641
Come here.

613
01:02:01,565 --> 01:02:05,647
Cuervo. Cuervo, wait up.
Give me a minute!

614
01:02:05,738 --> 01:02:09,275
- Get lost, agent!
- We got a relationship here, man.

615
01:02:09,369 --> 01:02:11,409
Let me make something clear.

616
01:02:11,497 --> 01:02:14,582
I'm getting irritated,
and that's not good.

617
01:02:14,668 --> 01:02:19,083
Irritated with me? Cuervo, I'm
taking care of you, understand?

618
01:02:19,175 --> 01:02:22,510
- We can't find him, Cuervo.
- Keep looking!

619
01:02:31,151 --> 01:02:33,191
Get in the car.

620
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:39,784
If I'm being too rough on you,
just let me know.

621
01:03:23,604 --> 01:03:27,188
Snake, don't shoot. It's me - Utopia.

622
01:03:27,276 --> 01:03:29,566
I'm alone.

623
01:03:29,654 --> 01:03:32,146
This whole place is a nightmare.

624
01:03:34,119 --> 01:03:36,160
Cuervo's a killer.

625
01:03:36,247 --> 01:03:38,324
He's worse than my father.

626
01:03:38,417 --> 01:03:41,870
I want to go back with you.

627
01:03:46,846 --> 01:03:48,887
Oh, my God.

628
01:03:48,975 --> 01:03:52,476
My father sent you
to kill me, didn't he?

629
01:03:57,612 --> 01:03:59,522
Shut up.

630
01:03:59,615 --> 01:04:01,525
Get out of here.

631
01:04:03,621 --> 01:04:05,116
Go.

632
01:04:05,207 --> 01:04:08,578
Wait. You can't
take that back, Snake.

633
01:04:08,670 --> 01:04:11,542
Oh, God.
You can't give that to him.

634
01:04:11,633 --> 01:04:15,300
He wants to control everything,
just like Cuervo.

635
01:04:15,389 --> 01:04:18,806
If I don't take it back, I'm dead.

636
01:04:23,985 --> 01:04:25,314
Another one?

637
01:04:40,009 --> 01:04:41,124
Run!

638
01:04:52,652 --> 01:04:54,278
It's over.

639
01:04:54,363 --> 01:04:57,449
Get me a damage report
as soon as possible.

640
01:04:57,535 --> 01:04:59,113
Yes, sir.

641
01:04:59,204 --> 01:05:01,530
Oh, thank God almighty.

642
01:05:01,624 --> 01:05:06,537
Maybe that's the answer
to all of our problems.

643
01:05:06,631 --> 01:05:10,548
Maybe... maybe they're all dead.

644
01:05:10,637 --> 01:05:12,512
Maybe.

645
01:05:14,643 --> 01:05:18,513
Oh, Cuervo, man!
We almost bought the farm.

646
01:05:18,607 --> 01:05:21,396
The whole place
just fell in right behind us.

647
01:05:22,655 --> 01:05:24,696
Where is Plissken?

648
01:05:24,783 --> 01:05:29,163
He's down there. He's dead.
He's history, and I did it.

649
01:05:29,248 --> 01:05:31,158
I killed him. I shot him.

650
01:05:31,251 --> 01:05:33,292
Right? Tell him.

651
01:05:36,718 --> 01:05:38,545
Give it to me.

652
01:05:38,637 --> 01:05:42,174
Oh, yeah. I brought it
back to you, Cuervo.

653
01:05:42,268 --> 01:05:44,308
It's all there.

654
01:05:57,039 --> 01:06:00,375
Whoa, dude, is that you, Snake?

655
01:06:00,461 --> 01:06:02,585
Far out, man.

656
01:06:02,673 --> 01:06:05,545
Hey, did you find Cuervo, man?

657
01:06:05,636 --> 01:06:08,210
Hey, Cuervo, wait.
I've done it all, man.

658
01:06:08,306 --> 01:06:12,306
I killed Plissken.
I got your girl back for you...

659
01:06:12,396 --> 01:06:13,807
So where is he?

660
01:06:13,898 --> 01:06:16,141
I shot him.

661
01:06:16,235 --> 01:06:18,193
He went down, OK?

662
01:06:18,279 --> 01:06:21,566
His body's probably in
Wilshire Canyon somewhere.

663
01:06:21,659 --> 01:06:24,578
Good! So then you know where he is.

664
01:06:24,664 --> 01:06:26,704
Bring me his head.

665
01:06:31,632 --> 01:06:34,884
- Where's the Happy Kingdom?
- Anaheim. The invasion staging area.

666
01:06:34,971 --> 01:06:37,379
Everyone's gonna be there,
except me.

667
01:06:37,474 --> 01:06:41,973
I'm staying here, man,
I'm ready for the big wave.

668
01:06:42,065 --> 01:06:44,224
- Take me there.
- What?

669
01:06:44,318 --> 01:06:45,433
Take me there.

670
01:06:45,528 --> 01:06:48,281
You're not well, Snake.
You need help.

671
01:06:48,366 --> 01:06:50,359
Hold on.

672
01:06:50,452 --> 01:06:53,620
- Who shot you?
- It doesn't matter.

673
01:06:53,707 --> 01:06:55,202
Yeah, you're right.

674
01:06:55,292 --> 01:06:57,582
Talk to Hershe.
She hates Cuervo.

675
01:06:57,671 --> 01:07:01,089
They used to be partners,
and they split up.

676
01:07:01,176 --> 01:07:03,799
- Who?
- Hershe.

677
01:07:03,889 --> 01:07:07,591
She lives in a big boat.
Hangs with Saigon Shadow.

678
01:07:07,686 --> 01:07:10,308
Man, they don't take shit
from nobody.

679
01:07:10,398 --> 01:07:12,890
What is that?

680
01:07:12,985 --> 01:07:15,228
Tsunami, Snake. Tsunami! Woo!

681
01:07:15,322 --> 01:07:18,609
Surf's up big-time now,
mister. Ha ha!

682
01:07:18,702 --> 01:07:23,616
Start feeling better quick, man,
cos you ain't got time to escape.

683
01:07:23,710 --> 01:07:27,376
This is going to be some ride, man,
some kind of bitchin' ride.

684
01:07:27,465 --> 01:07:29,589
Let's go. Come on.

685
01:07:29,677 --> 01:07:32,216
Bitchin', man.

686
01:07:34,100 --> 01:07:38,848
Let the front edge pick you up. Don't
get on till you ride to the top.

687
01:07:38,941 --> 01:07:44,567
Don't blow it, man. If you fall off,
it's the big wipe-out. Got it?

688
01:07:44,657 --> 01:07:46,865
Whoo! Bitchin'.

689
01:07:47,370 --> 01:07:49,410
Hang on, Snake.

690
01:08:15,161 --> 01:08:17,368
You got to be kidding me.

691
01:08:20,961 --> 01:08:22,670
Later.

692
01:08:22,755 --> 01:08:24,714
Ooh, Snake!

693
01:09:19,381 --> 01:09:22,918
Tell me how to get downtown -
somebody named Hershe.

694
01:09:23,012 --> 01:09:25,800
- Sure, Snake. No problem.
- Hey, hey!

695
01:09:25,891 --> 01:09:28,430
Are you going to kill me?

696
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:30,228
Hershe.

697
01:09:30,314 --> 01:09:33,067
Right. Keep straight.
Two blocks down, right.

698
01:09:43,375 --> 01:09:47,161
Warning.
Neurosystem shut-down. One hour.

699
01:10:06,826 --> 01:10:09,698
I first met Hershe
when I got deported.

700
01:10:09,789 --> 01:10:13,326
She helped set me up.
We're talking a power player.

701
01:10:13,420 --> 01:10:18,713
Cuervo's got numbers and firepower,
but Hershe's got big-time ambitions.

702
01:10:18,803 --> 01:10:23,633
The two of you hooked up together,
I'm talking box-office material.

703
01:10:23,727 --> 01:10:25,554
What?

704
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:31,689
Easy, Snake. I see him, too.
We're OK. Come on.

705
01:10:31,780 --> 01:10:35,067
She's going to love you, Snake.
You'll love her, too.

706
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:37,320
We'll make this thing happen.

707
01:10:37,413 --> 01:10:41,330
I'm through with Cuervo. The guy's
got no sense of loyalty whatsoever.

708
01:10:41,419 --> 01:10:42,416
Through here.

709
01:10:44,174 --> 01:10:45,337
What?

710
01:10:45,425 --> 01:10:48,048
How you doin'? Long time, no see.

711
01:10:48,138 --> 01:10:50,712
Remember me? Map To The Stars Eddie.

712
01:10:50,808 --> 01:10:53,764
I got somebody I want Hershe to meet,

713
01:10:53,855 --> 01:10:56,940
Snake Plissken,
right here in the flesh.

714
01:10:58,027 --> 01:11:00,068
Your gun.

715
01:11:00,156 --> 01:11:02,196
Great. Thanks, pal.

716
01:11:06,415 --> 01:11:10,794
All right, we're in. Strange scene
here. Let me do the talking.

717
01:11:17,848 --> 01:11:20,175
Hey, Hershe, how you doin'?

718
01:11:20,269 --> 01:11:23,686
Hang on, guys. This is big.
It's Snake Plissken.

719
01:11:23,774 --> 01:11:27,358
I brought him to see you, Hershe.
He's got a business proposition.

720
01:11:27,446 --> 01:11:31,148
- What's in it for me?
- Wait a minute.

721
01:11:33,956 --> 01:11:35,783
I know that voice.

722
01:11:37,836 --> 01:11:40,755
Yeah... You're Carjack Malone.

723
01:11:40,841 --> 01:11:43,333
Not any more.

724
01:11:43,428 --> 01:11:45,801
You two know each other?

725
01:11:52,483 --> 01:11:57,278
The more things change, the more
they stay the same, huh, Carjack?

726
01:11:57,365 --> 01:12:00,036
Still packing a gun
between your legs.

727
01:12:00,119 --> 01:12:02,160
Hold on, honey...

728
01:12:02,248 --> 01:12:04,325
You bolted on me in Cleveland.

729
01:12:04,417 --> 01:12:06,078
Hershe, you were in Cleveland?

730
01:12:06,170 --> 01:12:10,336
With me and Texas Mike O'Shea.
You looked different then, Carjack.

731
01:12:10,426 --> 01:12:13,963
Get one thing straight.
I'm no longer Carjack Malone.

732
01:12:14,057 --> 01:12:18,008
I'm Hershe Las Palmas,
the most drop-dead number.

733
01:12:18,104 --> 01:12:20,727
What the hell happened in Cleveland?

734
01:12:20,817 --> 01:12:23,938
- I got caught and you didn't!
- Don't lie to me!

735
01:12:24,030 --> 01:12:28,361
So I made another deal! I've
been here five years, not you!

736
01:12:28,453 --> 01:12:32,038
I got a new deal.
You help me, you live.

737
01:12:32,125 --> 01:12:34,166
I wouldn't do that, Snake.

738
01:12:34,253 --> 01:12:37,125
See, anything happens to me,
and you're dead.

739
01:12:37,216 --> 01:12:39,791
I'm already dead.

740
01:12:40,262 --> 01:12:42,755
I see your point. What's the deal?

741
01:12:42,849 --> 01:12:45,389
Get me to Cuervo Jones.
I got one hour.

742
01:12:45,478 --> 01:12:47,306
Dream on, blue eye.

743
01:12:47,398 --> 01:12:49,273
Say good night, Carjack.

744
01:12:49,359 --> 01:12:53,774
Cuervo's got firepower.
No one gets near him.

745
01:12:53,866 --> 01:12:56,785
And he's got the black box
and the girl.

746
01:12:56,870 --> 01:13:00,288
- What black box?
- That shuts down the power.

747
01:13:00,375 --> 01:13:05,372
Oh, yeah, right! And the Plutoxin
Seven virus kills you in ten hours.

748
01:13:05,466 --> 01:13:07,424
- What?
- It's bullshit!

749
01:13:07,511 --> 01:13:10,798
Rumour control. Government
propaganda. Just one more lie.

750
01:13:10,891 --> 01:13:14,392
It's true. I represented
the guy who invented it.

751
01:13:15,940 --> 01:13:18,267
Swear to God, Snake.

752
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:20,153
What's the deal, gorgeous?

753
01:13:20,238 --> 01:13:22,398
Get the girl and the box,
and get out.

754
01:13:22,492 --> 01:13:24,532
All of us?

755
01:13:25,913 --> 01:13:28,750
- Yeah.
- Me, too?

756
01:13:28,834 --> 01:13:30,792
Why should we leave?

757
01:13:30,879 --> 01:13:33,288
I love LA.

758
01:13:33,383 --> 01:13:35,376
Where we gonna go?

759
01:13:35,469 --> 01:13:37,427
What's the big payoff?

760
01:13:37,514 --> 01:13:40,220
A million dollars
for whoever helps me.

761
01:13:40,310 --> 01:13:44,096
A million greenbacks?
I got ten million the next room.

762
01:13:44,190 --> 01:13:47,062
Uh-uh. Bluebacks.

763
01:13:47,153 --> 01:13:50,321
- Come on, Snake.
- Swear to God, Eddie.

764
01:13:51,409 --> 01:13:53,652
This is bigger than Cleveland.

765
01:13:53,746 --> 01:13:55,870
It sounds thin to me.

766
01:13:55,958 --> 01:13:58,794
You want Cuervo to rule the world?

767
01:13:58,879 --> 01:14:02,296
No. That sucks.
So how do we get out?

768
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:05,430
I'll tell you that when we get there.

769
01:14:05,514 --> 01:14:08,433
Oh, Plissken, man,
you are such a loser!

770
01:14:08,518 --> 01:14:10,845
Making up shit along the way.

771
01:14:10,938 --> 01:14:13,478
That's why I left you in Cleveland.

772
01:14:13,567 --> 01:14:17,649
You're just a chump
like the rest of us. No deal!

773
01:14:17,740 --> 01:14:20,826
Government chopper. It'll be there.

774
01:14:20,912 --> 01:14:25,410
OK, that's better. How are we
getting there in an hour?

775
01:14:25,502 --> 01:14:27,542
That's your end.

776
01:14:31,427 --> 01:14:32,839
Edward.

777
01:14:32,929 --> 01:14:35,848
Best you could do is take the five.

778
01:14:35,934 --> 01:14:38,853
The shape it's in,
two and a half hours minimum.

779
01:14:38,938 --> 01:14:41,857
No. Use the air. They're burning.

780
01:14:41,943 --> 01:14:45,313
The Santa Anas. The night wind.

781
01:14:45,406 --> 01:14:48,859
- What are you talking about?
- Death from above.

782
01:15:09,191 --> 01:15:11,434
I don't know about this.

783
01:15:11,528 --> 01:15:14,021
You don't like it, don't come.

784
01:15:14,115 --> 01:15:16,405
Where'd you get these rigs, Carjack?

785
01:15:16,494 --> 01:15:19,200
My name is Hershe.
Understand, Plissken?

786
01:15:19,290 --> 01:15:21,367
I got an idea.

787
01:15:19,460 --> 01:15:21,500
Got any red nail polish?

788
01:15:21,588 --> 01:15:23,712
- What?
- Come on.

789
01:15:28,097 --> 01:15:30,804
I expect that back, Eddie.

790
01:15:36,151 --> 01:15:40,862
There. Looks just like the Sword
of Damocles instruction CD.

791
01:15:40,950 --> 01:15:43,869
Maybe we can pull a Texas switch.

792
01:15:43,954 --> 01:15:47,407
- If you get close enough.
- Don't worry.

793
01:15:48,252 --> 01:15:50,542
The wind's up. Let's go!

794
01:16:12,789 --> 01:16:13,785
Shut-down - 34 minutes.

795
01:17:04,616 --> 01:17:07,404
Are you ready for the new world?

796
01:17:10,958 --> 01:17:13,961
The attack is now under way!

797
01:17:39,793 --> 01:17:42,961
- What's going on?
- We're fucked!

798
01:17:53,772 --> 01:17:55,812
You see Plissken anywhere?

799
01:17:58,320 --> 01:18:00,812
Shut-down - 25 minutes.

800
01:18:08,377 --> 01:18:11,830
Get my jet ready.
Get it fuelled ready to go.

801
01:18:14,052 --> 01:18:16,723
You can't run away. It's too late.

802
01:18:16,806 --> 01:18:19,477
You have to stand and face it down.

803
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:21,019
Mr President.

804
01:18:21,104 --> 01:18:23,561
Commander, we're receiving reports.

805
01:18:23,649 --> 01:18:26,521
An armada of warships
has departed Cuba,

806
01:18:26,612 --> 01:18:28,653
ETA, Florida in 45 minutes.

807
01:18:28,740 --> 01:18:30,781
They're starting the invasion.

808
01:18:31,661 --> 01:18:33,869
I'm going to my quarters!

809
01:18:33,956 --> 01:18:35,997
I've got to pray!

810
01:18:37,044 --> 01:18:40,664
Go with him. Make sure
he doesn't do anything crazy.

811
01:18:55,405 --> 01:18:58,941
Hey, Eddie, is that
what I think it is?

812
01:18:59,035 --> 01:19:03,581
Yeah. It kept changing owners.
Finally went bankrupt.

813
01:19:03,667 --> 01:19:05,708
That thing in Paris killed them.

814
01:19:05,795 --> 01:19:07,836
We need a diversion.

815
01:19:13,056 --> 01:19:15,215
Hey, Cuervo! Hey!

816
01:19:16,979 --> 01:19:19,649
Hey, Cuervo! I made it!

817
01:19:19,733 --> 01:19:22,569
I made it! Wait for me! Whoa!

818
01:19:24,114 --> 01:19:26,155
Oh, shit!

819
01:19:34,087 --> 01:19:36,247
Hey, Cuervo!

820
01:19:36,341 --> 01:19:38,583
Will you please kill him for me?

821
01:19:38,677 --> 01:19:42,547
Hey! Hey! I got news!
There's about to be an attack!

822
01:19:42,642 --> 01:19:46,059
You're about to get hit, man.
It's Plissken.

823
01:19:48,650 --> 01:19:50,977
You told me you shot him dead.

824
01:19:51,071 --> 01:19:53,195
Yeah, I thought I did,

825
01:19:53,282 --> 01:19:56,487
but I found him... sort of... alive.

826
01:19:56,579 --> 01:19:58,619
Sort of. Where?

827
01:19:59,667 --> 01:20:01,957
- Oh, Cuervo.
- What?

828
01:20:02,045 --> 01:20:05,712
- It's so good to see you.
- Where is Plissken?!

829
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:09,088
- He's near.
- You're stalling, Eddie.

830
01:20:09,181 --> 01:20:10,925
Aah! Jeez!

831
01:20:11,017 --> 01:20:14,518
Talk, gringo,
or I'll rip your balls off.

832
01:20:14,606 --> 01:20:16,646
Look out behind you!

833
01:20:33,133 --> 01:20:37,263
You have lied to me
for the very last time.

834
01:23:27,934 --> 01:23:30,307
Come on, hurry up! Let's go!

835
01:23:38,700 --> 01:23:41,786
Get inside the chopper.
It's bulletproof.

836
01:23:46,795 --> 01:23:49,501
I'll take my coat back now, asshole.

837
01:24:07,826 --> 01:24:10,366
- Take me back.
- Secure the latch.

838
01:24:13,502 --> 01:24:15,542
You got the remote. Great.

839
01:24:15,630 --> 01:24:17,754
Yeah. Give me the real one.

840
01:24:17,841 --> 01:24:19,882
I didn't make a switch.

841
01:24:19,969 --> 01:24:22,093
Yes, you did. I saw you.

842
01:24:23,934 --> 01:24:25,974
Give me that gun!

843
01:24:55,230 --> 01:24:58,850
Damn it. Carjack, we're hooked up
on your side.

844
01:25:29,573 --> 01:25:31,816
I hit him!

845
01:25:56,863 --> 01:25:58,275
Get back here, Plissken!

846
01:26:00,076 --> 01:26:01,986
Aircraft entering quadrant four, sir.

847
01:26:02,079 --> 01:26:05,664
- I'm getting radio contact.
- Boost it.

848
01:26:05,751 --> 01:26:08,244
Get the antidote ready, assholes!

849
01:26:08,338 --> 01:26:10,546
Plissken, do you have the box?

850
01:26:10,634 --> 01:26:13,838
I got the remote control unit
and instruction disk.

851
01:26:13,930 --> 01:26:16,220
Get the trucks, we're on fire.

852
01:26:16,309 --> 01:26:19,893
Shut-down, two minutes, 27 seconds.

853
01:26:19,981 --> 01:26:23,731
All emergency vehicles,
proceed to the north perimeter.

854
01:26:30,496 --> 01:26:32,823
Shit! Shit!

855
01:26:38,216 --> 01:26:40,459
This is a full alert.

856
01:26:43,182 --> 01:26:45,674
Where the hell is he going?

857
01:26:46,270 --> 01:26:48,310
Get ready to jump.

858
01:26:48,398 --> 01:26:51,186
Head for the tree line and disappear.

859
01:26:52,738 --> 01:26:53,734
Go.

860
01:26:53,823 --> 01:26:55,733
Go!

861
01:27:58,836 --> 01:28:00,794
Oh, thank God almighty!

862
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:02,708
Thank God almighty!

863
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:04,710
Welcome back, sir.

864
01:28:04,803 --> 01:28:06,843
Give me the goddam shot.

865
01:28:14,359 --> 01:28:19,438
Your countdown clock has now
terminated function. Your time is up.

866
01:28:21,369 --> 01:28:24,407
I told you he was dumb.

867
01:28:24,499 --> 01:28:26,539
You took the fake, hotshot.

868
01:28:26,627 --> 01:28:30,543
Plutoxin Seven is a fast,
hard-hitting case of the flu.

869
01:28:31,759 --> 01:28:33,587
Pretty good.

870
01:28:33,679 --> 01:28:35,222
Relax, war hero.

871
01:28:35,306 --> 01:28:39,472
We took you for a little ride,
and you came through.

872
01:28:39,563 --> 01:28:42,316
Now, give me that unit.

873
01:28:51,372 --> 01:28:53,412
You want this thing?

874
01:28:53,834 --> 01:28:55,874
Come and get it.

875
01:28:57,381 --> 01:29:00,300
- Sir...
- What can he do?

876
01:29:00,385 --> 01:29:03,138
Let go of me! Quit it!

877
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:13,153
You didn't finish the mission, Snake.

878
01:29:13,238 --> 01:29:16,822
Looks like I'll have
to do it for you.

879
01:29:24,379 --> 01:29:26,420
Hold it, Mr President.

880
01:29:44,409 --> 01:29:46,237
Shit.

881
01:29:51,419 --> 01:29:53,460
We'll take this one.

882
01:30:04,522 --> 01:30:06,563
Get her out of here.

883
01:30:06,650 --> 01:30:08,359
Daddy...

884
01:30:08,444 --> 01:30:10,901
Take her to the chair.

885
01:30:17,416 --> 01:30:20,869
For he so loved his country...

886
01:30:20,963 --> 01:30:24,548
he gave his only seditious child.

887
01:30:29,392 --> 01:30:31,433
Prepare to broadcast...

888
01:30:32,438 --> 01:30:34,479
worldwide.

889
01:30:35,860 --> 01:30:37,901
Worldwide!

890
01:30:39,449 --> 01:30:44,078
She didn't know that she had it
in her pocket, did she?

891
01:30:44,164 --> 01:30:48,745
I was wondering what kind of
lame switch you'd try to pull.

892
01:30:48,838 --> 01:30:50,962
You're becoming very predictable.

893
01:30:53,052 --> 01:30:55,093
Yeah, I guess so.

894
01:30:55,890 --> 01:30:57,930
You got a smoke?

895
01:30:58,018 --> 01:31:00,973
The United States
is a no-smoking nation.

896
01:31:01,064 --> 01:31:05,360
No smoking, no drinking, no drugs,
no women-unless you're married.

897
01:31:05,446 --> 01:31:08,947
No guns, no foul language,
no red meat.

898
01:31:09,034 --> 01:31:11,324
The land of the free.

899
01:31:15,127 --> 01:31:17,167
I don't need the teleprompter.

900
01:31:17,255 --> 01:31:20,957
This is the President
of the United States.

901
01:31:21,052 --> 01:31:25,550
I now demand an immediate
retreat of all forces

902
01:31:25,642 --> 01:31:28,395
now threatening
this great nation.

903
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:32,230
If my demand is not met immediately,

904
01:31:32,319 --> 01:31:37,743
I will destroy your ability
to function permanently.

905
01:31:37,827 --> 01:31:42,158
Mr President, the Cuban aggression
remains mobile. ETA, four minutes.

906
01:31:42,250 --> 01:31:43,793
Four minutes.

907
01:31:43,878 --> 01:31:48,423
Bring the aiming co-ordinates
for Cuba and Mexico online.

908
01:31:51,347 --> 01:31:54,136
Cuba-seven, seven, nine.

909
01:31:54,226 --> 01:31:56,979
Seven... seven...

910
01:31:57,064 --> 01:31:58,892
nine.

911
01:32:00,653 --> 01:32:04,948
I now render this final solution.

912
01:32:06,453 --> 01:32:09,989
Welcome to your own map to the stars.

913
01:32:10,083 --> 01:32:14,498
The big one wiped out
the entertainment industry in LA,

914
01:32:14,590 --> 01:32:17,960
but the glamour
of Hollywood is still alive...

915
01:32:18,053 --> 01:32:20,094
Very funny.

916
01:32:22,518 --> 01:32:24,892
I hope it was worth it,

917
01:32:24,980 --> 01:32:27,852
for now you are going to die.

918
01:32:27,943 --> 01:32:30,566
Everybody does.

919
01:32:30,655 --> 01:32:32,696
Kill him...

920
01:32:32,784 --> 01:32:36,450
and bring me the real unit.

921
01:32:36,539 --> 01:32:40,124
- Sir, we're still broadcasting.
- Good! Let them watch!

922
01:32:41,463 --> 01:32:43,291
Do it!

923
01:32:45,678 --> 01:32:46,923
Do it!

924
01:32:48,473 --> 01:32:50,016
On my command!

925
01:32:52,688 --> 01:32:54,147
Fire!

926
01:33:14,929 --> 01:33:18,300
He's not even here! He's a hologram!

927
01:33:20,062 --> 01:33:21,854
She catches on quick.

928
01:33:23,066 --> 01:33:27,446
Got to be within a half-mile radius.
Round up every available man.

929
01:33:27,531 --> 01:33:29,441
Hold it.

930
01:33:29,534 --> 01:33:33,451
Sir, the enemy is less than
two minutes from our shore.

931
01:33:33,540 --> 01:33:36,911
What's it to be, Plissken -
us or them?

932
01:33:38,548 --> 01:33:42,594
Shut down the Third World.
They lose, you win.

933
01:33:42,679 --> 01:33:45,005
Shut down America...

934
01:33:45,099 --> 01:33:47,556
you lose, they win.

935
01:33:47,645 --> 01:33:52,356
The more things change,
the more they stay the same.

936
01:33:52,443 --> 01:33:54,817
So what are you going to do?

937
01:33:54,905 --> 01:33:56,863
Disappear.

938
01:34:07,299 --> 01:34:09,339
He's entered the world code.

939
01:34:12,139 --> 01:34:14,216
No target code.

940
01:34:17,898 --> 01:34:21,066
Sir, that will shut down
the entire planet.

941
01:34:23,281 --> 01:34:26,698
I told you you'd better hope
I didn't make it back.

942
01:34:26,786 --> 01:34:32,245
You push that button, 500 years'
worth of work will be finished.

943
01:34:32,336 --> 01:34:36,585
Our technology, our way of life,
our entire history.

944
01:34:36,676 --> 01:34:39,594
We'll have to start all over again.

945
01:34:42,810 --> 01:34:45,682
For God's sakes, don't do it, Snake!

946
01:34:47,149 --> 01:34:49,309
The name's Plissken.

947
01:35:06,178 --> 01:35:07,838
He did it.

948
01:35:07,930 --> 01:35:10,505
He shut down the Earth.

949
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:31,171
Welcome to the human race.
