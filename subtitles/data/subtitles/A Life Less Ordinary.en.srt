A life Less Ordinary (1997) - 25fps

1
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,120
So, here's the deal.

2
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,040
We are in the garden, right?

3
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,920
And everything is great.

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,200
And there's this tree.

5
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,880
And the man says,
"See that tree?

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,800
"Don't eat the fruit
of that tree.

7
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,000
"That apple you do not eat."

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,960
He goes inside,
names some animals--

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,440
maybe takes a dump.

10
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,800
Anyway, what does she do?

11
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,360
She eats the apple!

12
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,040
I can't believe what I'm seeing!

13
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,920
He says, "Don't eat it!"
She eats it!

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,600
Unbelievable!

15
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,720
Since then, men, women--
I don't know.

16
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,120
It's all going wrong!

17
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,600
Divorce.

18
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,360
Miserable marriage.

19
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,200
Wedding canceled.

20
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,680
Remarried.

21
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,760
Divorced again.

22
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,680
Irreconcilable
sexual disharmony!

23
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,000
Dysfunctional marriage!

24
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,120
Divorce! Divorce!

25
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,200
Divorce! Divorce!
Divorce! Divorce!

26
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,760
Well?

27
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,920
Talk to me.

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,440
We had a bad run.

29
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,680
Things have changed down there.

30
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,760
Men and women
aren't like they used to be.

31
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,840
Well, things are
changing up here as well.

32
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,160
I'm getting pressure
from above...

33
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,280
if you know what I mean,
for results!

34
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,360
For men and women to be bonded
in eternal bliss.

35
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,440
In the meantime, I've been
instructed to introduce...

36
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,800
new incentive schemes
for our leading operatives.

37
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,280
Leading operatives, huh?

38
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,400
That's you.

39
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,440
Skip the flattery,
Gabriel. Where's the beef?

40
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,840
It's a hard case to crack.

41
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,880
I have full confidence
you can do it.

42
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,240
If you don't...

43
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,440
you don't come back.

44
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,360
What?

45
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,760
No way.

46
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,960
That's the new incentive scheme.

47
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,000
Your mission
is to unite man and woman...

48
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,520
blah, blah, blah, blah, OK?

49
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,120
When you're done...

50
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,440
you come back.

51
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,960
If you fail...

52
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,920
you stay down there forever.

53
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,840
You are not serious.

54
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,160
Liberatum mani.

55
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,360
It's out of my hands.

56
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,880
She's the secret daughter...

57
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,720
of Marilyn Monroe
and John F. Kennedy, right?

58
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,040
I mean, that's why Marilyn
was murdered.

59
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,920
So, the young girl
grows up in an orphanage...

60
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,160
unaware of
her incredible parentage.

61
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,440
Years go by.

62
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,600
She's beautiful.

63
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,160
She's smart.

64
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,840
She's successful, OK?

65
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,840
Then what?

66
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,280
Well, then...

67
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,280
Then she gets sent to London
as U.S. ambassador.

68
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,200
Where she discovers
who she is...

69
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,120
and also unravels
the secret of the Nazi gold...

70
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,320
hidden underneath the embassy.

71
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,400
Uh, yeah.

72
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,560
It's kind of obvious, Robert.

73
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,640
Of course it's obvious, guys.
It's a trash novel.

74
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,640
You buy it in the airport,
you take it on holiday.

75
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,640
Oh, Ms. Gesteten.

76
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,120
Nice to see you down here.

77
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,160
I'd love to stay and talk,
but, um, you know how things--

78
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,880
Nice trick, Celine.

79
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,520
-Want to try your luck?
-With the gun?

80
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,880
With the fruit.

81
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,240
I don't have time for games.

82
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,120
If you're afraid,
why don't you just say so?

83
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:12,200
Celine, last night,
we discussed a certain proposal.

84
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,800
And I said no,
because you cheat, Elliot.

85
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,000
OK.

86
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,760
So I'm flirtatious.

87
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,000
It's in my nature.

88
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,800
But I want you to think again.

89
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,800
Do you know how difficult
it is for a woman to find...

90
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,760
a good husband in this town?

91
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,720
Let alone a good dentist.

92
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,760
Celine...

93
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,760
I'm serious.

94
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,120
Robots?

95
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,280
You're telling us we're gonna be
replaced by robots?

96
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,600
That robots will get down on
their robot hands and knees...

97
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,360
and clean the dust out of
every office in this building?

98
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,080
I think not, Ms. Gesteten.

99
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:53,680
At least the robot won't spend
its time writing a trash novel.

100
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,360
Not even a very good
trash novel, as I understand it.

101
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,400
Oh, I see. This is personal.

102
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,600
This has nothing to do with me,
Robert.

103
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,360
This comes right from the top--
from Mr. Naville himself.

104
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,360
Perhaps it's time
I spoke to this Mr. Naville guy.

105
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,640
It's too late.

106
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,320
You're fired.

107
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,360
You ready?

108
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,160
Now, if you move...

109
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,960
the offer's canceled.

110
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,240
OK.

111
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,680
-Wait, Celine--
-Don't speak.

112
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,280
Do you think this is wise?

113
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,560
Puts me off.

114
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,040
Stop!

115
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,400
Mayhew...

116
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,920
Would you call a doctor?

117
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,720
It would be a pleasure, madam.

118
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,840
What are you doing here
this time of day?

119
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,960
Hi, Lily.

120
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,920
Well? Answer me.

121
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,440
Lily, I--I got fired.

122
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,280
They replaced me with a robot.

123
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,600
I know how they feel.

124
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,800
Hmm?

125
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,720
Look, I've been meaning
to tell you this...

126
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,240
for a while now, and...

127
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,800
seems like a good a time as any.

128
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:18,080
Robert...

129
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,760
I'm leaving you.

130
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,800
You're leaving?
What are you talking about?

131
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:26,160
His name is Ryan.
He teaches aerobics.

132
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,400
We're in love.
We're moving to Miami.

133
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,320
How can you do this?
At a time like this!

134
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,000
I want a man, not a dreamer.

135
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,200
I don't know what to say.
We could talk about this.

136
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,160
I'll get another job.
We'll sort everything out.

137
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,680
Sorry...

138
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,480
but as of tonight...

139
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,160
you're going home alone.

140
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,720
Uh...

141
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,240
Lily!

142
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,080
I'm leaving you.

143
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,880
You're fired.

144
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,840
It's kind of obvious, Robert.

145
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,520
He teaches aerobics.

146
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,880
We're in love.

147
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,720
We're moving to Miami.

148
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,720
Lily?

149
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,880
Lily?

150
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,880
Mr. Robert Lewis?

151
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,320
Yeah, that's me.

152
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,600
My name is Jackson.

153
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,520
This is my associate
Ms. O'Reilly.

154
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,520
We're from the Firm But Fair
Eviction & Collection Agency.

155
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,160
I have a list of certain items
we're empowered to collect...

156
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,880
under federal and state law...

157
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,320
in lieu of unpaid debts.

158
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,000
Furthermore, we are contracted
to serve upon you...

159
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,520
notice of eviction from these
here premises, uh, forthwith.

160
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,040
I beg your pardon?

161
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,600
We can do this
with violence or without.

162
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,880
It's up to you.

163
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:46,680
The client pays our
medical bills, but not yours.

164
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,760
Well?

165
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,320
Oh, without, please.

166
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,840
Good choice.

167
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,120
OK, let's go.

168
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,400
All right.

169
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,840
I can't believe this.

170
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,360
Do you have any idea...

171
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,680
how difficult it is to find
a good husband in this town?

172
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,840
Hmm?!

173
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,760
Or a good dentist, come to that?

174
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,840
Playing this sort of game...

175
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,200
you have disgraced yourself
once again.

176
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,520
You caught him
through the frontal lobe...

177
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,400
so apparently he'll live.

178
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,280
But he'll never practice
orthodontics again...

179
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,400
that's for sure.

180
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,680
Mr. Schneider,
call extension 487.

181
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,280
Mr. Schneider, 487.

182
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:46,200
My main fear is you're going
to end up like your mother...

183
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,400
who long ago found her own
natural level in society.

184
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,360
That is to say
she scuttles along the bottom.

185
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,640
Her biggest problem
was marrying a man like you--

186
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,280
a mistake I have taken
great care to avoid.

187
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,480
You...

188
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,520
are gonna go to work, my girl.

189
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,640
What?

190
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,520
You have spent
a quarter of a century...

191
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,000
watching the tide
go in and out...

192
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,120
but from tomorrow,
you are going to work...

193
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,920
here, under my supervision.

194
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,400
You're gonna learn
the essence of business...

195
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,640
about money and how it flows
relentlessly back...

196
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,600
towards he who owns it.

197
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,080
How to generate
a profit from a loss...

198
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,280
a loss from a profit.
You are gonna work.

199
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,800
This may not strike you
as very palatable.

200
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,920
Seven...

201
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,960
It may make you want to vomit.

202
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,520
But you will get used
to the taste.

203
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,120
And pretty soon,
you'll be spooning it down...

204
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:44,200
and asking for more
like all the other kids.

205
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,480
Eleven...

206
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,120
Mr. Naville, I presume?

207
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,560
Eleven...

208
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,480
You think you can
replace me with a robot?

209
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,920
Eleven...

210
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,720
Well, get this!

211
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,040
Eleven...

212
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,720
Twelve...

213
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,720
thirteen...

214
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,840
Fuck.

215
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,320
Fourteen...

216
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,560
Nobody fucking move!

217
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,040
Nobody fucking move!

218
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,520
Everyone on the floor!

219
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,680
Everyone!

220
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,200
Everyone!

221
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,200
Four, five...

222
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,480
six...

223
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,000
seven...

224
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,280
Now, I want my job back!

225
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,880
I want what I had before,
Mr. Naville!

226
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,040
I'm gonna count to five.

227
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,760
If you don't oblige me,
I'm gonna kill you.

228
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,280
One!

229
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,640
Two!

230
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,800
Three!

231
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,240
Four!

232
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,600
Five!

233
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:41,080
-What did you say that for?
-Five comes directly after four.

234
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,280
I know that!

235
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,600
I thought you had a problem.

236
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,080
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

237
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,080
Without access
to a proper education--

238
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,080
-Shut up!
-I was just trying to help.

239
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,960
I don't need any help.

240
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
You'll die for this,
I swear to God.

241
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,600
-I'm sorry. No.
-You could shoot him again.

242
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,000
In the head this time.
I'll count to five.

243
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,840
Shut up!

244
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,240
Who are you, anyway?

245
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,400
Nobody!

246
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,680
I'm his daughter.

247
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,960
This kid's got a gun.

248
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,320
Hey, cool it.

249
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,120
Take it easy, pal.
Chill out.

250
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,640
Drive!

251
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,440
Will you just drive?!

252
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,720
I can't.

253
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,800
-What?
-I don't know how.

254
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,880
-You don't know how to drive?
-I never learned.

255
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,080
-Why not?!
-I didn't need to!

256
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,280
Well, you do now!

257
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,240
This one makes it go faster,
that one slower.

258
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,400
This is forwards,
that's backwards.

259
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,880
The rest you can pick up
as we go along.

260
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,200
Drive!

261
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,440
Where are we going?

262
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,520
Never mind that.
Just drive more carefully.

263
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,040
He cut in on me.

264
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,160
Mirror, signal, maneuver.

265
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,760
You say nothing, OK?

266
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,080
- Afternoon, ma'am.
- Afternoon, sir.

267
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,320
My name's Walt.

268
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,760
I'm here to help you any way
I can during your visit...

269
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,960
be it short or long...

270
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,800
and whether it is purely
for refueling purposes...

271
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,720
or for the use of our extensive
washroom and retail facilities.

272
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,400
-Is this a gas station, Walt?
-It sure is, sir.

273
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,640
Then fill it up with gas
and cut the crap.

274
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,080
The guy was just doing his job.

275
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:05,520
You know, he was just trying
to be helpful.

276
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,280
You're in a lot of trouble,
you know?

277
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,320
My father's
gonna have you killed.

278
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,960
Do you realize that?

279
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,880
Tortured first, naturally.

280
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,160
Then he's gonna have you killed.

281
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,600
And what if I let you go?

282
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,560
I don't know. What do you think?

283
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,480
Think he's just gonna
forgive you?

284
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,200
Wait a minute.

285
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,160
Why would I ask him
to forgive me?

286
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,920
Your father treated me
like a piece of shit...

287
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,320
like I was nobody...

288
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,840
just because I was a cleaner--
like I was disposable.

289
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,280
Ahem.

290
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,800
Well, that's the tank full, sir.

291
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,080
Thank you, Walt.

292
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,520
That's for you, Walt.

293
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,880
You're a man, Walt.

294
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,120
Not a slave, not a machine.

295
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,800
Don't let anyone
ever treat you otherwise.

296
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,920
Go on.

297
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,760
It's empty.

298
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,480
Let's get this clear.

299
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,480
I'm not gonna hurt you...

300
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,440
but I am the kidnapper,
and you are the--

301
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,560
Victim.

302
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,920
That's just the way it is.

303
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,480
It's OK.
I've been through this before.

304
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,360
Kidnapped before?

305
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,520
Yeah. I was twelve.

306
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,160
-God, that's terrible.
-It was a long time ago.

307
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,800
So...so how am I doing?

308
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,840
In the kidnap?

309
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,960
Yeah.

310
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,160
So far,
you're not doing too bad.

311
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,520
Thank you.

312
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,280
Anyway, I'm just tying you up so
you can't escape in the night.

313
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,400
I know that.

314
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,760
Because, of course, you would.

315
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,680
Are you gonna try
to have sex with me?

316
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,160
No.

317
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,240
Isn't that what
you brought me up here for?

318
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,640
No, it's not.

319
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,240
It didn't even cross your mind?

320
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,680
No. Well--No.

321
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,280
Do you have a problem with sex?

322
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,800
No.

323
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,440
So you're just frightened of it?

324
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,560
No.

325
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,880
-Nervous, then?
-I'm not nervous.

326
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,640
-Then calm down.
-I'm perfectly calm.

327
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,520
I'm just trying to explain...

328
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,720
that there's no sexual motives
for my actions.

329
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,280
I'm glad we got that cleared up.

330
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,200
So, what did they do next?

331
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,480
They put a needle in my arm
and took a pint of blood...

332
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,440
and sent it to my father.

333
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,160
The next week
they did the same...

334
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,280
and the same the next week
till he paid up.

335
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,960
He waited six weeks.

336
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,080
That's what happens
to the victim.

337
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,800
Around our way

338
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,280
The sun shines bright

339
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,320
Around our way

340
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,520
The birds sing for ya

341
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,680
'Cause they already know ya

342
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,560
Enjoying the book?

343
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,880
No.

344
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,080
What's it about?

345
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,760
It's a romance.

346
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,520
This girl meets this guy.

347
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,000
They fall in love.

348
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,160
It's bullshit.

349
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,320
I'm writing a novel myself.

350
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,440
A lot of people say that,
but in my case, it's true.

351
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,640
I'm not interested...

352
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,520
in you or your novel...

353
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,400
or any other pathetic ambition
you have...

354
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:32,760
to change your miserable,
mundane existence.

355
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,600
Do you want some exercise?

356
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,720
No.

357
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,480
You can't say no. It's
not part of the arrangement.

358
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,760
-I want to read my book.
-You said it was bullshit.

359
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,000
Doesn't mean
I'm not enjoying it.

360
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,920
-You just said you weren't!
-A girl can change her mind.

361
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,920
"She heard
his breathing become shallow...

362
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,720
"and a flicker of a smile
chased across her lips...

363
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:03,000
"as she meditated on the power
she now held over him.

364
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,560
"'Are you sure you want
to catch that flight?'

365
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,960
"she asked."

366
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,280
Do you think
they're in love yet?

367
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,720
No.

368
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,640
If they are in love,
we can go home.

369
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I hate it down here.

370
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,840
I hate the air
and I hate the food...

371
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,320
and I hate the plumbing.

372
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,360
"She pulled him
closer, unable to stop."

373
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,560
I ache...all over.

374
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,680
"This, indeed,
was perfect love."

375
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,120
I sweat in the heat
and ache in the cold.

376
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,760
Why can't we stay
someplace decent?

377
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,480
Budget doesn't cover that.

378
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:46,680
Exactly. Why not?

379
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:51,240
You know those mysterious ways
you keep hearing about, Jackson?

380
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,400
Well, this is one of them.

381
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:58,280
"...cold, gloating gaze,
she let her hand droop down...

382
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,880
"towards the bulge
of his passion."

383
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,720
I remember the good old days.

384
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,680
"She heard
his breathing become shallow."

385
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,160
All you had to do
was introduce a man and a woman.

386
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,360
Nature did the rest.

387
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,480
"She gasped..."

388
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,600
Aah! Fuck!

389
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,360
"with surprise and delight."

390
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,120
Doesn't work like that anymore.

391
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,000
"All of her soul
erupted between her thighs...

392
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,040
"as she sensed the firm,
exploratory pressure...

393
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,200
"of his warm flesh."

394
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,280
Men and women--
it's all gone to shit.

395
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,600
Sure has.

396
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,560
"In the hidden recess
of her pelvis...

397
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,840
"their bodies fused
into one writhing mass...

398
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,720
of torrid, torrid sexual..."

399
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,400
Aren't you hungry?

400
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,160
I don't eat red meat.

401
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,480
Well, you could eat
the vegetables.

402
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,320
They're on the same plate.

403
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,200
So?

404
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,960
I'm not gonna eat this.

405
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,640
Do you eat fish and poultry?

406
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,920
Yes.

407
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,600
But not red meat?

408
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,800
No. Or eggs, unless I know
they're free-range.

409
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,760
Then why didn't you tell me
you don't like meat?

410
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,400
Because you didn't ask!

411
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,920
And I do like meat.
I just don't eat it.

412
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,360
Moral reasons, if you must know.

413
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,920
If you had taken the time
to inquire--

414
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,880
Why are you such a pain
to be with?

415
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,560
Because you tied me to a chair
all night!

416
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,200
Because I am the victim...

417
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,960
and you are the kidnapper,
apparently!

418
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,080
Meaning exactly what?

419
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,520
"Kidnap For Beginners"--
chapter one--

420
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,800
have you even asked
for a ransom yet?

421
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,920
Don't say a word
until I tell you.

422
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,160
Hello. Mr. Naville?

423
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,600
It--it's me.

424
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,040
Now, I want my--

425
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,520
Me.

426
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,600
The kidnapper!

427
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:19,840
Right. Now, what I want--

428
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,400
It's not like that.

429
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,600
That's unfair now. I would not--

430
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,320
What are you doing?

431
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,240
No, what are you doing?

432
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,520
I'm negotiating
with your father.

433
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,760
-Did you get very far?
-Well, he kept interrupting.

434
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,680
-Right.
-Wouldn't let me finish.

435
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,280
Remember
what they didn't teach you...

436
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,720
at Harvard Business School, OK?

437
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,320
I didn't go
to Harvard Business School.

438
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,480
It's a figure of speech, Robert.

439
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,920
Sorry.

440
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,240
Negotiation is a weakness.

441
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,680
You are the kidnapper.

442
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,960
You demand, and he complies.

443
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,600
You go in hard,
and you go in fast.

444
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,880
-Hard and fast.
-Right.

445
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,360
I'm you.

446
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,640
You grasp that?

447
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,640
OK.

448
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,480
Pretend it's ringing.
You psych yourself up.

449
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,880
Go to your dark side.

450
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,720
OK. He answers.

451
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:13,520
All right, you motherfucker,
I've got your daughter here.

452
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:16,160
I'm sending her back in pieces
if I don't get what I want.

453
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,520
I'm gonna pull her fingers out
with pliers...

454
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,200
and then I'm gonna fry them up
for breakfast, understand?

455
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,560
And so on and so on
like that, OK?

456
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,920
For no longer than
thirty seconds.

457
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,320
What?

458
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,040
Hello there. Mr. Naville?
Now--

459
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,920
Right, you asshole,
I've got your daughter here...

460
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,320
and I'm gonna cut her up...

461
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,920
and post her home to you
in boxes! Small boxes!

462
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,240
Right, daughter,
I've got your asshole here...

463
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,560
and I'm gonna send--

464
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,400
Right! Right!

465
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,480
No, I can't speak to anyone!
I need to speak to him!

466
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,680
Hello?

467
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,480
Yeah, I can hold.

468
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:19,200
Right, listen, you asshole,
I've got your daughter here...

469
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,240
and I'm gonna send her back
in pieces unless--

470
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,560
Oh, I'm sorry, madam.

471
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,520
No, I must've dialed
the wrong number.

472
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,400
No, I haven't got
your daughter here.

473
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,760
I have someone else's.

474
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,640
No, we're not married.

475
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,680
Yes, I've read the same thing.

476
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,840
It's very hard to find
suitable young men these days.

477
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,080
Well, I'm sure
your daughter's very nice.

478
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,240
In principle, I've got
no objections to meeting her--

479
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,120
What is the problem?

480
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,720
I think you should
just send a letter.

481
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,040
Done this kind of work before?

482
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,480
We do everything.

483
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:54,360
Eviction and debt collection
are our daily bread...

484
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,600
but personal retrieval,
bounty hunting--

485
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,240
you name it, we do it.

486
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,360
How much?

487
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,280
Our fee for the recovery
of your daughter is...

488
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,200
one hundred thousand dollars.

489
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,720
That's a lot of money.

490
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,360
Five thousand advance.

491
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,720
The rest is cash on delivery.
No daughter, no dough.

492
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,680
Naturally,
we operate a sliding scale...

493
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,440
whereby if we only bring back
part of your daughter...

494
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,560
we only get part of the money.

495
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,680
That's enough, Jackson.

496
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,960
If he's cut her ears off,
and we can’t find them...

497
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,360
we'll knock a couple thousand
off the tariff.

498
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,880
More for a limb, obviously.

499
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,200
Jackson.

500
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,320
Sorry.

501
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,640
Mr. Naville,
I don't think you need to worry.

502
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,640
My partner is simply envisaging
a worst-case scenario.

503
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,160
What about the kidnapper?

504
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,840
You want him, too?

505
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,560
That's extra.

506
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,040
What if he gets in the way?

507
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,280
We'll deal with that situation
if it arises.

508
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,320
What if I want him
to get in the way?

509
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,440
Let us speak plainly,
Mr. Naville.

510
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,720
You want we should kill him?

511
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,200
Yes.

512
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,680
Sir, I must say--

513
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,520
No one's asking you, Mayhew.

514
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,760
Very good, sir.

515
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,720
I am not gonna kill anyone.

516
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:15,800
If we don't get this job,
someone else will.

517
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:28,920
-Two hundred thousand dollars.
-Including expenses?

518
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,960
Including all expenses...

519
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,560
except medical costs...

520
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,080
for which you accept full
and unlimited responsibility.

521
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,920
Only for the duration
of the contract.

522
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,880
-Naturally.
-It's a deal.

523
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,960
Good afternoon.

524
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,880
Hi.

525
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:15,720
I'm Tod Johnson.

526
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,440
I live up the hill.

527
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,720
That's nice.

528
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,520
I see most things from up there.

529
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,120
Saw you arrive.

530
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:29,440
Big car, middle of the night.

531
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,600
Right.

532
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,640
Wondered "Who's that?"

533
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,800
Perfectly natural question.

534
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,240
So I asked Felix.

535
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,360
Felix?

536
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,680
Felix is my friend.

537
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,800
He hasn't been the same
since the war.

538
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,320
Of course.

539
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,840
I asked him.
I said, "Felix, tell me...

540
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,760
"are they good,
or are they evil?"

541
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,520
One bark for good, two for evil.

542
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,280
Felix is a dog?

543
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:57,400
Do you think
that I would talk to a dog?

544
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,480
Do you think
I would ask a dog...

545
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,200
whether or not
you're good or evil?

546
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,640
What do you think I am...

547
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,520
some kind
of a crazy backwoods lunatic...

548
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,440
with a barn
full of human skulls...

549
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,200
and a scythe
that I sharpen every day...

550
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,800
in readiness for Armageddon?

551
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,920
No.
I'm sure you're a regular guy.

552
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,080
Right! I'm regular!
I am a regular man.

553
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,000
I want...

554
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,880
That's not the point!
The point is, who are you?!

555
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,120
Who are you?!

556
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,080
Well, I'm...

557
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,120
We're newlyweds.

558
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,320
Are you coming back to bed
soon, darling?

559
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,640
This is Mr. Johnson, dear.

560
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,120
Hello.

561
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,200
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.

562
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,000
You can call me Lucille.

563
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,040
My pleasure, Lucille.

564
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,480
You're not
from the newspapers, are you?

565
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,720
I live up the hill.

566
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,320
Oh, good. You can't tell
the newspapers we're here.

567
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:01,160
They never leave us alone,
on account of Ritchie.

568
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,640
Ritchie?

569
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,960
You recognize Ritchie,
don't you?

570
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,560
Ritchie Vanderlow?

571
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,640
Six gold albums...

572
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,600
three platinum.

573
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:13,200
Fourteen consecutive
top-ten singles.

574
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,320
Largest-selling artist
worldwide...

575
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,680
for the last twelve months?

576
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,480
Ritchie Vanderlow!

577
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,880
You have got to understand,
ma'am...

578
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:23,840
I watch mainly
the biblical channels.

579
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,680
It's OK.

580
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,600
We were married in secret...

581
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,120
in a castle in Scotland.

582
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,360
That's in England.

583
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,040
Near Paris?

584
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,160
Paris.

585
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,680
Right.

586
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,480
It was so romantic.

587
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,680
We stayed there
for our honeymoon...

588
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,800
but it wasn't long enough...

589
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,440
so we came here for the sake
of a little privacy.

590
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,280
Mmm. I see.

591
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,440
Would you like to come in...

592
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,640
Mr. Johnson?

593
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,000
No, I better be on my way.

594
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,080
I have to feed Felix.

595
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,680
OK.

596
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,160
Well...

597
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:08,320
it was a pleasure to meet you,
Mr. Johnson.

598
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,280
See you around.

599
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,640
I'll catch you later then,
Mr. Johnson.

600
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,520
Take care, Ritchie.

601
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,400
Thanks.

602
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,880
This?

603
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,320
The ransom note.

604
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,480
-Right. Anonymous.
-Yeah.

605
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,200
Robert...

606
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,880
my father knows who you are.

607
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,440
Oh, I never thought of that.

608
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,280
You are the worst kidnapper
I've ever met.

609
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,880
Oh, and that's all I am
to you, isn't it?

610
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,360
The latest kidnapper!

611
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,040
A lifestyle accessory.

612
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,520
And if it doesn't work,
it doesn't matter...

613
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,200
'cause you can always
get another one.

614
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,560
Quit being so melodramatic.

615
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,320
I'm trying to do my best here...

616
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,920
under really difficult
circumstances!

617
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,680
It's not made any easier...

618
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,920
by you criticizing
everything I do!

619
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,720
-How much you asking for?
-Half a million.

620
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,480
-Dollars?
-Yes.

621
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,440
-U.S. Dollars?
-Is there a problem?

622
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:25,880
Half a million dollars
isn't a lot of money for me!

623
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,440
It's not meant
to reflect you as an individual.

624
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:31,720
If word got out I was liberated
for half a million...

625
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,800
I could never show my face
in polite society again.

626
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,400
Diamonds have no value except
that which is placed upon them.

627
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,520
It's more complicated
than I thought!

628
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,320
OK, don't worry...

629
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,760
all right?

630
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,480
You're trying hard.

631
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,880
You're keen to learn.
That's important.

632
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,000
Let's just not
lose sight of the fact...

633
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,440
that we have the opportunity...

634
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,280
to make
millions of dollars here.

635
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:56,680
We?

636
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,640
Yes, Robert.

637
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,920
You and me.

638
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,960
Is that not a little irregular?

639
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,280
Yes, it is.

640
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,680
Millions?

641
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,920
Please, dad,
just give him the money!

642
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,840
He's gonna kill me, daddy!

643
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:19,880
Please! Just put it
in the trunk of the car...

644
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,520
two miles south of Palmer,
please, daddy!

645
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,720
Daddy!

646
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,680
OK, OK, OK.

647
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,920
OK, OK.

648
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,240
Nice shooting.

649
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,720
Thanks.

650
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,560
Shit.

651
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,960
No problem.

652
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,640
Exactly as you predicted.

653
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,240
"Quick, drive my car."

654
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,240
Here's forty dollars.

655
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,880
If you don't mind me asking...

656
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,440
how did you know
he'd react like that?

657
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,080
It's our job
to know things like that.

658
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,960
You done
this sort of thing before?

659
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,520
Let's go!

660
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:23,000
You can take the car,
but remember, it's stolen.

661
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,840
Look,
they weren't trying to kill you.

662
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,800
They were trying to confuse you
and scare you.

663
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,640
Yeah, before they killed me.

664
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:38,600
And I lost the car,
and I didn't get any money.

665
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,960
You can't expect to get
everything right the first time.

666
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,360
Look, you are going to be fine.

667
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,280
You are going to be...

668
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,760
a success.

669
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,320
Do you think so?

670
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,360
You didn't get caught, right?

671
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,880
No.

672
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,880
No, I didn't get caught.

673
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,320
I fooled them.

674
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,800
I got away.

675
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,320
Maybe we should go out.

676
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,600
Out where?

677
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,600
For a drink.

678
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,560
What, like on a date?

679
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,720
Yeah, like a date.

680
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,920
I wouldn't call it
a bad relationship.

681
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,680
No, Lily and I, we just...

682
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,760
You know,
we just grew apart as people.

683
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:24,200
There was no bitterness
on either side.

684
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,360
She left you?

685
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,480
No, no, no, no. No!

686
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,800
Yes, she left me.

687
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,240
Mmm.

688
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,960
The aerobics instructor.

689
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,920
How did you know?

690
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,080
You have the demeanor...

691
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,400
of a man who's been left
for an aerobics instructor.

692
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,840
-I do?
-Yeah.

693
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:45,720
But be honest.
It was inevitable.

694
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,640
You two weren't suited
for one another.

695
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,640
You dream of something better.
She wants it now.

696
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:52,280
Hence, the gymnast.
Am I right?

697
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,400
Well, yeah.

698
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,360
Yeah. It's a common scenario.

699
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:00,280
Can I tell you about
this dream I have? You're in it.

700
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,480
I'm in your dream?

701
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,720
Now I feel violated.

702
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,720
-Oh, it's not like that.
-I don't wanna hear it.

703
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,680
Perhaps this is
a good opportunity...

704
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,200
to tell you about my novel.

705
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,840
Look, I'm not interested
in your novel.

706
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,280
It's 1962, right?

707
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,840
And Marilyn Monroe...

708
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:19,080
is giving birth to a baby girl.

709
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,720
She's on the phone
to Jack Kennedy...

710
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,440
saying, "Jack, it's yours.
It's yours, Jack."

711
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,080
So the orphan grows up...

712
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,960
And she solves
some great mystery, right?

713
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,800
It's kind of obvious, Robert.

714
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:37,080
Let's play a game.

715
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,440
If I win...

716
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,560
I go free.

717
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:45,440
Look, you are free.
The kidnap's over.

718
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,880
You're more a kidnapper
than I am Ritchie Vanderlow.

719
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:50,160
Indulge me, Robert.

720
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,320
Well, if it's what you want.

721
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,840
It's all I ever want.

722
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,120
OK.

723
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,400
You're free.

724
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,720
That's right.

725
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,240
Aren't you gonna leave?

726
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,640
We haven't got our money yet.

727
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,520
Don't take your love to town

728
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:39,440
Oh, Ruby

729
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,440
For God's sakes, turn around

730
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:44,640
Big hand! Big hand!

731
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:47,520
Big hand for local boy
Scottie Sherman.

732
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:52,600
We are privileged
to have here tonight...

733
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,240
a very special guest...

734
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:56,880
who is a close personal friend
of mine...

735
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:00,080
and I'm gonna ask him
to come up here and sing a song.

736
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:03,440
He is the best-selling artist
in the world...

737
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,560
with twelve gold albums...

738
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:08,160
sixteen platinum albums...

739
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:11,360
and thirty-two
number-one hit singles!

740
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:15,760
Mr. Ritchie Vanderclaw!

741
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:45,520
Thank you very much.

742
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:48,440
My name is Rob--
Ritchie Vanderlow...

743
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,360
and, um...

744
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:54,640
I'd like to sing this song
for my beautiful wife...

745
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:57,120
Lucille.

746
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:03,160
Oh, and this is
a very special song for us.

747
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:12,360
Somewhere

748
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:14,920
Beyond the sea

749
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,200
Somewhere

750
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:19,080
Waiting for me

751
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:21,000
My lover stands

752
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:23,880
On golden sands

753
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:25,960
And watches the ships

754
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:29,640
That go sailing

755
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:32,520
Somewhere

756
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,600
Beyond the sea

757
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:35,880
She's there

758
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:39,080
Watching for me

759
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:40,760
And if I could fly

760
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:43,800
Like birds on high

761
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:45,960
Then straight to her arms

762
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:49,480
I'd go sailing

763
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:51,720
It's far

764
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:54,040
Beyond the stars

765
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:55,800
It's near

766
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:58,240
Beyond the moon

767
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:02,360
I know

768
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:04,120
Beyond a doubt

769
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:06,040
My heart

770
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:07,760
Will lead me there

771
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,240
Soon

772
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:10,880
We'll meet

773
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:14,360
Beyond the shore

774
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:15,640
We'll kiss

775
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:18,520
Just like before

776
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,440
And happy we'll be

777
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:23,400
Beyond the sea

778
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,400
And never again

779
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:28,880
I'll go sailing

780
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:01,280
I know

781
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,000
I know

782
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:03,960
Beyond a doubt

783
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:05,480
My heart

784
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:07,440
Will lead me there

785
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:09,000
Soon

786
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:10,640
We'll meet

787
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:16,880
Touches my heart
to see two young people in love.

788
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:20,040
Happy we'll be

789
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:23,080
Beyond the sea

790
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:25,040
And never again

791
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:28,840
I'll go sailing

792
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:49,680
Hmm.

793
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:57,720
Oh, my God. What happened?

794
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:00,040
You were great.

795
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:02,880
I was?

796
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:04,040
Mm-hmm.

797
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:13,080
I remember drinking tequila.

798
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:15,680
Certainly was a feature
of the evening.

799
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:19,440
Then I had
an incredible dream.

800
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:22,400
This dream, I've had it before.

801
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,240
You're definitely in it now.

802
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:25,880
I don't want to hear it.

803
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:29,240
We were on this
game show called Perfect Love.

804
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:30,960
Never heard of it.

805
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,360
Well, it's just a dream.

806
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:34,440
I don't think the fact
that it's a game show...

807
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:35,680
has any relevance.

808
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:38,120
It merely indicates
my cultural origins.

809
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:41,520
I mean, were I a tribesman
in the Kalahari, for instance...

810
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:44,880
the location would undoubtedly
have been different.

811
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:47,040
But I think
the theme is universal.

812
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:49,560
We're on this game show
called Perfect Love.

813
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:51,960
My life was in danger.

814
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:53,400
Are you ready?

815
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:55,320
Am I ready for what?

816
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:56,840
To write a letter.

817
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:05,240
Perhaps you'd like to keep this.

818
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:06,680
We had it analyzed.

819
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:08,840
It's his handwriting
and her blood.

820
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:10,560
Without our help,
Mr. Naville...

821
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,200
that could be the last trace
of your daughter you ever see.

822
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:15,560
He wants a straight
switch with no delays.

823
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,080
-I want her back.
-Don't worry. We'll get her.

824
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:23,200
And I want him dead.

825
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:24,600
That's understood, Mr. Naville.

826
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:26,040
Good.

827
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:31,800
And when this is over,
I want this back.

828
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:39,800
Bradley was nice, you know?

829
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:41,800
Extremely wealthy.

830
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,920
Honorable, amusing.

831
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,840
And?

832
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:50,240
Well, eighty-seven years old.

833
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,560
-Ha ha. Pity.
-Yeah.

834
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:54,000
Then there was Jake.

835
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:55,440
He was nice.

836
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,200
Very rich.

837
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,800
Just so conventional.

838
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:00,640
You see?
Rich guys. Conventional.

839
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:01,760
It's a problem.

840
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:04,080
Then there was Angelo.

841
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:06,760
Twenty-five years old...

842
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:08,240
handsome, healthy...

843
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:10,000
exciting...

844
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:11,920
sophisticated.

845
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,080
Considerate.

846
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:19,760
So?

847
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,720
Well, I think
that we just sort of, um...

848
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:27,400
grew apart as people.

849
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:33,560
The aerobics instructor?

850
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:38,960
Like I said...

851
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:41,360
it's a common scenario.

852
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:46,000
So who was next?

853
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:49,080
Then I started getting
problems with my teeth.

854
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:50,760
With your teeth?

855
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:52,640
Yeah, my teeth.

856
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:55,760
Hey, want a ride?

857
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:57,640
Hi, thanks for stopping, guys.

858
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:00,400
Uh, we're not stealing it,
we're just borrowing it.

859
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,280
Had that dream again last night.

860
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:04,040
What dream?

861
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:06,280
We were
on that game show Perfect Love.

862
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:08,680
-Mmm. Fascinating.
-And my life was in danger.

863
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:09,800
On a game show?

864
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:11,560
I know.
It's difficult to explain.

865
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:13,000
Strange things were happening.

866
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:14,920
Mmm. So it would appear.

867
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,840
But my life was in danger...

868
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:18,760
and you saved it.

869
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:21,160
My heart was beating so fast...

870
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:22,760
and then it stopped.

871
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:25,000
And I was just about to die...

872
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:26,440
and you saved it.

873
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:28,360
You saved my life.

874
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:30,320
Well, what are we waiting for?

875
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:35,040
You want to get on with this
or not?

876
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:36,600
Sure!

877
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:38,840
You send the girl over.

878
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:41,040
Ha ha. First the money.
That was the deal.

879
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:44,880
Are you OK, Miss Naville?

880
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:46,680
Yes, I'm OK.

881
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:49,200
I'm just a little frightened.

882
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:09,960
Now, don't you worry, miss.

883
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:12,440
Everything'll be all right.

884
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:25,920
Well?

885
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,560
Whew. It's here.

886
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:32,120
OK? Send the girl over.

887
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:35,000
OK, go on.

888
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:36,320
Ohh, damn.

889
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:40,680
Help!

890
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:42,040
Get down! Get down!

891
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:44,520
Yes.

892
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:46,760
They tied me up! Ohh!

893
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:48,840
Ha ha!

894
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:30,040
Don't move a fucking muscle.

895
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:34,000
Mmm.

896
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:36,400
What took you?

897
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,960
He shot up the car!

898
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:43,760
You shot up our car.

899
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:46,280
Now, what did you do that for?

900
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:49,480
I was trying to make a getaway.

901
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:53,720
You were trying
to make a getaway?

902
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:08,280
How is she?

903
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:09,760
I don't know.

904
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,000
But I don't think it's worked.

905
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:18,000
They're not...you know?

906
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:19,640
Jeopardy.
Jeopardy, Jackson--

907
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:23,080
always works.

908
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:43,960
OK.

909
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:48,120
This is far enough.

910
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:55,600
Are you--are you going
to kill me?

911
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:56,720
Yeah.

912
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,800
Well, then I don't see
why I should dig.

913
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:03,920
If you dig...

914
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:06,320
I promise you
when the time comes...

915
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:07,480
I'll shoot you through the head.

916
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:10,440
Now, look, you don't like that?

917
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:11,920
I can just shoot you through
the testicles right now.

918
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:13,280
You can bleed to death.
I'll dig the grave.

919
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:16,000
It's up to you.

920
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:32,240
Can you cut me free?

921
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:35,160
Please?

922
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:37,560
It's sore.

923
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:43,440
What's he going to do with him?

924
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,640
Shoot him in the back
of the head.

925
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:50,720
Right.

926
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:55,080
Would that be a problem for you?

927
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:01,960
Ever felt like
you're not in control of events?

928
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:03,160
Yes.

929
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,360
No, I mean...

930
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:09,040
something is...

931
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:10,760
destined to happen...

932
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:11,880
and it doesn't?

933
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:16,800
Like, what happens
when the forces of destiny...

934
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,200
are no longer in control?

935
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:22,480
I don't know.

936
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:26,400
The truth is...

937
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:30,240
I don't think even he knows
what's going on down here--

938
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:32,400
the chaos, the...

939
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:35,640
This hatred, this violence.

940
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:36,800
Who...

941
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:39,560
Who are you talking about?

942
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:44,560
Jeopardy, Jackson...

943
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:46,040
always works.

944
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:50,360
Dig.

945
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:58,240
What are they doing in there?

946
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:01,200
Should've shot him myself.

947
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:03,680
Yeah, well, you can't
trust them to do anything.

948
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:07,600
I take it you're not
in a love situation.

949
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:08,720
What?

950
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:11,760
I mean you're not in love.

951
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:13,520
What's it to you?

952
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:16,280
Nothing.

953
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:20,560
Just asking.

954
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:24,080
I like it like that

955
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:26,160
And I know it

956
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,600
That's OK. You can stop now.

957
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:31,560
No.

958
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:32,840
I've waited long enough.

959
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:36,600
No.

960
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:38,520
Give me that. Lie down.

961
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:40,440
No, no. No!

962
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:43,360
Give it to me! Give it to me!

963
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:44,520
Please!

964
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:47,800
-Please.
-Shh.

965
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:55,840
Leave it all behind

966
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:56,960
I commit you to his mercy.

967
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:58,960
Please. Please. Please.

968
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:10,640
No! No!

969
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:11,960
Get up!

970
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:13,440
Robert, get off!

971
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:19,400
Who are they?

972
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:20,880
Come on!

973
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:24,520
That's what keeps me

974
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:26,520
That's what keeps me

975
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:28,000
That's what keeps me down

976
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:35,520
Just for a minute there,
I thought we were in trouble.

977
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:37,440
I told you don't get caught.

978
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:39,200
Don't get out of the car.

979
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:41,120
Don't ever go into the woods
with a stranger.

980
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:43,240
-I know. You're right.
-I'm always right, OK?

981
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:45,280
You might like to remember that.

982
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:46,440
Have you got the money?

983
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:53,360
No! Jesus!

984
00:58:57,840 --> 00:58:58,920
I'm going to get you.

985
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:11,680
Shit.

986
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:27,000
-Oh, shit.
-Where is she?

987
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:28,520
Oh, shit.

988
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:34,280
Drive!

989
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:56,840
Jesus!

990
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:00,480
-Jump!
-What?

991
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:01,720
Jump!

992
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:21,920
If the card is no good,
I'm authorized to destroy it.

993
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,600
It's my card, lady.
Listen, you don't understand.

994
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:27,640
-Is there a problem?
-I'm sorry about this, ma'am.

995
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:31,200
Don't worry. Don't worry.

996
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:32,560
I've got some cash, OK?

997
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:33,680
Thirty dollars, sir.

998
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:36,760
Thank you.

999
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:43,800
How could he
do a thing like that?

1000
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:45,280
Stay calm, OK?

1001
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:53,640
My own father.
He canceled my credit card.

1002
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:56,520
I've never been so humiliated
in all my life.

1003
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:59,440
-I know exactly how you feel.
-You couldn't possibly know.

1004
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:02,200
Only the exceptionally rich
can know how I feel right now.

1005
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:03,320
Don't take it personally.

1006
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:06,160
Is he trying to say
I’ll find my own natural level?

1007
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:08,120
Sink to the bottom like her?

1008
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:10,840
Like who?
Who are you talking about?

1009
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:12,440
Pull over.

1010
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:22,120
Oh, no.

1011
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:29,640
Oh, no, no, no.

1012
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:30,760
Live a little.

1013
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:32,200
This is insane.

1014
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:34,720
Stop worrying so much.
It'll be my first time, too.

1015
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:36,040
That's what I'm worrying about.

1016
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:38,880
Trust me.
I know what I'm doing.

1017
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:40,080
Next.

1018
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:43,400
Hello.
I'd like to make a withdrawal.

1019
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:46,320
I thought we agreed--
no clichés.

1020
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:53,040
Fill the bag.

1021
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:54,480
Oh, my God, she's got a gun!

1022
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:00,360
Leave my daughter alone.
Please, leave her alone!

1023
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:02,480
-Don't be silly.
-She's going to kill her!

1024
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:03,680
She's not going to kill
your daughter.

1025
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:04,960
-Yes, I am.
-What?

1026
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:06,880
Shut up.

1027
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:07,960
Christ, no!

1028
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:09,080
Everybody calm down...,

1029
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:11,120
or this girl's brains
will splatter the wall.

1030
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:12,920
-Fill the bag!
-Celine!

1031
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,520
You shut up especially.

1032
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:16,160
You can't hold the girl hostage.

1033
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:17,520
What?

1034
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:18,640
WOOh, no!

1035
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:20,080
You didn’t find it difficult.

1036
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:22,040
-That was different.
-Was it?

1037
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:24,680
Didn’t feel different.
It felt just like this.

1038
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Now do you understand
how it felt, Robert?

1039
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:31,640
But you, unlike me,
couldn't pull the trigger.

1040
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:33,920
-Oh, no.
-Good-bye, Robert.

1041
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,840
OK, kill me,
but don't touch the girl!

1042
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:39,920
Extremely amusing!

1043
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:41,200
"Kill me,
but don't touch the girl."

1044
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:42,800
Robert,
you should be on television.

1045
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:44,760
-Very funny.
-What's wrong?

1046
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:47,520
What's wrong? I thought
you were going to shoot me!

1047
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:48,680
That's what's wrong!

1048
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:50,640
Shoot you? I wouldn't do that.

1049
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:53,200
-Oh, no?
-No! I'm having a great time!

1050
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:55,720
-Oh, good!
-Yeah, certainly is!

1051
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:19,280
What's wrong?

1052
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:23,800
Celine, it's over.

1053
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:40,200
I'm dying, Celine.

1054
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:41,760
I think I'm dying,
and I don't want to die.

1055
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:43,440
You're not going to die.

1056
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:44,920
I don't want to die.

1057
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:48,000
Are you taking me to a hospital?

1058
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:50,040
Because I don't want to die
in a hospital.

1059
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:52,560
I'm not going
to take you to a hospital.

1060
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:56,200
What do you mean, you're not
taking me to a hospital?

1061
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:59,240
Take me to a hospital!
Where are you taking me?

1062
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:02,000
Very nice.

1063
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:03,280
Very nice, indeed.

1064
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:06,800
You could have a perfect smile.

1065
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:09,600
For two thousand dollars,
you could change your life.

1066
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:10,760
No, thanks.

1067
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:13,960
Do you think a perfect smile
just happens?

1068
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:15,560
Is that what you think? Huh?

1069
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:17,640
Do you think that Celine's smile
is her own?

1070
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:18,800
No, it's not.

1071
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:20,360
It's mine.

1072
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:21,840
I gave it to her...

1073
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:23,880
just like I can give you one.

1074
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,200
I’ll fix your teeth
for twelve thousand dollars.

1075
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:26,720
I didn't get shot in the teeth.

1076
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:28,920
Well, let me tell you something.

1077
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,760
It wouldn't have made
too much difference if you had.

1078
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:32,880
I don't want to say anything.

1079
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:35,120
It's your teeth,
but if you wait another year...

1080
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:38,280
you'll have fifty grand worth
of major reconstruction, so...

1081
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:40,080
If you wait another year...

1082
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:41,200
he'll be dead.

1083
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:45,920
Sorry. Just a little
free consultation.

1084
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:52,880
You know,
they wanted me to take a break.

1085
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:54,000
Take a break.

1086
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:56,960
Go get counseling, you know?

1087
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:58,080
Fuck them. What do they know?

1088
01:05:58,160 --> 01:05:59,280
They wanted me to stay
in the hospital.

1089
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:01,200
I discharged myself
this afternoon.

1090
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:02,360
Lucky for you that I did, huh?

1091
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:04,720
OK.

1092
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:06,440
Have you, um, done this before?

1093
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:08,680
The principles of surgery...

1094
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:11,120
are the same
above and below the neck.

1095
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:19,760
Aren't you going
to anesthetize me?

1096
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:22,280
I'm sure you'll pass out
as the pain gets worse.

1097
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:41,760
Give me another one.

1098
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:43,120
Here we go, baby.

1099
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:51,280
Give it to me hot.
You look lovely.

1100
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:52,560
Thank you.

1101
01:06:57,120 --> 01:06:59,280
Give me the Bambi, baby.

1102
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:00,800
That's it.

1103
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:02,120
God!

1104
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:05,080
OK, turn over. Turn over.

1105
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:07,680
-What?
-Turn over, darling.

1106
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:09,440
Turn...

1107
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:10,680
There you go.

1108
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:12,680
Flash me the tush.

1109
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:14,560
One heel.

1110
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:17,880
Excellent.

1111
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:21,160
Mmm.

1112
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:26,120
Robbie!

1113
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:28,040
Hey, how are you? Come on.

1114
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:29,400
Join the party.

1115
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:30,520
Come on.

1116
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:31,880
Do you want some champagne?

1117
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:33,680
How rude of me. Excuse me, love.

1118
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:36,440
Oh, wait.

1119
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:40,600
Here you go.

1120
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:43,040
Here. Look at that.

1121
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:46,840
So, I understand that you're--
Here, please.

1122
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:48,720
I understand that
you're something of a fugitive.

1123
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,680
Don't be shocked.

1124
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:53,840
We go back a long way.

1125
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:55,920
Oh, I see. You're her dentist.

1126
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,680
Yup. That's right.

1127
01:07:57,720 --> 01:08:00,400
We met over that particularly
fine set of ivories.

1128
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:01,760
In fact...

1129
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:03,320
I gave her her first filling.

1130
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:09,160
Fuck.

1131
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:11,520
Oh, I wish
you hadn't done that.

1132
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:14,120
Now I have to hurt you...

1133
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:17,320
which is inconvenient
and undignified.

1134
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:23,800
Fucker.

1135
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:25,080
Get up!

1136
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:27,240
Leave him alone, Elliot.

1137
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:28,680
Why don't you
stay out of this?

1138
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:37,560
Are you all right?

1139
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:10,520
You want to explain to me...

1140
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:12,840
exactly what you were trying
to achieve back there?

1141
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:15,160
How about you
do some explaining to me?

1142
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:17,080
I didn't want you to
bleed to death...

1143
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:19,280
and I think I saved your life.

1144
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:21,680
I'd rather have died
than have witnessed that.

1145
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:23,000
Witnessed what, exactly?

1146
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:25,640
You and Elliot in
an advanced state of foreplay.

1147
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:27,880
He would've passed out
drunk in five minutes...

1148
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:29,160
if you hadn't come along.

1149
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:30,280
Yeah, sure.

1150
01:09:30,360 --> 01:09:32,720
Even if we were
about to get physical...

1151
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:34,400
what's it got to do with you
anyway?

1152
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:43,960
You thought we had something?

1153
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:45,360
It's possible.

1154
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:46,480
But why?

1155
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:48,720
Why do we
have to have something?

1156
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:50,840
We were getting along just fine.

1157
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:52,720
Having something
ruins everything.

1158
01:09:55,880 --> 01:09:59,440
What will you do now,
ask me to marry you?

1159
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:00,880
Of course I'm not.

1160
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:03,080
-You thought about it.
-Don't be absurd.

1161
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:04,520
It never even occurred to you?

1162
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:06,720
Well, it wouldn't be so bad.

1163
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:07,880
You see what I mean?
Just forget it.

1164
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:09,400
Consider it forgotten.

1165
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:14,880
Where do you want to go?

1166
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:16,080
Don't care.

1167
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:18,680
Do you want to get out
of the car?

1168
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:20,920
-Are you asking me to get out?
-No. I'm asking if you want to.

1169
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,120
-It's the same thing.
-It's not the same thing.

1170
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:24,880
One is a request,
the other is a question.

1171
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:27,400
Fine. If that's what
you want, then I'll get out.

1172
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:29,480
If that's what you want,
I won't stop you.

1173
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:31,000
And don't even ask
where I'm going!

1174
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:32,760
Don't even imagine that I care.

1175
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:34,000
Exactly the problem!

1176
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:01,400
Fuck.

1177
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:17,800
Stop hovering over me.
I can't concentrate.

1178
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:20,760
Have you written anything yet?

1179
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:22,240
I--I--

1180
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:26,000
What am I supposed to write?

1181
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:28,400
Love letters, Jackson,
deal with the subject of love.

1182
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:31,360
I need time to think.

1183
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:33,000
We don't have time.

1184
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:35,160
Every day they spend apart...

1185
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:38,000
the more difficult
it's going to be.

1186
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:40,520
And if Naville finds our boy...

1187
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:44,280
he's just meat.

1188
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:53,640
So, think, Jackson...

1189
01:11:53,680 --> 01:11:55,960
have you ever done this before?

1190
01:11:57,080 --> 01:11:59,400
Back when I was alive,
there was a girl.

1191
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:03,360
You wrote to some girl?

1192
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:05,200
A long time ago.

1193
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:07,280
You never told me about this.

1194
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:09,960
It never came to nothing.

1195
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:13,000
Her father
did not approve our match.

1196
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:15,880
It was just young love,
but I wrote...

1197
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:18,600
many times...

1198
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:20,280
with passion...

1199
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:21,560
and despair.

1200
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:32,040
I never knew
you had a romantic soul.

1201
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:38,680
I often wonder
what became of that girl--

1202
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:40,920
sweet Eliza.

1203
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:44,320
Eliza...

1204
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:45,480
Gray.

1205
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:51,440
Her father was a colonel.

1206
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:54,400
Jackson, you're qualified.

1207
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:57,680
You can write this letter.

1208
01:12:57,720 --> 01:12:59,280
That's the problem, see?

1209
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:03,160
I wrote to her, sure,
but I didn't write letters.

1210
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:05,440
Well, what, then?

1211
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:07,800
As a matter of fact...

1212
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:09,040
I...

1213
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:10,640
wrote...

1214
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:12,120
love poems.

1215
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:26,160
Remember, my dear...

1216
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:28,000
they only want one thing.

1217
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:31,400
Maybe they want it
more than once...

1218
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:34,640
but it's still
only one thing.

1219
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:02,000
I wish you had let me
read that poem.

1220
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:03,600
A poem...

1221
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:06,480
is a very personal document.

1222
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:08,600
I hope it was a good one.

1223
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:10,200
That's all I'm saying.

1224
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:12,960
Because if she don't like it,
she won't come.

1225
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:14,520
And if she don't come,
we're stuck.

1226
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:17,160
It's her.

1227
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:53,360
-I got your poem.
-Sorry?

1228
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:55,440
Your poem--
the one you wrote me.

1229
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:56,840
Poem?

1230
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:06,840
"Oh, desert me,
wretched loneliness...

1231
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:08,520
"and bring me back my love...

1232
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:10,360
"for she and I have parted...

1233
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:12,560
"and the sky is up above."

1234
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:13,720
It worked.

1235
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:15,040
She loves it.

1236
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:22,160
"Your limbs
so svelte and slender..."

1237
01:15:24,240 --> 01:15:26,120
"Your touch...

1238
01:15:26,160 --> 01:15:27,720
"so soft and tender."

1239
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:32,280
"But the bits
that I like best...

1240
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:33,480
"are the bits that..."

1241
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:36,680
I'm not going to read that line.

1242
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:40,200
Jackson, Jackson,
what the hell did you write?

1243
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:41,320
It was a--

1244
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:42,440
Yeah?

1245
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:44,680
A simple poetic reference...

1246
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:46,240
uh, to...

1247
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:47,640
Celine.

1248
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:48,880
Please.

1249
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:50,040
Last verse.

1250
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:54,640
"Just as the flowers blossom...

1251
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:56,600
"in the gaze
of the shining sun..."

1252
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:00,120
"I would be most honored..."

1253
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:03,160
"if you would bear my son."

1254
01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:10,440
Robert, no one has ever
written me a poem before.

1255
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:13,880
All those guys I dated,
they didn't care about me.

1256
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:15,560
They just wanted to own this.

1257
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:16,960
Huh?

1258
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:20,200
I would never open
my heart to any of those guys.

1259
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:22,720
And before I met you...

1260
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:25,240
I never believed
that there was any alternative.

1261
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:28,160
I knew it!

1262
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:30,000
But when you
stopped that bullet...

1263
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:33,120
and got the wrong idea
about Elliot...

1264
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:34,880
I knew it!

1265
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:36,640
I should've understood.

1266
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:38,760
-Celine--
-No. Let me finish.

1267
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:40,680
This is difficult for me
to say...

1268
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:42,800
but I feel I can trust you.

1269
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:44,160
I didn't write the poem.

1270
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:47,160
What?

1271
01:16:47,240 --> 01:16:48,560
I didn't write it.

1272
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:50,080
I've never written a poem
in my life.

1273
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:51,200
How can anybody
be that honest?

1274
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:53,200
It's his handwriting.
Tell him it's his handwriting.

1275
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:54,440
But it's your handwriting.

1276
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:56,040
It--it has this address.

1277
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:59,120
It even has some sort of cheap
aftershave on the paper.

1278
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:01,640
I didn't write the poem, OK?

1279
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:06,480
Oh, my God.

1280
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:08,880
Celine, no need to--

1281
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:17,000
Human fucking beings.

1282
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:18,480
What do you have to do?

1283
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:21,080
We did everything for them!

1284
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:22,800
Brought them together.
Put them in jeopardy.

1285
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:24,720
We damn near killed them both!

1286
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:27,600
We gave them every opportunity.

1287
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:30,280
All they had to do
was fall in love...

1288
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:32,600
and we could've gone home.

1289
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:36,280
Maybe we failed, Jackson...

1290
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:42,280
but we don't have to live
like this.

1291
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:55,320
Is she gone?

1292
01:17:55,400 --> 01:17:56,480
Yeah.

1293
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:58,080
Nice-looking woman.

1294
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:00,720
She isn't my type.

1295
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:06,960
What are you talking about?

1296
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:08,720
Look at yourself.

1297
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:10,320
You're nobody.

1298
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:12,840
You're nothing.

1299
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:16,120
You're wanted in connection
with a violent crime.

1300
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:18,600
You're cleaning the floor
of a diner.

1301
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:23,720
She is an intelligent,
passionate...

1302
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:25,680
beautiful rich woman.

1303
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:31,720
The issue of whether or not
she's your type...

1304
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:33,800
is not one
that you are likely...

1305
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:36,120
to have to resolve
in this world.

1306
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:38,720
She's there watching for me

1307
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:43,640
Or indeed the next, since she
will be going to some heaven...

1308
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:45,400
for glamorous pussy...

1309
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:50,080
and you will be cleaning
the floor of a diner...

1310
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:52,000
in hell.

1311
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:54,880
I guess so.

1312
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:58,560
So why are you even
thinking about it?

1313
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:00,000
I don't know.

1314
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:03,600
Stupid...

1315
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:06,640
Come on.

1316
01:19:06,720 --> 01:19:08,720
Finish the floor.

1317
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:24,200
What the fuck?

1318
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:28,520
Shut up!

1319
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:32,560
Where's my beautiful poem?

1320
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:56,080
Your father’s not home yet.

1321
01:19:56,160 --> 01:19:58,400
I don't expect he'll pay
our ransom straight off.

1322
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:01,000
Not till we send a few fingers
through the mail.

1323
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:04,840
Sixteen.

1324
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:06,880
I'm gonna stick right there.

1325
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:08,800
Say, how about you?

1326
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:14,000
You want a hit?

1327
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:18,960
No.

1328
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,400
Mmm, stay.

1329
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:23,320
-Uh-huh?
-No.

1330
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:25,680
-Hit?
-No!

1331
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:27,600
Now, Miss Naville...

1332
01:20:27,640 --> 01:20:28,800
you've got a five-card trick,
Miss Naville.

1333
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:30,280
you've got a five-card trick,
Miss Naville.

1334
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:31,960
You can stick right there...

1335
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:33,640
and you got
four thousand dollars.

1336
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:34,760
Mm-hmm.

1337
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:36,280
But you want another hit? OK.

1338
01:20:36,360 --> 01:20:37,400
No, no!

1339
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:41,400
-What is that?
-Answer it, Jackson.

1340
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:43,440
I can't do that.
I'm playing blackjack.

1341
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:45,000
She might cheat
while I'm out of the room.

1342
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:50,720
All right.

1343
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:52,960
I'll answer the door.

1344
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:55,040
You play blackjack
with the hostage.

1345
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:03,240
You sure you want
to increase your bet...

1346
01:21:03,320 --> 01:21:04,880
before you take another hit?

1347
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:06,640
No!

1348
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:07,840
No!

1349
01:21:10,520 --> 01:21:11,600
OK.

1350
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:12,760
No!

1351
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:16,400
And...

1352
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:17,760
No!

1353
01:21:27,400 --> 01:21:29,200
Well...

1354
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:33,080
There.

1355
01:21:33,160 --> 01:21:35,120
It's just as well
we're not playing for real.

1356
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:38,640
Come on!

1357
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:44,200
All right, now cut her free.

1358
01:21:47,320 --> 01:21:48,760
What the hell did you do to her?

1359
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:50,160
I punched her in the face.

1360
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:54,120
Oh, you punched her in the face.

1361
01:21:54,160 --> 01:21:56,280
She's half your size,
and you punch her?

1362
01:21:56,360 --> 01:21:58,280
-She had a gun!
-Oh, she had a gun?

1363
01:21:58,360 --> 01:22:00,680
So that makes
everything all right, does it?

1364
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:02,680
I'm not saying
it makes everything all right.

1365
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:04,960
I'm just trying to explain
that for all I knew...

1366
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:07,240
she could have been
a karate expert or something.

1367
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:08,360
With a broken arm?

1368
01:22:08,440 --> 01:22:10,160
With a broken arm?!

1369
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:12,240
OK. I'm sorry.

1370
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:14,160
Now just cut her free!

1371
01:22:25,160 --> 01:22:26,880
You son of a bitch!

1372
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:29,200
-Celine?
-What do you want?

1373
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:31,240
I'm just trying to explain.

1374
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:35,160
Despite your crummy poem...

1375
01:22:35,240 --> 01:22:37,600
I came to see you,
and all you could do...

1376
01:22:37,680 --> 01:22:39,760
was humiliate me
and turn me away.

1377
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:40,840
I thought you were decent.

1378
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:42,920
I thought you were different,
but you're not.

1379
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,360
You're just a lying, cheating
son of a bitch...

1380
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:46,680
just like all the rest!

1381
01:22:46,760 --> 01:22:48,680
Celine,
I never meant to hurt you!

1382
01:22:48,720 --> 01:22:51,080
I don't know
who wrote that poem...

1383
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:53,200
but I'll tell you,
those are my feelings.

1384
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:54,520
Oh, sure.

1385
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:56,160
Not so easy now, huh?

1386
01:22:56,240 --> 01:22:58,840
Celine, Celine!

1387
01:22:58,920 --> 01:23:01,480
When you left the diner
last night...

1388
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:03,280
I realized
I'd turned away the woman...

1389
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:04,720
whom I'd spent the happiest...

1390
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:06,640
most exciting times
of my life with...

1391
01:23:06,720 --> 01:23:09,360
who I care for
more than anyone on the earth!

1392
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:11,800
Listen, listen!

1393
01:23:11,880 --> 01:23:14,360
Do you remember
that dream I had?

1394
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:16,240
I dreamed that my life
was in danger...

1395
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:17,680
that my heart stopped.

1396
01:23:17,720 --> 01:23:19,280
But you saved my life...

1397
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:22,160
when you pierced my heart
with an arrow of your love.

1398
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:25,160
And that's the truth.

1399
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:30,800
Celine, what I'm saying
is that I love you.

1400
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:34,000
What? What did you say?

1401
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:36,720
What I was trying to say
was that I--

1402
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:39,760
Oh, shit.

1403
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:41,480
What?

1404
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:43,480
Who is that?

1405
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:45,080
Don't worry, Miss Celine.

1406
01:23:45,160 --> 01:23:47,360
Everything's going to be
just fine.

1407
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:14,160
Well, we're not just gonna
leave them here, are we?

1408
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:15,640
No, sir.

1409
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:29,920
Come in.

1410
01:24:58,320 --> 01:25:00,360
I don't think
they're coming back.

1411
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:02,600
Isn't there anything you can do?

1412
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:06,320
I don't have the authority
to intervene.

1413
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:10,880
I don't have the authority
to intervene!

1414
01:25:17,720 --> 01:25:20,600
Let me out of this trunk now!

1415
01:25:20,680 --> 01:25:21,800
Robert, he's gonna kill you!

1416
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:24,880
Just run.
He doesn't want the money, OK?

1417
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:26,680
He's gonna kill you!

1418
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:29,360
Just run, Robert, run!

1419
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:31,800
It's probably
in the canoe, Mr. Naville.

1420
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:32,960
That's probably where it is.

1421
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:40,200
It's not in the canoe, sir...

1422
01:25:40,280 --> 01:25:43,600
but I think it's, uh, upstairs.

1423
01:25:43,640 --> 01:25:45,720
I think it's upstairs.
Might've put it there.

1424
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:48,960
They probably left it
under the bed.

1425
01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:50,320
That would be a good place.

1426
01:25:51,720 --> 01:25:54,320
I don't think he has it...

1427
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:55,400
Mr. Naville.

1428
01:25:55,480 --> 01:25:56,720
No. I--

1429
01:25:56,760 --> 01:25:58,200
that's it!

1430
01:25:58,280 --> 01:25:59,920
That's where it is!

1431
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,160
That's where it was.

1432
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:03,120
I put it under that board.

1433
01:26:03,160 --> 01:26:06,680
I'll have your money back to you
in a minute, Mr. Naville, sir.

1434
01:26:06,760 --> 01:26:10,440
Board up, and then
we'll get it back to you.

1435
01:26:11,720 --> 01:26:14,120
We're just gonna have
to face the truth, Robert.

1436
01:26:14,160 --> 01:26:15,920
You don't have my money.

1437
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,720
Yeah, it's down here,
all right, Mr. Naville, sir.

1438
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:19,920
Just where I left it.

1439
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:21,960
And frankly, I don't care.

1440
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,560
It's just a detail.

1441
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:27,080
You'll have your money
back in a second, sir.

1442
01:26:28,440 --> 01:26:30,840
Long as you understand
that it isn't the money.

1443
01:26:30,920 --> 01:26:32,200
It's the principle.

1444
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:42,720
Somebody please
just let me out of here!

1445
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:49,320
Mayhew, not with the ax.

1446
01:26:51,160 --> 01:26:52,720
This is Gabriel.

1447
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:53,880
Get me God.

1448
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:56,960
Let's go. Come on!

1449
01:26:57,040 --> 01:26:59,240
Come on, come on!

1450
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:03,080
Robert, what happened was
you shot them, and then you--

1451
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:07,440
Did he just move?

1452
01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:09,000
No, sir.

1453
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:12,320
In all respect, sir, how could
anything be beyond your control?

1454
01:27:14,640 --> 01:27:16,680
Anyway, you shot them...

1455
01:27:16,720 --> 01:27:18,760
then you shot--

1456
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:21,960
You sure he didn't move?

1457
01:27:22,040 --> 01:27:24,080
I'm quite sure, sir.

1458
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:25,600
Yes, sir.

1459
01:27:25,680 --> 01:27:27,920
No, sir.

1460
01:27:33,960 --> 01:27:35,240
Sir?

1461
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:37,320
Please.

1462
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:39,480
Yeah, quite.

1463
01:27:39,560 --> 01:27:40,680
Yeah, right.

1464
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:44,760
Mayhew, she's moved.

1465
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:46,600
She's moved.

1466
01:27:46,640 --> 01:27:48,120
I saw it with my own eyes.

1467
01:27:48,200 --> 01:27:49,400
Yes, sir.

1468
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:52,840
Thank you, sir.

1469
01:27:52,920 --> 01:27:54,680
They are both dead, sir.

1470
01:27:54,760 --> 01:27:56,520
I shot them myself.

1471
01:27:56,560 --> 01:27:59,080
I won't disturb you again.

1472
01:27:59,160 --> 01:28:00,680
Yahoo!

1473
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:06,360
Who's that?

1474
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:10,120
Robert?

1475
01:28:11,200 --> 01:28:12,360
You shot them...

1476
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:15,200
and then you shot yourself,
and then...

1477
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:17,040
you set fire to this cabin.

1478
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:18,160
Didn't you?

1479
01:28:18,240 --> 01:28:21,160
Not yet, he didn't.

1480
01:28:24,120 --> 01:28:26,160
Celine.

1481
01:28:26,240 --> 01:28:27,720
Why...

1482
01:28:27,760 --> 01:28:31,280
Why don't you just
put that gun down, hmm?

1483
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:33,320
Do not get in my way, father.

1484
01:28:33,400 --> 01:28:36,320
Celine...

1485
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:38,520
you're not responsible
for your actions.

1486
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:39,640
You're unhinged.

1487
01:28:39,720 --> 01:28:43,320
You need the best
psychiatric treatment...

1488
01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:44,680
that money can buy...

1489
01:28:44,720 --> 01:28:46,160
just like your mother.

1490
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:47,600
So why don't you just--

1491
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:54,800
Why don't you just
give me the gun?

1492
01:28:58,640 --> 01:29:00,120
Because as he dreamt...

1493
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:03,880
I shall save his life
with an arrow--

1494
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:07,400
an arrow of my love for him.

1495
01:29:09,320 --> 01:29:10,760
Kill him, Mayhew.

1496
01:29:27,720 --> 01:29:29,400
Ezekiel!

1497
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:42,680
He's alive, Mayhew.

1498
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:46,560
They're all alive.

1499
01:30:29,640 --> 01:30:32,720
So you're telling me
that successful relationships...

1500
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:33,960
are made in heaven?

1501
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:35,720
Not founded
on the daily practicality...

1502
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:37,720
of two people being prepared...

1503
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:40,560
to tolerate the imperfections
of one another?

1504
01:30:40,600 --> 01:30:43,280
It's not successful
relationships, Celine.

1505
01:30:43,320 --> 01:30:46,640
It's love. And it comes from
a strange and wonderful place...

1506
01:30:46,680 --> 01:30:48,120
that we don't know about.

1507
01:30:48,200 --> 01:30:49,960
So you also reject the idea...

1508
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,840
that love is merely
an emotional adaptation...

1509
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:54,720
to a physical necessity?

1510
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:55,880
Completely.

1511
01:30:55,960 --> 01:30:57,560
Are you serious?

1512
01:30:57,640 --> 01:31:00,920
Fate intervenes
in people's lives.

1513
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:02,480
In ours, for instance.

1514
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:04,200
Fate brought us together.

1515
01:31:04,280 --> 01:31:05,600
It kept us together.

1516
01:31:05,680 --> 01:31:08,200
We were destined
for one another.

1517
01:31:09,720 --> 01:31:12,880
Fate had a pretty strange way
of making its point.

1518
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:15,880
But that's
part of the beauty of it.

1519
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:18,160
It's inexplicable,
unpredictable...

1520
01:31:18,200 --> 01:31:21,080
and absolutely beyond control
or understanding.

1521
01:31:21,160 --> 01:31:23,120
But you nearly got killed.

1522
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:24,920
But I didn't...

1523
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,080
and here we are.

1524
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:30,800
Do you have any substantial
evidence to back all this?

1525
01:31:30,840 --> 01:31:31,880
None at all.

1526
01:31:31,960 --> 01:31:34,600
And you realize
that it's absurd and irrational?

1527
01:31:34,640 --> 01:31:36,040
I know that.

1528
01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:38,480
Then why do you believe it?

1529
01:31:38,520 --> 01:31:41,000
Because, Celine, I'm a dreamer.

1530
01:31:43,160 --> 01:31:46,480
Well, I guess
that makes two of us.

1531
01:31:49,200 --> 01:31:50,680
Are you ready?

1532
01:31:50,760 --> 01:31:52,840
As I'll ever be.

1533
01:31:54,120 --> 01:31:55,280
Then let's go.

1534
01:32:58,160 --> 01:32:59,320
All clear.

1535
01:33:09,160 --> 01:33:11,600
So, how was it?

1536
01:33:11,680 --> 01:33:13,400
Believe me, Gabriel.

1537
01:33:13,480 --> 01:33:15,080
You don't want to know.

1538
01:33:15,160 --> 01:33:17,880
-But it worked.
-Yeah.

1539
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:20,840
Love...

1540
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:21,960
worked.

1541
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:26,160
Ameratus pathum laborium.

1542
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:28,080
Are we going home now?

1543
01:33:28,160 --> 01:33:30,280
We're going home.

1544
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:32,080
At last.
