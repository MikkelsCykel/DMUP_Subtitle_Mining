00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,440
The summer I was
8 years old,

2
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,480
5 hours disappeared
from my life.

3
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,960
5 hours.

4
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,320
Lost.

5
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,200
Gone without a trace.

6
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,720
Last thing I remember I was
sitting on the bench...

7
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,120
at my Little League game.

8
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,200
It started to rain.

9
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,040
What happened after that
remains a pitch black void.

10
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:48,800
Brian?

11
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,080
Brian?

12
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,520
You, dork.

13
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,160
What the heck are
you doing in there?

14
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,440
Hey.

15
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,120
You're bleeding.

16
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,360
Whew! It is
terrible out there.

17
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,520
Mom!

18
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,040
Hello, sweetheart.
What happened to you?

19
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,560
Brian got a bloody nose
hiding in the cellar.

20
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,920
Whatever on Earth were
you doing down there?

21
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,520
Are you okay, sweetheart?
You poor little baby.

22
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,800
They had me cooped up all
night in that awful mailroom.

23
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,720
I didn't even know it was
raining till I got off work.

24
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,080
Hold still.

25
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,000
Ow.

26
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,040
Did one of the other moms
give you a ride home?

27
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,560
- I'm going to bed.
- I hope you're happy.

28
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,440
I knew he'd get hurt playing
sports out there in the field.

29
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,880
You know, when I was a kid, I wasn't
exactly a star player either.

30
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,680
But at least I gave it my all,
I wasn't a quitter.

31
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,000
Sorry, Dad.

32
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:54,360
- Good night.
- Good night.

33
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,720
I told your father that
Little League thing...

34
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,840
was a stupid idea.

35
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,120
Hold your nose.

36
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,040
Mom made me quit baseball
the very next day.

37
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,960
This was when
the nightmares began...

38
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,320
...and the nose bleeds.

39
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,040
I wet the bed several times...

40
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,640
...and then there
were the blackouts.

41
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,360
I'd feel my eyes
roll back in my head.

42
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:42,640
I'd crumple to the floor
like a dropped puppet.

43
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,320
The darn thing's not
even a year old yet.

44
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,280
Maybe it's screwed up from
all the lighting last week.

45
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,120
Oh, your father's going to be
overjoyed about this.

46
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,920
What time's Dad getting home?

47
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,960
Not for another hour,
at least, honey.

48
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,640
Mom. Deborah.
Come look!

49
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,560
It's a UFO!

50
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,640
Oh please, it's just a
weather balloon or something.

51
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,480
No, look what it's doing to the TV.

52
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,840
It's flying over the house!

53
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,400
Let's go up on the roof.

54
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,800
No, wait!
Children, be careful!

55
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,720
That summer, those were the
two things I'd never forget.

56
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,920
The cramped, stale
darkness of the crawlspace.

57
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:39,040
And, equal in power
and mystery...that UFO,

58
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:43,200
out there somewhere traveling
across the universe.

59
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:51,000
The summer I was 8 years old,
I came for the first time.

60
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,520
I was watching my Mom going at it
with her boyfriend of the moment,

61
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,760
Alfred, in my old swing set.

62
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:03,680
Alfred was all Marlboro man,
dumb as a fucking rock.

63
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,360
What I would, years later,
come to call "my type".

64
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,120
And only the most boring,
stupid things...

65
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,560
have ever come out of his mouth.

66
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,760
But seeing him like this,
whimpering and grunting...

67
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,640
like a helpless animal, I
couldn't take my eyes off of him.

68
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,240
I'd been masturbating for
years, but it wasn't till...

69
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:42,400
that summer that jizz actually
squirted out my dick when I came.

70
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,080
Couldn't wait to show Coach.

71
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,400
Oh, maybe I should start
at the beginning.

72
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,880
Back in June, my Mom signed
me up for Little League.

73
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,160
It was Alfred's idea, a way
for them to fuck freely,

74
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,120
without the expense
of a sitter.

75
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,000
Are you excited?

76
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,320
Coach Heider?

77
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,040
Desire sledgehammered me.

78
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,400
He looked like the lifeguards,
cowboys and firemen,

79
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:11,040
I'd seen in the Playgirls that my
mom kept stashed under her bed.

80
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,240
Back then, I didn't know
what to do with my feelings.

81
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:17,200
They were like, a gift I had
to open in front of a crowd.

82
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,640
- Hello.
- Hello.

83
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,520
I'm Ellen McCormick.
And this is my son, Neil.

84
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,560
Hello, Neil.

85
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,040
Honey, don't you want to
say hello to your new coach?

86
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:32,440
Don't worry, it takes him a
while to warm up to strangers.

87
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,000
I quickly became the
team's star player.

88
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,440
Which wasn't saying much
considering the other kids...

89
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,680
were a bunch of
hopeless spazzes.

90
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,120
Our first game,
bottom of the eighth,

91
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,360
I whacked a triple
with the bases loaded.

92
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,240
The crowd went fuckin' nuts.

93
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,160
But I didn't care about that.

94
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,040
All that mattered was
it made Coach proud.

95
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,520
After that first victory,
the coach called my Mom...

96
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,360
to tell her he was taking the team
out to a movie to celebrate.

97
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,600
Hey, big guy,
ready to go?

98
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,040
- Coach?
- Yeah.

99
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,880
Where's everybody else?

100
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,640
Well, it looks like it's just going
to be you and me today, bud.

101
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,720
- Really?
- Yup.

102
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,160
Cool.

103
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,080
I picked "Blood Prom," an
R- rated slasher flick...

104
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,280
with tons of cool gore
and murders in it.

105
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,960
When this one really
annoying blonde chick...

106
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,720
got her head chopped off,
I cheered.

107
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,160
After the movie, we
we picked up a pizza...

108
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,480
and headed back to Coach's.

109
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,080
Coach's house was awesome.

110
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:40,840
He had a giant TV, an Atari with
Donkey Kong, Asteroids, Frogger.

111
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,280
All my favorite games.

112
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,000
Hah. You exploded.
My turn.

113
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,000
Sure your mom's
not expecting you?

114
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,440
No.
She works.

115
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,080
She's probably got a date
with Alfred afterward.

116
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,400
My guess is you spend a lot
of time by yourself, huh?

117
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,040
Yeah.
But I kind of like it.

118
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,240
I just ride my
bike and watch TV.

119
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,280
It's cool.

120
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,040
Oh shit!
You made me mess up!

121
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,080
Sorry.

122
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,240
Hold on.

123
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,840
Come here for a sec.

124
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,160
Bring one of those
bottles of Peach Nehi.

125
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,960
Now, this might seem a
little weird at first.

126
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,520
But I need to record
my team's voices,

127
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,240
especially my best players.

128
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,720
Okay?

129
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,920
Take this.

130
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:45,200
Now just speak into it
using your normal voice.

131
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,000
Well, what should I say?

132
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,520
Whatever you like.

133
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,080
Start with your name.

134
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,640
Neil.

135
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:56,840
Now take a big sip
of pop and belch.

136
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,520
Shit.

137
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:01,920
Good.

138
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,440
Say that again.

139
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,840
Shit.

140
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,640
Again.

141
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,320
Shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit.

142
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,600
Shit.

143
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,960
Hell!

144
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:13,760
Damn!

145
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,840
Now, look up
into the camera.

146
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,240
Now stick your tongue out.

147
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,520
Make a funny face.

148
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,720
Good. Good.

149
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,480
Yeah.

150
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,680
Yes, Neil, yes.

151
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,600
Yes.

152
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,840
Open your mouth real wide.

153
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,040
Neil, that's perfect.

154
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,520
July 2nd.

155
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,120
We had a 7:30 game against
Hutchinson Taco Hut.

156
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,080
I know you're gonna kick
their butts tonight?

157
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,840
You gonna knock one out
of the park for your poor,

158
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,160
hard-working mom?

159
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,080
So you're gonna get a ride
home with Coach, right?

160
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,400
- Yeah.
- Okay.

161
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,800
You're mine and I love you
and don't you ever forget it.

162
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,040
Boy, were you
on fire tonight!

163
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,560
It's the best
you've ever played!

164
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,360
Thanks, Coach.

165
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,160
Hey, can we play some more of
those game cartridges tonight?

166
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,400
Sure we can.

167
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,920
But I gotta show
you something first.

168
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,560
Ew.
I look stupid in this one.

169
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,680
No.

170
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,360
You look perfect.
Your expression.

171
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,280
Like you're having
a wonderful dream.

172
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,560
Neil, I've been thinking
a lot about you this week.

173
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,800
I'm hungry.

174
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,400
Sure.

175
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,440
You want a pizza?

176
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,280
I might have something
here you'd like.

177
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,400
Whoa!

178
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,440
What'll it be, little buddy?

179
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,240
My mom never buys
these things.

180
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,880
She says they're a
big waste of money.

181
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Let's eat then.

182
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,520
Which one do you want?

183
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,200
I don't know,
what are you having?

184
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,440
Corn pops.

185
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,680
Then I'll have uh...

186
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,080
Cocoa Krispies.

187
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,680
Shit.

188
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,000
Sorry.

189
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,680
You do one.

190
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,200
Whew!

191
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,480
Here we go.

192
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,560
I like you, Neil.

193
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,200
I like you so much.

194
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,720
When I really, really
like someone...

195
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,200
...there's a way I
show them how I feel.

196
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,000
Shhh.

197
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:29,360
Angel.

198
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:32,160
There's nothing wrong with
kissing someone like this.

199
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:35,640
Don't ever let anyone
tell you that it's wrong.

200
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,000
It happened.

201
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,760
That's what I told myself.

202
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,720
It just happened.

203
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,640
And after it was over,
I looked down...

204
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,360
at the mess on the floor.

205
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,040
It was like a kaleidoscope
had shattered.

206
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:01,360
And when I swallowed, the taste
of Coach's tongue seared my mouth.

207
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,080
You liked it.

208
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,680
It's okay that you liked it.

209
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,640
Everything's gonna be okay.

210
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,480
Do you know him
or something?

211
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,400
I met Wendy Peterson
when I was ten.

212
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,000
She was eleven, one grade
ahead of me in school.

213
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,080
What are you doing?

214
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,480
Damn. No razor.

215
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,720
You're insane.

216
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,920
If I wasn't queer we would
have ended up having...

217
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,080
sloppy teenage sex and
getting pregnant...

218
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,320
contributing more fucked up,
unwanted kids to society.

219
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:58,080
But instead, she
became my soulmate.

220
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:01,560
And...one true
partner in crime.

221
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,040
Let's kidnap him.

222
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,160
His mom says we're
supposed to take him home.

223
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,600
Where are you taking me?

224
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,320
A house with lots
and lots of candy.

225
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,840
Goody.

226
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:22,480
Beeewaaaaaaare.
Bewaaaare.

227
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,200
Bewaaare.

228
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:29,600
These are the eyes of the
Axe Murderer's victims.

229
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,880
- Come on, Satan.
- Hurry up, Chicken.

230
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,120
I never much cared
for Halloween,

231
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,440
but this particular year,
I couldn't shake the feeling...

232
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,880
that something
horrible was gonna happen.

233
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,800
And there was nothing
I could do to stop it.

234
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,480
Wait outside for me.
I'll be done in a minute.

235
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,480
You hold him while
I go get something.

236
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,920
- What are we gonna do?
- Have some fun.

237
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,560
- What's the matter, Satan?
- What did you say, Punk?

238
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,280
What a loser!

239
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,200
Loser!

240
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,960
Loser!

241
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:36,800
Brian?

242
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,560
Brian?

243
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,840
I thought that was you.

244
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,760
Lie down.

245
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,800
Lie down, retard.

246
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,080
What are you doing?

247
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,480
Shut up!
Shut up, or we'll kill you.

248
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,120
Point the beam over here.

249
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,640
Open your mouth.

250
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,040
I said open your mouth.

251
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,880
Keep these in your
fucking mouth.

252
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,480
You better do what we say,
or I'll kill you, I swear.

253
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,480
Give me the matches.

254
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,280
Wendy, come on, give me
the damn matches!

255
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,320
Shine the flashlight on him.

256
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,600
Neil, he's gonna tattle!

257
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,640
Don't worry.
I know what to do.

258
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,840
There are things we can
do to get him on our side.

259
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,400
That's it.

260
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,920
Just lay still for a minute.

261
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,640
You're my little green buddy
and there's this cool thing...

262
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,800
I wanna show you.

263
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,120
When I was little, a man
used to do this to me.

264
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,440
You're really gonna like it.

265
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,320
There.
That's it.

266
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,280
That's my boy.

267
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:03,120
Wendy never looked at me
quite the same after that night.

268
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,960
Sharing this part of myself...

269
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,400
I'd never showed
anyone else ever before.

270
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:12,200
I knew we'd be bound
together...forever.

271
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,080
I woke up, once again not
knowing where I was...

272
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,040
or what had happened to me.

273
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,240
By the time I
made my way back,

274
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,800
Deborah said I'd been
missing for over an hour.

275
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,800
But I couldn't
remember a thing.

276
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,720
All I knew was that it was somehow
linked to the other time,

277
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,240
the night I
woke up in the cellar.

278
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,320
And I also knew that,
no matter how long it took,

279
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,840
I had to find out what
had happened to me.

280
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,240
I had to find an
answer to the mystery.

281
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,880
When I was 15, I overheard some
kids at school talking about a place.

282
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:51,520
A place that you could find even in
a dumbass hicktown like Hutchinson.

283
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,080
Bingo.

284
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,440
Here we go.

285
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,920
- How's it going?
- Okay.

286
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,200
- I'm Charlie.
- Neil.

287
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,520
Wanna go for a ride?

288
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:03,640
Sure.

289
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,320
You got cash?

290
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,880
I'll pay 50, no higher.

291
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,680
You've got to be
careful out here.

292
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,520
The cops patrol this
whole entire area,

293
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,920
and they've got brains
enough to know what's up.

294
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,880
I'm in Hutchinson
on business.

295
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,240
I supply snack foods
to the local markets.

296
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,480
Go ahead.

297
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,800
Take whatever you want.

298
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,800
Hungry, huh?

299
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:48,680
We've only got an hour,
so we'd better get busy.

300
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,600
Wait.

301
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,360
Let me.

302
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,560
Beautiful.

303
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,360
So, what do you like to do?

304
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,000
Tell me what you
want me to do.

305
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,720
Whatever.

306
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,760
You like older guys, huh?

307
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,120
Tell me.

308
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,680
Yeah.

309
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,440
That feels nice.

310
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:51,360
You are such a beautiful,
beautiful boy.

311
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,440
I'm gonna come.

312
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,960
I'm gonna come.

313
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,920
I know what you're thinking.

314
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,640
That wasn't safe.

315
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,520
But we're in
Kansas, thank God,

316
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,120
not some big city
full of diseases.

317
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,720
Plus, you're only a kid.

318
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,440
Boo.

319
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,400
Maniac.

320
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,800
You scared me!

321
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,800
Thanks for meeting me.

322
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,520
Yeah, well,
This better be good.

323
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:58,040
My mom will kill me if she
finds out I snuck out this late.

324
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,400
I have something
I wanna show you.

325
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,520
Ew.

326
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:14,960
Look.

327
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,960
Yeah. So?

328
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,920
That's me.

329
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,080
You're such a liar.

330
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,280
I don't believe you.

331
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,240
I'll prove it.

332
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,720
Okay. How?

333
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,360
Oh, my God, what are you...

334
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,000
Put that back in your
pants, exhibitionist!

335
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:41,800
Look.

336
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,840
No way, perv.

337
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,360
Look what the guy did to me.

338
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,560
Are those bruises?

339
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,640
Fucker gnawed on my dick like
it was a fucking candy cane.

340
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,200
I didn't even realize he was hurting
me till after I blew my load.

341
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,080
Well, you better
watch out, McCormick.

342
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,680
Next time someone might
chomp the whole thing off.

343
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,640
Seriously.

344
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,800
Even Hutchinson has
its share of freaks.

345
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,400
You trick with the wrong guy and
I'd find pieces of you everywhere.

346
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,720
Okay, "Mom".

347
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:23,120
I wish there's a movie
showing right now.

348
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,160
Me too.

349
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,360
A film about our lives.

350
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,400
Everything's that's
happened so far.

351
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,960
And the last scene would just
be us standing right here.

352
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,480
Just you and me.

353
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,920
Yeah.

354
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,640
I hear something.

355
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,440
It's the voice of God.

356
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,760
I hear him.

357
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,720
I hear him.

358
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,480
Mom!

359
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,120
It's about to begin.

360
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,640
Alright, I'm coming.

361
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,120
VCR on?

362
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,760
I checked it twice.

363
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:55,280
It's probably going
to be a little silly.

364
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,520
The commercial showed this
crazy old man claiming...

365
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:00,160
aliens beamed him up right
out of his bathtub.

366
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,800
If you're going to make fun,
I'd just as soon watch by myself.

367
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,000
Shh, it's starting.

368
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,440
Tonight on "World
Of Mystery",

369
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:15,120
we investigate the
terrifying world of UFOs.

370
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:19,280
Is it mass hysteria or
something all too real?

371
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,640
They kept me
prisoner for hours.

372
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:27,360
They examined me like I was
a frog in biology class.

373
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,600
And then they stuck a
probe in my stomach.

374
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,040
I still got the scar
here to prove it.

375
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,880
Look at that.

376
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,680
I always got scared anytime
I watched movies about UFOs.

377
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,960
Even "E.T." scared me.

378
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,360
Poor thing.

379
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,400
She looks so homely and sad.

380
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:52,120
Avalyn Friesen lives in the tiny,
ordinary town of Inman, Kansas.

381
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,480
Inman?

382
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,760
That's only 30 miles away.

383
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,160
32 years old,
she is unmarried.

384
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,440
Lives with her father
and works part-time...

385
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,880
as a secretary.

386
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,640
But there is something
unusual about Avalyn.

387
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,160
For as long as
she can remember,

388
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:09,640
things have happened to her,
things she cannot explain.

389
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,800
I'd heard about people who've
experienced missing time.

390
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:16,400
Whole chunks of their lives
they couldn't account for.

391
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:19,520
Under hypnotic regression
I learned that...

392
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:22,280
I had been abducted
more than 20 times.

393
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,560
Oh, please!

394
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,400
Quiet.

395
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,400
The first time
was when I was 6.

396
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,760
I was on my way home from a
picnic with my grandparents.

397
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:33,360
It was dark and we got lost,
driving down a dirt road.

398
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,720
Grandpa lost control of the
car and we went into a ditch.

399
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,200
There was this
blinding white light.

400
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,800
But the aliens weren't
interested in my grandparents.

401
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,200
They floated me up
out of the car...

402
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:48,440
using some sort
of gravitational ray.

403
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,520
That's it.
I've had enough.

404
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,720
I'm gonna get some ice cream.

405
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,000
- Want some?
- No, thanks.

406
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,920
I remember lying on a table.

407
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
It was cold,
smooth and shiny.

408
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,720
The aliens surrounded me.

409
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:07,760
They were bald with huge
marshmallowy heads and tiny arms.

410
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:10,840
But the worst part
was their eyes.

411
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:13,120
The only way I can
describe them is big,

412
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,440
black diamonds,
all liquidy and jellyish.

413
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:44,040
I can't believe I'm finally getting
out of this fucking nowhere town!

414
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,720
You better let me know
the second you're settled.

415
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,280
Or else.

416
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:53,040
You better come.
Or else.

417
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,160
New York City.

418
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,680
You're so lucky!

419
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,840
Hey, assface.

420
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,680
What you gawking at?

421
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,280
Faggots!

422
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,640
Shit, go, go, go!

423
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,760
Fuck you!

424
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,200
Remember the guy I told
you about last week?

425
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,320
White Camaro?

426
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,720
That's him.
Parked by those trees.

427
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,880
I've fucked every single
john in this park.

428
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,800
Except for White Camaro.

429
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,600
So it's time for
you two to get lost.

430
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,320
Stop scaring my
business away.

431
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,440
You want us to come
pick you up later?

432
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,600
Yeah, if you want.

433
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,320
I'll be done by, like, 7.

434
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,840
We'll meet you.

435
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,400
Speak for yourself, Eric.

436
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,880
I gotta get home
and start packing.

437
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:03,760
Alright, call me tonight.

438
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,720
I'll see you later.

439
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,920
You better be careful.

440
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,560
Of what?

441
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,600
I'm serious, Eric.

442
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,480
You're not in
Modesto anymore.

443
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,440
I see the way
you look at him.

444
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,000
He's so beautiful.

445
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,080
I can't help it.

446
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,200
He's like a god.

447
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:35,000
You don't have to tell me, I
was infatuated with him too once.

448
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,720
But I know all Neil's secrets
and there's shit there...

449
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,320
you don't even want
to know about.

450
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,960
Trust me.

451
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,360
Once I'm gone, you'll
be all Neil has...

452
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,800
and you have to
understand one thing.

453
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,320
Where normal people
have a heart,

454
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:51,320
Neil McCormick's has a
bottomless black hole.

455
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:56,080
And if you don't watch out, you can
fall in and get lost forever.

456
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,280
Ahh.

457
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,440
Brian?
Brian, you home?

458
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,480
Yeah, Mom.
In here.

459
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,800
No class today?

460
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:45,280
I've got English Comp
discussion group at 7:30.

461
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,840
You have mail.

462
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,360
Looks like one
from your sister.

463
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,440
And one from "A. Friesen"?

464
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,800
I can't believe
she wrote me back.

465
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,040
Who?

466
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:00,080
Avalyn Friesen.
The woman on TV.

467
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:03,040
She didn't have to dump a whole
gallon of perfume on it, did she?

468
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,480
What did she say?

469
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,560
She wants me to
visit her in Inman.

470
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,160
Thanks for the ride, Preston.

471
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:37,640
Later.

472
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,280
You just missed it, sweetie.

473
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:48,440
This little old lady
just won both showcases.

474
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,480
What did she get?

475
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:57,280
She got a trip to Scotland,
beautiful living room set,

476
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,760
a brand new car.

477
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,200
I can't remember the name of
it but it cost over 27 grand.

478
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,560
Are you wearing cologne?

479
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,280
Was work okay?

480
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,600
It was the pits.

481
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,640
When is our ship
gonna come in, huh baby?

482
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,640
Soon, Ma.

483
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,800
Soon.

484
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,440
Oh, Neil, don't forget.

485
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,640
Tomorrow's my date.
That hot Italian.

486
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,520
The guy who always comes
through my checkout lane.

487
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,400
Don't worry, because
I'll be at work.

488
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,360
It's the last tournament
of the season.

489
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,840
Vincenzo.

490
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,680
Brian!

491
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,720
Brian, hey!

492
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,520
Patches!
Patches, down.

493
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,280
Sorry, she gets a
little excited.

494
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:36,120
Hi, you must be Brian.
I'm Avalyn, obviously.

495
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,320
Dad?
It's okay, Daddy.

496
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,640
This is the young man
I was telling you about.

497
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Don't mind him.

498
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,120
He's just a little
wary of strangers.

499
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:50,120
I'm so glad you're here.
Come on.

500
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,680
It isn't showy, but it's home.
Here, have a seat.

501
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,280
Have you eaten?
I was just in the middle of lunch.

502
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:02,000
- I hope you don't mind.
- No, go ahead. I ate earlier.

503
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,640
So, you saw the show?

504
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:07,840
Several times.
I videotaped it.

505
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:11,640
They left some stuff out, but they
managed to get the major points across.

506
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,760
I think I was taken too.

507
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,520
You mentioned that
in your letter.

508
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,920
You're at the point I
was a few years ago,

509
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,760
where you're just starting
to remember things.

510
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,160
There are many of us and
we all have this drive...

511
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,560
to know what happened.

512
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:29,920
So...you think that's
what happened to me.

513
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,960
Just from what I told you
about the missing time and...

514
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,480
I'm sure of it.

515
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,920
Feel like going on a walk?

516
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,680
What's that you're carrying?

517
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,000
It's a Dream Journal.

518
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,520
I keep a log of
all my dreams.

519
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,560
Whatever bits and pieces
I can recall at least.

520
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:53,440
I feel like it's slowly
helping me remember.

521
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,840
That's a really good idea.

522
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,440
Your subconscious is where
all your memories are buried.

523
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,040
For you and me and people
like us almost every...

524
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:03,000
single thing we do stems
from our being abducted.

525
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,600
Come here, I want to show you
something they wouldn't allow...

526
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,080
on "World of Mystery".

527
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,320
I've been tagged.

528
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,160
Part of their experiments.

529
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,400
Touch it.

530
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,240
When I was taken,
my leg was bleeding,

531
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,760
but I didn't remember
being cut, nothing.

532
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:26,800
Then, under hypnosis is when
I discovered that's where...

533
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,760
they implant the
tracking device.

534
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,880
Now everything
I do, they know.

535
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,440
In fact, I wouldn't be
surprised if they were...

536
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,640
spying on us right now.

537
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:39,200
When I was found that
night, my nose was bleeding.

538
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:43,120
The old up-the-nose trick,
so the scar can't be seen.

539
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,840
Don't forget to write.

540
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,400
Don't you forget
what I told you.

541
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,800
Okay.

542
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:00,280
You better come see
me soon, asshole.

543
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,440
I will.

544
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,200
I will.

545
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,240
Stay out of trouble, you two.

546
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,720
Bye.

547
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,400
I can't believe it's so late.
My mom's gonna worry.

548
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,960
You still live with your mom?

549
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,720
My dad moved out 7 years ago.

550
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,440
I don't see him much.

551
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:04,160
You wanna read me
one of your dreams?

552
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:08,120
I just, you know, scribble them
out in the middle of the night.

553
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,800
Sometimes I can
barely even read them.

554
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,000
That's okay.

555
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,520
This is from 2 nights ago.

556
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,680
"There's a blue light.

557
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,160
I'm in my Little
League uniform,

558
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,480
and a tall alien is
hovering over me."

559
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:40,720
"Someone else is with me.
Another boy, also in uniform."

560
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,880
"Panther?"

561
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,640
That was the name
of my baseball team.

562
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,240
Let's see, uh...

563
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:58,000
"The alien has big black eyes.
He's touching my face."

564
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:02,480
"I want to cry out
for help, but..."

565
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:07,800
"I can't. I can't."

566
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:10,840
You're on your way to
uncovering the truth.

567
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:13,320
Think of yourself as a
detective, following clues.

568
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,720
Maybe concentrate on the
other boy in your dreams,

569
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,200
he could help you find the
answers you're looking for.

570
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,440
Two outs.

571
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,760
Third baseman Jackson up,
with Hinton..

572
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:25,720
on deck.

573
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,080
Jesus.
Check out that Jackson.

574
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,560
Hubba hubba.

575
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,960
Ew...

576
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,480
are you joking?

577
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,600
No, I'd fuck him for free.

578
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,760
Please return all foul
balls to pressbox.

579
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:41,720
Thank you.

580
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,000
You don't think
Jackson's hot?

581
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:48,320
Dude, he's fat and bald!

582
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,840
Different folks,
different strokes.

583
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,440
My Daddy hit this.

584
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,800
Well, come here, come on in,
collect your prize.

585
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,400
Thank you so much.
One second...

586
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,600
Alright...
what will it be, big guy?

587
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,240
Cash or bubbles?

588
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,800
You can't decide.
Alright, hold out your hand.

589
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,000
- Thanks!
- You're welcome.

590
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,400
See you later.

591
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,200
What?

592
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,200
When kids do good,
you gotta reward them.

593
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,200
Oh, Christ.

594
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,920
It's Hinton,
a.k.a. "Ass of the Gods".

595
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,240
I am so, fucking wasted!

596
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,360
Oh, shit!

597
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,360
- Where's your mom?
- I don't know.

598
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:43,800
She's probably out with her
new boyfriend, Vincenzo.

599
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:51,040
I've got a wicked headache.

600
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:54,000
- Do you have any pot?
- Yeah. Come on.

601
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,680
Here.
Knock yourself out.

602
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:12,640
There's a porno in the
VCR if you wanna jack off.

603
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:14,760
Thanks.

604
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,040
You got a lighter?

605
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,560
Yeah. Here.

606
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:10,240
You like that?

607
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:11,880
It tickles a little.

608
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,400
That feels good,
doesn't it, Neil?

609
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:15,800
Mm-hmm.

610
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,880
Can we put the blanket over our
heads like we did last time?

611
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:22,520
Here we go.

612
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:30,600
Find what you
were looking for?

613
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:34,120
Yeah.
Thanks a lot.

614
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:35,480
Glad I could help out.

615
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:38,000
I used to write for
my school paper too,

616
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:39,400
back in the day.

617
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,120
Well, this will really make a
big difference in my article.

618
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,160
Maybe you'll win
a Pulitzer Prize.

619
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:45,360
Maybe.

620
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,960
Just let me know if there's
anything else you need.

621
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:49,480
Thanks so much.

622
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,280
You done already?

623
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:04,600
I'm on kind of a
tight deadline.

624
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,280
Well, good luck.

625
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:09,360
That's two outs.
Garfield the batter...

626
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:10,560
Heim on deck.

627
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,720
Scoot your chair back
a little further.

628
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:20,600
That's better.

629
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:32,680
Wait.
Hold on a sec.

630
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,840
And at the end of 3
innings, the score is...

631
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,600
Hutchinson First
National Bank, 3;

632
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,880
Wichita Coleman
lndustries, 0.

633
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:41,440
Okay. Go on.

634
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,080
Where have you been?

635
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:49,960
Sorry.
I should've called.

636
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:51,680
I didn't realize the time.

637
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,880
Well, your dinner's
cold as ice.

638
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,560
That's okay.

639
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,840
Brian, what's going on?

640
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,800
You've been acting
so strangely.

641
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:02,280
Disappearing for hours.

642
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:04,000
It's just school, Mom.

643
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:06,000
College is way different
than high school.

644
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:07,760
Did you ever call
your father back?

645
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:09,560
I've been busy.

646
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,200
I'll get it.
You finish your dinner.

647
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:15,000
Hello?

648
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:16,400
Yes.

649
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:18,320
He's eating his
supper right now.

650
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,800
- Who is it?
- It's that UFO woman.

651
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:23,360
I'll get it in the hall.

652
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:26,640
Got it.

653
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:30,440
Brian?

654
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:32,000
I was just going
to call you.

655
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:33,680
I found a photo of the boy.

656
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,480
The one from my dreams.

657
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:36,760
That's amazing.

658
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:38,080
What are you
doing right now?

659
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:39,720
Nothing.

660
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:41,000
There's something
I need to show you.

661
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:42,920
Something important.
Can you come out here?

662
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,640
Sure.

663
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:48,240
Hi, honey.
How was work?

664
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:49,480
Fuck you.

665
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:04,840
I'm so fuckin' sick of this
stinky little buttcrack of a town!

666
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:21,400
Patches, shhh, quiet!

667
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:22,560
You'll wake Daddy.

668
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,280
Brian!
Thanks for coming.

669
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:26,040
No problem.

670
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,760
I stole this from the
Hutchinson Chamber of Commerce.

671
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:32,560
That's him.
The boy from my dreams.

672
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:33,960
Look at his face.

673
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:36,040
It's almost like you can
tell he knows something.

674
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:39,720
What are you doing?

675
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:48,640
"N. McCormick."

676
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:50,320
You can start looking for
him first thing tomorrow morning.

677
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,320
Maybe he still
lives in Hutchinson.

678
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:55,760
Meanwhile, I have to show you
something only you will understand.

679
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:03,320
I've fucked every single guy and
his ugly uncle in this podunk town.

680
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,680
Twice.

681
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:13,120
You want one?

682
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:16,200
One of us has to drive.

683
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,640
I got a postcard from Wendy.

684
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:25,040
I think she's mad at me
because I owe her like 3 letters.

685
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:26,880
Yeah, her last P.S. is...

686
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,360
"Tell Fuckface
to write me".

687
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:30,640
So you wanna hear
what she says?

688
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:35,720
"Hey, ass.

689
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:38,600
So New York is insane and
crazy in the best possible way".

690
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:39,240
Pardon me.

691
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:42,640
Can we help you?

692
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:45,240
I was wondering if I might
buy you boys a drink.

693
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:46,840
Fuck off.

694
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,240
You heard me, fag.

695
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:52,320
Fuck...off.

696
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,600
Stuck up little pricks.

697
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:56,360
Harsh.

698
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:58,000
Wasn't he kinda your type?

699
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:01,480
I hate it when they look like
Tarzan and sound like Jane.

700
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:03,440
Let's get out of
this shithole.

701
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,400
But we just got here!

702
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:10,200
Patches.
Patches!

703
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:12,240
Patches, get
away from there!

704
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,160
Farmers have been finding
mutilated cattle like this...

705
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:18,720
around here for years.

706
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:22,640
I told "World of Mystery", but
they conveniently edited it out.

707
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:24,920
Daddy says it's just a bunch
of "Satan worshippers"...

708
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:26,880
going around chopping up cows.

709
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:29,200
Ha! Come here.

710
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:30,640
Let me see your hand.

711
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,200
Feel that?

712
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:35,760
Its sex organs.

713
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:37,640
They're gone.

714
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:40,000
The aliens, they experiment
on cattle because the...

715
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:41,880
poor things are so defenseless.

716
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:43,880
Us, on the other hand,
they can't kill us,

717
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:45,720
so they just leave behind
the hidden memories...

718
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:46,920
of what they've done.

719
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:49,240
Which in a way
is almost worse.

720
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:51,280
Notice anything
else strange?

721
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:52,880
There's no blood.

722
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,480
They took that, too.

723
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:05,840
Brian?

724
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:07,280
Oh, my God, Brian!

725
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:10,400
Brian!

726
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:16,960
Here we go.

727
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,640
Oh, my God.
Brian.

728
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:20,960
Tell him you like it.

729
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:23,400
Brian!

730
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:24,920
Oh, Brian, are you okay?

731
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,320
Oh, God.

732
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:27,160
Brian?

733
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:29,200
Brian!

734
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,280
Neil. What are you doing?

735
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:35,840
Come on.
It's 2:30 in the morning.

736
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:41,840
You called me
your fucking...angel.

737
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:47,760
Are you sure Wendy's going
to meet you at the station?

738
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:49,680
I don't want you getting
lost in that crazy city.

739
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,160
Ma, you don't have
to worry, okay?

740
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:53,440
Call me collect the
minute you arrive.

741
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:54,520
- Promise me.
- Okay.

742
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:55,840
Promise me, Neil.

743
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:57,320
Okay.

744
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,560
We should've at least gotten
you a decent hair cut.

745
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:08,120
I have to take a piss.

746
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:09,520
Preston?

747
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:11,920
We'll be right back.

748
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:16,640
- Fuck, man!
- What's the matter?

749
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:17,760
I don't know.

750
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:21,120
My fucking dick itches
like motherfucking fuck!

751
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:23,800
What do you want
me to do about it?

752
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,360
Just look down there.

753
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:28,040
Preston, come on,
help me out here.

754
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:31,920
What the fuck's
wrong with me?

755
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:36,800
Dude.
You've got crabs.

756
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,160
I mean, it's no big, man.

757
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:44,880
You just go to the drug store
and get this stuff called Rid.

758
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:49,720
You better be
playing safe.

759
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:50,880
I stay in control.

760
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,560
Honey, your bus is boarding.

761
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:55,600
Alright.

762
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:04,920
My baby.

763
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:06,800
You're all grown up.

764
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:13,360
You gonna be careful?

765
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,320
Yeah, I will.

766
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:24,680
You're mine and I love you.
Don't you ever forget it.

767
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:47,880
Come on.
I'll buy you Dairy Queen.

768
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:50,720
So what are you gonna
do now that Neil's gone?

769
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:54,040
- Kill myself, I guess.
- Eric, that is not funny.

770
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:57,160
Well, I start Hutchinson
Community College next week.

771
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:59,680
Really?
That's so wonderful.

772
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:01,560
Pathetic is more like it.

773
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,280
Well, you know you are
always welcome to come over...

774
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:05,560
to the house, even
without Neil around.

775
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:09,120
Thanks, Mrs. M. I may
just take you up on that.

776
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:10,320
You better.

777
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,600
Who the hell is that?

778
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,840
Incognito Boy Scout?

779
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:26,800
Can I help you?

780
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:30,120
- Is this your house?
- Yes.

781
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:32,320
I'm really sorry
to bother you,

782
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:34,840
but I got your address
out of the phonebook.

783
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,760
I've spent the whole
afternoon checking every...

784
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:40,000
McCormick in Hutchinson and
you're the last one on my list.

785
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:42,000
Anyway, I don't
mean to babble...

786
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:43,680
What do you want?

787
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:47,360
I'm looking for an N. McCormick.

788
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:48,920
Are you FBl?

789
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:52,440
Sorry honey, but it looks
like you are shit outta luck.

790
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:56,000
You mean there's no
N. McCormick living here?

791
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:59,760
I mean we just put him on
a bus headed for New York City.

792
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:05,560
I'm Neil's friend, Eric,
and this is his Mom.

793
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:09,920
"Neil"?
His name is Neil?

794
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,120
Yeah.

795
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:16,520
I'm Brian.
Brian Lackey.

796
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:29,120
So you still
haven't written.

797
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:30,440
Big surprise.

798
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:32,600
But Wendy says you're
doing okay, which is cool.

799
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:34,680
I've been wanting to tell
you about this strange guy...

800
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:36,200
I met 3 weeks ago.

801
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:37,600
No, we're not fucking.

802
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:39,720
Get your mind out
of the gutter, perv.

803
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:41,520
He's not even gay,
I don't think.

804
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:45,160
In fact, his vibe is
kinda weirdly asexual.

805
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:46,640
His name is Brian Lackey.

806
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:48,400
He lives in Little River
and, like yours truly,

807
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:50,960
attends Hutchinson
Loser Community College.

808
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:52,720
Anyways, the day you left...

809
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:55,280
...your mom and I found him
literally on your doorstep,

810
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:56,400
looking for you.

811
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:58,240
He says you and him played
Little League together...

812
00:55:58,320 --> 00:55:59,600
like 10 years ago.

813
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:02,800
He was the worst player on the
team, blah, blah, blah...

814
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:04,560
He's full of
questions about you.

815
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:06,520
But, of course, I
haven't told him much,

816
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:09,000
i.e. about your
"line of work".

817
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:10,440
I did say you were
queer like me,

818
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:12,480
only because I figured
you wouldn't care.

819
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:15,360
But now, are you ready
for the good part?

820
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:17,280
He thinks that when you
and him were little...

821
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:20,760
...you were both abducted
and examined by space aliens.

822
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,640
How brilliant is that?

823
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:24,960
But he was completely
serious when he told me this.

824
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:27,160
Like you should've seen
the look in his eyes.

825
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:28,720
So, what's the story, dude?

826
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:31,920
Were you abducted
by a UFO or what?

827
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:34,480
P.S. - Are your crabs gone yet?

828
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:44,560
- Brian?
- Yeah?

829
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:49,000
- You have a visitor.
- Hi Brian.

830
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:51,040
I was just in the neighborhood
and I thought I'd stop by,

831
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:52,160
see how you're doing.

832
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,520
I'll be in the front
room if you need me.

833
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:57,880
Thanks, Mom.

834
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:03,600
Didn't care for that film.

835
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:05,440
That, I didn't see.

836
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:08,240
Your Mom doesn't
like me very much.

837
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:10,600
She thinks I'm trying
to steal you away.

838
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:13,280
Any luck in your
search for "N. McCormick"?

839
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:16,240
I met his mom and
his best friend,

840
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:18,480
but he's in New York right now.

841
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:20,600
New York. Really?

842
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:25,000
Here. Sit down.

843
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:33,560
Had any more of
those dreams?

844
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:35,480
Yeah.

845
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:38,840
But they seem to
be slowly evolving.

846
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:41,000
Maybe it's just because I've
been spending a lot of time...

847
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:43,920
with Eric, Neil's friend.

848
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:47,440
But it's becoming clearer
and clearer that he...

849
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:51,720
Neil that is, is a
key figure in all this.

850
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:54,280
Like he was there with me
the night it all happened.

851
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:00,120
I can't.

852
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:01,560
I can't.

853
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:02,840
Don't. No.

854
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,440
I can't.

855
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:06,400
It's okay.

856
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:09,040
No. No.
Don't.

857
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:10,160
It'll feel good.

858
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:11,080
Don't!

859
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:14,640
I'm sorry.

860
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:15,880
You better go.

861
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:18,360
Please.

862
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:20,200
I'm sorry, Brian.

863
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:37,840
I pay 120.
Not a cent more.

864
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:40,280
Okay.

865
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:42,080
Shall we?

866
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:27,800
Fuck me!

867
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:31,720
Fuck me up the ass with
your hot, teenaged cock!

868
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:38,360
Wait!

869
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:39,800
What the fuck are you doing?

870
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:49,320
Okay.
Whatever.

871
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:53,400
I'll put it on for you.

872
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:00,320
There.

873
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:06,920
Well, come on, stud.
We're on the clock here.

874
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:41,240
We're not in Kansas
anymore, Neil.

875
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:43,680
You have got to
be so careful.

876
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:46,240
I know.

877
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:49,000
Don't "I know" me,
Neil McCormick.

878
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:51,280
This is New York City.

879
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:54,480
You do the wrong thing with
the wrong person and you die.

880
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:56,800
Period.
End of story.

881
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:02,600
Just promise me
you'll be safe.

882
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:05,440
Okay.

883
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:08,720
Here.

884
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:33,880
Are these the only kinds
of movies you watch?

885
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:37,720
Why? You don't like it?

886
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:39,600
No, it's cool.

887
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:44,840
So, has Neil gotten
back to you yet?

888
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:50,600
Let me explain The
Universe of Neil McCormick.

889
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:53,560
He's like a planet,
Saturn say.

890
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:56,920
And we're all like little
moons orbiting around.

891
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,400
Now, do planets
write letters?

892
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,920
But I do know that he'll be
in Hutchinson for Christmas.

893
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:04,960
What?

894
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:06,720
His mom told me that she sent
him a ticket to fly home...

895
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:08,720
for Baby Jesus's Birthday.

896
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:10,680
So I'll introduce you then.

897
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:12,000
Brian?

898
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:15,320
Yeah?

899
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:18,560
Thought you two might
like a little study break.

900
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:19,840
Thanks, Mrs. Lackey.

901
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:21,320
Thanks, Mom.

902
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,320
It's 11:30.

903
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:29,240
If it's Avalyn...

904
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:31,480
tell her I'm not here.

905
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:35,160
Hello?

906
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:38,720
No, I'm sorry, Avalyn,
he's out with his friends.

907
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:39,760
No problem.

908
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:41,960
I thought you
kinda liked her.

909
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:44,560
I just...
I don't know.

910
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:48,760
I think I just need a little
space from her right now.

911
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:51,080
I always thought she
was a freak anyway.

912
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:53,160
So, I'm off to bed.

913
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:54,200
Good night, boys.

914
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:16,080
Hello.

915
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:22,840
I'm a...I'm Zeke.
From LA.

916
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:24,120
Neil.

917
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:29,280
Neil.

918
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:33,120
What are you doing
in New York City?

919
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:45,240
That's a..
that's a Vermeer.

920
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:50,560
Well, it's sort of a Vermeer.

921
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:40,000
You are exquisite.

922
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:48,760
I guess it's my turn, huh?

923
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:22,920
Hope these don't
frighten you too much.

924
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:30,000
They...have a habit of popping up
in the most inopportune places.

925
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:42,440
Oh, I know.
Don't be worried.

926
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:47,360
This is gonna be the safest
encounter you ever had.

927
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:58,200
If you could
just rub my back.

928
01:05:58,280 --> 01:06:02,200
Really, I need to be touched.

929
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:26,600
Yes, yes, yes,
yes, yes, yes.

930
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:28,760
Oh, make me happy.

931
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:31,680
Make me happy,
make me happy...

932
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:47,680
Yes, yes, yes,
yes, yes, yes.

933
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,640
Oh, make me happy.

934
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:27,920
You were 100
percent safe, right?

935
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,280
Yeah.

936
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:30,720
I told you I just jerked off.

937
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:32,800
He watched from
across the room.

938
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:36,080
For the first time in my
life I'm bothered by it.

939
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:44,040
Maybe you should try and find
some other safer way to make money.

940
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:46,840
You know,
like everyone else.

941
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:52,680
Yeah, maybe.

942
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:06,720
You're the only
one I've ever told.

943
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:10,320
I know.

944
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:14,080
I never told Eric,
or my Mom.

945
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:15,960
And I know some people
might think it's fucked up,

946
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:17,960
or terrible, or whatever?

947
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:24,120
But what happened that
summer...is a huge part of me.

948
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:28,120
No one ever made me feel
that way, before or since.

949
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:34,280
Like I was, I was special.

950
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:38,560
Neil...you were 8 years old.

951
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:41,320
Yeah, but he really loved me.

952
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:48,680
I mean, there were other
kids sometimes, but...

953
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:51,240
I was his prize.

954
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:58,120
I was his one true love.

955
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:17,920
Happy birthday.

956
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,400
You didn't have to
get me anything.

957
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:22,520
It's just a little
something I picked out.

958
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:29,760
Wow.

959
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:32,680
Cool.

960
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:34,600
I thought it'd go great
with your hair color.

961
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:36,560
It's so cool.

962
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:38,960
Thanks.

963
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:49,320
You alright?

964
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:52,880
I'm drunk.

965
01:09:55,880 --> 01:09:57,880
I've never been
drunk in my life!

966
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,160
I'm corrupting you.

967
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:01,200
At last!

968
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:08,200
Hey.
That's pretty good.

969
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:09,600
Yeah, sure.

970
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:11,680
No, really.

971
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:14,640
You have definite
artistic talent, my boy.

972
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:17,920
What?

973
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:21,640
That's an interesting touch.

974
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:26,600
So, what's the "deep meaning"
behind the baseball cleats?

975
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:31,080
I have no idea.

976
01:10:43,720 --> 01:10:44,400
Boo.

977
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:53,120
- How was work?
- Fuckin' boring.

978
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:56,960
- You need a hand?
- Sure.

979
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:04,760
So, I've got news for you.

980
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:07,160
Hey, me too.

981
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:09,120
Okay.
You first.

982
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:11,080
Look what my Mom
sent me today.

983
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:13,160
She wants me to come
home for Christmas.

984
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:17,480
Your mom is the coolest.

985
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:19,720
Like mine would
ever do that for me.

986
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:20,720
It's weird.

987
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:23,400
I hate Hutchinson
more than anything but...

988
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:25,720
But I'm kind of looking
forward to going back...

989
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:28,200
just for a short visit.

990
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:30,680
- Plus you get to see Eric.
- Yeah.

991
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:34,120
So what's your news?

992
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:38,680
I think I found you a job.

993
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:40,320
A what?

994
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:43,480
I was talking to this friend
at work, Rachel, about you.

995
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:46,960
It's only minimum wage at a
stupid sandwich place, but...

996
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:51,680
What?

997
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:53,120
You're not into it.
Whatever.

998
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:54,120
It's cool.

999
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:55,720
No, no, tell me
more about it.

1000
01:11:58,360 --> 01:11:59,120
Really?

1001
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:01,360
Yeah, really?
I want to hear more about it.

1002
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:03,080
- You do?
- Yeah.

1003
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:19,360
You sure you're
gonna be okay?

1004
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:22,080
I'm just glad my
Mom's working late.

1005
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:28,680
Thanks for everything.

1006
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:33,240
This has been...the
best birthday ever.

1007
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:36,600
You're welcome.

1008
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:43,240
Oh shit.

1009
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:46,000
- Who's that?
- It's my Dad.

1010
01:12:54,760 --> 01:12:56,280
Dad?

1011
01:12:56,400 --> 01:13:00,080
Son.
I caught you.

1012
01:13:00,160 --> 01:13:03,080
Your Mother said she didn't
know whether you'd be home or not.

1013
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:05,080
Happy Birthday.

1014
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:08,240
What are you doing here?

1015
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:11,040
I'm not allowed to wish my
only son a happy birthday?

1016
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:14,760
Dad, I haven't seen
you for what, 2 years?

1017
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:17,080
Well, maybe if you returned
my calls once in a while...

1018
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:20,400
Maybe I don't want to return
your phone calls, Dad.

1019
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:22,880
Maybe I just want you
to leave me alone.

1020
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,680
Brian, don't be like this.

1021
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:26,160
I drove all this way.

1022
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:27,680
I just wanted to see
how you're doing?

1023
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:29,520
Well, let me tell you
what I want to know.

1024
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:31,920
Something happened to
me when I was little.

1025
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,560
Do you know what
I'm talking about?

1026
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:36,040
What happened to me
that night I woke up...

1027
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:37,400
bleeding in the cellar?

1028
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:39,240
Where were you that night?

1029
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:42,640
God, I can tell you
don't even remember!

1030
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:43,800
You're drunk.

1031
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:45,560
Quit avoiding the subject!

1032
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:48,120
I was bleeding,
I kept passing out!

1033
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:51,240
I wet my fucking bed
and you never asked why!

1034
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:54,160
And what about that Halloween
when I blacked out again?

1035
01:13:54,280 --> 01:13:56,360
Something happened to
me both those nights!

1036
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:57,680
What do you know about it?

1037
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:58,760
Tell me!

1038
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:02,560
I'm sorry, Brian, I...

1039
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:05,680
I can't help you.

1040
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,680
Welcome to Subz.
May I help you?

1041
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:54,840
Brian?

1042
01:14:56,360 --> 01:14:57,320
Deborah!

1043
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:03,520
- Redecorating?
- Sort of, yeah.

1044
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:07,360
So how ya been, Bri?

1045
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:09,400
Good.
How's Berkeley?

1046
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:10,560
Hold on, you two.

1047
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:12,440
Why don't we continue this
conversation in the front room...

1048
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:14,800
over the peanut-butter peach pie
I baked for this occasion?

1049
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:17,960
Good to see you,
little brother.

1050
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:19,080
You too.

1051
01:15:45,560 --> 01:15:46,480
Need a lift?

1052
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:51,280
Sure.

1053
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:56,960
Where we going?

1054
01:15:57,080 --> 01:15:59,560
My place.
Don't worry, I'll pay.

1055
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:09,800
- It's Christmas Eve tomorrow.
- No more talking.

1056
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:33,520
- Where are we?
- Brighton Beach.

1057
01:16:58,240 --> 01:16:59,600
Bedroom's this way.

1058
01:17:16,840 --> 01:17:17,800
Do it.

1059
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:25,880
Again.

1060
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:39,080
Strip.

1061
01:17:55,560 --> 01:17:57,520
Open wide and suck it, slut.

1062
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:01,480
What are you
waiting for, slut?

1063
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:05,880
Suck it!

1064
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:10,320
You like that,
don't you, slut?

1065
01:18:10,440 --> 01:18:12,120
Take it deep.

1066
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:16,040
Moan for me.

1067
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:18,040
Wait, wait.

1068
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:24,720
Slut knows what's
coming next.

1069
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:26,760
I'm gonna give the slut just
what he's begging for...

1070
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:27,440
Wait, wait, wait.

1071
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:28,680
There's some
things I don't do.

1072
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:30,240
Wait.
I gotta take a piss.

1073
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:31,760
Hold on.
I'll be right back.

1074
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:56,480
You're getting fucked, slut,
whether you like it or not.

1075
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:01,520
Slut!

1076
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:08,920
Slut! Slut! Slut!
Slut! Slut! Slut!

1077
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:18,080
God, you love it!

1078
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:21,080
Take that cock all
the way up there.

1079
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:23,640
Take it, slut.

1080
01:19:23,720 --> 01:19:25,360
Yeah. Yeah!

1081
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:28,400
Are you ready?

1082
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:29,480
Here it comes.

1083
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:30,360
Are you ready?

1084
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:32,200
You ready? Ready?

1085
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:55,880
Mom.

1086
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:22,400
Today is the day.

1087
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:35,240
Brian!
Now where are you off to?

1088
01:22:35,320 --> 01:22:36,760
I'm going out with Eric.

1089
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:38,840
You don't want to stay and
talk with your sister a while?

1090
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:40,320
I'll be back soon.

1091
01:22:40,440 --> 01:22:41,720
Don't be late, young man.

1092
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:43,480
Christmas Eve dinner's at 6 sharp.

1093
01:22:43,560 --> 01:22:44,360
Okay.

1094
01:22:52,720 --> 01:22:53,680
Here we are.

1095
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:56,240
Do I look okay?

1096
01:22:56,320 --> 01:22:57,880
Okay's a relative term.

1097
01:22:59,080 --> 01:23:00,640
I'm kidding.
You look fine.

1098
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:02,120
Excited?

1099
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:03,880
Yes.

1100
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:05,440
And nervous.

1101
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:07,120
Don't worry.

1102
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:09,160
I'm sure you guys
will hit it off great.

1103
01:23:09,240 --> 01:23:10,440
I hope you're right.

1104
01:23:17,240 --> 01:23:18,120
Ellen?

1105
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:19,080
Ellen?

1106
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:23,520
Oh, hi, Eric.

1107
01:23:23,640 --> 01:23:25,160
Hey, Mrs. M.
Merry Christmas.

1108
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:27,280
You remember Brian.

1109
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:29,240
Of course I do.

1110
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:30,120
Hi, Brian.

1111
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:31,400
Merry Christmas.

1112
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:33,000
So where's the
Man of the Hour?

1113
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:34,680
I was going to call you.

1114
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:36,960
Why?
What happened?

1115
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:39,720
There's been an accident.

1116
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:45,200
Neil, he got mugged on
the way to the airport.

1117
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:47,200
Is he okay?

1118
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:51,040
He's going to be fine.
He's asleep in his room.

1119
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:55,480
Well, maybe we should
come back tomorrow.

1120
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:57,040
Maybe.

1121
01:23:57,080 --> 01:23:59,080
Or you stay if you'd like,
have some cookies...

1122
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:00,680
and we'll see if he's...

1123
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:05,560
Honey, you're up.

1124
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:09,360
The fuck you staring at, Preston?

1125
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:14,320
Brian says that you both were
in Little League together.

1126
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:15,880
Mm-hmm.

1127
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:20,080
So how long has it been since
you two last saw each other?

1128
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:23,600
10 years.

1129
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:26,800
5 months and...7 days.

1130
01:24:28,160 --> 01:24:30,520
Well, you must have a lot
of catching up to do.

1131
01:24:33,560 --> 01:24:36,240
Turn right off Main
by the fairgrounds.

1132
01:24:36,360 --> 01:24:37,960
So what the fuck happened?

1133
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:39,880
It's a long story.
I'll tell you later.

1134
01:24:39,960 --> 01:24:41,360
Just drive for now.

1135
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:44,240
It's nice to see New York hasn't
hardened you one bit, McCormick.

1136
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:51,840
So you're the legendary Brian.

1137
01:24:54,120 --> 01:24:55,840
We have a lot in
common, don't we?

1138
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:58,160
I think so.

1139
01:25:08,720 --> 01:25:10,080
Make a left at the
next stop sign.

1140
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:15,240
Is this starting
to look familiar?

1141
01:25:21,480 --> 01:25:22,560
Pick us up in a half hour.

1142
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:25,760
Okay.

1143
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:39,880
You ready?

1144
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:54,000
Blue.

1145
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:07,480
No one's home.
Let's go around back.

1146
01:26:12,280 --> 01:26:13,560
We have to get in.

1147
01:26:16,280 --> 01:26:17,400
I know a way, here.

1148
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:25,840
Voila.

1149
01:26:25,960 --> 01:26:29,120
You were the best player
on the team, weren't you?

1150
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:30,800
That's what he
always told me.

1151
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:43,480
Help.

1152
01:26:55,240 --> 01:26:57,480
This was his bedroom.

1153
01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:00,960
At least the ceiling's
still the same.

1154
01:27:01,080 --> 01:27:04,880
I used to get lost for hours
staring at all the patterns.

1155
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:08,040
Whirls, speckly,
sparkly things.

1156
01:27:10,680 --> 01:27:11,720
Come on.

1157
01:27:22,680 --> 01:27:24,760
Oh, man.
What's up with these people?

1158
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:26,960
He used to keep
these things stocked.

1159
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:41,440
This is it, right?

1160
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:55,600
So, why now?
Why did you search me out?

1161
01:27:58,760 --> 01:28:00,960
I'm tired of it.

1162
01:28:01,080 --> 01:28:03,360
I want to dream about
something else for a change.

1163
01:28:19,480 --> 01:28:21,080
"Away in a Manger."

1164
01:28:22,360 --> 01:28:26,200
It took till I actually laid
eyes on you today to remember you.

1165
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:31,040
When Eric wrote me about you,
I could only get the vaguest,

1166
01:28:31,120 --> 01:28:32,800
hazy picture in my head.

1167
01:28:32,920 --> 01:28:34,560
Like a staticky TV.

1168
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:36,560
Same here.

1169
01:28:38,240 --> 01:28:42,440
But seeing you here
in this room...

1170
01:28:42,520 --> 01:28:45,160
I feel like he's
watching us right now.

1171
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:51,440
I have no idea what
happened to him.

1172
01:28:51,560 --> 01:28:54,160
After that summer,
he just disappeared.

1173
01:28:54,240 --> 01:28:56,680
I don't even know if
he's alive or what.

1174
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:59,960
Maybe it's his ghost
that's watching us.

1175
01:29:00,040 --> 01:29:01,960
Tell me everything you can.

1176
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:10,480
Well, I was his favorite.

1177
01:29:12,640 --> 01:29:14,360
Out of everyone,
he picked me.

1178
01:29:16,680 --> 01:29:18,720
I know that sounds
kind of weird, but,

1179
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:20,360
when it first
started happening...

1180
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:24,760
I felt honored.

1181
01:29:24,840 --> 01:29:26,160
Go on.

1182
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:32,520
I don't know, this is
where the big TV was,

1183
01:29:32,640 --> 01:29:34,840
all the cool video games.

1184
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:36,680
That's the kitchen.

1185
01:29:36,760 --> 01:29:39,840
The first time,
it happened there.

1186
01:29:44,360 --> 01:29:48,160
It lasted that whole summer.
Just me and him.

1187
01:29:49,480 --> 01:29:52,080
I saw him one other time.

1188
01:29:52,120 --> 01:29:55,640
On Halloween, a
couple years later.

1189
01:29:55,760 --> 01:29:57,960
I was lost.

1190
01:29:58,080 --> 01:30:00,000
He said my name.

1191
01:30:00,760 --> 01:30:01,840
Brian?

1192
01:30:03,160 --> 01:30:04,280
Brian?

1193
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:10,480
I thought that was you.

1194
01:30:13,200 --> 01:30:15,600
The game had just started.

1195
01:30:15,720 --> 01:30:18,560
I was sitting on
the bench as always.

1196
01:30:18,640 --> 01:30:20,760
It started to rain...

1197
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:24,120
Sprinkles at first,
then a downpour.

1198
01:30:26,280 --> 01:30:27,560
The ump called the game.

1199
01:30:29,120 --> 01:30:30,840
And no one came
to pick you up.

1200
01:30:30,920 --> 01:30:35,320
My Mom was working
and my Dad, who knows?

1201
01:30:35,440 --> 01:30:38,080
Everyone else drove
off with their parents.

1202
01:30:38,160 --> 01:30:40,600
I was left there all alone.

1203
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:43,920
Then you were in the dugout
with me and you said...

1204
01:30:44,040 --> 01:30:45,800
We'll take you home.

1205
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:52,720
And we got in Coach's
station wagon, remember?

1206
01:30:58,040 --> 01:30:59,120
He brought us here.

1207
01:31:02,280 --> 01:31:03,120
It's all right, Brian.

1208
01:31:03,200 --> 01:31:04,680
We're just going to have
a little bit of fun.

1209
01:31:09,080 --> 01:31:12,280
And he didn't want you in the
bedroom because that was just for us.

1210
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:16,640
So it all happened
here, in this room.

1211
01:31:16,760 --> 01:31:19,120
Keep going.

1212
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:21,600
Don't stop until you've
told me everything.

1213
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:26,160
Anytime there was
another boy involved,

1214
01:31:26,280 --> 01:31:27,840
it was always the same.

1215
01:31:27,880 --> 01:31:30,760
Coach used me as a
prop to pull you in.

1216
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:34,040
He'd take off my clothes
and it was up to me...

1217
01:31:34,160 --> 01:31:38,200
to make it seem like fun, like this
is a really cool game we were playing.

1218
01:31:38,280 --> 01:31:39,720
Go ahead, show him, Neil.

1219
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:41,240
All right, here
are the rules.

1220
01:31:41,360 --> 01:31:43,880
First I kiss you,
then you kiss me back,

1221
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:45,320
then it's his turn.

1222
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:49,280
Are you ready?

1223
01:31:51,880 --> 01:31:53,160
Here we go.

1224
01:31:56,040 --> 01:31:58,160
My God!

1225
01:31:58,280 --> 01:32:00,320
You want me to stop?

1226
01:32:07,960 --> 01:32:11,040
So I put my tongue
in your mouth,

1227
01:32:11,080 --> 01:32:14,080
getting it all wet and shiny.

1228
01:32:14,160 --> 01:32:15,680
Then it was his turn.

1229
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:19,480
Watching his big lips
sucking your face,

1230
01:32:19,560 --> 01:32:22,640
I remember thinking, "oh, he's
going to swallow his head whole".

1231
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:31,880
So we took off your clothes
and you made this...

1232
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:36,120
whimpering puppy sound
that Coach always loved.

1233
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:41,360
Coach and me had this thing
where he would open up his mouth,

1234
01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:45,840
and wrap it around my dick and balls
and everything all at once.

1235
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:48,120
He did that to me.

1236
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:50,760
Then I tried to do it to you
but couldn't because...

1237
01:32:50,840 --> 01:32:52,560
my mouth was too small.

1238
01:32:56,880 --> 01:32:58,680
Then...

1239
01:32:58,760 --> 01:33:00,560
he went down on you.

1240
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:05,480
For what seemed like
a really long time.

1241
01:33:06,360 --> 01:33:08,880
Your eyes were closed mostly,
but every now and then...

1242
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:15,120
they would flutter open, and just
had this glassy, faraway look.

1243
01:33:15,200 --> 01:33:20,040
And then I leaned
in and whispered.

1244
01:33:20,160 --> 01:33:23,600
It's fun, right?
Tell him you think it's fun.

1245
01:33:35,680 --> 01:33:36,960
We're almost finished.

1246
01:33:38,480 --> 01:33:39,840
You're gonna be able?

1247
01:33:39,960 --> 01:33:41,440
Yeah.

1248
01:33:44,600 --> 01:33:47,320
Then we played
the 5 dollar game.

1249
01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:52,440
When Coach would ask me to
do things, crazy sex things.

1250
01:33:52,520 --> 01:33:54,640
And if I could do them,
he'd give me a 5 dollar bill.

1251
01:33:54,720 --> 01:33:57,560
It's okay.
Go ahead, Neil.

1252
01:34:07,720 --> 01:34:11,200
He made us fist him.
Do you know what that is?

1253
01:34:17,480 --> 01:34:20,080
I went first, of course.

1254
01:34:20,200 --> 01:34:24,840
And on that night, the 5 dollars
was mine if I could ram...

1255
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:30,960
my little fist up his ass and
wring it all the way to the elbow.

1256
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,680
And goddamn it, I did it.

1257
01:34:33,800 --> 01:34:35,680
I'll never forget
how it felt.

1258
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:39,320
It felt like his whole body
was trying to suck me into it.

1259
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:40,480
Devour me.

1260
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:45,000
And then I did it too.

1261
01:34:52,720 --> 01:34:57,480
And then we drove you back to
Little River and left you in your driveway.

1262
01:34:57,600 --> 01:34:58,720
The End.

1263
01:35:03,040 --> 01:35:04,720
And my nose was bleeding.

1264
01:35:07,480 --> 01:35:08,600
How did that happen?

1265
01:35:20,080 --> 01:35:24,040
When it was over and we
were getting you dressed,

1266
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:29,280
your face looked like
you'd been erased.

1267
01:35:29,400 --> 01:35:32,000
Like you were
just empty inside.

1268
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:33,800
And you just fell.

1269
01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:35,360
Face first on the floor.
Bam.

1270
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:39,680
And when we pulled you up,
your nose was bleeding.

1271
01:35:39,800 --> 01:35:40,840
Like this?

1272
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:45,440
Like this?!

1273
01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:47,920
Shh. Stop. Stop. Stop.

1274
01:35:59,120 --> 01:36:00,240
What are you doing?

1275
01:36:00,360 --> 01:36:01,800
No one's even home.

1276
01:36:01,920 --> 01:36:03,400
No, someone's there.

1277
01:36:03,480 --> 01:36:04,800
I can see them.

1278
01:36:06,600 --> 01:36:08,000
Look, I see them, too.

1279
01:36:08,120 --> 01:36:09,920
What's going on?

1280
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,240
I think that
someone's in there.

1281
01:36:43,040 --> 01:36:45,560
And as we sat there
listening to the carolers,

1282
01:36:45,680 --> 01:36:49,680
I wanted to tell Brian it was over
now and everything would be okay.

1283
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:53,000
But that was a lie, plus,
I couldn't speak anyway.

1284
01:36:55,160 --> 01:36:58,000
I wish there was some way for
us to go back and undo the past.

1285
01:37:00,280 --> 01:37:01,480
But there wasn't.

1286
01:37:02,880 --> 01:37:05,720
There was nothing
we could do.

1287
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:10,440
So I just stayed silent and trying
to telepathically communicate...

1288
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:12,840
how sorry I was
about what had happened.

1289
01:37:15,480 --> 01:37:17,160
And I thought of all
the grief and sadness...

1290
01:37:17,240 --> 01:37:18,840
and fucked up suffering in the
world...

1291
01:37:18,920 --> 01:37:22,600
and it made me
want to escape.

1292
01:37:22,720 --> 01:37:23,960
I wished with all my heart
that we could just...

1293
01:37:24,080 --> 01:37:27,120
leave this world behind.

1294
01:37:27,200 --> 01:37:31,680
Rise like two angels in
the night and magically...

1295
01:37:31,800 --> 01:37:33,160
disappear.

1296
01:37:34,160 --> 01:37:44,160
