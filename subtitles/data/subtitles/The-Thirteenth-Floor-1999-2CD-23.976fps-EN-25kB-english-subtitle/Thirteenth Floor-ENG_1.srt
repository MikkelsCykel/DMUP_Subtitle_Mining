1
00:00:43,662 --> 00:00:45,747
They say ignorance is bliss.

2
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:49,918
For the first time
in my life, I agree.

3
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,968
I wish...

4
00:00:52,003 --> 00:00:56,174
...I had never uncovered
the awful truth.

5
00:00:56,209 --> 00:00:58,224
I know now...

6
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:02,430
...once they find out,
they will try to silence me.

7
00:01:03,473 --> 00:01:07,644
That is why I've written this
all down for you in this letter.

8
00:01:07,679 --> 00:01:11,311
You are the only one
whom I can tell this to.

9
00:01:11,346 --> 00:01:14,943
The only one who could
possibly understand.

10
00:01:15,986 --> 00:01:19,114
Good luck, my friend.

11
00:01:59,779 --> 00:02:01,865
I hope you enjoyed your stay.

12
00:02:09,164 --> 00:02:10,206
Mr. Fuller,
nice having you here.

13
00:02:11,249 --> 00:02:12,292
Your usual table?

14
00:02:13,335 --> 00:02:15,420
No, thanks, Gene.

15
00:02:44,616 --> 00:02:45,659
Her name is Erika.

16
00:02:49,829 --> 00:02:50,872
She's from Toledo.

17
00:02:51,915 --> 00:02:55,043
Ashton, would you do me a favour?

18
00:02:56,086 --> 00:02:57,128
You'd like to meet her?

19
00:02:57,163 --> 00:02:59,214
I want you...

20
00:03:00,256 --> 00:03:02,307
...to keep this letter.

21
00:03:02,342 --> 00:03:05,470
Somebody will ask for it.
A man named Douglas Hall.

22
00:03:07,555 --> 00:03:10,684
Remember, it's crucial
that he receives it.

23
00:03:12,769 --> 00:03:13,812
It's a walk in the park.

24
00:03:26,324 --> 00:03:27,367
Going home, Mr. Fuller?

25
00:03:27,402 --> 00:03:29,452
Yes, Charlie.

26
00:05:18,937 --> 00:05:20,987
We're out of cat food, honey.

27
00:05:21,022 --> 00:05:23,108
Yes, I'll buy some in the morning.

28
00:05:27,278 --> 00:05:29,364
You've been smoking again.

29
00:05:52,304 --> 00:05:53,311
Download complete.

30
00:05:53,346 --> 00:05:56,474
Link to simulation terminated.

31
00:06:31,926 --> 00:06:32,969
Martini, please.

32
00:06:43,396 --> 00:06:44,404
One martini.

33
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:46,524
You forgot the olive.

34
00:06:47,567 --> 00:06:48,610
We're out of olives.

35
00:06:49,653 --> 00:06:50,695
How about pretzels?

36
00:06:51,738 --> 00:06:52,781
No, thank you.

37
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:07,379
Please leave a message at the tone.

38
00:07:07,414 --> 00:07:09,464
Douglas, it's me.

39
00:07:10,507 --> 00:07:13,635
Listen, I've stumbled
onto something incredible.

40
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:15,720
This changes everything.

41
00:07:32,404 --> 00:07:33,446
I don't know...

42
00:07:35,532 --> 00:07:37,617
I don't even know how to begin.

43
00:07:40,745 --> 00:07:41,788
What are you doing?

44
00:07:56,386 --> 00:07:58,471
You have new messages.

45
00:08:14,112 --> 00:08:16,197
You have new messages.

46
00:08:23,496 --> 00:08:26,103
You have three new messages.

47
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:28,710
First new message.: 5.:25 a. m.

48
00:08:29,753 --> 00:08:32,881
Douglas, it's Hilary.
Don't forget to call Marshall.

49
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:34,966
Legal is screaming
for the contract.

50
00:08:36,009 --> 00:08:39,137
I'll have a notary come
to the office at lunch.

51
00:08:39,172 --> 00:08:41,222
Next new message.: 5.:48 a. m.

52
00:08:43,308 --> 00:08:47,479
It's me again.
Please call me as soon as you get up.

53
00:08:47,514 --> 00:08:50,607
Next new message.: 6.:13 a. m.

54
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:54,778
Mr. Douglas Hall,
this is Detective McBain, LAPD.

55
00:08:54,813 --> 00:08:56,863
I'd appreciate a callback, please.

56
00:08:56,898 --> 00:09:01,034
My phone number is 555-7876.

57
00:09:15,632 --> 00:09:18,725
I'm Detective Zev Bernstein.

58
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,845
Sorry to drag you
out of bed so early.

59
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,974
This is Detective McBain.

60
00:09:27,102 --> 00:09:29,152
Mr. Hall?

61
00:09:29,187 --> 00:09:30,230
Thanks for coming down.

62
00:09:31,272 --> 00:09:32,280
Where is he?

63
00:09:32,315 --> 00:09:35,443
- Can I get you some coffee?
- No, thank you.

64
00:09:37,529 --> 00:09:38,571
That him?

65
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:55,255
We found him in an alley
at Spring and Grand.

66
00:09:56,297 --> 00:09:59,426
Looks like he ran into some guy
who wasn't just asking for a quarter.

67
00:09:59,461 --> 00:10:01,476
Carved him up like a ham.

68
00:10:01,511 --> 00:10:04,639
Took everything:
wallet, credit cards.

69
00:10:04,674 --> 00:10:06,725
Got a kick out of it.

70
00:10:07,767 --> 00:10:09,853
What's your connection
to the old man?

71
00:10:09,888 --> 00:10:11,938
I worked with him for six years.

72
00:10:12,981 --> 00:10:14,024
He was my boss.

73
00:10:16,109 --> 00:10:18,194
My friend.

74
00:10:21,323 --> 00:10:23,408
Hey, cigarette?

75
00:10:26,536 --> 00:10:27,579
I don't smoke.

76
00:10:29,664 --> 00:10:30,707
We found these on him.

77
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,843
Traced the prescription.
According to his doctor...

78
00:10:34,878 --> 00:10:38,006
...Fuller listed you to call
in case of medical emergencies.

79
00:10:39,049 --> 00:10:40,091
He had no next of kin?

80
00:10:41,134 --> 00:10:43,219
No, he didn't.

81
00:10:43,254 --> 00:10:44,227
You sure?

82
00:10:44,262 --> 00:10:46,348
I think he would've told me.

83
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:49,476
Have any idea who killed him?

84
00:10:50,518 --> 00:10:52,604
Everybody liked him.

85
00:10:57,817 --> 00:10:58,860
Mind if I tag along?

86
00:11:00,945 --> 00:11:05,116
Or we can continue in my office,
if that's more convenient.

87
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:07,202
That's fine.

88
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:15,543
What do you do
for a paycheck, anyway?

89
00:11:16,586 --> 00:11:17,594
Computer software.

90
00:11:17,629 --> 00:11:21,278
Would you mind taking care
of the car this morning?

91
00:11:21,313 --> 00:11:24,928
- Must make some decent bucks, huh?
- I make a living.

92
00:11:25,971 --> 00:11:29,099
- This was his apartment.
- You could be home already.

93
00:11:31,184 --> 00:11:34,277
I see these signs
every time I leave work:

94
00:11:34,312 --> 00:11:37,440
"You could be home already.
Apartment living in downtown. "

95
00:11:40,568 --> 00:11:42,619
Never expected it could look
anything like this.

96
00:11:42,654 --> 00:11:46,825
This company was Fuller's life.
He worked and lived here.

97
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:49,953
So what exactly
do you people do here?

98
00:11:52,038 --> 00:11:54,123
You wouldn't be interested.

99
00:11:54,158 --> 00:11:56,209
I'm paid to be interested.

100
00:11:56,244 --> 00:11:58,294
Computer research.

101
00:11:59,337 --> 00:12:01,423
Fuller was onto...

102
00:12:02,465 --> 00:12:04,551
...a whole new frontier.

103
00:12:05,593 --> 00:12:07,644
Very sensitive material.

104
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:08,722
Not at liberty to discuss it.

105
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:12,892
A lot of money involved.

106
00:12:13,935 --> 00:12:17,063
This apartment must be worth
a few million dollars.

107
00:12:18,106 --> 00:12:20,191
One of the perks of the job.

108
00:12:24,362 --> 00:12:27,490
This job has a whole lot of perks.

109
00:12:35,832 --> 00:12:37,917
Can I help you?

110
00:12:51,473 --> 00:12:53,558
I just talked to him two days ago.

111
00:12:55,644 --> 00:12:57,729
I can't believe he's gone.

112
00:13:00,857 --> 00:13:02,942
My name is Jane Fuller.

113
00:13:02,977 --> 00:13:05,028
Hannon was my father.

114
00:13:09,199 --> 00:13:11,284
I'm sorry.
I'm Douglas Hall.

115
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:16,498
You're the one
he always wanted me to meet.

116
00:13:16,533 --> 00:13:19,626
He never mentioned
that he had a daughter.

117
00:13:20,669 --> 00:13:21,711
He didn't?

118
00:13:23,797 --> 00:13:27,968
I arrived from Paris this morning.
I was supposed to meet him.

119
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:30,053
But then I heard.

120
00:13:31,096 --> 00:13:33,181
My condolences, Miss Fuller.

121
00:13:33,216 --> 00:13:35,231
I'm Detective McBain, LAPD.

122
00:13:35,266 --> 00:13:37,352
I have to ask you some questions.

123
00:13:38,395 --> 00:13:41,523
- Of course.
- Would you excuse us, Mr. Hall?

124
00:13:43,608 --> 00:13:44,651
Sure.

125
00:13:50,907 --> 00:13:52,993
Have we ever met before?

126
00:13:56,121 --> 00:13:57,163
No, that's not possible.

127
00:13:59,249 --> 00:14:01,334
You look very familiar.

128
00:14:02,377 --> 00:14:04,462
Nice to meet you, Miss Fuller.

129
00:14:44,085 --> 00:14:46,171
Hey, Whitney.
How you doing?

130
00:14:47,213 --> 00:14:49,299
Sliced him up like an animal.

131
00:14:51,384 --> 00:14:52,427
And for what?

132
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:57,641
He was the Einstein of our generation.
It's a waste.

133
00:15:01,811 --> 00:15:03,897
What the hell happened
while I was away?

134
00:15:05,982 --> 00:15:09,110
He was jacking
into the system a lot.

135
00:15:11,196 --> 00:15:13,246
I thought you knew.
You didn't know?

136
00:15:13,281 --> 00:15:15,888
We're months away
from the first trial run.

137
00:15:15,923 --> 00:15:18,495
We are. You know, he was
taking a big chance.

138
00:15:19,537 --> 00:15:22,666
What was I supposed to do?
You know how he is.

139
00:15:25,794 --> 00:15:26,836
Were there complications?

140
00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:28,922
None that I know of yet.

141
00:15:33,093 --> 00:15:35,178
Did he ever tell you
he had a daughter?

142
00:15:37,263 --> 00:15:39,349
- Why?
- Because I just met her.

143
00:15:39,384 --> 00:15:41,434
You're kidding me.

144
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:58,118
John, I need the number
of that cab company.

145
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,168
No need, sir.

146
00:16:00,203 --> 00:16:02,288
She went to the Omni Hotel.

147
00:16:16,886 --> 00:16:17,894
Detective McBain.

148
00:16:17,929 --> 00:16:20,015
Sorry to disappoint you.

149
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:22,065
I'll find Doug.

150
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,185
It's you I wanted to talk with.

151
00:16:26,271 --> 00:16:27,279
What for?

152
00:16:27,314 --> 00:16:29,399
Want me to catch your boss's killer?

153
00:16:30,442 --> 00:16:31,484
Of course.

154
00:16:32,527 --> 00:16:35,620
The whole thing's
a giant computer game?

155
00:16:35,655 --> 00:16:39,304
No, it doesn't need a user
to interact with it to function.

156
00:16:39,339 --> 00:16:42,954
Its units are fully formed,
self-learning cyber beings.

157
00:16:43,997 --> 00:16:46,082
- Units?
- Electronic, simulated characters.

158
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:49,210
They populate the system.

159
00:16:49,245 --> 00:16:50,270
They think...

160
00:16:50,305 --> 00:16:51,296
...they work...

161
00:16:52,339 --> 00:16:53,381
...they eat.

162
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:54,424
They fuck?

163
00:16:56,509 --> 00:16:59,603
Let's just say that
they're modeled after us.

164
00:16:59,638 --> 00:17:03,808
Right now, we have a working prototype:
Los Angeles, circa 1937.

165
00:17:04,851 --> 00:17:05,859
Why '37?

166
00:17:05,894 --> 00:17:10,065
Fuller wanted to start by re-creating
the era of his youth.

167
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,107
You see...

168
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:15,278
...while my mind is jacked in...

169
00:17:17,364 --> 00:17:20,492
...I'm walking around
experiencing 1937.

170
00:17:20,527 --> 00:17:22,577
My body stays here...

171
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:26,748
...and holds the consciousness
of the program link unit.

172
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:29,876
You think one of them units
crawled up an extension cord...

173
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:31,961
...and killed its maker?

174
00:17:37,175 --> 00:17:39,260
Miss Fuller checked in yet?

175
00:17:43,431 --> 00:17:45,517
Miss Fuller.

176
00:17:47,602 --> 00:17:48,645
Glad I caught you.

177
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,730
Mr. Hall.

178
00:17:51,773 --> 00:17:53,823
What are you doing here?

179
00:17:53,858 --> 00:17:55,944
It's about your father, actually.

180
00:17:56,987 --> 00:17:59,072
You said you spoke with him
a few days ago.

181
00:18:00,115 --> 00:18:03,243
Can you tell me anything
about that conversation?

182
00:18:03,278 --> 00:18:07,414
Did he seem strange to you at all?

183
00:18:10,542 --> 00:18:12,592
He'd been under
a lot of stress lately.

184
00:18:12,627 --> 00:18:16,798
He asked me to fly to the States,
so I could help with the company.

185
00:18:17,841 --> 00:18:18,883
Help him run it?

186
00:18:20,969 --> 00:18:22,012
Shut it down.

187
00:18:24,097 --> 00:18:28,268
I worked with him for six years.
If he wanted to shut it down...

188
00:18:29,311 --> 00:18:31,396
...he would've told me about it.

189
00:18:32,439 --> 00:18:34,524
He didn't tell you about me.

190
00:18:42,866 --> 00:18:43,908
But I wish he had.

191
00:19:00,592 --> 00:19:02,642
It's nice to see you again.

192
00:19:02,677 --> 00:19:06,326
Sorry I'm late.
Have you looked through the paperwork?

193
00:19:06,361 --> 00:19:09,976
Yes, I have. And I think
we have a very strong case.

194
00:19:10,011 --> 00:19:13,069
The company should be
yours in no time.

195
00:19:13,104 --> 00:19:15,190
- Strong case?
- What I'm saying is, your father...

196
00:19:16,232 --> 00:19:18,318
...changed his will
in favour of the employees.

197
00:19:19,361 --> 00:19:22,489
In fact, you aren't mentioned
in the original will either.

198
00:19:22,524 --> 00:19:25,617
But as I said, I think
we have a very strong case.

199
00:19:27,702 --> 00:19:29,788
Who will head the board now?

200
00:19:29,823 --> 00:19:30,830
Douglas Hall.

201
00:19:39,172 --> 00:19:40,180
Not bad.

202
00:19:40,215 --> 00:19:43,308
Owner of a $2 billion enterprise.

203
00:19:43,343 --> 00:19:47,514
Strange, Fuller would amend
his will just before he died.

204
00:19:47,549 --> 00:19:49,599
I was on an airplane
when it happened.

205
00:19:50,642 --> 00:19:54,813
According to the security guard,
Fuller left the office at 10:30 p. m.

206
00:19:55,855 --> 00:19:56,898
30 minutes after your plane arrived.

207
00:20:01,069 --> 00:20:03,154
Autopsy shows that
he died around midnight.

208
00:20:04,197 --> 00:20:07,325
- You had time to catch up with him.
- But I didn't.

209
00:20:10,453 --> 00:20:12,539
- I went straight home.
- Didn't talk to him?

210
00:20:13,581 --> 00:20:16,710
No e-mails, no faxes,
not even a message?

211
00:20:16,745 --> 00:20:17,752
None of the above.

212
00:20:18,795 --> 00:20:20,880
You know, that's funny.

213
00:20:21,923 --> 00:20:23,974
We checked Fuller's phone records.

214
00:20:24,009 --> 00:20:27,137
He made a call with
his calling card at 11:02 p. m.

215
00:20:30,265 --> 00:20:31,308
Shit!

216
00:20:33,393 --> 00:20:34,436
Your home number.

217
00:20:38,606 --> 00:20:41,735
I'd appreciate it if you didn't
leave town for a couple of days.

218
00:20:42,777 --> 00:20:44,862
And get that game fixed.

219
00:20:44,897 --> 00:20:46,948
It's missing a spring.

220
00:20:59,461 --> 00:21:01,025
You have no new...

221
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,589
Restore. Restore.

222
00:21:03,631 --> 00:21:07,802
To restore messages,
press "rewind" now.

223
00:21:08,845 --> 00:21:11,973
- Yesterday at 2.:45 p. m.
- I managed to reschedule...

224
00:21:13,016 --> 00:21:16,665
- Yesterday at 5.:14 p. m.
- Hello, Mr. Hall...

225
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:20,071
- Yesterday at 11.:02 p. m.
- Douglas, it's me.

226
00:21:20,106 --> 00:21:23,443
Listen, I've stumbled
onto something incredible.

227
00:21:23,478 --> 00:21:25,493
This changes everything.

228
00:21:25,528 --> 00:21:29,664
I'm here in some bar on Main and 7th.

229
00:21:29,699 --> 00:21:33,870
In case something happens to me,
I left you a message in the system.

230
00:21:33,905 --> 00:21:35,920
I gave it to...

231
00:21:35,955 --> 00:21:38,041
How did you find me?

232
00:22:00,981 --> 00:22:02,023
What's going on?

233
00:22:03,066 --> 00:22:06,194
I'm trying to get
into Fuller's files.

234
00:22:06,229 --> 00:22:08,279
For what?

235
00:22:09,322 --> 00:22:11,408
He left a message for me
the night he died.

236
00:22:14,536 --> 00:22:17,664
- He knew someone wanted to kill him.
- Did you tell the police?

237
00:22:17,699 --> 00:22:18,707
Why not?

238
00:22:19,749 --> 00:22:22,877
He also said he left a message
for me in the system.

239
00:22:22,912 --> 00:22:26,006
Douglas, please.
This is my stuff, okay?

240
00:22:33,305 --> 00:22:37,475
These are the units that Fuller
interacted with when he was there.

241
00:22:39,561 --> 00:22:40,603
Maybe he wanted me to go in.

242
00:22:43,732 --> 00:22:46,860
If you're thinking what
I think you're thinking...

243
00:22:46,895 --> 00:22:48,945
...don't even think about it.

244
00:22:49,988 --> 00:22:50,996
I need your help.

245
00:22:51,031 --> 00:22:53,081
No, no, no. I won't help you.

246
00:22:53,116 --> 00:22:56,244
- It's a serious risk.
- I have to get in.

247
00:22:57,287 --> 00:22:59,337
You could die.

248
00:22:59,372 --> 00:23:01,458
The cops think I killed him.

249
00:23:04,586 --> 00:23:05,593
They may be right.

250
00:23:05,628 --> 00:23:08,757
- What do you mean?
- Everything points to me.

251
00:23:11,885 --> 00:23:16,021
To be perfectly honest,
I don't know what the truth is anymore.

252
00:23:16,056 --> 00:23:21,269
Either I did murder Fuller and
I can't remember, or I'm being framed.

253
00:23:21,304 --> 00:23:24,414
The one clue I have is in that machine.

254
00:23:24,449 --> 00:23:27,525
I need your help
if I'm going to find it.

255
00:23:32,739 --> 00:23:35,867
I'll set it for an hour.

256
00:23:40,038 --> 00:23:41,081
Set it for 120 minutes.

257
00:23:42,123 --> 00:23:43,166
Sixty is better.

258
00:23:43,201 --> 00:23:44,209
120 minutes, Whit.

259
00:23:45,251 --> 00:23:47,337
60 is safer.
I'm setting it at 60.

260
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:49,422
1-2-0.

261
00:23:58,807 --> 00:24:02,978
120 minutes. Engage timer.

262
00:24:14,447 --> 00:24:18,618
Preparing user for download.

263
00:24:24,874 --> 00:24:26,925
Ready for download.

264
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,088
Mr. Grierson,
117 West Winston, Pasadena...

265
00:24:43,643 --> 00:24:45,729
Transference beginning.

266

267
00:24:59,284 --> 00:25:00,327
...five cents!

268
00:25:13,882 --> 00:25:17,010
You owe me 12 dollars
and five cents.

269
00:25:19,095 --> 00:25:20,659
Listen, young man!

270
00:25:20,694 --> 00:25:22,223
I do not have all day!

271
00:25:26,394 --> 00:25:28,480
Ferguson, anything wrong?

272
00:25:30,565 --> 00:25:31,608
John, are you okay?

273
00:25:50,377 --> 00:25:53,505
I'm terribly sorry, ma'am.
Someone will be right with you.

274
00:26:23,743 --> 00:26:25,829
Oh, my God.

275
00:26:39,384 --> 00:26:41,469
- Cigarette?
- No, thanks. Don't smoke.

276
00:26:43,555 --> 00:26:44,597
Since when?

277
00:26:46,683 --> 00:26:47,726
Listen, John...

278
00:26:48,768 --> 00:26:50,854
...why don't you...

279
00:26:51,896 --> 00:26:53,982
Why don't you break for lunch?

280
00:26:54,017 --> 00:26:56,067
Get some fresh air.

281
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:59,195
You look terrible.

282
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:09,622
I think I look pretty good.

283
00:27:25,263 --> 00:27:28,391
Extra! Extra!
Zeppelin blast kills 35!

284
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:34,648
You want one, mister?
It's five cents.

285
00:27:41,946 --> 00:27:44,032
Hey, watch out, buddy!

286
00:27:53,416 --> 00:27:55,467
- How much to Pasadena?
-90 cents.

287
00:27:55,502 --> 00:27:58,630
- If I forget to turn the metre on.
- I understand.

288
00:28:16,356 --> 00:28:18,441
This is it, 117 Winston.

289
00:28:19,484 --> 00:28:22,612
- Do you mind waiting?
- It'll be a pleasure, sir.

290
00:28:44,509 --> 00:28:47,637
- Tell me if you need any help.
- Thank you.

291
00:29:01,192 --> 00:29:02,235
You own this place?

292
00:29:04,321 --> 00:29:06,406
I mean, it's not much...

293
00:29:07,449 --> 00:29:08,491
...but it's mine.

294
00:29:16,833 --> 00:29:19,961
You looking for anything
in particular?

295
00:29:21,004 --> 00:29:23,089
Interested in a scientist.

296
00:29:24,132 --> 00:29:26,217
Wrote a couple of books...

297
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:30,353
...about semiconductors...

298
00:29:30,388 --> 00:29:33,516
...and the limitations
of the 64-bit microchip.

299
00:29:33,551 --> 00:29:34,559
Microchip.

300
00:29:35,602 --> 00:29:37,687
Semiconductors.

301
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:39,773
What year?

302
00:29:40,815 --> 00:29:42,901
Early '70s?

303
00:29:43,943 --> 00:29:44,986
His name was Hannon Fuller.

304
00:29:46,029 --> 00:29:47,072
Hannon Fuller.

305
00:29:48,114 --> 00:29:49,157
1870.

306
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:54,370
No, I can't say I've ever heard of...

307
00:29:54,405 --> 00:29:58,506
...Hannon Fuller, 1870, microchips.

308
00:29:58,541 --> 00:30:03,755
But I'm not much of a
technical person, you know.

309
00:30:06,883 --> 00:30:11,054
You been here before?
You look kind of familiar.

310
00:30:11,089 --> 00:30:13,139
Name's Douglas Hall.

311
00:30:19,396 --> 00:30:20,438
It doesn't ring a bell.

312
00:30:22,524 --> 00:30:25,652
Guess you just have
one of those faces...

313
00:30:25,687 --> 00:30:27,737
...familiar faces.
Oh, it's late.

314
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,865
I'd like to close up now.

315
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,951
Of course.

316
00:30:35,036 --> 00:30:37,122
- Pleasure.
- Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Hall.

317
00:31:11,531 --> 00:31:14,659
1257 Palo Alto Road,
La Cienega Heights.

318
00:31:15,702 --> 00:31:16,745
I guess that's it.

319
00:31:21,958 --> 00:31:24,044
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Bridget Manilla.

320
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:26,094
What do you want her for?

321
00:31:26,129 --> 00:31:30,300
- I want to ask her some questions.
- She got a job now. I'm her mother.

322
00:31:31,343 --> 00:31:33,428
Can you tell me
where I can find her?

323
00:31:33,463 --> 00:31:35,513
You a copper?

324
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:38,607
Now, listen.

325
00:31:38,642 --> 00:31:41,248
She ain't doing
nothing wrong no more.

326
00:31:41,283 --> 00:31:43,820
If you don't cause her no trouble...

327
00:31:43,855 --> 00:31:46,983
...you'll find her
at Wilshire Grand Hotel.

328
00:32:42,247 --> 00:32:44,332
Welcome to the Wilshire Grand Hotel.

329
00:32:55,802 --> 00:32:57,852
I'm looking for Bridget Manilla.

330
00:32:57,887 --> 00:33:01,016
She's over there,
second from the end.

331
00:33:07,272 --> 00:33:08,315
Bridget?

332
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,485
I got your name from
a good friend of mine.

333
00:33:13,528 --> 00:33:15,613
Come back later.
I'm really busy right now.

334
00:33:15,648 --> 00:33:16,656
His name's Fuller.

335
00:33:17,699 --> 00:33:21,870
The manager's very tough on us.
You'll have to wait till I'm off duty.

336
00:33:22,912 --> 00:33:26,041
I really don't think
I can wait that long.

337
00:33:28,126 --> 00:33:30,211
Go talk to Ashton over at the bar.

338
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:35,425
Bridget, do we have
your attention now?

339
00:33:36,468 --> 00:33:37,510
Thank you. Let's go.

340
00:33:38,553 --> 00:33:41,681
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Ashton.

341
00:33:41,716 --> 00:33:42,689
Right there.

342
00:33:42,724 --> 00:33:45,852
Ashton, some guy wants you.

343
00:33:46,895 --> 00:33:50,023
You're a lucky man.
I just opened.

344
00:33:53,151 --> 00:33:55,236
Oh, my. Something wrong?

345
00:33:58,365 --> 00:34:00,450
Bridget just sent me over here.

346
00:34:00,485 --> 00:34:02,535
What can I do you for?

347
00:34:03,578 --> 00:34:05,629
You know a gentleman
named Hannon Fuller?

348
00:34:05,664 --> 00:34:09,834
Gin martini up, one olive and
likes them frigid as an Eskimo.

349
00:34:10,877 --> 00:34:12,927
- Talk to him recently?
- Why?

350
00:34:12,962 --> 00:34:15,048
I'm his friend.
He didn't come home last night...

351
00:34:16,091 --> 00:34:19,219
...and his wife is concerned.
My name is Douglas Hall.

352
00:34:25,475 --> 00:34:27,525
Concerned wives?

353
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,645
I can't help you with that.

354
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,731
How about something fancy?

355
00:34:31,766 --> 00:34:33,782
So did...

356
00:34:33,817 --> 00:34:36,945
Does Fuller come here frequently?

357
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:38,005
You could say that.

358
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:38,995
What does he do?

359
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:42,158
What everybody does:
drinks, dances, has a good time.

360
00:34:42,193 --> 00:34:44,782
Especially has a good time.

361
00:34:44,817 --> 00:34:47,372
He really goes for the girls.

362
00:34:48,415 --> 00:34:49,457
Girls?

363
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,585
Thought you said you knew him.

364
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:54,671
Yeah, I thought I did.

365
00:34:57,799 --> 00:34:58,842
Are you in a hurry or something?

366
00:34:59,884 --> 00:35:03,013
Did you happen to talk to Fuller
the night before last?

367
00:35:04,055 --> 00:35:05,098
Yes, I did.

368
00:35:06,141 --> 00:35:09,269
Did he mention my name?
Did he give you something for me?

369
00:35:10,312 --> 00:35:11,319
What would that be?

370
00:35:11,354 --> 00:35:13,961
- A message or a note, maybe.
- No, sorry.

371
00:35:13,996 --> 00:35:16,568
Did you see him talking
to anybody else?

372
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:18,653
I'm a very busy man.

373
00:35:25,952 --> 00:35:26,995
Listen...

374
00:35:28,038 --> 00:35:31,166
...if you like, I can arrange
something for you too.

375
00:35:32,208 --> 00:35:35,337
You see anything you want?

376
00:35:43,678 --> 00:35:46,806
Can you tell me where
the bathroom is, please?

377
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:06,618
Timer engaged and counting.

378
00:36:41,027 --> 00:36:43,113
Douglas Hall! Hey, man!

379
00:36:43,148 --> 00:36:45,198
You all right?

380
00:36:46,241 --> 00:36:49,369
You sure?
All right, take it easy.

381
00:36:51,454 --> 00:36:53,540
Hey, man. Take it easy.

382
00:36:55,625 --> 00:36:57,676
I told you, 120 minutes.

383
00:36:57,711 --> 00:37:00,839
It's too long.
You're really pushing your luck.

384
00:37:00,874 --> 00:37:03,967
I need something to drink.
Some water.

385
00:37:06,052 --> 00:37:09,180
Mr. Hall, you forgot
your coat and hat.

386
00:37:18,565 --> 00:37:21,693
Name's Ferguson.
Johnny Ferguson.

387
00:37:28,992 --> 00:37:31,042
Anything wrong?

388
00:37:31,077 --> 00:37:32,120
Didn't finish your drink.

389
00:37:33,163 --> 00:37:36,256
- What happened?
- What happened?

390
00:37:36,291 --> 00:37:38,376
The memory transference
with your link...

391
00:37:38,411 --> 00:37:40,462
...it froze.
Started overlapping!

392
00:37:42,547 --> 00:37:45,675
Thought I'd be shooting hoops
with Ferguson forever.

393
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:47,761
You got a smoke?

394
00:37:48,803 --> 00:37:49,846
Sure.

395
00:37:50,889 --> 00:37:51,931
Thank you.

396
00:37:58,188 --> 00:38:00,273
Mind if I ask you a question?

397
00:38:02,359 --> 00:38:04,444
Can you tell me where I am?

398
00:38:07,572 --> 00:38:09,658
It works?

399
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,786
Oh, it works!

400
00:38:14,871 --> 00:38:15,914
It works.

401
00:38:17,999 --> 00:38:19,007
How about Ashton?

402
00:38:19,042 --> 00:38:22,170
- My bartender?
- He's got a better haircut than you.

403
00:38:22,205 --> 00:38:23,213
Much better.

404
00:38:25,298 --> 00:38:27,384
I wish I could see it for myself.

405
00:38:28,426 --> 00:38:31,519
How's the lighting? Textures?

406
00:38:31,554 --> 00:38:34,683
Colourization needs work,
but the units don't notice.

407
00:38:35,725 --> 00:38:37,776
What are they like?

408
00:38:37,811 --> 00:38:40,939
They're as real as you and me.

409
00:38:41,982 --> 00:38:45,110
You see, the old man was right!
All those years of work!

410
00:38:46,152 --> 00:38:48,238
Did you find out
what he was doing there?

411
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,366
He was having sex with girls.

412
00:38:53,451 --> 00:38:54,494
You're kidding me.

413
00:38:55,537 --> 00:38:57,587
Excuse me, Mr. Hall?

414
00:38:57,622 --> 00:38:59,708
A man in the lobby says
he needs to talk to you.

415
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:02,801
Thanks. Have him call
my office in the morning.

416
00:39:02,836 --> 00:39:07,007
He says it's urgent.
That he's a friend of Fuller's.

417
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:25,775
So, you're a friend of Fuller's.

418
00:39:26,818 --> 00:39:27,861
You're Hall, right?

419
00:39:28,903 --> 00:39:29,946
How can I help you, Mr...

420
00:39:29,981 --> 00:39:31,997
Tom Jones.

421
00:39:32,032 --> 00:39:34,117
You know, like the singer.

422
00:39:37,245 --> 00:39:38,288
How about some privacy?

423
00:39:39,331 --> 00:39:41,416
What do you want to talk about?

424
00:39:41,451 --> 00:39:43,501
About the night the old man died.

425
00:39:46,629 --> 00:39:48,715
I'll be right back, Joe.

426
00:39:58,099 --> 00:40:00,184
So where'd you meet Fuller?

427
00:40:00,219 --> 00:40:02,270
In my bar the other night...

428
00:40:02,305 --> 00:40:04,356
...waiting for you.

429
00:40:07,484 --> 00:40:09,569
Is that what you wanted
to talk to me about?

430
00:40:12,697 --> 00:40:14,748
No, I want to talk about money now.

431
00:40:14,783 --> 00:40:17,911
- Something in the seven figures.
- What money?

432
00:40:18,953 --> 00:40:21,039
Come on.

433
00:40:22,082 --> 00:40:24,167
You think you can
get away with it?

434
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:29,210
Get away with what?

435
00:40:31,466 --> 00:40:34,594
You took the old man, asshole!

436
00:40:35,637 --> 00:40:37,687
Listen to me.
He was at the bar.

437
00:40:37,722 --> 00:40:41,893
You pick him up, leave together.
Next day he's an obit.

438
00:40:41,928 --> 00:40:43,979
You do the math, asshole!

439
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,363
Oh, Jesus!

440
00:40:56,491 --> 00:40:58,576
Crazy son of a bitch!

441
00:41:00,662 --> 00:41:01,705
You're nuts.

442
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:05,875
I'll see you on
America's Most Wanted.

443
00:41:24,644 --> 00:41:26,730
Omni Hotel.
How can I help you?

444
00:41:27,772 --> 00:41:29,858
Miss Jane Fuller, please.

445
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:32,986
Hello? Who is this?

446
00:41:37,157 --> 00:41:40,285
On the night
your father was killed...

447
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,335
...he tried to reach me.

448
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:44,456
He wanted to meet at some bar.

449
00:41:44,491 --> 00:41:45,463
What for?

450
00:41:45,498 --> 00:41:47,584
He felt someone was after him.

451
00:41:48,626 --> 00:41:49,669
Did you talk to him?

452
00:41:51,755 --> 00:41:53,840
I know how strange this sounds.

453
00:41:53,875 --> 00:41:54,883
I can't remember.

454
00:41:55,925 --> 00:41:58,011
What do you mean?

455
00:42:00,096 --> 00:42:03,224
Did you talk to
the detective about this?

456
00:42:04,267 --> 00:42:05,310
No, but the bartender will...

457
00:42:06,353 --> 00:42:08,438
...if I don't pay up.

458
00:42:09,481 --> 00:42:10,488
Christ!

459
00:42:10,523 --> 00:42:12,609
I know how crazy this sounds.

460
00:42:13,652 --> 00:42:15,737
You can't just plug your brain
into this machine...

461
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:18,865
...and not expect
to be affected by it.

462
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:24,079
Please walk away from this
before you get hurt too.

463
00:42:26,164 --> 00:42:28,249
Why do I get the feeling
we've met before?

464
00:42:31,378 --> 00:42:33,463
Maybe we have, in another life.

465
00:42:34,506 --> 00:42:37,634
What about Paris?
What's that other life like?

466
00:42:37,669 --> 00:42:40,727
- I don't want to talk about it.
- Why not?

467
00:42:40,762 --> 00:42:43,890
I guess I don't want you
to lose interest in me.

468
00:42:45,976 --> 00:42:48,061
Don't worry about that.

469
00:42:52,232 --> 00:42:53,239
Let's dance.

470
00:42:53,274 --> 00:42:55,359
- Me? No, no.
- Yes, come on.

471
00:42:55,394 --> 00:42:57,445
I buy all my shoes in left pairs.

472
00:42:58,488 --> 00:43:00,573
It's easy.
I'll show you the steps.

473
00:43:17,257 --> 00:43:20,385
You're doing pretty good
for a man with no right foot.

474
00:43:21,428 --> 00:43:24,556
Must've picked it up in another life.

475
00:43:34,983 --> 00:43:38,111
You know that feeling you have
that we met before?

476
00:43:44,367 --> 00:43:45,410
It's the same with me.

477
00:43:46,453 --> 00:43:47,460
Why is that?

478
00:43:47,495 --> 00:43:50,623
They say that déjà vu
is usually a sign of...

479
00:43:51,666 --> 00:43:53,752
...love at first sight.

480
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:37,545
Go, go. Ready!

481
00:44:40,674 --> 00:44:42,759
Don't make any sudden moves.

482
00:44:43,802 --> 00:44:44,809
What's this all about?

483
00:44:44,844 --> 00:44:46,930
What it's usually all about.

484
00:44:47,973 --> 00:44:48,980
Murder.

485
00:44:49,015 --> 00:44:50,058
Is that your car?

486
00:44:51,101 --> 00:44:53,151
- Those are my plates.
- No shit.

487
00:44:53,186 --> 00:44:56,314
That's from a security camera
in your office garage...

488
00:44:56,349 --> 00:44:59,442
- ... the night Fuller was killed.
- I don't understand.

489
00:44:59,477 --> 00:45:01,493
That makes one of us.

490
00:45:01,528 --> 00:45:05,699
Fuller wanted to shut down the project,
and you sliced him up.

491
00:45:05,734 --> 00:45:06,741
It's time I call my attorney.

492
00:45:07,784 --> 00:45:08,792
You say you left at 10.

493
00:45:08,827 --> 00:45:10,912
I was working late with Whitney.

494
00:45:10,947 --> 00:45:12,998
Anybody with you?

495
00:45:18,211 --> 00:45:20,296
You're picking up bad habits
left and right.

496
00:45:23,425 --> 00:45:24,467
Must be the stress.

497
00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:26,553
Then you'll need a carton.

498
00:45:28,638 --> 00:45:31,766
Name's Tom Jones. Said he saw
your picture in the paper.

499
00:45:32,809 --> 00:45:36,980
Said you looked like the guy
Fuller left the bar with that night.

500
00:45:37,015 --> 00:45:40,108
We took his statement.
Said we'd be in touch.

501
00:45:41,151 --> 00:45:43,236
Somebody reached out
and touched him first.

502
00:46:05,133 --> 00:46:06,176
Looks like you found an alibi.

503
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:17,646
You're free to go...

504
00:46:17,681 --> 00:46:18,688
...for now.

505
00:46:25,987 --> 00:46:27,030
What did you tell him?

506
00:46:27,065 --> 00:46:28,073
The truth.

507
00:46:29,115 --> 00:46:31,166
We met for a drink,
one thing led to another...

508
00:46:31,201 --> 00:46:35,372
...we spent the night together.
Your picture was on the news.

509
00:46:35,407 --> 00:46:37,457
He saw you and thought
you were good for quick cash.

510
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:40,585
You should've seen the pictures.
The guy was slaughtered.

511
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:43,678
He was an ex-con.
Who knows what else he did!

512
00:46:43,713 --> 00:46:46,841
Just because I don't remember it
doesn't mean I didn't do it.

513
00:46:47,884 --> 00:46:48,927
You're not a killer.

514
00:46:49,970 --> 00:46:52,020
Your father stumbled onto something.

515
00:46:52,055 --> 00:46:55,183
He left me a message
having something to do with this.

516
00:46:55,218 --> 00:46:56,226
So what are you going to do?

517
00:46:57,268 --> 00:46:59,354
Jack back in and find out.

518
00:47:08,738 --> 00:47:10,824
Downloading.
Time.: Two hours.

519
00:47:11,866 --> 00:47:13,917
Engage timer.

520
00:47:13,952 --> 00:47:17,080
Timer not engaged. Warning!

521
00:47:19,165 --> 00:47:20,208
Timer not engaged.

522
00:47:21,251 --> 00:47:22,293
Warning.

523
00:47:28,550 --> 00:47:30,635
We're up next!

524
00:47:38,977 --> 00:47:41,062
- Ready? Come on.
- What?!

525
00:47:45,233 --> 00:47:46,276
What's wrong?

526
00:47:46,311 --> 00:47:47,319
Come on, John!

527
00:47:51,489 --> 00:47:52,532
What are you doing?

528
00:47:54,617 --> 00:47:57,746
We're gonna be disqualified!

529
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:12,344
- Here you go.
- Thanks a lot, chief.

530
00:48:27,984 --> 00:48:29,027
Come on!

531
00:48:31,112 --> 00:48:32,155
Grierson!

532
00:48:43,625 --> 00:48:45,675
I'll call the police!

533
00:48:45,710 --> 00:48:47,796
- I need to talk to you!
- I told you!

534
00:48:47,831 --> 00:48:48,838
I'll call the police!

535
00:48:49,881 --> 00:48:50,889
Listen. Listen!

536
00:48:50,924 --> 00:48:54,017
I know why you pass out
from time to time.

537
00:48:54,052 --> 00:48:57,180
I know why you wake up
and have no idea where you are.

538
00:48:57,215 --> 00:49:00,308
What'd you do three nights ago?
Any idea?

539
00:49:04,479 --> 00:49:06,564
When did it first happen?

540
00:49:06,599 --> 00:49:08,650
First time?

541
00:49:09,693 --> 00:49:11,778
About four weeks ago.

542
00:49:12,821 --> 00:49:14,906
And the last episode
was three nights ago?

543
00:49:14,941 --> 00:49:18,034
It lasts for about two hours?

544
00:49:21,162 --> 00:49:24,290
My wife thinks
I have a secret love life.

545
00:49:24,325 --> 00:49:26,376
What about...

546
00:49:28,461 --> 00:49:31,589
...memory flashes, déjà vu?

547
00:49:31,624 --> 00:49:32,597
I was in World War I.

548
00:49:32,632 --> 00:49:36,803
I'm still having these nightmares.

549
00:49:36,838 --> 00:49:37,846
I'm talking about fantasies.

550
00:49:43,059 --> 00:49:44,067
I do have them.

551
00:49:44,102 --> 00:49:48,273
In these fantasies,
you're having sex with young girls.

552
00:49:54,529 --> 00:49:56,614
When I wake up...

553
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:00,785
...I even have a perfume smell...

554
00:50:01,828 --> 00:50:03,913
- ... all over me.
- Real or imagined?

555
00:50:07,042 --> 00:50:09,127
According to my wife...

556
00:50:11,212 --> 00:50:12,255
...it's pretty real.

557
00:50:39,366 --> 00:50:41,416
I found this...

558
00:50:41,451 --> 00:50:43,536
...a couple of days ago.

559
00:50:43,571 --> 00:50:44,544
Your size?

560
00:50:44,579 --> 00:50:48,750
I am married over 35 years now.

561
00:50:49,793 --> 00:50:53,963
And not once have I cheated on my wife.

562
00:50:55,006 --> 00:50:57,092
Not once.

563
00:50:58,134 --> 00:50:59,177
Let's have a drink.
