1
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,225
As you can see,

2
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,730
our Cultural Attache Department
has extended our ESL program

3
00:04:23,765 --> 00:04:28,442
to the rest of Bulgaria
with extraordinary results.

4
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:31,044
Sofia Private School
has the best scores in the country.

5
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:33,594
I think you should give
each and every one of yourselves

6
00:04:33,629 --> 00:04:36,110
a round of applause
for this extraordinary accomplishment.

7
00:04:36,145 --> 00:04:37,110
[applause]

8
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,058
Aah!

9
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:48,273
[groaning]

10
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:50,609
No witnesses.

11
00:05:57,858 --> 00:06:01,283
[beeping]

12
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:22,887
[bellydance music plays]

13
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:18,609
[speaking Bulgarian]

14
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:22,484
So how's the good doctor this evening?

15
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:25,737
Happy to have the company
of my old friend.

16
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,423
Attractive, huh?

17
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:42,716
Yes, very.

18
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:46,926
So what's it been now, Robert, hmm?

19
00:07:46,961 --> 00:07:49,519
Three years? Four?

20
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:53,648
It's been four years today, actually.

21
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:57,519
Look around, my friend.

22
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:00,695
If you wanted to,

23
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:04,075
you could go home
with a different one every night.

24
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,035
It's not exactly my style,
you know that.

25
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,447
What, then?

26
00:08:10,482 --> 00:08:11,825
[sighs]

27
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:15,792
Ah, you're still punishing yourself

28
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,874
about the accident, are you?

29
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:21,549
Oh, Robert, you need to
deal with it, my friend.

30
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:25,088
I know what carrying that kind
of burden around can do to you.

31
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:28,473
I appreciate your concern as always,

32
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,810
but as long as I stay here
in Eastern Europe,

33
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:34,849
all of that stays back in New York.
Out of sight, out of mind.

34
00:08:34,884 --> 00:08:36,350
Well, that's...

35
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:39,440
It doesn't work that way, my friend.

36
00:08:39,475 --> 00:08:40,562
I think you need therapy.

37
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,482
I'll tell you what I do need.
I need a drink.

38
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,025
Where's our waitress?

39
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,115
[sighs]

40
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:51,619
[sighs again]

41
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:56,661
[passing sirens]

42
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,711
[dog barking]

43
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:35,659
[laughs quietly]

44
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:40,475
So, Vicki, how are we today, hmm?

45
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:42,494
I'm okay.

46
00:10:42,529 --> 00:10:44,442
Good.

47
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:47,731
Any more memory lapses, hmm?

48
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,445
Any more bad dreams?

49
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:56,915
I sense that you're
avoiding conversation today.

50
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:06,333
Perhaps you'll indulge me
in a brief activity, hmm?

51
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:19,809
It's a hypnotic technique we use
to open a patient's senses,

52
00:11:19,844 --> 00:11:22,102
to tap into the imagination.

53
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:27,021
It's really quite harmless.
You can trust me.

54
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:29,610
You're not afraid of a simple
little blindfold, are you?

55
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:33,618
You can remove it
whenever you want to.

56
00:11:33,653 --> 00:11:35,032
I promise.

57
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:44,727
And just relax.

58
00:11:44,762 --> 00:11:48,713
Breathe and relax.

59
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:55,056
Now, I asked you about your dreams.

60
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:00,770
Any recently that you recall?

61
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:05,062
Yes, one.

62
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:07,689
Go on.

63
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,815
It's embarrassing, actually.

64
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:17,738
It's like a re-creation
from something I read long ago.

65
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:22,417
Have you read Hubert Selby, Jr.,
Last Exit to Brooklyn?

66
00:12:22,452 --> 00:12:24,661
No, I can't say I have

67
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:29,631
There is this part at the end

68
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:35,423
where this junkie chick
climbs into an abandoned car

69
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:39,057
and lets every guy
in the neighborhood screw her.

70
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:45,896
Every scumbag and lowlife
for miles around get in this line,

71
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:48,566
and the line
goes around the block.

72
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:52,356
How did it affect you, the scene,
when you read it?

73
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:56,659
At the time, it was disturbing.

74
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:02,573
But in this dream...

75
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:09,460
I'm the girl in the abandoned car.

76
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:15,316
I can never see their faces.

77
00:13:15,351 --> 00:13:19,310
They're hidden by keffiyehs,

78
00:13:19,345 --> 00:13:22,537
you know, those Arabic scarves.

79
00:13:22,572 --> 00:13:25,523
They're pulled over their faces,

80
00:13:25,558 --> 00:13:28,475
and every one of those men...

81
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:30,561
Go on.

82
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:32,819
They're all the same man.

83
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,274
Have you thought who he might be...

84
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:40,779
the man wearing the keffiyeh?

85
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:44,203
[internalized screaming]

86
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:49,920
DR. KAHN: Vicki?

87
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:53,131
Vicki?

88
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,543
- Vicki?
- What?

89
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:57,510
You blanked out there.

90
00:13:57,545 --> 00:14:02,176
Went somewhere else
as you answered my questions.

91
00:14:02,211 --> 00:14:03,802
I did?

92
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:05,686
Answered your questions?

93
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,440
What questions?
What did I say?

94
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:13,775
Well, you were away
for several moments.

95
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:16,189
You don't remember
what we were talking about?

96
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:21,782
No, I don't remember.

97
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,039
[bell rings]

98
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:37,169
MAN: One moment, please.

99
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:40,088
Oh, here she is now.

100
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:42,174
This is the man
from the embassy, Vicki.

101
00:14:42,209 --> 00:14:43,473
Robert Diggs.

102
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:45,534
Please meet my wife, Vicki Denov.

103
00:14:45,569 --> 00:14:47,561
Pleased to meet you. Call me Vicki.

104
00:14:47,596 --> 00:14:48,686
Sure.

105
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,894
So you'll be spending some time
with us today then?

106
00:14:50,929 --> 00:14:52,440
Yes, that's correct.

107
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:54,227
Your English is excellent,
by the way.

108
00:14:54,262 --> 00:14:55,479
It better be.

109
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:57,856
Shall we? I'm running late.

110
00:14:57,891 --> 00:14:59,573
Sure. It's a pleasure.

111
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:01,115
Bye.

112
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,323
[speaking Bulgarian]

113
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:11,327
VICKI: Proper nouns includes words
like Sofia and Bulgaria.

114
00:15:11,362 --> 00:15:15,749
When writing proper nouns,
you capitalize the first letter.

115
00:15:15,784 --> 00:15:18,092
Pavo, can you give us examples
of proper nouns?

116
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:22,011
Atea, Mexico,

117
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:25,306
New York, Istanbul,

118
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:28,345
Washington, Mexico City,

119
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,812

[students laugh]

124
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:57,588
Very good. You may sit.

125
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:01,469
Remember:
names, places, and titles.

126

[computer beeps]

128
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,164
I'm going to the ambassador's office.

129
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:38,998
[knock on door]

130
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,798
- Robert Diggs.
- Ambassador.

131
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:44,969
Good to finally meet you.

132
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,597
Pleasure's all mine, ambassador.

133
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:49,950
Sorry to drag you in like this.

134
00:16:49,985 --> 00:16:51,392
Well, I have to admit, sir,

135
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,646
that your email did
arouse my curiosity.

136
00:16:53,681 --> 00:16:55,855
[chuckles]
Let's get some air.

137
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,857
DIGGS: Project Sofia?
Sure, I remember.

138
00:16:57,892 --> 00:17:01,772
A counter-terrorism program
based here in the city, defunct now.

139
00:17:01,807 --> 00:17:04,741
Yes. Black ops.

140
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:08,282
A lot of fuss in the press
about it here, though.

141
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:12,995
Our agents were good guys,
really great.

142
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:14,916
They've been able to infiltrate

143
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:18,797
some of the best organized
terrorist-radical groups

144
00:17:18,832 --> 00:17:21,127
from New York to Madrid,

145
00:17:21,162 --> 00:17:23,382
and they were not able-

146
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:26,591
not able to get into Sofia, ever.

147
00:17:26,626 --> 00:17:28,679
Not then, not now.

148
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:33,345
I gotta talk to you about
what's going on with Sofia today.

149
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:35,514
I thought it was dead in the water.

150
00:17:35,549 --> 00:17:38,062
Yeah. Seemed to be

151
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,234
until yesterday.

152
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:46,322
Yeah, I read about this this morning.

153
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:51,409
Hmm. I've been on the phone all night
with the States dealing with this.

154
00:17:51,444 --> 00:17:54,624
Turns out Washington
knows all about the fella

155
00:17:54,659 --> 00:17:56,791
this vigilante terminated.

156
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:59,710
He was a target
of highest priority for us,

157
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:02,755
and we've never been able
to get anywhere near him.

158
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,794
Oh, I guess the guys back home
are feeling some heat from higher up,

159
00:18:05,829 --> 00:18:09,095
and now they want to find out
exactly what's going on here.

160
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:14,102
So I have been specifically instructed
to, quote, unquote, persuade you

161
00:18:14,137 --> 00:18:16,391
to take charge of
the investigation here.

162
00:18:16,426 --> 00:18:17,353
Why me?

163
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:19,452
Because you are exemplary.

164
00:18:19,487 --> 00:18:21,482
- [scoffs]
- No, seriously.

165
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:24,487
That's what your FBI friends called
you. They said you were exemplary.

166
00:18:24,522 --> 00:18:28,403
I've never had anybody say
I was exemplary in my whole life.

167
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,199
Leaving law enforcement

168
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:32,862
was a well-thought-out decision
on my part, ambassador.

169
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:38,082
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

170
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:41,872
I know. They told me about that,
and I'm truly sorry.

171
00:18:41,907 --> 00:18:43,170
Come on.

172
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:45,523
But it seems that the ramifications of

173
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:48,086
this are very
big-politically, globally.

174
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:55,136
See, these vigilantes have taken on
a whole string of high-profile targets,

175
00:18:55,171 --> 00:18:58,102
targets your FBI guys
told me on the phone last night

176
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:02,017
that they've been tracking for years
and could never get a look at.

177
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,317
So now they need to know

178
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:08,482
how come these vigilantes
can get inside when they can't?

179
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,364
And who are they, these guys?

180
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:13,027
And what do they know?
How do they know it?

181
00:19:13,062 --> 00:19:14,798
And why them, not us?

182
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:16,495
What intel do we have?

183
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:20,868
They tell me that some militant
is setting up safe houses.

184

but he knows they're here in villages.

a number of times,

emboldened him and...

00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:17,527
All right.

331
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:26,370
Mr. Diggs.

332
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:29,001
A couple of people I want you to meet.

333
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:32,759
Officer Aleksander Mulichev,
Officer Greg Ospasov.

334
00:37:32,794 --> 00:37:35,721
Sofia's best,
and they both speak English.

335
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:40,384
[speaking Bulgarian]

336
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:43,017
Gregor Ospasov. A pleasure.

337
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:45,271
Great to meet you.
Please call me Aleks.

338
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:49,817
They're gonna give you all the help
that local law enforcement can provide.

339
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:51,351
They're good guys.

340
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:53,150
Trust them with your life.

341
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:20,220
[speaking Bulgarian]

342
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:28,140
The deceased is an explosives expert,
affiliated with Islamic Jihad.

343
00:38:28,175 --> 00:38:29,439
Of course.

344
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:31,775
The killer shot the dog, also.

345
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:34,939
This is the 12th connected killing
you've seen in six months?

346
00:38:34,974 --> 00:38:36,905
Yeah, that's right,

347
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:39,032
and just one piece
of forensic evidence,

348
00:38:39,067 --> 00:38:42,032
a Romanian brand of cigarette butt
with lipstick

349
00:38:42,067 --> 00:38:44,998
was found on the sidewalk
near one of the killings.

350
00:38:45,033 --> 00:38:46,039
It could belong to anyone.

351
00:38:46,074 --> 00:38:50,580
There is also a melted VHS tape
from an Arabic souvenir shop.

352
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:53,920
Completely clean. Untraceable.

353
00:38:53,955 --> 00:38:56,464
Unknown origin.

354
00:38:56,918 --> 00:39:00,092
DIGGS: So, now we've got
a long-range sniper killing.

355
00:39:00,127 --> 00:39:02,931
Any forensic evidence
at the shooter's post?

356
00:39:02,966 --> 00:39:05,389
Gunshot residue, hairs,
fibers, shells, anything?

357
00:39:05,424 --> 00:39:08,855
We're working on it.
Sifting the dirt.

358
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:15,107
[speaking Bulgarian]

359
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:38,175
600 meters.

360
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:43,342
Robert Diggs. U.S. Embassy.

361
00:39:43,377 --> 00:39:45,805
I'm gonna go take a look.

362
00:40:16,998 --> 00:40:18,500
Robert?

363
00:40:35,642 --> 00:40:37,859
Nah. If that were the case,

364
00:40:37,894 --> 00:40:41,364
the body would have wound up
somewhere over here in this proximity.

365
00:40:41,399 --> 00:40:44,574
No, the killer let
him finish his prayer,

366
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:47,112
and then hit when he stood up
and was just about to turn.

367
00:40:47,147 --> 00:40:48,703
That's why the body wound up here.

368
00:40:48,738 --> 00:40:51,457
So that means the shots
didn't come from there.

369
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:54,418
They came from there.

370
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:57,247
Huh?

371
00:41:22,397 --> 00:41:24,741
Hey, look at this.

372
00:41:26,526 --> 00:41:28,403
Marks from a rifle stand, huh?

373
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:52,518
[breathing heavily]

374
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:57,016
[laughing]

375
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:16,701
[bell chimes]

376
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:33,518
[gasping]

377
00:43:16,177 --> 00:43:17,349
Vicki.

378
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:20,723
[speaking Bulgarian]

379
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:38,291
[speaking Bulgarian]

380
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:57,695
Vicki...

381
00:45:27,183 --> 00:45:28,691
Oh, I completely understand.

382
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:31,320
Hey, look, I'll have to
call you right back, okay?

383
00:45:32,355 --> 00:45:33,982
The printout you asked for.

384
00:45:36,359 --> 00:45:39,408
This is all they were able to retrieve
from the VHS tape?

385
00:45:39,443 --> 00:45:40,780
Sorry, it was too damaged.

386
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:44,204
- Even with the enhancement?
- Even with.

387
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:52,463
[speaking Bulgarian]

388
00:45:58,547 --> 00:46:00,223
This just came in.

389
00:46:00,258 --> 00:46:01,724
We've gone international.

390
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:04,603
The press picked on the Jinn murders.

391
00:46:04,638 --> 00:46:06,702
Son of a bitch.

392
00:46:06,737 --> 00:46:08,502
Have you seen this?

393
00:46:08,537 --> 00:46:10,233
It's not my fault.

394
00:46:10,268 --> 00:46:12,191
This was leaked by
your friends back home.

395
00:46:12,226 --> 00:46:13,361
Sit down.

396
00:46:13,396 --> 00:46:14,987
I told them I thought they were nuts,

397
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:16,945
but they said that they wanted
the world to know

398
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:19,194
that they had their best man
on the case.

399
00:46:19,229 --> 00:46:20,409
With all due respect, sir,

400
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:23,789
was there any thought given
to compromising the investigation?

401
00:46:23,824 --> 00:46:27,250
I'm a political appointee.
I have this job

402
00:46:27,285 --> 00:46:30,084
because I gave the president's
election committee a bag of money.

403
00:46:30,119 --> 00:46:31,712
I don't get to make decisions.

404
00:46:31,747 --> 00:46:34,500
They want this out there,
well, it's out there.

405
00:46:35,251 --> 00:46:37,051
The best case I can suggest is,

406
00:46:37,086 --> 00:46:39,760
maybe it'll rouse up a person
of interest. I don't know.

407
00:46:39,795 --> 00:46:41,055
They're desperate. I told you that.

408
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:43,684
You think tipping our hand like this
is gonna help expedite that?

409
00:46:43,719 --> 00:46:46,811
Robert, I am the messenger.
Don't shoot me.

410
00:46:46,846 --> 00:46:50,100
They didn't like your fried videotape,
so they said they were going with this.

411
00:46:50,135 --> 00:46:52,441
I have car dealerships at home.

412
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:53,985
I can get you a great deal on wheels,

413
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:58,150
but I have to admit I'm a little bit
over my head on this stuff.

414
00:46:58,185 --> 00:47:00,243
Bulgaria was not the post I wanted.

415
00:47:00,278 --> 00:47:01,409
I was hoping for Paris.

416
00:47:01,444 --> 00:47:03,494
That's what they hinted at, Paris.

417
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:05,873
Oh, maybe I didn't give them
enough money.

418
00:47:05,908 --> 00:47:07,832
I don't know. [sighs]

419
00:47:07,867 --> 00:47:10,807
Your guys want results, Robert.

420
00:47:10,842 --> 00:47:13,748
We are doing the best we can.

421
00:47:18,419 --> 00:47:19,762
[beep]

422
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:24,471
DIGGS: That was a lucky find,
the art exhibit.

423
00:47:24,506 --> 00:47:26,475
URSULA: He's a local painter.

424
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:29,478
Funny, I don't think I've ever
come across one before.

425
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:32,266
Maybe you just haven't been
paying attention to what's around you.

426
00:47:32,301 --> 00:47:33,688
Maybe not.

427
00:47:36,771 --> 00:47:40,150
So what made you come to Sofia?

428
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:44,988
Change of scenery, new opportunities,
that sort of thing.

429
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:49,583
And you like your employer,
the government of the U.S.?

430
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:52,835
[laughs] Yeah, fine.

431
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:54,793
What about you?
You like what you do?

432
00:47:54,828 --> 00:47:56,086
I love it.

433
00:47:57,917 --> 00:48:00,636
I'd like to live in
the mountains one day,

434
00:48:00,671 --> 00:48:02,380
away from the city.

435
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:25,569
I have to go.

436
00:48:26,862 --> 00:48:29,288
Really? So soon?

437
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:31,121
What time do you go on tonight?
I'd love to come and see you.

438
00:48:31,784 --> 00:48:32,784
No, not tonight.

439
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:35,462
I'm sorry, Robert. I have to go.

440
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:40,294
You're very nice, Robert.

441
00:48:40,329 --> 00:48:42,257
I'd like it if you call me.

442
00:48:43,379 --> 00:48:44,676
Okay, I will.

443
00:49:07,445 --> 00:49:11,325
MAN: Next target, Abdullah Said.

444
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:14,793
[dog barks]

445
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:21,960
[beeping]

446
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:31,135
[speaking Turkish]

447
00:49:43,606 --> 00:49:45,984
[speaking Arabic]

448
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:10,679
[frustrated sigh]

449
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:24,363
[exhales]

450
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:07,531
Heh.

451
00:51:13,529 --> 00:51:15,202
Wait a minute.

452
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:18,451
It's a bag.

453
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:21,579
That's it.

454
00:51:31,046 --> 00:51:33,014
The last time we were together,

455
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:38,562
you became agitated when I mentioned
your parents, remember?

456
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:41,390
When I asked you if you missed them?

457
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:43,099
Now...

458
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:47,963
I want you to cast
your mind back, Vicki.

459
00:51:47,998 --> 00:51:50,741
I want you to think about
that little girl,

460
00:51:51,692 --> 00:51:55,822
what life was like for her
after her parents died.

461
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:22,264
Aah!

462
00:52:28,771 --> 00:52:30,819
Aah!

463
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:37,155
[screaming]

464
00:53:10,479 --> 00:53:17,112
Now... I'm going to ask you some
questions that may seem strange,

465
00:53:18,070 --> 00:53:21,620
but I want you to answer them
naturally, okay?

466
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:26,871
Now, lie back, get comfortable.

467
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,093
All right, good.

468
00:53:34,128 --> 00:53:38,474
And relax and breathe.

469
00:53:38,509 --> 00:53:40,182
Breathe.

470
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:42,970
Will you take off your glasses, please?

471
00:53:53,021 --> 00:53:54,989
Tell me your full name.

472
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:59,034
Victoria Denov.

473
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:00,696
What year were you born in?

474
00:54:02,406 --> 00:54:06,377
1970s... Seventy-...

475
00:54:06,412 --> 00:54:09,838
'77, I think.

476
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:11,920
What city were you born in?

477
00:54:14,543 --> 00:54:16,261
Sofia.

478
00:54:17,546 --> 00:54:21,301
No, Paris.

479
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:24,393
Wait...

480
00:54:24,428 --> 00:54:26,647
DR. KAHN:
What is your mother's first name?

481
00:54:26,682 --> 00:54:28,772
Your mother's first name, Vicki.

482
00:54:28,807 --> 00:54:30,980
Now, you must try and answer
these questions.

483
00:54:31,015 --> 00:54:34,528
[hyperventilating]

484
00:54:34,563 --> 00:54:36,190
What is your mother's name?

485
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:46,784
I can't-
I can't remember.

486
00:54:46,819 --> 00:54:49,454
DR. KAHN: Calm-calm down.

487
00:54:49,489 --> 00:54:52,755
Breathe. Breathe.

488
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:57,296
Memory loss is a natural reaction
in some cases,

489
00:54:57,331 --> 00:54:58,386
so breathe.

490
00:54:59,338 --> 00:55:01,346
That's it now.

491
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:05,887
Sometimes it's a product of something
as simple as stress, okay?

492
00:55:09,932 --> 00:55:12,526
You guys blame everything
