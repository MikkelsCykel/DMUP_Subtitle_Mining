1
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:02,154
- Oh, no.

2
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:31,545
- Hi, Mom.
- Hello, Madeline. What are you doing?

3
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:34,382
Uh, homework.

4
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:36,251
Over spring break?

5
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:38,085
You're not climbing,
are you?

6
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:41,389
- 'Cause you know I don't want you to be climbing.
- No, Mom.

7
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:43,019
I'm not climbing.

8
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:45,030
Mrs. Phillips,
they've been waiting for you.

9
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:47,032
I'm sorry.
Just one second.

10
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,762
Sweetie, I'm gonna be late,
so I'm gonna need you to...

11
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,929
Pick up Max from day care.
Surprise.

12
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,906
Yeah. It's not gonna be
forever, sweetheart.

13
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:56,908
It's just until I finish
this project.

14
00:02:56,976 --> 00:02:59,467
- All right. I'll be right down.
- Down?

15
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:02,310
Over.
You know what I mean.

16
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:05,374
Okay. I'll see you a little later.
I love you.

17
00:03:11,157 --> 00:03:14,422
Good afternoon, Mrs. Phillips.
Nice of you tojoin us.

18
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:19,431
Are you aware that your security company's
deadline for getting my bank online...

19
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:21,490
was 23 hours ago?

20
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:24,665
Uh, Mr. Brisbane...

21
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:27,672
I did inform you that,
due to the age of the building...

22
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,641
The primary shareholders will be here
for the opening of the bank...

23
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,644
next Friday night.

24
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:37,012
As I have said, the system will not have been
tested, and I cannot, in good conscience...

25
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:40,610
That party will take place, Mrs. Phillips,
with or without your consent.

26
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:43,087
This is one of the most
complex installs...

27
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:46,057
Hartmann, don't tell me
how to run my bank. All right?

28
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:48,320
You work for me. Remember?

29
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:51,124
Now, when I turn around...

30
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:53,188
both of you will be gone.

31
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:09,014
And the race is underway.!

32
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:22,124
Lap masters, secure the roadway.

33
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:25,187
Number 16...

34
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:38,299
Number 11, Bad Chad, is into the pits...

35
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:43,006
as we go into
turn number one.

36
00:04:56,929 --> 00:04:58,863
Hey, retard,
I'm losing the race...

37
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:01,263
'cause you don't know
what you're doing!

38
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:05,160
I can't believe Mom made me
hire you as my lead mechanic.

39
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:08,173
- Damn.!
- Done!

40
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:16,241
You'd better pray this works.

41
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:28,554
Number 11, Bad Chad,
is finally out of the pits.

42
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:36,201
Come on, man.
Come on. Come on.

43
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:40,103
Chris the Clutch pulling
tight, giving Bad Chad reason to worry.

44
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:47,540
Looks like that front end may have gone out.!

45
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:50,309
Number 11, Bad Chad,
is out of the race.

46
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:52,044
Good job, dorkus!

47
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:54,643
Dumb, stupid...

48
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:56,655
Gus!

49
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:58,748
He's got his own problems.

50
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:01,760
His crews are out there cleaning up.
We got ourselves a yellow flag.

51
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:20,171
There she is.
My leading lady, my star.

52
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:24,376
Sound, speed and...
action!

53
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:46,328
Maddy!

54
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:52,103
Maddy.!

55
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:57,140
Whoa!

56
00:06:57,216 --> 00:06:59,150
Hey! Fart knocker!

57
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:01,152
I'm gonna kill you!

58
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:06,114
Stop it!

59
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:10,361
Cut it out!
Cut it out! Aah!

60
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,694
Not so tight!
Let go!

61
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:16,366
- Hi.
- Oh, come on!

62
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,701
- Why don't you pick on someone your own size?
- Ah, climber girl.

63
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:25,234
Go contaminate someone else.

64
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:27,506
Oh, look.!
Here come Captain Cool.!

65
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,912
Loser number three.

66
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:33,418
Look, I'm having a barbecue at my house,
if you guys wanna come over.

67
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:35,420
- Definitely.
- Definitely.

68
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:37,547
Hey, I don't know
if you heard...

69
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:40,387
but Bad Chad picked up a shift
at your mama's bank.

70
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,054
I'll be working with Lieutenant Ferrell
in security.

71
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:46,030
One step closer
to being a cop.

72
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:51,263
Don't worry. Ferrell won't let Bad Chad
carry a weapon. He's an intern!

73
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:53,862
Trainee, butt munch!

74
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:57,740
Sorry. He's training to be a butt munch.
Doing a good job, too!

75
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,677
- I'm gonna brain you.! Get over here.!
- I'm gonna tell Mom.!

76
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:02,680
You are so dead.!

77
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:05,683
- When I catch you, I'm gonna give you a purple nurple...
- So immature!

78
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:07,719
Isn't he?

79
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,586
Okay, folks,
race number three will start in five minutes.

80
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,591
So let's get ready to...

81
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:16,560
step on the gas
and let's kick some... butt!

82
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:18,563
It's race time!

83
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,435
"Butt"?

84
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,437
"Butt" what?

85
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,439
- Hi, Dad.
- Hey, kiddo. What's up?

86
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,442
Mom needs me to pick up Max
from day care again.

87
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,944
It won't be forever, sweetie.

88
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,946
All right,
now you sound like Mom.

89
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:37,005
That's so terrible?

90
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,711
You okay?

91
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:47,392
Is this a new style
that the kids are sporting?

92
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:52,063
- Dad, don't freak out.
- When do I ever freak out, Madeline?

93
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:56,397
- It's just that there are
a thousand other sports...

94
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:59,768
That don't involve falling
a hundred feet to your death.

95
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,740
Dad, you said standing on top of
Mount Everest was the best day of your life.

96
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:06,005
No, I said it was
one of the best days of my life.

97
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:07,773
Look.

98
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:09,940
See, I even wore
the hat you gave me.

99
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:16,251
I just don't understand what the problem is
with me trying to be like you.

100
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:18,950
Do we have to discuss this every day?

101
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:21,858
Just till I turn 18.

102
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,335
Okay, race fans,
here we are.

103
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,337
The last race of the day!

104
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,963
Drivers,
get in position.

105
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,601
- Hey, Mr. P, can I ask you
a very serious question?

106
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:40,612
Only if you want
a very serious answer.

107
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:44,013
Do ladies like guys who build stuff
with their hands?

108
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:47,849
Or do they go for the nerds who
play computer games and stuff?

109
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,286
Yo, what he means is...

110
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:52,483
do women prefer
a low-I.Q.? Ber-male...

111
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:55,891
who only knows stuff
about spark plugs...

112
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:58,157
or do they prefer
a true artist...

113
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:01,563
who has both sensitivity
and a brain?

114
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:03,898
That's a very difficult
question, boys...

115
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:06,063
but I'm afraid
I'm not the one to ask.

116
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:09,403
- Hey, Madeline Rose...
- No, no, no, no, no!

117
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:11,340
Dad, don't call me that.

118
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:14,846
What are you doing?

119
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:17,883
- Nothing.
- Nothing. Nothing.

120
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,578
- Ow, ow, ow! Ow!

121
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:23,554
Aah! Aah!
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

122
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,921
It's an old
climber's trick.

123
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:31,328
Dude, you're gonna have a scar.
Why do you get all the cool stuff?

124
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:35,663
It's true. Women love scars.
This drives Maddy's mom crazy. Check it out.

125
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:37,600
- Whoa!
- That's gross!

126
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:40,104
- You can touch it if you want.
- Is that from when you fell?

127
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:42,231
Yep. Hundred-foot free-fall.

128
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:45,402
Okay, okay. Okay.
Stop touching.

129
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,241
Bad touch. Okay.

130
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:58,156
Hey, stranger.

131
00:10:58,224 --> 00:11:00,283
Not you too.

132
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:03,726
- Now, this... is a nutritious dinner.
- Please.

133
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:05,787
Don't give me
a hard time.

134
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:09,367
We just miss you.

135
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:11,232
Especially Maddy.

136
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:17,375
And I don't wanna have to set my alarm
for the middle of the night...

137
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:20,276
just so I can have
a date with my wife.

138
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:25,476
- Would you like to go dancing?

139
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:37,522
- I have to go back to work. I can't... I really...
- You have to do this first, okay?

140
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,636
Tom, come on. Quit messing around.
I can't hold you up.

141
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,638
I can't...

142
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,140
Tom?
What's going on?

143
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,142
I can't feel my legs.

144
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,144
What...
Where does it hurt?

145
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:56,477
Tom?
Can you hear me?

146
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:59,382
Tom? Tom.!

147
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:07,083
The injury probably occurred
during his climbing accident.

148
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:09,093
There must be something
you can do.

149
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:12,824
I mean, isn't there any kind
of emergency surgery or anything?

150
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:15,332
There's nothing
we can do here.

151
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:19,269
There is a private medical facility in Denmark
that has done testing on this injury.

152
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:21,169
Okay, then let's go, then.

153
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,834
It's considered experimental.

154
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:26,173
- Even though it's been highly successful...
- We'll try anything.

155
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:29,180
Your insurance
won't cover it.

156
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:32,149
- How much?
- What?

157
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:35,483
How much does the surgery cost?
We'll pay for it.

158
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:38,114
Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.

159
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:43,286
Okay, w-we'll pay it.
Mom, tell...

160
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:45,796
Mom, tell her
we'll pay it.

161
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:49,665
Mom, we... we can...
we can pay it.

162
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:53,398
Mom, tell her we'll pay it. Please.

163
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:58,832
- Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars?
- Please tell her we'll pay it.

164
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:01,379
What happens if your dad
doesn't get the operation?

165
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:10,421
We'll go door to door.

166
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:13,424
Everyone loves your dad.
They'll give us money.

167
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:15,426
I could sell
my camera.

168
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:18,088
It's $250,000,you guys.

169
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:20,223
You know how much money
that is?

170
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,494
I have a coin collection.

171
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:24,229
They're rare.

172
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:33,945
R...

173
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:36,413
Well, what if I...
what if I borrow half?

174
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:39,178
And then I can make...

175
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:41,242
No, it doesn't exceed that.

176
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:46,056
Personal collateral?

177
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:49,492
Uh, we own a go-cart track.

178
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:56,134
Let's cut to the chase,
shall we, Mrs. Phillips?

179
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:59,399
You're not qualified
for a personal loan of this size.

180
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:04,465
I understand, but, uh,
my husband is sick and I was hoping...

181
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:07,478
Yes. Yes, I'm aware
of that, Mrs. Phillips.

182
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:11,614
Doesn't it mean anything
that I work for the bank?

183
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:15,051
- But you're freelance, aren't you?
- Mm-hmm.

184
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:17,879
From a security company.

185
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:23,828
A security company which,
under your guidance...

186
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:26,831
has been unable
to provide my bank...

187
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:30,335
with a fully operational security system
in the allotted time...

188
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:32,893
stated in the contract.

189
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,808
Come on.

190
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,867
Come on, sweetie.

191
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:47,682
Don't you have a heart?

192
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:51,416
This is not an emotional issue,
Mrs. Phillips.

193
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:55,455
A bank has no heart.

194
00:14:56,795 --> 00:14:59,491
Only paper in a vault.

195
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:07,461
Strange not being able to move.

196
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:13,902
I've been staring at the same spot
on the ceiling for the past three hours.

197
00:15:13,978 --> 00:15:16,037
Mom can't come up
with the money, Dad.

198
00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:20,641
I escaped death
on that climb, Maddy.

199
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,721
Twenty feet from the summit,
my gear stuck...

200
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:28,725
but there was this perfect crack
all the way up to the top.

201
00:15:28,793 --> 00:15:31,227
You free-climbed it?

202
00:15:31,296 --> 00:15:35,232
It was so easy,
I lost concentration and I fell.

203
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:39,168
But somebody or something was looking out
for me so I could go home...

204
00:15:39,237 --> 00:15:43,230
see you, get to know
what a great girl you are.

205
00:15:45,076 --> 00:15:49,069
In a way, that fall was the best thing
that could've happened to me.

206
00:15:50,882 --> 00:15:53,817
You know
I'd do anything for you.

207
00:15:53,885 --> 00:15:56,820
Dad, we'll come up with the money.
I promise.

208
00:15:56,955 --> 00:16:00,356
And lined it
with a 200- foot-high steel chamber...

209
00:16:00,425 --> 00:16:02,359
which houses
the Lion Safe.

210
00:16:02,427 --> 00:16:05,089
The system combines
the best of new technology...

211
00:16:05,163 --> 00:16:07,427
and old tried-and-true
security methods...

212
00:16:07,498 --> 00:16:12,060
making Harderbach Financial
the most secure a bank can be.

213
00:16:12,136 --> 00:16:15,037
The entire system is run
on a tri-motor generator...

214
00:16:15,106 --> 00:16:17,040
making power loss
a virtual impossibility...

215
00:16:17,108 --> 00:16:21,477
meaning the system will remain safe
even in the event of a citywide blackout.

216
00:16:21,546 --> 00:16:24,481
The project began
in the fall of 2000...

217
00:16:24,549 --> 00:16:27,279
and is the largest, most technologically
advanced security install to date...

218
00:16:27,352 --> 00:16:29,081
for any bank
in North America.

219
00:16:29,153 --> 00:16:32,088
The halls are lined with hundreds
of motion-sensitive cameras...

220
00:16:32,156 --> 00:16:34,681
whose images are fed back
to a state-of- the- art security booth.

221
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:37,694
Until the system
has been fully tested...

222
00:16:37,762 --> 00:16:41,129
the halls will be patrolled after hours
by highly trained attack dogs.

223
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,429
This all leads
to the Lion Safe.

224
00:16:43,501 --> 00:16:46,402
The safe is suspended nearly
100 feet off the ground...

225
00:16:46,471 --> 00:16:50,407
and is equipped to hold over $25 million
in cash and gold bullion.

226
00:16:50,475 --> 00:16:52,966
Safety deposit boxes
line the walls of this chamber.

227
00:16:53,044 --> 00:16:56,275
- Slated to be finished in April of 2004...
- Are you crazy?

228
00:16:56,347 --> 00:16:58,247
We can't rob a bank.

229
00:16:58,316 --> 00:17:00,580
We'll pay them back.

230
00:17:00,651 --> 00:17:02,915
- How?
- I don't know. I'll work.

231
00:17:02,987 --> 00:17:04,921
I'll do anything.

232
00:17:04,989 --> 00:17:08,117
You understand what happens
if we get caught, right? We go to jail forever.

233
00:17:08,192 --> 00:17:10,660
Like, until we're 21.

234
00:17:10,728 --> 00:17:13,196
No one will ever suspect us.

235
00:17:13,264 --> 00:17:16,256
Adults treat us like we're five years old anyway.
How hard could it be?

236
00:17:16,334 --> 00:17:20,634
Tomorrow I'll go to work with my mom
and check out the bank.

237
00:17:20,705 --> 00:17:24,163
Meanwhile, Gus, you need to find out
who the architect is of the bank...

238
00:17:24,242 --> 00:17:26,733
and see if you can get
a floor plan or a model.

239
00:17:26,811 --> 00:17:30,474
And Austin...
Austin'll take care of the dogs.

240
00:17:30,548 --> 00:17:34,075
- What dogs?
- The Rottweilers.

241
00:17:34,152 --> 00:17:35,710
Vicious killing dogs.

242
00:17:35,787 --> 00:17:38,722
Gus, come on.
This is serious.

243
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:42,590
Tomorrow, at the bank, I'll try to check out
my mom's security system.

244
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:46,152
- Good morning. Who's in the car with you today?
- My daughter.

245
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:48,357
I'll take as many pictures as I can.

246
00:17:50,001 --> 00:17:52,492
You guys,
I really need you.

247
00:17:54,272 --> 00:17:57,241
All right. For Mr. P.

248
00:17:57,308 --> 00:17:59,299
For your dad.

249
00:18:02,814 --> 00:18:05,806
Okay, Maddy, here we go.

250
00:18:09,387 --> 00:18:11,480
Maddy?

251
00:18:44,255 --> 00:18:47,315
Do you have any idea how fast
you were goin'? Save it, pal.

252
00:18:47,391 --> 00:18:50,155
License and registration.

253
00:18:55,299 --> 00:18:58,826
That... is the eye
of God, Chad.

254
00:18:58,903 --> 00:19:02,737
Do you see these people?
These are not people.

255
00:19:02,807 --> 00:19:06,903
These are snakes in paradise,
waiting for your weakest moment...

256
00:19:06,978 --> 00:19:09,970
any chance you give them.

257
00:19:10,047 --> 00:19:12,880
These people?
Not to be trusted.

258
00:19:15,453 --> 00:19:17,944
Oh.! My sweethearts.

259
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:23,490
Maddy, I love that you wanted to come
to work with me today, sweetheart...

260
00:19:23,561 --> 00:19:26,496
but I have a lot of work to do,
so I need you to keep up.

261
00:19:26,564 --> 00:19:29,055
- Can I see the safe?
- That's just the old safe.

262
00:19:29,133 --> 00:19:31,226
- The real one's upstairs.
- What are those?

263
00:19:32,937 --> 00:19:35,303
- That's a motion detector.
- Can I see the new safe?

264
00:19:35,373 --> 00:19:39,207
And if Miss Fancy-pants Phillips
would have listened to me...

265
00:19:39,277 --> 00:19:43,008
we wouldn't need all this
high-tech flim-flammery.

266
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,139
The dogs...

267
00:19:47,318 --> 00:19:50,253
The dogs would have done
all the work.

268
00:19:50,321 --> 00:19:53,654
The dogs and my black belt,
that is.

269
00:19:59,297 --> 00:20:01,731
- Aaah!

270
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:03,824
Back to the monitor,
maggot!

271
00:20:03,901 --> 00:20:05,766
Your office is upstairs?

272
00:20:05,836 --> 00:20:09,237
Yeah. I need to be
near the safe.

273
00:20:09,307 --> 00:20:12,276
Whoa. That thing
looks like it's alive.

274
00:20:12,343 --> 00:20:14,607
It's got a built-in
motion detector...

275
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:18,171
The guards can't watch all 100 cameras
at the same time...

276
00:20:18,249 --> 00:20:20,979
so when the camera picks up movement,
the light goes on and they can see us.

277
00:20:21,052 --> 00:20:23,145
Watch.
Just stay completely still.

278
00:20:25,856 --> 00:20:27,483
Ah. Climber girl.

279
00:20:33,731 --> 00:20:36,461
- That's pretty cool.

280
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:46,107
They'd better fix the I.S.P., because
that whole side of the building is S.O.L.

281
00:20:46,177 --> 00:20:48,111
- Molly?
- Oh.

282
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:50,613
I didn't think you were
coming in today.

283
00:20:50,681 --> 00:20:54,947
The party is Friday, so I wanted to make sure
the system is as close as possible.

284
00:20:55,019 --> 00:20:59,979
Yeah. Listen, I spoke with Brisbane
about the loan, and he just wouldn't budge.

285
00:21:00,057 --> 00:21:03,993
- I'm really sorry.
- Oh, God. We'll have to figure out some other way.

286
00:21:04,061 --> 00:21:07,224
- Would you like a tour?
- Oh, Alan, that's really...

287
00:21:07,298 --> 00:21:09,926
- Yeah! That'd be awesome.
- Well, great.

288
00:21:10,001 --> 00:21:12,936
We'll start this way.
Don't worry. I'll take good care of her.

289
00:21:13,004 --> 00:21:14,995
Now, we're gonna begin...

290
00:21:20,911 --> 00:21:25,143
I paid that phone bill.!
I paid that phone bill last week.!

291
00:21:27,618 --> 00:21:30,314
Hi. My name's Austin...

292
00:21:30,388 --> 00:21:32,379
Easy.

293
00:21:32,456 --> 00:21:35,152
My name's Austin,
and, uh, I make movies. Director.

294
00:21:36,527 --> 00:21:39,928
Really?
How may I help you?

295
00:21:39,997 --> 00:21:43,797
I got this dog for my birthday, and I was
hoping I could use him as a stunt dog...

296
00:21:43,868 --> 00:21:45,859
What kind of dog
do you have?

297
00:21:45,936 --> 00:21:49,531
- A Budweiser?
- Rottweiler?

298
00:21:49,607 --> 00:21:53,236
- Yeah.
- I just happen to be a Rottweiler expert.

299
00:21:53,311 --> 00:21:55,745
There is a really nice
boy here...

300
00:21:55,813 --> 00:21:59,078
who's going to write an essay
about the design of the...

301
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:01,948
Harderbach Financial building...

302
00:22:02,019 --> 00:22:05,716
and he needs a floor plan drawing
that he can use...

303
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:07,724
as a visual aid
for his essay.

304
00:22:07,792 --> 00:22:09,555
Are you freakin' nuts?

305
00:22:09,627 --> 00:22:14,291
You can't give bank floor plans to a kid!
You're just...

306
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,927
Normally he's very nice.

307
00:22:18,002 --> 00:22:21,267
But it's a little more difficult
with banks.

308
00:22:21,339 --> 00:22:24,706
I mean, imagine if you were a bank robber...

309
00:22:26,377 --> 00:22:29,938
It's just that last time
I got a "C" on my essay...

310
00:22:30,014 --> 00:22:31,948
because I didn't have
any visual aids.

311
00:22:32,016 --> 00:22:35,884
And my stepdad, he...
Well, he gets a little...

312
00:22:37,121 --> 00:22:39,112
Oh!

313
00:22:43,627 --> 00:22:45,993
Just stay here.

314
00:22:57,942 --> 00:23:01,503
You can't see it now, but by the party
we are hoping it's primo.

315
00:23:01,579 --> 00:23:04,514
Down here is the security room...
ultra high- tech and cool.

316
00:23:04,582 --> 00:23:06,982
- Your mom designed that too.

317
00:23:07,051 --> 00:23:11,579
Notice the key pads, which are designed to keep
people out of the important areas of the bank.

318
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:16,016
Who has the codes
to all these?

319
00:23:16,093 --> 00:23:18,823
Oh, they're different
from room to room.

320
00:23:18,896 --> 00:23:22,332
- But I have a code that is good for the whole building.
- Cool.

321
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,698
Come on.

322
00:23:29,874 --> 00:23:33,503
"D-E-N-I-R-O."

323
00:23:33,577 --> 00:23:35,738
- De Niro.

324
00:23:39,517 --> 00:23:41,508
Oh, look at that view.

325
00:23:43,287 --> 00:23:45,448
This is the coolest office
in the building.

326
00:23:45,523 --> 00:23:47,889
It belongs to the big cheese,
Mr. Brisbane.

327
00:23:47,958 --> 00:23:49,789
Check this out.

328
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,691
Huh?

329
00:23:51,762 --> 00:23:53,855
Huh?
And get this.

330
00:23:53,931 --> 00:23:58,891
Your mom has rigged it so you can control
all the cameras from right here.

331
00:24:01,806 --> 00:24:04,206
You talkin' to me? Huh?

332
00:24:04,275 --> 00:24:07,472
Are you talkin' to me?

333
00:24:08,546 --> 00:24:10,173
It's De Niro.

334
00:24:10,247 --> 00:24:14,240
I still do some acting.
This bank manager thing is just temporary.

335
00:24:14,318 --> 00:24:16,047
Come on. You try it.

336
00:24:18,489 --> 00:24:20,423
I don't know
what to say.

337
00:24:20,491 --> 00:24:22,482
Say anything.

338
00:24:23,594 --> 00:24:25,528
- Hi.
- Disgusting.

339
00:24:25,596 --> 00:24:27,393
Good!

340
00:24:33,337 --> 00:24:35,328
Haah.!

341
00:24:36,841 --> 00:24:38,775
Ooh.

342
00:24:38,843 --> 00:24:41,710
In this room there's a tunnel
that leads to the safe.

343
00:24:41,779 --> 00:24:44,577
I can only tell you
a little bit about the safe.

344
00:24:44,648 --> 00:24:47,583
Only your mom understands the whole thing.
After all, she designed it.

345
00:24:47,651 --> 00:24:51,087
- Oh! No! My God!

346
00:24:53,157 --> 00:24:56,422
I can't wait until we get rid of these things.
They get me every time.

347
00:24:56,494 --> 00:24:59,156
Down.! Shh.!

348
00:25:01,265 --> 00:25:04,428
Rottweilers respond
to German commands only!

349
00:25:07,104 --> 00:25:09,368
Ausfahrt, Killer.
Ausfahrt.!

350
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,433
Say "Ausfahrt, Killer."
Do it, or he'll rip your throat out!

351
00:25:13,511 --> 00:25:15,979
- Ass fart!
- Ausfahrt.!

352
00:25:16,881 --> 00:25:19,213
You must show them respect.!

353
00:25:20,951 --> 00:25:23,146
- Ouch fart!

354
00:25:24,455 --> 00:25:26,821
Wrong answer.

355
00:25:28,459 --> 00:25:32,555
- Ass fart! Ass fart!

356
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:34,825
- No.! Go away.! Ass fart.!

357
00:25:52,383 --> 00:25:55,477
Get outta here, kid,
before I turn him loose on you!

358
00:25:55,553 --> 00:25:58,113
No respect.!

359
00:25:58,188 --> 00:26:01,248
- Come on!

360
00:26:25,683 --> 00:26:28,117
Don't ever tell anybody
where you got it.

361
00:26:28,185 --> 00:26:29,982
I would never.
Thank you.

362
00:26:52,276 --> 00:26:55,211
They're gonna send out a search party for me
if I don't get back to work.

363
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:58,544
- Can you find your way back to your mom's office?
- Yeah. Thanks, Mr. Hartmann.

364
00:26:58,616 --> 00:27:01,483
- Okay. Bye.
- We'll see you tomorrow.

365
00:27:01,552 --> 00:27:03,816
- Mr. Hartmann?
- Hmm?

366
00:27:03,887 --> 00:27:06,981
I think you'd make
a really good actor.

367
00:27:07,057 --> 00:27:09,048
Thanks.

368
00:27:14,131 --> 00:27:17,225
The party's in two days.
That's when we'll hit the bank.

369
00:27:17,301 --> 00:27:20,998
- Austin, how'd it go with the dogs?
- The dogs are under control.

370
00:27:21,071 --> 00:27:23,005
Gus, the model looks pretty cool.

371
00:27:23,073 --> 00:27:27,407
Piece of cake.
I thought that secretary was gonna adopt me.

372
00:27:36,587 --> 00:27:40,614
Do you guys think we can do it?
Do you really think we can get the money?

373
00:27:40,691 --> 00:27:44,024
- Are you kidding? Of course.
- Yeah. Of course.

374
00:27:44,094 --> 00:27:47,188
I mean, you're, like, the best climber
in the whole state.

375
00:27:47,264 --> 00:27:51,928
Yeah, and Austin's, like,
some freak of nature computer genius.

376
00:27:52,002 --> 00:27:54,937
- Yeah, and Gus is...

377
00:27:58,275 --> 00:28:00,140
Gus is disgusting.

378
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:03,668
Austin, this should be
exactly the height of the gate at the bank.

379
00:28:03,747 --> 00:28:05,738
Watch carefully, okay?

380
00:28:11,255 --> 00:28:13,246
Okay, Austin, your turn.

381
00:28:17,528 --> 00:28:19,894
The cart
doesn't control you.

382
00:28:19,963 --> 00:28:22,124
You control the cart.

383
00:28:22,199 --> 00:28:24,258
- Go.
- I got it!

384
00:28:27,171 --> 00:28:29,969
Whoa... Hey!
Whoa! Whoa!

385
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,974
Yikes!

386
00:28:32,042 --> 00:28:34,670
No! Aaah!

387
00:28:36,046 --> 00:28:39,812
Is there any way you can make him
quieter and faster?

388
00:28:45,656 --> 00:28:49,456
Do you want a window
or an aisle?

389
00:29:01,905 --> 00:29:04,499
A hundred P.S.I.
Of pure NOS.

390
00:29:23,627 --> 00:29:26,858
Okay, work for your daddy.

391
00:29:34,271 --> 00:29:36,865
It worked!
I'm a genius!

392
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:40,569
But how am I gonna stop?
Maybe I'm not a genius!

393
00:29:40,644 --> 00:29:43,340
Aaaaah!

394
00:29:56,293 --> 00:29:59,194
Mr. Hartmann's a really nice guy.

395
00:29:59,263 --> 00:30:02,198
- Do you have your script?
- I'm the director. I'm always prepared.

396
00:30:02,266 --> 00:30:04,200
"I'm always prepared."

397
00:30:04,268 --> 00:30:07,704
Austin, you just have to get him
to say to turn the alarm...

398
00:30:07,771 --> 00:30:09,932
Off. I know, I know.

399
00:30:11,008 --> 00:30:13,067
- Come on. Hurry up.
- I'm coming.

400
00:30:13,143 --> 00:30:15,146
Wait for me!

401
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:19,511
Take it easy. Take it easy.!
Take it easy.

402
00:30:19,583 --> 00:30:21,949
All right, here.

403
00:30:22,019 --> 00:30:24,544
Maddy's playing the girl
who's home alone and scared of the dark.

404
00:30:24,622 --> 00:30:28,114
You play her dad,
who walks in just as the alarm blares.

405
00:30:28,192 --> 00:30:31,684
Wh-Wh-What do I do
for a living?

406
00:30:33,297 --> 00:30:35,231
I'm glad you asked.

407
00:30:35,299 --> 00:30:38,359
You work for a specialized branch
of the C.I.A.

408
00:30:38,435 --> 00:30:42,098
Ohh, I like that.
I've always wanted to play an assassin.

409
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:43,970
Well,
here's your chance.

410
00:30:44,041 --> 00:30:46,566
You are a C.I.A. Assassin.

411
00:30:46,644 --> 00:30:50,410
Um, can I get a water, please?

412
00:30:50,481 --> 00:30:53,075
Can I talk to you
for a second? Over here.

413
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:56,142
Um, okay.

414
00:30:57,388 --> 00:30:59,322
Which is stronger...

415
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:01,984
hair... or no hair?

416
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:09,826
- L... I think hair.
- Okay.

417
00:31:11,335 --> 00:31:14,304
- Six slick Schick super shavers.
- And we're ready.

418
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:21,910
Okay, this is scene one,
take one.

419
00:31:21,979 --> 00:31:24,971
Sound, speed and...

420
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:26,778
action.

421
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:31,344
- Dad, is that you?
- Hey, take it easy. It's only me.

422
00:31:32,356 --> 00:31:36,292
You were really good today, Austin.
Seriously. Really good.

423
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:39,955
I just try to stay out of the way of my actors
and let the magic happen.

424
00:31:48,939 --> 00:31:51,999
Gus, what are you doing?
We have to go over the plan.

425
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:54,010
Go over the plan
with your boyfriend.

426
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:56,945
What are you talking about?
He's not my boyfriend.

427
00:31:57,014 --> 00:32:00,575
- Oh, so you'd rather go out with Gus.
- I never said that...

428
00:32:00,651 --> 00:32:04,883
Are all boys this stupid?
I don't wanna go out with either of you!

429
00:32:04,955 --> 00:32:08,652
If we're so stupid, then why don't you
just rob the bank yourself?

430
00:32:08,726 --> 00:32:11,695
- Fine! I will!
- Good luck rigging your go-cart.

431
00:32:11,762 --> 00:32:15,391
Yeah, and have a good time hacking
into the bank's computer by yourself.

432
00:32:15,466 --> 00:32:18,026
This whole bank idea
sucks!

433
00:32:33,984 --> 00:32:36,418
Dad, I have to
talk to you.

434
00:32:36,487 --> 00:32:39,183
I'm gonna steal $250,000
from Mom's bank.

435
00:32:39,256 --> 00:32:42,692
I have to climb a hundred feet
to get to the safe.

436
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:46,696
Way higher than I've ever,
ever climbed before.

437
00:32:46,764 --> 00:32:50,757
And I have to lie to my two best friends
to get 'em to do it with me.

438
00:32:58,375 --> 00:33:00,900
Well, Maddy...

439
00:33:00,978 --> 00:33:03,412
a hundred feet
is too dangerous.

440
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:06,176
You know,
that's how far I fell.

441
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:08,548
Yeah, I know, Dad.

442
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:10,553
Plus, it's illegal
to steal money.

443
00:33:10,621 --> 00:33:14,022
You know Mom'll get fired
if anyone ever found out.

444
00:33:15,292 --> 00:33:17,283
I thought about
all that, but...

445
00:33:19,797 --> 00:33:23,289
but wouldn't it be worth it if
it means you could get better?

446
00:33:27,271 --> 00:33:28,898
Yeah, Maddy...

447
00:33:28,972 --> 00:33:30,963
it probably would be.

448
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,477
I've been thinking
since yesterday, and...

449
00:33:43,854 --> 00:33:45,981
I love you.

450
00:33:49,693 --> 00:33:52,423
Here. Um,
I have the other half.

451
00:33:57,735 --> 00:34:00,260
- Please say all that again.
- Stop. Come on.

452
00:34:03,674 --> 00:34:05,608
Promise to help
with the mission?

453
00:34:06,643 --> 00:34:08,235
Yeah.

454
00:34:08,312 --> 00:34:12,339
Just don't tell Gus, 'cause we need him,
and he wouldn't do it if he knew.

455
00:34:12,416 --> 00:34:14,509
He'd be devastated.

456
00:34:14,585 --> 00:34:17,520
- What about Austin?
- You're much cuter.

457
00:34:17,588 --> 00:34:20,284
I've actually liked you
the whole time.

458
00:34:21,492 --> 00:34:23,426
Yes! I knew it!

459
00:34:25,863 --> 00:34:27,797
Uh, here.

460
00:34:27,865 --> 00:34:29,833
I have the other half.

461
00:34:31,068 --> 00:34:33,832
Promise to help
with the mission?

462
00:34:40,844 --> 00:34:44,280
- Okay.
- Cool.

463
00:34:44,348 --> 00:34:47,374
Okay, guys,
let's go over the plan one last time.

464
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:54,714
So, I took Maddy's pictures from the bank,
the model that Gus brought home...

465
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:57,022
and I scanned them
into the computer.

466
00:34:57,094 --> 00:35:00,359
Using those elements,
I created a digital blueprint of the building.

467
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:02,365
Check it out.

468
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,367
Voil?

469
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:06,300
Whoa!
That is awesome!

470
00:35:09,406 --> 00:35:12,170
I mean, it's okay...

471
00:35:12,242 --> 00:35:14,233
if you like
that kind of stuff.

472
00:35:14,311 --> 00:35:16,711
Wow.

473
00:35:18,949 --> 00:35:20,974
Here's where
the party's gonna be.

474
00:35:21,051 --> 00:35:23,952
It'll be mostly contained
in the lobby of the bank.

475
00:35:24,021 --> 00:35:26,922
It's gonna be pretty fancy,
so we're gonna need to blend in.

476
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:29,857
Security's on the second floor, so we'll
have to get past your brother and Ferrell...

477
00:35:29,927 --> 00:35:32,862
to get to the elevator that accesses
the ninth floor where the safe is.

478
00:35:37,501 --> 00:35:41,904
Okay, and Austin, you'll hack into the bank's
camera system from Brisbane's office.

479
00:35:46,243 --> 00:35:48,609
Gus, were gonna
make our way to the safe.

480
00:35:54,751 --> 00:35:57,219
It's suspended a hundred feet
off the ground...

481
00:35:57,287 --> 00:36:00,552
so the only way to get to it
is to climb.

482
00:36:00,624 --> 00:36:02,558
Wow.

483
00:36:02,626 --> 00:36:07,256
Maddy, are you sure you're gonna be able
to make this climb?

484
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:11,028
I mean, it's double the size
of the water tower.

485
00:36:11,101 --> 00:36:15,435
You guys take care of your jobs.
I'll take care of mine.

486
00:36:17,641 --> 00:36:21,133
They're gonna be doing a lot of tests
on your father tonight at the hospital...

487
00:36:21,211 --> 00:36:22,610
so I wanna be there for that.

488
00:36:22,679 --> 00:36:25,614
I'm gonna need you to look after Max
while I'm gone.

489
00:36:25,682 --> 00:36:28,879
Mom, I can't. I'm going out
with Gus and Austin.

490
00:36:28,952 --> 00:36:32,046
- You never think about me.
- If you're not gonna come to the hospital, then you're...

491
00:36:32,122 --> 00:36:34,215
- Mom, I can't, I...
- Maddy.

492
00:36:35,292 --> 00:36:37,487
You're gonna babysit
Max tonight. Okay?

493
00:36:37,561 --> 00:36:39,552
That's it.

494
00:36:42,399 --> 00:36:44,333
Oh, one more thing.

495
00:36:44,401 --> 00:36:46,801
I do think about you,
Madeline.

496
00:36:47,871 --> 00:36:50,806
Every day.
All the time.

497
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:08,354
Nice bandana.

498
00:37:09,426 --> 00:37:11,417
Nice turtleneck.

499
00:37:14,731 --> 00:37:18,497
- What's he doing here?
- I have to babysit him.

500
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:22,699
But he's gonna completely ruin
everything we just worked for.

501
00:37:22,773 --> 00:37:25,833
He hasn't made a sound his whole life.
I don't think he's gonna start now.

502
00:37:25,909 --> 00:37:27,467
What if we mess up?

503
00:37:27,544 --> 00:37:30,308
We're my dad's only chance.

504
00:37:31,882 --> 00:37:33,873
I'm ready.

505
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:38,479
- You ready?
- Let's hit it.

506
00:37:57,307 --> 00:37:59,138
Ooh! Gross!

507
00:37:59,209 --> 00:38:02,076
Mom, Bart was taking
a picture of his butt!

508
00:38:02,145 --> 00:38:06,377
- Like I'm really gonna take a picture of my butt.
- Stop it, you two.

509
00:38:08,385 --> 00:38:10,717
Since it's just the four of us
tonight, we're having dinner...

510
00:38:10,787 --> 00:38:13,153
- at the Rusty Barnacle.
- Yay!

511
00:38:22,899 --> 00:38:26,528
Grab a burger and...
Only four of us? Who escaped?

512
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:23,025
You know, that part?
I was really, really proud of it.

513
00:39:23,093 --> 00:39:26,028
Aren't those marvelous?
Please let me show you.

514
00:39:26,096 --> 00:39:29,088
These are really quite extraordinary.
The lighting, in particular...

515
00:39:31,968 --> 00:39:33,902
Well, you know...

516
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:35,961
The, uh, uh...

517
00:39:47,651 --> 00:39:49,642
It's all clear.

518
00:39:51,321 --> 00:39:53,312
Here you go,
Maddy.

519
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:58,794
Okay, when I get up there...

520
00:39:58,862 --> 00:40:01,797
I'll try to disable the motion sensors
so you guys can just come up the stairs.

521
00:40:01,865 --> 00:40:03,492
Careful, Maddy.

522
00:40:11,541 --> 00:40:14,806
- Maddy! Camera!

523
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:22,842
- Careful.

524
00:40:35,065 --> 00:40:38,000
I gotta get Chad and Ferrell
out of that security booth.

525
00:40:38,068 --> 00:40:40,969
Don't worry. We got it covered.

526
00:40:41,037 --> 00:40:44,029
And strike, and strike,
like a cobra!

527
00:40:45,909 --> 00:40:48,742
Aaah.!

528
00:40:48,812 --> 00:40:51,337
- Haah! Hoo!
- Oh!

529
00:40:52,449 --> 00:40:54,417
- Lieuten...
- Ohh!

530
00:40:54,484 --> 00:40:57,419
Lesson one, Chad.

531
00:40:57,487 --> 00:41:00,820
Never take your eyes
off the enemy.

532
00:41:03,727 --> 00:41:06,457
Take this for a test drive.

533
00:41:11,968 --> 00:41:15,426
Dude, the way your feet smell,
it's just...

534
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,731
it's not normal.

535
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:22,001
Whoo!

536
00:41:23,113 --> 00:41:25,513
God, Gus!

537
00:41:27,117 --> 00:41:29,677
Oh, my God.

538
00:41:35,425 --> 00:41:37,290
- Gotcha.

539
00:41:39,162 --> 00:41:41,687
- What's that?

540
00:41:41,765 --> 00:41:44,199
Motion detected, north staircase.

541
00:41:44,267 --> 00:41:46,701
Check the monitors.
Check the monitors!

542
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:49,705
I don't see anything.

543
00:41:49,773 --> 00:41:54,437
That's when your enemy is their most
dangerous... when you can't see them.

544
00:41:56,246 --> 00:41:58,737
This is a test.
I just know it.

545
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:02,877
I'll go downstairs,
make a round.

546
00:42:02,953 --> 00:42:04,887
- You stay here...

547
00:42:04,955 --> 00:42:08,413
and take care
of your... privates.

548
00:42:10,527 --> 00:42:14,327
You stay in this booth!

549
00:42:27,043 --> 00:42:28,977
Okay, it worked.

550
00:42:29,045 --> 00:42:31,980
Well, sort of... Ferrell's gone. But now
Bad Chad's alone in the security booth.

551
00:42:32,048 --> 00:42:34,312
Just hold on. We'll think of something.

552
00:42:46,496 --> 00:42:48,430
I got it.

553
00:42:48,498 --> 00:42:50,432
I'm gonna distract him.

554
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:53,765
When I give the signal,
get into the elevator. I'll meet you there.

555
00:42:55,138 --> 00:42:57,129
Hey, Maddy,
what's the signal?

556
00:42:57,207 --> 00:42:59,732
- Maddy!

557
00:42:59,809 --> 00:43:02,175
Get away from Chad!
He's a lunatic!

558
00:43:02,245 --> 00:43:06,045
My brother's crazy. He really thinks
he's a cop. This wasn't part of the plan.

559
00:43:06,116 --> 00:43:08,107
Maddy, don't go in there.!

560
00:43:12,822 --> 00:43:14,813
Hi.

561
00:43:15,892 --> 00:43:17,655
What are you doing here?

562
00:43:19,329 --> 00:43:22,457
I was at the party.
I was totally bored.

563
00:43:22,532 --> 00:43:24,466
What are you doing?

564
00:43:24,534 --> 00:43:26,866
Just my job.

565
00:43:31,474 --> 00:43:33,465
You look different.

566
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:42,143
- Why are you such a jerk to your brother all the time?
- Well...

567
00:43:42,218 --> 00:43:44,516
You know
he completely idolizes you.

568
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:47,890
- Gus?
- Yeah.

569
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:51,758
To him, you're like
Yao Ming or Shaq.

570
00:43:51,828 --> 00:43:54,228
Well, which one?
There's a big difference.

571
00:43:54,297 --> 00:43:56,993
Yao Ming.

572
00:43:57,067 --> 00:43:58,932
- Definitely Shaq.
- You think?

573
00:43:59,002 --> 00:44:01,903
- Yeah, I think so.
- Sweet.

574
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:06,341
He thinks you're gonna be a great cop.
He told me.

575
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:15,076
Come downstairs with me. The police chief
is here to check on Mom's security system.

576
00:44:15,151 --> 00:44:19,019
You could show him how serious
you are about yourjob.

577
00:44:23,159 --> 00:44:25,889
Ferrell told me not to
leave the booth, but...

578
00:44:25,962 --> 00:44:28,954
I just came from the party.
Don't worry. He's not down there.

579
00:44:34,704 --> 00:44:36,638
She winked at me.

580
00:44:36,706 --> 00:44:39,766
- So Gus really thinks I'm cool?
- Yeah.

581
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:42,277
Maybe that's the signal.
Go.

582
00:44:42,345 --> 00:44:44,279
Where's the chief?

583
00:44:47,050 --> 00:44:51,714
That's what I love about this... the wave
it sends through the body. Unbelievable.

584
00:44:51,788 --> 00:44:53,983
Oh, God.

585
00:45:07,137 --> 00:45:09,264
Come on, Maddy.!
Come on.!

586
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:11,273
- Come on!
- Maddy, come on!

587
00:45:11,341 --> 00:45:13,275
- Hurry!
- Come on!

588
00:45:31,628 --> 00:45:34,495
All right,
go to 22.

589
00:45:40,003 --> 00:45:42,870
Freeze.! Red light.

590
00:45:51,448 --> 00:45:54,713
Go, go, go, go!

591
00:45:54,784 --> 00:45:57,480
- Red light!
- How long do we have to stay like this?

592
00:45:57,554 --> 00:45:59,545
- Go!

593
00:46:00,623 --> 00:46:02,291
- Red light!

594
00:46:06,728 --> 00:46:08,355
Green light.!

595
00:46:09,798 --> 00:46:12,392
Go, go, go, go!

596
00:46:37,225 --> 00:46:39,318
- All right, you guys.

597
00:46:40,996 --> 00:46:42,930
- I'm online.
- All right, Max.

598
00:46:42,998 --> 00:46:45,933
I'll be right back. I just gotta
go bust this bank so we can save Dad.

599
00:46:46,001 --> 00:46:47,935
Gimme five.
Yeah!

600
00:46:48,003 --> 00:46:49,732
Bye-bye.

601
00:46:52,007 --> 00:46:53,941
- Red light.

602
00:46:54,009 --> 00:46:56,102
Green light!

603
00:46:56,178 --> 00:46:58,112
- Red light.

604
00:46:58,180 --> 00:47:00,114
Go!

605
00:47:04,686 --> 00:47:06,620
Austin.

606
00:47:06,688 --> 00:47:08,918
Check.

607
00:47:08,990 --> 00:47:11,788
Do you see
any dogs in there?

608
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:16,024
I'm searching now. Nothing in the cages.
They must be somewhere else.

609
00:47:16,098 --> 00:47:18,794
It's all clear. Okay.

610
00:47:18,867 --> 00:47:22,303
- Camera panning... off.

611
00:47:36,818 --> 00:47:40,754
- No, Max! No!

612
00:47:42,991 --> 00:47:45,323
Go back, Maddy!

613
00:47:49,064 --> 00:47:50,998
Austin?

614
00:47:51,066 --> 00:47:53,261
- Max, no! Not the camera!

615
00:47:53,335 --> 00:47:55,633
This is not a toy.
No, not a toy.

616
00:47:55,704 --> 00:47:58,832
- Austin!
- Max!

617
00:47:59,841 --> 00:48:02,935
Okay, I got it. Go.

618
00:48:10,252 --> 00:48:13,847
- How do you know the dogs aren't gonna be on the other side?
- I don't.

619
00:48:13,922 --> 00:48:16,789
But I guess we find out.

620
00:48:35,210 --> 00:48:37,337
Whoa, that's high.

621
00:48:42,517 --> 00:48:44,985
Good-bye, my babies.

622
00:48:45,053 --> 00:48:49,490
- Just don't look down. You'll be fine.
- What is this?

623
00:48:49,558 --> 00:48:52,186
Another door?
How do you open this one?

624
00:48:53,261 --> 00:48:55,252
Open sesame!

625
00:48:56,765 --> 00:49:00,030
This one doesn't even
have any numbers on it.

626
00:49:01,603 --> 00:49:03,662
Whoa! Cool!

627
00:49:12,113 --> 00:49:15,048
- Mr. Ferrell... Uh, Lieutenant Ferrell?

628
00:49:15,116 --> 00:49:18,984
- Breaker, breaker! I saw something in sector five.
- I'll be right up.

629
00:49:19,054 --> 00:49:22,046
Don't get your panties in a wad.

630
00:49:48,149 --> 00:49:50,083
Whoa.

631
00:49:50,151 --> 00:49:52,142
Maddy,
we are so grounded.

632
00:49:53,822 --> 00:49:56,256
Say good-bye
to my X-Box...

633
00:49:56,324 --> 00:49:59,760
my iPod,
my go-cart.

634
00:49:59,828 --> 00:50:03,764
Gonna have to take out the trash,
do the dishes...

635
00:50:03,832 --> 00:50:06,767
massage Grandma's cold feet.

636
00:50:07,836 --> 00:50:09,770
- What?

637
00:50:09,838 --> 00:50:11,999
L-I saw something
in sector five.

638
00:50:15,343 --> 00:50:17,277
In that region.

639
00:50:17,345 --> 00:50:19,279
- Sector five, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

640
00:50:19,347 --> 00:50:21,679
I was just in
sector five!

641
00:50:23,351 --> 00:50:25,342
That was me,
you idiot!

642
00:50:29,357 --> 00:50:31,791
Did I ever tell you the story
about the boy...

643
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:34,795
who cried "sector five"
one too many times?

644
00:50:34,863 --> 00:50:36,626
Huh?

645
00:50:36,698 --> 00:50:39,132
Holy...

646
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,566
That's where they keep
all the money?

647
00:50:41,636 --> 00:50:44,230
Thanks a lot, Mom.

648
00:50:44,372 --> 00:50:47,102
And this is
Mr. Brisbane's office.

649
00:50:47,175 --> 00:50:49,609
- Just look at that view.
- Someone's coming. Get down.

650
00:50:49,678 --> 00:50:51,646
- Hold on.

651
00:50:53,748 --> 00:50:56,683
So, I finally have you
all to myself.

652
00:50:56,751 --> 00:51:00,585
Well, I like to come up to Mr. Brisbane's
office when I know he's not here...

653
00:51:00,655 --> 00:51:03,681
It's way too high to climb.
There's gotta be some way to bring it down.

654
00:51:03,758 --> 00:51:06,226
Then come help me look.

655
00:51:07,329 --> 00:51:10,093
Gus!

656
00:51:10,165 --> 00:51:12,326
Gus, come help me!

657
00:51:29,517 --> 00:51:31,508
Holy...

658
00:51:35,123 --> 00:51:37,785
- You know Planet of the Apes?
- Mm-hmm.

659
00:51:37,859 --> 00:51:39,952
I was in that movie.

660
00:51:40,028 --> 00:51:43,361
- I love that movie!

661
00:51:47,535 --> 00:51:49,730
Whoa! That's fresh!

662
00:51:51,306 --> 00:51:54,901
- What'd you do?
- I don't know. I just stepped on this dude's eye.

663
00:51:56,211 --> 00:51:59,578
These numbers match the ones
all over the wall.

664
00:51:59,648 --> 00:52:02,048
They're safety deposit boxes.

665
00:52:05,186 --> 00:52:07,780
I bet you
if we press one...

666
00:52:10,425 --> 00:52:12,416
Whoa.

667
00:52:20,969 --> 00:52:22,903
My mom's gonna kill me.

668
00:52:22,971 --> 00:52:25,337
Retract 3212.

669
00:52:31,413 --> 00:52:33,404
Hit 2357.

670
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:40,854
Mama...

671
00:52:40,922 --> 00:52:43,413
That's right.

672
00:52:43,491 --> 00:52:46,790
Come to mama.
Oh, yeah!

673
00:52:52,434 --> 00:52:54,231
- Mr. Hart...

674
00:52:54,302 --> 00:52:57,863
- And that concludes
our tour of the ninth floor.

675
00:52:57,939 --> 00:53:00,373
Let's get you
back to the party.

676
00:53:05,713 --> 00:53:07,772
- Stockholders.
- Huh.

677
00:53:18,092 --> 00:53:20,083
This is gonna work.

678
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:24,597
Maddy, you can't climb.
This is too dangerous. You'll never make it.

679
00:53:24,665 --> 00:53:26,656
- I'm doing it.
- Austin...

680
00:53:26,734 --> 00:53:30,465
you've gotta hack in the main... whatever
and find some way to bring down the safe.

681
00:53:30,537 --> 00:53:32,505
- Maddy's gonna kill herself.
- Check.

682
00:53:32,573 --> 00:53:36,634
- Searching now.
- Gus, I love you. Now, do what I say.

683
00:53:37,711 --> 00:53:40,771
Okay? 5344.

684
00:53:48,055 --> 00:53:51,252
I'm searching for the hydraulic controls
for the safe, but...

685
00:53:51,325 --> 00:53:53,259
you guys,
I can't find anything.

686
00:53:53,327 --> 00:53:56,455
- What's going on in there?
- 2244.

687
00:53:56,530 --> 00:53:58,862
- You don't wanna know, dude.
- I do wanna know.

688
00:53:58,933 --> 00:54:00,867
What's next?

689
00:54:00,935 --> 00:54:03,165
4231.

690
00:54:06,607 --> 00:54:08,370
- Gus!
- Sorry.

691
00:54:08,442 --> 00:54:13,141
You're killin' me here, dude.
Focus. Retract 4232.

692
00:54:16,417 --> 00:54:18,578
- Good evening, everyone. How are you?

693
00:54:18,652 --> 00:54:21,621
Having a wonderful time, are we?
Terrific.

694
00:54:21,689 --> 00:54:24,522
To our generous
board of directors...

695
00:54:24,591 --> 00:54:28,857
here's to the only type
of success that really matters:

696
00:54:29,964 --> 00:54:32,057
Financial.

697
00:54:33,734 --> 00:54:35,065
Cheers.

698
00:54:36,136 --> 00:54:39,435
Okay, Gus. Last one.
5343.

699
00:54:43,978 --> 00:54:45,912
Security breach.

700
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:47,811
- Security breach.
- And now...

701
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:55,413
Security breach. Security breach.

702
00:54:57,324 --> 00:55:00,851
Do something.

703
00:55:00,928 --> 00:55:05,092
Do something now.
Anything.

704
00:55:05,165 --> 00:55:08,100
- Oh, shoot. Tape?

705
00:55:08,168 --> 00:55:11,899
- Austin, the tape. Run the tape.
- Okay.

706
00:55:21,615 --> 00:55:24,243
Mr. Hartmann,
the alarm has sounded.

707
00:55:24,318 --> 00:55:29,221
Take it easy. It's only me.
Just turn the alarm off.

708
00:55:29,289 --> 00:55:32,281
- I should let out the dogs.
- Calm down, princess.

709
00:55:32,359 --> 00:55:34,793
- It's fine. Just...

710
00:55:34,862 --> 00:55:37,854
Really. No.
Nothing to worry about. It's...

711
00:55:37,931 --> 00:55:42,368
I'm right here.
Just turn off the alarm.

712
00:55:42,436 --> 00:55:44,870
Should I, uh...

713
00:55:44,938 --> 00:55:47,566
Kill the alarm.

714
00:55:54,348 --> 00:55:59,615
- Well, it seems that our security system works.

715
00:55:59,686 --> 00:56:02,553
Yes. It's just a false alarm,
everyone. So why don't we all...

716
00:56:02,623 --> 00:56:05,649
just relax and enjoy
this wonderful party?

717
00:56:05,726 --> 00:56:08,661
- What do you say? Wonderful. Please.

718
00:56:08,729 --> 00:56:13,063
- Something's goin' on here.
I'm gonna find out what it is.

719
00:56:15,369 --> 00:56:17,360
Eyes on the monitor!

720
00:56:26,647 --> 00:56:28,581
I can do this.

721
00:56:37,991 --> 00:56:39,481
Maddy, be careful.

722
00:56:45,866 --> 00:56:47,857
Huh!

723
00:56:53,407 --> 00:56:56,171
Maddy, my parents grounded me for a week
when I left my bike outside.

724
00:56:56,243 --> 00:56:59,235
Imagine what they'll do
if they catch us now.

725
00:57:01,782 --> 00:57:04,615
W-We'll figure out a different way.
It's too dangerous.

726
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:09,355
She's not listening to me.
She clearly doesn't understand.

727
00:57:09,423 --> 00:57:12,722
She's climbing up this stupid wall, and...
Austin, maybe she'll listen to you.

728
00:57:12,793 --> 00:57:15,193
That would be a first.

729
00:57:15,262 --> 00:57:18,254
I wonder if you can finish
the eighth grade in prison.

730
00:57:21,201 --> 00:57:25,035
Oh, wait. If we're in jail,
our parents can't ground us. Right?

731
00:57:39,453 --> 00:57:41,648
Come on.
This cannot be happening.

732
00:57:41,722 --> 00:57:45,317
The cam's stuck.
It's stuck.

733
00:57:47,361 --> 00:57:51,058
Twenty feet from the summit, my gear stuck.

734
00:57:52,599 --> 00:57:55,568
There was this perfect crack
runnin' all the way up to the top.

735
00:58:00,073 --> 00:58:02,064
He free-climbed it.

736
00:58:13,687 --> 00:58:16,451
Maddy, are you
free-climbing this?

737
00:58:17,457 --> 00:58:19,425
Maddy, no.

738
00:58:25,032 --> 00:58:27,262
Maddy, we never
even got to kiss.

739
00:59:38,005 --> 00:59:40,803
She's looking down.
She's looking down!

740
00:59:40,874 --> 00:59:45,208
- Tell her not to.
- Oh, why did I look down? That's high.

741
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:47,645
Maddy, don't look down.

742
00:59:48,915 --> 00:59:52,476
Ooh, that's high.
That's not high.

743
00:59:52,552 --> 00:59:56,352
Okay. All right.

744
00:59:56,423 --> 00:59:58,357
Gus looks like an ant.

745
00:59:58,425 --> 01:00:00,791
Okay. Here goes.

746
01:00:04,765 --> 01:00:07,859
Okay.

747
01:00:07,934 --> 01:00:12,837
One, two...

748
01:00:12,906 --> 01:00:16,706
Two-and-a-half...

749
01:00:19,479 --> 01:00:21,743
- Maddy, no!
- Three.

750
01:00:24,751 --> 01:00:26,878
Whoa!

751
01:00:26,953 --> 01:00:28,250
Maddy!

752
01:00:28,322 --> 01:00:30,153
Aah!

753
01:00:30,223 --> 01:00:32,157
- Gus?

754
01:00:35,395 --> 01:00:38,421
- Oh, no.

755
01:00:38,498 --> 01:00:43,265
She set off a timer, Gus. She has two minutes
to enter the code before the alarm goes off.

756
01:00:43,337 --> 01:00:45,601
Maddy, you've triggered a timer.
You've gotta reach the keypad.

757
01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:02,047
Okay.

758
01:01:08,195 --> 01:01:11,323
"D-E-N-I-R-O."

759
01:01:11,398 --> 01:01:14,060
Access denied.

760
01:01:14,134 --> 01:01:17,365
Oh, no!
"De Niro's" not the code?

761
01:01:17,437 --> 01:01:19,371
Oh, I can't believe it.

762
01:01:19,439 --> 01:01:24,240
- I can't break the access code, Maddy.

763
01:01:24,311 --> 01:01:28,407
Your mom designed the safe,
so the code must be something she chose.

764
01:01:28,482 --> 01:01:33,784
What could it be?
What did you use?

765
01:01:33,854 --> 01:01:38,814
- "Maxwell."

766
01:01:38,892 --> 01:01:41,156
- Access denied.

767
01:01:41,228 --> 01:01:46,325
No! Oh, come on, Maddy! Think!

768
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:50,336
Come on, Maddy.
Come on.

769
01:01:50,404 --> 01:01:52,338
Come on.

770
01:01:52,406 --> 01:01:55,000
What could it be?

771
01:01:55,075 --> 01:01:57,737
Mom, what did you use?

772
01:01:59,980 --> 01:02:02,073
Dad.

773
01:02:07,521 --> 01:02:09,989
- Access denied.

774
01:02:13,126 --> 01:02:15,924
I do think about you, Madeline.

775
01:02:15,996 --> 01:02:18,863
Every day, all the time.

776
01:02:33,914 --> 01:02:35,848
"Madeline."

777
01:02:35,916 --> 01:02:39,283
Access code accepted.

778
01:02:54,968 --> 01:02:58,665
She used my name...
my name as the code.

779
01:02:58,738 --> 01:03:01,707
- In your face, Harderbach Financial.!
- Gus?

780
01:03:01,775 --> 01:03:03,675
What happened?

781
01:03:03,743 --> 01:03:06,211
She made it.
She's in the safe.

782
01:03:09,149 --> 01:03:13,245
- Is the money there?
- Hey, Gus, 250 grand comin' at ya.

783
01:03:18,391 --> 01:03:22,157
Nope.
It's down here.

784
01:03:22,229 --> 01:03:24,322
Good job, Max.

785
01:03:31,638 --> 01:03:34,573
All right. I'll meet you guys at the carts.

786
01:03:36,142 --> 01:03:38,269
Austin, we're
on the move.

787
01:03:38,345 --> 01:03:40,279
Exit code requested.

788
01:03:40,347 --> 01:03:44,807
Five, four, three, two, one.

789
01:03:44,885 --> 01:03:48,446
- Code Red. All sectors beginning lockdown.

790
01:03:49,990 --> 01:03:51,958
Come on, Maddy. Run!

791
01:03:52,025 --> 01:03:54,459
- Hurry up! Come on!

792
01:03:58,698 --> 01:04:00,928
Come on!

793
01:04:02,502 --> 01:04:04,970
- Code Red.

794
01:04:05,038 --> 01:04:10,567
Intruder alert.
Code Red. Intruder alert.

795
01:04:13,380 --> 01:04:15,712
Hello. Yes. Listen, we have a Code Seven
at Harderbach Financial.

796
01:04:15,782 --> 01:04:17,773
Send everyone.
I mean, everyone.

797
01:04:24,524 --> 01:04:27,322
Release the dogs.

798
01:04:29,329 --> 01:04:32,457
- Hurry! It's closing!

799
01:04:32,532 --> 01:04:34,056
Dive!

800
01:04:41,708 --> 01:04:45,303
Do not panic, ladies and gentlemen.!
Would you please take care of this thing?

801
01:04:45,378 --> 01:04:48,108
Tonight
we'll sort this out!

802
01:05:01,428 --> 01:05:04,192
- We gotta get to the hospital.

803
01:05:07,167 --> 01:05:10,933
- He hasn't said a word in his life. Now he won't shut up.
- Hi, Maxie.

804
01:05:11,004 --> 01:05:13,529
- Come here, buddy. Let's go see Dad. All right?

805
01:05:16,876 --> 01:05:19,208
- Doggy.

806
01:05:22,849 --> 01:05:24,840
Austin,
you got this one?

807
01:05:26,019 --> 01:05:28,146
Run!

808
01:05:28,221 --> 01:05:31,213
"Run"? All you had for us was "Run"?

809
01:05:33,393 --> 01:05:35,987
Help! Somebody!

810
01:05:39,299 --> 01:05:42,632
The wall!
Get against the wall.

811
01:05:42,702 --> 01:05:44,294
Get away from me!

812
01:05:52,045 --> 01:05:54,206
- Gus!
- Austin?

813
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:56,578
My bag!

814
01:05:57,584 --> 01:06:00,178
- Not the money...

815
01:06:00,253 --> 01:06:02,551
you dumb...

816
01:06:03,423 --> 01:06:05,983
Okay.

817
01:06:06,059 --> 01:06:09,358
- We gotta get down that chute.

818
01:06:09,429 --> 01:06:12,193
Austin! Come on.
Let's go. Let's go.

819
01:06:12,265 --> 01:06:14,699
Come on, you guys. We have to go.
Oh, God.

820
01:06:22,676 --> 01:06:24,610
Mad-dy.

821
01:06:26,279 --> 01:06:28,270
Ausfahrt!

822
01:06:36,923 --> 01:06:39,858
"Fart"?
That's the code word?

823
01:06:39,926 --> 01:06:43,862
- Come on, you guys. Let's get to the chute.

824
01:06:43,930 --> 01:06:47,730
- Uh-oh.

825
01:07:09,355 --> 01:07:11,448
What have we here?

826
01:07:11,524 --> 01:07:13,492
It's not what you think.
We were just...

827
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:17,826
- Save it, doll-face.
- We were at the party...

828
01:07:17,897 --> 01:07:21,230
Zip it,
or I'll zip it for you!

829
01:07:22,635 --> 01:07:25,069
Well, young Chadley.

830
01:07:25,138 --> 01:07:28,938
It looks like we've caught
our first little trespassers.

831
01:07:29,008 --> 01:07:34,947
And since no one
is here to claim them...

832
01:07:35,014 --> 01:07:38,973
then no one
will hear them scream!

833
01:07:41,588 --> 01:07:43,749
First, we're gonna...

834
01:07:44,824 --> 01:07:47,486
Where's my thingy?

835
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:49,494
- Lookin' for this, Lieutenant?

836
01:08:07,112 --> 01:08:09,046
What are you gonna do, bro?

837
01:08:10,449 --> 01:08:13,441
You just get that money
to Mr. P, all right?

838
01:08:15,554 --> 01:08:17,988
Don't you forget
who got you outta this one. All right?

839
01:08:18,057 --> 01:08:20,150
Bad Chad don't do
this kind of thing all the...

840
01:08:24,630 --> 01:08:28,691
- Hey, you guys, we really gotta go.

841
01:08:41,580 --> 01:08:44,310
Geronimo!

842
01:08:47,987 --> 01:08:50,854
Whoa!

843
01:08:50,923 --> 01:08:53,915
Okay, here goes
nothi-i-ing!

844
01:08:54,994 --> 01:08:57,258
Mother?

845
01:08:57,329 --> 01:08:59,354
Ah!
Oh, God!

846
01:09:10,542 --> 01:09:12,908
- Where's Max? Max!
- Max?

847
01:09:12,978 --> 01:09:17,039
- Max.
- Max.

848
01:09:17,116 --> 01:09:18,845
- Max!
- Whee!

849
01:09:23,322 --> 01:09:26,416
- Max, you all right?

850
01:09:42,474 --> 01:09:44,101
What's that?

851
01:09:44,176 --> 01:09:46,940
- What?
- Around your neck.

852
01:09:47,012 --> 01:09:49,105
Oh.

853
01:09:51,784 --> 01:09:54,252
Well, um...

854
01:09:54,319 --> 01:09:58,449
Well, I guess
we got something to tell ya.

855
01:10:00,192 --> 01:10:02,456
Oh, yeah?

856
01:10:04,196 --> 01:10:07,597
You guys, we do not have time for this
right now. Come on. Let's go.

857
01:10:09,835 --> 01:10:13,737
I am not goin' anywhere
until I find out why Gus has on my chain.

858
01:10:15,708 --> 01:10:17,767
She played us.

859
01:10:18,877 --> 01:10:20,970
That sucks, Maddy.

860
01:10:22,381 --> 01:10:25,043
- Let's get outta here, man.
- Yeah. I'm right behind you.

861
01:10:35,094 --> 01:10:38,086
It's just me and you, Max.

862
01:10:48,841 --> 01:10:51,537
I think I'm low on gas.

863
01:10:51,610 --> 01:10:54,977
You should have
enough to get back.

864
01:10:58,784 --> 01:11:01,275
Love hurts, huh?

865
01:11:03,255 --> 01:11:07,487
- You kids
in the carts, pull over now.

866
01:11:07,559 --> 01:11:10,050
Pull over immediately.

867
01:11:10,129 --> 01:11:14,657
Gus, I don't wanna be
a juvenile delinquent.

868
01:11:14,733 --> 01:11:17,861
- Austin, pedal to the metal.

869
01:11:17,936 --> 01:11:20,962
All units respond,
2-11, Harderbach Financial.

870
01:11:21,039 --> 01:11:24,634
Car 22 in pursuit of
two go-carts fleeing the scene of a robbery.

871
01:11:27,045 --> 01:11:31,414
22, repeat.
Uh, it sounded like you said "go-carts."

872
01:11:31,483 --> 01:11:33,974
- Gus, I am out of gas.

873
01:11:34,052 --> 01:11:36,543
- I'm goin' down.
- Jump onto my cart.

874
01:11:36,622 --> 01:11:38,556
What? Are you crazy?

875
01:11:39,758 --> 01:11:42,192
Hurry up.
The cops are right behind us.

876
01:11:42,261 --> 01:11:44,252
One, two...

877
01:11:44,329 --> 01:11:46,991
- What happened to "three"?

878
01:11:50,602 --> 01:11:52,536
Okay, buddy. Hang on.

879
01:11:52,604 --> 01:11:54,868
Now turn! Look out for the truck.

880
01:11:54,940 --> 01:11:57,033
I got it. I got it.

881
01:11:58,977 --> 01:12:00,740
Gus, they're right behind us!

882
01:12:07,653 --> 01:12:09,883
- Gus, look out for the curb!
- Oh, God.

883
01:12:14,092 --> 01:12:17,459
- Yeah! They're stuck!
Twenty-two requesting backup.

884
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:24,363
Wait. We're gonna lose 'em. Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

885
01:12:25,370 --> 01:12:27,964
Come on, cart! Come on!

886
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:29,735
This is the L.A.P.D. You are surrounded.

887
01:12:29,808 --> 01:12:31,901
Pull over your go-cart
immediately.

888
01:12:31,977 --> 01:12:33,638
Oh, yeah! Now we have a spotlight.

889
01:12:33,712 --> 01:12:36,613
You have left the scene of a crime.
Pull over your go-cart.

890
01:12:36,682 --> 01:12:38,980
Gus, we're dead now.
We'll never get away in this thing.

891
01:12:39,051 --> 01:12:42,043
I've got a few tricks up my sleeve.
Don't worry.

892
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:44,588
Chopper One splitting off.

893
01:12:47,993 --> 01:12:50,052
- The helicopter's goin'away.
- Hey, what's he doin'?

894
01:12:52,231 --> 01:12:54,961
Okay, Austin.
Now let's get rid of these two cops.

895
01:12:55,033 --> 01:13:00,437
You're about to experience a hundred P.S.I.
Of pure NOS. Hold on!

896
01:13:03,709 --> 01:13:06,769
Here they come.
Chopper One. We've got 'em.

897
01:13:06,845 --> 01:13:09,109
The helicopter's back! We're trapped!

898
01:13:09,181 --> 01:13:11,775
- Do not approach the helicopter.
- Gus, what are you doing?

899
01:13:11,850 --> 01:13:14,011
- We have you surrounded.
- Maybe we should pull over.

900
01:13:14,086 --> 01:13:16,646
- Stop your go-cart.
- We're goin' under.

901
01:13:16,722 --> 01:13:19,020
- No! Don't go under!
- I'm gonna do it!

902
01:13:19,091 --> 01:13:20,683
No!

903
01:13:25,731 --> 01:13:28,325
- That was crazy.
- I know. It was close.

904
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:30,664
- I'm so good, I...
- Gus, look at the road!

905
01:13:30,736 --> 01:13:32,863
Look out for this truck!
Gus, look!

906
01:13:32,938 --> 01:13:35,099
- Duck!

907
01:13:41,213 --> 01:13:43,204
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!
- Yeah!

908
01:13:47,352 --> 01:13:49,820
- That is so...

909
01:13:49,888 --> 01:13:52,516
- Oh!

910
01:13:52,591 --> 01:13:55,151
Whew. Man, did you see that helicopter?
Oh, that was great.

911
01:13:55,227 --> 01:13:58,162
- Do you think Maddy made it?
- Yeah.

912
01:13:58,230 --> 01:14:00,721
Yeah. I'm sure she did.
I mean...

913
01:14:00,799 --> 01:14:02,994
- Cops followed us. Right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

914
01:14:03,068 --> 01:14:05,400
I'm sure she made it.
I'm sure you're right.

915
01:14:13,378 --> 01:14:18,145
- We've got to go back, don't we?
- Yeah. Let's go get her.

916
01:14:18,216 --> 01:14:22,243
- Okay, Austin. Jump on now.

917
01:14:22,321 --> 01:14:25,051
Let's go. Let's get Maddy.

918
01:14:27,125 --> 01:14:28,820
Duck!

919
01:14:30,963 --> 01:14:34,296
- Faster! Faster!
- They'll never catch us, Austin.

920
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:37,525
All right, Max.
Almost there.

921
01:14:39,404 --> 01:14:41,998
Only one more block.

922
01:14:45,978 --> 01:14:47,843
- Uh-oh.

923
01:14:51,083 --> 01:14:54,246
Two-seventy-two, I think we found 'em.

924
01:14:54,319 --> 01:14:56,253
Okay.
Hold on, Maxie.

925
01:14:57,823 --> 01:15:00,587
- Maddy, we're back!

926
01:15:00,659 --> 01:15:03,685
- You guys, what are we gonna do? We'll never outrun these cops.
- I got it covered.

927
01:15:03,762 --> 01:15:06,356
- Just don't fall behind me.
- Okay.

928
01:15:06,431 --> 01:15:08,899
You kids in the carts, pull over now.

929
01:15:08,967 --> 01:15:11,231
- Gus! They're getting closer!
- Not for long.

930
01:15:11,303 --> 01:15:14,636
Here it goes: Operation Jacks!

931
01:15:28,186 --> 01:15:31,485
Yee-haw! I am a genius!

932
01:15:31,556 --> 01:15:34,389
Car 14, we've been disabled
at the corner of Grand and Wilshire.

933
01:15:34,459 --> 01:15:36,450
Thanks, guys. Now, keep up!

934
01:15:36,528 --> 01:15:38,519
- We're right behind you, Maddy.
- Backup requested.

935
01:15:38,597 --> 01:15:41,794
- Harderbach robbery suspects on the loose.
- Alan!

936
01:15:41,867 --> 01:15:44,927
- I just heard. How much did they get away with?
- Who's this?

937
01:15:45,003 --> 01:15:47,164
Uh, she's the head
of security.

938
01:15:47,239 --> 01:15:49,571
Three suspects.
They got away on go-carts.

939
01:15:49,641 --> 01:15:51,609
They hit you for $250,000.

940
01:15:51,676 --> 01:15:55,271
- Go-carts?
- Yeah. We also found this in the vault room.

941
01:15:56,415 --> 01:15:58,610
They used it to climb
up to the safe.

942
01:15:58,683 --> 01:16:01,811
- Do you have the perpetrators in custody?
- Not yet.

943
01:16:01,887 --> 01:16:04,981
What I want to know is, why would someone
break into a safe with $25 million...

944
01:16:05,057 --> 01:16:07,617
and steal only $250,000?

945
01:16:07,692 --> 01:16:12,356
Excuse me! There she is! She's our so-called
head of security. This is all her fault!

946
01:16:12,431 --> 01:16:15,867
- Actually, Mr. Brisbane, I did...
- Uh, Mr. Brisbane, with all due respect...

947
01:16:15,934 --> 01:16:19,097
- Molly did tell you that the security system had not been tested.
- Really?

948
01:16:19,171 --> 01:16:21,469
Well, you just got your walking papers.
Didn't you, Hartmann?

949
01:16:23,608 --> 01:16:26,270
Are you talkin' to me?

950
01:16:26,344 --> 01:16:29,279
Are you talkin' to me?

951
01:16:29,347 --> 01:16:34,011
Well, you must be talkin' to me, 'cause there's
nobody else here. So you must be talkin' to me!

952
01:16:38,290 --> 01:16:40,281
Excuse me.

953
01:16:41,793 --> 01:16:44,159
Monsieur Nuffaut,
I must apologize...

954
01:16:44,229 --> 01:16:46,060
for this strange debacle.

955
01:16:46,131 --> 01:16:49,794
- I assure you...
- It's not me you owe an apology to, Brisbane.

956
01:16:49,868 --> 01:16:53,668
If the head of security told you...

957
01:16:53,738 --> 01:16:57,504
the system is not ready,
then it seems like a... how do you say...

958
01:16:57,576 --> 01:17:00,340
a knucklehead move
to go ahead with this soiree.

959
01:17:02,380 --> 01:17:05,406
Je suis d? Sol? Madame.
The blame falls squarely on your shoulders.

960
01:17:05,484 --> 01:17:07,452
On y va, ch? Rie.

961
01:17:08,453 --> 01:17:12,890
Monsieur Nuffaut!
Oh, Fran? Ois!

962
01:17:21,133 --> 01:17:23,067
Couldn't stay away, huh?

963
01:17:25,003 --> 01:17:26,937
Let's go
save your dad.

964
01:17:56,368 --> 01:17:58,734
Maddy,
what are you doing?

965
01:17:58,803 --> 01:18:01,203
I have the money for the operation, Dad.
We're goin' to Denmark.

966
01:18:01,273 --> 01:18:03,639
- What are you talking about?
- I got the money!

967
01:18:03,708 --> 01:18:05,938
- Honey.

968
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:11,114
What have you done?

969
01:18:12,450 --> 01:18:14,611
- Maddy, we gotta go!

970
01:18:17,355 --> 01:18:19,823
What are you doing?

971
01:18:33,071 --> 01:18:36,097
Madeline, what...

972
01:18:38,376 --> 01:18:41,174
Mom, I have...
I have the money. We can go.

973
01:18:54,092 --> 01:18:56,083
Molly, what is...
what is this?

974
01:19:08,406 --> 01:19:10,533
I warned him...

975
01:19:12,244 --> 01:19:14,940
that the system
wasn't online yet.

976
01:19:15,013 --> 01:19:17,004
I know.

977
01:19:21,286 --> 01:19:23,220
And to prove to everyone...

978
01:19:24,289 --> 01:19:26,985
just how vulnerable
the bank was...

979
01:19:27,058 --> 01:19:31,392
I had my daughter and her two friends...
three kids... rob the bank.

980
01:19:31,463 --> 01:19:33,897
And I think if you look
in my contract, you will see...

981
01:19:33,965 --> 01:19:37,162
that I have a license
to perform undisclosed tests to the system...

982
01:19:37,235 --> 01:19:40,636
until such date as the system
is deemed fully operable.

983
01:19:43,775 --> 01:19:46,300
Are you buying
any of this?

984
01:19:47,712 --> 01:19:50,340
Yeah.

985
01:19:51,950 --> 01:19:54,510
Molly was authorized
to hire consultants...

986
01:19:54,586 --> 01:19:56,986
to test the system.

987
01:19:57,055 --> 01:19:59,046
This was all a plan...

988
01:19:59,124 --> 01:20:00,853
a brilliant plan.

989
01:20:07,632 --> 01:20:09,623
All right.
Could you step back, please?

990
01:20:16,775 --> 01:20:19,005
Mrs. Phillips... Mrs. Phillips, is it true...

991
01:20:19,077 --> 01:20:21,443
your daughter is a leading suspect
in the robbery?

992
01:20:21,513 --> 01:20:24,209
- Sir?
- Mrs. Phillips, please?

993
01:20:24,282 --> 01:20:28,981
Ready? We understand three children
were involved in the high-speed pursuit...

994
01:20:29,054 --> 01:20:31,318
ending up here
at Community Wide Hospital.

995
01:20:31,389 --> 01:20:33,823
Details are sketchy,
but it appears the children...

996
01:20:33,892 --> 01:20:37,453
have robbed Harderbach Financial
of nearly a quarter-million...

997
01:20:37,529 --> 01:20:39,622
And a source inside the bank
is saying the robbery...

998
01:20:39,698 --> 01:20:42,929
was actually some type of plot
to test the bank's security...

999
01:20:43,001 --> 01:20:45,299
Now, stories are swirling,
but this reporter has learned...

1000
01:20:45,370 --> 01:20:48,533
that one of the children has a father
in desperate need of an operation.

1001
01:20:48,606 --> 01:20:50,597
The child
has not been identified...

1002
01:20:50,675 --> 01:20:54,304
but her father is registered
in the hospital as Tom Phillips.

1003
01:20:54,379 --> 01:20:58,679
Now, Mr. Phillips runs a local go-cart track,
and is expected to return home tomorrow...

1004
01:20:58,750 --> 01:21:02,083
- since insurance will not cover his operation.
- Maddy?

1005
01:21:02,153 --> 01:21:05,213
I'm Maria Quiban,
Channel 10 News.

1006
01:21:13,698 --> 01:21:16,667
You know what you did was wrong.

1007
01:21:19,738 --> 01:21:24,835
- Yeah, I know.
- And I know I haven't really been there for you.

1008
01:21:25,910 --> 01:21:28,310
But that's gonna change. Okay?

1009
01:21:36,020 --> 01:21:38,648
- I love you.
- I love you too, Maddy.

1010
01:21:38,723 --> 01:21:41,157
You have such a big heart.

1011
01:21:43,061 --> 01:21:46,265
You guys gotta come down the track.
You're not gonna believe this.

1012
01:22:03,448 --> 01:22:07,441
- They're coming.

1013
01:22:13,358 --> 01:22:16,020
What are they doing?

1014
01:22:16,094 --> 01:22:19,586
- Waiting to buy tickets.
- Come on. Let's go.

1015
01:22:29,374 --> 01:22:31,808
- Hey, Maddy.
- Hey.

1016
01:22:31,877 --> 01:22:34,641
Skip, the tickets
are only three bucks.

1017
01:22:34,713 --> 01:22:37,477
- Keep the change. Tell your dad to feel better.
- Thanks.

1018
01:22:37,549 --> 01:22:41,041
- That's three dollars.
- Well, here's a hundred from my parents.

1019
01:22:42,554 --> 01:22:44,988
Thank you.
Wait. Here's your ticket.

1020
01:22:45,057 --> 01:22:47,992
- Six dollars. Here you go.
- Tell Mr. P, "Feel better."

1021
01:22:49,061 --> 01:22:51,052
Ho-ho.

1022
01:23:00,138 --> 01:23:02,163
- How much?
- 400.

1023
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:04,800
- I have 300.

1024
01:23:04,876 --> 01:23:07,470
- Here's two here.
- Wait. Plus...

1025
01:23:11,416 --> 01:23:13,350
Well?

1026
01:23:13,418 --> 01:23:16,444
Even with the donations
from the news station, we're still short.

1027
01:23:16,521 --> 01:23:20,082
- Molly?

1028
01:23:20,158 --> 01:23:22,786
- Mr. Hartmann.
- You forgot something...

1029
01:23:22,861 --> 01:23:27,127
the consultant fee for the company
you hired to pull off the robbery.

1030
01:23:33,372 --> 01:23:35,863
Holy...
$50,000?

1031
01:23:35,941 --> 01:23:38,273
Ah. The hair.
The hair.

1032
01:23:38,343 --> 01:23:41,073
Well, that should
get you pretty close.

1033
01:23:41,146 --> 01:23:44,582
And the president of the bank has authorized
any personal loan to cover the difference.

1034
01:23:44,649 --> 01:23:46,276
Mr. Brisbane
already said that...

1035
01:23:46,351 --> 01:23:50,617
I'm afraid he's not with the bank anymore,
so call me for whatever you need.

1036
01:23:50,689 --> 01:23:54,716
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

1037
01:23:57,629 --> 01:23:59,563
- I finally got my starring role.

1038
01:24:03,568 --> 01:24:06,059
- $50,000!

1039
01:24:06,138 --> 01:24:08,402
Yes! No.

1040
01:24:13,779 --> 01:24:17,738
- Here, Maxie.
- Go, Maxie. Ready?

1041
01:24:17,816 --> 01:24:19,511
Go.
Go, Maxie.

1042
01:24:35,567 --> 01:24:38,536
- Yeah! Whoo!
- Yeah!

1043
01:24:45,944 --> 01:24:50,108
Okay. Here we go. Get ready for the first race
of the day! And I know who you want...

1044
01:24:50,182 --> 01:24:52,776
callin' the race,
and it sure ain't me!

1045
01:24:52,851 --> 01:24:54,785
Hey, Dad.

1046
01:24:55,854 --> 01:24:57,822
Thank you, Madeline.

1047
01:25:06,698 --> 01:25:08,791
All right, race fans!

1048
01:25:08,867 --> 01:25:13,566
Who do we got in the first race?
Uh-oh. It's John "The Rammer" McGillicuddy.

1049
01:25:13,638 --> 01:25:16,505
He's brought out
his cart Demolition.

1050
01:25:16,575 --> 01:25:20,739
Watch out for him in turn number four.
Oh, my God.

1051
01:25:20,812 --> 01:25:23,747
You know what time it is,
so let's hit the gas...

1052
01:25:23,815 --> 01:25:26,477
- and kick some... butt.

1053
01:25:26,551 --> 01:25:28,849
- It's race time! Yeah!

1054
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:33,186
- Dada.
- Oh! That's right. That's your daddy.

1055
01:25:33,258 --> 01:25:36,022
- Whoo-hoo!

1056
01:26:06,958 --> 01:26:08,892
Why do I have to choose
between you guys?

1057
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:11,190
'Cause you can't have two boyfriends.
Come on.

1058
01:26:29,881 --> 01:26:32,111
Okay.

1059
01:26:32,183 --> 01:26:34,242
I've made up my mind.

1060
01:26:36,855 --> 01:26:38,584
Turn around.

1061
01:26:46,331 --> 01:26:48,799
No matter what,
we'll still be friends. Right?

1062
01:26:49,868 --> 01:26:51,836
Are you kidding?

1063
01:26:51,903 --> 01:26:54,667
You're gonna be
our best man.

1064
01:26:56,675 --> 01:26:58,973
- Go get her!
- Maddy!

1065
01:26:59,044 --> 01:27:01,478
Maddy, wait up!

1066
01:27:01,546 --> 01:27:04,845
- Come on! You didn't choose!
- Pick me. Austin's a geek!

1067
01:27:04,916 --> 01:27:09,080
- Gus is a blockhead!
- Dream on, guys. You'll never catch me. My legs are longer.

1068
01:27:09,154 --> 01:27:11,645
- I'm gonna get you, Maddy.

1069
01:27:11,723 --> 01:27:14,089
You'll never catch me.
