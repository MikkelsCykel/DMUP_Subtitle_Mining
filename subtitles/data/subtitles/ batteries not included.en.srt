1
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:12,532
How you doing?

2
00:04:12,604 --> 00:04:13,913
What's happening?

3
00:04:15,485 --> 00:04:17,143
All right.

4
00:04:17,213 --> 00:04:18,424
Pick it up.

5
00:04:18,493 --> 00:04:20,151
Whoa!

6
00:04:20,221 --> 00:04:21,716
Look out.

7
00:04:21,789 --> 00:04:22,683
Coming through.

8
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,401
You have to tell me
where to turn.

9
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:44,507
I knew it.

10
00:04:44,577 --> 00:04:46,366
She's not here.

11
00:04:46,433 --> 00:04:47,960
Frank! Sidney!

12
00:04:48,034 --> 00:04:49,823
I'll try the basement.

13
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,232
Don't panic.

14
00:04:51,298 --> 00:04:53,186
She's around here somewhere.

15
00:04:54,275 --> 00:04:55,202
Faye!

16
00:04:56,643 --> 00:04:58,018
Come on out!

17
00:05:08,294 --> 00:05:09,919
Hey, you, you!

18
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:12,805
Hey, did you ever hear
of private property?

19
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:16,325
Just coming for
a hamburger, Pop.

20
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:18,300
You got a lot
of nerve!

21
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:20,131
Get your food
somewheres else!

22
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:21,509
Who's that?

23
00:05:21,576 --> 00:05:24,446
Take off that hat so
I can get a look at you.

24
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:27,107
Here she is.
Faye!

25
00:05:27,177 --> 00:05:29,860
For the love of Mike,
where you been?

26
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:32,745
You scared the living
daylights out of me!

27
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:34,185
I did the marketing.

28
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,584
Somebody's got to do
the marketing.

29
00:05:38,378 --> 00:05:39,272
Oh.

30
00:05:41,259 --> 00:05:43,593
OK, what are you
looking at?

31
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,034
Nothing, Pop.

32
00:05:45,099 --> 00:05:46,758
Nothing.

33
00:05:46,828 --> 00:05:48,683
Was that Bobby?

34
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:50,603
I think
it was Bobby.

35
00:05:50,668 --> 00:05:53,702
No, dear,
it wasn't Bobby.

36
00:05:53,773 --> 00:05:55,846
It was just a man.

37
00:05:55,917 --> 00:05:58,733
Now, how about
I fix your breakfast?

38
00:06:00,047 --> 00:06:02,381
I don't smell no bacon on.

39
00:06:02,447 --> 00:06:03,821
Is this Sunday?

40
00:06:03,887 --> 00:06:06,703
Monday and Tuesday
don't smell at all

41
00:06:06,768 --> 00:06:09,102
because Cream of Wheat
is instant.

42
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:10,542
And it ain't Thursday.

43
00:06:10,608 --> 00:06:13,326
I can smell Thursday
all the way back to Wednesday

44
00:06:13,393 --> 00:06:15,815
when people put
their garbage out.

45
00:06:15,889 --> 00:06:19,185
If it's Sunday,
we got to walk in the park.

46
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,624
Sure.

47
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:22,032
Hey, Sid.

48
00:06:22,098 --> 00:06:25,481
Why don't you kids
come for a walk with us?

49
00:06:25,555 --> 00:06:28,370
Yeah, sure, Faye.
That sounds great.

50
00:06:49,847 --> 00:06:51,538
Get off.

51
00:06:51,607 --> 00:06:52,785
Hola, Mommy.

52
00:06:54,231 --> 00:06:55,311
Look.

53
00:06:55,384 --> 00:06:56,759
Smell like money?

54
00:06:56,824 --> 00:06:58,198
Because it is.

55
00:07:08,634 --> 00:07:10,871
Aw, he didn't write.

56
00:07:10,939 --> 00:07:12,946
Take it from me.
I know about this stuff.

57
00:07:13,019 --> 00:07:14,808
He ain't coming back.

58
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:17,691
This is the letter
you've been waiting for.

59
00:07:18,876 --> 00:07:21,364
Come on, you're
a very rich lady.

60
00:07:21,436 --> 00:07:24,306
Hey, take it!
What's wrong with you?

61
00:07:24,381 --> 00:07:25,810
Fresh cash money.

62
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:28,922
She doesn't believe me.

63
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,845
You could move
to Brooklyn.

64
00:07:36,895 --> 00:07:40,059
Here.
Buy yourself a new saint.

65
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:42,168
You can
afford it now.

66
00:07:49,601 --> 00:07:50,714
Room service!

67
00:07:53,698 --> 00:07:55,521
It's moving day,
Picasso!

68
00:08:03,652 --> 00:08:04,546
Yo, Bee.

69
00:08:04,612 --> 00:08:06,947
Don't you even want
to count it?

70
00:08:07,012 --> 00:08:09,379
They're paying you
to move out.

71
00:08:13,349 --> 00:08:14,277
Aah! Oh!

72
00:08:16,709 --> 00:08:19,328
Hey, doll.
He's not home?

73
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:21,438
How about you
move in with me?

74
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:22,885
This, uh,
place here,

75
00:08:22,951 --> 00:08:24,195
it's, uh,
falling apart.

76
00:08:24,263 --> 00:08:26,369
No! Don't! Get-

77
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,388
Aah!

78
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,815
Hey, Bee!

79
00:08:38,025 --> 00:08:40,000
Hey, Bee?

80
00:08:40,074 --> 00:08:41,001
It's us.

81
00:08:43,371 --> 00:08:44,931
The knock-knock boys.

82
00:08:47,307 --> 00:08:49,642
Let's punch it out
again, champ.

83
00:08:49,707 --> 00:08:50,787
Round two!

84
00:08:59,854 --> 00:09:01,545
How's the face, man?

85
00:09:01,614 --> 00:09:03,469
You ready
for a rematch?

86
00:09:04,846 --> 00:09:07,214
Yesterday,
we got rough.

87
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,905
Today,
we got money.

88
00:09:09,935 --> 00:09:11,790
Tomorrow, you ain't gone-

89
00:09:20,657 --> 00:09:23,657
There, now you got
less to move.

90
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:25,704
And here's
your prize money.

91
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,438
Where's the boys?

92
00:09:39,508 --> 00:09:41,363
I don't hear them playing.

93
00:09:42,516 --> 00:09:43,760
Bobby!

94
00:09:43,828 --> 00:09:45,203
Donald!

95
00:09:45,269 --> 00:09:49,678
Donald's
all grown up, Faye.

96
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,565
He has two kids
of his own now.

97
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:54,386
I'm a grandmother,
remember?

98
00:09:54,454 --> 00:09:55,348
Oh, yeah.

99
00:09:55,415 --> 00:09:58,830
Now, sit down
and finish your coffee.

100
00:09:58,903 --> 00:10:00,147
But where's my Bobby?

101
00:10:01,656 --> 00:10:04,112
Get out of my place,
you punks!

102
00:10:04,185 --> 00:10:06,738
Mr. Riley,
it's your lucky day!

103
00:10:06,809 --> 00:10:08,184
You, too, Pops.

104
00:10:08,249 --> 00:10:10,802
Social security,
that's me.

105
00:10:10,873 --> 00:10:14,135
Now, you move out,
you go to Miami,

106
00:10:14,202 --> 00:10:17,301
you sit in the sun,
listen to Bing Crosby,

107
00:10:17,371 --> 00:10:19,500
play checkers, bingo...

108
00:10:19,575 --> 00:10:22,325
- We don't want any trouble, Carlos.
- Hallelujah!

109
00:10:22,392 --> 00:10:25,295
- Don't touch it!
- Too late, man. She already took it.

110
00:10:25,369 --> 00:10:28,053
- You're an angel, Bobby.
- I'm calling the cops!

111
00:10:28,121 --> 00:10:31,634
- Faye, time for your medicine.
- Let Mama give you a pucker.

112
00:10:31,705 --> 00:10:34,870
Never knew you had a mother.
Buenos dias, senora!

113
00:10:34,938 --> 00:10:36,312
Shut up, Benny.

114
00:10:36,378 --> 00:10:38,167
You got the idea,
right?

115
00:10:38,235 --> 00:10:41,170
You take the money
and move out, OK?

116
00:10:41,244 --> 00:10:42,869
Get out of my way!

117
00:10:42,939 --> 00:10:44,663
Let the boy
help you.

118
00:10:44,732 --> 00:10:47,864
You never give him a chance.
Bobby!

119
00:10:47,932 --> 00:10:49,307
Stop calling me that!

120
00:10:49,373 --> 00:10:51,228
Get her out of here.
And you-

121
00:10:51,293 --> 00:10:54,589
Stay away from my wife
and this building.

122
00:10:54,653 --> 00:10:57,850
You tell Lacey his money stinks!
You understand?

123
00:10:57,918 --> 00:11:00,602
You kill my head, man.

124
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,645
Money's not
a good reason to move?

125
00:11:02,719 --> 00:11:04,574
OK, here's
a good reason.

126
00:11:10,209 --> 00:11:11,965
That's right, abuela.
Break it up.

127
00:11:12,032 --> 00:11:13,014
Aah!

128
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,479
- Come on, Faye.
- Throw him out!

129
00:11:15,553 --> 00:11:16,928
We'll talk about it later.

130
00:11:16,993 --> 00:11:17,887
Frank!

131
00:11:17,953 --> 00:11:19,328
You punks!

132
00:11:19,394 --> 00:11:21,696
Take your hands
off of me!

133
00:11:31,908 --> 00:11:34,723
Get out, Pop.
You're going to go bald!

134
00:11:34,788 --> 00:11:36,163
You dirty bastards!

135
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:38,499
Hey, take it easy, Pop.

136
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:39,841
No!

137
00:11:59,145 --> 00:12:00,770
At fine stores
everywhere.

138
00:12:00,841 --> 00:12:02,336
Batteries
not included.

139
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:10,785
Lacey!

140
00:12:13,995 --> 00:12:15,817
Hey, no, you don't!

141
00:12:15,884 --> 00:12:18,121
Lacey, you son of a bitch!

142
00:12:18,188 --> 00:12:20,522
You're not
getting away with it!

143
00:12:22,861 --> 00:12:26,157
Lacey, open up
and face me like a man!

144
00:12:26,221 --> 00:12:28,076
You're not
throwing me out!

145
00:12:29,774 --> 00:12:32,589
You really think that
he'd come down here?

146
00:12:32,654 --> 00:12:34,509
Take the money,
Mr. Riley.

147
00:12:34,575 --> 00:12:35,949
It's our last offer.

148
00:12:47,665 --> 00:12:50,895
This is my place!
I grew up here, for God's sake!

149
00:12:50,962 --> 00:12:52,872
What do you want us
to do, Mr. Riley?

150
00:12:52,946 --> 00:12:55,664
Arrest them.
Send them up the river for life.

151
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:58,578
- I'm not scared. I'll testify.
- You know what'll happen.

152
00:12:58,643 --> 00:13:00,815
They'll have 18 witnesses
saying they were somewhere else.

153
00:13:00,883 --> 00:13:04,331
When they get out,
they'll come after you again.

154
00:13:04,404 --> 00:13:07,219
Then patrol the neighborhood,
for crying out loud!

155
00:13:09,269 --> 00:13:10,447
What neighborhood?

156
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,961
What the hell happened?

157
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:20,405
Mind your own business.

158
00:13:20,471 --> 00:13:23,471
Wait a minute.
I live here. Upstairs.

159
00:13:23,543 --> 00:13:26,708
Oh, yeah. I've seen you.
You're in Moskowitz' old place.

160
00:13:26,776 --> 00:13:29,711
Mr. Baylor,
do you honestly think

161
00:13:29,785 --> 00:13:33,081
I could recommend this building
for historic preservation?

162
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:36,441
Mrs. Thompson, it was
in better shape this morning.

163
00:13:36,506 --> 00:13:37,880
I doubt that.

164
00:13:37,946 --> 00:13:39,353
Yeah.
Look at the molding.

165
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:41,491
Look...
look at the cornice.

166
00:13:41,562 --> 00:13:43,537
That's terra cotta.

167
00:13:43,611 --> 00:13:45,815
Oh, you don't like ornament.
All right.

168
00:13:45,883 --> 00:13:48,436
Step back here and look
at those proportionates.

169
00:13:48,507 --> 00:13:53,243
- It's got style. It's got dignity.
- There's nothing left to preserve.

170
00:13:53,308 --> 00:13:55,960
This one's still here.
It can be restored.

171
00:13:56,029 --> 00:13:57,785
We have
a minimum standard-

172
00:13:57,853 --> 00:14:00,188
that the structure
is intact and livable.

173
00:14:00,254 --> 00:14:02,109
You don't
even have that.

174
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,549
People live here.

175
00:14:04,734 --> 00:14:06,295
Not for long.

176
00:14:37,284 --> 00:14:40,067
Look, you're so nervous.
I'll fix the door.

177
00:14:40,132 --> 00:14:41,954
It's not the door,
Mason.

178
00:14:42,021 --> 00:14:42,969
It's you.

179
00:14:43,045 --> 00:14:45,828
You and your fascination
with this place.

180
00:14:45,893 --> 00:14:47,748
What? I like it here.

181
00:14:47,813 --> 00:14:50,301
Of course you do.
It's old and depressing.

182
00:14:50,374 --> 00:14:51,781
It's reality!

183
00:14:53,095 --> 00:14:54,950
This is
the eighties, Mason.

184
00:14:55,015 --> 00:14:57,252
Nobody likes reality
anymore.

185
00:14:57,319 --> 00:14:59,229
Why don't you admit it?

186
00:14:59,304 --> 00:15:01,092
It's time to quit.

187
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:04,455
Thank you very much.
How do you know that?

188
00:15:04,521 --> 00:15:05,895
You said so yourself!

189
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,165
You said that
you were going nowhere!

190
00:15:08,233 --> 00:15:13,154
You could do analytic deconstruction,
neo-geo, hard edge.

191
00:15:13,226 --> 00:15:16,871
But no, you've got to be
the Andrew Wyeth of the East Village.

192
00:15:18,635 --> 00:15:21,800
Why don't you go back to your father
and sell vans or rec-vs,

193
00:15:21,868 --> 00:15:23,242
or whatever they're called.

194
00:15:23,308 --> 00:15:24,235
RVs.

195
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:27,748
But for God's sake,
get out of here.

196
00:15:27,821 --> 00:15:30,636
And to think that
I've been telling my friends

197
00:15:30,701 --> 00:15:32,971
that it's so cool
living with an artist!

198
00:15:33,038 --> 00:15:35,853
You never once asked
to paint me nude!

199
00:15:46,064 --> 00:15:48,399
Hey, man, stop
right here, man!

200
00:15:48,464 --> 00:15:49,991
All right!

201
00:15:54,225 --> 00:15:55,272
Sorry.

202
00:16:02,706 --> 00:16:04,561
It's OK, Frank.
She's here.

203
00:16:04,626 --> 00:16:06,153
She's been helping.

204
00:16:07,348 --> 00:16:10,163
- Give it to me.
- I called Donald.

205
00:16:10,228 --> 00:16:11,603
He made the arrangements.

206
00:16:11,668 --> 00:16:14,189
For what?
A funeral?

207
00:16:15,829 --> 00:16:17,356
We're going to Jersey.

208
00:16:18,389 --> 00:16:20,724
It's a home
for senior citizens.

209
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,244
You took their money.

210
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:28,561
You took that
bastard's money.

211
00:16:28,631 --> 00:16:31,446
There's cold cereal
in here

212
00:16:31,511 --> 00:16:33,366
and a Libby's
canned fruit,

213
00:16:33,431 --> 00:16:35,286
but she won't
eat the cherries.

214
00:16:35,352 --> 00:16:37,686
And beans-
She just loves beans.

215
00:16:37,753 --> 00:16:40,404
Frank, where's
our bags?

216
00:16:40,473 --> 00:16:42,808
It's the Love Boat
to Cuba.

217
00:16:42,874 --> 00:16:46,803
Shuffleboard and pineapples
filled with rum.

218
00:16:46,874 --> 00:16:48,401
You know what they do?

219
00:16:48,475 --> 00:16:51,290
They put paper umbrellas
sticking out the top,

220
00:16:51,355 --> 00:16:55,131
so when it rains,
it don't thin out the liquor.

221
00:16:55,196 --> 00:16:59,931
And here's her Enderol-
four times a day,

222
00:16:59,997 --> 00:17:01,852
after meals
and at bedtime,

223
00:17:01,917 --> 00:17:05,049
and her HydroDIURIL
twice a day

224
00:17:05,117 --> 00:17:06,491
and don't forget.

225
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:07,932
OK, I got it.

226
00:17:07,997 --> 00:17:10,649
I won't forget.
OK.

227
00:17:10,719 --> 00:17:14,494
Frank...
Frank, we're tired.

228
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:18,237
It's- it's not
home anymore.

229
00:17:18,304 --> 00:17:20,639
Say good-bye for us,
will you?

230
00:17:20,704 --> 00:17:23,771
Hell, she won't
even know you're gone.

231
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,175
Come on out, Faye.

232
00:17:57,241 --> 00:17:58,616
Let's do this.

233
00:17:58,681 --> 00:17:59,629
Where's Muriel?

234
00:17:59,705 --> 00:18:02,455
It smells like cherry cordial,
this stuff.

235
00:18:02,521 --> 00:18:03,732
Muriel!

236
00:18:03,802 --> 00:18:07,098
I'm Muriel now.
I'm comin' in, Faye.

237
00:18:07,162 --> 00:18:08,853
Hold it,
I ain't dressed.

238
00:18:08,923 --> 00:18:11,258
Get Frank.
Frank!

239
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:12,534
Yeah?

240
00:18:13,564 --> 00:18:14,774
Who's that?

241
00:18:15,804 --> 00:18:17,495
It's Frank.

242
00:18:17,565 --> 00:18:19,736
I'm Frank now.

243
00:18:19,804 --> 00:18:21,660
OK.

244
00:18:30,847 --> 00:18:32,702
Put on the red record.

245
00:18:32,767 --> 00:18:34,622
We haven't got
a red record.

246
00:18:34,687 --> 00:18:36,543
Muriel has
a red record.

247
00:18:36,608 --> 00:18:38,299
Makes the pills
go down.

248
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:39,262
Sure.

249
00:18:43,648 --> 00:18:48,057
- Say "ah. "
- No. Muriel and I say "frog. "

250
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:51,742
- Frog.
- OK, frog.

251
00:18:58,692 --> 00:19:00,863
Oh, my...

252
00:19:56,621 --> 00:19:59,436
I'm going to clean up
that cafe, Frank.

253
00:19:59,501 --> 00:20:02,317
I'm going to clean
it up right now.

254
00:20:03,342 --> 00:20:04,390
Oh.

255
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:07,438
Well...

256
00:20:07,503 --> 00:20:09,675
maybe first thing
in the morning.

257
00:20:09,744 --> 00:20:12,876
You don't have to
worry about a thing.

258
00:20:12,944 --> 00:20:14,951
OK?

259
00:20:15,024 --> 00:20:16,399
OK.

260
00:20:23,506 --> 00:20:26,157
# Just around
the corner #

261
00:20:26,227 --> 00:20:29,675
# There's a rainbow
in the sky #

262
00:20:29,747 --> 00:20:31,308
# So #

263
00:20:32,467 --> 00:20:35,283
# Let's have another
cup of coffee #

264
00:20:35,348 --> 00:20:38,480
# And let's have
another piece of pie ##

265
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:44,557
Did we miss the sunset?

266
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:46,960
Oh.

267
00:21:26,876 --> 00:21:27,924
Please...

268
00:21:29,438 --> 00:21:30,485
somebody...

269
00:21:32,158 --> 00:21:33,368
help us.

270
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:10,493
Frank.

271
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:13,075
Where's the goddamn
toaster?

272
00:28:48,795 --> 00:28:50,683
Good morning.
Island Manor.

273
00:28:51,867 --> 00:28:54,289
Can I help you?
Hello?

274
00:28:54,364 --> 00:28:55,793
Hello.

275
00:28:57,308 --> 00:28:58,355
Faye!

276
00:28:59,389 --> 00:29:01,396
Faye, what is this?

277
00:29:26,594 --> 00:29:29,311
Come on, Tommy,
slow down!

278
00:29:29,378 --> 00:29:31,134
Oh, no.

279
00:29:31,203 --> 00:29:33,886
Yo! Wait a minute!
Those are my pictures!

280
00:29:33,954 --> 00:29:35,646
Wait! Would you stop?

281
00:29:35,715 --> 00:29:37,122
Stop! Just wait!

282
00:29:37,187 --> 00:29:39,806
Oh, God.

283
00:29:39,876 --> 00:29:41,305
Today they collect
the garbage.

284
00:29:58,439 --> 00:29:59,814
- Hi.
- Hi.

285
00:29:59,879 --> 00:30:02,694
It's all right.
It's me- 3B.

286
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,575
Someone was in my room.

287
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,014
Yeah, me too.

288
00:30:07,081 --> 00:30:08,936
I think we got elves.

289
00:30:09,001 --> 00:30:10,856
- Good morning.
- Hi.

290
00:30:10,921 --> 00:30:12,296
Who are you?

291
00:30:12,361 --> 00:30:13,255
3C.

292
00:30:13,321 --> 00:30:15,176
Oh, the old
Grandey place.

293
00:30:15,242 --> 00:30:16,616
Have you seen my-

294
00:30:19,851 --> 00:30:21,891
Come on, dear.
Don't be shy.

295
00:30:21,963 --> 00:30:23,490
Oh, dear, come on.

296
00:30:23,563 --> 00:30:25,897
Let me get a nice,
big bolt for you.

297
00:30:25,964 --> 00:30:28,517
You're tired of nails.
Here.

298
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,650
You want some
paper clips?

299
00:30:31,725 --> 00:30:33,099
Come on.
Don't move.

300
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:35,653
Come on, Faye.
Time to go back downstairs.

301
00:30:35,725 --> 00:30:38,693
I'm feeding them.
They like this stuff.

302
00:30:38,766 --> 00:30:39,660
Here.

303
00:30:42,766 --> 00:30:44,905
Our son kept birds.

304
00:30:44,975 --> 00:30:47,528
You know, pigeons.

305
00:30:49,328 --> 00:30:51,816
Please, Faye.
Don't do this.

306
00:30:51,888 --> 00:30:53,743
Not now, OK?

307
00:30:55,889 --> 00:30:58,126
That's my frying pan.

308
00:30:59,313 --> 00:31:00,426
What?

309
00:31:00,498 --> 00:31:02,887
- Oh, nothing.
- Go ahead. Tell him.

310
00:31:02,962 --> 00:31:06,541
- Nothing. It's not important.
- That's her pan and my coffee pot.

311
00:31:08,147 --> 00:31:10,056
Come on. Come on.

312
00:31:11,731 --> 00:31:14,066
No more pigeons, hon.

313
00:31:14,132 --> 00:31:15,507
It's time to stop.

314
00:31:16,692 --> 00:31:18,864
I said stop that!

315
00:31:18,933 --> 00:31:19,827
Frank.

316
00:31:19,893 --> 00:31:21,104
My God, Faye.

317
00:31:21,173 --> 00:31:23,278
You went into these
people's apartments?

318
00:31:23,349 --> 00:31:25,684
Not me, them-
the little guys.

319
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:29,046
Faye, I need you
to be with me now.

320
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:31,215
I need you to be here.

321
00:31:31,286 --> 00:31:33,261
I'm here, Papa.
I'm with you.

322
00:31:33,335 --> 00:31:35,670
Now, what else
did you take?

323
00:31:35,735 --> 00:31:37,590
I told you, nothing.

324
00:31:37,656 --> 00:31:39,063
It's the little guys.

325
00:31:39,128 --> 00:31:40,622
Oh, skip that.

326
00:31:40,696 --> 00:31:42,071
What about this?

327
00:31:42,137 --> 00:31:44,406
Where did you get
a new picture?

328
00:31:44,473 --> 00:31:47,507
It's not new,
it- it's fixed.

329
00:31:47,578 --> 00:31:49,105
Fixed like new?

330
00:31:49,178 --> 00:31:51,033
They did
a good job.

331
00:31:51,098 --> 00:31:52,145
Who did?

332
00:31:53,178 --> 00:31:54,553
I ain't saying.

333
00:31:54,619 --> 00:31:55,513
Goddamn it-

334
00:31:55,579 --> 00:31:57,434
It's OK.
No harm done.

335
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,929
It could be
giant rats.

336
00:31:59,004 --> 00:32:00,859
Yeah, from Brooklyn,
you know.

337
00:32:04,221 --> 00:32:06,109
Oh!

338
00:32:07,261 --> 00:32:08,570
Whoa!

339
00:32:08,637 --> 00:32:09,750
That was no rat.

340
00:32:09,822 --> 00:32:11,066
What was it?

341
00:32:11,134 --> 00:32:13,622
Who in his right mind
stands in a puddle

342
00:32:13,694 --> 00:32:15,866
and sticks a fork
in a wall socket?

343
00:32:15,935 --> 00:32:18,750
Come on, get back.
All of you. Shoo!

344
00:32:18,815 --> 00:32:19,830
Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!

345
00:32:19,903 --> 00:32:21,910
Come on, now.

346
00:32:21,983 --> 00:32:24,155
There, wait there.
Wait there.

347
00:32:28,365 --> 00:32:29,412
Here.

348
00:32:30,606 --> 00:32:31,816
They're shy.

349
00:33:26,935 --> 00:33:28,310
They're the fix-its.

350
00:33:28,376 --> 00:33:30,231
They like
to fix things.

351
00:33:30,296 --> 00:33:32,304
They have that knack.

352
00:33:32,376 --> 00:33:35,191
Hey, dance me
around, Papa.

353
00:33:36,376 --> 00:33:38,232
Oh, come on,
you kids.

354
00:33:38,297 --> 00:33:41,112
Put a little
Fred Astaire into it.

355
00:34:28,002 --> 00:34:29,376
No, they're not toys.

356
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:31,581
You can't buy them
at Macy's.

357
00:34:31,651 --> 00:34:34,237
The Army told me
to call you.

358
00:34:34,307 --> 00:34:37,089
Are you
missing anything

359
00:34:37,156 --> 00:34:39,490
in the way of
experimental aircraft?

360
00:34:39,556 --> 00:34:42,142
Not a word,
not even in the Post.

361
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:43,587
Well, they're robots,
right?

362
00:34:43,652 --> 00:34:45,278
They're autogiros
or smart bombs.

363
00:34:45,348 --> 00:34:46,723
They're microchip
hovercraft.

364
00:34:46,789 --> 00:34:49,244
They're spaceships.
You can tell by lookin' at them.

365
00:34:49,317 --> 00:34:50,561
Spaceships?

366
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:53,827
Sure, from
a very small planet.

367
00:34:53,894 --> 00:34:55,650
Very small.

368
00:35:23,596 --> 00:35:25,767
Maybe this
is all a dream.

369
00:35:25,835 --> 00:35:29,698
If this is a dream,
which one of us is having it?

370
00:35:29,772 --> 00:35:31,146
Don't look at me.

371
00:35:31,213 --> 00:35:33,864
I stopped dreaming
a long time ago.

372
00:35:50,928 --> 00:35:52,303
I'll talk to it.

373
00:35:52,368 --> 00:35:53,742
You better be careful.

374
00:35:59,986 --> 00:36:01,230
Stop!

375
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:15,660
Welcome to America.

376
00:36:18,069 --> 00:36:20,917
Maybe you should try
some Spanish on him.

377
00:36:20,981 --> 00:36:23,021
Ahem.
Habla Espanol?

378
00:36:24,757 --> 00:36:26,318
Companeros.

379
00:36:28,183 --> 00:36:30,190
Don't hurt
anybody, OK?

380
00:36:31,255 --> 00:36:32,204
Breakfast.

381
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,721
Sit down, everybody.

382
00:36:36,792 --> 00:36:38,832
Don't let it get cold.

383
00:36:38,904 --> 00:36:40,944
I made candy omelets.

384
00:36:41,017 --> 00:36:43,189
That looks delicious,
Mrs. Riley.

385
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:49,264
Look. It's plugged itself in.

386
00:36:54,299 --> 00:36:57,616
Is that
why you're here?

387
00:37:05,981 --> 00:37:07,924
OK, that's it.

388
00:37:07,997 --> 00:37:10,998
I'll call the cops
and make them come.

389
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:12,444
I heard that.

390
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:15,325
You need cops, Picasso?
Come on. Call a cop.

391
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:17,725
- Bobby.
- Hey, lady, my name's not Bobby.

392
00:37:17,791 --> 00:37:19,165
Oh, excuse me.

393
00:37:19,231 --> 00:37:21,565
Robert. Mr. B.

394
00:37:21,632 --> 00:37:23,487
- Shut up!
- Hey!

395
00:37:23,552 --> 00:37:26,367
I saw downstairs.
Who's been cleaning up after me?

396
00:37:26,432 --> 00:37:28,473
Huh? Who?

397
00:37:31,617 --> 00:37:33,952
Whoever threw that
is ruined, man.

398
00:37:34,018 --> 00:37:35,545
Hospitalized.

399
00:38:04,391 --> 00:38:06,333
What the hell is this?

400
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:25,862
Whoever's in there,
you got big trouble, man.

401
00:38:38,893 --> 00:38:42,155
Uh, Carlos.

402
00:38:42,221 --> 00:38:44,393
Actually, I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

403
00:38:48,463 --> 00:38:49,772
Whoa!

404
00:38:52,175 --> 00:38:53,419
Ohh!

405
00:39:08,338 --> 00:39:10,225
Aah!

406
00:39:23,956 --> 00:39:27,732
Hey, Carlos, where are you going, man?
Let's talk this over!

407
00:39:27,797 --> 00:39:29,805
Don't forget to write!

408
00:39:35,574 --> 00:39:40,147
OK. Easy now, little guy.
That's right.

409
00:39:40,216 --> 00:39:43,086
I just want to check for that label
that says "Made in the U.S.A."

410
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,811
No, don't.
You'll queer our luck.

411
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:48,695
This little guy
is the golden goose.

412
00:39:57,774 --> 00:39:59,149
Wow.

413
00:40:01,678 --> 00:40:02,606
Aah!

414
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:08,200
It serves you right.

415
00:40:11,376 --> 00:40:14,191
We apologize.
He didn't mean to pry.

416
00:40:14,256 --> 00:40:16,111
He was just being...
scientific.

417
00:40:16,176 --> 00:40:18,381
"G.E."
This says "G.E."

418
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:21,766
This is- was-
my coffee pot.

419
00:40:21,841 --> 00:40:23,947
Looks like
it's been percolated.

420
00:40:24,018 --> 00:40:25,392
Who are they, Frank?

421
00:40:25,459 --> 00:40:28,274
What is so special
about our roof?

422
00:40:30,099 --> 00:40:31,725
Maybe it was me.

423
00:40:33,972 --> 00:40:35,947
What do you mean you?

424
00:40:37,556 --> 00:40:38,931
Me and Faye...

425
00:40:39,957 --> 00:40:42,226
we needed help.

426
00:40:42,294 --> 00:40:43,276
Oh, w-

427
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:47,245
You think that they're here
because of you?

428
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:51,890
The quickest way
to end a miracle

429
00:40:51,959 --> 00:40:55,188
is to ask it
why it is...

430
00:40:55,255 --> 00:40:57,776
or what it wants.

431
00:41:05,913 --> 00:41:07,604
What is
your name, dear?

432
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:11,122
- Marisa.
- Marisa. Boy, my memory.

433
00:41:11,195 --> 00:41:14,741
It's like the Navy-
coming and going, coming and going.

434
00:41:14,811 --> 00:41:17,266
Ah, here's Bobby's
little jammies.

435
00:41:17,339 --> 00:41:20,307
I bet there's even
a few diapers in here.

436
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:22,715
How old is your son, Mrs. Riley?

437
00:41:23,644 --> 00:41:24,724
Bobby?

438
00:41:25,757 --> 00:41:28,092
Uh, let me see.

439
00:41:28,157 --> 00:41:30,012
He just
had a birthday.

440
00:41:31,038 --> 00:41:33,274
I've got to think.

441
00:41:34,334 --> 00:41:37,881
He's got
his father's ears.

442
00:41:37,951 --> 00:41:42,326
He and Frank don't
get along so good.

443
00:41:42,399 --> 00:41:45,499
Frank's got a terrible temper,
you know.

444
00:41:49,249 --> 00:41:52,064
You're going to love
being a mother.

445
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:54,432
Faye, come here, quick!

446
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:47,073
- What are they doing?
- Can't you tell?

447
00:43:00,365 --> 00:43:02,220
She's going to get hungry.

448
00:43:03,405 --> 00:43:04,999
Take it away!

449
00:43:14,127 --> 00:43:16,332
It's too short!

450
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,342
- Any more?
- That's it.

451
00:43:18,416 --> 00:43:20,653
Come on, Frank.
They're starving.

452
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,292
Well, what do you know?

453
00:43:25,362 --> 00:43:27,304
Thanks, Harry.

454
00:43:27,378 --> 00:43:29,320
I saw you fight.

455
00:43:29,394 --> 00:43:32,810
Harry Noble,
the human locomotive.

456
00:43:32,883 --> 00:43:34,955
Come on, Harry,
say something.

457
00:43:35,027 --> 00:43:36,588
Talk to me.

458
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:41,166
Come on, Frank.
Get on with it.

459
00:43:41,236 --> 00:43:43,211
A tremendous right.

460
00:43:43,284 --> 00:43:44,943
Tremendous.

461
00:43:45,013 --> 00:43:46,387
Never says a word.

462
00:43:46,453 --> 00:43:49,999
Just watches TV.
Loves the commercials.

463
00:43:52,278 --> 00:43:54,285
It's all we got.

464
00:43:56,023 --> 00:43:58,609
Come on. Take it.

465
00:43:58,679 --> 00:44:01,908
It's OK.
We're neighbors.

466
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:07,252
- Doesn't trust us.
- Yeah.

467
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:34,011
Harry Noble.
I used to bet on him.

468
00:44:34,077 --> 00:44:37,078
He had a hell of a right.
You should've seen him.

469
00:44:57,249 --> 00:45:01,111
Look out. Flying pot.

470
00:45:01,186 --> 00:45:03,740
Ghost in the garbage!

471
00:45:03,811 --> 00:45:05,185
Shut up, Benny.

472
00:45:05,250 --> 00:45:09,408
Mama's whole kitchen
coming to get you.

473
00:45:09,476 --> 00:45:11,385
I said shut up, man!

474
00:45:12,419 --> 00:45:13,794
Hey, lighten up.

475
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:14,754
Hey.

476
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:17,155
We got plans
for those people.

477
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:19,293
And you know what?

478
00:45:19,365 --> 00:45:23,043
Those people are
making plans on their own.

479
00:45:23,110 --> 00:45:25,860
They got something hooked up.

480
00:45:25,926 --> 00:45:28,993
Man, they're getting organized,
and look at us.

481
00:45:30,887 --> 00:45:32,262
Somebody's helping them.

482
00:45:32,327 --> 00:45:35,393
Somebody's bringing
them together.

483
00:45:35,463 --> 00:45:38,279
- Yo, Carlos, I see someone.
- Give me that!

484
00:45:47,081 --> 00:45:48,838
Wave to your mother.

485
00:46:05,037 --> 00:46:06,760
Ah, there you are.

486
00:46:07,853 --> 00:46:11,399
You're a lucky one.
She's a darling girl.

487
00:46:32,434 --> 00:46:34,409
Are you superstitious?

488
00:46:34,481 --> 00:46:36,554
I'm getting there.

489
00:46:36,626 --> 00:46:37,936
Well...

490
00:46:39,955 --> 00:46:41,962
I'm not superstitious...

491
00:46:42,995 --> 00:46:45,811
but I was thinking
about these things

492
00:46:45,876 --> 00:46:47,250
and why they came.

493
00:46:47,316 --> 00:46:48,210
Uh-huh.

494
00:46:48,276 --> 00:46:50,349
And, uh...

495
00:46:51,668 --> 00:46:53,524
This will really
sound silly,

496
00:46:53,589 --> 00:46:56,721
but it's like they were
watching or listening.

497
00:46:57,877 --> 00:47:00,463
And you think they're here
because of you.

498
00:47:00,534 --> 00:47:01,549
Yes!

499
00:47:06,231 --> 00:47:08,086
So when's the baby due?

500
00:47:08,151 --> 00:47:10,803
Two or three more months.
I'm not sure.

501
00:47:10,872 --> 00:47:12,912
You're not sure?
What does the doctor say?

502
00:47:12,985 --> 00:47:15,571
- I haven't been to the doctor.
- That's crazy.

503
00:47:15,641 --> 00:47:17,878
- I feel fine.
- You got to take care of yourself.

504
00:47:17,945 --> 00:47:21,361
My boyfriend's coming.
He's gonna take care of me.

505
00:47:21,434 --> 00:47:24,184
- Oh, your boyfriend.
- Hector. He's a musician,

506
00:47:24,251 --> 00:47:26,161
so he travels around a lot,

507
00:47:26,234 --> 00:47:28,209
different places.

508
00:47:28,283 --> 00:47:31,829
So, what about you?
No more girlfriend?

509
00:47:31,899 --> 00:47:34,486
No, she got smart.

510
00:47:34,556 --> 00:47:37,372
Don't say that.
She'll be back.

511
00:47:37,437 --> 00:47:40,187
- Yeah? Why should she?
- Because.

512
00:47:40,253 --> 00:47:41,951
You're an artist.

513
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:45,462
Oh, God, an artist.

514
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:49,815
- Can I come in?
- No.

515
00:47:49,888 --> 00:47:52,158
I make a very artistic
cup of coffee.

516
00:47:52,224 --> 00:47:53,468
No, um...

517
00:47:53,536 --> 00:47:56,352
I want to go to bed-
to sleep.

518
00:47:56,417 --> 00:47:58,752
I have to take a nap.

519
00:48:01,315 --> 00:48:03,770
Did I say something wrong?

520
00:48:03,843 --> 00:48:06,462
No, it was nice
talking to you.

521
00:48:06,531 --> 00:48:08,702
I'll see you tomorrow, OK?

522
00:48:08,771 --> 00:48:09,786
OK.

523
00:48:11,044 --> 00:48:12,124
Tomorrow.

524
00:48:15,717 --> 00:48:17,343
Mason?

525
00:48:18,693 --> 00:48:21,028
Maybe it was for you.

526
00:48:21,093 --> 00:48:22,523
What?

527
00:48:22,597 --> 00:48:25,347
Maybe they're here,
those things,

528
00:48:25,415 --> 00:48:27,487
because of you.

529
00:48:39,176 --> 00:48:40,551
Give me back
my camera, man.

530
00:48:40,617 --> 00:48:42,472
Unexplained phenomena, man.

531
00:48:42,537 --> 00:48:43,431
Bust it up, Benny!

532
00:48:43,497 --> 00:48:45,353
Want to do business?
Severance pay.

533
00:48:45,418 --> 00:48:48,386
Wanna see
a strange object?

534
00:48:49,738 --> 00:48:51,113
There you go, fool!

535
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:14,790
Frank!

536
00:49:16,143 --> 00:49:17,518
Frank!

537
00:49:20,688 --> 00:49:21,703
Aah!

538
00:49:21,776 --> 00:49:23,816
What's happening?

539
00:49:30,610 --> 00:49:31,984
Tonight's the night.

540
00:49:32,050 --> 00:49:33,959
- Already?
- Uh-huh.

541
00:49:52,213 --> 00:49:54,963
The fuses!
She blew the fuses.

542
00:50:04,695 --> 00:50:06,070
There it is!

543
00:50:14,457 --> 00:50:15,351
Ooh!

544
00:50:39,742 --> 00:50:41,116
How's she doing?

545
00:50:41,182 --> 00:50:42,556
It happened.

546
00:50:43,742 --> 00:50:45,433
I'm a grandmother.

547
00:51:00,865 --> 00:51:02,524
It's twins!

548
00:51:02,593 --> 00:51:04,633
This calls for cigars.

549
00:51:05,666 --> 00:51:08,001
- You got any cigars?
- Cigars?

550
00:51:08,066 --> 00:51:09,441
This is history!

551
00:51:10,947 --> 00:51:14,242
D- Do you realize
what's going on here?

552
00:51:14,308 --> 00:51:17,123
Machines
that reproduce themselves!

553
00:51:18,148 --> 00:51:20,003
Spare parts
with intelligence!

554
00:51:20,069 --> 00:51:22,240
Living hardware!

555
00:51:25,349 --> 00:51:28,164
I- I don't know
how you got here,

556
00:51:28,230 --> 00:51:30,564
or why you picked us,

557
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:33,947
but... we pledge allegiance

558
00:51:34,022 --> 00:51:36,805
to honor and protect you...

559
00:51:39,527 --> 00:51:41,382
in sickness and in health...

560
00:51:41,447 --> 00:51:43,303
in rain and sleet...

561
00:51:43,368 --> 00:51:46,019
in the best of times
and the worst of times...

562
00:51:46,089 --> 00:51:48,424
and, w-we...
so help us, God!

563
00:51:48,489 --> 00:51:50,344
Shh!
What's that?

564
00:52:17,774 --> 00:52:20,426
Batteries not included.

565
00:52:50,644 --> 00:52:53,939
The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want.

566
00:52:54,005 --> 00:52:56,820
He leadeth me
beside the still waters.

567
00:52:56,885 --> 00:52:58,030
Faye...

568
00:52:58,101 --> 00:53:01,648
Faye, this has gone far enough.
Come on. Get up.

569
00:53:01,718 --> 00:53:03,790
Got to accept it, Frank.
It's over.

570
00:53:03,862 --> 00:53:05,237
Poor little soul.

571
00:53:05,302 --> 00:53:09,264
What soul? What soul?
Mrs. Riley, Mrs. Riley-

572
00:53:09,335 --> 00:53:11,244
Mrs. Riley,
it's a chunk of metal.

573
00:53:11,319 --> 00:53:14,320
It's nine ounces of canned goods,
most of it from your apartment.

574
00:53:14,392 --> 00:53:15,799
Now we can
really look inside-

575
00:53:15,864 --> 00:53:18,996
Wait a minute.
Last night you were so excited.

576
00:53:19,065 --> 00:53:20,592
Now they're chunks of metal?

577
00:53:20,665 --> 00:53:23,731
You don't bury the most advanced,
self-perpetuating,

578
00:53:23,801 --> 00:53:26,671
machine-tooled,
flying clockwork known to man!

579
00:53:26,746 --> 00:53:28,273
Mrs. Riley, please!

580
00:53:28,346 --> 00:53:33,049
You know, that little tiny,
helpless spare part-

581
00:53:33,115 --> 00:53:35,767
It got born,
and it never had a chance.

582
00:53:35,836 --> 00:53:37,592
It could happen to anyone.

583
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:39,253
What's the matter with you?

584
00:53:39,324 --> 00:53:41,659
What did I say?

585
00:53:41,724 --> 00:53:43,634
Marisa.
Marisa, wait a minute!

586
00:53:50,590 --> 00:53:52,925
Hey! Whatcha doing?

587
00:53:55,551 --> 00:53:56,926
Marisa, wait a minute!

588
00:53:56,991 --> 00:53:59,479
Wait up!
Would you stop?

589
00:53:59,552 --> 00:54:02,367
- Wait a minute!
- I'm worried about the baby, OK?

590
00:54:02,432 --> 00:54:06,208
I can't help it, but don't let it
bother you. It's not your problem.

591
00:54:06,273 --> 00:54:07,167
Harry?

592
00:54:07,233 --> 00:54:08,608
Where are you going?

593
00:54:08,673 --> 00:54:09,567
Stop him!

594
00:54:09,633 --> 00:54:11,488
Oh, God, what is it?

595
00:54:11,554 --> 00:54:13,179
Harry, wait a minute!

596
00:54:16,163 --> 00:54:17,057
Harry!

597
00:54:19,715 --> 00:54:21,090
Harry, please!

598
00:54:23,236 --> 00:54:26,051
Ahh!
Champ, what are you doing?

599
00:54:26,116 --> 00:54:28,451
Come on, open up.

600
00:54:28,516 --> 00:54:31,299
Let's talk about this.
You don't have to say anything.

601
00:54:31,365 --> 00:54:34,268
I'll do all the talking.
What are you gonna do with that?

602
00:54:54,281 --> 00:54:56,224
Gary, Glen.

603
00:54:56,298 --> 00:54:58,818
Uh, smells good, Pop.
You back in business?

604
00:55:00,522 --> 00:55:02,377
What's it look like?

605
00:55:23,905 --> 00:55:26,872
Ham san, Miracle Whip,
Canadian on the side.

606
00:55:26,944 --> 00:55:28,799
Steak medium rare!

607
00:55:28,865 --> 00:55:33,121
Two over easy, English,
no toast, and hold the spuds.

608
00:55:33,186 --> 00:55:35,521
Burger up.

609
00:55:37,506 --> 00:55:39,841
Boy, I'm sure going to hate
to crunch this place up.

610
00:55:39,907 --> 00:55:41,216
Oh, thank you, ma'am.

611
00:55:41,283 --> 00:55:43,673
What's this,
April fool?

612
00:55:51,429 --> 00:55:52,956
He's working on it.

613
00:55:53,029 --> 00:55:55,134
It's his first day, OK?

614
00:55:57,446 --> 00:56:01,058
Hey, pal...

615
00:56:01,127 --> 00:56:02,720
like this.

616
00:56:02,791 --> 00:56:04,417
Remember?

617
00:56:21,130 --> 00:56:22,504
Burger up.

618
00:56:27,851 --> 00:56:29,826
Now, that's more like it.

619
00:56:34,093 --> 00:56:35,467
Look at this!

620
00:56:35,532 --> 00:56:37,867
Lefty, hey!
Give me that ketchup.

621
00:56:37,933 --> 00:56:39,788
- This one?
- No, the other one.

622
00:56:39,854 --> 00:56:42,188
Oh, yeah, here you go.

623
00:56:42,253 --> 00:56:43,366
Thanks.

624
00:56:52,336 --> 00:56:53,383
What?

625
00:56:54,415 --> 00:56:56,587
What do you mean, "what"?

626
00:57:21,620 --> 00:57:23,955
Hey, Frank.
Guess what I did.

627
00:57:24,021 --> 00:57:27,317
- What now?
- I named the little guys.

628
00:57:27,381 --> 00:57:29,236
Flotsam and Jetsam!
Isn't that cute?

629
00:57:29,302 --> 00:57:30,676
Yeah, cute.

630
00:57:30,742 --> 00:57:32,117
Be nice, Papa.

631
00:57:32,182 --> 00:57:34,190
I'm always nice.
I've got a kitchen to run.

632
00:57:34,263 --> 00:57:36,685
If you're not nice,
you'll drive them away.

633
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:39,411
Meaning what?

634
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:41,389
I like being a family again.

635
00:57:41,463 --> 00:57:43,438
Just you and me
and Flotsam and Jetsam

636
00:57:43,512 --> 00:57:45,400
and... and Bobby.

637
00:57:51,385 --> 00:57:52,912
OK, Faye.

638
00:57:54,906 --> 00:57:56,116
OK.

639
00:58:29,248 --> 00:58:30,710
- Oh.
- Carlos.

640
00:58:30,785 --> 00:58:33,022
Is this what
you're talking about?

641
00:58:33,089 --> 00:58:35,162
It's full of junk.
It's a storage shed, you idiot.

642
00:58:35,233 --> 00:58:36,607
No, it's not.

643
00:58:36,673 --> 00:58:38,845
It's full of ghosts
or spirits or something.

644
00:58:38,914 --> 00:58:41,697
They're just trying
to make me look bad.

645
00:58:41,762 --> 00:58:44,730
You don't need ghosts
for that, Carlos.

646
00:58:44,803 --> 00:58:47,007
Your time's running out,
my friend.

647
00:58:53,156 --> 00:58:57,347
Hey, I'm hungry. How about
a little service around here.

648
00:58:57,413 --> 00:59:00,545
What's great about a place
you can't even get a menu?

649
00:59:00,613 --> 00:59:02,206
You want a menu, pal?

650
00:59:02,277 --> 00:59:05,060
What for? You're gonna get
the special of the day.

651
00:59:05,126 --> 00:59:08,356
Man, you shouldn't even be in here.
I'm gonna report all you guys.

652
00:59:08,423 --> 00:59:10,790
Bobby, have you had
your lunch?

653
00:59:10,856 --> 00:59:13,125
Wait a minute.
Excuse me.

654
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:16,742
There.

655
00:59:16,808 --> 00:59:19,492
Now, what about you?
You want to sleep over?

656
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:22,496
Why don't you call your mommy
and tell her where you'll be.

657
00:59:22,569 --> 00:59:25,385
No thanks, Mrs. Riley.
I can't tonight.

658
00:59:25,450 --> 00:59:28,200
Bobby, you want
to go out and play?

659
00:59:28,266 --> 00:59:31,081
You ain't going nowhere
unless you eat something.

660
00:59:31,147 --> 00:59:33,219
You look terrible.
Thin. Here.

661
00:59:33,291 --> 00:59:37,416
- Come on, lady. You gotta stop this.
- Eat, for the love of Mike.

662
00:59:37,484 --> 00:59:39,339
You're just like your father.

663
00:59:39,404 --> 00:59:42,569
I don't know nothing about my father,
and I don't wanna know.

664
00:59:42,637 --> 00:59:45,539
Don't say that. He loves you.

665
00:59:47,213 --> 00:59:50,247
Lady, I'm not
who you think I am.

666
00:59:50,318 --> 00:59:52,261
Of course you are,
my little munchkin.

667
00:59:52,334 --> 00:59:54,637
I'm learning how Lacey works,
how this city works.

668
00:59:54,703 --> 00:59:57,638
- It's my way out of here.
- Where are you going?

669
00:59:57,711 --> 00:59:59,140
Anywhere.

670
00:59:59,216 --> 01:00:02,828
I'm smart, I'm talented.

671
01:00:02,896 --> 01:00:05,897
- I get ideas all the time.
- Of course you do.

672
01:00:05,969 --> 01:00:09,614
Why don't you talk to your father
tonight at dinner?

673
01:00:12,050 --> 01:00:13,708
I'll cook a ham.

674
01:00:13,778 --> 01:00:15,753
You're inviting me
for dinner?

675
01:00:15,826 --> 01:00:17,420
You'd love my ham.

676
01:00:18,675 --> 01:00:21,578
Oh, my goodness,
is that a smile?

677
01:00:23,412 --> 01:00:26,162
I think I just saw a smile.

678
01:00:30,165 --> 01:00:33,460
Oh, not here, honey.
Back inside on the counter.

679
01:00:33,526 --> 01:00:34,933
What the hell is that?

680
01:00:34,998 --> 01:00:37,300
It's them. The little guys.

681
01:00:37,366 --> 01:00:38,893
My little munchkins.

682
01:00:38,966 --> 01:00:40,341
Stay away from me.

683
01:00:40,407 --> 01:00:42,447
You're not fooling anybody.

684
01:00:42,519 --> 01:00:44,112
Crazy, my ass.

685
01:02:10,476 --> 01:02:13,543
Marisa, open up.

686
01:02:16,621 --> 01:02:18,028
Hi.

687
01:02:18,094 --> 01:02:20,363
Listen, you are going
to stop worrying

688
01:02:20,430 --> 01:02:21,859
about that baby.

689
01:02:21,934 --> 01:02:23,276
Step aside.

690
01:02:28,111 --> 01:02:29,005
Whole wheat bread.

691
01:02:29,072 --> 01:02:32,782
Lots of milk.
We've got whole milk,

692
01:02:32,848 --> 01:02:36,078
half fat, non-fat.
One baby book.

693
01:02:36,145 --> 01:02:38,666
What are you doing?
You don't have to take care of me.

694
01:02:38,737 --> 01:02:42,349
I got you these
for that special yen.

695
01:02:43,506 --> 01:02:45,743
Mm-mmm.

696
01:02:45,810 --> 01:02:48,298
Oh. Oh.

697
01:03:02,773 --> 01:03:05,589
You made me
an art collector.

698
01:03:05,654 --> 01:03:08,371
He's, uh, a new guy,
very talented.

699
01:03:11,990 --> 01:03:14,325
What's this one
say to you?

700
01:03:14,391 --> 01:03:16,781
That's my favorite.

701
01:03:18,455 --> 01:03:22,799
It's, um, it's a guy
standing in the sun.

702
01:03:22,873 --> 01:03:26,517
- Sun? What sun? There's no sun.
- Oh, yes, there is.

703
01:03:26,585 --> 01:03:29,455
See, all you see now
is the shadows.

704
01:03:29,529 --> 01:03:31,897
See, if he moves
two steps in any direction,

705
01:03:31,962 --> 01:03:33,817
he'll be in the sunlight.

706
01:03:33,882 --> 01:03:37,461
I've been looking at it a lot,
you know, because it's art.

707
01:03:37,531 --> 01:03:39,866
You got to keep
looking at it.

708
01:03:41,307 --> 01:03:45,018
What?
What are you staring at?

709
01:03:52,702 --> 01:03:54,011
He's on his way.

710
01:04:09,921 --> 01:04:13,304
- Carlos?
- Yo, Mr. Kovacs.

711
01:04:13,378 --> 01:04:14,807
Carlos, what are you
doing here?

712
01:04:14,882 --> 01:04:16,540
I want one more chance.

713
01:04:16,610 --> 01:04:18,520
I got to have this job,
you understand?

714
01:04:18,594 --> 01:04:20,416
You've been happy
up till now, right?

715
01:04:20,482 --> 01:04:21,376
Mr. Lacey.

716
01:04:21,443 --> 01:04:22,752
This is, uh...

717
01:04:22,819 --> 01:04:24,226
I know who he is.

718
01:04:24,291 --> 01:04:27,587
Mr. Lacey.
I gave them the money.

719
01:04:27,652 --> 01:04:29,856
And they sent it
right back.

720
01:04:29,924 --> 01:04:31,353
Come here.

721
01:04:34,533 --> 01:04:38,308
I got a commitment to have
this entire block down to grade level.

722
01:04:42,566 --> 01:04:43,941
Grade level. Comprende?

723
01:04:44,006 --> 01:04:45,632
I can do it, sir.

724
01:04:45,703 --> 01:04:47,710
There's no problem,
I assure you.

725
01:04:47,783 --> 01:04:51,166
In three days, permits expire
and legal options go out the window.

726
01:04:51,239 --> 01:04:54,720
- I know about options, lot assemblies-
- Interest rates are going back up,

727
01:04:54,792 --> 01:04:56,451
and I'm paying a demolition crew

728
01:04:56,521 --> 01:04:59,718
to sit around in a restaurant
they're supposed to be knocking down.

729
01:04:59,785 --> 01:05:02,174
Tonight.
I'll have them out by tonight.

730
01:05:02,249 --> 01:05:04,900
You've had your chance, kid.
I've made other arrangements.

731
01:05:11,563 --> 01:05:14,531
Don't you worry, Mr. Lacey.
I'm gonna do it for you.

732
01:05:32,047 --> 01:05:34,349
What?
What's so funny?

733
01:05:34,415 --> 01:05:37,580
You. Your face.
You look so serious.

734
01:05:37,648 --> 01:05:40,365
Well, this is serious.

735
01:05:40,432 --> 01:05:42,986
I'm looking at the real you.

736
01:05:43,057 --> 01:05:45,097
And what do you see?

737
01:05:45,169 --> 01:05:48,912
What do I see?
I see a mysterious counterplay

738
01:05:48,978 --> 01:05:50,833
of light and dark.

739
01:05:52,754 --> 01:05:55,176
Hey! All right, great.

740
01:05:55,251 --> 01:05:56,528
Give me that pen.

741
01:05:56,595 --> 01:05:58,384
Those aren't toys, you guys.

742
01:05:58,451 --> 01:06:02,096
Put that down. You guys, come on.
Stop playing with that.

743
01:06:02,164 --> 01:06:03,539
Oh, my God!

744
01:06:03,604 --> 01:06:05,993
That's not fair.

745
01:06:06,069 --> 01:06:08,884
What's not fair about it?
I used my imagination, that's all.

746
01:06:08,949 --> 01:06:10,095
And my
X- ray goggles.

747
01:06:10,165 --> 01:06:12,532
Hey, would you paint
some clothes on her?

748
01:06:13,750 --> 01:06:15,693
Hey!

749
01:06:22,007 --> 01:06:23,218
Oye, Marisa!

750
01:06:23,288 --> 01:06:24,662
Vamos a posar.

751
01:06:24,727 --> 01:06:27,062
Vamos a posar. Hey!

752
01:06:27,128 --> 01:06:29,365
Vamos a posar.

753
01:06:32,121 --> 01:06:33,495
Hector.

754
01:06:36,922 --> 01:06:38,034
Hector.

755
01:06:46,492 --> 01:06:47,419
Hector.

756
01:07:26,946 --> 01:07:27,895
Thanks.

757
01:07:39,012 --> 01:07:42,111
Whatever happened
to General Eisenhower?

758
01:07:42,181 --> 01:07:44,997
You hardly see a word
about him anymore.

759
01:09:11,221 --> 01:09:12,497
Ohh.

760
01:09:18,198 --> 01:09:19,758
It's the little fella,

761
01:09:19,829 --> 01:09:22,132
alive and kicking.

762
01:09:41,554 --> 01:09:43,212
Harry.

763
01:09:43,281 --> 01:09:44,656
You did that?

764
01:09:46,386 --> 01:09:48,721
We bring good things to life.

765
01:10:12,119 --> 01:10:15,468
You know what happens
when birds learn to fly.

766
01:10:15,543 --> 01:10:18,610
They leave the nest!

767
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:19,727
Waaa!

768
01:10:43,611 --> 01:10:45,270
Marisa?

769
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:09,368
Carlos, you
semi-illiterate,

770
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:11,164
fascist sociopath!

771
01:11:13,024 --> 01:11:15,894
You were gone so long,
I was leaving you a note.

772
01:11:21,538 --> 01:11:23,994
- "Dear Mason-"
- Not out loud.

773
01:11:24,067 --> 01:11:26,107
That's all it says.

774
01:11:26,179 --> 01:11:28,067
Well, I didn't know
what to write.

775
01:11:29,828 --> 01:11:31,770
What are you doing
with my paintings?

776
01:11:31,844 --> 01:11:34,844
Oh, your paintings.
Just because you go-

777
01:11:34,916 --> 01:11:37,535
Where's Hector
and the all-stars?

778
01:11:37,605 --> 01:11:40,802
Um... they're on
their way to Chicago.

779
01:11:40,869 --> 01:11:42,724
Oh, that son of a bitch.

780
01:11:42,790 --> 01:11:44,732
Look, he got a good job.

781
01:11:44,807 --> 01:11:46,181
It's good pay.

782
01:11:46,246 --> 01:11:47,621
It's a break, really.

783
01:11:47,687 --> 01:11:49,116
But what about you?

784
01:11:49,191 --> 01:11:50,653
I, um...

785
01:11:52,936 --> 01:11:54,944
I told him to go.

786
01:12:00,937 --> 01:12:03,752
Well, you need somebody
to draw, right?

787
01:13:47,611 --> 01:13:49,204
Can you believe this?

788
01:13:50,556 --> 01:13:52,890
I got it. I got it.

789
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:56,603
This must be Carlos.

790
01:13:56,669 --> 01:13:58,808
No, don't kid yourself.

791
01:13:58,878 --> 01:14:00,252
This isn't Carlos.

792
01:14:00,318 --> 01:14:01,692
This is Lacey.

793
01:14:47,493 --> 01:14:48,508
Carlos!

794
01:14:48,582 --> 01:14:50,884
You murdering
son of a bitch!

795
01:14:50,950 --> 01:14:52,958
Get out of my way.

796
01:14:53,031 --> 01:14:55,365
Not this time, pal.

797
01:14:58,280 --> 01:15:01,793
- My guys are coming any minute.
- Yeah, sure they are.

798
01:15:06,377 --> 01:15:08,679
Aah!

799
01:15:24,620 --> 01:15:26,214
What's this?

800
01:15:26,284 --> 01:15:28,424
Everybody together?

801
01:15:28,493 --> 01:15:30,533
What, you ganging up on me?

802
01:15:41,231 --> 01:15:43,086
Oh, yeah? Come on.

803
01:15:43,151 --> 01:15:44,493
Come on!

804
01:15:48,881 --> 01:15:50,921
You should stay retired, champ.

805
01:16:08,115 --> 01:16:10,058
Stop them, Frank. Stop them!

806
01:16:10,132 --> 01:16:12,271
I'll take door number one.

807
01:16:16,085 --> 01:16:19,764
Bobby!

808
01:16:19,829 --> 01:16:22,034
Goddamn it,
he's not Bobby.

809
01:16:22,102 --> 01:16:23,476
He's just a punk.

810
01:16:23,542 --> 01:16:25,397
- Let me go. He's hurt.
- Faye-

811
01:16:25,463 --> 01:16:26,957
- What's the matter with you?
- Faye-

812
01:16:27,031 --> 01:16:30,709
- Bobby is dead. He's dead. You hear?
- No!

813
01:16:32,504 --> 01:16:34,479
You wish he was dead.

814
01:16:35,864 --> 01:16:37,206
Faye.

815
01:16:37,272 --> 01:16:40,589
All you do is yell at him
and make him feel he's not good enough.

816
01:16:40,665 --> 01:16:42,575
Well, look who's talking.

817
01:16:42,650 --> 01:16:45,618
Why do you think he's buying that car?
To get away from you!

818
01:16:45,690 --> 01:16:47,862
We're gonna lose him,
and it's all your fault.

819
01:16:47,930 --> 01:16:50,320
You hate him!

820
01:17:05,886 --> 01:17:06,780
Flotsam!

821
01:17:06,846 --> 01:17:07,740
Jetsam.

822
01:17:08,766 --> 01:17:10,260
Flotsam.

823
01:17:10,334 --> 01:17:12,157
Jetsam.

824
01:17:12,223 --> 01:17:14,427
Come on out.

825
01:17:14,495 --> 01:17:16,201
Don't hide.

826
01:17:16,328 --> 01:17:17,889
- No one's going to hurt you.
- It'll be OK.

827
01:17:17,961 --> 01:17:18,855
Flotsam.

828
01:17:18,921 --> 01:17:19,815
Jetsam.

829
01:17:19,881 --> 01:17:22,697
- She's scared.
- Come on, you guys.

830
01:17:22,762 --> 01:17:27,400
- Where are you hiding?
- Mason, I'm up here.

831
01:18:04,817 --> 01:18:07,501
What about Times Square,
all the electricity?

832
01:18:07,569 --> 01:18:09,031
Or the subway?

833
01:18:23,604 --> 01:18:24,848
Now what?

834
01:18:24,916 --> 01:18:26,859
Now we go home.

835
01:18:26,933 --> 01:18:29,388
It's over.

836
01:18:29,461 --> 01:18:31,316
Harry, what are you doing?

837
01:18:31,381 --> 01:18:34,960
Harry, what the hell
are you doing?

838
01:18:35,030 --> 01:18:36,013
Harry!

839
01:20:10,054 --> 01:20:12,421
What in the name of God?

840
01:21:56,024 --> 01:21:57,268
OK.

841
01:21:57,337 --> 01:21:58,767
Go now.

842
01:21:58,841 --> 01:22:01,111
Go find your babies.

843
01:22:28,415 --> 01:22:31,993
You are a genius, Harry.
One hundred percent.

844
01:22:32,063 --> 01:22:34,551
Don't leave home without it.

845
01:22:56,259 --> 01:22:58,082
He's back together.

846
01:23:12,646 --> 01:23:15,646
Mason, do something.
Talk to them.

847
01:23:15,718 --> 01:23:17,857
What should I say?
It was an accident?

848
01:23:17,927 --> 01:23:19,553
We didn't do anything.

849
01:23:19,623 --> 01:23:21,314
It was Carlos.

850
01:23:27,529 --> 01:23:30,496
Wait!
Give us another chance!

851
01:23:41,515 --> 01:23:42,759
Harry.

852
01:23:44,203 --> 01:23:46,473
Let him go, Harry.

853
01:23:55,917 --> 01:23:58,023
Let him go.

854
01:24:18,001 --> 01:24:19,856
What the hell you doing?

855
01:24:19,921 --> 01:24:22,737
What, are you having
a party or what?

856
01:24:22,802 --> 01:24:25,617
No party, kid.
There's no one home.

857
01:24:25,682 --> 01:24:27,057
That's 'cause of me.

858
01:24:27,123 --> 01:24:30,419
They won't stay if there's
no water and electricity.

859
01:24:30,483 --> 01:24:32,338
What are you doing here?

860
01:24:32,404 --> 01:24:34,640
This is my building.
I did the job. I cleared it.

861
01:24:36,725 --> 01:24:38,798
You're going to
burn the place down.

862
01:24:38,869 --> 01:24:41,935
Man, that's bullshit. This is
my building, man. They're movin' out.

863
01:24:42,005 --> 01:24:44,820
Look, what do you want from me?
It's too late, all right?

864
01:24:44,886 --> 01:24:46,260
What about me?

865
01:24:46,326 --> 01:24:48,661
What about you?

866
01:24:48,726 --> 01:24:51,826
OK. If it's got
to burn down...

867
01:24:52,855 --> 01:24:54,895
I'm going to burn it.

868
01:24:54,968 --> 01:24:58,580
Hey, what are you-
You schmuck, that's evidence.

869
01:24:58,648 --> 01:25:00,110
Ohh.

870
01:25:01,752 --> 01:25:04,097
It's got to look normal.

871
01:25:04,167 --> 01:25:05,115
Regular!

872
01:25:05,191 --> 01:25:07,974
Who cares?
We're burning the place, right?

873
01:25:08,039 --> 01:25:09,414
Let's burn it.

874
01:25:21,322 --> 01:25:22,817
Sloppy.

875
01:25:22,890 --> 01:25:24,679
I hate sloppy.

876
01:25:24,746 --> 01:25:26,372
Don't you want to see?

877
01:25:26,442 --> 01:25:29,509
When you do good work,
don't you like to watch it?

878
01:25:29,579 --> 01:25:32,362
What do you want?
We should be across town by now.

879
01:25:32,428 --> 01:25:34,316
Bobby, you let him go

880
01:25:34,380 --> 01:25:37,097
and get up here this instant.

881
01:25:38,637 --> 01:25:40,971
You said the place was empty.

882
01:25:41,037 --> 01:25:43,852
You got to shut it off, man.

883
01:25:43,917 --> 01:25:45,772
Too late.
It's too late.

884
01:25:45,837 --> 01:25:49,766
Want to get us both killed?
It's gonna blow any minute!

885
01:25:49,838 --> 01:25:52,621
Just get in there.
Get in there!

886
01:26:00,208 --> 01:26:03,504
My leg! My knee!
You broke my knee!

887
01:26:03,569 --> 01:26:04,944
That's bull, man.

888
01:26:05,009 --> 01:26:07,344
Get up. Get up!

889
01:26:07,410 --> 01:26:09,134
I can't walk.

890
01:26:09,202 --> 01:26:11,057
I'll tell you where it is.

891
01:26:11,122 --> 01:26:13,544
Fourth floor,
storeroom, in back.

892
01:26:13,619 --> 01:26:14,994
Where?

893
01:26:15,059 --> 01:26:16,914
The storeroom.

894
01:26:16,979 --> 01:26:19,532
Now, go!
You got two minutes.

895
01:26:30,934 --> 01:26:32,756
Lady, come on!

896
01:26:32,822 --> 01:26:34,197
All right, all right.

897
01:26:34,262 --> 01:26:36,117
Supper's nearly ready.

898
01:26:38,007 --> 01:26:40,909
Go wash your hands and face
and go sit down at the table.

899
01:26:40,983 --> 01:26:43,831
See, I knew you'd be coming.

900
01:26:43,896 --> 01:26:45,751
I got the ham on.

901
01:26:45,817 --> 01:26:50,552
- Ham? No! We got to get out of here.
- Don't start that with me.

902
01:26:50,617 --> 01:26:52,592
- Shut up!
- Bobby!

903
01:26:52,665 --> 01:26:54,192
You're hurting me.

904
01:27:10,973 --> 01:27:12,915
Gee whiz, Mom.

905
01:27:14,077 --> 01:27:16,598
I'm sorry. I...

906
01:27:16,669 --> 01:27:20,445
- I just wanted to show you something.
- Show me what?

907
01:27:20,510 --> 01:27:22,365
My... my car.

908
01:27:22,430 --> 01:27:25,246
Yeah. Gosh, don't you remember
the new car?

909
01:27:25,311 --> 01:27:27,515
The car? No. No.

910
01:27:27,583 --> 01:27:30,879
Let's go.
Don't want to miss the big game.

911
01:27:30,944 --> 01:27:33,760
Dad's waiting downstairs.
You know how he is.

912
01:27:33,825 --> 01:27:37,600
- Your father?
- Yeah. Good old Dad. What a guy.

913
01:27:37,666 --> 01:27:40,000
You're not Bobby.
You're not Bobby!

914
01:27:40,065 --> 01:27:42,554
- You're not him! Let me-
- Please!

915
01:27:45,122 --> 01:27:47,578
God, lady.
Don't wake up now.

916
01:27:47,651 --> 01:27:49,920
Open the door,
you hear me?

917
01:27:49,988 --> 01:27:51,362
Open the door.

918
01:27:54,500 --> 01:27:57,500
Come on, lady.
Open the door.

919
01:27:57,573 --> 01:27:59,199
Don't you hear me?

920
01:27:59,269 --> 01:28:01,276
You're going to get killed.

921
01:28:01,349 --> 01:28:02,724
You're going to die.

922
01:28:02,789 --> 01:28:04,033
Come on.

923
01:28:50,638 --> 01:28:52,100
Frank!

924
01:29:02,415 --> 01:29:03,790
Don't you touch me.

925
01:29:03,856 --> 01:29:06,923
Don't you touch me.
Help! Frank! Frank!

926
01:29:14,642 --> 01:29:15,722
Mason?

927
01:29:20,403 --> 01:29:22,825
Move back.
You heard the man.

928
01:29:53,337 --> 01:29:56,632
Get that strap on her.
Come on, let's go.

929
01:29:57,881 --> 01:29:59,507
Stay back, behind here.

930
01:30:02,714 --> 01:30:05,976
Mason. Mason, where-
where is she?

931
01:30:06,042 --> 01:30:07,417
I- I don't know.

932
01:30:07,483 --> 01:30:10,331
For the love of God. Faye!

933
01:30:15,644 --> 01:30:17,816
Faye, you all right?

934
01:30:17,885 --> 01:30:19,259
Is she all right?

935
01:30:19,325 --> 01:30:21,180
Get back on the sidewalk.

936
01:30:21,246 --> 01:30:23,580
I'm going along.
I'm her husband.

937
01:30:27,166 --> 01:30:28,115
Go!

938
01:30:31,007 --> 01:30:32,021
Hey!

939
01:30:32,095 --> 01:30:33,143
Carlos!

940
01:30:35,455 --> 01:30:36,830
No!

941
01:31:21,416 --> 01:31:23,838
What the hell
are you stopping for?

942
01:31:23,912 --> 01:31:26,052
That.

943
01:31:26,121 --> 01:31:28,488
I don't see anything.
It's just junk.

944
01:31:28,553 --> 01:31:31,423
Come on, get moving.
We haven't got all day.

945
01:31:31,497 --> 01:31:32,871
What's your hurry, Kovacs?

946
01:31:32,938 --> 01:31:34,793
The building's down.
You won.

947
01:31:34,858 --> 01:31:36,385
Hip-hip-hooray!

948
01:31:36,458 --> 01:31:38,793
Leave the guy alone.
How long can he stay there?

949
01:31:38,859 --> 01:31:41,674
Look. I want him
out of my way.

950
01:31:42,699 --> 01:31:45,188
When he moves, we move.

951
01:31:45,260 --> 01:31:47,147
Not till then.

952
01:33:23,008 --> 01:33:24,896
Now, here we are, dear.

953
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:28,736
Just give me your arm
and slip it through here.

954
01:33:28,801 --> 01:33:29,695
No.

955
01:33:29,761 --> 01:33:32,577
Be a good girl
and put this on.

956
01:33:32,642 --> 01:33:34,497
Are we going home now?

957
01:33:34,562 --> 01:33:36,417
A different kind of home,

958
01:33:36,482 --> 01:33:37,857
but very nice.

959
01:33:37,923 --> 01:33:39,778
Across the river,
in Jersey.

960
01:33:39,843 --> 01:33:41,218
You know who's there?

961
01:33:41,283 --> 01:33:43,618
Muriel and Sid.
Do you remember?

962
01:33:43,684 --> 01:33:45,539
I want to go home.

963
01:33:45,604 --> 01:33:46,979
We'll be together.

964
01:33:47,044 --> 01:33:48,571
That's all that counts.

965
01:33:48,644 --> 01:33:50,467
Uh, excuse me.

966
01:33:50,533 --> 01:33:51,875
Mr. Riley?

967
01:33:51,941 --> 01:33:53,502
Uh...

968
01:33:53,574 --> 01:33:56,640
I brought these here
for your wife.

969
01:33:57,735 --> 01:33:59,557
Some doughnuts.

970
01:34:05,575 --> 01:34:07,430
Faye...

971
01:34:07,495 --> 01:34:09,732
look who's here.

972
01:34:11,688 --> 01:34:14,144
It's Bobby.

973
01:34:14,217 --> 01:34:16,072
He came back.

974
01:34:16,137 --> 01:34:18,145
How about that?

975
01:34:54,064 --> 01:34:55,438
Mason Baylor?

976
01:34:55,504 --> 01:34:57,293
Marisa Esteval?

977
01:34:58,513 --> 01:35:00,236
Would you come with me?

978
01:35:01,489 --> 01:35:04,075
Uh... Mr. and Mrs. Riley?

979
01:35:23,829 --> 01:35:26,644
Fantastic! Unbelievable!
I love the whole thing-

980
01:35:26,710 --> 01:35:29,296
especially the sconces
and corbellings,

981
01:35:29,366 --> 01:35:30,740
the moldings, the relief!

982
01:35:30,806 --> 01:35:32,629
Oh, it's perfect.

01:35:36,823 --> 01:35:38,679
Hey, it's Harry.

984
01:35:43,032 --> 01:35:46,229
They're back, Faye.
They're back.

985
01:35:48,793 --> 01:35:50,168
Good morning, chief.

986
01:35:50,233 --> 01:35:52,088
How do you like it?

987
01:36:04,956 --> 01:36:07,826
Mr. Lacey, this building burned
last night.

988
01:36:07,901 --> 01:36:11,130
- Can you give us an explanation?
- Obviously, somebody made a mistake.

989
01:36:11,198 --> 01:36:14,013
What are your plans for this site,
in view of what's happened?

990
01:36:14,078 --> 01:36:18,334
- My plans remain unchanged.
- You know what I think? It's a fake.

991
01:36:18,398 --> 01:36:20,788
It's prefab, fiberglass.
These people are jerkin' us around.

992
01:36:22,303 --> 01:36:25,533
If you want me to get rid of these
reporters, I'll get rid of them.

993
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:26,975
You're fired, kid.
