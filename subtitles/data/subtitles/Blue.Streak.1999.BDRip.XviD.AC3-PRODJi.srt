1
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,114
Moving on up.

2
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,874
Believe that!

3
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,072
Ladies, we got picture.

4
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,110
What about the alarm?

5
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,231
Miles, what do you think I'm doing?

6
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,318
Just cool out. We like to run
a loose crew around here.

7
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,869
You're the boss, Miles.

8
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,229
It's like that?

9
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,589
It's like that.

10
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,674
I'm gonna go check on Tulley.

11
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,234
<i>Tulley, we cool down there?</i>

12
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,513
Yeah, we're cool, man.

13
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,596
<i>Good.</i>

14
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,399
Cool is good.

15
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,869
Are you smoking?

16
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,719
No. Negative.

17
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:42,876
<i>You're lying!</i>

18
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,071
I smell the menthol up here, man!

19
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,836
What would your mama do
if she knew you were smoking?

20
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,632
<i>Cut it out, man!</i>

21
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,395
Stay alert.

22
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,673
You ready over here?

23
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,634
Damn it! Eddie, why you
gotta do that every time?

24
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,636
It's good luck.

25
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,633
It's bad luck if I land in it.
Believe that.

26
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,398
Don't fall in that shit.

27
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:11,956
See you, Deke.

28
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,994
Good luck, guys.

29
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,799
<i>How's the weather up there?</i>

30
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,069
Snowing.

31
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,432
It's beginning to look
a lot like Christmas.

32
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,717
You got a guard 20 feet from you.

33
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,553
Ten feet.
He's closing in fast.

34
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,869
Around the corner.

35
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,068
<i>He turned around.</i>

36
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,469
Forget it. He's gone.

37
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,350
So much for the easy part. Kit.

38
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,070
- Shit!
- Bam!

39
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,514
I hate it when you do that.

40
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,074
Eddie, check this out.

41
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,919
This is a Brigger 3300.
Toughest safe in the world.

42
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,838
- What do you do?
- Drill the lock.

43
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,429
No, you gotta check
to see if it's open.

44
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,235
It's open!

45
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:36,996
What?

46
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,512
No, I'm messing with you.
They would never do that.

47
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,472
They would never do that.

48
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,955
Glasses.

49
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,630
- I'll see you back up top.
- Right.

50
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,199
Open sesame.

51
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,709
Come on, Eddie.

52
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,316
Got the rock?

53
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,873
Miles is right behind me.

54
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,274
What the hell you doing?

55
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,436
Seventeen million four ways?

56
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,359
I'm too greedy for that.

57
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,595
No, just come on, man!

58
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,556
Shit!

59
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,992
Come here, gorgeous.

60
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,910
Got the rock. Time to roll.

61
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,348
<i>Hurry! There's lots...</i>

62
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,232
...of activity here. Let's go!

63
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,270
Shit!

64
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,515
Freeze!

65
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,230
Clear!

66
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,355
Let's go!

67
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,677
- Stay down! Don't move!
- Let me see your hands!

68
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,317
- Where's Eddie?
- He went over already.

69
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,669
- You have the rock?
- What?

70
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,790
You got the rock?

71
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,513
- What you doing?
- Give me the rock!

72
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,438
You ain't got to do this!

73
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,110
We're supposed to split this shit, man!
Why you doing this?

74
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,236
Shit!

75
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,476
Miles, you're dead,
you piece of shit!

76
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,435
Damn!

77
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,834
Good doggie!

78
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,473
Good doggie!

79
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,590
Kibbles 'n Bits!

80
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,755
Easy.

81
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,912
Where's the nearest exit?

82
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,874
Stay where you are!

83
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,110
Turn around!

84
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,318
I'm a carpenter! I was working late!

85
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,712
See? That's the saw!
See? I was working!

86
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,514
You're under arrest.
You have the right to remain silent.

87
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,518
Anything you say can and will
be used against you.

88
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,235
If you can't afford an attorney,
one will be appointed for you.

89
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,839
Do you understand your rights?

90
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,636
Yeah, I understand them.

91
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,392
Ain't nothing but a free thing, baby!

92
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,677
Free man. Believe that.

93
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,113
One belt, one shoelace...

94
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,311
...one wallet containing $22.

95
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,874
One shoelace?

96
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,112
You know how much them shoes cost?
One shoelace?

97
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,072
I came in here with two.

98
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,753
You took my shoelace?
Did you take my shoelace, man?

99
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,034
You got two seconds
to walk out that door.

100
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,190
Sign out...

101
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,958
...and leave my pen.

102
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,594
I'm signing out.

103
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,195
I got places to go, people to see.

104
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,118
My lady, Janiece.

105
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,634
Ass...

106
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,069
It's like that.

107
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,875
What you gonna do with one shoelace?
Let me in on the secret.

108
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,878
Floss your ass?

109
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,635
Gotta go.

110
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,399
Y'all stay up, man.
Don't be mad because I gotta go.

111
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,150
Come on, open this fence.
Thanks. I'm out of here.

112
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,918
Where them butt-naked hoes at?
Do you know?

113
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,199
Let me up out of here.

114
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,188
I'm free! I'm free at last!

115
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,636
Gotta go!

116
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,193
Gotta go, gotta go!

117
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,554
I'm out of here!

118
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,434
Damn!

119
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,198
What happened?

120
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,956
Did you eat the whole time
I was in there?

121
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,879
When I left, you was
like plickety-cow, plickety-pat.

122
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,832
Now, you're like va-voom!

123
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:13,032
Wait a minute. That's all right.
I can adjust.

124
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,789
It's the love that counts.
I can adjust to a plus-size woman.

125
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,833
Just more cushion for the pushin'!

126
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,594
Janiece!

127
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,354
Your sad-ass sack of bones is here.

128
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,429
I apologize. You're her cousin!

129
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,268
Can I buy you some cereal?

130
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,839
It's okay, Shawna.

131
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,637
There you are. Just hot!

132
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,476
Baby, you are...

133
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,714
You look beautiful.

134
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,874
You are beautiful. And that's
not two years of prison talking.

135
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,674
Baby, it must've been hard
in there for you.

136
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:52,117
All alone at night in your little cot.

137
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,953
Tell me something, Miles.

138
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,398
Did you think about me?

139
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,476
Think about you all the time.

140
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,756
Think about you right now.

141
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,710
Then you should've thought about that
before you robbed people!

142
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,272
I never robbed you!

143
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,872
I'm a rehabilitated man!

144
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,669
Talk to me!

145
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,918
I didn't come see you for two years.
Wasn't that a sign?

146
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,636
You couldn't stand
to see your man like that.

147
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,830
Man?

148
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,874
You're not my man. You lie.
You told me you were a banker.

149
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,588
Bank robber. Yeah, see,
sometime I stutter.

150
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,678
But I'm getting that whole
speech impediment thing...

151
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:40,716
You are a very smart man, but the entire
time we spent together was one big lie.

152
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,668
Look, Janiece. Listen to me, okay?

153
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,760
I know I lied about some things,
but I can change.

154
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,029
I don't think so.

155
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,076
Bye!

156
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,714
Don't do me like this!

157
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,072
Fifth and Grand?

158
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,475
How you doing?
Is this really a police station?

159
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,994
Of course.

160
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,829
Hi. I have a delivery for Traffic.

161
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,148
Sign by the "X."

162
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:18,559
What have we got?
Egg roll, orange chicken...

163
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,712
Hot pizza coming through. Hot pizza!

164
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,956
Got to get the officers
their pizza.

165
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,954
They got to protect and serve.
The police got to eat too!

166
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,633
Let the officers eat, please.

167
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,111
I'm the pizza man here
to deliver the pizza. Thank you.

168
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,151
Officers, I got your pizzas!

169
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,837
"Third Floor: Robbery-Homicide. "

170
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,515
Yeah, please be careful.
Pizza's very hot.

171
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:47,269
Don't want nobody to get hurt.
Just got here some pizza for you.

172
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,199
Pizza for you. That's how we do it
down at the pizza place.

173
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,756
Watch it, watch it, watch it!

174
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,917
Two time, bring it up!
Don't drop the pizza!

175
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,195
Pizza delivery for Robbery-Homicide.

176
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,477
Robbery-Homicide?

177
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,434
Why is it I don't see
Robbery-Homicide...

178
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,790
...with a pizza delivery
in the log-in sheet?

179
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:16,316
I'll tell you what. Why don't you
leave that pizza with me?

180
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:19,637
No, I'll tell you what.
Last time I left a pizza here...

181
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,478
...it magically disappeared.

182
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,359
I mean, it's just like
leaving candy around me.

183
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,149
It's not gonna be all right.
I'm gonna chomp it up. See?

184
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,636
Two kinds of people
get through that door:

185
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,394
People wearing handcuffs.
People wearing a badge.

186
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,278
You don't have on either.

187
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,991
Well, I don't have
a badge or handcuffs, so...

188
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,116
Officer Carlson.

189
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:45,234
- We wanna flip that card right over.
- Sorry. Just got it.

190
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,193
Excuse me, officer.

191
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:52,150
The guys in Homicide ordered this pizza
about an hour ago.

192
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,834
I don't wanna leave them
with Shamu over there.

193
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,953
What do you want me to do?

194
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:00,956
Take them!

195
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,435
- I'm on duty. I can't do that.
- Yes, you can!

196
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,437
Please take that!

197
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,832
Thank you very much!

198
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,518
Break it down.

199
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,433
Two time, left!

200
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,750
One time! Break it down to the ground!

201
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,030
Go here!

202
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,470
Left leg! Bring it around!

203
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,473
Walk!

204
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,716
You hid a diamond
in the police station?

205
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:39,276
I didn't know it was a police station.
Can you change the I.D. Or not?

206
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:43,519
Sure, but won't they be suspicious of
a pizza man with a security clearance?

207
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,756
I'm not going back as a pizza man.

208
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,069
What are you going as?

209
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,110
A cop.

210
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,315
A cop?

211
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,550
A new transfer.

212
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:54,230
That's why I need that I.D.
And a new file for detective.

213
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,829
Why a detective?

214
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,837
That's where the rock is.

215
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,113
It's gonna be expensive.

216
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,309
Uncle Lou, I thought we was like family.

217
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:08,120
Yeah, well, "like family" is not family.

218
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,551
If you were family,
you'd want it for free, right?

219
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,839
Well, you ain't changed.
I'll see you later.

220
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,908
Get down!

221
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,429
Put some clothes on!
Get your butt-naked ass down!

222
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,398
Get your butt-naked ass down!

223
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,831
He's naked and he's stinking.
Somebody get him some clothes.

224
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,752
He's hiding a gun in his ass!

225
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,190
Get on the ground. Do it now.

226
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,475
Don't I know you?

227
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,396
Freeze!

228
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,396
Cuff him!

229
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,192
Yeah, cuff his ass.

230
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,231
I'm gonna cuff you like that.

231
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,472
I'm the good cop.
You act up, I'll turn into the bad one.

232
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,552
Freeze! Get them up!

233
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,318
Spread your legs now.

234
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,835
I'm an officer of the law.

235
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,029
Any sign of Deacon?

236
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,357
Last I heard, he was pulling
rip jobs in Carson.

237
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,194
- I warned you about that guy.
- That you did.

238
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,391
He'll know you're out.

239
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,676
This is purely cosmetic.
It won't check out.

240
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,395
Don't worry. I'll be out of there
in an hour, max. Thanks.

241
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,436
Good luck.

242
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,234
Hey there, officer dog.

243
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,510
I'm a detective.

244
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,675
Sorry, sir.

245
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,989
She's never done that.

246
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,398
Must be the pastrami.

247
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,630
Bitch!

248
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,430
Are you going up?

249
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,114
Up. Third floor.

250
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,633
Appreciate it.

251
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:24,836
What?

252
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,316
What?

253
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:54,429
The vehicle belonged to your friend,
but you don't remember his name?

254
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,599
Do you have a last name?

255
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,635
Damn, these cuffs are tight, man!

256
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,038
Miss Green, could you tell
this man to loosen these cuffs?

257
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,670
I can't feel my fingers, man.
I'm serious. Please?

258
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,518
- I know it.
- Detective.

259
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,479
Not so tight.

260
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,557
Maybe I could loosen them up a bit.

261
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,078
You got a great lawyer there.
Top of the line. Here you go.

262
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,995
He's in here!

263
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,669
Jesus!

264
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,589
How y'all doing?

265
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,679
Not again, Carlson!

266
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,472
The guy body-slammed me, sir.

267
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,709
Maybe he likes you.

268
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,035
He did what to you?

269
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:16,875
Get him out of here! What were
you thinking? Man, that's not smart!

270
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,474
Get him out of here.

271
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,638
What the hell happened up there?

272
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,715
Up here?

273
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,190
I caught him trying to escape.

274
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,439
Who the hell are you?

275
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,996
Malone. Just transferred.
Right there.

276
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,077
Yeah, check that out. Bam!

277
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,429
- You know Malone?
- No.

278
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,073
Nobody told me about it.

279
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,549
Guys...

280
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,110
Sorry, ma'am.

281
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,038
Excuse me.

282
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,511
Let me flush, please.

283
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:56,230
I didn't know.
You might not wanna go in there.

284
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,829
You got some paperwork for me, Malone?

285
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,798
We've been requesting
a new detective for 8 months.

286
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,913
Suddenly, you just turn up.
I'll never understand the system.

287
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:13,230
Burglary? Sixteen citations,
mayor's commendation.

288
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,030
You worked out of West Covina?

289
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,277
Well, that's what it says right there.

290
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,560
You look familiar, Malone.
Have we met before?

291
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,633
You wouldn't happen to be
in a bowling league, would you?

292
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:32,154
That's it. You're a bowler.

293
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,196
I try.

294
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,072
We could use a guy in Burglary.

295
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,274
Right here.

296
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:42,832
I thought I was gonna be assigned
to a desk. Right up in here!

297
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,109
Are you kidding me?

298
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,312
A guy like you?
No, you belong on the street.

299
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:48,795
And also, listen.

300
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,675
Carlson needs a partner with some
experience. He just got promoted.

301
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,593
Chief, I just got a call.

302
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,314
Malone's gonna join us.
Show him around.

303
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,474
And let Malone do
all the handcuffing, okay?

304
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,353
I appreciate that, yeah.

305
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,750
I'll review these.

306
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,074
This is the bullpen here.
That's Booking up there.

307
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:14,238
The holding cells are down that way.
You wanna see them?

308
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,431
Seen one, seen them all.

309
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,313
This is my desk here, sir.

310
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,839
Nice desk.

311
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,110
Thanks. Let's see...

312
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,749
Brass is on five.

313
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,234
Robbery-Homicide on three.

314
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,396
Over there, that's the tag and bag.

315
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:31,240
- Through those doors, that's 10-17.
- Roger.

316
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,834
Show him the rest later.

317
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,553
- Come on.
- Where?

318
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,439
We got a call. Burglary.
It's ours. I'll take this.

319
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,436
Outside?

320
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,232
That's where all the crime is.

321
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,510
I just got here,
and that's not a good thing.

322
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,070
I gotta do work in here so that
I know what's going on out there.

323
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,838
I might need backup, right?

324
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,958
How long you been in Burglary?

325
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,714
Me? All my life, man, all my life.

326
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:00,835
I heard the chief say that you got 16
citations. That's incredible! Sixteen!

327
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,237
That's what happens when
your Uncle Lou writes your file.

328
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,635
You can ride up front if you want.

329
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,474
I knew that.

330
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,270
You just gotta be real careful
for the pedestrians coming out here.

331
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,078
Walking around out here.

332
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:22,230
Am I clear to the right?
Am I clear? Have I got it?

333
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,348
I just made detective.

334
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,629
No kidding.

335
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:32,310
I worked Traffic for three years.
I got pretty good at it.

336
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:39,511
You don't have to stop for the yellow.
You could just drive right through.

337
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:44,475
Sir, not if you'd seen some
of the accidents I've seen. No thanks.

338
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,435
Well, there's your green right there.

339
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,758
Can I ask you a personal question?

340
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,598
Yeah, sure.

341
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,071
How many times did you take the test?

342
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,196
What test?

343
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,039
You know, the test for detective.

344
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,629
That one!

345
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,239
- One time.
- Really?

346
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,033
Aced it.

347
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,279
Took it out.

348
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,630
Took me five tries.

349
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:15,954
I did well on the written part, but
my performance reviews weren't so hot.

350
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:19,675
How many times did it take you
to get your driver's license, man?

351
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:22,519
Please! Wake me up when we get there.

352
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,392
Yes, sir. I'm sorry.

353
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,431
Goodness, man!

354
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,710
It's a nice suit, sir.
It's really cool.

355
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,512
Well, I appreciate it.

356
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,597
Yeah, you know? Appreciate it.

357
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,676
Got any music?

358
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,393
Oh, yeah. Sure.

359
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,594
I like to jam.

360
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,394
Just so long as
we can hear the dispatcher.

361
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,079
That's good.

362
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:48,628
- I never heard this station before.
- Kind of funky. You like that?

363
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,150
Last night these shelves were loaded
with Elites. Now they're gone.

364
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,953
Three dozen gorgeous rims.

365
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,679
They didn't take anything else?

366
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,839
They went for my good stuff. Chrome
with gold trim. Five grand worth.

367
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,869
What about the alarm?

368
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,877
What about it? It went off.

369
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,116
But it took you guys
two hours to get here.

370
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,436
My wheels are probably
in Tijuana by now.

371
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,119
Here's where they came in.

372
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:26,712
Looks like they broke the glass, opened
the handle, crawled in the window.

373
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,949
Exactly.

374
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,991
Shimmied down the shelf or something.

375
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,349
This is a waste of time.

376
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,152
That's not how they got in.

377
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,834
Of course it is.

378
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,071
Cut it out.
That's not how they got in.

379
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,389
This is the spot here.

380
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,352
That's how I would've came in.

381
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,718
If I was a thief.

382
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,632
If I was a thief!

383
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:47,673
Skylight. Just cut the alarm
from the inside.

384
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,598
I could take my time.

385
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,755
Why take your time?

386
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,759
Why would I take my time?

387
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,634
It's heavy.

388
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,953
Now, you tell me.

389
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:05,711
How long would it take to carry 3 dozen
of those out and load them in a truck?

390
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,593
- Long time.
- It would take a very long time.

391
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:12,110
But they probably had three
or four guys working the damn thing...

392
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,550
Zip! Zip the shit up! Frank, hush.

393
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,996
Because you know better. Come on.

394
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,909
Don't lie to me. I'm the man.
I'm the man, Frank.

395
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,479
You're the man.

396
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:27,352
Your 5000, sorry to tell you,
is worth less than two on the street.

397
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,797
Which don't go four ways
with much juice once you rent a truck.

398
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,915
And to rent a truck, that requires what?

399
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,119
Credit card...

400
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,836
...driver's license.

401
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,278
Unless, of course...

402
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,679
...you got your own truck.

403
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,596
He's not gonna let us
search his truck.

404
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,519
What you mean, "let us"? We the police.

405
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,438
We need a warrant to do that.

406
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,636
We don't even need a key.

407
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:00,114
Detective, you can't do that.
It's unconstitutional.

408
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,917
Look at that. Look at this.

409
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,276
Look.

410
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,278
Solved the crime
my first day on the job!

411
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,754
We bad detectives.

412
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,756
There they are!

413
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:17,749
Filing a false report
is a very serious crime.

414
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:24,230
I'll handle this.
Bring your weeble-wobble ass over here.

415
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:29,039
- You like snacks?
- Nothing makes me happier.

416
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:32,710
You'll be snacking on the bottom
of this shoe if this happens again.

417
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,399
Now, you see them ridges?

418
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:37,478
These ridges will be imprinted
on the back of your ass...

419
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,075
...permanently if this happens again.

420
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,269
You understand?

421
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,595
Thoroughly understand you.

422
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:46,475
Every time you look at your ass
there's gonna be a print there.

423
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,398
It's gonna remind you of us.

424
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,638
- And of you lying.
- Right.

425
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,519
Don't wanna see those ridges.

426
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:56,992
Stop eating cold cuts because
it's seeping through your pores.

427
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,315
Will do.

428
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,034
I'll put one ridge on your ass.

429
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:04,830
Let's roll. That's cool.
Let's get out of here.

430
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,070
Detective, I know I'm new at this...

431
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:12,033
...but I thought we were supposed
to arrest the bad guys.

432
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,032
Now he owes us one.

433
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,559
So that's how it works.

434
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:19,708
We let the little fish go, so that
we can catch the big fish later.

435
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,273
I got it. I got it.

436
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,392
You mind if I drive?
I know a shortcut.

437
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,754
You might wanna buckle up.

438
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:43,480
Are you in a hurry, sir?

439
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:46,632
Just testing your car.
Balancing out your shit.

440
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,269
When was the last time
you got all up on this thing?

441
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,835
I've never gotten all up
on anything, sir.

442
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,072
Sometimes you gotta feed
some speed to your ride.

443
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,159
Sir! Watch it!

444
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:09,033
This is the police!
Move your busted-ass vehicle!

445
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,317
Move, move, move, move, move!

446
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,033
This is the LAPD.

447
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,673
We'll pop one in your ass.

448
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,711
We got guns and shit.

449
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,314
I could get used to this!

450
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,796
I like!

451
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,433
I like!

452
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,755
Used to what?

453
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:29,870
Driving. See, my last partner
did all the driving.

454
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,038
Who was your partner?

455
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,158
I don't wanna talk about it.

456
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,595
Why?

457
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:41,556
Hey, look, I'm deep, okay? There's
just some places I can't talk about.

458
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:45,270
We're partners. We gotta communicate.
This thing's like a marriage.

459
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,670
No, this is nothing like a marriage.

460
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,833
- What is it like?
- It's more like a one-night stand.

461
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,674
Wham, bam, thank you, officer.

462
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,190
- It's like that?
- It's like that.

463
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:03,990
We're just gonna fight crime
and zip the rest of that shit up.

464
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,593
Are you married?

465
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,239
- Girlfriend?
- Not anymore.

466
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,316
What happened?

467
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,438
Work got in the way.

468
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,515
See?

469
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,311
Somebody took out a fire hydrant.

470
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,478
- I'll handle this.
- I gotta get back. I got a headache.

471
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,432
We're on duty.

472
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:36,474
But I need an aspirin.
A big one, like a hockey puck.

473
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:38,079
Gentlemen. Excuse me.

474
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,231
Could you come here for a second?

475
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,836
Relax, sir.
Just take it easy for a second.

476
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,833
Morning, officer.

477
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,638
Morning. Where's your aspirins?

478
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,677
Back there by the soda machines.

479
00:34:59,040 --> 00:34:59,836
Appreciate it.

480
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,115
I wanna know how the car
hit the fire hydrant.

481
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,751
- Open the register!
- Don't shoot!

482
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:16,989
Come on, man!

483
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,076
Oh, man!

484
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,594
Come on! The safe too!

485
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,476
Come on.

486
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:38,069
37-King-5.
Shots fired. Request help.

487
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,714
418 West Fifth Street.

488
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,555
Detective Malone!

489
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,835
You okay?

490
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:50,876
Oh, shit!

491
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,915
Get back! Back! Get back!

492
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,479
Freeze!

493
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,716
Put your hands on the pavement!

494
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,434
- Hands on the pavement!
- There is no pavement!

495
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,792
Put them on the Oodles of Noodles.

496
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,951
- Put them on the noodles.
- Chicken or beef?

497
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:11,990
Chicken!

498
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,436
Cool.

499
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,159
Cool is good.

500
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:17,876
Miles?

501
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,196
Tulley?

502
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:24,830
What are you doing?

503
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,190
What am I doing?
What are you doing?

504
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,271
I'm freaking working over here.

505
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,399
I'm coming in!

506
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,232
Put the gun down!

507
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,595
Put the gun down!

508
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,233
Detective Malone, talk to me!

509
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,038
Go out the back way!

510
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,998
Go! The back way!

511
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,872
Go out the back way!

512
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,715
Detective, talk to me!

513
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,669
Take two steps back!

514
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,275
What the hell? Go!

515
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,716
Hold it!

516
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,229
Hold your fire!

517
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,993
You okay?

518
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,749
Listen, it's a dead end!

519
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,592
No shit!

520
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:35,910
He's behind those dumpsters.
He's freaking out. He's got a gun.

521
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,710
Back up!

522
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,635
Get SWAT up here! Sharpshooters
can take him off from the roof.

523
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,879
No sharpshooters.

524
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,150
Why the hell not?

525
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,433
What are you doing here, man?

526
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,671
- Who's he talking to?
- I don't know.

527
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:56,998
He high, man. He's hallucinating.
Smoking that shit!

528
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,038
He's high.

529
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,358
Put down the gun and come out!

530
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,271
Hold this. Hold on. I'm going in.

531
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,356
What are you doing?

532
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,439
What are you, crazy?

533
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,438
Miles, what are you doing here?

534
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:16,633
I just wanna talk to you
before somebody gets hurt!

535
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,558
Please put down the gun!

536
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,392
- Son, come on.
- Shut up!

537
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,794
It hurts my heart...

538
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,560
...to see a kid that has
so much potential.

539
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,836
- You're smarter than that.
- I'm coming out!

540
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:31,435
Listen. All right, now, goddamn it!
What are you doing?

541
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,672
What are you doing?
You got me out here in this shit.

542
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,871
How many times I told you...

543
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:41,033
...forget the safe? Go straight for
the cash drawer. Get in and get out.

544
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,195
He's in the way.
Now I can't even get a shot.

545
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,634
I can't either.

546
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,950
Why are you hitting
mom-and-pop stores anyway?

547
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,111
Look, you're a driver, man.

548
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:54,199
You got skills. You can be out there
on the road, man, doing your shit.

549
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:58,274
I'm desperate! I need some money!
And why the freak are we whispering?

550
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,389
Back up, nigger! I saw you!

551
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,595
- What are they talking about?
- I don't know.

552
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,509
I'm working on something here,
and you're blowing it for me, man!

553
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,071
I'm sorry, man. I'm messing up.

554
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,311
- I'm messing up.
- It's all right.

555
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,112
Look, I'm not mad at you.

556
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:21,514
But you're gonna have to give me
the gun and let me arrest you.

557
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:27,595
Come on, man. Listen. I'll give you
10 grand. You know I'm good for it.

558
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,393
I'm thinking like 50, man.

559
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:33,996
Tulley, 50?
That's pushing it, man! Damn!

560
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:37,909
Twenty, and you'll spend one night
in jail. That's the best I can do.

561
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,037
That's it. Best I can do.

562
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,829
All right, fine.
But I'm keeping my gun.

563
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:47,914
You cannot let me arrest you
and keep the gun, man! Come on!

564
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,668
Damn, I just got this, man.
This is hard to find.

565
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:54,668
But you're gonna have to give up
the gun. Now, what you wanna do?

566
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:59,271
You wanna give up the gun or you want
them to put about 7 bullets in your ass?

567
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,078
Okay, now give me that gun!

568
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,390
Don't just hand it to me!

569
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:10,518
I gotta take it from you.
They're watching.

570
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,433
This is gonna hurt a little.

571
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,315
This is gonna hurt.

572
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:20,989
Jesus!

573
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,071
That's incredible!

574
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:26,273
And remember:
You don't know me anymore.

575
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,919
I sure don't.

576
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,792
You didn't used to be so violent.

577
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,996
So he's like,
"Carlson, take my jacket. "

578
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:35,397
He's like, "I got to do this. "
We're like, "What are you doing?"

579
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,797
He just goes right down the alley,
right up to the guy.

580
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,508
Next thing you know,
he's taking the guy's gun.

581
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:44,632
Dropped the guy with a punch.
Just leveled him.

582
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,758
I mean, blink and
you would've missed it.

583
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,793
Malone, in my office!

584
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,439
Now!

585
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,549
Not you, Carlson.

586
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,356
I've been looking through your record.

587
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,352
How come I never heard of you?

588
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,315
I was undercover. On the down low.

589
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:11,796
We need a guy to head Burglary.
Is that the real reason you're here?

590
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,036
Yeah, sure.

591
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,036
It's no secret.

592
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:19,831
Burglary's been a problem division since
we lost our lead detective last year.

593
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,714
Now, usually we promote
from within the ranks...

594
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,791
...but these guys need someone new.

595
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,235
So if you want the job, you got it.

596
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:30,989
Excuse me?

597
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,834
You're the new lead detective.
Burglary division.

598
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,190
Me?

599
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:43,832
Technically, there's a 30-day qualifying
period before I can make it official...

600
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:47,237
...but with your record I don't think
there'll be any problem.

601
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,272
Well, say something!

602
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,033
Thank you.

603
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,679
Let's party?

604
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,078
What is this? High school?

605
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:08,195
Listen up. As of now, Detective Malone
is Burglary's new acting lead detective.

606
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,789
Get these processed ASAP.

607
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,279
Thank you.

608
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,237
I got some things I gotta do.
I'll catch up with you later.

609
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,234
I'll take these.

610
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:22,271
- You know what to do with these?
- Sure.

611
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,833
Great, sir. Sorry.

612
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,392
- Captain Penelli?
- I'm busy now.

613
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,038
Oh, man!

614
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,233
Shit!

615
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:17,639
Damn!

616
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:29,829
What?

617
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,555
How do you want me
to handle the rotation?

618
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,631
I don't understand.
What you mean, "rotation"?

619
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,432
The shifts.

620
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:42,115
I can't figure out everything
on the first day, all right?

621
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:45,039
I notice you guys had a leak here.
What's that about?

622
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:47,879
One of the hot-water pipes burst,
flooded all the vents.

623
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,349
They had to flush out the whole system.

624
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,994
This must be the guy
everybody's talking about.

625
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:56,031
Captain Penelli, Detective Malone.

626
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,514
Malone, Penelli.

627
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:02,188
I hear great things.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

628
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:09,637
Nice to meet you too there, sir!

629
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,193
Very nice to meet you!

630
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:13,834
Glad to be here.

631
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:15,433
Gotta go!

632
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:20,832
He's a strange one.

633
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:37,438
Place is closed.

634
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:41,159
I said we're closed.
I should've locked up.

635
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,074
Nice to see you, Lou.

636
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,832
I'm looking for Miles.

637
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:48,191
Well, I haven't seen him.

638
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,789
I got an important message
from his mother.

639
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,597
Well, I still haven't seen him.

640
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:58,468
Quiet.

641
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:04,833
Damn, you're good.

642
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:11,359
You are good.

643
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:54,229
Good morning. Listen up.

644
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:58,319
Word is that Jean LaFleur is bringing
a shipment of heroin through town.

645
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:01,993
They want him in San Diego.

646
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:04,156
SDPD's done an excellent job...

647
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:07,352
...shutting down the harbor
and the airports on him.

648
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:19,672
Detective Malone just transferred.
He'll head our Burglary division.

649
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:21,868
Detective...

650
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:24,150
...tell us a little about your plans.

651
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,879
Well, I plan to fight crime.

652
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,519
You know, shit like that.

653
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:36,516
Great, then.

654
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,990
Does anybody have any questions
for Malone?

655
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:41,838
Yeah, I got a question.

656
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:43,911
What do you think about the P-31?

657
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:46,753
P-31.

658
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:49,676
What do you think?

659
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:51,074
It's a piece of shit.

660
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:56,794
What I mean is, we've all been having
problems with the P-31, right?

661
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:01,471
I'm just wondering what the new lead
detective here plans to do about it.

662
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:05,071
Well, all right.
Well, Diaz, is it? Diaz?

663
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:08,392
What do you think we should do
about it, Diaz?

664
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:10,273
I think we should scrap it.

665
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:13,878
How many people think
we should scrap the P-31?

666
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:17,435
There it is.

667
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:19,596
Scrapped. Why?
Because you want it scrapped.

668
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:23,270
It's out of there. P-31, out of there.
No more. Gone.

669
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,551
You want 31 flavors?

670
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:28,797
Baskin-Robbins is
where you wanna be. Be cool.

671
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:30,752
That's my partner.

672
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,110
Detective.

673
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,952
What is it?

674
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,758
I'd like to work with a P-40.

675
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,075
Yeah, the P-40's good.

676
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,239
P-40 it is!

677
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:49,631
What's he doing?
We just got those things.

678
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:52,957
He's shaking things up.
Maybe that's exactly what we need.

679
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:11,552
I'm not a cop.

680
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,434
This Tulley asshole
wants to talk to you.

681
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,312
He's down in Interrogation.

682
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:19,951
Right away. I'll talk with him.

683
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:22,512
Interrogation's this way.

684
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:24,995
Knew that. Is he running his mouth?

685
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:28,798
Tulley says he has information
about another robbery.

686
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,639
But he'll only talk
to the officer who arrested him.

687
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,191
I'll talk to him. Alone.

688
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:36,958
We'll be watching.

689
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:42,350
What's going on? You said
I'd spend one night in jail.

690
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:55,388
What do you wanna tell me?
What is it?

691
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:57,591
You said I'd only spend
one night in jail.

692
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:59,438
It's only been one night.

693
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:01,437
Well, where's my 50 grand?

694
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:03,478
I said 20 grand.

695
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:06,030
Well, maybe it's 50 now! Because...

696
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:13,630
Detectives, I've been assigned
to Mr. Tulley.

697
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:16,229
Well, great. That's him.

698
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:19,273
Oh, my God! What in the world?

699
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:20,913
- Help me!
- What's going on?

700
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:22,996
Help!

701
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:24,315
What is this?

702
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:29,558
Oh, my God!

703
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:36,393
Take your hands off my client!

704
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:38,759
It's no use. He ain't talking!

705
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:40,837
You have your hand over his mouth!

706
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:50,235
I think we accomplished
enough for one day.

707
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:53,757
This guy said he has information
on another case.

708
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:56,315
I wanna know, are you jerking
our chain or not?

709
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:58,238
I'm not jerking your chain, fella.

710
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:02,399
This guy Logan owes me
50 thousand dollars.

711
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,077
If I don't get it soon...

712
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,077
...I'm talking!

713
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:09,669
Who's Logan?
And what do you know about him?

714
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:13,988
All I can tell you, sir,
is that he's gay, gay, gay!

715
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:15,713
I've had enough of this!

716
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:19,629
You certainly have. Come with me.
You'll be hearing from my office!

717
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:22,115
- He made me bite my tongue.
- Come here.

718
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:23,670
He hit me here.

719
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:26,156
Next time use a phone book on him.

720
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:27,998
And they took my shoelace.

721
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:29,792
Hearing from your office!

722
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,797
Look how she's all over him.

723
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:34,952
And then he said I was ugly
and I couldn't read good.

724
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:41,198
Hey, man. What's up?

725
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:43,356
Some guy's been calling for you.

726
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:45,596
- Who was it?
- Said he's your old partner.

727
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:49,588
He hopes you found what you're looking
for. Your health benefits expire soon.

728
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:51,951
Whatever the hell
that's supposed to mean.

729
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:57,558
Shit!

730
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:22,236
Bingo!

731
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:28,358
What is it with you
and the heating ducts, sir?

732
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:30,953
Cold. You don't feel that?

733
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:32,429
Very cold.

734
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:34,949
But I'm busy. What is it you want?

735
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:37,628
I just tried to pull up your records.

736
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:39,239
I couldn't find any Malone.

737
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:42,917
Oh, that's probably because
it was spelled...

738
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:44,997
When I put the name in the list...

739
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,156
The badge number doesn't exist.

740
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:49,910
Let me talk to you.

741
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:53,317
- I wanna find out what's going on.
- You're gonna find out.

742
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:57,753
Now, look.

743
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:00,631
What I'm about to tell you
is classified.

744
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:04,628
You tell anyone, I will bust
your ass down to parade detail.

745
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:06,239
I've been on that detail.

746
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:09,352
That's permanent horseshit patrol.

747
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:15,277
This place is a cesspool. But listen.

748
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:16,953
I'm not from West Covina.

749
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:19,399
I'm from Internal Affairs.

750
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:21,756
Oh, man!

751
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:28,234
All right? This place is a cesspool.

752
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:31,388
- I can't believe I didn't notice!
- It is!

753
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:33,670
I mean, it doesn't seem like a cesspool.

754
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:36,997
Believe it, man! There's a lot
of dirty shit going on here!

755
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:38,952
That's why they sent me here.

756
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:41,674
I'm the supercop.
They said, "Go, investigate.

757
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,831
Do what you do.
Find another supercop.

758
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:46,873
Y'all supercop up as a team,
and crack down the shit. "

759
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:49,310
"Crack it down. "
That's what I'm here to do.

760
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:52,830
Are we the only guys that know about it?
We're in the shit now!

761
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:59,717
You are a good cop, Carlson.

762
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:02,639
But damn it, man,
you just dug too deep.

763
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:04,432
What do you want me to do?

764
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:06,358
Good thing you asked.

765
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:10,714
Keep your eyes open. Okay?
I need you to be here.

766
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:13,115
And watch my back. Watch my back.

767
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:15,754
Got it, sir. I'm out of here.

768
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:17,793
The other way. Go back.

769
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,149
Shit!

770
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,433
Evidence room.

771
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:44,715
Shit!

772
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:51,072
There you are. I just got a call.

773
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:52,838
413 in progress
at the airport.

774
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,189
Go ahead. I'll catch up.

775
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:58,279
Bullshit! Someone just stole
a museum exhibit from a cargo hold.

776
00:53:58,480 --> 00:53:59,629
That's my problem?

777
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:01,359
You're lead detective.

778
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:03,830
Get out there now!

779
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:07,350
The FBI and Customs Service
is already on the case.

780
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,989
- Why are you standing here?
- They won't let me in.

781
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:30,553
Feds are all over it.

782
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:32,273
That's bullshit!

783
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:36,632
These boxes contained
an entire Egyptian temple.

784
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:39,308
Excuse me, here.
Let me see this. Man!

785
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:40,589
And who are you?

786
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:43,314
Malone. LAPD.

787
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:45,192
Agent Gray. FBI.

788
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,794
We'll let you boys in
after we're done.

789
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:52,913
Look at all this stuff.

790
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:57,193
Look. They nearly destroyed all this
stuff and they didn't take none of it.

791
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:59,476
Look, Officer Malone.

792
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:00,874
Detective.

793
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:05,198
You know, you're out of your
jurisdiction and you're over your head.

794
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:08,517
I'm over my head?
No, I'm over your head...

795
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,551
...because your head's up your ass.

796
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:16,353
You're interfering with
a federal investigation, officer.

797
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:19,433
Now, if you and your bunch
wanna feel important...

798
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:21,870
...you can help secure
the outer perimeter.

799
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:23,755
Are we clear?

800
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:28,558
We clear.

801
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:30,632
And please...

802
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:34,435
...tell your men not to touch
anything on their way out.

803
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:37,359
- It's like that?
- Yeah, it's like that.

804
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:48,951
"Head up your ass. "
That was great.

805
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:51,350
I couldn't believe you said that.

806
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:53,471
He called me "officer. "

807
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:58,390
I'm lead detective.
I have 16 citations.

808
00:55:58,600 --> 00:55:59,999
You think that comes easy?

809
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:02,714
Come on. The guy's nothing
but an FBI asshole.

810
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:05,798
He thinks we're good for nothing
but sucking down doughnuts.

811
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,877
Let them chase their own
goddamn temple.

812
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:11,629
They weren't looking for no temple.
They were looking for drugs.

813
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:13,034
Yes, drugs.

814
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:15,037
It's the oldest trick in the book.

815
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:16,275
You smuggle it in...

816
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:20,678
...boost it before it hits customs,
right? Make it look like a heist.

817
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,677
That's how all the big boys do it.

818
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:25,718
All they have to do is
look for a truck with a "B" on it.

819
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:27,388
What do you mean, "B"?

820
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:28,953
"Bonded. "

821
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:33,148
Bonded trucks can get
into bonded warehouses.

822
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:34,550
Let me ask you:

823
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:36,758
How do you know all this stuff?

824
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:41,751
Did a little work in bonded warehouses.

825
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:44,390
All right. So what are we waiting for?

826
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:48,110
Let's do something, all right?
Come on. Call in air support.

827
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:52,039
Dispatch, this is 37-King-5...

828
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:55,630
...put me through
to South Bay air support.

829
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,509
<i>10-12. I've got a white panel truck...</i>

830
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:07,872
<i>... B-961, southbound on Wheeler
near the Manhattan Beach intersection.</i>

831
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:09,718
Roger. We're close.

832
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:14,395
Shit!

833
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:20,279
Now you're in a hurry?

834
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:25,278
Sometimes you gotta feed a little speed
to your ride. You know what I'm saying?

835
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:37,709
Here we go.

836
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:43,152
Check out the driver.

837
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:47,391
Five-feet-six, greasy hair, messy,
very disheveled and...

838
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:50,239
Are you a hairdresser
or a detective, man?

839
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:52,839
That's a jailhouse tat.

840
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:54,992
Driver did a stretch somewhere.

841
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:56,872
10-12. Requesting backup.

842
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:59,355
<i>LAPD, this is Agent Gray. FBI.</i>

843
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:02,677
<i>Stand down. I repeat: Stand down.</i>

844
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:04,393
This is bullshit!

845
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:07,160
Screw them. Come on! Let's do it!

846
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:09,439
Come on, you!

847
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:12,429
Come on, get the door.

848
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:13,550
Come on!

849
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,110
Drop your weapons!

850
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:17,753
Put it down.

851
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:20,997
All right, don't move! Stand still!

852
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:21,996
Put it down!

853
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:25,154
Malone! Take him! He's yours!

854
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:28,995
Don't you run from me! Don't you run!

855
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:31,310
Let's see those hands, butterball.

856
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:34,196
Come here!

857
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:35,913
You wanna make me run?

858
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:42,070
Come back here!

859
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:02,389
Come back here!

860
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:07,195
Bring your ass here!

861
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:08,590
Come here!

862
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:15,755
Come here!

863
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:18,351
It's okay. Don't worry. I'm a cop.

864
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:21,349
All right?

865
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:23,396
Damn!

866
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:30,310
Don't you know better
than to run from the police?

867
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:31,316
I do.

868
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:35,069
You got me tired. I don't like
to get tired. When I get tired...

869
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,474
...I got ass to whoop.

870
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:39,548
That's what I'm about to do.
Get your ass up!

871
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:45,514
Bingo.

872
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:47,358
That's the shit.

873
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:55,873
We showed them. We showed them, and
that's what I wanted to do, you know?

874
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:57,832
- Put this into evidence.
- Exactly.

875
00:59:58,040 --> 00:59:59,712
Evidence. I'll go up with it.

876
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:02,036
I want you interrogating
those men right now.

877
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:04,629
No. See, I need to go up
with this stuff...

878
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:06,956
...and book it into evidence personally.

879
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:07,956
Why?

880
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:12,394
I gotta go through it
for clues and shit.

881
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:15,912
Interrogate the suspects.
Find out where they were going.

882
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:20,558
Then, when you get them to talk, you can
go through all the evidence you want.

883
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:22,557
But, sir...

884
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:27,911
If I get the clue, it'd make
for a better ass-whooping interrogation.

885
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:29,951
Let's hear it for Detective Malone!

886
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:44,593
That's it! I want a lawyer.
You cops can't do this.

887
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:46,353
I got news for you.
I ain't a cop.

888
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:50,199
God, he's good.

889
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:52,675
I checked.
West Covina never heard of him.

890
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:55,631
- So you know.
- Know what?

891
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:57,193
He's Internal Affairs.

892
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:59,436
What are you talking about?
He's not I.A.

893
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:00,436
He's not?

894
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:01,834
Hell, no. He's FBI.

895
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:05,231
But he hates the FBI.

896
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:08,352
That's to throw you off.
You think this is an accident?

897
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:12,030
He knew about the heroin from the start.
FBI planted him here.

898
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:15,710
Thought he'd get first jump on the
burglary. Afraid we'd screw it up.

899
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:17,678
Pencil-dicks.

900
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:23,554
You don't get that training
at the academy.

901
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:25,432
No, that's old school, man.

902
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:27,312
You're crushing my head!

903
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:31,472
That's federal government training.

904
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:34,148
Like Navy SEAL stuff.

905
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:38,272
Let's go give him a hand.

906
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:43,757
All right! All right!
I'll talk! Oh, man!

907
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:17,997
Look at you.

908
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:21,510
It was all worth it for you, baby.

909
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:29,079
What are you doing up there?

910
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:34,836
I'm just so happy that we're keeping
these drugs off the street.

911
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:37,634
Get over it. They're going
right back out again.

912
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:38,716
Why?

913
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:41,992
Because the FBI wants to take it
to their lab right away.

914
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:43,269
Roll it out.

915
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:48,516
Malone, come on!

916
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,353
Let's go.

917
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:52,949
Come on, Malone.

918
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:06,789
Detective.

919
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:10,514
That heroin belongs to Jean LaFleur.

920
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:12,438
We've been after him for 5 years.

921
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:15,473
He keeps shifting his operations
between the U.S. And Mexico.

922
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:18,030
We're taking it down
to our lab right now.

923
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:19,719
That's not a good idea.

924
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:20,796
Why not?

925
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:24,032
Why don't we just keep it here?

926
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:27,516
LaFleur doesn't know we have it.
We could use it for bait.

927
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:29,909
You mean a sting?

928
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:32,754
Exactly. A sting!

929
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:37,269
LaFleur expects these drugs
to be in San Diego in three hours.

930
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:40,717
What kind of sting operation can you
get off the ground before then?

931
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:44,033
The driver told me one of the guys
on the truck was new.

932
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:46,231
You can replace him with somebody else.

933
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:50,228
Then catch LaFleur when he goes
to pick up the drugs. Bam! Got him!

934
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:51,714
Let me get this straight.

935
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:55,629
You're volunteering to escort
these drugs into the hands...

936
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:58,718
...of the most dangerous dealer
in the northern hemisphere?

937
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:00,029
Hell, no!

938
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:01,832
What do you need to make it work?

939
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:05,629
- Me?
- You're the man for the job!

940
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:08,593
FBI will have tactical command,
but we'll follow your lead.

941
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:11,633
It's very brave. Let's go.
There's not much time.

942
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:13,558
Way to go, Malone. Way to go.

943
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:17,190
- I'm just suggesting some shit.
- We need more men like you!

944
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:23,033
All right. Hurry up.
Go. Get out of here!

945
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:25,038
Wait. Hold up. Wait a minute.

946
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:28,198
You wanted to go.
I'm getting you out of here. Go!

947
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:31,159
You wouldn't still be here
unless that diamond was here.

948
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:32,156
I want my cut!

949
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:35,757
There ain't nothing to cut.
I gotta get the diamond first.

950
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,149
Go get it. I'll wait.

951
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:40,238
I'm trying to. First, I gotta
run a sting on a drug dealer.

952
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:41,919
You're a goddamn liar!

953
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:44,793
Would I make this shit up?
Get out of here!

954
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,992
- I'll see you at Lou's tomorrow.
- I wanna talk about this!

955
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:50,111
I don't know what you're doing...

956
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:51,719
...but it ain't gonna work!

957
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:53,712
And let me get my gun back!

958
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:03,549
Look. Maybe this isn't
a good idea, you know?

959
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:06,593
- This is a great idea. It'll work.
- Brilliant.

960
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:10,031
- LaFleur's looking for this.
- We know what we're doing, detective.

961
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:11,912
Oh, I'm a detective now.

962
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:13,919
Give us a level, please.

963
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,399
All right, detective.

964
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:20,639
The objective is to have these men
see you as if you were one of them:

965
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:24,549
A member of the criminal underworld.
It's important your speech...

966
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:29,430
...and your behavior are congruent with
their expectation of a fellow criminal.

967
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:32,200
I get it. Sort of "walk the walk. "

968
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:33,276
That's right.

969
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:36,234
You have to look, act...

970
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:38,635
...and even think like a criminal.

971
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:40,558
Change your speech patterns too.

972
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:44,793
Criminals like to use slang terminology
and profanity and so forth...

973
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:48,197
...especially with regard to police
and authority figures.

974
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:51,079
You mean like, "Shut the hell up,
you dickless FBl... "

975
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:52,998
- That's right.
- "You stupid ass. "

976
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:54,519
- That'll do.
- "You tight... "

977
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:55,869
Enough!

978
01:05:57,600 --> 01:05:58,635
All right, listen up.

979
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:00,512
LaFleur's a killer.

980
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:05,271
If he senses anything amiss, Malone
is gonna be in one hell of a tight spot.

981
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:13,716
If anything happens to me,
forget everything I ever told you.

982
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:15,911
You mean about Internal Affairs?

983
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:17,838
No, Carlson. I mean about everything.

984
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:20,037
Detective, saddle up.

985
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:21,753
Good luck.

986
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:28,793
Carlson, remember. Forget it!

987
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,069
Time to go.

988
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:33,436
Detective.

989
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:37,669
If my client gets a scratch
on him while he's in your custody...

990
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:42,670
...I'll see your badge is revoked
and you're thrown in jail. Okay?

991
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:44,359
You can't touch me.

992
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:50,909
He'll be fine, counselor.
Malone, let's get this show on the road.

993
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:53,512
Drive. Buckle up.

994
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:57,270
Give me video.

995
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:58,833
<i>Let's get one thing straight.</i>

996
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:01,634
This is my side here
and that's your side there.

997
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:03,956
Stay on your side
and I'm gonna stay on mine.

998
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:05,550
Gentlemen.

999
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:07,239
Keep the chatter to a minimum.

1000
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:10,352
You don't like the show,
change the channel.

1001
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:12,790
And keep this channel clear.

1002
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:18,152
Who is this guy?

1003
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:19,635
That's Malone.

1004
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:22,679
I can't drive if you do that.

1005
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:24,559
Drive!

1006
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:44,793
We're coming up on our exit.

1007
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:49,757
All units, this is Gray.
Fall back and keep your distance.

1008
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:01,039
We're approaching the site.

1009
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:03,470
LAPD, take the south side.
We'll take the north.

1010
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:29,874
They're headed into warehouse 3.

1011
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:30,950
Focus in.

1012
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:31,956
Closer.

1013
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:40,750
This is it.

1014
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:42,791
- You sure?
- Yeah. Warehouse 3.

1015
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:47,238
All right, Benny, sit tight
and keep your mouth shut.

1016
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:48,589
Thanks for the tip.

1017
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:56,109
What's Malone doing?

1018
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:05,431
<i>They're coming in behind you.</i>

1019
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:07,471
Get ready. Here he comes.

1020
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:14,470
That's what I'm talking about!

1021
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:17,231
- That's the shit.
- You're right!

1022
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:19,556
All 500 kilos!

1023
01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:23,397
What are you talking about?
Let's get out! I want my cut!

1024
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:25,636
- You still got it?
- We still have a signal.

1025
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:26,875
It's just distorted.

1026
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:29,155
Can you hear him?

1027
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:32,397
We can't get out of here, okay?
They got cops everywhere.

1028
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:33,874
So? You're one of them.

1029
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:37,154
I'm a drug dealer now.

1030
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:40,438
Man, listen to me.
You're a jewel thief.

1031
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:43,030
I'm a drug dealer now!

1032
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:45,754
Why you selling this
when you got that diamond?

1033
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:47,595
Just like old times.

1034
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:50,192
I don't believe that shit!

1035
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:53,309
Is this a reunion?

1036
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:56,398
Look what we got here. Give it up.

1037
01:09:57,240 --> 01:09:58,992
Isn't that beautiful? Say bye.

1038
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:00,670
Welcome to the party.

1039
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:02,029
Son of a bitch!

1040
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:03,988
We've lost him.

1041
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:06,714
I'll enjoy doing you more
than I did Eddie.

1042
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:08,355
Shut up!

1043
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:18,672
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1044
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:20,950
- Know anything about this?
- I don't know shit!

1045
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:22,513
I'm gonna throw up.

1046
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:30,630
What the hell?

1047
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:32,956
All units, stand by.

1048
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:38,796
What's going on?

1049
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:39,989
I don't know!

1050
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:42,519
I never know what's going on!

1051
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:49,070
Take it down!

1052
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:50,315
Here! Bring it in!

1053
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:00,752
Out of the truck. Out of the truck!

1054
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:07,519
Benny, what's going on?

1055
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:09,234
It took longer than I thought.

1056
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:11,397
- What happened to your face?
- Nothing.

1057
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:12,396
Not a big deal.

1058
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:13,993
Who hired these two guys?

1059
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:15,918
I did. You told me to get guys.

1060
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:18,717
You didn't introduce me.
How you doing?

1061
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:21,639
Pete. Nice to meet you.
Heard a lot about you.

1062
01:11:23,240 --> 01:11:24,434
And who might you be?

1063
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:28,279
Don't mess with him.
That's a stone-cold killer.

1064
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:31,319
You don't want to mess with him.
He's stone-cold.

1065
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:36,630
That boy is bad. I seen him rip
somebody's guts out through their ass...

1066
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:38,433
...and their eyes fell out.

1067
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:39,629
Do the move you do!

1068
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:41,956
The gut-and-eyes move.

1069
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:53,195
That's where they went splat.
Just dropped them.

1070
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:54,469
I'm bad.

1071
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:58,628
I'll rip your lips off and
kiss my ass with them shits.

1072
01:11:58,840 --> 01:11:59,795
I seen him do it.

1073
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,479
I do that.
That's how I get down.

1074
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:04,717
I'll rip your tongue out
and lick my balls with them.

1075
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:06,035
Shut up.

1076
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:07,475
Check him out.

1077
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,877
Francois, you search him.

1078
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:13,398
- We're moving in.
- No, wait.

1079
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:16,075
This must be a part of his plan.

1080
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:18,669
What plan?
He's unarmed and outnumbered.

1081
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:21,474
Trust me.
You should see Malone's rsum.

1082
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:24,875
This is like a walk in the park for him.

1083
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:27,152
I must tell you, Pete.

1084
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:29,512
You look the part...

1085
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,877
...you certainly talk the talk...

1086
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:35,715
...but you still stink like a cop.

1087
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:38,552
Damn it!
I knew he would catch us, man.

1088
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:40,398
Shut up! That's bullshit.

1089
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:44,235
Come on, man. Just talk to him.
We might get out of here!

1090
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:46,473
See? He's lying!

1091
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:50,673
If I was a cop, would I have busted
his shit? That's bleeding!

1092
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:51,995
Lock him in the car.

1093
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:53,635
Get him out of here.

1094
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:54,750
If I was a cop...

1095
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:56,155
Shut up!

1096
01:12:58,240 --> 01:12:59,832
My nose bleeding!

1097
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:01,269
Damn!

1098
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:02,989
You better tell us the truth.

1099
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:05,879
He's a cop.

1100
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:08,750
He hijacked the truck. This is a setup.

1101
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:11,952
If I was a cop, FBls would be
in here right now, man...

1102
01:13:12,160 --> 01:13:13,559
...taking everybody to jail!

1103
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,319
I think...

1104
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:18,432
...I have an idea.

1105
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:26,552
You wanna prove you aren't a cop?

1106
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:30,230
You say he's lying.

1107
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:32,755
Damn right.

1108
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:34,109
Shoot him.

1109
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:36,719
Shoot him.

1110
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:38,235
No problem.

1111
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:41,396
You son of a bitch!

1112
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:42,999
I meant, kill him.

1113
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:47,273
You didn't say that.
You just said, "Shoot him. "

1114
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:50,317
You wanna prove you aren't a cop?

1115
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:53,039
Kill him.

1116
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:58,276
There ain't no coming back for him.

1117
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:11,193
That's it. We're moving in.
All units, move in.

1118
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:12,916
Let's go!

1119
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:38,196
Shit!

1120
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:45,788
Give me the diamond or
I'll pop one in your ass!

1121
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,194
You had your chance.

1122
01:14:57,240 --> 01:14:58,309
Freeze! LAPD!

1123
01:14:58,520 --> 01:15:00,033
Show me your hands!

1124
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:05,836
Nice shot.

1125
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:12,156
Get out of the car! Turn around!

1126
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:21,836
Shit!

1127
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:03,637
All units, this is Agent Gray, FBI.

1128
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:06,752
We have no authority to pursue
the suspect beyond our border.

1129
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:08,911
<i>Do not cross into Mexico!</i>

1130
01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:33,392
Pursuit of suspect heading southbound.
We have an undercover officer onboard.

1131
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:36,194
I repeat: We have
a friendly onboard. Over!

1132
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:37,310
<i>Roger that!</i>

1133
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:47,715
Hold on!

1134
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,194
Shit!

1135
01:17:57,480 --> 01:17:58,833
Look out!

1136
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:12,911
Get him! I'm glad to see y'all!

1137
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:15,078
What you waiting for? Go!

1138
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:17,589
We can't, Malone.
We have no jurisdiction.

1139
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:20,155
Damn that! Damn the jurisdiction!
Go! Now!

1140
01:18:20,360 --> 01:18:22,590
We cannot cross into Mexico.

1141
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:23,716
- You can't?
- No.

1142
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:24,830
- You can't?
- No!

1143
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:26,268
Watch me.

1144
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:28,516
Believe that!

1145
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:31,438
Move your ass!

1146
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:56,919
Damn it! One bullet.

1147
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:08,755
Come on, Miles!

1148
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:15,556
Shit!

1149
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:52,319
- You're under arrest.
- What are you doing?

1150
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:54,795
I'm arresting you before they get here.

1151
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,116
I'll blow your head off
before they get here.

1152
01:19:58,440 --> 01:20:01,193
The way I see it
is you got 30 seconds...

1153
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:03,675
<i>...before they make
a piata out of you.</i>

1154
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:05,074
What are they talking about?

1155
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:08,430
Malone is an expert negotiator.

1156
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:09,789
He's an expert, sir.

1157
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:12,473
You got two choices.

1158
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:14,836
You can wind up somebody's bitch...

1159
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:16,679
<i>...or somebody's seorita.</i>

1160
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:18,598
Make up your mind. Your choice.

1161
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:21,713
I got three choices.
Maybe I just tell them who you are.

1162
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:25,674
You'll shut your mouth. Maybe
I'll cut you in on the diamond.

1163
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:29,789
Shithead, I got the goddamn diamond.

1164
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,956
Let me get that.
I'm your only way out!

1165
01:20:32,680 --> 01:20:34,079
Now, give me the gun.

1166
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:35,912
You don't wanna go to jail
in Mexico.

1167
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:40,193
Nobody wanna go to jail in Mexico.
They put burritos in your ass.

1168
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:41,276
Shut up!

1169
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:44,278
Come on, Deke. Give me the gun.
Come on!

1170
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:48,268
They think I'm a cop!
They think I'm a cop, man!

1171
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:50,397
I can help you, okay?

1172
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:53,438
You don't wanna die here.
Now give that up.

1173
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:56,518
If you screw me, I swear to God,
I'll come back for you.

1174
01:20:56,720 --> 01:20:58,312
I'll come back for you!

1175
01:20:58,600 --> 01:20:59,635
Give me the gun!

1176
01:21:02,120 --> 01:21:04,429
There you go.
Let me get that from you.

1177
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:06,677
Come on. Let it go.

1178
01:21:10,840 --> 01:21:12,592
There you go.

1179
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:19,673
This is gonna hurt a bit.

1180
01:21:22,280 --> 01:21:23,315
Holy Christ!

1181
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:27,996
That's for Eddie.

1182
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:35,039
You son of a bitch!

1183
01:21:35,240 --> 01:21:36,639
Come back here!

1184
01:21:36,920 --> 01:21:37,989
You son of a bitch!

1185
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:40,114
Miles, you die!

1186
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:14,668
You all right?

1187
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:17,795
I needed a vacation anyway, right?

1188
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:22,034
The FBI needs to talk to you,
Detective Malone.

1189
01:22:26,240 --> 01:22:29,789
Peterson, regional director, FBI.
We need to talk.

1190
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,036
Wait a minute. Slow down.

1191
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:34,037
No, lieutenant, I will not slow down.

1192
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:36,356
Is this man one of yours...

1193
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:38,439
...or not?

1194
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:41,679
You bet your ass he is.

1195
01:22:42,520 --> 01:22:45,239
Well, I'm gonna find out
what happened here...

1196
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:50,515
...even if it means putting your entire
department under federal review.

1197
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:54,478
Nice work.

1198
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:04,072
My office spent an hour talking to West
Covina and the U.S. Attorney's Office...

1199
01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:06,919
...trying to find out just
who it is you're working for.

1200
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:09,429
Now we know it's not the Bureau.

1201
01:23:09,640 --> 01:23:11,710
It's time that you
gave us an explanation.

1202
01:23:16,680 --> 01:23:18,113
<i>I'm a federale.</i>

1203
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:19,116
<i>A federale?</i>

1204
01:23:20,440 --> 01:23:22,874
Look across that border.
What do you see?

1205
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:26,271
That is the Democratic
Republic of Mexico.

1206
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:27,276
You're Mexican?

1207
01:23:27,480 --> 01:23:29,914
That's right.
On my mother's father's side.

1208
01:23:30,120 --> 01:23:31,075
I can see it.

1209
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:32,508
<i>Glacias. Thank you.</i>

1210
01:23:32,720 --> 01:23:35,029
Gentlemen, I shouldn't be
telling y'all this.

1211
01:23:35,240 --> 01:23:36,719
<i>I could lose my federale- hood.</i>

1212
01:23:36,920 --> 01:23:37,716
Your what?

1213
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:39,273
<i>My federale- hood!</i>

1214
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:42,556
Look, I had to throw you guys off, okay?

1215
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:44,592
I was doing it for my country.

1216
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:46,074
The red...

1217
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:47,874
...the white...

1218
01:23:48,680 --> 01:23:49,669
...and the green.

1219
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:54,112
If you'll excuse me,
I have to cross this border...

1220
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:57,312
<i>...and school some of my compadres,
you know...</i>

1221
01:23:57,520 --> 01:24:01,035
...on things we like to talk about.
So y'all stay up. Be cool.

1222
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:12,549
What's happening?
Hook a brother up with a taco!

1223
01:24:12,760 --> 01:24:14,273
A burrito!

1224
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:22,038
I can't believe so much bad shit
can happen on such a beautiful day.

1225
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:28,033
Yeah, what?

1226
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:30,112
I think your Spanish is a little rusty.

1227
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:33,630
You just told those men
you got a big cat in your pants.

1228
01:24:37,320 --> 01:24:40,517
<i>That's a Latin thing. Macho.
You wouldn't understand.</i>

1229
01:24:41,200 --> 01:24:43,555
No, I think I do understand...

1230
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:47,310
...Logan.

1231
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:48,396
What?

1232
01:24:51,480 --> 01:24:52,799
How'd you know it was me?

1233
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:54,831
I started thinking if I was Logan...

1234
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:59,238
...and had my diamond hidden
in a police building, what would I do?

1235
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:01,113
So I thought like a crook.

1236
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:02,919
Is that right?

1237
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:04,755
I don't believe this.

1238
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:06,837
He's a major felon.

1239
01:25:07,160 --> 01:25:09,549
This is one hell of a bust, Carlson.

1240
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:12,830
It's a hell of a bust for us.

1241
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:16,512
It's just too bad we can't make it.

1242
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:18,428
Say what?

1243
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:20,915
You heard the FBI.
They're extremely strict...

1244
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:24,749
...about pursuing suspects
across international borders.

1245
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:27,830
And you're just out of our jurisdiction.

1246
01:25:32,280 --> 01:25:33,349
You're...?

1247
01:25:34,240 --> 01:25:35,832
Exactly, because I'm across the...

1248
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:39,396
If I'm across the border and you're
over there, there's no way you...

1249
01:25:43,280 --> 01:25:45,191
I love this jurisdiction shit!

1250
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:50,673
I guess this is the last time
I'm gonna see you boys.

1251
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:54,354
But maybe we'll catch you later.

1252
01:25:54,720 --> 01:25:55,516
Is it like that?

1253
01:25:55,880 --> 01:25:57,279
Yeah. It's like that.

1254
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:10,036
Right there. Jurisdiction.

1255
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:14,316
Thanks.
