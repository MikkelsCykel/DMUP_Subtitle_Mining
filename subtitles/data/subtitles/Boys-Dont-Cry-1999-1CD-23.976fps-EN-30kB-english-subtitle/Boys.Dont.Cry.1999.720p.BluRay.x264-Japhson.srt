1
00:01:40,896 --> 00:01:42,981
- Shorter here.
- Shorter?

2
00:01:42,981 --> 00:01:45,067
- Shorter.
- That is short enough.

3
00:01:45,901 --> 00:01:47,652
OK, superstar?

4
00:01:48,195 --> 00:01:50,906
- Wow!
- What's with the shirt?

5
00:02:01,165 --> 00:02:05,753
That is the most frightenin' thing
I've ever seen. Looks like a deformity.

6
00:02:05,836 --> 00:02:07,838
I'll fix that.

7
00:02:10,216 --> 00:02:13,260
- Oh, God... yeah...
- That's better.

8
00:02:13,344 --> 00:02:16,597
Now, if you was a guy,
I might even wanna fuck you.

9
00:02:16,597 --> 00:02:20,142
You mean if you was a guy
you might even wanna fuck me.

10
00:02:20,225 --> 00:02:23,478
So you're a boy. Now what?

11
00:02:26,398 --> 00:02:27,023
Come on.

12
00:02:29,317 --> 00:02:31,194
No fuckin' way.

13
00:02:31,277 --> 00:02:33,363
Yes fuckin' way.

14
00:02:33,488 --> 00:02:36,699
- A joke is a joke.
- Come on, don't be a pussy.

15
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:38,576
I'm no pussy. Let's go home.

16
00:02:39,952 --> 00:02:42,747
- Someone's inside.
- You've got a date?

17
00:02:43,581 --> 00:02:45,166
I gotta go.

18
00:02:45,249 --> 00:02:47,251
Come here!

19
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:50,170
Can I talk to you just for a minute?

20
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:57,135
You look like a fuckin' idiot in that hat.

21
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:01,223
I'll be back. I'll be back.

22
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:02,766
Teena...

23
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,728
I don't want you comin' here

24
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,064
And wastin' all my time

25
00:03:27,164 --> 00:03:29,166
I don't mind you hangin' out

26
00:03:30,834 --> 00:03:32,794
And talkin' in your sleep

27
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:37,299
Yeah... athletic's nice.

28
00:03:37,382 --> 00:03:41,469
But the thing is he's sweet.
And good hair. That's important.

29
00:03:49,185 --> 00:03:51,688
I'm Billy. Are... are you Nicole?

30
00:03:53,022 --> 00:03:55,525
... and talkin' in your sleep

31
00:03:57,318 --> 00:03:58,986
I guess you're just what I needed

32
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:01,071
Just what I needed

33
00:04:01,155 --> 00:04:04,074
I needed someone to feed...

34
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:07,119
You don't seem like you're from around here.

35
00:04:08,787 --> 00:04:11,290
Where do I seem like I'm from?

36
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:15,544
Someplace beautiful.

37
00:04:32,226 --> 00:04:35,062
I'll stand right here until
you're safe inside, OK?

38
00:04:35,062 --> 00:04:36,605
OK.

39
00:04:50,077 --> 00:04:52,162
You're just what I needed

40
00:04:57,584 --> 00:04:59,544
You're just what I needed

41
00:05:05,299 --> 00:05:07,260
You're just what I needed

42
00:05:20,939 --> 00:05:22,274
You're not goin' anywhere!

43
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:24,693
Fucker!

44
00:05:25,527 --> 00:05:27,904
Get back here, you fucker!

45
00:05:31,157 --> 00:05:34,369
- You fuckin' dyke!
- You freak!

46
00:05:34,494 --> 00:05:38,540
- You fucked my sister!
- Open the fuckin' door, you fuckin' faggot!

47
00:05:38,665 --> 00:05:40,959
- Open the fuckin' door!
- Open this goddamn door!

48
00:05:41,042 --> 00:05:43,127
- You fuckin' asshole!
- Brothers!

49
00:05:43,252 --> 00:05:45,421
- I'll kick your fuckin' ass!
- Alicia.

50
00:05:45,546 --> 00:05:47,632
- Who is Alicia?
- You fuckin' dyke!

51
00:05:47,715 --> 00:05:50,426
- Damn, there's a lot of 'em!
- What have you done?!

52
00:05:50,551 --> 00:05:53,053
Your fuckin' faggot cousin, too!

53
00:05:53,137 --> 00:05:55,222
- Fuck!
- What is the matter with you?

54
00:05:55,347 --> 00:05:57,850
I don't know! I don't know what went wrong!

55
00:05:57,933 --> 00:06:01,270
You are not a boy! That is what
went wrong! You are not a boy!

56
00:06:01,395 --> 00:06:04,106
They say I'm the best
boyfriend they ever had.

57
00:06:04,106 --> 00:06:07,651
Do you want your mother to lock you up
again? Is that what you want?

58
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:09,194
No.

59
00:06:10,153 --> 00:06:13,698
Then why don't you just admit
that you're a dyke?

60
00:06:13,698 --> 00:06:15,158
Because I'm not a dyke.

61
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:16,826
Fucker!

62
00:06:19,537 --> 00:06:24,125
- What are you doin'? Get outta my pants.
- The money you owe me. I want it back.

63
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:25,793
Jesus!

64
00:06:27,044 --> 00:06:30,172
Careful with that.
You didn't have to do that. Jeez!

65
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:35,260
You're not crashin' here any more, Teena.
Get your stuff and go.

66
00:07:09,877 --> 00:07:11,545
Bad night?

67
00:07:14,381 --> 00:07:16,341
The worst.

68
00:07:32,523 --> 00:07:35,526
- So what's your name?
- Candace.

69
00:07:37,612 --> 00:07:41,073
I hate it, though. I'm thinkin' of changin' it.

70
00:07:41,073 --> 00:07:43,159
Sometimes that helps.

71
00:07:43,576 --> 00:07:45,035
I'm Brandon.

72
00:07:54,086 --> 00:07:56,379
I'll pay if you get 'em.

73
00:07:56,505 --> 00:07:58,798
- Sure.
- Marlboros.

74
00:07:58,882 --> 00:08:00,675
I'll be right back.

75
00:08:08,891 --> 00:08:11,102
Check this out.

76
00:08:12,353 --> 00:08:14,021
My friend's sittin' there.

77
00:08:14,021 --> 00:08:15,773
So?

78
00:08:18,275 --> 00:08:19,652
I said get off.

79
00:08:19,735 --> 00:08:25,074
Excuse me. Why don't you leave the lady
alone? I don't want any trouble here.

80
00:08:27,993 --> 00:08:30,495
You gotta be kiddin' me.

81
00:08:30,495 --> 00:08:33,832
I didn't ask you what you wanted,
you little fag.

82
00:08:44,259 --> 00:08:46,969
You fucker! You motherfucker!

83
00:08:47,053 --> 00:08:49,764
- I'll kick your white hick ass!
- Hold on, cowboy.

84
00:08:50,097 --> 00:08:52,892
Can't I leave you alone for five minutes?

85
00:08:53,017 --> 00:08:55,936
You fuck! I'm gonna get your ass!

86
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:01,233
Come on, stud. You got us into this.

87
00:09:01,358 --> 00:09:03,318
Fucker!

88
00:09:14,704 --> 00:09:17,207
Oh, shit. Cops, man.

89
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:20,126
They suck.

90
00:09:21,377 --> 00:09:24,922
I would've had those guys
if you wouldn't have stopped me.

91
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:28,467
Oh, my God! John, look.

92
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:33,347
You're gonna have a shiner in the mornin'.

93
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:35,432
- I am?
- Yeah.

94
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:37,643
Oh, shit!

95
00:09:37,726 --> 00:09:40,979
- You got a light, man?
- Oh, yeah, here.

96
00:09:47,319 --> 00:09:49,321
You have got the tiniest hands.

97
00:09:49,321 --> 00:09:52,323
No. They're big.

98
00:09:52,657 --> 00:09:56,494
- Joe Louis had tiny hands.
- He didn't throw punches without defence.

99
00:09:57,036 --> 00:10:00,456
If you're gonna get into fights
over girls, learn a few moves.

100
00:10:03,292 --> 00:10:05,253
Come on.

101
00:10:11,842 --> 00:10:14,428
- Hey, pussy.
- Fuck you, man!

102
00:10:14,553 --> 00:10:17,139
- Tom, this is Brandon.
- Hey.

103
00:10:17,473 --> 00:10:21,727
John. We'll give you a ride home,
as soon as we find the goddamn car!

104
00:10:21,852 --> 00:10:25,063
Sorry! It's up here somewhere!

105
00:10:25,397 --> 00:10:27,691
We're goin' to a party. You wanna come?

106
00:10:27,774 --> 00:10:30,402
Candace, it's 70 miles away.

107
00:10:30,693 --> 00:10:35,281
I don't care. I mean, the night
is young and... and I am a mess, so...

108
00:10:42,288 --> 00:10:43,748
Good.

109
00:11:04,601 --> 00:11:07,187
Are we there yet?

110
00:11:07,312 --> 00:11:12,525
It's just up ahead... unless you wanna stop
at a roadhouse and get in another fight.

111
00:11:44,931 --> 00:11:47,976
I don't know where the fuck I am.

112
00:11:52,355 --> 00:11:54,440
Falls City?

113
00:11:54,523 --> 00:11:58,069
What are you doin' down there?
That's not even on the map.

114
00:11:58,194 --> 00:11:59,653
Oh, fuck!

115
00:11:59,653 --> 00:12:02,031
Lonny, my life is a fuckin' nightmare.

116
00:12:02,156 --> 00:12:07,035
I got this big court date next week
and I don't got anywhere to stay.

117
00:12:07,161 --> 00:12:11,415
If I don't make it, I'm fucked.
Can I just stay at your house?

118
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,708
- What about those doctors?
- I went.

119
00:12:13,834 --> 00:12:18,004
It's insane. You gotta see shrinks,
shoot hormones up your butt,

120
00:12:18,088 --> 00:12:22,800
and it costs a fuckin' fortune. I'll be
an old man before I get that kinda money.

121
00:12:22,884 --> 00:12:24,552
You gotta do somethin'.

122
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:28,431
You can't just keep runnin',
because you'll end up in jail.

123
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:30,516
For ever.

124
00:12:33,102 --> 00:12:35,187
You really think I can do it?

125
00:12:35,312 --> 00:12:37,189
You're the butch.

126
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:39,358
Now come straight to my house.

127
00:12:39,483 --> 00:12:42,403
No stoppin' in bars, no stealin'...

128
00:12:42,486 --> 00:12:45,739
- And no more girls.
- No more girls.

129
00:12:47,699 --> 00:12:50,118
- No more girls.
- Hey, handsome.

130
00:12:51,578 --> 00:12:53,955
- Sleep all right?
- Yeah.

131
00:12:55,749 --> 00:12:57,625
Candace.

132
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:59,711
I remember.

133
00:12:59,711 --> 00:13:01,671
- This is Cody.
- Cody.

134
00:13:01,796 --> 00:13:03,548
Wow! Beautiful.

135
00:13:03,673 --> 00:13:05,967
You still broodin' over your fiancée?

136
00:13:06,259 --> 00:13:07,218
What?

137
00:13:07,218 --> 00:13:10,137
Oh. It's a real long story.

138
00:13:11,806 --> 00:13:13,974
God, you're really good with kids.

139
00:13:14,308 --> 00:13:16,685
Yeah... I got one of my own.

140
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,322
Hey, Brandon! Good news.

141
00:13:30,574 --> 00:13:32,534
- I got you a ride.
- All right!

142
00:13:32,659 --> 00:13:36,496
- He's goin' to Lincoln later tonight.
- Oh, wow!

143
00:13:37,747 --> 00:13:39,749
Cool.

144
00:13:59,977 --> 00:14:01,937
You suck!

145
00:14:03,397 --> 00:14:05,273
- Hey, champ!
- Hey!

146
00:14:05,398 --> 00:14:08,526
Tom only dates girls
with a little butt and a long crack,

147
00:14:08,526 --> 00:14:12,697
right up to the small of the back.
That's how he picks 'em.

148
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:16,868
Tom likes 'em coyote ugly.
You know coyote ugly?

149
00:14:16,868 --> 00:14:19,245
I'm all over some booty!

150
00:14:21,872 --> 00:14:23,332
Thank you.

151
00:14:27,378 --> 00:14:32,508
- Looks like you're ridin' with Ted Bundy.
- Shut up, John. He looks fine, right?

152
00:14:32,591 --> 00:14:34,885
Yeah, just like family.

153
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:37,304
- Speakin' of.
- Hey, where's Lana?

154
00:14:37,304 --> 00:14:39,806
We were gonna go on, but she wandered off.

155
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:41,892
You got time to stick around, right?

156
00:14:41,975 --> 00:14:46,062
These girls get their shit together,
they're gonna do some karaoke.

157
00:14:50,108 --> 00:14:52,527
Lana! Where you been?

158
00:14:54,904 --> 00:14:57,740
Come on, Lana. Let's go on already.

159
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:00,117
Lana, it was your idea!

160
00:15:06,081 --> 00:15:08,375
Who are you?

161
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:47,579
The lonesome Texas sun

162
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,082
Was settin' slow

163
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:56,213
And in the rear-view mirror

164
00:15:56,338 --> 00:15:58,298
I watched it go

165
00:16:01,551 --> 00:16:03,094
Shut the fuck up!

166
00:16:04,053 --> 00:16:06,222
In her golden hair

167
00:16:09,267 --> 00:16:12,395
I close my eyes for a moment

168
00:16:12,603 --> 00:16:14,980
I'm still there

169
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,819
The bluest eyes in Texas

170
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:24,907
Are hauntin' me tonight

171
00:16:28,243 --> 00:16:30,120
Another town

172
00:16:30,203 --> 00:16:33,248
Another hotel room

173
00:16:36,584 --> 00:16:42,090
Another dream that ended way too soon

174
00:16:45,134 --> 00:16:47,011
Left me lonely

175
00:16:47,094 --> 00:16:50,556
Prayin' for the dawn

176
00:16:53,893 --> 00:16:59,940
Searchin' for the strength to carry on

177
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:05,153
The bluest eyes in Texas

178
00:17:06,071 --> 00:17:08,907
Are hauntin' me tonight

179
00:17:10,367 --> 00:17:13,495
Like the stars that fill...

180
00:17:28,926 --> 00:17:31,929
What the fuck...?
You were gonna be five minutes!

181
00:17:32,054 --> 00:17:36,850
- We got stuck in time warp!
- Jesus, get in the car already.

182
00:17:46,026 --> 00:17:49,571
- Brandon, come with us.
- He's a psycho killer, anyways.

183
00:17:49,654 --> 00:17:52,574
- Crash with me again.
- One more night, Tyson!

184
00:17:54,033 --> 00:17:56,035
Come on, buddy.

185
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:14,803
Like I was sayin'...
I get to the house, you know?

186
00:18:14,803 --> 00:18:17,806
My sister was totally naked
and totally on fire. Right, John?

187
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:21,476
- Tom was like "Where's my camera?"
- You saved everyone?

188
00:18:21,476 --> 00:18:25,647
Oh, yeah. Tom's a big hero.
He rescued everybody. Right, dickwad?

189
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:30,860
So when they brought me in, they said "This
is the biggest fire we've seen in 50 years!"

190
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:34,822
"You're a hero, man!" And I was like "Yeah?"
And they were like "Yeah".

191
00:18:34,906 --> 00:18:37,950
That's why they put me in
all them Lincoln newspapers.

192
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:40,036
- Probably seen me.
- That's cool.

193
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:44,498
- What the hell is that?
- Bumper-skiing, man.

194
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,211
Thank you.

195
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:54,633
Flippin' burgers. That's for squares, man.

196
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:57,552
Give me real work,
like in the oilfields or somethin'.

197
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:00,555
I wanna be a smoke jumper
out in Mount St Helens.

198
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,808
You know, fightin' fires,
makin' lots of money,

199
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:08,062
and then travellin' all around:
Memphis, Graceland, Tennessee...

200
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:12,567
You dick. Graceland is in Memphis
and Memphis is in Tennessee.

201
00:19:15,361 --> 00:19:17,863
I know.

202
00:19:21,534 --> 00:19:24,036
- Maybe you've had enough.
- I ain't had any.

203
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:29,958
No shit, man. People like you, you don't need
drugs. You just hallucinate 24 hours a day.

204
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:42,679
All right, Tom, you're up.

205
00:19:42,804 --> 00:19:44,681
Not me, man. I'm drinkin'.

206
00:19:45,932 --> 00:19:47,892
Brandon, that means you.

207
00:19:48,017 --> 00:19:51,562
- Yeah, stud! Let's go, cowboy!
- Come on, you can do it.

208
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:58,861
Brandon is a mean prizefighter from Lincoln.

209
00:19:58,944 --> 00:20:01,989
Be careful what you say to him.
Tough. Very tough.

210
00:20:02,072 --> 00:20:04,283
Don't let 'em scare ya. You can do it.

211
00:20:24,302 --> 00:20:25,553
Freak!

212
00:20:27,013 --> 00:20:29,098
Come on!

213
00:20:35,771 --> 00:20:38,065
You can do better than that!

214
00:20:41,401 --> 00:20:43,278
One more time.

215
00:20:43,278 --> 00:20:45,572
John, come on. Stop it, John.

216
00:20:45,656 --> 00:20:47,866
Oh, OK, OK.

217
00:20:54,122 --> 00:20:55,790
- Take it easy.
- I'm fine.

218
00:20:55,874 --> 00:21:00,586
Yeah, you're fine. You're fucked up,
you know? You are one crazy little fucker.

219
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:03,506
- What are we goin' to do with you?
- Man, it's nothin'.

220
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:07,760
Wait, where are we goin'?
Wait, I'll drive!

221
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:33,592
There's a diamond

222
00:22:33,592 --> 00:22:35,886
In her eye

223
00:22:35,969 --> 00:22:38,180
It's a-shinin'

224
00:22:38,263 --> 00:22:40,265
Up above

225
00:22:42,767 --> 00:22:45,061
And the moon

226
00:22:45,061 --> 00:22:47,147
In the sky

227
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:49,232
Say you want it

228
00:22:49,315 --> 00:22:51,317
Tell her why

229
00:22:58,699 --> 00:23:00,701
Where gamblers

230
00:23:00,785 --> 00:23:02,995
Tell you lies

231
00:23:02,995 --> 00:23:05,164
She'll take a tumble

232
00:23:05,289 --> 00:23:07,249
And never lose

233
00:23:09,751 --> 00:23:12,045
And in the mornin'

234
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:14,131
She'll wear a smile

235
00:23:14,256 --> 00:23:16,216
She's made of stars

236
00:23:16,341 --> 00:23:17,884
Oh, hi.

237
00:23:20,387 --> 00:23:22,389
You sell, uh...

238
00:23:22,389 --> 00:23:25,725
- Ruffles?
- Ruffles. Right over there.

239
00:23:25,808 --> 00:23:27,810
Thank you.

240
00:23:41,657 --> 00:23:43,534
Dream on, Lana.

241
00:23:44,076 --> 00:23:47,287
- I can't be sellin' you no beer tonight.
- Fine. I'll browse.

242
00:23:51,666 --> 00:23:54,294
The beer's in the back if you want it.

243
00:24:03,052 --> 00:24:04,512
Hey.

244
00:24:04,595 --> 00:24:07,098
Space cowboy!

245
00:24:08,683 --> 00:24:12,311
I'm so wasted. I don't know
if I'm ever gonna come down.

246
00:24:12,436 --> 00:24:14,814
- That's OK.
- I need beer.

247
00:24:14,939 --> 00:24:17,858
Come here.

248
00:24:17,942 --> 00:24:19,943
It's OK. It's OK.

249
00:24:24,531 --> 00:24:27,034
It's OK. Here.

250
00:24:27,034 --> 00:24:29,619
- It's for me.
- Can I see some ID?

251
00:24:29,744 --> 00:24:30,871
Sure.

252
00:24:30,996 --> 00:24:32,664
How beautiful!

253
00:24:32,664 --> 00:24:36,626
Jesus Christ, I feel like I'm on acid.
It's like an album cover.

254
00:24:38,795 --> 00:24:41,214
Would you, uh... care to join me?

255
00:24:42,674 --> 00:24:44,967
- Come on.
- Fuck off!

256
00:24:45,051 --> 00:24:49,138
Don't you talk to me like that,
you skanky little snake.

257
00:24:51,432 --> 00:24:52,975
Kwik Stop.

258
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:57,980
Hey! Lana!

259
00:24:58,313 --> 00:25:01,233
Lana, wait. I'll drive you. I got Candace's car.

260
00:25:01,316 --> 00:25:03,193
I'm walkin'.

261
00:25:03,318 --> 00:25:05,278
Well, here.

262
00:25:07,989 --> 00:25:10,825
What are you still hangin' around here for?

263
00:25:10,825 --> 00:25:14,996
Well, I thought someone oughta
walk you home before you get an MIP.

264
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:17,582
I don't need anybody to walk me anywhere.

265
00:25:20,626 --> 00:25:23,963
- Jeez, watch it.
- I don't need you to stop me from trippin'.

266
00:25:24,046 --> 00:25:26,882
Lana, you are one cranky girl.

267
00:25:28,217 --> 00:25:32,179
You'd be cranky, too, Mr I'm-Going-
To-Memphis-Graceland-Tennessee,

268
00:25:32,304 --> 00:25:37,518
if you were stuck where there's nothin'
to do but go bumper-skiing and chase bats.

269
00:25:37,518 --> 00:25:40,103
Hey, I've been bored my whole life.

270
00:25:41,063 --> 00:25:46,067
Is that why you let John tie you to the back
of a truck and drag you around like a dog?

271
00:25:46,151 --> 00:25:49,612
No. I just thought that's
what guys do around here.

272
00:25:54,701 --> 00:25:58,162
Wait a minute. What's your name again?

273
00:25:58,996 --> 00:26:01,082
Brandon.

274
00:26:04,627 --> 00:26:06,921
The discs... took off from here.

275
00:26:09,632 --> 00:26:11,925
That's all there is. Let's go back.

276
00:26:14,219 --> 00:26:16,388
Lana? Lana?

277
00:26:19,099 --> 00:26:21,393
Look, just go on home, OK?

278
00:26:24,646 --> 00:26:27,148
God, I hate my life.

279
00:26:27,148 --> 00:26:29,234
Lana?

280
00:26:30,568 --> 00:26:32,779
I hate your life, too.

281
00:26:33,696 --> 00:26:38,200
- Don't look at my stupid house.
- I'm not lookin' at your stupid house.

282
00:26:38,284 --> 00:26:40,286
I'm lookin' at you.

283
00:26:45,499 --> 00:26:47,459
What was I thinkin'?

284
00:26:51,213 --> 00:26:53,215
Mom... come on.

285
00:26:54,675 --> 00:26:56,635
Come on!

286
00:26:57,177 --> 00:26:59,262
Did you eat?

287
00:27:02,891 --> 00:27:05,101
It's all right.

288
00:27:07,604 --> 00:27:09,564
Don't. It's OK.

289
00:27:14,902 --> 00:27:18,864
Hi. Here, drink this.
You'll feel better in the mornin'.

290
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:21,158
Come on.

291
00:27:36,464 --> 00:27:38,550
It's good for ya.

292
00:27:40,135 --> 00:27:42,846
Yeah, I got a thing for cow.

293
00:27:43,346 --> 00:27:45,431
I know a song about cows.

294
00:27:46,057 --> 00:27:49,936
- My dad taught it to me.
- You're not gonna sing it for me, are ya?

295
00:27:50,019 --> 00:27:53,481
No. I can't sing to save my life.

296
00:27:54,315 --> 00:27:56,901
- Me neither.
- What?

297
00:27:57,026 --> 00:27:59,737
Sure you can. You sing great.

298
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,905
That wasn't me. It was the karaoke.

299
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,533
So?

300
00:28:04,616 --> 00:28:06,702
You were still great.

301
00:28:06,827 --> 00:28:08,495
I couldn't do it.

302
00:28:08,578 --> 00:28:10,789
A lot of people I know couldn't.

303
00:28:49,242 --> 00:28:51,536
You don't know any songs about cows?

304
00:28:54,164 --> 00:28:56,124
Sure I do.

305
00:29:08,219 --> 00:29:13,974
Comin' to you this beautiful Friday,
October 27 th, this is Corn Report.

306
00:29:13,974 --> 00:29:18,645
It is 8am. It is 45 degrees.
You'd better watch out. That winter is comin'.

307
00:29:24,067 --> 00:29:25,527
Hey.

308
00:29:25,652 --> 00:29:27,737
Is it always this nice in the mornin'?

309
00:29:27,821 --> 00:29:30,240
I made you a little breakfast.

310
00:29:31,574 --> 00:29:33,576
Wow!

311
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:38,247
Thank you.

312
00:29:44,837 --> 00:29:46,505
My hand sucks.

313
00:29:46,589 --> 00:29:49,216
How come Aunt Lana's asleep?

314
00:29:49,216 --> 00:29:55,138
Well, your Aunt Lana is a nice girl, but
she is as lazy as the day is long, sweetheart.

315
00:29:55,264 --> 00:29:57,557
Don't you be like that, OK? Huh?

316
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:02,145
- Answer if somebody asks a question.
- How are things with her mother?

317
00:30:02,229 --> 00:30:04,439
She gave me April for a couple of days.

318
00:30:06,608 --> 00:30:09,652
I love this song! Yes! Yes!

319
00:30:09,652 --> 00:30:13,197
- Who's that lady?
- Who's that lady?

320
00:30:13,197 --> 00:30:14,449
Who's that lady?

321
00:30:14,532 --> 00:30:16,534
A real, real, real fine lady

322
00:30:16,617 --> 00:30:17,785
Beautiful lady

323
00:30:17,869 --> 00:30:22,248
I wish somebody would introduce her to me

324
00:30:22,373 --> 00:30:24,667
Oh, get up. Dance with me.

325
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:26,961
Come on. Get up.

326
00:30:26,961 --> 00:30:28,629
I didn't get a chance

327
00:30:28,712 --> 00:30:30,089
I asked her to dance

328
00:30:30,172 --> 00:30:31,965
Asked her to dance

329
00:30:32,049 --> 00:30:34,343
It was love at first sight...

330
00:30:34,676 --> 00:30:36,636
April... come here.

331
00:30:39,055 --> 00:30:41,016
Jesus, turn down the goddamn music!

332
00:30:45,103 --> 00:30:48,439
- Come on, honey. Loosen up.
- No, let me go, let me go.

333
00:30:49,982 --> 00:30:54,070
You motherfuckers!
Why did they let you fuckheads outta jail?

334
00:31:20,011 --> 00:31:24,098
Belly is cravin', I got a shakin' in my head

335
00:31:24,933 --> 00:31:29,729
I feel like I'm dyin' and I wish I was dead

336
00:31:29,812 --> 00:31:34,942
If I live till tomorrow, that'd be a long time.

337
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:40,364
I'll reel and I'll fall, but I'll rise on cod'ine.

338
00:31:41,907 --> 00:31:44,201
You'll forget you're a woman

339
00:31:44,326 --> 00:31:46,703
You'll forget about men

340
00:31:47,246 --> 00:31:51,708
Try it just once and you'll try it again

341
00:31:52,667 --> 00:31:54,753
You'll forget about life

342
00:31:54,753 --> 00:31:57,547
You'll forget about time

343
00:31:57,672 --> 00:32:02,677
And live all your days a slave to cod'ine

344
00:32:02,677 --> 00:32:07,056
And it's real, oh, it's real

345
00:32:07,139 --> 00:32:09,976
One more time

346
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:17,066
And some of them fall

347
00:32:17,566 --> 00:32:20,611
And rise on cod'ine

348
00:32:25,407 --> 00:32:27,284
I'm an asshole.

349
00:32:29,786 --> 00:32:30,912
What?

350
00:32:31,037 --> 00:32:32,289
Blowout.

351
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:35,834
- What happened?
- Aw, I'm in the doghouse again.

352
00:32:35,834 --> 00:32:38,211
- I've been there my whole life.
- Women, right?

353
00:32:38,336 --> 00:32:40,004
Yeah.

354
00:32:41,255 --> 00:32:45,718
- You gonna do a little damage control?
- And then you'll fuck it up again.

355
00:32:45,843 --> 00:32:48,429
Come on. Oh, my goodness!

356
00:32:48,554 --> 00:32:51,765
Hey... who are you? What's your name, huh?

357
00:32:51,891 --> 00:32:54,184
- April.
- April?

358
00:32:54,184 --> 00:32:57,187
- How'd you get such a pretty name?
- My daddy.

359
00:32:57,312 --> 00:32:59,606
Yeah, that's true. I named her.

360
00:32:59,898 --> 00:33:01,900
- Where are you goin'?
- See Lana.

361
00:33:01,984 --> 00:33:03,985
All right. Go on.

362
00:33:07,113 --> 00:33:09,199
Got an extra cig, man?

363
00:33:11,701 --> 00:33:13,036
Thanks, man.

364
00:33:13,578 --> 00:33:16,497
Is, uh... is she Lana's?

365
00:33:17,332 --> 00:33:18,875
Lana's? No.

366
00:33:19,834 --> 00:33:23,671
No, I had April with a different girl. Mallory.

367
00:33:24,088 --> 00:33:28,384
This here's my real family,
even if it isn't my real home, you know?

368
00:33:28,801 --> 00:33:30,678
I mean...

369
00:33:31,178 --> 00:33:32,846
Lana...

370
00:33:33,389 --> 00:33:36,099
I don't know. It's kinda hard to explain.

371
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:43,398
Well, I got 12 more like this at home.
I keep it in a secret place.

372
00:33:44,649 --> 00:33:47,861
She wrote to me when I was in lockup.

373
00:33:47,986 --> 00:33:50,155
- Lana did?
- Yup. She wrote to me.

374
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:54,325
Even my own mom didn't
write to me. But she did.

375
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:57,995
Lana and her mom. They took me in.

376
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,000
Fuck. Fucker.

377
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,588
- Brandon, honey, where are your folks from?
- I'm from Lincoln.

378
00:34:07,671 --> 00:34:11,133
But my dad's out in Memphis right now,

379
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,218
and my mom's in Hollywood.

380
00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:14,970
- Hollywood?
- Yeah.

381
00:34:15,095 --> 00:34:18,432
- Oh, wow!
- Yeah. My sister's a model.

382
00:34:18,515 --> 00:34:20,934
- That's glamorous!
- Hey, Brandon,

383
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:24,270
- Why don't you clean these ashtrays for us?
- Fuck you!

384
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:26,231
I'm just playin' with you, bud.

385
00:34:26,356 --> 00:34:28,733
Brandon, honey, come here.

386
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:31,444
Over here. Closer, where I can see you.

387
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:34,488
Let me look at you in the light. Come on.

388
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:36,574
Come on.

389
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,702
Come here. Let me.

390
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:44,915
I can believe you got a model for a sister.

391
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:47,918
You're like a little movie star yourself.

392
00:34:57,302 --> 00:34:59,929
Hey, April. Want a beer?

393
00:35:00,013 --> 00:35:03,475
Hey! What the fuck are you doin'?

394
00:35:03,558 --> 00:35:06,811
Here you go, hon. Here you go.
Have some of Daddy's.

395
00:35:06,811 --> 00:35:09,313
Come on. Come on. Little bit.

396
00:35:09,397 --> 00:35:15,236
Four years ago, you wouldn't have thought
he could take care of himself, let alone a kid.

397
00:35:15,361 --> 00:35:19,406
Shit, four years ago you wouldn't
have been able to talk to him.

398
00:35:19,532 --> 00:35:21,075
Prison?

399
00:35:22,242 --> 00:35:25,454
And her mother! Jesus Christ!

400
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:28,707
And this one...

401
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:33,712
- This one kept that boy's spirit alive.
- Mom, just forget about that.

402
00:35:37,549 --> 00:35:41,427
The little bastard pissed on me!
She hasn't had the proper trainin'!

403
00:35:41,511 --> 00:35:45,807
- Your mother's an asshole, you know that?
- John, she had an accident.

404
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:49,769
It's OK, sweetie. It's not your fault.

405
00:35:53,606 --> 00:35:54,982
Havin' fun?

406
00:35:55,691 --> 00:35:57,693
Yeah.

407
00:35:57,776 --> 00:36:01,530
- What do you think of my mom? Weird, huh?
- No, I like her.

408
00:36:02,489 --> 00:36:04,575
I think she's funny.

409
00:36:04,658 --> 00:36:08,203
- Are you for real?
- Excuse me. Am I interruptin' somethin'?

410
00:36:08,328 --> 00:36:11,957
Take a picture of me and my daughter.
Lana's dad gave us that.

411
00:36:12,082 --> 00:36:16,252
- I don't feel like havin' my picture taken.
- Come on, honey. Just one.

412
00:36:16,252 --> 00:36:17,795
Come on, son.

413
00:36:20,006 --> 00:36:22,508
Well... refill time.

414
00:36:22,592 --> 00:36:24,802
Bring it in when you're ready, OK?

415
00:36:32,309 --> 00:36:34,603
Here, look. It's not bad, huh?

416
00:36:36,355 --> 00:36:37,940
What?

417
00:36:39,066 --> 00:36:42,110
- No.
- Why not? You're beautiful.

418
00:36:43,236 --> 00:36:45,238
Come over here.

419
00:36:54,205 --> 00:36:57,208
I had a dream about you last night.

420
00:36:57,333 --> 00:37:00,128
You did? What happened?

421
00:37:02,004 --> 00:37:04,215
Come on, tell me the dream.

422
00:37:05,758 --> 00:37:09,845
Someone walked me home
last night. I think it was you.

423
00:37:13,182 --> 00:37:15,267
No fair!

424
00:37:23,066 --> 00:37:25,568
Lana! It's time to go to work!

425
00:37:30,907 --> 00:37:35,078
John, you're too fucked up.
Why don't you let Brandon drive?

426
00:37:36,621 --> 00:37:39,123
Hey. Here you go, little buddy.

427
00:37:40,791 --> 00:37:42,793
You all right?

428
00:37:43,294 --> 00:37:45,296
Tom!

429
00:38:01,228 --> 00:38:04,356
Nice car.
Why don't you turn down your radio?

430
00:38:04,481 --> 00:38:06,441
Yeah, totally.

431
00:38:08,109 --> 00:38:11,362
- What the fuck are you lookin' at?
- Wall people.

432
00:38:11,362 --> 00:38:13,739
- What the fuck did you say?
- Wall people.

433
00:38:13,865 --> 00:38:15,950
Let me outta this fuckin' car!

434
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:18,661
Bite me, you fuckin' fudgepacker!

435
00:38:18,661 --> 00:38:21,163
- Eat me.
- Fuck you!

436
00:38:24,083 --> 00:38:26,585
- Go after 'em!
- Step on it!

437
00:38:38,263 --> 00:38:39,931
Go! Come on, go!

438
00:38:39,931 --> 00:38:43,351
Come on, pussy. Go faster, you cocksucker.

439
00:38:45,853 --> 00:38:48,064
Come on, Brandon! Go!

440
00:38:58,782 --> 00:39:01,201
Go, Brandon!

441
00:39:21,638 --> 00:39:25,600
Oh, no, it's the man!
Fuck! It's the piggers!

442
00:39:25,683 --> 00:39:28,519
Come on, these cops are onto us.
What the fuck...?

443
00:39:30,896 --> 00:39:32,982
Don't stop, don't stop. Go faster.

444
00:39:34,024 --> 00:39:36,443
- Brandon...
- Go faster.

445
00:39:38,195 --> 00:39:40,197
Brandon, stop.

446
00:39:41,115 --> 00:39:44,993
That's it, that's it.
They ain't got no fuckin' balls.

447
00:39:52,375 --> 00:39:55,211
When you hit the gravel, drop to 40.

448
00:40:08,015 --> 00:40:09,266
I can't see.

449
00:40:13,854 --> 00:40:17,941
That's OK. Neither can he. You're flyin'.

450
00:40:54,309 --> 00:40:56,311
Take it out.

451
00:41:01,149 --> 00:41:04,069
Get off me, dick. I wasn't doin' anythin'.

452
00:41:04,152 --> 00:41:06,863
Goin' awful fast back there, Mr Brayman.

453
00:41:06,988 --> 00:41:10,533
- Tell me what you're doin' in Falls City.
- Just visitin', sir.

454
00:41:10,617 --> 00:41:12,911
Yeah? Where are you stayin'?

455
00:41:16,998 --> 00:41:19,083
He's stayin' with me.

456
00:41:25,214 --> 00:41:28,050
I can't run a check on this.
Our computers are down.

457
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:30,427
But I could run you all in right now.

458
00:41:33,972 --> 00:41:37,726
You could let these guys go.
They ain't got anythin' to do with it.

459
00:41:37,851 --> 00:41:40,145
I got a little carried away back there.

460
00:41:40,228 --> 00:41:44,733
- We don't got anythin' like this in Lincoln.
- A dustless highway?

461
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:49,821
Only one in Nebraska.
That's a hundred-foot drop.

462
00:41:52,657 --> 00:41:55,785
- I won't lock you up, but you get a ticket.
- OK.

463
00:41:55,785 --> 00:41:59,538
Those are residential streets
back there, so you slow down.

464
00:41:59,622 --> 00:42:02,458
- Do you read me, Mr Brayman?
- Absolutely, sir.

465
00:42:03,083 --> 00:42:06,211
Did you see this ID?
That's pretty slick: Charles Brayman.

466
00:42:06,295 --> 00:42:09,006
I let you down. I'm sorry.

467
00:42:09,131 --> 00:42:12,884
Man, don't worry. We'll take you
to the tunnel, chase some bats.

468
00:42:12,968 --> 00:42:16,430
Yeah... it's like the tunnel of love.

469
00:42:16,513 --> 00:42:18,932
God, Candace, would you get a grip?

470
00:42:19,015 --> 00:42:22,894
- Is that your real birthday?
- No. November 10th, '72.

471
00:42:22,977 --> 00:42:26,105
Hey, that's next week. Let's have a party.

472
00:42:26,231 --> 00:42:29,025
21! You're gonna be a man!

473
00:42:30,193 --> 00:42:31,652
Shit.

474
00:42:33,196 --> 00:42:35,698
Don't you never pull that shit again.

475
00:42:37,158 --> 00:42:40,703
- What?
- You heard. Don't never pull that shit again.

476
00:42:40,828 --> 00:42:43,747
You got me stopped by the fuckin' cops.

477
00:42:43,831 --> 00:42:48,418
Why... But you're the one
who told me to race after 'em.

478
00:42:48,544 --> 00:42:51,046
I had you in the clear and you fucked up.

479
00:42:53,548 --> 00:42:56,676
John, it's over. Don't get upset.

480
00:42:59,387 --> 00:43:01,973
I'm not upset.

481
00:43:02,098 --> 00:43:04,183
You almost got us killed.

482
00:43:07,728 --> 00:43:12,108
- I almost got us killed?
- Whoo! Brandon...

483
00:43:12,191 --> 00:43:16,278
- You led us 90mph into a cloud of dust.
- Brandon...

484
00:43:16,362 --> 00:43:20,866
- We were about to go off a 400-foot ravine.
- Shit! Fuck!

485
00:43:21,492 --> 00:43:23,577
- Get outta my goddamn car.
- All right...

486
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:26,079
Get outta my motherfuckin' car!

487
00:43:26,163 --> 00:43:30,250
- Get outta my goddamn motherfuckin' car!
- Shit! Get off me, you sick fuck!

488
00:43:30,333 --> 00:43:35,130
Get outta my goddamn motherfuckin'
shit-eatin' cocksuckin' car!

489
00:43:35,255 --> 00:43:37,215
Get out!

490
00:43:42,011 --> 00:43:43,888
- Not you.
- Fuck you!

491
00:44:11,831 --> 00:44:14,125
Welcome to the psycho ward.

492
00:44:25,303 --> 00:44:27,888
Come on, Kate. He's takin' us to work.

493
00:44:28,639 --> 00:44:31,433
You know, Tom set that fire hisself.

494
00:44:48,033 --> 00:44:49,993
That's my car!

495
00:44:53,955 --> 00:44:56,791
Doctors say he ain't got no impulse control.

496
00:44:59,168 --> 00:45:01,879
I'm the only one who can control that fucker.

497
00:45:05,216 --> 00:45:08,886
Come on. We'll walk you home, Candace.

498
00:45:12,639 --> 00:45:14,600
You ever try this?

499
00:45:17,227 --> 00:45:20,856
Tom, did you set your own
family's house on fire?

500
00:45:27,862 --> 00:45:30,365
What about this?

501
00:45:30,365 --> 00:45:32,450
You ever do this?

502
00:45:35,369 --> 00:45:37,246
What the fuck, Tom?

503
00:45:38,497 --> 00:45:41,000
Some people punch holes in walls.

504
00:45:42,042 --> 00:45:45,170
This... helps snap me back into reality.

505
00:45:45,254 --> 00:45:49,967
Gets a control of this thing inside of me,
so I don't... lash out at someone.

506
00:45:52,344 --> 00:45:56,723
Me and John used to do it
to ourselves all the time in lockup.

507
00:45:56,848 --> 00:46:00,268
I could always go deeper than him.
He was such a wuss.

508
00:46:08,735 --> 00:46:10,194
Try it.

509
00:46:18,619 --> 00:46:21,247
I guess I am a pussy, compared to you.

510
00:46:28,629 --> 00:46:30,922
I'm just jokin' with you, man.

511
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,672
Fuck!

512
00:47:14,839 --> 00:47:16,508
Fuck!

513
00:47:33,899 --> 00:47:36,318
Brandon... hey.

514
00:47:37,861 --> 00:47:42,157
- Lana.
- I'm so sorry. I just had to see someone nice.

515
00:47:42,241 --> 00:47:45,160
I just got off work.
I'm havin' a nervous breakdown.

516
00:47:45,285 --> 00:47:47,662
Just a minute. I have to pee, OK?

517
00:47:53,001 --> 00:47:56,546
God, I was scared to death that
Candace was gonna catch me.

518
00:47:56,629 --> 00:48:01,134
She's obsessed with findin' a husband.
You're her favourite candidate.

519
00:48:01,217 --> 00:48:04,971
I can't believe you worked last night.
You must be exhausted.

520
00:48:05,096 --> 00:48:10,309
Me neither. I do it all the time, though.
You don't have to be sober to weigh spinach.

521
00:48:12,061 --> 00:48:14,271
Thanks for the coffee.

522
00:48:18,734 --> 00:48:21,153
I'm crashin' really hard, though.

523
00:48:22,696 --> 00:48:27,200
l, um... have to go back to Lincoln
to take care of some stuff.

524
00:48:29,703 --> 00:48:32,705
- You really leavin'?
- Yeah.

525
00:48:32,831 --> 00:48:35,833
Are you gonna see your sister? The model?

526
00:48:36,584 --> 00:48:38,336
Yeah.

527
00:48:39,796 --> 00:48:41,380
Nicole?

528
00:48:42,423 --> 00:48:45,009
She's pretty. Is she gonna be there?

529
00:48:45,134 --> 00:48:49,597
Yeah. Now that she's married,
we're gonna be takin' off any second.

530
00:48:52,099 --> 00:48:57,104
So... where are you goin'
on your big trip outta here?

531
00:49:00,982 --> 00:49:05,570
I don't know.
I guess it's not all worked out yet.

532
00:49:05,654 --> 00:49:08,072
That's OK.

533
00:49:10,658 --> 00:49:13,786
Thanks for givin' your address to the cops.

534
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:17,540
It was nothin'.

535
00:49:25,881 --> 00:49:27,758
I might hitchhike.

536
00:49:27,883 --> 00:49:30,385
Really? I've never done that.

537
00:49:31,512 --> 00:49:33,513
Me neither.

538
00:49:39,561 --> 00:49:41,229
Well...

539
00:49:44,566 --> 00:49:47,986
This might sound really stupid, but, um,

540
00:49:48,111 --> 00:49:51,864
do you think there's anywhere
I could make money doin' karaoke?

541
00:49:51,864 --> 00:49:56,661
Why not? People make money
doin' all sorts of things.

542
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:04,043
Did you really write letters to him in prison?

543
00:50:06,045 --> 00:50:08,547
Gimme a break. I was 13 years old.

544
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:11,466
Who told you that? My mom?

545
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:14,177
He did.

546
00:50:36,157 --> 00:50:38,159
You better go.

547
00:50:51,296 --> 00:50:54,925
That rusty nail over our front door

548
00:50:55,967 --> 00:50:59,429
Is where I hung our tears in a ring

549
00:51:00,889 --> 00:51:05,351
I threw that horseshoe into the wheat

550
00:51:06,102 --> 00:51:09,939
To see what love can bring

551
00:51:10,898 --> 00:51:15,361
Cos you're in your bed and I'm in mine

552
00:51:15,903 --> 00:51:19,865
On either side of town

553
00:51:20,991 --> 00:51:24,870
I think I might take a ride...

554
00:51:36,214 --> 00:51:38,424
Please... Please don't get mad.

555
00:51:41,761 --> 00:51:45,097
One night. One night and I'm gone.

556
00:51:47,183 --> 00:51:49,560
They're not gonna lock me up, are they?

557
00:51:49,977 --> 00:51:54,773
Teena, how the fuck do I know what they're
gonna do? I'm sick of watchin' you fuck up.

558
00:51:54,898 --> 00:51:59,069
But... but I'm not fuckin' up.
It is so good down there, Lonny.

559
00:51:59,069 --> 00:52:03,532
In Falls City? They hang faggots
down there. Did you know that?

560
00:52:03,657 --> 00:52:06,159
You've never even been there. Look.

561
00:52:07,827 --> 00:52:10,205
Look. See, isn't she beautiful?

562
00:52:11,247 --> 00:52:13,666
If you like white trash.

563
00:52:13,666 --> 00:52:15,752
I'm gonna ask her to marry me.

564
00:52:17,837 --> 00:52:22,425
Before or after your sex-change operation?
Before or after you tell her you're a girl?

565
00:52:22,425 --> 00:52:24,093
Shut up!

566
00:52:24,093 --> 00:52:26,887
It's... it's different. It's workin'.

567
00:52:27,221 --> 00:52:30,641
I'm not gonna fuck it up this time.

568
00:52:33,268 --> 00:52:35,437
I hope they do lock you up tomorrow.

569
00:52:37,648 --> 00:52:42,944
Keith Pierce, for spray-paintin' and
smashin' 50 new cars, you are sentenced

570
00:52:43,069 --> 00:52:46,614
to six months at the
juvenile detention centre.

571
00:52:47,323 --> 00:52:49,325
Teena Brandon.

572
00:52:51,619 --> 00:52:55,039
Teena Brandon, docket 72391.

573
00:52:59,627 --> 00:53:04,632
Teena Brandon, docket 7 2391,
grand theft auto.

574
00:53:58,350 --> 00:54:00,852
Psst! Lana! Down here!

575
00:54:02,312 --> 00:54:05,648
Brandon! Where'd you get that?

576
00:54:06,149 --> 00:54:08,151
Nice hat.

577
00:54:12,196 --> 00:54:14,490
I gotta go. My break's almost over.

578
00:54:31,923 --> 00:54:34,634
It all looks so different from the outside.

579
00:54:52,151 --> 00:54:54,236
Oh, you're so pretty.

580
00:55:24,682 --> 00:55:26,976
I feel like I'm in a trance.

581
00:55:31,147 --> 00:55:33,107
Am I goin' too fast?

582
00:57:08,531 --> 00:57:11,451
I cannot wear these. They make me look fat.

583
00:57:11,868 --> 00:57:13,953
Quit changin' the subject.

584
00:57:15,204 --> 00:57:17,707
I saved your ass at work.
Now tell us what's goin' on.

585
00:57:17,790 --> 00:57:21,043
Yeah, I bet Brandon doesn't think you're fat.

586
00:57:21,127 --> 00:57:25,714
- Nobody looks fat when they're layin' down.
- I knew it! I fuckin' knew it!

587
00:57:30,636 --> 00:57:34,389
- We just drove around, takin' pictures.
- Yeah, right.

588
00:57:57,536 --> 00:58:01,290
Oh, I cannot talk about it!
It's too intense.

589
00:58:01,373 --> 00:58:04,209
Come on, Lana! I can't take it!

590
00:58:53,006 --> 00:58:54,966
Are you OK?

591
00:58:56,968 --> 00:58:58,011
Yeah.

592
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:06,561
Are you OK?

593
00:59:07,186 --> 00:59:08,938
Yeah.

594
00:59:09,063 --> 00:59:12,191
I mean, uh... I don't know.

595
00:59:42,011 --> 00:59:44,305
You're so handsome.

596
01:00:02,864 --> 01:00:05,992
And then we took off our clothes
and went swimmin'.

597
01:00:12,457 --> 01:00:14,751
Don't be scared, Brandon.

598
01:00:22,466 --> 01:00:24,427
But did you do it?

599
01:00:24,552 --> 01:00:26,512
What do you think?

600
01:00:43,820 --> 01:00:48,116
- What did you wish for?
- I know what he wished for. Yeah, baby!

601
01:00:48,199 --> 01:00:51,035
Oh, Mom, don't talk so gross!

602
01:00:55,081 --> 01:00:58,751
- Happy birthday.
- You shouldn't have, really.

603
01:01:06,467 --> 01:01:08,761
Keepin' me strong, Mom?

604
01:01:09,052 --> 01:01:10,929
Happy birthday, sweetheart.

605
01:01:11,054 --> 01:01:14,057
- Thank you, Mom.
- Sorry, I forgot mine.

606
01:01:16,268 --> 01:01:19,479
- That's OK.
- I haven't wrapped mine yet.

607
01:01:21,356 --> 01:01:23,650
- Hey, grease monkey.
- How ya doin'?

608
01:01:23,775 --> 01:01:27,195
We were doin' a job in Omaha.
We could've used a lookout.

609
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:37,204
John Lotter, I know your mother, and
I know she taught you how to knock.

610
01:01:37,329 --> 01:01:41,083
We could've been lyin' around
here naked, for all you know.

611
01:01:41,166 --> 01:01:42,835
- Where's Lana?
- In her room.

612
01:01:43,252 --> 01:01:48,173
Come on, get a beer, John.
It's Brandon's birthday. Sit with us.

613
01:01:56,806 --> 01:01:58,808
Hey, gorgeous.

614
01:01:59,517 --> 01:02:01,519
Walk right in, why don't you?

615
01:02:01,603 --> 01:02:06,107
- I'm busy fixin' my hair.
- Your hair's beautiful. I love your hair.

616
01:02:08,901 --> 01:02:12,154
- I got this for you up in Omaha.
- Cool.

617
01:02:14,949 --> 01:02:18,285
Tom and I went up to Lincoln
for a couple of days.

618
01:02:18,911 --> 01:02:20,704
Stealin' cars?

619
01:02:27,461 --> 01:02:31,214
I came by the factory before we left
and you weren't there.

620
01:02:32,257 --> 01:02:34,259
So?

621
01:02:36,845 --> 01:02:38,847
Nice.

622
01:02:45,186 --> 01:02:48,105
- Don't get upset. I just wanna talk.
- About what?

623
01:02:48,230 --> 01:02:51,650
About you and Brandon.
I'm just lookin' out for ya.

624
01:02:51,776 --> 01:02:55,195
What are you talkin' about?
He's your friend, too.

625
01:02:58,657 --> 01:03:00,742
I miss you.

626
01:03:00,826 --> 01:03:03,328
- I do.
- Stop it, John. You give me the creeps.

627
01:03:03,453 --> 01:03:06,581
- You're like a stalker.
- Fuck you!

628
01:03:09,292 --> 01:03:12,295
- No. No. Fuck you.
- John, I'm sorry.

629
01:03:12,420 --> 01:03:14,798
I just need some privacy right now.

630
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:17,634
Yeah.

631
01:03:17,717 --> 01:03:20,136
You know I just wanna protect you.

632
01:03:21,471 --> 01:03:23,764
I know.

633
01:03:23,890 --> 01:03:26,392
No one's ever protected me like you.

634
01:03:32,106 --> 01:03:34,191
What do you see in him?

635
01:03:34,817 --> 01:03:38,278
I know he's nice and everythin',
but he's kind of a wuss.

636
01:03:38,779 --> 01:03:43,075
I know he's no big he-man, like you.
There's just somethin' about him.

637
01:03:43,492 --> 01:03:47,245
Oh, yeah.
"There's just somethin' about him"!

638
01:03:47,329 --> 01:03:49,414
Stop makin' fun of me!

639
01:03:53,376 --> 01:03:57,130
- Lana, honey, are you fuckin' him?
- Goddamn it, John!

640
01:03:57,255 --> 01:03:59,841
- It's none of your fuckin' business!
- You are!

641
01:03:59,966 --> 01:04:03,177
Excuse me. Did I interrupt somethin'?

642
01:04:05,679 --> 01:04:07,681
Lana, are you OK?

643
01:04:08,307 --> 01:04:10,476
Don't even think about it, John.

644
01:04:16,648 --> 01:04:20,902
- John, let's hit the road, man.
- No. It's Brandon's birthday.

645
01:04:24,239 --> 01:04:26,533
She's beautiful, isn't she?

646
01:04:27,158 --> 01:04:30,620
Oh, man. I've known her
since she was like this high.

647
01:04:31,871 --> 01:04:34,373
I could tell you stories about her.

648
01:04:35,625 --> 01:04:38,127
You know what kind of stories?

649
01:04:41,255 --> 01:04:43,424
She told me about you guys.

650
01:04:47,177 --> 01:04:52,599
And I can't think of a better guy to give
Lana to than you, so happy birthday!

651
01:04:55,102 --> 01:04:57,104
Thanks, John.

652
01:04:59,064 --> 01:05:05,111
You know, just one thing you gotta
remember, little man, is this is my house.

653
01:05:09,824 --> 01:05:11,784
Come on, turn up the music!

654
01:05:12,827 --> 01:05:14,829
Turn up the music!

655
01:06:00,581 --> 01:06:02,166
I quit.

656
01:06:02,249 --> 01:06:04,751
- Quit what?
- My evil job.

657
01:06:06,336 --> 01:06:10,382
I've just been thinkin' and thinkin',
what am I doin' here?

658
01:06:10,382 --> 01:06:13,927
And then it came to me...
I'll go to Memphis with you.

659
01:06:14,052 --> 01:06:17,180
- Memphis?
- I got it all figured out.

660
01:06:17,263 --> 01:06:20,308
You're right.
I'll make money singin' karaoke...

661
01:06:20,391 --> 01:06:22,810
- Lana...
- You'll manage me,

662
01:06:22,894 --> 01:06:26,647
and, if I'm no good, you'll sing
and I'll manage you. Perfect.

663
01:06:30,192 --> 01:06:32,611
Nothin' can go wrong if we're together.

664
01:06:33,529 --> 01:06:39,159
Lana, um... it's a little more complicated
than that, you know? Memphis is far.

665
01:06:39,284 --> 01:06:42,412
It's 1,327 miles.

666
01:06:43,247 --> 01:06:44,998
Yeah,

667
01:06:45,123 --> 01:06:47,709
but, you know, I been thinkin'.

668
01:06:48,251 --> 01:06:52,922
We could just start our own trailer park
right here in Falls City.

669
01:06:56,259 --> 01:07:00,221
- You don't wanna go with me?
- No! Of course I do!

670
01:07:00,346 --> 01:07:02,849
That's the point. I'll marry you right now.

671
01:07:04,308 --> 01:07:06,602
Oh, Lana... you're in trouble again.

672
01:07:08,354 --> 01:07:12,107
Actually, that ain't Lana's, it's mine.
I'll take care of it.

673
01:07:12,233 --> 01:07:14,526
I just got my first paycheck.

674
01:07:15,235 --> 01:07:17,529
Come on, now. You go sit down.

675
01:07:17,654 --> 01:07:19,531
- OK.
- I'll bring your breakfast.

676
01:07:21,283 --> 01:07:25,162
The thing about the trailer park
is we'll have picnic tables

677
01:07:25,245 --> 01:07:29,124
and people playin' music,
and barbecues every night.

678
01:07:29,207 --> 01:07:32,877
We'll invite our friends:
Candace, Kate, your mom.

679
01:07:32,961 --> 01:07:36,714
Heck, even John,
if you two don't kill each other first.

680
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:42,261
And best of all, we'll have our own Airstream.

681
01:07:53,730 --> 01:07:57,150
If that's a hassle, you could
mail the receipt to my house.

682
01:07:57,276 --> 01:08:01,238
That's all right. I'll just be
a moment. I'll be right back.

683
01:08:08,203 --> 01:08:10,413
Just one second.

684
01:08:11,748 --> 01:08:13,750
It's slow.

685
01:08:19,589 --> 01:08:21,549
Miss Brandon?

686
01:08:26,345 --> 01:08:31,141
Miss Brandon, we put your Charles Brayman
ID number through the computer yesterday,

687
01:08:31,266 --> 01:08:35,437
and this is what the Lincoln
authorities faxed us over.

688
01:08:42,402 --> 01:08:44,404
You tell me.

689
01:08:46,281 --> 01:08:47,824
Wow.

690
01:08:47,949 --> 01:08:50,952
This Teena chick seems pretty messed up.

691
01:08:55,039 --> 01:08:56,916
What the hell is this?

692
01:09:00,044 --> 01:09:04,006
- Who wrote this?
- That guy who stayed with you. Brandon.

693
01:09:51,635 --> 01:09:54,679
Dear Lonny, I bet you can't guess where I am.

694
01:09:55,722 --> 01:09:58,433
That's right, back in jail, in Falls City.

695
01:10:00,185 --> 01:10:02,186
I'm so tired of fuckin' up.

696
01:10:02,270 --> 01:10:07,400
I'm tryin' to stay strong, but I don't know
if I can face all the mistakes I've made.

697
01:10:18,952 --> 01:10:20,954
I'm stayin' tough.

698
01:10:30,005 --> 01:10:31,256
No!

699
01:10:51,192 --> 01:10:54,403
Candace... why do you look so funny?

700
01:11:10,168 --> 01:11:12,754
Lana! Lana, what are you doin' here?

701
01:11:14,839 --> 01:11:16,841
What are you doin' here?

702
01:11:16,924 --> 01:11:18,926
The girls' cell?

703
01:11:19,010 --> 01:11:22,555
This place is crazy.
It's, like, put you wherever they want.

704
01:11:22,555 --> 01:11:25,057
It's fine with me, I guess, but...

705
01:11:25,599 --> 01:11:30,479
Julie, give us a break, man. Watch
the rest of the show. Tell us how it ends.

706
01:11:33,816 --> 01:11:36,109
We only got three channels. I hate it.

707
01:11:36,652 --> 01:11:38,320
Brandon, what's goin' on?

708
01:11:39,655 --> 01:11:42,157
You want the truth, don't ya?

709
01:11:44,034 --> 01:11:47,162
It sounds a lot more complicated than it is.

710
01:11:49,789 --> 01:11:54,377
Do you have any water?
Cos I'm really... My voice is... dry.

711
01:12:00,216 --> 01:12:02,301
I'm a hermaphrodite.

712
01:12:02,385 --> 01:12:03,552
What?

713
01:12:03,636 --> 01:12:05,638
Come here.

714
01:12:08,557 --> 01:12:13,020
It's a person who has both...
girl and boy parts.

715
01:12:13,854 --> 01:12:16,356
Brandon's real name is Teena Brandon.

716
01:12:18,024 --> 01:12:20,944
Well, see, Brandon's not quite a he.

717
01:12:21,987 --> 01:12:25,865
- Brandon's more like a sh...
- Shut up. It's your business.

718
01:12:25,949 --> 01:12:30,953
Look, I don't care if you're half monkey
or half ape. I'm gettin' you outta here.

719
01:12:57,229 --> 01:12:59,439
I would say I'm sorry

720
01:12:59,522 --> 01:13:03,067
If I thought that it would change your mind

721
01:13:03,193 --> 01:13:04,861
But I know that this time...

722
01:13:04,944 --> 01:13:07,155
Candace,

723
01:13:07,238 --> 01:13:09,532
I spoke to Lana's mom.

724
01:13:10,700 --> 01:13:12,660
She's missin'.

725
01:13:12,785 --> 01:13:15,913
- You know where she is?
- I don't know. I swear.

726
01:13:15,996 --> 01:13:19,333
Candace, if you know anythin',
you better tell me now.

727
01:13:19,458 --> 01:13:21,627
You know what?

728
01:13:21,627 --> 01:13:25,297
I already opened my big mouth,
and now no one's talkin' to me.

729
01:13:25,380 --> 01:13:27,466
Candace, I'm talkin' to ya.

730
01:13:35,599 --> 01:13:38,018
Either I'm fucked up,

731
01:13:38,101 --> 01:13:41,020
or something's totally weird.

732
01:13:42,063 --> 01:13:45,525
Come on, Kandi. You can tell me.
I won't tell anybody.

733
01:13:47,193 --> 01:13:49,779
- I need more to drink.
- There you go.

734
01:13:50,196 --> 01:13:51,989
I try to laugh about it

735
01:13:52,073 --> 01:13:55,534
Hidin' the tears in my eyes, cos

736
01:13:56,368 --> 01:13:59,580
Boys don't cry

737
01:14:01,165 --> 01:14:06,378
Boys don't cry

738
01:14:07,212 --> 01:14:10,215
I would tell you that I loved you

739
01:14:10,340 --> 01:14:13,343
If I thought that you would stay

740
01:14:13,468 --> 01:14:16,387
But I know that it's no use

741
01:14:16,471 --> 01:14:19,182
You already gone away

742
01:14:19,933 --> 01:14:21,893
Missed out your limits

743
01:14:22,935 --> 01:14:24,604
Pushed you too far

744
01:14:25,980 --> 01:14:27,940
Took you for granted...

745
01:14:36,281 --> 01:14:40,661
Goddamn it! I wanna touch you
the way you touch me.

746
01:14:42,871 --> 01:14:44,956
No. Wait.

747
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:47,125
Fuck you, Brandon!

748
01:14:47,250 --> 01:14:49,210
Fuck you!

749
01:14:49,336 --> 01:14:51,421
I want you to feel what I feel.

750
01:14:55,258 --> 01:14:57,760
Lana, wait. Wait.

751
01:15:00,054 --> 01:15:02,265
Soon. I promise.

752
01:15:05,685 --> 01:15:08,104
- Is she back yet?
- No, and I'm worried.

753
01:15:08,187 --> 01:15:11,523
- Come on, let's just go find Lana.
- He'll show up.

754
01:15:11,649 --> 01:15:14,568
Kate, I want you to tell me what's goin' on.

755
01:15:14,985 --> 01:15:16,737
Mom, you read the paper today?

756
01:15:17,362 --> 01:15:19,239
- No.
- Candace, show Mom the paper.

757
01:15:19,239 --> 01:15:22,909
- John, you promised.
- Come on. Is Lana your friend or not?

758
01:15:22,993 --> 01:15:25,078
Just gimme that, honey.

759

"Teena Brandon, 19,
picked up on a speeding violation."

760
01:15:29,999 --> 01:15:31,876
So? Brandon got a ticket.

761
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:33,962
The name, Mom. The name.

762
01:15:39,258 --> 01:15:41,677
He's brainwashed her. That's what they do.

763
01:15:41,761 --> 01:15:45,723
Get out! There's nothin' in Lana's room.
John, leave her stuff alone.

764
01:15:45,848 --> 01:15:50,853
I'm not touchin' her stuff! If you were any
kind of mother, this wouldn't have happened.

765
01:15:50,936 --> 01:15:54,606
- I told you you couldn't trust him.
- You never told me anythin'.

766
01:15:54,690 --> 01:15:57,734
Come on, Kate, you got to stop this.

767
01:15:57,818 --> 01:16:03,031
Like you wouldn't jump in if it wasn't
totally obvious you're in love with Brandon!

768
01:16:06,159 --> 01:16:09,621
Holy fuckin' mother of fuck!
Tom, check this out.

769
01:16:12,832 --> 01:16:16,586

"Sexual identity crisis."

771
01:16:19,630 --> 01:16:23,467
Jesus fuckin' Christ, Tom,
check this out... OK, look at this.

"The grafted skin will mimic
the skin of the natural penis."

773
01:16:26,929 --> 01:16:29,223
Get this sick shit away from me!

774
01:16:29,306 --> 01:16:31,308
Just give it a minute, OK?

775
01:16:32,225 --> 01:16:34,644
She's gotta think I was at work.

776
01:16:35,145 --> 01:16:37,147
OK.

777
01:16:37,564 --> 01:16:39,524
But I'll miss you.

778
01:17:02,046 --> 01:17:04,548
- Whoa!
- Thank God you're home.

779
01:17:05,090 --> 01:17:07,259
Did you party all night without me?

780
01:17:07,384 --> 01:17:08,844
Come on in, have a beer.

781
01:17:08,927 --> 01:17:14,141
Look, I gotta take a shower. I don't mean
to be antisocial, but I'm really tired, guys.

782
01:17:14,266 --> 01:17:18,228
- How was work, Lana?
- Oh, you know, whatever, Mom. The usual.

783
01:17:22,065 --> 01:17:24,692
Mom, what the hell's goin' on?

784
01:17:26,861 --> 01:17:29,155
God, what did you tell them?

785
01:17:29,780 --> 01:17:33,034
We called work. We know you weren't there.

786
01:17:33,117 --> 01:17:37,621
Why is he talkin' to me?
What are you? My dad?

787
01:17:39,373 --> 01:17:41,875
Why are you all starin' at me?

788
01:17:42,918 --> 01:17:47,297
Get away! You're gross! You're
horrible people! Get outta my room!

789
01:17:47,297 --> 01:17:49,925
We're worried. We're just tryin' to save you.

790
01:17:50,217 --> 01:17:52,093
You got a sick way of showin' it.

791
01:17:52,219 --> 01:17:55,430
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey... Oh, my God!

792
01:17:57,098 --> 01:18:00,143
Brandon, turn around and go, now.
This is a nuthouse.

793
01:18:00,226 --> 01:18:02,937
- I'm just worried about you.
- Stop with that!

794
01:18:03,062 --> 01:18:06,274
- We just need to talk.
- What do you need to talk about?

795
01:18:06,399 --> 01:18:08,985
There are some things I don't understand.

796
01:18:09,110 --> 01:18:13,572
You took a leak with me and... pardon my
French, Mom, but... you shook off your dick.

797
01:18:13,572 --> 01:18:17,326
And what was that bullshit
about payin' child support for a kid?

798
01:18:17,451 --> 01:18:21,830
- You been lyin' since you came into town.
- No...

799
01:18:21,914 --> 01:18:25,167
When you rode in on your
pussy-whipped faggot horse.

800
01:18:25,250 --> 01:18:29,546
The fact is, little dude,
you're nothin' but a goddamn liar.

801
01:18:29,629 --> 01:18:31,423
You know what we do to liars?

802
01:18:31,506 --> 01:18:33,925
There was never any Memphis, was there?

803
01:18:34,217 --> 01:18:37,679
We're totally fuckin' with you! Seriously!

804
01:18:39,013 --> 01:18:41,015
Go get Brandon a beer.

805
01:18:42,558 --> 01:18:46,437
We were wonderin' about this paper
that you are in, Teena.

806
01:18:52,568 --> 01:18:55,195
It's our ticket. They're hungry for news here.

807
01:18:55,279 --> 01:18:58,949
Yeah, but what I'm
wonderin' about is the name.

808
01:19:00,409 --> 01:19:03,328
Huh, Brandon? I mean, huh, Teena?

809
01:19:03,411 --> 01:19:05,288
I really fucked up.

810
01:19:05,413 --> 01:19:09,584
I borrowed one of Candace's cheques
and I got that ticket and this fake ID.

811
01:19:09,667 --> 01:19:12,086
I guess I just need to learn to stay home.

812
01:19:12,170 --> 01:19:17,091
Brandon, I invite you into my home and
you expose my daughter to your sickness.

813
01:19:17,175 --> 01:19:21,345
- Did you ever think about Lana?
- That's all I've been thinkin' about.

814
01:19:21,470 --> 01:19:25,015
You know, Lana, if you are a lesbian,
you just need to tell me.

815
01:19:25,099 --> 01:19:28,852
- John, I'm not. Mom, it's not...
- Stop it. It's not Lana. It's me.

816
01:19:28,978 --> 01:19:33,982
Lana, I'm so sorry. Mom, wait, I can explain.
We can work this out. I have this thing...

817
01:19:34,066 --> 01:19:37,110
You fuckin' pervert.
Are you a girl or are you not?

818
01:19:37,194 --> 01:19:39,071
Are you a girl or are you not?

819
01:19:39,196 --> 01:19:41,364
There's a real easy way to solve this.

820
01:19:41,490 --> 01:19:44,284
- Fuck you! Get the fuck off of me.
- You want a fight?

821
01:19:44,409 --> 01:19:48,872
- Get out of here with your sick psycho brain!
- I could kill you for lyin' to Lana.

822
01:19:48,997 --> 01:19:52,750
John, there's not gonna be
any killin' goin' on, OK?

823
01:19:55,128 --> 01:20:00,132
Do you trust me enough to let
Brandon show me?  Then I'll tell you.

824
01:20:01,217 --> 01:20:03,219
Do you trust me enough?

825
01:20:06,430 --> 01:20:08,223
OK, John?

826
01:20:09,266 --> 01:20:11,226
Yeah.

827
01:20:12,269 --> 01:20:13,937
OK.

828
01:20:14,062 --> 01:20:16,022
Thank you, guys.

829
01:20:18,108 --> 01:20:19,901
Fuck me!

830
01:20:19,985 --> 01:20:21,987
Holy fuck!

831
01:20:22,821 --> 01:20:25,114
Get over here. I'm so sorry, Brandon.

832
01:20:25,198 --> 01:20:27,283
Lana... I gotta explain.

833
01:20:27,408 --> 01:20:31,245
Oh, no, no, no. Button up your pants.
Don't show me anythin'.

834
01:20:32,205 --> 01:20:34,081
Think about it.

835
01:20:34,165 --> 01:20:36,042
I know you're a guy.

836
01:20:36,042 --> 01:20:41,046
OK, but you gotta listen. I was born
with this weirdness, like a birth defect.

837
01:20:41,171 --> 01:20:44,925
It's actually not that rare,
but these doctors are tryin' to fix it.

838
01:20:45,008 --> 01:20:47,219
But I have really weird stuff, too.

839
01:20:48,679 --> 01:20:50,639
Don't be scared.

840
01:20:51,890 --> 01:20:53,975
Look how beautiful it is out there.

841
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:57,520
- Oh, Lana...
- That's us. We can beam ourselves out there.

842
01:21:00,857 --> 01:21:03,067
So what are you gonna tell 'em?

843
01:21:03,151 --> 01:21:05,987
I'm gonna tell 'em what they wanna hear.

844
01:21:06,279 --> 01:21:09,115
I'm gonna tell 'em what we know is true.

845
01:21:21,293 --> 01:21:23,295
Mom,

846
01:21:24,630 --> 01:21:26,923
I seen him in the full flesh.

847
01:21:27,674 --> 01:21:29,843
I seen it.

848
01:21:29,968 --> 01:21:31,928
I know he's a man.

849
01:21:32,888 --> 01:21:35,682
Problem done. Now let's go to bed.

850
01:21:37,475 --> 01:21:39,769
Son of a bitch!
What have you done to my baby?

851
01:21:39,853 --> 01:21:42,480
What the fuck are you, you motherfucker?!

852
01:21:42,563 --> 01:21:44,023
Huh?

853
01:21:44,649 --> 01:21:46,442
Tell me!

854
01:21:52,990 --> 01:21:54,992
You little liar.

855
01:21:55,618 --> 01:21:57,494
Kate, get her outta here.

856
01:21:57,578 --> 01:21:59,580
Come on.

857
01:22:04,459 --> 01:22:07,379
All I need is the truth, little buddy. Come on.

858
01:22:10,215 --> 01:22:13,426
All right... I'm sorry to put you
through this. Wait...

859
01:22:13,635 --> 01:22:15,512
- Unstrap his belt.
- I'll do it!

860
01:22:15,637 --> 01:22:18,640
Tom, just turn the light off. I'll do it! Please!

861
01:22:18,640 --> 01:22:20,725
Fuck! John, let me the fuck go!

862
01:22:20,850 --> 01:22:24,604
What's goin' on in there? Open the door!

863
01:22:27,106 --> 01:22:29,066
Open the fuckin' door!

864
01:22:33,153 --> 01:22:35,531
- John, please! Please!
- What do you see?

865
01:22:35,656 --> 01:22:38,158
If it's down here, it's the tiniest I ever saw!

866
01:22:38,242 --> 01:22:42,621
- Touch it.
- Oh, goddamn it, I can't! God, I can't do it!

867
01:22:42,621 --> 01:22:44,623
What the fuck are you?!

868
01:22:44,706 --> 01:22:46,791
Come on. Come on. Come on.

869
01:22:47,626 --> 01:22:49,836
Let me go! John, let me go!

870
01:22:53,798 --> 01:22:55,758
Open the door!

871
01:22:59,095 --> 01:23:02,014
Don't look like no sexual identity crisis to me.

872
01:23:05,351 --> 01:23:07,770
- Open the door!
- Get in here.

873
01:23:09,521 --> 01:23:12,441
Look at your little boyfriend.
Look at your little boyfriend.

874
01:23:16,111 --> 01:23:19,114
Come on, I'm holdin' you until you look.

875
01:23:19,239 --> 01:23:20,782
Look!

876
01:23:20,782 --> 01:23:22,659
Leave him alone!

877
01:23:39,050 --> 01:23:41,635
- Leave him alone!
- Him?

878
01:23:41,761 --> 01:23:43,721
Him?!

879
01:23:45,097 --> 01:23:47,683
- Get outta my house!
- John, we called the cops.

880
01:23:47,808 --> 01:23:51,353
- Go on. Get out.
- You are just too fucked up!

881
01:23:52,062 --> 01:23:54,356
Leave us alone!

882
01:23:54,481 --> 01:23:59,569
- Leave me alone. Please, just leave me alone!
- You promised... You promised...

883
01:24:15,209 --> 01:24:18,045
I guess that's everythin'.

884
01:24:18,754 --> 01:24:23,467
You know, I told Brandon...
that nobody has a right to do that to you.

885
01:24:25,636 --> 01:24:28,972
Come on, we've done everythin' we can.
Let's get outta here.

886
01:24:29,181 --> 01:24:31,808
- Let's go.
- I'm waitin' for Brandon.

887
01:24:33,060 --> 01:24:36,188
Your mom's right.
Until this is straightened out,

888
01:24:36,271 --> 01:24:40,650
it'd be better for everyone
if Brandon stays someplace else.

889
01:24:40,775 --> 01:24:44,737
What are you talkin' about?
lt'd be better to lock up Tom and John.

890
01:24:44,821 --> 01:24:48,282
Lana, everythin' Teena told us was lies.

891
01:24:48,366 --> 01:24:50,660
Everythin'. Everythin'.

892
01:24:52,536 --> 01:24:54,747
We need to go.

893
01:24:54,830 --> 01:24:56,832
Now.

894
01:24:56,916 --> 01:24:58,918
Come on!

895
01:24:59,001 --> 01:25:01,003
Come on. Get up!

896
01:25:02,546 --> 01:25:05,674
I'm askin' you this
because if this goes to court

897
01:25:05,799 --> 01:25:09,970
that question's gonna come up
and I'm gonna want an answer.

898
01:25:10,595 --> 01:25:12,139
Uh, I don't know why I have to...

899
01:25:12,264 --> 01:25:14,224
All right, let's back up.

900
01:25:14,349 --> 01:25:17,685
After they pulled your pants down
and seen you was a girl,

901
01:25:18,186 --> 01:25:21,231
what did he do? Did he fondle you any?

902
01:25:27,361 --> 01:25:29,363
No.

903
01:25:39,873 --> 01:25:42,709
Didn't that kinda get
your attention somehow?

904
01:25:44,253 --> 01:25:49,049
That he wouldn't put his hand in your pants
and just play with you a little bit?

905
01:25:51,051 --> 01:25:52,594
I don't know what he did.

906
01:26:01,978 --> 01:26:04,063
Let's go. Come on.

907
01:26:05,856 --> 01:26:09,610
Let's go, buddy.
Come on, let's go for a ride. Move!

908
01:26:13,155 --> 01:26:17,409
I can't believe that he pulled your pants
down, and if you are a female,

909
01:26:17,534 --> 01:26:21,079
that he didn't stick
his hand in ya or his finger in ya.

910
01:26:22,122 --> 01:26:23,457
Well, he didn't.

911
01:26:40,139 --> 01:26:42,141
Get outta the car.

912
01:26:42,225 --> 01:26:44,518
Get outta the car. Come on.

913
01:26:47,021 --> 01:26:49,106
- John...
- Shut up. Move!

914
01:26:49,231 --> 01:26:50,691
- Wait, John.
- Shut up.

915
01:26:50,774 --> 01:26:53,819
- John, it's me. Brandon. You know me.
- Shut up.

916
01:26:53,902 --> 01:26:56,405
- Don't hurt me.
- Take off your shirt.

917
01:26:56,530 --> 01:27:00,575
You know you brought this on yourself,
Teena. Tom, get out the car!

918
01:27:02,035 --> 01:27:05,497
- I'm...
- Take off your shirt. Take off your shirt.

919
01:27:05,580 --> 01:27:09,542
You can make this easy, or you can
get the shit knocked outta you.

920
01:27:09,667 --> 01:27:11,628
All right...

921
01:27:17,466 --> 01:27:22,805
Please, John, wait. Please...
We can work this out. Please.

922
01:27:22,888 --> 01:27:24,890
Get off me. Get off!

923
01:27:26,016 --> 01:27:28,727
Wait, John. Please. Please don't hurt me.

924
01:27:28,727 --> 01:27:31,438
After you had your pants off,

925
01:27:32,689 --> 01:27:35,400
how were you positioned in the back seat?

926
01:27:36,443 --> 01:27:38,028
On my back.

927
01:27:38,111 --> 01:27:40,113
You was on your back?

928
01:27:42,407 --> 01:27:45,618
You say you're 21 and you've
never had sex before. Correct?

929
01:27:45,952 --> 01:27:48,121
That's right.

930
01:27:48,746 --> 01:27:50,957
When they had a spread of ya,

931
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:53,042
when they poked ya,

932
01:27:53,126 --> 01:27:55,836
where'd they try to pop it in first?

933
01:27:56,379 --> 01:27:58,881
I said move your fuckin' hands!

934
01:28:02,092 --> 01:28:04,094
My vagina.

935
01:28:04,178 --> 01:28:06,180
Where?

936
01:28:06,889 --> 01:28:08,891
My vagina.

937
01:28:19,109 --> 01:28:21,069
Go ahead, man. Take it.

938
01:28:32,538 --> 01:28:34,540
Come on. Come on.

939
01:28:34,623 --> 01:28:36,625
Get up there. Get up!

940
01:28:38,294 --> 01:28:40,254
Take this fuckin' thing off.

941
01:28:42,756 --> 01:28:44,758
Take this fuckin' thing off.

942
01:28:54,434 --> 01:28:56,436
No!

943
01:30:13,468 --> 01:30:15,762
Come on, buddy. Let's go.

944
01:30:24,520 --> 01:30:26,605
- You OK?
- Yeah.

945
01:30:35,697 --> 01:30:38,825
Just... just take me home, OK?

946
01:30:41,203 --> 01:30:45,081
If you keep our little secret,
we'll stay friends. Right, little buddy?

947
01:30:45,165 --> 01:30:48,918
Cos if you don't...
we'll have to silence you permanently.

948
01:30:51,629 --> 01:30:56,008
Yeah. Yeah, of course.
I mean, this is all my fault. I know.

949
01:31:09,772 --> 01:31:12,191
You OK in there, little dude?

950
01:31:13,025 --> 01:31:14,484
Yeah!

951
01:31:15,110 --> 01:31:17,070
I'm fine!

952
01:31:29,999 --> 01:31:32,085
I'm gettin' a beer. You want one?

953
01:31:32,210 --> 01:31:33,669
No.

954
01:31:35,338 --> 01:31:38,966
Make sure you get yourself
cleaned up in there.

955
01:31:39,592 --> 01:31:41,886
Will you need any help?

956
01:31:45,556 --> 01:31:47,516
No! I'm good!

957
01:31:57,442 --> 01:32:00,028
You almost ready in there, little dude?

958
01:32:01,404 --> 01:32:03,072
Gimme a break, man!

959
01:32:04,199 --> 01:32:06,200
Gimme two fuckin' seconds!

960
01:32:10,163 --> 01:32:12,123
Tom! Tom!

961
01:32:27,137 --> 01:32:29,222
Oh, my God! Brandon!

962
01:32:31,641 --> 01:32:33,935
What are you doin' here?

963
01:32:34,436 --> 01:32:36,938
Mom, stop it! He's hurt!

964
01:32:40,692 --> 01:32:42,360
Lana...

965
01:32:42,485 --> 01:32:44,862
I don't want it in the house.

966
01:32:45,488 --> 01:32:47,490
Lana...

967
01:32:47,990 --> 01:32:50,409
Mom, stop it. He's hurt!

968
01:32:50,493 --> 01:32:52,495
I'm sorry.

969
01:32:53,954 --> 01:32:56,332
Call an ambulance! Now!

970
01:33:04,464 --> 01:33:06,466
OK, almost.

971
01:33:18,019 --> 01:33:20,313
So they assaulted you?

972
01:33:26,569 --> 01:33:29,196
If you don't mind, it's just necessary...

973
01:33:31,782 --> 01:33:34,827
I need for you to take your pants off, OK?

974
01:33:36,995 --> 01:33:38,997
Please.

975
01:33:39,081 --> 01:33:41,083
I'm not gonna hurt you.

976
01:33:43,877 --> 01:33:46,296
How do you know they raped me?

977
01:34:10,486 --> 01:34:14,531
Why do you run around with guys,
bein' you're a girl yourself?

978
01:34:14,656 --> 01:34:19,536
- Why do you go around kissin' girls?
- I don't know what this has to do with...

979
01:34:19,661 --> 01:34:24,457
I'm tryin' to get some answers,
so I can know exactly what's goin' on.

980
01:34:25,584 --> 01:34:28,712
Are you gonna answer
my question for me or not?

981
01:34:32,590 --> 01:34:35,176
I have a sexual identity crisis.

982
01:34:36,010 --> 01:34:38,012
You what?

983
01:34:40,181 --> 01:34:42,391
A sexual identity crisis.

984
01:35:22,012 --> 01:35:23,973
Brandon...

985
01:35:24,390 --> 01:35:27,309
I just wanted to say I'm really... sorry.

986
01:35:30,229 --> 01:35:32,231
Oh, my God!

987
01:35:32,940 --> 01:35:35,233
What did they do to you?

988
01:35:36,276 --> 01:35:38,987
Oh, my God. Come in here. Come in.

989
01:35:40,655 --> 01:35:42,115
Go inside.

990
01:36:40,212 --> 01:36:44,591
That is a bunch of bull.
If I wanted to rape somebody, I got Mallory.

991
01:36:47,511 --> 01:36:49,471
Listen, John.

992
01:36:49,805 --> 01:36:53,433
I'm just here to tell you
that it's been reported.

993
01:36:53,558 --> 01:36:58,855
Listen to me. So if you did anythin',
or anythin' happened in that room,

994
01:36:59,480 --> 01:37:01,482
you get it cleaned up.

995
01:37:15,746 --> 01:37:20,542
We went out, um... muddin' last night,
and we got stuck in a ditch.

996
01:37:22,961 --> 01:37:26,798
- Seriously.
- Why is she fuckin' makin' lies like that?

997
01:37:32,762 --> 01:37:34,722
Seriously!

998
01:37:36,307 --> 01:37:38,267
You want a beer?

999
01:37:41,187 --> 01:37:43,397
- No, no, no.
- Oh, come on.

1000
01:37:43,481 --> 01:37:45,483
You take care, John.

1001
01:37:46,400 --> 01:37:49,028
I'll come back later. We'll play cards.

1002
01:37:49,111 --> 01:37:52,448
Why don't you just give it
a few days, all right?

1003
01:37:52,573 --> 01:37:54,533
OK.

1004
01:37:59,746 --> 01:38:02,374
God, you're such a stupid fuckin' pussy!

1005
01:38:02,457 --> 01:38:04,459
What, man? You're paranoid.

1006
01:38:04,543 --> 01:38:08,004
She came here to warn us.
She ain't gonna say nothin'.

1007
01:38:08,838 --> 01:38:10,799
Hello?

1008
01:38:11,633 --> 01:38:13,092
Yes, sir.

1009
01:38:13,218 --> 01:38:15,178
No, sir.

1010
01:38:15,386 --> 01:38:18,014
Yes, sir. Tomorrow mornin'.

1011
01:38:18,097 --> 01:38:20,099
Yeah, we'll come by.

1012
01:38:20,183 --> 01:38:23,019
We have to go by the station
tomorrow mornin'.

1013
01:39:00,012 --> 01:39:02,223
Can I come sit by you?

1014
01:39:21,491 --> 01:39:23,493
Do you hate me?

1015
01:39:28,790 --> 01:39:30,792
Do you need anythin'?

1016
01:39:44,638 --> 01:39:46,640
God!

1017
01:39:48,725 --> 01:39:50,686
You're so pretty!

1018
01:39:57,692 --> 01:40:00,403
You're just sayin' that cos you like me.

1019
01:40:00,487 --> 01:40:02,489
No!

1020
01:40:19,380 --> 01:40:21,465
What were you like

1021
01:40:22,299 --> 01:40:24,259
before all this?

1022
01:40:26,553 --> 01:40:28,972
Were you like me? Like a girl girl?

1023
01:40:32,517 --> 01:40:34,477
Yeah.

1024
01:40:35,729 --> 01:40:37,730
Like a long time ago.

1025
01:40:40,233 --> 01:40:43,027
And then I guess I was just like a boy girl.

1026
01:40:44,195 --> 01:40:46,155
And then I was just a jerk.

1027
01:40:51,369 --> 01:40:53,370
It's weird.

1028
01:40:54,705 --> 01:40:57,124
Finally everythin' felt right.

1029
01:41:03,171 --> 01:41:05,465
Boy, that's pretty weird, huh?

1030
01:41:05,966 --> 01:41:07,968
Yep.

1031
01:41:10,136 --> 01:41:13,056
That dream I had? The first night?

1032
01:41:14,933 --> 01:41:16,935
We were on the highway together.

1033
01:41:18,895 --> 01:41:20,897
We can still do it.

1034
01:41:24,025 --> 01:41:25,985
Lana... l, um...

1035
01:41:27,862 --> 01:41:32,783
Look, I never been on the highway
or the Grand Canyon, or any place like that.

1036
01:41:33,492 --> 01:41:36,412
Until I came here,
I never even been outta Lincoln.

1037
01:41:37,162 --> 01:41:39,122
I never even met my dad.

1038
01:41:39,957 --> 01:41:44,544
He died before I was born,
and my sister ain't no model in Hollywood.

1039
01:42:02,478 --> 01:42:05,189
I don't know if I'm gonna know how to do it.

1040
01:42:05,314 --> 01:42:07,691
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

1041
01:42:55,362 --> 01:42:57,656
Um, I was wonderin'

1042
01:42:58,156 --> 01:43:01,493
if you wanna come home
to Lincoln with me.

1043
01:43:03,370 --> 01:43:05,789
My mom, she'll love you.

1044
01:43:06,080 --> 01:43:08,916
And then you gotta meet my cousin Lonny.

1045
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,419
He's a pain, but he's great.

1046
01:43:15,464 --> 01:43:17,466
When are we goin'?

1047
01:43:21,929 --> 01:43:24,348
We have to leave tonight.

1048
01:43:25,265 --> 01:43:27,684
Candace says she'll drive us.

1049
01:43:29,645 --> 01:43:31,313
All right.

1050
01:43:34,149 --> 01:43:36,234
I better get my stuff, then.

1051
01:43:36,318 --> 01:43:37,903
OK.

1052
01:43:54,877 --> 01:43:56,754
I'll be right back.

1053
01:44:11,143 --> 01:44:13,144
Lana...

1054
01:44:14,604 --> 01:44:16,773
Sorry.

1055
01:44:17,399 --> 01:44:20,318
We could leave right now. It's better.

1056
01:44:21,152 --> 01:44:23,154
OK.

1057
01:44:24,072 --> 01:44:26,908
Don't pack too much. We'll send for it later.

1058
01:44:28,451 --> 01:44:30,745
Tomorrow mornin'

1059
01:44:30,870 --> 01:44:34,498
you and I will be eatin' breakfast in Lincoln.

1060
01:44:40,879 --> 01:44:43,257
Did you do somethin' to your hair?

1061
01:44:45,133 --> 01:44:47,135
I don't know.

1062
01:44:48,053 --> 01:44:50,055
You like it?

1063
01:44:50,138 --> 01:44:52,432
I don't know. I guess.

1064
01:44:53,391 --> 01:44:55,685
I'll try and put it back.

1065
01:45:04,110 --> 01:45:06,529
All right... we should go.

1066
01:45:20,167 --> 01:45:22,169
It's OK, Lana.

1067
01:45:22,878 --> 01:45:27,173
You don't have to come
with me now. There'll be time.

1068
01:45:29,968 --> 01:45:32,387
Just make sure you get out.

1069
01:45:32,470 --> 01:45:34,264
OK?

1070
01:45:44,357 --> 01:45:49,153
- John, what are you doin' here?
- Where are they? Are they here?

1071
01:45:49,570 --> 01:45:51,572
Just wait, OK?

1072
01:45:53,032 --> 01:45:54,700
I'll be right back.

1073
01:45:54,992 --> 01:45:57,411
Brandon ain't here.

1074
01:45:59,162 --> 01:46:02,707
- Where is he?
- I don't know, but he ain't here.

1075
01:46:04,793 --> 01:46:06,795
Where's Lana?

1076
01:46:24,603 --> 01:46:25,855
Brandon's at Candace's.

1077
01:46:25,980 --> 01:46:28,148
- What?
- He's at Candace's place.

1078
01:46:41,411 --> 01:46:43,580
- You found him?
- Yeah.

1079
01:46:44,205 --> 01:46:46,624
- What are you guys doin'?
- Oh, shit.

1080
01:46:46,708 --> 01:46:49,127
Listen, you wanna go out for a drink?

1081
01:46:49,210 --> 01:46:51,504
- No.
- Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

1082
01:47:07,561 --> 01:47:10,606
- Where are we goin'?
- Told you not to bring her.

1083
01:47:11,440 --> 01:47:13,400
Stay off the main road.

1084
01:47:16,528 --> 01:47:21,741
Think they'd recognise her
if we chopped off her head and her hands?

1085
01:47:24,160 --> 01:47:26,037
John...

1086
01:47:26,120 --> 01:47:30,291
We're just takin' care of a couple of dykes.
Are you one of 'em?

1087
01:47:31,959 --> 01:47:34,170
Where'd you get that?

1088
01:47:38,549 --> 01:47:41,343
You still plannin' on goin' to Memphis?

1089
01:47:42,177 --> 01:47:43,762
Memphis...

1090
01:48:06,576 --> 01:48:07,827
Why are we here?

1091
01:48:07,952 --> 01:48:10,246
Any others in there, you take care of 'em.

1092
01:48:10,329 --> 01:48:12,540
What are you gonna do to Candace?

1093
01:48:13,582 --> 01:48:15,543
No! John, no!

1094
01:48:15,668 --> 01:48:19,838
Wait! She's got a baby, John!
John, look at me. Look at me. No!

1095
01:48:19,922 --> 01:48:22,007
Get the fuck off of me!

1096
01:48:22,341 --> 01:48:24,218
Candace!

1097
01:48:25,469 --> 01:48:28,889
Get the light, get the light.
Where the fuck is it?!

1098
01:48:31,808 --> 01:48:33,685
Where the fuck is she?

1099
01:48:33,893 --> 01:48:35,145
John...

1100
01:48:35,562 --> 01:48:37,147
John...

1101
01:48:38,064 --> 01:48:39,941
- Don't hurt my baby!
- Stop...

1102
01:48:40,066 --> 01:48:41,317
Shut the fuck up!

1103
01:48:41,401 --> 01:48:43,611
- Don't hurt Candace.
- Don't listen to her!

1104
01:48:43,694 --> 01:48:45,696
She has nothin' to do with this!

1105
01:48:45,780 --> 01:48:49,867
John, you were right about me.
I just keep gettin' back up.

1106
01:48:49,950 --> 01:48:52,453
I said shut up. Shut up!

1107
01:48:52,578 --> 01:48:54,538
Candace!

1108
01:48:55,289 --> 01:48:57,666
- Don't listen to her!
- He said shut up.

1109
01:48:57,791 --> 01:48:59,543
John...

1110
01:49:03,213 --> 01:49:05,382
Teena...

1111
01:49:05,507 --> 01:49:09,261
Please don't hurt my baby, Tom! Please!

1112
01:49:10,178 --> 01:49:11,846
Why didn't you leave?

1113
01:49:13,515 --> 01:49:15,308
We can still do it.

1114
01:49:25,735 --> 01:49:27,069
No!

1115
01:49:27,820 --> 01:49:30,197
No!

1116
01:49:36,453 --> 01:49:41,458
Tom, don't! Please don't hurt my baby,
Tom! Please, God, please!

1117
01:50:03,354 --> 01:50:05,147
No!

1118
01:50:10,027 --> 01:50:11,403
Come on.

1119
01:50:11,487 --> 01:50:13,572
Come on, Lana.

1120
01:50:13,697 --> 01:50:15,657
Come on.

1121
01:52:46,760 --> 01:52:51,431
Dear Lana, by the time you read this,
I'll be back home in Lincoln.

1122
01:52:51,556 --> 01:52:56,352
I'm scared of what's ahead, but when
I think of you... I know I'll be able to go on.

1123
01:52:57,895 --> 01:53:00,815
You were right. Memphis isn't far at all.

1124
01:53:01,649 --> 01:53:04,986
I'll be makin' a trip out on
the highway before too long.

1125
01:53:05,111 --> 01:53:07,071
I'll be waitin' for ya.

1126
01:53:07,196 --> 01:53:10,115
Love always and for ever. Brandon.
