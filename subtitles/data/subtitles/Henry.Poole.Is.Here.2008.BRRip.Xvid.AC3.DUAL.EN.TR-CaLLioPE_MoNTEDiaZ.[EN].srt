1
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:03,350
Oh, my.

2
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,430
Hope you haven't
been waiting long.

3
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:06,990
I'm usually
the first one here.

4
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:10,110
Sorry about that.
All right.

5
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:13,510
I think you're gonna like this three-bedroom
property, Mr. Poole.

6
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:16,910
Right through here, this bathroom
has been completely redone,

7
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:18,710
new tiles, new sink.

8
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:20,750
There are walk-ins
in every room.

9
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,990
And right through here
is the kitchen.

10
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,430
Look at this skylight.
That is nice.

11
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:27,230
And the cabinets, I believe

12
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:29,510
are original, which some
people really enjoy.

13
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,630
And if you follow me
to the backyard.

14
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,910
And, uh...

15
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:37,710
What about the other house?
The one down the street.

16
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:39,350
Oh, right.

17
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:42,710
Well, I made the offer
like you asked,

18
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:44,270
but they didn't
want to sell.

19
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:46,150
Yeah, that house
is not on the market.

20
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:49,390
I mean, did you tell them
that I'd pay whatever they wanted?

21
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:52,870
I did, Mr. Poole.
They live there.

22
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,230
They like it.
That's their home.

23
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:58,190
But anyway,
back to this place...

24
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:01,190
Let me just show you
this backyard.

25
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:04,230
Are you from California,
Mr. Poole?

26
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:07,430
The weather's so nice here. A lot of Cali-
fornians spend time in their backyard.

27
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:09,830
And look at this
there's plenty of room for a pool...

28
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:12,390
- ... or a hot tub.
- How much?

29
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:15,030
Well, they're asking 325.

30
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:18,070
I'm sorry, could you
mind repeating that?

31
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,830
I just have trouble
with this ear.

32
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:23,190
Oh, I'm sorry. I was
saying they're asking 325.

33
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,790
Okay, I'll take it.

34
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,990
Well.

35
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:33,830
Mr. Poole, I'm pretty sure I could
get them to knock off 25 or 30.

36
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:37,350
I mean, look at this place.
It needs to be re-stuccoed and.

37
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:38,670
It's okay.

38
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,590
I'll pay what
they're asking.

39
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,310
But look at the place.

40
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,750
I mean, it needs paint
at the minimum

41
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:48,590
and the landscaping really
leaves a lot to be desired.

42
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:51,670
I'd like to pay
what they want.

43
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,750
No negotiating,
no repairs, just.

44
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:56,230
But Mr. Poole.

45
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,190
Mrs. Wyat,

46
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:01,870
you need to just
let this go. Okay?

47
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:05,110
The higher the price,
the bigger your commission.

48
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:08,550
So...
- Okay, then.

49
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:20,230
<i>Don't got a lot of time</i>

50
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:22,630
<i>Don't give a damn</i>

51
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:25,150
<i>Don't tell me what to do</i>

52
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:27,030
<i>I am the man</i>

53
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:29,950
<i>If there's a God up there</i>

54
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:32,470
<i>Something above</i>

55
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:34,790
<i>God, shine your light down here</i>

56
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,510
<i>Shine on the love</i>

57
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,790
<i>Love of the loveless</i>

58
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,830
<i>Love of the loveless</i>

59
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,150
<i>Don't have too many friends</i>

60
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:51,550
<i>Never felt at home</i>

61
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,750
<i>Always been my own man</i>

62
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:55,790
<i>Pretty much alone</i>

63
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,430
<i>I know how to get through</i>

64
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:01,150
<i>And when push comes to shove</i>

65
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:03,390
<i>I got something that you need</i>

66
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:05,190
<i>I got the love</i>

67
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:07,750
<i>Love of the loveless</i>

68
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,950
<i>Love of the loveless</i>

69
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:16,750
<i>Love of the loveless</i>

70
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:21,750
<i>The love of the loveless</i>

71
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:27,390
<i>All around you,
people walking</i>

72
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:29,910
<i>Empty hearts and
voices talking</i>

73
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:33,110
<i>Looking for and finding</i>

74
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,550
<i>Nothing</i>

75
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:53,910
<i>Don't got a lot of time</i>

76
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:56,230
<i>Don't really care</i>

77
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:58,950
<i>Not selling anything</i>

78
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:01,190
<i>Buyer beware</i>

79
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,670
<i>If there's a God up there</i>

80
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,870
<i>Something above</i>

81
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:08,430
<i>God, shine your light down here</i>

82
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:09,630
<i>Shine on the love</i>

83
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,790
<i>Love of the loveless</i>

84
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,750
<i>Love of the loveless.</i>

85
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,270
Hi.

86
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:42,710
I'm your neighbor
from, from next door,

87
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:43,950
Esperanza Martinez.

88
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:47,110
I just want to come by
and say hello,

89
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:49,550
um, welcome you to
the neighborhood.

90
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:52,750
Hello.
Homemade tamales for you.

91
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,110
Oh.

92
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,630
Thank you.

93
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:57,150
I used to be...

94
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:59,470
good friends with the man
who lived here.

95
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:02,790
I was actually
the one who found him.

96
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:04,590
Found him where?

97
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,790
There in your kitchen.
- Oh.

98
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:09,190
He died of
a heart attack.

99
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:11,630
Fue terrible.

100
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:13,190
It was terrible.

101
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:16,870
He had been laying there
for 10 hours, they think.

102
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:19,350
Here?
- Yes.

103
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:22,190
We were good friends.

104
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:24,590
So where are you from?

105
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:27,310
Not here.

106
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:29,510
Oh.

107
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:32,230
Thank you for
the tamales.

108
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,790
You're welcome.

109
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,590
Looks like
you're burning.

110
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:43,030
I am.
- Are you wearing any sunscreen?

111
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,630
Well, I would have called
before I stopped by,

112
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:48,710
but you still don't
have a phone.

113
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:51,390
- No.
- Yeah, and I rang the.

114
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:54,430
Anyway, I just wanted to make sure
you're doing okay

115
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:57,190
and that the move
went well.

116
00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:00,150
And did you notice that we
re-stuccoed and painted?

117
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:02,710
Yeah, I noticed that.

118
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:05,470
Didn't I ask you
not to do that?

119
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,510
Yeah, well...

120
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:10,110
- I just thought.
- The thing is...

121
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:12,510
I'm not gonna be living here
that long, Mrs. Wyat,

122
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:14,550
so it's really just
a waste of time.

123
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,630
What do you mean, you're not
gonna be living here that long?

124
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,230
And for the record,

125
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:26,470
whoever did it,

126
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,510
they did kind of
a lousy job.

127
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:30,950
It's all discolored
right there.

128
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:35,150
Oh, well...

129
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,990
we can have
that fixed.

130
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:39,150
No, don't bother.

131
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:41,270
It doesn't matter.

132
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,270
Oh.
- Well.

133
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:50,390
Anyhow.

134
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:01,270
<i>Looks like you're burning.</i>

135
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:03,790
I am.
- Are you wearing any sunscreen?

136
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:07,390
Well, I would have called
before I stopped by,

137
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:10,150
but you still don't
have a phone.

138
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:11,870
And I rang the bell.

139
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,830
Well?
And did you notice

140
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,870
that we re-stuccoed
and painted?

141
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:18,350
<i>Yeah, I noticed that.</i>

142
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:20,990
Didn't I ask you
not to do that?

143
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,790
Yeah, well...

144
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,870
- I just thought.
- The thing is,

145
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:27,030
I'm not gonna be living here
that long, Mrs. Wyat.

146
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:30,470
So it's kind of
a waste of time.

147
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:32,190
What do you mean, you're not gonna be
living here that long?

148
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:34,150
And for the record,

149
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:36,590
whoever did it,

150
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:38,710
they did kind of
a lousy job.

151
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:40,390
It's all discolored
right there.

152
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:41,470
Oh, well...

153
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:43,310
we can have
that fixed.

154
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,190
No, don't bother.

155
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:47,470
It doesn't matter.

156
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:48,870
Anyhow.

157
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:04,390
What are you doing?

158
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:36,110
Oh my God.

159
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:27,550
Yes! Really. Really.

160
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:30,510
Yes! Yes!

161
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:37,910
I don't know anything
for sure, but...

162
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,310
It's, it's like...

163
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:45,030
Oh, please please
please please.

164
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:47,470
Okay.
Okay. Okay.

165
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,750
Thank you.
See you soon.

166
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:54,150
Mr. Poole, something very
wonderful has happened.

167
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:55,590
Were you just in
my backyard?

168
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:57,190
Did you not look?

169
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:59,590
Were you looking
in the windows?

170
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:01,070
Ay, no!

171
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:04,110
Of course not.
Did you not see?

172
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:05,990
See what?

173
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:08,030
- Oh. Oh my God.
- I...

174
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:09,510
I, I saw you.

175
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:11,470
You were running around.

176
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:14,230
Oh. Oh.

177
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:15,950
Do you need
to borrow something?

178
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:19,350
Okay, I'll see you later.

179
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:36,550
You don't see it?

180
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,070
See what?

181
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:42,110
All I see is a water stain
from a lousy stucco job.

182
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:44,590
You are not looking.

183
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:52,910
I, I don't see anything.

184
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:56,630
You are not looking.

185
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:59,270
Es el rostro de Dios.

186
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:01,630
The face of God.

187
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:03,790
The face of Christ.

188
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:07,030
It's, it's like a sign
from God.

189
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:09,790
Look, the only sign
I see is that

190
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,750
you seem a little
overexcited.

191
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:13,870
It's probably the heat.

192
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:15,750
I think the heat
has gotten to you.

193
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:17,110
Okay?
- Okay. Okay.

194
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:19,870
I, I, I know it's
hard to believe it.

195
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:22,990
But the proof is right,
right there.

196
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:24,910
All right.

197
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,430
You just going
to ignore it?

198
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:30,030
No. No.

199
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:32,390
I am gonna
ignore you, though.

200
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,790
So who were you
talking to?

201
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,270
To you.

202
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:48,230
No, I mean in your yard.
You were on the phone.

203
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:50,590
Who were you talking to?
- Mmm.

204
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,150
Excuse me?

205
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:57,110
Stay there.

206
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:00,990
Yeah?

207
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:03,030
Hi, I'm looking for
Esperanza Martinez.

208
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:05,310
Said she would be here.
I'm Father Vincent Salizar

209
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:06,910
from St. Ramos
Catholic Church.

210
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:08,470
She called and asked me
to meet her here.

211
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:10,390
Discúlpame.
Qué bueno que llegó.

212
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:12,430
It's in the backyard.
I'll show you.

213
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:14,190
Ven. Come in, come in,
come in.

214
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:16,950
Mire.
Pares aquí.

215
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:19,910
Aquí aquí.
Pares aquí. Aja.

216
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:22,470
Look, I don't know
what you're up to.

217
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:24,350
But I didn't say
you could come back here.

218
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:26,630
And I'd like you
to both leave.

219
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:29,150
You see?

220
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:31,350
Well, I do see something.

221
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:34,390
- Very sorry about the intrusion, Mr.
- Poole.

222
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:35,630
Henry Poole.

223
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:37,470
Mr. Poole, I apologize.

224
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,270
So...

225
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,190
you do see it?

226
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:46,190
Well, I can see how it could
be interpreted as a face.

227
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:48,390
Oh my God.
- That's quite clear.

228
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:52,030
But the face of Christ?

229
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,790
I'm not so sure that

230
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,790
we can make that leap.

231
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:57,510
Thank you.
Thanks.

232
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:59,510
You see?
You understand?

233
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:01,190
And like I was saying,

234
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:03,270
I'd like you to both leave.
I'm kinda busy in there.

235
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:05,870
No no no no no.
Look. Look.

236
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:08,990
You can see
the eyes here

237
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:10,990
and the beard here.

238
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:15,430
And the holy shoulder.

239
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:19,670
Everything. Everything, Padrecito.
Everything.

240
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,110
I can see how
it could be that.

241
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:25,150
These types of things should
not be easily discounted.

242
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:28,630
But we do have to take
these things at face value,

243
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:29,790
no pun intended.

244
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:32,150
Look, the face value
of this

245
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:34,110
is that it's
a water stain.

246
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:35,750
Right?

247
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:38,550
Right?
- You're probably right, Mr. Poole.

248
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:40,510
Yeah. Yeah.

249
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:42,470
And by no means does
the church condone...

250
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:45,350
...any kind of frivolous
claims of this nature, but.

251
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:47,670
But nothing.
Look,

252
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:50,550
the game's over, okay?
That's not the face of Christ

253
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:53,190
and I want to be
left alone!

254
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,510
You're right.

255
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:56,710
You're right, Mr. Poole.

256
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:59,110
We've imposed enough.

257
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,390
Esperanza, let's go.

258
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:03,310
No no, espere un minuto,
¿sí?

259
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:04,710
Mr. Poole,

260
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:07,270
you can't ignore this,
please.

261
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:10,190
- Es que espere, mejor, mejor, sí.
- Esperanza.

262
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:12,750
- vámonos.
- Por favor, espere un minuto.

263
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:14,270
Mr. Poole,

264
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:17,630
don't you believe in God?

265
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:20,230
Please!

266
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:21,550
Please.

267
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,630
Es que, es el rostro
de Dios.

268
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:27,550
Sus ojos.

269
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:14,350
Excuse me.

270
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:16,350
No, wait...

271
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:50,710
These types of things

272
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:52,390
should not be
easily discounted.

273
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:55,110
But we do have to take
these things at face value,

274
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:56,510
no pun intended.

275
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:57,990
<i>Yeah, well, I agree.</i>

276
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:03,710
<i>Please...</i>

277
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:08,830
It's gonna be okay.

278
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:10,830
We're gonna be okay.

279
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:14,430
I'm sorry.

280
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,190
I'm sorry...

281
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:21,830
Hello?

282
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:24,470
Hi. I'm Henry.
I live next door.

283
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:26,110
Oh, yeah.

284
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:28,030
I saw you move in.
I'm Dawn.

285
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:30,310
Hi.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

286
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:32,750
Anyway, your daughter,
I guess,

287
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:35,110
she dropped this
in my backyard.

288
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:37,190
Oh, God, I'm.
I'm so sorry.

289
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:40,350
I keep telling her to stay
out of other people's yards.

290
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:43,590
No, it's not a problem.
She was just walking around back there.

291
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:46,270
Did she tape you?

292
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:49,950
Um...
I don't know.

293
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:51,510
'Cause she does that
sometimes.

294
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:53,790
She tapes people.

295
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:56,030
Why does she do that?

296
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:00,790
Uh...

297
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:02,430
I don't know.

298
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:08,790
Um, well, I've got to go.
But thank you so much

299
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:10,870
for bringing this
back to Millie and...

300
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:13,510
I'll make sure that she
stays out of your yard.

301
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:23,950
You having
another party?

302
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:26,110
Sorry?

303
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:28,990
Well, I've seen you in here a couple
of times buying the same stuff.

304
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:31,110
I thought maybe.
Uh...

305
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:34,190
That'll be $155.82.

306
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:37,870
I thought maybe you might
be throwing some parties.

307
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:40,390
No parties.

308
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:45,030
Well, that doesn't look like
a very healthy diet.

309
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:48,750
Just kind of a phase.

310
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:06,630
Andales. Andales.
Hurry hurry.

311
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:10,310
Go go go with me.

312
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:11,710
Hurry, girl! Hurry.

313
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:12,990
Hurry, Margie.

314
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:20,270
Oh my God, oh my God,
oh my God, oh my God.

315
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:21,870
Hey!
- Oh my God, oh my God.

316
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:23,630
Run run run run!

317
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,750
I see you.

318
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:58,710
Hey! Hey!
Holy shoulder!

319
00:20:58,790 --> 00:20:59,950
Hey.

320
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:02,350
Are these yours?

321
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:07,630
There you go.
You can have those back.

322
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:09,470
Let me ask you
a question.

323
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:12,910
Does that look like a church back there?
'Cause it's not.

324
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:15,150
It's my house.
It's private property.

325
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:17,470
And I don't want you four
wandering around back there

326
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:19,270
when I'm not home
with a bunch of candles

327
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:21,670
doing whatever it is
that those things do. Okay?

328
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,950
And you're gonna put
paint on my wall?

329
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:26,270
All right?
That's vandalism.

330
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:27,990
Got it?
- Please. Please, Mr. Poole.

331
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:31,710
Calm. We didn't paint
anything on your wall.

332
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:32,990
Really?
- Really.

333
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:34,270
No, nothing?
- No no no...

334
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:35,750
Okay, so what's that?

335
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:38,030
Wanna tell me
what that is?

336
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:42,630
Oh my God.

337
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:45,910
That's not paint,
Mr. Poole.

338
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:48,630
And we did not
put it there.

339
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:50,030
So what is it?

340
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:52,670
It's blood.

341
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,590
Oh...
- It's the holy blood.

342
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:56,190
Blood?
- Yes.

343
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:58,030
Okay.

344
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:00,630
Oh my God.
- Let me tell you something.

345
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:03,470
All three of you are
old enough to know better

346
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:05,870
and I'm especially
disappointed in you.

347
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:11,990
Sick of it.

348
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:15,110
Please just leave me alone,
all right?

349
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:17,550
Blood.

350
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:33,470
<i>Whoo hoo</i>

351
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:36,550
<i>Whoo hoo</i>

352
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:39,990
<i>Whoo hoo</i>

353
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,230
<i>Whoo hoo</i>

354
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:46,790
<i>I got my head checked</i>

355
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:50,830
<i>By a jumbo jet</i>

356
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:54,670
<i>It wasn't easy</i>

357
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:58,310
<i>But nothing is</i>

358
00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:59,350
<i>No</i>

359
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:01,150
<i>Whoo hoo</i>

360
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:03,310
<i>When I feel heavy metal</i>

361
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:04,910
<i>Whoo hoo</i>

362
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:06,910
<i>And I'm pins and I'm needles</i>

363
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:08,350
<i>Whoo hoo</i>

364
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:10,510
<i>Well, I lie and I'm easy</i>

365
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:13,390
<i>All of the time but
I'm never sure</i>

366
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:15,950
<i>When I need you</i>

367
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:18,790
<i>Pleased to meet you</i>

368
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:23,310
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

369
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:25,910
Thank you.

370
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:32,190
Ooh! Oops.

371
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:33,750
"Oops?"
- Sorry.

372
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:36,190
Oh, I missed.

373
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:37,590
You, you missed?

374
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:40,030
Eh, let me just
try again.

375
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:41,150
Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

376
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:42,870
Okay.

377
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:48,750
Damn it. Jesus.
Sorry.

378
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:50,310
Oh, damn.
- Eh!

379
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:52,030
You know, seriously,

380
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:53,990
do you want to go
practice and come back?

381
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:57,350
Maybe warm up on, like, an orange?
What's the story?

382
00:23:57,430 --> 00:24:00,030
You know, at this point, I'm just like,
"A razor blade and a coffee cup,

383
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:01,910
I'll do it myself. "
You know what I mean?

384
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:03,310
One more time.

385
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:05,070
It's just
this is the one.

386
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:07,270
Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

387
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:09,830
Okay, just relax.
Okay?

388
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:11,510
I feel it.

389
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:12,950
Okay.

390
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:16,910
Ah, got it.
- Got it?

391
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:18,350
Mm-hmm.
- Good.

392
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:23,070
Ouch! How many times
did she hit you?

393
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:26,270
Uh, three or four.
I actually kinda lost track.

394
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:28,190
Three or four, huh?
She's getting better.

395
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:30,110
She got some practice.

396
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:32,230
Let me just run through
a couple of standard Q and A.

397
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:35,830
You sleeping okay?
- I could always use a little more, yeah.

398
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:37,310
Diet good?

399
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:38,870
I eat, yeah.

400
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:40,790
Exercise?

401
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:42,430
Uh, you know,
here and there.

402
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:43,950
So no?

403
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:45,470
Well...
- Other than that, Mr. Poole,

404
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:46,910
you're doing fine.

405
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:48,670
I'd probably try a little
more exercise.

406
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:51,950
Maybe some yoga?
Or Pilates?

407
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:55,070
I'll call you in a few days when
your blood and urine come back.

408
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:15,430
I can help you
over here.

409
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:32,470
Hope you're not using
that as a mixer.

410
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:35,470
Huh?
- 'Cause you're not getting vodka.

411
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:37,230
Oh, yeah.

412
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:41,030
Did you know that in
1985,

413
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:43,670
Gorbachev, right after he became
the party's general secretary,

414
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,630
tried to eradicate
vodka in Russia?

415
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,430
The people wouldn't
have it, though.

416
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:49,670
Isn't that weird?
I mean...

417
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,910
something like 30,000
Russians die a year

418
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:54,230
from alcohol poisoning,
but the people,

419
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:55,710
they want what
they want.

420
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:57,430
Yeah.

421
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:12,390
What's wrong with you?

422
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:14,750
Hmm?

423
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:16,630
Well, I don't mean
to be rude.

424
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:18,070
It's just that...

425
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:19,750
something is clearly
wrong with you.

426
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:21,750
I don't know if you're sad
or angry or both.

427
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,070
But you're not normal.

428
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:27,670
I thought maybe you might
want to talk about it.

429
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:32,030
You want me to tell you
why I'm sad and angry

430
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:33,990
while you're ringing up
my bottles of bleach?

431
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:36,670
So it is both
sad and angry.

432
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:38,150
I didn't say that.
- Yes, you did.

433
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:39,750
No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

434
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:41,430
I was indulging you.

435
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:43,270
Okay? I was being polite.

436
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:46,870
Okay, indulge me
some more.

437
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:50,150
Tell me what's wrong.
- Why don't you just ring my stuff up,

438
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:52,110
all right?
Jesus.

439
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:53,630
I mean, I appreciate
your concern,

440
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:55,590
but I'd just like to
get out of here.

441
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:57,150
All right?
- Okay.

442
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:01,870
I'm sorry I asked.

443
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:03,270
Don't be.

444
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,990
It's okay to be sad,
you know.

445
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:17,390
I mean, I've been
really sad before.

446
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:19,310
Sometimes...

447
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:22,510
you have to be sad to remind
yourself that you're alive.

448
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:26,270
Better than feeling
nothing, right?

449
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:43,630
It's not coming off, huh?

450
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:44,870
No.

451
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:47,030
No, it isn't.

452
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:50,990
I, uh, think I might have
even made it worse.

453
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:54,510
You, uh, you got
any suggestions?

454
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:57,390
Um, no.

455
00:27:57,470 --> 00:27:59,830
But if it's what
Esperanza says it is,

456
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:03,230
then I guess it's gonna take a little bit
more than a bottle of bleach.

457
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:06,790
Yeah, well,
Esperanza's wrong.

458
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:10,150
So you aren't in
so much doubt.

459
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:14,310
You really think that's
the face of Christ?

460
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:16,230
Actually,

461
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:18,510
from this angle, it looks
a little bit like you.

462
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:22,510
I mean,
an abstract version.

463
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:24,590
I guess.

464
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:26,630
It's just a stain.

465
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:28,630
It's a bad stain.

466
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:30,110
Well, if you can't
get it off,

467
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:31,870
I guess it'll be something
to remember you by.

468
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:33,590
What?

469
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,550
Well, you're not gonna
live here that long, right?

470
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:41,710
Esperanza, she's like the local
newspaper around here.

471
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:44,390
I think she cornered
the real estate agent

472
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:47,590
and so we got
the lowdown on you.

473
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:49,950
Oh. Yeah.

474
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:53,750
So, so what are you doing?
Buying it, selling it and making a profit?

475
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:57,150
Yeah.

476
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:58,910
Yeah, something like that.

477
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:01,990
Well, don't sell it
to any weirdoes, okay?

478
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:04,150
No.

479
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:06,470
I won't.

480
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:09,550
Okay, well,
good luck with the face.

481
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:10,950
Thanks.

482
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:12,510
Or whatever it is.

483
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:58,190
Listen to me.
The man is clearly an atheist.

484
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:00,830
And he's not
very nice.

485
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:03,510
The two
go hand in hand.

486
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:06,270
Well,
those without faith

487
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:08,110
sometimes need
a little help.

488
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:09,270
That's it.

489
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:11,990
Psst, psst.

490
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:17,990
Now what are you doing?

491
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:21,230
Your lawn is so sloopy.
- Sloopy?

492
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:23,550
Yeah.
- Look, this is ridiculous.

493
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:26,710
Okay, people just don't go around
helping one another for no reason.

494
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:29,270
So just tell me
what it is you're doing.

495
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:31,230
What do you want?
- I don't want anything.

496
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:33,030
Just tell him.
Just ask him.

497
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:35,150
Ask me what?

498
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:38,030
She wants to bring
the church in

499
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:39,910
to test the face
in your backyard,

500
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:41,270
to see if it's
a miracle.

501
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:42,670
You've got to
be kidding me.

502
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:44,670
Nope. She's crafty
like that.

503
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:46,510
Aren't you?
- Yeah.

504
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:49,590
I didn't catch your name,
but anyways...

505
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:54,030
Listen to me, okay?

506
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:57,150
You can build me
a goddamn gazebo back there

507
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:59,870
and I still wouldn't let you
and your crazy church friends

508
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:01,990
into my house.
All right?

509
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:05,990
So that face, whatever
you happen to think it is,

510
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:08,110
is a stain.

511
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:09,710
It's not a miracle.

512
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:11,150
Okay?

513
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:13,510
How can you say that?

514
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:16,070
Look, I really don't
want to talk about it,

515
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:17,750
so I just came out here
to give you that.

516
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:20,030
I just found it, so...

517
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:23,550
Oh my God.

518
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:25,710
Why did you have to
go and do that?

519
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:28,910
Um, why are you crying?
I just, I'm sorry.

520
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:30,710
I just found that.

521
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:32,510
That's Leo.

522
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:35,270
He was her boyfriend
before he died.

523
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:37,190
He lived in your house.

524
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,990
He was such a good man.

525
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:42,310
Well, look, there's
a cigar box full of them under the sink,

526
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:44,750
so you can come by and
get 'em when you want 'em.

527
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:55,150
He was so handsome.

528
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:59,790
I, I never thought I'd
find someone like him.

529
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:03,430
I, I was ready to...

530
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:06,270
...to just be old alone.

531
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:09,190
I never married.

532
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:13,030
Never found anyone.

533
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:15,870
Then one day,

534
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:18,630
three years ago or so,

535
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:22,870
Leo came here.

536
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:26,830
And that was it.

537
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:29,790
Years of being alone

538
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:32,030
and one minute...

539
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:37,590
manages to take it
all away.

540
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:42,470
A lifetime of sadness and...

541
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:45,070
suddenly

542
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:48,430
I couldn't even remember

543
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:52,070
what it was like
to be sad.

544
00:32:58,630 --> 00:33:00,270
And then he died.

545
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:06,630
And I remember.

546
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:11,910
And...

547
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:16,110
I pray to God

548
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:18,310
to help me stop

549
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:20,470
feeling that pain

550
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:24,270
and let me know

551
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:26,750
that he was okay.

552
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:32,030
And now...

553
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:36,750
the face appears...

554
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:40,750
...the face of God.

555
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:51,110
Look,

556
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:53,870
Esperanza...

557
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:58,150
I want you to be
very honest with me.

558
00:33:58,230 --> 00:33:59,670
Okay?

559
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:05,350
You really think that
that stain out there

560
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:07,870
is the answer to
all your prayers?

561
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:09,990
Do you?

562
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:18,870
So what exactly is it that
you want the church to do?

563
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:23,470
Just come and test
the wall.

564
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:25,750
Test the blood.

565
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:28,550
And to see what it is.

566
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:31,830
And if it's nothing,
then it's nothing.

567
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:35,190
And I won't
bother you again.

568
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:37,350
I promise, really.

569
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:40,990
Um...

570
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:45,910
All right.

571
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:48,790
Just one day.
That's it.

572
00:34:48,910 --> 00:34:51,270
I mean it.
One day.

573
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:53,830
Thank you, Mr. Poole.

574
00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:55,390
Thank you.

575
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:56,870
You're welcome.

576
00:34:56,950 --> 00:34:58,070
Thank you.

577
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:59,950
You'll see.
You'll see.

578
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:04,950
Everything happens
for a reason.

579
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:17,590
Esperanza,
llevélo al dentro.

580
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:20,310
Gracias.
- Who's that guy?

581
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:23,590
He has to open up the wall and look
at what's behind the stain

582
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:25,710
to be sure it's not
man-made.

583
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,070
We'll repair it.
It'll look as good as new. Don't worry.

584
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:30,430
No, don't repair it.
It's okay.

585
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:33,430
Don't be silly, Mr. Poole. We're not
gonna leave a hole in the wall.

586
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:35,510
Doesn't matter.

587
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,710
I'm not gonna be here
that long.

588
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:51,710
You know, Father Salizar,
the house was re-stuccoed

589
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:54,190
before I moved in,
so that's it.

590
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:56,590
There's really not
a lot to talk about.

591
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:01,030
Maybe not about the house.

592
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:04,550
Why did you say you were
not gonna be here that long?

593
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:08,630
I don't really want
to talk about it.

594
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:09,790
Oh, yeah, you do.

595
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:11,990
Oh, I do?

596
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:13,790
Otherwise you wouldn't
have mentioned it.

597
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:16,790
Let me ask you
a question.

598
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:23,150
What makes you think
you know me that well?

599
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:25,030
I don't think that.

600
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:28,230
I just think anybody with two eyes
could see that something is wrong.

601
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:31,510
- Like you're.
- Sad and angry?

602
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:33,630
Yeah.

603
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:35,270
Something like that.

604
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:36,710
Yeah.

605
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:39,710
I'm a good listener.

606
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:42,590
Yeah? Me too.

607
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:09,910
I just think anybody with two eyes

608
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:11,510
could see that something
is wrong.

609
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:15,190
- Like you're.
- Sad and angry?

610
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:19,070
Yeah.

611
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:20,350
Something
like that.

612
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:27,950
I just think anybody
with two eyes

613
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:29,430
could see that something
is wrong.

614
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:33,390
- Like you're.
- Sad and angry?

615
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:36,430
Yeah.

616
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:38,270
Something
like that.

617
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:56,950
What are you doing
in there?

618
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:28,070
Wow.

619
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:31,670
You really like
this place.

620
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:48,910
You don't talk,
do you, Millie?

621
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:53,230
It's okay.

622
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:57,670
Sometimes I don't like
to talk either.

623
00:38:57,790 --> 00:38:59,510
You know?

624
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:07,790
I ought to go.

625
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:11,190
Okay?

626
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:14,470
I'd love to sit here and visit
with you, but I just can't.

627
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:20,710
I got a pretty long journey
ahead of me.

628
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:24,190
I wish I could stay
and talk with you.

629
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:26,550
I just don't have
the time.

630
00:39:57,790 --> 00:39:59,510
Mr. Poole? Uh...

631
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:02,270
I, I'm sorry.
I rang the bell, but.

632
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:06,590
Well, I have something
for you.

633
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:17,950
How'd you know
this was the one?

634
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:20,590
I know everything
about this neighborhood.

635
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:23,110
You should know that
by now.

636
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:40,950
This used to be my room.

637
00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:43,790
Mr. Poole,
are you okay?

638
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:46,470
This used to be my room.

639
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:51,670
This is the last place
I remember being happy.

640
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:56,630
Even then
I can barely remember.

641
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:16,910
This is the room where they
used to scream at each other.

642
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:18,470
Mmm.

643
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:33,750
It's a strange thing
about standing here again.

644
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:38,390
It's doing absolutely nothing
for me, you know?

645
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:43,190
Mr. Poole,

646
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:46,470
I'm sorry it wasn't
what you hoped.

647
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:47,950
Don't be.

648
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:49,710
It never is.

649
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:51,550
But thank you.

650
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:53,550
This was very generous.

651
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:55,110
Mmm.
- Thanks.

652
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:58,390
What did you expect?

653
00:41:58,470 --> 00:42:00,830
You can't go to the past
to fix the present.

654
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:05,430
You sound like
a fortune cookie.

655
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:09,390
Cookies don't talk.

656
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:11,630
Now.

657
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:14,070
at least
now you know.

658
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:16,750
Know what?

659
00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:20,950
To come back to
the place you grew up.

660
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:23,070
Yeah.

661
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:24,750
Now I know.

662
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:28,910
It's like nothing.

663
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:31,270
You find out
there's nowhere to hide.

664
00:42:33,310 --> 00:42:36,910
<i>Shadows are falling</i>

665
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:39,950
<i>And I been here all day</i>

666
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:46,110
<i>It's too hot to sleep</i>

667
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:49,030
<i>And time is running away</i>

668
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:54,470
<i>I feel like my soul has</i>

669
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:57,670
<i>Turned into steel</i>

670
00:43:00,790 --> 00:43:02,870
<i>I've still got the scars</i>

671
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:06,750
<i>That the sun didn't heal</i>

672
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:13,550
<i>There's not even room enough</i>

673
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:16,390
<i>To be anywhere</i>

674
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:22,550
<i>It's not dark yet</i>

675
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:25,030
<i>But it's gettin' there.</i>

676
00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:50,430
Millie?

677
00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:55,270
Hey.

678
00:43:57,190 --> 00:43:59,790
Come out, honey.
It's too late to be playing games.

679
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:08,590
Where are you?
Millie!

680
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:11,990
Where are you?
Millie!

681
00:44:16,830 --> 00:44:18,310
Millie?

682
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:30,230
Millie?

683
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:53,830
Millie?

684
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:55,830
What are you doing?

685
00:45:00,590 --> 00:45:02,230
Honey?

686
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:09,590
Hey, Millie.

687
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:19,070
Millie.

688
00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:22,070
Hey.

689
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:25,870
What is it?

690
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:31,350
Hey, what did you say?

691
00:45:32,310 --> 00:45:34,430
What?

692
00:45:34,510 --> 00:45:36,110
Hey.

693
00:45:40,350 --> 00:45:41,950
What did you say?

694
00:45:45,430 --> 00:45:46,950
Mama.

695
00:45:48,470 --> 00:45:51,710
Mommy?
Can you hear me?

696
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:53,670
We're okay.

697
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:56,630
I love you so so much.

698
00:45:58,830 --> 00:46:01,070
I'm sorry.

699
00:46:02,790 --> 00:46:04,870
I'm so sorry, baby.

700
00:46:04,950 --> 00:46:07,190
I'm sorry.

701
00:46:07,270 --> 00:46:08,870
Mommy's here.

702
00:46:08,950 --> 00:46:11,350
Mommy's right here.

703
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:15,350
Come on.
Let's go.

704
00:46:15,430 --> 00:46:18,190
Hey, let's go home.

705
00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:46,510
Thanks.

706
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:53,350
What happened out there?

707
00:46:56,670 --> 00:46:58,590
You tell me.

708
00:46:59,870 --> 00:47:03,030
She hasn't said a word
in over a year,

709
00:47:03,110 --> 00:47:04,950
ever since
her father left.

710
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:07,870
I mean, she loved him
so much.

711
00:47:09,230 --> 00:47:11,310
And it's just been...

712
00:47:11,390 --> 00:47:13,230
so unfair for her.

713
00:47:13,310 --> 00:47:16,710
I mean, I, I couldn't
even get her out of bed

714
00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:18,910
when this
whole thing started.

715
00:47:18,990 --> 00:47:22,750
She just kind of
turned inside herself

716
00:47:22,830 --> 00:47:26,310
and couldn't find
her way out.

717
00:47:26,390 --> 00:47:29,270
and I took to every kind
of doctor, therapists,

718
00:47:29,350 --> 00:47:31,110
psychologists,

719
00:47:31,190 --> 00:47:35,350
psychiatrists, and pretty much
everyone nothing.

720
00:47:35,430 --> 00:47:39,190
They'd just run down the list
depression, post-traumatic...

721
00:47:39,270 --> 00:47:41,510
...whatever...

722
00:47:41,590 --> 00:47:43,870
...abandonment.

723
00:47:43,950 --> 00:47:47,110
And after a while,
she got a little better,

724
00:47:47,190 --> 00:47:50,150
but she just
wouldn't talk.

725
00:47:50,230 --> 00:47:52,870
Maybe she just didn't
have anything to say.

726
00:47:52,950 --> 00:47:54,910
Maybe she wasn't ready
until now?

727
00:47:54,990 --> 00:47:58,870
Maybe. But she touched
that wall and she.

728
00:47:58,950 --> 00:48:01,350
You think she spoke because
she touched the wall?

729
00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:03,390
No, I'm not saying that,
but that's what happened.

730
00:48:03,470 --> 00:48:07,430
I mean, she touched it
and she talked.

731
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:10,030
And I'm just praying
that it stays that way.

732
00:48:10,110 --> 00:48:13,350
Dawn, I think it's great
that Millie spoke.

733
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:17,230
But I think you
should realize

734
00:48:17,310 --> 00:48:19,430
it was a completely
random event.

735
00:48:19,510 --> 00:48:22,510
Things just, they don't
happen like that in real life.

736
00:48:22,590 --> 00:48:25,950
I mean, if they did,
then I wouldn't.

737
00:48:26,030 --> 00:48:27,830
You wouldn't what?

738
00:48:31,070 --> 00:48:34,590
Ever feel like things
just happen for no reason?

739
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:39,710
That you're just kind of
going along for the ride

740
00:48:39,790 --> 00:48:43,150
and there's just
nothing you can do?

741
00:48:49,430 --> 00:48:51,830
I need to
tell you something.

742
00:48:51,910 --> 00:48:54,070
What?

743
00:48:54,150 --> 00:48:58,230
I want to tell you so that I'm
not the only one that knows.

744
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:00,670
Henry, this is so unheard of
here in the States.

745
00:49:00,750 --> 00:49:03,430
I mean, it happens.

746
00:49:03,510 --> 00:49:07,230
- But this disease.
- Disease?

747
00:49:10,950 --> 00:49:13,710
It steamrolls
through the system.

748
00:49:16,070 --> 00:49:18,510
Stopping it
at this point.

749
00:49:22,390 --> 00:49:24,150
You're saying
I'm gonna die.

750
00:49:26,190 --> 00:49:27,590
Yes.

751
00:50:47,030 --> 00:50:48,950
Mr. Poole.
Mr. Poole,

752
00:50:49,030 --> 00:50:51,350
are you okay?
Mr. Poole?

753
00:50:51,430 --> 00:50:54,990
Sorry.
The door was open.

754
00:50:55,070 --> 00:50:58,190
That doesn't mean you can
just walk through it.

755
00:50:58,270 --> 00:50:59,870
I need to talk to you.

756
00:50:59,950 --> 00:51:02,310
No. No, you don't,
actually,

757
00:51:02,390 --> 00:51:05,430
'cause I know exactly
what you're gonna say.

758
00:51:05,510 --> 00:51:08,870
No, you don't exactly.

759
00:51:08,950 --> 00:51:12,790
So I guess you heard
what happened last night.

760
00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:15,830
Now you think
that little girl spoke

761
00:51:15,910 --> 00:51:18,150
because she touched
the wall?

762
00:51:18,230 --> 00:51:21,390
And now we're all supposed to believe
that the Second Coming's happening

763
00:51:21,470 --> 00:51:23,510
in my backyard.

764
00:51:23,590 --> 00:51:26,190
And the next thing you know,
this whole goddamn street...

765
00:51:26,270 --> 00:51:30,030
...sorry, turns into a carnival
with every holy-roller freak...

766
00:51:30,110 --> 00:51:32,470
...within a 100-mile radius
lined up around the block...

767
00:51:32,550 --> 00:51:35,830
...to touch or catch a glimpse
of my stucco job.

768
00:51:35,910 --> 00:51:39,310
Well, it's not gonna happen.

769
00:51:39,390 --> 00:51:41,590
And in no way did Millie
finally speaking

770
00:51:41,670 --> 00:51:43,750
have anything to do
with her touching the wall,

771
00:51:43,830 --> 00:51:45,750
and you know that.

772
00:51:45,830 --> 00:51:49,750
And God only knows and I use
the phrase very loosely, believe me...

773
00:51:49,830 --> 00:51:52,870
Who knows what it was that caused her
to get up at 3:00 in the morning

774
00:51:52,950 --> 00:51:55,310
and wander over here and
start palming the wall

775
00:51:55,390 --> 00:51:57,070
like her life
depended on it.

776
00:51:57,150 --> 00:51:59,070
It was me.
- What was you?

777
00:51:59,150 --> 00:52:02,110
I told her the wall would
take away her suffering

778
00:52:02,190 --> 00:52:04,430
if, if she just
had faith.

779
00:52:04,510 --> 00:52:05,870
Why would you do that?

780
00:52:05,950 --> 00:52:07,630
It worked, no?
- No.

781
00:52:07,710 --> 00:52:10,350
She worked. Maybe your
insane pep talk got to her,

782
00:52:10,430 --> 00:52:12,070
but she got here
on her own.

783
00:52:12,150 --> 00:52:15,110
Why it's so hard
for you to believe

784
00:52:15,190 --> 00:52:17,270
that something like this
could happen?

785
00:52:17,350 --> 00:52:19,270
Why is it so important
to you that I believe

786
00:52:19,350 --> 00:52:20,910
that something like that
could happen?

787
00:52:20,990 --> 00:52:22,790
- Because it.
- Because I'll tell you.

788
00:52:22,870 --> 00:52:26,070
Because if you can convince me,
then suddenly your beliefs

789
00:52:26,150 --> 00:52:28,310
become more real.
Right?

790
00:52:28,390 --> 00:52:31,710
The more people you can get to
jump on your God's-on-the-wall train,

791
00:52:31,790 --> 00:52:33,790
the more your mission's made.
So until you get me

792
00:52:33,870 --> 00:52:36,310
to swallow your world
and believe what you believe,

793
00:52:36,390 --> 00:52:38,910
you'll never have the kind
of faith you want to have.

794
00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:41,270
You'll always have
a little bit of doubt.

795
00:52:41,350 --> 00:52:43,950
You'll, you'll never
know if you're quite right.

796
00:52:44,030 --> 00:52:45,950
You'll always kind of
be wondering if it's real.

797
00:52:46,030 --> 00:52:48,830
You'll always be sitting over
there waiting for that man

798
00:52:48,910 --> 00:52:51,030
to come waltzing back
in from the dead.

799
00:52:52,990 --> 00:52:55,590
And that's sad.

800
00:52:55,670 --> 00:52:57,830
That's really sad.

801
00:52:57,910 --> 00:53:02,070
I'm just trying
to help.

802
00:53:02,150 --> 00:53:03,630
Just like that.

803
00:53:03,710 --> 00:53:05,030
Yeah?

804
00:53:12,670 --> 00:53:13,910
Esp.

805
00:53:14,910 --> 00:53:16,550
Esperanza?

806
00:53:49,870 --> 00:53:51,630
Hey.
- Hey.

807
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:54,550
How you doin'?

808
00:53:55,830 --> 00:53:57,230
I'm good.

809
00:53:57,310 --> 00:53:58,870
Just getting some air.

810
00:53:58,950 --> 00:54:00,750
I just wanted
to thank you

811
00:54:00,830 --> 00:54:03,670
for helping me with
Millie last night.

812
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:05,550
So...

813
00:54:05,630 --> 00:54:07,150
I made you some cookies.

814
00:54:07,230 --> 00:54:09,550
Thank you.

815
00:54:09,630 --> 00:54:12,150
It was Millie's idea.

816
00:54:14,270 --> 00:54:16,910
How is she doing?
- She's really good.

817
00:54:16,990 --> 00:54:20,390
I'm just praying
that it stays that way.

818
00:54:23,990 --> 00:54:25,830
You wanna go
for a walk?

819
00:54:25,910 --> 00:54:28,190
Yeah.

820
00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:36,390
Mmm, just came out of the oven,
like, 10 minutes ago.

821
00:54:36,470 --> 00:54:40,870
<i>Her fingers touch upon my lips</i>

822
00:54:40,950 --> 00:54:44,710
<i>It's a morning yearning</i>

823
00:54:44,790 --> 00:54:48,430
<i>It's a morning yearning...</i>

824
00:54:48,510 --> 00:54:50,710
<i>Pull the curtains shut</i>

825
00:54:50,790 --> 00:54:53,430
<i>And try to keep it dark</i>

826
00:54:53,510 --> 00:54:57,230
<i>But the sun is burning</i>

827
00:54:57,310 --> 00:55:01,630
<i>The sun is burning</i>

828
00:55:13,390 --> 00:55:17,630
<i>Baby crying kept us up all night</i>

829
00:55:17,710 --> 00:55:21,590
<i>With her morning yearning</i>

830
00:55:21,670 --> 00:55:26,310
<i>With her morning yearning...</i>

831
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:33,750
<i>Morning yearning...</i>

832
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:36,950
I just wish I could tell you that
everything was gonna be all right.

833
00:55:37,030 --> 00:55:38,750
That's okay.

834
00:55:51,790 --> 00:55:53,950
Now what?

835
00:55:58,390 --> 00:56:00,150
Now I go home.

836
00:56:00,230 --> 00:56:02,310
And then...

837
00:56:02,390 --> 00:56:04,470
I wish I didn't.

838
00:56:13,990 --> 00:56:16,510
<i>Like a summer rose</i>

839
00:56:16,590 --> 00:56:19,310
<i>I'm a victim of the fall</i>

840
00:56:19,390 --> 00:56:23,830
<i>But am soon returning</i>

841
00:56:23,910 --> 00:56:26,910
<i>Soon returning</i>

842
00:56:26,990 --> 00:56:31,550
<i>Your love's the warmest
place the sun ever shines</i>

843
00:56:31,630 --> 00:56:35,510
<i>My morning yearning</i>

844
00:56:35,590 --> 00:56:40,030
<i>My morning yearning.</i>

845
00:56:53,070 --> 00:56:55,310
My God.

846
00:56:55,390 --> 00:56:57,630
Dear God.

847
00:57:15,670 --> 00:57:17,310
Oh my God.

848
00:57:21,190 --> 00:57:22,750
Patience.

849
00:57:24,630 --> 00:57:27,830
What are you doing?
What's going on?

850
00:57:29,950 --> 00:57:31,710
Are you, are you okay?

851
00:57:31,790 --> 00:57:33,110
Yeah.

852
00:57:33,190 --> 00:57:36,710
What's wrong?
- Nothing is wrong.

853
00:57:36,790 --> 00:57:38,550
Everything is right.

854
00:57:38,630 --> 00:57:40,310
What are you talking about?

855
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:42,150
I touched the face.

856
00:57:42,230 --> 00:57:46,470
I just put
my hand on it.

857
00:57:48,350 --> 00:57:51,670
And my whole body
got all warm.

858
00:57:51,750 --> 00:57:54,310
And then I closed
my eyes.

859
00:57:54,390 --> 00:57:56,550
I saw light everywhere.

860
00:57:58,390 --> 00:58:00,590
I opened them...

861
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:08,750
and I could see.

862
00:58:20,470 --> 00:58:22,230
I can see.

863
00:58:28,110 --> 00:58:29,750
Look at that.

864
00:58:29,830 --> 00:58:32,350
I can see perfectly.

865
00:58:34,670 --> 00:58:37,950
The house numbers,
the license plate.

866
00:58:45,150 --> 00:58:48,190
You know,
this is amazing.

867
00:58:48,270 --> 00:58:50,750
- This is a miracle.
- Don't say that.

868
00:58:50,830 --> 00:58:53,630
What? Miracle?

869
00:58:53,710 --> 00:58:56,710
Yeah.
- Come on, Mr. Poole,

870
00:58:56,790 --> 00:58:58,830
what else could this be?

871
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:00,990
What?
A coincidence?

872
00:59:01,070 --> 00:59:03,230
I mean, there are
no miracles, Patience.

873
00:59:03,310 --> 00:59:05,230
I don't believe in them.

874
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:08,830
Imagine that there was
something wrong with you,

875
00:59:08,910 --> 00:59:10,430
Mr. Poole.

876
00:59:10,510 --> 00:59:13,830
And you did this seemingly
meaningless thing,

877
00:59:13,910 --> 00:59:17,230
put your hand
on a wall,

878
00:59:17,310 --> 00:59:19,590
and you were healed.

879
00:59:25,950 --> 00:59:29,070
It's okay, Mr. Poole.
You don't have to say anything.

880
00:59:29,150 --> 00:59:30,910
I gotta go.

881
00:59:30,990 --> 00:59:32,830
I gotta go
tell my mom.

882
00:59:34,910 --> 00:59:37,310
This is incredible!

883
00:59:38,470 --> 00:59:39,830
Wow!

884
00:59:42,230 --> 00:59:43,630
Hi.

885
00:59:43,710 --> 00:59:44,950
Hey.

886
00:59:49,750 --> 00:59:52,150
It's getting harder,
isn't it?

887
00:59:52,230 --> 00:59:53,630
What's that?

888
00:59:53,710 --> 00:59:56,390
To pretend this
isn't happening.

889
01:00:27,070 --> 01:00:28,790
Hey!

890
01:00:28,870 --> 01:00:30,070
Hi.
- You're home.

891
01:00:30,150 --> 01:00:31,630
Yeah.
- Um...

892
01:00:31,710 --> 01:00:34,150
Millie wants to know if you
want to come over and play.

893
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:36,070
Really?

894
01:00:36,150 --> 01:00:39,510
Um, I just don't think
I'm up to it.

895
01:00:39,590 --> 01:00:41,230
Henry...
- I think I'll just stay here.

896
01:00:41,310 --> 01:00:44,590
are you actually considering
saying no to a six-year-old girl

897
01:00:44,670 --> 01:00:47,670
with actual words coming
out of her little mouth?

898
01:00:49,910 --> 01:00:52,110
Give me a minute.

899
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:54,030
We'll be in the yard.

900
01:01:02,750 --> 01:01:04,350
Millie?

901
01:01:06,550 --> 01:01:07,910
Dawn?

902
01:01:12,270 --> 01:01:13,550
I got you, Mr. Poole.

903
01:01:13,630 --> 01:01:15,150
Let's get him!

904
01:01:16,790 --> 01:01:18,910
Get him, Mommy, get him!
- I got him!

905
01:01:18,990 --> 01:01:20,470
Ahhh!

906
01:01:44,390 --> 01:01:45,790
Oh, gosh.

907
01:01:45,870 --> 01:01:48,030
I surrender.
You win.

908
01:01:48,110 --> 01:01:50,030
I surrender.

909
01:01:53,550 --> 01:01:55,990
<i>A million tears</i>

910
01:01:56,070 --> 01:01:58,550
<i>A million codes</i>

911
01:01:58,630 --> 01:02:01,110
<i>1:15</i>

912
01:02:01,190 --> 01:02:03,150
<i>No way to go</i>

913
01:02:03,230 --> 01:02:05,790
<i>You point your finger</i>

914
01:02:05,870 --> 01:02:08,150
<i>To the moon</i>

915
01:02:08,230 --> 01:02:10,710
<i>It looks like rain</i>

916
01:02:10,790 --> 01:02:12,790
<i>Coming soon</i>

917
01:02:12,870 --> 01:02:15,270
<i>I figured all</i>

918
01:02:15,350 --> 01:02:17,910
<i>My worst fears</i>

919
01:02:17,990 --> 01:02:22,550
<i>Believe in childlike heroes</i>

920
01:02:22,630 --> 01:02:24,990
<i>But I don't want to go</i>

921
01:02:25,070 --> 01:02:27,070
<i>That way</i>

922
01:02:27,150 --> 01:02:30,190
<i>Surrender hope</i>

923
01:02:30,270 --> 01:02:32,710
<i>Again</i>

924
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:36,990
<i>I don't want to go that way</i>

925
01:02:37,070 --> 01:02:40,070
<i>Surrender hope</i>

926
01:02:40,150 --> 01:02:42,910
<i>And faith</i>

927
01:02:42,990 --> 01:02:44,910
<i>Again</i>

928
01:02:52,390 --> 01:02:54,990
<i>Your blood, your fire</i>

929
01:02:55,070 --> 01:02:57,510
<i>Your kiss good night</i>

930
01:02:57,590 --> 01:02:59,870
<i>Your words, sometime</i>

931
01:02:59,950 --> 01:03:02,630
<i>They might be mine</i>

932
01:03:02,710 --> 01:03:07,150
<i>I feel this love
could cross the sand</i>

933
01:03:07,230 --> 01:03:11,830
<i>I want to feel that way</i>

934
01:03:17,310 --> 01:03:21,670
<i>The fire might linger
and fade away</i>

935
01:03:21,750 --> 01:03:26,030
<i>The shadows run
from yesterday</i>

936
01:03:26,110 --> 01:03:28,790
<i>Like everyone</i>

937
01:03:28,870 --> 01:03:33,430
<i>And everything were memories</i>

938
01:03:33,510 --> 01:03:35,910
<i>And then appears</i>

939
01:03:35,990 --> 01:03:38,630
<i>Your blood, your fire</i>

940
01:03:38,710 --> 01:03:40,950
<i>Your kiss good night</i>

941
01:03:41,030 --> 01:03:43,350
<i>Your words, sometimes</i>

942
01:03:43,430 --> 01:03:45,950
<i>They might be mine</i>

943
01:03:46,030 --> 01:03:50,590
<i>I feel this love
could cross the sand</i>

944
01:03:50,670 --> 01:03:54,670
<i>I want to feel that way</i>

945
01:03:54,750 --> 01:03:59,550
<i>Oh, don't make
me feel that way</i>

946
01:03:59,630 --> 01:04:01,830
<i>Oh, I want to feel</i>

947
01:04:01,910 --> 01:04:05,790
<i>That way</i>

948
01:04:05,870 --> 01:04:08,950
<i>Oh, I'm breaking through</i>

949
01:04:09,030 --> 01:04:11,630
<i>These walls of steel</i>

950
01:04:11,710 --> 01:04:16,270
<i>Pushing that wall
for something real</i>

951
01:04:16,350 --> 01:04:20,590
<i>I'm falling far and faster still</i>

952
01:04:20,670 --> 01:04:23,070
<i>Wake up, wake up</i>

953
01:04:23,150 --> 01:04:27,190
<i>Wake up, wake up..</i>

954
01:04:28,390 --> 01:04:30,710
<i>Wake up, wake up</i>

955
01:04:30,790 --> 01:04:34,590
<i>Everyone and everything</i>

956
01:04:34,670 --> 01:04:39,110
<i>Everyone and everything.</i>

957
01:04:52,550 --> 01:04:54,110
- All right?
- Yeah.

958
01:04:54,190 --> 01:04:55,790
You ready?

959
01:04:55,870 --> 01:04:57,550
- Okay, good.
- Hey!

960
01:04:58,510 --> 01:04:59,750
Hey.

961
01:04:59,830 --> 01:05:01,110
Hi, Mr. Poole.

962
01:05:01,190 --> 01:05:03,150
Hey, there, Millie.

963
01:05:03,230 --> 01:05:05,070
That's a really nice dress.

964
01:05:05,150 --> 01:05:07,510
You look really pretty.

965
01:05:07,590 --> 01:05:09,910
You look nervous,
Mr. Poole.

966
01:05:09,990 --> 01:05:12,710
Oh, no, I'm, I'm fine.

967
01:05:12,790 --> 01:05:14,790
I, uh, no.

968
01:05:14,870 --> 01:05:16,830
I'm just a little tired,
that's all.

969
01:05:16,910 --> 01:05:19,350
You kind of wore me
out yesterday.

970
01:05:19,430 --> 01:05:21,190
Um, honey,

971
01:05:21,270 --> 01:05:23,590
do you want to
get in the car?

972
01:05:25,990 --> 01:05:28,710
I wanted to, uh,
return your dish to you.

973
01:05:28,790 --> 01:05:30,110
Oh, thanks.

974
01:05:30,190 --> 01:05:31,830
They were really good.
Thanks a lot.

975
01:05:31,910 --> 01:05:33,430
Glad you liked them.

976
01:05:33,510 --> 01:05:35,750
Really shouldn't eat
so many at once, though.

977
01:05:35,830 --> 01:05:37,830
Not good for you.
- No, it doesn't matter.

978
01:05:37,910 --> 01:05:40,350
I mean, I'm.
Uh, no, you're right.

979
01:05:40,430 --> 01:05:42,590
I shouldn't.

980
01:05:42,670 --> 01:05:44,990
Well, listen, I...

981
01:05:45,070 --> 01:05:46,750
I was wondering and,
I don't know,

982
01:05:46,830 --> 01:05:48,310
it might seem
a little unfair

983
01:05:48,390 --> 01:05:50,110
seeing as how you know
my situation,

984
01:05:50,190 --> 01:05:52,550
but I thought that maybe,

985
01:05:52,630 --> 01:05:54,510
if you were able to get
a sitter and you had the time.

986
01:05:54,590 --> 01:05:55,910
Yes.
- Really?

987
01:05:55,990 --> 01:05:57,550
Oh. Oh, wait.

988
01:05:57,630 --> 01:05:59,510
What?
- Can I ask you?

989
01:05:59,590 --> 01:06:02,150
Well, you did just
ask me, didn't you?

990
01:06:02,230 --> 01:06:04,590
No, I mean,
really ask you...

991
01:06:04,670 --> 01:06:06,910
...to finish asking you.

992
01:06:06,990 --> 01:06:08,110
Okay.

993
01:06:08,190 --> 01:06:09,830
Would you like to
get dinner with me?

994
01:06:09,910 --> 01:06:11,550
I can't.
I'm busy.

995
01:06:11,630 --> 01:06:13,350
- I didn't really want to any.
- No!

996
01:06:13,430 --> 01:06:14,910
Henry, I'm kidding.

997
01:06:14,990 --> 01:06:16,470
I would love to.

998
01:06:16,550 --> 01:06:18,510
Great.
- What about tomorrow?

999
01:06:18,590 --> 01:06:20,630
It's perfect.

1000
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:23,630
And it's not unfair
for you to ask.

1001
01:06:23,710 --> 01:06:25,910
Would it be worse
if you didn't?

1002
01:06:25,990 --> 01:06:27,830
Thank you.

1003
01:06:28,790 --> 01:06:30,350
Okay, so...

1004
01:06:30,430 --> 01:06:32,310
Tomorrow.
- Yeah.

1005
01:06:34,030 --> 01:06:35,590
Have fun.

1006
01:06:59,110 --> 01:07:01,830
Just this once,
okay?

1007
01:07:02,790 --> 01:07:04,070
Okay, I promise.

1008
01:07:04,150 --> 01:07:05,630
Whatever you say,
Mr. Poole.

1009
01:07:05,710 --> 01:07:07,550
Thank you.

1010
01:07:09,030 --> 01:07:10,510
What's wrong with her?

1011
01:07:10,590 --> 01:07:12,430
Bursitis.

1012
01:07:12,510 --> 01:07:14,310
And what about
the one next to her?

1013
01:07:14,390 --> 01:07:15,950
There's nothing
wrong with her.

1014
01:07:16,030 --> 01:07:18,270
So, preventative?

1015
01:07:18,350 --> 01:07:20,870
Just in case.

1016
01:07:20,950 --> 01:07:23,270
No, is it true that
the man in the red shirt

1017
01:07:23,350 --> 01:07:25,230
just wants to be
a better dancer?

1018
01:07:27,070 --> 01:07:29,070
Ay, Mr. Poole...

1019
01:07:33,390 --> 01:07:36,270
Um, what about you,
Mr. Poole?

1020
01:07:36,350 --> 01:07:38,990
Have you touched
the wall yet?

1021
01:07:40,710 --> 01:07:42,950
No.

1022
01:07:48,190 --> 01:07:50,070
But you will.

1023
01:08:02,350 --> 01:08:03,590
Hey, Henry.

1024
01:08:03,670 --> 01:08:05,670
Hi.
- It's good to see you.

1025
01:08:05,750 --> 01:08:07,390
Funny.

1026
01:08:07,470 --> 01:08:08,870
It's good to see you too.

1027
01:08:08,950 --> 01:08:11,230
Oh, you,
you forgot these.

1028
01:08:11,310 --> 01:08:13,110
I wanted to return
those to you.

1029
01:08:14,350 --> 01:08:16,110
Thanks.

1030
01:08:16,190 --> 01:08:17,990
Don't really need them,
though.

1031
01:08:18,070 --> 01:08:20,950
Well.
- I guess they'll be a good souvenir...

1032
01:08:21,030 --> 01:08:23,310
- ... of my previous life.
- Yeah.

1033
01:08:24,670 --> 01:08:26,950
So have you talked
to your doctor yet,

1034
01:08:27,030 --> 01:08:29,150
your eye doctor?
- Not yet.

1035
01:08:29,230 --> 01:08:31,670
90 bucks for him to
tell me I'm 20/20.

1036
01:08:31,750 --> 01:08:33,150
Yeah.
- I already know that.

1037
01:08:33,230 --> 01:08:35,310
But, I mean, you got to think
about all the write-ups

1038
01:08:35,390 --> 01:08:37,470
in the medical journals.
Right?

1039
01:08:37,550 --> 01:08:39,870
You're still having
a pretty hard time buying into this,

1040
01:08:39,950 --> 01:08:41,870
- aren't you?
- You gotta admit that it's.

1041
01:08:41,950 --> 01:08:44,230
Do you know who
Noam Chomsky is?

1042
01:08:44,310 --> 01:08:45,830
The writer?
- Yeah.

1043
01:08:45,910 --> 01:08:47,990
He's a linguist too,
but...

1044
01:08:48,070 --> 01:08:50,150
once in an interview,
he said,

1045
01:08:50,230 --> 01:08:54,270
"When questions of decision,
reason or choice of action arise,

1046
01:08:54,350 --> 01:08:57,310
...human science
is at a loss. "

1047
01:08:57,390 --> 01:08:59,230
You actually believe that?

1048
01:08:59,310 --> 01:09:02,830
He meant that not everything
needs an explanation.

1049
01:09:02,910 --> 01:09:04,390
Sometimes things
just happen

1050
01:09:04,470 --> 01:09:07,430
because we choose
for them to.

1051
01:09:07,510 --> 01:09:10,750
I chose to believe.

1052
01:09:13,150 --> 01:09:14,750
Okay.

1053
01:09:17,310 --> 01:09:18,310
Thanks.

1054
01:09:18,390 --> 01:09:20,190
You're welcome.

1055
01:09:52,670 --> 01:09:54,750
Well, this is about
the loveliest thing

1056
01:09:54,830 --> 01:09:56,510
that I've ever seen.

1057
01:09:58,750 --> 01:10:01,190
I can't wait to see
what's for dinner.

1058
01:10:02,230 --> 01:10:03,790
Pizza!

1059
01:10:04,750 --> 01:10:06,790
Perfect.

1060
01:10:08,710 --> 01:10:12,550
This is, this is
very romantic, Henry.

1061
01:10:12,630 --> 01:10:14,830
Thanks.
- Really.

1062
01:10:14,910 --> 01:10:16,670
Plastic utensils.

1063
01:10:16,750 --> 01:10:18,790
Oh, yeah,
family heirlooms.

1064
01:10:29,190 --> 01:10:30,790
Can I ask you
something?

1065
01:10:30,870 --> 01:10:32,390
Sure.

1066
01:10:32,470 --> 01:10:35,310
The other night,
you came home kinda late

1067
01:10:35,390 --> 01:10:38,470
and...

1068
01:10:38,550 --> 01:10:40,230
You know what?
It doesn't matter.

1069
01:10:40,310 --> 01:10:41,750
It's fine.

1070
01:10:43,150 --> 01:10:45,390
You want to know
where I was.

1071
01:10:45,470 --> 01:10:46,630
Yes.

1072
01:10:46,710 --> 01:10:48,070
I can't tell you.

1073
01:10:50,190 --> 01:10:52,190
No, I.

1074
01:10:52,270 --> 01:10:54,190
I'd just gone
for a walk.

1075
01:10:54,270 --> 01:10:56,950
And it's kind of funny

1076
01:10:57,030 --> 01:11:00,750
'cause I'd just left the house
and started walking...

1077
01:11:00,830 --> 01:11:04,510
...and I, I don't even think I
really knew where I was going...

1078
01:11:04,590 --> 01:11:06,790
...till I got there.

1079
01:11:06,870 --> 01:11:08,470
Where did you go?

1080
01:11:08,550 --> 01:11:10,550
The river.

1081
01:11:10,630 --> 01:11:12,710
I, uh.

1082
01:11:12,790 --> 01:11:15,590
My parents,
they used to fight a lot.

1083
01:11:16,950 --> 01:11:20,030
So I would go down there

1084
01:11:20,110 --> 01:11:22,550
and even though it was
such a big place,

1085
01:11:22,630 --> 01:11:27,110
I always. I always just
kind of felt very safe there.

1086
01:11:27,190 --> 01:11:30,750
I'd kind of go there
and hide.

1087
01:11:30,830 --> 01:11:32,630
And that's why...

1088
01:11:32,710 --> 01:11:33,830
I came here.

1089
01:11:37,950 --> 01:11:40,110
So just like that,
you disappeared.

1090
01:11:44,510 --> 01:11:47,750
Since this thing
happened to me,

1091
01:11:47,830 --> 01:11:50,990
...every morning when I wake up,
the first thing I think about...

1092
01:11:51,070 --> 01:11:55,510
...is, I mean, after I figure out
if I'm still actually here or not.

1093
01:11:57,670 --> 01:11:59,950
The first thing I think about
is how much time

1094
01:12:00,030 --> 01:12:01,550
that I have left.

1095
01:12:01,630 --> 01:12:03,830
And all I can really do
is kind of...

1096
01:12:03,910 --> 01:12:05,830
wait for the end.

1097
01:12:08,750 --> 01:12:11,070
But this morning
when I woke up...

1098
01:12:12,950 --> 01:12:15,510
the first thing I
thought about was you.

1099
01:12:17,070 --> 01:12:19,030
And Millie.

1100
01:12:21,150 --> 01:12:23,710
I'm just trying
to say that...

1101
01:12:23,790 --> 01:12:27,750
...that I'm enjoying this.

1102
01:12:29,830 --> 01:12:33,350
I'm enjoying you
and being around you.

1103
01:12:36,070 --> 01:12:37,910
And I just...

1104
01:12:37,990 --> 01:12:40,510
...it's a surprise 'cause
I didn't ever think...

1105
01:12:40,590 --> 01:12:42,510
...that I'd feel this way.

1106
01:12:50,630 --> 01:12:52,430
Mommy?

1107
01:12:52,510 --> 01:12:55,150
Millie, what are you
doing up?

1108
01:12:55,230 --> 01:12:57,630
I can't sleep.

1109
01:12:57,710 --> 01:12:59,550
Where is Esperanza?

1110
01:12:59,630 --> 01:13:01,550
On the couch, snoring.

1111
01:13:01,630 --> 01:13:06,070
Okay, let's go inside.
Um, do me a favor.

1112
01:13:06,150 --> 01:13:08,630
Keep enjoying this.

1113
01:13:10,750 --> 01:13:12,950
All right, honey.
Come on.

1114
01:13:13,030 --> 01:13:14,870
Big sack of potatoes,
huh?

1115
01:13:14,950 --> 01:13:17,350
What are you doing
up so late, Millie?

1116
01:13:17,430 --> 01:13:19,030
It's a school night.

1117
01:13:26,110 --> 01:13:28,350
Okay, you want Jasper?

1118
01:13:28,430 --> 01:13:29,550
Here he is.

1119
01:13:30,710 --> 01:13:31,790
'Night.

1120
01:13:54,470 --> 01:13:56,150
Sorry about that.

1121
01:13:56,230 --> 01:13:58,990
It's like she doesn't want
to miss a thing now that.

1122
01:14:03,670 --> 01:14:06,030
You know...

1123
01:14:07,430 --> 01:14:09,910
I, I think maybe we should
just call it a night...

1124
01:14:09,990 --> 01:14:11,950
...because this isn't.

1125
01:14:12,030 --> 01:14:13,790
Henry.

1126
01:14:13,870 --> 01:14:16,550
Sorry, this just
isn't right.

1127
01:14:16,630 --> 01:14:18,190
What are you
talking about?

1128
01:14:18,270 --> 01:14:21,030
Just you, me and
everything

1129
01:14:21,110 --> 01:14:22,550
all at once.
I just, I'm sorry.

1130
01:14:22,630 --> 01:14:24,750
Hey, how can you
say that?

1131
01:14:28,350 --> 01:14:30,030
Henry.

1132
01:14:33,230 --> 01:14:35,790
I know you're
gonna die,

1133
01:14:40,710 --> 01:14:43,910
but all that either
of us have

1134
01:14:43,990 --> 01:14:45,750
is right now.

1135
01:14:45,830 --> 01:14:49,950
And we should pay
attention to that.

1136
01:14:59,830 --> 01:15:02,030
I am paying attention.

1137
01:15:04,670 --> 01:15:06,510
That's the problem.

1138
01:15:12,590 --> 01:15:14,590
I'm sorry.

1139
01:15:20,070 --> 01:15:25,310
<i>On an ocean white</i>

1140
01:15:27,310 --> 01:15:32,070
<i>Of roaring waves</i>

1141
01:15:34,110 --> 01:15:38,710
<i>I see your light</i>

1142
01:15:40,350 --> 01:15:45,630
<i>And golden face</i>

1143
01:15:48,190 --> 01:15:52,790
<i>A precious gift</i>

1144
01:15:53,910 --> 01:15:58,350
<i>Of your longing arms</i>

1145
01:16:00,310 --> 01:16:05,710
<i>Hurt me not</i>

1146
01:16:05,790 --> 01:16:10,230
<i>Just sing to me, my love</i>

1147
01:16:11,710 --> 01:16:16,510
<i>Ooh ooh</i>

1148
01:16:19,030 --> 01:16:23,310
<i>How come so</i>

1149
01:16:26,910 --> 01:16:31,510
<i>So</i>

1150
01:16:34,910 --> 01:16:40,550
<i>Sweetly, child, you sing?</i>

1151
01:16:43,910 --> 01:16:46,990
<i>And all the joy</i>

1152
01:16:47,070 --> 01:16:50,350
<i>You bring to me</i>

1153
01:16:52,310 --> 01:16:56,670
<i>Goes</i>

1154
01:16:59,670 --> 01:17:04,870
<i>Goes our loved ones home</i>

1155
01:17:10,030 --> 01:17:12,390
<i>And I will</i>

1156
01:17:12,470 --> 01:17:15,790
<i>I will be waiting.</i>

1157
01:17:27,190 --> 01:17:28,750
Henry!

1158
01:17:28,830 --> 01:17:31,190
What's going on?

1159
01:17:31,270 --> 01:17:33,710
It's Millie.
- What is it?

1160
01:17:34,830 --> 01:17:37,270
She's in here.

1161
01:17:37,350 --> 01:17:39,390
I mean, she's been
like this all morning.

1162
01:17:39,470 --> 01:17:42,430
She won't talk to me.
She won't look at me.

1163
01:17:42,510 --> 01:17:43,710
Nothing.

1164
01:17:53,310 --> 01:17:55,070
Millie?

1165
01:17:55,150 --> 01:17:57,110
Can you hear me?

1166
01:17:58,990 --> 01:18:01,190
Millie, you remember how
much fun we had the other day

1167
01:18:01,270 --> 01:18:02,950
when we played?

1168
01:18:03,030 --> 01:18:04,910
You remember that?

1169
01:18:07,390 --> 01:18:10,110
Please.
Please say something.

1170
01:18:21,230 --> 01:18:24,390
Henry's here.
He came over to play.

1171
01:18:24,470 --> 01:18:27,710
Sweetie?

1172
01:18:27,790 --> 01:18:30,310
Honey,
can you hear me?

1173
01:18:44,790 --> 01:18:48,630
Henry, I know you're gonna die.

1174
01:18:48,710 --> 01:18:52,950
But all that either of us
have is right now.

1175
01:18:55,150 --> 01:18:57,390
And we should pay
attention to that.

1176
01:19:05,910 --> 01:19:07,550
Was there any kind
of trauma?

1177
01:19:07,630 --> 01:19:10,830
Anything which could have
set her back like this?

1178
01:20:00,630 --> 01:20:02,470
You told me
"one time. "

1179
01:20:02,550 --> 01:20:04,070
You promised me.

1180
01:20:04,150 --> 01:20:06,790
Mr. Poole, God is
bigger than a promise.

1181
01:20:06,870 --> 01:20:08,550
Just let me talk to you,
yes?

1182
01:20:08,630 --> 01:20:10,110
Esperanza, please, let him go.
- No no no!

1183
01:20:10,190 --> 01:20:11,390
- Mr. Poole, just let us.
- Listen to me, please.

1184
01:20:11,470 --> 01:20:13,670
Listen to me!
Mr. Poole.

1185
01:20:16,670 --> 01:20:18,150
Holy shit.
- No no no no.

1186
01:20:18,230 --> 01:20:21,550
No "holy shit. " No "holy shit. "
Holy something else.

1187
01:20:21,630 --> 01:20:23,870
Mr. Poole,
the test came back.

1188
01:20:23,950 --> 01:20:26,230
Yeah, and what? And what?
There's no explanation for it, right?

1189
01:20:26,310 --> 01:20:27,670
No.
- It's a big surprise, huh?

1190
01:20:27,750 --> 01:20:29,270
- No no, please.
- Yes, you're right.

1191
01:20:29,350 --> 01:20:31,070
There is no explanation.
That's exactly right.

1192
01:20:31,150 --> 01:20:32,590
You want to tell me
what's going on?

1193
01:20:32,670 --> 01:20:34,750
Why all these people
are here? Huh?

1194
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:36,550
There here to see
something unexplainable.

1195
01:20:36,630 --> 01:20:38,310
Yeah?
- They're here to find some hope.

1196
01:20:38,390 --> 01:20:39,630
Let me tell you something.

1197
01:20:39,710 --> 01:20:41,630
I never should have let you
come here in the first place

1198
01:20:41,710 --> 01:20:43,470
'cause this is insane.
You got people praying to the wall.

1199
01:20:43,550 --> 01:20:45,510
Excuse me, is this your house?
- Yeah!

1200
01:20:45,590 --> 01:20:47,870
This is my house.
- You know, you're a very lucky man...

1201
01:20:47,950 --> 01:20:49,630
- ... to have such a.
- Yeah! Yeah, I'm so lucky

1202
01:20:49,710 --> 01:20:51,630
I ought to buy a lottery
ticket, shouldn't I?

1203
01:20:51,710 --> 01:20:53,190
You're all just kind of
staring at the wall?

1204
01:20:53,270 --> 01:20:54,710
Is that what you're doing?

1205
01:20:54,790 --> 01:20:56,390
Hope can't save you.

1206
01:20:56,470 --> 01:20:57,870
You understand that?

1207
01:20:57,950 --> 01:21:00,430
It can't save you.
Or her,

1208
01:21:00,510 --> 01:21:02,110
or her, or him!

1209
01:21:02,190 --> 01:21:04,990
You understand that?
Hope isn't gonna save you!

1210
01:21:05,070 --> 01:21:07,430
You know that.

1211
01:21:07,510 --> 01:21:10,230
Please, Mr. Poole.

1212
01:21:13,910 --> 01:21:16,190
No no no no no no, please.
Listen to me!

1213
01:21:16,270 --> 01:21:18,630
Listen, it's a miracle.
It will do things.

1214
01:21:18,710 --> 01:21:21,030
No no no no,
this is a gift from God!

1215
01:21:21,110 --> 01:21:23,230
This is a gift from God!
No no, oh my God.

1216
01:21:24,830 --> 01:21:27,230
I want this
out of here!

1217
01:21:27,310 --> 01:21:29,710
I don't want this stain
on my wall!

1218
01:21:32,670 --> 01:21:34,710
I want.

1219
01:21:37,710 --> 01:21:40,110
This doesn't save lives.

1220
01:21:42,270 --> 01:21:43,710
Please.

1221
01:21:43,790 --> 01:21:45,870
This doesn't save lives.

1222
01:21:46,870 --> 01:21:50,870
<i>Oooh</i>

1223
01:21:53,350 --> 01:21:59,190
<i>Sweetly, child, you sing</i>

1224
01:22:02,910 --> 01:22:06,070
<i>And all the joy</i>

1225
01:22:06,150 --> 01:22:08,750
<i>You bring to me</i>

1226
01:22:11,710 --> 01:22:15,310
<i>Goes</i>

1227
01:22:18,550 --> 01:22:23,630
<i>Goes our loved ones home</i>

1228
01:22:28,910 --> 01:22:30,870
<i>And I will</i>

1229
01:22:30,950 --> 01:22:35,030
<i>I will be waiting</i>

1230
01:22:39,310 --> 01:22:42,950
<i>On an ocean</i>

1231
01:22:45,870 --> 01:22:51,470
<i>Sweetly, child, you sing</i>

1232
01:22:54,750 --> 01:22:58,070
<i>On an ocean...</i>

1233
01:22:58,150 --> 01:23:00,750
Mr. Poole?

1234
01:23:02,270 --> 01:23:06,870
<i>On an ocean...</i>

1235
01:23:06,950 --> 01:23:08,470
Can you hear me?

1236
01:23:16,110 --> 01:23:20,390
Mr. Poole,
the blood was real.

1237
01:23:22,710 --> 01:23:26,190
<i>Ahhhhhhh</i>

1238
01:23:37,070 --> 01:23:41,990
<i>Sahhh ahhh ahhh</i>

1239
01:23:44,710 --> 01:23:49,310
<i>Sahhh ahhh ahhh.</i>

1240
01:23:53,910 --> 01:23:56,670
Oh, God.

1241
01:23:58,310 --> 01:23:59,950
Thank God you're okay.

1242
01:24:02,630 --> 01:24:04,110
What are you
doing here?

1243
01:24:04,150 --> 01:24:07,230
I've been waiting
for you to wake up

1244
01:24:07,310 --> 01:24:09,990
to make sure you're okay.

1245
01:24:12,910 --> 01:24:14,990
...Dios mio.

1246
01:24:16,150 --> 01:24:18,190
What are you
smiling at?

1247
01:24:18,270 --> 01:24:20,950
At you.

1248
01:24:21,030 --> 01:24:23,830
Why did you not tell me,
Mr. Poole?

1249
01:24:23,910 --> 01:24:25,430
Tell you what?

1250
01:24:25,470 --> 01:24:27,230
About your secret
you had.

1251
01:24:27,310 --> 01:24:29,190
Dawn explained it to me.

1252
01:24:31,510 --> 01:24:33,230
What do you mean, "had"?

1253
01:24:33,310 --> 01:24:35,390
I need to see a doctor!

1254
01:24:35,470 --> 01:24:37,750
Sir, you need to get back in your room.

1255
01:24:37,830 --> 01:24:39,390
I need to see a doctor.
- Sir!

1256
01:24:39,470 --> 01:24:41,350
Mr. Poole, no no no.
You should not be walking around.

1257
01:24:41,430 --> 01:24:43,190
You need to get back to
your room, hey hey!

1258
01:24:43,270 --> 01:24:45,950
Hey hey!
Mr. Poole.

1259
01:24:46,030 --> 01:24:48,550
Please, okay.
Mr. Poole, just calm down.

1260
01:24:48,630 --> 01:24:51,470
Mr. Poole.

1261
01:24:51,550 --> 01:24:53,550
No no no no.
No no, don't do that.

1262
01:24:53,630 --> 01:24:56,510
Mr. Poole, look at
your arm, Mr. Poole.

1263
01:24:56,590 --> 01:24:59,470
You're bleeding.
- Mr. Poole.

1264
01:25:03,750 --> 01:25:05,710
Please.

1265
01:25:06,950 --> 01:25:08,750
Please.

1266
01:25:27,230 --> 01:25:29,870
Mr. Poole.

1267
01:25:30,830 --> 01:25:32,870
Wake up.

1268
01:25:32,910 --> 01:25:35,430
Mr. Poole?
Wake up.

1269
01:25:35,470 --> 01:25:38,430
It's okay.
Wake up.

1270
01:25:43,790 --> 01:25:47,270
Millie, did you just
say something to me?

1271
01:25:47,390 --> 01:25:50,030
Mommy said you're not
sick anymore.

1272
01:25:56,270 --> 01:25:58,630
I'm.

1273
01:25:58,670 --> 01:26:00,630
I'm not gonna die?

1274
01:26:00,750 --> 01:26:02,470
No, Henry.

1275
01:26:02,590 --> 01:26:04,310
You're not.

1276
01:26:05,270 --> 01:26:06,750
How can that be?

1277
01:26:06,830 --> 01:26:10,110
Well, I told them what
was wrong with you

1278
01:26:10,150 --> 01:26:12,790
and they checked.
And you're fine.

1279
01:26:16,790 --> 01:26:18,830
You were never sick,
Henry.

1280
01:26:23,670 --> 01:26:27,430
So, so I was
never gonna die?

1281
01:26:27,470 --> 01:26:30,510
No no, we are all going to die,

1282
01:26:30,590 --> 01:26:32,230
just not right now.

1283
01:26:32,350 --> 01:26:35,910
And that is the miracle

1284
01:26:35,990 --> 01:26:37,590
for you.

1285
01:26:40,070 --> 01:26:41,950
Um...

1286
01:26:42,030 --> 01:26:44,190
after what I've done,

1287
01:26:44,270 --> 01:26:46,030
the miracle's gone.

1288
01:26:46,150 --> 01:26:48,270
No no no.

1289
01:26:48,310 --> 01:26:50,430
Don't worry about that.

1290
01:26:50,470 --> 01:26:53,310
It was here for
as long

1291
01:26:53,430 --> 01:26:55,350
as it needed
to be here.

1292
01:26:55,390 --> 01:26:56,790
Yeah?
- Yeah.

1293
01:26:56,910 --> 01:27:00,710
Like everything
and everyone.

1294
01:27:03,590 --> 01:27:06,350
I'm glad you're better,
Mr. Poole.

1295
01:27:10,070 --> 01:27:12,190
Millie,

1296
01:27:12,230 --> 01:27:14,070
I'm glad you're better too.

1297
01:27:20,870 --> 01:27:24,310
You know, you should really
get some rest.

1298
01:27:24,350 --> 01:27:26,230
Okay?

1299
01:27:26,270 --> 01:27:28,230
We'll be outside
if you need us.

1300
01:27:28,350 --> 01:27:30,110
Come on, honey.

1301
01:27:44,270 --> 01:27:48,710
<i>I promise you will get old</i>

1302
01:27:48,790 --> 01:27:53,150
<i>I promised you everything</i>

1303
01:27:53,230 --> 01:27:57,950
<i>To protect you wherever you go</i>

1304
01:27:58,070 --> 01:28:02,870
<i>I'll give you this diamond ring</i>

1305
01:28:02,990 --> 01:28:08,110
<i>Just promise you will remember</i>

1306
01:28:08,150 --> 01:28:11,510
<i>The promise should last forever</i>

1307
01:28:13,070 --> 01:28:17,550
<i>Right up to the dying embers</i>

1308
01:28:17,670 --> 01:28:21,510
<i>Of the fire that
burns so slow...</i>

1309
01:28:45,670 --> 01:28:48,030
You're back.
- Yep.

1310
01:28:50,870 --> 01:28:52,670
I'm home.

1311
01:28:52,710 --> 01:28:54,630
What's left of it.

1312
01:28:57,870 --> 01:28:59,390
What do you make
of all this?

1313
01:29:01,470 --> 01:29:02,990
You're gonna live,
Henry.

1314
01:29:03,110 --> 01:29:04,590
Yeah.

1315
01:29:04,670 --> 01:29:06,950
It's a gift.

1316
01:29:07,030 --> 01:29:08,190
Yeah.

1317
01:29:08,310 --> 01:29:10,230
Pretty miraculous,
huh?

1318
01:29:12,510 --> 01:29:15,710
I don't, I don't
know what it is.

1319
01:29:15,830 --> 01:29:18,430
I don't know if it
was a mistake.

1320
01:29:18,470 --> 01:29:20,030
I don't know.

1321
01:29:25,670 --> 01:29:28,190
I don't think that
any of this

1322
01:29:28,270 --> 01:29:29,750
was a mistake.

1323
01:29:34,750 --> 01:29:36,390
What now?

1324
01:30:04,150 --> 01:30:07,310
<i>It's a beautiful thing to do</i>

1325
01:30:09,030 --> 01:30:13,310
<i>Sometimes you just
have to walk away</i>

1326
01:30:13,430 --> 01:30:16,510
<i>Remember I do love you</i>

1327
01:30:18,350 --> 01:30:22,390
<i>Have courage in what you say</i>

1328
01:30:22,510 --> 01:30:27,230
<i>And promise you will remember</i>

1329
01:30:27,310 --> 01:30:31,710
<i>That promises last forever</i>

1330
01:30:31,750 --> 01:30:36,430
<i>Still after the dying embers</i>

1331
01:30:36,550 --> 01:30:41,110
<i>The fire that burns so slowly</i>

1332
01:30:50,350 --> 01:30:53,750
<i>Sometimes you just
have to walk away</i>

1333
01:30:59,510 --> 01:31:03,110
<i>Sometimes you just
have to walk away</i>

1334
01:31:08,670 --> 01:31:11,830
<i>Wishing today was yesterday</i>

1335
01:31:17,630 --> 01:31:21,190
<i>Yes, sometimes you just
have to walk away.</i>

1336
01:31:22,190 --> 01:31:32,190
