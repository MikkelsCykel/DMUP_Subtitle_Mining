1
00:00:24,489 --> 00:00:26,950
Oh, yeah. I've been round the block.

2
00:00:26,991 --> 00:00:28,785
- Really?
- Believe it.

3
00:00:29,285 --> 00:00:32,747
Sowed me oats.
Acted the rip, the rapscallion.

4
00:00:33,164 --> 00:00:35,375
Ran wild, ran free.

5
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,460
Of course, this all back
in the days of yore.

6
00:00:37,585 --> 00:00:40,547
Right. You wouldn't think it to look at you.

7
00:00:40,839 --> 00:00:44,717
Yeah, well, time comes, you have to
leave behind the old hell-raising.

8
00:00:45,009 --> 00:00:46,845
Take some responsibility for your life.

9
00:00:46,928 --> 00:00:48,888
- Prepare the groundwork.
- How do you do that?

10
00:00:48,972 --> 00:00:51,683
Well, to begin with,
I'd say by nest-building.

11
00:00:51,766 --> 00:00:53,977
You have to find an abode
you feel secure in.

12
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,687
Then you have to furnish that abode...

13
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:58,481
procure the necessaries: Furniture, etc.

14
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:00,859
Kitchen utensils, your wok...

15
00:01:01,234 --> 00:01:03,653
...your juicers.
- What about love?

16
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:08,491
Well, love's not something
you can plan for, is it?

17
00:01:08,616 --> 00:01:10,326
Look all you like as long as you like...

18
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:12,328
but it's only when you let
your guard down...

19
00:01:12,412 --> 00:01:14,831
- When you least expect...
- That you find someone.

20
00:01:14,873 --> 00:01:17,167
Take myself for example.
You ever see me before?

21
00:01:17,208 --> 00:01:18,334
No.

22
00:01:18,418 --> 00:01:22,338
I've just ambled in, right? But who's to say
by tomorrow, you and me couldn't...

23
00:01:22,422 --> 00:01:24,299
and I'm not coming on to you or anything...

24
00:01:24,382 --> 00:01:27,260
but who's to say
we couldn't be head-over-heels?

25
00:01:27,343 --> 00:01:28,428
Dancing in the Green?

26
00:01:28,511 --> 00:01:30,054
- Nobody.
- Right.

27
00:01:38,813 --> 00:01:40,773
- When there's something there...
- Chemistry.

28
00:01:40,857 --> 00:01:43,067
Right. Who knows
where the sparks will lead?

29
00:01:43,193 --> 00:01:44,694
A fella like myself, a stranger...

30
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:47,363
could just be a bit of fun in the sack,
no more.

31
00:01:47,488 --> 00:01:50,450
Or, and it's not that crazy...

32
00:01:51,075 --> 00:01:52,619
your soul mate.

33
00:01:54,662 --> 00:01:56,664
Yeah, you've got a point.

34
00:01:56,748 --> 00:01:59,459
On the other hand,
I could just be a thief or something.

35
00:01:59,584 --> 00:02:00,752
What do you mean?

36
00:02:00,835 --> 00:02:03,463
Some villain,
just waiting for my chance to...

37
00:02:05,006 --> 00:02:08,801
smack your jaw and rob the register
while the place is empty.

38
00:02:17,018 --> 00:02:19,062
But this is the thing of it, see?

39
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,273
You just never know...

40
00:02:26,152 --> 00:02:27,403
what's gonna happen.

41
00:02:32,116 --> 00:02:35,078
Come here. Look at your top!

42
00:02:35,328 --> 00:02:38,998
How many fucking times
do I have to tell you? It's all over you.

43
00:02:39,082 --> 00:02:40,166
What are you doing?

44
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:43,253
Get back over here
before I fucking slap you...

45
00:02:44,462 --> 00:02:45,922
Get out of the way!

46
00:02:46,005 --> 00:02:48,258
He's heading for the stairs.

47
00:02:49,467 --> 00:02:51,928
Come on, youse humpy cunts.

48
00:02:55,265 --> 00:02:56,724
Get out of my fucking way.

49
00:02:57,267 --> 00:02:58,726
He's running out to the car park.

50
00:03:01,271 --> 00:03:02,981
Come back here with that!

51
00:03:09,153 --> 00:03:10,864
Get out of the car!

52
00:03:10,947 --> 00:03:13,032
Get out of the fucking car!

53
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,980
Shouldn't you have been here
last time round?

54
00:03:44,022 --> 00:03:45,148
I should have, but fuck it.

55
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,357
An hour late.

56
00:03:46,441 --> 00:03:49,027
An hour less there, man. Fucking dump.

57
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:51,321
Don't start. You the same?

58
00:03:51,404 --> 00:03:55,450
Fucking bus, fucking city.
Here's this fuck now.

59
00:03:55,825 --> 00:03:59,287
- Is it too early to use my pass?
- You know it is.

60
00:03:59,871 --> 00:04:01,331
How much is it to the barn?

61
00:04:01,456 --> 00:04:04,834
You know how much.
Come on, there's people here late.

62
00:04:09,422 --> 00:04:11,174
Another 10 cents. Come on.

63
00:04:11,257 --> 00:04:12,884
- Will youse come on?
- Hold your...

64
00:04:12,967 --> 00:04:14,344
Hurry up.

65
00:04:14,469 --> 00:04:15,595
Now.

66
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:19,516
You robbing bastard, you.

67
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,896
- How's Cathy?
- She ordered in a kitchen.

68
00:04:25,688 --> 00:04:29,234
- You're joking. New floor not enough?
- Do you believe her?

69
00:04:29,359 --> 00:04:33,655
You wanna see this floor, though.
Oak slats, lovely grain running through it.

70
00:04:33,738 --> 00:04:37,534
Trouble is, this shit costs,
and there's only so much overtime going.

71
00:04:37,617 --> 00:04:40,161
- Fucking shit.
- It's all shit, man.

72
00:04:40,245 --> 00:04:41,704
Fucking life.

73
00:04:45,834 --> 00:04:49,128
Mega brand kidney beans,
baked beans, butter beans.

74
00:04:49,212 --> 00:04:52,757
Any two for the price of one.
It's a reduction rampage.

75
00:04:52,841 --> 00:04:56,094
- What did you say?
- I say, 'Why not?'

76
00:04:56,344 --> 00:05:00,265
She says, "Because you're not my type".
I say, "Well, what is your type?"

77
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:03,059
You know what she said?
"Everything you're not".

78
00:05:03,142 --> 00:05:04,185
Jesus.

79
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:07,730
Didn't score in a single department.
Fucking wank, man.

80
00:05:08,314 --> 00:05:10,108
- Next time?
- What?

81
00:05:10,692 --> 00:05:14,279
That's easy enough for you to say,
sitting pretty as you are, man.

82
00:05:14,445 --> 00:05:16,906
- What?
- Sitting pretty. You've Deirdre there...

83
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:19,701
Oscar, me and Deirdre broke up.

84
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,288
- What? When?
- Few weeks back.

85
00:05:23,997 --> 00:05:26,791
Weeks? Why didn't you tell me then?

86
00:05:30,837 --> 00:05:32,922
How the hell did it happen?

87
00:05:33,673 --> 00:05:36,301
It was felt we should take a bit of a break.

88
00:05:36,384 --> 00:05:38,803
Felt by who? By her, yeah?

89
00:05:39,596 --> 00:05:40,763
John.

90
00:05:41,389 --> 00:05:42,599
Oscar.

91
00:05:50,023 --> 00:05:52,317
Are youse not clocking back on?

92
00:05:52,609 --> 00:05:53,860
Oh, yeah.

93
00:06:01,201 --> 00:06:02,410
Hang on.

94
00:06:09,709 --> 00:06:12,003
Youse clocked on 15 minutes ago.

95
00:06:12,504 --> 00:06:15,340
Get back on that floor, youse little pups.

96
00:06:16,216 --> 00:06:18,927
That's a strike now against each of you.

97
00:06:19,802 --> 00:06:20,929
John.

98
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:27,852
That's your second,
after your lateness this morning.

99
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:32,232
One more, and a certain ass will be kicked.

100
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:36,819
I shit you not, as they say in the States.

101
00:06:41,741 --> 00:06:46,037
So, yeah, that was the only place left.
And it was cheap as well.

102
00:06:46,538 --> 00:06:49,916
But Henry wouldn't take it
because they rape white women there.

103
00:06:49,999 --> 00:06:52,460
- Who does?
- I don't know. Everyone.

104
00:06:52,669 --> 00:06:55,255
Henry said some fella he knows
was driving round there...

105
00:06:55,338 --> 00:06:57,757
him and his girlfriend.
They were stopped by the cops.

106
00:06:57,841 --> 00:07:01,636
One held a gun on him, the other one
raped her. And then they switched.

107
00:07:01,761 --> 00:07:03,763
- They raped him, too?
- No.

108
00:07:03,888 --> 00:07:06,224
- Oh, the coppers switched.
- Yeah.

109
00:07:06,432 --> 00:07:10,144
So you know, that's that. No sun this year.

110
00:07:10,645 --> 00:07:14,440
Might go down to Wexford or something.
What about you and...

111
00:07:17,944 --> 00:07:20,405
Did you ever smell these?
Smell lovely, they do.

112
00:07:20,446 --> 00:07:21,948
Me and Deirdre?

113
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:25,159
- Youse broke up, didn't you?
- How did you know?

114
00:07:25,243 --> 00:07:29,038
That's all right then. I saw her
with some fella at the Zombie last night.

115
00:07:29,122 --> 00:07:29,873
Who?

116
00:07:29,956 --> 00:07:33,168
Some middle-aged fella. Kissing.
Some baldy fella.

117
00:07:34,043 --> 00:07:37,213
- Kissing a baldy fella?
- Holding hands and all, yeah.

118
00:07:37,297 --> 00:07:38,965
Wexford isn't that bad, is it?

119
00:07:39,048 --> 00:07:42,010
Get a caravan down there,
couple of weeks. What do you think?

120
00:07:42,093 --> 00:07:44,888
If the sun comes out, sure we can paddle.

121
00:07:46,556 --> 00:07:49,601
John. Come on, man.

122
00:08:05,867 --> 00:08:09,078
Where is the baldy cunt? Where is he?

123
00:08:09,746 --> 00:08:11,289
Sorry, Deirdre.

124
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:33,102
This isn't acceptable, Deirdre.

125
00:08:33,186 --> 00:08:37,023
After what, five, six weeks?
This is bollocks.

126
00:08:37,315 --> 00:08:39,108
You don't fucking...

127
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:45,823
You don't just hook up
with the next fella walks by!

128
00:08:46,157 --> 00:08:49,953
The only reason you would do that
is if you never cared the first place.

129
00:08:49,994 --> 00:08:52,247
And that's cold, man.

130
00:08:52,413 --> 00:08:54,040
That is the behavior of...

131
00:08:54,165 --> 00:08:57,210
and I have no qualms about saying it,
a whore.

132
00:08:57,335 --> 00:09:00,797
And not with a heart of gold.
No, with a heart of stone.

133
00:09:00,964 --> 00:09:04,509
A cold, dark fucking black heart, Deirdre.

134
00:09:04,592 --> 00:09:08,721
That's what you have. And I'm glad
I found out. A dirty, black...

135
00:09:08,805 --> 00:09:12,267
- Does 'blackguard' come from blackheart?
- Don't know, man. You all right?

136
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:15,436
You blackguard, Deirdre.
That's all you are. Do you hear me?

137
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,856
Just a dirty fucking blackguard.

138
00:09:18,982 --> 00:09:20,984
The body compensates, son.

139
00:09:21,109 --> 00:09:23,778
Instead of mobility,
I've increased perception:

140
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,322
Sight and sound, smell, of course.

141
00:09:26,364 --> 00:09:29,450
It's a fair trade, and I wouldn't go back.

142
00:09:30,493 --> 00:09:32,829
Come on. Come on, a sup.

143
00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:40,336
Taste, that's another one.

144
00:09:41,296 --> 00:09:44,132
- Have you ever tasted Guinness?
- Of course.

145
00:09:44,215 --> 00:09:45,383
No you haven't.

146
00:09:45,884 --> 00:09:47,760
You think you have.

147
00:09:48,344 --> 00:09:50,471
Listen, I've gotta go, man.

148
00:09:51,556 --> 00:09:54,350
Sorry and all, but my arm is fucked.

149
00:10:01,524 --> 00:10:03,985
- All right, boys.
- We're not holding your pint.

150
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:05,236
Why not?

151
00:10:05,361 --> 00:10:09,115
- Because then we've to listen to you.
- Wise to my ploys, aren't youse?

152
00:10:09,991 --> 00:10:12,202
I thought it was her
who wanted to take the break.

153
00:10:12,243 --> 00:10:14,329
How're you, Seamus?
Two brown sauce sambos.

154
00:10:14,412 --> 00:10:16,873
Slap it on thick, no butter,
two pints of Guinness.

155
00:10:16,915 --> 00:10:18,750
- Right.
- Know what I mean?

156
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:20,376
No, it was me.

157
00:10:21,252 --> 00:10:23,796
I just thought I'd give her a little test,
you know?

158
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,217
I say to her, "Let's take a break".
She says, "Let's not".

159
00:10:27,258 --> 00:10:28,593
Then I know, see?

160
00:10:28,676 --> 00:10:30,053
- John.
- What?

161
00:10:30,094 --> 00:10:31,971
What kind of fuckhead are you?

162
00:10:32,055 --> 00:10:35,058
- That pisses me all the way off.
- Why?

163
00:10:35,183 --> 00:10:38,144
Could you not appreciate
what you fucking had?

164
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:40,730
I'm at a stage, man, I can't even wank.

165
00:10:40,855 --> 00:10:42,607
Two brown sauce sambos.

166
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:44,609
- You know?
- Cheers, Seamus.

167
00:10:44,692 --> 00:10:47,070
Pulling away like a madman, man.

168
00:10:47,111 --> 00:10:48,488
Two pints.

169
00:10:49,072 --> 00:10:52,325
Half an hour, 45 minutes,
nothing fucking happens.

170
00:10:54,035 --> 00:10:56,746
Can't get my fantasies clear in my head.

171
00:10:58,081 --> 00:11:00,625
Couple of occasions,
I don't mind telling you...

172
00:11:00,792 --> 00:11:03,753
I wept like a woman,
the fucking frustration.

173
00:11:04,504 --> 00:11:06,464
So you setting tests for Deirdre, man...

174
00:11:06,548 --> 00:11:08,633
taking for granted
your good fucking fortune...

175
00:11:08,758 --> 00:11:10,927
that disappoints me big style.

176
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,978
- I'm gonna go home, you mind?
- You're what?

177
00:11:20,186 --> 00:11:23,481
What you said there is right, man.
Hundred per cent.

178
00:11:24,023 --> 00:11:27,735
- You've just sent me into a state of turmoil.
- Wistful, are you?

179
00:11:27,819 --> 00:11:29,654
Among other emotions.

180
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:34,993
- Need to go home and reflect on my choices.
- You do what you have to do, man.

181
00:11:40,331 --> 00:11:41,541
See you.

182
00:11:48,298 --> 00:11:49,841
Fair play, man.

183
00:11:49,966 --> 00:11:52,177
Right. Throw us on the floor.

184
00:11:55,388 --> 00:11:56,598
Gently.

185
00:12:00,935 --> 00:12:02,145
Lovely.

186
00:12:09,444 --> 00:12:12,530
Come here and I'll tell you. You there!

187
00:12:13,072 --> 00:12:16,242
- So how goes the fight against crime?
- All right.

188
00:12:16,826 --> 00:12:19,245
It's never-fucking-ending, though.

189
00:12:26,836 --> 00:12:28,421
See what I mean?

190
00:12:28,713 --> 00:12:32,759
Have you not got a sign that says,
'Toilets for patrons' use only'?

191
00:12:32,842 --> 00:12:33,927
I do.

192
00:12:34,802 --> 00:12:37,138
I'll have to enforce that rule.

193
00:12:40,225 --> 00:12:42,769
Give us another 7-UP there, will you?

194
00:12:48,608 --> 00:12:50,318
All right, Lehiff?

195
00:12:51,236 --> 00:12:53,154
Staying out of trouble?

196
00:12:54,656 --> 00:12:59,160
Jesus. Doesn't look like it.
Who did that to you?

197
00:13:01,162 --> 00:13:04,541
Your old one, man.
She poked me in the eye with her cock.

198
00:13:06,084 --> 00:13:08,253
You cheeky little fuck, you.

199
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:13,049
I'm watching you, do you hear me?

200
00:13:13,174 --> 00:13:16,511
And if I find out
that you've been in any way bold...

201
00:13:16,594 --> 00:13:18,263
I'm gonna nab you.

202
00:13:19,931 --> 00:13:21,474
Now don't move.

203
00:13:23,768 --> 00:13:26,604
Stay where you are and take your scolding.

204
00:13:39,701 --> 00:13:42,495
Now, what do I want you to do?

205
00:13:43,746 --> 00:13:45,540
Stay out of trouble.

206
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,128
Stay out of trouble.

207
00:13:51,671 --> 00:13:53,131
That's right.

208
00:13:53,965 --> 00:13:58,136
Fucking disrespect my old one.
Now, hang on till I shake.

209
00:14:04,517 --> 00:14:05,810
All right.

210
00:14:07,812 --> 00:14:08,980
Go on.

211
00:14:24,037 --> 00:14:27,832
So what's wrong with me? What did I do?

212
00:14:28,082 --> 00:14:30,835
- Or didn't I do?
- I told you, Noeleen, nothing.

213
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:33,129
- It's just something that...
- Yeah, that happened.

214
00:14:33,213 --> 00:14:36,049
You said that already,
and I don't believe you.

215
00:14:36,466 --> 00:14:37,926
Is it my age?

216
00:14:38,468 --> 00:14:42,722
Is it something I wouldn't do?
Is it my looks?

217
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:45,934
Wait a second. Look, don't you...

218
00:14:46,017 --> 00:14:49,103
Wait! Don't you fancy me anymore?

219
00:14:49,187 --> 00:14:51,189
Look. Listen to me.

220
00:14:51,856 --> 00:14:53,816
It's nothing to do with you.

221
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:57,904
I fancy her, I fell for her.
We clicked, and we wanna be together.

222
00:14:58,238 --> 00:15:01,074
You don't come into the equation, so relax.

223
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:07,121
Of course I come into the equation.
I'm your wife, for God's sake!

224
00:15:07,413 --> 00:15:11,251
I'm your wife, Sam! 14 years!

225
00:15:12,043 --> 00:15:14,170
What the hell did I do?

226
00:15:18,758 --> 00:15:21,553
- So this fella's moving in with you?
- Yes.

227
00:15:21,803 --> 00:15:24,389
Well, what do you want me to do?
Be like Sally?

228
00:15:24,472 --> 00:15:26,599
Give up on them altogether,
grow myself a 'tache?

229
00:15:26,683 --> 00:15:29,060
- Sally doesn't...
- Sally has a 'tache, Ma.

230
00:15:29,143 --> 00:15:33,064
Whatever she did before,
bleached or waxed, she's quit.

231
00:15:33,857 --> 00:15:35,859
Anyway, I'm better off.

232
00:15:36,693 --> 00:15:40,488
Did you know John and Oscar
broke into Fruitfield a few months back...

233
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:45,201
stole a crate load of Chef Sauce?
And I know that wasn't the only time.

234
00:15:45,285 --> 00:15:47,912
- Chef Sauce?
- It was all they could get.

235
00:15:47,996 --> 00:15:51,374
I'd be over at his place,
he's making sauce sandwiches.

236
00:15:51,457 --> 00:15:53,835
Putting it in his cornflakes.

237
00:15:53,918 --> 00:15:56,713
Trying to use it all up. In his tea.

238
00:15:57,046 --> 00:16:01,050
I mean, he dumps me, Ma, breaks my heart...

239
00:16:01,217 --> 00:16:04,679
and then has the gall to come over
and call me a whore and a blackguard...

240
00:16:04,762 --> 00:16:07,307
for not taking the fucking vows?
Well, fuck him.

241
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:10,226
Him and his brown sauce. Sorry, Ma.

242
00:16:11,144 --> 00:16:14,689
But I've got a guy who's well-off,
who's attractive...

243
00:16:14,772 --> 00:16:17,066
- Who's married.
- Well, you can't have it all.

244
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:20,195
Who's not a thief, but a bank manager.

245
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:23,031
And if he wants to move in with me...

246
00:16:23,072 --> 00:16:26,409
then I think
I'd be some kind of a fool to say no.

247
00:16:28,244 --> 00:16:32,540
Now, I'm gonna have the carrot cake.
What are you having?

248
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:37,253
All right, my friends, do Daddy proud.

249
00:16:37,462 --> 00:16:39,506
Show them what you've got.

250
00:16:41,382 --> 00:16:43,384
All right. You lads ready?

251
00:16:44,552 --> 00:16:45,929
And action!

252
00:16:52,185 --> 00:16:55,063
Come on, guys,
we've been through this before.

253
00:16:55,104 --> 00:16:57,774
They'll get it, lads,
just give them a second.

254
00:16:57,815 --> 00:17:01,110
Don't fuck up on me here. Go!

255
00:17:02,445 --> 00:17:06,824
For fuck's sake, how many times
have we rehearsed this, youse fucks. Go!

256
00:17:11,454 --> 00:17:14,833
Get down. Martin, get back in the box.

257
00:17:17,252 --> 00:17:19,629
Don't fight. Benny, get off him.

258
00:17:23,007 --> 00:17:25,802
- It is Little Big City, isn't it?
- Yeah.

259
00:17:25,885 --> 00:17:27,262
That's what it's called.

260
00:17:27,303 --> 00:17:30,390
Which says to me,
yeah, stories, yeah, characters.

261
00:17:30,473 --> 00:17:32,642
- There's a broad spectrum there.
- Diverse.

262
00:17:32,725 --> 00:17:34,727
And that's what we're doing and that's fine.

263
00:17:34,811 --> 00:17:37,981
But where that diversity is lacking is tone.

264
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:41,526
- What are you saying?
- Tone, Thomas. Texture.

265
00:17:41,609 --> 00:17:44,112
What I'm saying is,
let's go a bit darker now and again.

266
00:17:44,195 --> 00:17:46,489
Find a subject
with a little bit more of an edge...

267
00:17:46,573 --> 00:17:49,158
and explore that edge
with the weight it deserves.

268
00:17:49,284 --> 00:17:50,910
What do you think?

269
00:17:51,327 --> 00:17:53,329
- A bit darker?
- Just a bit.

270
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:58,001
Just to spice the thing up.
Give it some depth, some complexity...

271
00:17:58,084 --> 00:17:59,836
I know what you mean.

272
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:05,466
All right.

273
00:18:05,842 --> 00:18:08,303
Go find a subject, bring it to me.

274
00:18:08,845 --> 00:18:12,223
If it's not too much,
then I don't see why not.

275
00:18:13,683 --> 00:18:16,519
- Good enough?
- Absolutely.

276
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,199
What about this, Sally?

277
00:18:30,116 --> 00:18:32,952
When's the last time you saw me in a dress?

278
00:18:33,578 --> 00:18:35,205
Give me a voucher.

279
00:18:36,164 --> 00:18:37,999
A gift voucher, please.

280
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:39,667
- How much?
- Sorry?

281
00:18:40,627 --> 00:18:42,921
- How much for?
- €100, please.

282
00:18:43,004 --> 00:18:46,299
- No hundreds left. Do you want two fifties?
- Please.

283
00:18:51,012 --> 00:18:53,848
- No fifties. Five twenties do you?
- Fine.

284
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:09,531
Grab it.

285
00:19:18,206 --> 00:19:19,958
It's a sty, my life.

286
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,338
The people I deal with are piss. Waste.
Is that what you're interested in?

287
00:19:25,421 --> 00:19:28,132
I'm a fuck, man. I mean...

288
00:19:28,216 --> 00:19:33,012
my only really human quality to speak of
is a fondness for Celtic mysticism.

289
00:19:33,763 --> 00:19:35,139
What's that?

290
00:19:36,641 --> 00:19:38,142
The music, man.

291
00:19:38,935 --> 00:19:40,395
Artistes like...

292
00:19:40,436 --> 00:19:44,899
Fainne Lasta, Raithneach,
Amhann na Ngealach, Clannad.

293
00:19:45,942 --> 00:19:50,238
You like them artistes?
Their music? Of course you do.

294
00:19:51,698 --> 00:19:55,952
But what I'm saying is,
the kind of justice I'm questing...

295
00:19:56,286 --> 00:19:59,247
requires a certain attitude
that people might find...

296
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:01,666
you know, extreme or unpleasant.

297
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:04,627
It might not be suitable.

298
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:06,171
Grab it.

299
00:20:12,677 --> 00:20:15,346
- You ever compete?
- Just as a kid.

300
00:20:16,639 --> 00:20:18,224
I could have turned pro...

301
00:20:18,308 --> 00:20:21,728
except for I joined the Guards,
made crime my calling.

302
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:27,859
My da used to say, "Hate your opponent".

303
00:20:29,235 --> 00:20:30,904
He was my trainer.

304
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:34,866
'Hate him,
and you'll never give less than 100%.'

305
00:20:36,659 --> 00:20:39,162
That's a philosophy I still follow.

306
00:20:40,413 --> 00:20:42,916
That's why I'm such an animal, man.

307
00:20:44,459 --> 00:20:47,337
- Is that what you want for your show?
- Yes.

308
00:20:47,504 --> 00:20:49,839
- Cool.
- It's exactly what I want.

309
00:20:50,173 --> 00:20:53,468
I just have to run it by my boss.
Get the go off him and then we can...

310
00:20:53,551 --> 00:20:58,014
Run it by him.
Let him know I'm up for it, big time.

311
00:20:58,223 --> 00:21:00,600
Fucking underbelly, you're saying?

312
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:07,148
No better fucking guide, man.

313
00:22:04,455 --> 00:22:06,541
- You nearly finished?
- Midnight. Yourself?

314
00:22:06,624 --> 00:22:08,877
- About 10 minutes.
- You lucky prick.

315
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,504
Gonna pick up
a chicken black bean, spring roll starter...

316
00:22:11,588 --> 00:22:13,548
Will you come on? We've homes to go to.

317
00:22:13,631 --> 00:22:15,091
- Do you hear this?
- I know.

318
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:17,260
You'd think we were dogs or something.

319
00:22:17,385 --> 00:22:20,722
- Are we moving or what?
- Will youse wait a minute?

320
00:22:21,264 --> 00:22:22,307
Fuck's sake.

321
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:24,517
Listen, take it easy, yeah?

322
00:22:28,354 --> 00:22:29,856
Where are we?

323
00:22:31,357 --> 00:22:32,734
I can't see.

324
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:35,820
We near Springfield yet?

325
00:22:36,321 --> 00:22:38,198
I'll give you a shout.

326
00:22:39,073 --> 00:22:42,952
I was thinking we'd throw you
a birthday party. What do you think?

327
00:22:43,036 --> 00:22:46,831
I don't want one, Ma.
Don't believe in that party fandangle.

328
00:22:57,175 --> 00:23:00,178
Deirdre feels
you're letting yourself go, Sally.

329
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:03,765
Deirdre wants to hook me up
because she's embarrassed I've no fella.

330
00:23:03,848 --> 00:23:08,686
At least I'm not in their thrall like she is.
She escapes one, and another one nets her.

331
00:23:10,396 --> 00:23:12,524
What's the story with that, anyway?

332
00:23:12,607 --> 00:23:13,733
What?

333
00:23:14,692 --> 00:23:17,070
Any chance of them two
getting back together again?

334
00:23:17,153 --> 00:23:19,030
None of your business.

335
00:23:19,155 --> 00:23:20,198
No.

336
00:23:26,704 --> 00:23:30,917
And listen, I wasn't going to say it to you,
but since we're having this discussion...

337
00:23:30,959 --> 00:23:32,335
would you not...

338
00:23:35,588 --> 00:23:38,174
Would you not get yourself
a bit of Immac or something?

339
00:23:38,258 --> 00:23:41,219
Get rid of that old ronnie
you're cultivating.

340
00:23:41,261 --> 00:23:42,637
I haven't got a ronnie.

341
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,723
Well, no, you're hardly
the Burt Reynolds league...

342
00:23:45,765 --> 00:23:47,934
but there's such a thing as grooming,
you know?

343
00:23:48,017 --> 00:23:50,603
Whether you're courting or not, love.

344
00:23:51,229 --> 00:23:53,314
Springfield coming up, now.

345
00:24:00,321 --> 00:24:01,406
Mum?

346
00:24:04,534 --> 00:24:06,202
Mustn't be back yet.

347
00:24:15,962 --> 00:24:17,547
Are you nervous?

348
00:24:18,131 --> 00:24:19,465
Not really.

349
00:24:20,175 --> 00:24:22,218
They'll be well impressed.

350
00:24:23,303 --> 00:24:25,972
Take your coat off. I'll make some tea.

351
00:24:39,485 --> 00:24:41,696
- Deirdre.
- Yeah.

352
00:24:44,657 --> 00:24:46,868
Come here for a sec, will you?

353
00:24:48,328 --> 00:24:50,413
I wanna show you something.

354
00:24:59,464 --> 00:25:01,341
- Jesus.
- You must be Sam.

355
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:04,719
Christ.

356
00:25:06,221 --> 00:25:10,266
There were nine, ten people at the most.
All the windows were smashed.

357
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:13,311
So it was just a matter of
climbing up on to the top.

358
00:25:13,353 --> 00:25:16,981
Well, of Sally climbing up on to the top,
and of her helping them out...

359
00:25:17,065 --> 00:25:18,525
and me helping them down.

360
00:25:18,566 --> 00:25:20,026
- And there was nobody killed?
- No.

361
00:25:20,109 --> 00:25:22,612
- Despite the blood.
- That's amazing.

362
00:25:22,987 --> 00:25:26,699
- So the ambulance came and...
- Yep, took them all away and that was that.

363
00:25:26,783 --> 00:25:29,285
Made a statement to the police,
but we weren't much use.

364
00:25:29,369 --> 00:25:31,496
You don't know how it happened?

365
00:25:37,043 --> 00:25:39,504
- Have I got a ronnie?
- A what?

366
00:25:39,546 --> 00:25:42,757
- A ronnie, mustache, like.
- Show?

367
00:25:46,553 --> 00:25:50,348
Well, you're no Tom Selleck, but...

368
00:25:50,557 --> 00:25:52,183
Go fuck yourself.

369
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:55,186
Sorry, Ma. Fucking idiot.

370
00:25:55,228 --> 00:25:57,230
Why are you so angry, Sally?

371
00:25:57,313 --> 00:25:58,982
Because she's no business, that's why.

372
00:25:59,065 --> 00:26:01,693
I don't go round
talking about her physical...

373
00:26:13,621 --> 00:26:14,831
Jesus.

374
00:26:24,674 --> 00:26:26,968
You don't know how it happened?

375
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:29,679
Be a few settlements there, I'd say.

376
00:26:29,762 --> 00:26:32,932
- You should've stayed on till the next stop.
- We should've.

377
00:26:33,016 --> 00:26:35,435
Anyway, it's nice to meet you, Sam.

378
00:26:35,518 --> 00:26:40,064
Sorry it had to be in, what would you call it,
such dramatic circumstances.

379
00:26:40,148 --> 00:26:43,902
So, how are you finding living with Deirdre?
Her place okay?

380
00:26:44,444 --> 00:26:47,030
- He thinks it's a sty.
- No, I don't.

381
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,240
It just needs a bit of a dusting,
hat's all.

382
00:26:49,365 --> 00:26:52,452
- And a hoovering, and a mopping.
- Maybe a paint job.

383
00:26:52,535 --> 00:26:54,287
Ouch. I'm messing.

384
00:26:54,412 --> 00:26:58,917
No, it's great. It's early days,
but we're getting on all right, aren't we?

385
00:26:59,334 --> 00:27:02,086
- And how's your wife coping with this?
- Sally.

386
00:27:02,212 --> 00:27:05,340
No, I'd like to know.
Is she upset? Depressed?

387
00:27:07,217 --> 00:27:09,260
- Let's go, Sam.
- No, wait a sec, Deirdre.

388
00:27:09,344 --> 00:27:11,012
If he can't handle this kind of talk...

389
00:27:11,095 --> 00:27:13,139
then he shouldn't put himself
in this position.

390
00:27:13,223 --> 00:27:16,017
- How long you married?
- Fourteen years.

391
00:27:16,351 --> 00:27:20,313
And you can, just like that,
finish with one, start with another?

392
00:27:22,857 --> 00:27:26,152
That kind of shit sickens me,
you know that?

393
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,615
Sorry, Ma.

394
00:27:30,865 --> 00:27:33,827
And you stay where you are. I'll go.

395
00:27:34,661 --> 00:27:37,372
The stench of fucking adultery in here.

396
00:27:41,167 --> 00:27:44,671
When Vincent and I broke up,
I thought the same thing, Noeleen.

397
00:27:44,712 --> 00:27:45,964
It's me.

398
00:27:46,214 --> 00:27:50,176
I'm dysfunctional in some way
because I couldn't hold on to him.

399
00:27:50,718 --> 00:27:53,847
So you know what I did?
I proved to myself that it wasn't...

400
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:56,891
by attempting,
by doing things that proved it.

401
00:27:57,559 --> 00:28:00,895
By becoming better alone
than I'd ever been with him.

402
00:28:02,021 --> 00:28:04,274
- Tell me how.
- I will.

403
00:28:05,233 --> 00:28:06,276
Will you?

404
00:28:07,068 --> 00:28:08,570
I can't tell the difference.

405
00:28:08,611 --> 00:28:10,238
- What do you want?
- Anything.

406
00:28:10,321 --> 00:28:12,699
Do you have a preference
in terms of content?

407
00:28:12,782 --> 00:28:16,327
Like women and women,
or men and men?

408
00:28:16,995 --> 00:28:18,705
What the fuck are you insinuating?

409
00:28:18,788 --> 00:28:21,916
I don't know your preferences.
I'm only trying to help you here.

410
00:28:21,958 --> 00:28:25,170
- You just want straight, yeah?
- Just people fucking, man.

411
00:28:25,295 --> 00:28:26,921
Make sure the chicks are good-looking.

412
00:28:27,005 --> 00:28:29,340
I saw one of them before,
they were hound dogs.

413
00:28:29,424 --> 00:28:31,759
- There you go.
- Mutts, they were.

414
00:28:32,635 --> 00:28:34,596
There's no one taking dumps in this,
is there?

415
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:36,639
- You want that?
- No.

416
00:28:37,515 --> 00:28:40,351
Look, Oscar, it's just fucking, all right?

417
00:28:40,435 --> 00:28:44,022
- Bit of oral, bit of anal.
- All right.

418
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:47,609
Anal men or anal women?

419
00:29:07,587 --> 00:29:10,215
Can't keep your paws off her, can you?

420
00:29:19,849 --> 00:29:21,392
So what happened to your sister?

421
00:29:21,476 --> 00:29:25,522
She was in love with this guy
and she wanted to marry him.

422
00:29:25,813 --> 00:29:28,233
Guy from London, name was Duane.

423
00:29:28,525 --> 00:29:30,652
She was gonna move there with him.

424
00:29:30,735 --> 00:29:35,031
Took out her savings for a new start.
A few thousand pounds.

425
00:29:35,365 --> 00:29:38,034
Well, you can see where this is going,
can't you?

426
00:29:38,117 --> 00:29:40,662
He convinced her to take it out in cash.

427
00:29:40,745 --> 00:29:44,040
Then he stole it from her
and went back himself.

428
00:29:46,042 --> 00:29:49,963
Jesus, Deirdre, get away.
You're freezing! Please, I'm serious.

429
00:29:51,881 --> 00:29:55,009
Thing is, though, after he took the money...

430
00:29:55,218 --> 00:29:58,888
he tied her to her bed,
told her she was a rubbish lay...

431
00:29:58,972 --> 00:30:02,225
...and then did a poo on her chest.
- A what?

432
00:30:02,392 --> 00:30:03,726
Ma found her.

433
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:07,772
It was like two or three days later,
and the stink, she said.

434
00:30:08,064 --> 00:30:11,192
Flies crawling over her, and her hysterical.

435
00:30:11,985 --> 00:30:15,572
So she moved back home then.
Hasn't trusted a man since.

436
00:30:16,406 --> 00:30:17,615
Jesus!

437
00:30:18,741 --> 00:30:20,243
Why would you?

438
00:30:21,786 --> 00:30:23,413
Are you warm yet?

439
00:30:24,497 --> 00:30:26,124
Yes, you are.

440
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,130
Get off!

441
00:31:31,105 --> 00:31:32,357
Bastard.

442
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,985
Fucking bastard.

443
00:32:21,156 --> 00:32:25,160
I'm telling you,
this young fella came out of nowhere.

444
00:32:25,785 --> 00:32:29,831
He threw a stone through the windscreen,
a big one.

445
00:32:31,457 --> 00:32:35,253
- I panicked, I swerved...
- You lost control.

446
00:32:35,712 --> 00:32:39,674
Anyone would have. The bang, the shock,
Jesus, the windscreen shattering.

447
00:32:39,757 --> 00:32:43,303
And yet no one saw this boy?

448
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:46,848
- None of your passengers?
- Are you joking me?

449
00:32:46,931 --> 00:32:49,350
With the muck on those windows,
how could they?

450
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:51,895
They can't even see the bus stops.

451
00:32:53,938 --> 00:32:56,774
I have not been negligent, man.
No way. I did nothing wrong.

452
00:32:56,858 --> 00:32:59,861
Kid ran up in front of me
and hauled that rock.

453
00:33:02,113 --> 00:33:04,115
Fucking pegged it, he did.

454
00:33:09,579 --> 00:33:12,207
The weather seems to be
pretty much the same...

455
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:14,209
as it's been for the past couple of days...

456
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:16,169
with the wind coming up
from the south-east.

457
00:33:16,252 --> 00:33:18,254
We've got squalls, sunshine patches.

458
00:33:18,338 --> 00:33:20,507
We've got fairly heavy rain.

459
00:33:21,925 --> 00:33:25,053
Dublin's gonna get
a lot of rain this afternoon.

460
00:33:28,973 --> 00:33:30,433
- Hey, man.
- Hi.

461
00:33:31,017 --> 00:33:34,312
- What you up to? You not working?
- Not anymore.

462
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:36,898
What?

463
00:33:37,649 --> 00:33:39,484
Did you get let go?

464
00:33:39,776 --> 00:33:42,028
- Fired.
- Fuck.

465
00:33:43,154 --> 00:33:45,156
That's mean. You okay?

466
00:33:46,699 --> 00:33:48,493
You want another one?

467
00:33:49,911 --> 00:33:52,539
I don't intend stopping any time soon.

468
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:57,126
- What happened to you?
- Some fuck, man, don't ask.

469
00:33:58,211 --> 00:34:01,130
Some little fucker.
I was driving up by Greenhills.

470
00:34:01,297 --> 00:34:03,299
Stroked jammer? Of course.

471
00:34:03,591 --> 00:34:04,551
Comes out of nowhere...

472
00:34:04,676 --> 00:34:07,178
...fucks a rock through the windscreen.
- What?

473
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:11,224
Into the ditch I went, banjaxed my face.
Do you believe it?

474
00:34:13,977 --> 00:34:15,645
Two pints, please.

475
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:21,234
- So tell me about it.
- Fuck it.

476
00:34:21,276 --> 00:34:24,571
Fuck nothing.
Time like this, you need to talk.

477
00:34:25,029 --> 00:34:26,781
A shoulder, an ear.

478
00:34:27,282 --> 00:34:29,367
Get it off your chest, man.

479
00:34:31,744 --> 00:34:33,204
Speaking in front of a group.

480
00:34:33,288 --> 00:34:35,832
Excellent, in fact, we'll do a list.

481
00:34:37,667 --> 00:34:40,420
Do you know what I find fascinating,
an muinteoir?

482
00:34:40,503 --> 00:34:43,548
- Dreams.
- We'll be doing dreams in a couple of weeks.

483
00:34:43,631 --> 00:34:47,802
- Fabulous. Will we?
- We will. So, public speaking.

484
00:34:48,469 --> 00:34:50,972
How does that make us feel? Anyone?

485
00:34:51,347 --> 00:34:53,183
- Vulnerable?
- Good.

486
00:34:54,309 --> 00:34:56,686
- Shy.
- Exposed.

487
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:58,271
Scared.

488
00:35:01,107 --> 00:35:04,736
- Powerful.
- No, it's just negative things now.

489
00:35:05,278 --> 00:35:06,446
Naked.

490
00:35:07,697 --> 00:35:10,617
Do you ever dream you're naked,
an muinteoir?

491
00:35:11,117 --> 00:35:13,745
It's fascinating. Do you ever do that?

492
00:35:14,996 --> 00:35:17,916
- Okay, what else?
- In command.

493
00:35:18,166 --> 00:35:20,126
Negative things. Come on, now.

494
00:35:21,085 --> 00:35:23,254
- Weak.
- Weak. Excellent.

495
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:26,216
Or you're relieving yourself
on O'Connell Street.

496
00:35:26,299 --> 00:35:28,426
What does that mean, an muinteoir?

497
00:35:28,468 --> 00:35:32,055
Number twos, like,
in a little toilet outside the GPO...

498
00:35:32,222 --> 00:35:36,184
and you're afraid to wipe your bum
because everybody will look at you.

499
00:35:36,309 --> 00:35:38,353
It's fascinating and laugh, like.

500
00:35:38,478 --> 00:35:42,232
- Okay, so. What's that, Maurice?
- Dreams, an muinteoir.

501
00:35:42,774 --> 00:35:47,487
We're not talking about dreams, you fool.
Did you not hear him?

502
00:35:47,862 --> 00:35:50,990
A couple of weeks' time, he said.
Can you not wait?

503
00:35:51,324 --> 00:35:53,827
You stupid old fool, what are you?

504
00:35:54,661 --> 00:35:56,287
What are you? A fool!

505
00:35:58,832 --> 00:36:00,750
- What do you want?
- Give us a ten.

506
00:36:00,875 --> 00:36:04,254
Don't do tens anymore.
Don't break it up that small anymore.

507
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:17,392
Fuck.

508
00:36:29,696 --> 00:36:30,697
Out of the way.

509
00:36:30,738 --> 00:36:33,533
Flatfoot, fat fucking faggot.

510
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:36,744
Go on, you prick. Prolong the inevitable.

511
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:40,373
See that? Even in your, what are they?
What have you got?

512
00:36:40,415 --> 00:36:43,042
Even in your Nikes, I'm more nimble.

513
00:36:44,961 --> 00:36:47,755
Me in my heavy brogans. What have we got?

514
00:36:51,009 --> 00:36:53,636
We've got money. Quit your wriggling!

515
00:36:56,055 --> 00:36:57,557
We've got gear.

516
00:37:01,311 --> 00:37:02,562
There you are.

517
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,869
Where the fuck is the motor?

518
00:37:23,249 --> 00:37:26,127
For fuck's sake. Some fuck's after...

519
00:37:26,211 --> 00:37:29,088
Shut the fuck up! You giggling whore, you.

520
00:37:30,006 --> 00:37:31,799
When will he be back?

521
00:37:32,842 --> 00:37:35,637
No, I can't wait that long!

522
00:37:37,305 --> 00:37:39,974
This is bollocks, man, I'm telling you.

523
00:37:40,433 --> 00:37:44,979
My rank, I should not have to deal with
this kind of unprofessional and...

524
00:37:47,065 --> 00:37:48,316
Fuck it.

525
00:37:52,195 --> 00:37:55,156
Give me the number of a taxi firm, will you?

526
00:37:56,991 --> 00:38:01,621
That's not what we want, Ben.
It's indigestible. It's too hard.

527
00:38:01,746 --> 00:38:03,873
- But it's real, it's true.
- I know that.

528
00:38:03,957 --> 00:38:05,375
It's out there.

529
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:07,836
I'm talking about a world
people don't see, Thomas.

530
00:38:07,877 --> 00:38:11,923
- The humanity within...
- But that's not what I hired you to do.

531
00:38:12,048 --> 00:38:14,300
Now, you wanna use a copper?

532
00:38:14,384 --> 00:38:17,887
Find some fella
who helps the homeless in his spare time.

533
00:38:17,971 --> 00:38:21,182
- Or one who can juggle.
- He likes Celtic mysticism.

534
00:38:21,224 --> 00:38:25,103
Yeah? Raithneach, Clannad,
artistes like that?

535
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:29,440
- Fainne Lasta?
- All that shit, yeah.

536
00:38:31,317 --> 00:38:34,946
But how's that a quirk, Ben?
Sounds like the guy knows his music.

537
00:38:35,029 --> 00:38:38,575
But him knowing his music
is a far from good enough reason to do him.

538
00:38:38,658 --> 00:38:42,078
He's too hard and he's too nasty. Nasty.

539
00:38:42,328 --> 00:38:43,872
- Too nasty.
- But...

540
00:38:43,955 --> 00:38:45,206
Softer.

541
00:38:53,214 --> 00:38:56,342
Jerry. What's this I hear
you're gonna be on telly?

542
00:38:56,426 --> 00:39:00,346
The truth and nothing but, man.
Not in a supporting role, either.

543
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:03,892
- The subject, I'm gonna be.
- Jammy fuck, you.

544
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,476
Leading man.

545
00:39:13,943 --> 00:39:17,155
- Has nobody any balls these days?
- That's what I said.

546
00:39:17,238 --> 00:39:19,115
- Yeah?
- To his face.

547
00:39:19,782 --> 00:39:22,869
- I agree with you 100%, Jerry.
- The faggot.

548
00:39:23,786 --> 00:39:25,997
Is he a faggot? Bet you he is.

549
00:39:26,873 --> 00:39:30,126
One of those fucks that tries
too hard to be one of the ladies.

550
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:31,544
I read you.

551
00:39:32,462 --> 00:39:34,672
Well, fair play to you.

552
00:39:35,298 --> 00:39:40,220
Talking to your boss like that, I respect that.
You work your way up, that's what I say.

553
00:39:40,303 --> 00:39:44,140
Develop your own show.
Call it Hard As Nails Cunts or something.

554
00:39:44,224 --> 00:39:46,142
Then we'll collaborate.

555
00:39:47,185 --> 00:39:49,687
Yellow-bellied fucks.

556
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:53,107
Listen, buddy, crime calls.

557
00:39:53,816 --> 00:39:57,278
- I'll catch you again, all right?
- Catch you, man.

558
00:40:01,533 --> 00:40:03,493
Motherfuckers.

559
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:17,549
You think people enjoy
that kind of attitude? Because they don't.

560
00:40:17,632 --> 00:40:19,676
Go on, do it again
if it makes you feel so good.

561
00:40:19,759 --> 00:40:21,219
Bloody state of you. What I should do now...

562
00:40:21,261 --> 00:40:22,428
is speak to your manager
and have you fired...

563
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:25,598
if I could only be bothered.
Don't know how well off you are.

564
00:40:25,682 --> 00:40:29,435
Go on, do it. You know you want to.

565
00:40:30,937 --> 00:40:33,189
I've changed my fucking mind!

566
00:40:36,025 --> 00:40:38,194
There's a couple of jars
smashed in that lane.

567
00:40:38,236 --> 00:40:39,112
Clear them up, will you?

568
00:40:39,195 --> 00:40:41,322
It's not my job, it's Thomas'.
He's on the brush.

569
00:40:41,447 --> 00:40:44,367
Your job is to do what I tell you.
Now come on.

570
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:46,536
It's not Dolce Salsa, is it?

571
00:40:46,619 --> 00:40:49,372
- It is, yeah.
- Can't do. Dolce Salsa makes me sick.

572
00:40:49,414 --> 00:40:52,208
- All I have to do is smell the stuff.
- Move.

573
00:40:52,292 --> 00:40:54,043
Thomas, wait there.

574
00:40:55,962 --> 00:40:59,549
There you are. Do it.

575
00:41:00,133 --> 00:41:01,509
Okay, man.

576
00:41:04,929 --> 00:41:08,016
You're okay, Thomas.
I'm just trying to make a point.

577
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,185
For God's sake!

578
00:41:16,316 --> 00:41:17,567
Told you.

579
00:41:18,359 --> 00:41:19,652
You finished?

580
00:41:30,038 --> 00:41:31,831
- You finished?
- Yeah.

581
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,001
Come with me.

582
00:41:37,754 --> 00:41:41,549
Thomas, clear up that sick
before someone slips in it.

583
00:41:45,386 --> 00:41:49,891
I want you to get one thing straight.
I'm your boss, you do as I say.

584
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:53,978
Go home, repeat it, maybe it'll lodge.

585
00:41:54,187 --> 00:41:57,315
One more incident like this,
do you hear me? One more incident...

586
00:41:57,398 --> 00:42:02,111
and I will TCB, as they say in the States.

587
00:42:03,404 --> 00:42:06,574
I will "take care of business".

588
00:42:07,575 --> 00:42:11,162
You are here to do as you are told.
You are here to work.

589
00:42:11,704 --> 00:42:14,749
So get back out there and do some.

590
00:42:17,126 --> 00:42:21,297
Come on, Thomas, move it.
If you move it, you won't have to smell it.

591
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:27,345
- I know that you've been patient, Karen.
- Stop.

592
00:42:27,428 --> 00:42:31,224
No, you have. Taking me shopping
and everything, the classes.

593
00:42:36,479 --> 00:42:39,440
Maybe it's a different kind of boost
you need.

594
00:42:39,607 --> 00:42:42,902
Something to remind yourself
you're attractive, say.

595
00:42:43,736 --> 00:42:46,156
Maybe you need to be chatted up
or something.

596
00:42:46,197 --> 00:42:50,160
- Flirted with, pursued...
- Wanted, Karen.

597
00:42:51,077 --> 00:42:54,080
- That's what it is.
- Okay, then.

598
00:42:55,665 --> 00:42:58,168
Let's do something about that.

599
00:42:59,085 --> 00:43:01,337
- Here's one, Ben.
- What is it?

600
00:43:01,796 --> 00:43:02,797
It's good.

601
00:43:02,839 --> 00:43:05,967
Like all the other good stuff
I've read so far?

602
00:43:06,176 --> 00:43:09,262
I'm getting a bit tired
of your attitude, Ben.

603
00:43:09,387 --> 00:43:13,099
You can't choose one, that's fine.
I've chosen one for you.

604
00:43:13,183 --> 00:43:14,267
Read it...

605
00:43:14,350 --> 00:43:16,769
get the lads, and get on it.

606
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:19,564
But it's not up for discussion, Ben.

607
00:43:37,415 --> 00:43:38,583
Hello?

608
00:43:45,632 --> 00:43:47,634
They want us to go on...

609
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:52,430
They want us to go on telly.
Because of the accident, the bus.

610
00:43:52,514 --> 00:43:55,225
Some man just rang.
They wanna do an interview.

611
00:43:55,308 --> 00:43:58,603
Said to ring him back if we're interested,
you know.

612
00:44:02,023 --> 00:44:05,443
I'm telling you,
Jonesy said it's the best place to go.

613
00:44:05,568 --> 00:44:09,072
- Maybe not the best, but the easiest.
- If you're desperate.

614
00:44:09,155 --> 00:44:11,491
But I am, John. You know I am.

615
00:44:28,007 --> 00:44:29,968
Jesus Christ.

616
00:44:35,598 --> 00:44:38,643
See, if this is all the competition there is...

617
00:44:38,977 --> 00:44:41,104
And some old ones are cute.

618
00:44:42,647 --> 00:44:45,191
- Not too old.
- Where?

619
00:44:46,276 --> 00:44:49,737
This is what Jonesy said.
You gotta scout about a bit.

620
00:44:56,661 --> 00:44:58,663
I'll meet you in a while.

621
00:45:04,502 --> 00:45:06,254
Pint of Guinness, please.

622
00:45:22,187 --> 00:45:24,022
You dirty bastard.

623
00:45:24,981 --> 00:45:28,693
Fancy a bit of mature, yeah?
Look, I know why you're here.

624
00:45:34,407 --> 00:45:37,994
I've got my own business, you know?
Fish and chip shop.

625
00:45:38,953 --> 00:45:41,289
- You like fish?
- Some fish.

626
00:45:42,248 --> 00:45:44,751
- Not fish-and-chip fish.
- Right.

627
00:45:46,169 --> 00:45:50,048
- You like chips, though?
- You know what I like? Onion rings.

628
00:45:51,549 --> 00:45:52,759
Right.

629
00:45:54,135 --> 00:45:56,638
Not the biggest fan of them myself.

630
00:45:57,222 --> 00:46:01,059
It's about the only part of my produce
that I'm not partial to.

631
00:46:01,392 --> 00:46:04,729
Look, I'm not gonna
beat around the bush, ladies.

632
00:46:05,522 --> 00:46:08,608
But if we can't be
compatible about business...

633
00:46:17,909 --> 00:46:19,869
- Now, him I like.
- Who?

634
00:46:20,912 --> 00:46:23,748
- That young guy?
- There's two of them.

635
00:46:23,873 --> 00:46:26,751
If he asks me to dance,
will you get up with his friend?

636
00:46:26,835 --> 00:46:29,254
Come on. I'd feel silly on my own.

637
00:46:29,671 --> 00:46:33,466
I mean, feck it, a woman my age...

638
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:37,470
place like this, what's the point in lying?

639
00:46:37,637 --> 00:46:40,306
That's my philosophy. The truth.

640
00:46:40,765 --> 00:46:44,394
Life's too short. What was I saying?

641
00:46:46,104 --> 00:46:50,066
The hormones, right.
No, it's not the worst thing...

642
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:54,404
because since I've been on them,
I have to say...

643
00:46:54,487 --> 00:46:57,949
I've been feeling very erotic.

644
00:46:59,117 --> 00:47:02,162
You know what
a younger man like yourself lacks?

645
00:47:02,871 --> 00:47:04,789
A bit of mature loving.

646
00:47:05,290 --> 00:47:09,419
You lack it because you don't look for it.

647
00:47:10,336 --> 00:47:12,589
But let me tell you something.

648
00:47:12,672 --> 00:47:15,800
I'm sporty.

649
00:47:19,846 --> 00:47:23,808
I'm actually...
Celia, you're talking about honesty?

650
00:47:24,184 --> 00:47:27,187
I'm actually just waiting on a mate. Sorry.

651
00:47:28,605 --> 00:47:29,731
Okay.

652
00:47:31,024 --> 00:47:33,985
I won't waste any more of your time.

653
00:47:42,035 --> 00:47:44,537
- I found one.
- Yeah, what's she like?

654
00:47:44,621 --> 00:47:48,666
- Will you dance with her mate? She's nice.
- What's her mate like?

655
00:47:54,506 --> 00:47:57,258
- Which? The right or the left?
- The left.

656
00:47:58,092 --> 00:48:00,178
- All right.
- The left's mine.

657
00:48:05,266 --> 00:48:07,060
All right, fuck it.

658
00:48:11,231 --> 00:48:14,108
- I hope you know, I've no interest.
- Me, neither.

659
00:48:14,192 --> 00:48:15,902
So nothing's gonna happen.

660
00:48:15,985 --> 00:48:20,698
We're just gonna dance, enjoy it,
and we're going to finish when they finish.

661
00:48:23,409 --> 00:48:25,036
- What's that perfume?
- Hey.

662
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:26,704
- I was just...
- Hey.

663
00:48:34,963 --> 00:48:36,756
You come here often?

664
00:48:38,591 --> 00:48:39,717
Yes?

665
00:48:41,010 --> 00:48:42,095
No?

666
00:48:44,222 --> 00:48:45,974
It's my first time.

667
00:48:47,016 --> 00:48:50,728
I didn't know it'd be, you know...

668
00:48:50,770 --> 00:48:52,272
Older people?

669
00:48:53,106 --> 00:48:56,609
- That's okay.
- Older than me, say.

670
00:49:05,743 --> 00:49:07,912
Are you a little shy, Oscar?

671
00:49:10,623 --> 00:49:12,250
I think you are.

672
00:49:14,711 --> 00:49:16,963
I think you're very nice, too.

673
00:49:22,427 --> 00:49:24,929
Would you like to come home with me?

674
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:30,476
I know, I can't believe I said it, either.

675
00:49:34,147 --> 00:49:35,648
But would you?

676
00:49:48,703 --> 00:49:50,121
Blue Enigma.

677
00:49:51,498 --> 00:49:52,832
My perfume.

678
00:49:56,586 --> 00:49:58,004
You said...

679
00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:03,343
You said you were waiting on a friend.
How dare you?

680
00:50:03,426 --> 00:50:08,014
- If you don't want me, you tell me the truth.
- Who's this?

681
00:50:08,139 --> 00:50:09,599
I'm coming here...

682
00:50:09,682 --> 00:50:12,185
- Who the hell are you?
- Nice dancing with you.

683
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:16,272
How dare you? I'm coming here
long enough not to need these lies.

684
00:50:16,356 --> 00:50:18,983
I'm finished. I'm going to the toilet.

685
00:50:19,984 --> 00:50:21,528
Did you hear what I said earlier on?

686
00:50:21,611 --> 00:50:24,447
I'm coming here long enough
not to need these lies.

687
00:50:24,531 --> 00:50:28,076
Do you hear what I'm saying? You big liar!

688
00:50:28,159 --> 00:50:30,745
Oscar, I'm splitting. Do you hear me?

689
00:50:30,829 --> 00:50:33,706
- Will you be all right?
- Who'd have you anyway, you pug-ugly?

690
00:50:33,748 --> 00:50:35,041
Fuck you.

691
00:50:35,208 --> 00:50:36,668
Fucking liar.

692
00:50:42,382 --> 00:50:45,301
So what do you wanna do?
Do you wanna go out?

693
00:50:45,635 --> 00:50:47,303
Wouldn't mind staying in.

694
00:50:47,387 --> 00:50:49,305
- Again?
- Why not?

695
00:50:50,265 --> 00:50:51,850
I'm gonna take a bath.

696
00:50:52,308 --> 00:50:55,520
- Can I help?
- You can bring me in a glass of wine.

697
00:51:13,413 --> 00:51:14,539
Hello?

698
00:51:14,956 --> 00:51:17,458
- Can I speak to Deirdre, please?
- Who's calling?

699
00:51:17,584 --> 00:51:18,918
It's John.

700
00:51:20,628 --> 00:51:23,131
- John she used to go out with?
- Yeah.

701
00:51:24,132 --> 00:51:27,218
- I'm sorry, I can't put you on to her.
- Why not?

702
00:51:27,302 --> 00:51:30,013
You're the competition, aren't you?
You're the ex.

703
00:51:30,096 --> 00:51:33,099
- Sam, who is it?
- It's for me, Deirdre.

704
00:51:35,351 --> 00:51:37,437
What is it you want, anyway?

705
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:40,106
You wanna win her back?
She's not going back.

706
00:51:40,190 --> 00:51:43,943
- So what's the problem?
- The problem is it'd make me uncomfortable.

707
00:51:44,068 --> 00:51:45,862
I'm sure you're not the worst, okay?

708
00:51:45,945 --> 00:51:48,406
But as far as Deirdre's concerned,
you're my enemy.

709
00:51:48,448 --> 00:51:50,867
- Pal, you don't want me as your enemy.
- No?

710
00:51:50,909 --> 00:51:53,745
I can make life hard, man. That's right.

711
00:51:53,828 --> 00:51:57,415
Talk to me like you're talking,
I'll crack your baldy head, man.

712
00:51:57,499 --> 00:52:00,543
And I know you're baldy.
I'll be the worst enemy...

713
00:52:09,844 --> 00:52:12,388
You ever fucking had! Do you hear me?

714
00:52:25,443 --> 00:52:28,238
All right, John boy?
Sorry for your troubles, man.

715
00:52:28,279 --> 00:52:30,490
What? A pint of Guinness, please, Seamus.

716
00:52:30,573 --> 00:52:33,535
Heard about your break-up.
This is Lehiff, by the way.

717
00:52:33,618 --> 00:52:35,578
Come here,
why don't you join us over here?

718
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:38,248
- We got some business...
- A proposition.

719
00:52:38,331 --> 00:52:40,917
We got a proposition we wanna run by you.

720
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,546
- Potential of a few quid, man.
- Many a quid's potential.

721
00:52:46,047 --> 00:52:47,590
Follow us over.

722
00:53:09,779 --> 00:53:12,699
I need a bit of a lift at the moment, Oscar.

723
00:53:13,158 --> 00:53:14,909
Bit of a pepping up.

724
00:53:16,578 --> 00:53:18,246
Can you pep me up?

725
00:53:29,174 --> 00:53:31,134
Good Jesus.

726
00:53:31,426 --> 00:53:33,720
Look. Rough, man.

727
00:53:33,803 --> 00:53:36,389
Bit of pain-slash-pleasure, you know?

728
00:53:36,723 --> 00:53:41,227
Jesus, my cock's killing me,
my bones, my muscles...

729
00:53:41,686 --> 00:53:43,188
but I'm energized.

730
00:53:43,229 --> 00:53:46,483
- Good, because I've a proposition for you.
- A what?

731
00:53:46,524 --> 00:53:49,110
Some business.
Come on, I'll tell you on the floor.

732
00:53:50,528 --> 00:53:52,989
- It's my cock, John.
- Yeah, so you said.

733
00:53:53,989 --> 00:54:03,989
