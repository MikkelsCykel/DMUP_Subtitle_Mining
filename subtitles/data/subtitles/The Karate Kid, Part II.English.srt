1
00:01:15,087 --> 00:01:17,167
Wouldn't a flyswatter be easier?

2
00:01:18,127 --> 00:01:21,167
Man who catch fly with chopstick...

3
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:23,087
accomplish anything.

4
00:01:24,766 --> 00:01:26,527
You ever catch one?

5
00:01:26,607 --> 00:01:28,167
Not yet.

6
00:01:51,686 --> 00:01:54,246
What was that you were doing
on those stumps over there?

7
00:01:54,327 --> 00:01:57,406
- Called "crane technique."
- Does it work?

8
00:01:57,487 --> 00:02:00,286
If do right, no can defense.

9
00:02:00,326 --> 00:02:01,846
Could you teach me?

10
00:02:01,927 --> 00:02:05,246
First learn stand,
then learn fly.

11
00:02:05,327 --> 00:02:07,726
Nature rule, Daniel-san.
Not mine.

12
00:02:07,807 --> 00:02:10,886
- Where'd you learn it from?
- Father teach.

13
00:02:10,926 --> 00:02:13,726
- You must have had some father.
- Oh, yes.

14
00:02:25,766 --> 00:02:27,286
"Valor."

15
00:03:03,206 --> 00:03:05,445
Johnny, leave him alone!
He's had enough!

16
00:03:05,526 --> 00:03:09,005
- I'll decide when he's had enough!
- What is wrong with you?

17
00:03:09,086 --> 00:03:10,925
- An enemy deserves no mercy!
- Right!

18
00:03:11,006 --> 00:03:12,526
- No mercy!
- Right!

19
00:03:12,605 --> 00:03:13,606
You're crazy!

20
00:03:18,605 --> 00:03:20,965
Tommy, Bobby, get him!

21
00:03:30,885 --> 00:03:33,045
Mercy is for the weak.

22
00:03:33,126 --> 00:03:35,925
Here, on the street,
in competition...

23
00:03:36,006 --> 00:03:37,965
a man confronts you,
he is the enemy.

24
00:03:38,046 --> 00:03:41,645
An enemy deserves no mercy.
What is the problem, Mr. Lawrence?

25
00:03:44,405 --> 00:03:47,205
Come on, let's forget this.

26
00:03:47,245 --> 00:03:49,645
Wait. Not yet.

27
00:03:49,726 --> 00:03:51,205
Time out.

28
00:03:51,285 --> 00:03:53,165
Go to your sensei.
Turn. Kneel.

29
00:03:54,085 --> 00:03:56,365
Johnny, you're a cream puff!.

30
00:03:57,485 --> 00:03:58,885
Sweep the leg.

31
00:04:01,005 --> 00:04:03,205
You have a problem with that?

32
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:06,525
No, Sensei.

33
00:04:08,325 --> 00:04:09,925
No mercy.

34
00:04:26,005 --> 00:04:28,964
It's over,Johnny!
You did it!

35
00:04:32,004 --> 00:04:34,285
LaRusso, you okay?
Can you go on?

36
00:04:34,324 --> 00:04:36,004
Get him a body bag!

37
00:04:37,325 --> 00:04:39,564
- All right, feet.
- Do it again!

38
00:04:39,645 --> 00:04:42,604
That's a warning for
illegal contact to the knee.

39
00:04:42,684 --> 00:04:44,685
Finish it!
No mercy!

40
00:04:44,764 --> 00:04:47,325
No mercy!
Way to finish,Johnny!

41
00:04:47,404 --> 00:04:48,604
Finish him!

42
00:04:57,444 --> 00:04:58,364
Winner!

43
00:05:13,084 --> 00:05:16,044
Hey, Mr. Miyagi,
you know, I was thinking.

44
00:05:16,084 --> 00:05:17,644
About what, Daniel-san?

45
00:05:17,724 --> 00:05:20,644
That maybe we should have
a strategy now, you know?

46
00:05:20,724 --> 00:05:22,084
For what?

47
00:05:22,164 --> 00:05:24,844
My future.
My whole tournament career.

48
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:26,844
Miyagi already have one.

49
00:05:28,164 --> 00:05:30,804
Really? What is it?

50
00:05:30,884 --> 00:05:32,284
Early retirement.

51
00:05:41,204 --> 00:05:43,124
Ali and mother
wait for us at restaurant.

52
00:05:43,204 --> 00:05:44,884
I know. I'm starving.

53
00:05:44,924 --> 00:05:46,844
- That was great.
- Thank you.

54
00:05:46,883 --> 00:05:50,723
LaRusso, very impressive win.
You showed a lot of poise.

55
00:05:50,764 --> 00:05:53,964
People are gonna be talking about that
last kick for years. Congratulations.

56
00:05:54,043 --> 00:05:56,363
Get out of my way!
Out of my way!

57
00:05:56,444 --> 00:05:59,243
- What you doin' to the brother?
- Don't play with me.

58
00:06:00,284 --> 00:06:01,684
Excuse me.

59
00:06:14,883 --> 00:06:16,243
Why does he act like that?

60
00:06:16,324 --> 00:06:19,644
That guy just doesn't know
what karate's all about.

61
00:06:19,683 --> 00:06:22,804
- Well, maybe he should learn.
- Would you like to teach him?

62
00:06:24,043 --> 00:06:26,123
- Good luck, Daniel.
- Thanks.

63
00:06:26,203 --> 00:06:27,563
- Take care.
- Thanks.

64
00:06:27,604 --> 00:06:29,883
Oy, keep ladies waiting.

65
00:06:31,923 --> 00:06:33,803
- Wait, wait!
- What?

66
00:06:33,843 --> 00:06:37,003
- Could we have your autograph?
- Yeah, man!

67
00:06:37,043 --> 00:06:39,243
- So, how you guys doin'?
- Great.

68
00:06:39,323 --> 00:06:41,324
Oh, yeah?
Where are you from?

69
00:06:41,403 --> 00:06:43,443
- Reseda.
- You're from Res--

70
00:06:43,523 --> 00:06:46,203
I'm from Reseda.
I moved there a couple months ago.

71
00:06:46,283 --> 00:06:48,443
- Maybe we'll see you sometime.
- Daniel-san.

72
00:06:48,523 --> 00:06:51,202
- What?
- Come. Getting late.

73
00:06:51,283 --> 00:06:53,683
It's the price of fame.
Gotta get used to it.

74
00:06:53,763 --> 00:06:56,282
Take it easy.
Maybe I'll see you.

75
00:06:56,323 --> 00:06:57,922
That's not fair.
I got second place.

76
00:06:58,003 --> 00:07:00,363
Second place is no place!
You're off the team!

77
00:07:00,443 --> 00:07:02,283
- I did my best.
- What did you say?

78
00:07:02,363 --> 00:07:05,123
- I did my best.
- You're nothin'! You're a loser!

79
00:07:05,202 --> 00:07:07,643
- No, you're the loser.
- I'm the loser, huh?

80
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:13,523
- Now who's the loser?
- You're really sick, man.

81
00:07:16,403 --> 00:07:18,763
- Hey, what are you doin'?
- Don't!

82
00:07:18,802 --> 00:07:21,203
How does second place
feel now, huh?

83
00:07:21,282 --> 00:07:23,322
- He can't breathe!
- Mind your business.

84
00:07:23,403 --> 00:07:25,402
- You're gonna kill him!
- Sensei, please.

85
00:07:25,483 --> 00:07:28,122
You're hurting him.
He's sorry. He really is.

86
00:07:30,162 --> 00:07:32,282
- Let him go.
- Mr. Miyagi's right.

87
00:07:32,362 --> 00:07:33,762
Let him go!

88
00:07:33,803 --> 00:07:35,763
I said, let him go!

89
00:07:35,842 --> 00:07:38,042
Beat it, slope, or you're next.

90
00:08:13,602 --> 00:08:15,561
Mercy is for the weak.

91
00:08:15,642 --> 00:08:18,682
We do not train
to be merciful here.

92
00:08:18,762 --> 00:08:21,762
A man face you, he is enemy.

93
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:25,522
Enemy deserve no mercy.

94
00:08:38,921 --> 00:08:41,442
Daniel-san,
ladies no wait forever.

95
00:08:41,481 --> 00:08:43,802
You could've killed him,
couldn't you?

96
00:08:43,841 --> 00:08:46,122
- Oy.
- Why didn't you then?

97
00:08:46,201 --> 00:08:50,121
Because, Daniel-san, for person
with no forgiveness in heart...

98
00:08:50,161 --> 00:08:53,122
Iiving even worse punishment
than death.

99
00:09:47,561 --> 00:09:50,521
Oh, Daniel-san,
must have been some senior prom.

100
00:09:50,601 --> 00:09:52,881
- What happened?
- You mean, what didn't happen.

101
00:09:52,921 --> 00:09:55,560
First I let Ali borrow the car,
and she redesigns my fender.

102
00:09:55,641 --> 00:09:59,120
I don't know what she did to the engine,
but that ain't runnin' right either.

103
00:09:59,201 --> 00:10:01,521
And you know what else she does?

104
00:10:01,561 --> 00:10:05,401
Tells me that she's just fallen in love
with some football player from UCLA.

105
00:10:05,481 --> 00:10:07,441
- Why didn't she just lie?
- Things could be worse.

106
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,440
Don't worry about it.
They are.

107
00:10:09,521 --> 00:10:12,921
Last night I find out my mom
got picked by a company to go to Fresno.

108
00:10:12,961 --> 00:10:17,201
Two months. We leave tomorrow afternoon.
I gotta spend my whole summer in Fresno.

109
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,400
You're not gonna
be able to fix that.

110
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,480
How'd you do that?

111
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,080
What'd you do?

112
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,161
- Come. Miyagi tell you later.
- Where we goin'?

113
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,080
I have just the thing
make you feel better.

114
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:39,200
- Probably got work for me to do.
- Hit nail on head.

115
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,880
How come every time I have a problem,
you have work for me?

116
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:45,560
- Cosmic coincidence.
- When'd you build this?

117
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,520
Daniel-san, watch.

118
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,760
Come. Take off jacket.
You try.

119
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,640
Must focus.

120
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:12,960
Concentrate.

121
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:15,640
Focus. Most important.

122
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,080
- I can't, Mr. Miyagi, not today.
- Why?

123
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:23,960
Because my whole life
is goin' out of focus, that's why.

124
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,720
When you feel life out of focus...

125
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:29,919
always return to basic oflife.

126
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:32,559
What, praying?

127
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,039
Breathing.

128
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,359
No breathe, no life.

129
00:11:51,999 --> 00:11:54,040
Oy. Come try it.

130
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,920
Out of mouth.
Breathe in through nose.

131
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,919
Breathe out of mouth.

132
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,799
Breathe in.

133
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,919
Breathe out.

134
00:12:23,199 --> 00:12:25,679
Oy. Now how feel?

135
00:12:28,119 --> 00:12:30,079
Better. More focused.

136
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:33,119
Good. Come back to work.

137
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:49,918
- Hey, I did it.
- You focused, Daniel-san.

138
00:12:49,999 --> 00:12:53,399
Remember:
Breathe in, breathe out.

139
00:12:54,199 --> 00:12:55,958
In...

140
00:12:55,999 --> 00:12:57,399
out.

141
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,278
Very good work.

142
00:13:28,598 --> 00:13:30,798
Yeah. I'll be right there.

143
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:33,838
- How feel?
- Much better, thanks.

144
00:13:33,918 --> 00:13:35,878
What am I building
out there, any way?

145
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:37,438
Guest room.

146
00:13:37,518 --> 00:13:40,798
- You expecting company?
- Ah, refugee.

147
00:13:42,118 --> 00:13:45,918
Refugee? Oh, yeah?
That's great. From where?

148
00:13:46,878 --> 00:13:48,358
Fresno.

149
00:13:55,597 --> 00:13:57,118
Fresno?

150
00:13:57,158 --> 00:13:59,557
Miyagi talk to mother
last night too.

151
00:13:59,598 --> 00:14:02,597
- And she said I could stay here?
- lflike.

152
00:14:02,678 --> 00:14:05,438
- I don't have to go to Fresno?
- If no want.

153
00:14:05,518 --> 00:14:07,878
Oh, man, you saved my life!

154
00:14:07,957 --> 00:14:10,837
Thanks!
Mr. Miyagi, thanks.

155
00:14:12,037 --> 00:14:13,877
Welcome.

156
00:14:13,957 --> 00:14:15,477
Oy. Iced tea.

157
00:14:15,517 --> 00:14:17,478
Oh, yeah.
Wait. Look.

158
00:14:17,557 --> 00:14:21,117
I made this for you. It's rosewood.
I thought it'd be nice to show 'em off.

159
00:14:22,237 --> 00:14:25,158
Daniel-san, thank you for gift...

160
00:14:25,237 --> 00:14:27,238
but why show off?

161
00:14:28,478 --> 00:14:31,117
It says something about you,
winnin' the Medal of Honor.

162
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:33,678
It says you're brave.
I thought it'd be neat.

163
00:14:34,757 --> 00:14:37,077
This say you brave.

164
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:40,037
This say you lucky.

165
00:14:41,997 --> 00:14:44,837
- Oh, Mr. Miyagi live here?
- Excuse me.

166
00:14:44,877 --> 00:14:46,517
- " Miyagi."
- Excuse me.

167
00:14:46,598 --> 00:14:49,878
Mr. Miyagi. Registered letter
for you, sir, from Okinawa.

168
00:14:49,957 --> 00:14:51,797
Okinawa?

169
00:14:51,837 --> 00:14:54,677
Yes, sir.
Would you sign here, please?

170
00:14:55,957 --> 00:14:57,997
This is some place you have here.

171
00:14:58,077 --> 00:15:00,957
From the outside yard,
you'd never know it.

172
00:15:01,037 --> 00:15:03,677
You should charge admission.

173
00:15:03,757 --> 00:15:06,277
My missus loves this stuff.

174
00:15:06,356 --> 00:15:08,877
You mind ifl bring her by
sometime to see it?

175
00:15:10,597 --> 00:15:12,437
Some other time, maybe.

176
00:15:26,917 --> 00:15:28,557
What is it?

177
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:32,836
My father.

178
00:15:33,877 --> 00:15:36,396
He very sick.

179
00:15:38,476 --> 00:15:41,837
Your father? I didn't even
know he was still alive.

180
00:15:52,596 --> 00:15:55,236
How come you can get
a passport in one day?

181
00:15:55,316 --> 00:15:57,276
Have next-day plane ticket.

182
00:15:58,676 --> 00:16:01,796
You never told me, why'd you leave
Okinawa in the first place?

183
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:05,196
Fall in love with girl.

184
00:16:05,276 --> 00:16:08,076
So? Why'd you leave?

185
00:16:08,156 --> 00:16:11,756
Was arranged by her parents
she marry someone else.

186
00:16:14,076 --> 00:16:16,836
- Did you ever meet the guy?
- Hai.

187
00:16:16,876 --> 00:16:19,076
What was he like?

188
00:16:19,156 --> 00:16:21,756
Was Miyagi best friend.

189
00:16:27,596 --> 00:16:30,756
So this is your old girlfriend, Yukie?
She sent the letter?

190
00:16:30,836 --> 00:16:33,356
- Hai.
- And this is your buddy.

191
00:16:34,275 --> 00:16:37,236
My best buddy, Sato.

192
00:16:37,316 --> 00:16:40,676
- You think he's still alive?
- We were same age.

193
00:16:41,676 --> 00:16:43,596
What did he do when
he found out about you two?

194
00:16:44,876 --> 00:16:47,436
Challenge Miyagi to fight.

195
00:16:48,396 --> 00:16:50,796
Must've been some girl.

196
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:53,116
Oh, Miyagi remember.

197
00:16:53,156 --> 00:16:55,916
I make big speech...

198
00:16:55,995 --> 00:16:58,035
in front of whole village.

199
00:16:58,116 --> 00:17:00,436
Miyagi breakwith tradition...

200
00:17:00,475 --> 00:17:03,075
go against parent arrangement.

201
00:17:04,355 --> 00:17:06,716
Marry yukie anyway.

202
00:17:12,076 --> 00:17:15,676
Of course, Sato feel disgrace.

203
00:17:17,075 --> 00:17:20,876
So challenge Miyagi to fight
to save his honor.

204
00:17:22,276 --> 00:17:25,515
- And you lost?
- No.

205
00:17:25,595 --> 00:17:27,476
Never fight.

206
00:17:27,515 --> 00:17:30,315
Next day leave Okinawa forever.

207
00:17:33,315 --> 00:17:35,195
What about her?
Didn't you love her?

208
00:17:35,235 --> 00:17:36,915
Very much.

209
00:17:36,995 --> 00:17:39,355
- Well, did she love you?
- Hai.

210
00:17:39,435 --> 00:17:43,195
- So, then how could you leave?
- Miyagi no believe in fighting.

211
00:17:43,275 --> 00:17:46,715
I know that,
but you guys were in love. Come on.

212
00:17:49,035 --> 00:17:51,915
Never put passion before principle.

213
00:17:51,995 --> 00:17:54,635
Even if win, you lose.

214
00:18:00,675 --> 00:18:02,035
Think they got married?

215
00:18:02,115 --> 00:18:05,315
Sato, his family
was richest in village.

216
00:18:05,395 --> 00:18:08,715
Yukie's was poorest.
Was good arrangement.

217
00:18:10,275 --> 00:18:13,994
It was 45 years ago. He shouldn't
be angry about his honor anymore.

218
00:18:15,835 --> 00:18:19,354
In Okinawa,
honor have no time limit.

219
00:18:21,554 --> 00:18:23,395
You serious?

220
00:18:24,434 --> 00:18:28,434
In Okinawa, honor very serious.

221
00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:48,754
I guess I'd better get goin'.
I gotta go help my mom pack.

222
00:18:48,834 --> 00:18:51,034
I'll stop by tomorrow,
okay, Mr. Miyagi?

223
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:54,554
Taxi leave 6:00 p.m.

224
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:57,034
Yeah, I'll be here by then.

225
00:19:00,034 --> 00:19:03,874
Miyagi sorry things not work out.

226
00:19:03,954 --> 00:19:06,794
That's no problem.
I hope your dad's okay.

227
00:19:58,594 --> 00:20:01,074
You're cutting it
pretty close, mister.

228
00:20:09,273 --> 00:20:11,473
- Go airport.
- All right.

229
00:20:17,393 --> 00:20:19,793
Have a good flight.
Nice to see you.

230
00:20:20,793 --> 00:20:22,193
- Hello.
- Good evening.

231
00:20:23,633 --> 00:20:27,113
You will be in seat 32-B.

232
00:20:27,193 --> 00:20:29,513
- Enjoy the flight.
- Mr. Miyagi!

233
00:20:29,593 --> 00:20:32,273
Wait! I'm comin' with you!
My mother said it's okay.

234
00:20:32,353 --> 00:20:36,153
- I mean, if it's okay with you.
- Very expensive ticket.

235
00:20:36,233 --> 00:20:38,953
I got the money from my savings account.
It's all taken care of.

236
00:20:39,033 --> 00:20:41,673
Savings for college education.

237
00:20:41,753 --> 00:20:44,513
So I'll get a job when we get back
and I'll go six months late.

238
00:20:44,553 --> 00:20:46,673
It doesn't make a difference
when I go.

239
00:20:46,753 --> 00:20:49,873
-Jobs very hard to find.
- Yeah, I know.

240
00:20:49,952 --> 00:20:53,873
I mean, Mr. Miyagi,
you're more important than college.

241
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:56,353
You're more important
than anything to me.

242
00:20:56,433 --> 00:20:58,833
When I need you,
you're always there for me.

243
00:20:58,913 --> 00:21:02,673
I really wanna go, and if it's
okay with you, I'd like to go.

244
00:21:04,033 --> 00:21:05,913
Daniel-san,
don't think good idea.

245
00:21:05,953 --> 00:21:08,472
It'll give me a chance
to study Okinawan history up close.

246
00:21:08,553 --> 00:21:11,632
- Come on.
- Never know you study that.

247
00:21:11,713 --> 00:21:13,152
I just started.

248
00:21:13,233 --> 00:21:16,953
- I'm closing the doors.
- Come on.

249
00:21:17,032 --> 00:21:19,712
- Please?
- Go back to the gate, young man.

250
00:21:22,312 --> 00:21:24,992
Young man coming with us.

251
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:27,992
Mr. Miyagi, thank you.

252
00:21:28,072 --> 00:21:31,152
No, Daniel-san.
Thank you.

253
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:36,872
- Hope you don't get airsick.
- What's airsick?

254
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:47,912
You know the biggest U.S. air base
in the Pacific is on Okinawa?

255
00:21:51,792 --> 00:21:54,512
What's the name
of your village again?

256
00:21:54,552 --> 00:21:56,272
Tomi Village.

257
00:21:58,032 --> 00:21:59,592
I can't find it.

258
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:03,232
Find Naha?

259
00:22:03,312 --> 00:22:05,552
Yeah, I know where Naha is.

260
00:22:05,592 --> 00:22:08,472
Go south, along the sea.

261
00:22:08,472 --> 00:22:10,751
Find Tomi Village.

262
00:22:10,832 --> 00:22:12,872
I keep runnin' into the air base.

263
00:22:15,472 --> 00:22:18,792
You look again morning.
MaybeTomi Village be there.

264
00:22:18,872 --> 00:22:20,552
Get some sleep.

265
00:22:53,951 --> 00:22:56,431
Was Sato as good as you in karate?

266
00:22:57,632 --> 00:22:59,511
Have same teacher.

267
00:23:01,111 --> 00:23:03,311
Your father?
He taught both of you?

268
00:23:05,032 --> 00:23:08,751
I thought you said your family's karate
was only taught from father to son.

269
00:23:10,031 --> 00:23:11,911
Miyagi ask father...

270
00:23:11,951 --> 00:23:14,391
make exception this case.

271
00:23:22,111 --> 00:23:25,231
If you fought Sato, you think
your father would have been referee?

272
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:29,391
No referee.

273
00:23:31,991 --> 00:23:33,870
How do you know who wins?

274
00:23:35,311 --> 00:23:38,431
The one who dead doesn't.

275
00:24:14,711 --> 00:24:17,190
It's pretty weird having somebody
go through my stuff like that.

276
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:19,470
Glad I didn't have
any dirty laundry.

277
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:23,590
Was this place here
when you left?

278
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:26,310
Miyagi leave Okinawa by boat.

279
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:29,470
No airport Okinawa at that time.

280
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:32,110
I kept lookin' through my book.
I still can't find your village.

281
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:35,350
- How are we gonna find it?
- Ask taxi.

282
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:39,310
Hey, Mr. Miyagi, isn't that him?

283
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:44,230
Can you break a log like that?

284
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:48,630
Don't know.
Never been attacked by tree.

285
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:06,830
It is great honor.
I am Chozen Toguchi.

286
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:09,830
Yukie-san say sorry
she could not meet you herself.

287
00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:11,870
We have a car waiting for you.

288
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:14,269
Car?

289
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:17,390
Please.

290
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:22,509
You speakvery good English,
Toguchi-san.

291
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:25,149
In Okinawa, it help to speak
very good English.

292
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:28,789
Myfriend and student,
Daniel LaRusso.

293
00:25:28,869 --> 00:25:30,229
Thank you.

294
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:33,430
-You karate student, huh?
- Yeah.

295
00:25:33,509 --> 00:25:35,750
- Welcome to Okinawa.
- Thanks.

296
00:25:35,829 --> 00:25:38,949
I hope your stay here
is a pleasant one.

297
00:26:15,269 --> 00:26:17,789
How you know I be here today?

298
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:21,348
Okinawa very small place.

299
00:26:31,429 --> 00:26:32,789
Village south.

300
00:26:32,829 --> 00:26:36,109
Why, please, we go north now?

301
00:26:36,188 --> 00:26:38,788
Some things have changed
since you go, Miyagi-san.

302
00:26:38,869 --> 00:26:41,029
And some things have not, eh?

303
00:27:02,908 --> 00:27:04,428
Out!

304
00:27:16,428 --> 00:27:18,388
- What's goin' on?
- No talking!

305
00:27:25,028 --> 00:27:26,348
Uncle.

306
00:27:27,388 --> 00:27:28,468
Uncle!

307
00:27:44,867 --> 00:27:46,268
Sato.

308
00:27:49,068 --> 00:27:51,067
So, coward...

309
00:27:51,148 --> 00:27:52,987
you return.

310
00:27:53,868 --> 00:27:56,468
To settle affairs with Father.

311
00:27:56,547 --> 00:27:59,147
And with me.

312
00:28:00,028 --> 00:28:02,668
Sato, I no fight you.

313
00:28:04,588 --> 00:28:08,548
Then you die as you have lived:
a coward!

314
00:28:14,107 --> 00:28:16,668
You see your father.

315
00:28:16,747 --> 00:28:18,387
Then you see me!

316
00:28:45,187 --> 00:28:47,747
- What are you gonna do?
- Find taxi.

317
00:28:47,827 --> 00:28:49,827
No. About Sato.

318
00:28:49,907 --> 00:28:52,066
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

319
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:53,467
Nothing.

320
00:29:03,186 --> 00:29:06,387
All this because you had to go and tell
everybody you were gonna marry yukie?

321
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:11,067
Why didn't you just marry her
and move to Alaska?

322
00:29:11,146 --> 00:29:13,787
Daniel-san, nobody perfect.

323
00:29:29,227 --> 00:29:31,866
- Where you goin', buddy?
- Tomi Village.

324
00:29:31,947 --> 00:29:34,186
Tomi Village?
Never heard of it.

325
00:29:34,226 --> 00:29:36,266
This is Kadena Air Base.

326
00:29:36,347 --> 00:29:38,226
Sarge, Tomi Village?

327
00:29:38,306 --> 00:29:41,626
You're standing on it, Corporal!
Get 'em outta here!

328
00:29:41,707 --> 00:29:43,546
Just take that road
and make a right.

329
00:29:49,066 --> 00:29:53,506
Miyagi remember first time
father teach fishing...

330
00:29:53,586 --> 00:29:56,066
right off this point.

331
00:29:56,146 --> 00:29:58,706
Was 1 927.

332
00:30:00,106 --> 00:30:02,426
Was much quieter then.

333
00:30:34,026 --> 00:30:35,625
Thanks a lot.

334
00:30:50,146 --> 00:30:52,026
Take off shoes.

335
00:31:06,746 --> 00:31:08,825
Auntie Yukie said you would come.

336
00:31:08,865 --> 00:31:11,425
Yukie-- Where is she?

337
00:31:12,825 --> 00:31:14,865
Nursing yourfather.

338
00:31:17,145 --> 00:31:20,265
- I'm Daniel.
- I am Kumiko.

339
00:31:20,305 --> 00:31:22,145
- Please.
- Thank you.

340
00:32:20,024 --> 00:32:21,905
He sleeping.

341
00:32:30,385 --> 00:32:33,384
How you know where to find me?

342
00:32:37,024 --> 00:32:39,144
Have known for many years.

343
00:32:41,264 --> 00:32:43,824
Why you never write sooner?

344
00:32:45,624 --> 00:32:47,704
Out of respect.

345
00:32:50,424 --> 00:32:52,264
For husband.

346
00:32:53,904 --> 00:32:56,024
For your silence.

347
00:32:58,384 --> 00:33:00,824
I never marry.

348
00:33:21,504 --> 00:33:23,344
What did he say?

349
00:33:24,783 --> 00:33:28,424
" If I am dreaming,
let me never awake.

350
00:33:29,583 --> 00:33:33,383
Ifl am awake,
let me never sleep."

351
00:34:21,863 --> 00:34:23,423
Good morning.

352
00:34:25,423 --> 00:34:27,103
You're Yukie.

353
00:34:27,183 --> 00:34:29,703
- You Daniel-san.
- Yes.

354
00:34:29,783 --> 00:34:31,623
Mr. Miyagi's told me
a lot about you.

355
00:34:32,743 --> 00:34:35,863
And he tell me lot about you.

356
00:34:35,942 --> 00:34:39,023
- There's not that much to tell.
- Oh, no, no.

357
00:34:39,063 --> 00:34:41,743
He very...

358
00:34:41,783 --> 00:34:43,423
proud of you.

359
00:34:46,382 --> 00:34:48,623
How's his father feeling?

360
00:34:49,822 --> 00:34:52,223
Very tired.

361
00:34:54,023 --> 00:34:56,063
Miyagi Sensei in dojo.

362
00:34:57,382 --> 00:35:00,143
Thank you.
See you later.

363
00:35:22,263 --> 00:35:24,102
Oh, good morning, Daniel-san.

364
00:35:24,183 --> 00:35:25,703
Good morning.

365
00:35:25,782 --> 00:35:28,583
Welcome to Miyagi family dojo.
You like?

366
00:35:28,662 --> 00:35:30,622
It's great.

367
00:35:30,702 --> 00:35:32,902
This is really somethin'.
Who are all these guys?

368
00:35:32,942 --> 00:35:34,542
All Miyagi ancestor.

369
00:35:34,622 --> 00:35:37,622
Four hundred year worth.

370
00:35:37,662 --> 00:35:39,582
And who's that?

371
00:35:39,662 --> 00:35:42,942
That is Miyagi Shimpo Sensei.

372
00:35:42,982 --> 00:35:46,102
First Miyagi
bring karate to Okinawa.

373
00:35:46,142 --> 00:35:49,782
- The one who went to China.
- Hai. 1 625.

374
00:35:49,822 --> 00:35:52,942
- How did he get there? By boat?
- By accident.

375
00:35:52,982 --> 00:35:56,861
Like all Miyagi,
Shimpo Sensei was fisherman.

376
00:35:56,942 --> 00:35:58,342
Love fishing.

377
00:35:58,381 --> 00:36:00,021
Love saki.

378
00:36:00,102 --> 00:36:03,702
One day, strong wind, strong sun...

379
00:36:03,782 --> 00:36:07,262
strong saki, but no fish.

380
00:36:07,342 --> 00:36:11,102
Shimpo Sensei fall asleep
off coast ofOkinawa...

381
00:36:11,141 --> 00:36:13,782
wake up off coast ofChina.

382
00:36:13,861 --> 00:36:18,301
Ten year later, he come back
with Chinese wife and two kids...

383
00:36:18,381 --> 00:36:20,741
and secret...

384
00:36:20,781 --> 00:36:23,101
of Miyagi family karate.

385
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:27,301
This is the secret
of your family's karate?

386
00:36:28,782 --> 00:36:31,542
- I don't get it.
- Practice. You will.

387
00:36:31,581 --> 00:36:33,462
Come. We go work.

388
00:36:34,301 --> 00:36:36,462
What are these things?

389
00:36:36,541 --> 00:36:39,021
These rules to karate.

390
00:36:39,101 --> 00:36:43,701
Rule number one:
" Karate for defense only."

391
00:36:46,622 --> 00:36:48,542
Rule number two:

392
00:36:48,621 --> 00:36:51,261
" First learn rule number one."

393
00:37:11,501 --> 00:37:13,021
Yeah, coming.

394
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:23,021
This looks like a town
that time forgot.

395
00:37:27,341 --> 00:37:31,981
I thinkwe went school together.
I'd introduce you, but I forget name.

396
00:37:34,021 --> 00:37:36,740
How come if this is a fishing village,
I don't see anybody fishing?

397
00:37:36,781 --> 00:37:38,660
Yukie-san tell me...

398
00:37:38,741 --> 00:37:42,981
after war, Sato father
bring in commercial fishing boat.

399
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:47,860
Inside two year, all fish gone.
All small boat gone.

400
00:37:47,901 --> 00:37:53,141
Almost everything gone,
except old cannery...

401
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:55,780
and lots of memories.

402
00:37:55,861 --> 00:37:57,740
Ah, lchiro.

403
00:37:57,821 --> 00:37:59,940
When I left, he was same place...

404
00:37:59,981 --> 00:38:04,220
doing same thing,
playing same tune.

405
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:13,260
- That's a shrine, right?
- Hai. Shinto shrine.

406
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:17,500
It must be tough times
with all the fish gone, huh?

407
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:19,580
Very tough.

408
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:23,220
Most people leavevillage for city,
look for work.

409
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:26,580
My father, some others,
invent whole new economy.

410
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:29,980
Go into vegetable business,
save what was left ofvillage.

411
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:31,900
Everyone owns
their own little farm?

412
00:38:31,979 --> 00:38:34,859
No. Sato own. Village rent.

413
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:36,820
- That's a bummer.
- You're right.

414
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,340
Familiar face.

415
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:42,860
After school, Kumiko teach
O-bon dance to kids.

416
00:38:56,299 --> 00:39:00,900
O-bon dance. It's for the festival
in honor of the dead, right?

417
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,299
Very good!

418
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:04,740
I remember reading about it last night.

419
00:39:04,779 --> 00:39:08,739
What is that, a pillbox?
Probably left over from World War ll.

420
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:12,940
It must have been terrible here.
1 5,000 Americans killed in ten days.

421
00:39:13,019 --> 00:39:17,379
Yeah. And 1 50,000 Okinawan
and Japanese.

422
00:39:17,459 --> 00:39:20,339
Why we all so stupid?

423
00:39:52,059 --> 00:39:54,138
You have seen Father?

424
00:39:55,579 --> 00:39:57,699
Then we finish tonight.

425
00:39:59,218 --> 00:40:01,698
I bring a nephew for witness.

426
00:40:01,739 --> 00:40:06,179
Then you and nephew both
lose sleep tonight. I not be there.

427
00:40:06,259 --> 00:40:08,099
Your teacher coward!

428
00:40:11,939 --> 00:40:13,939
You leave me no choice.

429
00:40:27,058 --> 00:40:28,659
Wait a second.

430
00:40:34,338 --> 00:40:35,659
Your father.

431
00:40:35,738 --> 00:40:38,299
He want you.

432
00:40:39,219 --> 00:40:41,179
And you, too.

433
00:41:38,898 --> 00:41:42,578
Out of respect for my teacher...

434
00:41:42,657 --> 00:41:45,817
I give you three days to mourn.

435
00:41:49,497 --> 00:41:54,017
When finish, I come back.

436
00:41:54,098 --> 00:41:57,497
You prepare to join him.

437
00:44:16,736 --> 00:44:20,896
You know,
when my father died...

438
00:44:20,976 --> 00:44:24,935
I spent a lot of time
thinking I wasn't such a great son.

439
00:44:27,016 --> 00:44:30,415
Like maybe
I could have listened more...

440
00:44:31,935 --> 00:44:34,856
spent more time
with him together.

441
00:44:38,416 --> 00:44:40,695
I felt so guilty...

442
00:44:40,735 --> 00:44:45,375
Iike he did everything for me
and I didn't do anything for him.

443
00:44:53,855 --> 00:44:58,855
Then one day I realized, I did the
greatest thing for him before he died.

444
00:45:01,295 --> 00:45:04,095
I was there with him...

445
00:45:04,135 --> 00:45:06,775
and I held his hand...

446
00:45:06,815 --> 00:45:08,895
and I said good-bye.

447
00:45:59,014 --> 00:46:02,135
Very good, Daniel-san.
Time for next lesson.

448
00:46:03,294 --> 00:46:04,695
All right!

449
00:46:08,934 --> 00:46:10,814
I don't get something.

450
00:46:10,854 --> 00:46:14,894
If Sato hates you so much,
why does he give you time to mourn?

451
00:46:14,974 --> 00:46:16,814
My father was his teacher.

452
00:46:16,894 --> 00:46:19,574
Inside the heart,
Sato still know right from wrong.

453
00:46:19,654 --> 00:46:21,494
He still wants to kill you.

454
00:46:21,574 --> 00:46:23,534
Sometime what heart know,
head forget.

455
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:25,894
But the guy's looking to go to war.
I don't understand.

456
00:46:25,974 --> 00:46:28,334
Never stop war
by taking part in one.

457
00:46:28,414 --> 00:46:30,854
I know. But what if he threw that punch?
What would you have done?

458
00:46:30,935 --> 00:46:33,894
- Block.
- Think you could have?

459
00:46:33,974 --> 00:46:36,894
- Even you could have.
- I'm not that strong.

460
00:46:36,974 --> 00:46:40,614
Not matter who's stronger.
Matter who's smarter.

461
00:46:42,334 --> 00:46:44,854
I guess that's why
I won the tournament.

462
00:46:44,933 --> 00:46:46,814
Good guess, Daniel-san.

463
00:46:51,694 --> 00:46:56,094
From very first karate lesson,
Miyagi father always say...

464
00:46:56,174 --> 00:46:59,254
" Best way to avoid punch,
no be there."

465
00:46:59,333 --> 00:47:03,774
- I don't get it.
- Miyagi say same until I work here.

466
00:47:03,854 --> 00:47:07,333
Miyagi first job,
work for Sato father.

467
00:47:10,173 --> 00:47:15,174
One day, Miyagi mind on something
other than fish when empty net return.

468
00:47:20,014 --> 00:47:21,814
That was close!

469
00:47:21,893 --> 00:47:24,853
Drum technique. Understand?

470
00:47:24,934 --> 00:47:26,054
Yeah!

471
00:47:26,133 --> 00:47:27,933
Drum technique.

472
00:47:28,013 --> 00:47:30,054
Let me try.

473
00:47:31,453 --> 00:47:33,373
Come on.Just one turn, please.

474
00:47:33,413 --> 00:47:36,373
You gotta.Just one turn.

475
00:47:39,374 --> 00:47:41,373
Please?

476
00:47:41,453 --> 00:47:43,413
Okay, come platform.

477
00:47:43,494 --> 00:47:46,533
- Great.
- I go pull up hook.

478
00:47:50,133 --> 00:47:54,733
Father say use drum technique
only as last resort.

479
00:47:54,773 --> 00:47:56,333
You ready?

480
00:47:56,413 --> 00:47:57,693
I'm ready.

481
00:47:59,853 --> 00:48:03,453
Remember, best block, no be there.

482
00:48:03,533 --> 00:48:04,533
One...

483
00:48:04,613 --> 00:48:05,533
two...

484
00:48:05,613 --> 00:48:06,613
three!

485
00:48:12,013 --> 00:48:13,692
You all right?

486
00:48:13,773 --> 00:48:15,653
Yeah, I'm okay.

487
00:48:15,693 --> 00:48:19,653
Come. Enough for today.
Try again tomorrow.

488
00:48:27,012 --> 00:48:31,932
You know, Miyagi and Yukie
have first date here.

489
00:48:32,013 --> 00:48:35,453
Remember like was yesterday.

490
00:48:36,653 --> 00:48:39,652
Happen over load of fresh mackerel.

491
00:48:53,812 --> 00:48:55,613
You all right?

492
00:48:55,652 --> 00:48:58,612
Yeah. I'm sorry.
That was pretty stupid.

493
00:49:03,492 --> 00:49:06,613
Miyagi say that to father
when same thing happened.

494
00:49:06,692 --> 00:49:10,173
Father agree it was stupid.
Father was right.

495
00:49:11,052 --> 00:49:13,412
Is there a counterpunch
in the technique?

496
00:49:16,452 --> 00:49:17,852
Ask drum.

497
00:49:34,772 --> 00:49:37,612
Come, Daniel-san,
talk to drum later.

498
00:49:51,172 --> 00:49:54,332
- Does that guy's uncle own everything?
- Almost.

499
00:49:54,412 --> 00:49:57,651
Hey! There's Miyagi the coward.

500
00:49:57,732 --> 00:49:59,532
And his baby!

501
00:49:59,611 --> 00:50:02,532
- Doesn't that bother you?
- Why should it?

502
00:50:02,611 --> 00:50:05,012
People might believe it's true.

503
00:50:05,091 --> 00:50:09,692
Daniel-san, lie become truth
only if person want to believe it.

504
00:50:10,892 --> 00:50:13,211
Is that another
old Okinawan saying?

505
00:50:13,252 --> 00:50:15,651
No. New Okinawan saying.

506
00:50:15,732 --> 00:50:17,331
How new?

507
00:50:18,371 --> 00:50:20,252
About ten seconds.

508
00:50:25,371 --> 00:50:26,811
Are you okay?

509
00:50:26,891 --> 00:50:29,491
I'll get it for you.

510
00:50:29,571 --> 00:50:30,971
Carrots, right?

511
00:50:38,931 --> 00:50:40,171
I'll get it.

512
00:50:52,691 --> 00:50:55,331
Your little teacher
should get hearing aid.

513
00:50:55,411 --> 00:50:58,811
- Maybe you need one, too.
- I only hear what's worth listening to.

514
00:51:00,091 --> 00:51:03,051
Look out! We're working here.

515
00:51:03,131 --> 00:51:04,971
What is this?

516
00:51:08,811 --> 00:51:10,811
So, you cheat people!

517
00:51:10,890 --> 00:51:13,691
Shame! You cheat! You cheat!

518
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:16,571
We'll talk sometime
when you're not so busy.

519
00:51:25,490 --> 00:51:28,770
You still remember our song?

520
00:51:30,370 --> 00:51:32,330
Sing for me.

521
00:51:33,850 --> 00:51:36,690
Yukie, I no sing long time.

522
00:51:36,771 --> 00:51:39,450
Please. Please.

523
00:51:51,850 --> 00:51:55,451
Oh, we were so young then.

524
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:59,730
Yukie, why you never marry?

525
00:51:59,770 --> 00:52:01,930
You never come back.

526
00:52:02,930 --> 00:52:05,170
You knew I would not.

527
00:52:06,370 --> 00:52:08,570
Yes, I knew.

528
00:52:11,490 --> 00:52:14,170
My father...

529
00:52:14,250 --> 00:52:19,770
he ever tell you about
how he feel when I leave?

530
00:52:22,850 --> 00:52:24,250
One time.

531
00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:31,490
He say he love you very much...

532
00:52:31,569 --> 00:52:33,209
and...

533
00:52:35,450 --> 00:52:38,009
what you did was right.

534
00:52:43,889 --> 00:52:46,249
Except for one thing.

535
00:52:49,809 --> 00:52:52,569
I should have taken you with me.

536
00:53:22,690 --> 00:53:23,729
Hello.

537
00:53:25,929 --> 00:53:28,849
- I am disturbing you?
- What? No, not at all.

538
00:53:28,929 --> 00:53:30,809
What are you doing?

539
00:53:30,889 --> 00:53:34,169
- I was practicing some moves. See?
- What are moves?

540
00:53:34,249 --> 00:53:38,329
It's like karate.
I'm trying to figure this thing out.

541
00:53:38,409 --> 00:53:40,249
Looks like O-bon dance.

542
00:53:40,289 --> 00:53:42,849
Then I must be doing
something wrong.

543
00:53:43,889 --> 00:53:45,969
Doing something right. Look.

544
00:54:06,529 --> 00:54:09,488
- Wow. Where'd you learn that?
- From my auntie.

545
00:54:09,569 --> 00:54:11,049
That's terrific.

546
00:54:11,929 --> 00:54:13,888
You try.

547
00:54:13,969 --> 00:54:17,048
No, not me. I was absent
the day they taught graceful.

548
00:54:17,129 --> 00:54:19,088
You were what?

549
00:54:19,169 --> 00:54:21,208
Forget it, it's a bad joke.

550
00:54:21,288 --> 00:54:22,769
I'll try it.

551
00:54:22,848 --> 00:54:24,249
Good.

552
00:54:31,168 --> 00:54:32,728
Wait a sec.

553
00:54:35,848 --> 00:54:36,768
Right...

554
00:54:36,848 --> 00:54:38,848
and left.

555
00:54:55,568 --> 00:54:57,088
We're a hit.

556
00:54:58,608 --> 00:55:01,288
Maybe we could
take it on the road.

557
00:55:01,327 --> 00:55:04,448
But we are on the road.

558
00:55:04,528 --> 00:55:06,848
You dance very nice.

559
00:55:06,888 --> 00:55:09,208
Like geisha.

560
00:55:09,248 --> 00:55:10,768
Let's go.

561
00:55:10,848 --> 00:55:14,248
His little teacher's favorite
technique, huh? " Let's go."

562
00:55:15,768 --> 00:55:17,888
Hey, come on, give me
the drum back, please.

563
00:55:17,968 --> 00:55:19,808
You mean the baby rattle?

564
00:55:19,888 --> 00:55:22,568
Why don't baby come take it back?

565
00:55:24,448 --> 00:55:25,848
Stop!

566
00:55:27,247 --> 00:55:29,767
Are you okay?

567
00:55:29,847 --> 00:55:33,727
You insult my honor again...

568
00:55:33,808 --> 00:55:35,487
and I kill you.

569
00:55:53,408 --> 00:55:55,247
You keep for your collection.

570
00:55:55,328 --> 00:55:58,047
I know you like it.

571
00:56:05,167 --> 00:56:07,047
Are you all right?

572
00:56:07,127 --> 00:56:09,447
Yeah, I'm okay.

573
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:20,927
He cheats these people, and I'm
insulting his honor. I don't get it.

574
00:56:21,006 --> 00:56:22,847
He has no idea what honor is.

575
00:56:22,926 --> 00:56:25,487
I kinda got that feeling.

576
00:56:25,567 --> 00:56:29,287
Ever since we were children,
he has always been the same.

577
00:56:29,367 --> 00:56:33,167
This is the first time I had somebody
ever tell me they're gonna kill me.

578
00:56:33,247 --> 00:56:35,686
This is ridiculous.
I gotta talk to him.

579
00:56:35,767 --> 00:56:39,887
He would only take it as a sign
of weakness and try to hurt you again.

580
00:56:39,966 --> 00:56:41,847
You got any ideas?

581
00:56:42,846 --> 00:56:44,247
Avoid him.

582
00:56:45,967 --> 00:56:48,087
I think I'm on the wrong island.

583
00:56:52,164 --> 00:56:54,004
What's going on here?

584
00:56:54,044 --> 00:56:55,883
Tea ceremony.

585
00:56:55,924 --> 00:56:58,524
I guess it's an old ritual.

586
00:57:02,444 --> 00:57:05,724
It means that they
are falling in love again.

587
00:57:47,963 --> 00:57:51,243
- Daniel-san!
- I've been looking for you.

588
00:57:51,323 --> 00:57:53,643
Been here trying
to fix refrigerator.

589
00:57:53,683 --> 00:57:55,804
What's wrong with it?

590
00:57:56,283 --> 00:57:59,563
This. Gotta go Naha City
for new part.

591
00:58:00,523 --> 00:58:02,003
You like come?

592
00:58:02,083 --> 00:58:05,483
I was supposed to go sightseeing
with Kumiko, but I could go.

593
00:58:05,523 --> 00:58:07,923
- You go, have good time.
- We could go tomorrow.

594
00:58:08,003 --> 00:58:10,843
- No, I see you later.
- We don't have plans.

595
00:58:10,883 --> 00:58:13,723
Never keep lady waiting.

596
00:58:15,403 --> 00:58:18,203
I'll remember that.
I'll see you later.

597
00:58:18,283 --> 00:58:20,883
Hi. Sorry to keep you waiting.

598
00:58:38,882 --> 00:58:40,323
Be careful.

599
00:58:42,722 --> 00:58:44,763
This reminds me of the Palisades.

600
00:58:44,842 --> 00:58:46,722
Palisades? Where's that?

601
00:58:46,803 --> 00:58:49,882
It's in New Jersey,
where I used to live.

602
00:58:49,922 --> 00:58:52,202
Is it pretty?

603
00:58:52,242 --> 00:58:54,242
Some of it.

604
00:58:55,682 --> 00:58:59,362
There it is! The ruins
of the castle of King Shohashi.

605
00:58:59,443 --> 00:59:01,083
The Peace King.

606
00:59:01,122 --> 00:59:03,882
- You know King Shohashi?
- Not personally.

607
00:59:04,962 --> 00:59:07,202
Name of it is--

608
00:59:07,282 --> 00:59:09,002
Now Sato owns it.

609
00:59:09,082 --> 00:59:12,682
In old days, O-bon dance
was held here, but no more.

610
00:59:12,762 --> 00:59:15,162
Now every piece goes away.

611
00:59:15,202 --> 00:59:19,242
Sato, he sells it to museums.

612
00:59:19,242 --> 00:59:21,122
Sounds like him.

613
00:59:22,522 --> 00:59:26,362
Legend is, if you race up to the castle
and win, your wish will come true.

614
00:59:26,442 --> 00:59:28,962
Yeah? I'll give you a head start.

615
00:59:29,042 --> 00:59:31,122
Not necessary, thank you.

616
00:59:31,202 --> 00:59:33,002
Excuse me.

617
00:59:33,082 --> 00:59:35,002
Ready, set, go!

618
00:59:51,762 --> 00:59:53,602
- I won!
- You cheated!

619
00:59:53,682 --> 00:59:55,602
And you know you did.

620
00:59:57,842 --> 01:00:00,442
We'll share the wish.

621
01:00:00,482 --> 01:00:02,321
Close your eyes.

622
01:00:17,281 --> 01:00:21,961
Know what I wanna know? What do you
wanna do with your life, your dreams?

623
01:00:22,041 --> 01:00:24,241
Okay, I'll show you my dream.

624
01:00:24,322 --> 01:00:27,601
I still can't get used to people driving
on the wrong side of the street.

625
01:00:27,681 --> 01:00:30,642
- What side do you drive on?
- On the right side.

626
01:00:30,721 --> 01:00:34,161
- I didn't know that.
- Everybody drives on the right side.

627
01:00:34,201 --> 01:00:37,001
- Not everybody.
- That's what I'm learning.

628
01:00:43,281 --> 01:00:46,241
You want to sell TVs for a living?

629
01:00:46,281 --> 01:00:50,041
What? Interested in electronics?
I don't understand.

630
01:00:50,921 --> 01:00:52,841
There.

631
01:00:52,881 --> 01:00:55,481
That is my dream.

632
01:00:55,561 --> 01:00:58,561
- You want to be a dancer!
- Very much.

633
01:00:58,601 --> 01:01:01,321
That's a great thing to be.

634
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:03,361
Where do you study?

635
01:01:04,401 --> 01:01:07,281
No schools for this kind of dancing
in Okinawa.

636
01:01:07,361 --> 01:01:08,841
What a drag!

637
01:01:09,881 --> 01:01:13,320
Come to the dance tonight.
Oh, bring your friend.

638
01:01:13,401 --> 01:01:15,680
- Okay.
- Good. See you there.

639
01:01:15,761 --> 01:01:20,040
- Like to go to dance?
- Sure. That's Sato's dojo.

640
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,160
I want to check that out.
Come on.

641
01:01:25,241 --> 01:01:27,521
Not inside.
Chozen teaches in there.

642
01:01:27,561 --> 01:01:32,800
I'm not going inside. I just wanna look
through the window. He won't see me.

643
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:35,560
He teach American military police
in there.

644
01:01:35,641 --> 01:01:37,001
Really?

645
01:01:49,521 --> 01:01:51,240
He's not bad.

646
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:53,361
He is Sato's number-one student.

647
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:54,960
I can see why.

648
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:57,160
We must go.
He may see you.

649
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:08,280
Maybe we'll run into
Mr. Miyagi here.

650
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:10,280
Oh? Why would he be here?

651
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:13,840
He said he had to come into town
to get a part for his refrigerator.

652
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:16,960
Oh! I know that store.
It's at the corner.

653
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:19,760
- Maybe we will see him.
- Good!

654
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:24,720
What's going on in here?

655
01:02:24,799 --> 01:02:27,560
This bad place.
We don't want to go in here.

656
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:30,279
Let's check it out.

657
01:02:49,799 --> 01:02:53,000
Come on, baby,
give me the money.

658
01:02:53,039 --> 01:02:55,559
I've got 45 here.
Come on, baby.

659
01:02:58,039 --> 01:03:01,039
Show me you can do it.
Show me you can do it.

660
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:03,440
Yeah! I got 40!

661
01:03:03,479 --> 01:03:05,360
The guy's standing wrong.

662
01:03:06,399 --> 01:03:08,959
-See? I told you. You must use your hip.
-But he looks so strong.

663
01:03:09,039 --> 01:03:12,279
No, you gotta be strong here, not here.
It doesn't make a difference.

664
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:15,679
You think you can do better,
big mouth?

665
01:03:15,759 --> 01:03:17,639
You think you can do better?

666
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:20,559
- I don't know.
- Let's find out, huh?

667
01:03:20,639 --> 01:03:23,759
- Maybe some other time.
- There is no other time!

668
01:03:23,839 --> 01:03:27,839
Whatever problems Mr. Miyagi has with
your uncle, they don't have to be ours.

669
01:03:27,919 --> 01:03:31,079
No. We have our own, huh?

670
01:03:32,079 --> 01:03:35,319
- Kumiko, where are you going?
- You go nowhere!

671
01:03:35,399 --> 01:03:37,999
Call my uncle.
You will take bets.

672
01:03:39,199 --> 01:03:41,839
Yosh! I give three to one, eh?

673
01:03:41,879 --> 01:03:45,519
No, no, I'm not doing it!

674
01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:50,079
You have a choice:
broken ice or broken neck.

675
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:52,239
He's got to break all three, right?

676
01:03:52,318 --> 01:03:55,559
Wrong! All six!

677
01:03:56,958 --> 01:03:59,239
All the bets in.

678
01:03:59,279 --> 01:04:02,559
Not all bets. Not yet.

679
01:04:03,998 --> 01:04:05,839
Boy, am I glad to see you!

680
01:04:05,918 --> 01:04:08,478
No worry, nothing.
Miyagi fix everything.

681
01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:09,919
What odds?

682
01:04:09,998 --> 01:04:12,519
Three to one he does not make
through ice.

683
01:04:12,598 --> 01:04:15,279
- How many pieces?
- Six.

684
01:04:15,358 --> 01:04:17,598
Come on, let's get out of here.

685
01:04:17,678 --> 01:04:21,199
$600 say he break all six.

686
01:04:21,238 --> 01:04:22,439
600 bucks?

687
01:04:23,478 --> 01:04:27,239
- I cannot cover that.
- You are covered.

688
01:04:30,558 --> 01:04:32,238
Now we have bet.

689
01:04:33,798 --> 01:04:35,638
All right! Give me your money.

690
01:04:35,718 --> 01:04:38,718
Hey, I can't believe this.

691
01:04:38,798 --> 01:04:41,078
I won't be able to break that.

692
01:04:41,118 --> 01:04:44,718
He tried twice and only got through two.
What do you expect me to do?

693
01:04:44,798 --> 01:04:46,118
Focus.

694
01:04:46,198 --> 01:04:47,958
Great, and what are you gonna do?

695
01:04:47,998 --> 01:04:49,558
Pray.

696
01:04:51,438 --> 01:04:53,958
You got it. All bets are in.

697
01:05:47,358 --> 01:05:50,317
We do not honor bet with coward.

698
01:05:50,397 --> 01:05:52,838
Do not embarrass uncle again.

699
01:06:01,078 --> 01:06:03,037
Thank you, Sato.

700
01:06:03,117 --> 01:06:05,677
Pleasure do business with you.

701
01:06:10,037 --> 01:06:13,477
You knew it all along, didn't you?
You didn't have a doubt in your mind.

702
01:06:13,517 --> 01:06:16,917
-No doubt.
-Howwill we spend it? What will we get?

703
01:06:16,997 --> 01:06:21,037
You get college tuition.
We get Chinese food. Come.

704
01:06:35,877 --> 01:06:39,236
I thought you have date.

705
01:06:39,317 --> 01:06:41,477
Yeah. I was waiting for Kumiko.

706
01:06:41,517 --> 01:06:44,036
I wish you had one of these back home.
This place is terrific.

707
01:06:45,317 --> 01:06:47,476
No use weapon for duster.

708
01:06:48,836 --> 01:06:50,397
This old rag?

709
01:06:50,476 --> 01:06:51,917
Drop old rag.

710
01:06:51,996 --> 01:06:53,997
- Why?
- Drop.

711
01:06:56,477 --> 01:06:58,797
- What I see?
- I don't--

712
01:07:00,916 --> 01:07:03,836
- Primary target.
- Primary target. A little close.

713
01:07:06,236 --> 01:07:08,356
This is foryou.
Dance clothes.

714
01:07:17,436 --> 01:07:19,596
Come on! We waiting foryou.

715
01:07:20,676 --> 01:07:25,476
My uncle say your
three days mourning over.

716
01:07:25,557 --> 01:07:27,836
I have been sent to get you.

717
01:07:28,717 --> 01:07:32,316
Tell uncle I am farmer,
not fighter.

718
01:08:00,996 --> 01:08:03,516
Sensei, a visitor to see you.

719
01:08:16,875 --> 01:08:19,996
Is that same wood
we find together on beach?

720
01:08:20,075 --> 01:08:22,436
Same. What you want?

721
01:08:23,795 --> 01:08:25,876
Come make peace between us.

722
01:08:25,916 --> 01:08:28,356
You forget. You betray me.

723
01:08:29,476 --> 01:08:31,555
I was only 1 8 years old.

724
01:08:31,636 --> 01:08:34,155
And responsible for own action.

725
01:08:34,235 --> 01:08:36,355
It explain why I leave.

726
01:08:36,435 --> 01:08:38,915
Fear is why you leave.

727
01:08:38,995 --> 01:08:41,875
Sato, I beg you.

728
01:08:41,956 --> 01:08:44,195
Your fear make air stink.

729
01:08:48,755 --> 01:08:51,395
What has happened to you?

730
01:09:24,354 --> 01:09:26,235
Isn't this great?

731
01:09:26,315 --> 01:09:28,155
Yeah, it's nice.

732
01:09:28,234 --> 01:09:31,315
Are you still worried about
what happened this afternoon?

733
01:09:31,394 --> 01:09:36,194
I came here to help Mr. Miyagi.
And all this stuff, I feel so helpless.

734
01:09:36,275 --> 01:09:37,954
Nothing you can do.

735
01:09:38,035 --> 01:09:39,395
I guess.

736
01:09:39,435 --> 01:09:41,315
Can you dance like this?

737
01:09:41,355 --> 01:09:42,835
I can try.

738
01:09:42,914 --> 01:09:45,195
- One, two, three, four. Got it?
- I think so.

739
01:10:35,034 --> 01:10:36,714
Hey, you're very good.

740
01:10:36,794 --> 01:10:40,154
You tease me.
You're a great dancer.

741
01:10:41,194 --> 01:10:44,794
Wanna get something to drink?
Sit down?

742
01:10:44,873 --> 01:10:46,834
Where did you learn
to dance like that?

743
01:10:46,914 --> 01:10:49,634
I've been my mom's practice partner
foryears.

744
01:10:49,714 --> 01:10:51,873
She must be a good teacher.

745
01:10:51,954 --> 01:10:53,953
Yeah, she's great.
Have a seat.

746
01:10:54,034 --> 01:10:57,113
- Okay, thanks.
- Oh, man.

747
01:10:58,794 --> 01:11:02,514
- You feeling better now?
- Much better, thanks.

748
01:11:02,593 --> 01:11:04,274
That's good.

749
01:11:07,113 --> 01:11:11,353
Hey, can I ask you something?

750
01:11:11,434 --> 01:11:13,313
Sure.

751
01:11:13,394 --> 01:11:15,034
It's, you know...

752
01:11:15,113 --> 01:11:18,953
it's kind of personal, though.

753
01:11:23,233 --> 01:11:25,314
Are you--

754
01:11:25,393 --> 01:11:28,594
Are you arranged like, you know?

755
01:11:28,673 --> 01:11:30,353
Arranged?

756
01:11:30,394 --> 01:11:33,113
To marry somebody?

757
01:11:34,113 --> 01:11:37,553
Oh! No. That's an old custom.

758
01:11:38,873 --> 01:11:40,873
Whoever I marry is up to me.

759
01:11:40,953 --> 01:11:42,953
Well, that's good.

760
01:11:44,153 --> 01:11:45,473
Are you arranged?

761
01:11:45,553 --> 01:11:48,473
What, are you kiddin'?
I'm a free agent.

762
01:11:49,473 --> 01:11:51,313
What is free agent?

763
01:11:51,392 --> 01:11:53,873
That just means that I'm available.

764
01:11:55,953 --> 01:11:57,313
That's good.

765
01:11:58,553 --> 01:11:59,912
Yeah.

766
01:12:08,073 --> 01:12:11,113
Oh, no, not again.
I'm not lookin' for any trouble.

767
01:12:11,193 --> 01:12:13,033
Maybe trouble looking foryou.

768
01:12:13,113 --> 01:12:14,872
What do you want from me?

769
01:12:14,953 --> 01:12:16,792
My money back.

770
01:12:24,793 --> 01:12:26,792
Come on, man,
that's all my money.

771
01:12:26,873 --> 01:12:29,152
No. All my money.

772
01:12:33,593 --> 01:12:38,153
Don't worry about your little friend.
We take her home.

773
01:12:51,632 --> 01:12:52,752
Thank you.

774
01:12:54,392 --> 01:12:55,832
Come on!

775
01:12:56,953 --> 01:12:59,512
Comin' through! Look out.

776
01:13:02,312 --> 01:13:03,673
Sorry.

777
01:13:04,712 --> 01:13:06,232
You got the keys?

778
01:13:50,672 --> 01:13:52,831
Miyagi, come out.

779
01:13:57,712 --> 01:13:59,711
We fight now!

780
01:14:34,151 --> 01:14:36,631
What are you guys doin' here?

781
01:14:36,711 --> 01:14:38,751
Where Miyagi?

782
01:14:38,831 --> 01:14:40,231
I don't know.

783
01:14:44,511 --> 01:14:47,151
Leave him message for me.

784
01:14:47,230 --> 01:14:48,951
With pleasure.

785
01:14:53,391 --> 01:14:56,590
Come here.
I want to show you something.

786
01:15:32,870 --> 01:15:36,871
Your sensei teach you
how to fight with spear?

787
01:15:42,950 --> 01:15:44,151
Too bad.

788
01:15:46,030 --> 01:15:48,790
Maybe he teach you
how to be coward.

789
01:15:48,870 --> 01:15:51,430
Hey, Mr. Coward.

790
01:16:02,790 --> 01:16:04,470
Leave message.

791
01:16:19,230 --> 01:16:21,310
This your teacher's fault.

792
01:16:21,390 --> 01:16:25,309
If he were man with honor,
you would live.

793
01:16:25,390 --> 01:16:27,389
But he's not.

794
01:16:41,669 --> 01:16:42,909
Enough!

795
01:16:44,429 --> 01:16:47,709
Uncle problem with Miyagi,
not with boy.

796
01:16:47,790 --> 01:16:51,910
No, you have problem, old man,
with me.

797
01:17:43,069 --> 01:17:44,629
Act of coward!

798
01:17:49,309 --> 01:17:51,068
Daniel-san, you okay?

799
01:17:51,109 --> 01:17:53,508
He was really gonna kill me.

800
01:17:55,909 --> 01:17:57,309
Come.

801
01:18:00,948 --> 01:18:04,189
Miyagi make tea.
Make you feel better.

802
01:18:04,268 --> 01:18:07,108
Tomorrow we go home.

803
01:18:47,908 --> 01:18:52,548
I did not want for us
to end this way again.

804
01:18:54,508 --> 01:18:57,068
I would stay if could.

805
01:18:58,308 --> 01:18:59,668
I know.

806
01:19:20,988 --> 01:19:25,788
Yukie, what can I do
to ease your pain?

807
01:19:33,707 --> 01:19:35,827
Take me with you.

808
01:19:59,267 --> 01:20:00,707
Whatcha doin'?

809
01:20:02,827 --> 01:20:04,427
Old custom.

810
01:20:05,787 --> 01:20:08,427
When fishermen
would go out to sea...

811
01:20:08,507 --> 01:20:12,306
families would offer
rice to the gods.

812
01:20:13,347 --> 01:20:15,547
For a good catch?

813
01:20:17,307 --> 01:20:19,467
For a quick return.

814
01:20:26,427 --> 01:20:28,707
Thought any more
about dance school?

815
01:20:30,067 --> 01:20:33,986
I told you.
No schools for that here.

816
01:20:34,067 --> 01:20:36,387
Well, there are in the States.

817
01:20:37,426 --> 01:20:39,387
My home is here.

818
01:20:42,307 --> 01:20:44,627
Home is where you hang your hat.

819
01:20:47,746 --> 01:20:50,306
You think I would like America?

820
01:20:50,387 --> 01:20:52,706
I think you would love it.

821
01:20:55,426 --> 01:20:58,026
Do you think it would love me?

822
01:21:00,266 --> 01:21:03,266
I know one part of it
that already does.

823
01:21:10,826 --> 01:21:12,866
- What's goin' on?
- Let's go see.

824
01:21:12,946 --> 01:21:14,786
Okay, come on.

825
01:21:42,226 --> 01:21:44,586
What are you doing?

826
01:21:44,666 --> 01:21:46,666
I sell land.

827
01:21:46,706 --> 01:21:48,026
Why?

828
01:21:48,106 --> 01:21:49,985
Why do you think?

829
01:21:50,026 --> 01:21:51,905
You will destroy village?

830
01:21:51,946 --> 01:21:54,426
No, you will!

831
01:22:05,745 --> 01:22:07,506
You win.

832
01:22:08,825 --> 01:22:10,786
I fight you.

833
01:22:13,025 --> 01:22:14,626
One condition.

834
01:22:14,705 --> 01:22:17,945
No matter whowin...

835
01:22:18,025 --> 01:22:21,705
title to land
pass tovillage forever.

836
01:22:21,785 --> 01:22:24,506
You ask fortoo much.

837
01:22:24,585 --> 01:22:27,946
Small price to pay
foryour honor.

838
01:22:29,825 --> 01:22:33,345
You're right. Small price.

839
01:22:33,426 --> 01:22:37,185
I see you here midnight.

840
01:22:45,225 --> 01:22:49,505
Miyagi, I wait long time forthis.

841
01:22:50,545 --> 01:22:52,065
No tricks tonight.

842
01:22:52,145 --> 01:22:56,065
Ortomorrow everything gone!

843
01:22:57,745 --> 01:23:00,905
Their homes, their church...

844
01:23:00,945 --> 01:23:03,385
everything gone!

845
01:23:19,225 --> 01:23:20,585
What's this?

846
01:23:20,664 --> 01:23:22,824
Last will and testament.

847
01:23:22,905 --> 01:23:28,304
Yukie get house here.
You get house and pickup back home.

848
01:23:28,385 --> 01:23:31,145
I don't want the house
and the pickup. I want you.

849
01:23:31,224 --> 01:23:33,345
Can't we call this off?
Why don't we just leave?

850
01:23:37,224 --> 01:23:39,584
Impossible, Daniel-san.

851
01:23:39,624 --> 01:23:42,464
Just forget about
the honor garbage.

852
01:23:43,544 --> 01:23:46,624
Have nothing to do
with honor garbage.

853
01:23:46,704 --> 01:23:49,464
This have to do
with village survival.

854
01:23:49,545 --> 01:23:53,144
This isn't three points and you're out.
If you lose, I know what happens.

855
01:23:54,984 --> 01:23:57,264
Miyagi already win.

856
01:23:57,344 --> 01:24:01,464
No matter what happen,
village safe forever.

857
01:25:28,103 --> 01:25:30,063
So, is this seat taken?

858
01:25:36,623 --> 01:25:38,423
I'm sorry.

859
01:28:32,260 --> 01:28:33,661
- Oh, no!
- What's wrong?

860
01:28:33,701 --> 01:28:37,900
- Quickly. There's danger. We must go.
- Why? I don't understand.

861
01:28:37,981 --> 01:28:41,221
Big storm. Be here soon.
Not safe here.

862
01:28:41,301 --> 01:28:43,741
- Where are we going now?
- Back to village.

863
01:29:27,700 --> 01:29:30,500
Mr. Miyagi, wait up!

864
01:29:30,580 --> 01:29:33,260
Do you believe all this wind?
This is wild.

865
01:29:33,300 --> 01:29:34,860
And it get wilder.

866
01:29:48,939 --> 01:29:50,620
Are those people out there?

867
01:29:52,820 --> 01:29:55,220
Come. We go help.

868
01:30:03,499 --> 01:30:06,659
Stay there!
We coming! Stay there!

869
01:30:06,740 --> 01:30:08,780
They need our help.

870
01:30:08,859 --> 01:30:11,019
Are you all right?
You okay?

871
01:30:11,100 --> 01:30:13,020
I got baby.

872
01:30:13,099 --> 01:30:14,980
I got the boy.

873
01:30:15,019 --> 01:30:17,739
Come on. Hang on. Hold on.

874
01:30:21,420 --> 01:30:24,099
- Oh, no!
- Sato's in there!

875
01:30:25,339 --> 01:30:27,300
Here. Take baby.

876
01:30:27,379 --> 01:30:30,300
I go find Sato. Go!

877
01:30:30,379 --> 01:30:33,099
- Kumiko, take him.
- Be careful. Let's go.

878
01:30:47,219 --> 01:30:49,260
Where uncle?

879
01:30:49,299 --> 01:30:50,819
He's dead.

880
01:30:58,419 --> 01:31:00,819
Come! Must work fast!

881
01:31:06,939 --> 01:31:10,259
Miyagi! Now you come to fight!

882
01:31:10,339 --> 01:31:11,659
Coward!

883
01:31:13,018 --> 01:31:15,459
Now when I am helpless!

884
01:31:15,539 --> 01:31:16,899
It won't move!

885
01:31:16,979 --> 01:31:19,779
You are lower than the storm!

886
01:31:19,819 --> 01:31:21,938
Now whole village see.

887
01:31:21,979 --> 01:31:25,459
This is only way you can win.

888
01:31:37,139 --> 01:31:39,778
Come, Daniel-san.
Easy, Sato.

889
01:31:39,859 --> 01:31:41,219
Easy.

890
01:31:41,298 --> 01:31:43,139
I got you, old friend.

891
01:31:46,059 --> 01:31:48,339
You'll be okay now.

892
01:32:01,338 --> 01:32:03,618
Come get me!

893
01:32:03,698 --> 01:32:05,058
Come get me!

894
01:32:05,138 --> 01:32:07,698
You take Mr. Sato back!
I'll get the girl!

895
01:32:11,858 --> 01:32:14,218
Just hang on!

896
01:32:15,338 --> 01:32:17,378
Don't let go.

897
01:32:18,858 --> 01:32:22,258
Uncle! Uncle!
I thought you were dead!

898
01:32:22,338 --> 01:32:24,298
I thought you were dead.

899
01:32:24,378 --> 01:32:25,738
Go help!

900
01:32:28,618 --> 01:32:30,218
Help him!

901
01:32:35,857 --> 01:32:38,698
I cannot help him.
I cannot.

902
01:32:56,098 --> 01:32:59,018
Hang on! Just hang on!
Hold tight!

903
01:33:15,497 --> 01:33:16,377
Hold on!

904
01:33:23,057 --> 01:33:25,777
Just hang on!
Give me your arm!

905
01:33:28,378 --> 01:33:29,897
Hold on tight!

906
01:33:36,617 --> 01:33:39,017
You're gonna be okay.
Hang on.

907
01:33:54,377 --> 01:33:56,657
Miyagi, let me go.

908
01:33:59,817 --> 01:34:01,417
You'll be okay.

909
01:34:04,736 --> 01:34:06,097
Thanks a lot.

910
01:34:22,736 --> 01:34:25,297
Now, to you...

911
01:34:25,377 --> 01:34:26,976
I am dead.

912
01:34:56,416 --> 01:34:58,456
How are they gonna
recover from this?

913
01:34:58,536 --> 01:35:00,976
All the seeds are gone.
The place is wrecked.

914
01:35:01,056 --> 01:35:03,616
- What are they gonna do now?
- Best they can.

915
01:35:06,216 --> 01:35:08,936
What is all this?
What's Sato doing here?

916
01:35:09,016 --> 01:35:10,576
Don't know.

917
01:35:23,615 --> 01:35:25,255
I come help rebuild.

918
01:35:26,016 --> 01:35:28,456
Here deed to village.

919
01:35:29,616 --> 01:35:32,456
Forgive me. I beg you.

920
01:35:34,816 --> 01:35:38,096
Oh, Sato.
Nothing to forgive.

921
01:35:39,135 --> 01:35:41,016
Now's a good time to ask him.

922
01:35:41,096 --> 01:35:43,176
It's not my place.

923
01:35:46,415 --> 01:35:48,936
Mr. Sato, O-bon dance is soon...

924
01:35:49,015 --> 01:35:52,616
and it'll be hard the way things are
to have it here in the village.

925
01:35:53,375 --> 01:35:55,376
What you ask of me?

926
01:35:55,455 --> 01:35:59,295
Well, can they have it in the castle?
That's where it belongs, isn't it?

927
01:36:04,296 --> 01:36:06,216
Your student become my teacher.

928
01:36:08,135 --> 01:36:10,616
O-bon will be held in castle.

929
01:36:11,375 --> 01:36:13,096
Now and forever!

930
01:36:14,616 --> 01:36:16,095
One condition.

931
01:36:17,695 --> 01:36:19,455
You dance with us.

932
01:36:20,855 --> 01:36:22,535
You got it.

933
01:36:30,975 --> 01:36:33,935
When you put your mind to it,
anything can happen.

934
01:36:34,015 --> 01:36:35,615
You're right.

935
01:37:55,494 --> 01:37:58,054
If it wasn't for you,
I'd be makin' a lot ofmistakes.

936
01:37:58,094 --> 01:38:00,534
Ifnot for you,
I not be here.

937
01:38:06,374 --> 01:38:08,774
Now remember,
you have nothing to worry about.

938
01:38:08,854 --> 01:38:11,134
I'm not worried.
I think I'm scared.

939
01:38:11,213 --> 01:38:13,174
You kiddin'?
I've seen you do it.

940
01:38:13,254 --> 01:38:16,614
You're gonna be terrific.
It's true.

941
01:38:16,694 --> 01:38:19,654
- Did I tell you you look beautiful?
- No.

942
01:38:20,534 --> 01:38:22,534
Well, you do.

943
01:38:34,173 --> 01:38:36,854
I've seen her practice.
She's really amazing.

944
01:39:32,453 --> 01:39:33,733
Behind you!

945
01:39:39,653 --> 01:39:41,453
Get back!

946
01:39:41,492 --> 01:39:43,493
- Get back or I'll kill her!
- Chozen!

947
01:39:44,293 --> 01:39:45,892
Don't do this.

948
01:39:45,973 --> 01:39:48,013
I was wrong.

949
01:39:48,052 --> 01:39:49,572
Hate is wrong.

950
01:39:49,613 --> 01:39:52,533
- lt's over.
- I cannot hear you, Uncle.

951
01:39:52,612 --> 01:39:54,973
I am dead to you, remember?

952
01:39:55,013 --> 01:39:58,053
Chozen, you are your uncle's
finest student.

953
01:39:58,092 --> 01:40:00,412
No disgrace him here.

954
01:40:00,493 --> 01:40:02,693
Your student disgrace me.

955
01:40:02,732 --> 01:40:04,932
I have been dishonored
all because of him.

956
01:40:05,013 --> 01:40:06,772
For whatever happened,
I apologize.

957
01:40:06,852 --> 01:40:09,452
Apology will not
give me back my honor!

958
01:40:09,492 --> 01:40:12,132
- Neither will this.
- In their eyes it will.

959
01:40:12,173 --> 01:40:15,412
No more talk.
You cross bridge, or I kill her!

960
01:40:21,292 --> 01:40:24,292
This not tournament.
This for real.

961
01:40:39,812 --> 01:40:42,212
Oy. No bridge.

962
01:41:09,572 --> 01:41:11,972
Now I dropped the bridge.
Let her go.

963
01:41:12,971 --> 01:41:16,172
- Come on!
- Now we fight to death!

964
01:42:24,010 --> 01:42:26,531
Step back, Daniel-san!
Step back!

965
01:44:03,130 --> 01:44:04,650
Live or die, man?

966
01:44:07,049 --> 01:44:08,370
Die.

967
01:44:09,889 --> 01:44:11,650
Wrong. Honk!

968
01:44:12,650 --> 01:44:22,650
