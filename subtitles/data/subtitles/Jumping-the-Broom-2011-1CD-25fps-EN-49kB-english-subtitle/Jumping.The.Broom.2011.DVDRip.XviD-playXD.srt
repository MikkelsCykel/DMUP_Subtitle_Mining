1
00:00:36,004 --> 00:00:38,241
Wow! Where did you come from?

2
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:41,410
You're beautiful, caring.

3
00:00:42,405 --> 00:00:44,163
And don't get me started
about that sexy body.

4
00:00:47,173 --> 00:00:49,275
You're the type of woman a man keeps.

5
00:00:50,597 --> 00:00:54,111
And I know you're working later,
but, baby, I need to see you tonight.

6
00:00:54,182 --> 00:00:56,356
Well, I wanna see you tonight, too.

7
00:00:57,703 --> 00:00:59,908
Baby, can I call you right back?

8
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:01,314
Yeah. No, I promise.

9
00:01:01,736 --> 00:01:05,179
All right, sexy. Yeah, I gotta go.
No, I promise, I promise.

10
00:01:05,993 --> 00:01:07,645
All right, beautiful. Bye.

11
00:01:09,191 --> 00:01:10,206
Breakfast?

12
00:01:12,392 --> 00:01:15,871
I gotta go. I just remembered
I have a 10:00 o'clock photo shoot.

13
00:01:19,623 --> 00:01:21,631
Oh, God, I did it again.

14
00:01:21,703 --> 00:01:23,411
I gave up the cookie for a cute face,

15
00:01:23,649 --> 00:01:25,795
nice body,
and some mediocre conversation.

16
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,801
I don't even think
he can spell "mediocre."

17
00:01:29,128 --> 00:01:31,235
I promise, God, again,

18
00:01:31,306 --> 00:01:35,048
that if you get me out of this situation
with some dignity...

19
00:01:36,583 --> 00:01:39,337
Okay, just get me out of here.

20
00:01:39,404 --> 00:01:42,696
I promise to only share my cookies
with my future husband.

21
00:01:42,761 --> 00:01:44,668
No more of this.

22
00:01:45,194 --> 00:01:49,026
And, God, because it's obvious
I don't know how to spot a human being,

23
00:01:49,102 --> 00:01:52,928
could you please make it clear
who you want me to be with?

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,426
I mean, clear clear,
the kind of clear that...

25
00:01:55,502 --> 00:01:57,321
-Hey...
-Oh, my God!

26
00:01:57,673 --> 00:01:59,366
Oh, my God! Oh, no!

27
00:02:00,073 --> 00:02:02,017
Are you okay? Oh, my God!

28
00:02:02,474 --> 00:02:03,621
Sir, are you okay?

29
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:06,440
I am so sorry! I didn't see you.
I mean, you came out of nowhere.

30
00:02:06,505 --> 00:02:08,232
I could've killed you. Do you know that?

31
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,893
I could've killed you! Are you okay?

32
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,331
You look okay, but you could be dying
of internal bleeding,

33
00:02:12,395 --> 00:02:14,569
where people have concussions
and they think they're fine

34
00:02:14,636 --> 00:02:16,741
and then they go to sleep
and then they never wake up.

35
00:02:16,811 --> 00:02:17,990
You could be dying.

36
00:02:18,061 --> 00:02:21,093
-Oh, my God, I killed you.
-I'm not dead. I'm alive.

37
00:02:21,164 --> 00:02:23,140
Well, listen, my name is Sabrina Watson.

38
00:02:23,213 --> 00:02:25,547
I have great insurance
and an excellent dry cleaner.

39
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:27,715
I even have a good enough job
to pay for dinner.

40
00:02:27,786 --> 00:02:30,407
I clearly owe you, and you could have
whatever you want on the menu.

41
00:02:30,478 --> 00:02:32,369
-Well, except for the cookie plate.
-Sabrina?

42
00:02:32,463 --> 00:02:33,921
Sabrina Watson?

43
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,096
Breathe.

44
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,397
I'm fine.

45
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:54,084
God, did I say
how much I love your sense of humor?

46
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,786
-Verdict?
-Amazing.

47
00:02:58,859 --> 00:03:01,352
My parents took me to see Carmen
when I was a little girl.

48
00:03:01,456 --> 00:03:05,514
Back then, you know, all that mattered
to me was the music and the costumes.

49
00:03:05,586 --> 00:03:09,612
But now, I realize it's all about love
and anger and how they're linked,

50
00:03:09,651 --> 00:03:11,884
-but, ultimately...
-Incompatible.

51
00:03:12,337 --> 00:03:14,788
Jason Taylor, you are full of surprises.

52
00:03:14,863 --> 00:03:16,043
Babe, I have you to thank for it.

53
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:17,843
I mean, to think that I grew up
in this city

54
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:20,423
and all this time I had no idea...

55
00:03:20,496 --> 00:03:21,873
Come on, let's go.

56
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:23,080
...that all this was available to us.

57
00:03:23,151 --> 00:03:24,715
-I mean, opera?
-You liked it?

58
00:03:24,786 --> 00:03:25,932
-I loved it.
-Really?

59
00:03:26,002 --> 00:03:28,107
But, babe, you can't tell the guys
about all the stuff we do.

60
00:03:28,177 --> 00:03:30,731
They're still hazing me
about the picnic we had in Central Park.

61
00:03:30,802 --> 00:03:32,810
-Okay, fine.
-You promise?

62
00:03:32,881 --> 00:03:34,824
-Pinky swear.
-I trust you.

63
00:03:36,501 --> 00:03:38,986
So, I hear the Peking Opera
is fantastic.

64
00:03:39,059 --> 00:03:41,360
Supposedly, it's like nothing
you've ever seen before.

65
00:03:41,426 --> 00:03:42,574
Peking?

66
00:03:43,826 --> 00:03:45,199
You got the offer.

67
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:48,334
It's cutting-edge IP law
and a 20% pay raise.

68
00:03:48,402 --> 00:03:50,125
-Wow.
-Couldn't say no.

69
00:03:50,194 --> 00:03:52,781
I understand. Congrats.

70
00:03:52,884 --> 00:03:54,607
When would you start?

71
00:03:55,221 --> 00:03:57,106
-Two months.
-Two months?

72
00:03:57,872 --> 00:03:59,850
-So soon?
-Yeah.

73
00:03:59,923 --> 00:04:02,411
Wow. Two months.

74
00:04:02,483 --> 00:04:05,267
Jason, I know we haven't been together
that long,

75
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:09,424
and I probably have no right to
ask you this, but I just feel like...

76
00:04:11,701 --> 00:04:13,646
I don't know.

77
00:04:13,718 --> 00:04:16,084
Do you think we could
try to make it work?

78
00:04:16,148 --> 00:04:19,118
Babe, China is really far away.

79
00:04:21,045 --> 00:04:22,289
-I don't know.
-There's the telephone

80
00:04:22,357 --> 00:04:23,984
-and Internet and Skype, and...
-Skype.

81
00:04:24,053 --> 00:04:26,574
And I'd be back every two months
for meetings.

82
00:04:26,678 --> 00:04:27,855
Look...

83
00:04:30,741 --> 00:04:33,360
I just... The long distance thing, I...

84
00:04:34,134 --> 00:04:37,100
I don't know.
I don't... I don't believe in it.

85
00:04:40,088 --> 00:04:42,192
So, what does that mean?

86
00:04:42,263 --> 00:04:47,598
It means that you have a really
good opportunity in front of you,

87
00:04:49,015 --> 00:04:51,697
and I'm not gonna stand
in the way of it.

88
00:04:53,174 --> 00:04:56,790
Well, it sounds to me
like you made up your mind.

89
00:04:57,975 --> 00:04:59,631
It was a fun night.

90
00:05:10,905 --> 00:05:15,099
You're such a perfect lover

91
00:05:16,985 --> 00:05:21,461
And, baby, you could do better than me

92
00:05:21,532 --> 00:05:25,687
But you stuck by me like a soldier

93
00:05:27,549 --> 00:05:32,054
Sweet loving until...

94
00:05:33,148 --> 00:05:34,575
Look, Sabrina,

95
00:05:35,579 --> 00:05:38,165
ever since I met you, I've felt like...

96
00:05:38,715 --> 00:05:41,433
Like I can accomplish anything,
anywhere.

97
00:05:42,427 --> 00:05:46,553
New York, China. It doesn't matter,
as long as we're together.

98
00:05:47,548 --> 00:05:48,823
You've introduced me to a world

99
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,475
that I can't even begin
to imagine living without you.

100
00:05:51,545 --> 00:05:53,075
I don't want to.

101
00:05:54,045 --> 00:05:56,826
I want you in my life forever.

102
00:05:57,885 --> 00:05:59,770
Sabrina, I prayed on it,

103
00:06:00,636 --> 00:06:03,482
and God answered me with you.

104
00:06:09,914 --> 00:06:11,379
Sabrina Watson,

105
00:06:14,654 --> 00:06:15,733
would you marry me?

106
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,743
You scared me!

107
00:06:19,644 --> 00:06:20,793
Babe, is that a yes?

108
00:06:20,862 --> 00:06:21,875
Yes!

109
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:27,706
-You said yes, right?
-Yes.

110
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,884
Come here.

111
00:06:31,422 --> 00:06:37,651
I'm so unpredictable
yet your love's unconditional for me

112
00:06:38,204 --> 00:06:41,659
And I wanna know why

113
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:46,135
How can you love me so much, girl?

114
00:06:46,813 --> 00:06:51,293
Put up with all of the crazy things I do

115
00:06:51,491 --> 00:06:52,503
It's incredible.

116
00:06:52,576 --> 00:06:54,585
-You like it?
-It's amazing.

117
00:07:09,476 --> 00:07:14,463
JUMPING THE BROOM

118
00:08:51,497 --> 00:08:52,611
Mabel?

119
00:08:52,684 --> 00:08:56,420
Let's give each of the couples
an extra bag of the wasabi peanuts.

120
00:08:56,488 --> 00:08:58,399
Yes, Mrs. Watson.

121
00:08:58,472 --> 00:09:00,064
-I'm sorry.
-Amy. Are you okay?

122
00:09:00,135 --> 00:09:02,242
Yes, I tend to get a little nervous
before a big event.

123
00:09:02,313 --> 00:09:04,320
You do plan big events for a living, no?

124
00:09:04,325 --> 00:09:08,126
Yes, I do, ma'am.
And as to yours, tomorrow is day one.

125
00:09:08,203 --> 00:09:12,840
The workmen will arrive in the morning
to hoist the tent for the reception.

126
00:09:13,134 --> 00:09:16,448
Jason and Sabrina will meet with
Reverend James to discuss the service.

127
00:09:16,652 --> 00:09:18,921
The bulk of the guests will be arriving
on the midday ferry,

128
00:09:18,988 --> 00:09:21,056
followed by 3:00 pm, the rehearsal.

129
00:09:21,129 --> 00:09:23,073
And then cocktails
and the rehearsal dinner in the tent.

130
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:25,420
Amy, remember, I just want everything
to be very simple,

131
00:09:25,487 --> 00:09:27,140
elegant and modern, you know?

132
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:29,733
And I need to have a long table

133
00:09:29,806 --> 00:09:32,456
so we can all sit together
like one big, happy family.

134
00:09:32,524 --> 00:09:35,874
That is gonna be so fun to do
at the round tables I was told to order.

135
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,393
Right. Not to worry about that.
I'll just make that go bye-bye.

136
00:09:40,462 --> 00:09:42,218
-Good.
-Continue.

137
00:09:42,285 --> 00:09:46,180
Right. Day two, the big day, Saturday.
Breakfast on the deck.

138
00:09:46,255 --> 00:09:49,252
Later, the women will primp and groom
while the men play football.

139
00:09:49,323 --> 00:09:51,974
A Watson family tradition
I wish I could ignore.

140
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,567
Like the round tables,
I can make that go away.

141
00:09:56,782 --> 00:09:57,989
Back to the wedding.

142
00:09:58,059 --> 00:10:01,737
All right, rental chairs and lanterns
will be arranged here on the lawn.

143
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:04,781
The ceremony begins at 2:00 pm sharp
with dinner and dancing to follow.

144
00:10:05,106 --> 00:10:09,414
And on Sunday morning, Jason and I
will be Mr, and Mrs. Jason Edgar Taylor.

145
00:10:09,488 --> 00:10:10,531
Girl!

146
00:10:12,657 --> 00:10:13,962
-Oh, wow. Okay.
-Yeah.

147
00:10:15,026 --> 00:10:16,999
-Well, I'm gonna check on...
-What's wrong?

148
00:10:19,311 --> 00:10:21,038
Mom, come on.

149
00:10:21,106 --> 00:10:25,164
It's just... It's just all so rushed.

150
00:10:25,232 --> 00:10:28,047
No time for an engagement party
or bridal shower.

151
00:10:28,113 --> 00:10:32,203
Really, Sabrina.
It looks as if we have no home training.

152
00:10:32,273 --> 00:10:36,104
We should've taken months to plan this.
Really, why the rush?

153
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:38,375
If you're pregnant, you can tell me.

154
00:10:38,574 --> 00:10:41,127
For the millionth time,
no, I'm not pregnant.

155
00:10:41,359 --> 00:10:42,856
Okay? Trust me.

156
00:10:42,929 --> 00:10:45,683
Jason and I are in love, really in love.

157
00:10:46,002 --> 00:10:48,273
We wanna go to China
as husband and wife, a team.

158
00:10:48,341 --> 00:10:51,052
Jason makes a good impression,
but we haven't met his family yet.

159
00:10:51,314 --> 00:10:52,743
What are they like?

160
00:10:52,817 --> 00:10:55,338
Amy! Let's put some greens in
with the roses, okay?

161
00:10:55,411 --> 00:10:56,871
-For, like, a pop of color.
-Sabrina.

162
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,302
And Bellinis. Mom, you love Bellinis.
Let's serve Bellinis as well, okay?

163
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:01,647
-Sabrina!
-Yes?

164
00:11:01,714 --> 00:11:03,853
-What are they like?
-I don't know.

165
00:11:03,923 --> 00:11:06,060
You don't know? Sabrina,
your father and I have invested

166
00:11:06,133 --> 00:11:08,073
over half a million dollars
in your education.

167
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:11,051
-Communicate.
-I haven't met them yet.

168
00:11:11,699 --> 00:11:14,930
I know. I tried, but it was
hard for Jason to work it out!

169
00:11:14,996 --> 00:11:17,233
-Sabrina!
-Mrs. Taylor is a very busy woman.

170
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,827
-Sabrina.
-Mom,

171
00:11:19,828 --> 00:11:21,203
everybody's gonna love each other

172
00:11:21,268 --> 00:11:23,210
because Jason and I love each other.

173
00:11:23,286 --> 00:11:26,283
How can you say you love him
when you don't know them?

174
00:11:26,358 --> 00:11:28,749
They could be awful

175
00:11:28,824 --> 00:11:30,346
-or:::
-Or great.

176
00:11:30,838 --> 00:11:34,130
-Come on. You worry too much!
-No, you don't worry enough.

177
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:36,584
Well, it's all under control.
Right, Amy?

178
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:40,455
-Okay, Miss O'Neal. Next!
-So, when are you leaving?

179
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:41,996
You know all those people over
at the Vineyard,

180
00:11:42,071 --> 00:11:44,526
they are so loaded,
even their servants are rich.

181
00:11:45,655 --> 00:11:48,501
I can't believe little Jason
is getting married this weekend,

182
00:11:48,567 --> 00:11:49,910
and I'm not gonna be there.

183
00:11:50,072 --> 00:11:51,414
Well,
of course you're not gonna be there.

184
00:11:51,479 --> 00:11:55,153
You wearing a ankle bracelet
and it's not for fashion. Next!

185
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,239
What's the girl like?

186
00:11:56,312 --> 00:11:59,158
Miss O'Neal, go on, now.
I gotta go to work. Next!

187
00:11:59,224 --> 00:12:01,326
Come on up here, baby.
Hurry up. I ain't got all day.

188
00:12:05,336 --> 00:12:06,547
What?

189
00:12:09,048 --> 00:12:10,990
-One minute, baby.
-Come on, girl, don't...

190
00:12:11,062 --> 00:12:12,495
-Shonda!
-Pam, I'm busy.

191
00:12:12,569 --> 00:12:14,194
You see this long line
we have out here?

192
00:12:14,265 --> 00:12:15,541
Excuse us, excuse us.

193
00:12:15,864 --> 00:12:18,258
-What's the problem, Pam?
-I have tried to be nice to this girl,

194
00:12:18,332 --> 00:12:21,012
but you know by now she should've come
over here to Brooklyn to meet me.

195
00:12:21,177 --> 00:12:22,705
You will not believe it.

196
00:12:22,779 --> 00:12:26,291
She sent me a text message.
A text message!

197
00:12:26,363 --> 00:12:29,077
Talking 'bout she want me
to bring some baby pictures of Jason

198
00:12:29,146 --> 00:12:31,415
so she can put 'em
in the wedding program.

199
00:12:31,481 --> 00:12:35,343
She treating me like I'm her secretary,
not the mother-in-law to be!

200
00:12:35,419 --> 00:12:38,069
She got Jason's nose all open, talking
about she gonna take him to China.

201
00:12:38,137 --> 00:12:40,758
China! My Jason don't like
nothing sweet and sour.

202
00:12:40,827 --> 00:12:42,739
This girl need to
have a little more respect for me!

203
00:12:42,814 --> 00:12:44,466
Why are your panties all in a wad?

204
00:12:44,536 --> 00:12:48,148
Didn't you tell me that Jason hadn't
met her family, either?

205
00:12:48,217 --> 00:12:49,628
Heifer, whose side you on?

206
00:12:50,107 --> 00:12:52,723
All this stuff going on,
her text messaging me

207
00:12:52,794 --> 00:12:56,591
when she can pick up a telephone
and call me like I'm a human being.

208
00:12:56,665 --> 00:12:58,805
I don't play this. Strike one.

209
00:13:01,179 --> 00:13:03,254
Don't forget about
your anger management classes, Pam.

210
00:13:03,357 --> 00:13:04,633
Calm down.

211
00:13:08,668 --> 00:13:11,003
Honey, you gonna have
to go get back in line.

212
00:13:11,068 --> 00:13:12,117
I'm going to lunch.

213
00:13:12,477 --> 00:13:13,424
What?

214
00:13:14,046 --> 00:13:17,306
Our guests arrive tomorrow,
so we will need to prepare every room.

215
00:13:17,374 --> 00:13:20,441
All the linens need to be changed.
The floors need to sparkle.

216
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:22,552
-And sparkle they will, Mrs. Watson.
-Each of the guest rooms

217
00:13:22,654 --> 00:13:24,444
needs to get a bouquet
of summer flowers.

218
00:13:24,509 --> 00:13:26,649
-Yes, Mrs. Watson.
-And we have to assemble the gift boxes

219
00:13:26,782 --> 00:13:30,100
-for all of our out-of-town guests.
-Yes, Mrs. Watson.

220
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:33,555
Where in hell are you?

221
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:36,019
Meeting ran long.
I'm on my way to the airport now.

222
00:13:36,094 --> 00:13:38,585
Did you forget that we have 50 people
arriving here tomorrow

223
00:13:38,655 --> 00:13:39,831
for our daughter's wedding?

224
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,655
Your sarcasm is unattractive.

225
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,686
Gregory, I cannot tolerate
one of your disappearing acts.

226
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:47,930
-I am not doing this alone.
-Yeah. Calm down.

227
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,301
You're not alone. Like I said,
I'm on my way to the airport.

228
00:13:54,271 --> 00:13:55,254
Where were we?

229
00:13:55,488 --> 00:13:57,399
All right. Where were we?

230
00:13:58,144 --> 00:14:00,478
Yeah. Dissolution of property.

231
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,932
Gregg, I can't keep up this charade.

232
00:14:05,153 --> 00:14:09,561
I've known Claudine for a long time,
and I do owe her a modicum of respect.

233
00:14:10,209 --> 00:14:12,446
You have to tell her, or I will.

234
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:23,363
Jason!

235
00:16:23,434 --> 00:16:26,248
-Wifey-to-be, wifey-to-be.
-What are you doing?

236
00:16:26,314 --> 00:16:27,942
God, the stairs weren't good enough
for you?

237
00:16:28,013 --> 00:16:31,244
I'm old school, babe. I got the horse
double-parked downstairs.

238
00:16:31,884 --> 00:16:34,404
You know how they do it in the movies?

239
00:16:38,508 --> 00:16:39,853
What's wrong, babe?

240
00:16:40,524 --> 00:16:42,215
I'm just really nervous
about meeting your mom.

241
00:16:42,632 --> 00:16:44,066
I need to know more about her.

242
00:16:44,237 --> 00:16:46,887
-Like what?
-I don't know, just, you know, details.

243
00:16:46,955 --> 00:16:48,101
Details are what make a person.

244
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:51,171
Like what's her taste in art?
Is she more MoMA or Met?

245
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:52,904
-Does she eat sushi or soul food?
-Baby...

246
00:16:52,972 --> 00:16:54,760
Does she wanna play Mahalia Jackson
or Michael Jackson?

247
00:16:54,986 --> 00:16:56,168
Breathe.

248
00:16:56,878 --> 00:16:58,885
Okay. Let's see, my mom.

249
00:16:59,534 --> 00:17:01,959
She's a very sweet...

250
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:03,365
Yeah?

251
00:17:03,436 --> 00:17:06,286
...gentle, soft-spoken woman.

252
00:17:06,352 --> 00:17:07,560
-Really?
-Just like you.

253
00:17:08,558 --> 00:17:09,833
Come here.

254
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:21,987
-Oh, God.
-I know, I know.

255
00:17:27,663 --> 00:17:30,732
Wait. Oh, my gosh.
Sorry, Jason, I'm sorry.

256
00:17:31,696 --> 00:17:33,867
-I'm sorry, I just...
-I know.

257
00:17:33,936 --> 00:17:36,587
-I can't do that.
-The promise you made with God, right?

258
00:17:36,658 --> 00:17:39,952
-Yes, and you should respect it.
-I respect it, babe, but it ain't easy.

259
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:41,547
I mean, look at you. I mean, come on.

260
00:17:41,619 --> 00:17:44,969
-Can we just keep that open?
-No, we can't. We can talk.

261
00:17:45,044 --> 00:17:46,665
-Talk?
-Yes.

262
00:17:47,346 --> 00:17:48,327
French.

263
00:17:50,801 --> 00:17:52,144
I don't know what to say.

264
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:53,356
Just say anything.

265
00:17:55,571 --> 00:17:57,031
Please don't be mad.

266
00:17:57,105 --> 00:17:59,563
But I am afraid that when we're on
our honeymoon,

267
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:01,741
It will be that time of the month.

268
00:18:02,482 --> 00:18:04,555
I don't know what you just said,
but it sounded so good.

269
00:18:04,627 --> 00:18:06,037
Did it?

270
00:18:06,165 --> 00:18:07,855
Sabrina! Reverend James is here!

271
00:18:07,955 --> 00:18:09,166
See? You hear that?

272
00:18:09,235 --> 00:18:10,894
That's God talking through my mom.

273
00:18:13,234 --> 00:18:14,413
Oh, my God.

274
00:18:15,571 --> 00:18:17,456
You couldn't control it?

275
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,053
I'm okay with this waiting thing,

276
00:18:19,124 --> 00:18:21,644
but he is pissed
at my choice in women right now.

277
00:18:22,453 --> 00:18:27,820
-Say you're sorry. Say you're sorry.
-I'm sorry. Kind of.

278
00:18:27,891 --> 00:18:29,005
-It's not working.
-Not really.

279
00:18:29,077 --> 00:18:31,019
-French?
-Get outta here.

280
00:18:31,093 --> 00:18:33,034
-Sabrina!
-I'm coming, Mom!

281
00:18:33,877 --> 00:18:36,880
Maybe we could get to the last detail
of this wedding, the reading.

282
00:18:36,951 --> 00:18:40,363
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
I was thinking Jude, Chapter three.

283
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,008
"The quality of mercy is not strained.

284
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:44,559
It falls like a gentle rain
from the heavens."

285
00:18:44,632 --> 00:18:45,677
That's Shakespeare.

286
00:18:46,263 --> 00:18:48,530
-That's not Jude three?
-There is no Jude three.

287
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,745
-There's no Jude three?
-No.

288
00:18:50,101 --> 00:18:54,475
I was thinking Corinthians 13.
"Love is patient, love is kind."

289
00:18:54,548 --> 00:18:56,273
How about John 15?
That's my mother's favorite.

290
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:58,798
Well, it's our wedding, so...

291
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:02,002
Well, babe, it would really make
my mother happy, come on.

292
00:19:02,264 --> 00:19:04,881
Yeah. And when she gets married again,
they can read it for her, okay?

293
00:19:06,742 --> 00:19:08,338
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
hold up a minute.

294
00:19:08,408 --> 00:19:11,791
Maybe we should just
look at Genesis 2:24.

295
00:19:11,864 --> 00:19:14,896
It says, "For this cause shall a man
leave his mother and his father

296
00:19:14,967 --> 00:19:15,983
"and take unto him a wife

297
00:19:16,056 --> 00:19:18,773
"and then they shall cleave
and become one flesh."

298
00:19:21,017 --> 00:19:22,740
Now, that... That feels good.

299
00:19:22,807 --> 00:19:24,599
That is a good one. That's a good one.

300
00:19:24,665 --> 00:19:27,984
Could we possibly get back
to you on this one, Rev?

301
00:19:28,155 --> 00:19:29,166
Certainly, certainly.

302
00:19:29,274 --> 00:19:30,256
Let's talk about it.

303
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:32,151
Sabrina, dear,

304
00:19:32,635 --> 00:19:34,422
I understand that you love each other

305
00:19:34,488 --> 00:19:37,716
and that you're maybe even meant
to be together.

306
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:44,314
But I should warn you that
sometimes life will really test you.

307
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:49,113
Well, we'll pass. I mean,
Reverend James, Jason was sent to me.

308
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,772
He's my soul mate.

309
00:19:52,379 --> 00:19:53,906
That's so sweet.

310
00:19:54,687 --> 00:19:58,098
But even a soul mate
can really test you.

311
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:03,798
You've known me since I was just
a wee little thing, and now...

312
00:20:03,868 --> 00:20:06,454
-Pigtails and braces.
-Yes!

313
00:20:06,524 --> 00:20:09,342
-Look at you now. So wonderful.
-That's right. Can you believe it?

314
00:20:09,407 --> 00:20:12,920
I tell you what,
I'm gonna have to leave you lovebirds

315
00:20:12,993 --> 00:20:15,226
and get on back to the church

316
00:20:15,293 --> 00:20:17,683
so we can have
this marvelous wedding of yours.

317
00:20:17,756 --> 00:20:19,482
Thank you!

318
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,177
-Be sweet, dear.
-Thank you so much.

319
00:20:21,247 --> 00:20:23,319
-And take care.
-Thanks.

320
00:20:23,421 --> 00:20:24,851
-We'll talk soon.
-All right, Rev.

321
00:20:24,926 --> 00:20:27,061
-All the best. See you all. Bye-bye.
-All right, see you tomorrow.

322
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:28,345
-Take care.
-Bye.

323
00:20:30,397 --> 00:20:32,122
It's almost noon.
I gotta go pick up my mom, all right?

324
00:20:32,191 --> 00:20:33,784
No, no, no, no!
You're not going anywhere.

325
00:20:33,854 --> 00:20:35,831
-What do you mean, babe?
-Amy sent a car for her.

326
00:20:35,903 --> 00:20:38,391
-Amy sent a car for my mom?
-Yes.

327
00:20:38,877 --> 00:20:40,255
Babe, this ain't gonna be good.

328
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:42,303
What do you mean?
I'm sure it was a nice car.

329
00:20:46,402 --> 00:20:47,380
Show her how to pose, will you?

330
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:51,511
Oh, my goodness! Stop all that now!

331
00:20:54,688 --> 00:20:57,077
All right, just smile, Pam! Okay...

332
00:20:57,153 --> 00:20:58,781
Don't touch my baby's pie!

333
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:47,776
-Where's Willie Earl?
-No, he could be anywhere.

334
00:21:50,276 --> 00:21:54,206
I see you been around the world.
You got a few stamps in your passport.

335
00:21:54,278 --> 00:21:56,284
It's none of your business.

336
00:21:57,864 --> 00:22:00,281
Just trying to
have a polite conversation.

337
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:03,652
I'm sure whatever distant land
you come from that line about stamps

338
00:22:03,716 --> 00:22:06,204
may work as a natural aphrodisiac.

339
00:22:06,278 --> 00:22:08,863
To me, however, it's just country.

340
00:22:11,971 --> 00:22:14,341
Ain't nothing wrong
with a little biscuit and gravy.

341
00:22:15,621 --> 00:22:17,215
Please.

342
00:22:17,955 --> 00:22:19,551
Don't walk away from your future.

343
00:22:19,622 --> 00:22:23,005
Let's go, let's go, let's go.
Please get me out of here.

344
00:22:27,686 --> 00:22:29,476
See, that's what I'm talking about.

345
00:22:29,574 --> 00:22:32,443
-Be careful with that.
-He know what he doing.

346
00:22:35,209 --> 00:22:39,909
Shonda, I am trying to be nice,
but who are they trying to impress?

347
00:22:39,975 --> 00:22:41,983
A car? A driver?

348
00:22:42,056 --> 00:22:45,406
Why couldn't they send somebody from
the family down here to pick us up?

349
00:22:45,481 --> 00:22:48,164
And where the hell is Jason?
What you looking at?

350
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,505
Girl, what you think I'm looking at?

351
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:52,444
It's August in the Vineyard.
I'm looking for Barack and Michelle.

352
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:53,830
Oh, God.

353
00:22:55,689 --> 00:22:56,965
Have you seen Sabrina? Thank you.

354
00:22:57,033 --> 00:22:58,976
No, but, Mrs. Watson,
the calligrapher broke her arm

355
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:01,472
and she can't finish the guest cards.
So, I was...

356
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:07,332
Okay. And that's not your problem.
That's my problem. Moving on.

357
00:23:07,399 --> 00:23:08,679
The bedrooms are all ready.

358
00:23:08,747 --> 00:23:10,319
Thank you, Mabel. Have you seen Sabrina?

359
00:23:10,442 --> 00:23:11,686
I'm right here, Mom.

360
00:23:12,459 --> 00:23:13,470
Where's Sebastian?

361
00:23:13,543 --> 00:23:15,486
He missed the ferry, but he'll be here
for the cocktail party.

362
00:23:15,562 --> 00:23:17,635
-You all are working my last nerve.
-Relax.

363
00:23:17,707 --> 00:23:19,560
-Hey! Sweetie!
-Hi, Dad.

364
00:23:19,624 --> 00:23:22,050
So good to see you!

365
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:24,644
All right, they'll be here any minute.
Go change.

366
00:23:24,715 --> 00:23:27,399
That sounded a little bit like,
"Go fetch."

367
00:23:28,205 --> 00:23:29,315
Dad, Mom is right.

368
00:23:29,386 --> 00:23:32,519
You need to make a good impression
on my future mother-in-law, okay?

369
00:23:32,587 --> 00:23:33,569
Absolutely, sweetie.

370
00:23:33,645 --> 00:23:34,986
Thanks, Dad.

371
00:23:37,229 --> 00:23:40,328
-That's them! They're here!
-Mom, how do I look?

372
00:23:40,395 --> 00:23:41,541
-Do I have anything in my teeth?
-Sabrina.

373
00:23:41,612 --> 00:23:43,718
-What about my nose?
-Sabrina, that is vile.

374
00:23:44,107 --> 00:23:45,418
Now, remember who you are.

375
00:23:45,806 --> 00:23:48,039
You are my angel.

376
00:23:51,885 --> 00:23:52,999
Hello.

377
00:23:54,573 --> 00:23:55,783
Claudine.

378
00:23:56,746 --> 00:23:59,368
-Geneva.
-Auntie! You made it!

379
00:24:01,265 --> 00:24:03,720
Look at you. You're beautiful.

380
00:24:05,036 --> 00:24:07,245
Why didn't you respond
to the wedding invitation?

381
00:24:07,855 --> 00:24:10,028
The mail on the island
is so unpredictable.

382
00:24:10,096 --> 00:24:11,589
Are there no phones on the island?

383
00:24:11,664 --> 00:24:13,124
-Claudie.
-Mom.

384
00:24:15,504 --> 00:24:16,648
Where are you staying?

385
00:24:16,783 --> 00:24:18,671
In Grand-Mère's old room, of course.

386
00:24:18,734 --> 00:24:21,036
-See? Room for me.
-Come on. I have so much to tell you!

387
00:24:21,102 --> 00:24:23,691
I can't wait to show you
what I bought you. It's see-through.

388
00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:25,615
-So, it's really a gift for Jason.
-And where is he?

389
00:24:25,678 --> 00:24:27,820
I need to see the man
who stole my little girl's heart.

390
00:24:27,888 --> 00:24:30,756
Auntie, you are going to love him.
First of all...

391
00:24:30,831 --> 00:24:35,535
Just bring 'em in here and drop 'em.
Drop 'em right here. Put it...

392
00:24:36,305 --> 00:24:39,717
She sure can pack for a two-day wedding.

393
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:44,203
You know, if you don't mind me asking,
Mrs. Watson, she's like a...

394
00:24:44,276 --> 00:24:45,897
She's like a couple shades lighter
than you.

395
00:24:45,967 --> 00:24:48,458
Is that... Is that the normal kind...

396
00:24:51,218 --> 00:24:54,796
Fair question. She's like a mocha.

397
00:24:54,867 --> 00:24:58,278
You're like a... I don't know,
like a milk chocolate.

398
00:24:58,866 --> 00:25:00,012
Got it.

399
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:05,489
It's pretty nasty. What is this, Auntie?

400
00:25:05,589 --> 00:25:08,653
Now, now, this is not
for your honeymoon night. No, no, no.

401
00:25:08,723 --> 00:25:11,985
No, this is for when you guys fight
or you want something expensive.

402
00:25:12,051 --> 00:25:13,041
You put this on

403
00:25:13,113 --> 00:25:15,622
-and you cook him some dinner.
-Got it.

404
00:25:15,625 --> 00:25:17,366
I might not know anything
about marriage,

405
00:25:17,446 --> 00:25:20,240
but I do know
how to help you guys stay married.

406
00:25:20,307 --> 00:25:21,803
Auntie, I think you got the perfect one.

407
00:25:21,877 --> 00:25:23,885
-I love it! It's the best.
-Good!

408
00:25:24,149 --> 00:25:25,973
-I love you, chérie.
-I love you so much.

409
00:25:27,252 --> 00:25:28,779
Do everybody out here
got their own boat?

410
00:25:28,853 --> 00:25:31,186
I don't wanna get on
no boats around here.

411
00:25:31,252 --> 00:25:33,195
Make you feel
like they're taking you back to Africa.

412
00:25:33,459 --> 00:25:34,573
This place is amazing.

413
00:25:36,215 --> 00:25:39,026
This is so beautiful.
Look at these houses!

414
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:42,061
You know, I was thinking
I could represent Jason's father,

415
00:25:42,133 --> 00:25:45,582
say a few kind words over dinner
about love and marriage.

416
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:48,181
Okay, so now you a pro at marriage?

417
00:25:48,246 --> 00:25:49,651
-Could be.
-All right.

418
00:25:49,876 --> 00:25:52,628
So, how many marriages have you had,
Willie Earl?

419
00:25:52,695 --> 00:25:54,000
-Three.
-Who?

420
00:25:54,614 --> 00:25:57,646
Four, four, four, four times.

421
00:25:57,718 --> 00:25:59,061
But I married one of them twice.

422
00:25:59,415 --> 00:26:02,314
And don't forget about that fiasco
in Mexico last year, remember that?

423
00:26:02,392 --> 00:26:05,010
No, Willie Earl, she was fine.
I would've went to Mexico for that.

424
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,992
What a brother will do for the taco.

425
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:09,136
And a burrito and rice and beans.

426
00:26:09,207 --> 00:26:11,247
You probably left a baby down there,
Willie Earl.

427
00:26:11,321 --> 00:26:12,694
Come on, Pam.

428
00:26:12,762 --> 00:26:14,253
Come on, Pammy Pam.

429
00:26:14,616 --> 00:26:18,161
So what they didn't come meet us at
the dock, and you haven't met the girl?

430
00:26:18,231 --> 00:26:20,567
But we're here now.
Can we please have a good time?

431
00:26:20,632 --> 00:26:23,002
I don't care what y'all talking about.
This is nice.

432
00:26:23,068 --> 00:26:25,138
Get picked up like this every day.

433
00:26:34,809 --> 00:26:37,298
They got their own lake or something?

434
00:26:39,387 --> 00:26:40,334
Are you serious?

435
00:26:40,409 --> 00:26:44,445
-You guys, look at that! Oh, my God!
-This is nice.

436
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:46,551
You guys,
it's like the Kennedy Compound!

437
00:26:46,618 --> 00:26:47,963
That's gotta be an apartment complex.

438
00:26:48,028 --> 00:26:49,073
They got workers and everything.

439
00:26:49,146 --> 00:26:51,701
Look at 'em.
They got white people working.

440
00:26:51,773 --> 00:26:52,980
I bet they got, like, five bathrooms.

441
00:26:53,048 --> 00:26:55,351
-Doing good for theyself.
-Come on, y'all. Calm down.

442
00:26:55,416 --> 00:26:57,142
We done seen houses bigger than this.

443
00:26:57,371 --> 00:26:59,738
-Where?
-No, we haven't!

444
00:26:59,802 --> 00:27:01,711
Black folks own this? No.

445
00:27:04,029 --> 00:27:06,104
They're dressing 'em different now.
You look rich.

446
00:27:06,176 --> 00:27:08,279
Well,
does money make you more beautiful?

447
00:27:08,348 --> 00:27:11,661
If you fat and unattractive,
money certainly will help.

448
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:18,137
-Willie Earl.
-Hey, whassup, Jay?

449
00:27:18,527 --> 00:27:20,982
-How you doing, man? Good to see you.
-My love to you, boy.

450
00:27:21,055 --> 00:27:22,614
Long time no see.

451
00:27:23,387 --> 00:27:25,212
Welcome to the Vineyard, Mom.

452
00:27:25,277 --> 00:27:27,863
-You sent a car to get your mother?
-Only the best for you.

453
00:27:27,933 --> 00:27:30,268
Well, the best would've been
for you to pick me up.

454
00:27:30,334 --> 00:27:32,534
I love you, too, Mom.
Mom, this is Sabrina.

455
00:27:32,603 --> 00:27:33,654
Hello.

456
00:27:37,216 --> 00:27:40,509
Hi! Mrs. Taylor!
It is so nice to finally meet you!

457
00:27:40,572 --> 00:27:41,818
Isn't she great, Mom?

458
00:27:41,886 --> 00:27:44,189
I'm sorry. I just...

459
00:27:44,254 --> 00:27:46,643
I didn't think a handshake
expressed the moment, you know?

460
00:27:46,719 --> 00:27:47,799
No.

461
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:49,977
I'm a hugger. I like to hug.

462
00:27:50,047 --> 00:27:51,123
I can see that.

463
00:27:52,287 --> 00:27:53,269
Sorry.

464
00:27:53,342 --> 00:27:54,969
I'm Claudine Watson.

465
00:27:55,999 --> 00:27:57,013
Pam Taylor.

466
00:27:57,085 --> 00:28:00,699
Well, may I say that you've certainly
raised a wonderful man.

467
00:28:00,767 --> 00:28:02,262
Thank you. He is wonderful.

468
00:28:02,338 --> 00:28:04,248
I wish I could say the same about you
and your daughter.

469
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:12,792
I said that the wrong way.
I mean, I wish I had met her earlier,

470
00:28:12,865 --> 00:28:17,469
-before now, and then I could say...
-This is my family.

471
00:28:17,568 --> 00:28:19,542
Shonda. She is my mom's best friend.

472
00:28:20,164 --> 00:28:21,339
-How you doing?
-Hello.

473
00:28:21,441 --> 00:28:23,035
Uncle Willie Earl.

474
00:28:25,154 --> 00:28:26,586
Rich and fine.

475
00:28:27,681 --> 00:28:29,145
Fine as a glass of wine.

476
00:28:29,251 --> 00:28:30,680
And my cousin, Malcolm.

477
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:33,825
I invited the two of them to stay here.
I hope that's okay.

478
00:28:36,612 --> 00:28:38,334
Mom.

479
00:28:38,402 --> 00:28:41,019
Yes, yes.
I mean, we certainly have enough room.

480
00:28:41,191 --> 00:28:43,805
Why don't we go into the house,
make you more comfortable.

481
00:28:44,096 --> 00:28:46,041
You guys have to be so thirsty.

482
00:28:46,115 --> 00:28:48,059
We have Bellinis.
I hope you like Bellinis.

483
00:28:48,132 --> 00:28:50,106
-Bellinis. What the hell is that?
-Yes, yes.

484
00:28:50,177 --> 00:28:51,196
It is so good.

485
00:28:52,515 --> 00:28:54,305
I want some Coca-Cola...

486
00:28:55,269 --> 00:28:57,822
-Come on in, everyone.
-Thank you.

487
00:28:57,893 --> 00:28:59,170
Bellini for you, Mom.

488
00:28:59,268 --> 00:29:00,696
-No, no, no, no.
-No? You sure?

489
00:29:01,765 --> 00:29:04,831
Everyone, come on into the living room.

490
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,670
William Earl, Michael?

491
00:29:08,738 --> 00:29:12,127
-Malcolm.
-Malcolm. Pardon me, Malcolm.

492
00:29:12,198 --> 00:29:14,466
Please, have a seat.
Make yourself comfortable.

493
00:29:15,042 --> 00:29:16,866
-Welcome, welcome.
-Is this...

494
00:29:18,503 --> 00:29:21,535
I made Jason a sweet potato pie.
It's his favorite.

495
00:29:21,605 --> 00:29:23,232
Well, what a lovely gift.

496
00:29:23,301 --> 00:29:25,891
Yeah, no, she's famous all over
Brooklyn for her pies.

497
00:29:25,958 --> 00:29:28,165
Really? We'll have to serve it tonight
at the rehearsal dinner.

498
00:29:28,233 --> 00:29:30,654
No, no, no.
This is for Jason and his friends.

499
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:33,891
It's just that my buddies always fight
over her pies.

500
00:29:33,959 --> 00:29:35,551
She's a really, really good cook.

501
00:29:35,621 --> 00:29:38,885
Well, Mrs. Taylor, you really need
to share your recipes with me.

502
00:29:38,952 --> 00:29:40,644
Hear a way to a man's heart
is through his stomach.

503
00:29:41,574 --> 00:29:43,298
It's a family secret.

504
00:29:44,489 --> 00:29:45,630
Well...

505
00:29:46,152 --> 00:29:49,026
It's a good thing we're all
gonna be family after tomorrow.

506
00:29:50,857 --> 00:29:52,198
Where can I put this?

507
00:29:52,265 --> 00:29:53,313
You can shove it...

508
00:29:53,384 --> 00:29:55,296
-In the kitchen.
-Thank you, Mabel.

509
00:29:55,849 --> 00:29:57,473
Hello! Hello.

510
00:29:57,926 --> 00:29:59,592
-Dad!
-Gregg Watson.

511
00:30:00,005 --> 00:30:02,554
You must be Jason's sister.

512
00:30:03,465 --> 00:30:05,322
No. I'm his mother.

513
00:30:08,745 --> 00:30:11,562
Jason, why have you
kept this jewel hidden from us?

514
00:30:11,626 --> 00:30:13,415
-My apologies.
-Thank you.

515
00:30:13,482 --> 00:30:15,817
We are so sorry you couldn't make it
to lunch with us last month.

516
00:30:16,938 --> 00:30:18,660
You all went to lunch together?

517
00:30:19,307 --> 00:30:21,192
-Where?
-21 .

518
00:30:21,515 --> 00:30:23,270
-21 .
-It was phenomenal.

519
00:30:23,338 --> 00:30:25,060
Well, Jason told us that you were busy.

520
00:30:25,351 --> 00:30:26,370
Busy?

521
00:30:26,444 --> 00:30:28,646
It was really last-minute, Mom.

522
00:30:34,636 --> 00:30:39,555
Well, Mrs. Taylor, allow me to show you
and Shondra to your living quarters.

523
00:30:39,722 --> 00:30:41,281
This way, please.

524
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,524
It's Shonda.

525
00:30:50,025 --> 00:30:52,396
21? Strike two.

526
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:53,863
Here we go.

527
00:30:54,256 --> 00:30:56,772
"It's a family secret"? What was that?

528
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:59,746
If I can't have your cookies,
you can't have my pies.

529
00:30:59,849 --> 00:31:02,637
Hello! Maid of honor in the house!

530
00:31:02,703 --> 00:31:04,743
Blythe! Oh, my goodness!

531
00:31:05,678 --> 00:31:07,053
Look at you, you look so good.

532
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:10,532
You are just in time to counsel the
bride with a mother-in-law situation.

533
00:31:11,184 --> 00:31:12,844
Well, as long as you pay me in Moët.

534
00:31:13,009 --> 00:31:14,597
-Done. Come on.
-Let's do it.

535
00:31:14,698 --> 00:31:15,750
Excuse me.

536
00:31:16,621 --> 00:31:19,113
How you doing? I'm Malcolm. And you are?

537
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:21,222
-Blythe.
-Blythe, Blythe, Blythe.

538
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:22,441
So, I hear you the maid of honor.

539
00:31:23,407 --> 00:31:24,516
Well, I'm the best man,

540
00:31:24,592 --> 00:31:26,215
so there's gotta be some kind of ritual
we can do

541
00:31:26,286 --> 00:31:28,111
to get to know each other better.

542
00:31:29,296 --> 00:31:33,122
There is. There is.
It's called stop touching me.

543
00:31:35,055 --> 00:31:37,741
-Okay.
-Bellini, lovely.

544
00:31:38,576 --> 00:31:39,657
Bellini?

545
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:41,221
Now, that's that boomerang game,
brother.

546
00:31:41,295 --> 00:31:42,475
-She gonna come back.
-Okay.

547
00:31:47,121 --> 00:31:50,439
No, I mean, I feel so fresh.

548
00:31:50,674 --> 00:31:52,465
You didn't use that thing, did you?

549
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:53,992
You know I did.

550
00:31:54,673 --> 00:31:56,018
And you know what I realize?

551
00:31:56,085 --> 00:31:58,541
That rich people are not happy
because of the money.

552
00:31:58,613 --> 00:32:00,466
They're happy because of the bidets.

553
00:32:00,531 --> 00:32:02,538
The bidets make you wanna go out
and make more money

554
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:04,617
-so you could buy some more bidets.
-Listen,

555
00:32:04,916 --> 00:32:07,302
they have those bidets
because they're full of it.

556
00:32:07,378 --> 00:32:09,288
What, you brought a broom?

557
00:32:09,361 --> 00:32:11,502
Honey, this isn't just any broom.

558
00:32:11,572 --> 00:32:14,475
This is the broom that Mike
and I jumped when we got married.

559
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:17,459
You know, I don't know
why I feel like a bald-headed stepchild

560
00:32:17,555 --> 00:32:19,408
at my own son's wedding.

561
00:32:19,475 --> 00:32:20,787
And all that talk about
they didn't have time

562
00:32:20,853 --> 00:32:23,635
for her to come across the bridge
and meet me is just a lie.

563
00:32:23,701 --> 00:32:25,838
Then they gonna go to 21 without me.

564
00:32:26,775 --> 00:32:28,461
Yeah, Jason, he should've told you.

565
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:31,828
There's no reason why they should've
had that party without you or me.

566
00:32:31,926 --> 00:32:34,292
It wasn't Jason.
He'd never do that to me.

567
00:32:34,356 --> 00:32:36,942
It was that little ugly girl
in that teeny tiny dress.

568
00:32:37,204 --> 00:32:39,626
-Oh, my God!
-What is it?

569
00:32:39,701 --> 00:32:43,445
Rich folks got good taste in property,
but bad taste in snacks.

570
00:32:43,702 --> 00:32:44,847
Knock, knock!

571
00:32:48,373 --> 00:32:49,584
-Hi.
-Hi.

572
00:32:50,261 --> 00:32:51,671
I hope everything's okay with the room.

573
00:32:54,647 --> 00:32:56,815
So, I just...
I wanted to make sure we're all set

574
00:32:56,884 --> 00:32:58,317
for the fitting tomorrow morning.

575
00:32:58,805 --> 00:33:00,467
-Fitting?
-Yeah, Jason didn't tell you?

576
00:33:01,752 --> 00:33:02,830
He's such a man.

577
00:33:03,382 --> 00:33:05,291
I bought you two dresses to choose from.

578
00:33:05,556 --> 00:33:07,249
-For?
-The wedding.

579
00:33:08,727 --> 00:33:11,182
Honey, no. I dress myself. Thank you.

580
00:33:11,254 --> 00:33:12,535
I know,

581
00:33:12,602 --> 00:33:15,119
but, you see, I wanted everyone
to wear the same shade of buff tomorrow,

582
00:33:15,192 --> 00:33:16,242
for the optics.

583
00:33:16,314 --> 00:33:17,489
Optics?

584
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,575
The photographs.

585
00:33:18,647 --> 00:33:22,426
You mean pictures? Well, then just
say pictures. Say pictures.

586
00:33:23,383 --> 00:33:25,716
-Pictures.
-Well, if you had mentioned a dress

587
00:33:25,785 --> 00:33:28,206
in that lovely text message
you sent yesterday,

588
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,417
then I would not have gone out
and bought this one.

589
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:32,823
I mean, this got buff.

590
00:33:33,497 --> 00:33:35,602
Buff, that's white, right?
White is buff?

591
00:33:35,672 --> 00:33:38,040
-See? Lot of white in this.
-Yeah, kind of, but...

592
00:33:38,551 --> 00:33:39,893
It's just...

593
00:33:40,182 --> 00:33:42,702
Would you mind wearing one
of the dresses?

594
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:46,036
I'll have my father reimburse you.
You don't mind, do you?

595
00:33:46,104 --> 00:33:48,113
It's just, it's my wedding,
and I was hoping that...

596
00:33:48,186 --> 00:33:49,430
Okay, okay, I'll wear your dress.

597
00:33:49,502 --> 00:33:50,546
Really?

598
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:51,795
Thank you!

599
00:33:55,322 --> 00:33:56,499
I was...

600
00:33:57,946 --> 00:33:59,379
Sorry. Just...

601
00:34:00,028 --> 00:34:01,685
Okay. Well...

602
00:34:01,982 --> 00:34:03,092
I hope you enjoy the box.

603
00:34:03,517 --> 00:34:05,009
My mom made it special.

604
00:34:06,333 --> 00:34:08,340
I'll see you at the rehearsal dinner.

605
00:34:08,445 --> 00:34:11,612
And I really think you're gonna love
either one of the dresses.

606
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:17,461
Buff usually looks good on everyone.
Just as a general rule of thumb, so...

607
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:19,632
Okay.

608
00:34:20,924 --> 00:34:23,128
Girl, I'm really proud of you.

609
00:34:23,194 --> 00:34:26,393
I mean, really, that anger management
class must've really paid off.

610
00:34:26,459 --> 00:34:28,414
That is strike three.

611
00:34:28,828 --> 00:34:32,694
Who shows up with extra weekend guests?
It's just so...

612
00:34:32,768 --> 00:34:33,712
Ghetto?

613
00:34:34,367 --> 00:34:36,056
I was gonna say simple.

614
00:34:36,124 --> 00:34:39,291
Mère Claudine would have put them back
on the ferry

615
00:34:39,358 --> 00:34:41,776
faster than they could say
"sweet potato pie."

616
00:34:42,465 --> 00:34:45,017
She nearly banned Gregory's parents
from our wedding.

617
00:34:45,121 --> 00:34:47,159
They never acted up again.

618
00:34:48,095 --> 00:34:50,167
I wish I could say the same
for their son.

619
00:34:50,238 --> 00:34:51,645
There's nothing wrong with Gregory.

620
00:34:52,801 --> 00:34:54,740
He invited his mistress to the wedding.

621
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:56,600
You don't know that to be true.

622
00:34:56,668 --> 00:35:00,696
Mabel, I'm not a fool.
The signs have been there for a while.

623
00:35:05,504 --> 00:35:08,763
Well, that Mrs. Taylor may be backwards,
but she sure can make a pie.

624
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:11,198
Mrs. Watson? There you are.

625
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,506
Hey. Hi, Mabel.

626
00:35:13,667 --> 00:35:15,839
-Oh, Lord.
-So, I told Chef about our extra guests,

627
00:35:15,907 --> 00:35:17,332
and he said, "There's no more chicken."

628
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:19,263
So, I suggested he serve salmon.

629
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:23,387
Well, he said they seem
like chicken people to him.

630
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:25,117
And I thought that sounded
a little bit offensive,

631
00:35:25,186 --> 00:35:26,298
but given the history of our country,

632
00:35:26,371 --> 00:35:28,705
I didn't think I was the one
who should point that out.

633
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:31,069
I really need him on my side
to pull this whole thing off.

634
00:35:31,458 --> 00:35:32,669
So, anyway, bottom line,

635
00:35:33,057 --> 00:35:34,301
he refuses to make any new chicken

636
00:35:34,373 --> 00:35:38,365
because he's already seasoned
the RSVP'd chicken, so, you know, help.

637
00:35:38,435 --> 00:35:39,577
Thanks.

638
00:35:44,102 --> 00:35:46,402
Hoods are good for a roll in the hay,
but you don't marry them.

639
00:35:46,466 --> 00:35:50,724
I do agree with you,
but Jason has become a bootstrapper.

640
00:35:50,788 --> 00:35:52,349
Hoods, bootstrappers, same thing.

641
00:35:52,644 --> 00:35:53,920
I know, right?

642
00:35:53,987 --> 00:35:55,416
Then the ushers take the mother
of the bride

643
00:35:55,491 --> 00:35:58,493
and mother of the groom to their seats
on opposite sides of the aisle.

644
00:35:58,565 --> 00:36:00,449
Dude, they're looking at me, ain't they?

645
00:36:00,514 --> 00:36:02,305
Yeah, they're looking.

646
00:36:03,397 --> 00:36:05,287
I ain't marrying nothing.

647
00:36:05,925 --> 00:36:08,224
Talkin' about some China. Right.

648
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:11,396
I bet you good money that girl pregnant.

649
00:36:11,464 --> 00:36:14,273
That's the only reason Jason would be
getting married this quick, bro.

650
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:16,413
No, I don't believe she's pregnant.

651
00:36:16,485 --> 00:36:19,421
And I don't think Jason would
appreciate you spreading that rumor.

652
00:36:19,494 --> 00:36:21,406
I ain't spreading a rumor,
I'm talking to you.

653
00:36:21,479 --> 00:36:24,445
Okay, well,
maybe you should be talking to Jason.

654
00:36:24,518 --> 00:36:27,103
What is that, that's your role here,
the rumor police?

655
00:36:27,172 --> 00:36:30,435
No, I am a colleague.
Goldman Sachs, maybe you heard of it?

656
00:36:30,504 --> 00:36:33,218
-No. -And the best man
takes his place right here.

657
00:36:33,285 --> 00:36:35,192
Ricky, please.

658
00:36:35,267 --> 00:36:36,416
-Wait, wait.
-Right this way.

659
00:36:36,487 --> 00:36:38,242
-You the best man?
-Yeah.

660
00:36:38,311 --> 00:36:40,646
Ricky, if I could get you up here.

661
00:36:41,412 --> 00:36:44,830
-Hey, your cousin's hilarious.
-What's he up to now?

662
00:36:44,901 --> 00:36:48,388
I don't know, he seems really interested
in you and Sabrina's love life.

663
00:36:48,459 --> 00:36:49,886
Well, that makes two of us.

664
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,584
But in 23 more hours, guess what?

665
00:36:51,656 --> 00:36:54,045
-I will be good to go.
-Okay.

666
00:36:54,121 --> 00:36:56,968
How long have they been dating,
like, six months, right?

667
00:36:57,031 --> 00:36:59,519
I guess they think it's romantic.

668
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:01,829
Well, I don't know. He might be
getting it from somewhere else

669
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:04,773
'cause the only guy I know
wait six months to have sex

670
00:37:04,873 --> 00:37:07,591
is either on the low-down
or the down-low.

671
00:37:07,658 --> 00:37:08,868
True.

672
00:37:08,938 --> 00:37:09,917
I want you to be honest with me.

673
00:37:09,993 --> 00:37:11,749
I'm gonna ask you something.
I wanna know right now.

674
00:37:11,817 --> 00:37:13,761
-God, here we go.
-'Cause I know you, all right?

675
00:37:13,833 --> 00:37:15,208
How are you doing this?

676
00:37:15,272 --> 00:37:19,205
Let's see.
Lot of baby oil, medicated Vaseline.

677
00:37:19,277 --> 00:37:21,249
-They have this new stuff...
-Okay, pause.

678
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:24,071
You asked. Let's just say
I've been handling the situation.

679
00:37:24,138 --> 00:37:25,927
Yeah, apparently, for six months.

680
00:37:25,996 --> 00:37:30,248
Yeah, six months. And guess what?
For Sabrina, I'd go another six months.

681
00:37:30,887 --> 00:37:33,281
Just don't tell her I said that,
'cause I don't wanna give her any ideas.

682
00:37:33,356 --> 00:37:37,765
I mean, seriously, like, what kind
of man waits that long to have sex?

683
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:39,975
The kind of man
I'm about to marry tomorrow.

684
00:37:40,043 --> 00:37:43,688
And stop talking about me
and worry about your own sad situation.

685
00:37:43,756 --> 00:37:44,614
Where'd this come from?

686
00:37:44,907 --> 00:37:47,203
The married one, or the
investment banker or the footballer?

687
00:37:47,275 --> 00:37:48,901
-I can't keep up with you, Blythe.
-All of them.

688
00:37:48,971 --> 00:37:51,492
Well, excuse me,
Miss "I-made-a-deal-with-God."

689
00:37:51,566 --> 00:37:53,473
Just remember that I knew you when.

690
00:37:53,579 --> 00:37:55,432
Yes, and you are going to be quiet
about that.

691
00:37:55,497 --> 00:37:56,996
I am not talking about that
this weekend.

692
00:37:57,067 --> 00:37:58,529
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

693
00:37:58,603 --> 00:37:59,982
-You do you and I'll do me.
-Fine.

694
00:38:00,048 --> 00:38:03,459
On that note, I'm gonna go get
another glass of champagne. This one.

695
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:06,567
-Blythe!
-Darling, your secrets are safe with me.

696
00:38:06,637 --> 00:38:08,811
I don't understand this obsession
with chicken.

697
00:38:12,591 --> 00:38:15,557
Come on, people,
put some pep in your step.

698
00:38:16,204 --> 00:38:18,093
Let's go, people.
They're getting hungry outside.

699
00:38:19,438 --> 00:38:21,957
And if these are not going out,
put 'em on ice, please.

700
00:38:22,095 --> 00:38:23,502
Getting hot out there.

701
00:38:23,597 --> 00:38:24,616
Pardon me.

702
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:25,931
-Excuse me.
-Excuse me.

703
00:38:25,998 --> 00:38:28,518
-Excuse me.
-Watch the stove. It's hot.

704
00:38:30,447 --> 00:38:31,430
Blythe.

705
00:38:32,847 --> 00:38:33,928
Chef.

706
00:38:35,535 --> 00:38:36,946
Excuse me.

707
00:39:01,843 --> 00:39:03,267
We need to talk.

708
00:39:03,343 --> 00:39:05,386
Could you pick a worse time?

709
00:39:06,673 --> 00:39:09,453
You've always been great
at recognizing a moment.

710
00:39:09,874 --> 00:39:11,532
Our guests are about to arrive.

711
00:39:16,373 --> 00:39:18,891
Sarcasm is something
your family always used

712
00:39:18,962 --> 00:39:21,611
to keep from actually
talking to each other.

713
00:39:23,124 --> 00:39:24,499
I'm getting pretty tired of it.

714
00:39:43,954 --> 00:39:46,573
You shouldn't be out here
cleaning in this hot sun.

715
00:39:46,678 --> 00:39:50,121
-Don't you worry, Miss. I'm okay.
-Is sunscreen something you would use?

716
00:39:50,194 --> 00:39:51,148
-No.
-No.

717
00:39:54,325 --> 00:39:56,232
So, is that Jason's crew?

718
00:39:58,579 --> 00:39:59,925
Slim pickings, right?

719
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:03,664
Ricky's kind of cute, but what's up
with the pressed khakis and Top-Siders?

720
00:40:05,207 --> 00:40:08,715
Analysis. He bought those clothes
to impress and look the part,

721
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:11,860
hoping that he would rub elbows
and maybe come up like Jason.

722
00:40:12,215 --> 00:40:14,517
Don't talk about my boo like that.

723
00:40:14,837 --> 00:40:17,042
You know, if you'd stop dating
from that crazy list of yours,

724
00:40:17,109 --> 00:40:19,184
you might actually find a decent man.

725
00:40:19,254 --> 00:40:20,432
I don't have a list.

726
00:40:20,504 --> 00:40:22,164
You don't have a list?

727
00:40:22,232 --> 00:40:23,407
I don't!

728
00:40:23,992 --> 00:40:28,727
Okay, let's see, lvy League,
not by scholarship. Seven-figure salary.

729
00:40:28,824 --> 00:40:30,865
Black Card, seasoned at least one year.

730
00:40:30,936 --> 00:40:33,388
Laughs at all your jokes
and loves your mama.

731
00:40:33,466 --> 00:40:35,352
Need I say more?

732
00:40:35,416 --> 00:40:37,588
But what are you guys saying,
that I should lower my standards?

733
00:40:37,656 --> 00:40:38,705
-Yeah.
-Yes!

734
00:40:38,778 --> 00:40:40,665
-What?
-Because it's based in fantasy.

735
00:40:40,762 --> 00:40:43,510
You gotta look through different eyes.
Open your mind to other possibilities.

736
00:40:44,215 --> 00:40:45,395
Ladies, hey.

737
00:40:46,364 --> 00:40:49,461
Sorry for ear-hustling over there,
but I agree with her.

738
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:51,633
You should open your eyes
to different possibilities.

739
00:40:52,026 --> 00:40:53,968
See? No lvy League.

740
00:40:54,487 --> 00:40:57,653
Seven figures? Not at all. Close
to five some years when I'm working.

741
00:40:57,722 --> 00:41:00,919
But I get you, Blythe.
We should hook up.

742
00:41:01,438 --> 00:41:03,605
-You and me.
-I'm a hermaphrodite.

743
00:41:04,926 --> 00:41:06,514
I don't care what your religion is.

744
00:41:07,258 --> 00:41:08,566
-It's more about us.
-Wow!

745
00:41:09,212 --> 00:41:10,385
It's nature.

746
00:41:10,747 --> 00:41:12,469
Listen, baby, this is the
perfect weekend, right? There's...

747
00:41:12,539 --> 00:41:13,753
-Ladies?
-Thank you.

748
00:41:13,981 --> 00:41:17,365
Caviar is very fresh. You should try it.
Blythe, right?

749
00:41:18,522 --> 00:41:19,570
Yeah.

750
00:41:19,997 --> 00:41:21,851
I have something I want you to try.

751
00:41:24,444 --> 00:41:25,427
Why don't you come with me?

752
00:41:25,788 --> 00:41:26,933
Okay.

753
00:41:28,124 --> 00:41:29,107
Excuse me.

754
00:41:33,085 --> 00:41:34,904
What, what... What just happened?

755
00:41:35,872 --> 00:41:38,553
-Thanks for rescuing me.
-My pleasure.

756
00:41:41,342 --> 00:41:42,836
Thank you, sir.

757
00:41:45,919 --> 00:41:46,932
I'm sorry.

758
00:41:49,053 --> 00:41:50,482
I'm Sebastian.

759
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:52,504
I'm Shonda.

760
00:41:52,862 --> 00:41:54,805
So, I'm guessing
you're a friend of the groom?

761
00:41:56,607 --> 00:41:58,365
I'm his mama's best friend.

762
00:41:59,707 --> 00:42:01,532
I'm the bride's cousin.

763
00:42:04,095 --> 00:42:05,076
How old are you?

764
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:07,513
I'll be a senior next year at Yale.

765
00:42:09,313 --> 00:42:11,960
Cheers. Okay, take care.

766
00:42:19,299 --> 00:42:20,505
Try this.

767
00:42:23,297 --> 00:42:24,308
No.

768
00:42:36,032 --> 00:42:39,162
You feel that tingle of the champagne
on your lips?

769
00:42:39,778 --> 00:42:43,421
And the smooth and gentle texture
of the body between your teeth?

770
00:42:44,993 --> 00:42:50,429
And, finally, the explosive finish
on your tongue?

771
00:43:19,204 --> 00:43:22,301
-You know, the shrimp are cold.
-They're supposed to be that way, Mom.

772
00:43:22,370 --> 00:43:25,438
I'm not having any of this food.
I'm hungry.

773
00:43:26,181 --> 00:43:28,004
Who in our family eats oysters?

774
00:43:28,101 --> 00:43:30,718
And when did you start eating oysters?

775
00:43:30,790 --> 00:43:34,562
God, I mean, you love my cooking.
Why didn't you just run the menu by me?

776
00:43:34,627 --> 00:43:36,935
Because all I did was write the check,
Mom.

777
00:43:37,127 --> 00:43:40,289
These folk have all the money in the
world and they got you paying for this?

778
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:42,757
-Mom, look at this.
-No, you look at this.

779
00:43:42,822 --> 00:43:44,543
Now, this is not you.

780
00:43:45,355 --> 00:43:47,555
I know you. You love greens.

781
00:43:47,623 --> 00:43:49,315
You will not eat a meal without greens,

782
00:43:49,385 --> 00:43:52,036
-and I don't see a green anywhere.
-Mom? Mom.

783
00:43:52,104 --> 00:43:54,177
I'll have the chef makes us
our own pot of greens.

784
00:43:55,270 --> 00:43:56,416
With neck bones.

785
00:43:56,486 --> 00:43:57,603
That stanky chef don't know nothing

786
00:43:57,675 --> 00:43:59,166
-about no neck bones.
-Turkey neck bones,

787
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:02,080
-just like you make 'em.
-Well. Yes, okay.

788
00:44:04,458 --> 00:44:08,070
Now, this pool is nothing. I have
a friend who's got a big, big pool.

789
00:44:08,138 --> 00:44:09,863
-It goes way up...
-Mom, come on.

790
00:44:09,931 --> 00:44:11,113
It's true.

791
00:44:18,764 --> 00:44:21,795
Hey, everybody, if I could just
get your attention for a second.

792
00:44:21,865 --> 00:44:26,886
I wanted to take a moment
to welcome you all to our home

793
00:44:26,953 --> 00:44:32,104
and to thank you for sharing
this special occasion with us.

794
00:44:32,168 --> 00:44:35,967
Good friends and family,

795
00:44:36,264 --> 00:44:40,778
we appreciate how hard it was
to come here without much notice.

796
00:44:40,847 --> 00:44:42,699
For that, you can thank Sabrina.

797
00:44:43,501 --> 00:44:44,994
-Yes.
-Baby girl,

798
00:44:45,069 --> 00:44:48,709
she is impulsive and spontaneous.

799
00:44:49,227 --> 00:44:53,800
She's got a good mind and a huge heart.

800
00:44:59,216 --> 00:45:00,521
And I love her.

801
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:02,115
Thank you, Dad.

802
00:45:02,349 --> 00:45:06,539
And now Jason's uncle, Willie Earl,
will be giving the blessing.

803
00:45:06,796 --> 00:45:09,163
-Willie Earl. Willie Earl.
-What's happening, Pam?

804
00:45:12,046 --> 00:45:12,994
Okay.

805
00:45:13,645 --> 00:45:17,090
Heavenly Father, dear Lord,
thank you for these gifts.

806
00:45:17,168 --> 00:45:19,075
And thank you for being merciful,

807
00:45:19,148 --> 00:45:22,860
even to those
who do not appreciate your generosity.

808
00:45:24,208 --> 00:45:27,076
Dear Lord,
they're sitting in their expensive cars,

809
00:45:27,151 --> 00:45:29,060
Lord, and they wear their fancy clothes,

810
00:45:29,134 --> 00:45:31,621
and they think
that they alone are responsible

811
00:45:31,692 --> 00:45:32,745
for everything they have.

812
00:45:32,816 --> 00:45:34,952
-But, Lord, we know the truth, don't we?
-This is not a blessing.

813
00:45:35,023 --> 00:45:36,303
-Hey, baby, just breathe.
-We know that the meek...

814
00:45:36,977 --> 00:45:40,236
The meek shall inherit the Earth.
Thank you, Jesus.

815
00:45:40,497 --> 00:45:44,136
Hallelujah! Amen! Bon appetit.

816
00:45:46,381 --> 00:45:48,624
-What was that? What was that?
-Just breathe.

817
00:45:48,692 --> 00:45:50,599
Your mother said
that I could give the blessing.

818
00:45:50,673 --> 00:45:52,492
Well, if that was a blessing,
you going to hell.

819
00:45:52,559 --> 00:45:53,899
That was completely inappropriate.

820
00:45:53,966 --> 00:45:57,234
I'm inappropriate?
Where are my people? Where is my family?

821
00:45:57,362 --> 00:45:59,117
Well, aren't we all gonna be family
after tomorrow?

822
00:45:59,216 --> 00:46:01,075
That's right. After tomorrow, it's on.

823
00:46:01,139 --> 00:46:04,236
We're already all one big family, right?

824
00:46:04,306 --> 00:46:06,510
-Baby, let it go. -Yes, and this food
is really hitting the spot.

825
00:46:06,579 --> 00:46:09,842
I'll have to work it off tomorrow
with the Electric Slide. Let's have fun.

826
00:46:09,939 --> 00:46:13,649
To the left, to the left,
to the right, to the right.

827
00:46:13,714 --> 00:46:17,904
Actually, Jason and I told the DJ
not to encourage the slide, you know,

828
00:46:17,969 --> 00:46:18,985
so I don't want you
to look forward to that.

829
00:46:19,059 --> 00:46:22,224
Y'all don't do the Electric Slide? What
y'all do, the Riverdance or something?

830
00:46:22,292 --> 00:46:25,970
No, Willie Earl. It's just so cliche,
you know.

831
00:46:26,035 --> 00:46:28,307
They do it at the end
of every black wedding, and we just...

832
00:46:28,372 --> 00:46:31,084
Well, it figures
that your kind would think that way.

833
00:46:31,156 --> 00:46:32,910
-Mom.
-Here we go.

834
00:46:32,979 --> 00:46:34,091
"Your kind?"

835
00:46:34,162 --> 00:46:38,671
I'm sorry, I didn't realize that the
Electric Slide was a cultural necessity.

836
00:46:38,739 --> 00:46:42,417
Well, the Electric Slide at a black
wedding is just like jumping the broom.

837
00:46:42,485 --> 00:46:44,242
-Yeah, right.
-You're gonna jump the broom?

838
00:46:44,311 --> 00:46:45,356
No.

839
00:46:45,428 --> 00:46:46,544
-What?
-Namaste.

840
00:46:46,614 --> 00:46:48,685
Remember anger management, okay?
Just calm down.

841
00:46:48,756 --> 00:46:50,928
Jason, enough is enough.
You've got to jump the broom.

842
00:46:51,093 --> 00:46:52,337
-Mom, we just...
-Mrs. Taylor,

843
00:46:52,437 --> 00:46:56,367
Jason and I decided we wanted
everything to be simple, elegant.

844
00:46:59,000 --> 00:46:59,977
Modern.

845
00:47:00,052 --> 00:47:03,501
Would a Jewish couple get married
without breaking the glass?

846
00:47:03,669 --> 00:47:04,652
We're not Jewish.

847
00:47:04,726 --> 00:47:05,936
I didn't say you were Jewish.

848
00:47:06,967 --> 00:47:08,858
The slaves were not allowed to marry.

849
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:12,267
Jumping the broom was the only way
that they could show their union.

850
00:47:12,341 --> 00:47:14,963
Now, we have done that in this family
for years.

851
00:47:15,034 --> 00:47:17,684
It is a tradition.
It's gone on for generations.

852
00:47:17,752 --> 00:47:21,745
And, as you say,
it is a cultural necessity.

853
00:47:22,423 --> 00:47:25,491
Look, Harriet Tubman,
Kunta Kinte ain't sitting at the table,

854
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:27,949
and, you know,
this ain't a black history moment, Pam.

855
00:47:28,343 --> 00:47:31,282
Well, why should they have to jump
over a broom?

856
00:47:31,353 --> 00:47:32,495
My family weren't slaves.

857
00:47:32,596 --> 00:47:33,909
Are you so sure of that?

858
00:47:33,975 --> 00:47:36,312
Yes. As a matter of fact,
they owned slaves.

859
00:47:36,409 --> 00:47:37,425
What?

860
00:47:37,498 --> 00:47:38,543
Mom, don't say that.

861
00:47:39,708 --> 00:47:41,458
And you're proud of that?

862
00:47:41,562 --> 00:47:44,973
No, no, I'm neither proud nor ashamed.
It's just an immutable fact.

863
00:47:45,273 --> 00:47:48,537
You know something,
you're crazier than I thought you were.

864
00:47:48,602 --> 00:47:51,448
Here's another fact, honey.
You need to get off your high horse

865
00:47:51,514 --> 00:47:53,746
and come on back down to Earth,
'cause, baby, you black.

866
00:47:53,815 --> 00:47:55,062
-That's right.
-Okay? You're black.

867
00:47:55,674 --> 00:47:57,615
-You black.
-No, you don't come into my house

868
00:47:57,690 --> 00:48:00,211
and tell me what I'm supposed to do.

869
00:48:00,538 --> 00:48:03,382
I'm about to have this woman dragged
out of my house.

870
00:48:03,479 --> 00:48:06,932
No, they're not trying to voulez-vous
coucher avec moi ce soir us.

871
00:48:07,036 --> 00:48:10,231
I don't care what they saying in French.
I know she talking about me.

872
00:48:10,334 --> 00:48:11,541
Hey, come on, Pam.

873
00:48:11,609 --> 00:48:13,619
Mrs. Taylor, it's just that...

874
00:48:13,786 --> 00:48:15,215
Did you just kick me
under the table twice?

875
00:48:15,323 --> 00:48:16,950
Not in a row, baby. Just relax.

876
00:48:17,053 --> 00:48:20,367
Listen, everybody, calm down.
Calm down, calm down, all right?

877
00:48:20,957 --> 00:48:26,104
Now, listen, if it is important
to Jason's family to jump the broom,

878
00:48:26,171 --> 00:48:30,642
would it be so difficult
to actually consider jumping the broom?

879
00:48:30,972 --> 00:48:32,629
-There.
-Thank you.

880
00:48:33,916 --> 00:48:38,107
Go play with your whore over there.

881
00:48:38,973 --> 00:48:41,560
She said she gonna hit you in the head
with a computer, I heard that.

882
00:48:42,684 --> 00:48:44,856
Good evening, good evening,
good evening.

883
00:48:44,924 --> 00:48:46,867
You look awesome this evening.

884
00:48:47,197 --> 00:48:48,538
My baby, hi!

885
00:48:48,604 --> 00:48:49,951
Can I... Yes.

886
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:51,735
Like we rehearsed.

887
00:48:53,054 --> 00:48:54,364
That's a short dress.

888
00:48:54,653 --> 00:48:57,021
I'd like to sing a song

889
00:48:57,085 --> 00:49:00,088
for Sabrina and Jason's big day.

890
00:49:01,791 --> 00:49:07,092
I heard it's been a long,
long six months.

891
00:49:08,191 --> 00:49:11,901
I don't know how you two do it.
Wow. I know I couldn't do it.

892
00:49:15,231 --> 00:49:17,086
Get up, get up, get up, get up

893
00:49:19,933 --> 00:49:22,008
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up

894
00:49:22,110 --> 00:49:23,322
This is gonna be interesting.

895
00:49:23,741 --> 00:49:26,912
Oh, baby, let's get down tonight

896
00:49:31,425 --> 00:49:35,287
Ooh, baby

897
00:49:35,392 --> 00:49:38,391
I'm hot just like an oven

898
00:49:38,461 --> 00:49:39,742
I need some loving

899
00:49:39,809 --> 00:49:41,185
No, she didn't say that.

900
00:49:41,251 --> 00:49:43,639
And, baby

901
00:49:43,715 --> 00:49:46,082
Any chance you might be able to get
that dress after she's done with it?

902
00:49:46,147 --> 00:49:48,088
I can't hold on much longer

903
00:49:48,161 --> 00:49:51,132
It's getting stronger and stronger

904
00:49:51,203 --> 00:49:53,505
And when I get that feeling

905
00:49:53,570 --> 00:49:55,905
I want sexual healing

906
00:49:56,195 --> 00:49:59,613
Sexual healing

907
00:50:00,194 --> 00:50:01,540
Oh, baby

908
00:50:01,606 --> 00:50:04,638
Make me feel so fine

909
00:50:06,435 --> 00:50:10,083
Help to relieve my mind

910
00:50:11,204 --> 00:50:15,962
Sexual healing, baby, is good for me

911
00:50:16,037 --> 00:50:21,121
Sexual healing is something
that's good for me

912
00:50:21,188 --> 00:50:25,376
If you don't know
the things that you're dealing

913
00:50:25,477 --> 00:50:30,813
Jason and Sabrina,
get some sexual healing

914
00:50:41,254 --> 00:50:43,458
I got her sexual healing right here.

915
00:50:43,526 --> 00:50:46,974
Hell, she gonna be
the next ex-Miss Willie Taylor.

916
00:50:53,418 --> 00:50:56,318
I thought you would at least look
after me once I got here.

917
00:50:56,391 --> 00:50:57,669
How could you let those people
treat me like that?

918
00:50:57,737 --> 00:51:00,355
Mom, there is blame to be
had on both sides.

919
00:51:00,422 --> 00:51:02,048
Now, will you please
just give these people a break?

920
00:51:02,119 --> 00:51:03,551
-Give these people a break?
-Yes.

921
00:51:03,625 --> 00:51:06,852
-Her family had slaves and she's proud
of it? -That's not what she said.

922
00:51:06,950 --> 00:51:09,735
Now there's something wrong
with my hearing. I know what she said.

923
00:51:09,801 --> 00:51:12,256
And you know what, you're gonna end up
being her slave for life.

924
00:51:12,328 --> 00:51:13,508
So, now I'm a slave?

925
00:51:13,611 --> 00:51:15,368
Boy, don't you get dramatic with me.

926
00:51:16,872 --> 00:51:18,848
Mom, I have a bachelor party to go to,
all right?

927
00:51:18,953 --> 00:51:19,937
Go.

928
00:51:31,788 --> 00:51:33,379
Hey, Willie Earl.

929
00:51:34,634 --> 00:51:36,161
You on one tonight, ain't you, sis?

930
00:51:37,770 --> 00:51:38,786
That was wrong.

931
00:51:40,077 --> 00:51:41,155
And what'd you say that speech for?

932
00:51:41,226 --> 00:51:43,714
It's "why did you give that speech."

933
00:51:43,786 --> 00:51:46,602
You're out here
with all these bougie folk.

934
00:51:46,669 --> 00:51:48,294
You better not be using that Ebonics.

935
00:51:48,365 --> 00:51:50,308
No, I'm serious, Pam.

936
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:51,875
That was wrong and it was foul

937
00:51:52,267 --> 00:51:54,820
for going in there and starting that
fight at their dinner table like that.

938
00:51:54,895 --> 00:51:57,510
If Jason don't wanna jump the broom,
he don't have to jump the broom.

939
00:51:57,579 --> 00:52:00,897
Willie Earl, the only reason
I brought you up here was to support me.

940
00:52:00,972 --> 00:52:03,306
I told my brother
I was gonna help raise his son.

941
00:52:03,372 --> 00:52:04,685
I'm here to support Jason.

942
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:06,919
Well, it really ain't your business.

943
00:52:07,502 --> 00:52:10,984
It isn't none of my business.
Remember that? Bougie?

944
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:13,549
Let me tell you something, Pam.

945
00:52:14,573 --> 00:52:16,359
If you keep fighting progress,

946
00:52:17,296 --> 00:52:18,982
you gonna find yourself
on the wrong side of history.

947
00:52:19,054 --> 00:52:20,482
-Whatever.
-And that's real talk.

948
00:52:21,710 --> 00:52:23,469
Yeah, it's gonna be whatever.

949
00:52:24,365 --> 00:52:26,276
God don't like ugly, Pam.

950
00:52:27,408 --> 00:52:29,351
He ain't too fond of cute.

951
00:52:32,623 --> 00:52:35,115
I just think the best gift
you can give anyone

952
00:52:35,165 --> 00:52:37,128
on their wedding day is the truth.

953
00:52:37,228 --> 00:52:39,754
-Have you completely lost your mind?
-What?

954
00:52:39,824 --> 00:52:41,317
You think of no one but yourself.

955
00:52:41,392 --> 00:52:43,527
And who are you thinking about,
Claudine?

956
00:52:43,596 --> 00:52:44,878
Are you thinking about Sabrina?

957
00:52:44,944 --> 00:52:47,080
Are you thinking about what people
will say behind closed doors?

958
00:52:47,149 --> 00:52:48,973
No, I could care less
what people think of me.

959
00:52:49,422 --> 00:52:51,333
-Please!
-I am always thinking of Sabrina.

960
00:52:51,407 --> 00:52:52,358
That's clear.

961
00:52:52,432 --> 00:52:54,440
I was thinking of Sabrina
when she went to kindergarten

962
00:52:54,514 --> 00:52:55,526
and when she went to college.

963
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:58,187
I could write you a whole list
if you need me to, Geneva.

964
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:01,925
You want me to throw you a parade?
Petition you for sainthood?

965
00:53:02,641 --> 00:53:06,153
You didn't do me any favors.
You did Mother a favor.

966
00:53:06,257 --> 00:53:10,085
I didn't give you Sabrina.
Mother took her from me!

967
00:53:10,192 --> 00:53:12,298
Well, what would you have done
with her, Geneva?

968
00:53:12,532 --> 00:53:16,141
Pack her in a suitcase every time you
felt like flying off to a new adventure?

969
00:53:16,209 --> 00:53:17,485
What, get pregnant again?

970
00:53:17,586 --> 00:53:19,180
Well, at least I could get pregnant.

971
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:34,487
If you come anywhere
near my daughter this weekend

972
00:53:34,952 --> 00:53:37,039
with any of your foolishness,

973
00:53:37,107 --> 00:53:39,980
you will regret it
for the rest of your life.

974
00:53:46,741 --> 00:53:48,626
Yes, Malcolm,
it was nice to meet you, too.

975
00:53:48,690 --> 00:53:51,628
Hold it, hold on.
Okay, don't be too hasty.

976
00:53:51,702 --> 00:53:53,293
I usually
don't talk to dark-skinned girls,

977
00:53:53,328 --> 00:53:55,215
but I'm making an exception for you.

978
00:53:55,285 --> 00:53:56,942
So, how about we...

979
00:54:02,263 --> 00:54:04,333
-You don't like handcuffs?
-That is not the same thing, Jason.

980
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:06,772
-Rude, ghetto, same thing.
-No, it's not.

981
00:54:06,869 --> 00:54:08,975
Look, look, at the end of the day,

982
00:54:09,046 --> 00:54:11,316
I honestly don't care
if we jump the broom or not, Sabrina.

983
00:54:11,415 --> 00:54:13,516
You don't care and I don't want to,
so why do it?

984
00:54:13,587 --> 00:54:15,053
Because it would make her happy.

985
00:54:15,158 --> 00:54:17,231
Look, this woman sacrificed everything
for me.

986
00:54:17,302 --> 00:54:18,163
And, quite frankly,

987
00:54:18,382 --> 00:54:20,470
if it wasn't for my mother,
I wouldn't be the man you wanna marry.

988
00:54:20,537 --> 00:54:21,646
If it wasn't for your mother,

989
00:54:21,719 --> 00:54:23,607
I wouldn't be questioning
if you're the man I wanna marry.

990
00:54:24,599 --> 00:54:28,910
So, you're questioning marrying me now
because of my mother?

991
00:54:29,495 --> 00:54:32,343
She's disrespecting my family
and she's treating you like a child.

992
00:54:32,630 --> 00:54:34,418
You're letting her
talk to me any kind of way.

993
00:54:34,745 --> 00:54:37,971
A husband is supposed to defend
his wife, remember? Leave to cleave?

994
00:54:38,039 --> 00:54:41,269
Look, Sabrina,
she's always gonna be my mother.

995
00:54:41,337 --> 00:54:43,475
-I know.
-But you are not my wife yet.

996
00:54:45,945 --> 00:54:47,920
You're right. I'm not.

997
00:54:47,994 --> 00:54:50,131
Which makes it so much easier
to walk away from you, Jason.

998
00:54:50,199 --> 00:54:51,761
Look, I didn't... What are you saying?

999
00:54:51,866 --> 00:54:53,295
I'm saying you're a mama's boy.

1000
00:54:53,593 --> 00:54:55,218
Does she know you're out right now?

1001
00:54:55,291 --> 00:54:56,595
Do you need to text her?
Do you need to check in?

1002
00:54:56,662 --> 00:54:59,536
Do you have a curfew?
Are you allowed to be out past 12:00?

1003
00:55:00,091 --> 00:55:01,749
This is ridiculous.

1004
00:55:05,594 --> 00:55:06,870
I need a drink.

1005
00:55:06,939 --> 00:55:10,767
And not one that's thrown on me, either.
It's a $200 jacket, man.

1006
00:55:13,146 --> 00:55:15,699
-Can I holler at you for a minute?
-Do I have a choice, Malcolm?

1007
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:19,120
Look, I've known you your entire life,
all right?

1008
00:55:19,194 --> 00:55:20,721
You messing up.

1009
00:55:20,796 --> 00:55:22,292
Your mama mad at you.

1010
00:55:22,366 --> 00:55:25,114
From the look of things,
your girl pretty mad at you.

1011
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:28,662
You rushing in, marrying this girl.
You don't know her.

1012
00:55:28,733 --> 00:55:31,417
I get it, she's rich, her family's rich.

1013
00:55:31,485 --> 00:55:33,076
It's the come-up.

1014
00:55:33,147 --> 00:55:34,743
But do you wanna be one of those guys?

1015
00:55:34,812 --> 00:55:37,333
What kind of guys are you talking about?

1016
00:55:37,405 --> 00:55:38,867
One of them guys.

1017
00:55:38,942 --> 00:55:41,527
The kind of guy that'll do any and
everything to get where they wanna be.

1018
00:55:41,884 --> 00:55:44,088
It's all falling apart right
before your eyes. You know why?

1019
00:55:44,156 --> 00:55:45,683
You going about it
for the wrong reasons.

1020
00:55:48,346 --> 00:55:49,594
That's what this is all about, isn't it?

1021
00:55:49,662 --> 00:55:50,641
What?

1022
00:55:50,716 --> 00:55:55,608
You're just mad because Ricky
and not you is my best man, right?

1023
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:56,790
-Nope.
-Tell the truth.

1024
00:55:56,860 --> 00:56:00,157
You know what? Yeah, I'm upset. I am.

1025
00:56:00,414 --> 00:56:02,137
I'm your cousin
and I'm your best friend,

1026
00:56:02,207 --> 00:56:03,636
but I ain't good enough
to be your best man.

1027
00:56:04,126 --> 00:56:05,557
That's what you basically telling me.

1028
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:07,934
You'd be the best man at my wedding.
Whassup?

1029
00:56:08,033 --> 00:56:09,340
Okay. You wanna talk, let's talk.

1030
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,580
Yeah, let's do it. Let's talk.

1031
00:56:12,415 --> 00:56:14,653
You are my cousin,
but the whole best friend thing?

1032
00:56:14,752 --> 00:56:16,637
Come on, Malcolm. Who are you fooling?

1033
00:56:16,732 --> 00:56:19,123
We haven't been best friends
for, what, two, three years?

1034
00:56:20,063 --> 00:56:21,690
Right around the time I bought my house.

1035
00:56:21,761 --> 00:56:23,646
I have a housewarming,
you don't show up.

1036
00:56:24,034 --> 00:56:25,720
I got promoted to vice president.

1037
00:56:25,953 --> 00:56:30,905
The entire block shows up.
Eddie, Casual Mike, even Dave comes.

1038
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:32,919
Did you come? No.

1039
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:35,612
Because you don't like hanging
around white people?

1040
00:56:35,681 --> 00:56:37,339
Hey, man.
Whenever I'm around white people,

1041
00:56:37,408 --> 00:56:40,225
-you know I get arrested.
-This isn't funny, Malcolm.

1042
00:56:40,288 --> 00:56:42,875
The only time you don't have something
negative to say about my success

1043
00:56:42,946 --> 00:56:44,701
is when you're on the phone
asking me for money.

1044
00:56:46,081 --> 00:56:47,193
Exactly.

1045
00:56:47,265 --> 00:56:51,422
So, the answer to this big question
you have in your head, no.

1046
00:56:52,415 --> 00:56:55,451
Money did not change me. It changed you.

1047
00:56:56,835 --> 00:57:00,380
Thanks for the advice,
but, frankly, I don't need it.

1048
00:57:03,138 --> 00:57:04,600
You're welcome.

1049
00:57:07,652 --> 00:57:10,650
The hell money changed me.
I ain't got none. Explain that.

1050
00:57:26,181 --> 00:57:27,642
I've been looking all over for you.

1051
00:57:30,851 --> 00:57:32,130
Here I am.

1052
00:57:32,708 --> 00:57:34,051
Thought you said you were coming to bed.

1053
00:57:36,899 --> 00:57:39,040
Things change. Don't they?

1054
00:57:41,670 --> 00:57:42,717
Yeah.

1055
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:45,307
Yeah, they do.

1056
00:57:49,926 --> 00:57:50,908
Claudine?

1057
00:57:52,549 --> 00:57:54,462
You don't have to say it.

1058
00:57:55,206 --> 00:57:58,523
The late nights,
the incessant phone calls.

1059
00:57:59,496 --> 00:58:02,911
The way you looked
at that tramp of yours all night long.

1060
00:58:05,416 --> 00:58:06,725
You think I'm having an affair?

1061
00:58:06,824 --> 00:58:08,682
Please. Let's not do this.

1062
00:58:08,747 --> 00:58:11,136
I'm not having an affair, Claudine.

1063
00:58:12,808 --> 00:58:13,821
We're broke.

1064
00:58:15,083 --> 00:58:16,225
Broke?

1065
00:58:16,777 --> 00:58:18,402
Yes, broke.

1066
00:58:18,728 --> 00:58:20,767
This is not the moment for a joke.

1067
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:23,745
Claude, I am not joking.

1068
00:58:29,837 --> 00:58:32,451
Oh, my God, Gregg.
How is that even possible?

1069
00:58:32,842 --> 00:58:35,743
With the credit freeze,
we didn't have enough cash up-front,

1070
00:58:35,852 --> 00:58:38,368
so we had to sell off assets at a loss.

1071
00:58:39,724 --> 00:58:41,279
It's complicated.

1072
00:58:41,770 --> 00:58:45,478
Basically, I think we were
a little too aggressive.

1073
00:58:45,549 --> 00:58:46,529
We?

1074
00:58:47,724 --> 00:58:48,901
We were too aggressive?

1075
00:58:48,971 --> 00:58:51,273
All right, I was too aggressive.

1076
00:58:51,338 --> 00:58:52,599
You didn't seem
to complain all those years

1077
00:58:52,603 --> 00:58:54,506
you lived off my aggressive investments.

1078
00:58:54,573 --> 00:58:58,055
Do not confuse your love for
the finer things in life with my values.

1079
00:58:58,127 --> 00:58:59,811
Unlike you, I could afford them.

1080
00:58:59,881 --> 00:59:01,738
Unlike you, I worked for them!

1081
00:59:02,093 --> 00:59:03,879
What exactly is broke?

1082
00:59:08,043 --> 00:59:11,044
Most of our retirement fund's
been wiped out.

1083
00:59:11,116 --> 00:59:12,459
We can barely afford this wedding,

1084
00:59:13,453 --> 00:59:16,135
let alone the kids' honeymoon.

1085
00:59:16,911 --> 00:59:18,438
All we have left

1086
00:59:22,704 --> 00:59:23,911
is this house.

1087
00:59:24,426 --> 00:59:28,172
Honestly, Gregory, an affair might
have been easier to swallow.

1088
00:59:29,742 --> 00:59:34,477
And just so I'm clear, are you saying
that all my family's money is gone?

1089
00:59:35,663 --> 00:59:36,973
That's what I'm saying.

1090
00:59:39,375 --> 00:59:41,040
Well, if the sofa
hasn't been repossessed,

1091
00:59:41,103 --> 00:59:43,915
please find yourself on it tonight.

1092
00:59:53,104 --> 00:59:55,043
No, absolutely not.
I am not doing this again.

1093
00:59:55,149 --> 00:59:57,543
Claude, I'm not playing this game
with you.

1094
00:59:57,616 --> 01:00:00,463
I'm gonna have some leftover vichyssoise

1095
01:00:00,528 --> 01:00:02,951
and I am gonna pour myself a Scotch.

1096
01:00:03,534 --> 01:00:06,603
Then I'm gonna go up to our bedroom,
get into our bed,

1097
01:00:07,374 --> 01:00:10,159
go to sleep, and snore.

1098
01:00:12,913 --> 01:00:14,954
Whether you're there or not.

1099
01:00:35,728 --> 01:00:37,193
Hey, girl!

1100
01:00:37,268 --> 01:00:39,180
This water feels so good.

1101
01:00:40,243 --> 01:00:43,061
I haven't been swimming in so long.

1102
01:00:51,124 --> 01:00:54,437
You crazy. Get out of that water, girl.

1103
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:57,869
You know, I knew something wasn't right
about this family.

1104
01:00:58,005 --> 01:01:00,906
All the money and the big houses
and them weird accents.

1105
01:01:00,980 --> 01:01:03,116
Yeah, but you know what, Pam?
That ain't got nothing to do with it

1106
01:01:03,188 --> 01:01:04,847
'cause, you know,
you didn't wanna like 'em from the get.

1107
01:01:05,171 --> 01:01:07,824
Honey, that's because
I can tell a fake a mile away.

1108
01:01:07,926 --> 01:01:09,867
And I'll tell you this.
Now that I know what's going on,

1109
01:01:09,945 --> 01:01:12,397
-I don't want Jason mixed up
in this mess. -Okay.

1110
01:01:12,469 --> 01:01:15,819
Talking about sending him to China.
Do they even let black folk in China?

1111
01:01:15,893 --> 01:01:18,228
You know what, Pam,
I've known Jason his whole life,

1112
01:01:18,294 --> 01:01:20,683
and the boy has never been happier,
so leave him alone!

1113
01:01:20,758 --> 01:01:24,980
That's exactly my point. He can stay
in the US of A and stay happy.

1114
01:01:26,041 --> 01:01:28,692
No. I'll break this wedding up
if I have to,

1115
01:01:28,761 --> 01:01:30,005
-I tell you that.
-You know what, Just stop that.

1116
01:01:30,105 --> 01:01:31,050
What?

1117
01:01:31,127 --> 01:01:34,001
Just 'cause you got that young boy rubbing
on your old ashy legs,

1118
01:01:34,054 --> 01:01:35,154
you ain't gotta act out.

1119
01:01:35,225 --> 01:01:36,304
Yeah, well, that's one way to go.

1120
01:01:36,407 --> 01:01:39,027
And if you had somebody
rubbing up your little ashy leg,

1121
01:01:39,097 --> 01:01:41,431
maybe you would stop
getting into everybody else's business

1122
01:01:41,497 --> 01:01:43,318
because you'd have some of your own.

1123
01:01:43,382 --> 01:01:47,162
I tell you this, you about two days
from being a pedophile.

1124
01:01:47,768 --> 01:01:50,103
-He is young, ain't he? But he fine.
-Girl.

1125
01:01:50,168 --> 01:01:51,957
-Let's brush you.
-How old is that boy anyway?

1126
01:01:52,024 --> 01:01:54,644
-Twenty.
-Cougar, cougar, cougar, cougar.

1127
01:01:55,609 --> 01:01:56,654
You so crazy.

1128
01:01:57,146 --> 01:01:58,670
-Girl, you ought to be ashamed
of yourself. -Hush up.

1129
01:01:58,742 --> 01:02:02,358
Don't be mad 'cause you keep trying
to get your man off of a oldman.com.

1130
01:02:04,567 --> 01:02:07,919
So, this is what happens
at a bachelor party?

1131
01:02:07,993 --> 01:02:10,001
No, this is what happens at a funeral.

1132
01:02:10,426 --> 01:02:13,209
At a bachelor party,
there's a lot of alcohol,

1133
01:02:13,276 --> 01:02:17,400
and we drunk by now, with some lady
named Cinnamon Bun dancing on our lap,

1134
01:02:17,562 --> 01:02:19,473
like strippers, like they're bouncing.

1135
01:02:19,676 --> 01:02:22,009
Yeah, that's what happens
at a traditional bachelor party.

1136
01:02:22,074 --> 01:02:23,119
I don't know what happened here.

1137
01:02:25,915 --> 01:02:28,119
-Ready?
-So, you're not angry anymore?

1138
01:02:29,115 --> 01:02:30,490
I wanna go and they don't.

1139
01:02:30,557 --> 01:02:32,465
I'm not really ready to leave either.

1140
01:02:32,538 --> 01:02:33,619
But I wanna go home.

1141
01:02:33,695 --> 01:02:34,837
We have a big day tomorrow.

1142
01:02:34,939 --> 01:02:37,359
Babe, I'm in the middle
of a conversation right now.

1143
01:02:37,434 --> 01:02:40,949
For you to ask me to just walk out
on it, it's kind of rude.

1144
01:02:41,020 --> 01:02:42,682
-Rude?
-I didn't say ghetto.

1145
01:02:43,484 --> 01:02:46,238
Hey, hey, hey, guys. It's not that
serious. Jay, we can just call it, man.

1146
01:02:46,303 --> 01:02:48,091
I can't believe you're doing this
in front of everybody.

1147
01:02:48,157 --> 01:02:50,427
Look, babe, I called my mom,

1148
01:02:50,494 --> 01:02:53,840
and she said I can stay out as late
as I want tonight, so, don't be a brat.

1149
01:02:54,748 --> 01:02:55,732
A brat?

1150
01:02:57,436 --> 01:02:59,227
Fine. Have fun with your friends.

1151
01:03:01,886 --> 01:03:04,856
Hey! "Brat"?
Come on, man, you from Brooklyn.

1152
01:03:04,928 --> 01:03:07,132
"Brat" is the only B word
you could think of right now?

1153
01:03:07,201 --> 01:03:09,564
Jay, you don't wanna do this. You know
you're gonna get in some trouble.

1154
01:03:09,630 --> 01:03:10,714
Shut up. Look at your shirt.

1155
01:03:11,679 --> 01:03:13,471
Look, you did the right thing, Jay.

1156
01:03:13,537 --> 01:03:15,771
You're supposed to put your foot down
when women act like that.

1157
01:03:16,125 --> 01:03:17,469
Put 'em in their place, man.

1158
01:03:17,536 --> 01:03:21,049
And you are giving the wrong idea
to this young buck right here.

1159
01:03:21,151 --> 01:03:24,566
Malcolm. What do you know about a woman?

1160
01:03:25,248 --> 01:03:27,224
Now, let's be real.
You know, I don't understand

1161
01:03:27,296 --> 01:03:29,020
why y'all are chasing these young girls.

1162
01:03:29,088 --> 01:03:32,057
You know, me, myself,
I prefer a more seasoned woman.

1163
01:03:32,129 --> 01:03:34,776
Someone with a little experience,
mature.

1164
01:03:34,849 --> 01:03:38,265
You know, you gotta grow up
and leave the childish games behind you.

1165
01:03:38,338 --> 01:03:41,536
Yeah, you're 12, so I don't wanna
hear nothing you got to say.

1166
01:03:41,604 --> 01:03:43,453
Okay, first of all,
neither one of you guys understand.

1167
01:03:43,518 --> 01:03:45,015
All right,
this man's about to get married.

1168
01:03:45,088 --> 01:03:47,994
-"You don't... Neither one
of you guys..." -Jason, forget all this.

1169
01:03:48,068 --> 01:03:50,748
You need to go get Sabrina
and squash all this. I'm serious.

1170
01:03:50,817 --> 01:03:53,501
Jason, don't listen to nobody
that say words like "squash," all right?

1171
01:03:53,570 --> 01:03:56,123
"Squash all this." We don't talk
like that. We from the hood, man.

1172
01:03:56,226 --> 01:03:57,600
You don't even know Sabrina.
I know Sabrina.

1173
01:03:57,664 --> 01:03:59,839
-And I know Jason.
-Jason, go get your girl, man.

1174
01:03:59,905 --> 01:04:01,280
Jason, get your manhood.

1175
01:04:04,995 --> 01:04:06,524
Another round.

1176
01:04:06,597 --> 01:04:07,966
And that's how you do it.

1177
01:04:08,031 --> 01:04:09,822
Yes! This is turning
into a bachelor party.

1178
01:04:09,890 --> 01:04:12,280
Now you gonna have some fun.
Ladies, please! Ladies!

1179
01:04:12,354 --> 01:04:13,369
Not... Not you.

1180
01:04:14,048 --> 01:04:15,743
I'd hate to be you in a hour.

1181
01:04:15,812 --> 01:04:18,717
Sebastian,
I got this all under control.

1182
01:04:20,416 --> 01:04:21,597
Sabrina!

1183
01:04:25,316 --> 01:04:26,491
Sabrina!

1184
01:04:31,685 --> 01:04:33,921
-God, you taste good.
-So do you.

1185
01:04:38,181 --> 01:04:40,385
You wanna taste something good?

1186
01:04:40,932 --> 01:04:43,651
It's sweet, but there's a little spice
in it as well.

1187
01:04:43,718 --> 01:04:45,279
Sort of like you.

1188
01:04:47,269 --> 01:04:48,251
It's good, right?

1189
01:04:54,661 --> 01:04:55,746
Burning.

1190
01:04:56,966 --> 01:04:57,980
Burning.

1191
01:04:58,345 --> 01:04:59,356
Burning, yeah.

1192
01:04:59,429 --> 01:05:01,118
No, no, no, it's burning, it's burning.

1193
01:05:05,670 --> 01:05:06,881
My sauce.

1194
01:05:07,495 --> 01:05:08,804
Oh, my God!

1195
01:05:11,112 --> 01:05:12,159
What the...

1196
01:05:12,426 --> 01:05:14,015
Is everybody okay?

1197
01:05:14,793 --> 01:05:18,403
I was just making some sauce.

1198
01:05:20,072 --> 01:05:21,217
My helper.

1199
01:05:21,321 --> 01:05:25,313
Listen, everything's under control.
The alarm should go off in a minute.

1200
01:05:25,384 --> 01:05:29,130
This in no way impedes my ability
to do my job.

1201
01:05:29,449 --> 01:05:32,416
I want you to know that.
So, as you were.

1202
01:05:41,420 --> 01:05:42,432
Babe.

1203
01:05:43,243 --> 01:05:45,187
Sabrina. Sabrina.

1204
01:05:47,115 --> 01:05:49,385
I mean, I know you ain't
got your private parts out

1205
01:05:49,450 --> 01:05:50,726
around all this good food, do you?

1206
01:05:51,883 --> 01:05:54,499
And second of all,
do you have any kind of relationship

1207
01:05:54,570 --> 01:05:56,840
with some Vaseline lotion or anything?

1208
01:05:56,938 --> 01:06:00,518
Your knees look like you been praying
in some chicken flour.

1209
01:06:06,540 --> 01:06:08,644
Sabrina, please, just let me...

1210
01:06:11,852 --> 01:06:13,477
Sabrina, let me in.

1211
01:06:13,964 --> 01:06:16,931
Come on, open up, Sabrina.
I just wanna talk to you.

1212
01:06:18,447 --> 01:06:20,202
Okay, fine, I'll wait

1213
01:06:21,803 --> 01:06:24,107
all night, if I have to.

1214
01:07:03,953 --> 01:07:05,199
I love you, too.

1215
01:07:07,984 --> 01:07:11,598
Jason? Are we getting married too fast?

1216
01:07:13,426 --> 01:07:15,017
You're not having second thoughts,
are you, babe?

1217
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:17,937
No, I'm just... I'm asking.

1218
01:07:19,277 --> 01:07:21,551
Did we rush into this because of China?

1219
01:07:21,618 --> 01:07:23,405
Baby, open the door.
I wanna look at you.

1220
01:07:23,472 --> 01:07:25,863
I can't. You're not supposed
to see the bride before the wedding.

1221
01:07:26,292 --> 01:07:27,402
Right.

1222
01:07:29,717 --> 01:07:32,434
No, babe,
we're not rushing into anything.

1223
01:07:33,745 --> 01:07:34,976
I knew from the first day we went out

1224
01:07:34,999 --> 01:07:37,160
that I'd spend the rest
of my life with you.

1225
01:07:38,741 --> 01:07:40,049
You're my heart, Sabrina.

1226
01:07:41,842 --> 01:07:43,565
You're my heart, too.

1227
01:07:45,875 --> 01:07:48,529
-Jason, let's not do this again, okay?
-All right.

1228
01:07:48,598 --> 01:07:50,836
Let's not let other people get in
between the two of us.

1229
01:07:57,143 --> 01:07:58,480
Pinky swear?

1230
01:08:00,727 --> 01:08:02,066
Pinky swear.

1231
01:09:25,083 --> 01:09:26,609
Sabrina, get up!

1232
01:09:27,450 --> 01:09:28,724
I'm awake.

1233
01:09:31,356 --> 01:09:33,496
-Morning.
-Morning.

1234
01:09:33,980 --> 01:09:37,939
I wanted to give you this
before everything gets hectic today.

1235
01:09:38,011 --> 01:09:39,324
What's this?

1236
01:09:40,475 --> 01:09:42,166
This was Grand-Mère's.

1237
01:09:42,238 --> 01:09:43,960
And her Grand-Mère's.

1238
01:09:44,411 --> 01:09:47,378
Something old. It's lovely, Mom.
Thank you.

1239
01:09:47,453 --> 01:09:48,827
You're welcome.

1240
01:09:48,893 --> 01:09:50,800
Thank you for everything.

1241
01:09:51,133 --> 01:09:54,779
Sweetheart, we love Jason.

1242
01:09:55,773 --> 01:09:57,816
But are you sure about this?

1243
01:09:59,102 --> 01:10:02,037
How can you ask me that?
Are you trying to ruin my wedding day?

1244
01:10:02,110 --> 01:10:03,090
No.

1245
01:10:03,163 --> 01:10:04,953
I've never stood in the way
of your dreams,

1246
01:10:05,021 --> 01:10:07,325
but what kind of mother would I be
if I didn't ask?

1247
01:10:07,708 --> 01:10:09,783
Sabrina, marriage is serious.

1248
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:13,107
It's for life. Are you ready?

1249
01:10:13,182 --> 01:10:14,199
Yes.

1250
01:10:16,895 --> 01:10:18,102
Are you and Dad getting a divorce?

1251
01:10:19,042 --> 01:10:20,827
Now, why would you ask me that?

1252
01:10:20,896 --> 01:10:22,589
"Go play with your whore over there."

1253
01:10:24,962 --> 01:10:29,083
I was wrong.
Your father's not having an affair.

1254
01:10:29,377 --> 01:10:32,093
Mom, I see the way
you guys treat each other.

1255
01:10:33,376 --> 01:10:36,026
You don't look at each other anymore
when you talk.

1256
01:10:36,097 --> 01:10:39,871
-You don't even touch each other.
-We're not getting a divorce.

1257
01:10:40,672 --> 01:10:42,133
The vows say for better or for worse,

1258
01:10:42,208 --> 01:10:46,103
and even though we're pretty close,
we're not at our worse.

1259
01:10:46,366 --> 01:10:50,460
No matter what, I'm still committed
to your father and I still love him.

1260
01:10:50,689 --> 01:10:53,311
-No matter what happens?
-No matter what.

1261
01:10:54,593 --> 01:10:56,633
I want that with Jason, Mom.

1262
01:10:57,312 --> 01:10:59,223
I want that for you, too.

1263
01:11:00,962 --> 01:11:03,549
I'll tell you something that Mabel
told me the day I got married.

1264
01:11:04,990 --> 01:11:07,479
Life is like a disco.

1265
01:11:07,906 --> 01:11:11,224
No matter how the music changes,
you just keep dancing.

1266
01:11:14,178 --> 01:11:16,001
That sounds like Mabel.

1267
01:11:16,738 --> 01:11:17,786
Mom.

1268
01:11:19,395 --> 01:11:22,049
I can't lie to you. I'm nervous.

1269
01:11:22,116 --> 01:11:24,766
Sweetheart.

1270
01:11:26,727 --> 01:11:29,113
This is gonna be a great day, right?

1271
01:11:31,012 --> 01:11:32,121
It is.

1272
01:11:32,517 --> 01:11:34,884
Jason, you know I love you
and I want the best for you.

1273
01:11:34,949 --> 01:11:36,288
I know, Mama, I know.

1274
01:11:36,355 --> 01:11:39,041
Well, what is done in the dark
must come to light.

1275
01:11:39,112 --> 01:11:41,662
Mama, Mama, listen. What's wrong?

1276
01:11:42,308 --> 01:11:43,966
You should be happy.
You're one step closer

1277
01:11:44,036 --> 01:11:45,413
to getting those grandkids
you've been wanting.

1278
01:11:45,479 --> 01:11:48,478
Jason, I need to tell you something
and I feel that now is the...

1279
01:11:48,550 --> 01:11:50,239
Good morning, Pam.

1280
01:11:50,790 --> 01:11:52,864
-Jason, you ready?
-I'm ready, I'm ready.

1281
01:11:52,936 --> 01:11:55,010
Mama, smile. Okay?

1282
01:11:55,336 --> 01:11:58,749
-Smile. Hold that thought!
-Jason, I need to talk to you!

1283
01:12:05,192 --> 01:12:08,289
Yes, yes, yes,
I want some of that, that.

1284
01:12:08,996 --> 01:12:10,275
Excuse me.

1285
01:12:10,887 --> 01:12:13,026
Wait, why do you keep leaving?

1286
01:12:13,095 --> 01:12:15,166
'Cause I'm not trying to go to prison.

1287
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:16,770
I see you got jokes.

1288
01:12:17,896 --> 01:12:20,007
Boy, do you know I could snap your
little butt

1289
01:12:20,023 --> 01:12:21,640
in two with all these curves?

1290
01:12:22,087 --> 01:12:23,232
You promise?

1291
01:12:23,304 --> 01:12:25,090
Okay, so now you got jokes.

1292
01:12:25,157 --> 01:12:27,775
Look, I may have the body
of a 20-year-old,

1293
01:12:27,848 --> 01:12:31,325
but I have the heart, the mind,
and the soul of a grown man.

1294
01:12:32,299 --> 01:12:34,882
That doesn't change the date
on your birth certificate.

1295
01:12:36,265 --> 01:12:38,601
Well, I'm sorry you feel that way.

1296
01:12:42,219 --> 01:12:43,525
Help me, Jesus.

1297
01:12:44,042 --> 01:12:45,602
That boy is fine.

1298
01:12:59,947 --> 01:13:04,765
If there is any Geneva drama today,
I will unleash a world of hurt.

1299
01:13:22,923 --> 01:13:25,257
What a surprise. You speak French?

1300
01:13:28,109 --> 01:13:29,572
That's Spanish.

1301
01:13:31,245 --> 01:13:32,738
Fool.

1302
01:13:34,509 --> 01:13:35,972
I'm not a fool.

1303
01:13:36,591 --> 01:13:40,333
And I'm not a scientist.
But I do know some things.

1304
01:13:55,662 --> 01:13:57,321
What are you doing way over there?

1305
01:13:57,390 --> 01:13:58,376
Hey.

1306
01:14:01,584 --> 01:14:03,470
Don't you look sweet enough to eat.

1307
01:14:03,756 --> 01:14:04,809
Wait.

1308
01:14:05,614 --> 01:14:06,892
I'm sorry.

1309
01:14:08,976 --> 01:14:10,121
I thought you wanted this.

1310
01:14:10,192 --> 01:14:11,654
I did. I did.

1311
01:14:12,207 --> 01:14:14,629
Well, I thought I did. I don't know.

1312
01:14:14,707 --> 01:14:17,258
Maybe it's because my best friend
is getting married today, and I'm not.

1313
01:14:18,255 --> 01:14:19,307
You know, it's...

1314
01:14:20,177 --> 01:14:21,770
You're not the kind of guy I'm used to.

1315
01:14:22,190 --> 01:14:23,787
What are you still doing here?

1316
01:14:27,155 --> 01:14:28,168
I don't know.

1317
01:14:30,450 --> 01:14:32,109
But I need to know.

1318
01:14:34,899 --> 01:14:36,207
What do you think of me?

1319
01:14:37,523 --> 01:14:39,347
What do I think of you?

1320
01:14:41,330 --> 01:14:42,791
You're like a pomegranate.

1321
01:14:44,245 --> 01:14:45,257
Like a piece of fruit?

1322
01:14:46,991 --> 01:14:49,479
You have this hard, protective shell.

1323
01:14:49,779 --> 01:14:52,845
You know, the jewelry, the clothes.
The sharp tongue.

1324
01:14:54,995 --> 01:14:58,312
But underneath that shell,
you're real sweet. A real beauty inside.

1325
01:15:01,139 --> 01:15:02,188
You see all that?

1326
01:15:02,419 --> 01:15:03,435
Yes, I do.

1327
01:15:07,060 --> 01:15:08,435
I'd love to tell you more.

1328
01:15:08,950 --> 01:15:10,705
But first,
I have a date with some chicken.

1329
01:15:12,376 --> 01:15:14,093
-Yeah.
-See you later?

1330
01:15:25,749 --> 01:15:27,506
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

1331
01:15:35,862 --> 01:15:38,065
So, you went crawling back
like a little girl.

1332
01:15:38,134 --> 01:15:40,044
Is that what you did?
You had to go back for that money?

1333
01:15:40,119 --> 01:15:43,052
Mr. Watson with the ball,
quarterbacking.

1334
01:15:43,128 --> 01:15:45,650
He's got a half-gray,
half-black Jheri curl.

1335
01:15:46,648 --> 01:15:47,597
A-one.

1336
01:15:47,673 --> 01:15:49,464
Maybe you should get
two wedding dresses made.

1337
01:15:49,531 --> 01:15:51,051
Two girls getting married.

1338
01:15:52,152 --> 01:15:53,461
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

1339
01:15:53,528 --> 01:15:54,958
Throw the ball, baby!

1340
01:15:55,032 --> 01:15:56,015
What the...

1341
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:58,063
-Hey, man!
-What the hell was that?

1342
01:15:58,137 --> 01:15:59,345
It's touch football, pretty boy.

1343
01:15:59,610 --> 01:16:01,364
-You call that touch?
-Yeah, I touched you, didn't I?

1344
01:16:01,432 --> 01:16:04,945
Come on, Malcolm, take off that halter
top so we can see your belly ring!

1345
01:16:05,016 --> 01:16:07,184
Looking like America's Next Top Model!

1346
01:16:07,289 --> 01:16:09,198
Roses right this way.

1347
01:16:11,963 --> 01:16:14,515
Thank you again for doing this
at the 11th hour, Reverend James.

1348
01:16:14,586 --> 01:16:16,498
It means the world to us.

1349
01:16:17,210 --> 01:16:19,346
Yes. See you then.

1350
01:16:19,865 --> 01:16:20,881
Thank you.

1351
01:16:22,039 --> 01:16:23,154
Anything I can do?

1352
01:16:23,226 --> 01:16:24,787
Mrs. Watson,
we have a problem in the kitchen.

1353
01:16:24,858 --> 01:16:26,748
Yes. Stay out of my way.

1354
01:16:30,779 --> 01:16:31,925
Really.

1355
01:16:33,755 --> 01:16:34,932
It looks beautiful.

1356
01:16:35,292 --> 01:16:37,394
Thank you so much for wearing the dress.

1357
01:16:37,467 --> 01:16:40,850
Here, this is for the wedding.
I hope you like gardenias.

1358
01:16:42,139 --> 01:16:44,528
Of course, you don't have to wear it
if you don't want to.

1359
01:16:47,228 --> 01:16:51,420
Listen, Mrs. Taylor, I really want to
apologize about last night.

1360
01:16:51,485 --> 01:16:53,339
Nobody meant any harm and...

1361
01:16:53,405 --> 01:16:55,772
Well, it's your wedding.

1362
01:16:55,836 --> 01:16:58,768
It's stressful and I understand.

1363
01:16:59,001 --> 01:17:00,412
Thank you.

1364
01:17:00,956 --> 01:17:04,305
And I know you want us
to jump the broom,

1365
01:17:04,379 --> 01:17:06,651
but Jason and I
wanna start our own traditions,

1366
01:17:06,763 --> 01:17:08,634
so we're probably not gonna do it.

1367
01:17:09,373 --> 01:17:13,631
I'm out of pins.
I'll be right back. Do not move.

1368
01:17:14,238 --> 01:17:16,278
Thank you, Mabel. Looks lovely.

1369
01:17:19,070 --> 01:17:21,525
So nice to finally meet you
and your family.

1370
01:17:21,597 --> 01:17:25,112
Thank you. Well, I'm gonna go get ready
for the big day.

1371
01:17:25,852 --> 01:17:29,465
Your Aunt Geneva,
I really enjoyed her singing.

1372
01:17:29,534 --> 01:17:30,748
She's something else.

1373
01:17:30,848 --> 01:17:32,342
Well, that's my auntie.

1374
01:17:32,416 --> 01:17:36,122
Yeah, and your mother, she was
pretty upset about her doing that.

1375
01:17:36,899 --> 01:17:38,073
What do you mean?

1376
01:17:38,141 --> 01:17:43,068
Well, I saw them later,
last night, arguing.

1377
01:17:43,170 --> 01:17:44,762
It was pretty heated.

1378
01:17:45,630 --> 01:17:47,574
Well, I'm sure it was no big deal.

1379
01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:50,748
I mean, every family
has their issues, so...

1380
01:17:50,817 --> 01:17:54,131
You're right.
Every family has their issues.

1381
01:17:54,207 --> 01:17:55,455
And secrets.

1382
01:17:56,256 --> 01:17:59,075
Sabrina! Sabrina, come quick.
Jason's hurt.

1383
01:17:59,171 --> 01:18:02,039
Jason? Wait, don't go!

1384
01:18:02,113 --> 01:18:04,699
Jason? Jason, are you okay?

1385
01:18:04,997 --> 01:18:06,368
-Oh, my goodness!
-I'm fine, babe.

1386
01:18:06,686 --> 01:18:07,999
Who hurt my baby?

1387
01:18:08,097 --> 01:18:09,789
-What happened?
-Just...

1388
01:18:13,314 --> 01:18:14,971
Who hurt my baby?

1389
01:18:15,074 --> 01:18:16,055
He all right.

1390
01:18:16,131 --> 01:18:17,507
My fault, Auntie P. He was running.

1391
01:18:17,573 --> 01:18:19,513
You know,
he ain't been working out lately.

1392
01:18:19,942 --> 01:18:22,751
Jason. Honey, I'm gonna have
to take you home.

1393
01:18:22,847 --> 01:18:25,403
-Home? Where, to Brooklyn?
-Yes, to Brooklyn!

1394
01:18:25,477 --> 01:18:27,746
I can call your pediatrician,
Dr. Hunter.

1395
01:18:28,037 --> 01:18:29,496
Pediatrician, are you serious?

1396
01:18:29,637 --> 01:18:31,676
Pam, this grown man
don't need no pediatric...

1397
01:18:31,747 --> 01:18:33,854
Ain't nobody said pediatrician!

1398
01:18:33,926 --> 01:18:35,902
-Mom, I'm fine.
-Yeah, you going overboard.

1399
01:18:35,969 --> 01:18:37,829
Willie Earl,
ain't nobody asked you nothing.

1400
01:18:37,925 --> 01:18:40,673
-Okay?
-Come on, let me help you.

1401
01:18:40,900 --> 01:18:42,309
Thanks, babe.

1402
01:18:43,873 --> 01:18:45,501
Jason, what time is the ferry?

1403
01:18:45,572 --> 01:18:47,679
He's gonna be fine. We're just
gonna get him some ice, okay?

1404
01:18:47,749 --> 01:18:50,980
Now, you wait just one minute,
Miss Johnny-come-lately.

1405
01:18:52,036 --> 01:18:55,419
You haven't known my son over six,
what, seven months?

1406
01:18:55,685 --> 01:18:57,287
And who the hell
you think you are to know

1407
01:18:57,321 --> 01:19:00,127
what's best for him over his mother?

1408
01:19:00,197 --> 01:19:01,213
You know what?

1409
01:19:01,287 --> 01:19:05,030
I spent the last two days listening to
you disrespect Jason, me, my family...

1410
01:19:05,126 --> 01:19:08,604
Your family?
You think your family is so perfect?

1411
01:19:09,062 --> 01:19:11,778
Honey, you don't even know
who your parents are.

1412
01:19:13,288 --> 01:19:14,429
What are you talking about?

1413
01:19:14,533 --> 01:19:16,992
Ask your daddy who your real father is.

1414
01:19:17,064 --> 01:19:19,552
Mrs. Taylor! You are way out of line.

1415
01:19:20,007 --> 01:19:21,917
Dad, I mean, she's crazy.

1416
01:19:25,228 --> 01:19:26,238
Dad?

1417
01:19:27,046 --> 01:19:30,147
-What...
-Honey, it's complicated.

1418
01:19:30,248 --> 01:19:32,703
No, it's not complicated.

1419
01:19:32,776 --> 01:19:35,165
Either you are or aren't my father.

1420
01:19:39,048 --> 01:19:40,576
We should talk to your mother.

1421
01:19:41,704 --> 01:19:42,687
Fine, let's go.

1422
01:19:43,336 --> 01:19:44,353
Sabrina.

1423
01:19:44,905 --> 01:19:46,149
Yeah, go talk to your mama!

1424
01:19:47,434 --> 01:19:48,298
Really, Mom?

1425
01:19:52,492 --> 01:19:54,401
Keep chopping. I need that whole bowl.

1426
01:19:54,474 --> 01:19:57,507
We are going to have to polish
every one of these glasses, Mabel.

1427
01:19:59,977 --> 01:20:01,091
Look at this!

1428
01:20:01,161 --> 01:20:04,545
Sabrina's getting married
in three hours, and look at me!

1429
01:20:07,978 --> 01:20:09,385
Sorry. Look at you.

1430
01:20:18,924 --> 01:20:20,001
Great.

1431
01:20:24,750 --> 01:20:27,367
-What's wrong?
-Is there something you need to tell me?

1432
01:20:28,171 --> 01:20:30,278
Tell you? Tell you what?

1433
01:20:31,852 --> 01:20:34,665
-Why are you so upset?
-We should discuss this in private.

1434
01:20:34,762 --> 01:20:36,173
No, Dad, there's no more private here.

1435
01:20:36,812 --> 01:20:38,240
Somebody's gonna tell me the truth.

1436
01:20:38,830 --> 01:20:39,943
Mom?

1437
01:20:40,685 --> 01:20:44,578
Mom, tell me that this lady's crazy
and that she's making this up.

1438
01:20:45,934 --> 01:20:48,009
Tell me the truth.
Are you two my parents?

1439
01:20:58,862 --> 01:21:01,545
Sabrina, honey, listen.

1440
01:21:05,358 --> 01:21:06,539
I was 16.

1441
01:21:07,502 --> 01:21:10,886
Honey, your parents were... Honey,
they were already married, you know?

1442
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:13,578
It just made sense for them to take you.

1443
01:21:16,402 --> 01:21:17,577
Sweetheart.

1444
01:21:18,352 --> 01:21:21,221
From the moment I saw you,
you were mine.

1445
01:21:21,937 --> 01:21:24,841
And every moment that we spent together,
you became a part of me.

1446
01:21:24,980 --> 01:21:27,496
-I didn't wanna lose you.
-No, don't...

1447
01:21:48,146 --> 01:21:49,357
Happy now?

1448
01:21:51,667 --> 01:21:53,872
-The wedding's off.
-What?

1449
01:21:54,291 --> 01:21:55,669
You let this happen.

1450
01:21:56,561 --> 01:21:57,840
Sabrina...

1451
01:22:00,594 --> 01:22:01,907
Sabrina, hold on!

1452
01:22:05,814 --> 01:22:08,334
Sabrina, wait, let's talk about this!

1453
01:22:08,406 --> 01:22:11,219
Sabrina, wait! I'm gonna take care
of this! Come on, baby, please! Talk...

1454
01:22:11,285 --> 01:22:13,583
Sabrina! Sabrina!

1455
01:22:48,087 --> 01:22:50,126
-What was that?
-It was the truth.

1456
01:22:50,198 --> 01:22:51,117
I prayed on it.

1457
01:22:51,175 --> 01:22:53,842
-Somebody had to tell her.
-You prayed on it.

1458
01:22:53,910 --> 01:22:55,951
And God told you to do this?

1459
01:22:56,373 --> 01:22:58,861
To destroy a family
and ruin Sabrina's life?

1460
01:22:58,936 --> 01:23:00,242
I was protecting you!

1461
01:23:00,309 --> 01:23:02,929
Protecting me from what, Mom?
I'm not a 10-year-old boy anymore!

1462
01:23:03,001 --> 01:23:04,908
-That's still your mama, now...
-I got this!

1463
01:23:04,984 --> 01:23:08,116
No, no, no, no, you watch your tone.
You realize who you're talking to.

1464
01:23:08,184 --> 01:23:10,673
Mom, what is it that you want from me?

1465
01:23:10,744 --> 01:23:13,166
You want love? I'll give it to you.

1466
01:23:13,691 --> 01:23:16,026
-You want respect? I give you that, too.
-Respect?

1467
01:23:16,123 --> 01:23:18,095
Well, you haven't given me very much
of that this weekend.

1468
01:23:18,168 --> 01:23:22,199
How? Because the shrimp was cold
or your pies didn't make it on the menu?

1469
01:23:22,268 --> 01:23:24,436
Or because Sabrina
just doesn't wanna jump the broom?

1470
01:23:24,537 --> 01:23:25,969
It's her wedding, not yours.

1471
01:23:26,043 --> 01:23:28,726
Listen, you and that little girl
have been dating for six months.

1472
01:23:28,794 --> 01:23:30,736
She thinks she's too good
to come across the bridge,

1473
01:23:30,809 --> 01:23:33,558
-say hello to me?
-No, she doesn't. No, she doesn't.

1474
01:23:33,623 --> 01:23:34,772
I wouldn't let her.

1475
01:23:37,436 --> 01:23:38,712
-You?
-Yes.

1476
01:23:38,780 --> 01:23:40,208
Can you understand why now?

1477
01:23:40,509 --> 01:23:41,651
Look at what you've done.

1478
01:23:41,945 --> 01:23:46,420
Mom, every single woman
that I've let in my life,

1479
01:23:47,579 --> 01:23:50,230
you've driven 'em away
with your manipulations.

1480
01:23:51,196 --> 01:23:54,261
And I actually thought
Sabrina would be a little different.

1481
01:23:54,330 --> 01:23:56,440
But, no. You win.

1482
01:23:56,893 --> 01:23:58,680
-Jason...
-No, Mom, no.

1483
01:24:00,060 --> 01:24:04,883
You treat me like I'm either
a little boy or your husband.

1484
01:24:04,956 --> 01:24:06,779
And I'm neither.

1485
01:24:06,847 --> 01:24:09,084
I am a man and I am your son.

1486
01:24:10,427 --> 01:24:12,984
And I promised you
that I will always be here for you.

1487
01:24:14,266 --> 01:24:15,677
And that hasn't changed.

1488
01:24:16,955 --> 01:24:17,907
That hasn't.

1489
01:24:20,157 --> 01:24:22,905
But you have got to change.

1490
01:24:25,344 --> 01:24:26,714
You've got to change, Mom.

1491
01:24:39,136 --> 01:24:40,413
Excuse me.

1492
01:24:42,047 --> 01:24:43,129
Show's over.

1493
01:24:44,192 --> 01:24:45,370
Go about your business.

1494
01:25:31,782 --> 01:25:33,154
What was that?

1495
01:25:33,220 --> 01:25:35,163
-I didn't mean to say it.
-Yes, you did.

1496
01:25:35,240 --> 01:25:38,465
-I did not! It just slipped out!
-It slipped out?

1497
01:25:38,563 --> 01:25:40,058
You know you've been trying
to break up this marriage

1498
01:25:40,132 --> 01:25:41,477
ever since the beginning, you know that?

1499
01:25:41,575 --> 01:25:43,166
I feel terrible about this!

1500
01:25:43,173 --> 01:25:45,468
You ought to feel terrible
about this, Pam!

1501
01:25:45,734 --> 01:25:47,836
You know, it's real funny
how people like to apologize

1502
01:25:47,879 --> 01:25:49,211
after they do something bad.

1503
01:25:49,282 --> 01:25:50,628
It's real funny.

1504
01:25:50,853 --> 01:25:53,503
I see you sitting there
with your Bible. You praying.

1505
01:25:53,572 --> 01:25:55,262
Trying to make up with God?

1506
01:25:56,263 --> 01:25:58,017
If you wanna pray on something, Pam,

1507
01:25:58,629 --> 01:26:00,768
you better pray
that Jason get that girl back.

1508
01:26:01,059 --> 01:26:02,338
Pray on that.

1509
01:26:03,428 --> 01:26:05,055
And fix your wig on your head.

1510
01:26:10,375 --> 01:26:13,341
Sabrina, it's me.
Please tell us where you are.

1511
01:26:14,375 --> 01:26:18,116
We got your back, girl.
Just call, tell us what to do. Sabrina.

1512
01:26:18,183 --> 01:26:20,155
Ricky, I'm gonna go to the cliffs,
if you could go to the swings.

1513
01:26:20,260 --> 01:26:22,301
-And, Sebastian, you check State Beach.
-Got it.

1514
01:26:22,374 --> 01:26:23,553
Jason, where should we look?

1515
01:26:26,405 --> 01:26:27,488
Thank you, Shonda.

1516
01:26:28,135 --> 01:26:29,281
She could come with me.

1517
01:26:29,351 --> 01:26:32,513
Sebastian, didn't I tell you
that I wasn't trying to go to prison?

1518
01:26:32,581 --> 01:26:35,235
Look, woman,
this isn't about you and me.

1519
01:26:35,304 --> 01:26:38,852
This is about Jason and Sabrina, so
get in the car and help me find Sabrina.

1520
01:26:40,231 --> 01:26:41,182
Well, all right.

1521
01:26:41,257 --> 01:26:42,881
Look here. You chasing now?

1522
01:26:43,084 --> 01:26:44,933
Sell out your whole family
for this uppity chick?

1523
01:26:45,002 --> 01:26:46,560
This is not the time for this.

1524
01:26:46,632 --> 01:26:49,287
What's the rush?
Ain't nobody the best man now.

1525
01:27:35,468 --> 01:27:36,778
The guests will be arriving in an hour.

1526
01:27:37,997 --> 01:27:39,623
Should we start making the calls?

1527
01:27:39,693 --> 01:27:42,113
No. Not yet.

1528
01:27:59,247 --> 01:28:00,968
You know, when Daddy died,

1529
01:28:03,217 --> 01:28:04,588
I felt alone.

1530
01:28:07,569 --> 01:28:10,382
Like anything that went wrong,
it was up to me to fix.

1531
01:28:15,278 --> 01:28:16,653
Well, I can't fix this.

1532
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:22,215
I need you.

1533
01:28:25,327 --> 01:28:26,952
I need your help, God.

1534
01:28:31,089 --> 01:28:33,289
All I ask is
that you bring her back to me.

1535
01:28:38,833 --> 01:28:40,244
That's all I ask.

1536
01:28:52,402 --> 01:28:53,580
Sabrina?

1537
01:28:59,316 --> 01:29:00,294
Thank you for calling me.

1538
01:29:02,322 --> 01:29:03,566
Don't thank me just yet.

1539
01:29:07,668 --> 01:29:10,121
I know you just think
we're just all horrible.

1540
01:29:11,191 --> 01:29:14,156
And this may sound crazy,

1541
01:29:15,702 --> 01:29:17,971
but, chérie,
we didn't tell you because we love you.

1542
01:29:18,036 --> 01:29:19,731
It does sound crazy.

1543
01:29:22,196 --> 01:29:23,574
How could you lie to me?

1544
01:29:27,188 --> 01:29:30,156
What kind of woman just leaves her child
for someone else to raise?

1545
01:29:30,295 --> 01:29:32,271
I wasn't a woman.

1546
01:29:32,342 --> 01:29:33,771
I was a child.

1547
01:29:35,127 --> 01:29:37,067
Your Grand-Mère knew that.

1548
01:29:40,949 --> 01:29:43,500
But look at you, Sabrina.
You are beautiful.

1549
01:29:43,636 --> 01:29:47,795
God, you're smart. You're everything
I would've ever wanted you to be.

1550
01:29:49,142 --> 01:29:51,696
But I wouldn't have been able to
give you what Claudine gave you.

1551
01:29:53,364 --> 01:29:55,701
And I gave her hell about it, too.

1552
01:30:00,345 --> 01:30:02,031
And what about my father?

1553
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:11,125
I took this summer trip to France

1554
01:30:13,208 --> 01:30:15,414
and I met this gorgeous man.

1555
01:30:16,890 --> 01:30:19,129
We spent two weeks together

1556
01:30:19,195 --> 01:30:22,160
and we fell deliriously in love.

1557
01:30:22,841 --> 01:30:24,816
I mean, we planned to travel the world.

1558
01:30:26,998 --> 01:30:29,039
And then he told me
about his wife and kids.

1559
01:30:33,403 --> 01:30:39,416
I returned to the States
unmarried and pregnant.

1560
01:30:41,081 --> 01:30:42,901
So, they just cleaned up your mess.

1561
01:30:45,018 --> 01:30:46,330
Mom and Dad,

1562
01:30:47,901 --> 01:30:49,426
they just took me.

1563
01:30:49,919 --> 01:30:51,342
Is that what you're saying?

1564
01:30:52,892 --> 01:30:53,907
Yes.

1565
01:30:55,033 --> 01:30:56,053
Yes.

1566
01:30:56,795 --> 01:31:01,652
Sabrina, having you
was the greatest achievement of my life.

1567
01:31:03,515 --> 01:31:06,235
And not caring for you every day
was my greatest failure.

1568
01:31:08,287 --> 01:31:10,169
Don't let all this keep you
from your blessing.

1569
01:31:11,645 --> 01:31:14,941
You have a good man

1570
01:31:16,026 --> 01:31:17,939
who's looking for you.

1571
01:31:49,056 --> 01:31:50,515
You okay, baby?

1572
01:31:52,065 --> 01:31:54,301
I am so sorry.

1573
01:31:58,848 --> 01:31:59,992
You were right.

1574
01:32:01,088 --> 01:32:02,842
And I promise you
this will never happen again.

1575
01:32:02,910 --> 01:32:04,701
I spoke to my mom.
And if you just, please,

1576
01:32:04,768 --> 01:32:05,591
just give me another chance,

1577
01:32:05,592 --> 01:32:08,153
-I promise...
-Jason, no. I can't.

1578
01:32:09,214 --> 01:32:10,429
We can't.

1579
01:32:11,072 --> 01:32:13,048
Your mother ruined our wedding.

1580
01:32:14,403 --> 01:32:15,677
You're not the man I thought you were.

1581
01:32:16,198 --> 01:32:17,621
-Baby.
-And you didn't protect me,

1582
01:32:17,695 --> 01:32:18,781
-you didn't defend me.
-Sabrina...

1583
01:32:18,851 --> 01:32:20,923
Everything has changed.
My life has changed!

1584
01:32:20,993 --> 01:32:21,943
Sabrina?

1585
01:32:23,042 --> 01:32:23,988
Breathe.

1586
01:32:25,825 --> 01:32:27,483
Just breathe, baby.

1587
01:32:32,097 --> 01:32:33,276
Jason,

1588
01:32:35,204 --> 01:32:36,149
it's too messy now.

1589
01:32:37,636 --> 01:32:39,011
I don't know who I am.

1590
01:32:40,063 --> 01:32:41,442
How can I marry you?

1591
01:32:42,917 --> 01:32:47,456
Sabrina, you remember when you told me
that details are what make the person?

1592
01:32:48,260 --> 01:32:50,300
Well, here are some details.

1593
01:32:51,013 --> 01:32:52,702
Sabrina, you're an optimist.

1594
01:32:53,256 --> 01:32:55,775
Whenever anyone's having a bad day,
all you have to do is smile

1595
01:32:55,878 --> 01:32:56,858
and you bring them right back up.

1596
01:32:57,987 --> 01:33:00,193
And you taught me the value
of protecting our love.

1597
01:33:00,260 --> 01:33:01,505
And I know it was hard for you,

1598
01:33:02,982 --> 01:33:04,388
but you kept your vow to God.

1599
01:33:06,852 --> 01:33:09,341
Baby, that's who I fell in love with.

1600
01:33:10,085 --> 01:33:11,746
That's who you are.

1601
01:33:12,582 --> 01:33:14,178
That's who I love.

1602
01:33:16,357 --> 01:33:19,259
And, yeah, I know it's a mess,
but you know what, baby?

1603
01:33:20,039 --> 01:33:21,468
It's our mess.

1604
01:33:22,727 --> 01:33:23,773
Ours.

1605
01:33:27,080 --> 01:33:28,574
You left out one important detail.

1606
01:33:28,839 --> 01:33:30,216
What, babe?

1607
01:33:30,504 --> 01:33:31,809
I love you.

1608
01:33:42,921 --> 01:33:44,447
I love you, too.

1609
01:33:48,716 --> 01:33:49,759
Okay.

1610
01:33:50,405 --> 01:33:52,545
Will you please never
take this off again?

1611
01:33:53,352 --> 01:33:54,698
Pinky swear.

1612
01:34:02,088 --> 01:34:03,684
I hope our honeymoon's better than this.

1613
01:34:03,754 --> 01:34:05,348
I promise you.

1614
01:34:33,481 --> 01:34:36,038
Dear Sabrina, I'm sorry.

1615
01:34:37,098 --> 01:34:40,004
I feel sick
about how I behaved this weekend.

1616
01:34:40,077 --> 01:34:42,532
I was afraid of being alone.

1617
01:34:43,275 --> 01:34:46,125
I want you to have this broom
because it means more to me

1618
01:34:46,190 --> 01:34:49,003
than almost anything else in the world,

1619
01:34:49,418 --> 01:34:53,351
and I pray you and Jason
have a long and happy life together.

1620
01:34:54,543 --> 01:34:55,488
Pam.

1621
01:34:57,964 --> 01:34:59,559
Lord, give me strength.

1622
01:35:09,743 --> 01:35:10,921
Sabrina?

1623
01:35:12,206 --> 01:35:13,831
She's on the run again!

1624
01:35:13,903 --> 01:35:15,496
-What now? Please.
-Sabrina!

1625
01:35:16,782 --> 01:35:18,692
-Sabrina!
-Wait, wait!

1626
01:35:18,765 --> 01:35:20,491
-Where is she going?
-Wait!

1627
01:35:22,447 --> 01:35:23,943
Mrs. Taylor!

1628
01:35:26,381 --> 01:35:27,467
Sabrina?

1629
01:35:28,081 --> 01:35:29,025
Don't go, don't go!

1630
01:35:29,102 --> 01:35:30,665
-My goodness!
-Got your note.

1631
01:35:30,736 --> 01:35:32,109
Jason and I need you to be here, okay?

1632
01:35:32,176 --> 01:35:34,762
-Honey.
-All right? Come on.

1633
01:35:34,832 --> 01:35:36,719
Don't be silly now.

1634
01:35:36,817 --> 01:35:39,982
-Look at you! You look beautiful.
-Yeah?

1635
01:35:41,585 --> 01:35:43,309
-I wanna be here, too.
-Good.

1636
01:35:43,376 --> 01:35:45,166
-Here, let me get your gown.
-Thank you.

1637
01:35:45,234 --> 01:35:47,467
Sir, bring my bags! Bring my bags!

1638
01:35:47,535 --> 01:35:48,716
Come on.

1639
01:36:56,567 --> 01:36:59,052
-Love you, sweetie.
-I love you, too.

1640
01:37:00,950 --> 01:37:02,063
Jason.

1641
01:37:10,616 --> 01:37:11,565
Please be seated.

1642
01:37:14,778 --> 01:37:17,810
Who giveth this woman
to be married to this man?

1643
01:37:35,291 --> 01:37:36,272
-We do.
-We do.

1644
01:37:38,678 --> 01:37:39,696
Sabrina,

1645
01:37:40,923 --> 01:37:41,994
you've given me the clarity,

1646
01:37:42,137 --> 01:37:44,884
the strength,
and the wisdom to be a better man.

1647
01:37:46,681 --> 01:37:51,255
Jason, you make me happier
than anyone ever has.

1648
01:37:52,059 --> 01:37:55,638
I don't wanna live life unless you're
in it. You're my man.

1649
01:37:56,124 --> 01:37:57,649
-I love you.
-I love you.

1650
01:37:59,804 --> 01:38:01,975
Sabrina, Jason,

1651
01:38:03,033 --> 01:38:08,915
by the powers invested in me,
I pronounce you husband and wife.

1652
01:38:09,693 --> 01:38:10,871
You may salute your bride.

1653
01:38:11,035 --> 01:38:12,214
Come on.

1654
01:38:29,310 --> 01:38:30,967
I taught him how to kiss,
you know what I'm saying.

1655
01:38:31,038 --> 01:38:31,985
Ladies and gentlemen...

1656
01:38:33,565 --> 01:38:37,752
Ladies and gentlemen, brothers
and sisters, may I present to you...

1657
01:38:37,823 --> 01:38:38,772
Wait, I'm sorry.

1658
01:38:39,646 --> 01:38:41,110
Amy, come here.

1659
01:38:46,689 --> 01:38:47,635
There.

1660
01:38:53,347 --> 01:38:54,292
Thank you.

1661
01:38:56,093 --> 01:38:59,578
Ladies and gentlemen,
brothers and sisters, I present to you

1662
01:38:59,650 --> 01:39:02,943
Mr, and Mrs. Jason Edgar Taylor.

1663
01:39:39,010 --> 01:39:40,900
So, are you on Facebook?

1664
01:39:41,857 --> 01:39:42,843
No.

1665
01:39:43,363 --> 01:39:44,608
-Twitter?
-Nope.

1666
01:39:45,218 --> 01:39:47,074
Can I at least text you?

1667
01:39:47,140 --> 01:39:49,181
Sebastian, you're such a great guy,

1668
01:39:49,252 --> 01:39:52,284
but we're just in two different places
in our lives, and...

1669
01:40:01,573 --> 01:40:04,711
It's ShondaPeterkin@gmail.com.

1670
01:40:05,414 --> 01:40:06,687
Did Sebastian just...

1671
01:40:06,759 --> 01:40:09,245
Not your business, not your business.

1672
01:40:13,544 --> 01:40:17,536
You know, not a lot of men would've
raised someone else's daughter.

1673
01:40:18,692 --> 01:40:21,923
Not a lot of men
were lucky enough to marry you.

1674
01:40:23,465 --> 01:40:24,801
You still feel lucky?

1675
01:40:29,094 --> 01:40:30,980
You know I feel lucky.

1676
01:40:34,630 --> 01:40:36,868
This feels like the last hurrah.

1677
01:40:39,207 --> 01:40:42,308
So, we'll go to China on miles.

1678
01:40:43,620 --> 01:40:46,014
I am gonna miss the Four Seasons.

1679
01:40:46,662 --> 01:40:50,692
Well, I do have a rainy-day fund
for special occasions.

1680
01:40:51,752 --> 01:40:53,343
You kept it hidden from me?

1681
01:40:53,927 --> 01:40:55,932
Not all secrets are bad.

1682
01:40:56,360 --> 01:40:57,473
You

1683
01:40:58,539 --> 01:40:59,943
are smart.

1684
01:41:02,442 --> 01:41:03,870
And beautiful.

1685
01:41:19,403 --> 01:41:20,810
So, how much?

1686
01:41:21,325 --> 01:41:23,265
Wouldn't you like to know?

1687
01:41:23,657 --> 01:41:26,722
Yeah, I would. Maybe I'll invest it.

1688
01:41:29,996 --> 01:41:32,036
Excuse me! Hear ye, hear ye!

1689
01:41:33,546 --> 01:41:35,968
I'd like everybody's attention.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1690
01:41:36,043 --> 01:41:39,073
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like to say one thing.

1691
01:41:39,821 --> 01:41:42,121
I'd like to send a congratulations out

1692
01:41:42,188 --> 01:41:44,870
to the bride and groom,
the beautiful Miss Sabrina.

1693
01:41:44,939 --> 01:41:47,306
And, Jason, I'm proud of you, nephew.

1694
