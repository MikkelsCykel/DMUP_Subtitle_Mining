You've been sitting here

This is what happens
when you people move!

143
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:01,356
Jesus, this wasn't
supposed to happen!

144
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,486
- We shouldn't even be here!
- Shut the fuck up, bitch!

145

Oh, no, that's all right.

163
00:17:57,042 --> 00:17:58,634
l'm just...

164
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:01,542
so thankful
for what you tried to do.

165
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:04,874
l just reacted.

166
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:12,121
Real heroes like you, Liam,
are always humble.

167
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:14,954
They always say they just reacted.

168
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:55,232
<i>I feIt Iost, I feIt...</i>

169
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:58,566
<i>Confused.</i>

170
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,932
<i>I feIt I had no ChoiCes,</i>
<i>no options.</i>

171
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:07,738
<i>When a man is pushed,</i>

172
00:19:07,846 --> 00:19:10,872
<i>he wiII Commit aCts of vioIenCe</i>
<i>he normaIIy CouId not imagine.</i>

173
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:25,123
Cause of death...

174
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:28,824
Take your pick.

175
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:30,835
But...

176
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:35,134
l'm betting it's the frying pan
with the brains smeared all over it.

177
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:39,076
Maybe he was cookin' up
a freaky lunch.

178
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,440
lf he was, he would've, l'm sure,

179
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:47,485
used somebody else's brain
rather than his own.

180
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:49,178
Yeah, right.

181
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:51,256
We get an lD on this guy?

182
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,521
Yeah, Lynch McGraw.

183
00:19:57,563 --> 00:20:00,726
He had a rap sheet
longer than Florida.

184
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:02,231
The way he lived,

185
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:05,167
never any question
about the way he would die.

186
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,036
He's still somebody's son, right?

187
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,266
Well...

188
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,768
somebody's dead son, yeah.

189
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,244
l'm sure his family
didn't even like him.

190
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:18,272
Somebody's son.

191
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:21,714
lt's quite a mess, ain't it, sir.

192
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,084
Nothing l ain't seen before...

193
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:26,180
like Beirut.

194
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:28,350
Don't you want to know
about the perp, sir?

195
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:31,694
What'd you say?

196
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:32,957
The perp, sir.

197
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,966
Let's pretend for a second
that l'm not a complete idiot

198
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,695
after 30 years, okay?

199
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:40,203
And assume, if you will,
l've been around this place

200
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:42,296
one or two times already
ahead of you.

201
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:44,801
- You got it?
- Yes, sir.

202
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,901
And that l got
a long day ahead of me

203
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:48,912
because of some
pan-happy nut job

204
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:51,039
who likes to whack people
about the head!

205
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:53,174
- Can you pretend that for me?
- Yes, sir.

206
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:55,150
How dare you ask me
something like that!

207
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:58,087
Now, stop pretending it
and go get me a coffee.

208
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:01,187
lt's unbeliev--
These uniforms, they're idiots!

209
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:03,284
You're scaring people.

210
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:07,297
Scarin' peo--
Well, you're ogling a dead body.

211
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:09,060
ls that business or personal?

212
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:13,162
You notice the puncture wound
to the groin?

213
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,672
Yeah, l saw that,
but that was personal.

214
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:19,401
- You're a sick man.
- l'm hungry.

215
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:21,570
Hey, where's my coffee?

216
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,258
<i>Lieutenant CoIoneI</i>
<i>WaIter ''Cosmo'' JaCkson.</i>

217
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:37,686
<i>Did two tours in 'Nam with my dad.</i>

218
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:42,259
<i>When Dad died, Cosmo beCame</i>
<i>my obIigatory father figure.</i>

219
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:48,302
You can't be fucking serious.

220
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:52,169
They tried to kill me.

221
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:53,403
So?

222
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:55,910
Well, you think there's

223
00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:58,847
some kind of divine justice
around here, is that it?

224
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:02,284
You think you're
God's own avenging angel?

225
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:06,721
Well, l got news for you, kid.
lt don't work like that.

226
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,128
And don't talk to me about death

227
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:13,197
like l'm some dancer
that's never hit the floor.

228
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:20,162
Now, l understand you got
your grievances with these fools,

229
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:23,571
but you need to talk
to the police and air this shit.

230
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:26,867
Tell 'em you found out
who the cocksuckers are.

231
00:22:28,146 --> 00:22:29,511
lt's complicated.

232
00:22:30,315 --> 00:22:33,580
Christ, Liam, killin' a man
ain't never easy.

233
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:37,587
Now you just--
you just take a second here...

234
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:39,088
and think.

235
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:50,157
No. No police.

236
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:53,999
Maybe l did something
l shouldn't have, but...

237
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:55,630
what's done is done.

238
00:22:58,176 --> 00:22:59,871
Yeah, well, maybe you're right.

239
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,142
You go to the cops now,
they'll lock you up for life.

240
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:07,942
Maybe that's what you get--
what you deserve.

241
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:11,485
And then how true
would be my word?

242
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:16,092
l made your dad a promise
l'd do everything l could

243
00:23:16,194 --> 00:23:18,924
to keep you safe and clean,
same as he did to me.

244
00:23:24,202 --> 00:23:25,464
l need your help.

245
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:57,463
<i>Revenge.</i>

246
00:23:57,569 --> 00:24:01,096
<i>It's an airborne disease,</i>
<i>and it traveIs fast.</i>

247
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:25,723
We need to talk.

248
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:26,957
Why, man?

249
00:24:30,001 --> 00:24:31,628
l said we got to talk!

250
00:24:31,736 --> 00:24:33,033
l'm trying to get some.

251
00:24:34,206 --> 00:24:35,468
Take it easy.

252
00:24:39,177 --> 00:24:40,166
Get up.

253
00:24:41,213 --> 00:24:42,305
Beat it!

254
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,554
Let's go.

255
00:24:56,928 --> 00:24:58,054
What's up?

256
00:25:00,932 --> 00:25:02,763
Someone killed Skinner's brother.

257
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:06,896
l'm sorry, man.

258
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:11,568
What happened?

259
00:25:13,645 --> 00:25:14,839
He was beat to death.

260
00:25:15,881 --> 00:25:17,007
With a wok.

261
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:19,516
A what?

262
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:22,985
A wok. Chinese skillet.

263
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:29,359
Doesn't make any sense, though.
l mean, Lynch, he was...

264
00:25:30,662 --> 00:25:32,254
Who do you guys think it was?

265
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:33,854
Do the math. lt was Liam.

266
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:38,294
l ain't buying that shit.

267
00:25:38,403 --> 00:25:41,167
Not on his fucking
best day of his life

268
00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:42,740
is he gonna kill your brother.

269
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:44,809
No, l'm telling you,
he's unbalanced.

270
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:47,071
lf ''unbalanced'' means ''drunk''...

271
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:52,012
You know what, hero boy
was in the news for one minute,

272
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:55,382
and he hasn't seen
a single one of us since he came to.

273
00:25:55,487 --> 00:25:57,352
Yeah, there's a reason
for that, too.

274
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:02,282
'Cause he thinks one of you
are gonna hurt the girl.

275
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,726
You're a clever fucking boy.

276
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:06,854
Give yourself a round of applause.

277
00:26:06,965 --> 00:26:09,900
'Course he knows we're gonna
hurt the girl, but l'm tellin' you,

278
00:26:10,001 --> 00:26:14,563
freak show does not have
the juice to fuck your brother.

279
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:20,006
l sit here and l listen
to you guys chatter,

280
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:22,511
no facts coming out
of either one of you.

281
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:25,082
Only fact is
my little brother's dead.

282
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:29,182
Yeah, we'll fix it. We'll do it.

283
00:26:29,287 --> 00:26:30,686
Yeah, we will.

284
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:33,087
Let's say we go
to Liam Case's place.

285
00:26:33,191 --> 00:26:35,455
That's what you want?
That's a done deal.

286
00:26:47,305 --> 00:26:49,637
Shit. Shit.

287
00:26:56,247 --> 00:26:57,441
- Hi.
- Hi.

288
00:26:57,549 --> 00:27:00,109
lt's just me.
Are you busy?

289
00:27:01,152 --> 00:27:02,915
- Mind if l come in a minute?
- Sure.

290
00:27:03,021 --> 00:27:04,147
Thanks.

291
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,721
l'm sorry about the mess.

292
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:14,159
Please, don't apologize.

293
00:27:14,265 --> 00:27:16,460
l'm the one who should
be saying l'm sorry.

294
00:27:16,568 --> 00:27:20,436
- For what?
- For just... dropping by like this.

295
00:27:20,538 --> 00:27:23,302
l hate it when people come
to my house unannounced.

296
00:27:24,342 --> 00:27:25,809
l don't mind.

297
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:31,975
How is she doing today?

298
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:34,711
Oh, you know...

299
00:27:36,521 --> 00:27:38,216
What's it been, three months now?

300
00:27:39,924 --> 00:27:42,984
Three months without a change.

301
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:45,288
l'm sorry.

302
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:47,194
Oh, don't.

303
00:27:47,298 --> 00:27:48,663
Please, Liam.

304
00:27:49,968 --> 00:27:51,560
You didn't shoot her.

305
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:58,274
Hey, come here.
Have a seat.

306
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:05,176
l don't want to talk
about my daughter tonight.

307
00:28:06,918 --> 00:28:10,012
Seems like all l do
is talk about my daughter,

308
00:28:10,121 --> 00:28:11,645
think about my daughter.

309
00:28:11,756 --> 00:28:14,088
lt's like l don't... have a life,

310
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:15,921
you know,
of my own, you know?

311
00:28:18,063 --> 00:28:21,965
lt's like sometimes l...
think that l just wish she'd die

312
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:23,500
so that l could just carry on.

313
00:28:23,601 --> 00:28:24,727
Don't say that.

314
00:28:31,076 --> 00:28:32,202
Sorry.

315
00:28:36,181 --> 00:28:37,739
Most of the time l'm...

316
00:28:40,151 --> 00:28:42,346
l wish it was me that was dead.

317
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:48,823
l know how you feel, Melanie.

318
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:52,018
How could you?

319
00:28:55,266 --> 00:28:56,790
This is kind of embarrassing.

320
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:03,167
Would it be all right
if l spent the night here,

321
00:29:03,274 --> 00:29:04,866
you know, just for a little while?

322
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:06,934
Oh, yes.

323
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:09,878
Please, l really can't go back
to that empty house.

324
00:29:09,981 --> 00:29:10,970
l can't.

325
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:14,915
<i>MeIanie feeIs she's got</i>
<i>nothing Ieft to Iive for.</i>

326
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:18,380
<i>It's a feeIing I know aII too weII.</i>

327
00:29:30,969 --> 00:29:33,938
Oh, man, do we have work to do.

328
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:35,232
Yeah.

329
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:38,832
Now, first thing, turn off
the movie in your head.

330
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:41,434
Support the bottom of your gun
with the left hand.

331
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,311
Stop it from kicking you
in the face.

332
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:46,747
Now, you won't always
have time to use the sights,

333
00:29:46,851 --> 00:29:49,251
but whenever you can,
you use it.

334
00:29:49,354 --> 00:29:52,517
You drop a line down that bastard
and you squeeze.

335
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:55,354
Never pull it. Just squeeze.

336
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,586
Go ahead.

337
00:30:00,265 --> 00:30:01,732
Give me that thing.

338
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:10,567
That's how it's done.

339
00:30:10,675 --> 00:30:11,801
Yeah.

340
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:18,237
You know, the cops'll be looking
for whoever killed that guy.

341
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:21,750
He was a wannabe gangbanger
who lived in a grease pit.

342
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:24,219
There's probably 100 guys
wanting to kill him,

343
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:25,516
including the police.

344
00:30:25,623 --> 00:30:26,749
Yeah?

345
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:29,052
Load.

346
00:30:36,734 --> 00:30:37,860
Squeeze.

347
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:42,465
Better.

348
00:30:48,446 --> 00:30:50,380
No doubt, G,
she's a fine piece of ass.

349
00:30:50,481 --> 00:30:52,608
l'd wax this shit
till midnight next Thursday!

350
00:30:57,889 --> 00:30:59,857
You like that, you punk bitch?

351
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:03,828
Just 'cause you can't shoot
don't mean l can't, motherfucker.

352
00:31:03,928 --> 00:31:06,590
Stay off the court if you don't
own ball for the bizounce!

353
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:08,791
Fuck! Fuck.

354
00:31:10,668 --> 00:31:13,432
Come on, answer the fucking phone.
Answer the phone, man!

355
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:18,209
You motherfucker!

356
00:31:18,309 --> 00:31:20,209
Fuck your fucking head!

357
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:22,609
Don't you ever fucking die,
you motherfucker?

358
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,352
You want to die, motherfucker?

359
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:35,950
You're gonna fucking die!

360
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,618
Can't breathe, huh?

361
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,631
Oh, my dick!

362
00:33:10,555 --> 00:33:13,149
Hey, buddy, long time no see.

363
00:33:13,257 --> 00:33:14,986
What do you want?

364
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:19,856
Where's the love?

365
00:33:20,898 --> 00:33:23,492
Ain't you gonna invite us
into your little shithole?

366
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:26,092
l don't like people
stopping by unannounced.

367
00:33:26,204 --> 00:33:28,035
Cut the shit.
You know why we're here.

368
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:29,663
- Refresh my memory.
- Come on.

369
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:34,405
Fuck this.

370
00:33:35,747 --> 00:33:38,807
- lt was you, wasn't it, boy?
- l don't know what you talking about.

371
00:33:38,916 --> 00:33:43,285
- You don't know?
- Liam, is everything okay?

372
00:33:43,388 --> 00:33:45,322
Hey, the dude's got company.

373
00:33:45,423 --> 00:33:46,549
Liam?

374
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:48,854
Yeah, l'm fine.

375
00:33:50,428 --> 00:33:53,955
Okay, okay, you know
what we're gonna do here?

376
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:55,828
We're gonna talk tomorrow night.

377
00:33:55,933 --> 00:33:58,629
We're gonna go to the Razor Room.
Should feel safe there.

378
00:33:58,736 --> 00:33:59,964
lt's not my kind of place.

379
00:34:01,606 --> 00:34:04,097
lt's gonna be your kind of place.
You know why?

380
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:08,770
'Cause if you don't show,
l am gonna drive to the hospital

381
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,371
and l'm gonna go to Room 248

382
00:34:11,482 --> 00:34:14,349
and l'm gonna give my regards
to Kayla McQueen.

383
00:34:14,452 --> 00:34:15,578
Got that?

384
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:18,655
Haven't you caused her
enough pain?

385
00:34:18,756 --> 00:34:21,623
Hey, save it, save it.
Come on, man.

386
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:25,593
l haven't even started.

387
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,467
Haven't even started.

388
00:34:33,471 --> 00:34:34,631
Good night.

389
00:34:38,276 --> 00:34:41,643
Tomorrow, you crazy fuck.

390
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,552
Check out that chick over there.

391
00:35:01,532 --> 00:35:03,090
Look who's comin'.

392
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:05,602
Your cousins.

393
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:09,164
You're fucked.

394
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:13,176
- Fucking hell.
- What do you got?

395
00:35:14,512 --> 00:35:16,605
Nothing. Fucking nothing.

396
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,075
What's this?

397
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:21,374
Why, it's good to see you too.

398
00:35:22,653 --> 00:35:23,620
Things have changed.

399
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:25,586
Didn't we talk about this already?

400
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:29,683
We did. He's family, he's my cousin--
he's also Lynch's cousin too.

401
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,955
Fine, fuck it.
You don't need me, then.

402
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:34,423
Where are you goin'?

403
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:36,261
To find Liam.

404
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:37,732
And then what, tough guy?

405
00:35:41,772 --> 00:35:42,898
You're in as deep as l am,

406
00:35:43,007 --> 00:35:45,532
as deep as these guys are,
understand what l'm saying?

407
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:47,474
Let him go, Derek,
just let him go.

408
00:35:47,578 --> 00:35:50,206
Yeah, go bye-byes.
Bye bye bye bye!

409
00:35:55,019 --> 00:35:57,180
When it's over,
l'm gonna kill him.

410
00:35:57,288 --> 00:35:58,414
Fine.

411
00:36:00,591 --> 00:36:01,751
What's up?

412
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:02,985
What?

413
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:04,391
What's not convincing you?

414
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:07,328
Derek, how many fucking times
do l have to tell you?

415
00:36:07,431 --> 00:36:08,989
lt was fucking Liam.

416
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,761
You were with me in his apartment.

417
00:36:10,868 --> 00:36:13,530
That boy was laughing at us.
He was fucking laughing at us.

418
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:15,037
Lynch tried to kill him.

419
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:17,300
What would you do
if someone tried to kill you?

420
00:36:17,408 --> 00:36:21,174
l'm tellin' you,
he's not got the fucking juice.

421
00:36:21,279 --> 00:36:23,338
- l gotta take a piss.
- You go piss, yeah.

422
00:36:24,482 --> 00:36:25,744
Give me a smoke.

423
00:36:27,118 --> 00:36:28,915
- Listen.
- What?

424
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,716
lf l tell you to fuck up Swain,
you fuck up Swain.

425
00:36:31,822 --> 00:36:33,790
Don't you ever threaten him
in front of me again,

426
00:36:33,891 --> 00:36:35,119
'cause he's one of ours.

427
00:37:06,591 --> 00:37:08,821
Your brother died
with his dick in his hands too.

428
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:16,595
You're dead!

429
00:37:17,935 --> 00:37:19,197
Get up!

430
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:43,091
Fucker!

431
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:44,853
Cocksucker!

432
00:37:55,373 --> 00:37:57,170
You sick fuck.

433
00:37:57,375 --> 00:37:58,933
You sick fuck!

434
00:38:37,782 --> 00:38:39,044
Hey, did Case show?

435
00:38:40,084 --> 00:38:41,312
What do you think?

436
00:38:44,422 --> 00:38:45,912
Where's Skinner, man?

437
00:38:46,023 --> 00:38:47,217
Fuck Skinner.

438
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:17,746
Lynch, the guy that got
whacked with the pan?

439
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:20,415
They just found
his brother dead too.

440
00:39:42,646 --> 00:39:45,444
Marley, what are you doing here?

441
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:47,278
l came to see you.

442
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:48,682
Where have you been?

443
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:51,019
A friend's.

444
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:53,819
Same friend who beat you up?

445
00:39:55,826 --> 00:39:57,885
What, are you writing a report?

446
00:39:57,995 --> 00:39:59,724
What's your problem?

447
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:04,133
l'm sorry, it's just...

448
00:40:05,169 --> 00:40:07,797
lt's just kind of a bad time right now.

449
00:40:09,673 --> 00:40:11,504
What are you doing out
so late, anyway?

450
00:40:12,543 --> 00:40:15,068
- Mom's on a date.
- Yeah?

451
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:20,741
Well, maybe you should get home
before she gets back.

452
00:40:21,819 --> 00:40:23,150
You don't want me here?

453
00:40:24,221 --> 00:40:26,212
No, Marley, it's not that.

454
00:40:26,323 --> 00:40:30,760
lt's just... l got a lot of stuff
l'm sorting out right now.

455
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:34,993
You don't like me anymore?

456
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,361
You know that l do.

457
00:40:40,638 --> 00:40:42,731
You're like a little sister
to me, Marley.

458
00:40:45,576 --> 00:40:46,873
A sister?

459
00:40:47,912 --> 00:40:49,174
Yeah.

460
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,544
l don't think of you like a brother.

461
00:40:53,384 --> 00:40:54,510
You don't?

462
00:41:03,727 --> 00:41:04,853
Back up.

463
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:14,964
Marley...

464
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:19,368
if you were older,
you wouldn't think like that.

465
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:20,944
Yes, l would.

466
00:41:21,045 --> 00:41:22,808
l'm old enough to know what l think.

467
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:28,780
Marley, you're a pretty little girl,

468
00:41:28,886 --> 00:41:31,946
and l'm sure all the boys
are chasing you in school--

469
00:41:32,056 --> 00:41:34,354
l don't like the boys at school.

470
00:41:37,862 --> 00:41:40,854
Listen, Marley,
this really isn't the time for this.

471
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:43,727
Screw you, Liam.

472
00:41:55,613 --> 00:41:58,411
Yep, that went well.

473
00:42:02,052 --> 00:42:05,078
<i>When I saved MarIey,</i>
<i>I did it without knowing,</i>

474
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:07,657
<i>without seIfish motivations.</i>

475
00:42:07,758 --> 00:42:09,419
<i>I just reaCted.</i>

476
00:42:10,995 --> 00:42:12,622
<i>I saw someone in need.</i>

477
00:42:15,966 --> 00:42:17,797
<i>The worId had written me off,</i>

478
00:42:17,902 --> 00:42:21,269
<i>and yet I aCCompIished</i>
<i>something good in spite of it aII.</i>

479
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:27,136
Liam!

480
00:42:28,913 --> 00:42:30,380
l got this for you.

481
00:42:33,183 --> 00:42:36,880
<i>It's hard not to bask in it,</i>
<i>not to Iove every seCond of it.</i>

482
00:42:36,987 --> 00:42:39,353
<i>And so today,</i>
<i>on behaIf of this great City,</i>

483
00:42:39,456 --> 00:42:41,981
<i>I'm proud to present to Liam Case</i>

484
00:42:42,092 --> 00:42:44,322
<i>the highest honor we Can bestow.</i>

485
00:42:45,362 --> 00:42:48,627
Endangering yourself
to save the life of another

486
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:50,723
has more than earned our respect.

487
00:42:51,802 --> 00:42:56,239
So, Liam, please accept
this medal and plaque

488
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:58,808
in recognition
of your selfless valor.

489
00:43:00,544 --> 00:43:01,670
Thank you.

490
00:43:07,518 --> 00:43:10,316
l just want to say thank you for this

491
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:13,322
to all the firefighters and policemen

492
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:15,892
who do this on a regular basis,

493
00:43:15,993 --> 00:43:19,793
things far more courageous
or heroic than l could have...

494
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:23,064
l just want to say thank you.

495
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:24,293
Thank you.

496
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:37,376
Come on in.
Shut the door.

497
00:43:37,481 --> 00:43:39,745
- What are you doing?
- Shut the fucking door.

498
00:43:43,887 --> 00:43:47,118
Look, l know you got a gun,
so put it on the table.

499
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:02,263
This has got nothing
to do with her.

500
00:44:02,373 --> 00:44:04,238
Relax, man, l'm just here to talk.

501
00:44:04,341 --> 00:44:05,467
Have a seat.

502
00:44:19,023 --> 00:44:20,581
You been to any clubs lately?

503
00:44:26,363 --> 00:44:29,264
You want to stop this
before this goes too far?

504
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:31,460
l trusted you.

505
00:44:31,568 --> 00:44:33,798
Look at you, sitting there
all fucking righteous.

506
00:44:33,904 --> 00:44:35,201
You're a hypocrite!

507
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,800
Yeah, l screwed up,
l made a mistake-- l got that!

508
00:44:38,909 --> 00:44:41,901
l have to live with it,
but that's what l'm gonna do.

509
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:43,274
l'm gonna live with it.

510
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:45,280
Then why are you still here?

511
00:44:45,382 --> 00:44:48,818
Thirty-five divided by five
doesn't make me Donald Trump!

512
00:44:48,919 --> 00:44:50,648
Where the fuck am l gonna go?

513
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:54,348
Was it worth it?

514
00:44:54,458 --> 00:44:56,688
You didn't even
fucking know that girl.

515
00:44:58,062 --> 00:44:59,290
Who?

516
00:45:00,831 --> 00:45:01,957
Fuck.

517
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:07,932
Go ahead. Tell her.

518
00:45:10,274 --> 00:45:11,866
What? What girl?

519
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:14,834
Go ahead! Tell her.

520
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:17,779
- You're gonna have to shoot me.
- What?

521
00:45:19,616 --> 00:45:20,446
No!

522
00:45:30,794 --> 00:45:31,920
Fuck you.

523
00:45:35,799 --> 00:45:37,733
Guess we're all
going to hell, right?

524
00:45:43,173 --> 00:45:44,697
What's going on, Liam?

525
00:45:44,808 --> 00:45:46,400
Put the gun down, Melanie.

526
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:48,000
- Who was that?
- Nobody.

527
00:45:48,112 --> 00:45:49,340
Tell me.

528
00:45:49,446 --> 00:45:51,277
Just put the gun down.

529
00:45:51,381 --> 00:45:53,975
You tell me.

530
00:45:56,353 --> 00:45:58,287
He was involved in Kayla's shooting.

531
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:01,717
How?

532
00:46:01,825 --> 00:46:03,918
He was with those guys
at the bank that day.

533
00:46:06,029 --> 00:46:08,156
And how is it that you know him?

534
00:46:10,968 --> 00:46:12,663
That's a long story.

535
00:46:14,538 --> 00:46:16,028
l've got lots of time.

536
00:46:17,207 --> 00:46:19,072
My daughter's in a coma,
remember?

537
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,711
We used to work together.

538
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:27,075
And?

539
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:31,349
And l know those guys
at the bank too.

540
00:46:33,524 --> 00:46:35,082
Two of them are already dead.

541
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:40,320
Please make me understand.

542
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:43,956
lt's complicated.

543
00:46:54,611 --> 00:46:55,805
Don't touch me.

544
00:46:57,848 --> 00:47:00,749
You stay away... from me,

545
00:47:00,851 --> 00:47:02,876
and you keep away
from my daughter.

546
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:04,248
Whatever you say.

547
00:47:10,794 --> 00:47:12,625
You kill those bastards.

548
00:47:22,439 --> 00:47:23,838
Look, l didn't hear shit, man.

549
00:47:23,941 --> 00:47:26,933
lf l did, l probably thought it was
them backbeats we were tossing.

550
00:47:27,044 --> 00:47:29,569
You're telling me you didn't
hear or see anything.

551
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,545
Aside from the dead guy
in the bathroom?

552
00:47:31,648 --> 00:47:34,173
Yes, aside from the dead guy
in the bathroom.

553
00:47:34,284 --> 00:47:37,253
No, nothing out of the ordinary.
This is a club restroom.

554
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:40,482
Everybody's got a number one
or a two in them somewhere.

555
00:47:40,591 --> 00:47:41,922
He's got a point.

556
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:43,151
No, l'm serious.

557
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:46,627
Listen, ever since Bush bunny
let that ban on assault rifles expire,

558
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:49,665
it's like the ''Realm of Chaos''
in here, without all the tentacles.

559
00:47:49,766 --> 00:47:52,496
l was probably just in the next room
when it all went down.

560
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:55,868
Go ahead and go do
whatever you do.

561
00:47:55,973 --> 00:47:57,099
You sure?

562
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:00,509
l'm sure. Go.

563
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:04,479
Cool, bro. l hope you guys
catch your man, all right?

564
00:48:11,088 --> 00:48:14,649
McGraw family's dropping like flies
around here, Sub.

565
00:48:17,127 --> 00:48:20,688
lt's quite a coincidence,
two dead brothers.

566
00:48:20,797 --> 00:48:21,991
Yeah, right.

567
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:26,797
What are you thinking?

568
00:48:30,707 --> 00:48:32,868
That robbery at Star Financial.

569
00:48:32,976 --> 00:48:37,003
l mean, we found
that burnt-out car in the river.

570
00:48:37,114 --> 00:48:40,083
FBl ended up blaming those kids

571
00:48:40,183 --> 00:48:42,913
that were passing through
on a cross-country binge.

572
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:45,318
They pinned it on
those guys from Parkers--

573
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:47,117
l don't--

574
00:48:47,224 --> 00:48:49,749
l don't know.
l never really bought it.

575
00:48:51,361 --> 00:48:53,022
l don't know.

576
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:54,563
You know, l'm a pretty smart guy,

577
00:48:54,665 --> 00:48:57,099
but l don't have a clue
where you're going with this.

578
00:48:59,736 --> 00:49:01,465
Right now l'm going to Brett's.

579
00:49:01,571 --> 00:49:04,131
We'll have a few drinks
and meditate on this.

580
00:49:04,241 --> 00:49:05,435
Brett's.

581
00:49:05,542 --> 00:49:07,032
You ain't that smart.

582
00:49:13,717 --> 00:49:15,207
l didn't leave you much.

583
00:49:16,486 --> 00:49:17,612
You left me enough.

584
00:49:21,658 --> 00:49:22,886
Six in the corner.

585
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:31,326
What, are you scopin'
for a date or something?

586
00:49:31,435 --> 00:49:33,266
No, no, it's Liam Case.

587
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:36,602
Doesn't ring a bell. Should it?

588
00:49:36,707 --> 00:49:38,641
He saved that little girl

589
00:49:38,742 --> 00:49:41,677
and he helped that bank teller
over there at the bank.

590
00:49:41,778 --> 00:49:43,370
Oh, yeah.

591
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,971
Yeah, l remember.
Ace in the side.

592
00:49:51,221 --> 00:49:52,779
lt's just funny.

593
00:49:53,957 --> 00:49:56,084
One minute he's a hero
all over the news,

594
00:49:56,193 --> 00:49:58,821
next he's inside a bottle
with no exit.

595
00:49:59,863 --> 00:50:01,091
He's looking like Oedipus

596
00:50:01,198 --> 00:50:03,428
right after someone told him
he fucked his mother.

597
00:50:04,601 --> 00:50:07,832
Yeah, it's too late in the day
for Roman mythology, Sub.

598
00:50:08,872 --> 00:50:10,703
No such thing as Roman mythology.

599
00:50:10,807 --> 00:50:12,775
lt's a Greek tragedy, is what it is.

600
00:50:12,876 --> 00:50:14,070
Take you, for example.

601
00:50:14,177 --> 00:50:17,112
You're like a chimera.
You're half man, half pool shark.

602
00:50:17,214 --> 00:50:19,682
Miss one already!
Give a guy a shot.

603
00:50:21,451 --> 00:50:22,577
Get the fuck out of here.

604
00:50:23,253 --> 00:50:25,653
- Look.
- l know. l'm running him.

605
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:30,620
Shit. Come on, Brett,
what's the matter?

606
00:50:30,727 --> 00:50:32,422
Come on, man,
you see this mess?

607
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:33,655
You okay?

608
00:50:33,764 --> 00:50:35,197
Come on, come on.

609
00:50:36,233 --> 00:50:38,292
- You sure you're all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

610
00:50:38,402 --> 00:50:42,270
l just think happy hour
is over for me. That's it.

611
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:44,636
From the looks of things,
l'd say you're right.

612
00:50:44,741 --> 00:50:46,333
Okay.

613
00:50:46,443 --> 00:50:48,968
You're not driving, are you?
Want us to give you a ride home?

614
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:51,309
No, no, l'm just around the corner.

615
00:50:51,415 --> 00:50:52,780
Yeah, where's my keys?

616
00:50:54,151 --> 00:50:56,483
- l'm just bullshitting.
- You're not driving?

617
00:50:56,586 --> 00:50:58,417
l'm right around the corner.

618
00:50:58,522 --> 00:50:59,648
Thank you!

619
00:50:59,756 --> 00:51:00,882
Thank you, boys.

620
00:51:03,326 --> 00:51:04,554
You see the way he looked?

621
00:51:04,661 --> 00:51:07,687
He was in a fight,
and it wasn't just this guy.

622
00:51:07,798 --> 00:51:09,698
He was in a brawl with somebody.

623
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:10,926
You're right.

624
00:51:14,971 --> 00:51:16,666
Could be a coincidence, but...

625
00:51:20,777 --> 00:51:22,005
l'll have one of those.

626
00:51:32,189 --> 00:51:34,350
Liam Case.

627
00:51:35,826 --> 00:51:38,090
Want to try to put me
on your bitch list?

628
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:41,190
There is no list.

629
00:51:41,298 --> 00:51:43,323
Yeah? So how come
two of my buddies

630
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:45,367
are fucking in the morgue,
toe-tagged?

631
00:51:45,469 --> 00:51:47,630
Oh, man,
we've been through this shit.

632
00:51:47,737 --> 00:51:48,999
We been through this shit?

633
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:50,903
You want me to go
talk to your buddies,

634
00:51:51,007 --> 00:51:53,737
the guys with the badges,
tell them a little story?

635
00:51:53,844 --> 00:51:55,471
l got a pretty good one to tell.

636
00:51:56,546 --> 00:51:58,070
You know what?
You impress me.

637
00:51:58,181 --> 00:51:59,614
You shock and stun me.

638
00:51:59,716 --> 00:52:03,311
l mean, you did fucking Skinner,
which is very impressive,

639
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:04,546
but tell me something:

640
00:52:04,654 --> 00:52:06,485
how the fuck did
you do my buddy Lynch?

641
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:08,558
'Cause he can fuck
with the best of them.

642
00:52:08,658 --> 00:52:10,353
- What do you want, Derek?
- What do l want?

643
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:12,951
Well, you know what,
you're a big hero,

644
00:52:13,063 --> 00:52:14,621
and in every hero's story,

645
00:52:14,731 --> 00:52:17,723
there's always
a little damsel in distress.

646
00:52:17,834 --> 00:52:19,699
What the fuck
are you talking about?

647
00:52:20,737 --> 00:52:23,137
Marley. Think you can
save her again?

648
00:52:25,442 --> 00:52:26,773
- l'll kill you.
- Yeah?

649
00:52:26,877 --> 00:52:30,540
With the fucking cops in there?
Go ahead, motherfucker.

650
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:32,308
You stay away from her.

651
00:52:32,415 --> 00:52:33,643
Too fucking late.

652
00:52:35,285 --> 00:52:36,650
Where is she?

653
00:52:36,753 --> 00:52:38,744
Don't let me go,
you'll never fucking know.

654
00:52:41,858 --> 00:52:43,018
What are you doing, man?

655
00:52:43,126 --> 00:52:45,720
What am l doing?
Tell you what l'm doing.

656
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:48,354
Tomorrow, the factory
just off the highway,

657
00:52:48,465 --> 00:52:50,558
Andrew Street,
me and you there.

658
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:53,158
High noon.
Do some western stuff.

659
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:56,000
We'll go boom boom
and see who walks away.

660
00:52:56,106 --> 00:52:59,473
Marley, she's not in this, man.
lt's between us.

661
00:52:59,576 --> 00:53:03,137
She's a means to an end,
and if you're a second late,

662
00:53:03,246 --> 00:53:06,579
she ain't blowing no more
birthday candles out. Feel me?

663
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:10,478
Oh, fuck.

664
00:53:20,297 --> 00:53:23,095
<i>I wish I wouIdn't've survived</i>
<i>in the bank that day.</i>

665
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,997
<i>I wish they wouId have kiIIed me.</i>

666
00:53:49,526 --> 00:53:50,754
<i>He knew.</i>

667
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:52,623
<i>He knew aII aIong, probabIy.</i>

668
00:53:53,663 --> 00:53:55,824
<i>He knew I hadn't toId him</i>
<i>the whoIe story.</i>

669
00:53:57,367 --> 00:53:58,994
l thought we were finished.

670
00:54:01,037 --> 00:54:03,005
l don't have anywhere else to go.

671
00:54:08,311 --> 00:54:11,371
You know, l can't tell if there's
any good left in you, or...

672
00:54:14,217 --> 00:54:16,708
if you're just
plain rotten to the core.

673
00:54:19,222 --> 00:54:21,554
Sometimes l don't
even know myself anymore.

674
00:54:24,828 --> 00:54:26,420
There's still time, Liam.

675
00:54:27,497 --> 00:54:31,126
There's still time to put up the deck
before you play the final hand.

676
00:54:34,571 --> 00:54:36,505
Don't let this go any further.

677
00:54:40,543 --> 00:54:42,170
They got a little girl, Cosmo...

678
00:54:48,852 --> 00:54:50,342
and they're gonna kill her.

679
00:54:52,322 --> 00:54:53,516
l fucked up.

680
00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:02,625
Now, you listen to me, kid.

681
00:55:03,733 --> 00:55:06,998
l've already been
in one war that was a lie,

682
00:55:07,103 --> 00:55:08,798
and l don't want to make it two...

683
00:55:09,906 --> 00:55:13,239
so you better
start leveling with me now.

684
00:55:13,343 --> 00:55:14,469
Okay.

685
00:55:17,514 --> 00:55:18,640
Okay, okay.

686
00:55:26,589 --> 00:55:29,057
<i>I went to the Cemetery to see Dawn.</i>

687
00:55:33,897 --> 00:55:37,856
<i>I wanted to be with her again,</i>
<i>one more time.</i>

688
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:56,410
<i>But something happened.</i>

689
00:55:56,519 --> 00:56:00,979
<i>I Iooked, and there was this girI.</i>

690
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:09,362
<i>Just her very essenCe</i>
<i>reminded me of Dawn.</i>

691
00:56:32,989 --> 00:56:34,854
<i>I beCame obsessed.</i>

692
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:38,690
<i>She represented something to me,</i>
<i>something good,</i>

693
00:56:38,795 --> 00:56:40,695
<i>something that I had</i>
<i>that I had Iost.</i>

694
00:56:45,168 --> 00:56:47,466
<i>I needed it, I needed her,</i>
<i>I needed...</i>

695
00:56:48,505 --> 00:56:51,372
<i>I needed whatever</i>
<i>she represented baCk in my Iife.</i>

696
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:57,846
<i>But there's more.</i>

697
00:57:42,926 --> 00:57:45,622
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

698
00:57:48,865 --> 00:57:49,991
Can l help you, sir?

699
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:53,295
No, no, thanks. l'm fine.

700
00:57:53,403 --> 00:57:56,497
Window number three is open
if you'd like to make a transaction.

701
00:57:56,606 --> 00:57:59,871
Nope. No, l was just
actually leaving. Thanks.

702
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:02,001
- Okay. Have a good day, then.
- Yeah.

703
00:58:09,686 --> 00:58:10,812
Fuck.

704
00:58:36,379 --> 00:58:38,347
You hear what you're saying, man?

705
00:58:38,448 --> 00:58:40,416
You're talking like a crazy person.

706
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:42,246
Crazy people,
they talk like that.

707
00:58:43,286 --> 00:58:45,151
She's just a chick
you want to bone, man.

708
00:58:45,255 --> 00:58:48,088
No, man, no.
No, it's more than that.

709
00:58:49,325 --> 00:58:50,622
More than that...

710
00:58:51,728 --> 00:58:54,128
lt's insane, what you're
fucking talking about, man.

711
00:58:54,230 --> 00:58:55,891
Just talk to the girl.

712
00:58:55,999 --> 00:58:57,557
Come on, what've you got to lose?

713
00:58:58,601 --> 00:58:59,761
Everything.

714
00:59:00,904 --> 00:59:02,838
Right now l ain't got shit
to offer her.

715
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:05,135
You got your job.

716
00:59:06,276 --> 00:59:08,403
l'm a garbage man, man!

717
00:59:08,511 --> 00:59:10,945
So what?
Pays the fucking bills, right?

718
00:59:11,981 --> 00:59:13,380
lt's gotta be right--

719
00:59:13,483 --> 00:59:15,280
the moment, me, everything.

720
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:19,379
She's gotta know
that l can be more than this, man.

721
00:59:21,124 --> 00:59:23,217
That sounds
all romantic and shit, but...

722
00:59:23,326 --> 00:59:24,953
lt's the only way.

723
00:59:25,061 --> 00:59:26,494
That's the only way.

724
00:59:26,596 --> 00:59:29,724
l think your brain got burnt up
in that fire, that's what l think.

725
00:59:30,266 --> 00:59:31,756
You gonna help me or not?

726
00:59:32,802 --> 00:59:35,498
Could get in a lot of shit
for something like this, man.

727
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:38,666
Five grand.

728
00:59:38,775 --> 00:59:40,902
l'll give you $5,000.

729
00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:43,137
Five grand, that's it?

730
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:46,774
Come on, man,
l've known you a long time.

731
00:59:46,883 --> 00:59:49,852
Dude, l hang with you every day.
l don't know you at all.

732
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:53,445
l'm asking you as a friend.

733
00:59:53,556 --> 00:59:54,853
As a friend.

734
00:59:54,958 --> 00:59:57,256
Dude, if you had a friend,
which you don't,

735
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:59,487
they would not let you
go through with this.

736
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:01,359
l'm asking, man.

737
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:12,741
You know, America was built on labor.

738
01:00:14,677 --> 01:00:15,905
Look at this shit now.

739
01:00:16,946 --> 01:00:18,311
Yeah, it's real fucked up.

740
01:00:19,349 --> 01:00:22,011
My uncle, Sweet Dick Willy,
used to work in this factory here.

741
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:23,642
Now that nigga's on crack.

742
01:00:30,426 --> 01:00:31,552
Oh, shut up!

743
01:00:33,529 --> 01:00:36,293
Shut up!
Shut your mouth!

744
01:00:36,399 --> 01:00:37,866
- No!
- Get out!

745
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:39,935
- No, you can't!
- l said get out!

746
01:00:44,774 --> 01:00:45,900
Get away!

747
01:01:26,616 --> 01:01:28,015
How's this work, again?

748
01:01:30,253 --> 01:01:31,379
Come here.

749
01:01:31,487 --> 01:01:32,818
Listen, listen.

750
01:01:33,956 --> 01:01:36,652
You're just gonna scare
the hell out of everybody,

751
01:01:36,759 --> 01:01:39,489
all right, but in the end,
nobody's gonna get hurt.

752
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:41,929
How do we not get caught?

753
01:01:42,031 --> 01:01:44,363
Come on, man, listen.

754
01:01:45,401 --> 01:01:48,302
l did my research already,
all right?

755
01:01:48,404 --> 01:01:50,929
There's only one security guard
on Saturdays,

756
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:53,201
and he's an ex-traffic cop, all right?

757
01:01:53,309 --> 01:01:56,472
The cat takes a lunch break
same time every shift,

758
01:01:56,579 --> 01:01:58,604
and he's always gone
at least 40 minutes.

759
01:01:59,649 --> 01:02:00,775
So, wait...

760
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:04,910
l break in, you intervene,

761
01:02:05,021 --> 01:02:07,046
l get scared and run off,
that's it?

762
01:02:07,156 --> 01:02:08,919
The cops'll be on their way already.

763
01:02:09,025 --> 01:02:11,186
You won't have no choice
but to get the hell on.

764
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:18,693
Why me?

765
01:02:19,969 --> 01:02:21,800
Why you think you?

766
01:02:21,904 --> 01:02:23,599
You're the only one l trust.

767
01:02:31,647 --> 01:02:32,773
Wait, wait...

768
01:02:37,386 --> 01:02:38,580
Shut the fuck up, man.

769
01:02:38,688 --> 01:02:41,248
l can't understand your stupid ass.
Speak English.

770
01:02:42,291 --> 01:02:45,852
You're gonna tell me fuck off
and speak English, you dumb prick?

771
01:02:45,962 --> 01:02:49,489
l'm Scottish for a start,
you fag-looking motherfucker.

772
01:02:51,167 --> 01:02:52,725
Can l talk to you for a second, man?

773
01:02:52,835 --> 01:02:53,995
l'm a little busy.

774
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:55,468
lt involves money.

775
01:02:55,571 --> 01:02:56,697
lt always does.

776
01:02:56,806 --> 01:02:57,932
Not like this.

777
01:02:59,041 --> 01:03:01,100
You gotta go, you gotta go.

778
01:03:04,247 --> 01:03:05,714
l'm listening.

779
01:03:05,815 --> 01:03:08,375
That place we used to work--
can l meet you there tomorrow?

780
01:03:08,484 --> 01:03:10,349
Are you the pope
of Greenwich Village?

781
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:11,818
Why can't we talk right here?

782
01:03:11,921 --> 01:03:13,252
l just don't want him to hear.

783
01:03:13,356 --> 01:03:14,948
What the fuck's your problem?

784
01:03:16,292 --> 01:03:18,760
You still pissed 'cause my cousin
got you arrested?

785
01:03:18,861 --> 01:03:20,726
No, dick,
it's 'cause l don't trust him.

786
01:03:20,830 --> 01:03:22,422
That matters?

787
01:03:22,532 --> 01:03:24,090
Look, man, no Gordy, no job.

788
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:25,792
He's too fucking volatile.

789
01:03:25,902 --> 01:03:27,733
What the fuck
you gonna do about it!

790
01:03:27,837 --> 01:03:30,101
You know what,
he is a bit of a caveman.

791
01:03:43,152 --> 01:03:44,278
Tomorrow?

792
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:45,613
Tomorrow.

793
01:03:55,398 --> 01:03:56,888
l don't get it.

794
01:03:56,999 --> 01:03:58,830
Why doesn't he just talk to her?

795
01:04:00,002 --> 01:04:01,867
l said the same thing,
man, l don't know.

796
01:04:01,971 --> 01:04:03,768
What, is he fucking pussy-whipped?

797
01:04:03,873 --> 01:04:05,966
Shit, if a nigger
really wanted pussy that bad,

798
01:04:06,075 --> 01:04:09,169
wouldn't he just pay some ho,
say some dope?

799
01:04:09,278 --> 01:04:11,576
Swain, what are you
bringing me this shit for?

800
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:14,047
l ain't gonna take a fucking risk
like that by myself.

801
01:04:14,150 --> 01:04:16,584
$5,000 in a fake bank heist?
Give me a break.

802
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:22,184
l get it. This is about
the Caribbean for you, isn't it?

803
01:04:22,291 --> 01:04:24,691
Hula-hula, right?

804
01:04:24,794 --> 01:04:27,354
This is your chance
to put your Speedos on, hang out.

805
01:04:27,463 --> 01:04:29,055
This is your chance to own up.

806
01:04:29,165 --> 01:04:30,928
Liam did all this fucking homework.

807
01:04:31,033 --> 01:04:33,092
He knows all the security,
all that shit.

808
01:04:34,237 --> 01:04:36,603
l don't know about this, man.
A bank job? Come on.

809
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:38,196
That's fucking crazy.

810
01:04:38,307 --> 01:04:40,104
We could do
some serious time for that shit.

811
01:04:40,209 --> 01:04:41,801
Hang on a second.
l'm still lost.

812
01:04:41,911 --> 01:04:45,347
lf he's expecting you to do this
and we show up instead,

813
01:04:45,448 --> 01:04:47,473
he's gonna know that you sent us.

814
01:04:47,583 --> 01:04:49,414
What's stopping him
from going to the cops?

815
01:04:49,518 --> 01:04:51,042
He becomes an even bigger hero.

816
01:04:51,153 --> 01:04:53,519
Well, then we tell on him.
l don't fucking know.

817
01:04:53,623 --> 01:04:56,114
The last thing he wants
is for this to come back to him.

818
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:05,360
- Fuck it.
- Fuck it.

819
01:05:06,636 --> 01:05:08,160
- We're doing it.
- Let's do this.

820
01:05:08,271 --> 01:05:10,398
- You want to do this?
- Let's fucking do this.

821
01:05:10,506 --> 01:05:12,303
- Are you serious?
- Abso-fucking-lutely.

822
01:05:12,408 --> 01:05:15,468
You fellas complain about
the liquor stores, dollar stores.

823
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:19,275
With this, we won't get caught.
The penalties are the same.

824
01:05:19,382 --> 01:05:20,940
- Exactly.
- The payout's huge.

825
01:05:21,050 --> 01:05:23,450
You know how much money's
in that fucking bank?

826
01:05:23,552 --> 01:05:26,544
You want to make nickels and dimes
or fucking dollars?

827
01:05:26,656 --> 01:05:30,922
You can spend the rest
of your anorexic life on your pipe.

828
01:05:31,027 --> 01:05:33,552
Screw you, all right?
l was just fucking sayin'.

829
01:05:33,663 --> 01:05:36,928
All right, if l have to,
l'll take care of Case.

830
01:05:37,033 --> 01:05:38,660
What are you going to do
when it's over?

831
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:39,962
Soon as we get the money,

832
01:05:40,069 --> 01:05:42,435
l'm off on a fucking beach
somewhere.

833
01:05:44,540 --> 01:05:45,598
Get going.

834
01:05:45,708 --> 01:05:47,335
Don't forget your suntan lotion.

835
01:05:47,443 --> 01:05:49,434
Come on. Hey, come on now.

836
01:05:49,545 --> 01:05:50,876
Come on now. Hippity-scop.

837
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:53,005
Are you serious about this shit?

838
01:05:55,418 --> 01:05:57,386
<i>It was a simpIe pIan:</i>

839
01:05:57,486 --> 01:06:00,250
<i>Swain wouId make me</i>
<i>out to be the hero,</i>

840
01:06:00,356 --> 01:06:02,916
<i>I'd impress the girI,</i>
<i>and he'd make a IittIe money.</i>

841
01:06:03,025 --> 01:06:05,186
<i>It's obvious how stupid I was.</i>

842
01:06:05,294 --> 01:06:07,455
Yeah, so, lover boy.

843
01:06:08,497 --> 01:06:11,898
Think your nigga was gonna rob
a bank and not take any loot?

844
01:06:12,001 --> 01:06:15,300
Find someone else to feed
your heroic addiction, fucking faggot!

845
01:06:22,445 --> 01:06:23,571
<i>And forgive us our sins</i>

846
01:06:23,679 --> 01:06:25,943
<i>as we forgive</i>
<i>those who sin against us.</i>

847
01:06:26,048 --> 01:06:28,676
Lead us not into temptation;
deliver us from evil.

848
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:34,221
For thine is the kingdom
and the power and the glory forever.

849
01:06:34,323 --> 01:06:35,449
Amen.

850
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:40,394
<i>Turning away isn't an option.</i>

851
01:06:40,496 --> 01:06:42,464
<i>It is now up to me</i>
<i>to make things right...</i>

852
01:06:44,233 --> 01:06:45,427
<i>whatever the Cost.</i>

853
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:53,400
He's been in and out of trouble
since he was a kid.

854
01:06:53,509 --> 01:06:56,273
Dad got killed in Vietnam,
Mom was a junkie,

855
01:06:56,379 --> 01:06:58,540
and then somehow
he gets his life together,

856
01:06:58,647 --> 01:07:00,672
gets married, has a good job.

857
01:07:00,783 --> 01:07:02,080
Listen to this.

858
01:07:02,184 --> 01:07:04,084
He's driving along with his wife,

859
01:07:04,186 --> 01:07:06,086
bus driver has a heart attack,

860
01:07:06,188 --> 01:07:08,656
hits the car,
they end up in the pond.

861
01:07:08,758 --> 01:07:10,817
She drowns while
he's trying to save her,

862
01:07:10,926 --> 01:07:12,894
and on top of it, she was pregnant.

863
01:07:12,995 --> 01:07:15,793
Jesus Christ,
this guy's had a shitty life.

864
01:07:17,266 --> 01:07:20,292
lt doesn't change the fact
that we got two dead guys,

865
01:07:20,403 --> 01:07:21,631
he looks like hell...

866
01:07:21,737 --> 01:07:23,602
You see that mark around his neck?

867
01:07:23,706 --> 01:07:25,640
Matches the wire
from Lynch's garage.

868
01:07:25,741 --> 01:07:28,073
l know. We gotta bring him in.

869
01:07:28,177 --> 01:07:29,303
l know.

870
01:07:32,415 --> 01:07:35,145
Everything's gonna be
all right, okay? l promise.

871
01:07:35,251 --> 01:07:37,310
You just got caught up
in the middle of some shit.

872
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:39,183
lt'll be over really soon, okay?

873
01:07:39,288 --> 01:07:40,880
What you doing there, stud muffin?

874
01:07:41,924 --> 01:07:43,721
Trying to make her
your little girlfriend?

875
01:07:43,826 --> 01:07:45,191
l'm just talking to her.

876
01:07:45,294 --> 01:07:48,127
There's 900 numbers
for that kind of shit.

877
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:49,857
You cryin'?

878
01:07:49,965 --> 01:07:53,457
'Cause you become a liability,
and l'll kill you myself.

879
01:07:57,640 --> 01:07:59,733
Don't worry about him.
lt's gonna be okay.

880
01:07:59,842 --> 01:08:01,571
Okay, don't worry.

881
01:08:04,947 --> 01:08:06,073
lt's all right.

882
01:08:06,182 --> 01:08:07,308
Okay?

883
01:08:12,455 --> 01:08:14,446
l'm gonna make sure
l get you out of here.

884
01:08:22,731 --> 01:08:26,064
Don't worry, all right?
lt's gonna be okay. 'Kay?

885
01:08:27,870 --> 01:08:30,498
When we're done with Liam,
what do we do with the little girl?

886
01:08:31,540 --> 01:08:33,201
What do you think
we're gonna do with her?

887
01:08:34,243 --> 01:08:35,574
Christ, we can't kill her.

888
01:08:36,312 --> 01:08:38,143
Aye, so you have
a better suggestion?

889
01:08:38,247 --> 01:08:40,715
Yeah, l can fucking think
of 50 of them.

890
01:08:40,816 --> 01:08:44,047
Swain, you're the one who brought
us this shit in the first place.

891
01:08:44,153 --> 01:08:46,451
No, l never told you to take the girl.
l never said that.

892
01:08:47,490 --> 01:08:49,287
What are you lacking?

893
01:08:49,391 --> 01:08:52,019
ls it brain cells or is it <i>Cojones,</i>

894
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:55,120
because the only people who seem
to have any is me and Gordy.

895
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:02,596
Shit.

896
01:09:06,208 --> 01:09:08,608
Tighten up, boys, he's here!

897
01:09:44,413 --> 01:09:45,937
Here we go!

898
01:09:50,819 --> 01:09:54,050
Look who we have!
The frickin' hero.

899
01:09:56,692 --> 01:09:59,422
Throw the gun to the floor,
please. Do you mind?

900
01:10:05,267 --> 01:10:07,462
Tough guy, the hero.

901
01:10:08,771 --> 01:10:09,897
Thank you.

902
01:10:12,741 --> 01:10:14,140
You okay, Marley?

903
01:10:19,548 --> 01:10:20,845
Marley's fine.

904
01:10:20,950 --> 01:10:22,611
We're looking after her.

905
01:10:22,718 --> 01:10:25,949
We were waiting for you to get here

906
01:10:26,055 --> 01:10:28,216
so we could fuck her up.

907
01:10:31,493 --> 01:10:33,256
You said you'd let her go.

908
01:10:35,598 --> 01:10:36,860
Let her go.

909
01:10:36,966 --> 01:10:40,629
Case, listen, she saw my face,

910
01:10:40,736 --> 01:10:42,897
she saw my boys' faces.

911
01:10:43,005 --> 01:10:46,202
What do you want me to do,
let her walk out of here?

912
01:10:49,311 --> 01:10:51,506
l'm not gonna let you
kill a fucking kid, man.

913
01:10:54,650 --> 01:10:56,413
Hey, Swain!

914
01:10:56,518 --> 01:10:58,509
We've been
through this shit already.

915
01:10:58,621 --> 01:11:00,646
We've discussed this.

916
01:11:00,756 --> 01:11:04,089
lt's all been discussed.
What's wrong with you?

917
01:11:05,794 --> 01:11:07,318
Fuck you, asshole.

918
01:11:07,429 --> 01:11:09,329
- Gordy!
- Yo!

919
01:11:09,431 --> 01:11:10,989
Do me a favor.

920
01:11:12,101 --> 01:11:16,401
Can you put your gun
on this prick

921
01:11:16,505 --> 01:11:19,338
and show him
the error of his ways?

922
01:11:21,010 --> 01:11:23,672
Otherwise, l'm gonna
have to climb up there

923
01:11:23,779 --> 01:11:25,974
and bitch-slap that little faggot.

924
01:11:28,851 --> 01:11:31,046
Hey, Liam, fuck you.

925
01:11:37,559 --> 01:11:38,287
Derek!

926
01:11:43,999 --> 01:11:45,591
Who the fuck was that?

927
01:11:50,339 --> 01:11:53,900
Liam, l told you
to come on your own!

928
01:12:14,029 --> 01:12:14,996
Fuck!

929
01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:24,571
Gordy! Cover Case!

930
01:12:25,607 --> 01:12:28,974
Somebody find the bitch
who shot me in the shoulder.

931
01:12:40,456 --> 01:12:43,186
Fuck. Do something,
you fucking pussy!

932
01:12:47,629 --> 01:12:49,096
Motherfucker!

933

Fuck!

934
01:12:59,608 --> 01:13:02,008
Hey, if you don't stop
fucking with me,

935
01:13:02,111 --> 01:13:05,945
l'll kill this little bitch right now,
l swear to Christ!

936
01:13:07,883 --> 01:13:09,009
No!

937
01:13:17,493 --> 01:13:19,620
l'm gonna get you
out of here right now.

938
01:13:28,337 --> 01:13:30,897
Where are you,
you son of a bitch?

939
01:13:36,945 --> 01:13:38,845
Stop firing at me!

940
01:13:38,947 --> 01:13:41,541
Then fucking kill somebody!

941
01:13:53,162 --> 01:13:54,629
Get away from her!

942
01:13:54,730 --> 01:13:55,856
Enough! Enough!

943
01:13:58,467 --> 01:14:00,332
No!

944
01:14:01,603 --> 01:14:03,901
No, Gill, no!

945
01:14:06,308 --> 01:14:08,105
Cosmo!

946
01:14:37,039 --> 01:14:38,131
Fuck.

947
01:15:04,666 --> 01:15:05,792
lt's okay.

948
01:15:17,379 --> 01:15:18,846
Come on, over here.

949
01:15:20,883 --> 01:15:23,750
Drop your weapon!
Put your hands in the air now!

950
01:15:30,359 --> 01:15:32,486
Put the weapon down!

951
01:15:37,399 --> 01:15:39,560
Drop the damn weapon!

952
01:15:41,803 --> 01:15:42,929
Now!

953
01:16:07,863 --> 01:16:09,057
Come on!

They're inside!

957
01:16:31,753 --> 01:16:32,879
lnside there.

958
01:16:36,191 --> 01:16:38,921
Oh, man, these guys need help.
l'll call the paramedic.

959
01:16:39,962 --> 01:16:41,691
- l'm going after them.
- All right.

960
01:16:47,836 --> 01:16:50,066
Listen, l need you
to stay here, okay?

961
01:16:50,172 --> 01:16:51,605
l need you to stay right here.

962
01:17:58,874 --> 01:18:00,341
Damn, boy!

963
01:18:00,442 --> 01:18:02,307
l thought you had me there!

964
01:19:17,586 --> 01:19:19,451
l love America...

965
01:19:20,489 --> 01:19:22,650
but l fucking hate cops!

966
01:19:29,097 --> 01:19:32,328
What you gonna do with that,
throw it?

967
01:19:32,434 --> 01:19:34,402
l'll deal with you in a minute.

968
01:20:12,207 --> 01:20:13,333
Don't move, Liam.

969
01:20:16,178 --> 01:20:17,543
Don't twitch a muscle.

970
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:23,411
How long have you known?

971
01:20:25,220 --> 01:20:26,482
l've had my suspicions.

972
01:20:27,522 --> 01:20:29,217
My intuition told me.

973
01:20:32,093 --> 01:20:33,788
l'm not going with you.

974
01:20:37,432 --> 01:20:38,865
You might've just saved my ass,

975
01:20:38,967 --> 01:20:40,491
but if you think
you're going someplace,

976
01:20:40,602 --> 01:20:42,433
you've got another think coming.

977
01:20:44,873 --> 01:20:46,431
l have to see her.

978
01:20:48,910 --> 01:20:51,435
l thought you were
one of the good guys, Liam.

979
01:20:53,515 --> 01:20:54,675
So did l.

980
01:20:56,618 --> 01:20:58,586
- Jesus.
- Marley.

981
01:20:58,687 --> 01:21:00,052
l want you to go, Liam.

982
01:21:00,155 --> 01:21:03,420
Hey, Marley, give me the gun.

983
01:21:03,525 --> 01:21:04,958
Give me the gun, sweetheart.

984
01:21:05,727 --> 01:21:08,161
Take it easy, easy, easy!

985
01:21:08,263 --> 01:21:10,322
Easy! Easy.

986
01:21:10,432 --> 01:21:12,195
Just give me the gun.

987
01:21:12,300 --> 01:21:13,995
Not until Liam's gone.

988
01:21:15,937 --> 01:21:18,770
Liam's not going anywhere,
okay, sweetheart?

989
01:21:18,874 --> 01:21:20,535
Put the gun down.

990
01:21:20,642 --> 01:21:22,633
He's not going anywhere.
Tell her.

991
01:21:22,744 --> 01:21:24,735
- Marley.
- Tell her.

992
01:21:25,780 --> 01:21:27,680
You saved my life, Liam.

993
01:21:28,950 --> 01:21:30,110
You saved my life!

994
01:21:32,287 --> 01:21:34,482
And this is your chance.

995
01:21:34,589 --> 01:21:37,057
Do whatever it is you have to,
but this is it.

996
01:21:38,693 --> 01:21:42,493
l'm giving it to you,
same as you did for me.

997
01:21:43,865 --> 01:21:46,333
You're like a little sister
to me, Marley.

998
01:21:48,703 --> 01:21:50,295
Always.

999
01:21:51,273 --> 01:21:52,797
Always.

1000
01:21:55,744 --> 01:21:56,972
Come here.

1001
01:21:59,948 --> 01:22:01,074
No!

1002
01:22:03,518 --> 01:22:05,247
Give me the gun.
Give me the gun.

1003
01:22:10,325 --> 01:22:11,553
l'm sorry.

1004
01:22:12,827 --> 01:22:16,786
l'm sorry.
l didn't want you to hurt him.

1005
01:22:18,366 --> 01:22:20,630
l wanted him to be safe.

1006
01:22:20,735 --> 01:22:22,293
lt's okay. lt's okay.

1007
01:23:31,606 --> 01:23:33,938
Security, there's a man
with a gun in the lobby.

1008
01:23:47,422 --> 01:23:49,652
Liam, oh! Oh, my God!

1009
01:23:49,758 --> 01:23:51,726
No, no!

1010
01:23:53,461 --> 01:23:56,362
She's awake.
She's awake, Liam!

1011
01:23:56,464 --> 01:23:58,125
She's awake!

1012
01:25:42,670 --> 01:25:44,763
l'm sorry. l'm so sorry.

1013
01:25:51,579 --> 01:25:52,705
Liam.

1014
01:25:57,886 --> 01:25:59,217
lt's over.

1015
01:26:04,092 --> 01:26:07,061
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

1016
01:26:47,402 --> 01:26:48,926
God! Help!

1017
01:26:51,472 --> 01:26:54,600
Hey! Help me! Help!

1018
01:28:03,544 --> 01:28:05,876
<i>Redemption. It's a funny thing.</i>

For what?

1022
01:28:43,084 --> 01:28:44,676
For saving my life.

1023
01:28:49,524 --> 01:28:51,355
This is only the beginning.
