1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
DYING BREED (2008)

2
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:17,171
Run, you bastard!

3
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:20,374
I think I see something there.

4
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:23,349
Over there!

5
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,514
Come on!

6
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,114
Let go the dogs!

7
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:41,730
Get onto him.

8
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:51,809
There!

9
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:54,506
Let's go, then!
Down you go!

10
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:08,120
Hold fast, you Irish shit!

11
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:13,359
So you thought you'd leave hell, would you?.

12
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:15,867
Timmy! I have Pearce!

13
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:18,028
Timmy!

14
00:02:18,104 --> 00:02:20,902
Your hands, get 'em up!

15
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,339
Up!

16
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:25,434
Well, as you will.

17
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:28,413
Irish are all the same.

18
00:03:03,249 --> 00:03:04,238
Over there!

19
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:46,549
You okay?.

20
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,553
Yeah. I'm good.

21
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,651
You sure your friend is fine with this?.

22
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:57,423
Yeah.

23
00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:59,522
Jack's an old mate.

24
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:03,859
Plus, I told him his picture would be
plastered across the front page

25
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:07,372
of every newspaper in the country
if he helped us find this tiger, so...

26
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,839
That's if we find it.

27
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:11,399
A small detail.

28
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,370
I can't wait to meet him.

29
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:21,043
Hey.

30
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:24,220
Yeah, I know. Relax.

31
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:27,851
- Yes.
- I'm good. I'm excited.

32
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:28,916
Good.

33
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:48,747
Wow! You look the same.

34
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:51,215
Obviously been working it off.

35
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:53,411
I'm proud of you, mate.

36
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:55,818
You know, we grew up as neighbors.

37
00:05:55,888 --> 00:05:57,116
Did everything together.

38
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,817
Yeah, I heard.

39
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:00,358
Not everything.

40
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:02,952
So this trip of ours-

41
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:07,798
Let's agree on 60/40?.

42
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:12,628
- 60/40-
- All right, 50/50.

43
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:15,401
But that includes marketing rights.

44
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,310
What?.

45
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,971
Oi!

46
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:26,618
Go easy, mate.
This trip means a lot to her.

47
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:28,017
I'm doing her a favor, remember?.

48
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:29,952
Yeah, you are.
It's just her sister.

49
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:32,217
- Remember?.
- That was ages ago.

50
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,156
That was eight years ago,
which isn't long.

51
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,661
This is the same trip--
Just be aware.

52
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:37,787
That's all I'm saying.
Be sensitive.

53
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:39,195
Okay. Hey, I'm Mr. Sensitive.

54
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:40,254
- All right?.
- Okay.

55
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,493
Does she swallow?.

56
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,501
Is this it?.

57
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:44,627
Yeah, absolutely.

58
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:47,899
Plenty of room for the four of us.

59
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:49,805
Who's the fourth?.

60
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:51,776
Rebecca.

61
00:06:51,844 --> 00:06:53,436
Who's Rebecca?.

62
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:55,811
You didn't expect it to be
just the three of us, did you?.

63
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:58,316
I mean, that would be like traveling
with my parents, for fuck's sake.

64
00:06:58,384 --> 00:06:59,373
Come on.

65
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:02,045
Yeah.

66
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:03,816
Nina, shotgun.

67
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,482
Get in the back.

68
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:06,814
God, it's beautiful.

69
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:10,219
Still pinching myself
we finally made it here.

70
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:12,189
Beats sitting in a real estate
office all day.

71
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:13,953
That bad, is it?.

72
00:08:14,026 --> 00:08:15,687
No.

73
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:17,092
Hey, how long was your sister here?.

74
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,791
About two years.

75
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:24,029
She kind of fell off the radar

76
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:26,333
towards the end there, so-

77
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,541
Hey, Nina, there's money
to be made, isn't there?.

78
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:37,480
If you can prove that this tiger exists.

79
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,074
Is that true, Nina?.

80
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:40,641
I'm not going to bite.

81
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:44,315
A local paper offered
over a million dollars, apparently.

82
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:47,723
Mind you, though, if we do find this thing,
we probably won't recognize it

83
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:49,727
because it'll be so fucking inbred.

84
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:51,456
You're full of it.

85
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,091
- Do you have an "off' switch?.
- Mm-hmm. Right here.

86
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:58,369
So which drop we heading for again, mate?.

87
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:01,429
I think it's this one.

88
00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:03,236
Hang on. Is it-

89
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:04,970
Maybe it's this one.
No, no, no

90
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,443
We're not lost yet.

91
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:13,842
Must be weird, though-

92
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,218
following your sister here after so long.

93
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:18,280
Yeah.

94
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:20,587
I just want to finish what she started.

95
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,252
You know?.

96
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:30,769
Well, Pieman River.

97
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:32,770
Welcome.

98
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:35,467
- Nothing.
- Oh, yes.

99
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,702
- We must have arrived, then.
- The house of serenity.

100
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:51,885
Oi! Tasmania!
You awake?.

101
00:09:56,228 --> 00:09:57,490
Right here.

102
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:09,240
Thank you.

103
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:10,366
Thank you.

104
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,411
Done a little bit of acting in my time.

105
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,342
I got to wee.

106
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:17,439
Watch out for leeches.

107
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:19,347
You know, I could've been
in Thailand with Emily.

108
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:21,545
You would have missed me too much.

109
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:22,918
Need a hand?.

110
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:44,567
Hey, sis, come here.

111
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,524
No teeth.

112
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:05,590
Hey! They're here.

113
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:19,301
Check out the color.

114
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:23,647
What is it, rust?.

115
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:24,774
It's not rust.

116
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:28,553
Looks more like blood.

117
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:32,685
Yeah, right.

118
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,199
Come on.

119
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,851
Fuck!

120
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:24,042
Jeez!

121
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:32,184
You all right?.

122
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,650
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

123
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:35,846
We're going to drive the car up.

124
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,786
Oi! Oi!

125
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:39,518
I'm okay.

126
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:42,220
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Fuck.
- You're going to do it?.

127
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:44,057
- All right. Don't scratch it.
- Oh, God.

128
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,654
She's definitely always on top.

129
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:47,289
You don't get a say ever, do ya?.

130
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:54,235
Steady. Oh, God.

131
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:58,507
Okay, okay, okay.

132
00:12:58,577 --> 00:13:00,374
Yep.

133
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:03,108
All right. Straight up.

134
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:11,923
- Great.
- Well done.

135
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,566
It's a freakin' antique!
Look at her go.

136
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:25,860
Hey, tell them about your idea for a bridge.

137
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:28,133
Yeah.

138
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:36,381
What's with the water?.
Why's it look like blood?.

139
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:38,643
Blood?.

140
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:40,344
That's tannin.

141
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:56,729
Said the pieman to Simple Simon...

142
00:13:56,802 --> 00:13:58,702
Hi.

143
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:01,467
- Simple Simon...
- What are those?.

144
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:07,069
Simple Simon met the pieman
playing with a knife.

145
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:09,614
Said Simple Simon to the pieman,

146
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,741
"Will you take my life??'

147
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:15,714
That's a nice rhyme.

148
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:22,058
Can I have a look at those?.

149
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:23,492
Shit! She bit me!

150
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:25,587
Yeah, well, pick on
someone your own size.

151
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:28,326
- I'm bleeding!
- Wheelhouse! Now!

152
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,526
Which is fine.

153
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:31,467
It's her boat and I'm a guest.

154
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:02,658
You know, they made
a whole X-Files series

155
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,498
on people like that.

156
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,969
Freaks.

157
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:08,501
Freaks!

158
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:18,816
Measuring 6 foot from tail to hood,
it was a formidable pest.

159
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:22,012
This, supposedly, is the last
known footage of the tiger

160
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:23,714
since it was hunted to extinction.

161
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:24,847
Hey. Hey.

162
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:28,860
However, unconfirmed sightings
in Western Tasmania

163
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,419
have cast doubt that, in fact,
the tiger's extinct at all--

164
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:34,489
This is all very interesting,
but nothing new.

165
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:36,557
I see no reason to fund your proposal.

166
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:38,034
To the right!

167
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:39,570
If you'll take a look at this--

168
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:41,333
What, precisely, are we looking at?.

169
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:43,238
A paw print.

170
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:45,334
1 6 separate points of reference.

171
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:48,039
As you can see, it's a perfect match.

172
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,671
Come on!

173
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:51,943
And where did you source
this one from, the Net?.

174
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,386
My sister took it.

175
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:09,327
You all right?.

176
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:11,426
You lost anything?.

177
00:16:11,503 --> 00:16:15,132
Yeah. My desire to have children.

178
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:17,607
She tried to eat me alive.
Look at that.

179
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:20,577
What do you want me to do?.
Do you want me to kiss it better?.

180
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,307
Yes.

181
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:24,144
Shite!

182
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:25,911
Look out! Look out!

183
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:29,617
- Any damage?.
- Better not be any fuckin' damage.

184
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:32,282
Jack, calm down.
She didn't hit anything.

185
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:33,416
Didn't you see him coming?.

186
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:34,925
He came out of nowhere, Jack.

187
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,723
Don't blame me.

188
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:39,389
Let's not lose the plot. Everyone.

189
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:41,524
I mean, you were the one driving, Nina.

190
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,830
You ever heard of a rearview
fucking mirror?.

191
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:45,062
I swear it was a car.

192
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:48,504
Look, why don't we just get to the town
and we can have a drink, okay?.

193
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:50,166
I think we all need it.

194
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,235
Thanks.

195
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:56,611
Just let him drive.

196
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:12,789
Make it a double.

197
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:36,420
Sarah.

198
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:39,082
Welcome to the winner of Tidy Camp.

199
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:44,358
Wave to the locals.
Making friends.

200
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:53,400
This Pieman guy's popular.

201
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:55,099
He owns everything.

202
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:58,610
We should get the fuck out of this car.

203
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,941
Oi. That look familiar?.

204
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,153
Toilet?.

205
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:11,883
Okay.

206
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:16,748
What did that achieve?.

207
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,585
Nothing, but I feel better, eh?.

208
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:22,427
Come on, let's have a beer.

209
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:26,288
Jesus, Matt, we only just got here.

210
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:29,163
I know. I know.

211
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:42,345
Do you want anything to drink, babe?.

212
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:45,349
Yeah, just whatever.

213
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:50,385
Can we stay out of trouble?.

214
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:53,015
Can we do that?. Please?.

215
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,687
Let's sort out the rooms.

216
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,132
Hi.

217
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,634
Be with you in a minute.

218
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:22,810
Don't even think about the towel.

219
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,822
- I think it's alive.
- Great.

220
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,385
Look, are you okay with me being here?.

221
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:34,864
I know that Jack
can railroad people into things,

222
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:36,491
and I don't want you to think that I'm--

223
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,968
No, no, no. It's fine.

224
00:20:39,037 --> 00:20:40,299
- Are you sure?.
- Yeah.

225
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:43,307
Okay, good.

226
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,502
It's just--

227
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:47,807
This place was the last stop
that my sister made,

228
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:49,642
so it's a little bit weird.

229
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:50,682
Before she died?.

230
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:53,013
Before she drowned, yeah.

231
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,645
It was an accident, apparently.

232
00:20:55,721 --> 00:21:00,283
It was eight years ago, so I was young.

233
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:04,853
Yeah, and look.
It hasn't changed a bit.

234
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,194
It's that old-world charm.

235
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,631
Interesting wildlife.

236
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,362
Lovely.

237
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:12,596
Thank you.

238
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:14,935
They jump, you know.

239
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,372
I've nothing.

240
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,343
You're kidding.

241
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:22,346
I didn't know it was pig season.

242
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:24,507
Try the next town.

243
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:28,046
If you don't mind roughing it.

244
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:30,583
Anything's fine.

245
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:34,649
Harvey. Fifth generation lrish.

246
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:35,920
Hi, I'm Matt. Matt.

247
00:21:35,994 --> 00:21:38,360
Hey, thank you.

248
00:21:40,265 --> 00:21:42,165
You see that?.

249
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:45,362
It belonged to my great-great-grandda.

250
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:47,405
Wow. Cool.

251
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:50,839
Gareth!

252
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:53,036
You got a flat.

253
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:55,579
You must have picked up something.

254
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:05,056
As he says,
if you don't mind roughing it.

255
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,729
Liam.

256
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:29,206
- Awesome.
- Here you go, guys.

257
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:32,114
Let's see if Pieman lives up to his name.

258
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:34,379
Yes, except I'm on a no-carbs thing.

259
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:36,114
That you may have to forget.

260
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,656
It's traditional Wangan's food, apparently.

261
00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:41,659
It's good. Cheers.

262
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:44,286
The mines around here
may have shut down,

263
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:45,887
but the pies have hung on.

264
00:22:45,964 --> 00:22:47,431
It's important to us. Traditions.

265
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:49,057
Tradition.

266
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:51,295
So, are the rumors true?.

267
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,428
- Rumors?.
- Yeah.

268
00:22:52,504 --> 00:22:53,903
That the tiger's alive and kicking.

269
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:55,906
That's what brought you here.

270
00:22:55,974 --> 00:22:58,033
That and the cooking.

271
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:59,771
It's good.

272
00:22:59,845 --> 00:23:01,472
So are they?.

273
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:04,344
There hasn't been a tiger
around here for a hundred years.

274
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:06,350
Seems to bring in the odd tourist, though.

275
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:12,084
Fine devils, but they got the teeth
that'll rip through bone.

276
00:23:12,157 --> 00:23:14,921
- Devils?.
- Aye.

277
00:23:14,993 --> 00:23:17,655
There's little hairy creatures

278
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:20,254
that'll creep up on you in the bush and--

279
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,259
That was funny.

280
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:35,502
Come on, now,
let's have us shenanigans.

281
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,104
No.

282
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:38,706
Come on.

283
00:23:38,784 --> 00:23:42,049
Come on now!
Let's have a party!

284
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,645
She doesn't dance.

285
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:52,920
Come on.

286
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:56,934
You're out of the city now.

287
00:23:58,837 --> 00:24:00,065
Let's make this quick.

288
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:01,264
Yeah. Welcome to Sarah,

289
00:24:01,339 --> 00:24:04,001
the shallow end
of the fucking gene pool.

290
00:24:04,075 --> 00:24:06,270
There's something
seriously wrong with this place.

291
00:24:06,344 --> 00:24:09,609
- I mean, that old guy with the teeth?.
- You nearly wet yourself.

292
00:24:09,681 --> 00:24:10,943
Well, do you blame me?.

293
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:14,042
I mean, a bunch of inbreds
in a fucking time warp.

294
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,417
What are they doing here, anyway?.

295
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:18,388
The mines dried up years ago.

296
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:19,583
And where are all the women?.

297
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:21,148
They heard you were coming.

298
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:22,591
Funny.

299
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:23,992
Wasn't this meant to be hooked on?.

300
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:25,324
Shit.

301
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:26,864
Anything missing?.

302
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:29,457
- Anything?.
- It doesn't look like it.

303
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:33,500
You see?.
Descended from convicts, mate.

304
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:36,735
Once a thief, always a fucking thief.

305
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:39,967
Look at that.

306
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:42,240
Fuck, look at that!

307
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:45,914
- What?.
- Look, my fucking car!

308
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:47,508
Look at that!

309
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,814
- It's not funny!
- I'm laughing at--

310
00:24:53,892 --> 00:24:55,883
Look at my car!

311
00:24:55,961 --> 00:24:59,260
Fifth generation wankers!

312
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:01,094
Look at that.

313
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:02,599
Don't touch it.

314
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:05,602
Fuck! God!

315
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,763
Can you close the top up?. Fuck!

316
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:10,569
Yeah, I will. Wait for me.

317
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,568
Come on!

318
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:45,339
You know, I haven't thanked you
for helping me do this.

319
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:47,503
It really means a lot to me, Matt.

320
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:49,046
Thanks.

321
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:02,489
Hey, I want to show you something.

322
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:04,495
Look at this.

323
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:06,121
My gran used to do this.

324
00:26:06,197 --> 00:26:09,655
Yes, please, let's talk about your gran.

325
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:13,504
- Hikers disappear, right?.
- Mm-hmm.

326
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:17,668
And here, more hikers disappear.

327
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:22,470
"The Pieman's Curse."

328
00:26:22,547 --> 00:26:25,380
1954. See?.

329
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:28,385
This one is from the '60s.

330
00:26:32,223 --> 00:26:35,317
- I don't have to read all this, do l?.
- God.

331
00:26:35,393 --> 00:26:36,621
Look at this.

332
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:39,619
Here.

333
00:26:39,698 --> 00:26:42,326
"A timely reminder of 1824,

334
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,027
"when Alexander Pearce
escaped into the bush

335
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:46,593
and survived off human flesh."

336
00:26:46,671 --> 00:26:47,660
He was a cannibal.

337
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:49,832
Who was?.

338
00:26:49,908 --> 00:26:51,876
The Pieman, Alexander Pearce.

339
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:55,538
He ate people to survive,
right here in the hills.

340
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:58,481
And that is what that little girl
was singing about.

341
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:08,050
I'm gonna have a shower.

342
00:27:10,695 --> 00:27:12,560
Hey, come here.

343
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:44,294
Oh, shit.

344
00:27:44,362 --> 00:27:46,091
Jack, the lights. The lights.

345
00:27:52,103 --> 00:27:53,900
Jack, shush, shush, shush.

346
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,805
What?.

347
00:27:56,875 --> 00:27:58,604
I don't believe it, Jack! Shit!

348
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:02,773
You all right?. I heard screams.

349
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:05,179
You dirty bastard!

350
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:07,081
But, Jack, wait!

351
00:28:07,152 --> 00:28:08,380
It's okay.

352
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:09,784
It's probably just a fuse.

353
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:11,253
What happened?.

354
00:28:11,322 --> 00:28:14,052
There was some fucking weirdo
behind the door watching us.

355
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:15,217
You sure?.

356
00:28:15,293 --> 00:28:17,761
Yeah, I know what I heard.

357
00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:19,319
Do you mind?.

358
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:23,262
You sick bastard!

359
00:28:23,334 --> 00:28:25,495
Please, it wasn't me, I swear!

360
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:28,764
You sick fuck!

361
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,104
Is that what you do,
huh, you sick fuck?.

362
00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:37,209
Come here. Come here.

363
00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:39,011
Did you get a kick
out of scratching my car?.

364
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:40,711
Did you?. Huh?. Come here.

365
00:28:42,587 --> 00:28:43,986
Yeah, you fuckin' rat.

366
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:45,818
Well, I'll tell you,

367
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:49,826
I like my car to stay brand new.

368
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:51,191
Fucking...

369
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:53,319
... new!

370
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:54,956
You get it?.

371
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:56,432
Fucking pervert.

372
00:28:56,501 --> 00:28:58,230
Here.

373
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:05,105
That was for my girlfriend,
you fucking rat boy.

374
00:29:45,049 --> 00:29:47,483
It's me, you idiot!

375
00:29:54,692 --> 00:29:57,024
Well, it would have been a good show.

376
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,288
An adventure, right?.

377
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:03,163
- Yes.
- Yeah.

378
00:30:04,335 --> 00:30:05,768
- Sleep tight.
- What?.

379
00:30:05,837 --> 00:30:07,964
It's all sorted.

380
00:30:11,609 --> 00:30:14,169
You know, I don't know
who unnerves me more--

381
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:16,611
the locals or Jack.

382
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:25,488
He took care of it.

383
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:37,426
There you go.

384
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:38,560
Thanks.

385
00:30:40,705 --> 00:30:42,195
- Watch out.
- Sorry.

386
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:43,865
Yay!

387
00:30:43,942 --> 00:30:47,207
We're off. Thanks.

388
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:49,439
All right, I'm in charge of ropes.

389
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:50,776
Hold on. Wait.

390
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,441
My camera bag--
I think I've left it.

391
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:54,382
- Oh, really?.
- No, it's in there.

392
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:56,317
No, I left it in the truck.
It's not here.

393
00:30:56,387 --> 00:30:58,514
- I'll get it.
- That's okay. I'll get it.

394
00:30:58,590 --> 00:30:59,852
You sure?.

395
00:30:59,924 --> 00:31:02,757
Yeah, it's in the brand-new car
with the brand-new scratch on it.

396
00:31:02,827 --> 00:31:05,455
Let it go, let it go.

397
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:41,422
The parents are brother and sister.

398
00:31:41,499 --> 00:31:42,898
Tried to keep 'em apart, but--

399
00:31:49,874 --> 00:31:52,308
I warned 'em this would happen.

400
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:54,106
Always does.

401
00:32:00,518 --> 00:32:02,076
Play?.

402
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:05,018
No.

403
00:32:08,393 --> 00:32:10,861
Look, I don't want to play with you, okay?.

404
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,396
I have to go.

405
00:32:12,463 --> 00:32:13,623
What?.

406
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:15,290
Katie!

407
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:27,401
Hey!

408
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:29,036
- You got everything?.
- Yeah.

409
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:32,014
- You all right?.
- I'm fine.

410
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:35,817
Let's go.

411
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:47,120
See you, Sarah.

412
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:55,431
Oi, this is good.

413
00:33:57,168 --> 00:33:58,635
Is that dam on the map?.

414
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:01,729
No. It shouldn't be there.

415
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:04,274
Well, trust me, brother,
we're not imagining that.

416
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:11,647
We've come too far.

417
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:13,843
No shit, Sherlock.

418
00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:17,017
- Is it safe?.
- Yeah, yeah, it's safe.

419
00:34:17,088 --> 00:34:20,524
Well, if it breaks, we can
surf our way back to Hobart.

420
00:34:20,591 --> 00:34:22,115
Hey, Jack, that's not helping.

421
00:34:25,329 --> 00:34:27,923
That ridge is this one right here.

422
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:29,193
Got it.

423
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:30,632
Hey, look, we've got company.

424
00:34:30,701 --> 00:34:33,169
- Hey, do you know how to read a map?.
- Jack, shh.

425
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:34,602
He can't read a map!
How'd he get there?.

426
00:34:34,672 --> 00:34:36,640
He got there on an access road.
It's not marked.

427
00:34:36,707 --> 00:34:38,675
- What do you want me to do?.
- Come on. Give us it.

428
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:41,906
- How old is this map?.
- I bought it on the way in, thank you.

429
00:34:41,979 --> 00:34:43,776
They're locals. It's their territory.

430
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:44,974
They know their way around.

431
00:34:49,687 --> 00:34:51,279
Jack.

432
00:34:52,323 --> 00:34:53,688
Let's go, kids.

433
00:34:56,394 --> 00:34:58,294
Come on!

434
00:35:37,201 --> 00:35:38,532
Thank you.

435
00:35:38,603 --> 00:35:40,662
- Here's yours, babe.
- Thanks, Matt.

436
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:42,899
Can you grab my camera bag, too?.

437
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:44,566
Camera bag. Yep.

438
00:35:46,277 --> 00:35:48,643
Hey, whoa.
What the hell is that doing here?.

439
00:35:48,713 --> 00:35:51,045
Babe.

440
00:35:51,115 --> 00:35:52,343
All right, all right.

441
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:55,317
- Jack.
- Nina.

442
00:35:55,386 --> 00:35:58,617
If you want to go waltzing around
Deliverance country, fine.

443
00:35:58,689 --> 00:36:01,055
However, I like to travel

444
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:04,151
with the William Tell Mark 5, aka Willie.

445
00:36:04,228 --> 00:36:06,628
- He's my little friend.
- Well, you know what?.

446
00:36:06,697 --> 00:36:08,665
I'm not interested
in your macho bullshit, all right?.

447
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:11,258
I came here to study wildlife,
not to kill it.

448
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:13,360
Really?. Is that why you came here?.

449
00:36:13,437 --> 00:36:16,770
Look, you know what they say, Jack,

450
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:20,368
big crossbow, really little--

451
00:36:20,444 --> 00:36:23,572
You leave my Willie alone.

452
00:36:23,648 --> 00:36:26,446
Well, you've got the map.
Lead the way.

453
00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:31,054
Come on. I'll be good.

454
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:33,955
It's just-- This is how he is.

455
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:36,118
Right. So now
you're defending him, Matt.

456
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:37,491
- That's good.
- No, I'm--

457
00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:39,291
I'm not defending him.
I was just--

458
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:42,924
I'm just saying if--
if you let him do his thing,

459
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,835
he'll let you do your thing,
and we can all...

460
00:36:47,905 --> 00:36:49,372
get along.

461
00:37:20,471 --> 00:37:24,464
So how much longer
are you gonna sulk for?.

462
00:37:24,542 --> 00:37:25,634
I just need to know.

463
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:29,441
Probably about another 30 minutes, I think.

464
00:37:29,513 --> 00:37:32,038
Okay, good. Just checking.

465
00:37:32,116 --> 00:37:35,051
Hey, Nina, love you.

466
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:39,279
Jack, you know, I pity your poor mother.

467
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:42,019
I really do.
How the hell did she cope?.

468
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,082
Pity me, Nina.

469
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,355
Yeah, I do.
I pity you, too, Bec.

470
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:48,023
I can just imagine
you two as kids, you know.

471
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,691
Now you know why I went overseas.

472
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:51,598
Hey, I heard that.

473
00:37:51,669 --> 00:37:53,227
Why are you leading?.
Where are we going?.

474
00:37:55,573 --> 00:37:56,767
Where's that map?.

475
00:37:56,841 --> 00:37:58,502
Why are you laughing?.

476
00:37:58,576 --> 00:38:01,636
You watch out.

477
00:38:01,712 --> 00:38:04,806
I don't know
what you've been told

478
00:38:04,882 --> 00:38:07,077
Becky's ass is solid gold

479
00:38:07,151 --> 00:38:08,550
Sound off

480
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:09,847
Three, four

481
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:12,216
Here, tiger.

482
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:22,563
That's it.

483
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:24,362
My blisters have blisters.

484
00:38:24,435 --> 00:38:25,595
Yeah, I'm putting my foot down.

485
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:27,262
We're sleeping here.

486
00:38:32,343 --> 00:38:35,073
Look at this place.

487
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:38,912
There are places out here
nobody's ever seen before.

488
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:40,211
Ever.

489
00:38:40,284 --> 00:38:42,548
It's amazing, don't you think?.

490
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:43,848
How far have we come today?.

491
00:38:43,921 --> 00:38:46,446
About 1 5 Ks, I think.

492
00:38:46,524 --> 00:38:47,548
You're kidding.

493
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:49,593
- Yeah.
- Who needs the gym?.

494
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:52,595
I tell you, I've discovered muscles
I didn't even know I had.

495
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:53,857
Hush! Listen.

496
00:38:53,931 --> 00:38:54,955
Listen.

497
00:39:08,145 --> 00:39:10,943
- Your serenity.
- Hey! This is good!

498
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:12,880
This is seriously good.

499
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:14,178
Hey, Matty, you got a torch?.

500
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,248
Yes, sir.

501
00:39:17,321 --> 00:39:18,982
Why?. Jack, you're not going in there.

502
00:39:19,056 --> 00:39:20,114
Come on. Why not?.

503
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,818
It's a cave.

504
00:39:21,892 --> 00:39:23,792
Better than sleeping out here.

505
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:25,920
Jack, I'm not sleeping in a cave.

506
00:39:25,996 --> 00:39:27,258
Jack.

507
00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:31,062
Jack, you're not listening to me.

508
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:33,262
I'm not going in there.

509
00:39:33,337 --> 00:39:35,305
Come on.

510
00:39:39,777 --> 00:39:40,937
Come on, babe!

511
00:39:41,011 --> 00:39:43,878
There is no way
I'm going in that cave, Jack.

512
00:39:53,924 --> 00:39:56,188
Yeah. Dry enough.

513
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:57,488
It's good for me.

514
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:10,969
I'm sleeping in the cave. Okay.

515
00:40:12,109 --> 00:40:15,169
Wait for me. Shit.

516
00:41:23,113 --> 00:41:25,274
Shit!

517
00:41:51,475 --> 00:41:53,773
Yes!

518
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:56,574
You fuckin' idiot.

519
00:41:56,647 --> 00:42:00,583
Jack, what the hell is wrong with you?.

520
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:01,879
What's wrong with you?.

521
00:42:01,952 --> 00:42:04,147
There's no law against popping rabbits.

522
00:42:04,221 --> 00:42:05,483
I mean, they're pests.

523
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:11,354
You hunt extinct dogs,
and I'll hunt rabbits.

524
00:42:11,428 --> 00:42:12,952
You know, I came here to have fun.

525
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,188
Wow.

526
00:42:16,267 --> 00:42:18,360
That's very impressive, Jack.

527
00:42:19,904 --> 00:42:22,498
You know, I thought
apes like you were extinct.

528
00:42:22,573 --> 00:42:26,805
You know, I came here

529
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:30,677
because Matt asked me
to help him help you.

530
00:42:30,748 --> 00:42:32,807
Do I hear any thanks for that?.

531
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:37,752
Nah. All I hear is your selfish,
whining tantrums.

532
00:42:37,821 --> 00:42:39,686
You know what?.

533
00:42:39,757 --> 00:42:42,157
We're really sick of it.

534
00:42:47,197 --> 00:42:50,064
Then thank you, Jack.

535
00:42:50,134 --> 00:42:52,625
Couldn't have done it without you.

536
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:58,902
Yeah!

537
00:43:01,011 --> 00:43:03,411
Rabbit season!

538
00:43:22,032 --> 00:43:23,397
That's disgusting.

539
00:43:23,467 --> 00:43:26,197
Where do you think the stew comes from?.
I mean, you are a carnivore, babe.

540
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:27,464
Not anymore.

541
00:43:28,973 --> 00:43:30,873
What is-- That's crap, isn't it?.

542
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:32,431
Mm-hmm.

543
00:43:32,509 --> 00:43:35,239
So he's gone primal
and you're collecting crap.

544
00:43:35,312 --> 00:43:38,145
It's a very different kind of holiday for me.

545
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:44,619
Oh, hey, Bec?.

546
00:43:52,196 --> 00:43:53,493
That's so disgusting!

547
00:43:53,564 --> 00:43:56,658
Put it down.
That side's still furry.

548
00:44:39,276 --> 00:44:42,143
Bind her legs!
Bind her legs!

549
00:44:46,717 --> 00:44:48,776
Come on now.
Kids love to kick.

550
00:45:34,832 --> 00:45:36,697
Katie?.

551
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:45,401
Katie?.

552
00:46:12,703 --> 00:46:14,364
Where is she?.

553
00:46:20,377 --> 00:46:21,708
Think! Think!

554
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:24,646
- It doesn't have to be--
- Then where is she?.

555
00:46:26,717 --> 00:46:29,185
It's the smell of them.

556
00:46:29,253 --> 00:46:31,881
It's everywhere since they arrived.

557
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:34,685
I don't want to lose the child.

558
00:46:34,758 --> 00:46:37,352
Find her.

559
00:47:02,853 --> 00:47:06,414
There's something out there,
in the trees.

560
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:18,100
Look. There.

561
00:47:30,647 --> 00:47:32,911
There was something here.

562
00:47:38,422 --> 00:47:40,049
Shit.

563
00:47:48,065 --> 00:47:50,295
It stopped.

564
00:48:11,922 --> 00:48:13,116
My camera.

565
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:15,215
Yeah. Go.

566
00:48:18,795 --> 00:48:20,353
Hey.

567
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:22,796
There's a tiger out there,
right outside the cave.

568
00:48:22,866 --> 00:48:23,958
Yeah, right.

569
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:28,204
Are you serious?.

570
00:48:28,272 --> 00:48:30,001
Very.

571
00:48:45,188 --> 00:48:46,621
Where is it?.

572
00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:48,681
It went back into the bush.

573
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:49,987
We need a picture.

574
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:52,585
What?. You didn't get a picture?.

575
00:48:52,663 --> 00:48:54,995
We can still get one if we go after it.

576
00:48:55,065 --> 00:48:56,930
It's worth a try.

577
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,024
You wanna go?.

578
00:48:58,101 --> 00:49:00,262
Did I miss it?.

579
00:49:00,337 --> 00:49:03,306
- I can't believe you didn't get a picture.
- Well, we didn't. All right, Jack?.

580
00:49:03,373 --> 00:49:04,397
Let's try and fix that.

581
00:49:04,474 --> 00:49:08,706
Yes. Let's just hurry up because
I'm freezin' my tits off out here.

582
00:49:10,047 --> 00:49:13,346
Nina! How big is it?.
It's small, isn't it?.

583
00:49:13,417 --> 00:49:15,977
I can handle that.

584
00:49:16,053 --> 00:49:18,351
Here, doggie, doggie.

585
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:46,707
Nina!

586
00:49:46,783 --> 00:49:48,910
- Matt!
- Sorry.

587
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:50,886
Sorry.

588
00:49:50,954 --> 00:49:52,251
Found anything?.

589
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:54,586
Not yet.

590
00:49:58,862 --> 00:50:01,296
Oh. This way.

591
00:50:18,582 --> 00:50:21,210
Stuff this.

592
00:50:39,469 --> 00:50:41,460
What are you doing here?.

593
00:50:43,774 --> 00:50:47,767
Are you lost?.
Are you okay?.

594
00:50:47,844 --> 00:50:49,038
All right.

595
00:50:49,112 --> 00:50:51,103
Okay, I think you better come with me.

596
00:50:51,181 --> 00:50:53,672
All right?. Who's that?.

597
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:56,480
Do you mind?.

598
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:58,919
Do you mind not shining that light in--

599
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:33,274
- Anything?.
- Sure you even saw it?.

600
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:34,942
I saw it.

601
00:52:35,018 --> 00:52:36,781
I saw it, Jack!

602
00:52:39,089 --> 00:52:40,522
Where's Rebecca?.

603
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:42,785
Probably having a pee.

604
00:52:44,394 --> 00:52:47,158
Bec!

605
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:49,357
Hey, beautiful lady!

606
00:52:49,432 --> 00:52:52,265
Beautiful lady! Bec!

607
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:54,064
She should be able to hear us.
She can't be far.

608
00:52:54,137 --> 00:52:55,729
Bec!

609
00:52:59,042 --> 00:53:01,135
Babe!

610
00:53:01,211 --> 00:53:03,679
She might have--

611
00:53:03,747 --> 00:53:07,012
I saw a mine shaft earlier.

612
00:53:07,083 --> 00:53:08,072
Where?.

613
00:53:08,151 --> 00:53:10,415
It was near where you killed that--

614
00:53:10,487 --> 00:53:14,389
Babe, what have you done to yourself?.

615
00:53:14,457 --> 00:53:15,651
I don't know. I--

616
00:53:16,826 --> 00:53:19,852
I don't know. Fuck.

617
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:21,397
It's not mine.

618
00:53:22,766 --> 00:53:24,097
Fuck.

619
00:53:25,435 --> 00:53:27,733
Well, what happened?.

620
00:53:27,804 --> 00:53:28,896
It could just be an animal.

621
00:53:28,972 --> 00:53:30,769
- I don't know, Matt.
- Did you see an animal?.

622
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:31,829
- Did you see--
- No! I didn't!

623
00:53:31,908 --> 00:53:33,273
- Hey, come on.
- Jack!

624
00:53:33,343 --> 00:53:34,708
- Show me where.
- What?.

625
00:53:34,778 --> 00:53:37,941
- Show me!
- I don't-- I don't know!

626
00:53:38,014 --> 00:53:41,245
I started there,
and I circled around, I guess.

627
00:53:41,318 --> 00:53:43,548
I heard some sounds.

628
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:45,747
What sounds?.

629
00:53:45,822 --> 00:53:48,290
- What sounds?.
- I don't know!

630
00:53:48,358 --> 00:53:50,292
Bec!

631
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:52,191
Jack! Fuck.

632
00:53:52,262 --> 00:53:55,390
Hey, hey. Nina!

633
00:53:55,465 --> 00:53:57,399
Just stay here. Stay here.

634
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:11,039
Bec!

635
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:15,608
Bec!

636
00:54:20,056 --> 00:54:23,287
Bec! Babe!

637
00:54:33,136 --> 00:54:36,003
Can't see a thing out there.
It's like the bloody Amazon.

638
00:54:36,072 --> 00:54:39,235
Where's Jack?.

639
00:54:39,309 --> 00:54:41,504
I have no idea.

640
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:46,244
I did this.

641
00:54:46,316 --> 00:54:49,285
I pushed for this.

642
00:54:49,352 --> 00:54:53,311
- Don't be ridiculous.
- It was my fucking trip.

643
00:54:55,158 --> 00:54:57,991
We don't know what's happened.

644
00:54:58,061 --> 00:55:00,529
I'll go and look again, okay?.

645
00:55:02,098 --> 00:55:03,895
I'll try again.

646
00:55:08,438 --> 00:55:10,565
How the hell did she get there?.

647
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:20,074
Hi, there. Remember me?.

648
00:55:24,421 --> 00:55:26,355
What happened to you?.

649
00:55:26,423 --> 00:55:28,084
Are you hurt?.

650
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:31,294
It's not her blood, either.

651
00:55:31,361 --> 00:55:33,386
Is it, Matt?.

652
00:55:33,463 --> 00:55:35,055
It's Mama.

653
00:55:40,804 --> 00:55:42,965
What happened to you?.
How'd you get the blood on your dress?.

654
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:45,803
- Can you tell me?.
- How the hell would she know?.

655
00:55:45,875 --> 00:55:47,240
She's just a kid.

656
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:50,143
She didn't walk here on her own.

657
00:55:50,213 --> 00:55:52,044
Did you?.

658
00:55:52,115 --> 00:55:56,245
Simple Simon met the pieman
playing with a knife.

659
00:55:56,319 --> 00:55:58,150
Said Simple Simon to the pieman...

660
00:55:58,221 --> 00:56:00,553
- That's a nice rhyme, little girl.
- "Will you take my life??'

661
00:56:00,623 --> 00:56:02,921
I need you to tell me what happened.

662
00:56:02,992 --> 00:56:06,120
- Okay?.
-...when the time is right.

663
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:07,322
Katie!

664
00:56:07,397 --> 00:56:08,386
Jesus.

665
00:56:08,465 --> 00:56:10,365
We came for the child.

666
00:56:10,433 --> 00:56:11,866
She's okay.

667
00:56:11,935 --> 00:56:14,233
She's okay?.

668
00:56:14,304 --> 00:56:16,101
What about us?.

669
00:56:16,172 --> 00:56:18,606
Rebecca's disappeared.
So has Jack.

670
00:56:18,675 --> 00:56:19,903
And the blood!

671
00:56:19,976 --> 00:56:21,773
Look at her, for God's sake.

672
00:56:21,845 --> 00:56:23,210
- She's covered in it.
- Now, now.

673
00:56:23,279 --> 00:56:25,372
- Get away from me!
- Anything could have happened to her.

674
00:56:25,448 --> 00:56:27,678
The bush is different at night, lad.

675
00:56:27,751 --> 00:56:29,275
There are hundreds of mine shafts.

676
00:56:29,352 --> 00:56:31,786
You must have realized the dangers
before coming here.

677
00:56:31,855 --> 00:56:33,550
It's easy to lose your way.

678
00:56:33,623 --> 00:56:34,988
I'll take them.

679
00:56:36,092 --> 00:56:38,219
She won't be hard to track.

680
00:56:43,032 --> 00:56:47,025
Get your stuff.
Get your stuff! Move!

681
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:50,129
Come on. At least they're willing to help.

682
00:56:51,374 --> 00:56:53,137
Come on.

683
00:56:57,947 --> 00:56:59,312
Keep close.

684
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:25,437
Why'd you come here?.

685
00:57:25,508 --> 00:57:29,239
You tourist turn up.
You always interfere.

686
00:57:29,312 --> 00:57:30,973
You trample on everything.

687
00:57:31,047 --> 00:57:33,447
You spoil everything.

688
00:57:35,618 --> 00:57:37,711
Tell me where's my sister.

689
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:40,984
She died here eight years ago.

690
00:57:42,725 --> 00:57:47,162
She stayed for about a year,
looking for your tiger.

691
00:57:50,166 --> 00:57:53,067
That little girl recognized her.

692
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:56,765
When a bitch is on heat,
she'll go out of her way to mate.

693
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:59,001
That's how it is.

694
00:57:59,075 --> 00:58:01,100
Jesus. What kind of stone age--

695
00:58:01,177 --> 00:58:03,771
What are you saying?.
What the fuck are you saying?.

696
00:58:03,847 --> 00:58:06,782
That that little girl is m--

697
00:58:09,252 --> 00:58:12,744
Jesus Christ.

698
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:15,916
Who are these people?.

699
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:17,050
I can't go with him.

700
00:58:17,126 --> 00:58:18,923
What else can we do?.

701
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:23,159
He's the only one helping us right now.

702
00:58:23,233 --> 00:58:25,258
Come on.

703
00:58:36,312 --> 00:58:38,439
Come on.

704
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:40,915
Come on, baby.

705
00:58:40,984 --> 00:58:42,815
Fuck.

706
00:59:01,971 --> 00:59:03,802
Hey! Hey, hey.

707
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:04,965
Where are you taking us?.

708
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:07,532
You want to find your friend?.

709
00:59:15,184 --> 00:59:17,175
It's an old miner's tunnel.

710
00:59:17,253 --> 00:59:19,687
I used to play here when I was a kid.

711
00:59:25,728 --> 00:59:28,856
Like you said, what else
are we going to do?.

712
00:59:28,932 --> 00:59:30,559
Wait!

713
00:59:49,485 --> 00:59:51,009
Man trap.

714
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:54,488
Troopers used to sit 'em
outside the convict camps.

715
00:59:54,557 --> 00:59:57,253
This is as far as I go.

716
00:59:57,327 --> 00:59:58,954
What?.

717
00:59:59,028 --> 01:00:00,120
Where are you going?.

718
01:00:00,196 --> 01:00:02,528
It'll bring you out on the other side.

719
01:00:05,034 --> 01:00:06,899
Do you trust him?.

720
01:00:10,873 --> 01:00:12,898
Stay by me.

721
01:00:15,845 --> 01:00:17,938
Go home.

722
01:00:35,965 --> 01:00:37,796
Stay close to me.

723
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:46,135
- Watch your step.
- Yeah. Yeah.

724
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:49,637
- It's okay. Just--
- Slow down, Matt.

725
01:00:49,712 --> 01:00:51,304
Stay in the light.

726
01:00:59,589 --> 01:01:01,682
- Can't see.
- Okay.

727
01:01:01,758 --> 01:01:04,352
- Just step over it.
- I see it.

728
01:01:06,462 --> 01:01:07,952
There's the exit.

729
01:01:08,031 --> 01:01:10,625
Is that Jack?.

730
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:11,928
Jack!

731
01:01:12,001 --> 01:01:13,434
Jack!

732
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:15,994
Matt! Careful!

733
01:01:19,208 --> 01:01:20,971
Jack!

734
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:33,580
There he is.

735
01:01:54,310 --> 01:01:55,299
Rowan?.

736
01:01:59,148 --> 01:02:03,278
Listen, we don't have to do this.

737
01:02:03,352 --> 01:02:05,479
We don't...

738
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:08,615
have to live by the rules.

739
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:12,622
You hear me?.

740
01:02:15,698 --> 01:02:17,427
Rowan?.

741
01:02:30,747 --> 01:02:33,375
I can't hear anything.

742
01:02:35,284 --> 01:02:36,876
Let's go back.

743
01:03:18,361 --> 01:03:20,625
What do we do now?.

744
01:03:20,696 --> 01:03:22,664
Shall we go back?.

745
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:26,963
Where the fuck are they, Matt?.

746
01:03:58,067 --> 01:04:00,433
Shit. Shit.

747
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:02,403
What's that?. What is it?.

748
01:04:03,973 --> 01:04:05,099
Jack?.

749
01:04:11,414 --> 01:04:12,403
Let's go.

750
01:04:12,481 --> 01:04:14,278
It could be Jack.

751
01:04:23,025 --> 01:04:24,822
Jesus Christ, Jack.

752
01:04:26,329 --> 01:04:28,763
What the fuck have you done?.

753
01:04:30,499 --> 01:04:31,625
Wha--

754
01:04:36,572 --> 01:04:38,540
Shit.

755
01:04:40,843 --> 01:04:42,811
Matt, can you do something?.
Can you pull it out?.

756
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:44,244
What?. Pull it--

757
01:04:44,313 --> 01:04:45,473
I don't know.

758
01:04:45,548 --> 01:04:47,175
Here. Hold him. Hold him.

759
01:04:49,452 --> 01:04:52,046
I'll make this as fast as I can, mate.

760
01:04:54,223 --> 01:04:56,157
I can't do it. I can't do it.

761
01:04:56,225 --> 01:04:58,785
- Jack?.
- Pull it through.

762
01:04:58,861 --> 01:05:00,192
Huh?.

763
01:05:00,263 --> 01:05:02,458
Pull the prick off it.

764
01:05:07,103 --> 01:05:08,127
Do it!

765
01:05:17,346 --> 01:05:19,678
How is he?.
Has he lost a lot of blood?.

766
01:05:19,749 --> 01:05:22,479
I don't know.
I'm not a doctor.

767
01:05:22,551 --> 01:05:25,247
Who gives a fuck about him?.

768
01:05:25,321 --> 01:05:27,448
What about the blood
on Rebecca's jacket?.

769
01:05:27,523 --> 01:05:29,218
Jack, wait up.

770
01:05:29,292 --> 01:05:32,318
Just come back and think rationally
for three seconds.

771
01:05:32,395 --> 01:05:35,626
For Christ's sakes, Jack.
Can you please stay with us?.

772
01:05:35,698 --> 01:05:38,132
Matt needs you here.

773
01:05:39,669 --> 01:05:41,864
I need you here.

774
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:45,630
You don't get it, do you?.

775
01:05:45,708 --> 01:05:48,575
Doesn't matter what we do.

776
01:05:48,644 --> 01:05:53,411
It's their turf, and they're watching.

777
01:05:55,651 --> 01:05:56,640
Where is she?.

778
01:05:56,719 --> 01:05:59,051
We will find Rebecca.

779
01:05:59,121 --> 01:06:00,110
Okay?.

780
01:06:00,189 --> 01:06:01,747
And then we're all gonna get out of here.

781
01:06:01,824 --> 01:06:03,655
And he's gonna help.

782
01:06:03,726 --> 01:06:06,559
I can walk.

783
01:06:09,465 --> 01:06:12,662
Jack, come on.

784
01:06:12,735 --> 01:06:14,327
Come on, mate.

785
01:06:14,403 --> 01:06:16,200
Let's get outta here.

786
01:06:45,701 --> 01:06:48,693
Hey! Who lives there?.

787
01:06:48,771 --> 01:06:51,262
The child's father.

788
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:53,205
What do you mean?.
The girl from the cave?.

789
01:06:54,610 --> 01:06:57,545
- Matt?.
- Care to take a look?.

790
01:06:57,613 --> 01:07:01,014
No, I don't want to go in there.

791
01:07:01,083 --> 01:07:03,483
Stay here. Okay?.

792
01:07:03,552 --> 01:07:04,814
We'll be back in a second.

793
01:07:04,887 --> 01:07:06,184
I promise.

794
01:07:15,798 --> 01:07:17,459
Hello?.

795
01:07:24,006 --> 01:07:25,974
Hello?.

796
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:37,981
Hello?.

797
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:53,165
Fuck.

798
01:07:56,372 --> 01:07:59,637
What the fuck, man?.

799
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:19,589
Jack.

800
01:08:36,212 --> 01:08:38,271
Jesus, what's that smell?.

801
01:09:48,517 --> 01:09:50,212
Wait.

802
01:10:46,909 --> 01:10:49,605
No, you bastard! No!

803
01:10:49,678 --> 01:10:52,238
You fuckin' evil bastard!

804
01:10:54,783 --> 01:10:57,251
I'm gonna kill you!

805
01:10:57,319 --> 01:11:00,482
Come on!

806
01:11:00,556 --> 01:11:02,922
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

807
01:11:02,992 --> 01:11:05,722
I'm gonna kill you,
you miserable fuck!

808
01:11:05,794 --> 01:11:08,627
Fuck you! Fuck you.

809
01:11:08,697 --> 01:11:10,858
Come on!

810
01:11:17,072 --> 01:11:19,006
Jack!

811
01:11:19,074 --> 01:11:21,542
Go. Go help.

812
01:11:25,481 --> 01:11:26,846
Jack!

813
01:11:29,184 --> 01:11:31,709
Fuck it!

814
01:11:31,787 --> 01:11:32,879
Fuck it.

815
01:11:32,955 --> 01:11:34,479
Shit!

816
01:11:36,558 --> 01:11:37,957
Goddammit!

817
01:11:38,027 --> 01:11:39,551
Jack!

818
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:42,961
Jack!

819
01:11:49,238 --> 01:11:50,569
Jack.

820
01:12:04,286 --> 01:12:06,277
Fuck.

821
01:12:09,491 --> 01:12:11,083
Nina, let's go.

822
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:14,027
Come on. Come on.

823
01:12:14,096 --> 01:12:15,393
Get up.

824
01:12:15,464 --> 01:12:16,897
Nina!

825
01:12:16,965 --> 01:12:18,865
Come on. Hang on.

826
01:12:22,404 --> 01:12:23,632
Nina, please.

827
01:12:23,706 --> 01:12:25,196
Come on!

828
01:12:25,274 --> 01:12:27,834
He's in the bushes.
We heard him.

829
01:12:30,279 --> 01:12:31,974
Shit.

830
01:12:33,749 --> 01:12:36,343
Stay here.
Stay here, okay?.

831
01:12:36,418 --> 01:12:37,942
Yes?.

832
01:12:59,274 --> 01:13:01,037
Come on.

833
01:13:02,978 --> 01:13:04,536
Come on!

834
01:13:06,715 --> 01:13:08,182
Harvey?.

835
01:13:14,056 --> 01:13:15,717
Harvey?.

836
01:13:27,903 --> 01:13:29,370
Please, please, please.

837
01:13:35,411 --> 01:13:37,641
What did you hope to find?.

838
01:13:39,448 --> 01:13:41,678
Please.

839
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:43,718
We've been here a long time.

840
01:13:43,786 --> 01:13:47,449
Almost as long as the nation.

841
01:13:47,523 --> 01:13:50,686
We have a life to protect.

842
01:13:50,759 --> 01:13:53,023
A tradition.

843
01:13:54,630 --> 01:13:58,532
You tourists have no tradition.

844
01:14:03,605 --> 01:14:04,594
Fuck!

845
01:14:14,116 --> 01:14:18,553
I can feel the family resemblance.

846
01:14:20,222 --> 01:14:21,621
You fucker!

847
01:14:21,690 --> 01:14:23,214
Oh, shit!

848
01:14:26,829 --> 01:14:28,558
- Fuck!
- Nina.

849
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:52,981
Nina?.

850
01:15:23,785 --> 01:15:24,774
Nina.

851
01:15:48,176 --> 01:15:51,475
Nina, is that you?.

852
01:16:18,073 --> 01:16:19,665
Come on.

853
01:16:22,511 --> 01:16:24,604
What--

854
01:16:47,669 --> 01:16:48,727
Nina!

855
01:16:51,106 --> 01:16:53,301
Nina?.

856
01:16:57,045 --> 01:17:01,038
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

857
01:18:01,476 --> 01:18:04,343
Nina!

858
01:18:07,482 --> 01:18:09,814
Over here.

859
01:18:29,237 --> 01:18:30,397
Shit!

860
01:19:01,770 --> 01:19:04,671
You're a silly girl.

861
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:06,970
All this trouble.

862
01:19:07,042 --> 01:19:08,634
The lrish.

863
01:19:08,710 --> 01:19:10,871
Stubborn and willful.
Willful and stubborn.

864
01:19:19,721 --> 01:19:23,452
Come on now.

865
01:19:23,525 --> 01:19:27,120
You know you want this.

866
01:19:27,195 --> 01:19:29,925
Your sister, she did.

867
01:19:29,998 --> 01:19:32,990
A good breeder.

868
01:19:36,238 --> 01:19:39,173
Fertile, as you are.

869
01:19:39,241 --> 01:19:42,108
For the good of the family.

870
01:20:07,569 --> 01:20:10,402
No!

871
01:20:11,540 --> 01:20:12,529
No!

872
01:20:36,798 --> 01:20:39,494
Should have been done
when you were a pup.

873
01:21:20,375 --> 01:21:21,535
You killed her.

874
01:21:24,512 --> 01:21:26,605
You fucking killed her!

875
01:21:39,027 --> 01:21:40,892
I'm sorry.

876
01:22:18,700 --> 01:22:20,565
Harvey.

877
01:22:23,905 --> 01:22:25,304
Until then.

878
01:22:31,713 --> 01:22:33,874
You head back to your city life.

879
01:22:33,949 --> 01:22:35,849
We'll know soon enough.

880
01:22:43,858 --> 01:22:45,553
Be safe.

881
01:22:49,097 --> 01:22:50,655
I never asked.

882
01:22:50,732 --> 01:22:53,724
Did you find one of those tigers of yours?.

883
01:22:53,802 --> 01:22:57,761
Well, if he's still around
after a hundred years,

884
01:22:57,839 --> 01:23:01,798
he be one slippery shite.

885
01:23:17,092 --> 01:23:20,960
Try this. They're bloody great.

886
01:23:21,029 --> 01:23:23,862
How'd he manage to set
a man trap on his own?.

887
01:23:23,932 --> 01:23:26,332
Don't worry about it.

888
01:23:26,401 --> 01:23:29,632
I was born here.
I know these people.

889
01:23:29,704 --> 01:23:31,968
You gonna eat that or what?.

890
01:23:35,443 --> 01:23:37,843
Rebecca's.

891
01:23:37,912 --> 01:23:39,573
It should go with her other stuff.

892
01:23:39,647 --> 01:23:41,638
Righty-ho.

893
01:23:41,716 --> 01:23:44,276
Ta.

894
01:23:47,822 --> 01:23:49,949
Good, huh?.

895
01:25:29,791 --> 01:25:32,259
See?.

896
01:25:32,327 --> 01:25:35,592
We do need you...

897
01:25:35,663 --> 01:25:37,290
to survive.

898
01:25:42,003 --> 01:25:43,971
It means a lot to us.

899
01:25:49,777 --> 01:25:52,143
To keep the family going.

900
01:25:55,183 --> 01:25:57,583
The Pearce family.

901
01:26:18,806 --> 01:26:20,797
But it's hard...

902
01:26:22,377 --> 01:26:26,074
to obey rules...

903
01:26:28,483 --> 01:26:30,849
...to stay pure.

904
01:26:34,522 --> 01:26:37,787
Like your tiger.

905
01:26:41,229 --> 01:26:44,164
There's so few of us left.

906
01:26:49,704 --> 01:26:53,572
Things have to stay hidden...

907
01:26:56,678 --> 01:26:58,976
to survive.

908
01:27:08,423 --> 01:27:11,392
You understand that.

909
01:27:47,929 --> 01:27:50,727
Simple Simon met the pieman

910
01:27:50,798 --> 01:27:52,356
playing with a knife.

911
01:27:53,601 --> 01:27:56,263
Said Simple Simon to the pieman,

912
01:27:56,337 --> 01:27:58,601
"Will you take my life??'

913
01:27:58,673 --> 01:28:01,403
Said the pieman to Simple Simon,

914
01:28:01,476 --> 01:28:04,570
"When the time is right."

915
01:28:04,646 --> 01:28:08,082
Said Simple Simon to the pieman,

916
01:28:08,149 --> 01:28:11,414
"Then I'll die tonight."

917
01:28:16,557 --> 01:28:18,024
I'm hungry.

918
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:36,783
Burbank, CA
