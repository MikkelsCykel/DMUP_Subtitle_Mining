00:00:01,574 --> 00:00:04,659
- It must come to an end
- Taxi for the rehabilitation centre?

2
00:00:05,574 --> 00:00:08,659
- Hang on. I have to get my smokes.
- Look at me now
- Okay.

3
00:00:08,786 --> 00:00:12,404
Will I ever learn
I don't know how

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,743
But I suddenly lose control

5
00:00:15,876 --> 00:00:19,541
There's a fire within my soul

6
00:00:19,672 --> 00:00:23,041
Just one look
and I can hear a bell ring

7
00:00:23,175 --> 00:00:26,710
One more look
and I forget everything

8
00:00:26,845 --> 00:00:31,507
Oh-oh-oh, Mamma mia
Here I go again

9
00:00:31,642 --> 00:00:34,927
My, my, how can I resist you

10
00:00:35,062 --> 00:00:38,478
Mamma mia, does it show again

11
00:00:38,607 --> 00:00:41,976
My, my, just how much
I've missed you

12
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:45,526
Yes, I've been broken-hearted

13
00:00:45,656 --> 00:00:48,941
Blue since the day we parted

14
00:00:49,076 --> 00:00:52,445
Why, why did I ever let you go

15
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:55,995
Mamma Mia, now I really know

16
00:00:56,124 --> 00:00:59,458
My, my, I could never let you go

17
00:01:06,425 --> 00:01:10,505
I've been angry and sad
about things that you do

18
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:17,470
I can't count all the times
that I've told you we're through

19
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:23,724
- And when you go
When you slam the door
- Keep going.

20
00:01:23,859 --> 00:01:29,280
I think you know
that you won't be away too long

21
00:01:29,406 --> 00:01:33,320
You know that I'm not that strong

22
00:01:33,452 --> 00:01:36,488
- Just one look and I can hear--
- Stop the car!

23
00:01:40,584 --> 00:01:42,742
Beautiful.

24
00:01:44,421 --> 00:01:48,584
I hope the photos help your sister
out of that coma.

25
00:01:48,717 --> 00:01:52,797
- Mariel! What are you doing?
- No-Nothing.

26
00:01:52,929 --> 00:01:55,005
Why didn't you tell me
you were gonna marry Tim?

27
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,517
- Who?
- Tim Simms, your fiance--
the one who wants to shoot you.

28
00:01:59,644 --> 00:02:02,978
Now, now, now, now just a minute. You
can't come in here and threaten brides.

29
00:02:03,106 --> 00:02:05,858
- I don't care how unfortunate you are.
- Fuck off.

30
00:02:05,984 --> 00:02:09,068
What is going on, Mariel?

31
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:12,196
I've seen your wedding album.
You've tried on every dress in Sydney.

32
00:02:12,323 --> 00:02:15,111
- That doesn't mean I'm getting married.
- What else does it mean?

33
00:02:15,243 --> 00:02:18,694
I wanna get married.
I've always wanted to get married.

34
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:22,080
If I can get married, it means
I've changed-- I'm a new person.

35
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:26,076
- How?
- Because who would want to marry me?

36
00:02:28,673 --> 00:02:32,718
- Tim Simms.
- There is no Tim Simms. I made him up.

37
00:02:32,844 --> 00:02:35,513
In Porpoise Spit,
no one would even look at me.

38
00:02:35,638 --> 00:02:38,972
But when I came to Sydney
and became Mariel, Brice asked me out.

39
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,472
And that proves
I'm already different than I was...

40
00:02:41,602 --> 00:02:44,140
and if someone wants to marry me,
I'm not her any more.

41
00:02:44,272 --> 00:02:46,395
- I'm me.
- Her?

42
00:02:46,524 --> 00:02:48,849
Muriel! Muriel Heslop!

43
00:02:48,985 --> 00:02:51,820
Stupid, fat and useless!
I hate her!

44
00:02:51,946 --> 00:02:55,196
I'm not going back
to being her again!

45
00:02:57,702 --> 00:03:00,074
Why can't it be me?

46
00:03:01,455 --> 00:03:03,744
Why can't I be the one?

47
00:03:12,674 --> 00:03:15,212
Have you been in a coma?

48
00:03:41,702 --> 00:03:43,861
Rhonda?

49
00:03:45,373 --> 00:03:47,614
Dad.

50
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:53,583
If they have a copy of this document,
then the option is...

51
00:03:53,714 --> 00:03:57,130
giving you a doctor's certificate
saying you are unfit to testify.

52
00:03:57,259 --> 00:04:00,462
Can I have that title deed, Paul?
That's the one.

53
00:04:00,596 --> 00:04:04,594
We can only assume that Victor Keinosuke
has given them a copy of this deed.

54
00:04:04,725 --> 00:04:08,010
Muriel, why'd you do it to me?

55
00:04:08,145 --> 00:04:10,766
I gave you money. I got you jobs.

56
00:04:10,898 --> 00:04:13,270
I put her through
this secretarial course.

57
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,974
$2,000 for two years, it cost me.

58
00:04:16,111 --> 00:04:18,270
Comes out, she can't even type.

59
00:04:18,405 --> 00:04:21,240
I get her into selling cosmetics.
We all think she's making a go of it.

60
00:04:21,366 --> 00:04:25,862
Turns out she's robbin' us blind.
You're a disgrace, an absolute disgrace!

61
00:04:25,996 --> 00:04:29,116
A-Are you Bill the Battler?

62
00:04:29,249 --> 00:04:32,950
I saw you on TV.
Can I please have your autograph?

63
00:04:33,086 --> 00:04:35,458
Me and my dad think
that you're not guilty, Bill.

64
00:04:35,589 --> 00:04:37,747
I've changed my name to Mariel.

65
00:04:37,883 --> 00:04:40,456
Good on you, son.
You spread it around.

66
00:04:40,594 --> 00:04:44,093
You can't stop progress!

67
00:04:44,222 --> 00:04:46,630
You're comin' back to Porpoise Spit
with me.

68
00:04:46,766 --> 00:04:49,436
We'll leave in three weeks,
once this inquiry crap's over.

69
00:04:49,561 --> 00:04:52,134
- I can't go back. I'm a new person.
- You're a thief.

70
00:04:52,272 --> 00:04:56,139
The only reason
I never got the coppers onto you
is your mother begged me not to.

71
00:04:56,276 --> 00:04:59,230
I want that money back.
I'll get you a job at the Leagues Club.

72
00:04:59,362 --> 00:05:00,821
I'll arrange a bank loan for you.

73
00:05:00,947 --> 00:05:03,236
You're going to make up
for what you've done, Muriel.

74
00:05:05,951 --> 00:05:11,111
It's Deidre Chambers.
Deidre! Deidre!

75
00:05:11,248 --> 00:05:14,451
Hey, Deidre!

76
00:05:14,585 --> 00:05:18,416
Bill!

77
00:05:18,547 --> 00:05:20,623
What a coincidence!
What are you doing in Sydney?

78
00:05:20,757 --> 00:05:23,046
Well, my sister lives in Sydney.
I'm down for the long weekend.

79
00:05:23,176 --> 00:05:25,750
- Pull up a chair.
- What a coincidence!
- My barrister, Graham Newman.

80
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:27,761
- His two solicitors,
and Muriel you know about.
- Hello.

81
00:05:27,889 --> 00:05:31,056
It's Mariel!

82
00:05:32,477 --> 00:05:37,222
We should get back, Bill. Victor
Keinosuke's testimony starts at 3:00.

83
00:05:37,357 --> 00:05:40,026
That Jap bastard! He's gonna testify
that I took bribes from him.

84
00:05:40,151 --> 00:05:44,101
- Commissions.
- Commissions. I took commissions.

85
00:05:44,239 --> 00:05:47,904
Cut through all that red tape for him.
I deserve some sort of acknowledgement.

86
00:05:48,034 --> 00:05:50,525
They'd never have got to build
that resort on Crown Land without me.

87
00:05:50,662 --> 00:05:53,497
- It was the Crown Land that did it.
- Total overreaction.

88
00:05:53,623 --> 00:05:57,621
- There were aboriginals living on it.
- The federal police raided the house.

89
00:05:57,752 --> 00:05:59,543
Your mother just let them walk in.

90
00:05:59,671 --> 00:06:01,912
She and Perry made statements--
told them I had money problems.

91
00:06:02,048 --> 00:06:04,420
- Don't think about it.
- Of course I had money problems.

92
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:07,124
- She stole most of it.
- You need your family around you.

93
00:06:07,261 --> 00:06:09,337
If the Feds come near you,
don't you say a word.

94
00:06:09,472 --> 00:06:13,256
- Are you and Deidre together?
- What?

95
00:06:16,562 --> 00:06:18,851
Have you left Mum for Deidre?

96
00:06:24,195 --> 00:06:27,979
Yes. We're in love.

97
00:06:33,245 --> 00:06:35,037
What about Mum?

98
00:06:37,917 --> 00:06:41,368
What happiness has your father had
in his life if he doesn't have me?

99
00:06:41,504 --> 00:06:44,504
- What about Mum?
- She'll have you.

100
00:06:44,632 --> 00:06:46,873
You got three weeks.

101
00:07:07,528 --> 00:07:11,656
It's come back-- the tumour.

102
00:07:13,826 --> 00:07:17,527
I have to have another operation.

103
00:07:17,663 --> 00:07:19,620
I'm not gonna walk.

104
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:25,492
But what about
your rehabilitation?

105
00:07:27,673 --> 00:07:30,591
They're gonna cut
my spinal cord, Mariel.

106
00:07:33,345 --> 00:07:35,421
Mum called.

107
00:07:35,556 --> 00:07:39,933
She wants to take me back
to Porpoise Spit.

108
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:43,097
I told her I was gonna
stay here with you.

109
00:08:16,972 --> 00:08:21,052
Head down! Head down!
Come on! Come on! Swing it!

110
00:08:21,184 --> 00:08:25,134
Blokes with no legs and no arms
cut through the water faster than that!

111
00:08:25,272 --> 00:08:28,226
Look at that! You're going through there
like a constipated duck!

112
00:08:28,358 --> 00:08:31,312
Look at 'em flopping around
all over the place!

113
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:33,982
Burchett, what do you think this is,
synchronized swimming?

114
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:37,648
Water aerobics for geriatrics?
You're supposed to be a sprinter!

115
00:08:37,784 --> 00:08:39,362
Go! Go! Go! Go!

116
00:08:42,247 --> 00:08:44,239
Mariel?

117
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:48,876
Ken Blundell. How are ya?

118
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:51,623
Van Arkle!

119
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:59,087
I think we found you a girl.

120
00:09:10,482 --> 00:09:13,436
David Van Arkle, Mariel Heslop.

121
00:09:22,661 --> 00:09:26,528
Mariel, you've probably seen the news
about the civil war in South Africa.

122
00:09:26,664 --> 00:09:29,915
Well, just as the South Africans
seem to be doing the right thing
by the blacks...

123
00:09:30,043 --> 00:09:34,040
the police open fire on a black soccer
club, and that is bad news for David.

124
00:09:35,173 --> 00:09:39,420
- Are you black?
- What?

125
00:09:42,388 --> 00:09:44,630
I don't know why I said that.

126
00:09:44,766 --> 00:09:47,257
Well, well, it is funny, in a way.

127
00:09:47,393 --> 00:09:50,809
But let's be honest. The South Africans
were never much chop in the pool anyway.

128
00:09:50,938 --> 00:09:53,227
David here
is a bit of a freak, really.

129
00:09:53,357 --> 00:09:55,646
And I think that he is gonna get
the gold medal...

130
00:09:55,777 --> 00:10:00,320
for the 1,500 metres
in the next Olympic Games.

131
00:10:00,448 --> 00:10:03,117
Mariel, how did you feel
when Kieren Perkins...

132
00:10:03,242 --> 00:10:05,199
took gold for Australia
at Barcelona?

133
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:11,659
- Who?
- Kieren Perkins.

134
00:10:11,792 --> 00:10:13,915
- He's an Australian champion.
- Now, David's family...

135
00:10:14,045 --> 00:10:17,828
are willing to do anything to see him
fulfil his potential as a champion...

136
00:10:17,965 --> 00:10:20,717
even if it means swimming
for another country.

137
00:10:20,843 --> 00:10:24,543
And they're willing to pay
$10,000...

138
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:28,049
to the girl that'll help Dave out.

139
00:10:28,183 --> 00:10:32,015
Are you from Sydney originally?

140
00:10:32,146 --> 00:10:34,981
What? No, Porpoise Spit.

141
00:10:35,107 --> 00:10:37,894
A-And why did you leave there?

142
00:10:38,027 --> 00:10:43,021
Well, because of all the mental things
that happened to me.

143
00:10:43,157 --> 00:10:47,569
I got shallow, and my physical being
could have been improved...

144
00:10:47,703 --> 00:10:50,276
and as well as my mentality.

145
00:10:50,414 --> 00:10:52,406
- What about the black-haired one?
- No, she was Turkish.

146
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:54,580
She's only been in the country
five minutes.

147
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:57,082
Now, whoever marries David
will have to...

148
00:10:57,212 --> 00:10:59,584
tell the immigration authorities
that they're in love with him.

149
00:10:59,715 --> 00:11:01,791
Now there'll be media attention...

150
00:11:01,925 --> 00:11:04,545
so they'll have to live with David
in his flat...

151
00:11:04,677 --> 00:11:07,761
for at least four months
after the marriage.

152
00:11:07,888 --> 00:11:10,344
I've worked out all the details
of the romance...

153
00:11:10,474 --> 00:11:12,882
which you and David
will have to stick to.

154
00:11:13,018 --> 00:11:15,474
But the most important thing
is to convince people...

155
00:11:15,604 --> 00:11:17,893
that you two are really in love.

156
00:11:18,023 --> 00:11:19,683
- What about the blonde?
- You didn't like her.

157
00:11:19,817 --> 00:11:23,067
- I'm not so sure now.
- Now, I think Mariel might be...

158
00:11:23,195 --> 00:11:26,149
just what we're looking for.

159
00:11:26,281 --> 00:11:30,196
Well, it's up to you now, love.
Would you find it difficult to lie?

160
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:33,993
I could try.

161
00:11:34,123 --> 00:11:35,996
Well, don't rush your decision...

162
00:11:36,124 --> 00:11:38,995
but if you could let us know
by tomorrow morning.

163
00:12:48,988 --> 00:12:53,484
You can dance, you can jive

164
00:12:53,618 --> 00:12:56,951
Having the time of your life

165
00:12:57,079 --> 00:13:02,156
Ooh, see that girl
Watch that scene

166
00:13:02,293 --> 00:13:06,835
Diggin' the dancing queen

167
00:13:39,912 --> 00:13:43,162
I know you couldn't have got up onto
the altar, but at least she could have
asked you to be bridesmaid.

168
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:46,825
- She did.
- Why didn't you say yes?

169
00:13:46,961 --> 00:13:48,835
You could have been on television.

170
00:13:48,963 --> 00:13:51,039
I don't want to sit up here, Mum.

171
00:13:51,173 --> 00:13:55,005
- I wanna sit in the corner.
- No one'll see you over there.

172
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:00,134
Well, if this is your attitude,
I don't know why you bothered coming.

173
00:14:07,439 --> 00:14:10,559
At least you won't
be in anyone's way.

174
00:14:23,997 --> 00:14:26,156
Rhonda?

175
00:14:28,752 --> 00:14:30,626
Is that you?

176
00:14:32,965 --> 00:14:36,298
- You're the bridesmaids?
- Isn't it fantastic?

177
00:14:36,426 --> 00:14:39,878
- We always knew MarieI'd come good.
- She's in all the papers.

178
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:43,762
- What happened to you?
- I had cancer.

179
00:14:43,892 --> 00:14:48,601
It's all right. They cut it out.
I won't walk again though.

180
00:14:50,273 --> 00:14:54,982
- You were so full of life.
- I'm not dead, Cheryl.

181
00:14:56,696 --> 00:15:00,361
Come on. We better get ready.
Mariel's coming.

182
00:15:00,492 --> 00:15:03,492
You must be so happy for her.

183
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,452
God, she has cancer!

184
00:15:08,582 --> 00:15:11,203
I'm divorcing Chook.

185
00:15:11,335 --> 00:15:14,205
I suppose I have you
to thank for that.

186
00:15:14,338 --> 00:15:17,789
I hope I can do the same
for you one day.

187
00:15:40,322 --> 00:15:43,192
You told me it would be
a quick civil ceremony.

188
00:15:43,325 --> 00:15:45,816
Ah, it's good she wanted
a church wedding. It's romantic.

189
00:15:45,952 --> 00:15:48,823
It looks like you mean it.

190
00:15:48,955 --> 00:15:52,787
All the guests are on her side.
I should have hired you some friends.

191
00:15:52,917 --> 00:15:54,791
The charges don't surprise me.

192
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:56,793
The bastards have been out to get me
from the beginnin'.

193
00:15:56,921 --> 00:15:58,795
I just wanted you to know--

194
00:16:05,138 --> 00:16:07,510
Mariel, are you marrying David
for money?

195
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,929
Is this a marriage
of convenience, Mariel?

196
00:16:10,059 --> 00:16:12,016
Mariel, how long have you and David--

197
00:16:12,145 --> 00:16:15,561
Your Mum's arriving in Sydney by bus
because I can't afford a plane ticket.

198
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:17,564
- You see what you've done to me?
- Where is she now?

199
00:16:17,692 --> 00:16:19,601
I don't know.
Trying to get a taxi, I suppose.

200
00:16:31,581 --> 00:16:34,072
Mariel.

201
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:36,082
You're beautiful.

202
00:17:19,585 --> 00:17:22,586
Love me or leave me

203
00:17:22,713 --> 00:17:27,340
Make your choice, but believe me

204
00:17:27,468 --> 00:17:30,006
I love you

205
00:17:30,137 --> 00:17:34,431
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do

206
00:17:36,936 --> 00:17:40,055
I can't conceal it

207
00:17:40,189 --> 00:17:44,483
Don't you see
Can't you feel it

208
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:47,231
Don't you too

209
00:17:47,363 --> 00:17:51,610
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do

210
00:17:53,619 --> 00:17:57,154
Oh, I've been dreaming

211
00:17:57,289 --> 00:18:03,493
Through my lonely past

212
00:18:03,629 --> 00:18:06,748
Now I just made it

213
00:18:06,882 --> 00:18:10,417
I've found you at last

214
00:18:10,552 --> 00:18:14,466
So come on now
Let's try it

215
00:18:14,598 --> 00:18:18,892
I love you, you can't deny it

216
00:18:19,019 --> 00:18:20,810
- 'Cause it's true
- Oh, God.

217
00:18:20,937 --> 00:18:26,442
- Don't panic. Think of the games.
- I do, I do, I do, I do, I do

218
00:18:28,862 --> 00:18:30,736
She's all yours, mate.

219
00:18:38,455 --> 00:18:43,200
Father, when You created mankind, You
willed that man and wife should be one.

220
00:18:43,334 --> 00:18:46,252
- Join David and Muriel--
- Mariel.

221
00:18:46,379 --> 00:18:49,380
Mariel in the loving union
of marriage...

222
00:18:49,507 --> 00:18:52,212
so that they may be living witness
to Your divine love in the world.

223
00:18:54,012 --> 00:18:56,550
David, do you take Mariel
to be your wife?

224
00:18:56,681 --> 00:18:59,302
Do you promise to be true to her
in good times and in bad...

225
00:18:59,434 --> 00:19:03,644
in sickness and in health-- to love and
honour her all the days of your life?

226
00:19:11,987 --> 00:19:14,941
Uh, yeah. Okay.
All right. Why not? I do.

227
00:19:15,073 --> 00:19:17,149
Mariel, do you take David
to be your husband?

228
00:19:17,284 --> 00:19:19,953
Do you promise to be true to him
in good times and in bad...

229
00:19:20,078 --> 00:19:23,494
in sickness and in health-- to love and
honour him all the days of your life?

230
00:19:23,623 --> 00:19:26,161
I do.

231
00:19:26,293 --> 00:19:29,210
You have declared your consent
before the Church.

232
00:19:29,337 --> 00:19:33,501
May the Lord strengthen that consent
and fill you with His blessings.

233
00:19:33,633 --> 00:19:38,378
What God has joined,
men must not divide.

234
00:19:53,778 --> 00:19:59,781
Mariel, take this ring
as a sign of my, uh--

235
00:19:59,909 --> 00:20:05,365
- Love and fidelity.
- Love and fidelity.

236
00:20:05,498 --> 00:20:09,745
- In the name of the Father--
- In the name of the Father,
Son and the Holy Spirit.

237
00:20:09,877 --> 00:20:13,328
David, I take this ring
as a sign of your love and fidelity...

238
00:20:13,464 --> 00:20:17,509
in the name of the Father and of the Son
and of the Holy Spirit.

239
00:20:17,635 --> 00:20:20,042
I now pronounce you man and wife.

240
00:20:21,931 --> 00:20:24,338
Congratulations.

241
00:20:27,645 --> 00:20:30,183
You may kiss your bride.

242
00:21:02,053 --> 00:21:04,626
Congratulations! Oh, David!

243
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:15,558
Good on you.

244
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:18,147
- Mr Heslop.
- It's Bill.

245
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,234
Mrs Heslop.

246
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:31,449
- Thanks.
- Mariel, congratulations.

247
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:37,168
- Thank you.
- You look lovely. Have every success.

248
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,169
Well done, love.

249
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:42,465
Good on you.

250
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,108
- How do you feel?
- He's fighting fit.

251
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:05,321
The next gold you'll see
on this hand will be the gold medal
for the 1,500 metres!

252
00:22:05,448 --> 00:22:07,488
- You reckon?
- Oh, yes.

253
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:10,108
Mariel and us
have been friends for years.
We went to Hibiscus Island together.

254
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:11,869
- We're like sisters.
- She's my best friend.

255
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:16,872
- I-I tell her everything.
- Mariel! Oh, you look beautiful!

256
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:19,327
Oh, isn't she beautiful?

257
00:22:20,171 --> 00:22:21,713
She is wearing the make-up,
isn't she?

258
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:28,510
Smile.

259
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:42,063
- I was tryin' to hide from you.
- I saw your wheels.

260
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:48,697
- I didn't think you'd come.
- I had to see it for myself.

261
00:22:48,783 --> 00:22:50,941
Just the bridesmaids were worth it.

262
00:22:52,787 --> 00:22:56,535
I didn't call them.
They came crawling back to me.

263
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:58,872
The way they picked on me
in Porpoise Spit...

264
00:22:59,001 --> 00:23:00,875
saying I wouldn't amount to anything--

265
00:23:01,002 --> 00:23:05,000
And here I am, famous,
and they're at my wedding.

266
00:23:05,131 --> 00:23:08,298
- I showed them.
- Showed them what?

267
00:23:08,426 --> 00:23:10,633
I'm as good as they are.

268
00:23:13,473 --> 00:23:16,593
I have to go.
Good luck with what's his name.

269
00:23:16,726 --> 00:23:18,884
Where are you going?

270
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:22,555
Where do you think?
Back to Porpoise Spit with Mum.

271
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:27,103
- We're catching the bus out tonight.
- I don't want you to.

272
00:23:27,236 --> 00:23:30,771
Well, you should have thought of that
before you gave up on me.

273
00:23:30,907 --> 00:23:33,528
I couldn't pay all the rent without you.
I couldn't even do the shopping.

274
00:23:36,037 --> 00:23:38,444
I needed help.
I needed a friend.

275
00:23:38,581 --> 00:23:41,154
I mean, I don't want you
to go back by bus.

276
00:23:41,292 --> 00:23:43,913
I bought you two plane tickets.

277
00:23:45,379 --> 00:23:48,380
Go to hell.

278
00:23:48,507 --> 00:23:51,343
I already gave 'em to your mum.

279
00:23:51,469 --> 00:23:54,838
You're right.
You are a new person, and you stink.

280
00:23:54,972 --> 00:23:57,344
Mariel Van Arkle stinks!

281
00:23:57,475 --> 00:24:00,678
And she's not half the person
Muriel Heslop was.

282
00:24:00,811 --> 00:24:04,145
Rhonda, your mum just told us
you're moving back to Porpoise Spit.

283
00:24:04,273 --> 00:24:07,642
- lt'll be just like old times.
- Don't worry about Rhonda, Mrs E.

284
00:24:07,776 --> 00:24:09,983
We'll push her around.

285
00:24:37,931 --> 00:24:41,265
- Are you rich?
- My parents own it.

286
00:24:43,687 --> 00:24:46,807
- They didn't come to the wedding.
- No.

287
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:50,226
They paid for it.

288
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:55,402
They're in Johannesburg.
Kitchen, lounge room, gym.

289
00:24:55,532 --> 00:24:58,486
You can use everything
but the weights.

290
00:24:58,618 --> 00:25:01,191
Bathroom, my room.

291
00:25:09,878 --> 00:25:12,749
Your room.

292
00:25:12,881 --> 00:25:15,882
I'm going downstairs
for a swim.

293
00:25:22,933 --> 00:25:26,218
It wasn't just the money, was it?

294
00:25:29,064 --> 00:25:32,931
What kind of person
marries someone they don't know?

295
00:25:34,152 --> 00:25:37,652
You did.

296
00:25:37,781 --> 00:25:42,075
I want to win.
All my life I've wanted to win.

297
00:25:43,662 --> 00:25:45,370
Me too.

298
00:27:28,806 --> 00:27:33,100
$84.20. $84.20.

299
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:38,139
Ninety-nine cents.

300
00:27:39,692 --> 00:27:41,649
Ninety, one hundred.

301
00:27:41,777 --> 00:27:45,063
Thanks, Mrs Heslop.
Have a nice day.

302
00:27:47,283 --> 00:27:50,698
You can see she's not right
in the head.

303
00:27:50,828 --> 00:27:54,742
- Look, I'll see what I can do, Bill.
- You're a mate. I won't forget it.

304
00:27:54,873 --> 00:27:57,032
I'll be in touch.

305
00:28:02,131 --> 00:28:04,372
I meant to pay.

306
00:28:10,806 --> 00:28:15,017
I need help--
around the house, and--

307
00:28:17,062 --> 00:28:19,138
3:00 news update.

308
00:28:33,245 --> 00:28:36,448
Not comin' back.
I want a divorce.

309
00:28:36,581 --> 00:28:38,788
I'm marrying Deidre.

310
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:44,127
You know what they say?

311
00:28:44,255 --> 00:28:46,248
They say that I wasn't elected
to the state government that time...

312
00:28:46,383 --> 00:28:47,925
because my family
wasn't up to scratch.

313
00:28:48,051 --> 00:28:52,131
That's what they say.
Look at this place!

314
00:28:52,263 --> 00:28:54,837
I never had a bloody chance!

315
00:29:38,183 --> 00:29:42,132
Get out!
Get out and find yourself a job!

316
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:46,564
Get out, you layabout,
and stop embarrassing your father!

317
00:29:46,691 --> 00:29:49,478
- You're an embarrassment!
- You're the embarrassment!

318
00:29:49,611 --> 00:29:51,983
You mad bitch!

319
00:30:58,178 --> 00:31:00,134
Oh, no.

320
00:31:08,229 --> 00:31:10,934
Mariel Van Arkle speaking.

321
00:31:14,443 --> 00:31:17,563
- Hello?
- Muriel?

322
00:31:17,696 --> 00:31:20,650
- Mariel.
- Mum's died.

323
00:31:20,783 --> 00:31:23,737
- What?
- We're all at the hospital.

324
00:31:23,869 --> 00:31:27,783
Dad says you have to come home.

325
00:31:53,982 --> 00:31:56,983
Yeah.

326
00:31:57,110 --> 00:32:00,645
The funeral's tomorrow.
Are you coming?

327
00:32:00,781 --> 00:32:03,188
Russell's gonna be there.

328
00:32:03,325 --> 00:32:08,366
Yeah. I invited him.
He says he's gonna bring Alan.

329
00:32:08,497 --> 00:32:10,454
Hi.

330
00:32:15,337 --> 00:32:18,338
- Hi.
- Mariel?

331
00:32:18,465 --> 00:32:20,872
Is that you?

332
00:32:21,009 --> 00:32:22,966
Not sure.

333
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:35,096
It was a heart attack.

334
00:32:35,231 --> 00:32:37,556
Joanie found her.

335
00:32:37,692 --> 00:32:40,895
She was lying on the bed,
looking peaceful.

336
00:32:41,029 --> 00:32:43,105
She didn't suffer.

337
00:32:43,239 --> 00:32:47,616
She made the ultimate sacrifice
for your father.

338
00:32:47,744 --> 00:32:53,449
Judge will be lenient on him now.
He's got kids to support.

339
00:32:53,583 --> 00:32:57,580
She'd be glad, in the end,
her life amounted to something.

340
00:32:59,087 --> 00:33:01,459
Deidre, I finished up
in the bathroom.

341
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:04,923
You were right
about those cupboards.

342
00:33:06,219 --> 00:33:07,963
Let's start on the laundry then.

343
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:10,504
It's a big job.

344
00:33:41,212 --> 00:33:44,213
- What happened?
- Mum burnt it.

345
00:33:48,135 --> 00:33:50,342
Why?

346
00:33:50,471 --> 00:33:53,970
Because she got sick and tired
of waiting for Perry to mow it.

347
00:34:01,273 --> 00:34:03,231
Hi.

348
00:34:14,078 --> 00:34:16,616
What am I gonna do without her?

349
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,589
Her photo album.

350
00:35:01,332 --> 00:35:07,584
She took pills-- sleeping pills.

351
00:35:07,713 --> 00:35:10,880
They were next to her
when I found her.

352
00:35:11,008 --> 00:35:15,006
And when Dr Farrell come,
they were gone.

353
00:35:15,137 --> 00:35:17,972
And when I asked
what happened to 'em...

354
00:35:18,098 --> 00:35:20,506
Dad said he didn't want anyone
to know.

355
00:35:20,642 --> 00:35:24,177
Dr Farrell said
Dad had been through enough.

356
00:35:27,858 --> 00:35:31,143
I don't know. Maybe he has.

357
00:35:37,117 --> 00:35:42,621
The Lord is good to me

358
00:35:42,748 --> 00:35:46,828
His word my hope

359
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:51,088
Secures

360
00:35:51,214 --> 00:35:55,426
He will my shield

361
00:35:55,552 --> 00:35:59,715
And portion be

362
00:35:59,848 --> 00:36:04,059
As long as life

363
00:36:04,185 --> 00:36:08,812
Endures

364
00:36:15,905 --> 00:36:19,108
I have a telefax to read.

365
00:36:19,242 --> 00:36:22,243
Keep your eye
on them journalist bastards.

366
00:36:25,707 --> 00:36:28,624
"To Bill Heslop and Family...

367
00:36:28,751 --> 00:36:34,374
Hazel and I were sorry
to hear of the passing of Betty.

368
00:36:34,507 --> 00:36:38,374
We are thinking of you
in your time of sorrow."

369
00:36:38,511 --> 00:36:42,378
Signed, the honourable Bob Hawke...

370
00:36:42,515 --> 00:36:46,133
former prime minister
of Australia.

371
00:36:46,268 --> 00:36:49,554
- What are they doin'?
- They're, they're writin' it down.

372
00:36:49,689 --> 00:36:53,104
I'll bet they are. Put that
in your papers, you mongrel bastards.

373
00:36:53,234 --> 00:36:56,899
I've still got friends.

374
00:36:57,029 --> 00:36:59,566
How many families get telegrams
from former prime ministers...

375
00:36:59,697 --> 00:37:02,188
when somebody dies?

376
00:37:02,325 --> 00:37:05,326
I'm not forgotten.

377
00:37:05,453 --> 00:37:10,411
Betty Heslop lived
for her family.

378
00:37:10,541 --> 00:37:14,705
She was very happy about
her daughter Mariel's marriage...

379
00:37:14,837 --> 00:37:17,755
and attending the wedding
in Sydney...

380
00:37:17,882 --> 00:37:22,176
was one of the highlights
of her life.

381
00:37:22,553 --> 00:37:26,421
Her life, during her last days
on earth...

382
00:37:26,557 --> 00:37:27,968
made me think of--

383
00:37:33,564 --> 00:37:35,972
Mariel.

384
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:47,572
I'm sorry.

385
00:38:07,181 --> 00:38:09,968
I thought I was so different--

386
00:38:11,477 --> 00:38:14,264
a new person.

387
00:38:14,396 --> 00:38:17,516
But I'm not.

388
00:38:17,649 --> 00:38:20,187
I'm just the same as him.

389
00:40:00,166 --> 00:40:02,704
Heslop.

390
00:40:02,835 --> 00:40:05,670
On The Beach Motel.

391
00:40:05,797 --> 00:40:08,003
One.

392
00:40:25,358 --> 00:40:27,813
I can't stay married to you, David.

393
00:40:30,613 --> 00:40:33,863
I've got to stop lying now.

394
00:40:33,991 --> 00:40:36,743
I tell so many lies.

395
00:40:36,869 --> 00:40:39,277
One day I won't know
I'm doing it.

396
00:40:44,001 --> 00:40:46,373
I don't love you.

397
00:40:51,884 --> 00:40:54,505
I-I don't love you either,
but, uh--

398
00:40:56,305 --> 00:41:00,515
I don't know. I-I think I could like
having you around.

399
00:41:04,729 --> 00:41:07,017
I'll give you the money back.

400
00:41:07,148 --> 00:41:09,473
It's yours.

401
00:41:50,899 --> 00:41:52,892
Good luck in the games.

402
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,277
You too.

403
00:42:13,547 --> 00:42:16,666
I don't understand it.

404
00:42:19,302 --> 00:42:22,089
Why'd she burn the back yard?

405
00:42:24,933 --> 00:42:26,890
We've got to stick together.

406
00:42:27,018 --> 00:42:29,805
You've got to help me
with the kids.

407
00:42:29,938 --> 00:42:32,476
What about Deidre?

408
00:42:32,607 --> 00:42:35,857
She'll lend a hand.
I don't think she's keen to marry me...

409
00:42:35,985 --> 00:42:38,061
now that livin' with the kids
has come into it.

410
00:42:39,614 --> 00:42:43,113
Someone's got to look after them.

411
00:42:43,243 --> 00:42:47,074
And it has to be you, Dad.

412
00:42:47,205 --> 00:42:50,574
You owe me, Muriel.

413
00:42:50,708 --> 00:42:53,543
Now, this isn't all of it...

414
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:56,623
but I'll pay the rest off
when I get back to Sydney and get a job.

415
00:43:04,930 --> 00:43:06,922
So you're not gonna help me out.
Is that it?

416
00:43:07,057 --> 00:43:11,054
You owe us, Dad.
We're not useless.

417
00:43:11,186 --> 00:43:15,266
We never were.
Now you're looking after the kids...

418
00:43:15,398 --> 00:43:17,972
and you're gonna tell them
they're not useless.

419
00:43:24,073 --> 00:43:27,158
How about that telegram
from Bob Hawke?

420
00:43:28,953 --> 00:43:30,910
How'd you get that?

421
00:43:31,039 --> 00:43:34,075
I phoned his office.

422
00:43:34,208 --> 00:43:36,248
I was nearly
in the state government.

423
00:43:36,377 --> 00:43:39,082
Fourteen votes I needed.

424
00:43:39,213 --> 00:43:43,626
Nobody knew who'd won for three days
till the postal vote came in.

425
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,760
For three days,
I was almost there.

426
00:43:49,265 --> 00:43:51,970
Couldn't win a chook raffle now.

427
00:43:53,769 --> 00:43:56,142
Resigned from the council.

428
00:43:57,732 --> 00:44:02,773
I'm unemployed.
Got to go on the dole.

429
00:44:02,903 --> 00:44:06,319
Imagine the faces
when I walk into that dole office.

430
00:44:07,742 --> 00:44:10,696
You reap what you sow.

431
00:44:10,828 --> 00:44:13,663
You'd think I'd have learned that
growin' up on a farm.

432
00:44:16,041 --> 00:44:18,449
You reap what you sow.

433
00:44:23,757 --> 00:44:27,007
Dad, the cricket's started.

434
00:44:28,929 --> 00:44:31,467
Hi, Joan.

435
00:44:31,598 --> 00:44:35,263
- Muriel's goin' back to Sydney.
- Are ya?

436
00:44:35,394 --> 00:44:38,264
I thought you were stayin' here
with us.

437
00:44:46,822 --> 00:44:49,527
Keep in touch.

438
00:44:49,658 --> 00:44:52,363
Bye, Dad.

439
00:44:58,207 --> 00:45:01,208
Do you want me to open you
a can of beer?

440
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:07,039
That would be lovely, Joanie.
With you in a sec.

441
00:45:09,885 --> 00:45:12,127
I'm giving it another chance
with Chook--

442
00:45:12,263 --> 00:45:14,635
as soon as he gets out
of the correction centre.

443
00:45:14,765 --> 00:45:18,015
They've accused him of raping
a Japanese tourist, which is ridiculous!

444
00:45:18,143 --> 00:45:21,310
Chook hates the Japanese.

445
00:45:21,438 --> 00:45:25,139
We better fly.
We're meeting Rose Biggs for lunch.

446
00:45:25,275 --> 00:45:28,193
Rose Biggs?
Are you friends with her?

447
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:31,654
Once we got to know her,
we found out she was just like us.

448
00:45:31,782 --> 00:45:33,609
But Rose Biggs sucked
your husband's cock.

449
00:45:33,742 --> 00:45:35,782
- Rhonda!
- Oh, she did.
- I know.

450
00:45:35,911 --> 00:45:38,200
But w--

451
00:45:38,330 --> 00:45:41,284
I sucked her husband's cock,
and it made me realize...

452
00:45:41,416 --> 00:45:43,824
we all make mistakes.

453
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:46,416
Hi.

454
00:45:46,546 --> 00:45:49,880
- Mariel.
- Muriel.

455
00:45:50,008 --> 00:45:52,795
What a surprise!

456
00:45:52,928 --> 00:45:57,803
Rhonda, Mariel--
Muriel's come to visit you.

457
00:45:57,933 --> 00:46:03,009
Actually, I've come to ask Rhonda
if she wants to come back to Sydney.

458
00:46:03,146 --> 00:46:08,353
I've got a taxi outside
and two plane tickets, if you want to.

459
00:46:08,485 --> 00:46:13,443
- What about your husband?
- We broke up.

460
00:46:13,573 --> 00:46:16,111
I knew it wouldn't last.

461
00:46:16,242 --> 00:46:19,825
What makes you think
I'd go anywhere with you?

462
00:46:19,954 --> 00:46:22,528
Because I'm your friend.

463
00:46:24,751 --> 00:46:27,538
Muriel, you can't come bargin' in here
without warning...

464
00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:30,790
trying to turn Rhonda
against the people who love her--

465
00:46:30,923 --> 00:46:35,087
against the people who were there
for her when she needed them.

466
00:46:38,264 --> 00:46:40,969
Yes, she can.

467
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:44,386
Sorry, Mum. You know I love you,
but you drive me crazy.

468
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:47,355
And you three--
what a bunch of cocksuckers.

469
00:47:03,413 --> 00:47:05,986
Who do you think you are
to call me that?

470
00:47:06,124 --> 00:47:09,374
I'm married. I'm beautiful!

471
00:47:14,090 --> 00:47:16,415
You can dance

472
00:47:16,551 --> 00:47:18,793
You can jive

473
00:47:18,928 --> 00:47:22,463
Having the time of your life

474
00:47:22,598 --> 00:47:25,802
Ooh, see that girl

475
00:47:25,935 --> 00:47:27,809
- Watch that scene
- See you, Mum.

476
00:47:27,937 --> 00:47:31,555
Diggin' the dancing queen

477
00:47:38,114 --> 00:47:42,740
Friday night
and the lights are low

478
00:47:42,868 --> 00:47:46,948
Looking out for a place to go

479
00:47:47,081 --> 00:47:49,916
Mmm, where they play
the right music

480
00:47:50,042 --> 00:47:55,712
Getting in the swing
you come to look for a king

481
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:59,837
Bye, street.

482
00:47:59,969 --> 00:48:03,468
Bye, mall!

483
00:48:03,597 --> 00:48:06,384
Goodbye, beach!

484
00:48:06,517 --> 00:48:08,759
Goodbye, tourists!

485
00:48:08,894 --> 00:48:10,887
Bye, plaza!

486
00:48:11,021 --> 00:48:13,061
Goodbye, Surf Club!

487
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:14,814
See you, surfies!

488
00:48:14,942 --> 00:48:17,611
- See ya, high rises!
- And when you get the chance

489
00:48:17,736 --> 00:48:19,729
Bye, Fun World!

490
00:48:19,863 --> 00:48:23,813
Goodbye, Porpoise Spit!

491
00:48:23,951 --> 00:48:28,363
Young and sweet, only 17

492
00:48:30,951 --> 00:48:35,363
Split & Resync: Xenzai[NEF]
***RETAIL SUB***

493
00:51:44,104 --> 00:51:48,482
I was so afraid, Fernando

494
00:51:48,609 --> 00:51:53,187
We were young and full of life
and none of us prepared to die

495
00:51:53,322 --> 00:51:56,940
And I'm not ashamed to say
the roar of guns and cannons

496
00:51:57,075 --> 00:52:01,155
Almost made me cry

497
00:52:01,288 --> 00:52:04,573
There was something in the air
that night

498
00:52:04,708 --> 00:52:09,999
The stars were bright, Fernando

499
00:52:10,130 --> 00:52:13,333
They were shining there
for you and me

500
00:52:13,467 --> 00:52:17,678
For liberty, Fernando

501
00:52:17,804 --> 00:52:21,553
Though we never thought
that we could lose

502
00:52:21,683 --> 00:52:25,266
There's no regret

503
00:52:25,395 --> 00:52:28,681
If I had to do the same again

504
00:52:28,815 --> 00:52:32,895
I would, my friend, Fernando

505
00:52:34,279 --> 00:52:37,233
If I had to do the same again

506
00:52:37,365 --> 00:52:41,445
I would, my friend, Fernando
