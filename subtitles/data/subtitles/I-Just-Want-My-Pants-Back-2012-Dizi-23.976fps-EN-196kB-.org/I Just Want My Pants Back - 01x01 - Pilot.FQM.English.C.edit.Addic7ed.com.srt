2
00:00:03,904 --> 00:00:05,172
Hey.

3
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:08,141
I'm... no,
I'm not touching it.

4
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:10,477
I don't pick up the phone
while I masturbate...

5
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:13,213
Unless I'm at work.

6
00:00:13,246 --> 00:00:15,315
A drink now?

7
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:16,817
No.

8
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,151
No, I can't.

9
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:20,487
I can't be late
for work tomorrow.

10
00:00:31,998 --> 00:00:34,468
Here. To freedom!

11
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:36,536
Thanks, teen.

12
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:40,540
That tasted like
paint thinner and ass.

13
00:00:40,574 --> 00:00:41,808
Mine was like
intercourse and tears.

14
00:00:41,842 --> 00:00:43,110
Oh, well,
I wouldn't know.

15
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:44,745
I don't remember
what sex tastes like.

16
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:47,614
Like chicken.
Wait. How long has it been?

17
00:00:47,647 --> 00:00:50,016
- Six weeks.
- Wow.

18
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,452
Six whole weeks...
You're like a born-again virgin.

19
00:00:52,486 --> 00:00:54,121
Look, Jason,
it's just a bad streak.

20
00:00:54,154 --> 00:00:55,889
You've always been
a streaker.

21
00:00:55,922 --> 00:00:57,290
Remember senior year?

22
00:00:57,324 --> 00:00:59,259
In one weekend, you hooked up
with that a.E.Phi pledge,

23
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:01,561
the german girl
with the thing on her thing,

24
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:03,296
and Dr. Phil.

25
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,265
- Who?
- The lady Hitler,

26
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,633
the chick
with the little moustache.

27
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:08,268
Debbie Lee.
Right.

28
00:01:08,303 --> 00:01:09,703
No, I mean, that
was a good week for me,

29
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,271
but being a streaker
isn't what I'm worried about.

30
00:01:11,306 --> 00:01:12,873
Seriously, Tina,
this could be bad.

31
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,608
Got any weed?

32
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:16,410
I'm just saying,
it's like,

33
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:18,078
this little dry spell

34
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:21,281
could easily turn
into the drought of the decade.

35
00:01:21,316 --> 00:01:23,083
I don't know.
Something's off.

36
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:26,086
I feel, like,
a disturbance in the force.

37
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:29,022
Maybe you should stop
making star wars references.

38
00:01:29,056 --> 00:01:30,123
Here, I'm high.

39
00:01:30,157 --> 00:01:31,391
Yeah, I'm high too.

40
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:33,393
Like I could eat
a wheel of cheese high.

41
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:35,295
As long as you're not on your
"I need to check my testicles

42
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:36,329
"for lumps" high again.

43
00:01:36,363 --> 00:01:37,931
Can we get out of here, please?

44
00:01:37,964 --> 00:01:40,300
Being in here makes me feel
like I have to poop.

45
00:01:40,335 --> 00:01:41,301
Ew.

46
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:51,878
It's Brett.

47
00:01:51,912 --> 00:01:53,480
I might go let him
give me a foot massage.

48
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:54,948
By "foot massage,"
I mean sex.

49
00:01:54,981 --> 00:01:58,752
Just talk to that girl.
Go be funny.

50
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,921
Funny to girls
is like boobs to boys.

51
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,789
Smell ya later.

52
00:02:02,823 --> 00:02:05,358
Smell you.

53
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:11,131
Hi. I'm Jason,

54
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:12,766
the guy who's been
staring at you.

55
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:15,268
Yeah, I thought
I was gonna have to use my mace.

56
00:02:15,303 --> 00:02:16,603
That would've been
so embarrassing.

57
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,105
I mean,
it's all about tasers now.

58
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,173
Mace is so over.

59
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:21,375
It's like toe rings

60
00:02:21,408 --> 00:02:23,009
or the Lindsay Lohan
legging collection.

61
00:02:23,043 --> 00:02:25,278
Or glaciers
or marine life in the Gulf.

62
00:02:25,313 --> 00:02:28,014
Whoa. You just got
a little dark there.

63
00:02:28,048 --> 00:02:29,983
"I'm a loner, dottie.
A rebel."

64
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:32,853
Pee wee's big adventure?
Oh, my God.

65
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:35,622
That's, like, the best movie
starring a sex offender ever.

66
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,290
Mm.
So what do you do

67
00:02:37,325 --> 00:02:39,459
when you're not out
being a bar hero?

68
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:42,295
Uh, yeah...
I drive Nascar, actually...

69
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,965
- Oh.
- Daytona, Talladega...

70
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:47,300
Oh, my God.
Are you danica Patrick?

71
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:49,770
Yes.
No, but same cheekbones.

72
00:02:49,803 --> 00:02:51,905
Same boobs, too.

73
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:53,974
You're really funny.

74
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,542
So are you.

75
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:58,311
Shall we continue being funny
over another drink?

76
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:00,914
Indeed we shall.

77
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:04,851
Help me
take my shirt off,

78
00:03:04,885 --> 00:03:05,919
and I'll help you
with your pants.

79
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:08,422
Deal.

80
00:03:08,455 --> 00:03:09,823
Oh, my God.
This is too perfect.

81
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:10,857
What if you're scamming me

82
00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:11,992
so you can steal
my discover card

83
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,393
in the middle
of the night?

84
00:03:13,427 --> 00:03:15,896
I mean, what if you're really,
like, a sexy transsexual

85
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:17,497
and later I discover,
oops, you have a penis?

86
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:19,099
I mean, that's always been
a secret fear of mine.

87
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:21,101
I'm all girl,
and no one takes discover.

88
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:22,703
You're safe.

89
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:30,077
You know,
I do have a bed.

90
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:32,446
Let's do it
in your fridge!

91
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:36,650
Come on!

92
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:42,289
Hurry. It kind of
smells in here.

93
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:45,125
What a fantastic email
this is gonna make tomorrow.

94
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:50,968
So do you think
I'm a slut?

95
00:03:51,001 --> 00:03:54,271
Only in the best,
most positive way.

96
00:03:54,305 --> 00:03:57,575
Listen, I had, like,
a really great time last night,

97
00:03:57,608 --> 00:04:00,044
but I have
a confession to make.

98
00:04:00,077 --> 00:04:02,780
I lied. I don't
actually drive stock cars.

99
00:04:02,813 --> 00:04:05,349
- I lied, too.
- I'm not really a woman.

100
00:04:05,382 --> 00:04:06,784
Technically you are.

101
00:04:06,817 --> 00:04:07,952
I didn't see
any boy parts,

102
00:04:07,985 --> 00:04:10,154
and I double-checked.

103
00:04:10,187 --> 00:04:13,057
I'd make breakfast,
but I know for a fact

104
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:15,860
you don't have any food
in your fridge.

105
00:04:15,893 --> 00:04:16,994
We could go get some coffee.

106
00:04:17,027 --> 00:04:18,863
Whoa, it's 9:00?
I'm so late.

107
00:04:18,896 --> 00:04:21,999
Is it okay if I borrow these?
Uh, yeah.

108
00:04:22,032 --> 00:04:23,868
I hate when my doorman
sees me in the same clothes

109
00:04:23,901 --> 00:04:25,069
from the day before.

110
00:04:25,102 --> 00:04:27,037
- It happens a lot, huh?
- Ha ha.

111
00:04:42,386 --> 00:04:47,124
Hey, could I...
Could I get your number?

112
00:04:47,158 --> 00:04:48,459
Or should I
just stalk you?

113
00:04:48,492 --> 00:04:49,660
Actually,
I'm kind of lazy.

114
00:04:49,693 --> 00:04:51,729
I think maybe a number
might work better.

115
00:04:56,433 --> 00:04:57,601
Okay.

116
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,041
See you around.

117
00:05:04,074 --> 00:05:05,709
Definitely.

118
00:05:09,647 --> 00:05:11,382
Yes! Ohh!

119
00:05:15,152 --> 00:05:16,654
Hey, how are you,
boss?

120
00:05:16,687 --> 00:05:18,355
I feel like
a thousand dollars...

121
00:05:18,389 --> 00:05:21,425
Which is 900 more than I have
in my checking account.

122
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:23,394
But whatever. I feel great.
What are you doing?

123
00:05:23,427 --> 00:05:24,829
New security.

124
00:05:24,862 --> 00:05:27,198
No one will be robbed, raped,
or murdered in this store...

125
00:05:27,231 --> 00:05:28,699
Not again.

126
00:05:28,732 --> 00:05:30,901
That's a good slogan, man.
You should put that on the door.

127
00:05:30,935 --> 00:05:32,636
Yeah.

128
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:34,371
Hey, how do you even know
how to do that?

129
00:05:34,406 --> 00:05:35,906
Well, back home I worked
at a video business.

130
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,975
Had a beautiful, big-breasted
girlfriend there, man.

131
00:05:38,008 --> 00:05:40,377
It's hard for a man
to be alone, Jason.

132
00:05:40,412 --> 00:05:43,080
Well, here we say,
"no man is an island."

133
00:05:43,113 --> 00:05:46,784
Oh, in my country it's...

134
00:05:46,817 --> 00:05:48,919
"Ugly girl blames mirror."

135
00:05:48,953 --> 00:05:50,888
Yeah, that's not really
the same thing.

136
00:05:50,921 --> 00:05:52,089
Yes, it is.

137
00:05:52,122 --> 00:05:54,391
I need an egg sandwich,
and I need it now.

138
00:05:54,426 --> 00:05:56,794
Ooh, you need
antibacterial soap

139
00:05:56,827 --> 00:05:57,795
and a barbecue brush.

140
00:05:57,828 --> 00:05:59,029
You need
a pregnancy test.

141
00:05:59,063 --> 00:06:00,931
Don't toy with me.
I'm fragile.

142
00:06:00,965 --> 00:06:02,766
Okay, whore friend
of Jason.

143
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,735
He never remembers
my name.

144
00:06:04,768 --> 00:06:07,037
So you had fun last night
with Brett, huh?

145
00:06:07,071 --> 00:06:09,607
Yeah. Let's just say
I introduced him to God.

146
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,975
You?
What happened?

147
00:06:11,008 --> 00:06:13,711
It happened.
The dry spell is over!

148
00:06:13,744 --> 00:06:14,879
Great!

149
00:06:14,912 --> 00:06:16,480
I had sex
with that girl last night

150
00:06:16,514 --> 00:06:17,882
in my  refrigerator!

151
00:06:17,915 --> 00:06:19,383
Yay! Congrats.
You're back, man.

152
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:20,718
I am. I'm back!

153
00:06:20,751 --> 00:06:22,920
God, I feel stronger
and more confident,

154
00:06:22,953 --> 00:06:25,890
like one of those guys in
the hair transplant commercials.

155
00:06:25,923 --> 00:06:27,358
No, you'd really like
this girl, teen.

156
00:06:27,391 --> 00:06:29,059
I mean,
I really like this girl.

157
00:06:29,093 --> 00:06:31,228
She's cute,
and she's funny,

158
00:06:31,262 --> 00:06:33,531
and she's
surprisingly filthy.

159
00:06:33,564 --> 00:06:35,232
These are a few
of your favorite things.

160
00:06:35,266 --> 00:06:37,368
Yeah, but she's, like,
pretty perfect.

161
00:06:37,403 --> 00:06:38,936
And I played it
totally cool.

162
00:06:38,969 --> 00:06:41,071
I was like this young
James Van Der Beek.

163
00:06:41,105 --> 00:06:43,174
Er! Uh, that's
your gold standard?

164
00:06:43,207 --> 00:06:45,075
- Yeah.
- Well, way to go, Dawson.

165
00:06:45,109 --> 00:06:46,577
Wait. I have
a question for you.

166
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:48,479
I was going through
Brett's wallet this morning...

167
00:06:48,512 --> 00:06:49,980
Whoa. Wait. You were
fishing through his wallet?

168
00:06:50,014 --> 00:06:51,115
Would you ever
carry with you

169
00:06:51,148 --> 00:06:52,383
a frozen yogurt
frequent eater's card?

170
00:06:52,418 --> 00:06:54,385
I got to get to work,
psycho.

171
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,753
Well, there's
nine punches on it!

172
00:06:55,786 --> 00:06:58,422
Nine punches?
Gay.

173
00:07:03,561 --> 00:07:05,529
Wait. Let me guess...

174
00:07:05,563 --> 00:07:06,831
Dentist appointment.

175
00:07:06,864 --> 00:07:08,098
Sorry. I'm late.

176
00:07:08,132 --> 00:07:09,600
You know, I think
I have sleep apnea.

177
00:07:09,633 --> 00:07:11,602
Webmd says I'm, like,
a prime candidate.

178
00:07:11,635 --> 00:07:13,103
Oh, no problem.

179
00:07:13,137 --> 00:07:14,939
I'm just gonna start docking
your pay when you're late.

180
00:07:14,972 --> 00:07:16,140
Really?

181
00:07:16,173 --> 00:07:18,576
Yeah, really.
It's not a democracy, Jay.

182
00:07:18,609 --> 00:07:21,245
I am pharaoh.
You are Jew.

183
00:07:21,345 --> 00:07:23,080
Now, go do your job
and build me a pyramid.

184
00:07:23,113 --> 00:07:24,882
Everybody's waiting on you.

185
00:07:24,915 --> 00:07:27,251
You know, JB,
I actually am jewish.

186
00:07:27,351 --> 00:07:29,520
Oh, great.
Happy Hanukah.

187
00:07:29,553 --> 00:07:31,989
Also,
the toilet's clogged,

188
00:07:32,022 --> 00:07:34,124
so go part
the brown sea, Moses.

189
00:07:34,158 --> 00:07:35,693
Clean it
like you mean it,

190
00:07:35,726 --> 00:07:37,061
like you know
we're in a recession

191
00:07:37,094 --> 00:07:39,230
and I get emailed a lot
of qualified resumes.

192
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:41,432
By the way,
this guy's too tall.

193
00:07:41,465 --> 00:07:44,435
This one's just right.

194
00:07:45,569 --> 00:07:48,205
Okay, uh,
you'll be playing,

195
00:07:48,239 --> 00:07:51,709
um, a piece of fruit.

196
00:07:51,742 --> 00:07:54,378
Doesn't say what kind,
but they want to see you dance.

197
00:07:54,411 --> 00:07:57,114
How the
does fruit dance?

198
00:07:57,148 --> 00:07:59,483
Happy?

199
00:08:08,592 --> 00:08:11,095
Hi, janey.
It's Jason.

200
00:08:11,128 --> 00:08:12,663
Ugh.

201
00:08:12,696 --> 00:08:14,665
Hola, janey.
Como estas?

202
00:08:14,698 --> 00:08:16,100
Jesus.

203
00:08:16,133 --> 00:08:19,336
Van Der Beek, Van Der Beek,
Van Der Beek...

204
00:08:23,607 --> 00:08:25,409
May I help you?

205
00:08:25,442 --> 00:08:29,647
Hi. Uh, is...
Is Jane there?

206
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,683
This is patakan thai.

207
00:08:32,716 --> 00:08:35,820
- Um, is this 555-0114?

208
00:08:35,853 --> 00:08:37,855
This is
thai restaurant, okay?

209
00:08:40,591 --> 00:08:42,059
Crap.

210
00:08:45,896 --> 00:08:50,100
May I help you?

211
00:08:50,134 --> 00:08:51,535
Uh, yeah.

212
00:08:51,569 --> 00:08:55,139
Um, could I have an order
to be delivered?

213
00:08:59,977 --> 00:09:01,312
- Moshi-moshi.

214
00:09:01,345 --> 00:09:03,881
Fridge girl
stole my pants.

215
00:09:03,882 --> 00:09:06,466
Here, everyone,
meet my new girlfriend.

216
00:09:06,467 --> 00:09:08,803
- You've introduced us to worse.
- How are you doing, Jay?

217
00:09:08,836 --> 00:09:10,104
Do you have
post-pants depression?

218
00:09:10,137 --> 00:09:12,273
No, but...

219
00:09:12,306 --> 00:09:13,641
I really thought
she was into me.

220
00:09:13,674 --> 00:09:15,042
I mean, why would she
borrow my pants

221
00:09:15,075 --> 00:09:16,410
if she was just
gonna blow me off?

222
00:09:16,444 --> 00:09:18,412
People take
sex trophies, Jay.

223
00:09:18,446 --> 00:09:20,080
I mean, it happens
all the time.

224
00:09:20,114 --> 00:09:21,415
It's true.

225
00:09:21,449 --> 00:09:23,717
Most of my dish rags
are from previous lovers.

226
00:09:23,751 --> 00:09:26,020
- I still have my junior-high
boyfriend's retainer.

227
00:09:26,053 --> 00:09:28,055
- Ew.
- Well, on the bright side,

228
00:09:28,088 --> 00:09:30,458
at least my career is off
to an excellent start.

229
00:09:30,491 --> 00:09:32,159
Yeah, it's been
a real banner day.

230
00:09:32,193 --> 00:09:34,662
Why haven't you
called Scott yet, Jay?

231
00:09:34,695 --> 00:09:36,163
I mean, I told him
you were gonna call,

232
00:09:36,197 --> 00:09:37,498
like, three months ago.

233
00:09:37,531 --> 00:09:39,133
Wait. You want him
to take career advice

234
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:40,634
from Scott lenchner,
the guy who asked me

235
00:09:40,668 --> 00:09:43,537
to role-play school bus driver/
sexy slow girl?

236
00:09:43,571 --> 00:09:45,072
Yeah, well, lench
was just trying to be funny.

237
00:09:45,106 --> 00:09:47,441
You know, I'm gonna call him
this week, stace.

238
00:09:47,475 --> 00:09:48,609
- Good.
- Or you'll see him

239
00:09:48,642 --> 00:09:50,077
at Stacey's
big birthday bash...

240
00:09:50,111 --> 00:09:51,345
If we ever decide
what we're doing.

241
00:09:51,378 --> 00:09:53,080
Look, it's my first birthday
in New York,

242
00:09:53,114 --> 00:09:54,748
and I just want to do
something fun.

243
00:09:54,782 --> 00:09:56,417
You know, with us
both in grad school,

244
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:58,385
we barely go out
anymore.

245
00:09:58,419 --> 00:09:59,787
Yeah. You remember
back in the dorm

246
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,123
when sloppy Stacey
used to be so punk rock?

247
00:10:02,156 --> 00:10:03,891
I was not sloppy.

248
00:10:03,991 --> 00:10:06,994
I just had low tolerance because
I wasn't eating much then.

249
00:10:07,029 --> 00:10:08,596
But speaking of rock,

250
00:10:08,629 --> 00:10:11,098
I decided what I want to do
for my birthday.

251
00:10:11,132 --> 00:10:13,000
The band waves is holding
a super-secret show,

252
00:10:13,035 --> 00:10:14,602
and I think
we should all go,

253
00:10:14,635 --> 00:10:16,504
get drunk, and dance.

254
00:10:16,537 --> 00:10:19,206
Cool.
You, uh... you like waves?

255
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,608
Yeah. Why?

256
00:10:20,641 --> 00:10:22,009
They're hip.
They're new. They're loud.

257
00:10:22,044 --> 00:10:24,311
Oh, screw you guys.
I know cool bands.

258
00:10:24,345 --> 00:10:25,646
Anyway, the show
is sold out,

259
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:27,014
but I found this guy
on craigslist

260
00:10:27,047 --> 00:10:28,048
that still has tickets.

261
00:10:28,082 --> 00:10:29,350
Jay, can you do me
a huge favor

262
00:10:29,383 --> 00:10:31,118
and go meet him outside
music hall tomorrow at 10:00?

263
00:10:31,152 --> 00:10:32,453
We've got
the tennis championship.

264
00:10:32,486 --> 00:10:34,455
Yeah, we're bringing home
the gold, bitches.

265
00:10:34,488 --> 00:10:35,890
What! Boom!

266
00:10:35,923 --> 00:10:37,258
Yeah, sure.
I can do that.

267
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:38,492
Can you see if you
can get one for Brett, too?

268
00:10:38,526 --> 00:10:39,693
I thought you only
slept with that guy

269
00:10:39,727 --> 00:10:41,028
'cause he's got
air conditioning.

270
00:10:41,063 --> 00:10:43,030
Yeah, but now
I like him.

271
00:10:43,063 --> 00:10:45,032
Plus, it's been
really muggy lately.

272
00:10:45,065 --> 00:10:47,768
- Well, I'll be going solo
and pants-less.

273
00:10:47,802 --> 00:10:49,403
Maybe it'll be
a good look for me.

274
00:10:49,437 --> 00:10:51,071
Just get over
the pants girl, Jay.

275
00:10:51,105 --> 00:10:52,640
Yeah, look,
it's time to reevaluate,

276
00:10:52,673 --> 00:10:54,041
time to heal.

277
00:10:54,074 --> 00:10:55,676
Yeah, exactly. So we'll
all go out this week

278
00:10:55,709 --> 00:10:56,911
and help you
find a new girl,

279
00:10:56,944 --> 00:10:58,345
someone who thinks
that irony

280
00:10:58,379 --> 00:11:00,047
is something
that tastes like metal...

281
00:11:00,082 --> 00:11:01,749
You know, a simple girl
that you can confuse

282
00:11:01,782 --> 00:11:03,584
into banging you.

283
00:11:03,617 --> 00:11:06,253
You are a special,
special friend.

284
00:11:06,287 --> 00:11:09,290
Start your boner, Jay.
It's on.

285
00:11:12,493 --> 00:11:15,629
Hang on, hang on.
Uh, spare some change, sir?

286
00:11:15,663 --> 00:11:18,599
Dude, we have
the same phone.

287
00:11:20,035 --> 00:11:21,235
Hey, lench.

288
00:11:21,268 --> 00:11:22,736
- Jay-bone, all right!

289
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:25,306
- Hey, thanks for meeting me.
- No worries. No worries.

290
00:11:25,339 --> 00:11:27,074
But I got to be quick.

291
00:11:27,108 --> 00:11:28,409
I have to start
setting up.

292
00:11:28,442 --> 00:11:30,411
- For what?
- Seriously?

293
00:11:30,444 --> 00:11:32,079
You need to start
following my tweets.

294
00:11:32,113 --> 00:11:34,248
We're throwing a banger tonight
in honor of our first issue.

295
00:11:34,281 --> 00:11:36,417
Hold on. Boom.

296
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:38,119
E-vited.

297
00:11:38,152 --> 00:11:39,787
So what exactly do you guys
do here, by the way?

298
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,122
We're launching
a magazine

299
00:11:41,155 --> 00:11:43,657
that focuses on
environmental sustainability...

300
00:11:43,691 --> 00:11:45,226
- Wow.
- And hot chicks.

301
00:11:45,259 --> 00:11:46,894
Calling it all naturals.

302
00:11:46,927 --> 00:11:49,230
Think models
with '70s-era bush

303
00:11:49,263 --> 00:11:52,600
in hemp bikinis,
teaching you how to compost.

304
00:11:52,633 --> 00:11:55,536
You know, I didn't know
you loved the planet.

305
00:11:55,569 --> 00:11:57,104
- Sure.
- It's a  gold mine.

306
00:11:57,138 --> 00:12:00,274
But you, you need
some career advice?

307
00:12:00,307 --> 00:12:01,942
Yeah, well,
it's a little embarrassing,

308
00:12:02,042 --> 00:12:04,011
but right now I'm,
like, a receptionist.

309
00:12:04,044 --> 00:12:06,147
- Whoa.
- Yeah. It's not cancer,

310
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,315
but it's just a b.S. Job
till I figure out, like,

311
00:12:08,349 --> 00:12:09,984
what I want to do
with my life.

312
00:12:10,017 --> 00:12:11,786
Lately I've been thinking
about music journalism.

313
00:12:11,819 --> 00:12:13,821
I don't even really know
where to begin.

314
00:12:13,854 --> 00:12:15,823
I just can't spend
the rest of my life

315
00:12:15,856 --> 00:12:17,158
doing something
I don't like

316
00:12:17,191 --> 00:12:18,592
just to get little
green bits of paper.

317
00:12:18,626 --> 00:12:19,894
You know what I mean?

318
00:12:19,994 --> 00:12:21,796
- Fully. But you ran out
the clock there, Jay-bone.

319
00:12:21,829 --> 00:12:24,298
I got to bounce.
Look, let me think on it.

320
00:12:24,331 --> 00:12:26,133
Maybe I know someone
who could be your savior.

321
00:12:26,167 --> 00:12:28,202
Great. Really?

322
00:12:28,235 --> 00:12:30,004
I'm pretty popular
right now, Jay.

323
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:32,006
I'm rolling with
super-hot locavore sluts

324
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:34,208
and delicious
raw-milk cheeses.

325
00:12:34,241 --> 00:12:36,377
People want to hang
with lench.

326
00:12:37,645 --> 00:12:39,113
Oh.

327
00:12:39,146 --> 00:12:40,381
Digame.

328
00:12:40,414 --> 00:12:42,750
Yo. Your boy lench
says hi.

329
00:12:42,783 --> 00:12:45,386
Oh, spectacular jackass,
isn't he?

330
00:12:45,419 --> 00:12:47,655
Full metal douche bag.

331
00:12:47,688 --> 00:12:49,857
But he is throwing
a party tonight.

332
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:52,359
Oh. That'll probably be
chock full of sluts.

333
00:12:52,393 --> 00:12:54,028
Perfect. Game on.

334
00:12:54,063 --> 00:12:55,596
Cool. I'm just gonna have
to pop out in the middle

335
00:12:55,629 --> 00:12:56,764
and buy the tickets.

336
00:12:56,797 --> 00:12:58,666
Oh, okay.
Aah!

337
00:12:58,699 --> 00:13:00,868
Oh. Great!

338
00:13:00,901 --> 00:13:02,937
Now I look like
the world's tallest baby.

339
00:13:09,709 --> 00:13:13,346
This place is teeming
with sustainable hos.

340
00:13:13,379 --> 00:13:15,014
Got to hand it
to lench, though.

341
00:13:15,048 --> 00:13:16,349
It's kind of cool.

342
00:13:16,382 --> 00:13:17,383
There he is.

343
00:13:17,417 --> 00:13:20,753
So is, uh,
everything dreadlocked?

344
00:13:20,787 --> 00:13:22,589
Shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh.

345
00:13:22,622 --> 00:13:24,624
Let me be surprised.

346
00:13:24,657 --> 00:13:27,560
Ugh.
What up?

347
00:13:28,628 --> 00:13:30,263
Oh, shoot.

348
00:13:30,296 --> 00:13:32,098
It's already 10:00.
I should go and buy the tickets.

349
00:13:32,131 --> 00:13:33,600
Wait, wait.
Look.

350
00:13:33,633 --> 00:13:36,436
- What?
- Cute dorks.

351
00:13:38,204 --> 00:13:40,573
It's time to harvest.

352
00:13:40,607 --> 00:13:42,742
Hi.
Great party, right?

353
00:13:42,775 --> 00:13:44,544
Awesome.
I'm Spencer.

354
00:13:44,577 --> 00:13:45,912
Thumbelina.

355
00:13:47,247 --> 00:13:48,915
I like your shirt.

356
00:13:48,948 --> 00:13:51,117
I like your potentially
clouded judgment.

357
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,752
So what brings you
to this party?

358
00:13:52,785 --> 00:13:54,287
We work here in legal.

359
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,656
Jill, what do you want?

360
00:13:56,689 --> 00:13:58,224
- Lawyers.
- Yeah.

361
00:13:58,258 --> 00:14:00,226
They're probably clean
and will leave early.

362
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,528
You take jacoby.
I'll take meyers.

363
00:14:01,561 --> 00:14:03,463
- Whoa. What about Brett?
- If our relationship

364
00:14:03,496 --> 00:14:04,797
can't weather
a minor indiscretion

365
00:14:04,831 --> 00:14:07,300
with a handsome dork,
then what chance do we have?

366
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,968
You know, I hear
there's a spot here

367
00:14:09,002 --> 00:14:10,870
where you can churn
your own butter.

368
00:14:10,904 --> 00:14:13,406
Let's find it.

369
00:14:13,441 --> 00:14:15,575
Are you expecting a call?

370
00:14:15,608 --> 00:14:16,910
No, there's
just something

371
00:14:16,943 --> 00:14:19,612
I should really
be doing right now.

372
00:14:19,646 --> 00:14:21,214
God, I should probably go.

373
00:14:21,247 --> 00:14:22,715
Oh, that's too bad,
'cause there was something

374
00:14:22,749 --> 00:14:25,418
I was really hoping
to be doing tonight, too.

375
00:14:25,453 --> 00:14:27,820
But I can't do it alone.

376
00:14:29,656 --> 00:14:31,024
- Mine!
- Got it.

377
00:14:31,057 --> 00:14:32,792
- Yes!
- Mine! Ugh!

378
00:14:32,825 --> 00:14:35,828
No, don't do it!

379
00:14:35,862 --> 00:14:37,997
- Match point!
- Where is your head right now?

380
00:14:38,031 --> 00:14:39,432
Where is my head?
That was all yours.

381
00:14:39,467 --> 00:14:41,734
- That was not mine.
- Hey, game point.

382
00:14:41,768 --> 00:14:42,969
Your serve.

383
00:14:43,002 --> 00:14:44,704
Listen to me.
We are not losing

384
00:14:44,737 --> 00:14:46,439
to "before"
and "after."

385
00:14:46,474 --> 00:14:48,174
What, what!

386
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:49,509
- Copy?
- I copy.

387
00:14:49,542 --> 00:14:50,810
- Okay.
- All right.

388
00:14:50,844 --> 00:14:52,111
Locked and loaded, baby.

389
00:14:52,145 --> 00:14:54,447
White lightning.
Chocolate thunder.

390
00:14:54,482 --> 00:14:56,282
♪ I'm gonna text you

391
00:14:56,316 --> 00:14:58,284
♪ So I don't do it
when I'm high♪

392
00:14:58,318 --> 00:14:59,786
♪ I'm gonna sex you

393
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:07,126
Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

394
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,629
Okay.

395
00:15:09,662 --> 00:15:12,599
I'm not gonna have sex
with you.

396
00:15:12,632 --> 00:15:14,701
I don't let guys
just stick their penis in me

397
00:15:14,734 --> 00:15:17,070
all Willie-nillie.

398
00:15:17,103 --> 00:15:18,505
Know that.

399
00:15:18,538 --> 00:15:21,708
- I'd never stick my penis
in you all Willie-nillie.

400
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,549
Okay, I respect
your boundaries.

401
00:15:29,582 --> 00:15:31,584
Ow! Ow! If you bite me
one more time,

402
00:15:31,618 --> 00:15:33,119
I swear I'm gonna
nut-punch you!

403
00:15:33,152 --> 00:15:35,221
- Feel my sword.
- Your sword? What, is it sharp?

404
00:15:35,255 --> 00:15:37,423
Oh, my God.
Dude, you seem okay.

405
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:38,791
I don't know.
Maybe you plan on skinning me

406
00:15:38,825 --> 00:15:40,026
and turning me
into a girl suit,

407
00:15:40,059 --> 00:15:41,661
but either way,
I'm not going to your place.

408
00:15:41,694 --> 00:15:43,229
Come on,
it'll be totally cool.

409
00:15:43,263 --> 00:15:44,964
Look, it could be frozen
and covered with sprinkles.

410
00:15:44,998 --> 00:15:46,299
It's not gonna happen.

411
00:15:46,332 --> 00:15:47,433
I've kind of
got this thing going

412
00:15:47,468 --> 00:15:48,735
with this
poet/chocolatier.

413
00:15:48,768 --> 00:15:49,802
I don't want to ruin it.

414
00:15:49,836 --> 00:15:50,904
But if you want to pay
for the cab,

415
00:15:50,937 --> 00:15:52,105
you can do
a little taxi-touching.

416
00:15:52,138 --> 00:15:53,940
- Come on.
- Dude, take the deal.

417
00:15:53,973 --> 00:15:55,441
Otherwise, a hand job
is a man's job,

418
00:15:55,476 --> 00:15:57,577
and you can get out at the light
and mime a vagina.

419
00:16:02,682 --> 00:16:04,250
Could... could...

420
00:16:04,284 --> 00:16:06,853
Could you do me a favor?

421
00:16:06,886 --> 00:16:09,722
Could you stick your finger
in my ass?

422
00:16:11,724 --> 00:16:13,626
Okay.

423
00:16:16,496 --> 00:16:19,999
How's that
working for you?

424
00:16:20,033 --> 00:16:22,902
Could you try
your thumb?

425
00:16:27,106 --> 00:16:30,510
God. You just never know
how the day's gonna end, do ya?

426
00:16:37,966 --> 00:16:39,935
Whoa!
You okay, boss?

427
00:16:39,968 --> 00:16:42,905
Not emotionally.
Do you sell splints?

428
00:16:42,938 --> 00:16:46,008
What is a splints?

429
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:48,110
Meyers is
a frickin' vampire.

430
00:16:48,143 --> 00:16:49,444
- Whoa.
- Hello, Tina.

431
00:16:49,478 --> 00:16:50,846
See, I'm being nice
to you today

432
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:52,848
because of your
festering neck wound.

433
00:16:52,881 --> 00:16:54,249
Yeah, well,
"whore friend of Jason"

434
00:16:54,283 --> 00:16:55,484
is actually
way more appropriate.

435
00:16:55,517 --> 00:16:56,685
What's up
with your thumb?

436
00:16:56,718 --> 00:16:57,986
Jacoby's ass.

437
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:00,923
Her sphincter had the grip
of a merchant marine.

438
00:17:00,956 --> 00:17:02,624
This pervy lawyer
just made Jane look better,

439
00:17:02,658 --> 00:17:04,626
by the way,
so thank you, Tina.

440
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,028
Well, be prepared
to up your bummer level.

441
00:17:06,061 --> 00:17:07,329
Stacey just called me.

442
00:17:07,362 --> 00:17:09,097
Apparently the craigslist guy
sold the tickets

443
00:17:09,131 --> 00:17:10,532
to somebody else.

444
00:17:10,566 --> 00:17:13,202
Oh, no.
That is not good.

445
00:17:13,235 --> 00:17:14,870
No.
She is pissed.

446
00:17:14,903 --> 00:17:19,107
- Well, I-I got to figure
something out.

447
00:17:19,141 --> 00:17:21,109
- Shingles.
- No.

448
00:17:21,143 --> 00:17:23,145
Come on,
you know this one.

449
00:17:23,178 --> 00:17:24,513
It's hot.
Oh, I'm so...

450
00:17:24,546 --> 00:17:26,682
Ah! Ah!
Stage 4 melanoma.

451
00:17:26,715 --> 00:17:28,417
Yes! Dream team!

452
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:30,319
Okay, next.

453
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,455
That is, um...

454
00:17:33,488 --> 00:17:35,023
That's, uh...

455
00:17:35,057 --> 00:17:38,227
That's... damn it.

456
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,928
Stand by.

457
00:17:44,032 --> 00:17:45,467
Oh, yeah,
you got to see this.

458
00:17:45,501 --> 00:17:48,337
Come on.
He's pulling a cusack.

459
00:17:52,975 --> 00:17:54,343
Come on, man!

460
00:17:58,113 --> 00:18:02,284
- You ruined my birthday!
- I can fix it! I have a plan!

461
00:18:02,317 --> 00:18:03,886
Oh, yeah, Jay,
that's really you...

462
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:05,254
The man with the plan.

463
00:18:05,287 --> 00:18:07,155
No, really,
I have one.

464
00:18:07,189 --> 00:18:08,423
You're gonna
forgive him, right?

465
00:18:08,457 --> 00:18:10,759
Ah, it's Jason.
Jay...

466
00:18:10,794 --> 00:18:14,763
Whoa, whoa. Let's see
how long he stays out there.

467
00:18:17,466 --> 00:18:20,235
Oh!

468
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:23,038
I don't care
if I'm getting older.

469
00:18:23,071 --> 00:18:25,874
My man's gonna be a doctor
and give me free botox.

470
00:18:25,908 --> 00:18:27,943
I'm gonna keep you
young forever, babe.

471
00:18:27,976 --> 00:18:30,646
You're gonna be
my own little Heidi montag.

472
00:18:32,114 --> 00:18:33,715
Hey.

473
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:34,783
How's your thumb?

474
00:18:34,816 --> 00:18:36,718
Uh, surprisingly sore.

475
00:18:36,753 --> 00:18:38,086
How is your neck wound?

476
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,721
- Uh, itchy.
- Ooh.

477
00:18:39,756 --> 00:18:42,858
Wow, Jay!
This place looks great!

478
00:18:42,891 --> 00:18:44,960
Nice comeback.

479
00:18:44,993 --> 00:18:48,130
Ooh! How much money did you
spend on these dumplings?

480
00:18:48,163 --> 00:18:49,765
Uh, almost all of it.

481
00:18:49,798 --> 00:18:51,900
Oh.

482
00:18:51,934 --> 00:18:56,271
- A crock-pot?
Eric, how did you know?

483
00:18:56,305 --> 00:18:58,807
Oh, I knew.

484
00:18:58,841 --> 00:19:00,976
Oh, those two
are so in love...

485
00:19:01,009 --> 00:19:04,012
Very boring, slow-cooked,
but very tender love.

486
00:19:04,046 --> 00:19:06,815
Speaking of love,
where's Brett?

487
00:19:06,849 --> 00:19:08,650
Was it the minor
dork indiscretion?

488
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,553
No, I found
a coldplay cd.

489
00:19:11,587 --> 00:19:14,156
- Yeah, that's that.
- Yeah.

490
00:19:14,189 --> 00:19:15,757
Oh, in all my excitement,

491
00:19:15,792 --> 00:19:17,326
I, uh... I forgot
to buy Stacey a present.

492
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:19,294
Oh, and yet
she's still getting a gift

493
00:19:19,328 --> 00:19:20,762
from the both of us.

494
00:19:20,797 --> 00:19:22,231
I put your name
on the card.

495
00:19:22,264 --> 00:19:23,765
It's just another one
you owe me for.

496
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:26,502
Wait.
What was the first one?

497
00:19:26,535 --> 00:19:28,403
I figured you could use
a fresh pair.

498
00:19:28,437 --> 00:19:31,039
Have fun
getting them dirty.

499
00:19:31,073 --> 00:19:32,474
Thank you, Tina.

500
00:19:32,508 --> 00:19:34,943
- Tina...
- Ugh.

501
00:19:34,977 --> 00:19:36,278
Here.

502
00:19:36,311 --> 00:19:37,713
Hey, look.

503
00:19:37,746 --> 00:19:39,414
Look.
I know, right?

504
00:19:39,448 --> 00:19:41,416
I was like,
"where is your ear?"

505
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:43,886
You didn't hear me.

506
00:19:46,188 --> 00:19:48,090
♪ I won't fight

507
00:19:48,123 --> 00:19:52,427
♪ I will not conquer

508
00:19:52,461 --> 00:19:57,232
♪ I won't try
to impress your mother♪

509
00:19:57,266 --> 00:20:03,205
♪ I will not dine out late
with father♪

510
00:20:03,238 --> 00:20:05,774
? We won't sip wine...

511
00:20:05,807 --> 00:20:07,142
Oh, sweet Jesus.

512
00:20:07,176 --> 00:20:09,745
That girl
really got to you, huh?

513
00:20:11,046 --> 00:20:12,481
No.

514
00:20:12,514 --> 00:20:15,817
I just want my pants back.
No, that's all I want.

515
00:20:15,851 --> 00:20:17,753
I know you're gonna pick
that up after everybody leaves.

516
00:20:17,788 --> 00:20:19,488
And what,
do some c.S.I. Crap?

517
00:20:19,521 --> 00:20:21,523
Wake up, everybody!
