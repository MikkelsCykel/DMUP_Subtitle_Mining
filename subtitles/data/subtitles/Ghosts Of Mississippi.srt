00:03:49,612 --> 00:03:52,080
It is better to settle
these matters in the courts...

2
00:03:52,282 --> 00:03:53,715
... than on the streets.

3
00:03:53,917 --> 00:03:56,852
And new laws are needed
at every level.

4
00:03:57,053 --> 00:04:00,420
But law alone cannot make
men see right.

5
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:04,118
We are confronted primarily
with a moral issue.

6
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:06,318
The heart of the question is...

7
00:04:06,529 --> 00:04:09,896
... whether all Americans are
to be afforded equal rights...

8
00:04:10,099 --> 00:04:11,862
...and equal opportunities...

9
00:04:12,702 --> 00:04:15,102
... whether we treat
our fellow Americans...

10
00:04:15,305 --> 00:04:16,636
...as we want to be treated.

11
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,831
If an American,
because his skin is dark...

12
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:23,837
...cannot eat lunch
in a restaurant open to the public...

13
00:04:24,047 --> 00:04:26,015
...if he cannot send his children...

14
00:04:26,215 --> 00:04:28,410
... to the best public school
available...

15
00:04:28,751 --> 00:04:32,482
...if he cannot vote
for the officials who represent him...

16
00:04:33,089 --> 00:04:36,058
...if, in short, he cannot enjoy
the full and free life...

17
00:04:36,259 --> 00:04:38,193
... which all of us want...

18
00:04:39,128 --> 00:04:41,460
... then who among us
would be content...

19
00:04:41,731 --> 00:04:43,892
... to have the color
of his skin changed?

20
00:04:44,734 --> 00:04:46,895
Who among us would then be content...

21
00:04:47,103 --> 00:04:50,300
... with the counsels
of patience and delay?

22
00:04:50,907 --> 00:04:53,432
One hundred years
of delay have passed...

23
00:04:53,643 --> 00:04:56,237
...since President Lincoln
freed the slaves...

24
00:04:56,713 --> 00:05:01,116
... yet their heirs, their grandsons
are not fully free.

25
00:05:01,484 --> 00:05:04,317
They are not yet freed
from the bonds of injustice.

26
00:05:04,654 --> 00:05:07,987
They are not yet freed
from social and economic oppression.

27
00:05:08,191 --> 00:05:10,091
That looks like a police car.

28
00:05:10,526 --> 00:05:14,326
And this nation, for all
its hopes and all its boasts...

29
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:18,193
... will not be fully free
until all its citizens are free.

30
00:05:19,369 --> 00:05:22,463
We preach freedom
around the world and we mean it.

31
00:05:22,672 --> 00:05:25,004
And we cherish our freedom
here at home.

32
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:26,800
Are we to say to the world...

33
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:29,535
...and much more importantly,
to each other...

34
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:33,182
... that this is a land of the free,
except for the Negroes?

35
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:36,984
That we have no second-class citizens,
except Negroes?

36
00:05:37,286 --> 00:05:39,754
That we have no class
or caste system...

37
00:05:39,956 --> 00:05:44,222
...no ghettos, no master race,
except with respect to Negroes?

38
00:05:44,861 --> 00:05:48,888
Now the time has come for
this nation to fulfill its promise.

39
00:05:49,332 --> 00:05:51,300
The events in Birmingham
and elsewhere...

40
00:05:51,868 --> 00:05:55,702
...have so increased the cries
for equality that no city...

41
00:05:56,072 --> 00:05:59,803
...or state or legislative body
can prudently choose...

42
00:06:00,009 --> 00:06:01,271
... to ignore them.

43
00:06:01,477 --> 00:06:03,411
The fires of frustration
and discord...

44
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:07,071
...are burning in every city,
North and South...

45
00:06:07,383 --> 00:06:09,874
... where legal remedies
are not at hand.

46
00:06:10,086 --> 00:06:12,418
Redress is sought in the streets.

47
00:06:13,089 --> 00:06:15,922
We face a moral crisis
as a country and a people.

48
00:06:16,826 --> 00:06:19,886
It cannot be met
by repressive police action.

49
00:06:20,229 --> 00:06:23,255
It is a time to act
in the Congress...

50
00:06:23,499 --> 00:06:26,559
...in your state
and local legislative body...

51
00:06:26,769 --> 00:06:30,261
...and above all,
in all of our daily lives.

52
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,634
A great change is at hand...

53
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:34,206
...and our task...

54
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:37,675
...our obligation is to make
that revolution, that change...

55
00:06:38,247 --> 00:06:40,545
...peaceful and constructive for all.

56
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,149
Those who do nothing...

57
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:45,454
...are inviting shame
as well as violence.

58
00:06:46,055 --> 00:06:48,649
Those who act boldly
are recognizing right...

59
00:06:49,926 --> 00:06:51,393
...as well as reality.

60
00:06:52,728 --> 00:06:53,558
Medgar!

61
00:06:53,763 --> 00:06:55,492
-Get down!
-Get the baby!

62
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:01,064
Medgar!

63
00:07:10,613 --> 00:07:12,308
Oh, my God!

64
00:07:15,651 --> 00:07:17,983
Daddy! Daddy!

65
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:19,711
Daddy, I love you!

66
00:07:22,925 --> 00:07:24,688
Daddy, don't die!

67
00:07:25,995 --> 00:07:27,826
I want my daddy!

68
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,564
Turn me loose.

69
00:07:35,304 --> 00:07:36,896
Turn me loose.

70
00:07:43,946 --> 00:07:47,973
Medgar Evers believed in this country.

71
00:07:48,784 --> 00:07:52,811
It now remains to be seen
whether his country believed in him.

72
00:08:10,373 --> 00:08:13,103
The Citizens Council's raised
thousands for your defense.

73
00:08:13,309 --> 00:08:15,436
Money's pouring in
from all over the South.

74
00:08:15,645 --> 00:08:18,113
Nice likeness.
What do you think, boys?

75
00:08:18,314 --> 00:08:20,077
Mr. Beckwith, glad to see you.

76
00:08:20,283 --> 00:08:22,274
Mighty glad to be here.

77
00:08:22,952 --> 00:08:25,420
And isn't it true
your husband was the first...

78
00:08:25,621 --> 00:08:28,522
...to attempt to integrate
the University of Mississippi?

79
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:32,787
At the time of his death,
he was involved in a lawsuit...

80
00:08:32,995 --> 00:08:35,862
...to integrate the public
school system, wasn't he?

81
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,765
Your husband must've had quite
a few enemies, would you agree?

82
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:42,267
Yes, he did.

83
00:08:42,471 --> 00:08:45,702
Your eldest boy,
his name is Kenyatta, isn't it?

84
00:08:45,975 --> 00:08:48,239
Darrell Kenyatta Evers.

85
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,579
Kenyatta's a Mau Mau name, isn't it?

86
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,769
Objection.

87
00:08:51,981 --> 00:08:53,175
Sustained.

88
00:08:53,382 --> 00:08:57,546
Isn't it true that over 100 people
were arrested during a demonstration...

89
00:08:57,753 --> 00:08:59,948
...that your husband
organized boycotting...

90
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:04,051
...a department store in downtown
Jackson known as Kennington's?

91
00:09:04,327 --> 00:09:05,658
Who's that?

92
00:09:06,329 --> 00:09:07,557
Ross Barnett.

93
00:09:07,763 --> 00:09:09,230
You're kidding.

94
00:09:09,832 --> 00:09:12,858
Nope. You don't see that
every day of the week.

95
00:09:13,069 --> 00:09:17,005
A former governor shaking hands
with an assassin in front of the jury.

96
00:09:17,206 --> 00:09:20,369
There's not a court in America
that would stand for that.

97
00:09:20,576 --> 00:09:22,703
What's America got to do
with anything?

98
00:09:22,912 --> 00:09:24,573
This is Mississippi.

99
00:09:25,047 --> 00:09:27,015
Byron De La Beckwith.

100
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:30,078
-You live in Greenwood, Mississippi?
-Y es, sir.

101
00:09:30,286 --> 00:09:32,220
My mother was a Yerger.

102
00:09:32,421 --> 00:09:34,286
Her mother was Susan Yerger...

103
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:37,482
...a close personal friend
of Mrs. Jefferson Davis.

104
00:09:37,693 --> 00:09:39,388
You shoot Medgar Evers?

105
00:09:39,595 --> 00:09:40,755
No, sir!

106
00:09:41,797 --> 00:09:43,697
Your Honor, may l?

107
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,866
Mr. Beckwith, is this your rifle?

108
00:09:47,637 --> 00:09:48,535
Let's see.

109
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,271
Well, it bears a similarity...

110
00:09:54,477 --> 00:09:56,570
...but I couldn't say for certain.

111
00:09:56,812 --> 00:09:59,542
I don't record the
serial numbers of my weapons...

112
00:09:59,749 --> 00:10:04,379
...and my gun was stolen
from my home several days before...

113
00:10:04,654 --> 00:10:06,178
...this whole business.

114
00:10:36,819 --> 00:10:38,514
How do you feel, Delay?

115
00:10:38,754 --> 00:10:41,245
I got tears in my eyes.

116
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:42,787
For Dixie, huh?

117
00:11:03,312 --> 00:11:04,438
In summation...

118
00:11:04,647 --> 00:11:08,014
...not only did surveillance cameras
provide us with a visual record...

119
00:11:08,351 --> 00:11:10,080
...of the crime being committed...

120
00:11:10,286 --> 00:11:14,689
...but four eyewitnesses observed
the defendant removing his mask...

121
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:17,381
...upon exiting the convenience store.

122
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:21,489
Short of you ladies and gentlemen
attending the actual event...

123
00:11:21,697 --> 00:11:24,962
...we don't feel the state
could have a stronger case.

124
00:11:25,201 --> 00:11:26,031
Thank you.

125
00:11:27,069 --> 00:11:28,195
Counsel?

126
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,873
Hey, Bobby. How'd it go?

127
00:11:32,174 --> 00:11:34,836
Through a combination
of superior lawyering...

128
00:11:35,044 --> 00:11:39,208
...and a less than stellar performance
by our criminal, I got a conviction.

129
00:11:39,415 --> 00:11:40,507
Congratulations.

130
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:44,982
My rape victim's reluctant to testify.
Can you handle the Harrison motion?

131
00:11:45,187 --> 00:11:46,779
-You bet.
-You're a lifesaver.

132
00:11:46,989 --> 00:11:49,958
-DeLaughter, your wife just called.
-What'd she want?

133
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:54,493
To remind you you're having lunch with
her mother and your parents at 1:00.

134
00:11:54,697 --> 00:11:56,494
How could I forget?

135
00:11:56,732 --> 00:11:57,824
Bobby.

136
00:12:00,202 --> 00:12:02,636
-You seen this?
-Yes, I have.

137
00:12:02,838 --> 00:12:06,296
Evers' widow is calling for
the re-prosecution of De La Beckwith.

138
00:12:06,509 --> 00:12:08,943
Ed, this guy was killed
over 25 years ago.

139
00:12:09,445 --> 00:12:13,176
Dig up whatever you can on Medgar Evers
and be in my office at 3:00.

140
00:12:13,382 --> 00:12:14,872
Ed, this is ridiculous.

141
00:12:15,084 --> 00:12:16,142
Well, sure it is.

142
00:12:16,352 --> 00:12:17,649
But if we try to bury this...

143
00:12:17,853 --> 00:12:20,947
...she'll have every black politician
climbing all over me.

144
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,951
My office, 3:00.

145
00:12:33,969 --> 00:12:36,403
Do we have any files here
on Medgar Evers?

146
00:12:36,605 --> 00:12:37,435
Who?

147
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:41,371
The civil rights leader
that got himself shot in the 1960s?

148
00:12:41,577 --> 00:12:45,843
I just saw that file. It was next
to the one on the Lindbergh baby.

149
00:12:46,215 --> 00:12:48,649
Clara, just bring me what we have.

150
00:12:59,295 --> 00:13:00,626
Good afternoon, sir.

151
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,904
Did you make Hinds County safer today?

152
00:13:14,109 --> 00:13:18,239
You know how it is with criminals.
It's like finding a gray hair.

153
00:13:18,481 --> 00:13:21,143
You pull one and two more pop up
to take its place.

154
00:13:21,917 --> 00:13:24,613
I love those earrings.
Have you worn them before?

155
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:28,950
I've had them for quite some time.
I just never wear them during the day.

156
00:13:29,158 --> 00:13:32,355
You see that nonsense
about the Sovereignty Commission?

157
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,256
Yeah, isn't that awful?

158
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:38,029
That fool, Rea Hederman.
Since he took over that paper...

159
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:41,601
...Iiberals like Jerry Mitchell
been trying to rewrite history.

160
00:13:42,037 --> 00:13:46,497
The Sovereignty Commission was a fine
organization that did a lot of good.

161
00:13:46,775 --> 00:13:49,005
Dixie, would you pass me the butter?

162
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:52,679
Why do they dig up things
that happened 25 years ago anyway?

163
00:13:52,882 --> 00:13:55,680
Medgar Evers' widow
wants to reopen the case.

164
00:13:56,185 --> 00:13:58,016
You can't be serious.

165
00:13:58,354 --> 00:14:00,288
Ed asked me to look into it.

166
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:06,086
You just tell him, "No, thank you."

167
00:14:06,295 --> 00:14:10,664
When will these people get it through
their heads that the '60s are over?

168
00:14:10,866 --> 00:14:14,302
The 1860s and the 1960s.

169
00:14:14,537 --> 00:14:17,529
I thought they found
that Beckwith fella not guilty.

170
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:20,573
Actually, there were two hung juries.

171
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:25,211
The reason I know is because
my late husband, Judge Moore...

172
00:14:25,414 --> 00:14:27,746
...was a spectator
at both those trials.

173
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:30,449
He'd never miss a day.
And he told me...

174
00:14:30,719 --> 00:14:35,315
...that they'd never convict Beckwith,
no matter how many trials they had.

175
00:14:35,658 --> 00:14:39,025
It's just political. I don't
think anything will come of it.

176
00:14:39,228 --> 00:14:41,628
Son, for your sake,
it had better not.

177
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:43,695
You want to be a judge someday.

178
00:14:43,899 --> 00:14:47,767
You persecute a 70-year-old man,
guilty or not, over some nigger...

179
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:51,428
...you'll have everybody in Mississippi
lined up against you.

180
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,232
-Hey, Howard.
-How you doing?

181
00:14:53,442 --> 00:14:56,070
Y'all got any
of that crawdad chowder today?

182
00:14:56,278 --> 00:14:57,472
Yes, sir.

183
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,513
-How many for crawdad chowder?
-Oh, come on!

184
00:15:02,251 --> 00:15:05,948
Mrs. Evers, Mr. Dees, I'm Jerry Mitchell
from The Clarion-Ledger.

185
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:09,147
I broke the story on the jury
tampering in your husband's case.

186
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:11,891
-I talked to you on the phone.
-That's right.

187
00:15:12,094 --> 00:15:16,292
Thank you for your good work. I can't
tell you how much it's appreciated.

188
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:18,261
I'm just doing my job, ma'am.

189
00:15:18,467 --> 00:15:22,460
What do you think your chances are
of getting the D.A. to reopen the case?

190
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:24,662
I've passed this way before.

191
00:15:24,873 --> 00:15:28,866
Let's just say I've adopted
an attitude of tempered optimism.

192
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:33,975
DeLaughter, hear the news?

193
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,344
President Lincoln just got shot.

194
00:15:36,552 --> 00:15:38,816
Some guy named Booth did it.

195
00:15:40,322 --> 00:15:44,281
The Sovereignty Commission, a state
agency, worked against the D.A...

196
00:15:44,493 --> 00:15:48,486
...to ensure the jury had Beckwith
sympathizers to keep him out of jail.

197
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:50,858
That's grounds for a new trial.

198
00:15:51,066 --> 00:15:52,158
With all due respect...

199
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:55,701
...those old files have been
leaking out for years.

200
00:15:55,904 --> 00:16:00,136
They only ran background checks which,
while unethical, was not illegal.

201
00:16:00,342 --> 00:16:04,574
We can't prove jury tampering.
I'd like you to meet Bob DeLaughter.

202
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:05,877
How do you do?

203
00:16:06,248 --> 00:16:08,148
-Pleasure.
-Mr. Morris Dees...

204
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:09,874
...the Southern Poverty Law Center.

205
00:16:10,119 --> 00:16:11,814
-How you doing?
-I was explaining...

206
00:16:12,021 --> 00:16:13,818
...that in order for us
to pursue this...

207
00:16:14,023 --> 00:16:16,491
...we'll need more
than an article in a newspaper.

208
00:16:16,692 --> 00:16:18,057
We'll need new evidence.

209
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,160
In 1964, you had
a mountain of evidence.

210
00:16:20,362 --> 00:16:22,159
All you gotta do is retry Beckwith.

211
00:16:22,364 --> 00:16:24,889
On the basis of that alone,
you'll get a conviction.

212
00:16:26,168 --> 00:16:29,399
As you can see, the mountain
has crumbled a bit.

213
00:16:30,539 --> 00:16:31,528
What's this?

214
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:35,437
That's all that's left of the
state's case against De La Beckwith.

215
00:16:35,644 --> 00:16:38,579
Just a few pages
of the old police report.

216
00:16:38,781 --> 00:16:41,579
-Where's the gun? Where--
-Where's the bullet?

217
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:45,684
Where's the original trial transcript?
Where are the files? Beats me.

218
00:16:47,322 --> 00:16:49,119
Are you telling us it is lost?

219
00:16:49,324 --> 00:16:51,189
I'm telling you, we don't have it.

220
00:16:51,493 --> 00:16:52,721
Well, that's outrageous.

221
00:16:53,562 --> 00:16:56,463
Even if we had the evidence,
we'd never get around...

222
00:16:56,665 --> 00:16:59,862
...to the Sixth Amendment right
to a speedy trial.

223
00:17:00,069 --> 00:17:04,062
Mr. Dees would agree that 25 years
isn't exactly what you'd call speedy.

224
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,767
May I see that?

225
00:17:06,975 --> 00:17:09,068
Mrs. Evers, this is
pretty strong stuff.

226
00:17:09,912 --> 00:17:11,140
I'd like to see it.

227
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:23,581
"June 13, 1963.

228
00:17:23,892 --> 00:17:26,224
To the Jackson Police Department:

229
00:17:26,562 --> 00:17:30,430
When you catch whoever killed
the nigger, pin a medal on him...

230
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:34,667
...because he just did Mississippi
one hell of a favor.

231
00:17:35,771 --> 00:17:38,433
June 14, 1963.

232
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,473
A female who refused
to identify herself stated...

233
00:17:41,677 --> 00:17:44,908
...that she'd heard a rumor
that Medgar Evers' wife...

234
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:49,083
...had gotten jealous of Lena Horne,
who appeared with Evers at a rally...

235
00:17:49,284 --> 00:17:52,845
...and might have gotten
her brother-in-law to kill Evers."

236
00:17:55,524 --> 00:17:59,255
Who wouldn't be jealous of Lena Horne?
What a beautiful woman.

237
00:18:00,295 --> 00:18:01,523
Y es, ma'am.

238
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:06,326
The cops wrote that garbage down
because they actually took it seriously.

239
00:18:06,535 --> 00:18:07,467
Mr. Dees.

240
00:18:08,036 --> 00:18:12,200
Do you think the police in Washington,
D.C. would have written it up...

241
00:18:12,407 --> 00:18:16,138
...if some nitwit said Jackie Kennedy
had a hand in J.F.K.'s death...

242
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:19,143
...because her husband ran around
with Marilyn Monroe?

243
00:18:19,381 --> 00:18:20,507
What's your point?

244
00:18:20,716 --> 00:18:23,776
The murder of Medgar Evers
was a race crime...

245
00:18:23,986 --> 00:18:26,011
...a political crime.
An assassination.

246
00:18:26,388 --> 00:18:28,356
Beckwith is free today...

247
00:18:28,557 --> 00:18:31,082
...thanks to a racist jury,
a racist police department...

248
00:18:31,293 --> 00:18:33,454
...and a racist D.A.'s office.

249
00:18:33,662 --> 00:18:36,130
Twenty-five years ago,
Waller and this office...

250
00:18:36,331 --> 00:18:38,458
...went after Beckwith
not once but twice.

251
00:18:38,667 --> 00:18:40,726
I don't need to sit here and listen--

252
00:18:41,436 --> 00:18:44,701
Twenty-five years ago,
I sat on the witness stand...

253
00:18:44,907 --> 00:18:48,138
...and I watched as the former
governor of this state...

254
00:18:48,343 --> 00:18:51,506
...shook hands with the man
who murdered my husband...

255
00:18:52,314 --> 00:18:54,009
...while I was on the stand.

256
00:18:57,085 --> 00:18:58,985
I don't expect you to understand...

257
00:18:59,188 --> 00:19:01,622
...the pain and suffering
my family went through...

258
00:19:01,824 --> 00:19:03,485
...but I did come here thinking...

259
00:19:03,692 --> 00:19:07,389
...that this office might want
to see justice finally served.

260
00:19:10,499 --> 00:19:13,935
You've given me all the reasons
why you can't pursue this.

261
00:19:14,136 --> 00:19:17,264
Perhaps you can find
one reason why you can.

262
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:19,703
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

263
00:19:39,628 --> 00:19:41,118
Ed Peters is a good man...

264
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:43,924
...but as you can see,
we simply don't have a case.

265
00:19:44,132 --> 00:19:47,966
I know you've been living
with this thing for a long while...

266
00:19:48,971 --> 00:19:51,132
...but maybe it's just time you....

267
00:19:52,207 --> 00:19:53,469
Let it go?

268
00:19:54,042 --> 00:19:56,909
I can understand why you'd
think that, Mr. DeLaughter.

269
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:59,478
For years, I said
the same thing to Medgar.

270
00:19:59,681 --> 00:20:02,411
"Let it go.
Let's get out of Mississippi."

271
00:20:02,918 --> 00:20:04,715
Do you know what he said to me?

272
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,811
" I don't know if I'm going
to heaven or to hell...

273
00:20:08,023 --> 00:20:10,150
...but I'm going from Jackson."

274
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:12,556
Good afternoon, Mr. DeLaughter.

275
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:47,192
Hey, everybody, I'm home.

276
00:20:55,604 --> 00:20:56,798
Hey, tiger.

277
00:20:57,472 --> 00:20:58,700
Hi, Dad.

278
00:20:59,641 --> 00:21:03,543
You sure you got enough distractions?
I can go get your Game Boy.

279
00:21:04,146 --> 00:21:05,272
Dad.

280
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,708
Hi, Daddy.

281
00:21:07,149 --> 00:21:08,081
Hi, Dad.

282
00:21:08,283 --> 00:21:12,344
-Did you bring me a lollipop?
-I did. I got one for Claire too.

283
00:21:12,554 --> 00:21:15,523
-Thanks, Daddy.
-How was school today, sweetie?

284
00:21:15,724 --> 00:21:18,022
Did Miss Collins like
the bracelet you made?

285
00:21:18,327 --> 00:21:20,056
Daddy, tell us a story.

286
00:21:20,762 --> 00:21:23,629
-A real scary one.
-Claire, you want to hear a story?

287
00:21:23,832 --> 00:21:25,800
Okay, but not too scary.

288
00:21:26,001 --> 00:21:29,698
Let's go to Mommy and Daddy's room,
because we don't wanna disturb Burt.

289
00:21:33,075 --> 00:21:36,602
-You want something to eat?
-No, I got something at the office.

290
00:21:38,447 --> 00:21:40,176
Thanks for letting me know.

291
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:24,516
Honey, what are you doing up?

292
00:22:24,726 --> 00:22:26,193
I can't sleep.

293
00:22:26,395 --> 00:22:28,056
The ghost is back.

294
00:22:28,463 --> 00:22:30,556
I'll go. I'll go.

295
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:34,601
The ghost is back?
Where is he this time?

296
00:22:34,803 --> 00:22:35,770
In my bed.

297
00:22:35,971 --> 00:22:39,065
Really? We'll just have
to see about that.

298
00:22:42,477 --> 00:22:45,310
You were right.
He's right there on the bed.

299
00:22:46,014 --> 00:22:47,106
No, Daddy.

300
00:22:47,315 --> 00:22:49,476
Now he's over by the window.

301
00:22:51,887 --> 00:22:53,149
I see.

302
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,088
Your bottle tree was
supposed to keep him away.

303
00:22:57,426 --> 00:23:00,088
Maybe I don't have
the right kind of bottles.

304
00:23:00,429 --> 00:23:01,828
You know, baby...

305
00:23:02,898 --> 00:23:05,332
...when we lived in Natchez,
there was a ghost...

306
00:23:05,534 --> 00:23:07,126
...that lived right next door...

307
00:23:07,335 --> 00:23:10,463
...in the remains of this house
that got burned during the war.

308
00:23:10,939 --> 00:23:14,807
And sometimes he'd come over
and get right in my closet.

309
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:16,304
How'd you make him go away?

310
00:23:16,678 --> 00:23:19,078
Granny would come in
and sing a song...

311
00:23:19,281 --> 00:23:21,306
...and before you knew it,
he was gone.

312
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:23,608
What'd she sing?

313
00:23:24,052 --> 00:23:26,919
She sang the song every ghost
from Mississippi loves.

314
00:23:27,422 --> 00:23:28,514
Sing it, Daddy.

315
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:30,184
All right.

316
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:34,688
I wish I was in the land of cotton

317
00:23:34,896 --> 00:23:37,126
Old times there are not forgotten

318
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:38,629
Look away

319
00:23:38,934 --> 00:23:40,265
Look away

320
00:23:40,535 --> 00:23:43,834
Look away, Dixieland

321
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:46,371
In Dixieland where I was born

322
00:23:46,708 --> 00:23:49,336
Early on one frosty morn'

323
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:52,306
Look away, look away

324
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:55,642
Look away, Dixieland

325
00:23:56,218 --> 00:23:58,448
Oh, I wish I was in Dixie

326
00:23:58,653 --> 00:24:01,417
Hooray, hooray

327
00:24:01,623 --> 00:24:04,319
In Dixieland I'll take my stand

328
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:07,495
To live and die in Dixie

329
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,789
Away, away

330
00:24:10,065 --> 00:24:12,659
Away down South

331
00:24:13,101 --> 00:24:14,932
In Dixie

332
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:21,272
I'd ask what's new,
but I'm afraid you'd tell me.

333
00:24:21,476 --> 00:24:24,036
My readers are on the edge
of their collective seat.

334
00:24:25,413 --> 00:24:26,880
Will Mr. DeLaughter go after
Byron De La Beckwith?

335
00:24:27,082 --> 00:24:31,485
The D.A.'s office will investigate
the possibility of reopening the case.

336
00:24:31,686 --> 00:24:35,053
I didn't go to law school,
but that sounds like bullshit.

337
00:24:35,257 --> 00:24:36,315
Nice talking to you.

338
00:24:36,525 --> 00:24:38,015
Have a nice day.

339
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:03,017
Can you tell me how I can get
ahold of Lewis Skinner...

340
00:25:03,218 --> 00:25:04,310
...or Fred Sanders?

341
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:08,751
If you want Lewis Skinner, you'll need
a shovel and six hours of digging time.

342
00:25:09,157 --> 00:25:10,283
What's Fred's status?

343
00:25:10,492 --> 00:25:13,222
As far as I know,
he's still aboveground.

344
00:25:14,863 --> 00:25:17,388
Back in '63,
none of those houses were there.

345
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:19,590
That was all vacant lot.

346
00:25:19,801 --> 00:25:22,736
And this here was
all covered over with brush.

347
00:25:22,971 --> 00:25:26,031
I got out here eight minutes
after the call came in.

348
00:25:26,241 --> 00:25:30,473
The way Mrs. Evers yelled at me,
you'd think I was the one who done it.

349
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:35,912
This is where they found the gun,
hidden in some honeysuckle vines.

350
00:25:36,384 --> 00:25:38,443
Any idea where
that gun might be today?

351
00:25:38,653 --> 00:25:39,711
Hell, no.

352
00:25:39,921 --> 00:25:41,013
Back in those days...

353
00:25:41,223 --> 00:25:44,818
...evidence had a habit
of disappearing after the trials.

354
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:46,419
Look at that.

355
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:49,756
My grandmother could have
picked Evers off from over here.

356
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:51,865
That's where he was shot.

357
00:25:52,067 --> 00:25:54,592
That big tree wasn't there
at the time.

358
00:25:54,936 --> 00:25:56,460
There was blood everywhere.

359
00:25:56,671 --> 00:25:59,572
All over the driveway,
all over the car.

360
00:25:59,774 --> 00:26:02,140
It was as if somebody
had butchered a hog.

361
00:26:02,377 --> 00:26:07,110
But Evers must've been one hell of a
strong man because somehow he managed...

362
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:09,647
...to drag himself
all the way up to his door.

363
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:13,978
After that bullet tore through his back,
it slammed through that window...

364
00:26:14,189 --> 00:26:15,656
...crashed through a wall...

365
00:26:15,857 --> 00:26:19,725
...ricocheted off the refrigerator
and busted the coffeepot.

366
00:26:19,928 --> 00:26:24,024
We found it on the kitchen counter
next to a watermelon.

367
00:26:25,367 --> 00:26:26,459
You're kidding me.

368
00:26:26,868 --> 00:26:28,096
No, sir.

369
00:26:33,074 --> 00:26:34,439
Did he have any kids?

370
00:26:34,643 --> 00:26:38,977
If my memory serves, I believe there
were three little ones there that night.

371
00:26:43,385 --> 00:26:47,947
What kind of man shoots another man
in the back in front of his family?

372
00:26:49,124 --> 00:26:51,649
I love the land of my birth.

373
00:26:52,427 --> 00:26:55,021
I do not mean
just America as a country...

374
00:26:55,263 --> 00:26:56,787
...but Mississippi...

375
00:26:56,998 --> 00:26:58,659
... the state in which I was born.

376
00:26:59,768 --> 00:27:02,794
So the deplorable things
I speak of here today...

377
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:05,336
... will be said to you
in hopes of a future...

378
00:27:06,107 --> 00:27:09,338
... where such will not
be the case in Mississippi.

379
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:11,307
In the horrific deaths...

380
00:27:11,513 --> 00:27:13,003
...of Emmett Till...

381
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:15,576
...Reverend G. W. Lee...

382
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:18,680
...Lamar Smith and a variety
of other atrocities...

383
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:21,321
...no one has been convicted.

384
00:27:21,923 --> 00:27:26,690
And we feel those guilty of having
committed these ungodly acts...

385
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:30,456
...had the feeling of assurance
that nothing ever would be done.

386
00:27:30,765 --> 00:27:33,029
For you see, ladies and gentlemen...

387
00:27:33,668 --> 00:27:37,900
... white juries have yet to convict
a white man in Mississippi...

388
00:27:38,173 --> 00:27:40,698
...guilty of a crime against a Negro.

389
00:27:41,476 --> 00:27:46,072
The failure of the so-called decent
or moderate white person...

390
00:27:46,281 --> 00:27:49,717
... to take a positive
and uncompromising stand....

391
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:51,180
Who's that?

392
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:54,119
Medgar Evers.

393
00:27:57,225 --> 00:27:58,852
Why are you looking at it?

394
00:28:00,995 --> 00:28:04,453
I just wanted to get
an idea of who he was.

395
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,866
I'd like to get
an idea of who you are.

396
00:28:08,503 --> 00:28:10,232
What's that supposed to mean?

397
00:28:10,972 --> 00:28:13,440
I was willing to go down
that road with you...

398
00:28:13,641 --> 00:28:16,701
...when you got out of law school
and did that pro bono work.

399
00:28:16,911 --> 00:28:20,438
And when you worked for
that Jew lawyer who ran you ragged.

400
00:28:20,915 --> 00:28:24,715
I minded a little when you turned down
that offer from Morse & Braggs...

401
00:28:24,919 --> 00:28:27,786
...so you could be assistant D.A.
at one-fourth the salary.

402
00:28:27,989 --> 00:28:31,356
But I'll be damned if I spent
10 years supporting your career...

403
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:32,958
...just so you can humiliate me.

404
00:28:33,561 --> 00:28:35,825
You're gonna pursue this, aren't you?

405
00:28:36,831 --> 00:28:39,891
You're gonna humiliate me
in front of my friends...

406
00:28:40,101 --> 00:28:42,194
...my family and the entire state.

407
00:28:42,404 --> 00:28:44,429
I'm just looking
at a couple of tapes.

408
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:47,564
Fine. Look at your tapes.

409
00:28:47,876 --> 00:28:49,605
That's all you'd better do.

410
00:28:55,216 --> 00:28:56,774
-Why not?
-Because you can't win.

411
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:57,815
Who says?

412
00:28:58,086 --> 00:29:00,919
-The Sixth Amendment.
-Suppose I could get around it.

413
00:29:01,122 --> 00:29:04,387
It's one thing for
the grieving widow to carry on--

414
00:29:04,793 --> 00:29:08,695
Suppose an argument could be made
that the Sixth Amendment doesn't apply.

415
00:29:08,897 --> 00:29:10,421
You want to retry Beckwith?

416
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:11,597
Fine.

417
00:29:11,866 --> 00:29:16,667
Dig up 26-year-old physical evidence
which probably no longer exists...

418
00:29:17,105 --> 00:29:21,235
...identify it, and then you'll have
to locate the key witnesses...

419
00:29:21,443 --> 00:29:24,207
...who, if you find them,
are probably dead or senile.

420
00:29:24,412 --> 00:29:26,880
Their testimony could be read
from the transcript.

421
00:29:27,081 --> 00:29:30,778
We haven't seen a certified
transcript in over 25 years.

422
00:29:30,985 --> 00:29:33,510
-What if I found one?
-Let's say, by some miracle...

423
00:29:33,721 --> 00:29:37,282
...you found one, got an indictment.
Then by some greater miracle...

424
00:29:37,492 --> 00:29:41,656
...the state Supreme Court and U.S.
Supreme Court didn't throw it out...

425
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:44,525
...and you actually got to trial.
What if you lose?

426
00:29:44,732 --> 00:29:48,668
The whole state, which is supposed
to have changed so much...

427
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:51,566
...will be facing the worst
public relations disaster...

428
00:29:51,773 --> 00:29:55,038
...since that black kid, Emmett Till,
bobbed up out of the river.

429
00:30:00,682 --> 00:30:02,912
Are you telling me
I can't go after this?

430
00:30:03,117 --> 00:30:05,347
I'm telling you
you're dealing with the past.

431
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:07,987
Mississippi's not
a place you wanna be.

432
00:30:12,694 --> 00:30:15,822
Hopefully, Jerry Mitchell can
keep this thing alive for us.

433
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:19,261
Jerry Mitchell's fine, but
what we need is national press.

434
00:30:19,467 --> 00:30:24,029
Darrell, CNN won't run a major story
about how the D.A. of Hinds County...

435
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:27,208
...is refusing to re-prosecute a case...

436
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:29,399
...that's a quarter of a century old.

437
00:30:29,611 --> 00:30:32,171
Stop annoying your grandmama.

438
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:36,578
The greatest joy in your mother's life
is being annoyed by her grandchildren.

439
00:30:36,784 --> 00:30:39,218
Next to being annoyed by you, Walter.

440
00:30:39,954 --> 00:30:40,921
I'll get it.

441
00:30:41,122 --> 00:30:43,181
I'm not here no matter who it is.

442
00:30:49,464 --> 00:30:50,488
Who?

443
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,163
Just a minute, please.

444
00:30:55,003 --> 00:30:56,698
I want you to eat those beans.

445
00:30:56,905 --> 00:30:58,600
It's long distance from Jackson.

446
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,741
A man by the name of DeLaughter.
You want me to take it?

447
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:03,808
No, I'll take it.

448
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:05,773
Eat those beans.

449
00:31:06,548 --> 00:31:08,448
I don't eat beans.

450
00:31:13,721 --> 00:31:14,881
Hello, Mrs. Evers.

451
00:31:15,089 --> 00:31:18,320
I know you probably left here
feeling pretty discouraged...

452
00:31:18,526 --> 00:31:21,893
...but I hope you understand
Mr. Peters was just being realistic.

453
00:31:22,096 --> 00:31:23,757
I understand perfectly.

454
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:25,330
I also wanted you to know...

455
00:31:25,533 --> 00:31:28,366
...that we are going to
be keeping this case open.

456
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:32,432
Mrs. Evers?

457
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,803
Did it suddenly occur to
Mr. Peters that he'd better...

458
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:39,946
...start making nice with the
black community before November?

459
00:31:40,515 --> 00:31:42,676
-Mrs. Evers--
-He made it clear to me...

460
00:31:42,917 --> 00:31:46,114
...that in addition to having
no evidence and no witnesses...

461
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:47,982
...he also had no interest.

462
00:31:48,222 --> 00:31:52,454
Looking into this wasn't so much
Mr. Peter's idea as it was mine.

463
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,821
-Yours?
-Yes, ma'am.

464
00:31:57,398 --> 00:32:00,993
Judge Russel Moore was perhaps
the most racist judge...

465
00:32:01,202 --> 00:32:03,466
...in the history
of the state of Mississippi.

466
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:06,606
Why would his son-in-law
be interested in this case?

467
00:32:06,874 --> 00:32:10,640
Mrs. Evers, I'm 37 years old,
just like Medgar was...

468
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:13,177
...and I've got three kids,
like he did.

469
00:32:13,581 --> 00:32:16,175
I was 11 years old
when your husband was killed...

470
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:18,511
...and I hardly remember him at all.

471
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:23,684
But I went by your house the other day
and I could see him there...

472
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:26,356
...watering his lawn...

473
00:32:26,928 --> 00:32:28,691
... working on his roof...

474
00:32:29,497 --> 00:32:31,431
...playing with his children.

475
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:36,093
No man has the right to take
another man away from his children.

476
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:40,534
I appreciate the call,
Mr. DeLaughter.

477
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:43,109
I'll keep in touch, Mrs. Evers.

478
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:50,411
Did you plan on telling me...

479
00:32:50,952 --> 00:32:53,614
...or was I just gonna read
about it in the papers?

480
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:58,556
We should be at the
Walkers' house in 15 minutes.

481
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:02,791
Well, I've got a lot
of work to do here.

482
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:08,266
Suit yourself.

483
00:33:13,374 --> 00:33:16,275
Nobody gives a goddamn
what Byron De La Beckwith did...

484
00:33:16,477 --> 00:33:18,741
...to some Medgar Evers 26 years ago.

485
00:33:18,946 --> 00:33:22,814
Hell, Larry Smith got shot down
in his own driveway just last week.

486
00:33:23,117 --> 00:33:24,880
And it wasn't for no civil rights.

487
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:26,883
It was for his spare change.

488
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:31,115
I could have had any investigator
I wanted, and I asked for you.

489
00:33:31,325 --> 00:33:33,293
Am I meant to be flattered by that?

490
00:33:33,494 --> 00:33:38,227
We're supposed to nail Eddie Williams
for killing Wendell Washington...

491
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:41,266
...or that guy Pierson
for shooting Donny Brown.

492
00:33:41,469 --> 00:33:45,633
That's why we're only gonna work
on this case in our spare time.

493
00:34:04,325 --> 00:34:05,155
Holy shit.

494
00:34:06,327 --> 00:34:07,453
Will you look at this?

495
00:34:07,695 --> 00:34:12,223
You could buy a whole damn General
Electric refrigerator for $185.

496
00:34:14,669 --> 00:34:16,330
T alk about your good old days.

497
00:34:34,222 --> 00:34:35,280
That's my daddy.

498
00:34:37,592 --> 00:34:39,924
I didn't know he was on the force too.

499
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:42,994
Sure. Detective L.C. Bennett.

500
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:47,832
He was there when they found Beckwith's
rifle, but I've never seen this.

501
00:34:48,035 --> 00:34:49,730
John Goza is dead.

502
00:34:49,937 --> 00:34:51,461
Herbert Speight is dead.

503
00:34:51,906 --> 00:34:54,602
B.L. Pittman is dead.

504
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:56,207
Is anybody alive?

505
00:34:56,444 --> 00:34:57,934
This is pointless.

506
00:35:00,715 --> 00:35:02,182
It's Jerry Mitchell.

507
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:04,950
Jerry.

508
00:35:05,887 --> 00:35:07,514
I don't have the gun yet.

509
00:35:07,722 --> 00:35:11,658
I don't have anything. If I find
the gun, you'll be the first to know.

510
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,328
-Pain in my ass.
-It's funny.

511
00:35:14,562 --> 00:35:17,588
I came by to see if you could
use some help on this case...

512
00:35:17,799 --> 00:35:20,029
...and you've got a picture of my daddy.

513
00:35:20,234 --> 00:35:21,997
We sure could use some help.

514
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:24,296
Can you bring people
back from the dead?

515
00:35:25,306 --> 00:35:28,833
You're joking, but that's
exactly what we have to do.

516
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:31,511
We have to make the past
start living again.

517
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:33,907
This whole case is one big resurrection.

518
00:35:34,115 --> 00:35:36,515
I want you to go through
all the literature...

519
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:39,015
...from every organization
Beckwith was part of:

520
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:43,179
White Citizens Council,
Sons of the American Revolution, KKK.

521
00:35:43,424 --> 00:35:45,324
Good, I always loved homework.

522
00:35:45,526 --> 00:35:48,461
We'll start by paying
these boys a little visit.

523
00:35:48,663 --> 00:35:49,960
-Who's that?
-Two cops.

524
00:35:50,164 --> 00:35:53,930
They saw Beckwith 90 miles away
at the time of the murder.

525
00:35:54,168 --> 00:35:57,660
You think Holley and Cresswell
will admit they lied under oath?

526
00:35:58,339 --> 00:36:01,240
Time has a way of cleaning up
people's memories.

527
00:36:08,449 --> 00:36:10,508
I love the Delta.

528
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:12,912
It's the best place on earth.

529
00:36:14,388 --> 00:36:15,685
If you're a mosquito.

530
00:36:20,795 --> 00:36:23,093
-T ake care now.
-Thank you, Mr. Holley.

531
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:27,734
Sometimes you can't win for losing.

532
00:36:28,002 --> 00:36:30,869
I asked you boys
to meet me out here...

533
00:36:31,072 --> 00:36:35,304
...so as to avoid running
into any of my constituents.

534
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:39,405
How long have you been
an alderman up here, Mr. Holley?

535
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:42,146
Must be going on about five years.

536
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:43,710
I'll tell you this:

537
00:36:43,918 --> 00:36:48,378
If word got out that I testified
on behalf of Byron De La Beckwith....

538
00:36:48,756 --> 00:36:52,283
I suppose, in a way, your boss
and me got the same problem.

539
00:36:52,493 --> 00:36:53,460
Sir?

540
00:36:53,728 --> 00:36:55,389
If we want to keep our jobs...

541
00:36:55,596 --> 00:36:58,394
...we'll have to kiss
an awful lot of black behind.

542
00:37:01,903 --> 00:37:03,302
Mr. Holley...

543
00:37:03,838 --> 00:37:07,968
...Evers was killed shortly after
midnight, 90 miles away in Jackson.

544
00:37:08,175 --> 00:37:10,507
There's no way the killer
could have been here...

545
00:37:10,745 --> 00:37:12,713
...at 1 a.m. pumping gas.

546
00:37:13,014 --> 00:37:15,608
No, sir, that'd be impossible.

547
00:37:15,816 --> 00:37:20,310
It was a long while ago, but I'd like
you to think back and tell me...

548
00:37:20,521 --> 00:37:22,318
...are you sure about the time...

549
00:37:22,523 --> 00:37:24,923
...you saw Mr. Beckwith
at that gas station?

550
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:27,157
This old memory of mine...

551
00:37:27,361 --> 00:37:30,728
...gets worse and worse
with each passing year...

552
00:37:30,932 --> 00:37:33,560
...but there's two things
I am pretty sure about:

553
00:37:33,768 --> 00:37:36,396
It was approximately 1:03
in the morning...

554
00:37:36,604 --> 00:37:39,835
...and old Delay was gassing up
that Valiant of his.

555
00:37:41,776 --> 00:37:43,676
Lying son of a bitch.

556
00:37:43,945 --> 00:37:46,140
You thought you'd hear
something different?

557
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:48,872
Maybe we'll have better luck
with his partner.

558
00:37:49,784 --> 00:37:51,649
Y'all wanna subpoena me...

559
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:53,911
...then you go right ahead and do it.

560
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:57,783
But if I see you,
Byron De La Beckwith...

561
00:37:57,992 --> 00:38:00,517
...or the blackest nigger
in this country...

562
00:38:00,728 --> 00:38:03,492
...putting gas in his car
at the time of a murder...

563
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:05,529
...then that's what I'll say.

564
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:08,566
I'd say he's in our camp.

565
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:19,171
I wish I had better news
for her today.

566
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,642
Who's that?

567
00:38:21,282 --> 00:38:22,544
Mrs. Evers.

568
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:25,018
Fill it up for me, would you, buddy?

569
00:38:25,353 --> 00:38:29,119
I call her every Friday and let her
know how the case is progressing.

570
00:38:29,357 --> 00:38:32,224
Got a flash for you.
This case ain't progressing.

571
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:36,219
I think about her keeping
this thing alive all this time.

572
00:38:36,964 --> 00:38:40,058
Imagine a woman loving a man so much.

573
00:38:42,503 --> 00:38:45,495
I can't even get a woman
to love me while I'm still alive.

574
00:38:45,706 --> 00:38:47,606
Know what I did after my last divorce?

575
00:38:47,842 --> 00:38:49,434
I took up golf.

576
00:38:49,643 --> 00:38:53,807
Man needs a hobby to occupy his mind,
or he'll start doing crazy things...

577
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:55,742
...Iike drinking too much...

578
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:59,852
...or chasing 26-year-old murder cases
across the Mississippi Delta.

579
00:39:08,195 --> 00:39:10,891
I told you I'd call you every Friday.

580
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:14,295
And it's Friday, Mrs. Evers,
so I'm calling.

581
00:39:14,535 --> 00:39:17,299
This really isn't necessary.

582
00:39:17,538 --> 00:39:20,837
It's important to me you know
we're doing what we can.

583
00:39:21,042 --> 00:39:23,033
I wish I had better news
for you today...

584
00:39:23,244 --> 00:39:26,702
...but we still haven't been able
to locate the autopsy report.

585
00:39:26,914 --> 00:39:29,144
Most of the physical evidence
is still missing.

586
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:32,749
A number of the witnesses have died,
which really hurts us...

587
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:36,855
...and we've had no luck finding
the original trial transcript.

588
00:39:37,058 --> 00:39:40,027
I've just spoke with
both Holley and Cresswell...

589
00:39:40,227 --> 00:39:41,922
...and they're sticking
by their stories.

590
00:39:42,596 --> 00:39:47,465
I'm sure as the assistant
district attorney of Hinds County...

591
00:39:47,668 --> 00:39:49,932
...you're doing everything
in your power...

592
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:52,128
...to see that justice is done.

593
00:39:57,978 --> 00:39:59,343
I'll call you next Friday.

594
00:39:59,747 --> 00:40:02,443
I'll be on pins and needles till then.

595
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:16,045
I waited for you to come home.

596
00:41:19,093 --> 00:41:21,493
I'm not taking the children with me.

597
00:41:23,697 --> 00:41:26,666
I just need to be
on my own for a while.

598
00:41:43,984 --> 00:41:47,044
I was just wondering
when we stopped loving each other.

599
00:41:49,557 --> 00:41:50,854
I don't know.

600
00:41:55,196 --> 00:41:56,754
What happened, Bobby?

601
00:41:59,833 --> 00:42:01,425
People change.

602
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:05,705
You saying I've changed?

603
00:42:07,508 --> 00:42:09,703
I'm saying you haven't.

604
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:29,657
-It's a beautiful area, Mr. Beckwith.
-It's heaven on earth.

605
00:42:29,863 --> 00:42:32,093
Of course, like everywhere else...

606
00:42:32,433 --> 00:42:35,527
... we do get the occasional
stray nigger moving in.

607
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:38,538
But their houses always
seem to burn down.

608
00:42:38,772 --> 00:42:42,230
You know how careless niggers are
with their cigarettes.

609
00:42:43,344 --> 00:42:45,335
A real beauty.

610
00:42:45,546 --> 00:42:48,674
-Where'd you get this?
-Ed Bryson at Channel 3.

611
00:42:48,882 --> 00:42:51,077
They're running a piece on Beckwith.

612
00:42:51,285 --> 00:42:52,252
Do you think...

613
00:42:52,486 --> 00:42:55,717
...it's a crime for a white man
to kill a black man?

614
00:42:55,923 --> 00:43:00,155
God put the white man here
to rule over all the dusky races.

615
00:43:00,361 --> 00:43:02,295
It says so in the Bible.

616
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:03,929
Is there a chance...

617
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:07,622
... you'd be indicted again
for the murder of Medgar Evers?

618
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:11,737
Why would I be?
Do you know of any new evidence?

619
00:43:11,939 --> 00:43:13,099
-Are you a Jew?
-Catholic.

620
00:43:13,307 --> 00:43:15,571
I told you, I won't talk to no Jew.

621
00:43:15,776 --> 00:43:18,574
Anybody who knows anything
about Jews and niggers...

622
00:43:18,779 --> 00:43:21,873
...knows that Jews put the niggers
up to all this foolishness.

623
00:43:22,116 --> 00:43:26,416
This CORE and SNCC and NAACP.

624
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:28,154
If you were indicted again?

625
00:43:28,555 --> 00:43:31,581
Well, I'm just gonna
tend to my business...

626
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:33,417
...Iike I always have.

627
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:37,152
I'm gonna look out
for my God, my family...

628
00:43:37,364 --> 00:43:39,764
...and the whole state
of Christ's church.

629
00:43:40,067 --> 00:43:42,831
That don't encompass anybody
but white Christians.

630
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:44,664
All these other...

631
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:48,035
...races and colors
and creeds and sissies...

632
00:43:48,242 --> 00:43:51,336
... they are anti-Christs.
See, many of them...

633
00:43:51,545 --> 00:43:54,673
...believe in human sacrifices
and voodoo and such.

634
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:57,578
According to your way
of thinking...

635
00:43:57,818 --> 00:44:00,719
...how could justice be done
in the Medgar Evers murder?

636
00:44:02,623 --> 00:44:04,853
First, find out
who killed the nigger.

637
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:06,686
Then you just...

638
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:09,622
...do whatever the law says
that you can do...

639
00:44:09,830 --> 00:44:12,196
...if you're big enough to do it.

640
00:44:12,833 --> 00:44:14,892
He's daring us to get him.

641
00:44:15,602 --> 00:44:18,366
-We still ain't got nothing.
-I know what you'll say.

642
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:21,473
-Did I kill Medgar Evers?
-Did you?

643
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:23,369
I did not kill him.

644
00:44:24,378 --> 00:44:26,539
But he sure is dead.

645
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:29,346
And he ain't coming back.

646
00:44:30,284 --> 00:44:32,844
What did you think when
you heard he'd been killed?

647
00:44:33,153 --> 00:44:35,121
I didn't shed a tear.

648
00:44:35,322 --> 00:44:36,346
No, sir.

649
00:44:41,195 --> 00:44:45,222
Here. The latest literary efforts
from the "Hate Group of the Month" Club.

650
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:47,791
For people who got one thing
on their minds...

651
00:44:48,001 --> 00:44:50,697
...they got a lot of ways
to tell you about it.

652
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:55,469
I wonder what old Judge Moore
would think about all this.

653
00:44:55,709 --> 00:44:57,870
Dixie still living with her mom?

654
00:44:59,646 --> 00:45:01,079
Shit, I'm late!

655
00:45:01,548 --> 00:45:03,539
Hot off the presses. Armed robbery.

656
00:45:03,884 --> 00:45:07,650
A guy named Spratlin held up
Crechelle's, got away with $3800...

657
00:45:07,921 --> 00:45:10,549
-...and an order of onion rings.
-I'll take care of it.

658
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:12,258
Where you going?

659
00:45:12,459 --> 00:45:15,087
-I said I'd be home by 6.
-What about the Owens case?

660
00:45:15,396 --> 00:45:18,058
-The assault with the baseball bat.
-No, the carjacking.

661
00:45:18,265 --> 00:45:20,028
Right. I'm on top of it.

662
00:45:20,234 --> 00:45:22,794
You want this Evers thing
to be your life's work...

663
00:45:23,003 --> 00:45:24,937
...but there's cases that
occurred in this decade.

664
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:26,231
I promise.

665
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:29,340
This office can't keep covering
for you with the judges.

666
00:45:29,576 --> 00:45:32,238
-You'd best be in court tomorrow.
-I'll be there.

667
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:40,245
Daddy...

668
00:45:40,754 --> 00:45:43,951
...how come Grandpa Russel
would be mad at you?

669
00:45:46,059 --> 00:45:49,586
Mommy said Grandpa Russel
would be mad at you.

670
00:45:50,230 --> 00:45:52,630
Great. What else did Mommy say?

671
00:45:52,866 --> 00:45:56,165
She said that you're doing something
that Grandpa won't like.

672
00:45:57,271 --> 00:45:58,670
Yeah, well....

673
00:45:59,907 --> 00:46:01,431
What are you doing?

674
00:46:11,351 --> 00:46:14,377
Grandpa Russel and I didn't
always agree on things.

675
00:46:14,755 --> 00:46:15,949
What things?

676
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:20,152
Let's see, how can I explain this?

677
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:24,461
Explain it.

678
00:46:25,399 --> 00:46:26,525
Right.

679
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:30,534
You know how sometimes
people can just be different?

680
00:46:30,804 --> 00:46:31,998
Like how?

681
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:34,299
Grandpa used to eat pig's knuckles.

682
00:46:35,275 --> 00:46:37,607
That's how I feel.
See, we're different.

683
00:46:37,811 --> 00:46:39,836
Grandpa used to like to build things.

684
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:43,608
I can't build anything,
but I like to work in the garden.

685
00:46:43,851 --> 00:46:47,582
Grandpa had guns all over his house,
and we don't have any guns.

686
00:46:48,155 --> 00:46:49,144
I have a gun.

687
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:51,823
Yours is a nuclear-powered laser gun.

688
00:46:52,025 --> 00:46:54,619
I'm talking about
handguns and rifles.

689
00:46:56,763 --> 00:46:57,695
Holy shit!

690
00:46:57,898 --> 00:46:58,956
Claire, watch Drew!

691
00:46:59,166 --> 00:47:00,258
Holy shit.

692
00:47:00,501 --> 00:47:02,025
Don't say that.
That's a bad word.

693
00:47:08,275 --> 00:47:09,299
Benny?

694
00:47:09,510 --> 00:47:13,640
Sanders said something about
evidence disappearing after trials.

695
00:47:13,847 --> 00:47:15,838
Do you know anything about that?

696
00:47:16,550 --> 00:47:19,610
My daddy told me that kind of thing
happened all the time.

697
00:47:19,820 --> 00:47:24,757
People used to take stuff as souvenirs.
You know, lawyers, bailiffs, clerks.

698
00:47:25,292 --> 00:47:27,089
How about judges?

699
00:47:28,495 --> 00:47:29,393
That's true.

700
00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:32,292
I'm afraid I won't
be able to play Tuesday.

701
00:47:32,499 --> 00:47:35,525
We have a round robin at the club,
and I promised Lou Ann.

702
00:47:38,038 --> 00:47:40,734
Honey, don't worry about it.
I'll call Charlynne.

703
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:43,466
If she can't make it, I'll get Louise.

704
00:47:43,677 --> 00:47:48,376
Sugar, play that jack of clubs for me
there, if you would. Please, ma'am.

705
00:47:49,883 --> 00:47:51,544
Hi, Grandma.

706
00:47:51,785 --> 00:47:55,084
What are you doing here?
Dixie's not here.

707
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:57,985
I thought you'd enjoy
a visit from your grandkids.

708
00:47:58,191 --> 00:48:02,594
Darlin', it's my bridge night tonight.
Drew! Come here.

709
00:48:02,796 --> 00:48:05,026
Well, we can't stay but a minute.

710
00:48:05,265 --> 00:48:09,031
Remember that rifle Judge Moore used
to hold open the door to his study?

711
00:48:09,236 --> 00:48:11,568
Have you seen that around anywhere?

712
00:48:11,939 --> 00:48:13,930
Ladies, y'all know Bobby.

713
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:16,041
That's Marilyn and Jill and Leah.

714
00:48:16,276 --> 00:48:20,508
I won't keep you from your game.
Go ahead and I'll be right back.

715
00:48:20,747 --> 00:48:23,443
Now, what is he doing here, Caroline?

716
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:26,752
He's looking for a gun.

717
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:36,455
I don't appreciate
your roaming around.

718
00:48:36,663 --> 00:48:40,190
I want you coming down
those stairs now, and leave.

719
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:45,201
I spent many a happy hour up here
arguing the law with your husband.

720
00:48:45,472 --> 00:48:48,703
And if he knew what you were up to
with this Evers nonsense...

721
00:48:48,909 --> 00:48:51,207
...that man would
turn over in his grave.

722
00:48:51,511 --> 00:48:53,604
I said that to myself just this morning.

723
00:48:54,514 --> 00:48:56,982
Dixie always said
that you were crazy as hell.

724
00:48:57,217 --> 00:48:58,741
Maybe she did have a point.

725
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:00,278
I love you...

726
00:49:00,854 --> 00:49:03,652
...but you and Dixie aren't
any more right for each other...

727
00:49:03,857 --> 00:49:05,449
...than the man in the moon.

728
00:49:07,961 --> 00:49:10,122
I'll go back
and resume my bridge game.

729
00:49:11,698 --> 00:49:13,791
You go on ahead.
I'll be right down.

730
00:49:16,803 --> 00:49:19,931
It's best if you come on
back down with me right now.

731
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:21,072
I prefer it.

732
00:49:28,115 --> 00:49:30,379
Be careful. It could be loaded.

733
00:49:30,584 --> 00:49:32,518
-Hold on to that.
-What are you doing?

734
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:35,620
-Checking this serial number.
-I love my grandchildren.

735
00:49:35,822 --> 00:49:39,724
-A little bit higher.
-It's inappropriate to march in here...

736
00:49:39,993 --> 00:49:42,894
...and you expect me to just let you....

737
00:49:43,096 --> 00:49:44,085
What?

738
00:49:45,332 --> 00:49:47,391
I love you, Caroline.

739
00:49:48,335 --> 00:49:51,361
-You're full of shit.
-I logged it in the evidence locker.

740
00:49:51,571 --> 00:49:53,971
-Logged what in?
-The gun that killed Medgar Evers.

741
00:49:54,174 --> 00:49:55,801
-You're full of shit.
-Who?

742
00:49:56,009 --> 00:49:57,874
He says he found the gun.

743
00:49:58,345 --> 00:50:01,280
-You're full of shit.
-That's something to tell Mrs. Evers.

744
00:50:01,481 --> 00:50:04,075
I'm not gonna tell Mrs. Evers.

745
00:50:05,352 --> 00:50:08,480
You've been making those Friday calls
so she'd trust you.

746
00:50:08,689 --> 00:50:13,592
-lf she finds out....
-I can't have her find out.

747
00:50:13,794 --> 00:50:15,421
This can't leave the office.

748
00:50:15,996 --> 00:50:20,433
The only way we're gonna get a new
indictment is if we find something...

749
00:50:20,634 --> 00:50:23,398
...they didn't have 27 years ago.

750
00:50:23,603 --> 00:50:26,936
The way I see it, that something
will come from Beckwith.

751
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:29,040
Right now,
he's on his mountaintop...

752
00:50:29,242 --> 00:50:32,234
...shooting his mouth off
to anyone who'll listen.

753
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:35,813
No telling what incriminating thing's
liable to come out of that man.

754
00:50:36,149 --> 00:50:38,845
But if he knows we have
something like this...

755
00:50:39,052 --> 00:50:41,282
...he'll know we're serious
and clam up.

756
00:50:41,488 --> 00:50:44,514
I doubt that Beckwith and Myrlie
speak all that often.

757
00:50:44,791 --> 00:50:47,089
Myrlie speaks to Jerry Mitchell.

758
00:50:47,594 --> 00:50:50,119
Jerry Mitchell speaks to the world.

759
00:51:01,708 --> 00:51:04,438
"You best stop wasting
our taxpayers' money.

760
00:51:04,644 --> 00:51:06,578
Enjoy your drive home."

761
00:51:07,214 --> 00:51:10,650
Nice to see Jackson still
has some concerned citizens.

762
00:51:12,219 --> 00:51:15,586
Well, heck, son,
what did you expect?

763
00:51:16,089 --> 00:51:19,388
I expect people to act like
decent, law-abiding citizens.

764
00:51:19,593 --> 00:51:21,584
This is 1990, for crying out loud.

765
00:51:21,795 --> 00:51:26,459
Of course it is. And we got blacks
and whites playing ball together...

766
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:30,762
...and on the police force,
in the government, on TV.

767
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:35,403
We are a fully evolved society.
Aren't we, son?

768
00:51:38,411 --> 00:51:39,708
Let me tell you something:

769
00:51:40,147 --> 00:51:44,140
This country may be legally
integrated, but emotionally...

770
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:46,876
...we will always be segregated.

771
00:51:47,087 --> 00:51:49,248
I don't know that I accept that.

772
00:51:49,756 --> 00:51:50,848
Of course not.

773
00:51:51,091 --> 00:51:52,786
You're Bobby DeLaughter...

774
00:51:52,993 --> 00:51:56,019
...Mississippi's self-appointed
new civil rights leader.

775
00:51:56,563 --> 00:51:57,552
Barney...

776
00:51:57,831 --> 00:51:59,628
...do we have to talk about this?

777
00:51:59,833 --> 00:52:02,028
No, we do not.

778
00:52:03,403 --> 00:52:06,395
Who all wants some of your
grandpa's famous baby backs?

779
00:52:06,606 --> 00:52:08,198
I do! I do!

780
00:52:19,052 --> 00:52:20,542
You're my son.

781
00:52:21,021 --> 00:52:22,648
I don't want you to get hurt.

782
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:27,959
In Jackson, Mississippi

783
00:52:28,962 --> 00:52:32,398
In 1963

784
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:36,430
There lived a man

785
00:52:36,636 --> 00:52:37,762
Who was brave

786
00:52:39,973 --> 00:52:43,966
He fought for freedom

787
00:52:44,978 --> 00:52:46,309
Hello, Mrs. Evers?

788
00:52:46,613 --> 00:52:47,841
It's Bobby DeLaughter.

789
00:52:48,615 --> 00:52:50,947
Nothing earth shattering, no.

790
00:52:51,284 --> 00:52:53,445
We've located all the witnesses...

791
00:52:53,653 --> 00:52:56,679
...but without the original
trial transcript...

792
00:52:56,890 --> 00:52:58,881
...it's tough piecing the case together.

793
00:53:00,393 --> 00:53:02,224
No, ma'am, that's about it.

794
00:53:03,129 --> 00:53:06,690
-I wish I had more to report.
-Hang up the phone.

795
00:53:06,933 --> 00:53:09,902
-Hang up the phone.
-I hope I'll have something...

796
00:53:10,103 --> 00:53:12,435
...a little more exciting next Friday.

797
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:14,570
-You too.
-Hang up.

798
00:53:15,175 --> 00:53:17,609
I'll call you next Friday, Mrs. Evers.

799
00:53:18,545 --> 00:53:20,479
Thank you. Goodbye.

800
00:53:20,947 --> 00:53:22,107
What is going on?

801
00:53:22,349 --> 00:53:25,785
Would a confession by Mr. Beckwith
qualify as exciting?

802
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:27,450
What do you got?

803
00:53:28,221 --> 00:53:29,245
You know Jack Ables?

804
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:30,286
The lawyer?

805
00:53:30,490 --> 00:53:33,948
He's representing a movie studio
in a defamation of character suit...

806
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:38,654
...brought by a couple Klansmen.
While he was doing his research...

807
00:53:38,865 --> 00:53:40,526
...he came across that.

808
00:53:42,035 --> 00:53:43,502
"Klandestine."

809
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:45,597
It was written 20 years ago...

810
00:53:45,805 --> 00:53:49,502
...about this Klan titan turned
FBl informant, Delmar Dennis.

811
00:53:49,709 --> 00:53:54,646
On page 38, he talks about attending
a Klan rally in August of 1965.

812
00:53:54,981 --> 00:53:57,142
Guess who was a motivational speaker?

813
00:53:59,452 --> 00:54:00,942
-Beckwith?
-Our boy.

814
00:54:01,154 --> 00:54:02,382
Listen to this.

815
00:54:02,789 --> 00:54:04,256
And I quote:

816
00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:08,492
" Killing that nigger gave me no more
discomfort than our wives endure...

817
00:54:08,695 --> 00:54:10,686
...when they give birth
to our children."

818
00:54:11,097 --> 00:54:12,860
Sounds like a confession to me.

819
00:54:13,066 --> 00:54:17,332
Let's run down this Delmar Dennis.
We need to have a chat with him.

820
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:28,106
$100 says old Delmar
chickens out on us.

821
00:54:28,415 --> 00:54:31,851
He's probably hiding in the woods,
shitting in his drawers.

822
00:54:40,327 --> 00:54:42,227
Where the hell is this place?

823
00:54:42,462 --> 00:54:44,327
This guy informed on the Klan.

824
00:54:44,564 --> 00:54:49,126
He could have made a deal with them
to save his butt by delivering us.

825
00:54:49,336 --> 00:54:51,099
That's a happy thought.

826
00:55:57,470 --> 00:55:59,438
One of you Bobby DeLaughter?

827
00:56:01,341 --> 00:56:04,572
Holding rallies and burning
crosses is one thing...

828
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:08,077
...but when they killed them
three kids up in Neshoba County...

829
00:56:08,281 --> 00:56:10,579
-...freedom riders--
-Goodman, Chaney, Schwerner?

830
00:56:12,285 --> 00:56:15,015
That made a lot of people
come to their senses.

831
00:56:15,422 --> 00:56:19,051
That's why I decided
to go undercover for the FBl.

832
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:23,092
I need to ask you if what
you say in that book happened.

833
00:56:23,296 --> 00:56:27,392
That part about Beckwith's speech
at that Klan rally. Is that a fact?

834
00:56:28,268 --> 00:56:29,462
It's a fact.

835
00:56:29,836 --> 00:56:33,101
I was shocked, and I remember
thinking how stupid he was...

836
00:56:33,306 --> 00:56:36,298
...shooting off his mouth
like that in front of 100 men.

837
00:56:36,543 --> 00:56:39,444
-Did you report that to the FBl?
-Sure, I did.

838
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:42,876
But Beckwith was a white man
accused of killing a black.

839
00:56:43,083 --> 00:56:46,746
The FBl wasn't gonna blow my cover
on a case they couldn't win.

840
00:56:46,953 --> 00:56:48,944
They were saving me
for Neshoba because--

841
00:56:49,355 --> 00:56:50,913
Two of the victims were white.

842
00:56:58,164 --> 00:57:01,292
Mr. Dennis,
if I can't build the case...

843
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:05,232
...I give you my word that
we never had this conversation.

844
00:57:06,239 --> 00:57:07,672
But if I can...

845
00:57:07,874 --> 00:57:09,432
...will you testify?

846
00:57:13,279 --> 00:57:15,543
Byron De La Beckwith
is the craziest...

847
00:57:15,748 --> 00:57:18,876
...most dangerous son of a bitch
I ever come across.

848
00:57:19,185 --> 00:57:21,779
He's so crazy even
the Klan's afraid of him.

849
00:57:22,021 --> 00:57:23,318
He's an old man now.

850
00:57:23,523 --> 00:57:27,960
That old man is probably more dangerous
today than he was 30 years ago.

851
00:57:28,928 --> 00:57:31,488
Mr. Dennis, we need your help.

852
00:57:32,432 --> 00:57:34,662
I can't make no promises.

853
00:57:38,805 --> 00:57:40,705
You know something, Mr. Dennis?

854
00:57:41,141 --> 00:57:42,665
Six months I've worked this case.

855
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:45,436
A lot of people have told me
to give it up.

856
00:57:45,645 --> 00:57:48,910
" It's 27 years old.
Let sleeping dogs lie."

857
00:57:49,115 --> 00:57:51,549
But I don't see
what difference it makes...

858
00:57:51,751 --> 00:57:53,912
...if a man was
bushwhacked yesterday...

859
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:57,021
...today or 27 damn years ago.

860
00:57:57,223 --> 00:57:58,884
Murder is murder.

861
00:57:59,626 --> 00:58:02,993
It's still my job to bring
the son of a bitch to justice.

862
00:58:03,196 --> 00:58:04,993
It's still your job to help me.

863
00:58:05,231 --> 00:58:08,598
No. I did my job.
I testified against the Klan.

864
00:58:08,801 --> 00:58:11,201
They shot out my windows,
blew up my car.

865
00:58:11,404 --> 00:58:14,168
They hunted and harassed me
for 25 years!

866
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:16,701
Don't that get me even
for the wrong I done?

867
00:58:17,977 --> 00:58:20,639
We never get even
for the wrong we've done.

868
00:58:34,394 --> 00:58:36,294
If I do this thing...

869
00:58:38,731 --> 00:58:40,756
...you gotta promise me protection.

870
00:58:50,643 --> 00:58:51,837
What's going on?

871
00:58:53,079 --> 00:58:53,909
Stop that.

872
00:58:54,113 --> 00:58:55,478
Stop that. IKnock it off.

873
00:58:55,715 --> 00:58:56,545
Enough of that!

874
00:58:56,849 --> 00:58:59,317
-What's going on?
-Eddy called you a nigger lover.

875
00:58:59,519 --> 00:59:02,886
My dad says you're after a man
for something that isn't even a crime.

876
00:59:03,122 --> 00:59:06,455
That's enough fighting, son.
You get on home. Go on home.

877
00:59:06,659 --> 00:59:08,092
Let me take a look at you.

878
00:59:08,294 --> 00:59:11,991
My God. Get in this house.
What's gotten into you?

879
00:59:16,569 --> 00:59:19,197
All this fighting.
All this name-calling.

880
00:59:19,706 --> 00:59:21,003
Is this what you want?

881
00:59:21,241 --> 00:59:22,936
To drag your children into this?

882
00:59:23,176 --> 00:59:26,270
What would you have me do?
Let a murderer go free?

883
00:59:26,646 --> 00:59:29,877
I'd never tell you your business.
I'm thinking about the children.

884
00:59:30,083 --> 00:59:33,382
I don't understand why every
decent person in this state...

885
00:59:33,586 --> 00:59:36,783
...isn't sickened by what
happened here 27 years ago.

886
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:39,254
-Oh, Bobby.
-You're not, are you?

887
00:59:39,459 --> 00:59:41,859
-Not in front of the children.
-Why not?

888
00:59:42,095 --> 00:59:43,528
I was just a kid...

889
00:59:43,730 --> 00:59:46,824
...and I still remember you
and your friends discussing it.

890
00:59:47,033 --> 00:59:50,525
And I recollect someone saying,
"That nigger needed to be shot."

891
00:59:51,804 --> 00:59:53,965
I never said a hateful
thing like that.

892
00:59:54,173 --> 00:59:57,904
-You didn't cry, did you?
-I can't say that I shed any tears--

893
00:59:58,111 --> 01:00:01,672
Had it been our beloved governor,
Ross Barnett, got himself shot...

894
01:00:01,881 --> 01:00:04,611
...you would've been
bawling your eyes out.

895
01:00:04,817 --> 01:00:09,015
Evers left a young widow and three
little kids. Why didn't you cry?

896
01:00:09,222 --> 01:00:11,349
-I don't wanna discuss this now.
-Why?

897
01:00:11,557 --> 01:00:14,048
Because he tried to destroy
our way of life.

898
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:15,955
And he succeeded all too well.

899
01:00:16,162 --> 01:00:18,926
This state's going to hell
on account of integration.

900
01:00:19,132 --> 01:00:21,930
That's a fact. If you think
they appreciate one thing...

901
01:00:22,135 --> 01:00:23,932
...we gave them, you're crazy.

902
01:00:24,137 --> 01:00:26,628
-Tiger, how do you feel?
-I'm all right.

903
01:00:26,839 --> 01:00:30,331
-Your son has one tough nose.
-So it's not broken?

904
01:00:31,611 --> 01:00:34,705
It'll be tender for a couple days,
then it'll be good as new.

905
01:00:34,981 --> 01:00:36,676
Thank you. I appreciate it.

906
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:38,282
You're welcome.

907
01:00:39,018 --> 01:00:40,417
Thank you, ma'am.

908
01:00:46,192 --> 01:00:48,592
Are you the one involved
in this Medgar Evers thing?

909
01:00:50,797 --> 01:00:52,230
Yes, I am.

910
01:00:52,765 --> 01:00:56,257
I think what you're trying to do
is very important.

911
01:01:00,373 --> 01:01:02,238
Thank you very much.

912
01:01:17,857 --> 01:01:20,382
I don't want you kids getting
into anymore fights.

913
01:01:20,593 --> 01:01:23,562
-But he called you a--
-I don't care what he called me.

914
01:01:23,763 --> 01:01:27,426
It doesn't bother me. You gotta
learn not to let it bother you.

915
01:01:27,633 --> 01:01:30,796
A lot of people around here
don't like what Daddy's doing now.

916
01:01:31,137 --> 01:01:32,764
What are you doing, Daddy?

917
01:01:34,307 --> 01:01:37,470
I'm trying to put a bad man in jail.

918
01:01:38,044 --> 01:01:39,978
Mama says what you're doing is wrong.

919
01:01:40,179 --> 01:01:43,444
Grandma said Edgar Mevers
is ruining our life.

920
01:01:48,354 --> 01:01:52,120
Medgar Evers was a good guy
who tried to help people.

921
01:01:52,325 --> 01:01:54,885
Did he try to beat the bad guys?

922
01:01:55,094 --> 01:01:58,723
Yes, he did. He fought
so that black people...

923
01:01:58,931 --> 01:02:01,957
...could eat in the same restaurants,
swim in the same pools...

924
01:02:02,168 --> 01:02:05,899
...shop in the same stores and go
to the same schools as white people.

925
01:02:06,105 --> 01:02:07,129
What's wrong with that?

926
01:02:07,340 --> 01:02:08,432
Nothing.

927
01:02:09,575 --> 01:02:12,305
But you'll hear people say
all kinds of bad things...

928
01:02:12,512 --> 01:02:14,173
...about what your daddy's doing.

929
01:02:14,380 --> 01:02:17,315
They're gonna tease you,
try to pick fights.

930
01:02:17,683 --> 01:02:19,446
But no matter what they do...

931
01:02:20,019 --> 01:02:22,180
...I want you to walk away.

932
01:02:23,222 --> 01:02:25,281
What if they say
something really mean?

933
01:02:25,491 --> 01:02:29,086
They're only words. They can't
hurt you unless you let them.

934
01:02:29,295 --> 01:02:31,763
Is this about sticks and stones?

935
01:02:31,964 --> 01:02:34,626
That's exactly what this is about.

936
01:02:34,934 --> 01:02:36,663
Y'all understand what I'm saying?

937
01:02:36,869 --> 01:02:37,961
Yes, sir.

938
01:02:38,304 --> 01:02:39,464
All right.

939
01:02:39,772 --> 01:02:41,171
All y'all get on to bed now.

940
01:02:42,675 --> 01:02:43,869
Good night.

941
01:03:05,998 --> 01:03:09,525
I heard you had a little visit
with my friend Delmar.

942
01:03:09,735 --> 01:03:10,793
Mr. Beckwith?

943
01:03:11,170 --> 01:03:14,731
Next time you see old Delmar,
you tell him for me...

944
01:03:15,007 --> 01:03:17,032
...there are a lot
of dark, winding roads...

945
01:03:17,243 --> 01:03:21,839
... between the backwoods of Louisiana
and a courtroom in Mississippi.

946
01:03:22,415 --> 01:03:25,009
A man could get lost.

947
01:03:34,794 --> 01:03:36,421
Claire, what's the matter?

948
01:03:36,963 --> 01:03:39,056
The ghost's in my room again.

949
01:03:42,935 --> 01:03:44,926
Let's see what we can do.

950
01:03:47,874 --> 01:03:50,104
-Where is he?
-Sitting right there.

951
01:03:50,309 --> 01:03:51,833
Oh, right.

952
01:03:53,546 --> 01:03:55,605
Daddy, sing "Dixie."

953
01:03:57,617 --> 01:03:59,380
Hop into bed, sweetie.

954
01:04:09,929 --> 01:04:11,021
Sing.

955
01:04:12,565 --> 01:04:16,194
You know, sweetie, maybe
" Dixie" is not the right song.

956
01:04:16,669 --> 01:04:19,035
Maybe that's why
this ghost keeps coming back.

957
01:04:19,238 --> 01:04:21,229
-But you said--
-I know, baby.

958
01:04:21,908 --> 01:04:25,275
But I'm not so sure
that all ghosts like "Dixie."

959
01:04:25,478 --> 01:04:28,242
But how do we know
what this ghost likes?

960
01:04:28,814 --> 01:04:33,274
Seeing as this is your special ghost,
maybe he'll like your favorite song.

961
01:04:33,486 --> 01:04:35,078
"Old MacDonald"?

962
01:04:35,288 --> 01:04:36,915
Let's give it a try.

963
01:04:38,925 --> 01:04:40,916
Old MacDonald had a farm

964
01:04:41,193 --> 01:04:42,751
E-I-E-I-O

965
01:04:42,962 --> 01:04:44,896
And on that farm he had a--

966
01:04:45,097 --> 01:04:45,995
What?

967
01:04:46,499 --> 01:04:47,659
A ghost?

968
01:04:49,669 --> 01:04:51,899
And on that farm he had a ghost

969
01:04:52,104 --> 01:04:53,594
E-I-E-I-O

970
01:04:53,940 --> 01:04:55,908
With a boo boo here
And a boo boo there

971
01:04:56,108 --> 01:04:58,736
Here a boo, there a boo
Everywhere a boo boo

972
01:05:12,558 --> 01:05:14,082
You wanted to have lunch
to talk about Burt's nose?

973
01:05:14,860 --> 01:05:16,088
No, actually, l....

974
01:05:16,295 --> 01:05:17,785
I didn't think so.

975
01:05:20,366 --> 01:05:22,197
So then, this is a date?

976
01:05:23,636 --> 01:05:24,762
Apparently.

977
01:05:25,204 --> 01:05:27,001
In the hospital cafeteria?

978
01:05:27,206 --> 01:05:31,643
I took a chance. I thought
it would either be stupid or charming.

979
01:05:32,345 --> 01:05:33,312
What do you think?

980
01:05:33,746 --> 01:05:35,338
Is there a third choice?

981
01:05:35,548 --> 01:05:36,480
Extremely charming?

982
01:05:36,682 --> 01:05:38,206
That's the one.

983
01:05:40,486 --> 01:05:42,215
How'd you get into all this?

984
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:44,646
You want the standard answer
or the truth?

985
01:05:44,857 --> 01:05:46,381
How about a little of both?

986
01:05:48,394 --> 01:05:50,487
I always liked helping people...

987
01:05:50,696 --> 01:05:51,856
...and I like the hours.

988
01:05:52,131 --> 01:05:53,462
Which answer was that?

989
01:05:53,666 --> 01:05:55,031
A little of both.

990
01:05:55,267 --> 01:05:58,828
But I do like that I work
one week on and one week off.

991
01:05:59,205 --> 01:06:00,365
Can't beat that.

992
01:06:00,573 --> 01:06:03,770
Have to be careful not to shop
too much in that week off.

993
01:06:03,976 --> 01:06:06,570
That can kill you.
What about you?

994
01:06:07,246 --> 01:06:10,044
I wanted to be a lawyer
since I was a little kid.

995
01:06:10,249 --> 01:06:11,876
I watched Perry Mason...

996
01:06:12,084 --> 01:06:15,019
...all the time.
I identified with him.

997
01:06:15,254 --> 01:06:17,722
-But he was a defense attorney.
-I know.

998
01:06:18,190 --> 01:06:21,057
Later, I realized the only way
he ever won a case...

999
01:06:21,260 --> 01:06:23,854
...is if some guy jumped up
and yelled, "I did it!"

1000
01:06:24,063 --> 01:06:27,260
That didn't happen often,
so I switched to the other side.

1001
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:29,932
I think it's a good thing you did.

1002
01:06:32,538 --> 01:06:34,972
You would be in
the minority these days.

1003
01:06:36,242 --> 01:06:39,439
There are a lot more people
on your side than you think.

1004
01:06:40,546 --> 01:06:43,606
You're not saying that because
I bought you a lime Jell-O?

1005
01:06:44,850 --> 01:06:47,284
Well, it is the way
to a woman's heart.

1006
01:06:49,889 --> 01:06:54,326
But if you could pull this off,
it'd do Mississippi a whole lot of good.

1007
01:06:56,062 --> 01:06:57,290
And if I don't?

1008
01:06:58,898 --> 01:07:01,059
I'll pretend I never met you.

1009
01:07:08,574 --> 01:07:11,509
I have renewed faith
in the institution of marriage.

1010
01:07:11,711 --> 01:07:14,077
I can't get enough
of my hunk of burning love.

1011
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:16,248
Not now, Clara May!

1012
01:07:18,918 --> 01:07:20,408
Clara Mayfield.

1013
01:07:21,821 --> 01:07:24,415
-It's Jerry Mitchell.
-I'll take it.

1014
01:07:30,496 --> 01:07:33,056
-I know you have the gun.
-We've been over this.

1015
01:07:33,265 --> 01:07:35,563
I know you found it
in Russel Moore's den.

1016
01:07:36,435 --> 01:07:40,895
There'll be a story about how the
D.A. Iied to the people of Jackson...

1017
01:07:41,107 --> 01:07:43,803
...and how Bobby DeLaughter
lied to Myrlie Evers.

1018
01:07:44,009 --> 01:07:46,534
I'm calling to see
if you care to comment.

1019
01:07:46,746 --> 01:07:48,577
You've explained why
you lied to the press.

1020
01:07:48,781 --> 01:07:51,306
You still have not explained
why you lied to me.

1021
01:07:51,517 --> 01:07:54,077
I told you. Jerry Mitchell
is a loose cannon.

1022
01:07:54,286 --> 01:07:57,255
This case was so delicate,
I didn't want to take chances.

1023
01:07:57,456 --> 01:08:01,449
I'm the last person on earth who
would jeopardize this investigation.

1024
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:04,094
There's something
you're not telling me.

1025
01:08:04,296 --> 01:08:07,163
I swear to God, there is no cover-up.

1026
01:08:07,366 --> 01:08:10,426
You fully intend to seek
an indictment and a new trial?

1027
01:08:10,636 --> 01:08:12,831
That's what we've
been working toward.

1028
01:08:13,038 --> 01:08:15,131
I thought so, Mr. DeLaughter.

1029
01:08:15,541 --> 01:08:16,974
I thought so.

1030
01:08:17,276 --> 01:08:20,837
This latest revelation only proves
what we've suspected all along.

1031
01:08:21,046 --> 01:08:25,107
Peters and DeLaughter are just putting
on a show for the black community.

1032
01:08:25,317 --> 01:08:29,344
As far as I'm concerned, they're nothing
but a pair of lying racists...

1033
01:08:29,555 --> 01:08:31,182
...who never, I repeat, never...

1034
01:08:31,390 --> 01:08:34,359
...had any intention
of prosecuting this case.

1035
01:08:36,395 --> 01:08:37,555
You wanted to see me?

1036
01:08:37,763 --> 01:08:39,663
Come on, sit down.

1037
01:08:42,501 --> 01:08:46,562
You don't mind being seen in
the same room with a "lying racist"?

1038
01:08:47,373 --> 01:08:49,170
I don't mind if you don't.

1039
01:08:50,843 --> 01:08:52,208
You know Pat Bennett?

1040
01:08:52,745 --> 01:08:55,680
Sure, she's one of the best
lawyers in the state.

1041
01:08:57,183 --> 01:08:58,707
Why are we talking about her?

1042
01:09:00,019 --> 01:09:03,182
I thought she might be able
to help you on the case.

1043
01:09:04,089 --> 01:09:06,353
I've got it under control, Ed.

1044
01:09:08,761 --> 01:09:11,389
You have your share of
the 93 capital murder cases...

1045
01:09:11,597 --> 01:09:13,929
...we have waiting for trial
under control?

1046
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:16,998
What new excuse would
you suggest I give...

1047
01:09:17,203 --> 01:09:20,502
...to the families as to why those
who've murdered their loved ones...

1048
01:09:20,706 --> 01:09:22,435
...have yet to see a courtroom?

1049
01:09:23,108 --> 01:09:26,703
I'm just curious.
The fact that Pat Bennett is black...

1050
01:09:26,912 --> 01:09:29,574
...wouldn't have anything to do
with this, would it?

1051
01:09:30,316 --> 01:09:32,477
I'm not gonna dignify that.

1052
01:09:34,486 --> 01:09:37,978
Whatever you may think,
this is not the Bobby DeLaughter case.

1053
01:09:38,190 --> 01:09:41,626
This is a case against the peace
and dignity of Mississippi.

1054
01:09:42,561 --> 01:09:44,995
Monday morning, I'm making a change.

1055
01:09:50,102 --> 01:09:53,503
You're about to hear the testimony
of a fingerprint expert...

1056
01:09:53,706 --> 01:09:58,006
...concerning evidence he claims
to have identified in a certain glass.

1057
01:09:58,210 --> 01:09:59,871
You're entitled to consider...

1058
01:10:00,079 --> 01:10:03,913
... the prosecution's failure to make
the glass available to the defense.

1059
01:10:04,116 --> 01:10:08,644
It is permissible that for one fact
alone to raise a doubt in your minds...

1060
01:10:08,854 --> 01:10:11,254
... that will require
Mrs. Savage's acquittal.

1061
01:10:11,457 --> 01:10:14,790
-Can he do that?
-This is my case, damn it.

1062
01:10:14,994 --> 01:10:17,019
How dare they say
I'm putting on a show?

1063
01:10:17,229 --> 01:10:20,596
Only two people care about
this case, and I'm one of them.

1064
01:10:20,799 --> 01:10:24,565
If anybody's putting on a show,
they are. The only thing they' re--

1065
01:10:25,237 --> 01:10:28,764
They're only trying to stir up
emotions and position themselves...

1066
01:10:28,974 --> 01:10:31,408
...as the saviors
of the black community.

1067
01:10:39,518 --> 01:10:40,678
Where you going?

1068
01:10:59,872 --> 01:11:02,670
This is Bobby DeLaughter.
I hope I didn't disturb you.

1069
01:11:04,343 --> 01:11:06,436
This won't take but a minute, ma'am.

1070
01:11:07,846 --> 01:11:10,076
When I started off,
I had nothing more than...

1071
01:11:10,282 --> 01:11:13,274
...a couple of pages
in an old police report.

1072
01:11:14,053 --> 01:11:17,216
I spent the better part of a year
bumping up against dead witnesses...

1073
01:11:17,423 --> 01:11:19,414
...and tracking down live ones.

1074
01:11:19,625 --> 01:11:22,958
My car's been vandalized,
my son's been in a fight...

1075
01:11:23,162 --> 01:11:26,757
...and I've been called ugly things
by every racist in Mississippi.

1076
01:11:26,966 --> 01:11:29,059
Now, when there's a chance
for an indictment...

1077
01:11:29,268 --> 01:11:31,429
...I've gotta fight off
black politicians too.

1078
01:11:31,637 --> 01:11:35,767
I'm sorry I lied about the gun,
but I've made a commitment to this case.

1079
01:11:35,975 --> 01:11:37,169
I'll be goddamned--

1080
01:11:37,376 --> 01:11:40,209
Pardon me, if I give it up
to some special prosecutor...

1081
01:11:40,412 --> 01:11:42,812
...I don't care if he's
black, green or blue.

1082
01:11:43,015 --> 01:11:46,075
I'm committed and I'm asking you
to make a commitment to me.

1083
01:11:46,285 --> 01:11:49,015
If you do, I'll ride this thing
to the finish line...

1084
01:11:49,221 --> 01:11:51,485
...or collapse
heading in that direction.

1085
01:11:53,058 --> 01:11:55,686
Thank you for your call,
Mr. DeLaughter.

1086
01:12:00,132 --> 01:12:02,532
The hell with her!
She's like all the rest.

1087
01:12:02,735 --> 01:12:06,865
The white world hasn't gone out
of its way to make her trusting.

1088
01:12:07,072 --> 01:12:08,937
When does it start?
What do I have to do?

1089
01:12:09,141 --> 01:12:12,133
We had a real chance to send
a message to this country...

1090
01:12:12,344 --> 01:12:15,313
...that Mississippi isn't
a bunch of redneck racists.

1091
01:12:15,514 --> 01:12:19,610
My mother was right. We should
separate and let the South rise again.

1092
01:12:19,818 --> 01:12:21,945
-You don't believe that.
-Why not?

1093
01:12:22,154 --> 01:12:23,644
She doesn't want my help.

1094
01:12:23,856 --> 01:12:26,290
I'm just another white man
putting her in her place.

1095
01:12:26,492 --> 01:12:28,983
She sees no difference
between me and Beckwith.

1096
01:12:29,194 --> 01:12:31,094
-You didn't tell her about the gun.
-Right.

1097
01:12:31,363 --> 01:12:35,390
If I had it to do over again,
I still wouldn't have told her.

1098
01:12:35,601 --> 01:12:39,560
IKeeping the discovery of the murder
weapon a secret was a good strategy.

1099
01:12:39,772 --> 01:12:43,902
It wouldn't bother her a lick if I was
black. I'd just be a smart lawyer.

1100
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:46,738
You can't have it both ways.

1101
01:12:47,079 --> 01:12:48,808
What do you mean by that?

1102
01:12:50,382 --> 01:12:53,078
You said the reason you didn't
tell her about the gun...

1103
01:12:53,285 --> 01:12:55,913
...was that you were afraid
she would leak the story.

1104
01:12:56,121 --> 01:12:59,215
You can't expect her to trust you,
if you don't trust her.

1105
01:13:17,409 --> 01:13:20,640
I want you to meet with Pat Bennett
and bring her up to speed.

1106
01:13:22,448 --> 01:13:23,472
Fine.

1107
01:13:24,817 --> 01:13:26,250
It's for the best.

1108
01:13:27,386 --> 01:13:28,978
If you say so.

1109
01:13:51,977 --> 01:13:53,968
I'm going out.
You want something?

1110
01:13:54,179 --> 01:13:57,910
I'd like a Mercedes convertible,
but I'd settle for a Dr. Pepper.

1111
01:14:53,438 --> 01:14:56,839
There are four important
things in my life:

1112
01:14:57,743 --> 01:14:59,870
Medgar, Walter...

1113
01:15:00,179 --> 01:15:01,544
...my children...

1114
01:15:01,847 --> 01:15:03,246
...and this...

1115
01:15:03,882 --> 01:15:07,181
...the original
court-certified transcript.

1116
01:15:07,753 --> 01:15:10,313
I've kept this for 27 years...

1117
01:15:10,622 --> 01:15:12,886
...through three district attorneys.

1118
01:15:13,091 --> 01:15:14,991
Once I give this up...

1119
01:15:15,194 --> 01:15:18,061
...I know that it may be gone forever.

1120
01:15:27,706 --> 01:15:30,266
I don't believe you'll find
anymore opposition...

1121
01:15:30,475 --> 01:15:32,966
...to your continuing
to handle this case.

1122
01:15:34,279 --> 01:15:35,541
Thank you, ma'am.

1123
01:15:38,450 --> 01:15:40,543
It's truly appreciated.

1124
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:43,784
Let's get the son of a bitch.

1125
01:15:45,057 --> 01:15:46,456
My pleasure.

1126
01:15:48,594 --> 01:15:50,687
The decision by the D.A.'s office...

1127
01:15:50,896 --> 01:15:54,855
...to re-open the 27-year-old murder
case of Byron De La Beckwith...

1128
01:15:55,067 --> 01:15:56,728
...continues to cause controversy.

1129
01:15:57,069 --> 01:16:00,004
Citizens of Jackson are concerned...

1130
01:16:00,205 --> 01:16:03,504
... that taxpayers' money is being
used to dig up the past.

1131
01:16:03,709 --> 01:16:07,440
The grand jury handed down an
indictment of Byron De La Beckwith...

1132
01:16:07,646 --> 01:16:10,638
...in the murder of
civil rights leader Medgar Evers.

1133
01:16:10,849 --> 01:16:12,373
Extradition in the Beckwith case...

1134
01:16:12,584 --> 01:16:15,815
...is seen as a stumbling
block for the D.A.'s office.

1135
01:16:16,021 --> 01:16:18,387
I plan to fight repossession--
What's the word?

1136
01:16:18,590 --> 01:16:21,753
Extradition tooth, nail and claw!

1137
01:16:22,294 --> 01:16:25,286
In an attempt to replace
a lost autopsy report...

1138
01:16:25,497 --> 01:16:29,263
... the D.A.'s office of Hinds County
today received permission...

1139
01:16:29,468 --> 01:16:31,561
...by the Evers family
to exhume the body...

1140
01:16:31,770 --> 01:16:35,206
...of slain civil rights leader
Medgar Evers.

1141
01:16:35,874 --> 01:16:39,401
The body, buried in
Arlington National Cemetery in 1963...

1142
01:16:39,611 --> 01:16:42,273
... was found in remarkably
near-perfect condition.

1143
01:16:46,385 --> 01:16:49,411
After 18 months, extradition was
finally granted...

1144
01:16:49,621 --> 01:16:51,589
...in the case
of Byron De La Beckwith...

1145
01:16:51,790 --> 01:16:55,658
... the man accused of slaying
civil rights leader Medgar Evers.

1146
01:16:56,728 --> 01:17:01,256
Beckwith will face murder charges
30 years after the initial two trials...

1147
01:17:01,466 --> 01:17:04,594
...for the same offense
ended in hung juries.

1148
01:17:04,803 --> 01:17:05,667
Thank you, son.

1149
01:17:05,971 --> 01:17:07,666
" I first received the call...

1150
01:17:07,873 --> 01:17:09,807
...at 9 :42 p. m...

1151
01:17:10,008 --> 01:17:13,705
...on the night of June 12, 1963.

1152
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:18,108
My partner and I responded
and proceeded to the crime scene...

1153
01:17:18,317 --> 01:17:21,650
...Iocated at 2332 Guynes Street."

1154
01:17:21,987 --> 01:17:23,648
That's pretty good, Benny...

1155
01:17:23,855 --> 01:17:26,790
...but just because you read
the part of a dead witness...

1156
01:17:26,992 --> 01:17:29,893
...doesn't mean you have to
act like you're actually dead.

1157
01:17:30,095 --> 01:17:31,494
I'm doing my best.

1158
01:17:31,697 --> 01:17:33,164
I know you are.

1159
01:17:33,365 --> 01:17:35,856
Medgar Evers' autopsy report
just came in.

1160
01:17:36,501 --> 01:17:39,834
You're not gonna believe this.
He's still dead.

1161
01:17:40,305 --> 01:17:41,499
Thank you, Clara.

1162
01:17:41,707 --> 01:17:45,165
I got off the phone with Charles Evers.
He won't come to the trial.

1163
01:17:45,377 --> 01:17:46,207
Did he say why?

1164
01:17:46,411 --> 01:17:47,673
He wouldn't say.

1165
01:17:47,879 --> 01:17:50,177
Get me the address
of his radio station.

1166
01:17:50,382 --> 01:17:52,543
They found a bullet fragment
in the body.

1167
01:17:52,751 --> 01:17:55,276
It's consistent with a.30-06 Enfield.

1168
01:17:56,254 --> 01:18:00,190
You'll be sorry. What happened to
that nigger will happen to you.

1169
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:02,390
Another one?

1170
01:18:04,229 --> 01:18:08,256
Closer we get to trial, the more
nutjobs will crawl out of the woodwork.

1171
01:18:09,468 --> 01:18:10,366
You got a gun?

1172
01:18:11,903 --> 01:18:13,530
Here. T ake this.

1173
01:18:14,072 --> 01:18:15,937
No, wait. T ake this.

1174
01:18:17,576 --> 01:18:19,168
T ake this.

1175
01:18:43,502 --> 01:18:46,938
That was Muddy Waters doing
his thing for y'all.

1176
01:18:47,139 --> 01:18:50,131
Now I'll play a little something
that goes way back.

1177
01:18:50,342 --> 01:18:53,311
The great Robert Johnson.

1178
01:18:57,749 --> 01:18:58,807
Mr. Evers?

1179
01:19:02,187 --> 01:19:04,655
-Hi, I'm--
-Bobby DeLaughter.

1180
01:19:06,091 --> 01:19:07,820
Please sit down.

1181
01:19:17,669 --> 01:19:19,000
Robert Johnson.

1182
01:19:19,504 --> 01:19:21,734
IKing of the Delta Blues.

1183
01:19:24,576 --> 01:19:26,908
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

1184
01:19:29,481 --> 01:19:31,608
May your soul rise up to heaven...

1185
01:19:31,817 --> 01:19:34,285
...'fore the devil knows you're dead.

1186
01:19:40,792 --> 01:19:45,491
They say Robert Johnson sold his soul to
the devil to play the guitar like that.

1187
01:19:45,897 --> 01:19:46,795
What do you think?

1188
01:19:46,998 --> 01:19:51,298
If the devil wanted my soul, it'd cost
a lot more than some guitar lessons.

1189
01:19:54,539 --> 01:19:57,030
I believe after this trial's over...

1190
01:19:57,242 --> 01:19:59,676
...Mississippi come through this time.

1191
01:19:59,978 --> 01:20:02,845
That's why I came here
to talk with you, Mr. Evers.

1192
01:20:03,048 --> 01:20:06,916
Would you change your mind and come
to the trial? Your presence...

1193
01:20:07,118 --> 01:20:09,052
...would mean a great deal.

1194
01:20:10,889 --> 01:20:13,289
Let me tell you something.

1195
01:20:14,559 --> 01:20:17,050
Medgar was my baby brother.

1196
01:20:17,696 --> 01:20:20,460
There ain't nothing
I wouldn't do for him.

1197
01:20:21,533 --> 01:20:23,262
When we were little kids...

1198
01:20:23,468 --> 01:20:25,231
...we used to sleep in the same bed.

1199
01:20:25,437 --> 01:20:26,836
And on cold nights...

1200
01:20:27,038 --> 01:20:30,667
...I'd climb in first just so I could
warm up the sheets for him.

1201
01:20:33,245 --> 01:20:36,578
I didn't go to the first two trials.

1202
01:20:37,883 --> 01:20:39,407
Myrlie...

1203
01:20:40,085 --> 01:20:43,486
...a lot of people,
they criticized me for that.

1204
01:20:44,289 --> 01:20:46,917
But I won't go
to no third trial neither...

1205
01:20:47,959 --> 01:20:50,553
...and for the exact same reason.

1206
01:20:50,762 --> 01:20:54,789
I know if I ever got in the same room
with Byron De La Beckwith...

1207
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,434
...as God is my witness...

1208
01:20:57,769 --> 01:21:01,261
...I'd wrap my hands around
his chicken neck and snap it in half.

1209
01:21:01,473 --> 01:21:03,202
And nobody...

1210
01:21:03,408 --> 01:21:05,342
...be able to stop me.

1211
01:21:07,012 --> 01:21:08,639
I wouldn't blame you.

1212
01:21:08,847 --> 01:21:10,075
Nobody hardly ever...

1213
01:21:10,282 --> 01:21:12,682
...remembers Medgar anymore.

1214
01:21:13,652 --> 01:21:15,517
Whites or blacks.

1215
01:21:16,187 --> 01:21:18,519
And that's a goddamn shame.

1216
01:21:19,257 --> 01:21:22,090
Because whatever rights
the black man has now...

1217
01:21:22,294 --> 01:21:25,627
...he's got because of something
called the Civil Rights Movement.

1218
01:21:25,830 --> 01:21:28,958
And for a long time here
in the state of Mississippi...

1219
01:21:29,467 --> 01:21:33,267
...before the television, newspapers,
back before the fancy speeches...

1220
01:21:33,471 --> 01:21:37,464
...my brother, Medgar, was
the Civil Rights Movement.

1221
01:21:43,114 --> 01:21:47,608
I'm sitting here tonight,
talking to my friend and your friend...

1222
01:21:47,819 --> 01:21:50,481
...Assistant District Attorney
Bobby DeLaughter.

1223
01:21:50,689 --> 01:21:53,817
We're talking about my brother,
Medgar Evers...

1224
01:21:54,025 --> 01:21:58,826
...and we're gonna play the blues
for Medgar all night long.

1225
01:22:09,341 --> 01:22:11,502
You and my sister-in-law...

1226
01:22:12,611 --> 01:22:14,545
...you get justice for my brother.

1227
01:22:24,322 --> 01:22:26,517
Devil, if you listening...

1228
01:22:26,758 --> 01:22:29,056
...I won't sell my soul
for no guitar lessons...

1229
01:22:29,260 --> 01:22:31,694
...but I'll sell my soul for that.

1230
01:22:36,334 --> 01:22:38,199
Are you surprised bail
was granted so quickly?

1231
01:22:38,403 --> 01:22:41,201
Mr. Beckwith was being held
as a political prisoner.

1232
01:22:41,406 --> 01:22:44,569
He's not been found guilty.
Why should he be kept in jail?

1233
01:22:45,944 --> 01:22:48,435
Mr. Scott, you're an officer
of the Nationalist Movement, correct?

1234
01:22:48,647 --> 01:22:50,979
Is that where the money came from
to secure his bond?

1235
01:22:51,182 --> 01:22:55,414
Mr. Beckwith has a lot of friends here.
We'll do whatever it takes.

1236
01:22:55,887 --> 01:23:00,119
Suppose he doesn't show for the trial?
Suppose he leaves the country?

1237
01:23:00,325 --> 01:23:02,384
If he runs, we'll find him.

1238
01:23:02,594 --> 01:23:04,323
How long will that take?

1239
01:23:04,529 --> 01:23:07,327
Another five years? Another 10?

1240
01:23:07,532 --> 01:23:11,559
I've already devoted a lifetime to this.
That ought to be enough.

1241
01:23:12,537 --> 01:23:15,062
Yes, ma'am. It sure ought to be.

1242
01:23:20,011 --> 01:23:21,638
I'm sorry, Bobby.

1243
01:23:22,747 --> 01:23:24,738
It's all right, Mrs. Evers.

1244
01:23:24,949 --> 01:23:26,439
It's quite all right.

1245
01:23:53,511 --> 01:23:56,071
-How's Jared doing?
-Fine.

1246
01:23:56,281 --> 01:23:59,546
He and Burt seem like
they've been brothers all their lives.

1247
01:23:59,751 --> 01:24:01,275
They all sleeping?

1248
01:24:02,954 --> 01:24:05,184
And that's what you should be doing.

1249
01:24:06,024 --> 01:24:08,219
I want the opening statement
to be great.

1250
01:24:08,993 --> 01:24:11,393
It was great when you read
it three nights ago.

1251
01:24:11,596 --> 01:24:13,530
Unless you snuck in something about...

1252
01:24:13,732 --> 01:24:15,825
...Beckwith deserving
the Nobel Peace Prize...

1253
01:24:16,034 --> 01:24:18,264
...I'm sure it'll be great
tomorrow morning.

1254
01:24:18,470 --> 01:24:20,995
You see? That's why I look to you.

1255
01:24:21,206 --> 01:24:24,664
Eliminate Nobel Peace Prize reference.

1256
01:24:24,876 --> 01:24:26,343
That's good.

1257
01:24:28,680 --> 01:24:32,946
I left a gift for you in appreciation
for everything you're doing...

1258
01:24:33,151 --> 01:24:35,016
... to ruin civilized society.

1259
01:24:35,220 --> 01:24:38,451
-What the hell is this?
-It's scheduled to go off at 10 p.m.

1260
01:24:38,656 --> 01:24:40,647
You have a nice night.

1261
01:24:45,163 --> 01:24:45,993
It's a bomb.

1262
01:24:51,002 --> 01:24:52,799
Everybody, get up.
Let's go.

1263
01:24:53,004 --> 01:24:54,369
What's going on?

1264
01:24:54,572 --> 01:24:58,474
It's nothing at all. Outside that door.
A little drill is all.

1265
01:24:58,676 --> 01:25:00,268
Head for the front door.

1266
01:25:34,412 --> 01:25:36,573
Is this still the drill?

1267
01:25:49,694 --> 01:25:51,252
Where are we going, Dad?

1268
01:25:51,462 --> 01:25:53,589
Told you we're going
to the Holiday Inn.

1269
01:25:53,798 --> 01:25:56,232
Is that where we're going?
The Holiday Inn?

1270
01:25:56,434 --> 01:25:57,332
That's right.

1271
01:25:57,535 --> 01:26:01,869
We haven't found anything,
but we'll go through it one more time.

1272
01:26:02,073 --> 01:26:03,904
I appreciate that.

1273
01:26:24,162 --> 01:26:28,758
I told them if anything ever happened,
all they had to do was walk away.

1274
01:26:30,935 --> 01:26:34,098
How're they supposed to walk away
from a bomb?

1275
01:26:39,077 --> 01:26:41,011
There wasn't a bomb.

1276
01:26:43,548 --> 01:26:45,015
This time.

1277
01:26:48,553 --> 01:26:51,420
If you want to give this thing up,
I understand.

1278
01:26:51,623 --> 01:26:55,150
No one could fault you. But the world
isn't going to be any safer.

1279
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:58,227
I don't give a shit about the world.
These are my children.

1280
01:26:58,429 --> 01:26:59,760
Yes, they are.

1281
01:26:59,964 --> 01:27:02,455
Someday they'll be able
to tell their children...

1282
01:27:02,667 --> 01:27:05,397
...that their daddy put away
Medgar Evers' killer.

1283
01:27:05,970 --> 01:27:08,905
Medgar Evers was a fool,
and my daddy was right.

1284
01:27:09,107 --> 01:27:11,405
Doesn't matter how many
civil rights laws you pass.

1285
01:27:11,609 --> 01:27:13,907
You'll never legislate
how people think.

1286
01:27:14,112 --> 01:27:16,774
There are always gonna be
a few misguided people.

1287
01:27:16,981 --> 01:27:21,077
I'm not talking about a few people.
I'm talking about everybody, about us.

1288
01:27:21,286 --> 01:27:23,754
Do we have one single
black friend? No.

1289
01:27:23,955 --> 01:27:26,423
We don't have dinner with them
or have them over.

1290
01:27:26,624 --> 01:27:28,251
We don't sit with them in church.

1291
01:27:28,459 --> 01:27:31,257
You think this one trial will
magically change this?

1292
01:27:31,496 --> 01:27:33,157
No, I don't.

1293
01:27:33,631 --> 01:27:35,155
It's a step.

1294
01:27:35,900 --> 01:27:37,925
That's all anyone can do
is take a step.

1295
01:27:38,136 --> 01:27:40,263
Why do I have to take that step?

1296
01:27:40,471 --> 01:27:43,406
So some sick son of a bitch
can murder my wife and kids?

1297
01:27:43,608 --> 01:27:46,270
Excuse me if I'm not interested
in taking that step.

1298
01:27:46,477 --> 01:27:47,671
Where are you going?

1299
01:27:47,879 --> 01:27:49,642
For a drive.

1300
01:30:01,913 --> 01:30:06,282
" I don't know if I'm going to heaven
or hell, but I'm going from Jackson."

1301
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:13,984
We're on record in the matter
of Mississippi v. Byron De La Beckwith.

1302
01:30:14,192 --> 01:30:16,319
Does prosecution have
its opening statement?

1303
01:30:17,829 --> 01:30:18,796
We do, Your Honor.

1304
01:30:25,036 --> 01:30:26,901
Ladies and gentlemen...

1305
01:30:27,105 --> 01:30:29,596
...this is a very simple case.

1306
01:30:31,576 --> 01:30:34,238
It's about a man whose life
was snuffed out...

1307
01:30:34,445 --> 01:30:37,812
...on June the 12th of 1963...

1308
01:30:38,416 --> 01:30:41,146
...by a bullet that tore
through his body.

1309
01:30:41,786 --> 01:30:44,721
A bullet aimed out of prejudice...

1310
01:30:44,922 --> 01:30:46,787
...propelled by hatred...

1311
01:30:46,991 --> 01:30:50,427
...and fired by
a back-shooting coward...

1312
01:30:51,562 --> 01:30:53,257
...from ambush...

1313
01:30:54,398 --> 01:30:55,490
...at night.

1314
01:30:56,033 --> 01:31:00,868
The evidence will overwhelmingly show
that Byron De La Beckwith...

1315
01:31:01,339 --> 01:31:04,775
...a self-proclaimed, rabid racist
on a lifelong mission...

1316
01:31:04,976 --> 01:31:07,774
...to purge society
of anyone and anything...

1317
01:31:07,979 --> 01:31:09,606
...that stood for integration...

1318
01:31:09,814 --> 01:31:12,339
...is the man that fired that bullet.

1319
01:31:12,917 --> 01:31:16,182
Evidence will show how, when he
thought he beat the system...

1320
01:31:16,387 --> 01:31:18,981
...he bragged about what he'd done.

1321
01:31:20,024 --> 01:31:23,391
Bragged about getting
away with murder.

1322
01:31:25,463 --> 01:31:29,593
The evidence will undeniably show that
the person who pulled the trigger...

1323
01:31:29,800 --> 01:31:33,827
...and ended the life of Medgar Evers
is this defendant...

1324
01:31:34,672 --> 01:31:36,731
...Byron De La Beckwith.

1325
01:31:41,245 --> 01:31:42,712
Mr. Coxwell?

1326
01:31:43,748 --> 01:31:45,340
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

1327
01:31:45,783 --> 01:31:49,514
My name is Merrida Coxwell.
This is James Kitchens...

1328
01:31:49,720 --> 01:31:52,951
...and we are representing
Mr. Beckwith.

1329
01:31:53,558 --> 01:31:56,288
Mr. DeLaughter started
his opening statement...

1330
01:31:56,494 --> 01:31:59,463
...by saying that this was
a very simple case.

1331
01:31:59,664 --> 01:32:01,131
I agree with him.

1332
01:32:01,399 --> 01:32:05,392
But what Mr. DeLaughter is going
to rely on is for you...

1333
01:32:05,603 --> 01:32:10,199
...to convict Mr. Beckwith
simply because of his opinions.

1334
01:32:10,808 --> 01:32:11,968
That's because...

1335
01:32:12,176 --> 01:32:16,636
...he knows that the state cannot prove
to you beyond a reasonable doubt...

1336
01:32:16,847 --> 01:32:19,407
...that the defendant committed
the crime.

1337
01:32:19,617 --> 01:32:21,949
By the time this trial is over...

1338
01:32:22,153 --> 01:32:25,816
...you will have seen it was
physically impossible...

1339
01:32:26,023 --> 01:32:29,117
...for Mr. Byron De La Beckwith
to have killed Medgar Evers.

1340
01:32:29,460 --> 01:32:31,860
Mr. Beckwith is not guilty.

1341
01:32:32,063 --> 01:32:34,395
That's what the proof will show.

1342
01:32:34,999 --> 01:32:36,227
Thank you.

1343
01:32:38,135 --> 01:32:40,126
The state may call its first witness.

1344
01:32:41,405 --> 01:32:43,896
The state calls Myrlie Evers.

1345
01:32:56,887 --> 01:32:58,252
Raise your right hand.

1346
01:32:58,456 --> 01:33:00,481
Do you swear to tell the truth...

1347
01:33:00,691 --> 01:33:03,455
-...the whole truth, so help you God?
-I do.

1348
01:33:03,728 --> 01:33:05,025
Be seated.

1349
01:33:11,269 --> 01:33:13,032
Will you tell us your name?

1350
01:33:13,604 --> 01:33:15,697
My name is Myrlie Evers.

1351
01:33:15,906 --> 01:33:19,000
Going back to 1963,
were you married at that time?

1352
01:33:19,210 --> 01:33:20,643
Yes, I was.

1353
01:33:20,845 --> 01:33:22,676
And to whom were you married?

1354
01:33:25,416 --> 01:33:27,281
Medgar Wylie...

1355
01:33:27,485 --> 01:33:28,975
...Evers.

1356
01:33:35,293 --> 01:33:38,285
When was the last time
you saw your husband alive?

1357
01:33:39,163 --> 01:33:41,859
June 11, 1963.

1358
01:33:43,534 --> 01:33:45,593
I'd fallen behind...

1359
01:33:45,803 --> 01:33:48,966
...in my housework
and got up early that morning...

1360
01:33:49,240 --> 01:33:51,731
...to iron some shirts for Medgar.

1361
01:33:53,110 --> 01:33:54,600
By the time he woke...

1362
01:33:54,812 --> 01:33:59,146
...I had 10 freshly ironed shirts
neatly hung on hangers.

1363
01:34:00,685 --> 01:34:03,950
He said, "I thank you
for ironing these shirts...

1364
01:34:04,155 --> 01:34:05,918
...but I'm not going to need them."

1365
01:34:07,358 --> 01:34:11,351
Before he left for work that morning,
he kissed us all goodbye...

1366
01:34:11,762 --> 01:34:13,662
...and then left.

1367
01:34:15,032 --> 01:34:16,624
But then he came back...

1368
01:34:16,834 --> 01:34:18,927
...and took me aside.

1369
01:34:19,337 --> 01:34:21,828
He said, "If anything
should happen to me...

1370
01:34:22,039 --> 01:34:24,098
...I want you to promise me...

1371
01:34:24,308 --> 01:34:27,004
...you will take care of my babies."

1372
01:34:27,945 --> 01:34:31,312
I said, "Of course.
They're my babies too."

1373
01:34:33,751 --> 01:34:37,346
He then kissed us all
goodbye again and left.

1374
01:34:40,358 --> 01:34:42,758
Could you tell the jury
what you remember...

1375
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:46,919
...seeing and hearing when your husband
returned home that night?

1376
01:34:47,598 --> 01:34:51,125
It was just after midnight
when he got home.

1377
01:34:51,969 --> 01:34:53,800
We heard the car.

1378
01:35:02,246 --> 01:35:04,714
And then there was...

1379
01:35:09,053 --> 01:35:11,647
...this horrible blast.

1380
01:35:14,191 --> 01:35:15,818
The children...

1381
01:35:16,527 --> 01:35:19,758
...fell to the floor
as their father had taught them.

1382
01:35:20,765 --> 01:35:23,325
I bolted to the front door.

1383
01:35:24,702 --> 01:35:27,569
Medgar was lying in the carport.

1384
01:35:28,806 --> 01:35:31,331
He still had his keys in his hand.

1385
01:35:33,544 --> 01:35:35,910
Blood everywhere.

1386
01:35:37,648 --> 01:35:40,276
The children came out
shortly after I did...

1387
01:35:40,484 --> 01:35:42,349
...and they were screaming...

1388
01:35:43,354 --> 01:35:44,514
... "Daddy!

1389
01:35:45,556 --> 01:35:47,080
Daddy, get up!

1390
01:35:48,893 --> 01:35:50,861
Daddy, please get up."

1391
01:35:54,465 --> 01:35:57,366
But I knew he would
never get up again.

1392
01:36:02,373 --> 01:36:04,273
Nothing further, Your Honor.

1393
01:36:06,377 --> 01:36:11,440
Mr. McIntyre, have you ever owned
a 1917 Enfield.30-06 rifle?

1394
01:36:12,249 --> 01:36:13,443
Yes, I have.

1395
01:36:13,651 --> 01:36:16,381
Did you own that rifle in 1963?

1396
01:36:17,321 --> 01:36:22,122
Sometime, I believe in 1960,
I traded it to Mr. Beckwith.

1397
01:36:22,393 --> 01:36:26,454
Mr. McIntyre, I want to show you
this firearm and ask if you would...

1398
01:36:26,664 --> 01:36:29,895
...read the serial number
on the barrel, please.

1399
01:36:30,601 --> 01:36:34,537
1-0-5-2-6-8-2.

1400
01:36:34,738 --> 01:36:38,799
Thank you. Going back to exhibit 35,
would you read the serial number...

1401
01:36:39,009 --> 01:36:41,477
...on the invoice of the gun
that you purchased...

1402
01:36:41,679 --> 01:36:43,738
...and later traded to Mr. Beckwith?

1403
01:36:43,948 --> 01:36:47,611
1-0-5-2-6-8-2.

1404
01:36:48,118 --> 01:36:52,487
Ms. Holder, were you at Joe's Drive-In
on the night of June 11, 1963?

1405
01:36:52,690 --> 01:36:53,816
Yes, sir.

1406
01:36:54,024 --> 01:36:57,755
I wasn't working, but I was there
hanging out with my friends.

1407
01:36:58,262 --> 01:37:01,390
T ell the jury if there came
a time when your attention...

1408
01:37:01,599 --> 01:37:04,090
...was directed towards
any particular automobile.

1409
01:37:06,103 --> 01:37:08,833
Being a carhop, you notice cars.

1410
01:37:09,039 --> 01:37:12,202
This one had a long antenna
on the side of it.

1411
01:37:12,409 --> 01:37:14,843
We thought at first
it was a patrol car.

1412
01:37:15,479 --> 01:37:18,448
It was white and it had
a lot of mud on it.

1413
01:37:19,483 --> 01:37:21,280
It was a Plymouth Valiant.

1414
01:37:21,485 --> 01:37:26,252
Mr. Hargrove, were you employed by the
Jackson Police Department in June 1963?

1415
01:37:26,457 --> 01:37:28,186
Yes, I was.

1416
01:37:28,392 --> 01:37:32,123
In charge of the ldentification Division
for 42 years.

1417
01:37:32,329 --> 01:37:35,457
Did you reach a conclusion
as to whose fingerprint...

1418
01:37:35,666 --> 01:37:38,100
...was on the telescopic side
of the gun...

1419
01:37:38,302 --> 01:37:42,568
...recovered in your presence
on June 12, 1963?

1420
01:37:42,907 --> 01:37:44,169
Yes, sir. I did.

1421
01:37:44,375 --> 01:37:47,674
With 14 points of identification,
there's more than enough...

1422
01:37:47,878 --> 01:37:51,211
...to identify the fingerprint
of Mr. Byron De La Beckwith.

1423
01:37:51,515 --> 01:37:55,781
After four days of testimony in the
trial of white supremacist Beckwith...

1424
01:37:55,986 --> 01:37:59,387
...the prosecution, thus far, has
presented essentially the same case...

1425
01:37:59,590 --> 01:38:00,887
...as was offered up
in the two original trials.

1426
01:38:02,826 --> 01:38:05,954
However, this time there are
two significant differences.

1427
01:38:06,163 --> 01:38:08,222
First, the makeup of the jury.

1428
01:38:08,432 --> 01:38:12,562
In 1964, Beckwith faced
two all-male, all-white juries.

1429
01:38:12,770 --> 01:38:16,399
Today, he faces a jury made up
of eight blacks and four whites.

1430
01:38:16,607 --> 01:38:20,737
Tomorrow the prosecution is expected
to introduce three new witnesses...

1431
01:38:20,945 --> 01:38:23,607
... who did not testify
in the first two trials.

1432
01:38:25,783 --> 01:38:27,774
State your name for the record.

1433
01:38:27,985 --> 01:38:29,418
Delmar Dennis.

1434
01:38:29,620 --> 01:38:32,020
Mr. Dennis, in March of 1964...

1435
01:38:32,222 --> 01:38:34,349
...were you a member
of an organization known as...

1436
01:38:34,558 --> 01:38:36,458
...the White Knights
of the Ku Klux Klan?

1437
01:38:36,660 --> 01:38:37,786
I was.

1438
01:38:37,995 --> 01:38:39,519
In September of that year...

1439
01:38:39,730 --> 01:38:42,631
...did you become
a paid informant for the FBl?

1440
01:38:42,833 --> 01:38:44,095
I did.

1441
01:38:44,301 --> 01:38:46,201
And in your capacity as informant...

1442
01:38:46,403 --> 01:38:49,998
...did you ever encounter
the defendant, Byron De La Beckwith?

1443
01:38:50,708 --> 01:38:52,039
I did.

1444
01:38:53,043 --> 01:38:55,477
What were the circumstances
of that encounter?

1445
01:38:56,213 --> 01:38:59,341
On August 8, 1965,
I met Mr. Beckwith...

1446
01:38:59,550 --> 01:39:01,745
...at a Klan meeting
in Byram, Mississippi.

1447
01:39:02,019 --> 01:39:04,044
He was a featured speaker that night.

1448
01:39:04,888 --> 01:39:08,415
Now, during that talk, would you tell
the jury what, if anything...

1449
01:39:08,626 --> 01:39:13,120
...the defendant said about the murder
or shooting death of Medgar Evers.

1450
01:39:14,598 --> 01:39:17,567
He said, "Killing that nigger gave me
no more inner discomfort...

1451
01:39:17,768 --> 01:39:20,862
...than our wives endure
giving birth to our children.

1452
01:39:21,071 --> 01:39:22,971
We gotta kill those enemies...

1453
01:39:23,173 --> 01:39:26,165
...including the President,
from the top down."

1454
01:39:26,677 --> 01:39:28,167
Did he say anything else?

1455
01:39:28,479 --> 01:39:29,605
Yes, sir.

1456
01:39:29,813 --> 01:39:32,907
He said, "You're gonna get away
with it like I did."

1457
01:39:33,984 --> 01:39:35,815
Thank you, Mr. Dennis.

1458
01:39:36,153 --> 01:39:37,051
Your witness.

1459
01:39:41,358 --> 01:39:44,191
You have seen FBl reports
about your activities...

1460
01:39:44,395 --> 01:39:46,386
...as a paid informant, haven't you?

1461
01:39:46,930 --> 01:39:49,364
Mr. DeLaughter's office
furnished me with copies.

1462
01:39:49,566 --> 01:39:50,658
In fact, there are...

1463
01:39:50,868 --> 01:39:53,029
...pages and pages of dialogue...

1464
01:39:53,237 --> 01:39:55,671
...that you reported
to the FBl of things...

1465
01:39:55,939 --> 01:39:58,635
...that various people said
over lunch, over dinner...

1466
01:39:58,842 --> 01:40:02,334
...riding in cars, meetings.
Isn't that right?

1467
01:40:03,714 --> 01:40:06,740
Yet, nowhere in all those reports...

1468
01:40:06,950 --> 01:40:10,852
...does the quotation that you
attributed to Mr. Beckwith appear.

1469
01:40:11,055 --> 01:40:12,352
Does it?

1470
01:40:13,290 --> 01:40:15,690
Maybe the pages got lost
over the years.

1471
01:40:15,893 --> 01:40:17,986
And maybe they never existed.

1472
01:40:18,195 --> 01:40:19,127
Objection.

1473
01:40:19,329 --> 01:40:20,296
Sustained.

1474
01:40:20,731 --> 01:40:22,596
Dog ate my homework.

1475
01:40:23,634 --> 01:40:26,194
Mr. Dennis, did Byron De La Beckwith...

1476
01:40:26,403 --> 01:40:29,930
...ever specifically say
that he killed Medgar Evers?

1477
01:40:31,575 --> 01:40:34,476
He never said, "I killed
Medgar Evers. "That's true.

1478
01:40:34,678 --> 01:40:35,770
No further questions.

1479
01:40:35,979 --> 01:40:37,469
That's what he meant.

1480
01:40:37,681 --> 01:40:41,117
We ask that the witness's unsolicited
opinion be stricken...

1481
01:40:41,385 --> 01:40:43,615
...and that the jury disregard it.

1482
01:40:44,354 --> 01:40:48,120
The jury will disregard
Mr. Dennis' last statement.

1483
01:40:49,259 --> 01:40:53,696
I was standing out in the yard,
and he said something to me about...

1484
01:40:53,897 --> 01:40:57,333
...having been tried twice
in Mississippi...

1485
01:40:57,568 --> 01:40:59,126
...for "killing that nigger."

1486
01:40:59,336 --> 01:41:00,963
And what'd he say about that?

1487
01:41:01,171 --> 01:41:02,297
He said...

1488
01:41:03,240 --> 01:41:05,765
... "I had a job to do and I did it."

1489
01:41:06,143 --> 01:41:08,737
Thank you, Mr. Prince.
Nothing further.

1490
01:41:11,515 --> 01:41:15,451
Back in 1986, when Mr. Beckwith
allegedly made this statement to you...

1491
01:41:15,652 --> 01:41:18,644
...you went straight
to the authorities, didn't you?

1492
01:41:19,823 --> 01:41:22,348
Well, you must've told
some of your buddies.

1493
01:41:23,527 --> 01:41:26,496
You didn't tell anybody you were
renting a house from a man...

1494
01:41:26,697 --> 01:41:29,097
...who admitted to you
that he'd killed somebody?

1495
01:41:29,366 --> 01:41:31,698
I didn't at that time, no.

1496
01:41:32,302 --> 01:41:35,100
Mr. and Mrs. Beckwith had you
thrown out of the house...

1497
01:41:35,305 --> 01:41:37,603
...because you had
a drinking problem, right?

1498
01:41:41,411 --> 01:41:43,879
I had a drinking problem...

1499
01:41:44,548 --> 01:41:46,038
...but that's not why they--

1500
01:41:46,250 --> 01:41:50,050
You don't particularly like Mr. Beckwith
for throwing you out, do you?

1501
01:41:52,089 --> 01:41:53,420
Mrs. Morgan...

1502
01:41:53,624 --> 01:41:57,583
...when you lived in Greenwood,
Mississippi in the early 1970s...

1503
01:41:57,795 --> 01:42:01,731
...did you and your husband give
the defendant a ride to Parchman Prison?

1504
01:42:01,965 --> 01:42:02,897
Yes, sir.

1505
01:42:03,100 --> 01:42:06,536
Me and my husband, Lloyd, was going
to see Lloyd's brother...

1506
01:42:06,737 --> 01:42:08,136
...Jimmy Dale Morgan...

1507
01:42:08,338 --> 01:42:11,967
...and Mr. Beckwith was going to see
some friend of his...

1508
01:42:12,176 --> 01:42:14,337
...whose name he wouldn't tell us.

1509
01:42:14,678 --> 01:42:18,307
During that time, did he make
any statements concerning the murder...

1510
01:42:18,515 --> 01:42:19,982
...of Medgar Evers?

1511
01:42:20,617 --> 01:42:21,481
Yes, sir.

1512
01:42:21,685 --> 01:42:25,781
He said that he had killed
Medgar Evers, a nigger...

1513
01:42:25,989 --> 01:42:30,426
...and said we'd better not say anything
about us driving him up to Parchman...

1514
01:42:30,627 --> 01:42:33,391
...because he wasn't scared
to kill again.

1515
01:42:33,864 --> 01:42:35,058
Thank you, Mrs. Morgan.

1516
01:42:41,805 --> 01:42:44,365
You have had some
very traumatic things...

1517
01:42:44,575 --> 01:42:46,702
...happen to you in your life,
haven't you?

1518
01:42:47,044 --> 01:42:48,443
Most definitely.

1519
01:42:48,645 --> 01:42:50,272
Your estranged husband...

1520
01:42:50,480 --> 01:42:53,108
...Lloyd Morgan, was
very abusive to you.

1521
01:42:53,317 --> 01:42:55,342
Objection. Irrelevant.

1522
01:42:56,119 --> 01:42:58,053
Where are you going with this?

1523
01:42:58,255 --> 01:42:59,620
If you'll allow me...

1524
01:42:59,823 --> 01:43:03,919
...this line of questioning speaks
directly to this witness's credibility.

1525
01:43:04,628 --> 01:43:05,617
Overruled.

1526
01:43:11,001 --> 01:43:13,162
Your husband, you told us...

1527
01:43:13,370 --> 01:43:17,739
...carried on an incestuous
relationship with one of his children.

1528
01:43:18,275 --> 01:43:19,742
Yes, he did.

1529
01:43:19,943 --> 01:43:21,638
And your father...

1530
01:43:21,845 --> 01:43:25,076
...was very abusive to you
when you were a child.

1531
01:43:25,983 --> 01:43:27,280
Yes, sir.

1532
01:43:27,517 --> 01:43:28,779
And as a result...

1533
01:43:29,052 --> 01:43:30,383
...of all this...

1534
01:43:30,621 --> 01:43:33,556
...you have been diagnosed
by psychiatrists...

1535
01:43:33,757 --> 01:43:35,952
...as having an anxiety disorder.

1536
01:43:37,060 --> 01:43:39,051
Yes, sir, I have.

1537
01:43:40,731 --> 01:43:42,665
I have nothing further.

1538
01:43:44,067 --> 01:43:47,833
If this jury wants to believe
a lying drunk, a paid informant...

1539
01:43:48,038 --> 01:43:49,562
...and a damn loony bird...

1540
01:43:49,773 --> 01:43:51,764
...then I might be
in a bit of trouble.

1541
01:43:51,975 --> 01:43:53,465
But not as much trouble
as our beloved justice system.

1542
01:43:55,412 --> 01:43:58,939
And this Prince fella
still owes me $ 64 worth of rent.

1543
01:43:59,149 --> 01:44:01,982
How do you account for
the matching numbers on the gun?

1544
01:44:02,185 --> 01:44:05,643
My rifle was stolen days
before this nigger turned up dead.

1545
01:44:05,856 --> 01:44:07,517
Turn those lights off.

1546
01:44:08,525 --> 01:44:11,517
Mom, how can you stand
watching this idiot?

1547
01:44:11,728 --> 01:44:13,252
When your father died...

1548
01:44:13,463 --> 01:44:15,988
...I carried around
such hatred for that man...

1549
01:44:16,199 --> 01:44:19,464
... I actually made inquiries
into having him killed.

1550
01:44:20,337 --> 01:44:23,431
But in time, I was able
to let that hatred go.

1551
01:44:23,640 --> 01:44:25,073
I don't know how.

1552
01:44:25,275 --> 01:44:28,676
I remembered something
your father once said to me.

1553
01:44:28,879 --> 01:44:32,975
He said, "When you hate,
the only person who suffers is you.

1554
01:44:33,183 --> 01:44:35,048
Because most of the people you hate...

1555
01:44:35,252 --> 01:44:38,346
...don't know it
and the others don't care."

1556
01:44:38,755 --> 01:44:41,656
The big question here is
will Beckwith testify...

1557
01:44:41,858 --> 01:44:45,658
...as he did so confidently
back in 1964?

1558
01:44:48,498 --> 01:44:51,399
Everybody wants to see
the Byron De La Beckwith Show.

1559
01:44:51,601 --> 01:44:53,432
What if putting him on is too risky?

1560
01:44:53,637 --> 01:44:55,332
You kidding? He'll wanna tell
that cock-and-bull story...

1561
01:44:56,907 --> 01:44:59,740
...about his gun being stolen
two days before the murder.

1562
01:44:59,943 --> 01:45:03,845
Besides, this is Byron De La Beckwith
we're talking about.

1563
01:45:04,047 --> 01:45:06,413
Summoned from his mountain
by God Almighty...

1564
01:45:06,616 --> 01:45:09,084
...to give us
the word according to Delay.

1565
01:45:10,187 --> 01:45:11,415
He'll testify.

1566
01:45:11,822 --> 01:45:13,312
I'll see you upstairs.

1567
01:45:31,641 --> 01:45:34,576
Something happen to you in your boyhood
make you mean-spirited...

1568
01:45:34,778 --> 01:45:36,609
...enough to turn on your own?

1569
01:45:36,813 --> 01:45:41,375
Do what the good Lord and Mississippi
got every right to expect you to do.

1570
01:45:42,052 --> 01:45:42,882
Which is?

1571
01:45:43,086 --> 01:45:47,352
Putting niggers away for killing white
people instead of the other way around.

1572
01:45:47,557 --> 01:45:51,926
Mr. Peters and y'all should be run out
of this state for this foolishness...

1573
01:45:52,129 --> 01:45:53,721
...and y'all probably will be.

1574
01:45:54,998 --> 01:45:59,128
This is not some deer you brought down.
This is a human being.

1575
01:45:59,336 --> 01:46:03,204
A deer, Mr. DeLaughter,
is a beautiful animal.

1576
01:46:03,407 --> 01:46:04,965
It's one of God's creatures.

1577
01:46:05,175 --> 01:46:07,973
I would never kill a deer.

1578
01:46:08,111 --> 01:46:11,478
A nigger, on the other hand,
that's another matter entirely.

1579
01:46:11,848 --> 01:46:14,248
Are you standing here
admitting to me that you--

1580
01:46:14,618 --> 01:46:16,347
IKilled Medgar Evers?

1581
01:46:16,553 --> 01:46:18,214
What if I did?

1582
01:46:18,655 --> 01:46:22,147
It's not like there's anything you
nor anybody else can do about it.

1583
01:46:22,359 --> 01:46:23,451
Is there?

1584
01:46:24,327 --> 01:46:25,453
We'll see about that.

1585
01:46:25,662 --> 01:46:27,323
Oh, that we will.

1586
01:46:27,531 --> 01:46:29,158
That we will.

1587
01:46:31,168 --> 01:46:33,932
You know, it only takes
but one of them, doesn't it?

1588
01:46:34,371 --> 01:46:35,998
The question is...

1589
01:46:36,206 --> 01:46:37,503
...which one will it be?

1590
01:46:38,241 --> 01:46:41,074
Maybe that chubby white gal
who'd be sorely vexed...

1591
01:46:41,278 --> 01:46:45,681
...to let one of her own kind be
put away, no matter what she told you.

1592
01:46:46,116 --> 01:46:47,947
Or maybe that old nigger minister...

1593
01:46:48,151 --> 01:46:52,383
...who won't want sending a sick
old man to prison on his conscience.

1594
01:46:52,789 --> 01:46:57,726
You ain't never gonna get 12 people
to convict me of killing a nigger...

1595
01:46:57,961 --> 01:46:59,929
...in the state of Mississippi.

1596
01:47:00,130 --> 01:47:03,258
No, sir. Hell, I don't even have
to take the stand.

1597
01:47:03,467 --> 01:47:07,164
Couple more days, I'll be heading back
to my home in T ennessee...

1598
01:47:07,437 --> 01:47:09,371
...where I will sit on my porch...

1599
01:47:09,573 --> 01:47:13,304
...and live out my days
in peace and prosperity.

1600
01:47:13,977 --> 01:47:15,672
What are you gonna do?

1601
01:47:19,082 --> 01:47:20,777
What are you gonna do?

1602
01:47:21,284 --> 01:47:23,775
" Free at last, free at last.

1603
01:47:23,987 --> 01:47:26,956
Great God Almighty, I'm free at last!"

1604
01:47:30,794 --> 01:47:32,728
The defense calls James Holley.

1605
01:47:35,832 --> 01:47:37,857
Relax. He's just needling you.

1606
01:47:39,269 --> 01:47:39,667
He'll testify.

1607
01:47:42,372 --> 01:47:43,805
Raise your right hand.

1608
01:47:44,007 --> 01:47:48,239
You swear the testimony you'll give
is the whole truth, so help you God?

1609
01:47:48,445 --> 01:47:50,413
-I do.
-Be seated.

1610
01:47:52,749 --> 01:47:57,209
Mr. Holley, did you have a personal
relationship with the defendant?

1611
01:47:57,420 --> 01:48:01,186
No, sir. None whatsoever.
I just kind of knew who he was.

1612
01:48:01,391 --> 01:48:04,485
Mr. Holley, in the early morning
of June 12th, 1963...

1613
01:48:04,694 --> 01:48:07,128
...did you have occasion
to see Mr. Beckwith?

1614
01:48:08,031 --> 01:48:10,295
He was standing outside
at a Shell station...

1615
01:48:10,500 --> 01:48:13,025
...while the attendant was
putting gas in his car.

1616
01:48:13,336 --> 01:48:15,497
T ell the jury what time
you saw him.

1617
01:48:16,173 --> 01:48:18,801
At approximately 1:03 in the morning.

1618
01:48:19,543 --> 01:48:22,842
About how many miles is it
from Greenwood to Jackson?

1619
01:48:23,346 --> 01:48:27,373
Must be around 90, 95 miles.

1620
01:48:27,584 --> 01:48:31,042
So you saw the defendant
less than an hour after the murder...

1621
01:48:31,254 --> 01:48:35,953
...calmly standing by his car some 95
miles away from the scene of the crime?

1622
01:48:38,762 --> 01:48:40,559
I have nothing further.

1623
01:48:45,602 --> 01:48:46,728
Mr. Holley...

1624
01:48:46,937 --> 01:48:49,371
...on the night you say you saw...

1625
01:48:49,606 --> 01:48:52,370
...Byron De La Beckwith
in Greenwood....

1626
01:48:52,776 --> 01:48:55,574
Delay, as you call him, I believe.
Is that right?

1627
01:48:55,779 --> 01:48:57,178
Delay Beckwith, yes, sir.

1628
01:48:57,380 --> 01:49:00,872
Why do you call him Delay?
Are y'all first-name buddies?

1629
01:49:01,084 --> 01:49:04,611
No, sir. I call him Mr. Beckwith
most of the time.

1630
01:49:06,223 --> 01:49:07,247
We just noted...

1631
01:49:07,457 --> 01:49:09,857
... "Delay's car"
and "Delay and the attendant."

1632
01:49:10,060 --> 01:49:13,257
Isn't that exactly what you told
me and my investigators...

1633
01:49:13,463 --> 01:49:16,057
...when we asked what you were
doing that night?

1634
01:49:17,467 --> 01:49:18,798
"Delay."

1635
01:49:19,469 --> 01:49:20,731
Your buddy.

1636
01:49:20,937 --> 01:49:22,461
My friend.

1637
01:49:23,073 --> 01:49:25,473
And how long has he been your friend?

1638
01:49:26,743 --> 01:49:29,644
-Just shortly after World War ll.
-When you said...

1639
01:49:29,846 --> 01:49:34,044
...you had no personal relationship
with him, that wasn't entirely true.

1640
01:49:34,251 --> 01:49:38,153
You've known him a long time and been
friends a long time, right?

1641
01:49:38,355 --> 01:49:40,448
Well, sure, we're friends.

1642
01:49:40,657 --> 01:49:42,818
Just like I hope
you and I are friends.

1643
01:49:45,095 --> 01:49:45,925
Pardon?

1644
01:49:46,162 --> 01:49:49,359
I said just like I would hope
you and I are friends.

1645
01:49:50,700 --> 01:49:52,167
I'm flattered.

1646
01:49:54,738 --> 01:49:56,296
Let me ask you this.

1647
01:49:56,873 --> 01:49:58,966
At the time the defendant
was arrested...

1648
01:49:59,175 --> 01:50:01,837
...there were a whole lot
of law enforcement people...

1649
01:50:02,045 --> 01:50:04,513
...trying to gather
information, am I right?

1650
01:50:04,714 --> 01:50:06,443
FBl, Jackson Police.

1651
01:50:06,650 --> 01:50:08,015
Do you remember that?

1652
01:50:08,551 --> 01:50:09,643
Did you speak to...

1653
01:50:09,853 --> 01:50:12,515
...Detective Sanders,
one of the investigators?

1654
01:50:13,056 --> 01:50:14,853
I might've spoken a word with him.

1655
01:50:15,125 --> 01:50:19,528
Then you told him you saw Beckwith
in Greenwood the night of the killing.

1656
01:50:19,729 --> 01:50:21,162
-ls that right?
-I did not.

1657
01:50:22,565 --> 01:50:23,497
Why not?

1658
01:50:23,833 --> 01:50:25,926
I had no reason to tell
unless he asked.

1659
01:50:26,136 --> 01:50:30,300
You had no reason, as a sworn police
officer, to tell an investigator...

1660
01:50:30,507 --> 01:50:32,031
...in an important murder case...

1661
01:50:32,242 --> 01:50:36,645
...that you knew the suspect was 90
miles away at the time of the murder?

1662
01:50:36,846 --> 01:50:39,474
I'd have been butting
into his investigation--

1663
01:50:39,683 --> 01:50:43,483
You'd have been "butting into his
investigation "by telling him an alibi?

1664
01:50:44,087 --> 01:50:45,315
Sure.

1665
01:50:46,923 --> 01:50:50,086
Did you ever go to the D.A.
and tell them what was going on?

1666
01:50:50,894 --> 01:50:53,328
Did you tell the FBl
what was going on?

1667
01:50:54,230 --> 01:50:58,098
The only person you spoke to
about this case was Hardy Lott...

1668
01:50:58,301 --> 01:50:59,893
...Mr. Beckwith's defense attorney.

1669
01:51:00,103 --> 01:51:02,537
-When he called me--
-How long was...

1670
01:51:02,739 --> 01:51:05,708
...the defendant in jail by then?
A couple of weeks?

1671
01:51:06,910 --> 01:51:08,502
I don't remember, exactly.

1672
01:51:09,813 --> 01:51:11,678
Well, let me help you out.

1673
01:51:12,315 --> 01:51:15,250
It was over eight months.

1674
01:51:15,685 --> 01:51:17,380
Eight months.

1675
01:51:17,587 --> 01:51:20,647
You let your buddy sit in jail
all that time...

1676
01:51:20,857 --> 01:51:24,054
...and never once told anyone,
"You've got the wrong guy."

1677
01:51:24,260 --> 01:51:26,387
You're asking this jury
to believe that?

1678
01:51:27,297 --> 01:51:28,525
Yes, sir.

1679
01:51:32,168 --> 01:51:35,968
Earlier in your testimony, you said
that you and I are friends, right?

1680
01:51:36,406 --> 01:51:37,236
Said what?

1681
01:51:37,474 --> 01:51:40,375
That we're friends.
You and I are friends.

1682
01:51:42,612 --> 01:51:44,580
You still think we're friends?

1683
01:51:45,782 --> 01:51:46,976
Sure.

1684
01:51:48,885 --> 01:51:51,410
As my friend, if I ever go
to jail for murder...

1685
01:51:51,621 --> 01:51:53,521
...don't leave me there
for eight months...

1686
01:51:53,723 --> 01:51:56,191
...if you know where I was
when the murder took place.

1687
01:51:56,393 --> 01:51:57,223
Objection!

1688
01:51:57,560 --> 01:51:58,925
That was a thing of beauty.

1689
01:51:59,129 --> 01:52:00,255
Nothing further.

1690
01:52:00,463 --> 01:52:01,725
Will you redirect?

1691
01:52:01,931 --> 01:52:03,558
Thank you, Your Honor.

1692
01:52:04,934 --> 01:52:06,561
Would you lie for Mr. Beckwith?

1693
01:52:07,470 --> 01:52:08,869
Did he ask you to?

1694
01:52:09,105 --> 01:52:12,597
As a former police officer,
you know perjury is a serious crime.

1695
01:52:13,543 --> 01:52:15,636
I'm gonna ask you this one last time.

1696
01:52:15,845 --> 01:52:18,279
On the night that Medgar Evers
was killed...

1697
01:52:18,481 --> 01:52:23,009
...did you or did you not see
Beckwith some 95 miles away...

1698
01:52:23,219 --> 01:52:24,982
...from where the murder took place?

1699
01:52:26,723 --> 01:52:27,815
I saw him.

1700
01:52:28,024 --> 01:52:30,686
As God is your judge.

1701
01:52:32,095 --> 01:52:34,290
As God is my judge.

1702
01:52:35,165 --> 01:52:38,100
Thank you, Mr. Holley.
We have nothing further.

1703
01:52:41,371 --> 01:52:42,838
No further questions.

1704
01:52:44,174 --> 01:52:45,141
You may step down.

1705
01:52:49,078 --> 01:52:51,512
Is the defense prepared to call
its next witness?

1706
01:53:01,891 --> 01:53:03,085
Your Honor...

1707
01:53:03,426 --> 01:53:05,553
...the defense rests.

1708
01:53:07,030 --> 01:53:08,691
-What?
-Damn!

1709
01:53:09,999 --> 01:53:10,988
Quiet.

1710
01:53:12,702 --> 01:53:13,634
Ladies and gentlemen.

1711
01:53:13,970 --> 01:53:16,734
Quiet or I'll order the bailiff
to clear the courtroom.

1712
01:53:16,940 --> 01:53:19,135
Coward to the end.

1713
01:53:23,446 --> 01:53:25,107
To my knowledge...

1714
01:53:25,315 --> 01:53:28,011
...this jury is being asked
to look further...

1715
01:53:28,218 --> 01:53:31,244
...into the past than any jury...

1716
01:53:31,955 --> 01:53:35,288
...in the history
of American jurisprudence.

1717
01:53:35,725 --> 01:53:40,094
That places you folks
at a considerable disadvantage.

1718
01:53:40,697 --> 01:53:43,666
Evidence has been lost.

1719
01:53:44,534 --> 01:53:46,593
They don't have the bullet.

1720
01:53:46,970 --> 01:53:51,270
They don't have the spent cartridge
case that was found in the gun.

1721
01:53:51,474 --> 01:53:55,467
They don't have the live ammunition
that was found in the gun.

1722
01:53:55,812 --> 01:53:57,336
Where is it?

1723
01:53:58,414 --> 01:54:00,075
Nobody knows.

1724
01:54:00,984 --> 01:54:03,509
Does this create reasonable doubt?

1725
01:54:03,820 --> 01:54:05,583
Of course it does.

1726
01:54:06,422 --> 01:54:09,448
And you have heard a number
of witnesses testify...

1727
01:54:09,659 --> 01:54:13,060
...that years after the crime,
Mr. Beckwith said this...

1728
01:54:13,263 --> 01:54:15,254
...or Mr. Beckwith said that.

1729
01:54:15,532 --> 01:54:19,901
But the defense has presented you
with an eyewitness.

1730
01:54:20,103 --> 01:54:22,799
A sworn officer of the law...

1731
01:54:23,006 --> 01:54:27,375
...who has testified under oath
that he saw the defendant...

1732
01:54:27,577 --> 01:54:32,139
...in Greenwood, Mississippi,
over 90 miles from Jackson...

1733
01:54:32,348 --> 01:54:35,283
...Iess than an hour after the murder.

1734
01:54:36,886 --> 01:54:39,184
Does that create reasonable doubt?

1735
01:54:40,023 --> 01:54:41,650
You bet it does.

1736
01:54:42,358 --> 01:54:46,260
And reasonable doubt
means one thing...

1737
01:54:46,529 --> 01:54:48,360
...and one thing only.

1738
01:54:48,965 --> 01:54:50,364
By law...

1739
01:54:50,633 --> 01:54:54,296
...you must render
a not guilty verdict.

1740
01:54:55,104 --> 01:54:58,505
Forget that it's Byron "Delay" Beckwith.

1741
01:54:58,975 --> 01:55:02,433
Forget that you may not like him,
that you...

1742
01:55:02,645 --> 01:55:04,806
...may not agree with him.

1743
01:55:05,882 --> 01:55:07,713
Judge the evidence...

1744
01:55:08,351 --> 01:55:10,319
...and judge it fairly.

1745
01:55:11,321 --> 01:55:12,686
Because...

1746
01:55:12,889 --> 01:55:15,153
...in the United States...

1747
01:55:15,558 --> 01:55:19,824
...we don't do that for people
we just like and admire.

1748
01:55:20,997 --> 01:55:23,295
We do that for everybody...

1749
01:55:23,499 --> 01:55:24,864
...that's on trial...

1750
01:55:25,068 --> 01:55:27,366
...in an American court of law.

1751
01:55:28,104 --> 01:55:31,164
Because if the system doesn't work...

1752
01:55:31,374 --> 01:55:33,365
...for Byron De La Beckwith...

1753
01:55:33,576 --> 01:55:34,600
...it doesn't work...

1754
01:55:35,111 --> 01:55:36,738
...for anyone.

1755
01:55:37,480 --> 01:55:41,473
I ask you to let the system work...

1756
01:55:43,019 --> 01:55:45,078
...and once and for all...

1757
01:55:45,421 --> 01:55:47,252
...find the defendant...

1758
01:55:47,590 --> 01:55:51,026
...Byron De La Beckwith,
not guilty.

1759
01:55:53,796 --> 01:55:55,263
Thank you.

1760
01:56:09,879 --> 01:56:11,870
An unarmed man...

1761
01:56:12,382 --> 01:56:15,681
...arrives home in the late hours
of the night...

1762
01:56:15,885 --> 01:56:18,683
...home to his family, his wife...

1763
01:56:18,888 --> 01:56:20,879
...and three small children...

1764
01:56:21,624 --> 01:56:23,717
...gets out of his car...

1765
01:56:24,293 --> 01:56:26,454
...and with his back turned...

1766
01:56:26,796 --> 01:56:29,287
...is gunned down by a coward.

1767
01:56:31,234 --> 01:56:33,099
That coward is...

1768
01:56:33,302 --> 01:56:34,894
...Byron De La Beckwith.

1769
01:56:36,072 --> 01:56:37,471
His gun.

1770
01:56:37,907 --> 01:56:39,272
His scope.

1771
01:56:39,475 --> 01:56:40,874
His fingerprint.

1772
01:56:41,077 --> 01:56:42,374
His car.

1773
01:56:42,578 --> 01:56:46,708
And lastly, but certainly not least,
his mouth.

1774
01:56:47,917 --> 01:56:49,782
When he thought he got away with it...

1775
01:56:49,986 --> 01:56:53,615
...he couldn't keep his mouth shut
with people he wanted to impress.

1776
01:56:53,823 --> 01:56:56,815
And now his venom has come back
to do him in...

1777
01:56:57,026 --> 01:56:58,653
...because, ladies and gentlemen...

1778
01:56:58,861 --> 01:57:02,353
...there is no statute
of limitations on murder.

1779
01:57:02,932 --> 01:57:05,560
The law doesn't say
that if you killed someone...

1780
01:57:05,768 --> 01:57:07,633
... 10 years ago or 20 years ago...

1781
01:57:07,837 --> 01:57:11,898
...or even 30 years ago,
that you don't have to pay the price.

1782
01:57:12,108 --> 01:57:16,067
The law doesn't say that if you are
50 years old or 60 years old...

1783
01:57:16,279 --> 01:57:20,238
...or 70 years old,
that you don't have to pay the price.

1784
01:57:20,450 --> 01:57:22,111
No man...

1785
01:57:22,952 --> 01:57:24,749
...is above the law.

1786
01:57:27,557 --> 01:57:29,320
And for what reason...

1787
01:57:29,525 --> 01:57:31,425
...was Medgar Evers' life taken?

1788
01:57:31,627 --> 01:57:35,927
For wanting some degree
of equality for himself...

1789
01:57:36,132 --> 01:57:38,498
...his family and his fellow man.

1790
01:57:38,701 --> 01:57:42,797
Ladies and gentlemen,
when that kind of murder happens...

1791
01:57:43,206 --> 01:57:45,470
...no matter who the victim...

1792
01:57:45,875 --> 01:57:48,173
...no matter what his race...

1793
01:57:48,377 --> 01:57:50,777
...there is a gaping wound...

1794
01:57:50,980 --> 01:57:54,313
...Iaid open on society as a whole.

1795
01:57:56,319 --> 01:57:57,718
Justice...

1796
01:57:58,321 --> 01:58:00,312
...has sometimes been referred to...

1797
01:58:00,523 --> 01:58:02,491
...as the soothing balm
to be applied...

1798
01:58:02,692 --> 01:58:05,252
...to the wounds inflicted on society.

1799
01:58:05,461 --> 01:58:07,258
But when there is no justice...

1800
01:58:07,463 --> 01:58:10,728
...those wounds can never be cleansed.

1801
01:58:11,667 --> 01:58:14,898
Those wounds can never be healed.

1802
01:58:17,573 --> 01:58:20,007
When I addressed you
in my opening statement...

1803
01:58:20,209 --> 01:58:23,076
...I said that this was a simple case.

1804
01:58:23,279 --> 01:58:25,839
Well, I was right and I was wrong.

1805
01:58:26,182 --> 01:58:28,207
The evidence is simple...

1806
01:58:28,417 --> 01:58:30,476
...and the conclusion is
more than obvious.

1807
01:58:30,686 --> 01:58:32,278
But the reason we are all...

1808
01:58:32,488 --> 01:58:35,116
...sitting in this courtroom
so many years after...

1809
01:58:35,324 --> 01:58:38,020
...this disgraceful
assassination took place...

1810
01:58:38,261 --> 01:58:40,923
...is anything but simple.

1811
01:58:43,266 --> 01:58:45,234
President John F. Kennedy...

1812
01:58:45,434 --> 01:58:48,267
...in his landmark civil rights speech
to the nation...

1813
01:58:48,471 --> 01:58:52,840
...delivered on the very night
Medgar Evers was murdered, said...

1814
01:58:53,042 --> 01:58:56,773
... "We face a moral crisis
as a country...

1815
01:58:57,046 --> 01:58:58,536
...and as a people.

1816
01:58:59,448 --> 01:59:03,179
Those who do nothing are
inviting shame...

1817
01:59:03,386 --> 01:59:05,547
...as well as violence.

1818
01:59:05,855 --> 01:59:10,087
Those who act boldly are
recognizing right...

1819
01:59:10,860 --> 01:59:13,351
...as well as reality."

1820
01:59:14,630 --> 01:59:17,793
Today, 30 years later...

1821
01:59:18,134 --> 01:59:20,466
...on behalf of the state
of Mississippi...

1822
01:59:20,670 --> 01:59:25,471
...I'm asking you 12 ladies
and gentlemen to act boldly.

1823
01:59:25,741 --> 01:59:29,700
To hold this defendant accountable
and find him guilty...

1824
01:59:29,912 --> 01:59:31,937
...simply because it is right...

1825
01:59:32,148 --> 01:59:33,445
...it is just...

1826
01:59:33,649 --> 01:59:36,743
...and Lord knows, it is time.

1827
01:59:40,323 --> 01:59:41,654
Is it ever...

1828
01:59:42,225 --> 01:59:44,955
...too late to do the right thing?

1829
01:59:47,430 --> 01:59:49,728
For the sake of justice...

1830
01:59:49,932 --> 01:59:53,993
...and for the hope of us
as a civilized society...

1831
01:59:55,104 --> 01:59:58,904
...I sincerely pray that it is not.

1832
02:00:02,311 --> 02:00:03,300
Thank you.

1833
02:00:05,948 --> 02:00:07,779
How long do you think they'll be out?

1834
02:00:08,117 --> 02:00:11,644
All I know is a short time is good
and a long time is...

1835
02:00:12,054 --> 02:00:12,952
...not so good.

1836
02:00:13,456 --> 02:00:15,390
Then I'll pray for a short time.

1837
02:00:17,526 --> 02:00:20,359
This reminds me of Medgar's office
on Lynch Street.

1838
02:00:20,563 --> 02:00:23,327
You know, I used to be
Medgar's secretary.

1839
02:00:24,433 --> 02:00:26,731
He insisted that we behave
in the office...

1840
02:00:26,936 --> 02:00:29,837
...strictly as employer-employee.

1841
02:00:30,039 --> 02:00:33,600
He'd call me Mrs. Evers,
and I'd have to call him Mr. Evers.

1842
02:00:33,809 --> 02:00:35,276
Is that right?

1843
02:00:35,711 --> 02:00:37,838
Everybody thought he was crazy.

1844
02:00:38,047 --> 02:00:41,346
But he was just so determined
to do a good job.

1845
02:00:45,054 --> 02:00:46,783
You remind me of Medgar.

1846
02:00:52,228 --> 02:00:53,661
Thank you, ma'am.

1847
02:00:54,830 --> 02:00:56,821
Would you like a cup of coffee?

1848
02:00:57,066 --> 02:00:58,260
No, thanks.

1849
02:01:00,436 --> 02:01:04,236
As many trials as I've been through
and I can never take the waiting.

1850
02:01:04,674 --> 02:01:05,766
Wanna go for a walk?

1851
02:01:06,175 --> 02:01:09,269
No, you go ahead. I've gotten
pretty good at waiting.

1852
02:01:28,931 --> 02:01:30,398
That Judge Hilburn...

1853
02:01:30,599 --> 02:01:32,294
...he don't have a lot of patience.

1854
02:01:32,501 --> 02:01:35,265
That jury ain't back with a verdict
in a few hours...

1855
02:01:35,471 --> 02:01:36,836
...he'll declare a mistrial.

1856
02:01:37,039 --> 02:01:38,802
I'm not sure I got that.

1857
02:01:39,008 --> 02:01:41,841
Would you mind repeating that,
please?

1858
02:01:42,044 --> 02:01:43,807
You did say mistrial, didn't you?

1859
02:01:44,013 --> 02:01:45,241
I'm gonna snooch you.

1860
02:02:01,330 --> 02:02:02,558
All rise.

1861
02:02:21,350 --> 02:02:23,284
When the verdict is read...

1862
02:02:23,486 --> 02:02:25,852
...there will be no demonstrations...

1863
02:02:26,055 --> 02:02:29,047
...or any emotional outbursts
of any type.

1864
02:02:54,350 --> 02:02:56,545
Has the jury reached a verdict?

1865
02:02:57,253 --> 02:02:58,584
It has, Your Honor.

1866
02:02:58,788 --> 02:03:00,722
If the bailiff will hand me
the verdict.

1867
02:03:24,980 --> 02:03:28,575
I'll ask the jury at this time
to stand and face the defendant.

1868
02:03:32,755 --> 02:03:34,655
The defendant will face the jury.

1869
02:03:42,898 --> 02:03:45,366
The jury foreman will now
read the verdict.

1870
02:03:47,470 --> 02:03:48,698
We the jury...

1871
02:03:48,904 --> 02:03:50,303
...find the defendant...

1872
02:03:50,506 --> 02:03:54,636
...Byron De La Beckwith,
guilty as charged.

1873
02:04:02,485 --> 02:04:04,146
-Quiet in this courtroom.
-Guilty.

1874
02:04:38,053 --> 02:04:41,250
Mrs. Evers, how did you feel
when the verdict came in?

1875
02:05:03,479 --> 02:05:06,971
It's been a long journey.

1876
02:05:10,186 --> 02:05:13,349
Medgar, I've gone the last mile
of the way.

1877
02:05:14,857 --> 02:05:17,917
I've gone the last mile of the way.

1878
02:05:20,329 --> 02:05:22,320
And all I want to say...

1879
02:05:22,898 --> 02:05:25,059
...is yea, Medgar!

1880
02:05:26,059 --> 02:05:36,059
