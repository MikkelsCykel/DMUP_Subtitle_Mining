1
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,700
Thanks.

2
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,700
Good luck, mate.
- Yeah.

3
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,700
Come on in.

4
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,200
- Hi. How are you?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Do you know Kylie?

5
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,800
Right here. Come on, buddy.

6
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,300
Hey. I missed the bus.

7
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:31,100
Not till tomorrow. Around midday.

8
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,500
I don't think you're gonna find it in there.

9
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,800
You know, whatever it is you're looking for.

10
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,900
Yeah, true.
But it's not for me, it's for my friend.

11
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,400
Fucking thing has been following me
around all day.

12
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:17,600
Taylor.
- Hey, there she is.

13
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,000
You good?

14
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,500
- Take care.
Take it easy.

15
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,700
You wanna get a drink?

16
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,100
Pretty sure it's gonna be more fun
than sitting here all night.

17
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,100
Yeah, I'd love to, but I've got
to find somewhere to stay.

18
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,900
- I can help you with that.
- Yeah?

19
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Come on. I need you.
You'd be helping me out.

20
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,700
- Okay.
- Good. Fantastic.

21
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,900
Breakfast time.

22
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:06,800
Come on, man, let's go. Come on.

23
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,200
We got a long drive.

24
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,200
Shit, those girls crack me up, man.
They're wild.

25
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:25,100
Shame we had to leave so quick.
She's gonna miss you.

26
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,600
I would have said goodbye,
if she would have woken up.

27
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,300
- You got a girlfriend?
- No.

28
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,000
No, it's just that I was meant to be
in Byron yesterday,

29
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,400
'cause I've got some friends waiting for me.

30
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,500
- Where are you headed after Byron?
- Don't know.

31
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,500
Just get up there
and then see what happens.

32
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,400
- That sounds good.
- Yeah.

33
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,000
Thanks for the lift. I should

34
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,200
help you pay for some petrol.

35
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,700
What are you doing? Don't worry about it.
I'm going further than you, anyway.

36
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,800
Besides, it's good to have
a little company during the trip.

37
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,400
No, it's fair.

38
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,400
Are these Polaroids
of everywhere you've been?

39
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,900
You've been to a lot of places.

40
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,600
Kind of all over, yeah.

41
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
There's a pen in there. Just write
your name and whatever else you'd like.

42
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,600
Bit of an expensive way of
taking pictures, isn't it?

43
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,900
Don't forget the date.

44
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:46,500
Her name was Lena, by the way.
In case you don't remember.

45
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,100
- You up for some breakfast?
- Sure. Yeah, good idea.

46
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,100
Good. I'm so hungry I could eat my own ass.

47
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,700
We'll go halves.

48
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,800
$12, please.

49
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,600
How much for half a sausage?

50
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,900
Don't worry, I'll get it.

51
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,700
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

52
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,900
- Is that good?
- Yeah, thank you, thank you.

53
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,200
Yeah. Back in a tick.

54
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,700
Come on! Don't puss out on me now, boy!

55
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,700
Oh, it's freezing, man.

56
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,700
Who's Sophie?

57
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,200
What?

58
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,700
I forgot to say, you got a...
You got a message on your phone.

59
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,700
- On... On me phone?
- Yeah, I forgot to say.

60
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,300
You were in the bathroom, I think.
It went off, I thought...

61
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,300
I don't know, I thought it might have been
the girls, so I just had a quick peek.

62
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,100
Sorry.

63
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,000
No, it's okay.

64
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,200
So, is Sophie the reason you wanted
to get out so quick this morning?

65
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,200
I drank too much, mate. Too much.

66
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,900
She's not here, is she?

67
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,700
She's not in Byron, is she?

68
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,300
- Yeah.
- Fuck.

69
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,200
You gotta be kidding me.

70
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,900
So how long you been going out with her?

71
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,200
- Couple of years.
- Yeah?

72
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,300
We met at college. Not on the first day
or anything corny like that.

73
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,400
- Second.
- Third.

74
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,200
How come she's out here?

75
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,400
She...

76
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,800
She only left college this year,
and she could get a cheap ticket

77
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,500
if she came earlier. Plus, I had to
finish some shit job I was in, so...

78
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,200
- Right, right, right.
- Plan is to head up to Katherine's Gorge.

79
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,700
Do you know it? See what happens.

80
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,900
You should have told me.

81
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,400
Instead of carrying that shit.

82
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:54,100
I was beginning to think you'd gotten
bored of the obnoxious American already.

83
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,400
Well...

84
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,500
- You tool.
- Come on. Human race.

85
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,500
We make mistakes.

86
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:11,100
Don't beat yourself up about it.
I'm on your side. Let's go.

87
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,900
So, listen, I really want to say thanks.

88
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,100
Can I settle up for any more fuel
or anything?

89
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,400
Don't worry about that.
You did more than enough of that.

90
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,500
I should be thanking you.

91
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,400
So, where are we meeting her?

92
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,000
Looks like everyone's been having fun.

93
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,500
Sophie.

94
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,900
I missed you.

95
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,200
Who's this? Hello.

96
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,600
Oh, this is Ingrid. She's German.

97
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,000
We were dancing. There was a party.

98
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,800
Hi.

99
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,600
- Oh, hi.
- Oh, yeah, this is... This is Taylor.

100
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:35,000
We met in Sydney. He gave me a lift.

101
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,100
I just brought your man back for you.

102
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,100
- Look what I found.
- Oh, wow!

103
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,300
Oh, no!

104
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,600
You ready?

105
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,700
You know, I've been thinking.

106
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,900
What do you guys think about
all of us travelling together?

107
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,500
Forget the bus. Bus is a pain in the ass.

108
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:14,100
I just spent $300 on a hop-on, hop-off
Whipper Snapper bus pass.

109
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,200
Did he just say that?

110
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,600
Come on, it could be fun!

111
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,700
All right.

112
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,500
I'm taking it that's a yes, then. Come on.

113
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,700
What?
- What?

114
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,100
- Whipper Snapper.
- Whipper Snapper.

115
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,300
- You want to see it?
- No.

116
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,700
You sure?

117
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,600
Leave me, I don't want to go! Go!

118
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,200
<i>Look, Dad let me watch Jaws
at an early age.</i>

119
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,300
- Come on!
- Give me a kiss before you go. Be careful.

120
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,900
- Morning, kids.
Morning.

121
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,500
Morning.

122
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:13,300
- Are you sure this is okay?
- What? Hanging out with good people?

123
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,900
Having some fun?
Yeah, it's okay. Is that okay with you?

124
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,900
Yeah, definitely.

125
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,000
Go put your stuff in the back.
How about you?

126
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,700
It's good. Fine, yeah.

127
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,400
What are you doing?

128
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,900
Thought we better take care of this
before we forgot.

129
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,700
All right, let's have a picture.

130
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,600
- Shouldn't we wait for Ingrid?
- Yes, she said to say sorry.

131
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,500
She had to catch the early bus.

132
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,300
Something about a friend
she'd forgotten about.

133
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,800
I always have that effect on women.

134
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,100
- You okay?
- Yeah.

135
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:31,100
No. I'm just a bit pissed off with Ingrid.

136
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,700
I know. She didn't even say goodbye.

137
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,300
Have you got her phone number
or anything?

138
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:39,000
No. Nothing.

139
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,500
Well...

140
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,500
Taylor looks like his night
caught up on him, anyway.

141
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:50,300
- Yeah, I reckon so.
- Well, he'll find another girl soon.

142
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,700
Just wish it was you and me. That's all.

143
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,600
- Here it is. Pull up over there.
- Okay.

144
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,400
I'm just gonna hop out.

145
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,400
Just go around the back
if anyone tries to move you.

146
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,000
You hungry? You look famished.

147
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,900
- I do?
- Come on.

148
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:23,100
You got luggage going on?
What is that? What is all that?

149
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,100
No.

150
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:24,400
- Taylor.
- He's asleep.

151
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,900
Taylor?

152
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,600
Taylor? See?

153
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,900
- Okay. Be really quiet.
- Okay.

154
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,700
Oh, shit.

155
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,100
Taylor?

156
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,600
Taylor, come on!

157
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,400
Taylor?

158
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:14,000
He's pissed off, that's all. No big deal.

159
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,500
- Hi.
- Hi.

160
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:41,100
- I'm sorry about last night.
- No, are you insane? I'm sorry.

161
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:45,900
I completely overreacted. I should've
actually slept in the tent, anyway.

162
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:50,400
- In the van. Given you guys a bit of space.
- No, no, we...

163
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,700
We put you in an awkward position.

164
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,700
How did you sleep?

165
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,000
It's a little bit of a hotbox after 7:00.

166
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,800
- Trying to describe what an asshole I am?
- No.

167
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,700
- No?
- No, it's just stuff. Thoughts.

168
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,100
It's kind of like what I do
with my Polaroids. You know,

169
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,300
remember things.

170
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:45,300
Not that it's gonna be too hard to remember
the American freaking out in your tent.

171
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:50,900
I think it's good to go a bit nutty sometimes.
You know, it gets it out of your system.

172
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,000
Yeah?

173
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,700
Hey.

174
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,800
Hey, man. I just wanted to say sorry.
I was pretty upset.

175
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,300
No, I was... I was in the wrong.

176
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,200
I'm not doing it.

177
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:47,800
- I think he feels a bit stupid.
- Well, I think he is a bit stupid.

178
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,400
I think we should still get the bus.

179
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:04,300
It feels really mean. Just...
We can't just leave straightaway.

180
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,600
- Oh, Sophie...
- Alex, come on. We'll get the bus.

181
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,600
Let's just give it a day, you know?

182
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:14,200
It was our fault. It was your fault.

183
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,900
- You mean my fault?
- Yeah.

184
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:55,000
I think you were right
about that thing earlier.

185
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,300
- It's like a well-tailored suit.
- What, when it's cut?

186
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:06,200
Where are you going? Sophie?

187
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:10,100
Whoa, whoa, man.

188
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,800
Maybe you should slow down.

189
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,500
- I think we should go in harder.
- Yeah, it's rubbish soft.

190
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:31,000
Yes, it is a bit rubbish soft.
I think it's time for some shots.

191
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,100
Looks like he's off on one.

192
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:55,300
He's got that look in his eye.

193
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,700
Cheers.

194
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,700
Cheers.

195
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,300
What's wrong with Sofe?

196
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:55,100
- Her name is Sophie.
- Okay, Sophie.

197
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:58,200
- What's wrong with Sophie?
- She's pissed off with me.

198
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,800
Yeah?

199
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,800
Hey, listen, bartender wants me to settle up.

200
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,100
Jamie?

201
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,400
It's that American guy.

202
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,000
- Jamie?
- Sorry.

203
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:22,900
Jamie? It's Jamie, isn't it?

204
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,300
- It's Jamie from Thailand.
You got the wrong guy.

205
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:29,000
- You want to take care of your girl here?
See, American.

206
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,600
How many fucking Americans
with a poncey tattoo for a start?

207
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,600
I have no idea what you're talking about.

208
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:37,200
All right, Jamie, you know very well.

209
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,900
Listen, I've never met you before in my life.

210
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,200
You're cute, but I've never been to Thailand.

211
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,500
You barefaced fucking liar!

212
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,900
She's had a couple of drinks, mate.
Yeah, just walk away.

213
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,700
Don't you walk away from me,
you lying prick!

214
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,600
Fuck off, you fat piece of shit!

215
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:01,700
I'll call the fucking police, I will!
Serious, I'll fucking call them!

216
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,100
- Who's that?
- No idea.

217
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,500
- You bastard!
- Seems pretty certain she knew you.

218
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,800
- What's she calling you, Jamie?
- You good for a drink?

219
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,900
Yeah, I just... I just bought myself one.

220
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,600
Wouldn't have thought she was your type.
She's a right minger.

221
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,800
Don't listen to him. He's a fucking liar!

222
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,400
You American bastard!

223
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,600
Shit. No wonder you gave her
a false name, Jamie.

224
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,100
That's funny.

225
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,600
We've all fucked some girls
we wish we hadn't have, Alex.

226
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,600
I'm gonna go.

227
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,400
Hey.

228
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,900
Did you manage to get him to bed?

229
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,400
He seemed pretty out of it.

230
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:56,300
He wasn't that bad when we got back.

231
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:03,300
Looks like you had a few problems
as well this evening.

232
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:06,200
I told you, I have a funny effect on women.

233
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,700
She looked really upset.

234
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:16,700
You're right. That wasn't very funny.

235
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,200
Where did you meet her?

236
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,500
Thailand.

237
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,400
I was pretty messed up back then.

238
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,600
Not a very good person to be around.

239
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:34,100
I didn't behave very well
towards a friend of hers.

240
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:40,000
Tried to apologise to her tonight,
but she was too angry.

241
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,800
Nimming.

242
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,300
- What?
- The thing with your leg.

243
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:06,900
Nimming.

244
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:25,100
It's funny how it just kind of does it
by itself, huh?

245
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,800
I should get back.

246
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,600
Sophie, wait.

247
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,200
Thank you.

248
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,500
Fuck's sake.

249
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:32,400
Morning, boozer.

250
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:41,300
- Was it a... Was it a good swim?
- It was great.

251
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,500
I tried to wake you.

252
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:55,600
That was weird last night.
I don't think you saw.

253
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:59,500
That girl, some big Scottish unit,
started having a go at Taylor,

254
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,800
accusing him of stuff.
Started calling him Jamie.

255
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:08,200
Called him Jamie, for fuck's sake.

256
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,500
- It's his christened name.
- Is it?

257
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,200
Yeah, he told me.

258
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,300
When?

259
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:23,600
This morning. He swam, too.

260
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:28,000
He didn't drink too much?

261
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,400
No.

262
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,900
Just your boyfriend.

263
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:55,800
Maybe we should go our own way
when we get to the next town.

264
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,600
Just the two of us.

265
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,000
Good plan.

266
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:09,600
Yeah, we can be together.
We'll have a laugh.

267
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:13,200
- I can get out me Whipper Snapper.
- You're always keen to do that.

268
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,600
Yes, I am.

269
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,800
Alex.

270
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,100
All right.
At least you could pretend to look happy.

271
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,100
That's nice.

272
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,700
Taylor, Sophie and I
are thinking of moving on.

273
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:35,000
There's a place called Longreach.

274
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,800
Yeah. We wanted...

275
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,600
There's a bus from there.

276
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,000
- Longreach, huh?
- Yeah.

277
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:48,200
The bus leaves tomorrow.
It only goes once a week, so...

278
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,100
Sure.

279
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:26,700
- Hey, can you do some driving?
- Me?

280
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,400
Yeah, I don't know how to get to
this place. I'm guessing you do.

281
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,300
Wanna hop in the back?

282
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,400
Let me see.

283
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:33,100
- Fucking hell.
- What are we gonna do?

284
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,800
I don't know.

285
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,800
Oh, my God, Alex.

286
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:49,100
- Sophie, you okay?
- Yeah.

287
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,700
Let me take a look at that, man.

288
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,600
Fuck.

289
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:22,100
I know they're in here somewhere.
- Shut up. Stop fussing.

290
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,600
I'm trying to help you.

291
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,700
I feel... It'll be all right.
Just don't worry about it.

292
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:33,500
Just need to get to Longreach,
and then we can split from him.

293
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:38,400
Alex, you just...

294
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:42,300
What? Go on, what?

295
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,800
The guy's...

296
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,700
Just trust me, he's bad news.

297
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:51,000
What?

298
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:55,300
Hey, Alex, we're in the middle of nowhere.

299
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,500
Are you pissed off at me?

300
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,600
No.

301
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,800
- A bit, yeah. But...
- Why?

302
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,900
It doesn't...

303
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,500
Sophie, you and Taylor, there's no...

304
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,700
- Jesus.
- What?

305
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,700
He couldn't keep his fucking eyes
off you earlier at the petrol station.

306
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:26,000
- You know what I'm taking about.
- What's got into you?

307
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:28,200
We're lucky that we're okay.

308
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:29,600
What? You don't get it, do you?

309
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,700
Don't you understand
what he's trying to do?

310
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,500
Are you fucking thick?

311
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,700
Alex. Hey, baby.

312
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,300
Alex.

313
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:28,300
Take these.

314
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:47,000
- So you found them?
- Taylor had some.

315
00:44:57,900 --> 00:44:59,700
- Hey.
- Hi.

316
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:02,200
I just got him some water and paracetamol.

317
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,800
Hopefully it'll lower his temperature,
help him sleep better.

318
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
- Thank you. How much?
- Peanuts. Don't worry about it.

319
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:10,900
Oh, and I got a doctor to stop by the room.

320
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,300
He's gonna stop at the hotel around 3:00
to check up on him.

321
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,600
Brilliant. Thank you.

322
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:19,700
- Here.
- I think it's better if I go on my own.

323
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,400
- Yeah, sure. No problem.
- Okay.

324
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:31,000
Alex?

325
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:34,600
Shit. Shit.

326
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:37,700
Alex? Alex?

327
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,300
God.
- I was looking for a picture.

328
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,300
- Okay.
- There's a picture... A photograph...

329
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:46,100
Jesus, look at you.

330
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:47,700
- Alex.
- Where are we?

331
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:50,300
- Okay, come on. Let's get out of here.
- Don't touch me. Don't touch me.

332
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:53,600
Sophie, you know what he did?
He fucking...

333
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:58,100
- The pills... He's fucking... Those pills.
- Alex.

334
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:01,900
I got to get the bus.
We've got to get the bus quick.

335
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:03,800
- I gotta get the bus.
- We're gonna get the bus.

336
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,200
I feel sick 'cause he's trying to poison...

337
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,600
I got you. I got you. I got you.

338
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:14,700
Don't touch me! Don't touch me!
Don't touch me! Fuck off!

339
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,900
Get away from us!
Get the fuck away from us!

340
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:01,000
Alex.

341
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:03,900
Alex.

342
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:08,000
Alex. Hey.

343
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,100
Over here.

344
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:18,200
- Oh, shit. Shit.
- Hey, it's okay. It's okay.

345
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:21,400
Sophie's sleeping.

346
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:26,600
Got you some water.
How you feeling? Any better?

347
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:42,600
You know, Alex, you shouldn't treat people
the way that you do.

348
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:48,600
Don't cheat on people.

349
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:53,900
Don't lie to people.

350
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:01,400
It only comes back on you.

351
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,800
Who are you? Who the fuck are you?

352
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:02,200
Hey, you. How you doing?

353
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:09,300
Oh, fuck.

354
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:17,400
Come on, Sophie.

355
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:21,800
Babe? Babe?

356
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:27,000
- I need to get some stuff out of the van.
- Okay, no worries.

357
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:30,200
- It's just in the parking lot.
- Is it fixed?

358
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:32,600
I fixed it.

359
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:35,300
The key.

360
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:39,100
- What, you want to get your backpack?
- Yeah.

361
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:43,200
- Oh, I brought it for you already, and Alex's.
- Oh, thank you.

362
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:47,400
Just brought it in when I went upstairs.
Popped in with some water for Alex.

363
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:50,700
- You saw Alex?
- You were asleep,

364
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:54,300
so I just kind of went
in. Didn't really talk.

365
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:01,800
Shit.

366
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:08,000
- What?
- My hand. It's just burning.

367
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,700
It was the accident. It keeps going like that.

368
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,600
- Really? Let me see.
- Yeah.

369
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,400
Comes and goes.

370
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:34,100
Thank you for bringing the bags back.

371
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,700
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.

372
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:45,900
Good night.

373
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,500
I saw you with him. I saw you.

374
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:25,600
So, what, you... Do you like Taylor?

375
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:32,300
Alex, listen, nothing is going on.

376
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:38,400
Then, if there's nothing going on,
why are you holding hands in the bar?

377
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:46,800
He's fucking with us, Sofe.
He's fucking with you.

378
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:51,000
Alex, please calm down.

379
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:58,000
I'm here with you.

380
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:01,000
I love you.

381
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:06,600
Yeah, and the van's fixed.

382
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:13,200
Well, as long as the van's fixed.

383
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:18,600
So, Taylor can drop us somewhere,
and then it can be just us.

384
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,600
Alex, you're ill.

385
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:36,300
Either we go with him
and we get a bus from Mount Isa,

386
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:38,700
or we stay here for a week.

387
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:41,600
Which is it?

388
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:18,400
Have you still got it?

389
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:21,900
I should give it to you.
You should have it.

390
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:27,000
Hey, Alex, where are those pictures?

391
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:32,200
Those photos, remember? I wanted to give
you guys that picture. You know the one.

392
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,400
I think they're in here.

393
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:39,000
Pull over. Pull over!

394
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:45,900
Alex?

395
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,400
Alex?

396
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,900
Shit. I should go see if he's all right.

397
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:56,000
No, I'll go. This is between me and him.

398
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:33,200
- Hey.
- Hey.

399
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:39,500
Come on.

400
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,600
You know where she was last night?

401
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:48,900
She was with me.

402
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:51,800
You were vomiting.

403
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:55,600
You were shitting, remember that?

404
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:58,600
She was with me.

405
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:07,200
She was with me.

406
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,400
Come on! Come on!

407
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:14,500
Alex!

408
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:19,300
- Alex!
Fuck, what are you doing?

409
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:22,900
- What are you doing? What are you doing?
- Alex, what the fuck are you doing?

410
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:24,500
Take a fucking breath.

411
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:28,400
Don't touch him! Don't touch him!

412
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:40,800
Sofe...

413
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:45,200
Sofe, he's...
He's gonna show you a photograph.

414
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:47,500
What photograph?

415
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:50,400
He took a picture of me
the first night I met him in Sydney.

416
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:53,600
Remember, I told you I got drunk.
Well, he took a picture.

417
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:58,100
- I don't think I wanna hear this.
- I met a girl.

418
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:00,500
And then...

419
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:04,500
All along, nothing happened.
Nothing happened.

420
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:07,400
And I know you probably don't believe me,
but nothing happened.

421
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:10,700
But this picture shows me asleep with her
the next day.

422
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:21,700
- Is that what this is about?
- Her name was Lena and...

423
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:24,900
God, I'm sure nothing happened.

424
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:32,800
If nothing happened,
then why couldn't you tell me about it?

425
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:45,000
No, don't go! Sophie, don't go!
What's important is he took a picture,

426
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:48,000
and he said that he threw it away,
but he kept it!

427
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:50,900
And he's gonna show it to you
to use against me, against us!

428
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:52,900
Sophie, nothing happened!

429
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:12,200
Wait. Why did you get separate rooms?

430
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:14,800
Why did you spend the night
with some girl in a photograph?

431
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,700
Are you going off with him?

432
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:20,100
Sophie, just tell me the fucking truth.

433
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,100
Alex, what's happened to you?

434
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,200
I don't think I know who you are any more.

435
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:28,600
- Taylor, I mean, he's...
- Taylor? Taylor what?

436
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:30,300
The things he was saying. He made me do it.

437
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:31,900
- He didn't make you do anything.
- He did make me do...

438
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:33,900
I'm your boyfriend.
Why aren't you listening to me?

439
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:39,000
Do you think all this shit
has just happened by chance?

440
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:43,400
Why can't you see what he's doing?
He's a liar. He just...

441
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:46,700
He just wants you as one of his cheap fucks.

442
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:48,700
- Just stop, Alex.
- Stop what?

443
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:51,600
- I'm just telling you the fucking truth.
- Please, stop.

444
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:55,600
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

445
00:58:58,200 --> 00:58:59,700
I love you.

446
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:36,000
Listen, Taylor,
Alex and I should move on tomorrow.

447
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,300
We need to work things out.

448
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:51,700
Okay.

449
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:55,800
Anyway, I just... I just wanted to tell you.

450
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:02,400
Okay.

451
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:48,000
Who is it?

452
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:51,500
Can I come in?

453
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:58,100
I got what you asked for from Sofe.

454
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:10,100
What did I ask for?

455
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:13,000
Hi.

456
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:18,700
Listen, I just wanted to say I'm sorry, too.

457
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:24,200
- We haven't really gotten along as well...
- I didn't ask for anything.

458
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:27,500
She said you...

459
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,400
Bus ticket. For you.

460
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:07,200
Alex?

461
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,300
Alex?

462
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:38,400
Taylor?

463
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:37,900
Alex?

464
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,400
- What's up?
- Where are you going?

465
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:57,600
Just gonna head into town. Grab a drink.
What's going on?

466
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:00,600
- Alex is gone.
- Okay. Where?

467
01:04:01,300 --> 01:04:03,900
He just... He sent me a text message.

468
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,800
- Did you call him?
- He won't pick up.

469
01:04:07,100 --> 01:04:08,400
Prick.

470
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:14,200
- He just wants your reaction.
- But he's not in his room.

471
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:18,600
His stuff is gone.
He sent me a text message saying, "Gone. "

472
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:21,600
- Was it "Gone" or "Going"?
- "Going. " It was "Going. "

473
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:24,300
Right. Well, he's probably still there.
Bump into him on the way back.

474
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:27,000
I'll bring him back for you.
Don't worry about it.

475
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:30,900
Alex, call me.

476
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:33,800
Maybe you should wait here.

477
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:36,300
Will you just call me, okay?

478
01:04:39,100 --> 01:04:41,400
I think you should wait here,
just in case he comes back.

479
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:43,800
Can we drive and look for him?

480
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:48,900
Do you think it's better if you just wait?

481
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:54,400
Yeah, I guess. Will you wait with me?

482
01:05:07,300 --> 01:05:09,300
It's Alex.

483
01:05:10,700 --> 01:05:13,000
I'll go check for him outside.

484
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:19,200
Hello? Hello?

485
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:23,800
Speak to me.

486
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:30,200
Do you know what?
I don't want it to end like this.

487
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:31,600
Alex?

488
01:05:35,100 --> 01:05:37,400
I've had enough of this, Alex.

489
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:51,700
Nothing. Not out there.

490
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:08,500
Where are you gonna go to next?

491
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:17,300
I don't know.

492
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:22,500
Wherever you want.

493
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:26,100
I think I should go back to Sydney tomorrow.

494
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:29,200
Maybe go home.

495
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:36,100
Will you take me to the nearest place?

496
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:42,600
Okay.

497
01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:27,600
We should be there
in about two and a half hours.

498
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:33,900
Shit.

499
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:39,000
Sorry, my eyes are just closing.

500
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:45,300
I think we should stop, just for a little bit.
Is that okay?

501
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:47,800
Yeah. I guess so.

502
01:08:32,700 --> 01:08:34,000
Sofe.

503
01:08:42,900 --> 01:08:45,200
I'm sorry all this happened.

504
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:56,100
Listen, it'll be okay, all right.

505
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:58,900
And you'll be okay.

506
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:02,700
Things will work out.

507
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:14,300
Thank you.

508
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:33,600
Taylor.

509
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:38,200
Taylor.

510
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Sofe?

511
01:13:23,300 --> 01:13:24,600
Sophie?

512
01:13:31,300 --> 01:13:33,200
Are you there?

513
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:36,200
Yeah, I'm here.

514
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:40,600
What's up?

515
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:45,200
I was cold. I was

516
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:46,500
shivering.

517
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:50,800
Come here, I'll warm you up.

518
01:14:00,700 --> 01:14:02,200
Come here.

519
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:16,100
It doesn't work unless you're touching.

520
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:53,800
Sofe.

521
01:15:04,100 --> 01:15:06,100
Ingrid texted me.

522
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:11,200
Must have been while we were sleeping.

523
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:14,900
She's on her way to Katherine Gorge.

524
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:18,000
I thought...
I thought maybe we could meet her there.

525
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:08,200
You know, we should talk.

526
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:11,100
Sophie, you should tell me.

527
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:13,700
You know, you should talk to me

528
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,500
and you should tell me if something's wrong.

529
01:16:18,900 --> 01:16:20,100
Sophie.

530
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:22,000
Hey, hey, come here.

531
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:24,700
Listen, listen, listen, Sofe. Stop here.

532
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:28,600
Ingrid never texted you last night.

533
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,800
Ingrid doesn't have a phone.
Come here. Sophie!

534
01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:35,200
Fuck!

535
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:37,900
Sophie!

536
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:50,600
Where's Alex?

537
01:16:56,500 --> 01:16:58,700
Why do you have his phone?

538
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:03,600
Sofe.

539
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:08,100
Come on. Don't be ridiculous.

540
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:11,300
Where is he?

541
01:17:16,300 --> 01:17:19,900
- What the fuck have you done to Alex?
- Don't ask me that!

542
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:23,000
Don't ask me that.

543
01:17:24,900 --> 01:17:28,500
Instead, ask what he did to you that night.

544
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:32,700
That has nothing to do with you.

545
01:17:33,300 --> 01:17:34,500
No.

546
01:18:16,700 --> 01:18:18,200
Open up.

547
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:21,400
Unlock it. Unlock it!

548
01:18:54,300 --> 01:18:55,900
I'm sorry.

549
01:19:06,100 --> 01:19:07,600
Neutral.

550
01:19:09,900 --> 01:19:12,000
Start it in neutral.

551
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:22,100
Easy, easy. You're gonna stall again.
Good girl.

552
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:15,100
Where we headed? Where we going?
We going into town?

553
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:18,000
Not sure we got enough fuel for that.

554
01:20:43,300 --> 01:20:44,300
Fuck!

555
01:20:53,500 --> 01:20:56,300
- You wanted me.
- No, I didn't!

556
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:57,400
That's not true.

557
01:20:58,800 --> 01:20:59,800
Come on!

558
01:20:59,900 --> 01:21:02,600
Listen. You have to listen.
You have to listen.

559
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:07,100
Alex attacked me. He attacked me
because he found out about us.

560
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:10,100
There is no "us"!

561
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:42,600
What are you... What are you doing?

562
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:47,300
No!

563
01:21:47,500 --> 01:21:48,600
Stop it.

564
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:50,200
No! God!

565
01:21:53,300 --> 01:21:54,800
No!

566
01:21:55,800 --> 01:22:05,800
