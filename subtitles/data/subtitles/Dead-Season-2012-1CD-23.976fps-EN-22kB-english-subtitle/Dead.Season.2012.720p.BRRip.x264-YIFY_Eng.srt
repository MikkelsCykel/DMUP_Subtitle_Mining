00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:07,906
"DEAD SEASON"

2
00:01:12,281 --> 00:01:15,831
It was 57 weeks ago.
Got a standard cardiac arrest call.

3
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:19,956
I went out... couldn't revive the guy.

4
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:21,381
Pretty normal.

5
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:31,301
Then after a couple of minutes...
That's when it all started.

6
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:37,523
Three days later Pittsburgh was
on lockdown. Then the state,

7
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:38,982
and everywhere else.

8
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:53,159
A couple of months before all this,
my wife, she left me. She got the kid.

9
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,287
I had no way of contacting them.

10
00:01:56,366 --> 00:02:00,416
There were no phones or internet of
course... So I went out to find them...

11
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:14,226
I buried them.

12
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:28,240
I just kept walking... 62 days,

13
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:31,364
I didn't really know what else to do,
you know?

14
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:34,909
Anyway... A guy I used to work with

15
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:38,830
retired to coral cove in Miami.
It's a small marina.

16
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:42,459
I contacted him a few days ago and
I guess he's made a living

17
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:45,461
helping people get boats
and escape into the waters.

18
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:48,085
And I figured, hey, why not try
my hand at that?

19
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:50,137
You're free to join.

20
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:56,264
Elvis? Elvis? You still there?

21
00:02:56,718 --> 00:03:01,269
Yeah, I'm Here. Sorry about that.
So what about you?

22
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:09,316
About the same as yours, I guess.
Been on my own about a year now.

23
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:12,822
Two months ago I met this kid,

24
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:14,570
and we worked our way down to Florida.

25
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:15,617
Who's the kid?

26
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:21,168
His name's Cody. He's pretty quiet,
but he's a tough little dude.

27
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:25,122
Look, I don't know how much longer
we're gonna last here on our own.

28
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,003
You know, just the two of us.

29
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,213
I could always use some company.

30
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,963
Probably be working
our way down south soon.

31
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,258
Maybe we'll stop by your place
for a beer or something.

32
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:39,307
Alright, but you're gonna have to
pick some up, cause I'm all out.

33
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:42,185
Need anything else at the store?

34
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:48,938
Some whiskey? You have my address.
Any chance I can get your name?

35
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:55,610
Guess Not.

36
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:56,652
Stop!

37
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:04,077
Didn't mean to scare you.
Here, eat this.

38
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:06,992
I'm not hungry.

39
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:08,960
Huh? Alright.

40
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:13,332
Here you go Buddy. Lean up.

41
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:19,179
My name's Elvis.
What's your name?

42
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:21,423
Tweeter.

43
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:22,640
Tweeter?

44
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:32,977
OK. Tweeter... So how old are you?

45
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:34,360
Ten.

46
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:39,492
Well, that's cool.
Well, if you want, umm, you two can rest...

47
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:41,531
I've got more blankets in the closet.

48
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:47,658
King Me.

49
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:54,040
You are good at this! You know...
I didn't have any parents growing up either.

50
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,964
I used to get really lonely.

51
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:03,344
I don't feel that way anymore.

52
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,352
My turn?

53
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:09,604
Yeah.

54
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:17,063
Elvis? You there? Elvis!

55
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:18,860
I'm here!

56
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:22,822
Well, your boat's ready to go.
It's got a full tank too.

57
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,196
Thanks, I really appreciate this.

58
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,666
Just to let you know,
I got a list of people waiting.

59
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:31,535
I'll be there tonight with everything.

60
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,753
Alright, see y a then.

61
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:34,712
Thanks.

62
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,467
How far away is this guy?

63
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:43,388
I dunno... six hours,
eight hours... Half a day maybe.

64
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:45,765
You trust him?

65
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:49,887
Yeah, I do trust him.
If he can get us to a place without

66
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:55,648
walkers... I'm willing to take
that risk. Coming? Or staying?

67
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:23,095
Yeah? Who is it?

68
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:24,129
Elvis.

69
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,765
Elvis? Who are they?

70
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:33,809
They're fine. They're friends.
Still good?

71
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:38,477
Yeah... Come on in. - Oh, man!

72
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:45,613
Haven't had those in a while. Yum!

73
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,745
The only way out
is down through the warehouse.

74
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:58,714
Sabrina Lee. She's at the end
of the pier. Everything else...

75
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:04,341
Is in here.
The map is from the warehouse to the pier.

76
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:06,134
The other is to the island.
The fish are toxic,

77
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:07,551
so ration your food.

78
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:12,970
Don't get surrounded. You'll be fine.

79
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:17,273
You know you might want to consider...
Maybe coming with us.

80
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:20,019
Man, I got too good of a thing
going here.

81
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,228
Alright. Take care.

82
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:38,620
Awesome. We have to go through em'.

83
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:48,005
Just stick with me OK?
You know the drill.

84
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:50,556
C'mon, Cody.

85
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:14,622
Cody!

86
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:39,055
Go!

87
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:58,954
Go!

88
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:23,691
The boat!

89
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:05,483
Hey, Cody, There's Probably
a bed down there.

90
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:29,757
Damn it!

91
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:44,314
Oh God!? Cody, let me see are you OK?

92
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:03,791
Come here. Come on. Let me see.

93
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:09,797
You're tough.

94
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:13,584
Arrr I gonna turn into one of them?

95
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,429
I'm not gonna let that happen. OK?

96
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:25,813
Hey, Cody?

97
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:30,777
I don't feel good.

98
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:37,234
I know sweetie. What's this?

99
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:42,289
My mom gave it to me.
It's for good luck.

100
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,371
Come here, sweetie.

101
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:02,178
It's time to go Cody.

102
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:12,151
You gotta go, Cody.

103
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:15,401
Elvis?

104
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,483
You gotta let go, Cody.

105
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:20,201
Come here buddy. Come here.

106
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:18,944
You got it?

107
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:25,325
Disgusting.

108
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:27,199
You alright?

109
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:19,004
You alright?

110
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:48,757
Tweeter?

111
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:15,951
Yes.

112
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:18,286
Alcoholic.

113
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:20,118
Hey, I'm on vacation. hey y a know...

114
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:23,000
See if you can find any of those
silly straws, or those little umbrellas.

115
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:28,259
I'm gonna go check the back for food. Watch my back.

116
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:31,838
I'm watching your back...
and you're good.

117
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:49,780
Elvis!

118
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:00,999
Tweeter!

119
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:11,256
Where are the weapons?!

120
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:12,424
On the table!

121
00:20:18,092 --> 00:20:20,845
Get on the bar! Get on the bar!

122
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,393
Grab the machete!

123
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:36,239
Away!

124
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,115
Elvis get down!

125
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:45,999
This side's clear!

126
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:47,629
Over here too.

127
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:49,999
Up on your feet! Nice and slow!

128
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:53,044
Put your gun on the counter, sir.

129
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:55,130
Turn around, hands on the counter!

130
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,439
Wakey, wakey. Eggs and Bakey.

131
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:54,109
The good news is you're both alive,
which means you're not bit.

132
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:58,572
So now I'm going to ask
a couple questions.

133
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:01,487
Ladies first. Name!

134
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,201
Name!

135
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,794
Want to play the bitch card... Fine.

136
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,297
Hey! Wait.

137
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:29,189
Put her in three twelve.

138
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:41,285
Good Evening

139
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:48,372
My name is Kurt Conrad.
I am the administrator of this facility.

140
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:51,496
Up front I want to apologize
for any bumps or bruises,

141
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,918
I think you can understand our need
for security... and

142
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:56,709
my need to ask you some questions.

143
00:22:57,209 --> 00:23:00,839
So... Let's start with...
how you got here?

144
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:10,731
What exactly do you hope to achieve...
by not talking to me?

145
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:15,778
You think you're going to gain
some power over this situation?

146
00:23:16,687 --> 00:23:19,531
My daughter pulls that shit.
She's seventeen.

147
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:23,528
Is that what you're doing?

148
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,950
Are you pouting like a teenage girl
about the end of the world?

149
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,327
World still here.

150
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:32,788
Let's try it again, something simple.
What's your name?

151
00:23:34,705 --> 00:23:35,752
Elvis.

152
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:38,000
Where you from, Elvis?

153
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:42,296
Nashville, Tennessee.
By way of Tupelo, Mississippi.

154
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:46,141
I kind of lost my accent
along the way.

155
00:23:47,468 --> 00:23:52,395
I was good... wore a cape...
sold out a lot of concerts.

156
00:23:53,307 --> 00:23:56,277
It was insane, man.

157
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,943
Well the state of Pennsylvania says

158
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:02,863
that your name is Aaron Strawbridge.

159
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:09,615
They also say that you are
a highly qualified E.M.T.

160
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:11,700
You're a medic.

161
00:24:22,503 --> 00:24:31,560
I guess this was your wife.
And that was your son.

162
00:24:33,097 --> 00:24:35,725
And by the fact that they are not here

163
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:38,899
I assume they didn't make it.

164
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:53,535
We are the last surviving
human community, on this island.

165
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:57,246
Our survival is held in a very
delicate balance.

166
00:24:57,371 --> 00:24:59,920
It's my job to maintain that balance.

167
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,797
So it falls on me to determine,

168
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:06,388
if and how, you can be
of benefit to us.

169
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:09,216
Now in your case it is very simple.

170
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:16,979
You're a medic. We just lost
our medic. But, your lady friend.

171
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:20,102
I'm not sure what she brings
to the table.

172
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:21,649
All we know about her so far,

173
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:25,365
is that she has a loud mouth,
and she's quite unpleasant.

174
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:28,364
Two qualities we don't really need.

175
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:32,995
Look, my priority is

176
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:37,203
keeping myself and loud mouth
as you call her safe.

177
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:43,087
Leave her alone and I'll see
what I can do, OK?

178
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:50,224
Are you Aaron... or you Elvis?

179
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:54,811
I'm Elvis, man.
But you can call me "King" if you want.

180
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,729
Okay Elvis. See you in the morning.

181
00:26:14,198 --> 00:26:15,040
Come on.

182
00:26:17,451 --> 00:26:19,328
What are your neighbors like?

183
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:29,801
Pretty nice, right? We're trying
to do more than just survive here.

184
00:26:30,214 --> 00:26:31,056
Come on.

185
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:38,602
And there's the beach you came in on,
goes from east to west.

186
00:26:39,056 --> 00:26:43,357
Those structures up there
are all death traps. Avoid those at all costs.

187
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:47,906
We have a solar panel,
got electricity, but not much to use with it.

188
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:52,115
We collect rain water
from all around the compound,

189
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:57,416
and we purify it, and we store it...
in thanks tanks in the hill.

190
00:26:57,533 --> 00:26:59,956
This infrastructure is all courtesy
of the U.S. Navy.

191
00:27:00,077 --> 00:27:02,125
Before that it was a gunnery range.

192
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:04,081
Dropped all kinds of nasty shit here.

193
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:07,301
Depleted uranium, phosphorus,
tested nukes here.

194
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:10,216
And that's the down side,
because most of the stuff that grows here you can't eat it.

195
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:12,431
I mean don't even think about
eating the coconuts.

196
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:13,800
Get the problem?

197
00:27:13,924 --> 00:27:15,926
See, that's the thing, we have
a limited ability to feed people.

198
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:19,312
Which is why we have to go through
this screening process,

199
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:22,771
before we bring in new members
of the community.

200
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:26,145
So what happens if they don't pass
the screening process?

201
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:29,064
We cross that bridge
when we get to it.

202
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,618
So how many are you now?

203
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:35,112
Ah, there's sixteen of us.

204
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:41,829
Jason. Now we were walker free
in this island,

205
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:44,163
since a few months ago
when a Dutch cruise ship

206
00:27:44,288 --> 00:27:45,881
crashed right off the coast there.

207
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:48,462
Since then all kinds of things
have been washing to shore.

208
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:54,386
Booze, supplies, Walkers.
So we sweep the beach daily to salvage what we can.

209
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:58,389
Kill what we need to.
This is our life,

210
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:00,721
if you want to be part of it,
pitch in where you can.

211
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:03,691
Work hard, and ahh,
just don't be afraid to get your hands dirty.

212
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,602
Hey, how about a cold beer?

213
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:09,480
You've got cold beer?

214
00:28:10,731 --> 00:28:14,702
Umm... Ah here we go. It's delicious.

215
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:16,537
Please, help yourself.

216
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:18,075
What is it? Jerky?

217
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:19,699
Cargo from the Dutch.

218
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:22,034
Bet it's been a while
since you've had some meat, huh?

219
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:24,165
Say more than a while.
Been a long time.

220
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:27,331
So, how did you two meet?

221
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:29,507
Wanna tell him?

222
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:32,507
I'm sure it's quite a story.

223
00:28:33,003 --> 00:28:35,347
Where ever you came from,
it's a long ride.

224
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:37,182
Yeah. I used to babysit her.

225
00:28:50,187 --> 00:28:52,861
So light bulbs are scarce,

226
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:54,821
so please be resourceful.

227
00:28:55,317 --> 00:28:56,944
And, uh, no hot water.
It's broken at the moment,

228
00:28:57,027 --> 00:28:59,155
but tomorrow morning
I'm gonna try and fix it.

229
00:28:59,154 --> 00:28:59,996
Thanks

230
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:02,291
Yeah, try to get some rest,
busy day tomorrow.

231
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:04,835
Good night all.
- Goodnight... Timberlake.

232
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:09,964
Kurt.

233
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:11,754
What about him?

234
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:13,134
You tell me.

235
00:29:13,627 --> 00:29:15,629
He's crazy. Watch him.

236
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:18,431
Sanz. Cigar Castro dude.

237
00:29:18,966 --> 00:29:20,058
Whatever.

238
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:22,177
Ignore. Alex?

239
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:24,179
He's just a dumb kid.

240
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:30,277
Yeah but he's cute. Tommy?
Balding, tribal Tattoo.

241
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:32,104
Watch.

242
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:41,580
Here's the compound. This gate
is basically the only way in.

243
00:29:41,655 --> 00:29:45,626
Keeps the Walkers out. This barricade
separates us from the rest of the island.

244
00:29:46,243 --> 00:29:49,292
Conrad believes that your boat
is here on this beach.

245
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:52,378
Did you pass a pier, when you came in,
a lot of Walkers?

246
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:53,591
I don't know.

247
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:56,378
How about there's a brick saw mill,
did you go through there?

248
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:57,755
Yeah, we went right through it.

249
00:29:57,879 --> 00:30:00,098
Alright, and then after that
did you go over a road?

250
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:00,969
Yeah.

251
00:30:01,091 --> 00:30:02,559
If you curved this way,

252
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:04,307
your boat could be on this beach.

253
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:08,186
Anyone! Is anyone out there?

254
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:10,726
Please identify your location.

255
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:14,439
The military base... just outside London.

256
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:18,070
The Walkers are running.
I don't know why

257
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:21,821
but they die, they get up, and they-

258
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:23,288
Running... you serious?

259
00:30:24,281 --> 00:30:28,878
Listen, we need a way
to evacuate immediately! Seriously!

260
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:31,875
Hello?

261
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:37,424
Todd. Take these two over
to North Beach, look for the boat.

262
00:30:39,463 --> 00:30:40,885
Uh... Fine gimme a second.

263
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:46,561
Sure this is the right beach?

264
00:30:47,721 --> 00:30:49,769
Yeah. - Bullshit, man!

265
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:51,563
Hey, I don't know what to tell y a.

266
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:02,452
This your idea of entertainment?

267
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:05,038
Like life before the internet.
- And TV.

268
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,873
Or life after the internet and TV.

269
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,288
Can the chatter. We do this because
it's important.

270
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:11,662
Our lives are important. Watch... See.

271
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:14,915
It's slow!

272
00:31:15,499 --> 00:31:19,504
You keep active and move,
you're going to be alright.

273
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,887
Toss the bat.

274
00:31:22,089 --> 00:31:27,391
Now, I don't care what it is.
Machete, Bat, wrench.

275
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:30,481
Use it to create separation.
I protect myself.

276
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:32,975
I can evade. I can leave!

277
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:38,110
Now. If you want to have a strike
evasion, use the technique,

278
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,482
step to the side...

279
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:42,947
Try to hit right between
the fourth and fifth vertebrate.

280
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:46,993
Snap the the neck in half.
That's a good day. Alright, who's up?

281
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:50,204
You! Lets go.

282
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:53,453
No thanks.

283
00:32:00,377 --> 00:32:04,098
Alright. Why the fuck don't
you do that?

284
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:10,896
Nice job back there. Showed some skill I'm impressed.

285
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:14,562
Why because I'm a chick? Sorry to say, I don't fit the

286
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:16,314
normal female mold around here.

287
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:21,032
Look, for this to work, everyone has
to contribute and be effective at it.

288
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:25,407
These women are very effective
in their roles.

289
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:31,163
With the male to female ratio
being four to one, they're greatly valued.

290
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:33,994
What is this, some weird Mormon thing?

291
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:36,580
It's the exact opposite.
Look I'm going to ask you two,

292
00:32:36,705 --> 00:32:38,548
to reserve your judgment

293
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:41,009
until you are more deeply integrated
into the community.

294
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:42,006
Colonel! - What's up?

295
00:32:42,294 --> 00:32:44,342
It's Rachel. I think she's sick.

296
00:32:46,006 --> 00:32:48,134
Is she sick, or is she in a mood?

297
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:49,138
I don't know sir.

298
00:32:54,598 --> 00:32:55,815
Rachel. Rachel.

299
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:58,393
This is Elvis, he's your new doctor.

300
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:00,611
Hi Rachel.

301
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:03,278
She fainted. Prior to that
she was delusional.

302
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:05,700
You a real doctor?

303
00:33:06,193 --> 00:33:07,410
Yeah, something like that.

304
00:33:08,195 --> 00:33:09,287
I'm fine.

305
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:12,908
No sweetie... no you're not fine.
She doesn't eat.

306
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:15,119
What's your normal diet consist of?

307
00:33:15,202 --> 00:33:18,206
The island diet is primarily meat.
And she doesn't want to eat meat.

308
00:33:18,288 --> 00:33:20,131
It's just, you know, a phase.

309
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:21,841
A phase? - Yeah it's a phase,
You are going through.

310
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:23,919
Well maybe if you gave me some real
food then I'd eat.

311
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,675
Rachel, can I run a few tests on y a?

312
00:33:26,463 --> 00:33:27,635
Let's put this down here.

313
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:33,015
Here we go... alright.
Can you look at me?

314
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:40,186
Look to your right. Look to your left.
Close your eyes, and open your eyes... good.

315
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:43,275
Squeeze my two fingers for
a five count, as hard as you can. Ready?

316
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:48,152
Go. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Good.

317
00:33:48,235 --> 00:33:49,908
You play any sports or anything?

318
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,415
Yeah it's called stay in my room
all day and stare at the wall,

319
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:54,579
it's fucking awesome.

320
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:56,293
Seriously, do you get out?

321
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:00,376
No.

322
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:07,638
Look, if I had my gear I could do
some other tests. As far as I can tell

323
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:09,347
she's healthy. Ok.

324
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:11,891
I mean physically,
but she does need to eat more.

325
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:12,975
Yeah.

326
00:34:13,635 --> 00:34:15,103
How long has she been in this room?

327
00:34:15,262 --> 00:34:16,309
Ten months.

328
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,978
Ten months? - Yeah!

329
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,734
Like has not left this room
in ten months?

330
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:27,783
Listen to me. She is not ready
for what's out there.

331
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:30,694
Come on, you got eyes.

332
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:34,031
Okay... she's confused,
she has cabin fever,

333
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:36,123
and she probably needs
somebody to talk to.

334
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:37,333
She's got me to talk to.

335
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:40,875
Someone else.
Okay, I mean when was the last time

336
00:34:40,954 --> 00:34:42,547
she had a conversation
with another woman?

337
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:45,629
It's been awhile.

338
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:49,137
Everyday, it's something different
with her.

339
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:52,474
Could you just go in,
and just talk to her?

340
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:55,935
What am I supposed to say?

341
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:59,807
Whatever girls talk about.
Just... you know...

342
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:07,985
Let her in.

343
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:15,534
I'm Tweeter.

344
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:21,415
You're Rachel? How old are you?

345
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:26,463
Seventeen. What kind of name
is Tweeter?

346
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:29,427
What, that's my name.

347
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:31,925
Your parents named you "Tweeter"?

348
00:35:33,757 --> 00:35:36,010
Well... No... it's...

349
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,886
Oh. So you made it up.

350
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:40,601
Look, I'm not here to talk about
me okay?

351
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:43,392
They said you needed
someone to talk to.

352
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:47,942
I just want to go outside!
He thinks I'll die,

353
00:35:48,021 --> 00:35:51,776
or get raped or something.
- So... when you do go out...

354
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:53,952
No! I don't go outside.

355
00:35:54,027 --> 00:35:56,200
He doesn't let me leave! Ever!

356
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:06,123
Are there any other girls
here your age?

357
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:09,467
Just you and those whores.

358
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:16,508
I had a sister though...

359
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:19,723
And a mom...

360
00:36:22,472 --> 00:36:25,351
Do me a favor and tell my dad
it's girl stuff or something.

361
00:36:26,476 --> 00:36:27,398
Yeah, OK.

362
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:33,445
Who the hell does he think he is?

363
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:35,694
Yeah, who the hell does he think
he is?

364
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:38,413
Seriously, we were fine without them.

365
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:41,458
Really? We've been living off of
gas station food.

366
00:36:42,075 --> 00:36:43,998
Potato Chips... Canned Ham...

367
00:36:44,661 --> 00:36:47,289
Fuck there was a week I had
to survive off of dog biscuits.

368
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:52,802
Look, it's not that bad. We're safer.
Bigger numbers.

369
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:56,764
I mean, doesn't anything make you
happy?

370
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:58,383
Hey, I dunno, what makes you smile?

371
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:01,561
OF course stuff makes me happy.

372
00:37:01,678 --> 00:37:04,227
Well tell me! I don't know
anything about you. I don't know your name...

373
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:06,933
I know this is kinda third grade but
do you have a favorite color?

374
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:09,027
You know, I'm gonna guess that
it's red.

375
00:37:09,102 --> 00:37:09,819
Nope.

376
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:11,279
Do you have a favorite food?

377
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:15,026
We'll start there.
What's your favorite food?

378
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:20,159
Hot dogs and pancakes.

379
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,533
That's all you came up with?

380
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:26,836
Hot dogs and pancakes?
So its hot dogs with pancake buns?

381
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:28,751
Nooo! Gross!

382
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:32,588
Today's a straight up S and D.
We're putting them in the mix.

383
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:35,428
So, Mike you're on point.
Alex, you got the rear.

384
00:37:35,545 --> 00:37:38,139
Todd, You're in the middle with them.
Teach them what you know.

385
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:39,340
Tweeter sandwich.

386
00:37:39,466 --> 00:37:42,219
Stow it, she's weapons and
re-con now. Treat her as such.

387
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:43,970
You each get three rounds...

388
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:46,268
These are to be used only
as a last resort.

389
00:37:47,766 --> 00:37:51,441
Alright. You will insert
on the east end of the beach. Sweep west,

390
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:54,363
keep the sun at your back.
Use your heads.

391
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:59,536
No mistakes. No drama. No heroes.
Come back safe.

392
00:38:01,196 --> 00:38:04,826
Hand me that gun, Backstreet.
Yeah, you like it.

393
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:09,337
Yeah, the coconuts are pretty much
gone, the Mangos are gone,

394
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:10,834
most of the shit's rotten.

395
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,172
Soaked in radiation.

396
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:14,000
And the only thing worse than
the fucking food...

397
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,468
Is these god damn bugs.

398
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:18,046
A bag of marshmallows
washed up about a week or two ago,

399
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,802
shit, but that's about it.

400
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,183
Flotsem and Jetsum!

401
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,898
Hey Tweeter, you still off limits?

402
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:34,521
Fucking disgusting, man.

403
00:38:34,604 --> 00:38:37,323
Hey! Over here! - Hey guys, c'mon.

404
00:38:37,774 --> 00:38:41,529
I need help! Come on! Help!

405
00:38:42,904 --> 00:38:44,156
Are you bitten?

406
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,499
No I'm not. It's my wife.
She's broken her leg.

407
00:38:46,616 --> 00:38:47,868
She's over here.

408
00:38:47,951 --> 00:38:49,419
Okay.

409
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:51,879
Slowly.

410
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:53,586
Come on.

411
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:56,710
We first got here and,
we were sent here from Miami. We were told

412
00:38:56,793 --> 00:38:59,137
this island was walker free.
We first got here and...

413
00:38:59,629 --> 00:39:01,973
Stop! Keep walking.

414
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,892
Keep coming.

415
00:39:09,556 --> 00:39:13,356
Help! Help, I'm down here.

416
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:16,609
This is completely against
everything Kurt's told us.

417
00:39:17,105 --> 00:39:18,152
We're going back.

418
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:19,650
Get out of my way.

419
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:21,359
Where are you going?
You going with her? That noob?

420
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:23,285
Yeah, I'm going with that noob.

421
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:27,198
<i>L 90'! post.</i>

422
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:31,877
Are you bit?

423
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:33,955
No. - She's lying.

424
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:36,962
She's not bit. OK?
Put the gun down, It's not necessary.

425
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:38,884
Put the gun away. Put the gun away!

426
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:39,961
My husband.

427
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:42,555
He's up there and he's safe.
We're gonna get you out of here OK?

428
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:43,639
You got any water?

429
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:46,384
I need you to cut down some branches
and we're gonna have to splint this OK?

430
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:48,014
What's your name? - Emily.

431
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:50,855
Hey, drink some water.
Just a little bit of water. A little water.

432
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,858
I'm gonna straighten out your leg
a little bit. It's gonna hurt.

433
00:39:54,309 --> 00:39:54,980
Okay.

434
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:56,353
Just a little bit. It's OK.

435
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:57,979
I know it hurts. I know it hurts.

436
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:05,074
We've got walkers!

437
00:40:10,033 --> 00:40:11,034
Shit!

438
00:40:11,701 --> 00:40:14,295
We gotta go! Up, up, up, UP!

439
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:16,126
Behind you!

440
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:21,093
Fuck.

441
00:40:21,336 --> 00:40:22,508
Fuck!

442
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,381
Emily, come on.

443
00:40:25,924 --> 00:40:26,800
Shit!

444
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:28,893
Take her!

445
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:38,110
Take her!

446
00:40:38,728 --> 00:40:40,321
You fucking shot me, Alex!

447
00:41:04,087 --> 00:41:05,430
One, two, three, up!

448
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:09,016
Go, go! Go, run! Get up! Go, get up!
Move it!

449
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:16,729
Keep up!

450
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:18,271
Where were you?

451
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:21,437
Some more steps!

452
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:23,314
Get in!

453
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:25,359
This way, this way.

454
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:29,366
Stay with me, stay with me.

455
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:32,039
Where's the blood bank?
- The fridge!

456
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:33,742
Take off his bandage,
take off his bandage.

457
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:36,911
What's your blood type?
- A-negative.

458
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:38,588
A-negative, alright.

459
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:42,584
Get her some water,
we're probably gonna have to amputate okay?

460
00:41:43,084 --> 00:41:44,210
Get her some water!

461
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:50,680
B-positive... Nothing!
There's nothing here!

462
00:41:50,675 --> 00:41:52,177
Elvis! I'm O-negative.

463
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:55,180
Sit down, that'll work.
You're universal. Gimmie your arm.

464
00:41:57,807 --> 00:41:58,933
AW shit.

465
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:02,070
It was quick man. Honestly, I'm alright, I'm alright.

466
00:42:04,105 --> 00:42:06,608
I'm O-negative. - Perfect, sit down.

467
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:11,033
Hey, look up, look up. Count backwards from 100. Okay?

468
00:42:11,112 --> 00:42:12,489
Okay? Lemme hear you. Start counting.

469
00:42:12,572 --> 00:42:15,951
100, 99, 98,

470
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:20,039
97, 96, 95,

471
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:24,551
94, 93, 92...

472
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:28,221
Ow Shit! - Walker!

473
00:42:29,005 --> 00:42:30,131
Aw fuck!

474
00:42:39,849 --> 00:42:43,854
We go over this, everyday.
You keep your distance.

475
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:47,949
They can't hurt you unless
you let them get close!

476
00:42:48,066 --> 00:42:51,366
What idiot thought it was
a good idea to go into the jungle

477
00:42:51,486 --> 00:42:53,614
with one way out.

478
00:42:54,322 --> 00:42:56,120
Huh? Whose idea was that?

479
00:43:01,204 --> 00:43:02,330
It was me, sir.

480
00:43:06,084 --> 00:43:08,803
You walked 'em into a deathtrap.

481
00:43:12,173 --> 00:43:13,595
How is he?

482
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:17,721
He's fine. Well, he'll live.

483
00:43:17,804 --> 00:43:19,181
What about our guest?

484
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:20,355
Quarantine.

485
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:25,107
You just traded two of my best men
for a worthless old fuck.

486
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:34,830
Sergent Alex Waterman.
He was an army ranger. A damn good one.

487
00:43:37,115 --> 00:43:40,289
He served two tours of duty
in the middle east,

488
00:43:40,368 --> 00:43:41,961
and brought his skill set here.

489
00:43:42,537 --> 00:43:46,963
We owe him a lot.
He will be sorely missed.

490
00:43:51,254 --> 00:43:57,387
My grandfather, died in Vietnam
In the jungle. Much like

491
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:01,105
this shithole I'm sure.

492
00:44:05,101 --> 00:44:09,197
My father, John Waterman...

493
00:44:13,526 --> 00:44:15,949
Took direct RPG hits in Kuwait.

494
00:44:23,411 --> 00:44:25,163
And I'm proud to follow them.

495
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:40,436
Keep her close.

496
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:20,547
Ok doc... So into the camera.

497
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:22,014
Why is this going to work?

498
00:47:23,049 --> 00:47:27,976
Well, the bites don't cause
this phenomenon, but they do kill.

499
00:47:28,054 --> 00:47:30,773
And as soon as they do,
they come back.

500
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:32,646
Now I think it may be bacterial.

501
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:34,818
My dad's bit, this is our only shot.
Just hurry up

502
00:47:34,894 --> 00:47:36,191
and do it.

503
00:47:36,312 --> 00:47:37,689
If we had more time,

504
00:47:37,772 --> 00:47:40,275
what we'd do is we'd locate all
the major blood vessles,

505
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:43,778
tie them individually,
and normally we'd use a bone saw-

506
00:47:46,322 --> 00:47:51,874
Despite some complications,
the amputation was successful.

507
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:55,248
Unfortunately,
whatever toxins are in the bite,

508
00:47:55,331 --> 00:47:59,211
once they get into the bloodstream,
it's already too late.

509
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:01,678
Okay, work quickly.

510
00:48:01,754 --> 00:48:04,507
Get as much of the body as you can,
and you might net 50 pounds per procedure.

511
00:48:05,341 --> 00:48:07,218
I can't quite say

512
00:48:07,385 --> 00:48:14,519
what would happen over long term
consumption, or what would happen

513
00:48:14,642 --> 00:48:17,646
if someone eats this contaminated
meat and turns into one of them.

514
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:19,317
They seem to be getting
more agressive.

515
00:48:21,482 --> 00:48:23,860
Eventually we're all gonna turn.

516
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:27,238
I need to step outside.

517
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:29,244
Oh no no no! You stay right here...

518
00:48:38,207 --> 00:48:42,178
Okay, so we're here,
here's Costa Rica.

519
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:45,549
It's basically due South.

520
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:48,384
Now, how do you find due South
in the southern hemosphere?

521
00:48:50,219 --> 00:48:53,519
Southern cross. Right?
Tip of the Southern cross that's due south.

522
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:57,727
Okay. So... these are your turn points.

523
00:48:58,185 --> 00:49:00,529
Duration of your tac is 70 miles.

524
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:02,982
How do you determine
your speed at sea?

525
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:05,784
Drop the buoy and measure
the knot over time.

526
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:07,328
That's why it's called a knot.

527
00:49:07,445 --> 00:49:09,698
See? Simple as that. It's brilliant.

528
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:14,710
You're mom was a hell of a navigator. You're just like her.

529
00:49:17,872 --> 00:49:20,091
Come on. Talk to me.

530
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:21,550
Talk to you about what?

531
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:23,468
Anything. How was your day?

532
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:26,968
It was awful. Same as always.
Over and over

533
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:29,968
and over.

534
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:33,642
I get it. I get it. I just need
you to be patient with me.

535
00:49:33,721 --> 00:49:35,689
Now your mom and I had a plan.

536
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:38,400
Mom? You wanna talk about mom?
Let's talk about her.

537
00:49:40,144 --> 00:49:43,148
Do you wanna talk about Stacy?
We can talk about her too.

538
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:46,362
We'll finish this later.

539
00:50:10,466 --> 00:50:14,642
I want you to look at each other.
Good look.

540
00:50:15,221 --> 00:50:17,223
One, or all of us,

541
00:50:17,306 --> 00:50:18,979
will not be here in a month.

542
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:21,022
It's taken less than twelve months
of this infection

543
00:50:21,101 --> 00:50:24,571
to wipe out the population of
this planet, and reduce us to this.

544
00:50:24,647 --> 00:50:27,321
But yet, you treat your survival
with an astonishing

545
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:31,199
lack or urgency. You're lazy,
you're sloppy,

546
00:50:31,362 --> 00:50:34,832
and unbelievably, you're fat.
How does that happen?

547
00:50:35,574 --> 00:50:38,669
It's a lack of discipline...
and that's my fault.

548
00:50:38,786 --> 00:50:41,209
If any one of you has lost
confidence in me,

549
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:45,964
or thinks he can do a better job
than me, pick up my gun,

550
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:49,255
because things are about to change.

551
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:56,349
All right.

552
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:02,313
Starting today, we will double
our salvage operations.

553
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:05,821
All food stores
will be under lockdown,

554
00:51:05,938 --> 00:51:08,737
and I will ration it as I see fit.

555
00:51:17,366 --> 00:51:20,165
My sister drew that... it's our boat

556
00:51:20,244 --> 00:51:21,541
The one that sank?

557
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:24,999
Can you do something for me?

558
00:51:25,833 --> 00:51:26,709
What is it?

559
00:51:26,834 --> 00:51:28,507
See if it's still there?

560
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:34,183
According to my dad, it sank.

561
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:38,137
Holy shit! Where did you get this?

562
00:51:38,596 --> 00:51:40,598
My dad gives it to me.

563
00:51:40,681 --> 00:51:43,605
I've just been saving it up so
I can get outta here... but I'm obviously stuck here,

564
00:51:43,684 --> 00:51:46,733
so I need you to go check.
I'll draw you a map.

565
00:51:50,983 --> 00:51:54,203
You have to go the long way around
the barricades so you can avoid the guards.

566
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:57,122
Thank you.

567
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:00,705
Bye.

568
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:02,916
Hey Elvis. - Yeah.

569
00:52:02,995 --> 00:52:05,669
Mind taking a ride with me?
I need your opinion on a couple things.

570
00:52:06,248 --> 00:52:07,841
What do you need to talk about?

571
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:11,720
Health issues around the camp.

572
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:13,763
Don't worry about it. He's a big boy, he can take care of himself.

573
00:52:15,215 --> 00:52:17,058
Yeah, sure. You good?

574
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:47,589
How are you doing, Elvis?
You all right?

575
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:53,004
Used to it.

576
00:52:53,087 --> 00:52:55,340
So you think I'm a hard-ass, huh?
Elvis?

577
00:52:56,215 --> 00:53:01,062
A lot of people do. If we do not
strip down to our primal wiring,

578
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:04,060
we're not gonna make it.

579
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:17,578
I had two daughters. And a wife.

580
00:53:18,737 --> 00:53:20,660
A couple months after
we came to shore,

581
00:53:20,823 --> 00:53:25,169
my oldest, Stacie... she got sick.

582
00:53:26,995 --> 00:53:29,623
She was weak from malnutrition.

583
00:53:31,125 --> 00:53:33,219
My wife was in denial about it.

584
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:35,261
She just couldn't wrap her head around

585
00:53:35,337 --> 00:53:37,089
what was happening to her kid.

586
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:39,766
So I let it go.

587
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:48,814
The day she turned, I was on patrol,
and my wife,

588
00:53:50,185 --> 00:53:52,688
she just had to have that last hug.

589
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:55,031
You know, as like it was gonna
fuckin' fix somethin'.

590
00:53:56,191 --> 00:54:01,197
So by the time I got home,
they were both gone. And I had to...

591
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:12,173
You did what you needed to do.

592
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:19,761
Rachel's all the family I got left...

593
00:54:20,591 --> 00:54:22,138
and I'm not gonna let her starve.

594
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:35,898
Good evening, Mr. Vernon.
My name is Kurt Conrad.

595
00:54:36,023 --> 00:54:38,776
I am the administrator
of this facility.

596
00:54:38,901 --> 00:54:40,778
I apologize for the inconvenience

597
00:54:40,861 --> 00:54:43,034
but we need to hold you here until
we are certain you are not infected.

598
00:54:43,614 --> 00:54:47,994
I'm sure you can understand.
Sorry for your loss.

599
00:54:49,328 --> 00:54:50,124
Hey.

600
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:55,376
That's it?
That's all you're going to say?

601
00:54:55,459 --> 00:54:56,802
Look at him.

602
00:54:59,922 --> 00:55:03,267
Of what possible benefit is he to us?

603
00:55:13,435 --> 00:55:16,655
You guys, I should have taught
you how to wrap presents a little better.

604
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:18,232
Yeah we're all ready, right?

605
00:55:18,357 --> 00:55:20,701
Dad, we're almost ready.
Are you ready?

606
00:55:21,485 --> 00:55:25,490
Can I come in yet?

607
00:55:25,572 --> 00:55:26,789
No!

608
00:55:26,949 --> 00:55:28,701
Light the candles!

609
00:55:28,784 --> 00:55:30,661
One second, I get the matches.

610
00:55:32,788 --> 00:55:37,715
What are we doing here?
What are we doing here?

611
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:40,296
I think you know what
we're doing here.

612
00:55:43,841 --> 00:55:46,435
We're here to harvest Mr. Vernon.

613
00:55:49,847 --> 00:55:54,193
Don't pull that shit on me.
I have seen you walk in the darkness.

614
00:55:54,268 --> 00:55:57,863
I know you're comfortable there.
All I'm asking you to do

615
00:55:57,980 --> 00:56:01,530
is shine a light on it and own it.

616
00:56:02,818 --> 00:56:09,246
I know. A lion kills a gazelle.

617
00:56:10,117 --> 00:56:15,590
It appears to be cruel, and heartless.
You follow that lion home.

618
00:56:16,415 --> 00:56:18,543
You're gonna see that all it was doing

619
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:22,008
was feeding its family.
That's all you and I

620
00:56:22,129 --> 00:56:24,177
are doing here!
We're feeding our families!

621
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:26,558
I can't do that.

622
00:56:26,675 --> 00:56:30,145
Yeah, you can. Because you have to.
You're the only one

623
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:32,769
who has the skill! The moment he dies,
he turns!

624
00:56:32,848 --> 00:56:35,192
That means that meat is useless to us!

625
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:40,193
No. Fuck you! Fuck you!!

626
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:47,032
Fuck!!

627
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:55,124
What do you think you're here for?!

628
00:56:57,456 --> 00:56:58,503
Shit.

629
00:56:58,624 --> 00:57:02,879
Elvis, have you not heard
a single word I said?

630
00:57:03,712 --> 00:57:05,760
I lost my wife, I lost my daughter,

631
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:08,433
cuz I didn't do
what needed to be done,

632
00:57:08,508 --> 00:57:10,101
when it needed to be done!!

633
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:19,358
You have got to feed your family.
Tweeter is your Rachel.

634
00:57:20,646 --> 00:57:24,947
They can't do this! We can.

635
00:57:29,196 --> 00:57:34,327
You wanna be a king, Elvis?
You gotta act like one.

636
00:57:57,808 --> 00:58:00,937
Mr. Vernon. You're doing well.
That's a good sign.

637
00:58:01,853 --> 00:58:05,949
Gonna get you out of here.
First I gotta give you a vitamin boosters,

638
00:58:06,024 --> 00:58:08,527
I need you to just turn your head.
Thank you.

639
00:58:09,069 --> 00:58:10,821
Gonna feel a little pinch.

640
00:58:14,366 --> 00:58:18,166
Gotta move fast.
Harvest large to small.

641
00:58:18,245 --> 00:58:22,250
Start with the legs, buttocks,
shoulders then the arms.

642
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,220
Make sure you tie off the arteries,
limit the blood loss.

643
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:27,633
Where're you going?

644
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:33,769
This is a bridge you cross on your own.

645
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:38,974
When you're done,
put the cuts in the saline solution.

646
00:58:39,057 --> 00:58:40,525
Be right outside.

647
00:59:00,746 --> 00:59:01,872
How sad is this?

648
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:02,797
And now?

649
00:59:02,873 --> 00:59:05,217
Are your ready?

650
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:07,210
Calm down!

651
00:59:07,294 --> 00:59:10,639
Just one second. One moment.

652
00:59:10,714 --> 00:59:12,341
It's your birthday.
You're gonna have to... Alright alright.

653
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:14,642
I think it's already ruined, mom.

654
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:17,183
I know but we can still pretend.

655
00:59:17,304 --> 00:59:19,978
Alright, here I come.

656
00:59:20,599 --> 00:59:21,851
Come in.

657
00:59:23,769 --> 00:59:25,066
Alright, ready?

658
00:59:25,187 --> 00:59:28,487
What am I? I wish...

659
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:34,492
Dad you don't look a day of 85.

660
00:59:34,488 --> 00:59:36,240
I have a knife in my hand, okay?

661
00:59:36,323 --> 00:59:38,246
Seriously I have a knife in my hand
and I will do serious damage.

662
00:59:38,325 --> 00:59:40,828
Back of that old man,
this fat old man thing.

663
00:59:40,911 --> 00:59:42,003
Not true!

664
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:45,548
You gotta back off so quickly.
Right baby?

665
00:59:45,665 --> 00:59:46,461
No!

666
00:59:52,005 --> 00:59:54,178
Give it Stay! - Okay.

667
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:57,427
I don't mind.

668
00:59:57,886 --> 01:00:00,560
Happy birthday! - Happy birthday Dad!

669
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:04,485
I want to open presents.

670
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:05,818
Please make quick.

671
01:00:05,894 --> 01:00:07,817
Yeah let's bring 'em
in the living room.

672
01:00:07,938 --> 01:00:09,531
I am happy when you are here.

673
01:00:09,648 --> 01:00:10,774
Happy birthday Dad!

674
01:00:11,566 --> 01:00:13,660
You're the best dad in the world.

675
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:15,612
Really? - You know that.

676
01:00:16,488 --> 01:00:17,284
No come on dad.

677
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,406
I gotta take this, honey.

678
01:00:48,228 --> 01:00:51,323
I wish I could tell you that
it gets harder,

679
01:00:52,899 --> 01:00:53,900
but it doesn't.

680
01:00:55,068 --> 01:00:57,491
Thank you. I got it from here.

681
01:03:02,696 --> 01:03:04,164
What's going on?

682
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:18,713
The more I think about it
the more the man makes sense, you know?

683
01:03:19,546 --> 01:03:21,719
And the more this makes sense for us.

684
01:03:22,882 --> 01:03:26,011
Don't be ridiculous! We're leaving,

685
01:03:26,094 --> 01:03:27,641
and we're taking Rachel with us.

686
01:03:27,721 --> 01:03:31,976
No no no. He's doing what
he has to do, okay? He's doing

687
01:03:32,058 --> 01:03:34,857
what he has to do to keep the people
that he loves alive.

688
01:03:34,936 --> 01:03:37,485
And the people he doesn't
as their food!

689
01:03:37,564 --> 01:03:40,113
There's fucking nothing out there
for us anymore, okay?

690
01:03:40,984 --> 01:03:42,702
This is it!

691
01:03:46,781 --> 01:03:49,079
You think you're going to go
to another island that has food?

692
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:52,621
Another island that has TV dinners?

693
01:03:53,455 --> 01:03:55,082
You don't even have a boat.

694
01:04:02,255 --> 01:04:04,428
This is the first time since
I've met you

695
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:07,181
that I'm scared of something
other than those fucking things.

696
01:04:08,762 --> 01:04:10,730
Don't know if I can trust you anymore.

697
01:04:10,805 --> 01:04:12,273
Don't, don't say that.

698
01:04:56,476 --> 01:04:58,524
If you could sail anywhere
where would you go?

699
01:04:59,229 --> 01:05:00,606
Anywhere away from here.

700
01:05:00,939 --> 01:05:02,657
Let's take the boat and get out
of here.

701
01:05:03,108 --> 01:05:05,076
Think we can sail it just
the two of us?

702
01:05:05,193 --> 01:05:07,241
Yeah, yeah we could figure it out.

703
01:05:08,696 --> 01:05:12,291
I'm gonna start getting shit together.
Hang in there okay?

704
01:06:07,589 --> 01:06:08,215
Hey.

705
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:12,552
What are you doing here?

706
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:18,642
I was taking a hike.
What are you doing?

707
01:06:21,436 --> 01:06:25,987
Huntin' redheads. You know it's kind
of dangerous for you to be hiking

708
01:06:26,065 --> 01:06:28,488
all by yourself.
- Come on let's getback.

709
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:36,664
Stay away from me, you touch me and
I'll scream and alert every fucking walker within a mile.

710
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:39,287
You scream and we both die.

711
01:06:39,913 --> 01:06:42,086
So why don't you just keep your
mouth shut.

712
01:07:11,110 --> 01:07:12,327
Take off your belt!

713
01:07:28,670 --> 01:07:30,138
Fuck!

714
01:07:46,896 --> 01:07:48,239
You bitch!

715
01:08:03,663 --> 01:08:04,710
Don't leave me.

716
01:08:33,401 --> 01:08:34,118
Fuck!

717
01:09:15,276 --> 01:09:17,370
Give me your gun. Give it to me.

718
01:09:18,404 --> 01:09:19,997
Open the gate.

719
01:09:21,741 --> 01:09:27,293
Fucking now! Hurry up! Fuck!
Open the fucking gate!

720
01:09:36,172 --> 01:09:37,173
What's wrong?

721
01:09:37,298 --> 01:09:39,551
They can fucking run now.
We have to go.

722
01:09:39,634 --> 01:09:41,887
Who can run? Calm down, calm down.

723
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:45,311
The fucking walkers.

724
01:09:45,390 --> 01:09:49,395
What happened? Ok? Whose blood
is that?

725
01:09:49,477 --> 01:09:54,324
It's Tommy's. I was at the compound
and he followed me.

726
01:09:54,399 --> 01:09:55,070
Okay.

727
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:59,367
And he said he'd try to... he'd kill
me if I didn't let him... fuck me!

728
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:02,991
I killed him. I killed him,

729
01:10:03,074 --> 01:10:04,826
and he got up and he fucking
started running!

730
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:08,379
What do you want me to do?

731
01:10:10,498 --> 01:10:12,421
I have to get Rachel.
- Okay.

732
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:15,503
There's a boat at the end of the pier,
but Kurt's gonna try to stop us.

733
01:10:15,628 --> 01:10:19,007
I'll talk to Kurt, okay? Listen. Stop.
Calm down.

734
01:10:19,132 --> 01:10:21,976
We'll be fine, okay?
You get Rachel

735
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:24,804
and we'll meet back up, okay?
Okay. Okay, let's go.

736
01:10:32,186 --> 01:10:34,860
Zankou chicken, man that shit is great.

737
01:10:35,898 --> 01:10:39,072
You keep talking about chicken
I'm gonna

738
01:10:39,152 --> 01:10:40,699
shoot you right now.

739
01:10:47,326 --> 01:10:51,126
Walkers broke through the gate.
Hurry up!

740
01:10:52,039 --> 01:10:54,667
Time to get inside. Go, move it!
Movie it!

741
01:11:22,403 --> 01:11:23,325
Oh my god.

742
01:11:24,989 --> 01:11:26,081
Come on out.
- What?

743
01:11:26,199 --> 01:11:27,496
We're talking the boat for a swing.

744
01:11:29,869 --> 01:11:30,791
Right now?

745
01:11:30,912 --> 01:11:33,085
We're leaving the island!

746
01:11:33,164 --> 01:11:34,757
Don't waste time!

747
01:11:36,876 --> 01:11:38,753
Come on, Rachel, let's go! Come on!

748
01:11:50,181 --> 01:11:55,608
All right, Sanz, you come with me.
Stay close, boys!

749
01:12:05,613 --> 01:12:06,660
Okay!

750
01:12:07,907 --> 01:12:08,954
Stay close!

751
01:12:10,910 --> 01:12:12,378
Stay close, boys!

752
01:12:13,704 --> 01:12:15,297
Idiots! Stay here!

753
01:12:17,375 --> 01:12:19,798
Stay close, Mike! Reloading!

754
01:12:22,046 --> 01:12:23,889
To the gate! - Come on!

755
01:12:23,881 --> 01:12:24,928
Fuck!

756
01:12:35,476 --> 01:12:36,443
Move! Move!

757
01:12:36,561 --> 01:12:37,608
Move!

758
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:39,738
Go away!

759
01:12:52,952 --> 01:12:53,999
Fuck!

760
01:12:55,746 --> 01:12:56,793
Get away!

761
01:13:59,644 --> 01:14:00,691
Come on!

762
01:14:03,522 --> 01:14:04,569
Wanker!

763
01:14:42,645 --> 01:14:43,271
Come on!

764
01:14:47,441 --> 01:14:48,988
Rachel, wait! - Why?

765
01:14:49,068 --> 01:14:50,069
This Way!

766
01:15:06,669 --> 01:15:07,716
Rachel!

767
01:15:08,212 --> 01:15:10,260
Tweeter! Should we move?

768
01:15:10,256 --> 01:15:11,633
Beach. Let's go.

769
01:15:26,522 --> 01:15:28,695
Hold him up! Hold him up!

770
01:15:31,777 --> 01:15:33,779
Rachel, please help me!

771
01:15:37,241 --> 01:15:39,243
Tweeter get him off me!

772
01:15:39,952 --> 01:15:40,999
Go go 90 go!

773
01:15:47,376 --> 01:15:50,095
Whatever! Come on, you make it!

774
01:15:55,968 --> 01:15:57,015
Go go 90 go!

775
01:16:08,981 --> 01:16:10,654
You okay? You okay?

776
01:16:13,611 --> 01:16:15,079
This island's fucked.

777
01:16:15,071 --> 01:16:17,369
We gotta move. What's this?

778
01:16:20,451 --> 01:16:24,957
The boat! Give that to Rachel,
she knows what to do.

779
01:16:28,751 --> 01:16:29,798
Take it...

780
01:16:31,796 --> 01:16:32,843
I'm armed!

781
01:16:37,051 --> 01:16:38,268
Kurt, asshole!

782
01:16:38,636 --> 01:16:39,683
Get away!

783
01:16:42,556 --> 01:16:43,603
Okay!

784
01:16:45,810 --> 01:16:47,483
I come in a second!

785
01:16:48,437 --> 01:16:49,484
C'mon, Rach!

786
01:16:57,029 --> 01:16:58,497
Tweeter, come on!

787
01:17:00,699 --> 01:17:01,746
Rachel!

788
01:17:04,370 --> 01:17:06,623
Get inside! Quick! Rachel?

789
01:17:10,668 --> 01:17:11,794
Rachel! - No!

790
01:17:12,837 --> 01:17:13,884
Come in!

791
01:19:28,138 --> 01:19:29,606
Oh Elvis! Rachel!

792
01:19:32,559 --> 01:19:35,859
Oh god oh! I'm so sorry!
I'm so sorry!

793
01:19:36,021 --> 01:19:37,773
I'm so sorry! C'mon!

794
01:19:39,066 --> 01:19:40,113
Okay, c'mon!

795
01:19:41,694 --> 01:19:42,741
C'mon!

796
01:19:45,197 --> 01:19:47,700
Tweeter, maybe you need this!

01:19:55,541 --> 01:19:59,762
The pier's a half-mile downshore.
I'm gonna lure'em one way,

and I'll meet you at the boat.
Okay? Come on!
