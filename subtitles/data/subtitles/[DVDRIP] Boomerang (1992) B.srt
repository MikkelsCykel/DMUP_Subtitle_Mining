00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:04,153
Can you tell me
what time the show starts?

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:09,632
- Course I am.
- I wanna know when the show starts.

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,036
Hold on for a second. What?

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,151
What time does the show start?

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,396
The show started a half an hour ago.

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,272
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,358
- You're very good at this job.
- I know this.

8
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,389
Some punk-ass nigger.

9
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,269
Yeah, hi. What time did
Flight 97 from Toronto get in?

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,675
Three hours ago? OK, was there
a Jacqueline Broyer on the plane?

11
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,997
You can't give that information?
This is Flight Information, right?

12
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,432
Then why do you call it Flight...?
Forget it. Forget it. Thank you.

13
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,391
Can you see if there've been any
accidents between JFK and midtown?

14
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,988
Well, what the hell is 911 for?

15
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,190
Well, I wanna talk to a supervi...

16
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,359
- Hello.
- You finally decide to show up.

17
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,349
I had some meetings that ran over,
so I had to take a later flight.

18
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,431
And you can't pick up a telephone
and call somebody, right?

19
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,075
I would've called, but they didn't
have a phone on the plane.

20
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:22,671
I wasted $200 on tickets. Just wasted.
And it's all your fault, OK?

21
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,398
I'm sorry. Why don't I give you
the money for the tickets?

22
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,832
It has nothing to do with the money.
You're bein' inconsiderate.

23
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,430
I was callin' all over New York. You
could've been on a road somewhere.

24
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,518
That's very sweet.
That's very, very sweet.

25
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,319
One of my tricks, OK?
I know the flower thing.

26
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:49,390
Listen, I'm upset with you. What you did
was inconsiderate, and I'm upset.

27
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,956
Well, maybe I should just go.

28
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,113
Yeah.

29
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,036
I'll go.

30
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,310
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

31
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,513
Listen...

32
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,519
Look, I had a long day.
You had a long day.

33
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,269
I'm trippin', I'm buggin' out,
and maybe I'm goin' a little overboard.

34
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:20,349
You dry off. Let's put this whole thing
behind us and just squash this thing.

35
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,475
So, does this mean
that you forgive me?

36
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,275
This means I'm being a bit emotional,
and I acknowledge that,

37
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,675
and we should just squash it.

38
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,558
Well, I think it means you forgive me.

39
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,918
- You have no clothes on underneath.
- No.

40
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,156
You're too much.

41
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,352
You knew you was wrong, that's why
you came over in your drawers.

42
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,040
Cos you knew that it wasn't right.

43
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,950
- It's Jacqueline's.
- Say it.

44
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,638
Jacqueline.

45
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,996
- Whose is it, huh? Whose is it?
- It's yours. It's yours.

46
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,988
Wait, wait, wait,
I don't wanna come yet.

47
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,759
No, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

48
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,878
Oh, yeah.

49
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,513
Oh, yes.

50
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,428
No, wait, wait, don't do nothin'.

51
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,396
No... Don't you say nothin'.
Don't say nothin'. No, don't touch me.

52
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:55,389
Don't touch me. Don't move.
Don't do nothin'. Just hold still. Hold...

53
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,751
No, no. Don't, don't. Oh, no. Shit.

54
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,032
You knew I was coming.
You knew I was. You knew I was.

55
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,156
I have to call my mother.

56
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,749
Where you goin'?

57
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:31,034
Home. I have to give a speech
in the morning to the board of directors.

58
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,549
But thank you. You were great.

59
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,792
God, Marcus, I was so tense when I got
off the plane, but you really relaxed me.

60
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,314
So, Mr Graham, thank you.

61
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,398
You really have to go?

62
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:52,149
But I'll call you
sometime tomorrow, OK?

63
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,236
Get some sleep.

64
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,756
Call me.

65
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,397
- Would anyone care for some dessert?
- Yeah, I'll have the tiramisu.

66
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:50,036
- I just want some coffee.
- And for the lady?

67
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,151
I am on a diet.

68
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,589
- v ery good.
- Diet? Diet, schmiet.

69
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,872
Are you crazy? You look great. I can't
wait to get you down to the Caribbean.

70
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,150
I'm not sure I'm going anywhere.

71
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,115
You've gotta go. Marcus has planned
a wonderful trip. We're gonna have fun.

72
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,435
Yeah. I'm gonna make a phone call.

73
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,233
- Go make a phone call.
- Excuse me. Yeah.

74
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,672
I know you were concerned about
how the layout was gonna be,

75
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,598
but I'm picturin' you
and beautiful white beaches,

76
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,553
and powder-blue skies,
crystal beautiful water.

77
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,399
You stand in the middle of it,
lookin' breathtakin'.

78
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,829
So, when are we gonna fuck?

79
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,831
- What?
- According to Jacqueline,

80
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,428
you are really great in bed.

81
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,072
Jacqueline told you
I was really good in bed?

82
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,634
Well, according to Jacqueline,

83
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:43,355
you really know how to
move your ass, you know?

84
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,434
She told you I know how to
move my ass in bed? OK.

85
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,519
OK, well, I don't know what Miss...
what Jacqueline has told you,

86
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:55,758
but it's not that kinda party,
and I'd appreciate it if... Stop that.

87
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,954
Stop. Stop it. Will you stop it?

88
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,356
<i>Merde, alors.</i> Man, I don't believe this.

89
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:06,951
You are going to turn down
a pussy like this?

90
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,873
Staring you smack in your face?
No man can turn down this pussy.

91
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,390
- Will you stop it?
- I don't know any man that can refuse.

92
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,750
Stop saying pussy, people are eating.

93
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,757
Pussy. Pussy.

94
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,110
Pussy. Pussy.

95
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:26,075
Pussy. Puss, puss, pussy.

96
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:30,309
Tryin' to find our cat. Where is that cat?

97
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,836
- What's the matter with you?
- You don't like women?

98
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,596
Yes, that's it.
I don't like women. I mean, I'm gay.

99
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,599
You're not gay. You're not gay,
you just don't wanna fuck me.

100
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,790
I know a gay man. I know what
a gay guy looks like. My brother is gay.

101
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,876
And you. You. He's gay.

102
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,751
And he is gay.

103
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,350
- OK, what did you say to her?
- What did I say?

104
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,040
I heard this woman
screaming from the bathroom.

105
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,948
How dare you discuss what I do with
you in bed sexually with that woman?

106
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,072
As soon as you leave,
she starts sayin' she wants to fuck me.

107
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,589
- How could you talk about what I do?
- She said that?

108
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,472
- You said it...
- She's a little off.

109
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,433
She starts talkin' about
how my ass moves. I know you said it.

110
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,028
Don't expect me
to sleep with people for business.

111
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,357
- You did with Lady Eloise.
- Excuse me, that is a rumour.

112
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,711
We do not know if I slept with
Lady Eloise. I had a chitchat with her.

113
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,990
- Please, Marcus.
- Please, my ass.

114
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,793
Don't discuss what I do with you
with other people.

115
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,756
I'll handle this.

116
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,590
OK, Strangé, what's the problem?

117
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,669
- I'm not going.
- Now, listen.

118
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,678
You're gonna
have yourself on the plane,

119
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,872
or I will not only take back
the million-two I am paying you,

120
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,755
I will sue you for every goddamn dime
you've got. Do you understand that?

121
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,913
What an absolutely
exhausting evening, huh?

122
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,955
To tell you the truth, Marcus,
I don't feel very well.

123
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,756
Don't touch me. Don't touch me.

124
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,111
You've made me feel dirty.
I don't believe this is happenin' to me.

125
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,515
Look at you. God, Marcus,

126
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:49,155
you're gettin' yourself all upset
and worked up over nothing.

127
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,396
Nothin'? That's what sex is to you.

128
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,234
Whatever happened to
caring and commitment?

129
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,397
Some people still think
things like that are important.

130
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:01,832
You've made it painfully obvious
that you're not one of them people.

131
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:07,080
Well, why don't I give you a second
to think about it, hm?

132
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,476
Really?

133
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:15,589
Yeah. I think you should, you know,
do your own thing.

134
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,156
OK, Marcus.

135
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,236
It's over.

136
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,916
Good night.

137
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,110
Good night.

138
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:06,632
Marcus. Marcus. I don't believe the way
you let her dog you out like that.

139
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,718
You're walkin' around
with your head down, mopin'.

140
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,718
Where's your pride?
Where's your dignity?

141
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,196
You think Malcolm X died so you could
walk around lookin' like a chump?

142
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,039
Bony, not today, OK?

143
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,636
Sad, man.

144
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:28,031
First the Fat Boys break up, now this.
There's nothin' to believe in.

145
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,996
Good morning, Marcus.

146
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,396
Morning.

147
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,558
- Morning.
- Good morning.

148
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,510
Good morning, Marcus Graham.

149
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,718
Morning.

150
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,197
Marcus? Excuse me.

151
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,156
I need the storyboards for the Strangé
spots. I'm shooting next week.

152
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:36,349
- Shoot whatever you wanna shoot.
- Whatever I want to shoot?

153
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,516
It's your show.

154
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:42,315
- I have complete autonomy?
- You the man.

155
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,435
Thank you. Bless you. Bye.

156
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,790
Excuse me. Jacqueline,
can I talk to you for just a second?

157
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:56,038
- Yeah, sure.
- I know it's none of my business,

158
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,915
what's going on with you and Marcus,
but can you try to take it easy on him?

159
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,838
Please?

160
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,476
Excuse me?

161
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:11,349
Well, whatever it is you're doing to him,
it's starting to affect his work.

162
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,472
What I am doing to him?

163
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,958
Yeah.

164
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:27,274
Well, it seems like whatever it is
I'm doing to him,

165
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,153
you are taking rather personally.

166
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:33,989
- Am I mistaken? Huh?
- No, Jackie.

167
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,989
I'm just saying, it's just
affecting his work, that's all.

168
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,475
Well, we don't wanna do that.

169
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,276
Thanks, Jack.

170
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,070
We have something exciting coming up.

171
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:54,512
After months of hard work by our
creative team, you are about to see

172
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:58,599
the commercial that will launch
our $18 million push

173
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,792
for the new Strangé fragrance.

174
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,876
Lights, please.

175
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,913
- How is it?
- I haven't seen it. I let Nelson do it.

176
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:19,989
This is my vision. It is fabulous.

177
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,078
Fabulous.

178
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,799
Strangé.

179
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,195
It stinks so good.

180
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,039
That is ridiculous.

181
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,115
Well, the board
wanted me to let you go.

182
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,229
I convinced them
to give you another chance.

183
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,909
Well, as an employee, I thank you
for saving my job, and as your lover,

184
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,431
- I thank you for ruining my life.
- Come on, I didn't ruin your life.

185
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,120
You ruined your life.
I said this was gonna happen.

186
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,198
I was just hoping
it didn't happen with you.

187
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,998
The only thing that I can suggest is...

188
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,673
perhaps you should
take a few weeks off.

189
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,478
OK.

190
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:41,839
There's this one kid that you are gonna
love. He is so cute. It'll really lift you up.

191
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:47,318
Marcus. I am not gonna let you sit and
mope all day long. Now snap out of it.

192
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,591
Have you been listenin' to me?
Cupid has his foot in my ass.

193
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,950
I have the cure for Cupid, all right?

194
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:57,835
Now, when I have problems with my
relationships, which is most of the time,

195
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:03,796
I find out that it's better to take the
focus off myself and put it to others.

196
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,195
I don't wanna be around no kids.

197
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:11,269
I wanna go home and sit in my house
and look at the wall and listen to Sade.

198
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,039
- And that's fun?
- No, but that's where my head is at.

199
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,676
That's where I need to be. I don't wanna
paint. You can't paint my misery away.

200
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,591
- Hi.
- Hi, Angela.

201
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,712
Thank you.
Everybody, this is Mr Graham.

202
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,677
Who did that?

203
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:34,191
These are kids I teach art to whose
schools can't afford an art programme.

204
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,551
- That's so nice.
- Now, remember last week we saw...

205
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,717
- I'm gonna whup somebody's ass.
- Sit down, Marcus.

206
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:44,150
Remember last week we looked at
collages from Romare Bearden?

207
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,317
- Yes.
- And what were you supposed to do?

208
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,795
Bring your own collages.

209
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,434
OK, who wants to show me theirs first?

210
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,548
Oh, boy. Kenny.

211
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,757
<i>Assalam alaikum,</i> my brother.

212
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:04,236
- Greetings, my Nubian princess.
- My king.

213
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:07,079
This is the sun,
and these are the sunrays,

214
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,998
and this is a big, giant,
huge hole in the ozone layer,

215
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:15,274
and this is what'll happen to people if
we don't fix up the ozone layer quickly.

216
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,595
That's very Afrocentric.
I like this, Khanya.

217
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:22,430
- What a lively little thing you are.
- OK, tell us about this.

218
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,991
This is my house. This is the sun.

219
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,999
This is a spear, and this is a shield.

220
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,076
Then we have...

221
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,316
That, right here,
is my fish bowl, and this is blood.

222
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,513
Then these are my clothes,
and these are the fish.

223
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,393
Yeah, why...?
This is the fish bowl up here, right?

224
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:48,718
And these are the fish, and this is the
floor. Why aren't the fish in the bowl?

225
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:52,515
- Because I don't want them there.
- But they can't live on the floor.

226
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,997
Art can be very abstract. It doesn't have
to make sense. Only in the artist's mind.

227
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,396
- Thank you, Khanya.
- Thank you for your interpretation.

228
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,636
OK, who's gonna be next?

229
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,631
You cannot tell me you did not
have fun in there with those kids.

230
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,116
I ain't sayin' it wasn't fun,
I just wasn't in the right mind-set.

231
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:15,153
Mind-set? You didn't think about
Jacqueline once in there.

232
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,110
True.

233
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,516
I bet you didn't think about
the Strangé commercial either. Right?

234
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:23,918
Yeah, you're right. The kids are a little
more inspirational than I've been lately.

235
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,996
Thank you.

236
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,352
- I got an idea.
- What?

237
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,870
I got an idea for the Strangé ad.

238
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,235
OK. Slow it down.

239
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,109
Right there.

240
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,951
OK. What do you think?

241
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,150
Well, I like it.

242
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,750
Hold it. Is that a nipple?

243
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:59,592
- That's not a nipple. That's a shadow.
- That's a nipple.

244
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,469
- Excuse me, that is a shadow.
- I think it's a shadow of a nipple.

245
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,637
Come on. Stop playing. That's a nipple.

246
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,910
- It's a shadow.
- I'll blow it up.

247
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,993
It's a nipple, cos I'm droolin'.

248
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:22,230
You a little nervous
about meeting Gerard's parents?

249
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:27,640
No, I'm not. I just don't want them
to think we're a couple, you know.

250
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,753
Don't even trip. Gerard ain't even
that close to his father, first of all.

251
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:35,668
You know, I knew it.
Gerard is really a fun guy, isn't he?

252
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,473
- He's very much fun.
- It's his father and his mother

253
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,591
that are the square ones.

254
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,996
- Right?
- I got it.

255
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,636
Happy Thanksgiving.

256
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,669
- Hey, what's up?
- Angela's over there.

257
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,951
How you doin', Mr Jackson?
Happy Thanksgiving.

258
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:59,269
- You look great.
- Thank you. So do you.

259
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,233
Thanks. My parents are here.

260
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,508
- You look just like your dad.
- Thanks.

261
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,428
- I brought you some chitterlings.
- Gerard's mother...

262
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:14,348
Angela, Gerard's mother brought us
a whole trough of chitterlings.

263
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,436
- I'll take the chitterlings.
- I want a bowl.

264
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:20,030
This the little girl you been
talkin' about? Agatha?

265
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,670
Angela. Angela Lewis.

266
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,438
- That's what I said.
- Nice to meet you.

267
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:28,155
Isn't she pretty?
She looks like one of Marcus' girls.

268
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:35,471
Agatha, go in the kitchen and help
Mrs Jackson with these chitterlings.

269
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,318
Cutie pie.

270
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,591
I have to talk to Mr Jackson.
Mr Jackson, come here.

271
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,678
So good to see you.
Every year, you do something new.

272
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:47,395
- Where'd you get the mushroom shirt?
- I'm trying to impress you.

273
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,511
I know. Now, where'd you get the shirt?

274
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:53,394
The secret is you got to coordinate.
Most people don't coordinate.

275
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,239
- See, you got to coordinate.
- That's what you did.

276
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,749
- Interesting.
- See? I told you they don't stink

277
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,155
- when you pull the membrane out.
- Momma.

278
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,590
- You saw me, saw the mushroom shirt.
- I said "mushroom shirt".

279
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,029
See, you can't stop
with the mushroom shirt.

280
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,355
- I would've stopped.
- You gotta keep goin'.

281
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:13,155
- Now, let me show you somethin'.
- You got on a mushroom belt.

282
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,556
Gerard, did you know your pops
had a mushroom belt on?

283
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,353
- Yes.
- But you don't stop there, see?

284
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,914
- You gotta keep goin'.
- What you got, a mushroom ring?

285
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,838
That's a good idea. Look what I got.

286
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,596
Gerard.

287
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,719
Did you know on the inside
was special mushrooms?

288
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,795
Yes.

289
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,231
Simply delicious, Marcus.

290
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:40,311
I tell Yvonne she should take cookin'
lessons from you. All she cook is pork.

291
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:44,513
I'll bet we've eaten everything
on the pig from the rooter to the tooter.

292
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:48,834
- The whole pig, huh?
- You didn't marry me for my cookin'.

293
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,518
You got that right, baby.
That's why we got junior.

294
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,109
Daddy, please.

295
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,710
Must you embarrass me in front
of my friends on every occasion?

296
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:05,637
Now, see? That's your son. Private
school got him all saddity like that.

297
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,955
Yeah, man, chill. That's your father.

298
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:12,596
Mr Jackson, Angela made this meal.
I can't take credit for it. It was Angela.

299
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,109
- v ery good.
- v ery good.

300
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,435
- Good pick, junior.
- Daddy.

301
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:20,518
I told you that Angela and I
are just friends.

302
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,350
- Just friends, huh?
- Yes.

303
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,596
- Just friends.
- Leave it alone, hon.

304
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,950
They told you that 500 times.
Just let it go.

305
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,196
Fine. We'll change the subject.

306
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:39,709
Now, Marcus, I hear a girl
at the office got you pussy-whipped.

307
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:45,199
Why don't you reverse it?

308
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:48,915
Don't be pussy-whipped.
Whip that pussy. Look.

309
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:53,354
Daddy, please.

310
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:58,155
If you really insist on standin' around,
I don't dig the long face.

311
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:02,432
Man, my parents been in that bathroom
damn near an hour, man.

312
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,711
- So what?
- Well, they been in there hittin' it.

313
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:13,196
- Your parents are smokin' a joint?
- No, they been in there fuckin'.

314
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,433
Damn. Goodness.
What's for dessert? Wow.

315
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,357
I'm all right, man.
Let's go. Let's go eat, man.

316
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:06,471
- You don't want me to go with you?
- No, I'd better run them home

317
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,592
- before they embarrass me any further.
- OK.

318
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,598
I had a great time. I'll call you tomorrow.

319
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:17,236
Mrs Jackson. I cannot tell y'all
how much fun it is to be with y'all.

320
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,920
- So good.
- A piece of coat, I think.

321
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:24,431
Oh, boy. The rabbit is gettin' old, baby.
Look at that.

322
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:28,473
We could tear another piece off
and make some earrings. Coordinate.

323
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,558
- Yo, yo. Yo, got a hook-up for tonight.
- Who?

324
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:36,435
Remember that little girl I met in
Emergency? Baby got her stitches out.

325
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,192
- Well, whatever. I'll rap to you.
- All right. I gotta go.

326
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,757
- OK, bye, Tyler. Take care of yourself.
- See y'all later, all right?

327
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,677
- Later.
- Bye.

328
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,872
- You don't want me to help?
- I got it. Go on home.

329
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,558
OK.

330
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,836
Where's my coat?

331
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,158
Angela.

332
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,154
Yes?

333
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,840
I'm gonna have to
take you up on that offer.

334
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,520
- I thought so.
- Yes.

335
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:16,395
Chitterling juice everywhere,
and I don't know if I can handle it alone.

336
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:26,234
I'm so tired. I don't care if I never see
another cup or plate again in my life.

337
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,838
- My feet. Can I take my shoes off?
- Yeah, you can.

338
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:33,270
You'll have the whole house
smellin' like funky corn chips.

339
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,836
- Please, my feet do not stink.
- <i>Star Trek's</i> comin' on.

340
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,678
- I love <i>Star Trek.</i>
- Do you really?

341
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,792
- Yeah, I'm a Trekkie.
- Get outta here. I'm a Trekkie.

342
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:46,630
Ain't Captain Kirk the coolest
white man on the planet?

343
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:51,834
You can always tell who's gonna get
killed. Now, look who's beamin' down.

344
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:55,509
You see Kirk, McCoy, Spock,
and Yeoman Johnson.

345
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:58,029
Doesn't Yeoman Johnson know
he's gonna get killed?

346
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:02,915
If I was Yeoman Johnson, I'd say "I'm
not goin'. I know what's gonna happen".

347
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:10,472
It's amazing how you've just broken
down this whole <i>Star Trek</i> thing.

348
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:14,752
I'm a Trekkie, that's why. I broke it
down to the barest essence of the Trek.

349
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,519
I'm a Trekkie.
I know everything about <i>Star Trek.</i>

350
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,757
- What's Captain Kirk's first name?
- Captain.

351
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,996
No, it's not Captain.

352
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,270
His name is James T Kirk.

353
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,915
What's Mr Spock's last name?

354
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:36,232
You didn't even know that.
Name is Spock Jenkins.

355
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:39,113
One of the Jenkins boys from vulcan.

356
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,155
We'll talk about it later.

357
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,073
What are we doin'?

358
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,156
We're kissing.

359
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,835
We ain't supposed to be kissing.

360
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,473
- Why?
- Cos we're friends.

361
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,879
So?

362
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,956
Friends can kiss.

363
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,157
Do something
CRAZY

364
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,955
It's good. It's very good.

365
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:58,390
- Congratulations, Marcus.
- Congratulate Angela.

366
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,670
It was mostly her idea.

367
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,835
Nice going, Angela.

368
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,798
Thanks.

369
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,398
Hey, you.

370
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,589
Yo, man. It's racial.

371
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,790
- Well, expand.
- All right, check it out.

372
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:21,038
The white ball dominates everything.
Knocks the shit out of the yellow ball,

373
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:24,471
the red ball, right? And the game's over

374
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:29,549
when the white ball drives
the black ball completely off the table.

375
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,918
Now why is that?

376
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:36,271
I don't know, but I'm sure
you'll tell me, my brother.

377
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:40,277
Sure you right. Look...

378
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:44,109
It's because of the white man's fear

379
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:48,552
of the sexual potency of black balls.

380
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,999
Now, that one was kinda interesting.
I see where you're goin'.

381
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:59,193
- The pool table is earth, so it's green.
- See, your shit is comin' out now.

382
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:02,153
And the world,
they used to think it was flat.

383
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,235
School him.

384
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,476
When you do Oprah,
I wanna be front row.

385
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,956
It's not about jokes.
Me and him are here.

386
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,709
That one was kinda deep. You went to
the bottom of the ocean on that one.

387
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,035
- Losers get the beer.
- I'm gonna get the beer...

388
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:17,311
- But see how our thing is here?
- We are on the same wavelength.

389
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,590
- We're the same cat.
- Get him, then.

390
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:23,030
- I'll get him. I'm gonna work on him.
- Fine.

391
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,997
Yo, man, he's gettin' worse.
We got to find him a woman, quick.

392
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,111
He's gonna be all right.

393
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:32,312
Hey, how are things
with you and Angela?

394
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,548
We're cool, man. You know.

395
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,558
We went out a couple times,
and she was gettin' so involved.

396
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:41,990
And I said "Look,
I'm just gonna pull back."

397
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,314
Cool.

398
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,637
Yeah. You know, I told her
"Look here, girl, do your thing."

399
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:50,150
"See other men, cos I'm gonna
see other women, you know."

400
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:54,478
I just didn't wanna break her heart
right off. You know, I just pull out easy.

401
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,914
Good. You don't mind if
she goes out with other guys?

402
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,996
Hell, no.

403
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:04,116
You thinkin' of
hookin' her up with Tyler?

404
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,073
- No, nothin' like that.
- Why you askin', man?

405
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,156
I was just curious.

406
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,910
I don't believe this shit.

407
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,596
Why you askin', man?

408
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,391
You can't even look me in my eye,
can you, Marcus?

409
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,030
Did you sleep with Angela?

410
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,836
Yeah, I did.

411
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:08,435
Why do you always have
to have all the girls, Marcus?

412
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,710
You said you didn't care
who she went out with.

413
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:13,274
Now you're flippin'.
You're bein' a hypocrite.

414
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,868
I don't wanna hear that bullshit, man.

415
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,878
This is different. Angela is a nice girl.

416
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,388
- So I can't be with a nice girl?
- No.

417
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:27,911
Cos all you gonna do is dog her out,
like you do every woman in your life.

418
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:31,510
OK, tell me this, man. Why Angela?
What, she has nice feet?

419
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:34,518
It has nothin' to do with her feet.
I care about this girl.

420
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,996
Man, you don't care about
nobody but yourself, man.

421
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:50,119
So, when we can rise as a people,
we runnin' things, you know?

422
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,438
- What'd you do, man?
- Guess.

423
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,634
Marcus. Come quick.
I got somethin' I wanna show you.

424
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,910
- What?
- I wanna show you something.

425
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:11,271
- Get outta here. I'm in the shower.
- Marcus.

426
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,356
Stop.

427
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:16,836
Come on, I'm soakin' wet. You
gonna make me catch a cold out here.

428
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:22,080
No, I won't. Look.
Well? What do you think?

429
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,991
- Blue people. Yeah, that's nice.
- What do you think?

430
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,838
- Do you like it?
- Yes, very much.

431
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:31,714
OK, OK, OK. Look at it and
tell me how it makes you feel.

432
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,877
- Honestly, it's makin' me kinda horny.
- No. Feel.

433
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,117
- I'd like to think I was the inspiration.
- No. Look.

434
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:41,277
- I think you should be blue.
- No. You'll get paint all over me.

435
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,470
- The phone's ringing.
- I'll get paint on you.

436
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:47,593
Take your clothes off.
Take 'em off. Off. Clothes...

437
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,676
No. Hello?

438
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,595
Jacqueline. Hi.

439
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,551
How you doin'?

440
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:58,355
He's right here, actually.
No. No, we weren't busy at all.

441
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,040
Here he is. OK.

442
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,996
Hey. Yeah.

443
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:11,919
No, that was Angela.
She just stopped by for a second.

444
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,398
Really? That's...

445
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,470
Your spot tested through the roof.

446
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,800
Yeah. Yeah, she's happy.

447
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,594
Yes, absolutely. Absolutely.

448
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,597
That's perfect. Great.

449
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,631
Yeah. Peace.

450
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,957
They're showin' the spot
to the board of directors on Friday,

451
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:37,275
and Jacqueline wants me to be there.

452
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,356
Great.

453
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,076
Wait. You don't have
a problem with that?

454
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,919
- No.
- I will call her and tell her that...

455
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,996
You sure?

456
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,716
Cool. That's bad.

457
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,156
Blue people.

458
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,472
Peace. Chill.

459
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,157
You are brilliant. God, Marcus,
they loved it. They loved it.

460
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,350
Did you hear him
screamin' <i>"magnifique"</i>

461
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,792
with a bead of sweat runnin' down his
face, man? I knew I had that cat.

462
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:34,037
Marcus, you are incredibly talented.

463
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:39,198
Well, I thank you.
Lady Eloise thanks you.

464
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,515
Tell her I said hey.

465
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:44,349
I'm sure Strangé would like
to thank you personally.

466
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:47,752
Yeah, she'd like
to thank the hell outta me.

467
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:57,594
I have to say, it's very nice
to have the old Marcus back.

468
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,549
- I was kinda worried about you.
- Really?

469
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,836
You seemed...

470
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:07,158
You seemed so... I don't know.

471
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,671
- Can I be honest?
- Please.

472
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:14,476
Well, you seemed desperate,
and unsure of yourself.

473
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,239
- Pathetic?
- Kind of.

474
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:24,152
But look at you now. You're...

475
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,555
You're relaxed.

476
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,671
You're more confident.

477
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,758
Just like the man
I met in that elevator.

478
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,195
- I got it goin' on again?
- Yeah. I like it.

479
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,515
I find it very attractive.

480
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,793
How'd it go last night?

481
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,676
It went OK.

482
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,430
Just OK?

483
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:55,509
Must've gone pretty well. You didn't
get home until the middle of the night.

484
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,356
I went for a walk so I could sort
some things out that was in my head.

485
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,994
I was trippin' on it.

486
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:08,588
Like the fact that
you still love Jacqueline?

487
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:11,593
Angela, I saw the woman,

488
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:15,110
and a bunch of stuff in me
I didn't know was still there came out.

489
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:21,588
Things happened and... There's certain
things you just have no control over.

490
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:24,029
Really? Like what?

491
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,113
Like love.

492
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,958
Love?

493
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:32,390
You know,
what do you know about love?

494
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:35,673
What do you possibly think
you know about love?

495
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:40,078
I'm sick and tired of men using love
like it's a kind of disease you just catch.

496
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:43,590
Love should have brought
your ass home last night.

497
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,319
- Didn't you hear me say I was sorry?
- I heard you.

498
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:50,591
You're sorry and you're tired.
You don't love me or Jacqueline.

499
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,314
You only love your damn self.

500
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,510
How could you say
I never cared about you?

501
00:39:55,640 --> 00:40:00,156
Jacqueline says that I'm a better person
now, and I owe that all to you.

502
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,396
I'm outta here.

503
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,158
I'll get the rest of my things later.

504
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:14,309
Let me just tell you one more thing.
I might not be all glamorous,

505
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:19,036
and I don't have hair down my back, but
let me tell you one great thing about me.

506
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:22,914
I've got a heart. You know the bad
thing about having a heart, Marcus?

507
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,191
It's that it gets broken
when you deal with people like you.

508
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,914
Now stay the fuck outta my life.

509
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,840
She left you, huh?

510
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,032
Yeah. She did.

511
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,913
I guess I should feel happy, but I don't.

512
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:00,793
I hate to see another person in pain.

513
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:06,316
Thank you very much. That's very nice
of you, Yvonne. Good night.

514
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:11,230
So, would you like to come over
for a cup of coffee?

515
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,758
Not even if Jesus was pourin' it.

516
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:20,230
Some motherfuckers can't see
a good thing when it's starin' at them.

517
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:24,512
Why don't you just leap your black ass
off the ledge, then? Fuck you.

518
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,156
- I can't do this.
- I have condoms.

519
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,078
No, it's not that. I gotta go.

520
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,678
What?

521
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,398
I'm in love with somebody.

522
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:13,270
Angela, right?

523
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,550
So now you think
you're in love with Angela.

524
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,272
No. No, no.

525
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:21,439
I know - just at this moment,
I know I'm in love with that woman.

526
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:29,714
Marcus, if you are in love with Angela,
why are you here with me?

527
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,676
Exactly.

528
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,077
Oh, shit. Dammit.

529
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:15,390
Hold up.

530
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:22,919
- Yo, whassup?
- Whassup?

531
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,758
Come on in.

532
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,476
- Welcome to the penthouse.
- It's kinda smoky in here, chief.

533
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,750
No, no. Wait. That ain't smoke, all right?

534
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,678
That's aroma.

535
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:38,078
Yo, can you get that for me?
Think that might be a little surprise.

536
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:52,078
Whassup, man? Where you goin'?

537
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:58,876
Yo, man. Talk.

538
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,398
Whassup, man?

539
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:12,114
Hey, how you doin'?

540
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:21,113
So have you seen Angela lately?

541
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,918
No, I hear she's over
at Barton and Dobbs now.

542
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:31,873
Yeah, I heard she got
promoted to creative director.

543
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,594
Really? Where'd you hear that?

544
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:39,316
Bony T told me.

545
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,592
Look, man.

546
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:50,315
- You don't have to say anything.
- I do. I'm really sorry, Gerard.

547
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:54,956
I've known you all my life, man. You're
like my brother, you know, and I...

548
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:58,834
I love you and I...
I don't wanna go through this, man.

549
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:02,077
Listen, it happened,
and I'm sorry, and I feel bad.

550
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:05,272
How long you gonna have me beg?
You know what I'm tryin' to say.

551
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:08,517
You gonna
milk all the apologies outta me.

552
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:09,516
It's cool.

553
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,835
- All right, man.
- My man.

554
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:22,912
Yo, man! Whassup? Y'all gonna let a
girl come between us, man? What's up?

555
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,156
We supposed to be here, man.
We boys, man.

556
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:28,590
We don't hang out no more or nothin',
man. Man, this shit hurt, man.

557
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:32,395
- Y'all make up now, man.
- We just, you know, made up, man.

558
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:33,396
Well, then, hug.

559
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:37,355
We hugged just now, and gave
each other a pat and we boys again.

560
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:39,755
- All right. Give it to me.
- We hugged already.

561
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:43,595
No, man. I want
a big motherfuckin' hug, man.

562
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:46,280
Damn, man. I love y'all, man.

563
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:50,794
- Y'all ready to eat?
- Yeah.

564
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:52,876
All right.

565
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,956
Yo, is that my shit?

566
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:00,071
Damn, not the penthouse.

567
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:38,352
No. It's all wrong.
You know that memo I showed you?

568
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:41,870
Refer to it and show me
a new mock-up in the morning.

569
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,869
This is way off, Tye. We are not
gonna shoot this until it's right.

570
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,956
- Angela.
- Come on.

571
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:54,277
- Hi. We're lookin' for Angela...
- We are not.

572
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:58,714
What?

573
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,995
Excuse me for a second, please.

574
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:12,878
- What are you two doing here?
- Angela.

575
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:17,435
- I haven't seen you in so long.
- Four months, two weeks, to be exact.

576
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:20,518
- Thank you.
- We miss you. Where have you been?

577
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,676
I miss you, too, and I've been working.

578
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:26,315
I got a new job. It's very demanding.
It requires me to work long hours,

579
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:29,477
and I haven't had the time
to teach the class. I'm sorry.

580
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:31,636
You always had time for us.

581
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:36,473
I know. Let me tell you somethin', OK?

582
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:42,269
You know what I had to do? I had
to rearrange my priorities in life.

583
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:45,870
Angela had to start
lookin' out for Angela.

584
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:50,677
- How'd you get here, anyway?
- Our new teacher brought us.

585
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:54,634
- Your new teacher? Where is she?
- He.

586
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,349
Well, where is he?

587
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:04,194
I think we best get goin' now.

588
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:06,709
Goodbye, my queen.

589
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:10,114
- OK.
- Peace.

590
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:12,196
My brother.

591
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:21,432
It's pretty low using the kids, Marcus.

592
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:25,473
What else could I do? I been sendin'
you letters and I know you got 'em.

593
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:28,273
I'm just not real big
on words on paper these days.

594
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:31,996
OK. I know I fucked up.

595
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:35,157
You're damn right you fucked up.
You hurt me.

596
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:40,238
I miss you.

597
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:42,396
No. I really, really miss you.

598
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:45,990
I've never missed anybody in my life
and I miss you. I'm in love with you.

599
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:50,636
It isn't about your love. It's the fact that
you can't love me the way I deserve.

600
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:52,637
That's what this is about.

601
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:56,548
You think I'd bother you unless I was
ready to be everything you wanted?

602
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:59,433
I wanna be straight up about
everything. I want monogamy.

603
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:01,471
You are my best friend. I'm miserable.

604
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:05,878
- I even quit my job because of you.
- Did I ask you to quit your job?

605
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,629
- Why are you doin' this?
- Doing what?

606
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:14,196
Bein' all stiff and cold,
and hidin' behind your work.

607
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:18,598
I'm taking care of my business,
and I suggest you take care of yours.

608
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:20,278
Listen.

609
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:25,148
I know havin' a great job is cool
and all of that but...

610
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:28,635
you used to have a good time.

611
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:31,354
You used to be with these kids
and we used to have fun.

612
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:33,391
We had a great life. You had everything.

613
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:37,798
Give me one reason
why I should take you back. One.

614
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:53,231
I didn't think you could.

615
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:57,630
Do you still love me?

616
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:03,478
Because I love you so much.

617
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:09,075
I miss you.

618
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:11,871
I'm scared.

619
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,956
And I'm miserable.

620
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:20,233
I can't breathe without you.
I can't breathe.

621
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:23,276
I can't breathe.

622
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:35,709
We should go get your things
and go to my place.

623
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:39,799
No. I'm not moving into your house
this time. I'm staying in my place.

624
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:41,512
I want 24-7.

625
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:43,312
- No.
- That's how committed I am.

626
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,000
No. No. I'm not doin' it.

627
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:48,918
If you turn and look at her
I will break your fuckin' neck.

628
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:53,591
I was lookin' at this woman, thinkin'
about the future. That's you in 15 years.

629
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:58,271
- You better still love me.
- She's by herself. I'm playin'. It's you.
