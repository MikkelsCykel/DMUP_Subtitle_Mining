Why is the State prosecuting Mr Ruiz

00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,912
when his son was molested
by Andrew Pechinsky?

Allegedly molested. Mr Ruiz should have
gone to the police with his allegations.

31
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,635
Instead, he chose to go
to Mr Pechinsky's home and shoot him.

Wasn't Ruiz just protecting his son?

-We do have laws in this country.

Mr Ruiz broke them.

He put Mr Pechinsky in a wheelchair for life

with attempted murder.

00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,670
You have a viable organ
and a local recipient.

159
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,313
If you try to ship these lungs
across the country

160
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,594
you're not helping anybody.

161
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:24,150
There are 98,000 people
on the transplant list, Mr Stanton.

162
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,118
2,100 of them want lungs.

163
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,556
A hundred and ninety-eight
from the Region Five alone.

164
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,392
Every case is exceptional.

165
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,875
Excuse me.

166
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,793
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

167
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,156
-Hello.
-Is this Frank Wells?

168
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,390
-Yeah. Who's this?
-You're looking for Navarro?

169
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,790
-Go to Clinica Cruz Blanca.
-Yeah. Yeah.

170
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,440
On Avenida Jose Gorositzo.
You will find him there.

171
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,438
Avenida Jose Gorositzo. Who is this...

172
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,798
You got a problem, puto? Huh, gringo?

173
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,518
-I don't want any trouble.
-Then you should not kick the door.

174
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,789
You hear me?

175
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,035
Shit.

176
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,635
-I just want to talk to a doctor.
-You just want to talk, huh?

177
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,035
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

178
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,388
What's in his wallet?

179
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,392
There is no licence. Nothing. Only money.

180
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,358
Turn around! Turn around, puto! Come on.

181
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,909
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

182
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,235
He doesn't have anything.
Not even a passport.

183
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,039
Who the fuck are you?

184
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,912
Where did you come from?

185
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,991
I just want to talk with Dr Navarro.

186
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,875
Dr Navarro, huh?

187
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,515
We're the bosses around here!
You talk to us!

188
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,149
Stop it.

189
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,912
You'll kill him.

190
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,155
You speak to us. Understand?

191
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,993
Go home!

192
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:06,636
After consulting my colleagues
I'm afraid they are of the opinion that

193
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,875
Chloe's entering Stage Four.

194
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,838
That's the final stage, right?

195
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,395
Oh, my God.

196
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,038
I'm sorry, Diane.

197
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,555
Yeah.

198
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,472
There is a rumour that has been nagging
at me for some time

199
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,279
and I ran a name through UOOS.

200
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,550
There's only two reasons
for a patient to go off the list.

201
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,719
They either get a transplant or they die.

202
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,751
This has to remain confidential.

203
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,914
-James Harrison?
-James Harrison.

204
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,639
The James Harrison?

205
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,634
According to his medical information,

206
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:15,038
in 2001 he had a two-year life expectancy.

207
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,512
And then a few months later,
he was taken off the list.

208
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,999
What are you saying?

209
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,713
He must have found an alternative solution.

210
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,911
I'm sorry. Are you saying he might
have had an illegal heart transplant?

211
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,676
Possibly. Different countries
have different laws and resources.

212
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,994
We call it "organ tourism."

213
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,874
In China they sell the organs
of inmates on death row.

214
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,112
In Iran, a person can sell
his own kidney legally.

215
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:48,674
If you are in need of a transplant
and have money

216
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,358
there are options.

217
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,472
You were right, Paul.

218
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:01,238
The lungs did die
on their way to Salt Lake City.

219
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,756
I don't think we can depend
on UOOS to save Chloe's life.

220
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,875
What are you going to do about Harrison?

221
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,194
What can I do?

222
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,834
Talk to him. Ask him about the transplant.

223
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,155
And say what?

224
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,430
"Excuse me. My doctor,
who may now lose her licence,

225
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,317
"illegally provided me
with your medical information.

226
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,476
"And I was just wondering
if you wouldn't mind telling me,

227
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,950
"now your political career's over,
where you picked up your new heart."

228
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,632
This is about your career.

229
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,435
'Cause if Harrison actually
gave you the information,

230
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:32,354
you might have to do something that
might compromise your superior morality.

231
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,398
That's fucking unfair.
This isn't about my career.

232
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,919
It's about me not breaking the law.

233
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,719
Fine. You want to be
on the right side of the law?

234
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,193
Go defend child molesters.

235
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,309
Wait.

236
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,669
Please.

237
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,759
Please, I'll pay you.

238
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,197
-It's empty, cabron.
-I'll pay you later.

239
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,392
Fuck you!

240
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,516
Hey. Just give me my keys!

241
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,669

Dr Navarro.

Any of you heard of Dr Navarro?

261
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,633
Tico and Chepe fucked him up.

But they didn't steal anything.

263
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,518
They left his wallet, keys and cell.

264
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,189
Do you have them?

265
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,594
I have the cell.

266
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,353
What did Tico and Chepe want with you?

267

I don't know. Tico, Chepe?

-You do? Will you take me there?

Okay, you take me where they work.
I'll pay you then.

Get in.

-Get in.
-How do I know you'll pay me, cabron?

Forget about Tico and Chepe.

and I take you good places.

-Ten dollars.
-No, I...

I don't want ladies. I'm married.

291
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,035
Okay. To the left.

-That is left.

Which is right, pendejo.

00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,911
Mr Harrison, Paul Stanton is in your office.

296
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,634
Hi, Paul. What can I do for you?

297
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:37,591
Well, I've been thinking
about the Pechinsky case.

298
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,992
Maybe you were right.

299
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,116
I don't know.
I thought you were handling it pretty well.

300
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,638
What would you do?

301
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,029
Me?

302
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,633
I'd get the hell out of it while I could.

303
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:56,392
You don't want to get cornered
with this case, Paul.

304
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,631
This Pechinsky's a scumbag.
Everybody knows that.

305
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,432
He got what he deserved.

306
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,469
Let the father do minimum time.
Get back to his family.

307
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,797
It's not about pursuing
the law to its limits, Paul.

308
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:12,037
It's about what kind of society
you want to raise your kids in.

309
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,439
Don't you think?

310
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,155
Huh?

311
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:22,070
I'm going to take some time off.
My daughter's not doing too well.

312
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,796
I'm sorry to hear that, Paul.
If there's anything I can to help...

313
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:29,196
You could make a few calls.
Find me a pair of lungs.

314
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,355
That'd be great.

315
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,469
I'll keep her in my prayers.

316
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:19,672
World famous, Hollywood girls.

317
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,313
I told you, no ladies.

318
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,391
Tico and Chepe are in there.

319
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,715
How do you know that?

320
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,872
They work here.

321
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,719
All right. Here you go.
Can I have my cell phone?

322
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,555
-Gracias.
-Gracias.

323
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,515
Amigo.

324
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,077
This is a very dangerous place.

325
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,716
-Oh, yeah?
-For cars.

326
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,995
Oh, yeah?

327
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,399
If you like, I watch.

328
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,557
How much is it going to cost me?

329
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,239
Twenty to watch.

330
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,079
Forty, no stealing.

331
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,871
You come back for a little bit more or what?

332
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,439
I want to talk to Navarro.

333
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,116
I don't know what you're talking about.

334
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,709
Just know I'm not leaving until
you let me talk to him.

335
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,269
No, no.

336
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,634
(INAUDIBLE)

337
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,193
-DIANE: So, Claudia?
-Yes.

338
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,549
-I'll check in at 9:00.
-Don't worry. I'll call you if there's a problem.

339
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,389
Hey.

340
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,875
Hi, honey.

341
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:54,312
Hey, I think those new glasses look
really cute on you.

342
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,799
I look like a nerd.

343
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,035
A cute nerd.

344
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,749
-Hey.
-What's going on?

345
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,671
We're going to the Harrison's fundraiser.
Remember?

346
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,068
I thought you said you didn't want to go.

347
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,349
We're going.

348
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,072
-Isn't mommy beautiful?
-Yeah.

349
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,031
Thank you.
You still have to go to bed at 8:00.

350
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,559
Say goodnight.

351
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,874
You're handsome, too, daddy.

352
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,911
All right, get ready. We're going to be late.

353
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,395
All right. I guess I'll jump in the shower.

354
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,915
Thank you.

355
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:40,473
When Jim asked me to say a few words

356
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:44,269
he dulled the fear I would experience

357
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,039
by plying me with a bottle of Jack.

358
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,073
And offering me a twenty.

359
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:54,795
I told him I couldn't be bought.
So he offered me $50.

360
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:58,595
And I asked him if he thought I was cheap.

361
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,509
So, finally...

362
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,677
I'm sorry. Is there another restroom?
The powder room is full.

363
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,591
Just go upstairs through the bedroom.

364
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:11,749
While I was chasing girls,
Harrison studied at night.

365
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:17,394
Working towards becoming
the incredible man we see before us today.

366
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:26,475
Let's raise our glasses
to the worst patient I've ever had.

367
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:31,959
And the best governor we'll ever find.
Jim Harrison.

368
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,958
Thank you for the kind words, Henry.

369
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,869
Like all good Republicans,

370
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,871
I trust you with just about
anything in the world,

371
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,279
except public office.

372
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,951
I'm humbled by the support
and goodwill out here tonight

373
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,229
and I want to thank you all for coming.

374
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,438
I deeply appreciate it. Thank you.

375
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,514
So, you're Jim's doctor.

376
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,593
-I'm Paul Stanton. I work with him.
-Oh, yes.

377
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,715
I'm not surprised to hear
he's a terrible patient.

378
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,199
-Is he keeping you busy?
-No.

379
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,959
Beer, please.

380
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,794
I've been following the Pechinsky case.

381
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,838
You're doing a great job.
I hate the mob mentality.

382
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,951
Yeah, you're a man after my own heart.

383
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,839
Nice speech, Henry.

384
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,758
I'll have to prove you wrong tomorrow
on the course.

385
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:29,115
-No, I can't play. I'm on call.
-What a shame.

386
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,669
Thanks for coming, Paul.

387
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,676
Harrison knows I'm on to him.

388
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,477
He shut me down the minute
I got near his doctor.

389
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,198
I don't know how I'm going
to get him to talk to me.

390
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,390
-Maybe this will help.
-What's that?

391
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,750
Azathioprine. From his medicine cabinet.

392
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,233
-Jesus, Diane!
-Nobody saw me. I promise.

393
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,349
Well, he's going to miss it.

394
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:14,195
He's got plenty more.
It's like a pharmacy in there, Paul.

395
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:19,110
I mean, he's got Neoral, CellCept, Paramycin.

396
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,636
-Okay.
-They're all anti-rejection medications.

397
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,599
He needs to take one of those pills
every 12 hours to stay alive.

398
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,551
-Who are you?
-Where is Navarro?

399
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:56,438
You want to see him? Sit.

400
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,398
I just need some information.

401
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,351
-What are you doing?
-This is the easy way.

402
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,874
Or I can call your old friends
Tico and Chepe.

403
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,439
No, don't do that.

404
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,758
You do as I say
if you want to meet Dr Navarro.

405
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,471
Are you wearing a wire?

406
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,474
I'm not wearing a wire.

407
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,992
Let me talk to Navarro.
I'll answer your questions then.

408
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,149
Okay?

409
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,994
Please.

410
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,033
If you won't answer my questions,
that's okay.

411
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,639
You can take your time.

412
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,509
-Mommy!
-I'm right here, baby!

413

414

-I saw your name on the UOOS list.

UOOS list? What are you talking about?

Don't insult me, Jim.

458
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:17,592
According to your medical records,
you should be dead.

459
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,999
My medical records?

460
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:22,432
So you've accessed private,
confidential medical records?

461
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,509
I could have you disbarred for that.

-Diane saw the pills in your medicine cabinet.
-What?

463
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,517
Yeah. For someone who acts like
he knows nothing about this,

464
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,596
you're sure as hell taking
a lot of anti-rejection medication.

465
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,033
So now you're breaking into my house?

466
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,509
Forget about being disbarred.
I could have you thrown in jail.

00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,715
I don't know. Inside information,
access to the UOOS list.

478
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,909
I don't know.

479
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,553
All I know is, they knew I had money
and was desperate.

480
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:14,869
Why didn't you tell me?

481
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,839
I don't know these people.

482
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:20,310
I don't know how to make contact with them.
I don't even know where it is.

483
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:21,749
Where... You know...

484
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,829
I mean, all I...

485
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,229
Look, I met the guy at the border.

486
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,918
I gave him 100 grand.

487
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:36,070
He drugged me and took me to the clinic.
That's how it happened.

488
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,078
Where do you get the medication?

489
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,589
Dr White. I had to come clean with him.

490
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,511
You got to get me in touch with these people.

491
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:47,034
You don't get in touch with them!
They call you.

492
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,189
Why haven't they called me?

493
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,952
I don't know! I don't know.

494
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:59,036
Look. I've never taken a bribe.
I've never used my position for personal...

495
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:03,953
You know. But I did break the law.
And I'm not proud of it.

496
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,358
If this thing came out

497
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,712
I guaran-damn-tee you,
it's the last thing they'll talk about.

498
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,076
-Give me a name. I need some...
-I don't have...

499
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,754
Just give me a name.

500
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:27,635
The guy who contacted me,
the man that I met at the border.

501
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,389
He told me his name was Dr Navarro.

502
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,391
I don't even know
if that's his real name or not.

503
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:38,837
That's what he told me. That's all he told me.
That's all I can give you, Paul.

504
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,469
That's all I can fucking give you!

505
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,032
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

506
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,198
Dr Martinez.

507
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,549
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

508
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,193
Hurry up. Get me Dr Martinez.

509
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,039
Do you see how bad he looks?

510
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,029
Dr Martinez.

511
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,789
El Jefe.

512
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,115
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

513
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,434
Can you take a look at my friend?

514
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:00,109
He had a bad night and is out of money.

515
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,071
-Hector Martinez.
-Paul Stanton.

516
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,076
Looks like you've had quite a night.

517
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,233
How did this happen?

518
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,759
-I fell.
-Of course.

519
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,715
Come with me.

520
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,192
Jefe helped me.

521
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,637
-Oh, yes. Jefe. "The Boss."
-Yes.

522
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,189
Esperate aqui, Miguel.

523
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,628
Miguel?

524
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,751
See you later. Paul.

525
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,070
How do you know, Miguel?

526
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,794
I met him tonight with his gang.

527
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,157
Oh, yes. The familia.

528
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:46,111
We call them Los Olvidados.
"The Forgotten Ones."

529
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,397
They're street kids.

530
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:54,112
We get them occasionally
for a free meal or a check-up.

531
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,670
-Can I ask you a question?
-Of course.

532
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,959
What's the local policy
regarding organ transplants?

533
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,475
Why are you here, Mr Stanton?

534
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,588
It's just a question.

535
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:25,153
I have a friend who's waiting for a donor.

536
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:35,797
Well, basically, just like in the US.

537
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:43,279
Mexican law requires prior written consent
from the donor or the next of kin.

538
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:46,792
So it's the same ranking system as there?

539
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,348
Or can people jump the line here?

540
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:53,998
You're wondering if you should send
your friend down here to buy a cheap organ.

541
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,198
I've heard about this organ tourism.

542
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:59,312
Pick up a sombrero, some tequila,
and a kidney.

543
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:02,159
-No, it's not anything like that.
-You're done.

544
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:08,195
It's an urban myth that
body parts are for sale in Mexico.

545
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:12,115
We've got our own people who need organs
and we don't have spares lying around.

546
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:15,272
I'm sorry. I know. I didn't mean to offend you.

547
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:18,352
It's just that my friend's desperate.

548
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:21,991
You want to see desperation? Follow me.

549
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,029
Look.

550
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:32,238
There are countless facilities like this and
still not enough to meet the social demand.

551
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,553
Everyone you see is facing a death sentence.

552
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,509
And we don't have the resources
to save them.

553
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:43,113
If you'll excuse me, I have patients waiting.

554
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,389
Good luck to your friend.

555
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:14,556
Okay, okay. I'll give you your $100.
Here, Here.

(SPEAKING SPANISH)

557
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,792
I told you I would pay.

558
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:45,955
Keep the change.

559
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,679
I got it.

560
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,431

00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,077

00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:06,157
Okay, El Jefe.

564
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,632
Is that your wife?

565
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:14,829
Si, and my daughter, Chloe.

566
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:19,839
She is very beautiful.

567
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:22,549
Yes, she is.

568
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:28,993
You be careful, amigo.

569
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:33,111
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

570
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:35,834
I'll be fine.

Hey, hey!

574
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:23,114
-Get the fuck out!
-Open the fucking door!

575
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:25,874
-Where's Navarro?
-I don't know!

576
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:28,997
Where is he? Who set me up?

577
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:33,636
-Aguilar! Aguilar! I work for Aguilar!
-Who the fuck is Aguilar?

578
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:36,473
He owns the club!
He's the one who told us to film you.

579
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:41,555
We do it all the time
with the guys he wants to blackmail.

It's disgusting! I should... Get dressed.

(SPEAKING SPANISH)

582
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:25,755
I'm sorry, Mr Aguilar.

Or shall I call you Dr Navarro?

587
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:48,036
You have some balls coming here.

588
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:54,989
I came here because my daughter's dying
and she needs a lung operation.

589
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,399
Really?

590
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:59,718
I thought you came down here
for a Turkish aperitif.

591
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:05,075
This should entertain the other prosecutors
in your office.

592
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:18,398
You know what?
You can post that on the Internet if you want.

593
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:19,708
I don't give a shit.

594
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:23,437
I just want to save my daughter's life.

595
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:30,591
It's too high risk.

596
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,392
We'll take our chances.

597
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:36,510
You say that now.
But what if she dies on the table?

598
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,798
You are part of the American justice system.

Are you going to come after us?

600
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:47,276
How am I going to come after you?
I'd be an accomplice.

601
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:53,195
I mean, come on, we both know you've
done business with people like me before.

602
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:58,108
That was different. We contacted him.

603
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:01,108
He didn't know who we were. He came alone.

604
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:05,919
And if he died on the table,
that would not have been a problem for us.

605
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,275
I'm not going to leave unless you help me.

Okay.

609

Mr Stanton, we're going to
make an exception for your daughter.

610
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:12,192
The price is $200,000 cash, non-negotiable.

611
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,513
You'll give the money to Arturo.

612
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:17,398
Here is the address.

613
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:22,315
Leave your cell phone number here
and we'll call you with instructions,

614
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,356
when we receive the money.

615
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:26,354
How can I trust you?

616
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,279
You can't.

617
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:34,758
But then again you don't
have to do business with us.

We're going now?

620

There's a mule going to the house.

621
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:02,233
Wait until he gets there, then you go in.

622
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:05,993
-Get out of the car.
-I can't get out here.

623
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:08,717
Please, pull around the corner.

624
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:30,995
Now get out.

625
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:35,590
I'm sorry for what I did.

626
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:37,554
It was just a job.

627
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:44,914
What's your name?

628
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:47,916
-What's your real name?
-Carlos.

629
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:50,638
But I prefer Ines.

630
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:58,234
Well, Carlos,

631
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:01,997
do you know where that is?

632
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:05,235
This part of town is owned
by the Perros cartel.

633
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:07,557
Not even the police go there.

634
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:08,789
I need to find Arturo.

635
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:11,714
-You ever heard of him?
-No.

636
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:17,588
But you don't want to go there alone.
That place is very dangerous.

637
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:18,999
I grew up in that dump.

638
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:23,030
Okay, Carlos, you help me find Arturo.

639
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:27,432
You watch my back
and I'll try to help you get out of Juarez.

They're here.

642
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:07,754
Give them five minutes and then we move in.

643
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:34,237
Put your hands up.

We're here to see Arturo.

00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:41,515
Fine.

649
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:04,431
They said they knew you.

650
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:05,913
You fucking idiot.

651
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:10,193
Aguilar sent us.

652
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:12,594
I don't know Aguilar.

653
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,433
It's a mistake.

654
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:17,515
Mistake?

655
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:18,635
We better get the hell out of here.

656
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:22,475
Where are you going?

657
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:23,595
I'll kill you.

658
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:25,155
We have the wrong address.

659
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:26,309
We're leaving.

660
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:27,389
You're staying here, asshole!

661
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:43,235
What is that?

662
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:56,315
Give it to me.

663
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:04,759

664
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,992
Check the back!

Come on.

666
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:03,350
-Okay.
-Get him on the stretcher.

667
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,275

This is Ines.

677
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:14,870
Hello, Ines. You just hang in there, all right?

678
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:38,432
Excuse me, is Dr Martinez here?

679
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:41,870
No, he's on nights.
Dr Sullivan is covering for him.

680
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:46,474
-He's a volunteer.
-What do you mean volunteer?

681
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:49,400
We don't have enough qualified people
to deal with our situation.

682
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:51,152
These doctors come down here to help us.

683
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:07,433
Yeah, sorry, but are all the doctors
who volunteer foreign?

684
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:09,397
Yes. Dr Martinez was only the first.

685
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:12,790
He moved here 20 years ago
and started the clinic.

686
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:16,236
He's done a lot for this place,
through this organisation.

687
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:19,279
What organisation?

688
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:22,198
I'm sure you've heard of them.

689
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:24,072
Doctors Across Nations.

690

They thought one of her lungs
had collapsed.

Oh, shit.

What did Dr Rubin say?
How much time do we have?

699
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:15,755
Hold on.

700
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:22,034
I'll be right back, honey. Okay?

701
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,431
A week. Maybe less.

702
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,590
They're not doing anything here.
I've tried everything.

703
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:39,358
Then come home, Paul.

704
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:42,877
We need you here.

It's Dr White.

-What?
-Hey, excuse me. Is that Dr White?

708
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:08,719
Is that Dr White? Dr Henry White.

709
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:09,875
-I gotta call you back.
-Paul?

710

I'll call you back.

Dr White comes down here a lot.
Did you know him?

01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:17,872
Yeah, I work with one of his patients,
James Harrison.

713

Maybe you know him. Jim?

-No.
-No?

Did Tico and Chepe beat you up again?

No, no, but it's very important
that I find Dr Martinez.

What are you doing here?

728
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:40,396
Yeah, I didn't realise you were connected
with Aguilar until tonight.

729
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:42,072
What do you mean?

730
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:47,756
Through these clinics, you're coming
in contact with American doctors.

731
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:50,753
One of the doctors mentions,
shall we call him "Dr White,"

732
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:52,717
that he's got a patient
who's desperate for a new heart.

733
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:57,120
Aguilar, or should we call him "Dr Navarro,"

734
01:02:57,560 --> 01:02:59,949
tracks the patient down
and promises to help him.

735
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:02,196
The patient pays his money and a week later,

736
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:04,032
he's brought down here
and given a new ticker.

737
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:07,353
I got to hand it you.

738

It's one hell of a cover, your charitable clinic.

-Helping the poor, homeless, runaway...
-I do help the poor.

740
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:17,631
The money from those operations
keeps the clinic running.

Come in.

742
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:23,629
Come in.

743
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:27,429
Juarez is the murder capitol of Mexico.

744
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:29,153
The city of death.

745
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:34,998
Everyday dozens of people die
from drugs, violent crime, traffic accidents.

746
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:37,469
Sit down.

747
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:44,675
Here in Mexico,

748
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:49,789
orphans, homeless and poor people
don't fill out donor cards.

749
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:54,152
So, when they die, their hearts, lungs,
and kidneys cannot be legally used,

750
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:56,276
regardless of demand.

751
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:59,991
Should more people die
because of such a technicality?

752
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:02,511
We don't think so.

753
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:06,830
We are firm believers
in the law of presumed consent.

754
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:10,835
You're familiar with the concept, no?

755
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:17,194
Yeah, you assume everyone's a donor
unless they state the contrary.

756
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:19,039
-Exactly.
-Right.

757
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:22,513
Some countries
have already adopted this law.

758
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:25,715
We take from those already dead...

759
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:27,432
This is not what...

760
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:31,188
This is not what I was expecting. I thought...

761
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:34,039
What did you expect?

762
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:43,194
I thought I was buying my way
to the top of the Mexican donor list.

763
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,560
Even if it were possible,
buying your way to the top of the list

764
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:49,950
only cheats a Mexican child out
of a life-giving opportunity.

765
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:52,713
What we're doing only cheats death.

766
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:56,637
We live in a war zone down here.

767
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:01,674
The murder rate in Mexico
is three times that of the US.

768
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:06,152
What is wrong with using dead people
to save other people's lives?

Do not negotiate with your daughter's life,

773

Get in.

-Hi.

01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:55,871
-We're at the border.
-Good.

799
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:58,395
I'll meet you at the clinic. How's Chloe?

800
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:02,073
Hanging in there.
Thank God you got them to help us, Paul.

801
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:06,749
I love you.

802

I love you.

803
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:17,513
Hey, honey, we're going to have to
take off the mask for a second, okay?

804
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:18,909
Let's hide it.

805
01:08:24,280 --> 01:08:26,430
Hi. Thank you.

You're better than the bank.

01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:45,795
Don't get used to it.
It's the last you're going to get.

812
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:49,108
Miguel, you're killing me.

813
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:52,433
Me too.

814
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:56,910
And everybody else I suppose? Right?

815
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:01,149
See you later.

816
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:03,271
Don't leave.
You're forgetting him.

817
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:04,919
My little friend.

-Hey, what's your name?
-Camaroncito.

-Camaroncito? What does that mean?
-Little shrimp.

It'll be okay.

829
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:04,072
Calm down.

830
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:07,915
We'll get you to the hospital.

-We'll take care of him.

Back up, back up. Give them room.

We'll get you to the hospital
and you'll be fine.

What hospital?
What hospital are you taking him to?

What hospital?

843

Who called the ambulance?

844
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:36,512
Did anyone call the ambulance?

We've secured a donor.

What the fuck are you doing?
What are you talking about?

Young boy. Hit and run. It's a tragedy.

But for you a miracle.

No, don't do this. Don't do this. Please.

We'll be operating within the hour.
You should join your daughter, okay?

Son of a bitch.

We have to get your daughter
prepped and ready for surgery.

-Already?
- Si, we have a donor.

Don't tell me. I don't want to know, Paul.

You don't mean that! Diane!

We can't go back now. You understand me?

I don't care where they found those lungs.

But if we don't get one to Chloe
she's going home in a fucking casket.

You don't mean that! Diane!

You said you were only using the dead.

Ideally, yes, but sometimes
these cases require immediacy.

You pushed us.

900

Did you really expect a perfect match
would die within 12 hours?

You knew exactly what you were doing
when you crossed the border.

Maybe not this week or next.

But kids like this don't last long in Juarez.

Another boy dying here means nothing.

909
01:16:23,160 --> 01:16:26,914
But a pair of lungs for your daughter,
that's worth something, isn't it?

910
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:31,432
Do you want to do the right thing?

911

There's still time.

912
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:37,640
You paid for the surgery.
We can still save the boy.

913
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:40,354
But it will certainly mean
your daughter's death.

914
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:27,989
Thank you.
