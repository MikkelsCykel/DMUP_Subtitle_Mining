1
00:03:18,261 --> 00:03:20,161
Mrs. Claus is hot!

2
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,534
My name is Samantha Caine.

3
00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:27,532
At least, I think it is.

4
00:03:27,704 --> 00:03:31,037
You might not believe it,
but I was born only eight years ago...

5
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:33,199
on a beach in New Jersey.

6
00:03:33,377 --> 00:03:37,780
I entered the world fully grown,
wearing clothes I don't remember buying.

7
00:03:37,948 --> 00:03:41,111
In the back pocket,
a single key filed blank and faceless.

8
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:44,278
Fitting metaphor,
but otherwise no help whatsoever.

9
00:03:44,454 --> 00:03:45,785
None.

10
00:03:45,889 --> 00:03:49,620
Sometimes I stand naked in the mirror.
Try to guess my age.

11
00:03:50,293 --> 00:03:52,227
Maybe 35?

12
00:03:52,396 --> 00:03:54,455
I have lots of scars.

13
00:03:55,532 --> 00:03:58,558
They call my condition
"focal retrograde amnesia. "

14
00:03:59,136 --> 00:04:02,264
It's no picnic,
but I've learned to live with it.

15
00:04:02,339 --> 00:04:04,807
Got a job I love.
Been seeing someone.

16
00:04:05,108 --> 00:04:07,269
Nice guy.
Good sense of humor.

17
00:04:08,412 --> 00:04:10,573
- Hound of the Baskervilles.
- Mad dogs.

18
00:04:11,148 --> 00:04:12,308
- Hal?
- Yes, Sam.

19
00:04:12,482 --> 00:04:15,747
Of all the Christmas pageants
I've ever seen...

20
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:18,080
this is by far
the most recent.

21
00:04:18,588 --> 00:04:22,957
For God's sake, Sam, I have
teenage girls playing the wise men.

22
00:04:23,026 --> 00:04:25,517
- What did you expect?
- Teenage boys?

23
00:04:25,796 --> 00:04:27,286
I thought they did fine.

24
00:04:27,597 --> 00:04:32,000
It was the first Nativity where
Joseph stares at the wise men's tits.

25
00:04:34,271 --> 00:04:35,602
Her name is Caitlin.

26
00:04:35,772 --> 00:04:39,606
When I woke up on that long-ago day,
I was two-months pregnant with her.

27
00:04:39,776 --> 00:04:43,405
I don't know who her father is.
I may never. I just know she's mine.

28
00:04:44,981 --> 00:04:48,041
His name is Mr. Perkins.
My mom named him for me.

29
00:04:48,118 --> 00:04:50,109
Caitlin, come help in the kitchen!

30
00:04:50,187 --> 00:04:51,279
That's her.

31
00:04:51,354 --> 00:04:53,185
- That's who?
- Her mom.

32
00:04:53,256 --> 00:04:54,883
She's got amnesia.

33
00:04:55,025 --> 00:04:55,923
Swear?

34
00:04:55,992 --> 00:04:57,016
Swear.

35
00:04:57,861 --> 00:04:59,021
Too weird.

36
00:05:01,064 --> 00:05:02,395
Hello, girls.

37
00:05:02,566 --> 00:05:04,557
Caitlin, come help me
in the kitchen.

38
00:05:04,734 --> 00:05:06,895
Hurry up,
I forget where it is.

39
00:05:29,159 --> 00:05:30,148
Raymond!

40
00:05:30,327 --> 00:05:32,887
Catch you smoking, they'll never
find the body. Understand?

41
00:05:33,497 --> 00:05:34,589
Yes, Ms. Caine.

42
00:05:34,764 --> 00:05:35,753
Have a cookie.

43
00:05:39,603 --> 00:05:41,935
As the year draws to a close...

44
00:05:42,105 --> 00:05:46,041
I would like to share with you
just a few things about myself.

45
00:05:46,109 --> 00:05:48,270
Things of which
I am especially proud.

46
00:05:49,012 --> 00:05:51,344
First, I'm proud to say that...

47
00:05:51,515 --> 00:05:53,278
I don't smoke...

48
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:54,610
I don't drink...

49
00:05:54,784 --> 00:05:56,342
and I don't swear.

50
00:05:56,853 --> 00:05:59,344
Oh, shit,
I do smoke and drink.

51
00:06:03,527 --> 00:06:05,290
To our dear friends.

52
00:06:05,529 --> 00:06:09,795
May the best of your past
be the worst of your future.

53
00:06:09,966 --> 00:06:11,456
I'll drink to that.

54
00:06:12,135 --> 00:06:16,299
Take a bow, my dear. Take a bow.
We got the mistletoe.

55
00:06:26,316 --> 00:06:27,806
Eight years.

56
00:06:29,219 --> 00:06:31,710
Except for my name,
all traces are lost.

57
00:06:31,888 --> 00:06:35,051
I used to hire expensive detectives.
Now I use the cheap ones.

58
00:06:35,225 --> 00:06:37,750
Doesn't seem to matter.
The woman I was...

59
00:06:37,827 --> 00:06:40,091
the one I used to be,
she's gone.

60
00:06:40,163 --> 00:06:41,824
I've kissed her goodnight.

61
00:06:44,467 --> 00:06:45,798
Police! Don't move!

62
00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:47,659
What the hell is this?

63
00:06:48,371 --> 00:06:50,532
Don't give me attitude, sir.

64
00:06:50,607 --> 00:06:53,371
You're assuming I won't shoot
your sorry ass.

65
00:06:53,443 --> 00:06:58,176
When you make an assumption,
you make an "ass" of you and "umption. "

66
00:06:59,649 --> 00:07:02,709
I'm Sgt. Madigan, Vice,
and if you do cop a 'tude...

67
00:07:02,886 --> 00:07:06,378
I will see to it you spend the next
10 years in prison getting ass-fucked.

68
00:07:06,556 --> 00:07:09,320
If the case is thrown out
because my arrest was violent...

69
00:07:09,492 --> 00:07:12,893
I will hire men to ass-fuck you
for the next ten years.

70
00:07:13,096 --> 00:07:14,586
So if you're an ass-fucking fan...

71
00:07:14,764 --> 00:07:16,857
go ahead and mouth off.

72
00:07:17,033 --> 00:07:20,366
Meanwhile, you're under arrest
for the crime of prostitution.

73
00:07:20,737 --> 00:07:21,726
Officer Dunleavy...

74
00:07:21,905 --> 00:07:23,600
read him his rights.

75
00:07:23,673 --> 00:07:25,664
- What?
- His rights.

76
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:28,541
You have the "remight"...

77
00:07:28,712 --> 00:07:30,737
You have the right
to remain silent.

78
00:07:30,914 --> 00:07:32,882
Anything you say and do...

79
00:07:32,949 --> 00:07:34,746
will be held against you...

80
00:07:34,918 --> 00:07:36,783
Please, listen, I got a wife.

81
00:07:36,953 --> 00:07:38,284
I never.
This is the first time...

82
00:07:38,455 --> 00:07:41,219
I've ever done this.
I swear!

83
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:42,883
Sir! Listen to me.

84
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:46,395
I can see from your choice here,
you're not a wealthy man.

85
00:07:46,963 --> 00:07:49,363
Because of the damage
this arrest could do to you...

86
00:07:49,532 --> 00:07:51,796
I think we might be able
to make an arrangement.

87
00:07:54,804 --> 00:07:56,032
Oh, God!

88
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,972
Gotta stop using bums.

89
00:07:59,142 --> 00:08:00,404
Forget that.

90
00:08:00,577 --> 00:08:03,740
They looked like cops.
We pulled it off, didn't we?

91
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,470
It was embarrassing.

92
00:08:05,649 --> 00:08:07,378
You want me to hire actors?

93
00:08:07,651 --> 00:08:10,313
These guys are cheap.
They work for food.

94
00:08:10,487 --> 00:08:12,546
When they puke,
is that a like a refund?

95
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,835
- What's this?
- I got movement on Samantha Caine.

96
00:08:17,237 --> 00:08:18,898
Really?

97
00:08:19,072 --> 00:08:21,563
No, I may have a lead on someone...

98
00:08:21,741 --> 00:08:24,835
who rented Amnesia Chick
an apartment back in 1987.

99
00:08:25,011 --> 00:08:27,241
They may still have
some of her stuff.

100
00:08:27,414 --> 00:08:28,403
Get outta here.

101
00:08:28,581 --> 00:08:29,741
Where'd that come from?

102
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:31,076
Lucky break.

103
00:08:31,251 --> 00:08:35,415
Old lady died, and one of her
asshole grandkids found a credit card...

104
00:08:35,588 --> 00:08:37,351
with the name Samantha Caine on it.

105
00:08:37,524 --> 00:08:39,685
Tried to use it at Nordstroms.

106
00:08:42,028 --> 00:08:43,689
Okay, here's what we do.

107
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:47,866
Get on the phone to Amnesia Chick.
Tell her we need more cash.

108
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:00,110
That was a really swell party.

109
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,872
Thanks again for the ride.

110
00:09:03,049 --> 00:09:07,383
You and Hal have been together,
what, a couple of years?

111
00:09:08,888 --> 00:09:10,617
How often do you two...

112
00:09:11,057 --> 00:09:15,118
Stick our fingers in our hands and
pull them out? Every chance we get.

113
00:09:15,295 --> 00:09:19,095
Earl, do me a favor? Every few words
blow bubbles and say "hic. "

114
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:22,061
Goddamn it, I'm not drunk!

115
00:09:22,569 --> 00:09:24,093
I'll prove it to you.

116
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,471
Come on.

117
00:09:29,142 --> 00:09:30,370
Stop that!

118
00:09:30,543 --> 00:09:31,771
I'm sorry.

119
00:11:29,395 --> 00:11:32,330
And so much for the skydiving Santa
of Hutchinson County.

120
00:11:32,498 --> 00:11:34,398
Meanwhile, WICC news...

121
00:11:34,567 --> 00:11:38,663
journeyed to Honesdale, where Santa's
own Mrs. Kringle turned out...

122
00:11:38,838 --> 00:11:41,170
to celebrate her hubby's
worldwide tour.

123
00:11:41,341 --> 00:11:43,571
And after one look at her,
I'm thinking...

124
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:46,576
Santa got what he really wanted
this Christmas.

125
00:11:46,746 --> 00:11:50,147
The parade included floats
and participants from four counties.

126
00:11:50,216 --> 00:11:52,878
Everyone enjoyed themselves,
especially the young...

127
00:11:52,952 --> 00:11:54,943
and the young at heart.

128
00:11:55,722 --> 00:11:57,917
Gotta be fucking kidding!

129
00:11:58,157 --> 00:11:59,146
No!

130
00:12:01,127 --> 00:12:03,459
No fucking way!

131
00:12:03,596 --> 00:12:05,530
It's impossible!

132
00:12:18,378 --> 00:12:20,278
You rest up...

133
00:12:22,215 --> 00:12:24,206
and I'll see you in the morning.

134
00:12:24,951 --> 00:12:26,384
Sweet dreams.

135
00:12:54,714 --> 00:12:57,148
I want a cigarette.

136
00:12:57,917 --> 00:12:59,214
I don't smoke.

137
00:13:01,087 --> 00:13:02,645
You used to.

138
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,991
See how easy it comes back?

139
00:13:09,162 --> 00:13:11,096
I'm coming back.

140
00:13:11,764 --> 00:13:13,755
You know that, don't you?

141
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,161
Name's Charly by the way.

142
00:13:16,602 --> 00:13:18,263
You're going to love me.

143
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,713
This is the intergalactic slammer.
It's a jail.

144
00:13:30,883 --> 00:13:33,875
This is the Borian dude.
Kind of like a dinosaur.

145
00:13:34,053 --> 00:13:38,786
This is his escape chute. He's mean,
quick, and he don't take no shit.

146
00:13:39,058 --> 00:13:41,117
He can shoot at the guards
with his arrow.

147
00:13:43,563 --> 00:13:45,087
- Cool, huh?
- Todd.

148
00:13:45,965 --> 00:13:47,398
Time for dinner.

149
00:13:48,401 --> 00:13:49,698
Now.

150
00:13:55,742 --> 00:13:57,403
Guess you better go in.

151
00:13:57,577 --> 00:13:59,408
Hope you like the toy.

152
00:13:59,746 --> 00:14:01,236
It's awesome.

153
00:14:03,249 --> 00:14:06,582
Dad, Mom...
she gets weird.

154
00:14:06,652 --> 00:14:10,247
Like on my birthday when you gave me
that Schwinn.

155
00:14:11,924 --> 00:14:15,985
She called the bicycle store to see
if there'd been any robberies.

156
00:14:18,097 --> 00:14:21,089
Tell her I don't steal
them locally, all right?

157
00:14:26,806 --> 00:14:28,933
Sorry, but,
I can't take this.

158
00:14:29,108 --> 00:14:31,235
You know how Mom will get.

159
00:14:34,847 --> 00:14:36,280
Guess I'll see ya.

160
00:14:36,349 --> 00:14:37,543
All right.

161
00:14:43,122 --> 00:14:44,521
How do you like that?

162
00:14:51,464 --> 00:14:54,126
- Yo, Trin, me. What's up?
- Ready to be happy?

163
00:14:55,034 --> 00:14:57,366
Remember the landlady
I told you about?

164
00:14:57,537 --> 00:14:59,698
The Caine woman was
her favorite tenant.

165
00:14:59,872 --> 00:15:02,033
Then one day,
the tenant never comes home.

166
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:06,042
Old lady very sad. So sad she can't
throw away Amnesia Chick's shit.

167
00:15:06,212 --> 00:15:09,204
It's pay dirt, Mitch.
Got an old postcard never mailed.

168
00:15:09,382 --> 00:15:12,044
Woman telling everyone
she just got engaged.

169
00:15:12,118 --> 00:15:14,109
Samantha's handwriting.
Perfect match.

170
00:15:14,187 --> 00:15:17,554
She was engaged to some guy in Jersey.
No phone number, just an address.

171
00:15:17,723 --> 00:15:19,657
Holy shit! Score!

172
00:15:19,826 --> 00:15:21,817
That's worth time and a half.

173
00:15:21,994 --> 00:15:24,895
Double. I made us look good.
Her other P.I. S couldn't find dick.

174
00:15:25,064 --> 00:15:27,658
Course not.
Took a true dickhound like yourself.

175
00:15:27,834 --> 00:15:30,325
Tell Ms. Caine
I'm coming to see her tonight.

176
00:15:42,315 --> 00:15:45,546
Honey, you have an ETA
on that carrot?

177
00:15:45,852 --> 00:15:47,410
Stow it.

178
00:15:49,021 --> 00:15:51,216
Maybe you should just take it
with you to school.

179
00:15:52,191 --> 00:15:54,682
You're killing me.
You're so funny.

180
00:15:56,596 --> 00:15:57,927
Here.
Give me the knife.

181
00:15:58,097 --> 00:15:59,189
No!

182
00:15:59,265 --> 00:16:03,133
I'm going to cut this carrot,
and you're going to eat it and like it.

183
00:16:03,202 --> 00:16:04,169
Piss off.

184
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,609
Hon?

185
00:16:23,055 --> 00:16:24,386
Look, will you?

186
00:16:33,232 --> 00:16:34,597
How the hell?

187
00:16:36,235 --> 00:16:38,066
I used to do this.

188
00:16:38,237 --> 00:16:39,727
I'm a chef.

189
00:16:40,806 --> 00:16:42,239
Look what she's doing.

190
00:16:44,076 --> 00:16:45,407
Give me something else.

191
00:16:45,578 --> 00:16:47,239
Quick, anything!

192
00:16:48,147 --> 00:16:49,478
- Tomato.
- Tomato.

193
00:16:52,585 --> 00:16:53,574
Look.

194
00:16:53,753 --> 00:16:56,722
- Look at this woman go. All right.
- More!

195
00:16:57,823 --> 00:16:59,814
Pepper. Pepper!

196
00:16:59,992 --> 00:17:00,959
Celery!

197
00:17:02,595 --> 00:17:03,823
Look at this!

198
00:17:03,996 --> 00:17:05,258
More!

199
00:17:05,431 --> 00:17:06,830
Scallions!

200
00:17:10,169 --> 00:17:11,227
One more tomato.

201
00:17:12,204 --> 00:17:14,866
Look at this woman.
She's amazing!

202
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:25,849
Chefs do that.

203
00:17:33,793 --> 00:17:36,785
Timothy, I know
you're gonna kill me.

204
00:17:36,963 --> 00:17:39,124
Please use the gun,
not the knife

205
00:17:39,298 --> 00:17:41,528
As a favor to me
I'm begging you.

206
00:17:43,469 --> 00:17:47,633
Goddamn it, how can I tell the Feds
about the fucking "Honeymoon" thing?

207
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:51,100
I don't know
a fucking thing about it.

208
00:17:59,885 --> 00:18:01,648
No, you don't.

209
00:18:01,821 --> 00:18:03,550
I don't know a fucking thing.

210
00:18:04,056 --> 00:18:07,025
You know, I can tell
when someone's lying to me.

211
00:18:10,896 --> 00:18:12,887
What's so fucking important?

212
00:18:13,065 --> 00:18:14,657
Remember your old colleague...

213
00:18:14,834 --> 00:18:15,994
One-Eyed Jack?

214
00:18:16,168 --> 00:18:17,658
He's doing 7-10 upstate.

215
00:18:17,837 --> 00:18:20,237
Not anymore. He broke out.
Two days after seeing...

216
00:18:20,406 --> 00:18:23,170
something on TV that "disturbed" him.

217
00:18:23,342 --> 00:18:26,903
Yeah, "Baywatch Nights. "
You want to get to the fucking point?

218
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:30,048
Under sedation, he said
Charly Baltimore's alive, sir.

219
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:35,585
Daedalus is concerned. He thought
you disposed of her eight years ago.

220
00:18:35,755 --> 00:18:39,418
I know it's highly unlikely, but if she
were alive, she might be in contact...

221
00:18:39,592 --> 00:18:41,082
with the old man
in Massachusetts.

222
00:18:41,427 --> 00:18:42,917
Tap his phone.

223
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:47,263
Tell Daedalus I'm on my way.
Timothy, out.

224
00:19:04,216 --> 00:19:06,446
I can't see Mr. Perkins.

225
00:19:07,053 --> 00:19:09,715
He's there.
He's on the sled, see him?

226
00:19:09,889 --> 00:19:11,379
He's watching you.

227
00:19:11,557 --> 00:19:13,957
He's very excited.

228
00:19:14,627 --> 00:19:15,924
That's better.

229
00:19:16,529 --> 00:19:17,860
Ready to try it alone?

230
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:20,521
I want you to hold my hand.

231
00:19:20,966 --> 00:19:22,900
Just pretend I am.

232
00:19:23,369 --> 00:19:25,132
You can do it.
Piece of cake.

233
00:19:25,304 --> 00:19:26,396
Here we go.

234
00:19:26,572 --> 00:19:27,561
Ready?

235
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:30,573
- Mom, it won't work. Swear.
- Sure it will.

236
00:19:30,743 --> 00:19:34,235
You're one of the X-men.
You're tough. Ready? Let go.

237
00:19:34,413 --> 00:19:37,746
- 3, 2, 1, go!
- Wait! I'm not ready!

238
00:19:37,917 --> 00:19:38,906
Go!

239
00:19:39,085 --> 00:19:41,053
Keep going!

240
00:19:48,828 --> 00:19:50,159
I can't do it.

241
00:19:50,329 --> 00:19:52,092
I want to go home.

242
00:19:52,264 --> 00:19:54,824
I know you're afraid.
That's the whole point.

243
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,262
Can't you see that?

244
00:20:00,606 --> 00:20:02,096
Stop being a little baby
and get up.

245
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:07,308
I can't skate anymore.
My wrist hurts.

246
00:20:13,853 --> 00:20:16,344
Life is pain.

247
00:20:16,522 --> 00:20:17,853
Get used to it.

248
00:20:18,858 --> 00:20:22,624
You will skate
all the way to the shore, princess.

249
00:20:22,795 --> 00:20:24,786
And you will not fall again.

250
00:20:26,866 --> 00:20:28,299
Am I understood?

251
00:20:54,426 --> 00:20:56,485
I'm just guessing, but...

252
00:20:56,996 --> 00:21:00,159
this is a tree house.
I think you wanted a doghouse.

253
00:21:03,435 --> 00:21:04,834
Little joke.

254
00:21:06,939 --> 00:21:09,271
She said that her wrist hurt.

255
00:21:10,776 --> 00:21:12,835
I didn't know it was fractured.

256
00:21:23,022 --> 00:21:24,614
I don't remember...

257
00:21:26,192 --> 00:21:27,853
what I said to her.

258
00:21:29,128 --> 00:21:30,527
I can't remember.

259
00:21:38,204 --> 00:21:39,535
No!

260
00:21:39,705 --> 00:21:41,297
I'm not going to hurt you.

261
00:21:41,941 --> 00:21:44,034
It's not me I'm worried about.

262
00:22:17,509 --> 00:22:18,908
Evening, Charly.

263
00:22:19,245 --> 00:22:20,303
Long time.

264
00:22:25,417 --> 00:22:26,406
Get out!

265
00:23:27,146 --> 00:23:29,910
I want my eye back, bitch!

266
00:24:04,516 --> 00:24:06,006
Chefs do that.

267
00:24:14,793 --> 00:24:17,125
Caitlin! Oh, my God!
We have to find Caitlin.

268
00:24:18,797 --> 00:24:20,697
Slow down!
Your kid's okay.

269
00:24:20,866 --> 00:24:21,992
She's in my car.

270
00:24:23,268 --> 00:24:25,702
Jesus!
What the hell's going on here?

271
00:24:26,305 --> 00:24:27,203
Freeze!

272
00:24:27,706 --> 00:24:29,139
Don't hurt him!

273
00:24:29,308 --> 00:24:30,468
Don't shoot!

274
00:24:30,642 --> 00:24:32,633
Yeah, don't shoot!
Like she said!

275
00:24:33,045 --> 00:24:34,979
Call an ambulance!

276
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:39,811
This man?
He's gonna...

277
00:24:40,486 --> 00:24:42,454
help me find out some things.

278
00:24:42,888 --> 00:24:44,378
So we'll be safe.

279
00:24:44,556 --> 00:24:45,614
You understand?

280
00:24:45,891 --> 00:24:48,052
When will you be back home?

281
00:24:49,828 --> 00:24:52,160
Before you know it.
I swear.

282
00:24:53,665 --> 00:24:54,654
Here.

283
00:24:54,833 --> 00:24:58,166
I want you to keep a candle
burning in the window...

284
00:24:58,737 --> 00:24:59,726
for me.

285
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:03,334
That's called "keeping a vigil. "

286
00:25:06,078 --> 00:25:08,012
That's to light my way home.

287
00:25:10,749 --> 00:25:11,738
Here.

288
00:25:13,352 --> 00:25:15,513
This is to my portable phone.

289
00:25:15,854 --> 00:25:17,412
I keep it with me.

290
00:25:17,923 --> 00:25:19,914
You call me anytime.

291
00:25:28,767 --> 00:25:30,234
Why don't you keep this?

292
00:25:32,938 --> 00:25:34,200
For luck.

293
00:25:35,107 --> 00:25:37,200
Let's have Mr. Perkins wear it.

294
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:39,199
There.

295
00:25:40,946 --> 00:25:41,935
See?

296
00:25:55,894 --> 00:25:57,623
You do what you have to.

297
00:25:59,731 --> 00:26:00,789
But, Sam...

298
00:26:01,967 --> 00:26:03,730
the person you used to be...

299
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:06,128
whatever you find...

300
00:26:06,305 --> 00:26:07,567
I'm not scared.

301
00:26:08,474 --> 00:26:10,465
I never will be.
Not ever.

302
00:26:11,743 --> 00:26:13,074
Thank you.

303
00:26:36,835 --> 00:26:38,268
Mr. Perkins...

304
00:26:38,504 --> 00:26:41,632
you lost one of your agents...

305
00:26:42,341 --> 00:26:45,174
whose training included,
among other things...

306
00:26:45,344 --> 00:26:47,437
counterassassination.

307
00:26:48,447 --> 00:26:51,974
Now she turns up as belle
of the Christmas parade.

308
00:26:52,284 --> 00:26:55,253
That information is two weeks old,
Mr. President.

309
00:26:55,621 --> 00:26:56,781
To my knowledge...

310
00:26:56,955 --> 00:26:58,786
Charlene Baltimore died...

311
00:26:58,957 --> 00:27:02,358
in my employ.
Relic of the Cold War.

312
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:06,624
The kind of violent operative that has
since been eliminated from our ranks.

313
00:27:06,698 --> 00:27:08,290
You recruited this woman?

314
00:27:09,635 --> 00:27:11,660
For Chapter, sir.

315
00:27:12,137 --> 00:27:13,365
Her father was...

316
00:27:13,539 --> 00:27:14,767
a friend of mine.

317
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:17,340
Stop, I don't want
to hear that stuff.

318
00:27:17,509 --> 00:27:19,534
The "intelligence" community.

319
00:27:19,711 --> 00:27:21,201
You people are unbelievable.

320
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:23,371
You dump a mess like this
in my lap...

321
00:27:23,549 --> 00:27:26,882
and then you come whining to me,
"Where's our funding?"

322
00:27:27,052 --> 00:27:29,043
I'll tell you where it is.

323
00:27:29,221 --> 00:27:31,485
Can you say, "health care"?

324
00:27:32,024 --> 00:27:34,458
I'm not talking 'bout moving in

325
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,150
And I don't want

326
00:27:36,328 --> 00:27:38,387
To change your life

327
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:40,821
But there's a warm wind

328
00:27:40,999 --> 00:27:42,660
Blowing the stars around

329
00:27:42,834 --> 00:27:46,235
And I'd really love to see you tonight

330
00:27:47,506 --> 00:27:50,498
I'm not talking 'bout the linen

331
00:27:50,676 --> 00:27:53,839
- And I don't want to change your life
- "Moving in. "

332
00:27:54,012 --> 00:27:55,001
What?

333
00:27:55,581 --> 00:27:56,912
It's, uh...

334
00:27:59,418 --> 00:28:01,511
The song's not about linen.

335
00:28:01,587 --> 00:28:03,179
Yeah, whatever.

336
00:28:03,255 --> 00:28:04,517
So, you cold?

337
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:07,250
- Yeah, freezing.
- Turn on the heat.

338
00:28:07,693 --> 00:28:09,923
It doesn't work,
but it makes a very annoying noise.

339
00:28:10,095 --> 00:28:13,121
- Distracts from the cold.
- I'll pass, thanks.

340
00:28:17,102 --> 00:28:19,332
Who knew I had an old fiance?

341
00:28:21,773 --> 00:28:24,640
And now we're just going
to pay a surprise visit?

342
00:28:26,778 --> 00:28:30,874
There are no bells or whistles
because I don't remember any of this.

343
00:28:31,049 --> 00:28:34,450
That's too bad. That's the cream
of the crop, believe me.

344
00:28:35,554 --> 00:28:37,112
I forgot to ask.

345
00:28:37,289 --> 00:28:39,120
Why is it that you got so far?

346
00:28:39,391 --> 00:28:40,619
Say what?

347
00:28:41,727 --> 00:28:42,785
Well, I mean...

348
00:28:43,562 --> 00:28:45,962
you seem kind of low-rent.

349
00:28:46,298 --> 00:28:47,458
No offense.

350
00:28:47,799 --> 00:28:50,632
None taken.
Really, I was about to...

351
00:28:56,241 --> 00:28:57,230
Shit!

352
00:29:00,312 --> 00:29:01,574
Are you okay?

353
00:29:02,247 --> 00:29:04,408
Is your neck all right?
You don't have whiplash?

354
00:29:04,583 --> 00:29:05,572
What?

355
00:29:06,585 --> 00:29:07,643
I'm just...

356
00:29:08,587 --> 00:29:12,990
Since you almost ran us off the road,
I'm wondering what it is...

357
00:29:13,158 --> 00:29:15,922
that you get
from an experience like that?

358
00:29:16,094 --> 00:29:19,154
Don't get me wrong.
I'm sure it's enriching in some way...

359
00:29:19,331 --> 00:29:24,132
and I know she was probably moved by
some asshole screaming out the window.

360
00:29:24,336 --> 00:29:28,397
I didn't hang out the window and yell.
I checked out her form, okay?

361
00:29:29,174 --> 00:29:32,940
If it's any consolation,
you got her beat hands down.

362
00:29:33,178 --> 00:29:34,509
Really?

363
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,170
Yeah, from the neck up.

364
00:29:37,616 --> 00:29:38,776
This is exciting.

365
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:41,441
You saw her tits.
It's so neat.

366
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:43,781
Look, it's a guy thing,
all right?

367
00:29:44,022 --> 00:29:45,785
Now you got a nice body
and all...

368
00:29:45,957 --> 00:29:49,120
but those, you could see them
coming around the corner.

369
00:29:49,294 --> 00:29:51,489
You got time
to comb your hair. Shit.

370
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,362
What's that?

371
00:29:57,803 --> 00:29:59,327
Charly was my name in the dream.

372
00:30:00,138 --> 00:30:02,606
"To Charly.
Love, Nathan"

373
00:30:03,041 --> 00:30:04,633
"Nathan J. Waldman, Ph. D."

374
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:06,710
All right, let's find a phone.

375
00:30:06,978 --> 00:30:07,876
Found one.

376
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,606
Find his number.

377
00:30:11,416 --> 00:30:14,749
- Take the stand.
- I got it. Now what'll I do with it?

378
00:30:18,824 --> 00:30:20,086
Sit down!

379
00:30:32,671 --> 00:30:33,933
Alice, please.

380
00:30:34,106 --> 00:30:35,596
Your dog, Alice.

381
00:30:35,774 --> 00:30:38,504
It and my appetite
are mutually exclusive.

382
00:30:38,677 --> 00:30:41,510
- What's wrong with the dog?
- It's simple.

383
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:44,774
He's been licking his asshole
for the last three hours.

384
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:48,010
I submit that there's nothing there
worth more than an hour's attention.

385
00:30:48,186 --> 00:30:51,280
And I think that whatever
he's attempting to dislodge...

386
00:30:51,456 --> 00:30:53,287
is either gone for good...

387
00:30:53,458 --> 00:30:55,187
or there to stay.

388
00:30:56,194 --> 00:30:57,627
Wouldn't you agree?

389
00:31:08,306 --> 00:31:09,967
Mr. Waldman...

390
00:31:10,709 --> 00:31:12,540
I got your number from a realtor...

391
00:31:12,711 --> 00:31:15,805
in Massachusetts,
and I'd just like to speak to you.

392
00:31:15,981 --> 00:31:17,312
Who is this?

393
00:31:17,883 --> 00:31:19,783
You tell me, Mr. Waldman.

394
00:31:22,888 --> 00:31:24,617
My full name, please?

395
00:31:26,158 --> 00:31:27,386
God!

396
00:31:27,893 --> 00:31:29,485
It's really you.

397
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:33,490
"Chapter"...

398
00:31:34,065 --> 00:31:35,692
they think you're dead.

399
00:31:35,767 --> 00:31:38,292
- My full name, please!
- You don't know your name?

400
00:31:40,405 --> 00:31:41,895
Your full name...

401
00:31:42,073 --> 00:31:45,167
is Charlene Elizabeth Baltimore.

402
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:50,040
Don't talk, just listen.
You could be in danger, understand?

403
00:31:50,248 --> 00:31:51,510
We must meet.

404
00:31:51,683 --> 00:31:54,151
We must meet straightaway.
Where are you now?

405
00:31:55,587 --> 00:31:57,020
In Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania.

406
00:31:57,189 --> 00:31:58,588
We'll meet halfway.

407
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:01,923
There's a town in New Jersey,
Chesterman.

408
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,352
Tomorrow.

409
00:32:03,528 --> 00:32:05,189
Central train station...

410
00:32:05,363 --> 00:32:06,762
at 11 a. m.

411
00:32:07,098 --> 00:32:08,190
Meet me.

412
00:32:08,767 --> 00:32:10,530
I'll tell you everything.

413
00:32:16,208 --> 00:32:17,869
Signal Daedalus.

414
00:32:18,043 --> 00:32:19,169
We got her.

415
00:32:22,447 --> 00:32:25,883
- Curry Brand cat food.
- Could you spell that, please?

416
00:32:26,051 --> 00:32:27,279
Curry Brand.

417
00:32:27,452 --> 00:32:29,181
All this shit is the same anyway.

418
00:32:29,254 --> 00:32:31,245
Yeah? You don't happen
to have a cat?

419
00:32:31,323 --> 00:32:33,314
What do I need a cat for?
I got a girl.

420
00:32:33,458 --> 00:32:35,449
Yeah, pussy's pussy.

421
00:32:47,606 --> 00:32:49,801
- Mom, can I stay up for "Rugrats"?
- What, sweetie?

422
00:32:50,141 --> 00:32:52,132
"Rugrats. "
I want to stay up.

423
00:32:52,978 --> 00:32:54,809
Yes, you can stay up for "Rugrats. "

424
00:32:55,413 --> 00:32:56,812
I'm gonna go now.

425
00:32:57,115 --> 00:32:58,241
All right.

426
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:00,641
- Mommy loves you.
- I love you too.

427
00:33:00,819 --> 00:33:02,081
Big kiss.

428
00:33:02,254 --> 00:33:03,744
- Bye, Mommy.
- Good night.

429
00:33:06,157 --> 00:33:08,591
Put my glasses in my pocket

430
00:33:10,996 --> 00:33:13,157
Put the jacket on the chair

431
00:33:20,772 --> 00:33:24,264
I sing the things I do,
so I won't forget.

432
00:33:24,676 --> 00:33:25,734
Like...

433
00:33:27,445 --> 00:33:29,845
Turning off the downstairs' light

434
00:33:30,782 --> 00:33:32,841
Before I go to bed at night

435
00:33:38,189 --> 00:33:39,281
Shit.

436
00:33:40,025 --> 00:33:41,185
I can't take this...

437
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:43,293
fucking waiting.

438
00:33:43,862 --> 00:33:45,022
Excuse me.

439
00:33:45,297 --> 00:33:47,356
Do you normally curse this much?

440
00:33:50,468 --> 00:33:51,628
What are you, a Mormon?

441
00:33:52,203 --> 00:33:56,139
Yes, that's why I just smoked
a pack of Newports...

442
00:33:56,308 --> 00:33:58,469
and drank three vodka tonics.
What I'm saying is...

443
00:33:58,643 --> 00:34:01,635
back when we first met
you were all like...

444
00:34:01,813 --> 00:34:04,111
"Oh, phooey!
I burned the darn muffins. "

445
00:34:04,382 --> 00:34:05,815
Now, you go into a bar...

446
00:34:05,984 --> 00:34:10,045
ten minutes later sailors come
running out. What up with that?

447
00:34:10,655 --> 00:34:12,145
Thanks for sharing.

448
00:34:12,824 --> 00:34:14,189
Mind your own damn business.

449
00:34:15,226 --> 00:34:17,660
While you're at it,
if you're going to smoke inside...

450
00:34:17,829 --> 00:34:19,319
close the damn door.

451
00:36:25,457 --> 00:36:26,822
I heard you scream...

452
00:36:27,125 --> 00:36:28,183
Shit!

453
00:36:35,366 --> 00:36:36,355
Henessey...

454
00:36:36,534 --> 00:36:40,800
I didn't know about the gun.
I wasn't hiding things. I swear.

455
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:43,200
- Goddamn it, stop walking!
- I'm going home!

456
00:36:43,374 --> 00:36:44,807
And so are you!

457
00:36:45,143 --> 00:36:46,474
I paid you!

458
00:36:46,878 --> 00:36:48,709
Well, here!
Take your money!

459
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,972
Take it!

460
00:36:51,983 --> 00:36:53,712
I can't go home.

461
00:36:53,885 --> 00:36:57,184
Until I know why that man tried
to kill me, I'm trapped.

462
00:36:57,388 --> 00:37:01,222
It's like I'm in a goddamn prison!
Do you know how that feels?

463
00:37:01,993 --> 00:37:04,223
Yeah, I know exactly
what that's like!

464
00:37:04,395 --> 00:37:06,886
Four years inside.
Marion, Illinois.

465
00:37:07,065 --> 00:37:08,657
A real shithole!

466
00:37:08,833 --> 00:37:11,631
And I'm not going back!

467
00:37:36,261 --> 00:37:39,594
Seven years ago
I was an Atlanta cop.

468
00:37:40,031 --> 00:37:43,592
Me and my partner handled
a lot of impounded shit.

469
00:37:43,935 --> 00:37:46,369
That motherfucker hated me.

470
00:37:46,538 --> 00:37:48,768
I forget why, but he did.

471
00:37:49,374 --> 00:37:50,602
On one weekend...

472
00:37:50,775 --> 00:37:52,766
when he was conveniently away...

473
00:37:52,944 --> 00:37:55,879
some bonds disappeared
from his office.

474
00:37:56,447 --> 00:38:01,043
Lo and behold, when my brothers in blue
responded to an anonymous tip...

475
00:38:01,219 --> 00:38:04,552
you'll never guess what they found
sitting in my closet.

476
00:38:05,456 --> 00:38:06,787
The bonds.

477
00:38:07,058 --> 00:38:08,252
Your partner put them there.

478
00:38:08,326 --> 00:38:10,226
No, I did.

479
00:38:10,395 --> 00:38:12,295
I stole the damn things.

480
00:38:21,739 --> 00:38:25,072
I never did one thing right
in my life. You know that?

481
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:26,572
Not one.

482
00:38:27,312 --> 00:38:29,143
That takes skill.

483
00:38:42,493 --> 00:38:44,256
You just missed our exit.

484
00:38:45,597 --> 00:38:47,326
Give me back my money.

485
00:38:47,999 --> 00:38:48,931
Oh, so you're...

486
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:51,125
I'm taking you
to the train station, yes.

487
00:38:51,436 --> 00:38:52,994
To meet Mr. Waldman.

488
00:38:53,671 --> 00:38:55,502
Here you go.
Merry Christmas.

489
00:38:55,673 --> 00:38:57,004
Bah humbug.

490
00:38:57,175 --> 00:38:59,268
Look out the window.
Shut up.

491
00:39:20,365 --> 00:39:22,629
You know we're about
ten minutes early.

492
00:39:28,539 --> 00:39:30,700
I've got a bad feeling about this.

493
00:39:44,322 --> 00:39:46,722
Put my keys in my left pocket

494
00:39:47,992 --> 00:39:50,893
- Gun in the right-hand side
- It makes a bulge you can see.

495
00:39:50,962 --> 00:39:53,522
I should stick it in my pants
and shoot my damn dick off?

496
00:39:53,598 --> 00:39:55,088
Now you're a sharpshooter?

497
00:40:02,407 --> 00:40:04,875
Going to shake hands with the man

498
00:40:07,345 --> 00:40:09,176
- How you doing?
- Hi.

499
00:40:11,015 --> 00:40:12,243
It's for you.

500
00:40:15,253 --> 00:40:17,346
Another in a long line of...

501
00:40:17,522 --> 00:40:18,750
bad personal investments.

502
00:40:18,923 --> 00:40:22,188
- Excuse me?
- Just saw the ring on your finger.

503
00:40:30,101 --> 00:40:32,035
Do I know you from somewhere?

504
00:40:33,104 --> 00:40:35,095
Back up.
Total pickup line.

505
00:40:35,173 --> 00:40:37,073
Forget I said it.
I take it back.

506
00:40:37,775 --> 00:40:39,436
Thank you for the beer, but...

507
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:41,043
I don't know you, no.

508
00:40:43,381 --> 00:40:44,780
No, you don't.

509
00:40:47,118 --> 00:40:49,018
I can tell when someone's...

510
00:40:49,954 --> 00:40:53,446
lying to me.
I'm sorry to have bothered you.

511
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,052
Yours?

512
00:40:57,695 --> 00:40:58,957
Who's your boyfriend?

513
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:00,222
Some guy.

514
00:41:02,133 --> 00:41:04,567
Okay, people,
I got what I need.

515
00:41:04,736 --> 00:41:06,465
Move in. Do them both.

516
00:41:07,905 --> 00:41:09,372
That man walking this way.

517
00:41:10,475 --> 00:41:11,567
Is that him?

518
00:41:11,876 --> 00:41:13,366
I think so.

519
00:41:22,267 --> 00:41:23,867
Mr. Waldman?

520
00:41:28,326 --> 00:41:29,588
Gun!

521
00:41:41,973 --> 00:41:43,270
Jesus wept!

522
00:41:44,108 --> 00:41:45,097
Let's go!

523
00:41:45,276 --> 00:41:47,437
We got to get to the car.
This way!

524
00:41:47,612 --> 00:41:48,670
Come on!

525
00:41:50,515 --> 00:41:52,176
Go! Go!
No! Come on!

526
00:41:56,754 --> 00:41:57,914
No, this way!

527
00:42:22,447 --> 00:42:23,709
Move it!

528
00:42:24,649 --> 00:42:27,447
Come on, Ms. Caine!
Come on!

529
00:42:34,492 --> 00:42:35,481
Oh, shit!

530
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:39,221
Take this! I got three shots left
in this revolver.

531
00:42:39,397 --> 00:42:41,228
You got a full clip.
Just point...

532
00:42:41,399 --> 00:42:43,299
and spray. Okay?

533
00:42:43,501 --> 00:42:45,196
Ready?
And...

534
00:42:46,938 --> 00:42:48,462
Fuck it!
Run for your life!

535
00:42:51,008 --> 00:42:52,737
There's no way out!

536
00:42:58,349 --> 00:43:00,681
- Jump!
- That's a three-story drop!

537
00:43:00,852 --> 00:43:02,183
Are you crazy?

538
00:43:30,047 --> 00:43:33,312
- What happened?
- I saved your ass. It was great!

539
00:43:33,384 --> 00:43:35,284
We've got to get to the car!

540
00:43:35,953 --> 00:43:37,386
This way.
Come on!

541
00:43:37,555 --> 00:43:38,852
Get down!

542
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:40,784
Get down!

543
00:43:49,734 --> 00:43:50,962
Get in, both of you!

544
00:43:51,135 --> 00:43:52,067
Now!

545
00:43:52,270 --> 00:43:53,601
I said now!

546
00:44:01,946 --> 00:44:04,073
We jumped out of a building!

547
00:44:04,248 --> 00:44:06,978
Yes, it was very exciting.
Tomorrow we go to the zoo.

548
00:44:07,151 --> 00:44:08,413
You're Waldman.

549
00:44:08,486 --> 00:44:11,887
No, I'm the Hill Brothers bean buyer.
Who else would I be? Hang on.

550
00:44:14,325 --> 00:44:16,589
If you want me to talk
in front of him, you may be asked...

551
00:44:16,761 --> 00:44:18,092
to kill him later.

552
00:44:18,262 --> 00:44:21,754
It works for me. Your call.
Fire out the back if you have to.

553
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:25,094
- Old man, how many of those you got?
- Three.

554
00:44:25,269 --> 00:44:26,998
One shoulder, one hip and one here...

555
00:44:27,171 --> 00:44:28,604
right next to Mr. Wally.

556
00:44:28,773 --> 00:44:31,503
Most patdowns never reveal it as
an agent's often reluctant to feel up...

557
00:44:31,676 --> 00:44:32,768
another man's groin.

558
00:44:32,944 --> 00:44:34,138
Other questions?

559
00:44:34,212 --> 00:44:36,112
What's the weather like
on your planet?

560
00:44:36,781 --> 00:44:38,271
Charlene, my darling.

561
00:44:38,449 --> 00:44:40,440
My name is Samantha,
Samantha Caine.

562
00:44:40,618 --> 00:44:43,678
No, forget all that.
The schoolteacher business...

563
00:44:43,854 --> 00:44:46,618
was your cover.
Do you hear me, Charly?

564
00:44:46,791 --> 00:44:49,954
Your memory was gone.
You bought your own cover.

565
00:44:50,127 --> 00:44:51,788
It was a fantasy for Christ's sake!

566
00:44:51,963 --> 00:44:53,692
Samantha Caine never existed.

567
00:44:53,864 --> 00:44:55,627
You wrote the bloody thing!

568
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:58,462
No, it's not a fantasy.
I'm in the goddamn P.T.A.!

569
00:44:58,636 --> 00:44:59,864
Then quit!

570
00:45:00,204 --> 00:45:02,798
You're an assassin working
for the United States Government.

571
00:45:03,641 --> 00:45:04,972
I ought to know.

572
00:45:05,209 --> 00:45:06,540
I trained you.

573
00:45:08,946 --> 00:45:11,278
Get the fuck out of here!

574
00:45:12,984 --> 00:45:14,542
Assassin!

575
00:45:16,287 --> 00:45:17,515
Your father was...

576
00:45:17,788 --> 00:45:20,848
in the Royal Irish Rangers,
assigned to Belfast.

577
00:45:21,492 --> 00:45:24,484
After he was murdered there
in 1975...

578
00:45:24,662 --> 00:45:27,859
his friend, Perkins, adopted you,
or perhaps I should say...

579
00:45:27,932 --> 00:45:30,162
recruited you,
to work for Chapter...

580
00:45:30,234 --> 00:45:34,000
a blackbag operation working
from the U.S. State Department.

581
00:45:34,171 --> 00:45:35,502
You getting this?

582
00:45:36,173 --> 00:45:37,572
October, 1988, you were assigned...

583
00:45:37,742 --> 00:45:40,438
to take out a munitions dealer
named Daedalus...

584
00:45:40,511 --> 00:45:42,445
and his hired enforcer, Timothy.

585
00:45:42,513 --> 00:45:43,878
You failed
to complete your mission...

586
00:45:43,948 --> 00:45:47,406
electing instead to die, of all things,
despite clear orders to the contrary.

587
00:45:47,585 --> 00:45:51,180
Dead you remain.
Until without preamble...

588
00:45:51,355 --> 00:45:55,018
you reemerge eight years later
and a good deal frumpier.

589
00:45:59,096 --> 00:46:01,587
Anyhow, I think we can
safely assume...

590
00:46:02,533 --> 00:46:04,524
that Daedalus is aware
of your resurrection...

591
00:46:05,036 --> 00:46:06,867
and attempting to reverse it.

592
00:46:07,038 --> 00:46:11,372
He'll be watching the police, hospitals.
We must stay away, understand?

593
00:46:11,542 --> 00:46:13,066
Mr. Henessey, can I help you?

594
00:46:13,244 --> 00:46:14,939
Henessey, what is it?

595
00:46:15,112 --> 00:46:17,342
- It's a setup. It's got to be.
- Put that down.

596
00:46:18,449 --> 00:46:20,280
This is not an episode of television.

597
00:46:20,451 --> 00:46:22,385
Those guys
back at the train station.

598
00:46:22,553 --> 00:46:27,286
How'd they know we'd be there?
Lmpossible! Unless Waldman told them.

599
00:46:27,491 --> 00:46:29,618
- I did nothing of the kind.
- They tapped your phone.

600
00:46:29,827 --> 00:46:31,385
I know it sounds preposterous.

601
00:46:31,562 --> 00:46:33,120
Just happen to know we'd be calling?

602
00:46:33,197 --> 00:46:35,427
- Get in the car.
- All right.

603
00:46:35,499 --> 00:46:37,057
See here, my friend.

604
00:46:37,868 --> 00:46:39,358
Oh, shit!

605
00:46:44,542 --> 00:46:46,203
Get in the car, now!

606
00:46:53,918 --> 00:46:57,081
How about it? You believe
any of the crap that guy said?

607
00:46:57,254 --> 00:46:59,154
Well... no.

608
00:46:59,323 --> 00:47:01,154
That guy was a lunatic.

609
00:47:01,325 --> 00:47:03,259
We got to talk to someone else.

610
00:47:03,327 --> 00:47:05,192
You thinking what I'm thinking?

611
00:47:05,262 --> 00:47:08,095
I hope not because I'm thinking
how much my balls hurt.

612
00:47:08,332 --> 00:47:10,095
But if you're talking
about the postcard...

613
00:47:10,167 --> 00:47:12,692
I don't think I want to meet
any more of your old friends.

614
00:47:12,770 --> 00:47:14,533
We have no choice.

615
00:47:14,605 --> 00:47:17,005
We need some answers,
or we're gonna die.

616
00:47:50,641 --> 00:47:52,700
I saw you from the road.

617
00:47:55,146 --> 00:47:57,808
I think your name is Luke...

618
00:47:57,982 --> 00:48:00,678
and I think
I was going to marry you.

619
00:48:07,982 --> 00:48:08,778
Charly

620
00:48:10,227 --> 00:48:11,558
Oh, baby!

621
00:48:12,730 --> 00:48:14,061
Oh, man.

622
00:48:15,733 --> 00:48:16,722
Luke.

623
00:48:18,669 --> 00:48:20,569
She's my only daughter...

624
00:48:20,738 --> 00:48:22,535
and I don't quite trust you yet.

625
00:48:26,243 --> 00:48:27,505
So what about it?

626
00:48:27,678 --> 00:48:30,909
- You and Mr. Outdoors bump pelvises?
- It's possible.

627
00:48:31,081 --> 00:48:34,414
And how about your daughter?
What's her name, Cathead?

628
00:48:34,585 --> 00:48:37,748
- Caitlin.
- You think he might be the father?

629
00:48:38,355 --> 00:48:42,689
I don't know. But all these little
details about him are coming back.

630
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:45,522
- I'm remembering things.
- Like what?

631
00:48:45,696 --> 00:48:48,597
Is this "America's Funniest
Practical Videos" or something?

632
00:48:49,767 --> 00:48:51,758
Keep your fucking hands
where I can see them!

633
00:48:53,037 --> 00:48:54,402
I had an itch.

634
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:57,371
Charly, this is crazy.

635
00:48:57,541 --> 00:48:59,372
You and me, we were like...

636
00:49:03,614 --> 00:49:06,242
Don't you remember?
Hell, you pursued me.

637
00:49:07,885 --> 00:49:10,547
I know that he has a pin in his leg.
Car accident.

638
00:49:10,721 --> 00:49:12,450
I know he cuts his own hair.

639
00:49:12,523 --> 00:49:13,888
He doesn't own a TV.

640
00:49:14,058 --> 00:49:16,549
He sits down when he pees.

641
00:49:16,727 --> 00:49:18,456
That's enough.
I'm getting a boner.

642
00:49:18,629 --> 00:49:22,622
I know this man.
I must have been seeing him.

643
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,267
Let me talk to him.

644
00:49:24,435 --> 00:49:25,367
Alone.

645
00:49:29,473 --> 00:49:30,735
I'm sorry.

646
00:49:30,908 --> 00:49:32,398
Do you want to take a walk?

647
00:49:39,416 --> 00:49:41,407
Got me a handgun

648
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:45,149
Got a rifle too

649
00:49:47,157 --> 00:49:49,250
Anybody fuck with Mitch

650
00:49:49,426 --> 00:49:51,917
He know just what to do

651
00:49:52,162 --> 00:49:53,652
'Cause I'm a

652
00:49:53,931 --> 00:49:56,422
Bad motherfucker

653
00:49:57,401 --> 00:49:59,995
Stay quiet
and drop the rifle.

654
00:50:06,110 --> 00:50:07,338
How'd you find us?

655
00:50:07,511 --> 00:50:09,502
There may be many reasons
not to kill you...

656
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:11,946
but among them is not that
you'll be missed by NASA.

657
00:50:12,449 --> 00:50:14,508
I found the address
in your coat.

658
00:50:15,953 --> 00:50:18,683
Here. Between the address
of a topless bar...

659
00:50:18,856 --> 00:50:21,518
and a picture of what looks
like a man's penis.

660
00:50:21,692 --> 00:50:23,785
That's a duck, not a dick.

661
00:50:25,029 --> 00:50:27,190
The man she's with.
Who is he?

662
00:50:27,364 --> 00:50:29,855
Her former fiance.
His name's Luke.

663
00:50:30,034 --> 00:50:33,197
Former fiance? That's ridiculous.
She was never engaged.

664
00:50:33,370 --> 00:50:38,103
I just went through this with her.
She knows how the man pees.

665
00:50:38,309 --> 00:50:40,140
Look at him.
He's cool.

666
00:50:40,644 --> 00:50:42,305
Former fiance.

667
00:50:42,479 --> 00:50:45,380
- Why on earth would she think that?
- We found a note.

668
00:50:45,549 --> 00:50:46,880
It's in her handwriting.

669
00:50:47,051 --> 00:50:48,882
- She saw a note?
- Who are you, William Shatner?

670
00:50:49,019 --> 00:50:50,350
Calm down.

671
00:50:50,421 --> 00:50:52,616
- Yeah, a note to her uncle.
- Max?

672
00:50:54,725 --> 00:50:55,783
Uncle Max!

673
00:50:55,993 --> 00:50:58,154
That's the agency,
you blithering idiot!

674
00:50:58,228 --> 00:51:01,493
And the word "engaged" means
she's locked on to target. Fuck!

675
00:51:01,565 --> 00:51:03,556
- Not a former lover but a target?
- Her target, yes!

676
00:51:03,734 --> 00:51:06,396
She knows things because she studied
the bastard to assassinate him.

677
00:51:06,637 --> 00:51:07,535
Shit!

678
00:51:07,605 --> 00:51:10,130
- Sam!
- Charly!

679
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:11,538
He's Daedalus!

680
00:51:11,609 --> 00:51:14,772
Get out of there!
It's him!

681
00:51:49,146 --> 00:51:50,477
Well, howdy there.

682
00:51:50,748 --> 00:51:53,512
If it isn't the forgetful spy.
How you feeling?

683
00:51:54,852 --> 00:51:56,581
You're the man from the bar.

684
00:51:56,654 --> 00:51:58,986
Will you look at her.
She's not faking it.

685
00:51:59,056 --> 00:52:01,217
She doesn't know me from Adam.

686
00:52:01,291 --> 00:52:04,920
It's not that I don't trust
my compadre here, Major Baltimore.

687
00:52:05,763 --> 00:52:08,664
In fact, I had every confidence
that your amnesia was genuine.

688
00:52:09,366 --> 00:52:10,856
Until you showed up here.

689
00:52:11,201 --> 00:52:12,429
You follow?

690
00:52:13,203 --> 00:52:17,765
I'm trying to pull off
the biggest job of my career...

691
00:52:18,208 --> 00:52:19,698
so, darling,
I have to know...

692
00:52:20,110 --> 00:52:22,874
how much about me
you really remember.

693
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,271
And who you've told.

694
00:52:26,550 --> 00:52:28,882
I haven't told a soul.
I swear.

695
00:52:29,553 --> 00:52:31,043
We'll soon know.

696
00:52:34,058 --> 00:52:36,549
What is this?
Some kind of torture thing?

697
00:52:36,627 --> 00:52:37,958
Torture, yes.

698
00:52:38,696 --> 00:52:41,130
A woman's face never looks...

699
00:52:41,298 --> 00:52:43,892
quite so beautiful
as when it's distended in pain.

700
00:52:44,134 --> 00:52:45,396
Witness...

701
00:52:45,569 --> 00:52:47,230
the beauty of childbirth.

702
00:52:47,404 --> 00:52:49,201
Untie me,
and I'll make any face you want.

703
00:52:49,373 --> 00:52:50,635
Let's not and say we did.

704
00:52:51,775 --> 00:52:53,242
Take a deep breath.

705
00:52:53,477 --> 00:52:54,944
We're gonna do the torture thing.

706
00:53:31,582 --> 00:53:33,948
Operation Honeymoon
is on schedule.

707
00:53:34,118 --> 00:53:35,847
I've secured the tanker.

708
00:53:36,453 --> 00:53:38,011
Now I just got to make the soup.

709
00:53:38,188 --> 00:53:40,520
I'll follow as soon as
I'm done here.

710
00:53:42,292 --> 00:53:45,784
Ten minutes in this cold water,
she'll be insane or dead.

711
00:53:45,963 --> 00:53:48,454
Five minutes.
She'll tell me everything I need.

712
00:54:07,651 --> 00:54:11,314
That's right.
Take in all the air you can.

713
00:54:11,655 --> 00:54:13,987
If you need to vomit,
do it now.

714
00:54:14,224 --> 00:54:15,384
So you...

715
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:17,684
don't remember anything...

716
00:54:17,995 --> 00:54:19,223
at all?

717
00:54:19,830 --> 00:54:21,957
Best night of your fucking life.

718
00:54:23,567 --> 00:54:25,228
I say drown the wench.

719
00:54:27,070 --> 00:54:28,537
Talk to me, Major.

720
00:54:28,839 --> 00:54:30,500
Is my identity safe?

721
00:54:30,674 --> 00:54:33,006
My name is Samantha Caine.

722
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:37,512
Answer the question.

723
00:54:38,582 --> 00:54:39,913
Who knows about me?

724
00:54:40,083 --> 00:54:41,072
Nobody!

725
00:54:41,251 --> 00:54:42,513
Fuck you!

726
00:54:43,854 --> 00:54:45,151
Fuck you!

727
00:54:47,691 --> 00:54:49,750
I hate to see you like this, Charly.

728
00:54:53,063 --> 00:54:55,497
I heard you were
a hell of a spy once.

729
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:58,863
Watch your back.

730
00:54:59,603 --> 00:55:01,332
I'm not done yet.

731
00:55:01,505 --> 00:55:02,494
Goodnight.

732
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:34,293
Okay, I'll signal Daedalus.
Your money will be waiting.

733
00:55:35,739 --> 00:55:36,865
Jack...

734
00:55:40,310 --> 00:55:41,902
do yourself a favor, man.

735
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:43,740
Don't let her looks fool you.

736
00:55:43,914 --> 00:55:45,973
She's the fucking Energizer Bunny.

737
00:55:46,149 --> 00:55:48,140
Just do her and dump her.

738
00:55:48,318 --> 00:55:52,482
Don't get cute and play doctor first.
I made that mistake.

739
00:55:52,656 --> 00:55:53,884
Nearly killed me.
