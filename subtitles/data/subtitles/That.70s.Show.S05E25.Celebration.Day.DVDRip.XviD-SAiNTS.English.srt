Ah, my last American Popsicle
washed down by my last American grape soda.

2
00:00:15,548 --> 00:00:18,449
Fez, it's sad
you're getting deported...

3
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:21,510
but this "last American" crap's
getting annoying.

4
00:00:21,588 --> 00:00:24,182
Ah, my last American chance
to annoy you.

5
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:27,954
Hey. Come on, Fez.
Look on the bright side.

6
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,962
I mean, we graduate tomorrow.

7
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,294
You go to your country
with a high school diploma...

8
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:35,129
they'll probably make you, like,
head medicine man or something.

9
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:39,831
Eric, there is no bright side
about going back to a place...

10
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:42,067
where people
are outnumbered by lizards.

11
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:49,277
I'm gonna miss you, man.
When you get there, can you mail me a lizard?

12
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:52,216
- Eric, guess what came for you?
- Hey. They just send those to me.

13
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:55,015
I don't even find
those girls attractive.

14
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:58,387
No, you perv. It's the key
to our new apartment in Madison.

15
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:01,052
- Oh.
- Now we can leave tomorrow after
graduation like we wanted.

16
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:03,618
Great. By this time next week,
our new neighbors will be...

17
00:01:03,696 --> 00:01:06,961
hearing your cries of love
through our paper-thin walls.

18
00:01:07,033 --> 00:01:09,934
Cries of love?
Or cries of disappointment?

19
00:01:10,937 --> 00:01:12,928
Oh, I don't want to go.

20
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:15,566
Come on, Fez. It's not like we're never
gonna see you again.

21
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:17,667
I'm sure in a couple months
you'll be, like...

22
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:20,110
on the cover of <i>National Geographic.</i>

23
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:26,050
Yeah, those bastards
are always so intrusive.

24
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:30,846
Fez, look.
At least we're going camping tonight.

25
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,893
- We'll all be together for our last blowout.
- It won't be all of us.

26
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,088
Kelso can't make it on account
of he's got a broken face.

27
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:42,597
I don't got a broken face.

28
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:45,069
You will if you keep interfering with me
getting Jackie back.

29
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:47,470
You're the one that's interfering.

30
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:51,237
You know what? I'm going and Jackie's going,
and you're staying home.

31
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:53,472
- No. You are.
- No. You are.

32
00:01:53,546 --> 00:01:56,037
- Fine, stay home then.
- I will.

33
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:03,388
Hey, stop it. Would you please put aside
your differences and go camping with me?

34
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:06,016
We only have
a few hours left together.

35
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:08,492
- Fine. I'll go for you.
- Good.

36
00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:12,691
Now, I am off to spend the rest of my
American money on candy and porno.

37
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:17,202
- But, Fez-
- I said, candy and porno.

38
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:29,940
Hey, Jackie? You're gonna love
these cookies on the camping trip.

39
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:32,507
They're sweet and tasty,
just like me.

40
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:37,046
Kelso, this apple's
kind of like you too.

41
00:02:37,123 --> 00:02:38,886
You mean juicy and delicious?

42
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,450
- No. Red and bruised.
- Agh!

43
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,460
Yeah? Well, these hot dogs
are like you, too, Hyde.

44
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:49,991
They're, uh-

45
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:52,401
- Kosher.
- Yeah, kosher!

46
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:56,876
- Wait, what's kosher?
- That means blessed by a rabbi.

47
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:59,138
Burn!

48
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:03,008
Jackie, are you sure
you want to go camping?

49
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:05,516
These idiots are gonna be competing
over you the whole time.

50
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:08,554
Well, I am glad, Donna.
They've both jerked me around so much...

51
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:10,612
I cannot wait
to watch 'em fight over me.

52
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:14,023
You know, if you really want to mess
with them, you should do it with me.

53
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:18,428
Hey, talk about humiliating.

54
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,801
So, you guys are going
to the lake, huh?

55
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,803
It is real fun up there.

56
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,930
My senior year, I set the record...

57
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:30,373
for most topless rides
on the rope swing.

58
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:33,778
I wish I was goin'.

59
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:36,406
Yeah, don't even
think about it, Laurie.

60
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:39,042
There are enough scary things
in the woods already.

61
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:42,679
Eric, I'm being deported,
and she's loose with the boobs. She goes.

62
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:47,159
Hey, Forman. Your mom just came back
from the loony doctor.

63
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:50,287
She got real depressed when she heard
you guys were moving to Madison, huh?

64
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:52,661
Yeah, you're tellin' me.
Last night she was making sounds...

65
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,666
that were giving my dad
war flashbacks.

66
00:03:57,337 --> 00:04:00,898
What a beautiful day.

67
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:06,640
I feel- I feel like a rainbow.

68
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:12,175
Anyone else feel like a rainbow?

69
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:15,688
- What happened to her?

72
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,333
I wrote that just for you, Jackie.

73
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:03,869
He didn't write that.
He ripped it off from "American Pie."

74
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:07,030
Nah-uh.
The "American Pie" guy ripped me off.

75
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:09,768
- You shut up, man.
- You shut up!

76
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:13,744
Okay. I'm gonna freak everyone out
and tell my ghost story...

77
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:16,873
so go hide in the woods
and jump out when I get to the end.

78

[British Accent]
You are as wicked as you are gorgeous.

79
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:27,084
You know, it really creeps me out being up
here after what happened to those kids.

80
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,424
What kids?

81
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:35,300
A bunch of kids just like us were
camping out up here...

82
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:37,598
and they disappeared.

83
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:41,504
And all the police could find were these
bloody drag marks that led down to the lake.

84
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:43,633
<i>It was like-</i>

85
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,736
It was like something killed them
and then pulled them in.

86
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:49,782
Maybe it was the Loch Ness Monster.

87
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:56,786
No. Fez, the Loch Ness Monster's
in Africa.

88
00:05:56,856 --> 00:06:00,257
So the police, like, searched the lake
with their sonar and stuff...

89
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:02,260
and when they
played back the tapes...

90
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:05,456
all they could hear in the background was,
like, a whisper.

91
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,761
What did it say?

92
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:12,096
"I am the Lady of the Lake.

93
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:15,163
<i>I am the Lady of the Lake. "

94
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:19,439
Yeah. And you'll know when she's coming,
because she screams before she kills.

95
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:21,810
Let's see if we can hear her.

96
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:31,155
I said, let's see
if we can hear her.

<i>[Eric]</i>
<i>D- Donna, I'm stuck in a thornbush.</i>

98
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:40,660
I heard her.
She's stuck in a thornbush.

99
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:44,903
I'm kind of cold.

100
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:47,565
I'll reward who ever
gets more firewood...

101
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,905
by letting them
feed me marshmallows.

102
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:53,969
I'm not gonna go running around
the woods trying to impress you.

103
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:57,709
I will.

104
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:03,519
Damn it.

105
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,853
I'm gonna go take a walk
down to the lake.

106
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:11,162
[Thinking]
She's going to the lake, old boy.

107
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,824
That means topless rope-swinging.

108
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:18,701
Now, do you want to spend your last hours
in America eating s'mores?

109
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:24,141
Or watching her glorious breasts
swinging in the chilly night air?

110
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:27,608
I choose boobs.

111
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:34,316
This is so strange, you know?
It's, like, our last night all together.

112
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:37,447
It's too weird to think about.
Let's, like, do something to get our minds off it.

113
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:41,891
Well, here's the tent.

114
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:45,192
So, I'll tell you what. I'll go inside,
strip down and just lay there-

115
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:48,825
Let's go skinny-dipping.
Meet me down by the lake in five minutes.

116
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:51,699
Wait, so-

117
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:55,867
I have to walk all the way down
to the lake by myself?

118
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:58,911
Yeah.

119
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,912
That's cool.

120
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:06,945
Here you go, Kitty.
Home sweet home.

121
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:11,821
I went into my closet
to get a jacket.

122
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:14,792
I found Kitty standin' in there.

123
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:21,362
I like the way
the coats felt on my arms.

124
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,668
Oh, yes.

Hey, Laurie, are you naked,
or you just happy to see me?

00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:40,012

I just ran away.

Yeah? Well,
I've got bigger problems.

144
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:58,419
Fez is a good artist.
He's gonna paint me onto a nudie poster...

00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:30,258
Man, that one
guitar-shaped log is roarin'.

153
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:34,591
What the- Is that my guitar?

154
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:38,661
Yep. It's got a nice, warm sound.

155
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:42,640
<i>- Dead!</i>
- Back off, man. Jackie doesn't want you.

156
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:45,142
Yeah? She still has
feelings for me and you know it!

157
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:48,009
Okay, okay, okay. Stop it!
This isn't fun for me anymore!

158
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,514
What?
What do you mean fun for you?

159
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:53,779
I didn't say that.

160
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:57,846
Yeah, you did. All right.
What are you trying to do?

161
00:10:57,923 --> 00:11:00,687
You're getting your kicks off of watching us
jump through hoops over you.

162
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,751
No. We didn't jump through hoops.

163
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:05,023
I'm good at that.
I would have won that.

164
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,197
All right. I'm done with this crap, Jackie.
You choose right now. Me or him.

165
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,670
Yeah, who's it gonna be?

166
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:15,798
- Wait. What? No. L-
- What's the matter? You don't know?

167
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,866
No, I don't know.

168
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:25,143
Wow. Drama.

169
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:31,555
I know. For a second there I almost forgot
about my sister's wet, naked ass.

170
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:33,819
Oh, God!

171
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:39,025
Yeah, where is Laurie?
And where's Fez?

172
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,974
That was incredible, huh?

173
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:56,908
It was okay.

174
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,041
Okay's good enough for me.

175
00:12:16,582 --> 00:12:19,949
Wow. Yeah, I don't know
if it's the mountain air...

176
00:12:20,018 --> 00:12:22,077
or the poison from that thornbush...

177
00:12:22,154 --> 00:12:24,987
but... I slept great.

178
00:12:26,825 --> 00:12:28,759
Oh, my God.
It's almost 10:30.

179
00:12:28,827 --> 00:12:30,988
We're late for graduation.

180
00:12:59,558 --> 00:13:01,583
Wait, wait.
Guys?

181
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,787
Guys, where's the van?

182
00:13:03,862 --> 00:13:05,796
I think it's obvious, Jackie.

183
00:13:05,864 --> 00:13:09,356
The Lady of the Lake stole it.

184
00:13:09,434 --> 00:13:13,131
- Why would a ghost need a van?
- What's she gonna do, hitch a ride?

185
00:13:14,139 --> 00:13:16,266
Who's gonna pick up a ghost?

186
00:13:16,341 --> 00:13:19,003
And you're telling me
you can't decide between us?

187
00:13:20,112 --> 00:13:22,603
Oh, my God.
Fez and Laurie.

188
00:13:22,681 --> 00:13:26,014
- They probably took it to mess with us.
- Aw, man. I'm gonna kill 'em.

189
00:13:26,084 --> 00:13:29,679
Eric, if I'm right about the Lady of the Lake,
and I think I am...

190
00:13:31,089 --> 00:13:33,080
they might already be dead.

191
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:38,862
I can't believe those morons
missed their own graduation.

192
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:43,162
My whole life I waited to hear
the Pinciotti name called at graduation.

193
00:13:44,336 --> 00:13:47,533
When they skipped
from Olendorff to Stevens...

194
00:13:47,606 --> 00:13:50,336
a little part of me died.

195
00:13:52,311 --> 00:13:54,472
Come on.
Let's get you a hoagie.

196
00:13:56,748 --> 00:13:58,682
Kitty.

197
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:02,777
We've got to have a little conversation
about those pills you're taking.

198
00:14:02,854 --> 00:14:06,290
These things?
I think they're working wonders.

199
00:14:06,358 --> 00:14:08,758
You know, I didn't cry once
when Eric got his diploma.

200
00:14:08,827 --> 00:14:11,125
I just smiled and took his picture.

201
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:14,064
That wasn't Eric.

202
00:14:14,132 --> 00:14:17,829
That was some skinny girl
with a Dorothy Hamill haircut.

203
00:14:18,904 --> 00:14:20,997
But it's not fair, Red.

204
00:14:21,073 --> 00:14:25,009
You-You teach your children how to-
how to walk, to-to use a fork...

205
00:14:25,077 --> 00:14:28,444
to-to look both ways
before crossing the street...

206
00:14:28,513 --> 00:14:31,505
and then one day you realize
all you're doing is teaching them how to leave.

207
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:34,381
We should never
have potty-trained him.

208
00:14:34,453 --> 00:14:37,422
Listen, Kitty.
We did the kid thing...

209
00:14:37,489 --> 00:14:40,890
and it was... great.

210
00:14:42,461 --> 00:14:46,363
But now I'm looking forward
to it just being the two of us again.

211
00:14:46,431 --> 00:14:48,558
This is our time.

212
00:14:48,633 --> 00:14:50,692
Let's enjoy it.

213
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:59,807
You're right, Red. I don't need those.
[Laughs]

214
00:14:59,878 --> 00:15:03,939
Whenever I feel like I'm on the verge of a
nervous breakdown, I'll just come talk to you.

215
00:15:05,917 --> 00:15:09,444
And I'll just give you one of these.

216
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:16,093
Wow. What a great day.

217
00:15:16,161 --> 00:15:19,028
Not only did we get
to miss our own graduation...

218
00:15:19,097 --> 00:15:22,260
but we got to ride home
in the back of a pig truck.

219
00:15:23,635 --> 00:15:25,569
Yeah, when we went
around a corner...

220
00:15:25,637 --> 00:15:28,162
one of those pigs almost
went to third base on me.

221
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,174
You know what?
I need a shower.

222
00:15:30,242 --> 00:15:32,176
Hang on.
You're not going anywhere.

223
00:15:32,244 --> 00:15:34,906
- You haven't given us an answer yet.
- Yeah. Who's it gonna be?

224
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:38,211
You know what?
I can't talk about love right now.

225
00:15:38,283 --> 00:15:40,683
The bottom of my jeans have
something brown on them.

226
00:15:43,989 --> 00:15:48,892
- Where the hell have you been?
- I have waited 18 years for my graduation picture.

227
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:53,192
I want you all back here at 5:00 sharp
in your caps and gowns, ready to say cheese.

228
00:15:53,265 --> 00:15:55,733
Is that clear?

229
00:15:55,801 --> 00:15:58,269
- Fine.
- Fine.
- Yes, Mom.

230
00:15:58,336 --> 00:16:03,831
Hey? What kind of a moron leaves
the keys <i>in</i> the ignition?

231
00:16:03,909 --> 00:16:09,438
When I put the keys in my pocket,
it distracts from my natural bulge. God!

232
00:16:21,259 --> 00:16:24,057
You guys, I've been thinking about Steven
and Michael all day...

233
00:16:24,129 --> 00:16:26,097
and I don't know who to pick.

234
00:16:26,164 --> 00:16:28,860
Face facts, Jackie.
There's only one good man in this town...

235
00:16:28,934 --> 00:16:31,095
and, well, he's leaving.

236
00:16:33,638 --> 00:16:35,936
Eric, this is really hard.

237
00:16:36,007 --> 00:16:41,843
I mean, okay. I know I love Steven
because he's smart, and he's deep...

238
00:16:41,913 --> 00:16:44,575
and when we have conversation
he makes me think.

239
00:16:44,649 --> 00:16:47,618
Which used to give me a headache,
but now I really like.

240
00:16:49,788 --> 00:16:54,157
- So, go with Hyde.
- Yeah, but Michael.

241
00:16:54,226 --> 00:16:58,856
Oh, Michael is so beautiful.

242
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:02,957
And you spend a lot more time looking
at someone than you do talking to them.

243
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:08,706
Again, go with Hyde.

244
00:17:08,773 --> 00:17:11,435
No, but, Donna,
you don't understand.

245
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:14,604
Look, I know in a lot of ways
I need Steven.

246
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:17,204
But Michael needs me.

247
00:17:17,282 --> 00:17:19,910
And it's nice to be needed.

248
00:17:19,985 --> 00:17:22,283
You know what, Jackie?

249
00:17:22,354 --> 00:17:24,515
In order to help you, and-

250
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:26,750
well, just to speed
this thing up-

251
00:17:26,825 --> 00:17:30,386
I, uh- I think you should
just take everything and toss it aside...

252
00:17:30,462 --> 00:17:34,626
and ask yourself,
who do you love the most?

253
00:17:37,435 --> 00:17:40,404
You're right. You're right.
That's what I should do-

254
00:17:40,472 --> 00:17:43,339
- Because I'm-
- No, no. Not here. Not here.

255
00:17:44,943 --> 00:17:47,639
Yeah, that's-Yeah, just-

256
00:17:49,814 --> 00:17:53,272
More dishes? I
thought we already loaded these.

257
00:17:59,357 --> 00:18:02,326
You had to bring
the <i>Millennium Falcon?</i>

258
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:15,567
Son, here's 10 bucks for gas.

259
00:18:17,509 --> 00:18:19,443
No way. Thanks.

260
00:18:19,511 --> 00:18:21,809
Well, I just want
to make sure that you get out.

261
00:18:23,515 --> 00:18:27,076
I mean, that you get, um,
all the way there.

262
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:30,849
Hey, guys, I made a decision.

263
00:18:30,922 --> 00:18:34,858
So who's it gonna be?
"Tall and hot" or "short and kosher"?

264
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:40,825
Would you shut the hell up
and let her talk?

265
00:18:40,899 --> 00:18:44,528
Okay, look. I had to ask myself
a really hard question.

266
00:18:44,603 --> 00:18:46,662
Who do I love most?

267
00:18:46,738 --> 00:18:50,139
And the answer was so obvious.
It was staring me in the face the whole time.

268
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:53,041
The person I love most is me.

269
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,405
I love me most.

270
00:18:57,482 --> 00:19:00,144
You choose you?

271
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:05,621
Look, if I could run across the beach
into my own arms, I would.

272
00:19:09,027 --> 00:19:11,518
Wait, what-
So where does that leave us?

273
00:19:11,596 --> 00:19:15,032
I'll figure that out after
I spend the summer by the pool.

274
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:18,968
I feel this would be a lot clearer
when I'm much tanner.

275
00:19:22,674 --> 00:19:24,904
What a bunch of crap, man.

276
00:19:24,976 --> 00:19:28,639
You know, freakin' girls.
If it wasn't for the soft skin, the legs...

277
00:19:28,713 --> 00:19:32,649
the eyes, the long fingernails, the butts
and the boobs, I wouldn't even talk to 'em.

278
00:19:34,285 --> 00:19:36,446
All right. All right.
Picture time.

279
00:19:36,521 --> 00:19:38,546
Everybody get in front of the car.

280
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:41,114
Hey, Forman, I got you a plant
for your new apartment...

281
00:19:41,192 --> 00:19:44,059
- but, um, I can't give it to you
in front of your parents.
- Oh!

282
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:52,602
Okay, here we go.
One, two-

283
00:19:52,671 --> 00:19:57,165
- Guys, I have something to tell you.
- Just talk while you pose.

284
00:19:57,242 --> 00:20:01,303
Kitty, be sure to get me in the background
loadin' the last bunch of Eric's crap.

285
00:20:01,379 --> 00:20:05,042
- Aw, man.
- Okay, here we go. Smile.

287
00:20:11,322 --> 00:20:13,847
Okay, tell them Laurie.

288
00:20:13,925 --> 00:20:16,519
I married Fez so he could stay
in the country!

You did what?

291
00:20:30,442 --> 00:20:35,505
Don't worry, Daddy. I don't love him.
I was just bored.

00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:38,913
Yeah, but we will be
