1
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,640
You're lost.

2
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,680
I'm not lost.
I just don't know exactly where we are.

3
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,280
Maybe I should steer for a while.

4
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,680
Whoa. I'm a little buzzed.

5
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,360
Man, you are so cute
when you're hammered.

6
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:24,200
- I'm not hammered.
- You sure are.

7
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,080
Hey, look.

8
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,200
I'm busy here.

9
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,760
Land.

10
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:04,360
You see? We're not lost, we're just
on some creepy island penal colony.

11
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,720
You know what?
I'm gonna go and find that bar.

12
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,040
- Ok.
- Ok.

13
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,920
- Woof!

14
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,960
Woof!

15
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,600
Hey, wait up!
I've just gotta finish tying up here.

16
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,080
Ow!

17
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,320
Hello?

18
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,480
Hello?

19
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,000
Luke?

20
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,720
Jenny?

21
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,680
Jen?

22
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,240
There it is.

23
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,800
- What?
- There it is! You excited?

24
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,800
Three final exams, two biology labs
and a term paper due in four days

25
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,680
and I let you convince me to go
for a party weekend.

26
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,000
It's my duty
as the irresponsible brother.

27
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,360
To make sure I never get
into medical school?

28
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,960
The burden of the smart guy!

29
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,840
I got two words for you -
Communications Major.

30
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,840
I'm a fan of the five-year program.

31
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,640
This is why I had to study
in the library.

32
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:20,160
Noah has turned our dorm room
into prime happy-hour real estate.

33
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:24,760
Because I read the brochure that said
it's Ok to have fun in college.

34
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:28,400
- I have fun!
- You have fun, when?

35
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,760
Baby, you'll have the last laugh
when you're a doctor...

36
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:36,080
and they're stuck living off of ramen
noodles and unemployment cheques.

37
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,600
Oh!

38
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,960
- That's not a bad thing.
- Bill Gates never went to college!

39
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,080
Just fly the plane, Maverick.

40
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,920
Gosh, Mattie, this place is incredible.
I can't believe it's yours.

41
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,760
Ours. It's "ours."

42
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,960
God, it must really suck
being a trust-fund baby, huh?

43
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,840
When my uncle died,
I only got Sonics season tickets.

44
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,280
Our Uncle Frank wasn't rich.
This house was all he owned.

45
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,800
- Lived here for... what?
- 20 years.

46
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:22,480
...20 years, doing nothing but studying
birds, watching animals...

47
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,360
Talking to trees, guzzling whisky.

48
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,560
Yeah, he was a little eccentric.

49
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,120
Johnny and our uncle
never really got each other.

50
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,400
- No one ever gets me.
- I got you.

51
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,480
You got me so much,
you dropped my ass.

52
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,480
Hey...

53
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,800
- Come on.
- Oh. Sorry, man.

54
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,240
Overgrown chic! I love it.

55
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,720
Come on, let's get inside.

56
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,240
Man, I missed this place, Johnny.

57
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,720
Ah, the zip line.
I'm going on that.

58
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,560
Here we are.
Home sweet home, huh?

59
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,400
- I love it!
- Wow!

60
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,400
How long has it been
since you guys were here?

61
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:27,240
God, ten... How old were you when
you sunk Uncle Frank's car in the bay?

62
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,440
I was 12 and bored.

63
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,600
12. So... 13 years.

64
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:36,440
I'm surprised he left us the place.
He was afraid you'd burn it down.

65
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,520
- I still can.
- Poor house.

66
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,320
Check out the wine cellar.
Whoa!

67
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:45,520
- An M5 Medoc? God, this is fancy!
- Yes, yes!

68
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,800
In M5 I was still playing
with Rainbow Brite.

69
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,360
Yeah? And looking good doing it.

70
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,520
- We can't get into his wine, it's...
- What?

71
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,400
It's... I don't know.
It's disrespectful or something.

72
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,440
You know what? Let's all be quiet.

73
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,760
Lucky for you guys I came prepared.

74
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,440
- What you got?
- Anybody know what time it is?

75
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,120
- What time is it?
- What time is it?

76
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,400
Margarita-30!

77
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,080
Where's the blender?
Come on, baby.

78
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,960
Chips, salsa...

79
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,800
hot dogs, beer...

80
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:42,040
Soy milk? Flaxseed oil? Kasha?
What the hell is kasha?

81
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,520
That's Nikki's. She's a health-food nut.

82
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,120
Her body looks like no vegetarian
I've ever seen.

83
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,320
Ooh!

84
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,160
Have a good time.
Don't be a little vagina this weekend.

85
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:58,320
Ok, that's offensive, A,
and B, I am gonna have a good time.

86
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:02,280
- You still remember how to do this?
- Yes. Go.

87
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,520
Ah, the memories.

88
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,080
The car that was once a submarine.

89
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,800
Give the nozzle a turn.
If you smell gas, run.

90
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,440
Thank you.

91
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,120
Hey, look. The keys are still in the car.

92
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,960
That thing hasn't been used for ages.
It's never gonna start.

93
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,480
Given your history,
it's probably a good thing.

94
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,280
German engineering at its finest.

95
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,200
Come on! Oh! Oh...

96
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,880
What's wrong?

97
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,640
The only thing separating me
from my immediate personal happiness

98
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,040
is John and Matt's skill
with a generator.

99
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,280
Then we'd better start drinking
these... before they go...

100
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:58,000
Yes! That's what I'm talking about!
That's what...

101
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,200
Why, blender?

102
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,680
- What happened?
- What do we do?

103
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,640
I saw the fuse box in the basement.

104
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,440
- You know how to fix a fuse?
- Hell, no. You?

105
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,960
- No!
- Well...

106
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,880
maybe we could figure it out together.

107
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,480
Ok, Ok...

108
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:33,000
a young, handsome brother...

109
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:38,280
...takes blonde little bad girl

110
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:42,760
into the dark, dusty basement with him.

111
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,280
- I got it.
- Ok, you go ahead.

112
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:51,000
Young... attractive... virgin...

113
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,640
pushes obnoxious
asshole in the basement!

114
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,680
Are you really a virgin?

115
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,720
Wouldn't you like to know?
Er... yes.

116
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,680
Ooh! Vintage.

117
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,800
Here's the fuse box.

118
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,920
- Look, there's the fuse.
- New one?

119
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,720
Yeah... Oh. You see?
That one's blown.

120
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,200
- This one?
- Yeah.

121
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,240
- Sorry.
- Dude!

122
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,960
It was this thing! I'm sorry!

123
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,240
- You scared?
- No. Where is this?

124
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:02,080
- Oh! Got it! Got the fuse.
- Yeah.

125
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,880
- Should I put it in?
- Oh, God, yeah.

126
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,600
Eugh!

127
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,040
- Ok, here's the master switch.
- Ok, try it.

128
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,240
- Ready?
- Yeah... Yes!

129
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,640
- You weren't supposed to find that.
- Why?

130
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:38,160
It's just a secret attic
for make-out parties.

131
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,560
You were nine the last time
you came here, silly.

132
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,240
And?

133
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,800
I was a very early bloomer.

134
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:57,120
If everybody knew the Matt that I know,
it'd be so hard to keep you to myself.

135
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,240
No, it wouldn't.

136
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,040
Which room should we take?

137
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,440
The one farthest from my brother's?

138
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,560
Ideal.

139
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,880
Two years and it's still awkward.

140
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:22,080
I apologised to him a thousand times
about us, but he's still mad.

141
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,960
He's not mad, he's John.

142
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,880
Are you trying to fulfil
some adolescent fantasies?

143
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,400
I might be.

144
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,760
Uh-uh. There.

145
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:39,240
- A secret make-out party.
- Uh-oh.

146
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,480
It's on!

147
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:51,120
You know you're gonna kill
yourself.

148
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,360
You'll never believe what I found
in the attic.

149
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,960
Ah.

150
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:02,040
Ah, the house flag.
We were such dorks.

151
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,160
At least one of us has changed, huh?

152
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:08,080
- That rope's gotta be 20 years old.
- It feels Ok to me.

153
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,640
John, really.
Hemp like that deteriorates.

154
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:17,200
I brought climbing rope with me.
You can string it with a Dynaloc.

155
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,120
Whoo!

156
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:24,680
- Once a brute, always a brute.
- Whoo!

157
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,760
Sometimes it stuns me
that you two are related.

158
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,080
Usually people who live
on the edge like that die young.

159
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,840
Johnny wouldn't be caught dead dying.

160
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,760
It would make him look bad.

161
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,040
What? All work and no play.

162
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,080
You sound like Johnny.

163
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,960
Well, he wants you
to enjoy yourself too.

164
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,520
- Right.
- He does.

165
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:22,240
Remember when we were 13 and he
threw you your first boy-girl party?

166
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,880
- When your mum went out of town?
- I do.

167
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,280
And we played Truth or Dare

168
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,840
and watched, er... What was that called?

169
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,520
"Wild On lbiza"?

170
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,200
- And he dared you to kiss me.
- And I did.

171
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,120
Then I cried.

172
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,200
I don't think my male ego
ever recovered from that.

173
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,800
I think you're doing just fine.

174
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,760
- You think?
- Yeah...

175
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,560
Have fun, Ok?

176
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,320
- Did you ever...
- No.

177
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,840
We've been friends for a long time,
plus I got with too many of her girls.

178
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:07,400
- Too many! What's too many?
- For a chick, any is...

179
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,360
- Any is too many?
- Any is too many.

180
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,360
Hi!

181
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:27,440
- Ok...

182
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,600
Whoa!

183
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,160
Nice shot, Robin Hood.
That's so white of you.

184
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,640
- You wanna give it a shot?
- What?

185
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,240
- Do you wanna try?
- Er... no.

186
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,840
All right.

187
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,120
See? It's that easy.

188
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,520
You guys hear that?

189
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,960
Oh, my God.

190
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,160
It's so cute.

191
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,880
Where is it from?

192
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,840
- You better leave that thing alone.
- Can I see it?

193
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,000
He just peed on you.

194
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,960
It's a boy.

195
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:24,800
- It can't be more than 8 or 9 weeks old.
- You go, Dr. Ruth.

196
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,400
What kind of dog is that?

197
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:32,280
Well, it looks like a German Shepherd,
but he's big. Really big.

198
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,680
I thought we were the only ones
on the island.

199
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,560
He was probably abandoned
by some boaters.

200
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,320
Hey, guys, I have an idea. Hold on!

201
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,200
Ssh! I have an idea, a good idea.

202
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,000
- Let's eat him.
- You're such a dick.

203
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,480
I'm serious.
We'll put him on the target...

204
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,200
I got my iPod. Please, please.

205
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,840
Here's to that!

206
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,920
You like it here, huh?

207
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,680
Let's keep him with us tonight,
you guys.

208
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,560
You like it here?

209
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,160
Wait, wait. No TV,

210
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,560
no phone, no Maxim?

211
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,040
Some people like a break
from civilisation.

212
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,960
All right. Sure. I'm for the whole
kumbaya-granola thing,

213
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,680
as long as when it's over,

214
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:29,720
there's a fifth of Jager
and internet porn waiting for me.

215
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,160
Noah, sometimes it amazes
me that you're still single.

216
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:37,880
Here's to being single, seeing double,
sleeping triple...

217
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:42,080
- and to multiple orgasms.
- Yeah, by yourself.

218
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,200
Ooh!

219
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,920
Oh!

220
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,080
What's that in the cellar?
You hear that?

221
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:58,480
- Is that an M5 Medoc calling me?
- Yes.

222
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:02,160
You are gonna drink the cheap stuff
and you are gonna like it.

223
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,800
You are a cruel, cruel man.
But I still love you.

224
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:17,960
Uh-uh. That cute stuff's
not gonna work on me.

225
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,160
I'm a cat person.

226
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:31,400
Cheap enough?
That little sucker growled at me.

227
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,680
You piss on that rug, you're dead.

228
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,240
Hey!

229
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,840
He was just kidding! Come back!

230
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,560
Meanies.

231
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,200
That dog is weird. He just growled at me
for no good reason.

232
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,560
I said I liked cats.
I wasn't talking about the musical.

233
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,040
This little dog is harmless.
Chicken.

234
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:54,040
Don't worry, he'll come back.
He knows there's food here.

235
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,760
You wanna find him?

236
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,640
- I wanted to sleep with him.
- You were sleeping with me!

237
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,520
She was gonna make love to me
and then sleep in your bed.

238
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,040
That's Ok.

239
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,880
I see cancer patients every Thursday.
That's my charity work for the week.

240
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:10,440
Oh! Funny!

241
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,920
The folks got jokes tonight.
You all want some?

242
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:23,080
Here, pup. Where are you?

243
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,760
- You see him?
- Uh-uh.

244
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,760
This is bringing me back memories

245
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,000
from Ghost in the Graveyard.
Remember? When we were ten?

246
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,920
I don't remember that.

247
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,120
- Yeah, you were too cool back then.
- I'm still too cool.

248
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,480
- Right.
- Over there. There he is.

249
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:47,720
Hey, pup, there you are.
There you are! Come here.

250
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,120
Sara!

251
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,800
You Ok?

252
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,640
Here.

253
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,200
Ok?

254
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,520
It bit me.

255
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,640
All right, you're Ok.

256
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:37,680
You're Ok. Come on, let's go.

257
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,720
It just attacked you, unprovoked?

258
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,680
Yeah. Came out of nowhere.

259
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,040
It was probably just protecting
its young

260
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:50,640
but the rules say you gotta treat
any bite by an unknown animal

261
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,440
as a possible rabies infection.

262
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,920
But listen, you will not get rabies.
I know what I'm talking about.

263
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:01,000
There isn't a single case
of somebody who's gone through

264
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,840
a proper post-exposure treatment
who's then contracted the disease.

265
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:08,560
Isn't that where they gotta stick
a bunch of needles under your skin?

266
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,800
It's a little simpler than that.

267
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,840
- A little simpler?
- I think we should get the plane ready.

268
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:18,080
- You wanna leave?
- We should get Sara to a doctor.

269
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:23,160
Remember when I got that rabies shot
cos of that bat in the Bahamas?

270
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,560
You don't have to start right away.

271
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,960
- You really don't, if you're feeling Ok.
- Is that true?

272
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,360
As long as you have your first shot
within a week, yes.

273
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,560
But... there's no pressure.

274
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:40,600
Well, then I'm cool.
I'll be fine, you guys.

275
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,240
- She's fine.
- Sara?

276
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,640
Mattie, the point of this weekend
was for you to live a little,

277
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,440
so don't use this as an excuse.
That's bullshit.

278
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:53,760
Yeah, it's true, I'm fine. I mean, really.
It was scary!

279
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,880
Nothing that a little drinking can't cure.

280
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,240
Could someone give me a drink?
I need a drink.

281
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,360
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. Sure I'm sure.

282
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,760
What are you thinking about?

283
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,200
There was this company
who leased some land

284
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,960
on the other side of the island,
a couple of miles away.

285
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:01,840
Anyway, they built a compound
for training dogs.

286
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:05,400
When I was little, my uncle
used to walk me over there

287
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:08,640
and we'd play with all
the little puppies.

288
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:12,000
I think that's when I decided
I wanted to be a vet.

289
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,240
About a year ago...

290
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,640
...one of the dogs got rabies.

291
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:24,760
It started spreading
and all the dogs got it,

292
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,920
and my uncle told me
they had to put them down.

293
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,640
- That's horrible.
- Mmm.

294
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,800
So I assumed
they had been killed, but...

295
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:44,240
...after seeing that dog today...

296
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:49,600
So you think some of them survived?

297
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,000
That's just it.

298
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:56,120
If they had rabies and escaped, they
would've been dead a long time ago.

299
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,840
In dogs, rabies is always fatal.

300
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,640
So, what are you saying?

301
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,160
I don't know.

302
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,760
Oh!

303
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,040
Sorry. I didn't see you.

304
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,440
What are you doing?

305
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,560
I couldn't sleep.

306
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:50,120
- You?
- Me, neither.

307
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,000
You look like an angel.

308
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,360
Ow! Damn it!

309
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,760
Easy, tiger.

310
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,360
Go away.

311
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,640
Go away.

312
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,720
So, how about doing
some swimming today?

313
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,600
Maybe hang out by the dock?

314
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,920
Maybe when your leg feels better?

315
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,280
I'm fine.

316
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:25,360
How did I wind up dating
an outdoorsy type?

317
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,000
I don't know. I think it's
a lot better than living in a library.

318
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:35,520
I'm outdoorsy as long as
beautiful women in thongs are involved.

319
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:39,160
Do you ever get tired
of making an ass of yourself?

320
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,120
Not really. I figure
it's a part of my charm.

321
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:46,360
Yo. Excuse me.

322
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,480
I'm still hungry.

323
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,920
- Knock yourself out.
- I'll make more.

324
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,120
No, that's cool.

325
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,240
- Morning, guys.
- Good morning.

326
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,320
Boys and their toys.

327
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,760
I thought I'd take a walk in the woods
and find something to shoot.

328
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,800
I hope you mean something inanimate.

329
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,600
- Gosh, no, I thought I'd hunt for Bambi.
- Just checking.

330
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:14,840
I'm gonna come with you. I haven't
been around the island for years.

331
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,440
- You guys wanna come?
- Noah, come on.

332
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,320
Yeah. Yeah, why not?

333
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,360
Enjoy your breakfast.

334
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:30,000
Actually, I think I'm gonna stay here.

335
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,560
I'm not keen on that dog running around.

336
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:37,000
- Ok. We'll be careful.
- Keep him away from Thumper, too.

337
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,080
Come on.

338
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,640
No deer. No droppings.

339
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,160
You hear anything?

340
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,880
No.

341
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,560
It makes you wonder
where all the animals are.

342
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,840
Are you guys trying
to freak me out or something?

343
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:12,760
Is this like a game you play?
What?

344
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:16,040
- No, I'm serious.
- He's referring to inanimate animals.

345
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,960
You think Sara is feeling Ok?

346
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,480
I hope so.

347
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,040
- She's looking pretty good these days.
- Don't.

348
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,960
- What?
- Don't go there.

349
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,880
Why not?

350
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,800
She's obviously into me, so why
shouldn't I just go for it?

351
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,200
- Really?
- Yeah.

352
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,400
Because I've seen
how you treat women.

353
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,800
Because you're good
at saving them

354
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,560
doesn't always mean I'm the one
that ruins them.

355
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:53,320
- Brother in love.
- It's all right, man.

356
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,800
- Are you feeling all right?
- Yeah.

357
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,880
Are you sure?

358
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,960
I made out with John.

359
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,840
- So that's what's bothering you?
- Kind of, yeah.

360
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,760
- Why?
- Nice.

361
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:13,760
I don't know. I guess I thought
the rabies was settling in.

362
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:17,480
Very funny.
No, actually, I feel fine.

363
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,720
I feel great. I've got like this
adrenaline inside.

364
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,320
From John kissing you?

365
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,400
- Maybe.
- Well, might as well.

366
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:31,120
- You've liked him since you were 14.
- How did you know?

367
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:34,000
Who doesn't know that?
Everybody knows.

368
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,800
Oh, really?

369
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:39,560
Ok, then I hate everybody
right now.

370
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,840
Any day, Mcknight!

371
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,160
Can a brother not get
some alone time?

372
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,240
Damn!

373
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,720
Nice doggy.

374
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,360
Nice doggy.

375
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,440
Good boy.

376
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,480
Oh!

377
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:40,360
Ok, Ok...
It's fine. It's fine.

378
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:47,560
John! Matt! Hey!

379
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,120
Oh! Oh!

380
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,920
Oh!

381
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:06,360
- What happened?
- What are you doing?

382
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:09,400
The dogs on this island
are not friendly!

383
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:12,000
- You afraid of a dog?
- No, dogs, man. Plural.

384
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,600
- How many?
- Three, but it sounded like more.

385
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:19,000
You hear that?

386
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,200
You believe me now?

387
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,720
Oh!

388
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,880
They don't want you here.

389
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,080
The dogs, they don't want you here.

390
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,480
Help!

391
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,120
- Get back!
- We gotta help him!

392
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,080
What's up?

393
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,840
Nothing.

394
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,240
The house.

395
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,280
- Hey!
- Go to the house.

396
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,720
- What?
- Here they come.

397
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,640
What?

398
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,640
Run!

399
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:45,120
- Run to the house!
- Oh, my God! Run!

400
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,520
Run! Hurry up!

401
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:53,760
Come on, you guys!
Hurry up!

402
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,200
Hey!

403
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,240
Mattie, no!

404
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,760
This ought to be fun.

405
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,600
- Argh! Argh!
- Damn!

406
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:01,000
Damn it! Son of a bitch!

407
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,680
God, I'm so sorry, Nikki.

408
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,200
That's Ok.

409
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,800
For all I know,
you could've saved my life.

410
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,920
I don't know if I'm the life-saving kind.
I couldn't save that guy in the woods.

411
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,360
- I thought we were the only ones here.
- He came out of nowhere.

412
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,560
They ripped the shit out of him.

413
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,880
I know! Death by dog is brutal!

414
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,520
None of this makes sense!
There's no reason dogs could do this!

415
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,000
These have the characteristics
of a rabid dog.

416
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,920
- But if they had rabies, they'd be dead.
- Then what is it?

417
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:38,600
- You know that dog compound?
- The seeing-eye dog facility, yeah.

418
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:41,760
What if they were actually training
attack dogs, right?

419
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:45,960
A year ago they shut the compound
down because of a rabies outbreak.

420
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:50,400
So, attack dogs plus a weird strain
of rabies equals what?

421
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,440
Scary-ass Lassies, that's what!

422
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,840
- Relax.
- They don't want us here.

423
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,320
That's what the dude in the woods said.

424
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,520
Twice.
Who cares?

425
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,960
We need to be focusing
on getting the hell outta here!

426
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:10,600
I'm in serious need of some painkillers...

427
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,320
and there's something wrong with Sara.

428
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,800
You feel it, don't you?

429
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:19,040
- Is something wrong with you?
- It comes and goes.

430
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,840
We've gotta be smart here,
smarter than these dogs.

431
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:26,920
Everybody just shut up! You're all
driving me crazy right now! Wild dogs?

432
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,400
Nikki's right, we gotta get outta here!

433
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,920
Sara needs help
and we're gonna do that!

434
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,040
But first, we'll stay in here
where it's safe, let the dogs disperse,

435
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,920
then get in the plane
and get the hell out...

436
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,920
I don't wanna be here
any more.

437
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,240
What do we do?

438
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,480
We get outta here.

439
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,280
Ready?

440
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,000
The dogs are on the dock.

441
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,600
It's like they know we wanna leave.

442
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,120
You gotta be kidding me!

443
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,320
What?

444
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,880
- The plane's drifting away.
- It can't be. I tied it myself.

445
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,080
Look, then.

446
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,200
Shit. If it hits the channel,
it's lost.

447
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,600
The dogs are gone.

448
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,800
You guys, you guys...

449
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:11,080
- I don't wanna go out there.
- You're going.

450
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:20,000
You'll have to swim.
No one else can bring the plane back.

451
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,680
- I know.
- Just give me this.

452
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:34,760
For your brother being a screw-up,
he's stepping up and being a badass.

453
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:38,800
I can't believe this.
They chewed through it on purpose.

454
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,960
Listen, I don't know what the hell
is going on around here

455
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:44,640
but dogs can't think like that.
They can't plan.

456
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:48,840
If a dog chews through rope,
it's because dogs like chewing rope!

457
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,760
Come on, John.

458
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,720
He's almost there.

459
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,400
Shit!

460
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,160
- Come on, swim back, man!
- Swim!

461
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,680
- The dogs!
- Hurry!

462
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:17,920
- Stop looking back!
- Swim! Swim faster!

463
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:21,160
You're fine!

464
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,960
Bitch! Back to the house!
Come on!

465
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:40,640
Hurry up!
Go! Go! Hurry up! Go!

466
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,560
Run!

467
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,600
Go! Go! Get inside!

468
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:51,480
Come on, get up the stairs!

469
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,680
Shut the door! Shut the door!

470
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:08,440
But how did the dogs
even get on the plane?

471
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,920
I once saw a dog balance
a marshmallow on his nose.

472
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,880
Still no service.

473
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:57,080
- You're running a fever.
- I am?

474
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:01,480
Don't worry, it wouldn't be rabies yet.
It could be some other kind of infection.

475
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:04,080
Great.

476
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,560
All right, pros and cons.
What are the negatives?

477
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,480
Negatives? Well, everything.

478
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:11,080
It's dangerous just trying to get
to the garage.

479
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:15,200
We don't know if the car will start
or what we'll find across the island.

480
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:19,040
- Whatever got that guy here.
- With our luck, he parasailed in!

481
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:22,800
The compound has gotta have
some kind of communications system.

482
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,840
Hopefully it's not equipped
with some crazy Old Yellers.

483
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:29,120
Look, we can't stay here.
We gotta get off this island.

484
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,480
Ok. Ok?

485
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,600
Ok, damn!

486
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:54,160
All right, eeny...

487
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,160
Meeny...

488
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,760
Miney...

489
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,480
I'll go.

490
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:14,480
- lt'll lift right off.
- I don't want you to go.

491
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:18,880
- I don't want anyone to go.
- I'll be fine. I'll be really quiet.

492
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:55,000
How much do you weigh?

493
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:59,600
You know how much I weigh, baby.
You're not doing this.

494
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:03,320
Speed climbing champion three years
running. I weigh 120 pounds.

495
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,520
I could do this with my hands tied.

496
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:08,040
You were injured badly.

497
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:10,240
I know my limits.

498
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:12,360
This cable can't support you.

499
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:16,280
I know what I'm talking about.
Think about it.

500
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,360
I mean it. Think about it.

501
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:44,960
- You didn't get any on the handles?
- No, you'll be fine.

502
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:00,120
- Be careful.
- Yeah.

503
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,840
You gotta be kidding me.

504
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,720
They're here.

505
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:39,520
Hurry, Nikki.

506
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:45,280
Hey! Hey!

507
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:49,000
Hey!

508
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:51,880
Dogs! Dogs!

509
00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:00,800
Dogs! Dogs, over here! Come on!

510
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:41,840
Come on!

511
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:49,720
Come on! Piece of shit!

512
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:55,120
- Hey! Are you Ok?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

513
00:48:56,280 --> 00:49:00,320
Just seems like it's gonna be dinnertime
over here soon.

514
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,400
Hang on.
We got something worked out.

515
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:05,600
Come on, guys!

516
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,880
- Let's go!
- Yep!

517
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:11,240
- Good?
- More slack! Watch yourself!

518
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:18,160
- You didn't hit her this time!
- I'm gonna tie the line to the rope.

519
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:20,240
- Pull it across.
- All right.

520
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:22,360
Here it is!

521
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,080
All right, pull it, pull it!

522
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:30,720
Hurry!

523
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:37,600
Come on.

524
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:50,840
Behind you! Jump!

525
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:04,360
Come on!
Nice shot. We got one, man!

526
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:07,440
Come on, pull!
Bring her in, bring her in.

527
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:11,560
Get off the harness!

528
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:34,400
Hey.

529
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:37,760
You have to talk to me.

530
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:43,600
I'm not in pain but...

531
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,880
I think I'm in trouble.

532
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,160
- I'm so sorry for this, Sara.
- Don't be. It's not your fault.

533
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:51,360
- Yes, it is.
- Matt!

534
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,280
It's Ok.

535
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:56,440
This is Ok?

536
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,720
None of this is Ok.

537
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:03,360
We should've left this morning.
We should never even have come here.

538
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:05,640
I didn't know this was supposed
to happen.

539
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:08,720
Of course you didn't. Because
you don't think, you just do,

540
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:12,280
only this time you dragged
all of us down with you.

541
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:20,120
Nikki, just let it happen.

542
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:24,560
Does this make you feel better?
Lay it all on me. I'm the fuck-up.

543
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:28,560
Mum knows it. Dad knew it.
It's never you. It's always me.

544
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:31,720
It is always you. I wasn't given
the room to make mistakes.

545
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:35,000
- That room was filled with yours.
- I just wanted you to have fun.

546
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:37,880
Bullshit. You wanted me to act like you

547
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:43,160
cos if there's two of us it would make
you seem less of a disappointment.

548
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:46,320
It must be nice to have your life
so together.

549
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:49,200
Dad would be proud.

550
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:07,520
What's up? You all right?

551
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:11,040
- How you doing?
- I'm all right.

552
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:18,840
You know, er...

553
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:22,000
when our Dad got sick...

554
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:26,960
...I knew Matt was pissed at me
for bailing,

555
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:29,960
but I just didn't know what to do.

556
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:37,640
After he died, I tried to make it up
to him. I tried to be around more.

557
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:42,720
I just didn't know
he hated me so much.

558
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:45,480
He doesn't hate you
as much as he thinks he does.

559
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:49,520
- All evidence to the contrary.
- He loves you, John.

560
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:54,880
He's here for you.
Mr Responsible skipped school,

561
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:59,200
a week away from his finals, just to
spend a weekend with his big brother.

562
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:04,080
- He can't say no to you.
- Yeah, look where it got him.

563
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:06,760
None of this is your fault.

564
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:09,360
You'll get through this.

565
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:12,520
Besides, you're a hard guy
to stay angry at.

566
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,440
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

567
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:17,520
Even I don't hate you
quite as much as I used to.

568
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:20,880
"Quite."

569
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:25,400
I really love him, you know.

570
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:27,680
I know.

571
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:30,360
I'm glad.

572
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:37,480
- Hey.
- Want a sip?

573
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:39,200
Uh-huh.

574
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:43,520
Your uncle had
very eclectic musical tastes.

575
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:45,800
That's putting it nicely.

576
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,920
- Thank you.
- Cheers.

577
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:53,120
Hey. You're gonna be fine.

578
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:59,160
I feel awful.

579
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:01,920
Why? You guys have been wanting
to do that for years.

580
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:05,080
You'll both recover.
I hope so.

581
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,600
- You ready to turn this mother out?
- Yes!

582
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:09,960
- Ready?
- Come on, Mr DJ.

583
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:16,520
The fuse?
- Yeah. I'll get it. I know where it is.

584
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:19,960
- I'll come with you.
- No, no. Relax, relax.

585
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:22,920
Each of you has your job.
You're the future doctor -

586
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:25,320
smart and calm under pressure.

587
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:28,120
You're the Eagle Scout
in black sheep's clothing -

588
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:30,520
quick with a weapon
and handy with a sea plane.

589
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:34,520
You're the perky, athletic one -
very randy to have around.

590
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:39,240
And you... you look incredibly sexy
in a bikini.

591
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:42,200
<i>Now where does all that leave moi?</i>

592
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:46,040
I'm the one who knows
where the fuse box is.

593
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,320
He's in need of psychiatric help.

594
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:17,120
Why have they always gotta put
the fuse box in the basement? Damn.

595
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:22,880
Ok.

596
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:33,400
Oh!

597
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:46,280
You're mine, baby.

598
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:51,360
Oh! You gotta be kidding me.

599
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:59,400
Almost, baby.

600
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:43,600
Stay with Sara.

601
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:51,960
No!

602
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:01,640
Matt, slide that over here!

603
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:09,240
They're coming
through the door, Nikki! Hurry!

604
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:13,080
Come on, come on!
Come on, hurry up!

605
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:19,600
Get Sara and get upstairs now!
Get upstairs!

606
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:22,920
Get upstairs!
Get to the attic!

607
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:31,840
Oh no!

608
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:47,280
Hurry up!

609
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:50,080
Matt!

610
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:58,520
Grab this!

611
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:05,520
- Ok?
- Let's go, let's go!

612
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:13,400
Hurry!
Let's go!

613
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:28,720
Get the rope!

614
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:44,160
- You Ok?
- My shoulder.

615
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:47,160
Oh, my God! You got bitten!

616
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:04,040
None of this seems real.

617
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:07,400
I can't believe that Noah is dead.

618
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:17,560
Ok, look, we'll get out of here.
We'll get you guys to a doctor,

619
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:22,080
Whatever it is,
they're gonna figure it out.

620
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:26,600
Go away!

621
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:32,840
- Hey, Sara, please...
- Get off me!

622
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:49,600
- I'm so sorry.
- That's Ok.

623
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:52,600
- You know I didn't mean that.
- That's Ok. Come here.

624
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:57,280
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

625
01:00:57,480 --> 01:01:00,080
- I promise.
- Ok.

626
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:02,480
I just don't feel right.

627
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
I know.

628
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:11,760
You'll be all right.

629
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:16,640
Johnny.

630
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:28,560
AMCS.

631
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:33,640
Army Mountain Combat School,
that's who leased the compound.

632
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:38,040
- So they were training attack dogs?
- Could be experiments that went wrong.

633
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:40,840
Why would Uncle Frank
have these papers?

634
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:46,880
Uncle Frank wouldn't be involved
with something like this.

635
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:50,520
- He was an animal rights activist.
- keep telling yourself that.

636
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:54,040
They probably told him what
he told me - that the dogs got rabies,

637
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:57,880
it spread, and that's why
they had to put them all down.

638
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Well, they missed a few.

639
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:41,920
- Clear?
- Yeah, we're good.

640
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:59,840
You guys get in the room.
Stay there.

641
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:04,840
- Be careful.
- I will.

642
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:32,160
What's that smell?

643
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:34,280
They've marked their territory.

644
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:39,160
We're the ones trespassing now.

645
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:51,080
You ready for this?

646
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:55,000
No. You?

647
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:57,120
No.

648
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:13,680
Jesus, Matt. Matt!

649
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:18,680
What is he doing? Is he insane?

650
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:22,040
He's not afraid.

651
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:27,680
So sad.

652
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,080
I've waited ten years
for him to notice me.

653
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:35,760
What are you talking about?

654
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:39,600
It feels over.

655
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:42,640
It's not over. Don't talk like that.

656
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:06,920
Pop the clutch!

657
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:11,800
Shit!

658
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:22,840
Come on, Mattie.

659
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:25,040
Come on, Mattie!

660
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:31,280
- Give me the bow.
- Here.

661
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:46,520
Heads up, Mattie!

662
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:02,360
Come on, come on.

663
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:06,880
We need more speed.

664
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:10,400
Hold on!

665
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:17,520
Better work this time!

666
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:49,040
- Cool.
- Piece of cake.

667
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:02,600
They don't like the noise.

668
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:25,320
Let's go!

669
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:30,480
I don't think I'm gonna make
those finals, Johnny.

670
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:35,200
Shit!

671
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:42,400
Hold on to him!

672
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:02,800
Sara won't come down.
You've gotta help.

673
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:04,720
I got it, Mattie.

674
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:06,640
- I tried everything.
- Get in.

675
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,480
Sara!

676
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:13,280
- Sara.
- Go away.

677
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:15,000
- No.
- Get out!

678
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:16,440
- No!
- I won't make it.

679
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:19,320
I don't care! Get up! On your feet!

680
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,240
Get out of my house!

681
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:27,920
- John, out the window!
- I'm not leaving!

682
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:31,600
You understand?
If I break eye contact, it's over.

683
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:33,880
I will be right behind you.

684
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:38,200
- Gone?
- Yeah.

685
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:57,360
You Ok?

686
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:02,280
Sara!

687
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:13,400
- Sara!
- No, no.

688
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:18,200
- No!
- Come on!

689
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:14,120
That fence didn't used
to be here.

690
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:18,040
We'll break through it with the car.

691
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:22,440
What if the fence is the only thing
standing between us and those dogs?

692
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:24,840
That's true.

693
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:28,400
Ok... Ok,
but we'll leave the car running.

694
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:32,600
If we turn it off, we don't know
if it'll start again.

695
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:35,000
The car's not gonna
get us off this island.

696
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:38,960
Well, if we need to,
it'll get us the hell out of here.

697
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:41,240
Come on.

698
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:46,800
There's gotta be a radio here.
It's no good if there's no power.

699
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:51,040
- Look.
- Solar panel.

700
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:55,240
- We could hook onto that, right?
- Yeah.

701
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:09,440
- Were you ever here?
- No, not inside.

702
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:13,360
Looks like an attack-protection suit.

703
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
What the hell is all this stuff?

704
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:42,640
This was not a training facility.
Something else was going on here.

705
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:46,560
They weren't training anything.

706
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:51,640
They were genetically redesigning them.
They were playing God.

707
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:53,920
No!

708
01:11:58,240 --> 01:12:00,360
Let's keep moving.

709
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:11,960
Here's a radio.

710
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:15,440
No power.

711
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:18,480
All right, how do we hook in
to the solar power?

712
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:21,280
The batteries have to be
around here somewhere.

713
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:25,000
Down here.

714
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:35,360
- Batteries.
- All right, good.

715
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:37,680
I'm gonna check the main first.

716
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:41,400
Hit the breaker.

717
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:45,920
These batteries
are never gonna charge.

718
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:48,800
They're too rusted. Look.

719
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:52,440
No, they're the old lead-acid kind.
They'll hold a charge forever.

720
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:56,200
Positive to positive.
Negative to negative. Just like a car.

721
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:59,160
You good?

722
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:04,720
- Nice.
- Right.

723
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
How do you know all this?

724
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:17,960
You'd be surprised what an irresponsible
fuck-up can pick up over the years.

725
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:20,440
Ok, here we go.

726
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:23,240
Does it Work?

727
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:26,280
- It's dead.
- Still no signal.

728
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:28,880
Give me that cell phone.
Open the back.

729
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:32,320
We can hook up this phone
to the radio tower.

730
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:36,000
It's a giant antenna. By itself,
a cell gives you two, three miles,

731
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:40,600
but a tower like that gives you
over 100. We attach the cell phone...

732
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:43,960
here to the radio antenna.

733
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:49,320
- Shit. No signal.

734
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:53,640
Wait a minute, guys. Look right there,
on the radio tower.

735
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:55,720
- There's a cable detached.
- I'll go.

736
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:59,000
- We gotta stick together.
- I'll go.

737
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:03,400
You guys stay here. Once I connect
the cables, you're gonna see this signal.

738
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:09,080
When you see the signal, you wanna
turn on the antenna amplifier here.

739
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:10,880
All right.

740
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:15,120
Hey... Be careful.

741
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:17,680
We're gonna get outta here.

742
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:39,760
What's wrong?
Baby, calm down, sit down.

743
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:46,360
It's just...

744
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:51,920
What happened to Sara
is gonna happen to me.

745
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:55,480
Matt, don't talk like that.
You're gonna drive yourself crazy.

746
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:07,960
What's wrong?

747
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:10,080
What?

748
01:15:10,240 --> 01:15:12,000
They're inside.

749
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:14,360
What are you talking about?

750
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:17,560
For the dogs to survive
being put down

751
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:19,840
they would've had
to find a way to escape.

752
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:23,480
If they found a way out
of the compound...

753
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:25,800
They found their way back in.

754
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:30,000
John.

755
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:56,560
Argh!

756
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:04,360
Oh, my God!

757
01:17:55,960 --> 01:17:58,480
Give Cujo my best.

758
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,520
Nikki!

759
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:13,440
- Nikki!
- No!

760
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:17,560
Stop it! Listen! Listen to me!

761
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:20,320
There is a boat on the other side
of this fence!

762
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:22,440
It's our only way out!

763
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:25,800
We're not getting off this island, John!

764
01:18:57,640 --> 01:18:59,960
Need a ride?

765
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:07,040
- I thought you were dead.
- Any ideas?

766
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:08,400
Hang on!

767
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:36,280
Come on!

768
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:40,400
- You Ok?
- Yeah.

769
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:44,920
Go!

770
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:55,760
John, get the boat started.

771
01:19:57,680 --> 01:19:59,600
Jump on!

772
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:29,920
What do you think's gonna happen
to you guys?

773
01:20:33,240 --> 01:20:35,840
Find a doctor that can cure it.

774
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:39,760
- What if he can't?
- He has to.

775
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:52,520
I need some sleep.

776
01:20:53,520 --> 01:21:03,520
