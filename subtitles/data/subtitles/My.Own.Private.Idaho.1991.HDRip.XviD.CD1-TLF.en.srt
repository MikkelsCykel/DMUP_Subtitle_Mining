00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:01,701
Five, six, seven, eight...

2
00:01:01,874 --> 00:01:04,342
nine, 10.

3
00:01:44,416 --> 00:01:47,579
I always know where I am
by the way the road looks.

4
00:01:53,058 --> 00:01:55,390
Like I just know that
I've been here before.

5
00:01:55,527 --> 00:01:57,961
I just know that
I've been stuck here...

6
00:01:58,097 --> 00:02:01,396
like this one fucking time before,
you know that?

7
00:02:03,002 --> 00:02:04,833
Yeah.

8
00:02:10,643 --> 00:02:13,669
There's not another road anywhere
that looks like this road.

9
00:02:13,779 --> 00:02:16,873
I mean, exactly like this road.

10
00:02:18,651 --> 00:02:20,676
It's one kind of place.

11
00:02:20,786 --> 00:02:22,879
One of a kind.

12
00:02:23,989 --> 00:02:26,685
Like someone's face.

13
00:02:32,665 --> 00:02:35,156
<i>Like a fucked-up face.</i>

14
00:02:46,578 --> 00:02:49,172
Where do you think
you're running, man?

15
00:02:49,314 --> 00:02:52,943
We're stuck here
together, you shit.

16
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,896
Don't worry.
Everything's gonna be all right.

17
00:03:46,004 --> 00:03:48,871
I know. It's okay.

18
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:53,740
<i>I know, you're sorry. I know.</i>

19
00:04:16,602 --> 00:04:20,902
<i># The cattle are prowlin'
The coyotes are howlin'#</i>

20
00:04:21,039 --> 00:04:24,873
<i># Way out where
the doggies bawl #</i>

21
00:04:25,043 --> 00:04:29,776
<i># Where spurs are a-jinglin'

22
00:04:29,948 --> 00:04:34,544
<i># This lonesome cattle call #</i>

23

<i>#He rides in the sun

24

<i>#And he rounds up

25
00:06:30,602 --> 00:06:32,433
Walt.

26
00:06:32,604 --> 00:06:35,368
<i>- Walt.
- Yeah, Mike?</i>

27
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:40,371
You think, um, that you could
spot me 10 more dollars?

28
00:06:40,545 --> 00:06:44,208
<i>Ten dollars? What's the matter?
You can't get it from your dad?</i>

29
00:06:44,383 --> 00:06:46,715
My dad and I don't get along too well.
You know that, Walt.

30
00:06:46,852 --> 00:06:49,013
<i>We're not getting
along that well either now, are we?</i>

31
00:06:49,121 --> 00:06:51,180
<i>No. We don't get along too well...</i>

32
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:54,726
or else he wouldn't have gone out
and drowned himself at Boxcar Canyon.

33
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,691
<i>- Again?
- Yeah.</i>

34
00:06:56,862 --> 00:06:58,693
<i>He hit the water this time?</i>

35
00:06:58,864 --> 00:07:01,458
<i>- He survived the first time. This time—
- Oh, God.</i>

36
00:07:01,633 --> 00:07:03,760
<i>You're the only one I can ask.
You know that, Walt.</i>

37
00:07:03,869 --> 00:07:07,361
Please! I'll owe you a date.
How about that?

38
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:11,140
I'll owe you a date. Please.

39
00:07:11,276 --> 00:07:13,608
Oh, God, crying tears. Hold on.

40
00:07:13,745 --> 00:07:16,270
<i>Here you go.</i>

41
00:07:16,415 --> 00:07:18,246
Thanks.

42
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:40,970
Don't worry.

43
00:07:41,106 --> 00:07:43,904
Everything's gonna be all right.

44
00:07:44,109 --> 00:07:48,944
<i>Don't worry. Everything's gonna be all right.</i>

45
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:43,896
Here. Now, mind the carpet. It's white.

46
00:08:44,069 --> 00:08:46,731
Give me your shoes.
Give me your shoes.

47
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:52,173
Mmm. Mmm.

48
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:54,210
Okay, just a sec.

49
00:08:54,413 --> 00:08:57,280
Put these on...
so you don't make a mess.

50
00:09:08,493 --> 00:09:10,984
I am so lucky.

51
00:09:11,129 --> 00:09:15,395
I was born on April 4, 1944.

52
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,697
That's 4-4-44.

53
00:09:18,804 --> 00:09:21,796
If you add that up,
it comes to 16.

54
00:09:21,907 --> 00:09:24,432
One, six.

55
00:09:24,576 --> 00:09:27,670
One plus six is seven.

56
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:29,644
Luckiest number of all.

57
00:09:33,185 --> 00:09:37,451
- You know your math.
- It's more than math, Mike.

58
00:09:37,556 --> 00:09:39,387
It's...

59
00:09:41,093 --> 00:09:43,721
immaculate perfection.

60
00:09:46,264 --> 00:09:48,095
Oh.

61
00:09:56,975 --> 00:10:01,309
Boy, this place is a mess.

62
00:10:03,381 --> 00:10:07,784
Yeah, let's make it immaculate.

63
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:09,750
- Okay.
- Okay.

64
00:10:10,856 --> 00:10:13,916
<i>#Deep night #</i>

<i>Harder.</i>

73
00:10:47,359 --> 00:10:50,817

78
00:11:09,047 --> 00:11:11,174
little Dutch boy...

79
00:11:11,283 --> 00:11:13,751
you must scrub...

80
00:11:13,885 --> 00:11:16,752
Daddy Carroll.

81
00:11:32,804 --> 00:11:35,364
This chick's living
in a new car ad.

82
00:11:40,378 --> 00:11:42,278
<i>Feels like a dream.</i>

83
00:11:42,447 --> 00:11:45,610
A girl never picks me up,
much less a pretty, rich girl.

84
00:11:45,717 --> 00:11:49,346
They don't?
I don't know why that is.

85
00:11:51,656 --> 00:11:54,090
This is a nice home.

86
00:11:54,226 --> 00:11:56,922
- Do you live here?
- Yes.

87
00:11:57,095 --> 00:11:59,791
I don't blame you.

88
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:03,733
Oh.

89
00:12:06,338 --> 00:12:08,203
Hey.

90
00:12:08,373 --> 00:12:11,536
<i>What up, Scott? What up, Gary?</i>

91
00:12:11,643 --> 00:12:13,770
Hey, it's Mikey the dike.

92
00:12:13,878 --> 00:12:15,903
<i>You men make yourselves comfortable.</i>

93
00:12:16,014 --> 00:12:17,845
I'll be right back.

94
00:12:18,016 --> 00:12:20,075
There are cokes in the refrigerator.
Help yourselves.

95
00:12:22,053 --> 00:12:26,547
<i>She's cool. Shejust likes to have three guys
'cause it takes her a while to get warmed up.</i>

96
00:12:26,691 --> 00:12:29,125
It's normal. Nothing kinky.

97
00:12:29,261 --> 00:12:31,092
Yeah.

98
00:12:31,263 --> 00:12:34,391
<i>Hey, dude, did you get into that
Sinéad O'Connor concert last night?</i>

99
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:38,868
- What? To —To the Sinéad —
- The chick with the bald head.

100
00:12:39,037 --> 00:12:41,699
I- I've never been
to a concert before, dude.

101
00:12:58,356 --> 00:13:00,449
<i>This is nice.</i>

102
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,771
Backyard.

103
00:14:41,593 --> 00:14:43,584
Oh, shit.

104
00:14:44,696 --> 00:14:46,561
He always does this.

105
00:14:46,765 --> 00:14:49,632
I'm surprised he can exist like this.

106
00:14:49,768 --> 00:14:51,633
How do we know he's okay?

107
00:14:51,803 --> 00:14:54,465
Well, he's not dead. Listen.

108
00:14:58,276 --> 00:15:01,370
He's not dead. He's just passed out.
It's a condition.

109
00:15:02,781 --> 00:15:05,181
He really scared the shit
out of that lady.

110
00:15:05,316 --> 00:15:07,216
What causes it? Sex?

111
00:15:07,419 --> 00:15:11,014
Narcolepsy doctors are saying it's brought on
by certain chemical reactions in the brain.

112
00:15:11,189 --> 00:15:13,214
Comes about in situations of stress.

113
00:15:13,324 --> 00:15:15,155
Some hustler, huh?

114
00:15:17,262 --> 00:15:19,787
Well, where are we
gonna take him?

115
00:15:19,931 --> 00:15:21,796
We can't just leave him here.

116
00:15:21,966 --> 00:15:23,957
Come on, Mikey.

117
00:15:44,222 --> 00:15:46,053
Hey, Mike, you stay here.

118
00:15:46,224 --> 00:15:48,749
When you wake up, come back into town.
I'll be waiting for you.

119
00:15:48,893 --> 00:15:52,590
You'll be safer here in this
comfy neighborhood than in the city.

120
00:15:52,764 --> 00:15:55,528
<i>- I grew up in a neighborhood like this.</i>

121
00:15:56,668 --> 00:15:59,466
And my dad —

122
00:15:59,637 --> 00:16:01,537
He has more fucking
righteous gall...

123
00:16:01,706 --> 00:16:05,301
than all the property
and people he lords over...

124
00:16:05,477 --> 00:16:07,672
and those he also created —

125
00:16:07,779 --> 00:16:10,009
Like me, his son.

126
00:16:10,114 --> 00:16:13,914
<i>I almost get sick
thinking I am a son to him.</i>

127
00:16:14,085 --> 00:16:16,451
<i>You know you have to be
as good as him to keep up.</i>

128
00:16:16,621 --> 00:16:18,714
<i>You have to be able
to lift as big a weight.</i>

129
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:21,224
<i>You have to be able
to throw that weight as far...</i>

130
00:16:21,359 --> 00:16:24,556
<i>or make as much money,
or be as heartless.</i>

131
00:16:29,067 --> 00:16:31,900
My dad doesn't know
that I'm just a kid.

132
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:33,901
He thinks I'm a threat.

133
00:16:37,108 --> 00:16:39,235
<i> No, I won't listen.!
I won't listen to you.!</i>

134
00:16:41,179 --> 00:16:44,307
<i>Hey, Scotty.! Come on, you big stud.!</i>

135
00:16:57,328 --> 00:17:00,354
When you wake up,
wipe the slugs off your face.

136
00:17:00,465 --> 00:17:03,093
Get ready for a new day.

137
00:18:03,061 --> 00:18:05,359
I never thought I could
make it as a real model.

138
00:18:05,496 --> 00:18:08,090
You know,
fashion-oriented modeling.

139
00:18:08,232 --> 00:18:11,099
'Cause I'm better at full-body poses.

140
00:18:11,269 --> 00:18:14,295
It's all right so long as the photographer
doesn't come on to you...

141
00:18:14,405 --> 00:18:16,270
and expect something
for nothing.

142
00:18:16,441 --> 00:18:19,740
I'm trying to make a living.
I like to have a professional attitude.

143
00:18:19,844 --> 00:18:23,336
Of course, if the guy
can pay me, hell yeah.

144
00:18:23,481 --> 00:18:26,644
Here I am for him.
I'll sell my ass.

145
00:18:26,751 --> 00:18:28,742
Do it on the street
occasionally for cash.

146
00:18:28,853 --> 00:18:30,878
Or I'll be on the cover of a book.

147
00:18:31,055 --> 00:18:34,786
It's when you start doing things for free
that you start to grow wings.

148
00:18:34,892 --> 00:18:36,792
Isn't that right, Mike?

149
00:18:39,897 --> 00:18:42,229
- What?
- Wings, Michael.

150
00:18:42,367 --> 00:18:44,198
You grow wings and become a fairy.

151
00:18:44,369 --> 00:18:46,462
What do you care about money?
Shit, you got plenty.

152
00:18:46,571 --> 00:18:49,096
<i> Why don't you go ahead
and do whatever it is that you do—</i>

153
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,606
<i>I can only imagine what that is—
for free?</i>

154
00:18:51,743 --> 00:18:53,904
Is that right, sweetie?

155
00:18:54,012 --> 00:18:57,175
So, how much is a lot of money, honey?

156
00:18:57,281 --> 00:19:01,012
What are you doing on the cover
of that magazine? Slumming?

157
00:19:02,954 --> 00:19:06,048
Actually, Mikey's right.
I am going to inherit money.

158
00:19:06,157 --> 00:19:08,921
A lot of money.

159
00:19:40,992 --> 00:19:42,823
Hi.

160
00:19:42,994 --> 00:19:45,087
- What's happening?
- Nothing.

161
00:19:45,196 --> 00:19:47,391
- You want a lift?
- A lift?

162
00:19:47,498 --> 00:19:49,329
Yes.

163
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:55,003
Isn't this that, uh — that lady's car?

164
00:19:55,173 --> 00:19:57,164
- What's her name?
- Alena.

165
00:19:57,275 --> 00:19:59,106
- Is she a friend of yours?
- No, not really.

166
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:02,143
- She's a very good friend of mine.
- Good.

167
00:20:03,347 --> 00:20:07,374
Any friend of Alena
is a friend of mine.

168
00:20:13,157 --> 00:20:16,854
- You want to be my friend?
- No.

169
00:20:17,028 --> 00:20:18,859
My name is Hans.

170
00:20:19,964 --> 00:20:21,795
I'm from Germany.

171
00:20:21,966 --> 00:20:26,801
- Now I live in America selling pieces for cars.
- Mm-hmm.

172
00:20:26,971 --> 00:20:30,429
- Say, why don't you get in?
- No.

173
00:20:30,575 --> 00:20:33,271
I take you wherever
you want to go.

174
00:20:33,444 --> 00:20:36,470
- Where you want to go?
- Home.

175
00:20:36,581 --> 00:20:38,572
<i>- Get in the car.
- No.</i>

176
00:20:38,683 --> 00:20:41,846
This guy's a pervert,
I can tell, man.

177
00:20:41,953 --> 00:20:46,083
Why don't you go home?
Go the fuck home.

178
00:21:22,927 --> 00:21:27,557
- How did we get home?
- That German guy, Hans.

179
00:21:27,732 --> 00:21:30,360
He brought you downtown.
You were passed out.

180
00:21:30,535 --> 00:21:34,266
He said he was heading to Portland,
so I asked him for a ride.

181
00:21:34,438 --> 00:21:37,498
For some reason, I'm forgetting
a German guy named Hans.

182
00:21:38,876 --> 00:21:40,707
Well, you were sleeping.

183
00:21:44,248 --> 00:21:47,149
So, how much do you make
off me when I'm asleep?

184
00:21:51,589 --> 00:21:53,420
Just a ride, Mike.

185
00:21:54,725 --> 00:21:56,556
I don't make anything.

186
00:21:58,029 --> 00:22:00,623
What, you think I sell your body
while you're asleep?

187
00:22:03,601 --> 00:22:06,195
No, Mike, I'm on your side.

188
00:22:13,044 --> 00:22:15,911
Gary's up here somewhere.
He left about three days ago.

189
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,911
He flew up here with a...

190
00:22:18,082 --> 00:22:19,913
Hairdresser.

191
00:22:20,084 --> 00:22:22,177
Exotic.

192
00:22:22,286 --> 00:22:25,346
I heard something about Bob
coming up here to town. Is that true?

193
00:22:25,456 --> 00:22:29,984
- You hear anything about that?
- Bob.

194
00:22:30,127 --> 00:22:32,186
I don't know.
I hope he's in town.

195
00:22:32,296 --> 00:22:36,790
- We'll have fun if Bob's in town.
- Yeah, I wouldn't mind seeing him.

196
00:22:36,934 --> 00:22:40,028
Hey, didn't you two have like a —

197
00:22:40,137 --> 00:22:44,039
I kind of remember you
having, like, this real heavy, uh —

198
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:46,836
- Thing?
- Thing. A heavy thing goin', right?

199
00:22:47,011 --> 00:22:50,708
- Yeah, we had a real heavy thing going.
- Huh.

200
00:22:50,882 --> 00:22:54,409
- He was fucking in love with me.
- That's what I thought.

201
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:59,317
- Yes.
- He taught me better than school did.

202
00:23:01,459 --> 00:23:03,586
I love Bob more than my father.

203
00:23:05,062 --> 00:23:10,261
I'd say I love Bob more
than my mother and my father.

204
00:23:10,368 --> 00:23:14,031
Yeah, I wouldn't mind seeing him.
I'm — I'm hoping that he comes to town.

205
00:23:23,447 --> 00:23:25,278
<i>Hey, you dick.!</i>

206
00:23:25,449 --> 00:23:27,747
Scotty, my friend.

207
00:23:27,885 --> 00:23:30,581
Ah, you — Hey. You like that, huh?
You like that.

208
00:23:30,721 --> 00:23:33,952
My new Nikes.
My new bracelet.

209
00:23:34,058 --> 00:23:36,424
It says Rudy, though,
but that's cool.

210
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,892
My new Calvins.

211
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:41,794
What a dickhead.

212
00:23:41,966 --> 00:23:44,093
So stupid.

213
00:23:53,511 --> 00:23:55,342
Not when I'm eating.
Don't blow it in my face.

214
00:23:55,513 --> 00:23:58,038
It's the smoking section.

215
00:24:01,752 --> 00:24:05,188
Um, this guy books up
in a black Porsche around the corner.

216
00:24:05,323 --> 00:24:09,726
Uh, I'm asking my friend if,
you know, this guy's okay, if he's cool.

217
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,851
They say—They say,
"Yeah, he'll treat you really good.

218
00:24:11,963 --> 00:24:14,454
"He'll, uh, you know —
He'll — He'll pay you what you want.

219
00:24:14,598 --> 00:24:17,362
He'll, you know — He'll smoke weed with you.
He'll do whatever."

220
00:24:17,535 --> 00:24:19,969
<i>I hadn't dated before or tricked...</i>

221
00:24:20,104 --> 00:24:22,402
<i>or done anything like that before,
so I went with this guy.</i>

222
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:25,771
<i>- Blew it off.
- Well— Uh—</i>

223
00:24:25,843 --> 00:24:28,038
<i>"Let's go to— Let's go to the park.
Let's go to Washington Park. "</i>

224
00:24:28,145 --> 00:24:30,636
<i>So, I said, "Okay. That's cool.
Let's go to Washington Park then. "</i>

225
00:24:30,781 --> 00:24:32,612
And, uh, all of a sudden, before I know it —

226
00:24:32,783 --> 00:24:35,251
I mean, I already laid down the law
before I got into the car.

227
00:24:35,386 --> 00:24:37,786
I told him what I do
and what I don't do.

228
00:24:37,922 --> 00:24:40,982
So, uh, we got up there, and he just
started doing whatever he wanted.

229
00:24:41,092 --> 00:24:43,720
My first date was in Portland.
I was, um —

230
00:24:43,894 --> 00:24:46,192
I was hanging out at the City Club.

231
00:24:46,297 --> 00:24:48,891
I was frying really hard
on acid and speed.

232
00:24:49,066 --> 00:24:51,660
There was this big black guy
who had a lot of eight balls...

233
00:24:51,802 --> 00:24:54,066
of speed and a lot of money.

234
00:24:54,171 --> 00:24:56,765
And, uh, he wanted to get
his dick sucked.

235
00:24:56,941 --> 00:24:59,068
And, uh, I was pretty broke,
and he offered me 60 bucks...

236
00:24:59,176 --> 00:25:01,007
and a bunch of speed.

237
00:25:01,178 --> 00:25:04,670
<i>- So, I went up to his hotel—
- I guess you're just gonna starve.</i>

238
00:25:04,815 --> 00:25:07,113
What she's feeling sorry for herself for?
What's that all about?

239
00:25:07,251 --> 00:25:09,378
<i>So, the plan was, uh—
He was on the third floor.</i>

240
00:25:09,487 --> 00:25:13,218
So my buddy Scott would
hang out on the street on a bench.

241
00:25:13,391 --> 00:25:16,883
When I got up to his room, I was gonna
toss the money out the window to Scott.

242
00:25:17,028 --> 00:25:21,863
There's not really much I could do.
I was up in the — in the woods, in a thicket.

243
00:25:22,033 --> 00:25:25,127
I couldn't get out or anything like that.
I wouldn't do what he wanted me to do.

244
00:25:25,236 --> 00:25:27,704
So, he just kind of flipped out
all over me.

245
00:25:27,838 --> 00:25:32,434
He basically raped me.
He put a fuckin' wine bottle up my butt, right?

246
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:34,441
It was like —
It was, like, horrible.

247
00:25:34,612 --> 00:25:36,739
<i>So, we get up there in the room,
and he, like, just—</i>

248
00:25:36,847 --> 00:25:40,112
He starts getting naked and jackin' off and shit.
And I start gettin' freaked out.

249
00:25:40,217 --> 00:25:42,879
And I say,
"No, I don't want to do this date."

250
00:25:43,054 --> 00:25:46,512
I say, "Let's go down to the street, and I'll
get the money back from my friend Scott.

251
00:25:46,657 --> 00:25:48,955
And we'll just —we'll cancel it, right?"

252
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:51,187
So, we go down to the street
to get the money back...

253
00:25:51,295 --> 00:25:53,126
and Scott's, like, long gone, you know.

254
00:25:55,699 --> 00:25:58,327
What's this? Ooh!

255
00:25:58,502 --> 00:26:03,030
<i>So we're hanging out, and I'm all, "Wait.
He'll be right back. Let's just wait for him. "</i>

256
00:26:03,174 --> 00:26:08,237
So, we wait about five minutes, and he starts
telling me how he's gonna kick my fuckin' ass.

257
00:26:08,345 --> 00:26:12,941
And how my friend's gone and how he's gonna
kill me and all this shit and beat me up.

258
00:26:13,117 --> 00:26:17,019
So I had to go upstairs
and do the date anyway. And, um —

259
00:26:17,188 --> 00:26:20,248
This black guy, he had
a big old fucking cock and shit.

260
00:26:20,357 --> 00:26:24,487
And, um, it was this totally
awful experience, um —

261
00:26:24,595 --> 00:26:29,328
And that was — that was my first date.
I never did another one until a year later.

262
00:27:01,899 --> 00:27:05,027
Jesus. The things we've seen.

263
00:27:06,237 --> 00:27:09,468
Do you remember a thing
since we moved from graffiti bridge?

264
00:27:09,573 --> 00:27:11,598
No more of that, Budd.

265
00:27:18,048 --> 00:27:21,814
Hey, Scotty!
Here comes that fat guy!

266
00:27:21,986 --> 00:27:24,580
- He owes me money!
- Who?

267
00:27:24,755 --> 00:27:27,315
<i>You know, the fat one, Pigeon.!</i>

268
00:27:27,458 --> 00:27:30,894
"I think that I shall never see...

269
00:27:31,028 --> 00:27:33,496
a poem as lovely as a tree."

270
00:27:33,631 --> 00:27:36,828
Hey, everybody!
There goes Bob, the chiseler!

271
00:27:36,934 --> 00:27:40,062
Here comes Bob, the sewer!

272
00:27:40,171 --> 00:27:42,002
<i>The thrasher.!</i>

273
00:27:42,173 --> 00:27:44,903
I think my friends can see...

274
00:27:45,075 --> 00:27:46,975
that I am back from Boise.

275
00:27:47,178 --> 00:27:50,011
<i>- And the listener!
- Hey, everybody, look.!</i>

276
00:27:50,181 --> 00:27:52,012
<i>- And more than that —
- Bob's back.!</i>

277
00:27:52,183 --> 00:27:53,616
My real father.

278
00:27:53,751 --> 00:27:57,448
- Is Jane Lightwork alive, Bob?
- She's alive, Budd.

279
00:27:57,621 --> 00:28:01,819
- Is she holding on?
- Old. Old, Budd.

280
00:28:01,926 --> 00:28:06,056
She must be old.
She has no choice.

281
00:28:06,197 --> 00:28:08,188
Here comes Santa Claus!

282
00:28:08,299 --> 00:28:10,665
<i>- Yeah.!
- Whoo!</i>

283
00:28:12,203 --> 00:28:14,763
<i>Jesus, the things we've seen.</i>

284
00:28:14,939 --> 00:28:18,306
Aren't I right, Bob? Aren't I right?

285
00:28:18,442 --> 00:28:21,036
We have heard the chimes at midnight.

286
00:28:21,212 --> 00:28:24,340
That we have. That we have.

287
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:27,747
In fact, Bob, we have.

288
00:28:27,851 --> 00:28:30,979
Jesus. The things we've seen.

289
00:28:47,838 --> 00:28:51,467
- Where's Bob?
- Crashed out in his room.

290
00:28:51,642 --> 00:28:53,906
Snoring like a horse.

291
00:29:10,928 --> 00:29:12,953
What did you get?

292
00:29:13,063 --> 00:29:15,361
I think this is coke.
I'm not sure though.

293
00:29:19,536 --> 00:29:21,731
Yeah, it's fucking coke.

294
00:29:25,809 --> 00:29:27,800
Oh, fuck!

295
00:29:27,911 --> 00:29:31,108
What the hell? Scott.

296
00:29:31,215 --> 00:29:33,376
My true son.

297
00:29:33,517 --> 00:29:38,147
- How are you? What time is it?
- What do you care?

298
00:29:38,289 --> 00:29:41,952
Why, you wouldn't even look at a clock
unless hours were lines of coke...

299
00:29:42,126 --> 00:29:44,526
dials looked like
the signs of gay bars...

300
00:29:44,662 --> 00:29:47,995
or time itself was
a fair hustler in black leather.

301
00:29:48,132 --> 00:29:50,498
Isn't that right, Bob?

302
00:29:52,469 --> 00:29:56,701
<i>There's no reason to know the time.
We are timeless.</i>

303
00:29:56,807 --> 00:29:59,605
Aren't you forgetting, Scotty, my boy...

304
00:29:59,777 --> 00:30:01,904
the mayor's son, no less...

305
00:30:02,012 --> 00:30:03,843
that we who steal...

306
00:30:06,083 --> 00:30:08,415
do so at midnight?

307
00:30:08,552 --> 00:30:10,383
Who ripped me off?

308
00:30:12,122 --> 00:30:14,113
<i>Budd.! Budd.!</i>

309
00:30:14,224 --> 00:30:18,820
- Yes, Bob?
- I fell asleep, and I've been robbed!

310
00:30:18,996 --> 00:30:22,989
- Jane!
- You'd think I could keep the peace of my house.

311
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:26,433
Jane! I know you well enough.

312
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:29,869
Bob! Bob, we'll find your drugs.

313
00:30:30,007 --> 00:30:32,441
<i>We'll find them.</i>

314
00:30:36,113 --> 00:30:39,173
This hotel is full of thieves, junkies!

315
00:30:39,283 --> 00:30:40,875
<i>You are the thief.</i>

316
00:30:42,853 --> 00:30:45,549
You have corrupted me, Scotty.

317
00:30:45,723 --> 00:30:49,022
I was an innocent before I met you.

318
00:30:49,159 --> 00:30:52,219
And now look at me,
just a little better than wicked.

319
00:30:52,363 --> 00:30:54,695
- I used to be a virtuous man.
- Ha!

320
00:30:54,832 --> 00:30:56,925
Well, virtuous enough.

321
00:30:57,034 --> 00:31:00,470
I swore a little. I never gambled
more than seven times a week! Poker!

322
00:31:00,604 --> 00:31:02,902
I never picked up a street boy
more than once a quarter.

323
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,507
- Of an hour!
- Of an hour.

324
00:31:04,641 --> 00:31:08,270
<i>Bad company has corrupted me.</i>

325
00:31:08,445 --> 00:31:11,744
I'll be darned if I haven't forgotten
what the inside of a church looks like.

326
00:31:11,849 --> 00:31:15,717
I see a change for Bob to make.

327
00:31:15,886 --> 00:31:19,287
From stealing... to preaching.

328
00:31:19,423 --> 00:31:22,017
Stealing is my vocation, Scott.

329
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,252
<i>- It's not a sin for a man —
- Hey, psst.!</i>

330
00:31:24,395 --> 00:31:26,454
To labor at his vocation.

331
00:31:26,563 --> 00:31:28,724
<i>Very early tomorrow morning
there's gonna be a bunch...</i>

332
00:31:28,832 --> 00:31:31,426
of small-time rock-and-roll promoters
coming back from their gig.

333
00:31:31,568 --> 00:31:33,866
<i>And every night they walk home
with the loot.</i>

334
00:31:34,004 --> 00:31:36,234
They stop by the Grotto Bar.
It's about a half—

335
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:38,706
No, it's about mile
down the road from here.

336
00:31:38,842 --> 00:31:41,208
Dude, if we can't steal from
them going into the bar...

337
00:31:41,345 --> 00:31:44,143
<i>dude, we can get them comin'out.!</i>

338
00:31:44,314 --> 00:31:46,214
- See, Bob, dude?
- Not me.

339
00:31:46,417 --> 00:31:48,749
So long as I don't know these
guys personally, it's okay with me.

340
00:31:48,886 --> 00:31:52,515
See, uh —They're from Beaverton,
new to the business.

341
00:31:52,689 --> 00:31:56,557
I'm not gonna go along with this crackpot
scheme, especially since Gary thought it up.

342
00:31:56,727 --> 00:31:59,787
Come off it, Mike.
There is a better way to make a buck...

343
00:31:59,897 --> 00:32:02,263
something to fall back on
other than your ass.

344
00:32:02,433 --> 00:32:04,264
I'll fall back when
Scott inherits his money.

345
00:32:07,171 --> 00:32:10,538
<i> Bob, we don't need these guys.
We can do this ourself. Fuck them.!</i>

346
00:32:10,674 --> 00:32:13,074
- Come on, Mikey. I have a joke I want to play.
- Okay.

347
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:17,044
- Ajoke I can't pull off alone.
- Okay. I think that stuff was —

348
00:32:17,214 --> 00:32:18,647
Bob!

349
00:32:18,782 --> 00:32:20,977
- Aaah! Oh, my sweetheart.
- Oh!

350
00:32:21,084 --> 00:32:24,542
- Come and rob with us tomorrow.
- I was going to anyway. I was just kidding.

351
00:32:24,688 --> 00:32:26,588
- Good.
- Right? We'll have fun.

352
00:32:26,757 --> 00:32:28,349
- All right.
- We'll be rich!

353
00:32:28,525 --> 00:32:29,958
- Yeah, we'll be rich.
- We're gonna be rich.

354
00:32:30,093 --> 00:32:32,789
- Gary says we'll be rich!
- We're gonna be rich!

355
00:32:32,963 --> 00:32:36,399
<i>We're gonna be rich. We're gonna be rich.</i>

356
00:32:36,533 --> 00:32:38,364
<i>We're gonna be rich.</i>

357
00:32:38,535 --> 00:32:40,400
Ho! Ho! Ho!

358
00:32:40,571 --> 00:32:43,267
Budd? Budd.
It's all right, Budd.

359
00:32:43,474 --> 00:32:46,705
Budd, just —just relax, Budd.

360
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:50,871
Provide for us,
oh, great psychedelic papa!

361
00:32:52,382 --> 00:32:54,247
Scotty!

362
00:32:54,418 --> 00:32:57,751
When you inherit your fortune
on your 21 st birthday—

363
00:32:57,888 --> 00:33:01,483
Let's see.
How far away is this?

364
00:33:01,625 --> 00:33:04,423
One week away, Bob.
Just one more week.

365
00:33:06,497 --> 00:33:11,059
Let's not call ourselves
robbers but Diana's foresters...

366
00:33:11,235 --> 00:33:13,533
gentlemen of the shade...

367
00:33:13,637 --> 00:33:17,232
minions of the moon...

368
00:33:17,407 --> 00:33:19,238
men of good government.

369
00:33:36,193 --> 00:33:39,959
<i>When I turn 21,
I don't want any more of this life.</i>

370
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:44,692
My mother and father will be surprised
at the incredible change.

371
00:33:44,835 --> 00:33:48,430
It will impress them more when
such a fuckup like me turns good...

372
00:33:48,605 --> 00:33:51,506
<i>than if I had been a good son all along.</i>

373
00:33:51,675 --> 00:33:55,338
All my bad behavior
I will throw away to pay a debt.

374
00:33:55,546 --> 00:33:58,674
I will change when everybody
expects it the least.

375
00:33:58,782 --> 00:34:00,682
You'll become a head-roller...

376
00:34:00,851 --> 00:34:02,682
a hatchet man for your old man.

377
00:34:04,388 --> 00:34:08,051
No! You will be
the hatchet man, Bob!

378
00:34:08,225 --> 00:34:10,352
<i>That will be yourjob.</i>

379
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:13,861
And so there will rarely
be a job hatcheted.

380
00:34:13,997 --> 00:34:19,435
It will all be just one endless party.

381
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:22,164
Won't it?

382
00:34:23,574 --> 00:34:27,169
But at least my little friend
has offered me a job.

383
00:34:27,311 --> 00:34:30,007
They're so good to me.

384
00:34:37,521 --> 00:34:41,116
<i> How long has it been, Bob,
since you could see your dick?</i>

385
00:34:41,291 --> 00:34:43,191
About four years, Scotty.

386
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:47,262
Four years of grief
blows a man up like a balloon.

387
00:34:47,431 --> 00:34:51,731
- There's rock-and-roll money coming this way!
- And they're drunk as skunks!

388
00:34:56,907 --> 00:34:59,933
All right. All right.
You four should head them off there.

389
00:35:00,043 --> 00:35:02,341
We four?
How many are walking with 'em?

390
00:35:02,446 --> 00:35:06,542
<i>- There's five of'em.
- Five? Shouldn't they be robbing us?</i>

391
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:10,211
<i> If they escape from you guys,
Mike and I will get 'em here.</i>

392
00:35:10,354 --> 00:35:13,517
Oh, eight feet of this muck's
like 30 yards of flat road —

393
00:35:13,624 --> 00:35:16,115
Would you guys shut up?
Shut up! Pay attention.

394
00:35:16,259 --> 00:35:20,252
- Squat down! Squat down!
- Squat down? You got a crane to lift me up?

395
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:30,164
- Where are our disguises?
- Right behind us.

396
00:35:34,311 --> 00:35:36,142
- Let's go.
- Okay.

397
00:35:38,315 --> 00:35:40,977
<i>- Who are thesejokers, man?
- Look like Rajneesh.</i>

398
00:35:44,187 --> 00:35:46,348
This one looks like
he's a little thirsty.

399
00:35:46,456 --> 00:35:51,155
Ha-ha! Up against the wall...

400
00:35:51,328 --> 00:35:53,660
- you sully scumbags!
- Don't shoot.

401
00:35:53,797 --> 00:35:56,027
Ha-ha!

402
00:35:56,133 --> 00:35:58,727
<i>Up against the wall.</i>

403
00:35:58,902 --> 00:36:01,564
<i>Come on.! Come on.!</i>

404
00:36:01,738 --> 00:36:04,605
<i>Don't shoot us.</i>

405
00:36:04,775 --> 00:36:06,800
That's right.

406
00:36:08,979 --> 00:36:13,473
<i>- Fags.
- Okay, set the box down. That's right.</i>

407
00:36:13,617 --> 00:36:17,951
Thank you.
Nice and gently. Nice and gently.

408
00:36:18,088 --> 00:36:20,147
Let's see what we have.

409
00:36:23,026 --> 00:36:26,826
Yes, my baby doll. Ooh.

410
00:36:28,632 --> 00:36:30,964
Tickets anyone to next week's show?

411
00:36:34,504 --> 00:36:37,166
Scott and Mike
have disappeared.

412
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:40,104
Could the shots
have scared them away?

413
00:36:40,277 --> 00:36:42,142
Maybe we should get
the hell out of here.

414
00:36:42,312 --> 00:36:45,804
Are they such chickens?

415
00:37:02,733 --> 00:37:04,724
Let's get the hell out of here!

416
00:37:08,004 --> 00:37:11,371
The thieves scatter!

417
00:37:11,508 --> 00:37:14,102
Bob Pigeon will sweat to death.

418
00:37:22,085 --> 00:37:24,212
Has anyone seen my son?

419
00:37:24,321 --> 00:37:27,484
It's been a full three months
since I last saw him.

420
00:37:27,591 --> 00:37:30,719
Where is my son Scott?

421
00:37:30,827 --> 00:37:32,658
<i>- We don't know, sir.
- Ask around in old town.</i>

422
00:37:32,829 --> 00:37:34,660
Some of the taverns there.

423
00:37:34,831 --> 00:37:37,595
Some say he frequently is seen down there
drinking with street denizens.

424
00:37:37,768 --> 00:37:41,226
<i>Some who they say even rob
our citizens and store owners.</i>

425
00:37:41,371 --> 00:37:45,705
I can't believe that such an effeminate boy
supports such friends.

426
00:38:08,498 --> 00:38:12,992
Hey, Mikey, how long have I been here
on the streets on this crusade?

427
00:38:14,104 --> 00:38:16,504
Huh. W-Well, I came back to town
around three and a half years ago...

428
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,471
and that's when I met you.

429
00:38:18,642 --> 00:38:20,473
- So, it's been —
- It's been three years, Mike.

430
00:38:20,644 --> 00:38:23,545
Yeah, almost four years.
That's a long time.

431
00:38:23,713 --> 00:38:27,376
What I'm getting at, Mike,
is that we're still alive.

432
00:38:29,586 --> 00:38:32,817
Yeah. Well, that's obvious, isn't it?

433
00:38:32,923 --> 00:38:35,391
Yeah. It's incredibly obvious.

434
00:38:35,525 --> 00:38:38,517
They could drop a big old bomb on this city.

435
00:38:38,628 --> 00:38:41,995
- Know what we would do?
- Take shelter?

436
00:38:54,778 --> 00:38:58,145
- This bike was caught with much ease, Mike.
- Yes.

437
00:38:58,281 --> 00:39:00,613
And the reward for the joke
that we played last night...

438
00:39:00,817 --> 00:39:04,378
will be the unbelievably huge lies
that Bob will come up with now.

439
00:39:08,725 --> 00:39:11,853
A plague on all cowards!

440
00:39:13,663 --> 00:39:16,860
What's up, Bob?
Where have you been?

441
00:39:16,967 --> 00:39:19,697
Where have I been?

442
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:23,966
If manhood's not forgotten on the face
of the earth, then I'm a shot herring.

443
00:39:24,074 --> 00:39:26,167
You sit down, you little fuck.

444
00:39:26,276 --> 00:39:28,403
<i>A mayor's son.</i>

445
00:39:28,511 --> 00:39:31,776
<i>If I jog you out of that right
and teach you to be a man...</i>

446
00:39:31,882 --> 00:39:36,182
your father would be as proud of me
as he would you, Scotty!

447
00:39:36,319 --> 00:39:39,117
Why, you whoring round man.

448
00:39:39,289 --> 00:39:42,053
What is the matter?

449
00:39:42,225 --> 00:39:45,422
Are you not a coward?
Answer that.

450
00:39:45,528 --> 00:39:48,725
- And that goes double.
- You calling me a coward? You fat duck.

451
00:39:48,832 --> 00:39:52,393
I'd give $1,000 to be able
to run as fast as you can.

452
00:39:52,535 --> 00:39:55,527
- It'll never happen, Bob.
- Where's the money, Bob?

453
00:39:55,639 --> 00:39:57,664
Where is it?

454
00:39:57,774 --> 00:40:01,107
- Taken from us by 20 or 30 punks.
- Thirty?

455
00:40:01,244 --> 00:40:03,405
<i>I was struggling with a dozen of them.</i>

456
00:40:03,513 --> 00:40:05,504
I think my arm's broken
from the fight.

457
00:40:05,615 --> 00:40:09,779
Certainly a toe. Most definitely a rib.

458
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:13,412
- Let me tell you about it.
- Tell us about it, please.

459
00:40:13,556 --> 00:40:17,185
<i>- We four set upon a dozen of'em.
- Sixteen, at least, Digger, my boy.</i>

460
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:21,558
Yeah, and got their money.
As we were splitting it, 16 others set upon us.

461
00:40:21,665 --> 00:40:24,566
Thank God you had not
murdered some of them.

462
00:40:24,734 --> 00:40:30,036
Murdered?
Well, they are past praying for.

463
00:40:31,241 --> 00:40:33,471
I peppered two of them.

464
00:40:33,576 --> 00:40:36,568
<i>- Two punks in leather jackets.
- What?</i>

465
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:39,410
- I'll tell you, son. These four came in close.
- You said there were two —

466
00:40:39,582 --> 00:40:42,847
Four! I said there were four, Scott.

467
00:40:42,953 --> 00:40:44,318
Four.

468
00:40:44,454 --> 00:40:48,185
<i>These four came from the front,
kicking at me, pulling their knives.</i>

469
00:40:48,358 --> 00:40:51,623
And I whipped out the blade
and took all seven as a target, like this!

470
00:40:51,728 --> 00:40:54,492
Seven! Just a second ago,
there were four.

471
00:40:54,664 --> 00:40:56,962
- In leather?
- No, Bob, my friend.

472
00:40:57,067 --> 00:40:58,967
There was four of'em,
and they all had leather on.

473
00:40:59,135 --> 00:41:01,330
Seven, by my count.

474
00:41:01,438 --> 00:41:03,998
Leave him alone.
We shall have more soon.

475
00:41:04,174 --> 00:41:07,473
<i>As I was saying, these nine in the alleyway
that I told you about—</i>

476
00:41:07,577 --> 00:41:10,671
There's more already, I see. Nine?

477
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:16,241
Full force, and with thought,
seven of the 11 I pegged!

478
00:41:16,386 --> 00:41:18,752
There are 11 now.
He started with two.

479
00:41:18,888 --> 00:41:22,881
<i>But, as the devil would have it,
three of them came at my back.</i>

480
00:41:22,993 --> 00:41:25,291
They were wearing green.

481
00:41:25,395 --> 00:41:28,091
And they had it out with me.

482
00:41:28,264 --> 00:41:30,630
Because it was so dark, Scotty...

483
00:41:30,767 --> 00:41:34,669
<i>that you could not see your hand.</i>

484
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:39,904
How could you see green
when it was so dark...

485
00:41:40,076 --> 00:41:41,907
that you couldn't see your hand?

486
00:41:44,447 --> 00:41:46,972
- Tell us the reason. Come on, Bob.
- Tell us!

487
00:41:47,117 --> 00:41:49,142
<i>- Come on, Bob.!
- Tell us the reason, Bob.!</i>

488
00:41:49,252 --> 00:41:51,652
- Tell us why.
- You can tell 'em. Go on and tell 'em.

489
00:41:53,156 --> 00:41:56,353
<i>- Upon compulsión?
- Come on, Bob.</i>

490
00:41:56,459 --> 00:42:00,020
Not for you or I or all the rest of the worid
would I tell you...

491
00:42:00,163 --> 00:42:01,994
on compulsión!

492
00:42:03,433 --> 00:42:06,800
I will no longer
be guilty of this sin!

493
00:42:06,936 --> 00:42:10,702
This sanguine coward,
this horseback-breaker...

494
00:42:10,874 --> 00:42:14,071
this huge hill of jelly!

495
00:42:19,115 --> 00:42:22,278
<i>Punk.! You starfish.!</i>

496
00:42:22,385 --> 00:42:26,185
Oh, for breath to utter what lies
of a tailor's yardstick!

497
00:42:26,356 --> 00:42:29,120
<i>You boot case.! You vile punk.!</i>

498
00:42:29,292 --> 00:42:32,750
Breathe a while, and then do it again.

499
00:42:32,896 --> 00:42:34,727
But hear me out.

500
00:42:34,898 --> 00:42:40,097
<i>We two saw you four set upon five.</i>

501
00:42:40,203 --> 00:42:42,034
And, Bob...

502
00:42:42,205 --> 00:42:45,436
you carried yourself
away at the slightest noise.

503
00:42:47,377 --> 00:42:51,177
<i>And roared for mercy. And ran and roared
as ever I heard a bull calf.</i>

504
00:42:56,319 --> 00:43:02,189
What trick,
what device can you find...

505
00:43:02,358 --> 00:43:06,454
<i>to hide from this open
and apparent shame?</i>

506
00:43:06,563 --> 00:43:08,463
<i>Yes.</i>

507
00:43:10,233 --> 00:43:13,725
What new trick
do you have for us now, Bob?

508
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:19,471
Good Lord, lads.

509
00:43:21,244 --> 00:43:23,940
I know you as well as
he that made you.

510
00:43:25,448 --> 00:43:29,043
Do you think that I would
kill the heir apparent?

511
00:43:29,185 --> 00:43:32,382
Do you think I would turn on you, Scotty?

512
00:43:33,656 --> 00:43:37,251
Why, you're our only ticket
out of this poverty and oppressión.

513
00:43:39,129 --> 00:43:42,860
I am as valued as Hercules.

514
00:43:43,032 --> 00:43:44,863
But beware my instinct.

515
00:43:46,703 --> 00:43:50,571
The lion will not touch the true heir.

516
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:52,799
<i>Good Lord, lads...</i>

517
00:43:52,942 --> 00:43:55,206
I'm glad you have the money.

518
00:44:22,639 --> 00:44:25,199
If we're looking for a fat man,
why don't we get one under the bridge?

519
00:44:26,342 --> 00:44:29,641
<i>Oh.! Oh.! The sheriff and his posse are here.</i>

520
00:44:34,484 --> 00:44:36,679
<i>Scotty, they've come to search the house.</i>

521
00:44:36,786 --> 00:44:39,414
Shall I let them in?

522
00:44:39,589 --> 00:44:42,752
Call in the sheriff!

523
00:44:52,101 --> 00:44:54,228
- God.
- Oh, God, what's that smell?

524
00:45:01,711 --> 00:45:03,201
Hey!

525
00:45:03,346 --> 00:45:04,973
- Hey!
- There they are.

526
00:45:05,148 --> 00:45:06,979
- Over there! Over there!
- Come here, you little shit!

527
00:45:08,351 --> 00:45:10,046
Come here!

528
00:45:11,487 --> 00:45:13,546
There he goes! In the door!

529
00:45:22,498 --> 00:45:25,592
<i>Baby, yeah.</i>

530
00:45:30,607 --> 00:45:32,905
Wait, wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait!

531
00:45:37,247 --> 00:45:40,614
Aha! What have we here?

532
00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:44,550
Pardon me, Mr. Favor. An informant
has followed certain men into this house.

533
00:45:44,721 --> 00:45:47,087
- What men?
- One of them is well known, sir.

534
00:45:47,257 --> 00:45:50,317
- A large fat man.
- Fat as butter.

535
00:45:50,426 --> 00:45:52,917
Well, he's not here.

536
00:45:53,062 --> 00:45:55,462
<i>But if I see him...</i>

537
00:45:55,598 --> 00:45:59,864
I'll promise you that
I'll send him to you by...

538
00:45:59,969 --> 00:46:02,767
dinnertime tomorrow...

539
00:46:02,939 --> 00:46:06,397
to answer against any such charges.

540
00:46:06,542 --> 00:46:10,808
So, would you leave us alone?

541
00:46:13,216 --> 00:46:15,514
<i>- You.!
- Sorry for the interruption.</i>

542
00:46:16,653 --> 00:46:18,712
We have a message for you
from your father.

543
00:46:18,788 --> 00:46:20,619
He'd like to see you
as soon as possible.

544
00:46:21,958 --> 00:46:23,789
Fuck you.

545
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:40,465
<i>I don't know whether it is God
trying to get back at me...</i>

546
00:46:40,610 --> 00:46:43,943
for something I have done, but...

547
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:48,278
your passing through life makes me certain
that you are marked...

548
00:46:48,384 --> 00:46:51,876
<i>and that heaven is punishing me
for my mistreatings.</i>

549
00:46:52,955 --> 00:46:55,515
<i>When I got back from France
and set foot in Clark County...</i>

550
00:46:55,725 --> 00:46:59,354
<i>and saw what your cousin, Bill Davis,
had done at his family's ranch...</i>

551
00:46:59,462 --> 00:47:02,659
I thought, by my soul...

552
00:47:02,799 --> 00:47:06,826
he has more worthy interest to my estate
than you could hold a candle to.

553
00:47:07,837 --> 00:47:12,274
And being no older than you are,
he organizes operations for state senators...

554
00:47:12,408 --> 00:47:14,740
<i>Iobbies for the small businessman...</i>

555
00:47:14,877 --> 00:47:18,643
<i>and has an ambitious five-year plan for
the forest that even I would like to support.</i>

556
00:47:19,949 --> 00:47:22,247
And then I have to think of you...

557
00:47:23,619 --> 00:47:26,281
and what a degenerate you are.

558
00:47:26,456 --> 00:47:28,287
Don't think that, Father.

559
00:47:29,759 --> 00:47:32,023
You will find out it's not true.

560
00:47:32,128 --> 00:47:34,028
And I hope that somebody
forgives the people...

561
00:47:34,197 --> 00:47:36,427
that have swayed
your fond thoughts away from me.

562
00:47:37,533 --> 00:47:40,400
<i>For a time will come when I will
make this northern youth...</i>

563
00:47:40,570 --> 00:47:43,198
<i>trade me his good deeds
for my indignities.</i>

564
00:47:44,407 --> 00:47:46,932
Bill Davis is my good cousin.

565
00:47:47,076 --> 00:47:50,739
But even the slightest
worship of his time —

566
00:47:50,913 --> 00:47:52,744
Dad —

567
00:47:54,317 --> 00:47:56,842
I will die...

568
00:47:56,986 --> 00:47:59,853
a hundred thousand deaths...

569
00:48:00,022 --> 00:48:01,853
before that happens.

570
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,915
I wanna see my face on the front
of album covers.

571
00:48:33,022 --> 00:48:35,320
I wanna produce my own music.

572
00:48:35,458 --> 00:48:37,585
You know, I just — I just want
total control over my music.

573
00:48:37,693 --> 00:48:39,991
I wanna engineer it.
I wanna mix it.

574
00:48:40,096 --> 00:48:42,826
You know, I wanna — I wanna get
my own say on opening bands.

575
00:48:42,999 --> 00:48:47,333
Then I'd like to, like, stand in back
of bigger pictures of myself.

576
00:48:47,470 --> 00:48:51,531
- That's good.
- And you?

577
00:48:51,641 --> 00:48:53,472
I don't care.

578
00:48:55,378 --> 00:48:57,209
Where should we go?

579
00:48:59,649 --> 00:49:03,176
- To visit my brother.
- You have a brother?

580
00:49:03,319 --> 00:49:06,618
Yeah, I've got a brother, man.
You know that.

581
00:49:06,722 --> 00:49:08,553
Where is he?

582
00:49:10,259 --> 00:49:15,026
Well, I'm thinking he should be
someplace in, uh, the potato state.

583
00:49:15,198 --> 00:49:17,029
Idaho.

584
00:49:23,539 --> 00:49:25,803
Shut up, Mike.

585
00:49:27,610 --> 00:49:31,273
If I'd known it'd be this hard to start,
I wouldn't have stopped it at all.

586
00:49:35,384 --> 00:49:37,545
I've been on this road before.

587
00:49:39,989 --> 00:49:41,820
This is my road.

588
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:46,391
Looks like a fucked-up face.

589
00:49:47,663 --> 00:49:51,292
<i>Like it's saying, "Have a nice day"
or something.</i>

590
00:49:51,501 --> 00:49:53,526
See what I mean, Scott.

591
00:49:55,238 --> 00:49:57,069
<i>Scott, look.</i>

592
00:50:04,847 --> 00:50:06,678
Thanks.

593
00:50:07,917 --> 00:50:10,681
What?

594
00:50:13,256 --> 00:50:15,690
- You need some help with this, man?
- Shut up.

595
00:50:15,825 --> 00:50:18,020
You shut up.

596
00:50:18,127 --> 00:50:21,119
- You suck.
- Do you know anything about bikes?

597
00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:23,994
Yeah, l-I've turned over a few.

598
00:50:29,272 --> 00:50:31,433
Scott, man, where are you going?

599
00:50:41,751 --> 00:50:43,776
Getting away from everything feels good.

600
00:50:43,886 --> 00:50:45,717
Yeah, it does.

601
00:50:47,123 --> 00:50:50,183
When I left home,
the maid asked me where I was off to.

602
00:50:50,293 --> 00:50:54,127
I said, "Wherever, whatever.

603
00:50:54,297 --> 00:50:56,128
Have a nice day."

604
00:50:56,299 --> 00:50:58,733
You had a maid?

605
00:50:58,868 --> 00:51:00,995
Yeah.

606
00:51:07,109 --> 00:51:11,409
If I had a normal family
and a good upbringing...

607
00:51:11,514 --> 00:51:14,972
then I would have been
a well-adjusted person.

608
00:51:15,117 --> 00:51:18,644
Depends on what you call normal.

609
00:51:19,755 --> 00:51:21,985
Yeah, it does.

610
00:51:22,091 --> 00:51:25,686
Well, you know, normal,
like — like a mom and a dad...

611
00:51:25,828 --> 00:51:26,920
and a dog and shit like that.

612
00:51:27,029 --> 00:51:29,224
Normal. Normal.

613
00:51:29,332 --> 00:51:31,163
So you didn't have a normal dog?

614
00:51:32,535 --> 00:51:35,231
- No, I didn't have a dog.
- You didn't have a — a normal dad?

615
00:51:35,438 --> 00:51:39,238

I mean, I feel like I'm —
I feel like I'm, you know, well-adjusted.

618
00:51:49,051 --> 00:51:51,519
What's a normal dad?

619
00:51:51,654 --> 00:51:54,122
I don't know.

620
00:51:57,627 --> 00:52:00,027
I'd like to talk with you.

621
00:52:00,162 --> 00:52:03,859
I mean, I'd like to really talk with you.

622
00:52:04,033 --> 00:52:06,866
We're talking right now,
but, you know —

623
00:52:07,036 --> 00:52:09,800
