2
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:44,501
Always saying goodbye.

3
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:47,129
So I learned to be alone.

4
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,466
But with street dance,

5
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:54,470
I could step out in front of any crowd,
into any street dance battle,

6
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:57,056
and for one moment, be the hero.

7
00:00:57,974 --> 00:01:00,642
And then, being alone didn't matter any more.

8
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:04,605
I was able to show off my moves,

9
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:07,983
taking on the local legends
in street dance battles.

10
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:13,822
And legends, they don't come
any bigger than this crew.

11
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:20,454
Two-times Final Clash Champions
and on their way to Paris to make it three.

12
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:23,540
Invincible.

13
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:26,168
Named after the biggest ego in street dance.

14
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:29,671
Vince.

15
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:41,350
Vince! Vince! Vince! Vince!

16
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:50,859
This was the moment,
right here in London.

17
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:55,280
The moment to take on the legend.

18
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,832
This was the moment to be the best.

19
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:22,975
This was my moment.

20
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,232
Or not.

21
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,318
Yeah, yeah. Is that all you got?

22
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:39,074
Some nerdy little popcorn boy
who can't even stay on his feet?

23
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:43,579
You got two months, Europe,
till the Final Clash.

24
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:47,416
Y'all better rustle up some new ideas.

25
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:49,793
Or we will kick ass.

26
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,838
You got that, Popcorn?

27
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:03,765
I was just trying to see the show.
Easy, easy, easy. Easy!

28
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:22,075
- What? You come to have a laugh too?
- No. I wanna be your manager.

29
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:28,624
I'm gonna help you put a crew together
for the Final Clash.

30
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:31,210
Right now is not a good time.

31
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:34,588
You know, you jumping in there
and falling on your arse was really, really...

32
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:35,964
I know. Really stupid.

33
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:38,759
No, inspiring. You showed a lot of courage.

34
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:41,637
- Thanks.
- Look, someone needs to stand up to Vince.

35
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,555
And that's why I think I'd be a top manager.

36
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,059
I can get you all the top dancers
you need to beat Invincible.

37
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:49,645
- Who are you?
- Hi. I'm Eddie.

38
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:54,942
Look, Eddie, thanks for your offer,
but Invincible are just that, invincible.

39
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:58,612
- Look, you're impulsive.
- I'm impulsive?

40
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,447
Yes, and you need to learn a bit of patience.

41
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,115
- Taxi.
- A bit of discipline.

42
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:04,034
- I could be your Yoda.
- Yoda?

43
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:08,538
Secondly, you're American and I'm European.
So you could use someone local.

44
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:12,084
Someone who understands the culture.
Like a tour guide.

45
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:14,586
Et trois, the Final Clash is in Paris.

46
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,797
And I speak fluent European.

47
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:20,008
Ooh-la-la, garcon, baguette,
fromage, croissant.

48
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:22,636
♪ Voulez-vous coucher avec moi?

49
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:24,930
♪ Ce soir? ♪

50
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:27,307
Okay, Yoda, what's the great plan?

51
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:30,310
We've got eight weeks before the Final Clash.

52
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,145
If we've got any chance
of beating them in Paris,

53
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:34,189
we need to get the top dancers in Europe.

54
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:37,818
- The mavericks, people like us, loners.
- Genuine freestylers.

55
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,028
People with their own moves
and their own styles.

56
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:43,699
We have to track them down
and convince them to join us.

57
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:46,368
Invincible think they've seen everything.
But what we've gotta do...

58
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:48,870
- We gotta show them that they haven't.
- Exactly.

59
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,872
If we wanna pull this off,
we need the best of the best.

60
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:52,207
La creme de la creme.

61
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,001
Do you have anyone in mind?

62
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,781
Eddie!

63
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:28,970
Next.

64
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:29,197
How about it?
You wanna take down Invincible?

65
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,116
Told you.

66
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:35,370
On my time? With my crew?

67
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:39,332
- So I guess that's a no?
- Damn right it is.

68
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:43,044
Seriously? You need to get yourself
a real manager.

69
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:46,006
Breakin' Point. Still hurts, doesn't it?

70
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,966
Police!

71
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,615
Bye-bye.

72
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,996
Thank you.

73
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:49,170
Sorry.

74
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,844
- Oh!
- Ciao.

75
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:01,808
Whoa!

76
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:08,982
You, my friend, are wasting your talents.

77
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,536
We'd done it.
The perfect crew in the City of Love.

78
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,705
One big happy family.

79
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:34,883
- Ash, the food is disgusting.
- Yes, and nothing is halal.

80
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:38,511
The room sucks, the food sucks, and we
can't get sleep because of Tino snoring.

81
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:42,015
- Oi! I don't snore.
- Yes, you do.

82
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:45,393
Come on, Ash.
You're our mighty leader, right?

83
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:48,355
- Do something.
- Guys, guys, leave Ash alone.

84
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:50,482
- You want food?
- Yes.

85
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:52,567
Fill your boots.

86
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:55,445
If there's a problem,
I'm the manager, come see me.

87
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:58,031
Problem 101.

88
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:01,326
- Toilet's blocked.
- Yeah, he's right.

89
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,494
- Toilet's blocked.
- Disgusting.

90
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:05,914
- Okay, Okay. Guys, quiet.
- ...is dirty.

91
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:08,458
Look, I understand conditions
are really rough.

92
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:11,002
But we've got a place to stay, we've got food.

93
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,171
- Yes, but...
- I'm working on the halal.

94
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,883
But we've only got six weeks
before the Final Clash.

95
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:21,429
So we've got to pull together as a crew
so we can win this.

96
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:26,017
- You still wanna win this, right?
- Yes!

97
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,353
- Yes, we wanna win.
- Let's eat.

98
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:35,151
I can't even believe that we got
every single person that we wanted.

99
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:38,071
- We are so on the money.
- Exactly, so on the money.

100
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:41,491
Now we got all the right ingredients
to take down Invincible, I'll tell you that.

101
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:42,742
All except one.

102
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:51,376
- Really funny.
- We've gotta think outside the box.

103
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:54,796
Well, there's outside the box
and then there's a whole other planet.

104
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,423
You'll see.

105
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:58,758
Please get us a drink.

106
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:00,593
Excusez.

107
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:07,392
Can I have une biere
et une Manu special, s'il vous plait?

108
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,480
Deux, trois, cinq...

109
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,567
Seize. Seize!

110
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:18,778
While Eddie struggled
with his terrible French,

111
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:22,240
I struggled with how on earth
Latin was going to help us beat Invincible

112
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,451
in a street dance battle.

113
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,917
And then I saw.

114
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,631
Hey! Oh, come on, help us out.
We're only a few Euros short.

115
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,637
Tell you what, if you can stay in the ring
for one dance with her,

116
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:28,556
I give you the drink.

117
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:31,100
- You speak English.
- Better than you, my friend.

118
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:36,856
- Wait, what do you mean, "stay in the ring"?
- If you can keep up with her for one dance.

119
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,901
- Like a battle?
- If you like.

120
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,403
Don't spill my drink.

121
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:51,496
Oi!

122
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:54,249
I'm sorry.

123
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:06,052
Best of luck.

124
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:24,696
Okay.

125
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,833
I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name.

126
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:48,803
Eva.

127
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:10,343
- You're absolutely amazing.
- I'm kind of busy.

128
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,299
That's what I call a battle.

129
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:01,978
Lucien, bye.

130
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:04,313
- I'll see you tomorrow. Bye!
- Okay.

131
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,275
Wish me luck!

132
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:11,279
Hi, again.

133
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:13,740
Hi.

134
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,451
I wanted to ask you something.

135
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:18,411
No, thank you.

136
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,580
You don't even know what it is yet.

137
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:24,292
Yeah, but I don't drink
and I'm not hungry, so good night.

138
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,502
Why do you dance?

139
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:31,799
I mean, I dance to have a good time,
have a laugh, show off.

140
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:35,136
But I made a real fool of myself recently
in front of a lot of people and...

141
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,638
- Should I start playing the violin?
- No.

142
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:40,725
'Cause my story has a happy ending.

143
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,643
I met you.

144
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,480
You know, I've heard some
cheesy pick-up lines in my time,

145
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,690
but this one beats them all.

146
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:50,443
Join my crew.

147
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,653
- Quoi?
- My street dance crew.

148
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:56,783
We're going to the Final Clash.
It's the biggest battle in Europe.

149
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:59,327
I'm happy doing my own thing.

150
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:03,831
We could come up with a whole new style,
like a fusion of Latin and street,

151
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,626
something that nobody has ever seen before.

152
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:11,089
So you want me to join a street dance crew,
dancing a style that hasn't been invented yet?

153
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:15,384
- Pretty much, yeah.
- You're an escaped crazy guy, right?

154
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:18,596
I prefer dreamer, but sure.

155
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:25,269
I tell you what, you bring me
this great crew and I'll think about it.

156
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:28,564
- Is that a promise?
- No, that's a "think about it".

157
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:32,610
That's good enough for me.

158
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:40,868
You were right, she is absolutely perfect.

159
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:44,163
With her and those moves,
Invincible won't even stand a chance!

160
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:45,373
Let me just get this clear.

161
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,417
This is a Latin-street-dance fusion
we're talking about here,

162
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:50,211
not an Ash-Eva fusion.

163
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,964
- Eva. That sounds really beautiful.
- Focus, Ash.

164
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,883
- We've still got to convince the crew.
- But they'll love the tango!

165
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:58,136
- Salsa!
- Salsa, tango, whatever.

166
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:02,640
Look, we'll show her the crew,
she'll love 'em, bam, we're unbeatable.

167
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,066
Bonjour.

168
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:14,485
It's that crazy guy again.

169
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:16,904
And my crew.

170
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:25,037
Oh, mon Dieu. This is not a refugee camp.

171
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:26,956
- Uncle, it's okay.
- We're closed.

172
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,374
It's okay.

173
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:30,418
You said you'd think about it.

174
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:32,420
Well, let's see what they can do.

175
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:34,130

I'm the reason I should last

00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:18,776
This is something we could be a part of.

213
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,027
"We"?

214
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:22,989
Me and my dance partner.

215
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:24,240
Lucien.

218
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:35,876
All right, playtime is over, thank you.

219
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:38,337
- Ciao.
- Listen up.

220
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:42,717
We've only got six weeks to get ready
for the Final Clash.

221
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:47,722
And if we want to win this, we gotta
come up with something that is so different

222
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:50,391
that Invincible won't have an answer.

223
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:52,226
Eva, Lucy...

224
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:53,769
Lucien.

225
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:56,731
Right. Lucien.

226
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:58,983
Take the floor.

227
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,207
Stop.

228
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:19,086
That's it.
I don't want to dance for these idiots.

229
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,047
- Ooh!
- Ciao.

230
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,091
That's granny style.

231
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:27,094
This is ridiculous, Ash.

232
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:30,598
I'm a B-boy.
Don't try and make us look stupid.

233
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:42,610
That went very well.

234
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:47,823
Eva, please.

235
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:50,910
Give us a chance.

236
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,746
Your friends have no manners.

237
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:55,122
I know, I know.

238
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:59,085
But they're good guys. It's just...
Street dance is all about front and reputation.

239
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:01,128
They just don't want to lose face.

240
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:02,797
But they don't...

241
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:04,799
They don't know what you do yet.

242
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:06,467
Well, go figure it out.

243
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:12,515
You see, a good idea is just an idea...

244
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:13,891
Until you make it work.

245
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:15,601
We're here to battle.

246
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:16,811
The crew couldn't understand

247
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:20,272
why I wanted the best street dancers
in Europe to do Latin.

248
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:22,483
But I wasn't giving up without a fight.

249
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:24,443
You guys are so stuck on what you know.

250
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:28,572
I had to persuade the crew to come back
to the club with me one more time.

251
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:35,830
All right?

252
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,181
Latin dance is vicious.

253
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:46,687
We hear you, man.

254
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:54,361
Thank you.

255
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:57,364
Well done.

256
00:26:58,199 --> 00:27:01,243
I think we're definitely on again.

257
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:05,456
What makes you think
I want any more to do with you?

258
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:09,710
Well, you liked what you saw earlier
and you can see how this might work.

259
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:12,379
Pretty sure of yourself, aren't you?

260
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:15,215
I gotta be. I'm the leader of this thing.

261
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:19,470
Teach us some of it.

262
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:27,561
Then I want you in bed.

263
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:32,066
Your first lesson starts at 9:00.

264
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:33,817
In the morning.

265
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:40,449
If we were going to beat Invincible
at the Final Clash,

266
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:42,785
Eddie's Latin idea had to work.

267
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:44,244
For the first time in my life,

268
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:47,081
I was going to have to learn
how to dance with someone.

269
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:49,291
One, two, three and step.

270
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:53,462
Fingertips.

271
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:58,133
- One, two, three...
- Stop jiggling your shoulders.

272
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:03,430
Turn me a little bit slower.
No, okay, stop. You're showing off.

273
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:04,765
I'm just dancing.

274
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:07,351
No. You want to look good.
Get applause from the crowd.

275
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:11,105
But listen. You're not dancing with them,
you're dancing with me.

276
00:28:11,147 --> 00:28:12,314
Again.

277
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:14,692
No. Reach out your hand.

278
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:18,612
Good.

279
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:21,240
This is a tough crowd.

280
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:24,868
Listen, salsa is not about
the choreography or the steps.

281
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,496
It's about the passion.

282
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:30,374
You have to feel it, mean it.

283
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:32,918
Yeah?

284
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,129
- Feel it?
- Yes.

285
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:36,547
Okay.

286
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:39,508
And one, two, three.

287
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:42,511
Good.

288
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:45,431
Now cross-body lead.

289
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:48,142
What are you doing?

290
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:50,936
We don't have that much time. I'm just...

291
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:55,149
Just teach me one of those tricks
that I can use against Invincible.

292
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:58,861
The basics first.
You've got a battle to prepare for.

293
00:28:58,945 --> 00:29:02,281
If I can't trust you with the simple stuff,
how am I gonna trust you with the tricks?

294
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,534
I'm sorry.

295
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:16,712
Relax.

296
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:23,385
So I guess dinner is out of the question?

297
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:27,806
Good...

298
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,851
Good. Now cross-body lead.

299
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:32,770
Good.

300
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:34,188
Better.

301
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:38,650
Two times. And... Yeah.

302
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:40,652
Okay, good. Let's leave it there.

303
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:44,698
Um, Uncle, remember Ash?

304
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:46,533
Hard to forget.

305
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:47,993
Ash, Manu.

306
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:49,369
- Hello.
- Hi.

307
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:52,915
I'm going to be working with him.
It's okay to practise here, right?

308
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:54,541
Yeah, of course.

309
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:57,085
And his friends too?
They're practising in their hostel.

310
00:29:57,545 --> 00:29:58,837
Sure. Why not?

311
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,134
- Thank you. I really appreciate that.
- My pleasure.

312
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:05,385
Well, I should probably head back

313
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,762
- and tell them the good news.
- Mmm.

314
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:08,722
- I'll see you out.
- Thank you.

315
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:12,726
- Eva's really incredible.
- Mmm.

316
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:13,852

Sorry. Let's just try it again.

387
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:38,283
Dance with your heart, not with your head.

388
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:42,954
You're still thinking like a soloist.

It's about channelling your passion.

395
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:19,866
It's about precision,

control,

397

399
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:58,113
Tango is a shared language.

400
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,415
There are no secrets...

401
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,420

00:37:57,733 --> 00:37:58,858
Good.

405
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:02,195
Remember how that felt next time we dance.

406
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,947
I'll never forget.

407
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:09,160
I'm sorry if I've been a bit...

408
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:11,162
Unfriendly?

409
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:13,999
Over-professional.

410
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,461
Maybe we could have dinner.

411
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:23,675
It wouldn't hurt our dancing
to get to know each other a little better.

412
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:28,763
Smells great.

413

No, Uncle, he is a two.

415
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:38,606
Definitely a one.

416
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:41,484
Would somebody mind
explaining to me what's going on?

417
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:43,361
Uncle has a way ofjudging men.

418
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:44,946
It never fails.

419
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:48,742
He can tell what sort of man you are
by how many chillies you eat.

420
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:51,786
You are a one.

421
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:56,041
- So how many chillies do you usually have?
- Four...

422
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:00,879
- Serve it up.
- Ash? Seriously.

423
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:02,756
- Bon.
- He'll take two.

424
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:04,549
- Four.
- He'll take two.

425
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:09,346
- Ah!
- Ash, you don't have to prove anything.

426
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:11,848
No, no, no. No. I like hot food.

427
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:14,768
- I actually love hot food. It's great, yeah. Bon.
- Bon.

Only a couple of days till Final Clash.

498
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:05,178
I think we've nailed it!
I think we've got the crew to beat Invincible!

499
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:07,346
I couldn't have done it without you.

500
00:46:07,389 --> 00:46:08,765
Shut up.

501
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:10,892
I see you've been
working your magic with Eva!

502
00:46:10,976 --> 00:46:13,728
I did not. It's strictly professional.

503
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:15,188
- Strictly professional?
- Yeah.

504
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:16,689
You mean a strictly professional date,

505
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:20,193
under the strictly professional moonlight
in the most romantic city on Earth.

506
00:46:20,235 --> 00:46:22,653
We'll just have dinner
and we're gonna talk about the routine.

507
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:24,655
Talk about the routine.

508
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:30,119
You know, just imagine Vince's face
when you and Eva drop that Latin fusion.

509
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:35,124
Trouble was, I could imagine
Vince's face, all too clearly.

510
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:38,711
I knew he'd be in Paris by now,
preparing for the Final,

511
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:42,298
and I couldn't shake the memory
of my popcorn humiliation.

512
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:51,516
You're quiet tonight.

513
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:53,726
I'm just thinking.

514
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:57,688
What if people don't get it?

515
00:46:58,607 --> 00:47:01,025
I mean, our street Latin fusion.

516
00:47:02,611 --> 00:47:05,738
Dancing when it's just us is one thing but...

517
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:08,282
In a street dance battle, I just don't...

518
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:10,409
Do you really wanna do this?

519
00:47:10,744 --> 00:47:12,078
Yes.

520
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:13,913
Then you shouldn't back away.

521
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,583
I'm here because I believe in it...

522
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:18,918
And you.

523
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:22,588
Come dance.

524
00:47:22,756 --> 00:47:23,631
- Come!
- No.

525
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:24,590

00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:29,512
Okay, you win.

Think I get it now.

547
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:51,237
With me it's always been my time to shine

548
00:49:51,279 --> 00:49:54,407
and my big chance to show 'em all but...

549
00:49:55,617 --> 00:49:58,494
Dancing with a partner, it's all about...

550
00:49:58,578 --> 00:50:01,080
It's all about sharing the moment.

551
00:50:05,585 --> 00:50:07,753
From now on we share.

552
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:17,847
Hey, nice tattoo, by the way.

553
00:50:29,484 --> 00:50:31,819
- Hello?
- Yo, Ash, guess what?

554
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:34,447
I bumped into our old friends The Surge
and they've challenged us

555
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:36,449
to an underground battle.

556
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:38,993
The Surge wants to battle, mate.

557
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:42,621
I... I don't know.
I think we should focus on the Final.

558
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:44,040
- We've only got...
- We're on.

559
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:45,124
- We...
- Hang on,

560
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:46,417
is that Eva?

561
00:50:46,626 --> 00:50:49,045
It's the perfect opportunity
to practise our fusion!

562
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:51,380
We've only got two days
before the Final Clash.

563
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:54,258
Okay, Eddie, where is it?

564
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:11,645
Come on!

565
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:17,568
Yes!

566
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:23,485
Move. Forward!

567
00:55:50,263 --> 00:55:51,430
Whoo!

568
00:56:11,659 --> 00:56:14,078
Hey, look, it's Popcorn Boy.

569
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:19,458
Hey, yo, Popcorn Boy, fall on your ass again.

570
00:56:20,168 --> 00:56:21,335
Make us laugh.

571
00:56:36,935 --> 00:56:38,310
Go into the B section!

572
00:56:41,314 --> 00:56:42,940
Five, six, seven!

573
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:49,696
Way to go, Popcorn Boy.

574
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:55,702
I guess we'll be seeing you in the Final...

575
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:57,162
That is if you still have a crew.

576
00:57:14,347 --> 00:57:15,806
Eva! Eva, wait!

577
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:18,225
Just wait a minute! Wait, wait.

578
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:20,644
What happened to sharing the moment?

579
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:23,397
Why did you leave me hanging back there?

580
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:25,023
I can't explain it.

581
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:26,525
Well, try!

582
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:30,946
It just felt wrong to throw
the couples thing at them.

583
00:57:32,907 --> 00:57:33,991
You got scared.

584
00:57:34,033 --> 00:57:36,493
No, no. I just wasn't sure, okay?

585
00:57:36,536 --> 00:57:39,496
It was a street dance battle,
and we were winning.

586
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:42,207
Look, the Latin thing was a great experiment.

587
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:44,877
I just don't think that it's gonna work.

588
00:57:45,044 --> 00:57:47,379
An experiment? Latin thing?

589
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:49,840
Is that what I am to you,
a little Latin experiment?

590
00:57:49,883 --> 00:57:50,966
I didn't mean that.

591
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:52,885
I let you into my world,
my uncle's world.

592
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:55,262
Where we shared things with you.
You throw it back in my face!

593
00:57:55,388 --> 00:57:56,388
I didn't mean...

594
00:57:56,681 --> 00:57:59,349
Work out what you do mean, little boy!

595
00:58:18,411 --> 00:58:20,412
So what the hell happened last night?

596
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:22,748
Latin was your idea
and now you're just dropping it!

597
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:25,125
- And what about Eva?
- She and Manu are like family.

598
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:27,419
First you drop her, then who's next?

599
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:29,129
Him, me, or her?

600
00:58:29,214 --> 00:58:31,215
Seriously, you can't just do that
without telling us!

601
00:58:31,257 --> 00:58:33,675
We are a crew! Next time we decide together!

602
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,302
There won't be a next time.

603
00:58:35,428 --> 00:58:36,678
- Huh?
- What?

604
00:58:38,097 --> 00:58:39,556
It's over.

605
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:44,436
You guys said this was a bad idea
from the start and you were right.

606
00:58:45,396 --> 00:58:47,814
- For what it's worth, I'm really sorry.
- What?

607
00:58:47,982 --> 00:58:49,441
- Just gonna give up?
- We could have kicked ass.

608
00:58:50,235 --> 00:58:52,361
- So what are we supposed to do?
- Go home.

609
00:58:52,445 --> 00:58:53,946
- Go home?
- What?

610
00:58:54,072 --> 00:58:55,948
I thought you said he was a champion!

611
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:04,623
You know, I never figured you for a loser.

612
00:59:12,131 --> 00:59:13,590

613
00:59:14,842 --> 00:59:16,385
