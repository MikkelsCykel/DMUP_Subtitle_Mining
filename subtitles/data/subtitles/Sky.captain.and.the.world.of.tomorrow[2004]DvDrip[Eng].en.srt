<i>Attention. Please prepare
for docking procedure.</i>

2
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,100
<i>There's a package for you,
Miss Perkins.</i>

3
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,000
They didn't leave a name.

4
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,000
- Said it was important.
- Thank you.

5
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,100
I don't like this business
you're getting yourself into.

6
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:07,900
I'll be just fine, Mr. Paley.
You know what a careful girl I am.

7
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,900
I move my mouth, words come out,
you don't hear.

8
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:17,500
- I'm late for a movie.
- I don't like it when you smile at me.

9
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,200
You don't like my smile?

10
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,600
I don't like what's behind it.

11
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:26,600
Listen, Polly, six scientists are missing,
probably dead.

12
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:30,500
Somebody out there means business.
I don't want you in the middle of it.

13
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,800
It's only a movie, Mr. Paley.

14
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,500
I'll bring you some popcorn.

15
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,300
<i>Toto, I have a feeling
we're not in Kansas anymore.</i>

16
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,100
<i>We must be over the rainbow.</i>

17
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,900
You sent me this?

18
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,400
Who are you?

19
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,500
- What's this all about, Mr...?
- Doctor.

20
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,500
Dr. Walter Jennings.
I'm a research chemist.

21
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,800
I specialize in nucleic-acid emissions.

22
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,000
The bonding enzymes
in proteus molecules which--

23
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,700
The missing scientists.
You said you knew who was next.

24
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,100
Yes, I--

25
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,300
I have a deadline to meet, doctor.

26
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:27,600
I was one of seven scientists
chosen to serve in a secret facility

27
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:31,700
stationed outside of Berlin
before the start of the First World War.

28
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:36,300
<i>It was known only as Einheit Elf,
"Unit 11."</i>

29
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,700
We agreed never to discuss
what went on behind those doors.

30
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,800
The things we were made
to do there...

31
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,000
Terrible things.

32
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:50,200
<i>- I shouldn't have come.
- Now I know we're not in Kansas.</i>

33
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,700
<i>Are you a good witch
or a bad witch?</i>

34
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,700
Doctor, you said you knew
who was next.

35
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,500
Yes.

36
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,300
Don't you see?

37
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:04,200
- There is only one left.
- Who? Who is it, doctor?

38
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,900
Me.

39
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,700
He's coming for me.

40
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,500
Who? Who's coming?

41
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,800
Totenkopf.

42
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,200
It's Totenkopf.

43
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,800
There!

44
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,300
<i>All citizens, attention.</i>

45
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,300
<i>New York City
must be evacuated at once.</i>

46
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,600
<i>Proceed in an orderly manner
to the East River Drive.</i>

47
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:01,500
<i>All members of the police and fire
department on leave or off duty</i>

48
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,000
<i>shall report immediately to their
precincts or company command.</i>

49
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,600
<i>This is urgent.</i>

50
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,600
<i>- Editor Paley.
- Mr. Paley, it's me, Polly.</i>

51
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,900
What's going on? They're calling
for midtown to evacuate.

52
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,700
<i>Listen, Mr. Paley,
I don't have much time.</i>

53
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,600
I need you to dig up anything you can
on a Dr. Walter Jennings

54
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,000
and someone named Totenkopf.

55
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:28,000
An address, a phone number,
anything you can find. It's important.

56
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,000
Totenkopf. Who is he?

57
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,900
<i>He may have something to do
with the missing scientists.</i>

58
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,600
Quick as you can.

59
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,900
Polly, listen to me.
I want you to get out of there.

60
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,200
I want you to put the phone down,
close your notepad

61
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,600
and get the hell out of there.

62
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,300
Wait a minute.

63
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:46,300
I can see something now coming
into sight above the Palisades.

64
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:49,100
They're crossing Sixth Avenue.

65
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,300
Fifth Avenue.

66
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,700
They're a hundred--
They're a hundred yards away.

67
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,900
Polly. Polly!

68
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,500
Oh, my God.

69
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,900
Polly!

70
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,100
Polly!

71
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,000
<i>Polly!</i>

72
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,100
Stop! Come back!

73
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,600
Fire!

74
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,300
Get out of here!

75
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,300
They've broken through the perimeter.
Send reinforcements.

76
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,300
Send everything you've got!

77
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,100
Emergency protocol 90206. Calling
Sky Captain. Come in, Sky Captain.

78
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:07,600
<i>Repeat. Calling Sky Captain.
Come in, Sky Captain.</i>

79
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,900
<i>This is an emergency
protocol, 90206.</i>

80
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,500
<i>Calling Sky Captain.
Sky Captain, do you read?</i>

81
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,100
<i>Calling Sky Captain.
Come in, Sky Captain.</i>

82
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,900
<i>This is an emergency
protocol, 90206.</i>

83
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:22,200
<i>Calling Sky Captain.
Sky Captain, do you read?</i>

84
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:26,400
<i>Repeat. Calling Sky Captain.
Come in, Sky Captain.</i>

85
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,800
This is Sky Captain. I'm on my way.

86
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,900
Polly.

87
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,500
Joe.

88
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,300
<i>Further details of the attack
continue to pour in.</i>

89
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:11,500
<i>The central portion of the city is
blacked out from radio communication</i>

90
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,200
<i>due to damaged power lines
and electrical failure.</i>

91
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:17,200
<i>Cables received from English, French
and German news agencies</i>

92
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,400
<i>now confirm the attack
was not limited to the city.</i>

93
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,700
<i>The BBC is reporting
that a steel mill in Nuremberg</i>

94
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,200
<i>was virtually excavated</i>

95
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:28,900
<i>by what witnesses describe
as a mechanized tornado.</i>

96
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,100
<i>News agencies in Paris and Madrid
speak of strange burrowing machines</i>

97
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,400
<i>rising from the ground,</i>

98
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,400
<i>robbing entire communities
of their coal and oil reserves.</i>

99
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:42,500
<i>Meanwhile, with military resources
stretched thin across the globe,</i>

100
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,600
<i>world leaders
must once again call upon</i>

101
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:48,600
<i>the elite mercenary forces
of Sky Captain and his army-for-hire</i>

102
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:53,000
<i>to uncover the meaning
of these mysterious events.</i>

103
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,600
Where's Dex?

104
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,200
Shazam.

105
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,400
I thought you said this thing was big.
Can I have it?

106
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:51,500
You find out where it came from,
and I'll buy you one for Christmas.

107
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,600
Oh, I need to show you something.

108
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I recorded this signal just before
the first machine appeared.

109
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,100
I didn't think anything of it
until I played it back.

110
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,100
- Morse code?
- See, that's what I thought at first,

111
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,000
but the syntax
is more complex than that.

112
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,600
There's a sub-carrier hidden
in the lower frequency.

113
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,700
I think it's being used
to control them.

114
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,500
If it shows up again,
could you track it?

115
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,200
I can try, yeah.

116
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,700
- Good boy, Dex.
- Thanks.

117
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:21,400
In the meantime,
see what you can do with that thing.

118
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,800
Find out what makes it tick.

119
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,600
- You don't mind, do you?
- I don't mind.

120
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:31,800
I wanna know where it comes from,
Dex. Who sent it here.

121
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:41,200
<i>Switch to map coordinate
69 SW by 49 E.</i>

122
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,900
Tummy ache?

123
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,200
How you been, Joe?

124
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,300
- Miss me?
- Get out.

125
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,700
Well, it's nice to see you too.

126
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,300
Dex said you might be in a mood.

127
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,800
Dex?

128
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,200
Get in here!

129
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:30,500
It's been three years, Joe.
You're not still mad at me, are you?

130
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,300
Can't even remember
what we were fighting about.

131
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,000
You sabotaged my plane.

132
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,800
Right.

133
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,400
I spent six months in a Manchurian
slave camp because of you.

134
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,200
- They were gonna cut off my fingers.
- Joe,

135
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,000
for the last time, I didn't sabotage
your damn airplane.

136
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:51,200
All so you could get a photograph
of Tojo Hideki

137
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,800
in his bathrobe, remember?

138
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,300
You know, I'm starting to think

139
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,400
that you've invented
this whole sabotage nonsense

140
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,700
to cover the fact that
you were running around on me

141
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,300
with your little mystery girl
the whole time we were in Nanjing.

142
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,600
Never happened.
All in your imagination.

143
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,700
Who was she, Joe?

144
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,400
- What was her name?
- That's enough.

145
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,000
What are you gonna do?

146
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,800
Shoot me?

147
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:17,100
Oh, great. We all made up.

148
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,500
It's been a pleasure, Polly.

149
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,600
Let's do it again in ten years.
Escort Miss Perkins off the base, Dex.

150
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,500
If she resists, shoot her.

151
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,900
- Hi, Polly.
- Hi, Dex.

152
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,200
- I gotta...
- It's okay, hon, I know.

153
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,800
Okay.

154
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:35,300
It's just as well. I guess you wouldn't
have been interested in this, anyway.

155
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,700
- Where did you get that?
- There's more where this came from.

156
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,600
Lots more.

157
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:48,600
- I want that blueprint, Polly.
- I want this story, Joe.

158
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:51,000
And you're gonna help me get it.

159
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,900
Maybe we should show her, Cap.
Maybe she can help.

160
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,800
Show me what?

161
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,100
Show me what?

162
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,100
My God. What is this?

163
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,900
Where do they come from?

164
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,400
They started appearing three years ago
in remote areas.

165
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,100
We managed to keep it a secret
until now.

166
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,700
They show up without warning,
they take what they need,

167
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,300
and then they disappear
without a trace.

168
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,500
Three years and we still can't explain
what they want

169
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,000
or who's sending them here.

170
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,800
A man came to see me today,
a scientist.

171
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:43,100
He was terrified.
Said someone was coming for him.

172
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:46,400
I asked him who he was so afraid of,
and he repeated one name:

173
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,000
Totenkopf.

174
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,000
He nearly went white
when he said it.

175
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,300
Totenkopf, who is he?

176
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,800
He's the invisible man.

177
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:58,500
I've been through every library record
twice looking for anything.

178
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,900
I've called every contact I have
from Paris to Bangkok.

179
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,600
This is the only thing I could dig up.

180
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,800
He ran some kind of secret
science unit outside of Berlin

181
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,600
before the start of World War I.

182
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,900
Something called Unit 11.

183
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,100
It's been more than 30 years
since anyone has spoken his name.

184
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,300
Until today.

185
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,300
Note the insignia he used
for the unit.

186
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,700
It matches the markings
on all of these machines.

187
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:29,800
The scientist, where is he now?

188
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:33,400
We're in this together, right, Joe?

189
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,400
Nothing gets published until I say so.
You don't write a sentence

190
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:42,200
or take a photograph without
asking me first. Understood?

191
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,600
Understood.

192
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,700
What?

193
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,200
I missed you.

194
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,500
Thanks for saving my life today,
by the way.

195
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,000
Were you down there?

196
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:15,000
You missed me too. How nice.

197
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:21,200
This is it. This is Jennings' lab.

198
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:32,400
Dr. Jennings? It's Polly Perkins.

199
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,000
Dr. Jennings!

200
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,800
It's locked.

201
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,600
That window there.

202
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,500
I may be able to get in
through that window

203
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,600
if I can attach a line...

204
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
It's open.

205
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,100
We're too late.
Someone beat us here.

206
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,100
All right, Polly...

207
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,900
...no more games.
What the hell is going on?

208
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,700
I was hoping you could tell me.

209
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,000
Dr. Jennings!

210
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,000
You must stop him!

211
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,800
Stay here.

212
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,200
Stop!

213
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,600
I don't wanna hurt you.

214
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,800
- Miss Perkins.
- I'm here, doctor.

215
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:07,400
- I'm going to get you some help.
- You must promise.

216
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,100
If Totenkopf finds them,
the countdown will begin.

217
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:14,800
- This world shall end.
- I don't understand, doctor. Find what?

218
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,800
Promise.

219
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,500
He's dead.

220
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,600
I think I found something.

221
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:42,200
Dr. Jennings had this with him
this morning at the theater.

222
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:50,300
- I'd better get back to the base.
- I'm coming with you.

223
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,900
Of course you are.

224
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:10,300
Reconnaissance picked up something
on radar traveling at over 500 knots

225
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,600
and coming straight for us.

226
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:14,800
- How long before they reach us?
- There!

227
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,400
Get my plane ready. I'm going up.

228
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,400
- What are you doing?
- I'm coming with you.

229
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,300
Don't be stupid. Remember what
happened last time you flew with me?

230
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,300
- We had a deal.
- This is not a game, Polly.

231
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,600
- People are gonna die.
- You are not leaving me, Joe.

232
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,000
Not this time. This is my story,
and we had a deal!

233
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,100
Go, go, go!

234
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,600
Get in.

235
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,000
There you are.

236
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,800
- Cap, this is Dex, do you read me?
- Hang on, Dex, I'm a little busy.

237
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,800
Come in, Dex.

238
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:51,200
Look, whatever you do, don't shoot!

239
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,800
- Okay.
- You shot it, didn't you?

240
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,700
<i>- Yes.
- Listen, Cap,</i>

241
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,100
the signal's coming
from one of those machines.

242
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,500
You gotta keep them
in one piece.

243
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,000
Which machine is it, Dex?

244
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:08,000
<i>There's no way of telling.
It could be any one of them.</i>

245
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:12,800
I think I found it, Dex.

246
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:24,000
- Wait, Cap, I'm losing the signal.
- It's heading for the city.

247
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,600
Don't let it get away. I need you
to bounce that signal back to me.

248
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,200
If we lose it now,
we may never get it back.

249
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,500
You let me know when
you've got something, Dex.

250
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,900
<i>I'll let you know. Out.</i>

251
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,500
All right, I want a full-spectrum sweep
of every incoming signal.

252
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,100
Amplify any variant frequency cycle
and route them to me.

253
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,100
They've come back
for the generators.

254
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,200
Who is this guy?

255
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,900
- You okay?
- Great.

256
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,600
There's a bottle of Milk of Magnesia
under the seat if you need it.

257
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:16,000
- I'm fine.
- You don't look so good.

258
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,200
Pull up!

259
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,400
- Joe!
- I see it!

260
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,200
It's getting away.

261
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:45,300
- I lost the signal, Cap.
- I'll find him, Dex. Sit tight.

262
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:50,700
- Go left.
- Sit back, Polly.

263
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:55,100
There's a shortcut down Broadway.
You can catch him on 42nd Street.

264
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,500
I know these streets like the back
of my hand. Go left!

265
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,100
Hey!

266
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,400
Okay, okay, now go straight.

267
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,600
- No, no, no, go right!
- When?

268
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,800
Back there.

269
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:28,400
I could use a little more warning
next time.

270
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,500
Go left!

271
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:37,300
Tell me you got something, Dex.

272
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,200
<i>We're getting clobbered up here.</i>

273
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,900
It's no picnic down here either, Cap.
Hang in there, I've almost got it.

274
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,000
Joe!

275
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,100
Dex! We can't hold them off
any longer!

276
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,900
- I'm almost there.
- We have to evacuate now!

277
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,100
Go ahead without me.
I'm right behind you.

278
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,500
- Lovely.
- Okay, turn left at the drugstore.

279
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,700
- Left again.
- We're going around in circles.

280
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,000
Will you just trust me? Go left!

281
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,500
- It's a dead end.
- That's not supposed to be there.

282
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,600
It's a dead end!

283
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,100
There's no way out!

284
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,600
Oh, bugger.

285
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,000
Joe!

286
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:08,700
- There's the lead ship.
- Shortcut!

287
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,500
I got us here, didn't I?

288
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:17,500
- Dex. Dex!
- Thirty seconds, Cap, that's all I need.

289
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,400
- Thirty seconds.
- Plus or minus.

290
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:24,500
Listen, I'll try and take them out over
the water, buy us some time. Over.

291
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,100
Still glad you came?

292
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,800
Joe, I found it! Joe!

293
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,200
<i>Dex, come in. Where is it?</i>

294
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:55,500
<i>Come in, Dex. Are you there? Dex?</i>

295
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,900
<i>Dex, do you read me?</i>

296
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,500
<i>Dex, are you there?</i>

297
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,100
I can't outrun them much longer.

298
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,300
Hold on.

299
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,500
Joe, what are you doing?
You're heading straight down!

300
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:56,100
- You're gonna kill us!
- I know what I'm doing. Just hold on.

301
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:59,000
We're going too fast.
We're not gonna make it.

302
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,600
Joe, you have to pull up!

303
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,400
Pull up!

304
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:31,400
- We went underwater.
- Dex rigged it up.

305
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,300
Got the idea from one
of his comic books.

306
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,900
You mean, you knew this
the whole time,

307
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,700
and you let me think
we were gonna crash?

308
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,600
I thought we were gonna die!
You should have said something!

309
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:54,900
Look, Polly, it was your idea
to tag along, not mine.

310
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,900
If you can't take it,
that's not my fault.

311
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,300
Oh, I can take it.

312
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:04,300
- I can take anything you dish out.
- Good.

313
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,700
Because that was nothing.

314
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:25,000
Dex, come in. Do you read me?

315
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:29,000
Do you read me, Dex? Copy.

316
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,400
Dex!

317
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,800
Dex!

318
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,900
Dex.

319
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,300
They're everywhere.

320
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:24,000
Joe, look out!

321
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,400
Dex!

322
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,700
Why would Totenkopf do this?

323
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:28,100
Why Dex?
It doesn't make any sense.

324
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:37,100
He was looking for something.

325
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,700
Dex said he knew where
the transmission was coming from.

326
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,600
He must have got too close.

327
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,100
- He was trying to tell me something--
- Joe.

328
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,100
Good boy, Dex.

329
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:13,000
These journals belong to Dr. Vargas.

330
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:17,000
He must have passed them on to
Dr. Jennings before his disappearance.

331
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,500
- My God.
- What?

332
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:23,100
"Totenkopf was awarded his first
patent when he was 12 years old.

333
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,600
By 17, he had already received
two doctorates

334
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:29,900
and was one of the most highly
regarded minds of his day.

335
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
One year after his disappearance,
ominous rumors began circulating.

336
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Whispers that Totenkopf
had begun work

337
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:39,500
on what was darkly hinted
to be a doomsday device.

338
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,900
Efforts to locate him
have consistently failed,

339
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,600
and to this day, his whereabouts
remain a mystery.

340
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,100
Even less is known
about his companion,

341
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,400
an assassin who controls
his machines."

342
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,000
She's the one who took Dex.

343
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,600
What else?

344
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,500
These are Unit 11 supply logs.

345
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,600
This is everything he's used
his machines to collect

346
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:07,200
for the last three years,
including generators from the city.

347
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,200
It reads like a shopping list
from all over the world.

348
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,400
What have you been up to, doctor?

349
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:29,100
It'll be all right, Joe.
Dex can look after himself.

350
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,900
We'll find him.

351
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:13,500
My old friend Joe.

352
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:14,400
- So glad to see you again.
- It's good to see you too, Kaji.

353
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:16,700
- So glad to see you again.
- It's good to see you too, Kaji.

354
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,400
This is Polly Perkins.
She'll be coming with us.

355
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,200
Nice to meet you.

356
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:29,400
- Kaji, did you get the maps I needed?
- Yeah, they're inside.

357
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,300
Did you get a little something
for me?

358
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:35,600
Of course. Three cases,
just like you asked.

359
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:40,400
Vienna sausages.
My God, it's been so long.

360
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,500
Kaji, how's your Tibetan?

361
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,000
Come, I'll show you the maps.

362
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:58,000
- How well do you know him?
- Kaji?

363
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:02,000
He's old legion.
Reconnaissance. Why?

364
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:03,600
I don't trust him.

365
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:06,500
That's funny, he said
the same thing about you.

366
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:11,600
Here. Get changed.
Your clothes stay behind.

367
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:14,500
You won't be needing high heels
where we're going.

368
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:27,100
Dex tracked the signal to here,
this valley north of Karakal.

369
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,600
This is where
the transmission originated.

370
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:32,200
Why is there no writing here?
What is this place?

371
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:36,100
- Shambhala.
- You know it?

372
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:37,800
It is forbidden.

373
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:41,600
It's said to be the source
of the Kalachakra, Tibetan magic.

374
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:44,300
Those who live there are said
to have supernatural powers.

375
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,200
You can get us there, Kaji,
can't you?

376
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:49,500
No one has ventured this far.
It's very dangerous.

377
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,100
Shambhala is said to be protected by
the priests of the Kalachakra lamasery.

378
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:56,900
If they find us there,
they will kill us.

379
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:59,300
Why? Why is this place so special?

380
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:03,200
Shambhala is known by many names.
To the Hebrew, it is Eden.

381
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:06,100
To the ancient Greek,
it was Empurios.

382
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:09,300
You may know it as Shangri-la.

383
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:18,800
A storm is coming. If you still wish
to go, we must go now.

384
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,500
I need to send a message.

385
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:30,300
<i>Editor Paley, this may be the last
message you receive from me.</i>

386
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:34,200
<i>We've tracked a radio signal to Nepal
in search of Dr. Totenkopf.</i>

387
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:37,000
<i>The story grows stranger
at every turn.</i>

388
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:40,300
<i>Clues about a countdown.
But to what, I don't know.</i>

389
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,900
<i>I fear time is running out.</i>

390
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:45,500
<i>With any luck, I'll be back soon
with Dex and the story.</i>

391
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:49,000
<i>I hope. Polly Perkins.</i>

392
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:17,700
This is where civilization stops.

393
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,700
A blank on the map.

394
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,300
We must be careful from here.

395
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:27,500
Hurry.

396
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:53,600
What is it?

397
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:56,100
It looks like a mining outpost.

398
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:58,800
Something bad happened here.

399
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:04,600
Seems to be abandoned.

400
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:06,900
Tell your men we're heading down.

401
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:09,700
I want a closer look.

402
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:52,800
What is it, Joe?

403
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:54,100
Uranium.

404
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:57,000
The whole mine's contaminated.

405
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:58,800
- We can't stay here.
- Let's go.

406
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:01,300
Where's Polly?

407
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:07,500
Polly!

408
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:09,700
Miss Perkins?

409
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:16,900
We'll have to split up.

410
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,100
Polly!

411
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:29,900
Let her go.

412
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,800
Give me the vials
and the girl will live.

413
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:36,400
What vials?
What are you talking about?

414
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:40,100
I will not ask a second time.

415
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,500
Drop the gun.

416
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:53,000
I told you, I don't know what you're
talking about. You'll just have to kill us.

417
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,300
As you wish.

418
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:58,200
Wait! Wait. Wait.

419
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:08,800
I'm sorry, Joe.

420
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,200
Goodbye, my friends.
Your journey ends here.

421
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,700
I was going to tell you, Joe.
You have to believe me.

422
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:29,300
- What was in those vials?
- I don't know.

423
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:33,700
- You expect me to believe that?
- I'm telling the truth, Joe.

424
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:36,100
Dr. Jennings gave them to me
just before he died.

425
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:39,000
He said that the world would end
and the countdown would begin

426
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:40,900
if Totenkopf got his hands on them.

427
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:45,300
You've done nothing but lie to me
from the beginning.

428
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:50,400
Okay, I'm a liar. But I don't exaggerate.
That is what he said.

429
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,900
That was what Totenkopf
was looking for.

430
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:56,400
- That's why he took Dex.
- I'm sorry.

431
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:59,000
I never meant for any of this
to happen.

432
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,500
Do you hear that?

433
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:18,600
Dynamite.

434
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,000
That noise again.

435
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:32,600
Move!

436
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:47,800
What are you doing?

437
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:52,400
Come on!

438
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:55,600
Oh, great.

439
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:57,400
We're safe.

440
00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:00,600
Polly, this may be
our last moment together.

441
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:02,600
There's something
I need to ask you.

442
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:03,900
Yes, Joe?

443
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:08,700
Did you cut my fuel line?

444
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:13,200
Damn it! I didn't sabotage
your lousy airplane!

445
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:16,200
Our last moments on earth
and this is all you have to say to me?

446
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:18,500
Could we just for once die
without all this bickering?

447
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:32,900
There you are.

448
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,500
- Why did you lock the door?
- Run!

449
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:37,700
My film.

450
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:41,100
Polly, leave it!
There's no time!

451
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:58,600
Polly.

452
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:02,000
Polly.

453
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:30,500
My clothes.

454
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:35,300
What are you doing in here?
Get out. Get out!

455
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:38,100
Not unless you have some pants
hidden under there for me.

456
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:42,200
- Oh, don't tell me you're--
- Naked.

457
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:46,600
- You can say it, Polly.
- This isn't funny, Joe.

458
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:51,600
Where are we? What happened to us?
Where are our clothes?

459
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,400
Stop looking at me like that.

460
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:59,000
Like what?

461
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:02,700
Turn around, Joe.

462
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,700
I'm serious. Turn around.

463
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:12,800
Hi, Joe.

464
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:35,000
Ask him what he did
with our clothes.

465
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,300
The clothes are burned.

466
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:41,300
Burned? Why?

467
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,400
He says the mine is poisonous.

468
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:47,600
Our clothes were infected.

469
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:54,200
He says he's arranged for a guide
to lead us back down the mountain.

470
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:56,800
He will take us there
once we are dressed.

471
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:00,100
We appreciate that. But explain to him
we are here to find a man.

472
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:08,500
He says we must leave
before it is dark.

473
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:10,100
There's nothing more
he can do for us.

474
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:13,400
It's very important we find this man.

475
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:15,200
His name is Totenkopf!

476
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
He says, what do you want
with this man?

477
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:24,000
I've come to kill him.

478
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,800
And to find my friend.

479
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:32,400
He says he will help you.

480
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:43,600
What do you think?

481
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:49,600
I think they burned
the wrong clothes.

482
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:53,000
You said I couldn't bring
anything else.

483
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:55,000
I think you look like
a woolly mammoth.

484
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:57,300
They're waiting for us.

485
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:02,200
The priest says that Totenkopf
enslaved his people,

486
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:04,300
made them work in the mine,
but the mine was poisonous.

487
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:07,300
Those who did not die right away
were brought here for him to study.

488
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:09,400
Where is Totenkopf now?

489
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:13,500
He does not know. Only that
Totenkopf is gone, many years ago.

490
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:20,100
I can't believe this is happening.

491
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,600
I only have two shots left.

492
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:28,600
We're in Shangri-la
and all I have is two shots.

493
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:30,000
Everything I had was in that bag.

494
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,600
You should have let me go back
for my film.

495
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:34,100
You're right, I should have.

496
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:40,900
So where's he taking us?

497
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:45,600
To meet the only living survivor
of Totenkopf's experiments.

498
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:47,300
What experiments?

499
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:03,400
Ask him, where is Totenkopf?
Tell him it's important we find him.

500
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:12,500
He wants to know why.
Why do you seek Totenkopf?

501
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:15,600
To make him pay
for what he has done.

502
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:28,900
His staff. He's asking for his staff.

503
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:34,200
He says, follow Rana. The staff
will lead you there to Totenkopf.

504
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:38,800
Rana? Is there such a place?

505
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,400
He says now that he has helped you,
you must help him.

506
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:49,200
Of course. Anything.

507
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:55,200
What do you want?

508
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:01,400
Kill me.

509
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:14,500
Have you looked at this?
There's markings on it, like a ruler.

510
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:18,500
And there's a moon and a star.

511
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:26,600
<i>And all I ask is a tall ship</i>

512
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:30,600
<i>and a star to steer her by</i>

513
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:33,300
A star.

514
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:36,600
He wasn't talking about a place,
he was talking about a star!

515
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:38,700
Rana is a star.

516
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Ancient sailors used to navigate
by using the night sky.

517
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:46,800
They could determine their position
by the moon and the stars.

518
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:48,200
The Vikings were known
to create maps for certain stars,

519
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:50,900
The Vikings were known
to create maps for certain stars,

520
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,800
latitude tables that required a key
to decipher them.

521
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:58,400
The key was called Jacob's staff.
This has to be the key!

522
00:56:58,400 --> 00:56:59,900
You mean this could really work?

523
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,800
You could really find Totenkopf
with this thing?

524
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:04,900
We do things a little
different nowadays.

525
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,000
All we needed to know was where
to look. What's the date?

526
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:09,800
- March 2.
- March 2.

527
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:14,000
Using Karakal Plateau
as our assumed position...

528
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:16,700
March 2...

529
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:23,000
Rana is at latitude 20.40.

530
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:30,400
Right ascension, 03 hours,
43 minutes.

531
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:35,300
Declination, minus 10.60.

532
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:42,300
There's nothing there.

533
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,600
Are you sure you did it right?

534
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:46,400
I'm sure.

535
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,900
If the old man was right,
that's where Totenkopf is now.

536
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,100
Dead center in the middle
of nowhere.

537
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:03,800
What's that point there?

538
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:05,700
That's where we run out of fuel.

539
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:07,500
Oh, great.

540
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:10,800
So how do we get there?

541
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:17,000
- Franky.
- Who?

542
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,400
Frank Cook. An old buddy of mine.

543
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:22,800
Runs a mobile reconnaissance outpost
for the Royal Navy.

544
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:26,100
If I can get a message to them,

545
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:29,000
I may be able to arrange a rendezvous
at these coordinates.

546
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,500
And what if they don't
get the message?

547
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:34,700
Franky's never let me down.
They'll be there.

548
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:37,900
They'll be there.

549
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,600
Is that light supposed to be on?

550
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:57,200
Relax, Polly, everything's fine.

551
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:01,800
- We're out of fuel, aren't we?
- Buckle up.

552
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:06,700
Manta Station, do you read me?

553
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:09,500
Where are you, Franky?

554
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:15,700
What are you doing?

555
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:18,900
You can't land this
in the middle of nowhere.

556
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:21,600
I'm not. I'm landing it on that.

557
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:25,700
- What is it?
- It's a mobile airstrip.

558
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:27,500
Dex had a hand in designing it.

559
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:30,900
It's kind of a secret. You can keep
a secret, can't you, Polly?

560
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,100
Yeah.

561
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:34,700
I can keep a secret.

562
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:42,300
Two shots.

563
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:46,900
<i>Permission to land on platform 327.
Maintain your present course.</i>

564
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:48,900
Copy, 327.

565
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,200
<i>Welcome aboard, captain.</i>

566
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:33,000
Joseph Sullivan.
I was sure you'd be dead by now.

567
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:37,200
It's good to see you too, Franky.

568
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:41,600
This had better be important
or one of us is in trouble.

569
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:42,700
It's important.

570
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:47,700
What is that?

571
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:54,800
You be nice.

572
01:00:55,900 --> 01:00:58,600
Commander Cook,
meet Polly Perkins.

573
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:02,200
Polly Perkins.
I've heard so much about you.

574
01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:04,400
It's a pleasure to finally meet
the competition.

575
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:08,600
It's been a long time since Nanjing,
hasn't it, Joseph?

576
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:15,100
So, Franky, I hear you've been having
trouble with that number-three engine,

577
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:17,000
or at least you were last time--

578
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:19,500
Commander, we're tracking six
enemy submersibles

579
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:21,600
bearing 30 degrees northwest.

580
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:25,200
<i>- Who wants to kill you now?
- Man your battle stations.</i>

581
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:26,700
<i>- All hands on deck.
- Follow me.</i>

582
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:38,300
Take us to 10,000 feet
and deploy countermeasures.

583
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:39,400
Yes, commander.

584
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:42,000
Reconnaissance located an island

585
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:44,900
3 kilometers northeast
of our current position.

586
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:47,400
It is not, however,
on any of our charts.

587
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:49,500
- That has to be him.
- That has to be who?

588
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:53,800
What have you got me
into this time, Joseph?

589
01:01:53,900 --> 01:01:55,800
Nothing you can't handle, Franky.

590
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:00,300
Polly, try not to touch anything.

591
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:04,700
Enemy warships bearing 316,
mark 4. Closing fast.

592
01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:07,900
- Give me a visual.
- Launching radio imager.

593
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:20,800
We're receiving a signal.
On-screen now.

594
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,400
Totenkopf.

595
01:02:31,700 --> 01:02:35,200
Commander, we've lost power to the
forward rotors. We're losing altitude.

596
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:38,500
All engines, reverse full.
Get us out of here.

597
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,900
Francesca, you've got to get me
on that island.

598
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:44,100
I'm not about to risk the lives
of my men for one of your silly antics.

599
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:46,200
He's got Dex.

600
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:50,000
Rescind order!

601
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:55,400
You'll never make it from the air.
We have to find you another way.

602
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:02,100
There's a tidal flow on the eastern face
of the island.

603
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:05,500
It's too deep.
We're not rated past 300 meters.

604
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,300
But...

605
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:09,900
...this area here,

606
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,700
there's an undersea inlet
at the southern tip

607
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:16,300
and it runs beneath the entire length
of the island. That is your only way in.

608
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:18,500
Everything else is sheer rock
to the edge of the water.

609
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:21,000
What about those machines?
How do we get past them?

610
01:03:21,100 --> 01:03:22,500
Leave that to me.

611
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:26,600
Alert the amphibious squadron.

612
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:33,300
<i>Report to main station carrier.</i>

613
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:10,700
What?

614
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:12,000
Nanjing?

615
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,300
I can't hear you, Polly.

616
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:17,000
You'll have to speak up.

617
01:04:37,300 --> 01:04:40,800
<i>Keep your nose up, Joseph. You
always were bad at the short takeoff.</i>

618
01:04:40,900 --> 01:04:43,600
Keep up, Franky. I don't wanna
have to come back for you.

619
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:49,300
I thought your takeoff was just fine.

620
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:50,700
Thank you, Polly.

621
01:04:50,900 --> 01:04:52,800
So you heard that, did you?

622
01:04:56,700 --> 01:04:59,900
<i>Manta leader to Manta team,
impact in ten seconds.</i>

623
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,700
Switching to amphibious mode.

624
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:13,500
Impact in five, four, three,

625
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:15,800
two, one.

626
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:41,900
Franky.

627
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:45,200
<i>You remember our milk run
over Shanghai, don't you?</i>

628
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:47,700
<i>We had the target buttoned up
and he was jinxing in the flak.</i>

629
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:51,100
- Pops a rivet, thinks he's taken a hit.
- And started yelling:

630
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:52,600
<i>- "Protect the rabbits!"
- "Protect the rabbits!"</i>

631
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:55,200
<i>- "Protect the rabbits!"
- "Protect the rabbits!"</i>

632
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:10,300
Enemy target spotted four points
to the right. Depth, 1,600. Look sharp.

633
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:24,300
Joe, watch out!

634
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:07,400
- Joseph, there's the inlet.
- I see it.

635
01:07:10,700 --> 01:07:13,900
Get ready to make a run for it.
We're about to clear you a path.

636
01:07:19,700 --> 01:07:21,700
Hold on, now, Polly.
Hold on.

637
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,700
Manta leader to Manta team,

638
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:27,100
arm cluster torpedoes
and stick close to element formation.

639
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:30,500
Fire.

640
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:46,300
Joseph! Pull up!

641
01:07:57,900 --> 01:08:00,400
Joseph, it's still alive. Disengage.

642
01:08:02,700 --> 01:08:04,600
Do you hear me? Disengage.

643
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:06,600
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

644
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:09,600
<i>- What is it?
- Do you hear me? Pull up!</i>

645
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:12,400
- The rudder's jammed. I can't steer.
- Joseph!

646
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:16,500
Disengage!

647
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:35,400
- Thank you, Franky. That was close.
- Get ready to make a run for it.

648
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:36,900
<i>You're only going to have
one shot at this.</i>

649
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Franky, what are you doing?
This is no time to show off.

650
01:08:39,100 --> 01:08:41,100
- She's heading straight for it.
- On my mark.

651
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:43,000
- She's going to ram it.
- It's suicide.

652
01:08:43,100 --> 01:08:45,000
Franky, pull up.

653
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:48,300
- Three.
- Pull up, Franky.

654
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:49,900
Two.

655
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:51,300
One.

656
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:06,700
You're all clear.

657
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:09,100
<i>Good luck, Joe.</i>

658
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:12,000
Thank you, Franky.
We'll take it from here.

659
01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:14,400
She's some kind of girl.

660
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:16,600
Yes, I know.

661
01:09:37,300 --> 01:09:39,200
I'm taking us up.

662
01:10:31,100 --> 01:10:32,500
What?

663
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:41,600
- What is it?
- One of Totenkopf's creatures.

664
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:00,000
- You're not gonna photograph that?
- I've only got two shots left.

665
01:11:00,100 --> 01:11:02,300
Who knows what's waiting for us
out there.

666
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:04,400
Suit yourself.

667
01:11:06,700 --> 01:11:10,100
There's a clearing up ahead.
Totenkopf can't be far.

668
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:33,300
Run.

669
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:45,600
There.

670
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:03,000
Polly!

671
01:12:09,300 --> 01:12:10,900
Oh, great.

672
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:13,900
Come on!

673
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:16,900
Polly!

674
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:20,300
Come on!

675
01:12:29,700 --> 01:12:30,600
Are you mad?

676
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:31,400
Are you mad?

677
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:35,800
Are you completely insane?
You could have gotten yourself killed!

678
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:42,800
- It's okay.
- No, it isn't.

679
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:45,200
- I didn't mean--
- I shot the ground!

680
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:49,100
- What?
- When we were running,

681
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:52,100
I shot the ground.

682
01:12:56,300 --> 01:12:58,200
It isn't funny.

683
01:13:00,100 --> 01:13:05,200
I only have one shot left.
One shot!

684
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:14,400
What is it with you
and that stupid camera, anyway?

685
01:13:14,900 --> 01:13:16,400
You gave it to me.

686
01:13:19,300 --> 01:13:20,900
You don't even remember, do you?

687
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:24,700
You were flying with the American
volunteers in Nanjing,

688
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:27,400
I was covering the evacuation
of Shanghai.

689
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:29,600
- I remember.
- Joe, I wanna ask you something

690
01:13:29,700 --> 01:13:31,100
and I want you to tell me the truth.

691
01:13:31,300 --> 01:13:35,100
I don't care one way or the other,
I swear. I just need to know.

692
01:13:35,500 --> 01:13:37,200
The girl in Nanjing was Franky,
wasn't it?

693
01:13:37,300 --> 01:13:40,300
- Polly.
- How long were you seeing her?

694
01:13:41,900 --> 01:13:42,900
Look me in the eyes.

695
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:46,800
I never fooled around on you.

696
01:13:46,900 --> 01:13:47,900
Never.

697
01:13:50,700 --> 01:13:52,600
I sabotaged your plane.

698
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:56,000
- Three months.
- I knew it!

699
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:58,900
I can't believe I ever trusted you,
you lousy--

700
01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:05,000
He's here.

701
01:14:15,300 --> 01:14:17,000
You all right?

702
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:33,600
Through there.

703
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,000
Through there.

704
01:15:38,900 --> 01:15:40,300
My God, Joe.

705
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:43,200
It's an ark.

706
01:15:43,300 --> 01:15:45,700
He's building an ark.

707
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:57,000
What are you doing?

708
01:15:58,900 --> 01:16:01,600
You honestly think you're gonna
find something more important

709
01:16:01,700 --> 01:16:04,800
than every single creature on Earth
being led two by two

710
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:07,100
inside a giant rocket ship?

711
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:09,300
I might.

712
01:16:10,700 --> 01:16:13,200
- Like what?
- I'll know when I see it.

713
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:24,500
<i>- Ten minutes to liftoff.
- They've started the countdown.</i>

714
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:27,000
We have to find Totenkopf.

715
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:37,900
You've got a gift.

716
01:17:02,300 --> 01:17:03,900
- Dex!
- Hurry, get in!

717
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:09,700
<i>Einsteigen. Komm, springt!</i>

718
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:18,400
Are you all right?
How did you find us?

719
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:20,700
We escaped into the tunnels
once the countdown started.

720
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:23,400
Some of the scientists were caught.
They didn't make it.

721
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:27,400
The machines that were guarding us

722
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:29,400
are loading everything on this island
into that ship.

723
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:31,800
We've got about ten minutes
to stop that thing from blasting off.

724
01:17:34,300 --> 01:17:36,700
Dex! Get us out of here!

725
01:17:58,900 --> 01:18:00,300
Good boy, Dex.

726
01:18:01,100 --> 01:18:02,300
Thanks, Cap.

727
01:18:06,700 --> 01:18:08,500
- Who are they?
- They're Unit 11.

728
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:09,700
Or what's left of them.

729
01:18:09,900 --> 01:18:12,900
They were brought here to finish
what they started 30 years ago.

730
01:18:12,900 --> 01:18:14,200
Finish what?

731
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:15,500
Tell them.

732
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:18,700
Totenkopf believed that humankind
was doomed to extinction,

733
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:20,400
so he proposed the unthinkable:

734
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:23,900
To build a vessel that would carry
the building blocks of a new civilization

735
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,000
into space.

736
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:27,100
He used his machines
to collect specimens

737
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:28,900
representing all life on Earth.

738
01:18:29,100 --> 01:18:30,700
What Totenkopf called
"The World of Tomorrow."

739
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:33,600
Those vials that Dr. Jennings
gave me, what were they?

740
01:18:33,700 --> 01:18:36,000
Adam and Eve.
Totenkopf's masterpiece.

741
01:18:36,100 --> 01:18:38,400
Seeds of a technological utopia.

742
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:39,900
We smuggled them off this island,

743
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,800
knowing Totenkopf
would never leave without them.

744
01:18:41,900 --> 01:18:45,400
But now that he has them again,
there is nothing left to keep him here.

745
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:48,200
Then let him go. Let him go
where he can't harm anyone.

746
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:50,900
No, no, no, that ship
must never leave this Earth.

747
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,900
Why? What haven't you told us?

748
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:56,200
When the rocket reaches 100
kilometers, at the edge of space,

749
01:18:56,300 --> 01:18:59,000
- Earth will be incinerated.
- How do we stop it?

750
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:01,900
Only Totenkopf can stop it now. But
we've never been allowed near him.

751
01:19:01,900 --> 01:19:04,000
He's too well guarded
even to be seen.

752
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:06,800
- Where is he?
- We're on our way, Cap.

753
01:19:06,900 --> 01:19:08,100
Good boy, Dex.

754
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,200
Careful. Careful.

755
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:19,000
Hurry, they'll be coming for us.

756
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:25,800
Through there.
That's the only way in.

757
01:19:25,900 --> 01:19:29,200
You see, there is no way past them.

758
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:31,600
Five minutes, Joe.

759
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:34,400
- Wait here.
- You'll be killed.

760
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:36,900
He knows what he's doing.

761
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:40,500
I think.

762
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:46,100
Hey, that's my gun!

763
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:52,600
- Dex?
- Try shaking it.

764
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:03,700
- We must hurry.
- Don't do it, you idiot!

765
01:20:03,700 --> 01:20:05,000
Doctor, stop!

766
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:24,100
<i>Who dares come before me?</i>

767
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:26,500
<i>Who dares enter this place?</i>

768
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:29,800
<i>What has begun
cannot be stopped.</i>

769
01:20:29,900 --> 01:20:33,300
<i>- The time for this world is over.
- Totenkopf.</i>

770
01:20:33,300 --> 01:20:34,500
Hello, doctor.

771
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:36,200
Why are you doing this?

772
01:20:36,300 --> 01:20:39,300
<i>I have been witness to a world
consumed by hatred</i>

773
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:41,700
<i>and bent on self-destruction.</i>

774
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:45,100
<i>Watched as we have taken
what was to be a paradise</i>

775
01:20:45,100 --> 01:20:48,400
<i>and failed in our responsibilities
as its steward.</i>

776
01:20:48,500 --> 01:20:51,700
<i>I know now that the course
the human race has set for itself</i>

777
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:53,800
<i>cannot be changed.</i>

778
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:58,200
<i>I am the last, desperate chance
for a doomed planet.</i>

779
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:00,900
<i>Now, leave this place or die!</i>

780
01:21:07,300 --> 01:21:09,600
- Is it safe?
- Well, there's only one way to find out.

781
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:22,000
I meant throw something.

782
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:44,500
He's not here.

783
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:46,400
We're too late.

784
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:48,200
These are his personal papers.

785
01:21:48,300 --> 01:21:51,800
He would never leave without them.
He must still be here.

786
01:21:51,900 --> 01:21:54,600
- We must find him.
- I found him.

787
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:10,000
It's impossible.

788
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:12,400
It can't be.

789
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:16,000
The last entry in his journal
was made on October 11, 1918.

790
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,600
He died over 20 years ago.

791
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:26,000
We've been chasing a ghost.

792
01:22:38,100 --> 01:22:40,500
<i>Three minutes to liftoff.</i>

793
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:48,700
They never stopped. They're finishing
what they were programmed to do.

794
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:54,200
Don't you see? This entire island
is Totenkopf. Every wire, every gear.

795
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:57,100
He's found a way to cheat
even his own death.

796
01:22:57,200 --> 01:23:00,200
So how do we kill somebody
who's already dead?

797
01:23:02,100 --> 01:23:03,800
- How do I stop it?
- Nothing can stop it now.

798
01:23:03,900 --> 01:23:06,300
- There must be some way.
- His machines would never allow it.

799
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:08,700
Leave the machines to me.
Dex, show me what to do.

800
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:14,100
If you can cut the lead
in the system terminal,

801
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:16,500
it should create a short...

802
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:21,100
...which will ignite the fuel line
before the booster engines can fire

803
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:23,000
- and destroy the atmosphere.
- That's it?

804
01:23:24,300 --> 01:23:27,700
- That's all I have to do?
- The terminal's onboard the rocket.

805
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:30,100
You won't have time to escape.

806
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:35,400
Contact Franky as soon
as you're off the island.

807
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:38,200
- She'll know exactly what to do.
- What are you talking about?

808
01:23:38,300 --> 01:23:40,900
- I'm going with you.
- Not this time.

809
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
We had a deal.

810
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:46,600
You're not gonna leave me now,
just when things are getting interesting.

811
01:23:49,300 --> 01:23:53,000
- I won't let you.
- I wish we had more time.

812
01:23:53,100 --> 01:23:56,300
And I only hope, one day,
you can forgive me.

813
01:24:04,700 --> 01:24:07,200
- Take care of her, Dex.
- Good luck, Cap.

814
01:24:14,300 --> 01:24:16,700
<i>One minute to liftoff.</i>

815
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:32,500
We meet again,
my mysterious friend.

816
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:36,700
How do you wanna do this?

817
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:43,800
Nice shot, Polly.

818
01:25:53,700 --> 01:25:55,900
What took you so long?

819
01:26:00,100 --> 01:26:01,200
She's a machine.

820
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,700
<i>Ten seconds to liftoff.</i>

821
01:26:11,100 --> 01:26:12,400
<i>Nine...</i>

822
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:13,800
<i>...eight...</i>

823
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:15,500
<i>...seven...</i>

824
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:16,900
<i>...six...</i>

825
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:18,300
<i>...five...</i>

826
01:26:18,500 --> 01:26:20,100
<i>...four...</i>

827
01:27:07,300 --> 01:27:09,000
We've gotta get those animals
off the ship.

828
01:27:09,100 --> 01:27:11,300
<i>Ninety kilometers to booster ignition.</i>

829
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:12,700
There's no time.

830
01:27:16,900 --> 01:27:18,500
That's our only way across.

831
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,400
<i>Eighty kilometers to booster ignition.</i>

832
01:27:34,100 --> 01:27:37,700
<i>Danger! Danger! Danger!
Cargo release imminent!</i>

833
01:27:38,100 --> 01:27:39,800
What did you do now?

834
01:27:43,700 --> 01:27:44,700
Come on!

835
01:27:44,900 --> 01:27:47,500
<i>Seventy kilometers to booster ignition.</i>

836
01:27:59,700 --> 01:28:01,600
<i>Sixty kilometers to booster ignition.</i>

837
01:28:04,700 --> 01:28:06,300
Hold on!

838
01:28:12,700 --> 01:28:16,500
Please! Don't touch anything else!

839
01:28:24,100 --> 01:28:26,600
There's no time. We'll never make it.

840
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:30,300
<i>Fifty kilometers to booster ignition.</i>

841
01:28:37,700 --> 01:28:38,700
Run!

842
01:28:40,100 --> 01:28:42,500
<i>Forty kilometers to booster ignition.</i>

843
01:28:49,800 --> 01:28:52,100
Come in, Manta station.
Do you read me?

844
01:28:54,500 --> 01:28:57,300
<i>Thirty kilometers to booster ignition.</i>

845
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:03,400
Franky, it's Dex. Do you read me?

846
01:29:12,200 --> 01:29:13,100
It didn't work.

847
01:29:16,500 --> 01:29:18,500
<i>Twenty kilometers to booster ignition.</i>

848
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:22,200
Joe, you're running out of time.
You've gotta do something.

849
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:27,500
<i>And God saw that the wickedness
of man was great in the earth...</i>

850
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:30,500
<i>- He thinks he's God.
- And God said unto Noah, the end...</i>

851
01:29:30,500 --> 01:29:31,800
Shut up!

852
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,600
<i>Ten kilometers to booster ignition.</i>

853
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:36,000
<i>Nine...</i>

854
01:29:36,900 --> 01:29:38,300
<i>...eight...</i>

01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:39,500
<i>...seven...</i>

856
01:29:39,900 --> 01:29:42,400
<i>- ...six...
- Why won't you die?</i>

857
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:44,700
<i>Five kilometers to booster ignition.</i>

858
01:29:46,100 --> 01:29:47,800
<i>Four...</i>

<i>...two...</i>

861
01:29:52,900 --> 01:29:54,200
<i>...one.</i>

862
01:29:58,400 --> 01:30:00,700
<i>Warning. System failure.</i>

863
01:30:00,900 --> 01:30:02,600
<i>Booster malfunction.</i>

<i>Danger.</i>

866
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:08,700
<i>Warning. System failure.</i>

867
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:10,100
<i>- Booster malfunction.
- Look!</i>

868
01:30:10,300 --> 01:30:11,600
<i>Danger. Danger.</i>

869
01:30:11,900 --> 01:30:14,600
- What is it?
- It might be our way out of here.

870
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:33,400
I see them, commander.

871
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:37,800
Ready assault teams.
All hands on deck.

872
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:29,400
One shot.

873
01:31:32,300 --> 01:31:34,000
You got your story.

874
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:52,500
Polly.

875
01:31:53,900 --> 01:31:54,900
- You...
- It's all right.

876
01:31:55,100 --> 01:31:57,400
You don't have to say anything.

877
01:31:59,900 --> 01:32:01,700
Lens cap.
