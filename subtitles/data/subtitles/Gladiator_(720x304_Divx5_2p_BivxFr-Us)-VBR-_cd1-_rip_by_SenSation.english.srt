1
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,220
- Sir.
- General.

2
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,100
Sir.

3
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,230
Lean and hungry.

4
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,020
- Still nothing?
- Not a sign.

5
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,870
- How long has he been gone?
- Nearly two hours.

6
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,560
- Will they fight, sir?
- We shall know soon enough.

7
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:56,220
Soldier, I ordered you
to move those catapults forward.

8
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,750
- They're out of range.
- Range is good.

9
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:03,070
- The danger to the cavalry...
- Is acceptable. Agreed?

10
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,950
They say no.

11
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,990
Steady! Steady!

12
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,540
People should know
when they're conquered.

13
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,660
Would you, Quintus?

14
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,940
Would I?

15
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,210
- Strength and honor.
- Strength and honor.

16
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:21,950
At my signal,
unleash hell.

17
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,280
Load the catapults.

18
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:47,900
Infantry form up for advance.

19
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,710
- Archers ready.
- Archers!

20
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,560
Fratres!

21
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,390
Maximus!

22
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:24,510
Three weeks from now,
I will be harvesting my crops.

23
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:28,860
Imagine where you will be,
and it will be so.

24
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:32,990
Hold the line!
Stay with me!

25
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:35,610
If you find yourself alone...

26
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:38,270
riding in green fields
with the sun on your face...

27
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:42,520
do not be troubled.

28
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:46,140
For you are in Elysium,
and you're already dead!

29
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:49,880
Brothers...

30
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,820
what we do in life...

31
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,770
echoes in eternity.

32
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,570
Pull!

33
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,910
Pull! Pull!

34
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,630
Catapults ready, sir!

35
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:34,270
Archers, ignite!

36
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,890
- Ignite!
- Ignite!

37
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:44,960
Archers, draw!

38
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:48,890
Loose!

39
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,220
Loose!

40
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,420
All right, men, ready!

41
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,070
Hold the line!

42
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,000
Draw! Loose!

43
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,150
Loose! Loose!

44
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:38,620
Reload!

45
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:45,340
Hold the line!

46
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,610
Draw! Loose!

47
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:51,800
Stay with me!

48
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:59,100
Stay with me!

49
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:28,570
Roma victor!

50
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:57,340
Roma victor!

51
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,130
Do you think
he's really dying?

52
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:43,100
He's been dying
for ten years.

53
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:47,390
If he weren't really dying,
he wouldn't have sent for us.

54
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:49,340
Maybe he just misses us.

55
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:52,090
And the senators?
He wouldn't have summoned them if...

56
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:53,210
Peace, Commodus.

57
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:56,190
After two weeks on the road, your
incessant scheming is hurting my head.

58
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,530
He's made his decision.

59
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:07,900
He's going to announce it.

60
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:12,760
He will name me.

61
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:18,170
The first thing I shall do...

62
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:19,610
when...

63
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:25,240
is honor him with games
worthy of His Majesty.

64
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:29,660
For now, the first thing
I shall do is have a hot bath.

65
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:32,920
Your Highness?

66
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:38,040
We seem to be
almost there, sir.

67
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:46,360
- Sire.
- Where's the emperor?

68
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:49,470
He's at the front, sire.
They've been gone for 19 days.

69
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,220
The wounded are
still coming in.

70
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,110
My horse.

71
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,090
My lord.

72
00:13:58,590 --> 00:13:59,550
Kiss?

73
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:37,850
You have proved your valor
yet again, Maximus.

74
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:42,650
Let us hope
for the last time.

75
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:45,240
There's no one
left to fight, sire.

76
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:47,870
There is always
someone left to fight.

77
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:50,750
How can I reward
Rome's greatest general?

78
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,860
Let me go home.

79
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:01,050
Ah. Home.

80
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,540
They honor you, Caesar.

81
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,580
It's for you, Maximus.
They honor you.

82
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,930
Have I missed it?
Have I missed the battle?

83
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,290
You have missed the war.

84
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,530
Father, congratulations.

85
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,740
I shall sacrifice a hundred bulls
to honor your triumph.

86
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,720
Save the bulls.

87
00:15:57,850 --> 00:15:59,900
Honor Maximus.
He won the battle.

88
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:02,840
- General.
- Highness.

89
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:07,320
Rome salutes you,
and I embrace you as a brother.

90
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:09,240
It has been too long,
my old friend.

91
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:11,320
- Highness.
- Here, Father.

92
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:13,660
Take my arm.

93
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:17,630
I think it is time
for me to leave.

94
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:35,000
So much for
the glory of Rome.

95
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:56,540
Magnificent battle.

96
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,210
- General.
- Still alive?

97
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:24,190
- Still alive.
- The gods must have a sense of humor.

98
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,810
- The gods must love you.
- Valerius.

99
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:29,340
Back to barracks, General?
Or to Rome?

100
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,380
Home. My wife,
the son, the harvest.

101
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:36,410
Maximus the farmer.
I still have difficulty imagining that.

102
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:40,030
You know, dirt cleans off a lot
easier than blood, Quintus.

103
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:42,140
- Here he is.
- Highness.

104
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,030
Senator Gaius, Senator Falco.

105
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:47,390
Beware of Gaius. He'll pour
a honeyed potion in your ear...

106
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:50,110
and you'll wake up one day and all
you'll say is, "Republic, republic".

107
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:53,150
Well, why not?
Rome was founded as a republic.

108
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:55,930
Yes, and in a republic
the senate has the power.

109
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:58,300
But Senator Gaius isn't
influenced by that, of course.

110
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,960
Where do you stand, General?
Emperor or senate?

111
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:03,160
A soldier has the advantage
of being able...

112
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:06,040
to look his enemy
in the eye, Senator.

113
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:10,010
Well, with an army behind you,
you could be extremely political.

114
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,860
I warned you.
Now I shall save you. Senators.

115
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:24,440
Maximus.

116
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,910
I'm going to need
good men like you.

117
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:31,640
How may I be of service,
Highness?

118
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:34,490
You're a man who knows
what it is to command.

119
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:37,850
You give your orders, the orders
are obeyed and the battle is won.

120
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:42,330
But these senators scheme and squabble
and flatter and deceive.

121
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:45,820
Maximus, we must save Rome
from the politicians, my friend.

122
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:49,340
Can I count on you
when the time comes?

123
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:57,980
Highness, when your father releases me,
I intend to return home.

124
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:02,010
Home? Well, no one's earned it more.

125
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,980
Don't get too comfortable.
I may call on you before long.

126
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:10,590
Lucilla's here.
Did you know?

127
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,510
She's not forgotten you.

128
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,710
And now you're the great man.

129
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:30,140
If only you
had been born a man.

130
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:33,020
What a caesar
you would have made!

131
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:36,380
Father.

132
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:43,900
You would have been strong.

133
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,970
I wonder,
would you have been just?

134
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,560
I would have been
what you taught me to be.

135
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:53,880
How was your journey?

136
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:57,980
Long. Uncomfortable.
Why have I come?

137
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,510
I need your help.
With your brother.

138
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:02,620
Of course.

139
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,510
He loves you.
He always has.

140
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:07,100
And...

141
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,900
he will need you now
more than ever.

142
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,270
Enough of politics.

143
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:21,850
Let us pretend that
you are a loving daughter...

144
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,540
and I am a good father.

145
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:33,020
This is a pleasant fiction,
isn't it?

146
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,110
Good morning.

147
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,990
I need three more horses.

148
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,730
Two! Three!

149
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,650
Four!

150
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:17,340
One! Two!

151
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:34,270
You sent for me, Caesar?

152
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:42,620
- Caesar?
- Tell me again, Maximus.

153
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:45,470
Why are we here?

154
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:48,320
For the glory of the empire, sire.

155
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:49,820
Ah, yes.

156
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,150
Ah, yes, I remember.

157
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,400
Do you see that map, Maximus?

158
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:01,440
That is the world
which I created.

159
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:04,700
For 25 years...

160
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:09,400
I have conquered, spilt blood,
expanded the empire.

161
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:13,240
Since I became caesar,
I've known four years without war.

162
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:15,550
Four years of peace in 20.

163
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:17,500
And for what?

164
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:27,960
I brought the sword.
Nothing more.

165
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:30,590
Caesar, your life...

166
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:33,630
Please.
Please don't call me that.

167
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:36,320
Come. Please.

168
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:38,520
Come sit.

169
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:41,820
Let us talk together now...

170
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,930
very simply... as men.

171
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:49,080
Maximus, talk.

172
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:55,320
Five thousand of my men are
out there in the freezing mud.

173
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,690
Three thousand of them
are bloodied and cleaved.

174
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:59,770
Two thousand will never
leave this place.

175
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:02,170
I will not believe that they
fought and died for nothing.

176
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:04,090
And what would you believe?

177
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:07,320
They fought for you and for Rome.

178
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,150
And what is Rome?

179
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,500
I've seen much
of the rest of the world.

180
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:17,370
It is brutal and cruel and dark.
Rome is the light.

181
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,390
Yet you have
never been there.

182
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,790
You have not seen
what it has become.

183
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,760
I am dying, Maximus.

184
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:26,680
When a man sees his end...

185
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:30,170
he wants to know there was
some purpose to his life.

186
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:33,720
How will the world speak my name
in years to come?

187
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:36,030
Will I be known
as the philosopher?

188
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,530
The warrior?

189
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:38,970
The tyrant?

190
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:45,080
Or will I be the emperor who
gave Rome back her true self?

191
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:48,090
There was once a dream
that was Rome.

192
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:51,100
You could only whisper it.

193
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:54,110
Anything more than a whisper
and it would vanish...

194
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:56,220
it was so fragile.

195
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:59,870
And I fear that it will not
survive the winter.

196
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:03,550
Maximus...

197
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:06,430
let us whisper now...

198
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:08,600
together, you and I.

199
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:10,300
You have a son.

200
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,020
Tell me about your home.

201
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:24,410
My house is in the hills
above Trujillo. A very simple place.

202
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:28,700
Pink stones
that warm in the sun.

203
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:32,600
A kitchen garden that
smells of herbs in the day...

204
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,490
jasmine in the evening.

205
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:38,940
Through the gate
is a giant poplar.

206
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,720
Figs, apples, pears.

207
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:45,080
The soil, Marcus... black.
Black like my wife's hair.

208
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:48,600
Grapes on the south slopes,
olives on the north.

209
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:52,410
Wild ponies play near my house.
They tease my son. He wants to be one.

210
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:57,280
- Remember the last time you were home?
- Two years, 264 days and this morning.

211
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:01,050
I envy you, Maximus.

212
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:04,670
It's a good home.
Worth fighting for.

213
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:10,460
There is one more duty...

214
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:13,660
that I ask of you
before you go home.

215
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:17,080
What would you
have me do, Caesar?

216
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:20,510
I want you to become
the protector of Rome after I die.

217
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:24,700
I will empower you
to one end alone...

218
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:28,860
to give power back
to the people of Rome...

219
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,960
and end the corruption
that has crippled it.

220
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:41,080
Will you accept this great honor
that I have offered you?

221
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:44,670
With all my heart, no.

222
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:49,050
Maximus...

223
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:51,960
that is why it must be you.

224
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:53,850
But surely a prefect,
a senator...

225
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:56,700
somebody who knows the city,
who understands her politics.

226
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,640
But you have not been
corrupted by her politics.

227
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,540
- And Commodus?
- Commodus is not a moral man.

228
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,750
You have known that
since you were young.

229
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:13,310
Commodus cannot rule.

230
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,550
He must not rule.

231
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:19,480
You are the son
that I should have had.

232
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:25,400
Commodus will accept my decision.

233
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:31,710
He knows that you command
the loyalty of the army.

234
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,110
I need some time, sire.

235
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,610
Yes.

236
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:43,960
By sunset,
I hope you will have agreed.

237
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,490
Now embrace me as my son.

238
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,090
And bring an old man
another blanket.

239
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,470
- My father favors you now.
- My lady.

240
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:13,980
- It was not always so.
- Many things change.

241
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:16,800
Many things.
Not everything.

242
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:21,280
Maximus, stop.

243
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:26,400
Let me see your face.

244
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:31,230
- You seem upset.
- I lost many men.

245
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:35,320
What did my father
want with you?

246
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:38,490
To wish me well
before I leave for home.

247
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:40,540
You're lying.

248
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,960
I could always tell when you were lying
because you were never any good at it.

249
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:46,430
- I never acquired your comfort with it.
- True.

250
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,990
But then you never had to.

251
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,710
Life is more simple
for a soldier.

252
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:55,580
Or do you think me heartless?

253
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,260
I think you have
a talent for survival.

254
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:06,490
Maximus, stop.

255
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:10,750
Is it really so terrible
seeing me again?

256
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:14,330
No. I'm tired from battle.

257
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:17,150
It hurts you to see
my father so fragile.

258
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:23,640
Commodus expects that my father will
announce his succession within days.

259
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:28,760
Will you serve my brother
as you served his father?

260
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:32,860
I will always serve Rome.

261
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:36,440
Do you know...

262
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:38,940
I still remember you
in my prayers.

263
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,750
Oh, yes. I pray.

264
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:49,950
I was sad to hear
of your husband's death. I mourned him.

265
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:54,810
- Thank you.
- And I hear you have a son.

266
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:59,070
Yes. Lucius.

267
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:01,880
He'll be nearly
eight years old.

268
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:04,120
My son is also nearly eight.

269
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:09,020
I thank you for your prayers.

270
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,040
Ancestors, I ask
for your guidance.

271
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:23,740
Blessed Mother, come to me
with the gods' desire for my future.

272
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:28,380
Blessed Father, watch over
my wife and son with a ready sword.

273
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:32,830
Whisper to them I live
only to hold them again.

274
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:36,120
Ancestors, I honor you...

275
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:39,960
and will try to live with
the dignity you have taught me.

276
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:03,290
Cicero.

277
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:08,350
Sir.

278
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:14,970
You don't find it hard
to do your duty?

279
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,340
Sometimes I do
what I want to do.

280
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:24,090
The rest of the time
I do what I have to.

281
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:29,560
We may not be able
to go home after all.

282
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:01,020
Are you ready to do
your duty for Rome?

283
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:04,830
Yes, Father.

284
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,930
You will not be emperor.

285
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,470
Which wiser, older man
is to take my place?

286
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:16,700
My powers
will pass to Maximus...

287
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,940
to hold in trust...

288
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:23,420
until the senate
is ready to rule once more.

289
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:28,090
Rome is to be
a republic again.

290
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:31,390
- Maximus.
- Yes.

291
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:39,480
My decision disappoints you?

292
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:45,180
You wrote to me once...

293
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:49,340
listing the four chief virtues.

294
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:53,790
Wisdom, justice...

295
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:55,390
fortitude...

296
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:57,020
and temperance.

297
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:02,140
As I read the list,
I knew I had none of them.

298
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,760
But I have other virtues, Father.

299
00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:08,220
Ambition.

300
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:12,250
That can be a virtue
when it drives us to excel.

301
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:16,730
Resourcefulness.
Courage.

302
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:19,870
Perhaps not on
the battlefield, but...

303
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:23,070
there are many forms of courage.

304
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:26,300
Devotion to my family...

305
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,830
and to you.

306
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:32,540
But none of my virtues
were on your list.

307
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:37,560
Even then it was as if
you didn't want me for your son.

308
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,750
You go too far.

309
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:46,240
I searched the faces
of the gods...

310
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:50,840
for ways to please you,
to make you proud.

311
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:53,180
One kind word...

312
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,480
one full hug...

313
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:59,130
where you pressed me
to your chest and held me tight...

314
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,130
would have been like the sun
on my heart for a thousand years.

315
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:09,210
What is it in me
you hate so much?

316
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:13,180
All I've ever wanted...

317
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:17,560
was to live up to you, Caesar.

318
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:21,080
- Father.
- Commodus.

319
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:28,250
Your fault as a son...

320
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:31,450
is my failure as a father.

321
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,130
Come.

322
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,090
Father.

323
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:05,720
I would butcher
the whole world...

324
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:08,440
if you would only have loved me!

325
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:47,000
Maximus, the emperor needs you.
It's urgent.

326
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:56,600
Lament with me, brother.
Our great father is dead.

327
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,410
How did he die?

328
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:28,190
The surgeons say
there was no pain.

329
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:30,200
His breath gave out as he slept.

330
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,890
Father.

331
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:45,660
Your emperor asks
for your loyalty, Maximus.

332
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:49,600
Take my hand.

333
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:53,150
I only offer it once.

334
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:08,120
Quintus.

335
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:58,360
Hail, Caesar.

336
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:01,080
I must talk to the senators.
I need their counsel.

337
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:03,610
Wake Gaius and Falco.

338
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:05,820
- Sword.
- Sword.

339
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:10,940
Maximus, please be careful.
That was not prudent.

340
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,880
Prudent?
The emperor has been slain.

341
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:17,050
The emperor died
of natural causes.

342
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,090
- Why are you armed, Quintus?
- Guards!

343
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:25,500
Please don't fight, Maximus.

344
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:29,400
I'm sorry.
Caesar has spoken.

345
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:32,280
Ride until dawn...

346
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:33,880
and then execute him.

347
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:36,250
Quintus, look at me.
Look at me!

348
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:39,320
Promise me that you will
look after my family.

349
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,970
Your family will meet you
in the afterlife.

350
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:08,700
Kneel.

351
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:14,110
Blessed Father,
watch over my wife and son.

352
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:16,600
Whisper to them that I live
only to hold them again.

353
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,470
At least give me a clean death.

354
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,890
A soldier's death.

355
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,990
The frost, sometimes
it makes the blade stick.

356
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:09,310
Praetorian!

357
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:31,260
- Remember the last time you were home?
- Two years, 264 days and this morning.

358
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:36,760
Blessed Father, watch over
my wife and son with a ready sword.

359
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:41,210
Whisper to them I live only to hold them
again, for all else is dust and air.

360
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:44,730
Whisper to them
I live only to hold them again...

361
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:47,710
for all else is dust and air.

362
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,360
Papa! Papa!

363
00:44:24,090 --> 00:44:25,660
Don't die.

364
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:33,820
You'll meet them again.

365
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:36,700
Not yet.

366
00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:48,670
No. They will clean it.
Wait and see.

367
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:23,070
Don't die.

368
00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:25,400
They'll feed you to the lions.

369
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:27,390
They are worth more than we are.

370
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:38,840
Better now?

371
00:45:40,030 --> 00:45:41,530
Clean. You see?

372
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:12,700
Proximo!

373
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:15,130
My old friend.

374
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:18,430
Every day is a great day
when you are here...

375
00:46:18,490 --> 00:46:22,940
but today
is your most fortunate day.

376
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:27,610
Those giraffes you sold me...

377
00:46:27,710 --> 00:46:29,240
they won't mate.

378
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:32,030
They just walk around eating...

379
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:34,140
and not mating.

380
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,770
You sold me...

381
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:37,370
queer giraffes.

382
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:40,670
- I want my money back.
- Not a chance.

383
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:45,340
I do special price for you.

384
00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:47,260
On what?

385
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:51,520
Have you seen my new stock?
Come and see them.

386
00:47:04,890 --> 00:47:07,710
Do any of them fight?
I've got a match coming up.

387
00:47:07,770 --> 00:47:10,330
Some are good for fighting,
others for dying.

388
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:12,220
You need both, I think.

389
00:47:12,350 --> 00:47:14,140
Get up.

390
00:47:21,210 --> 00:47:23,640
What's your trade?

391
00:47:23,770 --> 00:47:24,990
I was a hunter.

392
00:47:25,850 --> 00:47:28,830
I bought him from a salt mine
in Carthage.

393
00:47:28,890 --> 00:47:30,110
Sit down.

394
00:47:34,650 --> 00:47:36,760
Mark of the legion.

395
00:47:36,890 --> 00:47:39,870
- Deserter.
- Maybe so. But who cares?

396
00:47:39,930 --> 00:47:41,980
- He's a Spaniard.
- I'll take six.

397
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:43,870
- For one thousand.
- One thousand?

398
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:46,010
The Numidian alone is worth 2,000.

399
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:48,730
These slaves are rotten.

400
00:47:48,830 --> 00:47:50,840
It all adds to the flavor.

401
00:47:50,970 --> 00:47:52,160
Wait, wait. Wait!

402
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:53,630
I can negotiate.

403
00:47:54,810 --> 00:47:56,920
I'll give you 2,000...

404
00:47:57,050 --> 00:47:58,940
and four for the beasts.

405
00:47:59,070 --> 00:48:01,080
That's 5,000 for an old friend.

406
00:48:17,630 --> 00:48:20,410
Come on! How long does it take
to get into my own house?

407
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:23,130
I am Proximo.

408
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:26,040
I shall be closer to you
for the next few days...

409
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:28,510
which will be the last
of your miserable lives...

410
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:32,510
than that bitch of a mother that
brought you screaming into this world.

411
00:48:32,570 --> 00:48:36,350
I did not pay good money for you
for your company.

412
00:48:37,210 --> 00:48:40,030
I paid it so that I could
profit from your death.

413
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:45,180
And as your mother was there
at your beginning...

414
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:48,380
so I shall be there at your end.

415
00:48:49,530 --> 00:48:52,510
And when you die,
and die you shall...

416
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:56,350
your transition
shall be to the sound of...

417
00:49:00,670 --> 00:49:02,040
Gladiators...

418
00:49:03,130 --> 00:49:04,350
I salute you.

419
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:10,110
- Red.
- Red.

420
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:15,230
Yellow.

421
00:49:16,090 --> 00:49:17,660
Yellow.

422
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:29,150
Good.

423
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:30,650
- Red.
- Red.

424
00:49:35,290 --> 00:49:37,020
Spaniard.

425
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:11,160
That's enough for the moment!

426
00:50:11,290 --> 00:50:12,730
His time will come.

427
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:16,860
Next.

428
00:50:29,530 --> 00:50:30,750
Spaniard.

429
00:50:31,550 --> 00:50:33,660
Why don't you fight?

430
00:50:33,790 --> 00:50:35,320
We all have to fight.

431
00:50:49,150 --> 00:50:51,100
Is that the sign of your gods?

432
00:50:56,060 --> 00:50:57,790
Will that not anger them?

433
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:20,510
The gods favor you.

434
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:22,750
Red is the gods' color.

435
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:26,270
You will need their help today.

436
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:45,820
Some of you are thinking
you won't fight...

437
00:51:46,910 --> 00:51:48,700
and some that you can't fight.

438
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:51,930
They all say that...

439
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:53,950
until they're out there.

440
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:57,210
Listen.

441
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,190
Kill! Kill! Kill!

442
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:09,500
Thrust this
into another man's flesh.

443
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:11,770
They will applaud
and love you for that.

444
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:13,240
And you...

445
00:52:15,450 --> 00:52:17,340
you may begin to love them...

446
00:52:18,270 --> 00:52:19,610
for that.

447
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:24,990
Ultimately...

448
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:27,870
we're all dead men.

449
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:32,700
Sadly, we cannot choose how, but...

450
00:52:32,830 --> 00:52:36,090
we can decide
how we meet that end...

451
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:38,520
in order
that we are remembered...

452
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:41,880
as men.

453
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:48,730
On the left,
draw your shields!

454
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:51,610
On the right,
draw your swords!

455
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:53,660
Kill! Kill! Kill!

456
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:57,180
Pair them up...
red with yellow.

457
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:02,940
Next!

458
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:09,080
Move it!

459
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:44,440
- Go away!
- You'll never rule us, Commodus!

460
00:57:13,370 --> 00:57:18,300
He enters Rome like a conquering hero.
But what has he conquered?

461
00:57:18,430 --> 00:57:21,310
Give him time, Gracchus.
He's young.

462
00:57:21,370 --> 00:57:23,160
I think he could do very well.

463
00:57:23,290 --> 00:57:25,180
For Rome, or for you?

464
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,660
Go to your mother, Lucius.
It's what she'd like.

465
00:57:40,030 --> 00:57:41,470
Lucius!

466
00:57:41,530 --> 00:57:42,940
Mother!

467
00:57:44,570 --> 00:57:46,040
Hail, Caesar.

468
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:47,580
Senators.

469
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:53,850
Rome greets her new emperor.

470
00:57:53,950 --> 00:57:57,310
Your loyal subjects
bid you welcome, Highness.

471
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:59,230
Thank you, Falco.

472
00:57:59,290 --> 00:58:03,160
And for the loyal subjects,
I trust they weren't too expensive.

473
00:58:03,260 --> 00:58:05,210
- Caesar.
- Gracchus.

474
00:58:05,310 --> 00:58:07,580
All Rome rejoices
in your return, Caesar.

475
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:10,300
There are many matters
that require your attention.

476
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:16,600
To order, please!
To order!

477
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:21,150
For your guidance, Caesar, the senate
has prepared a series of protocols...

478
00:58:21,210 --> 00:58:24,320
to begin addressing
the many problems in the city...

479
00:58:24,410 --> 00:58:28,600
beginning with basic sanitation
for the Greek quarter...

480
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:31,640
to combat the plague
which is already springing up there.

481
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:33,440
So, if Caesar...

482
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:37,790
Don't you see, Gracchus?

483
00:58:39,130 --> 00:58:41,240
That's the very problem,
isn't it?

484
00:58:41,340 --> 00:58:44,280
My father spent
all his time at study...

485
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:49,660
at books of learning
and philosophy.

486
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:53,020
He spent his twilight hours
reading scrolls from the senate.

487
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:57,880
And all the while
the people were forgotten.

488
00:58:58,940 --> 00:59:00,730
But the senate
is the people, sire...

489
00:59:00,860 --> 00:59:03,900
chosen from among the people
to speak for the people.

490
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:07,580
I doubt many of the people
eat so well as you do, Gracchus...

491
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:10,330
or have such
splendid mistresses, Gaius.

492
00:59:10,430 --> 00:59:13,210
I think I understand my own people.

493
00:59:13,310 --> 00:59:16,890
Then perhaps Caesar will be so good
as to teach us...

494
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:19,290
out of his own extensive experience.

495
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,890
I call it love.

496
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:26,810
I am their father.

497
00:59:26,910 --> 00:59:28,700
The people are my children.

498
00:59:28,830 --> 00:59:30,620
I shall hold them to my bosom
and embrace them tightly.

499
00:59:30,750 --> 00:59:33,370
Have you ever embraced someone
dying of plague, sire?

500
00:59:40,220 --> 00:59:42,940
No, but if you interrupt me again...

501
00:59:43,930 --> 00:59:45,370
I assure you that you shall.

502
00:59:45,470 --> 00:59:48,280
Senator,
my brother is very tired.

503
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:50,720
Leave your list with me.

504
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:53,280
Caesar shall do
all that Rome requires.

505
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:55,390
My lady, as always...

506
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:58,200
your lightest touch
commands obedience.

507
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:07,360
Who are they to lecture me?

508
01:00:07,450 --> 01:00:09,880
Commodus, the senate has its uses.

509
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:12,920
What uses?
All they do is talk.

510
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:15,870
It should be just...

511
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:16,920
you and me...

512
01:00:17,020 --> 01:00:18,140
and Rome.

513
01:00:18,270 --> 01:00:19,450
Don't even think it.

514
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:21,880
There's always been a senate.

515
01:00:21,980 --> 01:00:23,610
Rome has changed.

516
01:00:23,710 --> 01:00:26,040
It takes an emperor
to rule an empire.

517
01:00:26,140 --> 01:00:28,760
Of course,
but leave the people their...

518
01:00:28,860 --> 01:00:30,270
Illusions?

519
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:33,790
Traditions.

520
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:37,020
My father's war
against the barbarians...

521
01:00:37,150 --> 01:00:40,510
He said it himself: it achieved nothing.
But the people loved him.

522
01:00:40,570 --> 01:00:42,680
The people always love victories.

523
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:44,410
Why?

524
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:46,810
They didn't see the battles.

525
01:00:46,910 --> 01:00:48,700
What do they care about Germania?

526
01:00:49,370 --> 01:00:51,160
They care about
the greatness of Rome.

527
01:00:51,290 --> 01:00:53,340
The greatness of Rome.

528
01:00:55,420 --> 01:00:56,760
Well, what is that?

529
01:00:59,580 --> 01:01:01,310
It's an idea...

530
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:03,230
greatness.

531
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:07,870
Greatness is a vision.

532
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:10,330
Exactly. A vision.

533
01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:13,500
Do you not see, Lucilla?

534
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:19,290
I will give the people a vision of Rome,
and they will love me for it.

535
01:01:19,390 --> 01:01:24,060
And they'll soon forget the tedious
sermonizing of a few dry old men.

536
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:38,200
I will give the people
the greatest vision of their lives.

537
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:29,660
White and red wine
for your drinking pleasure!

538
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:39,100
Games.

539
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:43,900
One hundred and fifty days
of games.

540
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:45,850
He's cleverer than I thought.

541
01:02:45,980 --> 01:02:47,160
Clever.

542
01:02:47,260 --> 01:02:50,360
The whole of Rome
would be laughing at him...

543
01:02:50,460 --> 01:02:52,640
if they weren't so afraid
of his praetorian.

544
01:02:52,730 --> 01:02:54,680
Fear and wonder...
a powerful combination.

545
01:02:56,060 --> 01:02:58,840
You really think the people
are going to be seduced by that?

546
01:02:58,940 --> 01:03:01,210
I think he knows what Rome is.

547
01:03:01,340 --> 01:03:02,910
Rome is the mob.

548
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:06,460
Conjure magic for them,
and they'll be distracted.

549
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:10,140
Take away their freedom,
and still they'll roar.

550
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:12,570
The beating heart of Rome...

551
01:03:12,700 --> 01:03:14,490
is not the marble of the senate.

552
01:03:14,620 --> 01:03:16,890
It's the sand of the Colosseum.

553
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:20,350
He'll bring them death...

554
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:24,760
and they will love him for it.

555
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:47,290
Spaniard.

556
01:04:58,110 --> 01:04:59,450
Are you not entertained?

557
01:05:00,220 --> 01:05:01,690
Are you not entertained?

558
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:06,430
Is this not why you are here?

559
01:05:10,910 --> 01:05:12,280
Spaniard! Spaniard!

560
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:32,190
What do you want?

561
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:35,710
Girl?

562
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:38,270
Boy?

563
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:39,740
You sent for me.

564
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:41,690
Yes, I did.

565
01:05:41,790 --> 01:05:44,380
You're good, Spaniard,
but you're not that good.

566
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:45,980
You could be magnificent.

567
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:48,350
I'm required to kill, so I kill.

568
01:05:48,410 --> 01:05:49,880
That is enough.

569
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:52,920
That's enough for the provinces,
but not for Rome.

570
01:05:56,380 --> 01:05:57,720
The young emperor...

571
01:05:57,820 --> 01:06:00,030
has arranged
a series of spectacles...

572
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:02,270
to commemorate his father...

573
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:04,640
Marcus Aurelius.

574
01:06:04,730 --> 01:06:06,780
I find that amusing...

575
01:06:06,910 --> 01:06:08,760
since it was Marcus Aurelius...

576
01:06:08,890 --> 01:06:11,480
the wise,
the all-knowing Marcus Aurelius...

577
01:06:11,580 --> 01:06:13,470
that closed us down.

578
01:06:16,190 --> 01:06:20,120
So, finally, after five years
of scratching a living...

579
01:06:20,220 --> 01:06:22,590
in flea-infested villages...

580
01:06:22,650 --> 01:06:25,850
we're finally going back
to where we belong...

581
01:06:25,980 --> 01:06:27,770
the Colosseum.

582
01:06:29,850 --> 01:06:32,440
Oh, you should see
the Colosseum, Spaniard.

583
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:35,550
Fifty thousand Romans...

584
01:06:36,570 --> 01:06:40,350
watching every movement
of your sword...

585
01:06:41,630 --> 01:06:43,900
willing you to make
that killer blow.

586
01:06:45,150 --> 01:06:47,480
The silence before you strike...

587
01:06:47,580 --> 01:06:49,470
and the noise afterwards.

588
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:51,130
It rises.

589
01:06:51,230 --> 01:06:53,020
It rises up like...

590
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:56,410
like a storm...

591
01:06:56,540 --> 01:06:58,490
as if you were
the thunder god himself.

592
01:06:58,590 --> 01:07:00,380
You were a gladiator?

593
01:07:00,510 --> 01:07:02,010
Yes, I was.

594
01:07:08,060 --> 01:07:10,170
You won your freedom?

595
01:07:10,270 --> 01:07:12,540
A long time ago, the emperor...

596
01:07:14,140 --> 01:07:16,090
presented me with a rudis.

597
01:07:16,190 --> 01:07:18,970
It's just a wooden sword.

598
01:07:20,540 --> 01:07:22,970
The symbol of your freedom.

599
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:27,800
He touched me on the shoulder,
and I was free.

600
01:07:28,990 --> 01:07:30,940
You knew Marcus Aurelius?

601
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:34,650
I did not say I knew him. I said
he touched me on the shoulder once.

602
01:07:36,060 --> 01:07:38,270
You asked me what I want.

603
01:07:39,420 --> 01:07:42,270
I too, want to stand
in front of the emperor...

604
01:07:43,390 --> 01:07:44,730
as you did.

605
01:07:44,830 --> 01:07:47,000
Then listen to me.

606
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:48,670
Learn from me.

607
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:52,890
I wasn't the best
because I killed quickly.

608
01:07:53,020 --> 01:07:56,380
I was the best
because the crowd loved me.

609
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:58,270
Win the crowd...

610
01:07:58,360 --> 01:08:00,190
and you'll win your freedom.

611
01:08:03,900 --> 01:08:05,690
I will win the crowd.

612
01:08:08,030 --> 01:08:11,070
I will give them something
they've never seen before.

613
01:08:12,220 --> 01:08:15,640
So, Spaniard,
we shall go to Rome together...

614
01:08:15,740 --> 01:08:17,530
and have bloody adventures...

615
01:08:17,660 --> 01:08:19,450
and the great whore
will suckle us...

616
01:08:19,580 --> 01:08:21,950
until we are fat and happy
and can suckle no more.

617
01:08:22,010 --> 01:08:23,420
And then...

618
01:08:24,570 --> 01:08:26,460
when enough men have died...

619
01:08:28,220 --> 01:08:30,010
perhaps you will have your freedom.

620
01:08:35,070 --> 01:08:38,010
Here. Use this.

621
01:09:00,090 --> 01:09:02,200
It's somewhere out there...

622
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:04,190
my country...

623
01:09:04,250 --> 01:09:05,980
my home.

624
01:09:06,780 --> 01:09:09,560
My wife is preparing food.

625
01:09:09,660 --> 01:09:12,920
My daughters carry water
from the river.

626
01:09:13,050 --> 01:09:15,420
Will I ever see them again?

627
01:09:16,440 --> 01:09:18,330
I think no.

628
01:09:18,430 --> 01:09:20,220
Do you believe you'll see them again
when you die?

629
01:09:20,350 --> 01:09:22,460
I think so.

630
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:24,410
But then...

631
01:09:24,540 --> 01:09:26,110
I will die soon.

632
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:30,300
They will not die for many years.

633
01:09:30,360 --> 01:09:32,030
I'll have to wait.

634
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:34,430
But you would wait?

635
01:09:34,490 --> 01:09:36,220
Of course.

636
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:39,260
You see...

637
01:09:40,410 --> 01:09:41,820
my wife...

638
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:45,050
and my son...

639
01:09:45,180 --> 01:09:46,970
are already waiting for me.

640
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:49,470
You'll meet them again.

641
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:51,740
But not yet.

642
01:09:55,390 --> 01:09:58,430
Not yet, unless...

643
01:09:58,490 --> 01:09:59,900
Not yet.

644
01:10:03,290 --> 01:10:04,700
Not yet.

645
01:10:16,540 --> 01:10:18,430
There.
There it is.

646
01:11:05,340 --> 01:11:06,750
Out.

647
01:11:07,900 --> 01:11:09,690
Go! Go! Out!

648
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:23,710
Good to see you again,
old friend.

649
01:11:29,150 --> 01:11:30,650
Bring me fortune.

650
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:38,300
Have you ever seen anything
like that before?

651
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:41,980
I didn't know men
could build such things.

652
01:11:51,100 --> 01:11:52,890
Win the crowd.

653
01:11:53,020 --> 01:11:55,130
Get inside! Move!

654
01:11:55,260 --> 01:11:56,600
Inside!

655
01:12:43,580 --> 01:12:46,360
He sleeps so well
because he's loved.

656
01:12:49,150 --> 01:12:51,930
Come, brother. It's late.

657
01:12:54,170 --> 01:12:57,440
I will make Rome
the wonder of the ages.

658
01:12:59,740 --> 01:13:02,680
That is what Gracchus and his friends
don't understand.

659
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:06,780
All my desires
are splitting my head to pieces.

660
01:13:14,620 --> 01:13:16,090
Drink this tonic.

661
01:13:25,370 --> 01:13:28,350
I think the time is almost right.

662
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:30,490
I could announce
the dissolution of the senate...

663
01:13:30,590 --> 01:13:32,380
at the celebration
to honor our father.

664
01:13:32,510 --> 01:13:34,300
Do you think I should?

665
01:13:35,550 --> 01:13:37,340
Are the people ready?

666
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,890
I think you need your rest now.

667
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,830
Will you stay with me?

668
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:50,810
Still afraid of the dark,
brother?

669
01:13:57,880 --> 01:13:59,290
Still.

670
01:14:00,860 --> 01:14:02,200
Always.

671
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:06,490
- Stay with me tonight.
- You know I won't.

672
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:12,120
Then kiss me.

673
01:14:20,700 --> 01:14:22,040
Sleep, brother.

674
01:14:40,250 --> 01:14:41,660
Come on!

675
01:14:43,770 --> 01:14:45,180
Take me.

676
01:14:49,790 --> 01:14:52,060
All right, that's enough.

677
01:14:53,060 --> 01:15:03,060
