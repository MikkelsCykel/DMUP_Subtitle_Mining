<b>In Dreams (1999)</b>

3
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,824
(Man shouts )

4
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:57,665
(Woman ) Mirror, mirror, on the wall,

5
00:03:57,738 --> 00:04:00,332
who's the fairest of us all?

6
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:05,572
(Girl) You're the fairest in
this hall, but Snow White is the...

7
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:08,136
(Chuckles ) Come on, Rebecca.
Forget it's a play.

8
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:10,581
Just say it
like you're saying it to me.

9
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,845
Snow White's the fairest of them all.

10
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:16,377
And again. Mirror, mirror, on the
wall, who's the fairest of us all?

11
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:18,754
- You're the fairest in...
- Wrong.

12
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:20,224
You are.

13
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:25,096
What are they doing, Mommy?

14
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:29,624
Nothing, Rebecca.
Daddy'll be home soon.

15
00:04:29,703 --> 00:04:30,897
Last to the car's a bag of rats!

16
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:32,802
(Dog barks )

17
00:04:32,906 --> 00:04:36,000
(Rebecca ) You never knew
I was a bag of rats!

18
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:02,567
(Rebecca ) Daddy!

19
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:04,431
Daddy!

20
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:09,432
Hey. Hey, sweetie.

21
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:12,205
- (Rebecca ) The goldfish died.
- Oh, no.

22
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,974
- He did?
- He started to swim backwards.

23
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:18,449
Mom froze him so we could
bury him when you come back.

24
00:05:18,552 --> 00:05:21,919
- You want something to eat?
- Breakfast and lunch.

25
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:26,516
- Mary's made spaghetti.
- Oh, God. It's 2am for me, honey.

26
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:28,891
I'm sorry. What are these?

27
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,860
- Nothing.
- That's Snow White.

28
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:33,161
Show Daddy your costume, honey.

29
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:36,600
No, I don't want to.
I wanna show him the goldfish.

30
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:38,499
OK.

31
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:42,407
What is this?
Little Red Riding Hood?

32
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:45,569
No. It's nothing
to do with anything.

33
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,840
It's just another weird dream.

34
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:51,577
Oh, no. Not like the one you had
before my mother died, is it?

35
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:53,583
- No.
- Good.

36
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:56,952
Not like that one.
This one, it keeps coming back.

37
00:05:57,057 --> 00:06:01,187
There's an orchard
and this little girl.

38
00:06:01,328 --> 00:06:04,923
That little girl,
she's being led through it.

39
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:09,468
- The little girl that's missing?
- She's holding someone's hand.

40
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:13,905
It's a man or a woman...
with red hair.

41
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:17,466
I keep trying to get rid of it.
I can't.

42
00:06:17,611 --> 00:06:20,045
I don't know.
What do you want me to say?

43
00:06:20,147 --> 00:06:22,877
- If it's real, go to the cops.
- Paul, please.

44
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:26,350
- I don't know about psychic stuff.
- I hate that word.

45
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:28,683
- So do I.
- What's "physic", Daddy?

46
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:33,624
They're searching the reservoir,
but I have a feeling she's not dead.

47
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:35,820
What's "physic", Daddy?

48
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:39,261
Psychic is when you can
see through things, like...

49
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:42,392
what's in that big box
that Daddy brought home?

50
00:06:42,536 --> 00:06:44,470
Right by the front door.

51
00:06:44,538 --> 00:06:46,403
- You got it?
- You bet ya.

52
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:49,134
I tramped all over Tokyo for that.

53
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:52,406
(Motor whining)

54
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,845
(Paul) Not too low!

55
00:06:57,317 --> 00:06:59,785
And again. (Chuckles )

56
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:11,557
(Whispers ) Good night, sweetheart.

57
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:14,532
Wasn't that meant for her birthday?

58
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:18,934
Yeah, it was. But I can't be here.
I'm only on a stopover.

59
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:21,405
- Have you told her?
- No.

60
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:23,738
They fucked up my schedule again.

61
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,574
- What about the play?
- The play's fine.

62
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:29,308
I have to leave for Seattle at eight.

63
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:38,581
Hey. I got you a kimono.

64
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:41,827
(Dog growls)

65
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:52,331
(Dog barks )

66
00:07:57,077 --> 00:07:58,942
Hey.

67
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:33,975
(Girl)
What did you say your name was?

68
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,980
(Deep voice ) Red.

69
00:08:42,656 --> 00:08:44,681
(Sighs )

70
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:51,092
(Girl) Where are we going?

71
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,427
(Gasps )

72
00:08:58,004 --> 00:09:00,063
(Sobs )

73
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,199
What?

74
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:04,534
What is it?

75
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:10,310
I saw her,
the little girl that's missing.

76
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:13,875
- I can't help it. I'm sorry.
- Oh, Jesus.

77
00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:16,012
I'm sorry.

78
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:24,991
She's so innocent, Paul,
going wherever he asks her.

79
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:28,227
It's somewhere terrible.

80
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:31,737
I told you, if it's real
you should go to the cops.

81
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:38,006
It's worse now. It's like
some storm's about to break.

82
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:42,447
All right, look, honey.
Tomorrow I'll go to the police, OK?

83
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:46,040
I'll tell them whatever it is
you're imagining, all right?

84
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:49,588
I wanna know I'm wrong, Paul,
more than anything.

85
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:51,748
I wanna know it's just a dream.

86
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:54,951
(Paul sighs )

87
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:58,930
Oh, you know, I'm sorry to
keep you waiting, Mr Cooper.

88
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:01,865
- I apologise. Really I do.
- No problem.

89
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:05,336
I hope you understand that,
you know, this is, well...

90
00:10:05,405 --> 00:10:08,374
- This has been a very busy week.
- Yeah, yeah.

91
00:10:08,508 --> 00:10:10,806
OK, uh, let me...

92
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:13,344
Let me see if I get this right here.

93
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:15,847
Your wife had a headache...

94
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:19,180
and she saw a vision
of the missing child, right?

95
00:10:19,252 --> 00:10:21,516
I wouldn't phrase it like that.

96
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,920
- How would you phrase it?
- She has, um, these dreams.

97
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:27,050
- Is she a clairvoyant?
- No.

98
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:31,062
Does she talk to dead people?
Communicate with the dead?

99
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:33,725
What? Detective, this isn't a seance.

100
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,633
I was gonna ask
does she wear a turban? (Laughs )

101
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:39,433
One of those crystal balls
with a lamp shade?

102
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:41,473
- None of that.
- Just checking.

103
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:43,509
Tell me what happened.

104
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:46,670
She dreamt the child
was taken to an orchard

105
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:50,079
where terrible things were
happenin' to her. North of here.

106
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:52,083
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

107
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:55,643
In this vision,
did she get a fix on anyone else?

108
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:58,485
Only his hand.
He was holding her hand.

109
00:10:58,558 --> 00:11:00,389
The little girl?

110
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,893
Yeah, but it could've been a woman's.

111
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:08,195
Could have been... Oh. All right.
OK. OK, sir. Thanks for comin' in.

112
00:11:08,301 --> 00:11:13,068
Detective! I'm waitin' here an hour.
My wife isn't makin' this up.

113
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:17,098
I'm not saying she is. It's been
a long day, give me a break.

114
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:21,204
Based on your information,
I'm lookin' for a man, a woman...

115
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:23,146
It's not really helpin' me.

116
00:11:23,216 --> 00:11:26,117
Listen, listen.
I know you got a tough job.

117
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:28,277
I got a tough job too. I fly 7 47 s.

118
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,720
I got 350 people relyin' on me.

119
00:11:30,824 --> 00:11:35,193
So do me a favour. Hear me out.
Don't treat me like I'm a wacko.

120
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:37,752
They already found her, Mr Cooper.

121
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:41,164
Bottom of a storm drain.
Stones in her pockets.

122
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:45,601
So you go back to flyin' your 7 47 s.
You take care of your people.

123
00:11:45,672 --> 00:11:50,439
I gotta get back to the tedious
business of finding who killed her.

124
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,705
Thanks for comin' in.

125
00:11:57,984 --> 00:12:00,111
There are 12 fairies, Mommy.

126
00:12:00,253 --> 00:12:02,949
Oh. But you'll look the best.

127
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:05,557
I'm the only one that talks.

128
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:08,025
OK. Why don't you try it
one more time?

129
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:10,960
Then we'll go to dance class, OK?
Big breath.

130
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,624
Who's the fairest of us all?

131
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,134
You're the fairest in this hall,

132
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:20,103
but Snow White's
the fairest...of them all.

133
00:12:20,173 --> 00:12:21,663
Very good.

134
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:25,368
(Paul) Claire?

135
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:28,680
Hon?

136
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:38,654
There you are.

137
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:42,592
You don't have to tell me.
I heard it on the news.

138
00:12:42,662 --> 00:12:45,130
Guess I'm crazy again, huh?

139
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:49,159
Well, you got it wrong this time.

140
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:52,269
Yeah, I got a lot of things wrong.

141
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:56,204
- What's that mean?
- You know what it means.

142
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:58,437
I don't. What are you talking about?

143
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:02,811
I'm talking about the girl
you're seeing in Sydney, Australia.

144
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:06,818
I'm talking about me pretending
it hasn't been happening.

145
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:08,513
Don't look so surprised.

146
00:13:08,588 --> 00:13:11,887
I'm not reading your mind
or your fucking letters,

147
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:14,755
but be more discreet
where you put them!

148
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:17,125
I took this girl to dinner once.

149
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:20,666
She got a crush on me.
I fucked up. I'm sorry.

150
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:23,235
Nothing happened.
Honey, listen to me.

151
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:26,466
Nothing happened.
I promise you. I fucked up.

152
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:29,804
This is what's been
fucking up the schedule?

153
00:13:29,876 --> 00:13:33,676
No, this is not.
My schedule changes without notice.

154
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:37,910
This isn't about your schedule.
This is about you fucking someone!

155
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:40,612
But I didn't!
I wanted to, but I didn't!

156
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:45,414
Maybe I wouldn't have wanted to

157
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:48,517
if the woman I love
was here once in a while!

158
00:13:48,595 --> 00:13:51,063
I mean, where are you, Claire?

159
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:54,964
If it's not one obsession,
it's another. You're gone!

160
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:57,025
Daddy, if I was real...

161
00:13:57,103 --> 00:13:59,435
- Hmm?
- ..dishing out wishes...

162
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:02,030
- All right.
- What would you wish?

163
00:14:02,108 --> 00:14:04,633
That I didn't need one.

164
00:14:05,812 --> 00:14:07,905
OK, let's go.

165
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:11,016
- My wand cured the rain.
- Oh, thank God for that.

166
00:14:11,117 --> 00:14:14,018
Let's take these off,
they'll get bent in the car.

167
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:17,056
- Are you coming?
- I'm coming in the other car.

168
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:18,784
- Let's go.
- Why?

169
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:21,086
I have to fly tonight, darlin'.

170
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:23,856
When I come back,
I'll stay much longer.

171
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:25,988
If your mother lets me.

172
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,891
Hello, flowers.

173
00:14:30,003 --> 00:14:31,937
Hello, birds.

174
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:33,973
- Hello, Snow White!
- (Screams )

175
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,806
Please don't kill me.
I'm begging you. Please.

176
00:14:37,944 --> 00:14:40,674
What have I done?
Please don't kill me.

177
00:14:40,747 --> 00:14:43,807
(Fairies ) Please show mercy!

178
00:14:44,117 --> 00:14:46,984
Please show mercy!

179
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,881
Please show mercy!

180
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:52,148
- Please show mercy!
- Run!

181
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:56,218
Run away and never come back
or your stepmother will get you!

182
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:58,354
(Applause )

183
00:14:58,765 --> 00:15:01,791
I'll always remember
her beautiful smile.

184
00:15:02,969 --> 00:15:05,028
She was so very kind.

185
00:15:05,138 --> 00:15:08,164
- She made our house a home.
- She was very nice to us.

186
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:10,300
She so loved animals. (Crying)

187
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:12,344
She cleaned my glasses.

188
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,437
- Honey!
- Who is this lovely maiden?

189
00:15:14,514 --> 00:15:16,414
- Oops!
- She's Snow White!

190
00:15:16,516 --> 00:15:18,484
What happened to her?

191
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:21,917
(Dwarves )
She got poisoned by the witch.

192
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:24,512
She's the loveliest maiden
I've ever seen.

193
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,024
May I take her home
to my castle so...

194
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,685
(All) Will we never see her again?

195
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,458
You may come and live
in my castle as well.

196
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:34,624
(Applause )

197
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:37,192
Mirror, mirror,

198
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:39,771
on the wall,

199
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:44,434
who's the fairest one of all?

200
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:48,412
You are the fairest in this hall,

201
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:50,574
but Snow White is the fairest...

202
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:54,450
- of them all.
- (Giggles )

203
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,784
No, no, no!

204
00:15:56,856 --> 00:16:00,417
Snow White's
the fairest of them all!

205
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:03,120
(Screams )

206
00:16:03,196 --> 00:16:05,596
(Giggling and shouting)

207
00:16:07,767 --> 00:16:09,997
Hello. There you are.

208
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:14,130
You were so good. You were so good.
OK, hang on a second.

209
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:17,401
I'll see you in a couple of days, OK?
Bye-bye.

210
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:20,604
Bye. All right, already. I gotta go.

211
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,147
Claire, I was stupid, all right?

212
00:16:25,218 --> 00:16:27,982
I admit that.
Nothing more. I promise.

213
00:16:28,054 --> 00:16:31,990
- OK. Promise?
- It was my fault.

214
00:16:32,058 --> 00:16:34,083
- Bye. Bye.
- See you.

215
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,721
- I love you.
- I gotta go. All right.

216
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,457
I love you.

217
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:50,769
(Girls shouting)

218
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,435
Rebecca?

219
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:57,074
Sweetie? Sorry,
I thought you were my little girl.

220
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:59,118
Honey?

221
00:17:00,153 --> 00:17:02,053
Rebecca?

222
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:04,715
(Shouting)

223
00:17:04,824 --> 00:17:07,292
Rebecca? Rebecca?

224
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:10,755
- Rebecca?
- (Squealing)

225
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,733
Rebecca!

226
00:17:18,571 --> 00:17:20,835
Rebecca? Rebecca?

227
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,539
Rebecca!

228
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:30,013
Rebecca!

229
00:17:30,283 --> 00:17:32,513
Rebecca!

230
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,119
(Girl) Where are we going?

231
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:39,454
(Deep voice ) To my house.

232
00:17:40,293 --> 00:17:42,784
(Claire ) Rebecca!

233
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:47,457
- (Man ) Guys, fan out to the right!
- Rebecca!

234
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:49,592
- Where are you?
- We'll find her.

235
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:51,967
Rebecca!

236
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:55,802
Why didn't I know?
Why didn't I see it? Rebecca!

237
00:17:55,875 --> 00:18:00,471
Rebecca! Rebecca!

238
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:03,242
(Man ) I said, fan out to the right!

239
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:06,546
We're gonna cover
every inch of ground tonight!

240
00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:10,122
(Claire ) Rebecca! Rebecca!

241
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:12,156
Rebecca!

242
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,228
(Wails)

243
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:26,970
Why didn't you tell me? It wasn't
the past, it was the future!

244
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,768
Take it easy, ma'am.

245
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:31,401
She's gone! You know that!

246
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:34,604
- We don't know that.
- Well, I know it!

247
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:44,449
(Screaming) Lord!

248
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:46,582
Lord, let me help her!

249
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,818
Let me help her!

250
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:53,296
(Groans )

251
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:57,196
(Indistinct deep voice )

252
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,639
(Police radio in background)

253
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:13,109
How long have you had these visions?

254
00:19:13,219 --> 00:19:15,244
All my life.

255
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:17,380
All your life?

256
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:19,720
Jeez.

257
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:23,853
Look, you know, I...
I owe you an apology. I'm sorry.

258
00:19:23,963 --> 00:19:28,297
- Your husband came to talk to me.
- Don't apologise, Detective.

259
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:31,268
No. I was more wrong than you were.

260
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:35,071
You see, I need an interpreter.

261
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:38,208
- For what?
- For whatever it is I dream.

262
00:19:41,414 --> 00:19:43,211
Hmm.

263
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:22,211
- (Radio ) 'Detective Kay?'
- Yeah, this is Kay.

264
00:20:22,288 --> 00:20:24,347
'The divers have...'

265
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:26,653
Mrs...Mrs Cooper...?

266
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:30,787
- 'Are you there?'
- Somebody stay with Mrs Cooper!

267
00:20:30,863 --> 00:20:32,922
Yeah?

268
00:20:32,999 --> 00:20:35,467
'We found a body.'

269
00:20:40,506 --> 00:20:42,770
(Kay ) Don't touch any evidence!

270
00:20:42,842 --> 00:20:46,471
Everybody, settle down.
Where's Mrs Cooper? Jeez...

271
00:20:51,684 --> 00:20:53,584
(Tyres screech)

272
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,754
- Claire.
- Paul.

273
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:02,385
- What?
- I can't. I'm sorry.

274
00:21:02,528 --> 00:21:05,224
I'm sorry. I...I...

275
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:07,595
Oh, God.

276
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:10,725
Oh, no! Oh, please, God!

277
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:14,435
- Mr Cooper, stay calm.
- Is it my daughter?

278
00:21:14,507 --> 00:21:16,532
- Is it?
- Stay with Mr Cooper.

279
00:21:19,078 --> 00:21:20,943
(Kay ) Claire!

280
00:21:27,353 --> 00:21:29,253
(Tyres screech)

281
00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:44,092
(Siren )

282
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:52,609
Claire! Please pull over! Please!

283
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:55,875
You'll get us both killed!
Claire! Please!

284
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:01,910
(Tyres screech)

285
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,429
Mommy?

286
00:22:47,433 --> 00:22:50,459
I'm not afraid any longer, Mommy.

287
00:22:57,843 --> 00:23:00,744
(Faint whisper)
My daddy was a dollar.

288
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:27,001
(Whisper) My daddy was a dollar.

289
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:40,212
(Whisper) My daddy was a dollar.

290
00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:46,417
Not worth a hundred cents.

291
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:49,255
My daddy was a dollar.

292
00:23:49,395 --> 00:23:51,955
I wrote it on a fence.

293
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:54,658
My daddy was a dollar.

294
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:56,632
Not worth a hundred cents.

295
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:01,131
(Monitors beeping)

296
00:24:04,977 --> 00:24:07,343
(Man ) Can you look at me?

297
00:24:10,216 --> 00:24:12,582
Can you squeeze my finger?

298
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:18,151
Wiggle your toes, please.

299
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:24,027
Do you remember
ever seeing me before?

300
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:29,460
No.

301
00:24:30,436 --> 00:24:32,301
Well, I'm Dr Stevens.

302
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:34,395
I'm the neurosurgeon.

303
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:37,704
You've been trying to wake up
for about a day now.

304
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:40,745
You had quite a little bump
on your head.

305
00:24:40,846 --> 00:24:45,340
You had a lot of water in your lungs,
but we're doing fine, Mr Cooper.

306
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:50,252
How long have I been here? How long?

307
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:53,189
Well, about six weeks.

308
00:24:55,928 --> 00:24:58,294
Why did you bring me back?

309
00:24:58,397 --> 00:25:02,094
(Stevens ) Hmm. Don't think
it was easy, Claire.

310
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:10,166
(Muffled screaming)

311
00:25:15,381 --> 00:25:18,350
(Boy ) Mommy! Mommy, help!

312
00:25:18,417 --> 00:25:20,009
Help! Help!

313
00:25:29,061 --> 00:25:31,291
Claire? Claire?

314
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:33,126
Shh, shh, shh.

315
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:36,361
You're in the hospital.
You're in a hospital.

316
00:25:36,435 --> 00:25:38,494
- Oh.
- All right?

317
00:25:38,604 --> 00:25:42,665
I'm Dr Stevens. Remember me?
Remember meeting me?

318
00:25:42,775 --> 00:25:46,973
Yeah. Oof.
You had a nightmare, hmm?

319
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:48,979
How did you know?

320
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:52,142
Well, your heart rate
was bouncin' around.

321
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:54,344
Can you read dreams?

322
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:57,250
No. I skipped that class in college.

323
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,448
Must've been a wild one, hmm?

324
00:25:59,525 --> 00:26:03,689
Yeah. There's a little boy in a room
filling up with water.

325
00:26:03,762 --> 00:26:05,593
He's tied to the bed.

326
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:08,199
- Water, huh?
- Water.

327
00:26:08,267 --> 00:26:13,034
I do have a friend who majored in...
what'd you call it, reading dreams?

328
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:15,504
- Wanna talk to him?
- Well, what is he?

329
00:26:15,607 --> 00:26:18,872
A psychiatrist.
But don't hold that against him.

330
00:26:18,944 --> 00:26:22,277
- Well, can he stop them?
- He might.

331
00:26:22,348 --> 00:26:26,341
I'll get a nurse to prescribe
something for you. All right?

332
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:28,443
- OK.
- OK.

333
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:37,088
(Indistinct muttering)

334
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,128
(Deep voice ) # Anyone else but me

335
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:50,939
# Anyone else but me

336
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:56,970
# Don't sit under the apple tree

337
00:26:57,082 --> 00:27:01,075
# With anyone else but me

338
00:27:01,186 --> 00:27:05,179
(Paul) # Anyone else but me #

339
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,349
Why are you singing that?

340
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,757
Because you were singing that...

341
00:27:09,828 --> 00:27:11,796
(Chuckles ) In your sleep.

342
00:27:11,864 --> 00:27:14,128
How long have they been here?

343
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:16,394
They just got here.

344
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:19,130
This is Dr Silverman.
The psychiatrist.

345
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:21,399
Can you stop the dreams?

346
00:27:22,341 --> 00:27:26,243
Well, we can start
by talking about them.

347
00:27:27,346 --> 00:27:29,473
Has he killed another child?

348
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:33,017
You're here to get well,
not drive yourself crazy.

349
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:35,245
How many has he killed, Paul?

350
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,983
- How many?
- There's a girl missing upstate...

351
00:27:39,057 --> 00:27:41,355
but they're not sure
it's the same guy.

352
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:44,018
It is, and it's the same place.

353
00:27:44,096 --> 00:27:47,361
- Someone was singing.
- You were singing.

354
00:27:47,433 --> 00:27:52,200
No. Someone was singing through me.
That doesn't make sense.

355
00:27:52,304 --> 00:27:55,831
Tell me about your dreams, Claire.

356
00:27:55,908 --> 00:27:59,435
One's a little boy
in a drowning room, and uh...

357
00:27:59,545 --> 00:28:04,448
And some of the others
are in this big room.

358
00:28:04,583 --> 00:28:07,313
It's like a...orchard.

359
00:28:07,386 --> 00:28:09,616
It's filled with apples.

360
00:28:10,756 --> 00:28:13,156
I know there'll be more.

361
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:17,594
Could you leave us
together for a while?

362
00:28:19,631 --> 00:28:23,158
- Will you make them go away?
- I'd like to try.

363
00:28:23,235 --> 00:28:25,829
Mr Cooper, how is your marriage?

364
00:28:26,972 --> 00:28:29,463
My marriage? It's fine.

365
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,873
I mean, as well as can be expected.

366
00:28:31,944 --> 00:28:34,208
But you've asked to take her home.

367
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:38,113
Yes. She's my wife.
I'd like to care for her at home.

368
00:28:38,183 --> 00:28:41,778
I want to know
that your home environment is stable.

369
00:28:41,854 --> 00:28:44,516
It is. Our marriage is fine.

370
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:48,558
In that case, I agree.
Home might be the best place for her.

371
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,924
I'd like to be the judge of that.

372
00:28:50,996 --> 00:28:56,059
We've got to realise that she's in
a state of suspended bereavement.

373
00:28:56,134 --> 00:28:58,625
She's never had a chance to mourn.

374
00:29:01,974 --> 00:29:04,408
(Paul) Mary's come for the week.

375
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:06,706
Mary?

376
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:10,043
Yeah. Mary.

377
00:29:10,616 --> 00:29:12,550
The housekeeper?

378
00:29:13,652 --> 00:29:16,086
Your past life, Claire.

379
00:29:28,967 --> 00:29:32,198
How are we gonna deal with it, Paul?

380
00:29:32,304 --> 00:29:34,932
Well, just day by day.

381
00:29:35,007 --> 00:29:38,033
I feel like it all happened
to someone else.

382
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:44,147
I wish to God it had.

383
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:47,582
Like I'm some ghost,
looking down on myself.

384
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:54,314
What about her room?

385
00:29:55,427 --> 00:29:57,486
I haven't been in there.

386
00:29:58,597 --> 00:30:00,724
I'm gonna get the bags.

387
00:30:28,594 --> 00:30:30,494
Claire?

388
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:56,385
Just go to sleep.

389
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:17,271
(Man ) I know you've been dreaming
about me, Claire.

390
00:31:20,646 --> 00:31:23,547
And I've been dreaming of you.

391
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:32,319
Oh! Ohh!

392
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:36,393
Jesus! Fucking...

393
00:31:38,163 --> 00:31:40,757
It wasn't me, Paul.
It was a nightmare.

394
00:31:40,866 --> 00:31:42,766
Don't give me "nightmare!"

395
00:31:42,868 --> 00:31:45,462
You were wide awake and kissing me!

396
00:31:45,537 --> 00:31:48,131
Aren't you taking medicine for them?

397
00:31:48,206 --> 00:31:51,107
- It doesn't work.
- Look...

398
00:31:51,176 --> 00:31:55,078
I will do just about anything
to get us through this, honey,

399
00:31:55,147 --> 00:31:58,810
but you better tell me
what is going on in your head.

400
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:01,681
Paul, please, I can't talk about it.

401
00:32:02,788 --> 00:32:07,122
You just bit through my fucking lip,
and you can't talk about it?

402
00:32:07,192 --> 00:32:11,094
- You're gonna talk to someone else!
- No! No.

403
00:32:11,163 --> 00:32:13,131
Then you talk to me. Tell me!

404
00:32:13,198 --> 00:32:15,393
He killed Rebecca. And he knows.

405
00:32:15,534 --> 00:32:19,061
- He knows what?
- He knows I'm dreaming about him!

406
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:22,370
Oh, Claire.

407
00:32:22,474 --> 00:32:25,739
- That is really crazy.
- I know.

408
00:32:25,877 --> 00:32:28,345
He's in my head. Who are you calling?

409
00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:30,244
Your doctors!

410
00:32:30,315 --> 00:32:34,183
- They can't help me.
- Somebody has to. I can't!

411
00:32:34,252 --> 00:32:36,311
I've used up all my leave.

412
00:32:36,388 --> 00:32:39,448
- I gotta go to work.
- I've got to deal with it.

413
00:32:39,558 --> 00:32:43,892
- I've got the medication and Mary.
- Mary's not a doctor.

414
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:47,125
I swear, if I can't cope
I'll go back myself.

415
00:32:53,505 --> 00:32:57,407
(Man ) Claire, Claire, Claire, Claire.

416
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:00,377
Huh.

417
00:33:02,748 --> 00:33:05,842
"Adapted and illustrated
by Claire Cooper."

418
00:33:08,353 --> 00:33:10,218
Claire, Claire, Claire.

419
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:14,684
Once upon a time
there was a little Claire.

420
00:33:15,761 --> 00:33:18,286
And a very little Claire she was.

421
00:33:18,363 --> 00:33:20,627
(Radio in background)

422
00:33:32,711 --> 00:33:36,010
- I'll call you from Seattle. OK?
- OK.

423
00:33:36,081 --> 00:33:38,948
- You OK?
- Fine. I might even try some work.

424
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:42,953
You have my numbers.
Call the hospital if anything, right?

425
00:33:43,088 --> 00:33:45,386
- OK. OK.
- OK.

426
00:33:45,457 --> 00:33:47,516
Don't worry. (Laughs )

427
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,650
(Sighs )

428
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:25,061
Shit.

429
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,956
Oh!

430
00:34:40,045 --> 00:34:42,912
- You OK?
- Is that the mantra for the day?

431
00:34:43,014 --> 00:34:45,881
I need a cigarette.
I'm going to the store.

432
00:34:45,951 --> 00:34:48,920
Paul said you're not
to leave the house. I'll go.

433
00:34:48,987 --> 00:34:50,454
OK. Thanks.

434
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,755

- (Dog barks )
- Dobie!

442
00:35:47,178 --> 00:35:49,078
Dobie!

443
00:35:51,383 --> 00:35:55,080
Dobie? Dobie!

444
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,846
Dobie!

445
00:36:00,091 --> 00:36:02,025
- (Barking)
- Dobie!

446
00:36:03,428 --> 00:36:05,453
Dobie!

447
00:36:06,731 --> 00:36:08,358
Claire!

448
00:36:08,433 --> 00:36:11,527
Remember me?
We met at the reservoir when you...

449
00:36:11,603 --> 00:36:14,936
- My dog, Dobie. Have you seen...?
- Hm?

450
00:36:15,073 --> 00:36:18,201
- Have you...?
- No, I've seen nothing, ma'am.

451
00:36:18,276 --> 00:36:22,042
Look, your husband, uh...
asked us to, uh,

452
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:25,775
check things out,
keep an eye on things, you know?

453
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,751
- Thank you.
- Dogs like to ramble.

454
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:32,254
- Yeah. I shouldn't worry.
- I didn't say that.

455
00:36:33,658 --> 00:36:37,719
- You OK, Claire?
- I'm fine. Thank you, Detective.

456
00:36:38,096 --> 00:36:41,361
If you see Dobie...the dog.

457
00:36:41,433 --> 00:36:44,800
- Dobie's our dog.
- Look, just so you know...

458
00:36:44,903 --> 00:36:49,397
we checked every orchard
within a radius of 300 miles.

459
00:36:49,507 --> 00:36:51,475
- You found nothing?
- No.

460
00:36:51,576 --> 00:36:55,979
That's the thing, my dreams
are no good till after it happens.

461
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:58,914
- Makes me seem crazy, doesn't it?
- Oh, no.

462
00:36:59,017 --> 00:37:03,977
After what you've been through,
you'd be forgiven a little psychosis.

463
00:37:05,123 --> 00:37:08,217
Kay. Jack Kay.
Call me if you need anything.

464
00:37:08,293 --> 00:37:11,387
Anything at all,
just give me a call, OK?

465
00:37:11,496 --> 00:37:13,896
- Thanks.
- Want me to walk you home?

466
00:37:13,965 --> 00:37:15,364
I'm OK, thank you.

467
00:37:23,775 --> 00:37:26,039
- (Beeping)
- Shit!

468
00:37:33,284 --> 00:37:35,149
Damn it. Mary!

469
00:37:57,175 --> 00:37:59,439

you sick fuck?

'My daddy is a dollar,
I wrote it on a fence.

478
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,161
'My daddy is a dollar, not worth...'

479
00:39:31,236 --> 00:39:34,330
- Get out of my brain.
- (Echoing) 'Get out of my brain.'

480
00:39:34,405 --> 00:39:36,032
(Phone )

481
00:39:38,676 --> 00:39:42,134
- (Man's voice, babbling)
- Leave me alone!

482
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:45,148
Paul? He's in the computer now.

483
00:39:51,856 --> 00:39:54,689
(Voice continues, hysterically)

484
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:08,971
Claire?

485
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,275
Claire?

486
00:40:26,157 --> 00:40:28,091
Claire?

487
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,834
Claire?

488
00:40:41,306 --> 00:40:43,171
Claire?

489
00:40:51,049 --> 00:40:54,507
Oh, Paul... Help me.

490
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:25,647
I wrote...

491
00:41:27,852 --> 00:41:29,843
it...

492
00:41:29,988 --> 00:41:31,888
on...

493
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:33,924
a...

494
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:37,450
(Silverman ) Did you
write this, Claire?

495
00:41:37,528 --> 00:41:40,793
Uh, yeah. I wrote that.

496
00:41:40,865 --> 00:41:45,427
But somebody else
made me do it. (Laughs )

497
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:48,028
And who cut your wrists?

498
00:41:48,139 --> 00:41:50,403
(Chuckling)

499
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:54,773
I did. (Laughs )

500
00:41:54,846 --> 00:41:58,111
But did that someone else
make you do it?

501
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:00,514
No. That was all my own work.

502
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:05,413
- Why, Claire?
- I wanted it to stop.

503
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:08,982
- What did you want to stop?
- The laughter. The...

504
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:11,119
- The thing.
- The dreams?

505
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:15,029
Can you dream in the daytime
when you're wide awake?

506
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:19,627
I'm sorry. I'm not that strong.
I couldn't take it any more.

507
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:26,741
- What does this verse mean?
- I don't know.

508
00:42:26,811 --> 00:42:31,373
- Is it from your childhood?
- No, it's not from my childhood.

509
00:42:31,449 --> 00:42:33,041
(Laughs )

510
00:42:33,117 --> 00:42:36,177
- It's from someone else's childhood.
- Whose?

511
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:41,481
It's, uh...

512
00:42:44,262 --> 00:42:49,359
It's written on the walls
of a boy's room, and, uh,

513
00:42:49,467 --> 00:42:54,632
the boy is chained to the bed,
and the room's filling up with water.

514
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:03,474
- So it's from a dream?
- Yeah.

515
00:43:03,548 --> 00:43:06,779
And is it connected to
your dream of apples?

516
00:43:06,851 --> 00:43:09,251
Yes. It's the same boy.

517
00:43:10,355 --> 00:43:12,915
But in the orchard dream
it was a man.

518
00:43:13,024 --> 00:43:16,482
- Can't you make sense of it?
- Would you like me to?

519
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:20,553
Oh, I would love you to!
I-I-I can't make sense of it.

520
00:43:20,665 --> 00:43:22,530
But, um...

521
00:43:22,633 --> 00:43:25,101
I have a feeling that...

522
00:43:25,169 --> 00:43:28,036
they're all coming
from the same place.

523
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:29,767
From you?

524
00:43:29,841 --> 00:43:33,368
- No, no! From him.
- And who is he?

525
00:43:33,478 --> 00:43:35,469
I don't know.

526
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:37,571
But I think he deserves a name.

527
00:43:39,917 --> 00:43:42,579
We'll call him Red.

528
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,585
It's appropriate.

529
00:43:48,192 --> 00:43:50,126
OK, Claire.

530
00:43:50,228 --> 00:43:52,423
Let's leave it there for the moment.

531
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:55,055
OK. (Sighs )

532
00:43:58,536 --> 00:44:03,030
We're gonna take you to get an ECG
and check your blood pressure.

533
00:44:03,107 --> 00:44:07,476
- Are you gonna keep me here?
- We'll supplement your medication.

534
00:44:07,545 --> 00:44:09,570
Mr Cooper, please come in.

535
00:44:10,815 --> 00:44:12,715
Oh.

536
00:44:14,419 --> 00:44:16,284
Take a seat.

537
00:44:17,955 --> 00:44:20,253
(Mary ) Where are you, boy?

538
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:22,383
Here, boy!

539
00:44:25,296 --> 00:44:27,696
Dobie!

540
00:44:27,765 --> 00:44:30,063
- Dobie!
- What?

541
00:44:30,134 --> 00:44:32,898
He's been missing all day.

542
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:34,870
Oh, great.

543
00:44:34,939 --> 00:44:36,998
How is she?

544
00:44:37,442 --> 00:44:40,309
They want me
to sign her into Stapleton.

545
00:44:40,378 --> 00:44:44,041
I'm sorry.
I feel like it's all my fault.

546
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:48,218
It's not your fault, Mary.

547
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:53,220
Dobie!

548
00:44:53,591 --> 00:44:55,422
Dobie!

549
00:44:57,195 --> 00:45:01,097
- (Growling)
- (Man ) Come on. Come on.

550
00:45:01,165 --> 00:45:03,963
Good boy. Good boy.

551
00:45:04,101 --> 00:45:07,502
- (Whimpering)
- Good boy.

552
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:26,955
(Barking and whimpering)

553
00:45:42,773 --> 00:45:44,866
Dobie?

554
00:45:48,479 --> 00:45:50,947
Dobie, what is it, boy?

555
00:45:51,549 --> 00:45:54,643
- Dobie? What, boy?
- (Barks )

556
00:45:58,823 --> 00:46:00,688
Dobie!

557
00:46:03,661 --> 00:46:07,961
Dobie? Dobie?

558
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:11,159
Dobie? Dobie?

559
00:46:11,269 --> 00:46:13,999
(Whimpering and barking)

560
00:46:14,071 --> 00:46:16,835
Dobie! Dobie!

561
00:46:20,177 --> 00:46:22,236
(Horn )

562
00:46:25,516 --> 00:46:28,246
- (Horns honking)
- Dobie!

563
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:32,555
Dobie!

564
00:47:18,636 --> 00:47:21,070
So what's it gonna be, Paul?

565
00:47:26,877 --> 00:47:28,777
Stapleton?

566
00:47:58,609 --> 00:48:00,474
(Children laugh)

567
00:48:42,553 --> 00:48:44,646
(Growling)

568
00:48:54,298 --> 00:48:56,129
(Growling continues )

569
00:49:24,295 --> 00:49:26,422
She just woke up.

570
00:49:37,141 --> 00:49:40,008
Stand away from the door, please.

571
00:49:40,678 --> 00:49:43,738
I don't know who you are
or where I am,

572
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:46,476
but I'm being held against my will,

573
00:49:46,584 --> 00:49:48,711
and I want to use the telephone.

574
00:49:48,786 --> 00:49:50,777
I'd like you to sit on the bed.

575
00:49:50,855 --> 00:49:54,882
I've found my husband's dead body,
and I want the phone!

576
00:49:54,959 --> 00:49:57,553
After you've seen Dr Silverman.

577
00:49:57,695 --> 00:50:00,789
- What is this place?
- Stapleton Hospital.

578
00:50:00,865 --> 00:50:03,265
This is Rosco, and I'm Nurse Floyd.

579
00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:06,861
Well, fuck both of you.
I want Silverman in here now!

580
00:50:06,937 --> 00:50:10,031
- And I want a phone!
- You're not listening.

581
00:50:10,174 --> 00:50:12,540
I just explained about the phone.

582
00:50:12,643 --> 00:50:14,543
Why don't you understand?

583
00:50:14,612 --> 00:50:17,274
I was just in the Carlton Hotel,

584
00:50:17,381 --> 00:50:20,839
and in room 401 is the body
of my murdered husband.

585
00:50:20,918 --> 00:50:22,943
Want me to put her on the bed?

586
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:26,251
- I'm just gonna put you...
- No! I'll kill you!

587
00:50:26,323 --> 00:50:30,350
- Can I call someone for you?
- Call the fucking police.

588
00:50:30,427 --> 00:50:34,864
My husband's being eaten by a dog
in a hotel room in Hammond.

589
00:50:37,902 --> 00:50:40,063
(Laughing)

590
00:50:40,171 --> 00:50:42,332
Why are you laughing, Claire?

591
00:50:45,109 --> 00:50:47,270
Cos...

592
00:50:47,378 --> 00:50:49,608
the bastard's in my head.

593
00:50:50,681 --> 00:50:52,945
He's fucked up my brain.

594
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:55,684
And now he's murdered my husband.

595
00:50:58,055 --> 00:50:59,784
Oh.

596
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:02,890
Oh, God!

597
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:06,452
- It's happening again!
- What's happening, Claire?

598
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:09,829
What? What are they doing?

599
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:14,060
NO! NO!

600
00:51:14,138 --> 00:51:16,038
(Claire screams )

601
00:51:19,476 --> 00:51:21,569
(Rosco ) We're here to help.

602
00:51:26,584 --> 00:51:28,643
How is she?

603
00:51:29,253 --> 00:51:31,312
Terrible.

604
00:51:31,388 --> 00:51:33,856
I'm gonna sell this house.

605
00:51:35,626 --> 00:51:39,027
I need to get her a new shrink.

606
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:41,223
Want a second opinion?

607
00:51:41,298 --> 00:51:43,732
Yeah. I want 20 of 'em.

608
00:51:43,801 --> 00:51:47,601
Whatever it takes
to get her out of that place.

609
00:51:47,671 --> 00:51:49,298
(Phone )

610
00:51:55,012 --> 00:51:59,381
There's a lady on the phone.
Says she found Dobie near some hotel.

611
00:52:00,217 --> 00:52:02,242
- Hello?
- 'Mr Cooper?'

612
00:52:11,328 --> 00:52:15,697
(Groggily) Doctor, don't...don't
let Paul go to the hotel.

613
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:17,824
Don't let him go.

614
00:52:18,836 --> 00:52:22,772
- Is this a real hotel?
- It doesn't matter. The Carlton.

615
00:52:22,907 --> 00:52:25,637
It's by the ocean in Hammond.

616
00:52:25,709 --> 00:52:29,873
- When were you there?
- Last night, room 401.

617
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:33,416
So it's not real. You dreamt it.

618
00:52:33,517 --> 00:52:37,044
- Was it day or night?
- Daytime. Please call him.

619
00:52:49,033 --> 00:52:51,934
(Silverman )
Does he meet someone there?

620
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:56,496
- He goes to find Dobie.
- Is Dobie a woman, Claire?

621
00:52:56,674 --> 00:52:58,539
(Groaning)

622
00:53:01,612 --> 00:53:03,637
He's a fucking dog.

623
00:53:17,928 --> 00:53:22,331
What have you given me, Doctor?
Why can't I think straight?

624
00:53:22,399 --> 00:53:26,358
Thorazine. It calms you down.

625
00:53:30,607 --> 00:53:33,701
(Silverman )
'What happens to him there?'

626
00:53:34,311 --> 00:53:36,370
(Claire ) 'He dies.'

627
00:53:36,447 --> 00:53:39,041
(Sobbing) Doctor...

628
00:53:40,184 --> 00:53:44,848
Don't you get it, Doctor?
401. Room 401.

629
00:53:44,955 --> 00:53:47,219
How many times do I have to say it?

630
00:53:47,291 --> 00:53:50,920
(Silverman )
'So you dreamt that Paul died.'

631
00:53:50,995 --> 00:53:54,522
I dreamt it and it happens.

632
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:58,091
It's going to happen.

633
00:53:58,202 --> 00:54:02,366
Can't you get it through
your thick psytiactric skull?

634
00:54:02,439 --> 00:54:06,535
The man I love is dead and I'm left
in this God-awful place alone!

635
00:54:08,979 --> 00:54:10,378
Hello?

636
00:54:10,481 --> 00:54:13,075
(Silverman )
'You mean dead to you, Claire.'

637
00:54:13,150 --> 00:54:16,119
No, no, I mean dead like Rebecca.

638
00:54:16,186 --> 00:54:18,916
How many ways can I fucking say it?

639
00:54:19,790 --> 00:54:21,655
Do...

640
00:54:23,627 --> 00:54:27,427
- What the fuck?
- (Silverman ) 'It's called grief.'

641
00:54:27,498 --> 00:54:30,365
No, no, it's Paul this time.

642
00:54:31,435 --> 00:54:33,960
Please. God, listen to me.

643
00:54:34,071 --> 00:54:36,596
- (Whimpering)
- What's this?

644
00:54:37,708 --> 00:54:38,936
Listen to me!

645
00:54:39,743 --> 00:54:41,802
Hi, Paul!

646
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:43,541
Shit!

647
00:54:43,614 --> 00:54:45,445
(Alarm )

648
00:54:49,353 --> 00:54:52,379
Listen to me! Listen to me!

649
00:54:52,456 --> 00:54:56,483
- Listen to me! Oh! No!
- Come on. Get up.

650
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:58,890
Come on!

651
00:54:59,229 --> 00:55:01,663
(Claire ) Listen!

652
00:55:01,732 --> 00:55:05,600
Listen to me!

653
00:55:05,702 --> 00:55:07,533
Listen!

654
00:55:07,604 --> 00:55:11,904
(Rosco ) OK, we're going
to give you something to relax.

655
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:14,603
All right, get her down.

656
00:55:14,678 --> 00:55:18,808
- Please, let me go!
- Just relax.

657
00:55:18,882 --> 00:55:22,648
- Please, no.
- We're going to give you something.

658
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:34,630
Brought you some hot tea, honey.

659
00:55:34,698 --> 00:55:37,030
It'll still be warm.

660
00:55:37,101 --> 00:55:41,697
- I'm sorry. Do I know you?
- You're sharin' a room with me.

661
00:55:41,772 --> 00:55:45,708
- They want me to keep an eye on you.
- I don't remember.

662
00:55:45,843 --> 00:55:49,279
- You got some people in your head.
- Hmm.

663
00:56:28,418 --> 00:56:30,477
(Bang)

664
00:56:45,302 --> 00:56:49,432
What's the matter, honey?
You don't like the pattern?

665
00:56:57,014 --> 00:56:59,448
(Whispers ) Can you keep a secret?

666
00:56:59,516 --> 00:57:01,711
(Whispers ) Probably.

667
00:57:04,054 --> 00:57:06,113
You won't think I'm crazy?

668
00:57:06,223 --> 00:57:08,555
(Chuckling) Probably! I mean...

669
00:57:08,625 --> 00:57:13,426
That man in my head was in
this hospital when he was a boy.

670
00:57:13,497 --> 00:57:15,124
How do you know?

671
00:57:15,199 --> 00:57:19,863
He stayed in this room.
He wrote that.

672
00:57:19,970 --> 00:57:22,165
His name's Vivian Thompson.

673
00:57:22,239 --> 00:57:24,264
Ooh, la-la! (Chuckles )

674
00:57:29,079 --> 00:57:31,513
Did anyone ever get out of here?

675
00:57:31,582 --> 00:57:34,244
I wouldn't start thinkin' that.

676
00:57:34,318 --> 00:57:39,051
I'm not talking about me.
I'm talking about somebody else.

677
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:41,022
It's not that difficult.

678
00:57:41,091 --> 00:57:44,151
When you've been here
as long as I have

679
00:57:44,261 --> 00:57:47,094
you get to know the language
of the place.

680
00:57:47,831 --> 00:57:49,856
Go to sleep.

681
00:58:07,684 --> 00:58:11,245
(Girl) Hi! What's your name?
(Woman ) Ruby!

682
00:58:11,355 --> 00:58:13,414
Oh, sorry. I gotta go.

683
00:58:14,024 --> 00:58:15,958
Ruby!

684
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:19,462
Come on. I'm runnin' late.

685
00:58:19,563 --> 00:58:22,464
- Mommy's in a hurry.
- You're not my mommy.

686
00:58:22,532 --> 00:58:26,764
(Claire ) 'He's hunting...
looking for another little girl.'

687
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:31,864
Guess what her name is, Doctor.
Ruby.

688
00:58:31,975 --> 00:58:34,102
And what colour is Ruby, Claire?

689
00:58:34,211 --> 00:58:37,305
Ruby's not a colour, Doctor.
Ruby's a girl.

690
00:58:37,381 --> 00:58:42,250
Red. Why are you obsessed
with that colour, Claire?

691
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:45,685
I'm not obsessed,
I'm possessed, Doctor.

692
00:58:45,789 --> 00:58:48,690
He's feeding me dreams bit by bit.

693
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:51,625
Why's that, Claire?

694
00:58:51,762 --> 00:58:56,631
Maybe he's lonely.
Maybe he's lonely, Doctor.

695
00:58:58,135 --> 00:59:00,365
Have you a name for him yet?

696
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:04,429
Yes, I have.
His name is Vivian. Vivian Thompson.

697
00:59:04,574 --> 00:59:08,533
There's a town covered in water.
Someone left him in it.

698
00:59:08,612 --> 00:59:10,705
He was taken to this hospital.

699
00:59:10,781 --> 00:59:14,717
He stayed in my room
and he's feeding me dreams.

700
00:59:14,785 --> 00:59:17,515
Why do you think that is, Doctor?

701
00:59:17,754 --> 00:59:22,748
Because he wants to stop.
He wants me to stop him.

702
00:59:22,926 --> 00:59:25,360
It sounds psychotic to you,
doesn't it?

703
00:59:25,462 --> 00:59:27,726
You used that word, Claire.

704
00:59:27,898 --> 00:59:31,595
But follow it through,
Doctor, psychotic or not.

705
00:59:31,668 --> 00:59:35,035
I've gotta let him possess me...
surrender...

706
00:59:35,172 --> 00:59:37,732
Let him take me to him.

707
00:59:37,808 --> 00:59:43,075
So what does that make me? Psychotic?
Delusional? Obsessional? All three?

708
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:47,742
If you admit that it's delusional,
we might be getting someplace.

709
01:00:08,004 --> 01:00:10,734
So, what's it say
on the wall, Ethel?

710
01:00:10,807 --> 01:00:13,970
It's some kind of nursery rhyme.

711
01:00:14,044 --> 01:00:16,706
So, I'm not insane?

712
01:00:17,814 --> 01:00:20,510
Not many of us are, honey.

713
01:00:22,185 --> 01:00:25,518
- Go to sleep.
- That's a good idea.

714
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:28,056
Sleep's the only way to reach him.

715
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:31,322
He's out there hunting another
little girl, and I've gotta stop him.

716
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:38,225
Whatever happens, though, promise me
one thing - don't wake me up.

717
01:01:27,918 --> 01:01:29,783
(Gasps )

718
01:02:03,954 --> 01:02:06,286
(Screaming)

719
01:02:17,467 --> 01:02:19,765
(Screaming continues )

720
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:39,051
My apologies, Claire.

721
01:05:47,277 --> 01:05:51,111
(Rosco ) That's it, Jodie.
Let the medication do the job.

722
01:05:51,247 --> 01:05:53,943
You just relax and sleep.

723
01:05:54,751 --> 01:05:56,651
You'll be fine.

724
01:06:18,341 --> 01:06:20,241
Oh! Excuse me.

725
01:06:24,948 --> 01:06:26,848
(Crickets chirping)

726
01:06:49,506 --> 01:06:52,441
Hey. You need a lift?

727
01:06:52,575 --> 01:06:54,406
I'm waitin' for Lucy.

728
01:06:54,477 --> 01:06:59,039
- Everything all right?
- No, I...

729
01:06:59,149 --> 01:07:02,118
locked myself out of my car.

730
01:07:02,218 --> 01:07:05,210
Come back to the office.
You can use the phone.

731
01:07:05,321 --> 01:07:10,156
Uh, I have a spare,
uh, set...at a garage.

732
01:07:11,394 --> 01:07:14,625
If you're going out,
you could drop me.

733
01:07:15,365 --> 01:07:18,664
- Which garage?
- The one down the road.

734
01:07:19,702 --> 01:07:22,569
- Got your ID?
- It's locked in the car.

735
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:25,865
All right. Hop in.

736
01:07:31,648 --> 01:07:36,813
So, uh, do you want to get a drink
or something like that?

737
01:07:36,886 --> 01:07:40,049
Yeah, maybe. Whatever you wanna do.

738
01:07:52,402 --> 01:07:54,893
(Siren wailing)

739
01:07:54,971 --> 01:07:59,999
- Could we have some music?
- Music? Sure.

740
01:08:03,513 --> 01:08:06,004
( Quiet music)

741
01:08:06,749 --> 01:08:08,580
You work nights.

742
01:08:08,685 --> 01:08:11,586
- Uh, yeah.
- What's your name?

743
01:08:11,654 --> 01:08:16,057
- Vivienne. What's yours?
- Walter.

744
01:08:18,294 --> 01:08:22,321
That's a nice name, Vivienne.
Hey, how you spell that?

745
01:08:22,432 --> 01:08:25,299
V-I-V-I-E-N-N-E.

746
01:08:29,672 --> 01:08:32,539
Can't keep your eyes off me,
can you?

747
01:08:32,642 --> 01:08:35,736
- Off what, Vivienne?
- My legs.

748
01:08:37,714 --> 01:08:40,342
Pity to leave you so soon,
Vivienne.

749
01:08:40,416 --> 01:08:44,512
Well...I'm in no real hurry.

750
01:08:45,622 --> 01:08:49,388
Well, what do you know? Neither am I.

751
01:08:52,762 --> 01:08:56,698
You've been eating those knees
the whole way.

752
01:08:56,766 --> 01:08:59,360
Shouldn't your eyes have been
on the road?

753
01:08:59,435 --> 01:09:01,300
I suppose they should've.

754
01:09:03,740 --> 01:09:05,833
You can kiss me if you want.

755
01:09:06,910 --> 01:09:09,276
Don't mind if I do.

756
01:09:12,015 --> 01:09:13,448
(Giggling)

757
01:09:15,118 --> 01:09:17,313
- What the fuck?
- (Laughs )

758
01:09:18,488 --> 01:09:20,683
Two things, Walter.

759
01:09:20,790 --> 01:09:24,726
- One, get out of the car slowly.
- Mm-hmm.

760
01:09:24,827 --> 01:09:29,628
And two, get your ass back
to Stapleton and tell Silverman

761
01:09:29,699 --> 01:09:32,167
to check out the Carlton Hotel.

762
01:09:46,416 --> 01:09:48,611
Why are we here?

763
01:09:48,685 --> 01:09:50,983
That's my home.

764
01:09:51,087 --> 01:09:53,783
A lake? You live in a lake?

765
01:09:56,125 --> 01:09:58,184
Did once.

766
01:10:06,803 --> 01:10:08,668
(Splash)

767
01:10:31,127 --> 01:10:34,028
(Whispering)
Where did you go, Vivian?

768
01:10:35,665 --> 01:10:38,259
Please, please don't leave me now.

769
01:10:41,504 --> 01:10:44,598
(Footsteps )

770
01:11:02,859 --> 01:11:05,760
Wanna come over to my house, Claire?

771
01:11:06,462 --> 01:11:08,362
Yeah.

772
01:11:08,498 --> 01:11:11,763
I have to warn you, it's haunted.

773
01:11:11,868 --> 01:11:14,268
Who's it haunted by?

774
01:11:14,337 --> 01:11:16,237
You.

775
01:11:36,426 --> 01:11:39,725
I'll show you how to get there.
You can drive now.

776
01:11:47,770 --> 01:11:52,537
Vivian, is there a girl
in your house called Ruby?

777
01:11:52,642 --> 01:11:55,008
Ruby? Yeah.

778
01:11:57,647 --> 01:12:01,845
- She's dying to meet you.
- Oh, God.

779
01:12:01,918 --> 01:12:04,216
You thought it was a real orchard?

780
01:12:04,287 --> 01:12:08,587
That's the thing about dreams,
They're always right...

781
01:12:08,658 --> 01:12:10,717
and always wrong.

782
01:12:16,732 --> 01:12:20,099
You have to drive inside, OK?
I'll open the door.

783
01:12:48,164 --> 01:12:50,689
You know this place,
don't you, Claire?

784
01:12:56,339 --> 01:12:59,433
- Yes.
- You know the funny thing?

785
01:12:59,509 --> 01:13:02,239
What's the funny thing?

786
01:13:02,345 --> 01:13:07,783
I know you got a gun in the band
of the nurse's dress you're wearing.

787
01:13:07,884 --> 01:13:10,114
- I do?
- You do!

788
01:13:10,186 --> 01:13:14,088
And it's not very nice,
you meetin' Ruby with a gun.

789
01:13:14,157 --> 01:13:17,684
Might get her upset.
Might get me upset...

790
01:13:17,793 --> 01:13:20,626
and bring the apples
down on all of us.

791
01:13:21,864 --> 01:13:25,197
- Where is Ruby?
- Ubi est Ruby?

792
01:13:26,669 --> 01:13:29,467
I'm not tellin'
till you gimme the gun.

793
01:13:40,316 --> 01:13:43,376
You know what happens
when the apples fall?

794
01:13:43,452 --> 01:13:45,044
I don't.

795
01:13:52,195 --> 01:13:57,223
# First the tide

796
01:13:58,334 --> 01:14:00,495
# Rushes in

797
01:14:02,638 --> 01:14:06,904
# Plants a kiss

798
01:14:07,043 --> 01:14:10,171
# On the shore

799
01:14:11,113 --> 01:14:15,049
# Then rolls... #

800
01:14:15,151 --> 01:14:19,781
I'm so, so
sorry, sorry, sorry, Claire.

801
01:14:21,424 --> 01:14:23,790
All I wanted was a family.

802
01:14:23,926 --> 01:14:29,193
I knew there was a dreamer out there
like me, cos I was dreamin' of her.

803
01:14:29,332 --> 01:14:31,630
I wanted her to be my family.

804
01:14:33,336 --> 01:14:36,464
And I took her little girl.

805
01:14:36,572 --> 01:14:40,941
And the little girl cried
and hollered,

806
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:46,179
and I punished her
like any dad would.

807
01:14:48,017 --> 01:14:50,042
- And she was lying...
- (Sobbing)

808
01:14:50,219 --> 01:14:53,154
quiet, beautiful...

809
01:14:54,323 --> 01:14:56,382
but like a doll now.

810
01:14:58,194 --> 01:15:00,788
- That's the part I'm sorry for.
- (Gasping)

811
01:15:00,863 --> 01:15:03,263
But I'm gonna make it up to you.

812
01:15:03,366 --> 01:15:05,391
I'm gonna work...

813
01:15:05,468 --> 01:15:07,527
real hard.

814
01:15:07,770 --> 01:15:09,829
Make it perfect.

815
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:14,599
I'm not gonna get upset anymore
now that I've got you here,

816
01:15:14,677 --> 01:15:17,145
and I got us Ruby for a daughter now.

817
01:15:19,382 --> 01:15:22,840
Claire and Vivian and Ruby.
(Chuckles )

818
01:15:24,086 --> 01:15:28,386
Did you... Did you get upset
with Ruby, Vivian?

819
01:15:28,457 --> 01:15:30,584
- Not yet. Not yet.
- Did you?

820
01:15:30,693 --> 01:15:32,888
Are you gonna get upset with me?

821
01:15:34,463 --> 01:15:38,229
Not if you love me
like Mama loves Dad. Will you?

822
01:15:39,302 --> 01:15:41,736
I'll do that, Vivian.

823
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:46,099
I'll do that.

824
01:15:47,243 --> 01:15:50,144
You wouldn't just pretend?

825
01:15:50,279 --> 01:15:52,304
How could I pretend?

826
01:15:54,350 --> 01:15:57,410
How could I pretend with you, Vivian?

827
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:00,455
You know me inside and out.

828
01:16:00,523 --> 01:16:02,957
Things are gonna be perfect...

829
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:06,119
when I see Ruby.

830
01:16:07,330 --> 01:16:10,697
As perfect as they can be
in this valley of tears.

831
01:16:22,411 --> 01:16:26,347
- Oh, Lordy.
- What the fuck is this?

832
01:16:26,415 --> 01:16:30,249
Her dream, Rosco. Your nightmare.

833
01:16:33,489 --> 01:16:37,220
(Vivian ) Ruby, guess who's here?
Say hi to Ruby, Claire.

834
01:16:42,798 --> 01:16:45,767
- Hello, Ruby.
- Are you a ghost?

835
01:16:45,901 --> 01:16:47,562
No, I'm not.

836
01:16:47,636 --> 01:16:52,801
She was a ghost when she wasn't here.
Now she's just plain old Claire.

837
01:16:52,875 --> 01:16:58,211
Why don't you go down in the garden
and show Ruby you're not a ghost?

838
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:01,807
He said you were coming.
You took a long time.

839
01:17:02,618 --> 01:17:06,816
I know. It was gettin' kinda lonesome
here just the two of us, huh?

840
01:17:06,889 --> 01:17:09,949
I suppose. This is Marge.

841
01:17:10,025 --> 01:17:13,620
She was Vivian's doll
before he gave her to me.

842
01:17:13,696 --> 01:17:19,293
Say hello to Claire, Marge.
That nice lady is not a ghost.

843
01:17:19,368 --> 01:17:21,598
Hello, Claire! Welcome home!

844
01:17:22,705 --> 01:17:25,003
Welcome home, Claire.

845
01:17:26,475 --> 01:17:28,909
- She's followed him.
- Who?

846
01:17:28,978 --> 01:17:33,415
Vivian Thompson. He escaped
through that grate. Murdered a nurse.

847
01:17:33,482 --> 01:17:36,417
- When?
- 25 years ago. October 1972.

848
01:17:36,485 --> 01:17:38,976
- I'm lost, Doctor.
- Join the club.

849
01:17:40,122 --> 01:17:42,181
He killed her daughter.

850
01:17:43,058 --> 01:17:47,825
She shares his dreams. He snatched
another little girl called Ruby.

851
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:55,461
She's gone to stop him.
Call the police. Show them this.

852
01:17:55,604 --> 01:17:59,438
- Where are you going?
- Hammond, the Carlton Hotel.

853
01:18:00,309 --> 01:18:03,073
I'll make us somethin' to eat.
Is anyone hungry?

854
01:18:03,179 --> 01:18:05,079
How about "pasghetti"?

855
01:18:08,584 --> 01:18:12,042
Daddies can be just like mommies,
you know that?

856
01:18:12,121 --> 01:18:16,717
- Can they, honey?
- Vivian said so. They can cook too.

857
01:18:20,763 --> 01:18:23,095
What else did he tell you, Ruby?

858
01:18:23,165 --> 01:18:26,726
Told me my real mom
is up in Heaven waiting for me.

859
01:18:28,270 --> 01:18:30,204
That's Vivian's mom there.

860
01:18:30,272 --> 01:18:32,797
(Claire )
That's a tailor's dummy, Ruby.

861
01:18:32,908 --> 01:18:36,105
I know, but that's
the kind of clothes she wore.

862
01:18:36,178 --> 01:18:39,170
- Why does he keep them?
- For playing mom.

863
01:18:39,281 --> 01:18:44,150
He's very good at it. You should
hear the way his voice changes.

864
01:18:44,220 --> 01:18:46,313
Why does he do that?

865
01:18:46,388 --> 01:18:50,222
He says his daddy was a dollar
and his mommy was a song.

866
01:18:50,292 --> 01:18:51,623
A song?

867
01:18:51,694 --> 01:18:55,824
"Don't Sit Under The Apple Tree
With Anyone Else But Me."

868
01:18:55,965 --> 01:18:58,525
So that's his mother's song.

869
01:18:58,601 --> 01:19:01,069
That's what she was, that song.

870
01:19:14,550 --> 01:19:16,609
I don't like the cold.

871
01:19:18,621 --> 01:19:20,748
Ruby...

872
01:19:20,890 --> 01:19:23,154
Ruby, listen to me, OK?

873
01:19:23,225 --> 01:19:26,251
Vivian's sick, honey,
and he needs help.

874
01:19:26,328 --> 01:19:30,697
- It's possible he could hurt you.
- You're scaring me.

875
01:19:30,799 --> 01:19:34,291
- I'm gonna take you away from here.
- Vivian!

876
01:19:34,436 --> 01:19:37,030
Shh! Quiet!

877
01:19:37,106 --> 01:19:41,770
I've been looking for the can opener,
but I can't...find it!

878
01:19:43,946 --> 01:19:45,971
I know it's down there.

879
01:19:48,050 --> 01:19:51,417
Sometimes Mommy and Daddy fight
and that's bad.

880
01:19:51,487 --> 01:19:54,388
Sometimes they fight and that's good.

881
01:19:57,126 --> 01:19:59,686
She's so, so, so tired.

882
01:20:01,030 --> 01:20:03,055
You help me find it?

883
01:20:03,132 --> 01:20:07,865
Cos you're the girl. And when we
find it you can have some...snacks.

884
01:20:07,937 --> 01:20:10,997
And then when she wakes up
we'll feed her too.

885
01:20:12,474 --> 01:20:14,635
You gonna say you're sorry now?

886
01:20:14,710 --> 01:20:18,305
# Don't sit under the apple tree
with anyone else but me

887
01:20:18,380 --> 01:20:19,870
# Anyone else but me... #

888
01:20:19,949 --> 01:20:24,079
Cat got your tongue?
You're worse than your goddam daddy!

889
01:20:24,186 --> 01:20:27,815
# Don't sit under the apple tree
with anyone else but me

890
01:20:27,890 --> 01:20:31,758
# Till I come marching home... #

891
01:20:32,861 --> 01:20:35,352
(Song continues, muffled)

892
01:20:39,501 --> 01:20:41,401
(Whimpers )

893
01:20:47,076 --> 01:20:50,341
(Ruby ) You got him real mad.

894
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:55,241
That's why he put you
in bad mommy's clothes.

895
01:20:55,351 --> 01:20:57,842
He says he's disappointed in you.

896
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:03,017
He told me you'd be the loveliest
mommy in the whole wide world.

897
01:21:06,528 --> 01:21:08,587
Does your face hurt?

898
01:21:09,732 --> 01:21:11,825
I can kiss it better.

899
01:21:13,068 --> 01:21:16,094
Is that better?
Are you tied too tight?

900
01:21:16,205 --> 01:21:19,038
I'd loosen it,
but he might get mad again.

901
01:21:19,141 --> 01:21:22,440
- I'd never seen him mad before.
- (Vivian ) Ruby!

902
01:21:37,693 --> 01:21:40,059
- Dr Silverman?
- Yeah.

903
01:21:40,162 --> 01:21:42,460
You know this place?

904
01:21:42,531 --> 01:21:44,624
I was told about it.

905
01:21:44,700 --> 01:21:46,793
Let's get some light in there.

906
01:21:47,202 --> 01:21:49,227
Sweet Jesus!

907
01:21:52,675 --> 01:21:56,907
(Vivian ) # ..with anyone else but me

908
01:21:56,979 --> 01:21:59,447
# Anyone else but me

909
01:21:59,581 --> 01:22:01,606
# With anyone else but me #

910
01:22:03,652 --> 01:22:05,677
Bedtime, Ruby. Undo me, OK?

911
01:22:06,722 --> 01:22:10,624
Time to move over, Claire.
Thank you, sweetums.

912
01:22:10,693 --> 01:22:12,752
Go snuggle up with Mommy.

913
01:22:15,297 --> 01:22:17,993
I'd never hurt you, Claire.

914
01:22:24,139 --> 01:22:28,235
(Chuckles ) Didn't mind
hurting Paul, though, did I?

915
01:22:29,745 --> 01:22:32,179
I thought you'd be a better mommy.

916
01:22:32,247 --> 01:22:34,875
My mom was no good either.

917
01:22:35,084 --> 01:22:36,779
She...

918
01:22:38,220 --> 01:22:40,552
wore dresses like that.

919
01:22:45,227 --> 01:22:47,491
# Never knew my dad

920
01:22:47,596 --> 01:22:49,621
# Mom was all I had #

921
01:22:49,865 --> 01:22:51,162
NO!

922
01:22:55,404 --> 01:22:57,201
Please?

923
01:22:58,574 --> 01:23:00,735
Got eyes in the back of my head.

924
01:23:00,809 --> 01:23:05,906
When Mom said
it was time for bed, I...

925
01:23:06,014 --> 01:23:07,914
I believed her.

926
01:23:08,016 --> 01:23:10,780
Sorry if I'm moody.
It's been a long day.

927
01:23:10,886 --> 01:23:13,184
Things didn't turn out the way...

928
01:23:14,690 --> 01:23:16,749
I thought they would.

929
01:23:20,262 --> 01:23:24,198
Now I'm gonna kiss you...

930
01:23:24,299 --> 01:23:26,927
- good night.
- Ah!

931
01:23:27,069 --> 01:23:30,163
- Ow.
- Take a cheek, Ruby.

932
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:06,938
(Gasping)

933
01:24:08,177 --> 01:24:10,077
- Oh, God.
- Shh.

934
01:24:10,212 --> 01:24:12,077
- Claire?
- Shh, shh, shh, shh. Yes?

935
01:24:12,181 --> 01:24:14,046
- Claire?
- Yes?

936
01:24:14,216 --> 01:24:16,241
I just had a bad dream.

937
01:24:18,387 --> 01:24:21,447
I dreamt my mommy
was dead in the lake...

938
01:24:22,724 --> 01:24:25,056
and she had your face.

939
01:24:25,127 --> 01:24:27,152
(Sobs )

940
01:24:28,197 --> 01:24:31,064
Does that mean you're gonna kill me?

941
01:24:34,403 --> 01:24:36,462
I hope not.

942
01:24:47,416 --> 01:24:51,512
- Any word on the car she took?
- It was seen on Route Nine.

943
01:24:51,587 --> 01:24:53,851
- Great, let's go.
- All right.

944
01:25:00,562 --> 01:25:02,860
You're not such a bad mom.

945
01:25:06,635 --> 01:25:08,762
Don't get him mad again.

946
01:25:21,016 --> 01:25:22,074
(Screams )

947
01:25:22,150 --> 01:25:24,482
I don't like you any more.

948
01:25:24,553 --> 01:25:27,716
- I die in the lake, remember?
- I forgot that.

949
01:25:27,789 --> 01:25:30,952
- Maybe you develop a limp.
- I emptied it.

950
01:25:32,361 --> 01:25:34,295
(Claire ) Run!

951
01:25:35,864 --> 01:25:37,729
Run, Ruby!

952
01:25:39,768 --> 01:25:43,204
Run! Wait! Stop.

953
01:25:43,272 --> 01:25:45,934
Come here. Now, you gotta
be brave now, Ruby.

954
01:25:46,074 --> 01:25:49,532
- You gotta be brave, honey.
- Yes. You gotta come with me.

955
01:25:49,678 --> 01:25:52,408
- It's me he wants, not you.
- Claire!

956
01:25:55,951 --> 01:25:58,010
Vivian.

957
01:26:00,522 --> 01:26:02,251
Mom?

958
01:26:03,258 --> 01:26:06,159
You gonna say you're sorry now?

959
01:26:06,795 --> 01:26:09,161
I...don't...WANNA!

960
01:26:12,935 --> 01:26:14,994
(Sirens wailing)

961
01:26:16,138 --> 01:26:19,835
Route Nine. Just made visual
contact with ground units.

962
01:26:20,642 --> 01:26:22,769
(Vivian, wailing) Mom!

963
01:26:25,113 --> 01:26:27,172
Something's wrong.

964
01:26:32,621 --> 01:26:34,452
Mom?

965
01:26:36,358 --> 01:26:39,555
(Whispers ) The cat got my tongue.

966
01:26:42,998 --> 01:26:47,094
Mom? It hurts real bad.

967
01:26:47,169 --> 01:26:51,196
Ruby, where the fuck are you?!

968
01:26:57,980 --> 01:26:59,845
(Vivian ) Claire!

969
01:27:13,295 --> 01:27:15,320
It still hurts!

970
01:27:16,798 --> 01:27:18,891
Gonna kiss and make it better!

971
01:27:20,602 --> 01:27:24,231
Every couple has their problems.
We have to talk!

972
01:27:28,577 --> 01:27:30,442
Two-six to dispatch.

973
01:27:30,512 --> 01:27:35,347
I have a young girl fitting
the description of the subject.

974
01:27:36,318 --> 01:27:38,286
Don't you want to work it out?

975
01:27:38,387 --> 01:27:41,117
Or is it just too late
for me and you?

976
01:27:41,189 --> 01:27:44,681
I know how it goes now -
Ruby makes it to the road.

977
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:47,490
She stops a car, maybe a police car.

978
01:27:47,596 --> 01:27:51,965
The policeman comes in
and there's all this hostage stuff!

979
01:27:52,034 --> 01:27:54,662
- Is that how it goes?
- Uh-huh.

980
01:27:54,736 --> 01:27:57,136
Maybe Claire breaks her neck!

981
01:27:57,205 --> 01:28:00,538
Oh, I don't want this to happen(!)

982
01:28:00,609 --> 01:28:03,942
I really went out of my way
to bring you here!

983
01:28:04,012 --> 01:28:06,139
- Maybe Claire jumps!
- No, please!

984
01:28:10,585 --> 01:28:12,644
Claire!

985
01:28:13,522 --> 01:28:15,422
(Screams ) Claire!

986
01:28:33,875 --> 01:28:38,073
We got a lead. A girl found off
the interstate named Ruby.

987
01:28:38,146 --> 01:28:43,083
Head due east, we're looking
for a large wooden structure.

988
01:28:43,151 --> 01:28:45,779
- A cider factory.
- Roger that.

989
01:28:50,559 --> 01:28:52,686
Claire!

990
01:28:54,029 --> 01:28:55,963
Claire!

991
01:28:56,798 --> 01:28:58,891
Where are you?

992
01:29:16,084 --> 01:29:18,382
(Vivian screams )

993
01:29:59,861 --> 01:30:03,763
This is Air Seven.
Have established visual contact.

994
01:30:04,900 --> 01:30:08,427
Hey! Hey! Hey!

995
01:30:11,740 --> 01:30:13,708
He's back there!

996
01:30:13,975 --> 01:30:15,408
Back there!

997
01:30:18,613 --> 01:30:22,242
Now there's all this hostage stuff.
I told you so!

998
01:30:24,519 --> 01:30:28,046
- You've gotta give yourself up!
- But how?

999
01:30:28,156 --> 01:30:31,284
I let you go,
they'll make a real mess of me.

1000
01:30:35,664 --> 01:30:39,794
- It's empty! There's no bullets!
- Go away! Go away!

1001
01:30:41,002 --> 01:30:42,367
Shoot!

1002
01:31:26,348 --> 01:31:28,873
(Rebecca ) Mirror, mirror on the wall,

1003
01:31:28,950 --> 01:31:32,317
who's the fairest one of all?

1004
01:31:32,387 --> 01:31:35,220
You are.

1005
01:31:35,290 --> 01:31:38,191
Wrong. You are.

1006
01:32:03,051 --> 01:32:05,519
Come with me.

1007
01:32:06,087 --> 01:32:08,112
Where, darling?

1008
01:32:10,525 --> 01:32:12,390
Home.

1009
01:32:46,027 --> 01:32:49,326
(Judge ) The jury finds you
guilty, but insane,

1010
01:32:49,397 --> 01:32:51,865
so I cannot pass the death sentence.

1011
01:32:51,933 --> 01:32:55,096
You will be held
in a secure mental facility

1012
01:32:55,203 --> 01:32:58,730
until the state
deems it safe to release you,

1013
01:32:58,807 --> 01:33:01,401
which I hope
will not be in my lifetime.

1014
01:33:03,611 --> 01:33:05,442
I can live with that.

1015
01:33:34,476 --> 01:33:37,070
I can live with this, too.

1016
01:34:02,470 --> 01:34:04,700
(Groaning)

1017
01:34:09,711 --> 01:34:12,236
(Gasps )

1018
01:34:12,414 --> 01:34:16,282
Shh, shh. Pleasant dreams.

1019
01:34:41,876 --> 01:34:43,844
Oh...

1020
01:34:43,912 --> 01:34:45,937
(Screams )

1021
01:35:01,896 --> 01:35:03,864
Oh!

1022
01:35:17,378 --> 01:35:19,107
(Screams )

1023
01:35:26,054 --> 01:35:27,919
Help!

1024
01:35:29,591 --> 01:35:32,992
# I close my eyes

1025
01:35:34,162 --> 01:35:37,131
# Then I drift away

1026
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:41,933
# Into the magic night

1027
01:35:43,071 --> 01:35:46,131
# I softly say

1028
01:35:47,609 --> 01:35:50,669
# A silent prayer

1029
01:35:51,980 --> 01:35:55,006
# Like dreamers do

1030
01:35:56,417 --> 01:35:59,784
# Then I fall asleep to dream

1031
01:36:00,855 --> 01:36:04,052
# My dreams of you

1032
01:36:06,761 --> 01:36:08,820
# In dreams

1033
01:36:08,930 --> 01:36:11,160
# I walk

1034
01:36:11,232 --> 01:36:13,166
# With you

1035
01:36:15,670 --> 01:36:17,797
# In dreams

1036
01:36:17,872 --> 01:36:19,840
# I talk

1037
01:36:19,941 --> 01:36:22,136
# To you

1038
01:36:24,279 --> 01:36:28,648
# In dreams you're mine

1039
01:36:29,751 --> 01:36:32,618
# All of the time

1040
01:36:32,687 --> 01:36:36,817
# We're together

1041
01:36:36,891 --> 01:36:38,825
# In dreams

1042
01:36:39,327 --> 01:36:43,320
# In dreams

1043
01:36:44,465 --> 01:36:48,663
# But just before

1044
01:36:48,770 --> 01:36:50,704
# The dawn

1045
01:36:53,074 --> 01:36:55,508
# I awake

1046
01:36:55,610 --> 01:36:59,671
# And find you gone

1047
01:37:01,916 --> 01:37:04,077
# I can't help it

1048
01:37:04,152 --> 01:37:06,279
# I can't help it

1049
01:37:06,387 --> 01:37:08,753
# If I cry

1050
01:37:10,892 --> 01:37:15,022
# I remember that you said

1051
01:37:15,129 --> 01:37:18,121
# Goodbye

1052
01:37:19,934 --> 01:37:22,198
# It's too bad

1053
01:37:22,303 --> 01:37:26,239
# That all these things

1054
01:37:28,443 --> 01:37:31,412
# Can only happen

1055
01:37:31,512 --> 01:37:35,881
# In my dreams

1056
01:37:38,219 --> 01:37:41,814
# Only

1057
01:37:41,889 --> 01:37:45,017
# In dreams

1058
01:37:46,294 --> 01:37:51,425
# In beautiful

1059
01:37:51,799 --> 01:37:55,428
# Dreams #
