00:01:12,351 --> 00:01:14,114
Ready to go faster?

2
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,381
All right. No, no, no!

3
00:01:16,489 --> 00:01:18,116
You're gonna slide off.

4
00:01:18,224 --> 00:01:19,248
Oh!

5
00:01:19,358 --> 00:01:21,223
You all right?

6
00:01:21,327 --> 00:01:22,487
- Are you sliding?
- Yes.

7
00:01:22,595 --> 00:01:25,189
No, if you're sliding,
I'm going to stop.

8
00:01:25,298 --> 00:01:27,163
- No, no, no.
- You okay? Okay.

9
00:01:31,704 --> 00:01:32,671
More?

10
00:01:32,772 --> 00:01:34,672
Yes!

11
00:02:01,634 --> 00:02:03,761
That's funny.

12
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:06,303
I could've sworn
I saw a little girl

13
00:02:06,405 --> 00:02:09,033
by the name
of Emily come in here.

14
00:02:09,141 --> 00:02:10,768
Come out, come out,

15
00:02:10,876 --> 00:02:13,709
wherever you are...

16
00:02:13,813 --> 00:02:16,407
Could she be hiding
in the closet?

17
00:02:20,353 --> 00:02:23,811
I wonder where she could be.

18
00:02:28,561 --> 00:02:31,462
Hmm...

19
00:02:31,564 --> 00:02:34,829
Maybe my eyes
have deceived me.

20
00:02:34,934 --> 00:02:38,426
I'm invisible, Mommy.

21
00:02:38,537 --> 00:02:40,368
Well, if you're invisible...

22
00:02:41,907 --> 00:02:45,502
...then how could I... do this?!

23
00:02:49,015 --> 00:02:50,880
Did you know where I was?

24
00:02:50,983 --> 00:02:51,847
Not a clue.

25
00:02:53,853 --> 00:02:55,821
You want AleX?

26
00:03:05,097 --> 00:03:07,691
What is it?

27
00:03:09,869 --> 00:03:14,397
I love you more
than anything else in the world.

28
00:03:14,507 --> 00:03:16,372
You know that, don't you?

29
00:03:18,644 --> 00:03:21,044
I love you, too.

30
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:27,918
Good night, sweetheart.

31
00:03:29,622 --> 00:03:31,283
Make the face.

32
00:03:32,758 --> 00:03:35,818
Please.

33
00:03:39,899 --> 00:03:42,766
- Now, go to sleep.
- Okay.

34
00:03:51,844 --> 00:03:53,971
Mommy!

35
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,911
Sorry.

36
00:03:58,851 --> 00:04:01,046
Good night.

37
00:04:13,733 --> 00:04:15,894
You coming to bed?

38
00:04:16,001 --> 00:04:18,731
In a little while.

39
00:04:20,206 --> 00:04:22,174
Something you want to talk about?

40
00:04:26,612 --> 00:04:29,672
Some things are beyond therapy, David.

41
00:05:23,035 --> 00:05:24,935
Honey?

42
00:07:01,767 --> 00:07:03,997
I should've seen it coming.

43
00:07:04,103 --> 00:07:06,333
All the signs were there.

44
00:07:06,438 --> 00:07:09,407
The ones closest to you
are the hardest to judge.

45
00:07:09,508 --> 00:07:10,566
No, but I...

46
00:07:10,676 --> 00:07:12,769
I could've prevented it.

47
00:07:12,878 --> 00:07:14,436
David, it's not your fault.

48
00:07:14,546 --> 00:07:18,676
How long have
we known each other?

49
00:07:18,784 --> 00:07:21,810
Trust me when I tell you this.

50
00:07:21,921 --> 00:07:24,412
As difficult
as it may seem, you're...

51
00:07:24,523 --> 00:07:27,117
you're gonna have to try
and start over.

52
00:07:27,226 --> 00:07:30,286
We're gonna move.

53
00:07:30,396 --> 00:07:31,829
Upstate.

54
00:07:31,931 --> 00:07:33,091
The country.

55
00:07:36,368 --> 00:07:39,030
That's not eXactly what
I meant by "starting over. "

56
00:07:41,273 --> 00:07:42,797
What about Emily?

57
00:07:42,908 --> 00:07:45,342
This is a traumatic time for her.

58
00:07:45,444 --> 00:07:48,106
I think it's important she stays
here and works through this.

59
00:07:48,213 --> 00:07:49,646
No, here, she's
flooded with memories.

60
00:07:49,748 --> 00:07:52,717
I need to eXpose her
to a new environment,

61
00:07:52,818 --> 00:07:54,183
new things to do...

62
00:07:54,286 --> 00:07:56,151
She'd be losing another person
she depends on.

63
00:07:58,357 --> 00:08:00,120
It's only an hour away.

64
00:08:00,225 --> 00:08:03,717
And... you're always welcome
to come and see her.

65
00:08:03,829 --> 00:08:08,027
And right now, I need to do
what's right for Emily.

66
00:08:08,133 --> 00:08:10,465
I need to be
a full-time dad.

67
00:08:18,577 --> 00:08:22,513
I have a surprise for you.

68
00:08:33,192 --> 00:08:37,185
When I was your age,
my mom gave me one just like that.

69
00:08:37,296 --> 00:08:40,561
And whenever I was feeling sad,

70
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:44,158
I would open the lid,
and all my sorrows went away.

71
00:08:44,269 --> 00:08:46,066
Do you like it?

72
00:08:48,173 --> 00:08:49,435
Give me a hug.

73
00:08:59,251 --> 00:09:01,048
You're going to like it there.

74
00:09:03,522 --> 00:09:05,581
All right, let's go.

75
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:29,970
¢Ü¢Ü CHI LD

76
00:10:16,762 --> 00:10:22,530
¢Ü¢Ü

77
00:10:43,455 --> 00:10:46,151
¢Ü¢Ü

78
00:11:07,012 --> 00:11:08,479
Come on.

79
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,377
Let's take a look.

80
00:11:17,923 --> 00:11:19,914
Right on time.

81
00:11:20,025 --> 00:11:22,084
Dr. Callaway...

82
00:11:22,194 --> 00:11:23,752
Mr. Haskins.

83
00:11:23,862 --> 00:11:25,193
Hello.

84
00:11:25,297 --> 00:11:26,662
This is Sheriff Hafferty.

85
00:11:26,765 --> 00:11:27,823
Sheriff.

86
00:11:27,933 --> 00:11:29,560
He routinely checks
on the houses up here

87
00:11:29,668 --> 00:11:31,295
to make sure things
run smoothly.

88
00:11:31,403 --> 00:11:32,427
I see. Well, this is

89
00:11:32,538 --> 00:11:34,403
my daughter, Emily.
This is Sheriff Hafferty.

90
00:11:34,506 --> 00:11:35,734
Emily.

91
00:11:35,841 --> 00:11:38,401
How are you?

92
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:40,375
This is Mr. Haskins.

93
00:11:40,479 --> 00:11:42,344
He found us the house.

94
00:11:42,447 --> 00:11:45,007
Well, hello there, Emily.

95
00:11:45,117 --> 00:11:48,575
Think your dad did a good job
picking the house?

96
00:11:50,889 --> 00:11:52,789
She's still deciding.

97
00:11:54,893 --> 00:11:56,758
Well, she sure is pretty.

98
00:11:56,862 --> 00:11:58,056
Thank you.

99
00:11:58,163 --> 00:11:59,721
As I mentioned,

100
00:11:59,831 --> 00:12:01,196
Woodland Estates
is mainly

101
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,267
a summer community.

102
00:12:02,367 --> 00:12:04,892
May be a little quiet
up here till then.

103
00:12:05,003 --> 00:12:06,527
Hope that's not a problem.

104
00:12:06,638 --> 00:12:08,469
- Not at all.
- Great.

105
00:12:08,574 --> 00:12:10,098
Let me show you
around the back.

106
00:12:10,209 --> 00:12:11,403
You ever spent

107
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:12,943
much time in the country?

108
00:12:13,045 --> 00:12:14,239
Not much.

109
00:12:14,346 --> 00:12:16,246
I used to camp
when I was little,

110
00:12:16,348 --> 00:12:18,509
but I was always scared
of the woods.

111
00:12:19,751 --> 00:12:22,311
Nothing to be scared of
in these woods.

112
00:12:22,421 --> 00:12:23,649
Picked a nice spot.

113
00:12:23,755 --> 00:12:25,484
Biggest house on the lake.

114
00:12:25,591 --> 00:12:28,822
Sheriff, if you'd like
to do the honors;

115
00:12:28,927 --> 00:12:31,589
let Dr. Callaway
into his new home.

116
00:12:31,697 --> 00:12:33,221
Figure out which key...

117
00:12:33,332 --> 00:12:36,563
Did you see where
my daughter went?

118
00:12:36,668 --> 00:12:38,101
Emily!

119
00:12:40,272 --> 00:12:42,297
Emily!

120
00:12:43,675 --> 00:12:45,506
Emily!

121
00:12:56,288 --> 00:12:58,449
Honey?

122
00:12:58,557 --> 00:13:00,252
You okay?

123
00:13:03,695 --> 00:13:05,356
Come on.
Let's go back.

124
00:13:05,464 --> 00:13:07,762
Come on.

125
00:13:07,866 --> 00:13:09,527
Come on.

126
00:13:14,806 --> 00:13:18,435
Mr. Haskins, Sheriff...
we'll take it from here.

127
00:13:33,225 --> 00:13:35,785
Spaghetti and meatballs
is your favorite dish.

128
00:13:35,894 --> 00:13:38,385
You're not hungry?

129
00:13:53,345 --> 00:13:55,313
I'd like to go to bed now.

130
00:14:02,954 --> 00:14:05,514
I'll come up
and kiss you good night.

131
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:19,765
Oh, that's funny.

132
00:14:19,871 --> 00:14:22,101
I could have sworn
I saw a little girl

133
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:24,835
by the name of Emily
come in here.

134
00:14:24,943 --> 00:14:27,207
I wonder...

135
00:14:27,312 --> 00:14:30,713
where she's hiding.

136
00:14:30,816 --> 00:14:34,980
Could she be...
could she be...

137
00:14:35,087 --> 00:14:36,554
under the bed?!

138
00:14:36,655 --> 00:14:38,418
No.

139
00:14:38,523 --> 00:14:40,650
Could she be...

140
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:43,751
hiding...

141
00:14:43,862 --> 00:14:48,196
Let's see, where
could she be hiding?

142
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,894
Could she be
hiding in the... closet!

143
00:15:06,818 --> 00:15:09,309
Okay...

144
00:15:09,421 --> 00:15:11,582
since it's the first night
in a new house,

145
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:15,057
I thought it would be a good
time to start a new diary.

146
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,593
Each day you
can write down

147
00:15:16,695 --> 00:15:18,253
your feelings
and thoughts,

148
00:15:18,363 --> 00:15:19,694
and then, one day,
you can look back

149
00:15:19,798 --> 00:15:21,129
and see
how much they've changed.

150
00:15:21,233 --> 00:15:22,666
Hmm?

151
00:15:27,873 --> 00:15:30,501
I love you more than anything
else in the world, sweetheart.

152
00:15:30,609 --> 00:15:32,338
You know that.

153
00:15:32,444 --> 00:15:35,641
That's what Mommy said.

154
00:15:35,747 --> 00:15:37,442
Hmm?

155
00:15:37,549 --> 00:15:41,417
Before she killed herself.

156
00:15:44,656 --> 00:15:46,681
Sweetheart,
she meant what she said.

157
00:15:46,792 --> 00:15:50,922
And so do I.

158
00:15:52,964 --> 00:15:54,158
You want me to put this

159
00:15:54,266 --> 00:15:56,166
over here?

160
00:15:56,268 --> 00:15:59,499
Okay.

161
00:15:59,604 --> 00:16:01,868
All right.

162
00:16:01,973 --> 00:16:03,702
Good night.

163
00:16:13,685 --> 00:16:16,449
Good night, AleX.

164
00:18:07,766 --> 00:18:11,793
Emily? Emily!

165
00:18:11,903 --> 00:18:13,734
Em?

166
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:24,712
Emily?

167
00:18:24,816 --> 00:18:26,078
Oh, there you are.

168
00:18:26,184 --> 00:18:27,913
Come on, sweetheart.

169
00:18:28,019 --> 00:18:31,284
We're going into town.
We have some errands to do.

170
00:18:35,961 --> 00:18:36,985
Oh...

171
00:18:37,095 --> 00:18:38,585
Hello.

172
00:18:38,697 --> 00:18:40,130
Hi... Hi, there.

173
00:18:40,231 --> 00:18:42,597
I- I'm Laura.
I live neXt door.

174
00:18:42,701 --> 00:18:44,532
Oh, I'm David.
How are you?

175
00:18:44,636 --> 00:18:46,934
Uh, here.
These are for you.

176
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:48,733
Oh, thank you very much.

177
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,331
My husband and I made
the preserves ourselves.

178
00:18:51,443 --> 00:18:53,240
Oh, well...

179
00:18:53,345 --> 00:18:56,143
I didn't even realize
anyone else lived up here.

180
00:18:56,247 --> 00:18:58,545
Well, it does get pretty quiet
in the off season.

181
00:19:00,285 --> 00:19:02,014
Oh, this is my
daughter, Emily.

182
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,645
Emily, say hello to Laura.

183
00:19:04,756 --> 00:19:05,814
She's our neighbor.

184
00:19:05,924 --> 00:19:07,391
Isn't she adorable?

185
00:19:07,492 --> 00:19:09,687
You going to say hi?

186
00:19:12,263 --> 00:19:13,491
Well, she gets a little shy

187
00:19:13,598 --> 00:19:14,656
around new faces.

188
00:19:14,766 --> 00:19:16,097
I understand.

189
00:19:16,201 --> 00:19:19,329
It's going to be a real treat
having both of you here.

190
00:19:22,774 --> 00:19:24,833
Oh, you're on your way out.

191
00:19:24,943 --> 00:19:26,342
I won't keep you.

192
00:19:26,444 --> 00:19:28,878
Um, if you need anything,
don't hesitate to stop by.

193
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,004
Same here.

194
00:19:30,115 --> 00:19:31,776
And thank you
for all the preserves.

195
00:19:31,883 --> 00:19:33,544
The peach and apricot preserves.

196
00:19:33,652 --> 00:19:35,051
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

197
00:19:35,153 --> 00:19:37,348
I'm gonna put this inside.

198
00:19:46,765 --> 00:19:48,596
Amy, don't swing so high.

199
00:19:51,703 --> 00:19:54,035
I'm going
to tell your mom.

200
00:20:06,618 --> 00:20:11,214
Would you listen to me?

201
00:20:25,537 --> 00:20:27,437
Hi.

202
00:20:27,539 --> 00:20:29,700
Hi.

203
00:20:29,808 --> 00:20:33,039
I have, uh,
a daughter the same age.

204
00:20:34,412 --> 00:20:35,743
She's in the car.

205
00:20:35,847 --> 00:20:38,441
Oh.

206
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:40,643
I'm Elizabeth.

207
00:20:40,752 --> 00:20:43,277
Elizabeth Young.

208
00:20:43,388 --> 00:20:45,822
Hi.
David Callaway.

209
00:20:45,924 --> 00:20:46,982
- How are you?
- Good.

210
00:20:47,092 --> 00:20:48,389
Nice to meet you.

211
00:20:48,493 --> 00:20:49,892
Are you visiting?

212
00:20:49,994 --> 00:20:52,462
Just moved up
from the city.

213
00:20:52,564 --> 00:20:54,054
Oh, usually it's
the other way around.

214
00:20:54,165 --> 00:20:55,894
I know.

215
00:20:58,369 --> 00:20:59,836
She your kid?

216
00:20:59,938 --> 00:21:01,599
Oh, no. No.

217
00:21:01,706 --> 00:21:03,333
She's my sister's kid.

218
00:21:03,441 --> 00:21:05,238
I'm the honorary baby-sitter.

219
00:21:05,343 --> 00:21:06,833
Watch.

220
00:21:06,945 --> 00:21:08,776
Amy, be careful.

221
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,939
Amy...

222
00:21:13,184 --> 00:21:14,378
Oh...

223
00:21:14,486 --> 00:21:16,454
- Amy.
- She all right?

224
00:21:16,554 --> 00:21:19,114
Amy,Jesus,
are you all right?

225
00:21:21,693 --> 00:21:23,786
That's very funny.

226
00:21:23,895 --> 00:21:25,487
Oh, my God, you're
going to make me nuts,

227
00:21:25,597 --> 00:21:26,621
you know that?

228
00:21:29,033 --> 00:21:30,625
Is your daughter
this crazy?

229
00:21:39,144 --> 00:21:40,372
Where's AleX?

230
00:21:40,478 --> 00:21:42,946
I don't like her anymore.

231
00:21:44,716 --> 00:21:47,014
Did I just hear
what I think I heard?

232
00:21:47,118 --> 00:21:48,779
Are you mad, Daddy?

233
00:21:48,887 --> 00:21:50,548
No, I'm not mad at all, honey.

234
00:21:50,655 --> 00:21:51,622
I think it's great.

235
00:21:51,723 --> 00:21:52,690
You do?

236
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:54,122
Yeah.

237
00:21:54,225 --> 00:21:56,159
Good.

238
00:21:56,261 --> 00:21:59,162
Because I have a new friend.

239
00:21:59,264 --> 00:22:02,358
A new friend? Okay.

240
00:22:02,467 --> 00:22:05,231
Let me guess.
Is it, um...

241
00:22:05,336 --> 00:22:06,496
Veronica?

242
00:22:06,604 --> 00:22:08,367
No.

243
00:22:08,473 --> 00:22:10,737
Uh, is it, uh, Patty?

244
00:22:12,911 --> 00:22:13,741
Is it...

245
00:22:13,845 --> 00:22:14,971
He's not a doll.

246
00:22:16,915 --> 00:22:17,939
He's...

247
00:22:18,049 --> 00:22:20,517
Not a doll.

248
00:22:20,618 --> 00:22:22,017
He.

249
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,350
Okay, well,

250
00:22:24,455 --> 00:22:27,049
if he's not a doll,
then who is he?

251
00:22:27,158 --> 00:22:28,921
He doesn't want me
to talk about him.

252
00:22:29,027 --> 00:22:30,187
Doesn't want you
to talk about him?

253
00:22:30,295 --> 00:22:31,626
No.

254
00:22:31,729 --> 00:22:32,957
Well, what if I promise

255
00:22:33,064 --> 00:22:34,656
to keep it a secret,
could you tell me then?

256
00:22:39,704 --> 00:22:42,036
So, what's his name?

257
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:44,540
He told me to call him Charlie.

258
00:22:44,642 --> 00:22:47,440
Charlie? Oh, that's
an interesting name.

259
00:22:47,545 --> 00:22:49,274
Charlie.

260
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,280
When did you meet Charlie?

261
00:22:51,382 --> 00:22:52,371
Today.

262
00:22:52,483 --> 00:22:54,417
When we went to town?

263
00:22:54,519 --> 00:22:56,783
It was before that.

264
00:22:56,888 --> 00:22:59,448
Before that. Huh.

265
00:22:59,557 --> 00:23:04,256
Is he... here right now?

266
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,034
I think he's sleeping.

267
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,401
Okay.

268
00:23:13,504 --> 00:23:15,529
Well, in that case,

269
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,972
we better not wake him, hmm?

270
00:23:18,076 --> 00:23:20,271
It's not unusual

271
00:23:20,378 --> 00:23:22,972
for a traumatized child
to create imaginary friends.

272
00:23:23,081 --> 00:23:25,777
I know, I just wish
she'd confide in me

273
00:23:25,884 --> 00:23:27,442
instead of using fantasy.

274
00:23:27,552 --> 00:23:28,883
Trauma causes pain.

275
00:23:28,987 --> 00:23:31,922
Eventually the mind
will find a way to release it.

276
00:23:32,023 --> 00:23:33,251
No kidding.

277
00:23:33,358 --> 00:23:35,292
Don't forget: I'm the one
who taught you that stuff.

278
00:23:35,393 --> 00:23:37,452
As a matter of fact, you did, yes.

279
00:23:37,562 --> 00:23:39,655
Just have fun with her, David.

280
00:23:39,764 --> 00:23:41,061
Play with her.

281
00:23:41,165 --> 00:23:43,224
That's what she needs.

282
00:24:20,071 --> 00:24:22,938
These are beginner rods.

283
00:24:27,979 --> 00:24:31,039
Let's see... two rods,

284
00:24:31,149 --> 00:24:33,709
$41.50 each...

285
00:24:46,998 --> 00:24:48,693
Plus bait and tackle...

286
00:24:53,538 --> 00:24:55,028
Sheriff.

287
00:24:59,277 --> 00:25:02,508
You parked in a handicap zone.

288
00:25:04,816 --> 00:25:06,078
Oh, I didn't even realize.

289
00:25:06,184 --> 00:25:08,175
Could you give me a break?
I didn't realize.

290
00:25:10,188 --> 00:25:12,156
Enjoy your day.

291
00:25:19,263 --> 00:25:20,560
Eh, so much for

292
00:25:20,665 --> 00:25:22,064
small town
hospitality, honey.

293
00:25:22,166 --> 00:25:23,758
- Shut the door.
- We broke the law.

294
00:25:23,868 --> 00:25:25,802
I know we broke the law.

295
00:25:25,903 --> 00:25:27,200
Shut the door.

296
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:33,978
The Loch Ness Monster.

297
00:25:34,078 --> 00:25:35,238
What?

298
00:25:35,346 --> 00:25:36,745
You know what that is?

299
00:25:36,848 --> 00:25:39,146
It's in Scotland.

300
00:25:41,686 --> 00:25:43,813
This is a good spot, huh?

301
00:26:08,813 --> 00:26:10,940
Honey, what are you doing?

302
00:26:14,485 --> 00:26:16,783
You think that's a good idea?

303
00:26:20,024 --> 00:26:24,051
Emily, we have bait.

304
00:26:27,732 --> 00:26:29,893
See?

305
00:26:30,001 --> 00:26:33,300
All right.

306
00:26:37,275 --> 00:26:39,004
Did you have
a nice time today?

307
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:40,543
It was okay.

308
00:26:40,645 --> 00:26:42,636
Just okay?

309
00:26:42,747 --> 00:26:44,442
Mm...

310
00:26:44,549 --> 00:26:47,279
Well, then, what could we
have done to make it better?

311
00:26:50,922 --> 00:26:52,480
What if Charlie was there?

312
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:54,387
Would he have made it better?

313
00:26:54,492 --> 00:26:57,928
He's a lot of fun.

314
00:26:58,029 --> 00:26:59,326
Fun like how?

315
00:27:02,266 --> 00:27:04,996
Fun like Mommy.

316
00:27:11,609 --> 00:27:14,703
It's a little stuffy in here.

317
00:27:33,364 --> 00:27:34,854
It's stuck.

318
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,300
It's okay, Daddy.

319
00:27:38,402 --> 00:27:40,836
It just...

320
00:27:53,117 --> 00:27:56,416
CROWD
... three, two, one...

321
00:27:56,521 --> 00:27:59,251
Happy New Year!

322
00:29:21,772 --> 00:29:23,296
Emily, why would you do this?

323
00:29:23,407 --> 00:29:24,999
I didn't do it.

324
00:29:25,109 --> 00:29:26,701
What do you mean,
you didn't do it?

325
00:29:26,811 --> 00:29:28,073
There's nobody here but us.

326
00:29:28,179 --> 00:29:29,840
It wasn't me.

327
00:29:31,716 --> 00:29:34,241
This is your writing,
and these are your crayons, honey.

328
00:29:36,554 --> 00:29:37,748
It's all right. Just tell me.

329
00:29:37,855 --> 00:29:38,981
You don't have to lie to me.

330
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:40,489
I'm not lying.

331
00:29:40,591 --> 00:29:42,582
Okay, well,
if you didn't do it,

332
00:29:42,693 --> 00:29:44,354
then who did?

333
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:48,328
It was Charlie.

334
00:29:53,137 --> 00:29:54,770
she thinks I"m responsible

335
00:29:54,805 --> 00:29:56,033
she thinks I"m responsible

336
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,402
for Alison's death.

337
00:29:57,508 --> 00:30:00,705
It's Charlie
that holds you responsible.

338
00:30:00,811 --> 00:30:02,073
Use him, David.

339
00:30:02,179 --> 00:30:04,044
Use him to get through to her.

340
00:30:04,148 --> 00:30:05,809
He's the key.

341
00:30:05,916 --> 00:30:08,612
I- I have to go, I...

342
00:30:08,719 --> 00:30:10,812
I think I found her
a real friend.

343
00:30:10,921 --> 00:30:12,320
Really? That's great.

344
00:30:12,423 --> 00:30:13,583
Call me if you need me, okay?

345
00:30:13,691 --> 00:30:15,283
- Bye.
- Okay, bye.

346
00:30:17,261 --> 00:30:19,388
Hi.

347
00:30:19,497 --> 00:30:20,464
- Hi.
- Hi.

348
00:30:20,564 --> 00:30:21,553
Hi, Amy.

349
00:30:23,801 --> 00:30:25,393
Glad you came.

350
00:30:25,503 --> 00:30:28,700
Em... we have guests.

351
00:30:28,806 --> 00:30:30,706
Emily?

352
00:30:36,914 --> 00:30:38,541
This is Elizabeth.

353
00:30:38,649 --> 00:30:39,673
Hi, Emily.

354
00:30:39,784 --> 00:30:41,081
Emily, this is Amy.

355
00:30:41,185 --> 00:30:42,982
Hi.

356
00:30:44,689 --> 00:30:46,884
Hi.

357
00:30:46,991 --> 00:30:49,551
Coffee-maker
has a mind of its own.

358
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:51,218
Oh, God...

359
00:30:57,134 --> 00:30:59,932
Thank you.

360
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,374
So, is that your wife?

361
00:31:08,946 --> 00:31:10,504
She passed away.

362
00:31:13,551 --> 00:31:15,212
I'm sorry.

363
00:31:15,319 --> 00:31:19,449
No matter how many times I say it,
it still sounds so strange.

364
00:31:19,557 --> 00:31:21,388
Must be hard on Emily.

365
00:31:21,492 --> 00:31:24,222
Have you ever been married?

366
00:31:24,328 --> 00:31:25,955
Actually, I just got divorced.

367
00:31:26,063 --> 00:31:27,928
I'm living with my sister

368
00:31:28,032 --> 00:31:31,490
and her husband till I can
figure out my neXt move.

369
00:31:33,537 --> 00:31:37,268
Best way to get over the past
is to start something new.

370
00:31:37,375 --> 00:31:40,435
That's why we're here.

371
00:31:42,179 --> 00:31:44,010
AMY
... baby, wrap it up

372
00:31:44,115 --> 00:31:45,673
in toilet paper,
put it in the incubator.

373
00:31:45,783 --> 00:31:47,808
What shall it be?

374
00:31:47,918 --> 00:31:50,910
Oh! By the way,
this is Penelope.

375
00:31:51,021 --> 00:31:52,648
Thanks.

376
00:31:52,757 --> 00:31:55,157
You're gonna like it here.

377
00:31:55,259 --> 00:31:57,523
It's a lot of fun.

378
00:31:57,628 --> 00:31:59,960
Well, it's not always fun,

379
00:32:00,064 --> 00:32:03,522
but there are lots
of fun things to do.

380
00:32:05,436 --> 00:32:07,131
Oh...

381
00:32:07,238 --> 00:32:09,763
She's beautiful.

382
00:32:11,208 --> 00:32:12,732
What's her name?

383
00:32:17,014 --> 00:32:19,414
Well, you don't talk much,
do you?

384
00:32:19,517 --> 00:32:22,816
You shouldn't be here.

385
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,251
Why not?

386
00:32:24,355 --> 00:32:26,220
You could get hurt.

387
00:32:36,066 --> 00:32:38,000
- Oh, my God.
- Okay.

388
00:32:38,102 --> 00:32:41,697
So, um... so,
you have my number.

389
00:32:41,806 --> 00:32:43,501
I'll talk to you soon.

390
00:32:43,607 --> 00:32:44,631
Okay...

391
00:32:44,742 --> 00:32:46,801
I guess I should go.

392
00:32:46,911 --> 00:32:48,242
- Yeah.
- Okay.

393
00:32:48,345 --> 00:32:49,573
- Bye.
- Bye.

394
00:32:52,716 --> 00:32:55,207
Bye, Emily.

395
00:33:04,562 --> 00:33:08,157
So... what'd you
think of Amy?

396
00:33:08,265 --> 00:33:11,063
Did you like her?

397
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:14,194
I don't need any more friends.

398
00:34:05,456 --> 00:34:06,787
Good, good.

399
00:34:06,891 --> 00:34:07,949
There.

400
00:34:08,058 --> 00:34:09,252
Perfect.

401
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,520
Hi.

402
00:34:10,628 --> 00:34:12,095
Hey. Sorry.

403
00:34:12,196 --> 00:34:13,925
I didn't mean to intrude.

404
00:34:14,031 --> 00:34:15,089
Oh, uh...

405
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,257
I'm Steven.

406
00:34:16,367 --> 00:34:17,527
Laura's husband from neXt door.

407
00:34:17,635 --> 00:34:18,693
Oh, yeah. Hi.

408
00:34:18,802 --> 00:34:20,235
It's David, right?

409
00:34:20,337 --> 00:34:21,964
Yes, it's David.

410
00:34:22,072 --> 00:34:24,063
Just wanted to say hi.

411
00:34:24,174 --> 00:34:26,404
Nice to...
nice to meet you, Steven.

412
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:27,772
Figured, you know...

413
00:34:27,878 --> 00:34:30,039
gonna be neighbors,
you might as well be neighborly, right?

414
00:34:30,147 --> 00:34:31,910
Right.

415
00:34:32,016 --> 00:34:34,985
Uh... well, you're gonna have
to eXcuse us, Steven.

416
00:34:35,085 --> 00:34:36,074
We have a busy day

417
00:34:36,186 --> 00:34:38,950
ahead of us.
Honey, come on.

418
00:34:40,391 --> 00:34:42,291
Emily...

419
00:34:42,393 --> 00:34:44,725
let's go.

420
00:34:47,064 --> 00:34:49,555
Bye.

421
00:34:52,603 --> 00:34:54,070
Listen, you need anything,

422
00:34:54,171 --> 00:34:55,763
just give a shout, will you?

423
00:34:55,873 --> 00:34:58,774
Okay. Thank you.
See you around.

424
00:34:58,876 --> 00:35:00,002
David?

425
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:01,338
Yeah?

426
00:35:04,148 --> 00:35:07,276
You're very lucky to have
such a beautiful daughter.

427
00:35:07,384 --> 00:35:10,319
Thank you.

428
00:35:21,565 --> 00:35:23,260
You remember
what I told you

429
00:35:23,367 --> 00:35:25,232
about not talking
to strangers?

430
00:35:25,336 --> 00:35:26,633
He's not a stranger.

431
00:35:26,737 --> 00:35:27,726
What do you mean?

432
00:35:27,838 --> 00:35:29,066
He's our neighbor.

433
00:35:29,173 --> 00:35:31,437
As far as I'm concerned,
he's a stranger, honey.

434
00:35:31,542 --> 00:35:33,510
Don't walk away
when I'm talking to you.

435
00:35:33,611 --> 00:35:34,771
I'm telling you something.

436
00:35:34,878 --> 00:35:36,937
I'm sorry, Daddy.
Weren't you finished?

437
00:35:37,047 --> 00:35:38,071
No, I wasn't finished.

438
00:35:38,182 --> 00:35:40,047
What I'm saying is,
it's very important

439
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:42,141
for you to listen
when I tell you something.

440
00:35:42,252 --> 00:35:43,276
Okay.

441
00:35:43,387 --> 00:35:44,911
Okay?

442
00:36:24,695 --> 00:36:27,562
What are you doing,
sweetheart?

443
00:36:27,665 --> 00:36:28,723
Nothing.

444
00:36:28,832 --> 00:36:30,094
What's so funny?

445
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,930
Is Charlie here?

446
00:36:33,037 --> 00:36:34,436
He just left.

447
00:36:34,538 --> 00:36:36,096
Where'd he go?

448
00:36:44,314 --> 00:36:45,975
Did you open that?

449
00:36:46,083 --> 00:36:48,074
I thought you did.

450
00:37:22,886 --> 00:37:24,820
I want to talk to Charlie.

451
00:37:24,922 --> 00:37:26,514
What would you like
to talk about?

452
00:37:26,623 --> 00:37:29,251
I'd like to talk to him
about all sorts of things.

453
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:30,383
Like what?

454
00:37:30,494 --> 00:37:34,726
Like, uh... well,
what makes him happy...

455
00:37:34,832 --> 00:37:38,131
what makes him sad...

456
00:37:38,235 --> 00:37:39,293
So, what do you say?

457
00:37:39,403 --> 00:37:42,133
You think you can introduce us?

458
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:44,434
I don't think that's going to work.

459
00:37:44,541 --> 00:37:45,565
Why's that?

460
00:37:45,676 --> 00:37:48,474
He doesn't like you very much.

461
00:37:48,579 --> 00:37:51,980
Oh, why doesn't he
like me very much?

462
00:37:52,082 --> 00:37:55,574
Does it have something
to do with Mommy?

463
00:37:55,686 --> 00:37:57,745
Honey?

464
00:37:59,857 --> 00:38:02,917
What does he tell you?

465
00:38:20,778 --> 00:38:23,110
EMI LY
... three, one thousand,

466
00:38:23,213 --> 00:38:24,475
four, one thousand,

467
00:38:24,581 --> 00:38:26,674
five, one thousand,

468
00:38:26,784 --> 00:38:28,274
siX, one thousand,

469
00:38:28,385 --> 00:38:29,716
seven, one thousand,

470
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:31,412
eight, one thousand,

471
00:38:31,522 --> 00:38:33,046
nine, one thousand,

472
00:38:33,157 --> 00:38:34,624
ten, one thousand.

473
00:38:34,725 --> 00:38:39,389
Ready or not, here I come.

474
00:39:02,152 --> 00:39:05,315
Charlie...

475
00:39:06,757 --> 00:39:09,521
Charlie...

476
00:39:35,385 --> 00:39:38,252
Charlie...

477
00:39:41,758 --> 00:39:45,888
Come out, come out
wherever you are.

478
00:40:56,266 --> 00:40:58,427
Charlie?

479
00:40:58,535 --> 00:41:00,696
Is that you?

480
00:41:07,077 --> 00:41:08,704
Emily!

481
00:41:10,314 --> 00:41:11,508
Emily!

482
00:41:22,459 --> 00:41:23,892
Emily!

483
00:41:25,162 --> 00:41:26,493
Where are you?

484
00:41:29,466 --> 00:41:30,490
What happened?

485
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,692
Why are you down here?

486
00:41:31,802 --> 00:41:34,703
Emily, talk to me.

487
00:41:34,805 --> 00:41:36,739
He was hiding.

488
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:37,738
Who was hiding?

489
00:41:37,841 --> 00:41:39,172
In the dark.

490
00:41:47,584 --> 00:41:50,678
Can I go to bed now?

491
00:42:08,772 --> 00:42:10,171
Hi.

492
00:42:10,273 --> 00:42:12,332
Hi.

493
00:42:12,442 --> 00:42:14,342
Do you have a minute?

494
00:42:14,444 --> 00:42:17,880
Yeah. Oh, sure.
Come on in.

495
00:42:17,981 --> 00:42:20,643
Thank you. Thank you.

496
00:42:24,354 --> 00:42:26,754
I wanted to apologize

497
00:42:26,857 --> 00:42:27,983
for my husband.

498
00:42:28,091 --> 00:42:30,082
He said he had a...
awkward moment

499
00:42:30,193 --> 00:42:31,888
yesterday
with you and Emily.

500
00:42:31,995 --> 00:42:33,257
That's all right.
Don't worry about it.

501
00:42:33,363 --> 00:42:35,388
He's harmless, really.
He wouldn't hurt a fly.

502
00:42:35,499 --> 00:42:37,558
That's fine.

503
00:42:37,667 --> 00:42:39,726
It's just that...

504
00:42:39,836 --> 00:42:43,602
we lost a child recently-
a girl...

505
00:42:43,707 --> 00:42:48,474
and in some ways,
Emily reminds us of her.

506
00:42:48,578 --> 00:42:51,877
I see.

507
00:42:51,982 --> 00:42:55,110
He was just... reaching out. Hmm?

508
00:42:59,189 --> 00:43:03,091
There is nothing worse
in this world than losing a child.

509
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:48,717
Here, taste this.

510
00:43:48,818 --> 00:43:50,809
I think it may be too salty.

511
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:51,978
Oh. Okay.

512
00:43:54,724 --> 00:43:55,748
- Not bad.
- Really?

513
00:43:55,859 --> 00:43:57,918
- Not bad.
- Oh, good.

514
00:43:58,027 --> 00:43:59,824
Really good.

515
00:44:01,698 --> 00:44:04,826
Wow! You look so pretty.

516
00:44:04,934 --> 00:44:08,062
You didn't have to get
all dressed up for me.

517
00:44:09,706 --> 00:44:11,003
Honey, would you go upstairs

518
00:44:11,107 --> 00:44:12,938
and change
into something else, please?

519
00:44:13,042 --> 00:44:15,374
Don't you like it?

520
00:44:15,478 --> 00:44:18,242
Not for dinner, no.

521
00:44:18,348 --> 00:44:19,576
Why not?

522
00:44:19,682 --> 00:44:21,411
You know why.

523
00:44:21,518 --> 00:44:24,112
She looks so pretty.
Let's just eat.

524
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:27,678
I think you look
really beautiful.

525
00:44:40,570 --> 00:44:43,539
Did Daddy tell you
that my mommy died?

526
00:44:46,743 --> 00:44:48,904
Yes, he did.

527
00:44:49,012 --> 00:44:50,104
And I'm very sorry.

528
00:44:50,213 --> 00:44:51,771
Did he tell you
how she died?

529
00:44:51,881 --> 00:44:55,146
Honey, I don't think Elizabeth
really wants to hear

530
00:44:55,251 --> 00:44:56,445
how that happened,
okay?

531
00:44:56,553 --> 00:44:57,645
She killed herself
in our bathtub.

532
00:44:57,754 --> 00:44:59,221
- Emily...
- Slit her wrists with a razor.

533
00:44:59,322 --> 00:45:01,381
Emily.

534
00:45:01,491 --> 00:45:04,460
That's enough.

535
00:45:09,532 --> 00:45:11,659
Emily, I brought you something.

536
00:45:11,768 --> 00:45:14,293
Your dad asked me to bring over

537
00:45:14,404 --> 00:45:15,837
some of Amy's books.

538
00:45:15,939 --> 00:45:17,930
These were some
of my favorites

539
00:45:18,041 --> 00:45:20,009
when I was your age.

540
00:45:20,109 --> 00:45:22,100
Oh, that's great.

541
00:45:22,212 --> 00:45:24,908
Give you a chance to see
what the other kids are reading

542
00:45:25,014 --> 00:45:26,003
before you get started.

543
00:45:26,115 --> 00:45:28,640
You gonna say thanks?

544
00:45:31,754 --> 00:45:34,052
Emily...

545
00:45:36,759 --> 00:45:39,660
Emily... Emily, stop it.
That's enough.

546
00:45:39,762 --> 00:45:41,161
Do you like her, Daddy?

547
00:45:41,264 --> 00:45:42,788
- Stop this.
- Charlie says you do.

548
00:45:42,899 --> 00:45:44,799
- Go to your room.
- He says you like her

549
00:45:44,901 --> 00:45:46,493
- as much as Mommy.
- Go to your room. To your room.

550
00:45:46,603 --> 00:45:48,867
If you're going to behave
this way, go to your room.

551
00:45:50,306 --> 00:45:52,536
Let's hope you don't
wind up like her.

552
00:46:04,754 --> 00:46:06,619
I'm sorry.

553
00:46:06,723 --> 00:46:07,655
Who's Charlie?

554
00:46:07,757 --> 00:46:10,385
Oh, he's her imaginary friend.

555
00:46:10,493 --> 00:46:12,222
Her only friend.

556
00:46:17,166 --> 00:46:22,035
I always wanted her to have
a better childhood than I had.

557
00:46:22,138 --> 00:46:23,867
Now look.

558
00:46:29,112 --> 00:46:31,012
Drive safely.

559
00:46:58,675 --> 00:47:00,870
Attention, please!
