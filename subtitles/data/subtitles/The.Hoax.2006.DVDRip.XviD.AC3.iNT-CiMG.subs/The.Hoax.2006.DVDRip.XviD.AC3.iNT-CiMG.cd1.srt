1
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:01,987
Dana?

2
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:04,319
Dana, can you hear me?

3
00:02:05,925 --> 00:02:08,393
Just follow the instructions.
Is that so difficult?

4
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:09,826
No, no, "N"!

5
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:16,969
Harold.

6
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:19,563
It's very becoming. I like that.

7
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:26,170
Guys, there's nothing
I can do, all right?

8
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:28,076
The meeting's gonna be canceled.

9
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:30,081
The building's being evacuated.

10
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:33,016
Top four floors are closed off.
I don't know what's going on.

11
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:36,145
It doesn't matter.
Nobody's supposed to be there.

12
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:39,223
Just follow the instructions.
Is that so difficult?

13
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:42,624
Clifford, it's 2:37
and my interns are stranded.

14
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:44,162
- Where the fuck is he?
- He's coming.

15
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:45,891
- He's coming?
- He's coming.

16
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:51,032
<i>I think we got something.</i>

17
00:02:51,137 --> 00:02:53,128
Oh, my God. Is that him?

18
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:54,297
<i>South side of the building.
Do you see it?</i>

19
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:57,399
- That's him! He's here!
- Oh, my God!

20
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,102
He's landing! Clear the roof!

21
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:01,772
Get your things. Go! Come on!
- Quickly.

22
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:14,123
He keeps his promises.

23
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:22,961
<i>Fake.</i>

24
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,495
<i>- Fake.
- Yes.</i>

25
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,068
<i>Malika, Clifford is the man
who wrote Fake.</i>

26
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:34,203
An excellent book
about the guy, artist...

27
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:35,303
I'm blanking... Who was it?

28
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:36,746
- Art forger.
- The art forger.

29
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:39,545
- Exactly. Elmyr de Hory was his name.
- Okay.

30
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:44,589
He forged Picassos, Matisses,
Modiglianis...

31
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:48,316
The whole theory of forgery as art.
What is art?

32
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:50,191
Very subversive kind of act.

33
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:52,059
The book sold poorly.

34
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:56,264
- Well, it could've done better.
- Let's not talk about that today.

35
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:58,667
Regardless. The new one. Fiction.

36
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:01,171
<i>- Yes.
- Rudnick's Problem.</i>

37
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:06,943
I like it. You're right.

38
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:08,678
- I like it. Malika liked it, too.
Yeah.

39
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:10,339
Yes, I did. I loved it. It was stunning.

40
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,283
It scared the hell out of me, actually,
to tell you the truth.

41
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:15,354
- It's an angry book.
But funny!

42
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:17,286
I mean, I read it,
I thought it was hilarious.

43
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,221
It wasn't angry to me.

44
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:20,451
It was nice to me. It made me laugh.

45
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,222
But anger's important. We need anger.

46
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:25,957
Which I think will help us in Germany.

47
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:29,301
Regardless,
marry us and have our children?

48
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:34,433
<i>Brad Silber at Life is reading it
right now for serialization rights.</i>

49
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,529
Great.

50
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:37,974
Harold McGraw himself
is reading it this weekend.

51
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:39,908
- You're kidding.
- That's just a formality.

52
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:41,947
You have waited, Cliff.

53
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:45,609
You've watched as less talented writers
have bypassed you.

54
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:48,551
But now, justice at last.

55
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:52,682
They're going to push this one hard.
They're going to bet the bank.

56
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:55,590
- Is that a promise?
- You can set your watch by it.

57
00:04:55,828 --> 00:04:57,489
Andrea, I don't have a watch.

58
00:04:57,597 --> 00:04:59,792
Then buy one.
Trust me, you can afford it.

59
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:11,007
Calls unreturned, they don't read you

60
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,044
for six months, they're indifferent.

61
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:17,549
Then overnight... God.
Dick, can you hear me?

62
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:21,017
Dick! Here, try these. They're bigger.

63
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,121
No, they're fine.

64
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:26,089
We're doing a vacation,
a gentleman's celebration kind of thing.

65
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,722
You got harpoons?
The ones that shoot?

66
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:31,126
- Yeah, most of them shoot.
- Good.

67
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:34,629
He looks like a sausage.
All right, I'll take the whole outfit.

68
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:37,464
Set me up as a regular account.
I prefer monthly payments.

69
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:40,801
You're a prick, Robert, you are such
a prick. You played me like a harp.

70
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:43,876
Whitewalls, leather...
Is this guy a salesman?

71
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:46,171
Now, when my accountant comes by
with the check,

72
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:48,543
should he talk to you directly?

73
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:52,706
He should speak to me directly, yeah,
with the check, yeah.

74
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:59,018
Call the police, there's a
beautiful woman in front of my house!

75
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:06,857
What's the matter, pear?

76
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:09,332
You haven't seen
a bestselling author before?

77
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:12,700
- Oh, Cliff.
- Yes.

78
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:14,067
You didn't think I was going to do it,
did you?

79
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:17,631
Stop, Cliff, stop.
Look, they're taking the sofa.

80
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:21,909
Oh, I love that sofa.

81
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:23,095
Hey, guys. How are you doing?

82
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:24,177
Hey, guys. How are you doing?

83
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:26,174
Ah, fuck the sofa.

84
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:28,946
- Close your eyes. Close, close.
- What?

85
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:34,653
- Okay.
- Oh, Cliff.

86
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:35,887
Cliff!

87
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:39,658
There, perfect.
You are a beautiful man.

88
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:42,525
I am sure you would desert me.

89
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:45,331
No, will desert you,
the tense is future active.

90
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:49,397
Don't correct the grammar of it.
You are not this perfect person.

91
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:56,944
Honey, it's finished.
I told you it was finished.

92
00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:58,744
It's finished with her.

93
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:02,116
- Good night.
- Cliff...

94
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:05,756
- Keys to my new car.
- Yeah, got it. Bye, honey.

95
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:06,847
Have fun.

96
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:13,487
Andrea!

97
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,433
Andrea! Hi, isn't this amazing?
Isn't this wild?

98
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:19,698
- Can I talk to you a second?
- Let's talk on Monday, Cliff.

99
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:22,274
No, just for a second.
It's really important. I'd like to...

100
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,502
Look, 30,000 copies is not gonna do it.

101
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,942
A short run like that,
it sends out a message,

102
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:28,013
and it's not a good one.

103
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,844
- We're not publishing the book.
- Exactly, exactly.

104
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,817
With 30,000 copies, it's like
we're not really publishing the book...

105
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,219
<i>Brad Silber at Life magazine hated it.
He called it,</i>

106
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:42,158
"A third-rate Philip Roth knock-off. "
And he told Harold. And it was awful.

107
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:44,126
It just rolled like a snowball.

108
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:48,362
I wanted to tell you on Monday.
I'm sorry.

109
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:52,871
<i>Fine, we'll do The New Yorker.
The New Yorker's better anyway...</i>

110
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:53,996
You're not listening to me, Cliff.

111
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:56,438
McGraw-Hill is not publishing
your book.

112
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:58,908
Book, gone. The bomb has dropped.

113
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:01,008
It's over.

114
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:06,611
Andrea, you said
that this was a formality.

115
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:08,812
Well, apparently, I was mistaken.

116
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:12,220
Look, if you have other ideas,
my door is always open to you.

117
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:47,417
<i>The enemy, very deceitfully,</i>

118
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,825
<i>has taken advantage of the troops...</i>

119
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:54,298
They are potatoes, all of them.
Potato people.

120
00:08:54,934 --> 00:09:00,566
And you are a brilliant, strong man
who will have all his dreams.

121
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:02,805
All of them.

122
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:19,114
You know what I'm getting
for dinner? Swordfish steak.

123
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,523
It sounds good. Sounds enticing.

124
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:24,892
Oh, come on, Cliff. Forget it, forget it.

125
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:28,524
All right. Enough, enough.

126
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:30,727
I want to talk about my friend.

127
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:32,497
Tell me about the children's book
you're working on.

128
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:36,063
<i>Oh, Richard the Lionhearted.
That's going okay.</i>

129
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:38,403
I should be done
by the end of the year.

130
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:41,446
You know, it's a great subject.
War, sodomy.

131
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:44,141
I mean, the war part's great.
Kids love war.

132
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,480
But what do you do with the sodomy?
You know?

133
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,952
You see, I want it to be
historically accurate.

134
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:53,253
And you will make it so
because you are a superb researcher,

135
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:56,217
and a fine writer.

136
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,524
Thank you.

137
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,829
Bumped by this adolescent coffee boy.

138
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:10,067
My lit professor at Cornell
compared me to Hemingway.

139
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:14,446
The middle of my life is at hand.
I don't have a couch.

140
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:16,306
Think about this.

141
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:18,906
Henry Miller was 38 years old,
unpublished.

142
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:21,350
His wife left him for a lesbian.

143
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:26,089
You're kind to tell me that, Dick.

144
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:28,190
You're a very good man.
You're a good friend.

145
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,057
- Need a loan?
- Always.

146
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:33,657
- No, no. I was kidding, Cliff.
- You got a pen, kid?

147
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:36,394
I was kidding.
Your house is going into foreclosure.

148
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:39,835
- I'm post-dating it.
- Stop that. Stop being the hero.

149
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:43,932
- Go to bed.
- I got it, I got it. Walk away. Go.

150
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,407
- I got it.
- All right.

151
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:49,009
- Go to bed.
- I will.

152
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:03,453
Everyone's being relocated
to another hotel.

153
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:06,127
Please stay calm and follow me.

154
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:08,667
- Excuse me. Can you...
Follow me, please!

155
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:10,463
Somebody told me
that Howard Hughes is

00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:12,434
moving into this hotel.

157
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:15,606
What is this? What's going on?

158
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:19,508
It's an executive decision to close
the facility for the weekend, sir.

159
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:22,513
- You're being relocated.
- Executive decision?

160
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:24,606
Howard Hughes
wants the pool to himself,

161
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:26,617
so he's kicking everyone out
at 1:00 a. M?

162
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:28,880
I don't know about that, sir.

163
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:34,526
That's power.

164
00:11:57,149 --> 00:12:02,451
It's a friendship
between Tom Mix and Pancho Villa.

165
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:06,689
Revolution, Mexican revolution.

166
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,191
Men were men.

167
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:12,060
- Friendship and...
- Mr. Clifford?

168
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:16,293
Andrea's running late, so she said
that we should just go ahead

169
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,802
and start the meeting without her.

170
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:22,996
"Mr. Clifford"? Wait a minute.

171
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:26,406
I'm meeting with you?

172
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:41,954
Oh, no. Excuse me.

173
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:45,653
Mr. Clifford...

174
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,200
Excuse me!
Hello, I'm sorry, everybody. Andrea...

175
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:51,667
I'm sorry. I did tell him, but...

176
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,738
Cliff, I'm in the middle
of a conference meeting.

177
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:54,899
Cliff, I'm in the middle
of a conference meeting.

178
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:58,740
Andrea, our personal history demands
that I bring this to you first.

179
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:00,175
Bring what?

180
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:05,977
I'm working on the most important book
of the 20th century.

181
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:09,513
It's unprecedented.
I'm gonna discuss it tomorrow.

182
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,715
I'm gonna present the details
about it tomorrow.

183
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:15,282
- Okay.
- Morning, 9:00 a. m.

184
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:19,122
- Thank you.
- At Nathan's Bowling Alley in Queens.

185
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,495
- Did I ever take you there before?
- Sir?

186
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,795
Okay, yeah, I'm going, I'm going.

187
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:27,938
You'd better be sure, Andrea,
that I don't have anything,

188
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,531
'cause Simon and Schuster is coming.

189
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:35,140
"Of the century"? Couldn't you
have just said "of the decade"?

190
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:36,214
All right, all right.

191
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:39,307
- And why a bowling alley?
- Please, make a contribution here.

192
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:41,716
Just open your mind.
The first thing that comes to your mind.

193
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,789
- Potato famine.
- Too Irish.

194
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:46,551
- A history of agriculture.
- Oh, that's a bestseller.

195
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:49,560
- Shedding new light on World War I.
- What's the new light?

196
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:53,359
Write about Picasso.
Everyone loves Picasso.

197
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:55,092
I don't.
- Charlemagne?

198
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:58,136
Too French.
- History of the Vatican.

199
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,668
I'm dying.
- Give me a clue here.

200
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:04,604
- I'm being self-destructive.
- I gotta call Barbara.

201
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:07,103
I'm burning bridges, Edith.

202
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,679
They never appreciated you there.

203
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:13,684
I need lunch.

204
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:16,053
I'm having a breakdown.

205
00:14:16,722 --> 00:14:19,748
- My gallery show's in three weeks.
- I know.

206
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:23,317
I don't have time
for the drama now, darling.

207
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:27,724
Shit.

208
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:48,411
Dick!

209
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:52,317
Size 7.

210
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:54,492
How?

211
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:57,460
No one knows where he is.
I show up, I've seen him.

212
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,394
I've seen the snowman.

213
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:01,691
<i>I send him my de Hory book.</i>

214
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:03,333
<i>He reads it.</i>

215
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:05,960
<i>It's a positive portrayal
of a very complex man.</i>

216
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:07,868
Oh, my God, I get a response.

217
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:10,771
Correspondence. Sparks fly.
Personal connection.

218
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:12,400
We become best of friends.
What do you think?

219
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,073
- What is it? What's the book?
- Wait, wait.

220
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:38,628
Where's Simon and Schuster, Tolstoy?

221
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:49,611
This is the key to it.

222
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:53,378
Have a strong, continuous line,
keep the pen on the paper.

223
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:54,679
Just like that.

224
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:13,966
All these articles say the same thing.

225
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:16,564
Hughes runs
a billion-dollar network of companies,

226
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:19,337
but he only communicates
with handwritten memos.

227
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:22,505
He doesn't even talk to his top guys.
There's no direct contact anywhere.

228
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:23,911
That's why it's gonna work.

229
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:26,610
Fine. Tell me my dick grew
five inches last night.

230
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:27,913
I'll still use a ruler.

231
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:36,185
Howard Hughes?
Howard Hughes, the billionaire?

232
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:39,696
His exclusive,
authorized autobiography.

233
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:42,198
He wants Cliff to write it with him.

234
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:44,565
And they want us to publish it.

235
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:48,799
Handwriting analysis? Right away.
Can we bring it over right now?

236
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:54,174
"It would not suit me to die without
having stated the truth about my life. "

237
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:55,268
"My life. "

238
00:16:55,381 --> 00:17:00,614
"I therefore authorize Clifford Irving
to act as intermediary

239
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:04,687
"as to any arrangements regarding
the publishing of my memoir. "

240
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:07,520
"It would not suit me to die

241
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:10,754
"without having
certain misconceptions cleared up

242
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:14,427
"and without having stated
the truth about my life. "

243
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:19,064
So,

244
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:22,163
taking you at your word...

245
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:24,000
Yeah.

246
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,304
How does Mr. Hughes propose
we proceed?

247
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:30,648
I...

248
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:34,612
Look, this is all very strange.

249
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,188
I'm just getting
the lay of the land here myself.

250
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:38,415
But what...

251
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:44,562
What I can gather so far
is that he refuses to go outdoors.

252
00:17:45,297 --> 00:17:48,960
He will only initiate,
never accept, phone calls.

253
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,866
Those two particular rumors
seem to be true.

254
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:54,404
But he did say that he would provide

255
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:57,202
handwritten contracts
for legal purposes.

256
00:17:57,876 --> 00:18:00,470
And... Whatever questions you...

257
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:02,539
You know, you give them to me,

258
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:03,945
I'll pass them on
when he makes contact with me.

259
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:07,041
But beyond that,
I don't know what to say, really.

260
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:10,215
Why you, Cliff?

261
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,281
He could have any writer in the world
do this for him.

262
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:15,917
Albert, I have absolutely no idea.

263
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:18,826
This is the strangest thing
that has ever happened to me.

264
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,729
Best guess, he likes me.

265
00:18:23,969 --> 00:18:27,996
<i>So, the matching against the reprinted
letters from Newsweek magazine,</i>

266
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:31,201
Osborn Associates' preliminary opinion

267
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:34,741
is that the handwriting samples
are genuine.

268
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:40,679
- Okay, well, all right...
- Excuse me one second.

269
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,048
Yeah, sure.

270
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:43,143
Yeah?

271
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:54,726
Clifford?
- Yeah?

272
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:59,429
Did you and Howard discuss
how much you both wanted?

273
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:03,872
Because we would like
to make you an offer today.

274
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:11,572
We did. We did. We...

275
00:19:13,385 --> 00:19:15,012
We did discuss it.

276
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,689
Can I weigh in here?
- No.

277
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:32,133
A man walks in, he says something
completely implausible,

278
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:34,705
and for that exact reason,
he is believed.

279
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:37,570
No, it's an Aquarian phenomenon.

280
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:41,134
- Very, very spiritual.
- Lawyers are not spiritual.

281
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:43,447
Presumably, this is gonna make news.

282
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:46,211
Howard Hughes hasn't spoken
to the press in 15 years.

283
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:48,149
What are you so nervous about?

284
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:51,689
- You can't think, Dick. No thinking.
- All I'm saying is, once this gets out,

285
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:54,315
what's gonna stop this guy
from suing our asses off?

286
00:19:54,426 --> 00:19:57,884
Three words. TWA shareholder lawsuit.

287
00:19:59,164 --> 00:20:03,328
Howard has a judgment of
137 million bucks waiting to hit him

288
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:05,096
if he walks into any courtroom.

289
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,263
So the book comes out,
it doesn't matter. He can't sue.

290
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:08,896
He can still say it's a fake.

291
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:11,373
He doesn't say anything
about anything. This guy...

292
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:15,469
He uses ripped-up Kleenex boxes
for slippers and he drinks his own piss.

293
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:18,709
- He's psychotic.
Have you heard of Intertel?

294
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:21,809
He has his own private CIA.
Ruthless advisors.

295
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,184
His advisors don't know anything
about the book

296
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:26,780
because he's too paranoid to tell them.

297
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:30,419
And he'll never come out of hiding
long enough to denounce me

298
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:33,362
because he's a lunatic hermit.

299
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:37,265
And I am the spokesperson
for the lunatic hermit.

300
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:40,202
So the more outrageous I sound,
the more convincing I am.

301
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:42,796
Do you believe this, the perfection?

302
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:47,640
- They offered half a million.
- Half a million dollars?

303
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:50,044
Four-hundred grand for Howard
and a hundred grand for us!

304
00:20:50,148 --> 00:20:52,844
Oh, I thought you meant
just a half a million for us.

305
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:56,250
Schmuck, it's all for us.
There is no Howard Hughes.

306
00:20:56,855 --> 00:20:59,449
- Dick, are you paying attention to me?
- Yeah.

307
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:01,025
The problem is this.

308
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:02,382
It's an oral agreement.

309
00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:04,189
Their lawyers are gonna
jump all over this,

310
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:05,923
which is why
we have to leave right now.

311
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:08,864
We gotta become experts
on this man's life.

312
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:12,835
And if we find dirt and it rings true,
the top guys will shove this deal

313
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,997
right down the lawyers' throats.

314
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:17,208
Cliff,

315
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:21,836
no visits with special friends, right?

316
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:29,383
I'm not going to do anything
to jeopardize what we've rebuilt, okay?

317
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:32,947
You just said to warn you
when you get excited.

318
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:35,783
- You seem excited.
- Well...

319
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,198
I love you.

320
00:21:46,271 --> 00:21:47,670
I love you.

321
00:22:18,804 --> 00:22:21,830
Cliff, Howard Hughes' testimony

322
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:24,431
at the Senate committee hearings
in 1947.

323
00:22:24,876 --> 00:22:28,505
It's got his speech patterns,
his syntax, everything. It's perfect.

324
00:22:33,985 --> 00:22:35,475
Take a picture.

325
00:22:36,788 --> 00:22:39,154
You can't photograph
a government document, it's a felony.

326
00:22:39,257 --> 00:22:41,054
You gonna memorize it?
Take a picture. Take a picture.

327
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:42,990
I'm a researcher, Cliff.
I am not a jewel thief.

328
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:45,086
You own 25 percent of this book.

329
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,825
You want it to be good?
You take a picture.

330
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:57,566
You know, I've always had
a dangerous side.

331
00:22:57,676 --> 00:23:00,144
Barbara has often remarked on it.

332
00:23:00,245 --> 00:23:03,646
But to take down the Library
of Congress. God, the adrenaline.

333
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:06,445
You took a nice picture
of your leg here.

334
00:23:07,152 --> 00:23:08,915
- Or is that your ankle? I can't tell.
- Where?

335
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,385
Right there.

336
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:15,148
- It's my ankle.
- It's all out of focus anyway.

337
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:16,919
- Jesus.
- Want another drink?

338
00:23:17,028 --> 00:23:18,791
- Yeah.
- Yeah, me, too.

339
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:20,759
Oh, fuck.

340
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:36,514
Harold, this book will sell more copies
than the Bible.

341
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:39,649
And our competitors will kill to get it,
and if they can't get it,

342
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:42,686
they will do anything they can
to destroy it.

343
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:47,919
I say we sign this contract immediately,
and institute absolute, total secrecy.

344
00:23:48,026 --> 00:23:50,494
Total. Not even wives can know.

345
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:53,787
Within reason.

346
00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:57,835
From now on,
we refer to Hughes as "Octavio. "

347
00:23:58,837 --> 00:24:01,772
The book is called "Project Octavio. "

348
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:03,601
Get Ralph Graves on the phone.

349
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:04,732
That's the code name.

350
00:24:04,843 --> 00:24:06,811
I want our journalist friends
to weigh in on this

351
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:09,642
before I sign
Mr. Hughes' piece of paper.

352
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:15,480
Look at all this security personnel.

353
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:18,279
This is a secure facility.

354
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:21,086
We need the information
in portable form.

355
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:25,726
Just look comfortable, be buoyant.

356
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:27,822
Hell, they can let anybody in here.

357
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:31,369
- What if I'm a Russian?
- Be a buoyant Russian.

358
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:34,268
Records? What for?

359
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:37,864
You don't know what the hell's going on
with your own company?

360
00:24:39,544 --> 00:24:43,002
Well, to be honest with you, Sergeant,
no, actually, we don't.

361
00:24:43,381 --> 00:24:45,349
Mr. Hughes doesn't like
to share information.

362
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:47,509
It's very frustrating for us.

363
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:48,502
You want frustration?

364
00:24:48,537 --> 00:24:49,385
You want frustration?

365
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:53,322
Call Hughes Aircraft and try to find out
when your plane's gonna be ready.

366
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:56,724
I've seen decorated individuals
sobbing like six-year-old girls

367
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:58,887
after dealing with you people.

368
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:01,727
Could my associate
use your facilities, Sergeant?

369
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,095
Could he?

370
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:08,964
- Thank you for that.
- To your left.

371
00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:10,837
I'll level with you.
We've had some problems.

372
00:25:10,942 --> 00:25:12,534
Everyone has told us stories
about delays.

373
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:14,271
Well, I can't get anybody on the phone,
for one thing.

374
00:25:14,379 --> 00:25:16,506
- I had no idea it was this serious.
- It's very serious.

375
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:18,606
- Frustrating.
- Can you go into any more detail?

376
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:19,979
Well, the only details I can tell you

377
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:22,849
is that I've been on the phone
three times today to one girl,

378
00:25:22,954 --> 00:25:24,421
who doesn't know
what she's talking about,

379
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:25,888
can't tell me when
I'm gonna get my airplanes.

380
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:28,459
Which office were you talking to?
Do you mind if I write something down?

381
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,755
- Sure.
- This was the complaint department?

382
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:32,261
- No, acquisitions.
- Acquisitions?

383
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,958
Acquisitions, as far as I know.

384
00:25:35,066 --> 00:25:38,092
My people been dealing with her,
or somebody down there,

385
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:40,433
for the last three months,
trying to get two aircrafts.

386
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:42,200
This is an outrage.

387
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:45,071
An outrage,
the military should be treated that way.

388
00:25:47,612 --> 00:25:49,580
No. No. I'm not doing it.

389
00:25:56,988 --> 00:25:57,977
Hi.

390
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:12,399
Thank you.

391
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:21,138
- Hey, Dick. You all right?
- Yeah.

392
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:22,941
Okay. Keep moving, keep moving.

393
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:25,539
- Just fine, just fine.
- It's palpitations.

394
00:26:25,684 --> 00:26:28,710
It's okay. A little bit more,
a little bit more. Keep moving.

395
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,447
Sit down here. That's good.

396
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:32,920
You all right?

397
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:34,889
You're fine. You're fine.

398
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:36,392
Fight or flight. It's an animal thing.

399
00:26:36,494 --> 00:26:38,894
It's like you're being chased
by a cheetah or something.

400
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:41,090
Okay, okay. I'll be fine.

401
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:49,373
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

402
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:52,602
Look, Noah Dietrich, on the right.

403
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:54,804
Howard Hughes' right-hand man
for over 30 years.

404
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:56,744
Retired to Vegas.
The other guy, I don't know.

405
00:26:56,848 --> 00:26:57,974
Vegas?

406
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:02,947
You know, my guess is this guy,
Dietrich, is going to be really cagey.

407
00:27:04,756 --> 00:27:07,224
Information?
Las Vegas, Nevada, please.

408
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:15,227
<i>Hello?
Mr. Dietrich?</i>

409
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:18,734
<i>- Yeah?
- Yeah, I'm sorry to bother you at home.</i>

410
00:27:18,837 --> 00:27:21,101
<i>My name is Clifford Irving
and I'm writing a book</i>

411
00:27:21,206 --> 00:27:23,299
<i>about the history of aviation.</i>

412
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:26,741
<i>I'd be really grateful if you'd share
some of your expertise with me.</i>

413
00:27:27,012 --> 00:27:28,980
<i>Oh, great. Come on over.</i>

414
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:35,216
You like geranium tea?

415
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:39,620
It helps your bowels. Follow me.

416
00:27:40,258 --> 00:27:41,816
Watch your step.

417
00:27:42,293 --> 00:27:45,194
- Hey, you're a writer.
- Yes, I am.

418
00:27:46,064 --> 00:27:48,157
I should show you something.

419
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:50,962
This is an account
of my years at Tool Co.

420
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:54,836
You know Tool Co?
Howard Hughes' company.

421
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:02,542
Has anyone seen this?

422
00:28:03,048 --> 00:28:05,448
Nobody's seen it. It's sensitive.

423
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:08,118
Listen, I'll come right to the point.

424
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:10,949
I'll give you $500
to clean up the grammar,

425
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:12,990
'cause I'm bad with spelling.

426
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:17,221
Yeah, well, I'd have to read it first.
When can I get it back to you?

427
00:28:17,395 --> 00:28:20,558
No, no, no,
I can't let it out of the house.

428
00:28:20,665 --> 00:28:23,634
Why don't you read it right now,
sitting here?

429
00:28:24,736 --> 00:28:26,431
- Now?
- Now.

430
00:28:28,306 --> 00:28:29,898
Right here? Okay.

431
00:28:33,678 --> 00:28:36,476
Take your time. See you later.
- Thank you.

432
00:28:40,151 --> 00:28:43,552
You know what this is?
Do you understand what this means?

433
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:46,556
- This is exactly... It's gold.
- It's perfect.

434
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:50,056
We have to find a way
to get it out of the house.

435
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:51,761
Copy, we need a copy.

436
00:28:51,863 --> 00:28:54,764
Okay, get up. Stand in front of me.
Come over here.

437
00:28:54,866 --> 00:28:57,232
It's great in the water!
- Keep smiling. What's he doing?

438
00:28:57,335 --> 00:28:59,633
- Oh, yeah.
Tell me if he can see it.

439
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,171
Grab it.

440
00:29:01,272 --> 00:29:04,207
Tell your friend to come in.
The water's beautiful.

441
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:06,971
Copy that and get back here,
right away.

442
00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:35,030
Thank you!

443
00:29:44,048 --> 00:29:46,243
Sit down, sit down. Thank you.

444
00:29:47,152 --> 00:29:49,143
All right? Are you ready?

445
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,552
All right. I'm done.

446
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,483
Sir, honesty is my policy.

447
00:29:56,027 --> 00:29:57,824
This is atrocious. It's not publishable.

448
00:29:57,929 --> 00:30:01,194
It's run-on sentences,
it's mangled verbiage...

449
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:02,823
I'm very sorry.

450
00:30:02,934 --> 00:30:06,426
You benefit and I benefit from honesty.
God bless.

451
00:30:09,073 --> 00:30:12,873
This is badly spelled gossip
from someone absolutely in the know.

452
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:15,445
This is perfect. Perfect! Oh, my...

453
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:18,880
You know what we should
do? Let's give Andrea some good news.

454
00:30:33,898 --> 00:30:36,662
This is amazing.
Everybody hates Howard Hughes.

455
00:30:36,768 --> 00:30:39,328
They call him cheap, everything else.

456
00:30:39,437 --> 00:30:42,167
But, you know, they're in his thrall.
They can't stop talking about him.

457
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:44,070
He's Howard Hughes.
Who the fuck are they?

458
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:46,735
Listen. "He rarely took vacations.

459
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:48,727
"But when he did,
he usually booked a remote hotel

460
00:30:48,762 --> 00:30:50,276
"But when he did,
he usually booked a remote hotel

461
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:53,612
"in the Juchitán mountains
called the Salina Cruz. "

462
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:57,443
- Remote. R-E-M-O-A-T. Vacation...
- I'm going for a walk.

463
00:30:57,622 --> 00:30:59,249
- I'll be back in a little bit.
- Okay.

464
00:31:01,793 --> 00:31:03,124
What is it?

465
00:31:06,598 --> 00:31:09,829
Look, you told me
not to call you ever again, so I didn't.

466
00:31:11,069 --> 00:31:14,527
<i>- I say a lot of stupid things, you know?
- Yeah.</i>

467
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:18,467
It was funny seeing you the other night.

468
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:25,342
I would have given anything
to get this call a year ago.

469
00:31:27,652 --> 00:31:30,314
<i>- It's too late. I...
- Clifford...</i>

470
00:31:30,421 --> 00:31:33,219
<i>- You ran out of time. Sorry.
- Clifford, wait. I need to see you.</i>

471
00:31:33,324 --> 00:31:34,348
Bye.

472
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:55,040
Cliff, listen to this.
This is from the Dietrich manuscript.

473
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:58,841
There's a full transcription here of a
conversation between Howard Hughes

474
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:00,781
<i>and Frank McCullough
from Time magazine.</i>

475
00:32:00,885 --> 00:32:06,152
They mention Intertel, the Mormon guy,
George Gordon Holmes.

476
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:08,689
- It's fantastic.
- Stop, listen to me.

477
00:32:08,793 --> 00:32:12,251
- Nina called from New York last night.
- Oh, here we go.

478
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:17,227
Dick, it took me a year
to make things right with Edith.

479
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:19,303
- Keep an eye on me, will you?
- Keep an eye?

480
00:32:19,404 --> 00:32:21,338
It's my second profession.

481
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,608
- Here you are.
- Thanks.

482
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:32,243
Cliff...

483
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:35,847
I've been talking to Barbara,

484
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:40,084
and she's found some kind of
publishing contract.

485
00:32:40,591 --> 00:32:43,719
And I was wondering
if maybe we could talk about,

486
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:46,227
you know, some kind of credit deal,

487
00:32:46,331 --> 00:32:48,856
or just some more money for me.

488
00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:52,501
You're not happy
with what we talked about?

489
00:32:52,603 --> 00:32:54,867
- No, no, no, it's not that.
- What? What is it?

490
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,497
Well, it's just like...
I sort of feel that, you know...

491
00:32:57,842 --> 00:32:59,810
Don't answer that! Don't...

492
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:02,641
Hello, darling. It's Ms. Tate calling.
We have a bit of a problem.

493
00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:06,740
- Andrea thinks it's just me...
- Hello! Hi, Andrea, this...

494
00:33:07,618 --> 00:33:09,779
- Who is this?
- You can't say her name.

495
00:33:09,887 --> 00:33:12,082
- This is Dick.
- No, no, don't give your name.

496
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:13,657
<i>Dick Suskind.</i>

497
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:15,653
Dick, how do you know my name?

498
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,888
- Don't tell her!
- Cliff mentioned you.

499
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:21,625
What are you doing out there
with Clifford?

500
00:33:23,768 --> 00:33:29,001
- I am the...
- Co-coordinator of...

501
00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:33,476
<i>- I'm the coauthor of Project Octavio.
Excuse me?</i>

502
00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:37,579
<i>- Is Cliff there?
Yes, certainly. He's right here.</i>

503
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:41,083
- Put him on the phone, please.
- I didn't know what else to say.

504
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:43,050
- I heard you talking...
- I know what you're doing.

505
00:33:43,154 --> 00:33:44,644
- I know what you're doing.
- What?

506
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:46,724
I know what you're doing.

507
00:33:46,824 --> 00:33:47,916
Hi, Andrea.

508
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:49,653
Who the hell was that, Clifford?

509
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:52,924
That is my associate.

510
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:54,965
I was intending
to talk to you about him.

511
00:33:55,066 --> 00:33:56,931
He's working with me on this.

512
00:33:57,035 --> 00:34:00,198
All right. You need to be in New York
at 9:00 on Monday morning.

513
00:34:00,304 --> 00:34:02,135
You're meeting with Ralph Graves.

514
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,868
<i>He's the editor-in-chief
of Life magazine.</i>

515
00:34:05,643 --> 00:34:07,304
Yeah, I know who he is.

516
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:10,870
You need to go over all your contacts
with Octavio.

517
00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:15,646
<i>Life knows a lot about him, so get
your memory clear and be specific.</i>

518
00:34:15,753 --> 00:34:18,517
<i>I don't want to lose the deal
over their knee-jerk suspicions.</i>

519
00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:21,353
What do you... Wait, wait, wait.
What do you mean, "lose the deal"?

520
00:34:21,459 --> 00:34:23,017
What suspicions?

521
00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:25,419
Just tell them the truth.

522
00:34:39,444 --> 00:34:43,574
He gave me a prune.
He gave me a prune.

523
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:46,641
Visualize the Mediterranean
or something.

524
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:48,685
You're sweating like an animal.

525
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:50,720
You know, it's pretty nervy
of these publishers

526
00:34:50,822 --> 00:34:52,119
to put us through this inquisition.

527
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:55,750
Well, you can't sit it out now.
You're a coauthor.

528
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:00,391
History.

529
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,499
Quite a responsibility.

530
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:06,627
The second handwriting analysis
told us

531
00:35:06,737 --> 00:35:10,605
your letters from Mr. Hughes
are authentic.

532
00:35:10,842 --> 00:35:13,072
100 percent.
No surprise there.

533
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:16,911
Experts want to provide their employers
with good news.

534
00:35:17,915 --> 00:35:19,542
He gave me a prune.

535
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:23,153
What?

536
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:33,263
Right... In a bag.

537
00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:36,458
He gave me a prune. Howard Hughes.

538
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:40,401
Dick is jumping forward a little bit.
It was a memorable moment for him.

539
00:35:40,505 --> 00:35:44,339
- Anyway, Ralph, how can we help?
- You know, no one likes to be accused.

540
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:47,875
I really don't think anyone's
making accusations here, Dick.

541
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:49,674
Are we going to stand around all day
looking at photographs?

542
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,748
We came here to talk about
Howard Hughes. Let's talk about him.

543
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:53,043
He gave me a prune.

544
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:56,086
Howard Hughes gave me a prune
on the beach at Nassau.

545
00:35:56,721 --> 00:36:00,054
I thought you met Hughes
the first time in Mexico.

546
00:36:04,295 --> 00:36:07,093
Ralph, what happened was this.
I got a phone call.

547
00:36:07,198 --> 00:36:08,790
Really, out of the blue.

548
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:12,336
From a man
named George Gordon Holmes.

549
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:14,630
Longtime associate of Howard Hughes.

550
00:36:14,906 --> 00:36:17,568
He says he wants us
to fly down to Mexico City,

551
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:21,043
wait for a call,
so we go ahead and do this.

552
00:36:21,145 --> 00:36:24,546
We fly down there,
we check into this fleabag hotel.

553
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:27,384
<i>Eighteen hours we wait,
no air conditioning,</i>

554
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:30,579
<i>sand crabs in the bathtub,
I say, "The hell with him,"</i>

555
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:32,383
when we spot an envelope,

556
00:36:34,392 --> 00:36:35,620
<i>shoved under the door.</i>

557
00:36:35,726 --> 00:36:37,125
<i>He rarely went on vacation,
but when he did,</i>

558
00:36:37,228 --> 00:36:38,661
<i>he usually booked into a remote hotel</i>

559
00:36:38,763 --> 00:36:40,863
<i>- in the mountains of Juchitán.
It says,</i>

560
00:36:40,898 --> 00:36:41,125
<i>- in the mountains of Juchitán.
It says,</i>

561
00:36:41,232 --> 00:36:44,099
"There's a pilot waiting
to take you to Juchitán. "

562
00:36:46,437 --> 00:36:51,136
<i>So it's 6:00 a. m.,
we're flying low over the mountains,</i>

563
00:36:51,442 --> 00:36:52,670
<i>and I'm nervous.</i>

564
00:36:52,777 --> 00:36:54,574
But he's got a touch, this bush pilot.

565
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:58,376
He brings it right down
onto a gray pebble landing strip.

566
00:36:58,482 --> 00:37:00,211
Just as it comes down,
I see out of the corner of my eye,

567
00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:03,253
there's a jeep that's coming down
from the mountains.

568
00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:05,280
<i>Mexican military?</i>

569
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,350
<i>No.</i>

570
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:09,215
<i>It's Holmes.</i>

571
00:37:09,327 --> 00:37:13,320
- Mr. Irving?
- Yes, that's right. Mr. Holmes?

572
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:15,431
- Who is this?
- Dick Suskind, sir.

573
00:37:15,533 --> 00:37:17,728
<i>So, he's a little surprised to see Dick,</i>

574
00:37:17,835 --> 00:37:20,201
<i>but I explained that Dick
was my researcher and friend,</i>

575
00:37:20,304 --> 00:37:22,602
and that's why he was there
and I couldn't do without him.

576
00:37:22,707 --> 00:37:23,765
We get in the jeep,

577
00:37:23,874 --> 00:37:27,310
<i>and he takes us on this endless ride,
up through the mountains.</i>

578
00:37:27,945 --> 00:37:31,540
We circled around the top of this hill
and we got to the hotel,

579
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,474
which was called

580
00:37:34,352 --> 00:37:35,751
<i>Salina Cruz.</i>

581
00:37:38,322 --> 00:37:40,620
<i>Holmes motions for us to follow.</i>

582
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:44,652
<i>It's quiet.</i>

583
00:37:49,734 --> 00:37:52,703
<i>There's a room
way in the back, like a hut.</i>

584
00:37:54,305 --> 00:37:56,535
<i>Doesn't even have
a view of the ocean.</i>

585
00:38:00,478 --> 00:38:01,911
<i>We can barely see.</i>

586
00:38:04,148 --> 00:38:09,916
<i>There's a little slip of a man on a bed,
sitting like a monk.</i>

587
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,649
<i>Howard Hughes.</i>

588
00:38:20,398 --> 00:38:21,956
Howard Hughes.

589
00:38:22,933 --> 00:38:25,163
Howard Hughes is sitting right there.

590
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:29,405
My heart...

591
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:37,073
<i>And then he was reaching out
through the mosquito netting,</i>

592
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:40,879
and he offered Dick a...

593
00:38:42,253 --> 00:38:43,447
A prune.

594
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:45,082
A prune.

595
00:38:47,758 --> 00:38:49,225
<i>Dick takes the prune,</i>

596
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,335
<i>eats the prune...</i>

597
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:04,500
<i>Not bad.</i>

598
00:39:06,477 --> 00:39:10,470
And he started talking about
the extraordinary value of Mexican soil,

599
00:39:10,581 --> 00:39:12,446
organic farming, organic food,
et cetera, et cetera.

600
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:15,075
The two of them started jabbering
like old friends.

601
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:19,282
We ended up talking a little bit about
business, then Dick and I went home.

602
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:23,219
- I'm a little hungry.
- Let's eat.

603
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:27,858
Ralph, will you pick
something fabulous?

604
00:39:28,766 --> 00:39:30,734
The Latour please, '61.

605
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:33,599
- That'll get us started. Thank you.
- Oh, yes.

606
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:35,695
And some beluga,
shall we, gentlemen?

607
00:39:35,806 --> 00:39:37,068
Sounds good.

608
00:39:38,342 --> 00:39:41,038
You know, Howard Hughes
doesn't like caviar.

609
00:39:41,145 --> 00:39:42,134
Really?

610
00:39:42,246 --> 00:39:45,306
Really. In fact, he made a special point
of saying so.

611
00:39:45,516 --> 00:39:46,983
I remember that. I...

612
00:39:47,084 --> 00:39:48,779
It was such a non sequitur.
It was a strange thing.

613
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:52,686
It was just after Clifford
finished talking about the...

614
00:39:54,325 --> 00:39:55,815
- The crash.
- That's right. The crash.

615
00:39:55,926 --> 00:39:58,554
The one in Beverly Hills.
He nearly hit the top of that house,

616
00:39:58,662 --> 00:40:01,825
parked it right on top of the house, hurt
his back, but he walked away from it.

617
00:40:01,932 --> 00:40:05,129
And he said that people
in Beverly Hills eat caviar,

618
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:08,171
and he doesn't like it
and then he crashed his plane.

619
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:15,744
Okay, then let's make it
two beluga appetizers, please.

620
00:40:15,846 --> 00:40:19,873
- Three maybe.
- Three, yeah. Make it three.

621
00:40:19,984 --> 00:40:22,214
- Andrea, yeah?
- Thank you. Okay. Good.

622
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:27,521
Did you get any sense
of his business acumen?

623
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:29,450
Go ahead.

624
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,926
It's interesting. He said that...

625
00:40:32,696 --> 00:40:37,258
Very interesting. He said that people
often think of business as business,

626
00:40:37,368 --> 00:40:40,701
which of course it is, but also...
Within business, there is also pleasure.

627
00:40:40,805 --> 00:40:43,069
You know, business is pleasure.
Pleasure can be a business.

628
00:40:43,174 --> 00:40:46,610
Business has pleasure.
It's both. It's both at the same time.

629
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:50,012
I didn't really understand it,
but after a while it sunk in,

630
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:54,710
and I realized, you know,
that's his genius.

631
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:07,355
This is your check for writing services.

632
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:11,196
The second check for Mr. Hughes,
or, Octavio, sorry...

633
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:14,100
It's gonna take
a little longer to process.

634
00:41:14,205 --> 00:41:17,504
I understand you're authorized
to receive Mr. Hughes' payment?

635
00:41:17,608 --> 00:41:20,805
Yeah, I am, I am, thank you.
But don't take too long, all right?

636
00:41:20,911 --> 00:41:23,971
<i>Life magazine is prepared
to offer $250,000</i>

to serialize the Howard Hughes story.

638
00:41:31,622 --> 00:41:33,556
That's a record, Harold.

639
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:39,120
I'm wondering if it's enough of a record,
Ralph.

640
00:41:43,234 --> 00:41:44,861
Oh, jeez.
The money makes this real.

641
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:48,504
You can still back out,
but you gotta tell me now.

642
00:41:48,606 --> 00:41:49,595
- Back out?
- Yeah.

643
00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:52,232
Fuck, no!
We're the goddamn Musketeers.

644
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:54,868
Good. That's good.
Don't spend any money, though.

645
00:41:54,979 --> 00:41:56,776
Better we keep it for later,
in case we need it.

646
00:41:56,881 --> 00:41:57,848
Absolutely.

647

We gotta reach big.

653
00:42:14,265 --> 00:42:17,257
We'll go for texture, gritty details,

You want to critique a sitting president
who's also a war criminal?

656
00:42:23,307 --> 00:42:24,467
- No, no, no.
- You can do anything you want.

657
00:42:24,575 --> 00:42:26,566
You can impact culture
with something like this.

658
00:42:26,677 --> 00:42:28,668
"Lmpact culture. " I want to make

You know,
we've got to make this plausible.

660
00:42:30,648 --> 00:42:33,048
Dick, I handed them
three yellow letters.

661
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:36,142
They gave me $500,000.
Is that plausible?

662
00:42:36,253 --> 00:42:37,845
I don't think so.

663
00:42:41,992 --> 00:42:43,391
- You want to get a drink?
- Okay.

664
00:42:43,494 --> 00:42:45,962
I'm gonna change my shirt.
I'll be right out.

665
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:50,264
- I'm heading home.
- You go. I'm sticking for a while.

666
00:42:51,268 --> 00:42:53,259
- See you, Tom.
- Good night.

667
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:16,351
- Tommy, can I use your phone?
- Yeah, sure, go right ahead.

668
00:43:20,531 --> 00:43:22,795
I saw Elmyr a few months ago in Ibiza.

669
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,625
So, how is our old friend Elmyr?

670
00:43:26,036 --> 00:43:27,901
Well, I was having dinner with friends,

671
00:43:28,005 --> 00:43:30,803
and he was at the bar,
sitting all alone, drinking.

672
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:32,337
He came up to me and he said,

673
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:36,812
"I have always found your affair with
Clifford to be common and immoral. "

674
00:43:36,914 --> 00:43:38,438
And he stormed out.

675
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:42,148
You're lying. Elmyr didn't say that.

676
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:43,465
Oh, I'm the liar?

677
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:44,310
Oh, I'm the liar?

678
00:43:44,421 --> 00:43:48,482
And who's writing a fake book about
the most famous man in the world?

679
00:43:51,195 --> 00:43:52,719
Gotta get back.

680
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:56,490
No! No, the clock is broken. You stay.

681
00:43:59,069 --> 00:44:00,730
Just to confirm,

682
00:44:01,171 --> 00:44:04,106
he's still rich
and you're still not gonna leave him.

683
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:06,906
Oh, I want to, Cliff, I want to.

684
00:44:07,444 --> 00:44:10,572
But, no, I'm not going to.

685
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:17,014
I'm shallow, Cliff.

686
00:44:18,856 --> 00:44:22,314
My greatest desire
is to be an American movie star.

687
00:44:22,926 --> 00:44:25,190
- How shallow is that?
- Pretty shallow.

688
00:44:26,463 --> 00:44:29,762
And besides, why does it bother you
so much that I'm your mistress?

689
00:44:29,867 --> 00:44:32,427
Brecht, Hemingway,
they all had mistresses.

690
00:44:32,536 --> 00:44:36,233
The lying gives me a headache,
if you want to know the truth.

691
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:38,771
Oh, I forgot. You're a devoted husband.

692
00:44:39,043 --> 00:44:41,910
I think I forgot
while you were screwing me.

693
00:44:45,449 --> 00:44:46,677
Sorry.

694
00:44:48,485 --> 00:44:51,045
Sorry.
I know I should have not called you.

695
00:44:51,155 --> 00:44:53,851
I'm not gonna go through
this whole thing again.

696
00:44:54,925 --> 00:44:57,894
I can't do it to her. I can't.

697
00:44:59,763 --> 00:45:01,390
I'll see you next time?

698
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:09,837
Oh, Dick, Nina!
There's no future with her.

699
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:12,968
- She weakens me.
- Okay, all right. That's very helpful.

700
00:45:13,077 --> 00:45:15,568
Edith is stability, Dick. She's my rock.

701
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:17,772
Give me a break, will you, please?

702
00:45:18,248 --> 00:45:20,307
Did you tell Nina about the book?

703
00:45:22,019 --> 00:45:23,452
Are you out of your fucking mind?

704
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:26,250
I've got the "I'm an asshole" part
down pretty good.

705
00:45:26,356 --> 00:45:28,654
It's the "What do I do now?" part
I need help with.

706
00:45:28,759 --> 00:45:30,784
Please? Be my friend?

707
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:32,987
- Are you my friend?
- Yeah, I'm your friend.

708
00:45:33,097 --> 00:45:36,658
I don't know what I'm gonna do
if she asks me where I went.

709
00:45:37,101 --> 00:45:38,432
Come clean.

710
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:41,861
She'll leave me, for good.

711
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:45,434
It's the best I got.
What else can I tell you?

712
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:48,544
You wanna hear this?

713
00:45:49,813 --> 00:45:50,780
Yeah.

714
00:45:50,881 --> 00:45:53,441
All right,
this is the Senate hearings, 1947.

715
00:45:53,784 --> 00:45:56,753
<i>I'm not even sure
that's a correct statement,</i>

716
00:45:56,854 --> 00:46:01,450
<i>but the fact remains
that if I made 15 million dollars,</i>

717
00:46:01,558 --> 00:46:05,050
<i>I made it selling oil well tools
and beer,</i>

718
00:46:05,162 --> 00:46:08,256
<i>Grand Prize beer,
to people down in Texas.</i>

719
00:46:08,365 --> 00:46:10,128
"Beer down in Texas. "

720
00:46:11,502 --> 00:46:15,495
<i>And I don't think the public
should be led to believe...</i>

721
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:17,335
"Led to believe. "

722
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:20,604
<i>...on war contracts while I did not.
Now, furthermore...</i>

723
00:46:20,711 --> 00:46:22,542
"Now, furthermore... "

724
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:24,943
- "Furthermore, Senator... "
- "Furthermore... "

725
00:46:25,048 --> 00:46:28,245
<i>...a little money somewhere.
How could I put nine million dollars...</i>

726
00:46:28,352 --> 00:46:29,876
A little pocket change

727
00:46:29,987 --> 00:46:33,115
worth five million dollars in my pocket.

728
00:46:35,592 --> 00:46:37,560
Mr. Hughes, where would you
like to begin?

729
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:42,455
- Family, friends, father...
- Yeah.

730
00:46:42,566 --> 00:46:44,431
My father. We'll do father.

731
00:46:49,406 --> 00:46:53,467
People called my father Big Howard.

732
00:46:55,279 --> 00:46:56,541
Big Howard...

733
00:46:57,414 --> 00:47:02,249
Big Howard made his money
leasing drilling bits in the oil business.

734
00:47:04,721 --> 00:47:06,985
He said to me... He said, "Sonny... "

735
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:12,761
"Sonny, these drill bits
are your bread and butter.

736
00:47:12,863 --> 00:47:14,694
"Don't ever let 'em go. "

737
00:47:17,868 --> 00:47:22,100
Big Howard died when I was 18.

738
00:47:25,075 --> 00:47:30,775
His bunch of Texas roughneck friends
tried to sell his company.

739
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:36,244
Pushed me out of the picture.
I don't like being pushed.

740
00:47:38,155 --> 00:47:44,060
Now, when two parties negotiate,
you got a lion and a donkey.

741
00:47:47,664 --> 00:47:51,361
One party, through bluster or leverage,

742
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:56,362
claims control of
the situation right away. That's the lion.

743
00:47:58,508 --> 00:47:59,907
At 18,

744
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:03,243
I sued these men
trying to sell my father's company.

745
00:48:03,347 --> 00:48:05,872
I sued them, I attacked them,
I blackmailed them,

746
00:48:05,983 --> 00:48:09,612
I pushed every which way I could!

747
00:48:11,688 --> 00:48:13,553
I learned to be a lion.

748
00:48:28,205 --> 00:48:29,638
Jesus, Cliff.

749
00:48:39,149 --> 00:48:41,549
- Read the women's rags lately?
- Hi.

750
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:45,220
Excerpts from
Howard Hughes' autobiography

751
00:48:45,322 --> 00:48:49,019
<i>in Ladies Home Journal
from the book by Robert Eaton.</i>

752
00:48:51,295 --> 00:48:53,957
<i>Life's lawyers are gnawing
the flesh from my bones.</i>

753
00:48:54,064 --> 00:48:55,578
Would you like to tell me, Clifford,
what the fuck is going on here?

754
00:48:55,613 --> 00:48:57,092
Would you like to tell me, Clifford,
what the fuck is going on here?

755
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,462
I don't know anything about this.

756
00:48:58,568 --> 00:49:00,593
This goddamn Eaton
supposedly has memos,

757
00:49:00,704 --> 00:49:03,867
the same handwritten memos
that you've got, so...

758
00:49:04,341 --> 00:49:07,276
Either you're selling this twice and
using Robert Eaton as a pen name...

759
00:49:07,377 --> 00:49:09,504
I won't even dignify that
with a response.

760
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:15,108
Or, more likely, your demigod
lunatic friend is using two writers.

761
00:49:15,218 --> 00:49:16,276
You get it?

762
00:49:16,386 --> 00:49:18,445
All the sharks at my company
have is you,

763
00:49:18,555 --> 00:49:23,288
which means they will sue your skinny
ass for every cent of the advance,

764
00:49:23,393 --> 00:49:26,055
plus damages,
for making false representations...

765
00:49:26,163 --> 00:49:27,425
No, I made no false representations!

766
00:49:27,531 --> 00:49:30,500
...about an exclusive book
you said you could deliver.

767
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:33,296
So she said that they said
that they would sue us both?

768
00:49:33,403 --> 00:49:34,427
- Yeah.
- Both of us?

769
00:49:34,538 --> 00:49:36,597
- I mean, she mentioned me by name?
- Yes.

770
00:49:36,707 --> 00:49:38,902
Can you believe this son of a bitch
had the same idea?

771
00:49:39,009 --> 00:49:40,806
But I spent the money.

772
00:49:41,345 --> 00:49:44,371
I told you we might have to give it back!
Jeez, Dick.

773
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:46,813
Well, it wasn't exactly
a huge percentage to begin with.

774
00:49:46,917 --> 00:49:48,111
Look, just pay the money.

775
00:49:48,218 --> 00:49:51,210
Tell them that Hughes
has changed his mind.

776
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:55,052
- And I'll owe you the difference.
- I can't. I'm down most of it myself.

777
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:58,559
Yeah, well, borrow it.
This isn't a prank anymore, Cliff.

778
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:00,527
If they go to the press with this,

779
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:02,962
we're gonna have
Howard fucking Hughes chasing us.

780
00:50:03,066 --> 00:50:04,260
And Intertel.

781
00:50:04,368 --> 00:50:07,166
Remember, they'll stab us
with sodium pentothal?

782
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:10,967
They'll kill us or tie us up or something.

783
00:50:11,308 --> 00:50:15,335
Howard won't be coming after us.
His advisors maybe, but he won't.

784
00:50:15,445 --> 00:50:16,503
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

785
00:50:16,613 --> 00:50:18,137
- What, he tell you that over breakfast?
- Yeah.

786
00:50:18,248 --> 00:50:20,375
And what about this other book?
What if that's the real thing, huh?

787
00:50:20,484 --> 00:50:22,076
You thought about that?

788
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:23,645
All right, the question is,

789
00:50:23,754 --> 00:50:25,881
what would Howard do
in a situation like this?

790
00:50:25,989 --> 00:50:28,150
I don't know. Buy a fucking airline.

791
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:33,788
Diversion, end run, surprise.

792
00:50:35,966 --> 00:50:37,957
Who are you now? General Patton?

793
00:50:38,402 --> 00:50:41,997
<i>Viruses and bacteria
are the most powerful enemies...</i>

794
00:50:46,676 --> 00:50:47,904
Luce.

795
00:50:49,279 --> 00:50:52,009
<i>...the human body has got.
You look at the fingernail clippings...</i>

796
00:50:52,115 --> 00:50:53,844
Henry Luce.

797
00:50:57,187 --> 00:50:59,815
Dick, I think you should
take a little holiday.

798
00:51:00,323 --> 00:51:01,881
<i>You got everything?
You got your passport?</i>

799
00:51:01,992 --> 00:51:03,391
- You got the letter? Okay, great.
- Yeah, I'm fine...

800
00:51:03,493 --> 00:51:05,051
You're gonna be fine. Bye.

801
00:51:39,362 --> 00:51:41,421
<i>- Hello, this is Andrea.
- Yeah, Andrea, it's Cliff.</i>

802
00:51:41,531 --> 00:51:43,761
<i>Yeah, one more thing, Shelton Fisher
needs to be at the meeting.</i>

803
00:51:43,867 --> 00:51:45,095
<i>Do you know who he is?</i>

804
00:51:45,202 --> 00:51:46,863
<i>Chairman of McGraw-Hill, yes.</i>

805
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:49,234
<i>- Has to be at the meeting.
- All right, I'll see what I can do.</i>

806
00:51:49,339 --> 00:51:53,275
<i>It's not me. It's him.
No negotiation. No Fisher, no meeting.</i>

807
00:52:04,354 --> 00:52:08,415
Mr. Irving, it would appear
that either you

808
00:52:08,525 --> 00:52:12,291
or your illustrious sponsor
is jerking someone's chain.

809
00:52:12,762 --> 00:52:16,459
<i>Let me assure you that chain
will not be connected to Life magazine.</i>

810
00:52:17,667 --> 00:52:22,070
So, why don't you begin by telling us
who Robert Eaton is

811
00:52:22,172 --> 00:52:25,733
and why he's selling the book
you're supposed to be writing?

812
00:52:28,245 --> 00:52:30,713
Shelton, have you received
your mail today?

813
00:52:33,083 --> 00:52:34,380
Excuse me?

814
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:37,143
Ralph, I was talking to Shelton.

815
00:52:37,454 --> 00:52:39,854
As a side comment,
watch your tone with me.

816
00:52:39,956 --> 00:52:43,414
I've been up for two nights negotiating
with a very stubborn billionaire,

817
00:52:43,527 --> 00:52:46,189
and my quota for verbal abuse
has been reached.

818
00:52:49,866 --> 00:52:51,834
Could you get the mail, please?

819
00:52:52,536 --> 00:52:54,902
<i>Life magazine has been known</i>

820
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:58,338
to have a slight impact
on writers' careers, my friend.

821
00:52:58,441 --> 00:53:02,172
And we...
We are not afraid of civil litigation.

822
00:53:02,412 --> 00:53:05,677
That's the tone, right there.
You got that? Watch it.

823
00:53:16,626 --> 00:53:18,025
Is that it?

824
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:20,693
All right, Shelton,
while you're reading this,

825
00:53:20,797 --> 00:53:23,527
assuming that Howard wrote
what he told me he was gonna write,

826
00:53:23,633 --> 00:53:25,999
I will give a summary to the group here.

827
00:53:26,102 --> 00:53:30,095
Howard doesn't know who Eaton is.
The book is a fake.

828
00:53:31,074 --> 00:53:32,405
But that doesn't really matter now

829
00:53:32,509 --> 00:53:35,307
because when he found out
that McGraw-Hill sold

830
00:53:35,412 --> 00:53:39,542
<i>the serialization rights to Life magazine
without his authorization,</i>

831
00:53:40,183 --> 00:53:44,483
he became...
What's the word? Apoplectic.

832
00:53:46,756 --> 00:53:48,747
You got a problem, Ralph.

833
00:53:48,858 --> 00:53:51,986
Your magazine is owned
by Henry Luce.

834
00:53:52,529 --> 00:53:54,724
What's the matter with Henry Luce?

835
00:53:54,831 --> 00:53:56,594
According to Howard?

836
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:59,328
Well, Luce is in bed with Juan Trippe
at Pan Am.

837
00:53:59,436 --> 00:54:02,837
He's a goddamn socialist
and he's a lousy golfer.

838
00:54:02,939 --> 00:54:04,839
It's just... It's a rant.

839
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:09,469
It's basically a three-page rant
about what a bastard Luce is.

840
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:12,912
That's Howard's words, it's not mine.
I don't have a problem with Luce at all.

841
00:54:13,016 --> 00:54:16,076
And the postmark is Nassau.

842
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:18,910
That is completely irrelevant.

843
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:22,584
And we are talking about
a business agreement

844
00:54:22,692 --> 00:54:24,455
that will hold up in a court of law.

845
00:54:24,561 --> 00:54:28,395
We had a business agreement.
Not anymore.

846
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:35,260
I pleaded with him to reconsider,
but I was unsuccessful, so...

847
00:54:38,408 --> 00:54:44,142
Per Howard's instructions,
I am returning

848
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:48,509
his $ 100,000 advance check to you.

849
00:54:52,422 --> 00:54:54,822
Now, if you want to,
you can chase us around in court.

850
00:54:54,924 --> 00:54:56,448
Meanwhile, we're gonna look
for another publisher.

851
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:57,625
Wait, no, Clifford.

852
00:54:57,660 --> 00:54:58,692
Wait, no, Clifford.

853
00:54:59,362 --> 00:55:02,559
Mr. Irving, we have a contract with you,

854
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:05,324
which means that our company
owns the property.

855
00:55:05,435 --> 00:55:06,561
Wrong.

856
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:12,173
Through all of my pleading, hours of it,
believe me, it could be yours, Shelton.

857
00:55:12,275 --> 00:55:15,574
It could. You could make a public
announcement within the week.

858
00:55:15,679 --> 00:55:17,203
You know, and he's all right, actually,

859
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:19,475
with Ralph still being involved
with this thing,

860
00:55:19,582 --> 00:55:22,949
provided you increase his advance

861
00:55:23,053 --> 00:55:25,544
to one million dollars,
and not a penny less.

862
00:55:27,757 --> 00:55:30,021
What? A million dollars?
- Yes.

863
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:31,949
A million dollars?

864
00:55:32,062 --> 00:55:35,361
Wait, I think we should try
to maintain an atmosphere

865
00:55:35,465 --> 00:55:37,057
of goodwill and trust here.

866
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:38,327
Trust?
- Yeah.

867
00:55:38,435 --> 00:55:41,199
The man's a Texan copperhead.
"Trust. "

868
00:55:42,138 --> 00:55:43,105
Thank you.

869
00:55:43,206 --> 00:55:46,698
Where are you going?
Where are you going? Wait a minute.

870
00:55:46,810 --> 00:55:50,610
Let me tell you something.
That book is mine, signed and sealed!

871
00:55:50,714 --> 00:55:53,444
And I'm not paying any goddamn
million dollars for it.

872
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:54,881
You understand that?

873
00:55:54,984 --> 00:55:56,975
You listen to me,
Mr. Clifford fucking Irving.
