Bonjour.

00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:39,070
What's going on?
What are you doing here?

3
00:00:39,173 --> 00:00:42,574
Well, I was over here, like this,
but that didn't really work for me...

4
00:00:42,676 --> 00:00:44,576
so I thought I'd try over here.

5
00:00:44,678 --> 00:00:47,579
But I don't think there's much
future in this one either.

6
00:00:47,681 --> 00:00:50,741
Fuckin' hell.
Have you got any suggestions?

7
00:00:50,851 --> 00:00:53,581
- Nope.
- So what do you do now?

8
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:57,055
- I'm gonna get some breakfast.
- Yeah, I could do with something to eat.

9
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:59,557
- Can I come with ya?
- Have you got any money?

10
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:02,561
- Nope.
- Well, how are you gonna pay for it?

11
00:01:02,663 --> 00:01:04,563
I'm not.

12
00:01:04,665 --> 00:01:07,691
Well, I'm hungry.

13
00:01:10,271 --> 00:01:13,729
- Did you have to go and beat her up?
- I never beat her up.

14
00:01:15,943 --> 00:01:19,037
- You shagged her though?
- No.

15
00:01:26,954 --> 00:01:28,922
You don't believe me, do you?

16
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:33,955
- She's older than you.
- Bollocks.

17
00:01:34,061 --> 00:01:36,029
Poached egg.

18
00:01:38,065 --> 00:01:41,865
That skirt's a bit short, innit, love?
It's disgraceful.

19
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:53,034
- What's this?
- That's where I'm gonna live.

20
00:01:54,882 --> 00:01:56,850
Where is it?

21
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,918
Ireland.

22
00:01:59,019 --> 00:02:01,419
I've lived in that cottage before.

23
00:02:01,522 --> 00:02:03,490
What, in one of your past lives?

24
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,688
Yes, as a matter of fact.

25
00:02:09,763 --> 00:02:11,731
Fuckin' shit-hole, innit?

26
00:02:16,103 --> 00:02:19,231
- Don't waste your life.
- What?

27
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:22,571
Don't waste your life.

28
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:40,954
- What time does this place close?
- 4:00.

29
00:02:41,028 --> 00:02:44,225
Uh, listen, can you tell me
where I can get something to eat round here?

30
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:46,231
[Laughs]
What?

31
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,233
- You've got a very nice smile.
- Have I?

32
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:49,962
Oh, yeah.

33
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:37,417
Sorry, sir.

34
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:47,360
I'll take that, sir.

35
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:53,199
Your lady companion
is joining you, sir?

36
00:03:55,169 --> 00:03:58,866
Uh, no, she can't make it today, pal.
The old sciatica's playing up and everything.

37
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:01,304
- You know?
- Come on.

38
00:04:02,543 --> 00:04:04,534
What?

39
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:08,514
- Out of the car.
- Well, I've only just got in the car.

40
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:10,378
Get out of the fucking car!

41
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:13,976
[Snickers] All right, Parker.
Keep your hat on.

[Door Closes]

43
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:27,063
Well, that was lovely.
Thank you.

44
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:29,294
Keep in touch.

45
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:55,962
Oh, fuck.

46
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:07,765
- Who are you?
- Sebastian Hawks.

47
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:09,775
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

48
00:05:09,877 --> 00:05:11,777
Um, what you doin' here?

49
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:14,177
- I'm an acquaintance of Sandra's.
- Oh, yeah?

50
00:05:14,281 --> 00:05:18,183
- I just popped round to say hello.
- Well, Sandra's away at the moment, actually.

51
00:05:18,285 --> 00:05:20,185
Really.

52
00:05:20,287 --> 00:05:23,188
I hope you don't mind,
but I helped myself to a beer.

53
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:26,987
Yeah, I noticed.
Is that your champagne and all?

54
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:32,458
- You like champagne, do you?
- Yeah. I do, as it happens.

55
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:34,591
This is a very nice flat.
Don't you think?

56
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:36,862
How did you get in here?

57
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:39,029
Tell me, do you have any problems
with the central heating?

58
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:40,629
Oh, are you the plumber?

59
00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:42,902
Let's just say I've got
a vested interest in the property.

60
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:45,570
Fuckin' hell.
You're the landlord.

61
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:49,376
- I'd rather you thought of me as a friend.
- Oh, shit.

62
00:05:49,483 --> 00:05:52,577
What, is Sandra behind
on the rent or something?

63
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,813
Was your tattoo painful?

64
00:05:54,922 --> 00:05:56,389
Yeah.

65
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,890
Good.

66
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:02,928
You're very beautiful, aren't you?

67
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,555
Am I?

68
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,328
In a quirky sort of way.

69
00:06:11,438 --> 00:06:13,338
- Are you a nurse?
- Yeah.

70

[Snickers, Giggles]

72
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,143
These are a very fetching
pair of tights.

73
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:24,081
Oh, you like them, do ya,
Mr. Landlord?

74
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:27,085
Can we have that champagne
now, please?

75
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:29,781
Did you buy them like this,
or are the holes self-inflicted?

76
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:33,587
Nah. A spider spun them,
and that's where he had a tea break.

77
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:37,591
Fucking hell!
That's a bit excessive, innit?

78
00:06:37,698 --> 00:06:40,599
- I rather like this belt too.
- [Mutters] Oh, God.

79
00:06:40,701 --> 00:06:44,137
Here we go.
[Sighs]

80
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:48,773
- Excuse me. Where do you think you're going?
- I'm going home.

81
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,775
- What, you're leaving me?
- Yeah.

82
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:53,778
I've come all this way to see you,
and you're going. I can't believe it.

83
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,781
- I'm stunned. I'm flabbergasted.
- So we'll get you a tissue.

84
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:59,511
Sounds promising.
Do you live nearby?

85
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:02,783
- I might do.
- I mean, is it within walking distance?

86
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:09,654
No, 'cause, you see, I've got this fascination
with all things peripatetic.

87
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:12,527
- See ya.
- Cheeky, aren't I?

88
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,335
Have you stolen the tea cozy?

89
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:21,100
Love, people can see you wearing that thing.
You're not embarrassed? No?

90

[Panting]

91
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:45,563
Don't give up.

00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,566
Oh! Oww!

[Panting, Sobbing]

94
00:07:56,276 --> 00:07:58,176
Put this on.

95

Oh, what?

96
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,680
Gonna play doctors and nurses now,
are we?

97
00:08:02,783 --> 00:08:05,411
Hurry up.

98

Oh, this is ridiculous.

Listen, I'm really sorry, right,
but I've had a bit of a rough week...

100
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,225
and I just don't think
I can go through with this.

101

Don't know.

Having a shower, relaxing.

112
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:59,771
I could do with a shower meself.

113
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:03,434
I haven't washed for about a week,
as you've probably noticed.

114

You can have one if you like.

- You sure?
- Yeah.

dressed up as your mother, are you?

No.

00:09:35,542 --> 00:09:38,511
But it looks like you already are
dressed up as your mother.

124
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:54,757
Can I have me bag?
It's got me duck in it.

with their novelty underpants.

Oh, look at this one,
touching time with a barge pole.

00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:56,789
I wouldn't.

00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,120
Is he a Homer-sexual, yeah?

What do you think?

135
00:11:05,565 --> 00:11:08,033
- Where is he?
- They're in America.

- They?
- Yeah.

137
00:11:10,604 --> 00:11:12,936
- When are they gettin' back?
- Don't know.

138
00:11:14,241 --> 00:11:16,368
And they're just letting you
stop here for nothing?

- Yeah?
- Yeah.

- I don't know them.
- I don't know.

- I find all this a bit sad.
- Why?

142
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:28,347
No, I don't mean that
to sound Homer-phobic.

143
00:11:28,455 --> 00:11:30,787
I mean, I like The Iliad.
[Snickers]

No.

No, I haven't.

I bet you do. You've most likely
done it at school. You just can't remember.

[Chuckles]

160
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:22,403
Do you want those beans?

161
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:24,101
Oh, yeah. I forgot.

162
00:12:55,675 --> 00:12:57,575
Sebastian Hawks.

163
00:12:57,677 --> 00:12:59,645
Good evening.

164
00:13:01,014 --> 00:13:03,346
Very nice to meet you, Louise.

165
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,543
Very nice to meet you.

166
00:13:05,652 --> 00:13:07,620
I've heard a lot about you.

167
00:13:13,994 --> 00:13:16,087
- Sophie?
- Yeah?

168
00:13:16,196 --> 00:13:18,096
Yeah, I'm in here.

169
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:21,759
- Oh. You all right?
- I've never been better.

170
00:13:21,868 --> 00:13:24,769
We've had a very interesting afternoon.
Haven't we, Sophie?

171
00:13:24,871 --> 00:13:26,771
[Sophie]
It's been fascinating.

[Jeremy Snickers, Giggles]

173
00:13:40,453 --> 00:13:42,853
For services rendered.

174
00:13:42,956 --> 00:13:45,447
- Fuck off.
- [Giggling Continues]

[Coughing]

176
00:13:48,061 --> 00:13:51,155
- Who's your friend?
- He's the landlord, isn't he?

177
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:53,459
- Whose landlord?
- Our fucking landlord.

178
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:55,864
- Oh, get out of town.
- Ask him.

179
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:01,971
- What you wearin' Sandra's uniform for?
- I don't wanna talk about it. All right?

180
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:05,540
- You want a cup of tea?
- Yeah.

[Water Sloshing]

182
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:13,041
So, have you been sittin' on his face
all afternoon?

183
00:14:13,153 --> 00:14:15,280
- I don't need this.
- Jesus Christ.

184
00:14:15,388 --> 00:14:19,085
I get home from work, all I wanna do
is put my feet up and watch the telly...

185
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:21,217
not get involved
in one of your orgies.

186

Do you know what I mean?

187
00:14:27,434 --> 00:14:29,402
What happened to your arm?

188
00:14:33,173 --> 00:14:35,300
Sophie, what's been going on?

189
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:40,411
- Have you put the kettle on?
- Yeah.

190
00:14:40,513 --> 00:14:43,004
Any chance of a coffee, Louise?

191
00:14:43,116 --> 00:14:45,084
Yeah. Sure.

192
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:50,483
- These are a very nice pair of shorts.
- Would you take your hands off me, please?

193
00:14:51,524 --> 00:14:53,424
I apologize.

194
00:14:56,863 --> 00:15:00,060
Right, pal. Here's your clothes.
Get your kit on and sling your hook.

195
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:02,430
Here's your shoes, mate.

196
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:07,802
Hope I haven't given you Al DS, Sophie.

197
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,705
- Jesus Christ!
- Fucking hell! Are you serious?

198
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:13,803
- Merely jesting.
- Very funny.

199
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,381
Mind you, I think Al DS
is rather healthy, in its way.

200
00:15:16,483 --> 00:15:19,611
- You what?
- I realize that's not the fashionable thing to say.

201
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:22,654
- No, it's not.
- But the world is overcrowded, isn't it?

202
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,519
- Could do with a bit of pruning.
- You fucking better be joking.

203
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,820
You're not going to have children,
are you, Louise?

204
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,827
I might do one day.

205
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,988
I loathe children, I must say.

206
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:35,067
- I bet they're not too keen on you neither.

I'm sure you like fucking.
Don't you, Louise?

208
00:15:38,138 --> 00:15:40,368
- Are you going?
- I'm rather enjoying myself, actually.

209
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:42,532
- Yeah, well, we're not.
- That's a pity.

210
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:47,045
You may be the landlord from hell, but that
doesn't give you the right to lie on our couch.

211
00:15:48,214 --> 00:15:50,842
- Whose couch?
- Do you want me to phone the police?

212

Be my guest.

213

Right.

- Listen, I can't have them in here.
- Why not?

215
00:16:02,929 --> 00:16:06,865
They're gonna look at him in his suit, look at
us, and who do you think they're gonna believe?

There's fucking dope
all over the place.

Well, we're just winding him up.
He's loving this.

218
00:16:11,871 --> 00:16:13,839
What are we gonna do?

219
00:16:18,878 --> 00:16:20,846
It's very peaceful here, innit?

00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:24,316
Suppose so.

00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,179
Are you warm enough?

222
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:31,257
Yeah, it's nice. Thanks.

223
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,928
It's funny, 'cause the silence
usually freaks me out.

224
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:40,194
You start to pick up on all the small sounds.
You know what I mean?

225
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,632
- Like that clock.
- [Ticking]

226
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:47,698
I hate that fucking clock.

227

Course you do.
It's a clock.

Is it all right
if I stay here tonight?

229
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:00,085
Have you ever had a dog?

230
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:05,183
No.

231
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:10,587
- I don't like dogs.
- Why?

232
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:13,063
Well, they're either vicious or daft.

233
00:17:13,967 --> 00:17:15,935
- Why? Have you?
- Yeah.

234
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:19,494
- Is it dead now?
- Yeah.

235
00:17:19,606 --> 00:17:21,506
Did you bury it?

236
00:17:21,608 --> 00:17:23,872
Don't know.
Me dad took it.

237
00:17:26,112 --> 00:17:28,945
And what about you?
Would you like to be buried or cremated?

238
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,016
I couldn't give a shit.

00:17:33,286 --> 00:17:35,754
[Chuckles]

240
00:17:35,855 --> 00:17:41,122
I had this, uh, dream the other night
about these two skeletons havin'a fuck.

241
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:43,991
Was a right bloody racket.
Woke me up.

242
00:17:44,097 --> 00:17:45,997
Have you got a photo of your mum?

[Snickers, Laughing]

244
00:17:50,937 --> 00:17:53,167

[Laughs]

246
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:57,106
No.

247
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:00,179
I think you might find one
over at the news agent's, on the top shelf.

248
00:18:01,881 --> 00:18:03,849
Do you want some beans?

249
00:18:12,492 --> 00:18:14,392
You've got a very sad face.

250
00:18:14,494 --> 00:18:16,894
Have I?

251
00:18:16,996 --> 00:18:20,056
It's all right.
I mean, I find that attractive.

252
00:18:22,068 --> 00:18:24,127
But that's me.

253
00:18:24,237 --> 00:18:26,137
[Exhales]

254
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:29,208
So, have you got a boyfriend
or anything?

255
00:18:33,346 --> 00:18:36,713
[Sniffles, Sighs]

256
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,087
What are you gonna do for Christmas?

257
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:46,191
I don't know.
What are you gonna do?

258
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:51,296
- You all right?
- [Whimpers]

259
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:56,226
- What's the matter?
- [Sobbing] Fuck off!

00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,498
What's up, love?

263
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:31,264
- Is it something I said?
- I want you to go.

264
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:34,169
- Why?
- Can you go, please?

265
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:38,405
- Is it 'cause I don't like dogs?
- Get out!

266
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:42,481
- Don't quite follow, love.
- Just fuck off!

267
00:19:42,582 --> 00:19:45,312
Oh. I see.

268
00:19:45,418 --> 00:19:47,648
Um -
[Sighs]

269
00:19:47,754 --> 00:19:49,779
Well, perhaps I was
jumping to conclusions...

270
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:52,790
but I got the impression that I could
kip down on the sofa or something.

271
00:19:52,892 --> 00:19:55,417
- Go!
- Go where?

272
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:58,429
Have you got any suggestions?
'Cause it's like a fucking Eskimo's grave out there.

Hey! Hey!

00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,595
All right, I'm going!

275
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,966
Hey!

276
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,213
It's not easy, is it?

277
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:01,393
Do you find that?

278
00:21:08,301 --> 00:21:10,633
[Chuckles]
Well...

279
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:12,636
just goes to show ya...

280
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:15,536
that no matter
how many books you read...

281
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:18,974
there's some things in this world
that you never, ever, ever, ever...

282
00:21:19,078 --> 00:21:22,707
ever fuckin' understand.

283
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:45,627
Oh, thank you for the tea
and the bath and the booze.

284
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:49,374
And the beans.

285
00:21:56,182 --> 00:22:01,245
And listen, love, I hope that when
you're tucked up tonight all snug and warm...

286
00:22:01,354 --> 00:22:03,720
underneath your
tear-sodden fuckin' duvet...

287
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:05,757
and your ankle-length
Emily Brontë winding sheet...

288
00:22:05,858 --> 00:22:09,419
that you spare a thought for me
with me head in a puddle of cold dog's piss.

289
00:22:09,529 --> 00:22:13,898
And I hope that you dream about me.
And I hope that you wake up screamin'.

290
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:18,402
And I hope that
all your fuckin' children...

291
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:21,940
are born blind, bow-legged,
hare-lipped, homeless hunchbacks!

292
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:39,190
Have you ever had an abortion?

293
00:22:40,393 --> 00:22:42,293
- Have you?
- No.

294
00:22:42,395 --> 00:22:45,626
- I thought I was pregnant once.
- Would you have had one?

295
00:22:45,731 --> 00:22:49,360
In the end, it turned out I wasn't,
and he left me anyway, so -

296
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:52,470
I wanted to keep mine.

297
00:22:52,572 --> 00:22:54,472
What happened?

298
00:22:54,574 --> 00:22:57,975
All my mates said
I couldn't look after a baby.

299
00:22:58,077 --> 00:22:59,977
Too fucking right.

300
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:02,639
Did it make you feel shitty?

301
00:23:02,748 --> 00:23:04,978
It was a nightmare.

302
00:23:05,084 --> 00:23:07,245
I really loved 'im.

303
00:23:08,788 --> 00:23:11,689
- He was a philosopher.
- Where was this?

304
00:23:11,791 --> 00:23:13,691
- Paris.
- Paris?

305
00:23:13,793 --> 00:23:17,092
Should have seen the state
of his girlfriend.

306
00:23:18,831 --> 00:23:21,493
Had one when I was 15 and all.

307
00:23:21,601 --> 00:23:23,592
Jesus, Sophie.

308
00:23:23,703 --> 00:23:28,163
And that one was worse for my mum.
Fucking drama she made out of it.

309
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:34,712
I could have been married by now
with a four-year-old.

310
00:23:34,814 --> 00:23:37,112
Do you wanna get married?

311
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:39,184
Don't know.

312
00:23:41,187 --> 00:23:45,521
Just 'cause you have a kid with someone
doesn't mean they're gonna stick around.

313
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:49,026
My dad didn't.
Couldn't fucking wait to get out.

314
00:23:49,128 --> 00:23:52,029
Well, I don't know
if I want to get married...

315
00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:55,032
but I wouldn't say no
to a proper relationship.

316
00:23:55,134 --> 00:23:57,602
What is a proper relationship?

317
00:23:58,804 --> 00:24:02,365
Living with someone who talks to ya
after they've bonked ya.

318
00:24:03,976 --> 00:24:07,377
I don't know what they want from you
half the time.

319
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:11,883
What they start off liking you for,
they end up hating you for.

320
00:24:11,984 --> 00:24:15,511
Don't like you if you're strong.
Don't like you if you're weak.

321
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:19,113
Hate you if you're clever.
Hate you if you're stupid.

322
00:24:19,225 --> 00:24:22,194
[Scoffs]
They don't know what they want.

323
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:30,060
You think that bastard's
fucked off yet?

324
00:24:31,237 --> 00:24:33,705
Yeah, he must have done by now.

325
00:25:12,044 --> 00:25:13,944
Is this a stick-up?

326
00:25:14,046 --> 00:25:15,946
[Chuckles]

327
00:25:16,048 --> 00:25:18,448
- So you must get that all the time, yeah?
- Yeah.

328
00:25:18,551 --> 00:25:20,178
Just got it again.

329
00:25:21,554 --> 00:25:25,581
So, is this your job,
or a nice little hobby you've got for yourself?

330
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:27,659
You're a lovely mover.

331
00:25:36,235 --> 00:25:38,135
- This your van, yeah?
- Yeah.

332
00:25:38,237 --> 00:25:41,138
It's, like, uh, I don't know,
top of the range.

333
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,140
[Chuckles]
Very nice.

334
00:25:43,242 --> 00:25:46,143
- Are you going up the road?
- You want a lift?

335
00:25:46,245 --> 00:25:48,805
- [Laughs] That all right with ya?
- Yeah.

336
00:25:48,914 --> 00:25:50,814
Cheers.

337
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:54,317
It's just I been walkin' round the streets
all night. You know what I mean?

338
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:57,389
These fuckin' feet are on their last legs,
I'm tellin' ya.

339
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:04,957
- So, how much do you earn for doin' this?
- It's none of your fuckin' business.

340
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:07,965
I mean, is the pay as substantial
as, say, the wages of sin?

341
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:10,501
Know what I mean?
You with me?

342
00:26:10,603 --> 00:26:14,130
Listen, captain, is it all right
if I have a go at doing this, yeah?

343
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,140
Oh! God love ya.

344
00:26:16,242 --> 00:26:20,372
Or does it take, like, thousands of years
of state-subsidized government training...

345
00:26:20,479 --> 00:26:22,379
to do this clobber, yeah?

346
00:26:22,481 --> 00:26:27,384
You gotta slap on, like, copious quantities
of the old industrial sputum there.

347
00:26:27,486 --> 00:26:29,386
Beg your pardon.

348
00:26:29,488 --> 00:26:32,389
It's a wonderful career opportunity for me.
You know what I mean?

349
00:26:32,491 --> 00:26:35,790
- I'm gonna play the joker on this one.
- Shift -

350
00:26:35,895 --> 00:26:38,295
- Very well -Aah!
- Shift out of the fucking way.

351
00:26:38,397 --> 00:26:41,628
No, I like Laurel and Hardy, although
apparently they didn't get on in real life.

352
00:26:41,734 --> 00:26:43,827
Another illusion shattered.

353
00:26:45,738 --> 00:26:48,866
Sorry about that, pal. It's just, I've had
a lot of bad experience with walls, you know...

354
00:26:48,974 --> 00:26:51,374
what with talking to them
and climbing them.

355
00:26:51,477 --> 00:26:54,378
Me dad's driven me up a good few in his time.
You know what I mean?

356
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,381
But I think I've got a secret -
a saucy little secret.

357
00:26:57,483 --> 00:27:00,919
The solipsistic, sagacious little secret
is just, you got -you just gotta...

358
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,920
bang your fuckin' head against 'em.

359
00:27:03,022 --> 00:27:06,651
Just crack the old pate -
Are you with me?

360
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:10,195
Have you got it? And that's it.
That is the key to enlightenment, which is -

361
00:27:10,296 --> 00:27:14,858
It's, like, that's why- that's why it's, like,
such a potent motif of civilization.

362
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:17,868
It's the wall - It's like
the Great Wall of China...

363
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:21,872
and the wall ofJericho
and the Berlin Wall and the wailing wall.

364
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:24,875
Now, you see, theJews,
they've almost got it, haven't they?

365
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:28,105
A real rockin' and that, you know.
Just six inches away and they'll be there.

366
00:27:28,214 --> 00:27:31,115
They'd have won the fucking race.
They'll be there. Are you with me?

367
00:27:31,217 --> 00:27:34,118
What is all this, anyway?
What are you doin'? Cancel everything.

368
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:37,121
In the beginning was the word,
and the word was "canceled."

369
00:27:37,223 --> 00:27:40,124
You get satisfaction out of this?
You think you're making a contribution?

370
00:27:40,226 --> 00:27:42,660
You're, like, sort of
publicly promulgating vacuities.

371
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:45,321
Are you with me?
Fuckin' hell!

372
00:27:48,467 --> 00:27:50,492
That's it!
Blank it all out!

373
00:27:50,603 --> 00:27:53,504
Blank it all out till you just atrophy
and die of fuckin' indifference!

374
00:27:53,606 --> 00:27:56,507
Can I show you something, pal?
You see that at the top of your legs?

375
00:27:56,609 --> 00:27:59,942
That's your ass, right, and that's your
fuckin' elbow. Do you wanna write it down or-

376
00:28:00,045 --> 00:28:02,639
[Groaning]
Oh!

377
00:28:02,748 --> 00:28:04,648
[Mutters]
Fuck. Ow.

378
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,650
Who's that supposed to be?
Me dad?

379
00:28:06,752 --> 00:28:10,347
[Coughs] You wanna watch that, mate.
I've got a dicky sacrum here.

380
00:28:10,456 --> 00:28:11,923
Shit.

381
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:15,959
F- [Coughs]
Uh, can you, uh, come back here?

382
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:17,961
Uh, did I upset ya?

You got me bag!

386
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:29,299
You fucking tosser!

387
00:28:29,408 --> 00:28:31,876
You've got - Fuck!

388
00:28:35,014 --> 00:28:37,107
Fuck!

389
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:40,117
All right, listen.
Does anybody mind if I scream here?

390
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:44,121
Is that okay with you all? 'Cause I'd
feel better for it. It won't take long.

Will you shut up, for God's sake.

[Coughing, Groaning]

Just give us a fag.

[Whispering]
Will you be quiet!

419
00:31:15,674 --> 00:31:18,643

Oh, fuck. Shit.

00:34:31,603 --> 00:34:34,003
- Who's this?
- It's all right. He's a friend of mine.

[Jeremy]
What extraordinary friends you have.

453
00:34:37,643 --> 00:34:40,612
- He's only got one sock on.
- [Louise] Shut up!

454
00:34:40,712 --> 00:34:44,113
[Jeremy] You seem a bit tense, Sophie.
Would you like a massage?

- Is he the doctor?
- You're rather disgusting, aren't you?

You're not crying,
are you, Louise?

Oh, listen,
when are you gonna fuck off?

to do with you. Right?

No! No! Stop!

You don't know.

620
00:46:26,451 --> 00:46:29,909
- Is he all right?
- Yeah.

621
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:38,023
What, is this a spectator sport or something?
The hundred-meter vomit?

622
00:46:43,334 --> 00:46:46,895
Sophie, do you mind if I have
a word with Johnny on me own?

623
00:46:53,277 --> 00:46:56,246
Do you want a word with Louise
on your own?

624
00:46:56,347 --> 00:46:58,611
- Are you being sarcastic?
- No.

625
00:46:59,717 --> 00:47:02,242
Well, do as you're told.

626
00:47:03,488 --> 00:47:05,456
Right.

627
00:47:08,426 --> 00:47:11,361
Whose is all this money?
Three hundred and eighty pounds.

628
00:47:11,462 --> 00:47:15,262
It really oughtn't to be left laying,
waiting for-

629
00:47:26,144 --> 00:47:29,113
- Whose is all that?
- Don't know.

630
00:47:35,787 --> 00:47:37,982
Who's been playing ping-pong
with your face?

631
00:47:38,089 --> 00:47:40,649
Sky fell in on me.

632
00:47:40,758 --> 00:47:43,056
A cloud caught me
across the cheek.

633
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:49,166
- So, why did you come to London?
- Come to run in the marathon.

634
00:47:49,267 --> 00:47:51,462
Will you give me
a straight answer, please?

635
00:47:53,438 --> 00:47:57,067
Well, I had to get out of Manchester
'cause I was gonna get a beating...

636
00:47:57,175 --> 00:48:00,906
and I come down here
and, uh... get a beating.

637
00:48:01,012 --> 00:48:03,071
- Were you asking for it?
- No.

638
00:48:03,181 --> 00:48:05,240
I wasn't.
They just come out of nowhere.

639
00:48:05,349 --> 00:48:07,647
- Honest?
- Yeah.

640
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:14,585
- So, what you gonna do?
- What you gonna do?

641
00:48:15,693 --> 00:48:17,991
What are you gonna do?

642
00:48:18,096 --> 00:48:20,690
Don't know.
Might go home for the weekend.

643
00:48:20,798 --> 00:48:22,891
Well, there's no place like it.

644
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,968
Might not come back.

645
00:48:26,571 --> 00:48:28,539
Are you going back?

646
00:48:33,945 --> 00:48:35,913
Is that nice?

647
00:48:37,682 --> 00:48:40,879
- Yeah.
- I'm puttin' the "fun" back in fundament.

648
00:48:40,985 --> 00:48:42,976
Are ya?

649
00:48:44,555 --> 00:48:47,683
- Well, I'll have to go back sometime, won't I?
- And what about us?

650
00:48:47,792 --> 00:48:50,158
What about us?

651
00:48:54,866 --> 00:48:57,664
- Do ya hate me?
- Fuck off.

652
00:49:02,073 --> 00:49:04,507
My mum was seven years
younger than you when she had me.

653
00:49:04,609 --> 00:49:06,634
- Don't.
- What?
- Just -

654
00:49:08,412 --> 00:49:11,142
- Well, she was.
- [Sighs]

655
00:49:11,249 --> 00:49:13,149
[Scoffs]

656
00:49:13,251 --> 00:49:15,242
- I'm full of shit, aren't I?
- Sometimes.

657
00:49:15,353 --> 00:49:19,221
- Well, I've had it all kicked out of me now.
- Oh. Good.

658
00:49:20,992 --> 00:49:24,894
What if God just put us here
for his own entertainment?

659
00:49:24,996 --> 00:49:29,399
That's all we are -just something
for him to have a bit of a laugh at.

660
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:31,161
Could be, couldn't it...

661
00:49:31,269 --> 00:49:33,362
if you think about it?

662
00:49:36,507 --> 00:49:39,067
Give us your right hand.

663
00:49:39,177 --> 00:49:41,145
The other way up.

664
00:49:43,014 --> 00:49:45,983
- [Squeaks, Snickers]
- [Chuckles]

665
00:49:48,786 --> 00:49:51,584
- [Squeaks]
- What's that?

666
00:49:53,457 --> 00:49:56,221
- That's funny to me.
- You're daft, you.

667
00:49:56,327 --> 00:49:58,625
It's, uh, toilet humor.

668
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:05,097
Will you give me a cuddle, Johnny?

669
00:50:05,203 --> 00:50:07,171
Yeah.

670
00:50:09,974 --> 00:50:12,442
[Sobbing]

671
00:50:19,684 --> 00:50:22,653
[Sophie Continues Sobbing]

672
00:50:27,692 --> 00:50:30,160
[Sophie Continues Sobbing]

673
00:50:33,931 --> 00:50:35,831
[Sandra]
What's the matter?

674
00:50:35,933 --> 00:50:38,902
- Can you not tell me?
- [Sobbing Continues]

675
00:50:52,683 --> 00:50:56,084
[Sandra] If no one tells me what's going on,
then how am I supposed to-

676
00:50:56,187 --> 00:50:58,087
[Sobbing]
I don't understand, Johnny!

677
00:50:58,189 --> 00:51:00,623
- How was Zambia?
- [Shouting] It was Zimbabwe!

678
00:51:00,725 --> 00:51:04,092
I went to Zimbabwe with
my wanker boyfriend - my ex -

679
00:51:04,195 --> 00:51:06,095
[Sophie]
What did I do wrong?

680
00:51:06,197 --> 00:51:08,097
Did you see any big animals?

681
00:51:08,199 --> 00:51:12,636
Yes! We saw elephants and rhinos
and zebras and lions and vultures.

682
00:51:12,737 --> 00:51:15,137
- Did you see any monkeys?
- We saw many monkeys.

683
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:17,139
- Were they cheeky?
- [Sophie Moaning]

684
00:51:17,241 --> 00:51:19,641
It's not good for me, is it,
all this, in my condition?

685
00:51:19,744 --> 00:51:23,578
Well, yes - No -Yes - [Stammering]
It's not good for me, it's not good for you.

686
00:51:23,681 --> 00:51:27,583
- It's not good for any of us! It's utterly-
- Oh, excuse me for living!

687
00:51:27,685 --> 00:51:30,153
[Sobbing, Whimpering]

688
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:33,685
Is - Is this it, Johnny?

689
00:51:33,791 --> 00:51:35,691
- [Gasping]
- Is what it?

690
00:51:35,793 --> 00:51:38,421
[Sobbing]
I can't bear it!

691
00:51:40,131 --> 00:51:42,031
Right. I'm off!

692
00:51:42,133 --> 00:51:44,033
[Snickers]
Off your trolley.

693
00:51:44,135 --> 00:51:48,196
Oh, don't fucking take the piss
out of me, you bastard!

694
00:51:48,306 --> 00:51:50,206
You don't know!

695
00:51:50,308 --> 00:51:54,369
All I want - [Stammers]
Nobody has any-

696
00:51:54,478 --> 00:51:56,878
[Sandra]
Can you just please try and-

697
00:51:56,981 --> 00:52:00,075
- [Sophie] I've had enough! Oh, God!
- [Sandra] This is a nightmare!

698
00:52:00,184 --> 00:52:02,084
[Sophie Continues Sobbing]

699
00:52:02,186 --> 00:52:05,087
- If you could just try and pull yourself together-
- Where you going?

700
00:52:05,189 --> 00:52:08,090
- I don't know!
- Why don't you come and have a lie-down?

701
00:52:08,192 --> 00:52:10,092
- I don't care!
- Sophie!

702
00:52:10,194 --> 00:52:12,594
- Here's the keys!
- I don't want the keys.

703
00:52:12,697 --> 00:52:16,793
- Well, I don't fucking want 'em!
- I'm not a social worker!

704
00:52:16,901 --> 00:52:18,801
Sophie.

705
00:52:18,903 --> 00:52:20,803
Don't be fucking stupid.

706
00:52:20,905 --> 00:52:23,396
What's the point, Louise?

707
00:52:23,507 --> 00:52:26,908
- [Sobbing Continues]
- Sophie!

708
00:52:27,745 --> 00:52:30,441
I'm sorry.

709
00:52:35,453 --> 00:52:38,013
[Whimpering]

710
00:52:54,872 --> 00:52:56,840
Johnny.

711
00:53:05,383 --> 00:53:07,283
You all right?

712
00:53:07,385 --> 00:53:10,445
- Mmm?
- I'm going.

713
00:53:10,554 --> 00:53:13,455
- Where?
- Work, to hand me notice in.

714
00:53:13,557 --> 00:53:16,458
Then I'm coming back here
and packing me bags and I'm going home.

715
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,824
- Do you want to come?
- Today?

716
00:53:18,929 --> 00:53:20,157
- Yeah.
- You serious?

717
00:53:20,264 --> 00:53:21,822
- Yeah.
- How?

718
00:53:21,932 --> 00:53:23,559
Bus.

719
00:53:26,404 --> 00:53:28,304
- Well, have you got enough dough?
- Yeah.

720
00:53:28,406 --> 00:53:30,533
- 'Cause I've not got nothin'.
- I know.

721
00:53:33,244 --> 00:53:36,145
Do you think you can make it?

722
00:53:36,247 --> 00:53:37,874
Don't know.

723
00:53:39,417 --> 00:53:42,716
Well, if you can't,
we can stay here till tomorrow.

724
00:53:54,598 --> 00:53:56,566
I'll see you later.

725
00:53:57,835 --> 00:54:00,497
Uh, can you leave us a few fags
for cancer research?

726
00:54:00,604 --> 00:54:02,572
Here are your sh -

727
00:54:03,741 --> 00:54:06,642
I was actually hoping
that the air could-

728
00:54:06,744 --> 00:54:09,372
What are we gonna do
about all this?

729
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:11,380
I don't know, Sandra.

730
00:54:11,482 --> 00:54:13,450
Look, I'll see you
in a couple of hours.

731
00:54:13,551 --> 00:54:15,781
- Fine.
- Uh, you will come back?

732
00:54:15,886 --> 00:54:17,786
Yeah. Of course I will.

733
00:54:17,888 --> 00:54:19,981
- Because I need -
- You'll be all right, won't ya?

734
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:24,390
- Will I be all right, love?
- I'm gonna get the bath cleaned.

735
00:54:42,346 --> 00:54:44,974
You all know what it does to you...

736
00:54:45,082 --> 00:54:48,643
and yet you still insist on doing it,
so do it.

737
00:54:48,752 --> 00:54:51,186
Smoke yourself to...

738
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:53,188
Well, birds do it, bees do it.

739
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:55,656
High heaven.

740
00:54:55,759 --> 00:54:57,659
Can you tell me something, love?

741
00:54:57,761 --> 00:55:00,662
Is it true that some babies
are born covered in fur?

742
00:55:00,764 --> 00:55:02,994
- Up.
- [Grunts]

743
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:05,000
Thank you.

744
00:55:05,102 --> 00:55:08,003
And you know, at birth,
when you cut the umbilical cord...

745
00:55:08,105 --> 00:55:11,506
what would happen if, uh-
well, if it was never cut?

746
00:55:11,609 --> 00:55:14,578
I don't need this. I just -

747
00:55:14,678 --> 00:55:17,374
Well, it'd be embarrassing, wouldn't it?
Especially at my age.

748
00:55:17,481 --> 00:55:20,382
Why do you feel the need
to take the piss?

749
00:55:20,484 --> 00:55:22,247
I'm not taking a piss.

750
00:55:22,353 --> 00:55:25,049
- It's nice, that. Where is it from?
- I don't know.

751
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:26,850
It's something my dad -

752
00:55:26,957 --> 00:55:29,221
Now, you see, Sophie
just turned that to the wall.

753
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:32,523
She's got this kind of
irritating proclivity for negation.

754
00:55:32,630 --> 00:55:34,598
Suppose she thinks
it's progressive or something.

755
00:55:34,698 --> 00:55:37,861
- What is your problem?
- Nothing. What's your problem?

756
00:55:37,968 --> 00:55:41,199
All these silly questions and -

757
00:55:41,305 --> 00:55:45,366
Well, look, I've never met a nurse before,
and I'm just interested in, uh -well, in life.

758
00:55:45,476 --> 00:55:47,740
I mean, do you think it's worth savin'?

759
00:55:47,845 --> 00:55:49,745
Of course I do!

760
00:55:49,847 --> 00:55:52,509
But there is a time and a place...

761
00:55:52,616 --> 00:55:56,609
and, actually,
this isn't the time or-

762
00:55:57,388 --> 00:55:59,481
- The place?
- No.

763
00:55:59,590 --> 00:56:03,185
And this is where I -

764
00:56:03,294 --> 00:56:05,489
- Live?
- Yes!

765
00:56:05,596 --> 00:56:07,496
And I'm not feeling very-

766
00:56:07,598 --> 00:56:09,225
- Sexy?
- Comfortable, actually.

767
00:56:09,333 --> 00:56:11,062
I'm not feeling very comfortable.

768
00:56:11,168 --> 00:56:14,729
Well, make yourself comfortable, love,
or slip into something more [Mouths Word].

769
00:56:16,807 --> 00:56:18,707
My bath -
[Stammers]

770
00:56:18,809 --> 00:56:23,940
Hot toast, hot milk,
hot water bottle, bed, sleep.

771
00:56:24,048 --> 00:56:26,539
- Do you like me?
- I don't know you.

772
00:56:26,650 --> 00:56:29,380
- So -
