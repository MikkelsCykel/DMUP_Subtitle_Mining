00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:21,780
How'd that happen?

2
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:23,900
lf l can ask.

3
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,060
Oh.

4
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:28,900
Before time,

5
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,740
l was sick, bad lung, TB.

6
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,300
At this time no doctor
where l live.

7
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:37,260
Khmer Rouge kill our doctor.

8
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:40,940
So, l walk to border
for medicine,

9
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:45,260
but l must cross
the mine field first.

10
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,500
You never forget that sound.

11
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:49,820
The first thing you hear
is click.

12
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,460
lt's your foot priming
the land mine.

13
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,940
Soon as you hear it,

14
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,860
it's over.

15
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,820
But your mind go crazy,
you know?

16
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,660
You thinking, maybe if l jump,

17
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:06,380
maybe if l find a rock
to match my weight...

18
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:10,340
But it's nothing you can do.

19
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:13,260
You hear the click
and big bye-bye.

20
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,900
But,

21
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,980
l was lucky.

22
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,540
Just lose my leg.

23
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,700
Any problems?

24
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,300
None.

25
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,100
You're not wearing perfume.

26
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:26,020
So, are you going to tell me
where we're going?

27
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,220
A place near Pailin,

28
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,180
by the border.

29
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:33,580
And the boat's
the best way to travel?

30
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,500
You don't like my boat?

31
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,260
l think it's very you.

32
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,860
lt's safer.

33
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,460
Avoids the road blocks,

34
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,300
the Viet troops,
plus other assorted madness.

35
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,940
You know, heart of darkness.

36
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,140
The horror.

37
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,420
Actually it is.

38
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,860
Horrible.

39
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,940
And now you're going
to tell me why.

40
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,380
Well, Elliott's no good, is he?

41
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,580
All he gives you is
the Buddhist version,

42
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:05,660
all fucking temples

43
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:08,860
and gentle people,
which is bollocks.

44
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:09,980
The Khmer Rouge--

45
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:12,220
rouge being very much
the appropriate color--

46
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,620
used Pailin as a hideout.

47
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,820
Everyone lives
in absolute terror.

48
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,060
They use the women
as baby-making factories,

49
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,340
the kids as mine sweepers,

50
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:21,460
and just in case
we actually help anybody,

51
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,020
they come and steal everything

52
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,140
that we don't hide.

53
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,180
So why do they let you
stay at all?

54
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,300
They've got no doctors.

55
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,340
l should be singing
''Old Man River.''

56
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,220
Please don't.

57
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,220
Colonel Tao,
how are you doing?

58
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,060
lt's good to see you again.

59
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,500
The boxes, they for who?

60
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,940
Well, you know who they're for.

61
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,060
l give you my word.

62
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,660
This goes only
to the women and children.

63
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,500
Wait, easy, that's medicine,
for Christ's sake!

64
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,820
l don't understand,
what's the problem?

65
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,540
lt's a laptop.

66
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,780
Every NGO has got one.

67
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,340
That's the way
we do business here.

68
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,900
Don't throw those away.

69
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,860
People's lives depend on that,
for fuck's sake!

70
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,180
-Colonel...
-Sarah...

71
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,140
l'm with UNHCR, United Nations.

72
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,300
This cargo is protected.

73
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,180
lf this shipment is harmed
in any way,

74
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,700
your name will surface
in the follow-up investigation.

75
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:57,700
l don't...

76
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,700
l promise you,
l know nothing about this.

77
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:25,780
Somebody must have...

78
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,780
Colonel Tao, you know me.

79
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:48,900
l swear to God,

80
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,140
l don't...

81
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,420
Son of a bitch!

82
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,140
What was that?

83
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,260
You explain it to me.

84
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:23,580
l can't explain it to you.

85
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:24,540
We were set up.

86
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,700
l knew nothing about that book,

87
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,100
what was in the box,
the equipment...

88
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,620
Did you know about the guns?

89
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,180
Did you know about the guns?

90
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,420
Answer me!
Did you know...?

91
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,580
Yes, l knew about them.

92
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,700
l came here
to help these people,

93
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,060
and the only way
l can do that

94
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,740
-is if l transport guns.
-You don't have

95
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:41,940
to transport guns
to help people.

96
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,060
You do here.

97
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,860
Right. So fuck the next person
that tries to bring

98
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,340
a shipment full of medicine
in for people.

99
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,300
Fuck them.

100
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,500
As long as you get
what you need today,

101
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:50,620
fuck everybody else!

102
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,740
No one else comes here,

103
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:52,980
so what do you want me to do?

104
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,260
You want me to watch
thousands of kids die of measles

105
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,660
'cause l wouldn't
bend the rules?

106
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,900
ls that a price worth paying?

107
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,700
Or am l actually killing
more than l save?

108
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,980
You seriously believe that
l don't worry about that?

109
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:04,420
That l don't think about that
every minute of every day?

110
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,700
What's worse?
You tell me.

111
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,740
You tell me what l should do.

112
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,100
What happened?

113
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,700
Never compromise
another organization

114
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:53,220
for your own ever again.

115
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:55,660
l won't.

116
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,140
Sarah, you made it.

117
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,780
Oh, good to see you.

118
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:03,180
So, l believe congratulations
are in order?

119
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,100
l know, can you believe it?

120
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,060
Oh...

121
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,740
What the hell happened?

122
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,860
No guns--
confiscated by Tao.

123
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:12,300
He found
these intelligence files.

124
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,820
They freaked him out.

125
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:14,780
What intelligence files?

126
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:15,900
Well, how do l know?

127
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,140
He was tipped off.
He was waiting for us.

128
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,660
He found these documents.
He went fucking crazy.

129
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,780
Well, if we don't have anything
for the Khmer Rouge,

130
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:21,740
we're in deep shit.

131
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:22,700
We leave in the morning.

132
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:23,780
Take everyone with us.

133
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:24,940
No, we need to leave
sooner than that.

134
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,780
We've got all this vaccine.
l'm not wasting it.

135
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,460
We don't have time.
We need to go now.

136
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,660
Not until we vaccinate.

137
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,980
This is not worth risking
our lives for.

138
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:36,420
You do whatever you got to do.
l'm staying.

139
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,900
Joss, remember to pack
the iodine.

140
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:00,140
And the emergency kits--
how many we got?

141
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,260
Joss?

142
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:15,660
No, no. They...

143
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:20,780
He says that we're thieves,
that we stole his files

144
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,020
and his guns,
and he wants them back.

145
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,980
Tell him the truth.

146
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,660
And tell him that we're trying

147
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,580
to save his bloody people.

148
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:38,020
He doesn't give a shit
about the people.

149
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:39,460
He just want the file.

150
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,860
So tell him whatever he wants.

151
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:43,460
Just try and buy us
some time.

152
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:54,940
He wants us to...

153
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,020
He wants us to what?

154
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,900
He wants us to make amends now.

155
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:02,180
He wants us to go to Pailin.

156
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,420
You know what that means.

157
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:05,300
He say now.

158
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,260
Okay.

159
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:09,900
Tell him that Sarah
is from the UN.

160
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,820
And that the UN is very
important to Big God Ankha,

161
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,780
and if anything happens to her
or to us,

162
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,020
the UN will crucify him.

163
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:30,700
He say you are a ClA agent
working for Vietnam.

164
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:33,980
One of you must die.

165
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:50,180
English doctor, you say
all you care about is my people.

166
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,980
Life mean nothing.

167
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:29,060
We serve only Ankha.

168
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,900
Now you will see.

169
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,540
For God's sake,
he's just a baby.

170
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:40,500
Tell them to drop their guns.

171
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,700
Tell them to drop
their fucking weapons now!

172
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,500
No!

173
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:47,980
Tell them to back off.
Back off!

174
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,540
Tell them to back off.

175
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,460
Tell them to back off.

176
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:06,060
Look, as long
as we hold due west,

177
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,460
we hit the river.

178
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,780
That's about two miles.

179
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,140
And the camp's up there.

180
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,540
About another three miles north,
just over the Thai border.

181
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,500
Oh, Jesus.

182
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,060
Shit. That's Khmer Rouge.

183
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,220
They've reached the village.

184
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,020
At this rate,
they're going to catch up.

185
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,740
Keep them moving.

186
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,180
Keep them moving!

187
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,820
Tell them we're nearly there.

188
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,060
Sierra Tango 619.

189
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,220
Sierra Tango 619.

190
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,900
This is Outpost Grade Seven.

191
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:10,180
Sierra Tango, come in.

192
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:28,140
Me father.
Me father.

193
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:46,300
Look! Look! Helicopter!

194
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,260
Helicopter!

195
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,660
Helicopter!

196
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,740
Looks Vietnamese, mate.

197
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:03,580
Good, that will keep them busy.

198
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:36,780
Nick?

199
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:44,100
lt wasn't your fault.

200
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,460
Yes, it was.

201
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,980
lf l'd have listened to him,

202
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:50,660
none of this
would have happened.

203
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,780
l couldn't even
bury him properly.

204
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:55,620
l didn't even give him
a decent fucking burial.

205
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:58,220
Elliott wanted to dedicate
his life

206
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,820
to helping other people.

207
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:04,220
And in the end,
he died for them.

208
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,860
Be proud of him.

209
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:13,300
Miss him...
but be proud of him.

210
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:19,700
l don't know what
l'm going to do without him.

211
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:23,860
l can't stop;
l've got to keep going.

212
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:27,780
-There's so much...
-l'm worried about you, here.

213
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:31,780
l'm worried that something
is going to happen to you.

214
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,580
Every day for four years,

215
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,620
every morning,
l wake up and l wonder

216
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,220
if you're okay,
if you're still alive,

217
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,380
where you are.

218
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:37,620
Shall l ring down
for some room service?

219
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:41,260
Chocolate cake...

220
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,820
and some air-conditioning.

221
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,140
That'd be lovely.

222
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:53,660
How did you meet Henry?

223
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:56,100
l was staring at a Roscoe.

224
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:58,540
What's that,
some sort of dishwasher?

225
00:20:58,580 --> 00:20:59,980
lt was a painting.

226
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:02,620
l used to work
at an art gallery.

227
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,860
And one day, Henry came in.

228
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:08,340
How old were you?

229
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:11,420
Too young.

230
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:15,700
But you stayed together?

231
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:18,540
Yeah.

232
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:21,540
We've both known that
the marriage has been over

233
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,540
for a long time.

234
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:26,300
But we stayed together
for Jimmy.

235
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:28,580
You love him very much,
don't you?

236
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:31,540
He's amazing.

237
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,700
l'm going to have
to start making plans

238
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:58,580
to go to New York.

239
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:02,220
See Elliott's parents,
tell them what happened.

240
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,460
How long will you be gone?

241
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,740
l don't know, no idea.

242
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:11,980
What is this?

243
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,700
What are you doing?

244
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:19,500
l'm absolutely crazy about you.

245
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:22,140
l can't stop thinking about you.

246
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,260
You're always in my mind;
you're in my heart;

247
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,500
you're in every fucking bit
of me.

248
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:28,500
But l can't go there with you.

249
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,700
l can't do it.

250
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:31,340
Look at what happens
to people around me.

251
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:32,380
lt's not good.

252
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,820
-l'm not good for you.
-That's not true.

253
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,900
Listen, believe me,
if l could live this life again,

254
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,460
l would never leave you
for a second.

255
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,580
But you belong with your family,
and l belong here,

256
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,500
and there's nothing
we can do about it.

257
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:42,980
Because whichever way
you look at it,

258
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:43,980
somebody gets hurt.

259
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:24,580
One, two, three.

260
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,380
-Oh.
-Oops.

261
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:39,180
Oh!

262
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:49,420
Happy birthday to you

263
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:53,060
Happy birthday
to you

264
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:57,020
Happy birthday, dear Sarah

265
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:01,700
Happy birthday to you.

266
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,060
Thank you.

267
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,980
Thank you, baby.

268
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:12,260
Oh, that was lovely.

269
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,700
Lovely playing, lovely cake.

270
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:15,740
My playing

271
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:17,260
was lovelier than his cake.

272
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,260
Mom.

273
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:20,380
They were both exactly
as lovely as each other.

274
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:22,180
l think you better
blow the candles out

275
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,260
before the cake catches fire.

276
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:25,860
Wait until they do you
a candle for each decade, dear.

277
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:28,500
Then you'll know
you're past it.

278
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,940
Didn't forget to make a wish.

279
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,500
Got it.

280
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:40,820
Oh!

281
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:49,540
Mom, when are we going
to open the presents?

282
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:50,860
Now.

283
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:52,860
Many of you know her
from her work

284
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,660
with the Elliott Hauser
Foundation

285
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,020
for the lnternational Promotion
of Human Rights.

286
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,860
ln more recent years however,

287
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:01,140
she has become an active
lobbyist at Whitehall

288
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:04,900
on issues of asylum
and refugee protection.

289
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:07,780
Ladies and gentlemen,
it gives me great pleasure

290
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:10,580
to introduce
our new spokesperson

291
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,620
for the UNHCR
in the United Kingdom,

292
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:15,060
Mrs. Sarah Bauford.

293
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:29,220
Thank you.

294
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:33,060
Thank you.

295
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,460
Ladies and gentlemen,

296
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:39,700
l feel very nervous to be
standing in front of you today.

297
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:42,540
l also feel very honored.

298
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,940
ln particular, because
UNHCR was the organization

299
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:49,580
to which l was first introduced
by my friend Elliott Hauser.

300
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,060
l know that my being
offered this post

301
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,660
would have given him
enormous pleasure.

302
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:56,340
Over 50 million people

303
00:25:56,420 --> 00:26:00,100
are refugees or displaced
persons in the world today.

304
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:03,140
And because of closed minds
and funding shortfalls,

305
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:06,540
we are only able to reach
half of those in need.

306
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:17,980
So we rely on our partners,

307
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:20,780
the network of aid groups
blazing a trail across crises,

308
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:24,420
like El Salvador, Angola,

309
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:27,700
Chechnya, Sri Lanka...

310
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:31,740
those NGO's, the non-
governmental groups from OXFAM

311
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,140
right down
to the smallest outfits

312
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,580
run by people like Elliott
and...

313
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:44,580
...and l pray for those
who survive him--

314
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:46,420
who continue his work--

315
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,860
without certainty or security--

316
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,660
wherever they may be
in this world.

317
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,860
Excuse me.

318
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,420
Hey.

319
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,700
Hey.

320
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:11,900
Thanks for coming.

321
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,580
Listen, l travel
thousands of miles

322
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:15,140
to hear my sister
give a speech,

323
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,580
l got a backache and jet lag.

324
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,100
What's a taxi ride to the park?

325
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:20,180
Sorry.
Are they angry?

326
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:21,780
No. They don't care, Sarah.

327
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:23,740
l think they actually
kind of enjoyed it.

328
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:26,100
''She's nuts'' makes
for much better conversation

329
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,500
than ''Nice speech.''

330
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,860
l got a letter from Nick,

331
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,580
and l think he's in trouble.

332
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,660
Why? What did he say?

333
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,780
Nothing, really.
Just little things.

334
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,420
Well, where is he?

335
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:40,780
He's in Chechnya.

336
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,980
He's running
some sort of camp.

337
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,500
l'm really not sure.

338
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,020
l need to find him.

339
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,500
So, you have contacts.

340
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,420
You can find out where he is.

341
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,900
So, please?

342
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:54,220
Sarah, sweetheart,
you know as well as l do

343
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:57,660
that Chechnya is
a very dangerous place.

344
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:06,380
Yes, l can angle
a story there, l'm sure.

345
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:09,700
lf l find out anything,
l will let you know. Okay?

346
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,940
Okay. Okay.

347
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:14,380
Okay.

348
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,860
Thank you.

349
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:23,740
Perhaps we are all refugees
from something,

350
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:26,980
but l see now
there is nothing to fear;

351
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:31,180
that the world we hold on to,
the lives we cherish,

352
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:35,820
are a part of something greater
--something more.

353
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:39,140
When l look at my children,
l see it so clearly--

354
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,740
that hope--

355
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:43,140
that chance of life--

356
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:45,420
and l know
it's worth fighting for.

357
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:49,060
''The wedding was
a splendid affair.

358
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:51,020
''Everyone attended--

359
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:53,700
''the dwarves, and the
animals of the forest--

360
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:55,260
''and there were tears of joy

361
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,580
''and songs of happiness,

362
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:58,340
''and the prince
and the princess

363
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:01,540
lived happily ever after.''

364
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:04,100
How does it really end, Mummy?

365
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,580
What do you mean?

366
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,660
What do you think happens,
honey?

367
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:11,340
She wakes up,
looks at the prince,

368
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:14,580
and goes, ''Eww! Boys. Yucky!''

369
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,660
Hello.

370
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:19,580
Hi, Henry. lt's Charlotte.
ls Sarah there?

371
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:20,860
Charlotte, hi.

372
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,940
Uh... well, she's upstairs
with the kids right now.

373
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,060
Can l take a message?

374
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:26,700
Oh. Okay. Um...
Then could you just, uh...

375
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:29,940
Just let her know that
l will call her later, okay?

376
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:33,180
Well, l can take a message.

377
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:36,980
Um... well, then, just tell her
that l've got some news, uh...

378
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:40,860
and that l will... l will fax it
to her office in the morning.

379
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:42,140
Okay?

380
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,380
Right. Okay.

381
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,020
Um... l'll pass that on.

382
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:47,740
Okay. Thanks, Henry. Bye, now.

383
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,220
Bye.

384
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:03,260
That was Charlotte.

385
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:06,980
She said, um...
she has some news.

386
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:10,260
She'll fax you at the office.

387
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:59,420
So this is it, is it?

388
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,340
You kiss the children good-bye,
scribble a quick note, and then

389
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,780
sneak off into the night.

390
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:06,420
Have you any idea
how fucking cruel that is?

391
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,140
l'm not sneaking off.

392
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,740
l'm not leaving the children.

393
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,900
You could have talked to me.

394
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:15,580
l mean, writing a note--
it's, uh...

395
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:18,140
l just thought
it would be easier.

396
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,420
Than what?

397
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:22,860
Than having
this conversation again.

398
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:27,580
God, this is so...

399
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:37,420
l should be back by Friday.

400
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,940
Dinners are in the freezer.

401
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:42,300
Their swimsuits
are in the dryer.

402
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:44,860
They have swimming
tomorrow at 4:00.

403
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:47,260
lt's all in the note.

404
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,940
l want this to be as easy
as possible for them.

405
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,780
And we'll talk about this.

406
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:56,940
We'll talk about everything
when l get home.

407
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,580
Sniper!

408
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:45,940
Oh, God...

409
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:50,380
This is total carnage,

410
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:52,180
and not a single western leader
has said a thing

411
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,380
about what's going on here.

412
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:54,780
There's no threats,
no criticism,

413
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:55,900
no fucking comment.

414
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,380
This place might
as well not exist.

415
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:58,900
And now that
we're all they have,

416
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:00,580
they want us to save face
for them.

417
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,980
Well, fuck that. They should
get off their fucking asses

418
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,780
and get the fuck out here. Shit.

419
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:06,260
Sorry. l'm still swearing.

420
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:07,700
Freeze it there.

421
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:09,820
Can we cut?

422
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:19,060
Okay.

423
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,220
Roll tape.

424
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:26,100
Basically, nothing has changed.

425
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:28,180
People keep saying that
everything has changed.

426
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:29,460
Not from where l'm standing.

427
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:30,740
Chechnya, Somalia, Cambodia,

428
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:33,060
Ethiopia--
it's the same shit every time,

429
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:35,300
and it's just going to go on
and on until we stop pretending

430
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:36,780
that our loyalty ends
with the asshole...

431
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:01,580
You okay?

432
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,260
What do you know?

433
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,500
An English news crew
filmed it six days ago.

434
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:08,060
The sound man is dead,
the cameraman is in a coma,

435
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:09,380
and Nick has disappeared.

436
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:11,100
We think it's bandits--

437
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:13,180
Chechens looking for money--

438
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:15,220
but there's been
no ransom demand.

439
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:20,580
Sarah, l want you
to meet Bob Strauss.

440
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:22,020
He's with the lCRC here.

441
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,540
He's been helping us.

442
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:27,020
Hi.

443
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:28,500
No, sit. Sit, please.

444
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:34,460
So, the, um...
net result right now

445
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,180
is we don't know who took Nick.

446
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,900
We don't know if he pissed off

447
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,540
the Russians or the Chechens.

448
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:41,660
We're pretty sure
there was a motive.

449
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:42,740
What was he doing?

450
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:43,780
l think you know

451
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:45,940
he wasn't just
a doctor anymore.

452
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,780
He, uh...
l'd have to say--

453
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,500
and this is well known--

454
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:51,860
Nick's activities
went quite a way

455
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:53,380
beyond what you'd call
famine relief.

456
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:54,340
How do we find him?

457
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:57,260
Well, nobody l've spoken to

458
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,300
has any leads yet.

459
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:01,340
Can we offer a reward?

460
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:06,460
Can... can...
can we do something?

461
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:08,900
The best thing for you
to do is to stay

462
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:11,060
in the hotel for
a couple of days. Be patient.

463
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:12,900
No. No.

464
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,660
No.

465
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,140
Sarah.

466
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:19,580
Sarah, listen to me.

467
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:21,220
This place,
they will take journalists,

468
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:22,660
Red Cross, anybody.

469
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:24,580
Don't think for one second
that you are immune.

470
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:26,020
l don't.

471
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:27,820
Just listen
to what Strauss said.

472
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:29,500
l don't care what Strauss said.

473
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,300
Sarah, l love you.

474
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:33,540
l want you to be safe. Go home.

475
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:36,060
l swear to God, l will let you
know if we hear anything.

476
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:37,020
Say it.

477
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:37,980
What?

478
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:39,060
Say it.

479
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:44,580
People disappear here;
they don't come back.

480
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:48,060
l'm not leaving
until l find him.

481
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,500
Okay.

482
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:20,060
Charley?

483
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,740
Who is it?

484
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:33,500
Mrs. Bauford?

485
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:34,940
My name is Jan Steiger.

486
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,420
l'm a friend of Nick's.

487
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:38,780
May l?

488
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:43,140
We work together.

489
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:44,900
On and off.

490
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:49,060
You should move your bed.

491
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,620
lt's too near the window.

492
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,860
Were you working together here?

493
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:55,620
Yes, in a manner of speaking.

494
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:56,900
How'd you know where l was?

495
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,260
My sister?

496
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:00,980
Oh, no, l'm not a journalist,
Mrs. Bauford.

497
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:02,580
l'm more import/export.

498
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:05,860
Cambodia, we nearly met.

499
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:08,180
Actually,

500
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:10,100
Nick mentioned you a few times.

501
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:11,900
l most certainly would have.

502
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:13,220
What do you want?

503
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:15,660
What do you want, Mrs. Bauford?

504
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:17,060
l want to know where Nick is.

505
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,940
Last l heard,

506
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:20,580
he was being held
in the mountains--

507
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:21,820
a rebel position,

508
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,580
about five, six miles
northeast of here.

509
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:25,620
Whole area's under heavy
Russian shelling now,

510
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,460
but l managed
to make radio contact.

511
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:29,940
They were negotiating,
they knew who he was.

512
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:35,020
But that was yesterday,
been nothing since.

513
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:38,140
Chances are that he's dead.

514
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:41,540
So why are you telling me this?

515
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:43,940
l'm curious.

516
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:46,860
l mean, you come
to this shit-hole in hell,

517
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:50,140
and you think you can find him?

518
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:52,100
What is it?

519
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:53,540
ls this... love?

520
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:54,940
ls that what it is?

521
00:39:58,660 --> 00:39:59,900
Okay, whatever.

522
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:02,020
You're here.

523
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,500
Now...

524
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:05,460
if l get him back alive.

525
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:07,860
l'll lose one less operative.

526
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:11,100
lf he's dead, he's dead.

527
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:14,380
Of course l'm not stupid enough
to risk my own ass

528
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:16,340
for some fucked-up big mouth.

529
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:21,100
But you, you're willing
to risk your life for love.

530
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:26,340
l'll trade with anything,
Mrs. Bauford.

531
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:28,220
Anything at all.

532
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:32,060
Fine.

533
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:35,500
What do l do?

534
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:37,980
l have a friend, a local.

535
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:40,660
He can get you
into the mountains,

536
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:43,740
but after that,
l'm just a spectator.

537
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:49,060
Love.

538
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:07,420
l'm looking for Nick Callahan,

539
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,780
the English doctor.

540
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:45,580
Come.

541
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:50,500
Five minutes.

542
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:12,500
Nick?

543
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:15,980
Nick, it's Sarah.

544
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:29,100
l'm going to get you
out of here.

545
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:30,740
We're going to get
out of here right now.

546
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:35,620
There's a Red Cross camp
on the border.

547
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:37,020
lt's about
four miles west of here.

548
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:38,020
We can walk it.

549
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:40,100
Damn it!

550
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:41,700

551
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:42,940
Nick, get up!

552
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:17,420
Nick? Remember?

553
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:19,300
Remember l wrote to you?

554
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:21,300
And l told you

555
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:23,460

556
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:27,620
Anna.
You remember?

557
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:30,340
You're a dad.

558
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:34,140
And she needs you.

559
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:39,620
She needs you to get up
and walk out of here.

560
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:41,380
So get up.

561
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:43,220
Get up, Nick.

562
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:13,180
That was close.

563
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:52,140
What?

564
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:54,060
We need a lot
of money to do...

565
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:56,340
lt won't be hard to track us.

566
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:47,100
-l can't make it-- go!
-You can...

567
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:48,780
Go, you've got to go.
Listen to me.

568
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:50,100
Listen to me.
Listen to me.

569
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:51,260
They're not going to kill me.

570
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:53,220
They're not going to kill me.
They need me alive.

571
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:54,220
l'm worth money to them.

572
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:56,060
lf they get you,

573
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:57,860
they will rape you,
they will kill you.

574
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:00,020
Y-You've got to go
and get help.

575
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:05,220
Okay. Okay.

576
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:04,740
Sarah!

577
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:09,820
Sarah, go!

578
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:11,900
Go! You can make it.

579
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:16,220
Go!

580
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:17,740
What are you...

581
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:19,540
What are you doing?!

582
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:21,180
For God's...

583
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:24,900
Sarah, please!

584
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:26,420
Stay. Stay.

585
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,580
Go!

586
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:32,940
l hope when
you're reading this letter,

587
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:35,740
that l'm sitting there
next to you

588
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:38,740
and you're telling me
that l'm stupid for writing it,

589
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:41,820
and crazy
for trying to find you.

590
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:44,500
But how could l not?

591
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:46,660
lt's you.

592
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:51,060
All this time,
so many years apart...

593
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:53,940
l've missed you,

594
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:57,860
but l have never been
without you.

595
00:50:57,940 --> 00:51:01,660
l've woken up with you
every morning

596
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:04,220
and gone to sleep with you
every night.

597
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:06,860
You have always been with me.

598
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:10,180
Your courage, your smile...

599
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:13,100
your damn stubbornness.

600
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:17,020
There has never been
any distance between us,

601
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:19,820
and there never will be.

602
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:23,500
l love you, Nick.

603
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:26,020
l love you.
