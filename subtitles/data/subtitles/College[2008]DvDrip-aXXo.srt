00:03:23,009 --> 00:03:23,850

65
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,901
When travel there?

66
00:06:02,141 --> 00:06:03,183
Two months ago.

67
00:06:05,185 --> 00:06:07,548
What's our
plans to be together

68
00:06:07,587 --> 00:06:08,950
And the tour to campus
this weekend

69
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:10,751
Just go without me.

70
00:06:12,192 --> 00:06:13,434
Look.

71
00:06:15,236 --> 00:06:16,036
It is the last year

72
00:06:17,438 --> 00:06:19,200
This is very exciting ...

73
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:20,842
I want a feast

74
00:06:21,242 --> 00:06:22,204
And I want to have fun

75
00:06:22,443 --> 00:06:25,647
And you ... you are not a lot of fun.

76
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:29,771
So what? Just do not take much?

77
00:06:29,811 --> 00:06:31,293
But even so we spent well.

78
00:06:32,254 --> 00:06:33,455
As our nights of Friday.

79
00:06:33,536 --> 00:06:34,737
They seem boring.

80
00:06:35,377 --> 00:06:37,459
Do our camping trips
in the schools were together?

81
00:06:37,459 --> 00:06:39,622
Studying together as nerds.

82
00:06:39,663 --> 00:06:41,263
Diego.

83
00:06:42,025 --> 00:06:42,745
Gina ...

84
00:06:42,785 --> 00:06:43,947
In the first year was one thing.

85
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:46,270
But this is me going crazy.

86
00:06:46,749 --> 00:06:48,072
Supposedly we should
fun, y. ..

87
00:06:48,671 --> 00:06:51,315
You ... You're a loser!

88
00:06:54,277 --> 00:06:55,279
Kevin was completed

89
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,243
The university is just around the
corner and I can not ruin my last year.

90
00:07:03,088 --> 00:07:03,849
This is mine.

91
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:07,293
Okay, let's see if we understand each other,

92
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:11,176
Did not you sucked?

93
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:12,297
No.

94
00:07:12,618 --> 00:07:14,099
Did not you hear me? She left me.

95
00:07:14,861 --> 00:07:15,621
I was abandoned once.

96
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:19,505
Morris you're a damn
liar, he never had a girlfriend.

97
00:07:19,825 --> 00:07:20,947
Can not shut up, sure that I had.

98
00:07:21,588 --> 00:07:22,949
Remember kev? I was introduced to one.

99
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,632
It was real, we went to
Camp physical together.

100
00:07:25,672 --> 00:07:27,874
Sure it was a freak.

101
00:07:27,994 --> 00:07:29,035
Come on, are you mind?

102
00:07:29,076 --> 00:07:30,036
We have a situation here.

103
00:07:30,077 --> 00:07:32,520
I'm going to do now,
it had everything planned.

104
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,804
Going to college together, married,
have a couple of children, a girl, a boy.

105
00:07:36,844 --> 00:07:37,524
Friend,

106
00:07:37,605 --> 00:07:40,448
That garbage you tell gina?

107
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:43,611
I leave you with good reason,
you're an idiot.

108
00:07:44,132 --> 00:07:44,933
What friends!

109
00:07:45,133 --> 00:07:45,895
How about fletcher!

110
00:07:47,696 --> 00:07:49,217
Something happens here.

111
00:07:49,257 --> 00:07:50,019
Gina left.

112
00:07:50,298 --> 00:07:50,939
It is in a crisis.

113
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:51,741
Oh, great.

114
00:07:52,341 --> 00:07:54,743
Huh, huh guys want
go out this weekend?

115
00:07:54,743 --> 00:07:56,065
I do not want to re-emerge.

116
00:07:56,265 --> 00:07:58,868
Oh, that's very bad. I went to visit
Last week my brother,

117
00:07:59,789 --> 00:08:00,749
I wanted to stay.

118
00:08:00,749 --> 00:08:03,353
As you even want to stay,
is the university.

119
00:08:03,353 --> 00:08:05,555
if it is only the university,
is what I thought.

120
00:08:05,555 --> 00:08:06,997
So I went.

121
00:08:07,077 --> 00:08:09,960
And I say at this moment is kids
they are damn few friends Stooges,

122
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,562
It is retarded.

123
00:08:11,562 --> 00:08:12,963
Why? What happened?

124
00:08:13,684 --> 00:08:14,604
You want to know?

125
00:08:17,168 --> 00:08:18,489
When I went.

126
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:20,171
Not slept for three days

127
00:08:20,171 --> 00:08:21,892
And not that I have
run out of money

128
00:08:21,933 --> 00:08:24,896
Take the card from my parents
is supposed to be for emergencies.

129
00:08:24,936 --> 00:08:27,378
I lost my cell phone that
Reality is my dad.

130
00:08:27,378 --> 00:08:29,101
And the credit card.

131
00:08:29,141 --> 00:08:31,703
But is it that I was doing.

132
00:08:31,744 --> 00:08:34,105
I drugs, driving drunk.

133
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:34,787
I got blondes.

134
00:08:34,787 --> 00:08:36,229
Brunettes.

135
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:39,512
I came in my pants,
But do not tell anyone.

136
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:40,794
I am ashamed of that.

137
00:08:40,794 --> 00:08:41,995
Two girls and me.

138
00:08:42,035 --> 00:08:44,717
With tongue with tongue.

139
00:08:44,717 --> 00:08:48,042
With snacks.

140
00:08:48,121 --> 00:08:50,124
I became a little
tattoo back down

141
00:08:50,163 --> 00:08:52,966
We do not know, it's like
a unicorn murderer.

142
00:08:53,007 --> 00:08:54,328
She looks great.

143
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:56,210
I fell in love.

144
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:59,333
Do you content that I slept with someone?

145
00:09:00,655 --> 00:09:02,016
Three times, with different girls.

146
00:09:03,818 --> 00:09:06,821
It was the best order
damn week of my life.

147
00:09:07,823 --> 00:09:10,185
Hey, they should go.

148
00:09:13,789 --> 00:09:15,952
Because we can not have a purpose
weekends as well as the fetcher.

149
00:09:16,953 --> 00:09:17,833
Oh, not to speak

150
00:09:19,035 --> 00:09:20,156
We do not even know if we
was telling the truth.

151
00:09:20,196 --> 00:09:21,838
But we can find out.

152
00:09:21,918 --> 00:09:24,240
The madness, parties, sex.

153
00:09:25,242 --> 00:09:26,442
Everything sounds incredible

154
00:09:28,165 --> 00:09:29,246
It might make me a tattoo

155
00:09:31,248 --> 00:09:32,208
Are you kidding are not they?

156
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:34,852
If that was good.

157
00:09:34,852 --> 00:09:36,654
The festivities, the drink, sex.

158
00:09:36,695 --> 00:09:38,696
If, morris I'm not kidding.

159
00:09:39,497 --> 00:09:40,819
Perhaps it is gina
reason, I am not funny.

160
00:09:40,858 --> 00:09:43,461
Learning to be fun
is what I need

161
00:09:44,022 --> 00:09:47,425
Have a crazy weekend for
gina is back with a very bad idea.

162
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:50,269
Oh ... very good
idea. We have to.

163
00:09:53,392 --> 00:09:54,113
Bitch!

164
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:58,557
They know that I leave, can also
have a weekend more fun.

165
00:09:58,638 --> 00:09:59,398
Yes!

166
00:10:02,682 --> 00:10:03,964
I am so ...

167
00:10:29,271 --> 00:10:30,913
This is definitely
better than in the brochure.

168
00:10:31,913 --> 00:10:32,875
I have a good feeling about this.

169
00:10:32,915 --> 00:10:36,158
Presentiento good, that good feeling
How we're going to have sex?

170
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,800
Because I also have this
feeling and I love it.

171
00:10:38,482 --> 00:10:40,003
I do not know friend perhaps everything.

172
00:10:40,042 --> 00:10:41,404
Let's have fun.

173
00:10:41,444 --> 00:10:43,646
That's my good friend

174
00:10:43,687 --> 00:10:47,290
Here said that the tour to
campus is at 1230 tomorrow

175
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:50,454
And there will be a warm welcome.

176
00:10:50,494 --> 00:10:51,414
Before the dinner.

177
00:10:52,336 --> 00:10:53,978
Enough, no more

178
00:10:54,058 --> 00:10:55,499
It is the agenda for the weekend!

179
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,223
No more hours now
in college now

180
00:10:58,263 --> 00:10:59,504
You know what that means?

181
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:04,549
Without parents, free beer

182
00:11:04,629 --> 00:11:06,511
And could not be better than that.

183
00:11:06,551 --> 00:11:10,356
Except ... low speed

184
00:11:10,956 --> 00:11:12,758
Hey, how are you ladies going to class?

185
00:11:13,078 --> 00:11:15,161
No, we are only
these books to a party.

186
00:11:15,562 --> 00:11:17,363
Oh, well, they are going to read, huh?

187
00:11:17,764 --> 00:11:18,644
Hallucinatory

188
00:11:19,325 --> 00:11:21,207
Well, look, let's
stay this weekend

189
00:11:21,288 --> 00:11:24,250
And wanted to know if we
wanted to teach the city.

190
00:11:24,571 --> 00:11:26,653
What college come from?

191
00:11:26,934 --> 00:11:30,778
No, not at the university,
in fact we are in high school ...

192
00:11:32,981 --> 00:11:35,183
Fucking idiot.

193
00:11:35,183 --> 00:11:36,584
We are first-year students.

194
00:11:36,744 --> 00:11:37,505
Jódanse!

195
00:11:37,585 --> 00:11:39,947
Oh, well, then I see the girls.

196
00:11:40,588 --> 00:11:41,549
Hey, nice short.

197
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:43,351
I'll give you $ 5.

198
00:11:43,391 --> 00:11:46,595
Fornico you and I let you clean my room.

199
00:11:46,675 --> 00:11:48,557
I promise you will not regret.

200
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,802
These rooms are
a garbage stink.

201
00:11:53,883 --> 00:11:57,727
Do not understand is
fourths of students.

202
00:11:58,408 --> 00:11:59,248
look

203
00:11:59,328 --> 00:12:03,173
Are you sure everything
this family legacy?

204
00:12:03,252 --> 00:12:05,174
If my parents met here.

205
00:12:06,136 --> 00:12:08,979
Guys I do not feel
so bad about this.

206
00:12:17,429 --> 00:12:18,188
What?

207
00:12:22,353 --> 00:12:23,114
I'm morris

208
00:12:24,235 --> 00:12:25,637
I am kevin

209
00:12:25,677 --> 00:12:27,159
We are the students of 1st year

210
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,922
Supposedly we are going to be
in your room this weekend.

211
00:12:30,242 --> 00:12:31,204
Oh, right.

212
00:12:33,045 --> 00:12:36,850
Look guys, I'm going to need as
20 or 30 minutes to finish here, okay?

213
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:38,570
So, come back later.

214
00:12:43,136 --> 00:12:43,857
Oh, it seems that you are exercising.

215
00:12:44,177 --> 00:12:46,580
Oh, yes, that exercising with your ...

216
00:12:50,664 --> 00:12:52,025
It's disgusting.

217
00:13:00,395 --> 00:13:01,315
Anybody can tell me
we are doing?

218
00:13:01,636 --> 00:13:02,798
Relax, it is around here.

219
00:13:03,198 --> 00:13:03,999
I think

220
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:07,602
I am not perfect these houses
all look alike to me.

221
00:13:08,124 --> 00:13:09,684
Maybe we should go back
and touch the door again.

222
00:13:10,005 --> 00:13:11,246
Shut your mouth.
Shut your mouth.

223
00:13:11,486 --> 00:13:13,408
Well, that would be good to do.

224
00:13:18,534 --> 00:13:19,255
crap

225
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:20,897
These babies.

226
00:13:20,897 --> 00:13:22,819
Psyche is good.

240
00:14:05,705 --> 00:14:08,549
I think they want to do the hard.

241
00:14:08,549 --> 00:14:10,671
When you get used.

242
00:14:11,751 --> 00:14:14,515
This slave no longer serves us.

243
00:14:14,555 --> 00:14:16,517
It's the shit friends

244

Some high school boys, they want to stay in order to be

That is a fool, remember that to your tongue?

277
00:16:39,953 --> 00:16:41,153
A loser

278

Are you looking for a party, huh?

279
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,441
Perhaps we should
mostrales where to stay.

00:16:48,482 --> 00:16:52,726
Really?
Might do with some college?

00:18:33,235 --> 00:18:33,997
Is that a rat?

300
00:18:34,477 --> 00:18:35,958
No, it was only a shadow.

301

Oh guys, do not worry, we're going to bring

Oh, here we go, ladies ...

328
00:20:17,109 --> 00:20:18,269
There are no women here, no?

329
00:20:18,469 --> 00:20:20,351

330

331
00:20:27,158 --> 00:20:28,521
What kind of holiday is this?

332
00:20:28,841 --> 00:20:31,323
Here come the big
Bright kids!

333

What is that?

334
00:20:41,414 --> 00:20:43,296
Why are we sent to that party?

335
00:20:43,936 --> 00:20:44,938
It seems gay?

336
00:20:45,338 --> 00:20:47,500
I think that farmers would have
left would have been fun.

337
00:20:49,743 --> 00:20:50,625
That was not funny can not.

off this weekend.

339
00:20:52,746 --> 00:20:53,988
Perhaps it is doing on purpose.

340
00:20:56,511 --> 00:20:59,193
Do not worry, that's not
was miorina or something.

341
00:21:01,316 --> 00:21:02,316
It was only that of him.

00:21:06,962 --> 00:21:08,564
Listen guys, that was not fun.

345
00:21:08,763 --> 00:21:11,407

Oh shit, this is crazy.

349
00:21:38,996 --> 00:21:41,199

Hey, hey. Here are friends.

353
00:22:02,022 --> 00:22:05,265
We were shit

354
00:22:05,986 --> 00:22:07,628
Yes, we believe that you are great.

355
00:22:08,028 --> 00:22:11,832
Yes, it was only a joke,
we did not want to treat them well.

356
00:22:13,434 --> 00:22:14,435
Let's do something for you.

357
00:22:14,635 --> 00:22:15,837
We're going to do some
shots in the body,

358
00:22:16,077 --> 00:22:18,959
And we would love if you
guys are with us.

359
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,601
Oh, sure it does.

360
00:22:20,842 --> 00:22:23,045
Oh really I think
that I am not going to like it.

361
00:22:23,405 --> 00:22:25,527
Yes, I too think that way.

362
00:22:26,207 --> 00:22:28,971
Oh, silly and stupid.

363
00:22:31,453 --> 00:22:34,056
Just do it man, it will be fun.

364
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,464
Okay, you know what?
Fuck, I'm inside.

365
00:22:43,546 --> 00:22:44,308
The bottle.

366
00:22:45,108 --> 00:22:46,229
This is amazing!

367
00:22:51,074 --> 00:22:52,035
Then,

368
00:22:59,885 --> 00:23:00,685

369
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:03,567
Who is this guy?

370
00:23:03,688 --> 00:23:05,170
Just in case you need it.

371
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:07,973
You guys are going to love this.

372
00:23:08,854 --> 00:23:09,655
Where were the girls?

373
00:23:10,896 --> 00:23:14,460
Fortunately the girls
went home early.

374
00:23:15,702 --> 00:23:17,904
Y. .. Where is the girl
of shots into the body?

375
00:23:18,625 --> 00:23:19,506

377
00:23:21,348 --> 00:23:23,950

taking pleasure in his place.

378
00:23:24,791 --> 00:23:25,552

I thought they wanted to have fun.

383
00:23:52,742 --> 00:23:53,702
I think we were wrong.

384
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:57,747
Returning to his room, ladies.

When you lose it.

Are you having fun?

399
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:51,360

This can not be happening.

437
00:30:32,375 --> 00:30:33,535
Are you sure this is right?

438
00:30:33,976 --> 00:30:35,138
All right.

439
00:30:35,177 --> 00:30:36,540
Relax.

440
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:38,582
Everyone is down.

441
00:30:38,621 --> 00:30:42,465
I'm never nervous
I've been with a girl.

Okay, I will be gentii.

00:34:48,692 --> 00:34:49,493

503
00:34:51,896 --> 00:34:53,217
Who is this movie?

504
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:06,231
And we arrived.

505
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:08,674
We arrived.

506
00:35:09,314 --> 00:35:11,277
You are different from
other university.

507
00:35:13,159 --> 00:35:16,042
nisiquiera I feel like one of them.

508
00:35:16,802 --> 00:35:18,084
If I can attest to that.

509
00:35:18,125 --> 00:35:19,406
But it's a good thing.

510
00:35:24,051 --> 00:35:25,413
Maybe we will see soon.

511
00:35:25,853 --> 00:35:26,573
if.

512
00:35:27,815 --> 00:35:28,576
I hope so.

513
00:35:29,176 --> 00:35:30,098
Okay, bye.

514
00:35:52,402 --> 00:35:53,723

515
00:35:54,844 --> 00:35:56,245
What do you want?

516
00:36:27,079 --> 00:36:28,640
Morris.

517
00:36:29,241 --> 00:36:30,562

if, all night.

521
00:36:44,017 --> 00:36:45,659
I'm back baby.

522
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:48,062
I can not believe it.

523
00:36:50,344 --> 00:36:51,506
Hi dad.

524
00:36:51,506 --> 00:36:52,587
Dad.

525
00:36:52,667 --> 00:36:53,788
What are you doing here?

526
00:36:53,828 --> 00:36:55,669
Morris missed the interview.

527
00:36:56,472 --> 00:36:57,993
Cagaste the scholarship.

528
00:36:58,032 --> 00:37:01,196
Everything.

529
00:37:11,606 --> 00:37:12,448
crap.

530
00:37:13,529 --> 00:37:17,013
The interview.

531
00:37:47,967 --> 00:37:49,569
Well it seems that the
Mr Hooper is not coming.

532
00:37:55,175 --> 00:37:55,975
Thank God.

533
00:37:57,697 --> 00:37:58,659
Who are still here.

534
00:37:58,698 --> 00:38:00,300
Sorry for being late.

535
00:38:04,986 --> 00:38:07,347
After the mine this bronze statue.

536
00:38:07,347 --> 00:38:10,631
Hero of the general w. S fielmod

537

Secrets of the eavesdroppers.

538
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:18,880
arljam is finished

539
00:38:19,681 --> 00:38:20,882
my parents no longer support me.

540
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:22,685
nisiquiera me dicuenta.

541
00:38:23,205 --> 00:38:24,286
Did not you noticed?

542
00:38:24,846 --> 00:38:25,768
Micara did you see?

543
00:38:27,609 --> 00:38:29,291
if this joke was great.

544
00:38:30,012 --> 00:38:32,455
As a baby, say goodbye to that scholarship.

545
00:38:32,495 --> 00:38:33,777
It goes on with your life.

546
00:38:33,777 --> 00:38:35,097
Where the hell is kevin

547
00:38:35,137 --> 00:38:37,541
It should be here,
is the tour to the campus.

548
00:38:38,061 --> 00:38:39,221
Should have had something last night.

549
00:38:40,664 --> 00:38:41,785
Or dead.

550
00:38:41,865 --> 00:38:44,187
Do not you think that something bad
he has gone right?

551
00:38:44,748 --> 00:38:46,870
It is the university that can happen here

552
00:39:08,734 --> 00:39:10,095
You look good

553
00:39:10,135 --> 00:39:12,698
More belludo what I thought.

554
00:39:20,747 --> 00:39:22,109
beautiful, beautiful.

555
00:39:27,554 --> 00:39:31,398
if this is embarrassing, sinisiquiera
I micarne of DENTIFICATION

556
00:39:31,959 --> 00:39:33,401
Who did this?

557
00:39:33,401 --> 00:39:35,443
Those of another group.

558
00:39:35,443 --> 00:39:37,444
¿Micarro truth about this?

559
00:39:46,214 --> 00:39:48,177
- Why do not we go home?
- We 're not going anywhere

560
00:39:48,217 --> 00:39:49,579
- Not yet.
- Why not?

561
00:39:49,619 --> 00:39:51,180
What are you trying to prove?

562
00:39:51,221 --> 00:39:52,581
Do not try to prove anything.

563
00:39:54,024 --> 00:39:54,984
I try to have fun.

564
00:39:55,105 --> 00:39:57,427
That is, I love the new kevin.

565
00:39:57,787 --> 00:39:58,949
Pasandola Are they right?

566
00:39:58,989 --> 00:40:00,270
Return to your home.

567
00:40:00,349 --> 00:40:02,112
It could have been worse.

568
00:40:02,752 --> 00:40:05,435
That may be worse to spend the whole
night tethered to a naked statue.

569
00:40:06,036 --> 00:40:08,358
Look for super gina.

570
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,681
Super boobs

571
00:40:21,213 --> 00:40:22,695
Do not worry about messages
nisiquiera that submission.

572
00:40:22,774 --> 00:40:23,495
They know that ...

573
00:40:24,536 --> 00:40:25,217
MOUNT I have no other concerns.

574
00:40:25,257 --> 00:40:26,379
Really?

575
00:40:26,419 --> 00:40:29,781
In that case, let
a feast for kevin.

576
00:40:29,822 --> 00:40:31,784
Leave it.

577
00:40:34,788 --> 00:40:36,550
Come morris preocuaparte both stops.

578
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:39,192
Maybe it is the best.

579
00:40:39,232 --> 00:40:40,834
As you can tell who is the best.

580
00:40:40,873 --> 00:40:43,156
Why siestuvieras at home,
know exactly what happen.

581
00:40:43,156 --> 00:40:46,479
situs parents you would have broken the
shit ass for the interview.

582
00:40:47,401 --> 00:40:50,084
Now you will have the opportunity to talk
with the principal and explain what happened

583
00:40:51,606 --> 00:40:52,406
You think that to work?

584
00:40:52,927 --> 00:40:54,048
It is worth trying.

585
00:40:54,088 --> 00:40:55,370
What have you got to lose?

586
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:58,213
You could do that
china you masturbate more.

587
00:40:59,935 --> 00:41:02,337
I think definitely
volveras to see that.

588
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:34,212
By the way ...

589
00:41:34,212 --> 00:41:37,936
... I think I soiled much last night.

590
00:41:46,225 --> 00:41:48,307
They are more collegial
hard of what I thought.

591
00:41:48,347 --> 00:41:50,629
have balls Citadines.

592
00:41:56,235 --> 00:41:58,398
sons of a bitch.

593
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:03,764
It is a charity.

594
00:42:03,844 --> 00:42:05,886
And we have very good service.

595
00:42:05,926 --> 00:42:07,568
Does Ganial naked?

596
00:42:08,248 --> 00:42:11,012
this is not good foxes
it is time to socialize.

597
00:42:12,093 --> 00:42:13,014
I think you better go.

598
00:42:13,454 --> 00:42:17,299
if, perhaps having more
Fortunately sicompran beers.

599
00:42:17,979 --> 00:42:18,981
What is that?

600
00:42:19,021 --> 00:42:20,541
A bar, go to bars right?

601
00:42:23,625 --> 00:42:25,868
¿Bars? sitodo time.
- Every day.

602
00:42:26,909 --> 00:42:27,790
I am always in bars.

603
00:42:29,312 --> 00:42:30,433
Just make sure you bring this kid

604
00:42:31,354 --> 00:42:32,034
Is this guy?

605
00:42:32,114 --> 00:42:33,156
Me?

606
00:42:33,195 --> 00:42:34,117
Yes, you.

607
00:42:34,597 --> 00:42:37,040
I ca ste well.

608
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,282
Me?

609
00:42:41,164 --> 00:42:43,126
See you guys.

610
00:42:45,489 --> 00:42:47,972
I was thinking that maybe ...

611
00:42:48,692 --> 00:42:49,894
We could continue what last night.

612
00:42:49,894 --> 00:42:53,337
Maybe, just about
find a better place.

613
00:42:56,981 --> 00:42:58,824
God save beautiful boobs.

614
00:43:02,067 --> 00:43:02,828
yes, yes.

615
00:43:02,867 --> 00:43:04,310
The vere at one and ten.

616
00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:05,671
I love your tits.

617
00:43:05,751 --> 00:43:07,193
Worth as $ 9000.

618
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:08,714
Seriously.

619
00:43:08,754 --> 00:43:10,476
As they are friends.

620
00:43:11,357 --> 00:43:15,002
Kevin sees you as well last night.

621
00:43:17,403 --> 00:43:18,725
if your partner also.

622
00:43:19,526 --> 00:43:21,808
I suppose that you painted micarro.

623
00:43:27,334 --> 00:43:28,495
So it will be companions?

624
00:43:28,495 --> 00:43:29,376
It was just a button.

625
00:43:29,417 --> 00:43:32,981
- Have a job yet.
- What kind of work?

626
00:43:34,582 --> 00:43:35,463
It is not the big thing.

627
00:43:35,543 --> 00:43:38,106
We just need to clean up
the house for a feast.

628
00:43:38,106 --> 00:43:41,309
Maybe wash micarro, you know
as I like to have it clean.

629
00:43:42,751 --> 00:43:45,553
Where do I put the keys?

630
00:43:55,564 --> 00:43:56,486
hell, no.

631
00:43:57,287 --> 00:43:58,768
Do I hear some hostility?

632
00:43:58,808 --> 00:43:59,850
Are you serious?

633
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:02,653
Not believing that living here was free.

634
00:44:02,693 --> 00:44:04,414
Do not clean your
house, no way.

635
00:44:05,174 --> 00:44:08,939
Well, maybe you like your love
know who are still in high school.

636
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:11,423
Will not know unless you tell.

637
00:44:11,423 --> 00:44:14,225
Well, but clean the house,
maybe it has DIOT.

638
00:44:15,867 --> 00:44:16,908
A working guys.

639
00:44:18,389 --> 00:44:19,712
Tomas keys.

640
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:28,400
Kevin.

641
00:44:28,961 --> 00:44:29,882
Kevin

642
00:44:31,123 --> 00:44:32,404
Dont waste your time with it.

643
00:44:32,404 --> 00:44:34,567
Not believing that you're the only one.

644
00:44:34,648 --> 00:44:36,409
Or do we?

645
00:44:36,449 --> 00:44:38,051
You are a fucking sick.

646
00:44:44,819 --> 00:44:47,381
Do we have to clean?

647
00:44:47,501 --> 00:44:49,904
I think this weekend
we have to take advantage of it.

648
00:46:34,016 --> 00:46:35,779
It's very funny.

649
00:46:35,818 --> 00:46:39,662
That I spent the whole day
and cleaning up your mess and get everything.

650
00:46:40,063 --> 00:46:42,425
To me that ruin everything.

651
00:46:43,267 --> 00:46:45,829
I love this, you are so DIOT.

652
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:49,193
Get out of here.

653
00:46:58,844 --> 00:47:00,085
No hiss is a good village.

654
00:47:00,846 --> 00:47:02,488
Come on, is your scholarship is not it?

655
00:47:04,290 --> 00:47:05,250
Come

656
00:47:09,695 --> 00:47:10,897
Come on, you can do.

657
00:47:10,976 --> 00:47:12,299
I trust you.

658
00:47:13,259 --> 00:47:14,581
Lucky brother.

659
00:47:14,981 --> 00:47:17,543
- It is a DIOT.
- Absolutely.

660
00:47:19,626 --> 00:47:21,108
Time running.

661
00:47:22,069 --> 00:47:24,311
Just say that this morning is

662
00:47:26,073 --> 00:47:27,475
Very shocked.

663
00:47:28,275 --> 00:47:30,678
We did not know that
meant those words.

664
00:47:31,559 --> 00:47:33,161
I searched on the Internet.

665
00:47:33,241 --> 00:47:35,042
But I guess that's what happens ...

666
00:47:35,083 --> 00:47:37,325
When you decide to stay in
fraternity house

667
00:47:37,325 --> 00:47:40,128
Instead of the bedroom
we attach.

668
00:47:41,049 --> 00:47:41,810
I know sir.

669
00:47:42,491 --> 00:47:43,692
It was a bad choice.

670
00:47:43,732 --> 00:47:45,174
sidependiera me.

671
00:47:45,254 --> 00:47:48,337
Botaria to each member of the
fraternity of the university.

672
00:47:48,337 --> 00:47:51,260
Know that these animals.

673
00:47:51,301 --> 00:47:55,145
Smelled of the drug balloons
just to get tough.

674
00:47:56,305 --> 00:47:57,267
Really?

675
00:47:58,148 --> 00:47:59,269
It's horrible.

676
00:48:01,511 --> 00:48:02,553
Mr Hooper.

677
00:48:03,313 --> 00:48:05,916
There is no doubt that it is an academic genius.

678
00:48:06,517 --> 00:48:08,759
But the scholarship that we give here.

679
00:48:08,759 --> 00:48:11,282
It is much more than that.

680
00:48:11,762 --> 00:48:13,565
Lord and me.

681
00:48:14,805 --> 00:48:16,808
mifamilia has a large
history at this university.

682
00:48:17,488 --> 00:48:19,370
I would like to continue that legacy.

683
00:48:19,451 --> 00:48:21,734
boy, I think you're going to
having to prove that.

684
00:48:21,774 --> 00:48:24,176
Mr Hooper.

685
00:48:24,257 --> 00:48:27,379
You and your scholarship is
hanging by a thread.

686
00:48:33,506 --> 00:48:34,787
You are so DIOT

687
00:48:36,189 --> 00:48:37,991
Where have you been it's time to leave

688
00:48:37,991 --> 00:48:39,233
Relax, relax.

689
00:48:39,313 --> 00:48:41,995
I have been on the internet.

690
00:48:42,997 --> 00:48:43,878
They are the dentifer.

691
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:47,521
That is mimuchacho.

692
00:48:49,163 --> 00:48:50,604
Great, what do you pass mill?

693
00:48:52,166 --> 00:48:53,608
What happens?

694
00:48:54,209 --> 00:48:55,530
As questions that kevin

695
00:48:56,210 --> 00:48:57,492
You forget how it feels?

696
00:48:57,572 --> 00:48:58,974
You understand.

697
00:48:59,014 --> 00:49:00,455
What are we going to do?

698
00:49:00,535 --> 00:49:02,377
I want to go from here.

699
00:49:03,018 --> 00:49:05,421
There's nothing you can do tonight.

700
00:49:05,421 --> 00:49:07,422
So let's have fun, take.

701
00:49:08,224 --> 00:49:09,425
nisiquiera looks like me.

702
00:49:09,425 --> 00:49:11,787
dam you're not photogenic.

703
00:49:14,631 --> 00:49:16,233
It's worth it.

704
00:49:16,313 --> 00:49:18,195
You are so ugly.

705
00:49:18,835 --> 00:49:20,877
Ugly, you will feel better.

706
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:24,201
Lecuisa.

707
00:49:24,841 --> 00:49:27,524
Do you really think I
lecuisa call you drink?

708
00:49:29,286 --> 00:49:32,730
You know what, 10 U.S. dollars entry.

709
00:49:35,534 --> 00:49:36,254
crap.

710
00:49:36,775 --> 00:49:39,057
No money is not based on the monkey.

711
00:49:40,498 --> 00:49:41,780
Let the babies go to.

712
00:49:44,183 --> 00:49:45,384
What was that, not the check.

713
00:49:45,425 --> 00:49:47,146
saw the size of that.

714
00:49:49,188 --> 00:49:50,269
No.

715
00:49:50,349 --> 00:49:52,792
Hombrezote.

716
00:49:53,433 --> 00:49:55,195
Crammed not want.

717
00:49:55,875 --> 00:49:56,797
I said no.

718
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:02,362
As it is not smooth.

719
00:50:02,402 --> 00:50:05,205
We do not have very good
this weekend.

720
00:50:05,245 --> 00:50:06,607
We're not inside.

721
00:50:07,648 --> 00:50:09,890
Do they think that well when we
we are in college?

722
00:50:10,652 --> 00:50:11,612
Who knows.

723
00:50:12,373 --> 00:50:13,695
Maybe we are not together.

724
00:50:14,134 --> 00:50:15,016
That I know.

725
00:50:15,056 --> 00:50:18,620
You look like a baby that
please do not you shut up.

726
00:50:19,181 --> 00:50:20,102
It is true.

727

00:50:20,102 --> 00:50:21,302
Think of this.

728
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:22,704
It was over.

729
00:50:22,704 --> 00:50:23,905
Last year of college.

730
00:50:25,827 --> 00:50:26,628
is right, it was over.

731
00:50:27,831 --> 00:50:29,993
One more reason to take advantage
that we are here.

732
00:50:30,633 --> 00:50:31,634
Rather than sit here, let's go.

733
00:50:31,674 --> 00:50:32,555
Where are you going?

734
00:50:32,635 --> 00:50:34,317
To think where we have a
Feast of the fraternity.

735
00:50:34,917 --> 00:50:36,279
And the girls?

736
00:50:41,885 --> 00:50:42,966
Get up Morris.

737
00:50:43,687 --> 00:50:45,290
Esperenme.

738
00:50:45,329 --> 00:50:46,410
You look like a turtle.

739
00:51:53,363 --> 00:51:54,123
Where is michompa?

740
00:51:55,365 --> 00:51:57,287
Want to climb?

741
00:52:32,365 --> 00:52:34,047
What do these children here.

742
00:52:34,047 --> 00:52:35,488
There is.

743
00:52:35,568 --> 00:52:39,412
I want you to know ladies
some very special guests.

744
00:52:40,253 --> 00:52:41,054
Hi guys.

745
00:52:41,054 --> 00:52:42,015
Hello.

746
00:52:43,497 --> 00:52:44,538
Me?

747
00:52:45,259 --> 00:52:47,021
- Hello.
- It is up to a year.

748
00:52:49,223 --> 00:52:50,704
And you are ... which TAPO with feathers.

749
00:52:50,785 --> 00:52:54,629
Are great.

750
00:52:56,430 --> 00:52:57,392
Where we were

751
00:52:58,433 --> 00:53:00,475
Where we were, where we were.

752
00:53:03,679 --> 00:53:04,480
if, indeed, ladies.

753
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:07,123
These guys are
nice enough.

754
00:53:07,203 --> 00:53:08,804
And paid for all this.

755
00:53:08,844 --> 00:53:10,486
Is that what you did
with our money?

756
00:53:10,566 --> 00:53:11,488
¿Paid this party?

757
00:53:11,528 --> 00:53:13,450
Things are expensive companion.

758
00:53:14,210 --> 00:53:16,092
Look around you.

759
00:53:16,092 --> 00:53:19,136
We have no money or
in for our wallets.

760
00:53:19,216 --> 00:53:20,177
- Yes.
- If

761
00:53:20,496 --> 00:53:21,778
What about that?

762
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:24,983
Fortunately remained.

763
00:53:25,022 --> 00:53:26,905
I believe it will have an emergency.

764
00:53:26,984 --> 00:53:28,506
That we would like

765
00:53:28,506 --> 00:53:30,227
We have good folks.

766
00:53:30,267 --> 00:53:31,549
Especially.

767
00:53:32,511 --> 00:53:33,912
Hi troy.

768
00:53:39,557 --> 00:53:41,239
Why did you hit me?

769
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:42,881
Shut up bitch.

770
00:53:43,722 --> 00:53:45,323
What is wrong with that.

771
00:53:45,723 --> 00:53:48,247
It was that kind of village. I like psyche.

772
00:53:49,167 --> 00:53:53,052
Buenos we have to go
to continue socializing.

773
00:53:54,334 --> 00:53:55,736
Have fun.

774
00:53:57,938 --> 00:53:58,739
Nenas.

775
00:53:59,338 --> 00:54:03,143
I'm so horny.

776
00:54:03,584 --> 00:54:06,627
Did you see the size of that?

777
00:54:07,909 --> 00:54:09,350
Basically it is our party.

778
00:54:09,350 --> 00:54:12,353
if, as I see it agree.

779
00:54:12,393 --> 00:54:13,715
I think so.

780
00:54:13,715 --> 00:54:14,515
I do not know.

781
00:54:14,556 --> 00:54:16,918
Come on, siya pay for it
we must enjoy it less.

782
00:54:17,359 --> 00:54:18,400
That is mimuchacho.

783
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:19,521
Come on.

784
00:54:20,763 --> 00:54:21,924
Esperenme.

785
00:54:26,969 --> 00:54:27,930
Have you ever done this?

786
00:54:27,970 --> 00:54:29,492
But it is not fun, is it not?
- If

787
00:54:29,531 --> 00:54:30,773
Very funny, all right.

788
00:54:30,813 --> 00:54:32,375
Go get a ticket.

789
00:54:32,375 --> 00:54:34,778
I do not want to send more messages.

790
00:54:35,378 --> 00:54:37,100
He changed his mind

791
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:38,422
Kevin please.

792
00:54:38,502 --> 00:54:39,702
What's going on?

793
00:54:39,743 --> 00:54:41,064
You do not have to do this.

794
00:54:42,986 --> 00:54:45,068
if, and you should
try once a year.

795
00:54:45,109 --> 00:54:46,350
Marica

796
00:54:46,911 --> 00:54:49,353
Me? No, it's bad village.

797
00:54:49,353 --> 00:54:51,716
I had a lot.

798
00:54:53,557 --> 00:54:56,121
You know what, I think I will go to search

799
00:54:56,161 --> 00:54:57,522
Without something to drink alcohol.

800
00:54:57,561 --> 00:54:59,725
There must be something in the frigider.

801
00:54:59,765 --> 00:55:01,967
We love you, but you better watch.

802
00:55:02,688 --> 00:55:03,889
- Well,
- Let's do this.

803
00:55:06,372 --> 00:55:08,454
Be careful with friends.

804
00:55:08,534 --> 00:55:10,816
Bitches to talk, bitches speaking.

805
00:55:23,030 --> 00:55:24,712
Is there alcohol there?

806
00:55:24,751 --> 00:55:26,073
In the punch?

807
00:55:26,755 --> 00:55:29,677
No, nothing like that.

808
00:55:29,757 --> 00:55:32,881
It is a drink alcohol.

809
00:55:32,961 --> 00:55:34,723
Know your new neighborhood.

810
00:55:35,404 --> 00:55:36,445
Really?

811
00:55:36,485 --> 00:55:38,607
The girls will bother you.

812
00:55:39,408 --> 00:55:41,010
After that abandon.

813
00:55:43,852 --> 00:55:44,653
but I think ...

814
00:55:45,414 --> 00:55:47,056
Make a toast.

815
00:55:49,458 --> 00:55:50,500
Can you give me a little punch?

816
00:55:51,221 --> 00:55:52,822
The first thirsty.

817
00:55:53,862 --> 00:55:55,224
Other driver murderer.

818
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:00,870
That's very good.

819
00:56:00,911 --> 00:56:02,433
sirvete compañero.

820
00:56:02,433 --> 00:56:04,235
You look thirsty.

821
00:56:04,274 --> 00:56:05,997
Thank you

822
00:56:06,597 --> 00:56:08,279

830
00:56:29,902 --> 00:56:30,782

Is a loser.

837
00:56:48,723 --> 00:56:51,685
Do you really are you so jealous?

838
00:56:52,807 --> 00:56:56,091
Give thanks to God that you are alive.

839
00:57:06,702 --> 00:57:07,904
I want to take, I want a little.

840
00:57:08,504 --> 00:57:09,866
That's right.

841
00:57:12,509 --> 00:57:15,151

924
01:02:40,464 --> 01:02:42,226
Want to tell more lies?

925
01:02:42,906 --> 01:02:43,867
No thanks

926
01:02:43,867 --> 01:02:45,830

928
01:02:49,674 --> 01:02:51,996
I thought you were different

929
01:02:52,077 --> 01:02:53,839

The only thing I wanted was a
college is much to ask?

936
01:03:16,103 --> 01:03:17,144

01:04:08,759 --> 01:04:10,762

1014
01:10:06,067 --> 01:10:09,910
vine aquintentando cambiar quien era

1015
01:10:10,912 --> 01:10:12,914
Because not only was part of this

1016
01:10:13,594 --> 01:10:14,516
I thought you were brilliant

1017
01:10:14,556 --> 01:10:15,798
Why you want to change it?

1018
01:10:15,838 --> 01:10:16,878
Not

1019
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:19,441
Do not know?

1020
01:10:20,523 --> 01:10:24,367
Is who I am or what I knew

1021
01:10:25,127 --> 01:10:27,329
Occasionally he was responsible

1022
01:10:31,574 --> 01:10:33,216
In truth ruin this weekend

1023
01:10:34,258 --> 01:10:37,822
Now both are
and also angry with me

1024
01:10:40,985 --> 01:10:43,988
You look like the kind of
people who do not make a mistake

1025
01:10:47,992 --> 01:10:48,954
A couple of weeks ago

1026
01:10:49,434 --> 01:10:50,956
Hold

1027
01:10:52,837 --> 01:10:54,439
I slept with ten

1028
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,161
It was a mistake

1029
01:10:56,201 --> 01:10:57,603
sipuedes decirme

1030
01:10:59,164 --> 01:11:01,647
Why not tell everything

1031
01:11:03,489 --> 01:11:05,251
Why did

1032
01:11:05,371 --> 01:11:07,573
Ie as a kid like jess

1033
01:11:08,053 --> 01:11:09,455
For all the wrong reasons

1034
01:11:10,817 --> 01:11:12,579
Still looking

1035
01:11:12,579 --> 01:11:14,181
He made me feel special

1036
01:11:15,422 --> 01:11:17,464
And as good liar

1037
01:11:17,905 --> 01:11:21,789
He made me believe something that was
rather than something one night

1038
01:11:27,234 --> 01:11:28,276
si

1039
01:11:28,796 --> 01:11:32,240

01:11:34,003 --> 01:11:36,204
I learned that the liars and

1041
01:11:36,285 --> 01:11:38,566

1042

1043
01:11:44,453 --> 01:11:45,814

1044
01:11:49,258 --> 01:11:50,619
Kevin is the real one who speaks?

1045
01:11:51,061 --> 01:11:54,664
Or is the improved
kevin speaking university?

01:18:25,007 --> 01:18:25,848
What the fuck?

1108
01:18:26,248 --> 01:18:27,010
What is it?

1109
01:18:27,450 --> 01:18:28,651
That you see the wick was extinguished

1110
01:18:53,678 --> 01:18:54,399

1111
01:18:57,442 --> 01:18:59,084
What the fuck

1112
01:19:27,195 --> 01:19:27,996
Oh shit

1113
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:34,162

1114
01:19:39,768 --> 01:19:40,770

It seems better to quit
have fire next door or something

1121
01:20:38,993 --> 01:20:39,713
Accursed

1126
01:21:00,014 --> 01:21:02,138
disturbando la paz
destroying property

1127
01:21:02,138 --> 01:21:03,419
Stealing animals

1128
01:21:03,499 --> 01:21:05,501
What the hell is this? We are not

1129
01:21:08,625 --> 01:21:09,906

Oficial nisiquiera venimos aqui

1131
01:21:13,430 --> 01:21:14,831
We are only a handful of college

1132
01:21:14,871 --> 01:21:17,955
Frankly I am ashamed
their behavior

1133
01:21:18,555 --> 01:21:19,597
hijos de puta!

1134
01:21:22,119 --> 01:21:24,802
Relax friend got something on your nipple

1135
01:21:26,084 --> 01:21:27,244
Wait!

1136
01:21:28,967 --> 01:21:30,048
Dónde esta miauto?

1137
01:21:30,568 --> 01:21:32,531
Dónde esta mimaldito auto?

1138
01:21:56,997 --> 01:21:59,000
So you go to college?

1139
01:21:59,079 --> 01:22:02,363
si, sólo vine para tener
one week you

1140
01:22:02,844 --> 01:22:04,926
But we thought you were a university

1141
01:22:04,965 --> 01:22:06,928
Really? Thank you

1142
01:22:09,250 --> 01:22:11,733
And I guess that's it uh?

1143
01:22:12,174 --> 01:22:14,216
Therefore need not be

1144
01:22:16,938 --> 01:22:17,699
Stronger

1145
01:22:20,783 --> 01:22:22,505
Take tiger

1146
01:22:29,593 --> 01:22:31,313
I guess that ...

1147
01:22:36,119 --> 01:22:37,401
And again next year?

1148
01:22:38,922 --> 01:22:41,205
After this week
I think I did

1149
01:22:42,246 --> 01:22:45,170
Además tengo novia asique

1150
01:22:45,690 --> 01:22:46,411
A yes?

1151
01:22:46,490 --> 01:22:47,292
Who is it?

1152
01:22:48,974 --> 01:22:50,174
Someone who knew

1153
01:22:51,216 --> 01:22:53,058
It's pretty clear

1154
01:22:54,179 --> 01:22:57,343
So I guess that
there will be a photo session

1155
01:23:17,964 --> 01:23:19,046
That's all

1156
01:23:19,526 --> 01:23:20,928
I think we arrived at the track

1157
01:23:21,368 --> 01:23:22,450
Grab this

1158
01:23:32,381 --> 01:23:34,183
Ok guys go home

1159
01:23:47,918 --> 01:23:49,479
Here come the problems

1160
01:23:49,919 --> 01:23:50,720
Hey kevin

1161
01:23:52,081 --> 01:23:52,842
Gina

1162
01:23:53,243 --> 01:23:55,446
I get your message on video

1163
01:23:55,926 --> 01:23:58,128
It seems that tubieron
a crazy weekend

1164
01:23:58,729 --> 01:23:59,570
Sure!

1165
01:24:01,572 --> 01:24:03,094
We leave in peace

1166
01:24:05,376 --> 01:24:06,578
Anyway

1167
01:24:08,339 --> 01:24:12,143
I thought a lot about you and me

1168
01:24:13,705 --> 01:24:15,467
In us

1169
01:24:15,507 --> 01:24:19,151
I would think that the break never happened

1170
01:24:21,154 --> 01:24:23,316
Well

1171
01:24:29,401 --> 01:24:30,163
I do not think so

1172
01:24:32,165 --> 01:24:33,326
What?

1173
01:24:34,328 --> 01:24:35,649
I have advanced

1174
01:24:37,410 --> 01:24:38,532
Move on?

1175
01:24:39,013 --> 01:24:40,935
We have not seen in three days

1176
01:24:41,415 --> 01:24:43,177
Many things happen in three days

1177
01:24:45,861 --> 01:24:48,102
Gina that guy you saw

1178
01:24:48,743 --> 01:24:50,865
I was not

1179
01:24:53,067 --> 01:24:53,909
See you

1180
01:24:54,069 --> 01:24:56,351
And good breasts

1181
01:24:58,954 --> 01:25:00,156
Kevin hopes

1182
01:25:01,357 --> 01:25:02,558
Is seriously

1183
01:25:07,363 --> 01:25:09,525

Next week? Not

1185
01:25:12,770 --> 01:25:13,690
Forget it

1186
01:25:13,770 --> 01:25:15,652
I can sneak

1187
01:25:17,374 --> 01:25:21,178
