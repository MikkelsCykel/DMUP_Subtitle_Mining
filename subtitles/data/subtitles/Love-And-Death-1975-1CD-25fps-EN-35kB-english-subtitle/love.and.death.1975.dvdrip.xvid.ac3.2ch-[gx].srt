1
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,632
How I got into this predicament,
I'll never know.

2
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,716
Absolutely incredible.

3
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,116
To be executed for a crime
I never committed.

4
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,879
Of course,
isn't all mankind in the same boat?

5
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,629
Isn't all mankind ultimately executed
for a crime it never committed?

6
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,594
The difference is
that all men go eventually,

7
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,915
but I go six o'clock tomorrow morning.

8
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,397
I was supposed to go at fýve o'clock,
but I have a smart lawyer. Got leniency.

9
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,434
I've a tremendous yearning
to be young again.

10
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:13,112
A boy. Such happy memories
at our summer house.

11
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,038
Uncle Nikolai with his wonderful laugh.

12
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,157
God, he was repulsive.

13
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,590
There was Grandpa and Grandma,
who had been married for 50 years

14
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:33,315
and still felt as deeply about one another
as the day they met.

15
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:38,191
And my own father,
a handsome and generous man.

16
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:42,677
In addition to our summer and winter
estate, he owned a valuable piece of land.

17
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,635
True, it was a small piece. But he carried
it with him wherever he went.

18
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,515
Dimitri Pietrovich!
I would like to buy your land.

19
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,438
This land is not for sale.

20
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,189
Some day, I hope to build on it.

21
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,834
He was an idiot. But I loved him.

22
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:05,476
Then there was mother, who made
the most delicious blintzes in the world.

23
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,992
Of course, there was Old Gregor,
and his son, Young Gregor.

24
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,793
Young Gregor's son
was older than Old Gregor.

25
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,798
Nobody could fýgure out
how that happened.

26
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,629
My two brothers, lvan and Mikhail,
used to play amusing little games.

27
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,070
But I had a completely different
concept of myself as a child.

28
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:31,390
My fýrst experience with death
was with one of our serfs, Old Nehamkin.

29
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:36,556
Old Nehamkin was on the roof, putting up
a lightning rod, when a storm broke out.

30
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,551
After he failed to show up for dinner,
Mother went to look for him.

31
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,195
What is it, Old Nehamkin?
You're not looking well.

32
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,198
Are you OK? You feel all right?

33
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,636
We laid Old Nehamkin to rest,

34
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,433
and that night
I had a strange and vivid dream.

35
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:20,151
I knew that after that dream I would
not grow up to be an ordinary man.

36
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,350
I spoke often with Father Nikolai,

37
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,199
who was always dressed in black
with a black beard.

38
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,675
For years
I thought he was an Italian widow.

39
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,873
Every action has a cause. The universe
exists, therefore it has a cause.

40
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,151
It follows God created the universe,
therefore He exists.

41
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,078
And yet Spinoza didn't believe
in the Holy Trinity.

42
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,236
- Spinoza was a Jew.
- What's a Jew?

43
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,148
You never saw a Jew?
Here. I have some sketches.

44
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,269
- There are Jews.
- No kidding.

45
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,075
- They all have these horns?
- No, this is the Russian Jew.

46
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,668
The German Jew has these stripes.

47
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,234
I recall my fýrst mystical vision.

48
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,749
I was in the woods, thinking about Christ.

49
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,429
If He was a carpenter, I wondered
what He'd charge for book shelves?

50
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,959
Suddenly...

51
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,916
- Who are you?
- Death.

52
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,471
What happens after we die?

53
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,160
Is there a hell? Is there a God?

54
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,356
Do we live again?

55
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,916
All right. Let me ask one key question.

56
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:25,833
- Are there girls?
- You're an interesting young man.

57
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,757
We'll meet again.

58
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,474
- Don't bother.
- It's no bother.

59
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,118
I grew to full manhood.
Actually, fýve foot six,

60
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:39,279
which is technically not full manhood
in Russia, but you can own property.

61
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,672
Over 5'3", you can own land. Under 5'3",
you need permission from the Tsar.

62
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,590
We were three healthy men.

63
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,676
My brother lvan.

64
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,996
My brother Mikhail.

65
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,796
And myself.

66
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,915
Finally, there was my cousin Sonja.

67
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:29,430
In addition to being the most beautiful
woman I had ever seen,

68
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:33,758
she was one of the few people
I could have deep conversations with.

69
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,275
Boris, look at this leaf. Isn't it perfect?

70
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,950
And this one? Look.

71
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:45,596
Oh, yeah. I definitely think that
this is the best of all possible worlds.

72
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,349
- It's certainly the most expensive.
- Isn't nature incredible?

73
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:54,115
To me, nature is... I dunno,
spiders and bugs and,

74
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,196
big fish eating little fish.

75
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,790
And plants eating plants
and animals eating...

76
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,876
It's like an enormous restaurant.

77
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,958
Yes, but if God created it,
it has to be beautiful,

78
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,753
even if His plan's not apparent
to us at the moment.

79
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,189
Sonja, what if there is no God?

80
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,675
Boris Dimitrovitch, are you joking?

81
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,314
What if we're just
a bunch of absurd people

82
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,079
who are running around
with no rhyme or reason?

83
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,839
But if there is no God,
then life has no meaning.

84
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,838
Why go on living?
Why not just commit suicide?

85
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,679
Well, let's not get hysterical.
I could be wrong.

86
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,837
I'd hate to blow my brains out,
then see they found something.

87
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,111
Boris. Let me show you
how absurd your position is.

88
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:38,031
Let's say there is no God, and each man
is free to do exactly as he chooses.

89
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,720
What prevents you
from murdering somebody?

90
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:44,116
- Murder's immoral.
- Immorality is subjective.

91
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,356
Yes, but subjectivity is objective.

92
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,916
Not in a rational scheme of perception.

93
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,429
Perception is irrational.
It implies imminence.

94
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:55,314
But judgment of any system
of phenomena exists

95
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,989
in any rational, metaphysical or
epistemological contradiction

96
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,591
to an abstracted empirical concept
such as being, or to be, or to occur

97
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,075
in the thing itself, or of the thing itself.

98
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,111
Yeah, I've said that many times.

99
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,676
Boris, we must believe in God.

100
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:16,034
If I could just see a miracle,
just one miracle.

101
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,597
If I could see a burning bush,
or the seas part, or...

102
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,393
Or my Uncle Sasha pick up a check.

103
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,832
We should go back downstairs.

104
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,719
By now
the last golden streaks of the sunset

105
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,673
are vanishing behind the western hills.

106
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,952
Soon the dark blanket of night
shall settle over us all.

107
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,470
Hey, you've been going
to finishing school.

108
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:46,719
Hey, are you dating any Russians
I should know about?

109
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,790
Well, Minskov has proposed.

110
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,876
And he's very sweet and wealthy.

111
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,117
But the age difference is too great.
I'm 28 and he's 81.

112
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:59,518
- Oh, that is big.
- When I'm 50, he'll be 103.

113
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,596
That's a bad age for a man. They slow up.

114
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,075
And Voskovec
has made his intentions clear.

115
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,873
But he deals in herring,
and he always smells of it.

116
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,355
He even bought me
herring-scented cologne.

117
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,948
That's probably
why the cat follows you around.

118
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,991
Love is everything, Boris.

119
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,351
I wanna meet some man
and scale the heights of passion.

120
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:21,029
Some man who embodies
the three great aspects of love.

121
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,755
Intellectual, spiritual and sensual.

122
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,839
Well, there's not too many of us
around, but it can be done.

123
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,756
- So many women settle cheaply.
- I know. Poor things.

124
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,997
- They marry for money.
- Money! Well, money.

125
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,793
But I feel as though
my life would be wasted

126
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:42,356
if I didn't love deeply
with a man whose mind I respected,

127
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,596
whose spirituality equalled mine,

128
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,439
and who had the same lustful appetite

129
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,393
for sensual passion that drives me insane.

130
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,229
You're an incredibly complex woman.

131
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:57,429
I guess you could say
I'm half saint, half whore.

132
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,916
Here's hoping I get the half that eats.

133
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,837
- Boris.
- Yes?

134
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,110
I have a confession to make.

135
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,756
Ever since you and I were little children,

136
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,189
I've been in love with your brother lvan.

137
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,038
It's only nat...

138
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,551
Ivan? You're kidding! He can barely write
his name in the ground with a stick.

139
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,511
He has true animal magnetism.

140
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,076
All that talk about some perfect love
and you're hot for lvan?

141
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,395
- He kissed me.
- Any place I should know?

142
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:28,433
- It warmed the cockles of my heart.
- Great. Nothing like hot cockles.

143
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,516
I think he's going to propose to me.

144
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,030
But he's a gambler and a drinker,
with a Neanderthal mentality.

145
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,357
I mean, I love him like a brother.
Just not one of mine.

146
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,358
Do you hear that commotion?
What's going on downstairs?

147
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,918
Have you heard the news?
Napoleon has invaded Austria.

148
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,999
- Why? Is he out of Courvoisier?
- A chance to taste the glories of battle.

149
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,951
Check with me when it's over...

150
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:54,278
- No, Boris. You're going to fight.
- You're gonna have your head examined.

151
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,597
- We leave the day after tomorrow.
- Fellas, I'm a pacifist.

152
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,508
- I don't believe in war.
- He doesn't believe in war.

153
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,870
Napoleon, he believes in war.

154
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,595
What are you going to do when
the French soldiers rape your sister?

155
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,756
- I don't have one.
- That's no answer.

156
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:14,192
- They won't rape lvan. They'd throw up.
- Don't disgrace me in front of my friends.

157
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,279
What good is war? We kill Frenchmen,
they kill Russians, then it's Easter.

158
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,868
Boris, you're talking about Mother Russia.

159
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,437
She's not my mother. My mother wouldn't
let her youngest get shrapnel in his gums.

160
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:29,439
- Get away from me.
- I can't believe what I'm seeing.

161
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:33,519
- He has a yellow streak down his back.
- No, it runs across.

162
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,393
- Boris, you're a coward.
- Yes, but a militant coward.

163
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,876
Boris. Medals... We'll get medals.

164
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,992
Take it easy, lvan.
You've got to cut down on your raw meat.

165
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,515
He'll go and he'll fight.

166
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,950
And I hope they will put him
in the front lines.

167
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,514
Thanks a lot, Mum. My mother, folks.

168
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,709
This is crazy. I can't shoot a gun.
I was meant to write poetry.

169
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:00,435
Sonja, I'm not the army type.
I slept with the light on till I was 30.

170
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,437
I can't shower with other men.

171
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,028
Friends. My friends.

172
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,438
On the eve of this glorious occasion,
I have an announcement to make.

173
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,836
Because we go into battle, perhaps
never to see our loved ones again,

174
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,430
I wish to announce
that tomorrow I intend to marry.

175
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:26,078
I'm going to take as my bride
a woman I have grown up with.

176
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,112
Anna lvanova.

177
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,876
Ivan.

178
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,549
I'm sorry. I should have told you.

179
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,108
I also have an announcement to make.

180
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,879
Tomorrow, I too get married.

181
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,398
I have been proposed to
and have accepted the hand of

182
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:51,069
Sergei lvanovich Minskov.

183
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,515
Yes... I mean Leonid Voskovec,
the herring merchant.

184
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,916
You! Get out here!

185
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,752
You're the worst soldier I ever seen.

186
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,273
- You ignorammus!
- Ignoramus, sir.

187
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,676
- You want a dishonourable discharge?
- Yes, sir. Or a furlough.

188
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,360
Goddamn you!
You love Russia, don't you?

189
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,357
- Yessir.
- Louder!

190
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,232
- You like it here?
- Yessir!

191
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:42,353
- You want to make a career in the army?
- Well, let's not get carried away.

192
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,710
You can clean the mess hall
and the latrine!

193
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,796
Yessir. How will I tell the difference?

194
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,989
OK.

195
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,032
One, two! One, two! One, two!

196
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,913
Three is next, if you're having any trouble.

197
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,876
Naturally, the war affects
the herring industry.

198
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,956
The ports are blockaded.

199
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,834
Fresh shipments of the herring
become more difficult to obtain.

200
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:54,589
And, of course, when something
hurts herring, it hurts me.

201
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,116
What people don't understand

202
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,879
is that there are hundreds
of types of herring,

203
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,753
each with its own interesting history.

204
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,155
Sonja. Are you OK?

205
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,957
Oh, yes.

206
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,593
But I've talked long enough.

207
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:18,430
Why don't you two play, as I have got
some important business to attend to?

208
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,036
A capital idea.

209
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,429
Ready? And a one and a two...

210
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,278
And...

211
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,190
- You stopped.
- What would you think

212
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:49,678
if I told you you were one of the most
beautiful women I have ever seen?

213
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:54,632
I'd think what a mad fool he is.

214
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:58,912
And what would you say
if I suddenly put my arms around you?

215
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,555
I'd think what a mad,
impetuous fool he is.

216
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,918
And what would you think if I kissed you?

217
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:09,919
I'd think what a mad,
impetuous, wonderful fool he is.

218
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,838
- Don't!
- I must!

219
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:16,111
- We just ate.
- Your skin, it is so beautiful.

220
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,356
Yes, I know. It covers my whole body.

221
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,311
I must have you.

222
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,273
No, not on the piano. It's a rented piano.

223
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,960
Darling, my darling, my...

224
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,113
Sonja!

225
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,359
Sonja, did you see a jar of wine sauce?

226
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,759
- Come to my quarters tomorrow at three.
- I can't.

227
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,314
- Please!
- It's immoral. What time?

228
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:44,069
- Who is to say what is moral?
- Morality is subjective.

229
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,430
Subjectivity is objective.

230
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,233
Moral notions imply attributes
to substances

231
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,555
which exist only in relational duality.

232
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:55,514
Not as an essential extension
of ontological existence.

233
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,029
Can we not talk about sex so much?

234
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,197
- I'm terribly sorry.
- You'd better go.

235
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,390
- Sonja, please.
- No, I mean it.

236
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,198
Men...

237
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,357
Next week, we leave for the front.

238
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,790
The object will be to kill
as many Frenchmen as possible.

239
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:20,354
Naturally, they are going to try
and kill as many Russians as possible.

240
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,072
If we kill more Frenchmen, we win.

241
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,791
If they kill more Russians, they win.

242
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,751
What do we win?

243
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,349
What do we win, Private?

244
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:37,037
lmagine your loved ones
conquered by Napoleon

245
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,594
and forced to live under French rule.

246
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:43,429
Do you want them to eat
that rich food and those heavy sauces?

247
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,471
No.

248
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,036
Do you want them to have
soufflé every meal and croissant?

249
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,878
No.

250
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,676
Men, since you are all getting a three-day
furlough before going into battle,

251
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:59,110
we would like to show you
this little hygiene play.

252
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,832
Goodbye. I hope you had a good time.

253
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,916
I did. I had a good time.

254
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,069
What's this sore on my lip?
I'd better see the doctor.

255
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,676
Doc, I have this sore on my lip.

256
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,712
- You have a social disease, my friend.
- Oh, my God.

257
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,673
If you do not treat it, you will go blind.

258
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,756
Or insane!

259
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,429
Well, men. That is the end of the play.

260
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:33,632
Have a good time on your furlough,
but look after yourselves!

261
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,719
- Well, what did you think of the play?
- It was weak. I was never interested.

262
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,115
Although the doctor
was played with gusto.

263
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,231
The girl had a delightful cameo role.

264
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:46,558
A satire of contemporary mores, a spoof
aimed more at the heart than the head.

265
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,513
I'm planning to spend
the next three days in a brothel.

266
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:53,349
- Can't you come with me?
- No. I went to a brothel once in my life.

267
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,436
I got hiccups. It was over like that.

268
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:58,154
And there's someone I must see
in Saint Petersburg.

269
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,952
Well, have fun.

270
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,194
I think the Magic Flute
is Mozart's greatest opera.

271
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,278
It's a hell of an opera, isn't it?
Do they sell popcorn?

272
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,597
We're so delighted you decided
to spend your furlough with us.

273
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,711
You were always our favourite nephew.

274
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,990
Even though you are
an incredible coward.

275
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,076
Thank you so much.

276
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,037
Any news of cousin Sonja?

277
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:27,119
Only that she and Voskovec
are unhappy and she takes lovers.

278
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,276
- She takes uppers?
- Lovers.

279
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,516
Oh, lovers.

280
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,876
Hey. Who is that?

281
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:39,271
That's the Countess Alexandrovna.

282
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,278
One of the most enticing women
in Saint Petersburg.

283
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,190
Ample bosoms, yes?

284
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,151
I'd say ample for a regiment.

285
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,236
She's recently widowed.

286
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,079
They say her husband, the Count,
died in her arms

287
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,875
trying to satisfy
her prodigious sexual desires.

288
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,356
No kidding! Died smiling, I bet.

289
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:02,278
Who's the character with her
with the wry moustache?

290
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,949
That's Anton lvanovich Lebedokov,
her current lover.

291
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,150
Although the way she's staring at you...

292
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,236
I could work something out with him.

293
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:13,397
I'd let him warm her up.
I could come in and finish her.

294
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:18,196
You must be careful of Anton lvanovich.
He has a furious temper.

295
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,312
- Really?
- He has killed several men in duels.

296
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,432
All in a jealous rage over the Countess.

297
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:27,757
Glad you mentioned it.
Think I'll watch the opera.

298
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,598
Ah, there is something about Mozart!

299
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,632
Well, I think you're probably
responding to his music.

300
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,354
Couldn't you be careful?

301
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,116
I believe...

302
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:37,074
I believe that the lobby of...

303
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,108
I believe that the lobby of the St Pete...

304
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,231
Opera House
is one of the most beautiful in Europe.

305
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,834
Who is this attractive
and mysterious soldier?

306
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,313
Boris Grushenko.

307
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,676
- Sorry. I goosed that lady.
- He has quite a sensitive face.

308
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,677
That's the part of me that shows.

309
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:03,839
Grushenko. Isn't he the young coward
all Saint Petersburg is talking about?

310
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:07,077
- Not so young. I'm 35.
- The one so afraid for his own safety,

311
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,111
he won't defend his country?

312
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,834
He is in a bad mood.
Don't you like your seats?

313
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,870
You must visit me for tea.
I'm sure we'd have a lot to talk about.

314
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,831
OK. I'll bring the tea bags.

315
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,269
We could run a check
on your erogenous zones.

316
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,995
- What about the dybbuk?
- Why do you always taunt me in public?

317
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,715
If you so much as
come near the Countess,

318
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,149
I'll see that you never see daylight again.

319
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:33,158
If a man said that to me,
I'd break his neck!

320
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:37,717
- I am a man.
- Well, I mean a much shorter man.

321
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,797
Boris! Boris Dimitrovitch!

322
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,909
Sonja!

323
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,078
Look at you.
You look so handsome in your uniform.

324
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,158
I got a perfect build for clothes.
I'm a 28 dwarf.

325
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:57,512
And you, Sonja, you look more beautiful
standing here than you do in person.

326
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,552
- Oh, Boris, I'm so unhappy.
- I wish you weren't.

327
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,875
Voskovec and I quarrel frequently.

328
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,195
- I've become a scandal.
- Poor Sonja.

329
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:08,153
I've been visiting Seretsky in his room.

330
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:11,279
Why? What's in his room?

331
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:15,435
And before Seretsky, Alexei.
And before Alexei, Alegorian.

332
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,949
- And before Alegorian, Asimov.
- OK!

333
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,036
Wait! I'm still on the A's.

334
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,879
- How many lovers do you have?
- In the midtown area?

335
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,115
- Oh, Sonja.
- Boris, my life is ruined. Over.

336
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:30,118
I can't stand Voskovec.

337
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:35,314
His mentality has reduced all the beauty
of the world to a small pickled fish.

338
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,477
Sonja, you need somebody
to take you away from Voskovec.

339
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:43,116
Someone who loves you. Someone who's
always loved you and cared for you.

340
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,076
How is your brother lvan?

341
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:51,278
- Ivan's all right.
- Yes? lvan is well?

342
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:55,109
lvan's a tiger. He did his basic training
in two weeks. Became a major.

343
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:58,313
- Does he ever speak of me?
- Sonja, he's busy.

344
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,954
Well, he must!
He must speak of me sometimes.

345
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,799
Take it easy, will you?
This is army property.

346
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:07,993
He... Once he was sick... He was delirious.
He called your name out.

347
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,076
Really? Then there's hope.

348
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:14,310
Look. Tomorrow, my regiment pulls out.
We're going to the front.

349
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:18,558
We're outnumbered by the French.
It's unlikely that any of us will come back.

350
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:22,116
- Exactly what did he say about me?
- Sonja!

351
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:27,156
Now, where did you say you were going?
Oh, yes, the war. Well...

352
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:30,511
Dress warmly, Boris,
and have a nice time.

353
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,436
The idea is not to panic and run,
then they shoot you in the back.

354
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:46,518
I don't want to be trampled by a horse.
And you, Boris?

355
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,200
I wouldn't mind.
I don't even want to fight.

356
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:52,118
It's no different living
under the Tsar or Napoleon.

357
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,356
They're both crooks. The Tsar's taller.

358
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,711
If you don't like Napoleon
and you don't like the Tsar,

359
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,035
who do you think should run the country?

360
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,879
- Do you really wanna know? The serfs.
- Oh, the serfs.

361
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,911
Only they know how to do things.

362
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:08,032
A fence needs putting up,
it's always the serfs.

363
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,549
He wants the serfs to run the country.

364
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:14,517
Why not the criminal element?
Or the Jews?

365
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,918
Some Jews are smart. Though I hear their
women don't practise sex after marriage.

366
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,996
- Are you married, Boris?
- Me? No.

367
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,511
- You got a sweetheart?
- No. I'm in love with a girl. She's married.

368
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:29,110
She's in love with someone and he's
married. It's a real healthy situation.

369
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,196
Hey, look, Boris. Look.

370
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:34,437
- What have you got there?
- I got a lock of my wife's hair.

371
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,757
A lock of her hair.
Jeez, she's probably running around bald.

372
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:41,839
Don't drop it. Have you got
a lock of your sweetheart's hair?

373
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:45,236
No. She's married.
But I got a lock of her husband's hair.

374
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,477
Boy, this army cooking'll
get you every time.

375
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,519
There's Visinksy. He was from my village.

376
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,871
- He was the village idiot.
- Yeah, what did you do? Place?

377
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,956
Oh, God is testing us.

378
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,837
If he's gonna test us,
why doesn't he give us a written?

379
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,356
Wow! The battle looks completely
different in the middle of it

380
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,597
than it does
to the generals up on the hill.

381
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,630
Hey, get your red-hots.

382
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,548
- You got anything to drink?
- The guy with the beer's coming.

383
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:18,558
You got something smaller than that?
I just started.

384
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:42,269
We started the battle with 12,000 men.

385
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,834
When it was over, we had 14 survivors.

386
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,316
We got a message from the Tsar
saying "Keep up the good work."

387
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:53,275
That night, as I was burying bodies,
I had another mystical experience.

388
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,356
Mercifully, God was on our side.

389
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,836
It could have gone a lot worse
if he wasn't. It might have rained.

390
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,030
Grushenko!

391
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:05,119
- Vladimir Maximovitch. You're alive.
- No, I'm dead. Look at this hole.

392
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:08,472
- Oh, does it hurt?
- I feel nothing.

393
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,039
You don't look so bad for a guy
who's dead. I think it agrees with you.

394
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,230
- Listen, do me a favour.
- Anything.

395
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:19,035
This engagement ring, I was gonna
give it to my girlfriend. A surprise.

396
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:22,038
- You want me to give it to her?
- No, what's the point?

397
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:26,278
Take it back to the jeweller's in Smolensk.
Vladimir Petroshnik.

398
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,356
Tell him I'm dead and get a refund.

399
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,119
- OK. What did you give him for this?
- 1600 roubles.

400
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:35,995
- For this you gave him 1600 roubles?
- This is a diamond with two baguettes...

401
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:39,112
This is insane!
I could have gotten you this ring for 1200.

402
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:42,038
- Never that ring. Never.
- The exact same ring.

403
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,879
Anyway. Listen, take the deposit.

404
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,672
- Go to Kiev.
- Right.

405
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,917
- Give it to a woman, Natasha Petrovna.
- Right. OK.

406
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,156
Get a receipt.
Make sure you get a receipt.

407
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,919
- Why do you need that? You're dead.
- Tax purposes.

408
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,110
Oh! Good thinking.

409
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:01,670
- What happened?
- He was cleaning his pistol. It went off.

410
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,837
- The bullet has lodged in his heart.
- Is it serious?

411
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,555
With proper medical care,
he could last another ten minutes.

412
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,478
Why were you cleaning your pistol?

413
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:18,598
I was going to fight a duel
to defend your honour.

414
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:23,279
A Turkish cavalry officer
cast aspersions on it.

415
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,436
He said you were sleeping around.

416
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:30,033
I knew he was lying, that you were pure.

417
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,278
Yes, well...

418
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,198
Leonid, I know I could have been
a better wife to you.

419
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,756
Kinder. I could have made love
with you more often.

420
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:53,429
- Or once, even.
- Once would have been nice.

421
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,677
You were a kind and loving husband.

422
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,519
Generous and always considerate.

423
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,551
What's he got? About eight minutes?

424
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:04,513
I think I'm slow. He's got about three.

425
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:10,833
Swimming out to the open sea
like the great wild herring.

426
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:16,789
I realise this must be
a great blow to you, Sonja.

427
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:21,279
But you must not allow yourself
to be consumed with grief.

428
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,236
The dead pass on,

429
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,599
and life is for the living.

430
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,792
I guess you're right.

431
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,751
Where do you wanna eat?

432
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,836
- Let's go to Rykoff's.
- No, no, no.

433
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:37,077
- Why?
- I feel like meat, not a cheese sandwich.

434
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,156
It's not good for your health.

435
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:43,319
There's a tavern at the edge of the square
makes a sausage that's wonderful.

436
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,317
Meanwhile, the war continued.

437
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:49,877
My regiment had been wiped out and
I found myself lost behind enemy lines.

438
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,476
I panicked, and hid where I could.

439
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,830
Then I fainted.

440
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:59,157
When I came to, I realised
I had made a terrible mistake.

441
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:38,392
As fate would have it, I landed
on a group of French generals,

442
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:41,671
causing their immediate surrender,
and making me a hero.

443
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:45,759
My brother lvan was not so lucky.
He was a fatality of war.

444
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:50,032
He had been bayoneted to death
by a Polish conscientious objector.

445
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,796
You're praying for lvan?

446
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,753
Yes. Your husband.

447
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,836
I loved him, as you know.

448
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:08,115
I wanted you
to have some of his possessions.

449
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,196
How kind.

450
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:15,237
I kept his sword, and gold watch.

451
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,756
But, here,

452
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,758
I'm giving you his moustache.

453
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,316
I'll cherish it.

454
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,031
Also,

455
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,116
some string.

456
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,756
Ivan saved string.

457
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:35,714
I know.
It was one of the reasons why I loved him.

458
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,436
I understand that.

459
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:42,039
I loved him for his string, too.

460
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,789
Anything else for me?

461
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:49,271
I thought we should divide his letters.

462
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:53,388
Do you want
the vowels or the consonants?

463
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,351
His vowels.

464
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:58,153
You keep the consonants.

465
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:01,513
Life is unbearable.

466
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:06,071
- So we meet again.
- Countess Alexandrovna.

467
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:11,351
I wish there was a way to thank you
for what you've done for Russia.

468
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:16,032
- I may be able to think of something.
- Maybe we could meet in my room later.

469
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,594
As you wish. How's five minutes?

470
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:21,075
Well. What have we here?

471
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,192
- Still dating laughing boy, huh?
- Back from the war, I see.

472
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,039
I'd have stayed longer,
but they ran out of medals.

473
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:30,118
I understand
your heroism was quite inadvertent.

474
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,712
You should have
such inadvertent heroism.

475
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:38,072
- Are you still talking to this strutting ass?
- Careful. It's a trick question.

476
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:42,398
Fetch my carriage, Lebedokov.
I'll join you momentarily.

477
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,476
Nice seeing you again, Quasimodo.

478
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:49,356
- My room at midnight?
- Perfect. Will you be there, too?

479
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,630
- Naturally.
- Until midnight, then.

480
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,716
Midnight.

481
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,436
- Make it a quarter to twelve.
- Midnight.

482
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:00,199
- Midnight.
- Boris, you hardly touched your blini!

483
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,437
Yes, well... I've been sick, you know...

484
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,956
Come in!

485
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,431
How do you like it?

486
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,472
It's all right.
I prefer something sexy, but...

487
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:27,076
Would you like some wine?
Something to put you in the mood.

488
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:31,269
Oh, I've been in the mood
since the late 1700s.

489
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,473
You're disgusting, but I love you.

490
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,678
Well, my disgustingness
is my best feature.

491
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,956
It must be lonely at the front.

492
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:45,356
How long has it been
since you've made love to a woman?

493
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,675
What's today? Monday, Tuesday...

494
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:51,909
- Two years.
- Two years. You do remember how?

495
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,600
Well, if you start me, it'll all come back.

496
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,196
Remember that?

497
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,390
Yes. That was just like kissing, right?

498
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:20,718
You're the greatest lover I've ever had.

499
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,752
Well, I practise a lot when I'm alone.

500
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,998
- Shall we say pistols at dawn?
- We can say it. What does it mean?

501
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:39,236
You have insulted the Countess' honour.

502
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:42,477
- Why? I let her finish first.
- Her seconds will call on you.

503
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:46,957
- Seconds? I never gave her seconds.
- My seconds will call on your seconds.

504
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,640
My seconds will be out.
Have 'em call on my thirds.

505
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,069
If my thirds are out, go to my fourths.

506
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:56,678
He's serious!
You must meet him on the field of honour.

507
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,633
I'm not gonna duel with him.
He's a marksman and a killer.

508
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,036
- Your honour is at stake!
- Hey, what is this? Slap Boris Day?

509
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:07,551
You are a war hero. Surely a duel with
Anton Lebedokov is nothing to fear?

510
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,194
Look, I just don't wanna
waste a good bullet.

511
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:14,393
The kid's rash. I'll drop by later,
give him a chance to apologise.

512
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,556
If he doesn't, I'll move to Finland.

513
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,716
Guess who.

514
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,956
Oh, I'd know those hands anywhere.

515
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,116
It's Old Nehamkin.

516
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,470
No. It's...

517
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,194
- Boris!
- Yes. How are you?

518
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,595
- I brought you a present.
- What?

519
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:42,598
You know those earrings
you always wanted? The long ones?

520
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,676
Thank you, cousin Boris.

521
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,236
Twice removed. By tomorrow morning,
I may be removed completely.

522
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:51,318
What is it? You look so worried.

523
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,318
Sonja, are you scared of dying?

524
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,795
Scared is the wrong word.

525
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,797
I'm frightened of it.

526
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:01,275
It's an interesting distinction.

527
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,713
If only God would give me some sign.

528
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,956
If he would just speak to me once.

529
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:12,392
Anything. One sentence. Two words.
If he would just cough.

530
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:16,308
Of course there's a God.
We're made in his image.

531
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,236
You think I was made in God's image?
You think he wears glasses?

532
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:23,750
- Not with those frames.
- Nothingness.

533
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,356
Non-existence.

534
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:30,034
Black emptiness.

535
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,550
- What did you say?
- Oh, I was just planning my future.

536
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,475
Why are you so preoccupied with death?

537
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,591
Sit down with me for a second.

538
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:42,429
Sonja, tomorrow morning I'm gonna
fight a duel with Anton Lebedokov.

539
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:46,872
He's much better than I am at it
and I'll probably be killed.

540
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,470
In case I don't see you again,
I wanted to say that I love you.

541
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:53,034
- Boris!
- I've loved you ever since we were kids.

542
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,310
I was heartbroken when you loved lvan.

543
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,351
Why didn't you say something?

544
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:00,278
- Would it have mattered?
- Oh, of course not, darling.

545
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,871
lf, by some miracle, I'm not killed
tomorrow, would you marry me?

546
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:09,197
What do you think the odds are?

547
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:12,039
To die before the harvest...

548
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:16,353
The crops, the grains.
Fields of rippling wheat.

549
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,950
Wheat. All there is in life is wheat.

550
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:24,073
Sonja, here's your chance to do
something kind for a dying boy.

551
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:28,716
But I don't really love Boris. I mean,
I love him, but I'm not in love with him.

552
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:32,116
Oh, wheat! Lots of wheat! Fields of wheat.

553
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,435
A tremendous amount of wheat!

554
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:37,552
And yet, he loves me.
And he would make a devoted husband.

555
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:42,037
Not too exciting, but devoted. We'd have
a family. Maybe we could rent one.

556
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:45,357
I could learn to love him.
Me, Boris and six rented children.

557
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:49,029
Or would I feel trapped?
Suffocated? Can't breathe?

558
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:52,869
Open a window!
No, not that one! The one in the bathroom.

559
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:57,073
Yellow wheat. Red wheat.
Wheat with feathers. Cream of wheat.

560
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,589
Poor boy, duelling with Anton Lebedokov.

561
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:03,349
By tomorrow, my beloved cousin
Boris will look like a Swiss cheese.

562
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:06,313
Promise him anything,
make him happy for a night.

563
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:10,194
Oh! Or would I feel trapped?
Suffocated? My youth gone?

564
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,993
Living with a Swiss cheese
and rented children.

565
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:16,510
Of course I'll marry you, Boris.
It would be an honour for me.

566
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:24,750
This Anton Lebedokov,
he is a good shot, isn't he?

567
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,950
- I'm afraid so.
- Well,

568
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,594
since this may be
your last night on earth,

569
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,836
let's go back to my room and make love.

570
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,510
Nice idea. I'll bring the soy sauce.

571
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:11,356
At last. You're late, Grushenko.
We thought you weren't coming.

572
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:15,268
- Well, I overslept.
- Can you be so relaxed and confident?

573
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,960
I hate to shoot anybody
before my morning tea.

574
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,116
I get a lot of bad mail from the serfs.

575
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,674
I implore both of you,
come back to your senses.

576
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,634
It can still be called off, by mutual
consent, with no loss of honour.

577
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:29,558
Since you put it that way,
maybe I will hop back into bed.

578
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,956
We'll do it now and to the death.

579
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:36,038
Oh, no! I can't do anything to the death.
Doctor's orders.

580
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,550
I have an ulcer condition.
Dying is one of the worst things for it.

581
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,636
Begin.

582
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:45,438
You have been challenged. Choose.

583
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,756
Sure.

584
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,678
- All right, I'll take these.
- Just one.

585
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:59,073
Oh, he gets one! That was silly.

586
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:05,556
Starting back to back, on my signal,
you will walk ten paces, turn and fire.

587
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,117
- Is that clear?
- Of course.

588
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,196
Of course.

589
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:15,598
Good luck. And God be with you both.

590
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,676
Are you listening?

591
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,796
One, two,

592
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,797
three, four,

593
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,672
five, six,

594
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,631
seven, eight,

595
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,591
nine, ten.

596
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,679
Does this come out from dry-cleaning?

597
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:03,350
- You must shoot.
- No, no, I don't wanna shoot.

598
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:06,358
You must. It's the law.

599
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:10,355
Well, if it's the law,
then I'll shoot in the air.

600
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:13,915
There. I've fulfilled my obligation.

601
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:21,796
Boris Dimitrovitch.

602
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:24,150
I've learnt a great lesson here today.

603
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:27,556
Me too. Never shoot up in the air
when you're standing under it.

604
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:30,877
You could have killed me. And you didn't.

605
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,911
How can I ever repay you?

606
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,031
You can start by getting off my toe.

607
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:37,116
Oh, I beg your pardon.

608
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:41,230
Boris Dimitrovitch, from this day on,
I will lead a new life.

609
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:43,316
I will modify my views.

610
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:46,159
I will preach goodness,
perhaps join the church.

611
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:48,714
I will lead a righteous life.

612
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:51,957
Devote myself, as I did in my childhood,
to my singing.

613
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,276
He's got a great voice, hasn't he?
I should have shot him.

614
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,436
And so, Sonja and I married.

615
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:05,189
I now pronounce you man and wife.

616
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:11,318
I'm so happy. Look at the kid.
She's so happy, she's speechless.

617
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:16,070
He missed. He missed... He missed.

618
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:28,429
I know you're worried whether
you'll be stimulating enough for me.

619
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:32,951
Whether it's possible to live up to
the chores and obligations of married life.

620
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:36,834
It's gonna be a cinch, I promise.
I have no bad habits at all.

621
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,110
I grant that I have a few eccentricities.

622
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:43,153
I won't eat any food that begins
with the letter F. Like chicken.

623
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,953
Boris, I just don't love you.

624
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:49,755
- Oh, Sonja.
- I love you. But I'm not in love with you.

625
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:52,189
Sonja, do you even know
what love means?

626
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:54,914
There are many
different kinds of love, Boris.

627
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,349
There's love between
a man and a woman.

628
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:59,436
Love between a mother and a son.

629
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:01,676
Two women. Let's not forget my favourite.

630
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:06,590
- And the love I've always dreamed of.
- Yeah?

631
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,314
The love between
two extraordinary individuals.

632
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:13,115
- Sonja.
- Oh, don't, Boris. Please.

633
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:16,114
Sex without love is an empty experience.

634
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:20,674
Yes, but as empty experiences go,
it's one of the best.

635
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,758
At fýrst, things were
a little tense between us.

636
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,995
But after a while, she relaxed.

637
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,756
Don't. Not here.

638
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:45,074
Soon, Sonja got more used to me.

639
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,668
Sometimes, she actually had fun.

640
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:50,360
Like the time she baked her fýrst soufflé.

641
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:01,759
Money was scarce, and Sonja learned
to make wonderful dishes out of snow.

642
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:05,668
- Sweetheart, it looks a little rare to me.
- I baked it for an hour and a half.

643
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:08,360
Did you? Cos it looks...
What's for dessert?

644
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,357
- A surprise, Boris.
- Yes? What?

645
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:15,110
- A nice big bowl of sleet!
- Oh, sleet! My favourite! That's wonderful.

646
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:18,270
Evenings, we played music together.

647
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,960
And as time passed, I won her heart.

648
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:24,710
Oh, Boris. I've never been so happy
in my entire life.

649
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:28,674
I love you, Boris, in a deeper way
than I ever thought was possible.

650
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,438
Really?

651
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:33,676
I wanna have children with you.

652
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,711
- What kind?
- Little children.

653
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:38,832
Of course.
The big ones are mentally slower.

654
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:41,394
- I wanna have three children.
- One of each.

655
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,795
Oh, Boris.

656
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,672
I'm actually happy.

657
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:48,428
Well, I hate to say I told you so, but

658
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,835
some men have it and some men don't.

659
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:53,510
Fortunately, I have so much of it.

660
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:58,037
Those next months
were the happiest time of my life.

661
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:09,232
Then one day, at the height
of my sense of wellbeing,

662
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:11,555
I suddenly,
and for no apparent reason,

663
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:14,513
was seized with an urge
to commit suicide.

664
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:18,110
You're healthy, you have a beautiful wife,
your work is going well.

665
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,117
I know, but something's missing.

666
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:23,038
- What?
- I feel a void at the centre of my being.

667
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:26,277
- What kind of void?
- Well, an empty void.

668
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:27,355
An empty void?

669
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:30,472
I felt the full void a month ago,
but it was something I ate.

670
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,473
Maybe what you have
is a sickness of the soul.

671
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,835
- Look, there's Death.
- What? Who?

672
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:39,674
Death!
He's got Krapotkin, the wine merchant.

673
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:41,836
- Really?
- Yeah, and a woman.

674
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:45,111
- Ooh, it's not Mrs Krapotkin.
- You're kidding.

675
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:48,312
No. I always knew Krapotkin
was diddling somebody else.

676
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:52,753
- Where are you taking Krapotkin?
- Away! For ever!

677
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:55,997
Listen, if you run into my wife,
tell her I'm with you!

678
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:59,749
Goodbye, Krapotkin.
If you get a chance, write.

679
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:07,077
Father Andre,
holiest of holies, aged and wise,

680
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:10,112
you are the most wrinkled man
in the entire country.

681
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:13,437
Get off my beard, you little jerk.

682
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:18,278
Rise, my child. Rise.

683
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:23,315
- I'm standing.
- My eyesight is poor.

684
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:28,153
Everyone says you're senile with age,
but you're the only one that can help me.

685
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,430
I don't think you're senile.

686
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:33,074
Where did you say the fish was caught?

687
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:37,159
- What fish?
- Didn't you say something about fish?

688
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:40,511
Father, Boris is trying to commit suicide.

689
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:45,158
Last week he contemplated killing
himself by inhaling next to an Armenian.

690
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:47,874
Tell Boris this.

691
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:51,437
I have lived many years

692
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:57,351
and, after many trials and tribulations,

693
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:02,838
I have come to the conclusion
that the best thing is...

694
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:04,109
Yes?

695
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:07,994
...blonde, 12-year-old girls.

696
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:09,109
Father!

697
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:12,038
Two of them, whenever possible.

698
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,276
Father, I counted on you.

699
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,788
I forgive you. I forgive you.

700
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:21,753
Thank you, Your Grubbiness.

701
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,436
As I dangled at the rope's end,

702
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:29,074
I was suddenly seized
with an urge to live.

703
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,111
All I could think of was Sonja.

704
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:34,516
I wanted to hold her close to me,
weep tears on her shoulder,

705
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:36,517
and engage in oral sex.

706
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,995
It was then that I made
the decision to live,

707
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:41,156
to live and become a great poet.

708
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:44,188
I should have been

709
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:49,110
a pair of ragged claws

710
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:55,190
scuttling across the floors

711
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:58,711
of silent seas.

712
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,710
Too sentimental.

713
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:07,158
That winter
Sonja and I had a wonderful time.

714
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:10,352
We found a new friend,
Berdykov, the village idiot.

715
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:14,553
Berdykov would sit smiling for days
and stroke a little piece of velvet.

716
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:17,319
Sonja would make him happy
by feeding him cookies.

717
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:20,910
We looked forward to the spring,
when we could have a child of our own.

718
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:22,553
Little did we know...

719
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:27,670
War! Napoleon
has invaded Russia! It's war!

720
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:34,950
Oh, what about all our plans?
We were gonna be parents this year!

721
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:38,595
There's gonna be a slight change.
Instead, we're gonna be refugees.

722
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:42,395
- That's terrible!
- We have to take everything and flee.

723
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:46,513
I'm very good at that. I was the men's
freestyle fleeing champion for two years.

724
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:50,918
We have to burn the food so the French
don't get it. But it's tough to light borscht.

725
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:53,270
- Boris, I have an idea.
- What?

726
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,550
Let's assassinate Napoleon.

727
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:00,112
Yeah. Interesting.
Do you want to start knitting dinner?

728
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:02,549
- I'm serious.
- What do you mean?

729
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:05,069
I mean, let's you and I kill Napoleon.

730
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:08,317
You been drinking from
the glass we use for the village idiot?

731
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:11,955
- It's the answer to our problems.
- It's not the answer. It's an answer.

732
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:16,517
And it's the wrong answer.
The correct answer is flee. F-L-E-A. Flee.

733
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:20,076
- The French occupy Moscow. He's there.
- Sonja!

734
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:23,590
Two innocent-looking types like us
could get in and shoot him.

735
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:26,154
We'd never get near him,
and if we did, we'd miss.

736
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:28,236
He's a tough target. He's very small.

737
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:30,999
Boris, it's our chance
to perform a truly heroic act.

738
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:33,315
Since when is murder a heroic act?

739
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:36,830
Violence is justified
in the service of mankind.

740
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:39,269
- Who said that?
- Attila the Hun.

741
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:41,511
You're quoting a Hun to me?

742
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,790
Don't you know
that murder carries with it

743
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:48,550
a moral imperative that transcends
any notion of inherent universal free will?

744
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:53,038
That is incredibly jejune.

745
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:56,510
- That's jejune?
- Jejune!

746
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:00,679
You have the temerity to say that
I'm talking to you out of jejunosity?

747
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:03,837
I am one of the most june people
in all of the Russias.

748
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:05,712
I have lvan's old pistol.

749
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:08,593
Sonja!
Political assassination doesn't work.

750
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:12,474
Violence leads to violence. He who
lives by the sword dies by the sword.

751
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:14,477
Well, I'm out of clichés now.

752
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:18,639
- Are you suggesting passive resistance?
- No, I'm suggesting active fleeing.

753
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:22,230
- You can't run away all your life.
- I know, but murder.

754
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:24,316
The most foul of all crimes.

755
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:28,399
And not abstract murder like shooting
an unknown enemy on the battlefield,

756
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:31,512
but standing in a closed room
with a live human being

757
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:33,915
and pulling the trigger, face to face.

758
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:37,999
And a famous human being, a successful
one, one who earns more than I do.

759
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:42,398
My God, you figure Napoleon has gotta
be good for 10,000 francs a week.

760
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:46,479
That's minimum. That's without tips
or extras. Nothing like that.

761
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:49,592
And me, what am I? He's a great man.

762
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:53,508
He thinks like the superman
and I'm just a worm,

763
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:59,317
an insect, some kind of crawling,
disgusting, creeping little vermin.

764
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:03,835
- You know, you can stop me.
- I will when I disagree.

765
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:06,076
Sonja. Who are we to kill somebody?

766
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:09,988
Boris, for the first time in my life
I feel free. Weightless.

767
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:13,590
I have an exhilarating feeling
of human freedom.

768
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:15,472
It's called the guillotine.

769
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:17,033
Oh, look, Boris.

770
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:20,630
The soft golden dusk is
already transmogrifying itself

771
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:23,149
into the blue star-sprinkled night.

772
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:27,114
Careful, cos that gun may be loaded.

773
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:29,834
Several days later
we set out for Moscow.

774
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:33,316
We took Berdykov with us partway.
He was on his way to Minsk.

775
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:37,638
There was a village idiots' convention in
Minsk. Berdykov was planning to attend.

776
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:40,991
Village idiots from all over Russia
were meeting there.

777
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:53,038
We drove through
small villages and tiny hamlets.

778
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:58,029
We had no great plan, but when we
stopped at an inn, fate provided one.

779
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:12,598
Pardon me. Could you tell me
who those people are behind that screen?

780
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:16,076
That's Don Francisco of Spain
and his sister.

781
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,839
They're en route to meet Napoleon.

782
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:32,994
- Don Francisco, I presume.
- Do you know me, señor?

783
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:35,953
Oh, let's just say
your name is legend in these parts.

784
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:39,074
- It is?
- Well, perhaps not legend,

785
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,839
but it never fails to get a big laugh.

786
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:46,795
And you must be the Don's sister,
the noted Spanish countess and mieskeit.

787
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:48,831
Who are you?

788
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:52,430
Just a humble servant
who wishes to buy His Excellency a drink.

789
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:54,391
I would be honoured.

790
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:59,197
Waiter, a bottle of your best red wine,
please, and two straws.

791
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:01,436
Two straws.

792
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:04,233
Word has it
the Don is en route to visit Napoleon.

793
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:07,910
Word travels fast.

794
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:11,358
Not as fast as good news.

795
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:14,633
No news is good news.

796
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:18,310
Here today, gone tomorrow.

797
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:22,829
You can lead a horse to water,
but you can't make him drink.

798
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:25,394
- Your turn.
- We would invite you to join us,

799
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:29,798
but the difference in social rank and
wealth, it makes it silly.

800
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:33,351
Oh, yes, I threw this on.
It's a knockdown.

801
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:36,670
You guys know Napoleon, or what?

802
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:39,555
Hardly.

803
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:43,357
A joke, Your Nothingness?

804
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:46,995
We're friends with his brother,
who arranges the affairs of Spain,

805
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:50,590
but this is our first meeting
with the great emperor.

806
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:54,952
It's all I wanted to know.

807
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:00,633
- Don Francisco?
- Pardon me?

808
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:03,513
I'm having trouble adjusting my belt.

809
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:07,237
You think you could come over here
and hold my bosom for awhile?

810
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:10,956
Of course, señorita.

811
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:55,037
No, no, no, it's not what I had in mind.

812
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:59,155
It should have more cream
between the crust and no raisins.

813
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:02,397
- But at our last meeting you said raisins.
- No!

814
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:07,796
If this pastry is to bear my name,
it must be richer! More cream.

815
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:10,354
- Yes, but is there time?
- Very little.

816
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:13,358
My spies tell me
that my illustrious British enemy

817
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:18,349
is working on a new meat recipe
which he plans to call Beef Wellington.

818
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:20,789
It will never get off the ground.

819
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:24,754
We must develop the Napoleon
before he develops Beef Wellington.

820
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:29,312
The future of Europe
hangs in the balance.

821
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:31,396
Yes, Your Highness.

822
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,196
We must see you, Your Highness.

823
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:38,033
We believe there is a plot
to take your life.

824
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:39,275
Vraiment?

825
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:44,838
So we've made up an obscure private
from the ranks to look like you. Look.

826
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:46,951
How do you do, Your Highness?

827
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:51,588
- He looks like me?
- You're seeing him without his rug.

828
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:02,068
- Come.
- Just let me get this on, Your Highness.

829
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,515
And now I take your place.

830
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:11,478
I will teach you to walk like me.
I have a great walk.

831
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:17,751
With the emperor out of the way,
all that remains is to kill Don Francisco.

832
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:23,151
That will destroy His Highness'
stupid dreams of a treaty with Spain.

833
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:27,153
Then I'll sail to Austria,

834
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:33,397
and form an alliance with the crown.
Not the king, just the crown.

835
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:36,271
They call me mad,

836
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:39,631
but one day,
when the history of France is written,

837
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:41,910
they will mark my name well.

838
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,956
Sidney Applebaum.

839
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,956
We're here to see the emperor.

840
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:02,676
Who is calling?

841
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:10,513
- Who? Oh, that's droll!
- Droll, yes.

842
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:14,553
He's not familiar with the list of
the hundred most important Spanishers.

843
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:17,319
Yes.
It is only Don Francisco and his sister.

844
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:19,396
Yes, the Donessa.

845
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:21,476
We have an appointment with Napoleon.

846
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:24,512
Napoleon Bonaparte.
The noted international tyrant.

847
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:27,996
- You are Don Francisco and his sister?
- Oh, for sure.

848
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:31,430
- We have had a long... a hot journey.
- A hot journey.

849
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:33,949
- Our throats are parched.
- They're parched.

850
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:36,548
- We seek succour. Succour.
- Succour!

851
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:39,717
Yes. Is Succour here by any chance?

852
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:42,912
I never knew your name, madam.

853
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:46,350
The boys usually just call me Juanita.

854
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:54,393
The emperor appreciates
magnificent women.

855
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:57,353
- He'll be much taken with you.
- Oh, good! I wore my flats.

856
00:59:57,480 --> 01:00:00,870
We are, of course, all most anxious
to hear your proposal for a treaty.

857
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:05,551
Good. I've given it a lot of thought
and I've come up with all the little details.

858
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:08,717
If I can just think of the main points,
we got something!

859
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:11,513
Let's leave business,
you've had a wearing journey.

860
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:15,997
- We should say hello to the emperor.
- Shorts gets touchy if we bypass him.

861
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:21,752
Later. First, you'll be wined and dined
in a manner befitting Spanish nobility.

862
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:25,316
Oh, wonderful! But go easy on
the champagne. The Donessa has gout.

863
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:28,477
Well, if you'll proceed,
your needs will be attended to.

864
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:30,556
Thank you.

865
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:35,433
While you're here with your sister,
should you desire a French love dream

866
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:38,074
to be sent to your room,
it will be arranged.

867
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:41,954
Good. Maybe I'll have two
to keep the symmetry perfect.

868
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:46,631
- I prefer two myself.
- I prefer three, but it's hard to get one.

869
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:59,153
Is this room big enough,
or would you prefer a suite?

870
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:02,590
- Boris, I'm scared.
- You? I'm growing a beak and feathers.

871
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:05,280
- What are we gonna do?
- I say we get outta here now.

872
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:08,551
I'm not leaving here
until we shoot Napoleon. Here.

873
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:10,716
Oh, I see. Thanks. I'm the hit man.

874
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:13,832
Remember, you can't take any chances.

875
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:19,239
Now, make sure the barrel of the gun
is pressed against his head or his chest.

876
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:22,830
And don't pull the trigger, Boris.
Squeeze it.

877
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:26,438
Where did you go to finishing school?
On a pirate ship?

878
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:28,869
Let's just make sure
our plans are straight.

879
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:32,356
OK. You flirt with him,
bring him back here after dinner,

880
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:35,438
lull him into a state of satisfaction
and I'll shoot him.

881
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:38,836
"I'll shoot him."
Can you believe I'm talking like this?

882
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:44,677
Yes. Spain is quite warm this time of year.

883
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:46,870
Barcelona is warmer than Madrid,

884
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:51,596
but, then, the people are so different,
the Barcelonians and the Madridniks.

885
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:55,635
Are all the ladies in Spain
as beautiful as you are, madam?

886
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:58,320
Well, not all. You gotta have some beasts.

887
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:00,509
Oh, General.

888
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:02,995
Do excuse me, madam.

889
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:05,995
Take it easy.
You're making a fool of yourself.

890
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:09,590
- Hey, this is good champagne.
- Are you gonna drink another case?

891
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:11,676
I'll be fine, all I need is a few solids.

892
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:13,870
A few solids? You should drink a blotter.

893
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:17,436
Oh, I believe I had the pleasure
of meeting your sister once.

894
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:20,996
- My sister? Which one?
- I thought you only had one.

895
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:22,917
One? Oh, no, no.

896
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:25,838
Actually, well, I have a half-sister.

897
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:29,509
Well, no, not exactly half. It's two-fifths.

898
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:31,198
Ladies and gentlemen,

899
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:34,835
His lmperial Highness,
the Emperor Napoleon.

900
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:48,509
- So you are Don Francisco?
- Yes. I have regards from your brother.

901
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:51,916
Says you went away, you don't write.
He never hears from you.

902
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:54,110
You took his razor,
you never returned it.

903
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:56,754
- This is an honour for me.
- It's a greater honour for me.

904
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:59,599
- No, a greater honour for me.
- No, a greater honour for me.

905
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:03,190
- No, a greater honour for me.
- Well, perhaps it is a greater for you.

906
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:06,915
- You must be Don Francisco's sister.
- You must be Don Francisco's sister.

907
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:10,999
- No, you must be Don Francisco's sister.
- No, you must be Don Francisco's sister.

908
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:14,908
- No, it's a greater honour for me.
- Our guests have a sense of humour.

909
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:17,508
- She's a great kidder.
- No, you're a great kidder.

910
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:19,471
No, you're Don Francisco's sister.

911
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:21,875
- Shall we dine?
- Oh, can we eat first?

912
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:35,718
Your sister and His Highness
seem to be getting along quite well.

913
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:37,876
Do you find me attractive as a man?

914
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,036
Yes. I think that's your best bet.

915
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:44,155
How much of your feelings for me
are because I rule half of Europe?

916
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:46,350
Oh, I'd say half my feelings. It evens out.

917
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:49,313
Will you be more difficult
to conquer than Russia?

918
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:51,158
Well, I weigh less.

919
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:54,590
- I'll go to your room after dinner.
- Good. I'll go to yours.

920
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:04,036
Come in.

921
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:09,309
Sonja, I've been thinking
about this. It's murder.

922
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:12,238
If everybody did this,
it'd be a world full of murderers.

923
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:14,828
- What would that do to property values?
- I know.

924
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:17,679
If everybody went to
the same restaurant one evening

925
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:20,394
to eat blintzes, there'd be chaos.
But they don't.

926
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:22,988
I tell her murder. She tells me blintzes.

927
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:25,554
Hey, you said yourself
there is no right or wrong.

928
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:27,910
- It's what you choose.
- That's right,

929
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:29,951
and I choose danger.

930
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:33,277
- Oh, really?
- No, but it sounded great tonight.

931
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:37,635
Oh, Boris.
If only we could be children again.

932
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:40,149
Yeah, I know. Preferably French children.

933
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:44,353
Do you know the only truly happy person
I know is Berdykov, the village idiot?

934
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:46,789
It's easier to be happy
if your only concern

935
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:49,229
is figuring out how much saliva to dribble.

936
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:51,555
- Kiss me.
- Which one do you want?

937
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:55,753
- Give me a number eight.
- That's two fours. That's an easy one.

938
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:01,436
Coming!

939
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:16,838
- Are you alone?
- Of course.

940
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:19,110
- I thought I heard voices.
- I was praying.

941
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:21,913
- I heard two voices.
- Oh, well, I do both parts.

942
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:25,794
Champagne! From France.

943
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:28,356
I see you brought the whole kit.

944
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:45,800
- To your eyes.
- To the bridge of your nose.

945
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:50,756
My lust knows no bounds.

946
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:52,836
Shall we... to the bed?

947
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:54,996
Shall we what to the bed?

948
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:57,076
Forgive my haste.

949
01:05:57,200 --> 01:06:01,796
We have always heard
that Spanish blood is the hottest.

950
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:04,753
- I had mine cooled for the summer.
- You may set the pace.

951
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:08,509
Good. Why don't we just
sit awhile and build slowly?

952
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:11,916
You don't want to peak too early.
You'll be gone before midnight.

953
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:15,430
- You are a temptress.
- Oh, please, Excellency.

954
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:19,030
- Call me Napoleon.
- Good. You can call me Napoleon, too.

955
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:20,991
I've never met a woman like you.

956
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:24,476
I could rest my head on your shoulder
like this for ever.

957
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:28,677
Yes, it sounds like it'd be fun,
except for the grease mark.

958
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:30,756
His Excellency.

959
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,956
- What's that?
- Oh, just a breeze.

960
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:42,799
A breeze with mice.
Mice, what's the difference?

961
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:45,912
If I had a woman like you
instead of my wife,

962
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:47,996
I would conquer all of Europe.

963
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:51,676
- What's that?
- What? Oh, that.

964
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:54,314
I think that was the old closet door
slamming shut.

965
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:57,910
One can't be too careful. The Russian
underground would love me dead.

966
01:06:58,040 --> 01:07:00,759
I take a great chance
in an occupied territory.

967
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:02,916
Assassins surround me.

968
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:06,555
Every day
is another encounter with death.

969
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:10,719
Yes, well... This is the price
one pays for political power.

970
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:12,990
Yes, life at the top is hell.

971
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:15,509
Which is why
I relish every minute with you.

972
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:17,835
Every second means something to me.

973
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:20,476
That's why the sooner...

974
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:24,434
The sooner we consummate
the act of love, the happier I will be.

975
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:27,871
- Go ahead.
- I can't.

976
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,070
- Don Francisco.
- Shoot!

977
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:32,430
Put down that pistol. She's over 18.

978
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:34,994
You're a tyrant and a dictator
and you start wars.

979
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:37,350
- Why is he reciting my credits?
- Kill him!

980
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:39,436
- Guards!
- No.

981
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,150
Boris, we're not here on a vacation.

982
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:50,556
I can't shoot him. He's a human being.
He'll bleed on the carpet.

983
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:52,591
Give me that gun.

984
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:55,796
See? It's not so easy.

985
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:58,396
Why? Why can't I do it?

986
01:07:58,520 --> 01:08:00,476
Because it's morally wrong.

987
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:04,229
- I see. Can you define your terms?
- There's a moral imperative here.

988
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:07,716
- Where?
- By killing Napoleon, you kill yourself,

989
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:10,832
because we're involved
in a kind of a total absolute.

990
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:13,679
Come on. We're not.
You're being pantheistic again.

991
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:18,590
How is that pantheistic? We all
relate universally to a giant oneness.

992
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:22,750
You wanna hit him? He's coming to again.
Just give him a little shot.

993
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:24,916
We're dealing with an ethical question.

994
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:27,429
You're not gonna quote
Thomas Aquinas again?

995
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:32,156
Absolutely. He said "Never kill a man,
particularly if it means taking his life."

996
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:36,635
What?

997
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:40,230
If we don't stop him,
he'll burn down half of Europe.

998
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:42,874
Maybe it'll be
the half with our landlord in it.

999
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,275
- Boris. For our children.
- We don't have any.

1000
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:47,675
- For our parents.
- They don't have children.

1001
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:49,677
- Well, I'm gonna kill him.
- Sonja.

1002
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:51,677
- I am.
- No. All right. Look,

1003
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:54,837
pull the carriage out front. I'll go kill him.

1004
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:06,234
Look at him. If I don't kill him,
he'll make war all through Europe.

1005
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:09,151
But murder?

1006
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:11,794
What would Socrates say?

1007
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:14,115
All those Greeks were homosexuals.

1008
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:17,194
Boy, they must have had
some wild parties.

1009
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:20,710
I bet they all took a house together
on Crete for the summer.

1010
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:23,149
(a) Socrates is a man.

1011
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:25,714
(b) All men are mortal.

1012
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:28,149
(c) All men are Socrates.

1013
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:31,035
That means all men are homosexuals.

1014
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:33,916
I'm not a homosexual.

1015
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:36,998
Once, some Cossacks whistled at me.

1016
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:41,878
I happen to have the kind of body
that excites both persuasions.

1017
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,798
But, you know,
some men are heterosexual,

1018
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:49,755
and some men are bisexual,
and some men don't think about sex at all.

1019
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:51,836
They become lawyers.

1020
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:55,592
My problem is that
I see both sides of every issue.

1021
01:09:55,720 --> 01:10:00,157
I'm too logical.
You know, the world is not logical.

1022
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:04,068
If it was logical, how would Old Nehamkin
be younger than Young Nehamkin?

1023
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:07,317
I knew there was something crazy
about that when I was a kid,

1024
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:10,989
but every time I said something,
they'd smack me. So, you know,

1025
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:16,399
I'm just racked with guilt
and I'm consumed with remorse

1026
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:19,592
and stricken with suffering
for the human race.

1027
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:21,870
And not only that, but I'm developing

1028
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,037
a herpes on my lip here
that is really killing me.

1029
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:29,276
What to do?

1030
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:46,629
Arrest this man for murder.
Fortunately, he only killed an impostor.

1031
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:49,399
I didn't do anything.
Hey, take it easy, will you?

1032
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:51,590
You're bending my throat.

1033
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:53,995
The Spanish government
will hear about this.

1034
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:57,476
Don Francisco is not a man
who takes these things lightly.

1035
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:59,511
There's Don Francisco now.

1036
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:02,438
There's been a mistake. I know - I made it.

1037
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:06,190
By some miracle, Sonja managed
to elude the French and escape.

1038
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:10,233
I, with my usual good luck, got thrown
in a damp cell to await execution -

1039
01:11:10,360 --> 01:11:11,998
my favourite pastime.

1040
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:15,317
Fortunately, it was a French jail,
so the food was not bad.

1041
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:18,992
My family was allowed to visit me.

1042
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:22,192
Remember that nice boy next door?
Raskolnikov?

1043
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:24,629
- Yeah?
- He killed two ladies.

1044
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:26,955
No! What a nasty story.

1045
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:31,039
Bobick told it to me. He heard it
from one of the Karamazov brothers.

1046
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:34,478
- He must have been possessed.
- Well, he was a raw youth.

1047
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:38,639
- Raw youth? He was an idiot.
- And he acted insulted and injured.

1048
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:42,316
- I hear he was a gambler.
- You know, he could be your double.

1049
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,070
Really? How novel.

1050
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:47,156
Son,

1051
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:51,559
for long years
I have saved this piece of land for you.

1052
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:54,956
- Look, it has a house on it.
- Yes, it's a nice little house.

1053
01:11:55,080 --> 01:11:57,230
You haven't wasted your life, I see.

1054
01:11:57,480 --> 01:12:00,199
Don't let any strangers come on it.

1055
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:02,276
No, no strangers.

1056
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:04,994
You're a major loon, you know that?

1057
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:10,751
Next year I'll expect
to build a guest house.

1058
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:14,589
Oh, a little tiny guest house
with a handball court

1059
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:17,951
and a little, little swimming pool
for fleas or something?

1060
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:22,312
Yes, well, you'll want to get
some rest in your rubber bedroom now.

1061
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:45,798
- Who are you?
- I am an angel of God.

1062
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:50,235
- You're kidding.
- Fear not, Boris.

1063
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:52,510
You have led a just life,

1064
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:56,076
and at the last minute,
before the execution,

1065
01:12:56,200 --> 01:12:58,953
the emperor plans to pardon you.

1066
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:00,913
Really?

1067
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:04,271
He will make a great personal show
of his generosity,

1068
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:07,758
and you will have learned your lesson,

1069
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:11,839
but you will not be executed.

1070
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:15,476
Then there is a God.

1071
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:17,556
Incredible.

1072
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:19,671
Moses was right.

1073
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:23,190
He that abideth in truth

1074
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:29,270
and will have frankincense and myrrh
smeared on his gums in abundance,

1075
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:32,238
and he shall dwell
in the house of the Lord

1076
01:13:32,360 --> 01:13:35,432
for six months with an option to buy.

1077
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:40,755
But the wicked man
shall have all kinds of problems.

1078
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:43,678
His tongue shall cleave
to the roof of his upper palate.

1079
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:47,076
And he shall speak like a woman,
if you watch him closely

1080
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:49,191
And he shall...

1081
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:52,676
The wicked man shall be
delivered into the hands of his enemy,

1082
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:55,314
whether they can
pay the delivery charge or not.

1083
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:57,396
And... Wait, I have more

1084
01:13:57,520 --> 01:13:58,635
about the wicked man.

1085
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:02,230
I shall walk through
the valley of the shadow of death...

1086
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:05,236
In fact, now that I think of it,

1087
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:08,318
I shall run through
the valley of the shadow of death,

1088
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:10,829
cos you get out of the valley
quicker that way.

1089
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:16,512
And he that hath clean hands
and a pure heart is OK in my book.

1090
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:21,316
But he that fools around with

1091
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:24,318
barnyard animals has got to be watched.

1092
01:14:24,440 --> 01:14:26,112
I thank you.

1093
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:32,556
All right, Grushenko, come on. Let's go.

1094
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,833
You guys are late.
I've been waitin' here since 6.30.

1095
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:38,520
- You're awfully cheerful.
- You know how it is

1096
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:40,870
when you're extra brave. Probably not.

1097
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:52,471
Busy day, huh?
Are you guys having a sale?

1098
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:56,999
No blindfold. That's for losers.
I like to see where the bullet hits.

1099
01:14:57,120 --> 01:15:00,954
I learned that during the war.
I was decorated, you know.

1100
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:03,550
Wonder what the emperor's doing today?

1101
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:07,308
- Ready.
- You wanna move closer? Don't miss.

1102
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:09,192
Looks bad on the report.

1103
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:10,878
Aim.

1104
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,309
Boy, the emperor's really cutting it close.

1105
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:16,557
What a flair for the dramatic...
that old slyboots.

1106
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:18,830
Fire.

1107
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:23,875
It's a very complicated situation,
cousin Sonja.

1108
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:27,556
I'm in love with Alexei. He loves Alicia.

1109
01:15:27,680 --> 01:15:30,638
Alicia's having an affair with Lev.

1110
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:33,636
Lev loves Tatiana.

1111
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:36,115
Tatiana loves Simkin.

1112
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:38,595
Simkin loves me.

1113
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:42,875
I love Simkin,
but in a different way than Alexei.

1114
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:46,991
Alexei loves Tatiana like a sister.

1115
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:51,398
Tatiana's sister loves Trigorian
like a brother.

1116
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:55,229
Trigorian's brother
is having an affair with my sister,

1117
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:58,716
who he likes physically,
but not spiritually.

1118
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:01,479
Natasha, it's getting a little late.

1119
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:03,591
The firm of Mishkin and Mishkin

1120
01:16:03,720 --> 01:16:07,110
is sleeping with
the firm of Taskov and Taskov.

1121
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:10,358
Natasha, to love is to suffer.

1122
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:13,153
To avoid suffering, one must not love.

1123
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:15,430
But then one suffers from not loving.

1124
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:17,755
Therefore, to love is to suffer.

1125
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:21,316
Not to love is to suffer.
To suffer is to suffer.

1126
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:23,908
To be happy is to love.

1127
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:28,033
To be happy, then, is to suffer,
but suffering makes one unhappy.

1128
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:31,232
Therefore, to be unhappy one must love,

1129
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:34,352
or love to suffer,
or suffer from too much happiness...

1130
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:37,233
I hope you're getting this down.

1131
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:40,314
I never want to marry.

1132
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:44,080
I just want to get divorced.

1133
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:47,552
Oh, look. It's Boris.

1134
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:54,033
Boris, what happened?

1135
01:16:54,160 --> 01:16:56,515
- I got screwed.
- How?

1136
01:16:56,640 --> 01:17:00,792
I don't know. Some vision said I was
going to get pardoned, and they shot me.

1137
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:03,514
You were my one great love.

1138
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:07,713
Thank you very much. I appreciate that.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm dead.

1139
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:10,474
- What's it like?
- What's it like?

1140
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:13,160
You know the chicken
at Tresky's restaurant?

1141
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:15,236
- Yeah.
- It's worse.

1142
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:22,995
Worse than the chicken at Tresky's.

1143
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:26,433
Oh, well, life must go on.

1144
01:17:27,240 --> 01:17:29,390
The last traces of the shimmering dusk

1145
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:33,069
are setting
behind the quickly darkening evening,

1146
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:35,395
and it's only noon.

1147
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:39,152
Soon we shall be covered by wheat.

1148
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:42,397
Did you say

1149
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:44,033
wheat?

1150
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:46,594
Wheat.

1151
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:50,198
Wheat.
I'm dead, they're talking about wheat.

1152
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:54,311
The question is,
have I learned anything about life?

1153
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:58,513
Only that human beings
are divided into mind and body.

1154
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:03,430
The mind embraces all the nobler
aspirations, like poetry and philosophy,

1155
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:05,755
but the body has all the fun.

1156
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:10,356
The important thing, I think,
is not to be bitter.

1157
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:14,314
You know, if it turns out that there
is a God, I don't think that he's evil.

1158
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:19,070
I think the worst you can say about him
is that basically he's an underachiever.

1159
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:22,829
After all, you know,
there are worse things in life than death.

1160
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:26,236
If you've ever spent an evening
with an insurance salesman,

1161
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:28,396
you know exactly what I mean.

1162
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:32,069
The key here, I think,
is to not think of death as an end,

1163
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:37,320
but think of it more as a very effective
way of cutting down on your expenses.

1164
01:18:38,240 --> 01:18:41,676
Regarding love...
You know, what can you say?

1165
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:45,873
It's not the quantity
of your sexual relations that count.

1166
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:47,752
It's the quality.

1167
01:18:47,880 --> 01:18:52,032
On the other hand, if the quantity
drops below once every eight months,

1168
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:54,276
I would definitely look into it.

1169
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:57,838
Well, that's about it for me, folks.

1170
01:18:57,960 --> 01:18:59,598
Goodbye.
