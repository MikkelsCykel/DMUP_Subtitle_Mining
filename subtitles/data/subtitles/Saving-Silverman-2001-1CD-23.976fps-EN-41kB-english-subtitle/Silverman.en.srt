1
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:07,067
Neil Diamond. Hot August night, 1972.

2
00:01:07,276 --> 00:01:12,197
That concert rocked and rolled.
I know because I was there.

3
00:01:17,703 --> 00:01:19,079
That's me.

4
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:23,709
My water broke.

5
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:27,963
Eversince then, I've had this
cosmic connection with Neil.

6
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:30,007
But this story isn't about Neil.

7
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:33,719
It's about me and my two pals,
Darren and J.D.

8
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:36,889
Best friends since fifth grade.

9
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:42,769
That's J.D. He's lactose intolerant.

10
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:46,899
And he's not very bright.

11
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:49,610
That's Darren Silverman.

12
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:51,361
He's a romantic.

13
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,990
But when it comes to women,
he's incredibly gullible.

14
00:02:01,914 --> 00:02:04,082
That's me, Wayne.

15
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,251
I'm loyal to my friends.

16
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,880
-I'd beat you up if you weren't a girl.
-Me too.

17
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:21,266
After that, I started working out.

18
00:02:22,184 --> 00:02:24,978
We stayed best friends
throughout high school.

19
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:27,731
I was the third-string quarterback.

20
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:31,777
J.D. became the school mascot.

21
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:36,073
Hey, what did you say
I didn't really motherfucking hear you.

22
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:39,034
Yeah, yeah you
Yeah you, yeah you, yeah you

23
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:43,330
And Darren joined
the cheerleading squad.

24
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:48,794
Oh, that's Sandy.

25
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:51,797
Yeah, Darren's always
had a thing for her.

26
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:54,800
When you're up against a Warbird

27
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,260
You're upside down!

28
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:59,429
Oh, that's Coach Norton.

29
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:03,058
He was a big influence in our lives.
He taught us many things.

30
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:05,644
Two things you got to remember, boys.

31
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:09,565
Number one: Stay away from women.

32
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:12,651
All they want from you
is your man juice.

33
00:03:12,985 --> 00:03:13,986
Now...

34
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:19,366
...if you get any urges that you can't
suppress with hard liquor, use this.

35
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,829
-Oh, number two....
-Sportsmanship.

36
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,330
Sportsmanship.

37
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:27,457
Sportsmanship.

38
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:32,504
You fairy wimp fruit bag!

39
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:34,214
You suck!

40
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:39,845
Le Fessier! Get out there!

41
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,681
I'm just gonna get my helmet.

42
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:45,475
Hey, guys! Guys, I'm in!

43
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:48,562
-See, he's going in!
-Oh, my God!

44
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:52,649
Go, Wayne! Go, Wayne!

45
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:55,986
Blue 48! Blue 48!

46
00:03:56,195 --> 00:03:57,696
Go! Set!

47
00:03:57,905 --> 00:03:58,989
Hike!

48
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:10,000
But now we're all grown-up.

49
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:22,262
J.D. is rapidly working his way
up the ladder at Subway.

50
00:04:22,638 --> 00:04:24,932
Recently he was promoted...

51
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:29,019
...to temporary second assistant manager
in charge of training.

52
00:04:29,228 --> 00:04:31,813
Okay, McNugent,
let's see what you got.

53
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:37,152
I've been working on them for 8 weeks.
I present the future of Subway.

54
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:38,612
Bellston...

55
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:41,865
...three sizes of bevy are small,
medium and what?

56
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:46,537
-Big?
-Like we practiced. You can do this.

57
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:48,038
L....

58
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:55,087
Long!

59
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,297
Okay, we'll come back to you.

60
00:04:57,506 --> 00:05:00,259
This guy's my stinkiest student
by far.

61
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:02,261
Trimball, let's see your sub.

62
00:05:04,096 --> 00:05:06,682
No, no. Meat on the inside,
bread outside.

63
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:10,060
Okay, take it away.

64
00:05:10,269 --> 00:05:12,020
Take it away!

65
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:16,275
Don't judge me on those two guys.
This next guy's my protégé.

66
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:20,362
He's top of his class, and for his
thesis he made a party sub.

67
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,448
Heston, where's the party sub?

68
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,505
Darren is a social director
at a retirement home.

69
00:05:38,714 --> 00:05:39,715
B-17.

70
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:41,508
Bingo.

71
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,385
Bingo.

72
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:45,137
Abe...

73
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:48,599
...pull your pants up
or no more Matlock.

74
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,688
I started my own business.

75
00:05:57,816 --> 00:05:59,526
What are we dealing with here?

76
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:02,446
I don't know, but it sounds big.

77
00:06:04,156 --> 00:06:05,908
Stay back. I'm going in.

78
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:13,165
Careful, sonny.

79
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:21,715
So you're causing
all this trouble, huh?

80
00:06:21,924 --> 00:06:22,925
Come here.

81
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:25,761
Hey there. Hello.

82
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,683
Here's the ferocious beast, huh?

83
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:35,270
Hey, where's your mommy?

84
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:39,608
Get off! Get it off!

85
00:06:52,955 --> 00:06:54,540
Is it dead?

86
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:55,874
No.

87
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,877
But she is in one deep coon coma.

88
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:14,351
Stop it!

89
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:19,439
But we all have one mystical thing
in common: Our love for Neil.

90
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:22,401
That's ourband,
Diamonds in the Rough.

91
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:19,625
Hey, I'm Darren.

92
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:20,876
Sophie.

93
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:23,670
Do you, maybe, want to grab
a drink with me?

94
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:26,173
I'm sorry. I'm involved.

95
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:28,133
With a real entertainer.

96
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:41,647
I can't believe I got blown off again.
I'll never meet the right girl.

97
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:44,399
You don't want
a chick who'd fuck a mime.

98
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:48,070
Dude, what does a mime look like
when it's having sex anyway?

99
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:49,738
It's probably like:

100
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:54,493
"l'm a mime. I'm a mime."

101
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,662
Hey, mimes don't talk.

102
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:01,750
They do when they're off duty.

103
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:06,088
It's not her. It's all women.

104
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:10,092
I'm really afraid that
there's nobody out there for me.

105
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,177
The only girl I ever loved...

106
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:14,805
...walked out of my life years ago.

107
00:09:15,264 --> 00:09:16,431
Sandy Perkus.

108
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,100
-Rememberher?
-Smile.

109
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:20,185
Her family was with the circus.

110
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:21,979
Her dad was The Strong Man.

111
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:24,022
Hermom was The Bearded Lady.

112
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:26,275
Herbrother was The Dog-faced Boy.

113
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:31,446
Before I mustered the courage
to ask her out, she moved away.

114
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,950
You know, I truly believe...

115
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:39,621
...that there is a one and only
someone for everyone.

116
00:09:39,955 --> 00:09:41,331
And Sandy...

117
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,458
...Sandy Perkus...

118
00:09:45,127 --> 00:09:47,045
...was my one and only.

119
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:50,340
Man, that is so romantic.

120
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,843
Oh, my God!
Look at that juicy piece of ass.

121
00:09:56,847 --> 00:09:58,390
What do you think of her?

122
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:00,100
-Who?
-Right there.

123
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,685
In the red?

124
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,397
-Yeah, she's gorgeous.
-Go talk to her.

125
00:10:05,606 --> 00:10:07,316
-No.
-Okay, I'll do it for you.

126
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:09,026
What? Hey, wait.

127
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:12,696
Hi. I'm Wayne.

128
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:15,032
-No.
-No, you don't understand.

129
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:16,783
I'm not hitting on you.

130
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:18,035
Back off.

131
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:21,246
I just want to tell you
about my buddy, Darren.

132
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:23,165
He's smart, he's sensitive--

133
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:25,501
-I don't care.
-He'd make a great husband.

134
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:27,711
-I don't want to meet him.
-Great.

135
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:34,301
Dude, she wants you.
She thinks you're really cute.

136
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:36,094
-Really?
-Yeah, she's like:

137
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:38,972
"Oh, I'm so excited to meet him,"
and everything.

138
00:10:39,223 --> 00:10:40,682
-Are you sure?
-Totally!

139
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:42,893
Get down there and make your move.

140
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:45,521
I don't know.

141
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:46,730
Come on!

142
00:10:46,939 --> 00:10:49,274
-Carpe poon!
-Really?

143
00:10:51,902 --> 00:10:54,780
-Okay, I'll do it.
-All right!

144
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:04,206
I'm Darren.

145
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:10,587
Darren. My friend said
you wanted to meet me.

146
00:11:10,796 --> 00:11:11,964
He lied.

147
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:14,508
That's a good one.

148
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,803
No, seriously.
I don't want to meet you.

149
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:28,188
My friend must have been mistaken.

150
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:32,526
I'm really sorry to bother you.

151
00:11:37,406 --> 00:11:38,866
Let me guess.

152
00:11:39,575 --> 00:11:43,036
That jerk tried to get into your pants
with some tacky line.

153
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:44,746
I'm not like that.

154
00:11:44,997 --> 00:11:46,415
I use magic.

155
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:48,333
Beat it, baldy.

156
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,295
Okay, good stuff.
Tough crowd. I like that.

157
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:53,463
I have here two...

158
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:55,883
...ordinary metal rings.

159
00:11:56,091 --> 00:11:58,010
You and me.

160
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,639
I love you.

161
00:12:03,891 --> 00:12:05,392
Sorry, I forgot my beer.

162
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:09,479
This is my boyfriend, Darren.
So hit the bricks, porky.

163
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:12,274
Okay. Nice to meet you, Darren.

164
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:13,483
Satan.

165
00:12:17,863 --> 00:12:20,365
I'm sorry about
hitting on you before--

166
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:22,367
-You should be.
-I am. I am.

167
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:25,454
I just, I wasn't thinking in....

168
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:29,541
You're so beautiful, and I....

169
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,461
I'm sorry.

170
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:36,215
So make up for it. Buy me a drink.

171
00:12:37,049 --> 00:12:39,218
-Yeah. Okay.
-I'll have a Scotch.

172
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:42,262
Give the lady a Scotch,
and I'll have another beer.

173
00:12:42,471 --> 00:12:45,557
-He'll have a gin and tonic.
-Make that a gin and tonic.

174
00:12:49,061 --> 00:12:52,397
Can you believe he hooked up
with the queen of all hotties?

175
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:55,359
They're just having a drink together.

176
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:59,112
It's not like they're
going steady or anything.

177
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:04,451
It's midnight.
You know what that means?

178
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,620
No. What?

179
00:13:06,829 --> 00:13:08,622
It's our six-week anniversary.

180
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:13,085
-Did you get me anything?
-No.

181
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:15,045
That's okay. That's okay.

182
00:13:15,254 --> 00:13:16,713
No big deal. But...

183
00:13:18,257 --> 00:13:19,675
...I...

184
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:22,678
...got you a little something.

185
00:13:24,346 --> 00:13:26,181
Thanks. That's really nice.

186
00:13:32,104 --> 00:13:34,439
You know, I've been thinking.

187
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:39,611
We've been together for a while now...

188
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,155
...and it seems like
maybe it's time...

189
00:13:43,824 --> 00:13:47,452
...we get a little more intimate.

190
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:50,998
Are you saying you want to have sex?

191
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,459
Yeah, I am.

192
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:58,589
I don't believe in premarital sex.
I'd rather not cheapen what we have.

193
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:02,092
Of course. Of course not.
Me neither.

194
00:14:02,301 --> 00:14:04,261
-So it's best to wait.
-You're right.

195
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:07,848
I think-- I mean, you're--
It's best.

196
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:10,142
But...

197
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:12,895
...that doesn't mean that we can't...

198
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:15,939
...pleasure each other in other ways.

199
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,614
I got you.

200
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:25,365
Oh, I got you.

201
00:14:37,294 --> 00:14:39,463
That was really great.

202
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:41,006
Thanks.

203
00:14:43,342 --> 00:14:45,719
That got me pretty excited.

204
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:48,889
That's nice.

205
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:53,685
I mean, I wouldn't mind if someone
did that to me.

206
00:14:54,144 --> 00:14:57,022
Oh, I get it.
You want me to go down on you.

207
00:14:59,441 --> 00:15:01,527
I would love to, but I can't.

208
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:04,404
I have very, very sensitive gums.

209
00:15:07,074 --> 00:15:10,285
You have gums--
It's a medical condition.

210
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:14,581
I wouldn't want to cause you
any pain, baby. No.

211
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:16,708
You're so sweet.

212
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:26,885
You know, there are other ways to give
me pleasure without using your mouth.

213
00:15:27,219 --> 00:15:30,222
Oh, God, I am so inconsiderate.
I'm sorry.

214
00:15:30,472 --> 00:15:33,725
No, that's fine. That's fine.

215
00:15:38,522 --> 00:15:40,023
Have fun.

216
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:46,864
-Watch your head.
-This place is a dump.

217
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:50,242
I really don't want to do this.

218
00:15:51,243 --> 00:15:56,039
It'll be great. It's our Sunday ritual
and I want you to be part of it.

219
00:15:56,248 --> 00:16:00,377
I want you to get to know these guys.
You'll love them, honey.

220
00:16:01,587 --> 00:16:05,966
-Yeah, buddy. What's up, dude?
-What's up, J.D.?

221
00:16:06,216 --> 00:16:09,136
Judy, awesome to meet you.

222
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:10,596
Judith.

223
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:13,891
Judith. And a beer bong for the lady?

224
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:16,018
-No.
-Totally cool.

225
00:16:16,226 --> 00:16:18,437
No peer pressure.

226
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:28,071
Judith rules. Sorry. Come on in.

227
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:30,490
Check it out. Chewie.

228
00:16:32,326 --> 00:16:33,660
You want a drink?

229
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:36,079
-Scotch on the rocks.
-You want ice?

230
00:16:36,288 --> 00:16:38,248
I'll help you with that.

231
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,919
Hey, Judith.
Can I give you the grand tour?

232
00:16:42,503 --> 00:16:45,464
Let's start right here
in the "Hall o' Neil."

233
00:16:45,756 --> 00:16:49,635
This is Neil, '74. Check this out.

234
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:53,847
This is a set list
from the Millennium Concert. Look:

235
00:16:54,097 --> 00:16:56,433
Signed by Neil. Got that on eBay.

236
00:16:57,267 --> 00:16:58,769
Looks like a Xerox.

237
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:02,356
No. This cost a lot of money.
Check this out.

238
00:17:02,606 --> 00:17:05,025
-I think you got taken.
-Ready?

239
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:06,652
This shirt...

240
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,654
...was worn by Neil...

241
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:11,657
...in concert.

242
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:14,284
Check it out. We snuck backstage...

243
00:17:14,493 --> 00:17:18,038
...and totally stole it from him
while he was taking a whiz.

244
00:17:18,247 --> 00:17:21,250
In my profession, we call
your obsession with Neil...

245
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,794
...a delusional projection fantasy.

246
00:17:24,002 --> 00:17:28,632
Yeah, sure. But he's America's
greatest songwriter and he's our hero.

247
00:17:28,841 --> 00:17:31,426
And he's playing the Forum
in two weeks.

248
00:17:31,635 --> 00:17:36,181
Of course, we can't go because
of the whole restraining order thing.

249
00:17:44,565 --> 00:17:46,817
Neil, I love you!

250
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:48,068
You again!

251
00:17:52,573 --> 00:17:54,283
Neil! Where are you going?

252
00:17:54,491 --> 00:17:58,412
I want to party with you.
I want to party with you!

253
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:00,414
Game's on.

254
00:18:00,414 --> 00:18:01,665
Game's on.

255
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:06,587
-Give me the remote.
-I want to go.

256
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:08,714
-Give me a beer.
-We just got here.

257
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:10,382
These guys are pigs.

258
00:18:10,591 --> 00:18:13,010
Come on. No, they're not that--

259
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:15,929
Hey! What are you doing?

260
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:20,392
Dude, if you get the nachos
stuck together, that's one nacho.

261
00:18:20,601 --> 00:18:25,189
Okay, look. Why don't we just stay
for a little bit, okay?

262
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:28,150
Oh, take mine. Take mine.

263
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,152
Give her the old sweep-a-roo.

264
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,655
Old Ethel. We've been through
a lot of games together.

265
00:18:33,906 --> 00:18:35,199
Enjoy.

266
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:39,036
I'll help you.
She has multiple reclining positions.

267
00:18:39,244 --> 00:18:41,205
-I can sit forward.
-It's stuck.

268
00:18:41,872 --> 00:18:43,790
-It's fine.
-Takes a little muscle.

269
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:46,668
Come on, you fucking piece of shit.

270
00:18:46,877 --> 00:18:49,046
-I don't need--
-It's no trouble.

271
00:18:50,714 --> 00:18:51,673
Are you okay?

272
00:18:51,882 --> 00:18:54,635
I'm sorry. That hardly ever happens.

273
00:18:54,885 --> 00:18:57,137
You know what? I think I-- Yep.

274
00:18:57,387 --> 00:19:00,307
It's the lug nut. Fixed it.
Please have a seat.

275
00:19:01,308 --> 00:19:02,809
I'll stand.

276
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,811
I'm a--

277
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:09,983
-Sorry.
-Get me something.

278
00:19:13,612 --> 00:19:17,074
So Darren tells me
you're a psychologist.

279
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:19,952
-That's right.
-Interesting.

280
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,745
I'm in a related field.

281
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:23,413
Really? What's that?

282
00:19:23,705 --> 00:19:25,415
Pest and rodent removal.

283
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:27,793
How is that related?

284
00:19:28,502 --> 00:19:29,795
We both help people.

285
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:33,131
While you deal with their emotional
and intellectual needs...

286
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:36,677
...I protect them from gophers,
coons, roaches, silverfish....

287
00:19:36,927 --> 00:19:38,136
He launched it.

288
00:19:38,846 --> 00:19:40,138
Touchdown!

289
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:55,153
I don't want you to see
Wayne or J.D. ever again, Darren!

290
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:57,114
But they're my best friends.

291
00:19:57,364 --> 00:20:01,493
You're getting new friends, and you're
quitting that bullshit band.

292
00:20:01,869 --> 00:20:06,165
I know you're upset. I do.
But I am not dropping Wayne and J.D...

293
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:08,458
...and I'm not quitting the band.

294
00:20:09,001 --> 00:20:11,170
Okay, fine. No more sex.

295
00:20:11,587 --> 00:20:12,546
What?

296
00:20:12,713 --> 00:20:14,715
You're not allowed to go down on me
for one month.

297
00:20:14,923 --> 00:20:16,008
No, Judith, please--

298
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:19,845
Don't make me take away
your masturbation privileges.

299
00:20:41,533 --> 00:20:45,496
You go, boys. You sing this song.
You know it. Come on, boys. Sing it!

300
00:20:45,704 --> 00:20:48,165
-Sing it!
-This blows, man.

301
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:52,544
Judith's out of control.
We gotta do something.

302
00:20:52,753 --> 00:20:55,839
Besides ruining the band,
what else has she done?

303
00:20:56,048 --> 00:20:59,468
Ever since she moved in with him,
she's controlled his life.

304
00:20:59,676 --> 00:21:02,930
She didn't like his ass.
Made him get butt-cheek implants.

305
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:10,604
I thought his ass looked tighter.

306
00:21:10,854 --> 00:21:12,606
Check this out. Last night...

307
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:15,526
...torched his Neil Diamond albums.

308
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:17,277
She torched Neil?

309
00:21:23,617 --> 00:21:25,494
You're right. She's a monster.

310
00:21:25,702 --> 00:21:27,579
Two, three, four.

311
00:21:45,931 --> 00:21:47,516
-Hey!
-Yes!

312
00:21:47,724 --> 00:21:50,102
-Hey, guys, sorry I'm late.
-It's all right.

313
00:21:50,269 --> 00:21:53,063
I only have a minute.
I have to wax Judith's legs.

314
00:21:53,272 --> 00:21:55,732
-We miss you.
-We never see you anymore.

315
00:21:55,941 --> 00:21:57,359
I know, I'm sorry...

316
00:21:57,568 --> 00:22:00,904
...but I've just been so happy
spending time with Judith.

317
00:22:01,113 --> 00:22:03,323
Plus, my relationship
counseling sessions--

318
00:22:03,532 --> 00:22:04,616
Counseling?

319
00:22:04,825 --> 00:22:07,703
Yeah. I go two hours,
three times a week.

320
00:22:07,911 --> 00:22:09,621
Oh. Who's your counselor?

321
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:10,873
Judith.

322
00:22:11,081 --> 00:22:13,292
We don't think she's right for you.

323
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,002
Break up with her.

324
00:22:15,252 --> 00:22:17,796
She's ruining our lives and yours.

325
00:22:18,005 --> 00:22:20,090
This graph should
illustrate our point.

326
00:22:20,299 --> 00:22:24,678
Before Judith, our fun level
was at an all-time high: 93.

327
00:22:24,928 --> 00:22:26,680
It is now an eight.

328
00:22:26,889 --> 00:22:28,974
Band numbers have
plunged dramatically.

329
00:22:29,183 --> 00:22:33,896
Girls, never very high, at nine.
But look now. Two!

330
00:22:34,104 --> 00:22:36,190
This has led to increased wanking off.

331
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,941
I'm chafing.

332
00:22:39,276 --> 00:22:41,403
Shit, I gotta go home
and heat the wax.

333
00:22:41,612 --> 00:22:45,324
Guys, listen.
Thanks for your concern, really.

334
00:22:45,491 --> 00:22:49,286
I miss you too. But it was great
seeing you, all right?

335
00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:58,295
That guy's in serious trouble.

336
00:22:59,129 --> 00:23:01,089
We need to save him.

337
00:23:03,383 --> 00:23:04,843
Sorry to bother you.

338
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:06,637
What are you doing here?

339
00:23:07,304 --> 00:23:09,556
We want to apologize
for the beer shower.

340
00:23:09,806 --> 00:23:11,725
And the salsa bath. That was bad.

341
00:23:11,975 --> 00:23:15,187
-Get the hell out of here.
-Just give us a minute, okay?

342
00:23:15,395 --> 00:23:17,439
My rate is $200 an hour.

343
00:23:18,315 --> 00:23:19,983
Do you have any money?

344
00:23:20,651 --> 00:23:22,152
I got some of that.

345
00:23:24,404 --> 00:23:26,240
Just give me the big bills.

346
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,784
Six. Is that all you have?

347
00:23:28,992 --> 00:23:30,828
Thirty. $7.38.

348
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:36,208
Two and a half minutes.

349
00:23:36,917 --> 00:23:40,796
We don't want you seeing Darren.
We don't think you're right for him.

350
00:23:41,004 --> 00:23:42,214
The band needs him.

351
00:23:42,381 --> 00:23:45,634
-But we're prepared to buy you off.
-With what?

352
00:23:47,427 --> 00:23:48,929
My house.

353
00:23:49,179 --> 00:23:50,722
Okay? Look.

354
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:55,978
My grandma here? She was born in this
house, is buried in the back yard.

355
00:23:56,562 --> 00:23:57,855
There's my mom...

356
00:23:58,063 --> 00:24:00,524
...there's my dad and there's me.

357
00:24:01,191 --> 00:24:04,736
My dad was dropping me
on my head. But...

358
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:08,740
...we're willing to sign
this over to you...

359
00:24:08,949 --> 00:24:11,535
...if you just agree
not to see Darren.

360
00:24:11,743 --> 00:24:14,413
I don't want your shitty house
or your dead grandma.

361
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,749
I'll throw J.D. in.
He doesn't look like much...

362
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:19,418
...but he's hung like a horse.

363
00:24:19,626 --> 00:24:20,919
It's true.

364
00:24:21,128 --> 00:24:24,298
Look, Darren's mine.
There's nothing you can do about it.

365
00:24:24,506 --> 00:24:28,218
I own him. He does whatever I say.
I'm in complete control of him.

366
00:24:28,427 --> 00:24:31,263
He's my puppet
and I'm his puppet master.

367
00:24:31,471 --> 00:24:33,182
You're not taking Darren away!

368
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:34,474
Just try to stop me.

369
00:24:37,019 --> 00:24:38,729
One round, winner takes Darren.

370
00:24:38,937 --> 00:24:40,022
-You're on.
-Kick her ass.

371
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:41,315
Go.

372
00:24:42,316 --> 00:24:45,819
You've got quite a grip.
You must be a heavy masturbator.

373
00:24:46,028 --> 00:24:48,697
My guess is three times a day?

374
00:24:48,906 --> 00:24:50,908
I bet you're a premature ejaculator.

375
00:24:51,116 --> 00:24:52,951
You start off with a big bang.

376
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,454
Before you know it, you're limp.

377
00:24:55,913 --> 00:24:59,124
-I win, you lose. Now get out.
-God!

378
00:25:09,092 --> 00:25:10,511
Hey, check it out.

379
00:25:14,348 --> 00:25:15,766
Hey, baby.

380
00:25:16,016 --> 00:25:18,352
Hello, ladies.

381
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:20,312
So how much?

382
00:25:20,854 --> 00:25:24,316
Fifty bucks for you,
and 200 for your friend.

383
00:25:26,485 --> 00:25:28,153
-Okay.
-All right.

384
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:31,490
I want you to laugh
like he just said something.

385
00:25:33,408 --> 00:25:34,952
Perfect!

386
00:25:35,285 --> 00:25:38,497
Get this one.
Be like this. Like this.

387
00:25:38,705 --> 00:25:39,540
Douche, douche.

388
00:25:39,915 --> 00:25:41,959
Yeah, you. Slap his ass.

389
00:25:44,628 --> 00:25:46,630
That's not sexy.

390
00:25:56,056 --> 00:25:57,724
Watch it.

391
00:26:00,352 --> 00:26:02,145
You're moving my guy!

392
00:26:08,527 --> 00:26:10,445
Lookit. Lookit.

393
00:26:15,325 --> 00:26:16,535
Good.

394
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:21,081
-Awesome.
-Check this out.

395
00:26:24,751 --> 00:26:28,088
Mail, check. Go. Don't look back.

396
00:26:29,256 --> 00:26:30,257
Hurry up. Come on.

397
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:33,260
Hi, Judith. How's it going?

398
00:26:33,468 --> 00:26:36,638
Not so good. Look at these.

399
00:26:39,183 --> 00:26:40,517
Oh, my God.

400
00:26:42,561 --> 00:26:43,770
He's sick.

401
00:26:43,979 --> 00:26:44,855
He's perverted.

402
00:26:45,063 --> 00:26:48,233
-He's cheating on you.
-With two chicks.

403
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,652
I don't know. I guess I'd dump him?

404
00:26:50,861 --> 00:26:52,863
-Oh, totally.
-Right?

405
00:26:53,405 --> 00:26:57,201
Do you guys notice anything weird
about these photos?

406
00:26:57,409 --> 00:26:59,578
No, that's Darren, all right.

407
00:27:02,289 --> 00:27:04,708
Darren doesn't have a tattoo.

408
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:07,836
Nice try, idiots.

409
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:10,923
If I ever see you near Darren again...

410
00:27:11,381 --> 00:27:12,799
...I'll kill you.

411
00:27:24,478 --> 00:27:28,899
Thanks for meeting me here.
I have something important to say.

412
00:27:29,149 --> 00:27:31,068
Oh, man. You broke up?

413
00:27:31,318 --> 00:27:32,611
No.

414
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:37,908
Out of the blue,
Judith proposed to me. We're engaged.

415
00:27:38,158 --> 00:27:41,161
-What?
-Dude, congratulations.

416
00:27:42,329 --> 00:27:45,457
Starting next week,
I'll be Mr. Darren Fessbeggler.

417
00:27:45,666 --> 00:27:49,002
Right, because you're gonna take
her last name, huh?

418
00:27:49,211 --> 00:27:50,254
Yeah, well...

419
00:27:50,504 --> 00:27:53,966
...Judith feels, and I think she's got
a really good point here...

420
00:27:54,174 --> 00:27:57,469
...that it's sexist for the woman
to take the man's last name.

421
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:00,722
Anyway, it's too late to change it.

422
00:28:00,931 --> 00:28:03,809
We've already ordered
the monogrammed towels.

423
00:28:04,309 --> 00:28:05,769
Darren.

424
00:28:06,103 --> 00:28:07,396
Sandy?

425
00:28:07,604 --> 00:28:08,897
Sandy Perkus.

426
00:28:09,106 --> 00:28:12,317
Oh, my God, Darren.
It's been so long.

427
00:28:12,526 --> 00:28:13,944
Yeah, it has.

428
00:28:15,195 --> 00:28:16,238
Hey, it's Wayne.

429
00:28:16,446 --> 00:28:18,991
High school, remember? You remember?

430
00:28:25,873 --> 00:28:29,084
Right! The senior talent show.

431
00:28:29,293 --> 00:28:32,171
Yeah, you were booed off the stage.

432
00:28:33,422 --> 00:28:34,798
That was me.

433
00:28:35,048 --> 00:28:37,342
Yep. Sandy, remember me?
J.D. McNugent?

434
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:39,761
I went to the prom...

435
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:42,973
...with a tuxedo painted
on my naked body.

436
00:28:43,182 --> 00:28:45,267
Oh, I guess I missed it.

437
00:28:45,642 --> 00:28:50,022
I spilled a drink and the paint ran
and everyone could see my dong.

438
00:28:50,397 --> 00:28:52,900
It doesn't ring a bell.

439
00:28:54,234 --> 00:28:57,821
Remember, in science, I was lighting
farts with the Bunsen burner...

440
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:00,324
...and I singed my ball sac?

441
00:29:01,909 --> 00:29:02,951
No.

442
00:29:03,202 --> 00:29:06,830
Man. I still can't grow hair
on my left nut.

443
00:29:07,289 --> 00:29:08,832
Sucks.

444
00:29:10,209 --> 00:29:12,169
So how are you?

445
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:15,130
Great. Great.
I just moved back to town.

446
00:29:15,339 --> 00:29:16,965
Oh, wow, that's great.

447
00:29:17,758 --> 00:29:21,637
Gosh, you know, I have to go,
but it was great seeing you.

448
00:29:21,845 --> 00:29:24,431
Yeah, same here. Me too.

449
00:29:27,017 --> 00:29:28,393
-See you.
-Take care.

450
00:29:28,602 --> 00:29:29,728
-Okay, bye.
-Awesome.

451
00:29:29,937 --> 00:29:32,356
Yeah, bye. Bye.

452
00:29:34,608 --> 00:29:35,984
Oh, my God.

453
00:29:36,193 --> 00:29:37,694
-This is it!
-What?

454
00:29:37,945 --> 00:29:42,074
It's your big chance. Sandy Perkus
has just walked back into your life.

455
00:29:42,616 --> 00:29:45,994
You even said so yourself.
She was your one and only someone!

456
00:29:46,203 --> 00:29:49,414
She used to be.
Now Judith is my one and only someone.

457
00:29:49,623 --> 00:29:52,626
I'll talk to you guys later. Okay?

458
00:29:53,293 --> 00:29:56,296
Isn't "one and only" like, one...

459
00:29:57,673 --> 00:29:59,091
...and only?

460
00:30:06,223 --> 00:30:08,809
-Here's your drink.
-Where's the lemon wedge?

461
00:30:09,017 --> 00:30:11,520
We're out of lemons,
but I'll run to the store--

462
00:30:11,728 --> 00:30:14,731
Forget it. I want you to meet
two exciting people.

463
00:30:15,524 --> 00:30:18,277
Brett is a tax attorney,
and Clayton's a CPA.

464
00:30:18,485 --> 00:30:20,988
Wow, that is exciting.

465
00:30:21,155 --> 00:30:22,781
This is my fiancé, Darren.

466
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:24,408
-Pleased to meet you.
-Same.

467
00:30:24,616 --> 00:30:26,326
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

468
00:30:26,535 --> 00:30:27,828
Excuse me, I'll get it.

469
00:30:34,459 --> 00:30:38,172
Is Darren here?
I think he left his Vespa helmet.

470
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,381
What's going on?

471
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,800
We're having our engagement party.

472
00:30:42,009 --> 00:30:46,722
Oh, then I guess our invitations
must've been lost in the mail.

473
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:48,515
No.

474
00:30:48,765 --> 00:30:52,477
I think it's very possible
she didn't even send us invitations.

475
00:30:54,313 --> 00:30:56,940
-Thanks for stopping by.
-Who's Darren talking to?

476
00:30:57,357 --> 00:30:59,359
Those are his new friends.

477
00:31:02,488 --> 00:31:04,573
-I'll have a merlot.
-A spritzer.

478
00:31:05,282 --> 00:31:08,160
-We don't work here.
-You fooled me.

479
00:31:08,368 --> 00:31:11,038
-My name's Brett, this is Clayton.
-This is Darren.

480
00:31:11,246 --> 00:31:14,208
Yeah, we know who he is, Clayton.

481
00:31:14,374 --> 00:31:18,003
-Darren's our friend, Brett.
-We knew him first.

482
00:31:18,212 --> 00:31:20,047
Fuck you, replacement friend!

483
00:31:20,255 --> 00:31:22,883
Eat this, fake Wayne!

484
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:28,514
Stop it! Do something!

485
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:36,313
Get out of here!

486
00:31:43,737 --> 00:31:45,239
Hey, this isn't over yet!

487
00:31:45,447 --> 00:31:47,199
We're not giving up on Darren!

488
00:31:54,998 --> 00:31:57,376
She thinks this game is over.

489
00:31:57,584 --> 00:31:59,336
It's not over. No!

490
00:31:59,586 --> 00:32:02,881
But we are taking this into overtime!

491
00:32:03,924 --> 00:32:05,968
Yeah! Okay, strategy session.

492
00:32:06,468 --> 00:32:09,638
-Okay, our enemy is wicked.
-Dude, she's Freddy Krueger.

493
00:32:09,847 --> 00:32:11,598
-No, Damien.
-Dude, she's Vader.

494
00:32:11,807 --> 00:32:13,559
No, she is the Emperor!

495
00:32:13,767 --> 00:32:15,227
But with really great tits.

496
00:32:15,435 --> 00:32:18,814
Okay, now, Sandy?
That girl, she's a nice girl.

497
00:32:19,022 --> 00:32:20,899
-She's a sweetheart.
-Dude, a saint.

498
00:32:21,108 --> 00:32:22,401
-A goddess.
-A princess.

499
00:32:22,609 --> 00:32:25,445
You know what?
She's kind of like Mother Teresa.

500
00:32:25,654 --> 00:32:27,239
But with way better tits.

501
00:32:27,447 --> 00:32:30,909
And Darren loves Sandy
no matter what he says.

502
00:32:31,118 --> 00:32:32,077
Definitely.

503
00:32:32,286 --> 00:32:35,247
That's why we have to intervene
and fix the problem!

504
00:32:35,455 --> 00:32:37,457
-Definitely!
-All right!

505
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:41,879
We're gonna kidnap Judith
and set Darren up with Sandy.

506
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:45,757
What?

507
00:32:51,638 --> 00:32:54,016
The bat is leaving the cave.

508
00:32:54,808 --> 00:32:56,727
Roger that.

509
00:33:13,702 --> 00:33:17,289
Alarm system has been deactivated.
Out.

510
00:33:17,498 --> 00:33:18,999
Roger that.

511
00:33:19,875 --> 00:33:21,668
Dude, you don't have to do the--

512
00:33:21,877 --> 00:33:24,463
--sound. It already does that. Out.

513
00:33:24,671 --> 00:33:26,673
Copy that.
I'm not going to make the--

514
00:33:26,882 --> 00:33:29,635
--sound after I say stuff
from now on.

515
00:33:31,011 --> 00:33:32,137
Shady McNugent...

516
00:33:32,346 --> 00:33:33,639
...over and out.

517
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,433
That was the last one.

518
00:33:47,694 --> 00:33:50,739
-I'm scared. What if we get caught?
-Not gonna happen.

519
00:33:57,037 --> 00:33:58,664
I'm hungry.

520
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:00,666
We'll eat later.

521
00:34:00,874 --> 00:34:04,545
-Can we go to Happy Burger?
-Yes, after the kidnapping.

522
00:34:04,753 --> 00:34:07,047
I'm gonna get a Chubby Checker with--

523
00:34:08,924 --> 00:34:10,509
With cheese.

524
00:34:26,859 --> 00:34:28,318
What?

525
00:34:36,827 --> 00:34:41,081
You go downstairs and I'll check
upstairs. Do the Navy SEAL signals.

526
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:44,209
I only know the Air Force signals.

527
00:34:44,877 --> 00:34:46,461
I'll be on the lookout.

528
00:34:46,712 --> 00:34:47,963
God!

529
00:34:55,929 --> 00:34:58,724
-I haven't located heryet.
-Me neither.

530
00:34:59,391 --> 00:35:00,517
Keep checking.

531
00:35:01,101 --> 00:35:05,355
Wait a second. I think I see
something in the back of the refrig--

532
00:35:06,023 --> 00:35:07,566
In the back of the closet.

533
00:35:08,066 --> 00:35:09,276
Check it out.

534
00:35:09,776 --> 00:35:11,904
Nope. Coast is clear.

535
00:35:12,112 --> 00:35:16,575
I'll keep looking down here, buddy.
You keep an eye peeled up there.

536
00:35:33,926 --> 00:35:34,968
Oh, shit.

537
00:35:36,803 --> 00:35:37,804
What is it?

538
00:35:38,055 --> 00:35:40,724
I'm hit. I need backup.

539
00:35:41,642 --> 00:35:42,851
I'm coming.

540
00:35:46,271 --> 00:35:47,523
What happ--

541
00:36:14,049 --> 00:36:15,676
Help!

542
00:36:31,859 --> 00:36:33,777
Dead leg.

543
00:36:36,029 --> 00:36:37,823
Help me, Wayne.

544
00:36:44,663 --> 00:36:46,123
Oh, my God.

545
00:36:59,303 --> 00:37:02,514
Get the door. Get the door. Door.

546
00:37:33,504 --> 00:37:36,089
Darren, I'm leaving you.
We're finished. Done.

547
00:37:36,423 --> 00:37:38,509
Don't call, write, e-mail or fax.

548
00:37:38,717 --> 00:37:41,845
I never want to see your face
oryour fake butt again.

549
00:38:13,252 --> 00:38:14,419
Okay, get down there.

550
00:38:14,962 --> 00:38:16,922
Dude, wait. Why me?

551
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:21,051
Because you're guarding Judith.
I'm dealing with Darren and Sandy.

552
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:24,304
But when we let her go,
she'll be able to identify me.

553
00:38:24,555 --> 00:38:28,267
No. She won't be able to
because you'll be wearing this.

554
00:38:28,475 --> 00:38:32,479
But after we let her go, the cops will
look for a guy dressed as a bird.

555
00:38:32,729 --> 00:38:34,940
-So?
-So, what am I gonna wear to work?

556
00:38:35,148 --> 00:38:36,358
Your work clothes.

557
00:38:36,567 --> 00:38:38,610
But tomorrow's casual Friday.

558
00:38:39,153 --> 00:38:41,405
Get downstairs!

559
00:38:48,036 --> 00:38:49,329
Who the hell are you?

560
00:39:09,641 --> 00:39:12,436
Thanks for meeting me.
I called you out of the blue--

561
00:39:12,644 --> 00:39:16,607
That's okay. I love catching up
with old high school friends.

562
00:39:16,815 --> 00:39:18,650
-Are you single?
-Yes.

563
00:39:18,859 --> 00:39:22,988
Great. Look, I wanted to talk
to you about Darren Silverman.

564
00:39:23,197 --> 00:39:24,573
He's a really good guy.

565
00:39:24,823 --> 00:39:27,659
You know what?
He works with the elderly.

566
00:39:27,868 --> 00:39:29,119
Really?

567
00:39:29,495 --> 00:39:32,706
-That is so sweet.
-He still talks about you.

568
00:39:32,915 --> 00:39:33,916
There's something--

569
00:39:34,166 --> 00:39:37,711
He even writes poems about you.
In fact...

570
00:39:38,212 --> 00:39:39,505
...I think he loves you.

571
00:39:40,005 --> 00:39:42,382
Wayne, I'm gonna become a nun.

572
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,970
In a week, I take my final vows.

573
00:39:47,179 --> 00:39:50,557
I didn't even know
that you were religious.

574
00:39:50,766 --> 00:39:52,392
I wasn't in high school.

575
00:39:52,601 --> 00:39:56,355
But after I graduated,
I joined my parents in the circus.

576
00:39:56,563 --> 00:39:58,232
And I became a trapeze artist.

577
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,861
I fell in love
with mypartner, Luigi Panini.

578
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:07,032
Ladies and gentlemen,
the fabulous Luigi!

579
00:40:07,282 --> 00:40:10,035
And everything was perfect until....

580
00:40:10,202 --> 00:40:12,412
Talent scouts were in the audience.

581
00:40:12,746 --> 00:40:14,748
Luigi wanted to impress them.

582
00:40:14,957 --> 00:40:18,252
He was a great trapeze artist,
but he was completely vain.

583
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:21,338
And now Luigi will attempt
the most dangerous stunt...

584
00:40:21,547 --> 00:40:23,173
...in the history of trapeze...

585
00:40:23,382 --> 00:40:26,009
...the Quadruple Bierman.

586
00:40:41,775 --> 00:40:43,735
Luigi!

587
00:40:46,071 --> 00:40:48,115
-Wow.
-Yeah.

588
00:40:48,323 --> 00:40:52,452
After Luigi died,
I knew I would never love again.

589
00:40:52,661 --> 00:40:57,332
That's when I decided to devote my life
to serving God and helping others.

590
00:40:57,583 --> 00:41:01,461
So you haven't taken
your final vows yet, right?

591
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:06,675
-Right.
-So technically, you're not a nun yet.

592
00:41:06,925 --> 00:41:09,261
Well, no. I mean, not yet.

593
00:41:09,469 --> 00:41:12,264
So why not then just
have lunch with Darren?

594
00:41:14,641 --> 00:41:16,810
I can't figure out why Judith left.

595
00:41:17,019 --> 00:41:20,480
It doesn't make any sense.
She didn't even take her clothes.

596
00:41:20,689 --> 00:41:24,568
Maybe she went where she didn't
need clothes: a nudist colony.

597
00:41:24,776 --> 00:41:27,112
-I don't think so.
-Maybe she got kidnapped.

598
00:41:27,654 --> 00:41:29,531
-You think?
-No.

599
00:41:29,781 --> 00:41:31,867
Definitely not. That's impossible.

600
00:41:32,117 --> 00:41:35,370
It's like, why would that
happen in a world?

601
00:41:35,746 --> 00:41:37,414
Maybe she's a lesbo.

602
00:41:37,873 --> 00:41:38,790
Come on.

603
00:41:38,999 --> 00:41:41,084
Maybe she's a herm.

604
00:41:42,461 --> 00:41:44,421
-What?
-A hermaphrodite.

605
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:46,673
Little dick, little puss.

606
00:41:50,427 --> 00:41:52,721
-Guess who I bumped into today.
-Who?

607
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:56,433
Sandy Perkus,
and she wants to see you.

608
00:41:56,642 --> 00:41:59,520
-I'm engaged to Judith, Wayne.
-She dumped you, dude.

609
00:41:59,686 --> 00:42:02,689
Just have lunch with Sandy.
What's it gonna hurt?

610
00:42:02,856 --> 00:42:05,442
No way. Judith's coming back.

611
00:42:06,026 --> 00:42:07,361
What if she doesn't?

612
00:42:07,611 --> 00:42:10,614
As long as Judith's alive,
I'll never give up on her.

613
00:42:10,823 --> 00:42:12,449
Okay? Okay?

614
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:20,874
I got it. Crowbar me.

615
00:42:24,002 --> 00:42:25,128
Oh, my God.

616
00:42:25,379 --> 00:42:28,674
-What is it?
-This dead chick is really stacked.

617
00:42:34,054 --> 00:42:35,556
Okay, go, go. Go.

618
00:42:37,057 --> 00:42:39,059
-What are you doing?
-Jacket's caught.

619
00:42:39,226 --> 00:42:40,394
Take it off!

620
00:42:40,644 --> 00:42:42,229
I love this jacket!

621
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:43,981
Lose it!

622
00:43:00,998 --> 00:43:05,002
Damn! That was my favorite jacket.

623
00:43:08,881 --> 00:43:11,925
In a bizarre incident last night,
Judith Fessbeggler...

624
00:43:12,134 --> 00:43:14,928
...was incinerated beyond
recognition when her BMW...

625
00:43:15,179 --> 00:43:16,889
...careened offa cliff.

626
00:43:17,097 --> 00:43:21,518
Investigators have declared it an
accident. No foul play is suspected.

627
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,940
In unrelated news, the body of
deceased local Joan Snerd...

628
00:43:27,191 --> 00:43:31,778
...was dug up in a grave robbing last
night. Police arrested three Cubans.

629
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:46,418
-Why are you doing this?
-So you can eat and have clothes.

630
00:43:47,419 --> 00:43:49,129
No, why did you kidnap me?

631
00:43:49,379 --> 00:43:51,215
I'm not supposed to tell you.

632
00:43:51,465 --> 00:43:54,218
Oh, I get it.
The other guy's the boss.

633
00:43:55,761 --> 00:43:58,639
No, I make decisions too.

634
00:43:58,972 --> 00:44:00,724
I suggested that.

635
00:44:01,308 --> 00:44:02,684
An outhouse. Clever.

636
00:44:02,893 --> 00:44:03,852
Thanks.

637
00:44:04,061 --> 00:44:06,688
-You must be very well-educated.
-I suppose.

638
00:44:06,897 --> 00:44:08,899
-Ivy League?
-More or less.

639
00:44:09,107 --> 00:44:12,152
-Which one? Yale, Harvard, Princeton?
-S.U.

640
00:44:12,402 --> 00:44:13,821
Oh, Stanford University?

641
00:44:16,114 --> 00:44:18,075
Subway University.

642
00:44:18,325 --> 00:44:22,246
I knew someone who went there.
Did you know J.D. McNugent?

643
00:44:22,454 --> 00:44:26,291
No. No. Never heard
of such a person, ever.

644
00:44:27,835 --> 00:44:30,838
-See you later, J.D.
-Take it easy, Judith.

645
00:44:32,756 --> 00:44:34,383
Goddamn it!

646
00:44:34,591 --> 00:44:37,970
-She knows who we are?!
-There was nothing I could do.

647
00:44:38,178 --> 00:44:41,723
She used her super-intellect on me.
She's like Hannibal Lecter.

648
00:44:41,932 --> 00:44:45,769
-Great. Now we can't let her go.
-So, what are we going to do?

649
00:44:47,312 --> 00:44:48,564
-Coach.
-Coach!

650
00:44:48,772 --> 00:44:51,400
If it ain't my favorite
third-string quarterback...

651
00:44:51,608 --> 00:44:54,611
...and the best damn mascot
Wheaton High School ever had.

652
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:56,655
Lookit, he's still got it!

653
00:44:57,990 --> 00:45:01,493
It's good seeing you boys.
Thank you for coming to my trial.

654
00:45:01,702 --> 00:45:05,122
No problem. We were happy to act
as witnesses on your behalf.

655
00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:07,958
That ref blew.
He deserved what he got.

656
00:45:11,837 --> 00:45:13,130
Touchdown!

657
00:45:13,505 --> 00:45:15,841
No touchdown. He's out-of-bounds.

658
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:17,885
-What?!
-He's out-of-bounds.

659
00:45:32,566 --> 00:45:37,362
You think after you get out of prison
they'll let you get your old job back?

660
00:45:37,529 --> 00:45:40,324
Well, boys, I don't think so.

661
00:45:40,532 --> 00:45:42,284
So when will they let you out?

662
00:45:42,493 --> 00:45:46,038
Well, I've got an appeal pending,
but it doesn't look good.

663
00:45:46,246 --> 00:45:49,333
The victim's whiny
family's protesting.

664
00:45:49,541 --> 00:45:51,585
What's their damn problem?

665
00:45:52,211 --> 00:45:53,962
So, what brings you boys here?

666
00:45:54,171 --> 00:45:56,215
Well, coach, we need your advice.

667
00:45:56,423 --> 00:45:57,716
Okay, shoot.

668
00:45:57,925 --> 00:46:00,511
Darren fell in love
with this girl, Judith.

669
00:46:00,719 --> 00:46:03,722
-And we kidnapped her.
-Kill her.

670
00:46:04,348 --> 00:46:06,558
Wait a minute and let me finish.

671
00:46:06,767 --> 00:46:10,270
So we screwed up because now
she knows who we are.

672
00:46:10,521 --> 00:46:13,607
So we can't let her go,
or she'll turn us in.

673
00:46:13,857 --> 00:46:15,400
Is that everything?

674
00:46:18,362 --> 00:46:19,613
Kill her.

675
00:46:20,697 --> 00:46:22,157
We can't kill her.

676
00:46:22,366 --> 00:46:25,994
You can! Wheaton Warbirds can do
anything they put their minds to.

677
00:46:26,203 --> 00:46:29,456
But, coach, I mean, come on,
actually kill a person?

678
00:46:29,915 --> 00:46:32,417
What is it that I always said?

679
00:46:32,626 --> 00:46:35,170
If you can dream it, you can do it.

680
00:46:35,379 --> 00:46:36,421
Exactly.

681
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:40,843
You have the dream. All you have
to do is turn it into reality.

682
00:46:41,051 --> 00:46:42,678
-Okay.
-Thattaboy!

683
00:46:42,928 --> 00:46:44,763
Now, go on home and snuff her.

684
00:46:44,972 --> 00:46:47,224
-Come on, move.
-Thanks, coach.

685
00:46:53,021 --> 00:46:54,481
Where's your bird suit?

686
00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:57,442
I don't need it, because we're--

687
00:46:58,819 --> 00:47:01,697
Because we're gonna kill you. Right?

688
00:47:03,782 --> 00:47:05,701
You aren't going to shoot me.

689
00:47:05,909 --> 00:47:07,327
What makes you say that?

690
00:47:07,661 --> 00:47:09,204
Because you're not killers.

691
00:47:09,413 --> 00:47:10,497
Sure we are.

692
00:47:10,706 --> 00:47:12,124
You've never killed anyone.

693
00:47:12,332 --> 00:47:13,333
I killed a man once.

694
00:47:13,542 --> 00:47:14,501
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

695
00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:17,296
-Who?
-Kevin Beckley.

696
00:47:17,504 --> 00:47:20,507
You didn't kill Kevin Beckley.
He died in a car wreck.

697
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:24,845
-She doesn't know that. Goddamn it.
-You see?

698
00:47:25,053 --> 00:47:28,473
You guys have never killed anything
in your entire lives.

699
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:32,811
One time, this squirrel ran out
into the street and I ran over him...

700
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:37,566
...and he didn't die right then, but
I'm pretty sure he died right after.

701
00:47:38,275 --> 00:47:42,237
It doesn't matter if we've killed
or not! We're gonna do it right now!

702
00:47:42,446 --> 00:47:44,656
-Ready?!
-Ready.

703
00:47:46,867 --> 00:47:49,119
-Do it.
-I can't!

704
00:47:49,369 --> 00:47:50,746
Goddamn it!

705
00:47:59,922 --> 00:48:02,466
-Okay, it's Tuesday.
-So?

706
00:48:02,716 --> 00:48:04,760
So you're meeting Sandy for lunch.

707
00:48:04,968 --> 00:48:06,595
Can't you see I'm in mourning?

708
00:48:06,803 --> 00:48:10,265
But you promised you'd be there.
You gave her your word.

709
00:48:10,724 --> 00:48:12,434
I didn't even talk to her.

710
00:48:12,643 --> 00:48:14,853
Okay, I gave her your word.

711
00:48:15,062 --> 00:48:19,691
For God's sakes, when will you give up
this idea that I'll go out with Sandy?

712
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:22,194
When you go out with Sandy.

713
00:48:23,821 --> 00:48:25,489
Now, come on.

714
00:48:26,448 --> 00:48:29,576
Come on. Come on. Come on, come on.

715
00:48:39,294 --> 00:48:41,839
Come on! All right! Come on!

716
00:48:46,301 --> 00:48:48,971
Hey! Wow, you're wearing the--

717
00:48:49,179 --> 00:48:51,390
I'm training to become a nun.

718
00:48:51,598 --> 00:48:54,059
A nun. Well, that explains it.

719
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:57,396
-I hope it doesn't freak you out.
-No, it doesn't.

720
00:48:57,604 --> 00:48:59,898
Actually, I'm relieved.

721
00:49:00,107 --> 00:49:04,069
I think Wayne was trying
to set us up on a date.

722
00:49:04,278 --> 00:49:07,823
Oh, yeah.
He's got some crazy ideas.

723
00:49:08,031 --> 00:49:12,286
Yeah. Well, now that I know
that you're unavailable...

724
00:49:12,494 --> 00:49:13,829
...it makes this easier.

725
00:49:14,037 --> 00:49:15,539
We can just be friends.

726
00:49:15,789 --> 00:49:17,207
Exactly. Friends.

727
00:49:17,875 --> 00:49:19,084
Please.

728
00:49:19,668 --> 00:49:21,545
-Thank you.
-Sure.

729
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,423
So how are your parents?

730
00:49:24,631 --> 00:49:27,759
Oh, great. They're making
a fortune on the lnternet.

731
00:49:27,968 --> 00:49:30,721
They started their own Web site,
circusfreak.com.

732
00:49:31,513 --> 00:49:32,890
Wow, good for them.

733
00:49:33,223 --> 00:49:35,267
And how's your brother, Dog-face Boy?

734
00:49:35,475 --> 00:49:36,852
He got rabies.

735
00:49:37,269 --> 00:49:39,271
-God, that's too bad.
-Yeah.

736
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:42,399
We thought we were gonna
have to put him down...

737
00:49:42,608 --> 00:49:44,151
...but he recovered.

738
00:49:44,359 --> 00:49:46,153
Oh, good. Good.

739
00:49:46,361 --> 00:49:47,779
So how are you?

740
00:49:47,988 --> 00:49:50,282
Oh, me? I'm great.

741
00:49:50,532 --> 00:49:53,952
Yeah, everything's been
really good, you know?

742
00:49:54,119 --> 00:49:55,454
Yeah.

743
00:49:56,914 --> 00:49:58,790
Well, my fiancée died.

744
00:49:59,041 --> 00:50:00,083
She died?

745
00:50:00,292 --> 00:50:01,251
Yeah, she's dead.

746
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:03,420
-I am so sorry.
-Oh, don't be.

747
00:50:03,629 --> 00:50:05,881
Please don't be sorry.

748
00:50:06,381 --> 00:50:08,133
It's nothing.

749
00:50:09,426 --> 00:50:12,137
So how do you feel about....

750
00:50:17,017 --> 00:50:18,393
Oh, no.

751
00:50:18,602 --> 00:50:23,190
Oh, gosh. Just cry. Let it out.

752
00:50:23,398 --> 00:50:26,610
I'm here for you, okay?
I'm here for you.

753
00:50:26,819 --> 00:50:28,070
Thank you.

754
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:42,125
Wait a minute. Wait.
You're a Neil Diamond fan too?

755
00:50:42,334 --> 00:50:44,920
Oh! The man's a genius.

756
00:50:45,128 --> 00:50:46,505
Yeah!

757
00:50:46,672 --> 00:50:50,384
He's the greatest songwriter-performer
of this or any generation.

758
00:50:50,592 --> 00:50:51,593
I know.

759
00:51:04,481 --> 00:51:06,108
Oh, God.

760
00:51:13,365 --> 00:51:15,033
I brought you some more videos.

761
00:51:15,242 --> 00:51:17,703
You got your choice:
Porno or monster trucks.

762
00:51:17,870 --> 00:51:19,913
-And I got one that's both.
-Thanks, J.D.

763
00:51:20,122 --> 00:51:22,875
I really appreciate you
taking care of me.

764
00:51:23,417 --> 00:51:24,418
My pleasure.

765
00:51:24,626 --> 00:51:28,088
Hey, you strike me as
a pretty responsible guy.

766
00:51:28,297 --> 00:51:29,298
Thanks.

767
00:51:29,506 --> 00:51:33,010
That's why I'm surprised
that you let Wayne boss you around.

768
00:51:34,928 --> 00:51:35,971
Wayne's not--

769
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:39,641
No one bosses me around.
Wayne's not the boss of me.

770
00:51:40,017 --> 00:51:44,021
Yeah. I think that you
seem depressed and confused.

771
00:51:44,229 --> 00:51:45,606
You think?

772
00:51:45,814 --> 00:51:48,400
You have a self-defeating
personality disorder.

773
00:51:50,569 --> 00:51:52,321
Have you considered therapy?

774
00:51:54,448 --> 00:51:58,202
I remember in high school, you were
really into helping people.

775
00:51:58,410 --> 00:52:01,205
At parties, you were always
the designated driver.

776
00:52:01,413 --> 00:52:04,333
Right. And I remember you
were a really good dancer.

777
00:52:04,541 --> 00:52:08,420
And strong too. You used to be
able to lift me up over your head.

778
00:52:08,629 --> 00:52:10,047
Still can.

779
00:52:10,297 --> 00:52:11,590
Oh, really?

780
00:52:12,466 --> 00:52:14,593
Ready? And....

781
00:52:19,014 --> 00:52:20,516
-Oh, Darren!
-Help me!

782
00:52:20,724 --> 00:52:22,351
Are you okay?

783
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:23,769
-I can't--
-Just hang on.

784
00:52:25,896 --> 00:52:27,105
I can't swim.

785
00:52:43,705 --> 00:52:44,873
Darren!

786
00:52:45,833 --> 00:52:47,417
Are you okay?

787
00:52:47,668 --> 00:52:50,754
Thank you. Thank you for saving me.

788
00:52:52,506 --> 00:52:54,091
No problem.

789
00:53:03,225 --> 00:53:06,979
Let it out now. There you go.

790
00:53:09,189 --> 00:53:10,149
Come on.

791
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:11,733
Let's go, okay?

792
00:53:15,571 --> 00:53:18,323
You're a lot stronger
than you were in high school.

793
00:53:18,490 --> 00:53:21,910
Yeah, well, the convent's
got a great gym.

794
00:53:25,330 --> 00:53:28,208
And ever since then,
I've been afraid of toilets.

795
00:53:28,417 --> 00:53:30,711
What else can I say
about second grade?

796
00:53:30,919 --> 00:53:32,588
J.D., let's fast-forward.

797
00:53:32,796 --> 00:53:35,674
-Have you ever had a girlfriend?
-Yes.

798
00:53:35,841 --> 00:53:36,842
No.

799
00:53:37,092 --> 00:53:40,179
Have you ever fantasized
about having sex with a man?

800
00:53:40,387 --> 00:53:41,847
-Which man?
-Any man.

801
00:53:42,055 --> 00:53:44,349
-You mean, like, a tall man?
-Sure, whatever.

802
00:53:44,558 --> 00:53:47,352
-I don't like tall people.
-How about a short man?

803
00:53:47,603 --> 00:53:52,024
How short? Sometimes people can be
too short. That's weird, like midgets.

804
00:53:52,357 --> 00:53:56,069
Have you fantasized about having
sex with any man? Any man at all?

805
00:53:56,278 --> 00:53:58,614
Does that include celebrities?

806
00:54:00,949 --> 00:54:02,993
-Can I ask you something?
-Sure.

807
00:54:03,202 --> 00:54:07,206
I mean, not that it matters now...

808
00:54:07,831 --> 00:54:12,628
...but if I had asked you out back
in high school, would you have gone?

809
00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:15,088
Definitely.

810
00:54:16,465 --> 00:54:19,510
-Not that it matters now, you know.
-Right.

811
00:54:24,556 --> 00:54:26,475
-Perfect.
-Thanks.

812
00:54:27,434 --> 00:54:29,812
Could you, you know, turn around?

813
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:31,522
Right. Yeah, certainly.

814
00:54:40,322 --> 00:54:41,990
I have these.

815
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:45,702
Sorry, sorry, those are....

816
00:54:46,286 --> 00:54:47,246
Thanks.

817
00:55:00,050 --> 00:55:02,469
-Can you zip me up?
-Yeah.

818
00:55:05,514 --> 00:55:07,349
I had a really good time.

819
00:55:07,558 --> 00:55:08,809
Me too.

820
00:55:09,017 --> 00:55:11,520
-Do you want to have dinner tonight?
-I can't.

821
00:55:11,728 --> 00:55:14,481
Tomorrow I have a test in my
catechism class...

822
00:55:14,690 --> 00:55:19,486
...and I have to score at least an 85
so I can take my vows on Sunday.

823
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:21,071
What about tomorrow?

824
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:25,617
I'm scheduled to take care
of an elderly nun on her death bed.

825
00:55:25,993 --> 00:55:27,327
I understand.

826
00:55:27,536 --> 00:55:29,872
But I'd really like to see you again.

827
00:55:30,998 --> 00:55:32,583
I'll get out of it.

828
00:55:33,083 --> 00:55:33,125
I always knew I was different,
and now I know why.

829
00:55:33,125 --> 00:55:36,378
I always knew I was different,
and now I know why.

830
00:55:36,587 --> 00:55:38,589
I'm gay.

831
00:55:39,506 --> 00:55:43,677
You're the only person
who's ever truly understood me.

832
00:55:43,886 --> 00:55:46,680
It's okay. Just let it out.

833
00:55:46,889 --> 00:55:48,724
Everything will be all right.

834
00:55:48,932 --> 00:55:51,476
It's all gonna be okay.

835
00:55:51,685 --> 00:55:53,353
It's gonna be just--

836
00:56:31,808 --> 00:56:33,811
Judith escaped.

837
00:56:34,853 --> 00:56:35,854
Der!

838
00:56:40,734 --> 00:56:44,780
Get to the truck. Go. Go. Go. Go.

839
00:56:58,043 --> 00:57:00,504
Okay, she can't be far.

840
00:57:02,256 --> 00:57:03,215
I see her!

841
00:57:03,423 --> 00:57:05,050
Where? Okay, steady, steady!

842
00:57:07,886 --> 00:57:08,971
I missed her.

843
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:16,395
Now. Let's go. Go, go!

844
00:57:16,603 --> 00:57:18,856
You go this way,
I'll go that way! Go!

845
00:57:27,990 --> 00:57:30,576
Open up! I've been kidnapped!

846
00:57:32,911 --> 00:57:34,288
Hold your goddamn horses!

847
00:57:34,746 --> 00:57:36,081
Oh, thank God. Hurry up.

848
00:57:40,836 --> 00:57:43,255
Tonight Mr. Chang gets lucky.

849
00:57:45,465 --> 00:57:47,593
Young lady, so horny, so impatient.

850
00:57:52,431 --> 00:57:54,766
Oh, scrotum!

851
00:57:56,685 --> 00:57:59,354
Dude, she's stealing the truck!
Come on!

852
00:58:03,275 --> 00:58:05,736
-Now! I got her.
-Do her! Come on!

853
00:58:06,069 --> 00:58:07,613
I got her.

854
00:58:17,122 --> 00:58:19,124
Okay, Judith, it's over.

855
00:58:19,374 --> 00:58:23,045
You might as well turn around
and head back to the house.

856
00:58:35,641 --> 00:58:36,642
Oh, thank God.

857
00:58:59,790 --> 00:59:02,709
Hi, officers. You're safe.

858
00:59:03,085 --> 00:59:04,878
I'm Cowboy Wayne.

859
00:59:05,379 --> 00:59:08,549
I just bagged me
one of them killer goats...

860
00:59:08,757 --> 00:59:11,426
...that escaped from the zoo.

861
00:59:12,344 --> 00:59:14,012
-Good job.
-Yeah.

862
00:59:14,263 --> 00:59:16,932
Okay, then, I'll see you later.

863
00:59:30,028 --> 00:59:32,406
There. That should
hold you for tonight.

864
00:59:33,615 --> 00:59:34,867
Don't!

865
00:59:40,038 --> 00:59:41,874
What the hell happened?

866
00:59:42,916 --> 00:59:44,877
Judith was giving me some therapy...

867
00:59:45,043 --> 00:59:47,546
...and helped me realize
I was gay and--

868
00:59:47,796 --> 00:59:49,339
Wait. What?

869
00:59:50,299 --> 00:59:51,633
I see what happened.

870
00:59:52,676 --> 00:59:54,386
She messed with your head.

871
00:59:54,636 --> 00:59:56,263
Wayne, I'm gay.

872
00:59:56,471 --> 00:59:59,933
No, you're not.
You're just unsuccessful with women.

873
01:00:00,142 --> 01:00:04,396
No, I'm gay. Judith got me
in touch with the inner J.D.

874
01:00:04,563 --> 01:00:05,689
How'd she do that?

875
01:00:05,939 --> 01:00:07,399
She listened.

876
01:00:07,816 --> 01:00:12,779
Unlike people who knew me for years
and ignored all the telltale signs.

877
01:00:12,946 --> 01:00:15,699
-Like what?
-Like my obsession with Bette Midler.

878
01:00:15,949 --> 01:00:17,743
My preference for track lighting.

879
01:00:17,951 --> 01:00:20,746
And the fact that I like sucking dick.

880
01:00:20,954 --> 01:00:23,332
What?! You've done that?!

881
01:00:24,041 --> 01:00:27,961
Not with another guy, but remember
when I bought that book on yoga?

882
01:00:28,170 --> 01:00:29,880
I don't want to hear anymore.

883
01:00:30,088 --> 01:00:33,509
Look, you want to be gay?
Fine! No problem!

884
01:00:33,717 --> 01:00:36,512
But from now on,
I'll take care of Judith myself.

885
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:37,930
Okay!

886
01:00:42,601 --> 01:00:45,020
-You want to be gay with me?
-No!

887
01:00:50,150 --> 01:00:51,819
Come on, go, come on.

888
01:00:52,027 --> 01:00:54,655
All you, all you! Eleven. Okay.

889
01:00:54,863 --> 01:00:57,950
One more. One more.
Come on. One more.

890
01:00:58,951 --> 01:01:00,869
Feel the burn. Come on, now.

891
01:01:03,121 --> 01:01:04,331
Eleven.

892
01:01:05,290 --> 01:01:06,542
What's the matter, dear?

893
01:01:07,167 --> 01:01:11,004
You never used to be so winded
after only five sets.

894
01:01:11,213 --> 01:01:13,549
Well, Mother Superior...

895
01:01:14,383 --> 01:01:19,096
...I'm having some second thoughts
about becoming a nun.

896
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:21,098
Oh, don't get me wrong.

897
01:01:21,306 --> 01:01:24,518
This is a terrific convent. But I--

898
01:01:24,726 --> 01:01:25,978
But....

899
01:01:26,228 --> 01:01:27,229
Well...

900
01:01:28,397 --> 01:01:31,775
...I'm having these feelings.

901
01:01:31,984 --> 01:01:33,402
What kind of feelings?

902
01:01:37,364 --> 01:01:39,366
You mean sexual feelings.

903
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:43,453
Yeah, but it's so much more than that.

904
01:01:43,662 --> 01:01:44,663
Yes, well...

905
01:01:45,164 --> 01:01:46,582
...my dear...

906
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:51,461
...you're the only one who can decide
if this is the life you want to live.

907
01:01:51,670 --> 01:01:54,089
But once you take your final vows...

908
01:01:55,382 --> 01:01:57,634
...there is no going back.

909
01:01:58,510 --> 01:02:01,972
Now, let's go bust out
some power squats.

910
01:02:16,195 --> 01:02:21,033
There. That should keep you
from escaping again. And this....

911
01:02:23,202 --> 01:02:24,369
This....

912
01:02:24,912 --> 01:02:26,872
This should keep you from biting.

913
01:02:27,748 --> 01:02:30,459
-How am I gonna eat?
-I thought of that.

914
01:02:31,710 --> 01:02:33,295
-What is that?
-It's breakfast.

915
01:02:33,545 --> 01:02:36,590
It's pancakes, sausage,
hash brown, Pop Tart, puréed.

916
01:02:36,798 --> 01:02:38,967
I won't eat it. I want a Big Montana.

917
01:02:39,176 --> 01:02:41,512
A Big Montana from Arby's
with curly fries.

918
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:46,016
I won't get you one. If you won't eat
what I made for you, you can starve!

919
01:02:46,725 --> 01:02:48,519
Why are you doing this?!

920
01:02:48,769 --> 01:02:50,604
To save our friendship.

921
01:02:50,813 --> 01:02:53,774
Friendship? It seems like
you're in love with Darren.

922
01:02:54,149 --> 01:02:55,442
Bullshit!

923
01:02:55,651 --> 01:02:58,862
Just get over it.
Your buddy smokes pole and so do you.

924
01:02:59,863 --> 01:03:01,532
I am so un-gay!

925
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:05,536
Let's pretend you're straight.
When's the last time you got any?

926
01:03:05,744 --> 01:03:07,079
None of your business.

927
01:03:07,621 --> 01:03:08,705
So it's been years?

928
01:03:09,414 --> 01:03:12,626
-I'm waiting for the right woman.
-There is no right woman.

929
01:03:12,835 --> 01:03:17,297
If there was, you've already met
and she's killed herself or become gay.

930
01:03:17,756 --> 01:03:19,550
-Bite me!
-Blow me!

931
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:21,051
-Skank!
-Eunuch!

932
01:03:21,552 --> 01:03:24,721
Stealer of my friend!

933
01:03:32,437 --> 01:03:34,398
What happened to your head?

934
01:03:38,026 --> 01:03:39,653
I saw Judith.

935
01:03:40,154 --> 01:03:41,613
Judith's dead.

936
01:03:41,822 --> 01:03:43,157
Yeah, but...

937
01:03:43,407 --> 01:03:45,492
...I could've sworn it was her.

938
01:03:45,701 --> 01:03:48,245
-I was on--
-You poor thing.

939
01:03:48,453 --> 01:03:50,247
You're still not over her death.

940
01:03:50,706 --> 01:03:53,292
Maybe we shouldn't be
seeing each other.

941
01:03:54,001 --> 01:03:57,629
No. No. God, I'm fine.

942
01:03:57,838 --> 01:04:00,507
And, look, I can deal
with this. Okay?

943
01:04:04,678 --> 01:04:07,389
-So, what are you having?
-Let's see.

944
01:04:07,598 --> 01:04:10,726
There's the duck.
That was always Judith's favorite.

945
01:04:10,934 --> 01:04:12,478
-I'm sorry.
-I should leave.

946
01:04:12,686 --> 01:04:14,771
No, you shouldn't. I'm so sorry.

947
01:04:14,980 --> 01:04:18,275
I will never mention
Judith's name again, really.

948
01:04:18,484 --> 01:04:20,277
I swear. I swear.

949
01:04:23,197 --> 01:04:25,199
Would you excuse me for a moment?

950
01:04:25,741 --> 01:04:29,036
Please. I'll be right back. Okay?

951
01:04:29,244 --> 01:04:31,163
In a-- In a moment.

952
01:04:37,503 --> 01:04:38,879
Damn it!

953
01:04:42,883 --> 01:04:45,385
-What do you want?!
-Wayne, it's me, Darren.

954
01:04:45,802 --> 01:04:50,015
I have a problem. I'm with Sandy,
but I can't stop talking about Judith.

955
01:04:50,516 --> 01:04:52,810
Okay. I'll be right there.

956
01:05:05,072 --> 01:05:07,032
Okay, open up your shirt.

957
01:05:07,241 --> 01:05:08,951
-Why?
-Just do it.

958
01:05:10,077 --> 01:05:11,787
What is this?

959
01:05:13,914 --> 01:05:14,915
Now...

960
01:05:15,582 --> 01:05:17,417
...here's what's gonna happen.

961
01:05:19,378 --> 01:05:22,506
I'm going to listen
to your conversation.

962
01:05:23,340 --> 01:05:24,424
Now...

963
01:05:25,425 --> 01:05:28,595
...if you say anything about Judith...

964
01:05:29,096 --> 01:05:31,682
...or so much as mention her name...

965
01:05:31,890 --> 01:05:34,518
...then I'll give you a little shock.

966
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:37,771
Perfect.

967
01:05:39,523 --> 01:05:43,068
I don't think I'm comfortable
having these things on my nipples.

968
01:05:43,277 --> 01:05:44,945
I could put them on your balls.

969
01:05:45,279 --> 01:05:47,614
The nipples are fine. Nipples work.

970
01:05:50,284 --> 01:05:54,079
Hi. Sorry, sorry, sorry.
I'm back. I am back.

971
01:05:54,288 --> 01:05:57,791
There was a talkative
men's room attendant.

972
01:05:58,125 --> 01:05:59,126
That's okay.

973
01:06:13,223 --> 01:06:14,766
-Excuse me.
-Hey.

974
01:06:14,975 --> 01:06:17,060
-This table's reserved.
-You know what?

975
01:06:17,269 --> 01:06:20,063
I come here all the time,
and spend a lot of money...

976
01:06:20,272 --> 01:06:22,441
...so why not leave me the hell alone?

977
01:06:25,152 --> 01:06:27,237
I don't mean to be pushy...

978
01:06:27,446 --> 01:06:30,157
...but if this relationship
is gonna get serious...

979
01:06:30,365 --> 01:06:32,284
...I have to give up becoming a nun...

980
01:06:32,659 --> 01:06:34,828
...and I'd have to decide soon...

981
01:06:35,496 --> 01:06:37,664
...because my final vows
are on Sunday.

982
01:06:38,248 --> 01:06:40,459
Yeah, that thought had occurred to me.

983
01:06:40,667 --> 01:06:42,169
And if I do that...

984
01:06:42,377 --> 01:06:46,507
...I need to know that
you want marriage and a family.

985
01:06:47,674 --> 01:06:48,675
Absolutely.

986
01:06:50,844 --> 01:06:54,681
I never thought I'd say this to anyone
after Luigi died, but...

987
01:06:55,724 --> 01:06:57,267
...I love you, Darren.

988
01:07:01,063 --> 01:07:02,481
I love you too, Judith.

989
01:07:05,359 --> 01:07:07,653
-Judith?!
-I mean Sandy.

990
01:07:07,820 --> 01:07:11,573
I mean, let's dance. Okay?

991
01:07:20,290 --> 01:07:21,375
You're out of here.

992
01:07:21,583 --> 01:07:24,127
Put me down! I haven't ordered yet!

993
01:07:27,548 --> 01:07:30,092
Time for an attitude
adjustment, mister.

994
01:07:33,387 --> 01:07:35,222
Hey, nice move.

995
01:07:43,230 --> 01:07:44,314
Damn, he's good.

996
01:07:46,191 --> 01:07:47,359
Darren!

997
01:07:52,489 --> 01:07:53,448
Oh, my God!

998
01:07:53,824 --> 01:07:56,076
Oh, jeez. Oh, my God!

999
01:07:59,121 --> 01:08:01,165
Are you okay?

1000
01:08:02,749 --> 01:08:04,209
It was a little weird.

1001
01:08:17,306 --> 01:08:19,057
-What's going on?
-I can explain.

1002
01:08:19,433 --> 01:08:24,062
It's aversion therapy. Wayne was
trying to help me get over Judith...

1003
01:08:24,271 --> 01:08:26,482
...so I had these things-- Nipples--

1004
01:08:26,690 --> 01:08:30,068
Oh, my God.
It's so much worse than I thought.

1005
01:08:30,277 --> 01:08:33,780
No, you're obviously not ready
for this relationship.

1006
01:08:34,948 --> 01:08:36,867
No, I am! Sandy, wait!

1007
01:08:38,118 --> 01:08:39,286
Okay.

1008
01:08:39,495 --> 01:08:40,537
Damn it!

1009
01:08:43,624 --> 01:08:45,125
Wait, wait.

1010
01:08:46,919 --> 01:08:48,629
Wait, Sandy!

1011
01:09:01,809 --> 01:09:03,519
Oh, my God!

1012
01:09:03,727 --> 01:09:05,771
Darren. What happened to you?

1013
01:09:05,979 --> 01:09:08,482
-I ran here from the club.
-That's 30 miles!

1014
01:09:08,690 --> 01:09:11,401
Yeah, I know. I wanted to say...

1015
01:09:11,985 --> 01:09:15,113
...I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Can you ever forgive me?

1016
01:09:15,989 --> 01:09:18,951
Because the whole Judith thing
and the nipple clamps...

1017
01:09:19,159 --> 01:09:20,285
-...it's crazy, and--
-Yes!

1018
01:09:21,870 --> 01:09:23,121
-Really?
-Yes.

1019
01:09:23,497 --> 01:09:24,665
Just like that?

1020
01:09:24,873 --> 01:09:27,668
Well, I am training
to become a nun, you know.

1021
01:09:27,876 --> 01:09:29,920
Forgiveness is just sort of my thing.

1022
01:09:30,170 --> 01:09:31,296
I love you.

1023
01:09:31,505 --> 01:09:32,548
-Really?
-I love you.

1024
01:09:32,756 --> 01:09:35,259
-I love you.
-Oh, love. Love.

1025
01:09:53,110 --> 01:09:55,696
-Happy?
-You didn't have to do that.

1026
01:09:55,904 --> 01:10:00,367
I just happened to be by Arby's.
They were throwing out old food...

1027
01:10:00,576 --> 01:10:03,078
...so, you know, I thought, "Why not?"

1028
01:10:03,287 --> 01:10:06,165
Either way, that's nice of you.

1029
01:10:13,380 --> 01:10:15,007
I was wondering:

1030
01:10:16,550 --> 01:10:18,886
-Why Darren?
-What do you mean?

1031
01:10:19,344 --> 01:10:22,806
You don't seem the type to go
for a sensitive guy like Darren.

1032
01:10:23,015 --> 01:10:27,644
You seem more the kind of woman
that needs an assertive type of guy.

1033
01:10:33,859 --> 01:10:36,195
Before I met Darren, I was--

1034
01:10:38,739 --> 01:10:40,824
I was engaged to a guy like that.

1035
01:10:41,533 --> 01:10:45,662
His idea of fun was to fly to Thailand
to fight in a kickboxing tournament.

1036
01:10:46,413 --> 01:10:47,831
U.S.A.! Go, Josh!

1037
01:11:11,396 --> 01:11:13,774
After that,
I decided no more tough guys.

1038
01:11:14,691 --> 01:11:16,652
Yeah, and then you found Darren.

1039
01:11:16,860 --> 01:11:17,903
Yeah.

1040
01:11:18,362 --> 01:11:21,949
-So do you even love him?
-There's different types of love.

1041
01:11:22,866 --> 01:11:24,409
I knew it!

1042
01:11:24,618 --> 01:11:28,664
Sometimes you make rational decisions.
You can't always follow your heart.

1043
01:11:28,997 --> 01:11:30,123
Yeah, whatever.

1044
01:11:30,499 --> 01:11:34,211
I will admit there's something sexy
about a man who takes charge.

1045
01:11:34,753 --> 01:11:36,713
Like you kidnapping me.

1046
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:39,591
That took balls.

1047
01:11:40,217 --> 01:11:41,760
Big balls.

1048
01:11:42,970 --> 01:11:44,930
I gotta say it turned me on.

1049
01:11:46,598 --> 01:11:47,933
It did?

1050
01:12:27,389 --> 01:12:28,807
Oh, my God.

1051
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:36,482
Goddamn these chains!

1052
01:12:41,153 --> 01:12:42,488
Little key, little key.

1053
01:12:43,238 --> 01:12:45,365
What am I doing? I can't let you go!

1054
01:12:45,741 --> 01:12:48,285
Just give me one free hand.
It'll be worth it.

1055
01:12:49,870 --> 01:12:52,122
Okay. Give me the fries.

1056
01:13:01,590 --> 01:13:03,258
-Hi.
-Wow.

1057
01:13:03,467 --> 01:13:04,676
Hey.

1058
01:13:05,219 --> 01:13:06,470
Shit.

1059
01:13:09,473 --> 01:13:11,600
Just wait one minute, okay?

1060
01:13:15,896 --> 01:13:17,731
-Dude--
-Dude, you got a boner?

1061
01:13:18,023 --> 01:13:19,024
No.

1062
01:13:19,233 --> 01:13:21,318
-Why didn't you answer the door?
-I'm eating.

1063
01:13:21,527 --> 01:13:22,986
-So?
-I don't answer when I'm eating.

1064
01:13:23,195 --> 01:13:24,488
-Since when?
-Since always.

1065
01:13:24,696 --> 01:13:27,699
-I never knew that.
-You didn't know a lot, like I'm gay.

1066
01:13:28,033 --> 01:13:31,328
-Anything else you want to tell me?
-I got three balls.

1067
01:13:31,537 --> 01:13:34,373
Shut up! God!

1068
01:13:35,916 --> 01:13:36,959
Dude.

1069
01:13:38,210 --> 01:13:39,211
Hi, coach.

1070
01:13:39,419 --> 01:13:40,879
What are you doing here?

1071
01:13:41,088 --> 01:13:43,549
Retrial. Got a judge
that's a sports fan.

1072
01:13:44,007 --> 01:13:46,009
-Congrats.
-What will you do now?

1073
01:13:46,218 --> 01:13:50,264
That's why I'm here. Need a place
to crash, figure out my next move.

1074
01:13:50,472 --> 01:13:52,141
I knew I could count on you.

1075
01:13:52,349 --> 01:13:55,519
-Well, we gotta talk about--
-You stay as long as you like.

1076
01:13:55,811 --> 01:13:58,689
Great! Where's the bathroom?
I gotta take a dump.

1077
01:13:58,897 --> 01:14:02,943
We don't use the toilet anymore since
we're cutting down on the water bill.

1078
01:14:03,152 --> 01:14:04,278
What do you do?

1079
01:14:04,486 --> 01:14:07,114
Well, we just use the lawn now.

1080
01:14:07,531 --> 01:14:09,199
Smart thinking.

1081
01:14:09,575 --> 01:14:10,576
Oh, God!

1082
01:14:10,951 --> 01:14:13,954
You pinch loaves on the lawn?
I play croquet out there.

1083
01:14:14,163 --> 01:14:16,498
Are you crazy? Coach can't stay here!

1084
01:14:16,707 --> 01:14:19,793
-We got a woman locked in the garage!
-Oh, yeah!

1085
01:14:24,756 --> 01:14:26,425
You boys got any T.P.?

1086
01:14:26,633 --> 01:14:27,968
No!

1087
01:14:28,260 --> 01:14:30,304
That's all right.
I'll find something.

1088
01:14:36,143 --> 01:14:39,104
Play it cool. We'll find
some way to get rid of him.

1089
01:14:39,313 --> 01:14:43,400
We tell him we got dates. He can't
be here because we're getting laid.

1090
01:14:43,609 --> 01:14:45,736
No, he'll never believe that.

1091
01:14:45,944 --> 01:14:47,779
We'll tell him we got ghosts.

1092
01:14:47,988 --> 01:14:50,115
So, boys, what's for supper?

1093
01:14:50,324 --> 01:14:52,826
-Listen, coach--
-We have ghosts.

1094
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:57,164
We were thinking that maybe you
staying here's not such a great idea.

1095
01:14:57,372 --> 01:15:01,460
Nonsense. It'll give us a chance
to get to know one another again.

1096
01:15:01,668 --> 01:15:06,298
So you boys take care of that bitch
that was gonna marry Silverman?

1097
01:15:06,507 --> 01:15:10,177
Yeah, we snuffed that bitch
just like you said.

1098
01:15:10,677 --> 01:15:12,596
Good. How'd you do it?

1099
01:15:13,472 --> 01:15:14,473
-We--
-Ate her.

1100
01:15:15,098 --> 01:15:16,099
You ate her?

1101
01:15:16,350 --> 01:15:19,228
-Yeah. We ate her.
-Alive.

1102
01:15:19,436 --> 01:15:20,771
My hat goes off to you.

1103
01:15:20,979 --> 01:15:23,857
You boys are smart.
That's the perfect crime.

1104
01:15:24,942 --> 01:15:27,069
Wonder what's on the tube.

1105
01:15:27,361 --> 01:15:28,612
-No! Coach!
-No!

1106
01:15:29,863 --> 01:15:33,450
What the hell we got here?
Some kind of public access show?

1107
01:15:34,451 --> 01:15:36,578
That's the kidnap victim, ain't it?

1108
01:15:36,787 --> 01:15:37,955
You didn't kill her!

1109
01:15:38,163 --> 01:15:39,790
No. Coach, listen....

1110
01:15:39,998 --> 01:15:43,043
I am really disappointed in you boys.

1111
01:15:43,252 --> 01:15:45,879
I want you to go out there
and off that cooze.

1112
01:15:46,088 --> 01:15:47,464
We can't, coach.

1113
01:15:47,673 --> 01:15:50,300
Oh, for Pete's sakes!
Look! She's getting out!

1114
01:15:50,843 --> 01:15:53,262
Go chop her head off or something.

1115
01:15:54,304 --> 01:15:58,809
There's no fight left in you boys.
You're nutless. You been pussified.

1116
01:15:59,309 --> 01:16:02,980
Don't worry about a thing, boys.
I'll take care of that broad.

1117
01:16:09,486 --> 01:16:11,113
-Don't worry!
-Who are you?

1118
01:16:11,363 --> 01:16:14,783
Let's say I'm a friend of the boys,
and I'm here to kill you.

1119
01:16:15,033 --> 01:16:17,786
You don't mind if I try
to defend myself, do you?

1120
01:16:17,995 --> 01:16:20,873
Of course not.
I love a good challenge.

1121
01:16:41,518 --> 01:16:42,853
Are you okay?

1122
01:16:49,651 --> 01:16:50,694
Dude--

1123
01:16:58,452 --> 01:16:59,453
Got it?

1124
01:17:03,582 --> 01:17:06,376
-I'm so happy.
-Oh, me too.

1125
01:17:09,296 --> 01:17:11,089
Does this couch fold out?

1126
01:17:22,309 --> 01:17:24,603
What the hell is going on here?

1127
01:17:26,146 --> 01:17:27,231
-Judith!
-Yes.

1128
01:17:27,439 --> 01:17:28,899
-You're alive.
-Yes.

1129
01:17:29,107 --> 01:17:31,610
-Judith?
-Who is this tramp?

1130
01:17:31,819 --> 01:17:33,070
I'm not a tramp.

1131
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:36,615
Actually, until yesterday,
I was training to become a nun.

1132
01:17:37,032 --> 01:17:39,743
I'm gone for a week,
and you're screwing a nun?

1133
01:17:39,952 --> 01:17:42,579
No, no. We're in love.

1134
01:17:43,121 --> 01:17:44,456
I thought you were dead.

1135
01:17:44,832 --> 01:17:48,126
Oh, really? Well, I'm not dead.
I was kidnapped, okay?

1136
01:17:48,335 --> 01:17:50,337
It was hell!
I was beaten, tortured...

1137
01:17:50,546 --> 01:17:53,590
...and treated like
a frigging farm animal!

1138
01:17:53,799 --> 01:17:55,092
And the entire time...

1139
01:17:55,300 --> 01:17:58,303
...the only thing that kept
me alive was the thought...

1140
01:17:58,804 --> 01:18:02,474
...that somewhere out there,
my sweet Darren still loved me...

1141
01:18:02,683 --> 01:18:05,144
...and that one day
we'd be together again.

1142
01:18:07,771 --> 01:18:09,064
It was so horrible.

1143
01:18:17,573 --> 01:18:21,660
-Where are we going?
-I don't know. We gotta find her.

1144
01:18:22,369 --> 01:18:24,204
-Okay, where to?
-Go left!

1145
01:18:24,413 --> 01:18:25,998
I'm going right!

1146
01:18:26,665 --> 01:18:28,959
They kept me in
a dark closet for days.

1147
01:18:29,209 --> 01:18:34,089
And they fed me, like,
crushed potato chips under the door.

1148
01:18:37,050 --> 01:18:40,471
Maybe I should go.

1149
01:18:40,679 --> 01:18:42,055
Oh, no.

1150
01:18:44,683 --> 01:18:46,602
Please. Please, don't.

1151
01:18:46,810 --> 01:18:48,770
Don't leave.

1152
01:18:48,979 --> 01:18:50,272
Well, but, I mean...

1153
01:18:50,481 --> 01:18:54,693
...Judith's alive,
and she is your fiancée.

1154
01:18:56,278 --> 01:18:59,656
I know. You're right.
You're right. But....

1155
01:19:00,032 --> 01:19:02,117
But you can't go because I....

1156
01:19:02,576 --> 01:19:05,454
-Because what? Why, Darren?
-Because I--

1157
01:19:05,996 --> 01:19:07,581
-See, you--
-Yeah?

1158
01:19:07,789 --> 01:19:09,249
-Well, we-- And--
-Yeah?

1159
01:19:09,416 --> 01:19:12,336
Sweetheart, we pledged
our love to one another.

1160
01:19:12,544 --> 01:19:15,172
Spare her the pain
of seeing us together.

1161
01:19:15,380 --> 01:19:16,548
You...

1162
01:19:16,798 --> 01:19:18,884
...run along back to the nunnery.

1163
01:19:24,223 --> 01:19:25,224
She's right.

1164
01:19:25,641 --> 01:19:26,975
I mean...

1165
01:19:27,309 --> 01:19:29,520
...I did pledge.

1166
01:19:31,688 --> 01:19:33,065
Okay.

1167
01:19:36,109 --> 01:19:37,194
Bye.

1168
01:19:40,113 --> 01:19:41,490
She's here! Hey, Darren.

1169
01:19:41,698 --> 01:19:44,910
Sandy, hi. Look, I can--
Darren. Sorry.

1170
01:19:45,118 --> 01:19:48,664
Darren, look. I understand
that you're really upset.

1171
01:19:48,872 --> 01:19:51,375
I probably look like
a really big asshole--

1172
01:19:51,583 --> 01:19:52,918
Dude!

1173
01:19:54,419 --> 01:19:58,882
Okay. I deserved that.
But now let me explain--

1174
01:20:03,929 --> 01:20:08,350
Okay, I guess I deserved that one too,
but now we're even, okay?

1175
01:20:12,938 --> 01:20:16,775
Stop! We only did it
because we love you.

1176
01:20:16,942 --> 01:20:18,819
Oh, right, because you love me.

1177
01:20:19,027 --> 01:20:22,114
Yeah, man. Come on.
Give me a hug. It's--

1178
01:20:35,502 --> 01:20:39,631
-Freeze!
-Get your hands up!

1179
01:20:49,475 --> 01:20:52,352
Don't think my presence here
means I forgive you.

1180
01:20:52,561 --> 01:20:55,397
I just wanted to tell
you guys in person.

1181
01:20:55,606 --> 01:20:58,108
Judith and I are
getting married tomorrow.

1182
01:20:58,317 --> 01:21:00,944
You don't want to marry Judith.
Admit it.

1183
01:21:01,278 --> 01:21:03,947
-Of course I do.
-Okay.

1184
01:21:04,406 --> 01:21:06,658
Then look into my eyes and say it.

1185
01:21:07,117 --> 01:21:09,077
I want to marry Judith.

1186
01:21:09,411 --> 01:21:12,956
Look into both our eyes
at the same time and say it.

1187
01:21:13,499 --> 01:21:15,042
I'm out of here.

1188
01:21:16,460 --> 01:21:19,796
Come on. We're sorry, okay?

1189
01:21:20,130 --> 01:21:22,049
What we did was wrong.

1190
01:21:25,719 --> 01:21:27,221
We gotta stop that wedding.

1191
01:21:27,429 --> 01:21:29,223
Dude, how?

1192
01:21:30,516 --> 01:21:35,103
Let's go, you maggots!
Kill! Kill! Kill!

1193
01:21:37,606 --> 01:21:41,109
Coach. Yeah, it's Wayne and J.D.
Look, we need your help.

1194
01:21:41,318 --> 01:21:44,530
I'd do anything for you boys.
Name it, you got it.

1195
01:21:44,738 --> 01:21:49,326
Well, we need you to post bail for us.
It's $10,000 apiece.

1196
01:21:49,535 --> 01:21:52,538
-No way!
-Come on, coach.

1197
01:21:52,746 --> 01:21:54,039
We need your help.

1198
01:21:54,289 --> 01:21:56,834
Jail life is real tough. They're--

1199
01:21:57,084 --> 01:21:59,628
They're sodomizing us in here.

1200
01:21:59,837 --> 01:22:02,172
What?! They're corn-holing you?

1201
01:22:02,381 --> 01:22:06,510
Oh, my God. That's horrible.
Don't worry. I'll get you out.

1202
01:22:07,678 --> 01:22:11,473
You got sodomized?
Who? I want to meet him.

1203
01:22:13,892 --> 01:22:14,893
What is that?

1204
01:22:15,060 --> 01:22:17,062
Sounds kind of like my truck.

1205
01:22:23,902 --> 01:22:25,237
Come on, boys. Let's go.

1206
01:22:26,572 --> 01:22:28,532
Get the lead out, boys! Hut, hut!

1207
01:22:29,491 --> 01:22:31,034
Come on, move it!

1208
01:22:31,827 --> 01:22:35,038
You're free. Now, where to, boys?

1209
01:22:35,330 --> 01:22:36,582
Go left.

1210
01:22:38,750 --> 01:22:40,085
Charge!

1211
01:22:42,713 --> 01:22:44,673
Sandy Perkus...

1212
01:22:45,007 --> 01:22:47,759
...do you vow to lead
a life of poverty...

1213
01:22:47,968 --> 01:22:49,845
...chastity, obedience...

1214
01:22:50,053 --> 01:22:51,722
...and silence?

1215
01:22:52,389 --> 01:22:53,849
Wait!

1216
01:22:55,017 --> 01:22:56,018
Sorry.

1217
01:22:57,853 --> 01:22:59,354
Look, you can't do this.

1218
01:22:59,605 --> 01:23:01,940
-You love Darren, right?
-Well, yeah.

1219
01:23:02,191 --> 01:23:04,359
-Well, Darren loves you.
-Really?

1220
01:23:04,610 --> 01:23:07,654
Darren's her boyfriend,
but he has this other girlfriend...

1221
01:23:07,863 --> 01:23:10,866
-...and he's getting--
-So, what are you gonna do?

1222
01:23:12,701 --> 01:23:14,453
Go, my child.

1223
01:23:15,037 --> 01:23:16,121
-Okay.
-Come on.

1224
01:23:16,371 --> 01:23:18,415
We've got a wedding to crash!

1225
01:23:18,624 --> 01:23:20,459
Go. Go. Go.

1226
01:23:20,709 --> 01:23:21,710
Bye, everybody!

1227
01:23:22,878 --> 01:23:25,088
Damn. Lost another one.

1228
01:23:25,297 --> 01:23:27,216
Son of a bitch.

1229
01:23:41,939 --> 01:23:43,941
I can't believe I'm doing this.

1230
01:23:44,149 --> 01:23:46,819
Oh, here. We got you some clothes.

1231
01:23:48,403 --> 01:23:50,364
Where did you get these?

1232
01:23:50,572 --> 01:23:51,615
J.D.'s sister.

1233
01:23:51,824 --> 01:23:54,409
-She's a stripper.
-And a hooker.

1234
01:24:12,010 --> 01:24:13,178
Go! Gotta go!

1235
01:24:18,183 --> 01:24:19,309
Oh, my gosh!

1236
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:21,019
Neil Diamond!

1237
01:24:21,270 --> 01:24:22,729
What the hell is going on?

1238
01:24:22,938 --> 01:24:24,189
Neil, let me explain.

1239
01:24:24,398 --> 01:24:28,569
You're the guys who send me all those
letters and tapes. Naked pictures.

1240
01:24:28,777 --> 01:24:32,322
What? We never sent you
any naked pictures.

1241
01:24:32,698 --> 01:24:33,907
-Dude.
-Sorry.

1242
01:24:34,116 --> 01:24:36,910
Mr. Diamond, you gotta
help us save our buddy.

1243
01:24:37,119 --> 01:24:38,745
He's marrying the wrong woman.

1244
01:24:38,954 --> 01:24:41,165
Sandy and Darren, they broke up.

1245
01:24:41,373 --> 01:24:43,625
Love on the rocks.
Ain't no big surprise.

1246
01:24:43,834 --> 01:24:47,212
-Help us get them back together.
-I don't know.

1247
01:24:47,421 --> 01:24:50,299
Turn on your heart light.
Judith brainwashed him.

1248
01:24:50,507 --> 01:24:53,218
For years, Darren loved me,
but I never knew it.

1249
01:24:53,427 --> 01:24:54,887
Hold it. Hold it!

1250
01:24:55,721 --> 01:24:58,182
-Hold on.
-And did I mention I was gay?

1251
01:24:58,390 --> 01:25:01,685
I've spent my life writing songs
about the power of love...

1252
01:25:01,894 --> 01:25:04,730
...but up until right now,
they've only been words.

1253
01:25:04,980 --> 01:25:08,901
This may be my chance to prove that
those words really mean something.

1254
01:25:09,109 --> 01:25:12,196
-You say that if Darren marries...
-Judith.

1255
01:25:12,404 --> 01:25:14,907
-...Judith, he'll be miserable.
-Right.

1256
01:25:15,115 --> 01:25:19,119
I believe in happy endings. If Neil
Diamond has anything to do with it...

1257
01:25:19,328 --> 01:25:21,121
...this love story will have one.

1258
01:25:21,330 --> 01:25:23,373
Come on! Yeah!

1259
01:25:23,749 --> 01:25:26,627
We got Neil Diamond onboard!
All right!

1260
01:25:26,835 --> 01:25:29,588
-Where we going?
-The park on America Avenue.

1261
01:25:30,589 --> 01:25:32,424
-5-0!
-What?

1262
01:25:32,591 --> 01:25:33,759
Cops. Caprice.

1263
01:25:34,009 --> 01:25:36,220
Five cars back. Goddamn heat.

1264
01:25:36,470 --> 01:25:39,348
One little prison break,
and they're all over you.

1265
01:25:40,349 --> 01:25:41,600
Whoa, coach.

1266
01:25:42,184 --> 01:25:44,436
No matter what happens,
don't look back.

1267
01:25:44,603 --> 01:25:47,523
Just get this sweet gal
to the man who loves her.

1268
01:25:47,731 --> 01:25:51,693
I'd rather be cut down in a hail
of gunfire than to go back to jail.

1269
01:25:52,110 --> 01:25:54,279
Nice meeting you, Mr. Diamond.

1270
01:26:02,704 --> 01:26:03,872
Coach, look out!

1271
01:26:07,125 --> 01:26:08,252
They're not cops!

1272
01:26:13,715 --> 01:26:16,135
Hey, we're coming to America.

1273
01:26:21,265 --> 01:26:25,477
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here
today to join Darren Silverman...

1274
01:26:25,644 --> 01:26:28,981
...and Judith Fessbeggler
in holy matrimony.

1275
01:26:29,314 --> 01:26:32,234
If anyone has any objections,
speak now.

1276
01:26:32,484 --> 01:26:33,569
I do.

1277
01:26:33,777 --> 01:26:35,779
-What?
-Neil?

1278
01:26:41,410 --> 01:26:42,744
-Neil!
-Neil.

1279
01:26:42,953 --> 01:26:45,330
Get to the part where we say, "I do."

1280
01:27:08,353 --> 01:27:09,354
Oh, my!

1281
01:27:10,189 --> 01:27:12,024
-Say, "I do."
-No.

1282
01:27:12,441 --> 01:27:14,109
Say, "I do."

1283
01:27:14,359 --> 01:27:16,195
I can't. Because I...

1284
01:27:19,531 --> 01:27:21,492
...I love Neil...

1285
01:27:21,700 --> 01:27:23,535
...and I love Sandy.

1286
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:26,788
You're in love with this slut?

1287
01:27:26,997 --> 01:27:29,124
I am not a slut.

1288
01:27:29,625 --> 01:27:31,960
Sandy is my one and only someone.

1289
01:27:45,557 --> 01:27:47,017
What about me?

1290
01:27:47,559 --> 01:27:50,145
Who's my someone?

1291
01:28:07,871 --> 01:28:09,748
You ruined my life!

1292
01:28:11,083 --> 01:28:12,543
But I saved Darren's!

1293
01:28:12,751 --> 01:28:15,921
Just because I lost Darren
doesn't mean I'm crazy enough...

1294
01:28:16,213 --> 01:28:17,589
...to hook up with you!

1295
01:28:23,387 --> 01:28:26,807
Why can't you just admit that
when you kissed me, you liked it?

1296
01:28:27,015 --> 01:28:30,102
You're right. I have a weakness
for incompetent morons.

1297
01:28:39,194 --> 01:28:40,779
Admit it!

1298
01:28:42,072 --> 01:28:45,367
I'm the strong-willed,
assertive man that you need...

1299
01:28:45,576 --> 01:28:49,538
...and you're the hard-core bitch
that I've always dreamed of.

1300
01:29:09,892 --> 01:29:10,893
What about you?

1301
01:29:11,727 --> 01:29:15,230
-When are you gonna get hitched?
-Actually, I'm not. I'm gay.

1302
01:29:16,398 --> 01:29:17,649
Me too.

1303
01:29:17,900 --> 01:29:19,109
Really?

1304
01:29:19,860 --> 01:29:22,654
By the power vested in me
by the state of Washington...

1305
01:29:22,863 --> 01:29:25,532
...I now pronounce you man and wife.

1306
01:29:25,741 --> 01:29:27,409
You may kiss the bride.

1307
01:29:30,245 --> 01:29:32,873
I now pronounce you man and wife.

1308
01:29:33,081 --> 01:29:35,000
You may kiss the bride.

1309
01:29:37,711 --> 01:29:41,215
I now pronounce you man and man.

1310
01:29:41,423 --> 01:29:43,342
You may kiss the man.

1311
01:30:05,447 --> 01:30:07,449
Come on, we need you for this one.

1312
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:07,067
Neil Diamond. Hot August night, 1972.

1313
00:01:07,276 --> 00:01:12,197
That concert rocked and rolled.
I know because I was there.

1314
00:01:17,703 --> 00:01:19,079
That's me.

1315
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:23,709
My water broke.

1316
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:27,963
Eversince then, I've had this
cosmic connection with Neil.

1317
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:30,007
But this story isn't about Neil.

1318
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:33,719
It's about me and my two pals,
Darren and J.D.

1319
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:36,889
Best friends since fifth grade.

1320
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:42,769
That's J.D. He's lactose intolerant.

1321
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:46,899
And he's not very bright.

1322
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:49,610
That's Darren Silverman.

1323
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:51,361
He's a romantic.

1324
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,990
But when it comes to women,
he's incredibly gullible.

1325
00:02:01,914 --> 00:02:04,082
That's me, Wayne.

1326
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,251
I'm loyal to my friends.

1327
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,880
-I'd beat you up if you weren't a girl.
-Me too.

1328
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:21,266
After that, I started working out.

1329
00:02:22,184 --> 00:02:24,978
We stayed best friends
throughout high school.

1330
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:27,731
I was the third-string quarterback.

1331
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:31,777
J.D. became the school mascot.

1332
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:36,073
Hey, what did you say
I didn't really motherfucking hearyou

1333
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:39,034
Yeah, yeah you
Yeah you, yeah you, yeah you

1334
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:43,330
And Darrenjoined
the cheerleading squad.

1335
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:48,794
Oh, that's Sandy.

1336
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:51,797
Yeah, Darren's always
had a thing for her.

1337
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:54,800
When you're up against a Warbird

1338
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,260
You're upside down!

1339
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:59,429
Oh, that's Coach Norton.

1340
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:03,058
He was a big influence in our lives.
He taught us many things.

1341
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:05,644
Two things you got to remember, boys.

1342
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:09,565
Number one: Stay away from women.

1343
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:12,651
All they want from you
is your man juice.

1344
00:03:12,985 --> 00:03:13,986
Now...

1345
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:19,366
...if you get any urges that you can't
suppress with hard liquor, use this.

1346
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,829
-Oh, number two....
-Sportsmanship.

1347
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,330
Sportsmanship.

1348
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:27,457
Sportsmanship.

1349
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:32,504
You fairy wimp fruit bag!

1350
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:34,214
You suck!

1351
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:39,845
Le Fessier! Get out there!

1352
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,681
I'm just gonna get my helmet.

1353
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:45,475
Hey, guys! Guys, I'm in!

1354
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:48,562
-See, he's going in!
-Oh, my God!

1355
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:52,649
Go, Wayne! Go, Wayne!

1356
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:55,986
Blue 48! Blue 48!

1357
00:03:56,195 --> 00:03:57,696
Go! Set!

1358
00:03:57,905 --> 00:03:58,989
Hike!

1359
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:10,000
But now we're all grown-up.

1360
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:22,262
J.D. is rapidly working his way
up the ladder at Subway.

1361
00:04:22,638 --> 00:04:24,932
Recently he was promoted...

1362
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:29,019
...to temporary second assistant manager
in charge of training.

1363
00:04:29,228 --> 00:04:31,813
Okay, McNugent,
let's see what you got.

1364
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:37,152
I've been working on them for 8 weeks.
I present the future of Subway.

1365
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:38,612
Bellston...

1366
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:41,865
...three sizes of bevy are small,
medium and what?

1367
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:46,537
-Big?
-Like we practiced. You can do this.

1368
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:48,038
L....

1369
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:55,087
Long!

1370
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,297
Okay, we'll come back to you.

1371
00:04:57,506 --> 00:05:00,259
This guy's my stinkiest student
by far.

1372
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:02,261
Trimball, let's see your sub.

1373
00:05:04,096 --> 00:05:06,682
No, no. Meat on the inside,
bread outside.

1374
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:10,060
Okay, take it away.

1375
00:05:10,269 --> 00:05:12,020
Take it away!

1376
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:16,275
Don't judge me on those two guys.
This next guy's my protégé.

1377
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:20,362
He's top of his class, and for his
thesis he made a party sub.

1378
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,448
Heston, where's the party sub?

1379
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,505
Darren is a social director
at a retirement home.

1380
00:05:38,714 --> 00:05:39,715
B-17.

1381
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:41,508
Bingo.

1382
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,385
Bingo.

1383
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:45,137
Abe...

1384
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:48,599
...pull your pants up
or no more Matlock.

1385
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,688
I started my own business.

1386
00:05:57,816 --> 00:05:59,526
What are we dealing with here?

1387
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:02,446
I don't know, but it sounds big.

1388
00:06:04,156 --> 00:06:05,908
Stay back. I'm going in.

1389
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:13,165
Careful, sonny.

1390
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:21,715
So you're causing
all this trouble, huh?

1391
00:06:21,924 --> 00:06:22,925
Come here.

1392
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:25,761
Hey there. Hello.

1393
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,683
Here's the ferocious beast, huh?

1394
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:35,270
Hey, where's your mommy?

1395
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:39,608
Get off! Get it off!

1396
00:06:52,955 --> 00:06:54,540
Is it dead?

1397
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:55,874
No.

1398
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,877
But she is in one deep coon coma.

1399
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:14,351
Stop it!

1400
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:19,439
But we all have one mystical thing
in common: Ourlove forNeil.

1401
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:22,401
That's ourband,
Diamonds in the Rough.

1402
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:19,625
Hey, I'm Darren.

1403
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:20,876
Sophie.

1404
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:23,670
Do you, maybe, want to grab
a drink with me?

1405
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:26,173
I'm sorry. I'm involved.

1406
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:28,133
With a real entertainer.

1407
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:41,647
I can't believe I got blown off again.
I'll never meet the right girl.

1408
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:44,399
You don't want
a chick who'd fuck a mime.

1409
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:48,070
Dude, what does a mime look like
when it's having sex anyway?

1410
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:49,738
It's probably like:

1411
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:54,493
"l'm a mime. I'm a mime."

1412
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,662
Hey, mimes don't talk.

1413
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:01,750
They do when they're off duty.

1414
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:06,088
It's not her. It's all women.

1415
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:10,092
I'm really afraid that
there's nobody out there for me.

1416
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,177
The only girl I ever loved...

1417
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:14,805
...walked out of my life years ago.

1418
00:09:15,264 --> 00:09:16,431
Sandy Perkus.

1419
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,100
-Rememberher?
-Smile.

1420
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:20,185
Her family was with the circus.

1421
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:21,979
Her dad was The Strong Man.

1422
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:24,022
Hermom was The Bearded Lady.

1423
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:26,275
Herbrother was The Dog-faced Boy.

1424
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:31,446
Before I mustered the courage
to ask her out, she moved away.

1425
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,950
You know, I truly believe...

1426
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:39,621
...that there is a one and only
someone for everyone.

1427
00:09:39,955 --> 00:09:41,331
And Sandy...

1428
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,458
...Sandy Perkus...

1429
00:09:45,127 --> 00:09:47,045
...was my one and only.

1430
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:50,340
Man, that is so romantic.

1431
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,843
Oh, my God!
Look at that juicy piece of ass.

1432
00:09:56,847 --> 00:09:58,390
What do you think of her?

1433
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:00,100
-Who?
-Right there.

1434
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,685
In the red?

1435
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,397
-Yeah, she's gorgeous.
-Go talk to her.

1436
00:10:05,606 --> 00:10:07,316
-No.
-Okay, I'll do it for you.

1437
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:09,026
What? Hey, wait.

1438
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:12,696
Hi. I'm Wayne.

1439
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:15,032
-No.
-No, you don't understand.

1440
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:16,783
I'm not hitting on you.

1441
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:18,035
Back off.

1442
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:21,246
I just want to tell you
about my buddy, Darren.

1443
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:23,165
He's smart, he's sensitive--

1444
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:25,501
-I don't care.
-He'd make a great husband.

1445
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:27,711
-I don't want to meet him.
-Great.

1446
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:34,301
Dude, she wants you.
She thinks you're really cute.

1447
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:36,094
-Really?
-Yeah, she's like:

1448
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:38,972
"Oh, I'm so excited to meet him,"
and everything.

1449
00:10:39,223 --> 00:10:40,682
-Are you sure?
-Totally!

1450
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:42,893
Get down there and make your move.

1451
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:45,521
I don't know.

1452
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:46,730
Come on!

1453
00:10:46,939 --> 00:10:49,274
-Carpe poon!
-Really?

1454
00:10:51,902 --> 00:10:54,780
-Okay, I'll do it.
-All right!

1455
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:04,206
I'm Darren.

1456
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:10,587
Darren. My friend said
you wanted to meet me.

1457
00:11:10,796 --> 00:11:11,964
He lied.

1458
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:14,508
That's a good one.

1459
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,803
No, seriously.
I don't want to meet you.

1460
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:28,188
My friend must have been mistaken.

1461
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:32,526
I'm really sorry to bother you.

1462
00:11:37,406 --> 00:11:38,866
Let me guess.

1463
00:11:39,575 --> 00:11:43,036
That jerk tried to get into your pants
with some tacky line.

1464
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:44,746
I'm not like that.

1465
00:11:44,997 --> 00:11:46,415
I use magic.

1466
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:48,333
Beat it, baldy.

1467
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,295
Okay, good stuff.
Tough crowd. I like that.

1468
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:53,463
I have here two...

1469
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:55,883
...ordinary metal rings.

1470
00:11:56,091 --> 00:11:58,010
You and me.

1471
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,639
I love you.

1472
00:12:03,891 --> 00:12:05,392
Sorry, I forgot my beer.

1473
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:09,479
This is my boyfriend, Darren.
So hit the bricks, porky.

1474
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:12,274
Okay. Nice to meet you, Darren.

1475
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:13,483
Satan.

1476
00:12:17,863 --> 00:12:20,365
I'm sorry about
hitting on you before--

1477
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:22,367
-You should be.
-I am. I am.

1478
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:25,454
I just, I wasn't thinking in....

1479
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:29,541
You're so beautiful, and I....

1480
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,461
I'm sorry.

1481
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:36,215
So make up for it. Buy me a drink.

1482
00:12:37,049 --> 00:12:39,218
-Yeah. Okay.
-I'll have a Scotch.

1483
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:42,262
Give the lady a Scotch,
and I'll have another beer.

1484
00:12:42,471 --> 00:12:45,557
-He'll have a gin and tonic.
-Make that a gin and tonic.

1485
00:12:49,061 --> 00:12:52,397
Can you believe he hooked up
with the queen of all hotties?

1486
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:55,359
They're just having a drink together.

1487
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:59,112
It's not like they're
going steady or anything.

1488
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:04,451
It's midnight.
You know what that means?

1489
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,620
No. What?

1490
00:13:06,829 --> 00:13:08,622
It's our six-week anniversary.

1491
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:13,085
-Did you get me anything?
-No.

1492
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:15,045
That's okay. That's okay.

1493
00:13:15,254 --> 00:13:16,713
No big deal. But...

1494
00:13:18,257 --> 00:13:19,675
...I...

1495
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:22,678
...got you a little something.

1496
00:13:24,346 --> 00:13:26,181
Thanks. That's really nice.

1497
00:13:32,104 --> 00:13:34,439
You know, I've been thinking.

1498
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:39,611
We've been together for a while now...

1499
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,155
...and it seems like
maybe it's time...

1500
00:13:43,824 --> 00:13:47,452
...we get a little more intimate.

1501
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:50,998
Are you saying you want to have sex?

1502
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,459
Yeah, I am.

1503
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:58,589
I don't believe in premarital sex.
I'd rather not cheapen what we have.

1504
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:02,092
Of course. Of course not.
Me neither.

1505
00:14:02,301 --> 00:14:04,261
-So it's best to wait.
-You're right.

1506
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:07,848
I think-- I mean, you're--
It's best.

1507
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:10,142
But...

1508
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:12,895
...that doesn't mean that we can't...

1509
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:15,939
...pleasure each other in other ways.

1510
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,614
I got you.

1511
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:25,365
Oh, I got you.

1512
00:14:37,294 --> 00:14:39,463
That was really great.

1513
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:41,006
Thanks.

1514
00:14:43,342 --> 00:14:45,719
That got me pretty excited.

1515
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:48,889
That's nice.

1516
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:53,685
I mean, I wouldn't mind if someone
did that to me.

1517
00:14:54,144 --> 00:14:57,022
Oh, I get it.
You want me to go down on you.

1518
00:14:59,441 --> 00:15:01,527
I would love to, but I can't.

1519
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:04,404
I have very, very sensitive gums.

1520
00:15:07,074 --> 00:15:10,285
You have gums--
It's a medical condition.

1521
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:14,581
I wouldn't want to cause you
any pain, baby. No.

1522
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:16,708
You're so sweet.

1523
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:26,885
You know, there are other ways to give
me pleasure without using your mouth.

1524
00:15:27,219 --> 00:15:30,222
Oh, God, I am so inconsiderate.
I'm sorry.

1525
00:15:30,472 --> 00:15:33,725
No, that's fine. That's fine.

1526
00:15:38,522 --> 00:15:40,023
Have fun.

1527
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:46,864
-Watch your head.
-This place is a dump.

1528
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:50,242
I really don't want to do this.

1529
00:15:51,243 --> 00:15:56,039
It'll be great. It's our Sunday ritual
and I want you to be part of it.

1530
00:15:56,248 --> 00:16:00,377
I want you to get to know these guys.
You'll love them, honey.

1531
00:16:01,587 --> 00:16:05,966
-Yeah, buddy. What's up, dude?
-What's up, J.D.?

1532
00:16:06,216 --> 00:16:09,136
Judy, awesome to meet you.

1533
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:10,596
Judith.

1534
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:13,891
Judith. And a beer bong for the lady?

1535
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:16,018
-No.
-Totally cool.

1536
00:16:16,226 --> 00:16:18,437
No peer pressure.

1537
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:28,071
Judith rules. Sorry. Come on in.

1538
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:30,490
Check it out. Chewie.

1539
00:16:32,326 --> 00:16:33,660
You want a drink?

1540
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:36,079
-Scotch on the rocks.
-You want ice?

1541
00:16:36,288 --> 00:16:38,248
I'll help you with that.

1542
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,919
Hey, Judith.
Can I give you the grand tour?

1543
00:16:42,503 --> 00:16:45,464
Let's start right here
in the "Hall o' Neil."

1544
00:16:45,756 --> 00:16:49,635
This is Neil, '74. Check this out.

1545
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:53,847
This is a set list
from the Millennium Concert. Look:

1546
00:16:54,097 --> 00:16:56,433
Signed by Neil. Got that on eBay.

1547
00:16:57,267 --> 00:16:58,769
Looks like a Xerox.

1548
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:02,356
No. This cost a lot of money.
Check this out.

1549
00:17:02,606 --> 00:17:05,025
-I think you got taken.
-Ready?

1550
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:06,652
This shirt...

1551
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,654
...was worn by Neil...

1552
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:11,657
...in concert.

1553
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:14,284
Check it out. We snuck backstage...

1554
00:17:14,493 --> 00:17:18,038
...and totally stole it from him
while he was taking a whiz.

1555
00:17:18,247 --> 00:17:21,250
In my profession, we call
your obsession with Neil...

1556
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,794
...a delusional projection fantasy.

1557
00:17:24,002 --> 00:17:28,632
Yeah, sure. But he's America's
greatest songwriter and he's our hero.

1558
00:17:28,841 --> 00:17:31,426
And he's playing the Forum
in two weeks.

1559
00:17:31,635 --> 00:17:36,181
Of course, we can't go because
of the whole restraining order thing.

1560
00:17:44,565 --> 00:17:46,817
Neil, I love you!

1561
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:48,068
You again!

1562
00:17:52,573 --> 00:17:54,283
Neil! Where are you going?

1563
00:17:54,491 --> 00:17:58,412
I want to party with you.
I want to party with you!

1564
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:00,414
Game's on.

1565
00:18:00,414 --> 00:18:01,665
Game's on.

1566
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:06,587
-Give me the remote.
-I want to go.

1567
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:08,714
-Give me a beer.
-We just got here.

1568
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:10,382
These guys are pigs.

1569
00:18:10,591 --> 00:18:13,010
Come on. No, they're not that--

1570
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:15,929
Hey! What are you doing?

1571
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:20,392
Dude, if you get the nachos
stuck together, that's one nacho.

1572
00:18:20,601 --> 00:18:25,189
Okay, look. Why don't we just stay
for a little bit, okay?

1573
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:28,150
Oh, take mine. Take mine.

1574
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,152
Give her the old sweep-a-roo.

1575
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,655
Old Ethel. We've been through
a lot of games together.

1576
00:18:33,906 --> 00:18:35,199
Enjoy.

1577
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:39,036
I'll help you.
She has multiple reclining positions.

1578
00:18:39,244 --> 00:18:41,205
-I can sit forward.
-It's stuck.

1579
00:18:41,872 --> 00:18:43,790
-It's fine.
-Takes a little muscle.

1580
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:46,668
Come on, you fucking piece of shit.

1581
00:18:46,877 --> 00:18:49,046
-I don't need--
-It's no trouble.

1582
00:18:50,714 --> 00:18:51,673
Are you okay?

1583
00:18:51,882 --> 00:18:54,635
I'm sorry. That hardly ever happens.

1584
00:18:54,885 --> 00:18:57,137
You know what? I think I-- Yep.

1585
00:18:57,387 --> 00:19:00,307
It's the lug nut. Fixed it.
Please have a seat.

1586
00:19:01,308 --> 00:19:02,809
I'll stand.

1587
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,811
I'm a--

1588
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:09,983
-Sorry.
-Get me something.

1589
00:19:13,612 --> 00:19:17,074
So Darren tells me
you're a psychologist.

1590
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:19,952
-That's right.
-Interesting.

1591
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,745
I'm in a related field.

1592
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:23,413
Really? What's that?

1593
00:19:23,705 --> 00:19:25,415
Pest and rodent removal.

1594
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:27,793
How is that related?

1595
00:19:28,502 --> 00:19:29,795
We both help people.

1596
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:33,131
While you deal with their emotional
and intellectual needs...

1597
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:36,677
...I protect them from gophers,
coons, roaches, silverfish....

1598
00:19:36,927 --> 00:19:38,136
He launched it.

1599
00:19:38,846 --> 00:19:40,138
Touchdown!

1600
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:55,153
I don't want you to see
Wayne or J.D. ever again, Darren!

1601
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:57,114
But they're my best friends.

1602
00:19:57,364 --> 00:20:01,493
You're getting new friends, and you're
quitting that bullshit band.

1603
00:20:01,869 --> 00:20:06,165
I know you're upset. I do.
But I am not dropping Wayne and J.D...

1604
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:08,458
...and I'm not quitting the band.

1605
00:20:09,001 --> 00:20:11,170
Okay, fine. No more sex.

1606
00:20:11,587 --> 00:20:12,546
What?

1607
00:20:12,713 --> 00:20:14,715
You're not allowed to go down on me
for one month.

1608
00:20:14,923 --> 00:20:16,008
No, Judith, please--

1609
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:19,845
Don't make me take away
your masturbation privileges.

1610
00:20:41,533 --> 00:20:45,496
You go, boys. You sing this song.
You know it. Come on, boys. Sing it!

1611
00:20:45,704 --> 00:20:48,165
-Sing it!
-This blows, man.

1612
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:52,544
Judith's out of control.
We gotta do something.

1613
00:20:52,753 --> 00:20:55,839
Besides ruining the band,
what else has she done?

1614
00:20:56,048 --> 00:20:59,468
Ever since she moved in with him,
she's controlled his life.

1615
00:20:59,676 --> 00:21:02,930
She didn't like his ass.
Made him get butt-cheek implants.

1616
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:10,604
I thought his ass looked tighter.

1617
00:21:10,854 --> 00:21:12,606
Check this out. Last night...

1618
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:15,526
...torched his Neil Diamond albums.

1619
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:17,277
She torched Neil?

1620
00:21:23,617 --> 00:21:25,494
You're right. She's a monster.

1621
00:21:25,702 --> 00:21:27,579
Two, three, four.

1622
00:21:45,931 --> 00:21:47,516
-Hey!
-Yes!

1623
00:21:47,724 --> 00:21:50,102
-Hey, guys, sorry I'm late.
-It's all right.

1624
00:21:50,269 --> 00:21:53,063
I only have a minute.
I have to wax Judith's legs.

1625
00:21:53,272 --> 00:21:55,732
-We miss you.
-We never see you anymore.

1626
00:21:55,941 --> 00:21:57,359
I know, I'm sorry...

1627
00:21:57,568 --> 00:22:00,904
...but I've just been so happy
spending time with Judith.

1628
00:22:01,113 --> 00:22:03,323
Plus, my relationship
counseling sessions--

1629
00:22:03,532 --> 00:22:04,616
Counseling?

1630
00:22:04,825 --> 00:22:07,703
Yeah. I go two hours,
three times a week.

1631
00:22:07,911 --> 00:22:09,621
Oh. Who's your counselor?

1632
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:10,873
Judith.

1633
00:22:11,081 --> 00:22:13,292
We don't think she's right for you.

1634
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,002
Break up with her.

1635
00:22:15,252 --> 00:22:17,796
She's ruining our lives and yours.

1636
00:22:18,005 --> 00:22:20,090
This graph should
illustrate our point.

1637
00:22:20,299 --> 00:22:24,678
Before Judith, our fun level
was at an all-time high: 93.

1638
00:22:24,928 --> 00:22:26,680
It is now an eight.

1639
00:22:26,889 --> 00:22:28,974
Band numbers have
plunged dramatically.

1640
00:22:29,183 --> 00:22:33,896
Girls, never very high, at nine.
But look now. Two!

1641
00:22:34,104 --> 00:22:36,190
This has led to increased wanking off.

1642
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,941
I'm chafing.

1643
00:22:39,276 --> 00:22:41,403
Shit, I gotta go home
and heat the wax.

1644
00:22:41,612 --> 00:22:45,324
Guys, listen.
Thanks for your concern, really.

1645
00:22:45,491 --> 00:22:49,286
I miss you too. But it was great
seeing you, all right?

1646
00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:58,295
That guy's in serious trouble.

1647
00:22:59,129 --> 00:23:01,089
We need to save him.

1648
00:23:03,383 --> 00:23:04,843
Sorry to bother you.

1649
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:06,637
What are you doing here?

1650
00:23:07,304 --> 00:23:09,556
We want to apologize
for the beer shower.

1651
00:23:09,806 --> 00:23:11,725
And the salsa bath. That was bad.

1652
00:23:11,975 --> 00:23:15,187
-Get the hell out of here.
-Just give us a minute, okay?

1653
00:23:15,395 --> 00:23:17,439
My rate is $200 an hour.

1654
00:23:18,315 --> 00:23:19,983
Do you have any money?

1655
00:23:20,651 --> 00:23:22,152
I got some of that.

1656
00:23:24,404 --> 00:23:26,240
Just give me the big bills.

1657
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,784
Six. Is that all you have?

1658
00:23:28,992 --> 00:23:30,828
Thirty. $7.38.

1659
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:36,208
Two and a half minutes.

1660
00:23:36,917 --> 00:23:40,796
We don't want you seeing Darren.
We don't think you're right for him.

1661
00:23:41,004 --> 00:23:42,214
The band needs him.

1662
00:23:42,381 --> 00:23:45,634
-But we're prepared to buy you off.
-With what?

1663
00:23:47,427 --> 00:23:48,929
My house.

1664
00:23:49,179 --> 00:23:50,722
Okay? Look.

1665
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:55,978
My grandma here? She was born in this
house, is buried in the back yard.

1666
00:23:56,562 --> 00:23:57,855
There's my mom...

1667
00:23:58,063 --> 00:24:00,524
...there's my dad and there's me.

1668
00:24:01,191 --> 00:24:04,736
My dad was dropping me
on my head. But...

1669
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:08,740
...we're willing to sign
this over to you...

1670
00:24:08,949 --> 00:24:11,535
...if you just agree
not to see Darren.

1671
00:24:11,743 --> 00:24:14,413
I don't want your shitty house
or your dead grandma.

1672
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,749
I'll throw J.D. in.
He doesn't look like much...

1673
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:19,418
...but he's hung like a horse.

1674
00:24:19,626 --> 00:24:20,919
It's true.

1675
00:24:21,128 --> 00:24:24,298
Look, Darren's mine.
There's nothing you can do about it.

1676
00:24:24,506 --> 00:24:28,218
I own him. He does whatever I say.
I'm in complete control of him.

1677
00:24:28,427 --> 00:24:31,263
He's my puppet
and I'm his puppet master.

1678
00:24:31,471 --> 00:24:33,182
You're not taking Darren away!

1679
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:34,474
Just try to stop me.

1680
00:24:37,019 --> 00:24:38,729
One round, winner takes Darren.

1681
00:24:38,937 --> 00:24:40,022
-You're on.
-Kick her ass.

1682
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:41,315
Go.

1683
00:24:42,316 --> 00:24:45,819
You've got quite a grip.
You must be a heavy masturbator.

1684
00:24:46,028 --> 00:24:48,697
My guess is three times a day?

1685
00:24:48,906 --> 00:24:50,908
I bet you're a premature ejaculator.

1686
00:24:51,116 --> 00:24:52,951
You start off with a big bang.

1687
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,454
Before you know it, you're limp.

1688
00:24:55,913 --> 00:24:59,124
-I win, you lose. Now get out.
-God!

1689
00:25:09,092 --> 00:25:10,511
Hey, check it out.

1690
00:25:14,348 --> 00:25:15,766
Hey, baby.

1691
00:25:16,016 --> 00:25:18,352
Hello, ladies.

1692
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:20,312
So how much?

1693
00:25:20,854 --> 00:25:24,316
Fifty bucks for you,
and 200 for your friend.

1694
00:25:26,485 --> 00:25:28,153
-Okay.
-All right.

1695
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:31,490
I want you to laugh
like he just said something.

1696
00:25:33,408 --> 00:25:34,952
Perfect!

1697
00:25:35,285 --> 00:25:38,497
Get this one.
Be like this. Like this.

1698
00:25:38,705 --> 00:25:39,540
Douche, douche.

1699
00:25:39,915 --> 00:25:41,959
Yeah, you. Slap his ass.

1700
00:25:44,628 --> 00:25:46,630
That's not sexy.

1701
00:25:56,056 --> 00:25:57,724
Watch it.

1702
00:26:00,352 --> 00:26:02,145
You're moving my guy!

1703
00:26:08,527 --> 00:26:10,445
Lookit. Lookit.

1704
00:26:15,325 --> 00:26:16,535
Good.

1705
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:21,081
-Awesome.
-Check this out.

1706
00:26:24,751 --> 00:26:28,088
Mail, check. Go. Don't look back.

1707
00:26:29,256 --> 00:26:30,257
Hurry up. Come on.

1708
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:33,260
Hi, Judith. How's it going?

1709
00:26:33,468 --> 00:26:36,638
Not so good. Look at these.

1710
00:26:39,183 --> 00:26:40,517
Oh, my God.

1711
00:26:42,561 --> 00:26:43,770
He's sick.

1712
00:26:43,979 --> 00:26:44,855
He's perverted.

1713
00:26:45,063 --> 00:26:48,233
-He's cheating on you.
-With two chicks.

1714
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,652
I don't know. I guess I'd dump him?

1715
00:26:50,861 --> 00:26:52,863
-Oh, totally.
-Right?

1716
00:26:53,405 --> 00:26:57,201
Do you guys notice anything weird
about these photos?

1717
00:26:57,409 --> 00:26:59,578
No, that's Darren, all right.

1718
00:27:02,289 --> 00:27:04,708
Darren doesn't have a tattoo.

1719
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:07,836
Nice try, idiots.

1720
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:10,923
If I ever see you near Darren again...

1721
00:27:11,381 --> 00:27:12,799
...I'll kill you.

1722
00:27:24,478 --> 00:27:28,899
Thanks for meeting me here.
I have something important to say.

1723
00:27:29,149 --> 00:27:31,068
Oh, man. You broke up?

1724
00:27:31,318 --> 00:27:32,611
No.

1725
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:37,908
Out of the blue,
Judith proposed to me. We're engaged.

1726
00:27:38,158 --> 00:27:41,161
-What?
-Dude, congratulations.

1727
00:27:42,329 --> 00:27:45,457
Starting next week,
I'll be Mr. Darren Fessbeggler.

1728
00:27:45,666 --> 00:27:49,002
Right, because you're gonna take
her last name, huh?

1729
00:27:49,211 --> 00:27:50,254
Yeah, well...

1730
00:27:50,504 --> 00:27:53,966
...Judith feels, and I think she's got
a really good point here...

1731
00:27:54,174 --> 00:27:57,469
...that it's sexist for the woman
to take the man's last name.

1732
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:00,722
Anyway, it's too late to change it.

1733
00:28:00,931 --> 00:28:03,809
We've already ordered
the monogrammed towels.

1734
00:28:04,309 --> 00:28:05,769
Darren.

1735
00:28:06,103 --> 00:28:07,396
Sandy?

1736
00:28:07,604 --> 00:28:08,897
Sandy Perkus.

1737
00:28:09,106 --> 00:28:12,317
Oh, my God, Darren.
It's been so long.

1738
00:28:12,526 --> 00:28:13,944
Yeah, it has.

1739
00:28:15,195 --> 00:28:16,238
Hey, it's Wayne.

1740
00:28:16,446 --> 00:28:18,991
High school, remember? You remember?

1741
00:28:25,873 --> 00:28:29,084
Right! The senior talent show.

1742
00:28:29,293 --> 00:28:32,171
Yeah, you were booed off the stage.

1743
00:28:33,422 --> 00:28:34,798
That was me.

1744
00:28:35,048 --> 00:28:37,342
Yep. Sandy, remember me?
J.D. McNugent?

1745
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:39,761
I went to the prom...

1746
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:42,973
...with a tuxedo painted
on my naked body.

1747
00:28:43,182 --> 00:28:45,267
Oh, I guess I missed it.

1748
00:28:45,642 --> 00:28:50,022
I spilled a drink and the paint ran
and everyone could see my dong.

1749
00:28:50,397 --> 00:28:52,900
It doesn't ring a bell.

1750
00:28:54,234 --> 00:28:57,821
Remember, in science, I was lighting
farts with the Bunsen burner...

1751
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:00,324
...and I singed my ball sac?

1752
00:29:01,909 --> 00:29:02,951
No.

1753
00:29:03,202 --> 00:29:06,830
Man. I still can't grow hair
on my left nut.

1754
00:29:07,289 --> 00:29:08,832
Sucks.

1755
00:29:10,209 --> 00:29:12,169
So how are you?

1756
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:15,130
Great. Great.
I just moved back to town.

1757
00:29:15,339 --> 00:29:16,965
Oh, wow, that's great.

1758
00:29:17,758 --> 00:29:21,637
Gosh, you know, I have to go,
but it was great seeing you.

1759
00:29:21,845 --> 00:29:24,431
Yeah, same here. Me too.

1760
00:29:27,017 --> 00:29:28,393
-See you.
-Take care.

1761
00:29:28,602 --> 00:29:29,728
-Okay, bye.
-Awesome.

1762
00:29:29,937 --> 00:29:32,356
Yeah, bye. Bye.

1763
00:29:34,608 --> 00:29:35,984
Oh, my God.

1764
00:29:36,193 --> 00:29:37,694
-This is it!
-What?

1765
00:29:37,945 --> 00:29:42,074
It's your big chance. Sandy Perkus
has just walked back into your life.

1766
00:29:42,616 --> 00:29:45,994
You even said so yourself.
She was your one and only someone!

1767
00:29:46,203 --> 00:29:49,414
She used to be.
Now Judith is my one and only someone.

1768
00:29:49,623 --> 00:29:52,626
I'll talk to you guys later. Okay?

1769
00:29:53,293 --> 00:29:56,296
Isn't "one and only" like, one...

1770
00:29:57,673 --> 00:29:59,091
...and only?

1771
00:30:06,223 --> 00:30:08,809
-Here's your drink.
-Where's the lemon wedge?

1772
00:30:09,017 --> 00:30:11,520
We're out of lemons,
but I'll run to the store--

1773
00:30:11,728 --> 00:30:14,731
Forget it. I want you to meet
two exciting people.

1774
00:30:15,524 --> 00:30:18,277
Brett is a tax attorney,
and Clayton's a CPA.

1775
00:30:18,485 --> 00:30:20,988
Wow, that is exciting.

1776
00:30:21,155 --> 00:30:22,781
This is my fiancé, Darren.

1777
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:24,408
-Pleased to meet you.
-Same.

1778
00:30:24,616 --> 00:30:26,326
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

1779
00:30:26,535 --> 00:30:27,828
Excuse me, I'll get it.

1780
00:30:34,459 --> 00:30:38,172
Is Darren here?
I think he left his Vespa helmet.

1781
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,381
What's going on?

1782
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,800
We're having our engagement party.

1783
00:30:42,009 --> 00:30:46,722
Oh, then I guess our invitations
must've been lost in the mail.

1784
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:48,515
No.

1785
00:30:48,765 --> 00:30:52,477
I think it's very possible
she didn't even send us invitations.

1786
00:30:54,313 --> 00:30:56,940
-Thanks for stopping by.
-Who's Darren talking to?

1787
00:30:57,357 --> 00:30:59,359
Those are his new friends.

1788
00:31:02,488 --> 00:31:04,573
-I'll have a merlot.
-A spritzer.

1789
00:31:05,282 --> 00:31:08,160
-We don't work here.
-You fooled me.

1790
00:31:08,368 --> 00:31:11,038
-My name's Brett, this is Clayton.
-This is Darren.

1791
00:31:11,246 --> 00:31:14,208
Yeah, we know who he is, Clayton.

1792
00:31:14,374 --> 00:31:18,003
-Darren's our friend, Brett.
-We knew him first.

1793
00:31:18,212 --> 00:31:20,047
Fuck you, replacement friend!

1794
00:31:20,255 --> 00:31:22,883
Eat this, fake Wayne!

1795
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:28,514
Stop it! Do something!

1796
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:36,313
Get out of here!

1797
00:31:43,737 --> 00:31:45,239
Hey, this isn't over yet!

1798
00:31:45,447 --> 00:31:47,199
We're not giving up on Darren!

1799
00:31:54,998 --> 00:31:57,376
She thinks this gig is over.

1800
00:31:57,584 --> 00:31:59,336
It's not over. No!

1801
00:31:59,586 --> 00:32:02,881
But we are taking this into overtime!

1802
00:32:03,924 --> 00:32:05,968
Yeah! Okay, strategy session.

1803
00:32:06,468 --> 00:32:09,638
-Okay, our enemy is wicked.
-Dude, she's Freddy Krueger.

1804
00:32:09,847 --> 00:32:11,598
-No, Damien.
-Dude, she's Vader.

1805
00:32:11,807 --> 00:32:13,559
No, she is the Emperor!

1806
00:32:13,767 --> 00:32:15,227
But with really great tits.

1807
00:32:15,435 --> 00:32:18,814
Okay, now, Sandy?
That girl, she's a nice girl.

1808
00:32:19,022 --> 00:32:20,899
-She's a sweetheart.
-Dude, a saint.

1809
00:32:21,108 --> 00:32:22,401
-A goddess.
-A princess.

1810
00:32:22,609 --> 00:32:25,445
You know what?
She's kind of like Mother Teresa.

1811
00:32:25,654 --> 00:32:27,239
But with way better tits.

1812
00:32:27,447 --> 00:32:30,909
And Darren loves Sandy
no matter what he says.

1813
00:32:31,118 --> 00:32:32,077
Definitely.

1814
00:32:32,286 --> 00:32:35,247
That's why we have to intervene
and fix the problem!

1815
00:32:35,455 --> 00:32:37,457
-Definitely!
-All right!

1816
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:41,879
We're gonna kidnap Judith
and set Darren up with Sandy.

1817
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:45,757
What?

1818
00:32:51,638 --> 00:32:54,016
The bat is leaving the cave.

1819
00:32:54,808 --> 00:32:56,727
Roger that.

1820
00:33:13,702 --> 00:33:17,289
Alarm system has been deactivated.
Out.

1821
00:33:17,498 --> 00:33:18,999
Roger that.

1822
00:33:19,875 --> 00:33:21,668
Dude, you don't have to do the--

1823
00:33:21,877 --> 00:33:24,463
--sound. It already does that. Out.

1824
00:33:24,671 --> 00:33:26,673
Copy that.
I'm not going to make the--

1825
00:33:26,882 --> 00:33:29,635
--sound after I say stuff
from now on.

1826
00:33:31,011 --> 00:33:32,137
Shady McNugent...

1827
00:33:32,346 --> 00:33:33,639
...over and out.

1828
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,433
That was the last one.

1829
00:33:47,694 --> 00:33:50,739
-I'm scared. What if we get caught?
-Not gonna happen.

1830
00:33:57,037 --> 00:33:58,664
I'm hungry.

1831
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:00,666
We'll eat later.

1832
00:34:00,874 --> 00:34:04,545
-Can we go to Happy Burger?
-Yes, after the kidnapping.

1833
00:34:04,753 --> 00:34:07,047
I'm gonna get a Chubby Checker with--

1834
00:34:08,924 --> 00:34:10,509
With cheese.

1835
00:34:26,859 --> 00:34:28,318
What?

1836
00:34:36,827 --> 00:34:41,081
You go downstairs and I'll check
upstairs. Do the Navy SEAL signals.

1837
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:44,209
I only know the Air Force signals.

1838
00:34:44,877 --> 00:34:46,461
I'll be on the lookout.

1839
00:34:46,712 --> 00:34:47,963
God!

1840
00:34:55,929 --> 00:34:58,724
-I haven't located heryet.
-Me neither.

1841
00:34:59,391 --> 00:35:00,517
Keep checking.

1842
00:35:01,101 --> 00:35:05,355
Wait a second. I think I see
something in the back of the refrig--

1843
00:35:06,023 --> 00:35:07,566
In the back of the closet.

1844
00:35:08,066 --> 00:35:09,276
Check it out.

1845
00:35:09,776 --> 00:35:11,904
Nope. Coast is clear.

1846
00:35:12,112 --> 00:35:16,575
I'll keep looking down here, buddy.
You keep an eye peeled up there.

1847
00:35:33,926 --> 00:35:34,968
Oh, shit.

1848
00:35:36,803 --> 00:35:37,804
What is it?

1849
00:35:38,055 --> 00:35:40,724
I'm hit. I need backup.

1850
00:35:41,642 --> 00:35:42,851
I'm coming.

1851
00:35:46,271 --> 00:35:47,523
What happ--

1852
00:36:14,049 --> 00:36:15,676
Help!

1853
00:36:31,859 --> 00:36:33,777
Dead leg.

1854
00:36:36,029 --> 00:36:37,823
Help me, Wayne.

1855
00:36:44,663 --> 00:36:46,123
Oh, my God.

1856
00:36:59,303 --> 00:37:02,514
Get the door. Get the door. Door.

1857
00:37:33,504 --> 00:37:36,089
Darren, I'm leaving you.
We're finished. Done.

1858
00:37:36,423 --> 00:37:38,509
Don't call, write, e-mail or fax.

1859
00:37:38,717 --> 00:37:41,845
I never want to see your face
oryour fake butt again.

1860
00:38:13,252 --> 00:38:14,419
Okay, get down there.

1861
00:38:14,962 --> 00:38:16,922
Dude, wait. Why me?

1862
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:21,051
Because you're guarding Judith.
I'm dealing with Darren and Sandy.

1863
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:24,304
But when we let her go,
she'll be able to identify me.

1864
00:38:24,555 --> 00:38:28,267
No. She won't be able to
because you'll be wearing this.

1865
00:38:28,475 --> 00:38:32,479
But after we let her go, the cops will
look for a guy dressed as a bird.

1866
00:38:32,729 --> 00:38:34,940
-So?
-So, what am I gonna wear to work?

1867
00:38:35,148 --> 00:38:36,358
Your work clothes.

1868
00:38:36,567 --> 00:38:38,610
But tomorrow's casual Friday.

1869
00:38:39,153 --> 00:38:41,405
Get downstairs!

1870
00:38:48,036 --> 00:38:49,329
Who the hell are you?

1871
00:39:09,641 --> 00:39:12,436
Thanks for meeting me.
I called you out of the blue--

1872
00:39:12,644 --> 00:39:16,607
That's okay. I love catching up
with old high school friends.

1873
00:39:16,815 --> 00:39:18,650
-Are you single?
-Yes.

1874
00:39:18,859 --> 00:39:22,988
Great. Look, I wanted to talk
to you about Darren Silverman.

1875
00:39:23,197 --> 00:39:24,573
He's a really good guy.

1876
00:39:24,823 --> 00:39:27,659
You know what?
He works with the elderly.

1877
00:39:27,868 --> 00:39:29,119
Really?

1878
00:39:29,495 --> 00:39:32,706
-That is so sweet.
-He still talks about you.

1879
00:39:32,915 --> 00:39:33,916
There's something--

1880
00:39:34,166 --> 00:39:37,711
He even writes poems about you.
In fact...

1881
00:39:38,212 --> 00:39:39,505
...I think he loves you.

1882
00:39:40,005 --> 00:39:42,382
Wayne, I'm gonna become a nun.

1883
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,970
In a week, I take my final vows.

1884
00:39:47,179 --> 00:39:50,557
I didn't even know
that you were religious.

1885
00:39:50,766 --> 00:39:52,392
I wasn't in high school.

1886
00:39:52,601 --> 00:39:56,355
But after I graduated,
I joined my parents in the circus.

1887
00:39:56,563 --> 00:39:58,232
And I became a trapeze artist.

1888
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,861
I fell in love
with mypartner, Luigi Panini.

1889
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:07,032
Ladies and gentlemen,
the fabulous Luigi!

1890
00:40:07,282 --> 00:40:10,035
And everything was perfect until....

1891
00:40:10,202 --> 00:40:12,412
Talent scouts were in the audience.

1892
00:40:12,746 --> 00:40:14,748
Luigi wanted to impress them.

1893
00:40:14,957 --> 00:40:18,252
He was a great trapeze artist,
but he was completely vain.

1894
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:21,338
And now Luigi will attempt
the most dangerous stunt...

1895
00:40:21,547 --> 00:40:23,173
...in the history of trapeze...

1896
00:40:23,382 --> 00:40:26,009
...the Quadruple Bierman.

1897
00:40:41,775 --> 00:40:43,735
Luigi!

1898
00:40:46,071 --> 00:40:48,115
-Wow.
-Yeah.

1899
00:40:48,323 --> 00:40:52,452
After Luigi died,
I knew I would never love again.

1900
00:40:52,661 --> 00:40:57,332
That's when I decided to devote my life
to serving God and helping others.

1901
00:40:57,583 --> 00:41:01,461
So you haven't taken
your final vows yet, right?

1902
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:06,675
-Right.
-So technically, you're not a nun yet.

1903
00:41:06,925 --> 00:41:09,261
Well, no. I mean, not yet.

1904
00:41:09,469 --> 00:41:12,264
So why not then just
have lunch with Darren?

1905
00:41:14,641 --> 00:41:16,810
I can't figure out why Judith left.

1906
00:41:17,019 --> 00:41:20,480
It doesn't make any sense.
She didn't even take her clothes.

1907
00:41:20,689 --> 00:41:24,568
Maybe she went where she didn't
need clothes: a nudist colony.

1908
00:41:24,776 --> 00:41:27,112
-I don't think so.
-Maybe she got kidnapped.

1909
00:41:27,654 --> 00:41:29,531
-You think?
-No.

1910
00:41:29,781 --> 00:41:31,867
Definitely not. That's impossible.

1911
00:41:32,117 --> 00:41:35,370
It's like, why would that
happen in a world?

1912
00:41:35,746 --> 00:41:37,414
Maybe she's a lesbo.

1913
00:41:37,873 --> 00:41:38,790
Come on.

1914
00:41:38,999 --> 00:41:41,084
Maybe she's a herm.

1915
00:41:42,461 --> 00:41:44,421
-What?
-A hermaphrodite.

1916
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:46,673
Little dick, little puss.

1917
00:41:50,427 --> 00:41:52,721
-Guess who I bumped into today.
-Who?

1918
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:56,433
Sandy Perkus,
and she wants to see you.

1919
00:41:56,642 --> 00:41:59,520
-I'm engaged to Judith, Wayne.
-She dumped you, dude.

1920
00:41:59,686 --> 00:42:02,689
Just have lunch with Sandy.
What's it gonna hurt?

1921
00:42:02,856 --> 00:42:05,442
No way. Judith's coming back.

1922
00:42:06,026 --> 00:42:07,361
What if she doesn't?

1923
00:42:07,611 --> 00:42:10,614
As long as Judith's alive,
I'll never give up on her.

1924
00:42:10,823 --> 00:42:12,449
Okay? Okay?

1925
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:20,874
I got it. Crowbar me.

1926
00:42:24,002 --> 00:42:25,128
Oh, my God.

1927
00:42:25,379 --> 00:42:28,674
-What is it?
-This dead chick is really stacked.

1928
00:42:34,054 --> 00:42:35,556
Okay, go, go. Go.

1929
00:42:37,057 --> 00:42:39,059
-What are you doing?
-Jacket's caught.

1930
00:42:39,226 --> 00:42:40,394
Take it off!

1931
00:42:40,644 --> 00:42:42,229
I love this jacket!

1932
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:43,981
Lose it!

1933
00:43:00,998 --> 00:43:05,002
Damn! That was my favorite jacket.

1934
00:43:08,881 --> 00:43:11,925
In a bizarre incident last night,
Judith Fessbeggler...

1935
00:43:12,134 --> 00:43:14,928
...was incinerated beyond
recognition when herBMW...

1936
00:43:15,179 --> 00:43:16,889
...careened offa cliff.

1937
00:43:17,097 --> 00:43:21,518
Investigators have declared it an
accident. No foul play is suspected.

1938
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,940
In unrelated news, the body of
deceased local Joan Snerd...

1939
00:43:27,191 --> 00:43:31,778
...was dug up in a grave robbing last
night. Police arrested three Cubans.

1940
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:46,418
-Why are you doing this?
-So you can eat and have clothes.

1941
00:43:47,419 --> 00:43:49,129
No, why did you kidnap me?

1942
00:43:49,379 --> 00:43:51,215
I'm not supposed to tell you.

1943
00:43:51,465 --> 00:43:54,218
Oh, I get it.
The other guy's the boss.

1944
00:43:55,761 --> 00:43:58,639
No, I make decisions too.

1945
00:43:58,972 --> 00:44:00,724
I suggested that.

1946
00:44:01,308 --> 00:44:02,684
An outhouse. Clever.

1947
00:44:02,893 --> 00:44:03,852
Thanks.

1948
00:44:04,061 --> 00:44:06,688
-You must be very well-educated.
-I suppose.

1949
00:44:06,897 --> 00:44:08,899
-Ivy League?
-More or less.

1950
00:44:09,107 --> 00:44:12,152
-Which one? Yale, Harvard, Princeton?
-S.U.

1951
00:44:12,402 --> 00:44:13,821
Oh, Stanford University?

1952
00:44:16,114 --> 00:44:18,075
Subway University.

1953
00:44:18,325 --> 00:44:22,246
I knew someone who went there.
Did you know J.D. McNugent?

1954
00:44:22,454 --> 00:44:26,291
No. No. Never heard
of such a person, ever.

1955
00:44:27,835 --> 00:44:30,838
-See you later, J.D.
-Take it easy, Judith.

1956
00:44:32,756 --> 00:44:34,383
Goddamn it!

1957
00:44:34,591 --> 00:44:37,970
-She knows who we are?!
-There was nothing I could do.

1958
00:44:38,178 --> 00:44:41,723
She used her super-intellect on me.
She's like Hannibal Lecter.

1959
00:44:41,932 --> 00:44:45,769
-Great. Now we can't let her go.
-So, what are we going to do?

1960
00:44:47,312 --> 00:44:48,564
-Coach.
-Coach!

1961
00:44:48,772 --> 00:44:51,400
If it ain't my favorite
third-string quarterback...

1962
00:44:51,608 --> 00:44:54,611
...and the best damn mascot
Wheaton High School ever had.

1963
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:56,655
Lookit, he's still got it!

1964
00:44:57,990 --> 00:45:01,493
It's good seeing you boys.
Thank you for coming to my trial.

1965
00:45:01,702 --> 00:45:05,122
No problem. We were happy to act
as witnesses on your behalf.

1966
00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:07,958
That ref blew.
He deserved what he got.

1967
00:45:11,837 --> 00:45:13,130
Touchdown!

1968
00:45:13,505 --> 00:45:15,841
No touchdown. He's out-of-bounds.

1969
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:17,885
-What?!
-He's out-of-bounds.

1970
00:45:32,566 --> 00:45:37,362
You think after you get out of prison
they'll let you get your old job back?

1971
00:45:37,529 --> 00:45:40,324
Well, boys, I don't think so.

1972
00:45:40,532 --> 00:45:42,284
So when will they let you out?

1973
00:45:42,493 --> 00:45:46,038
Well, I've got an appeal pending,
but it doesn't look good.

1974
00:45:46,246 --> 00:45:49,333
The victim's whiny
family's protesting.

1975
00:45:49,541 --> 00:45:51,585
What's their damn problem?

1976
00:45:52,211 --> 00:45:53,962
So, what brings you boys here?

1977
00:45:54,171 --> 00:45:56,215
Well, coach, we need your advice.

1978
00:45:56,423 --> 00:45:57,716
Okay, shoot.

1979
00:45:57,925 --> 00:46:00,511
Darren fell in love
with this girl, Judith.

1980
00:46:00,719 --> 00:46:03,722
-And we kidnapped her.
-Kill her.

1981
00:46:04,348 --> 00:46:06,558
Wait a minute and let me finish.

1982
00:46:06,767 --> 00:46:10,270
So we screwed up because now
she knows who we are.

1983
00:46:10,521 --> 00:46:13,607
So we can't let her go,
or she'll turn us in.

1984
00:46:13,857 --> 00:46:15,400
Is that everything?

1985
00:46:18,362 --> 00:46:19,613
Kill her.

1986
00:46:20,697 --> 00:46:22,157
We can't kill her.

1987
00:46:22,366 --> 00:46:25,994
You can! Wheaton Warbirds can do
anything they put their minds to.

1988
00:46:26,203 --> 00:46:29,456
But, coach, I mean, come on,
actually kill a person?

1989
00:46:29,915 --> 00:46:32,417
What is it that I always said?

1990
00:46:32,626 --> 00:46:35,170
If you can dream it, you can do it.

1991
00:46:35,379 --> 00:46:36,421
Exactly.

1992
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:40,843
You have the dream. All you have
to do is turn it into reality.

1993
00:46:41,051 --> 00:46:42,678
-Okay.
-Thattaboy!

1994
00:46:42,928 --> 00:46:44,763
Now, go on home and snuff her.

1995
00:46:44,972 --> 00:46:47,224
-Come on, move.
-Thanks, coach.

1996
00:46:53,021 --> 00:46:54,481
Where's your bird suit?

1997
00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:57,442
I don't need it, because we're--

1998
00:46:58,819 --> 00:47:01,697
Because we're gonna kill you. Right?

1999
00:47:03,782 --> 00:47:05,701
You aren't going to shoot me.

2000
00:47:05,909 --> 00:47:07,327
What makes you say that?

2001
00:47:07,661 --> 00:47:09,204
Because you're not killers.

2002
00:47:09,413 --> 00:47:10,497
Sure we are.

2003
00:47:10,706 --> 00:47:12,124
You've never killed anyone.

2004
00:47:12,332 --> 00:47:13,333
I killed a man once.

2005
00:47:13,542 --> 00:47:14,501
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

2006
00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:17,296
-Who?
-Kevin Beckley.

2007
00:47:17,504 --> 00:47:20,507
You didn't kill Kevin Beckley.
He died in a car wreck.

2008
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:24,845
-She doesn't know that. Goddamn it.
-You see?

2009
00:47:25,053 --> 00:47:28,473
You guys have never killed anything
in your entire lives.

2010
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:32,811
One time, this squirrel ran out
into the street and I ran over him...

2011
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:37,566
...and he didn't die right then, but
I'm pretty sure he died right after.

2012
00:47:38,275 --> 00:47:42,237
It doesn't matter if we've killed
or not! We're gonna do it right now!

2013
00:47:42,446 --> 00:47:44,656
-Ready?!
-Ready.

2014
00:47:46,867 --> 00:47:49,119
-Do it.
-I can't!

2015
00:47:49,369 --> 00:47:50,746
Goddamn it!

2016
00:47:59,922 --> 00:48:02,466
-Okay, it's Tuesday.
-So?

2017
00:48:02,716 --> 00:48:04,760
So you're meeting Sandy for lunch.

2018
00:48:04,968 --> 00:48:06,595
Can't you see I'm in mourning?

2019
00:48:06,803 --> 00:48:10,265
But you promised you'd be there.
You gave her your word.

2020
00:48:10,724 --> 00:48:12,434
I didn't even talk to her.

2021
00:48:12,643 --> 00:48:14,853
Okay, I gave her your word.

2022
00:48:15,062 --> 00:48:19,691
For God's sakes, when will you give up
this idea that I'll go out with Sandy?

2023
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:22,194
When you go out with Sandy.

2024
00:48:23,821 --> 00:48:25,489
Now, come on.

2025
00:48:26,448 --> 00:48:29,576
Come on. Come on. Come on, come on.

2026
00:48:39,294 --> 00:48:41,839
Come on! All right! Come on!

2027
00:48:46,301 --> 00:48:48,971
Hey! Wow, you're wearing the--

2028
00:48:49,179 --> 00:48:51,390
I'm training to become a nun.

2029
00:48:51,598 --> 00:48:54,059
A nun. Well, that explains it.

2030
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:57,396
-I hope it doesn't freak you out.
-No, it doesn't.

2031
00:48:57,604 --> 00:48:59,898
Actually, I'm relieved.

2032
00:49:00,107 --> 00:49:04,069
I think Wayne was trying
to set us up on a date.

2033
00:49:04,278 --> 00:49:07,823
Oh, yeah.
He's got some crazy ideas.

2034
00:49:08,031 --> 00:49:12,286
Yeah. Well, now that I know
that you're unavailable...

2035
00:49:12,494 --> 00:49:13,829
...it makes this easier.

2036
00:49:14,037 --> 00:49:15,539
We can just be friends.

2037
00:49:15,789 --> 00:49:17,207
Exactly. Friends.

2038
00:49:17,875 --> 00:49:19,084
Please.

2039
00:49:19,668 --> 00:49:21,545
-Thank you.
-Sure.

2040
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,423
So how are your parents?

2041
00:49:24,631 --> 00:49:27,759
Oh, great. They're making
a fortune on the lnternet.

2042
00:49:27,968 --> 00:49:30,721
They started their own Web site,
circusfreak.com.

2043
00:49:31,513 --> 00:49:32,890
Wow, good for them.

2044
00:49:33,223 --> 00:49:35,267
And how's your brother, Dog-face Boy?

2045
00:49:35,475 --> 00:49:36,852
He got rabies.

2046
00:49:37,269 --> 00:49:39,271
-God, that's too bad.
-Yeah.

2047
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:42,399
We thought we were gonna
have to put him down...

2048
00:49:42,608 --> 00:49:44,151
...but he recovered.

2049
00:49:44,359 --> 00:49:46,153
Oh, good. Good.

2050
00:49:46,361 --> 00:49:47,779
So how are you?

2051
00:49:47,988 --> 00:49:50,282
Oh, me? I'm great.

2052
00:49:50,532 --> 00:49:53,952
Yeah, everything's been
really good, you know?

2053
00:49:54,119 --> 00:49:55,454
Yeah.

2054
00:49:56,914 --> 00:49:58,790
Well, my fiancée died.

2055
00:49:59,041 --> 00:50:00,083
She died?

2056
00:50:00,292 --> 00:50:01,251
Yeah, she's dead.

2057
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:03,420
-I am so sorry.
-Oh, don't be.

2058
00:50:03,629 --> 00:50:05,881
Please don't be sorry.

2059
00:50:06,381 --> 00:50:08,133
It's nothing.

2060
00:50:09,426 --> 00:50:12,137
So how do you feel about....

2061
00:50:17,017 --> 00:50:18,393
Oh, no.

2062
00:50:18,602 --> 00:50:23,190
Oh, gosh. Just cry. Let it out.

2063
00:50:23,398 --> 00:50:26,610
I'm here for you, okay?
I'm here for you.

2064
00:50:26,819 --> 00:50:28,070
Thank you.

2065
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:42,125
Wait a minute. Wait.
You're a Neil Diamond fan too?

2066
00:50:42,334 --> 00:50:44,920
Oh! The man's a genius.

2067
00:50:45,128 --> 00:50:46,505
Yeah!

2068
00:50:46,672 --> 00:50:50,384
He's the greatest songwriter-performer
of this or any generation.

2069
00:50:50,592 --> 00:50:51,593
I know.

2070
00:51:04,481 --> 00:51:06,108
Oh, God.

2071
00:51:13,365 --> 00:51:15,033
I brought you some more videos.

2072
00:51:15,242 --> 00:51:17,703
You got your choice:
Porno or monster trucks.

2073
00:51:17,870 --> 00:51:19,913
-And I got one that's both.
-Thanks, J.D.

2074
00:51:20,122 --> 00:51:22,875
I really appreciate you
taking care of me.

2075
00:51:23,417 --> 00:51:24,418
My pleasure.

2076
00:51:24,626 --> 00:51:28,088
Hey, you strike me as
a pretty responsible guy.

2077
00:51:28,297 --> 00:51:29,298
Thanks.

2078
00:51:29,506 --> 00:51:33,010
That's why I'm surprised
that you let Wayne boss you around.

2079
00:51:34,928 --> 00:51:35,971
Wayne's not--

2080
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:39,641
No one bosses me around.
Wayne's not the boss of me.

2081
00:51:40,017 --> 00:51:44,021
Yeah. I think that you
seem depressed and confused.

2082
00:51:44,229 --> 00:51:45,606
You think?

2083
00:51:45,814 --> 00:51:48,400
You have a self-defeating
personality disorder.

2084
00:51:50,569 --> 00:51:52,321
Have you considered therapy?

2085
00:51:54,448 --> 00:51:58,202
I remember in high school, you were
really into helping people.

2086
00:51:58,410 --> 00:52:01,205
At parties, you were always
the designated driver.

2087
00:52:01,413 --> 00:52:04,333
Right. And I remember you
were a really good dancer.

2088
00:52:04,541 --> 00:52:08,420
And strong too. You used to be
able to lift me up over your head.

2089
00:52:08,629 --> 00:52:10,047
Still can.

2090
00:52:10,297 --> 00:52:11,590
Oh, really?

2091
00:52:12,466 --> 00:52:14,593
Ready? And....

2092
00:52:19,014 --> 00:52:20,516
-Oh, Darren!
-Help me!

2093
00:52:20,724 --> 00:52:22,351
Are you okay?

2094
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:23,769
-I can't--
-Just hang on.

2095
00:52:25,896 --> 00:52:27,105
I can't swim.

2096
00:52:43,705 --> 00:52:44,873
Darren!

2097
00:52:45,833 --> 00:52:47,417
Are you okay?

2098
00:52:47,668 --> 00:52:50,754
Thank you. Thank you for saving me.

2099
00:52:52,506 --> 00:52:54,091
No problem.

2100
00:53:03,225 --> 00:53:06,979
Let it out now. There you go.

2101
00:53:09,189 --> 00:53:10,149
Come on.

2102
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:11,733
Let's go, okay?

2103
00:53:15,571 --> 00:53:18,323
You're a lot stronger
than you were in high school.

2104
00:53:18,490 --> 00:53:21,910
Yeah, well, the convent's
got a great gym.

2105
00:53:25,330 --> 00:53:28,208
And ever since then,
I've been afraid of toilets.

2106
00:53:28,417 --> 00:53:30,711
What else can I say
about second grade?

2107
00:53:30,919 --> 00:53:32,588
J.D., let's fast-forward.

2108
00:53:32,796 --> 00:53:35,674
-Have you ever had a girlfriend?
-Yes.

2109
00:53:35,841 --> 00:53:36,842
No.

2110
00:53:37,092 --> 00:53:40,179
Have you ever fantasized
about having sex with a man?

2111
00:53:40,387 --> 00:53:41,847
-Which man?
-Any man.

2112
00:53:42,055 --> 00:53:44,349
-You mean, like, a tall man?
-Sure, whatever.

2113
00:53:44,558 --> 00:53:47,352
-I don't like tall people.
-How about a short man?

2114
00:53:47,603 --> 00:53:52,024
How short? Sometimes people can be
too short. That's weird, like midgets.

2115
00:53:52,357 --> 00:53:56,069
Have you fantasized about having
sex with any man? Any man at all?

2116
00:53:56,278 --> 00:53:58,614
Does that include celebrities?

2117
00:54:00,949 --> 00:54:02,993
-Can I ask you something?
-Sure.

2118
00:54:03,202 --> 00:54:07,206
I mean, not that it matters now...

2119
00:54:07,831 --> 00:54:12,628
...but if I had asked you out back
in high school, would you have gone?

2120
00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:15,088
Definitely.

2121
00:54:16,465 --> 00:54:19,510
-Not that it matters now, you know.
-Right.

2122
00:54:24,556 --> 00:54:26,475
-Perfect.
-Thanks.

2123
00:54:27,434 --> 00:54:29,812
Could you, you know, turn around?

2124
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:31,522
Right. Yeah, certainly.

2125
00:54:40,322 --> 00:54:41,990
I have these.

2126
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:45,702
Sorry, sorry, those are....

2127
00:54:46,286 --> 00:54:47,246
Thanks.

2128
00:55:00,050 --> 00:55:02,469
-Can you zip me up?
-Yeah.

2129
00:55:05,514 --> 00:55:07,349
I had a really good time.

2130
00:55:07,558 --> 00:55:08,809
Me too.

2131
00:55:09,017 --> 00:55:11,520
-Do you want to have dinner tonight?
-I can't.

2132
00:55:11,728 --> 00:55:14,481
Tomorrow I have a test in my
catechism class...

2133
00:55:14,690 --> 00:55:19,486
...and I have to score at least an 85
so I can take my vows on Sunday.

2134
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:21,071
What about tomorrow?

2135
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:25,617
I'm scheduled to take care
of an elderly nun on her death bed.

2136
00:55:25,993 --> 00:55:27,327
I understand.

2137
00:55:27,536 --> 00:55:29,872
But I'd really like to see you again.

2138
00:55:30,998 --> 00:55:32,583
I'll get out of it.

2139
00:55:33,083 --> 00:55:33,125
I always knew I was different,
and now I know why.

2140
00:55:33,125 --> 00:55:36,378
I always knew I was different,
and now I know why.

2141
00:55:36,587 --> 00:55:38,589
I'm gay.

2142
00:55:39,506 --> 00:55:43,677
You're the only person
who's ever truly understood me.

2143
00:55:43,886 --> 00:55:46,680
It's okay. Just let it out.

2144
00:55:46,889 --> 00:55:48,724
Everything will be all right.

2145
00:55:48,932 --> 00:55:51,476
It's all gonna be okay.

2146
00:55:51,685 --> 00:55:53,353
It's gonna be just--

2147
00:56:31,808 --> 00:56:33,811
Judith escaped.

2148
00:56:34,853 --> 00:56:35,854
Der!

2149
00:56:40,734 --> 00:56:44,780
Get to the truck. Go. Go. Go. Go.

2150
00:56:58,043 --> 00:57:00,504
Okay, she can't be far.

2151
00:57:02,256 --> 00:57:03,215
I see her!

2152
00:57:03,423 --> 00:57:05,050
Where? Okay, steady, steady!

2153
00:57:07,886 --> 00:57:08,971
I missed her.

2154
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:16,395
Now. Let's go. Go, go!

2155
00:57:16,603 --> 00:57:18,856
You go this way,
I'll go that way! Go!

2156
00:57:27,990 --> 00:57:30,576
Open up! I've been kidnapped!

2157
00:57:32,911 --> 00:57:34,288
Hold your goddamn horses!

2158
00:57:34,746 --> 00:57:36,081
Oh, thank God. Hurry up.

2159
00:57:40,836 --> 00:57:43,255
Tonight Mr. Chang gets lucky.

2160
00:57:45,465 --> 00:57:47,593
Young lady, so horny, so impatient.

2161
00:57:52,431 --> 00:57:54,766
Oh, scrotum!

2162
00:57:56,685 --> 00:57:59,354
Dude, she's stealing the truck!
Come on!

2163
00:58:03,275 --> 00:58:05,736
-Now! I got her.
-Do her! Come on!

2164
00:58:06,069 --> 00:58:07,613
I got her.

2165
00:58:17,122 --> 00:58:19,124
Okay, Judith, it's over.

2166
00:58:19,374 --> 00:58:23,045
You might as well turn around
and head back to the house.

2167
00:58:35,641 --> 00:58:36,642
Oh, thank God.

2168
00:58:59,790 --> 00:59:02,709
Hi, officers. You're safe.

2169
00:59:03,085 --> 00:59:04,878
I'm Cowboy Wayne.

2170
00:59:05,379 --> 00:59:08,549
I just bagged me
one of them killer goats...

2171
00:59:08,757 --> 00:59:11,426
...that escaped from the zoo.

2172
00:59:12,344 --> 00:59:14,012
-Good job.
-Yeah.

2173
00:59:14,263 --> 00:59:16,932
Okay, then, I'll see you later.

2174
00:59:30,028 --> 00:59:32,406
There. That should
hold you for tonight.

2175
00:59:33,615 --> 00:59:34,867
Don't!

2176
00:59:40,038 --> 00:59:41,874
What the hell happened?

2177
00:59:42,916 --> 00:59:44,877
Judith was giving me some therapy...

2178
00:59:45,043 --> 00:59:47,546
...and helped me realize
I was gay and--

2179
00:59:47,796 --> 00:59:49,339
Wait. What?

2180
00:59:50,299 --> 00:59:51,633
I see what happened.

2181
00:59:52,676 --> 00:59:54,386
She messed with your head.

2182
00:59:54,636 --> 00:59:56,263
Wayne, I'm gay.

2183
00:59:56,471 --> 00:59:59,933
No, you're not.
You're just unsuccessful with women.

2184
01:00:00,142 --> 01:00:04,396
No, I'm gay. Judith got me
in touch with the inner J.D.

2185
01:00:04,563 --> 01:00:05,689
How'd she do that?

2186
01:00:05,939 --> 01:00:07,399
She listened.

2187
01:00:07,816 --> 01:00:12,779
Unlike people who knew me for years
and ignored all the telltale signs.

2188
01:00:12,946 --> 01:00:15,699
-Like what?
-Like my obsession with Bette Midler.

2189
01:00:15,949 --> 01:00:17,743
My preference for track lighting.

2190
01:00:17,951 --> 01:00:20,746
And the fact that I like sucking dick.

2191
01:00:20,954 --> 01:00:23,332
What?! You've done that?!

2192
01:00:24,041 --> 01:00:27,961
Not with another guy, but remember
when I bought that book on yoga?

2193
01:00:28,170 --> 01:00:29,880
I don't want to hear anymore.

2194
01:00:30,088 --> 01:00:33,509
Look, you want to be gay?
Fine! No problem!

2195
01:00:33,717 --> 01:00:36,512
But from now on,
I'll take care of Judith myself.

2196
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:37,930
Okay!

2197
01:00:42,601 --> 01:00:45,020
-You want to be gay with me?
-No!

2198
01:00:50,150 --> 01:00:51,819
Come on, go, come on.

2199
01:00:52,027 --> 01:00:54,655
All you, all you! Eleven. Okay.

2200
01:00:54,863 --> 01:00:57,950
One more. One more.
Come on. One more.

2201
01:00:58,951 --> 01:01:00,869
Feel the burn. Come on, now.

2202
01:01:03,121 --> 01:01:04,331
Eleven.

2203
01:01:05,290 --> 01:01:06,542
What's the matter, dear?

2204
01:01:07,167 --> 01:01:11,004
You never used to be so winded
after only five sets.

2205
01:01:11,213 --> 01:01:13,549
Well, Mother Superior...

2206
01:01:14,383 --> 01:01:19,096
...I'm having some second thoughts
about becoming a nun.

2207
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:21,098
Oh, don't get me wrong.

2208
01:01:21,306 --> 01:01:24,518
This is a terrific convent. But I--

2209
01:01:24,726 --> 01:01:25,978
But....

2210
01:01:26,228 --> 01:01:27,229
Well...

2211
01:01:28,397 --> 01:01:31,775
...I'm having these feelings.

2212
01:01:31,984 --> 01:01:33,402
What kind of feelings?

2213
01:01:37,364 --> 01:01:39,366
You mean sexual feelings.

2214
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:43,453
Yeah, but it's so much more than that.

2215
01:01:43,662 --> 01:01:44,663
Yes, well...

2216
01:01:45,164 --> 01:01:46,582
...my dear...

2217
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:51,461
...you're the only one who can decide
if this is the life you want to live.

2218
01:01:51,670 --> 01:01:54,089
But once you take your final vows...

2219
01:01:55,382 --> 01:01:57,634
...there is no going back.

2220
01:01:58,510 --> 01:02:01,972
Now, let's go bust out
some power squats.

2221
01:02:16,195 --> 01:02:21,033
There. That should keep you
from escaping again. And this....

2222
01:02:23,202 --> 01:02:24,369
This....

2223
01:02:24,912 --> 01:02:26,872
This should keep you from biting.

2224
01:02:27,748 --> 01:02:30,459
-How am I gonna eat?
-I thought of that.

2225
01:02:31,710 --> 01:02:33,295
-What is that?
-It's breakfast.

2226
01:02:33,545 --> 01:02:36,590
It's pancakes, sausage,
hash brown, Pop Tart, puréed.

2227
01:02:36,798 --> 01:02:38,967
I won't eat it. I want a Big Montana.

2228
01:02:39,176 --> 01:02:41,512
A Big Montana from Arby's
with curly fries.

2229
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:46,016
I won't get you one. If you won't eat
what I made for you, you can starve!

2230
01:02:46,725 --> 01:02:48,519
Why are you doing this?!

2231
01:02:48,769 --> 01:02:50,604
To save our friendship.

2232
01:02:50,813 --> 01:02:53,774
Friendship? It seems like
you're in love with Darren.

2233
01:02:54,149 --> 01:02:55,442
Bullshit!

2234
01:02:55,651 --> 01:02:58,862
Just get over it.
Your buddy smokes pole and so do you.

2235
01:02:59,863 --> 01:03:01,532
I am so un-gay!

2236
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:05,536
Let's pretend you're straight.
When's the last time you got any?

2237
01:03:05,744 --> 01:03:07,079
None of your business.

2238
01:03:07,621 --> 01:03:08,705
So it's been years?

2239
01:03:09,414 --> 01:03:12,626
-I'm waiting for the right woman.
-There is no right woman.

2240
01:03:12,835 --> 01:03:17,297
If there was, you've already met
and she's killed herself or become gay.

2241
01:03:17,756 --> 01:03:19,550
-Bite me!
-Blow me!

2242
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:21,051
-Skank!
-Eunuch!

2243
01:03:21,552 --> 01:03:24,721
Stealer of my friend!

2244
01:03:32,437 --> 01:03:34,398
What happened to your head?

2245
01:03:38,026 --> 01:03:39,653
I saw Judith.

2246
01:03:40,154 --> 01:03:41,613
Judith's dead.

2247
01:03:41,822 --> 01:03:43,157
Yeah, but...

2248
01:03:43,407 --> 01:03:45,492
...I could've sworn it was her.

2249
01:03:45,701 --> 01:03:48,245
-I was on--
-You poor thing.

2250
01:03:48,453 --> 01:03:50,247
You're still not over her death.

2251
01:03:50,706 --> 01:03:53,292
Maybe we shouldn't be
seeing each other.

2252
01:03:54,001 --> 01:03:57,629
No. No. God, I'm fine.

2253
01:03:57,838 --> 01:04:00,507
And, look, I can deal
with this. Okay?

2254
01:04:04,678 --> 01:04:07,389
-So, what are you having?
-Let's see.

2255
01:04:07,598 --> 01:04:10,726
There's the duck.
That was always Judith's favorite.

2256
01:04:10,934 --> 01:04:12,478
-I'm sorry.
-I should leave.

2257
01:04:12,686 --> 01:04:14,771
No, you shouldn't. I'm so sorry.

2258
01:04:14,980 --> 01:04:18,275
I will never mention
Judith's name again, really.

2259
01:04:18,484 --> 01:04:20,277
I swear. I swear.

2260
01:04:23,197 --> 01:04:25,199
Would you excuse me for a moment?

2261
01:04:25,741 --> 01:04:29,036
Please. I'll be right back. Okay?

2262
01:04:29,244 --> 01:04:31,163
In a-- In a moment.

2263
01:04:37,503 --> 01:04:38,879
Damn it!

2264
01:04:42,883 --> 01:04:45,385
-What do you want?!
-Wayne, it's me, Darren.

2265
01:04:45,802 --> 01:04:50,015
I have a problem. I'm with Sandy,
but I can't stop talking about Judith.

2266
01:04:50,516 --> 01:04:52,810
Okay. I'll be right there.

2267
01:05:05,072 --> 01:05:07,032
Okay, open up your shirt.

2268
01:05:07,241 --> 01:05:08,951
-Why?
-Just do it.

2269
01:05:10,077 --> 01:05:11,787
What is this?

2270
01:05:13,914 --> 01:05:14,915
Now...

2271
01:05:15,582 --> 01:05:17,417
...here's what's gonna happen.

2272
01:05:19,378 --> 01:05:22,506
I'm going to listen
to your conversation.

2273
01:05:23,340 --> 01:05:24,424
Now...

2274
01:05:25,425 --> 01:05:28,595
...if you say anything about Judith...

2275
01:05:29,096 --> 01:05:31,682
...or so much as mention her name...

2276
01:05:31,890 --> 01:05:34,518
...then I'll give you a little shock.

2277
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:37,771
Perfect.

2278
01:05:39,523 --> 01:05:43,068
I don't think I'm comfortable
having these things on my nipples.

2279
01:05:43,277 --> 01:05:44,945
I could put them on your balls.

2280
01:05:45,279 --> 01:05:47,614
The nipples are fine. Nipples work.

2281
01:05:50,284 --> 01:05:54,079
Hi. Sorry, sorry, sorry.
I'm back. I am back.

2282
01:05:54,288 --> 01:05:57,791
There was a talkative
men's room attendant.

2283
01:05:58,125 --> 01:05:59,126
That's okay.

2284
01:06:13,223 --> 01:06:14,766
-Excuse me.
-Hey.

2285
01:06:14,975 --> 01:06:17,060
-This table's reserved.
-You know what?

2286
01:06:17,269 --> 01:06:20,063
I come here all the time,
and spend a lot of money...

2287
01:06:20,272 --> 01:06:22,441
...so why not leave me the hell alone?

2288
01:06:25,152 --> 01:06:27,237
I don't mean to be pushy...

2289
01:06:27,446 --> 01:06:30,157
...but if this relationship
is gonna get serious...

2290
01:06:30,365 --> 01:06:32,284
...I have to give up becoming a nun...

2291
01:06:32,659 --> 01:06:34,828
...and I'd have to decide soon...

2292
01:06:35,496 --> 01:06:37,664
...because my final vows
are on Sunday.

2293
01:06:38,248 --> 01:06:40,459
Yeah, that thought had occurred to me.

2294
01:06:40,667 --> 01:06:42,169
And if I do that...

2295
01:06:42,377 --> 01:06:46,507
...I need to know that
you want marriage and a family.

2296
01:06:47,674 --> 01:06:48,675
Absolutely.

2297
01:06:50,844 --> 01:06:54,681
I never thought I'd say this to anyone
after Luigi died, but...

2298
01:06:55,724 --> 01:06:57,267
...I love you, Darren.

2299
01:07:01,063 --> 01:07:02,481
I love you too, Judith.

2300
01:07:05,359 --> 01:07:07,653
-Judith?!
-I mean Sandy.

2301
01:07:07,820 --> 01:07:11,573
I mean, let's dance. Okay?

2302
01:07:20,290 --> 01:07:21,375
You're out of here.

2303
01:07:21,583 --> 01:07:24,127
Put me down! I haven't ordered yet!

2304
01:07:27,548 --> 01:07:30,092
Time for an attitude
adjustment, mister.

2305
01:07:33,387 --> 01:07:35,222
Hey, nice move.

2306
01:07:43,230 --> 01:07:44,314
Damn, he's good.

2307
01:07:46,191 --> 01:07:47,359
Darren!

2308
01:07:52,489 --> 01:07:53,448
Oh, my God!

2309
01:07:53,824 --> 01:07:56,076
Oh, jeez. Oh, my God!

2310
01:07:59,121 --> 01:08:01,165
Are you okay?

2311
01:08:02,749 --> 01:08:04,209
It was a little weird.

2312
01:08:17,306 --> 01:08:19,057
-What's going on?
-I can explain.

2313
01:08:19,433 --> 01:08:24,062
It's aversion therapy. Wayne was
trying to help me get over Judith...

2314
01:08:24,271 --> 01:08:26,482
...so I had these things-- Nipples--

2315
01:08:26,690 --> 01:08:30,068
Oh, my God.
It's so much worse than I thought.

2316
01:08:30,277 --> 01:08:33,780
No, you're obviously not ready
for this relationship.

2317
01:08:34,948 --> 01:08:36,867
No, I am! Sandy, wait!

2318
01:08:38,118 --> 01:08:39,286
Okay.

2319
01:08:39,495 --> 01:08:40,537
Damn it!

2320
01:08:43,624 --> 01:08:45,125
Wait, wait.

2321
01:08:46,919 --> 01:08:48,629
Wait, Sandy!

2322
01:09:01,809 --> 01:09:03,519
Oh, my God!

2323
01:09:03,727 --> 01:09:05,771
Darren. What happened to you?

2324
01:09:05,979 --> 01:09:08,482
-I ran here from the club.
-That's 30 miles!

2325
01:09:08,690 --> 01:09:11,401
Yeah, I know. I wanted to say...

2326
01:09:11,985 --> 01:09:15,113
...I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Can you ever forgive me?

2327
01:09:15,989 --> 01:09:18,951
Because the whole Judith thing
and the nipple clamps...

2328
01:09:19,159 --> 01:09:20,285
-...it's crazy, and--
-Yes!

2329
01:09:21,870 --> 01:09:23,121
-Really?
-Yes.

2330
01:09:23,497 --> 01:09:24,665
Just like that?

2331
01:09:24,873 --> 01:09:27,668
Well, I am training
to become a nun, you know.

2332
01:09:27,876 --> 01:09:29,920
Forgiveness is just sort of my thing.

2333
01:09:30,170 --> 01:09:31,296
I love you.

2334
01:09:31,505 --> 01:09:32,548
-Really?
-I love you.

2335
01:09:32,756 --> 01:09:35,259
-I love you.
-Oh, love. Love.

2336
01:09:53,110 --> 01:09:55,696
-Happy?
-You didn't have to do that.

2337
01:09:55,904 --> 01:10:00,367
I just happened to be by Arby's.
They were throwing out old food...

2338
01:10:00,576 --> 01:10:03,078
...so, you know, I thought, "Why not?"

2339
01:10:03,287 --> 01:10:06,165
Either way, that's nice of you.

2340
01:10:13,380 --> 01:10:15,007
I was wondering:

2341
01:10:16,550 --> 01:10:18,886
-Why Darren?
-What do you mean?

2342
01:10:19,344 --> 01:10:22,806
You don't seem the type to go
for a sensitive guy like Darren.

2343
01:10:23,015 --> 01:10:27,644
You seem more the kind of woman
that needs an assertive type of guy.

2344
01:10:33,859 --> 01:10:36,195
Before I met Darren, I was--

2345
01:10:38,739 --> 01:10:40,824
I was engaged to a guy like that.

2346
01:10:41,533 --> 01:10:45,662
His idea of fun was to fly to Thailand
to fight in a kickboxing tournament.

2347
01:10:46,413 --> 01:10:47,831
U.S.A.! Go, Josh!

2348
01:11:11,396 --> 01:11:13,774
After that,
I decided no more tough guys.

2349
01:11:14,691 --> 01:11:16,652
Yeah, and then you found Darren.

2350
01:11:16,860 --> 01:11:17,903
Yeah.

2351
01:11:18,362 --> 01:11:21,949
-So do you even love him?
-There's different types of love.

2352
01:11:22,866 --> 01:11:24,409
I knew it!

2353
01:11:24,618 --> 01:11:28,664
Sometimes you make rational decisions.
You can't always follow your heart.

2354
01:11:28,997 --> 01:11:30,123
Yeah, whatever.

2355
01:11:30,499 --> 01:11:34,211
I will admit there's something sexy
about a man who takes charge.

2356
01:11:34,753 --> 01:11:36,713
Like you kidnapping me.

2357
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:39,591
That took balls.

2358
01:11:40,217 --> 01:11:41,760
Big balls.

2359
01:11:42,970 --> 01:11:44,930
I gotta say it turned me on.

2360
01:11:46,598 --> 01:11:47,933
It did?

2361
01:12:27,389 --> 01:12:28,807
Oh, my God.

2362
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:36,482
Goddamn these chains!

2363
01:12:41,153 --> 01:12:42,488
Little key, little key.

2364
01:12:43,238 --> 01:12:45,365
What am I doing? I can't let you go!

2365
01:12:45,741 --> 01:12:48,285
Just give me one free hand.
It'll be worth it.

2366
01:12:49,870 --> 01:12:52,122
Okay. Give me the fries.

2367
01:13:01,590 --> 01:13:03,258
-Hi.
-Wow.

2368
01:13:03,467 --> 01:13:04,676
Hey.

2369
01:13:05,219 --> 01:13:06,470
Shit.

2370
01:13:09,473 --> 01:13:11,600
Just wait one minute, okay?

2371
01:13:15,896 --> 01:13:17,731
-Dude--
-Dude, you got a boner?

2372
01:13:18,023 --> 01:13:19,024
No.

2373
01:13:19,233 --> 01:13:21,318
-Why didn't you answer the door?
-I'm eating.

2374
01:13:21,527 --> 01:13:22,986
-So?
-I don't answer when I'm eating.

2375
01:13:23,195 --> 01:13:24,488
-Since when?
-Since always.

2376
01:13:24,696 --> 01:13:27,699
-I never knew that.
-You didn't know a lot, like I'm gay.

2377
01:13:28,033 --> 01:13:31,328
-Anything else you want to tell me?
-I got three balls.

2378
01:13:31,537 --> 01:13:34,373
Shut up! God!

2379
01:13:35,916 --> 01:13:36,959
Dude.

2380
01:13:38,210 --> 01:13:39,211
Hi, coach.

2381
01:13:39,419 --> 01:13:40,879
What are you doing here?

2382
01:13:41,088 --> 01:13:43,549
Retrial. Got a judge
that's a sports fan.

2383
01:13:44,007 --> 01:13:46,009
-Congrats.
-What will you do now?

2384
01:13:46,218 --> 01:13:50,264
That's why I'm here. Need a place
to crash, figure out my next move.

2385
01:13:50,472 --> 01:13:52,141
I knew I could count on you.

2386
01:13:52,349 --> 01:13:55,519
-Well, we gotta talk about--
-You stay as long as you like.

2387
01:13:55,811 --> 01:13:58,689
Great! Where's the bathroom?
I gotta take a dump.

2388
01:13:58,897 --> 01:14:02,943
We don't use the toilet anymore since
we're cutting down on the water bill.

2389
01:14:03,152 --> 01:14:04,278
What do you do?

2390
01:14:04,486 --> 01:14:07,114
Well, we just use the lawn now.

2391
01:14:07,531 --> 01:14:09,199
Smart thinking.

2392
01:14:09,575 --> 01:14:10,576
Oh, God!

2393
01:14:10,951 --> 01:14:13,954
You pinch loaves on the lawn?
I play croquet out there.

2394
01:14:14,163 --> 01:14:16,498
Are you crazy? Coach can't stay here!

2395
01:14:16,707 --> 01:14:19,793
-We got a woman locked in the garage!
-Oh, yeah!

2396
01:14:24,756 --> 01:14:26,425
You boys got any T.P.?

2397
01:14:26,633 --> 01:14:27,968
No!

2398
01:14:28,260 --> 01:14:30,304
That's all right.
I'll find something.

2399
01:14:36,143 --> 01:14:39,104
Play it cool. We'll find
some way to get rid of him.

2400
01:14:39,313 --> 01:14:43,400
We tell him we got dates. He can't
be here because we're getting laid.

2401
01:14:43,609 --> 01:14:45,736
No, he'll never believe that.

2402
01:14:45,944 --> 01:14:47,779
We'll tell him we got ghosts.

2403
01:14:47,988 --> 01:14:50,115
So, boys, what's for supper?

2404
01:14:50,324 --> 01:14:52,826
-Listen, coach--
-We have ghosts.

2405
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:57,164
We were thinking that maybe you
staying here's not such a great idea.

2406
01:14:57,372 --> 01:15:01,460
Nonsense. It'll give us a chance
to get to know one another again.

2407
01:15:01,668 --> 01:15:06,298
So you boys take care of that bitch
that was gonna marry Silverman?

2408
01:15:06,507 --> 01:15:10,177
Yeah, we snuffed that bitch
just like you said.

2409
01:15:10,677 --> 01:15:12,596
Good. How'd you do it?

2410
01:15:13,472 --> 01:15:14,473
-We--
-Ate her.

2411
01:15:15,098 --> 01:15:16,099
You ate her?

2412
01:15:16,350 --> 01:15:19,228
-Yeah. We ate her.
-Alive.

2413
01:15:19,436 --> 01:15:20,771
My hat goes off to you.

2414
01:15:20,979 --> 01:15:23,857
You boys are smart.
That's the perfect crime.

2415
01:15:24,942 --> 01:15:27,069
Wonder what's on the tube.

2416
01:15:27,361 --> 01:15:28,612
-No! Coach!
-No!

2417
01:15:29,863 --> 01:15:33,450
What the hell we got here?
Some kind of public access show?

2418
01:15:34,451 --> 01:15:36,578
That's the kidnap victim, ain't it?

2419
01:15:36,787 --> 01:15:37,955
You didn't kill her!

2420
01:15:38,163 --> 01:15:39,790
No. Coach, listen....

2421
01:15:39,998 --> 01:15:43,043
I am really disappointed in you boys.

2422
01:15:43,252 --> 01:15:45,879
I want you to go out there
and off that cooze.

2423
01:15:46,088 --> 01:15:47,464
We can't, coach.

2424
01:15:47,673 --> 01:15:50,300
Oh, for Pete's sakes!
Look! She's getting out!

2425
01:15:50,843 --> 01:15:53,262
Go chop her head off or something.

2426
01:15:54,304 --> 01:15:58,809
There's no fight left in you boys.
You're nutless. You been pussified.

2427
01:15:59,309 --> 01:16:02,980
Don't worry about a thing, boys.
I'll take care of that broad.

2428
01:16:09,486 --> 01:16:11,113
-Don't worry!
-Who are you?

2429
01:16:11,363 --> 01:16:14,783
Let's say I'm a friend of the boys,
and I'm here to kill you.

2430
01:16:15,033 --> 01:16:17,786
You don't mind if I try
to defend myself, do you?

2431
01:16:17,995 --> 01:16:20,873
Of course not.
I love a good challenge.

2432
01:16:41,518 --> 01:16:42,853
Are you okay?

2433
01:16:49,651 --> 01:16:50,694
Dude--

2434
01:16:58,452 --> 01:16:59,453
Got it?

2435
01:17:03,582 --> 01:17:06,376
-I'm so happy.
-Oh, me too.

2436
01:17:09,296 --> 01:17:11,089
Does this couch fold out?

2437
01:17:22,309 --> 01:17:24,603
What the hell is going on here?

2438
01:17:26,146 --> 01:17:27,231
-Judith!
-Yes.

2439
01:17:27,439 --> 01:17:28,899
-You're alive.
-Yes.

2440
01:17:29,107 --> 01:17:31,610
-Judith?
-Who is this tramp?

2441
01:17:31,819 --> 01:17:33,070
I'm not a tramp.

2442
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:36,615
Actually, until yesterday,
I was training to become a nun.

2443
01:17:37,032 --> 01:17:39,743
I'm gone for a week,
and you're screwing a nun?

2444
01:17:39,952 --> 01:17:42,579
No, no. We're in love.

2445
01:17:43,121 --> 01:17:44,456
I thought you were dead.

2446
01:17:44,832 --> 01:17:48,126
Oh, really? Well, I'm not dead.
I was kidnapped, okay?

2447
01:17:48,335 --> 01:17:50,337
It was hell!
I was beaten, tortured...

2448
01:17:50,546 --> 01:17:53,590
...and treated like
a frigging farm animal!

2449
01:17:53,799 --> 01:17:55,092
And the entire time...

2450
01:17:55,300 --> 01:17:58,303
...the only thing that kept
me alive was the thought...

2451
01:17:58,804 --> 01:18:02,474
...that somewhere out there,
my sweet Darren still loved me...

2452
01:18:02,683 --> 01:18:05,144
...and that one day
we'd be together again.

2453
01:18:07,771 --> 01:18:09,064
It was so horrible.

2454
01:18:17,573 --> 01:18:21,660
-Where are we going?
-I don't know. We gotta find her.

2455
01:18:22,369 --> 01:18:24,204
-Okay, where to?
-Go left!

2456
01:18:24,413 --> 01:18:25,998
I'm going right!

2457
01:18:26,665 --> 01:18:28,959
They kept me in
a dark closet for days.

2458
01:18:29,209 --> 01:18:34,089
And they fed me, like,
crushed potato chips under the door.

2459
01:18:37,050 --> 01:18:40,471
Maybe I should go.

2460
01:18:40,679 --> 01:18:42,055
Oh, no.

2461
01:18:44,683 --> 01:18:46,602
Please. Please, don't.

2462
01:18:46,810 --> 01:18:48,770
Don't leave.

2463
01:18:48,979 --> 01:18:50,272
Well, but, I mean...

2464
01:18:50,481 --> 01:18:54,693
...Judith's alive,
and she is your fiancée.

2465
01:18:56,278 --> 01:18:59,656
I know. You're right.
You're right. But....

2466
01:19:00,032 --> 01:19:02,117
But you can't go because I....

2467
01:19:02,576 --> 01:19:05,454
-Because what? Why, Darren?
-Because I--

2468
01:19:05,996 --> 01:19:07,581
-See, you--
-Yeah?

2469
01:19:07,789 --> 01:19:09,249
-Well, we-- And--
-Yeah?

2470
01:19:09,416 --> 01:19:12,336
Sweetheart, we pledged
our love to one another.

2471
01:19:12,544 --> 01:19:15,172
Spare her the pain
of seeing us together.

2472
01:19:15,380 --> 01:19:16,548
You...

2473
01:19:16,798 --> 01:19:18,884
...run along back to the nunnery.

2474
01:19:24,223 --> 01:19:25,224
She's right.

2475
01:19:25,641 --> 01:19:26,975
I mean...

2476
01:19:27,309 --> 01:19:29,520
...I did pledge.

2477
01:19:31,688 --> 01:19:33,065
Okay.

2478
01:19:36,109 --> 01:19:37,194
Bye.

2479
01:19:40,113 --> 01:19:41,490
She's here! Hey, Darren.

2480
01:19:41,698 --> 01:19:44,910
Sandy, hi. Look, I can--
Darren. Sorry.

2481
01:19:45,118 --> 01:19:48,664
Darren, look. I understand
that you're really upset.

2482
01:19:48,872 --> 01:19:51,375
I probably look like
a really big asshole--

2483
01:19:51,583 --> 01:19:52,918
Dude!

2484
01:19:54,419 --> 01:19:58,882
Okay. I deserved that.
But now let me explain--

2485
01:20:03,929 --> 01:20:08,350
Okay, I guess I deserved that one too,
but now we're even, okay?

2486
01:20:12,938 --> 01:20:16,775
Stop! We only did it
because we love you.

2487
01:20:16,942 --> 01:20:18,819
Oh, right, because you love me.

2488
01:20:19,027 --> 01:20:22,114
Yeah, man. Come on.
Give me a hug. It's--

2489
01:20:35,502 --> 01:20:39,631
-Freeze!
-Get your hands up!

2490
01:20:49,475 --> 01:20:52,352
Don't think my presence here
means I forgive you.

2491
01:20:52,561 --> 01:20:55,397
I just wanted to tell
you guys in person.

2492
01:20:55,606 --> 01:20:58,108
Judith and I are
getting married tomorrow.

2493
01:20:58,317 --> 01:21:00,944
You don't want to marry Judith.
Admit it.

2494
01:21:01,278 --> 01:21:03,947
-Of course I do.
-Okay.

2495
01:21:04,406 --> 01:21:06,658
Then look into my eyes and say it.

2496
01:21:07,117 --> 01:21:09,077
I want to marry Judith.

2497
01:21:09,411 --> 01:21:12,956
Look into both our eyes
at the same time and say it.

2498
01:21:13,499 --> 01:21:15,042
I'm out of here.

2499
01:21:16,460 --> 01:21:19,796
Come on. We're sorry, okay?

2500
01:21:20,130 --> 01:21:22,049
What we did was wrong.

2501
01:21:25,719 --> 01:21:27,221
We gotta stop that wedding.

2502
01:21:27,429 --> 01:21:29,223
Dude, how?

2503
01:21:30,516 --> 01:21:35,103
Let's go, you maggots!
Kill! Kill! Kill!

2504
01:21:37,606 --> 01:21:41,109
Coach. Yeah, it's Wayne and J.D.
Look, we need your help.

2505
01:21:41,318 --> 01:21:44,530
I'd do anything for you boys.
Name it, you got it.

2506
01:21:44,738 --> 01:21:49,326
Well, we need you to post bail for us.
It's $10,000 apiece.

2507
01:21:49,535 --> 01:21:52,538
-No way!
-Come on, coach.

2508
01:21:52,746 --> 01:21:54,039
We need your help.

2509
01:21:54,289 --> 01:21:56,834
Jail life is real tough. They're--

2510
01:21:57,084 --> 01:21:59,628
They're sodomizing us in here.

2511
01:21:59,837 --> 01:22:02,172
What?! They're corn-holing you?

2512
01:22:02,381 --> 01:22:06,510
Oh, my God. That's horrible.
Don't worry. I'll get you out.

2513
01:22:07,678 --> 01:22:11,473
You got sodomized?
Who? I want to meet him.

2514
01:22:13,892 --> 01:22:14,893
What is that?

2515
01:22:15,060 --> 01:22:17,062
Sounds kind of like my truck.

2516
01:22:23,902 --> 01:22:25,237
Come on, boys. Let's go.

2517
01:22:26,572 --> 01:22:28,532
Get the lead out, boys! Hut, hut!

2518
01:22:29,491 --> 01:22:31,034
Come on, move it!

2519
01:22:31,827 --> 01:22:35,038
You're free. Now, where to, boys?

2520
01:22:35,330 --> 01:22:36,582
Go left.

2521
01:22:38,750 --> 01:22:40,085
Charge!

2522
01:22:42,713 --> 01:22:44,673
Sandy Perkus...

2523
01:22:45,007 --> 01:22:47,759
...do you vow to lead
a life of poverty...

2524
01:22:47,968 --> 01:22:49,845
...chastity, obedience...

2525
01:22:50,053 --> 01:22:51,722
...and silence?

2526
01:22:52,389 --> 01:22:53,849
Wait!

2527
01:22:55,017 --> 01:22:56,018
Sorry.

2528
01:22:57,853 --> 01:22:59,354
Look, you can't do this.

2529
01:22:59,605 --> 01:23:01,940
-You love Darren, right?
-Well, yeah.

2530
01:23:02,191 --> 01:23:04,359
-Well, Darren loves you.
-Really?

2531
01:23:04,610 --> 01:23:07,654
Darren's her boyfriend,
but he has this other girlfriend...

2532
01:23:07,863 --> 01:23:10,866
-...and he's getting--
-So, what are you gonna do?

2533
01:23:12,701 --> 01:23:14,453
Go, my child.

2534
01:23:15,037 --> 01:23:16,121
-Okay.
-Come on.

2535
01:23:16,371 --> 01:23:18,415
We've got a wedding to crash!

2536
01:23:18,624 --> 01:23:20,459
Go. Go. Go.

2537
01:23:20,709 --> 01:23:21,710
Bye, everybody!

2538
01:23:22,878 --> 01:23:25,088
Damn. Lost another one.

2539
01:23:25,297 --> 01:23:27,216
Son of a bitch.

2540
01:23:41,939 --> 01:23:43,941
I can't believe I'm doing this.

2541
01:23:44,149 --> 01:23:46,819
Oh, here. We got you some clothes.

2542
01:23:48,403 --> 01:23:50,364
Where did you get these?

2543
01:23:50,572 --> 01:23:51,615
J.D.'s sister.

2544
01:23:51,824 --> 01:23:54,409
-She's a stripper.
-And a hooker.

2545
01:24:12,010 --> 01:24:13,178
Go! Gotta go!

2546
01:24:18,183 --> 01:24:19,309
Oh, my gosh!

2547
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:21,019
Neil Diamond!

2548
01:24:21,270 --> 01:24:22,729
What the hell is going on?

2549
01:24:22,938 --> 01:24:24,189
Neil, let me explain.

2550
01:24:24,398 --> 01:24:28,569
You're the guys who send me all those
letters and tapes. Naked pictures.

2551
01:24:28,777 --> 01:24:32,322
What? We never sent you
any naked pictures.

2552
01:24:32,698 --> 01:24:33,907
-Dude.
-Sorry.

2553
01:24:34,116 --> 01:24:36,910
Mr. Diamond, you gotta
help us save our buddy.

2554
01:24:37,119 --> 01:24:38,745
He's marrying the wrong woman.

2555
01:24:38,954 --> 01:24:41,165
Sandy and Darren, they broke up.

2556
01:24:41,373 --> 01:24:43,625
Love on the rocks.
Ain't no big surprise.

2557
01:24:43,834 --> 01:24:47,212
-Help us get them back together.
-I don't know.

2558
01:24:47,421 --> 01:24:50,299
Turn on your heart light.
Judith brainwashed him.

2559
01:24:50,507 --> 01:24:53,218
For years, Darren loved me,
but I never knew it.

2560
01:24:53,427 --> 01:24:54,887
Hold it. Hold it!

2561
01:24:55,721 --> 01:24:58,182
-Hold on.
-And did I mention I was gay?

2562
01:24:58,390 --> 01:25:01,685
I've spent my life writing songs
about the power of love...

2563
01:25:01,894 --> 01:25:04,730
...but up until right now,
they've only been words.

2564
01:25:04,980 --> 01:25:08,901
This may be my chance to prove that
those words really mean something.

2565
01:25:09,109 --> 01:25:12,196
-You say that if Darren marries...
-Judith.

2566
01:25:12,404 --> 01:25:14,907
-...Judith, he'll be miserable.
-Right.

2567
01:25:15,115 --> 01:25:19,119
I believe in happy endings. If Neil
Diamond has anything to do with it...

2568
01:25:19,328 --> 01:25:21,121
...this love story will have one.

2569
01:25:21,330 --> 01:25:23,373
Come on! Yeah!

2570
01:25:23,749 --> 01:25:26,627
We got Neil Diamond onboard!
All right!

2571
01:25:26,835 --> 01:25:29,588
-Where we going?
-The park on America Avenue.

2572
01:25:30,589 --> 01:25:32,424
-5-0!
-What?

2573
01:25:32,591 --> 01:25:33,759
Cops. Caprice.

2574
01:25:34,009 --> 01:25:36,220
Five cars back. Goddamn heat.

2575
01:25:36,470 --> 01:25:39,348
One little prison break,
and they're all over you.

2576
01:25:40,349 --> 01:25:41,600
Whoa, coach.

2577
01:25:42,184 --> 01:25:44,436
No matter what happens,
don't look back.

2578
01:25:44,603 --> 01:25:47,523
Just get this sweet gal
to the man who loves her.

2579
01:25:47,731 --> 01:25:51,693
I'd rather be cut down in a hail
of gunfire than to go back to jail.

2580
01:25:52,110 --> 01:25:54,279
Nice meeting you, Mr. Diamond.

2581
01:26:02,704 --> 01:26:03,872
Coach, look out!

2582
01:26:07,125 --> 01:26:08,252
They're not cops!

2583
01:26:13,715 --> 01:26:16,135
Hey, we're coming to America.

2584
01:26:21,265 --> 01:26:25,477
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here
today to join Darren Silverman...

2585
01:26:25,644 --> 01:26:28,981
...and Judith Fessbeggler
in holy matrimony.

2586
01:26:29,314 --> 01:26:32,234
If anyone has any objections,
speak now.

2587
01:26:32,484 --> 01:26:33,569
I do.

2588
01:26:33,777 --> 01:26:35,779
-What?
-Neil?

2589
01:26:41,410 --> 01:26:42,744
-Neil!
-Neil.

2590
01:26:42,953 --> 01:26:45,330
Get to the part where we say, "I do."

2591
01:27:08,353 --> 01:27:09,354
Oh, my!

2592
01:27:10,189 --> 01:27:12,024
-Say, "I do."
-No.

2593
01:27:12,441 --> 01:27:14,109
Say, "I do."

2594
01:27:14,359 --> 01:27:16,195
I can't. Because I...

2595
01:27:19,531 --> 01:27:21,492
...I love Neil...

2596
01:27:21,700 --> 01:27:23,535
...and I love Sandy.

2597
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:26,788
You're in love with this slut?

2598
01:27:26,997 --> 01:27:29,124
I am not a slut.

2599
01:27:29,625 --> 01:27:31,960
Sandy is my one and only someone.

2600
01:27:45,557 --> 01:27:47,017
What about me?

2601
01:27:47,559 --> 01:27:50,145
Who's my someone?

2602
01:28:07,871 --> 01:28:09,748
You ruined my life!

2603
01:28:11,083 --> 01:28:12,543
But I saved Darren's!

2604
01:28:12,751 --> 01:28:15,921
Just because I lost Darren
doesn't mean I'm crazy enough...

2605
01:28:16,213 --> 01:28:17,589
...to hook up with you!

2606
01:28:23,387 --> 01:28:26,807
Why can't you just admit that
when you kissed me, you liked it?

2607
01:28:27,015 --> 01:28:30,102
You're right. I have a weakness
for incompetent morons.

2608
01:28:39,194 --> 01:28:40,779
Admit it!

2609
01:28:42,072 --> 01:28:45,367
I'm the strong-willed,
assertive man that you need...

2610
01:28:45,576 --> 01:28:49,538
...and you're the hard-core bitch
that I've always dreamed of.

2611
01:29:09,892 --> 01:29:10,893
What about you?

2612
01:29:11,727 --> 01:29:15,230
-When are you gonna get hitched?
-Actually, I'm not. I'm gay.

2613
01:29:16,398 --> 01:29:17,649
Me too.

2614
01:29:17,900 --> 01:29:19,109
Really?

2615
01:29:19,860 --> 01:29:22,654
By the power vested in me
by the state of Washington...

2616
01:29:22,863 --> 01:29:25,532
...I now pronounce you man and wife.

2617
01:29:25,741 --> 01:29:27,409
You may kiss the bride.

2618
01:29:30,245 --> 01:29:32,873
I now pronounce you man and wife.

2619
01:29:33,081 --> 01:29:35,000
You may kiss the bride.

2620
01:29:37,711 --> 01:29:41,215
I now pronounce you man and man.

2621
01:29:41,423 --> 01:29:43,342
You may kiss the man.

2622
01:30:05,447 --> 01:30:07,449
Come on, we need you for this one.
