00:00:26,293 --> 00:00:31,845
Since the dawn of man, the vampires
have walked among us, killing, feeding.

2
00:00:31,933 --> 00:00:36,882
The only one with the strength or skill
to stop their heinous evil is the Slayer,

3
00:00:36,973 --> 00:00:40,443
she who bears the birthmark,
the mark of the coven.

4
00:00:40,533 --> 00:00:45,971
Trained by the Watcher,
one slayer dies and the next is chosen.

5
00:00:47,053 --> 00:00:49,169
And I shall be his sword.

6
00:00:49,253 --> 00:00:51,244
Let Satan tremble.

7
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:54,086
The Slayer is born.

8
00:02:34,293 --> 00:02:38,286
OK, people. They're psyching you out.
Let's not be so defensive out there.

9
00:02:38,373 --> 00:02:43,606
What do we say on the court? Repeat after
me. "I am a person. I have a right to the ball."

10
00:02:43,693 --> 00:02:47,686
Good. Now, here's our key play.
We're gonna... Are we the Xs or the Os?

11
00:02:47,773 --> 00:02:50,367
- We're the Os.
- Right. OK.

12
00:03:38,853 --> 00:03:40,844
Mr Howard is so heinous.

13
00:03:42,253 --> 00:03:44,289
He's always giving me a hard time.

14
00:03:44,373 --> 00:03:48,207
I get a C plus on the test, and he tells me
"You have no sense of history."

15
00:03:48,293 --> 00:03:51,524
I have no sense of history?
He wears a brown tie.

16
00:03:51,613 --> 00:03:55,526
You got a C plus?
I can't believe I cheated off of you.

17
00:03:55,613 --> 00:03:58,286
Excuse me for
not knowing about El Salvador.

18
00:03:58,373 --> 00:04:00,603
Like I'm ever going to Spain anyway.

19
00:04:02,573 --> 00:04:04,564
Look at that jacket.

20
00:04:07,453 --> 00:04:09,444
This is so lush.

21
00:04:10,213 --> 00:04:14,684
- Wouldn't you guys just love me in this?
- Guys, what's the sitch? I'm bored.

22
00:04:14,773 --> 00:04:18,925
- What do you think?
- Please. It's so five minutes ago.

23
00:04:19,013 --> 00:04:20,002
Yeah.

24
00:04:23,133 --> 00:04:24,361
What are we doing?

25
00:04:24,453 --> 00:04:26,603
- Why don't we go see a movie?
- Where?

26
00:04:26,693 --> 00:04:28,888
- Omniplex?
- Nee sitch. No way.

27
00:04:28,973 --> 00:04:31,123
- No THX.
- They don't even have Dolby.

28
00:04:31,253 --> 00:04:32,527
- Sorry.
- Beverly Center.

29
00:04:32,613 --> 00:04:35,366
- They show previews for foreign movies.
- Oh, yeah.

30
00:04:35,453 --> 00:04:37,523
- AMC?
- Bogus corn.

31
00:04:37,613 --> 00:04:41,049
Totally stale. And the ushers are,
like, the acne patrol. Totally.

32
00:04:41,133 --> 00:04:46,002
OK. OK. How about...
We're thinking Pavilion? Sitch solved?

33
00:04:46,093 --> 00:04:49,369
- Sounds toasty.
- Excellent. What's playing there?

34
00:04:49,453 --> 00:04:51,683
I don't know. Does it matter?

35
00:04:51,973 --> 00:04:55,852
- Excuse much. Rude or anything?
- Nice ensemble.

36
00:04:56,173 --> 00:04:58,846
What a homeless.

37
00:05:08,213 --> 00:05:10,647
Is Jeffrey really
spending the night at your house?

38
00:05:10,733 --> 00:05:13,611
- That's the plan.
- What a sitch.

39
00:05:13,693 --> 00:05:17,003
Your parents are always away. You're lucky.

40
00:05:17,093 --> 00:05:19,243
- I guess.
- Mine don't. I'll die a virgin.

41
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:22,086
You guys shut up, please.

42
00:05:22,173 --> 00:05:24,607
It could happen.

43
00:05:24,693 --> 00:05:26,684
God, what a 'tude.

44
00:05:28,853 --> 00:05:30,844
It's the Loch Ness monster.

45
00:05:31,693 --> 00:05:34,207
God, take a chill lozenge.

46
00:05:34,293 --> 00:05:36,363
- Like we don't have rights too.
- Yeah.

47
00:05:36,453 --> 00:05:38,444
Ignore them, OK? lgnore them.

48
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:43,325
Oh, no, no. I can't believe these people.
We paid good money to see this.

49
00:05:43,413 --> 00:05:46,450
- No, we didn't.
- Oh, yeah.

50
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:57,202
Look at the street. They're all
lining up for me because I am the champ!

51
00:05:58,253 --> 00:06:00,687
Look at the moon, man. It's a huge moon.

52
00:06:00,773 --> 00:06:03,333
Guys, tonight we gotta go out and party.

53
00:06:03,413 --> 00:06:07,167
If you spent more time sleeping,
you'd spend less time on the court sucking.

54
00:06:07,253 --> 00:06:10,006
You were a bonehead out there yesterday.

55
00:06:10,093 --> 00:06:14,609
Anyway, I'm booked. Gotta spend
some quality time with the little lady.

56
00:06:14,813 --> 00:06:18,647
- Pushover. You're such a pushover.
- You guys are pathetic.

57
00:06:18,733 --> 00:06:22,169
- I'm blowing. Andy, you coming?
- I'll catch a ride with Jeffrey.

58
00:06:22,253 --> 00:06:24,813
- Later.
- Slam dunk.

59
00:06:24,893 --> 00:06:26,884
Later.

60
00:06:41,213 --> 00:06:44,808
Jeffrey, I don't wanna sound sexist
or anything, but can I borrow her?

61
00:06:44,893 --> 00:06:46,804
- Andy.
- No way.

62
00:06:46,893 --> 00:06:49,885
You'd get her dirty.
He would, honey. He's an animal.

63
00:06:49,973 --> 00:06:53,283
- See you at my house.
- Don't look.

64
00:07:13,013 --> 00:07:15,129
Oh, man.

65
00:07:15,213 --> 00:07:17,602
I'm not in the mood for this.

66
00:07:17,693 --> 00:07:21,288
OK, whoever's behind me
better be gone when I turn around.

67
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:26,646
What are you? Are you some kind
of weirdo or somethin'? Huh?

68
00:07:31,933 --> 00:07:34,652
The cause of death was
a neck wound that resembled,

69
00:07:34,733 --> 00:07:38,248
in the words of one bystander,
"a really gross hickey".

70
00:07:38,693 --> 00:07:44,484
In a related story, the body of the third slasher
victim has disappearedfrom the morgue.

71
00:07:44,573 --> 00:07:47,565
- There it is.
- Have fun. Be good. Stay away from the Jag.

72
00:07:47,653 --> 00:07:49,928
I know.

73
00:07:50,013 --> 00:07:52,652
- That's everything.
- Bye.

74
00:07:52,733 --> 00:07:54,803
Kiss noise. Bye-bye, Bobby.

75
00:07:54,893 --> 00:07:58,329
- Bye.
- ...victim was found today, the fourth.

76
00:07:58,413 --> 00:08:02,247
And Lulu just can't get pregnant.

77
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:06,770
- She thinks my name is Bobby?
- It's possible she thinks my name's Bobby.

78
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:09,083
Real quality-timer, huh?

79
00:08:10,813 --> 00:08:12,804
Something like that.

80
00:08:14,013 --> 00:08:16,163
Hey, it works for me.

81
00:08:16,253 --> 00:08:20,690
I mean, if they wanna leave you alone
in the house, all helpless and vulnerable...

82
00:08:20,773 --> 00:08:25,324
The weather hasn't disappointed us. Constant
sun and temperatures in the high 70s

83
00:08:25,413 --> 00:08:28,405
have made every winter's day a beach day.

84
00:09:01,053 --> 00:09:04,807
Oh, please. Show me a real slayer.

85
00:09:04,893 --> 00:09:08,283
- Lothos.
- Will you people ever learn?

86
00:09:08,373 --> 00:09:10,364
We can't be stopped.

87
00:09:16,253 --> 00:09:18,642
This is our world now.

88
00:09:39,893 --> 00:09:44,603
Sleep, my master, my own. Sleep.

89
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:48,330
I have already begun
building you a new family.

90
00:09:48,413 --> 00:09:54,045
Soon we will be legion. When you rise,
we will claim this place as our own.

91
00:09:54,133 --> 00:09:56,886
Rubies will drip from your lips.

92
00:10:05,933 --> 00:10:07,207
Soon.

93
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:12,893
The environment. I tell you, it's totally key.
The earth is in terrible shape. We could die.

94
00:10:12,973 --> 00:10:15,407
- Sting's doing it.
- I thought he was doing Indians.

95
00:10:15,493 --> 00:10:18,246
- How about the homelesses?
- Move.

96
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:21,291
Aren't there any sicknesses
that aren't too depressing?

97
00:10:21,373 --> 00:10:23,728
- Hi.
- What you guys doin'?

98
00:10:24,133 --> 00:10:28,524
- Senior dance. We need a theme.
- It has to be a socially conscious theme.

99
00:10:28,613 --> 00:10:31,844
One that reflects the students'
growing awareness of

100
00:10:31,933 --> 00:10:34,447
and involvement in the world around them.

101
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:36,524
Downer.

102
00:10:36,613 --> 00:10:39,207
I still say the environment.
That's my suggestion.

103
00:10:39,293 --> 00:10:41,682
- Yeah, me too.
- Yes. It's gonna work.

104
00:10:41,773 --> 00:10:45,846
What are the most immediate threats
to the world environment right now?

105
00:10:47,493 --> 00:10:48,289
Litter?

106
00:10:48,373 --> 00:10:50,933
- Litter, yeah.
- Forest fires?

107
00:10:51,413 --> 00:10:53,881
- Bugs?
- Bugs, totally.

108
00:10:53,973 --> 00:10:55,964
- Yeah. I hate bugs.
- Yeah.

109
00:10:56,053 --> 00:10:58,408
- Cassandra, write it down.
- OK, guys.

110
00:10:58,493 --> 00:11:01,246
What do you think about the ozone layer?

111
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:03,324
Yeah.

112
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:08,533
- Yeah. We gotta get rid of that.
- First bell, people. Time marches on.

113
00:11:08,613 --> 00:11:11,127
- What's your point?
- Button it, Kramer.

114
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:14,205
Let's meet tonight, OK? Café Blasé?

115
00:11:14,293 --> 00:11:17,251
- Cool. We can figure decorations and stuff.
- Yeah.

116
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:22,088
I don't know, guys. I really wanna
get a head start on my homework.

117
00:11:22,173 --> 00:11:24,971
Oh, yeah. I love that one.

118
00:11:28,933 --> 00:11:32,846
Buff, I don't see why
we have to invite every single senior.

119
00:11:33,133 --> 00:11:36,967
Because it's the senior dance.
It's just a shot in the dark.

120
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:41,770
So? I mean, like, why do we have
to invite Nadia? She's such a blemish.

121
00:11:41,853 --> 00:11:44,083
I know, you're right. She is.

122
00:11:44,173 --> 00:11:46,164
Hi.

123
00:11:48,253 --> 00:11:51,484
- What?
- I thought that look was over.

124
00:11:52,053 --> 00:11:54,886
- Well, it's retro.
- Yeah, retro.

125
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:58,448
You can borrow it sometime.

126
00:11:58,533 --> 00:12:02,970
OK. Maybe I will. We were talking about
the senior dance, if you're interested.

127
00:12:03,053 --> 00:12:05,328
You guys, look who's coming.

128
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,884
Sick!

129
00:12:13,493 --> 00:12:15,484
What does it look like?

130
00:12:18,773 --> 00:12:21,162
Two coffees or a hot dog.

131
00:12:21,653 --> 00:12:24,531
- Nothing on it and nothing on the side.
- Losers.

132
00:12:24,613 --> 00:12:28,003
- I'm Charlotte. I'll be your waitress.
- Hi, Charlotte.

133
00:12:28,093 --> 00:12:31,563
- Say something, Buffy.
- You guys are thrashed.

134
00:12:31,853 --> 00:12:33,844
- Just a little.
- Are we?

135
00:12:35,853 --> 00:12:38,970
That would explain the slurred speech.

136
00:12:39,053 --> 00:12:41,328
Thanks. What's your name?

137
00:12:43,253 --> 00:12:46,450
- Buffy.
- Yeah, it figures.

138
00:12:49,173 --> 00:12:51,243
I'm Pike.

139
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:53,528
This is Benny.

140
00:12:55,773 --> 00:12:58,082
And I'm Pike.

141
00:12:58,613 --> 00:13:00,843
Pike isn't a name. It's a fish.

142
00:13:03,733 --> 00:13:06,884
- Don't we know you guys?
- Hey, wait a minute.

143
00:13:06,973 --> 00:13:09,407
You're the guys from the movie.

144
00:13:09,493 --> 00:13:11,529
We hate you guys.

145
00:13:11,853 --> 00:13:13,923
Like we care, I'm sure.

146
00:13:14,173 --> 00:13:16,164
Yeah.

147
00:13:17,493 --> 00:13:20,724
You guys were very rude, OK?
It was shocking.

148
00:13:20,813 --> 00:13:23,725
- Well, you just snuck in anyway.
- Yeah.

149
00:13:24,613 --> 00:13:27,491
Hey, Buffy. You hungry?
I got something for ya.

150
00:13:32,413 --> 00:13:34,881
Oh, man. She wasted my dog.

151
00:13:40,613 --> 00:13:44,162
I'll have it runnin' in a week.
All it needs is some brake pads.

152
00:13:44,253 --> 00:13:48,883
Shocks and tyres. A new engine, maybe.
It'll be totally cherry.

153
00:13:48,973 --> 00:13:52,329
When you get that car together,
let's bail. Get out of this town.

154
00:13:52,413 --> 00:13:55,166
Those rich bitches are a plague.
They gotta be stopped.

155
00:13:55,253 --> 00:13:57,289
You didn't like 'em? Give me that.

156
00:13:57,373 --> 00:14:00,683
I mean, they're all the same.
They're just so stuck-up.

157
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:03,810
Pike, they're not even human. I hate 'em.

158
00:14:03,893 --> 00:14:05,884
Yeah, but would you bone 'em?

159
00:14:05,973 --> 00:14:08,407
Yes, definitely. Please, God.

160
00:14:08,493 --> 00:14:12,008
Especially the blonde.
I'd give my right eye for a piece of that.

161
00:14:12,093 --> 00:14:14,402
She's not even human.

162
00:14:14,493 --> 00:14:17,451
Yes, but her yabos scoff at gravity.

163
00:14:17,533 --> 00:14:22,687
Man, you're disgusting. You don't even like
her and you'd sleep with her. What is that?

164
00:14:22,773 --> 00:14:26,004
I got news. Another shot of this
and I'll have sex with you.

165
00:14:26,093 --> 00:14:28,891
Oh, yeah. Then you'll never call me.

166
00:14:35,693 --> 00:14:41,290
- I think I'm gonna ralph.
- Hey, Benny, I'm here for you, man. I'm here.

167
00:14:42,653 --> 00:14:44,644
I'm here for you, Ralph.

168
00:14:49,213 --> 00:14:51,204
Oh, man.

169
00:15:08,293 --> 00:15:11,410
This is not a very safe place
for you to fall asleep.

170
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:13,609
OK, Mom.

171
00:15:17,893 --> 00:15:21,283
OK. Dribble, shoot, shoot.

172
00:15:22,013 --> 00:15:25,005
Take that ball to the hoop, hoop.

173
00:15:25,093 --> 00:15:27,129
- Right. Yeah.
- It's cool. I like that.

174
00:15:27,213 --> 00:15:29,204
- Bye.
- Hey, you guys, I was thinking.

175
00:15:29,293 --> 00:15:34,686
For the senior dance, what if we made
a big sign that says "Don't Tread On Me"?

176
00:15:34,773 --> 00:15:36,968
You know? And a picture of the earth?

177
00:15:37,053 --> 00:15:41,365
How do you not tread on the earth?
I mean, you kind of have to, right?

178
00:15:42,413 --> 00:15:46,008
- Yeah, I never thought of that. Yeah.
- I gotta bail. You coming?

179
00:15:46,093 --> 00:15:51,929
No, you guys blow. I'm waiting on Cassandra.
She's gonna help me with my history. Wait.

180
00:15:52,013 --> 00:15:58,202
I kinda loaned her Kimberly's yellow
leather jacket, so don't tell her, all right?

181
00:15:58,493 --> 00:16:00,688
- OK. I won't. See ya.
- Bye.

182
00:16:15,013 --> 00:16:17,925
God! You scared me to death.

183
00:16:18,013 --> 00:16:23,007
- Where the hell'd you come from?
- That was very impressive. The tumbling.

184
00:16:23,093 --> 00:16:25,084
What?

185
00:16:25,933 --> 00:16:29,846
I used to do gymnastics.
Are you looking for somebody?

186
00:16:30,253 --> 00:16:32,972
I was looking for you, actually.

187
00:16:33,053 --> 00:16:36,523
Why? Am I in trouble or something?
Cos if I am, I didn't do it.

188
00:16:37,813 --> 00:16:41,601
You're not in trouble, I am.
I'm years late. You should have been taught.

189
00:16:41,693 --> 00:16:45,163
But I wasn't certain
until just now that it was you.

190
00:16:45,253 --> 00:16:49,883
- What are you talking about?
- I've searched everywhere for you, Buffy.

191
00:16:51,413 --> 00:16:54,928
- Why?
- To bring you your birthright.

192
00:16:55,013 --> 00:16:59,086
My birthright?
Is that, like, a trust fund or something?

193
00:16:59,573 --> 00:17:05,603
I think it'll be easier for you to understand
this birthright if I show it to you.

194
00:17:06,093 --> 00:17:10,962
All right? So you come
with me now to the graveyard.

195
00:17:13,253 --> 00:17:15,721
No, no, no, no.

196
00:17:15,813 --> 00:17:18,486
My trust fund's in the graveyard?

197
00:17:18,573 --> 00:17:20,564
God, what's your damage?

198
00:17:21,453 --> 00:17:22,886
Buffy?

199
00:17:22,973 --> 00:17:28,605
You're one of those skanky old men that
attacks little girls, right? Well, forget you.

200
00:17:28,973 --> 00:17:32,522
My name is Merrick,
and you have been chosen, Buffy.

201
00:17:34,213 --> 00:17:39,003
Chosen to go to the graveyard? Why don't
you just take the first runner-up, OK?

202
00:17:39,093 --> 00:17:44,929
Everything depends on you, Buffy. You must
come to the graveyard while there's still time.

203
00:17:45,013 --> 00:17:48,722
- Time to do what?
- Time to stop the killing.

204
00:17:48,813 --> 00:17:54,365
- To stop the vampires.
- All right. Let me get this straight, OK?

205
00:17:54,453 --> 00:17:57,729
You want me to go to the graveyard with you

206
00:17:57,813 --> 00:18:01,488
because I'm the Chosen One
and there are vampires?

207
00:18:02,053 --> 00:18:03,725
Yes.

208
00:18:03,813 --> 00:18:06,008
Does Elvis talk to you?

209
00:18:06,093 --> 00:18:09,972
Does he tell you to do things?
Do you see spots?

210
00:18:10,453 --> 00:18:13,365
Spots? Yes, of course.

211
00:18:13,453 --> 00:18:16,684
That's your proof. Spots.

212
00:18:17,053 --> 00:18:21,012
You bear the mark.
You bear the mark of the coven.

213
00:18:21,093 --> 00:18:23,084
What? That big old hairy mole?

214
00:18:23,173 --> 00:18:25,164
Ew. I had that thing removed.

215
00:18:25,253 --> 00:18:28,848
You knowing about my big old mole
doesn't prove anything,

216
00:18:28,933 --> 00:18:32,562
except for it's way past
medication time for you, buddy.

217
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:36,282
- Why don't you just stay away from me?
- Ever dream you were someone else?

218
00:18:36,373 --> 00:18:39,012
- Everybody does.
- Someone in the past.

219
00:18:39,573 --> 00:18:43,612
Someone real.
A Magyar peasant girl, perhaps.

220
00:18:43,693 --> 00:18:45,763
An Indian princess?

221
00:18:45,853 --> 00:18:47,844
A slave?

222
00:18:51,133 --> 00:18:54,170
- I was a slave.
- In Virginia.

223
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:58,492
I don't know. There was, like,
this big farm or something.

224
00:19:00,693 --> 00:19:05,130
There was this one where
there were these knights, and I am a...

225
00:19:05,773 --> 00:19:08,287
A servant girl. A barmaid.

226
00:19:09,573 --> 00:19:11,564
Oh, my God.

227
00:19:12,733 --> 00:19:18,808
Oh, my God. I never told anybody about this.
There's one where there's this man.

228
00:19:18,893 --> 00:19:21,612
I think he's a man.
He's in my dreams sometimes.

229
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:24,002
I'm fighting him.

230
00:19:24,093 --> 00:19:28,086
Always fighting him. But he's so strong.

231
00:19:28,373 --> 00:19:30,364
His name is Lothos.

232
00:19:34,453 --> 00:19:36,728
How do you know all this?

233
00:19:36,813 --> 00:19:39,964
Because it is your birthright
and I am a part of it.

234
00:19:41,493 --> 00:19:46,851
You come with me to the graveyard,
and I will show you.

235
00:19:51,613 --> 00:19:56,767
I can't believe I'm doing this. I can't believe
I'm in a graveyard with a strange man,

236
00:19:56,853 --> 00:20:00,402
hunting for vampires on a school night.

237
00:20:02,373 --> 00:20:06,286
Why did you never
tell anyone about your dreams?

238
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:09,604
Right. Tell everybody I'm crazy. Beauty idea.

239
00:20:11,533 --> 00:20:15,128
- Cramps?
- None of your business. God.

240
00:20:15,213 --> 00:20:19,092
This is it.
Robert Barmen was killed three days ago.

241
00:20:19,173 --> 00:20:22,483
His body was found
in the bushes by the canal.

242
00:20:22,573 --> 00:20:25,326
Extensive tissue damage.

243
00:20:25,413 --> 00:20:28,405
Tearing at the neck and shoulders.

244
00:20:31,053 --> 00:20:34,762
- Take these.
- Wait a minute.

245
00:20:34,853 --> 00:20:40,166
No, no. You won't have to do anything.
They're just for your protection. Sit there.

246
00:20:40,253 --> 00:20:42,562
I just need you to watch.

247
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:48,251
All right. What do we do now?

248
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:51,803
We wait for Robert Barmen to wake up.

249
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:56,844
Do you have any gum?

250
00:21:00,533 --> 00:21:02,524
No.

251
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:48,812
Buffy!

252
00:22:14,453 --> 00:22:16,444
Behind you.

253
00:22:41,853 --> 00:22:43,969
Pike.

254
00:22:44,053 --> 00:22:46,044
Ben?

255
00:22:49,893 --> 00:22:53,647
Where you been, man? I tried
to call your house, like, 50 times.

256
00:22:53,733 --> 00:22:57,169
- I've been hanging.
- You left me hanging. I almost did a Hendrix.

257
00:22:57,253 --> 00:22:59,642
- Let me in.
- This weird guy gave me a ride home.

258
00:22:59,733 --> 00:23:01,769
I thought he was gonna hit on me.

259
00:23:01,853 --> 00:23:04,048
Come on. Invite me in, Pike.

260
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:07,091
Wait a minute, man. What's wrong with you?

261
00:23:07,173 --> 00:23:09,846
- I'm fine.
- You look like shit, man.

262
00:23:10,293 --> 00:23:12,488
Well, I feel pretty.

263
00:23:15,653 --> 00:23:18,565
- You on smoothen?
- No.

264
00:23:23,493 --> 00:23:25,643
Let me in, Pike. I'm hungry.

265
00:23:26,453 --> 00:23:29,684
- Go home, Ben.
- I'm hungry.

266
00:23:29,773 --> 00:23:32,571
You're floating.
Come on, man. Get away from here.

267
00:23:32,653 --> 00:23:36,851
I'm hungry. I'm hungry. I'm hungry!

268
00:23:44,533 --> 00:23:49,687
Now, Buffy, you go to school
tomorrow and act normally.

269
00:23:49,773 --> 00:23:53,607
Don't let anyone know you know
what's happening. This is important.

270
00:23:53,693 --> 00:23:59,245
Because once the vampires find out who you
are, you won't be hunting them any more.

271
00:23:59,333 --> 00:24:02,086
You understand?
They mustn't know your name.

272
00:24:02,173 --> 00:24:03,970
All right.

273
00:24:04,053 --> 00:24:07,045
Meet me at this address
tomorrow after school.

274
00:24:09,053 --> 00:24:13,808
- I have cheer leading practice, OK?
- Well, you're going to have to skip it.

275
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:20,088
They can't come in
unless you invite them in, is that true?

276
00:24:20,173 --> 00:24:23,688
- That's true.
- Good.

277
00:24:32,693 --> 00:24:35,082
Do you know what time it is?

278
00:24:36,013 --> 00:24:38,891
- Around ten?
- I knew this thing was slow.

279
00:24:38,973 --> 00:24:43,364
You pay a fortune for something...
Honey, come on. We're gonna be late.

280
00:25:46,853 --> 00:25:50,482
Wake up, sweetie. You'll be late for school.

281
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:53,601
Are we having a nightmare, Cassandra?

282
00:25:53,693 --> 00:25:58,767
He knows you're awake. Your heartbeat
sounds out to him like thunder.

283
00:26:04,213 --> 00:26:06,010
Oh, my God.

284
00:26:10,693 --> 00:26:12,684
Who are you?

285
00:26:20,493 --> 00:26:23,405
- Hi. You're late.
- I'm gonna practise.

286
00:26:23,493 --> 00:26:25,723
- Cool. See you out there.
- OK. Bye.

287
00:26:31,413 --> 00:26:36,043
Oh, God! What are you doing here?
This is a naked place.

288
00:26:36,133 --> 00:26:38,886
You were supposed to meet me an hour ago.

289
00:26:39,933 --> 00:26:43,642
- I told you that I have practice.
- And I told you to skip it.

290
00:26:43,733 --> 00:26:47,089
Listen, I think there's been
a big mistake, all right?

291
00:26:47,173 --> 00:26:50,961
I appreciate there are real vampires
and you're on this big holy mission,

292
00:26:51,053 --> 00:26:55,922
but obviously somebody read
their tea leaves wrong, COs I'm not your girl.

293
00:26:56,013 --> 00:27:00,052
And I don't think I'm up to it. And, just
between you and me, neither do you.

294
00:27:00,133 --> 00:27:02,124
It is true.

295
00:27:02,213 --> 00:27:05,410
You have missed years of training.

296
00:27:05,933 --> 00:27:08,527
- See?
- And you are undisciplined.

297
00:27:09,333 --> 00:27:11,449
- Frivolous.
- Don't I know it?

298
00:27:11,533 --> 00:27:15,048
Quite probably
the most vacuous choice in my entire...

299
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:18,170
OK. OK, I think we both get the point.

300
00:27:18,973 --> 00:27:22,682
Right. Well, I don't think
there's anything more for us to say.

301
00:27:23,373 --> 00:27:25,364
I guess not.

302
00:27:26,173 --> 00:27:28,733
Good luck an' all.

303
00:27:32,933 --> 00:27:35,322
Oh, yes.

304
00:27:35,413 --> 00:27:39,406
There is... one thing.

305
00:27:40,173 --> 00:27:42,641
- What?
- This.

306
00:27:44,973 --> 00:27:46,964
Bravo.

307
00:27:48,773 --> 00:27:52,049
- You threw a knife at my head.
- Yes. I had to show you.

308
00:27:53,093 --> 00:27:56,642
But... you threw a knife at my head.

309
00:27:56,733 --> 00:28:00,408
And you caught it.
Only the Chosen One could have caught it.

310
00:28:00,493 --> 00:28:03,371
Don't you get it?
I don't want to be the Chosen One.

311
00:28:03,453 --> 00:28:07,128
I don't wanna spend the rest of my life
chasing after vampires.

312
00:28:07,213 --> 00:28:13,049
All I want to do is graduate from high school,
go to Europe, marry Christian Slater and die.

313
00:28:13,133 --> 00:28:17,604
It may not sound too exciting to
a skinhead like you, but I think it's swell.

314
00:28:17,693 --> 00:28:22,244
You come and tell me I'm in the hairy-mole
club so you can throw things at me?

315
00:28:22,973 --> 00:28:24,964
Buffy, it was necessary.

316
00:28:25,053 --> 00:28:28,409
Last night you knew I was
sitting on a fresh grave, didn't you?

317
00:28:28,493 --> 00:28:31,849
Yes, because I had to make
you aware of the implicate...

318
00:28:36,333 --> 00:28:38,972
I never hit anybody before.

319
00:28:39,613 --> 00:28:41,922
Really? Well, you did it perfectly.

320
00:28:42,813 --> 00:28:44,804
I didn't even break a nail.

321
00:30:43,733 --> 00:30:45,803
The heart. Remember?

322
00:30:46,133 --> 00:30:48,966
So when do I meet this guy Lottos?

323
00:30:49,053 --> 00:30:54,730
I don't know. When he comes to you
in your dreams, what does he do to you?

324
00:30:54,813 --> 00:30:57,122
How does he make you feel?

325
00:30:58,013 --> 00:31:01,164
He scares me.

326
00:31:02,133 --> 00:31:08,049
Well, I think we can safely say that
there's something going on with you, Buffy.

327
00:31:09,773 --> 00:31:13,766
Now, there's nothing to be nervous about.

328
00:31:13,853 --> 00:31:16,287
You're not in any kind of trouble.

329
00:31:16,373 --> 00:31:20,889
Don't think of me
as Gary Murray, administrator.

330
00:31:20,973 --> 00:31:28,129
No. Think of me as Gary Murray, party guy.
Happen dude who can talk to the young.

331
00:31:28,213 --> 00:31:31,285
So tell me, it's...

332
00:31:31,373 --> 00:31:35,491
It's drugs, isn't it?
Hey, I know where you're coming from.

333
00:31:35,573 --> 00:31:38,690
Believe me, I've had my drug experiences.

334
00:31:38,773 --> 00:31:43,210
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I did a lot...
well, some acid in the '60s.

335
00:31:43,293 --> 00:31:47,809
See, I was at a Debbie Brothers concert.

336
00:31:47,893 --> 00:31:51,602
And I could see the music flowing in.
It was flowing into me.

337
00:31:51,693 --> 00:31:57,723
It was bright red and electric.
And I felt like I was a big toaster, you know.

338
00:31:57,813 --> 00:32:02,170
And I thought "Well, maybe
I am a toaster, and we're all molecules."

339
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:05,768
My friend Melissa,
her head looked like a big party balloon.

340
00:32:05,853 --> 00:32:09,004
And that... Boy, that scared me! And...

341
00:32:11,173 --> 00:32:14,563
And then I started to freak out.

342
00:32:16,813 --> 00:32:21,523
You said you'd have the part by two o'clock.
Christ, it's almost dark.

343
00:32:22,973 --> 00:32:26,409
What nasty bug crawled up your bungs?
Where the hell are you goin'?

344
00:32:26,493 --> 00:32:31,123
I'm leavin', man. I'm bailin' town.
This place has gotten way too hairy.

345
00:32:31,213 --> 00:32:34,205
Where do I find a mechanic
stupid enough to work for my money?

346
00:32:34,293 --> 00:32:36,523
- Seen Benny lately?
- No.

347
00:32:38,733 --> 00:32:41,566
Hey. What, you want me
to give him a message?

348
00:32:41,653 --> 00:32:44,406
You should think about leaving too, man.

349
00:32:44,493 --> 00:32:49,886
Sell this place. There's something going
on here. I don't know, something real weird.

350
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:54,772
Hey, what do you want me
to do if I see Benny?

351
00:32:54,853 --> 00:32:56,844
Run.

352
00:33:06,813 --> 00:33:08,804
Nice night for a walk.

353
00:33:14,693 --> 00:33:17,446
God, it's cold.

354
00:33:17,533 --> 00:33:19,524
Dark.

355
00:33:28,813 --> 00:33:30,804
§ Feelings

356
00:33:34,773 --> 00:33:36,764
§ Feelings

357
00:33:37,813 --> 00:33:41,806
§ Boy, I'm feeling really helpless

358
00:33:41,893 --> 00:33:43,884
Oh, God.

359
00:33:46,333 --> 00:33:48,642
Wait.

360
00:33:48,733 --> 00:33:50,724
Hello?

361
00:34:14,933 --> 00:34:16,366
Toaster-caked him.

362
00:34:16,733 --> 00:34:19,566
It was a trap, get it? I led him in.

363
00:34:19,653 --> 00:34:24,932
It was a blind alley. Get it? If there'd been any
more of them, you would be dead by now.

364
00:34:25,013 --> 00:34:27,971
You must never forget
the cardinal rule, Buffy.

365
00:34:28,053 --> 00:34:31,932
One vampire is a lot easier to kill than ten.

366
00:34:32,013 --> 00:34:34,607
Does the word "duh" mean anything to you?

367
00:34:35,333 --> 00:34:39,292
You felt sick, didn't you? You had cramps.

368
00:34:39,693 --> 00:34:43,402
Nice conversationalist.
Yeah, I felt them a little.

369
00:34:43,493 --> 00:34:46,929
But I'm not due for a couple of weeks,
since you're so hot on the subject.

370
00:34:47,013 --> 00:34:51,370
No, of course you're not. It was
a natural reaction on the part of a slayer.

371
00:34:51,453 --> 00:34:53,887
A reaction to their unnaturalness.

372
00:34:53,973 --> 00:34:57,249
And you're going to be able
to use that to track them.

373
00:34:57,333 --> 00:35:03,090
Great. My secret weapon is PMS.
That's just terrific. Thanks for telling me.

374
00:35:03,173 --> 00:35:05,971
It's not a weapon. It's an alert system.

375
00:35:06,293 --> 00:35:10,605
Well, aren't we kung fu! I don't see
you out there killing any vampires.

376
00:35:10,693 --> 00:35:12,684
I play my part.

377
00:35:13,453 --> 00:35:18,004
You can play with your part all you want,
but it's my neck on the block.

378
00:35:18,093 --> 00:35:20,129
I'm out there risking my life.

379
00:35:20,213 --> 00:35:23,888
I'm risking my life
and you're not doing anything.

380
00:35:25,293 --> 00:35:28,763
I train girls to be slayers.

381
00:35:29,373 --> 00:35:33,412
I have done so for a hundred lives
and I shall continue to do so.

382
00:35:34,053 --> 00:35:38,365
I am born each time with the knowledge
that my purpose is to prepare the...

383
00:35:38,453 --> 00:35:41,490
Chosen One for her battle.

384
00:35:41,573 --> 00:35:46,010
I am not a slayer,
and I must not interfere, even if I want to.

385
00:35:46,093 --> 00:35:52,805
Even if I think that this time
the girl... is truly exceptional.

386
00:35:56,693 --> 00:35:58,684
So...

387
00:35:59,493 --> 00:36:06,171
What do you do? I mean, you just keep on
living the same old life over and over?

388
00:36:06,493 --> 00:36:11,328
- Yes. Yes, until...
- What? Till there aren't any more vampires?

389
00:36:11,413 --> 00:36:14,485
- Then what?
- Then maybe I'll go to heaven.

390
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:17,523
Or maybe you'll just get a job.

391
00:36:17,933 --> 00:36:22,085
Oh, a job. I would have been
a wonderful bootmaker.

392
00:36:22,173 --> 00:36:25,563
That is so dull. I'm going to be a buyer.

393
00:36:26,213 --> 00:36:29,285
- Of what?
- I don't know. It's just a job I heard of.

394
00:36:29,373 --> 00:36:31,364
Sounded pretty cool, you know.

395
00:36:33,413 --> 00:36:38,282
Buying. Buyer. To buy. I like that.

396
00:36:45,373 --> 00:36:48,012
- We should go to work.
- Yeah.

397
00:36:49,653 --> 00:36:52,372
Quick, before anybody has any fun.

398
00:36:53,253 --> 00:36:58,008
Merrick, I'm not gonna croak that easily.
I have something the other girls didn't have.

399
00:36:58,093 --> 00:37:00,243
And what might that be, pray?

400
00:37:01,013 --> 00:37:03,004
My keen fashion sense.

401
00:37:03,373 --> 00:37:06,046
Vampires of the world, beware.

402
00:37:06,133 --> 00:37:08,727
Merrick, you made a joke.

403
00:37:08,813 --> 00:37:11,805
That's good. Are you all right?
Do you wanna lie down?

404
00:37:11,893 --> 00:37:13,884
I know it hurts the first time.

405
00:37:15,413 --> 00:37:17,404
It was a good joke.

406
00:37:21,253 --> 00:37:24,450
Come on, baby.
Come on, baby. Come on, be good.

407
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:26,524
Come on, come on, come on.

408
00:37:29,253 --> 00:37:31,244
This is not my night.

409
00:37:46,573 --> 00:37:49,963
Come on, baby. This is for the money.
Make me proud. Come on.

410
00:37:52,133 --> 00:37:54,488
Yes. All right.

411
00:38:14,173 --> 00:38:16,846
Get off my car, dude.

412
00:38:31,853 --> 00:38:33,650
Come on.

413
00:39:34,653 --> 00:39:36,962
Give me a break.

414
00:39:37,053 --> 00:39:39,044
You ruined my new jacket.

415
00:39:40,053 --> 00:39:42,567
Kill him a lot.

416
00:40:03,653 --> 00:40:05,848
Hi. Is that your van?

417
00:40:05,933 --> 00:40:08,288
Yeah, why? Is there...

418
00:40:21,893 --> 00:40:24,009
Interesting choice.

419
00:40:24,093 --> 00:40:27,608
Last-minute decision.
Sorry about your guitar.

420
00:40:28,053 --> 00:40:30,613
Hey. You're that weird guy.

421
00:40:34,013 --> 00:40:36,208
- Yeah.
- You've been hurt?

422
00:40:36,293 --> 00:40:40,605
Oh, no. You know what they say -
anyone who can walk away from...

423
00:40:41,453 --> 00:40:44,729
- You know this guy?
- Well, somewhat.

424
00:40:44,813 --> 00:40:48,362
He's rather fond of passing out
just as I happen by.

425
00:40:54,093 --> 00:40:56,891
- You doin' all right? You OK?
- Yeah, I'm good.

426
00:40:56,973 --> 00:40:59,282
l, you know, kinda miss my knees, though.

427
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:01,603
You want some water or anything?

428
00:41:01,693 --> 00:41:04,605
- The kitchen's in here.
- Nope. Got it covered.

429
00:41:16,773 --> 00:41:19,845
So you do this a lot?
I mean, is this like a hobby for you?

430
00:41:19,933 --> 00:41:21,924
Not exactly.

431
00:41:23,493 --> 00:41:26,166
They were vampires, weren't they?

432
00:41:28,853 --> 00:41:32,323
- Yeah.
- God! Vampires. Unbelievable.

433
00:41:34,693 --> 00:41:37,685
You had a car full of stuff. Were you leaving?

434
00:41:37,773 --> 00:41:41,971
Yeah, I was bailin'.
I've got this friend, and he's really...

435
00:41:42,053 --> 00:41:46,205
Well, he's really a vampire, I guess.
It's not a good scene, it's a bad scene.

436
00:41:46,293 --> 00:41:48,853
And tomorrow I'm on a bus. I'm outta here.

437
00:41:49,893 --> 00:41:52,566
- Wow. Are you OK?
- No, I'm fine.

438
00:41:52,653 --> 00:41:55,611
- You sure?
- It doesn't hurt.

439
00:41:56,053 --> 00:41:58,283
I'm OK.

440
00:41:58,813 --> 00:42:03,045
Who are you? I'm sorry,
but you seemed like such a flake.

441
00:42:03,133 --> 00:42:06,011
And I mean that in a good way, really.
It's just...

442
00:42:06,093 --> 00:42:09,881
Hey, I can keep talking until
you strike me dead, or not. I prefer not.

443
00:42:09,973 --> 00:42:13,363
- Things are kinda confusing.
- I'll buy that.

444
00:42:15,133 --> 00:42:18,045
Three weeks ago all I could think about was...

445
00:42:18,133 --> 00:42:22,445
I didn't actually think about anything.
I definitely didn't expect this.

446
00:42:22,533 --> 00:42:25,809
You know what it's like
when everything is suddenly different?

447
00:42:25,893 --> 00:42:32,605
And everything you thought
was crucial seems so stupid?

448
00:42:32,693 --> 00:42:38,563
You find yourself... babbling incoherently
to a strange man in your living room.

449
00:42:43,133 --> 00:42:46,364
Are you... calling me a man?

450
00:42:55,013 --> 00:42:57,083
Listen, I'm gonna go to bed.

451
00:42:58,253 --> 00:43:03,771
If you want to stay,
you can stay in the guest room.

452
00:43:03,853 --> 00:43:08,404
No, I'll stay right here.
Make sure the sun comes up and everything.

453
00:43:10,333 --> 00:43:12,324
OK.

454
00:43:13,733 --> 00:43:16,201
I know what it's like.

455
00:43:24,613 --> 00:43:29,846
You fool. You left the others behind
because of a little thing like this?

456
00:43:29,933 --> 00:43:31,924
On their first kill?

457
00:43:32,853 --> 00:43:34,844
He took my arm.

458
00:43:36,293 --> 00:43:40,889
It's your own fault, you reckless imbecile.

459
00:43:40,973 --> 00:43:44,682
The city of angels is ours for the taking.

460
00:43:44,773 --> 00:43:51,212
But you... 1200 years old,
you behave like a child.

461
00:43:52,133 --> 00:43:54,169
I had him in my grasp.

462
00:43:55,493 --> 00:43:58,963
Cheer up. You may still.

463
00:43:59,933 --> 00:44:03,050
And do something about that arm.
It looks horrible.

464
00:44:03,933 --> 00:44:07,642
Honestly, I don't know how
you made it through the crusades.

465
00:44:08,413 --> 00:44:10,404
I'll be in my chamber...

466
00:44:12,613 --> 00:44:14,604
having a little snack.

467
00:44:20,933 --> 00:44:24,289
They found Cassandra's body in the hills.

468
00:44:24,373 --> 00:44:27,092
I know. It had been there for weeks, all icky.

469
00:44:27,173 --> 00:44:28,970
It's awful.

470
00:44:29,053 --> 00:44:31,647
- She still had my jacket.
- The yellow leather?

471
00:44:31,733 --> 00:44:35,009
- You didn't get that back from her?
- I'm so sorry.

472
00:44:36,253 --> 00:44:40,132
- I loved that jacket.
- There's a memorial service. You goin'?

473
00:44:40,213 --> 00:44:42,852
I don't know.
Coach says I gotta work on my abs.

474
00:44:42,933 --> 00:44:44,969
Oh, got to get some.

475
00:44:51,453 --> 00:44:54,411
I'm sorry. I don't actually need any right now.

476
00:44:55,173 --> 00:44:58,165
- Hey, what is it with you?
- Don't grab me, OK?

477
00:44:58,253 --> 00:45:01,370
Absolutely. I see now the error of my mistake.

478
00:45:01,453 --> 00:45:04,889
Hey, keep your hand off my thang.
I'll pop you one.

479
00:45:05,453 --> 00:45:08,889
- Did he scare you?
- I can take care of myself, all right?

480
00:45:08,973 --> 00:45:10,964
So I noticed.

481
00:45:11,053 --> 00:45:15,012
- Yo, Jeff.
- It's nice to feel needed.

482
00:45:15,093 --> 00:45:17,288
- Let's move out!
- Yes!

483
00:45:18,613 --> 00:45:22,811
I've missed three practices. If I'm not
at the game tomorrow, everybody will talk.

484
00:45:22,893 --> 00:45:25,726
It's just another distraction. It isn't right.

485
00:45:25,813 --> 00:45:29,203
It isn't my fate? It isn't in
the Book of All Knowledgefulness

486
00:45:29,293 --> 00:45:32,968
that I'll be cheering at the game tomorrow?
Lighten up, Merrick.

487
00:45:33,053 --> 00:45:36,011
None of the other girls
ever gave me this much trouble.

488
00:45:36,093 --> 00:45:38,812
And where are they now? Hello?

489
00:45:41,813 --> 00:45:47,092
If we all work together, together it'll all work
out! Are you with me? Now, get out there!

490
00:45:47,173 --> 00:45:49,243
All right. Score some points.

491
00:45:49,333 --> 00:45:54,566
Hey. You missed practice again today. Sit
down and think about how that made me feel.

492
00:45:57,013 --> 00:45:59,004
Go, team, go.

493
00:46:05,853 --> 00:46:07,571
Ready? OK.

494
00:46:07,653 --> 00:46:11,851
How funky is your chicken?
How funky is your chicken?

495
00:46:11,933 --> 00:46:15,369
How loose is your goose?
Our goose is totally loose

496
00:46:15,853 --> 00:46:19,607
So come on, all you Hog fans
So come on, all you Hog fans

497
00:46:19,693 --> 00:46:23,288
And shake your caboose
And shake your caboose

498
00:46:30,613 --> 00:46:34,572
Murph, come on out. You're in.
And remember, you're special.

499
00:46:34,653 --> 00:46:37,929
Thanks. All right. Assert your personhood.

500
00:46:38,013 --> 00:46:40,288
Actualise. Actualise.

501
00:46:48,573 --> 00:46:50,962
More polite. More polite.

502
00:46:51,053 --> 00:46:53,851
Stagger them with your politeness.

503
00:46:53,933 --> 00:46:56,447
I'm open. Grueller?

504
00:46:56,533 --> 00:46:58,524
I'm open!

505
00:47:06,013 --> 00:47:10,404
- We can't have this. Get him out.
- It is reprehensible. The points count, right?

506
00:47:10,493 --> 00:47:12,688
- Get him out.
- Yeah, OK.

507
00:47:16,933 --> 00:47:18,924
Take it, man.

508
00:47:22,533 --> 00:47:24,967
You go get him out.

509
00:47:28,733 --> 00:47:32,931
Grueller's pretty much
abandoned the concept of zones.

510
00:47:37,053 --> 00:47:39,408
There's a girl on the court.

511
00:47:47,613 --> 00:47:49,808
- Buffy.
- He knows who I am.

512
00:47:55,093 --> 00:47:56,845
Got a gear...

513
00:47:56,933 --> 00:47:59,447
Hey, Eric. Must be half-time.

514
00:47:59,533 --> 00:48:02,969
Hey, babe. You wanna get some
real power between your legs?

515
00:48:03,053 --> 00:48:05,965
Yeah, I do.

516
00:48:06,053 --> 00:48:09,363
Dyke! You're a dyke!

517
00:48:09,453 --> 00:48:11,728
I'll tell the world!

518
00:48:20,893 --> 00:48:23,168
Grueller! Grueller!

519
00:48:23,933 --> 00:48:25,924
Come on!

520
00:48:34,253 --> 00:48:36,244
Come on.

521
00:49:23,573 --> 00:49:25,564
Someone get an ouchie?

522
00:49:25,653 --> 00:49:30,966
Grueller, it's me. Remember me? Buffy.
We used to hang. My birthday party?

523
00:49:31,053 --> 00:49:34,682
You drank all the blueberry schnapps
and louched on my mom?

524
00:49:35,853 --> 00:49:39,562
- You were my friend.
- Now I'm a god.

525
00:49:46,293 --> 00:49:49,126
And now you're a coatrack.

526
00:49:51,893 --> 00:49:53,212
Geek.

527
00:49:53,293 --> 00:49:55,284
Here we go.

528
00:50:05,013 --> 00:50:07,129
Look. There.

529
00:50:14,293 --> 00:50:17,444
- Hi.
- Hi. What are you doing here?

530
00:50:17,533 --> 00:50:20,127
What am I doing here? I'm saving your butt.

531
00:50:20,213 --> 00:50:25,287
Well, there was sort of an exchange of butts.
At least I didn't faint.

532
00:50:25,373 --> 00:50:28,046
Pike, you shouldn't have come back.

533
00:50:29,213 --> 00:50:32,205
What am I gonna do? Run?
Where am I gonna go?

534
00:50:32,293 --> 00:50:37,606
These guys are everywhere, and I wanna
do some damage. I'm good with damage.

535
00:50:37,693 --> 00:50:40,207
I'd better find Merrick.

536
00:50:49,253 --> 00:50:52,006
I didn't expect to see you so soon.

537
00:50:55,613 --> 00:50:59,208
I know that guy.
That is a bad guy. Can we go, please?

538
00:50:59,293 --> 00:51:01,443
Has our time finally come?

539
00:51:02,133 --> 00:51:04,442
Have you ripened so fast?

540
00:51:04,533 --> 00:51:07,047
Come closer.

541
00:51:07,133 --> 00:51:09,124
Look at me.

542
00:51:11,093 --> 00:51:14,130
Does anybody here have
a problem with this but me?

543
00:51:19,173 --> 00:51:21,448
Come into my eyes.

544
00:51:21,533 --> 00:51:23,524
Yes.

545
00:51:25,933 --> 00:51:31,291
Hello? This is not a caring nurturer. He's
a bloodsucking fiend from beyond the grave.

546
00:51:31,533 --> 00:51:35,845
Will you be wagging
that jaw of yours while I'm biting it off?

547
00:51:35,933 --> 00:51:37,924
Are you addressing I?

548
00:51:38,013 --> 00:51:40,004
Who's ready to stop me?

549
00:51:41,053 --> 00:51:43,487
It's not you, Merrick.

550
00:51:43,853 --> 00:51:48,927
You finally brought me someone real.
But is she ready?

551
00:51:49,213 --> 00:51:52,285
Well, actually, she's quite a pain in the ass.

552
00:51:52,373 --> 00:51:54,648
- What a pity.
- Your move, Merrick.

553
00:51:55,853 --> 00:52:00,643
Come on, Lefty. Remember what happened
the last time you messed with me?

554
00:52:00,733 --> 00:52:03,930
- I remember.
- Shit.

555
00:52:07,133 --> 00:52:09,442
She's not ready for you, Lothos.

556
00:52:09,853 --> 00:52:14,085
That's too bad. I had such high hopes.

557
00:52:14,733 --> 00:52:16,883
Close your eyes.

558
00:52:18,493 --> 00:52:20,609
No! Not this one.

559
00:52:22,453 --> 00:52:24,171
Lothos.

560
00:52:30,933 --> 00:52:32,889
Ashes to ashes.

561
00:52:37,573 --> 00:52:40,087
Oh, look.

562
00:52:40,173 --> 00:52:42,767
Look... what I've done.

563
00:52:46,493 --> 00:52:48,961
Dust to dust.

564
00:52:49,053 --> 00:52:51,692
- We're leaving.
- We're not eating?

565
00:52:51,773 --> 00:52:53,764
She's not ready.

566
00:52:56,493 --> 00:52:58,484
God.

567
00:52:59,333 --> 00:53:01,324
- Stay still.
- I am still.

568
00:53:03,133 --> 00:53:05,124
I'll get you some help.

569
00:53:09,253 --> 00:53:11,767
You...

570
00:53:11,853 --> 00:53:15,050
You do everything wrong.

571
00:53:18,573 --> 00:53:21,041
Sorry. I take it back.

572
00:53:21,133 --> 00:53:23,124
No.

573
00:53:23,933 --> 00:53:26,242
Do it wrong.

574
00:53:26,333 --> 00:53:29,643
Don't play our game.

575
00:53:30,493 --> 00:53:36,170
Lothos is a... is a show.

576
00:53:36,773 --> 00:53:39,128
Remember about the music.

577
00:53:39,213 --> 00:53:41,204
Listen.

578
00:53:42,133 --> 00:53:48,129
When the music stops, the rest is...

579
00:53:52,013 --> 00:53:54,732
Merrick? Merrick?

580
00:54:41,973 --> 00:54:44,646
It really was mondo bizarro.

581
00:54:44,733 --> 00:54:49,727
When she ran out onto the court, wasn't it
the most out-of-it thing ever, or did I blink?

582
00:54:49,813 --> 00:54:51,804
No. Way mental.

583
00:54:54,653 --> 00:54:57,451
- Oh, hi, Buffy.
- Hi, guys.

584
00:54:57,533 --> 00:54:59,922
You were supposed to be here at three.

585
00:55:00,693 --> 00:55:04,322
- Yeah, I know. I'm sorry, I forgot.
- Buffy, what is your sitch?

586
00:55:04,413 --> 00:55:07,769
You're acting like a thing from
another tax bracket. It's too weird.

587
00:55:07,853 --> 00:55:10,731
Listen, a lot's been going on, guys, OK?

588
00:55:10,813 --> 00:55:14,249
And I really wanted
to talk to you guys about it.

589
00:55:15,853 --> 00:55:20,290
See, a couple of weeks ago, I met this guy...

590
00:55:20,373 --> 00:55:22,887
Oh, my God. You're having an affair?

591
00:55:22,973 --> 00:55:24,964
- Cool.
- Does Jeffrey know?

592
00:55:26,413 --> 00:55:30,850
It's not about that. He's, like, old. He's 50.

593
00:55:33,453 --> 00:55:34,852
- Sick.
- Gross.

594
00:55:34,933 --> 00:55:39,723
Haven't you guys noticed what's been
going on here? The strange things?

595
00:55:40,333 --> 00:55:44,121
Haven't you noticed people disappearing?
Turning up dead?

596
00:55:44,213 --> 00:55:46,408
- What are you talking about?
- Weird.

597
00:55:46,493 --> 00:55:49,849
You mean, like, hanging out
with that homeless Poke?

598
00:55:49,933 --> 00:55:51,969
Pike.

599
00:55:53,693 --> 00:55:57,322
- You're having an affair with him?
- He doesn't look 50.

600
00:55:57,413 --> 00:56:01,247
Guys, I think reality stepped
out of here about five minutes ago.

601
00:56:01,333 --> 00:56:04,325
- Thank you very much.
- Yeah. Like you've got a grip.

602
00:56:04,413 --> 00:56:08,770
You're out of it. Jennifer says you've
blown off cheerleading and dance committee.

603
00:56:08,853 --> 00:56:11,572
Excuse me for having
something important to do.

604
00:56:11,653 --> 00:56:15,487
And this isn't important?
This happens to be the dance.

605
00:56:15,573 --> 00:56:17,404
Right. It's a dance.

606
00:56:17,493 --> 00:56:22,248
It's a stupid dance with a bunch
of stupid people that I see every stupid day.

607
00:56:22,333 --> 00:56:24,449
Like, now we're, like, stupid?

608
00:56:24,533 --> 00:56:27,650
You know, Buffy,
this doesn't happen to be just any dance.

609
00:56:27,733 --> 00:56:31,169
It happens to be
the last dance of our last year.

610
00:56:31,253 --> 00:56:33,562
- Except for the semiformal.
- Right.

611
00:56:33,653 --> 00:56:35,928
- And the totally formal.
- Oh, yeah.

612
00:56:36,013 --> 00:56:38,481
- Oh, yeah. And the senior prom.
- OK!

613
00:56:38,573 --> 00:56:42,486
Buffy, if you wanna play house
with the unwashed masses, that's fine.

614
00:56:42,573 --> 00:56:46,646
But, personally, I think you should
spend a little time prioritising.

615
00:56:46,733 --> 00:56:50,567
- What language are you speaking?
- Get out of my facial.

616
00:56:54,853 --> 00:56:58,243
Well, I guess you got what you came for.

617
00:56:59,893 --> 00:57:02,248
- Nic...
- Later for it.

618
00:57:04,573 --> 00:57:06,689
Jen?

619
00:57:18,773 --> 00:57:23,688
Buff! Hey, Buff. What you been doing?
I've been looking all over for you.

620
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:26,287
I'm going shopping.
Don't try and stop me, OK?

621
00:57:26,373 --> 00:57:28,728
Cool. I need Allen wrenches.
What do you need?

622
00:57:28,813 --> 00:57:30,804
- Dress.
- For what?

623
00:57:30,893 --> 00:57:32,884
- Dance.
- Come again?

624
00:57:32,973 --> 00:57:35,009
I'm going to the senior dance.

625
00:57:35,093 --> 00:57:37,687
The second word sounds like "dance".

626
00:57:37,773 --> 00:57:41,925
- I'm going to the dance.
- For what?

627
00:57:42,013 --> 00:57:45,289
In order to dance, drink punch,
be with my friends, comprende?

628
00:57:45,373 --> 00:57:51,050
No. The world is under attack by legions
of the undead and you're going to a mixer?

629
00:57:51,133 --> 00:57:54,682
It's a senior dance. It's important.
You wouldn't understand.

630
00:57:54,773 --> 00:57:57,606
No, I wouldn't.
I thought you wanted to kill vampires.

631
00:57:57,693 --> 00:58:02,608
I don't wanna kill anybody, OK?
And I don't wanna talk about this any more.

632
00:58:02,693 --> 00:58:06,606
- What about Merrick? Is that what he'd want?
- Merrick's dead.

633
00:58:06,693 --> 00:58:08,763
Cheap shot.

634
00:58:08,853 --> 00:58:13,449
He's dead because of me. Because
I couldn't lift a hand against Lothos.

635
00:58:13,533 --> 00:58:15,524
I'm in way over my head.

636
00:58:15,613 --> 00:58:19,492
Look, life's a bitch. I'll give you that.
But, Buffy, you're the guy.

637
00:58:19,573 --> 00:58:21,564
You are the chosen guy.

638
00:58:22,253 --> 00:58:26,292
Right. I'm the Chosen One.
And I choose to be shopping.

639
00:58:27,133 --> 00:58:30,762
- Yeah, I should have known.
- So leave me alone, all right?

640
00:58:31,813 --> 00:58:37,126
Benny was right. You're all the same.
I'm not disappointed, just angry.

641
00:58:50,773 --> 00:58:52,764
Buffy?

642
00:59:01,933 --> 00:59:05,448
- Buffy.
- Lay out my suit.

643
00:59:05,533 --> 00:59:07,728
We will be attending a dance.

644
00:59:07,813 --> 00:59:11,010
Dance? Master, what are we waiting for?

645
00:59:11,093 --> 00:59:14,403
The Slayer is unmasked. Let's finish it.

646
00:59:14,493 --> 00:59:17,371
- We'll wait until Saturday.
- Why?

647
00:59:17,453 --> 00:59:21,651
Because I want to dance.

648
00:59:22,893 --> 00:59:24,884
I am yours to command.

649
01:00:34,973 --> 01:00:36,964
Nice outfit.

650
01:00:37,733 --> 01:00:40,691
This one doesn't have a mirror at home?

651
01:00:54,693 --> 01:00:58,288
- Have you seen Jeffrey?
- If I say no, are you gonna hurt me?

652
01:00:59,533 --> 01:01:01,888
- No.
- No.

653
01:01:08,613 --> 01:01:10,604
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.

654
01:01:11,493 --> 01:01:17,887
Have you seen Jeffrey? Cos the limo didn't
show up, and I thought maybe he'd be here.

655
01:01:20,053 --> 01:01:22,044
What?

656
01:01:24,933 --> 01:01:27,970
- Jeffrey, there you are.
- Buffy, what are you doing here?

657
01:01:28,053 --> 01:01:31,284
I thought we were gonna come here together.

658
01:01:31,373 --> 01:01:33,364
I'm here with Jenny.

659
01:01:36,813 --> 01:01:40,010
- I don't get it.
- Come on, Buffy. You know what's going on.

660
01:01:40,093 --> 01:01:42,527
It's not working out at all.

661
01:01:42,613 --> 01:01:45,207
I gotta move on. I got needs too.

662
01:01:46,493 --> 01:01:50,611
- I told you about all this.
- No, you didn't.

663
01:01:50,933 --> 01:01:53,606
- Didn't you get my message?
- You left me a message?

664
01:01:53,693 --> 01:01:55,888
You weren't home. Like always.

665
01:01:56,253 --> 01:01:59,609
- You broke up with my machine?
- I'm outta here. Jenny.

666
01:02:00,653 --> 01:02:02,644
Jenny! We're leaving!

667
01:03:16,133 --> 01:03:18,124
God. Pike.

668
01:03:18,693 --> 01:03:20,809
I crashed your party.

669
01:03:20,893 --> 01:03:24,886
- How shallow of you.
- Yeah, well, I'm pretty shallow.

670
01:03:26,773 --> 01:03:28,650
I'm glad you came.

671
01:03:28,733 --> 01:03:34,012
You seemed to be having a swell time,
Queen of the Cardboard Jungle.

672
01:03:38,933 --> 01:03:41,925
Would I get my ass kicked
if I asked you to dance?

673
01:03:44,933 --> 01:03:46,924
Maybe.

674
01:04:03,973 --> 01:04:07,682
You know, Buffy, you're not like other girls.

675
01:04:12,093 --> 01:04:14,084
Yes, I am.

676
01:04:52,453 --> 01:04:54,444
I can't believe it.

677
01:05:04,173 --> 01:05:06,209
Is somebody kidding?

678
01:05:13,373 --> 01:05:16,445
Oh, man. There were
vampires out there, man.

679
01:05:20,613 --> 01:05:22,251
Oh, my God!

680
01:05:22,613 --> 01:05:24,604
OK. Nobody go near the door.

681
01:05:26,853 --> 01:05:29,447
Party time!

682
01:05:30,093 --> 01:05:34,086
Don't worry. They can't come in
unless they're invited.

683
01:05:34,373 --> 01:05:36,364
I already invited 'em.

684
01:05:38,253 --> 01:05:40,323
They're seniors.

685
01:05:40,413 --> 01:05:42,005
Buffy!

686
01:05:42,093 --> 01:05:44,368
You wanna dance?

687
01:05:44,453 --> 01:05:48,048
We want her. We want Buffy. Send her out.

688
01:05:48,133 --> 01:05:50,647
Or we'll come in.

689
01:05:50,733 --> 01:05:55,124
Hey. I have detention slips here
and I'm not afraid to use 'em.

690
01:05:57,333 --> 01:05:59,403
We got a problem.

691
01:06:00,893 --> 01:06:04,283
I got a bag full of solutions.
What are we gonna do about it?

692
01:06:04,373 --> 01:06:06,648
- You're staying here.
- What?

693
01:06:06,733 --> 01:06:09,611
If they come in here,
it's gonna turn into a total stain.

694
01:06:09,693 --> 01:06:11,809
Yeah, you say it like it's a bad thing.

695
01:06:11,893 --> 01:06:14,487
It's a good thing one of us was prepared.

696
01:06:15,333 --> 01:06:19,645
- I'm not gonna let you out there by yourself.
- Don't piss me off.

697
01:06:21,333 --> 01:06:23,528
Buffy!

698
01:06:23,973 --> 01:06:25,850
Hey, Buff.

699
01:06:58,053 --> 01:07:00,851
It's OK. I think they're going after her.

700
01:07:07,133 --> 01:07:09,931
- Jeffrey.
- That was quick.

701
01:07:10,573 --> 01:07:12,564
Run, Buffy. Run.

702
01:07:21,653 --> 01:07:23,848
Look out, dude.

703
01:07:35,973 --> 01:07:38,123
Hi. How's it going?

704
01:07:40,053 --> 01:07:43,728
I'm fine. But you're obviously
having a bad-hair day.

705
01:07:44,293 --> 01:07:46,284
Funny.

706
01:08:08,613 --> 01:08:12,003
Or she could go for what's behind
door number three.

707
01:08:33,493 --> 01:08:35,484
This party sucks, man.

708
01:08:39,173 --> 01:08:41,641
Come on, come on. Fight like a man.

709
01:08:49,533 --> 01:08:54,527
Isn't it great, Pike? Isn't it great?
Finally got those bitches on the run.

710
01:08:55,293 --> 01:08:59,491
Honestly, I leave you alone for five minutes
and look who you're hangin' out with.

711
01:08:59,573 --> 01:09:02,485
It doesn't have to be that way.
I could still change you.

712
01:09:02,573 --> 01:09:04,564
Give me a break, Benny.

713
01:09:05,493 --> 01:09:08,132
Why do you like these people? They're sheep.

714
01:09:10,493 --> 01:09:14,805
Oh, forget them. Live for ever.
We could start a band.

715
01:09:17,533 --> 01:09:23,244
I'll get you, Buffy. And your little dog, too.
I just don't know what he sees in you.

716
01:09:23,333 --> 01:09:26,882
You don't really think
you can stand up to him, do you?

717
01:09:26,973 --> 01:09:32,172
Admit it, Buffy. Aren't there times
when you just feel less than fresh?

718
01:09:35,933 --> 01:09:38,288
You're pathetic.

719
01:09:38,373 --> 01:09:40,762
You're not even fit to die for him.

720
01:09:41,573 --> 01:09:43,882
We're immortal, Buffy.

721
01:09:44,453 --> 01:09:46,523
We can do anything.

722
01:09:46,613 --> 01:09:48,604
Oh, yeah? Clap.

723
01:10:14,933 --> 01:10:17,322
You're gonna wish you'd died.

724
01:10:47,173 --> 01:10:49,687
You know this is our night.

725
01:10:50,093 --> 01:10:52,607
I do.

726
01:10:53,893 --> 01:10:56,088
- It was good, wasn't it?
- What?

727
01:10:56,173 --> 01:11:00,166
Killing him. So intimate.

728
01:11:00,253 --> 01:11:05,452
Your first real kill, and my last gift to him.

729
01:11:06,493 --> 01:11:08,961
- Where is she?
- She's meat for the beast.

730
01:11:09,533 --> 01:11:12,525
The Master wants her.
And Uncle Sam wants you.

731
01:11:16,413 --> 01:11:19,485
- Things change, Ben.
- What's up with that, Pike?

732
01:11:26,173 --> 01:11:31,327
It's time to put away childish things.

733
01:11:43,333 --> 01:11:45,324
Silence.

734
01:11:50,133 --> 01:11:52,283
Look at me.

735
01:11:52,373 --> 01:11:55,570
The rest is silence. That's it.

736
01:11:55,653 --> 01:11:59,441
- What?
- Merrick told me. I knew it all along.

737
01:12:02,693 --> 01:12:04,684
The music stopped.

738
01:12:06,333 --> 01:12:08,324
Look at me.

739
01:12:10,493 --> 01:12:14,281
- It's too late.
- You and I are one.

740
01:12:15,573 --> 01:12:19,088
One what? Cute couple? I don't think so.

741
01:12:21,933 --> 01:12:24,083
You and I... Look at me.

742
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:26,687
You and I are joined.

743
01:12:26,773 --> 01:12:29,731
We're joined? Please!

744
01:12:30,293 --> 01:12:32,887
You stupid little bitch!

745
01:12:32,973 --> 01:12:34,929
How are you gonna stop me?

746
01:12:35,293 --> 01:12:38,649
I am life beyond death.

747
01:12:38,733 --> 01:12:43,011
And you are just like the other girls.

748
01:12:43,093 --> 01:12:45,129
Maybe I'll surprise you.

749
01:12:45,773 --> 01:12:48,731
This is your defence? Please!

750
01:12:49,253 --> 01:12:51,847
- Your puny faith?
- No.

751
01:12:52,933 --> 01:12:55,128
My keen fashion sense.

752
01:13:02,253 --> 01:13:04,244
Detention.

753
01:13:04,933 --> 01:13:10,132
Detention, detention, detention.

754
01:13:10,213 --> 01:13:15,845
Detention, detention. I think that's all of'em.
Nope! Detention, detention.

755
01:13:15,933 --> 01:13:18,891
Hey, look. It's Buffy.

756
01:13:18,973 --> 01:13:23,364
Buffy? No, no! Don't let her in.
They'll kill us! Please keep her out!

757
01:13:31,693 --> 01:13:35,766
Buffy. I didn't think I was gonna
see you again. Are you all right?

758
01:13:37,853 --> 01:13:40,162
Get out of my way. Find my friend Pike.

759
01:13:48,533 --> 01:13:50,763
I'll have you beg.

760
01:13:50,853 --> 01:13:54,607
Split open like rotted fruit, all of you.

761
01:13:55,293 --> 01:13:57,602
That is definitely not a student.

762
01:14:00,533 --> 01:14:02,922
You are my destiny.

763
01:14:05,453 --> 01:14:07,523
I could never hurt you.

764
01:14:16,533 --> 01:14:21,653
I'm gonna send you screaming
to the pits of hell. Trust me!

765
01:14:35,453 --> 01:14:37,967
I haven't finished with you, bitch.

766
01:14:54,573 --> 01:14:56,564
I got him!

767
01:15:04,613 --> 01:15:06,922
Well, I had him.

768
01:15:10,333 --> 01:15:12,449
No, no, no, no.

769
01:15:22,373 --> 01:15:25,206
Now I'm really pissed off.

770
01:15:26,573 --> 01:15:28,962
Good!

771
01:15:30,253 --> 01:15:32,403
Oops.

772
01:15:46,293 --> 01:15:48,011
Pike?

773
01:15:56,173 --> 01:15:58,368
Pike.

774
01:16:00,053 --> 01:16:02,044
I used to be.

775
01:16:04,253 --> 01:16:06,244
Sorry.

776
01:16:07,613 --> 01:16:09,683
You OK?

777
01:16:09,773 --> 01:16:12,890
Yeah, I'm all right. Are you OK?

778
01:16:12,973 --> 01:16:15,043
I can't move my legs.

779
01:16:15,133 --> 01:16:17,647
- Why?
- Cos you're sitting on 'em.

780
01:16:21,013 --> 01:16:23,652
OK, come on. I'll help you up.

781
01:16:34,133 --> 01:16:36,124
Did I do all of that?

782
01:16:37,653 --> 01:16:39,644
No.

783
01:16:39,733 --> 01:16:41,769
Did you do all of that?

784
01:16:41,853 --> 01:16:43,844
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

785
01:16:55,573 --> 01:16:57,564
I saved you a dance.

786
01:17:00,733 --> 01:17:02,724
You gonna ask me?

787
01:17:09,013 --> 01:17:11,288
- I suppose you wanna lead?
- No.

788
01:17:15,133 --> 01:17:17,124
Me neither.

789
01:17:18,933 --> 01:17:20,924
This is a good thing.

790
01:18:30,253 --> 01:18:33,882
...and laid siege, if you will,
to the Hemery senior dance.

791
01:18:33,973 --> 01:18:36,726
They hadfangs, they were biting people.

792
01:18:36,813 --> 01:18:40,806
They had this look in their eyes.
Totally cold. Animal.

793
01:18:41,893 --> 01:18:43,884
I think they were Young Republicans.

794
01:18:43,973 --> 01:18:48,842
It was like a nightmare in there.
Of course, I had to keep my head, but...

795
01:18:48,933 --> 01:18:51,163
I've been there, you know.

796
01:18:51,253 --> 01:18:53,687
Yeah. I saw a lot of action in Nam.

797
01:18:55,093 --> 01:18:57,482
Well, I saw "Platoon".

798
01:18:58,173 --> 01:19:01,927
I'm very happy to accept this honour,

799
01:19:02,013 --> 01:19:07,246
and I will try very hard to fulfiil
my needs as your next Miss America.

800
01:19:07,333 --> 01:19:11,611
I do think the students learned
a valuable lesson about safety.

801
01:19:12,733 --> 01:19:16,612
Except the dead ones,
I mean, of course. Well, they learned it.

802
01:19:16,693 --> 01:19:21,244
But they really didn't have time
to implement it, you know, and...

803
01:19:22,733 --> 01:19:25,008
Are we live?

804
01:19:25,093 --> 01:19:29,405
Well, I felt something was wrong,
so we really got outta there before...

805
01:19:29,493 --> 01:19:33,247
I mean, I heard stuff.
We were nearby. We heard...

806
01:19:33,333 --> 01:19:35,972
I can't believe I let you do that to me.

807
01:19:40,253 --> 01:19:45,088
Details are still sketchy
as to exactly who is responsible.

808
01:19:45,173 --> 01:19:49,610
Gang members? Cultists?
Everyone seemed to see something different.

809
01:19:49,693 --> 01:19:52,969
This is Liz Smith in Los Angeles.
