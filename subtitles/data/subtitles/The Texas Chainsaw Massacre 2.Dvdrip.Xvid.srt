00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,900
-Oh, yeah!
-Hook them horns, baby!

2
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,300
We are on our way
to the biggest party of the world.

3
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,500
Yeah!

4
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,100
Red River Rock 'n' Roll Request Line.
This is Stretch.

5
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,200
<i>That's for Glen.</i>

6
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:07,400
<i>And could you tell the girls</i>
<i>at Mesquite High just to leave him alone?</i>

7
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,100
<i>Got it, and I believe it.</i>
<i>Glen is off-limits now.</i>

8
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:15,500
This is Stretch on an open request line
on K-OKLA in Burkburnett, Texas,

9
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:20,300
Red River Rock 'n' Roll, from the tip-top
of the Dallas Fort Worth Metroplex.

10
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,100
Heck, let's give Stretch a call
and see what she says.

11
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,100
-What kind of name is Stretch?
-No idea.

12
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,700
Red River Rock 'n' Roll Request Line.
This is Stretch.

13
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,800
Yo, Stretch!
It's the one and only Buzz.

14
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,800
And Rick the Prick!

15
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:45,500
And from all the senior boys
at Wheeler High to all the senior girls,

16
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,800
who are so stuck-up, boy,
you're on the road to nowhere.

17
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,700
No, you mean,
"We're on the road to nowhere."

18
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,800
No, baby.

19
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,700
We're on the road
to Texas-OU Weekend in Dallas!

20
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,200
You're on the road to nowhere!

21
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,300
Hook them horns, baby!

22
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,300
Real funny, guys.

23
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,000
Okay, you wanna hang up now?

24
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,900
Tying up the line. Hey, come on.

25
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,200
-No way, baby!
-We got a lot more requests!

26
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,600
Hey, check it out, dude.

27
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,700
Let's play a little chicken
with the farmer here.

28
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,600
-Come on, baby! Come on!
-Come on!

29
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,600
Come on, man.

30
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,100
Come on!

31
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,500
-Hot damn!
-Hook them horns!

32
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,100
That was great! That was great!

33
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,400
You got that, babe? Hot line?

34
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,400
<i>You better stick with us, baby!</i>

35
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,800
Yeah. Later, sports. Just hang up, okay?

36
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,200
No way!

37
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,200
Hook them horns!

38
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:03,200
<i>-L.G!</i>
<i>-Damn it, I'm trying, darling.</i>

39
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,200
<i>Don't call me darling, damn it.</i>

40
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,700
It's 8:11, Texas-time, on a Friday night.

41
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,400
I know nobody's listening
because y'all are all zooming,

42
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,200
but I got a shot of hot rock 'n' roll
for you anyway.

43
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,800
K-OKLA, Red River Rock 'n' Roll Request.

44
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,400
What it is, Stretch? This is the Buzz again.

45
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:08,200
Not again. Hang it up, lame-o.
Go call your mother.

46
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,400
Yeah, yeah, talk dirty.
But this is for Rick the Prick.

47
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,100
He wants to hear
<i>Bright Lights, Big Titties.</i>

48
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,400
Wrong. I don't want to hear it.
I want to see it!

49
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,400
Bright lights, big titties!

50
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,700
L.G? L.G., get in here, please.

51
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,700
What the fuck?

52
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,900
Are you crazy?

53
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,200
Back up, pig fucker!

54
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,900
Come on. Hurry up. Get out of here!

55
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,700
<i>Oh, my God!</i>
<i>They gotta hang up.</i>

56
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:04,900
<i>Step on it!</i>

57
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:08,400
-Shit! What the fuck?
-Come on, hurry up!

58
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,800
<i>Hang up!</i>

59
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,900
-What the hell is that?
-Look, it's some kind of geek.

60
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,800
-The geek's got a...
-Come on. What is that?

61
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,800
-Shit!
-Come on. Get out of here.

62
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,200
-Where'd he come from?
-I don't believe this shit!

63
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,000
Just keep driving. Come on.

64
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,800
-Hey, let's go. Come on.
-What the hell is that?

65
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,800
-Go on! What's he doing?
-God damn it!

66
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,300
What's he got there?

67
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,800
Jesus Christ!

68
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,400
-What?
-Come on. What is that?

69
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,000
-I don't believe this shit!
-Come on!

70
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,400
<i>You can do it! Come on!</i>

71
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:49,000
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God!

72
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,800
-Holy shit!
-Come on, get out of here!

73
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,000
He's got a fucking chainsaw!

74
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,600
-Sounds like a buzz saw.
-Buzz saw?

75
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,600
Hey, hang up, man.

76
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,200
Hang up. Hang up, hang up, hang up,
hang up, hang up, hang up, hang up!

77
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,600
Get him. Shoot the bastard. Get him. Shit!

78
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,400
Fuck! Shoot that motherfucker, yeah!

79
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:38,200
Shit! Keep back! God!

80
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,700
Son of a bitch! Shit!

81
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,800
Missed us, assholes.

82
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,100
What? It just cut off.

83
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,300
Did you do that? What happened?

84
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,800
It's like super feedback.

85
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,900
Just put the underwoofer
across the overflapper.

86
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,400
I don't know.

87
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,900
Just went dead air.

88
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,400
-I want the license plate.
-No problem.

89
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,600
All right, now, ease up here.

90
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,200
You go get your pictures.

91
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,900
Watch out, Bob.

92
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,900
All right, keep
the tension on that line.

93
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,400
Hey, loosen that chain.
We need some slack.

94
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,300
Easy. Easy.

95
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,700
You, get out of there!

96
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,700
<i>Three-zero.</i>

97
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,200
Cowboy, get away from there.
This is an accident scene.

98
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,600
The area is restricted.

99
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,700
-Not gonna tell you...
-It's all right. It's all right, Wendell.

100
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,800
Lieutenant Enright, sir.

101
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,000
We heard you might be headed this way.
Did you come over for the big game?

102
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,400
You know why I'm here.

103
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,100
Yes, sir,
something about the chainsaw killers,

104
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,000
your brother's kids killed.

105
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:08,400
But that was 14 years ago, sir,
way down in South Texas.

106
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,200
Now, these are other kids.

107
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,900
This is just an accident.

108
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:16,300
Just a couple of wild punks
out raising hell.

109
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,900
Yep.

110
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:22,100
One of those boys is so wild
sawed his own head off

111
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,200
going 90 mile per hour.

112
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,100
Hell.

113
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,000
Hell's exactly what they raised.

114
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,800
No, sir, that information's off the record.

115
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:47,500
You know, sir, this is always
a pretty hairy weekend for Dallas.

116
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:51,000
Whole lot of folks come to town
and don't give a damn about football.

117
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,700
You know, they just wanna go blood crazy
for a few and riot.

118
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,000
You know what "riot" means.
You were a Ranger.

119
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,300
I can't hardly keep them down by law,
and if...

120
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,000
If you go around
promoting this chainsaw...

121
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,900
Try to speak plain.

122
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,500
Saves time.

123
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,900
I have authority

124
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:13,600
from the DA's office to put you
right back on the next plane to Amarillo.

125
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:19,100
Well, you just do that, son.
I'd like to see that authority.

126
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,900
All right, Lieutenant Enright,
what's your deal?

127
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,200
All right.

128
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,000
I'm gonna ask some questions.

129
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:38,000
Put it in the press. Get it in the news.

130
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,700
Any information about this accident

131
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,900
and maybe some witnesses.

132
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:50,300
Yes, sir,
I know some old boys at the paper.

133
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,300
We'll get your story out for you.

134
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,000
Brazos.

135
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,700
Brazos.

136
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,200
Brazos!

137
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:08,000
Remember the Alamo, cowboy.

138
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,200
I won!

139
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,600
Come on!

140
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,300
Asshole.

141
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,000
You need a witness? I'm a witness.

142
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,900
This Mercedes? I think I was talking
to those kids when it happened.

143
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,300
No way was that an accident.

144
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,100
-You saw it.
-No, but I heard it.

145
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,900
You can listen. It's here on tape.

146
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,500
Regulations.
We gotta record all the call-ins.

147
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,900
End of the night, we wipe the tapes,

148
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,800
but I kept this one just 'cause...
It just got to me.

149
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,700
We got professionals working on this...

150
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,200
I didn't know what I'd heard,
but I read your story.

151
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,500
-What you're looking for is on this tape.
-...so don't fool with it.

152
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,000
You can slow it down now.

153
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,800
You're just a joke in this morning's paper.

154
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,500
"Cowboy chases chainsaws 14 years.

155
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,000
"Dallas police refuse comment."

156
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,200
Like you're, you know,
hung up on something crazy.

157
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,900
But I believe you.
I might be the only believer you got.

158
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,300
-'Cause it's right here.
-What is?

159
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,800
Right on here, those kids getting killed.

160
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,200
Now, this is evidence, sort of, right?

161
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:33,500
Yeah, it's time for you to go home.

162
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,600
-No, wait a minute, wait a minute.
-Come on.

163
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,700
Look, I came here
because I thought I could help you.

164
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,700
I deejay this dumb show
on K-OKLA up in Burkburnett,

165
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,600
but people listen to me
all across North Texas.

166
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,800
Now, I could put you on the radio,

167
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,200
get people to believe you,
get you some help.

168
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,200
You're gonna get in my way.

169
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,300
-Don't you get in my way.
-No, I'm already right in the middle of this.

170
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,400
This is my chance
to stop playing head-banging music

171
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,700
and do something real.

172
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,200
Well, I don't need anybody
to stand with me,

173
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,400
all right?

174
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,600
You can't do it alone.

175
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,500
I got a perfect willingness to die.

176
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,200
That gives me a moral
on this bunch of mad dogs.

177
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:17,200
They live on fear. They thrive on it.

178
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,500
I ain't got no fear left.

179
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,000
I ain't got no fear, Lord.

180
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:05,700
-Hardass.
-Hardass? Me?

181
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:10,900
Well, maybe a semi-hardass,
but I got a soft heart.

182
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,500
Looky.

183
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:17,100
-Built you a little fry house.
-L.G!

184
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,600
What, darling?

185
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,300
Oh, L.G.

186
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:42,700
<i>Okay, everybody, hush up. Listen up, y'all.</i>

187
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,900
<i>The Texas-OU Chili Cook-off champion is</i>

188
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:50,700
<i>from Norman, Oklahoma? No.</i>

189

<i>Waco, Texas?</i>

190
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,800
<i>Tulsa? Nope.</i>

191
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,400
-Pardon me.
<i>-Austin?</i>

192
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,800
<i>He's Dallas' favorite caterer.</i>
<i>I think he's kind of cute.</i>

193
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:05,100

Drayton!

196
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,800
Drayton! Drayton! Drayton! Drayton!

197
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,400
Way to go, Drayton!

198
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,400
It's the second year in a row.
This year, Drayton,

199
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,400
you've got to tell the secret
of that fabulously tasty chili!

200
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,900
<i>No secret. It's the meat.</i>

201
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,600
<i>Don't skimp on the meat.</i>

202
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:41,000
<i>I got a real good eye for prime meat.</i>

203
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,600
<i>Runs in the family.</i>

204
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,400
Oops! Oops!

205
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,200
<i>It's one of those hard-shell peppercorns.</i>

206
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,900
<i>I gotta say, I love this town.</i>

207
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,000
<i>This town loves prime meat!</i>

208
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:06,000
<i>So there's the big story.</i>
<i>Texas clobbers Oklahoma in chili.</i>

209
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:10,000
<i>This is Stretch, your fearless reporter,</i>

210
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,300
<i>Now, be sure to watch</i>

213
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,600
Cut-Rite.

214
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,200
No, C.L., I ain't seen Fletcher.

215
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,900
Well, last Friday.

216
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,400
Well, hell, he's on the road, then.

217
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,800
Well, don't believe me, then. Fine.

218
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,600
C.L.

219
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,500
No.

220
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,300
I'll be with you in just a minute, sir.

221
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,600
Now, you're getting
as mean as a sting bat, C.L...

222
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,100
No, hell, don't call back.

223
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,900
No, don't you call back.
I got a business here,

224
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,900
and Fletcher ain't none of my business.

225
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,900
Damn!

226
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,400
What can I do you for?

227
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,000
Well, don't you wanna test them?
There's gas in them.

228
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,700
Get them suckers a time or two.

229
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:23,700
Oh, my kid banana.

230
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,600
Damn, what is he doing?

231
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:02,000
Now, this is very hard to believe.

232
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,700
I'd like you to play that tape, missy.

233
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:16,300
Come all the way up here to Burkburnett.
No shit!

234
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,500
Yeah.

235
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,000
Oh, you wanna hear it now.

236
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,500
I wanna hear it on the radio.

237
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,200
On your show.

238
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:26,800
Uh-uh.

239
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,400
I don't think it'd be legal to do that.

240
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,300
FCC regulations, those things.

241
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,900
Well, you just figure out how to do it
and do it.

242
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,400
You bend the rules. I don't know.

243
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,900
-Why?
-Because the killers are here.

244
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:52,400
Kill sites have been clustered all over
Northeast Texas the last two years.

245
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:02,100
The laws, they shy away
from piecing it together as murder.

246
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,200
They call it accidents, disappearances.

247
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,700
You got that last slaughter on tape.
You play it on the radio.

248
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,900
Maybe then, the laws will stop trying
to shut me up and start helping me.

249
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,600
Besides, it'll give you
something real to do.

250
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,700
You said you were gonna do this alone.

251
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,700
I need your help, missy.

252
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,200
Well,

253
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:34,700
you can call me Stretch, Mr. Enright.

254
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:37,700
Well, now, you can call me Lefty.

255
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,600
It's mighty nice doing business with you.

256
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,500
-Thanks.
-All right.

257
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,700
You have a nice day, now.

258
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,300
You, too.

259
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,500
Number one again!

260
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:20,300
Drayton did it again. Number one.

261
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:23,700
Number one!
The Sawyers are number one!

262
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,100
Number one.

263
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:38,300
So here's a special request
we're doing this afternoon and tonight.

264
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,200
You steady listeners know
we're playing this every hour.

265
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,500
This is for Lefty.

266
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:47,700
<i>Hog fucker! Son of a bitch!</i>

267
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,800
Last Round-up Rolling Grill.
We're still number one.

268
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,100
I told you, boys, and I told you.

269
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:04,100
Don't call on this phone.
Now, damn it, get off.

270
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:07,100
What? What's on the radio?

271
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,800
Now, don't bullshit me. I can't...

272
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:13,900
I won't... All right, what station?

273
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,800
This ain't no joke, boy?

274
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,800
Then I'm tuning it in.

275
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:22,100
<i>Hog fucker! Son of a bitch!</i>

276
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,500
You two nap-haired idiots.

277
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,300
You've done it again!

278
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,900
You coon shits! You fudge-packers!

279
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,800
You'll be the death of me yet!

280
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,700
<i>Missed us, assholes.</i>

281
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,100
K-OKLA.

282
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,500
Come on, Lefty. Where are you?

283
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,500
This concludes the broadcast day
for K-OKLA in Burkburnett, Texas,

284
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,100
Red River Rock 'n' Roll.

285
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,600
In New York, it's 1:00 a.m.,
still fun city.

286
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,300
In LA, 10:00 at night, party time.

287
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,800
But deep in the heart of Texas,
it's 12:00 midnight.

288
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,000
Ain't nothing going on.

289
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,600
<i>It's another cussing caller.</i>

290
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:18,600
<i>Your little ass is gonna be</i>
<i>in big trouble over that tape, girl.</i>

291
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,900
Nope.

292
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,800
Sure got a lot of complaints, darling.

293
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
L.G., it was a request, right?
It's listed in the logs as a request.

294
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,100
People complain
about the request every night, right?

295
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:55,900
Uh-huh.

296
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,500
Wanna go for coffee at Big State?

297
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,500
Nope.

298
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,200
I guess you're waiting on this guy, Lefty?

299
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,500
L.G.

300
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,700
Night, L.G.

301
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,600
Good night.

302
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,500
God damn it!

303
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,000
Shit!

304
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,200
K-OKLA, this is Stretch.

305
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,100
Hello?

306
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,600
Hello?

307
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,400
Hello?

308
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,300
Hello, Lefty?

309
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,900
L.G?

310
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,600
Lefty?

311
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,900
Lefty?

312
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:59,000
I wanna buy some radio-ad time.

313
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Are you fucking crazy? We are closed!

314
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,600
Off the air till tomorrow.
You'll have to just come back.

315
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,700
No, but... But, yeah, but...

316
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Whoa...

317
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,600
So this is radio land, huh?
The infinite turnover?

318
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,200
The waves through
the ether fuzz roll on forever.

319
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,600
Can't close that.
Hi, I know what you're thinking.

320
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,900
"This is weird. Hope I can handle it."

321
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,600
You know,

322
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,900
you're my fave.

323
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:35,900
Me and Bubba, my little brother,
we listen to you every night.

324
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,700
Music is my life.

325
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,800
You know, you're my fave,

326
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:46,500
but I get too embarrassed
to phone in my request.

327
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,500
It's too disembodied, you know?

328
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,700
But

329
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,000
Now that we're here in flesh and blood,

330
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
I could maybe make a request,
and it'd still count, huh?

331
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,900
Sure.

332
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,800
Well, what about

333
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,300
Iron Butterfly?

334
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,100
You know, like <i>In-A-Vida-Da-Gadda, Baby?</i>

335
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:14,800
Oh, it's heavy! You know,

336
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:18,900
I've never been to a radio station before.

337
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:21,200
Do you think you could do me a tour, huh?

338
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,700
Tour?

339
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:27,400
Tour. Sure, sure.

340
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:31,100
But seriously quick,
and it ends at the exit sign.

341
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:34,500
Oh, boy! Okay, yeah, sure!

342
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:38,100
Okay, your tour. Here's your tour.
Here's your tour. Here's a lamp.

343
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,900
Yeah, lamp.

344
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,600
Here's a typewriter.

345
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:45,100
-Rubber man.
-Rubber man. I like him.

346
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:48,500
Armadillo. Here's Mr. Shark.

347
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,600
Oh, Mr. Shark!

348
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,200
-Here's some flowers.
-Flowers.

349
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:58,100
-Rolodex.
-Rolodex.

350
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,600
Here's a lamp.

351
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,900
And there's the exit sign. Tour's over.

352
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:26,400
"E-X-I-T.

353
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,300
"Exit."

354
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:34,500
-Good night.
-Oh! Good night!

355
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,100
Good night!

356
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,900
Good night.

357
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,000
Good night!

358
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,900
Good night.

359
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:57,000
Hey, what about my request?

360
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,000
You know,

361
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:03,900
that Lefty-request record

362
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:06,900
that you honked out today?

363
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:09,300
I love that!

364
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,200
Let's see.

365
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:24,900
What was it, anyway?
The <i>Rambo III</i> soundtrack?

366
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,000
Gonna play it again?

367
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:41,500
Sure would like it.

368
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:45,900
Hey, maybe I could get a copy,

369
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,400
and you could autograph it.

370
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,400
To a far-out fan!

371
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,500
-What's in here?
-Record vault.

372
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,800
Oh, where you keep the golden oldies?

373
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,600
And maybe...

374
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,700
Maybe the new music's in...

375
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,400
Not me, you dumbass!

376
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:12,200
Get the girl! Get the girl!

377
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,600
Ow, ow, ow!

378
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:37,300
He dented my plate! My brain is burning!

379
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,900
Nam flashback! Nam flashback!

380
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:46,100
Leatherface, you bitch, I'll...

381
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,300
Look what you did
to my Sonny Bono wig-do.

382
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:52,000
Oh, God damn, I can't believe it!

383
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,100
You gonna have to buy me
a new plate cover!

384
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:56,500
You gonna have to buy me
a new plate cover, Leatherface.

385
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,500
He's gonna send me back
to the VA Hospital

386
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,100
with this dent in my plate.

387
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:17,000
Well, at least he didn't mess me up.

388
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,600
Dog will hunt.
Get that bitch, Leatherface.

389
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,200
Get that bitch!

390
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,200
Dog will hunt.

391
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,800
Go away!

392
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:50,900
Shit. Humble Pie!

393
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,900
Hurry up, Leatherface. Hurry up.
Get that bitch!

394
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,400
Go away!

395
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:08,300
Music is my life!

396
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:24,800
They live on fear. They live on fear.
They live on fear.

397
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:29,200
They live on fear. They live on fear.
They live on fear.

398
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,600
Stretch, darling,
you know the door's unlocked?

399
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,500
Hey!

400
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,700
What the shit?

401
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:28,900
Hey! Lick my plate, you dog dick!

402
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,600
What the fuck you think
you're doing in here,

403
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,800
you crazy-looking little son of a bitch?

404
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,000
Get out of here!

405
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:52,200
Time for incoming mail!

406
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,100
Ho Chi Minh!

407
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:07,800
A-one and a-two and a-three!

408
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,700
Go, you little bitch!

409
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,500
Go away! Leave me alone!

410
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:31,300
No, no, no, no! God, no, please don't!

411
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:33,300
Incoming mail!

412
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,000
No, no, no!

413
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,700
No, no, no, please, God, no!

414
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:49,700
No, no, no, please, God! Please, God, no!

415
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,900
No!

416
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:56,200
No, no, no, please, God! Stop it! God, no!

417
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,000
No, no, please, God!

418
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,800
Are you mad at me?

419
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,400
How mad at me are you?

420
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,600
You're not really mad at me.

421
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,300
How good are you?

422
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,000
Huh?

423
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:46,800
Get that bitch, Leatherface!
Get that bitch!

424
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:55,500
How good

425
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,900
are you?

426
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,600
Oh...

427
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,200
Really?

428
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:30,100
Are you really, really

429
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,400
good?

430
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:43,600
Are you really good?

431
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:48,300
You're really good.

432
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,100
You're the best.

433
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:06,300
Oh, no.

434
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:21,300
No! No!

435
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:29,700
Please don't kill me!

436
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:32,000
No, God!

437
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,500
No, God!

438
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:37,200
No, please, God!

439
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,000
No, God!

440
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:59,100
Oh, God! Oh, God!

441
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:13,400
Leatherface.

442
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:19,800
Did you get her, Bubba?
Did you get that bitch?

443
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:28,100
She was my fave, but she knew.

444
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,300
And now, nobody knows.

445
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:38,300
Look what you did to my plate, you bitch!

446
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,100
You got her? Did you get her good?

447
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:44,700
Slap me five.

448
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,500
I got one, too.

449
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:50,100
A bonus body!

450
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:53,900
Look at that beef.

451
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:55,700
Help me get it out of here.

452
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:02,700
Whoa...

453
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:08,800
Giddyup!

454
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:19,500
No, they'll get away.

455
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,700
No, no, they'll get away.

456
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,100
They can't get away.

457
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:42,600
God damn it, Lefty. You're late.

458
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,500
Damn it, Lefty.

459
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,600
No!

460
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:32,800
Stretch!

461
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:36,500
Lefty?

462
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:41,500
Stretch!

463
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:45,300
Hold on!

464
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:47,900
Grab onto something. Hold onto it.

465
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Lefty, they came! Where were you?

466
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:55,200
I had to do it. Damn, I used you, girl.

467
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:57,300
I'm here now. Grab hold of this.

468
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:02,200
Grab hold of this, now.
Don't you cry, little sister. I'm here now.

469
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:05,100
Come on, I'm here now. You can get it.
Come on, now.

470
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,900
You got it. Come on.

471
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:16,200
Come on! Grab it!

472
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:57,100
Oh, my God.

473
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:35,600
Oh, Lord, help me beat this stranger
that walks beside me,

474
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:37,700
that takes away my strength.

475
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:40,600
Lord, you show me the end.

476
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:45,300
Show me what I fear
so I don't fear it no more.

477
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:13,200
It's the devil's playground.

478
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:23,500
I'm bringing it down! Down to hell!

479
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:29,200
Bring it all down!

480
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:34,200
Bring it all down!

481
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:23,600
I hate to say it, but that hillbilly hog
you boys got earlier is the tops tonight.

482
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:26,100
That's mine! Mine!
Not Bubba's. Me! Me!

483
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:27,600
Bust it up!

484
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:29,000
Wanna go to the movies?

485
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:31,700
No crowds.
Everybody's at the football parties.

486
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:33,300
Tonight's a washout.

487
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:37,400
Biggest meat-eater weekend of the month,
and we're gonna lose money on it.

488
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:39,500
Damn it all! Maybe we just ought to quit.

489
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:44,000
Oh, yeah? Kiss my plate,
Mr. Big Shot. Maybe you forgot.

490
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,400
This chromedome
bankrolled this food business.

491
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:49,100
No lucky goof with a machete,
no head wound.

492
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,200
No head wound,
no fancy rolling grill a-go-go.

493
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:54,700
Ain't no fool. Kiss it. Don't forget it.

494
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:03,200
Peel that pig
and slice him thick.

495
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:07,300
-That's my sweet pea.
-Get them hogs on the grill.

496
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:11,600
Big, big pre-game brunch tomorrow
means a ton of croissant sandwiches.

497
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:13,600
Oh, I love this town.

498
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:16,900
Hey, you nitwit,
get back in here and get that grill going.

499
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,200
No. No. No good.

500
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:25,700
No good.

501
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:28,500
No good.

502
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,500
Come on, Bubba. Cook's out here,
and he's chewing ass like it was steak.

503
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:02,600
"You gotta run for that money now.

504
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:05,100
"Chase that dollar.
Gotta go fast to catch it."

505
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:08,300
You dumb baboozer.
Too dumb to even close the door.

506
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:10,200
I'm tired of kicking your asses.

507
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:15,900
What are you doing?
You trying to hide something?

508
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:23,200
Get that eyeball pâté working.

509
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:25,500
Hey, you coon shit, where are you going?

510
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:27,400
We need the club sandwiches...

511
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:32,600
Help. Help me. Please.

512
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,200
Please, help me.

513
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:37,800
Can you help me get out of here?

514
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,900
Can you help me get out of here?

515
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:47,500
What is it? Put that down. Put that down.

516
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:49,000
Put that down.

517
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:51,000
What is that?

518
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,300
Is it wet? It's wet. Put it down.

519
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:35,700
My darling.

520
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:40,700
Darling?

521
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:42,600
Darling?

522
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:44,700
Don't be scared, darling.

523
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:53,700
Oh, no, L.G.

524
01:00:59,100 --> 01:01:01,600
Oh, no. Oh, no.

525
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:03,900
L.G!

526
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,200
Oh, my God!

527
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:11,500
L.G., they got you, too?

528
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:13,300
Oh, L.G!

529
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:20,000
We gotta get y'all loose.

530
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:00,600
I guess I'm falling apart on you, honey.

531
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:08,500
No.

532
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:12,500
No.

533
01:02:18,100 --> 01:02:19,200
Shit.

534
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:08,600
L.G.,

535
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:12,000
I love you.

536
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:32,600
So he says,

537
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:36,800
"Hey, get me those lawyers. Legal meat."

538
01:03:36,700 --> 01:03:37,600
Legal meat, yeah!

539
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:38,500
Legal meat, yeah!

540
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:40,900
Bubba, you idiot!
Get your ass over here.

541
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:43,000
-You fucked up again.
-You fucked up again.

542
01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:45,800
He says,
"Hey, get me those lawyers.

543
01:03:45,700 --> 01:03:47,400
"Legal meat, y'all."

544
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:49,100
Fuck me in the left eye!

545
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:55,100
Valuable kill-time wasted running down
them cooped-up pencil necks,

546
01:03:55,100 --> 01:03:57,600
and not a good chop on the whole bunch.

547
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:59,500
I pick the vittles. Get it?

548
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:02,500
-I. Me. Nobody but...
-I pick the vittles, I.

549
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:05,100
-Bubba, you hull wreckage!
-Me. Nobody but...

550
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:09,400
Busted again, huh?
That's the main support beam.

551
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:15,500
Fuck, you idiots! You both will pay!

552
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:17,500
Both of you... You're both...

553
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:20,800
Look what your brother's done now.
You coon shit.

554
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:25,000
You cut the main support beam.
And this is what happens.

555
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,200
Of course this is what happens.

556
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:30,300
That big brute!

557
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:32,200
Dirty meat don't cut it.

558
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:35,600
Family standards only require
the best meat in town.

559
01:04:35,900 --> 01:04:37,500
More money lost.

560
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:40,500
I never, never, never get a break.

561
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:43,000
Work, work night and day,

562
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:46,300
presenting myself to the people,
selling, selling.

563
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:50,700
You pair of prima donnas fooling around
here and listening to the radio all day

564
01:04:50,900 --> 01:04:53,900
and sawing down your own house.

565
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:02,800
Take it all down!

566
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:05,100
Bring it all down!

567
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:07,300
Bury the devil!

568
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:14,000
May the Lord have mercy on our souls!

569
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:21,000
Get that thing out of here.

570
01:05:21,100 --> 01:05:24,300
Maybe it cracked the main butane tank.

571
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:27,500
It's up there. Go look at it.

572
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:30,300
Taxes. Taxes.

573
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:32,900
Damn property taxes fuck up everything.

574
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:36,800
Crooks don't pay taxes. Politicians don't.

575
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:38,800
Movie stars don't.

576
01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:43,800
It's the little guy that can't make a dime.
He pays the taxes.

577
01:05:43,700 --> 01:05:46,800
Small businessman gets it in the ass
every time.

578
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:48,300
I ought to quit.

579
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:52,400
Right, it's junk. Quit.
Dump this cook show.

580
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:56,700
Sell off this turkey.
It's time. It's in the air.

581
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:58,300
It's what the public wants.

582
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:00,300
I don't wanna hear that again.

583
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:02,500
It's Nam Land!

584
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:09,800
What the hell was that?

585
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:13,000
I don't know, boy.
It looked like a big, big fireball.

586
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:23,300
Nam Land.

587
01:06:24,700 --> 01:06:26,000
Napalm.

588
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:28,900
Fire in the hole.

589
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:37,200
That's the main butane tank
up there, Bubba.

590
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:40,900
Go look at it. Get your butt moving, boy.

591
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:44,300
Go up there and look at it.
Go look at it.

592
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:47,700
-I'll kick you in the ass again.
-Not now. It's Nam Land.

593
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:51,200
-It's a hit. It's a bang. It's a smash.
-Shut him up, Bubba.

594
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:03,400
Did you see it?

595
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:06,400
Well, did you? Didn't you?

596
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:08,400
Did you? Didn't you?

597
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:11,100
Go check it out, boy.

598
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:15,300
-Nam Land!
-Oh, shut up!

599
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:18,200
I told you to go check it out, boy,
before I start kicking your ass.

600
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:21,800
Some kind of crazy booger
just skipped through here.

601
01:07:21,700 --> 01:07:24,900
No, a booger? How big?

602
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:29,400
A big crazy booger.
Let's haul butt, bro.

603
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:53,200
Oh, my God.

604
01:07:59,900 --> 01:08:01,100
Oh, God.

605
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:14,300
Franklin.

606
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:34,500
Don't you cry, my brother.

607
01:08:37,100 --> 01:08:38,300
I'm here now.

608
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:41,700
I'm here now.

609
01:08:43,100 --> 01:08:44,600
They can't do this.

610
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:46,800
They can't do this!

611
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,800
They can't do this! They can't do this!

612
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:03,500
I'll take you back to hell!

613
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:05,800
I'll take you to hell!

614
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:22,100
All right, all right!

615
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:25,200
Let's talk about it.

616
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:28,800
Okay. What, are you pissed-off?
What about me?

617
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:30,900
Listen, this is not gonna work out.

618
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:38,700
I'm trying to be open with you.
It's nobody's fault. I just can't do this.

619
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:43,700
Let me go.

620
01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:47,400
Let me go.

621
01:11:48,100 --> 01:11:51,300
What the hell's going on here?

622
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:57,100
Bubba, you nap-haired idiot.

623
01:11:57,400 --> 01:11:58,700
Get out of here.

624
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:04,500
Who's this? I get it.

625
01:12:04,900 --> 01:12:08,300
Are you the saboteur
that's fucking up our house?

626
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,100
Trying to put me out of business?

627
01:12:11,300 --> 01:12:13,300
Thousands of dollars lost.

628
01:12:13,300 --> 01:12:16,200
You got that kind of money? No!

629
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:20,500
It's the deejay. My fave.

630
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:22,300
That dirty thing?

631
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:24,700
Told me you boys got her.

632
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:26,600
Well, yeah.

633
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:29,300
Leatherface killed her
once already tonight.

634
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:32,400
But look, she's red-faced.

635
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:36,300
Bubba's been playing with her.
Bubba likes her.

636
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:39,300
Bubba's got a girlfriend.

637
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:42,000
Bubba's got a girlfriend!
Bubba's got a girlfriend!

638
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,100
Bubba's got a girlfriend!
Bubba's got a girlfriend!

639
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:46,000
Bubba's got a girlfriend!
Bubba's got a girlfriend!

640
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,700
Bubba's got a girl...

641
01:12:49,300 --> 01:12:51,500
Is that what this is, Bubba?

642
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:53,900
The old cock-and-cunt swindle, huh?

643
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:57,900
S-C-E-X. Sex.

644
01:12:57,800 --> 01:13:00,300
And you had to find out about it,
didn't you?

645
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:02,400
You just couldn't leave it alone.

646
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:05,600
If you wanted to know about it so bad,
why didn't you ask me?

647
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:08,400
You wanna know about it?
You wanna know about it?

648
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:10,800
Ask me. Ask me.

649
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:15,000
It's a swindle, that's all.
So don't get mixed up in it.

650
01:13:14,900 --> 01:13:17,000
Help me. Help me.

651
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:18,600
Help me.

652
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:21,200
Please, help me. Please.

653
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:22,100
Help me.

654
01:13:22,300 --> 01:13:23,700
Please, help me.

655
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:30,200
All right, Miss Priss, cut that out.

656
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:32,500
Leave him alone, damn it!

657
01:13:34,900 --> 01:13:38,200
Bubba, you were supposed to finish her.
Finish her now.

658
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:43,400
-Burn her like a rat.
-Finish her.

659
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:44,900
-Burn her like a rat!
-Finish her now.

660
01:13:44,900 --> 01:13:45,700
Burn her like a rat!
Burn her like a rat, rat, rat!

661
01:13:45,700 --> 01:13:48,800
Burn her like a rat!
Burn her like a rat, rat, rat!

662
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:51,400
-Burn her like a rat!
-Finish her now!

663
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:53,000
-Finish her now, Bubba!
-Burn her like a rat!

664
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,200
-Finish her!
-Finish her. Finish her.

665
01:13:56,900 --> 01:13:59,000
Give me that.

666
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:03,100
Turn traitor for a piece of tail.

667
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:07,400
You got one choice, boy, sex or the saw.

668
01:14:08,300 --> 01:14:11,300
Sex is, well, nobody knows.

669
01:14:11,300 --> 01:14:15,000
But the saw, the saw is family.

670
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:19,000
-The saw is family.
-Wait till Granddad hears about this.

671
01:14:22,100 --> 01:14:23,300
Take her away.

672
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:28,600
-She's in the garbage now.
-Oh, no.

673
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:32,900
-Oh, no.
-A-one

674
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,700
and a-two

675
01:14:36,700 --> 01:14:38,100
and three!

676
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:51,100
No!

677
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:59,000
Dinnertime, damn it! Let's go.

678
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,500
Eat and run. Eat and run.

679
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:04,800
There's a lot of hungry football fans
to feed.

680
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:08,200
Hurry it up. Grandpa likes to go fast.

681
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:11,600
He always did. Come on. Come on.

682
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:13,200
Time eats money.

683
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:18,600
Those damn coon shits
are the weight of the family.

684
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:22,900
I stoop my shoulders
taking care of my younger brothers.

685
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:26,900
It squashed the young years out of my life

686
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:29,900
like a can of cheese whip.

687
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:37,800
I wouldn't wish this rotten life off
on a one-eyed ferret with mange.

688
01:15:38,900 --> 01:15:42,900
You're the first girl
Bubba's brought home to dinner.

689
01:15:42,900 --> 01:15:44,800
This is a real special occasion.

690
01:15:45,300 --> 01:15:48,200
Grandpa sure looks forward
to meeting you.

691
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:52,500
He's 137 years old
but still as fast as Jesse James,

692
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:54,600
so don't you worry none.

693
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:56,400
Here comes Grandpa now.

694
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:58,800
God bless you, Grandpa.

695
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:02,400
Oh, it's playtime!
It's dinnertime!

696
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:05,000
Your little boys
have some left here for you.

697
01:16:04,900 --> 01:16:07,400
Yes, no, yes, no!
Yes, we do!

698
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:10,300
We love you!
We love you!

699
01:16:12,700 --> 01:16:15,600
Okay, now. Take it easy, now.
Take it easy with Grandpa.

700
01:16:15,700 --> 01:16:18,100
-That's right. That's right.
-Get him over here easy, now.

701
01:16:18,100 --> 01:16:19,500
-That's right. Okay.
-Come on, you boys.

702
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:22,000
Easy with Grandpa, now.

703
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
-Oh, easy with Grandpa.
-No! No!

704
01:16:24,100 --> 01:16:25,400
Oh, please, no.

705
01:16:26,300 --> 01:16:29,600
Don't rattle him like that, damn it!

706
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:31,500
You're balling up his shit.

707
01:16:34,900 --> 01:16:35,900
No!

708
01:16:35,900 --> 01:16:40,000
Grandpa's strict liquid diet
keeps him as fresh as a rose.

709
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,300
Every spring,

710
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:46,200
the Atlas Rendering Company
used to throw a big barbecue for Grandpa.

711
01:16:46,100 --> 01:16:48,700
Oh, he was the master.

712
01:16:48,700 --> 01:16:50,700
He was the one and only.

713
01:16:50,700 --> 01:16:53,500
He showed us all the business.

714
01:16:53,700 --> 01:16:55,400
We was raised in meat.

715
01:16:56,900 --> 01:17:00,900
But then after the glory,
here comes the shame.

716
01:17:01,100 --> 01:17:03,300
Atlas went for automation.

717
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:06,000
The electrified cages,

718
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:07,700
the cold-steel chutes,

719
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:10,200
the air-powered head hammers.

720
01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:14,000
That drove Grandpa crazy,
seeing things done like that.

721
01:17:13,900 --> 01:17:16,100
Let me go! Let me go!

722
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:19,800
No, no, that's all right. That's all right.
It'll be over soon.

723
01:17:21,900 --> 01:17:23,500
Get the hammer.

724
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:25,700
Get the hammer.

725
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:29,500
The crunching and the grinding,

726
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:31,800
he just couldn't stand it, no way.

727
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:34,200
So that was all she wrote.

728
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:37,800
One morning, Grandpa just quit going in.

729
01:17:38,100 --> 01:17:39,500
It was the shame.

730
01:17:40,100 --> 01:17:43,200
It was the shame. The shame.

731
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:47,300
There's more work to do.
Let's get on with it.

732
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:49,600
Right. Let's get on with it. Bingo!

733
01:17:49,700 --> 01:17:53,300
Give me that.
Get that tub over there in a hurry.

734
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:56,200
Do I have to do every damn thing
around here?

735
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:58,400
You just sit tight.

736
01:17:59,900 --> 01:18:02,900
Bubba, she's ready. Bring her on down.

737
01:18:04,100 --> 01:18:06,100
No!

738
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:11,400
-Oh, no!
-Bring her on down, damn it!

739
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:13,800
No! No!

740
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:15,600
Bring her on down!

741
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:19,100
No! No, no, no!

742
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:21,400
No, no, no!

743
01:18:24,300 --> 01:18:27,200
Help me! No, no, no!

744
01:18:27,300 --> 01:18:31,000
Let me go! You gotta let me go!
Let me go! Please, help me!

745
01:18:30,900 --> 01:18:33,300
-This will be one you won't forget.
-Please, help me!

746
01:18:33,300 --> 01:18:35,100
It's a real honor.

747
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:37,900
Grandpa, he's a one-hitter.

748
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:41,600
And it's just like going home.

749
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:44,400
Please help me!

750
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:47,400
-No! No! No, God!
-No, no.

751
01:18:47,700 --> 01:18:51,000
Help me! Let me go!

752
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:53,300
Let me go! Let me go!

753
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:55,700
Help me, please!

754
01:18:56,500 --> 01:18:58,200
Please, help me!

755
01:18:58,200 --> 01:19:00,300
Let's go see Grandpa, boy.

756
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:01,800
No, don't!

757
01:19:07,900 --> 01:19:11,300
-No! No, God!
-Come on. Bring the bitch down.

758
01:19:11,300 --> 01:19:14,100
No! No! No!

759
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:16,100
No, no, let me go!

760
01:19:16,300 --> 01:19:18,000
Let me go!

761
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:20,700
Let me go! No! No!

762
01:19:20,900 --> 01:19:22,700
No, no, no!

763
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:25,500
No!

764
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:28,400
Here come the judge.
Here come the judge.

765
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:30,200
No!

766
01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:33,300
Now, don't ruin Grandpa's favorite rug.

767
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:37,400
Be careful of the splatter.
You gotta be careful of the splatter.

768
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:41,600
Oh, Great-grandma in chainsaw heaven...

769
01:19:41,500 --> 01:19:42,900
No! No! God!

770
01:19:42,900 --> 01:19:45,300
...please don't hoodoo the boy.

771
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:47,800
Hey, Grandpa, here's the big boy.

772
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:50,300
Look what Bubba brought you.

773
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:54,200
Hey, Grandpa,
Bubba's got something to show you here.

774
01:19:54,100 --> 01:19:56,000
Look, a Slurpee booty.

775
01:19:57,200 --> 01:19:58,900
-Hit her, Grandpa.
-Come on, Grandpa.

776
01:19:58,900 --> 01:20:01,500
Let's see you do it. Now, come on.
Come on, Grandpa. You're the best.

777
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:03,700
-Hit her, Grandpa. Hit her!
-Come on. Hit her, Grandpa.

778
01:20:03,700 --> 01:20:05,400
Come on, I'm telling you...

779
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:08,300
Remember those thieves?
Come on. One-hitter.

780
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:09,800
-Come on, Grandpa.
-Hit her. Hit her, Grandpa.

781
01:20:09,900 --> 01:20:11,800
Come on, you won't miss her.

782
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:21,600
-Come on, Grandpa.
-Come on, Grandpa.

783
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:23,900
Hit her. Hit that bitch. Hit that bitch.

784
01:20:24,100 --> 01:20:25,100
Come on, Grandpa.

785
01:20:25,100 --> 01:20:27,800
Come on, Grandpa. You can do it.
You're the best.

786
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:30,700
Come on, there, Grandpa.
Come on, there, Grandpa.

787
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:33,600
Come on, Grandpa. You can do it.
You're the best.

788
01:20:35,900 --> 01:20:38,100
Hit her, Grandpa.
Come on, Grandpa.

789
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:39,900
You're the best, Grandpa.

790
01:20:39,900 --> 01:20:42,400
Hit that bitch, Grandpa. Hit her.

791
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:45,900
Come on, Grandpa. Hit her.
You are, Grandpa. You're the best.

792
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:48,400
Come on, Grandpa. Hit her.
You are, Grandpa. You're the best.

793
01:20:50,300 --> 01:20:53,600
Yeah!
That's good, isn't it, Grandpa?

794
01:20:57,100 --> 01:20:58,200
Grandpa!

795
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:01,800
-Attaboy, Grandpa.
-Hit that bitch, now, Grandpa.

796
01:21:01,900 --> 01:21:05,200
-Come on, Grandpa. You can do it.
-Get her now, Grandpa. You can do it.

797
01:21:05,100 --> 01:21:06,500
Come on, Grandpa.

798
01:21:08,900 --> 01:21:11,000
No! No! No!

799
01:21:11,300 --> 01:21:14,700
No! No! No! No!

800
01:21:15,100 --> 01:21:17,600
No! No!

801
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:21,300
Hit that bitch. Hit that bitch!

802
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:22,700
Come on, Grandpa!

803
01:21:27,400 --> 01:21:28,800
Come on, Grandpa!

804
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:32,800
Oh, Grandpa, let's get on with it.

805
01:21:34,100 --> 01:21:36,400
All right! Slurpee-booty time!

806
01:22:00,300 --> 01:22:01,500
Oh, shut up!

807
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:05,000
What the hell's going on here?

808
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:38,800
Boys, boys, boys.

809
01:22:39,100 --> 01:22:41,700
What the hell's going on here?

810
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:46,800
Is that the American way of entering
a man's home, singing like that?

811
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:50,900
Oh, I get it. The old pressure game, huh?

812
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:56,700
Boys, you never
should have been doing this.

813
01:22:56,900 --> 01:23:00,600
Who sent you?
Those sissies over at Del-Mar Catering?

814
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:03,700
That chickenshit burrito-man bunch?

815
01:23:04,900 --> 01:23:08,900
Well, I don't care, you hear?
Yeah, that's right.

816
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:10,200
It's a dog-eat-dog world.

817
01:23:10,300 --> 01:23:14,400
And from where I sit,
there just ain't enough damn dogs.

818
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:17,700
If you can't stand the heat,
get out of the damn kitchen.

819
01:23:19,100 --> 01:23:23,800
How much, huh?
Let's make a deal right here.

820
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:26,000
Real cash money.

821
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:29,600
Just you and me, huh?
I don't care who sent you.

822
01:23:29,700 --> 01:23:32,300
I'm the Lord of the Harvest.

823
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:35,800
Who's that? Some new health-food bunch?

824
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:38,800
Come on. Come on.

825
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,400
Is there any money in it, you wanna know?

826
01:23:41,500 --> 01:23:44,000
Yeah, right here. How much, huh?
How much?

827
01:23:48,900 --> 01:23:51,900
-Lefty.
-Sister.

828
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:54,500
Lefty!

829
01:23:55,900 --> 01:23:57,200
Brazos!

830
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:10,600
Run, sister. Run!

831
01:25:42,200 --> 01:25:44,000
Small businessman

832
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:47,900
that always, always, always
gets it in the ass!

833
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:54,700
Sure... Sure took care of my hems.

834
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:56,900
Saved a trip to the hospital.

835
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:03,600
Looks... Looks bad.

836
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:07,400
Sure burned my beads bad on that one.

837
01:26:42,300 --> 01:26:45,200
Maybe it's time to just shut down.

838
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:47,800
Time to shut down the show, yeah.

839
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:51,400
Yeah, pull the plug. Come here, nubbins.

840
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:59,600
Where...
Where's that old "Fuck you, Charlie"?

841
01:27:29,400 --> 01:27:34,000
That little "Just in case, baby"?

842
01:27:34,300 --> 01:27:35,700
Where'd you put it?

843
01:27:37,300 --> 01:27:38,800
Yeah, there it is.

844
01:27:39,100 --> 01:27:44,000
Man... Man builds a good, sturdy trade

845
01:27:44,300 --> 01:27:46,600
by hooking and crooking.

846
01:27:47,700 --> 01:27:49,800
And then, kerplooey!

847
01:27:50,100 --> 01:27:52,900
The gods just kick him right in the balls.

848
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:57,500
Oh, no, not this time.

849
01:28:09,300 --> 01:28:10,900
No! No!

850
01:28:42,900 --> 01:28:46,700
I got the last laugh right here.

851
01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:07,900
Going down, now!

852
01:29:54,900 --> 01:29:56,900
Going down! Going down, now!

853
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:57,300
Here I come, you hog bitch!

854
01:30:57,900 --> 01:31:00,200
You hog bitch!

855
01:31:00,900 --> 01:31:04,200
Dead end, girl. Dead end now.

856
01:31:07,100 --> 01:31:09,200
Dead-end city.

857
01:31:12,700 --> 01:31:14,400
Look at my face.

858
01:31:14,900 --> 01:31:17,700
Look. Look!

859
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:31,400
It's like death eating a cracker,
isn't it?

860
01:31:43,200 --> 01:31:44,300
No!

861
01:31:44,900 --> 01:31:47,400
Get away from her! Get away!

862
01:31:48,500 --> 01:31:50,100
Don't touch her! No!

863
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:52,200
Grandma!

864
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:54,500
No!

865
01:31:55,100 --> 01:31:57,400
Grandma! Grandma!

866
01:31:57,400 --> 01:31:59,200
Grandma!

867
01:32:01,700 --> 01:32:04,000
Grandma!

868
01:32:10,100 --> 01:32:13,800
You killed her, you hog bitch!

869
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:38,700
Die!

870
01:32:39,700 --> 01:32:49,700
