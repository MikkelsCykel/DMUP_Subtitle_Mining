00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:20,093
The usual.
-- Certainly.

17
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:29,728
I have signed something which I hoped
That you can perhaps even to watch.

18

Is there anything on?
-- No.

19
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,859
Your reputation perfect.

20
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:40,614
And your shares ...

21
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:46,036
We can, you can, perhaps
You must invest more.

22
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,957
No, small amounts.
Keep it simply simple.

23
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:02,052
How do you do it?

24
00:05:02,553 --> 00:05:06,723
Sometimes everything is risking the only choice
You use.

25
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:11,854
But it seems that you all
No any chance Ventures.

26
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,815
I was not talking about myself.

27
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:23,448
I am sorry, you are right.
They are all my things.

28
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:28,412
Do not worry that I meerij
On one of your shares, which I would never do.

29
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:32,791
I am not sure. I know
Sure that you never would.

30
00:06:53,831 --> 00:06:56,959
<i> So where does one change
Come ...</ i></i>

That hurts. "

I owed you one.
Back to that girl.

How is it with my nephew? They
By evening, so listen carefully.

35
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:24,736
This case is a real good trade.

36
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:27,948
Achterkamers and everything, so over
Kloten not around, we go inside ...

37
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:30,742
We do our bets, collect the money
And make us away.

38
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:33,161
The kontrolno is already within, he has the name
Of the winning horse.

39
00:07:33,245 --> 00:07:37,249
And understand this well bastards,
The chances are eight to one.

40
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:41,086
That is certain. We meet
Down to seven hours.

41
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:44,214
And keep your heads close, certainly you dick.

42
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:46,800
Do not worry, it works out.

43
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:51,013
What is the name of the winning horse?

44
00:07:51,722 --> 00:07:54,933
Butterfly.

45
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,842
Do you want something?

46
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:14,137
I want some money bets on Butterfly.

47
00:09:15,806 --> 00:09:17,891
At the next race.

48
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:21,645
Can I use it?
-- Sure.

49
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:23,647
How much?

50
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:28,485
Ten, ten thousand dollars.

51
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:37,286
Wait, twenty.

52
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:46,461
What would you think of fifty?

53
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:49,673
Have you so much money for you?

54
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:54,636
Because if you do not, you can always
Borrow something from the house.

55
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,974
I have to see your driving licence.

56
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:03,604
Look even after this.

57
00:10:07,191 --> 00:10:11,069
Vijftigduizend on Butterfly.

58
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:23,790
<i> The horses at the fence. </ I></i>

59
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:27,920
<i> And they are gone. Yello has a head start. </ I></i>

60
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:30,297
<i> Alpha and Santana right behind him. </ I></i>

61
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:34,927
<i> Followed by Shooting Star, Perpetrater,
Butterfly and Silking Accrow </ i>.</i>

62
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:37,346
<i> On the inside Alpha takes the initiative. </ I></i>

63
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:38,847
<i> He is neck to neck with Yello </ i>.</i>

64
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:43,393
<i> Wait, there is Butterfly.
This is unexpected. </ I></i>

65
00:10:43,602 --> 00:10:47,231
<i>He passes  Alpha. Passeert Yello.
Butterfly goes to the leadership. </ I></i>

66
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:51,944
<i> They go into the curve, it's Butterfly
Followed by Alpha and Yello </ i>.</i>

67
00:10:52,736 --> 00:10:55,155
<i> My God, he is </ i>.</i>

68
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:59,993
<i> Butterfly goes down, and Alpha,
Also. What a terrible accident. </ I></i>

69
00:11:00,536 --> 00:11:04,581
<i>And  Yello is about the finish.
Yello wins. </ I></i>

How have you found here?

71
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:54,256
How did you ... I will talk to you.
It is a damned simple question.

72
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:08,187
Jobs you for the police?
-- No.

73
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:10,230
I tried just gambling,
That's all.

74
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,732
You wanted to gambling?

75
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:15,152
Nobody comes here because
They are a bit like gambling.

76
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:18,197
I am sorry, I did not want to run away.
I wanted ...

77
00:12:27,998 --> 00:12:31,960
You have to gewed Butterfly.
-- Yes, that is what I have done.

78
00:12:32,336 --> 00:12:35,297
You knew that kontrolno.
-- No, I ...

79
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:40,511
Lieg not against me. How?

80
00:12:41,011 --> 00:12:44,348
Come on, you knew how,
Kontrolno that?

81
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:49,728
I hear my colleagues talk, and ...

82
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:54,858
I love butterflies.

83
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:59,738
What do you love about?
-- Butterflies.

84

I love butterflies.

He loves butterflies, the name
Butterfly is of the horse, so ...

86
00:13:05,911 --> 00:13:09,957
He comes here and bets on
Kontrolno one.

87
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:13,293
Do you know why I want 'Fingers' call?

88
00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:16,088
Hr. Park knows why they call me Fingers.

89
00:13:16,213 --> 00:13:22,010
He came two weeks ago even though along,
Because he also wanted to gambling.

90
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:25,681
I did not want to run away, I came the money
Get for my sister. I was getting.

91
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:30,102
Lost, and instead of me to pay what
I think he is guilty ...

92
00:13:30,394 --> 00:13:32,437
What does he?

93
00:13:33,981 --> 00:13:36,108
He tries away.
-- I tried not to come away.

94
00:13:36,108 --> 00:13:38,360
I swear it.

95
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:44,449
What is it with you? You come here,
A dumb mistake, what's next?

96
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:47,911
Should I now the bad guy,

I can not for that damned opera, I must
To come here and the bad guy?

98

Do you think I like it?
-- I do not know.

99
00:13:57,921 --> 00:14:01,717
Well, I think this is not fun, it
Guys like you ...

00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:05,095
And you Hr. Park ...

101
00:14:11,185 --> 00:14:14,104
You let me simply no choice.

102
00:14:14,438 --> 00:14:17,816
You have a choice.
My sister has the money.

103
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,334
You have two weeks to give me the money.

104
00:14:35,334 --> 00:14:38,337
Every day that you are too late, cutting
I need a finger.

105
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:01,068
Go somewhere you go?

106
00:15:05,656 --> 00:15:08,158
You are in the pack.

107
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:12,371
No, I am not.
-- Sit down.

108
00:15:16,834 --> 00:15:20,128
You walk away for Fingers, or not?

109
00:15:26,844 --> 00:15:29,054
You have a nice house, a good job ...

110

Where you are good at, and you throw
It all away. Why?

111
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:37,271
Please, I do not know.
-- Why are you doing this?

112
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:41,066
I do not know. I was dumb,
I thought not after.

Why are you doing this?

Why are you doing this?

Yes, you know.
-- No, I do not know.

That is all I can give you.

What should I do with it?

<i> Play it often enough, and you know
All the movements. </ I></i>

152
00:23:58,105 --> 00:24:01,191
<i> And therefore what the future
Written ...</ i></i>

153
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:04,736
<i> I can not change. </ I></i>

154
00:24:09,783 --> 00:24:12,995
<i> And sometimes the things that you do not
Change can ...</ i></i>

155
00:24:13,287 --> 00:24:15,581
<i> Ending there that they get to you. </ I></i>

156
00:24:20,377 --> 00:24:25,090
Fingers, he listens to you.
Talk to him, please.

157
00:24:25,549 --> 00:24:29,720
I have seen what's going to happen with you.
Nothing can change that.

158
00:24:39,646 --> 00:24:42,191
It is done.
-- Well, I want you pick up someone ...

159
00:24:42,274 --> 00:24:44,860
At the airport.
-- I know it.

160
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:50,115
My father, the home affairs
Good for each other, but I want the world to see.

161
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,328
My uncle Fingers, wild
The family. The wealth sharing, you know.

162
00:24:54,578 --> 00:24:57,581
You know how he is to that nickname Fingers
? People do something for him ...

163
00:24:57,664 --> 00:25:00,584
He just put on his fingers
To be cut, that's all.

164
00:25:00,709 --> 00:25:05,255
Great nickname.
Just with his fingers cut.

165
00:25:05,756 --> 00:25:09,551
My uncle is cool, but I am here
Only one thing.

166
00:25:09,927 --> 00:25:11,803
Kutjes.

167
00:25:12,513 --> 00:25:16,517
You know what I say?
I want to fuck tonight.

168
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:27,611
I heard that my favorite uncle
Here.

169
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:32,533
How are you?
-- How is it Tony? Good to see you.

170
00:25:33,867 --> 00:25:35,953
That is the nephew of the boss.

171
00:25:36,036 --> 00:25:39,039
That is damned big.

172
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:43,377
What kind of person is he?
-- Can express themselves well.

173
00:25:43,627 --> 00:25:47,965
Did my men ensured good for you?
-- Yes, we are going to the city.

174
00:25:49,299 --> 00:25:51,677
A young man must refresh its oil.

175
00:25:52,219 --> 00:25:54,137
Listen to me ...

176
00:25:56,139 --> 00:25:59,351
Your father wants you your virginity that I
Let lose, you show how it works.

177
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:03,355
There is enough time to use your dick
To wave, but we must make time for ...

178
00:26:06,066 --> 00:26:08,026
Affairs.
-- Exactly.

179
00:26:08,151 --> 00:26:10,863
No running joke, okay.

180
00:26:12,656 --> 00:26:16,076
Would you take Tony tonight on your rounds?
The city show, show what we do?

181
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:19,163
Beginning with his training.
Him company.

182
00:26:21,248 --> 00:26:24,459
Sure.
-- Good then.

183
00:26:24,543 --> 00:26:28,005
Stay out of trouble.
Think of the last time.

184
00:26:29,006 --> 00:26:32,301
Adrea No more, I swear it.
-- It is now funny.

185
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:36,847
Do you get away. Go out,
I have things to discuss.

186
00:26:37,431 --> 00:26:39,474
I can see you later.

187
00:26:47,357 --> 00:26:49,693
He is a damn problem.

188
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:52,362
Make sure he is not in trouble.
Perhaps he still learns something.

189
00:26:52,446 --> 00:26:56,408
But now it's time for business.

190
00:26:57,534 --> 00:26:59,411
You can listen to.

191
00:27:19,806 --> 00:27:23,143
What do you think?
-- It is good.

192
00:27:23,727 --> 00:27:27,856
Sorry? It is damned amazing.
What are you talking about?

193
00:27:28,065 --> 00:27:30,234
I do not know a lot of music.

194
00:27:30,651 --> 00:27:32,903
A customer of mine, which are debt
Paid to me ...

195
00:27:32,903 --> 00:27:35,614
A portion of the deal
Was its management's contract.

196
00:27:35,739 --> 00:27:40,327
This is her first CD. The sale,
Increases through the roof. Many promising.

197
00:27:40,661 --> 00:27:43,080
I am sorry, I can still
Not follow.

198
00:27:44,581 --> 00:27:47,751
How long do we do this already?

199
00:27:48,669 --> 00:27:51,630
Too long. I am tired of order behind
The money to hunt.

200
00:27:51,713 --> 00:27:56,301
I am tired of lessons to nietsnutten
Learning, which do not want to pay.

201
00:27:59,513 --> 00:28:04,017
I have always hoped for more.
For us both.

202
00:28:07,271 --> 00:28:08,981
This girl is our way up.

203
00:28:09,064 --> 00:28:13,527
I am sure that it is evil, if they
Discovered that I am her new manager, but ...

204
00:28:13,652 --> 00:28:17,781
Count because I do it.
Let you but her.

205
00:28:20,868 --> 00:28:23,620
What is it? What do you see?

206
00:28:24,872 --> 00:28:26,957
Nothing.

207
00:28:27,541 --> 00:28:30,919
You see something.
-- I see nothing.

208
00:28:30,961 --> 00:28:33,172
What do you mean?
Did they have no future?

209
00:28:33,255 --> 00:28:38,218
It does have a future,
But I can not see.

210
00:28:48,145 --> 00:28:50,564
You do not talk much, huh?

211
00:28:51,899 --> 00:28:54,735
Too busy to think of the future
I would bet.

212
00:28:55,152 --> 00:28:57,946
My uncle has told me that you
The future can see, and so forth.

213
00:28:58,071 --> 00:29:02,701
He says, the money, the casinos
The stock market. You know everything.

214
00:29:03,076 --> 00:29:05,913
Do you know where that reminds me?
Have you ever seen that movie, Krull?

215
00:29:06,246 --> 00:29:07,956
Since that plays Cyclop in ...

216
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:11,919
And it is so, because he is an eye
Had exchange for the future.

217
00:29:12,169 --> 00:29:14,296
But a long story short ...

218
00:29:23,931 --> 00:29:27,601
Came the evil warlord
Deceived that bastard ...

219
00:29:27,726 --> 00:29:30,687
And the only future that he could see
Was his own death.

220
00:29:30,812 --> 00:29:34,233
Man, that was zanie.

221
00:29:34,942 --> 00:29:37,945
What's the plan tonight?

222
00:29:38,362 --> 00:29:42,908
Are we getting something to drink first,
Or is it immediately ...

223
00:29:42,991 --> 00:29:45,494
To the pussies.
-- Tonight we work.

224
00:29:56,129 --> 00:29:59,383
He's not.
Come back next week but.

225
00:30:04,638 --> 00:30:08,433
He is in the hospital.
There is a mole removed by him.

226
00:30:09,643 --> 00:30:12,312
Come back next week.

227
00:30:16,066 --> 00:30:18,652
Do you like that, baby?

228
00:30:19,486 --> 00:30:22,156
I have told you, next week.

229
00:30:22,739 --> 00:30:25,534
No, you will now pay old tart.

230
00:30:25,659 --> 00:30:28,912
Otherwise we go into the bunch
Still a little verkloten.

231
00:30:46,763 --> 00:30:48,932
Dude.

232
00:30:49,683 --> 00:30:53,270
Why you helped me, I
There was sewn by Moby Dick.

233
00:30:53,353 --> 00:30:58,108
What do you think, we go back?
Shall we die together trut rams?

234
00:30:58,609 --> 00:31:01,403
Where did they damn well?

235
00:31:21,131 --> 00:31:23,300
I am not.

236
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,938
Are you at the bleeding?
-- I do not know.

237
00:31:37,231 --> 00:31:39,149
Sta.

238
00:31:40,067 --> 00:31:43,946
Let me give you even more time.
I come back next week.

239
00:31:44,571 --> 00:31:47,241
I want to see the money you have.
Or make sure the Fingers.

240
00:31:47,324 --> 00:31:51,495
Because if he does not get,
He takes one of these.

241
00:31:51,912 --> 00:31:54,206
You do not want to.

242
00:31:55,415 --> 00:31:59,545
I see you next week,
I am sorry of the message.

243
00:32:01,088 --> 00:32:02,881
Let's go.

244
00:32:18,856 --> 00:32:23,235
I have never seen such thing.
Verdomde cold ruthless junk.

245
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:28,574
You knew that there was trut.
How's that? What do you see?

246
00:32:30,784 --> 00:32:34,329
Enjoy you?
People so to beat each other?

247
00:32:34,621 --> 00:32:38,125
Sometimes hear that work.
-- Yes, but you enjoy it?

248
00:32:38,709 --> 00:32:41,795
I think you do.
I think you do in life.

249
00:32:42,713 --> 00:32:46,842
Yes, it is done. Otherwise you do foreplay
The lottery, and that makes you here.

250
00:32:47,342 --> 00:32:49,553
I can not.

251
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:53,640
How come, that you can not? You are
As a man who does what he is like.

252
00:32:53,974 --> 00:32:58,228
I can not do that because it is not
Shown to me.

253
00:32:58,562 --> 00:33:01,440
At the time that I see,
I go by.

254
00:33:06,236 --> 00:33:08,405
So you can ...

255
00:33:09,239 --> 00:33:13,660
You can launch any girl fuck, and you know
Sure you are not sewn.

256
00:33:15,996 --> 00:33:19,708
Safe sex is something great,
I have heard that at least.

257
00:33:49,363 --> 00:33:51,740
That is my dream there.
Let me exactly where something like this.

258
00:33:52,032 --> 00:33:55,744
Music, chicks that fuck each other, while
Another brill to my balls sucks.

259
00:33:55,828 --> 00:33:58,455
Why are we not first
Go afterwards?

260
00:34:01,124 --> 00:34:02,960
It has a lot with him,
As an old man.

261
00:34:03,043 --> 00:34:05,420
Hello, boys.

262
00:34:05,712 --> 00:34:09,007
It is fine for you to see.
As always.

263
00:34:10,384 --> 00:34:15,347
This is Tony, nephew of Fingers.
-- Hello, how are you?

264
00:34:15,973 --> 00:34:19,643
I love you uncle, he is a lovely man.
Have you had anything to drink?

265
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:23,105
I have a bit of a program ...

266
00:34:23,981 --> 00:34:26,233
Got a flat?
-- Enough time to stay.

267
00:34:26,316 --> 00:34:29,862
That can always say, but I know
It is not true.

268
00:34:30,404 --> 00:34:32,948
Whatever you want, ask for
Just about.

269
00:34:32,948 --> 00:34:37,578
Follow us but.
-- Tony is not so easy.

270
00:34:38,328 --> 00:34:40,706
Let us clothes off.

271
00:34:40,998 --> 00:34:42,708
Where is the room?

272
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:49,756
That old man there ...
-- He and his men were regular customers.

273
00:34:51,675 --> 00:34:53,594
They do not share their pistols.

274
00:34:53,677 --> 00:34:56,054
Has he a gun?
-- He alone, nobody else.

275
00:34:56,138 --> 00:34:59,099
You pay for the protection
Of Fingers.

276
00:35:00,184 --> 00:35:03,270
That is worth every cent.

277
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:09,401
You know that you are always welcome
To stay.

278
00:35:12,112 --> 00:35:16,450
I am not a hostess more,
Just as I do that themselves prefer.

279
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:22,331
Can you do something for me?
-- Everything.

280
00:35:22,498 --> 00:35:26,585
Say that I am against Tony after my rounds
Come back.

281
00:35:28,086 --> 00:35:30,214
Sure.

282
00:35:40,224 --> 00:35:44,228
<i> If you can see the future,
So you think that you can change. </ I></i>

283
00:35:45,062 --> 00:35:47,439
<i> But you are only a witness
Of the moments that are going ...</ i></i>

284
00:35:47,564 --> 00:35:51,610
<i> Not in a position to help, even though
Would you want to. </ I></i>

285
00:35:52,027 --> 00:35:54,905
<i> And maybe you do not. </ I></i>

286
00:35:55,948 --> 00:35:59,618
<i> Sometimes you think that you assumed
Is something to learn. </ I></i>

287
00:36:01,411 --> 00:36:04,498
<i>About  patience or remote storage. </ I></i>

288
00:36:04,915 --> 00:36:07,000
<i> But at the end, it all
About discipline. </ I></i>

289
00:36:07,084 --> 00:36:11,630
<i>Things  see that you do not always want. </ I></i>

290
00:36:12,422 --> 00:36:14,967
<i>And  through. </ I></i>

291
00:36:18,846 --> 00:36:22,808
<i> After a while, the things easier. </ I></i>

292
00:36:24,768 --> 00:36:28,897
<i> Routine ensures that you do not
Wanders into your head. </ I></i>

293
00:36:35,696 --> 00:36:39,283
<i> You start to accept things
As they are. </ I></i>

294
00:36:51,128 --> 00:36:54,923
<i> Every man has his fate. </ I></i>

295
00:36:56,133 --> 00:37:00,554
<i> You can not escape,
Even if you see it coming. </ I></i>

296
00:37:25,746 --> 00:37:27,956
Come on, baby.

297
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,081
Come on, rot.

298
00:38:09,164 --> 00:38:12,167
You are in the wrong room.

299
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:16,839
Touch me not to damn.

300
00:38:16,922 --> 00:38:20,884
Come on, that you should not do.
-- Tell me what I should do.

301
00:38:23,554 --> 00:38:26,139
We had just as a fun time ...

302
00:38:26,473 --> 00:38:28,600
So go away.

303
00:38:28,725 --> 00:38:31,270
Quietly.

304
00:38:39,278 --> 00:38:42,156
Give that damned pistol.
You are wrong, this is not my fault.

305
00:38:42,281 --> 00:38:44,032
Let that damned pistol.

306
00:38:44,116 --> 00:38:46,535
It is not my fault that gun
Just went off.

307
00:38:46,577 --> 00:38:49,621
Then there is nothing for you to worry about it.
-- Do not closer.

308
00:38:49,955 --> 00:38:53,041
I use this damn ga
Backwards.

309
00:38:53,584 --> 00:38:55,752
Do you shoot all of us?

310
00:39:30,871 --> 00:39:33,457
I have done nothing.

311
00:39:53,602 --> 00:39:57,147
What should we do, you have the gun.
-- No, no massacre today.

312
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:15,541
What did you damn plan.

313
00:40:15,582 --> 00:40:18,335
<i> After a while, there is that effort
When you know that it's going to happen. </ I></i>

314
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:21,755
<i> We look at people
Moving slightly intention </ i>.</i>

315
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:26,468
<i> Or is it like to watch a movie,
When you know how it ends? </ I></i>

316
00:40:31,098 --> 00:40:34,685
<i> And then something happens that I
Will never forget. </ I></i>

317
00:40:41,108 --> 00:40:43,235
<i> I am wrong. </ I></i>

318
00:40:43,527 --> 00:40:45,988
<i> For the first time, the confidence
A detour. </ I></i>

319
00:40:46,071 --> 00:40:50,200
<i> And I see a glimpse of something strange
And new. </ I></i>

320
00:40:54,955 --> 00:40:58,500
<i> A future where everything
Can happen. </ I></i>

321
00:40:58,834 --> 00:41:01,378
<i> It is something good. </ I></i>

322
00:41:01,712 --> 00:41:04,423
<i> And the feeling that it gives me ...</ i></i>

323
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:07,676
<i> Comes closest to what
I have ever felt ...</ i></i>

324
00:41:11,221 --> 00:41:14,016
<i> With pleasure. </ I></i>

325
00:41:28,739 --> 00:41:32,201
Sir, can you tell me what
There with you happened.

326
00:41:32,826 --> 00:41:35,370
I do not know. Tell me
It.

327
00:41:50,636 --> 00:41:53,013
That's my boy.

328
00:42:02,773 --> 00:42:06,318
I appreciate what you Tony
Already.

329
00:42:10,447 --> 00:42:13,367
How is it that you do not
Have to see.

330
00:42:14,701 --> 00:42:17,704
Do not worry about it but.
Make sure you just better.

331
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:20,249
You have to go back.

332
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,586
I need you.

333
00:42:25,879 --> 00:42:30,133
The boys who have done this with you,
I shall account checkout.

334
00:42:30,467 --> 00:42:34,513
Nobody treats my boy Sun,
Nobody.

335
00:42:37,391 --> 00:42:42,980
Chaos, rubbish, panic on the streets.
Your work here is done.

336
00:42:47,901 --> 00:42:49,987
Thanks.

337
00:42:52,906 --> 00:42:57,369
Do not worry. The pussies will
Surely in the row for you.

338
00:42:58,328 --> 00:43:01,123
Girls like scars.

339
00:43:02,124 --> 00:43:05,627
Just as a road map
For the soul.

340
00:43:08,839 --> 00:43:12,843
<i> It is a new day, and I have no idea
What I should expect. </ I></i>

341
00:43:13,427 --> 00:43:17,639
<i> I can change someone's life
If I do sense in it. The worse. </ I></i>

342
00:43:19,433 --> 00:43:21,685
<i>Of  better. </ I></i>

343
00:43:23,437 --> 00:43:26,106
<i> That, I know. </ I></i>

344
00:43:37,576 --> 00:43:40,662
<i> A girl with a future that I do not
Can see, my life. </ I></i>

345
00:43:40,787 --> 00:43:45,876
<i> On the same day that my visions me
For the first time in the lurch left. </ I></i>

346
00:43:48,795 --> 00:43:52,674
<i> There are people who believe in coincidences. </ I></i>

347
00:43:53,217 --> 00:43:55,886
<i> But I am not one of them. </ I></i>

348
00:44:07,648 --> 00:44:09,191
This is old cake, he.

349
00:44:09,191 --> 00:44:13,904
Every ten minutes there will be another boy
Like me, you the same questions.

350
00:44:14,488 --> 00:44:15,948
That belongs to my work.

351
00:44:16,031 --> 00:44:19,034
I promise you that I will try
To make it interesting.

352
00:44:19,117 --> 00:44:22,371
For me it is a question to ask,
That nobody else.

353
00:44:22,496 --> 00:44:26,458
Nobody? -- Nobody.
-- You must trust me. It seems to be good.

354
00:44:26,542 --> 00:44:29,127
You are loved.
-- Forty seconds. -- Included.

355
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,672
Frank is here.
-- Where?

356
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:35,551
What does he.
-- It must be your agenda.

357
00:44:36,927 --> 00:44:40,055
Trista, thank you here today
Wanted to come with me.

358
00:44:40,138 --> 00:44:42,474
I do everything for you.

359
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:46,645
Your first album, which gives you weather
As a great new talent.

360
00:44:47,187 --> 00:44:49,523
Is there pressure? Try you to the excessive
Media attention to compensation.

361
00:44:49,648 --> 00:44:53,193
It is not excessive media attention,
I am not just a pretty face.

362
00:44:53,318 --> 00:44:57,865
I have something to say, and I am so
Excited that my fans want to hear.

363
00:44:57,990 --> 00:45:02,369
Okay, but what difference you and with all those
Other songs beyond?

364
00:45:02,703 --> 00:45:05,539
I think it is my musical influence.
If you go back ...

365
00:45:05,664 --> 00:45:09,001
What I mean is, you are young,
You are beautiful. I see you dancing ...

366
00:45:09,209 --> 00:45:11,044
Why should we care that something can?

367
00:45:11,128 --> 00:45:15,424
I mean, what's yours
That is so special?

368
00:45:17,551 --> 00:45:20,137
What makes me special?
-- Yes.

369
00:45:21,889 --> 00:45:24,433
Nothing.
-- Nothing?

370
00:45:24,516 --> 00:45:27,477
Bedoel you, what makes me better
Than all the others?

371
00:45:27,811 --> 00:45:29,980
No, not better, but ...

372
00:45:32,065 --> 00:45:34,359
Why you earn that?

373
00:45:36,403 --> 00:45:38,864
Why do I do that?

374
00:45:46,163 --> 00:45:47,956
What do you say here?
-- What does he?

375
00:45:47,956 --> 00:45:49,833
She is doing well.
-- I call it K.P.A.B.

376
00:45:49,958 --> 00:45:54,338
Almost nobody has that.
That is the gift of God.

377
00:45:55,005 --> 00:45:59,426
That, and I sing and dance well enough,
Millions of fans with them.

378
00:46:00,344 --> 00:46:03,096
It is something of hundred thousand more.

379
00:46:05,682 --> 00:46:09,186
What else.
That makes not much difference.

380
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:14,650
I have fans who call my name
I also Ga.

381
00:46:15,108 --> 00:46:19,279
Come on, Trista. They do not call
Even your real name.

382
00:46:19,404 --> 00:46:22,533
Right?
-- What?

383
00:46:23,283 --> 00:46:27,204
I mean, can you at least we
Not even your real name?

384
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:32,417
That I will never tell.
-- What do you think of my name?

385
00:46:32,543 --> 00:46:36,713
We have each other now met three times.
Three different interviews, you say ...

386
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:39,258
Everything you do for me.

387
00:46:40,467 --> 00:46:42,594
What is I?

388
00:46:43,136 --> 00:46:44,721
We are ready.

389
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:48,725
Quietly, what is the problem?
What do I do? -- You.

390
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:53,564
That bastard will be on Thursday,
By the time I am finished with him.

391
00:46:53,689 --> 00:46:57,442
Bring me home.
-- We have that, we have a meeting.

392
00:46:57,568 --> 00:46:59,653
Take me in your leg?

393
00:46:59,736 --> 00:47:03,740
Do not worry, it's studio at ten.
It will be soon.

394
00:47:04,533 --> 00:47:08,996
Well, let dad on his wonderful Fingers
Blue eyes.

395
00:47:09,079 --> 00:47:12,499
That man has nothing against you, child.

396
00:47:15,669 --> 00:47:18,839
Fingers, what do you think.
Lives a dream, or not?

397
00:47:19,673 --> 00:47:22,009
You have destroyed my broadcast, Frank.

398
00:47:23,677 --> 00:47:25,179
It is a pleasure working with you
To meet.

399
00:47:25,262 --> 00:47:30,475
Fingers, that's cute. Should I now
If you ask why they call it?

400
00:47:31,351 --> 00:47:35,105
I think that if I use talk
I already have my hands a lot.

401
00:47:37,441 --> 00:47:40,402
You are Trista, right?
-- Yes.

402
00:47:41,528 --> 00:47:44,448
Now we are friends,
We are down to business.

403
00:47:45,532 --> 00:47:47,784
Of course, Trista things go great ...

404
00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:51,038
Be rotated singles, albums
Start to sell ...

405
00:47:51,121 --> 00:47:56,543
The video is often broadcast, but there is
A big difference between a video on MTV ...

406
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:00,797
And between an artist whose headlines
Say that they are nice.

407
00:48:01,131 --> 00:48:03,800
As Frank says, is that someone you need,
You to the next level.

408
00:48:03,884 --> 00:48:06,512
Someone who opens doors.
Someone who is strong.

409
00:48:06,637 --> 00:48:08,972
You resigns.
-- No, I do not resign.

410
00:48:09,097 --> 00:48:14,895
I would step aside. A person
Its influence can be a superstar yours.

411
00:48:15,729 --> 00:48:19,858
He asks for things, and people give
To him. Please.

412
00:48:21,902 --> 00:48:25,489
I love to work with you.
I am totally committed to me your success.

413
00:48:25,489 --> 00:48:27,282
And the only thing I ask is,
You can bet for me.

414
00:48:27,658 --> 00:48:30,494
That is our appointment, that is our promise
We make each other.

415
00:48:30,619 --> 00:48:34,081
When someone our way ...

416
00:48:35,082 --> 00:48:38,210
Then I rule that.
-- I believe this damn not.

417
00:48:38,502 --> 00:48:42,130
Line a car for me. -- Trista, baby.
Fuck you, Frank.

418
00:48:48,011 --> 00:48:52,182
That was not so good.
-- That went very well.

419
00:48:58,605 --> 00:49:02,568
Tomorrow we enjoy shopping.

420
00:49:02,693 --> 00:49:06,363
You are still under contract.
-- Rot with contracts.

421
00:49:07,364 --> 00:49:11,243
I think I go.
Can you continue with her?

422
00:49:14,454 --> 00:49:16,832
I am back tomorrow.

423
00:49:25,632 --> 00:49:29,136
I am tired.
-- Yes.

424
00:49:36,059 --> 00:49:39,396
Do you love me, Danny?
-- Of course I do that.

425
00:49:40,481 --> 00:49:43,233
I also love you.

426
00:49:45,986 --> 00:49:49,323
Remove the light at?

427
00:49:50,073 --> 00:49:52,826
I do not like the dark.

428
00:50:00,417 --> 00:50:03,128
The girl is not nervous, do you?

429
00:50:04,755 --> 00:50:10,093
Do not worry. After school
I am here to wait on you, okay?

430
00:51:17,995 --> 00:51:21,123
Your friends will not help
You know that?

431
00:51:22,749 --> 00:51:27,087
No one will help you.
Nobody, but I do.

432
00:51:27,921 --> 00:51:33,093
Your manager has all your accounts
Leeggehaald for me to pay back.

433
00:51:33,844 --> 00:51:36,180
And that little piece of paper, which is
That you are the property are ...

434
00:51:36,263 --> 00:51:39,099
Is the only thing that prevents
That he remains alive.

435
00:51:39,224 --> 00:51:45,647
And what does that mean? That means
You have nothing.

436
00:51:46,356 --> 00:51:50,235
And you are nothing, until I say.
And you are on tour ...

437
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:55,407
And you still travel,
Until I see profits.

438
00:51:55,949 --> 00:51:59,119
And if I should ever come back,
We have a totally different conversation.

439
00:51:59,203 --> 00:52:01,538
Understand you me?

440
00:52:33,237 --> 00:52:35,364
Proost.

441
00:52:48,418 --> 00:52:50,504
Do you not think you have had enough?

442
00:52:50,629 --> 00:52:55,092
No, I think it is hardly enough.

443
00:52:56,510 --> 00:52:59,638
It may not be as bad as you think.

444
00:53:01,431 --> 00:53:05,519
You must be tired from it, to name
To have no idea of what you talk.

445
00:53:08,188 --> 00:53:11,817
Where was you actually, when Frank
Me at the sewing?

446
00:53:12,526 --> 00:53:16,488
Did you?
Hielp you him?

447
00:53:17,406 --> 00:53:22,411
No, of course not.
I am your girlfriend.

448
00:53:24,121 --> 00:53:26,790
Remind you your ...

449
00:53:27,791 --> 00:53:31,920
How much it pays again
For my girlfriend to be?

450
00:53:36,049 --> 00:53:38,552
Alison, wait.

451
00:53:39,011 --> 00:53:42,347
Who will pay for the drinks?
-- I referred to it not the case, come on.

452
00:53:59,323 --> 00:54:04,912
Alison, wait damn. Come on.

453
00:54:10,167 --> 00:54:14,254
Are you Trista? -- What?
Are you Trista? -- No.

454
00:54:14,421 --> 00:54:16,298
Yes, you do.
-- No.

455
00:54:16,423 --> 00:54:18,634
Can I get a signature.
-- Sure.

456
00:54:18,717 --> 00:54:21,929
For Jake 'the hotty. "
-- Sure.

457
00:54:22,054 --> 00:54:24,515
Trista, my sister loves you.
-- I love your sister.

458
00:54:24,515 --> 00:54:26,975
You were great last.
-- Thank you.

459
00:54:32,022 --> 00:54:34,399
That hurts, damn.
-- Another photo.

460
00:54:34,858 --> 00:54:36,318
Take a picture.

461
00:56:08,202 --> 00:56:11,079
So I can leave?
-- Sure.

462
00:56:11,121 --> 00:56:14,249
What are you going to do?
Where will you go?

463
00:56:18,462 --> 00:56:21,840
There will be something to overcome.

464
00:56:21,924 --> 00:56:25,344
You are now Fingers his possession.

465
00:56:26,303 --> 00:56:29,556
He will do you edit you are exhausted.

466
00:56:30,057 --> 00:56:33,644
Jou throw away, which is what he does.

467
00:56:35,229 --> 00:56:37,981
What imagine that I must do.

468
00:56:39,566 --> 00:56:44,738
Fingers If you know that the legs,
He will come after you hunt.

469
00:56:50,744 --> 00:56:56,124
The only place where he will not come
Search, is here.

470
00:56:57,501 --> 00:57:00,629
I can see some money together to get ...

471
00:57:00,712 --> 00:57:06,635
And then you can go far enough away with it,
Fingers can even order not to deal with them.

472
00:57:11,181 --> 00:57:14,017
Why you help me?

473
00:57:18,856 --> 00:57:21,191
I do not know.

474
00:57:24,361 --> 00:57:27,030
That let me just disappear.

475
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:33,120
As long as I can remember ...

476
00:57:34,705 --> 00:57:38,834
I myself have never let something ...

477
00:57:40,294 --> 00:57:43,005
Want.

478
00:57:44,131 --> 00:57:46,633
Stay away from windows, and ...

479
00:57:47,134 --> 00:57:50,470
Suit but all you need
From the kitchen.

480
00:57:50,971 --> 00:57:55,350
Tap nothing else.

481
00:59:51,425 --> 00:59:54,595
Is all well with you?
-- Yes.

482
00:59:55,179 --> 00:59:58,599
I am doing fine, it's just work.

483
00:59:58,932 --> 01:00:02,227
What have you done today?

484
01:00:05,105 --> 01:00:07,774
I have searched for you.

485
01:00:13,447 --> 01:00:17,618
I like what you here
Already.

486
01:00:17,868 --> 01:00:21,830
For us, as we here for a while.

487
01:00:24,875 --> 01:00:28,170
Who's that, in this picture
Together with you?

488
01:00:28,712 --> 01:00:31,423
Sparky.

489
01:00:32,049 --> 01:00:34,843
Were you well with each other?
-- Yes.

490
01:00:36,970 --> 01:00:39,389
That we went, it is ...

491
01:00:41,475 --> 01:00:44,019
He died.

492
01:00:51,485 --> 01:00:53,987
What happened?

493
01:00:58,992 --> 01:01:01,745
I saw it coming, and ...

494
01:01:05,332 --> 01:01:09,628
I could do nothing to halt.

495
01:01:10,087 --> 01:01:12,881
I know how that feels.

496
01:01:15,843 --> 01:01:21,139
It feels as if you never
Will be something like ...

497
01:01:22,099 --> 01:01:24,685
Feel.

498
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:37,197
Therefore, I have more scars.

499
01:01:41,201 --> 01:01:45,664
You know that the road map scars
To the soul.

500
01:03:01,949 --> 01:03:06,453
It's been a few weeks ago, I thought
Perhaps we could make a ride?

501
01:03:06,870 --> 01:03:08,872
Tomorrow?

502
01:03:08,956 --> 01:03:11,250
You go away?
-- Yes.

503
01:03:14,711 --> 01:03:17,923
What do you have in your hand?
-- Nothing.

504
01:03:18,715 --> 01:03:21,176
Something that I think that I have seen.

505
01:03:21,468 --> 01:03:24,555
It's not what you think.
-- What should you do?

506
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:27,850
Do not worry about it.
It is for a friend.

507
01:03:45,993 --> 01:03:47,953
<i> With whom I speak? </ I></i>

508
01:04:21,778 --> 01:04:23,906
Piece shit.

509
01:04:29,870 --> 01:04:33,081
Three weeks, we are already looking
To that slut. Three weeks.

510
01:04:33,207 --> 01:04:36,251
Rondvragen, heads together,
You at my side ...

511
01:04:36,251 --> 01:04:39,004
And all that time she was here with you.

512
01:04:41,798 --> 01:04:44,885
You would think that for you to death
Abandoned impaired idiot ...

513
01:04:44,968 --> 01:04:48,305
That you had shown some mercy to those
Poor bastard, and had told me the truth ...

514
01:04:48,430 --> 01:04:52,351
But no, you stood there and looked.

515
01:04:53,977 --> 01:04:58,315
You are a cold my friend,
A damned cold.

516
01:05:01,985 --> 01:05:06,240
What is this? Do you have something to put aside
Your little lady to take along on vacation?

517
01:05:07,991 --> 01:05:11,119
Is that yours?
I thought it not?

518
01:05:12,412 --> 01:05:14,706
Leave me alone.

519
01:05:17,835 --> 01:05:19,962
What's going on with you?

520
01:05:21,421 --> 01:05:24,758
In the past you had seen it coming.

521
01:05:27,261 --> 01:05:29,888
You lose the feeling.

522
01:05:33,684 --> 01:05:36,603
Say you anything against me?
Are you trying to say something to me?

523
01:05:36,728 --> 01:05:41,191
You put me in this situation.

524
01:05:48,198 --> 01:05:51,910
Do you think I am a bad guy.

525
01:05:52,452 --> 01:05:56,999
I will talk to you.
I am not a bad guy.

526
01:05:59,877 --> 01:06:02,754
I want what everyone wants.

527
01:06:29,907 --> 01:06:32,951
I try everything.
What happens? What do you benefit?

528
01:06:33,076 --> 01:06:36,371
That was not enough for you.
That was not enough, you wanted more.

529
01:06:36,497 --> 01:06:39,374
You have all the love of the world,
But that's not enough for you.

530
01:06:39,458 --> 01:06:43,587
So you took my friend, and put him
Against me. And then?

531
01:06:43,670 --> 01:06:46,298
You self piece of shit.

532
01:06:49,176 --> 01:06:51,386
I think ...

533
01:06:53,430 --> 01:06:56,600
That you do not know what's for you
To be about.

534
01:07:45,399 --> 01:07:47,901
Tell me ...

535
01:07:47,985 --> 01:07:50,696
What should I tell you?

536
01:07:51,071 --> 01:07:54,366
Your real name.

537
01:08:52,633 --> 01:08:56,053
The case is closed, you must skirt.
-- You must let me inside.

538
01:08:56,553 --> 01:08:59,348
You do not understand.
I am a doctor.

539
01:08:59,890 --> 01:09:04,019
You have to the front.
-- There is somebody dead. I must Trista.

540
01:09:05,938 --> 01:09:07,481
I must Trista.

541
01:09:07,481 --> 01:09:11,026
Come on man, I am a doctor.

542
01:09:11,652 --> 01:09:15,197
If she dies, it is your fault.

543
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:16,740
<i> Everyone has a purpose. </ I></i>

544
01:09:16,865 --> 01:09:21,119
<i> Sometimes someone lives his entire life without
To know what his own. </ I></i>

545
01:09:21,328 --> 01:09:23,872
<i> I do not. I knew it when I was ten. </ I></i>

546
01:09:28,001 --> 01:09:32,589
<i> My goal is to the right person
To keep sacred and accurate. </ I></i>

547
01:09:33,924 --> 01:09:37,719
<i> When I was ten, was one
Heidi Fontell </ i>.</i>

548
01:09:41,682 --> 01:09:44,143
<i> But when Heidi's father with his family
Was moving ...</ i></i>

549
01:09:44,226 --> 01:09:48,397
<i> Knew I sure am back of someone
Went. And fast. </ I></i>

550
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:52,568
<i> I was wrong. </ I></i>

551
01:09:57,114 --> 01:09:58,824
<i> I met Gina when I
Studied medicine. </ I></i>

552
01:09:58,907 --> 01:10:01,410
<i> We were best friends. </ I></i>

553
01:10:01,410 --> 01:10:03,704
<i> My roommate Henry said,
That the kind of girl she was, </ i></i>

554
01:10:03,704 --> 01:10:05,664
<i> You waited to get married. </ I></i>

555
01:10:06,123 --> 01:10:09,084
<i> But, I waited too long. </ I></i>

556
01:10:10,127 --> 01:10:13,630
<i> She married Henry immediately after school.
And I was the witness. </ I></i>

557
01:10:13,714 --> 01:10:17,634
<i> And all these years later, I think
That I still am. </ I></i>

558
01:10:21,305 --> 01:10:22,973
Where were we stayed.

559
01:10:23,223 --> 01:10:26,643
Henry tried a clear position
It.

560
01:10:26,894 --> 01:10:29,771
About that you would go with him
The plastic? -- What else?

561
01:10:30,147 --> 01:10:32,983
Bob is rich.
That is not true.

562
01:10:33,317 --> 01:10:36,904
Derrick studied almost impossible.
And Derrick is strontrijk.

563
01:10:36,987 --> 01:10:38,947
It is not all about money.

564
01:10:39,072 --> 01:10:43,327
You stop it in time, you are doing the work.
Since you want to be compensated.

565
01:10:43,660 --> 01:10:46,079
It goes well with me.
-- It goes well with a lot of people.

566
01:10:46,163 --> 01:10:48,999
It goes well with her, that's where
She is the waitress.

567
01:10:49,333 --> 01:10:51,919
Anyone else I know, strontrijk.
-- I do not.

568
01:10:52,002 --> 01:10:56,298
You argue ingenious research. What a day
Leads to a great discovery.

569
01:10:56,924 --> 01:10:59,927
And that leads to patents, and then
We talk about very rich.

570
01:11:00,177 --> 01:11:02,513
There is nothing wrong, if they live
Of people trying to do better.

571
01:11:02,638 --> 01:11:06,850
No, it's great. Therefore I also love
Hers. I make people's lives better.

572
01:11:08,852 --> 01:11:13,023
That I do. Okay, I admit it.

573
01:11:13,106 --> 01:11:16,443
Work on tits and botox
That pays for my great car.

574
01:11:16,985 --> 01:11:21,114
Consider this view. A girl is born
With a nose on the ground that you can finish.

575
01:11:21,698 --> 01:11:24,618
There is no date for the eindfeest
For this girl. None shy first kiss.

576
01:11:24,743 --> 01:11:27,329
She comes into action, and of course
You lapt her fine.

577
01:11:27,412 --> 01:11:32,417
Eventually this girl wrote a farewell -
Letter to her cat, and jumps from one roof.

578
01:11:32,501 --> 01:11:35,212
The same girl comes to me ...

579
01:11:35,546 --> 01:11:38,549
I use a little magic, and my friend
That letter will never be written.

580
01:11:38,632 --> 01:11:41,510
I have saved her life.

581
01:11:43,387 --> 01:11:45,681
I have saved a life today.

582
01:11:46,098 --> 01:11:48,976
Maybe I have also known,
You know it but never.

583
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:53,981
But anyway, I sleep tonight
In a damn big house.

584
01:11:55,149 --> 01:11:57,317
I must urination.

585
01:11:57,901 --> 01:12:00,696
My husband.
-- Your husband.

586
01:12:06,660 --> 01:12:09,621
How is it with the snakes?
-- They are great.

587
01:12:09,913 --> 01:12:13,292
The times demolish me very much.
-- Feel you yourself?

588
01:12:14,001 --> 01:12:17,629
Exhausted. I fight against a cold.
-- I wish you came to me tomorrow.

589
01:12:17,754 --> 01:12:20,716
I would not bother you.
-- That is impossible.

590
01:12:20,716 --> 01:12:23,594
That lets you know right?

591
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:26,722
Make good for yourself.

592
01:12:29,516 --> 01:12:31,643
Think about what I said.

593
01:12:35,647 --> 01:12:39,193
Ga you in that direction?
-- I parked at the back.

594
01:12:40,110 --> 01:12:43,238
Is it well with you?
-- Yes, I am used to them.

595
01:12:44,698 --> 01:12:47,451
I love you.
-- I also love you.

596
01:12:56,627 --> 01:12:59,213
Bring me the dossier.

597
01:13:02,466 --> 01:13:05,719
You will cure haemophilia, small boy.

598
01:13:07,721 --> 01:13:10,724
This is not ratelslang.
Want tool?

599
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:13,852
Do not worry.

600
01:13:17,064 --> 01:13:19,817
What we have to do?
-- A slangenbeet.

601
01:13:22,820 --> 01:13:26,573
They gave us the wrong antidote
. They must now have a transfusion.

602
01:13:26,824 --> 01:13:28,951
Gina, can you hear me?

603
01:13:29,660 --> 01:13:32,955
Now awake. What?

604
01:13:35,666 --> 01:13:37,084
What did they?
-- I am not sure.

605
01:13:37,084 --> 01:13:38,836
Something about her blood. See what
Blood for it.

606
01:13:39,837 --> 01:13:42,422
Well, tell me about that snake.
-- You do not understand.

607
01:13:42,548 --> 01:13:44,800
It's been in her heart, she
Has a transfusion.

608
01:13:45,092 --> 01:13:48,345
Send me now that blood.
-- It has twenty-four hours.

609
01:13:53,016 --> 01:13:55,185
Here is the blood.

610
01:13:56,770 --> 01:14:00,023
What is this on?
-- The lab says it is extremely rare.

611
01:14:00,357 --> 01:14:03,026
Do we have this in stock?
-- I have never seen here.

612
01:14:03,277 --> 01:14:05,237
Check again.
Do it simply.

613
01:14:06,029 --> 01:14:10,075
Has Gina something of her own blood
In stock?

614
01:14:12,035 --> 01:14:15,289
Listen, it is bitten.

615
01:14:16,456 --> 01:14:19,459
Look again, it's very rare.
She is too weak, it is too late.

616
01:14:28,135 --> 01:14:31,263
We have not, I
The checked into the computer.

617
01:14:31,638 --> 01:14:34,850
We have her blood.

618
01:14:45,819 --> 01:14:48,739
What do you mean?
-- Wait, you understand not.

619
01:14:48,739 --> 01:14:50,365
You need to let me go.

620
01:14:50,491 --> 01:14:51,909
You understand it is not, it goes dead.

621
01:14:56,622 --> 01:14:59,291
It is good. Let me go.

622
01:15:00,417 --> 01:15:02,628
It is fine with me.

623
01:15:11,553 --> 01:15:13,722
<i> I am here directly from the studio
Palm Hills ...</ i></i>

624
01:15:13,722 --> 01:15:16,558
<i> Where Trista began with the recognition
Half of its music. </ I></i>

625
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:19,311
<i> We may not bring within,
In the actual recording ...</ i></i>

626
01:15:19,436 --> 01:15:22,815
<i> But while we wait, watch
We still agree to a recent interview ...</ i></i>

627
01:15:22,898 --> 01:15:27,319
<i> Which everyone wondered, pop superstar,
Or pop collapse? </ I></i>

628
01:15:27,653 --> 01:15:29,822
<i> What makes me special?
-- Yes. </ I></i>

629
01:15:30,155 --> 01:15:31,824
<i> Nothing.
-- Nothing? </ I></i>

630
01:15:31,949 --> 01:15:35,285
<i> You mean what makes me better,
Than everyone else? -- No. </ I></i>

631
01:15:35,369 --> 01:15:41,250
<i> Not better, just why you deserve that?
-- Why that I earn? </ I></i>

632
01:15:41,250 --> 01:15:44,920
<i> I have a special blood.
What do you think of them? </ I></i>

633
01:15:45,337 --> 01:15:48,882
<i> A blood?
-- Yes, it is called K.P.A.B. </ i></i>

634
01:15:49,299 --> 01:15:53,846
<i> Almost nobody has that.
That's my gift from God. </ I></i>

635
01:16:18,287 --> 01:16:22,374
I have spoken with the director, and said
No more than two pictures for that song.

636
01:16:25,169 --> 01:16:27,880
Is it good?
Do you need some air?

637
01:16:28,255 --> 01:16:30,048
I think you need some air.

638
01:16:30,424 --> 01:16:33,552
Can anyone please go backwards,
She has some air.

639
01:16:35,846 --> 01:16:38,390
I believe it. Reverse.

640
01:16:44,521 --> 01:16:47,441
Do this about.
-- What is going on?

641
01:16:47,483 --> 01:16:49,860
Your plane ticket and passport are
In the pocket.

642
01:16:49,943 --> 01:16:54,072
The gate is closed, you have to the front.
-- You need me admitted.

643
01:16:54,823 --> 01:16:56,200
Wait.

644
01:16:57,701 --> 01:16:58,827
Call nobody.

645
01:16:58,911 --> 01:17:03,290
Keep your gedeisd a while. Give me some time,
I make sure that someone you can achieve.

646
01:17:03,290 --> 01:17:05,751
I am a doctor.

647
01:17:05,876 --> 01:17:08,003
It goes damn death, and
It is your fault.

648
01:17:09,421 --> 01:17:12,132
It goes damn dead.

649
01:17:21,350 --> 01:17:25,020
Trista, wait.
-- No, step.

650
01:18:14,027 --> 01:18:18,031
I have shifted your performances,
And your video recordings will be cancelled.

651
01:18:21,285 --> 01:18:25,372
I am not angry with you, even though I know ...

652
01:18:25,998 --> 01:18:30,794
That you tried away.
But I am not angry with you.

653
01:18:31,962 --> 01:18:34,339
If you wanted to tell me?

654
01:18:35,549 --> 01:18:38,719
What should I tell you?
-- About the Baby.

655
01:18:39,052 --> 01:18:42,347
Am I pregnant?
-- Three weeks.

656
01:18:48,729 --> 01:18:51,023
Did you not?

657
01:18:58,655 --> 01:19:02,701
It seems to be good, I know
What you were trying to do.

658
01:19:03,035 --> 01:19:07,289
Do you think the whole world you love?
It is a damn dangerous life.

659
01:19:07,706 --> 01:19:11,460
You can not only do, I go for
You. I make sure it happens.

660
01:19:12,002 --> 01:19:13,712
All your dreams will come true.

661
01:19:13,712 --> 01:19:16,131
For that to be put aside, it would mean
That he died for nothing.

662
01:19:16,757 --> 01:19:18,717
That would mean that you him
Have killed for nothing.

663
01:19:18,717 --> 01:19:21,220
No, we have an appointment.

664
01:19:21,512 --> 01:19:25,933
He stood in the way, I have done my part.
Now it's time to do your part.

665
01:19:26,266 --> 01:19:30,479
We have a special someone
Lost. Now is the time to proceed.

666
01:19:30,854 --> 01:19:33,565
I hate you.

667
01:19:34,358 --> 01:19:38,695
Until the day that I will be dead,
I will hate you.

668
01:19:49,873 --> 01:19:53,252
You can not keep the baby.
-- What?

669
01:19:53,377 --> 01:19:56,713
You have concerts and TV appearances,
You can not keep the baby.

670
01:19:56,797 --> 01:20:03,554
It is my baby.
-- Nobody is our way. Nobody.

671
01:20:05,973 --> 01:20:10,519
You have about two weeks a concert.
Enough time to be here with handler.

672
01:20:10,853 --> 01:20:13,564
I will make arrangements.

673
01:22:25,320 --> 01:22:27,573
Wait.

674
01:23:13,494 --> 01:23:16,038
You need me EUR.

675
01:23:22,503 --> 01:23:24,796
I need you.

676
01:25:13,489 --> 01:25:17,951
You have saved a life today.
-- You are the.

677
01:25:20,954 --> 01:25:22,748
It's funny ...

678
01:25:22,831 --> 01:25:27,419
If only that one little part,
And all the rest ...

679
01:25:30,130 --> 01:25:33,759
I am glad that it goes well with your baby.

680
01:25:34,968 --> 01:25:37,513
Me too.

681
01:25:38,889 --> 01:25:41,141
Thanks that I could borrow.

682
01:25:42,142 --> 01:25:44,937
I bring you back as soon as
As I can. -- Does not matter.

683
01:25:50,734 --> 01:25:53,028
Is all well with you?

684
01:25:54,863 --> 01:25:58,283
Yes, it will be good.

685
01:26:00,494 --> 01:26:03,914
It's hard, a fresh start.

686
01:26:05,290 --> 01:26:07,709
You are good.

687
01:26:08,585 --> 01:26:11,880
You too.
Thank you.

688
01:26:32,860 --> 01:26:35,988
I am sorry Sir, you can
Not inside.

689
01:26:36,363 --> 01:26:39,032
Sir, you do not have permission.

690
01:27:21,325 --> 01:27:23,994
That was stupid.

691
01:27:24,536 --> 01:27:26,705
Is all well with you?
