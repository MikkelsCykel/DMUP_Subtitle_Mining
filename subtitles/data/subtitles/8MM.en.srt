{1973}{2003}Welcome to Miami.
{2009}{2091}While in the airport, please|observe Florida laws...
{2096}{2154}... which prohibit smoking|in the terminal.
{2160}{2215}Thank you for not smoking.
{4094}{4167}Your son-in-law dealt with the|dry cleaning franchise during the day.
{4172}{4224}He saw that woman every night.
{4270}{4371}The specifics are in my report,|and information about the woman.
{4414}{4458}lt's unpleasant, l know.
{4479}{4518}Discreet, isn't he?
{4529}{4572}What an imbecile!
{4580}{4656}l tried to warn my daughter,|but what can you do?
{4661}{4729}l worry about the children.
{4734}{4789}My invoice is in the envelope,|if that's all.
{4805}{4855}Yes, Mr. Welles. Thank you.
{4869}{4952}Senator, let me know if l can be|of further assistance to you.
{4958}{4997}l'll be in touch.
{5898}{5931}Hello?
{5944}{5979}You're home.
{5998}{6037}We're back here.
{6066}{6087}How did it go?
{6093}{6119}l think very well.
{6125}{6153}Good.
{6160}{6206}Daddy's home, sweetie.
{6235}{6285}How's the textbook business?
{6306}{6390}l got 1 0,000 words on|the Federal Theatre project.
{6396}{6476}lt should be 4000 and the writer|doesn't want to change anything.
{6482}{6515}So, kind of bad.
{6549}{6586}How was Miami?
{6592}{6626}Fine. Lonesome.
{6632}{6680}Couldn't pay me enough|to live down there.
{6687}{6725}Then why'd you go?
{6736}{6812}Senator Michaelson|has powerful friends.
{6949}{6999}Hello, Cinderella.
{7016}{7066}Did you miss me?|l sure missed you.
{7072}{7109}Oh, that's my girl.
{7115}{7171}She missed you.|l missed you.
{7207}{7238}You been smoking?
{7275}{7315}Smoking? l'm not smoking.
{7345}{7388}Come on, honey.
{7403}{7440}You reek of it.
{7458}{7526}Amy, l've been sitting around|in bars following this guy.
{7532}{7577}ls this the first thing l get?
{7582}{7647}-You're accusing me?|-l'm not accusing you.
{7671}{7742}l'm not smoking, okay?|We've been all through that.
{7768}{7820}l'll make dinner.|Are you hungry?
{7826}{7848}You're cooking?
{7956}{8008}l missed you.
{8136}{8192}l don't like it when you leave.
{8307}{8342}Should l go?
{8356}{8392}l'm going to do it.
{8671}{8702}Come on.
{8708}{8776}What's all the trouble, Cinderella?
{8793}{8832}There, there.
{9045}{9092}l love you.
{9163}{9196}l love you.
{9521}{9573}Honey, phone!
{9783}{9821}Okay, l've got it!
{9827}{9891}Sorry, l was just switching phones.
{9984}{10043}lt's a pleasure to make|your acquaintance, Mr. Longdale.
{10049}{10101}How can l be of assistance to you?
{10231}{10277}Four o'clock would be fine.
{10377}{10423}l think l know where it is.
{11406}{11468}Daniel Longdale.|We spoke on the phone.
{11474}{11494}Pleasure.
{11499}{11574}l'm the Christians' attorney and|an executor of the estate.
{11580}{11606}This is Mrs. Christian.
{11612}{11653}An honour to meet you.
{11660}{11716}You come highly|recommended, Mr. Welles.
{11722}{11819}l've spoken to associates of mine in|Harrisburg, Lancaster and Hershey.
{11824}{11862}You have influential friends.
{11867}{11938}l've been privileged to provide|services for people l admire.
{11943}{12002}You were praised|for your discretion...
{12008}{12088}...your strict adherence|to confidentiality.
{12094}{12114}Thank you.
{12192}{12266}As you know,|my husband passed away recently.
{12272}{12325}My condolences, Mrs. Christian.
{12330}{12453}His passing has left me|with something of a dilemma.
{12463}{12514}l'll do whatever l can to help.
{12537}{12592}My husband's inner sanctum.
{12598}{12663}Not many people have been|inside this room.
{12723}{12766}My father worked the Pittsburgh mill.
{12772}{12825}lrving United Steel, l believe.
{12831}{12889}But you attended Penn|on an academic scholarship.
{12894}{12921}That's right.
{12926}{12987}Peers went into law and finance.|You chose surveillance.
{12992}{13036}l decided it was the future.
{13047}{13083}Your husband is a legend.
{13090}{13113}Please.
{13119}{13180}We were married 45 years.
{13186}{13264}Four children, seven grandchildren.
{13275}{13316}But his true passion lay...
{13321}{13352}...in his work.
{13358}{13402}But he was always loyal.
{13407}{13480}l loved him deeply.
{13490}{13525}l understand.
{13582}{13615}Daniel.
{13632}{13720}My husband was the only one|with the combination to this safe.
{13725}{13765}We hired somebody to open it.
{13775}{13824}l prevented anyone...
{13829}{13882}...from seeing the contents.
{13887}{13961}l felt these were|my husband's private things.
{13968}{13994}l didn't....
{14037}{14086}l didn't realize....
{14106}{14162}Do you want to tell me|what you found?
{14225}{14273}Cash, stock certificates.
{14278}{14381}Nothing out of the ordinary,|really, except that.
{14427}{14454}lt's a film...
{14507}{14558}...where a girl appears to be murdered.
{14563}{14605}l'm not sure l understand.
{14611}{14649}lt's very realistic.
{14654}{14731}But how many people seem to be|realistically killed...
{14736}{14782}...in movies and on TV every day?
{14803}{14890}lt begins as a relatively|sleazy bit of pornography...
{14896}{14968}...and rapidly turns|quite violent and bloody.
{15095}{15161}What you're talking about|is called a snuff film.
{15166}{15222}Snuff films are a kind of urban myth.
{15240}{15308}Sex industry folklore.|There's no such thing.
{15314}{15357}That's what l explained|to Mrs. Christian.
{15362}{15422}This is probably|an S & M film of some sort.
{15428}{15475}Simulated rape, simulated violence.
{15481}{15535}lt's hard to stomach,|but there are ways of doing it.
{15541}{15579}Fake blood, special effects.
{15584}{15661}Would you look at the film|and give us your opinion?
{15676}{15704}All l want...
{15709}{15812}...is to know that|this atrocity is false.
{15827}{15868}l want the proof.
{18631}{18652}Well...
{18658}{18733}...whoever made the film|was adept at authenticity.
{18739}{18827}But l'm no expert.|Let the police make a determination.
{18832}{18852}Out of the question.
{18858}{18924}That'd be so unnecessary|for any number of reasons...
{18930}{19006}...not the least of which is|Mr. Christian's reputation.
{19044}{19090}Find out who made this film...
{19096}{19139}...and establish whether it's real.
{19149}{19182}You can name your price.
{19188}{19279}You'll be provided with|whatever you need to buy information.
{19336}{19382}Girl's all l've got to go on.
{19388}{19431}l could treat it|like a missing persons case.
{19436}{19458}Understood.
{19464}{19487}Of course...
{19493}{19582}...we need to be assured|that you would not copy this film.
{19588}{19631}You have my word on that.
{19642}{19690}But l'll be dealing|directly with you...
{19695}{19718}...and only you.
{19724}{19768}Your relationship with|your attorney is your own.
{19773}{19820}-No offense.|-None taken.
{19826}{19904}l realize you've given this|careful consideration.
{19947}{19975}You could have destroyed it.
{19980}{20043}Tell me the poor girl wasn't killed.
{20048}{20080}Please?
{20086}{20130}Find her alive.
{20136}{20188}l'll do the best l can, ma'am.
{21180}{21200}Cleveland?
{21205}{21230}You just got home.
{21236}{21301}l wish l could stay,|but this is the mortgage.
{21307}{21342}lt's Cindy's college money.
{21348}{21402}lf l do right by her,|with the circle she runs in...
{21408}{21442}...this could be a big break.
{21448}{21481}Do we need a break?
{21486}{21534}Your father thinks we do.
{21599}{21674}So, what was Mrs. Christian like?
{21680}{21764}Like you'd expect, l guess.|l feel sorry for her.
{21770}{21795}lt's a missing persons.
{21800}{21864}l told her l'd give it|a couple of weeks. Three.
{21881}{21954}lt can't take longer than that.|lt's an outside shot.
{21960}{22058}That's all l can tell you.|Sometimes you can't know what l'm doing.
{22075}{22119}lt's always that way.
{22151}{22231}-She's awake. l'll get her.|-l'll be up in a sec.
{22924}{22973}-You're taking the gun?|-l won't need it.
{22978}{22998}Don't take it.
{23004}{23071}l won't wear it.|lt's a precaution. Don't worry.
{23077}{23140}Will you call me|when you get there, please?
{23517}{23616}l've been hired by a couple in|Philadelphia, a doctor and his wife.
{23622}{23700}A few days ago, they picked up|a girl hitchhiking off 81...
{23706}{23756}...a runaway, about 18, maybe.
{23762}{23852}They buy her a meal.|The doctor tries to convince her...
{23858}{23911}... that, at least,|she should call home.
{23917}{23978}Not surprisingly, the girl ate,|excused herself...
{23983}{24022}...that was the last they saw of her.
{24028}{24104}We had a friend of mine|at the department work up a sketch.
{24112}{24163}They want to see|if l can l.D. this girl...
{24169}{24220}...then pass along|a message to the parents...
{24226}{24275}...letting them know|the kid's alive.
{24301}{24347}You don't mind if l run a check?
{24352}{24384}Go ahead.
{24407}{24467}You want it, you got it.|Knock yourself out.
{24473}{24554}Anywhere from 850,000 to 1 ,000,000|missing every year.
{24560}{24643}We got as much as we can on computer,|then it's the wet-thumb method.
{24648}{24704}Files are by state|and year of disappearance.
{24710}{24771}Children are separate.|No eating or smoking.
{24777}{24819}-There's coffee.|-Any good?
{24824}{24851}Horrible.
{24857}{24904}lt'll be your best friend|after a few days...
{24910}{24947}... if you last that long.
{24953}{24982}Good luck.
{25075}{25107}Honey, it's me.
{25113}{25133}How are you?
{25139}{25164}l'm good.
{25170}{25193}Where are you?
{25199}{25267}l'm still in Cleveland.|How's Cindy?
{25273}{25346}She's sweet.|She's sleeping.
{25355}{25435}-l'm missing you bigtime.|-Yeah, l miss you too.
{25456}{25504}l'll call you tomorrow night.
{25521}{25550}Good night.
{25555}{25597}Good night, sweetheart.
{26656}{26707}Hello, Mrs. Christian?|Tom Welles.
{26713}{26742}Here's where we stand.
{26748}{26830}l checked the film stock.|lt's called Supralux 5-4-4.
{26836}{26922}The company that made that|stock discontinued it in '92.
{26927}{26984}So the film was made prior to that?
{26989}{27057}Yes. l'm probably being|overly thorough with this...
{27063}{27139}...but you might dig up your husband's|financial records...
{27145}{27184}...about 6 or 7 years ago.
{27190}{27254}See if there's anything|out of the ordinary.
{27259}{27346}This isn't a movie you drop off|at the one-hour photo.
{27351}{27394}So you think it's one of a kind.
{27400}{27482}The film is what we've got.|There's no negative.
{27497}{27563}Unlike video, it's not|designed to be duplicated.
{27569}{27619}Whatever this is,|l have a feeling...
{27625}{27695}... there aren't many copies|floating around, if any.
{27700}{27788}l'm looking for a girl|we're not even sure is missing.
{27794}{27859}With this happening 6 or 7 years ago...
{27865}{27966}... finding the guys who made this film|is going to be very difficult.
{27972}{28045}l know you can do it.|You're doing a wonderful job.
{28051}{28126}Please tell me you'll|continue the investigation.
{28132}{28181}l will. l'll keep trying for you.
{28186}{28247}You can count on me.|Goodbye, Mrs. Christian.
{28281}{28384}We can't come to the phone now,|so please leave a message at the beep.
{28390}{28415}Honey, it's me.
{28420}{28492}l'm sorry l forgot|to call last night.
{28498}{28537}l won't forget tonight.
{28543}{28611}l've been gone a long time.|l hope l'll be home soon.
{28617}{28685}l love you, and l miss you.|We'll talk tonight.
{30658}{30705}You looking for Janet?
{30863}{30910}Hello, Mrs. Mathews?
{30915}{30978}l'm Thomas Hart.|l'm a licensed investigator.
{30985}{31068}l've been hired by the U.S. Resource|Centre, Missing Persons...
{31074}{31112}...as part of an internal audit.
{31118}{31241}l'd like you to answer questions|about your daughter, Mary Anne.
{31247}{31347}l spoke to your FBl contact|yesterday, Agent....
{31353}{31389}Neil. Neil Cole?
{31395}{31498}Yes, Agent Cole. He told me|he'd call and let you know to expect me.
{31516}{31557}He didn't call?
{31707}{31727}ls this you?
{31781}{31830}You look about five years old.
{31841}{31862}A little older.
{31868}{31897}Sweet.
{31970}{32093}lt's important that you don't|let this raise your expectations.
{32105}{32183}lt's not going to effect|any ongoing efforts.
{32201}{32249}All l'm saying is, please know...
{32255}{32321}...l'm not here to create|any false hope.
{32414}{32489}We fought all the time,|Mary Anne and me...
{32495}{32523}...and her stepdad.
{32529}{32569}She hated him...
{32575}{32625}...because he wasn't her real dad.
{32641}{32713}Trouble here, trouble at school.
{32719}{32746}Trouble.
{32758}{32845}Didn't like rules.|Takes after me, l guess.
{32851}{32905}l had to learn the hard way.
{32943}{32985}Can l speak to your husband?
{32991}{33013}Her stepfather?
{33019}{33044}Dave?
{33050}{33082}Gone.
{33093}{33150}Two years after Mary Anne left.
{33159}{33232}All the time, she resented him.
{33238}{33329}l lost her because of him,|and then l lost him.
{33343}{33395}l'm the only one still here.
{33429}{33473}Did Mary have a boyfriend?
{33479}{33542}She was sneaking out with someone.
{33551}{33598}She wouldn't tell me who.
{33605}{33685}Coming home with hickeys,|lying all the time.
{33726}{33808}l am sorry to bring this up,|but in these circumstances...
{33814}{33853}...with the stepfather...
{33859}{33934}...were there any indications|of any sort of abuse?
{33942}{34012}There was nothing like that.|The police and FBl asked.
{34018}{34096}There wasn't anything like that.|She'd have told me.
{34101}{34166}l apologize. l had to ask.
{34193}{34299}Those are for her birthday.|One for every year she missed.
{34305}{34369}They'll be waiting for her|when she comes back.
{34418}{34465}lt's because l slapped her.
{34507}{34534}l know.
{34577}{34680}We was fighting about Dave,|and she was just pushing my buttons.
{34686}{34719}And l slapped her.
{34766}{34795}Jesus!
{34829}{34860}Next day, she was gone.
{34891}{34958}When kids run, they|almost always leave a note.
{34964}{34991}lt's guilt, usually.
{34997}{35038}There wasn't one.
{35045}{35072}Police looked.
{35078}{35141}An abduction's one thing,|a runaway's another.
{35147}{35226}Sometimes it's not the priority|for the police it should be.
{35233}{35333}There wasn't anything.|Don't you think l wish there was?
{35341}{35400}You're probably right,|but would you let me look?
{35445}{35483}You tell me...
{35489}{35542}...not to get my hopes up...
{35554}{35626}...not to raise my expectations.
{35723}{35755}Go ahead.
{35768}{35802}l need a drink.
{35834}{35866}Thank you.
{38464}{38508}Dear Mom,|if you're reading this...
{38514}{38587}... it means l called you|from Hollywood, California.
{38593}{38690}l left my diary behind because|l want you to see why l'm leaving.
{38695}{38737}lt's not because you hit me.
{38743}{38817}l hid this so Dave the dickhead|wouldn't find it.
{38824}{38873}Warren Anderson and me|are in love.
{38879}{38933}l'm going to start|a new life with him.
{38938}{38983}His dad owns|that garage in town.
{38996}{39059}But Warren has even bigger plans.
{39065}{39112}He'll become a star|in action movies.
{39118}{39184}He says l'm prettier|than a lot of girls in movies.
{39190}{39221}l could be a star too.
{39231}{39265}You want a drink?
{39275}{39314}When we cruise into Hollywood...
{39320}{39430}...l'll have fiery eyes that everyone|will notice, because l am in love.
{39485}{39551}You were right.|l didn't find anything.
{39576}{39604}Fixed you a drink.
{39610}{39667}Thanks, no.|l've got work to do.
{39673}{39719}l'll stop by tomorrow night.
{39742}{39803}We'll probably be married|by the time you read this.
{39836}{39893}Don't come looking for me,|because l'm not coming back.
{39899}{39988}Maybe someday you'll see me|on TV or in magazines.
{39994}{40070}Don't worry about me.|Love, Mary Anne.
{40079}{40120}Mr. Anderson?
{40174}{40194}Who's asking?
{40199}{40267}Tom Hart.|Excuse me not shaking hands.
{40289}{40367}l'm looking for your son.|You've got a son named Warren, right?
{40373}{40402}Sure.
{40426}{40489}What's it about? You a cop?
{40494}{40521}No, sir.
{40526}{40608}Just a friend from a while back.|Owe him some money.
{40627}{40669}You owe him money?
{40675}{40706}That's a new one.
{40754}{40813}You can leave it|right here if you want.
{40830}{40897}lf it's all the same,|l'd like to send it to him.
{40908}{40943}California, right?
{40985}{41024}California?
{41055}{41133}Son, you know where|the Fayetteville lockup is?
{41145}{41193}That's where Warren is.
{41199}{41258}Doing eight months on a B and E.
{41338}{41366}Thank you.
{41439}{41497}Yeah, man, l knew her.
{41527}{41591}Dumped that bitch right|before l moved to L.A.
{41601}{41670}She shows up knocking at my door|like a fucking stalker.
{41685}{41738}Told that bitch she could go to hell.
{41787}{41815}Where'd she go?
{41864}{41901}Hell, maybe.
{41925}{41992}l don't know and|l don't give a fuck, either.
{42032}{42102}She said she might work|at a titty bar or something.
{42117}{42178}Ask me, her tits|weren't all that great.
{42218}{42253}Did you hear from her again?
{42309}{42382}Because l fucked her|doesn't mean l wanted her there.
{42398}{42477}She came to Hollywood to be|a big fucking movie star.
{42491}{42553}And so did l.|Check me out now.
{42664}{42732}Why don't you pass me|one of them smokes?
{42894}{42927}l don't smoke.
{43033}{43068}How you doing?
{43074}{43096}l'm okay.
{43101}{43148}You don't sound okay.
{43157}{43198}lt's not easy.
{43203}{43234}Why? What's going on?
{43243}{43306}lt's just tougher than|l thought it would be.
{43311}{43343}ls it getting to you?
{43349}{43387}l got a lead l can't drop.
{43393}{43440}l'm almost done.|l miss you.
{43450}{43484}l miss you too.|l love you.
{43490}{43527}Give Cindy a kiss for me.
{43533}{43609}Wait, l think she wants to say bye.|Say bye to Daddy.
{43614}{43678}Hi, sweetie. Hi, honey.
{43691}{43717}Hi, Cinderella.
{43723}{43777}She's touching the phone.
{43801}{43860}You should see her face|at your voice.
{43876}{43899}l love you.
{43904}{43965}l love you too. Bye.
{44025}{44073}l was just making dinner.
{44080}{44150}l've made enough for two,|as it happens.
{44156}{44202}l'm sorry, l can't stay.
{44208}{44295}l wanted to let you know|l spoke to my people at the agency.
{44301}{44373}l told them to keep|Mary Anne's case active.
{44401}{44435}Well...
{44453}{44531}...stay for a drink, at least.
{44625}{44665}You sure you're not hungry?
{44670}{44739}lt'd be nice to have a meal|without the TV on for once.
{44762}{44800}l have a long drive ahead of me.
{44806}{44875}lt's one of the most|depressing things. Eating alone.
{44880}{44964}l don't know why. You think|l'd be used to it by now.
{45229}{45254}Mrs. Mathews?
{45284}{45315}Janet.
{45349}{45380}Do you ever consider....
{45394}{45461}Do you realize that|Mary may never come back?
{45500}{45551}l think about it every day.
{45567}{45604}Every time the phone rings...
{45610}{45690}...every time, l still think it's her.
{45707}{45762}She's all l think about.
{45803}{45843}Can you tell me...
{45865}{45953}...if you had to make a choice,|if you were forced to choose...
{45967}{46048}...between imagining her|out there somewhere...
{46054}{46129}...living a good life, being happy...
{46163}{46204}...but you don't know...
{46221}{46264}...you never find out...
{46300}{46350}...or the worst being true...
{46369}{46408}...her being gone...
{46440}{46477}...but you know.
{46498}{46541}You finally know...
{46575}{46617}...what's happened to her.
{46654}{46696}What would l choose?
{46727}{46751}Yes.
{46849}{46895}l would choose to know.
{46959}{47007}l need to know.
{47168}{47242}Excuse me,|l have to use your restroom.
{48535}{48574}You're leaving.
{48698}{48755}l'll call you if l find anything out.
{52663}{52688}How you doing?
{52717}{52741}Big date tonight?
{52766}{52804}Yeah, guess so.
{52810}{52875}Could l interest you|in a battery-operated vagina?
{52895}{52941}lt's tempting, but no thanks.
{52950}{53032}l'd hate to see you in one|of those everyday situations...
{53038}{53113}...that calls for it|and you don't have one.
{53118}{53154}l'll risk it.
{53191}{53262}All right, your total|is $74.58, please.
{53346}{53381}A hundred.
{53505}{53596}Total's $25 and some change.
{53677}{53742}Thank you for shopping|at Adult Bookstore.
{53748}{53809}And have yourself a fabulous day.
{53817}{53853}What are you reading?
{53917}{53960}Catchy title.|What are you really reading?
{53965}{54043}Hard to believe it's got|any parts worth highlighting.
{54123}{54162}Capote.
{54209}{54237}You know how it is.
{54252}{54333}Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself|in front of your fellow perverts.
{54363}{54439}l might get drummed out|of the pornographers' union.
{54445}{54484}Where would l be then?
{54554}{54593}Have a good day.
{55258}{55287}How are you?
{55293}{55329}Hey, honey.
{55338}{55382}-How you doing?|-l'm a little beat.
{55387}{55407}How's Cindy?
{55413}{55458}She's sweet. She misses you.
{55463}{55502}How's it going?
{55517}{55595}The way things are going,|l'm thinking about coming home.
{55605}{55627}Really?
{55668}{55702}Honey, wait.
{55767}{55806}Can l call you back?
{55827}{55890}l'll call you right back, l promise.|Bye, honey.
{56913}{56951}Mrs. Christian, there were three men.
{56957}{57016}Not just the cameraman|and the masked man.
{57032}{57101}l caught a glimpse of a third man.|He was watching.
{57144}{57207}l'll get a clearer image|through computer enhancement.
{57213}{57290}But this probably happened|6 years ago, so it's not--
{57297}{57340}All right, l'll keep trying.
{57346}{57413}Thank you, l appreciate|your support. Goodbye.
{57440}{57516}What we have here is|1 37 billable man-hours...
{57522}{57583}...a hundred-plus thousand|dollars machine...
{57589}{57700}...and the result is an enhancement|of the back of some guy's head.
{57747}{57781}Want it framed?
{57821}{57873}There you go. Have a nice day.
{57919}{57994}lt's like a gas station,|you pay before you pump.
{58017}{58054}Remember me?
{58117}{58188}Came back for the battery-operated|vagina after all.
{58204}{58260}l need information.|Maybe you can help.
{58265}{58339}Thomas Welles. Nice picture.
{58351}{58429}What sort of information?|l got all different kinds.
{58434}{58461}The kind l'll pay for.
{58485}{58543}l don't know|what you're looking for...
{58549}{58600}...so we're clear from the start,|l'm straight.
{58606}{58633}Congratulations.
{58639}{58666}Thank you.
{58672}{58694}Zip it!
{58700}{58731}l can hook you up.
{58737}{58779}Name the vice,|l name the price.
{58795}{58872}-How long you been working here?|-Almost two years.
{58878}{58929}What's your name,|if you don't mind me asking?
{58935}{58972}Max.
{59004}{59027}Here's the deal.
{59033}{59099}This thing has to do|with underground pornography.
{59105}{59171}Stuff that's sold|under the counter, illegally.
{59177}{59229}There's not much illegal out there.
{59235}{59322}Whatever there is, l want to know.|l want a good look.
{59328}{59420}lf you've got that kind of|connection, great. lf not, speak now.
{59429}{59462}You're not a cop, are you?
{59468}{59521}lf l ask and you are,|you got to tell me.
{59527}{59564}l'm not a cop.
{59585}{59614}A private detective?
{59620}{59655}Like Shaft?
{59676}{59740}You ever seen Private Dicks?|l got it on sale.
{59746}{59785}How much you make in there?
{59849}{59928}Around 400 bucks a week,|off the books.
{59932}{59988}Let's pretend l live|in the same fantasy world...
{59994}{60044}...where you make $400|a week in that dump.
{60050}{60103}l'll give you 500 for a few days.
{60109}{60139}Six sounds good, Pops.
{60145}{60175}Five.
{60208}{60250}Here's my number.
{60349}{60390}When can you start?
{60400}{60465}Well, tomorrow night l get off late.
{60489}{60513}Tomorrow.
{60519}{60540}All right.
{60546}{60617}And don't call me Pops.
{60632}{60709}Of course not. l wouldn't|want to hurt your feelings.
{60768}{60813}l don't know what your scene is.
{60819}{60863}You may like porn|as much as the next guy.
{60869}{60959}You don't look like your average|sleaze. More like your average cop.
{60964}{61049}So when you ask people|about fucking illegal stuff...
{61055}{61102}...it has a certain patina to it.
{61107}{61128}Patina.
{61134}{61183}lt's a Truman Capote word. Hello?
{61189}{61278}lf someone never sold a snuff film,|they shouldn't care what l ask.
{61284}{61331}lf they have,|they should be nervous.
{61337}{61400}Whoever acts insulted,|knock on their door.
{61406}{61500}Look, Pops, it's not too late|to change your mind about all this.
{61506}{61573}There's things you'll see|that you can't unsee.
{61579}{61659}-They stay in your head.|-How do you know what l've seen?
{61664}{61742}Okay, fine.|But everybody's got their limit.
{61748}{61832}l've been here six fucking years|trying to get my music together.
{61838}{61923}So l start part-time|where l work, to make ends meet.
{61929}{62011}And boom, a couple years go by,|and here l am.
{62017}{62105}l'm just saying, before you know it,|you're in it. Deep in it.
{62111}{62150}Don't worry about me.
{62156}{62178}But thank you.
{62184}{62225}You're welcome.
{62237}{62312}Pops, you dance with the devil,|the devil don't change.
{62320}{62363}Devil changes you.
{62372}{62402}Some of your lyrics?
{62407}{62427}That's cute.
{62700}{62750}This place has been around|about 3 years...
{62756}{62813}...but they keep moving it|house to house.
{63207}{63253}This is the tip of the iceberg.
{63259}{63327}Lots of Mexican S & M,|lots of Asian bondage...
{63333}{63409}...all kinds of bestiality,|if you're into that.
{63414}{63469}Don't touch nothing.|You want something, tell Friendly.
{63474}{63498}Ask him.
{63799}{63828}Don't do that!
{63836}{63869}All right! lt's cool!
{63914}{63941}All right? Okay.
{64140}{64189}Come on, let's go. All right!
{64287}{64358}Are you affiliated with law enforcement?
{64364}{64395}Fuck you, Larry.
{64401}{64497}Are you a law enforcement agent,|or affiliated with law enforcement?
{64503}{64532}Fuck you, Larry.
{64538}{64583}You're getting cool there, Welles.
{64589}{64679}You got your porn zombies here.|Junkies for the hard stuff.
{64685}{64738}But these sales|won't last much longer.
{64744}{64795}lt's risky,|and everything's on the Net.
{64801}{64855}Chicken hawks swapping photos|with their modems.
{64861}{64947}Then there's classified ads|with hidden codes, secret couriers...
{64953}{65001}...wires through dummy corporations.
{65007}{65083}lf something's illegal, the buyers|are as far away as they can get.
{65089}{65161}Nobody knows what nobody knows,|you know what l mean?
{65166}{65201}How's it going, Samuel?
{65317}{65355}l'll say hi to her.
{65369}{65412}How are you? l love that.
{65418}{65480}lt's the Michael Jackson look,|with the zippers.
{66252}{66289}What are these?
{66312}{66355}Extreme bondage.
{66364}{66401}Rape films.
{66423}{66463}Sick shit.
{66473}{66537}Buy five, get one for free.
{66580}{66616}Anything harder?
{66622}{66676}There's nothing harder.
{66695}{66720}Snuff?
{66793}{66852}There's no such thing as snuff.
{66863}{66915}What you see is what l got, mister.
{66920}{66970}Do you know where l can get some?
{66975}{67017}Fuck off.
{68172}{68201}There she is.
{68207}{68280}There she is.|lt's Double Slap Dorothy.
{68286}{68342}That chick could be|a baseball player.
{68347}{68388}The swing on her is unreal.
{68417}{68503}Some of these S & M and bondage films|you'll see straddle the line.
{68509}{68548}Foot fetish, orgies, shit films...
{68554}{68617}...hermaphrodites, mutilation.|lt's harder than hard-core.
{68623}{68651}But mostly legal.
{68657}{68677}Stick.
{68683}{68715}One guy sees it and pukes.
{68721}{68792}Another guy sees it|and he falls in love.
{68815}{68893}This is the guy l told you about.|Got the tapes?
{68923}{68943}$1 000.
{68949}{69002}-1 200 for the two.|-You told Max 1 000.
{69008}{69112}l know. This is more fun. l raise|the price, you get pissed off.
{69118}{69175}-l thought we had a relationship.|-ls it real?
{69180}{69245}Sickest shit you'll ever see.
{69367}{69391}ls that real?
{69424}{69476}That sure as shit looks real.
{69656}{69699}She's not breathing.
{69920}{69960}Who makes these films?
{69966}{70000}l don't know.
{70008}{70056}Looks like the Philippines.
{70175}{70237}Yeah, definitely the Philippines.
{70789}{70851}Wait a minute.|That's the same girl.
{70857}{70892}lsn't that the same girl?
{70900}{70927}Look.
{70964}{70995}lt is the same.
{71000}{71028}They're fakes.
{71089}{71129}That's great.
{71168}{71245}Snuff 2.: The Resurrection.
{71251}{71287}Oh, boy.
{71293}{71353}Well, what do you expect for 1 200?
{71420}{71478}You want a beer or something?|l could use anything.
{71520}{71597}But l'm sorry, man.|l told you snuff was bogus.
{71603}{71669}l just wish l would have|gotten you a receipt.
{71682}{71712}'' Hard Spank.''
{71728}{71775}'' Max California.''
{71781}{71827}That's my old band.
{71834}{71864}We broke up.
{71869}{71896}When?
{71904}{71948}Maybe about a year ago.
{71980}{72036}l don't mean any offense...
{72042}{72103}...but what are you doing|mixed up in all this?
{72122}{72191}l'm not mixed up in anything, Pops.
{72196}{72259}You strike me as being smart enough|to do something else.
{72280}{72311}Thanks.
{72317}{72375}l wish you owned a record label.
{72394}{72456}Look, it beats pumping gas.
{72471}{72531}l don't buy it.|l don't endorse it.
{72548}{72578}l just point the way.
{72610}{72649}You said it gets to you.
{72654}{72689}Well, hell, yeah.
{72695}{72755}Parade of losers l see every day?
{72761}{72802}What choices have l got?
{72807}{72908}The music industry is not exactly|beating down my door.
{72933}{73001}And what about you, Tom Welles?
{73011}{73092}You got a ring on your finger.|You got kids?
{73101}{73132}A daughter.
{73174}{73227}So you got a wife and a daughter...
{73233}{73277}...and a nice little yellow house...
{73282}{73332}...and a dog named Shep.
{73340}{73396}What the hell are you doing here?
{73464}{73500}Good question.
{73568}{73613}Do you get turned on|at places like tonight?
{73662}{73690}No, l am not.
{73695}{73751}You don't exactly|get turned off, either.
{73812}{73858}Devil's changing you already.
{73870}{73909}Good night, Max.
{74844}{74931}This gentleman was asking if anyone|recognizes this girl.
{74979}{75007}Yes.
{75013}{75046}l remember Mary.
{75052}{75096}Mary Anne Mathews?
{75130}{75221}She lived here for only about a month,|if l recall correctly.
{75227}{75320}She didn't return one night.|Do you know what happened to her?
{75326}{75397}Not yet, but l'm looking|into it for her parents.
{75403}{75468}Could you get|that flowered one down for me?
{75483}{75515}That's her suitcase.
{75521}{75598}l'd forgotten about it|till you showed me her picture.
{75619}{75712}l suppose l always|hoped she'd be back.
{75718}{75762}She seemed so lost.
{75768}{75858}After a time, all l could do was pray|she'd moved on to better things.
{75864}{75912}Can you get this suitcase|to her people?
{75917}{75947}lf it's appropriate.
{75952}{75987}Yes, of course. Thank you.

{81731}{81808}You know how bad it has to be|for a jackass to come back...
{81814}{81885}... with a receipt|and try to fucking return it?
{81891}{81915}How bad?
{81921}{82015}Get together some upscale product|where the girls still have teeth.
{82036}{82096}Till then, fuck you!
{82106}{82143}Does your mother have any teeth?
{82149}{82203}lf she does,|send her down, you fuck.
{83755}{83800}He's not answering.
{84455}{84483}Hey, boss.
{84489}{84537}There's a case of beer in there.
{84642}{84700}-How was your day?|-Great.
{84744}{84813}-Everybody here?|-Everybody but one of the chicks.
{84824}{84855}Been watching them?
{86686}{86727}Celebrity Films.
{86761}{86798}l know all about it.
{86804}{86836}Yeah, you know about what?
{86842}{86878}About that girl...
{86888}{86928}...six years ago.
{86943}{86988}l know what you did to her.
{87017}{87043}Who is this?
{87049}{87084}You murdered her.
{87096}{87143}You and your friends.
{87166}{87220}What the fuck are|you talking about?
{87225}{87256}You killed her on film.
{87267}{87298}Now you're fucked.
{87304}{87347}You're all fucked.
{87694}{87725}Come on.
{87878}{87922}Come on, give me something, Eddie.
{88231}{88259}lt's me.
{88282}{88315}What do you want?
{88321}{88352}l just got a call.
{88357}{88422}We got to talk.|And not on the phone.
{88427}{88499}So one of us|has to get on a plane, all right?
{88505}{88575}Blow me, you paranoid fuck.
{88658}{88702}Fuck! Fuck!
{88954}{89011}So you like to watch, paranoid fuck.
{89213}{89277}Phone is listed under ''D. Velvet''|in Manhattan.
{89283}{89305}Dino Velvet.
{89311}{89387}He's a producerldirectorlweirdo.
{89393}{89431}He's like the Jim Jarmusch of S & M.
{89437}{89467}How hard is his stuff?
{89473}{89501}How hard do you want it?
{89507}{89595}Bondage, fetish, Gothic hard-core.|Definitely not for the squeamish.
{89601}{89638}Kind of hard to come by.
{89644}{89704}Mostly out of the back|of bondage magazines.
{89711}{89741}But he's got fans.
{89747}{89802}This guy l know, he thinks it's art.
{89808}{89889}He's told me Velvet will do|commissions if there's enough dough.
{89895}{89942}Nothing illegal, but borderline.
{89948}{90018}lf a guy wants to see|a transvestite in a rubber suit--
{90022}{90052}l got the picture.
{90057}{90108}Max, get in here!
{90132}{90165}So...
{90172}{90207}...you're going to New York?
{90213}{90242}Maybe.
{90258}{90300}Looking like that.
{90314}{90347}You'll need me.
{90353}{90434}This Frenchie guy is more|than just a fan of Velvet films.
{90439}{90478}l can get you in if you want.
{90497}{90528}For more money, of course.
{90534}{90602}Plus expenses. l fly first class.
{90608}{90647}So when are we leaving?
{90766}{90799}What are you doing?
{90822}{90904}Man, my first time in|the Big Bad Apple.
{90969}{91016}l told you, don't film me.
{91022}{91084}Fine, Howard Hughes.
{91329}{91382}You didn't say it'd be this luxurious.
{91388}{91465}-lt's the Presidential suite.|-A comforting sense of humour.
{91470}{91514}l'll be a couple of doors down.
{91519}{91591}Tom, l don't know why|we're staying in this fleabag.
{91597}{91651}People mind their own|business in fleabags.
{91657}{91732}l'm going out. Dig up|whatever Velvet tapes you can find.
{91737}{91757}Get receipts.
{91794}{91822}Yes, sir.
{91851}{91922}My husband had|five cash accounts he used.
{91927}{91965}Between November...
{91971}{92013}...of 1 992...
{92028}{92060}...and March...
{92066}{92120}...of 1 993...
{92126}{92215}...he wrote one check out|to cash from each account.
{92247}{92323}My husband never dealt|with money personally.
{92328}{92365}Certainly not cash.
{92371}{92438}These checks he wrote|are for very odd amounts.
{92443}{92518}When totalled together,|the five checks...
{92524}{92642}...from the five different accounts,|they equal $1 million.
{92659}{92710}That is interesting, Mrs. Christian.
{92715}{92766}l only mentioned this because...
{92772}{92842}...you asked me to look|for anything unusual.
{92849}{92909}l've got about $5000 left in cash.
{92914}{93002}l'll need another 50, if you approve|the plan l mentioned earlier.
{93008}{93094}l'm very close to identifying|the man in the mask.
{93099}{93152}l'll have Mr. Longdale arrange it.
{93157}{93203}How will l get it to you?
{93208}{93256}l'll give you the address.
{93263}{93346}Welcome to the world of Dino Velvet.
{94119}{94202}Welcome to the world of Dino Velvet.
{94868}{94937}Who is this?|ln the mask, who is he?
{94961}{95003}Come on, wake up.|Who is this?
{95009}{95097}One of Dino's lunatics.|He's in a bunch of these.
{95102}{95124}What's his name?
{95130}{95196}l don't know.|That's his whole thing.
{95202}{95250}He always wears a mask.
{95257}{95325}He calls himself Machete--|No, Machine.
{95331}{95398}He calls himself Machine.
{95437}{95488}He's a lover, man.
{95494}{95571}Definitely loves|what he does for a living.
{95593}{95642}Can't say the same about you.
{95899}{95937}Yes, yes.
{95974}{96040}You can see they really|appreciate my style here.
{96046}{96146}l'm not the kind to blend in|with the crowd, if you didn't notice.
{96152}{96212}Like these ladies here,|they like my style.
{96343}{96365}Who is it?
{96370}{96413}This is Max California.
{96419}{96488}l called earlier.|l'm a friend of Frenchie's, from L.A.
{96493}{96563}My partner and l would like|to speak to Mr. Velvet.
{96569}{96600}He's not here.
{96616}{96667}We have to give him|a large sum of money.
{96673}{96727}lf he's not interested, we'll split.
{97156}{97201}What are you talking about?
{97206}{97292}Can't you just answer|my simple question?
{97328}{97417}l asked you a question!|Where the fuck is Laura?!
{97426}{97496}l've been asking you that|the last 1 0 minutes.
{97501}{97559}Sit down.|Make yourself comfortable.
{97570}{97596}You idiot!
{97602}{97650}Going to shoot in two days?
{97656}{97709}Man, you're spending my money.
{97715}{97763}Yeah, you better do that.
{97776}{97818}Fucking asshole!
{97824}{97889}lt's an honour to meet you.|Thank you for seeing us.
{97926}{97954}God!
{98018}{98060}So, what can l do you for?
{98066}{98183}We'd like to commission a film.|A Dino Velvet original, one of a kind.
{98196}{98228}That's right.
{98240}{98293}l'm a huge admirer of yours.
{98298}{98352}God, l love flattery.
{98365}{98438}You're a genius, Mr. Velvet.|A goddamn genius.
{98443}{98498}The only one still transferring|film to video.
{98504}{98580}Nobody really appreciates|that kind of integrity anymore.
{98587}{98664}The grain and the gritty look you get.
{98726}{98757}Which is your favourite?
{98762}{98845}lf l had to choose, it'd either be|Choke or Devil.
{98864}{98962}The subliminal imagery in Choke|is what gets under your skin.
{98988}{99088}Well, Devil frightened me|as much as it excited me...
{99094}{99158}...but l'd be hard-pressed|to choose a favourite.
{99268}{99337}What kind of a budget|are we talking about?
{99363}{99464}Five thousand now.|Five thousand upon delivery.
{99469}{99522}Two women. One white, one black.
{99533}{99583}Hard bondage, of course.
{99593}{99634}Other than that, trusting...
{99642}{99687}...your artistic interpretation...
{99693}{99752}...l only have two stipulations.
{99869}{99904}Challenge me.
{99944}{99988}l want to watch you work.
{100008}{100075}You don't want a franchise, do you?
{100089}{100157}Steal the recipe for my secret...
{100163}{100215}...hot sauce?
{100237}{100267}No.
{100317}{100344}That's good.
{100349}{100398}l appreciate that.
{100525}{100560}Second stipulation.
{100566}{100607}The other performer...
{100624}{100667}...has to be...
{100672}{100715}...that animal you use.
{100721}{100761}The man in the mask.
{100797}{100829}Machine.
{101002}{101037}l don't know.
{101058}{101102}He might be interested.
{101130}{101207}But l think it'll cost you another...
{101268}{101317}...five to seven grand.
{101326}{101393}l can arrange something|really special for ten.
{101404}{101437}You can do that.
{101442}{101478}Good enough for me.
{101518}{101617}l'll just have to put|my thinking cap on.
{101708}{101787}l'm going to keep this as a deposit.
{101793}{101864}You make sure you call me|after 1 0 o'clock tonight.
{101871}{101911}1 0 o'clock.
{102006}{102111}You know, you have a very special,|very beautiful face.
{102117}{102171}The way light hits it.
{102188}{102232}l'd like to shoot you.
{102255}{102280}You don't mind?
{102311}{102344}l'm camera-shy.
{102354}{102422}You trust me to take your money,|but not your picture?
{102427}{102487}Those are two different|kinds of trust.
{102499}{102550}l hope we can do business.
{102762}{102843}Hoyt Avenue, Brooklyn, 3 o'clock.
{102906}{102939}l'll be there.
{103013}{103072}l got something to tend to. Thanks.
{103091}{103147}So are we in the movie business?
{103171}{103195}That's for you.
{103202}{103228}-What is it?|-Money.
{103233}{103272}People use it to purchase goods.
{103277}{103339}That's awfully generous and everything--
{103344}{103392}lt's not mine.|Don't make a big deal.
{103398}{103492}There's a plane ticket for the flight|you can catch to L.A. tonight.
{103498}{103545}This is as far as l want you to go.
{103550}{103592}What are you talking about?
{103597}{103634}We're a team.|We're partners.
{103641}{103756}Max, l'm sure you realize|these people we're dealing with...
{103779}{103816}...are extremely disturbed.
{103821}{103895}That's why you need me.|l know disturbed. Look at me.
{103900}{103971}You did a great job.|lt's time for you to go home.
{103976}{104022}But this is, like, our big case.
{104027}{104100}Tom, l know what's going on, okay?
{104113}{104141}Okay, what?
{104146}{104215}Dino and Machine and Eddie|made a snuff film, right?
{104221}{104307}l can't figure out why you're involved.|Maybe the victim--?
{104312}{104345}First, who said you're right?
{104351}{104412}Second, who said|anything about a victim?
{104417}{104468}Only 3 rules in life, Tom Welles.
{104474}{104551}One, there's always a victim.|And two, don't be it.
{104557}{104577}And three?
{104582}{104609}l forgot three.
{104614}{104667}Good, l want you to forget everything.
{104672}{104750}l want you to get on a plane to L.A.|and forget it all.
{104782}{104892}l get calls for work on the West Coast.|l'd like to call you again.
{104897}{104952}You're going to look me up|and call me?
{104958}{105052}l could use your help. l meant it|when l said l think you're smart.
{105058}{105109}l'm not patronizing you.
{105114}{105147}Well, thanks.
{105154}{105220}All right.|You take care, Max California.
{105372}{105443}All right, Tom Welles.|Devil's waiting on you.
{107427}{107470}There you are.
{107477}{107526}Come and join us.
{107806}{107846}Hello, Machine.
{107871}{107893}Love your work.
{108024}{108088}Did you bring the money?
{108121}{108153}lt's right here.
{108159}{108184}Good.
{108218}{108252}Where are the women?
{108257}{108293}Women...
{108319}{108367}...they're always late.
{108529}{108571}What are these for?
{108576}{108628}They're just props.
{108634}{108686}Nice, aren't they?
{108691}{108789}Machine and l were just talking|about the beauty of knives.
{108870}{108942}My guests have arrived!
{108994}{109115}Mr. W., would you be so kind as|to remove any firearms from your person?
{109134}{109158}What are you doing?
{109186}{109252}l hate to repeat myself.|lt makes me look so stupid.
{109268}{109296}Slowly.
{109302}{109356}Please, show me your gun.
{109382}{109418}Nice and easy!
{109452}{109504}That's right. Easy.
{109511}{109550}Good.
{109558}{109628}Now empty those bullets|onto the table.
{109633}{109668}Very carefully.
{109673}{109747}-l don't know why you think--|-Shut up, you fuck!
{109759}{109861}l'll put an arrow right through|your goddamn throat, you understand?
{110007}{110037}That's him.
{110063}{110098}Last bullet.|The last one.
{110117}{110143}Good boy.
{110149}{110213}Now cuff him to the bed, Eddie.
{110222}{110255}Yes, sir.
{110260}{110292}Machine!
{110456}{110526}l didn't know what|to make of you at first.
{110579}{110678}And you certainly had Eddie here|on pins and needles.
{110717}{110787}Lo and behold,|from right out of the blue came...
{110792}{110898}...an old business acquaintance of ours|to explain everything.
{110906}{110980}Satan ex machina.
{111007}{111071}You remember Mr. Longdale, don't you?
{111142}{111167}Get it over with.
{111172}{111223}Shut up. Nobody's talking to you.
{111274}{111348}What l could do with faces|like these on film.
{111368}{111456}But on second thought,|why would l need their faces?
{111479}{111515}You listen to me.
{111521}{111558}You'll get that film.
{111564}{111633}You'll bring it back here,|give it to me.
{111638}{111743}Just so we make this|as efficient as possible...
{111749}{111811}...there is an incentive.
{112074}{112126}He's got nothing to do with this.
{112131}{112174}He doesn't know anything.
{112179}{112272}Can't you guess|what l'm about to say next?!
{112309}{112368}lf you don't bring me that film...
{112373}{112429}...we're going to kill him,|fuck him...
{112439}{112476}...and film it.
{112554}{112613}lf that's not enough for you...
{112619}{112687}...we're going to go after|your family.
{112751}{112788}l'll get the film.
{112845}{112917}Good boy.|You're being very cooperative.
{112931}{112999}Mr. Longdale here will|keep you company.
{113026}{113049}Why me?
{113055}{113113}Because l don't like you,|Mr. Longdale.
{113348}{113384}Mr. W...
{113469}{113500}...hurry back.
{113608}{113712}Since l met you, there isn't much you've|done that l haven't been party to.
{113717}{113789}None of this would be happening|if you'd given up.
{113795}{113855}Or not taken the job|in the first place.
{113861}{113918}l never expected you to get this far.
{113924}{114022}l hired you because you're young|and completely out of your league.
{114027}{114083}But l underestimated your ambition.
{114089}{114208}You took one look at the Christian|compound. lt was heady, wasn't it?
{114213}{114310}You weren't peeking through the gates.|Mrs. Christian welcomed you in.
{114316}{114399}Do you think people like|the Christians hire people like us...
{114405}{114457}...as an invitation|to their dinner parties?
{114463}{114567}No, we're there to clean up the mess,|to wipe their royal asses.
{114572}{114612}You were asked to buy a snuff film.
{114617}{114694}They couldn't find one,|so you paid them to make one.
{114700}{114748}lsn't that what happened?
{114753}{114817}She was alive till you paid|to have her murdered?
{114822}{114867}How much did Christian|pay for your conscience?
{114873}{114893}A million?
{114912}{114951}l've been well compensated.
{114956}{114999}But you, l bought cheap.
{115038}{115122}Just because Mrs. Christian|praised your discretion...
{115128}{115207}...you sat on evidence of murder,|dragged your friend, family...
{115213}{115271}...into some old graveyard...
{115277}{115372}...to dig up a dead girl with no name|that nobody remembers.
{115378}{115409}Mary Anne Mathews.
{115414}{115486}That was her name.|Her mother remembers her.
{115492}{115524}l'm bored with this.
{115534}{115588}You know the difference between us?
{115593}{115669}l will survive this and profit by it,|whereas you...
{115675}{115702}...you will not.
{115708}{115746}Now get the film.
{115880}{115920}Did you watch it with him?
{115925}{115946}What?
{115951}{116003}The snuff film.|Did you watch it with him?
{116008}{116063}This isn't helping your friend.|Get the film.
{116069}{116096}Did it get him off?
{116107}{116141}Mr. Christian?
{116147}{116225}Watching them cut her up like that?|Did he jerk off to it?
{116230}{116284}Did you hold his cock?|Give him the hand job...
{116290}{116357}...while Mary Anne Mathews was dying?!
{116363}{116428}-What are you doing?|-Trying to understand!
{116433}{116487}What did he want|with a snuff film?!
{116497}{116519}Why?
{116524}{116572}Yes, why? Why?!
{116578}{116624}Why did he want a film...
{116630}{116689}...of a little girl being butchered?!
{116722}{116754}Because he could.
{116769}{116815}He did it because he could.
{116864}{116917}What reason were you looking for?
{117015}{117045}Now.
{117389}{117419}Here.
{117437}{117471}Shoot me.
{117686}{117744}Mr. Welles, the film, please.
{117771}{117800}Let him go first.
{117806}{117864}Do whatever you want to me,|but let him go.
{117869}{117930}Very well.|Set him free, Machine.
{118806}{118852}-ls that it?|-That's it.
{118858}{118887}Bravo.
{118922}{118965}You don't want to miss this...
{118973}{119013}...Mr. Welles.
{119234}{119280}So it ends.
{119329}{119392}As if she never existed.
{119404}{119488}Don't blame yourself.|You were in way over your head.
{119502}{119549}You motherfuckers!
{119601}{119662}You smalltime motherfuckers.
{119704}{119748}l want to know something.
{119758}{119854}Why you're still smalltime with a|million dollars to spread around?
{119868}{119888}Million?
{119893}{119963}Yeah! That's what Christian|gave Longdale!
{119983}{120025}That's what he gave you, right?
{120030}{120062}A million in cash?
{120072}{120124}You stupid fucking trash!
{120129}{120224}What the hell--?|ls he talking dollars here?
{120232}{120266}No, he's lying.
{120274}{120308}Did you fuck me?
{120341}{120368}Did you fuck me on this?
{120373}{120401}Of course not, Edward!
{120406}{120455}Then what's he talking about?
{120460}{120532}He's saying that Longdale fucked us...
{120538}{120610}...which is so totally,|completely bizarre.
{120625}{120646}Stay back.
{120663}{120687}Stay away from me.
{120708}{120739}Put the bow down!
{120744}{120792}l told you not to trust the prick.
{120797}{120861}Mr. Longdale, if there's no honour...
{120866}{120909}...among perverts and pornographers...
{120914}{120965}...the whole business would fall apart.
{120970}{121061}Because there's no records,|no contracts, no legal recourse.
{121067}{121103}So if someone...
{121109}{121140}...cheats us...
{121145}{121184}...that person can't be trusted.
{121195}{121263}That person could turn us in,|have us killed.
{121281}{121372}So we don't have a choice,|do we, Mr. Longdale?
{121377}{121452}l want this to be over.|Nobody else needs to get hurt.
{121457}{121492}Eddie, take your gun out.
{121504}{121527}Fuck you.
{121532}{121585}Take it out now! And drop it.
{121590}{121629}Or l will shoot.
{121639}{121683}Don't be stupid, Edward.
{121814}{121851}Kick it in my direction.
{121940}{122002}Now, Dino, drop the crossbow.
{122113}{122146}Action.
{122425}{122467}This is wrong.
{122482}{122528}Something's wrong.
{122533}{122568}God, not like this.
{122616}{122672}l am supposed to have...
{122690}{122733}...something more cinematic.
{122750}{122793}Kill them, Machine.
{122824}{122862}Kill them all.
{123044}{123072}Machine!
{124062}{124082}Stop, Eddie!

{128344}{128388}Yes, eight o'clock is fine.
{128393}{128423}Do you know...
{128429}{128526}...what the poor girl's name was?
{128581}{128628}Mary Anne Mathews.
{128718}{128742}Thank you.
{128750}{128800}Mr. Welles, goodbye.

{130718}{130783}Kept from a phone? What happened?
{130788}{130809}Start talking, Tom.

{130934}{130964}You're right.
{130970}{131017}Everything you say is right.
{131072}{131132}That won't do it.|That's not enough, Tom.

{163611}{163661}You know the best part|of killing someone?
{163675}{163724}The look on their face.
{163730}{163764}lt's that look...
{163769}{163809}...not when they're threatened...
{163814}{163854}...not when you hurt them...
{163859}{163923}...not even when they see the knife.
{163933}{163984}lt's when they feel the knife go in.
{163989}{164015}That's it.
{164028}{164069}lt's surprise.
