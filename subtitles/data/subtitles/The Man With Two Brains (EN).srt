00:01:37,063 --> 00:01:38,530
CHECK THE ARTLINE.

2
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:40,066
Est-ce que vous hyperventilez
le patient?

3
00:01:40,101 --> 00:01:41,568
Non, Docteur.

4
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:45,071
READY THE BONE WAX.
METZENBAUM SCISSORS.

5
00:01:45,106 --> 00:01:46,072
METZENBAUM SCISSORS.

6
00:01:47,073 --> 00:01:48,575
Dégagez moi ce chat.

7
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:50,041
Oui, monsieur.

8
00:01:50,076 --> 00:01:51,578
READY TO CLOSE. REMOVE
THE WEITLANDER RETRACTOR.

9
00:01:51,613 --> 00:01:53,347
Female Nurse:
WE'RE CLOSING, DOCTOR.

10
00:01:53,382 --> 00:01:54,982
REMOVE THE RAINEY CLIP,
FOR GOD'S SAKE.

11
00:01:55,017 --> 00:01:56,550
I APPRECIATE
YOUR LETTING ME

12
00:01:56,585 --> 00:01:58,084
OBSERVE THAT
BRAIN OPERATION TODAY.

13
00:01:58,585 --> 00:01:59,586
IT WOULD'VE
BEEN MORE COMPLICATED

14
00:02:00,086 --> 00:02:01,052
IF HE'D NEEDED ONE,

15
00:02:01,087 --> 00:02:03,339
BUT SINCE YOU WANTED TO
OBSERVE MY TECHNIQUE, I-

16
00:02:03,374 --> 00:02:05,592
THAT WAS VERY NICE OF YOU.
DOCTOR, WERE YOU, UH,

17
00:02:05,627 --> 00:02:08,094
WERE YOU INTERESTED
IN SCIENCE AS A CHILD?

18
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:10,096
I DON'T KNOW
IF I WAS INTERESTED

19
00:02:10,131 --> 00:02:11,097
SO MUCH IN THE SCIENCE

20
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:14,601
AS I WAS THE SLIME
THAT GOES ALONG WITH IT.

21
00:02:14,636 --> 00:02:15,602
SNAKES AND FROGS.

22
00:02:16,102 --> 00:02:19,105
WHEN I SAW HOW SLIMY
THE HUMAN BRAIN WAS, I...

23
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,107
I KNEW THAT'S WHAT
I WANTED TO DO

24
00:02:21,142 --> 00:02:22,626
WITH THE REST
OF MY LIFE.

25
00:02:22,661 --> 00:02:24,136
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
TIMON?

26
00:02:24,171 --> 00:02:25,612
I THOUGHT
YOU LIKED FISH.

27
00:02:25,647 --> 00:02:27,113
THEY TASTE FUNNY.

28
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:29,115
REALLY? IT'S FRESH.

29
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:31,117
IT CAME RIGHT OUT
OF THAT TANK.

30
00:02:33,672 --> 00:02:36,087
YOU HOOKED MY ANGEL FISH?!

31
00:02:36,122 --> 00:02:39,625
WHY DO YOU DO
THESE TERRIBLE THINGS?

32
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:43,129
BECAUSE I LOVE
TO SEE THOSE VEINS

33
00:02:43,164 --> 00:02:45,148
IN YOUR TEMPLE THROB.

34
00:02:45,183 --> 00:02:47,133
YOU-YOU-

35
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:50,101
I'LL KILL YOU.

36
00:02:50,136 --> 00:02:51,638
LOOK HERE,
YOU DEVIL WOMAN,

37
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:54,140
YOU'LL NEVER DO THIS
TO ANOTHER MAN!

38
00:02:54,175 --> 00:02:56,142
OH, YES, I WILL.
I'LL DO IT,

39
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:58,645
AND I'LL DO IT,
AND I'LL DO IT AGAIN.

40
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,164
WOULD YOU READ
THAT BACK TO ME?

41
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:01,424
I'M AFRAID THAT
MIGHT MAKE ME

42
00:03:01,459 --> 00:03:02,649
SOUND POMPOUS
TO YOUR READERS.

43
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:06,152
UH, "MY BRILLIANT RESEARCH
IN BRAIN TRANSPLANTATION

44
00:03:06,187 --> 00:03:07,619
"IS UNSURPASSED

45
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:10,657
AND WILL PROBABLY MAKE MY NAME
LIVE BEYOND ETERNITY."

46
00:03:10,692 --> 00:03:12,176
NO, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

47
00:03:12,211 --> 00:03:13,625
TAKE OUT THE "PROBABLY."

48
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,127
IT MAKES ME SOUND
WISHY-WASHY.

49
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:19,666
YOU TAKE YOUR HANDS OFF ME,
YOU IMPOTENT PRUNE!

50
00:03:19,701 --> 00:03:21,435
OHH!

51
00:03:26,172 --> 00:03:29,140
MY RENOIR!
I'LL KILL YOU!

52
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:31,678
I GET SO EXCITED
WHEN YOU GET ANGRY.

53
00:03:31,713 --> 00:03:33,197
IT MAKES ME FEEL
SO MUCH CLOSER

54
00:03:33,232 --> 00:03:34,681
TO THE READING
OF THE WILL.

55
00:03:34,716 --> 00:03:36,648
YOU WON'T GET A PENNY.

56
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:39,185
I CHANGED MY WILL
MONTHS AGO.

57
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,687
YOU SON OF A BITCH.

58
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:43,189
WELL, I GUESS I'LL
JUST HAVE TO FIND ME

59
00:03:43,224 --> 00:03:44,691
A NEW MAN TO TORTURE.

60
00:03:44,726 --> 00:03:45,657
DR. FURRIER-

61
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:47,193
THAT'S... HFUHRUHURR.

62
00:03:47,228 --> 00:03:48,159
I'M SORRY.

63
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:49,160
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

64
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:50,662
A LOT OF PEOPLE
MISPRONOUNCE IT,

65
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:52,198
BUT IT SOUNDS JUST
THE WAY IT'S SPELLED.

66
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:57,203
H- F-U-H-R-U-H-U-R-R.
HFUHRUHURR.

67
00:03:57,238 --> 00:03:58,705
HFUHRUHURR-RUR.

68
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:01,708
THAT'S GOOD. YOU JUST WENT
A LITTLE PAST IT THERE.

69
00:04:01,743 --> 00:04:04,210
JUST PUT THE BRAKES ON
A LITTLE SOONER.

70
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:07,213
DOCTOR, I, UH...
I KNOW YOU WERE QUITE SHAKEN

71
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:09,215
BY THE TRAGIC DEATH
OF YOUR WIFE.

72
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:11,718
OH, I COULDN'T TALK
ABOUT IT FOR A LONG WHILE,

73
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:15,221
BUT... TIME PASSES BY,
AND I CAN HANDLE IT NOW.

74
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:17,974
HER NAME WAS REBECCA.

75
00:04:18,009 --> 00:04:20,226
WHY?! WHY?! WHY?! WHY?!

76
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:23,730
IS OOKIMS HAVING
A MASSIVE HEART ATTACK?

77
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:28,234
WHAT A SHAME, WITH ME
SO YOUNG AND HOT!

78
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:29,200
POM-POM!

79
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:32,739
RIP HER THROAT OUT!

80
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,708
AAH!

81
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:42,248
WHY?! WHY?! WHY?!
WHY?! WHY?! WHY?!

82
00:04:42,283 --> 00:04:43,767
DR. FURRIER!

83
00:04:43,802 --> 00:04:45,778
HFUHRUHURR!

84
00:04:45,813 --> 00:04:47,784
I'M SORRY.

85
00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:49,756
SHE WAS...

86
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:51,257
EVERYTHING.

87
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:53,224
IS THAT HER?

88
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:56,262
NO. THAT'S JUST
A STATUE OF HER.

89
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:59,230
OUR GARDENER RAMON,
HE...

90
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:02,268
HE MADE MADE THAT
FOR ME AFTER SHE...

91
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:05,772
I LOVE THE WAY
HER HEAD MOVES.

92
00:05:05,807 --> 00:05:08,775
SHE ALMOST LOOKS...
ALIVE.

93
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:10,544
WATCH OUT!

94
00:05:10,579 --> 00:05:12,278
BYE-BYE!

95
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:28,795
AN ANGEL.

96
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:32,048
LITTLE GIRL?

97
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:33,765
YES, SIR?

98
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,803
I WANT YOU TO DO SOMETHING
VERY IMPORTANT, ALL RIGHT?

99
00:05:36,838 --> 00:05:37,769
OK.

100
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:40,306
I WANT YOU TO RUN HOME,
AND I WANT YOU TO CALL THE E.R.

101
00:05:40,341 --> 00:05:42,809
OF NORTH BANK GENERAL HOSPITAL,

102
00:05:42,844 --> 00:05:44,776
TELL THEM TO SET UP O.R. 6

105
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:51,818

WITH A PARAMEDIC CREW,

106
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:54,821
LIGHT I.V., D-5 AND W, KVO.
YOU GOT IT?

107

114
00:06:09,888 --> 00:06:11,302
THAT'S GOOD.

115
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:14,340
SOUNDS LIKE A SUBDURAL
HEMATOMA TO ME.

116
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:15,807
OH, IT DOES, DOES IT?

117
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:17,343
WELL, IT'S NOT YOUR JOB
TO DIAGNOSE.

118
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:18,810
BUT I THOUGHT-

119
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:20,812
YOU THOUGHT! YOU THOUGHT!
JUST GO!

120
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:22,849
3 YEARS OF NURSERY SCHOOL,
AND YOU THINK YOU KNOW IT ALL!

121
00:06:22,884 --> 00:06:24,816
WELL, YOU'RE STILL WET
BEHIND THE EARS.

122
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:27,854
IT'S NOT A SUBDURAL HEMATOMA!
IT'S EPIDURAL! HAH!

123
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:29,522
GODDAMN,
THAT MAKES ME MAD.

124
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:44,001
I DON'T FIND THIS AMUSING,
GARRERO!

125
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:46,038
THIS IS A BETTER STORY
THAN I EVER HOPED FOR.

126
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:48,005
BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
GETS HIT BY A CAR

127
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,042
AND NEEDS BRAIN SURGERY,
AND THE MAN WHO HITS HER

128
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:52,044
IS THE WORLD'S GREATEST
BRAIN SURGEON

129
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,546
WHO OPERATES ON HER
AND SAVES HER LIFE.

130
00:06:53,581 --> 00:06:55,513
IFI SAVE HER LIFE,
OLSEN.IF.

131
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:57,550
YOU WANTED TO SEE ME,
DR. BRANDON?

132
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,051
AH, YES, MICHAEL.

133
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:01,053
THIS OPERATION THAT
YOU'RE ABOUT TO PERFORM,

134
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:03,055
I FEEL,
IS VERY ILL-ADVISED.

135
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:05,057
NO SURGEON SHOULD EVER
OPERATE ON A PATIENT

136
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:06,524
THAT HE HAS PERSONALLY
INJURED.

137
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:08,561
IT WOULD MAKE HIM
TOO EMOTIONALLY INVOLVED.

138
00:07:08,596 --> 00:07:10,528
DON'T YOU THINK
I'M AWARE OF THAT?

139
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:12,064
BUT THERE'S ONLY ONE
OTHER PERSON I'D TRUST

140
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:14,031
TO PERFORM THIS
OPERATION-BECKERMANN.

141
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:16,569
DR. BECKERMANN WAS MURDERED
IN EUROPE. YOU KNOW THAT.

142
00:07:16,604 --> 00:07:17,535
EXACTLY!

143
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:22,575
NOT ONLY IS HE DEAD,
HE'S 6,000 MILES AWAY.

144
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:30,082
WHAT IS THAT?

145
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:34,086
It's a vagina.

146
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:36,053
I KNOW WHAT IT IS.

147
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:38,090
I MEAN
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

148
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,557
SHAVING HER.

149
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:42,595
THIS IS
A BRAIN OPERATION.

150
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,597
I KNOW.

151
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:46,599
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED
TO BE, A HEART?

152
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:48,566
YES, SIR.
CLIVE AND I THOUGHT

153
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:51,103
THAT SINCE IT'S
VALENTINE'S DAY THAT-

154
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:00,863
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
SHAVE HER ANYWHERE.

155
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:02,507
WE'LL BE USING
MY CRANIAL SCREWTOP

156
00:08:02,542 --> 00:08:04,116
METHOD OF ENTRY
INTO THE BRAIN.

157
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:05,082
FINE. YES, SIR.

158
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:07,369
I NEVER WANT
TO SEE THAT AGAIN.

159
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:09,514
I SUPPOSE
IF IT WERE CHRISTMAS,

160
00:08:09,549 --> 00:08:11,624
YOU'D HANG ORNAMENTS
ON IT.

SPONGE STICK.

166
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:44,156
GIVE ME A LITTLE SWEAT
ON MY UPPER LIP.

167
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:47,660
REMOVE SWEAT.

168
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:01,173
COVER HER BREASTS.
I'M A MAN, FLESH AND BLOOD.

169
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:06,679
SCAT!

170
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,649

CRANIAL SCREWTOP.

172
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:29,151
NOW ALL WE CAN DO IS WAIT.

173
00:09:29,186 --> 00:09:30,786
YES.

174
00:09:42,798 --> 00:09:44,800
WHERE AM I?

175
00:09:45,301 --> 00:09:47,303
IN A HOSPITAL.
YOU'VE HAD AN ACCIDENT.

176
00:09:47,338 --> 00:09:49,770
OH.

177
00:09:49,805 --> 00:09:52,308
I HOPE I HAVEN'T
CAUSED ANY TROUBLE.

178
00:09:52,343 --> 00:09:53,809
OH, NO.

179
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:55,811
Dolores:
I'M SO TIRED.

185
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:11,827
DOCTOR.

186
00:10:12,328 --> 00:10:12,828
HUH?

187
00:10:13,329 --> 00:10:16,832
YOU'RE WANTED IN O.R. 6

REBECCA.

194
00:11:06,382 --> 00:11:08,884
I CAN'T HELP
COMPARING HER TO YOU.

195
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:10,851
SHE HAS A BEHIND SO SEXY

196
00:11:10,886 --> 00:11:13,639
YOU'D LIKE TO EAT LUNCH
OFF IT.

00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:16,392
JUST LIKE WE DID,
REMEMBER?

198
00:11:16,892 --> 00:11:18,859
REBECCA.

199
00:11:18,894 --> 00:11:21,396
I'VE HAD THE TOP
OF HER HEAD OFF,

200
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,864
BUT THAT'S AS FAR
AS IT WENT.

201
00:11:23,899 --> 00:11:26,402
I PROMISE I'LL NEVER RECITE

MY LOVE DID DIE,

205
00:11:36,912 --> 00:11:39,415
AND NOW IN GROUND,
SHE'LL EVER LIE.

206
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:43,919
NONE COULD E'ER
REPLACE HER VISAGE,

207
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:45,886
UNTIL YOUR FACE

208
00:11:45,921 --> 00:11:47,923
BROUGHT THOUGHTS
OF KISSAGE.

209
00:12:01,937 --> 00:12:03,904
NURSE.

210
00:12:03,939 --> 00:12:05,441
GOOD.
I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

211
00:12:05,476 --> 00:12:06,442
MAKE A NOTE.

212

RIGHT ARM GRIP STRENGTH
VERY GOOD.

213
00:12:09,945 --> 00:12:13,449
LEFT ARM'S-THERE'S
JUST NO IMPROVEMENT.

214
00:12:17,453 --> 00:12:20,956

HE DIED IN 1894.

225
00:12:52,488 --> 00:12:56,492
HE WAS THE FIRST PERSON
EVER TO BE HIT BY A CAR.

226
00:12:56,527 --> 00:12:59,495
TO THINK YOU WERE
ALMOST KILLED BY A CAR.

227
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:01,462
MICHAEL.

228
00:13:01,497 --> 00:13:03,499
THAT'S ALL OVER NOW.

229
00:13:05,501 --> 00:13:07,503
THAT MAN YOU RAN AWAY
FROM THAT NIGHT...

230
00:13:07,538 --> 00:13:09,505
POOR OLD MR. CRESWELL.

231
00:13:12,508 --> 00:13:15,010
IT WAS ALL MY FAULT,
IN A WAY.

232
00:13:16,512 --> 00:13:20,015
I NEVER SHOULD HAVE
GONE THERE ALONE.

233
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:22,017
I GUESS I'M JUST
TOO TRUSTING.

234
00:13:22,518 --> 00:13:24,269
OH, POOR LITTLE BIRD.

235
00:13:26,056 --> 00:13:28,291
SO FRAGILE.

236
00:13:28,326 --> 00:13:30,176
SO NAIVE.

237
00:13:30,211 --> 00:13:32,027
SO CHILDLIKE.

238
00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:34,297
SO SHY.

239
00:13:34,332 --> 00:13:36,182
SO CHASTE.

240
00:13:36,217 --> 00:13:38,033
SO INNOCENT.

241
00:13:41,537 --> 00:13:43,003
REBECCA.

242
00:13:43,038 --> 00:13:44,004
IF THERE'S ANYTHING WRONG

243
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:46,542
WITH MY FEELINGS
FOR DOLORES,

244
00:13:46,577 --> 00:13:48,043
JUST GIVE ME A SIGN.

245
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:50,045
NO!

246

248
00:14:08,063 --> 00:14:12,032
NO!

249
00:14:12,067 --> 00:14:14,535
JUST ANY KIND OF SIGN.

250
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:17,573
I'LL KEEP ON THE LOOKOUT
FOR IT.

251
00:14:18,073 --> 00:14:20,042
MEANWHILE, I'LL JUST
PUT YOU IN THE CLOSET.

252
00:14:20,077 --> 00:14:22,512
IN SICKNESS
OR IN HEALTH

253
00:14:22,547 --> 00:14:24,947
TILL DEATH
DO YOU PART?

254
00:14:24,982 --> 00:14:26,413
I DO.

255
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:29,952
I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU
MAN AND WIFE.

256
00:14:29,987 --> 00:14:31,954
YOU MAY
KISS THE BRIDE.

257
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,962
NOT NOW.

258
00:14:57,479 --> 00:15:00,482
THERE IT IS, DARLING.
YOUR NEW HOME.

259
00:15:00,517 --> 00:15:03,951
THE HOUSE OF HFUHRUHURR.

260
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:06,488
WHAT ARE THOSE ASSHOLES
DOING ON THE PORCH?

261
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:09,992
THOSE AREN'T ASSHOLES.

262
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:12,494
IT'S PRONOUNCED "AZALEAS."

263
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:17,499
I PUT THEM THERE FOR YOU.

264
00:15:17,534 --> 00:15:18,966
SENOR.

265
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:21,253
NO, RAMON.
MY WIFE WILL NOT BE

266
00:15:21,288 --> 00:15:23,505
ENTERING HER NEW HOME
IN A WHEELCHAIR.

267
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:42,524
I WANT THIS MOMENT
TO LAST FOREVER.

268
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:52,499
SENOR?

269
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:56,038
SENOR, WOULD YOU LIKE TO
EAT YOUR BREAKFAST NOW?

270
00:15:56,073 --> 00:15:57,539
HAVE YOU TAKEN ENOUGH
PHOTOS OF THE MOMENT

271
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,042
SO WE CAN REMEMBER
THIS MOMENT FOREVER?

272
00:16:00,077 --> 00:16:01,008
OH, YES.

273
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:03,045
AND WE GOT THEM
BACK ALREADY. SEE?

274
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,511
OH, THAT'S NICE.

275
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:07,014
ALL RIGHT, BREAKFAST.

276
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:09,051
WE'LL GET CLEANED UP FIRST.

277
00:16:11,987 --> 00:16:13,689
ONE OF MY FAVORITE PEOPLE
IN THE WORLD

278
00:16:13,724 --> 00:16:16,156
IS ABOUT TO WALK OUT HERE.

279
00:16:16,191 --> 00:16:18,694
I'M HAPPY TO SAY HE IS
STILL BUSY MAKING HIS...

280
00:16:18,729 --> 00:16:20,195
LOOK,
I FRAMED THE MOMENT.

281
00:16:20,696 --> 00:16:21,662
MM-HMM.

282
00:16:21,697 --> 00:16:24,700
HE'S NOW ABOUT TO
UNVEIL HIS LATEST PICTURE,

283
00:16:24,735 --> 00:16:26,667
WHICH I HEAR IS JUST AMAZING,

284
00:16:26,702 --> 00:16:28,704
OPENING ON THE 21st
OF THIS MONTH-

285
00:16:36,211 --> 00:16:37,462
YUCK.

286
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:38,714
WAIT. TURN THAT BACK.

287
00:16:39,214 --> 00:16:39,715
THAT'S
MY FAVORITE MOVIE.

288
00:16:40,215 --> 00:16:41,682
THAT'SDONOVAN'S BRAIN.

289
00:16:41,717 --> 00:16:43,969
AND NOT THE SLIGHTEST
SIGN OF DECAY?

290
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:46,221
NONE. I'VE NEVER SEEN
HEALTHIER TISSUE.

291
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:48,724
IT'S GROWING LARGER
BY THE DAY.

292
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:50,743
IT'S DISGUSTING.

293
00:16:50,778 --> 00:16:52,503
BRAINS ARE SO UGLY.

294
00:16:52,538 --> 00:16:54,229
NO. IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

295
00:16:55,731 --> 00:16:57,197
I'M LATE!

296
00:16:57,232 --> 00:16:59,234
IS THAT ALL YOU'RE
GONNA HAVE FOR BREAKFAST?

297
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:00,736
IT'S ALL
I HAVE TIME FOR.

298
00:17:00,771 --> 00:17:02,255
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

299
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:03,739
OH, I'M FINE.

300
00:17:04,239 --> 00:17:06,742
I JUST... WISH I COULD
GET OUT OF THIS WHEELCHAIR

301
00:17:06,777 --> 00:17:09,244
SO I COULD HELP A LITTLE
AROUND THE HOUSE.

302
00:17:09,745 --> 00:17:10,711
YOU WILL.

303
00:17:10,746 --> 00:17:12,247
YOU JUST HAD
A MAJOR OPERATION.

304
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:14,214
IT TAKES TIME
TO RECOVER.

305
00:17:14,249 --> 00:17:15,250
YOU'RE GONNA BE UP
AND AROUND IN NO TIME.

306
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:16,752
JUST BE PATIENT.

307
00:17:18,754 --> 00:17:21,256
DOLORES? SOON?

308
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:25,260
HUH?

309
00:17:27,763 --> 00:17:29,514
HUH?

310
00:17:52,287 --> 00:17:53,288
Michael:
FORGOT MY HAT.

311
00:17:53,789 --> 00:17:54,755
OOH! OHH!

312
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:57,793
YOU WALKED! YOU WALKED!
YOU WALKED!

313
00:17:58,293 --> 00:18:01,296
I SHOULDN'T
HAVE GOTTEN UP,

314
00:18:01,797 --> 00:18:02,763
BUT I WANTED TO SURPRISE YOU

315
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:05,801
AND WALK INTO YOUR ARMS
TONIGHT WHEN YOU CAME HOME.

316
00:18:05,836 --> 00:18:09,304
YOU WALKED! YOU WALKED!
YOU WALKED!

317
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:11,271
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

318
00:18:11,306 --> 00:18:13,058
WHO IS THAT MAN OUT THERE?

319
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:14,810
JUAN.
HE WORKS FOR RAMON.

320
00:18:14,845 --> 00:18:16,777
OH. HE FRIGHTENED ME.

321
00:18:16,812 --> 00:18:19,314
HE'S JUST A BIG,
GOOD-NATURED BAG OF MUSCLES.

322
00:18:19,815 --> 00:18:22,818
THERE'S JUST SOMETHING ABOUT HIM
THAT MAKES ME QUIVER.

323
00:18:22,853 --> 00:18:24,587
IS HE HERE OFTEN?

324
00:18:24,622 --> 00:18:26,321
JUST ONE DAY A WEEK.

325
00:18:26,356 --> 00:18:27,840
WHAT DAY?

326
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:29,289
TUESDAY.

327
00:18:29,324 --> 00:18:30,791
IS HE EVER ALONE?

328
00:18:30,826 --> 00:18:35,831
I MEAN, DOES RAMON EVER GO OFF
AND LEAVE HIM HERE ALONE?

329
00:18:35,866 --> 00:18:37,850
SOMETIMES. WHY?

330
00:18:37,885 --> 00:18:39,800
I'D LIKE TO KNOW.

331
00:18:39,835 --> 00:18:43,804
PLEASE,
TELL RAMON TO WARN ME

332
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:47,342
WHEN HE'S GONNA LEAVE ME
ALONE WITH THAT JUAN PERSON.

333
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:49,845
ALL RIGHT, IF THAT'LL
MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER.

334
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,847
THAT'LL MAKE ME
FEEL MUCH BETTER.

335
00:18:51,882 --> 00:18:54,850
FRIGHTENED LITTLE MOUSE.

336
00:19:00,355 --> 00:19:02,322
I'LL TELL RAMON

337
00:19:02,357 --> 00:19:05,360
TO WARN HER
ABOUT JUAN.

338
00:19:06,897 --> 00:19:08,864
RAMON!

339
00:19:09,264 --> 00:19:11,867
MICHAEL, MICHAEL,
HOW IS MARRIED LIFE?

340
00:19:11,902 --> 00:19:12,833
I DON'T KNOW!

341
00:19:12,868 --> 00:19:14,870
I'M SORRY.
I'VE BEEN ON EDGE

342
00:19:14,905 --> 00:19:16,639
THE LAST COUPLE
OF WEEKS.

343
00:19:16,674 --> 00:19:18,373
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M DOING.

344
00:19:18,874 --> 00:19:19,374
MICHAEL!

345
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:21,376
AAH!

346
00:19:21,877 --> 00:19:23,343
SEE? THAT'S
A PERFECT EXAMPLE.

347
00:19:23,378 --> 00:19:25,881
OH, GOD, I ALMOST PEED
IN THE SCRUB BASIN.

348
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:27,883
I DON'T KNOW WHY
I'VE BEEN SO TENSE.

349
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:30,886
MAYBE IT'S YOUR COFFEE.

350
00:19:32,387 --> 00:19:33,388
NO.

351
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:37,893
WHEN A WOMAN WHO'S JUST
HAD MAJOR BRAIN SURGERY

352
00:19:37,928 --> 00:19:39,394
TELLS YOU SHE
HAS A HEADACHE,

353
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:40,395
YOU'VE GOT TO LISTEN.

354
00:19:40,896 --> 00:19:43,363
OH.

355
00:19:43,398 --> 00:19:44,865
PATIENCE, MICHAEL.

356
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:47,402
A RECENTLY MARRIED WOMAN
AND AN EAGER YOUNG HUSBAND-

357
00:19:47,437 --> 00:19:49,404
IT WON'T BE LONG
BEFORE YOU HEAR HER SAY,

358
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:50,923
"TAKE ME! TAKE ME!"

359
00:19:52,718 --> 00:19:54,409
TAKE ME.

360
00:19:56,912 --> 00:19:58,413
TAKE ME.

361
00:20:02,918 --> 00:20:04,920
OHH.

362
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:07,422
OHH, JUAN.

363
00:20:07,457 --> 00:20:09,424
YOU...

364
00:20:11,426 --> 00:20:12,677
YOU'RE THROUGH!

365
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:13,929
I DON'T THINK I AM.

366
00:20:13,964 --> 00:20:15,430
NOT YOU.

367
00:20:17,933 --> 00:20:20,901
BY THE WAY, I FIRED
RAMON YESTERDAY.

368
00:20:20,936 --> 00:20:24,439
RAMON? BUT RAMON IS SUCH
A FINE MAN. WHAT DID HE DO?

369
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:27,943
HE CAME UP BEHIND ME,
AND HE GRABBED MY BREASTS.

370
00:20:27,978 --> 00:20:29,945
WHAT?

371
00:20:31,947 --> 00:20:33,949
IHAVEN'T EVEN
DONE THAT YET.

372
00:20:33,984 --> 00:20:35,450
I KNOW. I TOLD HIM THAT.

373
00:20:35,951 --> 00:20:36,917
YOU TOLD HIM?

374
00:20:36,952 --> 00:20:38,954
HE SAID HE HAD
TO MEASURE ME

375
00:20:38,989 --> 00:20:40,921
FOR A NEW
DASHBOARD ORNAMENT.

376
00:20:40,956 --> 00:20:43,959
HE TOLD ME HE HAD TO
MEASURE REBECCA A LOT

377
00:20:43,994 --> 00:20:45,961
BEFORE HE GOT HER RIGHT.

378
00:20:49,464 --> 00:20:52,968
OH, YOU'RE UPSET.

379
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:57,472
SO AM I.

380
00:20:57,973 --> 00:21:00,976
I WANT TO BE EVERYTHING
TO YOU REBECCA WAS.

381
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:07,983
I WANT TO GIVE YOU...
EVERYTHING SHE GAVE YOU,

382
00:21:08,018 --> 00:21:10,986
DO EVERYTHING SHE DID.

383
00:21:14,489 --> 00:21:15,991
WHEN CAN YOU START?

384
00:21:16,491 --> 00:21:18,458
HOW SOON
CAN YOU GET HOME?

385
00:21:18,493 --> 00:21:21,997
WELL, I HAVE 2 OPERATIONS,
BUT I CAN DO THEM FAST.

386
00:21:22,032 --> 00:21:23,999
THEY'RE JUST
BRAIN OPERATIONS.

387
00:21:26,001 --> 00:21:28,003
LET ME GET MY HAT.

388
00:21:28,503 --> 00:21:29,504
MY BRIEFCASE.

389
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:38,013
COULD YOU WALK ME
TO THE DOOR?

390
00:21:47,022 --> 00:21:48,488
WHAT'S HE DOING?

391
00:21:48,523 --> 00:21:51,526
2 BRAIN OPERATIONS
AT THE SAME TIME.

392
00:21:51,561 --> 00:21:52,527
NUMBER 11-BLADE.

393
00:21:52,562 --> 00:21:53,493
11-BLADE.

394
00:21:53,528 --> 00:21:54,529
10-BLADE SCALPEL.

395
00:21:54,564 --> 00:21:55,495
10-BLADE.

396
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:58,033
READY THE BONE WAX.
METZENBAUM SCISSORS.

397
00:21:58,068 --> 00:21:59,034
METZENBAUM SCISSORS.

398
00:22:00,035 --> 00:22:01,036
GET THAT CAT
OUT OF HERE.

399
00:22:01,071 --> 00:22:03,003
YES, SIR.

400
00:22:03,038 --> 00:22:05,040
WE'RE READY TO CLOSE.
CRANIAL SCREWTOPS.

401
00:22:08,043 --> 00:22:10,545
CHECK FOR STRIPPING.
TAKE THEM TO SICU.

402
00:22:11,046 --> 00:22:13,548
BRAVO!
BRAVO!

403
00:22:21,056 --> 00:22:22,057
YOU'RE SO EARLY.

404
00:22:22,092 --> 00:22:23,058
YES.

405
00:22:23,558 --> 00:22:25,560
TAKE OFF YOUR COAT.

406
00:22:27,562 --> 00:22:29,064
AND YOUR PAPER HAT.

407
00:22:30,565 --> 00:22:32,567
I'M CHILLING
SOME WINE FOR US.

408
00:22:32,602 --> 00:22:34,069
WHY DON'T YOU OPEN IT?

409
00:22:34,104 --> 00:22:35,070
YES.

410
00:22:58,093 --> 00:23:00,595
DOES THIS
DO ANYTHING FOR YOU?

411
00:23:01,096 --> 00:23:02,347
OH, YES.

412
00:23:02,382 --> 00:23:03,598
GOOD.

413
00:23:09,104 --> 00:23:11,606
I WANT OUR FIRST NIGHT
TOGETHER...

414
00:23:11,641 --> 00:23:13,108
TO BE EXCITING.

415
00:23:13,143 --> 00:23:14,109
I DO, TOO.

416
00:23:14,609 --> 00:23:17,612
I HOPE THE WAITING
HASN'T BEEN TOO HARD ON YOU.

417
00:23:19,114 --> 00:23:22,617
THERE'S SOMETHING
I HAVE TO TELL YOU.

418
00:23:22,652 --> 00:23:25,585
THIS FITS VERY SNUG,

419
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:29,124
AND YOU MAY HAVE SOME TROUBLE
GETTING IT OFF ME.

420
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:31,126
YOU MAY HAVE TO
TEAR IT OFF MY BODY.

421
00:23:31,161 --> 00:23:34,129
I CAN TEAR.
I LIKE TEARING.

422
00:23:37,132 --> 00:23:40,135
YOU... MAN OF STEEL.

423
00:23:46,641 --> 00:23:50,145
I CAN'T WAIT
TILL NEXT THURSDAY.

424
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:57,152
TODAY IS MONDAY.

425
00:23:57,187 --> 00:23:58,118
I KNOW.

426
00:23:58,153 --> 00:24:02,157
BUT MY HEADACHE
SHOULD BE GONE BY THEN.

427
00:24:02,192 --> 00:24:04,159
YOU DON'T MIND WAITING,
DO YOU?

428
00:24:04,194 --> 00:24:06,126
OH. NO.

429
00:24:06,161 --> 00:24:08,628
NO, NO, NO.
NOT AT ALL.

430
00:24:08,663 --> 00:24:10,665
I HAVE A LITTLE
HEADACHE MYSELF.

431
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,666
MAYBE I'LL TAKE A WALK.

432
00:24:12,167 --> 00:24:14,669
IT'LL DO ME GOOD.

433
00:24:16,671 --> 00:24:18,673
WHERE'S MY HAT?

434
00:24:19,674 --> 00:24:21,641
IT'S...

435
00:24:26,681 --> 00:24:28,683
THE BREEZE FEELS GOOD.

436
00:24:29,951 --> 00:24:31,436
YOU WANTED TO SEE ME?

437
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:35,440
MICHAEL, I'M, UH,
CONCERNED ABOUT YOU.

438
00:24:35,475 --> 00:24:37,442
REALLY?
WHAT'S THE CONCERN?

439
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:41,947
MY STAFF TELLS ME THAT YOU'VE
BEEN A LITTLE TENSE LATELY.

440
00:24:42,447 --> 00:24:43,448
TENSE?

441
00:24:46,451 --> 00:24:49,419
IS THAT WHAT
THEY SAY ABOUT ME?

442
00:24:49,454 --> 00:24:53,458
MICHAEL, EVEN TO ME,
YOU SEEM A LITTLE JUMPY.

443
00:24:53,493 --> 00:24:54,424
JUMPY?!

444
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:55,961
HOW ARE THINGS
AT HOME, MICHAEL?

445
00:24:56,461 --> 00:24:58,964
GREAT. I'M MARRIED TO THE MOST
BEAUTIFUL WOMAN IN THE WORLD.

446
00:24:58,999 --> 00:25:00,966
HOW COULD IT BE ANYTHING
BUT GREAT?!

447
00:25:01,466 --> 00:25:03,468
IT'S GONNA BE EVEN GREATER!

448
00:25:03,503 --> 00:25:05,470
JUST AS SOON AS WE...

449
00:25:07,472 --> 00:25:09,975
6 WEEKS AND YOU HAVEN'T
MADE LOVE TO YOUR WIFE YET?

450
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:10,976
NO WONDER YOU'RE TENSE.

451
00:25:11,476 --> 00:25:14,980
DR. BRANDON, THE WOMAN HAS
JUST HAD MAJOR BRAIN SURGERY.

452
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,983
SHE'S HAD ENOUGH
UNPLEASANTNESS.

453
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:23,488
I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW THAT IN
THE FINGER-SUCKING DEPARTMENT

454
00:25:23,523 --> 00:25:26,992
I AM EXTREMELY SATISFIED.

455
00:25:32,497 --> 00:25:33,498
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN
TO AUSTRIA, MICHAEL?

456
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:34,499
NO.

457
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,466
THE AUSTRIAN INSTITUTE
OF CRANIOLOGY

458
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:38,503
HAS ASKED MANY TIMES
FOR YOU TO LECTURE THERE

459
00:25:38,538 --> 00:25:41,006
ON YOUR THEORY
OF BRAIN TRANSPLANTS.

460
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:42,973
WHY NOT
TAKE THEM UP ON IT?

461
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:46,511
COMBINE A BUSINESS TRIP
WITH A HONEYMOON.

462
00:25:46,546 --> 00:25:48,478
HONEYMOON.

463
00:25:48,513 --> 00:25:51,516
YEAH. I GOT TO DO SOMETHING
TO GET US STARTED.

464
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:52,983
WHEN ARE YOU SCHEDULED

465
00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:55,020
TO HAVE YOUR HANDS
REMOVED FROM YOUR FACE?

466
00:25:55,055 --> 00:25:55,986
3:00 THIS AFTERNOON.

467
00:25:56,021 --> 00:25:57,522
THEN YOU COULD DO
THE VOITLANDER SURGERY FOR ME.

468
00:25:57,557 --> 00:25:58,989
OF COURSE!

469
00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:01,526
HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL
WITH THAT INSTANT GLUE.

470
00:26:01,561 --> 00:26:02,527
I KNOW.

471
00:26:03,028 --> 00:26:04,029
HERE'S
THE VOITLANDER CHART.

472
00:26:04,064 --> 00:26:06,549
A HONEYMOON.

473
00:26:06,584 --> 00:26:09,034
YEAH. HONEYMOON!

474
00:26:29,554 --> 00:26:31,055
MAY I HELP YOU, SIR?

475
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,522
YES, I'M DR. HFUHRUHURR.

476
00:26:32,557 --> 00:26:34,024
I BELIEVE YOU'RE HOLDING
A ROOM FOR ME.

477
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:40,065
YES. WOULD YOU PREFER
A DOUBLE OR TWIN BEDS?

478
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:45,070
A DOUBLE.

479
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:47,537
AH, A DOUBLE.

480
00:26:47,572 --> 00:26:49,824
COULD YOU SEND UP
A BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE

481
00:26:49,859 --> 00:26:52,077
AND PUT A "DO NOT DISTURB"
ON THE PHONE

482
00:26:52,112 --> 00:26:55,045
FOR THE NEXT-
UM, LET'S SEE.

483
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,582
WE GO IN, PUT OUR BAGS DOWN
START KISSING,

484
00:26:58,083 --> 00:26:59,549
BE ABOUT 7 MINUTES.

485
00:26:59,584 --> 00:27:01,586
MOVE INTO THE BEDROOM,
SLIDE MY HANDS OVER HER DRESS,

486
00:27:02,087 --> 00:27:05,090
I REMOVE HER BLOUSE,
MAYBE 4 OR 5 MINUTES.

487
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:08,093
MOVE OVER TO THE BED,
RUB EACH INNER THIGH,

488
00:27:08,128 --> 00:27:10,060
THAT WOULD BE
4 MINUTES EACH,

489
00:27:10,095 --> 00:27:12,097
SO I FIGURE 25 MINUTES
OF FOREPLAY IN GENERAL...

490
00:27:13,598 --> 00:27:17,852
DO YOU CALL ORAL SEX
FOREPLAY OR ACTUAL SEX?

491
00:27:17,887 --> 00:27:22,107
DOESN'T MATTER.
I'D LIKE TO DO IT TWICE,

492
00:27:22,607 --> 00:27:24,109
SO AT LEAST 3 HOURS,
ALL RIGHT?

493
00:27:24,144 --> 00:27:26,576
3 HOURS?!

494
00:27:26,611 --> 00:27:28,613
YES, SIR.

495
00:27:30,615 --> 00:27:34,619
TAKE MRS. HFUHRUHURR AND
THAT LUCKY SON OF A BITCH

496
00:27:34,654 --> 00:27:37,122
UP TO SUITE 729.

497
00:27:37,157 --> 00:27:38,588
YES, SIR.

498
00:27:42,127 --> 00:27:44,879
I NEVER IN
MY WILDEST IMAGINATION

499
00:27:44,914 --> 00:27:47,597
EVER THOUGHT IT
COULD BE LIKE THAT.

500
00:27:47,632 --> 00:27:51,136
IT WAS THE MOST EXCITING
SEXUAL ENCOUNTER-

501
00:27:51,171 --> 00:27:55,140
WITHOUT ACTUALLY
HAVING IT-

502
00:27:55,175 --> 00:27:59,394
THAT I EVER ALMOST HAD.

503
00:28:08,403 --> 00:28:10,370
DOCTOR, I'M
DR. FELIX CONRAD.

504
00:28:10,405 --> 00:28:11,906
I'LL BE ESCORTING YOU
TO THE LECTURE HALL.

505
00:28:11,941 --> 00:28:13,408
DID YOU JUST STEP OFF
THAT ELEVATOR?

506
00:28:13,443 --> 00:28:14,927
THERE WAS NO OPERATOR.

507
00:28:14,962 --> 00:28:16,376
THEY'RE ALL AFRAID.

508
00:28:16,411 --> 00:28:18,413
YOU HAVEN'T HEARD ABOUT
VIENNA'S ELEVATOR KILLER?

509
00:28:18,448 --> 00:28:19,379
ELEVATOR KILLER?

510
00:28:19,414 --> 00:28:22,417
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN GETTING
ON ELEVATORS ON ONE FLOOR

511
00:28:22,452 --> 00:28:25,420
ONLY TO ARRIVE AT
ANOTHER FLOOR DEAD.

512
00:28:25,455 --> 00:28:26,886
LIKE BECKERMAN.

513
00:28:26,921 --> 00:28:28,923
JA.DR. SCHLERMIE
BECKERMAN.

514
00:28:29,424 --> 00:28:31,426
A BRILLIANT
BRAIN SURGEON.

515
00:28:31,461 --> 00:28:33,195
ONE OF
YOUR COLLEAGUES.

516
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:34,894
IT WAS A GREAT LOSS.

517
00:28:34,929 --> 00:28:36,430
I'M THANKFUL
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

518
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:37,897
THE ACADEMY
IS LOOKING FORWARD

519
00:28:37,932 --> 00:28:39,684
TO HEARING YOU
LECTURE THIS MORNING.

520
00:28:39,719 --> 00:28:41,401
I HOPE I DON'T RUFFLE
ANY FEATHERS.

521
00:28:41,436 --> 00:28:43,938
MY SPEECH MIGHT BE A LITTLE
RADICAL FOR THE OLD GUARD.

522
00:28:43,973 --> 00:28:45,940
IT WOULD
TAKE QUITE A BIT

523
00:28:45,975 --> 00:28:47,942
TO SHOCK
ANY OF THIS CROWD.

524
00:28:48,443 --> 00:28:50,945
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
I CAN ENVISION A DAY

525
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:53,413
WHEN THE BRAINS
OF BRILLIANT MEN

526
00:28:53,448 --> 00:28:56,451
CAN BE KEPT ALIVE IN
THE BODIES OF DUMB PEOPLE.

527
00:29:00,455 --> 00:29:02,422
WHAT ARE THEY SAYING?

528
00:29:02,457 --> 00:29:05,460
THEY'RE JUST SAYING
"MURMUR MURMUR MURMUR."

529
00:29:05,495 --> 00:29:07,462
IT'S JUST SORT OF
A GENERAL MURMUR?

530
00:29:07,497 --> 00:29:08,963
YEAH. MURMUR.

531
00:29:09,464 --> 00:29:09,964
OH.

532
00:29:10,465 --> 00:29:13,468
YOU MAY MURMUR
ALL YOU LIKE-

533
00:29:16,471 --> 00:29:18,938
BUT TO MAKE
TRANSPLANTATION POSSIBLE

534
00:29:18,973 --> 00:29:21,476
I HAVE RECENTLY INVENTED
THE CRANIAL SCREWTOP METHOD

535
00:29:21,976 --> 00:29:24,979
OF ENTRY INTO THE BRAIN
WHEREBY A LARGE SECTION

536
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:28,733
CAN BE UNSCREWED WITHOUT
HAVING TO SHAVE THE HEAD.

537
00:29:28,768 --> 00:29:31,986
AND AS A SAFETY FEATURE,
I'VE MADE IT CHILDPROOF.

538
00:29:32,021 --> 00:29:36,491
TO OPEN, YOU PUSH DOWN
WHILE TURNING...

539
00:29:38,993 --> 00:29:42,497
AND VOIL?,
THE HUMAN BRAIN.

540
00:29:49,003 --> 00:29:50,970
WHERE IS
THIS MAN'S BRAIN?

541
00:29:51,005 --> 00:29:54,008
STOLEN! IT'S THE FOURTH
INCIDENT THIS MONTH.

542
00:29:54,043 --> 00:29:57,011
I WISH TO APOLOGIZE TO
OUR AMERICAN COLLEAGUE.

543
00:29:57,046 --> 00:30:00,014
THIS DEMONSTRATION
IS NOW CONCLUDED.

544
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:09,974
DR. HMFHRUHRR?

545
00:30:10,009 --> 00:30:11,691
IT'S CLOSE. YES?

546
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:15,230
I'M DR. ALFRED NECESSITER.

547
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:19,234
WELL, WELL, WELL.
DR. ALFRED NECESSITER.

548
00:30:19,269 --> 00:30:20,700
WOULD YOU LIKE A DRINK?

549
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:23,738
A DRINK WOULD BE
INTERESTING.

550
00:30:23,773 --> 00:30:26,706
I ENJOYED
YOUR LECTURE TODAY.

551
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:29,244
WHAT LECTURE? THEY GAVE ME
A HEAD WITH 3 LEMONS IN IT.

552
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:31,246
THAT'S WHY
I ENJOYED IT SO MUCH.

553
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:33,248
I DIDN'T HAVE TO HEAR YOUR
BRILLIANT BUT OLD-FASHIONED

554
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:35,215
THEORIES ON THE HUMAN BRAIN.

555
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,716
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"OLD-FASHIONED"?

556
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:39,754
I'M THE MOST ADVANCED
BRAIN MAN WORKING TODAY.

557
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:41,221
I DON'T THINK SO.

558
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:45,260
READ THIS ARTICLE.
LOOK AT THE UNDERLINED PART.

559
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,764
AND LOOK AT THIS. READ
THE CAPTION UNDER THE PHOTO.

560
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:55,270
AND THESE-
NEWSWEEK, TIME, COSMO.

561
00:30:55,305 --> 00:30:56,236
NATIONAL ENQUIRER-

562
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:58,273
DOLLY PARTON WANTS
TO HAVE MY BABY.

563
00:30:58,308 --> 00:31:00,292
DON'T TELL ME
I'M OLD-FASHIONED.

564
00:31:00,327 --> 00:31:02,242
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO UPSET YOU, DOCTOR!

565
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:04,779
YOU'RE THE MOST BRILLIANT
BRAIN MAN WORKING TODAY.

566
00:31:04,814 --> 00:31:07,049
THAT'S WHY I'M MOST ANXIOUS
TO SHARE MY WORK WITH YOU.

567
00:31:07,084 --> 00:31:09,284
IT SEEMS YOU'RE THE ONE PERSON
IN THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE

568
00:31:09,319 --> 00:31:10,750
WHO MIGHT UNDERSTAND IT.

569
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:14,754
AND I AGREE WITH WHAT
YOU SAID HERE.

570
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:17,792
"MY BRILLIANT RESEARCH
IN BRAIN TRANSPLANTATION

571
00:31:17,827 --> 00:31:20,795
"IS UNSURPASSED AND WILL
PROBABLY MAKE MY NAME

572
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:24,264
LIVE BEYOND ETERNITY."

573
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:27,051
I TOLD HIM TO TAKE OUT
THE "PROBABLY."

574
00:31:27,086 --> 00:31:29,769
MY LABORATORY
IS SET UP IN MY HOME.

575
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:32,807
IF YOU HAVE A MOMENT,
I COULD SHOW YOU MY WORK.

576
00:31:32,842 --> 00:31:34,576
WHEN?

577
00:31:34,611 --> 00:31:36,276
NOW!

578
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:38,278
ALL RIGHT.

579
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:41,065
I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY DIDN'T
TAKE OUT THE "PROBABLY."

580
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,818
YOU KNOW, THAT PHOTOGRAPH
DOESN'T DO YOU JUSTICE.

581
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,797
WELL, HELLO.

582
00:31:57,832 --> 00:31:59,834
I DIDN'T EXPECT
TO SEE YOU HERE.

583
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:03,471
OW! OH, YOU DIRTY...

584
00:32:11,479 --> 00:32:12,981
Necessiter:
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

585
00:32:13,481 --> 00:32:14,983
YOU'LL HAVE TO FORGIVE ME.

586
00:32:15,483 --> 00:32:19,237
BEING IN AUSTRIA AND MEETING
A SCIENTIST WITH YOUR INTERESTS,

587
00:32:19,272 --> 00:32:22,991
I HALF EXPECTED YOUR LABORATORY
TO BE IN A CASTLE, NOT A CONDO.

588
00:32:23,026 --> 00:32:25,458
YOU MEAN... LIKE THIS?

589
00:32:25,493 --> 00:32:28,496
YEAH.
THAT'S MORE LIKE IT.

590
00:32:28,997 --> 00:32:30,498
JESUS.

591
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:35,969
THIS IS EXTRAORDINARY.

592
00:32:36,004 --> 00:32:38,506
FROM THE OUTSIDE,
IT DOES NOT LOOK THIS ROOMY.

593
00:32:38,541 --> 00:32:40,974
I HAD A GOOD DECORATOR.
MY WIFE.

594
00:32:41,009 --> 00:32:43,511
IT'S AMAZING WHAT SHE DID
WITH A FEW THROW PILLOWS,

595
00:32:43,546 --> 00:32:46,014
SOME WALLPAPER,
AND A STAPLE GUN.

596
00:32:46,049 --> 00:32:47,032
LEAPIN' LIZARDS.

597
00:32:47,067 --> 00:32:48,016
YES. WE HAVE THOSE.

598
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:52,986
MOAT WITH ALLIGATOR...

599
00:32:53,021 --> 00:32:55,773
HERE'S OUR SMALL
ENTRANCE HALL.

600
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:58,526
DO YOU HAVE ENOUGH
CLOSET SPACE?

601
00:32:58,561 --> 00:32:59,993
THERE NEVER IS.

602
00:33:00,028 --> 00:33:01,529
NO. THEY FILL UP
SO FAST.

603
00:33:01,564 --> 00:33:02,996
THIS IS THE TV ROOM.

604
00:33:03,031 --> 00:33:05,033
OH, I LOVE THE WAY
IT'S SO DREARY.

605
00:33:05,533 --> 00:33:07,535
THIS, DOCTOR...

606
00:33:08,036 --> 00:33:09,537
IS MY LABORATORY.

607
00:33:14,542 --> 00:33:17,010
BRAINS.

608
00:33:17,045 --> 00:33:22,050
I'VE NEVER SEEN SO MANY BRAINS
OUT OF THEIR HEADS BEFORE.

609
00:33:24,052 --> 00:33:25,553
FEEL LIKE A KID
IN A CANDY STORE.

610
00:33:26,054 --> 00:33:29,057
DON'T TOUCH IT!

611
00:33:29,092 --> 00:33:30,023
WHY?

612
00:33:30,058 --> 00:33:32,560
THEY'RE ALIVE.

613
00:33:35,063 --> 00:33:36,564
ALIVE.

614
00:33:40,068 --> 00:33:43,571
BUT THERE'S NO WIRES OR
TUBES OR THAT "BZZ" THING.

615
00:33:43,606 --> 00:33:45,038
HOW ARE THEY KEPT ALIVE?

616
00:33:45,073 --> 00:33:47,075
WITH A SPECIAL FLUID
I DEVELOPED.

617
00:33:53,581 --> 00:33:56,334
WHY DO YOU HAVE
ALL THESE BRAINS?

618
00:33:56,369 --> 00:33:59,052
MY VISION IS
TO BE ABLE TO TAKE

619
00:33:59,087 --> 00:34:02,090
THE THOUGHTS AND DATA
FROM A DYING BRAIN

620
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:05,593
AND TRANSFER THEM
INTO ANOTHER BODY

621
00:34:05,628 --> 00:34:09,097
WITHOUT OPENING
THE SKULL.

622
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,602
WOULD YOU CARE
FOR A DRINK?

623
00:34:14,637 --> 00:34:16,069
PLEASE.

624
00:34:16,104 --> 00:34:17,355
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE?

625
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:18,606
A TAHITIAN LADY.

626
00:34:18,641 --> 00:34:20,125
RIGHT-O.

627
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,609
FLAMING?

628
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:24,112
OH, NO, NO.
THAT'S FOR TOURISTS.

629
00:34:24,147 --> 00:34:26,114
WHERE DO YOU GET
YOUR BRAINS?

630
00:34:26,614 --> 00:34:27,580
THE CITY MORGUE.

631
00:34:27,615 --> 00:34:30,118
FOR A NICE TIP THEY SEND
ME BRAINS FROM BODIES

632
00:34:30,153 --> 00:34:32,085
THAT HAVE DIED
IN THE RIGHT WAY.

633
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,872
WHAT IS THE RIGHT WAY
FOR A BODY TO DIE?

634
00:34:34,907 --> 00:34:37,625
FOR MY PURPOSE,
AN INJECTION OF 200 CCs

635
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:39,627
OF AMMONIATED
STRYCHNOCLORAHYPE

636
00:34:39,662 --> 00:34:41,594
INTO THE BUTTOCKS,

637
00:34:41,629 --> 00:34:45,133
CAUSING THE BRAIN
TO DIE LAST.

638
00:34:45,633 --> 00:34:47,135
THANK YOU.

639
00:34:47,635 --> 00:34:49,137
AMMONIATED STRYCH-
THAT'S WINDOW CLEANER.

640
00:34:49,637 --> 00:34:51,639
THAT'S THE EXACT INGREDIENTS
IN WINDOW CLEANER.

641
00:34:51,674 --> 00:34:53,141
YES.

642
00:34:57,645 --> 00:35:01,649
AND WHO DOES THE INJECTING,
DR. NECESSITER, YOU?

643
00:35:01,684 --> 00:35:04,117
GOOD LORD, NO.

644
00:35:04,152 --> 00:35:07,120
IT'S THE ELEVATOR KILLER,
BLESS HIS HEART.

645
00:35:07,155 --> 00:35:09,657
YOU'RE CONDONING MURDER,
AREN'T YOU, DR. NECESSITER?

646
00:35:09,692 --> 00:35:12,160
AS LONG AT IT'S HAPPENING,
I'M HAPPY TO ACCEPT IT.

647
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:14,162
THE ONLY TIME WE DOCTORS
SHOULD ACCEPT DEATH

648
00:35:14,662 --> 00:35:16,914
IS WHEN IT'S CAUSED
BY OUR OWN INCOMPETENCE.

649
00:35:16,949 --> 00:35:19,167
NONSENSE! IF THE MURDER
OF 12 INNOCENT PEOPLE

650
00:35:19,667 --> 00:35:21,669
CAN SAVE ONE HUMAN LIFE,
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WORTH IT.

651
00:35:21,704 --> 00:35:24,172
WORTH IT?
YOU'RE CONDONING MURDER!

652
00:35:24,672 --> 00:35:26,174
I'M NOT CONDONING
MURDER, SIR!

653
00:35:26,674 --> 00:35:28,176
Woman:
SHUT UP IN THERE!

654
00:35:28,676 --> 00:35:30,178
RESEARCH AND MURDER
DO NOT GO TOGETHER!

655
00:35:30,213 --> 00:35:32,145
AND YOU SHUT UP!

656
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:34,647
WITH YOUR TV
BLARING ALL NIGHT

657
00:35:34,682 --> 00:35:37,185
AND YOUR 6 GRANDCHILDREN
RUNNING DOWN THE HALLS!

658
00:35:39,187 --> 00:35:42,190
I'M SORRY, DOCTOR.
THESE WALLS LOOK SOLID,

659
00:35:42,225 --> 00:35:44,692
BUT THEY'RE THIN
AS TISSUE PAPER.

660
00:35:44,727 --> 00:35:49,197
THAT'S TYPICAL
FOR A CONDO.

661
00:35:49,232 --> 00:35:51,164
NOW, LET ME SHOW YOU

662
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:54,202
HOW FAR I'VE PROGRESSED
WITH MY EXPERIMENTS.

663
00:35:54,237 --> 00:35:56,169
YOU KNEW
A SCHLERMIE BECKERMAN?

664
00:35:56,204 --> 00:35:58,206
YOU'VE GOT SCHLERMIE
IN ONE OF THOSE JARS

665
00:35:58,241 --> 00:35:59,672
LIKE SO MUCH MARMALADE?

666
00:35:59,707 --> 00:36:02,960
NO! HE ISN'T IN A JAR!
HE'S WALKING AND TALKING.

667
00:36:02,995 --> 00:36:06,214
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
I SAW PHOTOS OF THE BODY.

668
00:36:06,249 --> 00:36:08,716
ITISPOSSIBLE.

669
00:36:10,218 --> 00:36:12,720
I MUST WARN YOU, DOCTOR...

670
00:36:12,755 --> 00:36:15,188
WHAT YOU ARE ABOUT TO SEE...

671
00:36:15,223 --> 00:36:19,227
MIGHT STRIKE YOU AS
THE MOST INCREDIBLE, AWESOME-

672
00:36:20,763 --> 00:36:22,230
EXCUSE ME.

673
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:24,482
INCREDIBLE,
AWESOME WHAT?

674
00:36:24,517 --> 00:36:26,234
JUST A MINUTE.
HELLO? YES?

675
00:36:26,734 --> 00:36:28,236
I'LL BE THERE IMMEDIATELY.
THANK YOU.

676
00:36:28,271 --> 00:36:29,202
WHAT WAS
THAT AWESOME THING?

677
00:36:29,237 --> 00:36:31,739
I MUST LEAVE NOW.
I HAVE A NEW BRAIN TO PICK.

678
00:36:31,774 --> 00:36:32,740
THE ELEVATOR KILLER
HAS STRUCK AGAIN.

679
00:36:33,241 --> 00:36:35,208
WHAT ABOUT BECKERMAN
AND INCREDIBLE?

680
00:36:35,243 --> 00:36:38,246
COME FOR DINNER TONIGHT
AND BRING MRS. FURREAR.

681
00:36:38,281 --> 00:36:39,712
HFUHRUHURR.
HFUHRUHURR.

682
00:36:39,747 --> 00:36:42,250
8:00. YOU CAN LET
YOURSELF OUT.

683
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:12,647
NOW, IF YOU WILL
JUST TURN AROUND.

684
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:19,153
UNDLIFT YOUR ROBE.

685
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:31,165
JA.

686
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:49,183
Michael:
HI. WHAT'S GOING ON?

687
00:37:49,218 --> 00:37:50,650
DON'T INTERFERE.

688
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:55,189
HE'S PAYING ME $15,000
JUST TO TOUCH MY BEHIND.

689
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:57,942
YOU! GET OUTTA HERE!

690
00:37:57,977 --> 00:37:59,193

GET OUT!

692
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:03,698
THIS KIND OF THING
COULD RUIN OUR MARRIAGE.

693
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:06,951
WHY? BECAUSE YOU
DON'T WANT ME TO WORK?

694
00:38:06,986 --> 00:38:09,704
EARN MY OWN MONEY?
HAVE MY OWN CAREER?

695
00:38:09,739 --> 00:38:11,671
YOU CALL THIS A CAREER?

696
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:14,709
OH, I'VE MADE THOSE VEINS
IN YOUR TEMPLE THROB.

697
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:16,711
OH, I LOVE THAT.

698
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:20,680
HA HA HA!

699
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:23,968
DOLORES, OUR MARRIAGE
LIES BROKEN ON THE FLOOR

700
00:38:24,003 --> 00:38:27,614
LIKE THE SHARDS OF GLASS
ON OUR HONEYMOON SUITE!

701
00:38:27,649 --> 00:38:31,225
AAH! OH! 19th CENTURY
INDIAN RUBBER VASE, EH?

702
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:35,730
DOLORES, I AM MAKING
A CITIZEN'S DIVORCE.

703
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:37,196
WHAT?

704
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:39,198
BY THE POWERS
VESTED IN ME,

705
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:44,238
I HEREBY DECLARE OUR
MARRIAGE NULL AND VOID!

706
00:38:44,273 --> 00:38:46,240

711
00:39:01,257 --> 00:39:02,741
MY WIFE WON'T BE COMING.

712
00:39:02,776 --> 00:39:04,225
OH. I TRUST
SHE IS NOT ILL.

00:39:04,725 --> 00:39:07,728

718
00:39:20,276 --> 00:39:21,707

720
00:39:24,745 --> 00:39:26,747

THE DOCTOR OF HER PASSING.

725
00:39:38,259 --> 00:39:39,725

00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,264
HOW BIG IS THE ESTATE?

727
00:40:00,281 --> 00:40:02,283

YOU'RE THE FIRST... OBJECT
THAT EVER PRONOUNCED IT RIGHT.

771
00:42:36,171 --> 00:42:37,638
HOW ELSE COULD YOU
PRONOUNCE IT?

772
00:42:38,138 --> 00:42:41,141
H- F-U-H-R-U-H-U-R-R,

00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:44,610

774
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:46,111
WHO ARE YOU?

775
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:50,616
ANNE. ANNE UUMELLMAHAYE

776
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:55,656
U- U-M-E-L-L-M-A-H-A-Y-E?
UUMELLMAHAYE?

777
00:42:55,691 --> 00:42:59,159

IT'S SO DARK.

778
00:42:59,194 --> 00:43:01,662
IN A DOCTOR'S LABORATORY.

779
00:43:01,697 --> 00:43:04,665
AM I ALL RIGHT?

780
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:09,134
UM... NOT REALLY.

781
00:43:09,169 --> 00:43:13,674
WILL I BE ABLE TO PLAY
THE PIANO AGAIN?

782
00:43:13,709 --> 00:43:18,143
UM, I WOULD THINK-NO.

783
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:21,181
WHY DID YOU CALL ME
AN OBJECT?

784
00:43:21,216 --> 00:43:23,684
I'M SORRY.

785
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:28,188
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE TO CALL YOU.

786
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:31,156
WHY?

787
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:32,192
YOU DON'T KNOW?

788
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:34,194

WELL...

791
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:43,704
MISS UUMELLMAHAYE, IT SEEMS
THAT YOU HAVE NO BODY.

792
00:43:44,204 --> 00:43:46,206
WHAT HAPPENED
TO MY BODY?

793
00:43:46,241 --> 00:43:47,708
IT'S DEAD. GONE.

794
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:53,213
YOU'RE A DISEMBODIED BRAIN
KEPT ALIVE BY A SCIENTIST.

795
00:43:53,248 --> 00:43:55,180
BUT WE'RE TALKING.

796
00:43:55,215 --> 00:44:00,220
I MUST AT LEAST HAVE LIPS,
A TONGUE, A THROAT.

797
00:44:00,255 --> 00:44:03,223
NOTHING.
JUST A JAR.

798
00:44:03,258 --> 00:44:06,727
OH! OH!

799
00:44:07,227 --> 00:44:10,195
DON'T CRY.

800
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:12,698
BUT HOW CAN I HEAR YOU?

801
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:14,484
MUST BE SOME KIND
OF TELEPATHY.

802
00:44:14,519 --> 00:44:16,201
WHAT'S GOING
TO HAPPEN TO ME?

803
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:20,741
HANS TOLD ME
YOU WERE HERE. GOOD, GOOD.

804
00:44:21,241 --> 00:44:24,209
NOW, LET ME SHOW YOU

805
00:44:24,244 --> 00:44:26,747
THAT EXPERIMENT
I'VE BEEN WORKING ON.

806
00:44:26,782 --> 00:44:28,749
NO! NO.

807
00:44:29,249 --> 00:44:30,751
I'VE GOT SOMETHING
MORE IMPORTANT.

808
00:44:30,786 --> 00:44:32,770
LISTEN, JUST LISTEN.

809
00:44:32,805 --> 00:44:34,755
ALL RIGHT, SING.

810
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:39,259
Anne:? IF YOU LIKE-A ME
LIKE I LIKE-A YOU?

811
00:44:39,294 --> 00:44:43,764
? AND WE LIKE-A BOTH
THE SAME?

812
00:44:43,799 --> 00:44:45,731
? I LIKE-A SAY...?

813
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:48,268
HAVE YOU HEARD ANYTHING
LIKE THAT IN YOUR LIFE?

814
00:44:48,303 --> 00:44:49,770
I CAN'T HEAR
A THING.

815
00:44:49,805 --> 00:44:51,271
OH, REALLY?

816
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:52,272
SHH.

817
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:53,273
WHAT WERE YOU DOING?

818
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:56,777
I WAS JUST WORKING
ON MY NEW TECHNIQUE

819
00:44:56,812 --> 00:44:58,744
FOR WALKING IN CORDUROY PANTS

820
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:02,282
TO ELIMINATE THE SCRAPING
WHEN YOUR THIGHS RUB TOGETHER.

821
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:05,751
THAT'S VERY
EXCITING WORK, DOCTOR.

822
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:08,288
NOW, COME ON. LET ME
SHOW YOU WHAT I'VE DONE

823
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:10,290
FOR YOUR FRIEND
BECKERMAN.

824
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:15,295
WHUP.
JUST ONE MOMENT.

825
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:18,764
WHAT HAPPENED?

826
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:21,301
NO ONE CAN HEAR YOU
BUT ME.

827
00:45:21,336 --> 00:45:23,804
Necessiter:
DOCTOR!

828
00:45:24,304 --> 00:45:24,805
DID YOU HEAR THAT?

829
00:45:25,305 --> 00:45:25,806
NO.

830
00:45:26,306 --> 00:45:28,808
YOU CAN'T HEAR
ANYONE BUT ME.

831
00:45:28,843 --> 00:45:31,311
IT IS SOME KIND
OF TELEPATHY.

832
00:45:31,346 --> 00:45:32,778
I'M FRIGHTENED.

833
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:35,315
DON'T BE. THINGS ARE NEVER
AS BAD AS THEY SEEM.

834
00:45:35,350 --> 00:45:38,318
YOU STILL HAVE YOUR BRAIN.

835
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:40,821
DR. HFUHRUHURR!

836
00:45:40,856 --> 00:45:42,840
I'LL BE BACK.

837
00:45:42,875 --> 00:45:44,825
JUST STAY HERE.

838
00:45:47,327 --> 00:45:50,330
I BELIEVE YOU KNOW
THIS GENTLEMAN.

839
00:45:50,365 --> 00:45:53,298
IS THAT
DR. BECKERMAN?

840
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:56,336
SORT OF. SEE,
I'VE DEVISED A MACHINE

841
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:59,840
THAT CAN TRANSFER THE
ENTIRE CONTENTS OF ONE BRAIN

842
00:45:59,875 --> 00:46:01,306
INTO ANOTHER BRAIN.
UNDERSTAND, OF COURSE,

843
00:46:01,341 --> 00:46:03,844
THAT THE BRAIN OF A GORILLA
IS SMALLER THAN A HUMAN'S,

844
00:46:03,879 --> 00:46:06,346
SO MUCH OF DR. BECKERMAN'S
VAST KNOWLEDGE

845
00:46:06,381 --> 00:46:08,348
COULDN'T BE ACCOMMODATED.

846
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:09,349
DR. BECKERMAN?

847
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:15,355
THAT'S HIM ALL RIGHT.

848
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:18,358
WE NEVER DID LIKE TO
SHAKE HANDS WITH HIM.

849
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:20,861
HE MUST BE LONELY.

850
00:46:21,361 --> 00:46:24,364
PERHAPS SOON WE'LL
FIND HIM A COMPANION.

851
00:46:24,399 --> 00:46:25,866
COME, DOCTOR.

852
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:32,873
BYE.

853
00:46:39,012 --> 00:46:39,978
I'M GOING UP
TO PACK MY CLOTHES.

854
00:46:40,013 --> 00:46:41,515
CAN YOU SEND THE BELLMAN
UP IN 10 MINUTES?

855
00:46:41,550 --> 00:46:42,516
YES, SIR.

856
00:47:13,547 --> 00:47:14,548
"MY DARLING HUSBAND,

857
00:47:15,048 --> 00:47:18,051
"BY THE TIME YOU READ THIS
I WILL BE DEAD.

858
00:47:18,086 --> 00:47:21,054
"MY ONLY REGRET
IS THAT I CAUSED YOU PAIN.

859
00:47:21,089 --> 00:47:22,055
"I HOPE

860
00:47:22,556 --> 00:47:24,057

861
00:47:24,558 --> 00:47:27,060
"MAY I BURN IN HELL FOR

862
00:47:27,095 --> 00:47:28,562

866
00:47:34,754 --> 00:47:36,570
AAH!

867
00:47:36,605 --> 00:47:37,571
NO!

868
00:47:43,076 --> 00:47:44,077
YOU'RE ALIVE!

869
00:47:44,112 --> 00:47:45,078
YES.

870
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:47,581
BUT THE SCREAM...

871
00:47:47,616 --> 00:47:48,582
I WAS REHEARSING.

872
00:47:49,583 --> 00:47:51,550
DON'T COME NEAR ME.

873
00:47:51,585 --> 00:47:52,586
WHY ARE YOU
DOING THIS?

874
00:47:52,621 --> 00:47:54,553
BECAUSE I'M EVIL.

875
00:47:54,588 --> 00:47:56,089
YOU'RE NOT EVIL.
YOU'RE SICK.

876
00:47:57,090 --> 00:47:58,056
SICK?

877
00:47:58,091 --> 00:47:59,558
YES, FROM THE OPERATION.

878
00:47:59,593 --> 00:48:01,595
JUST SCREW YOUR HEAD ON
A LITTLE BIT TIGHTER.

879
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:03,061
YOU CAN BE WELL.

880
00:48:03,096 --> 00:48:04,848
IT'S NO USE, MICHAEL.

881
00:48:04,883 --> 00:48:06,600
I'M NO GOOD FOR YOU.

882
00:48:06,635 --> 00:48:08,101
AND, BESIDES,

883
00:48:08,602 --> 00:48:09,568
YOU DIVORCED ME.

884
00:48:09,603 --> 00:48:12,105
I'M MAKING
A CITIZEN'S ANNULMENT.

885
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:14,608
IPSO FACTO,
COITUS INTERRUPTUS.

886
00:48:16,109 --> 00:48:17,610
I'M COMING TO GET YOU.

887
00:48:17,645 --> 00:48:19,077
NO! STAY WHERE YOU ARE.

888
00:48:19,112 --> 00:48:22,115
I CAN'T STAND HURTING YOU
ANYMORE, MICHAEL.

889
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:23,617
GOOD-BYE, MY DARLING.

890
00:48:23,652 --> 00:48:24,618
NO!

891
00:48:56,650 --> 00:48:58,652
TAKE MY HAND.

892
00:49:02,656 --> 00:49:04,157
YOU'RE SAFE
WITH ME NOW. AAH!

893
00:49:05,659 --> 00:49:08,161
PUT YOUR ARMS
AROUND MY NECK.

894
00:49:13,166 --> 00:49:17,671
I HOPE THIS IS STRONG ENOUGH
FOR THE BOTH OF US.

895
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:23,927
HANG ON.

896
00:49:23,962 --> 00:49:25,644
UHH!

897
00:49:30,183 --> 00:49:31,184
UHH!

898
00:49:32,185 --> 00:49:33,186
I DON'T HAVE
ANY MORE SALIVA.

899
00:49:33,687 --> 00:49:35,188
I NEED YOURS.

900
00:49:39,192 --> 00:49:41,159
UHH!

901
00:49:41,194 --> 00:49:43,196
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT NOW.

902
00:49:43,231 --> 00:49:44,698
OH!
THERE.

903
00:49:48,702 --> 00:49:50,203
YOU'RE GOING
TO THE HOSPITAL.

904
00:49:50,238 --> 00:49:52,205
NO, MICHAEL, PLEASE.

905
00:49:52,706 --> 00:49:56,209
I WANT TO MAKE IT UP
TO YOU.

906
00:49:58,712 --> 00:49:59,713
WHEN? THURSDAY?

907
00:50:00,213 --> 00:50:01,715
HOW ABOUT MONDAY?

908
00:50:02,716 --> 00:50:03,717
NEXT MONDAY?

909
00:50:03,752 --> 00:50:04,735
TODAY, MONDAY.

910
00:50:04,770 --> 00:50:05,719
LATER TODAY?

911
00:50:05,754 --> 00:50:06,685

912
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,221

HAIRLESS CHEST.

00:50:41,790 --> 00:50:42,756
HAIRY.

919

I NEVER KNEW
IT COULD BE LIKE THAT.

920
00:50:58,772 --> 00:51:00,273
OH, IT WAS SO...

921
00:51:01,775 --> 00:51:02,776

WE ARE FINALLY UNITED UNDER
THE HOLY LAWS OF MATRIMONY-

00:51:14,788 --> 00:51:16,539

IS DR. NECESSITER IN?

935
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:15,847
NO, SIR.

936
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:17,384
MAY I WAIT FOR HIM?

937
00:52:17,419 --> 00:52:18,385
YES.

938
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:30,397
I MEANT,
MAY I WAIT INSIDE?

939
00:52:30,432 --> 00:52:31,398

MAY I WAIT
IN THE LABORATORY?

941
00:52:37,188 --> 00:52:38,905
OH, I'M AFRAID
IT'S LOCKED, SIR,

942
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:42,909
BUT YOU ARE WELCOME
TO WAIT IN THE DEN.

943
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:50,667
MAKE YOURSELF
COMFORTABLE, SIR.

944
00:52:50,702 --> 00:52:52,919
PERHAPS I COULD
BRING YOU A DRINK?

945
00:52:52,954 --> 00:52:55,922
YES. UH,

946
00:52:55,957 --> 00:52:57,389

00:52:57,424 --> 00:52:58,425

948
00:52:58,460 --> 00:52:59,926
AH.

00:53:06,468 --> 00:53:07,434
DAMN.

950
00:53:17,944 --> 00:53:20,447

00:53:22,734 --> 00:53:24,416
I'M FINE.

953
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:25,917
I JUST LEANED
AGAINST THE DOOR.

954
00:53:25,952 --> 00:53:28,955
THE DOORS IN THIS CONDO
ARE PAPER-THIN.

955
00:53:30,957 --> 00:53:32,959
EVERYTHING TODAY
IS MADE SO CHEAP.

956
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:35,462
HERE, LOOK AT THIS WALL-

957
00:53:36,963 --> 00:53:38,430

958
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:40,967
HERE IS YOUR DRINK, SIR.

959
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:42,434
THANK YOU.

960
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:44,471
NOW CAN I GET YOU
ANYTHING ELSE, DOCTOR?

961
00:53:44,506 --> 00:53:46,438
I AM ABOUT TO RETIRE.

962
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:47,974
REALLY?
YOU SEEM SO YOUNG.

963
00:53:49,976 --> 00:53:52,478
NO. I MEAN RETIRE
FOR THE NIGHT.

964
00:53:52,513 --> 00:53:54,998
OH. OH, NO, THANKS,
I'M FINE.

965
00:53:55,033 --> 00:53:57,449
AND DON'T WORRY
ABOUT THIS.

966
00:53:57,484 --> 00:54:00,487
I'LL HAVE IT REPLACED
IN THE MORNING.

967
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:04,991
MISS UUMELLMAHAYE?

968
00:54:08,995 --> 00:54:10,497
MISS UUMELLMAHAYE?

969
00:54:10,997 --> 00:54:11,998
DR. HFUHRUHURR?

970
00:54:12,033 --> 00:54:13,767
MISS UUMELLMAHAYE?

971
00:54:13,802 --> 00:54:15,502
DR. HFUHRUHURR?

972
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:20,507
DR. HFUHRUHURR.

973
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:24,010
NO.

974
00:54:25,011 --> 00:54:26,012
NO.

975
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:30,482
DR. HFUHRUHURR,

976
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:33,019
WHAT'S HAPPENED TO ME?

977
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:37,489
YOU'RE A GORILLA.

978
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:40,026
I DON'T FEEL
LIKE A GORILLA.

979
00:54:40,061 --> 00:54:42,529
WELL, YOU SURE DO
LOOK LIKE ONE.

980
00:54:42,564 --> 00:54:43,995
BUT I-I CAN'T BE.

981
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:47,033
I CAN'T SEE OR TOUCH...

982
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:49,501
OR ANYTHING.

983
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:51,538
MISS UUMELLMAHAYE?

984
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:56,543
CALL ME ANNE.

985
00:54:57,544 --> 00:54:59,010
THANK GOD.

986
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:00,547
YOU'RE STILL A BRAIN.

987
00:55:00,582 --> 00:55:01,815
OOPS!

988
00:55:01,850 --> 00:55:03,014
HEY!

989
00:55:03,049 --> 00:55:05,301
WHY DID YOU THINK
I WAS A GORILLA?

990
00:55:05,336 --> 00:55:07,554
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT
DR. NECESSITER

991
00:55:07,589 --> 00:55:09,055
HAS PLANNED FOR YOU.

992
00:55:10,056 --> 00:55:11,557
BUT DON'T WORRY.

993
00:55:11,592 --> 00:55:13,059
I HAVE OTHER PLANS.

994
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:50,263
YOU'RE IN MY ROOM NOW.

995
00:55:50,298 --> 00:55:51,765
Anne:
WHERE IN YOUR ROOM?

996
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:53,266
IN A-

997
00:55:55,268 --> 00:55:57,270
ON A GOLD LEAF
FLORENTINE TABLE

998
00:55:57,305 --> 00:55:59,237
BY THE WINDOW,

999
00:55:59,272 --> 00:56:01,239
OVERLOOKING A GARDEN.

1000
00:56:01,274 --> 00:56:04,778
OH, I CAN ALMOST
SMELL THE FLOWERS.

1001
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:07,280
PHEW.

1002
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:10,784
SLEEP WELL, ANNE.

1003
00:56:11,284 --> 00:56:13,787
GOOD NIGHT, MICHAEL.

1004
00:56:15,789 --> 00:56:17,290
GOOD NIGHT.

1005
00:56:22,295 --> 00:56:23,762
MMM.
YOU GETTING UP?

1006
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:25,298
YEAH, YEAH,
JUST GETTING UP.

1007
00:56:25,333 --> 00:56:26,800
AHH.

1008
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:28,266
I'LL ORDER US
SOME BREAKFAST.

1009
00:56:28,301 --> 00:56:31,304
YEAH. ORDER ME 2 SHEETS
OF BACON AND A PILLOW.

1010
00:56:31,339 --> 00:56:32,305
HMM?

1011
00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:37,275
HEY, KNOW WHAT
I'VE BEEN THINKING?

1012
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:39,813
THERE'S NO NEED
TO RUSH HOME RIGHT NOW.

1013
00:56:39,848 --> 00:56:40,814
I'M DUE FOR A SABBATICAL,

1014
00:56:41,314 --> 00:56:42,315
AND THERE'S A LOT
OF EXPERIMENTATION

1015
00:56:42,350 --> 00:56:43,281
GOING ON IN THIS CITY-

1016
00:56:43,316 --> 00:56:45,318
A LOT OF SCIENTISTS,
A LOT OF BRAIN RESEARCH.

1017
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:46,820
YOU KNOW, I COULD GO OUT
AND LOOK FOR A COTTAGE,

1018
00:56:46,855 --> 00:56:48,339
AND I COULD SET UP
A LITTLE LABORATORY.

1019
00:56:48,374 --> 00:56:49,849
WE COULD BE VERY, VERY
COMFORTABLE THERE.

1020
00:56:49,884 --> 00:56:51,289
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF AN IDEA LIKE THAT?

1021
00:56:51,324 --> 00:56:53,827
YOU THINK I SHOULD GO OUT
AND LOOK FOR ONE RIGHT NOW?

1022
00:56:53,862 --> 00:56:55,293
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

1023
00:56:55,328 --> 00:56:57,796
DO YOU WANT ME
TO GO WITH YOU?

1024
00:56:57,831 --> 00:56:58,832
NO, NO, THAT'S NOT
NECESSARY, REALLY.

1025
00:56:58,867 --> 00:56:59,798
OH, BUT I'D LOVE TO.

1026
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:00,799
OH, IT'S SO MUCH TROUBLE,

1027
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:01,835
THE DRIVING

1028
00:57:01,870 --> 00:57:03,336
AND THE REALTORS.

1029
00:57:03,371 --> 00:57:04,302
YES?

1030
00:57:04,337 --> 00:57:05,338
MAY I TAKE THE TABLE?

1031
00:57:05,373 --> 00:57:06,339
OH, YEAH, COME ON IN.

1032
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:07,841
IT'S REALLY...

1033
00:57:07,876 --> 00:57:09,109
AHEM.

1034
00:57:09,144 --> 00:57:10,308
MADAME.

1035
00:57:10,343 --> 00:57:11,344
OH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

1036
00:57:12,345 --> 00:57:14,347
IT ISN'T NECESSARY
FOR ME TO GO.

1037
00:57:14,382 --> 00:57:15,348
I'D JUST BE IN THE WAY.

1038
00:57:15,383 --> 00:57:16,815
IT'S BEST.

1039
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:19,352
I THINK I'LL JUST

1040
00:57:19,387 --> 00:57:20,819
SLIP...

1041
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:23,356
OUT OF THESE CLOTHES

1042
00:57:23,391 --> 00:57:25,125
INTO A HOT BATH.

1043
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:26,860
THAT'S GREAT.

1044
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:27,861
THAT'S GREAT.

1045
00:57:28,361 --> 00:57:29,362
YEP.

1046
00:57:38,872 --> 00:57:41,374
AHEM.
YOU MUST BE DR. HFUHRUHURR.

1047
00:57:41,409 --> 00:57:43,341
HFUHRUHURR, YES.

1048
00:57:43,376 --> 00:57:44,377
CAN I GIVE YOU
A HAND, SIR?

1049
00:57:44,878 --> 00:57:45,378
NO, I'M FINE.

1050
00:57:45,879 --> 00:57:47,380
WHAT DO YOU HAVE THERE?

1051
00:57:47,881 --> 00:57:50,383
YOU HAVE A CUTE LITTLE
KITTY CAT IN THERE?

1052
00:57:50,418 --> 00:57:51,850
HELLO,KATZE.

1053
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:53,386
PEEKABOO.
I SEE YOU.

1054
00:57:53,421 --> 00:57:54,853
AH, THAT'S CUTE-

1055
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:56,389
ALL CURLED UP
IN THE LITTLE BALL.

1056
00:57:57,891 --> 00:57:59,392
OH, YOU HAVE
NO HAIR. OHH!

1057
00:57:59,427 --> 00:58:00,859
SORRY. UM...

1058
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:02,896
I'D LIKE TO SEE THE HOUSE.

1059
00:58:02,931 --> 00:58:04,397
SURE.

1060
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:09,402
GUESS WHAT?

1061
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:10,403
I FOUND US A COTTAGE,

1062
00:58:10,904 --> 00:58:11,905
AND I THINK WE OUGHT
TO GO THERE RIGHT AWAY.

1063
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:12,906
WELL, WHAT'S THE RUSH?

1064
00:58:13,406 --> 00:58:13,907
WELL, I SET UP
AN EXPERIMENT,

1065
00:58:14,407 --> 00:58:15,408
AND I TOLD IT
I'D BE RIGHT BACK.

1066
00:58:15,443 --> 00:58:16,910
OH, YOU'RE DRESSED.
GOOD.

1067
00:58:22,415 --> 00:58:23,416
I'LL GO GET THE CAR.

1068
00:58:23,451 --> 00:58:24,417
LET'S GO!

1069
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:28,922
WHY ARE YOU
DRIVING SO FAST?

1070
00:58:29,422 --> 00:58:31,674
I JUST WANT TO SHOW YOU
OUR NEW HOME.

1071
00:58:31,709 --> 00:58:33,927
WHAT IS THIS EXPERIMENT
YOU'RE DOING?

1072
00:58:34,427 --> 00:58:35,894
JUST SOME BORING
BRAIN STUFF.

1073
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:37,430
OH, YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO HAVE MICE AND RATS

1074
00:58:37,465 --> 00:58:38,396
IN THE HOUSE, ARE YOU?

1075
00:58:38,431 --> 00:58:40,433
NO, NO.
JUST SOME MICROSCOPES

1076
00:58:40,468 --> 00:58:42,435
AND TEST TUBES
AND BEAKERS

1077
00:58:42,470 --> 00:58:44,437
AND MAYBE A BRAIN.

1078
00:58:44,472 --> 00:58:45,904
A BRAIN?

1079
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:46,940
JUST A SMALL 4-POUNDER.
YOU'LL NEVER SEE IT.

1080
00:58:46,975 --> 00:58:47,941
I'LL KEEP IT LOCKED UP.

1081
00:58:51,945 --> 00:58:53,947
RUTH WAS
THE GREATEST BASEBALL PLAYER

1082
00:58:53,982 --> 00:58:55,949
OF ALL TIME.

1083
00:58:56,449 --> 00:58:58,952
YOU NEVER SAW RUTH PLAY.

1084
00:58:58,987 --> 00:59:00,418
ON FILM, I DID.

1085
00:59:00,453 --> 00:59:02,455
MICHAEL, ARE YOU
ON THE PHONE?

1086
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:03,957
UH, YES.

1087
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:07,961
WELL, I'M WAITING FOR YOU...

1088
00:59:07,996 --> 00:59:09,427
IN BED.

1089
00:59:09,462 --> 00:59:11,964
WE'LL FINISH THIS TOMORROW.

1090
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:14,467
MICHAEL,
IT WAS FUN TONIGHT.

1091
00:59:14,502 --> 00:59:16,469
IT WAS FUN FOR ME, TOO.

1092
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:41,494
DON'T YOU WANT
TO MAKE LOVE?

1093
00:59:41,995 --> 00:59:43,496
OH, YEAH, YEAH.

1094
00:59:43,531 --> 00:59:44,765
THAT'D BE GREAT.

1095
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:45,964
I'LL TAKE THIS OFF.

1096
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:50,003
NO, NO, NO. I CAN-
I CAN WORK AROUND IT.

1097
00:59:53,006 --> 00:59:55,008
OH, THAT FEELS SO...

1098
00:59:58,011 --> 00:59:59,012
OVER.

1099
01:00:00,513 --> 01:00:03,516
IT JUST KEEPS GETTING
BETTER AND BETTER.

1100
01:00:08,556 --> 01:00:09,487
WHAT?

1101
01:00:09,522 --> 01:00:10,523
ARE YOU GOING TO BE
IN THERE FOREVER?

1102
01:00:11,024 --> 01:00:13,276
UH-HUH.
I MEAN, UH, NO, NO.

1103
01:00:13,311 --> 01:00:15,528
JUST ANOTHER
COUPLE OF DAYS.

1104
01:00:15,563 --> 01:00:17,495
OH.

1105
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:19,031
WELL, I GUESS
I'LL JUST GO TO TOWN

1106
01:00:19,066 --> 01:00:20,533
AND TRY AND FIND
SOMETHING TO DO.

1107
01:00:20,568 --> 01:00:22,052
OH, DON'T GO.

1108
01:00:22,087 --> 01:00:23,536
BYE, DARLING.

1109
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:29,042
I CAN SPEND
THE WHOLE DAY WITH YOU.

1110
01:00:29,077 --> 01:00:30,508
ARE YOU BUSY?

1111
01:00:30,543 --> 01:00:32,545
YES, BUT I'LL
CANCEL MY APPOINTMENTS.

1112
01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:36,014
THE WHOLE DAY.

1113
01:00:36,049 --> 01:00:37,300
I DON'T THINK
THERE'S A GIRL

1114
01:00:37,335 --> 01:00:38,551
FLOATING IN ANY JAR
ANYWHERE

1115
01:00:38,586 --> 01:00:41,554
WHO'S AS HAPPY AS I AM.

1116
01:00:43,556 --> 01:00:45,558
OH, MICHAEL,
YOU DO SO MUCH FOR ME,

1117
01:00:46,059 --> 01:00:47,560
AND I DO NOTHING
FOR YOU.

1118
01:00:47,595 --> 01:00:49,062
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR HEAD?

1119
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:52,065
I'M SORRY.
I FORGOT.

1120
01:00:52,565 --> 01:00:53,531
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,

1121
01:00:53,566 --> 01:00:55,068
YOU'RE THE MOST COMPLETE
WOMAN I'VE EVER KNOWN.

1122
01:00:55,568 --> 01:00:57,570
ALL MY LIFE, I WANTED WOMEN
WITH GREAT BODIES-

1123
01:00:57,605 --> 01:01:00,073
WOMEN WHO WERE 10s.

1124
01:01:00,108 --> 01:01:02,040
AND NOW...

1125
01:01:02,075 --> 01:01:03,576
FOR THE FIRST TIME,

1126
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:06,579
I'M AROUSED BY A MIND.

1127
01:01:06,614 --> 01:01:08,046
MICHAEL,

1128
01:01:08,081 --> 01:01:09,547
I WISH I COULD KISS YOU.

1129
01:01:09,582 --> 01:01:11,084
I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT THAT.

1130
01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:12,550
REALLY?

1131
01:01:12,585 --> 01:01:13,586
YES, REALLY.

1132
01:01:15,088 --> 01:01:16,089
I, UH...

1133
01:01:17,590 --> 01:01:21,094
I BOUGHT YOU
A PAIR OF WAX LIPS.

1134
01:01:25,098 --> 01:01:26,599
I WAS GOING TO STICK THEM
ON YOUR JAR.

1135
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:28,101
IS THAT CRAZY?

1136
01:01:28,136 --> 01:01:29,369
OH, NO.

1137
01:01:29,404 --> 01:01:30,603
PLEASE.

1138
01:01:36,109 --> 01:01:37,610
HOW DO I LOOK?

1139
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:55,093
MICHAEL?
YES?

1140
01:01:55,128 --> 01:01:57,130
WERE YOU OUT
ON THE LAKE TODAY

1141
01:01:57,165 --> 01:01:58,631
KISSING YOUR BRAIN?

1142
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:02,100
NO.

1143
01:02:02,135 --> 01:02:03,136
YOU DIDN'T TAKE
THE ROWBOAT OUT?

1144
01:02:03,171 --> 01:02:04,602
FUNNY.

1145
01:02:04,637 --> 01:02:06,604
THERE WAS A MAN
OUT THERE,

1146
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:09,142
LOOKED JUST LIKE YOU,
KISSING A BRAIN.

1147
01:02:09,177 --> 01:02:10,143
MUST'VE BEEN
SOMEBODY ELSE.

1148
01:02:10,178 --> 01:02:11,109
SOMEBODY ELSE?

1149
01:02:11,144 --> 01:02:12,610
HOW MANY MEN ARE THERE
AROUND HERE,

1150
01:02:12,645 --> 01:02:15,148
DO YOU SUPPOSE, WHO LOOK
EXACTLY LIKE YOU

1151
01:02:15,183 --> 01:02:16,649
AND HAVE BRAINS IN JARS?

1152
01:02:16,684 --> 01:02:18,151
OH...

1153
01:02:18,651 --> 01:02:20,653
WELL, AROUND HERE,
MUST BE HUNDREDS.

1154
01:02:20,688 --> 01:02:22,155
OH, STOP IT, MICHAEL.

1155
01:02:22,655 --> 01:02:23,656
I KNOW THERE'S SOMETHING
WEIRD GOING ON

1156
01:02:23,691 --> 01:02:25,158
WITH YOU AND THAT BRAIN.

1157
01:02:25,193 --> 01:02:26,176
IT'S NOT WEIRD.

1158
01:02:26,211 --> 01:02:27,160
IT'S MY WORK.

1159
01:02:27,195 --> 01:02:28,161
OH.

1160
01:02:28,661 --> 01:02:31,664
IT'S YOUR WORK TO KISS
A DEAD BRAIN?

1161
01:02:31,699 --> 01:02:33,666
SHE'S NOT DEAD.
SHE'S ALIVE.

1162
01:02:33,701 --> 01:02:35,133
SO, NOW IT'S A SHE!

1163
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:37,670
YOU CARE MORE ABOUT
THAT BRAIN THAN YOU DO ME.

1164
01:02:37,705 --> 01:02:39,689
MICHAEL, I AM YOUR COOK,

1165
01:02:39,724 --> 01:02:41,639
YOUR MAID, YOUR LOVER.

1166
01:02:41,674 --> 01:02:43,141
I'M UNDERSTANDING
ABOUT YOUR WORK.

1167
01:02:43,176 --> 01:02:45,178
I ALMOST THREW MYSELF OUT
A WINDOW BECAUSE OF YOU.

1168
01:02:45,213 --> 01:02:47,145
AND YOU,

1169
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:49,682
YOU TREAT ME
LIKE A DOORMAT.

1170
01:02:49,717 --> 01:02:50,648
DOLORES,

1171
01:02:50,683 --> 01:02:52,685
I'M SORRY.
I- I JUST...

1172
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:58,191
I DIDN'T REALIZE
WHAT I WAS DOING TO YOU.

1173
01:02:58,691 --> 01:03:00,192
HELLO?

1174
01:03:00,227 --> 01:03:01,659

GRANDMA NOONEY DIED?

1179
01:03:18,211 --> 01:03:19,712
NO, SHE DIDN'T TELL ME.

1180
01:03:22,215 --> 01:03:23,716
HOW MUCH?

1181
01:03:23,751 --> 01:03:25,218

FIRST THING MONDAY.

1183
01:03:33,726 --> 01:03:35,227
THE DAY YOU LEARNED
ABOUT MY INHERITANCE

1184
01:03:35,262 --> 01:03:36,729
IS THE DAY YOU STARTED
TO BE NICE TO ME.

1185
01:03:36,764 --> 01:03:38,196
WHAT A COINCIDENCE.

1186
01:03:38,231 --> 01:03:40,698
YOU ONLY STAYED AROUND
FOR THE MONEY.

1187
01:03:40,733 --> 01:03:43,736
WHAT OTHER REASON
COULD THERE POSSIBLY BE?

1188
01:03:43,771 --> 01:03:45,203
GOD!

1189
01:03:45,238 --> 01:03:47,240

WHERE'S MY BRAIN?

1198
01:04:30,117 --> 01:04:31,083
HOW SHOULD I KNOW?

1199
01:04:31,118 --> 01:04:32,550
I'M BUSY.

1202
01:04:38,125 --> 01:04:40,057
I KNOW WHAT THAT IS.

1203
01:04:40,092 --> 01:04:42,094
I HAD THAT ONCE WHEN I WAS
IN THE ARMY IN FRANCE.

1204
01:04:42,129 --> 01:04:43,561
IT WAS A SMALL CAF?.

1205
01:04:43,596 --> 01:04:45,598
I WAS YOUNG. I WAS IMPETUOUS.
I'D EAT ANYTHING.

1213
01:05:01,649 --> 01:05:03,383
COUNT TO 10.

1214
01:05:03,418 --> 01:05:05,018

OUT OF MY LIFE!

1223

SCUM QUEEN!

1237
01:05:47,194 --> 01:05:48,160
AAH!

1238
01:05:50,162 --> 01:05:52,164
YOU'LL NEVER GET
A PENNY OF THAT INHERITANCE.

1239
01:05:52,199 --> 01:05:53,165
FIRST THING MONDAY,
I'M DONATING IT

1240
01:05:53,666 --> 01:05:55,668
TO CRANIAL RESEARCH
FOR THE POOR.

1241
01:05:56,704 --> 01:05:59,136
BY MONDAY,

1242
01:05:59,171 --> 01:06:00,639
YOU'LL BE DEAD!

1243
01:06:02,143 --> 01:06:04,877
ANNE.

1244
01:06:06,379 --> 01:06:10,383
MICHAEL, WHO DID YOU
CALL A SCUM QUEEN?

1245
01:06:10,418 --> 01:06:11,349
OH...

1246
01:06:11,384 --> 01:06:13,386
JUST SOME SCUM QUEEN.

1247
01:06:14,387 --> 01:06:16,389
I'M FRIGHTENED, MICHAEL.

1248
01:06:16,424 --> 01:06:18,391
I FEEL SO STRANGE.

1249
01:06:18,891 --> 01:06:20,893
I FEEL THE WORLD
SLIPPING AWAY.

1250
01:06:21,394 --> 01:06:23,896
IF ONLY WE COULD BE
TOGETHER-

1251
01:06:23,931 --> 01:06:25,398
REALLYTOGETHER.

1252
01:06:26,899 --> 01:06:28,401
WE CAN, DARLING.

1253
01:06:29,402 --> 01:06:30,653
OH, WE CAN.

1254
01:06:30,688 --> 01:06:31,904
DR. NECESSITER,

1255
01:06:32,405 --> 01:06:33,906
I WANT TO BECOME
A BRAIN.

1256
01:06:33,941 --> 01:06:35,373
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

1257
01:06:35,408 --> 01:06:36,909
I WANT YOU TO BUILD
A TANK FOR 2.

1258
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:39,412
I WANT YOU TO PUT ME IN
WITH ANNE UUMELLMAHAYE.

1259
01:06:39,447 --> 01:06:40,913
ANNE UUMELLMA-WHO?

1260
01:06:40,948 --> 01:06:42,432
UUMELLMAHAYE.

1261
01:06:42,467 --> 01:06:43,881
BRAIN 21, TO YOU.

1262
01:06:43,916 --> 01:06:46,419
SO, YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO STOLE BRAIN 21.

1263
01:06:46,454 --> 01:06:47,385
WHERE IS IT?

1264
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:49,887
IN THE TRUNK OF MY CAR.

1265
01:06:49,922 --> 01:06:53,426
I TOLD HER IT WAS A BOX SEAT
AT THE VIENNA OPERA.

1266
01:06:53,461 --> 01:06:55,893
HERE ARE MY INSTRUMENTS.

1267
01:06:55,928 --> 01:06:57,930
DO I UNDERSTAND YOU
CORRECTLY?

1268
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:00,433
YOU WANT ME TO REMOVE
YOUR BRAIN

1269
01:07:00,933 --> 01:07:02,435
AND PUT IT IN A TANK
WITH NUMBER 21?

1270
01:07:02,935 --> 01:07:04,937
YES! WE CAN
COMMUNICATE.

1271
01:07:04,972 --> 01:07:05,903
WE'RE IN LOVE.

1272
01:07:05,938 --> 01:07:07,440
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY
WE CAN BE TOGETHER.

1273
01:07:07,475 --> 01:07:09,907
PUT ME IN A TANK.

1274
01:07:09,942 --> 01:07:12,445
THERE IS AN ALTERNATIVE.

1275
01:07:12,945 --> 01:07:16,198
AS YOU KNOW, MY RESEARCH
HAS ADVANCED TO A POINT

1276
01:07:16,233 --> 01:07:19,452
WHERE I CAN PUT HER MIND
INTO THE BODY OF A GORILLA.

1277
01:07:19,487 --> 01:07:20,953
I COULDN'T FUCK
A GORILLA.

1278
01:07:21,454 --> 01:07:21,954
YES, I KNOW,

1279
01:07:22,455 --> 01:07:24,957
BUT THERE IS ONE OTHER
ALTERNATIVE-

1280
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:26,424
A HUMAN SUBJECT.

1281
01:07:26,459 --> 01:07:27,960
ARE YOU SAYING YOU CAN
PLACE HER THOUGHTS

1282
01:07:27,995 --> 01:07:28,926
IN ANOTHER WOMAN'S BODY?

1283
01:07:28,961 --> 01:07:31,964
IN THE PAST WEEK, I'VE HAD
2 NEAR SUCCESSES.

1284
01:07:31,999 --> 01:07:32,965
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
NEARSUCCESSES?

1285
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,432
IN MY RECOVERY ROOM

1286
01:07:34,467 --> 01:07:37,470
ARE 2 SUBJECTS
WHO DO NOTHING BUT THIS...

1287
01:07:39,472 --> 01:07:41,223
BUT I THINK I'VE SOLVED
THE PROBLEM!

1288
01:07:41,258 --> 01:07:42,975
WHAT KIND OF LIFE
WOULD THAT BE?

1289
01:07:43,010 --> 01:07:43,976
THIS IS MY WIFE.

1290
01:07:45,478 --> 01:07:47,480
OH, I KNOW HER.
SHE'D HATE THAT.

1291
01:07:47,515 --> 01:07:49,447
I'D RATHER KEEP HER
IN A JAR.

1292
01:07:49,482 --> 01:07:50,983
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE HER
THERE FOR LONG.

1293
01:07:51,018 --> 01:07:52,485
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

1294
01:07:52,985 --> 01:07:54,737
IT'S A MIRACLE
SHE'S STILL ALIVE.

1295
01:07:54,772 --> 01:07:56,454
SHE'S OUTLIVED
EVERY BRAIN I'VE HAD.

1296
01:07:56,489 --> 01:07:59,992
YOU'LL BE LUCKY
IF SHE SURVIVES THE WEEKEND.

1297
01:08:00,027 --> 01:08:01,494
ALL RIGHT.

1298
01:08:01,994 --> 01:08:02,495
WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO?

1299
01:08:02,995 --> 01:08:04,462
WAIT.

1300
01:08:04,497 --> 01:08:05,498
WAIT FOR WHAT?

1301
01:08:05,998 --> 01:08:08,000
FOR THE ELEVATOR KILLER
TO STRIKE AGAIN.

1302
01:08:08,035 --> 01:08:10,503
ANNE COULD BE DEAD
BY THEN.

1303
01:08:12,004 --> 01:08:13,005
I'LL CHECK THE HOSPITAL,

1304
01:08:13,506 --> 01:08:14,472
THE MORGUE-

1305
01:08:14,507 --> 01:08:16,509
EVERYWHERE DEAD BODIES
HANG OUT.

1306
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:18,476
I'LL GET HER A BODY.

1307
01:08:18,511 --> 01:08:19,977
I'LL PREPARE
THE LABORATORY,

1308
01:08:20,012 --> 01:08:21,764
AND IN CASE
YOU'RE NOT SUCCESSFUL,

1309
01:08:21,799 --> 01:08:23,516
I'LL HAVE THE GORILLA
WIRED AND READY.

1310
01:08:23,551 --> 01:08:24,483
I'LL GET
A BODY!

1311
01:08:24,750 --> 01:08:26,235
WILL THIS DO?

1312
01:08:30,739 --> 01:08:31,705
SHE JUST-

1313
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:33,742
SHE JUST DOESN'T
HAVE ANY...

1314
01:08:34,243 --> 01:08:35,244
VA-VOOM.

1315
01:08:36,745 --> 01:08:38,747
SHE IS DEAD, YOU KNOW.

1316
01:08:38,782 --> 01:08:40,249
STILL...

1317
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:43,717
YOU DON'T LIKE
ANYTHING HERE?

1318
01:08:43,752 --> 01:08:46,755
NO. NOTHING REALLY
LEAPS OUT AT ME.

1319
01:08:50,759 --> 01:08:52,261
OOH.

1320
01:08:54,763 --> 01:08:56,230
ACTION'S STIFF.

1321
01:08:56,265 --> 01:08:58,517
I CAN FILE DOWN
THAT SEAR PIN.

1322
01:08:58,552 --> 01:09:00,769
LET ME HAVE A BOX
OF DUMDUMS.

1323
01:09:00,804 --> 01:09:02,271
THEY'RE ILLEGAL, MADAM.

1324
01:09:03,272 --> 01:09:06,275
SO IS KILLING
YOUR HUSBAND.

1325
01:09:17,786 --> 01:09:19,788
OH,
IF SHE WERE ONLY DEAD.

1326
01:09:21,290 --> 01:09:21,790
AAH!

1327
01:09:22,291 --> 01:09:23,757
YEAH!

1328
01:09:27,796 --> 01:09:29,798
SHE IS DEAD.

1329
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:32,801
LET ME THROUGH.
I'M A DOCTOR.

1330
01:09:32,836 --> 01:09:33,819
I'M A DOCTOR.

1331
01:09:33,854 --> 01:09:34,803
YOU'RE TOO LATE.

1332
01:09:35,304 --> 01:09:36,270
GOOD.

1333
01:09:36,305 --> 01:09:37,271
I MEAN, OH.

1334
01:09:37,306 --> 01:09:39,308
SHE'S BEAUTIFUL.

1335
01:09:40,309 --> 01:09:41,310
SHE'S PERFECT.

1336
01:09:42,811 --> 01:09:43,777
SHE'S ALIVE.

1337
01:09:43,812 --> 01:09:45,063
SHE'S DEAD. SHE'S DEAD.

1338
01:09:45,098 --> 01:09:46,315
SHE'S GOT TO BE DEAD!

1339
01:09:47,851 --> 01:09:49,318
DEAD, DEAD, DEAD.

1340
01:09:54,323 --> 01:09:55,789
CRAZY MANIAC!

1341
01:10:17,846 --> 01:10:19,848
NEED A BODY.
YEAH.

1342
01:10:29,858 --> 01:10:32,361
"IN DILMAN'S GROVE,

1343
01:10:32,396 --> 01:10:33,880
"MY LOVE

1344
01:10:33,915 --> 01:10:35,364
DID DIE."

1345
01:10:53,382 --> 01:10:54,383
DRIVER...

1346
01:10:55,384 --> 01:10:56,885
FOLLOW THAT CAR.

1347
01:12:07,406 --> 01:12:09,373
BEAUTIFUL.

1348
01:12:09,408 --> 01:12:12,411
WHERE CAN I SEE
THE REST OF YOU?

1349
01:12:13,412 --> 01:12:15,914
MAMA.

1350
01:12:18,917 --> 01:12:20,384
WHERE CAN WE GO?

1351
01:12:20,419 --> 01:12:22,921
WELL,
WE CAN GO TO MY ROOM.

1352
01:12:22,956 --> 01:12:24,923
IT'S ON
THE FOURTH FLOOR.

1353
01:12:24,958 --> 01:12:26,442
MY NAME'S FRAN.

1354
01:12:26,477 --> 01:12:27,891
I'M AN AMERICAN.

1355
01:12:27,926 --> 01:12:29,428
I GUESS YOU COULD SAY I'M
A MEMBER OF THE PIECE CORPS.

1356
01:12:29,463 --> 01:12:30,929
GET IT?

1357
01:12:30,964 --> 01:12:32,198
WHAT IS IT?

1358
01:12:32,233 --> 01:12:33,397
MY VOICE?

1359
01:12:33,432 --> 01:12:35,399
DID I BLOW THE DEAL?

1360
01:12:35,434 --> 01:12:37,936
I KNEW I SHOULDN'T TALK
UNTIL I MAKE THE DEAL.

1361
01:12:37,971 --> 01:12:39,455
I KNOW MY VOICE
IS TERRIBLE.

1362
01:12:39,490 --> 01:12:40,904
IT IRRITATES PEOPLE
SO MUCH

1363
01:12:40,939 --> 01:12:43,442
THEY USUALLY JUST WANT
TO KILL ME.

1364
01:12:43,477 --> 01:12:45,461
KEEP TALKING.
KEEP TALKING.

1365
01:12:45,496 --> 01:12:47,972
OH, GOOD.
I NEVER GET TO TALK.

1366
01:12:48,007 --> 01:12:50,449
MY WHOLE FAMILY
LOVES TO TALK.

1367
01:13:00,959 --> 01:13:02,426
COME ON IN, HONEY,

1368
01:13:02,461 --> 01:13:04,463
AND MAKE YOURSELF
AT HOME.

1369
01:13:04,498 --> 01:13:05,929
I'LL, UH...

1370
01:13:05,964 --> 01:13:07,431
BE RIGHT OUT, OK?

1371
01:13:07,466 --> 01:13:09,433
? DUKE, DUKE, DUKE?

1372
01:13:09,468 --> 01:13:10,469
? DUKE OF EARL, EARL?

1373
01:13:10,504 --> 01:13:11,435
YOU LIKE MUSIC?

1374
01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:13,472
THAT'S MY FAVORITE SONG,
YOU KNOW?

1375
01:13:13,972 --> 01:13:15,974
? DUKE OF EARL,
EARL, EARL?

1376
01:13:16,009 --> 01:13:17,976
? DUKE OF EARL,
EARL, EARL?

1377
01:13:18,011 --> 01:13:18,977
? DUKE OF EARL?

1378
01:13:19,478 --> 01:13:21,480
COME ON, DUKE, WE'RE
GOING TO HAVE SOME FUN.

1379
01:13:21,515 --> 01:13:23,482
? DUKE, DUKE, DUKE
OF EARL, EARL, EARL?

1380
01:13:34,993 --> 01:13:36,494
IT'S MURDER.

1381
01:13:36,529 --> 01:13:37,961
NO, IT'S NOT MURDER.

1382
01:13:37,996 --> 01:13:39,998
HER BODY WILL
STILL BE ALIVE...

1383
01:13:40,033 --> 01:13:40,964
? DUKE OF EARL

1384
01:13:40,999 --> 01:13:43,001
BUT HER MIND
WILL BE DEAD.

1385
01:13:43,036 --> 01:13:44,270
? DUKE OF EARL

1386
01:13:44,305 --> 01:13:45,504
BUT HER BODY...

1387
01:13:45,539 --> 01:13:46,470
HER BODY.

1388
01:13:46,505 --> 01:13:48,507
I CAN HAVE IT ALL-

1389
01:13:49,007 --> 01:13:50,759
THE PERFECT MIND

1390
01:13:50,794 --> 01:13:52,511
IN THE PERFECT BODY.

1391
01:13:52,546 --> 01:13:54,280
YES.

1392
01:13:54,315 --> 01:13:56,666
KILL.

1393
01:13:56,701 --> 01:13:58,982
YES.

1394
01:13:59,017 --> 01:14:00,484
YES. YES.

1395
01:14:00,519 --> 01:14:01,520
KILL HER. YES.

1396
01:14:01,555 --> 01:14:03,487
YES. YES.

1397
01:14:03,522 --> 01:14:06,525
KILL HER.
KILL, KILL, KILL.

1398
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:09,027
KILL HER. YES, YES.

1399
01:14:09,528 --> 01:14:11,029
I CAN'T.

1400
01:14:11,064 --> 01:14:12,496
CAN'T WHAT?

1401
01:14:12,531 --> 01:14:14,533
I CAN'T INJECT YOU
WITH WINDOW CLEANER.

1402
01:14:14,568 --> 01:14:15,534
I DON'T MIND.

1403
01:14:17,035 --> 01:14:19,037
HEY, WHAT DOES IT DO,
ANYWAY?

1404
01:14:19,538 --> 01:14:21,039
IT CAUSES YOUR BRAIN
TO DIE LAST.

1405
01:14:21,074 --> 01:14:22,040
I DON'T MIND.

1406
01:14:24,077 --> 01:14:26,044
IT'S MY VOICE.

1407
01:14:26,079 --> 01:14:27,212
DAMN.

1408
01:14:38,223 --> 01:14:39,189
WELL...

1409
01:14:39,224 --> 01:14:41,727
WHAT AREYOU
DOING HERE?

1410
01:14:58,744 --> 01:14:59,995
DOLORES.

1411
01:15:00,030 --> 01:15:01,211
YOU.

1412
01:15:01,246 --> 01:15:02,748
YOU'RE THE ELEVATOR
KILLER.

1413
01:15:05,250 --> 01:15:07,753
MERV GRIFFIN.

1414
01:15:07,788 --> 01:15:08,754
YEAH.

1415
01:15:10,255 --> 01:15:11,256
WHY?

1416
01:15:11,757 --> 01:15:13,759
I DON'T KNOW. I'VE ALWAYS
JUST LOVED TO KILL.

1417
01:15:13,794 --> 01:15:15,278
I'VE REALLY ENJOYED IT.

1418
01:15:15,313 --> 01:15:16,727
BUT THEN I GOT FAMOUS,

1419
01:15:16,762 --> 01:15:18,764
AND IT'S JUST
TOO HARD FOR ME.

1420
01:15:18,799 --> 01:15:20,230
I MEAN, SO MANY WITNESSES.

1421
01:15:20,265 --> 01:15:22,017
I MEAN, EVERYBODY
RECOGNIZED ME.

1422
01:15:22,052 --> 01:15:23,734
I COULDN'T EVEN LURK
ANYMORE.

1423
01:15:23,769 --> 01:15:25,771
I'D HEAR, "WHO'S THAT
LURKING OVER THERE?

1424
01:15:25,806 --> 01:15:27,540
ISN'T THAT MERV GRIFFIN?"

1425
01:15:27,575 --> 01:15:29,239
SO I CAME TO EUROPE
TO KILL,

1426
01:15:29,274 --> 01:15:32,778
AND IT'S REALLY WORKED OUT
VERY WELL FOR ME-

1427
01:15:32,813 --> 01:15:34,279
UNTIL NOW.

1428
01:15:41,787 --> 01:15:42,788
Michael:
SHE'S BEAUTIFUL.

1429
01:15:42,823 --> 01:15:43,754
YEAH, ISN'T SHE?

1430
01:15:43,789 --> 01:15:44,790
THIS MAY BE
THE ONE THING

1431
01:15:45,290 --> 01:15:46,792
THAT SAVES OUR MARRIAGE.

1432
01:15:47,292 --> 01:15:48,293
HEY, YOU GOING
TO TURN ME IN?

1433
01:15:48,328 --> 01:15:49,294
I DON'T HAVE TIME.

1434
01:15:49,795 --> 01:15:50,796
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO TURN YOURSELF IN.

1435
01:15:50,831 --> 01:15:52,297
PROMISE ME.
I PROMISE.

1436
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:57,803
I AM NEVER TAKING YOU
ANYWHERE AGAIN.

1437
01:16:12,818 --> 01:16:14,820
ANNE, ARE YOU
ALL RIGHT?

1438
01:16:14,855 --> 01:16:16,321
I'M VERY...

1439
01:16:16,356 --> 01:16:17,322
VERY SLEEPY.

1440
01:16:17,823 --> 01:16:18,323
ANNE,

1441
01:16:18,824 --> 01:16:19,825
STAY AWAKE.

1442
01:16:20,325 --> 01:16:22,828
LOOK, I GOT
MERV GRIFFIN'S AUTOGRAPH.

1443
01:16:22,863 --> 01:16:23,846
I'M SLEEPY.

1444
01:16:23,881 --> 01:16:24,830
OH, MY GOD.

1445
01:16:36,708 --> 01:16:38,176
MICHAEL...

1446
01:16:38,211 --> 01:16:39,678
ANNE, STAY WITH ME.

1447
01:16:39,713 --> 01:16:40,644

HUH?

1450
01:17:06,705 --> 01:17:07,956
OH, I'M SORRY, OFFICER.

1451
01:17:07,991 --> 01:17:09,207
OH, YOU SPEAK ENGLISH?

1452
01:17:09,242 --> 01:17:10,709
GOOD.

1453
01:17:14,713 --> 01:17:17,215
THAT'S BETTER. WE HAVE
MORE ROOM DOWN THERE NOW.

1454
01:17:17,716 --> 01:17:18,717
LICENSE?

1455
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:23,722
DOCTOR...

01:17:25,223 --> 01:17:26,224
HFUHRUHURR?

1457
01:17:26,259 --> 01:17:27,726
YES.

1458
01:17:28,226 --> 01:17:29,192
WHAT'S THE RUSH?

1459
01:17:29,227 --> 01:17:30,729
AND WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH HER?

1460
01:17:30,764 --> 01:17:31,730
SHE'S JUST DRUNK-

1461
01:17:31,765 --> 01:17:32,998
DEAD DRUNK.

1462
01:17:33,033 --> 01:17:34,133
UH-HUH.

YOU HAVE A LITTLE

1465
01:17:36,770 --> 01:17:38,236
OH, NO, NO, NO,

GET OUT OF THE CAR.

1469
01:17:46,745 --> 01:17:47,711
STRETCH OUT YOUR ARMS

1470
01:17:47,746 --> 01:17:50,749
AND TOUCH YOUR NOSE
WITH YOUR FINGER.

NOW DO ROLL OVER, TURN
OVER, AND FLIP-FLOP.

1478
01:18:21,279 --> 01:18:23,246
ALL RIGHT.

1479
01:18:23,281 --> 01:18:26,249
NOW JUGGLE THESE,
DO A TAP DANCE, AND SING

1480
01:18:26,284 --> 01:18:29,788
THE CATALINA MAGDALENA
LUPENSTEINER WALLABEINER SONG.

1481
01:18:29,823 --> 01:18:32,290
GODDAMN, YOUR
DRUNK TESTS ARE HARD.

1482
01:18:33,291 --> 01:18:34,257
? CATALINA MAGDALENA?

1483
01:18:34,292 --> 01:18:35,759

WALLABEINER?

1484
01:18:35,794 --> 01:18:37,295

WHAT'S HER NAME??

1485
01:18:39,297 --> 01:18:41,800
ALL RIGHT,

1486
01:18:41,835 --> 01:18:43,319
YOU CAN GO.

1487
01:18:43,354 --> 01:18:44,803
MY ORANGES.

01:18:47,806 --> 01:18:49,808
NOW DRIVE CAREFULLY.

1489
01:18:49,843 --> 01:18:50,774
WAIT!

1490
01:18:50,809 --> 01:18:51,810
SHE'S NOT DRUNK.

01:18:51,845 --> 01:18:53,078
SHE'S DEAD!

1492
01:18:53,113 --> 01:18:54,277
DEAD? MY GOD,

1493
01:18:54,312 --> 01:18:56,815
I BETTER GET HER
TO A CEMETERY RIGHT AWAY.

1494
01:19:00,318 --> 01:19:01,820
Officer:
OH, MY GOD. OHH!

1495
01:19:08,827 --> 01:19:09,793

1498
01:19:18,336 --> 01:19:20,338
ROTE MERCEDES.

01:20:12,891 --> 01:20:14,893
NECESSITER!

1506
01:20:15,894 --> 01:20:17,896

01:20:21,399 --> 01:20:22,365
Woman:JA?

EXCUSE ME. COULD WE
BORROW A BATTERING RAM?

1510
01:20:24,437 --> 01:20:25,403
YOU'LL RETURN IT?

1511
01:20:25,438 --> 01:20:26,404
JA.

CHEER UP, DEAR BOY.
HAVE A DRINK.

1523
01:21:11,484 --> 01:21:12,951
THERE'S NO TIME
FOR DRINKS.

1524
01:21:12,986 --> 01:21:13,917
ANNE IS DYING.

1525
01:21:13,952 --> 01:21:16,955
YOU'RE DYING, I'M DYING,
MY MACHINE IS DYING.

1526
01:21:16,990 --> 01:21:18,421
MY WONDERFUL MACHINE.

1527
01:21:18,456 --> 01:21:20,958
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

1528
01:21:20,993 --> 01:21:23,426
IT WON'T START.
IT'S BROKEN.

1529
01:21:23,461 --> 01:21:25,964
WELL, THERE MUST BE
SOME WAY TO FIX IT.

1530
01:21:25,999 --> 01:21:27,465
AAH!

1531
01:21:27,966 --> 01:21:28,932
OOH!

1532
01:21:28,967 --> 01:21:30,969
INSPECTOR, INSPECTOR.

1533
01:21:34,439 --> 01:21:36,406
DR. NECESSITER.

1534
01:21:36,441 --> 01:21:37,692
THE TRANSFORMER
OF YOUR MACHINE-

1535
01:21:37,727 --> 01:21:39,586
ARE YOU AWARE
IT'S COIN-OPERATED?

1536
01:21:39,621 --> 01:21:41,411
GOOD LORD.
I FORGOT ALL ABOUT THAT.

1537
01:21:41,446 --> 01:21:44,900
WHEN I BUILT THE MACHINE
I USED THE GUTS OF A VIDEO GAME.

1538
01:21:44,935 --> 01:21:46,168
QUARTERS, QUARTERS.

1539
01:21:46,203 --> 01:21:47,367
I'VE GOT 6 QUARTERS.

1540
01:21:47,402 --> 01:21:50,405
JUST ENOUGH
FOR THE TRANSFERENCE.

1541
01:21:52,908 --> 01:21:53,909
ALL RIGHT?

1542
01:21:53,944 --> 01:21:54,927
ALL RIGHT.

1543
01:21:54,962 --> 01:21:55,876
ALL RIGHT?

1544
01:21:55,911 --> 01:21:57,412
ALL RIGHT.

1545
01:21:57,913 --> 01:21:58,879
READY NOW.

1546
01:21:58,914 --> 01:22:00,916
SET THE HEMOFARCAL
OVERLOAD,.6.

1547
01:22:00,951 --> 01:22:03,418
HEMOFARCAL
OVERLOAD,.6.

1548
01:22:06,922 --> 01:22:13,894
SEPTUM LUDEGATION
FACTOR O3.5.

1549
01:22:13,929 --> 01:22:18,934
AORTIC PETRIFICATION

1550
01:22:22,437 --> 01:22:24,439
SET THE THERAMIN

1551
01:22:24,474 --> 01:22:26,458

1560
01:22:54,469 --> 01:22:57,472
STOP! YOU'RE UNDER
ARREST FOR MURDER.

1561
01:22:57,507 --> 01:22:58,991
WE ARE NOT MURDERING!

1562
01:22:59,026 --> 01:23:00,440
WE ARE RESURRECTING!

1563
01:23:00,475 --> 01:23:01,476
MOVING LIFE FROM ONE BODY
TO ANOTHER!

1564
01:23:01,977 --> 01:23:03,478
YOU ARE PLAYING GOD!

1565
01:23:03,513 --> 01:23:04,945
SOMEBODY HAS TO!

1566
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:06,446
THE DOGMAS OF THE QUIET PAST

1567
01:23:06,481 --> 01:23:08,448
ARE INADEQUATE
FOR THE STORMY PRESENT!

1568
01:23:08,483 --> 01:23:11,486
THE OCCASION IN PILED HIGH
WITH DIFFICULTY,

1569
01:23:11,521 --> 01:23:13,488
AND WE MUST RISE

1570
01:23:13,989 --> 01:23:16,456
WHOO! FOR COPIES

1572
01:23:21,531 --> 01:23:22,998
HE'S CRAZY.

1573
01:23:23,033 --> 01:23:24,464
AAH!

1574
01:23:33,508 --> 01:23:35,510
AAH!

1575
01:23:41,016 --> 01:23:42,017
DON'T TOUCH THAT!

1576
01:24:00,035 --> 01:24:04,539
WELL, THE OPERATION
SEEMS TO BE A SUCCESS...

1577
01:24:07,042 --> 01:24:10,045
BUT THE DOCTOR DIED.

1578
01:24:13,014 --> 01:24:14,481
UH...

1579
01:24:14,516 --> 01:24:15,517
WHERE AM I?

1580
01:24:16,017 --> 01:24:18,520
YOU'RE IN OUR OWN
HOSPITAL, MY BOY.

1581
01:24:18,555 --> 01:24:20,289
HOW LONG HAVE I BEEN HERE?

1582
01:24:20,324 --> 01:24:22,023
YOU'VE BEEN HERE
6 WEEKS.

1583
01:24:22,058 --> 01:24:23,990
YOUR WIFE IS HERE.

1584
01:24:24,025 --> 01:24:25,026
SHE'S IN
THE WAITING ROOM.

1585
01:24:25,061 --> 01:24:26,545
WHOSE BRAIN DOES SHE HAVE?

1586
01:24:26,580 --> 01:24:28,029
WHOSE BRAIN
DOES SHE HAVE?

1587
01:24:28,064 --> 01:24:30,799
DOES SHE TALK...

1588
01:24:30,834 --> 01:24:33,535
OR DOES SHE GO...

1589
01:24:36,037 --> 01:24:38,039
NO, SHE TALKS,
MICHAEL.

1590
01:24:39,343 --> 01:24:40,507
NO, NO, NO.

1591
01:24:40,542 --> 01:24:42,293
YOU'VE BEEN
IN BED 6 WEEKS.

1592
01:24:42,328 --> 01:24:44,045
YOU DON'T HAVE
THE STRENGTH.

1593
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:45,564
I'M STRONG ENOUGH.

1594
01:24:45,599 --> 01:24:47,048
I WANT TO SEE HER.

1595
01:24:47,549 --> 01:24:50,051
NURSE, TELL MRS. HUFFER
THE DOCTOR'S AWAKE.

1596
01:24:50,552 --> 01:24:53,054
HFUHRUHURR.

1597
01:24:53,089 --> 01:24:54,521
WAIT.

1598
01:24:54,556 --> 01:24:59,060
I DON'T WANT HER
TO SEE ME LIKE THIS.

1599
01:24:59,095 --> 01:25:02,564
I WANT TO BE ON MY OWN 2 FEET.

1600
01:25:13,074 --> 01:25:14,541
THERE.

1601
01:25:14,576 --> 01:25:17,579
YOUR HUSBAND IS AWAKE
AND CAN SEE YOU.

1602
01:25:17,614 --> 01:25:19,080
HE'S AWAKE?

1603
01:25:21,082 --> 01:25:22,048
WHAT'S WRONG?

1604
01:25:22,083 --> 01:25:26,588
I NEVER TOLD HIM
I WAS A COMPULSIVE EATER.

1605
01:25:26,623 --> 01:25:28,590
I'VE GAINED SO MUCH WEIGHT.

1606
01:25:32,594 --> 01:25:34,095
MICHAEL.

1607
01:25:49,110 --> 01:25:50,076
ANNE...

1608
01:25:50,111 --> 01:25:52,614
UUMELLMAHAYE?

1609
01:25:53,114 --> 01:25:54,115
YES, MICHAEL.

1610
