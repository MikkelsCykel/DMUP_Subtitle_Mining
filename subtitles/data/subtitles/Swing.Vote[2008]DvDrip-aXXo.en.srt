SWING VOTE

2
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:07,876
<i>After a hotly contested race,</i>
<i>Americans go to the polls today...</i>

3
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,757
<i>in what promises to be</i>
<i>a very close election.</i>

4
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:14,682
<i>The Republican Andrew Boone,</i>
<i>hoping to hold on to the Oval Office...</i>

5
00:01:14,697 --> 00:01:17,018
<i>by edging out...</i>

6
00:01:17,033 --> 00:01:19,331
<i>the Democratic challenger</i>
<i>Donald Greenleaf.</i>

7
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:43,007
Bud...
Bud.

8
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,019
Bud!

9
00:01:49,065 --> 00:01:50,507
I'll call...
I'll call him back.

10
00:01:51,233 --> 00:01:54,100
If we had a phone, you could.
Come on!

11
00:01:56,806 --> 00:01:59,400
Goddamnit! It's cold.

12
00:01:59,475 --> 00:02:02,376
We're gonna be late again.
You need a shower.

13
00:02:03,346 --> 00:02:05,371
Can't believe
you slept in your clothes!

14
00:02:16,859 --> 00:02:18,349
Leave me any hot water?

15
00:02:19,295 --> 00:02:21,889
I don't know.
Water heater fix itself?

16
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:27,257
Christ, Molly! Why don't you
just take the day off, okay?

17
00:02:27,269 --> 00:02:28,930
I'll write you a note.

18
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,974
Now!
I'm not going to tell you again!

19
00:02:35,144 --> 00:02:35,940
Get up!

20
00:02:45,655 --> 00:02:46,349
<i>Bud!</i>

21
00:02:47,189 --> 00:02:48,884
Alright, I'm coming!

22
00:03:23,993 --> 00:03:26,518
- What?
- Egg salad.

23
00:03:27,563 --> 00:03:28,257
Again?

24
00:03:29,065 --> 00:03:30,430
You like egg salad.

25
00:03:30,499 --> 00:03:35,027
Well, not every damn day I don't.
You could mix it up a little.

26
00:03:35,271 --> 00:03:36,329
We're on a budget.

27
00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:39,207
You wanna eat better?
Drink less beer.

28
00:03:41,844 --> 00:03:43,573
- Fine.
- Fine.

29
00:03:45,081 --> 00:03:48,881
- And don't forget today.
- What's... what's today?

30
00:03:49,452 --> 00:03:50,783
Election day, dummy!

31
00:03:51,053 --> 00:03:54,045
I'm supposed to do a report
on you voting, remember?

32
00:03:54,123 --> 00:03:56,921
I already told you before
I'm not even registered.

33
00:03:57,193 --> 00:03:59,377
I registered for you
in the mail.

34
00:03:59,395 --> 00:04:02,364
That's great,
I could get jury duty now.

35
00:04:02,565 --> 00:04:05,796
- It's your civic responsibility.
- It's my civic, my what?

36
00:04:05,968 --> 00:04:07,663
It's your civic responsibility.

37
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:10,332
My civic responsibility?
Where you learning this crap?

38
00:04:11,607 --> 00:04:12,904
Mrs. Abernathy.

39
00:04:13,075 --> 00:04:15,270
Well, stay away from her.

40
00:04:16,846 --> 00:04:18,040
She's my teacher.

41
00:04:43,806 --> 00:04:44,602
Sign this.

42
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:48,269
What is it?

43
00:04:48,878 --> 00:04:52,041
A questionnaire. I'm supposed
to ask you about your politics.

44
00:04:52,948 --> 00:04:55,143
Well, go ahead.

45
00:04:55,251 --> 00:04:56,309
I already filled it in.

46
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,051
I wanted you to sound smart.

47
00:05:01,991 --> 00:05:03,424
Give me
the first question anyway.

48
00:05:07,163 --> 00:05:08,824
What's your political affiliation?

49
00:05:11,567 --> 00:05:15,059
Alright,
I'm a conscious objector.

50
00:05:15,571 --> 00:05:19,860
It's not a war, Bud. It's an election.
And you are an independent.

51
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:23,402
Independent? Why in the hell
would I be an independent?

52
00:05:23,946 --> 00:05:25,368
Because the two party system...

53
00:05:25,381 --> 00:05:28,407
has neglected the needs
of the working poor.

54
00:05:28,818 --> 00:05:30,308
- Let me tell you something, baby...
- Here we go again.

55
00:05:32,888 --> 00:05:35,880
The voting doesn't count
for a goddamn thing.

56
00:05:36,158 --> 00:05:38,888
Just a way to make you feel
like you're in control of something.

57
00:05:39,461 --> 00:05:43,522
It doesn't matter who you vote for,
we can't afford insurance and...

58
00:05:43,532 --> 00:05:47,593
if you get sick, I'm gonna have
to start selling my blood again.

59
00:05:47,736 --> 00:05:51,558
Mrs. Abernathy said every vote counts.
It's a social contract.

60
00:05:51,574 --> 00:05:56,204
It's a social contract.
This Mrs. Abernathy is full of shit.

61
00:06:16,031 --> 00:06:17,931
Meet me at the polling place
after work.

62
00:06:18,634 --> 00:06:19,293
Fine.

63
00:06:24,506 --> 00:06:25,700
You forgetting something?

64
00:06:29,311 --> 00:06:32,712
Bud, screw this up
and I'm leaving you.

65
00:06:38,554 --> 00:06:39,384
Do good!

66
00:07:09,518 --> 00:07:10,075
Where...

67
00:07:12,488 --> 00:07:13,614
Where the hell is Dewey?

68
00:07:14,723 --> 00:07:15,883
He got laid off.

69
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:18,449
Bullshit! He got insourced.

70
00:07:19,395 --> 00:07:20,362
Insourced?

71
00:07:20,562 --> 00:07:24,362
Insourced. Instead of exporting
our jobs to Mexico...

72
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,128
they're importing Mexicans
to take our jobs.

73
00:07:27,636 --> 00:07:29,194
You're paranoid,
you know that?

74
00:07:30,005 --> 00:07:34,169
<i>Attention! The opening</i>
<i>this morning is officially cancelled.</i>

75
00:07:37,646 --> 00:07:40,046
I can't even read
the damn signs no more!

76
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:43,944
Our days are numbered, fellas.
You mark my words!

77
00:07:44,353 --> 00:07:46,617
These hombres work twice
as hard for half the money.

78
00:07:46,889 --> 00:07:50,017
I just figure they need this job
twice as bad as us!

79
00:07:50,926 --> 00:07:53,087
Whose side are you on?

80
00:07:53,329 --> 00:07:57,322
I don't take sides, Lowell.
Just stating the obvious.

81
00:07:59,268 --> 00:08:01,702
Next thing, they'll be taking
away our right to vote.

82
00:08:02,738 --> 00:08:03,636
You voting, Bud?

83
00:08:04,273 --> 00:08:06,366
It's a social contract,
isn't it?

84
00:08:07,543 --> 00:08:09,101
Who are you voting for?

85
00:08:11,046 --> 00:08:12,445
Shit if I know!

86
00:08:16,218 --> 00:08:21,383
I think I picked up a couple shades.
Looks like an eight.

87
00:08:21,623 --> 00:08:22,647
What do you think, Marty?

88
00:08:24,093 --> 00:08:25,890
I don't like
the margin in Florida.

89
00:08:26,061 --> 00:08:29,724
Bus some young Republicans down
to the polling stations in Palm Beach.

90
00:08:29,965 --> 00:08:34,368
Make sure they're tall,
they're blonde and they're men.

91
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:39,604
Because old Jews see a pack
of angry young white males...

92
00:08:39,742 --> 00:08:42,438
and they're gonna think twice
about getting out of their car!

93
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:47,672
Kennedy was a nine.
And he put a man on the moon.

94
00:08:50,419 --> 00:08:53,604
That's what we need.
Something to shoot for.

95
00:08:53,622 --> 00:08:56,921
A defining moment.
Like... I don't know.

96
00:09:00,095 --> 00:09:01,221
Cure for cancer.

97
00:09:05,267 --> 00:09:08,020
Ohio run the gay marriage
ad every twenty minutes.

98
00:09:08,037 --> 00:09:10,426
Let's see if we can't get those God
fearing bastards off the fence.

99
00:09:10,439 --> 00:09:12,999
We take a bunch of scientists,
put them in the desert somewhere.

100
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:16,594
Like the Manhattan project. Are you
listening to me? I'm serious about this.

101
00:09:16,612 --> 00:09:19,399
I think that cancer is going to be
a tough nut to crack in one term, sir.

102
00:09:19,415 --> 00:09:20,780
So, we make it a ten year plan.

103
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:23,381
- Lincoln got to see the end of slavery?
- No.

104
00:09:23,852 --> 00:09:25,843
- Did Kennedy get to see the moon shot?
- Nope.

105
00:09:26,021 --> 00:09:30,117
No! But they got the credit!
It's the idea that counts.

106
00:09:30,259 --> 00:09:33,319
The guy that sets the goal
gets in the history books!

107
00:09:33,796 --> 00:09:37,687
Hope and positivity! Marty,
the American people want a bright...

108
00:09:37,699 --> 00:09:41,157
shining smile to represent
the promise of this country.

109
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:43,101
Take old Georgie there.

110
00:09:45,074 --> 00:09:48,635
Boy, he was off the charts.

111
00:09:50,012 --> 00:09:51,309
They wanted to make him King.

112
00:09:52,815 --> 00:09:53,747
Son of a gun!

113
00:10:07,863 --> 00:10:10,161
Thank you,
thank you for coming.

114
00:10:11,733 --> 00:10:16,033
Galena and I would like
to thank America...

115
00:10:16,438 --> 00:10:18,633
for this glorious opportunity.

116
00:10:18,774 --> 00:10:22,733
I have met people of every race,
color and creed...

117
00:10:22,811 --> 00:10:24,608
during this long campaign.

118
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:28,773
I pledge to you that my White House
will be a rainbow house.

119
00:10:28,851 --> 00:10:31,979
It'll be open to people
of all colors and creeds.

120
00:10:32,488 --> 00:10:35,855
Now, please, go and vote.
We need your support.

121
00:10:42,498 --> 00:10:44,056
That was great.
I'm gonna go do press.

122
00:10:44,199 --> 00:10:44,688
Great.

123
00:10:49,204 --> 00:10:53,436
Greenleaf! Greenleaf!

124
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:56,205
Gallup has you down by a point.

125
00:10:56,278 --> 00:11:00,374
CNN, USA Today, has us up by two.
News has us down by sixty.

126
00:11:00,449 --> 00:11:02,747
What message are you trying
to get out to the undecideds today?

127
00:11:02,818 --> 00:11:06,140
The same message we put out yesterday,
last week and last year...

128
00:11:06,155 --> 00:11:08,715
when we started this campaign
and that's why we're going to win.

129
00:11:08,957 --> 00:11:12,518
Because we have the answers.
Not platitudes and jingoistic rhetoric.

130
00:11:12,694 --> 00:11:15,254
This is the truth
train operation real deal.

131
00:11:15,364 --> 00:11:18,925
In recent days, the president
has aired ads claiming Greenleaf...

132
00:11:18,934 --> 00:11:20,822
has vacationed
at a nudist colony.

133
00:11:20,836 --> 00:11:23,532
Come on, now, that's a tired
accusation. It's pure fiction.

134
00:11:23,705 --> 00:11:27,300
- Then, how do you answer for the photos?
- Right wing blogo-smear, that's how.

135
00:11:27,309 --> 00:11:31,234
I could stand here and perpetuate
the rumor that as a young man...

136
00:11:31,246 --> 00:11:34,841
the president had a gambling addiction,
but I'm got going to sink to their level.

137
00:11:35,284 --> 00:11:38,276
Despite eye witness
accounts and documentation.

138
00:11:38,287 --> 00:11:39,948
They sling mud,
we sling ideas.

139
00:11:40,022 --> 00:11:43,924
Still, if Greenleaf loses,
you'll be 0 for 7 on the national scene.

140
00:11:45,561 --> 00:11:48,997
Thank you, Betty. Sorry, folks,
that's all I have time for.

141
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,598
Leeches!

142
00:11:52,501 --> 00:11:54,628
Why it's important to vote.

143
00:11:54,703 --> 00:11:57,467
Many brave soldiers
sacrificed themselves.

144
00:11:57,639 --> 00:11:59,402
A right we take for granted.

145
00:12:00,008 --> 00:12:01,999
- For the people.
- By the people.

146
00:12:02,311 --> 00:12:04,176
We the people!

147
00:12:05,214 --> 00:12:06,704
I can't read my writing.

148
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:10,579
All the world's great civilizations
have followed the same path.

149
00:12:10,953 --> 00:12:14,548
From bondage, to liberty,
from liberty to abundance...

150
00:12:14,756 --> 00:12:18,852
from abundance to complacency.
From complacency to apathy...

151
00:12:19,194 --> 00:12:21,253
from apathy back to bondage.

152
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:25,232
If we're to be the exception to history,
then we must break the cycle.

153
00:12:25,968 --> 00:12:29,460
For those who do not remember
the past are condemned to repeat it.

154
00:12:33,575 --> 00:12:35,634
Very good, everybody.
Very good.

155
00:12:37,479 --> 00:12:38,309
Hold this.

156
00:12:38,547 --> 00:12:42,142
Okay, remember, no running
till you get out to the playground.

157
00:12:42,584 --> 00:12:45,303
Your last one was great.
I'd like to use it on the news.

158
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,184
- Molly?
- Yes.

159
00:12:46,421 --> 00:12:47,581
Molly, come here.

160
00:12:48,624 --> 00:12:51,843
This is Ms. Madison.
She's the reporter from the news.

161
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,248
- Hi, Molly.
- Hi.

162
00:12:53,262 --> 00:12:54,490
- How you doing?
- Good.

163
00:12:54,563 --> 00:12:56,997
Your essay was very thoughtful.

164
00:12:57,332 --> 00:12:58,094
Thanks.

165
00:12:58,467 --> 00:13:00,992
Ms. Madison is going
to show your essay tonight.

166
00:13:01,003 --> 00:13:02,994
- Isn't that exciting?
- Yes, madam.

167
00:13:03,071 --> 00:13:06,507
Tell me something. What do you
want to be when you grow up?

168
00:13:09,678 --> 00:13:13,978
I go back and forth. Either
a veterinarian or chairman of the Fed.

169
00:13:18,687 --> 00:13:19,483
Where's Bud?

170
00:13:19,888 --> 00:13:24,382
Went to take a leak half an hour ago.
I heard his name over the loudspeaker.

171
00:13:25,661 --> 00:13:26,889
What'd you have for lunch?

172
00:13:27,262 --> 00:13:30,356
- Egg salad. You?
- Hard boiled.

173
00:13:35,837 --> 00:13:36,599
Hey, Bud.

174
00:13:39,508 --> 00:13:40,998
Just giving you a heads up.

175
00:13:43,812 --> 00:13:46,076
Management wants us
to cut another ten percent.

176
00:13:46,581 --> 00:13:50,779
Well,
you are management, Carl.

177
00:13:51,119 --> 00:13:54,418
Look, you haven't punched
in on time in six months.

178
00:13:54,656 --> 00:14:00,390
So, I'm five minutes late every once
in a while. What is the big whoop?

179
00:14:00,462 --> 00:14:04,159
You took thirty-one
sick days this year, Bud.

180
00:14:06,034 --> 00:14:10,027
Well, I gotta kid, Carl.
She brings it home from school.

181
00:14:29,024 --> 00:14:30,685
<i>Shit! Goddamnit!</i>

182
00:14:51,546 --> 00:14:53,741
Well, hell, Carl!

183
00:14:54,616 --> 00:14:57,517
You could have showed me
your footage when you walked in.

184
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:03,054
I know we went to school together, Bud.
I've always liked you.

185
00:15:04,226 --> 00:15:07,024
You gotta give me one good
reason why I should keep you.

186
00:15:10,098 --> 00:15:11,360
Why I can keep you.

187
00:15:43,498 --> 00:15:44,590
All hellsabelle!

188
00:15:49,438 --> 00:15:50,962
Sorry you lost your job.

189
00:15:51,106 --> 00:15:54,041
That's alright, Henry. Just...

190
00:15:56,244 --> 00:16:01,705
As soon as take your money,
I'm going from fired to retired.

191
00:16:02,317 --> 00:16:04,046
- Hey, Bud!
- Yes?

192
00:16:04,486 --> 00:16:05,919
Molly is on TV!

193
00:16:07,823 --> 00:16:09,620
- <i>Apathy back to bondage.</i>
- Geez!

194
00:16:09,925 --> 00:16:13,691
<i>If we are to be the exception to history,</i>
<i>then we must break the cycle.</i>

195
00:16:14,529 --> 00:16:16,759
- Curly, what time you got?
- Nine past seven.

196
00:16:17,566 --> 00:16:18,191
God!

197
00:16:19,968 --> 00:16:22,630
God, man! Shit!

198
00:16:41,389 --> 00:16:42,720
Goddamnit!

199
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:25,746
PLEASE,
INSERT YOUR BALLOT

200
00:19:25,754 --> 00:19:29,417
ERROR CODE - RESTART

201
00:20:32,053 --> 00:20:33,577
I hurt the top of my head.

202
00:20:34,489 --> 00:20:35,478
Come on, lay down.

203
00:20:47,268 --> 00:20:48,997
I'm so sorry, baby.

204
00:21:00,181 --> 00:21:01,671
I want to live with Mom.

205
00:21:07,522 --> 00:21:08,181
Me too.

206
00:21:23,404 --> 00:21:26,658
<i>New Mexico</i>
<i>is a classic swing state.</i>

207
00:21:26,674 --> 00:21:28,301
- <i>Mrs. Madison?</i>
- Speaking.

208
00:21:28,543 --> 00:21:31,307
<i>I'm calling</i>
<i>from the New Mexico election board.</i>

209
00:21:31,379 --> 00:21:34,132
- The what?
- <i>The New Mexico election board.</i>

210
00:21:34,149 --> 00:21:37,983
<i>Madam, did you cast your vote</i>
<i>at a Texico polling station last night?</i>

211
00:21:38,286 --> 00:21:40,311
I voted in the morning.

212
00:21:40,455 --> 00:21:42,343
<i>In the morning. Alright.</i>

213
00:21:42,357 --> 00:21:43,255
Is there something the matter?

214
00:21:43,558 --> 00:21:46,049
<i>No, no, sorry to bother you.</i>

215
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:48,722
<i>It is amazing. With every state</i>
<i>but New Mexico reporting...</i>

216
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:51,490
<i>we're now in a dead heat</i>
<i>for the American presidency.</i>

217
00:21:51,633 --> 00:21:54,625
<i>Each candidate with virtually</i>
<i>the same amount of electoral votes.</i>

218
00:21:54,702 --> 00:21:58,627
<i>270, the magic number to win.</i>
<i>This is a real photo finish!</i>

219
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,904
<i>And it goes to whoever wins</i>
<i>the popular vote in the state.</i>

220
00:22:00,975 --> 00:22:03,705
<i>All five electoral college votes</i>
<i>then swing to that party.</i>

221
00:22:03,778 --> 00:22:05,996
<i>Well, they don't call it the land</i>
<i>of enchantment for nothing.</i>

222
00:22:06,014 --> 00:22:08,608
<i>Whoever takes New Mexico,</i>
<i>takes the White House.</i>

223
00:22:08,683 --> 00:22:13,916
<i>It's déjà vu again. 2000 presidential</i>
<i>election came down to Dade County.</i>

224
00:22:13,988 --> 00:22:19,051
<i>400 votes in the state of Florida,</i>
<i>out of a total of 105 million cast.</i>

225
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:23,827
<i>If this is a certified tie, neither the</i>
<i>candidate would receive the majority.</i>

226
00:22:24,065 --> 00:22:27,694
<i>Do we even have a president</i>
<i>to deal with this?</i>

227
00:22:27,836 --> 00:22:30,964
<i>Pursuant to the 12th amendment, the</i>
<i>House of Representatives would decide.</i>

228
00:22:30,972 --> 00:22:32,894
<i>That hasn't happened since...</i>

229
00:22:32,907 --> 00:22:37,674
<i>John Quincy Adams defeated</i>
<i>Andrew Jackson back in 1824.</i>

230
00:22:37,812 --> 00:22:39,370
<i>We're talking rare.</i>

231
00:22:39,647 --> 00:22:42,810
<i>No, this isn't a great civics lesson</i>
<i>to the people of this country?</i>

232
00:22:43,051 --> 00:22:48,011
<i>If anyone in New Mexico didn't vote,</i>
<i>he be kicking themselves right now.</i>

233
00:22:48,022 --> 00:22:52,652
<i>The latest reports coming in,</i>
<i>Curry County still too close to call.</i>

234
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:56,719
<i>This election is down to a single</i>
<i>county. Is this even possible?</i>

235
00:22:57,899 --> 00:23:01,665
Listen, John, there's only 653
registered voters in Texico.

236
00:23:01,736 --> 00:23:03,363
<i>And they've already</i>
<i>recounted those votes.</i>

237
00:23:03,438 --> 00:23:07,135
I know. With that information
and a dollar, I could buy a chalupa!

238
00:23:07,275 --> 00:23:09,743
Everyone I know who voted
has been personally called.

239
00:23:10,645 --> 00:23:11,703
So what?

240
00:23:12,013 --> 00:23:14,504
So, the election. The fact
that it's down to Curry County...

241
00:23:14,849 --> 00:23:16,783
it has something
to do with Texico.

242
00:23:17,819 --> 00:23:19,719
Oh my God. Call you back!

243
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:39,669
Bud!

244
00:23:41,709 --> 00:23:42,232
Come on!

245
00:23:43,778 --> 00:23:46,246
God, my head!

246
00:23:50,718 --> 00:23:52,811
What? What time is it?

247
00:23:53,087 --> 00:23:54,486
There's some people
here to see you.

248
00:23:55,523 --> 00:23:56,251
Some people?

249
00:23:57,058 --> 00:23:58,252
They look official.

250
00:24:01,562 --> 00:24:04,463
- Child services?
- That's what I'm thinking.

251
00:24:16,377 --> 00:24:18,345
- Okay.
- Here we go.

252
00:24:23,785 --> 00:24:26,948
Mr. Johnson, we would have called first,
but you don't have a telephone.

253
00:24:27,388 --> 00:24:31,415
No, no, no, we got a phone.

254
00:24:31,993 --> 00:24:34,848
It's just not connected right now.
But I'm on it, you know.

255
00:24:34,862 --> 00:24:37,854
I'm not gonna say it's been easy
since the wife left, but...

256
00:24:38,032 --> 00:24:40,227
- we're getting on fine.
- Sure are.

257
00:24:40,435 --> 00:24:45,737
And I'm gonna pay these off, I swear.
Just as soon as I find a new job.

258
00:24:45,907 --> 00:24:47,966
- A new job?
- Yes.

259
00:24:48,209 --> 00:24:53,272
I used to be in this Willy Nelson
tribute band. I was thinking about...

260
00:24:53,281 --> 00:24:58,082
getting the guys back together again,
soon as our bass player gets paroled.

261
00:24:58,386 --> 00:25:01,184
And the drinking, I know it,
I know it looks bad.

262
00:25:01,689 --> 00:25:05,090
And licking that sucker
is at the top of my list.

263
00:25:05,593 --> 00:25:08,153
Please don't take away from me.

264
00:25:09,464 --> 00:25:11,227
I'll do anything you say,
I swear.

265
00:25:13,501 --> 00:25:14,968
She's just my only good thing.

266
00:25:15,636 --> 00:25:18,230
Mr. Johnson,
we're not from Social Services.

267
00:25:20,008 --> 00:25:20,565
No?

268
00:25:21,442 --> 00:25:23,034
We're from the State
Election Bureau.

269
00:25:23,745 --> 00:25:27,044
Fuck! Thank you, Jesus!

270
00:25:30,051 --> 00:25:33,384
I'm Secretary of State Brower.
And this is Attorney General Wyatt.

271
00:25:33,454 --> 00:25:36,252
Mr. Johnson,
did you cast your vote last night?

272
00:25:37,458 --> 00:25:38,618
Last night, did you vote?

273
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:45,328
That's right,
it's my civic duty, isn't it?

274
00:25:45,566 --> 00:25:46,692
Indeed it is.

275
00:25:47,535 --> 00:25:50,504
Mr. Johnson,
is this your signature?

276
00:25:55,443 --> 00:25:56,375
I guess.

277
00:25:56,644 --> 00:25:57,963
You guess it's your signature?

278
00:25:57,979 --> 00:26:02,541
No, no. That's right.
That's my signature.

279
00:26:03,117 --> 00:26:04,379
Did you retain your stub?

280
00:26:05,753 --> 00:26:06,583
What stub?

281
00:26:07,021 --> 00:26:09,285
The perforated stub
on top of your ballot.

282
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:21,830
Where's that perforated stub
that I gave you for your school project?

283
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:23,232
I've got it.

284
00:26:35,683 --> 00:26:36,377
It's him.

285
00:26:36,884 --> 00:26:39,045
Yeah, it's him. What do you mean,
"him?" Me, him?

286
00:26:41,189 --> 00:26:42,486
Sir, your vote didn't count.

287
00:26:43,257 --> 00:26:45,748
Mr. Johnson,
it's our duty to inform you...

288
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:49,628
that you are entitled to recast
your ballot in a timely manner.

289
00:26:50,264 --> 00:26:52,289
What if I don't want to?

290
00:26:53,768 --> 00:26:54,393
Bud!

291
00:26:56,604 --> 00:27:01,166
Alright then, how about if I, how
about if I just whisper it to you then?

292
00:27:01,175 --> 00:27:03,643
Right here we'd get it over with,
right now and you can listen too!

293
00:27:03,711 --> 00:27:06,043
No, sir, there are strict rules
and legal procedures.

294
00:27:06,114 --> 00:27:10,073
Legal shit. Shit, fellas,
I can't afford a lawyer.

295
00:27:10,384 --> 00:27:13,114
You're not in trouble.
You don't need a lawyer.

296
00:27:13,521 --> 00:27:15,819
However,
I will have to administer an oath.

297
00:27:16,057 --> 00:27:16,955
An oath?

298
00:27:17,024 --> 00:27:18,787
An oath. Please,
place your hand on the Bible.

299
00:27:21,429 --> 00:27:23,397
Do you, Earnest Johnson...

300
00:27:23,731 --> 00:27:26,859
swear to recast your ballot
in the spirit of the law?

301
00:27:27,435 --> 00:27:29,198
Yeah, yes, sure. Okay.

302
00:27:29,804 --> 00:27:30,532
So noted.

303
00:27:30,605 --> 00:27:34,200
A petition will be filed on your behalf
and a date will be set for your revote.

304
00:27:34,375 --> 00:27:39,005
Does this put me
on some sort of fast track list?

305
00:27:40,381 --> 00:27:42,645
You know, for like jury duty?

306
00:27:43,684 --> 00:27:47,745
Considering the gravity of this
situation, keep all of this a secret.

307
00:27:49,223 --> 00:27:50,053
Have a good night.

308
00:28:06,407 --> 00:28:07,101
<i>Sorry.</i>

309
00:28:08,075 --> 00:28:12,034
You should be! I could get into
all kinds of trouble because of you!

310
00:28:13,681 --> 00:28:14,841
Gosh, Molly!

311
00:28:14,849 --> 00:28:18,910
Why can't you
learn just to let things be?

312
00:28:19,253 --> 00:28:23,747
I told you this was important to me,
but you never listen!

313
00:28:33,668 --> 00:28:37,388
<i>Another astonishing development:</i>
<i>New Mexico Elections Bureau is reporting...</i>

314
00:28:37,405 --> 00:28:41,501
<i>a single irregular ballot is holding</i>
<i>up a final decision in the state.</i>

315
00:28:41,609 --> 00:28:45,272
<i>As I said, a single ballot.</i>
<i>That's one vote, folks!</i>

316
00:28:45,446 --> 00:28:48,734
<i>This really couldn't get any stranger,</i>
<i>MSNBC has learned that the voter...</i>

317
00:28:48,749 --> 00:28:51,274
<i>has been identified and has</i>
<i>agreed to recast the ballot.</i>

318
00:28:51,786 --> 00:28:55,779
<i>One voter will decide the fate</i>
<i>of the state's five electoral votes.</i>

319
00:28:55,923 --> 00:29:00,815
<i>On this bizarre day, no one</i>
<i>will soon forget, one American citizen...</i>

320
00:29:00,828 --> 00:29:04,787
<i>will effectively choose the next</i>
<i>President of the United States.</i>

321
00:29:06,033 --> 00:29:08,866
Apparently the electronic
voting machine malfunctioned.

322
00:29:08,936 --> 00:29:11,655
The ballot was scanned, but the machine
died before the vote was counted.

323
00:29:11,672 --> 00:29:12,559
It's an anomaly.

324
00:29:12,573 --> 00:29:14,973
No shit, Larry! What polling
station was the machine in?

325
00:29:15,042 --> 00:29:17,010
Texico, New Mexico, sir.

326
00:29:17,812 --> 00:29:18,938
Is that a place?

327
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:21,839
Where the hell is Texico?

328
00:29:21,916 --> 00:29:23,679
New Mexico, sir, Curry County.

329
00:29:23,751 --> 00:29:27,016
New Mexico election law dictates
if a voter's right is violated...

330
00:29:27,088 --> 00:29:30,182
The voter shall be-entitled
to recast the ballot. I know.

331
00:29:31,392 --> 00:29:34,850
Alright, kids,
we're going to war.

332
00:29:34,962 --> 00:29:37,123
A map!
Somebody get me a map!

333
00:29:37,365 --> 00:29:41,461
There's one schmuck standing between us
and the White House. Find out who it is.

334
00:29:41,769 --> 00:29:43,202
We can't do that legally.

335
00:29:44,672 --> 00:29:45,570
Just find him.

336
00:29:51,379 --> 00:29:54,314
We were supposed
to my cytoplasm out of Jell-O today.

337
00:29:56,017 --> 00:29:58,770
What kinda kid would rather
sit in a crummy classroom...

338
00:29:58,786 --> 00:30:00,151
than be out here?

339
00:30:00,655 --> 00:30:04,113
What kind of father goes fishing
when he should be looking for a new job?

340
00:30:04,458 --> 00:30:07,018
The kind who would just like...

341
00:30:07,028 --> 00:30:10,964
to spend a little more time
with his daughter.

342
00:30:12,066 --> 00:30:12,828
That's who.

343
00:30:13,868 --> 00:30:15,597
- Fine.
- Fine.

344
00:30:18,906 --> 00:30:19,998
Anyway, I've been thinking.

345
00:30:20,508 --> 00:30:21,770
How refreshing!

346
00:30:23,778 --> 00:30:27,942
Jesus! You gotta quit being
such a smart ass all the time?

347
00:30:28,015 --> 00:30:30,984
And you've got to stop using Jesus
as a cuss word all the time!

348
00:30:31,419 --> 00:30:33,239
He's a billion people's Savior.

349
00:30:33,254 --> 00:30:35,347
Alright, fine, okay?
I get it.

350
00:30:36,424 --> 00:30:37,857
- Fine.
- Fine.

351
00:30:45,132 --> 00:30:48,420
I wish...
your mom could be here...

352
00:30:48,436 --> 00:30:50,996
to talk to you about
everything that's going on.

353
00:30:53,874 --> 00:30:55,239
I really do.

354
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:59,907
No, she... no, she can't.

355
00:31:02,116 --> 00:31:03,105
She's just, she can't, baby.

356
00:31:07,855 --> 00:31:08,321
Bud.

357
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:15,220
Next Tuesday, is bring
your father to school day.

358
00:31:17,498 --> 00:31:20,023
- So?
- I want you to come.

359
00:31:23,437 --> 00:31:26,133
It's not gonna embarrass
you that I don't have a job?

360
00:31:26,607 --> 00:31:27,767
I don't care.

361
00:31:28,642 --> 00:31:29,870
I want you to come anyway.

362
00:31:35,683 --> 00:31:37,708
- Think you can remember?
- Of course.

363
00:31:39,553 --> 00:31:40,178
How?

364
00:31:40,955 --> 00:31:41,922
Well...

365
00:31:43,891 --> 00:31:45,449
I'll write it on my forehead.

366
00:31:55,236 --> 00:31:56,635
Can I go to school, now?

367
00:32:00,608 --> 00:32:03,509
Yes. Just one more cast.

368
00:32:14,488 --> 00:32:15,682
Why don't you go
start the truck.

369
00:32:31,105 --> 00:32:35,474
Try to get a two shot, alright?
Okay, come on!

370
00:32:35,776 --> 00:32:36,765
Earnest Johnson!

371
00:32:37,478 --> 00:32:39,309
- Yes?
- Kate Madison.

372
00:32:40,114 --> 00:32:41,206
- Hi, there.
- Hi.

373
00:32:43,918 --> 00:32:46,352
Shit! You're the lady
from the news.

374
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:48,718
I am, and I'd like
to ask you a few questions.

375
00:32:48,789 --> 00:32:51,155
You know, you're much prettier
than you are on the TV.

376
00:32:51,592 --> 00:32:52,479
Thanks. I would...

377
00:32:52,493 --> 00:32:56,122
Don't get me wrong,
you're pretty on the TV too.

378
00:32:57,331 --> 00:32:59,663
Just, we got an old set
that kinda "squirshes" you.

379
00:32:59,834 --> 00:33:00,630
Squishes everybody.

380
00:33:01,168 --> 00:33:03,193
I believe, Mr. Johnson.
I believe...

381
00:33:03,204 --> 00:33:04,831
You can call me Bud.

382
00:33:05,272 --> 00:33:08,730
Bud. I was hoping you
could tell me why those men...

383
00:33:08,742 --> 00:33:11,233
flew from Santa Fe,
to see you in the middle of the night.

384
00:33:18,786 --> 00:33:22,813
Well, actually, I kinda promised
to keep that a secret.

385
00:33:23,891 --> 00:33:26,416
You mean,
you're going to recast your vote.

386
00:33:28,329 --> 00:33:31,765
Well, shit, I guess that I guess
it ain't that much of a secret then.

387
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:36,161
Now, listen, Bud,
you need to watch your language.

388
00:33:36,337 --> 00:33:37,463
- We're taping this for TV, okay?
- The language?

389
00:33:38,138 --> 00:33:41,107
Goddamnit, yes of course!

390
00:33:41,242 --> 00:33:46,646
The question now is, who you voted for
and are you going to vote the same way?

391
00:33:48,916 --> 00:33:50,747
Remind me again who's running?

392
00:33:51,685 --> 00:33:54,677
What you're saying is,
you're keeping an open mind?

393
00:33:55,689 --> 00:33:57,554
Yeah, that's...

394
00:33:58,058 --> 00:33:59,355
That's the kinda guy I am.

395
00:34:00,261 --> 00:34:01,250
You gotta be kidding me!

396
00:34:01,929 --> 00:34:03,954
This is OJ big. Bigger!

397
00:34:05,799 --> 00:34:06,823
I gotta call network!

398
00:34:08,202 --> 00:34:11,797
John,
let me break the story.

399
00:34:11,805 --> 00:34:13,534
I thought I was gonna die
in this shithole.

400
00:34:13,674 --> 00:34:16,268
You said that when the time was right,
you'd give me a chance. That's the time!

401
00:34:16,343 --> 00:34:17,503
We'll be back to a real market.

402
00:34:17,645 --> 00:34:21,467
The city! With elevators and Chinese
restaurants and crime and traffic.

403
00:34:21,482 --> 00:34:24,371
I got the tape
of Mrs. Zachary's prize winning sow.

404
00:34:24,385 --> 00:34:26,319
Screw Mrs. Zachary.
And screw the sow!

405
00:34:26,453 --> 00:34:27,477
You promised me.

406
00:34:28,322 --> 00:34:30,813
Get network on the phone.
Don't screw it up.

407
00:34:32,526 --> 00:34:34,619
- You won't regret it!
- Better not! Darlene!

408
00:34:46,073 --> 00:34:50,066
So... is your dad coming
to talk to our class?

409
00:34:51,812 --> 00:34:56,806
I don't know. Doesn't really leave
the house much since my mom left.

410
00:34:58,419 --> 00:34:59,477
Mine left too.

411
00:35:00,354 --> 00:35:03,323
She's pursuing
a singing career in Albuquerque.

412
00:35:05,025 --> 00:35:07,357
I'm going to move there
when she becomes a big star.

413
00:35:07,428 --> 00:35:09,225
And she's gonna take me
on tour and everything.

414
00:35:11,065 --> 00:35:12,862
She'll probably do
a concert in Austin.

415
00:35:14,401 --> 00:35:15,925
I could get you free tickets.

416
00:35:16,503 --> 00:35:19,063
Maybe.
Guess I could borrow my dad's car.

417
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,869
I'll wait till he gets drunk.
Sometimes he passes out.

418
00:35:29,516 --> 00:35:31,074
Do you think
I could try your skateboard?

419
00:35:34,655 --> 00:35:35,314
Okay.

420
00:35:42,429 --> 00:35:46,832
I'm the king of Curry County, John,
and I've been 15 years at this desk.

421
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:50,097
I feel for you, Ted.
Don't make me call security.

422
00:35:59,313 --> 00:36:01,178
Holy crap!

423
00:36:02,149 --> 00:36:04,447
You, desk! Sit!

424
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:07,087
People,
we go live in 30 seconds!

425
00:36:07,221 --> 00:36:09,121
From this point on,
the news counts!

426
00:36:09,189 --> 00:36:13,558
So excited,
I got my accent back. My god!

427
00:36:15,629 --> 00:36:16,596
And cue graphics!

428
00:36:17,564 --> 00:36:18,428
And cue music!

429
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,798
And cue!

430
00:36:22,236 --> 00:36:27,606
Good evening. This is Madison, coming
to you from Curry County, New Mexico.

431
00:36:27,775 --> 00:36:31,211
Over the last 24 hours,
the American political process...

432
00:36:31,278 --> 00:36:35,078
<i>has ground to a virtual standstill</i>
<i>as the world watches...</i>

433
00:36:35,315 --> 00:36:40,150
<i>waiting for the outcome of an election.</i>
<i>Today, I uncovered the identity...</i>

434
00:36:40,254 --> 00:36:43,052
<i>of the person the entire</i>
<i>world has been looking for.</i>

435
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:46,691
<i>The one swing voter</i>
<i>who will decide the election.</i>

436
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:50,452
<i>Those of you hoping to hear that</i>
<i>decision will be sorely disappointed.</i>

437
00:36:50,664 --> 00:36:53,895
<i>Because you are about to meet</i>
<i>a registered independent...</i>

438
00:36:54,034 --> 00:36:56,832
<i>who claims to be</i>
<i>keeping an open mind.</i>

439
00:36:57,604 --> 00:37:00,300
<i>Imagine,</i>
<i>on this man's shoulders...</i>

440
00:37:00,541 --> 00:37:03,442
<i>stands the future</i>
<i>of the free world.</i>

441
00:37:03,811 --> 00:37:05,244
Just the kind of guy I am.

442
00:37:07,147 --> 00:37:11,447
Let it never again be said,
that a single vote counts for nothing.

443
00:37:21,462 --> 00:37:21,985
Bud!

444
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:23,319
Bud!

445
00:37:24,465 --> 00:37:25,090
What?

446
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,624
There's some people outside.

447
00:37:28,102 --> 00:37:32,198
Geez, you gotta stop
waking me up like this, okay?

448
00:37:32,706 --> 00:37:33,934
You're gonna kill me.

449
00:37:34,007 --> 00:37:36,305
There are some people outside!

450
00:37:37,778 --> 00:37:38,506
People?

451
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,544
God!

452
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:45,218
No, not there! Out front!

453
00:37:45,953 --> 00:37:49,514
Oh, God... What now?

454
00:37:51,725 --> 00:37:53,920
- Dad, hurry up!
- Yeah, I'm going, honey.

455
00:37:56,930 --> 00:37:58,420
There's a lot of people
out there.

456
00:37:58,732 --> 00:38:02,293
Okay, honey, let's see
what the fuss is all about.

457
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:07,668
<i>Is that him?</i>

458
00:38:08,776 --> 00:38:09,470
Bud!

459
00:38:10,544 --> 00:38:12,034
Mr. Johnson,
any decisions yet?

460
00:38:24,992 --> 00:38:27,517
- Holy shit!
- What do they want?

461
00:38:29,229 --> 00:38:30,161
I don't know.

462
00:38:34,268 --> 00:38:35,360
Go turn the TV on, baby.

463
00:38:44,311 --> 00:38:47,474
<i>We are in the midst</i>
<i>of a historic moment.</i>

464
00:38:47,614 --> 00:38:50,082
<i>The swing voter</i>
<i>has finally been identified.</i>

465
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:53,481
<i>We go live now to a trailer</i>
<i>in Texico, New Mexico.</i>

466
00:38:53,887 --> 00:38:56,617
<i>Earnest Johnson made</i>
<i>an appearance just moments ago.</i>

467
00:38:56,924 --> 00:38:59,484
<i>Apparently, overwhelmed</i>
<i>by the media presence.</i>

468
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:03,687
<i>And Mr. Landry, exactly how long</i>
<i>have you known Earnest Johnson?</i>

469
00:39:04,331 --> 00:39:07,232
<i>Earnest Johnson?</i>
<i>Hey, Earnest!</i>

470
00:39:08,268 --> 00:39:11,704
- <i>You mean Bud?</i>
- <i>We all grew up together.</i>

471
00:39:12,139 --> 00:39:14,198
<i>How do you think he's</i>
<i>shouldering the responsibility...</i>

472
00:39:14,208 --> 00:39:16,676
<i>of picking the next President</i>
<i>of the United States?</i>

473
00:39:18,812 --> 00:39:21,713
<i>Well, I'm sure that...</i>

474
00:39:22,583 --> 00:39:26,349
<i>Earnest is...</i>
<i>crapping his pants.</i>

475
00:39:29,256 --> 00:39:31,975
<i>He's a good guy.</i>
<i>He likes to treat them good.</i>

476
00:39:31,992 --> 00:39:34,017
<i>We used to light</i>
<i>the mesa back here on fire!</i>

477
00:39:40,968 --> 00:39:42,265
It's all my fault, isn't it?

478
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:44,566
No! No, no, no, baby, no.

479
00:39:45,138 --> 00:39:49,040
None of this would have happened
if I hadn't let you down.

480
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:51,470
What are we gonna do?

481
00:39:52,379 --> 00:39:53,038
Well...

482
00:39:56,383 --> 00:39:57,714
I'm gonna back these people up.

483
00:40:04,191 --> 00:40:06,216
Holy shit!

484
00:40:07,828 --> 00:40:08,852
There's so many!

485
00:40:10,764 --> 00:40:13,858
Ok, I'm just gonna go out there,
right? I'm gonna...

486
00:40:15,702 --> 00:40:19,866
I'm gonna walk out there and tell
those people it wasn't me who voted.

487
00:40:20,474 --> 00:40:21,736
No, you can't!

488
00:40:22,109 --> 00:40:23,076
Why not?

489
00:40:23,443 --> 00:40:25,638
You swore to that judge,
on a Bible and everything.

490
00:40:25,712 --> 00:40:27,942
What? That was the middle
of the night. That can't count!

491
00:40:29,449 --> 00:40:32,748
You were under oath, Bud.
Voter fraud is a felony.

492
00:40:32,853 --> 00:40:35,287
And one more felony
and they take me away from you.

493
00:40:35,422 --> 00:40:37,413
You're right. Shit!
I am down to one!

494
00:40:49,369 --> 00:40:50,336
What do we do?

495
00:40:55,842 --> 00:40:59,175
We lie. We have to.

496
00:41:01,982 --> 00:41:07,648
Okay, that's a good plan.
Just a little white lie is all this is.

497
00:41:07,721 --> 00:41:09,951
- Between us.
- Just between us.

498
00:41:10,557 --> 00:41:13,685
Who knows,
maybe this thing, all these...

499
00:41:14,895 --> 00:41:18,854
Maybe all these people,
they just go away.

500
00:41:55,936 --> 00:41:57,301
Stop! Stop!

501
00:42:39,446 --> 00:42:40,708
What the hell is this?

502
00:42:41,181 --> 00:42:42,614
The biggest space we could find.

503
00:42:44,918 --> 00:42:47,944
How we gonna do this?
Build a campaign around one man?

504
00:42:47,954 --> 00:42:50,354
- I don't know how to do this.
- You're gonna leave it to me.

505
00:42:50,524 --> 00:42:53,288
We're gonna win him, Don!
We're gonna win this guy.

506
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:55,744
We got the issues on our side!

507
00:42:55,762 --> 00:42:57,514
- There you go!
- He's gonna love me!

508
00:42:57,531 --> 00:42:58,725
What's not to love?

509
00:43:02,803 --> 00:43:06,933
We're in trouble. I need you to dig up
everything you can on Earnest Johnson.

510
00:43:07,007 --> 00:43:08,463
Talk to his family, his friends.

511
00:43:08,475 --> 00:43:10,773
I want to know what he reads,
what television show he watches.

512
00:43:10,844 --> 00:43:15,304
His hobbies, his favorite foods,
his hopes, his dreams, everything.

513
00:43:15,849 --> 00:43:20,183
All we have to do is win
over one American mind!

514
00:43:20,887 --> 00:43:21,979
You know, I was just thinking,
Marty.

515
00:43:22,756 --> 00:43:24,883
I'd like to get to know
this Bud Johnson. Personally.

516
00:43:25,158 --> 00:43:26,125
Okay. Good.

517
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,427
Maybe take him out
for some ice cream.

518
00:43:32,299 --> 00:43:32,958
Ice cream?

519
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:35,561
What grown man
doesn't like ice cream?

520
00:43:39,372 --> 00:43:42,705
No higher education,
not much lower education.

521
00:43:43,009 --> 00:43:45,170
Divorced single father,
recently laid off.

522
00:43:45,245 --> 00:43:46,337
What's our first step?

523
00:43:46,513 --> 00:43:49,641
Put you in a room together. See if you
persuade him to come over to our side.

524
00:43:49,850 --> 00:43:55,686
I like it. Him and me in a room. Yes,
talking ideas, seeing what comes up.

525
00:43:55,789 --> 00:43:57,711
Great plan.
I'll get you some talking points.

526
00:43:57,724 --> 00:43:59,282
I'm good off the cuff already.

527
00:43:59,459 --> 00:44:04,283
Of course! We're just gonna get
an itty bitty think tank together.

528
00:44:04,297 --> 00:44:08,063
We'll run the data, see what you two
could possibly have in common.

529
00:44:08,869 --> 00:44:10,302
Your petition has been processed.

530
00:44:10,537 --> 00:44:14,997
And in accordance with New Mexico state
law, Chapter 1, Article 13, Section 11.

531
00:44:15,008 --> 00:44:19,297
Could you do us a favor and back
these news people up a little bit?

532
00:44:19,312 --> 00:44:22,304
We could barely
sleep last night.

533
00:44:26,386 --> 00:44:29,412
said voter Earnest Johnson,
is hereby authorized...

534
00:44:29,422 --> 00:44:31,413
to recast his vote 10 days
from today along official.

535
00:44:32,392 --> 00:44:35,020
And there's a fat guy there,
he keeps leaning on my truck...

536
00:44:35,028 --> 00:44:37,087
fixing his hair
in my side mirror.

537
00:44:42,502 --> 00:44:46,256
Said voter, Earnest Johnson,
is hereby authorized to recast his vote...

538
00:44:46,273 --> 00:44:49,731
10 days from today. Along official
documentary notification...

539
00:44:49,743 --> 00:44:51,836
to both state,
federal regulatory authorities.

540
00:44:52,345 --> 00:44:55,041
Bud, life's gonna be
a little different from now on.

541
00:44:55,482 --> 00:44:57,347
You'll need security
around the clock.

542
00:44:57,951 --> 00:44:58,576
For what?

543
00:44:59,019 --> 00:45:00,816
You're a household name.

544
00:45:01,154 --> 00:45:04,180
Every political nut job in the country
is gonna make their way down here.

545
00:45:04,324 --> 00:45:08,784
In 10 days, you gonna make the most
important decision in the free world.

546
00:45:08,862 --> 00:45:11,751
And it is our job to make sure
this thing comes off fair and square.

547
00:45:11,765 --> 00:45:14,734
So, if there's anything
that you think we need to know...

548
00:45:19,072 --> 00:45:19,834
Like what?

549
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:22,605
Something
we may find out later.

550
00:45:23,743 --> 00:45:25,370
Better now, than later.

551
00:45:29,482 --> 00:45:32,542
No, sir,
there's nothing to know.

552
00:45:36,690 --> 00:45:39,250
Molly! Molly! Molly!

553
00:45:39,693 --> 00:45:42,526
- I don't believe it. She's his daughter!
- Who's his daughter?

554
00:45:42,596 --> 00:45:45,224
The Chairman of the Fed,
the girl that won the essay contest.

555
00:45:45,232 --> 00:45:47,359
Remember, I ran the story on her,
election day?

556
00:45:47,834 --> 00:45:50,769
This is perfect! The network wants
to do an interview with her daddy.

557
00:45:51,004 --> 00:45:52,926
I'm not going
to use this little girl!

558
00:45:52,939 --> 00:45:55,464
I've told you this before.
I have integrity, like Paula Zahn.

559
00:45:55,542 --> 00:45:57,294
I met Paula Zahn.

560
00:45:57,310 --> 00:46:00,006
Paula Zahn eats
where my friend is a waiter, alright?

561
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:02,640
I don't want to hurt
your feelings, you're no Paula Zahn.

562
00:46:02,716 --> 00:46:03,774
No Paula Zahn?

563
00:46:03,883 --> 00:46:06,374
I booked this story.
It was me.

564
00:46:06,386 --> 00:46:10,516
Yes, that's why everybody here
is trying to rip it out from under you.

565
00:46:10,790 --> 00:46:14,282
You want a desk in New York,
you want a desk in Los Angeles?

566
00:46:14,394 --> 00:46:16,828
Forget everything you learned
in journalism school.

567
00:46:16,997 --> 00:46:21,900
This isn't new anymore. This isn't life.
This is bigger. This is television!

568
00:46:53,533 --> 00:46:56,388
<i>The Johnsons have been virtually</i>
<i>besieged inside their trailer.</i>

569
00:46:56,403 --> 00:46:59,304
<i>but we're lucky to be joined</i>
<i>by their pizza delivery man.</i>

570
00:46:59,472 --> 00:47:02,339
<i>How would you characterize</i>
<i>Earnest Johnson's state of mind?</i>

571
00:47:03,243 --> 00:47:05,507
<i>Mostly I'd say, he was hungry.</i>

572
00:47:05,612 --> 00:47:06,738
<i>He was hungry.</i>

573
00:47:07,714 --> 00:47:08,874
<i>Well, there you have it.</i>

574
00:47:08,882 --> 00:47:10,247
I ain't tipping him anymore.

575
00:47:10,517 --> 00:47:13,179
I ought to trim
Mrs. Hardy's elm.

576
00:47:13,887 --> 00:47:17,846
Looks like it's moving in our roof.
What do you think?

577
00:47:18,725 --> 00:47:21,285
Hard to tell.
What do you think?

578
00:47:22,762 --> 00:47:23,524
Definitely.

579
00:47:25,231 --> 00:47:27,893
<i>Since has become the most Googled</i>
<i>town in the world...</i>

580
00:47:28,134 --> 00:47:30,728
<i>narrowly edging out in Jihad.</i>

581
00:48:01,601 --> 00:48:02,829
Holy crap!

582
00:48:03,269 --> 00:48:04,531
- You Bud?
- Yeah!

583
00:48:04,671 --> 00:48:06,571
You're Richard Petty.

584
00:48:06,873 --> 00:48:07,669
You got it, man.

585
00:48:08,108 --> 00:48:10,406
Hold on. Honey!
It's the king!

586
00:48:10,710 --> 00:48:14,373
I got a friend down the road I want
you to meet. You wanna go for a ride?

587
00:48:17,684 --> 00:48:21,313
Yes!
could my daughter come?

588
00:48:21,488 --> 00:48:24,821
In that case, maybe you'd better
drive. Precious cargo and all!

589
00:48:30,397 --> 00:48:33,093
Just a minute, Mr. Petty.
Hey, Chubby!

590
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:37,397
Just because it ain't rolling, don't
make it furniture! Back out of here!

591
00:48:38,705 --> 00:48:40,036
Come on, baby! We gotta go!

592
00:48:41,107 --> 00:48:42,369
You're Richard Petty!

593
00:48:50,950 --> 00:48:53,077
Molly! Get a picture, honey.

594
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:58,387
If you told me two days ago
that I'd be driving your Dodge...

595
00:48:58,658 --> 00:48:59,886
- Did you get it?
- Yes.

596
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:03,561
Get one more. Get it with my chin
out a little bit. Like that.

597
00:49:04,531 --> 00:49:05,429
Like a hero.

598
00:49:06,833 --> 00:49:08,164
I told you, you crazy!

599
00:49:08,468 --> 00:49:10,163
You ain't seen nothing yet.

600
00:49:38,431 --> 00:49:39,056
Bud!

601
00:49:40,233 --> 00:49:41,894
This is the President's plane.

602
00:49:44,471 --> 00:49:48,567
Hello, you be Molly. I'm Mr. Fox,
I work with the President.

603
00:49:48,975 --> 00:49:50,909
Hi.
Hi. Bud, Martin Fox.

604
00:49:51,711 --> 00:49:53,770
- Hello.
- How are you? Come in.

605
00:49:53,847 --> 00:49:55,576
Take your hat off please.
Your hat.

606
00:49:55,949 --> 00:49:58,315
So, this is the Johnson family.

607
00:49:58,885 --> 00:50:00,546
Welcome to Air Force One.
Hi, Molly.

608
00:50:00,753 --> 00:50:02,277
- Thanks for having us, sir.
- It's a pleasure.

609
00:50:02,489 --> 00:50:04,184
- Mr. President.
- Huh?

610
00:50:04,991 --> 00:50:06,049
Call him Mr. President.

611
00:50:08,094 --> 00:50:09,891
It's an honor, Mr. President.

612
00:50:10,063 --> 00:50:12,122
It's an honor to meet you, Bud.
May I call you Bud?

613
00:50:12,232 --> 00:50:14,291
Yes, Mr. President.

614
00:50:14,734 --> 00:50:15,632
Come on in, come on.

615
00:50:17,971 --> 00:50:18,699
God, this...

616
00:50:19,906 --> 00:50:22,704
This place
is it's really something!

617
00:50:24,577 --> 00:50:26,272
It's my little home in the sky.

618
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:30,746
It's kinda,
like a trailer with wings.

619
00:50:31,651 --> 00:50:32,845
Fine analogy, Bud.

620
00:50:33,319 --> 00:50:36,288
Molly, I saw your speech
on TV the other night.

621
00:50:36,489 --> 00:50:37,478
Very impressive!

622
00:50:39,125 --> 00:50:42,185
- Say thank you, baby.
- Thank you, Mr. President.

623
00:50:42,195 --> 00:50:44,026
- You must be a very proud father.
- Yes, sir.

624
00:50:45,765 --> 00:50:49,701
God, I'm sorry.
Mr. President.

625
00:50:51,237 --> 00:50:54,593
You can see why she's definitely
the brains of our operation.

626
00:50:54,607 --> 00:50:57,041
I know what you mean.
we all need a Molly.

627
00:50:57,477 --> 00:50:59,308
Marty here, is my Molly.

628
00:50:59,579 --> 00:51:03,936
That's right. Molly,
I bet a smart kid like you...

629
00:51:03,950 --> 00:51:05,645
would love to see the war room.

630
00:51:06,586 --> 00:51:07,644
No, thanks.

631
00:51:07,654 --> 00:51:11,351
Why don't we have a peek and then your
dad and the President can have a talk.

632
00:51:11,424 --> 00:51:14,393
Go on, Honey.
Daddy has to talk to the President.

633
00:51:17,797 --> 00:51:19,162
She's a firecracker!

634
00:51:19,232 --> 00:51:22,133
Yes, sir, she's the whole deal!

635
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:26,038
I wouldn't mind seeing
the war room, Mr. President.

636
00:51:26,739 --> 00:51:30,470
I'll show it to you later.
And please, call me Andy.

637
00:51:31,844 --> 00:51:32,776
- Andy?
- Yeah.

638
00:51:35,181 --> 00:51:37,809
Are you sure,
that-that other guy...

639
00:51:37,817 --> 00:51:40,377
I know, things can get
a little formal around here.

640
00:51:40,653 --> 00:51:43,121
Commander in Chief, running
the country and all that. Please.

641
00:51:43,623 --> 00:51:46,217
I am just an ordinary man,
like you...

642
00:51:46,593 --> 00:51:48,356
The kinda guy you can sit down
and have a beer with.

643
00:51:49,429 --> 00:51:50,760
Would you like a beer, Bud?

644
00:51:54,567 --> 00:51:55,158
A beer?

645
00:51:58,571 --> 00:51:59,265
No shit?

646
00:51:59,973 --> 00:52:00,735
No shit.

647
00:52:02,542 --> 00:52:03,531
Well, then...

648
00:52:04,877 --> 00:52:07,607
- Yes. Hell, yeah, Andy.
- Okay!

649
00:52:08,014 --> 00:52:09,948
David, would you get us
a couple of beers, please?

650
00:52:10,116 --> 00:52:12,243
- Thank you very much.
- So...

651
00:52:12,819 --> 00:52:15,652
you're gonna have some
story to tell your friends.

652
00:52:18,358 --> 00:52:22,556
I read about you in the paper.
They say you've never lost an election.

653
00:52:23,096 --> 00:52:26,623
That's right. You can learn
a lot from reading the newspaper.

654
00:52:27,433 --> 00:52:31,494
They also said that you don't
believe in anything anymore.

655
00:52:32,372 --> 00:52:34,203
Even if it meant
selling your mother's soul.

656
00:52:34,273 --> 00:52:37,868
No, see, no, see that's libelous,
Because my mother is a wonderful...

657
00:52:38,044 --> 00:52:41,172
wonderful, wonderful woman.

658
00:52:54,761 --> 00:52:56,524
If you met my mother,
you'd understand.

659
00:52:58,631 --> 00:52:59,825
You a football fan, Bud?

660
00:53:01,034 --> 00:53:04,561
Well, I'm an American, aren't I?

661
00:53:06,439 --> 00:53:08,464
I played a little in high school.

662
00:53:08,975 --> 00:53:10,306
Did you now? What position?

663
00:53:10,443 --> 00:53:11,432
I was quarterback.

664
00:53:11,878 --> 00:53:16,577
I always thought football was
a strategic game. A lot like diplomacy.

665
00:53:16,649 --> 00:53:20,301
You got your offense, your defense,
the President is like your quarterback...

666
00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:21,786
and the American voters...

667
00:53:22,588 --> 00:53:25,489
Well... they're like the coach.

668
00:53:27,427 --> 00:53:28,826
Never thought of it that way.

669
00:53:28,895 --> 00:53:30,487
Now the coach's job
is to make sure...

670
00:53:30,496 --> 00:53:34,557
that the right man has
the football at the critical time.

671
00:53:35,101 --> 00:53:37,069
I know exactly what you mean,
Andy.

672
00:53:37,970 --> 00:53:38,698
Do you?

673
00:53:41,541 --> 00:53:42,439
Maybe not.

674
00:53:46,245 --> 00:53:47,405
Bring in the football, please.

675
00:53:50,783 --> 00:53:51,249
Bud.

676
00:53:53,986 --> 00:53:55,044
You wanna hold the football?

677
00:53:56,756 --> 00:53:57,882
There's a football in there?

678
00:54:03,196 --> 00:54:05,221
That case holds
the launch codes...

679
00:54:05,765 --> 00:54:07,596
to America's nuclear arsenal.

680
00:54:09,068 --> 00:54:10,501
That's what
this election's all about.

681
00:54:11,771 --> 00:54:16,799
launch codes like...
missiles and shit?

682
00:54:16,876 --> 00:54:20,312
I want you to pretend
that America is a team...

683
00:54:21,247 --> 00:54:23,579
- and you're the coach.
- Okay.

684
00:54:23,649 --> 00:54:27,335
Let's say it's the 4th quarter. We've
got possession, but we're down by five.

685
00:54:27,353 --> 00:54:29,776
North Korea has us pinned
in our own fifteenth line...

686
00:54:29,789 --> 00:54:34,726
with one second on the dooms day clock.
What are you doing to do?

687
00:54:34,894 --> 00:54:39,957
Okay, you go long. The only thing
standing between victory and defeat...

688
00:54:40,466 --> 00:54:42,661
is a successful Hail Mary.
One play.

689
00:54:43,436 --> 00:54:44,994
Who are you
gonna give the ball to, Bud?

690
00:54:45,071 --> 00:54:48,393
Do you pin your hopes on some
liberal second string quarterback...

691
00:54:48,407 --> 00:54:51,638
who hasn't had five minutes
in the big show? Of course you don't.

692
00:54:53,713 --> 00:54:55,044
You do the smart thing.

693
00:54:55,681 --> 00:54:59,276
The only thing. You go
with your strongest arm, the man...

694
00:54:59,285 --> 00:55:01,219
who's carried you through the season,
who's never let you down.

695
00:55:07,393 --> 00:55:09,861
Bud, America's counting on you.

696
00:55:10,429 --> 00:55:14,058
Yes, sir.
I'm not gonna let them down.

697
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:15,464
But, here.

698
00:55:18,371 --> 00:55:20,839
Wouldn't want to drop
the old football.

699
00:55:21,707 --> 00:55:23,072
Blow up France or something.

700
00:55:24,477 --> 00:55:25,193
You couldn't.

701
00:55:25,211 --> 00:55:29,841
There's a whole bunch of secret
codes and these special little keys.

702
00:55:30,383 --> 00:55:31,042
Here's to you!

703
00:55:33,519 --> 00:55:36,750
Look at all... Look at all
this stuff they give us, Molly.

704
00:55:37,390 --> 00:55:40,826
They give us the same shampoo
that the President uses.

705
00:55:41,227 --> 00:55:42,194
Great.

706
00:55:47,834 --> 00:55:49,961
So, what did you guys talk about?

707
00:55:53,372 --> 00:55:55,533
- Stuff.
- What stuff?

708
00:55:55,808 --> 00:55:56,832
You know...

709
00:55:58,611 --> 00:55:59,703
grown up stuff.

710
00:56:00,046 --> 00:56:01,035
Like?

711
00:56:02,215 --> 00:56:03,375
Like...

712
00:56:07,954 --> 00:56:08,579
Bud!

713
00:56:10,389 --> 00:56:11,583
What stuff?

714
00:56:11,657 --> 00:56:14,785
Like grown up stuff.
You know, coaching. Football.

715
00:56:15,361 --> 00:56:17,124
Geothermal nuclear war.

716
00:56:19,699 --> 00:56:22,099
Andy's, a great... great guy.

717
00:56:22,168 --> 00:56:25,695
He's not Andy.
He's the President of the United States.

718
00:56:25,838 --> 00:56:26,998
And he just wants your vote.

719
00:56:27,773 --> 00:56:30,298
And gee, guess what?
He's gonna get it.

720
00:56:30,409 --> 00:56:32,036
It's not even yours to give!

721
00:56:33,679 --> 00:56:34,338
You're gonna...

722
00:56:37,250 --> 00:56:38,649
ruin everything.

723
00:56:39,886 --> 00:56:42,684
Andy, the President,
invited me to watch the game...

724
00:56:42,855 --> 00:56:44,482
- with him on Monday night.
- That's a bribe!

725
00:56:44,490 --> 00:56:46,515
That's not a bribe.

726
00:56:46,592 --> 00:56:47,718
- Is too.
- It is not.

727
00:56:47,793 --> 00:56:49,021
- Is too.
- It is not.

728
00:56:49,095 --> 00:56:51,461
- Is too!
- Is not! What it is, "too"?

729
00:56:52,832 --> 00:56:54,857
- What the hell do you know?
- More than you.

730
00:56:54,867 --> 00:56:55,959
- You do not.
- Do too.

731
00:56:55,968 --> 00:56:57,731
- You do not.
- Do too.

732
00:57:01,641 --> 00:57:03,233
- Fine.
- Fine.

733
00:57:09,382 --> 00:57:11,714
Did you smell
all the leather on that plane?

734
00:57:17,924 --> 00:57:20,518
<i>If I made you feel second best</i>

735
00:57:22,428 --> 00:57:24,726
<i>I'm sorry I was blind</i>

736
00:57:25,631 --> 00:57:27,531
No, baby, leave it, leave it.
That's Willie.

737
00:57:29,802 --> 00:57:32,327
<i>You were always on my mind</i>

738
00:57:36,108 --> 00:57:37,234
<i>Hi, I'm Willie Nelson.</i>

739
00:57:37,243 --> 00:57:40,371
<i>And when I'm not performing,</i>
<i>I'm usually getting involved.</i>

740
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:43,874
<i>Hey, Bud, if you're out there</i>
<i>and you're watching...</i>

741
00:57:44,283 --> 00:57:45,716
He's talking to us!

742
00:57:45,785 --> 00:57:49,642
<i>There's a special dinner,</i>
<i>especially for you in your honor...</i>

743
00:57:49,655 --> 00:57:55,321
<i>hosted by my good friend and</i>
<i>Presidential candidate Donald Greenleaf.</i>

744
00:57:55,561 --> 00:57:57,961
- <i>I'll see you here tonight.</i>
- I'll do it, Willie!

745
00:58:00,967 --> 00:58:02,832
This is really getting weird.

746
00:58:30,863 --> 00:58:32,387
Democrat or a Republican?

747
00:58:32,398 --> 00:58:35,834
I'm Art Crumb,
Donald Greenleaf's campaign manager.

748
00:58:36,102 --> 00:58:37,899
- Nice to meet you.
- Same here.

749
00:58:38,270 --> 00:58:43,207
You must be Molly. Quite an essay.
You have a future in politics one day.

750
00:58:43,542 --> 00:58:45,373
You might too. One day.

751
00:58:48,381 --> 00:58:49,109
Shall we go in?

752
00:58:52,018 --> 00:58:53,986
Not too hard to be nice,
come on.

753
00:58:54,787 --> 00:58:56,584
Party. Party!

754
00:58:57,490 --> 00:59:00,254
Right this way...
make yourselves at home.

755
00:59:02,929 --> 00:59:03,395
Hello.

756
00:59:03,864 --> 00:59:06,094
As you can see,
we've got a lovely buffet.

757
00:59:06,266 --> 00:59:07,597
Would you like a bud, Bud?

758
00:59:09,469 --> 00:59:10,094
Sure.

759
00:59:11,338 --> 00:59:15,434
Look at that.
You got chipped meat on toast.

760
00:59:16,276 --> 00:59:17,675
My momma used
to make that for me.

761
00:59:18,378 --> 00:59:20,096
- No kidding?
- Yes.

762
00:59:20,113 --> 00:59:21,808
There's all you can eat.

763
00:59:22,349 --> 00:59:23,373
It's all in your honor.

764
00:59:23,750 --> 00:59:26,344
And there's all the Willie Nelson
you can listen to.

765
00:59:26,620 --> 00:59:28,417
I understand
you're an aficionado.

766
00:59:28,622 --> 00:59:32,422
Yes, sir, I was in an all Willie
tribute band for about five years.

767
00:59:32,726 --> 00:59:34,250
Called ourselves
The Half Nelsons.

768
00:59:35,162 --> 00:59:36,220
Only his songs?

769
00:59:36,530 --> 00:59:39,363
No other request.
But you know, I got my own stuff.

770
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:42,830
So, why don't you guys
do one of your songs tonight?

771
00:59:45,272 --> 00:59:49,675
I would but my rhythm
section's incarcerated.

772
00:59:50,510 --> 00:59:52,000
We've pulled a few strings.

773
00:59:52,212 --> 00:59:55,067
- Hey, Bud! Bud!
- Hey, boys!

774
00:59:55,082 --> 00:59:55,912
Come on up!

775
00:59:56,950 --> 00:59:57,974
They paying us?

776
00:59:58,051 --> 01:00:01,646
You really did, you got them out.
Thank you. Pull strings.

777
01:00:01,888 --> 01:00:06,882
Bud! Buddy, Buddy!
Buddy, look at me!

778
01:00:07,494 --> 01:00:11,897
Damn, Hank, you look good.
Just like prom.

779
01:00:13,433 --> 01:00:19,303
Thank you. Thank you, amigo.
This is the best day of my life.

780
01:00:23,343 --> 01:00:26,005
There's someone very
special I'd like you to meet.

781
01:00:27,514 --> 01:00:29,277
Mr. Johnson!

782
01:00:34,688 --> 01:00:36,178
Donald Greenleaf.

783
01:00:36,389 --> 01:00:37,185
Too tight.

784
01:00:45,165 --> 01:00:47,463
Hell of a party you got here,
Mr. Greenleaf.

785
01:00:47,534 --> 01:00:51,368
Yes, sir. We democrats
are one hell of a party.

786
01:00:52,706 --> 01:00:53,798
Call me Don.

787
01:00:56,776 --> 01:00:57,743
Okay, Don.

788
01:00:59,346 --> 01:01:00,335
The stage awaits.

789
01:01:04,684 --> 01:01:06,015
Well, he said so, right?

790
01:01:33,346 --> 01:01:35,940
<i>Pontiac, Pontiac</i>

791
01:01:36,149 --> 01:01:39,050
<i>Out there in my backyard.</i>

792
01:01:39,152 --> 01:01:43,612
<i>I'm gonna fix it up, paint it red</i>
<i>gonna make that engine go</i>

793
01:01:48,395 --> 01:01:50,886
<i>Chevrolet, Chevrolet</i>

794
01:01:51,097 --> 01:01:53,691
<i>Chevy year that running</i>
<i>Past fly, this and that</i>

795
01:01:54,100 --> 01:01:59,402
<i>Gonna make that engine go</i>
<i>You ready?</i>

796
01:02:01,808 --> 01:02:06,268
<i>They're all in my backyard</i>
<i>Them old cars</i>

797
01:02:07,314 --> 01:02:09,498
<i>I love everyone of them</i>

798
01:02:09,516 --> 01:02:12,007
Molly?
You remember me?

799
01:02:13,253 --> 01:02:14,481
Hi, Ms. Madison.

800
01:02:15,989 --> 01:02:17,889
Don't worry,
I didn't bring a camera.

801
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:23,088
<i>I'm gonna get one running yet.</i>

802
01:02:25,098 --> 01:02:29,296
All this craziness.
I don't know how you're doing it.

803
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:37,532
If you ever want to talk,
you call me anytime, okay?

804
01:02:38,211 --> 01:02:41,078
I'm gonna give you my card.
There you go.

805
01:02:44,451 --> 01:02:46,442
You want an interview
with Bud, right?

806
01:02:47,921 --> 01:02:49,218
I'd like him to think about it.

807
01:02:53,426 --> 01:02:54,120
Okay.

808
01:02:54,694 --> 01:02:57,527
<i>I'll get one running yet</i>

809
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:02,925
<i>I'll get one running yet</i>

810
01:03:06,306 --> 01:03:08,638
<i>I'll get one running yet</i>

811
01:03:16,283 --> 01:03:19,252
<i>I'll get one running yet</i>

812
01:03:22,555 --> 01:03:24,853
<i>I'll get one running yet</i>

813
01:03:35,902 --> 01:03:37,529
Bud! You're the man!

814
01:03:41,975 --> 01:03:44,876
Well... I like you, Bud.

815
01:03:45,312 --> 01:03:48,679
You seem to be a real
genuine sort of guy.

816
01:03:48,748 --> 01:03:49,578
Thanks, Don.

817
01:03:49,849 --> 01:03:52,340
Tell me about yourself.
You got any hobbies?

818
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:54,051
Just...

819
01:03:55,588 --> 01:03:56,953
just fishing.

820
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:01,725
You're a fellow angler!

821
01:04:03,096 --> 01:04:04,495
What kind of rod do you use?

822
01:04:04,731 --> 01:04:09,395
Well, I use a six and a half foot
graphite Johnny Morris signature series.

823
01:04:10,437 --> 01:04:10,926
Heavy?

824
01:04:12,205 --> 01:04:13,069
Medium heavy.

825
01:04:13,940 --> 01:04:16,636
Bait catching reel,
twelve pound test.

826
01:04:18,511 --> 01:04:19,273
Don't tell me.

827
01:04:19,979 --> 01:04:23,608
Seven inch power grub,
purple shaky worm.

828
01:04:25,452 --> 01:04:29,411
Yes, sir! Damn, he, he,
you know your equipment!

829
01:04:29,622 --> 01:04:31,419
I figured you for a bass man.

830
01:04:31,658 --> 01:04:32,682
Well, I...

831
01:04:32,859 --> 01:04:35,259
try to take Molly out
as much as I can.

832
01:04:35,428 --> 01:04:38,192
We caught a two dinner stripe
on the Pecos just the other day.

833
01:04:39,132 --> 01:04:40,793
I'm sorry to hear that, Bud.

834
01:04:41,901 --> 01:04:42,560
Why?

835
01:04:42,869 --> 01:04:47,306
There's a bill in the House
targeting the Pecos River for...

836
01:04:48,308 --> 01:04:49,366
reallocation.

837
01:04:52,645 --> 01:04:53,873
You lost me there.

838
01:04:54,481 --> 01:04:56,881
That's where a big
corporation builds a dam.

839
01:04:57,317 --> 01:05:00,684
Limits the flow of water, the fish
can't get to their spawning grounds...

840
01:05:01,154 --> 01:05:03,520
eventually the whole
population dies off.

841
01:05:05,692 --> 01:05:10,254
That sucks, because I've been
fishing there my whole life.

842
01:05:10,597 --> 01:05:13,885
You'd better look for another river,
because President Boone has received...

843
01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:17,165
ten million dollars in contributions
from the energy company...

844
01:05:17,337 --> 01:05:19,669
and he's got to pay
them back somehow.

845
01:05:20,573 --> 01:05:25,067
Come on, now. Come on,
Andy wouldn't do that.

846
01:05:25,512 --> 01:05:28,447
He already did, Bud.
He already did.

847
01:05:30,717 --> 01:05:32,480
Okay. Can't you do something?

848
01:05:32,852 --> 01:05:34,319
If I'm elected President.

849
01:05:44,831 --> 01:05:45,320
What?

850
01:05:45,865 --> 01:05:48,299
No, tell me
exactly what was said.

851
01:05:50,170 --> 01:05:54,539
It's my commitment to protect
the wild places in this country...

852
01:05:54,908 --> 01:05:56,307
for future generations.

853
01:05:56,943 --> 01:05:58,740
And I'm not going
to stop there, Bud.

854
01:05:59,712 --> 01:06:02,306
With your help,
my administration...

855
01:06:02,515 --> 01:06:05,040
will be a leader
in environmental protections.

856
01:06:22,836 --> 01:06:24,064
My fellow Americans...

857
01:06:24,604 --> 01:06:29,735
I give you, the Pecos River
National Wildlife Preserve!

858
01:06:43,990 --> 01:06:47,687
And what can only be characterized
as a complete policy reversal...

859
01:06:47,794 --> 01:06:51,423
the President has surely
alienated his corporate donors...

860
01:06:51,498 --> 01:06:54,262
by adopting
a pro-environment stance.

861
01:06:54,667 --> 01:06:56,555
Bud and Molly Johnson
were on hand today...

862
01:06:56,569 --> 01:06:58,230
We are the environmental party!

863
01:06:59,572 --> 01:07:01,540
Those bastards
stole our platform.

864
01:07:02,342 --> 01:07:05,527
Put the PR people on standby.

865
01:07:05,545 --> 01:07:08,514
- You want Spiegelman Fischer?
- Too high brow.

866
01:07:08,815 --> 01:07:11,340
- What about those iPod guys?
- No, Larry, too urban.

867
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:15,613
Get the guys
who do those Miller Lite spots.

868
01:07:15,688 --> 01:07:17,883
The ones with those girls
wrestling in the fountain.

869
01:07:18,258 --> 01:07:19,520
I don't know, Mr. Crumb.

870
01:07:19,592 --> 01:07:22,117
I like the narrator's voice.
His cadence.

871
01:07:23,563 --> 01:07:24,359
Just call them.

872
01:07:24,697 --> 01:07:28,189
Galena hates those ads, Artie,
she says they send the wrong message.

873
01:07:28,201 --> 01:07:31,170
Your wife's not our target demographic,
that son of a bitch is.

874
01:07:33,873 --> 01:07:34,737
Great.

875
01:07:36,609 --> 01:07:38,702
He's got the Secret Service
running flight patterns!

876
01:07:45,151 --> 01:07:49,679
All we need is an issue
that matters to this guy.

877
01:07:49,923 --> 01:07:51,788
One issue, one man...

878
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:55,088
one vote.

879
01:07:59,399 --> 01:08:00,491
Boy.

880
01:08:05,538 --> 01:08:06,368
I already own it.

881
01:08:07,173 --> 01:08:09,573
Alright, I'm gonna buy a hotel.

882
01:08:16,783 --> 01:08:20,116
Hi, there.
I've got a delivery for Bud Johnson.

883
01:08:20,820 --> 01:08:21,445
From who?

884
01:08:23,156 --> 01:08:24,054
From everyone.

885
01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:49,771
<i>Tell me,</i>
<i>what drives Bud Johnson?</i>

886
01:08:52,952 --> 01:08:56,444
<i>Right now,</i>
<i>an '89 Chevy Silverado.</i>

887
01:08:57,991 --> 01:09:01,392
<i>You don't have to lift that up.</i>
<i>If you leave it, it's probably better.</i>

888
01:09:01,461 --> 01:09:04,385
- This thing is getting away from you.
- I'm doing the best I can.

889
01:09:04,397 --> 01:09:07,685
Do better! I thought you wanted
to get out of this shithole town!

890
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:09,167
I want to get out the facts!

891
01:09:11,804 --> 01:09:14,068
You hear that? The clicking.

892
01:09:14,641 --> 01:09:16,006
Click, click.

893
01:09:16,776 --> 01:09:20,712
The sound of a million remote controls
changing the channel on your ass.

894
01:09:20,913 --> 01:09:22,847
Click equals death!

895
01:09:23,249 --> 01:09:26,468
You got to get people a reason to watch.
This is the prime time news.

896
01:09:26,486 --> 01:09:28,579
The key word, being new!

897
01:09:29,455 --> 01:09:32,583
Find me something.
You just got taken down by Mary Hart!

898
01:09:33,459 --> 01:09:38,556
<i>Bud, in looking at it, is there</i>
<i>any issue in particular that...</i>

899
01:09:38,564 --> 01:09:40,122
has touched you personally?

900
01:09:41,501 --> 01:09:45,130
Yeah, yeah, insourcing.

901
01:09:45,638 --> 01:09:47,299
You mean, outsourcing.

902
01:09:47,473 --> 01:09:49,498
No, I mean in.

903
01:09:49,976 --> 01:09:52,001
- Can you elaborate?
- Yeah, well...

904
01:09:52,011 --> 01:09:56,072
where I used to work, there's a bunch
of guys I know, they got laid off.

905
01:09:57,016 --> 01:10:01,237
Instead of sending our jobs,
losing our jobs to Mexico...

906
01:10:01,254 --> 01:10:03,779
they're bringing
in Mexicans to take our jobs.

907
01:10:06,059 --> 01:10:07,253
And we're out.

908
01:10:07,927 --> 01:10:11,215
Wait a minute, could I say that again?
I don't think that came out right.

909
01:10:11,230 --> 01:10:12,492
That came out great.

910
01:10:13,566 --> 01:10:15,124
That came out very well,
Mr. Johnson.

911
01:10:16,402 --> 01:10:18,597
Very authentic.
Central casting?

912
01:10:19,038 --> 01:10:20,130
Border patrol?

913
01:10:22,041 --> 01:10:24,475
So, they're actual
undocumented workers?

914
01:10:25,178 --> 01:10:27,305
We prefer undocumented actors.

915
01:10:29,449 --> 01:10:31,883
Alright, rehearsal's up,
back it into one please!

916
01:10:37,790 --> 01:10:40,418
But we courted
the Pro-Immigrant movement.

917
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:44,621
Inclusiveness is the foundation
of our party. It's our base!

918
01:10:44,697 --> 01:10:48,155
We no longer have a base.
Bud Johnson's our base.

919
01:10:48,367 --> 01:10:50,665
I don't even recognize
myself anymore.

920
01:10:51,504 --> 01:10:53,495
And what about...
Rainbow House?

921
01:10:53,706 --> 01:10:56,971
Screw!
This guy cares about immigration.

922
01:10:57,343 --> 01:11:00,506
You wanna win? Go out there and rip
the Statue of Liberty a new one!

923
01:11:01,314 --> 01:11:02,645
And action!

924
01:11:03,282 --> 01:11:06,968
Bud, in the last four years,
President Boone...

925
01:11:06,986 --> 01:11:11,082
has allowed millions of illegal
aliens to cross the border...

926
01:11:11,157 --> 01:11:15,184
Flooding cities like Los Angeles,
New York and Texico.

927
01:11:15,328 --> 01:11:19,719
With your help, Bud, my administration
will mend our broken borders...

928
01:11:19,732 --> 01:11:21,666
and stop insourcing.

929
01:11:22,034 --> 01:11:25,003
A vote for Greenleaf
is a vote for America...

930
01:11:25,471 --> 01:11:28,599
An America
where Americans come first.

931
01:11:28,741 --> 01:11:32,802
<i>This land is our land, Bud.</i>
<i>Help me keep it that way.</i>

932
01:11:35,248 --> 01:11:39,048
<i>Dear Tommy, I was very moved</i>
<i>by the letter from your 6th grade class.</i>

933
01:11:39,485 --> 01:11:41,919
<i>Global warming</i>
<i>is a serious issue...</i>

934
01:11:42,121 --> 01:11:45,750
<i>and I promise to make it a top priority</i>
<i>in my discussions with the candidates.</i>

935
01:11:45,758 --> 01:11:48,522
<i>"Dear Mrs. Anderson,</i>
<i>thank you for your letter.</i>

936
01:11:48,795 --> 01:11:53,220
<i>I am doing everything I can to press</i>
<i>the candidates about health insurance."</i>

937
01:11:53,232 --> 01:11:56,690
<i>"Dear Mr. Olsen, I sympathize</i>
<i>with your fears about job security.</i>

938
01:11:56,769 --> 01:11:59,397
<i>I promise you,</i>
<i>I will not ignore the issues...</i>

939
01:11:59,472 --> 01:12:02,873
<i>Education, veterans,</i>
<i>the economy...</i>

940
01:12:03,276 --> 01:12:05,608
<i>health care, the environment.</i>

941
01:12:06,679 --> 01:12:10,615
<i>I am working tirelessly.</i>
<i>I'm doing everything I can.</i>

942
01:12:10,983 --> 01:12:14,851
<i>Sincerely,</i>
<i>Earnest Bud Johnson."</i>

943
01:12:45,351 --> 01:12:45,874
Now!

944
01:12:48,087 --> 01:12:48,576
Now!

945
01:12:49,622 --> 01:12:50,919
Oh, my God! Don!

946
01:12:51,290 --> 01:12:52,723
The goose is down!

947
01:12:54,460 --> 01:12:55,427
How many fingers?

948
01:12:57,096 --> 01:12:59,894
America wants to know
what it's like to be Bud Johnson.

949
01:13:01,334 --> 01:13:02,460
It doesn't suck.

950
01:13:02,902 --> 01:13:03,732
Come on!

951
01:13:03,903 --> 01:13:06,997
I've heard you've received
marriage proposals in the mail, true?

952
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:11,700
Yeah, you can tell
that Miss September...

953
01:13:12,545 --> 01:13:16,174
that
I'm weighing my options.

954
01:13:16,382 --> 01:13:17,679
Hurry up, Bud!

955
01:13:17,884 --> 01:13:20,751
People Magazine named you
the Sexiest Man of the Year.

956
01:13:21,087 --> 01:13:24,181
Yeah? Well, what can I say?

957
01:13:25,491 --> 01:13:26,822
Guilty as charged!

958
01:13:28,761 --> 01:13:29,489
These people!

959
01:13:29,562 --> 01:13:32,793
Molly, what do you think of your Dad?
What do you think?

960
01:13:43,910 --> 01:13:49,109
Go ahead, go on. Stick your head up
with that little camera. You turd!

961
01:13:52,218 --> 01:13:54,413
Bud... Bud!

962
01:13:54,820 --> 01:13:56,788
- Freeze!
- Stop.

963
01:13:57,723 --> 01:13:58,348
Stop.

964
01:14:00,092 --> 01:14:00,615
Stop!

965
01:14:02,061 --> 01:14:06,521
Come on, Molly? It's just chocolate.
From the gun people.

966
01:14:07,099 --> 01:14:09,124
- I fixed you bacon and eggs.
- You did?

967
01:14:09,835 --> 01:14:10,551
That's nice!

968
01:14:10,569 --> 01:14:13,595
- I want you to look nice.
- What's the occasion?

969
01:14:14,140 --> 01:14:15,869
There's someone
I think you should talk to.

970
01:14:16,409 --> 01:14:16,898
Sit.

971
01:14:18,444 --> 01:14:22,141
She's different than all the others.
I think her heart's in the right place.

972
01:14:22,448 --> 01:14:25,281
I want you to try not to say
anything embarrassing, okay?

973
01:14:26,419 --> 01:14:28,148
- To who?
- Ms. Madison.

974
01:14:29,989 --> 01:14:32,184
- The TV woman?
- She's outside.

975
01:14:33,092 --> 01:14:35,322
- She's outside?
- Yes. In the kitchen.

976
01:14:36,495 --> 01:14:38,360
- She's in our kitchen?
- Yes.

977
01:14:39,832 --> 01:14:41,766
Just try and be normal.

978
01:14:43,369 --> 01:14:44,358
Do I smell?

979
01:14:45,137 --> 01:14:50,200
Then, give me the Old Spice.
God darn it! I was just having some fun!

980
01:14:56,949 --> 01:14:58,678
Molly, these eggs are amazing.

981
01:14:59,618 --> 01:15:01,745
Yes, they sure are.

982
01:15:02,688 --> 01:15:03,347
Thanks.

983
01:15:08,627 --> 01:15:09,457
Well...

984
01:15:10,963 --> 01:15:13,158
I like this new look on you.

985
01:15:13,432 --> 01:15:16,196
It's good, isn't it?
Professional.

986
01:15:16,535 --> 01:15:19,402
Yeah, its damn good.

987
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:25,277
Anyway, Bud, I was thinking about
interviewing you over the next days.

988
01:15:25,745 --> 01:15:27,679
Get to know you
and your thoughts.

989
01:15:28,781 --> 01:15:32,080
Think people really care
about my thoughts?

990
01:15:32,184 --> 01:15:34,709
I really do considering
the choice you're about to make.

991
01:15:38,157 --> 01:15:39,613
Did you say
you went to Texico High?

992
01:15:39,625 --> 01:15:42,617
She did.
Only her name was Morales.

993
01:15:43,329 --> 01:15:44,125
Morales?

994
01:15:46,932 --> 01:15:52,768
You're kidding.
One of Bobby Morales little sisters?

995
01:15:52,838 --> 01:15:54,601
Yeah, that's me.

996
01:15:55,408 --> 01:15:56,670
Small world!

997
01:15:56,876 --> 01:16:00,312
Small town.
Then, Bud, are you ready?

998
01:16:01,213 --> 01:16:01,941
It's a good time?

999
01:16:03,282 --> 01:16:04,806
Yeah, go ahead, shoot.

1000
01:16:19,165 --> 01:16:19,893
Thanks, Bud.

1001
01:16:22,201 --> 01:16:25,068
Why don't we get started
with your opinion of gay marriage.

1002
01:16:25,137 --> 01:16:28,300
Shit! Do we have to?

1003
01:16:28,374 --> 01:16:31,741
- So, you're against it.
- I... no, I didn't say that.

1004
01:16:32,078 --> 01:16:33,705
Then, what is your position?

1005
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:38,517
I don't have a position on it. Actually,
I don't give a rat's ass about it.

1006
01:16:39,218 --> 01:16:42,984
My daddy always said whatever a king
does in his castle is his business.

1007
01:16:43,155 --> 01:16:47,216
I guess the same can go
for two queens.

1008
01:16:52,898 --> 01:16:56,959
I'm President Boone, and I'd like
you to meet a few friends of mine.

1009
01:16:57,603 --> 01:17:00,163
They're our doctors,
and our peace officers.

1010
01:17:00,606 --> 01:17:03,905
They teach our children,
they serve nobly in our armed forces.

1011
01:17:04,076 --> 01:17:06,260
For two long,
homosexual Americans...

1012
01:17:06,278 --> 01:17:08,303
have been persecuted
by the country they love.

1013
01:17:08,881 --> 01:17:14,114
This President, if re-elected,
will implement the open door initiative.

1014
01:17:14,620 --> 01:17:19,455
Gay Americans alike will be able
to proudly step out of the closet...

1015
01:17:19,592 --> 01:17:24,689
and on to the alter, to exchange the
sacred vows enjoyed by the rest of us.

1016
01:17:25,297 --> 01:17:29,688
Bud, With your help,
this Republican administration...

1017
01:17:29,702 --> 01:17:33,001
will say, I do.
To gay marriage.

1018
01:17:34,006 --> 01:17:34,870
I do.

1019
01:17:37,776 --> 01:17:38,470
I do.

1020
01:17:39,111 --> 01:17:40,043
I do!

1021
01:17:40,646 --> 01:17:41,738
I do.

1022
01:17:41,881 --> 01:17:42,813
I do!

1023
01:17:44,416 --> 01:17:45,610
I do!

1024
01:17:50,856 --> 01:17:53,188
- I did it!
- That 'a way, baby!

1025
01:17:54,793 --> 01:17:58,092
When we were kids, this was the only
thing to do on the weekends.

1026
01:18:00,032 --> 01:18:00,930
Still is.

1027
01:18:12,845 --> 01:18:14,039
Well done, Bud.

1028
01:18:14,947 --> 01:18:15,504
See?

1029
01:18:16,382 --> 01:18:17,940
Let's get to some real issues.

1030
01:18:19,718 --> 01:18:20,343
Okay.

1031
01:18:20,953 --> 01:18:24,616
Pro-life or pro-choice?
Where do you stand?

1032
01:18:26,725 --> 01:18:27,953
Well...

1033
01:18:30,029 --> 01:18:33,829
Life's pretty good.
Right about now.

1034
01:18:34,233 --> 01:18:35,530
So, you're pro-life then?

1035
01:18:39,071 --> 01:18:39,867
Who isn't?

1036
01:18:42,675 --> 01:18:43,198
Artie.

1037
01:18:46,345 --> 01:18:47,869
- Artie.
- What?

1038
01:18:48,714 --> 01:18:53,071
I don't feel comfortable with this.
We're headed in the wrong direction.

1039
01:18:53,085 --> 01:18:54,416
No, it's gonna be great.

1040
01:18:54,620 --> 01:18:56,417
- Artie.
- And action! Action!

1041
01:18:56,589 --> 01:18:57,954
And action, Donald!

1042
01:19:02,828 --> 01:19:04,022
What is our future?

1043
01:19:04,496 --> 01:19:06,589
I'll tell you what our future is.

1044
01:19:07,132 --> 01:19:10,351
Children like these,
like your daughter, Bud.

1045
01:19:10,369 --> 01:19:13,463
Happy, free, full of promise.

1046
01:19:14,540 --> 01:19:18,806
But imagine a world
without all this joyous laughter.

1047
01:19:19,578 --> 01:19:21,239
I'm talking about abortion.

1048
01:19:21,814 --> 01:19:24,840
President Boone,
he claims he's pro-life.

1049
01:19:24,850 --> 01:19:26,340
But yet under his leadership...

1050
01:19:26,352 --> 01:19:30,550
no significant challenge has been
leveled against Roe versus Wade.

1051
01:19:30,689 --> 01:19:33,544
With your help, Bud,
the Greenleaf administration...

1052
01:19:33,559 --> 01:19:38,462
will lead a genuine effort to reverse
this inhumane court decision.

1053
01:19:38,697 --> 01:19:43,293
So, join me and the Democrats
as we preserve all life...

1054
01:19:44,403 --> 01:19:47,930
That's for filling
God's intelligent design.

1055
01:19:48,407 --> 01:19:51,308
<i>I'm Donald Greenleaf</i>
<i>and I approve this message.</i>

1056
01:19:51,577 --> 01:19:53,340
That don't seem right.

1057
01:19:54,246 --> 01:19:57,044
He's only saying that because
you said you didn't like abortion.

1058
01:19:57,216 --> 01:19:59,081
Yeah, but I didn't say that.

1059
01:19:59,318 --> 01:20:01,218
You told that you were pro-life.

1060
01:20:02,788 --> 01:20:03,413
So what?

1061
01:20:03,489 --> 01:20:07,482
Pro-life means anti-abortion.
Roe versus Wade? Hello!

1062
01:20:08,193 --> 01:20:09,353
This isn't working.

1063
01:20:09,862 --> 01:20:12,660
I thought would help,
but it's just worse.

1064
01:20:12,731 --> 01:20:14,665
You're the one
that wanted me to talk to her.

1065
01:20:14,733 --> 01:20:17,861
I thought you might like her.
She's smart, and nice...

1066
01:20:18,003 --> 01:20:20,096
not like the other women
you spend time with.

1067
01:20:23,776 --> 01:20:25,471
Which women would those be, Molly?

1068
01:20:25,944 --> 01:20:27,639
The ones that dance, Bud.

1069
01:20:29,415 --> 01:20:31,246
Well, at least they got jobs.

1070
01:20:33,819 --> 01:20:35,719
It's all getting
turned upside down now.

1071
01:20:36,255 --> 01:20:38,883
What's all getting
turned upside down?

1072
01:20:39,958 --> 01:20:41,687
You're ruining America!

1073
01:20:42,428 --> 01:20:45,022
- I'm what?
- You're ruining EUA!

1074
01:20:45,097 --> 01:20:47,122
- I'm ruining EUA?
- Yes!

1075
01:20:47,132 --> 01:20:47,655
What?

1076
01:20:49,101 --> 01:20:52,889
What I finally am
is having a little good luck...

1077
01:20:52,905 --> 01:20:54,668
and you're giving me
shit about it!

1078
01:20:58,644 --> 01:21:00,737
You know what all this means
for someone like me?

1079
01:21:02,147 --> 01:21:04,809
I had dreams once.
Maybe it weren't this...

1080
01:21:04,817 --> 01:21:07,877
but I was in the fifth grade,
so I had them.

1081
01:21:09,254 --> 01:21:09,948
And now...

1082
01:21:12,257 --> 01:21:15,590
I pretty much been headed on a road
for being a nobody and now that...

1083
01:21:15,661 --> 01:21:19,893
I am a somebody, you can't stand
that I'm getting a little attention.

1084
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:23,197
- A little?
- Yeah, a little.

1085
01:21:24,470 --> 01:21:26,097
Maybe I'll tell the truth, Bud.

1086
01:21:26,939 --> 01:21:28,099
- The truth?
- Yes.

1087
01:21:29,875 --> 01:21:31,399
The truth about what?

1088
01:21:32,044 --> 01:21:35,810
Maybe I'll tell everybody it was me
who tried to vote while you got drunk!

1089
01:21:36,181 --> 01:21:38,445
I don't care if they
take me away from you.

1090
01:21:38,517 --> 01:21:40,109
Molly... Hey, Molly!

1091
01:21:42,388 --> 01:21:43,548
Leave me alone.

1092
01:21:49,995 --> 01:21:51,895
- Fine.
- <i>Fine.</i>

1093
01:21:54,433 --> 01:21:55,058
Fine.

1094
01:22:47,486 --> 01:22:48,384
Could you sign it?

1095
01:22:50,422 --> 01:22:51,582
Sure thing, Curly.

1096
01:22:54,693 --> 01:22:59,153
Hey, Bud... did you give
the President's butt a kiss from us?

1097
01:23:04,336 --> 01:23:05,564
You got something to say,
Walt?

1098
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:11,874
It's not just me, Bud. No one
likes what you done to this town.

1099
01:23:12,277 --> 01:23:14,177
What's gonna happen
after you vote?

1100
01:23:14,513 --> 01:23:18,415
Everyone's gonna pack up and leave us
in the same shape as they found us.

1101
01:23:18,584 --> 01:23:20,882
<i>Bud, you're on TV again!</i>

1102
01:23:23,589 --> 01:23:26,683
Hey, Bud, you're on TV again.

1103
01:23:26,692 --> 01:23:28,819
<i>People have to stop saying</i>
<i>Bud Johnson is good for democracy.</i>

1104
01:23:29,194 --> 01:23:32,186
<i>He's made us the laughing</i>
<i>stock of the entire world.</i>

1105
01:23:32,331 --> 01:23:35,983
<i>The news media follows him around</i>
<i>like a bunch of paparazzi, because...</i>

1106
01:23:36,001 --> 01:23:38,333
<i>we're more concerned</i>
<i>with his fifteen minutes of fame...</i>

1107
01:23:38,504 --> 01:23:40,768
<i>than we are with the choice</i>
<i>he's about to make.</i>

1108
01:23:41,373 --> 01:23:43,364
<i>Is anybody really</i>
<i>listening to this guy?</i>

1109
01:23:44,243 --> 01:23:48,179
<i>Wake up, America!</i>
<i>Bud Johnson, is a dumbass!</i>

1110
01:24:06,465 --> 01:24:08,660
Your wife has just arrived,
Mr. Greenleaf.

1111
01:24:08,734 --> 01:24:10,463
Thank God! Good.

1112
01:24:11,470 --> 01:24:13,131
Please, don't upset him.

1113
01:24:13,672 --> 01:24:16,402
When did you get in?
I missed you so much!

1114
01:24:18,644 --> 01:24:20,942
You are letting this two
bit hack destroy you.

1115
01:24:21,613 --> 01:24:24,901
You are everything that
the Republicans accused you of being.

1116
01:24:24,917 --> 01:24:27,886
A spineless amateur.
Afraid to take a position.

1117
01:24:27,953 --> 01:24:30,012
I am not afraid
to take a position.

1118
01:24:31,456 --> 01:24:33,686
Okay, sometimes
I have second thoughts.

1119
01:24:33,959 --> 01:24:35,950
But what thinking person doesn't?

1120
01:24:36,061 --> 01:24:39,929
You used to stand for something.
Both of you.

1121
01:24:40,666 --> 01:24:41,462
Let her go.

1122
01:24:42,334 --> 01:24:44,029
What's happened to you, Art?

1123
01:24:44,536 --> 01:24:45,833
I'm gonna win this time.

1124
01:24:46,138 --> 01:24:48,698
You used to run campaigns
that meant something.

1125
01:24:48,707 --> 01:24:53,770
They would have meant something
if the candidates I backed had won!

1126
01:24:55,047 --> 01:24:59,381
You know what's like to be on the right
side of every issue on the theory stage?

1127
01:24:59,785 --> 01:25:02,049
The hope that rocks
with every loss?

1128
01:25:03,422 --> 01:25:06,289
Not this time. Never again.

1129
01:25:19,371 --> 01:25:21,134
Back to work! Everybody!

1130
01:25:27,012 --> 01:25:28,809
Look at that!

1131
01:25:29,247 --> 01:25:32,114
You burnt the hot dog,
just a little bit.

1132
01:25:32,618 --> 01:25:33,880
Just the way I like them!

1133
01:25:36,421 --> 01:25:37,854
- Bud?
- Yes?

1134
01:25:39,191 --> 01:25:43,127
I think we should ask
for a Presidential debate.

1135
01:25:45,397 --> 01:25:49,151
Come on! Can't we just talk
about something else for one night?

1136
01:25:49,167 --> 01:25:51,192
Just for a minute? Maybe?

1137
01:25:53,271 --> 01:25:55,865
What did you just say to me?

1138
01:25:57,042 --> 01:26:00,500
A Presidential debate.
Where you get to ask questions.

1139
01:26:00,679 --> 01:26:03,045
Please. Just stop.

1140
01:26:03,181 --> 01:26:05,547
It's important!
It could help you decide.

1141
01:26:05,617 --> 01:26:07,175
Help me decide.

1142
01:26:08,086 --> 01:26:09,542
Think about
what you're saying to me.

1143
01:26:09,554 --> 01:26:12,785
I have! You should read
all this mail you've been getting.

1144
01:26:13,258 --> 01:26:15,158
People are writing
to you for help.

1145
01:26:15,627 --> 01:26:17,720
People are writing me letters.
So what?

1146
01:26:18,230 --> 01:26:20,391
I can't help these people.

1147
01:26:22,334 --> 01:26:23,562
You can speak for them.

1148
01:26:27,939 --> 01:26:28,928
Will you do it for me?

1149
01:26:35,147 --> 01:26:37,945
I'm doing this all
because of you!

1150
01:26:42,954 --> 01:26:46,515
Confirmed, one Presidential debate
will occur this Wednesday night...

1151
01:26:46,992 --> 01:26:50,120
at which Mr. Johnson will ask both
candidates a set of questions.

1152
01:26:50,762 --> 01:26:53,094
The following day,
he'll cast his vote.

1153
01:26:57,469 --> 01:26:59,460
Bud,
what will you ask at the debate?

1154
01:27:00,539 --> 01:27:03,975
Truth is, I don't know yet,
but I'm...

1155
01:27:05,510 --> 01:27:06,704
I'll figure it out.

1156
01:27:12,951 --> 01:27:15,647
I hate debates.
Where they try-to trick you.

1157
01:27:16,021 --> 01:27:17,989
I know, but you'll be fine.

1158
01:27:18,824 --> 01:27:20,849
We have two days
to sew this thing up.

1159
01:27:21,727 --> 01:27:23,456
I'm gonna need you
to meet with Bud again.

1160
01:27:24,896 --> 01:27:27,797
And, offer him a little incentive.

1161
01:27:29,534 --> 01:27:31,593
You want I give him
a bag of cash?

1162
01:27:31,737 --> 01:27:33,602
No, he's got too much
attention on him for that.

1163
01:27:34,139 --> 01:27:36,630
I was thinking
that maybe you'd offer him a job.

1164
01:27:37,175 --> 01:27:40,201
Something with benefits.
If you know what I mean.

1165
01:27:41,012 --> 01:27:42,707
Marty,
I've been meaning to talk to you.

1166
01:27:44,850 --> 01:27:47,444
I'm not sure about our strategy
on this whole Bud thing.

1167
01:27:47,886 --> 01:27:51,083
You've never questioned me before.
On anything.

1168
01:27:51,790 --> 01:27:52,313
Ever.

1169
01:27:52,891 --> 01:27:56,850
I know and I'm not saying
I won't do it. I just...

1170
01:27:58,497 --> 01:27:59,964
I can't shake this feeling...

1171
01:28:01,633 --> 01:28:04,500
The way we've been switching positions,
and now offering Bud...

1172
01:28:06,471 --> 01:28:08,439
We're just doing
what we always do.

1173
01:28:10,575 --> 01:28:11,166
That's all.

1174
01:28:11,943 --> 01:28:15,174
Dancing the dance,
Courting the voters.

1175
01:28:16,715 --> 01:28:19,616
Except this time,
it's only one voter.

1176
01:28:21,453 --> 01:28:22,351
It's one guy.

1177
01:28:23,522 --> 01:28:25,353
This is history,
Mr. President.

1178
01:28:26,691 --> 01:28:28,283
It's never happened before.

1179
01:28:28,827 --> 01:28:32,957
This is a moment the whole
world will remember. Forever.

1180
01:28:35,467 --> 01:28:36,456
I understand.

1181
01:28:43,308 --> 01:28:44,741
What are we about?

1182
01:28:45,644 --> 01:28:46,201
Winning.

1183
01:28:47,979 --> 01:28:51,415
Because if we don't win,
you can't do what you set out to do.

1184
01:28:52,384 --> 01:28:54,318
And what you've done,
won't matter.

1185
01:28:55,053 --> 01:28:58,113
If we don't win,
it's all over.

1186
01:28:59,291 --> 01:29:00,349
And you're over.

1187
01:29:01,893 --> 01:29:02,518
Bud!

1188
01:29:05,964 --> 01:29:06,726
Bud!

1189
01:29:10,769 --> 01:29:11,793
What time is it?

1190
01:29:11,870 --> 01:29:14,964
Late. It's late.
You promised to take me in today.

1191
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:18,806
Okay!
Just give me a few minutes.

1192
01:29:20,145 --> 01:29:22,670
What's today?

1193
01:29:24,716 --> 01:29:25,648
Forget it.

1194
01:29:28,954 --> 01:29:30,751
Can you take me, please?

1195
01:29:33,325 --> 01:29:35,293
Yeah Ye. Let's go.

1196
01:29:40,565 --> 01:29:41,589
Oh, God!

1197
01:29:43,935 --> 01:29:46,460
Hey, wait a minute, Molly.

1198
01:29:54,446 --> 01:29:56,573
Molly! Molly!

1199
01:29:56,648 --> 01:29:59,583
Mr. Johnson... Mr. Johnson!

1200
01:30:00,652 --> 01:30:02,279
The President
would like a word with you.

1201
01:30:02,921 --> 01:30:04,616
- The President?
- Yes, sir.

1202
01:30:07,459 --> 01:30:08,756
Hey, get a life!

1203
01:30:10,962 --> 01:30:14,090
I used to work at Gilmore
before I got laid off.

1204
01:30:14,833 --> 01:30:17,324
Now, I find work wherever I can.

1205
01:30:18,570 --> 01:30:20,868
Mow people's lawns,
fixing stuff.

1206
01:30:22,040 --> 01:30:23,132
Hasn't been easy.

1207
01:30:26,544 --> 01:30:27,135
Molly.

1208
01:30:29,948 --> 01:30:34,282
I'd sure appreciate it if your Dad could
put in a good word for me at the plant.

1209
01:30:35,654 --> 01:30:38,714
Thank you,
Michael and Mr. Everett for that...

1210
01:30:40,025 --> 01:30:41,014
presentation.

1211
01:30:42,327 --> 01:30:43,624
Who's next?

1212
01:30:44,329 --> 01:30:44,920
Molly.

1213
01:31:01,746 --> 01:31:04,078
I guess you all
probably know my dad.

1214
01:31:06,918 --> 01:31:08,909
He really wanted
to be here today, but...

1215
01:31:10,555 --> 01:31:12,648
he had so many
important things to do.

1216
01:31:14,759 --> 01:31:16,351
He's doing his best, but...

1217
01:31:17,662 --> 01:31:19,493
he can't be everywhere at once.

1218
01:31:22,300 --> 01:31:24,393
Ever since
all this stuff happened...

1219
01:31:27,172 --> 01:31:29,367
he's really been
under a lot of pressure.

1220
01:31:32,844 --> 01:31:34,607
I just want you to know that...

1221
01:31:35,580 --> 01:31:38,447
he takes
his responsibilities seriously...

1222
01:31:40,185 --> 01:31:43,621
and that he really cares
about helping poor people...

1223
01:31:44,255 --> 01:31:45,654
and sick people.

1224
01:31:47,392 --> 01:31:49,883
And people
that can't help themselves.

1225
01:31:55,266 --> 01:31:55,891
My...

1226
01:31:59,971 --> 01:32:03,031
my dad wants to make
this country a better place.

1227
01:32:18,323 --> 01:32:19,984
Do you think much
about your future?

1228
01:32:22,227 --> 01:32:23,285
What future?

1229
01:32:24,863 --> 01:32:25,761
I know what you mean.

1230
01:32:26,464 --> 01:32:28,523
We all worry
about the sun down years.

1231
01:32:29,367 --> 01:32:31,699
Sooner or later,
all this hoopla is gonna die down.

1232
01:32:31,970 --> 01:32:33,392
They're gonna build me a library.

1233
01:32:33,405 --> 01:32:35,100
and you're gonna be
just another face in the crowd.

1234
01:32:37,742 --> 01:32:38,606
Can't wait.

1235
01:32:40,512 --> 01:32:42,207
What you need
to think about is security.

1236
01:32:43,381 --> 01:32:44,541
Now I've got a friend...

1237
01:32:46,484 --> 01:32:50,648
who might have a job for you.
In the lobby business.

1238
01:32:52,190 --> 01:32:54,818
Like opening doors for people?

1239
01:32:55,894 --> 01:32:56,792
Very astute!

1240
01:32:57,328 --> 01:33:00,286
Open doors to politicians.
And their checkbooks.

1241
01:33:00,298 --> 01:33:03,529
People really like you, Bud.
They feel like you're one of them.

1242
01:33:05,103 --> 01:33:06,934
I'm not quite following you,
Andy.

1243
01:33:13,344 --> 01:33:15,710
Sometimes you gotta figure
out what you want in this life.

1244
01:33:17,215 --> 01:33:19,410
Then you have to decide
how much it's worth to you.

1245
01:33:20,618 --> 01:33:22,415
Because they're gonna
put it on your tombstone.

1246
01:33:24,389 --> 01:33:25,356
It's your legacy.

1247
01:33:26,958 --> 01:33:28,892
A measure
of what you left behind.

1248
01:33:30,829 --> 01:33:31,591
Are we...

1249
01:33:33,865 --> 01:33:35,628
are we still talking
about the job?

1250
01:33:38,369 --> 01:33:39,768
The lobby business?

1251
01:33:42,607 --> 01:33:45,576
Right. Forget that.

1252
01:33:50,048 --> 01:33:51,174
It's not worth it.

1253
01:34:00,558 --> 01:34:01,422
And thank you.

1254
01:34:36,027 --> 01:34:36,721
Molly!

1255
01:34:37,996 --> 01:34:40,021
You said that
if I ever wanted to talk, right?

1256
01:34:43,501 --> 01:34:44,763
Here's some hot cocoa.

1257
01:34:46,538 --> 01:34:48,529
Sorry.
All I had was skim milk.

1258
01:34:48,773 --> 01:34:49,671
It's okay.

1259
01:34:52,744 --> 01:34:53,711
What's going on?

1260
01:34:55,346 --> 01:34:57,814
- It's all my fault.
- What's your fault?

1261
01:34:58,149 --> 01:35:00,208
Bud was supposed
to meet me after school.

1262
01:35:00,418 --> 01:35:03,319
He knew how important it was to me.
But he got drunk.

1263
01:35:04,088 --> 01:35:07,546
He never even showed up.
I didn't know what else to do!

1264
01:35:07,559 --> 01:35:09,754
Wait, Molly,
what are you saying?

1265
01:35:11,696 --> 01:35:12,287
Molly?

1266
01:35:13,865 --> 01:35:14,957
Aren't you gonna get that?

1267
01:35:16,401 --> 01:35:20,701
Yeah, give me two seconds. Stay here.
I'm gonna get them off the phone.

1268
01:35:30,949 --> 01:35:35,886
<i>Can call you back?</i>
<i>This isn't a good time. Yeah, I know.</i>

1269
01:35:37,222 --> 01:35:38,780
<i>I know.</i>
<i>You already told me that.</i>

1270
01:35:46,831 --> 01:35:48,799
<i>Look, can I call you back?</i>

1271
01:35:49,500 --> 01:35:50,159
Molly?

1272
01:35:51,803 --> 01:35:52,497
Molly!

1273
01:36:08,820 --> 01:36:09,445
Are you okay?

1274
01:36:11,022 --> 01:36:13,013
You think your dad
might be passed out tonight?

1275
01:36:16,928 --> 01:36:18,987
<i>Then,</i>
<i>you're going to recast your vote.</i>

1276
01:36:19,097 --> 01:36:21,725
<i>I guess it ain't</i>
<i>that much of a secret then, is it?</i>

1277
01:36:25,470 --> 01:36:29,338
<i>If we are to be the exception to history,</i>
<i>then we must break the cycle.</i>

1278
01:36:29,941 --> 01:36:31,772
<i>For those</i>
<i>who do not remember the past...</i>

1279
01:36:33,778 --> 01:36:35,712
<i>Remind me again who's running?</i>

1280
01:36:35,913 --> 01:36:38,279
<i>So, what you're saying is,</i>
<i>you're keeping...</i>

1281
01:36:38,750 --> 01:36:41,981
<i>It's all my fault. Bud was supposed</i>
<i>to meet me after school.</i>

1282
01:36:42,120 --> 01:36:45,351
<i>He knew how important this</i>
<i>was to me. But he got drunk.</i>

1283
01:36:45,757 --> 01:36:49,090
<i>He didn't even show up.</i>
<i>I didn't know what else to do!</i>

1284
01:36:49,360 --> 01:36:50,645
<i>Molly, what are you saying?</i>

1285
01:36:50,662 --> 01:36:51,651
He didn't vote!

1286
01:36:54,599 --> 01:36:56,191
What do you mean,
she's missing?

1287
01:36:56,200 --> 01:36:57,656
I'm sorry, Mr. Johnson.
It's all my fault.

1288
01:36:57,669 --> 01:36:58,988
For crying out loud, Lewis!

1289
01:36:59,003 --> 01:37:02,962
You guys guard Presidents.

1290
01:37:04,709 --> 01:37:05,641
She's smarter!

1291
01:37:08,279 --> 01:37:09,177
Tell me about it!

1292
01:37:21,092 --> 01:37:22,354
What is all this?

1293
01:37:23,394 --> 01:37:24,884
She's been answering your mail.

1294
01:37:25,830 --> 01:37:26,455
For what?

1295
01:37:29,200 --> 01:37:32,727
She wanted people
to think that you cared.

1296
01:37:34,305 --> 01:37:35,237
She told you that?

1297
01:37:49,454 --> 01:37:52,582
Does have any friends
we should contact?

1298
01:37:52,657 --> 01:37:53,487
I don't know.

1299
01:37:58,730 --> 01:38:01,824
No, she's not the friend type.

1300
01:38:03,034 --> 01:38:03,591
Jed.

1301
01:38:04,802 --> 01:38:07,589
- Jed? Who's Jed?
- It's a boy she likes.

1302
01:38:07,605 --> 01:38:09,800
She likes a boy?

1303
01:38:10,108 --> 01:38:12,099
Jed Barkley.
He's in her class.

1304
01:38:12,276 --> 01:38:14,676
He's a little shy,
but they're friends.

1305
01:38:15,413 --> 01:38:19,372
- Is she told you that?
- Yes, sir.

1306
01:38:25,022 --> 01:38:26,649
Do you have any idea
where she might be going?

1307
01:38:33,197 --> 01:38:36,132
Yeah, I'm can guess
where she's going.

1308
01:38:36,667 --> 01:38:38,464
Just tell us where,
we'll go pick her up, sir.

1309
01:38:41,339 --> 01:38:45,002
She's my daughter.
I'll get her myself.

1310
01:39:11,669 --> 01:39:12,533
This is it.

1311
01:39:14,372 --> 01:39:15,600
Sure you wanna go in?

1312
01:39:17,375 --> 01:39:18,967
Came this far, didn't we?

1313
01:39:20,878 --> 01:39:23,938
I'll wait here awhile.
Just in case you want to go home.

1314
01:39:29,287 --> 01:39:30,754
I never want to go home.

1315
01:40:06,290 --> 01:40:06,779
Yes?

1316
01:40:07,992 --> 01:40:09,619
I'm looking for Larissa Star.

1317
01:40:11,429 --> 01:40:15,866
Well, she's gone.
She's moved out a long time ago.

1318
01:40:22,006 --> 01:40:23,132
I think you're her.

1319
01:40:31,949 --> 01:40:32,711
You Jed?

1320
01:40:34,886 --> 01:40:37,446
- It's okay, is she in there?
- Yes, sir.

1321
01:40:39,657 --> 01:40:40,589
Wait here.

1322
01:40:49,367 --> 01:40:50,527
You're all grown up!

1323
01:40:51,936 --> 01:40:53,130
You look like your dad.

1324
01:40:54,805 --> 01:40:56,363
He says I look like you.

1325
01:40:57,341 --> 01:41:01,141
Does he?
So, why did you come here?

1326
01:41:02,446 --> 01:41:06,314
You wrote me a letter.
You said I could come live with you.

1327
01:41:07,485 --> 01:41:09,919
That was a long time ago,
honey.

1328
01:41:11,722 --> 01:41:13,485
Things have changed.

1329
01:41:14,659 --> 01:41:17,856
I'm close to getting
a record deal.

1330
01:41:18,930 --> 01:41:20,795
I did a gig
a couple of months ago.

1331
01:41:21,098 --> 01:41:26,491
This guy wants to put me in touch
with this big time Nashville producer.

1332
01:41:26,504 --> 01:41:28,131
So he's gonna call me.
I'm not gonna be ready.

1333
01:41:29,040 --> 01:41:32,999
I gotta get ready. There's a lot
I gotta do, so I can't do this.

1334
01:41:34,712 --> 01:41:37,909
I'm not well.
Can't you see that?

1335
01:41:39,884 --> 01:41:41,715
I can take care of you, Mom.

1336
01:41:41,953 --> 01:41:45,047
I don't want anybody to take care
of me. I don't want you here.

1337
01:41:46,223 --> 01:41:47,155
Dad!

1338
01:41:50,828 --> 01:41:52,489
Jesus Christ, Larissa!

1339
01:41:53,297 --> 01:41:55,015
I don't want her
to see me like this.

1340
01:41:55,032 --> 01:41:58,763
Molly, you gotta go outside, okay?
For me. You got out there and wait.

1341
01:41:59,236 --> 01:42:02,034
- Dad!
- Just outside. Now!

1342
01:42:11,182 --> 01:42:14,276
I heard you'd finally
gotten cleaned up.

1343
01:42:14,652 --> 01:42:18,281
Who told you that? My God,
what is going on out there?

1344
01:42:18,356 --> 01:42:19,106
I can't explain.

1345
01:42:19,123 --> 01:42:23,355
What are you, famous now? You think
you can just come? I can't do this!

1346
01:42:23,461 --> 01:42:26,624
- Wait...
- No! No! Come here.

1347
01:42:26,897 --> 01:42:28,182
I'm not mad Larissa.

1348
01:42:28,199 --> 01:42:29,393
I'm trying to tell you...

1349
01:42:29,800 --> 01:42:33,588
I can't be a mom right now.
I can't. Stay back! I can't...

1350
01:42:33,604 --> 01:42:37,597
be a mom right now.
I can't do it. I can't do it.

1351
01:43:50,281 --> 01:43:51,714
Said no reporters, Lewis.

1352
01:43:51,916 --> 01:43:53,269
I just want to talk to you.

1353
01:43:53,284 --> 01:43:54,717
I don't have time, Kate.

1354
01:43:55,219 --> 01:43:59,576
I'm moderating a Presidential debate
tomorrow night in front of a zillion.

1355
01:43:59,590 --> 01:44:03,253
So as much as I'd love for you
to make an ass out of me again on TV...

1356
01:44:03,427 --> 01:44:05,019
I kinda have
some preparing to do.

1357
01:44:09,400 --> 01:44:11,834
I have to catch up
on the issues.

1358
01:44:12,903 --> 01:44:14,268
Like all of them!

1359
01:44:14,839 --> 01:44:15,362
Bud.

1360
01:44:19,043 --> 01:44:20,943
I know what happened
election night.

1361
01:44:22,146 --> 01:44:25,309
I'm running the story. I just want
to make sure I've got my facts right.

1362
01:44:25,783 --> 01:44:29,651
The bartender claims you
left the Starline about 7:30.

1363
01:44:30,287 --> 01:44:30,981
Is that correct?

1364
01:44:31,756 --> 01:44:32,518
Yes, madam.

1365
01:44:32,957 --> 01:44:36,154
Giving you plenty of time
to meet at the polling station...

1366
01:44:37,027 --> 01:44:38,085
and cast your vote...

1367
01:44:38,729 --> 01:44:39,286
right?

1368
01:44:42,399 --> 01:44:45,232
I... guess so.

1369
01:44:46,670 --> 01:44:47,728
Just making sure.

1370
01:44:50,608 --> 01:44:53,634
I'm sorry.
I got something for you.

1371
01:44:57,114 --> 01:44:59,082
Kinda forgot who I was
for a moment.

1372
01:44:59,950 --> 01:45:00,939
Forgive me?

1373
01:45:02,119 --> 01:45:02,915
That depends.

1374
01:45:04,655 --> 01:45:07,215
Can you help me,
help him tonight?

1375
01:45:10,461 --> 01:45:11,393
I'd love to.

1376
01:45:12,229 --> 01:45:14,993
I work two jobs
just trying to make ends meet.

1377
01:45:15,599 --> 01:45:17,157
Last year my son
was diagnosed with...

1378
01:45:17,168 --> 01:45:22,572
Law makers renewed the primary programs
for low income HIV and AIDS patients.

1379
01:45:22,907 --> 01:45:25,842
Named for Ryan White,
a young AIDS activist...

1380
01:46:46,423 --> 01:46:47,583
<i>Good evening everyone.</i>

1381
01:46:47,791 --> 01:46:51,124
<i>We come to you live</i>
<i>from a small American town...</i>

1382
01:46:51,629 --> 01:46:54,962
<i>a town most of us had never</i>
<i>heard of just a few weeks ago.</i>

1383
01:46:55,165 --> 01:46:57,292
A town you couldn't find
on the map...

1384
01:46:57,301 --> 01:47:00,759
because Texico, New Mexico,
wasn't on the map.

1385
01:47:01,472 --> 01:47:02,837
<i>But it's on the map now.</i>

1386
01:47:02,907 --> 01:47:06,707
<i>The whole world has descended</i>
<i>on this town for an historic event.</i>

1387
01:47:06,844 --> 01:47:09,745
<i>A political debate</i>
<i>unlike any other.</i>

1388
01:47:09,880 --> 01:47:12,474
<i>Tomorrow morning,</i>
<i>Earnest Bud Johnson...</i>

1389
01:47:12,549 --> 01:47:15,211
<i>will walk into a voting booth</i>
<i>and make a choice.</i>

1390
01:47:15,753 --> 01:47:20,884
And his choice will affect
our lives for generations to come.

1391
01:47:21,458 --> 01:47:25,121
the stakes could not be higher.
What do you expect?

1392
01:47:25,195 --> 01:47:29,063
I wonder, Aaron, what the founding
fathers would make of all this.

1393
01:47:29,266 --> 01:47:32,963
Would they be mortified,
or would they be jumping for joy?

1394
01:47:33,103 --> 01:47:36,334
Something tells me
that somewhere right now...

1395
01:47:36,507 --> 01:47:40,967
Franklin and Jefferson
are looking down and smiling.

1396
01:47:41,378 --> 01:47:42,902
Smiling or laughing?

1397
01:47:43,080 --> 01:47:45,071
I don't know if they're smiling.

1398
01:47:45,082 --> 01:47:48,415
That's not exactly who they had in mind
for picking the President of the USA.

1399
01:47:48,585 --> 01:47:53,079
We're sending someone out there who
really is, as far as, we can tell lost.

1400
01:47:53,223 --> 01:47:56,386
Can he find himself suddenly,
tonight on this stage...

1401
01:47:56,527 --> 01:47:58,893
Or is he going to look
like a rodeo clown down there?

1402
01:47:59,029 --> 01:48:03,193
Tonight, the whole country is
watching and we watch with you.

1403
01:48:04,201 --> 01:48:05,532
I'm gonna puke.

1404
01:48:05,602 --> 01:48:07,661
Bud, look at me. Look at me.

1405
01:48:08,305 --> 01:48:11,035
Just be yourself.
You're gonna be great.

1406
01:48:14,979 --> 01:48:18,005
Hey, remember dad.
No cussing! Okay?

1407
01:48:18,482 --> 01:48:20,006
- Fine.
- Fine.

1408
01:48:20,985 --> 01:48:22,919
Mr. Johnson,
one minute, please.

1409
01:48:26,223 --> 01:48:27,121
Good luck!

1410
01:48:31,762 --> 01:48:32,922
<i>And so we begin.</i>

1411
01:48:33,364 --> 01:48:36,231
<i>The crowd has settled down</i>
<i>and we go to the stage...</i>

1412
01:48:36,300 --> 01:48:37,767
<i>for what promises to be...</i>

1413
01:48:38,302 --> 01:48:42,500
<i>one of the most unique moments</i>
<i>in American political history.</i>

1414
01:49:25,916 --> 01:49:28,476
Mr. President, Mr. Greenleaf...

1415
01:49:29,653 --> 01:49:33,054
I'd like to thank you for your
hospitality. It's been real interesting.

1416
01:49:33,924 --> 01:49:36,518
I've said a lot of thing
I didn't mean.

1417
01:49:37,327 --> 01:49:38,817
and you both
made a lot of promises...

1418
01:49:38,829 --> 01:49:40,456
you probably
won't be able to keep.

1419
01:49:49,840 --> 01:49:52,866
To be honest, the last 10 days
have felt like a weird dream.

1420
01:49:53,710 --> 01:49:55,871
What was once kinda funny,
isn't anymore.

1421
01:49:57,748 --> 01:49:58,942
From what I've read, I've...

1422
01:50:01,118 --> 01:50:03,518
well, I've scared
the hell out of America.

1423
01:50:04,488 --> 01:50:07,889
I know that the world is watching,
maybe even laughing.

1424
01:50:08,358 --> 01:50:10,451
people on my own TV,
are saying...

1425
01:50:10,727 --> 01:50:13,958
that America, somehow,
deserves this moment.

1426
01:50:15,933 --> 01:50:17,230
Guess that means me.

1427
01:50:20,104 --> 01:50:24,063
I can't say that I've been much
of anything most of my life.

1428
01:50:24,141 --> 01:50:26,871
It's sorta like somewhere
along the way...

1429
01:50:27,878 --> 01:50:31,700
I checked out and it's not like
I had big dreams to begin with.

1430
01:50:31,715 --> 01:50:34,741
but I had something once.

1431
01:50:35,953 --> 01:50:40,811
I had something close
to faith or hope or whatever...

1432
01:50:40,824 --> 01:50:43,258
whatever word you want
to use for how good life could be.

1433
01:50:45,095 --> 01:50:49,555
But then, the years start moving
quicker and all of a sudden...

1434
01:50:49,566 --> 01:50:51,500
what's going good
out there for every else...

1435
01:50:53,203 --> 01:50:54,693
isn't going so good for you.

1436
01:50:56,039 --> 01:50:58,906
But, tonight I feel...

1437
01:51:00,744 --> 01:51:01,642
embarrassed.

1438
01:51:05,082 --> 01:51:07,448
I've had my chances,
more than most.

1439
01:51:08,752 --> 01:51:10,344
I've grown up
in a country where...

1440
01:51:10,687 --> 01:51:14,885
if I decided to do more with my life
than just drift and drink...

1441
01:51:15,392 --> 01:51:16,984
that I could be standing where...

1442
01:51:18,595 --> 01:51:20,256
where maybe you stand tonight.

1443
01:51:21,031 --> 01:51:24,933
Instead, I've taken freely
and I've given nothing.

1444
01:51:26,170 --> 01:51:27,637
I'm ashamed in front of my...

1445
01:51:29,540 --> 01:51:30,165
daughter.

1446
01:51:33,477 --> 01:51:34,535
And my country.

1447
01:51:36,647 --> 01:51:38,831
I've never served or sacrificed.

1448
01:51:38,849 --> 01:51:43,286
The only heavy lifting
I've been asked is simple stuff, like...

1449
01:51:43,620 --> 01:51:46,851
pay attention. Vote...

1450
01:51:49,560 --> 01:51:51,050
For America has a...

1451
01:51:53,030 --> 01:51:55,965
if America has a true enemy tonight,
I guess it's me.

1452
01:51:58,535 --> 01:52:02,528
Tonight a below average man is going
to choose between two exceptional men.

1453
01:52:03,507 --> 01:52:05,998
Tomorrow, one man's vote
is going to make a difference...

1454
01:52:07,377 --> 01:52:09,208
'Cause tomorrow
we're gonna have a President.

1455
01:52:09,513 --> 01:52:12,107
And not just someone
to fill a chair in Washington.

1456
01:52:13,817 --> 01:52:16,342
We need someone
who's bigger than their speeches.

1457
01:52:17,321 --> 01:52:20,984
The kind of President
we learned about in school.

1458
01:52:23,126 --> 01:52:24,787
America needs a big thinker.

1459
01:52:27,164 --> 01:52:29,223
You know, like a giant, really.

1460
01:52:29,566 --> 01:52:32,729
Someone who has the good sense
to get in front of our problems.

1461
01:52:33,203 --> 01:52:36,366
somebody who has the wisdom
to lead to us a place...

1462
01:52:36,373 --> 01:52:38,739
where we're at peace
with ourselves and the world.

1463
01:52:40,711 --> 01:52:43,976
And just for the record,
I want you both...

1464
01:52:45,215 --> 01:52:48,013
I want you both to know
that I think a hella lot of you.

1465
01:52:58,862 --> 01:53:03,299
Tonight, I am going to speak
for people I have never met...

1466
01:53:06,436 --> 01:53:09,337
whose letters touched me
in a way I didn't think was possible.

1467
01:53:12,576 --> 01:53:14,544
My first question comes from...

1468
01:53:14,845 --> 01:53:16,972
Peter Manthis,
in Henderson, Kentucky.

1469
01:53:17,381 --> 01:53:18,575
"Dear Mr. Johnson...

1470
01:53:18,782 --> 01:53:21,444
my wife and I
have three little girls.

1471
01:53:21,518 --> 01:53:25,079
We both work two jobs
just trying to make ends meet.

1472
01:53:26,723 --> 01:53:29,317
And some weeks,
we don't make it."

1473
01:53:30,027 --> 01:53:32,882
"When you work hard and you still
can't take care of your family...

1474
01:53:32,896 --> 01:53:36,525
you start to question yourself
as a provider, as a man.

1475
01:53:37,668 --> 01:53:40,865
I know I am one. I fought
for my country and I'm proud of it.

1476
01:53:42,572 --> 01:53:46,941
But it scares me to think about what
would happen if one of my kids got sick.

1477
01:53:48,578 --> 01:53:53,015
"Can you ask the candidates,
if we are richest country in the world...

1478
01:53:54,518 --> 01:53:57,510
how come some many of us can
barely afford to live here?"

1479
01:54:00,624 --> 01:54:03,115
I'd like to take that one first,
if I might, Mr. Greenleaf.

1480
01:54:04,194 --> 01:54:05,491
Answer, Mr. President.

1481
01:54:07,731 --> 01:54:11,633
Bud, I'd first like to say, how much
I appreciate your thoughtfulness.

1482
