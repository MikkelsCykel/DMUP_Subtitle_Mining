Welcome to the California Gold Coast

2
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:49,982
A magical land where
the sun always shines

3
00:00:50,116 --> 00:00:52,346
and the surf always rolls

4
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:56,615
A place where a million dollars
might buy ya a view

5
00:00:56,756 --> 00:00:58,246
of another guy's view

6
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,325
Once upon a time

7
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:04,362
this was the home
of the legendary Bobby Z

8
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:07,326
You see that out there, folks

9
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:10,300
That's Bobby Z's territory, my friends

10
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:11,699
He ruled those waters

11
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:13,135
He was Poseidon

12
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:14,934
He was Neptune

13
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,270
His heart beat with
the rhythm of those waves

14
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,207
And when the sun set

15
00:01:19,345 --> 00:01:23,577
Z blessed this land
with the most amazing

16
00:01:24,784 --> 00:01:27,048
weed known to man

17
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:32,216
In those days if 5 yuppies smoked a bowl
after their poached salmon

18
00:01:32,358 --> 00:01:36,590
well, it was Z's weed, guaranteed

19
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:39,129
Z's gone now

20
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:41,825
6 years, maybe more

21
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:43,458
Some say he's in Europe

22
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:46,766
Some say even Thailand, maybe Japan

23
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:51,240
The doubters, the non-believers say
they all of course, he's dead

24
00:01:51,377 --> 00:01:54,471
But he's coming back. I know it

25
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:56,309
Water is life

26
00:01:56,449 --> 00:02:00,408
From it he sprang
and to it he shall return

27
00:02:00,553 --> 00:02:03,989
Bobby Z is gonna be rebirthed

28
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:08,788
Bobby Z is gonna be resurrected

29
00:02:08,928 --> 00:02:10,555
He's coming back

30
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:16,761
The great Bobby Z is coming back

31
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:23,467
This guy's perfect

32
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:27,046
His name is Tim Kearney
3-time loser from Palmdale

33
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,645
He definitely resembles him

34
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:32,348
Family

35
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:33,816
Mom's dead, dad split

36
00:02:33,953 --> 00:02:35,079
Hm

37
00:02:35,722 --> 00:02:37,485
Uncles, aunts, brothers, sisters

38
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:41,082
Tim's an only child
on his own since he was 15

39
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,758
First gets busted when he was a kid
for breaking and entering

40
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:45,888
when he trips over a lawn sprinkler
on the way out the door

41
00:02:46,032 --> 00:02:47,397
carrying his stash

42
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,927
Goes to juvie, comes out, does it again

43
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:52,503
By this time he gets a court-mandated
stint in the Marines

44
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,334
Gets his ass sent to Iraq
Hm

45
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:56,032
Alright, where he wins the Navy cross

46
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,700
and then gets a dishonorable discharge

47
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:58,970
For what

48
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:00,443
Beating up an Iraqi colonel

49
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,309
Should've give 'im a medal

50
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:04,410
Then he comes back to the States

51
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:06,280
where he commits assault
and battery strongarm

52
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:07,977
on a convenience store clerk

53
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:09,986
for raising the price
on an ice cream bar

54
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:12,455
Thought it was eightyfive cents
Dollar fifteen

55
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,027
Strike 1

56
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:17,291
Now get this. He gets paroled, right
Mm

57
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,091
His dipshit buddy Wayne picks him up

58
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:20,927
On the way home
he stops at a gas station

59
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:23,092
Tim's waiting in the car, Wayne goes in

60
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:24,396
Okay, here's the beaut

61
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:26,232
Wayne robs the gas station

62
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:27,134
Tim takes the rap

63
00:03:27,273 --> 00:03:28,865
Open the door! Open the door

64
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:30,236
Go! Oh shit, there's a cop

65
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:30,808
There's a cop

66
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,571
Open the door! Go

67
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:33,872
Strike 2

68
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:37,914
Which leads us to
our dead biker friend, Maddog

69
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:42,077
Been here 6 months now, boy

70
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,247
You need protection, and we're it

71
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,618
Just wanna do my time, man

72
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:47,726
Don't work like that, soldier boy

73
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,325
Strike 3

74
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:05,759
Heartbreakin'

75
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:06,887
Yeah

76
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:08,222
Yeah, he's fucked

77
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:12,270
The Brotherhood'll get him no matter
what prison yard he ends up on

78
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:15,932
Shit, Brotherhood'll kill you no matter
where you end up, period

79
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:26,541
How'd you get to be
such a loser, convict, hm

80
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:29,621
Uh, what is it, low self-esteem

81
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:31,587
Lack of impulse control

82
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,624
Man, I can't remember
what they described

83
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,820
Well I see you had a lot of practice
from your file, here

84
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:38,055
Yeah

85
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:39,755
You know why you're here

86
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,060
Probably 'cause you want me
to roll over on somebody, right

87
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:45,034
Wrong. We don't want you
to roll over on somebody

88
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:47,195
We want you to be somebody

89
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,501
That's what my mom used to say

90
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:55,143
Why don't you stop fooling around

91
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:57,476
and maybe just maybe
if you do like I say dude

92
00:06:57,617 --> 00:06:59,482
you can walk away
from here and keep walking

93
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:01,746
Would you like that convict

94
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:03,711
Good

95
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:07,853
Look at him

96
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:10,721
Look at him

97
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:12,793
Who does he look like

98
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:17,362
Does he look like anybody you know

99
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,061
Well he kinda looks like me

100
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:21,239
You know who that is

101
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:23,774
That is Bobby Z

102
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,844
Robert James Zacharias, man

103
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:27,104
Grew up in Laguna Beach

104
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:28,907
While you were shitting
your life down the toilet

105
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:30,345
he was The Dude

106
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:31,950
The Man
Oh, he had it all, man

107
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:33,711
The hottest women, the finest clothes

108
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:34,751
the best dope

109
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:36,616
He was living the life, man

110
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:38,053
But he had another talent

111
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:41,251
See, Bobby was also
a very accomplished drug dealer

112
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:43,362
Matter of fact, he was a legend at 16

113
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:45,327
Couldn't even get a driver's license

114
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:48,957
He hitchhiked to
and from his first weed buy

115
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:51,831
2 Nike bags, 8 Ki's of Maui Wowee

116
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:56,567
Z turns 2 gym bags into 4
4 into 16, 16 into 32

117
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:58,609
Unlike you convict
he figures it all out

118
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:00,541
'Cause he never puts
his own ass on the line

119
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,978
But he's getting some unwanted
attention not from the cops

120
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:04,480
but from some other

121
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:06,744
businessmen, some rivals

122
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:08,581
2 of his best runners end up face-down

123
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:11,019
in a drainage ditch
out there in Riverside

124
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,681
So what does Z do

125
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,292
He disappears

126
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:16,759
like morning mist

127
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,423
Now the dope still keeps coming

128
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:20,862
And we're wondering how

129
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,432
Turns out

130
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:24,161
Bobby Z's got a marketing system

131
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:25,395
Yeah, it's genius

132
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:27,597
Cutouts, bonuses, agents

133
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:28,832
Profit-sharing

134
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:30,203
All kinds of shit

135
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:34,302
I mean he's bringing in boatloads of
the best weed from all over the world

136
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:36,176
brings it in electronically

137
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:38,010
running his empire from afar

138
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:42,086
like he's a goddamned
wizard of weed or some shit

139
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,290
So what do you want me to do

140
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,261
Don Huertero

141
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:53,024
Biggest drug dealer in Northern Mexico

142
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:56,191
Runs Tijuana, runs Baja, runs San Diego

143
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:59,327
He wants to partner up with Bobby Z
and start marching north

144
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:00,461
to Los Angeles

145
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:04,975
Now, this Don Huertero
is holding a man in Mexico

146
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:11,745
His name is Art Moreno
He's my partner

147
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,613
He's a good man. He's got five kids

148
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:14,845
and I'm godfather to all of 'em

149
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:17,217
I'd like my partner to see
my partner come home alive

150
00:09:17,356 --> 00:09:20,086
Don Huertero has agreed
to make an exchange

151
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,591
Art Moreno for Bobby Z

152
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,422
But only for Bobby Z

153
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:24,325
So why don't you find him

154
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:25,589
We had him

155
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:28,256
Turned himself in, in the embassy
in Thailand, sick as a dog

156
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,959
Got bit by some Asian bug

157
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:31,296
Walks into the embassy

158
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:33,564
says his name is Robert James Zacharias

159
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:34,695
says he's dying

160
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,501
says he needs to speak with somebody

161
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:38,576
so I'm on a plane pronto

162
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:39,905
But I'm too late

163
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:41,808
Kaboom, heart attack

164
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:44,109
Drops dead right there in the embassy

165
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,740
God damn bug killed him

166
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:46,749
So listen up

167
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:47,545
This is where you come in

168
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:48,415
Look

169
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:51,079
Don Huertero's got
no sense of humor about this shit

170
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:53,350
If he finds out
that the real Z is dead

171
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:54,891
he'll kill my partner

172
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:55,959
Dead for dead

173
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,995
You pretend to be Z

174
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:00,822
We make a trade with you at the border

175
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:02,935
and if you walk away, well

176
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:04,764
you walk away

177
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:07,630
Man, the second I walk in there

178
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:10,435
Don Huertero's gonna know
I'm not Bobby Z

179
00:10:10,576 --> 00:10:13,272
Huertero and Z have never met
It's up to you

180
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:15,812
You take your chances on the border
pretending to be Bobby Z

181
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:19,349
or we leave you here
at the Hotel California

182
00:10:27,593 --> 00:10:28,082
Perfect

183
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:29,660
I'll be damned

184
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:31,794
Tell me how you got that scar again

185
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:32,693
l...

186
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:34,626
I. I, I

187
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:37,895
I was surfing and my head bounced
off a rock when I wiped out

188
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:38,435
Where

189
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:39,970
Uh, Three Arch Bay

190
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:42,165
What kind of car do you drive
A sixty-six Mustang

191
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,468
Favorite color
Yellow

192
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:45,509
Favorite football team
He hates football

193
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:46,475
I hate football

194
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:47,772
I hate football

195
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:48,971
Favorite meal

196
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:50,613
Uh...

197
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,047
Come on! Vegetarian chili

198
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:54,812
How many times we gotta go over this

199
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,159
Lunch time, Z

200
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:04,119
You're welcome
Oh, come on man

201
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:05,025
Can I get some real food

202
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,392
like a cheeseburger or something

203
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:09,296
No. Z was a vegetarian

204
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,300
And a leftie

205
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:24,874
You make one mistake
like that with Don Huertero

206
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,644
you're a dead man, okay

207
00:11:36,662 --> 00:11:37,594
Remember her

208
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:38,792
That's Audrey
No

209
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:40,193
Not Audrey, Olivia

210
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:42,323
Olivia

211
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:46,436
Elizabeth

212
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:47,937
Oh, yeah, you remember her name

213
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:49,268
don't you

214
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,476
How long was I with her for

215
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,672
I don't know

216
00:11:56,515 --> 00:11:58,244
I thought you guys knew everything

217
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:06,682
Why would I wanna be with anybody else

218
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,889
Shut up, and get up

219
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:33,577
Hey, one last thing

220
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:35,380
If Huertero mentions The Monk

221
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:37,141
he was your chief of operations

222
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:38,108
The Monk

223
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,148
You're just telling me about this now

224
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:39,842
They won't ask you

225
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,976
Well in case it comes up
you should know

226
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:43,315
Youguys went to high school together

227
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:45,514
The Monk went toNotre Dame
then joined the Franciscan Order

228
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,455
He has some serious math skills

229
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:49,561
Started putting
the monastery's books on Quicken

230
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,957
Fell in love with the internet

231
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:52,688
Discovered he loved it
more than he loved God

232
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:53,730
So he quits the church

233
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:55,766
and helps you
make your business electronic

234
00:13:56,902 --> 00:13:59,598
Without The Monk, Z wouldn't be Z

235
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:02,332
Here's uh, The Monk's number
and address in case you need it

236
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:04,406
You got- you got another vest for me

237
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:07,011
Hey, you just relax
you stand over there for a minute

238
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:13,247
I sent that recommendation
for your promotion upstairs, Escobar

239
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:15,353
I'm gonna get your partner
back for you, sir

240
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:16,784
I appreciate it

241
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:40,163
Let's go

242
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:04,229
Good luck

243
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,505
Okay cowboy

244
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:04,686
Don't shoot

245
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:06,717
Don't shoot

246
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,476
Don't move

247
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:31,879
Oh my god.

248
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:33,848
There's an exchange...

249
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:35,647
I'm supposed to exchange...

250
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:37,346
God damn it

251
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:39,480
Shut up

252
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:40,557
Let me go
Get up

253
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:42,956
Get out of the tracks! Move out...

254
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:03,569
Senor Z

255
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:06,738
That's me

256
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:44,573
Mr. Z

257
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:46,950
Mr. Z

258
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:50,178
Huh

259
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:51,653
I brought you clothes

260
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:52,950
The bathroom's right there

261
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:54,683
You can uh, shave

262
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:57,056
I brought you a new toothbrush

263
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:38,493
Gracias

264
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:22,739
Mr. Z

265
00:21:22,881 --> 00:21:25,315
Mr. Z. Hi

266
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:27,580
Mr. Brian would like
to see you right now

267
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:29,016
if it's convenient

268
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:38,696
Come on
Sure

269
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:44,165
Hey

270
00:21:44,903 --> 00:21:46,666
The legend that is Bobby Z

271
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,701
Well, it's an honor, my friend

272
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,603
Brian. Brian Cervier

273
00:21:50,742 --> 00:21:51,834
Good to see you

274
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,672
Well welcome to my humble abode

275
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:55,305
Get him a glass of wine

276
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,608
Squeezed from my own grapes

277
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,115
Don Huertero apologizes for uh

278
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:02,152
not being here to greet
you personally, but um

279
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:04,187
he'll be up on the weekend, so

280
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,847
'til then you just

281
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:09,222
chill and enjoy the oasis

282
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:10,521
Bobby Z

283
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:15,397
Bobby Z

284
00:22:16,568 --> 00:22:18,126
At my hacienda

285
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,601
Who'd have thought

286
00:22:21,873 --> 00:22:23,807
A hundred acres of vineyards

287
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:26,206
Dating back to the fifteen hundreds

288
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:30,413
So, what happened out there last night

289
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:33,143
Cop started shooting
man, so I hit the dirt

290
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:35,048
It's a dangerous place, the border

291
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,313
Get some towels

292
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:37,786
So what are your plans

293
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:41,288
Uh, man, I don't make plans. Just uh...

294
00:22:41,426 --> 00:22:42,586
Really

295
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:45,754
I'm only asking because Don Huertero
has a proposition for you

296
00:22:45,897 --> 00:22:47,797
A serious one

297
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:51,334
Well then uh, I'll talk about
that with the don when he gets here

298
00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:54,068
Well I won't take that as an insult

299
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,195
Don't

300
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:00,305
Alright now, this is a beauty

301
00:23:00,445 --> 00:23:02,242
Horse in England called Great Run

302
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:04,042
won The National a couple of times

303
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:06,116
And this, this is its foal

304
00:23:06,251 --> 00:23:09,015
Unfortunately, it broke its leg

305
00:23:09,154 --> 00:23:11,247
Fuckin' useless and I haven't
got the heart to shoot it

306
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:14,882
This is my most valuable product

307
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:16,785
You got connections in Thailand, right

308
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:17,860
Come here

309
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:20,554
Thais, I get a lot of money for Thais

310
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,664
Give ya a massage and then cook you
a nice green chicken curry afterwards

311
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:27,938
Hurry up
Hey, what you doing, Dumbo

312
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:29,267
don't bruise the fruit

313
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:30,340
It's a product

314
00:23:30,475 --> 00:23:31,942
If you bruise it
then no one will want it

315
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,101
Okay

316
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:37,043
Bill, just get your men
in order, will ya

317
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:38,342
You give me some decent money
to pay for help

318
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:41,145
I wouldn't have morons working for me

319
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:47,888
Right. So

320
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:49,858
Massage parlor

321
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:51,155
Massage parlor

322
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:52,820
Massage parlor

323
00:23:52,964 --> 00:23:54,488
You, massage parlor

324
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:58,262
These ugly ones over here
send them to the sweat shop

325
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:02,037
And this, this is Bobby Z

326
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:14,908
Pleasure

327
00:24:15,053 --> 00:24:15,951
Likewise

328
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:18,621
Used to herd cattle

329
00:24:25,897 --> 00:24:27,057
Jules, wait a minute

330
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:34,798
Who are these people

331
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:37,909
Oh you know, Eurotrash, crazy Russians

332
00:24:38,043 --> 00:24:40,603
friends from the import export business

333
00:24:40,745 --> 00:24:42,474
And of course the lovely Elizabeth

334
00:24:42,614 --> 00:24:44,172
I trust you slept well

335
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,181
Yeah
And alone

336
00:24:51,356 --> 00:24:52,948
Is that uh, is that her boy

337
00:24:53,758 --> 00:24:55,851
Oh no, that's Olivia's beautiful

338
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,188
beautiful boy

339
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:01,592
Where is Olivia

340
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:03,395
She's at Betty Ford

341
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:05,002
This time for speed

342
00:25:05,136 --> 00:25:07,070
She asked Elizabeth
to look after the kid

343
00:25:07,205 --> 00:25:08,866
6 months ago

344
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:14,403
Sir Brian

345
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:15,911
Mm

346
00:25:17,115 --> 00:25:18,446
Your gear

347
00:25:20,385 --> 00:25:22,148
Wherever 2 or more
are gathered in my name

348
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:28,858
Shut up

349
00:25:30,595 --> 00:25:31,721
Oleg

350
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,728
Oleg. Come on

351
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,526
Mind your own business, bitch

352
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:03,918
Bobby

353
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,395
He's gonna be dead in a minute

354
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:39,121
Hi

355
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:40,891
Hey

356
00:26:46,972 --> 00:26:47,939
You know Bobby, I have never seen you

357
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:51,042
stick up for anyone but yourself before

358
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:54,404
I have to admit, the kid
was pretty impressed, too

359
00:26:56,081 --> 00:26:57,673
I don't know much about kids

360
00:26:57,816 --> 00:26:59,147
That's too bad

361
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:00,410
cause he's yours

362
00:28:06,117 --> 00:28:08,381
Big, bad Boom Boom

363
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:10,844
How's the meth business

364
00:28:11,556 --> 00:28:13,217
This is my business

365
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:14,188
Maybe you didn't see
the sign on your way in

366
00:28:14,325 --> 00:28:16,520
I'm a tattoo artist

367
00:28:16,661 --> 00:28:18,151
(speaks Spanish)

368
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:19,587
Easy, baby

369
00:28:20,665 --> 00:28:22,132
Don't go nowhere

370
00:28:22,267 --> 00:28:24,235
I'm not gonna bite ya

371
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:26,359
I got a tip for ya

372
00:28:28,106 --> 00:28:30,074
About the guy that did Maddog

373
00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:32,639
Tim Kearney

374
00:28:32,777 --> 00:28:34,802
Mm-hm. Yeah

375
00:28:34,946 --> 00:28:36,413
You and your brothers
been looking for him

376
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:38,015
but you can't find him, can ya

377
00:28:40,518 --> 00:28:41,712
He'll turn up

378
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:43,946
Feds still got him in protective custody

379
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:45,317
Oh no

380
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:46,515
He's out

381
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:51,023
If I was you, I'd
start looking down around the border

382
00:28:51,596 --> 00:28:52,858
Excuse me

383
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:55,591
What's your play in this

384
00:28:56,334 --> 00:28:57,995
Oh, didn't I tell ya

385
00:28:59,204 --> 00:29:01,297
I'm the one that turned him loose

386
00:29:07,545 --> 00:29:09,172
I could do a car bomb

387
00:29:09,647 --> 00:29:12,707
take your legs off, right at the knees

388
00:29:14,285 --> 00:29:15,582
I bet you could

389
00:29:19,724 --> 00:29:22,158
Just cause we doin' business
don't mean you got rights

390
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:24,818
Come on. Come on, please

391
00:29:25,363 --> 00:29:27,126
What the hell do you want, Grusza

392
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:30,564
Let's just say Kearney being released
is a case of misplaced trust

393
00:29:31,536 --> 00:29:34,664
Drop him off in a body bag
I'll pretend it was Santa Claus

394
00:29:34,806 --> 00:29:36,239
and that'll be that

395
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:38,336
Adios

396
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,420
So the boy's mine

397
00:30:32,463 --> 00:30:33,555
That's right

398
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:36,565
She never told me about him

399
00:30:37,802 --> 00:30:40,100
Yeah. Well you'd have
to be around for that

400
00:30:51,983 --> 00:30:53,245
So does everybody know

401
00:30:53,384 --> 00:30:54,646
Hm-mm

402
00:30:54,786 --> 00:30:56,583
Just Olivia and me

403
00:30:56,721 --> 00:30:57,653
Now you

404
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:00,752
Olivia asked me not to tell you

405
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:04,253
So why did ya

406
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:06,128
'Cause you should know

407
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:11,268
It's been a long time, Bobby

408
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:14,629
Yeah, too long

409
00:31:14,772 --> 00:31:15,602
Yeah

410
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:19,167
So what brought you back

411
00:31:21,746 --> 00:31:22,940
Was it the money

412
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:26,380
Still want my share

413
00:31:28,586 --> 00:31:30,213
I hadn't forgotten about you

414
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:31,413
Mm

415
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:34,191
You're giving me what's mine

416
00:31:36,628 --> 00:31:37,959
Yeah, of course

417
00:31:44,168 --> 00:31:45,931
You really have changed, Bobby

418
00:31:48,106 --> 00:31:49,073
How

419
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:53,670
Well, in the old days

420
00:31:55,346 --> 00:31:57,712
you would've definitely
had me in bed by now

421
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,089
Let's do it my way

422
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:11,024
You haven't forgotten
my favorite position, have you

423
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:20,535
No
No

424
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:39,750
Do you remember our first time

425
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:44,357
In my little trailer at El Morro Beach

426
00:32:47,231 --> 00:32:49,290
It's still there, if you need it

427
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:55,901
Thanks

428
00:32:56,874 --> 00:32:58,808
Noncommittal as ever

429
00:33:10,521 --> 00:33:11,681
Was I bad to you

430
00:33:18,629 --> 00:33:20,563
Yeah. Yeah Bobby, you were

431
00:33:24,435 --> 00:33:26,164
Have you talked to Monk lately

432
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:30,071
No

433
00:33:30,975 --> 00:33:32,101
You

434
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:34,171
Once in a while

435
00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:36,937
He still dreams of having me someday

436
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:40,446
So long as that dream
is alive I'll get what I want

437
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,082
You need his number

438
00:33:47,725 --> 00:33:48,987
No, I have it

439
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:58,532
You better get going

440
00:34:00,471 --> 00:34:01,631
Why

441
00:34:03,741 --> 00:34:06,301
'Cause when Don Huertero gets here
he's gonna kill you

442
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:10,673
How do you know that

443
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:13,843
You know Brian

444
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:15,680
Yap, yap, yap

445
00:34:42,346 --> 00:34:43,813
Can I come with you? Please

446
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:46,806
Listen. Please

447
00:34:46,951 --> 00:34:47,815
No, go back in your bedroom

448
00:34:47,952 --> 00:34:49,783
Please. Can I come with you

449
00:34:50,488 --> 00:34:51,785
Hey, I don't know much about kids

450
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:53,857
That's too bad, 'cause he's yours

451
00:34:53,991 --> 00:34:55,618
Beautiful, beautiful boy

452
00:34:59,664 --> 00:35:00,858
Where do you think you're going, son

453
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:04,659
I'm leaving

454
00:35:04,802 --> 00:35:05,860
What, are you gonna shoot me

455
00:35:06,404 --> 00:35:07,735
You're not the type

456
00:35:22,386 --> 00:35:24,718
Stop him! Bring him back

457
00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:39,332
Come on

458
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:45,099
He's getting away

459
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:47,172
After him

460
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:56,515
Get him! Go

461
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,425
Alright get off. Hide

462
00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:38,790
Hah! Hah

463
00:38:05,216 --> 00:38:06,308
You came back

464
00:38:08,252 --> 00:38:09,344
Yeah, I'm not too bright

465
00:38:36,113 --> 00:38:38,013
He's heading south
by southwest, Mr. Johnson

466
00:38:40,551 --> 00:38:41,381
Let's go

467
00:38:45,589 --> 00:38:46,851
H'yah, h'yah

468
00:39:16,253 --> 00:39:17,117
Are we out of gas

469
00:39:18,589 --> 00:39:19,783
Yeah, we're out of gas

470
00:39:20,391 --> 00:39:21,756
Son of a bitch

471
00:39:27,565 --> 00:39:28,623
What're we gonna do

472
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:32,063
Alright, alright
we're gonna play a game now

473
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,135
What game

474
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,234
You know what a marine is

475
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:38,706
Kind of soldier

476
00:39:38,843 --> 00:39:39,434
No

477
00:39:39,577 --> 00:39:40,942
Marine is a bad ass

478
00:39:41,078 --> 00:39:42,170
You wanna play that game

479
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:43,245
No

480
00:39:44,014 --> 00:39:44,981
Why not

481
00:39:45,116 --> 00:39:46,743
Navy Seals are tougher

482
00:39:51,856 --> 00:39:52,823
Okay

483
00:39:52,957 --> 00:39:54,788
So we're gonna play Navy Seals

484
00:39:54,925 --> 00:39:56,722
and we're goin' on a secret mission

485
00:39:56,861 --> 00:39:58,954
And we're gonna go up
over that mountain over there

486
00:39:59,096 --> 00:40:00,222
That's so gay

487
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:04,201
You know the truth of the matter is man

488
00:40:04,335 --> 00:40:06,326
I don't really give a shit
what we play right now

489
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:08,301
but if we don't play something
they're gonna shoot you

490
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:09,804
Don't scream at me

491
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:10,599
You know, forget about it

492
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:11,673
Let's just go. That was stupid

493
00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:12,798
Let's go, come on. Move it

494
00:40:12,943 --> 00:40:14,035
What

495
00:40:14,178 --> 00:40:15,577
we're gonna walk

496
00:40:15,713 --> 00:40:19,205
No, I just called for a limousineman
It's gonna be here in fifteen minutes

497
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:20,910
Move out

498
00:40:21,051 --> 00:40:22,040
God

499
00:40:27,892 --> 00:40:29,792
See, you wouldn't 've made
a very good marine anyhow

500
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:30,951
Whatever

501
00:40:37,368 --> 00:40:38,858
Why are you doing this to me

502
00:40:41,205 --> 00:40:42,069
We were friends

503
00:40:42,206 --> 00:40:43,195
You've ruined everything

504
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:46,104
You've put my job in jeopardy

505
00:40:48,746 --> 00:40:49,770
Where was Bobby going

506
00:40:49,914 --> 00:40:51,176
I don't know

507
00:40:51,315 --> 00:40:53,840
You know what, I almost believe you

508
00:40:53,984 --> 00:40:55,451
But Don Huertero won't

509
00:40:55,586 --> 00:40:57,554
He might

510
00:40:57,688 --> 00:40:58,746
You know what

511
00:41:00,191 --> 00:41:01,021
He won't

512
00:41:01,158 --> 00:41:02,216
And it's gonna be better for me

513
00:41:02,359 --> 00:41:04,793
if it looks like
I tried harder to find out

514
00:41:10,568 --> 00:41:12,229
Just not my face, okay

515
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:34,920
What's that

516
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:36,390
What
Listen

517
00:41:36,527 --> 00:41:37,687
What
Sh

518
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:42,862
Can you hear it

519
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:49,970
Run! Run

520
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:51,971
I got 'em, Johnson

521
00:41:52,109 --> 00:41:55,135
They're a half a mile due west
heading into Cable Rock

522
00:41:55,546 --> 00:41:57,241
Come on, go! Run

523
00:42:02,486 --> 00:42:03,248
Run! Run

524
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:09,386
Come on! Stop looking

525
00:42:10,561 --> 00:42:11,585
Don't slow down

526
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:17,997
Go go go

527
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:29,841
They're all yours, boys

528
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:31,504
Bring him back alive

529
00:42:31,649 --> 00:42:32,775
Stay outta sight

530
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:39,856
We're alright

531
00:42:49,133 --> 00:42:50,157
You miss your mom

532
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:51,799
Yeah

533
00:42:52,336 --> 00:42:53,928
But I like it better with Elizabeth

534
00:42:55,105 --> 00:42:56,003
And why's that

535
00:42:56,674 --> 00:42:58,073
She's not a drug addict

536
00:43:03,547 --> 00:43:04,514
That's good

537
00:43:05,683 --> 00:43:06,809
That's real good

538
00:43:12,489 --> 00:43:16,687
Alright kid, I'm proud of you
but this is go-time right now

539
00:43:17,227 --> 00:43:19,491
This is serious and I need you
to listen to me, Alright

540
00:43:20,564 --> 00:43:22,623
Those bad guys, they're right behind us

541
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:24,256
They're gonna be here any minute

542
00:43:24,401 --> 00:43:26,266
So when they get here
I'm gonna signal you

543
00:43:26,403 --> 00:43:29,133
and I want you to hide
behind those two rocks right there

544
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:31,241
Alright, you see those rocks

545
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:33,668
Okay

546
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:42,980
There is no way some candyass
surfer from Laguna Beach

547
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,020
knows his way around a desert like this

548
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:56,188
H'yah! H'yah

549
00:44:22,459 --> 00:44:23,357
Shit

550
00:44:26,597 --> 00:44:27,655
Get behind the rock

551
00:44:27,798 --> 00:44:29,060
Hide behind that rock

552
00:45:11,275 --> 00:45:12,572
I'm gonna cut you up, boy

553
00:45:13,844 --> 00:45:14,868
Come on, cowboy

554
00:45:15,446 --> 00:45:16,071
Come on

555
00:45:29,827 --> 00:45:30,759
Shit

556
00:46:16,874 --> 00:46:20,310
C'mon! Go go go!
C'mon, go, run! Run, c'mon

557
00:46:24,248 --> 00:46:26,239
I got you now, you son of a bitch

558
00:46:28,218 --> 00:46:29,150
Ah, shit

559
00:46:30,888 --> 00:46:32,446
Run your ass off

560
00:46:32,589 --> 00:46:33,851
C'mon, c'mon

561
00:46:34,591 --> 00:46:36,559
God damn horse

562
00:46:39,163 --> 00:46:41,996
Look, I know this looks bad
but I can explain everything

563
00:46:58,415 --> 00:47:01,873
He killed your men and escaped
even from you Mr. Johnson

564
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,254
Let Brian cook in the sun for a while

565
00:47:07,457 --> 00:47:09,448
Mr. Johnson, follow me

566
00:47:11,461 --> 00:47:13,292
Brian is a cowardly degenerate

567
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:16,263
who gallantly seeks to place
the blame on sweet Elizabeth

568
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,164
He tells me that she warned Mr. Z
about my plans for him

569
00:47:19,303 --> 00:47:21,669
If that's true, and perhaps it is

570
00:47:22,669 --> 00:47:32,669
