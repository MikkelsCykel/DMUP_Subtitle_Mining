1
00:00:39,856 --> 00:00:41,882
The reason for calling
this conference

2
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:45,553
at this particular moment
is that we are convinced

3
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:49,155
that we have overcome
a major financial crisis,

4
00:00:49,232 --> 00:00:51,166
a crisis in severity

5
00:00:51,234 --> 00:00:53,862
unparalleled in
the history of the world,

6
00:00:53,937 --> 00:00:55,871
and that with
its relaxation,

7
00:00:55,939 --> 00:00:59,033
confidence and hope have
reappeared in the world.

8
00:00:59,108 --> 00:01:02,566
# <i>Happy days are here again</i>

9
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:05,113
# <i>The skies above are clear again</i>

10
00:01:05,181 --> 00:01:07,240
<i>All anybody</i>
<i>talked about back then</i>

11
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:10,115
<i>was the Great Depression,</i>
<i>how bad things were,</i>

12
00:01:10,186 --> 00:01:13,019
<i>and how the good times had</i>
<i>to be just around the corner. </i>

13
00:01:14,424 --> 00:01:17,416
<i>I must have worn out every corner</i>
<i>in Waycross, Georgia,</i>

14
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:20,190
<i>looking for those good times</i>
<i>before realizing</i>

15
00:01:20,263 --> 00:01:22,754
<i>my destiny lay somewhere else,</i>

16
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:25,266
<i>anywhere else. </i>

17
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:28,827
# <i>Happy days are here again</i>

18
00:01:28,905 --> 00:01:31,931
# <i>Your cares and troubles are gone</i>

19
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:36,911
# <i>There will be no more</i>
<i>from now on</i>

20
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:40,347
# <i>Happy days are here again</i>

21
00:01:40,416 --> 00:01:43,852
# <i>The skies above are clear again</i>

22
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,448
# <i>Let us sing a song</i>
<i>of cheer again... </i>

23
00:01:49,792 --> 00:01:52,886
Ready, Sonora? You don't
want to be late for school.

24
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:55,427
Be right there.

25
00:02:03,606 --> 00:02:06,769
- Arnette, where's your sister?
- She's comin', Aunt Helen.

26
00:02:06,843 --> 00:02:09,835
Sonora, you better
quit lollygaggin'.

27
00:02:24,694 --> 00:02:27,720
Sonora, what are ya doin'?

28
00:02:33,369 --> 00:02:35,360
What have you done?

29
00:02:35,438 --> 00:02:38,373
My God, girl!
What am I gonna do with you?

30
00:02:38,441 --> 00:02:41,638
- I'll teach you.
- No, Aunt Helen!

31
00:02:41,711 --> 00:02:44,305
You're gonna wear it,
and that's final.

32
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,678
No more back talk,
or I'll smack your face.

33
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:50,344
Get out of here.
I don't even want to look at you.

34
00:03:12,075 --> 00:03:14,839
Come here, Lightning.
What's wrong?

35
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:20,513
Whoa. Easy.

36
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:23,211
Hold still.
Let me get...

37
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:25,254
There.

38
00:03:25,321 --> 00:03:28,813
There you go.
That's better, huh, boy?

39
00:03:28,891 --> 00:03:31,826
Isn't that sweet?
Nice haircut, Sonora.

40
00:03:31,894 --> 00:03:34,829
Who cut it? A blind man
with a butcher knife?

41
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:38,533
That's the ugliest haircut I've seen.

42
00:03:38,601 --> 00:03:42,560
Ugly. She should look in the mirror.
Come on, Lightning.

43
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:45,199
Where you taking him?
To the glue factory?

44
00:03:45,274 --> 00:03:47,799
He's the best horse
in the county.

45
00:03:47,877 --> 00:03:49,811
- I bet.
- Oh, yeah.

46
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:53,975
He is. Lightning can outrun
or outjump any horse around.

47
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:56,917
Can he jump that fence over there?

48
00:03:59,389 --> 00:04:02,552
- He can jump twice that high.
- Prove it.

49
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:05,788
I would, but I don't want
to be late for school.

50
00:04:05,862 --> 00:04:07,989
You're just a 'fraidy cat.

51
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:10,225
You're just scared.

52
00:04:10,299 --> 00:04:12,961
Go on. Do it.
I dare you.

53
00:04:15,571 --> 00:04:17,801
I double dare you.

54
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:21,503
Okay, you just watch.

55
00:04:26,883 --> 00:04:30,341
I think my big mouth
just got us into trouble.

56
00:04:38,961 --> 00:04:41,088
Come on, Lightning.
Come on.

57
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:48,667
Come on.

58
00:04:48,738 --> 00:04:50,968
- Will she make it?
- She's gonna do it.

59
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,565
Come on, Lightning.

60
00:04:55,445 --> 00:04:57,379
Ooh!

61
00:05:05,621 --> 00:05:07,851
Let's get out of here!

62
00:05:10,159 --> 00:05:12,252
Wait. Get back.

63
00:05:14,363 --> 00:05:15,887
Help!

64
00:05:15,965 --> 00:05:19,230
The noun
of the sentence is "boy. "

65
00:05:19,302 --> 00:05:22,237
The verb of the sentence is...

66
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:26,432
You're late, Sonora.

67
00:05:27,977 --> 00:05:30,377
I'm very sorry, Miss Simpson.

68
00:05:30,446 --> 00:05:33,040
You're getting detention for this.

69
00:05:34,016 --> 00:05:36,211
It's not my fault.
The cows got out, and I...

70
00:05:36,285 --> 00:05:39,721
I don't want to hear any excuses.
Take your seat.

71
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:42,380
Yes, ma'am.

72
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:44,050
Moo!

73
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:50,725
Class!

74
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,463
Class! Quiet! Quiet!

75
00:05:55,538 --> 00:05:57,699
Clarabelle, oh, my...

76
00:05:58,541 --> 00:05:59,769
Sonora,

77
00:05:59,842 --> 00:06:02,436
leave this room immediately.

78
00:06:02,512 --> 00:06:06,312
Young lady, remove yourself.
You must leave.

79
00:06:23,766 --> 00:06:27,759
Sonora Webster is officially
suspended from school

80
00:06:27,837 --> 00:06:30,101
for one week.

81
00:06:30,173 --> 00:06:33,973
I'm informing your aunt.
No one talks to her.

82
00:06:36,779 --> 00:06:38,838
She's not here!

83
00:07:24,427 --> 00:07:28,090
Two red ones
and a green one.

84
00:07:28,164 --> 00:07:30,724
No, ma'am,
please, right here.

85
00:07:35,471 --> 00:07:39,339
Sonora, tell your aunt
that blue thread she wanted

86
00:07:39,408 --> 00:07:41,672
will be here
in a couple of days.

87
00:07:41,744 --> 00:07:43,075
Okay, I will.

88
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,704
- Here you go, Arnette.
- Thank you.

89
00:07:47,783 --> 00:07:51,241
Oh, Sonora. I'm goin' over
to see Sarah. I'll see you at home.

90
00:07:59,929 --> 00:08:04,662
"Young girl...
... diving horses...

91
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:08,568
...willing to travel. "

92
00:08:16,045 --> 00:08:18,036
Thank you, ma'am.

93
00:08:19,782 --> 00:08:21,443
- You ready?
- Let's get.

94
00:08:25,454 --> 00:08:28,651
What's going on?
What are you doing with Lightning?

95
00:08:28,724 --> 00:08:31,386
- I sold him.
- No, you can't!

96
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:35,157
Why? Why are you doing this?
I didn't do anything wrong.

97
00:08:35,231 --> 00:08:38,428
- You let the cows out.
- That was an accident.

98
00:08:38,501 --> 00:08:40,366
You got suspended from school.

99
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:43,735
Since your mama and daddy died,
you've been nothing but trouble.

100
00:08:43,806 --> 00:08:46,434
Lightning, wait! Let me go!

101
00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:09,297
Sonora?

102
00:09:09,365 --> 00:09:12,129
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

103
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:17,464
Sonora, I took you and Arnette in

104
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,770
because you're
my sister's children.

105
00:09:19,842 --> 00:09:23,642
But ever since you came here,
you've been nothing but a burden.

106
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:29,751
There's a depression going on,
there's extra mouths to feed...

107
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:33,220
So I've decided I'm going to
turn you over to the state.

108
00:09:35,424 --> 00:09:36,857
The state?

109
00:09:36,926 --> 00:09:41,488
They'll feed you and take care of you
until you come of age.

110
00:09:45,234 --> 00:09:48,226
You're just gonna
kick me and Arnette out?

111
00:09:48,804 --> 00:09:52,865
No, Arnette's gonna stay here with me.
It's just gonna be you.

112
00:09:55,778 --> 00:09:57,837
You're goin' tomorrow, you hear?

113
00:10:01,951 --> 00:10:04,181
Yes, ma'am.

114
00:10:06,455 --> 00:10:10,118
Come on, now,
and help me with supper.

115
00:11:33,342 --> 00:11:36,072
Everything you got. Ohh!

116
00:11:49,358 --> 00:11:51,349
Ah!

117
00:11:53,662 --> 00:11:57,655
Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight!

118
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:04,301
Come on. I thought this
was going to be a friendly game.

119
00:12:04,373 --> 00:12:08,036
You're hiding an ace in your hat,
and we're gonna find it.

120
00:12:15,384 --> 00:12:18,182
You better say your prayers.

121
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,427
Looks like I was wrong.
Let him go.

122
00:12:29,298 --> 00:12:30,629
I apologize.

123
00:12:31,433 --> 00:12:33,264
You crumpled my hat.

124
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,998
But that's okay.
I like it like this.

125
00:12:37,072 --> 00:12:39,063
I'll see you, fellas.

126
00:12:47,249 --> 00:12:50,241
Get your balloons.
Balloon on a stick right here.

127
00:12:50,319 --> 00:12:52,753
A nickel apiece.
Any color of the rainbow.

128
00:12:59,395 --> 00:13:02,762
Ow! Son of a monkey.
Dern fire.

129
00:13:02,831 --> 00:13:05,527
- Dang!
- Here. Let me help.

130
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:13,471
Never had a girl
spit on me before.

131
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:17,205
This'll take the sting out.
Mud'll keep it from blistering.

132
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,009
I guess selling hot dogs
can be a dangerous job.

133
00:13:20,082 --> 00:13:22,880
This? This isn't my job.

134
00:13:22,952 --> 00:13:25,887
This is temporary
until I get my act going.

135
00:13:25,955 --> 00:13:28,423
- What kind of act?
- I'm not sure exactly.

136
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:31,721
I'm still experimenting,
but it will be death-defying.

137
00:13:31,794 --> 00:13:34,524
It will definitely defy death.

138
00:13:34,597 --> 00:13:38,089
- There you go. Feel better?
- Uh-huh.

139
00:13:39,368 --> 00:13:41,734
Sure is a funny way
of cooking hot dogs.

140
00:13:41,804 --> 00:13:44,329
It's my own invention.
Do you want one?

141
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:47,398
- I don't have any money.
- Well, that's okay.

142
00:13:47,476 --> 00:13:50,070
It's on the house,
for fixing my finger.

143
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:53,040
I'm Clifford Henderson.

144
00:13:53,115 --> 00:13:55,310
Sonora. Sonora Webster.

145
00:13:55,384 --> 00:13:57,375
It's good to meet ya.

146
00:14:01,023 --> 00:14:03,890
Would you know where I can
find a Dr. W.F. Carver?

147
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:06,484
Right through there,
across the fairgrounds.

148
00:14:06,562 --> 00:14:08,496
Thank you.

149
00:14:08,564 --> 00:14:11,226
Thanks for the hot dog.
Take care of that finger.

150
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:14,201
Thanks for spitting on me.

151
00:14:53,042 --> 00:14:56,739
- That's the last thing I want to do.
- I got a show to run, Al.

152
00:14:56,812 --> 00:15:00,111
- So I missed a couple.
- Couple? You missed three.

153
00:15:00,182 --> 00:15:03,310
Chasing women and gambling
are more important than your job?

154
00:15:03,385 --> 00:15:04,909
No, but it's a lot more fun.

155
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:07,387
Here, Dad,
add that to your profits.

156
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:13,484
Get out of here, son.
Load the truck.

157
00:15:34,983 --> 00:15:36,814
Dr. Carver?

158
00:15:37,953 --> 00:15:41,912
This is your lucky day.
You don't need this anymore.

159
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:43,855
I'm here to answer your ad.

160
00:15:43,926 --> 00:15:46,053
Who are you?

161
00:15:47,096 --> 00:15:49,189
Your new diving girl.

162
00:15:49,264 --> 00:15:51,289
No, you're not.

163
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,998
- Why not?
- For one thing, I don't like you.

164
00:15:57,072 --> 00:15:59,540
That's because
you don't know me.

165
00:15:59,608 --> 00:16:01,940
Secondly,
you're interrupting my business.

166
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:03,807
Third and most important,

167
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:06,973
you're too young
and too puny to be a diving girl.

168
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:10,075
Well, sir, I don't know what
a diving girl does exactly,

169
00:16:10,152 --> 00:16:14,111
but I can do it,
'cause I can do anything.

170
00:16:14,189 --> 00:16:17,090
Good. You can
get out of here.

171
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:36,405
I am a very busy man.

172
00:16:36,478 --> 00:16:40,141
I do not have time
to play with children.

173
00:16:41,517 --> 00:16:43,712
Now, will you get off that chair?

174
00:16:43,786 --> 00:16:47,085
Not until you give me a chance.
I only want a chance.

175
00:16:47,156 --> 00:16:49,818
Let me explain something to you.

176
00:16:49,892 --> 00:16:52,884
A diving girl has to be strong.

177
00:16:52,961 --> 00:16:55,759
A diving girl
has to be brave, fearless,

178
00:16:55,831 --> 00:16:57,890
a showman.

179
00:17:03,338 --> 00:17:05,806
Now, there...

180
00:17:05,874 --> 00:17:07,933
...is a diving girl.

181
00:17:09,011 --> 00:17:11,036
You gotta have more...

182
00:17:12,481 --> 00:17:15,177
You gotta have more
than what you got.

183
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,514
Well, I'll get it.

184
00:17:20,656 --> 00:17:22,146
What's your name?

185
00:17:23,592 --> 00:17:25,924
Sonora. Sonora Webster.

186
00:17:25,994 --> 00:17:28,258
Let me tell you something.
Tell you what you do.

187
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:31,493
You go out that door,
cross the fairgrounds,

188
00:17:31,567 --> 00:17:34,058
turn left at the gate,
keep walking

189
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:36,127
until you get
to the bus station.

190
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:42,677
I'm not gonna leave
until you give me a job.

191
00:17:45,948 --> 00:17:48,041
Have a good trip.

192
00:18:02,397 --> 00:18:04,388
Al?

193
00:18:07,302 --> 00:18:11,102
- Dr. Carver sent me to see you.
- Oh, he did?

194
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:14,631
Yeah, I just had
a really nice talk with him,

195
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:16,974
and he thinks I'd make
a perfect diving girl.

196
00:18:17,045 --> 00:18:19,275
- That's what he said, huh?
- Uh-huh.

197
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:22,374
And he said you're supposed
to explain the show to me.

198
00:18:22,451 --> 00:18:24,112
Sure. Come on.

199
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,255
The show is real exciting.

200
00:18:28,323 --> 00:18:30,314
And that's the tower.

201
00:18:33,829 --> 00:18:35,820
Okay. Fine.

202
00:18:35,898 --> 00:18:38,458
Thank you very much. Oh.

203
00:18:41,236 --> 00:18:43,727
You dropped this.

204
00:18:49,144 --> 00:18:51,942
So, now I'm a baby-sitter.

205
00:18:54,116 --> 00:18:56,107
You're not afraid
of heights, are ya?

206
00:18:56,184 --> 00:18:58,243
Who, me? No.

207
00:19:07,329 --> 00:19:10,423
- How do you get the horses to jump?
- We train 'em.

208
00:19:10,499 --> 00:19:12,797
- Don't they get scared?
- Nope.

209
00:19:12,868 --> 00:19:15,928
If they show any fear,
we don't let them near the tower.

210
00:19:16,004 --> 00:19:18,199
What do you do,
push them off?

211
00:19:18,273 --> 00:19:20,764
No, they jump on their own.

212
00:19:20,842 --> 00:19:23,367
And we don't use
any kind of devices, either.

213
00:19:23,445 --> 00:19:26,972
- Do the horses ever get hurt?
- Nope, just the riders.

214
00:19:28,817 --> 00:19:32,412
It's rough. You travel from
town to town, barely getting by.

215
00:19:32,487 --> 00:19:36,014
The old man, he's tough.
He'll push you till you break.

216
00:19:40,062 --> 00:19:43,896
Go back to wherever you came from.
You don't want to be a diving girl.

217
00:20:02,317 --> 00:20:04,911
<i>I have a glorious idea</i>
<i>for a new poster. </i>

218
00:20:04,987 --> 00:20:08,013
Full-length shot of me,
standing next to the horse,

219
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:10,490
and in the corner,
inside an oval frame,

220
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,424
a picture of my face.

221
00:20:12,494 --> 00:20:15,019
- Smiling.
- I'll think about it, Marie.

222
00:20:15,097 --> 00:20:17,531
I know it'd sell lots of tickets.

223
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:19,794
Maybe the Movietone people
will come by,

224
00:20:19,868 --> 00:20:22,063
take a moving picture
of me diving.

225
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:24,401
- I'll think about it, Marie.
- Hi!

226
00:20:25,207 --> 00:20:27,402
We're not buying pencils today,
thank you.

227
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:29,535
Did you miss your bus?

228
00:20:29,611 --> 00:20:32,774
I told you I wasn't going
to leave until you gave me a job.

229
00:20:32,848 --> 00:20:35,783
This young lady
wants to be a diving girl.

230
00:20:35,851 --> 00:20:39,617
That's a wonderful idea.
She could bring glamour to the act.

231
00:20:44,526 --> 00:20:49,225
- What you doin'?
- This way he gets used to my smell.

232
00:20:49,297 --> 00:20:51,390
That's right.

233
00:20:51,466 --> 00:20:53,957
Indians used to do that on the plains.

234
00:20:54,036 --> 00:20:55,970
- Really?
- Hmm.

235
00:20:56,038 --> 00:20:58,131
I thought I just made that up.

236
00:20:58,206 --> 00:21:00,174
Can you handle a wheelbarrow?

237
00:21:00,242 --> 00:21:03,211
Are you kidding?
I was born handling a wheelbarrow.

238
00:21:03,278 --> 00:21:07,977
- Can you shovel manure?
- Manure happens to be my "speciality. "

239
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:10,348
I believe that.
What about your family?

240
00:21:10,419 --> 00:21:13,388
- They lookin' for you?
- Nope.

241
00:21:13,455 --> 00:21:16,424
I'm not gonna give you
a job as a diving girl.

242
00:21:16,491 --> 00:21:19,551
But we're leaving
tomorrow for Virginia.

243
00:21:19,628 --> 00:21:22,654
I could use a good stable hand.
You interested?

244
00:21:22,731 --> 00:21:25,359
- Yeah! Let's go to Virginia.
- All right.

245
00:21:34,009 --> 00:21:37,342
<i>Virginia. </i>
<i>I couldn't believe my luck. </i>

246
00:21:37,412 --> 00:21:40,108
<i>I'd never been</i>
<i>to another state before. </i>

247
00:21:40,182 --> 00:21:42,742
<i>I was really seeing the world now,</i>

248
00:21:42,818 --> 00:21:46,720
<i>even if my view was more where</i>
<i>we'd been than where we were goin'.</i>

249
00:21:46,788 --> 00:21:48,722
<i>But I wasn't gonna complain. </i>

250
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:50,690
<i>I finally had a real job,</i>

251
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:53,694
<i>helping Dr. Carver with the horses</i>
<i>during the off-season</i>

252
00:21:53,762 --> 00:21:55,696
<i>at the farm he rented. </i>

253
00:21:55,764 --> 00:21:59,029
<i>I was gonna be staying in the</i>
<i>most beautiful house I'd ever seen. </i>

254
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:02,366
<i>Things were looking up. </i>

255
00:22:02,437 --> 00:22:05,565
<i>From here on, my life</i>
<i>was gonna be just swell. </i>

256
00:22:07,342 --> 00:22:09,902
You wouldn't mind
giving me a hand, would you?

257
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,971
Come on.
We gotta get them horses ready.

258
00:22:14,049 --> 00:22:16,540
Hurry up. Everybody's
a cow tail around here.

259
00:22:16,618 --> 00:22:21,681
We got a lot of work to do.
Lord knows, we'll take the bunch.

260
00:22:30,298 --> 00:22:32,596
It's okay.
I got everything under control.

261
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:34,599
Sonora!

262
00:22:35,237 --> 00:22:37,228
Come get this horse, please.

263
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:44,435
Wash him down.
Make sure he's dry.

264
00:22:44,513 --> 00:22:46,674
Think you can manage that?

265
00:22:49,684 --> 00:22:51,709
Yoo-hoo! Hi, Al.

266
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:54,312
How ya doing?

267
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:57,417
Whoa, Red Lips.

268
00:22:57,492 --> 00:22:59,892
- Easy, whoa!
- Hold him! Hold him!

269
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:02,657
Hold the horse.
Marie, come get this horse.

270
00:23:02,731 --> 00:23:05,859
Get him in his stable.
Get him in there.

271
00:23:05,934 --> 00:23:09,301
If you can't handle the animal,
don't go near him.

272
00:23:12,007 --> 00:23:14,100
Nice horse, huh?

273
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:17,077
That horse is spooked.
Where'd ya get him?

274
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:20,376
I won him in a poker game.
Full house, queens over threes.

275
00:23:20,448 --> 00:23:23,940
- Looks loco to me.
- All he needs is training.

276
00:23:24,019 --> 00:23:26,715
Do what you want.
Just keep him away from people.

277
00:23:26,788 --> 00:23:29,086
I don't want anybody hurt.

278
00:23:32,694 --> 00:23:34,286
Come on.

279
00:23:34,362 --> 00:23:36,592
Just one little bite. Come on.

280
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:38,792
Come on.

281
00:23:38,867 --> 00:23:42,496
I better get to know these horses
if I'm gonna be a diving girl.

282
00:23:42,571 --> 00:23:44,300
Think you can do it?

283
00:23:44,372 --> 00:23:47,273
Sure, if Dr. Carver
gives me a chance.

284
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:51,301
He's not going to give you
a chance, unless...

285
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:55,710
If you rode up
on this horse, he might.

286
00:23:57,185 --> 00:24:00,120
- We could train him.
- What are we waiting for?

287
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:04,284
No, not now. We'll go out
first thing in the morning.

288
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:07,624
- All right.
- The old man can't know.

289
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:10,494
- It'll be our secret.
- Okay.

290
00:24:24,412 --> 00:24:27,313
Psst. Al, get up.

291
00:24:29,417 --> 00:24:32,215
Al, we're supposed
to start training!

292
00:24:32,287 --> 00:24:34,278
What?

293
00:24:35,924 --> 00:24:37,983
Oh, right.

294
00:24:42,597 --> 00:24:45,122
Give him some room.

295
00:24:51,139 --> 00:24:53,767
- Easy, boy.
- Whoa.

296
00:24:55,377 --> 00:24:57,345
Easy, boy.

297
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:59,471
Whoa, whoa. Whoa!

298
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:04,551
Good boy. Whoa.

299
00:25:04,619 --> 00:25:07,053
What's this horse's name, anyway?

300
00:25:07,122 --> 00:25:09,488
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

301
00:25:09,557 --> 00:25:12,492
- He's gotta have a name.
- How about Clarence?

302
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,926
Clarence?
That's no name for a horse.

303
00:25:14,996 --> 00:25:16,987
You're so smart, you pick it.

304
00:25:18,033 --> 00:25:20,024
<i>Lightning. </i>

305
00:25:21,536 --> 00:25:24,334
Stay behind.
Get your whip on the ground.

306
00:25:24,406 --> 00:25:27,671
Stay behind him.
Come on. Go, go, go.

307
00:25:27,742 --> 00:25:30,643
Come on.
Let him see the whip.

308
00:25:30,712 --> 00:25:32,077
Come on.

309
00:25:36,551 --> 00:25:38,178
Easy, boy.

310
00:25:38,253 --> 00:25:40,744
Here, you take him.

311
00:25:40,822 --> 00:25:43,655
Take that line.

312
00:25:59,407 --> 00:26:01,637
What's your secret wish?

313
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:03,302
My secret wish.

314
00:26:03,378 --> 00:26:06,142
Yeah, what did you
always want to be?

315
00:26:06,214 --> 00:26:10,514
When I was a boy I wanted to be
a showman, just like my dad.

316
00:26:10,585 --> 00:26:12,678
But not anymore.

317
00:26:12,754 --> 00:26:15,245
What do you want to be now?

318
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:18,292
Anything but like him.

319
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,351
What's your secret wish?

320
00:26:20,428 --> 00:26:23,124
To get to Atlantic City,

321
00:26:23,198 --> 00:26:25,598
where all your dreams come true.

322
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:27,601
You believe that?

323
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:30,729
With all my heart.
It says so right here.

324
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:37,468
See?

325
00:26:43,585 --> 00:26:46,418
It's the greatest showplace
in America.

326
00:26:46,488 --> 00:26:49,013
And someday
I'm gonna be there.

327
00:26:54,829 --> 00:26:56,763
<i>What happened</i>
<i>to your parents?</i>

328
00:26:56,831 --> 00:27:00,358
<i>Died. </i>
<i>They got the fever. </i>

329
00:27:00,435 --> 00:27:02,562
<i>What about you?</i>
<i>Where's your mom?</i>

330
00:27:02,637 --> 00:27:04,696
- <i>She's gone. </i>
- <i>Where?</i>

331
00:27:04,773 --> 00:27:07,867
<i>I don't know. </i>
<i>She left a long time ago. </i>

332
00:27:07,942 --> 00:27:10,775
<i>It was my dad. </i>
<i>She left because of him. </i>

333
00:27:10,845 --> 00:27:13,040
Now, just sit there.

334
00:27:13,114 --> 00:27:16,345
- Don't rush it.
- You worry too much.

335
00:27:20,188 --> 00:27:22,418
- Are you hurt?
- No, I'm fine.

336
00:27:24,259 --> 00:27:28,457
He's got ticklish flanks.
You should never use your heels.

337
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:31,499
I figured that out
as I was flying through the air.

338
00:27:33,234 --> 00:27:35,225
He's doing good, though.

339
00:27:36,938 --> 00:27:39,600
So are you.

340
00:27:42,544 --> 00:27:46,742
Come on. We got a lot of work to do
before the old man wakes up.

341
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,844
Nice and easy.

342
00:27:57,192 --> 00:27:59,183
Good boy.

343
00:28:10,038 --> 00:28:12,006
Do you like the movies?

344
00:28:12,073 --> 00:28:15,531
Like them?
I'm gonna be in them someday.

345
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:17,840
How are you gonna do that?

346
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,007
Be discovered, of course.

347
00:28:21,082 --> 00:28:23,277
Diving horses is great exposure.

348
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:27,012
You're pretty enough
to be in the movies.

349
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:31,883
You sure look nice tonight.

350
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:36,488
Thank you. Al's taking me
dancing at the Silver Palm.

351
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:43,203
- Dancing?
- Yes, Al's a terrific dancer.

352
00:28:43,271 --> 00:28:45,637
Smooth as hot honey.

353
00:28:45,707 --> 00:28:47,902
That's nice.

354
00:28:51,212 --> 00:28:52,873
You poor thing.

355
00:28:57,085 --> 00:28:59,280
Who does your hair?

356
00:28:59,354 --> 00:29:01,288
Well, I do.

357
00:29:01,356 --> 00:29:03,984
You should take extreme care
with your appearance.

358
00:29:04,058 --> 00:29:07,186
Having no natural beauty of your own,
you really need to...

359
00:29:07,262 --> 00:29:08,923
...help yourself.

360
00:29:18,806 --> 00:29:20,797
Have a good night.

361
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:25,342
Don't tell me
how to run my business.

362
00:29:25,413 --> 00:29:28,348
All I'm saying is you should
think about selling the show.

363
00:29:28,416 --> 00:29:31,112
Running all over the country
for ten cents a ticket?

364
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:33,279
- Gravy, Al?
- Yeah, sure.

365
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:35,652
It's old and it's tired.
Times have changed.

366
00:29:35,723 --> 00:29:39,056
It's 1932.
We got the Empire State Building,

367
00:29:39,127 --> 00:29:42,460
airplanes crossing the ocean,
women are voting.

368
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:44,555
Is that too much gravy, Al?

369
00:29:44,632 --> 00:29:48,227
This cowboy stuff is old-fashioned,
like that fringe jacket you wear.

370
00:29:48,303 --> 00:29:50,771
That jacket is a gift
from Buffalo Bill Cody.

371
00:29:50,838 --> 00:29:53,705
That's what I mean.
It's from another century.

372
00:30:10,592 --> 00:30:13,254
Would you pass the peas, please?

373
00:30:13,328 --> 00:30:17,230
Sonora, I see you
got your hair... done.

374
00:30:17,298 --> 00:30:19,823
Did you do it yourself?

375
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:23,166
I walked down the road
to the Clip 'n' Curl.

376
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:25,365
Would you pass the peas?

377
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:32,977
Good pork chop, Marie.

378
00:30:38,119 --> 00:30:39,814
Thank you.

379
00:30:39,887 --> 00:30:41,912
You're welcome.

380
00:30:49,397 --> 00:30:53,163
- I like your dress.
- Oh, you scared me.

381
00:30:53,234 --> 00:30:55,395
Sorry.

382
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:57,461
It's a hot night, huh?

383
00:30:57,538 --> 00:30:59,938
Good night to go swimming.

384
00:31:00,008 --> 00:31:02,340
Who? You and Marie?

385
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:04,503
No, you and me.

386
00:31:04,579 --> 00:31:06,513
No, thank you.

387
00:31:06,581 --> 00:31:09,072
Come on.
I know the perfect place.

388
00:31:10,318 --> 00:31:12,309
I'm not going swimming.

389
00:31:20,561 --> 00:31:22,552
Hey.

390
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,025
Come here.

391
00:31:54,295 --> 00:31:56,286
I gotta go. I'm sorry.

392
00:31:56,364 --> 00:31:58,355
- Sonora, wait.
- Sorry.

393
00:31:58,433 --> 00:32:00,867
- Sonora.
- Good night.

394
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:06,531
<i>Roosevelt received</i>
<i>one of the largest demonstrations</i>

395
00:32:06,607 --> 00:32:08,973
<i>ever accorded</i>
<i>a presidential candidate. </i>

396
00:32:09,043 --> 00:32:11,375
<i>And now, let's return</i>

397
00:32:11,446 --> 00:32:13,539

<i>and his orchestra. </i>

398
00:32:13,614 --> 00:32:15,844
Don't drink out of the bottle.

399
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:26,016
You better watch yourself.

400
00:32:26,094 --> 00:32:28,756
What's that supposed to mean?

401
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:30,957
She's young.

402
00:32:32,166 --> 00:32:34,225
She don't know any better.

403
00:32:35,236 --> 00:32:37,796
I don't want you
messing up her life.

404
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:40,636
I haven't done anything.

405
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:42,733
Keep it that way.

406
00:32:47,248 --> 00:32:49,079
Hey!

407
00:32:50,818 --> 00:32:52,547
What?

408
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:54,986
Put the milk away.

409
00:33:13,875 --> 00:33:15,843
Nice day, huh?

410
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,901
Yeah, I suppose so.

411
00:33:24,118 --> 00:33:26,177
Oh, my goodness.
Would you look at that?

412
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:28,279
What do you think you're doing?

413
00:33:28,356 --> 00:33:29,846
Riding.

414
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:32,188
Don't suppose you know
anything about this.

415
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,660
I'm as surprised as you are.

416
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:37,923
All right. So you can ride.

417
00:33:37,999 --> 00:33:40,194
I can dive, too,
if you'd give me a chance.

418
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:41,428
Don't be ridiculous.

419
00:33:41,502 --> 00:33:43,902
She trained that horse.
She deserves a chance.

420
00:33:43,971 --> 00:33:46,735
- Oh, you do, do you?
- Yeah.

421
00:33:46,808 --> 00:33:50,574
- Can you make a moving mount?
- I've never tried.

422
00:33:50,645 --> 00:33:53,637
If you can mount that horse
while he's moving,

423
00:33:53,714 --> 00:33:56,114
I'll let you train to be a diving girl.

424
00:33:56,184 --> 00:33:59,415
It beats shoveling manure.
Come on.

425
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:04,319
Reach out, touch the harness.
Get used to the rhythm.

426
00:34:05,927 --> 00:34:09,419
When he passes, I want you to
grab ahold and pull yourself on.

427
00:34:09,497 --> 00:34:11,624
Concentrate. Here he comes.

428
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:13,530
Get ready.

429
00:34:17,505 --> 00:34:21,498
Whoa. Stay there. Don't move.
Just stay there.

430
00:34:23,845 --> 00:34:26,746
Your nose may be broke.
Does it feel broken?

431
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:30,750
No. But I don't know what
a broken nose feels like.

432
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:32,945
That's enough.
Let's get you in the house.

433
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:35,284
Is that it?

434
00:34:35,356 --> 00:34:38,951
You gonna quit?

435
00:34:39,026 --> 00:34:41,654
Let me look at the nose.

436
00:34:41,729 --> 00:34:43,788
Nose ain't broke. Do it right.

437
00:34:43,865 --> 00:34:46,265
- What? She's not getting...
- Do it again.

438
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:49,701
- She's hurt. She needs to rest.
- Shut your gate.

439
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:52,034
Sonora, you don't have to do this.

440
00:34:52,106 --> 00:34:54,199
It's all right. I can do it.

441
00:35:01,916 --> 00:35:07,445
You don't get anything handed
to you in this world. You gotta earn it.

442
00:35:19,567 --> 00:35:21,228
You gonna cry?

443
00:35:23,137 --> 00:35:25,230
You gonna cry?

444
00:35:27,441 --> 00:35:32,344
- I never cry.
- Good. Let's go.

445
00:35:57,705 --> 00:36:00,572
Don't be in a hurry.
Just sense the horse's rhythm.

446
00:36:08,049 --> 00:36:10,916
- Thattagirl.
- We did it, boy.

447
00:36:10,985 --> 00:36:14,182
- We did it!
- All right. All right.

448
00:36:18,059 --> 00:36:22,894
Okay. Good. Now you can train
to be a diving girl.

449
00:36:22,964 --> 00:36:25,489
Come on down.
Go get cleaned up.

450
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:30,396
What the hell
were you trying to prove?

451
00:36:30,471 --> 00:36:32,735
She did it, didn't she?

452
00:36:32,807 --> 00:36:35,207
You push too hard.

453
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:37,506
Well, she didn't quit.

454
00:36:37,578 --> 00:36:41,207
What? Like me?
Or like my mother?

455
00:36:45,086 --> 00:36:50,080
No matter how hard anyone tries,
it's not good enough, is it?

456
00:36:50,157 --> 00:36:52,717
Stupid old man.

457
00:36:54,929 --> 00:36:56,419
Come on!

458
00:36:56,497 --> 00:37:00,092
- Come on. Come on!
- Al!

459
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:22,350
Al? Al, wait.
Where are you going?

460
00:37:22,423 --> 00:37:25,256
I should have left
a long time ago.

461
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:28,295
I can't keep fighting him.

462
00:37:28,362 --> 00:37:31,456
He doesn't care about me.
He doesn't care about anybody.

463
00:37:31,532 --> 00:37:35,366
The only thing he cares about
is his stupid show.

464
00:37:35,436 --> 00:37:37,563
Please don't go.

465
00:37:45,479 --> 00:37:47,606
I'm sorry.

466
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:55,185
Write me.

467
00:37:56,257 --> 00:37:58,248
I promise.

468
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:29,656
<i>Dear Sonora,</i>

469
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:32,386
<i>I hope you understand</i>
<i>why I had to leave. </i>

470
00:38:33,594 --> 00:38:36,119

- Is that the mail?
- Yeah.

474
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:55,974
Did I get anything?
Any letters?

475
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:57,711
Nope.

476
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:15,902
Get down.
I'll show you how it's done.

477
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:18,302
He's used to me.
I don't think you should ride.

478
00:39:18,372 --> 00:39:21,068
- Don't tell me my business.
- She may have a point.

479
00:39:21,142 --> 00:39:23,372
On the top of her head.
Get down.

480
00:39:30,484 --> 00:39:32,952
Now, just watch.
You'll learn something.

481
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,954
Don't use your heels.

482
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:42,087
- Owww!
- She used her heels.

483
00:39:42,163 --> 00:39:44,723
I hate that horse!

484
00:39:56,410 --> 00:39:58,503
Is it as bad as it sounds?

485
00:39:58,579 --> 00:40:01,047
Marie always did want
to be an actress.

486
00:40:01,115 --> 00:40:03,345
Is she gonna be okay?

487
00:40:03,417 --> 00:40:07,581
She's dislocated her shoulder.
Doctor's putting it in a sling.

488
00:40:08,655 --> 00:40:10,681
I can't take any more of this.

489
00:40:11,926 --> 00:40:14,019
Oh, Lord.

490
00:40:15,362 --> 00:40:18,229
He says she's gonna be
stove-up for six weeks.

491
00:40:18,299 --> 00:40:20,824
- Six weeks?
- Yeah.

492
00:40:20,901 --> 00:40:23,461
We got a bookin'
in three days in North Carolina.

493
00:40:23,537 --> 00:40:26,597
Gee, I wonder where you're
gonna find a diving girl.

494
00:40:33,814 --> 00:40:37,113
Don't worry.
The tower's not as high as it looks.

495
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:39,778
Honest. I've been there.

496
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:43,847
- Hi, remember me?
- Yeah, hot dogs.

497
00:40:43,924 --> 00:40:46,324
Not anymore.
My hot dog stand burned down.

498
00:40:46,393 --> 00:40:48,759
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

499
00:40:48,829 --> 00:40:51,024
Dr. Carver gave me a job.
I'm your new groom.

500
00:40:51,098 --> 00:40:54,192
- Oh, that's great.
- Hey!

501
00:40:54,268 --> 00:40:57,601
- I heard you're diving today.
- My first time off the tower.

502
00:40:57,671 --> 00:40:59,901
- Nervous?
- Who, me?

503
00:40:59,974 --> 00:41:02,534
Nervous? Heck no!

504
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:11,183
Sonora?

505
00:41:11,252 --> 00:41:13,220
- Sonora!
- Come in.

506
00:41:13,287 --> 00:41:16,450
- You all right?
- I'm ready. I feel great.

507
00:41:16,523 --> 00:41:18,457
Good. Good.

508
00:41:18,525 --> 00:41:21,551
The bathing suit doesn't fit.
I look like a boy.

509
00:41:21,629 --> 00:41:23,893
- You'll grow into it.
- What if it falls off?

510
00:41:23,964 --> 00:41:25,932
We'll give refunds.

511
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,834
Now, remember, let's do it
just like we practiced.

512
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:33,340
- Keep your eye on the harness.
- Harness.

513
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:35,341
And don't forget to...

514
00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:37,104
- Grip!
- ... grip!

515
00:41:37,177 --> 00:41:41,546
And don't forget to put
your head to the side. Right?

516
00:41:41,615 --> 00:41:43,549
All right.
You'll do fine.

517
00:41:43,617 --> 00:41:46,051
- There is one thing.
- Yeah?

518
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:48,247
Do I have to bow?

519
00:41:48,322 --> 00:41:50,586
I've never bowed before.
I'll feel stupid.

520
00:41:50,658 --> 00:41:52,489
I don't care if you
fall on your head.

521
00:41:52,559 --> 00:41:55,426
You will smile in front of
those people, and you will bow.

522
00:41:55,496 --> 00:41:57,487
- But I just don't...
- Bow.

523
00:41:58,999 --> 00:42:01,661
What if I can't do it?

524
00:42:01,735 --> 00:42:04,499
What if I lose my nerve,
and I can't go through with it?

525
00:42:04,571 --> 00:42:08,530
- You'll do it.
- But what if I can't?

526
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:11,942
- Will you hate me?
- Mm-hmm.

527
00:42:12,012 --> 00:42:13,604
Oh.

528
00:42:13,681 --> 00:42:15,740
If you feel nervous, look for me.

529
00:42:15,816 --> 00:42:18,649
I'll be in front of the crowd. Okay?

530
00:42:20,087 --> 00:42:22,555
Still don't want to bow.

531
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:25,217
Sonora...

532
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:28,193
...and her brave horse,
Lightning!

533
00:44:13,066 --> 00:44:15,365
Sonora, ladies and gentlemen,

534
00:44:15,436 --> 00:44:18,337
and her brave horse, Lightning!

535
00:44:21,008 --> 00:44:23,533
Sonora, ladies and gentlemen.

536
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:32,146
Sonora!

537
00:44:44,064 --> 00:44:46,430
We got a new diving girl.

538
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:49,401
And a new diving horse.

539
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:52,405
- Do we get to be on a poster?
- We'll get some new posters.

540
00:44:52,473 --> 00:44:55,408
It'll be Marie and Sonora,
the diving girls.

541
00:44:55,476 --> 00:44:58,775
I refuse to share billing
with a stable hand.

542
00:44:58,846 --> 00:45:01,474
Marie, she made the dive.

543
00:45:01,548 --> 00:45:04,517
She is not the star of the show. I am.

544
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:09,346
All right, you're the star.
But we got two diving girls.

545
00:45:09,423 --> 00:45:12,688
Since I'm the star,
I would like more money

546
00:45:12,759 --> 00:45:14,750
and a bigger dressing room.

547
00:45:15,996 --> 00:45:17,896
There's a depression going on...

548
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:21,264
More money, my own dressing room,
and a better poster.

549
00:45:21,335 --> 00:45:24,930
- Or I quit.
- I can't do that, Marie.

550
00:45:28,275 --> 00:45:30,209
Well, then, I quit.

551
00:45:30,277 --> 00:45:33,212
Marie, don't be stubborn.
You can't quit.

552
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:36,511
I am an actress,
not a circus performer!

553
00:45:36,583 --> 00:45:38,346
I am going to New York City.

554
00:45:38,418 --> 00:45:41,216
The next time you see me,
I'm gonna be a big star.

555
00:45:41,288 --> 00:45:44,121
And you will still be
shoveling manure.

556
00:45:47,327 --> 00:45:49,557
# <i>I used to dream</i>

557
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:51,962
# <i>Of highways that seemed</i>

00:45:52,032 --> 00:45:57,265

560
00:46:00,274 --> 00:46:03,437

561
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:05,774

562
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:08,280

563
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:11,442

564
00:46:11,518 --> 00:46:13,918

565
00:46:13,987 --> 00:46:16,148

566
00:46:18,091 --> 00:46:23,154
# <i>Now and then it seems to me</i>

567

00:46:36,176 --> 00:46:38,167

574
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:54,255

00:46:56,563 --> 00:47:00,090

00:47:00,167 --> 00:47:03,295
# <i>Why, Lord, is life so unfair?</i>

578
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:09,540
# <i>Now and then</i>

579
00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:12,306
# <i>It seems to me</i>

580
00:47:12,379 --> 00:47:14,677
# <i>It weren't so bad</i>

581
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:17,410

00:47:17,484 --> 00:47:19,850

00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,411

00:47:22,489 --> 00:47:24,787

00:47:24,858 --> 00:47:27,019
# <i>This feeling blue</i>

586
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:29,961

587
00:47:30,030 --> 00:47:35,400
# <i>Wishing it just weren't true</i> #

588
00:47:50,851 --> 00:47:53,046
What ya doing now?

589
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,418
Finishing that letter
to Franklin County.

590
00:48:04,431 --> 00:48:06,899
He promised he'd write me.
Why doesn't he?

591
00:48:32,626 --> 00:48:35,857
- Thanks for your time.
- It's nothing.

592
00:48:35,929 --> 00:48:38,454
We'll see what we can do.

593
00:48:44,471 --> 00:48:47,531
What if we can't book another show?
What are we gonna do?

594
00:48:47,607 --> 00:48:49,802
That's why I'm driving
to Franklin County,

595
00:48:49,876 --> 00:48:51,901
see if I can find work over there.

596
00:48:51,978 --> 00:48:54,879
- What if there isn't?
- Well, I'm keeping the show open.

597
00:48:54,948 --> 00:48:57,940
- I promise you that.
- And if he doesn't, I will.

598
00:49:01,288 --> 00:49:03,222
All right, now, listen.

599
00:49:03,290 --> 00:49:06,987
You keep them horses fed
and watered, ya hear? Very important.

600
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:09,995
Looks like we won't be back
before tomorrow morning.

601
00:49:10,063 --> 00:49:13,294
- You don't have to worry.
- I know that.

602
00:49:28,982 --> 00:49:31,075
Hey, Red Lips.

603
00:49:36,356 --> 00:49:38,153
Lightning!

604
00:49:41,928 --> 00:49:43,896
Oh, Lightning.
What's the matter?

605
00:49:43,964 --> 00:49:46,057
Come on. Get up.

606
00:49:49,536 --> 00:49:51,663
What's wrong?

607
00:50:40,687 --> 00:50:42,678
Al.

608
00:51:10,417 --> 00:51:11,941
What happened?

609
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:16,118
I don't know. He's awful sick.

610
00:51:17,190 --> 00:51:19,158
Easy, boy. Easy.

611
00:51:21,795 --> 00:51:23,786
What is it, Al?
What's wrong with him?

612
00:51:27,033 --> 00:51:30,594
- Did Red Lips eat any of this?
- No, I don't think so.

613
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:33,605
- It's moldy. It's given him colic.
- What should we do?

614
00:51:33,673 --> 00:51:36,403
Gotta get water and oil into him
and get him to his feet.

615
00:51:36,476 --> 00:51:38,671
- Where's the tack trunk?
- In the barn.

616
00:51:42,716 --> 00:51:45,048
It's gonna be okay, boy.

617
00:51:53,927 --> 00:51:56,327
All right, now hold
this here while I pump.

618
00:51:56,396 --> 00:51:59,160
That's it. Hold it there. Good.

619
00:51:59,232 --> 00:52:02,099
All right. Come here.

620
00:52:04,938 --> 00:52:07,702
Take this.
When I tell you to, pull.

621
00:52:11,244 --> 00:52:13,371
All right, pull. Come on.

622
00:52:14,881 --> 00:52:18,339
Pull! Come on, Lightning.

623
00:52:18,418 --> 00:52:20,511
- Come on, boy.
- Come on!

624
00:52:20,587 --> 00:52:23,317
- Whoa!
- That's it. That's it, boy.

625
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:26,655
Good boy, Lightning. Good boy.

626
00:52:31,031 --> 00:52:33,465
Come on.
We gotta get him moving.

627
00:52:33,533 --> 00:52:35,524
Come on, Lightning.

628
00:52:38,939 --> 00:52:40,907
He's gonna be okay, isn't he?

629
00:52:40,974 --> 00:52:43,704
Yeah, he's gonna be just fine.

630
00:53:21,414 --> 00:53:24,076
Would somebody
please say something?

631
00:53:27,487 --> 00:53:30,115
I thought you could use
a hand with the show.

632
00:53:32,258 --> 00:53:34,283
Ain't no show.

633
00:53:52,746 --> 00:53:55,442
So, why didn't you answer my letters?

634
00:53:56,750 --> 00:53:59,048
I didn't get any letters.

635
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,618
I wrote you just about every day.

636
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:06,516
What did you say?

637
00:54:08,161 --> 00:54:10,095
Stuff.

638
00:54:10,163 --> 00:54:12,427
What kind of stuff?

639
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:14,797
You know, stuff.

640
00:54:17,604 --> 00:54:18,935
Uh-oh.

641
00:54:19,973 --> 00:54:21,907
I got here a telegram

642
00:54:21,975 --> 00:54:24,466
from a John Slater from Atlantic City.

643
00:54:24,544 --> 00:54:26,239
- Atlantic City?
- The Steel Pier.

644
00:54:26,313 --> 00:54:30,374
He wants to negotiate a contract
with us for six months.

645
00:54:31,985 --> 00:54:34,476
You did this, didn't you?

646
00:54:34,554 --> 00:54:38,251
Someone once told me it's where
all your dreams come true.

647
00:54:38,325 --> 00:54:40,657
You got us a contract
and didn't say anything?

648
00:54:40,727 --> 00:54:43,821
Slater didn't promise anything.
He said he'd think about it.

649
00:54:43,897 --> 00:54:45,057
What'd you tell him?

650
00:54:45,131 --> 00:54:48,396
Told him the diving horse
show was an exciting act,

651
00:54:48,468 --> 00:54:51,528
one of a kind, and that my
father was mean and stubborn.

652
00:54:54,908 --> 00:54:57,536
That he was the greatest showman
on Earth.

653
00:55:17,397 --> 00:55:20,264
# <i>On the boardwalk in Atlantic City</i>

654
00:55:20,333 --> 00:55:22,392
# <i>Life can be</i>
<i>peaches and cream</i>

655
00:55:22,469 --> 00:55:25,199
# <i>Cinderella, you will find your fella</i>

656

00:55:27,774 --> 00:55:32,268
# <i>In romantic, enchantic</i>

658
00:55:32,345 --> 00:55:38,079
# <i>Down by the old</i>
<i>New Jersey shore</i> #

659
00:55:40,086 --> 00:55:42,020
Yep.

660
00:55:42,088 --> 00:55:44,022
You know, Sonora,

661
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:46,456
sometimes people make mistakes.

662
00:55:48,328 --> 00:55:51,320
And it's hard to admit
when you have.

663
00:55:51,398 --> 00:55:53,593
Dr. Carver, are you okay?
You look pale.

664
00:55:53,667 --> 00:55:54,998
I'm fine.

665
00:55:55,068 --> 00:55:59,903
You know, when Al left
and was gone all those months

666
00:55:59,973 --> 00:56:02,965
and you didn't hear from him,

667
00:56:03,043 --> 00:56:06,240
I did something that...

668
00:56:12,352 --> 00:56:14,820
- Are you sure you're okay?
- I'm fine.

669
00:56:14,888 --> 00:56:18,688
I think I'll pull over here
just to take a breather.

670
00:56:44,684 --> 00:56:46,618
Why did we stop?

671
00:56:46,686 --> 00:56:48,620
I thought I'd take a little breather.

672
00:56:48,688 --> 00:56:50,679
Good, I'm hungry.

673
00:56:50,757 --> 00:56:53,487
Why don't you rest,
and we'll set up a picnic.

674
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:57,018
Hey, Dad, when we
get to Atlantic City,

675
00:56:57,097 --> 00:56:59,895
the first thing we gotta do
is buy you a new suit.

676
00:57:02,369 --> 00:57:04,963
- Double-breasted?
- Yep.

677
00:57:05,038 --> 00:57:08,235
With pinstripes.

678
00:57:10,944 --> 00:57:13,003
Yeah.

679
00:57:14,447 --> 00:57:16,438
Yeah.

680
00:58:52,312 --> 00:58:55,372
And now, as we've all read,

681
00:58:56,983 --> 00:58:59,645
the book of God's word:

682
00:58:59,719 --> 00:59:03,348
"Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

683
00:59:03,423 --> 00:59:06,790
We now return the spirit
of our departed brother... "

684
01:00:18,131 --> 01:00:20,122
I wasn't gonna give you top billing,

685
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:22,532
but your dad wouldn't have it
any other way.

686
01:00:22,602 --> 01:00:25,230
- We get top billing?
- See for yourself.

687
01:00:25,305 --> 01:00:28,331
- Al, that's me.
- It sure is.

688
01:00:28,408 --> 01:00:30,433
That's me, and that's Lightning.

689
01:00:43,423 --> 01:00:45,687
That guy that runs
the speedboats? Frenchy?

690
01:00:45,758 --> 01:00:48,852
He was gonna throw this away.
Can you believe it?

691
01:00:48,928 --> 01:00:51,419
Yeah, it's a piece of junk.

692
01:00:51,497 --> 01:00:54,057
No, I'm gonna fix it up.

693
01:00:54,133 --> 01:00:56,226
What are you gonna do with it?

694
01:00:56,302 --> 01:00:58,361
I don't know.
I'll think of something.

695
01:00:58,438 --> 01:01:00,872
Ladies and gentlemen,
presenting...

696
01:01:03,543 --> 01:01:06,239
Ladies and gentlemen,
we now present

697
01:01:06,312 --> 01:01:10,112
Carver's high-diving horse
and girl rider.

698
01:01:14,888 --> 01:01:16,822
I was rehearsing.

699
01:01:16,890 --> 01:01:18,949
- Ladies and gentlemen...
- Clifford...

700
01:01:19,025 --> 01:01:20,822
I'm gonna bust your head.

701
01:01:22,795 --> 01:01:25,229
I never introduced a show before.

702
01:01:25,298 --> 01:01:28,062
Do you think I should
wear this suit tomorrow?

703
01:01:28,134 --> 01:01:32,195
- I don't think it'll help.
- Come here, Clifford.

704
01:01:32,272 --> 01:01:35,969
Ow! Ladies and gentlemen...

705
01:01:38,211 --> 01:01:39,678
Stay here.

706
01:01:42,782 --> 01:01:45,182
Ladies and gentlemen, introducing...

707
01:02:16,582 --> 01:02:19,676
<i>Sonora, there was a time</i>
<i>when I couldn't imagine</i>

708
01:02:19,752 --> 01:02:22,346
<i>spending my life</i>
<i>with just one person. </i>

709
01:02:22,422 --> 01:02:25,414
<i>And now I can't imagine</i>
<i>spending it without you. </i>

710
01:02:26,626 --> 01:02:28,651
<i>I love you, Sonora. "

711
01:02:34,334 --> 01:02:36,461
I thought I lost you.

712
01:02:37,904 --> 01:02:40,998
What? What is it?

713
01:02:42,608 --> 01:02:44,769
This is what you should wear.

714
01:02:57,490 --> 01:03:00,152
Turn around.
Let's see how it looks.

715
01:03:01,561 --> 01:03:03,552
Shoulders back.

716
01:03:04,630 --> 01:03:06,723
Raise your arms a bit.

717
01:03:07,967 --> 01:03:10,902
Higher. Higher!

718
01:03:46,939 --> 01:03:49,737
- Whoa.
- Easy.

719
01:03:50,576 --> 01:03:52,544
- Whoa.
- He's awful jittery.

720
01:03:52,612 --> 01:03:54,546
He's not used to all the noise.

721
01:03:54,614 --> 01:03:56,548
Maybe we should jump Lightning.

722
01:03:56,616 --> 01:03:58,675
No, he's not well enough yet.

723
01:03:58,751 --> 01:04:01,185
Whoa! Easy, boy.

724
01:04:17,503 --> 01:04:19,471
<i>Sonora? Sonora Webster?</i>

725
01:04:19,539 --> 01:04:21,700
<i>I want you for my wife. </i>

726
01:04:21,774 --> 01:04:25,073
<i>Will you marry me?</i>

727
01:04:31,250 --> 01:04:34,083
Take my hand in marriage
and make me a happy man.

728
01:04:41,594 --> 01:04:44,654
What do you think
you're doing? You crazy?

729
01:04:44,730 --> 01:04:47,096
Mm-hmm. About you.

730
01:04:47,166 --> 01:04:49,760
I've never been so embarrassed
in my whole life.

731
01:04:49,836 --> 01:04:52,498
All you have to do is say yes.

732
01:04:52,572 --> 01:04:56,064
Yes, yes, yes!

733
01:04:58,211 --> 01:05:00,406
It's just tin and glass.

734
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:02,948
When things get better,
I'll get you a real one.

735
01:05:04,984 --> 01:05:07,452
Are you gonna marry me?
Yes or no?

736
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:11,581
Yes, yes, yes.

737
01:05:15,128 --> 01:05:17,892
Yes!

738
01:05:20,133 --> 01:05:23,125
Go on.
We got a show to do. Go on.

739
01:06:09,948 --> 01:06:11,680
Oh, no!

740
01:06:36,108 --> 01:06:38,042
Here, take him.

741
01:06:38,110 --> 01:06:40,670
- Are you all right?
- Fine. Fine.

742
01:06:41,747 --> 01:06:44,580
- Is Red Lips hurt?
- I don't think so.

743
01:07:02,301 --> 01:07:04,792
Come on.

744
01:07:04,870 --> 01:07:08,306
- Are you sure you're all right?
- It just stung.

745
01:07:08,374 --> 01:07:10,569
When I hit the water,
I had my eyes open.

746
01:07:10,643 --> 01:07:12,406
Clifford, is he okay?

747
01:07:12,478 --> 01:07:15,072
He seems to be all right.
What about you?

748
01:07:15,147 --> 01:07:17,240
Let's get you to the doctor.

749
01:07:17,316 --> 01:07:19,341
I'm not bleeding.

750
01:07:19,418 --> 01:07:21,943
No broken bones.
I'm fine. Don't worry.

751
01:07:22,021 --> 01:07:24,717
Let's get him to the stables
and dry him off.

752
01:08:06,132 --> 01:08:08,692
<i>Excuse me,</i>
<i>but you will have to be still. </i>

753
01:08:08,768 --> 01:08:11,066
Sorry.

754
01:08:11,137 --> 01:08:13,128
Al, what about Slater?

755
01:08:13,205 --> 01:08:14,934
He was pretty concerned.

756
01:08:15,007 --> 01:08:17,805
Tell him not to worry.
I just need a couple of days' rest.

757
01:08:17,877 --> 01:08:20,675
Why didn't you see a doctor
right after your accident?

758
01:08:20,746 --> 01:08:23,715
I got water in them.
They stung a little. That's all.

759
01:08:23,783 --> 01:08:26,013
When you hit the water,
your eyes were open?

760
01:08:26,085 --> 01:08:27,109
Yes.

761
01:08:27,186 --> 01:08:29,120
It caused a slight hemorrhage.

762
01:08:29,188 --> 01:08:32,282
Unattended, this hemorrhage
has continued for days.

763
01:08:32,358 --> 01:08:35,816
The blood clotted
and detached the retina in both eyes.

764
01:08:36,662 --> 01:08:38,527
What does that mean?

765
01:08:39,632 --> 01:08:41,623
Her condition is permanent.

766
01:08:43,703 --> 01:08:45,694
No, it's not.

767
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:49,564
I'm sorry.

768
01:08:49,642 --> 01:08:51,667
Why are you sorry?

769
01:08:53,312 --> 01:08:56,577
I'm gonna rest, and then
I'm gonna get back to work.

770
01:08:56,649 --> 01:08:58,844
It's only temporary.

771
01:08:58,918 --> 01:09:00,943
I'm not blind.

772
01:09:11,764 --> 01:09:14,995
It's a real tough break.
Now, about the show.

773
01:09:15,067 --> 01:09:17,797
This may be not the best time
to talk about this,

774
01:09:17,870 --> 01:09:19,804
but business is business.

775
01:09:19,872 --> 01:09:22,170
I got a lot of money in this show.

776
01:09:22,241 --> 01:09:25,438
That diving tower wasn't cheap.
The publicity, I could...

777
01:09:25,511 --> 01:09:29,709
Publicity! Come here!
I don't care about publicity!

778
01:09:29,782 --> 01:09:31,773
What, are you crazy?

779
01:09:34,620 --> 01:09:36,747
Look, I'm gonna give you a break.

780
01:09:36,822 --> 01:09:40,189
I'm gonna let you close the show
for one week, but that's all.

781
01:09:40,259 --> 01:09:43,695
There's no way I can find
and train a girl in a week.

782
01:09:43,763 --> 01:09:45,788
You better come up with something, kid,

783
01:09:45,865 --> 01:09:49,961
or I'm gonna take you to court
for breach of contract.

784
01:09:57,977 --> 01:10:01,811
One, two, three,

785
01:10:01,881 --> 01:10:05,146
four, five, six...

786
01:10:07,987 --> 01:10:10,012
Ow!

787
01:10:13,926 --> 01:10:17,418
One, two, three...

788
01:10:28,474 --> 01:10:31,136
The blues are here,
right next to the greens.

789
01:10:31,210 --> 01:10:33,007
All right?

790
01:10:33,078 --> 01:10:35,740
- Blues, greens.
- Right.

791
01:10:37,082 --> 01:10:39,107
I've been looking for you.

792
01:10:39,185 --> 01:10:41,745
- I wanna show you something.
- What?

793
01:11:09,882 --> 01:11:12,442
You know what that is? Death.

794
01:11:12,518 --> 01:11:15,783
And do you know what I just did?
I defied it.

795
01:11:15,855 --> 01:11:17,880
It's amazing, Clifford.

796
01:11:19,925 --> 01:11:23,725
Swell, isn't it?
My very own death-defying act.

797
01:11:23,796 --> 01:11:26,629
I'm very proud of you, Clifford.

798
01:11:35,207 --> 01:11:39,769
I guess if you want something
bad enough, anything's possible.

799
01:11:45,484 --> 01:11:46,974
Seen my shoes?

800
01:11:47,052 --> 01:11:49,350
Yeah, you kicked them off
over by the sofa.

801
01:11:49,421 --> 01:11:51,651
- I'll get 'em.
- I'll do it.

802
01:11:51,724 --> 01:11:53,851
- They're right here.
- I'll do it.

803
01:11:57,363 --> 01:11:59,422
Your lipstick's a little smeared.

804
01:11:59,498 --> 01:12:01,989
Thank you.

805
01:12:05,271 --> 01:12:07,034
What?

806
01:12:07,106 --> 01:12:09,700
You got a little problem
with your socks.

807
01:12:09,775 --> 01:12:14,337
- What's wrong with them?
- Well, one's red and one's green.

808
01:12:14,413 --> 01:12:17,541
- I like it, though.
- It's the latest fashion.

809
01:12:24,023 --> 01:12:27,151
It's all right. It's all right.

810
01:12:27,226 --> 01:12:31,686
It's gonna be rough for a while,
but I'm gonna be here to help.

811
01:12:31,764 --> 01:12:33,698
It's gonna take time to adjust.

812
01:12:33,766 --> 01:12:37,827
If you want, we can move
the wedding back until you're ready.

813
01:12:37,903 --> 01:12:40,428
- There's not gonna be a wedding.
- What?

814
01:12:41,907 --> 01:12:45,138
I don't want you marrying me
'cause you feel sorry for me.

815
01:12:45,210 --> 01:12:47,838
I'm marrying you because I love you.

816
01:12:49,114 --> 01:12:52,311
I don't want that kind of love.

817
01:12:52,384 --> 01:12:54,909
I don't want you cutting my food,

818
01:12:54,987 --> 01:12:58,047
getting my socks,
cleaning up my messes.

819
01:12:59,291 --> 01:13:01,316
As soon as my eyes clear up...

820
01:13:01,393 --> 01:13:03,327
Your eyes are not gonna clear up.

821
01:13:03,395 --> 01:13:05,454
Yes, they will.
It's only temporary.

822
01:13:05,531 --> 01:13:08,762
- It's not temporary.
- It is. It is!

823
01:13:08,834 --> 01:13:11,029
- Sonora...
- Let me go!

824
01:13:12,171 --> 01:13:13,934
You've gotta accept this.

825
01:13:14,006 --> 01:13:16,531
You're a human being,
and there are limitations.

826
01:13:16,609 --> 01:13:18,873
You can't run away from it.

827
01:13:18,944 --> 01:13:23,074
You can't hide from it,
and you can't change it. It simply is.

828
01:13:23,148 --> 01:13:25,139
It's permanent.

829
01:13:32,925 --> 01:13:34,950
I know.

830
01:14:20,205 --> 01:14:23,174
Sonora, I'm real sorry
about what happened.

831
01:14:23,242 --> 01:14:26,211
And when Al called
and told me you were hurt,

832
01:14:26,278 --> 01:14:28,906
- I figured the movies had to wait.
- Marie!

833
01:14:28,981 --> 01:14:31,381
- We're ready for you.
- Excuse me, honey.

834
01:14:39,258 --> 01:14:41,658
- Here I am.
- How 'bout puttin' her on the horse?

835
01:14:41,727 --> 01:14:43,786
No, just have me stand next to it.

836
01:14:48,233 --> 01:14:51,134
- That's great.
- You used to be a diving girl.

837
01:14:51,203 --> 01:14:54,366
- Why did you decide to come back?
- I love the audiences.

838
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:57,273
When Al called my mother,
she called the Astoria Studios,

839
01:14:57,342 --> 01:14:59,367
where I was auditioning
for a movie.

840
01:14:59,445 --> 01:15:01,436
How long you gonna be
in Atlantic City?

841
01:15:01,513 --> 01:15:02,844
That's M-A-R-I-E.

842
01:15:02,915 --> 01:15:06,180
Excuse me, sis. You're in the shot.
Could you move?

843
01:15:18,897 --> 01:15:21,832
Sonora, what are you doin'?

844
01:15:30,109 --> 01:15:32,907
- Al, I've been thinking.
- About what?

845
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:36,675
I'm going to dive again.

846
01:15:38,250 --> 01:15:40,616
Honey, you can't.
It's impossible.

847
01:15:40,686 --> 01:15:42,677
I can do it. I know I can.

848
01:15:42,755 --> 01:15:44,916
Sonora, you've gotta be realistic.

849
01:15:46,925 --> 01:15:48,984
With Lightning...

850
01:15:49,061 --> 01:15:51,291
Al, he knows what I'm thinking.

851
01:15:52,464 --> 01:15:54,591
And I know what he's thinking.

852
01:15:56,869 --> 01:15:58,894
Absolutely not. It's too dangerous.

853
01:16:00,973 --> 01:16:02,964
I have to do this.

854
01:16:04,443 --> 01:16:06,570
Please, I need your help.

855
01:16:18,323 --> 01:16:20,314
Here he comes.

856
01:16:26,865 --> 01:16:29,060
Here he comes.

857
01:16:40,045 --> 01:16:42,809
Here he comes again.

858
01:16:49,721 --> 01:16:51,416
You okay?

859
01:16:53,325 --> 01:16:55,793
Again.

860
01:16:58,897 --> 01:17:01,422
Watch your step.

861
01:17:09,675 --> 01:17:11,700
Again.

862
01:17:18,083 --> 01:17:21,849
You can't let her do this.
Besides, you have Marie to do the show.

863
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:24,354
This has nothing to do
with your show.

864
01:17:26,491 --> 01:17:28,425
Do you think she can do this?

865
01:17:28,493 --> 01:17:32,987
Huh? Look me in the eye
and tell me she can do this.

866
01:17:35,634 --> 01:17:38,432
- It's just what I thought.
- Come on.

867
01:17:42,608 --> 01:17:46,942
Close out all other sounds
and listen to his hooves.

868
01:17:47,012 --> 01:17:50,778
Don't go to the horse.
Let the horse come to you.

869
01:17:52,985 --> 01:17:55,283
Let your hands
slide along his chest

870
01:17:55,354 --> 01:17:57,447
and up his shoulder
to the harness.

871
01:17:57,522 --> 01:18:00,491
When you feel the harness, grip.

872
01:18:03,929 --> 01:18:06,727
Let the horse's momentum
pull you up.

873
01:18:07,566 --> 01:18:09,557
- That's it!
- Ah!

874
01:18:11,270 --> 01:18:13,363
You all right?

875
01:18:26,585 --> 01:18:28,576
This isn't working.

876
01:18:29,655 --> 01:18:31,589
I just need a little more time.

877
01:18:31,657 --> 01:18:34,125
No, it's gotta stop.
I don't want you hurt.

878
01:18:34,192 --> 01:18:36,786
- But, Al!
- Look, we tried. It didn't work.

879
01:18:36,862 --> 01:18:39,854
This can't be done,
and it's gonna end right here.

880
01:18:39,932 --> 01:18:41,923
You understand?

881
01:18:46,438 --> 01:18:48,429
Yes.

882
01:20:32,444 --> 01:20:35,880
Hi. Are you gonna be okay?
I gotta introduce the show.

883
01:20:35,947 --> 01:20:37,175
I'm okay.

884
01:20:43,188 --> 01:20:46,783
Ladies and gentlemen,
we now present

885
01:20:46,858 --> 01:20:49,793
Carver's high-diving horse
and girl rider

886
01:20:49,861 --> 01:20:52,261
in a daring 40-foot plunge
on horseback.

887
01:20:52,998 --> 01:20:54,761
Marie, can I talk to you?

888
01:20:54,833 --> 01:20:56,801
- What's going on?
- Thank you.

889
01:20:56,868 --> 01:20:58,927
- Clifford!
- <i>In a few moments,</i>

890
01:20:59,004 --> 01:21:01,472
<i>you will witness</i>
<i>the courageous Marie</i>

891
01:21:01,540 --> 01:21:05,101
<i>attempting this feat on the</i>
<i>bare back of her trusted steed. </i>

892
01:21:05,177 --> 01:21:06,735
Open this door!

893
01:21:06,812 --> 01:21:10,043
It is the only act of its kind
anywhere in the world today,

894
01:21:10,115 --> 01:21:12,481
<i>an act in which</i>
<i>the safety of the rider</i>

895
01:21:12,551 --> 01:21:16,385
<i>depends entirely on the intelligence</i>
<i>and skill of the horse. </i>

896
01:21:16,455 --> 01:21:19,390
<i>It is an act in which</i>
<i>no electrical devices,</i>

897
01:21:19,458 --> 01:21:23,019
<i>no mechanical apparatus,</i>
<i>no force of any kind,</i>

898
01:21:23,095 --> 01:21:25,723
<i>and no cue of any sort</i>
<i>is used to persuade... </i>

899
01:21:28,100 --> 01:21:30,091
Hyah!

900
01:21:33,805 --> 01:21:37,036
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>for the safety of our performers,</i>

901
01:21:37,109 --> 01:21:38,235
<i>hold your applause... </i>

902
01:21:42,614 --> 01:21:45,082
<i>I am proud to present</i>
<i>the most popular act</i>

903
01:21:45,150 --> 01:21:47,345
<i>in the history of the Steel Pier. </i>

904
01:21:54,693 --> 01:21:56,627
Carver! What is going on here?

905
01:21:56,695 --> 01:21:59,789
I don't know.
I'm gonna find out.

906
01:21:59,865 --> 01:22:01,958
Mommy, there's a girl
climbing the tower!

907
01:22:02,033 --> 01:22:04,331
Oh, no. Sonora!

908
01:22:07,439 --> 01:22:10,966
These people didn't pay to see
a blind girl kill herself.

909
01:22:11,042 --> 01:22:13,408
Sonora, don't!

910
01:22:13,478 --> 01:22:15,605
Sonora, no!

911
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:19,946
- Carver!
- No, Sonora! No!

912
01:23:31,690 --> 01:23:33,453
Did you see that?

913
01:23:33,525 --> 01:23:35,755
She was wonderful!
Did you see that?

914
01:24:41,826 --> 01:24:45,023
<i>That last dive</i>
<i>began 11 years of diving blind,</i>

915
01:24:45,096 --> 01:24:47,496
<i>and the audience never knew. </i>

916
01:24:47,565 --> 01:24:49,590
<i>I had found my destiny,</i>

917
01:24:49,668 --> 01:24:52,967
<i>not in faraway places,</i>
<i>but within myself. </i>

918
01:24:53,038 --> 01:24:55,370
<i>I also found happiness with Al. </i>

919
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:58,967
<i>We were married that fall</i>
<i>and had a wonderful life together. </i>
