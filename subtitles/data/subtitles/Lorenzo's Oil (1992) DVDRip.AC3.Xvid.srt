00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:59,333
COMOROS ISLANDS
East Africa, July 1983

2
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:35,772
Omouri, what's happening?

3
00:01:43,262 --> 00:01:45,856
Which hand, Lorenzo?

4
00:01:53,702 --> 00:01:55,658
It's superb.

5
00:01:58,462 --> 00:02:01,694
It's yours.
-Then it's even better.

6
00:02:14,903 --> 00:02:18,100
One orange.
-One orange.

7
00:02:18,223 --> 00:02:21,340
Chungwa moja.
-Chungwa moja.

8
00:02:21,463 --> 00:02:24,500
Two oranges.
-Two oranges.

9
00:02:24,623 --> 00:02:28,219
Machungwa mawili.
-Machungwa mawili.

10
00:02:28,344 --> 00:02:31,893
One pineapple.
-One pineapple.

11
00:02:33,384 --> 00:02:37,536
This is my mother.
All her sisters have red hair.

12
00:02:38,584 --> 00:02:40,734
They call it "Murphy" hair.

13
00:02:42,664 --> 00:02:45,576
This is Papa. He's Italian.
He wants to go home to Italy...

14
00:02:45,704 --> 00:02:49,743
because the tomatoes in America
taste like cardboard.

15
00:02:51,585 --> 00:02:54,861
But the World Bank wants him
back in Washington.

16
00:02:54,985 --> 00:02:56,976
And what's this?

17
00:02:58,385 --> 00:03:01,616
This one is me -
Lorenzo Michael Murphy Odone.

18
00:03:01,745 --> 00:03:03,940
But why paint all this on a kite?

19
00:03:04,065 --> 00:03:07,501
So Omouri won't forget
what we were like.

20
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:09,775
What a lovely "goodbye" gift.

21
00:04:02,027 --> 00:04:03,983
Omouri! Omouri!

22
00:04:06,508 --> 00:04:08,464
Guess which hand.

23
00:04:17,148 --> 00:04:19,298
Omouri, get ready.

24
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:09,146
WASHINGTON DC

25
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:12,023
Here he is,
the cleverest boy in the world.

26
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,306
Three Months Later

27
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:16,547
Hi, Mom.
-What's this?

28
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:19,025
It's a picture.
-Oh, my goodness.

29
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:21,870
And there's the Comoros.
-Of course it is.

30
00:05:21,991 --> 00:05:25,063
Mrs Odone, may I have a word?
-Very skilful, sweetheart.

31
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:27,910
And Jupiter.
-Jupiter next to the Comoros?

32
00:05:28,031 --> 00:05:31,103
I'll be right there, Lorenzo.
-OK, Mommy.

33
00:05:31,231 --> 00:05:34,985
Is Lorenzo having problems at home?
-Not that I know of. Why?

34
00:05:35,111 --> 00:05:39,821
Today he started throwing paints around.
He went wild, destroying other paintings.

35
00:05:39,951 --> 00:05:43,068
He must have been provoked.
-No, it came out of the blue.

36
00:05:43,191 --> 00:05:45,546
He's normally such a terrific kid.

37
00:05:49,912 --> 00:05:52,551
Darling, were they teasing you?
-No.

38
00:05:52,672 --> 00:05:55,140
Were they touching your paints?
-No.

39
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:57,627
How were they annoying you?
-They just were.

40
00:05:57,752 --> 00:05:59,424
Doing what?
-Things.

41
00:05:59,552 --> 00:06:03,591
What kind of things?
-Things that make me feel annoyed.

42
00:06:10,152 --> 00:06:11,505
Mrs Odone...
-Another incident?

43
00:06:11,632 --> 00:06:14,466
Yes, and today it was much worse.

44
00:06:14,593 --> 00:06:17,903
Mrs Odone, is there
some trouble at home?

45
00:06:18,033 --> 00:06:19,989
Why do you assume
the trouble's at home?

46
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:22,609
Because there's nothing here
that explains his behaviour.

47
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:25,551
It's... disturbed.

48
00:06:51,154 --> 00:06:53,384
He does present as a hyperactive.

49
00:06:53,514 --> 00:06:57,666
But don't they repeat tasks endlessly?
-They perseverate, yes.

50
00:06:57,794 --> 00:07:01,503
Lorenzo's activities all have a
structure: beginning, middle and end.

51
00:07:01,634 --> 00:07:05,548
My gosh, he's learned three languages.
How could he be hyperactive?

52
00:07:06,595 --> 00:07:10,144
I know it's hard to accept that
a gifted child may also be disturbed.

53
00:07:10,275 --> 00:07:13,233
Lorenzo needs to be
referred to an IDP committee.

54
00:07:13,355 --> 00:07:15,152
What's that?
-For what?

55
00:07:15,275 --> 00:07:17,914
Individual Disability Placement.

56
00:07:18,035 --> 00:07:21,345
Lorenzo needs to be
in a special ed class.

57
00:07:21,475 --> 00:07:25,263
Any special ed our son needs
will be provided at home.

58
00:07:25,395 --> 00:07:29,105
Anyhow, it was snowing and he began
to rub my hands to warm them.

59
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:32,714
No, he then produced photos
of his wife and children.

60
00:07:32,836 --> 00:07:35,589
That old routine!
-Oh, Deirdre!

61
00:07:35,716 --> 00:07:38,435
Had I known this was the man
I would wait ten years for,...

62
00:07:38,556 --> 00:07:41,070
I'd have let you pick up the cheque.
-I did.

63
00:07:41,196 --> 00:07:43,152
Excuse me! You did not!

64
00:08:00,517 --> 00:08:04,396
Lorenzo's fallen off his bike
and he is really bleeding.

65
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:07,236
Sh. That's a boy.

66
00:08:07,357 --> 00:08:09,791
Oh, such a brave boy.

67
00:08:09,917 --> 00:08:11,873
Doing just fine, here.

68
00:08:11,997 --> 00:08:14,557
You're going to be OK.

69
00:08:14,677 --> 00:08:16,554
It's Christmas Day, you know.

70
00:08:16,677 --> 00:08:20,830
All across the country little boys
are trying out their new bikes.

71
00:08:22,438 --> 00:08:26,192
Hey, champ. I think you'd better
tell your folks to lighten up.

72
00:08:26,318 --> 00:08:29,355
What are they gonna do when
you're playing for the Redskins?

73
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:15,398
The EEG is normal, the skull x-ray
is normal and the CT scan is normal.

74
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,910
I don't know what to tell you.
This boy is neurologically intact.

75
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,918
Doctor, we spent
three years in East Africa.

76
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,508
In the Comoros.
-We were wondering...

77
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,916
Well, if he might have
picked up some rare parasite.

78
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,631
It's possible.

79
00:09:39,441 --> 00:09:41,397
Lorenzo, what are you doing?

80
00:09:43,001 --> 00:09:44,957
Lorenzo!

81
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:55,629
Sweetie? Can you hear Mommy?

82
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:59,198
This may be an auditory
processing difficulty.

83
00:09:59,322 --> 00:10:04,237
The ears hear all right,
but the brain has trouble listening.

84
00:10:04,362 --> 00:10:08,275
So, this means something
is affecting his brain.

85
00:10:08,402 --> 00:10:11,838
But what? A tumour? Multiple sclerosis?

86
00:10:11,962 --> 00:10:13,998
It could be any one of a dozen things.

87
00:10:20,322 --> 00:10:21,835
WASHINGTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL

88
00:10:21,962 --> 00:10:23,919
Easter Weekend 1984

89
00:10:24,243 --> 00:10:28,759
Listen, my friend. I'd like you to come
and stay in the hospital for three days.

90
00:10:28,883 --> 00:10:30,714
Your mom and dad can come too.

91
00:10:30,843 --> 00:10:33,755
We're gonna run some tests
and get to the bottom of this.

92
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:42,074
Can you hear the sound?

93
00:10:42,523 --> 00:10:46,277
Keep your eyes right on that spot
for me. That helps me out.

94
00:10:47,603 --> 00:10:49,435
All right. Now close your eyes.

95
00:11:02,564 --> 00:11:05,920
Keep your eyes closed, buddy.
Stay nice and still.

96
00:12:48,408 --> 00:12:52,765
Of course, Easter festivals
existed long before baby Jesus.

97
00:12:52,888 --> 00:12:55,881
In pagan times, they marked
the beginning of Spring.

98
00:12:56,009 --> 00:12:59,774
The egg tells us that the
earth is going to be reborn,

99
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,958
just like a little baby chick.

100
00:13:01,089 --> 00:13:03,728
I get it.
-Mrs Odone. Mr Odone.

101
00:13:04,129 --> 00:13:06,199
Dr Judalon is ready now.

102
00:13:06,329 --> 00:13:09,878
Hey, Lorenzo, would you like
to go feed the goldfish?

103
00:13:10,529 --> 00:13:12,565
It's all right, sweetheart. Go ahead.

104
00:13:12,689 --> 00:13:16,523
We'll be right back
in just a few minutes. Go ahead.

105
00:13:16,649 --> 00:13:18,605
This way, please.

106
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,526
Please, have a seat.

107
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:42,521
Well, we certainly don't need
that noise, do we?

108
00:13:50,571 --> 00:13:51,481
So...

109
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:55,287
Please, Doctor, without equivocation.

110
00:13:58,411 --> 00:14:01,767
There is a family of diseases.
It's quite rare.

111
00:14:01,891 --> 00:14:04,166
The leukodystrophies.

112
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:07,442
Lorenzo has one of them.
It's called ALD.

113
00:14:09,171 --> 00:14:14,087
ALD is an inborn error of metabolism
that causes a degeneration of the brain.

114
00:14:15,332 --> 00:14:19,769
It only affects males, usually
between the ages of five and ten.

115
00:14:20,612 --> 00:14:24,571
Its progress is relentless.
The end is inevitable.

116
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:30,089
All boys with ALD die, usually
within two years of diagnosis.

117
00:14:39,493 --> 00:14:41,643
And there are no exceptions?

118
00:14:42,773 --> 00:14:44,729
I am so sorry.

119
00:14:46,813 --> 00:14:49,168
Are you absolutely sure?
-Yes.

120
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:53,528
Lorenzo shows the definitive sign:

121
00:14:53,653 --> 00:14:59,603
an abnormally high level of fat in his
blood, certain long-chain saturated fats.

122
00:15:02,374 --> 00:15:04,126
Oh.

123
00:15:05,494 --> 00:15:07,246
Uh...

124
00:15:07,894 --> 00:15:11,250
These fats... destroy his brain?

125
00:15:13,494 --> 00:15:15,450
But how?

126
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:19,252
There is an enzyme
that should metabolise these fats,...

127
00:15:19,374 --> 00:15:21,524
but in ALD boys it's defective.

128
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:23,707
So they collect in the nerve cells,

129
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:27,332
a little bit like a
cluster on the arteries.

130
00:15:27,455 --> 00:15:31,243
And... in some way...

131
00:15:32,255 --> 00:15:35,167
this liquefies
the white matter of the brain.

132
00:15:35,295 --> 00:15:38,810
"Some way liquefies"?
Could you be more specific?

133
00:15:38,935 --> 00:15:43,087
Well, to be honest, we're not
quite certain just how it works.

134
00:15:44,255 --> 00:15:46,610
You know what myelin is?
-No.

135
00:15:47,535 --> 00:15:51,369
Myelin is the fatty... sheath
that insulates the nerves.

136
00:15:51,495 --> 00:15:54,727
It's a little bit like plastic
around electrical wires.

137
00:15:54,856 --> 00:15:58,246
Without it, the nerves
cannot conduct an impulse.

138
00:15:58,376 --> 00:16:03,325
What ALD does is strip away the myelin.
It corrodes it, if you like.

139
00:16:03,456 --> 00:16:08,007
This causes degeneration of the brain
and the body loses its functions.

140
00:16:13,896 --> 00:16:17,606
But surely someone, somewhere,
must be working on this, no?

141
00:16:17,737 --> 00:16:19,887
We would go anywhere.
-Yes.

142
00:16:20,617 --> 00:16:23,370
Ten years ago the disease
hadn't even been identified.

143
00:16:23,497 --> 00:16:26,933
We're still trying to
understand just what it is.

144
00:16:32,857 --> 00:16:36,372
I would like to
offer you some hope, but...

145
00:16:38,777 --> 00:16:41,814
Then there's absolutely no treatment?

146
00:16:45,258 --> 00:16:48,056
Normally at this point
we try to be constructive.

147
00:16:48,178 --> 00:16:51,215
We try to focus on what can be done.

148
00:16:51,338 --> 00:16:53,294
But in this case...

149
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:54,618
When we get home, can we read a story?

150
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,696
Of course, my darling.

151
00:18:01,501 --> 00:18:04,061
Lorenzino, let's go home.

152
00:20:31,827 --> 00:20:34,295
Mr Odone? I have
a Dr Judalon on line three.

153
00:20:34,427 --> 00:20:37,703
Good. Put him through.
-They're waiting for you in the meeting.

154
00:20:37,827 --> 00:20:39,579
All right, thank you.

155
00:20:39,707 --> 00:20:40,935
Hello?
-Augusto?

156
00:20:41,067 --> 00:20:43,501
I just got off the
phone to Gus Nikolais,...

157
00:20:43,627 --> 00:20:46,903
a professor of neurology at
the Institute of Childhood Diseases.

158
00:20:47,027 --> 00:20:53,216
If there is a so-called "world expert"
on the leukodystrophies, Nikolais is it.

159
00:20:53,347 --> 00:20:55,623
Ah, good.
-I don't want to raise false hopes,...

160
00:20:55,748 --> 00:21:00,264
but he's working on
an experimental protocol based on a diet.

161
00:21:00,388 --> 00:21:01,821
Wonderful.

162
00:21:14,748 --> 00:21:16,659
Peanut butter, red meat, cheese...

163
00:21:16,788 --> 00:21:20,338
Unpeeled fruit, spinach, olive oil...
But these are healthy foods.

164
00:21:20,469 --> 00:21:24,462
Yes, but they contain
very long-chain saturated fats.

165
00:21:25,229 --> 00:21:26,503
I...

166
00:21:26,629 --> 00:21:31,225
I still do not understand why
they are so harmful to Lorenzo.

167
00:21:31,349 --> 00:21:35,103
Why are they so destructive?
-How can spinach make the difference?

168
00:21:35,229 --> 00:21:39,620
The human body needs these fats
in order to create cells,...

169
00:21:39,749 --> 00:21:43,424
and the excess is burned off.
That's normally, of course.

170
00:21:43,549 --> 00:21:47,509
But in the case of an ALD boy,
these saturates can't be broken down...

171
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:49,586
and they build up in the brain.

172
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:54,943
And somehow this build-up
strips the myelin covering.

173
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:58,062
Yes, exactly. And, for the moment,
we don't know why this is.

174
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:02,149
But we feel that, by withdrawing
the saturated fats from the diet,...

175
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:04,659
we will prevent them
accumulating in the brain.

176
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,223
And if we could?

177
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:09,183
There's no way to reverse
neurological damage.

178
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:13,270
All we can hope for is
to slow the cascade of symptoms.

179
00:22:13,391 --> 00:22:16,542
But if it's any consolation to you,
you'll be helping us...

180
00:22:16,671 --> 00:22:20,823
understand the biochemistry
of this heartless disease.

181
00:22:22,951 --> 00:22:26,387
So, can we enrol Lorenzo in our trial?

182
00:22:29,591 --> 00:22:31,547
I suppose so.

183
00:22:32,631 --> 00:22:37,228
Good. Then I will pass you
over to our dietician...

184
00:22:37,352 --> 00:22:41,948
and meanwhile we should arrange
some genetic counselling.

185
00:22:42,072 --> 00:22:45,667
Oh, Dr Nikolais, it's highly unlikely
that we will have another child.

186
00:22:45,792 --> 00:22:48,989
No, but your sisters and their daughters
may all be carriers.

187
00:22:49,112 --> 00:22:52,422
We need to test them.
-Only my family? What about his?

188
00:22:52,552 --> 00:22:56,864
No, no. ALD is passed
only through the mother.

189
00:22:57,952 --> 00:22:59,908
But I thought you understood all this.

190
00:23:02,353 --> 00:23:05,982
We knew it was inborn, but...

191
00:23:06,673 --> 00:23:09,983
we assumed that meant
a combination of our genes.

192
00:23:10,113 --> 00:23:12,468
That's true in other
inherited diseases,...

193
00:23:12,593 --> 00:23:15,027
but ALD is only carried
on the female chromosome.

194
00:23:15,153 --> 00:23:17,109
Excuse me.

195
00:23:18,353 --> 00:23:21,425
Are you saying that Lorenzo
got this directly from me?

196
00:23:22,553 --> 00:23:26,866
Well, in the sense that
ALD is sex-linked, yes.

197
00:23:28,034 --> 00:23:30,184
It goes from mother to son.

198
00:23:31,714 --> 00:23:36,071
And how did I get it?
-The woman gets it from her mother.

199
00:23:36,194 --> 00:23:39,391
And if I inherited the defect,
why don't I have the disease?

200
00:23:39,514 --> 00:23:42,870
No, the woman is only
the carrier, nothing else.

201
00:23:43,354 --> 00:23:48,508
But with each conception, she has
a 50-50 chance of passing on the defect.

202
00:23:48,634 --> 00:23:51,229
And when that happens...

203
00:23:51,355 --> 00:23:54,506
It's the cruellest
kind of genetic lottery.

204
00:23:55,275 --> 00:23:57,072
Lottery?
-Yes, a clumsy word.

205
00:23:57,195 --> 00:24:01,154
I use it because it's...
so arbitrary, you know.

206
00:24:01,275 --> 00:24:03,425
No one is to blame.
-Um...

207
00:24:04,315 --> 00:24:07,227
If Michaela's mother had this,...

208
00:24:07,355 --> 00:24:09,710
and her mother's mother,...

209
00:24:11,635 --> 00:24:13,626
why was there no warning?

210
00:24:14,155 --> 00:24:17,466
Well, I suppose if you went back
into the family tree, you'd...

211
00:24:17,596 --> 00:24:22,750
But remember, a short time ago
this disease didn't even have a name.

212
00:24:24,076 --> 00:24:28,069
Mrs Odone, you have enough
to put up with without...

213
00:24:28,196 --> 00:24:30,551
You have nothing to blame yourself for.

214
00:24:34,356 --> 00:24:36,312
Thank you.

215
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:45,836
It's not a good idea.

216
00:24:45,957 --> 00:24:50,712
All right, so she doesn't want me. What
about Mother? She's packed and ready.

217
00:24:50,837 --> 00:24:53,909
Kenise, Michaela doesn't
want anybody around.

218
00:24:54,037 --> 00:24:56,267
What about Father Killian? He can come.

219
00:24:56,397 --> 00:24:58,627
Hell, no. She's not even
going to Mass now.

220
00:24:58,757 --> 00:25:01,635
Deirdre, what is happening there?
-Just let it rest, OK?

221
00:25:01,757 --> 00:25:04,032
No. What will they do
for Lorenzo's birthday?

222
00:25:04,157 --> 00:25:06,433
I'll call you. Bye.
-No. Deirdre!

223
00:25:07,438 --> 00:25:11,033
This is wrong. More than ever
she needs her family here.

224
00:25:11,158 --> 00:25:13,718
She doesn't want nobody.
She's too angry.

225
00:25:13,838 --> 00:25:15,874
We cannot afford the time to be angry.

226
00:25:15,998 --> 00:25:18,114
Come on, look what she's dealing with.

227
00:25:18,238 --> 00:25:20,194
She does not have to deal with it alone.

228
00:25:20,318 --> 00:25:25,267
She feels incredibly alone and unlucky,
like she's been singled out by God.

229
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:28,356
Oh, Deirdre!
-Yes! Kenise is a carrier with two girls.

230
00:25:28,478 --> 00:25:32,711
Me, a carrier with no kids at all, and
Mariah has a boy but she's not a carrier.

231
00:25:32,839 --> 00:25:34,875
So only Michaela gets this laid on her.

232
00:25:34,999 --> 00:25:40,073
This did not happen only to Michaela.
-Sure. You got two kids already, Odone.

233
00:25:40,199 --> 00:25:42,315
Mommy will make you something better:

234
00:25:42,439 --> 00:25:45,795
a big-boy fruit treat
with five different colours.

235
00:25:53,799 --> 00:25:58,555
She waited all this time to have one
child. She's not gonna have another.

236
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,516
May 29th 1984

237
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,790
Lorenzo's Sixth Birthday

238
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,759
Francesco! Cristina!

239
00:26:25,481 --> 00:26:27,631
Ah, buongiorno.
-Oh, Francesco!

240
00:26:27,761 --> 00:26:30,070
Mother sends her regards.

241
00:26:31,161 --> 00:26:34,517
This is for Lorenzo.
We missed you so much.

242
00:26:34,641 --> 00:26:37,439
Francesco and I couldn't wait
to see you again.

243
00:26:37,561 --> 00:26:39,836
Papa, how is Lorenzo?

244
00:26:39,961 --> 00:26:42,521
Today he's OK. Thank God.

245
00:26:43,961 --> 00:26:46,395
Now listen...
Michaela is in a lot of pain.

246
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:48,717
She may be cold towards you.

247
00:26:48,842 --> 00:26:52,676
Look at the two of you.
More handsome each time I see you.

248
00:26:52,802 --> 00:26:53,917
Cristina.
-Michaela.

249
00:26:54,042 --> 00:26:55,998
How are you?
-I'm fine.

250
00:26:56,122 --> 00:26:57,157
Ciao.

251
00:26:57,282 --> 00:27:00,194
Fancy coming all this way
for our Lorenzo. Thank you.

252
00:27:00,322 --> 00:27:02,711
It's lovely to be here.
-Come with me.

253
00:27:02,842 --> 00:27:04,355
How is everything?
-Fine.

254
00:27:04,482 --> 00:27:06,438
It's lovely here.

255
00:27:07,122 --> 00:27:12,880
Everyone, this is Lorenzo's sister
and brother, all the way from Rome.

256
00:27:53,244 --> 00:27:55,200
This does not make sense.

257
00:27:56,604 --> 00:27:59,118
Lorenzo's saturated fats have risen.

258
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:04,194
We eliminate them from his diet,
and in his blood they increase.

259
00:28:05,325 --> 00:28:09,477
If these very long-chain saturated fats
are destroying his mind,...

260
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:12,039
then surely we should
take him off the diet.

261
00:28:12,165 --> 00:28:14,395
Mr Odone, please be patient.

262
00:28:14,525 --> 00:28:19,155
Your son has been on the diet only six
weeks. Wait until the end of the trial.

263
00:28:19,285 --> 00:28:23,915
Dr Nikolais, what about the other boys?
What results are you seeing in them?

264
00:28:24,045 --> 00:28:26,798
As with Lorenzo, it's too early to tell.

265
00:28:26,925 --> 00:28:30,396
We need the study to run
for the full six months.

266
00:28:30,526 --> 00:28:32,835
That will tell you what
is obvious right now,...

267
00:28:32,966 --> 00:28:37,437
that avoiding apple skins and pizza
has no effect on this brutal disease.

268
00:28:37,566 --> 00:28:41,010
Now, please, Doctor,
is there anyone out there

269
00:28:41,011 --> 00:28:43,721
who is chasing
a definitive therapy?

270
00:28:44,486 --> 00:28:48,399
You judge us too hastily. The French
have tried bone-marrow transplants,...

271
00:28:48,526 --> 00:28:51,996
and in Boston we're about
to try immunosuppression.

272
00:28:52,126 --> 00:28:55,961
Why haven't we heard of these before?
-The transplants were disastrous...

273
00:28:56,087 --> 00:28:59,045
and the immunosuppression
is highly experimental.

274
00:28:59,167 --> 00:29:01,556
The protocol has been limited
to six boys,...

275
00:29:01,687 --> 00:29:04,963
all more profoundly
afflicted than your son.

276
00:29:05,087 --> 00:29:08,602
For God's sake! How afflicted
does he need to be?

277
00:29:08,727 --> 00:29:11,764
It's a school, Lorenzo,
like any other school.

278
00:29:11,887 --> 00:29:16,836
And it's full of doctors?
-Yes. Some of the cleverest in America.

279
00:29:17,287 --> 00:29:19,518
What colour is that cross?
-Red.

280
00:29:20,568 --> 00:29:22,524
That's right. It's red.

281
00:29:23,808 --> 00:29:28,006
I'll speak to your parents for a second.
Leah's gonna take your blood pressure.

282
00:29:28,128 --> 00:29:30,084
I'll be right back.

283
00:29:30,208 --> 00:29:32,768
I'll just put this around your arm.

284
00:29:33,848 --> 00:29:36,601
You've had this done before, haven't you?

285
00:29:38,208 --> 00:29:42,042
Look, it's important you both
know exactly what's going on.

286
00:29:42,168 --> 00:29:45,127
Cyclophosphides are no picnic.
This is chemotherapy.

287
00:29:45,249 --> 00:29:49,288
We're gonna be suppressing
his immune system. It's very high-risk.

288
00:29:49,409 --> 00:29:52,879
We'll need to keep him here
at least three weeks.

289
00:29:53,009 --> 00:29:56,445
Now, Lorenzo is still walking,
talking and communicating.

290
00:29:56,569 --> 00:29:58,719
But that could all change.

291
00:29:58,849 --> 00:30:02,808
Now, knowing all this, do you
still want us to go ahead with it?

292
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:07,119
Given the alternatives, yes.

293
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:12,806
One Month Later

294
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:22,284
The faculty is very grateful
to Lorenzo for doing this.

295
00:30:34,331 --> 00:30:38,882
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Lorenzo
Odone, whom I've spoken to you about.

296
00:30:39,011 --> 00:30:41,969
Now, young Mr Odone,
you need to come with me.

297
00:30:44,851 --> 00:30:46,807
You are getting so big!

298
00:30:48,771 --> 00:30:52,366
Now, I'm gonna put you up here
so we can all see you, OK?

299
00:30:52,491 --> 00:30:53,924
Attaboy.

300
00:30:55,811 --> 00:30:58,371
Ten weeks after diagnosis
we observe hemianopia...

301
00:30:58,491 --> 00:31:00,687
with transient horizontal nystagmus.

302
00:31:00,812 --> 00:31:03,246
The pupillary light reflexes
are still intact,...

303
00:31:03,372 --> 00:31:05,249
and, as yet, there's no optic atrophy.

304
00:31:05,372 --> 00:31:08,808
However, there is evidence of
early occipital-lobe involvement.

305
00:31:08,932 --> 00:31:13,289
Why are all
these people here?

306
00:31:13,412 --> 00:31:19,044
I beg your pardon, Lorenzo?
-Why are all these people here?

307
00:31:19,172 --> 00:31:21,732
He asks why all these people are here.

308
00:31:22,892 --> 00:31:26,010
Well, they're all doctors...

309
00:31:26,133 --> 00:31:29,091
and they want to learn
how to help other boys in the future.

310
00:31:29,213 --> 00:31:31,602
Other boys with the boo-boo?

311
00:31:32,013 --> 00:31:35,210
Yes, darling.
-Mm-hm.

312
00:31:35,773 --> 00:31:37,729
Thank you, Lorenzo.

313
00:31:39,733 --> 00:31:44,443
Now, in the scanning speech,
we look for both ends of the pathology:

314
00:31:44,573 --> 00:31:48,725
centrally for the dysphasia,
and peripherally for the dysarthria.

315
00:31:49,974 --> 00:31:53,091
Now, Lorenzo, would you
walk for me, please?

316
00:31:54,654 --> 00:31:56,246
Attaboy.

317
00:31:57,454 --> 00:32:00,014
That's right. Hold my hands.

318
00:32:00,134 --> 00:32:02,090
That's right.

319
00:32:03,454 --> 00:32:08,005
Two months ago there was simply motor
lag. Now note the characteristic gait.

320
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:13,686
It's due mostly to hyperreflexia, but
exacerbated by the encroaching paresis.

321
00:32:14,494 --> 00:32:16,486
You're doing very well. Keep coming.

322
00:32:16,615 --> 00:32:21,166
Only if you stop talking like that.

323
00:32:55,136 --> 00:32:57,934
Hello, Mr Odone. Have I got that right?

324
00:32:58,056 --> 00:33:00,695
Odo-ne.
-Odo-ne? I'm sorry.

325
00:33:00,816 --> 00:33:03,535
Ellard Muscatine.
I'm with the ALD Foundation.

326
00:33:03,656 --> 00:33:07,809
We heard about your boy Lorenzo,
and we'd like to offer you some help.

327
00:33:07,937 --> 00:33:09,734
You're a doctor?

328
00:33:09,857 --> 00:33:14,726
Doctor? Heck, no. I'm a machinist from
Allequippa, PA, but I'm an ALD parent.

329
00:33:14,857 --> 00:33:20,215
This is my second time around, so I know
exactly what you're going through.

330
00:33:21,337 --> 00:33:24,852
My wife Loretta and I,
we run the foundation.

331
00:33:25,817 --> 00:33:29,969
We organise counselling,
conduct seminars, fund research.

332
00:33:30,097 --> 00:33:32,487
We have 500 member families,
not only American,...

333
00:33:32,618 --> 00:33:36,657
but from Portugal,
Israel, Japan, Australia...

334
00:33:36,778 --> 00:33:39,497
And we're growing all the time.

335
00:33:39,618 --> 00:33:43,452
We wanted you and Mrs Odone
to know that you're not alone.

336
00:33:46,258 --> 00:33:49,216
ALD FAMILY CONFERENCE
July 1984

337
00:33:52,338 --> 00:33:55,216
Hi. Ellard Muscatine.
Welcome to the conference.

338
00:33:55,338 --> 00:33:57,648
Augusto Odone.
-Michaela.

339
00:33:57,779 --> 00:34:00,532
Oh, very nice to meet you.
Please come in.

340
00:34:01,659 --> 00:34:04,492
This is my wife Loretta,
and these are the Odones.

341
00:34:04,619 --> 00:34:07,179
Great. I'm so happy
you were able to come.

342
00:34:07,299 --> 00:34:10,450
Because I think a lot of it is denial.

343
00:34:10,579 --> 00:34:14,618
We don't want to say anything's going
on. We're strong and we can handle it.

344
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:19,218
But this is the place and
this is the time to let it all out,...

345
00:34:20,259 --> 00:34:22,410
let the barriers come down...

346
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:25,657
and to share your feelings
and get it off your chest.

347
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:29,329
It's hard to believe that
things can get worse.

348
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:33,016
But they will.

349
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:37,093
One thing nobody wants to
talk about is what happens,...

350
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:40,053
or does not happen, between
the two of you in the bedroom.

351
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:42,216
A whole year
we couldn't touch each other.

352
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:47,297
My husband stood by me all the way
but, oh my, does it test the men!

353
00:34:47,421 --> 00:34:50,458
And the weak ones just up and go.
-Even the strong ones leave.

354
00:34:50,581 --> 00:34:53,058
My guy hung in there when
our first boy took sick.

355
00:34:53,059 --> 00:34:54,938
Then we had
little Jake tested.

356
00:34:55,061 --> 00:34:58,258
Arlen wanted a whole bunch of boys,
a whole ball team.

357
00:34:58,381 --> 00:35:01,817
He's gonna have 'em too...
with some other gal.

358
00:35:03,141 --> 00:35:05,177
We'd like to thank the parents...

359
00:35:05,301 --> 00:35:09,180
who gave so generously to the fund
for the immunosuppression trial.

360
00:35:09,301 --> 00:35:12,533
The doctors have said that
this experiment contributed greatly...

361
00:35:12,662 --> 00:35:15,051
to the understanding of ALD.

362
00:35:15,182 --> 00:35:19,380
Betty and Tom Knowles,
$250 in memory of Corey.

363
00:35:19,502 --> 00:35:23,415
Dr and Mrs Liebowitz,
$500 in memory of Joel.

364
00:35:23,542 --> 00:35:28,332
Mr and Mrs Higgins,
$1,000 in memory of Adrian and Julian.

365
00:35:28,462 --> 00:35:32,250
26 people have sent in
recipes for the newsletter.

366
00:35:32,382 --> 00:35:35,852
Now, we still need ideas for
snack foods and breakfast treats.

367
00:35:35,982 --> 00:35:38,816
Remember, all recipes should be
low-fat...

368
00:35:38,943 --> 00:35:41,935
and use only the foods
allowed on the institute diet.

369
00:35:42,063 --> 00:35:44,133
Excuse me.
-Yes, ma'am?

370
00:35:44,263 --> 00:35:46,333
Our son has complied with this diet,...

371
00:35:46,463 --> 00:35:51,378
but his levels of saturated C24 and
C26 have risen for two months in a row.

372
00:35:51,503 --> 00:35:53,778
That's exactly what's
happened to Jaybird.

373
00:35:53,903 --> 00:35:57,612
Ah, well, perhaps before we talk
about publishing cookbooks,...

374
00:35:57,743 --> 00:36:02,534
we should ask ourselves
if the diet is working at all.

375
00:36:04,344 --> 00:36:06,904
Shouldn't we?
-Damn right we should.

376
00:36:07,024 --> 00:36:08,980
This is not the way we do things here.

377
00:36:09,104 --> 00:36:13,814
But there are two families here
with this paradox. Maybe there are more.

378
00:36:13,944 --> 00:36:15,935
Shouldn't we open it for discussion?

379
00:36:16,064 --> 00:36:19,374
My boy's levels are rising.
-Now there are three families.

380
00:36:19,504 --> 00:36:23,133
So maybe we should...
Could we have a show of hands?

381
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:25,459
Then we'll see how many
families there are.

382
00:36:25,584 --> 00:36:27,496
You don't understand. This
is a formal pilot study.

383
00:36:27,497 --> 00:36:29,703
It has to run
for full six months.

384
00:36:29,825 --> 00:36:32,623
We're not scientists.
We don't interpret experiments.

385
00:36:32,745 --> 00:36:35,464
That's the solemn
responsibility of the doctors.

386
00:36:35,585 --> 00:36:37,860
Come on, Ellard!
Let's have a show of hands.

387
00:36:37,985 --> 00:36:39,941
No, that would be misleading.

388
00:36:40,065 --> 00:36:43,216
The medical folks call
this kind of evidence anecdotal.

389
00:36:43,345 --> 00:36:46,621
What's wrong with a show of hands?
-It wouldn't have any meaning.

390
00:36:46,745 --> 00:36:49,384
Excuse me. May I say something?
-Sure.

391
00:36:49,505 --> 00:36:51,751
The only way that the doctors can get

392
00:36:51,752 --> 00:36:54,705
useful results is with
a strict protocol...

393
00:36:54,826 --> 00:36:57,465
and statistical samples
in a control group.

394
00:36:57,586 --> 00:37:00,225
And a proper time frame.
Doctors have to be careful.

395
00:37:00,346 --> 00:37:03,463
Clinical trials must withstand
a tremendous amount of scrutiny.

396
00:37:03,586 --> 00:37:06,180
This is the way that
medical science works.

397
00:37:06,306 --> 00:37:09,821
That's the only way the scientists
can get the information they need.

398
00:37:09,946 --> 00:37:12,248
So what you're saying
is that our children

399
00:37:12,249 --> 00:37:15,862
are in the service
of medical science.

400
00:37:15,986 --> 00:37:17,943
How foolish of me.
I always assumed...

401
00:37:18,067 --> 00:37:21,776
that medical science
was in the service of the sufferers.

402
00:37:21,907 --> 00:37:23,863
Yes. Uh, thank you.

403
00:37:24,587 --> 00:37:27,181
Uh, now I think it's time
we get back to our agenda.

404
00:37:27,307 --> 00:37:32,779
Why? So we can discuss further salvaging
our marriages and managing our grief?

405
00:37:32,907 --> 00:37:37,344
What about the children?
No one here is discussing the children.

406
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:40,742
Thank you.

407
00:37:40,867 --> 00:37:45,180
Now if Mary has nothing further to add,
I would like to introduce Dr Chapel...

408
00:37:45,308 --> 00:37:48,061
to talk about the nasogastric tube
and suction machine.

409
00:37:48,188 --> 00:37:51,498
Would you all join me
in giving him a very warm welcome?

410
00:37:58,468 --> 00:38:02,222
Thank you, Madam President. Thank
you, Ellard. Ladies and gentlemen...

411
00:38:03,348 --> 00:38:05,304
August 1984

412
00:38:21,029 --> 00:38:23,987
Now hold my hand.
-Yes, sweetie.

413
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:45,226
Now the story.
-What story is that, sweetheart?

414
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:49,507
La notte di San Lorenzo.

415
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:51,348
San Lorenzo, who is...?

416
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:53,620
My patron saint.

417
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:56,822
And saint of my father's village.

418
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:59,590
That's right. And what happened to him?

419
00:38:59,711 --> 00:39:02,066
He was in Rome.

420
00:39:05,071 --> 00:39:07,505
And... I forgot.

421
00:39:08,791 --> 00:39:11,100
Well, many years ago...

422
00:39:11,231 --> 00:39:16,624
the bad guy says to him
"Bring us the riches of your church."

423
00:39:17,551 --> 00:39:23,502
And Lorenzo, he brings them
the beggars and the sick people...

424
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:28,460
and he says...
-"These are our riches."

425
00:39:28,592 --> 00:39:29,945
Yes!

426
00:39:30,072 --> 00:39:34,588
Bravo, Lorenzo, bravo.
-That's wonderful, sweetheart. So clever.

427
00:39:34,712 --> 00:39:37,351
And tonight, August 10th, is...

428
00:39:38,032 --> 00:39:42,628
La notte di San Lorenzo.

429
00:39:43,312 --> 00:39:45,507
The night
of the shooting stars.

430
00:39:45,632 --> 00:39:47,987
When anything can happen.

431
00:40:13,513 --> 00:40:14,913
Micha...

432
00:40:15,034 --> 00:40:16,990
Sh, sh, sh.

433
00:40:18,114 --> 00:40:21,993
When we first went to the Comoros,
what did we do?

434
00:40:23,554 --> 00:40:26,193
We got to know the country, right?
-Yes.

435
00:40:26,314 --> 00:40:30,546
We studied. We got to know
the language, resources, its laws.

436
00:40:30,674 --> 00:40:32,630
We studied, right?

437
00:40:33,474 --> 00:40:37,467
We should treat Lorenzo's illness
like another country.

438
00:40:37,594 --> 00:40:40,428
I don't quite see the analogy.
-All right, all right.

439
00:40:40,555 --> 00:40:43,228
ALD has many dimensions, right?
-Yes.

440
00:40:43,355 --> 00:40:49,146
So in order to understand it, we need
a command of genetics, biochemistry,...

441
00:40:49,275 --> 00:40:52,347
microbiology, neurology, ology-ology...

442
00:40:52,475 --> 00:40:54,989
Augusto, we don't have time
to go to medical school.

443
00:40:55,115 --> 00:40:59,154
Michaela, the doctors are in the dark.
They're groping in the dark.

444
00:40:59,275 --> 00:41:02,585
They've got Lorenzo
on a turvy-topsy diet.

445
00:41:02,715 --> 00:41:07,744
And that bloody immunosuppression
is brutal and useless.

446
00:41:07,876 --> 00:41:12,631
Michaela, we should not have
consigned him blindly into their hands.

447
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:16,713
He should not suffer by our ignorance.

448
00:41:16,836 --> 00:41:20,988
We take responsibility.
So... we read a little.

449
00:41:21,916 --> 00:41:24,476
And we go out and inform ourselves.

450
00:41:25,876 --> 00:41:30,428
But... to miss time with him
while he can still speak to us...

451
00:41:30,557 --> 00:41:34,709
Yes, I know, I know.
But he expects it of us.

452
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:50,193
THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH
Bethesda

453
00:42:05,078 --> 00:42:08,434
September 1984
Five Months After Diagnosis

454
00:42:20,039 --> 00:42:22,633
I want to take Lorenzo off the diet.

455
00:42:22,759 --> 00:42:26,274
He's been eating cardboard for 19 weeks,
and what's it getting us?

456
00:42:26,399 --> 00:42:30,677
And feed him what?
-Normal foods. Things a child likes.

457
00:42:30,799 --> 00:42:33,916
Full of the long-chain fats
that we know destroy his myelin?

458
00:42:34,039 --> 00:42:37,827
Look. On the diet,
his blood fats are still rising.

459
00:42:37,959 --> 00:42:40,473
Yes, I know, Michaela.
-It doesn't make any sense.

460
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:43,557
But we don't know enough.
We don't know enough.

461
00:42:43,679 --> 00:42:45,910
We don't know it clearly enough.

462
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:48,235
Here, Michaela,
let me show you something.

463
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:50,316
All right, here.

464
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,356
Un piccolo acquaio.

465
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:57,075
A kitchen sink?
-Yes, yes. Little kitchen sink.

466
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,397
All right. Now here is the tap.

467
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:03,398
And here's the sink basin
and the plughole, right?

468
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:09,038
All right. Very long-chain saturated fats
are introduced by what we eat, right?

469
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:11,675
Yes?
-Now, also produced by the body...

470
00:43:11,801 --> 00:43:15,316
or manufactured by the body,
these very same fats.

471
00:43:15,441 --> 00:43:18,035
Biosynthesis.
-Biosynthesis, right.

472
00:43:18,161 --> 00:43:20,311
Now, normally they are not harmful...

473
00:43:20,441 --> 00:43:25,037
because this enzyme
eliminate the excess, right?

474
00:43:25,641 --> 00:43:30,112
But in Lorenzo, this enzyme
is defective from genetics.

475
00:43:30,241 --> 00:43:33,278
His plughole is blocked, right?

476
00:43:33,401 --> 00:43:34,436
Yes.

477
00:43:34,561 --> 00:43:38,874
We know that very long-chain saturated
fats are made up of carbon atoms.

478
00:43:39,002 --> 00:43:42,074
C2, 4, 6, 8...
all the way up the chain, right?

479
00:43:42,922 --> 00:43:49,157
But in Lorenzo,
the saturated C24 and C26...

480
00:43:49,282 --> 00:43:52,558
rise to four times the normal level.

481
00:43:54,402 --> 00:43:59,351
OK, now, here's where we have
a little paradox, a mystery, OK?

482
00:44:00,642 --> 00:44:05,512
Why, when we reduce the dietary intake
of saturated fats,...

483
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:10,592
does the level in our sink, which
we would expect to go down, go up?

484
00:44:11,243 --> 00:44:14,838
So, logically, we should
take him off the diet.

485
00:44:14,963 --> 00:44:17,113
Well, Michaela,...

486
00:44:17,243 --> 00:44:20,121
just as logically, we should not.

487
00:44:20,243 --> 00:44:22,632
Because let's not do
what the doctors did.

488
00:44:22,763 --> 00:44:25,436
Let's not act without knowing why.

489
00:44:26,604 --> 00:44:31,439
Why, when we turn off this tap,
does the level in our sink rise?

490
00:44:34,164 --> 00:44:35,722
I married a plumber.

491
00:44:35,844 --> 00:44:40,554
You married a man with a simple mind,
who asks simple questions, that's all.

492
00:44:40,684 --> 00:44:42,720
Here, Michaela. Brain food.

493
00:44:42,844 --> 00:44:45,074
Come on.
-Oh. Thank you.

494
00:44:48,084 --> 00:44:50,040
October 1984

495
00:45:41,567 --> 00:45:45,606
Polish rats! I think I have
an explanation for the paradox.

496
00:45:45,727 --> 00:45:48,082
Lorenzo, kiss your clever mother.

497
00:45:48,727 --> 00:45:54,199
Polish rats with a fatty-acid storage
disease. Let me use your kitchen sink.

498
00:45:56,447 --> 00:45:59,678
Here's our tap for what we eat.

499
00:46:01,607 --> 00:46:03,962
And here's our tap for biosynthesis.

500
00:46:04,087 --> 00:46:06,237
I see.
Biosynthesis.

501
00:46:07,528 --> 00:46:11,885
When the rats were deprived
of a specific fat in their diet,...

502
00:46:12,008 --> 00:46:15,796
their body cells compensated
by overproducing it.

503
00:46:15,928 --> 00:46:19,125
So if this holds true for humans...
-Then the diet is useless...

504
00:46:19,248 --> 00:46:23,207
unless we can stop it overproducing,
slow down biosynthesis, s ì?

505
00:46:23,328 --> 00:46:27,685
Yes, and there's more. And for this,
I deserve two kisses, my darling.

506
00:46:29,288 --> 00:46:32,998
In the summary, it talks about
the concept of fatty-acid manipulation.

507
00:46:33,129 --> 00:46:34,960
What's that?
-Well,...

508
00:46:35,089 --> 00:46:38,843
they stop the rats
producing one kind of fat...

509
00:46:40,249 --> 00:46:42,558
by loading their diet with another kind.

510
00:46:42,689 --> 00:46:47,399
So maybe we could stop Lorenzo's body
from producing C24 and C26...

511
00:46:47,529 --> 00:46:51,681
by loading his diet with another kind
of fat, one that's less harmful.

512
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:54,562
We should have this translated
as soon as possible.

513
00:46:54,689 --> 00:46:57,648
I have some news too.

514
00:46:57,770 --> 00:46:59,886
It's a letter from Omouri.

515
00:47:00,010 --> 00:47:03,127
He wouldn't open it until you got home.

516
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:05,605
Omouri.
-Yes.

517
00:47:11,290 --> 00:47:13,326
Michaela, by tomorrow morning,...

518
00:47:13,450 --> 00:47:17,409
your Polish rats will be
speaking to us in English. Hm?

519
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:21,086
I've been thinking.

520
00:47:23,051 --> 00:47:27,124
I found that article by accident.
I just as easily could have missed it.

521
00:47:27,251 --> 00:47:31,802
It was written by a Polish biochemist,
who I'm sure knew nothing about ALD.

522
00:47:33,211 --> 00:47:36,886
Well, Michaela, still it gives us
a new line of inquiry.

523
00:47:37,011 --> 00:47:38,842
Yes, but it could take months.

524
00:47:38,971 --> 00:47:42,759
And there will be other leads that take
more time, and it's time we don't have.

525
00:47:42,891 --> 00:47:49,365
All these experts, working in isolation,
each one on his own piece of the jigsaw.

526
00:47:51,292 --> 00:47:53,738
Of course, a symposium
is the best way

527
00:47:53,739 --> 00:47:55,922
to accelerate the
exchange of information.

528
00:47:56,052 --> 00:47:59,044
In that sense,
it's a very good idea, Mr Odone.

529
00:47:59,172 --> 00:48:01,322
Only... May I say something?

530
00:48:02,252 --> 00:48:06,530
Have you any idea how many children
in the United States die every year...

531
00:48:06,652 --> 00:48:09,485
from choking on French fries?

532
00:48:09,612 --> 00:48:13,891
Many more than from
adrenoleukodystrophy.

533
00:48:14,013 --> 00:48:16,402
Ours is what is known as
an orphan disease.

534
00:48:16,533 --> 00:48:20,321
It's too small to be noticed,
too small to be funded,...

535
00:48:20,453 --> 00:48:23,889
especially with the iron hand
of Reaganomics.

536
00:48:24,013 --> 00:48:29,212
So while, as I say, this remains a very
good idea, it's a luxury we can't afford.

537
00:48:29,333 --> 00:48:33,531
Well, we appreciate that,
so we have prepared a budget...

538
00:48:33,653 --> 00:48:35,962
based on 40 participants for two days.

539
00:48:36,093 --> 00:48:40,292
We think it can be done for $35,000.
My wife and I will raise the money.

540
00:48:40,414 --> 00:48:43,611
We can't ask you to bear the cost.
-Oh, no, no, no.

541
00:48:43,734 --> 00:48:46,248
That's the least of our concern.

542
00:48:46,374 --> 00:48:49,446
And of course, your institute
will not be at risk...

543
00:48:49,574 --> 00:48:54,125
because the Odones
will underwrite any shortfall.

544
00:48:55,374 --> 00:48:59,049
And we took the liberty
of drafting an invitation list.

545
00:48:59,174 --> 00:49:02,610
Forgive me, Dr Nikolais.
We wish to make two conditions.

546
00:49:02,734 --> 00:49:06,887
We would like the symposium
to emphasise therapy,...

547
00:49:07,015 --> 00:49:11,964
and Michaela and myself would like
to participate in the discussion.

548
00:49:21,175 --> 00:49:25,054
Martha, I'm afraid we'll have to
add to your workload,...

549
00:49:25,175 --> 00:49:27,894
but it's in a very good cause.

550
00:49:28,015 --> 00:49:32,089
We've decided to convene
the first symposium on ALD.

551
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:35,775
We should notify the Muscatines.

552
00:49:35,896 --> 00:49:39,332
Of course. The foundation could
help with the arrangement.

553
00:49:39,456 --> 00:49:43,734
They could even, perhaps...
find some funds.

554
00:49:45,376 --> 00:49:49,654
How about we hook it to the back of
the next Foundation Family Conference?

555
00:49:49,776 --> 00:49:52,768
When would that be?
-Next summer. 4th of July.

556
00:49:52,896 --> 00:49:55,730
That's nine months away!
-It will take us all that time...

557
00:49:55,857 --> 00:49:58,451
to invite those busy doctors
and raise the money.

558
00:49:58,577 --> 00:50:01,728
I don't think so.
-What's your time frame, Mrs Odone?

559
00:50:01,857 --> 00:50:05,088
Five weeks from now. November 10th.
-That's not possible.

560
00:50:05,217 --> 00:50:06,855
Oh, I think it is.

561
00:50:06,977 --> 00:50:09,047
Pardon me,
but what is the point of rushing?

562
00:50:11,497 --> 00:50:15,410
As ALD parents, we both know
the answer to that inane question.

563
00:50:15,537 --> 00:50:18,574
If you want this to happen,
you're going about it the wrong way.

564
00:50:18,697 --> 00:50:21,451
At least we are going about it.

565
00:50:21,578 --> 00:50:24,376
Sorry, I don't understand.
-He wants his diaper changed.

566
00:50:24,498 --> 00:50:27,649
Mrs Muscatine, look... Hello?

567
00:50:28,578 --> 00:50:30,455
Hello?

568
00:50:30,578 --> 00:50:33,456
They should be hung by their eyelashes.

569
00:50:33,578 --> 00:50:35,967
They won't help?
-It doesn't look that way.

570
00:50:36,098 --> 00:50:38,054
Good boy. I'll take him.
-No, I got it.

571
00:50:38,178 --> 00:50:40,976
What'll you do? Mortgage the house?
-Not until I have to.

572
00:50:41,098 --> 00:50:42,531
Michaela!

573
00:50:51,859 --> 00:50:55,135
I've spent two months pulling
on the heartstrings of Washington...

574
00:50:55,259 --> 00:50:59,696
to raise money for multiple sclerosis,
sudden infant death and cystic fibrosis.

575
00:50:59,819 --> 00:51:01,969
Then why exclude adrenoleukodystrophy?

576
00:51:02,099 --> 00:51:06,012
Because I also cover politics,
the arts, women's issues and stuff,...

577
00:51:06,139 --> 00:51:08,778
and my readership likes
to have a little balance.

578
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:13,451
I cannot do another medical story
right now. Maybe in another month.

579
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:17,740
Joyce, I think you should meet my son.

580
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:24,056
My friends...

581
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:27,209
This is so generous.

582
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:31,128
You know, Augusto, our wives
are eager to form a committee...

583
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:34,856
to, perhaps, help with hospitality.
-Oh, wonderful, wonderful.

584
00:51:37,621 --> 00:51:41,136
Not only will we be saving money,
but they'll be extremely well fed.

585
00:51:41,261 --> 00:51:45,095
For breakfast, French pastry, correct?
Lunch, UN finger food.

586
00:51:45,221 --> 00:51:48,213
The British will do afternoon tea.

587
00:51:48,341 --> 00:51:51,777
And for dinner, I know
a marvellous Italian cook.

588
00:51:54,621 --> 00:51:56,520
Are you needin'
another pair of hands?

589
00:51:56,521 --> 00:51:58,819
I'll lick envelopes,
serve coffee, whatever.

590
00:51:58,941 --> 00:52:02,571
And this is for your boy. I grow
the best organic produce in Virginia.

591
00:52:02,702 --> 00:52:05,421
Thank you.
-You don't remember me!

592
00:52:05,542 --> 00:52:09,660
Wendy Gimble. Foundation Family
Conference. I yelled louder than you.

593
00:52:09,782 --> 00:52:15,015
Yes, of course. You have two boys.
-We lost Jaybird, but Jake here is fine.

594
00:52:15,142 --> 00:52:17,133
We think what you're doing is fantastic.

595
00:52:17,262 --> 00:52:19,412
Hello, Jake. Come on in. Thank you.

596
00:52:19,542 --> 00:52:24,377
When I read about what you were doing,
I thought "It's time we did something."

597
00:52:24,502 --> 00:52:28,132
Please, come in and meet the others.
-Is that Lorenzo?

598
00:52:28,263 --> 00:52:32,302
Yes. Lorenzo, this is Jake.
He's a young man of your age.

599
00:52:32,423 --> 00:52:37,019
Look, Lorenzo, a great big pumpkin.
Let's go down and feel how big it is.

600
00:52:41,263 --> 00:52:43,572
What, sweetheart?

601
00:52:45,943 --> 00:52:49,015
I'm sorry, Lorenzo.
Let's try that again.

602
00:53:11,304 --> 00:53:13,772
This morning I could
still understand him.

603
00:53:19,665 --> 00:53:24,500
When we can clone the ALD gene,
we can identify the deficient enzyme,...

604
00:53:24,625 --> 00:53:27,856
mass-produce the gene,
implant it into ALD sufferers...

605
00:53:27,985 --> 00:53:31,944
and normalise their metabolism.
-How long would that take?

606
00:53:32,345 --> 00:53:35,781
FIRST INTERNATIONAL ALD SYMPOSIUM
November 10th 1984

607
00:53:36,825 --> 00:53:38,577
Seven to ten years.

608
00:53:38,705 --> 00:53:41,459
You see, science has its own time,...

609
00:53:41,586 --> 00:53:44,976
and, very often, any new advance
can be a matter of serendipity.

610
00:53:45,106 --> 00:53:48,735
For the last six months, all
our ALD boys have been on a regimen...

611
00:53:48,866 --> 00:53:52,905
which excludes saturated C24 and 26.

612
00:53:53,666 --> 00:53:56,464
But despite this
restriction in the diet,...

613
00:53:56,586 --> 00:54:00,625
these long-chain fatty acids
have remained the same,...

614
00:54:00,746 --> 00:54:03,499
in some cases even increasing.

615
00:54:04,226 --> 00:54:09,426
Now, this compensating increase
I put down to biosynthesis.

616
00:54:09,547 --> 00:54:12,744
But, Gus, if you could
maintain the diet...

617
00:54:12,867 --> 00:54:16,382
and somehow inhibit biosynthesis,
you'd have a therapy.

618
00:54:16,507 --> 00:54:18,862
No, you wouldn't quite have a therapy.

619
00:54:18,987 --> 00:54:22,900
You would have a way of
lowering the fatty acids to normal.

620
00:54:30,507 --> 00:54:33,818
If you wish to inhibit biosynthesis,...

621
00:54:33,948 --> 00:54:37,463
have you considered
fatty-acid manipulation?

622
00:54:46,548 --> 00:54:51,417
There is some literature,
a rat study, Russian or Polish.

623
00:54:51,548 --> 00:54:54,267
Polish. Straszak.
I have copies right here.

624
00:54:54,388 --> 00:54:58,462
Polish Journal of Biological Sciences
1979, Volume I I.

625
00:54:58,589 --> 00:55:02,662
They loaded the diet with one fat
and decreased biosynthesis of another.

626
00:55:02,789 --> 00:55:05,622
Yes, I remember this article.

627
00:55:05,749 --> 00:55:10,618
And also in Canada, they have seen
the same thing in miniature swine.

628
00:55:10,749 --> 00:55:13,900
As a matter of fact,
I've seen it in human cells.

629
00:55:14,029 --> 00:55:15,985
In human ALD cells.

630
00:55:16,109 --> 00:55:20,660
From patients with ALD,
I took fibroblasts -skin cells, OK?

631
00:55:20,789 --> 00:55:22,906
Each one carries the same genetic defect.

632
00:55:23,030 --> 00:55:27,660
I incubated them with oleic acid and
reduced the saturated C24 and C26...

633
00:55:27,790 --> 00:55:30,258
by more than 50 percent.
-Excuse me, Doctor.

634
00:55:30,390 --> 00:55:32,984
You said oleic acid?

635
00:55:33,390 --> 00:55:36,587
Yes, monounsaturated C18,
the main component of olive oil.

636
00:55:36,710 --> 00:55:39,907
Surely this is the basis for a therapy.
-Slow down.

637
00:55:40,030 --> 00:55:43,943
These are studies in cultured cells. We
don't know it'll work in a human being.

638
00:55:44,070 --> 00:55:47,984
Well, then, take the olive oil
and try it in a patient and see...

639
00:55:48,111 --> 00:55:52,741
Augusto, olive oil is forbidden
in the diet: C24, C26.

640
00:55:52,871 --> 00:55:56,546
Yes, but then use whatever
Dr Rizzo fed his fibroblast.

641
00:55:56,671 --> 00:56:01,540
Pure oleic acid would be very toxic to
an intact organism, an animal or human.

642
00:56:01,671 --> 00:56:03,486
It would need to be
the triglyceride form,

643
00:56:03,487 --> 00:56:06,301
which is edible,
but that's not available.

644
00:56:06,431 --> 00:56:10,947
All right, can't you take ordinary
olive oil and extract the C24 and C26?

645
00:56:11,071 --> 00:56:15,827
You could, but it's a very complicated
procedure and would be very expensive,...

646
00:56:15,952 --> 00:56:19,069
especially to produce the quantities
for a clinical trial.

647
00:56:19,192 --> 00:56:21,308
Have you contacted chemical companies?

648
00:56:21,432 --> 00:56:23,388
No one will tool up for that.

649
00:56:23,512 --> 00:56:27,869
Not for an experiment,
not for something with no market.

650
00:56:27,992 --> 00:56:30,347
Then you haven't tried?
-No.

651
00:56:35,192 --> 00:56:40,267
If we were able to get triglyceride,
then we can change all that, right?

652
00:56:40,393 --> 00:56:43,191
Yes. It has to be triglyceride
to be edible.

653
00:56:43,313 --> 00:56:45,304
Edible form. Triglyceride.

654
00:56:45,433 --> 00:56:47,344
No one here can help you.

655
00:56:47,473 --> 00:56:49,782
Then do you know anyone else who does?

656
00:56:49,913 --> 00:56:52,029
I'll send you back to the switchboard.

657
00:56:52,153 --> 00:56:56,146
Which extension, please?
-Research and development.

658
00:56:56,273 --> 00:56:57,228
R&D.

659
00:56:57,353 --> 00:57:00,470
I need a triglyceride form of oleic acid.
-Your name, Doctor?

660
00:57:00,593 --> 00:57:02,903
No, I'm not a doctor.
-Are you with a company?

661
00:57:03,034 --> 00:57:06,265
No, I am not with any company.
I'm the mother of a sick child.

662
00:57:06,394 --> 00:57:07,668
A mother?
-That's right.

663
00:57:07,794 --> 00:57:09,466
And you want...?
-Oleic acid.

664
00:57:09,594 --> 00:57:11,186
The lines are busy.
-I'll wait.

665
00:57:11,314 --> 00:57:14,511
Papa makes you
spaghetti al pomodoro,...

666
00:57:14,634 --> 00:57:19,230
seasoned with basilico,
the royal herb for our prince.

667
00:57:19,354 --> 00:57:21,788
Badabib, badabab, badaboom.

668
00:57:23,314 --> 00:57:26,989
Come on, Lorenzo, take a little bit.
That's a boy.

669
00:57:27,114 --> 00:57:29,549
The best lead
came from the symposium:

670
00:57:29,675 --> 00:57:33,873
oleic acid in the triglyceride form.
Now it's our only hope for Lorenzo.

671
00:57:33,995 --> 00:57:37,590
Don't fret, Mrs Odone.
You will hear from him within the hour.

672
00:57:37,715 --> 00:57:40,309
You can be sure of it.
-Thank you. That's 301...

673
00:57:40,435 --> 00:57:42,266
Don't worry, I have the number.

674
00:57:42,395 --> 00:57:45,546
Thank you very much.
-You're welcome. Bye-bye.

675
00:57:49,395 --> 00:57:55,346
So, as the swallowing reflexes weaken,
he's less able to handle his own saliva.

676
00:57:56,116 --> 00:58:00,985
We'll all have to be pretty vigilant. We
really have to stay on top of this thing.

677
00:58:01,116 --> 00:58:03,209
If we allow any
saliva to get down

678
00:58:03,210 --> 00:58:05,792
into his respiratory tract,
we compromise his airway.

679
00:58:05,916 --> 00:58:07,952
We don't wanna do that.

680
00:58:08,076 --> 00:58:10,067
Here we go. Put your
thumb over the valve.

681
00:58:10,196 --> 00:58:12,585
When you don't want suction,
release your thumb.

682
00:58:12,716 --> 00:58:17,073
Hi. It's ProtoChem again.
I'll connect you to our Mr Pellerman.

683
00:58:17,596 --> 00:58:19,952
PROTOCHEM LABORATORIES
Cleveland

684
00:58:24,117 --> 00:58:27,996
I believe you want some oleic acid.
-Yes, in triglyceride form.

685
00:58:28,117 --> 00:58:30,289
You're lucky.
We're testing a glycerol

686
00:58:30,290 --> 00:58:32,156
trioleate here as an
industrial lubricant.

687
00:58:32,277 --> 00:58:35,508
Industrial? Then... is it fit
for human consumption?

688
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:37,753
I don't see why not.
It's a purified olive oil.

689
00:58:37,877 --> 00:58:42,871
Without saturates? Pure monounsaturated
C18 in triglyceride form?

690
00:58:42,997 --> 00:58:44,590
Yes, ma'am.
-You're sure?

691
00:58:44,718 --> 00:58:47,790
It happens we have one bottle here,
sitting idle on the shelf.

692
00:58:47,918 --> 00:58:50,990
Marvellous! How can we
get our hands on it?

693
00:58:51,118 --> 00:58:53,427
Sorry. Go ahead.
-How can we get our hands on it?

694
00:58:54,838 --> 00:58:56,794
This is... beautiful.

695
00:58:57,518 --> 00:59:01,147
And it's entirely harmless?
-Gus, you're talking to an Italian.

696
00:59:01,278 --> 00:59:05,669
It's only olive oil. -Yes, that's
harmless. It's like... sugar.

697
00:59:05,798 --> 00:59:08,552
And yet, to a diabetic,
sugar can be lethal.

698
00:59:08,679 --> 00:59:13,514
You see, the trouble is we don't know to
what extent Lorenzo can metabolise fats.

699
00:59:13,639 --> 00:59:18,713
Yes, well, Gus, it's been seven months
since Lorenzo was diagnosed.

700
00:59:18,839 --> 00:59:21,399
Now he is silent. He's immobile.

701
00:59:22,359 --> 00:59:24,395
Augusto, I am a scientist,...

702
00:59:24,519 --> 00:59:27,716
and I'm of absolutely
no use to you whatever...

703
00:59:27,839 --> 00:59:30,148
unless I can maintain my ob jectivity.

704
00:59:30,279 --> 00:59:33,430
And I am not a scientist. I am a father.

705
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:37,997
And nobody can tell me what dressing
I put on my kid's salad, OK?

706
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:42,316
Augusto...

707
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:46,396
This science of medicine.
You know, it's not like physics.

708
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:49,637
There's no mathematical certainty.

709
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:55,392
And because we deal with human beings
who suffer, it can appear heartless.

710
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:57,476
I know.

711
01:00:01,721 --> 01:00:05,873
You realise that any collaboration
of mine would have to be unofficial?

712
01:00:06,001 --> 01:00:10,233
Sì, s ì, of course. Now, the dose.
We think 40 grams a day.

713
01:00:10,361 --> 01:00:13,273
That's too much. Say 30.
-30?

714
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:17,155
Yes. Any more than that
might damage your son's liver.

715
01:00:17,281 --> 01:00:19,431
Darling, they're about to start.

716
01:00:22,161 --> 01:00:26,280
We're going to send this blood away
to establish a baseline, my brave boy.

717
01:00:26,402 --> 01:00:30,475
Because today we all start
the fight against the boo-boo.

718
01:00:30,602 --> 01:00:32,877
There. All done.

719
01:00:35,842 --> 01:00:39,994
Lorenzino, this year we celebrate
Thanksgiving a little early...

720
01:00:40,122 --> 01:00:44,081
with a fine barracuda
like we used to eat in the Comoros, huh?

721
01:00:44,202 --> 01:00:47,638
And Papa has cooked it
with the aromatic dill.

722
01:00:47,762 --> 01:00:49,719
And now...

723
01:00:50,923 --> 01:00:55,360
we add the special olive oil
which Mama found.

724
01:00:55,483 --> 01:00:57,439
Hm? All right?

725
01:00:59,323 --> 01:01:01,234
There we go.

726
01:01:01,363 --> 01:01:02,955
Deirdre.

727
01:01:03,083 --> 01:01:05,961
All right, Lorenzo. Here we go.

728
01:01:22,284 --> 01:01:24,434
November 21st 1984

729
01:01:27,244 --> 01:01:29,200
One Month Later

730
01:01:30,684 --> 01:01:35,633
There we go.
-You did good, buddy boy. Real good.

731
01:01:35,764 --> 01:01:40,043
Your Aunt Deirdre means "well", darling.
In this house, we cherish our adverbs.

732
01:01:40,165 --> 01:01:43,714
I expect you to do the same
when you get your voice back.

733
01:02:22,766 --> 01:02:25,724
Hello?
-Mrs Odone, this is Dr Nikolais's office.

734
01:02:25,846 --> 01:02:30,204
I have Lorenzo's results. There's been a
small drop in the saturated C24 and 26.

735
01:02:30,327 --> 01:02:32,363
About 15 percent.
-15 percent?

736
01:02:32,487 --> 01:02:36,719
Dr Nikolais said not to get carried away.
It could be a spontaneous variation.

737
01:02:36,847 --> 01:02:40,635
Am I allowed a tiny squeak of joy?
-We'll know more next month.

738
01:02:40,767 --> 01:02:41,916
Thank you.

739
01:03:05,008 --> 01:03:06,919
Michaela!

740
01:03:12,848 --> 01:03:15,442
Augusto! Get something
to hold down his tongue!

741
01:03:15,568 --> 01:03:17,524
Oh, my baby!

742
01:03:25,449 --> 01:03:29,328
So, this is a kind of seizure,
like epilepsy?

743
01:03:29,449 --> 01:03:33,840
No, not a seizure. It's a paroxysm.
It's triggered by saliva in the windpipe.

744
01:03:33,969 --> 01:03:36,164
But we suction him.
-Regularly.

745
01:03:36,289 --> 01:03:39,201
I know, but even so, some saliva
gets caught in the trachea.

746
01:03:39,329 --> 01:03:42,082
In any other child,
a cough would get rid of it.

747
01:03:42,209 --> 01:03:44,962
In Lorenzo, it becomes
a scrambled chain of reflexes...

748
01:03:45,089 --> 01:03:48,207
that amplifies into
what you have just seen.

749
01:03:48,330 --> 01:03:51,003
If this happens again,
what can we do about it?

750
01:03:51,130 --> 01:03:53,280
Just help him try to ride it out.

751
01:03:54,130 --> 01:03:57,566
We're all flying blind here, folks.
The best I can offer is sedation.

752
01:03:57,690 --> 01:04:03,242
But if it's not epilepsy, then he's aware
of what's happening while it's going on?

753
01:04:03,370 --> 01:04:05,326
Well, it's possible.

754
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:09,963
And if he has another episode,
we could talk him through it.

755
01:04:10,090 --> 01:04:12,161
It's possible, Michaela.

756
01:04:12,291 --> 01:04:14,247
It's possible.

757
01:04:16,371 --> 01:04:19,886
A 50 percent drop, right?
-That's correct.

758
01:04:20,011 --> 01:04:21,842
Thank you very much. Thank you!

759
01:04:21,971 --> 01:04:24,121
Fantastico! Fantastico!

760
01:04:24,851 --> 01:04:26,807
January 1985

761
01:04:34,531 --> 01:04:39,287
I very well understand that we are not
scientists, but we have observed this...

762
01:04:39,412 --> 01:04:43,724
Let us do it our way,
Augusto. Trust us.

763
01:04:43,852 --> 01:04:45,843
I've got to go.
-OK. Thank you.

764
01:04:45,972 --> 01:04:47,371
Goodbye.

765
01:04:47,492 --> 01:04:51,610
Nikolais says it's very interesting.
-Interesting? A 50 percent drop?

766
01:04:51,732 --> 01:04:55,327
But it's too early to draw a conclusion.
Rizzo might consider a trial.

767
01:04:55,452 --> 01:04:58,569
And he asked us
not to tell the other parents.

768
01:04:58,692 --> 01:05:01,252
What?!
-It's immoral. Something finally...

769
01:05:01,373 --> 01:05:04,763
The parents have to know.
-We'll tell them. They can judge.

770
01:05:04,893 --> 01:05:08,329
The foundation has a mailing list.
-We'll call the Muscatines.

771
01:05:08,453 --> 01:05:11,411
I can eat crow
in the name of a good cause.

772
01:05:14,173 --> 01:05:16,129
Michaela...

773
01:05:18,973 --> 01:05:23,489
Mm! Delicious! That was worth
driving 300 miles for.

774
01:05:23,613 --> 01:05:27,368
Now, my friends... dessert.
-Here, let me move this.

775
01:05:28,414 --> 01:05:31,167
And Loretta... a little science, hm?

776
01:05:31,974 --> 01:05:33,930
Thank you.

777
01:05:34,814 --> 01:05:36,770
"Dear ALD parents"

778
01:05:45,334 --> 01:05:49,373
You want us to send this out?
-Yes. We'll pay for copying and postage.

779
01:05:50,014 --> 01:05:51,971
But you're advocating a therapy.

780
01:05:52,095 --> 01:05:56,407
No, we're merely reporting
a positive advancement in the diet.

781
01:05:56,535 --> 01:05:59,049
It would be wrong to keep it
from the other parents.

782
01:05:59,175 --> 01:06:03,088
Mrs Odone, we have an advisory board
of eminent doctors...

783
01:06:03,215 --> 01:06:05,251
and we take our guidance from them.

784
01:06:05,375 --> 01:06:07,650
They are the ones
with the medical degrees.

785
01:06:07,775 --> 01:06:11,484
Yes, my dear, but Nikolais
already knows about this...

786
01:06:11,615 --> 01:06:15,893
and the wretched man does nothing.
-Because he is a responsible scientist.

787
01:06:16,015 --> 01:06:20,532
No, because he has another agenda.
-All right, Michaela. Calmati, calmati.

788
01:06:20,656 --> 01:06:23,011
You know, Loretta, sometimes...

789
01:06:24,296 --> 01:06:29,609
the interest of the scientists is not
the same as the interest of the parents.

790
01:06:29,736 --> 01:06:33,695
Scientists are human
and sometimes they can be wrong.

791
01:06:33,816 --> 01:06:39,049
As president of the foundation,
you represent us, the families.

792
01:06:39,176 --> 01:06:43,932
And you serve the families best
by informing them.

793
01:06:44,057 --> 01:06:49,211
And all we ask is that you please
send this letter to them, that's all.

794
01:06:49,337 --> 01:06:54,934
Our parents suffer enough without
being made the victims of false hopes.

795
01:06:55,057 --> 01:06:59,096
We can't give credence to every jerk
with a pocketful of apricot seeds.

796
01:06:59,217 --> 01:07:03,051
Excuse me, this is not Laetrile. We're
talking about an extract of olive oil,...

797
01:07:03,177 --> 01:07:06,453
an idea that was put forth
by the scientists at the symposium.

798
01:07:06,577 --> 01:07:08,534
And it works in Lorenzo.

799
01:07:08,658 --> 01:07:12,048
It works in an ALD boy
to a degree that is significant.

800
01:07:12,178 --> 01:07:16,854
Very significant.
-Other parents have a right to know.

801
01:07:17,378 --> 01:07:21,610
We know that this is a deadly disease,
so they have a right to choice.

802
01:07:21,738 --> 01:07:25,492
And if they feel as we do,
they can put pressure on the doctors.

803
01:07:25,618 --> 01:07:30,214
Because, as parents, we should
challenge these guys. We push them.

804
01:07:30,338 --> 01:07:37,017
Unless someone is willing to question,
to provoke, how would there be progress?

805
01:07:37,139 --> 01:07:39,016
Well, we feel there is progress.

806
01:07:39,139 --> 01:07:43,849
Loretta, we know that, but all we say is
start a dialectic with the doctors.

807
01:07:43,979 --> 01:07:45,776
Are you telling us what to do?

808
01:07:45,899 --> 01:07:48,129
We're asking you
to disseminate information.

809
01:07:48,259 --> 01:07:51,535
You gonna teach the doctors?
Where we come from, that's arrogance.

810
01:07:51,659 --> 01:07:53,889
Arrogance!
-Yes.

811
01:07:54,019 --> 01:07:56,169
It is... arrogance.

812
01:07:56,859 --> 01:08:01,217
It comes from the Latin word... arrogare.

813
01:08:01,340 --> 01:08:04,218
You know it? You know
the root? What it means?

814
01:08:04,340 --> 01:08:07,810
It means to claim for oneself.

815
01:08:07,940 --> 01:08:11,899
That's the root.
It means to claim for oneself.

816
01:08:13,060 --> 01:08:17,178
And I claim the right
to fight for my kid's life.

817
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:22,772
And no doctor, no researcher, no bloody
foundation, has the right to stop me...

818
01:08:22,900 --> 01:08:24,749
from asking questions
which might

819
01:08:24,750 --> 01:08:25,888
help me save him!

820
01:08:26,251 --> 01:08:30,403
And you have no right to stop
the sharing of information!

821
01:08:30,531 --> 01:08:33,648
So you think about it!
-Our job is to be there for the parents.

822
01:08:33,771 --> 01:08:36,080
To comfort them,
not to get them stirred up.

823
01:08:36,211 --> 01:08:40,204
If the doctors think you have something,
they will tell us in their own good time.

824
01:08:40,331 --> 01:08:44,210
Their own good time is not our time.
-What? They are so powerful...

825
01:08:44,331 --> 01:08:47,482
They are so powerful
that you would be silent?

826
01:08:47,611 --> 01:08:49,330
They are not gods!

827
01:08:49,452 --> 01:08:52,728
Do you know, this acquiescence
is so disgusting!

828
01:08:52,852 --> 01:08:55,286
You think you know so much.
Let me tell you something!

829
01:08:55,412 --> 01:08:58,927
When Michael got sick, we looked for
anything that might help him.

830
01:08:59,052 --> 01:09:01,805
And the best thing that happened?
He was taken quickly.

831
01:09:01,932 --> 01:09:05,447
Now, Tommy... he has lasted three years.

832
01:09:05,572 --> 01:09:08,370
For two of 'em, he's been
without his sight, his mind,...

833
01:09:08,492 --> 01:09:12,451
everything that makes him
a human being. He's a vegetable!

834
01:09:14,533 --> 01:09:19,243
Oh, boy! If you would stop all this
denial, you wouldn't do a thing...

835
01:09:19,373 --> 01:09:24,128
to prolong your boy's suffering
and indignity one minute longer.

836
01:09:32,173 --> 01:09:37,122
Has it occurred to you that maybe
he doesn't want to be around any more?

837
01:09:38,694 --> 01:09:40,650
Sì, s ì. Thank you.

838
01:09:40,774 --> 01:09:42,730
February 1985

839
01:09:48,134 --> 01:09:50,125
It has to be a mistake.

840
01:09:50,254 --> 01:09:53,246
No, Nikolais says not.

841
01:09:53,374 --> 01:09:55,524
Augusto...
-Oh, sorry.

842
01:09:57,894 --> 01:10:01,204
Should we risk raising the dose?
-No, he's too fragile.

843
01:10:01,334 --> 01:10:03,690
Any more might harm his liver.

844
01:10:27,655 --> 01:10:30,329
Lorenzo, listen to Mommy.

845
01:10:30,456 --> 01:10:33,289
You're going to have to be brave
as only you know how.

846
01:10:33,416 --> 01:10:35,884
We're gonna count together,
you and I, all right?

847
01:10:36,016 --> 01:10:39,326
Listen to Mommy's voice
and the boo-boo will let go of you.

848
01:10:39,456 --> 01:10:41,412
One, two,...

849
01:10:42,056 --> 01:10:44,172
three, four...

850
01:11:04,137 --> 01:11:06,093
Michaela...

851
01:11:07,697 --> 01:11:12,725
You know, I've been a nurse for 18 years,
eight of them spent in ICU paediatrics.

852
01:11:12,857 --> 01:11:16,816
And I know that you can't always
play by the rules, but...

853
01:11:16,937 --> 01:11:18,768
this boy shouldn't be at home.

854
01:11:18,897 --> 01:11:23,096
He should be placed
in a properly equipped hospital.

855
01:11:24,538 --> 01:11:26,733
Why don't you say what you mean?

856
01:11:26,858 --> 01:11:29,452
I'm not comfortable with this situation.

857
01:11:30,618 --> 01:11:35,373
Well, Lorenzo and I aren't comfortable
with your lack of comfort.

858
01:11:36,538 --> 01:11:39,291
I can't continue to be a party to this.

859
01:11:40,858 --> 01:11:43,292
I gotta give you my notice.
I'll stay until...

860
01:11:43,418 --> 01:11:46,138
No, you should finish tonight.
-Michaela! Go easy.

861
01:11:46,259 --> 01:11:49,968
Your agency will receive
a cheque in the morning.

862
01:11:50,099 --> 01:11:53,535
Look, Ruth. We're all
a little strung-out here.

863
01:11:53,659 --> 01:11:58,130
She's talking about placement, Deirdre.
It's a euphemism for "hospice".

864
01:11:58,259 --> 01:12:02,252
Lorenzo has enough to endure. We will
not expose ourself to doubt and despair.

865
01:12:02,379 --> 01:12:04,973
She's exhausted. That's all it is.

866
01:12:05,099 --> 01:12:09,092
Look, I don't know.
Somebody had to say something.

867
01:12:09,219 --> 01:12:11,176
Good luck.

868
01:12:20,220 --> 01:12:22,211
March 1985

869
01:13:04,182 --> 01:13:06,457
Buonasera, Odone.

870
01:13:06,582 --> 01:13:08,698
Look what I found.

871
01:13:08,822 --> 01:13:11,256
Look at this. Would you look at this!

872
01:13:13,142 --> 01:13:15,098
Let me show you.

873
01:13:16,022 --> 01:13:18,138
Where are we? Right here.

874
01:13:22,182 --> 01:13:25,619
That was June of '83, just 21 months ago.

875
01:13:32,343 --> 01:13:36,734
You know, it's time you guys
take it easy on yourselves.

876
01:13:36,863 --> 01:13:38,819
Deirdre...

877
01:13:40,143 --> 01:13:43,294
If we knew why it only work halfway,...

878
01:13:45,063 --> 01:13:48,260
then we might know what to do next.

879
01:13:48,383 --> 01:13:52,616
Augusto, how many mornings
have I found you asleep...

880
01:13:52,744 --> 01:13:56,134
under a pile of research papers
with the lights still on?

881
01:13:56,264 --> 01:13:59,574
And then you wake up
and drag yourself into the office.

882
01:13:59,704 --> 01:14:01,581
How long can you keep this up?

883
01:14:01,704 --> 01:14:04,821
If you get sick - and you will -
what are you gonna do for money?

884
01:14:04,944 --> 01:14:08,414
What are you telling me?
For God's sake, he is my kid.

885
01:14:08,544 --> 01:14:14,301
Yeah, so are Cristina and Francesco, and
it's been a year since you've seen them.

886
01:14:14,424 --> 01:14:16,381
Listen to me, OK?

887
01:14:18,585 --> 01:14:21,941
There has to be a life beyond Lorenzo.

888
01:14:23,065 --> 01:14:26,102
What are you telling me?
That I should give up on this now?

889
01:14:26,225 --> 01:14:29,774
Oh, man. We both know that even if
you get his levels down to normal,...

890
01:14:29,905 --> 01:14:31,896
his brain can't fix itself.

891
01:14:32,025 --> 01:14:35,540
How much myelin does he have left?
Do you ever ask yourself that?

892
01:14:35,665 --> 01:14:39,863
Deirdre, now that's enough.
-No. Don't bullshit me.

893
01:14:39,985 --> 01:14:43,342
I know you do... but she doesn't.

894
01:14:44,786 --> 01:14:46,742
Not ever.

895
01:14:47,906 --> 01:14:52,422
You have to help me with her.
She doesn't eat, she doesn't sleep.

896
01:14:53,466 --> 01:14:56,424
I'm afraid for her.
I think she's losing it.

897
01:14:58,026 --> 01:15:02,065
You've seen how she is with him.
She just can't let him go.

898
01:15:02,186 --> 01:15:04,142
Poor Deirdre.

899
01:15:04,866 --> 01:15:08,177
Spoken as only a woman who's
never had a child could speak.

900
01:15:08,307 --> 01:15:11,140
Michaela, Deirdre was
speaking out of love.

901
01:15:11,267 --> 01:15:13,622
I am only telling you what I see.

902
01:15:13,747 --> 01:15:17,581
For both your sakes,
there has to be life beyond Lorenzo.

903
01:15:17,707 --> 01:15:20,112
Do you think that
he has no voice?

904
01:15:20,113 --> 01:15:23,225
No will to live?
He asserts it through us!

905
01:15:23,347 --> 01:15:25,861
If you can't see that,
there's no place for you here!

906
01:15:25,987 --> 01:15:29,138
Michaela, for God's sake,
she is your sister!

907
01:15:29,267 --> 01:15:33,978
And I think you're losing it, Michaela.
-Well, then, I think you should go.

908
01:15:35,268 --> 01:15:38,305
Augusto, help her pack her bags.
I'm going back to our son.

909
01:15:38,428 --> 01:15:42,387
Your sister's right.
You're crazy. Absolutely crazy.

910
01:15:42,508 --> 01:15:44,863
You think I'm crazy
because I speak for our son?!

911
01:15:44,988 --> 01:15:47,456
Yes! Yes! Crazy!

912
01:15:47,588 --> 01:15:51,297
Insane. Demented.
Tainted in the head!

913
01:15:51,908 --> 01:15:57,461
Only a crazy woman would shun
her Church, her husband, her family.

914
01:15:57,589 --> 01:16:00,786
I am so sorry.
I never wanted this to happen.

915
01:16:00,909 --> 01:16:06,222
How can I? How can I enjoy
anything when he enjoys nothing?

916
01:16:06,349 --> 01:16:10,058
How can you talk to me about loving him
when you trivialise him into...

917
01:16:10,189 --> 01:16:13,704
You blame everybody
but yourself and your poisoned blood!

918
01:16:13,829 --> 01:16:15,785
No! No!

919
01:16:34,630 --> 01:16:36,905
Mrs Odone!
-Get a tube.

920
01:16:37,030 --> 01:16:38,622
Do you have the tube?

921
01:16:38,750 --> 01:16:41,469
Don't nod, Nancy Jo. Say "yes".
My attention's on Lorenzo.

922
01:16:41,590 --> 01:16:44,900
Darling, look at me. Listen to
Mommy's voice. We're gonna count.

923
01:16:45,030 --> 01:16:47,784
One, two, three, four...

924
01:17:05,071 --> 01:17:09,030
I'm sedating him as much as I dare.
I don't know what else to do.

925
01:17:19,192 --> 01:17:23,151
How can he endure this
for so many hours?

926
01:17:25,592 --> 01:17:27,548
Augusto...

927
01:17:28,472 --> 01:17:32,226
I don't think he'll have to
endure it much longer.

928
01:18:03,314 --> 01:18:06,545
Michaela, let me take him.

929
01:18:06,674 --> 01:18:08,949
You need rest.
-I'm fine.

930
01:18:09,714 --> 01:18:12,069
I could use a cup of coffee, though.

931
01:18:20,874 --> 01:18:23,308
Lorenzo... Lorenzo, listen to Mama.

932
01:18:24,234 --> 01:18:26,270
Can you hear me, my darling?

933
01:18:26,394 --> 01:18:28,989
If this is too much for you,
my sweetheart,...

934
01:18:29,115 --> 01:18:33,586
well then you fly, you fly
as fast as you can to baby Jesus.

935
01:18:36,355 --> 01:18:38,311
It's OK.

936
01:18:40,195 --> 01:18:42,345
Mama and Papa will be OK.

937
01:19:20,037 --> 01:19:23,586
I have rarely seen anything
like this boy's tenacity.

938
01:19:28,277 --> 01:19:30,666
They have a bed available upstairs.

939
01:19:30,797 --> 01:19:33,152
No, no, no. In a hospice, no.

940
01:19:34,037 --> 01:19:35,914
It'd be easier. On everybody.

941
01:19:36,037 --> 01:19:38,790
But I would not do honour to Lorenzo.

942
01:19:56,798 --> 01:19:58,834
Michaela. Come.

943
01:19:58,958 --> 01:20:01,347
What?
-Come. Come on.

944
01:20:01,478 --> 01:20:03,434
Nurse.
-Yes.

945
01:20:12,919 --> 01:20:16,673
Now, today we eat, moglie mia,
every last mouthful.

946
01:20:16,799 --> 01:20:18,915
I'm not hungry.
-No, no, no. You eat.

947
01:20:19,039 --> 01:20:20,028
Sit.

948
01:20:20,159 --> 01:20:23,151
Michaela, you sit. Sit.

949
01:20:23,279 --> 01:20:27,511
From tomorrow morning,
the Odones need all their energies.

950
01:20:27,639 --> 01:20:31,996
Now listen. We set out to
normalise Lorenzo's blood, right?

951
01:20:32,119 --> 01:20:37,877
And with the oleic oil, we got it
half-right, but that was luck.

952
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:42,755
It was rather more than luck.
-No, it was luck. Merely observation.

953
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:45,758
Rizzo observed something
in a test tube, right?

954
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:47,950
We tried it on Lorenzo.

955
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:51,356
Rizzo observed
a 50 percent drop in fibroblasts.

956
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:54,438
We observed
a 50 percent drop in Lorenzo.

957
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:59,874
Michaela, that is luck.
That is observation.

958
01:21:00,001 --> 01:21:04,119
That is all it is.
It is not understanding.

959
01:21:04,241 --> 01:21:07,551
And until we understand
why this work only halfway,...

960
01:21:07,681 --> 01:21:11,469
how can we expect
to succeed all the way?

961
01:21:11,601 --> 01:21:15,958
I need to understand, Michaela.
You need to understand.

962
01:21:16,961 --> 01:21:19,953
So, tomorrow we go back to the library.

963
01:21:20,681 --> 01:21:25,517
No, no, no. We review all the literature,
everything on fatty-acid metabolism,...

964
01:21:25,642 --> 01:21:28,076
every word published in the last decade.

965
01:21:28,202 --> 01:21:30,432
So, eat. You eat.

966
01:21:30,562 --> 01:21:33,759
Whatever energy or time I have left
I want to spend with Lorenzo.

967
01:21:33,882 --> 01:21:36,476
You will not have to leave him.
I will go to the library.

968
01:21:36,602 --> 01:21:38,877
I make copies for you,
I bring it home for you.

969
01:21:39,002 --> 01:21:42,597
Augusto, we are on our second mortgage.
You can't afford not to go to work.

970
01:21:42,722 --> 01:21:46,078
Michaela, I will work.
I'll fit it in somehow.

971
01:21:47,322 --> 01:21:51,077
Michaela, this is important. I need you.

972
01:21:53,603 --> 01:21:55,559
I need you, Michaela.

973
01:21:57,203 --> 01:21:58,875
So eat.

974
01:22:17,244 --> 01:22:20,475
Brava! Bravissima! Bravissima!

975
01:22:20,724 --> 01:22:23,682
April 1985
Twelve Months After Diagnosis

976
01:22:41,685 --> 01:22:43,641
Betty! Betty!

977
01:22:44,565 --> 01:22:48,638
All these fatty-acid studies concentrate
on the middle of the chain...

978
01:22:48,765 --> 01:22:52,440
because the medium-chain saturates
are implicated in cholesterol.

979
01:22:52,565 --> 01:22:55,955
So what do these researchers do?
Think cholesterol, cholesterol.

980
01:22:56,085 --> 01:22:59,077
C12. C14, C-bloody-16!

981
01:22:59,205 --> 01:23:02,402
Augusto, what are you looking for?
-I am looking...

982
01:23:02,525 --> 01:23:06,678
for the long end of fatty-acid chains!
-All right. Write it down for me.

983
01:23:06,806 --> 01:23:09,843
These researchers should be
doing something about this.

984
01:23:09,966 --> 01:23:12,196
Write it down.
-Long-chain fatty acids.

985
01:23:12,326 --> 01:23:15,921
C18 through C26.

986
01:23:16,566 --> 01:23:18,284
Saturated.

987
01:23:18,406 --> 01:23:20,715
Monounsaturated, OK?

988
01:23:20,846 --> 01:23:23,838
OK. Now I want you to go off to lunch.

989
01:23:23,966 --> 01:23:27,925
Have yourself a good lunch
and I'm gonna see what I can do.

990
01:23:38,087 --> 01:23:40,282
This is the best I could do
at short notice.

991
01:23:40,407 --> 01:23:43,843
One article from a veterinary
science journal about pigs.

992
01:23:43,967 --> 01:23:48,040
But it's on your long-chain fats.
-Well, thank you, Betty.

993
01:23:48,167 --> 01:23:51,045
Listen, I am very sorry about...

994
01:23:51,167 --> 01:23:53,920
Oh, well, you're Italian.

995
01:23:57,768 --> 01:24:02,125
72, 73, 74...

996
01:24:02,248 --> 01:24:06,287
That's it. 75, 76,...

997
01:24:07,128 --> 01:24:10,359
77, 78...

998
01:24:10,888 --> 01:24:13,038
Nice going, Mrs Odone.

999
01:24:14,088 --> 01:24:17,967
That's it, my love. You know
only the strongest, bravest boy,...

1000
01:24:18,088 --> 01:24:21,684
only a very special person
like you is chosen to fight the boo-boo.

1001
01:24:21,809 --> 01:24:24,277
I'll give him a little water, OK? 20cc's?

1002
01:24:24,409 --> 01:24:25,444
Yes.

1003
01:24:25,569 --> 01:24:30,484
And, Nancy Jo, why don't you tell Lorenzo
what an excellent job he did?

1004
01:24:30,609 --> 01:24:32,884
An excellent job you did, Lorenzo.

1005
01:24:33,009 --> 01:24:38,163
Sometimes I wonder, my love, if people
realise how incredible you truly are.

1006
01:24:40,689 --> 01:24:42,645
May 1985

1007
01:24:47,450 --> 01:24:49,884
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.

1008
01:24:51,330 --> 01:24:53,605
Is this a new hobby or a nervous tic?

1009
01:24:56,210 --> 01:24:59,441
No, this is a simple mind at work,
that's all.

1010
01:24:59,570 --> 01:25:03,768
See, each paperclip, Deirdre,
is two carbon atom, right?

1011
01:25:03,890 --> 01:25:05,528
Oh, God!
-No, no, no.

1012
01:25:05,650 --> 01:25:07,925
Really is two carbon atom, all right?

1013
01:25:08,050 --> 01:25:11,680
So we have C2, C4, C6, you know?

1014
01:25:11,811 --> 01:25:14,723
Now, here's what I try to do.
I try to make a chain,...

1015
01:25:14,851 --> 01:25:18,605
a very long chain
of monounsaturated fats.

1016
01:25:18,731 --> 01:25:22,201
This is the good guys, right?
-OK, what are these? The bad guys?

1017
01:25:22,331 --> 01:25:24,765
Yes. These here...

1018
01:25:24,891 --> 01:25:27,405
is the bad guys, all right?

1019
01:25:27,531 --> 01:25:29,567
Now, Deirdre, what I'm trying to do...

1020
01:25:29,691 --> 01:25:32,000
I try to understand the relationship...

1021
01:25:32,131 --> 01:25:35,089
between the good guys
and the bad guys.

1022
01:25:35,451 --> 01:25:38,250
So, OK, I am the enzyme, right?

1023
01:25:38,372 --> 01:25:43,571
And I reach out and grab a carbon atom
and I put it on my chain, right?

1024
01:25:43,692 --> 01:25:45,125
Here is my chain.

1025
01:25:45,252 --> 01:25:47,891
Now, here, you be
the bad-guy enzyme, OK?

1026
01:25:48,012 --> 01:25:51,607
No, no. Do this for me.
You be bad-guy enzyme, all right?

1027
01:25:51,732 --> 01:25:53,165
Take this, all right?

1028
01:25:53,292 --> 01:25:58,286
Now you reach out and grab a carbon
atom and put it on your bad-guy chain.

1029
01:25:58,412 --> 01:26:00,767
I had enough trouble
with the kitchen sink.

1030
01:26:00,892 --> 01:26:05,489
No, no. You just do this and
then I explain, OK? All right.

1031
01:26:05,613 --> 01:26:11,085
So let's each start now
making our chains.

1032
01:26:11,213 --> 01:26:15,570
OK? All right? Do another one.
That's good, Deirdre.

1033
01:26:15,693 --> 01:26:17,729
Good. We put another one on...

1034
01:26:17,853 --> 01:26:21,528
Here's the stuff on enzyme complexes.
-Ah, thank you. Mille grazie.

1035
01:26:21,653 --> 01:26:23,484
Prego.
-Prego! Very good.

1036
01:26:23,613 --> 01:26:25,968
Now, did you make the extra copies?
-Oh, you bet.

1037
01:26:26,093 --> 01:26:28,449
Thank you very much.
-For Michaela? How is she?

1038
01:26:28,574 --> 01:26:29,973
She's fine.

1039
01:26:30,094 --> 01:26:34,531
So here we are. We're making our chains
more or less the same rate, right?

1040
01:26:34,654 --> 01:26:36,770
That's as one would expect, right?

1041
01:26:36,894 --> 01:26:40,045
But, now, Deirdre, if we were enzymes...

1042
01:26:40,174 --> 01:26:43,644
in the bodies of little rats
and little pigs and Lorenzo,...

1043
01:26:43,774 --> 01:26:47,528
then the faster I go,
the more you slow down.

1044
01:26:48,334 --> 01:26:50,609
Now, why would that be?

1045
01:26:50,734 --> 01:26:56,287
Why, the faster I go, would you slow
down, if we are both separate enzymes?

1046
01:26:56,415 --> 01:27:01,091
It means that there has to be
some kind of relationship going on.

1047
01:27:01,215 --> 01:27:05,447
We affect each other some way.
There's some kind of interplay.

1048
01:27:05,575 --> 01:27:08,089
But what is it?

1049
01:27:08,215 --> 01:27:10,171
What is it?

1050
01:27:11,495 --> 01:27:13,247
May 29th 1985

1051
01:27:13,535 --> 01:27:15,491
One, two,...

1052
01:27:16,215 --> 01:27:18,525
three, four,...

1053
01:27:19,376 --> 01:27:21,970
five, six,...

1054
01:27:22,496 --> 01:27:24,088
seven candles.

1055
01:27:24,216 --> 01:27:26,935
And Mommy will blow them out for you.

1056
01:27:27,056 --> 01:27:29,012
Make a wish.

1057
01:28:07,858 --> 01:28:10,577
Michaela! They are the same enzyme!

1058
01:28:10,698 --> 01:28:15,613
There is one enzyme for both chains.
It's the same bloody enzyme!

1059
01:28:15,738 --> 01:28:19,174
So if we keep the enzyme busy
making monounsaturates...

1060
01:28:19,298 --> 01:28:21,766
It distracts it from
elongating the saturates.

1061
01:28:21,898 --> 01:28:24,458
Right! So we have a way to trick nature.

1062
01:28:24,578 --> 01:28:27,570
Yes, it's a principle called
"competitive inhibition".

1063
01:28:27,698 --> 01:28:30,815
So, Gus, do you think
it's a reasonable hypothesis?

1064
01:28:30,938 --> 01:28:35,171
I think it's more. You've clarified
the biochemical pathway.

1065
01:28:35,299 --> 01:28:37,972
Augusto, I really want
to congratulate you.

1066
01:28:38,099 --> 01:28:42,331
This would explain why oleic acid
is only partly successful.

1067
01:28:42,459 --> 01:28:46,134
Yes, it's C18, you see.
It's too low down in the chain.

1068
01:28:46,259 --> 01:28:50,491
So we add a second barrier. We block
the bad guys further up the chain,...

1069
01:28:50,619 --> 01:28:54,737
the saturates further up the chain,
between C22 and C24.

1070
01:28:54,859 --> 01:28:57,009
There we stop
the bloody things completely.

1071
01:28:57,139 --> 01:29:00,769
And how would you do that?
-By adding monounsaturated C22.

1072
01:29:00,900 --> 01:29:03,573
That's erucic acid.
-Yes, exactly.

1073
01:29:04,220 --> 01:29:06,211
Erm...

1074
01:29:06,340 --> 01:29:08,092
Martha?
-Yes, Doctor?

1075
01:29:08,220 --> 01:29:13,248
Among our animal studies,
you will find a file on erucic acid.

1076
01:29:13,380 --> 01:29:16,099
With an e... r-u-c-i-c.

1077
01:29:16,220 --> 01:29:18,176
OK.
-Thank you.

1078
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:21,534
You don't believe it will work?

1079
01:29:21,660 --> 01:29:26,815
I think what you have done is postulate a
theory that could be of enormous benefit.

1080
01:29:26,941 --> 01:29:31,332
But, as for erucic acid,
it creates cardiac problems in rats.

1081
01:29:32,101 --> 01:29:35,776
If it's not safe for rats, I don't know
what justification there can be...

1082
01:29:35,901 --> 01:29:39,735
for using it as a therapy on humans.

1083
01:29:39,861 --> 01:29:41,613
But Gus, Gus,...

1084
01:29:41,741 --> 01:29:45,529
erucic acid is the chief component
in rapeseed oil, right?

1085
01:29:45,661 --> 01:29:49,052
Rapeseed oil is a common food
in China and India.

1086
01:29:49,182 --> 01:29:52,060
And their rate of heart disease
is far lower than here.

1087
01:29:52,182 --> 01:29:55,811
All right, look at these documents.
Cardiac lipidosis,...

1088
01:29:55,942 --> 01:30:00,060
myocardial lesions, cholesterol
deposits in the adrenal gland...

1089
01:30:00,182 --> 01:30:03,060
and damage to the reproductive system.

1090
01:30:03,182 --> 01:30:06,777
I'm afraid the weight of evidence
is much too great.

1091
01:30:06,902 --> 01:30:09,370
And no human-studies
review committee...

1092
01:30:09,502 --> 01:30:13,575
will ever do anything but discard
erucic acid out of hand.

1093
01:30:13,702 --> 01:30:17,935
But the human studies
have been accomplished by history.

1094
01:30:18,063 --> 01:30:22,375
They have been eating the stuff in
these countries for thousands of years.

1095
01:30:22,503 --> 01:30:26,257
You can't expect me to start a protocol
based on that kind of assertion.

1096
01:30:26,383 --> 01:30:28,533
You should examine your protocol...

1097
01:30:28,663 --> 01:30:32,212
when children are dying and
find a way to research these...

1098
01:30:32,343 --> 01:30:36,131
It's common sense.
-We simply have a contradiction.

1099
01:30:36,263 --> 01:30:40,052
We seek more information. We do not
dismiss erucic acid out of hand.

1100
01:30:40,184 --> 01:30:44,462
Michaela, if I ignore
all this evidence...

1101
01:30:44,584 --> 01:30:48,259
and we embark on a therapy
based on erucic acid...

1102
01:30:49,944 --> 01:30:52,822
Something goes wrong. What then?

1103
01:30:53,384 --> 01:30:57,741
Well, then I suppose the risk-reward
ratio is too unattractive for you.

1104
01:30:58,384 --> 01:31:00,340
I beg your pardon?

1105
01:31:01,464 --> 01:31:04,821
The life of one boy
is not enough reward for you...

1106
01:31:04,945 --> 01:31:09,973
to risk the reputation of the institution
and the esteem of your peers.

1107
01:31:11,385 --> 01:31:13,126
That was uncalled for.

1108
01:31:14,327 --> 01:31:16,978
Your responsibility is
merely towards your own child.

1109
01:31:17,105 --> 01:31:21,940
My responsibility is towards all the boys
that suffer from this disease,...

1110
01:31:22,065 --> 01:31:24,135
now and in the future.

1111
01:31:25,145 --> 01:31:28,581
Of course I anguish for
the suffering of your boy.

1112
01:31:29,385 --> 01:31:33,823
And of course I applaud you for
the efforts you make on his behalf.

1113
01:31:34,666 --> 01:31:37,624
But I will have nothing to do
with this oil.

1114
01:31:38,786 --> 01:31:43,701
We are not asking, Doctor,
for your anguish or your applause.

1115
01:31:43,826 --> 01:31:46,784
We are asking merely
for a little courage.

1116
01:31:51,746 --> 01:31:53,702
OK. All right.

1117
01:31:58,427 --> 01:32:03,899
No, whatever the doctors say, reason
tells us it is a risk worth taking.

1118
01:32:04,027 --> 01:32:08,100
But, my friend, we need
a sympathetic collaborator, hm?

1119
01:32:08,227 --> 01:32:11,583
If it was in my hands, I would do
anything I could to help, Mr Odone.

1120
01:32:11,707 --> 01:32:13,663
I have a boy of my own.

1121
01:32:14,507 --> 01:32:16,418
But I don't like our chances.

1122
01:32:16,547 --> 01:32:21,258
You know, they said the same thing
about the oleic acid, and here it was,...

1123
01:32:21,388 --> 01:32:24,983
sitting right on the shelf.
-This is a whole other ball game.

1124
01:32:25,108 --> 01:32:29,067
Extracting the saturated C24 and 26
from rapeseed oil...

1125
01:32:29,188 --> 01:32:32,305
It's very tricky. It would take
our best chemist at least a year.

1126
01:32:32,428 --> 01:32:37,866
And then you would never get it past the
FDA. Erucic acid for human consumption?

1127
01:32:37,988 --> 01:32:42,027
I'm sorry, but no one in the country
is gonna touch it.

1128
01:32:42,148 --> 01:32:45,380
Well, what about
outside this country, hm?

1129
01:32:45,509 --> 01:32:47,545
Uh, I wouldn't know where to send you.

1130
01:32:47,669 --> 01:32:52,379
Oh, Mr Pellerman! We're agents
for over a dozen foreign companies.

1131
01:32:52,509 --> 01:32:54,386
There must be one that could help.

1132
01:32:54,509 --> 01:32:57,660
Maybe all we need to do is look
at the list of the foreign companies.

1133
01:32:57,789 --> 01:33:00,701
No, you and your wife
have enough to do.

1134
01:33:00,829 --> 01:33:05,380
I'm sure Mr Pellerman would be happy
to make the calls for you.

1135
01:33:09,309 --> 01:33:11,028
We'd have to be covered, legally.

1136
01:33:11,150 --> 01:33:15,382
If anything goes wrong, this company
is not going to be held liable.

1137
01:33:15,510 --> 01:33:18,582
Oh, we would not hold you liable. No, no.

1138
01:33:18,710 --> 01:33:24,467
And this... It would be greatly
appreciated if we could circulate this.

1139
01:33:28,950 --> 01:33:33,705
"The interplay of monounsaturated
and saturated fatty acids:

1140
01:33:33,830 --> 01:33:36,868
therapeutic application in ALD."

1141
01:33:36,991 --> 01:33:38,470
Wow.
-You wrote this?

1142
01:33:38,591 --> 01:33:42,106
Yes. We felt that
if we were asking for help,...

1143
01:33:42,231 --> 01:33:45,428
our rationale needs to be very clear.

1144
01:33:45,551 --> 01:33:50,944
We've all read your paper.
It's a beautiful piece of biochemistry.

1145
01:33:51,071 --> 01:33:54,188
Over a hundred companies
all say "too difficult".

1146
01:33:54,311 --> 01:33:57,747
Well, my first impression
was that it's bloody impossible.

1147
01:33:57,871 --> 01:34:01,547
But I've been doing difficult
fractionations for 40 years...

1148
01:34:01,672 --> 01:34:05,267
and I'd like to have a stab at it.
-How long do you think, Mr Suddaby?

1149
01:34:05,392 --> 01:34:09,101
I've only six months
before I retire, so we'll see.

1150
01:34:09,232 --> 01:34:14,181
All right. Then I'll let you get on with
it. Call me if you have any questions.

1151
01:34:14,312 --> 01:34:16,268
Righto. Bye, then.

1152
01:34:25,792 --> 01:34:27,749
CRODA CHEMICALS
London

1153
01:34:27,873 --> 01:34:32,822
September 1985
Seventeen Months After Diagnosis

1154
01:34:37,713 --> 01:34:39,669
Who could this be?

1155
01:34:43,273 --> 01:34:45,503
Ah, your good friend Wendy...

1156
01:34:45,633 --> 01:34:49,308
with all sorts of lovely
vegetables and fruits.

1157
01:34:49,993 --> 01:34:51,950
Hi, Michaela.
-Look what you brought us!

1158
01:34:52,074 --> 01:34:53,905
Hi, Lorenzo.

1159
01:34:54,034 --> 01:34:55,945
Jake's not in school today?

1160
01:34:56,074 --> 01:34:58,030
He's not feeling so good.

1161
01:35:00,354 --> 01:35:04,586
I'm going for a walk with Mrs Gimble
and we shall be back shortly.

1162
01:35:04,714 --> 01:35:07,990
I've given him his oxcarbazepine
and 15ml of water.

1163
01:35:08,834 --> 01:35:12,668
Do you want me to do anything else?
-I'm sure he would love a story.

1164
01:35:12,794 --> 01:35:15,149
Do you have a problem with this?

1165
01:35:17,435 --> 01:35:19,391
Fine.

1166
01:35:25,515 --> 01:35:29,144
He's had a couple of tantrums.
-Oh, I'm sorry.

1167
01:35:29,275 --> 01:35:31,231
It's OK.

1168
01:35:32,075 --> 01:35:36,034
Dr Rizzo got him in the oleic acid trial.
-That's good.

1169
01:35:41,195 --> 01:35:43,152
Hi, Jake.

1170
01:35:44,596 --> 01:35:47,633
Hi, sweetie.
Thank you for my potatoes.

1171
01:35:49,916 --> 01:35:51,872
Say hello, son.

1172
01:35:54,556 --> 01:35:56,911
Hi, Mrs...

1173
01:35:57,036 --> 01:35:59,994
Odone.

1174
01:36:09,037 --> 01:36:11,995
He saw the way Jaybird went.

1175
01:36:12,837 --> 01:36:15,192
He knows what's in store for him.

1176
01:36:21,077 --> 01:36:23,796
"They forgot their hunger
and followed the bird."

1177
01:36:23,917 --> 01:36:25,873
"They came to an opening in the forest."

1178
01:36:25,997 --> 01:36:30,195
"Before them was a little cottage,
gleaming in the rays of the setting sun."

1179
01:36:30,317 --> 01:36:34,106
"'Look, Gretel' exclaimed Hansel.
'That cottage is made of gingerbread."'

1180
01:36:34,238 --> 01:36:37,469
"'It really is' replied Gretel,
running up and tasting a bit...

1181
01:36:37,598 --> 01:36:39,475
that she had pulled from the wall."

1182
01:36:39,598 --> 01:36:42,032
"'And the roof is shingled
with butterscotch."'

1183
01:36:42,158 --> 01:36:46,071
"'The windowsills are made of chocolate'
declared Hansel, breaking off a bit."

1184
01:36:46,198 --> 01:36:49,668
"'The windowpanes are clear candy'
said Gretel. At that moment"

1185
01:36:49,798 --> 01:36:53,268
Nancy Jo, do you think you could muster
just a tad more enthusiasm?

1186
01:36:53,398 --> 01:36:56,231
Lorenzo loves words.
He loves the sound of language.

1187
01:36:56,358 --> 01:36:59,635
Well, I'm paid to nurse,
not read stories.

1188
01:37:00,479 --> 01:37:03,835
You've decided his mind doesn't need
as much nurturing as his body?

1189
01:37:03,959 --> 01:37:05,915
What mind?

1190
01:37:06,479 --> 01:37:08,435
I beg your pardon!

1191
01:37:09,639 --> 01:37:11,914
Nothing.

1192
01:37:12,039 --> 01:37:14,030
Get out.

1193
01:37:14,159 --> 01:37:16,627
Look, Mrs Odone...
-Just get out.

1194
01:37:16,759 --> 01:37:20,035
I've read up on this disease!
I know what it's done to his brain!

1195
01:37:20,159 --> 01:37:23,755
Lorenzo doesn't need this from
a subliterate with a double-digit IQ!

1196
01:37:23,880 --> 01:37:26,269
Face it. The lights are out
and nobody's home!

1197
01:37:26,400 --> 01:37:28,789
Just get out. Go!
-Well, merry Christmas.

1198
01:37:28,920 --> 01:37:31,070
Get out!
-Happy holidays!

1199
01:37:31,880 --> 01:37:33,836
And a joyous yuletide!

1200
01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:43,829
"Near a great forest
lived a poor woodcutter...

1201
01:37:43,960 --> 01:37:46,997
with his two children,
Hansel and Gretel."

1202
01:37:47,120 --> 01:37:50,431
"Times were very hard and
a day came when there was no food,...

1203
01:37:50,561 --> 01:37:52,597
except a little stale bread."

1204
01:37:52,721 --> 01:37:56,077
"But Hansel" was like you, my darling.

1205
01:37:57,321 --> 01:38:02,873
"He was a clever lad who knew
how to solve difficult problems."

1206
01:38:04,561 --> 01:38:07,121
"The woodcutter was very sad"

1207
01:38:08,041 --> 01:38:10,555
Are you going to
keep doing this?

1208
01:38:10,681 --> 01:38:14,721
She brought it on herself. She
consigned herself to the outer darkness.

1209
01:38:14,842 --> 01:38:19,233
Michaela, Nancy Jo, she was
a good nurse. You train her well.

1210
01:38:19,362 --> 01:38:22,240
Yes, but I want someone
to give him more than medication.

1211
01:38:22,362 --> 01:38:25,798
Someone who will minister
to his mind and his soul.

1212
01:38:26,722 --> 01:38:28,872
I think I've found him.
-What?

1213
01:38:30,122 --> 01:38:33,194
I wrote to Omouri.
I asked him to come and stay with us.

1214
01:38:33,322 --> 01:38:34,277
Omouri?
-Yes.

1215
01:38:34,402 --> 01:38:38,362
Lorenzo is surrounded by women all day.
I don't want him to grow up hag-ridden.

1216
01:38:38,483 --> 01:38:41,475
But you cannot take a boy
out of his fishing village...

1217
01:38:41,603 --> 01:38:43,594
and bring him here to nurse Lorenzo.

1218
01:38:43,723 --> 01:38:47,272
Not to nurse him, to be his friend.
To bring the Comoros into this room.

1219
01:38:47,403 --> 01:38:53,399
We cannot uproot this young man
from his family, his way of life.

1220
01:38:54,443 --> 01:38:57,355
Where will he live?
-Here, in Lorenzo's room.

1221
01:38:57,483 --> 01:39:00,441
But... he has no English.

1222
01:39:01,283 --> 01:39:04,196
He's a Muslim. An African.

1223
01:39:04,324 --> 01:39:09,557
We cannot bring an African to this racist
country to be a second-class citizen.

1224
01:39:09,684 --> 01:39:12,517
This is Washington, DC.
-He'll be part of this family.

1225
01:39:12,644 --> 01:39:15,363
I'll teach him English.
There's a lot we can do for him.

1226
01:39:15,484 --> 01:39:17,440
Oh, Michaela...

1227
01:39:18,004 --> 01:39:19,960
Here. Sit down, sit down.

1228
01:39:21,524 --> 01:39:26,040
Now, the last time
Omouri saw Lorenzo,...

1229
01:39:26,164 --> 01:39:28,120
he was climbing trees.

1230
01:39:28,244 --> 01:39:31,681
He was a wild and vibrant boy,
full of life.

1231
01:39:35,125 --> 01:39:37,878
In the letter that
you wrote to Omouri,...

1232
01:39:39,005 --> 01:39:43,760
did you tell him what he will see
when he walks into this room?

1233
01:39:45,165 --> 01:39:50,000
I told him he'd see a young man who
was very ill and had need of a friend.

1234
01:39:50,765 --> 01:39:52,323
That is all?

1235
01:39:52,445 --> 01:39:55,961
How would you have me describe him?
As a biochemical conundrum?

1236
01:39:56,086 --> 01:39:58,042
Non è vero.

1237
01:39:58,886 --> 01:40:01,844
You know he is not that for me.

1238
01:40:03,406 --> 01:40:06,955
Augusto, when you look at him,
what do you see?

1239
01:40:09,486 --> 01:40:11,841
Tell me the truth.

1240
01:40:24,007 --> 01:40:26,601
It's very difficult...

1241
01:40:26,727 --> 01:40:29,161
to know for sure...

1242
01:40:30,167 --> 01:40:34,126
what is left of our Lorenzo.

1243
01:40:35,247 --> 01:40:39,798
If a person cannot move,...

1244
01:40:40,407 --> 01:40:42,363
cannot see,...

1245
01:40:43,247 --> 01:40:45,204
cannot speak,...

1246
01:40:46,168 --> 01:40:50,923
how can we know what is in the soul?

1247
01:40:55,928 --> 01:40:57,884
He is my little boy.

1248
01:40:59,008 --> 01:41:01,442
And my only wish...

1249
01:41:02,848 --> 01:41:06,807
is to have him back as he was before.

1250
01:41:14,729 --> 01:41:18,085
March 1986
Twenty-three Months After Diagnosis

1251
01:41:41,970 --> 01:41:45,121
How do I tell the man to give up?
-Say his health won't take it.

1252
01:41:45,250 --> 01:41:48,959
The hours he's working are daft.
Our expectations were unrealistic.

1253
01:41:49,090 --> 01:41:53,402
Look, Don's a man who's been working all
of his life in face creams and cosmetics.

1254
01:41:53,530 --> 01:41:56,920
With this oil, he's having the time
of his life. You tell him. I won't.

1255
01:41:57,050 --> 01:41:59,325
All right. For his own sake,
I'll have to.

1256
01:41:59,450 --> 01:42:03,888
Then you can call Mrs Odone and
tell her that you've pulled the plug.

1257
01:42:06,491 --> 01:42:09,642
I'd best leave him be.
-I think you're right.

1258
01:42:21,091 --> 01:42:23,047
Omouri!

1259
01:43:07,653 --> 01:43:10,804
Lorenzo... Omouri is here.

1260
01:44:14,816 --> 01:44:17,967
Morning.
-Good morning, Mr Suddaby.

1261
01:44:18,096 --> 01:44:22,055
There's a bottle of pure erucic acid
triglyceride on my bench.

1262
01:44:22,176 --> 01:44:26,055
Will you see that it gets to young
Mr Odone as soon as possible, please?

1263
01:44:26,696 --> 01:44:28,652
I'm off home now. Bye-bye.

1264
01:44:29,576 --> 01:44:31,215
Goodbye, Mr Suddaby.

1265
01:44:34,937 --> 01:44:37,531
Well, we'd better get on with it.

1266
01:44:38,657 --> 01:44:40,613
September 1986

1267
01:44:45,857 --> 01:44:49,213
Four parts our old friend, the oleic.

1268
01:44:50,617 --> 01:44:52,573
And...

1269
01:44:53,137 --> 01:44:56,174
one part erucic.

1270
01:44:57,858 --> 01:45:01,407
And the journey begins,
and like all good journeys,...

1271
01:45:01,538 --> 01:45:04,098
with food.

1272
01:45:06,538 --> 01:45:08,688
Where's the wretched nurse?

1273
01:45:08,818 --> 01:45:12,527
I'm gonna take my baseline myself
if she doesn't get here soon.

1274
01:45:12,658 --> 01:45:16,287
A month is much too long.
If we check my blood every week...

1275
01:45:16,418 --> 01:45:21,652
and I have a cardiogram, we should
know enough to start Lorenzo sooner.

1276
01:45:21,779 --> 01:45:23,929
Oh, at last!

1277
01:45:32,019 --> 01:45:33,737
Hi.

1278
01:45:33,859 --> 01:45:35,577
How's the mother tiger?

1279
01:45:37,099 --> 01:45:40,887
Augusto didn't tell you?
I'm here to be Lorenzo's rat.

1280
01:45:43,059 --> 01:45:45,619
That's a very kind offer,
but I can't let you.

1281
01:45:45,739 --> 01:45:49,528
I'm a carrier, just like you. My blood
levels are just as high as yours.

1282
01:45:49,660 --> 01:45:53,414
I've had my baseline taken...
and I'm starving.

1283
01:45:54,980 --> 01:45:58,575
Oh, I have been wanting
to meet Lorenzo's main man.

1284
01:45:59,780 --> 01:46:02,055
I am content
to greet Aunt Deirdre.

1285
01:46:02,180 --> 01:46:04,694
Well, it's good to meet you too.

1286
01:46:04,820 --> 01:46:09,291
Now, now, Michaela. I want no argument.
Michaela, you cannot test it.

1287
01:46:09,420 --> 01:46:13,414
Lorenzo needs you fit and well.p
-So you would put Deirdre at risk...

1288
01:46:13,541 --> 01:46:17,819
without even discussing...
-Hey! I backpacked all through India.

1289
01:46:17,941 --> 01:46:20,853
I must have eaten
rapeseed oil up the wazoo.

1290
01:46:20,981 --> 01:46:24,337
Ah, I've been fasting all day.
-All right, go ahead. Try it.

1291
01:46:24,461 --> 01:46:26,417
OK, here goes.

1292
01:46:30,101 --> 01:46:32,376
So... does it taste awful?

1293
01:46:33,221 --> 01:46:35,291
No? Good.
-It's good.

1294
01:46:35,421 --> 01:46:37,731
Good. Eat, eat.

1295
01:46:42,222 --> 01:46:44,497
Your sister
had no side effects?

1296
01:46:44,622 --> 01:46:46,375
None at all. If we can
normalise the levels

1297
01:46:46,376 --> 01:46:48,900
of a carrier so quickly,
who knows?

1298
01:46:49,022 --> 01:46:51,934
We'll start Lorenzo immediately.
-Marvellous.

1299
01:46:52,062 --> 01:46:53,973
We're all terribly grateful.
-No, no.

1300
01:46:54,102 --> 01:46:58,653
Not to mention Deedee, the family rat.

1301
01:46:58,782 --> 01:47:02,458
What dosage will you give the lad?
-We don't have time to be conservative.

1302
01:47:02,583 --> 01:47:04,892
We've decided on eight grams.

1303
01:47:37,984 --> 01:47:39,940
September 27th 1986

1304
01:48:12,225 --> 01:48:13,863
Hello.
-Mr Odone?

1305
01:48:13,985 --> 01:48:15,338
Odo-ne, yes.

1306
01:48:15,465 --> 01:48:18,856
Look, we have a problem
with this blood sample.

1307
01:48:18,986 --> 01:48:21,819
You have a problem?
What is the problem?

1308
01:48:21,946 --> 01:48:25,302
Could there have been
a mistake in the labelling?

1309
01:48:25,426 --> 01:48:28,065
No. No mistake. Why?

1310
01:48:28,186 --> 01:48:33,738
Well, we ran the assay twice and
the levels of C24 and C26 read normal.

1311
01:48:39,706 --> 01:48:41,662
They read normal?

1312
01:48:42,626 --> 01:48:45,585
Well, uh, I...

1313
01:48:46,787 --> 01:48:48,903
Do you have the sample in front of you?

1314
01:48:49,027 --> 01:48:50,585
Yes.

1315
01:48:50,707 --> 01:48:54,495
What is the name on the sample?
-Lorenzo Michael Murphy Odone.

1316
01:48:54,627 --> 01:48:56,583
It's Odo-ne.

1317
01:48:57,307 --> 01:48:59,457
No, there's no mistake.

1318
01:49:00,427 --> 01:49:03,180
But thank you very much.
-OK, bye.

1319
01:49:18,828 --> 01:49:22,787
December 8th 1986
Thirty-two Months After Diagnosis

1320
01:49:27,748 --> 01:49:30,023
What's going on?
-His levels are normal.

1321
01:49:30,148 --> 01:49:32,708
Play! Play!
-Oh, that's wonderful!

1322
01:49:36,029 --> 01:49:38,543
Now, drink it up, son.

1323
01:49:38,669 --> 01:49:40,864
Every last drop. Good.

1324
01:49:42,429 --> 01:49:46,581
Mom says this is
the only bottle in the world.

1325
01:49:48,229 --> 01:49:51,027
Now that we have destroyed
Lorenzo's blood fats,...

1326
01:49:51,149 --> 01:49:55,108
I'm sure that Mr Suddaby
will make us plenty more, huh?

1327
01:49:55,949 --> 01:49:59,499
Mom says this is bootleg.

1328
01:50:01,070 --> 01:50:03,459
I know this is only
a fraction of what it cost...

1329
01:50:03,590 --> 01:50:06,150
-No, no, no, Wendy.
-You gotta take it.

1330
01:50:06,270 --> 01:50:09,421
No, we work on the barter system.

1331
01:50:09,550 --> 01:50:12,018
Our oil, your produce, huh?

1332
01:50:12,150 --> 01:50:15,381
There aren't that many
potatoes in the world.

1333
01:50:15,510 --> 01:50:17,466
OK. Here you go.

1334
01:50:19,070 --> 01:50:20,788
So, when will you tell Nikolais?

1335
01:50:20,910 --> 01:50:24,586
Well, we told him and the other doctors
and we sent all the figures.

1336
01:50:24,711 --> 01:50:28,784
What did they have to say?
-They deliberate. They want more study.

1337
01:50:28,911 --> 01:50:32,108
Wendy, that's enough.
-So the other kids have to wait?

1338
01:50:32,231 --> 01:50:34,347
We know what to do
about that, don't we?

1339
01:50:34,471 --> 01:50:37,543
The doctors had a very hard time
swallowing the first oil.

1340
01:50:37,671 --> 01:50:40,981
They want to see how it goes
with Lorenzo on the second.

1341
01:50:41,111 --> 01:50:43,386
But we don't have time, do we?
-No.

1342
01:50:43,511 --> 01:50:46,662
So we leave science
to its own concerns, huh?

1343
01:50:48,311 --> 01:50:50,667
Merry Christmas.
-Goodbye, Jake.

1344
01:51:24,153 --> 01:51:26,792
What happened to the suction machine?

1345
01:51:26,913 --> 01:51:30,701
There's no need, Michaela.
Not for four hours.

1346
01:51:30,833 --> 01:51:32,664
I turned the machine off.

1347
01:51:35,353 --> 01:51:38,026
All last night he made
to swallow for himself.

1348
01:51:39,073 --> 01:51:41,713
Augusto! Augusto!

1349
01:51:46,434 --> 01:51:48,390
February 1987

1350
01:51:51,594 --> 01:51:54,267
We hope to make
an announcement quite soon...

1351
01:51:54,394 --> 01:51:58,069
about a new development
in our diet therapy.

1352
01:51:58,194 --> 01:52:01,186
It's expensive but,
with the help of the government...

1353
01:52:01,314 --> 01:52:03,874
and of this wonderful foundation,...

1354
01:52:03,994 --> 01:52:08,352
we are going to start a trial
before the end of the year.

1355
01:52:09,075 --> 01:52:11,635
Six Months Later

1356
01:52:17,075 --> 01:52:20,431
I can hear from that
that you wish us Godspeed.

1357
01:52:31,316 --> 01:52:32,988
Excuse me, Doctor!

1358
01:52:33,116 --> 01:52:36,347
Are you referring to the oil
the Odones have invented for Lorenzo?

1359
01:52:36,476 --> 01:52:39,388
We'll take questions later.
-No, it's a good question.

1360
01:52:39,516 --> 01:52:43,748
I should have mentioned it perhaps but...
The Odones have been extremely active...

1361
01:52:43,876 --> 01:52:45,787
and we are in their debt.

1362
01:52:45,916 --> 01:52:48,476
Thanks to them,
we are preparing a protocol...

1363
01:52:48,596 --> 01:52:51,668
for review by
the human-studies committee.

1364
01:52:51,796 --> 01:52:54,913
If then we can persuade
the government to fund us,...

1365
01:52:55,036 --> 01:53:00,509
then we shall know if this oil is of
more than temporary therapeutic value.

1366
01:53:00,637 --> 01:53:03,788
But it works! Lorenzo's
blood levels are down to normal.

1367
01:53:03,917 --> 01:53:08,115
It's precisely for that reason
that we are conducting this trial.

1368
01:53:08,237 --> 01:53:10,467
You don't expect me
to endorse a therapy...

1369
01:53:10,597 --> 01:53:13,669
just on the basis
of one hopeful observation?

1370
01:53:13,797 --> 01:53:16,914
There's two! My boy's been
takin' the oil for six months.

1371
01:53:17,037 --> 01:53:20,154
Yes, Ellard, and his blood levels
are down to normal. He's fine.

1372
01:53:20,277 --> 01:53:22,109
You are playing with people's hopes.

1373
01:53:22,238 --> 01:53:27,232
Where do these Odones get off, thinking
they know more than the doctors?

1374
01:53:27,358 --> 01:53:30,634
Where did you get this oil?
-The Odones. They get it from England.

1375
01:53:30,758 --> 01:53:32,645
They don't have approval from the FDA.

1376
01:53:32,646 --> 01:53:34,831
It's bootleg. Give
the doctors a chance...

1377
01:53:34,958 --> 01:53:37,631
Come on, Ellard!
It's a mixture of two cooking oils.

1378
01:53:37,758 --> 01:53:40,074
Two cooking oils? What's
the dosage, please?

1379
01:53:40,075 --> 01:53:41,876
What are the side effects of this?

1380
01:53:41,998 --> 01:53:44,910
How would we pay for it?
-There must be a formal protocol...

1381
01:53:45,038 --> 01:53:49,510
before we can raise funds. I understand
it will cost over $1,000 a litre.

1382
01:53:49,639 --> 01:53:55,350
And no insurance company or government
will support you without the approval.

1383
01:53:55,479 --> 01:53:58,437
And the only way to get it
is through thorough testing.

1384
01:53:58,559 --> 01:54:02,029
That's what they told AIDS people
about AZT, but they fought and got it.

1385
01:54:02,159 --> 01:54:05,674
Because they were dying.
They didn't have time to wait...

1386
01:54:05,799 --> 01:54:08,950
We padded our walls yesterday!
I want that oil!

1387
01:54:16,720 --> 01:54:18,836
May 1988
Lorenzo's Tenth Birthday

1388
01:54:18,960 --> 01:54:22,509
There, my darling. That's a sweet boy.

1389
01:54:24,360 --> 01:54:26,316
What a big, strong boy.

1390
01:54:27,160 --> 01:54:29,515
Yes, my darling. Yes.

1391
01:55:01,001 --> 01:55:02,560
You see, Michaela,...

1392
01:55:02,682 --> 01:55:06,880
it's as though he is trapped
down in some dark cave.

1393
01:55:08,322 --> 01:55:13,396
Because he's lost so much myelin,
he can't find his way out.

1394
01:55:13,522 --> 01:55:17,151
Now, we know
his simple functions are intact.

1395
01:55:17,282 --> 01:55:20,877
He breathes, he swallows,
his heart beats.

1396
01:55:21,602 --> 01:55:26,357
And from the outside world,
he receives sensation.

1397
01:55:26,482 --> 01:55:28,439
A touch,...

1398
01:55:30,003 --> 01:55:31,959
pain, cold.

1399
01:55:32,603 --> 01:55:35,800
And here are the primal feelings.

1400
01:55:35,923 --> 01:55:38,960
Fear, hunger, desire.

1401
01:55:40,483 --> 01:55:45,921
While up here in the neocortex,
the higher brain, locked here,...

1402
01:55:46,043 --> 01:55:50,161
are his reasoning,
imagination, memory.

1403
01:55:51,283 --> 01:55:54,037
The things that make us each ourselves.

1404
01:55:59,004 --> 01:56:00,960
So how does he reach us?

1405
01:56:03,884 --> 01:56:07,035
When a simple swallow
is such a huge task?

1406
01:56:10,484 --> 01:56:12,440
To find...

1407
01:56:13,044 --> 01:56:16,878
To find the way,
the path from his mind...

1408
01:56:18,645 --> 01:56:20,601
to the outside world...

1409
01:56:22,605 --> 01:56:25,961
is like willing himself
through a brick wall.

1410
01:56:28,165 --> 01:56:30,121
So he waits, huh?

1411
01:56:35,085 --> 01:56:37,041
He waits.

1412
01:56:39,245 --> 01:56:41,201
Michaela...

1413
01:56:46,366 --> 01:56:48,322
Do you ever think...

1414
01:56:51,006 --> 01:56:52,962
that...

1415
01:56:54,446 --> 01:56:57,404
maybe all this struggle,...

1416
01:56:59,486 --> 01:57:03,035
it may have been for
somebody else's kid?

1417
01:57:21,167 --> 01:57:23,123
Yes.

1418
01:57:52,408 --> 01:57:55,161
But I promised... I promised him...

1419
01:57:55,888 --> 01:57:58,244
his world would never be silent.

1420
01:58:00,129 --> 01:58:02,085
He would never be alone.

1421
01:58:03,569 --> 01:58:05,321
Yes.

1422
01:58:05,889 --> 01:58:07,845
Two Years Later

1423
01:58:08,049 --> 01:58:10,768
"One morning,
a little rabbit sat on a bank."

1424
01:58:10,889 --> 01:58:15,041
"He pricked his ears and listened
to the trit-trot, trit-trot of a pony."

1425
01:58:15,169 --> 01:58:18,639
"A gig was coming along the road.
It was driven by Mr McGregor."

1426
01:58:18,769 --> 01:58:22,125
"And beside him sat Mrs McGregor
in her best bonnet."

1427
01:58:22,249 --> 01:58:25,845
"As soon as they had passed, little
Benjamin Bunny slid down into the road...

1428
01:58:25,970 --> 01:58:29,883
and set off with a hop, skip and a jump
to call upon his relations,...

1429
01:58:30,010 --> 01:58:33,559
who lived in the woods
at the back of Mr McGregor's garden."

1430
01:58:33,690 --> 01:58:38,127
"That wood was full of rabbit holes, and
in the neatest, sandiest hole of all...

1431
01:58:38,250 --> 01:58:43,165
lived Benjamin's aunt and his cousins,
Flopsy, Mopsy, Cottontail and Peter."

1432
01:58:43,290 --> 01:58:46,487
"Old Mrs Rabbit was a widow. She"

1433
01:58:46,610 --> 01:58:50,047
"earned her living by knitting
rabbit-wool mittens and muffeties."

1434
01:58:50,171 --> 01:58:52,127
"I once bought a pair"

1435
01:58:53,571 --> 01:58:56,529
What's the matter, darling?
You don't like the story?

1436
01:59:03,851 --> 01:59:05,603
Lorenzo...

1437
01:59:07,531 --> 01:59:09,169
You don't like the story?

1438
01:59:11,891 --> 01:59:13,769
He does that a lot lately.

1439
01:59:13,892 --> 01:59:16,042
When?
-Mainly at story time.

1440
01:59:17,212 --> 01:59:19,168
Sweetheart...

1441
01:59:19,652 --> 01:59:21,608
Listen carefully to Mama.

1442
01:59:23,572 --> 01:59:26,211
Is your middle name Patrick?

1443
01:59:30,012 --> 01:59:33,084
No... Is it Peter?

1444
01:59:36,172 --> 01:59:38,208
No, Mommy.

1445
01:59:38,332 --> 01:59:41,052
Is it Michael? Michael Murphy?

1446
01:59:44,053 --> 01:59:45,645
Yes! Yes!

1447
01:59:45,773 --> 01:59:47,729
Only you don't know how to say that.

1448
01:59:47,853 --> 01:59:50,208
Will you teach Mommy how to say no?

1449
01:59:50,333 --> 01:59:53,484
When you close your eyes,
does that mean no?

1450
01:59:53,613 --> 01:59:56,685
Oh, what an idiot!
That was a yes question.

1451
01:59:56,813 --> 02:00:01,682
All right. You don't want to hear
any more Benjamin Bunny, do you?

1452
02:00:04,294 --> 02:00:07,650
That's an emphatic reply!
Very well, young man.

1453
02:00:08,694 --> 02:00:13,688
No more Benjamin Bunny. How could
Mommy have been so thoughtless?

1454
02:00:13,814 --> 02:00:18,285
We're going to take all of these
baby books to the children's hospital.

1455
02:00:18,414 --> 02:00:21,804
It's time for the big stuff.
Something heroic.

1456
02:00:21,934 --> 02:00:24,812
There you go.
You gotta tell us what you want.

1457
02:00:24,934 --> 02:00:27,971
The Once and Future King by TH White.

1458
02:00:30,615 --> 02:00:35,006
"The boy slept well in the woodland nest,
where he had laid himself down."

1459
02:00:35,135 --> 02:00:38,093
"At first, he only dipped
below the surface of sleep...

1460
02:00:38,215 --> 02:00:41,252
and skimmed along
like a salmon in shallow water,...

1461
02:00:41,375 --> 02:00:45,732
so close to the surface
that he fancied himself in air."

1462
02:00:46,615 --> 02:00:49,891
"He thought himself awake,
when he was already asleep."

1463
02:00:50,015 --> 02:00:51,687
"He saw the stars above his face,...

1464
02:00:51,815 --> 02:00:54,728
whirling on their silent
and sleepless axis,...

1465
02:00:54,856 --> 02:00:58,246
and the leaves of the trees
rustling against them."

1466
02:00:58,376 --> 02:01:01,448
"And he heard small changes
in the grass."

1467
02:01:01,576 --> 02:01:05,888
"These little noises of footsteps
and soft-fringed wing beats...

1468
02:01:06,016 --> 02:01:08,655
and stealthy bellies
drawn over the grass blades."

1469
02:01:08,776 --> 02:01:14,134
"A rattling against the bracken at first
frightened him, but interested him."

1470
02:01:19,457 --> 02:01:21,095
OK. Is it your thumb?

1471
02:01:23,777 --> 02:01:25,733
Is it your index finger?

1472
02:01:28,257 --> 02:01:30,213
Your middle finger?

1473
02:01:31,857 --> 02:01:34,087
Your little finger?

1474
02:01:34,217 --> 02:01:38,495
It's your little finger. You think
you can move your little finger.

1475
02:01:38,617 --> 02:01:42,246
OK. Tell your brain to tell your arm...

1476
02:01:42,377 --> 02:01:45,734
to tell your hand
to move your little finger.

1477
02:01:48,618 --> 02:01:51,576
Come on, sweetheart.
Tell your brain to tell your arm...

1478
02:01:51,698 --> 02:01:54,974
to tell your hand
to move your little finger.

1479
02:01:55,938 --> 02:01:58,498
Come on, my friend.
What a wonderful thing. A "yes".

1480
02:01:58,618 --> 02:02:01,337
And then there'll be
a "could be" and a "perhaps"...

1481
02:02:01,458 --> 02:02:04,848
and maybe even a "shut up, Mommy",
but now we just have to get to "yes".

1482
02:02:04,978 --> 02:02:07,936
So tell your brain to tell your arm...

1483
02:02:08,058 --> 02:02:11,210
to tell your hand
to move your little finger.

1484
02:02:14,339 --> 02:02:17,854
Come on, my love.
Tell your brain to tell your hand...

1485
02:02:18,259 --> 02:02:20,215
to move your little finger.

1486
02:02:23,019 --> 02:02:26,136
Come on, Lorenzo.
-You can do it, my friend.

1487
02:02:26,259 --> 02:02:28,215
You can do it.

1488
02:02:29,539 --> 02:02:31,495
Come on, Lorenzo.

1489
02:02:46,860 --> 02:02:50,933
UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN
School of Veterinary Medicine

1490
02:02:51,060 --> 02:02:54,336
And they are born
without myelin, correct?

1491
02:02:54,460 --> 02:02:58,419
The only naturally dismyelinated
higher mammals in existence.

1492
02:02:58,540 --> 02:03:00,816
And this is passed
from mother to son?

1493
02:03:00,941 --> 02:03:02,852
Yes.

1494
02:03:02,981 --> 02:03:06,132
Their mother is from Edinburgh.
That's Jasmine.

1495
02:03:06,261 --> 02:03:08,616
She doesn't shake, but her male pups do.

1496
02:03:09,141 --> 02:03:13,453
You think you can stop them shaking?
-Well, we hope so.

1497
02:03:13,581 --> 02:03:17,859
By implanting nerve cells, we expect
to see the growth of new myelin.

1498
02:03:17,981 --> 02:03:21,257
We've been partially remyelinating
rats and mice for ten years,...

1499
02:03:21,381 --> 02:03:23,531
and it's repeatable.

1500
02:03:24,501 --> 02:03:29,701
But if we could fund this work,
it could be the first in higher animals.

1501
02:03:29,822 --> 02:03:32,620
And then in human beings, huh?

1502
02:03:32,742 --> 02:03:34,698
Well, in time, yes.

1503
02:03:35,342 --> 02:03:38,812
Dr Duncan,
if I help you raise these funds...

1504
02:03:38,942 --> 02:03:42,139
and if we can get the researchers
together to collaborate,...

1505
02:03:42,262 --> 02:03:46,460
I think we can achieve
very much in a very short time.

1506
02:03:46,582 --> 02:03:50,257
Augusto, we scientists
are a very competitive lot.

1507
02:03:50,382 --> 02:03:55,662
Such a collaboration is a lovely idea,
but sadly that is not how science works.

1508
02:03:55,783 --> 02:04:00,493
That's not necessarily so, because
remember the Manhattan Project?

1509
02:04:00,623 --> 02:04:04,411
28 months. It took them 28 months.

1510
02:04:04,543 --> 02:04:08,695
Now, if scientists can come together
to build the atomic bomb,...

1511
02:04:08,823 --> 02:04:13,533
surely they come together
to remyelinate some puppy dogs?

1512
02:04:24,664 --> 02:04:27,132
Papa called from Italy, darling.

1513
02:04:27,264 --> 02:04:30,939
He's missing his Lorenzacchio
very, very much.

1514
02:04:31,064 --> 02:04:34,977
But he wants me to tell you
he's making a big dinner tonight,...

1515
02:04:35,104 --> 02:04:39,063
a banquet of brain food for
the cleverest doctors in the world...

1516
02:04:39,184 --> 02:04:43,178
who've gathered together to put the
myelin back in the shaking puppy dogs.

1517
02:04:43,305 --> 02:04:45,773
And if they can achieve that,...

1518
02:04:45,905 --> 02:04:50,535
someday there might be a way to help
all the people who've lost their myelin.

1519
02:04:50,665 --> 02:04:54,578
Not only the boys with ALD,
but the people with multiple sclerosis...

1520
02:04:54,705 --> 02:04:57,265
and many other diseases, Lorenzo.

1521
02:04:58,065 --> 02:05:02,775
And then think, my brave boy, if they
can ever give you back your myelin,...

1522
02:05:02,905 --> 02:05:08,856
you'll be able to tell your brain to tell
your toes, your fingers, your anything,

1523
02:05:08,986 --> 02:05:11,784
to do what you want them to do.
-... what I want them to do.

1524
02:05:11,906 --> 02:05:14,136
And then, one day,...

1525
02:05:14,906 --> 02:05:16,976
I'll hear my voice...

1526
02:05:17,106 --> 02:05:21,657
and all these words I'm thinking
will get outside my head.

1527
02:05:26,226 --> 02:05:29,696
This film was completed
at the end of 1992 and so far...

1528
02:05:29,826 --> 02:05:34,025
Doctors all over the world have
begun to prescribe Lorenzo's Oil.

1529
02:05:34,147 --> 02:05:38,504
If a diagnosis is made early enough
the treatment stops the disease.

1530
02:05:38,627 --> 02:05:43,064
So there is now a growing army of boys
kept free from the ravages of ALD.

1531
02:05:43,187 --> 02:05:48,307
In recognition of this, Augusto Odone
received an honorary medical degree.

1532
02:05:48,427 --> 02:05:53,455
He and Michaela continue to raise funds
and drive the scientific task force...

1533
02:05:53,587 --> 02:05:55,782
known as "The Myelin Project".

1534
02:05:55,907 --> 02:05:59,457
The Shaking Pups are
successfully growing new myelin.

1535
02:05:59,588 --> 02:06:03,058
This means that human trials
will begin within a year.

1536
02:06:03,188 --> 02:06:07,545
There are many waiting to receive
the first brain cell transplants.

1537
02:06:07,668 --> 02:06:10,546
Among them is
Lorenzo Michael Murphy Odone.

1538
02:06:11,668 --> 02:06:14,136
Meanwhile... Lorenzo is 14 years old.

1539
02:06:14,268 --> 02:06:17,260
He is now able to move
his head from side to side.

1540
02:06:17,388 --> 02:06:21,666
He has recovered his eyesight
and begun to vocalise simple sounds.

1541
02:06:21,788 --> 02:06:25,179
He is learning to communicate
by means of a computer.

1542
02:06:25,309 --> 02:06:28,062
And so he waits,
for what will come next...

1543
02:06:32,349 --> 02:06:34,499
Oh! Now it broke!

1544
02:06:38,589 --> 02:06:41,149
This is Charles and this is Harry...

1545
02:06:41,269 --> 02:06:44,147
and they've both been on
Lorenzo's Oil for two years.

1546
02:06:44,269 --> 02:06:47,546
My name is Michael Benton
and I'm twelve and a half years old.

1547
02:06:47,670 --> 02:06:50,980
I've been taking Lorenzo's Oil
for four and a half years.

1548
02:06:51,110 --> 02:06:56,742
I was diagnosed with ALD when I was
13 years old. I'm taking Lorenzo's Oil...

1549
02:06:56,870 --> 02:06:59,668
I've been taking Lorenzo's Oil
for three years.

1550
02:06:59,790 --> 02:07:04,420
Some of the activities I'm involved in
are baseball, basketball...

1551
02:07:09,790 --> 02:07:24,420
