1
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:49,377
Wake up, my beauties.

2
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:51,509
Rise and shine.

3
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:54,714
It's a brand-new day,
and the mortal world

4
00:00:54,754 --> 00:00:56,654
is at peace.

5
00:00:56,689 --> 00:00:59,180
But not for long.

6
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:03,321
Just look at them.

7
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:05,297
I pull one tiny thread,

8
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:08,789
and their whole world unravels
into chaos.

9
00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:12,828
Glorious chaos.

10
00:01:12,872 --> 00:01:18,469
And what could be more
perfect than this?

11
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:20,445
A noble prince,

12
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,448
a priceless treasure,

13
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:26,179
and a black-hearted thief.

14
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:29,882
Oh, this is going to be fun.

15
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:32,187
Cetus?

16
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:34,250
You know what to do.

17
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:37,320
Let the games begin.

18
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:52,572
Gentlemen, this is
what we've been waiting for.

19
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:54,978
The world's most valuable object

20
00:01:55,014 --> 00:01:57,983
is on its way to Syracuse.

21
00:01:58,017 --> 00:02:00,417
It's a shame
it'll never get there.

22
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:05,047
After today, we retire to Fiji.

23
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:07,616
- Fiji!
- Fiji!

24
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,088
Kale!

25
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:11,152
Aye, Captain.

26
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:13,663
Spike!

27
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:17,894
Let's get rich!

28
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,231
Did you catch
that last move?

29
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:56,071
Pretty cool, huh?

30
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:57,576
I thought you
overworked it.

31
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:58,770
Just a bit.

32
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:00,545
Aw, y...

33
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,774
Overworked it?

34
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:09,483
Oh, and I was overworking it?

35
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:14,156
Proteus.

36
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:15,353
Whoa.

37
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:17,329
This just got interesting.

38
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:19,058
How long has it been?

39
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:20,929
About a lifetime ago.

40
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:28,801
You still fight
like an old lady.

41
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:29,830
Sinbad?

42
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,571
Oh. Ooh.

43
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:32,873
Sinbad.

44
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:35,005
What...?
What are you doing here?

45
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,743
I'm working.

46
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:38,877
You?

47
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:40,112
What happened to you?

48
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:41,347
Where have you been?

49
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,412
Hey, love to stop and catch up,

50
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:47,119
but I've got things to do,
places to go, stuff to steal.

51
00:03:56,502 --> 00:03:59,403
Oh... yeah.

52
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,203
Sinbad,
we need to talk.

53
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:05,211
Heard about it,
read about it,

54
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:06,778
never actually seen it.

55
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:14,842
The Book of Peace.

56
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:17,981
It's my job to bring it
safely to Syracuse.

57
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:20,356
Really? Now, see, now,
I- I just feel bad,

58
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:22,486
because you're going
to get fired.

59
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:24,018
You can't be serious.

60
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:26,623
You disappear for ten years,
show up, and rob me?

61
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:27,792
I wish it wasn't you.

62
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:28,926
I do.

63
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:29,992
Really.

64
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:32,800
- But...
- But it is me, Sinbad.

65
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:36,331
Proteus, we had a special
handshake, some code words,

66
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:37,570
a secret hideout.

67
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:41,444
It was fun, big fun,
but, uh, we were kids.

68
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:42,778
We were friends!

69
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:44,407
You're not going
to steal this.

70
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,008
Not from me.

71
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:48,384
And what would you
do with it anyway?

72
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:51,254
The Book of Peace protects
all of us in the Twelve Cities.

73
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,258
Exactly.

74
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,919
So, just imagine
how much all of us

75
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,120
will pay to get it back.

76
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:56,355
Let me say it again.

77
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:58,660
A long time ago,
you and I were friends.

78
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:02,657
If that ever meant anything
to you, prove it now.

79
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:04,101
You're right.

80
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,867
That was a long time ago.

81
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:16,277
Come on.
Don't get all heroic, Proteus.

82
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:26,884
If you want the Book,
you have to go through me.

83
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:34,557
What the...?

84
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:40,463
Dear gods.

85
00:05:56,956 --> 00:05:59,823
Go, Spike.

86
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,961
I gotcha! I gotcha!

87
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:08,963
Well, I see you're busy.

88
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:11,526
So, uh, stay in touch.

89
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:12,697
Wait! Wait!

90
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:14,206
You're just going
to run away?

91
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,208
Uh, yeah.

92
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:19,605
Wh-whoa!

93
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:27,045
Sinbad!

94
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:29,350
You! My...!

95
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:30,650
My ship!

96
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,568
Heads up!

97
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:58,175
Now...
stand by for sushi.

98
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:14,724
Give that guy a raise.

99
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:18,863
Come on!
Come on, Sinbad!

100
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:19,963
Let's go!

101
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:21,064
Wait.
Stand your ground.

102
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,404
W- What are you doing?

103
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,636
Hey!

104
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:24,643
Hey, hey!

105
00:07:24,677 --> 00:07:26,804
Lobster Boy, over here!

106
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:34,113
Run!

107
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:35,780
Fall back!

108
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:40,224
Grab hold!

109
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:44,320
Let's go!

110
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:48,594
Come on!

111
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:52,836
And the plan?

112
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:55,136
How about try not to get killed?

113
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:56,766
Hold on!

114
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,339
Here, you'll need this.

115
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:02,244
Where are you going?

116
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:03,441
Fishing!

117
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:09,822
Left, right, left, right,
left, right, left, right.

118
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,135
Now!

119
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:38,979
Whoo!

120
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:41,280
Woo-hoo!

121
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:47,150
- Oh...
- You okay?

122
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,125
Yeah.

123
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,094
Thanks for sticking around.

124
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:52,620
Ah, just like old times.

125
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:54,763
Look out!

126
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,665
Sinbad!

127
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:32,629
The day began with such promise.

128
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:35,732
And now look.

129
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:37,538
My sea monster is dead,

130
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:40,942
and I still don't have
the Book of Peace.

131
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,414
All because of you, Sinbad.

132
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:45,474
Uh-huh.

133
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:47,145
And you are?

134
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:50,155
Eris, the Goddess of Discord.

135
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:51,451
No doubt you've seen
my likeness

136
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:54,288
on the temple walls.

137
00:09:55,494 --> 00:09:57,724
You know,
they don't do you justice.

138
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,731
Uh-huh. Now...

139
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,494
about my sea monster.

140
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:03,001
Right, right.

141
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:04,764
Listen, I'm sorry
about that.

142
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:07,705
I don't suppose a heartfelt
apology would do.

143
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:11,038
Heartfelt? From you?

144
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:14,274
Sinbad, you don't have a heart.

145
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:19,410
That's what I like about you.

146
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:22,683
So, I'm going
to let you live.

147
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:25,384
But there's
just one little thing

148
00:10:25,424 --> 00:10:27,016
you have to do.

149
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:30,426
Get the Book of Peace
and bring it to me.

150
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,487
Right. Hmm.

151
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:32,758
Now, see, that's
a problem for me

152
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,595
because I had
my own plans for it.

153
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:35,601
Uh, ransom, get rich.

154
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:36,600
You know, "me" stuff.

155
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:41,436
You're not thinking
big enough, Sinbad.

156
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:42,873
Steal the Book for ransom,

157
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:44,375
and you'll be
rich enough

158
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,173
to lounge
on an island beach.

159
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:50,615
Steal the Book for me,
and you can buy the beach,

160
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:54,245
and the island and the world.

161
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:55,344
Hmm.

162
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:57,356
You let me live,
you make me rich,

163
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,551
I retire to paradise.

164
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:02,390
So far, I don't see a downside.

165
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:04,362
If you keep your word.

166
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:07,332
Sinbad, when a goddess
gives her word,

167
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:09,630
she's bound for all eternity.

168
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:11,602
All right, you're on.

169
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:13,730
I knew you'd
see it my way.

170
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:17,368
So, when you've
stolen the Book,

171
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:20,868
follow that star
beyond the horizon.

172
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:22,505
You'll find yourself

173
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:26,314
in Tartarus,
my Realm of Chaos.

174
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:27,512
Tartarus.

175
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:29,180
I'll see you there.

176
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:30,813
It's a date then.

177
00:11:32,658 --> 00:11:34,387
So, where were we?

178
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:35,985
Oh, yes.

179
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:39,225
You were holding your breath.

180
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,799
He's so cute.

181
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:52,004
And so gullible.

182
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:54,945
Cetus, well done.

183
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:06,289
Sinbad, you're alive!

184
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:08,088
Glad you made it.

185
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:09,822
Pay up.
He lived.

186
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:12,291
What happened down there?

187
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:13,525
You wouldn't...

188
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:14,692
believe me if I told you.

189
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,062
Try me.

190
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:17,865
All right, here goes.

191
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:20,701
So I meet Eris,
the Goddess of Chaos.

192
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:22,296
She's got
a major crush on me,

193
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:24,309
and she invited me
back to her place.

194
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:27,708
Ha! That's a good one!

195
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,510
Goddess of Chaos?

196
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:31,015
Oh, I'm writing that down.

197
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,984
So, that's it then?
No Book.

198
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:34,542
Now what do we do?

199
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:35,884
A little patience, Rat.

200
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,684
It's not like we don't know
where it's going.

201
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:42,852
Men, all sails to Syracuse!

202
00:12:42,895 --> 00:12:44,760
Right away, sir!

203
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,433
For as long
as I can remember,

204
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,167
I've dreamed of this moment.

205
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:30,266
The sacred treasure

206
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,869
that's protected us
for a thousand years

207
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:35,005
is now in Syracuse.

208
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:36,776
- A toast!
- To Dymas!

209
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:37,541
Hear, hear!

210
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:38,914
To the Book of Peace!

211
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:41,215
And to you, King Dymas
and Prince Proteus.

212
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:44,313
Make way!

213
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:48,323
You see?

214
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,885
This is what happens
when you use the front entrance.

215
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,192
Mm-hmm.

216
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:53,789
What is he doing here?

217
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:56,197
At least he's not out
robbing someone.

218
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:59,398
That's because everyone
worth robbing is here.

219
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:03,432
I'll bet you ten crowns

220
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:05,272
you're about to put
those swords down.

221
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,778
I'll take that bet.

222
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:07,801
Guards...

223
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,370
put away your swords.

224
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:11,610
I don't see you for ten years,

225
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:14,346
and now twice in one day...

226
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:15,785
You're smothering me.

227
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:20,455
I knew you'd want to thank me
for saving your life... again.

228
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:24,658
You probably just heard
we had free food and wine.

229
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:25,664
You hear that, guys?

230
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,928
Dinner and drinks
are on the prince.

231
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:29,127
Come on.

232
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:30,863
There's someone
I want you to meet.

233
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:33,397
Get to work.

234
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:35,696
Weapons?

235
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:49,945
Here she is.

236
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:51,251
I've told her
all about you.

237
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:55,520
Sinbad, I would
like to introduce you

238
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:56,858
to my fiancee,

239
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,490
the Lady Marina,
Ambassador from Thrace.

240
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:06,332
So, this is the infamous Sinbad.

241
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:08,397
I heard all about this morning.

242
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:12,342
First you tried to rob Proteus,
and then you save his life.

243
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:14,535
So, which are you...

244
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,878
a thief or a hero?

245
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:19,008
Sinbad wanted

246
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:21,144
to give me an opportunity
to thank...

247
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:25,122
...him.

248
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:30,658
Eight months on the sea

249
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:33,221
with nothing but eggs
and pickles...

250
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:36,029
you don't know what
that can do to a man.

251
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:38,536
Oh, it's almost too easy.

252
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,561
There's only
a handful of guards.

253
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:41,573
Forget it.

254
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:42,869
Let's get back to the ship.

255
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:44,034
Just like that?

256
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:45,941
But the Book is almost ours.

257
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:50,282
Oh.

258
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:52,045
Wh-What?
Who is she?

259
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:53,608
An old girlfriend?

260
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:55,483
I'm afraid it's
not that simple.

261
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:57,352
Let's go.

262
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:59,857
Jed, pack it up.

263
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:02,156
What? I-I... I just put the...

264
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:13,364
Oh, this is just too easy.

265
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:16,406
Look at it this way:

266
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:17,602
Now that Sinbad's gone,

267
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,043
your father can finally relax
and enjoy the evening.

268
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,707
Well, you're right about that.

269
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:24,113
He's trying not to show it,

270
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:28,085
but he's so proud
to have the Book in Syracuse.

271
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,487
He's been planning this day
his whole life.

272
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:35,186
And soon it will be
your responsibility.

273
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:37,286
Our responsibility.

274
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:44,726
It's beautiful.

275
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:45,964
It is.

276
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,735
My father spent years
preparing it for the Book.

277
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:50,503
There are guards
on every level,

278
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:52,169
and if you look
up to the...

279
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:56,143
Ah...

280
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:58,615
You were talking about
the ocean, weren't you?

281
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:02,882
I only wish I'd
seen more of it.

282
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:07,449
I used to imagine sailing
far beyond the Twelve Cities,

283
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:09,154
discovering the world.

284
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:12,991
Oh, look at it, Proteus.

285
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,796
There's so much wonder.

286
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:17,301
Marina...

287
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:23,165
Our marriage was arranged
many years ago.

288
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,301
It's always been expected of us.

289
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:28,711
But politics is not a reason
to get married.

290
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:30,715
Uh, and I don't want you
to do this

291
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:32,376
just because it's your duty.

292
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,118
I'm asking you
for myself now.

293
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:38,783
Marina...

294
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:42,384
will you marry me?

295
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:44,453
Proteus, I...

296
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:45,827
There you are!

297
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:47,024
I think the delegates
from Manoli

298
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:48,157
are trying to give a toast.

299
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,565
Although, I'm not sure.

300
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:51,899
They're doing something
with their knees.

301
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:53,529
Marina, I need
an ambassador.

302
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:58,436
Of course, Sire.

303
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:17,228
Huh?

304
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:47,222
Who's there?

305
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,131
Huh?

306
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:03,239
Sinbad!

307
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:13,178
I love playing pretend.

308
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:24,622
All the pieces
are coming together.

309
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:30,129
Proteus, the Book!

310
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,461
Sinbad.

311
00:19:57,496 --> 00:19:58,724
Proteus!

312
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:00,561
It's about time.

313
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:02,624
Do you realize
how serious this is?

314
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:03,896
Do you realize

315
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:05,767
how many times
I've heard that today?

316
00:20:05,804 --> 00:20:06,736
You've betrayed Syracuse!

317
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:08,933
Oh... not you, too.

318
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:10,032
Stealing the Book of Peace,

319
00:20:10,075 --> 00:20:11,667
when you knew how much
it meant to us!

320
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,610
Proteus, here's
the way this works.

321
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:15,374
First, I actually
commit a crime,

322
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:17,405
and then you get
to blame me for it!

323
00:20:17,449 --> 00:20:20,418
Then how do
you explain this?

324
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:24,278
Eris.

325
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:25,153
What?

326
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:27,488
Eris... she framed me.

327
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:29,391
- Sinbad, listen to yourself.
- Trust me, Proteus,

328
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:31,862
the Book is in Tartarus.

329
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,797
Talk to your father.
Tell him I'm...

330
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:35,129
This is beyond my father.

331
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:37,692
The ambassadors are convening
now for your trial.

332
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,067
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

333
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:40,162
Trial? I didn't do it!

334
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:41,797
Look, I left the Book
on your ship,

335
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,330
and that's the
last I saw of it.

336
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:44,467
You were there.

337
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:46,409
You know the truth.

338
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:47,503
You know me.

339
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:49,070
Do I?

340
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:51,207
I knew a kid.

341
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:54,013
Who are you now, Sinbad?

342
00:20:55,687 --> 00:20:59,646
Look me in the eye
and tell me.

343
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:01,784
Did you steal the Book?

344
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:05,890
No.

345
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,060
We've heard enough of your lies.

346
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,127
Sinbad,

347
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:14,638
for the last time,
give us the Book.

348
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:17,608
How many times
do I have to say it?

349
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:19,008
I don't have it!

350
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:20,341
Very well, then.

351
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:21,778
The Delegation

352
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:24,577
of the Twelve Cities finds you
guilty of treason,

353
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,174
and we sentence you to die.

354
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:27,185
Take him away.

355
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:28,686
Come on!
This is a joke, right?

356
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,551
Are you...
are you people blind?

357
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:31,556
I didn't do it!

358
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:32,682
Stop!

359
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:36,694
I demand the right
of substitution.

360
00:21:36,728 --> 00:21:38,559
Take me in his place.

361
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:39,529
No!

362
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,561
Sinbad says

363
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,659
that Eris took the Book...

364
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:45,226
and I believe him.

365
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:47,261
Let him go to Tartarus
and recover the Book.

366
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:48,271
What?

367
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:50,632
What are you doing?

368
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:52,610
You claim that Eris
stole the Book...

369
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:53,633
steal it back.

370
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,010
You're good at that.

371
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:57,413
Hey, look, I will not be
responsible for your life.

372
00:21:57,449 --> 00:21:58,677
You would do
the same for me.

373
00:21:58,717 --> 00:21:59,945
No, I wouldn't.

374
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,850
If Sinbad is allowed to leave

375
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:04,412
the city, he'll
never come back!

376
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:06,287
Son, listen to reason.

377
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:08,952
No, Father, you listen.

378
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:12,589
Sinbad either stole the Book,
or he's telling the truth

379
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:13,996
and it's in Tartarus.

380
00:22:14,032 --> 00:22:16,592
Either way,
he's our only hope.

381
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:18,227
But you can't...

382
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:22,570
Proteus, you realize that
if Sinbad does not return,

383
00:22:22,607 --> 00:22:25,735
you will be put to death
in his place.

384
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:29,573
I understand.

385
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,111
So be it.

386
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:33,947
Sinbad has ten days

387
00:22:33,985 --> 00:22:36,044
to return the Book.

388
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:39,215
Release him.

389
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:01,843
Oh, and, Sinbad...

390
00:23:03,014 --> 00:23:05,380
don't be late.

391
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:38,949
Hmm.

392
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:45,149
So, any idea

393
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:46,987
how we actually
get to Tartarus?

394
00:23:47,025 --> 00:23:48,049
Tartarus?

395
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,253
Oh, no, no, no, no.

396
00:23:49,294 --> 00:23:51,353
People get killed in Tartarus.

397
00:23:51,396 --> 00:23:53,330
So where are we going?

398
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:56,325
Fiji.

399
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:59,394
Fiji? This time of year?

400
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:00,769
Think of the beaches.

401
00:24:00,806 --> 00:24:03,400
Oh, beautiful,
if you like mosquitoes.

402
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:04,497
Think of the sun.

403
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:06,408
It's monsoon season.

404
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:08,276
Oh, then the women.

405
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:09,678
They're cannibals, Sinbad.

406
00:24:09,714 --> 00:24:11,773
Exactly.

407
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:14,218
Come on, Kale.

408
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:15,742
He's your friend.

409
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:18,221
Listen to you.
You sound like my mother.

410
00:24:18,256 --> 00:24:19,553
Proteus will be fine.

411
00:24:19,591 --> 00:24:20,819
You're sure of that?

412
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:22,053
You and I both know

413
00:24:22,093 --> 00:24:24,152
Dymas is not going to let them
execute his only son.

414
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:25,424
So we're running away?

415
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:26,795
We're retiring.

416
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:29,096
We don't need another score.
We've got enough.

417
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,659
Now, set a course for Fiji.

418
00:24:31,703 --> 00:24:34,968
Gentlemen,
we're heading to Fiji!

419
00:24:35,006 --> 00:24:36,633
Fiji! Fiji!

420
00:24:38,243 --> 00:24:41,679
Kale... Book.

421
00:24:41,713 --> 00:24:43,078
Proteus.

422
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:47,509
Look at all this.

423
00:24:48,353 --> 00:24:50,719
I can't believe it.

424
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:52,746
Oh, but this can't be real.

425
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:54,122
It'd be far too deli...

426
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,751
Uh-oh.

427
00:24:58,563 --> 00:25:00,793
This is more like it.

428
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:02,322
Stolen from Venezia.

429
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:05,302
From Pompeii...

430
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:08,465
And from a brothel
in Syracuse.

431
00:25:08,573 --> 00:25:09,733
Good guess.

432
00:25:11,209 --> 00:25:12,608
What do you think
you're doing here?

433
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:15,044
I'm here to make sure you
get the Book of Peace.

434
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,173
Or bring back your
dead body if you fail.

435
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:18,477
Really?

436
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,041
And how are you going
to pull that off?

437
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:21,609
By whatever means necessary.

438
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:23,018
Did you bring a crew?

439
00:25:23,054 --> 00:25:24,214
No.

440
00:25:24,256 --> 00:25:25,348
You know how to
get to Tartarus?

441
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:26,357
Um... no.

442
00:25:26,391 --> 00:25:27,380
Can you navigate
on your own?

443
00:25:27,425 --> 00:25:28,050
Yes!

444
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:29,424
Well, good!

445
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:31,190
Then I'll dump your butt
in a rowboat,

446
00:25:31,229 --> 00:25:33,493
and you can paddle
all the way back to Syracuse.

447
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:36,399
'Cause we're going to Fiji.

448
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:39,036
Fiji?

449
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:40,094
Yup.

450
00:25:40,138 --> 00:25:43,130
Just as I thought.

451
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:44,505
What?

452
00:25:44,576 --> 00:25:45,668
Sinbad,

453
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:48,702
you're not
a very complicated guy.

454
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:49,805
All someone has to do

455
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:51,941
is imagine the most
gutless course of action,

456
00:25:51,983 --> 00:25:53,348
and you're bound to take it.

457
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:55,717
Hey, this is not my problem.

458
00:25:55,754 --> 00:25:57,847
I did not steal the Book.

459
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:01,188
You're really not going to lose
any sleep over this, are you?

460
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:02,193
Not a wink.

461
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:04,525
Because me,
I'd be tossing and turning,

462
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:08,693
knowing I'm alive...
because I let my friend die.

463
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:11,797
I'm not responsible
for this mess.

464
00:26:11,836 --> 00:26:12,928
And I didn't ask Proteus

465
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:14,199
to put his neck
on the line for me.

466
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:17,470
<i>Look, clearly I can't
appeal to your honor.</i>

467
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:20,376
But I have other ways
of convincing you.

468
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,243
Really?

469
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:25,215
Uh... just how do you
expect to do that?

470
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,343
By speaking your language.

471
00:26:29,554 --> 00:26:31,146
Keep talking.

472
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:39,997
Yup, this'll do!

473
00:26:40,031 --> 00:26:42,829
But not for first class.

474
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:47,204
As you can see, we're
well equipped to accommodate

475
00:26:47,238 --> 00:26:49,798
the most discerning
of royal tastes.

476
00:26:49,841 --> 00:26:52,241
We have excellent ocean views...

477
00:26:54,145 --> 00:26:56,443
...luxurious living quarters,

478
00:26:56,481 --> 00:26:58,574
with three
gourmet meals a day...

479
00:26:58,683 --> 00:27:01,709
pickles, eggs, and pickles.

480
00:27:02,887 --> 00:27:04,115
Oh, hey, Spike,
there you are.

481
00:27:04,155 --> 00:27:05,520
I'd like to introduce you

482
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:06,581
to your new bunkmate...
well, actually,

483
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:07,988
you're his new bunkmate,

484
00:27:08,026 --> 00:27:09,584
as it's actually his bunk.

485
00:27:11,763 --> 00:27:12,752
We do hope

486
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:15,197
<i>you have a pleasant stay
aboard the Chimera.</i>

487
00:27:15,233 --> 00:27:17,428
Oh, if he starts
hugging your leg,

488
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:19,027
it means he likes you.

489
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:21,470
If you think...

490
00:27:24,442 --> 00:27:27,570
How did she even get
on the ship?

491
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:36,142
Gentlemen, we have a new course.

492
00:27:36,187 --> 00:27:37,381
We're going to Tartarus.

493
00:27:37,422 --> 00:27:39,151
Huh? What
happened to Fiji?

494
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:40,179
What? No fun?

495
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:41,214
No beaches?

496
00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:43,056
Rat.

497
00:27:43,094 --> 00:27:44,618
Sorry, Captain.

498
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:46,926
But did you
say Tartarus?

499
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:47,932
That's right.

500
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:49,763
Will that be
the same Tartarus

501
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:51,860
from which no sailor
ever returns?

502
00:27:51,903 --> 00:27:53,837
The Tartarus
of lost souls,

503
00:27:53,872 --> 00:27:55,134
where they
grind your bones

504
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:56,606
and pickle your
spleen, and...

505
00:27:56,641 --> 00:27:58,336
No, Rat.
This is the nice Tartarus,

506
00:27:58,376 --> 00:27:59,866
with lots of beaches and drinks.

507
00:27:59,911 --> 00:28:02,141
You know,
with little umbrellas?

508
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,842
<i>Non ci posso credere,</i>

509
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:08,375
<i>non ci posso credere,
mi hanno fregato ancora.</i>

510
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:12,481
I'm only doing this
for the money.

511
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,287
Right.

512
00:28:14,325 --> 00:28:16,088
So how do we get there?

513
00:28:17,128 --> 00:28:19,392
That star's our point.

514
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:36,673
Wow.

515
00:28:36,781 --> 00:28:39,011
Our little thief
isn't going to run away.

516
00:28:40,151 --> 00:28:42,847
He thinks he's going to pay us
a visit.

517
00:28:44,022 --> 00:28:48,356
Hmm. Let's provide
some mood music.

518
00:29:02,273 --> 00:29:04,707
Oh, come on. You look great.

519
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:15,718
Look lively!
Jed, get the long poles!

520
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,412
Oh, pardon me, milady.

521
00:29:17,455 --> 00:29:19,013
Hey, we need
a pole over here.

522
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:20,115
Jin, one over here.

523
00:29:20,158 --> 00:29:22,854
Yeah, come on, come on, come on.

524
00:29:27,365 --> 00:29:29,265
The Dragon's Teeth?

525
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:35,062
Indeed, signorina.

526
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:36,698
Only the most
foolish of captains

527
00:29:36,741 --> 00:29:38,709
would dare to sail
a ship through this!

528
00:29:38,743 --> 00:29:40,540
Rat, reef the fores'le.

529
00:29:40,578 --> 00:29:43,376
Oh, ex-excuse me, signorina.

530
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:48,142
Are you sure
you know what...?

531
00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:49,676
Yes, we've done this
kind of thing before.

532
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:51,052
- No, there is no other way.
- Look...

533
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:52,181
- And, yes,
- But...

534
00:29:52,223 --> 00:29:54,521
you have my permission
to stand there quietly

535
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,220
and get a free lesson
in sailing.

536
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:57,228
You know...

537
00:29:57,262 --> 00:29:58,752
Besides, a ship is
no place for a woman.

538
00:29:59,831 --> 00:30:00,763
Jin!

539
00:30:00,832 --> 00:30:01,764
Easy on the main!

540
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:02,765
Aye!

541
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:31,120
Steady as she goes.

542
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:34,923
Rocks off the starboard bow!

543
00:30:56,154 --> 00:30:58,088
Steady.

544
00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:11,262
What is that sound?

545
00:31:11,302 --> 00:31:12,894
Shh.

546
00:31:21,312 --> 00:31:23,940
Sinbad, I...

547
00:31:25,617 --> 00:31:27,710
Sirens.

548
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,358
Sinbad.

549
00:31:46,437 --> 00:31:48,632
Sinbad!

550
00:31:48,673 --> 00:31:49,640
Jin?

551
00:31:49,674 --> 00:31:52,268
Li?

552
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:54,608
Come and get it, ladies!

553
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:55,977
Kale?

554
00:31:56,014 --> 00:31:57,345
Come with me.

555
00:31:57,382 --> 00:31:59,475
We'll speak of love.

556
00:31:59,517 --> 00:32:01,610
Oh...

557
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:03,553
Who's bad?

558
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,112
Sin-bad.

559
00:32:05,156 --> 00:32:07,215
Ah... men.

560
00:32:23,474 --> 00:32:25,066
I saw her first!

561
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:30,877
Round the deck! Now!

562
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:33,413
Yeah...

563
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:36,650
Amore!

564
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:38,349
Amore! Amore!

565
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:39,356
My darling.

566
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:40,254
Rat!

567
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:41,280
I love you.

568
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:47,196
Il mare e le onde andiamo via.

569
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:05,813
Spike!

570
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:06,817
Get Sinbad!

571
00:33:08,886 --> 00:33:09,511
Ow!

572
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:46,520
Spike, the blades!

573
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:36,464
Oh, my precious.

574
00:34:36,507 --> 00:34:37,997
Wake up, you idiot!

575
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:40,604
What happened?

576
00:34:40,645 --> 00:34:42,044
Sinbad saved us.

577
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:44,308
No, Marina.

578
00:34:44,348 --> 00:34:45,872
Marina saved us? Marina!

579
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:47,043
Marina saved us.

580
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:49,519
All right, men, snap out of it.

581
00:34:49,554 --> 00:34:50,919
Let's get back to reality.

582
00:34:50,955 --> 00:34:52,149
We got a ship to sail.

583
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:54,055
Here's my little hero.

584
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:55,592
You were so brave.

585
00:34:55,626 --> 00:34:57,958
Yeah. What a good dog.

586
00:34:57,995 --> 00:34:59,826
Uh...

587
00:34:59,864 --> 00:35:01,263
Uh...

588
00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:03,426
Still think a ship's
no place for a woman?

589
00:35:06,037 --> 00:35:07,368
Absolutely!

590
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,398
I mean, look at my ship!

591
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:12,932
This railing was
hand-carved mahogany!

592
00:35:12,977 --> 00:35:14,069
And here!

593
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:16,444
These moldings came
all the way from Damascus!

594
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:17,675
Do you have any idea

595
00:35:17,715 --> 00:35:19,842
what I went through
to steal these?

596
00:35:20,918 --> 00:35:24,615
That's exactly
why women shouldn't drive.

597
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:27,387
Are you crazy?

598
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:29,290
I saved your life!

599
00:35:29,327 --> 00:35:31,761
Oh, I would've been fine.

600
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:33,730
I always am.

601
00:35:33,764 --> 00:35:35,322
Right.

602
00:35:35,366 --> 00:35:37,266
So ungrateful.

603
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:38,734
It's just typical.

604
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,467
And you chipped the paint!

605
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:44,736
Right here...
look at it.

606
00:35:44,775 --> 00:35:46,367
That's more than
a little scratch.

607
00:36:04,629 --> 00:36:08,998
The dog and the crew
and th-th-that woman!

608
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:19,309
What?!

609
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:21,140
- Thank you!
- You're welcome!

610
00:36:21,212 --> 00:36:22,839
- No problem!
- Don't worry about it!

611
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,006
- I won't!
- Good!

612
00:36:24,048 --> 00:36:25,413
- Good-bye!
- Bye to you!

613
00:36:35,459 --> 00:36:36,824
You happy now?

614
00:36:57,815 --> 00:37:01,307
Proteus, come quickly.

615
00:37:01,352 --> 00:37:02,319
What? Wh...?

616
00:37:02,353 --> 00:37:03,820
There's a ship
waiting in the harbor.

617
00:37:03,854 --> 00:37:05,185
A crew of my most
trusted officers

618
00:37:05,256 --> 00:37:06,518
will take you
far from Syracuse.

619
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:08,422
But the ambassadors' guards?

620
00:37:08,459 --> 00:37:10,359
Are asleep or well-bribed.

621
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:11,827
But we must go now.

622
00:37:11,862 --> 00:37:13,955
Go where?

623
00:37:13,998 --> 00:37:16,398
To live the rest of my life
in exile?

624
00:37:16,434 --> 00:37:17,662
To live, son.

625
00:37:17,702 --> 00:37:20,603
I won't let them execute
you for Sinbad's crime.

626
00:37:20,638 --> 00:37:21,866
Neither will Sinbad.

627
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,533
Proteus, don't be foolish!

628
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:25,940
Sinbad has no intention
of going to Tartarus.

629
00:37:25,977 --> 00:37:27,911
The Sinbad you knew
as a child is...

630
00:37:27,945 --> 00:37:30,209
Is still in him as a man.

631
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,045
I've seen it.

632
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:34,244
Proteus...

633
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,447
Go, Father.

634
00:37:38,489 --> 00:37:41,151
I know what I'm doing.

635
00:37:59,543 --> 00:38:00,202
All right, listen up.

636
00:38:00,244 --> 00:38:01,506
We're here for ten minutes.

637
00:38:01,545 --> 00:38:03,308
You get lost, you get left.

638
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,350
How did one woman
do so much damage?

639
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,821
All right, I'm going to need
the full set of chisels,

640
00:38:12,857 --> 00:38:14,848
the jack plane,
and about a cord of cut wood.

641
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:16,651
All right, men, you
heard the captain.

642
00:38:16,694 --> 00:38:19,026
Find some logs
and be quick about it.

643
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:21,031
Oh, for heaven's sake!

644
00:38:21,065 --> 00:38:22,623
You only need
a little tree sap,

645
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:24,100
and she'll be
as good as new.

646
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,864
When I want
your advice, I'll...

647
00:38:25,903 --> 00:38:26,995
Hey, hey, hey!

648
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:29,165
Where do you think
you're going?

649
00:38:29,206 --> 00:38:31,037
Well, fine!
At least take someone with y...

650
00:38:31,075 --> 00:38:32,269
May I assist you, lady?

651
00:38:32,376 --> 00:38:33,900
Why, thank you.

652
00:38:33,944 --> 00:38:36,208
- Right this way, signorina.
- How nice to see

653
00:38:36,247 --> 00:38:38,977
some men haven't forgotten
a little common courtesy.

654
00:38:39,016 --> 00:38:40,608
...common courtesy.

655
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:41,879
Not so fast.

656
00:38:41,919 --> 00:38:43,011
But you know she's right.

657
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:44,715
The tree sap would
be perfect for...

658
00:38:44,755 --> 00:38:46,017
Just...

659
00:38:46,057 --> 00:38:47,524
stay with the ship.

660
00:38:52,396 --> 00:38:54,193
I already said thank you.

661
00:38:54,231 --> 00:38:56,563
That's what this is all about,
isn't it?

662
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,295
It's about repairing the ship.

663
00:38:58,402 --> 00:39:00,302
If I break something,
I fix it.

664
00:39:00,404 --> 00:39:02,065
Um, knife, please.

665
00:39:02,106 --> 00:39:05,974
Oh, yeah,
like I'd give you a weapon?

666
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:08,001
Thank you, Rat.

667
00:39:08,045 --> 00:39:10,240
You know, you really
ought to be

668
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:12,010
a little more courteous.

669
00:39:13,617 --> 00:39:14,879
Oh, great.

670
00:39:14,919 --> 00:39:16,682
Now I'm getting
etiquette lessons

671
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:18,313
from a bilge rat.

672
00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:20,289
Well, she did save
the ship, Captain.

673
00:39:20,324 --> 00:39:21,848
Why, thank you, Luca.

674
00:39:21,892 --> 00:39:23,792
And now she's helping to fix it.

675
00:39:23,828 --> 00:39:25,090
Very handy, I say.

676
00:39:25,129 --> 00:39:26,426
And brave!

677
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:29,433
This... girl wouldn't know how
to fix a broken fingernail!

678
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:31,332
Honestly, you are
the most boorish,

679
00:39:31,402 --> 00:39:34,530
pig-headed man
I've ever met.

680
00:39:34,572 --> 00:39:36,540
Hey, lady, I've seen
the highborn boys

681
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:38,508
your type hangs out with...

682
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:40,635
...and I'm the only man
you've ever met.

683
00:39:43,647 --> 00:39:45,342
Whoa.

684
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,353
Mmm.

685
00:39:51,155 --> 00:39:54,488
Oh, no. No. No.

686
00:39:54,525 --> 00:39:55,958
No...

687
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:59,722
Five on Marina.

688
00:40:00,965 --> 00:40:04,457
You... you...

689
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:06,197
egotistical...

690
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:07,761
- You spoiled...
- disrespectful,

691
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:09,636
- deluded,
- pretentious, pompous,

692
00:40:09,673 --> 00:40:12,107
- high-and-mighty...
- self-centered, untrustworthy,

693
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:15,044
ungrateful, impossible,
insufferable...

694
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,546
At least I'm not repressed!

695
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:17,774
Repressed?!

696
00:40:17,815 --> 00:40:19,646
I'll show you
repressed!

697
00:40:29,226 --> 00:40:30,318
What the...?

698
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:38,998
Put it back.

699
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:48,275
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Whoa, whoa...

700
00:40:48,312 --> 00:40:50,780
Ew...

701
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:54,249
Ew!

702
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:02,620
Run!

703
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:04,628
- It's a fish!
- It's a fish!

704
00:41:04,662 --> 00:41:06,721
Kale!

705
00:41:06,764 --> 00:41:08,026
Kale!

706
00:41:08,065 --> 00:41:09,692
Whoa!

707
00:41:21,245 --> 00:41:22,940
Jump!

708
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:31,280
Kale!

709
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:32,289
Got it!

710
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:41,158
Veer off, Kale!

711
00:41:41,198 --> 00:41:42,460
The star!

712
00:41:44,635 --> 00:41:45,863
Hold your heading!

713
00:41:45,903 --> 00:41:47,336
Rat, tie it off!

714
00:41:47,371 --> 00:41:48,998
Wha... wha...

715
00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:53,071
Ha-ha!

716
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:54,168
Wait!

717
00:42:08,726 --> 00:42:12,253
Yee-ha!

718
00:42:37,488 --> 00:42:38,819
Sinbad!

719
00:42:38,856 --> 00:42:40,949
The men can't take much more.

720
00:42:40,991 --> 00:42:42,618
I can't...

721
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:44,150
take much more, either.

722
00:42:44,194 --> 00:42:45,923
Cut the line!

723
00:43:00,377 --> 00:43:01,776
Oh, no, Spike!

724
00:43:01,812 --> 00:43:03,712
- Whoa, hold on, no...
- No, no, no, please...

725
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:06,739
Oh, Spike!

726
00:43:06,784 --> 00:43:09,776
Hey, where'd he get
the carrots?

727
00:43:14,191 --> 00:43:16,421
Whose idea was that again?

728
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:18,291
I don't know.

729
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:22,061
But he owes me lunch.

730
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:29,038
The Granite Gates.

731
00:43:29,073 --> 00:43:31,337
Bet you never thought
I'd get us this far.

732
00:43:31,375 --> 00:43:33,570
No, I didn't.

733
00:43:33,644 --> 00:43:35,874
But Proteus did.

734
00:43:35,913 --> 00:43:38,177
For some reason,
he trusts you.

735
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:43,246
Well, what could
he have been thinking?

736
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:45,755
How did you
two ever meet?

737
00:43:48,425 --> 00:43:49,983
Running for my
life, as usual.

738
00:43:50,027 --> 00:43:52,188
A couple of angry thugs
had cornered me

739
00:43:52,229 --> 00:43:53,753
outside the palace walls.

740
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:56,061
I was trapped.

741
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:57,692
A sword at my throat,

742
00:43:57,735 --> 00:43:59,464
at my chest, at my...

743
00:43:59,503 --> 00:44:03,132
Pickles and eggs!

744
00:44:04,708 --> 00:44:06,437
Well, you get the idea.

745
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:09,412
And then suddenly,
there was a fourth blade.

746
00:44:09,446 --> 00:44:10,606
It was Proteus.

747
00:44:10,714 --> 00:44:13,114
You see, he'd watched it all
from his room in the palace.

748
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:14,276
He actually climbed down

749
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:16,445
the castle wall
to fight at my side,

750
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:18,079
and, boy, did we fight.

751
00:44:18,122 --> 00:44:20,784
It was like we'd rehearsed it.

752
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:23,816
We were best friends
from that day forward.

753
00:44:23,861 --> 00:44:26,853
What happened with you two?

754
00:44:32,202 --> 00:44:34,534
What is it?

755
00:44:35,572 --> 00:44:38,564
We... took different paths.

756
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:52,314
Enough talking.

757
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:55,621
Time for some screaming.

758
00:45:13,777 --> 00:45:17,611
For crying out loud,
what next?

759
00:45:17,648 --> 00:45:19,343
Oh, get a shirt on

760
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:21,715
before you poke
someone's eye out.

761
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:26,321
Okay, guys, get down there
and break it up!

762
00:45:26,356 --> 00:45:28,051
We've got to keep moving!

763
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,094
Steal the Book of Peace.

764
00:45:34,631 --> 00:45:36,360
We will retire in the tropics.

765
00:46:08,999 --> 00:46:10,694
Everyone, back on the ship!

766
00:46:10,734 --> 00:46:11,928
Hurry!

767
00:46:11,969 --> 00:46:14,665
Come on! Come on! Move faster!

768
00:46:29,653 --> 00:46:30,517
Jed!

769
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:36,983
Grab the rope!

770
00:46:41,999 --> 00:46:43,330
Rat, your hand!

771
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:45,659
Marina!

772
00:47:37,621 --> 00:47:39,452
<i>Rat! Don't let</i>

773
00:47:39,489 --> 00:47:41,081
- the blocks freeze!
- Aye, aye, Captain.

774
00:47:41,124 --> 00:47:42,819
- And, Kale!
- Aye!

775
00:47:42,926 --> 00:47:44,689
Give me a hug?

776
00:47:44,728 --> 00:47:45,956
Excuse me?

777
00:47:48,065 --> 00:47:49,225
Hmph.

778
00:48:20,998 --> 00:48:23,796
Oh, she couldn't see the bird?

779
00:48:23,834 --> 00:48:26,359
Everyone else saw it.

780
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:30,138
It's as big as a freakin' ship.

781
00:48:30,173 --> 00:48:34,371
Marina?
Marina's looking the other way.

782
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:45,279
Shh, shh, shh.

783
00:48:47,691 --> 00:48:49,420
You're rescuing me!

784
00:48:49,459 --> 00:48:52,451
Yes, if that's what
you want to call it.

785
00:48:52,496 --> 00:48:54,987
But this is going
to cost you another diamond.

786
00:48:55,032 --> 00:48:58,524
Rescues aren't part
of the usual tourist package.

787
00:49:01,204 --> 00:49:02,535
So...

788
00:49:02,572 --> 00:49:04,096
how are we going
to get down?

789
00:49:04,141 --> 00:49:05,506
I... I don't know.

790
00:49:05,542 --> 00:49:07,737
- What?!
- I don't know yet.

791
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:09,609
I'm thinking about it,
all right?

792
00:49:09,646 --> 00:49:11,910
You scaled a thousand-
foot tower of ice,

793
00:49:11,982 --> 00:49:13,847
and you don't know
how to get down?

794
00:49:13,884 --> 00:49:15,476
Of all the ungrateful...

795
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:17,749
Look, if you'd rather
take your chances on your own,

796
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:18,914
that can be arranged.

797
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:20,513
Shh-shh-shh-shh.
All right.

798
00:49:20,557 --> 00:49:21,888
All right.

799
00:49:24,061 --> 00:49:25,392
So,

800
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:27,056
what do we have
to work with?

801
00:49:27,097 --> 00:49:28,564
Um... ropes?

802
00:49:28,598 --> 00:49:30,395
Uh... no.

803
00:49:30,434 --> 00:49:31,560
Uh, grappling hooks?

804
00:49:31,601 --> 00:49:33,159
Yeah... no.

805
00:49:33,203 --> 00:49:34,363
Your swords?

806
00:49:35,605 --> 00:49:37,368
Hey, I've got this.

807
00:49:37,407 --> 00:49:38,704
Oh, great.

808
00:49:38,742 --> 00:49:40,607
He can pick his teeth
when he's done with us.

809
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:41,770
Yeah.

810
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:43,746
Okay. See,
in the hands of an expert,

811
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:45,543
a good knife has 1,001 uses.

812
00:49:45,582 --> 00:49:47,607
Ooh!

813
00:49:51,588 --> 00:49:54,386
uh...

814
00:49:55,926 --> 00:49:57,325
Run!

815
00:50:00,864 --> 00:50:02,798
Come on! Faster!

816
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:07,496
W- Wait, wait. What?

817
00:50:07,537 --> 00:50:09,767
Let's go!

818
00:50:09,806 --> 00:50:12,775
No...!

819
00:50:14,077 --> 00:50:16,705
Oh! Oh!

820
00:50:24,621 --> 00:50:25,815
- Oh!
- Ah!

821
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:30,823
I think we lost him!

822
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:33,830
- I don't think so!
- Heads down!

823
00:50:36,299 --> 00:50:38,597
Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Whoa!

824
00:50:38,635 --> 00:50:40,933
Whoa!

825
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:48,469
Oh, no!

826
00:50:55,952 --> 00:50:56,850
Lean right!

827
00:51:06,797 --> 00:51:08,788
Whew.

828
00:51:08,832 --> 00:51:10,663
Come on!

829
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:26,076
Hang on!

830
00:51:40,063 --> 00:51:43,863
Yep, there they are.

831
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:53,834
There...

832
00:51:53,877 --> 00:51:56,072
Just as I... planned.

833
00:52:00,717 --> 00:52:02,742
It's Marina!

834
00:52:06,189 --> 00:52:10,319
We thought you
were gone forever!

835
00:52:11,495 --> 00:52:12,962
Oh, I'm fine. Really.

836
00:52:12,996 --> 00:52:15,396
But I'm touched by your concern.

837
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:33,980
Yee-ha!

838
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:09,480
Sinbad?

839
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:13,114
Thank you for coming after me.

840
00:53:13,156 --> 00:53:16,148
Well, y...

841
00:53:16,259 --> 00:53:18,124
you're welcome.

842
00:53:20,897 --> 00:53:23,263
This life suits you.

843
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:24,494
Yeah.

844
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:26,468
I wasn't made for dry land.

845
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:29,832
And you?

846
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:32,637
Is it the shore... or the sea?

847
00:53:34,277 --> 00:53:36,973
I've always loved the sea.

848
00:53:37,013 --> 00:53:40,744
I even dreamed
of a life on it.

849
00:53:40,784 --> 00:53:42,752
But it wasn't meant to be.

850
00:53:42,786 --> 00:53:46,119
I have responsibilities
in Syracuse.

851
00:53:46,156 --> 00:53:48,989
You really have to give it up?

852
00:53:50,293 --> 00:53:53,353
Yes.

853
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:21,622
You know, I've
traveled the world,

854
00:54:21,658 --> 00:54:24,388
seen things no other
man has seen...

855
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:26,622
but nothing...

856
00:54:26,663 --> 00:54:30,827
nothing compares
to the open sea.

857
00:54:30,867 --> 00:54:33,859
And is this what
you always wanted?

858
00:54:33,903 --> 00:54:36,337
Not really.

859
00:54:36,373 --> 00:54:38,068
When we were young,
Proteus and I

860
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:40,235
used to talk about
joining the Royal Navy

861
00:54:40,343 --> 00:54:43,244
and serving Syracuse
side by side.

862
00:54:43,346 --> 00:54:47,680
But as we got older,
our lives began to change.

863
00:54:47,717 --> 00:54:52,416
He's a prince,
and I'm... well.

864
00:54:54,758 --> 00:54:57,192
I was never jealous
of him, though...

865
00:54:57,227 --> 00:55:00,162
until one morning,
a ship came into harbor...

866
00:55:00,196 --> 00:55:04,155
a ship with his
future on it.

867
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:07,465
It was the most beautiful
thing I'd ever seen.

868
00:55:07,504 --> 00:55:10,234
What was on the ship?

869
00:55:13,209 --> 00:55:14,801
You.

870
00:55:15,879 --> 00:55:18,712
Proteus met you
at the dock.

871
00:55:18,748 --> 00:55:20,648
I jumped on the
first outbound ship

872
00:55:20,684 --> 00:55:22,584
and never looked back.

873
00:55:24,554 --> 00:55:26,545
Until now.

874
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:14,385
Rat! Give me a lookout!

875
00:56:21,837 --> 00:56:23,304
We're dead.

876
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:24,635
What is it?!

877
00:56:24,673 --> 00:56:26,368
I- I-It just ends, Captain!

878
00:56:26,408 --> 00:56:28,273
It's the edge of the world!

879
00:56:30,912 --> 00:56:32,846
Pay up. It's flat.

880
00:56:34,216 --> 00:56:36,184
Well, that's it.
Time to go home.

881
00:56:36,218 --> 00:56:37,185
Nuh-uh-uh.

882
00:56:37,219 --> 00:56:39,380
The captain hasn't
given his orders yet.

883
00:56:42,157 --> 00:56:44,785
Follow that star
beyond the horizon.

884
00:56:44,826 --> 00:56:47,556
Beyond the horizon.

885
00:56:56,338 --> 00:56:58,465
Sinbad?

886
00:56:58,507 --> 00:57:00,236
Men! All hands to your posts!

887
00:57:00,275 --> 00:57:02,436
Free all sheets!
Wait for my command!

888
00:57:02,477 --> 00:57:03,774
What?

889
00:57:03,812 --> 00:57:05,803
Now! Go! Go! Go!

890
00:57:05,847 --> 00:57:07,712
Eh, Sinbad, how-how are
we gonna pull this off?

891
00:57:07,749 --> 00:57:09,046
Just trust me.

892
00:57:09,084 --> 00:57:11,552
Rat! Rig the main yard
to the fors'le!

893
00:57:11,586 --> 00:57:13,076
But that would stop us dead!

894
00:57:13,121 --> 00:57:13,780
Just do it!

895
00:57:13,822 --> 00:57:15,380
Aye, aye, Captain.

896
00:57:18,226 --> 00:57:20,091
Whoa!

897
00:57:20,128 --> 00:57:21,561
Slack to all sheets!

898
00:57:21,596 --> 00:57:23,063
Aye, aye, Cap'n!

899
00:57:23,098 --> 00:57:24,258
Cut the fore and main trusses!

900
00:57:24,366 --> 00:57:26,960
Move! Move! Move!

901
00:57:27,002 --> 00:57:29,596
I got it. I got it. I got it.

902
00:57:29,638 --> 00:57:30,605
Aft yard astern!

903
00:57:30,639 --> 00:57:31,606
But that's...

904
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:32,971
Crazy, I know! Now hurry!

905
00:57:35,010 --> 00:57:35,772
Here, grab it!

906
00:57:35,811 --> 00:57:37,210
Go!

907
00:57:37,245 --> 00:57:38,439
Swing the fors'le to port!

908
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:41,278
Ease the aft!
Full hoist to forward sails!

909
00:57:41,383 --> 00:57:42,975
Aye, aye, Captain.

910
00:57:43,018 --> 00:57:44,007
Come on!

911
00:57:44,052 --> 00:57:45,280
Pull!

912
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:54,021
Tie off all sails!

913
00:57:54,062 --> 00:57:56,963
All hands amidships!

914
00:57:56,998 --> 00:57:58,625
And pray to the gods.

915
00:57:58,667 --> 00:58:01,192
We may be meeting them soon.

916
00:58:13,181 --> 00:58:15,342
We're going to die.

917
00:58:30,932 --> 00:58:32,991
Hold on! Grab the rope!

918
00:58:36,605 --> 00:58:38,664
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

919
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:01,094
It worked?

920
00:59:01,129 --> 00:59:02,756
Sinbad...

921
00:59:02,797 --> 00:59:04,094
...you did it.

922
00:59:17,379 --> 00:59:19,643
Grab hold!

923
00:59:19,681 --> 00:59:21,876
Grum, hard to port!

924
00:59:21,917 --> 00:59:23,817
Hard to port!

925
00:59:25,553 --> 00:59:26,884
- Kale!
- Aye!

926
00:59:26,922 --> 00:59:28,890
If I don't make it,
the ship is yours.

927
00:59:28,924 --> 00:59:30,619
No.

928
00:59:30,659 --> 00:59:32,388
Gentlemen, it's
been a privilege

929
00:59:32,494 --> 00:59:34,018
robbing with you.

930
00:59:36,398 --> 00:59:38,389
I'm coming with you.

931
00:59:38,466 --> 00:59:39,694
And don't tell me

932
00:59:39,734 --> 00:59:42,635
the Realm of Chaos is
no place for a woman.

933
00:59:44,472 --> 00:59:46,303
Hmm.

934
00:59:46,341 --> 00:59:48,673
I would never say that.

935
00:59:52,514 --> 00:59:54,709
Hey, sorry, boy.

936
00:59:54,749 --> 00:59:56,114
Not this time.

937
01:00:44,466 --> 01:00:45,728
Huh?

938
01:01:24,806 --> 01:01:26,296
- Huh?
- Huh?

939
01:01:36,184 --> 01:01:39,620
Now, now, my pets.

940
01:01:39,654 --> 01:01:44,284
Is this any way
to treat a guest?

941
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:55,529
Okay, I'm severely creeped out.

942
01:01:55,603 --> 01:01:58,037
Bravo.

943
01:01:58,073 --> 01:02:01,338
No mortal has ever made it
to Tartarus before.

944
01:02:02,710 --> 01:02:05,178
Alive, that is...

945
01:02:06,414 --> 01:02:07,403
Make yourself at home.

946
01:02:09,050 --> 01:02:10,449
Thank you. Uh...

947
01:02:10,485 --> 01:02:11,816
nice place you got here.

948
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:13,218
Like it?

949
01:02:13,254 --> 01:02:16,485
I'm planning on doing
the whole world this way.

950
01:02:18,159 --> 01:02:20,889
Wow, that's a good plan.

951
01:02:20,929 --> 01:02:23,762
Well, I see you're busy,
so listen, we'll just take

952
01:02:23,798 --> 01:02:25,925
the Book of Peace
and get of your way.

953
01:02:26,935 --> 01:02:28,562
What makes you think I have it?

954
01:02:28,670 --> 01:02:31,002
Uh, well, you framed me
for the theft,

955
01:02:31,039 --> 01:02:32,563
so they would execute me.

956
01:02:32,607 --> 01:02:33,869
You?

957
01:02:33,908 --> 01:02:34,897
Yeah.

958
01:02:37,412 --> 01:02:39,209
No.

959
01:02:39,247 --> 01:02:40,509
Proteus!

960
01:02:40,548 --> 01:02:42,573
You knew he would take my place.

961
01:02:43,985 --> 01:02:45,748
What a clever little man
you are.

962
01:02:45,787 --> 01:02:47,379
You thought I'd run.

963
01:02:47,422 --> 01:02:51,188
Then Proteus would die,
and Syracuse would be...

964
01:02:51,226 --> 01:02:53,592
Left without
the next rightful king,

965
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:57,688
and tumble into glorious chaos.

966
01:02:57,732 --> 01:03:01,099
You humans are so predictable.

967
01:03:01,136 --> 01:03:03,798
Proteus couldn't help
being ever so noble,

968
01:03:03,838 --> 01:03:06,136
and you couldn't help
betraying him.

969
01:03:06,174 --> 01:03:09,302
But I didn't betray Proteus!
I didn't run away.

970
01:03:09,344 --> 01:03:11,312
Oh, but you did betray him.

971
01:03:11,346 --> 01:03:13,871
You stole his only love.

972
01:03:13,915 --> 01:03:15,109
Look at her, Sinbad.

973
01:03:16,151 --> 01:03:18,551
He's not even
in his grave yet,

974
01:03:18,586 --> 01:03:21,180
and you're moving in
on his girl.

975
01:03:21,222 --> 01:03:26,626
Face it: Your heart
is as black as mine.

976
01:03:26,694 --> 01:03:28,457
You're wrong about him!

977
01:03:28,496 --> 01:03:29,793
He knows I'm not!

978
01:03:29,831 --> 01:03:31,264
You don't know
what's in his heart.

979
01:03:31,299 --> 01:03:32,994
Oh, yes, I do.

980
01:03:33,034 --> 01:03:35,969
And more importantly,
so does he.

981
01:03:36,004 --> 01:03:37,471
In your heart,
you know that

982
01:03:37,505 --> 01:03:39,405
Proteus is
going to die

983
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:41,840
because he saw
something in you

984
01:03:41,876 --> 01:03:43,935
that just isn't there.

985
01:03:43,978 --> 01:03:45,275
No.

986
01:03:45,313 --> 01:03:46,610
You want to bet?

987
01:03:46,648 --> 01:03:49,412
I'll tell you what.
Let's play a game.

988
01:03:49,450 --> 01:03:51,509
And if you win,
I'll give you

989
01:03:51,553 --> 01:03:52,918
the Book of Peace.

990
01:03:58,092 --> 01:04:00,185
There it is, noble hero.

991
01:04:01,896 --> 01:04:05,024
Not so fast.

992
01:04:05,066 --> 01:04:07,193
My game has rules,
Sinbad.

993
01:04:07,235 --> 01:04:09,203
I'll ask you a question.

994
01:04:09,237 --> 01:04:11,228
One simple question.

995
01:04:11,272 --> 01:04:14,833
If you answer truthfully,
the Book is yours.

996
01:04:14,876 --> 01:04:16,901
Give me your word.

997
01:04:16,945 --> 01:04:19,072
You still don't trust me?

998
01:04:19,113 --> 01:04:21,411
Uh... no.

999
01:04:21,449 --> 01:04:25,545
Isn't it a pity
we live in such skeptical times?

1000
01:04:25,587 --> 01:04:27,077
Oh, all right.

1001
01:04:27,121 --> 01:04:30,682
You have my word, as a goddess.

1002
01:04:32,227 --> 01:04:33,558
Fair enough?

1003
01:04:36,331 --> 01:04:38,265
Ask your question.

1004
01:04:38,299 --> 01:04:39,357
Excellent.

1005
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:41,630
Now, we all know what happens

1006
01:04:41,669 --> 01:04:43,899
if you get the Book of Peace.

1007
01:04:43,938 --> 01:04:47,203
You return it to Syracuse
and save Proteus.

1008
01:04:47,242 --> 01:04:49,472
But if you don't get the Book,

1009
01:04:49,510 --> 01:04:51,478
you have
a choice to make.

1010
01:04:51,512 --> 01:04:53,377
Either sail to paradise

1011
01:04:53,414 --> 01:04:55,143
with the woman
of your dreams,

1012
01:04:55,183 --> 01:04:58,880
or return to Syracuse to die.

1013
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:01,684
You're either a thief or a hero.

1014
01:05:01,723 --> 01:05:04,385
So, here's my question, Sinbad.

1015
01:05:04,425 --> 01:05:07,121
If you don't get the Book,

1016
01:05:07,161 --> 01:05:10,153
will you go back to die?

1017
01:05:23,678 --> 01:05:26,169
I will go back.

1018
01:05:36,624 --> 01:05:39,991
You're lying.

1019
01:06:22,603 --> 01:06:24,230
I'm sorry, Marina.

1020
01:06:24,272 --> 01:06:27,002
Eris is right about me.

1021
01:06:27,041 --> 01:06:29,373
No, she's not.
You answered her question.

1022
01:06:29,410 --> 01:06:30,536
You told the truth.

1023
01:06:30,578 --> 01:06:33,240
It wasn't the truth.

1024
01:06:33,281 --> 01:06:36,648
It was me trying to pass
myself off as someone I'm not.

1025
01:06:36,684 --> 01:06:38,481
Sinbad,
I've seen who you are!

1026
01:06:38,519 --> 01:06:40,146
You don't need to pretend!

1027
01:06:40,188 --> 01:06:41,416
Eris trapped you!

1028
01:06:41,456 --> 01:06:45,085
Why should you or Proteus
or anyone have to die?!

1029
01:06:45,126 --> 01:06:45,820
Marina...

1030
01:06:45,860 --> 01:06:47,919
No! You need to escape.

1031
01:06:47,962 --> 01:06:50,192
Get as far away as you can.

1032
01:06:50,231 --> 01:06:52,290
I'll go back.
I'll explain everything.

1033
01:06:52,333 --> 01:06:53,197
No, Marina.

1034
01:06:54,769 --> 01:06:58,830
I can't watch you die!

1035
01:06:58,906 --> 01:07:02,000
I love you.

1036
01:07:27,335 --> 01:07:31,431
But could you love a man
who would run away?

1037
01:08:38,172 --> 01:08:40,936
I bet you thought
I wouldn't make it.

1038
01:08:41,976 --> 01:08:43,466
I was...

1039
01:08:43,511 --> 01:08:46,207
...beginning to wonder.

1040
01:08:50,852 --> 01:08:51,944
The Book?

1041
01:08:51,986 --> 01:08:55,285
I did my best.

1042
01:08:55,323 --> 01:08:57,223
It wasn't enough.

1043
01:08:58,426 --> 01:09:01,793
No.

1044
01:09:01,829 --> 01:09:04,059
You came back anyway.

1045
01:09:04,098 --> 01:09:09,331
How could I do anything else...
my friend?

1046
01:10:20,575 --> 01:10:21,667
Get back!

1047
01:10:37,425 --> 01:10:40,292
How dare you?!

1048
01:10:40,328 --> 01:10:44,196
Everything
was going perfectly,

1049
01:10:44,231 --> 01:10:47,064
and now you do this!

1050
01:10:49,637 --> 01:10:53,903
Eris, I don't understand.

1051
01:10:53,941 --> 01:10:56,068
Don't play coy with me.

1052
01:10:56,177 --> 01:10:59,806
Maybe you can fool these people,

1053
01:10:59,847 --> 01:11:01,610
but I know who you are.

1054
01:11:01,649 --> 01:11:05,881
You're a selfish,
unprincipled liar!

1055
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:07,547
Wait a minute.

1056
01:11:07,588 --> 01:11:09,613
I didn't lie.

1057
01:11:09,657 --> 01:11:11,318
I came back.

1058
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:12,758
That's why you're here.

1059
01:11:12,793 --> 01:11:14,920
This was all part
of your test.

1060
01:11:14,962 --> 01:11:16,190
I told the truth.

1061
01:11:16,230 --> 01:11:17,925
And wasn't there something

1062
01:11:17,965 --> 01:11:20,331
about being
"bound for all eternity"?

1063
01:11:42,390 --> 01:11:45,120
Well, well, well.

1064
01:11:45,159 --> 01:11:48,060
This has got to be a little
embarrassing for you, Eris.

1065
01:11:49,196 --> 01:11:51,630
Don't push your luck, Sinbad.

1066
01:11:51,666 --> 01:11:55,534
You're cute,
but not that cute.

1067
01:11:57,204 --> 01:12:00,640
And lucky for you,
I've got places to go,

1068
01:12:00,675 --> 01:12:05,408
things to destroy,
stuff to steal.

1069
01:12:05,446 --> 01:12:06,970
Ta.

1070
01:12:57,531 --> 01:12:59,761
You know,
for what it's worth,

1071
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:02,667
I think the council
believes you now.

1072
01:13:05,706 --> 01:13:08,402
You think?

1073
01:13:15,249 --> 01:13:17,649
King Dymas.

1074
01:13:17,685 --> 01:13:19,152
Uh, whoa, hey.

1075
01:13:19,186 --> 01:13:20,414
How much you got on you?

1076
01:13:20,454 --> 01:13:24,618
I offer you the gratitude
of the Twelve Cities,

1077
01:13:24,658 --> 01:13:27,593
and the apology of a king.

1078
01:13:28,596 --> 01:13:30,063
No, really. How much?

1079
01:13:30,097 --> 01:13:32,224
Sinbad.

1080
01:13:38,873 --> 01:13:39,931
Come on.

1081
01:13:39,974 --> 01:13:41,942
This is going to be
a heck of a party.

1082
01:13:41,976 --> 01:13:44,570
Everyone's going to want
to hear about the voyage.

1083
01:13:44,612 --> 01:13:46,239
Fair winds, calm seas.

1084
01:13:46,347 --> 01:13:48,474
Nothing much to tell.

1085
01:13:50,117 --> 01:13:51,175
What's the matter?

1086
01:13:51,218 --> 01:13:53,448
No fun if you're
actually invited?

1087
01:13:58,559 --> 01:14:00,652
No, it's just, uh...

1088
01:14:00,694 --> 01:14:03,185
there's a hammock in Fiji
with my name on it.

1089
01:14:09,003 --> 01:14:11,733
Good sailing, Sinbad.

1090
01:14:13,174 --> 01:14:14,573
Get a haircut.

1091
01:14:14,608 --> 01:14:17,372
You're going to be king someday.

1092
01:14:53,247 --> 01:14:54,578
Just another

1093
01:14:54,615 --> 01:14:56,913
uneventful day in Syracuse.

1094
01:15:02,756 --> 01:15:05,657
You know, I stood here
with a woman once.

1095
01:15:05,693 --> 01:15:07,627
She looked over the ocean

1096
01:15:07,661 --> 01:15:10,323
and wished she could sail
beyond the horizon.

1097
01:15:10,364 --> 01:15:13,800
She saw... such wonder.

1098
01:15:13,834 --> 01:15:17,668
And what happened
to this woman?

1099
01:15:17,705 --> 01:15:19,764
She got her chance.

1100
01:15:19,807 --> 01:15:24,267
She sailed the seas,
and she fell in love.

1101
01:15:28,415 --> 01:15:29,575
Proteus, I...

1102
01:15:29,617 --> 01:15:33,348
Marina, follow your heart.

1103
01:15:33,454 --> 01:15:36,252
Mine is here in Syracuse.

1104
01:15:36,290 --> 01:15:37,882
Yours...

1105
01:15:37,925 --> 01:15:42,123
yours is sailing
with the next tide.

1106
01:15:45,733 --> 01:15:47,724
Oh, Proteus.

1107
01:16:04,752 --> 01:16:06,913
Captain?

1108
01:16:06,954 --> 01:16:08,148
Hmm?

1109
01:16:08,188 --> 01:16:10,247
We're ready to sail.

1110
01:16:10,291 --> 01:16:12,384
All right, Kale.

1111
01:16:12,459 --> 01:16:14,620
Take us out.

1112
01:16:14,662 --> 01:16:16,129
Aye, aye, Captain.

1113
01:16:16,163 --> 01:16:17,755
Cast off!

1114
01:16:40,688 --> 01:16:42,212
Oh... Rat!

1115
01:16:42,256 --> 01:16:43,245
What?

1116
01:16:46,460 --> 01:16:48,587
Excuse me, Captain.

1117
01:16:48,629 --> 01:16:51,427
You need to replace
these rig joints pretty soon.

1118
01:16:51,498 --> 01:16:53,466
The mizzen ropes
need the support.

1119
01:16:55,536 --> 01:16:58,596
These joints
were from the Jasmine Sea.

1120
01:16:58,639 --> 01:17:00,971
That's halfway around the world.

1121
01:17:01,008 --> 01:17:03,135
Then we'd better get started.

1122
01:17:08,248 --> 01:17:09,442
Well, you know,

1123
01:17:09,516 --> 01:17:11,347
that means going through
the Hydra's lair.

1124
01:17:11,385 --> 01:17:13,250
- Mm-hmm.
- The Minotaur's haven.

1125
01:17:13,287 --> 01:17:14,447
- Mm-hmm.
- The Cyclops' den.

1126
01:17:14,521 --> 01:17:16,113
- Mm-hmm.
- Under the Swansea Bridge.

1127
01:17:16,156 --> 01:17:18,124
- Mm-hmm.
- Through the China Seas.

1128
01:17:18,158 --> 01:17:19,955
That's a very long voyage.

1129
01:17:19,994 --> 01:17:24,397
And it's very, very dangerous.

1130
01:17:24,431 --> 01:17:25,728
Don't worry.

1131
01:17:25,766 --> 01:17:28,064
I'll protect you.

1132
01:17:44,485 --> 01:17:45,816
Oh, Spike.

1133
01:17:45,853 --> 01:17:47,650
Spike.

1134
01:17:47,688 --> 01:17:50,452
Spike... down.
