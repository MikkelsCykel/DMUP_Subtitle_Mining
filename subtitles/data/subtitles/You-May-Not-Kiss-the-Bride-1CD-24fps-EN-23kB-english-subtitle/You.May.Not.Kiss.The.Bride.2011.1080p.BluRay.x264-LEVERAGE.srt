3
00:02:09,532 --> 00:02:11,615
- You two looks amazing!
- Like a perfect couple.

4
00:02:12,761 --> 00:02:15,380
C'mon you guys! This is
the wedding day. Smile!

5
00:02:17,945 --> 00:02:19,438
This is not working.

6
00:02:21,654 --> 00:02:25,813
Mr. Pig! Mr. Piggy! C'mon!
Everyone likes Mr. Piggy.

7
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:27,735
Up here!

8
00:02:27,862 --> 00:02:33,941
What are you doing, Tony?
They have to kiss passionately.

9
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:37,317
Out of the picture, Tony.

10
00:02:37,446 --> 00:02:39,566
And start.

11
00:02:39,696 --> 00:02:44,981
How long have they been dating?
After all, it must be informed by seven.

12
00:02:45,112 --> 00:02:49,521
I'm trying to figure out how long
should mingle before the wedding.

13
00:02:49,654 --> 00:02:51,858
Right.

14
00:02:51,987 --> 00:02:54,025
Give it here.

15
00:02:56,279 --> 00:02:59,692
Please help a little bit, guys.
Sit down properly.

16
00:03:03,487 --> 00:03:05,561
Tonya.

17
00:03:07,571 --> 00:03:09,692
What are you doing? Sorry.

18
00:03:09,821 --> 00:03:11,693
Stop Dancing.

19
00:03:11,821 --> 00:03:16,194
♫ Singing... ♫

20
00:03:27,404 --> 00:03:30,438
I like the espresso very much.

21
00:03:32,613 --> 00:03:35,776
It is a strong and enjoyable hair.

22
00:03:36,863 --> 00:03:41,603
I see that you, Agent Ross
you consider the usual coffee...

23
00:03:41,738 --> 00:03:47,153
keep but Meyers
latte and a lot more of the sweet.

24
00:03:47,279 --> 00:03:50,526
For this reason, I became a
citizen of the United States.

25
00:03:50,655 --> 00:03:54,399
America is an alternative country.

26
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:57,362
The Croatian coffee tastes like
dog..

27
00:03:57,488 --> 00:04:01,233
Why exactly did you want to
meet with us, Mr. Nikitin?

28
00:04:01,363 --> 00:04:03,304
You and your wife already
have foreign citizenship.

29
00:04:03,465 --> 00:04:05,782
I don't know anything we can help you with

30
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:10,568
I want my daughter Masha to receive
the same without downtime.

31
00:04:10,696 --> 00:04:16,314
What do you suggest?
Liver like that.

32
00:04:16,988 --> 00:04:23,234
I understand that this service
usually costs $ 10,000.

33
00:04:26,113 --> 00:04:31,351
Whatever your opinion
it is to overtake the immigration laws...

34
00:04:31,488 --> 00:04:35,612
we usually do not have to speed up the
any civil applications.

35
00:04:35,738 --> 00:04:41,319
We could even arrest you.
We keep an eye on your daughter.

36
00:04:46,113 --> 00:04:52,193
You said that they could buy. Rumor has it that.
I'm looking for someone else.

37
00:04:52,322 --> 00:04:57,442
My daughter is now regarded as an eye.
We have to find another way.

38
00:05:08,447 --> 00:05:14,314
The sooner this is done, the sooner you
looting.

39
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:18,441
It will only pick on you.
Give me a kiss.

40
00:05:20,739 --> 00:05:23,902
PLEASE.
Rapsuta between the hind legs, and poses...

41
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:28,154
Between the rear legs?
Tickle is normal.

42
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:32,356
I'm not a tickler type..
You have your dog, you can tickle.

43
00:05:32,489 --> 00:05:36,317
Advertisement promised satisfaction.
By the way I do not pay.

44
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:41,396
Right.

45
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:45,192
I can I tickle your dog.
Generally make the first dinner.

46
00:05:46,322 --> 00:05:48,858
That's it.

47
00:05:50,697 --> 00:05:52,688
I'm sorry I'm late.

48
00:05:54,156 --> 00:05:59,690
Hierotko dog's bundle of joy?
By the way, it does not cooperate.

49
00:05:59,822 --> 00:06:04,775
That's the next customer.
Show costumes, but do not bring in here.

50
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:07,987
Understood.

51
00:06:09,864 --> 00:06:11,522
Hjei.

52
00:06:11,656 --> 00:06:17,155
Tjoin kjissan kjuvattavaksi.

53
00:06:17,281 --> 00:06:21,061
I like the accents.
It seems to be a Venezuelan?

54
00:06:23,072 --> 00:06:26,652
All right! It should be rerub.

55
00:06:26,781 --> 00:06:30,691
It growled all the time.
Like a pirate. Meilaan images.

56
00:06:30,822 --> 00:06:35,563
Ballerina or an angel?
I said that the cat may be imported!

57
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:39,189
Kjissi!

58
00:06:42,573 --> 00:06:44,149
Brutus.

59
00:06:44,281 --> 00:06:47,196
Here, Brutus.

60
00:06:57,614 --> 00:07:01,987
- Stop, kjissimirri!
- Brutus!

61
00:07:09,114 --> 00:07:11,271
Staff only

62
00:07:22,656 --> 00:07:27,065
I have to go,
I am late model or part thereof.

63
00:07:27,198 --> 00:07:32,318
I'm sorry the whole hassle.
It's okay, accidents do happen.

64
00:07:37,781 --> 00:07:43,979
Why are not you already asked me out?
I have been assistant month.

65
00:07:46,031 --> 00:07:49,314
Oh, and you've been...

66
00:07:49,448 --> 00:07:53,821
Very creative relationship squeaky toys.
You are talented.

67
00:07:53,948 --> 00:07:56,615
I not feel attractive?

68
00:07:57,698 --> 00:08:02,071
You are, but not a good idea...
I feel

69
00:08:03,157 --> 00:08:06,937
that is a strong connection between us.

70
00:08:08,032 --> 00:08:13,945
If I moved to you,
I never miss his work.

71
00:08:14,073 --> 00:08:18,149
However, the alarm clock function.

72
00:08:22,615 --> 00:08:25,447
Think about it.

73
00:08:27,698 --> 00:08:28,978
Right.

74
00:08:40,532 --> 00:08:42,274
<i>Display language.</i>

75
00:08:43,907 --> 00:08:46,940
You suffer from stress.
You have no idea.

76
00:08:47,074 --> 00:08:50,818
Chi is not in balance. All it takes is
.

77
00:08:51,907 --> 00:08:55,438
This is my first time.
Does it hurt?

78
00:08:55,574 --> 00:09:00,196
No pain. Close your eyes. Relax.

79
00:09:07,449 --> 00:09:10,779
Do not seem too bad.

80
00:09:19,532 --> 00:09:22,862
You look stressed out.
Do you need help?

81
00:09:29,699 --> 00:09:32,697
Do you like borscht?
Family Recipe.

82
00:09:37,241 --> 00:09:41,400
I am Vlatko Nikitin.
Brick Land and Oleg are alaisiani.

83
00:09:41,532 --> 00:09:43,404
Call me Brickiksi.

84
00:09:43,532 --> 00:09:46,863
What do you want? This is an interception.

85
00:09:46,991 --> 00:09:51,399
After all. You came here
voluntarily to indemnify.

86
00:09:51,532 --> 00:09:56,486
Compensate? I did not do anything.
Tell me it is my wife's cat.

87
00:09:56,616 --> 00:09:59,649
I'm sorry. The new assistant...

88
00:09:59,782 --> 00:10:06,941
Cat is worthless. Dubrovnik
at a cost of 3 kuna. So, 54 cents.

89
00:10:07,074 --> 00:10:11,613
Auricular veterinary fees.
It's just a cat.

90
00:10:11,741 --> 00:10:17,026
I prefer the goats. But my wife
Boris The stage is sad.

91
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:22,988
You should be aware, Mr. Nik... Nicotine.
How can I compensate for this?

92
00:10:23,116 --> 00:10:29,480
The easiest way is to let boys treat
cement shoes and a swimming trip.

93
00:10:33,908 --> 00:10:35,945
Aha! Oh...

94
00:10:37,033 --> 00:10:41,820
What is the second easiest?
Marry my daughter, Masha.

95
00:10:44,575 --> 00:10:49,149
I'm sorry?
Mashalla a visa problem.

96
00:10:49,283 --> 00:10:52,400
Should we get married,
in order to receive a residence permit?

97
00:10:52,533 --> 00:10:57,320
Year after the federal repeal of
, and our accounts are clear.

98
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:02,687
I have not even met him.
It's just a sham marriage.

99
00:11:02,825 --> 00:11:07,316
Masha women after Bricklandin.
Brick Land is like my own son...

100
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:10,448
but very jealous.

101
00:11:10,575 --> 00:11:14,615
I would not recommend
any sexual activity...

102
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:18,687
Or he will kill you
very unpleasant way.

103
00:11:18,825 --> 00:11:24,692
I'm sorry, but the debate is over.
I am sorry for the cat, but...

104
00:11:25,617 --> 00:11:28,105
You do not know who I am.

105
00:11:28,242 --> 00:11:31,856
Many influential men have
been trying to deceive me.

106
00:11:31,992 --> 00:11:34,943
And where are they now?
Who knows?

107
00:11:35,075 --> 00:11:38,108
You're not a man of consequence.

108
00:11:39,033 --> 00:11:43,572
You're smart.
Yes You make the right decision.

109
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:48,404
Let us live forever.

110
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,525
Who the hell is this?

111
00:12:29,659 --> 00:12:32,859
I, the mother.
You better be in trouble,

112
00:12:32,992 --> 00:12:37,614
when you call at this time.
I have a mask on the face!

113
00:12:37,742 --> 00:12:41,072
I have to marry a Croatian girl, or I die.

114
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,531
<i>Then go get married.
Did not you hear?</i>

115
00:12:44,659 --> 00:12:51,485
This is good news.
Her father would kill me.

116
00:12:51,617 --> 00:12:55,397
Do you love him?
I've never met him.

117
00:12:55,534 --> 00:12:59,859
The story is complex.
The same old hymn every time.

118
00:12:59,992 --> 00:13:04,945
Is he old enough to become a mother?
Eastern Europeans are fertile.

119
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:09,069
This is not helping matters.
How did he look like?

120
00:13:09,201 --> 00:13:12,566
<i>I do not know, but
his mother does not bode well.</i>

121
00:13:12,701 --> 00:13:17,109
Of all the ugly, it's just a matter of time
. Is he rich?

122
00:13:17,242 --> 00:13:21,283
His father is a crime boss.
So the money is enough.

123
00:13:21,409 --> 00:13:25,865
Are you even listening?
Do you have other women?

124
00:13:25,993 --> 00:13:29,193
I do not have time to wait for
grandchildren!

125
00:13:29,326 --> 00:13:34,659
Forget it, I do not touch him.
Your father is kind of listened to.

126
00:13:34,784 --> 00:13:37,782
You will be conceived for
honeymooners in the elevator.

127
00:13:37,909 --> 00:13:41,903
I had the elevator button after-
on my forehead for two days.

128
00:13:42,034 --> 00:13:48,114
That would not have needed to hear.
The men are afraid of commitment.

129
00:13:48,243 --> 00:13:50,233
Marry him, else I will not say.

130
00:13:52,368 --> 00:13:56,029
Do you like the machine?
I got it for half the price.

131
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:00,319
You made the sleek shops.
Yes, something at least flowed.

132
00:14:01,784 --> 00:14:06,323
The wedding is two weeks from now.
Brick Land wants to be the best man.

133
00:14:07,743 --> 00:14:10,066
Touching.

134
00:14:10,201 --> 00:14:14,740
Give this Mashalle.
It will convince the authorities.

135
00:14:14,868 --> 00:14:18,731
Do you want to call witnesses?
I do not.

136
00:14:18,868 --> 00:14:23,360
I am an only child.
Father is gone and the mother is...

137
00:14:23,493 --> 00:14:25,199
Busy.

138
00:14:25,326 --> 00:14:29,616
Okay, meeting's over. Check-out.

139
00:14:41,701 --> 00:14:45,233
What do you mean you're
going to get married?

140
00:14:45,368 --> 00:14:47,939
I will get married.

141
00:14:48,076 --> 00:14:53,658
How long have you married him?
How long? How long?

142
00:14:55,077 --> 00:14:58,110
We have not yet had sex.

143
00:14:58,243 --> 00:15:01,360
Why? Is he or virgin?

144
00:15:01,493 --> 00:15:06,281
- Is he sexy?
- He is a Croat.

145
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:09,776
Does she speak English?
Let's hope.

146
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:13,192
Tilasitko him to Ebay?
I do not.

147
00:15:13,327 --> 00:15:18,316
Why then did not identify him?
The situation is complex.

148
00:15:25,202 --> 00:15:28,484
I'm not stupid, Bryan.

149
00:15:28,618 --> 00:15:32,826
If you want to leave, you do not need
to come up with kruusialaista virgins.

150
00:15:32,952 --> 00:15:36,780
Croatian Constitution.
I do not invent him.

151
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:40,323
<i>I have never been.
I  am the deceased!</i>

152
00:15:40,452 --> 00:15:43,023
But we are not even seeing anybody.

153
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:47,201
You can leave me, if you want.
Why would I do it?

154
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:52,441
- I love you.
- Look here, Tony.

155
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:55,658
You think I understand
the relationship abuse.

156
00:15:55,785 --> 00:16:02,398
I do not know many at all this,
but I know the men. You want me to.

157
00:16:02,535 --> 00:16:07,442
, Unfortunately, I do not want to.
I will get married.

158
00:16:08,827 --> 00:16:11,067
After all, it is seen.

159
00:16:12,869 --> 00:16:15,820
What's over there talking about?

160
00:16:15,952 --> 00:16:18,820
Let's go through it one more time.

161
00:16:18,952 --> 00:16:22,199
We met ballet presentation.

162
00:16:22,327 --> 00:16:26,368
It was "Gazelle".
"Giselle" Joffrey Ballet!

163
00:16:26,494 --> 00:16:28,899
Is it to be the ballet?

164
00:16:29,994 --> 00:16:32,613
Masha loves to dance!

165
00:16:32,744 --> 00:16:36,441
Exactly the same. We went to the ballet,
we started to pick out...

166
00:16:36,577 --> 00:16:40,618
Where Kosit him?
Ukraine a comparable bistro.

167
00:16:40,744 --> 00:16:44,192
Ukraine a comparable tavern.
Favorite drink?

168
00:16:44,327 --> 00:16:47,444
I know this . Stav... Do not say that.

169
00:16:47,577 --> 00:16:49,983
<i>Stavlenniy myod.</i>

170
00:16:50,119 --> 00:16:53,567
- Favorite color?
- Blue.

171
00:16:53,703 --> 00:16:56,654
Red! It is the final answer.

172
00:16:56,786 --> 00:16:59,570
What he hates the most?

173
00:16:59,703 --> 00:17:02,108
Big British villains.

174
00:17:02,244 --> 00:17:08,075
Game Men! He hates them. Play with
the calculator, it was a bad joke.

175
00:17:08,203 --> 00:17:12,825
Listen to me.
You will meet Masha's nightclub.

176
00:17:12,953 --> 00:17:19,316
Present knew well.
Lost but if too far, the crusher you!

177
00:17:19,453 --> 00:17:22,949
Right. Thank you for
your encouragement, sir.

178
00:17:25,786 --> 00:17:29,650
Would help the issue, if I
knew what he looks like.

179
00:17:31,911 --> 00:17:35,822
In my eyes he is
the world's most beautiful woman.

180
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:55,444
Hi, I'm Bryan.
Brick told me about you a lot.

181
00:17:56,245 --> 00:18:01,068
Zoya.
Zoya? Do not you not Masha?

182
00:18:01,203 --> 00:18:04,236
- Zoya.
- Awesome!

183
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,490
Masha...

184
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:23,026
Bryan?

185
00:18:24,953 --> 00:18:27,157
Masha?

186
00:18:29,078 --> 00:18:33,487
Ohjaatko us to the table, Anya?
Okay.

187
00:18:34,453 --> 00:18:36,243
Come on.

188
00:18:46,745 --> 00:18:48,652
Thank you.

189
00:18:52,453 --> 00:18:55,985
That's the embarrassment.
Exactly.

190
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:59,651
I did not know what you look like.

191
00:18:59,787 --> 00:19:04,279
You seem disappointed.
I'm not. English is perfect.

192
00:19:04,412 --> 00:19:06,900
Nanny was an American.

193
00:19:07,037 --> 00:19:10,485
You look just like I thought.

194
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:14,199
I went to see your Facebook profile.

195
00:19:14,329 --> 00:19:20,657
It was hen. Cowboy Boots
had a friend, and we are not together.

196
00:19:21,787 --> 00:19:25,484
You're only here because of the cat.
I am sorry.

197
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:30,858
It's all right. No offense, but
I do not want to get married.

198
00:19:30,995 --> 00:19:34,824
I know that you are a photographer
and your eyes are hazel...

199
00:19:34,954 --> 00:19:37,822
But it's not a good enough reason.

200
00:19:39,829 --> 00:19:43,988
I think it would become a citizen
legally in less than years from now...

201
00:19:44,121 --> 00:19:47,901
but that was before the father tried to
bribe the immigration authorities to.

202
00:19:48,037 --> 00:19:51,699
I told him to stay away
from the matter, but...

203
00:19:54,371 --> 00:19:59,656
There are two men, who
are watching us.

204
00:20:01,871 --> 00:20:05,071
Behave normally.

205
00:20:11,496 --> 00:20:13,403
What do we do now?

206
00:20:13,537 --> 00:20:16,903
Allow them to watch.

207
00:20:28,371 --> 00:20:31,653
I do not, then nothing Barysnikov.

208
00:20:31,788 --> 00:20:35,200
- Just relax.
- Okay.

209
00:20:39,413 --> 00:20:42,909
Oh, all right.

210
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:46,486
No, no.
Is not it good business?

211
00:20:46,621 --> 00:20:50,780
- Follow me.
- Okay.

212
00:20:50,913 --> 00:20:54,658
Follow a slow rhythm.

213
00:21:01,663 --> 00:21:05,111
They noticed us? Just be sure.

214
00:21:13,246 --> 00:21:16,493
They are skilled to leave. Who?

215
00:21:16,621 --> 00:21:19,323
The immigration officers.

216
00:21:19,455 --> 00:21:23,780
So, all right.
Better, however, to be sure.

217
00:21:33,246 --> 00:21:36,328
The route is clear, is seen at a wedding.

218
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:52,739
Mr. Lighthouse, we have
Ross Meyers and immigration.

219
00:21:52,872 --> 00:21:56,817
Do you plan to get married
Masha Nikitin with?

220
00:21:56,955 --> 00:21:59,704
Yes I will.

221
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:05,032
We are seeing anybody couple of months.
She hates men in the game.

222
00:22:07,247 --> 00:22:11,406
Where did you meet?
Joffrey Ballet.

223
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:15,402
"The Nutcracker" was in the software.
There when "Gazelle" ie "Giselle".

224
00:22:15,538 --> 00:22:19,995
Three ballet one.
You too So do ballet.

225
00:22:20,122 --> 00:22:27,078
I do not. I got a free ticket and I
thought that maybe I would meet Croatian.

226
00:22:27,205 --> 00:22:29,409
And this was the case.

227
00:22:29,539 --> 00:22:32,702
What is this about?

228
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:38,032
You know, yes. Masha's visa will expire on
and the wedding of the authorization.

229
00:22:38,164 --> 00:22:41,660
Was his father
money to a girl married to?

230
00:22:41,789 --> 00:22:47,572
Give us a break... Nikitin is a
crime against the world's bosses.

231
00:22:47,705 --> 00:22:52,612
Alleged extortion and murder.
Do you want her vävykseen?

232
00:22:52,747 --> 00:22:58,495
How much did he have to shell out?
No, I swear.

233
00:22:58,622 --> 00:23:04,240
But he will pay an expensive
honeymoon in the South Sea.

234
00:23:05,914 --> 00:23:12,526
Do not you know his honeymoon?
My Nikon? Of course, I know.

235
00:23:12,664 --> 00:23:15,781
I just do not know
that he will pay for everything.

236
00:23:15,914 --> 00:23:19,161
Pila Then to his surprise.

237
00:23:19,289 --> 00:23:22,619
End up in prison, while if you are lying.

238
00:23:22,747 --> 00:23:26,279
Or you will die.
He ​​does not let you find out alive.

239
00:23:26,414 --> 00:23:33,288
If you have been forced into, you will get a
immunity from prosecution. So help against.

240
00:23:35,206 --> 00:23:38,571
What you long for assistance?
Explain the Nikitin transactions.

241
00:23:38,706 --> 00:23:41,076
Bank accounts, money laundering, all.

242
00:23:44,956 --> 00:23:50,193
I'm sorry, but I am not under pressure to
. I love Mashaa.

243
00:23:52,373 --> 00:23:58,487
Right. But think about it.

244
00:24:01,123 --> 00:24:04,986
Okay,
but I do not have to hide.

245
00:24:10,789 --> 00:24:13,195
What are you doing here?

246
00:24:14,289 --> 00:24:19,445
I'm looking for catnip. Is there?
I do not have catnip.

247
00:24:19,581 --> 00:24:24,285
You look great... In a way.
But you have to leave.

248
00:24:24,415 --> 00:24:27,862
Put me positions and shoot me if you want.

249
00:24:32,748 --> 00:24:35,995
You have got to go, Tony.

250
00:24:40,081 --> 00:24:45,415
If you care about me, forget me.
I do not give it up easily.

251
00:25:02,123 --> 00:25:07,325
<i>Welcome! I want to raise the cup's
satisfaction substances.  Za mladenci!</i>

257

<i>Who is  gorko?

Bride be kiss
until it is fresh. Slavic tradition.

266
00:26:38,082 --> 00:26:40,618
After all, I follow the tradition.

267
00:26:53,749 --> 00:26:58,371
Take it easy. Make him what you want, when
citizenship is acquired.

268
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:09,408
I love this woman!

269
00:27:11,541 --> 00:27:14,788
I want to toast the groom.

270
00:27:15,958 --> 00:27:20,698

274
00:27:31,374 --> 00:27:33,993
It seems that
he has a girl in hand is worth two.

275
00:27:34,124 --> 00:27:39,161
Cover it.
I'm getting Mr. Pig's whining.

276

Not! I do not give up you!

278
00:27:45,041 --> 00:27:49,829
Sorry about that.
He ​​is a former assistant.

279
00:27:49,958 --> 00:27:56,914
He's crazy. He believes that there
is a ratio of, but it's not true.

280
00:27:57,041 --> 00:28:01,782
I've loved only one woman in
my mother's in addition to...

281
00:28:01,916 --> 00:28:06,124
and today I was lucky enough to

Credibly represent and warrant
that you love my daughter.

284
00:28:23,041 --> 00:28:28,244
I have no choice.
My wife is a good human expert.

285
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:33,079
He sees what he sees,
even when you're blind to it.

286
00:28:33,833 --> 00:28:37,495
I do not love Mashaa.
Honeymoon not occur no.

287
00:28:37,625 --> 00:28:42,163
Why then do we leave?
The state should not doubt.

00:28:42,292 --> 00:28:45,740
The subject is far away.
Ehkeivät as they are.

understand the situation.

291
00:28:57,708 --> 00:29:01,572
Do not worry,
I'm not interested in him.

292
00:29:24,959 --> 00:29:28,999
"What did he say?
'Take care of Mashastamme"

293
00:29:29,125 --> 00:29:32,538
" or else you suffer more
than you can imagine."

294
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:37,446
It is believed in him as saying.

295
00:29:49,042 --> 00:29:53,118
You were silent during the entire flight.
You were gone out of the flight.

296

Can we talk about this?
What? We present our continent.

297
00:29:58,459 --> 00:30:03,282
We spend a lot of time together.

00:31:12,543 --> 00:31:16,453
Should we try?
Is it safe for sure?

313
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:21,539
I have never lost a passenger.

314
00:31:31,793 --> 00:31:37,031
" On the left you will see
the island of Hiva oan."

315
00:31:38,126 --> 00:31:40,828
"This is the second largest
Marquesassaarten ."

316
00:31:43,251 --> 00:31:48,074
"How much farther is it?
'Beautiful island of Bora Bora"

317
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:52,784
" will be displayed shortly on the right,
it belongs to Society Islands."

318
00:31:52,918 --> 00:31:57,291
Bora Bora Hivasta Sleep is far.
Do you know where we are?

319
00:31:57,418 --> 00:32:00,535
Not really,
devices do not work.

320
00:32:01,168 --> 00:32:04,783
Would you like a sandwich?
Do the devices work?

321
00:32:04,918 --> 00:32:08,782
Do not.
There is a ham and cheese...

322
00:32:08,918 --> 00:32:10,790
and cheese only.

323
00:32:12,335 --> 00:32:18,202
Do we fall, we?
It sounds like a negative.

324
00:32:18,335 --> 00:32:22,199
Prefers the term "catastrophic mistake".

325
00:32:22,335 --> 00:32:24,373
It is a professional.

326
00:32:25,293 --> 00:32:27,663
Get ready!

327
00:32:34,752 --> 00:32:37,666
Welcome to the Sleep Hivaan.

328
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:46,664
Greetings from Tahiti.

329
00:32:48,252 --> 00:32:50,373
BEAUTIFUL Polynesia

330
00:32:50,502 --> 00:32:52,292
Tahiti SHINE.

331
00:32:52,419 --> 00:32:53,995
FLEE FROM SLEEP HIVAAN

332
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:14,708
We're here.

333
00:33:19,211 --> 00:33:21,367
<i>Senor.</i>

334
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:27,372
Paysan!

335
00:33:32,169 --> 00:33:34,206
Thank you.

336
00:33:41,627 --> 00:33:44,625
Service charge.
It is not included in the price.

337
00:33:46,086 --> 00:33:49,914
Tahiti, according to the
book does not give tip.

338
00:33:50,044 --> 00:33:54,915
Do you believe in the book, or Ernesto?
We were to die many times!

339
00:33:55,044 --> 00:33:59,369
You're honeymooners.
Better Aphrodisiac not to look.

340
00:33:59,503 --> 00:34:03,448
See, it works already.
Enter now.

341
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:08,084
Right.

342
00:34:11,419 --> 00:34:16,657
<i>Gracias.  A nice honeymoon.
Pedal once for me.</i>

343
00:34:24,461 --> 00:34:27,909
<i>Con su Permiso.</i>

344
00:34:55,795 --> 00:34:58,709
Do not even think about it.

345
00:35:31,962 --> 00:35:34,960
- Hi.
- Hello.

346
00:35:35,087 --> 00:35:39,661
Brick that it is a favorite.
Because it arouses passion?

347
00:35:39,795 --> 00:35:45,164
I like the taste of it. Are you up to?
I'd love to.

348
00:35:45,962 --> 00:35:50,121
I have never had such a beautiful place
.

349
00:35:50,253 --> 00:35:56,286
Honeymoon of your dreams would be a village,
and dance barefoot in the moonlight.

350
00:35:56,420 --> 00:36:01,410
I do not see Brick agreeing to.
I will not marry with the Brick.

351
00:36:02,545 --> 00:36:06,325
I'm going to marry the man she loves with.

352
00:36:09,045 --> 00:36:13,749
I like your idea, in fact
honeymooners in the jungle.

353
00:36:13,879 --> 00:36:17,410
Do you like?
I like, I wanted a photographer.

354
00:36:17,545 --> 00:36:21,242
National Geographic, and I was going to see the world.
Contrary to what happened.

355
00:36:21,379 --> 00:36:24,377
I take pictures of pets
tyhmissä clothes.

356
00:36:24,504 --> 00:36:29,042
After getting citizenship, I open
a dance school. I was lucky.

357
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:34,041
My parents paid tuntini.
I want to give other children the same.

358
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:37,915
It's great, really cutting edge.

359
00:36:38,045 --> 00:36:42,868
A toast for finding happiness.
Happiness.

360
00:36:44,587 --> 00:36:50,168
Good, my passion wakes up.
Not robe because I did not feel.

361
00:36:52,504 --> 00:36:57,042
I can not believe was married.
I'm not.

362
00:37:00,212 --> 00:37:04,253
Okay, you get a bed.
I sleep in an armchair.

363
00:37:04,379 --> 00:37:08,586
- Are you sure?
- All yours.

364
00:37:10,504 --> 00:37:14,545
Where you going?
A breath of fresh air.

365
00:37:14,671 --> 00:37:18,083
Day has been a long,
I almost died.

366
00:37:18,837 --> 00:37:25,249
Right.
Do not monitor, waiting for the gold.

367
00:37:56,171 --> 00:38:00,959
- Do you take more?
- Absolutely.

368
00:38:01,088 --> 00:38:04,121
Thank you, Al.

369
00:38:04,254 --> 00:38:08,912
Laitetaanko room spike?
Place, 12 bungalow.

370
00:38:09,046 --> 00:38:12,246
Bridal Suite.
Where is your wife?

371
00:38:13,338 --> 00:38:16,336
My wife... He sleeps.

372
00:38:16,463 --> 00:38:20,124
It was a long
and he is at the very end.

373
00:38:21,046 --> 00:38:24,791
In fact, I päästäisi man out,
if it is my honeymoon.

374
00:38:24,921 --> 00:38:29,164
Time naughty.
You long to more romance.

375
00:38:29,296 --> 00:38:31,915
You have no idea.

376
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:36,746
Where can he be?

377
00:38:38,088 --> 00:38:43,208
Dancing. She is a dancer.
And it sucks, I can not dance.

378
00:38:43,338 --> 00:38:46,834
It is easily reversible.
Where are we headed?

379
00:38:46,963 --> 00:38:50,625
For dance lesson.
It does not seem to be a good idea.

380
00:38:50,755 --> 00:38:55,293
You need to relax.
Show me your best.

381
00:38:55,422 --> 00:38:58,752
The best me your motion?
Exactly.

382
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:05,748
Stop. You gotta be kidding.
I do not, of course.

383
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:09,921
It's what I thought.
Focus on the music.

384
00:39:10,047 --> 00:39:15,711
And move those hips.
These hips are moving.

385
00:39:15,838 --> 00:39:19,085
And the move.

386
00:39:19,213 --> 00:39:23,752
Close your eyes . And imagine that you are
with your wife.

387
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:28,999
You can smell her perfume.

388
00:39:30,089 --> 00:39:32,755
You will feel the heat of his skin.

389
00:39:34,297 --> 00:39:37,081
I can feel it.

390
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:41,328
I can feel it. I dance.

391
00:39:43,922 --> 00:39:46,126
It took barley bread.

392
00:39:51,755 --> 00:39:55,666
Masha, come dance with me.
You've got a couple already had.

393
00:39:55,797 --> 00:39:59,494
He just taught me,
so I could surprise you.

394
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:03,790
I'm not a naistennaurattaja.

395
00:40:03,922 --> 00:40:08,461
I know that men hate the game.
Bryan...

396
00:40:08,589 --> 00:40:11,273
You do not know anything.
Do what you want, as

397
00:40:11,274 --> 00:40:13,958
long as you do not
compromise the citizenship.

398
00:40:14,089 --> 00:40:18,545
Hinkkaus honeymoon
waiter at the beginning is a stupid.

399
00:40:18,672 --> 00:40:21,125
You're right.

400
00:40:22,214 --> 00:40:25,414
You're right. Sorry.

401
00:40:27,047 --> 00:40:31,705
You look great in that dress.

402
00:40:33,506 --> 00:40:36,918
This is a case of
that I can get citizenship.

403
00:40:37,047 --> 00:40:42,167
And my father, that you pay your debts.
Not about anything else.

404
00:40:48,214 --> 00:40:51,876
Brick Land!
Stews is not enough and goats.

405
00:40:52,006 --> 00:40:54,541
Mary not to talk to the cook.

406
00:40:55,631 --> 00:41:01,130
Have you heard of the liaison officer?
Because of the storm, all is mute.

407
00:41:01,256 --> 00:41:07,288
I do not trust the photographer.
I'm going to keep an eye on him to himself.

408
00:41:19,798 --> 00:41:22,369
Hi.

409
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:35,672
- Hi.
- Hello.

410
00:41:35,798 --> 00:41:40,870
I organized you to the broth.
It was my fault.

411
00:41:41,006 --> 00:41:44,253
I know how you can make it up.

412
00:41:44,381 --> 00:41:49,169
Close is a sheltered cove.
It is incredibly romantic.

413
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:53,872
You can swim in the nude, if you wish.
I think we stay in the pool.

414
00:41:54,006 --> 00:41:57,952
He does not seem to want to see...
Here, I drew the map.

415
00:41:58,090 --> 00:42:01,953
I swear that it will solve
all your problems.

416
00:42:07,131 --> 00:42:11,705
Hi, Mom.
I am lonely. Being here

417
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:16,378
<i>is just as much fun as hemorrhoids.
Was it worth  to hit the police.</i>

418
00:42:16,507 --> 00:42:20,963
I did not drive too fast,
he deserved it. Please be patient.

419
00:42:21,090 --> 00:42:26,790
Dingle plumber. I'm not Walt.
The kitchen sink, the smell of death.

420
00:42:26,923 --> 00:42:30,455
It would not be the first time.

421
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:35,129
Why else would you answer the phone?
You should trample on your wife.

422
00:42:35,965 --> 00:42:40,504
It's just a transaction.
He ​​did not even like me.

423
00:42:40,632 --> 00:42:45,372
I'm not prevented it, I do not have
dad. But the slow lane.

424
00:42:45,507 --> 00:42:48,837
All I say.

425
00:42:48,965 --> 00:42:52,165
And you had nothing more to say.

426
00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:06,586
- Hi.
- Hello.

427
00:43:08,674 --> 00:43:13,296
Can you grease my back?
Of course.

428
00:43:18,757 --> 00:43:22,916
Excuse me yesterday.
I ylireagoin.

429
00:43:23,049 --> 00:43:28,832
The day was stressful for both.
Let's forget the whole thing.

430
00:43:28,965 --> 00:43:31,632
Right.

431
00:43:34,590 --> 00:43:37,672
I heard a very nice lagoon.

432
00:43:39,341 --> 00:43:43,879
It's beautiful.
We can go for a swim down the...

433
00:43:44,007 --> 00:43:48,215
We can go for a swim.
Or whatever you want.

434
00:43:51,257 --> 00:43:53,746
How did you hear about this?

435
00:43:53,882 --> 00:43:58,504
To be honest it is the waiter drew the map.

436
00:43:58,632 --> 00:44:04,581
He felt guilty about yesterday and told
that should appear here.

437
00:44:04,716 --> 00:44:08,756
Here is a splendid thing.
I have. Wait, hold that position.

438
00:44:09,632 --> 00:44:13,080
Beautiful. Okay...

439
00:44:13,216 --> 00:44:16,581
Yes, Mrs. Lighthouse. Well done...

440
00:44:16,716 --> 00:44:19,500
It looks good.

441
00:44:19,633 --> 00:44:24,171
Smile as I was considering, why are you
sailor outfit. Since you are a cat.

442
00:44:24,299 --> 00:44:29,917
Laughing only, it is a job.
And the owners are the only crazy.

443
00:44:30,049 --> 00:44:33,913
Apart from your mother. He is not stupid.
He ​​is the top.

444
00:44:34,049 --> 00:44:38,872
And your father. Do you remember?
"Gorko..." They're not great people.

445
00:44:39,008 --> 00:44:43,167
They are criminals.
But they are my parents.

446
00:44:44,174 --> 00:44:48,168
You are not the only one
which is a family problem.

447
00:44:49,383 --> 00:44:52,416
All they think my dad gone.

448
00:44:53,508 --> 00:44:57,371
But my mother killed her.
Oh, my God.

449
00:44:57,508 --> 00:45:03,042
The mother buried him in the back yard.
The client's two dogs...

450
00:45:04,133 --> 00:45:08,541
digging up his father. They smell the
water from his beard or something.

451
00:45:08,675 --> 00:45:15,205
They ran to the father's bones in his mouth.
It consisted of dog fighting.

452
00:45:15,341 --> 00:45:19,086
You are a terrible liar.
I had to go in therapy.

453
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:22,913
<i>Ran to the father's bones in his mouth...</i>

454
00:45:34,133 --> 00:45:37,581
Here is a really beautiful.
This is the case.

455
00:45:37,716 --> 00:45:41,497
Stay still.
I'll take two, three... it rains.

456
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:47,083
Do you know what.

457
00:45:47,217 --> 00:45:52,288
Now, let's do it. Come in water, Rouvas
. Come on!

458
00:45:57,842 --> 00:46:00,626
That only.

459
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:03,840
It became clear to the whole thing.

460
00:46:03,967 --> 00:46:06,834
What are you doing?
For more of your earnings.

461
00:46:06,967 --> 00:46:09,834
What are? Now I get it.

462
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:14,166
Here you go!

463
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:18,590
Yes! A perfect fit!
Flicker. What about now?

464
00:46:18,717 --> 00:46:21,040
Come!

465
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:26,754
Wait. Did you hear that?
I guess it's Brick. What kind of water?

466
00:46:26,884 --> 00:46:32,501
Throw shorts here! I'm serious.
If anyone sees me so, I'm...

467
00:46:32,634 --> 00:46:35,881
Take care too much.
It's just an animal.

468
00:46:36,009 --> 00:46:39,339
Throw shorts here. Masha!

469
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:46,254
Masha.

470
00:46:47,842 --> 00:46:51,006
<i>A really fun, Masha.
Where are you?</i>

471
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:55,049
Masha?

472
00:47:13,051 --> 00:47:17,957
It's fine.
Lahjapuodista. It is Guccia.

473
00:47:19,051 --> 00:47:23,258
You seem to enjoy the honeymoon.
Exactly.

474
00:47:23,384 --> 00:47:27,923
Have you seen my wife?
Pikkolo just let him inside.

475
00:47:32,509 --> 00:47:36,503
A really fun,
that you left me there.

476
00:47:39,301 --> 00:47:43,709
You Tarzan, me Tonya.
How did you get here?

477
00:47:43,843 --> 00:47:47,504
Bonus Points. Do not say now, that
tossing them in vain.

478
00:47:47,634 --> 00:47:52,256
You have to go.
As soon as the clean puskasi.

479
00:47:52,384 --> 00:47:55,169
<i>- Yes?
-  Your mother is here.</i>

480
00:47:55,301 --> 00:47:57,754
Stop. Hi, Mom.

481
00:47:57,884 --> 00:48:00,882
Thank God.
At last you have got started.

482
00:48:01,009 --> 00:48:06,165
I can not talk right now.
Take it easy foreplay.

483
00:48:06,301 --> 00:48:10,591
Hungry everything looks good.
Whether it stuck.

484
00:48:12,718 --> 00:48:17,375
All I say.
Can you pass patukkani?

485
00:48:19,009 --> 00:48:22,920
Stop it! I am married.
Tao, it is already on your head.

486
00:48:25,968 --> 00:48:29,499
It is Masha! Masha?
Where are you, Masha?

487
00:48:29,635 --> 00:48:34,339
<i>We want 10 million
six dollars tomorrow.</i>

488
00:48:34,468 --> 00:48:39,007
<i>Kill him, if you contact
police. Tilinumerotekstarilla.</i>

489
00:48:39,135 --> 00:48:44,918
<i>I plot, I do not have the money.
Find someone, else he will die.</i>

490
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:52,463
Now you should be aware of the waters.

491
00:48:52,593 --> 00:48:55,295
Who are you?

492
00:48:55,426 --> 00:48:59,503
Where do you take me? Shut up.

493
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:11,213
Masha have been kidnapped.
Do not look at me.

494
00:49:12,510 --> 00:49:16,456
After all, it seemed to have gone well.
Someone grabbed my wife.

495
00:49:16,593 --> 00:49:21,416
There lagoon. What do you know about it?
I do nothing. And who is he?

496
00:49:21,552 --> 00:49:25,759
His girlfriend. What about you?
You're not my girlfriend!

497
00:49:25,885 --> 00:49:29,049
Calm down and tell me what happened.

498
00:49:32,885 --> 00:49:35,456
What's up?

499
00:49:37,427 --> 00:49:42,001
Your friend was here yesterday and
hinkkasi with the waiter.

500
00:49:42,135 --> 00:49:45,169
Even worse.
He ​​took naisesi jungle.

501
00:49:45,302 --> 00:49:49,342
He returned to his bottom bare
joking, and leaves a blanket.

502
00:49:49,469 --> 00:49:52,751
He's quite a dog.

503
00:49:55,885 --> 00:50:00,875
That's it.
I knew that the union was not authentic.

504
00:50:01,010 --> 00:50:06,130
No one mind would not leave me.
He will die, if I call someone.

505
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:10,585
The same they always they repeat, the only.
What is the worst thing that can happen?

506
00:50:10,719 --> 00:50:14,547
He can not die!
Do not cry, I'm just trying to help!

507
00:50:14,677 --> 00:50:19,963
How do you get your hands on 10 million?
I do not know. Perhaps apeltani.

508
00:50:20,094 --> 00:50:25,628
Case solved, now room service.
Shut up, Tony!

509
00:50:26,677 --> 00:50:32,176
Masha's father learns that the girl
was abducted in a remote lagoon...

510
00:50:32,302 --> 00:50:36,794
I am being tortured and cut up!
I can not ask money from him.

511
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:41,501
Then there is only one.
You have to save him.

512
00:50:42,802 --> 00:50:47,507
Do I look like from Batman? I take
pictures of dogs dressed as a pirate.

513
00:50:47,636 --> 00:50:51,132
I know the island inside out,
my cousin as well. We will help you.

514
00:50:51,261 --> 00:50:53,927
You have helped me enough already.

515
00:50:54,052 --> 00:50:56,671
Are you accusing me of everything?
Perhaps it should be.

516
00:50:56,802 --> 00:51:00,843
I just want to improve your association.
After all, you love her.

517
00:51:00,969 --> 00:51:05,377
And not to love. He only helps
girls get a residence permit.

518
00:51:05,511 --> 00:51:08,213
Hiva Sleep is not spoiled size.

519
00:51:08,344 --> 00:51:12,504
We can find him.
Do you have other options?

520
00:51:14,511 --> 00:51:18,172
<i>The door open! Fast. Go ahead.</i>

521
00:51:18,303 --> 00:51:20,921
- What are?
- Go now.

522
00:51:21,053 --> 00:51:24,632
<i>Where are we going? Door open!</i>

523
00:51:29,636 --> 00:51:33,333
Hi, Brick. Why is this joy?
Masha.

524
00:51:39,303 --> 00:51:43,427
Do not get this wrong.
I slept in an armchair.

525
00:51:43,553 --> 00:51:46,421
You should kill you right away.
I promised...

526
00:51:46,553 --> 00:51:48,923
Hurry up. Jump.

527
00:51:49,053 --> 00:51:52,418
Where is he?
I do not know. It hurts.

528
00:51:52,553 --> 00:51:56,084
Jump! I'll catch you.
Are you crazy?

529
00:51:56,220 --> 00:51:59,171
Jump!

530
00:52:00,845 --> 00:52:03,463
Good stalls, cougar.

531
00:52:06,011 --> 00:52:09,507
For your information only, that Bryan is mine.
So do not imagine too much.

532
00:52:09,636 --> 00:52:14,175
I just want to help. What about you?
When did you say about time.

533
00:52:14,303 --> 00:52:18,000
I need to find my cousin.
What about me?

534
00:52:18,136 --> 00:52:23,126
Shop for Supplies . Can you survive it?
Better than you, babe.

535
00:52:27,845 --> 00:52:30,759
The last opportunity.
Where is he?

536
00:52:30,887 --> 00:52:34,418
The pool, he is the pool.

537
00:52:34,553 --> 00:52:37,468
It would be the best.

538
00:53:04,137 --> 00:53:08,628
Where is Masha? Tell the truth,
or cut off your neck.

539
00:53:12,179 --> 00:53:14,418
My cousin is here.

540
00:53:14,554 --> 00:53:19,258
He and the waitress trying to rescue the girl.
That is all I know.

541
00:53:20,804 --> 00:53:23,755
There is a cousin.

542
00:53:34,762 --> 00:53:38,886
It is to make a new plan.
Ernesto will help us.

543
00:53:39,012 --> 00:53:42,627
Ernesto?
The bird is repaired and ready for takeoff.

544
00:53:42,762 --> 00:53:47,752
I am 68 percent sure.
Almost 70 Well done.

545
00:53:47,887 --> 00:53:51,751
One of the big foreign
tried to kill me. Pool.

546
00:53:51,887 --> 00:53:55,051
He was looking for Sasha or Nashaa...
What did you tell him?

547
00:53:55,179 --> 00:53:58,212
Any. I'm not stupid.
It's all over, I'm dead.

548
00:53:58,346 --> 00:54:02,884
Rescue him and save 10 million
father's money. You will become a hero.

549
00:54:03,012 --> 00:54:07,586
Cast off soon. Otherwise, you have a date
that guy with the fists.

550
00:54:07,721 --> 00:54:10,802
All right, let's go then.

551
00:54:10,929 --> 00:54:14,839
Do not leave me here.
Make a space.

552
00:54:14,971 --> 00:54:17,838
Here we go.

553
00:54:34,471 --> 00:54:37,042
Time to party.

554
00:54:39,221 --> 00:54:41,295
Oh no!

555
00:54:43,013 --> 00:54:47,172
He shoots!
What are you doing? Oh, my God.

556
00:54:47,304 --> 00:54:49,971
Maastoudu, little lady.

557
00:54:55,679 --> 00:54:59,460
I need your feet. This purpose.

558
00:55:03,346 --> 00:55:05,550

00:55:13,179 --> 00:55:16,430
- Right.
- You get to drive!

560
00:55:18,513 --> 00:55:22,720
Now the fun part of the unexpected.
What's the fun part?

561
00:56:17,888 --> 00:56:21,254
- We're here.
- Okay.

562
00:56:24,347 --> 00:56:28,387
Is it intact?
Mostly intact than broken.

563
00:56:28,513 --> 00:56:33,218
Are you all right, little lady?
What you did was great.

564
00:56:33,347 --> 00:56:36,677
And it is only the beginning.

565
00:56:42,597 --> 00:56:46,638
Suffer from travel sickness.
I need to get front seat.

566
00:56:47,430 --> 00:56:50,464
Ernesto!

567
00:57:00,097 --> 00:57:02,799
And then move.

568
00:57:09,764 --> 00:57:12,632
Another worthwhile to hurry.

569
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:19,760

571
00:57:23,222 --> 00:57:26,635

573
00:57:31,472 --> 00:57:34,589
Come, cousin. Come on, Ernesto.

00:57:34,722 --> 00:57:38,384

575
00:57:39,764 --> 00:57:42,797
Okay...

576
00:57:42,931 --> 00:57:45,384
Right.

577
00:57:45,514 --> 00:57:49,010
We rise into the air!

578
00:58:12,973 --> 00:58:16,220
I handled it!

579
00:58:17,139 --> 00:58:20,587
This is a lot of fun.

580
00:58:20,723 --> 00:58:25,629
<i>Tell me,  carida mi,

He is the son of a girlfriend.
But Bryan is now married to...

582
00:58:30,889 --> 00:58:35,712
I think I'll puke.
Can I have a tequila?

583
00:58:46,098 --> 00:58:51,170
Is that legal?
Not as much fun as my kitchen,

584
00:58:51,306 --> 00:58:54,139
but we do our best.

585
00:59:00,140 --> 00:59:03,505
Do not worry,

586
00:59:09,973 --> 00:59:12,640
Everything is just fine.

Who did it?
He was taken to the plot...

590
00:59:38,015 --> 00:59:43,466
Was going to do what?
Export virginity. The man came back naked.

Me Bitches could not be found.
This is not the food. What do we eat?

What does he mean?

608
01:02:40,475 --> 01:02:43,177
Is he one of Rambo?

620
01:03:50,934 --> 01:03:53,304
Stay still!

621
01:04:00,309 --> 01:04:02,595
On your feet on!

622
01:04:19,809 --> 01:04:23,554
There were two Americans
nelivedollaan two days ago.

623
01:04:23,684 --> 01:04:26,599
They bought supplies and
sustainable fishing line.

624
01:04:26,726 --> 01:04:31,015
They went fishing.
They headed to the mountains beings.

625
01:04:31,142 --> 01:04:33,678
They sound like really stupid.

626
01:04:35,434 --> 01:04:39,973
Inland, is a place where surfers
lautojaan worked.

627
01:04:40,101 --> 01:04:44,639
We somehow found it.
We can fly back.

628
01:04:44,767 --> 01:04:48,975
The best surprise them on foot.
How long is the way it is there?

629
01:04:49,101 --> 01:04:52,301
At least a couple of hours.
A couple of hours! Creator!

630
01:04:52,434 --> 01:04:56,345
Shut up!
Are they even the kidnappers?

631
01:04:56,476 --> 01:05:00,221
And whether they are certainly out there?
Do you have a better idea?

632
01:05:00,351 --> 01:05:05,553
I do not mean that the read
"10tapaa to satisfy a man."

633
01:05:05,684 --> 01:05:09,465
At least I do not tickle the dog bags.
I do not kutittanut...

634
01:05:09,601 --> 01:05:13,760
Will you come with us or not?

635
01:05:17,309 --> 01:05:19,300
All right.

636
01:05:19,434 --> 01:05:21,923
But first I need to cool off.

637
01:05:22,059 --> 01:05:24,762
Do you have to cool off?

638
01:05:38,435 --> 01:05:41,635
His words make sense.

639
01:05:51,310 --> 01:05:53,715
I beg your pardon.

640
01:06:01,851 --> 01:06:04,885
What are the chances?

641
01:06:05,018 --> 01:06:08,514
It's not options,
if you want to survive.

642
01:06:10,018 --> 01:06:12,969
It is no longer I.

643
01:06:27,518 --> 01:06:32,341
Did you call the police?
I do not, he was killed.

644
01:06:32,477 --> 01:06:36,387
I should have to call
you in the past, but...

645
01:06:36,518 --> 01:06:40,464
The truth is,
that I think I love your daughter.

646
01:06:42,435 --> 01:06:45,054
I'm trying to find him, but...

647
01:06:46,893 --> 01:06:52,096
The possibilities are great.
If I is not before six...

648
01:06:52,227 --> 01:06:58,638
move the money.
Account number is: 46564...

649
01:07:07,727 --> 01:07:12,847
Did you find him? The helicopter is
on the other side of the island.

650
01:07:12,977 --> 01:07:16,508
Lighthouse is behind everything, such as
oletimmekin.

651
01:07:16,644 --> 01:07:20,933
He gets paid the ultimate price!
Masha is the only child.

652
01:07:21,060 --> 01:07:24,011
If you can not find Mashaa before six...

653
01:07:25,102 --> 01:07:28,717
I move the money.
Do what you must do.

654
01:07:35,686 --> 01:07:41,931
The helicopter did not return.
He's fine. Is there a problem?

655
01:07:42,061 --> 01:07:44,596
None, which I found out.

656
01:07:50,644 --> 01:07:55,301
I do not want to interrupt your
journey teen, but we have to leave.

657
01:07:55,436 --> 01:07:57,924
Could we try to save his life?

658
01:08:01,144 --> 01:08:05,090
I think I twisted my ankle.
Come on!

659
01:08:05,227 --> 01:08:09,008
We gotta go!
You are really insensitive.

660
01:08:09,144 --> 01:08:14,762
Do not leave me? I will follow.

661
01:08:14,894 --> 01:08:19,101
This is characterized by you!
Even a selfish...

662
01:08:19,228 --> 01:08:21,302
sexist jerk!

663
01:08:21,436 --> 01:08:27,799
Look, I'm not decided, that the men
will improve as they get older.

664
01:08:27,936 --> 01:08:33,056
For women do not experience the same.
I understand.

665
01:09:56,853 --> 01:09:59,223
I need to get to the bathroom!

666
01:10:02,395 --> 01:10:05,559
Treat thing.
And käpäläsi keep away from him.

667
01:10:06,645 --> 01:10:08,719
Treat, treat.

668
01:10:21,812 --> 01:10:24,265
Where is he?

669
01:10:41,312 --> 01:10:45,519
How else could ankles?
Well, you hurt ankles.

670
01:10:45,645 --> 01:10:50,516
I'm trying to find it. I walk towards it.
I can see the feet.

671
01:10:50,645 --> 01:10:53,134
What a beauty.

672
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:59,968
I thought I knew all of this island.

673
01:11:00,104 --> 01:11:04,145
The same.
Is everything all right?

674
01:11:04,271 --> 01:11:07,185
My cousin needs to make sense
kalahduksen kalloonsa.

675
01:11:20,062 --> 01:11:25,218
Where is your boyfriend?
Nod, where he is in the village.

676
01:11:25,354 --> 01:11:27,594
Where did he go?

677
01:11:27,729 --> 01:11:30,478
Vuorilleko?

678
01:11:31,396 --> 01:11:37,262
I take a hand off the front of your mouth.
I'll kill you if You scream.

679
01:12:02,104 --> 01:12:04,937
Stay still!

680
01:12:08,979 --> 01:12:13,637
Damn! He ​​is a sought back!

681
01:12:21,938 --> 01:12:23,928
- Who is it?
- I.

682
01:12:24,063 --> 01:12:29,727
Where are you? I'm trying to find you.
There was a good and surfboards.

683
01:12:35,021 --> 01:12:37,095
Smew!

684
01:12:39,521 --> 01:12:41,642
They will come, I'll call back.

685
01:12:55,563 --> 01:12:59,260
What happened?
I do not remember.

686
01:12:59,396 --> 01:13:01,387
Wait a minute...

687
01:13:01,521 --> 01:13:06,724
Blood returned to the upper end.
Friend's life is saved!

688
01:14:30,606 --> 01:14:32,680
- Yes?
- Where is he?

689
01:14:32,814 --> 01:14:37,352
He got away.
Did? Urpoja What are you?

690
01:14:37,481 --> 01:14:40,099
Get him back. Now!

691
01:15:06,398 --> 01:15:10,438
Thanks a lot, Bryan.
An alien crush my face.

692
01:15:10,564 --> 01:15:13,645
How can I now work as a model?

693
01:16:59,732 --> 01:17:02,351
Masha!

694
01:17:02,482 --> 01:17:05,017
We gotta go!

695
01:17:05,148 --> 01:17:06,689
Run, run!

696
01:17:19,899 --> 01:17:21,356
Jump!

697
01:17:34,065 --> 01:17:35,855
Come.

698
01:17:41,399 --> 01:17:43,638
Did you find them?

699
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:47,312
They are in the valley.

700
01:17:50,691 --> 01:17:53,854
- See!
- Maybe we can use it.

701
01:17:53,982 --> 01:17:56,056
I hope it works yet.

702
01:17:57,024 --> 01:18:00,105
- Oh my God!
- Hurry up!

703
01:18:02,774 --> 01:18:04,729
Melo!

704
01:18:09,982 --> 01:18:11,807
Hurry up!

705
01:18:12,857 --> 01:18:15,097
Maastoudu!

706
01:18:15,232 --> 01:18:16,974
Melo!

707
01:18:19,274 --> 01:18:21,597
Try to play!

708
01:18:32,316 --> 01:18:35,100
Masha herein.
Are you all right?

709
01:18:35,316 --> 01:18:37,555
All is well. I was able to get away.
He got away.

710
01:18:37,983 --> 01:18:40,352
Who is behind the kidnapping?

711
01:18:40,566 --> 01:18:42,059
It was...

712
01:18:44,358 --> 01:18:46,976
Hurry up! I dropped the phone!

713
01:18:47,108 --> 01:18:48,849
Hello? Masha?

714
01:18:56,399 --> 01:18:58,604
No more mistakes!

715
01:19:06,691 --> 01:19:10,732
Meloin time with their father.
When a shot is not so much.

716
01:19:14,316 --> 01:19:17,018
What really happened to your father?

717
01:19:19,900 --> 01:19:22,933
He was the South Pole...

718
01:19:23,066 --> 01:19:25,555
and he was attacked by...

719
01:19:27,233 --> 01:19:31,097
flock of penguins. They are not
as cute as you might think.

720
01:19:31,233 --> 01:19:36,732
It was really difficult to put
on our wedding evening dress.

721
01:19:36,858 --> 01:19:41,681
When I looked in the mirror, I just
thought, how he tried to escape from them.

722
01:19:50,108 --> 01:19:52,513
- You and your...
- He's alive!

723
01:19:52,650 --> 01:19:55,767
He went away for a long time ago.
I do not know him.

724
01:19:55,900 --> 01:20:00,806
<i>But my mother is  crazy.
He is under house arrest.</i>

725
01:20:02,150 --> 01:20:05,065
- What is it?
- Do you hear that?

726
01:20:06,983 --> 01:20:09,732
What do they say?

727
01:20:09,858 --> 01:20:13,022
Melovan They want us there.

728
01:20:13,150 --> 01:20:16,681
I can not believe that,
this place is still there.

729
01:20:26,358 --> 01:20:31,063
Do you understand what he says?
I do not. But he is friendly.

730
01:20:35,817 --> 01:20:38,980
Villains. We need help.
Do you have a phone?

731
01:20:39,109 --> 01:20:45,058
Right! Do you have a phone, such as
iPhone or Blackberry?

732
01:21:56,401 --> 01:21:58,475
Shall We Dance?

733
01:22:14,526 --> 01:22:19,728
You look great.
You do not have a bad self.

734
01:22:22,026 --> 01:22:27,774
We danced in the moonlight in the village.
Is this a dream honeymoon?

735
01:22:29,443 --> 01:22:32,524
Is it yours?

736
01:22:32,651 --> 01:22:35,436
Will you marry me?

737
01:22:36,943 --> 01:22:40,688
Unfortunately, I,
I'm already married.

738
01:23:31,027 --> 01:23:35,684
I was most proud of the third.
I did not cry it all at once.

739
01:23:44,693 --> 01:23:46,684
Let's go.

740
01:23:53,568 --> 01:23:56,235
- Is not it wonderful?
- It is.

741
01:23:56,360 --> 01:23:59,975
If you still would have a cappuccino.

742
01:24:04,902 --> 01:24:10,934
Calculator, just kidding.
We do not need no...

743
01:24:21,319 --> 01:24:23,226
High-Good!

744
01:24:29,110 --> 01:24:31,681
You have to get out of here!

745
01:24:31,819 --> 01:24:35,149
Do you speak English?
I used to work on Wall Street.

746
01:24:54,277 --> 01:24:56,019
Grab the magazine and sit on it!

747
01:25:11,361 --> 01:25:12,937
Move!

748
01:25:52,403 --> 01:25:55,899
Go away from him!
Do not go, he will kill you!

749
01:25:56,028 --> 01:25:59,524
Go to farther,
if you want her to live!

750
01:26:09,153 --> 01:26:13,894
Are you all right, Masha?
You are not the savior, he was hired.

751
01:26:14,028 --> 01:26:16,599
What are? I never would do that.

752
01:26:16,736 --> 01:26:19,225
I thought you loved me. I love.

753
01:26:19,361 --> 01:26:22,857
Be honest with me then.

754
01:26:25,861 --> 01:26:28,563
They treated you well?

755
01:26:28,695 --> 01:26:32,143
Why are you doing this?
Because I am ambitious.

756
01:26:32,278 --> 01:26:36,770
As your father. Is not that satisfied with the women?
So you're planning to steal from him?

757
01:26:36,903 --> 01:26:40,600
I did it for you.
We are getting married.

758
01:26:40,736 --> 01:26:43,439
I never would go to marry you!

759
01:26:43,570 --> 01:26:47,978
You are a sick, violent and crazy.
I have never loved you.

760
01:26:48,112 --> 01:26:51,358
Honesty I do not think
right now inherit land.

761
01:26:56,320 --> 01:26:57,944
What do you say about this?

762
01:26:57,945 --> 01:26:58,940
What do you say about this?

763
01:26:59,070 --> 01:27:03,313
The new husband was kidnapped by you
and I shot him.

764
01:27:03,445 --> 01:27:08,102
But he could push you down the cliff
. A tragic end!

765
01:27:15,112 --> 01:27:17,351
There they are!

766
01:27:51,279 --> 01:27:53,981
The honeymoon is officially over!

767
01:28:03,404 --> 01:28:04,861
Not!

768
01:28:04,987 --> 01:28:07,143
Creator!

769
01:28:28,154 --> 01:28:30,477
Bryan!

770
01:29:01,029 --> 01:29:04,608
<i>Senor,  let me.
Senorita, porfavor.</i>

771
01:29:06,446 --> 01:29:09,230
That he is, Get him!

772
01:29:11,696 --> 01:29:16,353
Let him go, he did not do anything
! Let go of me!

773
01:29:17,446 --> 01:29:22,234
I'm fine, Mom.
Stop this! He did not do anything!

774
01:29:31,738 --> 01:29:35,814
You saved my daughter.
Säästit $ 10 million.

775
01:29:35,946 --> 01:29:38,648
Revealed Bricklandin traitor.

776
01:29:38,780 --> 01:29:43,899
It does sound like a good reason
to shoot you to the end of!

777
01:29:52,030 --> 01:29:56,023
My wife says that you will make
our blessing to stay married.

778
01:29:56,155 --> 01:29:58,608
In this! It is a wedding present!

01:30:18,780 --> 01:30:21,103
This.

783
01:30:21,238 --> 01:30:23,905
Masha, I love you so much.

784
01:30:24,947 --> 01:30:28,063
But I can not be married
of this family.

785
01:30:47,613 --> 01:30:50,979
No, let him go.

Pull the head off ahterista, do something
about it . It's not that hard.

791
01:31:45,072 --> 01:31:47,229

01:33:46,907 --> 01:33:51,481
Need still the residence permit?
What about my family?

796
01:33:51,615 --> 01:33:54,648
Wait till you meet my own.
