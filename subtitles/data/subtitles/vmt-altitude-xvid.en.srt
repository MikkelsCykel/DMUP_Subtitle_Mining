00:01:13,451 --> 00:01:15,385
- Sorry about the rough ride, Mr. Taylor.

2
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:17,953
This weather just came out of nowhere.
- How much farther?

3
00:01:18,089 --> 00:01:21,422
- I should have you on the ground
in about fifteen minutes.

4
00:01:21,559 --> 00:01:23,891
- Did you hear that, honey?
We're almost home.

5
00:01:25,896 --> 00:01:27,693
- Whatcha reading there, Trooper?

6
00:01:28,499 --> 00:01:30,433
- Sweetie, the nice lady
asked you a question.

7
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:35,906
Ah, last night he would hardly stop
talking about it.

8
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,133
Kept insisting that one of those
dinosaur things

9
00:01:38,275 --> 00:01:39,674
was hiding in the closet.

10
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:41,903
- Oh, dinosaurs, huh?

11
00:01:41,946 --> 00:01:44,244
- Oh yeah, kid's got a heck
of an imagination.

12
00:01:44,382 --> 00:01:47,442
Don't even try talking him out of it.
- I know what you mean.

13
00:01:47,585 --> 00:01:49,450
Oh! My daughter's his age.

14
00:01:49,587 --> 00:01:51,145
She sets her mind on something?

15
00:01:51,288 --> 00:01:52,312
Look out.

16
00:01:52,456 --> 00:01:54,185
- We should get
the two of them together.

17
00:01:54,358 --> 00:01:55,985
- Yeah.

18
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,559
- Sweetie, what is it?

19
00:02:01,031 --> 00:02:02,931
- What's wrong with him?
- I don't know.

20
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,533
Baby, talk to me.

21
00:02:51,015 --> 00:02:52,744
- Oh shit.

22
00:02:53,117 --> 00:02:54,277
- Where are you?

23
00:02:55,886 --> 00:02:57,353
- Ah, we stopped for gas.

24
00:02:57,855 --> 00:02:59,823
- Call my cell
the moment you get to the concert

25
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:01,821
so I know you made it.
- Yes, Dad.

26
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:03,756
- And no booze.
Just because I've lost my mind

27
00:03:03,894 --> 00:03:06,362
and I'm letting you out of my sight
for a whole weekend...

28
00:03:06,497 --> 00:03:07,930
- Don't you trust me?

29
00:03:08,065 --> 00:03:09,794
- I'm your father,
I don't have that luxury.

30
00:03:09,934 --> 00:03:12,562
- Well you better get used to it,
'cause this time next week,

31
00:03:12,736 --> 00:03:14,203
I'll be 3,000 miles away.

32
00:03:14,338 --> 00:03:16,533
- And I couldn't be prouder.

33
00:03:18,242 --> 00:03:19,266
Thanks.

34
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:21,435
Listen, I know you think
you're all grown up

35
00:03:21,579 --> 00:03:24,844
and you don't need my advice,
but you're still just a kid, Sara.

36
00:03:24,982 --> 00:03:27,314
We don't always get second chances
when we screw up.

37
00:03:27,451 --> 00:03:28,713
And another thing,

38
00:03:28,853 --> 00:03:31,788
don't let what's-his-name
behind the wheel, the wrestler.

39
00:03:31,922 --> 00:03:34,186
- I'm not gonna let anyone else
drive, Dad.

40
00:03:35,059 --> 00:03:36,151
Love you.

41
00:03:37,294 --> 00:03:38,659
- Goodbye.

42
00:03:49,807 --> 00:03:51,240
- No regrets, right?

43
00:04:17,902 --> 00:04:20,370
- Yo. Hitchcock.

44
00:04:20,871 --> 00:04:22,702
The action's right here.

45
00:04:22,873 --> 00:04:25,899
- And here we have the fabled
Man-squatch.

46
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:29,076
One false move
could alert him to our presence.

47
00:04:31,949 --> 00:04:35,009
- Raargh!!!

48
00:04:35,152 --> 00:04:37,450
No...no!

49
00:04:47,398 --> 00:04:49,628
Whoa.
Bin Laden, what's up man?

50
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,267
- Sal!... relax.

51
00:04:51,435 --> 00:04:52,902
- Making new friends?

52
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,435
- Yeah, I'm making new friends...

53
00:04:54,605 --> 00:04:56,903
- Ay, ay, ay, wanna be our friend?

54
00:04:57,074 --> 00:04:58,632
Ah, I guess not.

55
00:04:58,809 --> 00:05:01,175
I'm serious, is anybody else
kinda nervous about this guy,

56
00:05:01,345 --> 00:05:02,471
or is it just me?

57
00:05:02,646 --> 00:05:04,580
- It's just you.

58
00:05:05,349 --> 00:05:06,680
Hey, how's it going?

59
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:09,910
- Not bad, looking forward
to a little R&R.

60
00:05:10,087 --> 00:05:12,555
- Yeah, well I don't think
you'll be needing these to crowd surf.

61
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:16,956
- Yeah, well the... um...
canyon's got some nice runs, so...

62
00:05:17,094 --> 00:05:18,459
- You're going to do some
rock climbing?

63
00:05:18,596 --> 00:05:20,223
- Crossed my mind....

64
00:05:24,201 --> 00:05:25,634
Where's uh, where's Sara?

65
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,731
- She's probably taking
another lesson, right?

66
00:05:27,905 --> 00:05:29,395
- You're hilarious.

67
00:05:31,442 --> 00:05:33,410
- Let me shoot some of this.
- Who's the film major?

68
00:05:33,577 --> 00:05:34,908
- Oh, shut up.
- No.

69
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:36,103
- Come on.
- No.

70
00:05:36,246 --> 00:05:38,544
- There she is.
- Ah, I know, I'm late.

71
00:05:38,682 --> 00:05:41,651
A screw-up with our booking,
I had to do a little sweet-talking.

72
00:05:41,785 --> 00:05:44,447
- We still get the plane?
- Have I ever let my best friend down?

73
00:05:44,588 --> 00:05:45,816
- No.

74
00:05:47,992 --> 00:05:49,983
Coldplay, here we come.

75
00:05:50,127 --> 00:05:52,755
- Whooooo!!!!
- This is gonna be a killer, Sara.

76
00:05:52,896 --> 00:05:54,761
Here's to Sara, huh?

77
00:05:54,898 --> 00:05:58,265
The best...
shit, the only pilot I know.

78
00:05:58,602 --> 00:06:02,629
- Are you nuts? Put that away before
you get me in trouble, seriously.

79
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:06,238
- Nice work, cuz.
- Ooof! Careful.

80
00:06:06,377 --> 00:06:08,311
Somebody's been hitting the gym.

81
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,640
- Ah, Sara?

82
00:06:10,814 --> 00:06:12,179
- There you are, hey.

83
00:06:15,386 --> 00:06:17,786
- Oh here, I'll get these for you.

84
00:06:17,955 --> 00:06:20,549
- Sal, take note.
- Ha, ha, ha...

85
00:06:20,691 --> 00:06:21,953
- Hey, man.
- Cory.

86
00:06:22,092 --> 00:06:23,457
- My cousin.
I told you about him.

87
00:06:23,594 --> 00:06:25,118
- Sure, hi.
- Hey, Bruce.

88
00:06:25,295 --> 00:06:28,958
- You know Mel, Sal.
- Smile.

89
00:06:29,133 --> 00:06:31,124
- Okay, are we all set?
- Yeah, come on.

90
00:06:31,301 --> 00:06:32,791
- Yeah, just waitin' on you,
sweet cheeks.

91
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:34,835
- He's such as gentleman, isn't he?
- He's charming.

92
00:06:35,005 --> 00:06:37,940
- Bags?
- Yes, bags, bags, hey, bags!

93
00:06:38,108 --> 00:06:40,008
- Really, man?
- I need some help, come on.

94
00:06:40,177 --> 00:06:42,543
- You okay?
- Yeah, no, I'm fine, I'm fine.

95
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,941
- Ahhh!
- What do you have in this thing?

96
00:06:45,115 --> 00:06:46,776
- Let's go.

97
00:06:46,917 --> 00:06:48,407
- The weather going to be a problem?

98
00:06:48,552 --> 00:06:50,543
- For flying?
- Yeah.

99
00:06:50,721 --> 00:06:53,849
- It's a low cloud,
it'll burn off any minute...

100
00:06:54,024 --> 00:06:57,425
Hey, just relax, okay?

101
00:06:57,594 --> 00:07:00,757
Let me do my thing.
- Okay.

102
00:07:01,265 --> 00:07:03,699
- Hey, so Sara, the General's cool
with this all, right?

103
00:07:04,568 --> 00:07:05,592
- Cool with what?

104
00:07:05,769 --> 00:07:08,499
- With you doing
the whole sky captain thing.

105
00:07:08,672 --> 00:07:11,266
I mean, it didn't really work out
too well for your mom, so...

106
00:07:11,408 --> 00:07:14,104
- Could you be any more insensitive?
- Relax...

107
00:07:14,244 --> 00:07:16,542
Look, no offense, Sara.
I'm just, ya know...

108
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,079
- None taken.

109
00:07:18,248 --> 00:07:21,012
I'm not my mother,
and he's a Colonel.

110
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,611
Let's just go have some fun, okay?

111
00:07:25,723 --> 00:07:27,418
- Yeah, heh.

112
00:07:28,258 --> 00:07:30,089
- Remind me why I'm dating you again?

113
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,316
- That's it?

114
00:08:04,461 --> 00:08:06,088
- What were you expecting?
A private jet?

115
00:08:06,263 --> 00:08:08,891
- For the money we're paying I half
expected John Travolta to walk out.

116
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,163
- Fuel isn't cheap,
we're already getting a discount

117
00:08:12,302 --> 00:08:15,533
through the flight school, so stop.
- Yeah, come on. Live a little.

118
00:08:17,975 --> 00:08:20,307
- How much d'you think one of these
little puddle jumpers costs anyways?

119
00:08:20,477 --> 00:08:22,775
- If the music thing works out,
I'll send you a brochure.

120
00:08:22,913 --> 00:08:25,473
-"If" the music thing works out?
- Sorry, "when" it works out.

121
00:08:25,616 --> 00:08:28,312
- "When" the music thing works out.
- Yeah.

122
00:08:31,188 --> 00:08:33,918
- All right, pilot.
- Okay, baggage goes in the rear.

123
00:08:34,057 --> 00:08:36,082
Everything you don't want
to carry on your laps.

124
00:08:36,226 --> 00:08:39,787
- All right, I'm going in the rear.
- You always got a lot of baggage.

125
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:41,092
- Comin' in.

126
00:08:43,834 --> 00:08:45,825
- I should go talk to him.
I'll be right back.

127
00:08:45,969 --> 00:08:47,596
- Oh yeah, get Rain Man.

128
00:08:47,738 --> 00:08:50,332
- Hey, be nice.
- I'm super nice.

129
00:08:50,474 --> 00:08:53,341
- Get your booty in there.
- God, Sal.

130
00:08:54,878 --> 00:08:55,902
Oh wow.

131
00:08:56,046 --> 00:08:59,106
- Um... we're going to get...
really friendly.

132
00:09:00,017 --> 00:09:02,952
Where'd Sara find the stiff?

133
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,145
- He found her.

134
00:09:05,322 --> 00:09:07,415
- What do you mean he found her?

135
00:09:07,591 --> 00:09:10,424
- He just kinda showed up one day.
She was looking for a study partner.

136
00:09:10,594 --> 00:09:12,562
Smart guy.

137
00:09:12,729 --> 00:09:16,290
- Wait a second, she's playing
hide the sausage with her tutor?

138
00:09:16,466 --> 00:09:18,593
- I guess a big brain can be a turn on.

139
00:09:18,769 --> 00:09:20,327
Not that I speak from experience.

140
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:22,062
- Big brain?
He's a trust fund prick.

141
00:09:22,206 --> 00:09:23,332
- Come on.

142
00:09:25,008 --> 00:09:26,908
- Beer?
- No.

143
00:09:27,077 --> 00:09:30,535
- Trust fund, what do you mean?
His parents rich or something?

144
00:09:31,515 --> 00:09:33,039
- Or something.

145
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:36,351
- You okay?

146
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:39,318
- Yeah, I'm fine.

147
00:09:39,489 --> 00:09:41,013
- You sure?

148
00:09:41,191 --> 00:09:42,988
You don't look so good.

149
00:09:50,801 --> 00:09:53,065
- Yeah, yeah I am, sure.

150
00:09:54,805 --> 00:09:57,706
- Okay... well....

151
00:09:57,875 --> 00:09:59,740
let's go.

152
00:10:00,777 --> 00:10:02,369
- Why do you let Sal do that?

153
00:10:02,546 --> 00:10:04,741
Talk about your mom that way?

154
00:10:04,915 --> 00:10:08,112
- He likes pushing people's buttons.
I'm used to it.

155
00:10:08,285 --> 00:10:10,310
- Well that doesn't mean it's okay.

156
00:10:10,487 --> 00:10:12,250
- Hey, this is our last weekend together.

157
00:10:12,422 --> 00:10:15,186
Do you really want to spend it
arguing about Sal?

158
00:10:15,359 --> 00:10:17,486
- Don't say that.
- Don't say what?

159
00:10:17,661 --> 00:10:18,821
- Last weekend.

160
00:10:18,996 --> 00:10:21,556
You make it sound like we're never
going to see each other again.

161
00:10:21,732 --> 00:10:24,326
- Hey, Montreal's a long way from here.

162
00:10:24,501 --> 00:10:25,968
This is a big deal for me.

163
00:10:26,103 --> 00:10:28,128
- You don't think it's a big deal
for me, too?

164
00:10:29,973 --> 00:10:32,965
- Look, let's not talk about it now,
okay?

165
00:10:37,281 --> 00:10:39,181
You're not afraid to fly, are you?

166
00:10:39,349 --> 00:10:42,250
- Pantheon 520, wind is 330 at 7,

167
00:10:42,386 --> 00:10:43,978
turn right onto taxiway bravo and hold.

168
00:10:54,197 --> 00:10:55,425
520, additional traffic

169
00:10:55,565 --> 00:10:58,500
will be departing shortly
runway one five left.

170
00:10:58,635 --> 00:11:00,330
Six Echo Whiskey,
cleared to land runway three.

171
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:02,438
Be aware of departing traffic
at your one o'clock.

172
00:11:10,113 --> 00:11:11,637
- Sara!

173
00:11:11,782 --> 00:11:13,875
Is it always so noisy?

174
00:11:14,017 --> 00:11:15,848
Sara!

175
00:11:15,986 --> 00:11:18,318
- What?
- Is it always this noisy?

176
00:11:18,455 --> 00:11:22,152
- I don't want to have to dub everything.
- It won't be so bad once we're up.

177
00:11:22,292 --> 00:11:23,418
- Dub everything?
Are you serious?

178
00:11:23,593 --> 00:11:25,356
I just want some better material
for my reel.

179
00:11:25,529 --> 00:11:26,826
- What, and this is better material?

180
00:11:26,964 --> 00:11:29,455
- Don't worry, I'll edit you out.

181
00:11:29,599 --> 00:11:30,998
- By any means necessary.

182
00:11:32,636 --> 00:11:34,866
- You got it.
- Malcolm X, right?

183
00:11:35,005 --> 00:11:36,199
- Very nice.

184
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:39,605
- Actually, it's from Dirty Hands,
the Sartre play.

185
00:11:39,743 --> 00:11:42,405
Jean-Paul Sartre, the existentialist?

186
00:11:42,512 --> 00:11:45,504
Man is what he wills himself to be,
hell is other people...

187
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,879
- I will myself to be awesome.

188
00:11:52,055 --> 00:11:54,455
- So does Sal. Right, babe?

189
00:11:54,591 --> 00:11:56,582
- Yeah.
Get that fucking thing away.

190
00:11:57,794 --> 00:11:58,852
- Philistines.

191
00:12:02,566 --> 00:12:04,124
- Pantheon 520 is released.

192
00:12:04,267 --> 00:12:06,428
Contact Lakeview Centre
11 niner decimal one.

193
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:08,697
- Harrisford Tower,
Yankee Zulu X-ray,

194
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:10,397
ready for take off, one five left

195
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:13,373
- Yankee Zulu X-ray hold short,
one five left.

196
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:15,171
- Yankee Zulu X-ray, holding short.

197
00:12:41,438 --> 00:12:44,236
- Hey, Capitan.
What's our ETA?

198
00:12:44,374 --> 00:12:47,172
- Ah, with a good tail wind,
it's about a 90 minute flight.

199
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:50,643
Nice, plenty of time to
get shitfaced before concert, huh?

200
00:12:51,848 --> 00:12:53,475
- Well, you're well on your way.

201
00:12:53,617 --> 00:12:55,141
- You guys want one?
- No.

202
00:12:55,285 --> 00:12:56,843
- All right, more for me.

203
00:12:58,455 --> 00:13:01,219
- What are those for?
- Um, motion sickness.

204
00:13:01,358 --> 00:13:04,759
- Yeah, try not to yak on me
on this flight. Okay, sweet cheeks?

205
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:07,523
- Thanks for being so supportive.

206
00:13:07,798 --> 00:13:10,289
- At least it's only like an hour
and a half flight.

207
00:13:10,467 --> 00:13:13,027
The drive up there was brutal,
remember?

208
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:15,730
- We might get a decent camping spot
this year, which would be amazing.

209
00:13:15,872 --> 00:13:18,966
- I don't know, there's supposed to be
like twice as many people this year.

210
00:13:19,109 --> 00:13:20,906
- How 'bout you relax,
there's going to be room.

211
00:13:21,044 --> 00:13:22,671
- Hey, that's what you said last year.

212
00:13:22,813 --> 00:13:23,973
- So?

213
00:13:24,114 --> 00:13:26,173
- So, we ended up sleeping in a ditch.

214
00:13:26,316 --> 00:13:28,443
- That's funny because
I don't remember being in a ditch.

215
00:13:28,585 --> 00:13:31,611
- I'm surprised you remember
your name after all that tequila.

216
00:13:32,122 --> 00:13:33,919
- Ah, yeah.

217
00:13:39,896 --> 00:13:42,330
- How many times have you done this?
- You mean soloed?

218
00:13:42,466 --> 00:13:44,593
- Yeah, no instructor,
no co-pilot, just you.

219
00:13:44,734 --> 00:13:48,135
- Plenty. You need a lot of hours
before they let you fly a twin.

220
00:13:48,271 --> 00:13:52,139
- How about in this plane,
how many times in this plane?

221
00:13:52,275 --> 00:13:55,073
- Well, never, because it's a rental.
- No, you know what I mean,

222
00:13:55,212 --> 00:13:57,203
like this type of plane.
- Enough.

223
00:13:58,448 --> 00:14:00,746
Okay? Enough.

224
00:14:03,286 --> 00:14:04,412
- Whoa!

225
00:14:05,789 --> 00:14:07,723
Look what we got here, huh?

226
00:14:07,858 --> 00:14:09,291
- Is that what I think it is?

227
00:14:09,426 --> 00:14:10,893
- Whoooaa!
Yeah! It's a parachute!

228
00:14:11,027 --> 00:14:13,222
If anything happens,
we got this, right?

229
00:14:13,363 --> 00:14:16,127
Whoooo!
Bail out, bail out!

230
00:14:16,266 --> 00:14:17,824
- Be careful with that.

231
00:14:17,968 --> 00:14:19,595
- Alright, alright, just playing.

232
00:14:19,736 --> 00:14:21,533
- Well, play with something else.

233
00:14:21,671 --> 00:14:22,933
- Oh, okay.
You like that shit?

234
00:14:23,073 --> 00:14:26,668
- Don't encourage him.
- Oh yeah.

235
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:28,209
- Very good.

236
00:14:28,945 --> 00:14:30,879
- Yankee Zulu X-ray,
cleared for takeoff, one five left,

237
00:14:31,047 --> 00:14:32,480
to 1000 feet,

238
00:14:32,616 --> 00:14:33,605
one niner decimal one.

239
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:36,548
- Yankee Zulu X-ray,
cleared for takeoff, one five left.

240
00:14:38,088 --> 00:14:40,318
Okay, here we go,
buckle up back there.

241
00:14:40,457 --> 00:14:41,947
- Whooo!

242
00:14:42,092 --> 00:14:45,061
- Please insert tab into buckle.

243
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:49,997
- Okay line-ups, cowl flaps open,

244
00:14:50,133 --> 00:14:52,328
mixture rich, props forward.

245
00:14:52,469 --> 00:14:54,937
Transponder alt, lights on,

246
00:14:55,071 --> 00:14:56,902
fuel pumps on,

247
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,940
DG set,

248
00:14:59,075 --> 00:15:00,804
power set.

249
00:15:04,114 --> 00:15:05,479
- Whooo!

250
00:15:05,615 --> 00:15:07,139
- Hey!
- Let's do it, ha!

251
00:15:07,284 --> 00:15:08,842
- That's so not okay.
- Whoooo!

252
00:15:08,985 --> 00:15:11,920
- Gauges green.
Air speed alive.

253
00:15:24,467 --> 00:15:27,027
- Whooo!
- 85 knots.

254
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:28,603
85 rotate.
- Yeah!

255
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:30,199
- Whooooo!

256
00:15:55,398 --> 00:15:58,196
- After takeoff checks, fuel pumps off,

257
00:15:58,335 --> 00:16:00,030
engine gauges green.

258
00:16:04,874 --> 00:16:06,637
Beautiful, isn't it.

259
00:16:18,655 --> 00:16:20,714
- Wow, Sara, this is amazing.

260
00:16:26,263 --> 00:16:27,491
- Seriously?

261
00:16:27,664 --> 00:16:29,928
- That was fucking disgusting.

262
00:16:30,767 --> 00:16:34,601
- If you puke in here,
you are sleeping alone tonight.

263
00:16:34,738 --> 00:16:36,467
- That's an empty threat.

264
00:16:37,807 --> 00:16:40,469
- That's what happens
when you drink and fly, kids.

265
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:43,010
I don't recommend it, do you?

266
00:16:44,447 --> 00:16:46,608
- Yankee Zulu X-ray,
Harrisford V.O.R.

267
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,878
out of 2,200 for 5,500
en route to Green Lake.

268
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,716
- Yankee Zulu X-ray,
squawk 5247 and ident,

269
00:16:52,856 --> 00:16:54,414
cleared 5,500.

270
00:16:54,557 --> 00:16:58,857
- Yankee Zulu X-ray,
squawk 5247 cleared 5,500.

271
00:16:58,995 --> 00:17:00,929
- Yankee Zulu X-ray,
you're radar identified,

272
00:17:01,097 --> 00:17:03,657
Green Lake altimeter
is two niner, eight niner...

273
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:05,027
- Yankee Zulu X-ray, roger.

274
00:17:05,168 --> 00:17:06,294
- What's happening?

275
00:17:06,436 --> 00:17:10,236
- Um, I just told them who we are
and what we want to do

276
00:17:10,373 --> 00:17:12,603
and they assigned us
a new transponder code

277
00:17:12,742 --> 00:17:13,936
so radar can identify us.

278
00:17:14,077 --> 00:17:17,740
It's all routine,
there's nothing to worry about.

279
00:17:18,948 --> 00:17:21,746
- So Sara, what's with you
taking the train to McGill?

280
00:17:21,885 --> 00:17:22,943
- It was my dad's idea,

281
00:17:23,086 --> 00:17:25,714
he thought I could see more
of the country that way.

282
00:17:26,356 --> 00:17:28,881
- Do you still need a ride
at the ass crack of dawn?

283
00:17:29,025 --> 00:17:31,357
- No, it's okay, I've got it covered.

284
00:17:32,495 --> 00:17:36,693
- Um... actually my dad
really wanted to see me off,

285
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:38,425
so I told him he could drive.

286
00:17:41,404 --> 00:17:43,201
- Whatever, just let me know.

287
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:49,274
- Yeah, but I thought that...

288
00:17:52,182 --> 00:17:53,615
Never mind.

289
00:17:58,121 --> 00:18:00,112
- Someone take this, take it.

290
00:18:07,464 --> 00:18:08,761
- Ah, great.

291
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:11,361
This thing always gets out of tune.

292
00:18:12,702 --> 00:18:15,000
- Tune it up.
- What are you doing?

293
00:18:15,138 --> 00:18:16,696
- Filming you.

294
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,864
- Yeah, I can see that.

295
00:18:18,007 --> 00:18:19,372
- Right...

296
00:18:19,542 --> 00:18:22,170
- So you gonna shoot that video
for my band or what?

297
00:18:22,312 --> 00:18:23,939
- It depends,
do I still get final cut?

298
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,207
- Whatever you want,
as long as it got hoes in it.

299
00:18:26,349 --> 00:18:28,544
- Classy, I like it.

300
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:32,386
Speaking of hoes,
how's the love life?

301
00:18:32,522 --> 00:18:35,047
- Whoa, getting a little personal,
don't you think?

302
00:18:35,191 --> 00:18:37,682
- Come on, you can tell me.
Anybody special?

303
00:18:37,827 --> 00:18:39,351
- There might be.
- It's a dude.

304
00:18:39,496 --> 00:18:40,963
- Oh yeah?

305
00:18:41,097 --> 00:18:42,064
Anybody we know?

306
00:18:42,198 --> 00:18:45,690
- Um... I'd better not say.

307
00:18:45,835 --> 00:18:47,393
- Why not?

308
00:18:47,537 --> 00:18:49,300
- She's got a boyfriend.

309
00:18:50,807 --> 00:18:52,035
- Funny guy...

310
00:18:53,777 --> 00:18:55,176
Funny guy.

311
00:19:09,993 --> 00:19:12,120
- Shouldn't you keep your hands
on the wheel?

312
00:19:13,563 --> 00:19:15,724
- It's okay, that's what
the rudder pedals are for.

313
00:19:23,673 --> 00:19:25,436
- You forget something?

314
00:19:25,575 --> 00:19:28,305
- No, just making sure
my gift's not getting crushed.

315
00:19:28,445 --> 00:19:31,005
You brought it?

316
00:19:31,181 --> 00:19:33,115
- Of course I did.
- What gift?

317
00:19:33,249 --> 00:19:34,876
- Just a little something.

318
00:19:35,018 --> 00:19:38,010
- Oh yeah, what'd you get him,
a personality or something?

319
00:19:38,154 --> 00:19:39,212
- Show us.

320
00:19:39,355 --> 00:19:41,448
- Nah, it's just a... comic book.

321
00:19:41,591 --> 00:19:43,991
- The guy at the store said
it was pretty rare...

322
00:19:44,127 --> 00:19:45,788
and since Bruce was a collector.

323
00:19:45,929 --> 00:19:47,897
- A comic book?

324
00:19:48,031 --> 00:19:49,123
You're one of those guys.

325
00:19:49,265 --> 00:19:50,857
- What is that supposed to mean?

326
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,661
- Nothing, buddy,
come on, let me see it.

327
00:19:52,802 --> 00:19:54,702
- Yeah, come on.

328
00:19:54,838 --> 00:19:56,135
- Come on, let me see it.

329
00:19:56,272 --> 00:19:58,570
- You can't right now,
because he is flying the plane.

330
00:19:58,708 --> 00:19:59,800
- Whoa.
- Sara.

331
00:19:59,943 --> 00:20:02,377
- Sara, can you please stop
screwing around with this guy.

332
00:20:02,512 --> 00:20:04,480
That'd be great.
- Our lives are in his hands.

333
00:20:04,614 --> 00:20:06,673
- Just, just relax, okay?
She knows what she's doing.

334
00:20:07,817 --> 00:20:09,682
- You're doing fine. See?

335
00:20:09,819 --> 00:20:12,117
It's not that hard.

336
00:20:12,455 --> 00:20:14,446
- Woo, jeez!

337
00:20:16,493 --> 00:20:17,824
- Shit! Shit!

338
00:20:17,994 --> 00:20:20,360
- I think we get the point now,
take back the controls,

339
00:20:20,497 --> 00:20:21,794
please, Sara!

340
00:20:21,931 --> 00:20:23,694
- Just a little bit of turbulence.
Pull back slowly.

341
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:25,460
- I can't!
- Pull back slowly.

342
00:20:25,602 --> 00:20:26,626
- I can't.

343
00:20:31,574 --> 00:20:34,168
- Sara, this isn't funny anymore, okay?
- Come on, pull back.

344
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:37,108
- I think we'd all be more comfortable
with Sara flying the plane.

345
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:39,442
- Hey, Sara, come on, huh!

346
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:50,790
- Jesus, Sara, God.

347
00:20:51,394 --> 00:20:53,021
- Next time I wanna be in front.

348
00:20:53,162 --> 00:20:55,630
- Are you alright?

349
00:20:55,765 --> 00:20:57,357
- Fuck this shit, gimme this!

350
00:20:58,268 --> 00:20:59,929
- Hey!
- Sal! Come on.

351
00:21:00,069 --> 00:21:01,798
- What you gonna do, punk, huh?

352
00:21:01,938 --> 00:21:04,031
Oh, I'm sorry, is this yours?

353
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,903
Oooo, Weird Stories.

354
00:21:06,042 --> 00:21:07,703
Oooo, creepy!

355
00:21:07,844 --> 00:21:09,402
- Dude, d'you mind?
- Guys.

356
00:21:09,546 --> 00:21:10,945
- You want it?
- Give it back.

357
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,513
- Be careful!
- Take it easy, guys.

358
00:21:12,649 --> 00:21:15,049
- Careful, careful, it's a comic book.

359
00:21:15,184 --> 00:21:16,651
- Sal, just give it back.

360
00:21:16,786 --> 00:21:20,415
- Oh my God, I'm taking it out
of its protective case thing...

361
00:21:20,557 --> 00:21:22,787
Oh my God...

362
00:21:22,926 --> 00:21:24,450
great condition.
- Sal.

363
00:21:24,594 --> 00:21:26,721
- You're so not funny, stop it.

364
00:21:26,863 --> 00:21:28,524
- Dude.
- Oh... it's ripping...

365
00:21:31,034 --> 00:21:32,558
- Sal, what are you doing?

366
00:21:32,702 --> 00:21:37,639
- Oh my God, this looks
pretty important to the story.

367
00:21:37,774 --> 00:21:39,207
- Seriously?

368
00:21:39,275 --> 00:21:40,970
- Ah!

369
00:21:42,879 --> 00:21:45,575
- What are you, seven years old,
reading comics?

370
00:21:45,715 --> 00:21:47,706
The next time
you try and get us killed,

371
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:49,215
I'm wiping my whole ass with it.

372
00:21:49,352 --> 00:21:51,047
- Hey, Sal, that's enough!

373
00:21:51,187 --> 00:21:52,779
Okay, just give it back to him.

374
00:21:52,922 --> 00:21:54,219
- Fucking little kid,
still reading comics.

375
00:21:54,357 --> 00:21:56,188
- Give it to him!
- You want your comic?

376
00:21:56,326 --> 00:21:58,624
You want your comic?
Take your fucking comic!

377
00:21:58,761 --> 00:21:59,921
- Come on, Sal.

378
00:22:03,232 --> 00:22:04,824
- It's okay.

379
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,332
- What's that?

380
00:22:12,475 --> 00:22:13,635
- It's a...

381
00:22:13,776 --> 00:22:15,835
a bus ticket to Montreal.

382
00:22:19,682 --> 00:22:22,207
- Montreal, isn't that
where you're moving, Sara?

383
00:22:26,956 --> 00:22:28,651
Sorry, man.

384
00:22:35,131 --> 00:22:36,792
- I was gonna tell you.

385
00:22:38,501 --> 00:22:40,162
- When exactly where you going
to tell me?

386
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:42,194
- Um...

387
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,999
- We'll talk about this later.

388
00:22:52,582 --> 00:22:54,846
Centre, Yankee Zulu X-ray.
- Yankee Zulu X-ray.

389
00:22:54,984 --> 00:22:57,782
- Yankee Zulu X-ray requesting
10,500 for weather.

390
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:01,151
- Yankee Zulu X-ray,
you're cleared at 10,500,

391
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:03,155
negative traffic.

392
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:05,390
- Hey, what's going on?

393
00:23:05,528 --> 00:23:09,259
- Um, we've got weather ahead
and I'm not instrument rated.

394
00:23:09,399 --> 00:23:11,094
So we'll have to climb above it.

395
00:23:11,234 --> 00:23:13,168
- Whoa, what does
'not instrument rated' mean?

396
00:23:13,302 --> 00:23:15,202
- It means I have to visually
maintain separation

397
00:23:15,338 --> 00:23:16,805
from the ground at all times.

398
00:23:16,939 --> 00:23:19,806
- Translation, it means,
she can't fly through clouds.

399
00:23:19,976 --> 00:23:22,911
- Clouds.
Are you kidding me?

400
00:23:23,046 --> 00:23:24,638
- Will you shut up?

401
00:23:44,967 --> 00:23:46,730
- How high does this thing go,
anyway?

402
00:23:46,903 --> 00:23:49,872
- Service ceiling is 24,000.

403
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:51,666
- 24,000...

404
00:23:51,841 --> 00:23:55,333
- Look at it this way,
commercial airlines fly at 40.

405
00:23:56,813 --> 00:24:00,010
Sorry about that, guys.
It's just a little bit of unsettled air.

406
00:24:00,149 --> 00:24:03,050
- Unsettled air?
- It's the third time.

407
00:24:05,655 --> 00:24:06,986
- 10,000...

408
00:24:11,761 --> 00:24:13,456
- Aren't we supposed
to level off or something?

409
00:24:13,629 --> 00:24:16,325
- I'm trying.
- What you mean, you're trying?

410
00:24:16,466 --> 00:24:18,457
- It means, I'm trying.

411
00:24:23,806 --> 00:24:25,467
- Quit screwing around, Sara!
- This isn't a joke!

412
00:24:25,641 --> 00:24:27,438
The elevator's not responding
for some reason.

413
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:29,339
- There's an elevator?
- Not that kind of elevator!

414
00:24:29,479 --> 00:24:32,346
- You see that part on the tail
that's sticking up at an angle?

415
00:24:32,482 --> 00:24:34,177
- Which part?
- The hinged section

416
00:24:34,317 --> 00:24:35,341
- Yes.

417
00:24:35,485 --> 00:24:38,852
- When air goes over it,
the tail goes down, making us go up.

418
00:24:39,021 --> 00:24:40,921
I don't, I don't know,
something's jammed it.

419
00:24:41,057 --> 00:24:42,991
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Come on.

420
00:24:43,693 --> 00:24:45,752
- What do we do?
- Mel, put the camera away!

421
00:24:46,562 --> 00:24:47,551
Ten minutes!

422
00:24:47,697 --> 00:24:50,632
- Centre, Yankee Zulu X-ray, I, uh,
I think I have a problem here.

423
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,360
- Yankee Zulu X-ray, Centre,
are you declaring an emergency?

424
00:24:53,536 --> 00:24:55,766
- Yankee Zulu X-ray... uh...

425
00:24:57,006 --> 00:24:58,667
Not at this time.
- Not at this time?

426
00:24:58,808 --> 00:25:00,469
I thought you said we couldn't level off!

427
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:03,306
- No, there are procedures for this.
Okay, I'll just reduce power.

428
00:25:03,479 --> 00:25:04,810
- You should tell him that then, Sara.

429
00:25:04,981 --> 00:25:07,415
- Hey!
Who's the pilot here?

430
00:25:07,583 --> 00:25:09,551
Everyone just relax, okay?

431
00:25:22,698 --> 00:25:23,630
- Oh no.

432
00:25:42,552 --> 00:25:44,144
- Oh, shit.

433
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,420
- We should probably turn around.
Turn this thing around.

434
00:25:46,589 --> 00:25:48,523
- Sara, we need to go back!
Let's turn around, now!

435
00:25:48,658 --> 00:25:49,852
- Yeah.

436
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,765
What the hell?

437
00:26:26,996 --> 00:26:28,861
- This is bad.

438
00:26:28,998 --> 00:26:30,522
I'm pretty sure this is bad.

439
00:26:48,217 --> 00:26:50,651
- Everybody just stay calm, okay?

440
00:26:53,823 --> 00:26:55,290
20,000...?

441
00:26:55,725 --> 00:26:57,386
That's impossible.

442
00:26:58,327 --> 00:27:00,591
- 20,000 feet?
Is that right?

443
00:27:00,763 --> 00:27:02,628
- Can't be, there must be
some kind of glitch.

444
00:27:05,835 --> 00:27:07,996
Centre, Yankee Zulu X-ray,
my elevator's jammed

445
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:09,603
and my instruments are malfunctioning,

446
00:27:09,739 --> 00:27:12,970
I am climbing and have lost position
in cloud, please advise.

447
00:27:14,043 --> 00:27:15,567
Centre, Yankee Zulu X-ray!!!

448
00:27:15,745 --> 00:27:17,736
- Hey, what the hell is going on?

449
00:27:18,281 --> 00:27:19,771
- I can't raise anybody.

450
00:27:19,916 --> 00:27:22,350
- What do you mean
you can't raise anybody?

451
00:27:22,485 --> 00:27:25,545
- Mayday, mayday, mayday,
Yankee Zulu X-ray,

452
00:27:25,688 --> 00:27:28,020
approximately 15 miles
east of Patterson V.O.R.

453
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:32,183
Altitude unknown, instrument failure,
please respond.

454
00:27:33,329 --> 00:27:36,389
Mayday, mayday, mayday,
Yankee Zulu X-ray!!

455
00:27:43,873 --> 00:27:45,033
- Sara?

456
00:27:47,276 --> 00:27:48,641
Sara?

457
00:27:48,778 --> 00:27:50,541
- No one is answering.

458
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,204
There's nothing.

459
00:27:52,348 --> 00:27:55,613
Just dead air.
- Jesus Christ.

460
00:27:55,751 --> 00:27:56,740
- So what do we do?

461
00:27:56,886 --> 00:27:58,854
- I don't know.

462
00:27:59,021 --> 00:28:00,955
- You don't know?
You're the pilot!

463
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:03,149
Get us out of this!
- What about the procedures?

464
00:28:03,292 --> 00:28:06,386
You said you wanted to reduce power?
- I can't risk it now, visibility is zero

465
00:28:06,562 --> 00:28:09,929
and without instruments, we could fly
straight into a mountain.

466
00:28:10,099 --> 00:28:12,397
- Hey, what did you do?

467
00:28:12,535 --> 00:28:14,332
Huh? You let him fly the plane.

468
00:28:14,503 --> 00:28:16,971
He probably fucked something up.
- He didn't do anything!

469
00:28:17,139 --> 00:28:18,800
- Yeah, well somebody did!

470
00:28:18,975 --> 00:28:20,806
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
you know he's right.

471
00:28:20,977 --> 00:28:24,413
This is your fault Sara.
- This is not my fault!

472
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:27,549
- How long have you had your license?
- Long enough.

473
00:28:27,683 --> 00:28:30,345
- You only checked out on one
of these things like a week ago?

474
00:28:30,519 --> 00:28:32,851
Jesus Christ, I can't believe
I was stupid enough--

475
00:28:32,989 --> 00:28:35,423
- Sal! Will you just calm down?
You're not helping.

476
00:28:35,958 --> 00:28:38,358
- Maybe I missed something
during the pre-flight, I don't know.

477
00:28:38,494 --> 00:28:41,520
- You missed something?!
- We need to contact traffic control.

478
00:28:41,664 --> 00:28:45,600
If they still have a radar fix on us,
they can talk us down.

479
00:28:46,469 --> 00:28:48,869
Cell phones,
does anyone have a signal?

480
00:28:50,473 --> 00:28:53,203
- No. Wait, wait...

481
00:28:54,076 --> 00:28:55,600
Fuck, I got nothing.

482
00:28:55,778 --> 00:28:57,336
- Same here.

483
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,708
- Oh, think.

484
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:02,617
Something's wrong, we're stalling.

485
00:29:02,752 --> 00:29:05,312
I have to go to maximum power.

486
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:08,582
Bruce?

487
00:29:08,924 --> 00:29:10,289
Bruce! Goddamn it!

488
00:29:11,827 --> 00:29:13,658
There's a pilot operating handbook
underneath the seat,

489
00:29:13,796 --> 00:29:15,354
can you give it to me?
Please.

490
00:29:15,498 --> 00:29:17,557
- I thought you knew
how to fly this thing?

491
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,827
- Just give it to me, please.
Give it to me!

492
00:29:25,408 --> 00:29:26,397
Go to section five.

493
00:29:29,445 --> 00:29:30,412
- Now what?

494
00:29:30,546 --> 00:29:32,946
- The maximum takeoff weight,
it should say somewhere.

495
00:29:33,449 --> 00:29:35,007
- Uh... 6,500.

496
00:29:35,184 --> 00:29:37,414
- Okay, if we're over that,
the stall speed will change.

497
00:29:37,553 --> 00:29:39,646
What's the basic empty weight?

498
00:29:39,789 --> 00:29:41,882
- Uh, 4891.
- Sal, how much do you weigh?

499
00:29:42,191 --> 00:29:44,159
- What?
- How much?

500
00:29:44,527 --> 00:29:45,892
- Uh, 170, why?

501
00:29:46,062 --> 00:29:48,087
- Mel?
- 110.

502
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:50,562
- 155.
- Bruce?

503
00:29:50,699 --> 00:29:53,167
Bruce, please!
- Uh, 150.

504
00:29:53,335 --> 00:29:55,997
- Okay, I'm 110,
plus a 100 for baggage.

505
00:29:56,172 --> 00:29:58,538
1,000 for fuel. Um...

506
00:29:58,674 --> 00:30:00,073
- 1,800.

507
00:30:00,242 --> 00:30:01,869
- 1,800?

508
00:30:02,645 --> 00:30:05,239
We're too heavy. We should get rid
of anything we don't need.

509
00:30:05,414 --> 00:30:07,075
- You kidding me?
- I look like I'm kidding?

510
00:30:07,216 --> 00:30:09,013
- I'm not throwing
my stuff out of the plane.

511
00:30:09,185 --> 00:30:10,482
- I'll do it for you.

512
00:30:10,619 --> 00:30:11,881
- Sal! No!

513
00:30:12,021 --> 00:30:14,285
No!
- Sit down!

514
00:30:14,423 --> 00:30:15,754
- You want me to open the hatch?

515
00:30:15,925 --> 00:30:17,893
- Be careful... please.

516
00:30:18,027 --> 00:30:19,426
- You know I will.

517
00:30:19,595 --> 00:30:20,619
Are you guys ready?
- Yeah.

518
00:30:20,763 --> 00:30:22,560
I know, I got you, I got you.

519
00:30:22,698 --> 00:30:24,256
- Got me?
- Alright, I'm opening.

520
00:30:25,067 --> 00:30:26,967
- Be careful back there.
- Ready?

521
00:30:27,103 --> 00:30:29,037
One... two... three!

522
00:30:31,574 --> 00:30:33,201
- I got you.
- I'm good, I'm good.

523
00:30:33,342 --> 00:30:35,776
- Are you ready?
- Can't keep this thing in tune anyway.

524
00:30:35,911 --> 00:30:37,071
- And you play like shit.

525
00:30:41,584 --> 00:30:42,949
- What's next?

526
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:46,588
- You got it, you got it?
- What's next?

527
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:53,285
Your bag, I'll get the other one.

528
00:30:54,864 --> 00:30:56,764
- What the fuck?

529
00:30:56,899 --> 00:30:58,924
- What is it?
What's going on?

530
00:30:59,068 --> 00:31:01,195
- Sal, what's wrong with you?

531
00:31:01,337 --> 00:31:02,929
- I just, I just saw something.

532
00:31:03,105 --> 00:31:04,402
- What?
- I don't know!

533
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:05,632
- Guys!
- I need you, okay?

534
00:31:05,808 --> 00:31:08,038
- Focus!
- I know, I know!

535
00:31:08,177 --> 00:31:10,668
- Uh... I think that's it.
- Okay, you're next, go!

536
00:31:10,813 --> 00:31:13,976
- What are you holding out on us?
- Look man, that stays, alright?

537
00:31:14,116 --> 00:31:16,414
- Alright, well I'm keeping
something too, huh?

538
00:31:18,521 --> 00:31:19,613
- That's it, come on!

539
00:31:29,632 --> 00:31:30,894
- Is it better?

540
00:31:31,033 --> 00:31:34,002
- Maybe, uh, I don't know.

541
00:31:34,303 --> 00:31:35,793
This doesn't make sense.

542
00:31:35,938 --> 00:31:38,566
The systems aren't supposed
to fail like this.

543
00:31:40,709 --> 00:31:42,040
- So how long do we have?

544
00:31:46,315 --> 00:31:47,976
Sara.

545
00:31:54,156 --> 00:31:55,885
Sara, how long do we have?

546
00:32:04,833 --> 00:32:07,597
- We'll be out of fuel
in less than an hour.

547
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:20,180
- What are you saying?

548
00:32:20,349 --> 00:32:23,512
- When we took off,
the tanks were only half full.

549
00:32:37,933 --> 00:32:40,561
- We're going to draw straws,

550
00:32:40,736 --> 00:32:42,328
and the winner gets the parachute.

551
00:32:50,512 --> 00:32:52,480
- Oh, come on.

552
00:32:52,648 --> 00:32:54,513
- It's a good idea.
- What?

553
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:55,742
- He's right.

554
00:32:55,884 --> 00:32:57,909
- I can't believe
you're even talking about this.

555
00:32:58,053 --> 00:33:00,920
- You guys, it's too dangerous.
- Too dangerous?

556
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:03,251
- Is that a joke?

557
00:33:03,425 --> 00:33:06,292
- We don't know who put that chute here,
or if it's packed properly.

558
00:33:06,428 --> 00:33:09,556
None of us have even skydived before!
- Well how hard can it be?

559
00:33:09,698 --> 00:33:11,962
- We could be at 10,000 feet,
or at 1,000.

560
00:33:12,101 --> 00:33:14,365
You jump when we're too low,
you're gonna hit the ground

561
00:33:14,536 --> 00:33:17,198
before your chute opens,
if it even opens.

562
00:33:17,373 --> 00:33:18,670
Are you crazy?
- Too low?

563
00:33:18,807 --> 00:33:20,707
We've been going up the whole time.
- Have we?

564
00:33:21,777 --> 00:33:24,405
The first thing they teach you
at flight school is just

565
00:33:24,546 --> 00:33:26,980
how disoriented you get
when you can't see the ground.

566
00:33:27,149 --> 00:33:29,743
There's no way
that we're putting that on.

567
00:33:29,918 --> 00:33:32,148
There's no way.

568
00:33:38,894 --> 00:33:41,556
- You know what? Screw this.
Mel, take it.

569
00:33:41,697 --> 00:33:43,995
- What are you doing?
- You're putting it on.

570
00:33:44,133 --> 00:33:47,261
- What are you doing, man?
- I'm saving her life, man.

571
00:33:47,436 --> 00:33:48,596
Take it.

572
00:33:48,737 --> 00:33:50,898
- Hey, back off, Cory.

573
00:33:51,073 --> 00:33:52,973
- No.
- I'm not going to let you die.

574
00:33:53,108 --> 00:33:57,272
- Look man, I said back off,
we're drawing straws like I said before.

575
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:00,575
- She's your girlfriend, man.
What, you're going to let her die?

576
00:34:00,749 --> 00:34:04,685
- Yeah, she's my girlfriend.

577
00:34:04,853 --> 00:34:07,344
I'm gonna decide.
- Decide what?

578
00:34:18,734 --> 00:34:21,430
- God, you're a fucking asshole,
you know that?

579
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:24,471
- Oh yeah, I'm the asshole here, right?

580
00:34:25,541 --> 00:34:27,668
- Stop it! Quit it!

581
00:34:27,843 --> 00:34:30,175
- What the hell is going on
back there?

582
00:34:30,346 --> 00:34:32,314
- Stop it!

583
00:34:32,481 --> 00:34:34,381
Both of you, stop it!

584
00:34:38,987 --> 00:34:41,285
- That the best you got, man?

585
00:34:41,457 --> 00:34:43,391
That what they teach you in school?

586
00:34:43,525 --> 00:34:45,425
- Fuck off man, fuck off.

587
00:34:46,795 --> 00:34:48,285
- No wonder you lost
every wrestling match.

588
00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:50,398
- Fuck you!
I didn't lose every match.

589
00:34:53,569 --> 00:34:54,729
- Shit.

590
00:35:00,876 --> 00:35:02,366
- Un-fucking-believable.
Gimme that!

591
00:35:02,511 --> 00:35:03,569
- Stop!
- No!

592
00:35:03,712 --> 00:35:04,770
- Gimme.
- Let go!

593
00:35:04,947 --> 00:35:07,177
- Leave her alone!
- Stop it!

594
00:35:07,349 --> 00:35:09,715
Everybody, stop it!

595
00:35:09,852 --> 00:35:13,015
Do you want to get out of this alive?

596
00:35:13,155 --> 00:35:14,952
Do you?

597
00:35:15,124 --> 00:35:17,649
Do you want to get out of this alive?

598
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,627
Well then I'm the pilot
and what I say goes.

599
00:35:20,763 --> 00:35:22,788
Is that acceptable to you?

600
00:35:24,299 --> 00:35:26,699
Is that acceptable, yes or no?

601
00:35:26,835 --> 00:35:28,564
Is that acceptable?

602
00:35:33,409 --> 00:35:35,070
Good.

603
00:35:35,244 --> 00:35:37,474
Everyone just stay in your seat
and shut up.

604
00:35:42,017 --> 00:35:43,416
- We're going to die like them.

605
00:35:49,258 --> 00:35:51,089
We're going to die like them.

606
00:35:53,395 --> 00:35:55,090
- What do you mean?

607
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:57,494
- We're going to die like them.
We have to get down.

608
00:35:57,633 --> 00:36:00,625
- Bruce, we're all scared, okay?
Just take it easy.

609
00:36:00,769 --> 00:36:02,168
- No, we have to land the plane.

610
00:36:03,572 --> 00:36:05,403
We have to get the plane down.

611
00:36:06,308 --> 00:36:09,709
- Just relax.
- No, we have to get me down.

612
00:36:09,845 --> 00:36:12,075
We have to get down!
We have to get down!

613
00:36:13,715 --> 00:36:15,615
We have to get me down!
Get me down!

614
00:36:15,784 --> 00:36:17,718
Get me down!
- No!

615
00:36:17,853 --> 00:36:20,185
- No!
- No!

616
00:36:21,156 --> 00:36:22,885
- I'm not gonna die like them!

617
00:36:23,058 --> 00:36:25,458
I'm not gonna die like them!

618
00:36:25,627 --> 00:36:28,687
- Relax alright!
Just relax.

619
00:36:28,864 --> 00:36:31,594
There we go, there we go.
Just relax.

620
00:36:33,101 --> 00:36:34,568
- Sal, what are you doing?

621
00:36:36,171 --> 00:36:38,765
- There we go. There it is.

622
00:36:46,915 --> 00:36:49,213
- Who's flying the plane?
- The autopilot.

623
00:36:49,384 --> 00:36:50,373
- Is he breathing?

624
00:36:50,519 --> 00:36:52,350
- He'll be fine,
I just put him to sleep.

625
00:36:52,488 --> 00:36:54,683
- What was all that shit he said
about people dying?

626
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:57,750
- His parents died in a car accident.
- Are you sure?

627
00:36:57,893 --> 00:37:00,259
- You know, if he's so afraid of flying,
why'd he come?

628
00:37:00,395 --> 00:37:01,589
- Because I invited him.

629
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:03,630
- You know what?
That's right, I forgot.

630
00:37:03,765 --> 00:37:05,733
He's a freak and he's in love.

631
00:37:05,868 --> 00:37:07,768
- We're not in love.

632
00:37:08,637 --> 00:37:10,798
- Yeah?
Does he know that?

633
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,273
What are you gonna do?

634
00:37:13,442 --> 00:37:17,435
One last weekend of pity sex with him
and trash him like a leaky rubber?

635
00:37:18,046 --> 00:37:19,673
Is that what you're gonna do?

636
00:37:19,815 --> 00:37:22,249
That's cold.
That's cold, sweetie.

637
00:37:22,351 --> 00:37:26,788
- You don't know a thing about me
or what I want.

638
00:37:27,589 --> 00:37:28,954
- Yeah, whatever.

639
00:37:31,159 --> 00:37:32,626
We better tie him up.

640
00:37:32,761 --> 00:37:34,388
- Tie him up?

641
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:36,225
Isn't that a bit extreme?

642
00:37:36,365 --> 00:37:39,630
- You want him to go all kamikaze
on us again, huh?

643
00:37:42,237 --> 00:37:43,534
- You got a blade, man?

644
00:38:01,823 --> 00:38:03,415
- Alright.

645
00:38:03,659 --> 00:38:06,025
- Ah!
- Sara.

646
00:38:07,129 --> 00:38:10,189
It's getting really cold in here, Sara.

647
00:38:10,365 --> 00:38:12,526
- I'm sorry,
this cabin isn't pressurized.

648
00:38:12,668 --> 00:38:15,296
- Isn't there a heater?
- Yeah, there is, but we can't use it.

649
00:38:16,171 --> 00:38:19,140
- Why?
- It runs on the main fuel supply

650
00:38:19,274 --> 00:38:21,139
and we need every last drop
for the engines.

651
00:38:21,276 --> 00:38:23,904
Oxygen is the real problem.

652
00:38:24,947 --> 00:38:26,244
- What do you mean?

653
00:38:26,381 --> 00:38:30,317
- Above 13,000 feet, we're going
to start suffering from apoxia.

654
00:38:30,452 --> 00:38:33,046
- Apoxia, what's apoxia?
- It's, uh, oxygen deprivation.

655
00:38:33,188 --> 00:38:35,656
Shortness of breath,
headaches, nausea.

656
00:38:35,824 --> 00:38:38,156
- I thought you said this thing
could go to 24,000 feet.

657
00:38:38,293 --> 00:38:40,284
- It can, but most people
don't bring it above 10.

658
00:38:40,429 --> 00:38:42,192
That's why there's no breathing gear.

659
00:38:42,331 --> 00:38:45,494
Dammit! If my elevator worked,
I could do a controlled descent

660
00:38:45,667 --> 00:38:47,760
and we could all get our bearings.

661
00:38:48,437 --> 00:38:51,873
- Is there a way that we can clear
the jam, like an access panel, or...

662
00:38:52,007 --> 00:38:54,168
- There's nothing we can do from here.

663
00:38:54,309 --> 00:38:57,506
Somebody would have to go outside
and do it manually.

664
00:38:58,647 --> 00:39:00,911
- What do you mean go outside?
On the tail?

665
00:39:13,328 --> 00:39:15,956
- No, no, no.
Screw that, we're not doing that.

666
00:39:16,098 --> 00:39:17,122
It's ridiculous.

667
00:39:17,265 --> 00:39:19,495
- That's your attitude for everything,
isn't it? Just give up.

668
00:39:19,635 --> 00:39:21,125
- What, do you wanna go out there?

669
00:39:21,269 --> 00:39:22,600
Huh?

670
00:39:22,738 --> 00:39:25,138
Be my guest.

671
00:39:45,594 --> 00:39:47,255
- Oh no...

672
00:39:49,064 --> 00:39:50,361
- What now?

673
00:39:50,499 --> 00:39:52,626
- The de-icing boots are malfunctioning.

674
00:39:52,768 --> 00:39:53,757
- What?

675
00:39:53,902 --> 00:39:56,632
- They keep ice
from building up on the wings.

676
00:39:56,772 --> 00:39:58,672
- Aren't you supposed to check
all this shit before--?

677
00:39:58,807 --> 00:40:01,002
- I didn't know we were going
to be flying this high.

678
00:40:01,143 --> 00:40:02,735
- So ice builds up,
what does that mean?

679
00:40:02,878 --> 00:40:05,403
- It means we don't generate
enough lift.

680
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:08,708
And if it blocks the ailerons
then we're really screwed.

681
00:40:08,884 --> 00:40:10,647
- Oh, perfect.

682
00:40:12,721 --> 00:40:15,087
- Mel, what's wrong, you okay?

683
00:40:15,223 --> 00:40:16,781
- Just a... headache.

684
00:40:20,862 --> 00:40:22,796
What are you doing?

685
00:40:22,931 --> 00:40:24,694
- You heard her,
we just ran out of options.

686
00:40:25,267 --> 00:40:28,498
- Cory, you're not going out there.
- Beats sitting in here waiting to die.

687
00:40:28,637 --> 00:40:30,628
- No, Cory, you can't go out there.

688
00:40:30,772 --> 00:40:32,637
Nothing to hang onto,
you'll be blown right off.

689
00:40:32,774 --> 00:40:33,934
- That's what the rope's for.

690
00:40:34,076 --> 00:40:36,476
- Listen to her okay?
She knows what she's talking about.

691
00:40:38,313 --> 00:40:41,339
- Look, take this with you at least.
- The parachute?

692
00:40:41,483 --> 00:40:43,678
Look, I've been free climbing
since I was 12, okay?

693
00:40:43,819 --> 00:40:45,047
It'll only slow me down.

694
00:40:45,721 --> 00:40:48,246
- My hero.
- Do you want to go out there?

695
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:49,584
Huh? Feel free.

696
00:40:49,725 --> 00:40:51,784
- Be my guest.

697
00:40:51,927 --> 00:40:53,485
- It might not even work.

698
00:40:53,628 --> 00:40:57,291
- What?
Look, will it or won't it?

699
00:40:57,999 --> 00:41:00,866
Sara, you're the expert here.
Will this work?

700
00:41:01,002 --> 00:41:02,731
Or won't it?

701
00:41:04,806 --> 00:41:08,298
- Enough pressure on the elevator
will be able to free it.

702
00:41:08,477 --> 00:41:09,967
So, yeah.
- Okay.

703
00:41:10,112 --> 00:41:11,670
- Alright, can you slow us down?

704
00:41:11,847 --> 00:41:12,779
- I'll try.
- Help me!

705
00:41:12,914 --> 00:41:14,381
- There's gotta be another option.

706
00:41:14,549 --> 00:41:16,813
- No, there isn't.
- There's no other way, you heard her.

707
00:41:16,985 --> 00:41:20,079
See that rope back there?
Get it and tie it to something.

708
00:41:20,222 --> 00:41:22,315
Make sure it's tight.
- Yeah, yeah, okay.

709
00:41:24,159 --> 00:41:25,717
Piece of cake.

710
00:41:25,894 --> 00:41:27,725
Who taught you how to tie a knot?

711
00:41:27,896 --> 00:41:29,557
- It's a knot.
- What?

712
00:41:29,731 --> 00:41:31,392
Like this.

713
00:41:31,566 --> 00:41:33,625
Sure you're ready for this?
- What's that supposed to mean?

714
00:41:33,802 --> 00:41:35,565
- It means you've been drinking, fuck-o.

715
00:41:35,704 --> 00:41:37,672
- Oh my God, come on.
- Not now!

716
00:41:37,806 --> 00:41:40,400
- I just need to know if I can trust you.

717
00:41:40,542 --> 00:41:43,238
Gimme this.
- Is this enough for you, huh?

718
00:41:43,378 --> 00:41:46,108
Are you satisfied now?
- Okay, okay.

719
00:41:46,248 --> 00:41:47,840
- Let's fucking do this...
- Let's do it.

720
00:41:48,016 --> 00:41:50,177
- Okay, I'm reducing power.

721
00:41:50,485 --> 00:41:51,850
- Okay.

722
00:41:51,987 --> 00:41:53,682
- Cory, come here.
- Yeah?

723
00:41:53,855 --> 00:41:56,221
Yeah, what?

724
00:41:56,391 --> 00:41:58,791
- Come back.
- Okay.

725
00:41:58,927 --> 00:42:00,554
- No, promise me, you'll come back.

726
00:42:00,695 --> 00:42:05,029
- I've done this a hundred times.
Okay, just not quite this high.

727
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,724
It's fine, fly okay?

728
00:42:09,805 --> 00:42:10,931
It's okay, okay?

729
00:42:11,106 --> 00:42:12,573
It's alright.

730
00:42:12,741 --> 00:42:14,174
Just keep me in focus, okay?

731
00:42:14,342 --> 00:42:16,435
Alright? Okay.

732
00:42:17,946 --> 00:42:19,345
Okay, let's do it!

733
00:42:19,514 --> 00:42:21,675
Come on.

734
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:43,760
Rock and roll.

735
00:42:52,414 --> 00:42:54,814
- What's wrong?
- Our weight distribution's off.

736
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:56,474
We're not balanced.

737
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:00,388
- Cory!
- Jesus Christ, Sara! Come on!

738
00:43:09,231 --> 00:43:11,995
- Sara!
- Come on. Okay.

739
00:43:20,242 --> 00:43:22,574
Ooooh. That's better.

740
00:43:22,711 --> 00:43:23,939
How's he doing?

741
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:25,239
- He's good, he's all right!

742
00:43:25,413 --> 00:43:27,142
He's alright, right buddy?

743
00:43:27,282 --> 00:43:28,647
- It's too far!

744
00:43:29,317 --> 00:43:31,615
I think I gotta jump.

745
00:43:31,753 --> 00:43:33,050
- What?

746
00:43:34,623 --> 00:43:35,851
Are you crazy?

747
00:43:38,493 --> 00:43:39,721
No!

748
00:43:48,336 --> 00:43:49,826
Jesus...

749
00:43:55,510 --> 00:43:57,501
There he is, he's here.
- Come on, Cory!

750
00:44:07,622 --> 00:44:09,249
- There we go. There we go.

751
00:44:10,592 --> 00:44:12,492
He's on the tail!
He's on the tail.

752
00:44:15,964 --> 00:44:17,090
Come on...

753
00:44:20,902 --> 00:44:22,369
Come on...

754
00:44:26,408 --> 00:44:27,739
- Come on, Cory. Come on.

755
00:44:37,285 --> 00:44:39,515
- I've got control back!
- He did it.

756
00:44:39,688 --> 00:44:41,280
You did it bro! Ha ha!!!

757
00:44:54,869 --> 00:44:56,496
Put that thing away
and come help me!

758
00:44:56,671 --> 00:44:57,603
Come on!
- Okay!

759
00:44:57,739 --> 00:44:58,967
- How's he doing back there?

760
00:44:59,107 --> 00:45:01,439
- He's not going to make it,
he's freezing!

761
00:45:01,576 --> 00:45:02,770
Gimme your hand!

762
00:45:02,911 --> 00:45:04,139
Gimme your hand!

763
00:45:04,279 --> 00:45:05,473
Come on, Cory!

764
00:45:08,149 --> 00:45:10,344
For Chrissake, Sara,
keep it steady!

765
00:45:10,485 --> 00:45:12,180
- I'm trying!

766
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:14,550
- Come on, Cory, I'm right here,
on the count of three,

767
00:45:14,723 --> 00:45:17,487
you're gonna take my hand, alright?

768
00:45:17,959 --> 00:45:19,586
Alright, ready? One...

769
00:45:21,262 --> 00:45:22,786
two....

770
00:45:24,666 --> 00:45:26,224
...three!

771
00:45:26,368 --> 00:45:28,563
No!!

772
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:30,637
Jesus! Fuck!

773
00:45:30,772 --> 00:45:31,830
Roll on!

774
00:45:33,308 --> 00:45:34,639
Ah, shit!

775
00:45:37,178 --> 00:45:38,475
Oh, my God!

776
00:45:54,529 --> 00:45:56,360
- Do you have him?

777
00:45:58,033 --> 00:46:00,399
Sal, what's happening?

778
00:46:00,568 --> 00:46:01,933
- Oh, shit!

779
00:46:16,918 --> 00:46:18,351
- Somebody talk to me.

780
00:46:29,564 --> 00:46:31,088
Sal.

781
00:46:32,167 --> 00:46:33,600
Sal.

782
00:46:37,739 --> 00:46:39,036
Sal.

783
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,804
- He's gone.

784
00:46:49,717 --> 00:46:51,207
- What?

785
00:46:52,253 --> 00:46:54,153
- He's gone.

786
00:46:55,890 --> 00:46:58,586
- No, no.

787
00:46:59,794 --> 00:47:02,490
- The fucking rope broke.
He's gone.

788
00:47:02,797 --> 00:47:04,992
No... oh, no.

789
00:47:08,570 --> 00:47:09,662
- I saw something.

790
00:47:11,005 --> 00:47:12,700
No, no, no.

791
00:47:12,874 --> 00:47:14,705
- I thought I saw it before,
now I know.

792
00:47:14,843 --> 00:47:16,140
- No, no.

793
00:47:16,311 --> 00:47:18,108
- Could you just shut up and listen?

794
00:47:18,279 --> 00:47:21,043
Shut up and listen to me.
It got him, I saw it.

795
00:47:21,783 --> 00:47:25,913
It was huge, it was fucking huge.

796
00:47:26,087 --> 00:47:27,645
It was black.

797
00:47:29,457 --> 00:47:31,516
You didn't see it.

798
00:47:31,693 --> 00:47:33,888
You didn't hear it.

799
00:47:34,028 --> 00:47:37,020
Look aren't you listening to me?
It fucking grabbed him, I saw it!

800
00:47:37,198 --> 00:47:40,065
- What does it matter?

801
00:47:40,201 --> 00:47:41,691
Cory's dead.

802
00:47:46,474 --> 00:47:48,374
- Yeah, well better him than us.

803
00:47:50,812 --> 00:47:52,677
Just get us down now, right now.

804
00:47:52,814 --> 00:47:53,838
- No.

805
00:47:53,982 --> 00:47:56,177
- Just land this plane now.

806
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:00,488
Get it down, Sara!
- I will, I will.

807
00:48:00,622 --> 00:48:01,748
- Right now....

808
00:48:01,890 --> 00:48:02,982
Right now.

809
00:49:02,417 --> 00:49:04,180
- Can anybody see anything?

810
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:07,845
- More goddamned cloud.

811
00:49:18,766 --> 00:49:19,926
- What happened?

812
00:49:21,302 --> 00:49:22,997
Where are we?

813
00:49:25,206 --> 00:49:26,730
Why the hell am I tied up?

814
00:49:27,342 --> 00:49:29,105
- It's for your own good.

815
00:49:36,784 --> 00:49:38,445
- We're not climbing anymore.

816
00:49:38,586 --> 00:49:40,554
- That's right.

817
00:49:41,456 --> 00:49:43,788
We're going to be okay now.

818
00:49:45,493 --> 00:49:46,585
- We are?

819
00:49:52,634 --> 00:49:53,794
- Where's Cory?

820
00:50:00,942 --> 00:50:02,307
Sara?

821
00:50:07,615 --> 00:50:08,946
- You killed him.

822
00:50:14,522 --> 00:50:16,456
He trusted you,

823
00:50:16,591 --> 00:50:19,287
and you... killed him.

824
00:50:21,329 --> 00:50:23,524
- What are you talking about, Mel?

825
00:50:24,232 --> 00:50:27,167
- This didn't break.
It was cut.

826
00:50:28,036 --> 00:50:30,766
- Are you listening to yourself
right now?

827
00:50:31,739 --> 00:50:32,831
Huh?

828
00:50:32,974 --> 00:50:35,306
You sound fucking crazy!

829
00:50:35,443 --> 00:50:36,967
- He saved our lives!

830
00:50:38,179 --> 00:50:40,909
- Where were you when I needed help
pulling him in, huh? Where were you?

831
00:50:41,049 --> 00:50:44,018
- I was there.
- Oh well, I must have blinked.

832
00:50:44,152 --> 00:50:45,380
- I hit my head.

833
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,613
- I'm sure you did.

834
00:50:47,789 --> 00:50:51,657
But you know what?
None of that matters now.

835
00:50:51,826 --> 00:50:54,226
Your boyfriend is gone.

836
00:50:54,662 --> 00:50:55,959
- What?

837
00:50:56,097 --> 00:50:57,997
- You heard me.

838
00:50:58,132 --> 00:50:59,656
- Mel, it was an accident.

839
00:50:59,834 --> 00:51:01,358
Okay? You know it was.

840
00:51:02,103 --> 00:51:03,536
- You're fucking crazy.

841
00:51:03,671 --> 00:51:05,832
- I'm the crazy one?
You just accused me of killing someone!

842
00:51:06,374 --> 00:51:07,671
- Guys! Stop!

843
00:51:07,809 --> 00:51:10,277
- Someone please tell me
what happened to Cory.

844
00:51:13,614 --> 00:51:16,048
- He went outside on the tail
to fix the elevator.

845
00:51:19,887 --> 00:51:21,650
Sal thinks something grabbed him.

846
00:51:21,789 --> 00:51:23,086
- Look, I know what I saw.

847
00:51:23,224 --> 00:51:25,454
Okay, I know what I saw!

848
00:51:25,593 --> 00:51:27,390
It was real.

849
00:51:29,530 --> 00:51:31,157
- What was? What was real?

850
00:51:31,299 --> 00:51:33,358
- We don't know.
- Bullshit.

851
00:51:33,868 --> 00:51:35,426
Bullshit! Bullshit!

852
00:51:35,570 --> 00:51:37,265
There's a monster out there!

853
00:51:37,438 --> 00:51:40,134
- Just shut up, okay?
Just shut up.

854
00:51:47,081 --> 00:51:49,379
- How long are you going
to keep me tied up for?

855
00:51:50,651 --> 00:51:52,448
- Until we know we can trust you.

856
00:51:53,988 --> 00:51:55,148
- Of course you can trust me.

857
00:51:55,289 --> 00:51:57,450
- Can I really?

858
00:51:57,592 --> 00:52:00,026
- You completely lost it earlier
and you lied to me.

859
00:52:00,161 --> 00:52:01,492
- About what?

860
00:52:06,634 --> 00:52:09,228
- Your parents weren't killed
in a car crash, were they?

861
00:52:13,274 --> 00:52:14,571
Were they?

862
00:52:15,643 --> 00:52:17,235
- No.

863
00:52:21,082 --> 00:52:23,243
- Mel, can you come up here, please?

864
00:52:30,124 --> 00:52:31,250
Keep an eye out.

865
00:52:33,261 --> 00:52:34,523
- For what?

866
00:52:36,431 --> 00:52:38,058
- Anything.

867
00:52:43,971 --> 00:52:46,906
You know how I said we were going
to have that talk later?

868
00:52:47,074 --> 00:52:48,200
Look at me!

869
00:52:48,342 --> 00:52:50,867
We're having it now.

870
00:52:51,646 --> 00:52:53,307
- I knew your mother.

871
00:52:57,351 --> 00:52:58,716
- What?

872
00:52:59,353 --> 00:53:01,150
- I knew your mother.

873
00:53:01,289 --> 00:53:03,484
- What are you talking about?

874
00:53:03,624 --> 00:53:05,489
- I was there when it happened.

875
00:53:07,862 --> 00:53:10,262
- When what happened?

876
00:53:11,332 --> 00:53:13,425
- I was one of the passengers.

877
00:53:29,283 --> 00:53:32,218
When they pulled me out of that lake,
half my bones were broken.

878
00:53:32,987 --> 00:53:36,286
I spent six months in the hospital
just trying to walk again.

879
00:53:37,992 --> 00:53:40,119
- So you're saying,
you're the Taylor's kid?

880
00:53:43,431 --> 00:53:45,194
- I thought you said your last name
was Parker?

881
00:53:46,534 --> 00:53:48,195
- The Parkers are my foster parents.

882
00:53:52,607 --> 00:53:55,804
- So, you knew who I was
when we first met?

883
00:53:56,511 --> 00:53:58,308
- I didn't want it to affect things
between us.

884
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:01,545
I, I knew you would freak out.
- Jesus, man.

885
00:54:02,683 --> 00:54:04,548
Freak her out?

886
00:54:07,922 --> 00:54:10,152
God, you guys are fucking
death magnets!

887
00:54:10,291 --> 00:54:11,952
Jesus, we're so fucked!

888
00:54:12,093 --> 00:54:13,321
We're so fucked!

889
00:54:15,096 --> 00:54:17,690
- What did you think would happen
when I went off to McGill?

890
00:54:19,433 --> 00:54:22,266
You think I'd fly home every
other weekend to see you?

891
00:54:22,403 --> 00:54:25,463
Our lives are going
in different directions.

892
00:54:27,508 --> 00:54:30,500
You're so different
than I thought you were.

893
00:54:30,678 --> 00:54:32,475
You're a liar.

894
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:35,344
You make up this story
like you know my mom.

895
00:54:35,516 --> 00:54:37,984
That's a sick, bullshit fantasy.

896
00:54:38,152 --> 00:54:40,814
You had to know that this,
this couldn't last.

897
00:54:41,589 --> 00:54:43,887
You had to know that,
tell me, you knew that.

898
00:54:44,091 --> 00:54:45,888
- Fantasy?

899
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:47,188
A fantasy?

900
00:54:47,328 --> 00:54:50,092
Your mom killed my parents!

901
00:54:51,566 --> 00:54:53,864
My life is so screwed up!

902
00:54:55,503 --> 00:54:57,437
Your mom destroyed my life!

903
00:55:00,374 --> 00:55:02,137
- You don't know shit.

904
00:55:02,310 --> 00:55:04,437
- I figured it out though.

905
00:55:05,246 --> 00:55:07,077
- Figured what out, Bruce?

906
00:55:07,748 --> 00:55:09,978
- We're meant to be together, Sara.
- Meant to be together?

907
00:55:10,117 --> 00:55:12,244
Are you crazy?
- I love you.

908
00:55:14,021 --> 00:55:15,511
What did you just say?

909
00:55:16,824 --> 00:55:18,189
- I love you.

910
00:55:19,427 --> 00:55:21,258
- Don't say that.

911
00:55:22,463 --> 00:55:26,229
Don't say that.

912
00:55:42,283 --> 00:55:45,775
Mayday, Mayday, Mayday,
Yankee Zulu X-ray.

913
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:49,219
Position and altitude unknown,
can anybody read me?

914
00:55:50,324 --> 00:55:52,383
- Can someone please
untie these ropes?

915
00:55:55,396 --> 00:55:57,660
- Sure, I'll get right to it.

916
00:55:58,399 --> 00:56:00,333
- Mayday, Mayday,
Yankee Zulu X-ray.

917
00:56:07,842 --> 00:56:08,900
- What is it?

918
00:56:12,246 --> 00:56:14,009
- I don't know.

919
00:56:14,548 --> 00:56:16,106
- Let us hear it.

920
00:56:29,930 --> 00:56:31,454
It's that thing.

921
00:56:33,267 --> 00:56:35,326
It's that thing, it's back.

922
00:56:35,469 --> 00:56:36,766
It's back.

923
00:56:36,937 --> 00:56:38,700
- No, it's distortion.
It has to be.

924
00:56:38,873 --> 00:56:41,171
- Oh, come on.
That's not distortion.

925
00:56:41,609 --> 00:56:43,543
- Well, whatever it is,
there's a rational explanation.

926
00:56:43,678 --> 00:56:46,078
- Well good, 'cause I think
we'd all like to hear it, Sara!

927
00:56:46,213 --> 00:56:47,703
- What do you want me to say?

928
00:56:47,848 --> 00:56:50,214
Okay, apoxia makes you see things,
or hear things.

929
00:56:50,384 --> 00:56:51,351
- But not the same things.

930
00:56:51,485 --> 00:56:53,612
Look, the altimeter says
we should be in outer space.

931
00:56:53,754 --> 00:56:56,086
How do you explain that right now?
- Some magnetic interference.

932
00:56:56,223 --> 00:56:58,919
- Sara, you heard it, it's not normal.

933
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:00,721
- Yeah, I heard something.

934
00:57:00,861 --> 00:57:03,989
It could be crosstalk or interference
with sunspots, something.

935
00:57:04,131 --> 00:57:06,964
- Oh my god, sunspots?
Are you kidding me?

936
00:57:07,134 --> 00:57:08,829
- You're not a radio expert, Sal!

937
00:57:08,969 --> 00:57:10,834
None of us are.

938
00:57:13,441 --> 00:57:14,738
- Alright, alright, let's just be real.

939
00:57:14,875 --> 00:57:18,675
I think there's something we all need
to admit right now, don't you think?

940
00:57:18,813 --> 00:57:20,075
- Admit what?

941
00:57:21,749 --> 00:57:22,875
- Come on, Sara.

942
00:57:23,017 --> 00:57:25,577
We've been going down
for what, like 20 minutes?

943
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:28,518
Tell me you're not thinking
the same thing I am!

944
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:34,623
- Spit it out.

945
00:57:38,032 --> 00:57:40,432
- Where the hell is the ground?

946
00:58:10,965 --> 00:58:12,023
- Sara.

947
00:58:13,467 --> 00:58:17,528
Sara, your dad,
he works on secret projects, right?

948
00:58:17,705 --> 00:58:19,366
- Yeah, Mel, what--
- Like for the Air Force?

949
00:58:19,540 --> 00:58:21,064
- Yeah...
- Yeah, good point.

950
00:58:21,208 --> 00:58:24,268
Yeah, remember the mechanic we saw,
the camel jockey?

951
00:58:24,445 --> 00:58:27,039
Well, maybe, just maybe,
he rigged the plane

952
00:58:27,214 --> 00:58:29,774
to kill the Colonel's daughter.
How's that?

953
00:58:29,917 --> 00:58:32,477
- Look, that's not what I meant.

954
00:58:32,653 --> 00:58:35,178
Okay, what if we don't need
to come down?

955
00:58:35,356 --> 00:58:37,483
What if we never took off?

956
00:58:37,658 --> 00:58:39,023
- Mel.

957
00:58:39,193 --> 00:58:42,185
- Just hear me out, what if we're just
part of some big experiment,

958
00:58:42,363 --> 00:58:44,729
you know, something to see
how people react to stress.

959
00:58:44,865 --> 00:58:47,629
- Mel, that's impossible.

960
00:58:47,768 --> 00:58:48,700
- Why?

961
00:58:48,869 --> 00:58:50,803
- Because he doesn't even know
we're here.

962
00:58:52,106 --> 00:58:53,232
- What?

963
00:58:54,141 --> 00:58:55,301
- What?

964
00:58:57,111 --> 00:58:59,045
- He thinks we were driving
to the concert.

965
00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:01,239
He doesn't even know
I have my pilot's license.

966
00:59:01,415 --> 00:59:02,780
- Are you shitting me, Sara?
- He's paranoid!

967
00:59:02,917 --> 00:59:05,181
He's convinced I'll end up
the same way my mom did!

968
00:59:05,352 --> 00:59:07,650
- Well, Jesus!
I wonder what gave him that idea!

969
00:59:07,788 --> 00:59:09,983
- It has nothing to do with that okay?

970
00:59:10,124 --> 00:59:12,684
The point is, it's not some giant
government conspiracy.

971
00:59:13,527 --> 00:59:16,394
- Why not?
- This doesn't happen in real life.

972
00:59:16,530 --> 00:59:18,828
- There wasn't any information
released on the plane that hit us.

973
00:59:18,966 --> 00:59:19,990
- What plane?

974
00:59:20,134 --> 00:59:21,965
- The one that killed her mom
and my parents.

975
00:59:22,102 --> 00:59:24,434
There's no record of it,
it just appeared out of nowhere.

976
00:59:24,572 --> 00:59:25,903
- The ghost plane theory? Really?

977
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:28,838
- It's just that we're trapped
in a hanger,

978
00:59:28,976 --> 00:59:30,944
we're plugged into some sort
of simulation or...

979
00:59:31,111 --> 00:59:32,840
maybe it's drugs, you know,

980
00:59:32,980 --> 00:59:35,471
like those LSD tests they did
back in the '60s.

981
00:59:35,649 --> 00:59:37,549
- One of hell of a bad trip we're having.

982
00:59:37,685 --> 00:59:40,586
- It makes more sense
than anything else!

983
00:59:46,694 --> 00:59:48,855
- Well shit, I say we find out.

984
00:59:49,029 --> 00:59:52,089
- How?
- I don't know... jump!

985
00:59:52,266 --> 00:59:55,133
I mean, in dreams, I don't know,
you're falling and you wake up,

986
00:59:55,302 --> 00:59:58,135
Maybe it's the same
in this situation, huh?

987
00:59:58,305 --> 01:00:00,136
Maybe it's the same.

988
01:00:01,709 --> 01:00:03,267
- You know what?
I think you're onto something,

989
01:00:03,410 --> 01:00:05,401
why don't you go ahead
and give it a shot.

990
01:00:05,546 --> 01:00:08,447
- Well maybe it's just
the booze talking, I don't know.

991
01:00:08,616 --> 01:00:10,982
I don't know!

992
01:00:11,151 --> 01:00:13,142
But right now, right now,

993
01:00:13,287 --> 01:00:15,812
it's saying shut the fuck up
and drink me.

994
01:00:15,990 --> 01:00:18,083
So you know what?

995
01:00:18,259 --> 01:00:20,489
I'm gonna do just that.

996
01:00:20,661 --> 01:00:21,719
Cheers.

997
01:00:23,764 --> 01:00:24,958
- Ahh!!!

998
01:01:03,003 --> 01:01:05,062
- Wake up, Sara...

999
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:07,200
Sara...

1000
01:01:09,743 --> 01:01:10,835
Sara...

1001
01:01:11,612 --> 01:01:13,842
Wake up, Sara.

1002
01:01:17,484 --> 01:01:19,213
Sara, wake up!

1003
01:01:21,422 --> 01:01:22,889
Sara!

1004
01:01:25,059 --> 01:01:26,219
Sara!

1005
01:01:27,061 --> 01:01:28,528
- Sara!

1006
01:01:28,696 --> 01:01:30,755
Sara, wake up!!!

1007
01:01:30,931 --> 01:01:33,263
Sara!

1008
01:01:33,434 --> 01:01:34,662
Sara, wake up!!!

1009
01:01:34,835 --> 01:01:38,464
Something hit us
and we need you to fly the plane.

1010
01:01:38,639 --> 01:01:40,334
Sara!

1011
01:01:50,084 --> 01:01:51,415
Sara!

1012
01:01:51,785 --> 01:01:52,877
Sara!

1013
01:01:55,322 --> 01:01:57,552
Come on, quick!

1014
01:02:00,995 --> 01:02:02,394
- Jesus...

1015
01:02:14,942 --> 01:02:16,068
- Come on!

1016
01:02:22,282 --> 01:02:24,011
- Ah!

1017
01:02:34,728 --> 01:02:35,786
- Sara!

1018
01:02:53,347 --> 01:02:54,712
I can't take this.

1019
01:02:56,016 --> 01:02:57,506
I can't take this anymore.

1020
01:02:59,586 --> 01:03:02,054
- No, no, Mel, stay with me,
stay with me.

1021
01:03:02,189 --> 01:03:03,656
Mel.

1022
01:03:04,658 --> 01:03:06,853
It's going to be okay.
I promise.

1023
01:03:07,027 --> 01:03:08,153
Okay?

1024
01:03:11,899 --> 01:03:13,526
It's going to be okay.

1025
01:03:57,044 --> 01:03:58,875
- What's that?
- Oh no...

1026
01:04:02,583 --> 01:04:04,710
- What? It's got us!

1027
01:04:04,885 --> 01:04:06,079
- What is it?
- Sara!

1028
01:04:11,458 --> 01:04:14,325
- Am I the only one
that's gone completely insane!

1029
01:04:14,461 --> 01:04:16,691
Did anybody else just hallucinate
something attacking us?!

1030
01:04:16,830 --> 01:04:18,695
- Calm down, Sal.
- Calm down?!!!

1031
01:04:18,832 --> 01:04:20,265
That thing's going to rip us apart!

1032
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:22,197
- Well whatever it is, it's gone, okay?
Just relax.

1033
01:04:22,336 --> 01:04:24,634
- You would say that,
'cause you put us in this situation.

1034
01:04:24,805 --> 01:04:26,272
- This isn't about me, okay?

1035
01:04:26,406 --> 01:04:27,930
This isn't my fault.

1036
01:04:30,077 --> 01:04:31,942
Bruce, what are you doing?

1037
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:33,944
Bruce, stop it, I'm serious.

1038
01:04:34,081 --> 01:04:35,207
- Sal...

1039
01:04:36,617 --> 01:04:39,780
Sal, I think I took too many,

1040
01:04:39,953 --> 01:04:41,580
I think I took many...
- Mel... Mel!

1041
01:04:42,156 --> 01:04:44,784
Mel!
Mel, Jesus Christ, Mel!

1042
01:04:44,858 --> 01:04:46,951
Oh come on, no, no,
don't do this, come on.

1043
01:04:47,027 --> 01:04:49,393
Come on... baby, baby.

1044
01:04:49,530 --> 01:04:51,259
Something's wrong with Mel!

1045
01:04:51,398 --> 01:04:52,695
- What happened to her?
- Don't know.

1046
01:04:52,833 --> 01:04:55,199
I, uh, can't feel a pulse.

1047
01:04:55,335 --> 01:04:56,825
I think she OD'd!
- OD'd on what?

1048
01:04:56,970 --> 01:04:59,200
- On her fucking pills,
what do you think she OD'd on?

1049
01:04:59,339 --> 01:05:01,864
Mel... oh baby oh, no, no, no...

1050
01:05:02,009 --> 01:05:04,637
- We got to get her breathing!
- Mel, come on!

1051
01:05:06,046 --> 01:05:07,206
- Please, please help her!

1052
01:05:07,347 --> 01:05:09,144
Please!
- What the fuck are you doing?!

1053
01:05:09,283 --> 01:05:10,272
- Move, move!

1054
01:05:14,254 --> 01:05:15,915
- Don't you fucking hurt her!

1055
01:05:19,626 --> 01:05:20,650
- Please.

1056
01:05:23,463 --> 01:05:24,487
- Jesus Christ, Mel!

1057
01:05:25,732 --> 01:05:28,758
- Come on. Come on, baby!

1058
01:05:28,902 --> 01:05:30,733
Come on. Come on.

1059
01:05:30,871 --> 01:05:32,668
Don't you fucking hurt her!
Don't hurt her!

1060
01:05:38,378 --> 01:05:40,209
Don't you fucking hurt her!
Don't hurt her.

1061
01:05:46,887 --> 01:05:48,752
- Yeah, yeah, it's okay.
I'm here, I'm here.

1062
01:05:48,889 --> 01:05:52,484
Come on, I'm here.

1063
01:05:55,028 --> 01:05:56,256
- Oh, thank God.

1064
01:05:56,396 --> 01:05:59,229
- Here we go, here we go.

1065
01:05:59,399 --> 01:06:01,731
You're okay, come here.

1066
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:07,299
You're okay, come here.

1067
01:06:11,511 --> 01:06:13,274
There you go, baby.

1068
01:06:19,653 --> 01:06:21,314
You're okay.

1069
01:06:21,488 --> 01:06:23,718
Look, baby, I never...

1070
01:06:23,857 --> 01:06:26,121
I never meant to say those things.

1071
01:06:26,293 --> 01:06:28,420
I didn't mean it, I didn't mean it,
I swear.

1072
01:06:28,695 --> 01:06:30,663
I didn't mean those things
I said to you.

1073
01:06:30,831 --> 01:06:31,991
- Sal...

1074
01:06:32,165 --> 01:06:34,099
- What, what, baby, what?

1075
01:06:34,268 --> 01:06:35,963
It's okay, what?
- About Cory...

1076
01:06:36,103 --> 01:06:38,071
- No, we don't need
to talk about that now.

1077
01:06:38,238 --> 01:06:40,297
We don't need
to talk about that now, baby.

1078
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:43,671
- Yes, we do.
- No, we don't, no we don't.

1079
01:06:44,578 --> 01:06:46,102
- I'm so sorry.

1080
01:06:46,246 --> 01:06:49,977
- It's okay, it's okay, baby.

1081
01:06:52,052 --> 01:06:53,349
- I'm so sorry.

1082
01:06:55,055 --> 01:06:57,046
I never meant to hurt you...

1083
01:06:58,458 --> 01:07:00,221
- Mel!!!!!

1084
01:07:11,538 --> 01:07:13,028
- What the hell was that?

1085
01:07:17,911 --> 01:07:21,108
- It got her, it fucking got her,
and it's gonna get us too...

1086
01:07:21,248 --> 01:07:22,875
It's gonna fucking get us too!

1087
01:07:32,926 --> 01:07:35,258
- There's no way... it can't be...

1088
01:07:36,330 --> 01:07:38,628
There's no way.
- What did you do?

1089
01:07:38,799 --> 01:07:40,664
What did you do, you fuck?!!!

1090
01:07:41,435 --> 01:07:44,097
What the fuck did you do,
you fucker?!

1091
01:07:44,237 --> 01:07:46,467
- Sal, Sal...
- I'm gonna fucking kill you!

1092
01:07:46,606 --> 01:07:48,506
- No, no, please no!
- I'm gonna fucking kill you!

1093
01:07:48,642 --> 01:07:51,372
- No! Sal!
- I'm gonna fucking kill you!

1094
01:07:54,881 --> 01:07:56,678
- No!

1095
01:07:57,317 --> 01:07:59,012
Sal! Let him go!

1096
01:08:02,089 --> 01:08:04,080
Sal!
- I'm gonna fucking kill you!

1097
01:08:04,224 --> 01:08:05,714
- Stop it, Sal!

1098
01:08:07,527 --> 01:08:08,994
- You fuck!

1099
01:08:13,834 --> 01:08:15,165
- Sara, help me up!

1100
01:08:15,302 --> 01:08:17,668
Don't let go of me!
- Come here.

1101
01:08:32,085 --> 01:08:33,074
Don't let go of me!

1102
01:08:33,220 --> 01:08:35,882
Please, don't let go of me!
- I got you.

1103
01:08:36,022 --> 01:08:37,387
- Nooo!

1104
01:09:47,627 --> 01:09:49,686
- They're dead.

1105
01:09:52,132 --> 01:09:53,622
They're all dead.

1106
01:09:56,636 --> 01:09:58,399
God, what have I done?

1107
01:09:59,973 --> 01:10:02,669
What have I done?

1108
01:10:05,579 --> 01:10:07,410
- It's not your fault.

1109
01:10:08,114 --> 01:10:09,445
- Yes, it is.

1110
01:10:10,650 --> 01:10:12,174
I'm the pilot.

1111
01:10:14,154 --> 01:10:15,985
I'm responsible.

1112
01:10:21,428 --> 01:10:22,793
He knew it.

1113
01:10:24,664 --> 01:10:25,790
He knew it.

1114
01:10:29,970 --> 01:10:31,437
My dad knew it.

1115
01:10:34,741 --> 01:10:37,403
He knew it from the day we buried her.

1116
01:10:44,284 --> 01:10:46,548
I wasn't allowed to see her body.

1117
01:10:51,324 --> 01:10:54,555
All I remember is the flowers
on her casket.

1118
01:10:58,565 --> 01:10:59,793
Tulips.

1119
01:11:02,602 --> 01:11:04,695
Tulips were her favourite.

1120
01:11:08,508 --> 01:11:10,032
God, I miss her.

1121
01:11:12,512 --> 01:11:15,003
I miss her so much.

1122
01:11:22,656 --> 01:11:25,250
I never believed she was really gone.

1123
01:11:26,893 --> 01:11:31,330
I thought, thought maybe
she was lost somewhere up there,

1124
01:11:31,498 --> 01:11:35,798
and that, if I learned to fly I could,

1125
01:11:35,969 --> 01:11:38,335
I could find her and bring her home.

1126
01:11:43,843 --> 01:11:46,243
I want her to come home.

1127
01:11:49,950 --> 01:11:52,180
- This happened before
and it's happening again.

1128
01:11:52,986 --> 01:11:54,112
- No.

1129
01:11:54,287 --> 01:11:55,777
Bruce, no.

1130
01:11:55,956 --> 01:11:59,915
This isn't about your parents,
or my mom,

1131
01:12:00,093 --> 01:12:02,960
or any conspiracy, okay?
It's not about that.

1132
01:12:04,531 --> 01:12:06,522
- You're right, Sara.
I know that now.

1133
01:12:08,401 --> 01:12:09,595
- Then what?

1134
01:12:10,804 --> 01:12:12,294
- It's me.

1135
01:12:18,378 --> 01:12:20,471
- What are you talking about?

1136
01:12:23,316 --> 01:12:25,716
- Ten years ago on that plane,
I saw...

1137
01:12:25,852 --> 01:12:27,945
I saw something... I...

1138
01:12:30,323 --> 01:12:32,518
There was a storm...

1139
01:12:33,226 --> 01:12:35,023
Turbulence...

1140
01:12:37,964 --> 01:12:39,898
The cover of a magazine.

1141
01:12:40,100 --> 01:12:41,624
I was scared.

1142
01:12:41,935 --> 01:12:43,766
I imagined it happening to us.

1143
01:12:47,173 --> 01:12:48,606
It did.

1144
01:12:50,810 --> 01:12:53,779
- No, that's insane.
That's just a coincidence.

1145
01:12:57,917 --> 01:12:59,384
- Then what do you call this, huh?

1146
01:13:04,357 --> 01:13:05,449
- What?

1147
01:13:05,992 --> 01:13:07,118
The comic?

1148
01:13:08,695 --> 01:13:10,492
- Just look.

1149
01:13:11,598 --> 01:13:12,530
- What?

1150
01:13:13,867 --> 01:13:16,427
- We should probably turn around.
- I'm trying.

1151
01:13:16,603 --> 01:13:19,163
- 20,000 feet?
- Where the hell is the ground?

1152
01:13:22,108 --> 01:13:26,306
- You killed him.
- This didn't break, it was cut.

1153
01:13:35,055 --> 01:13:36,716
- What are you saying?

1154
01:13:36,890 --> 01:13:39,222
This is... this is some kind of curse?

1155
01:13:39,392 --> 01:13:40,552
- Aren't you listening?

1156
01:13:40,727 --> 01:13:43,491
I made these things come true
just by thinking about them.

1157
01:13:43,763 --> 01:13:45,424
I should have never gotten
on this plane.

1158
01:13:45,565 --> 01:13:47,658
- Why, because you're scared to fly?
- Don't you get it?

1159
01:13:47,801 --> 01:13:49,564
That's when it happens,
when I'm really scared.

1160
01:13:49,703 --> 01:13:53,230
- So you're telling me that this is
some kind of fantasy world come to life?

1161
01:13:53,373 --> 01:13:56,103
- Sara, look around,
this isn't a fantasy,

1162
01:13:56,276 --> 01:13:58,107
it's a nightmare.

1163
01:14:02,215 --> 01:14:03,910
- I'm not gonna let us die!

1164
01:14:06,386 --> 01:14:08,251
- You're never gonna outfly it!

1165
01:14:08,421 --> 01:14:10,480
- We'll see. Hang on!

1166
01:14:30,844 --> 01:14:31,868
- Oh shit.

1167
01:14:32,011 --> 01:14:33,273
Shit... shit!

1168
01:14:48,027 --> 01:14:50,689
Another hit like that and we're dead.

1169
01:14:50,864 --> 01:14:54,664
- I told you, I told you, I told you...

1170
01:14:56,369 --> 01:14:58,166
- Are you really causing this?

1171
01:14:58,338 --> 01:15:00,533
Is this really because of you?

1172
01:15:03,209 --> 01:15:06,235
Then prove it.
Make that thing go away!

1173
01:15:06,379 --> 01:15:07,971
- I don't know how.

1174
01:15:08,114 --> 01:15:11,015
- Make it go away!
- I don't know how!

1175
01:15:12,752 --> 01:15:13,912
- Bruce...

1176
01:15:14,053 --> 01:15:17,420
Man is what he wills himself to be.

1177
01:15:17,557 --> 01:15:18,854
Sartre, right?

1178
01:15:19,292 --> 01:15:23,524
Stop being such a pussy
and face your fears.

1179
01:15:23,663 --> 01:15:25,130
Face your fears!

1180
01:15:49,589 --> 01:15:51,716
Bruce!

1181
01:15:51,858 --> 01:15:53,291
Bruce!!

1182
01:16:16,482 --> 01:16:18,245
Jesus...

1183
01:16:18,384 --> 01:16:20,409
it is you.

1184
01:16:35,401 --> 01:16:37,835
Mayday, Mayday, Mayday,
Yankee Zulu X-ray,

1185
01:16:38,004 --> 01:16:39,198
can anyone read me?

1186
01:16:43,142 --> 01:16:45,133
Mayday, Mayday, Mayday,
Yankee Zulu X-ray.

1187
01:16:47,413 --> 01:16:48,607
-... This is Lakeview Centre,

1188
01:16:48,748 --> 01:16:50,909
received your Mayday.
What is your emergency?

1189
01:16:51,050 --> 01:16:52,779
- I just got through to ground.

1190
01:16:53,686 --> 01:16:55,711
We're gonna make it.

1191
01:17:03,696 --> 01:17:05,926
- You didn't mean it, did you?

1192
01:17:08,468 --> 01:17:10,800
- Mean what?

1193
01:17:11,838 --> 01:17:13,499
- That kiss.

1194
01:17:17,343 --> 01:17:19,277
- I care about you, Bruce.

1195
01:17:20,146 --> 01:17:22,239
You know that.

1196
01:17:27,954 --> 01:17:28,921
Bruce.

1197
01:17:29,088 --> 01:17:30,385
Bruce!
- I can't help it.

1198
01:17:30,556 --> 01:17:32,751
- Yes, you can!

1199
01:17:34,327 --> 01:17:35,658
Oh, no!

1200
01:17:36,129 --> 01:17:38,222
Bruce! No!

1201
01:17:57,450 --> 01:17:59,782
Get us out of here!
- It's not that simple!

1202
01:17:59,953 --> 01:18:02,251
- Why not?
Just think us somewhere else!

1203
01:18:02,388 --> 01:18:05,414
- You don't understand, I've never made
anything good happen in my life.

1204
01:18:05,558 --> 01:18:07,651
What if I can't?

1205
01:18:09,095 --> 01:18:10,153
Sara!

1206
01:18:10,330 --> 01:18:11,319
Nooooo!!!

1207
01:18:11,497 --> 01:18:12,794
- Bruce!

1208
01:18:18,104 --> 01:18:19,196
- Sara!

1209
01:18:25,812 --> 01:18:26,972
- Bruce!!!

1210
01:18:28,614 --> 01:18:31,549
- Sara!!!!
- Your parents, Bruce!

1211
01:18:33,019 --> 01:18:35,385
Think of your parents!

1212
01:18:35,521 --> 01:18:37,284
- My parents?

1213
01:18:37,423 --> 01:18:40,392
- They wouldn't want you to die
like this, they'd want you to survive.

1214
01:18:42,495 --> 01:18:44,292
Don't you understand?

1215
01:18:44,464 --> 01:18:48,332
You can be with them again,
all you have to do is imagine it!

1216
01:18:50,236 --> 01:18:52,295
- Sara!
- Imagine it!

1217
01:18:56,175 --> 01:18:58,905
- Nooo!!!!

1218
01:19:25,104 --> 01:19:26,799
- What happened?

1219
01:19:30,543 --> 01:19:33,034
- I did it.
I thought us somewhere else.

1220
01:19:35,615 --> 01:19:37,139
- Oh no!

1221
01:20:13,553 --> 01:20:15,145
- Where the hell did he come from?

1222
01:20:21,194 --> 01:20:22,286
- Was that...?

1223
01:20:22,428 --> 01:20:24,123
- I think so.

1224
01:20:24,297 --> 01:20:26,322
- Did we just...?
- Yeah.

1225
01:20:40,847 --> 01:20:43,315
- If you're gonna do your thing...

1226
01:20:43,449 --> 01:20:45,314
now's the time.

1227
01:20:51,257 --> 01:20:53,748
- It's already done.

1228
01:21:29,395 --> 01:21:32,421
- Mom! Mom!

1229
01:21:32,999 --> 01:21:36,025
- I'm okay, sweetie.

1230
01:21:40,940 --> 01:21:43,306
Everybody gets one near miss, right?

1231
01:21:45,778 --> 01:21:47,302
- Do you think they made it?

1232
01:21:50,049 --> 01:21:51,949
- I hope so.

1233
01:22:00,793 --> 01:22:02,852
- Hi, I'm Sara.

1234
01:22:03,563 --> 01:22:04,860
- Bruce.
