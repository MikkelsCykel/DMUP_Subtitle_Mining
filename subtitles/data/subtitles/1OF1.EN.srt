00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,580
Do you know what true love means?

2
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,260
Do you know what that'll mean...

3
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:26,780
...standing up by the person
who takes your hand?

4
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:30,820
- I'm close.
- Oh, Richie!

5
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:33,220
You just want one thing.

6
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,420
When you're done, it'll be all over for us.

7
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:38,860
- I brought some of these.
- No!

8
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:40,740
- Not yet.
- What do you mean, '"not yet'"?

9
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,980
Half hour? Five years?
You always say, '"not yet.'"

10
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,180
Not yet!

11
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,740
A guy could die from this.

12
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:51,900
You want to be responsible for that?

13
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,060
- I'll do it with my hands.
- No.

14
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,180
I could do it with my hand.

15
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,540
Richie, I got my reputation to worry about.

16
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:04,820
You're a guy. Guys don't have to
worry about their reputations.

17
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:07,940
- But Despie, I love you.
- Oh, you love me?

18
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:10,500
Richie, I love you.

19
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:12,860
I love you.

20
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:17,780
Oh, Richie!

21
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:23,180
LES SEIGNEURS

22
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,380
Turkey?

23
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,620
Turkey, is that you?

24
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,980
- What happened, man?
- What are you talking about?

25
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,860
What did you do to yourself now?

26
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:19,060
- What's wrong with you?
- What are you talking about?

27
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:23,620
I shaved my head.
I got to go talk to those guys over there.

28
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:25,820
Listen to me!

29
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,380
I got you in the Wanderers.
I thought you was my friend.

30
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,180
I am your friend.

31
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,540
You don't need those guys.
You're a Wanderer.

32
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:36,100
You can't be a Wanderer for graduation.
I'm thinking about the future, Joey!

33
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:39,260
I'll be a Fordham Baldie.
Wait and see. The Baldies got it made.

34
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:43,740
Those guys look like a bunch
of Neanderthal retards. Look at them.

35
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:46,940
Are you kidding?
Those are the Fordham Baldies, Joey!

36
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:51,100
They shave their heads so their hair
won't get in their eyes when they fight.

37
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,660
Nobody fucks with the Baldies, man.

38
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,900
Those guys look like
a bunch of pricks with ears.

39
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,540
What did you just say?

40
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:02,540
- I ain't talking to you. Scram!
- Easy, Joey.

41
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,060
Hey, Peewee.

42
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:07,300
Joey, this is Peewee.
She's head of the Baldies' Ladies Auxiliary.

43
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,620
That's Terror's woman.
She goes with Terror.

44
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,020
How you doing, Peewee?

45
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,420
- What did you just say?
- Nothing, Peewee.

46
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:16,420
I ain't talking to you!
What did you just say about pricks?

47
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,260
I said, '"pricks with ears.'"

48
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,100
Terror, this asshole said we look like
a bunch of pricks with ears.

49
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,940
He didn't say that, did you, Joey?

50
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,620
- Oh, yeah, then what did he say?
- I didn't say that.

51
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:30,020
I didn't say you guys looked
like a bunch of pricks with ears.

52
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:32,820
I said you looked like
a bunch of ears without pricks!

53
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,220
Terror, how you doing?

54
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,780
- Can I talk to you?
- Get him!

55
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,860
When I get a hold of your ass...

56
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,980
Let me alone. I like you guys.

57
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,620
Come on, Turkey, come on!

58
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,380
Let's get these motherfuckers!

59
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,300
Come on, Terror!

60
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,140
Wait till I catch you, you skinny prick!

61
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,940
Come on, Terror!

62
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,380
Look at them go!

63
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,140
Hey, you! Come back, you creep!

64
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,860
- Oh, shit!
- What's wrong?

65
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,380
I gotta go.

66
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,140
- What?
- I gotta go.

67
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,340
It sounds like a Wanderer's in trouble.

68
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,860
A what?

69
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:11,060
You should be careful, now.

70
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,620
Hey, Buddy! Somebody's in trouble!

71
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,820
Looks like we're gonna
have to stomp some ass.

72
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,380
- What?
- It's Joey and Turkey.

73
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:30,460
Joey, don't worry.
We'll pummel whoever's following you!

74
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,100
The Baldies!

75
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,340
Baldies? Shit! Let's get out of here!

76
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,500
Shit.

77
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,500
Joey, what did we do?

78
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,580
Nothing! They just started chasing me.

79
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,260
Cut it out, asshole!

80
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:16,740
Easy, easy, free Turkey, man.

81
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:20,460
This little guy don't mean no harm, man.
He's just a fucking idiot.

82
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,060
Leave the kid alone.

83
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,540
You say something, mother...

84
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:37,620
Hey! You hear me? I'm talking to you.

85
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,740
Leave the kid alone.

86
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,780
You know who you're talking to, asshole?

87
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,100
Beat it. Nobody fucks with the Baldies.

88
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,820
Asshole!

89
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,020
Leave the kid alone.

90
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:03,900
Got you.

91
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,140
Your ass is grass, motherfucker.

92
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:17,340
- Beat it, you scumbag!
- Joey, what's wrong with you?

93
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:23,740
Terror.

94
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:53,140
You'd better watch your mouth, kid.

95
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,500
Stay back.

96
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,620
They shaved your head, Turkey?

97
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:03,620
- Yeah, they shaved his head.
- Oh, Jesus.

98
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:07,380
I didn't think I'd see the day when Terror
backed down to anybody like that.

99
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,260
Did you see how chickenshit he was?

100
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,420
He wasn't chickenshit, Joey.

101
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:15,020
Terror ain't chickenshit of nobody.
He's just waiting for the right time.

102
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,700
Are you kidding?
Did you see what this guy did here?

103
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,300
- Where'd he go?
- Hey, come back here, man!

104
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,820
Where'd that guy go?

105
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:47,620
Strong.

106
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:48,860
I'm strong.

107
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,700
Leave the kid...

108
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:53,940
...alone.

109
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:55,740
Jujitsu.

110
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,740
It's you.

111
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:09,140
I've been looking all over for you.
Where did you go?

112
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:13,300
I want to thank you.
What you did back there was great.

113
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,100
Forget about it.

114
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,940
You shouldn't have wised off
to those guys.

115
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:27,580
But I don't like to see big guys
pick on little guys. Know what I mean?

116
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,260
I can take care of myself, all right?

117
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:33,940
Sure you can.

118
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:38,140
What are you doing here
waiting for my elevator?

119
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:41,420
- I'm waiting to go home.
- You live here?

120
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,300
This building?

121
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,300
Hey, what floor?

122
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,580
- Four.
- I live on four.

123
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:52,540
You're the new people, right?
My mom told me that.

124
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:56,380
How do you like that? We're neighbors.

125
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:57,940
I'm Joey.

126
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:00,220
- Perry.
- Perry.

127
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,620
Hey, where is it!

128
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:06,940
Where is it, you bastards on the fifth floor!
I know what you're doing up there.

129
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,060
Assholes!

130
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,300
Excuse me, ma'am.

131
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,940
I heard about your old man, how he died.

132
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,180
The Wanderers are the guys
to get in with around here.

133
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:28,420
We've got a great football team,
great athletes, lots of girls.

134
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:31,580
Maybe you can join up,
I'll show you around, okay?

135
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:35,900
Okay, thanks.

136
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:40,860
You got to get into a gang.
You just ain't safe unless...

137
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,780
This is my father, Emilio, and this is...

138
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:48,220
I told you not to be talking in the hallway!

139
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,620
Perry? Darling, is that you?

140
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,300
Yeah, it's me, Ma.

141
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:02,860
Would you mind running down
to the store and getting me something?

142
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:05,860
Don't worry, sweetie.
They won't ask you for I.D.

143
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,220
Okay?

144
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:14,700
Under sunny skies, WNCA, New York City.
Good morning.

145
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:18,100
You've got to lock your doors around here.

146
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,260
Great car, great car. Come on, we're late.

147
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:25,980
You get to drive your mother's car
to school every day?

148
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:30,180
She don't drive it so much.
She's got high blood pressure.

149
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:31,660
Too bad.

150
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,340
Are you 18?

151
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,940
Yeah, I'm 19.

152
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:39,900
- I got held back, you know?
- Yeah, sure.

153
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:41,860
Joey!

154
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:44,500
Hey, how's it hanging, guys?

155
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,580
You were really cool yesterday, man.
John Wayne.

156
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,380
Joey, what's his name?

157
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:53,420
What's your name? Don't sweat it, Joey.
I just want to meet the guy, man.

158
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,060
Joey.

159
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,820
Would you get off my ass!

160
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,700
We got all kinds of gangs here.

161
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,180
See these guys here?

162
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,380
Those are the Executioners.
Over here on the left...

163
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:10,820
...the Ghettos, they're Jewish.
On the right, in green, the Irish...

164
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:13,180
...the Delaney's. You're Italian, right?
- Yeah.

165
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:17,100
Then you got to get into an Italian gang,
like the Wanderers.

166
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,340
Hey, Turkey,
where's the dollar you owe me?

167
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:22,300
- How you doing? Good to see you.
- Here's your dollar.

168
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,700
Then you got your nigger gangs.
You got your Cavaliers...

169
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:28,700
...you got your Pips here,
and then you got your Mau Mau's.

170
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:32,220
D.B. Stands for '"Del Bombers,'"
the toughest nigger gang around.

171
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:35,900
Hey, coon Stitch. Hey, how you doing?

172
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,460
Good to see you.

173
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:40,980
What's this?

174
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,500
Hey, Teddy Wong!

175
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:46,460
Twenty-seven guys with the last
name Wong, who all know jujitsu.

176
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:48,500
Could kill you with one judo chop.

177
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,740
Do you got gangs like this
where you come from?

178
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:53,220
We don't got this stuff
in Trenton, New Jersey.

179
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:55,620
Don't worry about anything.

180
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:58,380
Hang out with the Wanderers,
and we'll take care of you.

181
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,300
Richie, where are you?

182
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,100
Richie, we got him.

183
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:11,860
Richie Gennaro.

184
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,660
- Perry Maguire.
- How you doing?

185
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,780
I want to thank you for helping us out.

186
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:21,820
Anytime you need anything,
you let me know. All right?

187
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,580
Richie, I got your homework.

188
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,180
Wow, that's a nice job.

189
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:38,060
You even goofed up my handwriting.
Thanks, you're my main man.

190
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,380
Hey, Richie?

191
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:44,620
Turkey, take your hat off and get your feet
off the desk. It smells bad enough.

192
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,180
Very funny, Mr. Sharp.

193
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,340
I said, '"take your hat off! '"

194
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,060
Come on, take it off.

195
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:59,500
What's the matter?
You guys never seen a Baldie before?

196
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,940
Mr. Sharp, did you see
what Turkey just did?

197
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,260
Shut up, stupid!

198
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,820
Are you gonna make me, motherfucker?
Let's go.

199
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,140
All right, settle down.

200
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,780
You've both got detention.

201
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,380
Mr. Sharp, man. Damn.

202
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:28,900
Mr. Sharp...

203
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,380
Them white boys here,
they's getting obstreperous.

204
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,180
Anybody know what week this is?

205
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,340
- Brotherhood Week.
- Very good, Stitch.

206
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,740
Now, who wrote this?

207
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,300
You did.

208
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:56,860
'"A. Lincoln.'"

209
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,580
'"Race, creed, color.'"

210
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:12,700
I wanna see how many different races
we have just here in this classroom.

211
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,420
All Jewish people, stand up.

212
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,140
Okay. All the Italians.

213
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,340
All right! Okay. Settle down.

214
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:49,340
All Colored.

215
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:05,180
What's the matter, Stitch?
Don't we have a group to suit you?

216
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,460
No, I'm an Eskimo.

217
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,020
Where can I get some Eskimo pie?

218
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,780
Okay.

219
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:24,220
Colored. Italian.

220
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:27,460
Or is it Colored and Eye-talian?

221
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,380
Is that the way your old man talks?
The Colored.

222
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:35,500
How about you guys?
What do you say after school, Eye-talian?

223
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,220
Let's talk some straight talk.

224
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,900
Let's call a spade a spade.

225
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,180
Let's talk straight. Give me some names.

226
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,540
Come on.

227
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:53,780
Nigger.

228
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:02,940
Grease ball.

229
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:04,460
- Yeah.
- That's right.

230
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:05,580
Jungle bunny.

231
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,180
Swamp Guinea.

232
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,180
Handkerchief head.

233
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,100
Mountain wop.

234
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:18,740
Bogey.

235
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:19,620
Guinea.

236
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:20,660
Coon!

237
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:21,780
Dago.

238
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,700
Watch you mouth, boo-boo.

239
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:24,700
Spear-chucker!

240
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:27,340
Motherfucker, I'm gonna chuck a spear
up your ass!

241
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:29,540
Hold it! I can't write that fast.

242
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:34,020
Is that it? That's all?

243
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,660
We ran out of names pretty fast.

244
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,420
What did we learn here today?

245
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:42,500
Mr. Sharp, the white boys forgot
a couple of names.

246
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:46,620
They forgot spade...

247
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,420
...spooks and jigs.

248
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:55,020
Put that on the board.

249
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,940
How did you guys forget those names?

250
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,460
There must have been
a mental lapse, Mr. Sharp.

251
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,740
Mr. Sharp, I think it's because...

252
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:05,580
...they are a bunch of dumb-ass,
grease ball, Guinea, wop...

253
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,020
You black bastard.

254
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,900
Fuck you, dago motherfucker!

255
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:11,900
- Jigaboo!
- Your mama.

256
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:14,300
- You ain't got one.
- What'd you say?

257
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,500
Fuck you!

258
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:20,020
Hold it!

259
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:34,540
Hold it.

260
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:39,420
We'll meet you at Prince Charles' Field,
okay? Saturday.

261
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,180
You got it. Saturday at noon.

262
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:43,260
No guns and no knives.

263
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,780
I want everybody after school, everybody.

264
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,500
Fuckin' hang that little bastard.

265
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:56,860
That's the only way you're going to learn
about brotherhood!

266
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,060
What's the matter with you guys?

267
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,820
Haven't you heard '"sticks and stones
will break my bones...

268
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,140
'"...but names will never hurt me'"?

269
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,300
Come on, motherfucker!

270
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,500
All you motherfuckers!

271
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:11,740
Get down there!

272
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,380
What's the matter with you animals?

273
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,180
Any homework?

274
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,660
We don't want to get into this.

275
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:55,780
I know the neighborhood's changed,
but are you guys chickenshit?

276
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:58,860
- You guys started it.
- We didn't start it.

277
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:01,060
- We heard you did.
- You heard wrong.

278
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,660
- What else?
- We ain't Italian.

279
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,700
I know you ain't Italian.

280
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:07,780
Come on, what do you say?

281
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:15,540
We say good luck to you.

282
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,860
Yeah, good luck, faggots.

283
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:19,820
Motherfucking faggots.

284
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,020
Come back here.

285
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,860
We're with you. No nigger will face this.

286
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:31,580
What are you doing?
We don't need those. Put it away.

287
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,980
You kidding me?
Those guys will show up with pieces.

288
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,460
Don't trust them.
You got to go for them first.

289
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:39,180
- He got a point, Richie.
- Me and Clinton agreed.

290
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:42,660
- No guns or knives.
- You gonna trust that nigger?

291
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:46,860
You don't know where you're living.
We ain't going with you without these.

292
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,700
Then you ain't going with us.

293
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,900
Nice knowing you guys.

294
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:53,620
Have fun.

295
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,780
Fucking pussies.

296
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,460
I don't know, man.

297
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:59,020
Come on.

298
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:04,140
Look, Richie, call my friends, the Baldies.

299
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:08,020
Those guys like me.

300
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:11,660
Call them, I think they'll come in with us.
With them in, it's all over.

301
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:14,340
Listen, I ain't calling those guys.
I got my pride.

302
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:16,580
Sometimes all you got is pride.

303
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,780
Got to hold your head up high.

304
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:22,620
I seen this movie once
where this guy was tortured by the Japs...

305
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,780
...but he wouldn't give them
any information.

306
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,860
Every time they tortured him...

307
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:30,540
...he started singing
the Star-Spangled Banner.

308
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:33,660
Wow. What happened?

309
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:38,620
- They killed him.
- Shut up, you're depressing me.

310
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:42,460
What was that?

311
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:45,380
You got the jitters.
I'm going to take a whiz.

312
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:48,100
I thought I heard something.
You guys hear anything?

313
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,220
Baldies got guys, too.

314
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,340
It's the Wongs!

315
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:24,540
Teddy Wong. How you doing?

316
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,860
- I thought you was coming earlier.
- We did, man.

317
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,900
We waited until now
to make ourselves known.

318
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:33,820
You've just been hanging out
in the bushes?

319
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,700
- Pretty spooky.
- We've been listening.

320
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:40,180
I called you Wongs here tonight
for a reason.

321
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:42,460
- We know your reason.
- Gonna join us?

322
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:43,980
No.

323
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:47,460
- You're gonna join them?
- Stay back!

324
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,620
Don't fuck with the Wongs.

325
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:55,060
The Wongs never joined with anybody...

326
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,180
...yet.

327
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:57,900
What do you mean by '"yet'"?

328
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,460
We'll decide what's right
when the time comes.

329
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:02,620
The Wongs will wait and see.

330
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:17,100
When what time comes?
What do they mean?

331
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,900
- Where did they go?
- I don't know.

332
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,220
Get back here!

333
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:22,940
No, get the fuck out of here,
you Chink assholes.

334
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:25,180
No sweat, they can't hear me.

335
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:27,300
Don't fuck with the Wongs!

336
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:30,940
Richie, listen to what I just heard.

337
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:35,100
It ain't just the Del Bombers, man.
They're bringing in the Pips, the Cavaliers...

338
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:38,780
...the Mau Mau's.
- Shit, we've got a fucking race war.

339
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:42,940
Maybe we'll bring in some guys
from Brooklyn, the Golden Guineas.

340
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:45,420
One thing: We got to stay cool.

341
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:49,820
Did you notice those spades got
two million cousins all over the country?

342
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:52,580
We need help,
and I'm calling my friends in, the Baldies.

343
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,100
Enough, man. Forget it.

344
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:57,740
Guess who.

345
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,340
Al Capone.

346
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,300
No.

347
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,580
- It's me.
- What do you know.

348
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:07,340
What are you doing, Richie?
What's that list?

349
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:11,060
- You're gonna rumble?
- No, it's just some business.

350
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:13,100
I'll talk to you later, all right?

351
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:15,260
I thought we were
gonna buy some records.

352
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:17,980
Maybe a little later, all right?

353
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:19,500
Love you, baby.

354
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:20,620
Love you, too.

355
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:25,580
Richie, my daddy wants to see you.

356
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,180
How you doing?

357
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:40,580
I heard Chubby was looking for me.

358
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,140
Over there.

359
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,380
Over here, Richie.

360
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,140
- You wanna see me, Mr. Galasso?
- Yeah.

361
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:56,620
Me and my brothers
wanted to see you because...

362
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:59,620
...we heard you got some trouble
with the Colored.

363
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,860
How did you hear about that?

364
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:05,500
How did we hear about that?

365
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:09,780
How do the Galasso brothers hear
about anything in this neighborhood?

366
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,980
The reason I'm asking is that...

367
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,940
...maybe you could use some help.

368
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:17,540
No, we can handle it.

369
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:22,180
Remember, Richie, in this day and age,
in this neighborhood...

370
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:26,780
...there's lot of ways to skin the cat.
Do you know what I mean?

371
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:29,260
- Not exactly.
- Think about it.

372
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:31,780
You know where to find us.

373
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:34,900
You guys wanted Joey to come
so he could heal old wounds.

374
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:37,660
I respect these guys.
Give them a good rumble, they're happy.

375
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:40,300
Look what's coming.
Look what the cat dragged in.

376
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:44,020
Hey, my favorite Wanderer.

377
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:49,500
You know, Joey,
if I had a dog with a face like yours...

378
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:52,780
...l'd shave its ass
and teach it to walk backwards.

379
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,740
Very funny, Terror. Very funny.

380
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:00,380
We've come to you because
we've got problems with the niggers.

381
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:02,300
You guys know Roger, don't you?

382
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:05,300
What do you mothers want?

383
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:07,500
We've got some personal business here.

384
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:09,740
You guys go to Tulley High, don't you?

385
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:15,860
Maybe you know a cousin of mine.
Clinton Stitch? He's in the Del Bombers.

386
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:19,580
Stitch is a good friend of mine.
You know Clinton, don't you?

387
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:20,900
Everybody knows Clinton.

388
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:23,820
I think we can talk business better
in the park.

389
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,780
- Is this a joke?
- Sure, it's a joke.

390
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:28,380
Just like your little joke
about pricks with ears.

391
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:31,460
- Or was it ears without pricks?
- Where are we going?

392
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:38,700
Hey, Terror, I knew you wasn't chickenshit.

393
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:40,580
Turkey, do me a favor, will you?

394
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:43,260
Sure, Terror,
you know how I feel about you guys.

395
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:44,500
Hold these.

396
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:52,380
We're thinking about making you guys
honorary members of the Baldies.

397
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,820
That's great, Peewee.

398
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:56,860
We thought we might start
by shaving your heads.

399
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:59,660
Come on, not my hair, all right?

400
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:04,900
Too good for us?
Maybe we won't take your hair off.

401
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:07,460
We'll just take something else off.

402
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,340
- Drop your pants.
- Sure, whatever you want.

403
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:13,500
Not you, Turkey. You're gonna help us.
Hop over.

404
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:16,580
- Why don't you guys just shave our heads?
- Go on.

405
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,740
We got delicate feelings.

406
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:22,180
You guys seem to think
you're too good for us.

407
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,100
You guys are a bunch of fruits!

408
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:27,260
There you go again, hurting our feelings.

409
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:28,660
Tie their hands.

410
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:33,060
Turkey, I want you to tie
one end of the rope right...

411
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,460
...there.

412
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:35,820
Jeez, Terror...

413
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,180
Turkey, don't do it.

414
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:39,780
Turkey, it's just a little test
to get in to the Baldies.

415
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:41,780
To see how brave a guy can be.

416
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:44,860
I know these guys heard of rock 'n' roll...

417
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:47,180
...but you guys ever hear of rock 'n' cock?

418
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:49,340
How about cock 'n' roll, mothers?

419
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:52,020
Hey, Turkey, do a Boy Scout knot.

420
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,860
Turkey, don't do it, man.

421
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,740
Turkey, you're a Wanderer.

422
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:00,060
Turkey, you fucking homo.

423
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:01,740
Don't get me mad, Joey.

424
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,220
Okay, Turkey, pick up both of the rocks.

425
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:08,100
Any last words to say to your dicks?

426
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:11,140
Say, '"Bye-bye, dick, nice knowing you.'"

427
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:15,020
Turkey, throw the rocks over.

428
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:16,900
Sorry, guys.

429
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,180
Oh, shit.

430
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:26,540
Looks like we got to get shorter twine.

431
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,900
Don't you guys go away.

432
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:35,340
We'll be right back.

433
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,940
Come on, Turkey,
I got a soft spot in my heart for you.

434
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:44,100
- What do we do now?
- Can't get anybody to help us, Richie.

435
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,340
They left us here to die of exposure.

436
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:49,900
Don't fuck with the Baldies!
This is just a warning.

437
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:56,220
I'm glad you've come to us finally, Richie.

438
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,700
You've got a good sense of reality.

439
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:02,180
We're gonna help you
with your problem with the Colored.

440
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:03,660
How are you feeling today?

441
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:07,340
- The old bowling arm feeling hot?
- Sure, always hot.

442
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,020
'"Sure, always hot.'"

443
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:13,420
Wasn't so hot last week
against those Long Island guys.

444
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:15,020
Which reminds me...

445
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:17,140
...see who's bowling out there tonight?

446
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:19,420
- No.
- Take a look.

447
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:24,740
Shit.

448
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:28,380
It's those guys from Long Island.

449
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,700
You know what they're doing here?

450
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:34,900
I don't know.

451
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,700
They've come here for a rematch.

452
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:40,180
Mr. Galasso, those guys are too good.
They killed us last week.

453
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,220
You know, Richie...

454
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,380
...you need some confidence.

455
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,060
The other kid can wait here.

456
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,700
You guys are gonna win big tonight.

457
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:00,740
Are you kidding, Peppy?
These guys are good enough to be pros.

458
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:04,060
My instinct is they is pros.
Chubby checked up on them.

459
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:06,100
They go around to the different lanes.

460
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:09,340
They hustle the house bowlers.
They hustle the hustlers.

461
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:12,620
- They are greedy boys.
- What's Chubby gonna do?

462
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,740
Chubby got a way of creating miracles.

463
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,940
What'll it be?

464
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:27,980
Who is this?

465
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,260
Five big ones?

466
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,420
- We ain't got that much.
- No?

467
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,340
What do you got?

468
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,500
Twenty-five hundred.

469
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,380
Twenty-five hundred.

470
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:42,860
Guess that'll have to do.

471
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,940
We'll leave the money there.

472
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:47,980
Whoa, pal. We get to pick the alley, right?

473
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:51,100
Anything! Come on, you guys gonna play?
Let's cut the bullshit.

474
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:55,260
Wanna keep score, too? Go ahead.
I'm just a dumb Guinea. What do I know?

475
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,260
For all I know, you guys could be pros.

476
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:04,220
What are you guys talking about?

477
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:07,060
Your guys are really good,
is what we're talking about.

478
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:20,860
What's happening?
Where's everybody going?

479
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,940
Just closing for a while, for a little privacy.

480
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,340
What are you doing?

481
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:06,220
You guys are so good, it wouldn't be fair
unless you bowled handicapped.

482
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,100
Twenty pins?

483
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:10,100
Twenty pins?
That's not what I was thinking about.

484
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:11,780
- Fifty pins.
- No good.

485
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,900
What I had in mind was a real handicap.

486
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:41,700
I seen this in my favorite movie.

487
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:43,660
You ever seen The Hustler?

488
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:46,900
Good enough for Paul Newman,
good enough for you.

489
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,420
Now, where was we?

490
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:03,740
Oh, yeah, you guys come to us
with a problem.

491
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,060
We'll take care of it.

492
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:08,500
But remember, we're sportsmen.

493
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:11,740
And we're interested in making
a little bet on you.

494
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,420
Nothing wrong with that, is there?

495
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:20,340
I understand you're playing the Coloreds
in North Bronx Football League soon.

496
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:23,180
I think it would be to our mutual benefit...

497
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,540
...if you won one for the Galassos.

498
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,900
- Don't you?
- Yeah.

499
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,820
There's two kinds of people.

500
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,980
Those with common interests...

501
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:37,580
...and assholes like those hustlers.

502
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:40,540
What I like
about these Colored sportsmen...

503
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:42,860
...is they got common interest.

504
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,620
Not all your Colored are assholes.

505
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:49,500
It's a shame to see kids
beating each other's brains out.

506
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:52,260
Especially when there's
no financial advantage.

507
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:53,900
- Right, Albert?
- Right.

508
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,740
How are you?

509
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:59,220
- How you doing?
- Okay, you?

510
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:02,740
We're gonna have a little football game.
Sporting event.

511
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:06,740
I'm glad these boys brought
us into the picture.

512
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:10,940
It gives these kids a chance to settle
their differences in a beneficial manner.

513
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:14,380
Let's adjourn to the bar for a discussion.

514
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,820
It's cool.

515
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,460
What's all this?

516
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,100
I'm making a banner.

517
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:48,740
Our big game with the Del Bombers
is coming up. You should come, Dad.

518
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:52,260
- It should be a good game.
- Look at me when you talk to me.

519
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:56,820
What kind of drawing you doing?

520
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,660
Why can't you do something normal?

521
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:02,660
A mountain lake, a tree, birds?

522
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,180
That's art.

523
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:07,740
Those aren't normal people you draw.
They're freaks.

524
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:09,420
You hear me?

525
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:10,780
Emilio.

526
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:13,100
Joey, time to eat.

527
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:14,700
They're freaks.

528
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:19,260
Hey, good. I got to drop a few pounds.

529
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:21,340
I got to get more pressed.

530
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:22,580
Come on, let's eat.

531
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:27,300
It's us against the world.

532
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:29,500
I mean, just the Wanderers.

533
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:33,380
- We got to stick together.
- We got to stick it to the Del Bombers.

534
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:35,260
Joey, I got a game for you.

535
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:37,620
- See who can hit the softest.
- Yeah, sure.

536
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:38,940
You go first.

537
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:42,220
That's pretty good. It's my turn now.

538
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:48,740
What did you do that for?
I thought you said the softest.

539
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,340
I did. You win.

540
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:53,820
I'm in love! Look at that.

541
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:55,980
Hey, I'd like to stick it to that.

542
00:37:56,340 --> 00:38:00,060
I'm in love. Hey, you know what, man?

543
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:03,300
Today's the perfect day for elbow-titting.

544
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:05,620
Hey, Perry, pull over.

545
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:33,340
Watch it!

546
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:36,900
Watch where you're going!
Don't people look where they're going?

547
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:39,180
Watch it in the future!

548
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:47,420
- You get any tit?
- She had nice ones.

549
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,980
She didn't know what was happening.

550
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,020
Who's next?

551
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:51,700
Perry, you go.

552
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:54,340
- Me? No.
- Come on.

553
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:57,820
What are you, chicken?

554
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,380
Chicken?

555
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:02,220
Free feels, right in the street?

556
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,460
Too late.

557
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:09,100
Quit bothering me!

558
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:11,420
Don't be afraid, all right?

559
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,060
Watch this.

560
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:22,740
Here goes the elbow-titting champion
of the Bronx.

561
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:30,620
Hey, Joey, get a good one.

562
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:33,380
Do it, Joey baby!

563
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,900
You boys are pigs!

564
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:56,380
You have no respect!

565
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:57,620
Lady, I'm sorry!

566
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,940
- You boys are pigs!
- Yes, ma'am.

567
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:15,340
I never realized how dangerous
elbow-titting was.

568
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:19,540
You win a few, and you lose a few.

569
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:24,540
- Don't hit me.
- Look at that!

570
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:28,020
- Richie, your turn.
- No, no.

571
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,980
Come on, chickenshit.

572
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:35,260
Hey, come on, let's go.

573
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:46,460
'"Hello, hello...

574
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:47,660
'"...hello! '"

575
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:50,140
- Watch where you're going.
- You get a good one?

576
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,580
What do you mean?

577
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:54,500
- I bet you think that's funny.
- What are you talking about?

578
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:57,900
I'm sorry I bumped into you.

579
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:00,660
You think I bump into every girl
out on the street?

580
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:04,500
No, just the ones you're trying to
cop a free feel from.

581
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:07,420
I wasn't trying to do it...

582
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:10,420
Bullshit. Aren't you a little old
to be doing stuff like this?

583
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,580
Where I'm from, they call it molesting.

584
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:13,980
Where are you from?

585
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,700
Come on. Scram, pal.

586
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:18,380
What school do you go to?

587
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:21,460
- Look, whatever your name is...
- Richie. What's yours?

588
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:26,740
Nina. I don't talk to every guy
who tries to elbow-tit me...

589
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:28,460
What is this?

590
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:31,740
I know this, great book.

591
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:33,940
The whole thing, or just the dirty parts?

592
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:36,420
Come on, Nina,
don't take me over the coals.

593
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:39,820
Can't you have a straight talk about
books with a molester like me?

594
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:43,740
Sex fiend, hey, over here!

595
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:47,460
I hear your mom calling you, Richie!

596
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:50,620
Your friends want you back.

597
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:53,580
- You tell them everything?
- Are you kidding?

598
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:54,740
Just the dirty parts.

599
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:58,300
I think we should
see each other again sometime.

600
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:01,220
I've got to go, I've had hard day.

601
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:03,220
Hey, I want you to meet a friend.

602
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:06,500
- Joey, meet Nina.
- Hey, Nina.

603
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:09,820
You wouldn't know it to look at him,
but he's a great artist.

604
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:12,420
I think you two could hit it off.

605
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,860
- I've got to get going.
- Give us your number, okay?

606
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:17,180
I'm not giving you my number.
Hey, do you mind?

607
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:19,700
- Off the car, big fellow.
- Joey, give her your number.

608
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:21,620
Maybe she'd like to go and party with you.

609
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:23,740
- My number?
- Yeah, K-0505-64.

610
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:25,300
K-0505-64!

611
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:28,540
That's my number, K-0505-64.
You got that?

612
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:30,460
Think she'll call?

613
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:32,020
Sure she will.

614
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:39,700
Richie, you're a true Wanderer.

615
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:42,060
I hate to see one like that get away.

616
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:44,020
Let's go.

617
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,100
We'll get them for you, Joey.

618
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:54,940
Don't let her get away.

619
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:56,820
She was something else.

620
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:04,140
Richie, now I think I know
what you mean by true love.

621
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:07,340
- There she goes.
- Don't lose her.

622
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:23,100
Where the hell are we, man?

623
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:26,700
Is that her ahead of us, there?
Thought it was, but it ain't.

624
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:29,460
Perry, where are you taking us?

625
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:32,540
I don't know my way around here.
I thought you were gonna tell me.

626
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:36,180
- I got to get home. I got to go to work.
- It's getting late.

627
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:39,500
- My old man is going to kill me.
- Fucking relax.

628
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:43,300
Jesus, come on.

629
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:46,780
We'll find our way out of here.

630
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:49,300
Let's ask that lady up there.

631
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:56,020
Forget about it.

632
00:44:57,460 --> 00:44:58,740
Jesus.

633
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:07,780
Look out! Watch it, look out!

634
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:10,500
Shit!

635
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:19,540
I think I know where we are.

636
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:21,260
Ducky Boys!

637
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:23,300
Shit, those are Ducky Boys.

638
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:25,660
Let's get the hell out of here!

639
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:31,060
Get the fuck out of here!

640
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:34,140
You little prick.

641
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:37,020
- Perry, get back here!
- You can't talk?

642
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:45,580
Perry, no!

643
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:52,020
Perry!

644
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:15,140
Get in the car!

645
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:19,660
Get the fuck out of here!

646
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:35,060
Get him to a hospital! Emergency.

647
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:44,660
We got to get him to a hospital.

648
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:03,260
I ain't telling my ma about this.

649
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:07,060
The doctor said it ain't good
for the high blood pressure.

650
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:10,300
What are you gonna do? Wear gloves?
Stay here.

651
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:14,500
I'm going upstairs
to see if the coast is clear.

652
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,620
Old man'll kill me for coming in this late.

653
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:22,940
Emilio, I'll see you tomorrow.

654
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:25,980
Bring me a little something, will you?

655
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:27,820
Honey.

656
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:42,420
- Joey, what is it? What's the matter?
- Nothing.

657
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:45,900
Nothing. It's okay.

658
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:51,620
Daddy, I know. No talking in the hallways.

659
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:56,220
You got a call, some dame's calling.
Sounds like a librarian.

660
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:59,500
You got books out? Come on, get inside.

661
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:02,140
Perry, is that you, honey?

662
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:08,860
- Hello?
- Hi, is this Joey?

663
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:12,260
- Yeah.
- This is Nina, we met today.

664
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:15,820
Oh, yeah. Yeah, right.

665
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:18,940
I thought I'd call you up,
you said something about a party.

666
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:20,180
Who'll be there?

667
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:23,900
All the guys. Richie, the first guy
you met on the street today.

668
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:26,740
- Yeah.
- He'll be there. Great guy.

669
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:28,220
- You liked him?
- Yeah.

670
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:38,260
Joey, what are you so nervous about?

671
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:40,220
Jumping around and shit.

672
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:41,820
I got to take a piss.

673
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:44,980
She'll be here in a minute.
Listen, I want to tell you something.

674
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:47,460
I think we got it made
with this chick, you know?

675
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:50,460
- She called you up the other day, right?
- Yeah, right.

676
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:52,660
She's coming to get us for the party?

677
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:55,740
- What are you going to do?
- What do you mean?

678
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:58,900
You need a game plan.
How else are you gonna get laid?

679
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:03,180
I can take care of myself.
Do you know so much about it?

680
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:06,900
Forget it. I'm just trying
to tell you how to get the job done.

681
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:10,060
Do me a favor, keep your mouth shut.
You sound like my mother.

682
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:13,340
Your mother? Tell her she forgot
her shoes under my bed last night.

683
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:17,180
Your mother's got a mattress
on the back of the curbside...

684
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:19,100
Leave the hair alone, will you!

685
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:21,660
- Quit acting like a faggot!
- You wish.

686
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:24,580
- You blow.
- You wish.

687
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:25,940
Here she is.

688
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:29,620
Hi, Nina.

689
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:32,420
- Get in back.
- And leave my main man up here alone?

690
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:35,340
Let's go, we're late already.

691
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:37,060
How you doing, baby?

692
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:41,620
What is this shit on the radio?
Ain't you got some decent music?

693
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:43,500
I'll change the station.

694
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:48,060
All right. Rock 'n' roll, that's more like it.

695
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:50,060
Come on, let's go.

696
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:53,180
- Straight ahead?
- Go left at the corner.

697
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:07,420
Over here. Pull over behind this car.

698
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:08,500
Right here.

699
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:10,260
- What is this car?
- It's my parents'.

700
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:12,220
I borrow it when they go out of town.

701
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:14,100
They're out of town?

702
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:18,940
- Get down.
- What's wrong?

703
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:22,140
Stay down, it's Galasso.
We don't want them to see us.

704
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:24,420
- Who?
- It's Despie's parents.

705
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:31,100
He doesn't want us to break training.
He's got cash riding on us.

706
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:33,780
That dress has got real class.

707
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:37,580
Shall we?

708
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:46,140
- Goddamn, Richie.
- New undies for your birthday, Joey.

709
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:54,820
Can I get out of here?
I can't breath down here.

710
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:02,620
What's going on? Is the coast clear?

711
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:13,580
Come on, they're gone.

712
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:18,140
Okay, let's Wampo!

713
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:29,500
Okay, Popeye.

714
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:33,900
Cleopatra.

715
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:37,500
Eye-line turn.

716
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:47,860
Popeye.

717
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:50,820
Cleopatra.

718
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:00,980
Sweep the floor.

719
00:52:01,180 --> 00:52:03,540
Hey, look who's here.

720
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:11,820
How you doing, man?

721
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:21,060
Jesus, what the hell is that?

722
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:23,500
- That's the woman I know?
- A woman?

723
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:25,620
That's what it looked like, kid.

724
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:29,260
If your pants were any tighter,
we'd be able to see the veins in your balls.

725
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:30,620
Didn't know you were looking!

726
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:33,180
Joey! Joey!

727
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:36,260
I didn't know Purina made sports jackets.

728
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:38,260
I didn't know Purina made bad breath.

729
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:53,780
Richie!

730
00:52:57,580 --> 00:52:58,540
Come here.

731
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:08,700
Do you want to dance, Joey?

732
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:11,580
I'm not very good.
Maybe when a slow one comes on.

733
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:23,020
Thanks, man.

734
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:35,540
Thanks, guys.

735
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:41,020
I've got an urge tonight to maybe...

736
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:44,500
...go out tonight and...

737
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:47,420
...stomp some ass. I just got to...

738
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:49,740
...just rumble.

739
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:53,180
Break some heads. Know what I mean?

740
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:55,940
I know what you mean.
I got an urge, too, man.

741
00:53:56,180 --> 00:53:58,700
I know where
there's a Wanderers party tonight.

742
00:53:58,780 --> 00:54:00,460
The little guys.

743
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:02,780
They're a bunch of pussies.

744
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:05,660
Go out, stomp some ass.

745
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:08,820
Maybe even get laid. Sorry, Peewee.

746
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:11,780
I didn't mean it. I just got an urge.

747
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:15,100
- You guys wanna fight?
- Yeah, we wanna fight.

748
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:17,060
You got to be kidding, pal.

749
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:19,580
- You gonna fight us?
- I ain't talking about me.

750
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:21,820
I'm talking about the toughest guys
in the world.

751
00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:25,820
Man, who you talking about?
Nobody's tougher than the Baldies.

752
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:28,860
Why don't you guys come in here?

753
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:31,020
Come on.

754
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:34,500
I've always wondered what you do in here.
Jerk off?

755
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:36,340
Guys...

756
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:39,180
...I got a way you can stomp
all the ass you want...

757
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:42,340
...and make the world safe for democracy
at the same time.

758
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:44,860
Here you are, gentlemen.

759
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:49,020
Pass those out. Here you go.

760
00:54:52,340 --> 00:54:53,300
Thanks, man.

761
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:56,420
Come on, girls. Get moving.

762
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:06,300
Buddy, come on, babe.

763
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:18,540
Joey, it's so noisy down here.

764
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:21,980
Do you suppose she'd mind
if we went upstairs to talk?

765
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:24,420
No. Hey, Rich...

766
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:28,180
We're gonna go upstairs to talk.

767
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:32,300
Just don't get any jizzy marks
on the Galassos' bed.

768
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:34,460
I'll make you eat it off with a spoon.

769
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:36,460
Hey, good luck.

770
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:39,900
My daddy will kill me
if they make a mess upstairs.

771
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:42,100
They won't, don't worry about it.

772
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:44,740
Maybe we should go upstairs, too.

773
00:55:45,060 --> 00:55:47,260
'"I swear as a citizen of the United States.'"

774
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:51,420
'"I swear as a citizen of the United States.'"

775
00:55:52,460 --> 00:55:55,820
After signing this document,
you'll become Marines.

776
00:55:56,660 --> 00:55:58,660
Terror, don't do it!

777
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:02,100
'"I swear that I have never been...

778
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:04,340
'"I swear that I have never been...

779
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:06,540
'"...a member of the Communist party.'"

780
00:56:06,740 --> 00:56:09,860
'"...a member of the Communist Party.'"

781
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:13,980
At least you guys don't need no haircuts.

782
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:16,860
Terror, you know what you've just done?

783
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:19,100
You've just joined the fucking Marines.

784
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:21,020
You baboon.

785
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:24,860
You know what I think we just done?

786
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:26,140
What?

787
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:28,980
I think we just joined the fucking Marines.

788
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:34,700
I hope you know what we just done,
is just a joke.

789
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:36,740
Sorry, boys.

790
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:39,100
What do you mean, '"sorry, boys'"?

791
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:40,980
I ain't even 21.

792
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:42,540
You ain't got to be.

793
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:46,660
Come on, Mister, give them a break!

794
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:48,020
Them's the rules.

795
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:49,860
My mother will die without me.

796
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:53,260
- Should've thought of that before.
- What did you say about my mother?

797
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:55,100
Get out of here.

798
00:56:57,620 --> 00:57:00,420
Don't worry.
The Marines will make men out of you.

799
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:04,060
You mothers might enjoy a real war.

800
00:57:08,060 --> 00:57:11,620
Remember, no jewelry, no bobby pins,
none of that kind of stuff.

801
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:15,700
Both socks count as one.
It's got to be authentic article of clothing.

802
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:19,540
How did you guys meet, anyway?

803
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:22,940
We just sort of bumped into each other.

804
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:30,140
- What have you got?
- Pairs of deuces.

805
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:31,580
Pairs of deuces.

806
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:35,540
Too bad. Pair of queens. I beat you.

807
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:38,820
Not so fast, I got four of a kind.

808
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:40,860
Four twos?

809
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:43,260
- Yep.
- Nobody gets four twos.

810
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:47,100
Let me see. A straight is when
you've got numbers in a row, right?

811
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:48,420
You got one?

812
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:50,260
No, but I got something very close.

813
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:52,540
Four, six...

814
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:53,820
...seven, eight and ten.

815
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:55,740
If only I got a five and a nine.

816
00:57:57,380 --> 00:57:59,420
Oh, that's too bad. Too bad.

817
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:06,740
I don't even know you guys.
Do you play with them often, Despie?

818
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:08,700
I never played this before.

819
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:10,660
How'd we get into this, anyway?

820
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:12,260
- Who's deal is it?
- Your deal.

821
00:58:12,380 --> 00:58:13,500
Ladies, ante up.

822
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:22,100
- Joey shed his shirt.
- Shut up, asshole.

823
00:58:24,380 --> 00:58:27,260
Let's go. You gonna play or what?

824
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:29,780
Let's go.

825
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:54,820
What kind of polish is that, Despie?

826
00:59:54,980 --> 00:59:55,940
Glitter.

827
00:59:57,580 --> 00:59:58,820
Glitter!

828
01:00:03,740 --> 01:00:06,300
How do you know when you're flushed?
When you're all red?

829
01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:11,260
It's got to be all the same suit,
like all hearts or all diamonds.

830
01:00:11,380 --> 01:00:12,980
Oh, yeah, I knew that.

831
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:21,980
I've got a real good hand.
Let me see, give me...

832
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:23,260
...four cards.

833
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:25,460
Four? Sure.

834
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:27,420
Richie, give me two.

835
01:00:27,620 --> 01:00:30,220
You can't take any cards
without putting something up.

836
01:00:30,580 --> 01:00:31,980
Still in?

837
01:00:32,140 --> 01:00:34,660
- Come on, let's go.
- I better pass.

838
01:00:34,860 --> 01:00:38,260
Can't get anything back by passing.
You have to win it back.

839
01:00:38,460 --> 01:00:39,780
How come we never win?

840
01:00:41,140 --> 01:00:43,300
Who could say? Confidence...

841
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:44,860
...luck of the draw.

842
01:00:45,340 --> 01:00:47,260
The wheel of fate just keeps spinning.

843
01:00:59,540 --> 01:01:01,180
All right, but don't look.

844
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:38,820
Richie...

845
01:01:45,580 --> 01:01:46,540
Richie!

846
01:01:56,580 --> 01:01:58,540
No fair, you guys are looking.

847
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:02,700
- Are you in, Despie?
- I'm out.

848
01:02:04,580 --> 01:02:05,980
What have you got, Joey?

849
01:02:08,220 --> 01:02:10,580
- I fold.
- What have you got, Nina?

850
01:02:14,780 --> 01:02:16,020
Pretty good. Look.

851
01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:17,820
Not good enough.

852
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:23,140
Not good enough. Full house, beats again.

853
01:02:26,140 --> 01:02:28,980
Hey, something fishy's going on here.

854
01:02:29,140 --> 01:02:31,540
In a couple minutes,
we're gonna be naked, then what?

855
01:02:31,620 --> 01:02:33,100
- What are you doing?
- My deal?

856
01:02:33,220 --> 01:02:35,100
Then we play one more hand.

857
01:02:35,900 --> 01:02:36,700
For what?

858
01:02:39,740 --> 01:02:40,660
For what?

859
01:02:46,580 --> 01:02:48,460
Then we get to do whatever we want to.

860
01:02:49,820 --> 01:02:51,780
- What's the matter with you?
- That's it!

861
01:02:51,940 --> 01:02:55,060
Sex fiends are at it again.
We got to get back to the party!

862
01:02:56,820 --> 01:02:58,700
We've got to get back to the party.

863
01:02:58,780 --> 01:03:01,140
We're at the party.
We're just having some fun.

864
01:03:01,540 --> 01:03:03,140
We don't have to stop playing.

865
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:06,460
We've been lucky. You'll win this next one.

866
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:08,140
A little innocent game.

867
01:03:09,380 --> 01:03:10,460
One more hand.

868
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:12,860
There's nothing going on downstairs.
Come on.

869
01:03:16,140 --> 01:03:18,860
Stay, will you? We'll have some fun.

870
01:03:21,660 --> 01:03:23,780
She's going. Go!

871
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:28,540
Despie!

872
01:04:19,260 --> 01:04:21,380
Come on, Terror, get in the car.

873
01:04:22,660 --> 01:04:23,620
Come on.

874
01:04:24,340 --> 01:04:25,700
How about it, baby?

875
01:04:26,180 --> 01:04:28,380
Put me down, Terror. You're drunk.

876
01:04:29,340 --> 01:04:31,540
You don't sound good when you're drunk.

877
01:04:31,740 --> 01:04:34,140
- Come on, man.
- Let's go!

878
01:04:36,180 --> 01:04:38,460
Terror, get in the car, man.

879
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:42,740
Come with us, baby.

880
01:04:58,380 --> 01:04:59,380
Don't go.

881
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:05,460
All right. Let's stomp some ass!

882
01:05:30,580 --> 01:05:32,300
Let's go someplace quiet to talk.

883
01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:33,540
My car.

884
01:05:57,180 --> 01:05:58,980
That's my daddy's cup!

885
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:04,980
Stupid son of a bitch!
How am I gonna get home?

886
01:06:14,740 --> 01:06:15,900
Richie?

887
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:19,300
Richie!

888
01:06:20,420 --> 01:06:21,660
Richie!

889
01:06:21,940 --> 01:06:24,540
I can't forget about you
since the first time I saw you.

890
01:06:35,860 --> 01:06:37,500
Let's go inside!

891
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:41,340
We'll go inside and get some women.
Nookie, right?

892
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:44,060
You go inside, Turkey.
Bring it back out here.

893
01:06:44,220 --> 01:06:46,340
Yeah, man, '"nookie to go,'" right?

894
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:48,820
Excuse me, may I take your orders?

895
01:06:49,700 --> 01:06:52,660
Everything on it, I like it rare.

896
01:06:54,300 --> 01:06:55,940
On the double, Private.

897
01:06:56,060 --> 01:06:57,540
Yeah, man, right.

898
01:06:58,660 --> 01:06:59,780
I'll be right back.

899
01:07:13,060 --> 01:07:14,300
Did you see Richie?

900
01:07:16,940 --> 01:07:17,900
Richie!

901
01:07:19,580 --> 01:07:21,620
I was looking all over for you...

902
01:07:27,300 --> 01:07:28,700
- Hey.
- Hey, what?

903
01:07:29,020 --> 01:07:32,900
What are you looking at?
You're looking at a Baldie now, faggot!

904
01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:38,380
Scumbag, look out the window.

905
01:07:38,700 --> 01:07:39,740
Joey's out there!

906
01:07:41,660 --> 01:07:44,820
Have a nice time, motherfucker.
Terror's gonna settle your ass.

907
01:07:58,980 --> 01:08:02,140
Terror! Roger, where the fuck
are you guys?

908
01:08:09,060 --> 01:08:12,660
Asshole, I don't want to see you
around here, you understand?

909
01:08:14,540 --> 01:08:15,980
Get the fuck out of here.

910
01:08:21,860 --> 01:08:22,980
Terror!

911
01:08:23,340 --> 01:08:25,100
Roger, hey wait up!

912
01:08:26,460 --> 01:08:29,060
Where are you guys going? Terror?

913
01:08:36,660 --> 01:08:40,100
Joey, wait, listen. Joey, come here.

914
01:08:46,620 --> 01:08:48,660
Joey, listen to me.

915
01:08:49,820 --> 01:08:51,860
I had to have a talk with her.

916
01:08:52,060 --> 01:08:55,060
I can't get her out of my mind.
I met her first.

917
01:08:55,940 --> 01:08:59,700
For Christ's sake, Joey, you and me...
I couldn't fight the thing no more.

918
01:08:59,740 --> 01:09:01,700
Don't fucking touch me!

919
01:09:03,740 --> 01:09:07,220
She's just another fucking broad.
She don't matter anyway.

920
01:09:07,260 --> 01:09:08,860
No, she ain't, man. She's special.

921
01:09:20,860 --> 01:09:23,860
You shitheel! You lousy, rotten shitheel.

922
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:28,300
This is what I get for putting out.
I knew this would happen.

923
01:10:04,540 --> 01:10:06,140
Terror!

924
01:10:07,140 --> 01:10:09,060
Baldies!

925
01:10:17,700 --> 01:10:20,180
Terror, where are you?

926
01:10:20,700 --> 01:10:23,700
Roger, get down here,
you bald-headed nigger!

927
01:10:24,060 --> 01:10:25,740
Roger, I'm just kidding, man.

928
01:10:34,300 --> 01:10:35,780
Roger!

929
01:10:37,340 --> 01:10:38,940
Terror!

930
01:11:03,860 --> 01:11:05,540
Terror!

931
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:20,260
I didn't know there was
anyone around here.

932
01:11:20,780 --> 01:11:22,140
I got lost.

933
01:11:25,660 --> 01:11:27,260
I need someone to talk to.

934
01:11:30,380 --> 01:11:31,500
It's cold out.

935
01:11:39,020 --> 01:11:41,060
Where are you coming from?

936
01:11:43,860 --> 01:11:44,820
So what?

937
01:11:45,660 --> 01:11:48,020
You go to high school around here?

938
01:11:49,620 --> 01:11:50,940
You go to high school?

939
01:11:58,140 --> 01:11:59,620
We can go in the park.

940
01:12:02,020 --> 01:12:04,660
I'm not joking, I'm serious.

941
01:12:06,860 --> 01:12:07,820
Yeah.

942
01:12:22,100 --> 01:12:23,060
Help me!

943
01:13:08,420 --> 01:13:09,380
Terror!

944
01:13:41,020 --> 01:13:42,780
I want to tell you guys something.

945
01:13:44,060 --> 01:13:46,460
It wasn't that bad. Not as you think.

946
01:13:49,100 --> 01:13:50,740
I'm gonna miss Turkey.

947
01:13:52,100 --> 01:13:53,900
Here comes the bastard.

948
01:13:58,260 --> 01:13:59,900
Hey, Richie.

949
01:14:05,660 --> 01:14:07,500
Richie, I got your homework.

950
01:14:20,540 --> 01:14:22,380
Guys, what are you doing?

951
01:15:13,980 --> 01:15:16,780
The President and Mrs. Kennedy...

952
01:15:17,020 --> 01:15:19,180
...just minutes before he was shot.

953
01:15:21,260 --> 01:15:23,140
This is not confirmed.

954
01:15:23,580 --> 01:15:27,420
We have it on
what would normally be good authority...

955
01:15:28,060 --> 01:15:30,220
...that the President has died.

956
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:35,780
However, we repeat, this is not confirmed.

957
01:15:48,740 --> 01:15:50,860
Now, as you can see here...

958
01:15:51,500 --> 01:15:53,620
...Mrs. Kennedy steps into the car...

959
01:15:57,340 --> 01:15:59,660
That's her waving.

960
01:16:03,060 --> 01:16:04,900
That's the President waving.

961
01:17:01,740 --> 01:17:05,140
Richie, you know what true love means?

962
01:17:07,180 --> 01:17:11,060
That it means standing by the person
you love, thick and thin?

963
01:17:11,540 --> 01:17:12,500
Do you?

964
01:17:16,740 --> 01:17:18,020
Hello, Father.

965
01:17:19,940 --> 01:17:21,820
You know what else true love means?

966
01:17:21,940 --> 01:17:26,260
True love for a woman means
having the baby of the man she loves.

967
01:17:30,460 --> 01:17:32,820
Do you know what true love in a man is?

968
01:17:33,180 --> 01:17:34,500
True love in a man...

969
01:17:36,060 --> 01:17:38,980
...is wanting that woman who loves him
to have his baby.

970
01:17:39,900 --> 01:17:43,260
- Don't you feel that's what true love is?
- Oh, yeah. Definitely.

971
01:17:44,940 --> 01:17:45,900
Richie...

972
01:17:46,780 --> 01:17:49,020
...I really feel true love for you.

973
01:17:50,140 --> 01:17:53,100
I'd like to know if you feel true love for me.

974
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:54,740
Sure I do.

975
01:17:55,740 --> 01:17:56,940
Sure you do what?

976
01:17:57,980 --> 01:17:59,100
I really do.

977
01:18:00,220 --> 01:18:01,500
You really do what?

978
01:18:03,700 --> 01:18:05,740
I really feel true love for you, Despie.

979
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:13,220
The parents should be in love.

980
01:18:14,300 --> 01:18:17,260
I mean, when I told my daddy
I thought I was pregnant...

981
01:18:17,580 --> 01:18:20,340
...he told me he thought the parents...
- What?

982
01:18:22,020 --> 01:18:24,700
Richie, my daddy wants to see you.

983
01:18:33,340 --> 01:18:35,100
Look, I ain't no hard guy.

984
01:18:35,580 --> 01:18:37,740
I was your age once.
I used to put them away...

985
01:18:37,820 --> 01:18:40,060
...like there was no tomorrow,
but one thing...

986
01:18:40,460 --> 01:18:42,540
...I never did it with nobody's daughter.

987
01:18:43,740 --> 01:18:47,980
Not only did you do it with my daughter,
but you knocked her up, you dumb wop!

988
01:18:48,220 --> 01:18:51,460
You ain't got nothing up here.
It's all down here.

989
01:18:55,580 --> 01:18:57,900
All right. I ain't no hard guy.

990
01:18:58,220 --> 01:19:00,580
It takes two to tango and all that bullshit.

991
01:19:02,580 --> 01:19:06,620
She's been banging since junior high
and you're the first jerk to get caught.

992
01:19:06,740 --> 01:19:07,860
Daddy, how could you?

993
01:19:07,940 --> 01:19:10,300
Maybe you should've given her
an ankle bracelet.

994
01:19:10,460 --> 01:19:11,980
Stop the jerking off.

995
01:19:13,780 --> 01:19:16,260
The thing is, you knocked her up.

996
01:19:16,820 --> 01:19:19,460
And now you gotta pay the price
and do the right thing.

997
01:19:19,700 --> 01:19:21,260
It's the sportsman's way.

998
01:19:22,860 --> 01:19:24,060
Hey, what's this?

999
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:26,900
Now you're scared.

1000
01:19:50,060 --> 01:19:51,060
Get up!

1001
01:19:53,940 --> 01:19:55,380
To my new son-in-law.

1002
01:20:01,620 --> 01:20:04,140
You'll live in the basement.
We got wood paneling.

1003
01:20:04,740 --> 01:20:06,700
Gloria! Come on down!

1004
01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:08,820
Come on over here, pupsie!

1005
01:20:12,460 --> 01:20:13,820
Hey, do you like clams?

1006
01:20:14,140 --> 01:20:17,780
I'll take us all to City Island
for some clams. I ain't no hard guy.

1007
01:20:22,380 --> 01:20:24,540
- What does it say?
- Eighteen inches.

1008
01:20:24,660 --> 01:20:27,180
Eighteen inches.
You know what it was in '40, '41?

1009
01:20:27,420 --> 01:20:29,780
Seventeen and a half.
In Greece, it was eighteen.

1010
01:20:30,100 --> 01:20:33,620
Did I tell you I seen him the other day?
He's turned into a tub of lard.

1011
01:20:35,580 --> 01:20:38,740
Feel it.
Eighteen inches, right where it counts.

1012
01:20:39,420 --> 01:20:41,740
Who do you think
the judges would vote for now?

1013
01:20:41,860 --> 01:20:43,140
I'll be right down!

1014
01:20:43,420 --> 01:20:45,380
- Yeah!
- Keep it down in there!

1015
01:20:47,900 --> 01:20:50,140
Why don't you go see Joey play, Emilio?

1016
01:20:50,460 --> 01:20:52,020
I don't want to get embarrassed.

1017
01:20:52,100 --> 01:20:54,540
I understand he's good.
You won't get embarrassed.

1018
01:20:54,620 --> 01:20:57,620
- Go on, Emilio.
- Not today. I'm busy.

1019
01:21:07,100 --> 01:21:09,660
'"We're so great! We're first rate! '"

1020
01:21:10,900 --> 01:21:13,540
Shit. Looks like them niggers
ain't gonna show.

1021
01:21:13,740 --> 01:21:15,300
- The chickenshits.
- Yeah.

1022
01:21:15,620 --> 01:21:16,820
Always have been.

1023
01:21:19,580 --> 01:21:20,540
What's that?

1024
01:21:55,620 --> 01:21:58,300
Holy shit! It looks like
they ripped off a circus.

1025
01:22:57,380 --> 01:22:59,900
'"We gotta win, we gotta win,
we gotta really win! '"

1026
01:23:01,100 --> 01:23:02,940
Where's that boyfriend?

1027
01:23:16,060 --> 01:23:17,340
Okay!

1028
01:23:17,460 --> 01:23:19,380
You know why
they call you the Wanderers?

1029
01:23:19,460 --> 01:23:22,140
Because after this game,
you'll '"wander'" what happened.

1030
01:23:22,820 --> 01:23:25,300
Come on, motherfucker! Right now!

1031
01:23:31,300 --> 01:23:32,620
Play ball!

1032
01:23:33,900 --> 01:23:37,020
Come on, break it up.
Break it up. Come on.

1033
01:23:43,740 --> 01:23:46,100
- Give me a 5-2.
- Break!

1034
01:23:57,660 --> 01:23:58,780
All right!

1035
01:25:28,500 --> 01:25:30,580
Thirty-nine!

1036
01:25:38,860 --> 01:25:40,580
Twenty-four!

1037
01:25:48,300 --> 01:25:49,500
Time! Time!

1038
01:25:55,860 --> 01:25:57,380
Fucking protection!

1039
01:25:57,500 --> 01:25:58,820
- Stay in your pocket!
- Pocket?

1040
01:25:58,940 --> 01:26:02,980
You got your hands in my pockets.
You guys block like a bunch of fruits.

1041
01:26:03,140 --> 01:26:06,460
- Don't talk like that.
- I'll talk the way I want, understand?

1042
01:26:06,540 --> 01:26:08,860
- I'm the quarterback!
- Then be the quarterback.

1043
01:26:08,900 --> 01:26:10,860
Shut up, all of you guys!

1044
01:26:11,700 --> 01:26:14,140
Maybe some of you guys got a right
to hate my guts.

1045
01:26:14,420 --> 01:26:16,580
I've been watching.
If we had Joey at halfback...

1046
01:26:16,700 --> 01:26:18,620
...and me at quarterback,
we'd have a chance.

1047
01:26:18,700 --> 01:26:20,620
That's the way it was meant to be.

1048
01:26:21,740 --> 01:26:23,620
I've been thinking a lot about it...

1049
01:26:23,740 --> 01:26:28,500
...and I want to say to Joey here, I'm sorry.
I want to apologize.

1050
01:26:29,980 --> 01:26:31,340
What do you say?

1051
01:26:34,380 --> 01:26:36,180
That's great man, great.

1052
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:39,300
All I want to say is that
whatever I've done is in the past.

1053
01:26:39,740 --> 01:26:41,700
All is forgotten. Okay?

1054
01:26:41,900 --> 01:26:44,300
We've got to win this game
for the Wanderers.

1055
01:26:44,860 --> 01:26:47,420
What do you say?
Wanderers forever, right, Joey?

1056
01:26:50,780 --> 01:26:52,380
Let's kill them!

1057
01:26:54,300 --> 01:26:55,300
Set.

1058
01:26:55,580 --> 01:26:58,900
Strong right, full house.
Wanderers' special, on one, ready?

1059
01:27:25,300 --> 01:27:28,420
Going left, full house, death destruction.

1060
01:27:49,100 --> 01:27:50,780
Tie game, mothers!

1061
01:28:04,220 --> 01:28:05,980
Throw me the goddamn ball!

1062
01:28:13,140 --> 01:28:14,340
You got it, brother.

1063
01:28:20,620 --> 01:28:23,420
- Okay, let's have the ball.
- I ain't going over there.

1064
01:28:23,540 --> 01:28:25,820
You want it, you go get it.

1065
01:28:26,100 --> 01:28:27,780
You guys chickening out?

1066
01:28:27,940 --> 01:28:32,540
Hell, no. There's some short, runny-ass
sucker over there with a big blade.

1067
01:28:32,780 --> 01:28:34,660
- What?
- Yeah.

1068
01:28:36,540 --> 01:28:38,780
- I don't see nothing?
- You don't?

1069
01:29:08,860 --> 01:29:10,180
They're here!

1070
01:29:11,540 --> 01:29:13,420
- Look, they're here!
- What?

1071
01:29:13,700 --> 01:29:15,220
Ducky Boys.

1072
01:29:16,860 --> 01:29:18,180
Where?

1073
01:29:19,780 --> 01:29:22,940
I ain't fucking around, man. He was here.

1074
01:29:23,060 --> 01:29:25,540
Everyone's starting to see things.
What is this?

1075
01:29:25,780 --> 01:29:28,060
Can't we just play some football? Let's go!

1076
01:29:35,020 --> 01:29:35,940
Shit.

1077
01:29:37,460 --> 01:29:38,500
Ducky Boys.

1078
01:29:43,180 --> 01:29:44,660
What are they doing here?

1079
01:29:47,420 --> 01:29:49,380
Where are they all coming from?

1080
01:29:56,660 --> 01:29:58,820
- What are we gonna do?
- Don't run.

1081
01:29:59,660 --> 01:30:01,940
Fight them. We'll stay.

1082
01:30:03,740 --> 01:30:05,660
We're gonna stay. Nobody goes.

1083
01:30:07,180 --> 01:30:08,180
Shit!

1084
01:30:08,380 --> 01:30:10,540
There's hundreds of them.

1085
01:30:34,780 --> 01:30:36,820
I think my mother's calling me.

1086
01:30:37,180 --> 01:30:39,380
I'm thirsty. I think I'm gonna get a Coke.

1087
01:30:46,780 --> 01:30:48,620
They killed Turkey.

1088
01:30:57,100 --> 01:30:59,260
Sons of bitches. Come on!

1089
01:32:01,940 --> 01:32:02,940
Come on!

1090
01:33:01,180 --> 01:33:02,540
Joey!

1091
01:33:13,980 --> 01:33:15,140
Hey, come and play.

1092
01:33:24,460 --> 01:33:26,100
We beat them! We won!

1093
01:33:32,540 --> 01:33:34,580
Come on, fucker sucker!

1094
01:33:35,420 --> 01:33:37,020
Are you okay?

1095
01:33:39,660 --> 01:33:41,300
Hey, we beat them, Dad!

1096
01:34:18,260 --> 01:34:20,500
I tell you, I just ain't going home.

1097
01:34:20,620 --> 01:34:23,260
I don't know what to do,
but I ain't going home.

1098
01:34:23,380 --> 01:34:25,460
It's my poor ma I feel sorry for.

1099
01:34:25,660 --> 01:34:29,020
Twenty years of walking on eggshells
living with that asshole.

1100
01:34:29,220 --> 01:34:32,220
- Where's your ma?
- I don't know.

1101
01:34:32,700 --> 01:34:34,180
She went out for a while.

1102
01:34:34,540 --> 01:34:38,580
- Sleep over. She don't mind.
- What's the matter?

1103
01:34:38,820 --> 01:34:39,780
Nothing.

1104
01:34:41,500 --> 01:34:42,900
Take a swig of this.

1105
01:34:44,780 --> 01:34:47,380
She's got high blood pressure,
something like that?

1106
01:34:50,540 --> 01:34:52,700
- Hey, come on.
- No, really.

1107
01:34:56,020 --> 01:34:58,580
It ain't exactly high blood pressure.

1108
01:34:59,020 --> 01:35:00,180
What is it?

1109
01:35:02,100 --> 01:35:04,180
It's an alcoholic kind of thing.

1110
01:35:07,420 --> 01:35:09,300
Last night, it got real bad.

1111
01:35:14,460 --> 01:35:17,780
She checked in to some kind of hospital.

1112
01:35:20,580 --> 01:35:23,220
Perry, I'm sorry, man.

1113
01:35:24,100 --> 01:35:26,580
Oh, man, there's nothing to be sorry for.

1114
01:35:27,740 --> 01:35:29,420
She's better off.

1115
01:35:29,620 --> 01:35:33,220
It's okay, it happened before.
Don't worry, she'll be fine.

1116
01:35:40,300 --> 01:35:42,700
- I'm taking off.
- What?

1117
01:35:43,740 --> 01:35:46,140
They want me to go back
to Trenton, fucking New Jersey.

1118
01:35:47,220 --> 01:35:50,740
Screw graduating. I've been thinking about
heading out to California anyway.

1119
01:35:50,980 --> 01:35:52,180
California?

1120
01:35:55,660 --> 01:35:57,020
That's it.

1121
01:35:57,180 --> 01:35:59,140
Man, that's a great idea.

1122
01:35:59,340 --> 01:36:02,460
- I'm coming with you.
- No, no.

1123
01:36:02,620 --> 01:36:04,060
I travel alone.

1124
01:36:04,460 --> 01:36:06,780
Besides, I ain't sure I'm going to California.

1125
01:36:08,860 --> 01:36:10,380
Maybe I'll go to China.

1126
01:36:11,260 --> 01:36:13,140
Hey, I was just...

1127
01:36:19,340 --> 01:36:20,580
Perry?

1128
01:36:21,220 --> 01:36:22,140
What?

1129
01:36:25,540 --> 01:36:26,740
I'm scared.

1130
01:36:27,100 --> 01:36:28,900
Hey, what's wrong with that?

1131
01:36:30,220 --> 01:36:31,460
What do you mean?

1132
01:36:32,820 --> 01:36:37,620
Joey, do me a favor. If we travel together,
you have to promise not to be an asshole.

1133
01:36:38,580 --> 01:36:41,220
We'll take off right after
the bachelor party for Richie.

1134
01:36:47,420 --> 01:36:49,660
Tina? Tina?

1135
01:36:49,780 --> 01:36:51,580
- Who's Tina?
- My mom.

1136
01:36:52,100 --> 01:36:54,940
- Who the hell is that?
- It's my dad, Emilio.

1137
01:36:56,340 --> 01:36:57,540
Tina!

1138
01:36:58,900 --> 01:37:00,260
Hey, Tina!

1139
01:37:11,900 --> 01:37:15,460
I thought you told your mother
you were going out bowling tonight?

1140
01:37:15,580 --> 01:37:17,620
You've been lying to her or what?

1141
01:37:17,700 --> 01:37:19,060
Don't come near me.

1142
01:37:19,420 --> 01:37:23,300
What are you talking about? I want to
know why you weren't home for dinner.

1143
01:37:23,740 --> 01:37:26,580
- Don't come near me.
- Leave the kid alone.

1144
01:37:27,660 --> 01:37:29,620
Were you talking to me?

1145
01:37:31,020 --> 01:37:33,060
Didn't your father teach you no manners?

1146
01:37:33,140 --> 01:37:35,580
- Leave the kid alone.
- Perry, he'll kill you.

1147
01:37:35,780 --> 01:37:38,260
That's the trouble with you rotten kids.

1148
01:37:38,980 --> 01:37:42,340
Your fathers are afraid
to kick some sense into your heads.

1149
01:37:43,340 --> 01:37:45,860
Your father must have been
some kind of piss ant...

1150
01:37:46,340 --> 01:37:48,300
There's no sense of humor.

1151
01:37:48,820 --> 01:37:50,780
Come on, what's all this about?

1152
01:38:07,180 --> 01:38:10,300
You shouldn't have done that!
He's your father. Don't forget that.

1153
01:38:10,340 --> 01:38:12,340
I think I killed the bastard.

1154
01:38:13,340 --> 01:38:14,780
Let's get out of here.

1155
01:38:15,580 --> 01:38:16,660
Get out of here!

1156
01:38:18,300 --> 01:38:21,460
- What are we going to do?
- Get to my car.

1157
01:38:30,460 --> 01:38:32,820
'"Hello! '"

1158
01:38:35,780 --> 01:38:38,300
Richie! Sex fiend!

1159
01:38:38,700 --> 01:38:41,500
What are you guys doing here?
You're going to get me fired.

1160
01:38:41,700 --> 01:38:45,020
- What're you doing? What's going on?
- Tell me, did you sleep with her?

1161
01:38:45,060 --> 01:38:46,940
What else are you going to do with her?

1162
01:38:47,020 --> 01:38:49,180
- Fix your hair.
- Come on, let's go.

1163
01:38:50,020 --> 01:38:51,540
Trouble? Where? With who?

1164
01:38:51,700 --> 01:38:53,900
- You're in big trouble.
- You're fine now.

1165
01:38:54,620 --> 01:38:56,500
- Okay, I'm coming.
- Come on, let's go.

1166
01:38:56,860 --> 01:38:59,860
- Comb your hair.
- I'll do it.

1167
01:39:22,900 --> 01:39:26,940
We all chipped in to get you something
for your bachelor party.

1168
01:39:27,020 --> 01:39:28,460
Here you go.

1169
01:39:31,300 --> 01:39:35,700
- Come on, open it.
- This is something you needed all along.

1170
01:39:37,020 --> 01:39:38,740
Dirk, you're my main man.

1171
01:39:39,420 --> 01:39:41,460
That's the least we could have done.

1172
01:39:42,300 --> 01:39:45,500
- Come on, open it.
- Would you open the box?

1173
01:39:48,580 --> 01:39:50,900
We're going to be here all night.

1174
01:39:51,180 --> 01:39:53,500
Sometime today, I want to eat.

1175
01:39:55,020 --> 01:39:57,220
- What is it?
- Open it.

1176
01:40:05,140 --> 01:40:06,700
One more time.

1177
01:40:09,860 --> 01:40:14,620
Fuck you guys. One lousy rubber.
Thanks a lot, you fucking assholes.

1178
01:40:14,700 --> 01:40:16,540
We got you a life-time supply.

1179
01:40:22,940 --> 01:40:25,220
- Talk to you later.
- Come on. You just got here.

1180
01:40:25,460 --> 01:40:26,780
We gotta leave.

1181
01:40:26,820 --> 01:40:30,940
Come on. We'll have a little food,
drink a little wine. We'll have a good time.

1182
01:40:31,420 --> 01:40:35,100
- With all these gold jackets, you know.
- Don't worry about it, man.

1183
01:40:35,420 --> 01:40:38,940
- Let's stay.
- We'll have a good time.

1184
01:40:39,780 --> 01:40:42,620
- We'll hang for a little while.
- Have something to eat.

1185
01:40:43,140 --> 01:40:44,940
Watch yourself. Coming through.

1186
01:40:58,900 --> 01:41:01,220
This is from the guys over there.

1187
01:41:19,380 --> 01:41:21,660
Hey, son-in-law.

1188
01:41:24,580 --> 01:41:29,140
I was talking with my brothers.
They agreed to bring you in.

1189
01:41:30,260 --> 01:41:31,980
It means you're going to do all right.

1190
01:41:38,180 --> 01:41:39,900
This fits real nice.

1191
01:41:41,460 --> 01:41:43,180
You'll grow into it.

1192
01:41:43,340 --> 01:41:47,580
Once you're married to my daughter,
you'll never wash another dish in your life.

1193
01:42:00,300 --> 01:42:01,580
Where are you going?

1194
01:42:02,140 --> 01:42:04,540
Just getting some fresh air.
I'll be right back.

1195
01:42:27,980 --> 01:42:29,460
Hey, Nina.

1196
01:42:31,620 --> 01:42:32,580
Nina!

1197
01:42:33,740 --> 01:42:35,540
Nina, wait a minute...

1198
01:42:40,060 --> 01:42:42,700
I'm sorry, ma'am.
I thought you were somebody else.

1199
01:42:45,340 --> 01:42:47,220
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

1200
01:44:26,780 --> 01:44:29,260
Hey, where are you guys going?

1201
01:44:33,980 --> 01:44:36,340
- We got to be on our way.
- On your way?

1202
01:44:36,420 --> 01:44:37,820
Yeah, we...

1203
01:44:38,260 --> 01:44:39,900
...we just came by to wish you luck.

1204
01:44:40,060 --> 01:44:43,260
What're you talking about?
What's going on?

1205
01:44:51,300 --> 01:44:53,180
Hey, Peewee, get out of there.

1206
01:44:55,540 --> 01:44:58,100
Come on, Joey. Leave me alone, will you?

1207
01:44:59,260 --> 01:45:01,700
Hey, Joey, what're you doing?

1208
01:45:03,700 --> 01:45:05,900
You don't talk without your Baldies.

1209
01:45:08,980 --> 01:45:10,620
Leave me alone.

1210
01:45:11,620 --> 01:45:14,260
Hey, man, you owed me, you big shithead.

1211
01:45:19,100 --> 01:45:20,620
Come on, don't cry.

1212
01:45:23,620 --> 01:45:25,180
I'm sorry.

1213
01:45:27,860 --> 01:45:30,300
All that time I was with the Baldies...

1214
01:45:32,060 --> 01:45:35,100
...and not one of them even
drops me a card.

1215
01:45:35,300 --> 01:45:36,260
Hey.

1216
01:45:38,140 --> 01:45:42,260
- I'll drop you a card, all right?
- Hey, Joey. Come on, man, let's go.

1217
01:45:42,940 --> 01:45:44,060
Where are you going?

1218
01:45:47,780 --> 01:45:49,900
Hey, where do you guys
think you're going?

1219
01:45:50,340 --> 01:45:53,220
- You can't go, man.
- I gotta go.

1220
01:45:56,620 --> 01:45:58,940
But, if you ever need us...

1221
01:45:59,820 --> 01:46:01,740
...just whistle loud. We'll be there.

1222
01:46:02,620 --> 01:46:06,060
You can't do it to me. Fucking little guy.

1223
01:46:08,060 --> 01:46:08,980
Come here.

1224
01:46:10,620 --> 01:46:12,500
Just remember one thing.

1225
01:46:14,140 --> 01:46:15,540
Wanderers forever.

1226
01:46:22,940 --> 01:46:24,660
Don't take any wooden pussy.

1227
01:46:29,780 --> 01:46:32,940
Hey, come on back, will you, guys?
Come on.

1228
01:46:38,220 --> 01:46:42,060
Come on with me. Everybody's inside.
Quit your fucking crying.

1229
01:46:42,980 --> 01:46:45,180
- Thank you so much.
- It was a wonderful evening.

1230
01:46:45,500 --> 01:46:46,900
- I'm glad. Come back.
- Thank you.

1231
01:46:46,940 --> 01:46:48,900
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1232
01:46:49,180 --> 01:46:50,620
We'll come back and see you soon.

1233
01:46:50,700 --> 01:46:52,700
- Take care of yourself.
- Thank you.

1234
01:46:53,500 --> 01:46:56,820
- Is this the guy?
- This is the guy. The man of the hour.

1235
01:46:56,980 --> 01:46:59,740
Ladies and gentlemen,
this young man is getting married...

1236
01:47:00,660 --> 01:47:03,060
...and I don't know
what advice we can give him.

1237
01:47:03,100 --> 01:47:06,260
- Don't do it!
- What's your favorite song, Richie?

1238
01:47:06,500 --> 01:47:09,740
- I ain't got one.
- Well, I got one for you.

1239
01:47:09,860 --> 01:47:13,780
And I want you all, ladies and gentlemen,
to join in as I sing.

1240
01:49:17,860 --> 01:49:22,620
'"San Francisco, 2,941 miles.'"
Do we got enough gas?

1241
01:49:23,100 --> 01:49:24,780
Hey, Joey, do me a favor.

1242
01:49:25,020 --> 01:49:28,460
If we're going to travel together,
you have to promise not to be an asshole.

1243
01:49:28,580 --> 01:49:30,340
Yeah, yeah. I know, I know.

1244
01:49:31,340 --> 01:49:41,340
