<i># Yet no tears,</i>

<i># The flight of the wild geese</i>

00:01:23,644 --> 00:01:26,672

Colonel Faulkner

26
00:02:52,222 --> 00:02:54,213
- You're late
- Sorry

27
00:02:55,062 --> 00:02:56,925
We thought it better for you to come

28
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:59,021
into the country without
going through immigration

29
00:02:59,182 --> 00:03:00,695
Took a bit of doing

30
00:03:01,062 --> 00:03:02,177
I assume you're keen

31
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:06,341
I am. I'm also cold and tired.
Could we move rather rapidly on?

32
00:03:30,301 --> 00:03:31,416
This way, sir

33
00:03:42,061 --> 00:03:43,335
Colonel Faulkner,

34
00:03:44,301 --> 00:03:45,780
I'm Thomas Balfour

35
00:03:45,941 --> 00:03:46,851
How do you do

36
00:03:47,021 --> 00:03:48,852
You'll be meeting Sir Edward Matherson

37
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:50,693
Matherson the merchant banker?

38
00:03:50,861 --> 00:03:52,294
That's correct

39
00:03:59,171 --> 00:04:00,205
Faulkner...

40
00:04:02,301 --> 00:04:04,098
What do I call you? "SIR Edward"?

41
00:04:04,821 --> 00:04:05,970
You do

42
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:08,612
You drink whiskey, I take it,
soda or water?

43
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:10,533
Large and straight, thank you

44
00:04:10,901 --> 00:04:12,380
Good of you to come at such short notice

45
00:04:12,581 --> 00:04:14,970
That depends on your definition of good

46
00:04:15,461 --> 00:04:19,089
A first-class air ticket and an unsigned
cheque for £2,000

47
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,369
are persuasive

48
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:22,719
I assume that's for
my time and my trouble

49
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,858
And a rather rough meal on the plane

50
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:27,858
Would you be good enough to sign?

51
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:29,929
Thank you

52
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:34,814
Another, please

53
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,456
Please, feel free with my whisky

54
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:38,935
I will

55
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:45,179
Thanks I'm dry when I work

56
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:46,969
So I've heard

57
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,216
There's a special clause in my contracts

58
00:04:49,217 --> 00:04:51,253
that says that my liver is to be
buried separately, with honors

59
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,898
I'm not a very humorous man

60
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,336
So I've noticed

61
00:04:56,140 --> 00:05:00,531
Tell me what happened with your contract
with Julius Limbani

62
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,610
You know very well what happened

63
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,253
You didn't pick my name out of a hat

64
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,018
It was a disastrous failure

65
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,939
But not my failure. He didn't arrive

66
00:05:15,859 --> 00:05:16,769
Don't move

67
00:05:22,219 --> 00:05:24,574
Mr. Limbani, sorry to interrupt your nap

68
00:05:24,739 --> 00:05:29,051
We are going to divert the plane. An old
friend of yours is waiting for you

69
00:05:29,219 --> 00:05:30,777
Just sit quietly

70
00:05:32,459 --> 00:05:33,892
That was two years ago

71
00:05:34,099 --> 00:05:37,296
I've got your autograph Sir Edward. Why?

72
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:41,616
- Copper.
- Copper?

73
00:05:43,339 --> 00:05:47,491
Now let's see if I can put all of the
pieces together

74
00:05:48,219 --> 00:05:50,255
just for the exercise

75
00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:53,891
General Ndofa was the most corrupt
dictator in Africa,

76
00:05:54,059 --> 00:05:56,015
deposing Limbani as head of state

77
00:05:56,539 --> 00:05:57,938
Do you mind if I cut through all of this?

78
00:05:58,339 --> 00:05:59,374
Uganda agreed

79
00:05:59,579 --> 00:06:01,570
to hold Limbani for them

80
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:03,849
then they refused to give him back

81
00:06:04,019 --> 00:06:07,853
They announced that he died of a heart
attack, then they set him free

82
00:06:08,259 --> 00:06:09,293
The dogs

83
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:13,736
Ndofa can't stand the chance of Limbani
reincarnated taking over his country

84
00:06:13,938 --> 00:06:17,248
So he's offered some of our copper
concessions

85
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:20,535
in return for the secret delivery
of Limbani into his hands

86
00:06:20,938 --> 00:06:24,294
And you want me to intercept him
and deliver him to you

87
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:25,288
Correct

88
00:06:26,258 --> 00:06:27,213
Where do I find him?

89
00:06:27,738 --> 00:06:31,651
He'll be moved across the border and
taken to an army barracks at Zembala

90
00:06:31,818 --> 00:06:33,809
Now Ndofa leaves Gurundi the same day

91
00:06:33,978 --> 00:06:37,050
and personally execute Limbani and
scatter his ashes

92
00:06:37,938 --> 00:06:39,132
Any questions?

93
00:06:40,698 --> 00:06:42,256
For the moment, just two

94
00:06:42,858 --> 00:06:47,534
First when can we confirm the exact
date of arrival of Limbani at Zembala?

95
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:48,494
7 days in advance

96
00:06:48,698 --> 00:06:50,256
- guaranteed
- Good

97
00:06:50,418 --> 00:06:52,613
And two, can you hold General Ndofa in
Gurundi

98
00:06:52,818 --> 00:06:54,968
while I'm grabbing Limbani?

99
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:56,692
That can be done

100
00:06:57,698 --> 00:07:00,451
Excellent. That's all for now

101
00:07:00,618 --> 00:07:02,290
Don't you wish to discuss

102
00:07:02,498 --> 00:07:03,408
your fees and expenses?

103
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:06,970
Well first of all I have to determine
if the project is feasible

104
00:07:07,137 --> 00:07:08,934
If it is, I'll send you my account

105
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,206
I don't discuss fees, I get what I want

106
00:07:10,417 --> 00:07:12,328
I realize you get paid for
risking your life

107
00:07:12,497 --> 00:07:16,206
I do hope it's not going to be
too valuable. Goodbye Faulkner

108
00:07:16,377 --> 00:07:19,494
We shan't be seeing each other again,
it's been a great pleasure

109
00:07:26,337 --> 00:07:27,326
Here we are

110
00:07:27,857 --> 00:07:28,846
Here?

111
00:07:31,137 --> 00:07:32,092
This is it?

112
00:07:32,257 --> 00:07:34,713
You're too well known to stay
in a first class hotel

113
00:07:34,714 --> 00:07:36,569
Now in here is a passport,
driving license

114
00:07:36,737 --> 00:07:40,127
all the usual papers and a 'phone number
where I can always be reached

115
00:07:40,297 --> 00:07:42,208
You're to deal directly with me

116
00:07:42,377 --> 00:07:44,686
It's my job to provide you with
everything you need

117
00:07:44,857 --> 00:07:46,256
I've got some jobs for you immediately

118
00:07:46,457 --> 00:07:48,527
I want a detailed map of the area around
Zembala,

119
00:07:48,737 --> 00:07:50,932
a scale model of the barracks

120
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,934
plus all the details you can get
me on the garrison strength

121
00:07:54,177 --> 00:07:55,895
- It will be delivered by hand.
- Good

122
00:07:56,097 --> 00:07:57,410
Now I want you to find me two men

123
00:07:57,411 --> 00:08:00,648
First Rafer Janders. If he's
alive, he's here in London

124
00:08:01,497 --> 00:08:03,566
Rafer Janders...

125
00:08:03,736 --> 00:08:05,454
Fair-haired, cigarette-holder,
wears glasses?

126
00:08:05,656 --> 00:08:08,170
That's the man. This is going to be a
tough assignment

127
00:08:08,336 --> 00:08:09,815
No Rafer Janders, no contract

128
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:12,965
I'll call you about him within an hour.
And the other one?

129
00:08:13,176 --> 00:08:14,086
Shawn Fynn

130
00:08:14,296 --> 00:08:15,729
Very good looking

131
00:08:15,896 --> 00:08:18,205
I know the name Shawn Fynn

132
00:08:18,856 --> 00:08:20,084
I'll do my best but he's a problem

133
00:08:20,496 --> 00:08:22,061
Find him - same goes for him

134
00:08:22,062 --> 00:08:23,966
No Shawn - no deal

135
00:09:15,135 --> 00:09:16,124
Sit down

136
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,084
Randy, you don't come in here!

137
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:29,766
We got a problem, Mr. Martinelli

138
00:09:33,415 --> 00:09:35,326
I'm really sorry

139
00:09:37,135 --> 00:09:38,250
Go

140
00:09:38,455 --> 00:09:40,286
Go on. Go on. I'll be out in a minute

141
00:09:41,055 --> 00:09:42,454
Close the door

142
00:09:44,255 --> 00:09:47,292
So? Go ahead. What is it?

143
00:09:47,975 --> 00:09:49,727
You should've told me I was carrying
heroin

144
00:09:50,455 --> 00:09:51,968
I said: "No drugs"

145
00:09:52,135 --> 00:09:54,171
What did you think the delivery was for?
Hershey bars?

146
00:09:55,894 --> 00:09:57,452
I thought it was cash?

147
00:09:58,214 --> 00:10:01,092
I don't push drugs, ever.
It's against my religion

148
00:10:01,294 --> 00:10:03,410
You're telling me what you do
or don't do for me?

149
00:10:04,934 --> 00:10:05,730
More or less

150
00:10:07,533 --> 00:10:11,483
Randy, break any two items
you like on this man and throw him out

151
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:12,843
If I ever see your face again,

152
00:10:13,054 --> 00:10:14,612
you're dead

153
00:10:16,534 --> 00:10:19,287
Put your hands on your head.
You, move over with him!

154
00:10:19,694 --> 00:10:20,524
On your head

155
00:10:21,974 --> 00:10:24,852
Shawn, take it easy,
he's just a snot-nosed kid

156
00:10:25,014 --> 00:10:26,413
His old man is something very special

157
00:10:26,614 --> 00:10:28,605
- back in the States
- Have you finished?

158
00:10:29,134 --> 00:10:30,089
Here

159
00:10:32,734 --> 00:10:33,849
Open it

160
00:10:34,854 --> 00:10:35,650
Open it!

161
00:10:41,454 --> 00:10:44,969
I poured all the envelopes into one bag,
it's more convenient

162
00:10:46,494 --> 00:10:51,124
Here I am just starting to work
for you two "beauties"

163
00:10:51,294 --> 00:10:53,443
And I make my first contact

164
00:10:54,133 --> 00:10:55,930
It was a young girl

165
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:58,563
She was alone on a bed,

166
00:10:58,733 --> 00:10:59,882
dying

167
00:11:00,573 --> 00:11:01,767
And that's when I opened the package

168
00:11:02,853 --> 00:11:04,127
You boys are pushing bad stuff

169
00:11:05,533 --> 00:11:08,923
So what I'd like you to do is
each eat half of it

170
00:11:09,533 --> 00:11:10,329
You're crazy!

171
00:11:10,733 --> 00:11:13,486
She was barely 19.
Now on your knees and eat!

172
00:11:14,973 --> 00:11:15,689
You too

173
00:11:24,773 --> 00:11:25,762
Oh God Please...

174
00:11:26,373 --> 00:11:30,002
I hope you've got a big appetite son.
Because it's all yours

175
00:11:31,013 --> 00:11:32,002
Please

176
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:34,564
Her words exactly

177
00:11:34,733 --> 00:11:35,722
Now, eat it

178
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:37,561
Now do it!

179
00:11:43,573 --> 00:11:44,572
All of it!

180
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:48,483
Pour it down

181
00:12:02,132 --> 00:12:04,692
You look like you need a good
stomach pump

182
00:12:05,132 --> 00:12:06,406
That had strychnine in it

183
00:12:08,932 --> 00:12:12,561
But still, a little suffering
is good for the soul

184
00:12:14,292 --> 00:12:16,328
You have another 20 minutes

185
00:12:16,492 --> 00:12:17,811
Have fun

186
00:12:25,972 --> 00:12:27,963
Corner of Riverdale and Hampstead

187
00:12:32,172 --> 00:12:35,562
Emile, why don't we leave the
dishes until later?

188
00:12:35,732 --> 00:12:36,721
Great!

189
00:12:39,412 --> 00:12:41,004
That was pretty good

190
00:12:41,172 --> 00:12:41,968
What do you mean Emile?

191
00:12:42,172 --> 00:12:43,730
That was one of the best meals
I've ever cooked

192
00:12:43,932 --> 00:12:45,206
Cold lobster?

193
00:12:45,411 --> 00:12:47,561
I had to unwrap it didn't I? Come here

194
00:12:53,091 --> 00:12:55,480
You promised me you would
right after dinner

195
00:12:55,651 --> 00:12:56,766
I haven't had my coffee yet

196
00:12:56,931 --> 00:12:58,444
You don't drink coffee

197
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,124
That's true

198
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:01,326
Are you ready?

199
00:13:01,491 --> 00:13:02,970
Sure? OK

200
00:13:03,451 --> 00:13:07,364
- Now when do the school Xmas holidays
start? - 12th December, you know that

201
00:13:07,531 --> 00:13:10,841
- And when do you go back?
- 9th January,

202
00:13:11,011 --> 00:13:12,330
come on, Dad!

203
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:14,288
Now isn't that a fantastic coincidence!

204
00:13:14,931 --> 00:13:16,762
You know, this isn't a bad little
wine really

205
00:13:16,931 --> 00:13:19,650
Why? Dad, please!

206
00:13:20,851 --> 00:13:23,240
OK. This is how it goes

207
00:13:23,411 --> 00:13:27,086
December 13th you, me and some suitcases,
are jumping on board an airplane

208
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:29,441
- Where are we going?
- Wait a minute

209
00:13:29,611 --> 00:13:31,806
That same plane brings us back January 3rd

210
00:13:31,971 --> 00:13:33,006
Skiing!

211
00:13:33,171 --> 00:13:34,570
- You got it!
- In Switzerland?

212
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:35,720
The very same!

213
00:13:35,891 --> 00:13:37,768
Oh boy, that's fantastic!

214
00:13:37,931 --> 00:13:39,125
Oh yes...

215
00:13:41,931 --> 00:13:42,885
Just the two of us?

216
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:45,888
Who else? We'll be staying in a
beautiful little inn

217
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:48,046
I'm so excited, I don't know what to do

218
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:51,606
Why don't you try screaming?
The neighbors are deaf anyway

219
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:03,086
Oh! Not all of the neighbors are deaf

220
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:12,479
Allen!

221
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:16,965
Hey stop it, you're breaking my wallet

222
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:18,639
Come on in

223
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:22,321
- It's good to see you.
- Good to see you too

224
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:23,639
What was all that screaming about?

225
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:27,200
Emile was expressing mild satisfaction.
Emile, come here. This is Mr. Faulkner

226
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:29,486
- This is my son, Emile.
- How are you?

227
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:31,203
Pleased to meet you, sir

228
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:33,640
A by-product of an expensive education

229
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:35,442
What a pity they don't export it

230
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:37,083
Excuse me, sir

231
00:14:39,049 --> 00:14:42,007
- I hope to see you later, sir
- So do I

232
00:14:43,809 --> 00:14:45,037
What a pleasant child

233
00:14:45,209 --> 00:14:46,483
I'll tell you about him later

234
00:14:46,649 --> 00:14:49,641
Now pour me a drink,
sit down, let's talk

235
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:51,278
It's been 9 years

236
00:14:52,129 --> 00:14:54,882
Ten, in fact. Where did they all go?

237
00:14:55,449 --> 00:14:57,724
We'll drink to something

238
00:14:57,929 --> 00:14:58,918
Right?

239
00:14:59,489 --> 00:15:01,798
Let's drink to...

240
00:15:02,009 --> 00:15:04,398
the years that came before the 10

241
00:15:07,689 --> 00:15:09,281
To the next ten weeks

242
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:11,085
What does that mean?

243
00:15:11,289 --> 00:15:13,166
To you, Rafer, my old friend

244
00:15:13,729 --> 00:15:15,367
OK. To me

245
00:15:21,449 --> 00:15:23,485
- Disgusting
- Yes, isn't it?

246
00:15:23,649 --> 00:15:27,039
What do you mean, "the next 10 weeks"?

247
00:15:28,209 --> 00:15:29,881
Come on, Rafer, let's talk

248
00:15:31,909 --> 00:15:34,582
No, Allen I'm not available

249
00:15:34,889 --> 00:15:36,719
I'm trying to go old and grey

250
00:15:36,928 --> 00:15:39,442
I'm searching to see if I can
find my God

251
00:15:39,608 --> 00:15:42,105
I'm trying to learn
how to appreciate life

252
00:15:42,106 --> 00:15:44,602
And practice the art of inner peace

253
00:15:44,768 --> 00:15:47,282
Now you believe all that
is a crock of shit

254
00:15:47,888 --> 00:15:49,003
- I do.
- You're right

255
00:15:49,728 --> 00:15:52,879
All except the "I'm not available".
I'm not

256
00:15:54,488 --> 00:15:56,080
Alright, I guess I can understand that

257
00:15:56,608 --> 00:15:58,087
Well now, tell me, how did you find me?

258
00:15:58,248 --> 00:15:59,397
I asked

259
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:02,676
Tell me, how's that 19 year old
French beauty?

260
00:16:02,848 --> 00:16:06,124
That 19 year old beauty is 29
and she lives in Paris

261
00:16:06,528 --> 00:16:08,086
- She left you?
- Yes

262
00:16:08,288 --> 00:16:10,563
She's Emile's mother She sees him
once or twice a year

263
00:16:10,728 --> 00:16:12,320
I haven't see her since he was two

264
00:16:12,488 --> 00:16:14,046
He goes to boarding school in Kent

265
00:16:14,928 --> 00:16:17,761
What would I do with him full-time?

266
00:16:17,928 --> 00:16:20,078
I love him. He's a wonderful boy

267
00:16:20,248 --> 00:16:23,320
Weekends and holidays are my greatest
moments of my life

268
00:16:23,488 --> 00:16:26,719
I'm taking him skiing for Christmas
3 weeks, leaving December 13th

269
00:16:27,368 --> 00:16:30,440
- December 13th...
- I can't wait

270
00:16:30,648 --> 00:16:32,558
Anyway, enough about me!

271
00:16:32,727 --> 00:16:34,046
How's Jenny?

272
00:16:35,367 --> 00:16:36,595
She died

273
00:16:36,807 --> 00:16:39,002
- 3 years ago.
- How?

274
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:42,005
Some kind of bone cancer,
in a month she was dead

275
00:16:42,647 --> 00:16:44,683
- I'm sorry.
- So am I. She was a good woman

276
00:16:44,847 --> 00:16:47,839
- She was great Allen...
- The subject is closed

277
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:49,801
OK

278
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:51,400
What's done is done

279
00:16:51,887 --> 00:16:53,923
Come on, tell me, how are the kids?

280
00:16:54,727 --> 00:16:57,525
They're alright. Grown up

281
00:16:58,207 --> 00:17:00,004
Don't see them much any more

282
00:17:00,727 --> 00:17:03,036
I think they're not too happy with me

283
00:17:03,207 --> 00:17:04,481
These are beautiful

284
00:17:05,047 --> 00:17:06,799
Yes, they are, aren't they?

285
00:17:06,967 --> 00:17:09,606
I buy them, sell them...
I'm getting pretty good at it

286
00:17:09,767 --> 00:17:12,076
They earn about 15,000 a year

287
00:17:14,727 --> 00:17:17,685
- Julius Limbani is alive.
- I don't care

288
00:17:17,887 --> 00:17:19,218
Yes you do

289
00:17:19,219 --> 00:17:21,880
If there's one African leader you
do care about, it's Julius Limbani

290
00:17:22,087 --> 00:17:24,601
Now I'm telling you, Allen I'm
finished with all of that

291
00:17:24,767 --> 00:17:26,519
I'm getting too old.
By the way, so are you

292
00:17:28,527 --> 00:17:31,802
You know, apart from your
charming personality

293
00:17:31,966 --> 00:17:35,038
and the fact that you're the
finest planner I've ever known

294
00:17:35,206 --> 00:17:39,484
What I've always admired about you,
Rafer, is your idealism

295
00:17:39,646 --> 00:17:40,442
Bollocks

296
00:17:40,646 --> 00:17:42,443
The money wasn't important to you

297
00:17:42,606 --> 00:17:45,120
It was the bad guys
against the good guys

298
00:17:45,286 --> 00:17:47,038
And you were never with the bad guys

299
00:17:47,206 --> 00:17:50,039
Now me, I'd work for anybody,
as long as they paid me

300
00:17:50,206 --> 00:17:52,322
It's an ineradicable flaw in my life

301
00:17:53,126 --> 00:17:55,515
And that's why you've always
impressed me, Rafer, always

302
00:17:56,406 --> 00:17:58,203
I'm glad to hear you say that

303
00:17:58,366 --> 00:18:00,482
Do you know how many times
I've been wrong?

304
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:02,301
Out there somewhere
singing "Hallelujah!"

305
00:18:02,302 --> 00:18:03,956
fighting and killing for
some god-damn savior

306
00:18:04,126 --> 00:18:07,038
who as soon as he's got in power
gets to steal his own treasure?

307
00:18:07,206 --> 00:18:09,276
I don't know who the
good guys are any more

308
00:18:10,206 --> 00:18:11,639
You know Limbani

309
00:18:12,486 --> 00:18:14,283
You know he's the best there is

310
00:18:16,286 --> 00:18:21,155
I have a contract to steal Limbani from
General Ndofa

311
00:18:21,326 --> 00:18:23,476
If I don't do it, he dies

312
00:18:23,646 --> 00:18:26,682
If I do, well, perhaps he's running
the country again

313
00:18:28,205 --> 00:18:29,320
I need you, Rafer

314
00:18:29,485 --> 00:18:30,679
The answer's still no

315
00:18:32,205 --> 00:18:36,596
Now, we don't start training in
Africa until January 15th

316
00:18:36,765 --> 00:18:38,960
So I can spare you your holiday with
your child

317
00:18:39,805 --> 00:18:42,399
There's a very big pay-cheque, tax-free

318
00:18:44,045 --> 00:18:46,434
It's really been great seeing you again,

319
00:18:47,925 --> 00:18:48,914
don't spoil it

320
00:18:50,805 --> 00:18:51,601
Alright

321
00:18:53,485 --> 00:18:54,713
Can you do me a favor?

322
00:18:54,885 --> 00:18:56,034
Alright

323
00:18:57,765 --> 00:19:00,233
Show me... clear that stuff away

324
00:19:00,845 --> 00:19:03,837
Show me how you'd get in and
out of this place

325
00:19:15,365 --> 00:19:19,358
Limbani will be here,
somewhere in that barracks

326
00:19:28,684 --> 00:19:31,073
- I've got Rafer Janders.
- Good

327
00:19:31,724 --> 00:19:33,203
You haven't got Shawn Fynn

328
00:19:34,284 --> 00:19:35,319
What do you mean?

329
00:19:35,484 --> 00:19:38,681
He's either dead by now, or he will be
the second he shows his face in London

330
00:19:38,884 --> 00:19:40,237
What happened?

331
00:19:40,404 --> 00:19:41,883
It boils down...

332
00:19:42,044 --> 00:19:44,717
He removed two of the family's
men earlier this evening

333
00:19:44,884 --> 00:19:47,921
one of whom happened to be
the nephew of the local godfather

334
00:19:48,484 --> 00:19:52,716
There's already a contract out on Fynn.
The biggest London's ever seen

335
00:19:53,364 --> 00:19:55,400
- Get it cancelled.
- Impossible

336
00:19:56,004 --> 00:19:59,440
Edward Matherson and his banks have more
power than the Mafia

337
00:19:59,964 --> 00:20:01,602
That's not even a question

338
00:20:02,164 --> 00:20:03,233
You want Limbani?

339
00:20:03,444 --> 00:20:04,797
Cancel the contract

340
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,081
What's so special about him?

341
00:20:07,244 --> 00:20:10,919
This afternoon, he was a courier
for a 25 year old hoodlum

342
00:20:11,324 --> 00:20:15,112
If you'd ever seen him operate, you'd
know what was so special about him

343
00:20:15,284 --> 00:20:17,400
Also he can fly any plane
you'd care to name

344
00:20:17,564 --> 00:20:19,519
and he's my friend.
I don't have too many left

345
00:20:20,123 --> 00:20:23,035
He's no. 3 on this deal
or there's no deal

346
00:20:23,243 --> 00:20:27,031
It would be a real moral crisis
for kindly Sir Edward

347
00:20:27,323 --> 00:20:28,961
He would have to have
me and Rafer killed

348
00:20:29,163 --> 00:20:30,562
Don't you think?

349
00:20:30,763 --> 00:20:33,152
You get the details of
Shawn's last year over

350
00:20:33,323 --> 00:20:35,757
to my unspeakable hotel
as soon as you can

351
00:20:35,923 --> 00:20:37,038
Rafer and I are going after him

352
00:20:37,243 --> 00:20:40,474
Now wait a minute, this isn't your
territory. You stay out

353
00:20:40,643 --> 00:20:42,554
You're not even meant to be in
this country, remember?

354
00:20:43,163 --> 00:20:45,199
Ask for a doggy bag after
you've paid the bill

355
00:20:45,363 --> 00:20:47,160
I'll be waiting for you in my room

356
00:20:55,643 --> 00:20:56,439
Number 23a

357
00:20:56,643 --> 00:20:57,792
There it is

358
00:20:59,963 --> 00:21:01,032
Keep driving, keep driving!

359
00:21:04,643 --> 00:21:06,474
- How many is that?
- Five

360
00:21:06,643 --> 00:21:09,237
With a welcoming committee in each one.
Boy, what efficiency

361
00:21:09,403 --> 00:21:11,473
- How many are left?
- Four

362
00:21:11,643 --> 00:21:12,712
Good old Shawn!

363
00:21:12,883 --> 00:21:15,794
Living with nine women in the same
year... possibly at the same time

364
00:21:15,962 --> 00:21:19,716
Quite a feat but not beyond him...
Heather Courtney...

365
00:21:19,882 --> 00:21:21,873
Baronet Club, Denby Road

366
00:21:22,362 --> 00:21:25,911
No home address, probably sleeps on the
craps tables. We can but try

367
00:21:30,962 --> 00:21:32,520
You buy the chips here, Charlie

368
00:21:33,002 --> 00:21:34,037
OK

369
00:21:34,202 --> 00:21:35,191
In two stacks

370
00:21:39,042 --> 00:21:41,033
Thank you very much

371
00:21:47,682 --> 00:21:50,799
I'm going to get me some chips, and I'm
going to break the bank

372
00:21:50,962 --> 00:21:52,190
- Heather?
- Black 20

373
00:21:52,362 --> 00:21:54,398
Heather's at the first
Blackjack table over there

374
00:21:54,562 --> 00:21:57,634
Oh yes, I can see her now.
How comes you're wearing her breasts?

375
00:21:57,802 --> 00:22:00,270
- What did you say? - I said
she's got Heather's chest!

376
00:22:03,122 --> 00:22:05,477
Hey brother!
How you doing is this table hot?

377
00:22:06,362 --> 00:22:07,715
How are you?

378
00:22:11,522 --> 00:22:13,989
Now you just tell me how much
you got there in genuine money?

379
00:22:14,161 --> 00:22:15,674
What's the limit?

380
00:22:16,401 --> 00:22:18,869
- Twenty.
- Then give us some, Heather, baby!

381
00:22:19,081 --> 00:22:20,963
If you don't behave you'll have to leave

382
00:22:21,471 --> 00:22:23,100
<i>OOOOOOOOH!</i>

383
00:22:23,561 --> 00:22:25,438
How do you know my name?

384
00:22:25,641 --> 00:22:27,040
How do we know your name, little Heather?

385
00:22:27,201 --> 00:22:29,351
Don't stop, keep dealing and
listen very carefully

386
00:22:29,561 --> 00:22:31,392
We need your help

387
00:22:32,121 --> 00:22:33,600
Where's Shawn Fynn?

388
00:22:34,321 --> 00:22:36,551
Who? I don't know any Shawn Fynn

389
00:22:36,721 --> 00:22:37,870
Yes, you do

390
00:22:38,361 --> 00:22:39,714
Hey, I got a genuine Blackjack!

391
00:22:39,881 --> 00:22:41,997
I got a genuine Blackjack,
hotter than a fox!

392
00:22:42,201 --> 00:22:44,840
He's in great trouble,
if you know where he is, tell us

393
00:22:45,001 --> 00:22:47,959
The Mafia have a contract out on him, if
they get him before us, they'll kill him

394
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:50,829
We're down to the last minute

395
00:22:51,401 --> 00:22:52,390
We are his close friends

396
00:22:52,601 --> 00:22:56,150
Check with him and tell him that Rafer
Janders and Allen Faulkner are here

397
00:22:56,321 --> 00:23:00,030
Describe us, and be sure,
and do it now or he's a dead man

398
00:23:02,361 --> 00:23:05,637
OK, I believe you.
He's right here in this building

399
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:07,598
Behind the men's loo, there's a stairway

400
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:10,479
Top floor, first room on the left

401
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,279
Shawn, it's Allen

402
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:33,156
Not even a hearty hand-shake
or a "Shawn, my boy

403
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,952
how are you?"
- Clown

404
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,754
"Clown"? At least that's a start

405
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,797
Do you mind telling me
what you're doing here, thank God?

406
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:43,078
If we live, I'll tell you why. Idiot

407
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,999
Clown and idiot... you always were a
flatterer

408
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,743
You never change, do you Shawn?

409
00:23:47,744 --> 00:23:50,109
A whole army out there and
you're still making jokes

410
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,714
- Let's get out of here.
- Now you're making jokes. Where to?

411
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,676
Don't worry

412
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,596
Allen, open up

413
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,118
A car just pulled up at the back door

414
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,155
- Rafer, what are you doing here?
- Cycling a bike!

415
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,792
- Maniac.
- Everybody's calling me names

416
00:24:08,879 --> 00:24:12,110
Another car in front.
We'd better do a little praying

417
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:15,828
- Somebody's trying to lift this
contract. - What contract?

418
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:20,149
- Who? Would somebody tell me what's
going on? - Rafer, what you carrying?

419
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:23,477
This... and this

420
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:25,271
Sort of balances me up

421
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:51,517
Mr. Martin, I do appreciate you coming at
such short notice

422
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:55,592
It's 4 o'clock in the morning, I should
imagine you would

423
00:24:55,759 --> 00:24:58,956
And I want to get home to bed
and go to sleep

424
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:00,711
What do you want?

425
00:25:00,879 --> 00:25:03,631
I want you to lift
the contract on Shawn Fynn

426
00:25:04,198 --> 00:25:05,677
He killed my brother's son

427
00:25:06,078 --> 00:25:08,672
From what I've learned, your brother's
better off without that son

428
00:25:08,878 --> 00:25:12,188
You tell him that. He's grieving

429
00:25:12,398 --> 00:25:14,354
He'll get over it.
Let's get down to facts

430
00:25:14,558 --> 00:25:18,471
Now, I control a number of newspapers

431
00:25:18,638 --> 00:25:22,233
I guarantee you, the day
after Shawn Fynn dies,

432
00:25:22,398 --> 00:25:25,947
you and your family will be
amongst the most written-about

433
00:25:26,158 --> 00:25:27,955
and photographed men in England

434
00:25:41,558 --> 00:25:42,354
Wrong room

435
00:25:55,638 --> 00:25:56,593
Frankie!

436
00:25:59,117 --> 00:26:00,755
Get out, the contract's lifted

437
00:26:01,517 --> 00:26:02,506
I'll be damned!

438
00:26:08,997 --> 00:26:10,749
These gents should've waited 3 minutes

439
00:26:10,957 --> 00:26:12,868
Let's get out of here,
before the police arrive

440
00:26:13,037 --> 00:26:14,311
You're right

441
00:26:22,437 --> 00:26:25,713
- Very gentle, the circles you move in.
- Heather, I'm sorry

442
00:26:27,117 --> 00:26:29,153
She's the one who
told them the wrong room

443
00:26:29,357 --> 00:26:31,712
Get a doctor

444
00:26:31,917 --> 00:26:33,635
You know nothing, right?

445
00:26:33,797 --> 00:26:35,515
I will pay you back, I swear

446
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:36,792
You run along, love

447
00:26:36,957 --> 00:26:41,155
It was a pleasure helping you out, if I
still have my teeth

448
00:26:41,557 --> 00:26:43,513
Thanks. Well thank her, you clowns

449
00:26:44,237 --> 00:26:47,149
- Thanks, you're a good girl.
- Kiss her and come on

450
00:26:54,717 --> 00:26:56,513
Isn't he a love?

451
00:27:02,276 --> 00:27:05,712
I don't wish to appear rude, Thomas,
but exactly who the devil is he?

452
00:27:05,876 --> 00:27:07,832
Let's just say he's a military adviser

453
00:27:07,996 --> 00:27:08,951
Where's he from?

454
00:27:09,116 --> 00:27:12,631
A government dept. who has as much
interest in Limbani as we...

455
00:27:12,796 --> 00:27:15,026
- Which dept.?
- And that is all you get to know

456
00:27:15,196 --> 00:27:17,426
Now he's going to say "yea"
or "nay" to your plan

457
00:27:17,596 --> 00:27:20,394
His decision is final, so you
might as well start your briefing

458
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:23,389
There's no need to be hostile,
Colonel Faulkner

459
00:27:23,556 --> 00:27:24,955
We'd very much like this to succeed

460
00:27:25,356 --> 00:27:26,914
So do we Rafer...

461
00:27:27,796 --> 00:27:29,707
Alright, from the top... we use 50 men

462
00:27:29,876 --> 00:27:32,549
4 officers, 4 NCO's, 40 enlisted men,
1 medic

463
00:27:32,716 --> 00:27:35,355
and one sergeant major who'll be in
charge of training and discipline

464
00:27:35,556 --> 00:27:36,955
Who's the fourth officer?

465
00:27:37,516 --> 00:27:40,314
- Mr. Fynn has someone in mind
Pieter... - Coetzee

466
00:27:40,516 --> 00:27:42,188
He's a South African

467
00:27:42,356 --> 00:27:45,348
He served on border security
and knows the bush as good as anyone

468
00:27:46,076 --> 00:27:47,145
He'll be good, I can guarantee it

469
00:27:47,356 --> 00:27:49,267
And we're interviewing him
when you proceed to sign

470
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:51,275
We'll recruit in London,

471
00:27:51,476 --> 00:27:54,194
group and train in Swaziland.
I assume you can arrange that

472
00:27:55,515 --> 00:27:57,267
We fly from Swaziland here

473
00:27:57,435 --> 00:28:00,825
and we drop from a Hercules cargo 'plane
that's on a scheduled flight to Rwanda

474
00:28:01,035 --> 00:28:02,354
You're going to parachute in?

475
00:28:03,875 --> 00:28:06,264
No, we will be free-falling
from 25,000 feet

476
00:28:06,875 --> 00:28:07,990
You'll be using oxygen?

477
00:28:08,195 --> 00:28:09,423
Could you allow him to pause?

478
00:28:10,955 --> 00:28:11,751
Thanks, Allen

479
00:28:12,275 --> 00:28:13,352
Oxygen, no

480
00:28:13,353 --> 00:28:15,506
The cabin will be pressurized and then
de-pressurized 3 minutes before the jump

481
00:28:16,835 --> 00:28:20,191
Parachutes open at 1,500ft. They
won't hear the plane or see us land

482
00:28:20,355 --> 00:28:22,869
The plane will continue, re-fuel, come back,
pick us up

483
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:26,027
We'll be on the ground
for exactly 3 hours

484
00:28:27,235 --> 00:28:28,748
You're doing beautifully, continue

485
00:28:31,275 --> 00:28:35,951
There's a plateau, here, 7 miles from
Zembala, here

486
00:28:36,155 --> 00:28:39,306
We drop and split into two groups.
The first group,

487
00:28:39,515 --> 00:28:41,312
led by Allen, will take the barracks,

488
00:28:41,515 --> 00:28:44,427
which will be 4 miles from the drop zone
here. The second group,

489
00:28:44,635 --> 00:28:45,863
led by Shawn,

490
00:28:46,075 --> 00:28:48,713
will take the airport here,
which is 3 miles from the barracks

491
00:28:48,874 --> 00:28:52,230
The first group will take Limbani out
and go to the airport

492
00:28:52,394 --> 00:28:54,231
With proper timing, the plane should

493
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:56,069
land 10-15 minutes
later, and pick us up

494
00:28:57,314 --> 00:28:58,986
And your plan of the barracks?

495
00:29:02,434 --> 00:29:06,712
These barracks were designed to hold 200
men, if my information is correct

496
00:29:06,914 --> 00:29:08,393
It is, I corroborate

497
00:29:08,554 --> 00:29:12,342
25 of you are going to take Limbani
out from 200 men, how?

498
00:29:12,874 --> 00:29:15,672
While they're asleep.
We'll dispose of the guards,

499
00:29:15,874 --> 00:29:17,227
here... here... here

500
00:29:17,394 --> 00:29:20,113
Cut the wires, enter here, proceed
to the barracks here, here and here

501
00:29:20,314 --> 00:29:24,023
With gas masks + cyanide gas canisters,
they really won't know what hit them

502
00:29:24,794 --> 00:29:27,308
My God, you mean to say that
you intend to kill them all

503
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:28,748
Can you think of a better way?

504
00:29:29,874 --> 00:29:31,193
The UN will go mad

505
00:29:31,594 --> 00:29:33,471
Not if we get Limbani out

506
00:29:33,634 --> 00:29:35,257
General Ndofa won't say a word,

507
00:29:35,258 --> 00:29:37,149
otherwise he'll have too
much explaining to do

508
00:29:37,354 --> 00:29:40,869
to his own people.
You see he's told them that Limbani is dead

509
00:29:41,074 --> 00:29:43,383
And our objective is to get Limbani out

510
00:29:43,594 --> 00:29:44,947
Quite right

511
00:29:46,713 --> 00:29:47,987
Your plan is approved, gentlemen

512
00:29:49,793 --> 00:29:51,272
- Well done, Rafer
- Thank you

513
00:29:53,713 --> 00:29:56,946
Oh, there's one small change.
We received some updated info this morning

514
00:29:56,947 --> 00:29:59,455
The operation's been moved
forward 3 weeks

515
00:30:01,673 --> 00:30:03,231
I assume you can handle that

516
00:30:06,233 --> 00:30:07,791
Excellent. Goodbye gentlemen

517
00:30:10,833 --> 00:30:13,142
If his back was any straighter his spine
would snap

518
00:30:15,433 --> 00:30:17,344
Here's the signed contract

519
00:30:17,513 --> 00:30:18,662
Read it

520
00:30:20,353 --> 00:30:24,665
"Open-ended check-in account on a Swiss
bank. All expenses for weapons,

521
00:30:24,873 --> 00:30:26,591
and equipment etc. to be itemized

522
00:30:27,513 --> 00:30:30,983
One third of all wages
to be paid in advance

523
00:30:31,153 --> 00:30:32,552
Fair enough

524
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:36,631
£100,000 for you?

525
00:30:37,393 --> 00:30:39,190
£50,000 for Janders

526
00:30:39,353 --> 00:30:41,150
£30,000 for each of the other officers

527
00:30:41,553 --> 00:30:44,430
20,000 for NCO's and the RSM

528
00:30:44,632 --> 00:30:47,146
£10,000 for the enlisted men

529
00:30:47,632 --> 00:30:50,100
And one half of all amounts
if the mission fails

530
00:30:50,272 --> 00:30:51,671
That's absolutely outrageous!

531
00:30:51,832 --> 00:30:53,550
My sentiments exactly

532
00:30:53,712 --> 00:30:56,101
Sign here

533
00:30:59,992 --> 00:31:00,981
And here

534
00:31:03,112 --> 00:31:06,229
Here's your copy.
You can go and scream in the corridor

535
00:31:06,392 --> 00:31:07,950
Shawn, would you be good enough
to show Mr. Balfour out?

536
00:31:08,472 --> 00:31:09,382
Yes of course

537
00:31:19,472 --> 00:31:21,747
- I had no idea.
- I know

538
00:31:22,272 --> 00:31:23,546
There'll be other holidays

539
00:31:28,192 --> 00:31:31,309
Allen, I'd like your approval
on this equipment request

540
00:31:34,792 --> 00:31:38,023
Excuse me, would you know
of someone called Sandy Young?

541
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:41,430
Colonel Faulkner, sir!

542
00:31:42,991 --> 00:31:43,946
How are you, Sandy?

543
00:31:44,471 --> 00:31:45,824
Couldn't be better, sir! Yourself?

544
00:31:46,031 --> 00:31:47,066
Not bad

545
00:31:47,271 --> 00:31:49,944
I can't say what a pleasure
it is to see you sir

546
00:31:50,391 --> 00:31:52,586
It brings back memories
I never thought I'd hidden

547
00:31:52,791 --> 00:31:54,702
Let me invite you in, sir

548
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:56,748
- Is your wife at home?
- Yes, she'll be delighted

549
00:31:56,951 --> 00:32:00,102
I don't think so.
I think we'd better talk out here

550
00:32:01,031 --> 00:32:03,022
How's your retirement?

551
00:32:03,751 --> 00:32:04,979
It has its points, sir

552
00:32:05,151 --> 00:32:06,300
Such as?

553
00:32:08,031 --> 00:32:12,070
The fucking rose bushes are whipping
into shape sir, and that's about it

554
00:32:13,191 --> 00:32:14,226
How do you fancy

555
00:32:14,431 --> 00:32:16,865
whipping 50 men into shape for me?
- You're serious?

556
00:32:17,071 --> 00:32:21,030
I need a sergeant-major
and you're the best

557
00:32:22,271 --> 00:32:24,660
- I'm not too old?
- What do you think?

558
00:32:24,831 --> 00:32:26,901
Sir, where do I report and when?

559
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,988
- Tea's ready
- Look who's here, love

560
00:32:29,191 --> 00:32:30,306
Good afternoon

561
00:32:30,511 --> 00:32:31,910
Yes, I see

562
00:32:32,551 --> 00:32:34,382
I hoped I'd never see him again

563
00:32:34,551 --> 00:32:36,347
That's no way to treat an
old friend, Marjorie

564
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:37,625
He's not my friend

565
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:39,623
Tea's on the table

566
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:41,826
You're not welcome here, Mr. Faulkner

567
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:44,265
My apologies, sir

568
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:45,819
I understand

569
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:48,259
She'll be crying now, won't she?

570
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:52,629
A good deal of it, but
she'll get over it. She's a lovely girl

571
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:54,388
Yes, she is

572
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:57,020
Well, you go in...

573
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:59,940
and call me at this number tonight

574
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,669
- Sandy.
- Sir

575
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:09,299
Excuse me

576
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:12,704
Can I get you another one?

577
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:17,224
- Shawn...
- Shawn Fynn

578
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:18,339
How's it going, Pieter?

579
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:21,701
That's a good question
if you have a few hours

580
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:24,065
- What are you doing round here?
- Looking for you

581
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:25,026
Yes sir?

582
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:26,859
2 of these please

583
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:28,949
How did you find me?

584
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:30,589
Your landlady

585
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:35,186
By the way, she asked me to tell you
should pack and get out by the morning

586
00:33:35,349 --> 00:33:37,909
Rent? That's a joke

587
00:33:38,709 --> 00:33:41,781
I haven't even got the money
to buy you one back

588
00:33:43,189 --> 00:33:45,578
Why would you be looking for me?

589
00:33:46,309 --> 00:33:49,506
I might have a job for you

590
00:33:49,669 --> 00:33:51,660
Thanks, I've been in jail once,
I didn't like it

591
00:33:52,189 --> 00:33:54,020
Thank you

592
00:33:55,109 --> 00:33:58,181
I now have to prove to you that crime is
only a hobby of mine

593
00:33:58,349 --> 00:34:01,022
- It's not that kind of job.
- No?

594
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:05,941
All I want out of life right now
is to get back to South Africa

595
00:34:06,109 --> 00:34:08,179
I don't know why I came here
in the first place

596
00:34:08,389 --> 00:34:10,823
One more week and I'll explode

597
00:34:12,869 --> 00:34:15,542
It's funny you should
talk about explosives

598
00:34:15,709 --> 00:34:18,348
Because explosives could very
well be a part of this job

599
00:34:18,989 --> 00:34:19,785
What does that mean?

600
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:21,987
It's also in Africa

601
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:24,987
You must be joking

602
00:34:25,589 --> 00:34:26,385
You're serious?

603
00:34:27,349 --> 00:34:30,579
£30,000 how's that for serious

604
00:34:33,788 --> 00:34:35,506
- Right, Tosh.
- Sir

605
00:34:37,908 --> 00:34:38,704
Come in

606
00:34:43,108 --> 00:34:47,738
State clearly your name, age, previous
military experience and rank

607
00:34:48,148 --> 00:34:51,345
Donaldson, sir. Born 1932.
12 years with the paras,

608
00:34:51,508 --> 00:34:53,578
3 tours with you. Rank of Sergeant, sir

609
00:34:54,828 --> 00:34:57,820
- How have the years treated you?
- Not so good, sir

610
00:34:57,988 --> 00:34:59,899
I'm a plumber now, it's not my line

611
00:35:00,068 --> 00:35:01,183
- Married?
- Yes sir

612
00:35:01,388 --> 00:35:04,858
- Your wife know you're here?
- No sir, she'd do her nut

613
00:35:05,028 --> 00:35:07,701
If I'm accepted, sir,
I'll leave her a note

614
00:35:09,668 --> 00:35:11,226
Sir, you won't regret it

615
00:35:11,748 --> 00:35:13,784
I'm as good a man as I was at 20, sir

616
00:35:14,988 --> 00:35:15,977
Why do you want to come with us?

617
00:35:17,588 --> 00:35:19,783
It's what I do best, sir

618
00:35:19,948 --> 00:35:21,097
I love it

619
00:35:22,868 --> 00:35:25,176
Blake, Jesse, Colonel Faulkner, sir

620
00:35:25,347 --> 00:35:28,862
Age: within the acceptable range.
Experience: you name it, I've had it

621
00:35:29,347 --> 00:35:30,939
Financial status: wipe-out

622
00:35:31,147 --> 00:35:32,546
Cannot afford a haircut, sir

623
00:35:32,747 --> 00:35:34,624
Jesse, I'm glad you got my wire

624
00:35:34,787 --> 00:35:36,106
So am I, sir... it was my breakfast

625
00:35:37,347 --> 00:35:39,463
How do you feel about working in Africa?

626
00:35:39,464 --> 00:35:41,579
- I don't care where it
is, sir, except Switzerland

627
00:35:41,747 --> 00:35:45,663
Neatness scares the shit out of me.
And since I see Mr. Janders sitting there

628
00:35:45,664 --> 00:35:48,696
I know we're not going up against
any sweet and kindly group

629
00:35:48,867 --> 00:35:49,663
Thank you

630
00:35:49,867 --> 00:35:52,939
So I'm ready, available and hungry

631
00:35:53,107 --> 00:35:53,903
You're hired

632
00:35:54,787 --> 00:35:59,067
Colonel, you've made my day. Would it be
possible for you to advance me £20?

633
00:35:59,189 --> 00:36:00,582
The man has hunger

634
00:36:00,987 --> 00:36:03,262
I have this lady barber who
charges by the inch, sir

635
00:36:07,187 --> 00:36:09,303
McTaggart, aged 42, sir

636
00:36:09,507 --> 00:36:11,657
12 years in the Black Watch,
rank of Sergeant

637
00:36:11,867 --> 00:36:15,542
Undefeated regimental middleweight
champion 6 years running, sir

638
00:36:15,707 --> 00:36:16,696
What year were you born?

639
00:36:17,627 --> 00:36:19,538
193...

640
00:36:19,747 --> 00:36:21,385
Come on now, Jock.
You can do better than that

641
00:36:22,266 --> 00:36:24,461
- Yes, sir.
- How old are you?

642
00:36:24,626 --> 00:36:26,503
- 47, sir.
- You look like you could do

643
00:36:26,706 --> 00:36:27,980
with some exercise

644
00:36:28,146 --> 00:36:31,297
It will take 4 weeks to get down
to fighting weight

645
00:36:31,466 --> 00:36:33,900
- You've been hit a few times?
- Yes sir

646
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:35,863
A lot of the hitters are
still hearing bells sir

647
00:36:37,346 --> 00:36:38,335
I just like to fight,

648
00:36:38,866 --> 00:36:40,504
with weapons or without

649
00:36:40,746 --> 00:36:43,977
Witty, Arthur. Age: 43. Medical Orderly

650
00:36:44,146 --> 00:36:46,376
You don't need to go over your
qualifications. How are you?

651
00:36:46,546 --> 00:36:47,615
Good, sir

652
00:36:47,786 --> 00:36:50,095
- You look fit.
- Thank you sir

653
00:36:50,266 --> 00:36:52,985
I spend my time cranking
up hospital beds

654
00:36:53,146 --> 00:36:55,706
Patients lying around the wards,
that sort of thing

655
00:36:55,866 --> 00:36:57,584
Keeps me fit

656
00:36:57,746 --> 00:36:58,576
Why do you want to come with us?

657
00:36:59,386 --> 00:37:00,660
Colonel Faulkner,

658
00:37:00,826 --> 00:37:04,262
two years of sorting gall-stones at St
Vincent's hospital

659
00:37:04,426 --> 00:37:07,657
have hardened my heart.
And softened more important parts

660
00:37:07,866 --> 00:37:09,982
I want to reverse the process

661
00:37:10,146 --> 00:37:10,942
It could be a bloody one

662
00:37:11,346 --> 00:37:13,655
Aren't they all. I like to keep fit

663
00:37:14,546 --> 00:37:16,059
Alright, you've got the job

664
00:37:16,266 --> 00:37:17,255
Thank you, sir

665
00:37:18,186 --> 00:37:20,221
Do I have time to get a divorce?

666
00:37:20,425 --> 00:37:21,301
36 hours

667
00:37:21,505 --> 00:37:23,018
Thank you, sir

668
00:37:23,865 --> 00:37:25,776
I can't wait to see his face!

669
00:37:47,065 --> 00:37:48,623
Well-played, Emile

670
00:37:52,505 --> 00:37:56,259
- You played a good game?
- I didn't know you were coming!

671
00:37:56,425 --> 00:37:58,620
It's a surprise. What's the score?

672
00:37:58,785 --> 00:38:01,345
We're winning 4-0.
It's just a knockabout at half-time

673
00:38:07,065 --> 00:38:08,100
But why?

674
00:38:08,265 --> 00:38:09,334
It just has to be

675
00:38:09,505 --> 00:38:12,975
It's Christmas, we were going to have
3 more weeks together

676
00:38:13,185 --> 00:38:16,335
I know what I said, but sometimes these
things just can't be helped

677
00:38:16,624 --> 00:38:18,455
Anyway, you'll be with the Headmaster's
family. It'll be nice

678
00:38:18,664 --> 00:38:20,382
No it won't, I want to be with you

679
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:23,334
- I want to be with you too.
- Then don't go

680
00:38:23,544 --> 00:38:25,216
Please. It's only business

681
00:38:25,424 --> 00:38:26,493
I have to go

682
00:38:26,664 --> 00:38:30,418
I don't even know where,
what it's about, or anything

683
00:38:30,584 --> 00:38:33,576
One day I'll tell you. That's a promise

684
00:38:33,744 --> 00:38:36,417
Let's sit down for a bit, have some fun

685
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:38,053
Look

686
00:38:39,464 --> 00:38:41,614
I raided Hamley's

687
00:38:41,784 --> 00:38:44,173
It's called "Xmas whenever you want"

688
00:38:44,344 --> 00:38:46,380
Don't really want them now

689
00:38:47,904 --> 00:38:49,303
I understand

690
00:38:49,504 --> 00:38:52,735
I'll give them to the headmaster.
He'll give them to you for Christmas

691
00:38:52,904 --> 00:38:55,623
My mother was here last week with some
Frenchman

692
00:38:55,784 --> 00:38:57,376
One of the older boys said
she looked like a whore

693
00:38:58,624 --> 00:39:00,774
I didn't know what that was
so I laughed

694
00:39:00,944 --> 00:39:02,900
And then someone told me

695
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,220
Listen

696
00:39:05,944 --> 00:39:07,502
You listen to me now

697
00:39:08,144 --> 00:39:12,216
Don't pay any attention to what they
say. 'Cos you know and I know

698
00:39:12,383 --> 00:39:14,851
she's the kindest and finest
woman there is

699
00:39:15,023 --> 00:39:16,695
I want you to remember that

700
00:39:20,183 --> 00:39:22,492
- I've got to get back to the game.
- I love you

701
00:39:25,223 --> 00:39:26,781
I love you too

702
00:39:53,023 --> 00:39:54,217
Company!

703
00:39:54,583 --> 00:39:56,653
Attention!

704
00:39:57,663 --> 00:39:58,937
Some of you know me already

705
00:39:59,983 --> 00:40:00,779
Those of you who don't

706
00:40:01,663 --> 00:40:03,142
are in for a great big fucking surprise

707
00:40:03,343 --> 00:40:05,698
Those of you who do

708
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:09,133
are in for an infinitely more horrible
time than they care to remember

709
00:40:09,342 --> 00:40:12,857
Any man here steps out of line and
I will kill him stone-dead

710
00:40:13,022 --> 00:40:14,933
It will not worry me in the slightest

711
00:40:15,702 --> 00:40:17,420
There are no Queen's Regulations here

712
00:40:17,982 --> 00:40:20,894
When I say "Jump!", you ask "How high?"

713
00:40:21,742 --> 00:40:23,095
Do I make myself clear?

714
00:40:24,382 --> 00:40:26,100
"I WANT TO HEAR IT
DO I MAKE MYSELF CLEAR?!"

715
00:40:27,542 --> 00:40:28,691
Good

716
00:40:28,862 --> 00:40:33,060
On the command "Right and left turn",
A and B squads turn to the right,

717
00:40:33,262 --> 00:40:35,218
C and D squads turn to the left

718
00:40:35,742 --> 00:40:39,291
SQUADS! Right and left TURN!

719
00:40:40,662 --> 00:40:44,257
Right! Let's try for our first
heart attack shall we?!

720
00:40:44,902 --> 00:40:46,893
On the command "double march"

721
00:40:47,062 --> 00:40:49,178
You will double in clockwise and anti-
clockwise directions

722
00:40:49,342 --> 00:40:52,334
within the confines of the parade ground

723
00:40:52,542 --> 00:40:54,180
20 paces at the double,

724
00:40:54,342 --> 00:40:57,698
20 paces at a sprint,
fall flat on your bellies,

725
00:40:57,862 --> 00:41:00,899
get up and do it again until
I tell you to halt

726
00:41:01,062 --> 00:41:01,972
At the double,

727
00:41:02,182 --> 00:41:04,138
double march!

728
00:41:04,542 --> 00:41:07,897
Come on, move it! Faster than that!

729
00:41:35,341 --> 00:41:36,296
Get up,

730
00:41:36,501 --> 00:41:39,140
you lazy bunch of bastards!

731
00:41:41,021 --> 00:41:43,933
Get up sir, before I kick your head in

732
00:41:44,821 --> 00:41:46,618
Move it you dozy lot!

733
00:41:56,581 --> 00:41:58,139
Come on, get up!

734
00:41:58,341 --> 00:41:59,660
Witty you screaming faggot

735
00:41:59,861 --> 00:42:01,976
Move it before I sew up your asshole!

736
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:05,657
The Lord in his infinite wisdom
would never ordain that

737
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:07,770
Captain Janders

738
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:10,215
Get up and run

739
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:12,456
or I will string you up by the balls

740
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:14,457
Do I make myself understood?

741
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:19,536
Get up!

742
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:21,216
I can't, Sir

743
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:24,619
Get on your feet, you fucking abortion!

744
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:28,097
I've tried, sir. I'm dead

745
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:35,769
Next time you move it,
get out of my sight now

746
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:40,929
Come on, move it!
Move it you fucking bastards!

747
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:45,451
If anyone tried to convince
me I was still alive,

748
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:46,769
I would hardly believe it

749
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:52,299
Me too, I'm as much of a wreck as anyone

750
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:55,656
Alright gentlemen,
let's get down to business

751
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:59,215
We have a problem to solve

752
00:42:59,379 --> 00:43:02,371
The camp sentries Look here

753
00:43:02,539 --> 00:43:03,938
Pieter

754
00:43:04,099 --> 00:43:05,088
Look at this

755
00:43:07,299 --> 00:43:10,655
There's one here, one here and one here

756
00:43:11,219 --> 00:43:13,255
And all around, open country

757
00:43:13,739 --> 00:43:15,695
We can't make any noise

758
00:43:16,139 --> 00:43:18,892
They must be killed
instantly and silently

759
00:43:19,459 --> 00:43:21,450
And there's no cover for 100 yards?

760
00:43:23,339 --> 00:43:24,658
I'd use a crossbow

761
00:43:25,259 --> 00:43:26,408
Who do you think you are, William Tell?

762
00:43:27,179 --> 00:43:29,170
The one I have in mind
will kill at 300 yards

763
00:43:29,859 --> 00:43:33,010
At 120m, the bolt goes
straight through a man

764
00:43:34,059 --> 00:43:36,732
- Where do we find such a thing?
- Somebody I know in Durban

765
00:43:36,939 --> 00:43:40,648
I use hardwood quarrels, with vials of
cyanide attached

766
00:43:40,819 --> 00:43:44,494
The quarrel will shatter inside the man,
and if that doesn't kill him instantly,

767
00:43:44,659 --> 00:43:47,457
the cyanide takes effect in less than
one second. So there is no sound

768
00:43:49,819 --> 00:43:51,411
Get the weapon,

769
00:43:51,619 --> 00:43:53,177
I'll take care of the sentries

770
00:43:54,059 --> 00:43:55,457
OK. You have it

771
00:43:55,898 --> 00:43:58,253
Anything else, sir?

772
00:43:58,858 --> 00:44:00,007
No

773
00:44:00,458 --> 00:44:01,254
Good night then

774
00:44:07,018 --> 00:44:08,133
Pieter, is something wrong?

775
00:44:12,898 --> 00:44:16,857
In South Africa, we call the blacks
"kaffir", like you call them "niggers"

776
00:44:17,018 --> 00:44:19,737
I don't particularly like them,
but I don't like killing them

777
00:44:20,378 --> 00:44:23,529
I'm sure you've hunted black
terrorists in your own country

778
00:44:24,018 --> 00:44:26,248
Those terrorists hunted me

779
00:44:26,458 --> 00:44:31,088
General Ndofa's army killed
more innocent people in one day

780
00:44:31,258 --> 00:44:33,010
Than your terrorists did in a year

781
00:44:33,178 --> 00:44:36,250
Maybe, but that is in Ndofa's
country, not in mine

782
00:44:37,418 --> 00:44:40,171
Our mission is to save
the life of Limbani

783
00:44:40,338 --> 00:44:43,296
and get him out. He's a special man

784
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:45,975
I'm no good at politics

785
00:44:46,138 --> 00:44:50,290
I don't know Limbani,
or the people that back him

786
00:44:50,458 --> 00:44:53,415
I only know that I don't like killing
people I've nothing to do with

787
00:44:53,817 --> 00:44:55,967
Then what the hell
are you doing here, Pieter?

788
00:44:56,177 --> 00:44:57,769
You know why

789
00:44:58,897 --> 00:45:00,694
This is my ticket home

790
00:45:00,857 --> 00:45:02,654
My money to buy a farm

791
00:45:02,817 --> 00:45:04,296
Nothing more

792
00:45:04,457 --> 00:45:08,052
So I'll be killing for me and
I'll live with it later

793
00:45:09,017 --> 00:45:13,488
And you'll be killing to impose your
ideas on the future of mankind on others

794
00:45:13,697 --> 00:45:15,688
whether they're right or wrong

795
00:45:16,737 --> 00:45:19,012
I wonder how we stack up
against each other morally

796
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:26,246
Is that all, sir?

797
00:45:35,537 --> 00:45:37,892
Morals amongst mercenaries...

798
00:45:38,057 --> 00:45:39,968
Who'd thought we'd ever see the day

799
00:45:40,937 --> 00:45:42,495
We'll have to keep an eye on him

800
00:45:43,457 --> 00:45:46,309
We'll have to watch him,
can't afford any risks

801
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:47,735
If he's not with us, he's dead

802
00:45:48,536 --> 00:45:50,970
I know from your records,
you're all perfect

803
00:45:51,136 --> 00:45:53,889
Don't forget to bend your knees when
you hit, to take the shock out of it

804
00:45:54,096 --> 00:45:55,131
and roll over

805
00:45:55,936 --> 00:45:58,450
Esposito, what the fuck
are you waiting for?

806
00:45:58,656 --> 00:46:00,408
A push? Go!

807
00:46:02,456 --> 00:46:03,775
Next man, move it

808
00:46:03,976 --> 00:46:06,331
You have one jump to make,
it better be perfect,

809
00:46:06,536 --> 00:46:09,096
or you get left where you fall. Go!

810
00:46:11,496 --> 00:46:12,690
Very good

811
00:46:16,016 --> 00:46:17,927
That was LUDICROUS, sir

812
00:46:18,096 --> 00:46:19,734
You're jumping from an airplane,

813
00:46:19,936 --> 00:46:23,008
not a whorehouse window. Do it again

814
00:46:23,576 --> 00:46:24,372
Sir

815
00:46:24,656 --> 00:46:28,365
Keep the rhythm up, not too quick

816
00:46:48,815 --> 00:46:50,248
Get out of the car

817
00:46:50,415 --> 00:46:52,246
I've got an urgent message for
Colonel Faulkner

818
00:46:52,815 --> 00:46:53,611
Get in

819
00:46:53,775 --> 00:46:54,764
Up!

820
00:47:07,895 --> 00:47:08,884
Come in

821
00:47:10,855 --> 00:47:12,174
Gentlemen, sit down

822
00:47:18,655 --> 00:47:19,644
We're going in tomorrow night

823
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:24,011
You're kidding

824
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:25,643
Tomorrow's Christmas

825
00:47:25,855 --> 00:47:27,129
We'll celebrate on the 26th

826
00:47:27,695 --> 00:47:30,004
How did this happen?
We were guaranteed a seven day notice

827
00:47:31,615 --> 00:47:35,051
According to this message,
a crazy old lady relative of Limbani

828
00:47:35,215 --> 00:47:37,968
had a vision that he'd risen
from the dead

829
00:47:38,135 --> 00:47:39,693
and it spread through the tribe like...
the mumps

830
00:47:40,615 --> 00:47:44,368
Made Ndofa very nervous. He wants to get
this thing over with fast

831
00:47:44,574 --> 00:47:47,407
Now Limbani's being delivered tomorrow
night. We'll be there 4 hours later

832
00:47:49,054 --> 00:47:51,727
Splendid. The best news I've had since
I threw up my lunch

833
00:47:53,014 --> 00:47:54,288
Well, be prepared to throw up dinner

834
00:47:55,374 --> 00:47:57,683
Instead of taking a small bodyguard,
Ndofa's taking the Simbas with him

835
00:47:58,454 --> 00:47:59,250
That's his own regiment

836
00:47:59,734 --> 00:48:01,645
And they're good, as we know

837
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:05,451
We won't come across them. We'll have
Limbani out before they get close

838
00:48:06,454 --> 00:48:08,012
If all goes well

839
00:48:08,414 --> 00:48:10,166
Alright gentlemen, now to business

840
00:48:10,374 --> 00:48:12,808
Rafer, see that the men make their wills

841
00:48:13,014 --> 00:48:14,493
Shawn, take the men into town

842
00:48:15,094 --> 00:48:17,892
They can kiss their money goodbye
if they're not back by 0400

843
00:48:18,094 --> 00:48:19,686
Drunk, laid and parleyed

844
00:48:19,894 --> 00:48:22,010
They deserve it. That's all

845
00:48:29,894 --> 00:48:30,883
Sandy

846
00:48:32,734 --> 00:48:33,883
Sit down

847
00:48:42,093 --> 00:48:45,085
I just wanted to have this private
moment with you, old friend,

848
00:48:46,533 --> 00:48:48,888
to thank you.
You're the best of the best

849
00:48:49,693 --> 00:48:51,888
You've earned your money five times over

850
00:48:52,373 --> 00:48:55,410
I appreciate that sir,
but I'm not quite sure what it means

851
00:48:55,613 --> 00:48:58,207
It means that I'd like you and your wife
to spend your money in good health

852
00:48:59,653 --> 00:49:01,052
You trying to tell me
I'm not coming along?

853
00:49:01,773 --> 00:49:02,649
Yes

854
00:49:03,893 --> 00:49:06,532
Sir, with respect, you can stick your money

855
00:49:06,733 --> 00:49:08,689
up your ass

856
00:49:08,853 --> 00:49:10,411
- Sandy!
- I love what I do

857
00:49:10,613 --> 00:49:14,925
And believe it or not, I also love those
grubby thick-headed men I trained

858
00:49:15,093 --> 00:49:16,242
you most of all

859
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:18,284
I expect to be with them

860
00:49:18,493 --> 00:49:20,768
and with you. Because I'm needed

861
00:49:20,933 --> 00:49:25,131
And if you want to see a REAL
revolution, try and stop me

862
00:49:32,813 --> 00:49:34,041
You're the best!

863
00:49:34,213 --> 00:49:37,139
Who are you leaving
your money to, Queenie?

864
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,603
Well, if it's any of your business,

865
00:49:38,772 --> 00:49:43,323
To the dearest, kindest proctologist
in the whole wide world

866
00:49:43,492 --> 00:49:44,288
What's that?

867
00:49:45,652 --> 00:49:49,042
"Bum-doctor" to you, chubby cheeks

868
00:50:01,452 --> 00:50:02,441
Come along auntie!

869
00:50:02,652 --> 00:50:04,802
We'll find you a lovely bit of tail

870
00:50:05,332 --> 00:50:06,401
No thanks dear

871
00:50:06,612 --> 00:50:08,250
You enjoy yourselves

872
00:50:08,412 --> 00:50:11,370
I'll be waiting up for you,
with bandages and penicillin

873
00:50:11,572 --> 00:50:13,449
Have your bums ready!

874
00:50:30,532 --> 00:50:33,603
I never think about dying
I've got my death all planned

875
00:50:33,771 --> 00:50:37,127
Blind drunk, lying on the pavement, roll
off, fracture my skull... out

876
00:50:37,291 --> 00:50:38,167
I think about it

877
00:50:38,891 --> 00:50:41,280
- That has no purpose.
- Your children are grown-up

878
00:50:41,451 --> 00:50:42,406
That's true

879
00:50:43,411 --> 00:50:45,288
Allen, I want you to do something for me

880
00:50:45,491 --> 00:50:48,528
If I buy it,
I'd like you to see that my son's alright

881
00:50:49,011 --> 00:50:49,807
Me?

882
00:50:49,971 --> 00:50:53,930
- I mean you put me into this pit.
- Don't you have any decent friends?

883
00:50:54,731 --> 00:50:56,244
Well, I've just made you his Godfather

884
00:50:57,211 --> 00:50:59,190
Look, if his mother doesn't
take care of him,

885
00:50:59,191 --> 00:51:01,170
I'd like you to take him away from her

886
00:51:02,931 --> 00:51:04,922
That's absolutely crazy

887
00:51:05,091 --> 00:51:07,002
You must have an IQ of 2

888
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:10,689
When I'm not employed killing perfect
strangers, I'm an out-of-work drunk

889
00:51:11,691 --> 00:51:13,886
Bit of responsibility would do you good

890
00:51:14,971 --> 00:51:16,609
I want your hand on it

891
00:51:19,091 --> 00:51:20,240
You're not going to die, Rafer

892
00:51:20,411 --> 00:51:21,969
I know it, you know it,

893
00:51:22,571 --> 00:51:24,129
but it's the guy up there who decides

894
00:51:24,971 --> 00:51:26,563
Well, I'll ask him

895
00:51:40,410 --> 00:51:42,287
Come on, move it

896
00:51:54,930 --> 00:51:57,728
Come on, move it up, right down

897
00:52:03,210 --> 00:52:05,246
What's the hold-up? Come on

898
00:52:05,890 --> 00:52:06,766
All in, sir

899
00:53:54,968 --> 00:53:56,003
Service is a bit slow

900
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:28,003
For President Limbani

901
00:54:28,167 --> 00:54:30,556
Yes, sir. He'll need these

902
00:54:37,167 --> 00:54:40,000
We've got 3 minutes left. We're
de-pressurizing now Red light on

903
00:54:40,167 --> 00:54:42,158
Alright. Get them on their feet,
Sergeant-Major

904
00:54:42,327 --> 00:54:43,203
On your feet!

905
00:54:46,007 --> 00:54:48,726
I suppose a transfer to the cavalry is
out of the question, sergeant-major?

906
00:54:49,647 --> 00:54:51,638
- Check equipment.
- CHECK YOUR EQUIPMENT!

907
00:55:03,527 --> 00:55:06,121
- Stations.
- Get in position for the jump

908
00:55:44,446 --> 00:55:45,242
Jump!

909
00:57:29,004 --> 00:57:30,073
Shawn, how goes it?

910
00:57:30,244 --> 00:57:33,600
Oh fine, fine thanks. I tell you, Jock,
that's it

911
00:57:33,764 --> 00:57:36,198
My heels are where my balls used to be

912
00:59:06,282 --> 00:59:07,681
I don't believe it!

913
00:59:07,842 --> 00:59:09,639
2 out of 3 asleep Pieter?

914
00:59:10,522 --> 00:59:13,878
Take the one who's asleep first.
You have 3 minutes for the other 2

915
00:59:14,962 --> 00:59:16,236
Rafer?

916
00:59:16,442 --> 00:59:18,239
Get inside the fence there. Stay there

917
00:59:18,442 --> 00:59:20,797
When we've passed, bring your men

918
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:02,869
Cut it

919
01:03:20,758 --> 01:03:21,554
Hello

920
01:03:22,198 --> 01:03:23,995
Stay right where you are. Don't move

921
01:03:24,198 --> 01:03:25,597
Not a sound

922
01:03:26,158 --> 01:03:27,989
We'd like your keys

923
01:03:29,198 --> 01:03:31,871
Whoever has them, just hand them over

924
01:03:32,718 --> 01:03:35,232
Esposito, start with him first

925
01:03:42,278 --> 01:03:43,074
Try the Cuban

926
01:04:00,117 --> 01:04:01,516
I'll go round the other side

927
01:04:36,914 --> 01:04:39,667
Mr. Limbani, I'm Faulkner. Just lie there

928
01:04:39,834 --> 01:04:41,391
Come on Pieter, quickly

929
01:04:48,033 --> 01:04:49,068
Witty?

930
01:04:50,393 --> 01:04:52,190
- Everybody OK?
- Yes

931
01:04:53,113 --> 01:04:54,512
Keith, find Captain Janders

932
01:04:54,673 --> 01:04:57,028
- Tell him to send Lt Fynn to take the
airport. - Sir!

933
01:04:59,593 --> 01:05:00,582
Alright?

934
01:05:01,193 --> 01:05:01,989
Yes, sir

935
01:05:03,393 --> 01:05:05,702
I've got some lovely pills from London
for your heart

936
01:05:06,513 --> 01:05:08,151
You just relax now

937
01:05:08,713 --> 01:05:09,702
Here

938
01:05:10,793 --> 01:05:12,784
Drink a bit of this, come on

939
01:05:13,513 --> 01:05:16,266
- That's good.
- How is he?

940
01:05:19,593 --> 01:05:21,265
I live, Mr. Faulkner

941
01:05:21,473 --> 01:05:23,031
That's the plan, sir

942
01:05:24,953 --> 01:05:26,352
Pieter, you're responsible for him

943
01:05:26,553 --> 01:05:27,747
From now on, he never leaves your sight

944
01:05:28,953 --> 01:05:29,783
Alright, let's go

945
01:05:30,073 --> 01:05:31,108
Esposito!

946
01:05:31,433 --> 01:05:33,742
<i>Well then, kaffir On your feet</i>

947
01:05:35,953 --> 01:05:37,352
Here we go, love

948
01:05:37,912 --> 01:05:39,140
That's fine

949
01:05:39,312 --> 01:05:40,108
Up

950
01:05:40,872 --> 01:05:41,782
Come on

951
01:05:46,752 --> 01:05:47,741
The keys

952
01:05:48,312 --> 01:05:49,301
Here you are

953
01:05:52,952 --> 01:05:54,101
Shawn...

954
01:05:55,192 --> 01:05:56,989
<i>- Come in, Shawn.
- I receive you</i>

955
01:05:57,152 --> 01:05:58,983
We have it. Go ahead

956
01:05:59,472 --> 01:06:00,666
Good luck

957
01:06:47,071 --> 01:06:50,507
ZEMBALA AIRPORT

958
01:08:55,669 --> 01:08:56,943
He's all yours, Jock

959
01:08:57,149 --> 01:08:57,945
Come on!

960
01:09:19,509 --> 01:09:21,465
Excellent... excellent

961
01:09:29,148 --> 01:09:32,140
This is Rushton Put Charlie 1 into
effect immediately

962
01:09:32,748 --> 01:09:35,740
That's right, immediately. What's so
surprising about that?

963
01:09:36,588 --> 01:09:40,058
Well, route it through any embassy
you need. That's your job, do it

964
01:09:45,348 --> 01:09:46,906
It'll be difficult, but we'll make it

965
01:09:56,948 --> 01:09:57,903
Get Mr. Limbani out first

966
01:09:58,108 --> 01:09:59,905
and be careful with him

967
01:10:00,108 --> 01:10:01,939
Take him to the foot of
the control tower

968
01:10:04,028 --> 01:10:04,938
Well done, Sandy

969
01:10:05,108 --> 01:10:06,621
Allen, let's go and see Shawn

970
01:10:07,388 --> 01:10:10,539
Mister Limbani, the 'plane
should be here any minute

971
01:10:13,788 --> 01:10:18,623
Alright, let's move out to the runway.
Follow me at the double, come on

972
01:10:21,467 --> 01:10:23,617
Put him down there

973
01:10:24,987 --> 01:10:27,262
Iron Man, Iron Man.
Wild Goose, Wild Goose

974
01:10:27,427 --> 01:10:29,338
Well done, Shawn.
Are they on their way in?

975
01:10:29,507 --> 01:10:33,102
The radio's Russian,
the dials work backwards

976
01:10:33,267 --> 01:10:36,145
Iron Man, Iron Man Wild Goose,
Wild Goose. Do you read, over?

977
01:10:37,467 --> 01:10:40,220
"Iron Man", "Wild Goose"... sounds like
a finger up a tin man's backside,

978
01:10:40,427 --> 01:10:41,542
doesn't it?

979
01:10:42,027 --> 01:10:44,587
<i>Wild Goose, this is Iron Man.
I receive you</i>

980
01:10:44,747 --> 01:10:48,899
God bless us, each and every one. Iron
Man, get yourself in here. We're waiting

981
01:10:49,067 --> 01:10:51,740
- Well Allen, we're just 12 minutes behind
schedule. - Make you feel good?

982
01:10:52,147 --> 01:10:54,536
If Limbani's heart holds out,
I'll feel bloody marvelous

983
01:10:58,667 --> 01:11:00,225
We've heard the plane sir

984
01:11:01,507 --> 01:11:03,816
Iron Man, we hear your engines

985
01:11:12,707 --> 01:11:15,062
Sounds like you're South-East of us

986
01:11:18,626 --> 01:11:20,856
I have you in sight.
We're commencing descent

987
01:11:21,026 --> 01:11:21,822
There it is!

988
01:11:31,866 --> 01:11:33,697
No, no. Don't move

989
01:11:50,826 --> 01:11:51,895
Right on the money

990
01:11:56,106 --> 01:11:57,744
Let's hope we've got a couple of
stewardesses on board

991
01:11:58,106 --> 01:11:59,175
We need three

992
01:12:00,346 --> 01:12:01,938
£30,000

993
01:12:08,906 --> 01:12:09,702
Let's go and meet them

994
01:12:09,866 --> 01:12:12,585
<i>Iron Man, this is Charlie 1</i>

995
01:12:12,786 --> 01:12:14,423
<i>The message is: pass them by</i>

996
01:12:15,345 --> 01:12:16,619
<i>I repeat, Iron Man</i>

997
01:12:16,825 --> 01:12:18,543
Pass them by

998
01:12:18,745 --> 01:12:20,940
Christ, those poor bastards

999
01:12:22,025 --> 01:12:24,095
Charlie 1, message received, Wilco

1000
01:12:28,385 --> 01:12:31,223
Iron Man, Iron Man,
what's going on, over?

1001
01:12:33,785 --> 01:12:34,581
Get him up

1002
01:12:45,425 --> 01:12:46,540
Get yourselves back here

1003
01:12:52,945 --> 01:12:55,300
<i>Sorry, orders. Good luck to you</i>

1004
01:12:55,465 --> 01:12:56,580
Orders?

1005
01:12:57,345 --> 01:12:59,336
Orders? We're stuffed...
who's Charlie 1, Allen?

1006
01:13:10,985 --> 01:13:12,702
I'm going to speak to the men

1007
01:13:16,824 --> 01:13:17,620
Men,

1008
01:13:17,824 --> 01:13:19,337
we have been double-crossed

1009
01:13:20,264 --> 01:13:22,698
But we will plan a way out of here

1010
01:13:28,664 --> 01:13:29,983
- Jock
- Sir?

1011
01:13:30,144 --> 01:13:31,862
We need more trucks, find them

1012
01:13:32,024 --> 01:13:34,584
I want everybody loaded on
and ready to roll, now

1013
01:13:34,744 --> 01:13:37,304
- And find all the spare ammunition and
weapons you can. - Sir

1014
01:13:46,424 --> 01:13:48,654
I thought we had this in the bag

1015
01:13:50,184 --> 01:13:51,299
There's a man called Matherson

1016
01:13:51,504 --> 01:13:53,335
who has a lot to answer for

1017
01:13:53,864 --> 01:13:54,853
Sir Edward Matherson?

1018
01:13:55,344 --> 01:13:57,016
- Yes.
- He's Charlie 1?

1019
01:13:57,184 --> 01:13:59,414
Yes, Sir Edward Matherson.
He's the money

1020
01:14:00,544 --> 01:14:02,023
What's happened then?

1021
01:14:02,224 --> 01:14:04,818
I'm guessing he's made a new deal with
Ndofa. He doesn't need Limbani any more

1022
01:14:04,984 --> 01:14:07,861
He could've done that yesterday
and aborted the mission then?

1023
01:14:08,023 --> 01:14:11,413
This way he saves $500,000,
the rest of our money

1024
01:14:12,023 --> 01:14:14,378
I'd like to meet him one day

1025
01:14:14,543 --> 01:14:16,579
Rafer, my friend, one day we will

1026
01:14:17,663 --> 01:14:19,654
Alright Rafer, how do we
get out of here?

1027
01:14:20,463 --> 01:14:21,657
And where do we go, Allen?

1028
01:14:22,423 --> 01:14:24,078
Within hours, we'll have the whole of

1029
01:14:24,079 --> 01:14:25,733
Ndofa's army down on
us like a ton of bricks

1030
01:14:25,903 --> 01:14:27,222
You'd prefer to surrender?

1031
01:14:27,423 --> 01:14:29,220
I'd rather have Witty
treat my hemorrhoids

1032
01:14:30,423 --> 01:14:33,733
Rafer, you have 10 minutes.
You're the planner

1033
01:14:34,463 --> 01:14:37,614
Allen, I've got something to say to you

1034
01:14:38,103 --> 01:14:42,699
I'll give it to you emotionally first,
then rationally

1035
01:14:42,863 --> 01:14:45,502
- This man, Matherson?
- Yes

1036
01:14:45,663 --> 01:14:47,176
He's given us the royal
screwing of all time

1037
01:14:47,343 --> 01:14:49,538
Now my first instinct is to give
it back to him, and worse

1038
01:14:49,703 --> 01:14:52,854
- Me too, but that's for another time.
- Ah!

1039
01:14:53,023 --> 01:14:55,332
We came to get Limbani, we've got him,
so we use him

1040
01:14:55,503 --> 01:14:58,017
Show him to his tribe, they'll
think he's been re-incarnated

1041
01:14:58,183 --> 01:14:59,719
They're about ready for a civil war

1042
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:01,255
Let's start it, maybe
we could even win it

1043
01:15:01,463 --> 01:15:04,102
Stop, right there.
Now you listen to me, Rafer

1044
01:15:04,263 --> 01:15:06,361
I've got 50 good men down there

1045
01:15:06,362 --> 01:15:08,460
and their lives are my
responsibility. I'm not going on

1046
01:15:08,662 --> 01:15:10,857
a bloody crusade. I don't want to debate
with you Rafer, at least not now

1047
01:15:11,022 --> 01:15:12,899
So just get on with it and
get us out of here!

1048
01:15:13,262 --> 01:15:16,732
OK. Now I'll give it to you rationally

1049
01:15:17,462 --> 01:15:19,737
- The North is out of the question.
- Why?

1050
01:15:19,942 --> 01:15:21,933
What if we got hold of a
ferry to Burundi?

1051
01:15:22,102 --> 01:15:23,501
I wouldn't cross that
lake even on a destroyer,

1052
01:15:23,502 --> 01:15:24,900
Ndofa's men will pick us off like ducks

1053
01:15:25,342 --> 01:15:27,333
They wouldn't let us into Burundi
anyway, nor Rwanda

1054
01:15:27,502 --> 01:15:29,094
Zambia's too far

1055
01:15:29,262 --> 01:15:32,857
East? 600 miles of jungle, totally
impassable

1056
01:15:33,662 --> 01:15:35,095
That still leaves the South

1057
01:15:35,902 --> 01:15:37,813
Exactly, the South

1058
01:15:37,982 --> 01:15:40,655
Limbani country. I know it well

1059
01:15:40,822 --> 01:15:42,938
There's a dry river and
an old stone bridge

1060
01:15:43,102 --> 01:15:45,093
If we cross that bridge,
we're on our way to Kalima

1061
01:15:45,262 --> 01:15:46,297
What's in Kalima?

1062
01:15:46,462 --> 01:15:49,260
Limbani was born there. We can walk it

1063
01:15:49,462 --> 01:15:51,357
- Rafer...
- For God's sakes it's our only

1064
01:15:51,358 --> 01:15:53,455
way of accomplishing something
from this whole fucking mess!

1065
01:15:54,302 --> 01:15:57,499
50 men in the valley of the shadow, and
he wants to take over an entire country!

1066
01:15:57,702 --> 01:15:59,818
There's no bloody place to run to!

1067
01:15:59,982 --> 01:16:01,858
So why not stand and fight?

1068
01:16:02,021 --> 01:16:03,852
And for the cause. For two causes

1069
01:16:04,021 --> 01:16:06,660
One: Limbani. He's the best there is,
words from your own lips

1070
01:16:06,861 --> 01:16:07,816
And two...

1071
01:16:09,621 --> 01:16:10,576
Matherson

1072
01:16:12,781 --> 01:16:16,535
You know Rafer, sometimes it's
almost a pleasure knowing you

1073
01:16:18,381 --> 01:16:19,177
Alright, let's do it

1074
01:16:21,061 --> 01:16:22,130
Let's do it?

1075
01:16:23,501 --> 01:16:25,378
I'm in the hands of maniacs

1076
01:16:25,861 --> 01:16:28,011
Have a good trip. Goodbye

1077
01:16:34,101 --> 01:16:35,090
Good

1078
01:16:36,021 --> 01:16:37,659
Call me back when you get confirmation

1079
01:16:38,541 --> 01:16:41,578
Well, here's to General Ndofa

1080
01:16:41,741 --> 01:16:45,256
Difficult bastards to negotiate with,
but it's a good deal

1081
01:16:45,421 --> 01:16:46,570
Cheers

1082
01:16:47,421 --> 01:16:50,174
- Let's hope Ndofa continues to
honor it. - Oh he will

1083
01:16:50,341 --> 01:16:52,897
He's got brand new finances,
and we've got the mines

1084
01:16:52,898 --> 01:16:54,175
We're back in the copper business

1085
01:17:29,300 --> 01:17:32,690
- They don't build bridges like this now.
- It would go off with a hell of a bang

1086
01:17:32,860 --> 01:17:34,691
- We haven't got any stuff.
- Pity

1087
01:17:34,860 --> 01:17:36,851
We haven't got time anyway. Let's go

1088
01:17:44,780 --> 01:17:45,576
Go

1089
01:18:10,379 --> 01:18:11,573
Come on, man

1090
01:18:11,739 --> 01:18:12,888
It won't start

1091
01:18:13,739 --> 01:18:15,138
Well keep trying

1092
01:18:17,179 --> 01:18:18,009
What's happened?

1093
01:18:30,739 --> 01:18:31,694
Got a problem?

1094
01:18:40,539 --> 01:18:41,688
- Rafer! Take cover!
- Tosh!

1095
01:18:48,339 --> 01:18:49,738
Back the Jeep up

1096
01:18:51,018 --> 01:18:51,848
Take cover!

1097
01:19:03,898 --> 01:19:05,047
Quick, get out of there

1098
01:19:06,258 --> 01:19:07,577
Jock, get the men across the bridge

1099
01:19:11,018 --> 01:19:12,167
Take cover!

1100
01:19:18,818 --> 01:19:19,614
Take cover!

1101
01:19:19,818 --> 01:19:21,331
Come on, get out!

1102
01:20:17,737 --> 01:20:18,533
Jesus

1103
01:20:19,497 --> 01:20:21,249
Not even Jesus could get through that

1104
01:20:27,977 --> 01:20:29,092
You alright, sir?

1105
01:20:38,537 --> 01:20:41,335
They'll be back with more planes
before we can get through that fire

1106
01:20:41,537 --> 01:20:43,209
Well get moving

1107
01:20:43,497 --> 01:20:45,134
Decoy them away from us

1108
01:20:45,296 --> 01:20:49,335
We'll cross with Limbani lower down.
Meet you at Kalima village

1109
01:20:49,896 --> 01:20:51,852
Alright. Come on men, move out

1110
01:21:04,656 --> 01:21:06,692
- A write-off?
- A complete write-off

1111
01:21:07,376 --> 01:21:09,606
West, Smith and Robertson, sir

1112
01:21:11,936 --> 01:21:13,335
Look after Mr. Limbani

1113
01:21:24,656 --> 01:21:26,089
Can't leave them for the Simbas

1114
01:21:27,136 --> 01:21:29,809
No, we can't. You volunteering?

1115
01:21:37,656 --> 01:21:38,884
Suppose I'll do it

1116
01:22:17,975 --> 01:22:20,933
We'll keep going for about another hour

1117
01:22:21,095 --> 01:22:23,245
Then we'll hole up somewhere for a while

1118
01:22:23,655 --> 01:22:25,452
How many men have we got left, Sandy?

1119
01:22:25,615 --> 01:22:29,403
Counting the colonel's group,
32 including 6 walking wounded, sir

1120
01:22:30,455 --> 01:22:32,525
That's a hell of a formidable unit

1121
01:22:33,935 --> 01:22:35,334
I wouldn't like to be up against us, sir

1122
01:22:52,574 --> 01:22:53,973
Let's rest here

1123
01:22:58,934 --> 01:23:02,404
That's what's good for him sir,
if we want to keep him alive

1124
01:23:02,574 --> 01:23:04,132
What happened?

1125
01:23:04,654 --> 01:23:05,530
We're going to carry him

1126
01:23:05,734 --> 01:23:08,009
We'll carry on until noon,
then we'll rest

1127
01:23:08,174 --> 01:23:09,243
I'll take him

1128
01:23:20,094 --> 01:23:21,812
You alright? I'll take point

1129
01:23:21,974 --> 01:23:24,124
- Let me carry him.
- No way

1130
01:23:24,294 --> 01:23:25,727
Just hang on, kaffir

1131
01:23:30,454 --> 01:23:34,083
My blood is red, just like yours. Don't
call me kaffir

1132
01:23:34,253 --> 01:23:35,971
Take that hand off my face,

1133
01:23:36,573 --> 01:23:37,528
kaffir

1134
01:23:38,213 --> 01:23:41,046
- Where do you come from? Rhodesia?
- South Africa

1135
01:23:41,213 --> 01:23:45,001
South Africa?
I knew Jan Smuts a long time

1136
01:23:45,173 --> 01:23:46,731
He was a good man

1137
01:23:46,893 --> 01:23:49,726
I don't get to meet prime ministers

1138
01:23:49,893 --> 01:23:51,212
now shut up!

1139
01:23:51,373 --> 01:23:52,931
Whatever you say

1140
01:24:27,773 --> 01:24:28,808
What do you want?

1141
01:24:29,413 --> 01:24:30,607
Just talk

1142
01:24:30,773 --> 01:24:34,287
Talk? You're a politician for sure

1143
01:24:34,452 --> 01:24:38,161
I've not had anyone to
talk to for two years

1144
01:24:38,932 --> 01:24:40,923
Just prison guards

1145
01:24:41,092 --> 01:24:44,562
I entertained myself trying
to provoke them to kill me

1146
01:24:44,732 --> 01:24:46,484
No point trying with me

1147
01:24:47,492 --> 01:24:49,722
Go to sleep man!

1148
01:24:50,572 --> 01:24:51,971
"Man"?...

1149
01:24:52,852 --> 01:24:55,082
That's an improvement over kaffir

1150
01:24:58,532 --> 01:25:02,650
- What did you do in South Africa?
- I fought black cops

1151
01:25:02,812 --> 01:25:04,928
Who were you fighting against, cops?

1152
01:25:06,092 --> 01:25:08,526
If you're asking me if I understand the

1153
01:25:08,527 --> 01:25:10,961
politics of my country,
the answer's "no"

1154
01:25:12,132 --> 01:25:16,250
At least we have an equal opportunity to
neglect our education

1155
01:25:17,012 --> 01:25:18,286
What do blacks do there?

1156
01:25:20,692 --> 01:25:22,489
They want to take over my home

1157
01:25:23,492 --> 01:25:25,369
That's all saving your life means to me

1158
01:25:25,532 --> 01:25:28,523
A chance to live my own life,
a free man in the country I love

1159
01:25:29,251 --> 01:25:31,048
That's good enough

1160
01:25:32,411 --> 01:25:34,879
Only one thing to remember about Africa

1161
01:25:35,931 --> 01:25:40,561
Today, freedom is only a word
for a new oppressor

1162
01:25:41,011 --> 01:25:44,765
Black or White, North or South,

1163
01:25:44,931 --> 01:25:48,241
if you want to live here,
you've got to think about tomorrow

1164
01:26:01,851 --> 01:26:03,728
- That's Kalima
- Picturesque

1165
01:26:04,691 --> 01:26:07,000
- Sandy? - Sir? - Post guards,
send a patrol into the village

1166
01:26:07,411 --> 01:26:08,480
- Tosh, come on.
- Sir

1167
01:26:24,330 --> 01:26:25,729
This will do for now

1168
01:26:29,210 --> 01:26:31,121
If your white friends in South Africa

1169
01:26:31,330 --> 01:26:32,126
could see you now...

1170
01:26:32,290 --> 01:26:33,484
Oh, kaffir,

1171
01:26:33,650 --> 01:26:38,246
if you think you can ride me through the
bush like a mule and laugh at me,

1172
01:26:38,410 --> 01:26:40,321
you can bloody well crawl

1173
01:26:43,530 --> 01:26:47,887
We've carried you people on our backs
ever since we came to this country

1174
01:26:48,050 --> 01:26:50,041
It's the other way round I believe

1175
01:26:50,210 --> 01:26:54,044
Is it? You need me to save your
miserable black life right now

1176
01:26:54,210 --> 01:26:57,407
I do. And you need me to save yours

1177
01:26:57,850 --> 01:26:59,249
We need each other, white man

1178
01:26:59,730 --> 01:27:03,200
and that's the way it should be.
We've got the whole world using us,

1179
01:27:03,410 --> 01:27:06,607
setting group against group,
destroying Africa

1180
01:27:07,490 --> 01:27:10,448
For me, "freedom" is just a another
label for the upgrade of slavery

1181
01:27:11,010 --> 01:27:14,480
and the final bloodbath is coming,
between blacks and whites,

1182
01:27:14,690 --> 01:27:16,226
and then between black and black

1183
01:27:16,227 --> 01:27:17,762
when you whites have left
Africa without support

1184
01:27:18,410 --> 01:27:20,605
Man, we have built your countries

1185
01:27:20,769 --> 01:27:23,442
and now you are kicking us out
of almost all of them

1186
01:27:23,609 --> 01:27:26,282
You're living on foreign aid,
robbing your own people blind

1187
01:27:26,449 --> 01:27:28,548
You're crying about outside oppression

1188
01:27:28,549 --> 01:27:30,647
while killing each other
in great big batches

1189
01:27:31,889 --> 01:27:33,527
Now once you have
something better to offer

1190
01:27:33,729 --> 01:27:35,685
You come and see us
in the white South Africa

1191
01:27:36,369 --> 01:27:38,644
We both have something better to offer

1192
01:27:39,289 --> 01:27:42,645
Listen to me. Because the white
south will be next unless they learn

1193
01:27:42,849 --> 01:27:47,081
You're joking. The whites were born
here, we're just as African as you are

1194
01:27:47,249 --> 01:27:49,922
And don't make any mistake.
We're going to stay

1195
01:27:50,129 --> 01:27:51,926
I'm glad to hear that

1196
01:27:52,089 --> 01:27:54,284
You need to join us for a better future

1197
01:27:54,489 --> 01:27:55,683
Join you?

1198
01:27:56,489 --> 01:27:58,798
We've got to learn to care
for each other

1199
01:27:58,969 --> 01:28:02,245
or they'll be nothing left of our Africa
except battlefields

1200
01:28:04,809 --> 01:28:07,801
You have a point there.
But do you have an answer?

1201
01:28:08,769 --> 01:28:10,680
I have the will to look for one

1202
01:28:11,569 --> 01:28:15,357
We must forgive you for the past and you
must forgive us for the present

1203
01:28:15,929 --> 01:28:20,001
If we have no future together,
then we have no future

1204
01:28:20,168 --> 01:28:23,956
That's what I believe in,
and that's what I'm going to die for

1205
01:28:26,488 --> 01:28:28,683
You're beginning to sound good to me

1206
01:28:29,248 --> 01:28:33,036
Maybe we need you,
maybe you are just the man

1207
01:28:35,408 --> 01:28:36,204
Alright

1208
01:28:36,408 --> 01:28:37,284
Let's get moving

1209
01:28:37,448 --> 01:28:41,600
Maybe I'm a bloody fool,
but I'm going to take you there

1210
01:28:41,808 --> 01:28:43,161
Let's see if you are lying

1211
01:28:46,688 --> 01:28:48,838
Just hang on tight, bloke

1212
01:29:19,007 --> 01:29:20,884
Heavenly Father, what's going on?

1213
01:29:21,047 --> 01:29:22,639
What's going on?

1214
01:29:23,007 --> 01:29:24,486
Get out of my village

1215
01:29:24,687 --> 01:29:25,676
You heathens!

1216
01:29:25,887 --> 01:29:28,162
You Godless heathens!
Why did you come to my church?

1217
01:29:28,367 --> 01:29:31,120
I've got women and children,
waiting to be slaughtered

1218
01:29:32,287 --> 01:29:34,005
Tosh, why those shots?

1219
01:29:34,687 --> 01:29:36,917
It was nothing, sir. It was just a pig

1220
01:29:37,847 --> 01:29:40,725
Father Geoghagen... good God...

1221
01:29:40,887 --> 01:29:43,196
I thought you were dead... long ago

1222
01:29:43,367 --> 01:29:45,323
Looking at you and your guns... I am

1223
01:29:45,527 --> 01:29:47,165
We need your help

1224
01:29:47,327 --> 01:29:48,396
To kill your brothers?

1225
01:29:48,607 --> 01:29:50,040
I hope not

1226
01:29:53,167 --> 01:29:55,727
Always the same,
but I'm glad to see you

1227
01:29:55,927 --> 01:29:58,646
I hate the sight of you.
I want you out of my village

1228
01:30:00,967 --> 01:30:03,117
Let's talk about it over there

1229
01:31:20,605 --> 01:31:22,596
Come on, let's go

1230
01:31:35,685 --> 01:31:37,801
- Witty, over here.
- Get your lovely ass out of here

1231
01:31:38,885 --> 01:31:40,841
Witty's holding the fort!

1232
01:31:44,245 --> 01:31:45,564
Stay down!

1233
01:31:45,765 --> 01:31:48,757
Come on, my pretties. Show yourselves

1234
01:32:01,878 --> 01:32:03,339
Witty!

1235
01:32:05,299 --> 01:32:07,199
Pieter... come here

1236
01:32:15,244 --> 01:32:17,997
Come on my dears! Where are you?

1237
01:32:33,164 --> 01:32:35,758
Well look at you, you big bastards

1238
01:32:37,484 --> 01:32:39,918
What a shame we can't be friends

1239
01:33:31,563 --> 01:33:33,952
- Leave him to me.
- You're welcome

1240
01:34:21,842 --> 01:34:24,231
Don't worry. We'll make it

1241
01:34:25,122 --> 01:34:25,952
Come on, Colonel Faulkner

1242
01:35:34,161 --> 01:35:36,038
Leave me you will go faster

1243
01:35:37,401 --> 01:35:39,153
<i>Oh no, kaffir</i>

1244
01:35:41,081 --> 01:35:42,753
<i>I have to bring you back</i>

1245
01:35:48,921 --> 01:35:50,070
<i>Don't die</i>

1246
01:35:51,160 --> 01:35:53,355
<i>Please don't die</i>

1247
01:35:59,280 --> 01:36:00,076
Let's go

1248
01:36:25,400 --> 01:36:26,310
Spread out

1249
01:36:29,880 --> 01:36:30,869
Mr. Limbani

1250
01:36:33,640 --> 01:36:34,550
Please

1251
01:36:36,360 --> 01:36:38,749
You can leave him now Mr. President.
He's dead

1252
01:37:50,198 --> 01:37:53,986
- How do you feel?
- As you would say, Mr. Faulkner,

1253
01:37:54,958 --> 01:37:56,516
I'm just hanging on

1254
01:37:56,838 --> 01:37:58,908
Tell me if I'm wrong

1255
01:37:59,078 --> 01:38:01,433
You want my people to rise up and fight

1256
01:38:01,638 --> 01:38:04,710
I'd like your country to be yours, sir

1257
01:38:04,918 --> 01:38:09,514
- Yes, so would I. But I think spears
against machine guns was not a plan

1258
01:38:10,398 --> 01:38:12,866
If you started it, there'd be
something to back us up

1259
01:38:13,038 --> 01:38:14,517
It's happened before

1260
01:38:14,678 --> 01:38:16,236
Copper can be powerfully persuasive

1261
01:38:24,478 --> 01:38:26,548
I've been through all of it with him,

1262
01:38:26,718 --> 01:38:29,391
and God knows we've got enough
commitment but we have no chance

1263
01:38:29,558 --> 01:38:30,468
I've heard all that before

1264
01:38:30,638 --> 01:38:32,708
I'll tell you now, the Simbas have got
a whole battalion out there

1265
01:38:33,398 --> 01:38:34,990
About an hour ago,
there's more following

1266
01:38:35,198 --> 01:38:36,472
What the devil are we doing here then?

1267
01:38:36,638 --> 01:38:39,471
Possibly saving a good man
for a better day

1268
01:38:39,678 --> 01:38:41,747
With 30 men? What are we meant
to do, walk out of Africa?

1269
01:38:41,957 --> 01:38:42,992
We could probably try running

1270
01:38:43,157 --> 01:38:46,706
Allen, believe me, these people have got
nothing to fight for

1271
01:38:48,077 --> 01:38:49,635
There's nowhere to run

1272
01:38:57,757 --> 01:39:01,909
God in heaven, it's true. I didn't truly
believe the rumor

1273
01:39:02,117 --> 01:39:04,347
We're a little pressed for time, Father

1274
01:39:04,517 --> 01:39:06,109
- You're Faulkner.
- That's right

1275
01:39:06,277 --> 01:39:08,233
Don't call me "Father",
you murdering pig

1276
01:39:08,437 --> 01:39:11,270
I have no time to discuss my
finer qualities with you now

1277
01:39:11,437 --> 01:39:13,428
Get those elders to have a look at him

1278
01:39:27,637 --> 01:39:29,355
I'd like to talk to my people

1279
01:39:29,557 --> 01:39:30,876
alone

1280
01:39:37,956 --> 01:39:40,390
I believe you want to start
a civil war here, Faulkner

1281
01:39:40,796 --> 01:39:43,109
You'd be responsible for slaughter
and starvation the likes of which

1282
01:39:43,110 --> 01:39:44,266
you've never seen

1283
01:39:45,076 --> 01:39:48,227
You'll be up to your eyes in blood...

1284
01:39:48,436 --> 01:39:51,109
and you'll die, Faulkner. And all of us

1285
01:39:51,276 --> 01:39:54,268
I'm against you. And God's against you

1286
01:39:54,436 --> 01:39:57,633
And if you'll excuse the blasphemy,
we're both tough sons of bitches

1287
01:39:57,836 --> 01:40:00,111
That sort of talk could get
back to the Vatican, Father

1288
01:40:00,276 --> 01:40:01,152
You shut your mouth!

1289
01:40:01,356 --> 01:40:03,153
I will turn these people against you,

1290
01:40:03,316 --> 01:40:05,830
in spite of Limbani,
I curse you from every hill

1291
01:40:06,036 --> 01:40:09,073
Alright, that's enough!
The decision's being made in there

1292
01:40:09,236 --> 01:40:10,032
Alright

1293
01:40:10,436 --> 01:40:12,586
I offer you a bargain, Faulkner

1294
01:40:12,756 --> 01:40:15,316
About 3 miles from here,
through the bush

1295
01:40:15,476 --> 01:40:18,036
There's a mine airstrip,
with an old Dakota

1296
01:40:18,236 --> 01:40:19,954
just sitting on the side

1297
01:40:21,396 --> 01:40:22,465
You said what?

1298
01:40:22,876 --> 01:40:26,755
A Dakota. It's alright,
I've flown in it

1299
01:40:26,916 --> 01:40:29,714
And there's nothing between it and us,
but a deserted village

1300
01:40:29,916 --> 01:40:31,474
I'll lead you there myself

1301
01:40:32,596 --> 01:40:35,155
You've still got time to take Limbani
and leave us in peace

1302
01:40:41,955 --> 01:40:43,627
Well, Mr. President

1303
01:40:43,795 --> 01:40:46,787
They say if they fight now, they'll die,

1304
01:40:46,955 --> 01:40:48,104
and they know it

1305
01:40:48,835 --> 01:40:50,154
They were willing,

1306
01:40:51,075 --> 01:40:53,225
but I can't do that, Mr. Faulkner

1307
01:40:53,395 --> 01:40:55,989
I can't, do you understand?

1308
01:40:56,875 --> 01:40:59,105
I told them to bear their
spears and wait

1309
01:40:59,635 --> 01:41:01,546
and be ready for Limbani's return

1310
01:41:01,995 --> 01:41:03,826
They agreed

1311
01:41:04,035 --> 01:41:05,673
- Without understanding why.
- Alright

1312
01:41:05,875 --> 01:41:08,025
You rest here.
We're going to get you out

1313
01:41:10,515 --> 01:41:11,834
- We've got Limbani.
- Praise God

1314
01:41:11,995 --> 01:41:14,384
Praise Limbani. Now show us
where that airplane is

1315
01:41:14,555 --> 01:41:17,149
Shawn, take 4 men, check it out
and let me know

1316
01:41:17,315 --> 01:41:18,668
- We'll be following.
- Alright Allen

1317
01:41:20,395 --> 01:41:21,669
Sandy, get the men out and ready to move

1318
01:41:21,875 --> 01:41:22,751
We can't take the dead

1319
01:41:22,915 --> 01:41:26,032
Sir! Right, come on, at the double

1320
01:41:30,355 --> 01:41:31,867
You made the right decision, Allen

1321
01:41:32,034 --> 01:41:33,228
Limbani made it, I didn't

1322
01:41:33,394 --> 01:41:34,565
If he can't save his country from here,

1323
01:41:34,566 --> 01:41:36,909
the question is, what'll we do
with him once we get him out?

1324
01:41:37,074 --> 01:41:40,225
We knows? We may be back
again to do another contract

1325
01:41:40,394 --> 01:41:41,429
You never quit, do you?

1326
01:41:41,594 --> 01:41:45,030
If I did, I wouldn't have
a future would I? Also...

1327
01:41:45,194 --> 01:41:47,105
don't laugh, but, err...

1328
01:41:47,274 --> 01:41:49,834
- that man in there...
- I know, he got to you, right?

1329
01:41:50,034 --> 01:41:50,830
Yes

1330
01:42:00,714 --> 01:42:01,510
There you are, boys

1331
01:42:01,714 --> 01:42:03,193
There she is, over there

1332
01:42:12,674 --> 01:42:13,550
Good afternoon

1333
01:42:13,714 --> 01:42:15,545
- Are you going to fly this thing, or am I?
- What?

1334
01:42:56,273 --> 01:42:57,626
Keep going

1335
01:43:14,313 --> 01:43:16,031
We were lucky, Colonel

1336
01:43:16,193 --> 01:43:19,185
Yes, they could be anywhere.
We'll have to go ahead

1337
01:43:19,353 --> 01:43:22,789
Rafer, you're the rear-guard.
Take 3 men, stick close to us

1338
01:43:22,953 --> 01:43:24,863
Jesse, take point and go like hell

1339
01:43:25,032 --> 01:43:27,421
- Sandy, look after Mr. Limbani.
- Yes sir

1340
01:43:27,592 --> 01:43:30,709
- When there's no-one else about you
can call me Allen. - Yes sir

1341
01:43:34,752 --> 01:43:36,822
<i>I think we've been spotted,
don't call back and</i>

1342
01:43:37,032 --> 01:43:40,149
don't start up until we get there.
I want it quiet. Out

1343
01:43:40,552 --> 01:43:43,624
Father, I think you should get on
your ass and vacate the premises

1344
01:43:44,032 --> 01:43:45,624
You're likely to get your
sainthood shot off

1345
01:43:47,032 --> 01:43:48,431
I'll do that

1346
01:43:51,192 --> 01:43:52,671
Good luck, you Godless murderers

1347
01:43:53,712 --> 01:43:56,146
That's one of the most moving
benedictions I ever heard

1348
01:43:58,112 --> 01:43:59,431
Merry Christmas to you, Father

1349
01:44:00,152 --> 01:44:01,471
What's left of it

1350
01:44:22,791 --> 01:44:24,907
Sandy, there's your killing ground

1351
01:44:25,071 --> 01:44:28,905
Take Tosh and 4 other men and
set up a field of fire

1352
01:44:29,071 --> 01:44:31,505
Rafer & I will go deep around
& take them in the flank

1353
01:44:32,391 --> 01:44:34,825
We're losing light. I wouldn't want
to take this wreck up in the dark

1354
01:44:34,991 --> 01:44:37,505
We could try and find them, sir,
and lead them in

1355
01:44:38,191 --> 01:44:39,863
We don't know where they're coming from

1356
01:44:40,031 --> 01:44:43,068
Derek, you stay with me. Jock, take the
Vickers and set it up this end

1357
01:44:43,231 --> 01:44:45,699
Quincy, help me move this out of here

1358
01:44:45,871 --> 01:44:46,986
Come on, move

1359
01:44:54,631 --> 01:44:55,780
Set it up here

1360
01:45:42,710 --> 01:45:43,586
We're dead

1361
01:45:43,750 --> 01:45:47,459
Esposito, you're not dead until
I TELL you you're dead, understand?

1362
01:45:47,630 --> 01:45:48,426
Wait

1363
01:45:49,790 --> 01:45:50,586
Wait

1364
01:45:51,790 --> 01:45:52,825
Wait

1365
01:45:57,590 --> 01:45:58,545
Fire fire fire fire!

1366
01:46:33,149 --> 01:46:34,628
Forward!

1367
01:46:36,509 --> 01:46:38,101
Keep going!

1368
01:46:45,629 --> 01:46:46,903
Let's go!

1369
01:47:23,548 --> 01:47:25,140
Hold it! They're ours, too

1370
01:48:39,227 --> 01:48:42,378
Put Mr. Limbani on the 'plane first.
The other 4 will cover

1371
01:48:54,107 --> 01:48:56,416
We have to wait for Sandy and the group

1372
01:49:05,426 --> 01:49:08,384
Rafer, Jock, set up cover on the
edge of the airstrip, move

1373
01:49:30,066 --> 01:49:31,784
- Mr. Limbani alright, Daniel?
- Yes, he is

1374
01:49:50,426 --> 01:49:51,415
Move!

1375
01:50:25,505 --> 01:50:26,381
Come on, Allen!

1376
01:50:30,025 --> 01:50:31,344
Move your bloody ass!

1377
01:50:36,665 --> 01:50:38,018
Hurry up and get on

1378
01:50:47,185 --> 01:50:49,983
- It's moving!
- Stay down! They're getting closer

1379
01:50:54,865 --> 01:50:56,662
Hit them with the bazooka!

1380
01:51:01,224 --> 01:51:02,452
Ready!

1381
01:51:07,304 --> 01:51:08,419
Let's go!

1382
01:51:18,664 --> 01:51:21,861
Get on board, fast. Come on

1383
01:51:22,024 --> 01:51:23,218
Sandy, go!

1384
01:51:34,624 --> 01:51:37,741
Cover us halfway. When you hear
the guns, start running, we'll cover you

1385
01:51:37,904 --> 01:51:40,372
We won't wait for you,
we're running out of ammo

1386
01:51:47,588 --> 01:51:49,007
ALLEN!

1387
01:51:49,873 --> 01:51:52,681
Sandy!...
Sandy!

1388
01:51:56,503 --> 01:51:58,141
- Leave him, he's dead.
- Yes sir

1389
01:51:58,903 --> 01:51:59,779
Come on

1390
01:52:24,143 --> 01:52:26,737
Rafer! Come on! Come on!

1391
01:52:32,823 --> 01:52:34,495
Come on, Rafer!

1392
01:52:36,023 --> 01:52:37,092
Shawn, stop the plane

1393
01:52:37,303 --> 01:52:39,817
I can't, if we don't get off on the
first run, we've had it

1394
01:52:44,863 --> 01:52:45,659
Go!

1395
01:53:02,622 --> 01:53:03,816
Rafer, come on!

1396
01:53:23,182 --> 01:53:24,297
Hang on, Rafer

1397
01:53:24,502 --> 01:53:25,935
- Hold on.
- Allen!

1398
01:53:36,942 --> 01:53:39,854
Allen, shoot me!
For God's sakes, shoot me!

1399
01:53:40,062 --> 01:53:42,018
No, I can't! No!

1400
01:53:42,622 --> 01:53:43,418
Stop the plane

1401
01:53:44,942 --> 01:53:46,170
Emile!

1402
01:54:53,780 --> 01:54:54,895
Where are we heading?

1403
01:54:55,060 --> 01:54:57,620
South Rhodesia

1404
01:54:58,060 --> 01:55:00,051
That's 800 miles,
we don't have the fuel

1405
01:55:00,220 --> 01:55:03,018
We better have it,
there's no other place to go

1406
01:55:04,647 --> 01:55:08,216
Shawn... I killed Rafer

1407
01:55:10,980 --> 01:55:12,811
The Simbas would've
chopped him into small pieces

1408
01:55:14,860 --> 01:55:16,339
Allen, go and see how the men are

1409
01:55:16,500 --> 01:55:18,570
There's 13 of us left

1410
01:55:21,140 --> 01:55:23,608
Tell them to jettison everything
that's not nailed down

1411
01:55:23,820 --> 01:55:24,650
Everything! Do it

1412
01:55:25,300 --> 01:55:26,619
Mr. Limbani's getting worse, sir

1413
01:55:38,580 --> 01:55:40,376
It was a very good try, Mr. Faulkner

1414
01:55:40,579 --> 01:55:43,616
It's not over, just hang on.
Don't give up now

1415
01:55:46,859 --> 01:55:47,735
About Mr. Janders...

1416
01:55:48,539 --> 01:55:50,530
There was nothing else you could do

1417
01:56:02,859 --> 01:56:05,737
- How's Jock?
- He's dead, sir

1418
01:56:06,739 --> 01:56:10,129
Why? What was it for, sir?

1419
01:56:11,339 --> 01:56:12,488
I don't know

1420
01:56:13,659 --> 01:56:14,569
Alright

1421
01:56:15,019 --> 01:56:16,975
We have to get rid of
everything on board

1422
01:56:17,577 --> 01:56:19,693
That includes old Jock.
I'll leave it with you, Sergeant

1423
01:56:20,459 --> 01:56:21,494
Yes, sir

1424
01:56:21,859 --> 01:56:24,089
Gennaro, get his legs

1425
01:56:25,179 --> 01:56:26,532
How much fuel do we have left?

1426
01:56:26,699 --> 01:56:28,894
Bad... we're on the auxiliary tanks

1427
01:56:30,059 --> 01:56:34,098
Salisbury control,
9 Quebec November X-Ray Alpha

1428
01:56:34,659 --> 01:56:36,058
on 6603

1429
01:56:36,739 --> 01:56:38,330
Do you read? Over?

1430
01:56:38,498 --> 01:56:40,250
<i>9 Quebec November X-Ray Alpha</i>

1431
01:56:40,458 --> 01:56:43,416
<i>This is Salisbury.
State your destination, over</i>

1432
01:56:43,898 --> 01:56:48,926
Mercenary unit, departing Kalima.
7 wounded on board

1433
01:56:49,138 --> 01:56:51,015
Urgently request permission
to land, Kariba

1434
01:56:51,218 --> 01:56:53,288
If they refuse, keep on talking

1435
01:56:53,458 --> 01:56:55,892
<i>X- Ray Alpha, stand-by</i>

1436
01:57:01,978 --> 01:57:04,856
We're going to need positive proof
that you're on board

1437
01:57:05,458 --> 01:57:06,573
Write this down

1438
01:57:07,658 --> 01:57:09,137
Got a pen?

1439
01:57:12,738 --> 01:57:13,568
<i>X- ray Alpha,</i>

1440
01:57:13,778 --> 01:57:15,348
<i>this is Salisbury Control, come in</i>

1441
01:57:15,349 --> 01:57:16,133
Allen!

1442
01:57:18,538 --> 01:57:20,415
Reading you at strength 4, over

1443
01:57:20,618 --> 01:57:24,850
<i>Permission to land denied.
Do not cross our borders</i>

1444
01:57:25,018 --> 01:57:28,135
For Christ's sakes man, we have wounded
on board, we can sort it out later, over

1445
01:57:28,298 --> 01:57:30,812
<i>I repeat, do not cross our borders</i>

1446
01:57:30,978 --> 01:57:32,570
<i>Our air force has been alerted</i>

1447
01:57:32,738 --> 01:57:33,613
Give that to me

1448
01:57:34,697 --> 01:57:36,494
<i>We would be forced to shoot you down</i>

1449
01:57:36,657 --> 01:57:39,296
Salisbury... X-ray Alpha

1450
01:57:39,457 --> 01:57:43,416
Now you listen to me. Julius Limbani
is on board and he's alive

1451
01:57:43,617 --> 01:57:45,608
Note this down and pass
it to the highest authority

1452
01:57:45,817 --> 01:57:46,932
you can find

1453
01:57:47,097 --> 01:57:48,450
Allen, look at the starboard fuel gauge

1454
01:57:48,657 --> 01:57:52,650
Mr. Limbani said there was a
secret meeting in July of 1960

1455
01:57:52,817 --> 01:57:55,729
on the now Zambian-Zaire border

1456
01:57:55,730 --> 01:57:58,536
concerning federal intervention
in the Congo crisis

1457
01:57:58,737 --> 01:58:00,489
Present at the meeting
were the following:

1458
01:58:00,697 --> 01:58:01,686
Julius Limbani...

1459
01:58:14,897 --> 01:58:16,967
Brace yourselves,
we've only got one engine

1460
01:58:34,416 --> 01:58:37,055
The man is dead, Mr. Faulkner

1461
01:58:37,216 --> 01:58:39,366
Now only the spirit remains

1462
01:58:56,616 --> 01:59:00,814
<i>November X-ray Alpha, this is Salisbury.
Authorization to land at Kariba</i>

1463
01:59:00,976 --> 01:59:02,967
<i>We will turn the lights on</i>

1464
01:59:03,136 --> 01:59:06,048
<i>You'll see it just before the lake.
Good luck</i>

1465
01:59:06,216 --> 01:59:07,649
Thank you. Allen...

1466
01:59:09,056 --> 01:59:10,375
I heard

1467
01:59:11,416 --> 01:59:12,735
Limbani's dead

1468
02:00:18,255 --> 02:00:20,007
OK, thanks

1469
02:00:22,935 --> 02:00:25,050
Goodbye, bon voyage

1470
02:00:40,174 --> 02:00:42,324
Will there be anything else
this evening, sir?

1471
02:00:43,134 --> 02:00:44,533
No, thanks

1472
02:00:44,694 --> 02:00:46,093
Good night, sir

1473
02:01:13,654 --> 02:01:15,406
Yes, what is it, Andrew?

1474
02:01:15,574 --> 02:01:17,963
There will be something more tonight,
Sir Edward

1475
02:01:24,213 --> 02:01:25,771
Go ahead and make your move

1476
02:01:32,293 --> 02:01:35,285
That would be mate in two.
I'd like to see you get out of that

1477
02:01:35,493 --> 02:01:37,006
That's for another time

1478
02:01:38,293 --> 02:01:39,965
There are 6 servants in this house

1479
02:01:40,533 --> 02:01:43,411
I saw at least ten. How did you count?

1480
02:01:44,093 --> 02:01:45,321
What do you want, Faulkner?

1481
02:01:45,493 --> 02:01:47,165
You're a very bad conversationalist!

1482
02:01:47,333 --> 02:01:50,131
You'll have to excuse me,
I've had a very tiring evening

1483
02:01:50,333 --> 02:01:51,925
I heard, I was in the drawing room

1484
02:01:53,333 --> 02:01:56,689
I know you're dying to tell me.
How did you get in?

1485
02:01:57,213 --> 02:02:01,684
I did a crash course
in how to trip alarms

1486
02:02:02,533 --> 02:02:04,489
You're not very well protected

1487
02:02:04,653 --> 02:02:07,770
And I guess you're dying to know
how I got back to England?

1488
02:02:07,933 --> 02:02:09,730
Yes, indeed

1489
02:02:09,893 --> 02:02:12,646
Well, if I went into details,
we'd be here all night

1490
02:02:13,253 --> 02:02:14,572
Let's just say it wasn't easy

1491
02:02:14,733 --> 02:02:16,564
I'm sure it wasn't

1492
02:02:16,733 --> 02:02:19,724
You're a remarkable man, Faulkner

1493
02:02:19,892 --> 02:02:21,962
I have contracts to kill you world-wide

1494
02:02:22,692 --> 02:02:25,968
When I have time I'll grow a moustache
and buy a pair of dark glasses

1495
02:02:26,812 --> 02:02:27,961
In the meantime,

1496
02:02:28,172 --> 02:02:30,242
I have my own contract to carry out

1497
02:02:31,292 --> 02:02:32,850
- On me?
- That's why I'm here

1498
02:02:34,972 --> 02:02:37,008
Perhaps we can make an arrangement

1499
02:02:37,212 --> 02:02:38,565
Yes, we can

1500
02:02:38,732 --> 02:02:40,723
You owe me a great deal of money

1501
02:02:40,892 --> 02:02:43,360
Also there are 11 men still alive

1502
02:02:44,212 --> 02:02:46,168
And I haven't even counted
the women and orphans yet

1503
02:02:47,532 --> 02:02:48,885
Let's have a look at your safe

1504
02:02:49,812 --> 02:02:52,770
After you. Very slowly

1505
02:03:17,091 --> 02:03:19,844
I've turned off the alarm already.
Open it

1506
02:03:29,091 --> 02:03:30,524
All the money in the case

1507
02:03:35,131 --> 02:03:38,487
- I see you came prepared.
- Yes

1508
02:03:39,571 --> 02:03:41,163
Dollars, very good

1509
02:03:42,731 --> 02:03:45,723
Very good, thousand dollar bills

1510
02:03:46,211 --> 02:03:49,840
I wager the US treasury
wonders where they went

1511
02:03:50,331 --> 02:03:52,003
Now tell me about the arrangement

1512
02:03:52,211 --> 02:03:53,326
Now

1513
02:03:54,251 --> 02:03:57,209
500,000 dollars

1514
02:03:57,731 --> 02:03:59,881
Half of what I owe you

1515
02:04:00,051 --> 02:04:02,804
I lift all the contracts on your head

1516
02:04:02,971 --> 02:04:06,281
and pay the other half in cash,
wherever you choose

1517
02:04:06,491 --> 02:04:08,447
- And I trust you?
- Yes

1518
02:04:08,611 --> 02:04:10,328
And naturally, I don't kill you?

1519
02:04:11,450 --> 02:04:12,439
Correct

1520
02:04:17,930 --> 02:04:21,366
Do you know, I had a speech prepared

1521
02:04:21,530 --> 02:04:24,522
I'd been rehearsing it for 3 months.
It was pretty good

1522
02:04:25,130 --> 02:04:30,079
All about betrayal and lost friends.
A sort of passionate requiem

1523
02:04:30,250 --> 02:04:34,368
And naturally, what a filthy
cold-blooded monster you are

1524
02:04:36,850 --> 02:04:39,125
That part was very eloquent

1525
02:04:39,330 --> 02:04:42,447
It even went into the philosophical
implications

1526
02:04:42,610 --> 02:04:45,302
of the relationship between
a mercenary and his employer

1527
02:04:45,303 --> 02:04:46,649
You'd have been impressed

1528
02:04:47,290 --> 02:04:49,850
But right now, face to face with you

1529
02:04:50,050 --> 02:04:51,768
I don't want to go through all that

1530
02:04:52,130 --> 02:04:54,564
See, I don't mind taking money from you

1531
02:04:54,730 --> 02:04:56,846
But having you offer
me money for the lives

1532
02:04:56,847 --> 02:04:58,962
of all those bodies littering Africa

1533
02:04:59,130 --> 02:05:02,281
is actually degrading

1534
02:05:04,890 --> 02:05:08,768
So I turn down your arrangement

1535
02:05:13,689 --> 02:05:14,678
I see...

1536
02:05:15,729 --> 02:05:18,766
Well, then I suppose
you'd better kill me

1537
02:05:19,529 --> 02:05:22,089
You're a remarkable man too, Sir Edward

1538
02:05:22,729 --> 02:05:24,401
So I suppose I better had

1539
02:05:26,329 --> 02:05:27,523
Now just wait a minute!

1540
02:05:35,889 --> 02:05:36,924
Wait...

1541
02:06:04,768 --> 02:06:07,043
Can I ask how it went?

1542
02:06:07,448 --> 02:06:08,437
No

1543
02:06:09,568 --> 02:06:10,967
I thought so

1544
02:06:24,888 --> 02:06:26,685
Send the ball back, Emile

1545
02:06:31,728 --> 02:06:33,320
Let's talk about your Father
