1
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:49,758
Dear David Bowie...

2
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:59,476
Well, it's Monday morning, which,
let's face it, in Cincinnati, is redundant.

3
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:04,480
I'm getting ready for school,
or, as I like to call it,

4
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:06,941
Guantánamo with a lunch period.

5
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:09,527
My mom says
that's seeing the glass half-empty.

6
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:12,656
Personally, I just hope one day
to actually see the glass.

7
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:15,074
Will, you're going to be late.

8
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,909
Will?

9
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:20,038
Are you writing another letter
to David Bowie?

10
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,707
Doesn't it bother you
that he never writes back?

11
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:25,836
- He knows that would only intimidate me.
- See, why can't I process rejection like that?

12
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:33,177
Good. Let's go.

13
00:01:34,553 --> 00:01:37,681
So, what does the white whale
symbolize here?

14
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,018
School isn't gut-wrenchingly awful.

15
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:44,730
Mostly, it's just kind of like novocaine
for the soul.

16
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,191
I tend to make snap judgments
about people

17
00:01:49,193 --> 00:01:52,321
based on what kind of music they like.
Like these kids are into hip-hop lite,

18
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:57,075
the kind where some rapper does one verse
of a Christina Aguilera song.

19
00:01:58,035 --> 00:01:59,952
Then there's the "Trustafarians. "

20
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:03,081
Rich suburban white kids with knit caps
and $2,000 dreadlocks extensions.

21
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:08,795
The indie-rock clique is made up of me
and one other kid I refuse to meet

22
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:12,758
until he bathes
and stops flattening his hair with his hand.

23
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:15,134
What can I say?

24
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:18,263
I think I just kind of missed the memo
about how to fit in in Cincinnati.

25
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:23,894
I'm sorry. That was an accident.

26
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:25,645
- Dewey.
Dewey!

27
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:26,979
Dewey!

28
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,108
Oh, well. As a wise musician once said,

29
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:33,445
"I have become comfortably numb. "

30
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,535
Well, that's all for now.

31
00:02:41,537 --> 00:02:44,665
Your number-one fan, Will Burton.

32
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:56,509
What's the one thing I could say right now
to make this better?

33
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,303
You quit your job
and we're moving out of Cincinnati?

34
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,889
I quit my job
and we're moving out of Cincinnati.

35
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:05,018
- You're a cat and I'm just your play toy.
- No, no, I mean it, I mean it.

36
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:08,312
- Aunt Nan gave me a job.
- In Jersey?

37
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:11,148
Yeah! Yeah, and it's more money,
and flexible hours...

38
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:13,776
- Seriously?
- Yeah! And it's perfect.

39
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:16,654
The schools in Jersey
start second semester later.

40
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:19,783
Mom!

41
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:23,494
What? What is it?

42
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:26,080
I mean, it's not going
to be any different there.

43
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:29,209
Okay, there's the Will Burton
I know and love.

44
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:31,544
God, for a moment,
you were actually possessed

45
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:34,673
by a happy, well-adjusted teenager.

46
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:37,843
- It might be different. Different kids.
- Yeah, but same me.

47
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:41,805
Hey, hey. You are not the problem.
You are terrific.

48
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:47,435
Will.

49
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:50,564
Listen, honey, if you miss out on life,
they win.

50
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:59,573
- If you just put your hand in mine
- If you just put your hand in mine

51
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,328
- We're gonna leave all our troubles behind
- We're gonna leave all our troubles behind

52
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:08,664
- We'll walk and don't look back
- We'll walk and don't look back

53
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:11,167
- Don't look back
- Don't look back

54
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:13,711
Okay, Mick Jagger recorded this
with Peter Tosh.

55
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:16,631
It's almost ska.
It's like reggae, but it pops more,

56
00:04:16,632 --> 00:04:19,342
and they don't sing about Jah.

57
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:21,677
You have no idea
what I'm talking about, do you?

58
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,721
No.

59
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:26,850
But it's nice to see you so happy!

60
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:28,351
Lodi!

61
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:44,910
Will, honey, it's a big day tomorrow.
Get to bed.

62
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,262
Well?

63
00:05:04,263 --> 00:05:06,097
Elvis is entering the building.

64
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:08,724
- Unharmed?
- Completely.

65
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:11,854
All right!
See, I told you it would be different here.

66
00:05:16,275 --> 00:05:18,985
Night and day.

67
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:20,778
Dear David Bowie,

68
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:23,907
there's one big advantage to
my new school over my old one: anonymity.

69
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:28,912
All those years of wishing I could
make myself invisible?

70
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:32,291
Turns out, all I had to do
was move to New Jersey.

71
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,717
Happy New Year, Van Buren! What's up?

72
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:46,137
I just have one question for you.

73
00:05:46,138 --> 00:05:49,140
What's gonna happen
3, 600 hours from right now?

74
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:52,269
- Bandslam!
- Bandslam!

75
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,937
And who's gonna bring home the gold?

76
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:56,063
- Glory Dogs!
- Glory Dogs!

77
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:59,193
Give it up for Ben Wheatly
and the Glory Dogs!

78
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:07,117
Lunch today was like
a Nuremberg rally produced by MTV.

79
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:09,660
Yes, you're number one!

80
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:12,246
Out of nowhere,
people were acting like maniacs

81
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:14,290
over something called Bandslam.

82
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:17,419
- I love you, Ben!
What's up, Van Buren?

83
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:24,050
All right.

84
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:27,179
As we all know, last year at Bandslam,

85
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:31,141
the Glory Dogs tied for second
with the Burning Hotels.

86
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:37,606
Well, that's not happening this year.
You know why?

87
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:39,148
Why?

88
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:42,026
'Cause there's some new dogs
in the pound.

89
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:44,362
First up, all the way from Montclair,

90
00:06:44,363 --> 00:06:47,491
Living with his dad, who he hates,
just to play with the Dogs:.

91
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:51,453
Dylan Dyer!

92
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:11,181
Exactly how big is
this whole Bandslam thing around here?

93
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:14,977
Texas high-school-football big.

94
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:17,979
- You're new.
- Yeah.

95
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:21,108
Let me see your class schedule.

96
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:35,496
We have Human Studies together.

97
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:38,625
What's your name?

98
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:41,919
Will Burton. What's yours?

99
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,048
Last, but certainly not least,
everybody loves a drummer.

100
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:50,637
We got a bad boy on the kit,
and his name is Boe!

101
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:54,390
The "5" is silent.

102
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:12,450
Kit is crazy.

103
00:08:12,451 --> 00:08:13,951
Incredible.

104
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:16,537
- What are you doing?
- Let me have a...

105
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:19,666
What are you doing?

106
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:32,178
Dear David Bowie,

107
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:35,307
today in my Human Studies class,
our teacher, Miss Wittenberg,

108
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:38,644
said the two words I dread more
than any others in the English language.

109
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:42,271
Buddy up.

110
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:45,274
This semester,
I want you to pick someone in the class

111
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:48,403
and create a presentation
that will show us who that person truly is.

112
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:54,826
Now, you can use photography,
poetry, video. Get creative, people.

113
00:08:57,788 --> 00:09:00,289
You'll have to get together after school.

114
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:03,418
We're gonna know each other
in ways we never expected.

115
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:12,678
Do you want to start?

116
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:14,512
What's your favorite color?

117
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:16,722
Come on. I mean,
we have to dig a little deeper than that.

118
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:19,852
This project counts for, like, half our grade.

119
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,608
Look, why don't we take each other
to, like, our most favorite spot

120
00:09:28,819 --> 00:09:31,362
and our least favorite spot
in the whole world?

121
00:09:31,363 --> 00:09:32,905
Okay.

122
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:35,449
Least favorite?

123
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:40,580
Done.

124
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:43,040
Most favorite?

125
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:46,169
- Can I get back to you on that?
- Why do you talk like that?

126
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:49,213
- Like what?
- Like that.

127
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:51,757
Why do you look like that?

128
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:54,887
- I just do.
- Same here.

129
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:59,057
I used to stutter.

130
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:02,644
Emotion is overrated.

131
00:10:02,728 --> 00:10:05,856
There may be a middle ground.

132
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:09,775
Idiots.

133
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:12,905
Morons.

134
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:21,996
Open. Right now.
Right now, right now, right now.

135
00:10:21,997 --> 00:10:25,125
- I'm sorry. Are you okay?
- Do not come near me!

136
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:33,758
Are you all right?

137
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:36,887
If anything happened to my cello,
I'm going to sue his parents.

138
00:10:37,596 --> 00:10:38,721
Seems all right.

139
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:41,850
It's impossible to tell until you play it.
It's not like it's a viola.

140
00:10:50,776 --> 00:10:53,904
Hey! Hey, Good Samaritan,
do you like kids?

141
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:57,281
- What?
- Do you like kids? It's a simple question.

142
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:58,824
Of course you do.
All Good Samaritans like kids.

143
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:01,786
It's in the handbook.
Come on, we don't have a lot of time.

144
00:11:01,787 --> 00:11:04,915
What?

145
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:09,461
- What is this?
- This is a daycare program

146
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:12,798
our fair school set up
with Lindsay Elementary around the corner.

147
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,514
- Beef jerky! Beef Jerky!
- Beef jerky! Beef Jerky!

148
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:24,643
Beef jerky. Teriyaki flavor.
They... They love it.

149
00:11:24,935 --> 00:11:26,185
Beef Jerky!
- Beef Jerky!

150
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:27,812
Okay, ready?

151
00:11:27,813 --> 00:11:30,106
You.

152
00:11:30,107 --> 00:11:31,899
Who's...

153
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:32,984
Oh, uh...

154
00:11:32,985 --> 00:11:36,113
That's Mr. Berry. He "supervises. "

155
00:11:36,655 --> 00:11:39,783
All right, everybody, sit down.
Come on, monsters.

156
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:43,828
- Name?
- Will. Will Burton.

157
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:45,413
Charlotte Barnes.

158
00:11:45,414 --> 00:11:48,542
Ladies and gentlemen,
Will Burton is in the house!

159
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:56,842
Can I have your iPod?

160
00:11:57,676 --> 00:11:59,552
Hey, Rory,
you want to listen to some of Will's music?

161
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:02,681
Is it like your band? Glory Dogs rock.

162
00:12:03,265 --> 00:12:05,933
Ex-band, Rory.

163
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:13,108
- They're not gonna want to listen to that.
- Halt.

164
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:21,783
Way to soothe the savage beast.

165
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,248
You are a weirdo, aren't you, Will Burton?

166
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:38,716
She wants you to do this every week?

167
00:12:38,717 --> 00:12:40,593
You know, just 'cause someone
tells you to do something

168
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:42,803
doesn't mean you have to do it.

169
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:43,930
Why is she still here?

170
00:12:43,931 --> 00:12:46,557
I thought you trained these dogs
at Aunt Nan's kennel.

171
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:49,686
She's getting placed tomorrow,
with a lady who has tummy issues.

172
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:53,607
Yeah. Right, Mazzy? Mazzy, Maalox.

173
00:12:56,193 --> 00:12:59,111
So, now, since when are you so interested
in daycare?

174
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,822
Since when do you talk to the dogs
like that?

175
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,952
Since when did you get so good
at changing the subject?

176
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,959
- That's appetizing.
- Yeah, and it's not Maalox. Mazzy, Maalox.

177
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:17,672
So, what's this Charlotte like?

178
00:13:17,673 --> 00:13:20,801
Not only is she the coolest person
who's ever spoken to me,

179
00:13:21,093 --> 00:13:24,221
she's potentially the coolest person
on the whole planet.

180
00:13:24,972 --> 00:13:28,100
But please,
don't make a big deal about it, okay?

181
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:32,144
- Is she pretty?
- Mom!

182
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,355
We are not going to sit here,
do each other's nails

183
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:37,484
and gossip about crushes, okay?
Not gonna happen.

184
00:13:45,242 --> 00:13:48,370
Tylenol is not Maalox.
Well, it's not a bad idea. High five!

185
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,356
You walk home from school?

186
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:20,485
School bus waits for no one.
Not even art class.

187
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:25,407
Hey, want to see the coolest place ever?

188
00:14:40,297 --> 00:14:43,425
- My dad used to bring me here.
- Is he dead?

189
00:14:44,426 --> 00:14:46,052
No. Take it back.

190
00:14:46,053 --> 00:14:49,181
I take it back. Sorry.
Just the way you were talking about him.

191
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:55,187
No, I'm sorry.

192
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:58,272
It's just last summer he got sick,

193
00:14:58,273 --> 00:15:01,401
and I don't like putting stuff like that
into the universe, you know?

194
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:09,826
Can I ask a question?

195
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:12,245
You're a senior.

196
00:15:12,246 --> 00:15:15,374
- Was that the end of the question?
- Why are you hanging out with me?

197
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:19,293
I don't do whys.
Okay. The Velvet Underground.

198
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,130
If I'm going to teach you the basics,
we might as well start with the best.

199
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:24,757
Well, actually,
if we're gonna start with the Velvets,

200
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:27,886
I'd rather listen to the 1969 self-titled
The Velvet Underground.

201
00:15:29,304 --> 00:15:32,432
Unless you think the band went downhill
when Lou Reed fired John Cale.

202
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:37,603
Who are you?

203
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:40,523
Will.

204
00:15:40,524 --> 00:15:43,025
Do you know a lot about music?

205
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:44,527
Yeah.

206
00:15:44,528 --> 00:15:47,656
- Why hasn't this come up before?
- We didn't really have a before.

207
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:50,366
Good point.

208
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:53,495
- My dad's a musician.
- No way. Have I heard of him?

209
00:15:54,329 --> 00:15:57,457
No, he's what they call a sideman.

210
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,751
If The Who need a keyboard
during their tour,

211
00:16:00,752 --> 00:16:03,504
or Sonic Youth wants a synth part
on a track...

212
00:16:03,505 --> 00:16:06,633
Wait, he tours with The Who?

213
00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:10,137
I know it sounds cool, but I mean,
it just means he's never around.

214
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:16,226
That's why my mom divorced him.

215
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:21,398
So, what's the deal with the whole
Bandslam thing? It's like a town obsession.

216
00:16:23,025 --> 00:16:26,153
Yeah. That's because the winner
gets an actual bona fide record deal.

217
00:16:27,571 --> 00:16:30,699
Seriously?
Yep. Seriously.

218
00:16:38,749 --> 00:16:41,877
Do any other bands from the school enter?

219
00:16:42,628 --> 00:16:45,756
Going up against Glory Dogs
would be like burning the American flag.

220
00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:55,557
- Then why'd you quit?
- I told you, I don't do whys.

221
00:17:01,063 --> 00:17:03,397
Besides, I'm thinking
of starting another band.

222
00:17:03,398 --> 00:17:05,524
Hey, come hear us jam on Saturday.

223
00:17:05,526 --> 00:17:08,654
Give us the benefit
of your vast musical knowledge.

224
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:12,533
- I don't really do well in groups.
- Always do the thing that scares you.

225
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:23,961
Hello, London!

226
00:17:41,645 --> 00:17:44,773
I want you to want me

227
00:17:45,774 --> 00:17:48,902
I need you to need me

228
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:52,948
I'd love you to love me, yeah

229
00:17:54,283 --> 00:17:57,411
And I'm begging you to beg me

230
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:01,874
Shine up the old brown shoes
Put on a brand-new shirt

231
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:06,253
Get home early from work
If you say that you love me

232
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:12,759
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you crying?

233
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,889
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you crying?

234
00:18:45,334 --> 00:18:47,460
- Who's this?
- Oh!

235
00:18:47,461 --> 00:18:50,589
Hey! This would be the coolest kid ever.

236
00:18:50,923 --> 00:18:53,966
Knows absolutely everything about music.

237
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:57,095
Guys, this is Will. Will, this is guys.

238
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:01,807
- What's up?
- So, what do you think?

239
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:03,643
I mean, it's pretty tasty, huh?

240
00:19:03,644 --> 00:19:06,772
Did you catch how, like, my bass line,
it shadowed his lead guitar?

241
00:19:07,105 --> 00:19:10,107
I mean, it was almost like I was a bodyguard
for his riff, dude. He was like...

242
00:19:11,193 --> 00:19:14,070
And I was like... And he was like...
And I was like... And he was like...

243
00:19:14,071 --> 00:19:17,199
Dear David Bowie, how do you tell
Pinocchio he'll never be a real boy?

244
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:21,202
Okay, okay!

245
00:19:21,203 --> 00:19:23,371
Okay!

246
00:19:23,372 --> 00:19:25,748
Look, I know you're going for this kind of

247
00:19:25,749 --> 00:19:28,292
Thin Lizzy, dual guitar,
third-above harmony.

248
00:19:28,293 --> 00:19:30,628
- Right.
- But, I mean, it's tough, sonically,

249
00:19:30,629 --> 00:19:33,757
to pull off, because you can't
get the bass sound fat enough,

250
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:36,927
or even in the same octave
to create any real presence.

251
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:41,348
Especially if your instruments
aren't exactly tuned to each other.

252
00:19:42,808 --> 00:19:45,017
- I bloody well told you!
- Did you? When?

253
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:48,145
Bug, you stupid git, I don't need any
more of your bloody nonsense.

254
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:50,231
I don't need any
of your bloody Englishisms.

255
00:19:50,232 --> 00:19:52,775
You're not English, Omar, you are
from Newark. Get that hand out of my...

256
00:19:52,776 --> 00:19:55,861
Hey, wait, wait, whoa, whoa. Can it.

257
00:19:55,863 --> 00:19:58,991
Look, we were afraid of sounding too slick.

258
00:19:59,741 --> 00:20:02,868
No, you're safe.

259
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,161
What else?

260
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:06,080
I mean,
they don't really want to hear what I...

261
00:20:06,081 --> 00:20:07,164
No, what else?

262
00:20:07,165 --> 00:20:09,834
I can't stress how badly
you need an actual drummer.

263
00:20:09,835 --> 00:20:12,962
Well, what about me, then?

264
00:20:12,963 --> 00:20:16,091
No offense, but it seems
like you're trying way too hard

265
00:20:16,133 --> 00:20:19,261
to be Flea from the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

266
00:20:19,511 --> 00:20:20,970
I am not.

267
00:20:20,971 --> 00:20:24,099
Okay. It's just with all the jumping around
and the shorts...

268
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:27,602
Come on, man. I don't want to be Flea.
I don't even like Flea.

269
00:20:27,603 --> 00:20:30,731
- Yeah, what's your name?
- Bug.

270
00:20:31,607 --> 00:20:34,735
- I mean, what's the band called, anyway?
- Glory Dogs.

271
00:20:35,235 --> 00:20:37,278
Isn't that the name of the other band?

272
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:40,323
No. They're Ben Wheatly
and the Glory Dogs.

273
00:20:40,324 --> 00:20:42,825
Like Bruce Springsteen
and the E Street Band,

274
00:20:42,826 --> 00:20:45,954
or Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.
You get it?

275
00:20:46,205 --> 00:20:49,333
That way, he can fire whoever he wants to
whenever he wants to,

276
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,752
and it stays his band.

277
00:20:52,753 --> 00:20:54,503
Look, are we through here,
because I'm starving.

278
00:20:54,504 --> 00:20:57,633
Yes. Come on.
So, Will, every Saturday at noon, right here.

279
00:20:58,133 --> 00:20:59,175
And don't be late.

280
00:20:59,176 --> 00:21:01,677
So, Omar, where exactly in England
is New Jersey?

281
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:03,179
Bug, leave it out.

282
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:06,308
Miles Feltenstien is a puzzle.

283
00:21:08,894 --> 00:21:12,022
An enigma.

284
00:21:16,443 --> 00:21:18,778
A sphinx.

285
00:21:21,532 --> 00:21:24,660
- So, I guess we should get together again.
Okay, sure. What about your house?

286
00:21:27,371 --> 00:21:29,705
Can you have friends over?

287
00:21:29,706 --> 00:21:32,834
Friends. Don't have those.

288
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:36,296
Me neither.

289
00:21:37,089 --> 00:21:40,217
Maybe we could not have friends together.

290
00:21:41,218 --> 00:21:44,346
Actually, I might have one friend.
You know Charlotte Barnes?

291
00:21:44,638 --> 00:21:47,766
- Since I was 10. She's a senior.
- Yeah, I thought that was weird, too.

292
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,352
So there's a 50% chance
that I might be the punch line

293
00:21:51,353 --> 00:21:54,063
to some elaborate practical joke,

294
00:21:54,064 --> 00:21:57,192
but she seems pretty sincere.
Are you friends?

295
00:21:57,776 --> 00:22:00,904
Ever hear a stutterer laugh?

296
00:22:01,405 --> 00:22:04,782
Ha.

297
00:22:04,783 --> 00:22:07,076
- Be careful, Will.
- Why?

298
00:22:07,077 --> 00:22:10,205
Leopards and cheerleaders
don't change their spots.

299
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,040
She's a cheerleader?

300
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:16,169
Was. Last year. Junior prom queen, too.

301
00:22:17,004 --> 00:22:20,132
That's amazing to me.
I mean, she seems so...

302
00:22:20,883 --> 00:22:22,466
Not.

303
00:22:22,467 --> 00:22:25,596
She's got her own Wikipedia page.

304
00:22:48,952 --> 00:22:52,080
You're head cheerleader?
I read your Wikipedia page.

305
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:56,168
Was. That was last year. Another life.

306
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:01,756
Hey, I notice you never say anything
about my vocals.

307
00:23:01,757 --> 00:23:03,966
Afraid I'll stop being your friend
if you rip me a new one?

308
00:23:03,967 --> 00:23:07,011
What? No. You're amazing.

309
00:23:07,012 --> 00:23:09,388
- Don't get infatuated with me.
- I'm not getting infatuated with you!

310
00:23:09,389 --> 00:23:12,517
Please, Louise!
You'd eat my laundry for a month if I asked.

311
00:23:15,604 --> 00:23:18,230
But I'm never going to ask you, Will.

312
00:23:18,232 --> 00:23:21,360
This has just become
my new least favorite memory.

313
00:23:23,987 --> 00:23:27,115
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we get it.

314
00:23:32,996 --> 00:23:36,124
Hey, Charlotte.

315
00:23:38,335 --> 00:23:40,169
- What's up, guys?
Hey.

316
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:42,296
What's going on? Omar.

317
00:23:42,297 --> 00:23:45,425
Hey, you got a little something
on your upper lip there.

318
00:23:45,634 --> 00:23:48,469
Don't talk to him.

319
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:51,305
Why? All right, what did I do?

320
00:23:51,306 --> 00:23:53,307
Do you have a head injury?

321
00:23:53,308 --> 00:23:55,017
I did not screw them over.

322
00:23:55,018 --> 00:23:58,146
I have a chance to play with my heroes,
you know?

323
00:23:58,772 --> 00:24:01,899
Dylan Dyer is an artist, right, Omar?
You said so yourself.

324
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:05,028
- He's all right.
- "He's all right"? The guy's a monster!

325
00:24:05,404 --> 00:24:08,532
- Well, what about loyalty?
- No one's saying you aren't good,

326
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:11,742
'cause you guys are good.
You guys are really good.

327
00:24:11,743 --> 00:24:13,494
We just have to be great, you know?

328
00:24:13,495 --> 00:24:16,581
And sometimes you just have to realize
when it's time to step aside.

329
00:24:16,582 --> 00:24:19,667
- Like right now. I have tables.
Why are you being like this?

330
00:24:19,668 --> 00:24:22,796
You quit before any of this
even happened with them.

331
00:24:23,672 --> 00:24:26,800
All right, can we just please
go somewhere and talk?

332
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:29,969
- I'm working.
- Okay, then tomorrow, after last period.

333
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:32,221
- I'm hanging out with Will.
- Who the heck is Will?

334
00:24:32,222 --> 00:24:35,350
That the heck is Will.
Say hello, the heck is Will.

335
00:24:36,101 --> 00:24:38,769
Hi.

336
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:40,479
You gotta be kidding me.

337
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,609
Will happens to be my friend
and the manager of my new band.

338
00:24:44,818 --> 00:24:46,694
- Whoa! Hey.
- What?

339
00:24:46,695 --> 00:24:49,823
- Your band? You guys are a band now?
- Yeah.

340
00:24:50,073 --> 00:24:52,700
- And he's your manager?
Yeah.

341
00:24:52,701 --> 00:24:55,077
- This is crazy!
- Holla.

342
00:24:55,078 --> 00:24:56,704
It gets worse.

343
00:24:56,705 --> 00:24:59,833
This year, Van Buren's
sending two bands to Bandslam.

344
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,667
What? What? No.

345
00:25:01,668 --> 00:25:03,252
You guys are going up against Glory Dogs?

346
00:25:03,253 --> 00:25:06,381
We are Glory Dogs!

347
00:25:07,507 --> 00:25:10,636
You have changed, Charlotte.
Everybody says so.

348
00:25:11,637 --> 00:25:14,765
Everybody's right.

349
00:25:22,189 --> 00:25:25,317
My cell phone died.

350
00:25:25,567 --> 00:25:27,902
- So, what happened?
- I got caught up.

351
00:25:27,903 --> 00:25:29,403
All day?

352
00:25:29,404 --> 00:25:31,906
With Charlotte.

353
00:25:31,907 --> 00:25:34,075
I'm managing her band.

354
00:25:34,076 --> 00:25:36,994
You're what?
I thought you were doing daycare.

355
00:25:36,995 --> 00:25:40,123
- She's very demanding.
- Well, shouldn't we talk about this?

356
00:25:41,542 --> 00:25:44,670
No. I think we should trust me.

357
00:25:44,795 --> 00:25:46,128
Well, I do trust you.

358
00:25:46,129 --> 00:25:49,258
It's just that five minutes ago
you were afraid to get on a school bus,

359
00:25:49,841 --> 00:25:52,009
and now you're managing a band.

360
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:54,845
It's all just moving a little fast,
don't you think?

361
00:25:54,846 --> 00:25:57,306
I made some friends, Mom.

362
00:25:57,307 --> 00:26:00,435
I know.
It's uncharted territory for both of us.

363
00:26:12,781 --> 00:26:14,240
Twizzler?

364
00:26:14,241 --> 00:26:17,369
Food of the gods.

365
00:26:21,415 --> 00:26:24,543
It's ska.

366
00:26:25,085 --> 00:26:26,836
I like it.

367
00:26:26,837 --> 00:26:29,965
- It's like reggae, but they made it their own.
- Exactly.

368
00:26:31,884 --> 00:26:34,510
There you are. Hey.

369
00:26:34,511 --> 00:26:37,639
Wait. Don't tell me you're the world-famous
Sa5m-the-5-is-silent.

370
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:41,518
For that alone, you are my hero.

371
00:26:41,685 --> 00:26:44,813
- I'm Charlotte. Nice to meet you.
- I've known you since fifth grade.

372
00:26:46,607 --> 00:26:49,442
You used to babysit me.

373
00:26:49,443 --> 00:26:51,736
Huh.

374
00:26:51,737 --> 00:26:54,865
Come on. Time for the ankle-biters.
They'll eat their own if we're late.

375
00:26:54,948 --> 00:26:58,076
- Are we still gonna meet up after school?
- Yeah, it's a date.

376
00:26:59,661 --> 00:27:02,789
Not like a "date" date. You know,
we're just working on a project for class.

377
00:27:04,374 --> 00:27:07,043
- It's not like we're dating.
- She gets it, Will.

378
00:27:07,044 --> 00:27:10,172
Okay. See you.

379
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:13,508
Nice seeing you again, Sa5m-the-5-is-silent.

380
00:27:14,051 --> 00:27:17,179
Genius.

381
00:27:20,349 --> 00:27:21,974
Dear David Bowie,

382
00:27:21,975 --> 00:27:25,103
despite my usual worries and fears
and complaints,

383
00:27:26,104 --> 00:27:29,233
Van Buren does not actually
completely suck.

384
00:27:38,909 --> 00:27:42,037
As for the band,
they finally agreed to add a drummer,

385
00:27:42,412 --> 00:27:45,373
but only if it's Basher Martin.

386
00:27:45,374 --> 00:27:47,833
Apparently, he's the best drummer
in school,

387
00:27:48,877 --> 00:27:52,005
but all he takes are auto shop
and anger management classes.

388
00:27:52,881 --> 00:27:55,132
Which he failed.

389
00:27:55,133 --> 00:27:58,262
Twice.

390
00:27:59,972 --> 00:28:03,100
I just have to be cool.
I just have to walk right up to him and say...

391
00:28:03,517 --> 00:28:06,645
Drums.

392
00:28:08,605 --> 00:28:11,733
What about them?

393
00:28:13,318 --> 00:28:15,945
Look. You can either say
what's on your mind,

394
00:28:15,946 --> 00:28:18,197
or take your little afro
and go ahead and scurry back...

395
00:28:18,198 --> 00:28:21,326
You play.

396
00:28:21,577 --> 00:28:24,705
Wow, this is hard.

397
00:28:24,913 --> 00:28:28,041
I'm Will. I manage this awesome band.

398
00:28:29,877 --> 00:28:32,128
We need a drummer for Bandslam.

399
00:28:32,129 --> 00:28:33,212
Hey, look, I'm sorry.

400
00:28:33,213 --> 00:28:36,341
You know, I need things in my life
that keep me calm.

401
00:28:37,175 --> 00:28:39,093
You know,
I hate the whole Bandslam thing.

402
00:28:39,094 --> 00:28:41,846
It's just a bunch of lemmings
chasing after a record deal,

403
00:28:41,847 --> 00:28:44,975
but they don't care about their art.

404
00:28:46,226 --> 00:28:48,311
You know, I care about art.

405
00:28:48,312 --> 00:28:51,440
And if you do too,
then how can this be enough for you?

406
00:28:51,899 --> 00:28:54,525
I mean, you're a musician,

407
00:28:54,526 --> 00:28:57,612
and here you are going through life,
passing people every day,

408
00:28:57,613 --> 00:29:00,741
and no one knows that inside,
you're this golden god.

409
00:29:03,327 --> 00:29:06,455
Don't you feel like Clark Kent?

410
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:11,168
I do kind of feel like Clark Kent.

411
00:29:14,796 --> 00:29:17,925
Look, I'll tell you what.
Have them make a rehearsal demo.

412
00:29:18,842 --> 00:29:20,676
I'll check it out, see how they sound.

413
00:29:20,677 --> 00:29:23,805
No. That would be like licking the pages
of a cookbook.

414
00:29:24,264 --> 00:29:27,392
You have to actually go hear them.
Play with them.

415
00:29:28,602 --> 00:29:30,311
Make them great.

416
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:36,776
Who's the babe?

417
00:29:36,777 --> 00:29:39,905
I dig older chicks 'cause they're
the only ones who really get me.

418
00:29:41,073 --> 00:29:43,324
That's my...

419
00:29:43,325 --> 00:29:46,327
Older sister.

420
00:29:46,328 --> 00:29:49,456
Well, she actually hangs out with the band,
like, all the time.

421
00:29:49,957 --> 00:29:53,085
All the time.

422
00:29:54,836 --> 00:29:57,965
So, you know...

423
00:30:01,552 --> 00:30:04,680
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you crying?

424
00:30:06,014 --> 00:30:09,142
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you crying?

425
00:30:12,145 --> 00:30:13,688
I can't believe I'm doing this.

426
00:30:13,689 --> 00:30:16,817
I have a very slim shot at being popular
if this whole band thing works out.

427
00:30:17,067 --> 00:30:20,195
You can help me do it.

428
00:30:21,363 --> 00:30:23,781
He is 17 years old!

429
00:30:23,782 --> 00:30:26,910
He likes older chicks.

430
00:30:30,455 --> 00:30:31,747
I look ridiculous.

431
00:30:31,748 --> 00:30:34,876
No, you look great. We'll run you
through a carwash on the way home.

432
00:30:37,045 --> 00:30:40,173
- How old did you tell him I was?
- Twenty-three.

433
00:30:48,307 --> 00:30:49,682
God!

434
00:30:49,683 --> 00:30:51,934
Dude, that was sick.

435
00:30:51,935 --> 00:30:55,063
Look, it was obviously better,
but we still need a fuller sound.

436
00:30:55,522 --> 00:30:57,064
- What?
- I'm thinking we bring in

437
00:30:57,065 --> 00:30:58,149
some more players, just for Bandslam.

438
00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:01,110
That's the dumbest idea I've ever heard.
Get out of my house.

439
00:31:01,111 --> 00:31:04,239
- We don't need any more players!
- Hey!

440
00:31:05,574 --> 00:31:07,950
We have a guest.

441
00:31:07,951 --> 00:31:10,036
Hi. Thanks.

442
00:31:10,037 --> 00:31:12,872
And Will's right. We probably should
bring in some other players.

443
00:31:12,873 --> 00:31:16,001
- You mean, like, use sidemen?
- Hold on, wait. Use what men?

444
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:18,669
Sidemen. Will's dad is a sideman.

445
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:21,798
Plays with lots of famous bands.
Is that what you meant, Will?

446
00:31:21,924 --> 00:31:25,052
Will's dad is joining the band?

447
00:31:25,177 --> 00:31:28,305
... these huge stadium crowds at that time,
and I'm thinking,

448
00:31:30,682 --> 00:31:33,142
"What are these people doing here?
Why have they come to see me?

449
00:31:33,143 --> 00:31:36,271
"They should be seeing Phil Collins.
They were definitely... "

450
00:31:36,396 --> 00:31:39,524
I'm taking a shower.
I'm taking three showers.

451
00:31:42,569 --> 00:31:43,861
Will, what's a sideman?

452
00:31:43,862 --> 00:31:46,405
'... your mother and I,
we tried to protect you from all this,

453
00:31:46,406 --> 00:31:49,367
"but... Well, if you must know,
your sister ran away. "

454
00:31:49,368 --> 00:31:52,496
"Why did you kill Ziggy?"
It was hard for all of us...

455
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,915
Yo, his name is Chet
and you know he's crunk

456
00:31:55,916 --> 00:31:58,042
He likes the girls that got the junk

457
00:31:58,043 --> 00:32:00,461
He's a paperboy
And he's making them bills

458
00:32:00,462 --> 00:32:02,838
He got these diamonds all up in his grills

459
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:04,799
He makes the grades from day to day

460
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,134
When he go to the club he don't gotta pay

461
00:32:07,135 --> 00:32:10,264
Hey, we're almost the only ones left to go.
We should get together.

462
00:32:10,681 --> 00:32:13,809
Soon, I promise, 'cause I really
have to work on the band now, you know?

463
00:32:13,934 --> 00:32:15,518
They have to sound fuller.

464
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:18,647
They're Living on Cheap Trick covers.
It's embarrassing.

465
00:32:19,147 --> 00:32:21,315
You don't have to. You want to.

466
00:32:21,316 --> 00:32:24,444
You haven't heard them.
Believe me, I have to.

467
00:32:26,738 --> 00:32:29,198
You want to.

468
00:32:29,199 --> 00:32:30,658
Dear David Bowie,

469
00:32:30,659 --> 00:32:32,618
first thing we need is a brass section.

470
00:32:32,619 --> 00:32:35,747
Though, granted, Van Buren
has a limited pool to choose from.

471
00:32:37,749 --> 00:32:40,710
The pianists around here are all classical.

472
00:32:50,762 --> 00:32:53,891
If Arcade Fire can have a cello,
we can have a cello.

473
00:32:54,099 --> 00:32:56,767
- Need a hand?
- Need a Stanford-Binet test?

474
00:32:56,768 --> 00:32:59,897
What? Sorry. It looked heavy.

475
00:33:01,064 --> 00:33:04,150
I have eight weeks
to turn them into an actual band.

476
00:33:04,151 --> 00:33:07,279
We need to take all this
psychotic energy and talent

477
00:33:07,571 --> 00:33:09,614
and turn it into something new.

478
00:33:09,615 --> 00:33:12,743
Okay, look, let's just start
by playing something simple.

479
00:33:14,578 --> 00:33:17,706
You guys ever heard of blue beat?

480
00:33:18,916 --> 00:33:22,044
Basher, get behind your drum kit.

481
00:33:23,295 --> 00:33:26,423
Please?

482
00:33:31,053 --> 00:33:34,181
All right, now, give me a Sly and Robbie
kind of groove, you know?

483
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,349
- Something 2 Tone.
- I don't do blue beat.

484
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:38,851
Everybody knows
you could beat that kit senseless,

485
00:33:38,852 --> 00:33:41,687
but real power is in holding back.

486
00:33:41,688 --> 00:33:44,816
Control, you know, finding a groove.
Come on.

487
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:47,568
Use some hi-hat.

488
00:33:49,947 --> 00:33:53,075
Okay, you know what a reggae groove is.
Cross stick.

489
00:33:53,784 --> 00:33:56,912
There we go. Kick drum.

490
00:33:58,538 --> 00:34:01,123
Sweet. No wonder you are a legend.

491
00:34:01,124 --> 00:34:04,253
All right, Bug, come on, come on.

492
00:34:04,461 --> 00:34:07,589
All right, listen to what he's doing
and try and play against it.

493
00:34:10,717 --> 00:34:13,845
Okay, that's good.

494
00:34:14,221 --> 00:34:17,349
There we go.

495
00:34:17,808 --> 00:34:20,936
That is what I'm talking about. That is what
you call a rhythm section. Everybody!

496
00:34:22,145 --> 00:34:24,605
Come on. Just make up your part.

497
00:34:24,606 --> 00:34:27,734
Don't worry about it being perfect, okay?

498
00:34:28,986 --> 00:34:32,114
Just make it fit to what you're hearing.

499
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:43,208
And after the one,
let me hear some trombone.

500
00:34:47,588 --> 00:34:50,716
Trumpet.

501
00:34:56,972 --> 00:35:00,100
And sax.

502
00:35:05,814 --> 00:35:08,942
Will Burton, you are amazing...

503
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:13,238
Mon.

504
00:35:14,114 --> 00:35:16,073
You guys are gonna sound great.

505
00:35:16,074 --> 00:35:18,743
But for Bandslam,
we need to find that one great song

506
00:35:18,744 --> 00:35:21,662
- that says who we really are.
- So what exactly are you looking for?

507
00:35:21,663 --> 00:35:23,581
I mean, I don't know,
but I will when I hear it.

508
00:35:23,582 --> 00:35:24,707
What else?

509
00:35:24,708 --> 00:35:27,168
All right, we have to talk
about the band name.

510
00:35:27,169 --> 00:35:29,462
I mean, there can't be two Glory Dogs.
There just can't.

511
00:35:29,463 --> 00:35:31,505
- Why? We are the Glory Dogs!
- We are the Glory Dogs. Yeah?

512
00:35:31,506 --> 00:35:33,299
Honestly, the name just sucks.

513
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:36,428
It's lame and generic
and sounds like a Springsteen cover band.

514
00:35:37,721 --> 00:35:40,849
Okay, well, what do you want to call us?

515
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:44,769
I Can't Go On, I'll Go On.

516
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:45,853
I Can't a What a What?

517
00:35:45,854 --> 00:35:48,982
I Can't Go On, I'll Go On.
It's evocative. It's memorable.

518
00:35:49,608 --> 00:35:51,943
It's ridiculous!
And it's not a name, all right?

519
00:35:51,944 --> 00:35:53,778
Don't say that!
- Glory Dogs, it says we're scruffy,

520
00:35:53,779 --> 00:35:56,155
- you know? We bite.
- You know, it is a name.

521
00:35:56,156 --> 00:35:58,908
Like Get Cape. Wear Cape. Fly,

522
00:35:58,909 --> 00:36:02,037
or Clap Your Hands Say Yeah,
which are both great bands.

523
00:36:02,204 --> 00:36:05,039
This is where I draw the line.
I am not giving Ben Glory Dogs!

524
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,666
Get your ego out of it!

525
00:36:06,667 --> 00:36:08,668
Will knows more about this stuff
in his little finger

526
00:36:08,669 --> 00:36:10,419
than the rest of us put together.

527
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:13,548
You actually think we were better
before Will came along?

528
00:36:14,633 --> 00:36:17,761
Yeah, we were a joke.
Now we have a shot at being a band.

529
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:21,430
Come on, to I Can't Go On, I'll Go On!

530
00:36:21,431 --> 00:36:24,560
Fine. Fine.

531
00:36:38,323 --> 00:36:41,451
- How was your day?
Inappropriate! Inappropriate!

532
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:44,203
- Honey, I was just...
- Taking a shower!

533
00:36:44,204 --> 00:36:46,831
Years from now, some shrink will pick out
this moment in time...

534
00:36:46,832 --> 00:36:49,960
Fine, fine, but hurry up.

535
00:36:59,636 --> 00:37:02,764
You're pulling away from me. A little bit.

536
00:37:02,931 --> 00:37:06,059
And I don't know how I feel about it.
I just... I have to say that out loud.

537
00:37:07,436 --> 00:37:09,770
We are not having this discussion now.

538
00:37:09,771 --> 00:37:12,315
Can we continue this after rehearsal?

539
00:37:12,316 --> 00:37:15,444
Please?

540
00:37:34,755 --> 00:37:37,883
On the seventh hour of the seventh day

541
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:43,847
The seventh son was looking
for a seventh-stage getaway

542
00:37:45,933 --> 00:37:49,061
The word came down from a blinding light

543
00:37:51,772 --> 00:37:54,900
You got one chance, baby
Baby, you better do it right

544
00:37:56,401 --> 00:37:59,529
Well, I was driving down on the 101

545
00:38:02,699 --> 00:38:05,827
And it was late at night and I was thinking
about the things I'd done

546
00:38:07,621 --> 00:38:10,164
All of my regrets

547
00:38:10,165 --> 00:38:13,293
And baby, all of my fears

548
00:38:13,752 --> 00:38:16,880
Yeah, I was slipping the car
From gear to gear to gear

549
00:38:18,632 --> 00:38:21,760
Hey, hey, hey

550
00:38:29,768 --> 00:38:32,520
Godbless the child

551
00:38:32,521 --> 00:38:35,649
Godbless his soul

552
00:38:35,857 --> 00:38:38,986
God perish the idea
that he'll die before he's old

553
00:38:40,821 --> 00:38:43,239
You gotta be cool

554
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:46,368
You got to behave

555
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:50,038
Man, there'll be a time for that
when I'm lying in my grave

556
00:38:51,456 --> 00:38:54,585
You gotta watch your step
or you'll lose your way

557
00:38:57,754 --> 00:39:00,882
Take heed of the others
and do everything they say

558
00:39:02,593 --> 00:39:05,594
Watch out for the man

559
00:39:05,596 --> 00:39:08,723
Who never tolls the bells

560
00:39:08,724 --> 00:39:11,601
'Cause if I fear for the devil
and I fear for myself

561
00:39:11,602 --> 00:39:14,730
Then I'm gonna have to fear
for everybody else

562
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:18,024
I'm gonna fly

563
00:39:19,526 --> 00:39:21,861
And I'm gonna live

564
00:39:21,862 --> 00:39:24,655
Until the day I die

565
00:39:24,656 --> 00:39:27,533
And I ain't got time

566
00:39:27,534 --> 00:39:30,620
To wonder why

567
00:39:30,621 --> 00:39:32,663
I'm gonna live

568
00:39:32,664 --> 00:39:35,792
Till the day I die

569
00:40:32,057 --> 00:40:34,976
We still have that stupid
Human Studies project to finish,

570
00:40:34,977 --> 00:40:38,105
and we haven't hung out
since you've become Joe Cool Rock 'n' Roll.

571
00:40:39,064 --> 00:40:40,940
You still haven't taken me
to your favorite place.

572
00:40:40,941 --> 00:40:44,069
- 'Cause I've never been there.
- How can it be your favorite place, then?

573
00:40:46,363 --> 00:40:49,491
What?

574
00:41:05,132 --> 00:41:08,260
Will.

575
00:41:09,678 --> 00:41:11,554
What now? Huh?

576
00:41:11,555 --> 00:41:14,683
Got you.

577
00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:20,647
Oh, no.

578
00:41:45,631 --> 00:41:48,759
- Check it out.
- Cool.

579
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:40,267
CBGB's.

580
00:42:40,269 --> 00:42:43,397
The nerve center of everything that mattered
in music in the past 40 years,

581
00:42:45,691 --> 00:42:48,819
and it closed
before I ever got to step inside.

582
00:42:49,736 --> 00:42:52,864
Now they're turning it
into some cheesy clothing store.

583
00:42:54,575 --> 00:42:57,703
It's better that way.
Now it can never disappoint you.

584
00:43:05,586 --> 00:43:08,714
What are you doing?

585
00:43:17,222 --> 00:43:20,350
Come on.

586
00:43:47,878 --> 00:43:51,006
- Look at it.
- Yeah, it's a toilet.

587
00:43:51,757 --> 00:43:54,216
Are you kidding me?

588
00:43:54,217 --> 00:43:57,346
Birthplace of punk!

589
00:43:58,430 --> 00:44:01,558
The Ramones.

590
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:05,061
Patti Smith.

591
00:44:05,062 --> 00:44:08,190
Do you know how many times
she must've spit on this floor?

592
00:44:09,816 --> 00:44:11,609
Bad Brains.

593
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:14,738
Without CBGB's,
there'd be no Sex Pistols or The Clash.

594
00:44:15,739 --> 00:44:18,867
So U2 doesn't get inspired
to form a band in Ireland.

595
00:44:19,326 --> 00:44:22,454
And the Killers don't hear U2 in Vegas
and decide to pick up guitars.

596
00:44:23,956 --> 00:44:27,084
The list is endless!

597
00:44:27,209 --> 00:44:30,337
Wow. I'm starting to feel
like a Japanese tourist.

598
00:44:35,801 --> 00:44:38,929
Then the rent got jacked, like, 2,000%.

599
00:44:40,472 --> 00:44:43,600
So now CBGB's is just a T-shirt
Paris Hilton wears if she wants to look cool.

600
00:44:50,857 --> 00:44:53,986
I knew it'd be my favorite place.

601
00:44:54,987 --> 00:44:58,115
So, what's yours?

602
00:44:58,865 --> 00:45:01,994
Now this is.

603
00:45:22,973 --> 00:45:24,181
It's all right. You lived.

604
00:45:24,182 --> 00:45:27,311
I think if you tried signaling,
people would honk less.

605
00:45:27,686 --> 00:45:30,814
- They don't need to know my business.
- It's not really a privacy issue.

606
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:34,942
Pretty good rehearsal today,
don't you think?

607
00:45:34,943 --> 00:45:37,820
So, what's up with you and Sa5m?

608
00:45:37,821 --> 00:45:39,989
- You like her.
- She's my friend.

609
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:42,908
- No, you "like her" like her.
- Shut up.

610
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:45,911
- Have you kissed her yet?
- No.

611
00:45:45,913 --> 00:45:47,204
Have you ever kissed any girl?

612
00:45:47,205 --> 00:45:50,166
Remember how I said that "eating
your laundry for a month" conversation

613
00:45:50,167 --> 00:45:53,295
was my least favorite memory?
We have a new champion.

614
00:45:54,504 --> 00:45:56,672
You gotta go for her. Carpe diem.

615
00:45:56,673 --> 00:45:59,300
You're crazy. She'd laugh at me.

616
00:45:59,301 --> 00:46:02,219
Trust me, that girl is one kiss away
from doodling "Mrs. Will Burton"

617
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:05,349
all over her sneakers.

618
00:46:06,642 --> 00:46:09,770
I wouldn't even know what to do.

619
00:46:13,231 --> 00:46:16,360
Okay. I only do this for people with dazzling
artistic ability and whose initials are W. B.

620
00:46:19,154 --> 00:46:20,571
Come here.

621
00:46:20,572 --> 00:46:23,658
Don't have an aneurysm.
This is strictly educational.

622
00:46:23,659 --> 00:46:26,787
Commit everything I do and say to memory.
How you handle this moment with Sa5m

623
00:46:27,746 --> 00:46:30,874
will haunt you, good or bad,
for the rest of your life.

624
00:46:33,293 --> 00:46:35,044
All right.

625
00:46:35,045 --> 00:46:38,173
First, start by gently moving
a strand of hair from her face.

626
00:46:40,259 --> 00:46:43,387
Go ahead.

627
00:46:45,639 --> 00:46:48,767
Allows you to touch her
without freaking her out.

628
00:46:50,811 --> 00:46:52,103
Nice.

629
00:46:52,104 --> 00:46:55,232
Now that your hand is there,
turn it into a caress down her cheek.

630
00:47:00,487 --> 00:47:03,615
Once you've made physical contact,
never cede your ground.

631
00:47:05,075 --> 00:47:07,118
It's very important.

632
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:10,247
Now, lower your hand
to the back of her neck.

633
00:47:13,875 --> 00:47:17,004
Then lean in. Slowly. Slowly.

634
00:47:18,338 --> 00:47:21,132
Breathe.

635
00:47:21,133 --> 00:47:24,261
Slight parting of the lips, and...

636
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:43,488
I bet you'll never forget that song
for the rest of your life.

637
00:47:45,282 --> 00:47:48,410
Night, Will.

638
00:48:01,506 --> 00:48:04,635
Good night, Charlotte.

639
00:48:05,969 --> 00:48:09,097
I am so going to heaven.

640
00:48:23,737 --> 00:48:26,865
Hello, Mother.

641
00:48:44,049 --> 00:48:47,177
- Morning.
- Morning.

642
00:48:52,349 --> 00:48:55,477
You busy after school?
Have you ever been to the Overlook?

643
00:48:57,312 --> 00:49:00,440
What's the Overlook?

644
00:49:01,275 --> 00:49:04,403
What?

645
00:49:11,034 --> 00:49:14,162
Dear David Bowie,
I wouldn't tell anyone this but you.

646
00:49:19,042 --> 00:49:21,669
Boy, you sure like to read, huh?

647
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:24,798
My shrink says it allows me
to control something in my life.

648
00:49:25,465 --> 00:49:28,092
This was it,
the moment that would haunt me,

649
00:49:28,093 --> 00:49:31,221
for better or worse,
for the entire rest of my life.

650
00:49:32,598 --> 00:49:35,726
Start with a strand of hair.

651
00:49:38,103 --> 00:49:41,231
She's wearing a hat!

652
00:49:44,901 --> 00:49:48,030
- What are you doing?
- You...

653
00:49:53,952 --> 00:49:57,080
What was next? Caress!

654
00:50:01,126 --> 00:50:04,254
This was not a caress.
This was petting. I'm petting her.

655
00:50:11,178 --> 00:50:14,306
Okay, enough. This was it.

656
00:51:03,939 --> 00:51:07,067
Have you seen Evil Dead II?

657
00:51:09,319 --> 00:51:11,612
No.

658
00:51:11,613 --> 00:51:14,323
It's my favorite movie ever.

659
00:51:14,324 --> 00:51:16,033
You never get to see it in a theatre,

660
00:51:16,034 --> 00:51:19,036
but it's playing at the college
Saturday night.

661
00:51:19,037 --> 00:51:22,165
They don't card anyone there.
Would you want to go?

662
00:51:23,834 --> 00:51:26,962
Sure. I'd love to.

663
00:51:27,879 --> 00:51:31,008
Cool.

664
00:51:31,383 --> 00:51:34,511
All in all, I think it went pretty well.
Your number-one fan, Will Burton.

665
00:51:51,987 --> 00:51:55,115
But it's fun, it's fun.
You know, I've been in a few bands, and...

666
00:51:59,912 --> 00:52:02,496
Boy, you tied the heck
out of that shoe.

667
00:52:02,497 --> 00:52:04,040
Considering it was already tied
and everything.

668
00:52:04,041 --> 00:52:07,169
- Can't be too careful.
- You don't have an inhaler, do you?

669
00:52:07,461 --> 00:52:09,795
'Cause if you do,
you might want to get it ready.

670
00:52:09,796 --> 00:52:11,339
- No!
- Yeah.

671
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:13,007
You're getting a sneak peek
at the competition,

672
00:52:13,008 --> 00:52:14,592
and I'm not talking Glory Dogs.

673
00:52:14,593 --> 00:52:17,136
Burning Hotels?
But I didn't think there was any way that...

674
00:52:17,137 --> 00:52:20,265
Where there's a will...

675
00:52:22,601 --> 00:52:25,144
Dear David Bowie,
I know it's not saying much,

676
00:52:25,145 --> 00:52:28,273
but this is the coolest thing
that ever happened to me.

677
00:52:37,366 --> 00:52:39,950
I got in, you got out

678
00:52:39,952 --> 00:52:42,703
I walked in, you walked out

679
00:52:42,704 --> 00:52:45,832
As usual I'm stuck in the middle

680
00:52:48,335 --> 00:52:51,087
I'm closer to closure

681
00:52:51,088 --> 00:52:53,881
Admitting that it's over

682
00:52:53,882 --> 00:52:57,010
As usual I'm stuck in the middle

683
00:52:59,012 --> 00:53:01,847
And now you know

684
00:53:01,848 --> 00:53:04,977
That you control everything

685
00:53:05,102 --> 00:53:08,230
As usual I'm stuck in the middle

686
00:53:09,773 --> 00:53:12,108
And now I'm drowning

687
00:53:12,109 --> 00:53:13,150
Where's Will?

688
00:53:13,151 --> 00:53:15,778
In myself again

689
00:53:15,779 --> 00:53:18,364
Yes, I'm drowning

690
00:53:18,365 --> 00:53:21,493
In myself again

691
00:53:46,101 --> 00:53:49,229
White at night

692
00:53:50,731 --> 00:53:53,859
I am dead

693
00:53:58,405 --> 00:54:01,533
White at night

694
00:54:03,035 --> 00:54:06,163
I am dead

695
00:54:10,292 --> 00:54:15,504
Who knows how I got out?

696
00:54:15,505 --> 00:54:18,634
As usual I'm stuck in the middle

697
00:54:38,236 --> 00:54:41,365
I am such a jerk. But it was Burning Hotels!

698
00:54:41,782 --> 00:54:44,910
I had to see the competition.
Don't I get a Burning Hotels pardon?

699
00:54:45,744 --> 00:54:48,204
Tell me one thing.

700
00:54:48,205 --> 00:54:51,333
- Were you with her?
- Yeah.

701
00:54:53,961 --> 00:54:56,212
Are you in love with Charlotte?

702
00:54:56,213 --> 00:54:57,922
What?

703
00:54:57,923 --> 00:54:59,882
- You are.
- I'm not.

704
00:54:59,883 --> 00:55:03,011
- I'm not.
- You had a thing. I don't care.

705
00:55:06,390 --> 00:55:09,518
Look, just remember.
She's trouble. Girls like that always are.

706
00:55:11,895 --> 00:55:15,023
That's ridiculous.
I'm not in love with Charlotte.

707
00:55:15,774 --> 00:55:18,902
You still haven't washed your hand yet.
It was that special, being with her.

708
00:55:37,129 --> 00:55:38,212
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

709
00:55:38,213 --> 00:55:40,464
Sa5m should be home any minute.

710
00:55:40,465 --> 00:55:42,967
What is this project
that you're working on about?

711
00:55:42,968 --> 00:55:46,096
Each other. We're supposed to show
the class who the other person really is.

712
00:55:48,265 --> 00:55:50,308
Yeah.

713
00:55:57,566 --> 00:56:00,694
You sheltered me from harm

714
00:56:01,778 --> 00:56:04,906
Kept me warm

715
00:56:05,032 --> 00:56:08,160
Kept me warm

716
00:56:10,203 --> 00:56:13,332
You gave my life to me

717
00:56:14,499 --> 00:56:18,294
Set me free

718
00:56:18,295 --> 00:56:21,423
It was a competition. She didn't win.

719
00:56:23,383 --> 00:56:26,511
Yeah. Judges were idiots.

720
00:56:27,304 --> 00:56:28,804
Morons.

721
00:56:28,805 --> 00:56:31,934
All the years I had with you

722
00:56:32,517 --> 00:56:35,646
And I would give everything I own

723
00:56:39,024 --> 00:56:42,152
I'd give up my life, my heart, my home

724
00:56:45,364 --> 00:56:48,492
I would give everything I own

725
00:56:51,703 --> 00:56:53,746
What are you doing?

726
00:56:53,747 --> 00:56:56,540
- Here we go.
- What's wrong? That was amazing.

727
00:56:56,541 --> 00:56:59,543
- I can't believe you showed that to him.
- Why not? What's the big deal?

728
00:56:59,544 --> 00:57:01,379
Why are you here?

729
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:04,508
- I came to apologize again.
- Just go.

730
00:57:08,220 --> 00:57:11,097
She'll forgive you.
I happen to be a girl. I know these things.

731
00:57:11,098 --> 00:57:14,226
Yeah. Okay.

732
00:57:16,228 --> 00:57:19,356
Hey, we got our first post.
"Lower your mortgage rates now. "

733
00:57:20,190 --> 00:57:23,318
Does spam count?

734
00:57:32,744 --> 00:57:35,246
You weren't reading my IM, were you?

735
00:57:35,247 --> 00:57:36,872
You mean the one from Phil
that said "love you"?

736
00:57:36,873 --> 00:57:37,915
- Yeah.
- No.

737
00:57:37,916 --> 00:57:41,044
Good.

738
00:57:41,837 --> 00:57:43,921
He's my dad.

739
00:57:43,922 --> 00:57:47,050
- And you call him Phil?
- That's his name.

740
00:57:54,641 --> 00:57:57,769
Hi. I've been looking for you.

741
00:57:57,978 --> 00:58:01,106
Well, you found me.

742
00:58:08,238 --> 00:58:11,366
I went back up to Hunter Mountain again.
Got stuck on the exact same lift as last year.

743
00:58:13,493 --> 00:58:15,745
No way.
Seriously.

744
00:58:15,746 --> 00:58:18,874
It seems it's not as magical
when you're by yourself.

745
00:58:19,249 --> 00:58:20,875
What'd you do?

746
00:58:20,876 --> 00:58:24,004
Same thing I did last year.
I cried like a little girl.

747
00:58:27,007 --> 00:58:28,799
Listen, Charlotte.

748
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:31,929
I was thinking that maybe it's time for you
to give me another chance.

749
00:58:32,095 --> 00:58:34,347
Look...

750
00:58:36,516 --> 00:58:39,645
- What's this?
- This is me risking complete humiliation.

751
00:58:49,446 --> 00:58:52,574
Say, won't you stay

752
00:58:53,283 --> 00:58:55,326
We can talk about nothing at all

753
00:58:55,327 --> 00:58:58,455
You are so corny.

754
00:58:58,997 --> 00:59:02,125
Or sit here and make up the words

755
00:59:02,209 --> 00:59:05,337
As we go along

756
00:59:06,713 --> 00:59:09,674
They told me maybe she's crazy

757
00:59:09,675 --> 00:59:12,176
A little like you

758
00:59:12,177 --> 00:59:15,305
Everyone said you were nothing but trouble

759
00:59:16,181 --> 00:59:19,309
And all that I know
is that I've never been here before

760
00:59:22,479 --> 00:59:25,607
I don't need to pretend anymore

761
00:59:33,824 --> 00:59:36,492
Strange, so strange

762
00:59:36,493 --> 00:59:37,827
You are hilarious.

763
00:59:37,828 --> 00:59:40,956
When it feels better being alone

764
00:59:41,999 --> 00:59:45,127
You'll accept there is nobody else

765
00:59:45,752 --> 00:59:48,087
Then set it in stone

766
00:59:50,257 --> 00:59:53,384
And they told me maybe she's crazy

767
00:59:53,385 --> 00:59:55,219
A little like you

768
00:59:56,263 --> 00:59:59,391
Everyone said...

769
01:00:03,854 --> 01:00:06,982
Will and I were just updating our band's
MySpace page.

770
01:00:16,450 --> 01:00:19,578
You know that kid, Will Burton?
Do some recon.

771
01:00:19,870 --> 01:00:20,953
Find out everything you can about him.

772
01:00:20,954 --> 01:00:24,082
They'll have his records in the office.
Where he's from, where he went to school.

773
01:00:24,333 --> 01:00:27,418
His guidance counsellor report,
that'll have all the good stuff. All right?

774
01:00:27,419 --> 01:00:29,086
Everything. And do it today.

775
01:00:29,087 --> 01:00:32,048
Whoa. Yo, dude,
we don't actually work for you.

776
01:00:32,049 --> 01:00:35,177
It's not like you're the Joker
and we're your henchmen.

777
01:00:37,512 --> 01:00:40,641
Fine. I'll do it myself.

778
01:00:41,141 --> 01:00:44,269
All right, best for last. Sa5m, Will?
Tell us who you are.

779
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:57,908
My project is Will Burton.

780
01:00:59,034 --> 01:01:02,162
I'm pointing
because it's hard to tell who he is.

781
01:01:04,122 --> 01:01:07,250
I was going to use photographs
for this presentation,

782
01:01:07,793 --> 01:01:10,921
but then I realized, the real Will Burton
can't be captured on film.

783
01:01:14,466 --> 01:01:17,426
Instead,

784
01:01:17,427 --> 01:01:20,179
you need this.

785
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:23,308
Will is a reflective surface.

786
01:01:23,725 --> 01:01:26,853
He mirrors back at you
whatever you want to see.

787
01:01:28,272 --> 01:01:31,400
He reflects you back to you.

788
01:01:31,483 --> 01:01:34,611
And it's nice for awhile.

789
01:01:34,778 --> 01:01:37,655
You stop feeling lonely.

790
01:01:37,656 --> 01:01:40,784
But then you realize,
he's doing that with everyone.

791
01:01:44,788 --> 01:01:47,916
The only person he can't do it for

792
01:01:48,834 --> 01:01:50,543
is Will.

793
01:01:50,544 --> 01:01:53,672
Because he doesn't have a clue

794
01:01:53,755 --> 01:01:56,883
who he is.

795
01:02:06,935 --> 01:02:09,979
Okay, well, that was very creative.

796
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:13,108
And really mean. Okay, Will, you're up.

797
01:03:10,582 --> 01:03:13,710
If I told you things I did before

798
01:03:14,086 --> 01:03:17,214
Told you how I used to be

799
01:03:17,506 --> 01:03:20,634
Would you go along with someone like me?

800
01:03:24,263 --> 01:03:27,391
If you knew my story word for word

801
01:03:28,058 --> 01:03:31,186
Had all of my history

802
01:03:31,478 --> 01:03:34,606
Would you go along with someone like me?

803
01:03:37,150 --> 01:03:40,279
And we don't care about the young folks

804
01:03:41,029 --> 01:03:44,031
Talking about the young style

805
01:03:44,032 --> 01:03:47,159
And we don't care about the old folks

806
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:50,289
Talking about the old style too

807
01:03:50,998 --> 01:03:54,126
And we don't care about our own faults

808
01:03:54,918 --> 01:03:57,962
Talking about our own style

809
01:03:57,963 --> 01:04:00,756
All we care about is talking

810
01:04:00,757 --> 01:04:03,885
Talking only me and you

811
01:04:04,928 --> 01:04:08,056
And we don't care about the young folks

812
01:04:08,765 --> 01:04:11,892
Talking about the young style

813
01:04:11,893 --> 01:04:14,895
And we don't care about the old folks

814
01:04:14,896 --> 01:04:18,025
Talking about the old style too

815
01:04:18,817 --> 01:04:21,945
And we don't care about our own faults

816
01:04:22,487 --> 01:04:25,573
Talking about our own style

817
01:04:25,574 --> 01:04:28,702
All we care about is talking

818
01:04:28,785 --> 01:04:31,913
Talking only me and you

819
01:04:32,289 --> 01:04:34,749
Talking only me and you

820
01:04:42,883 --> 01:04:44,550
Dear David Bowie,

821
01:04:44,551 --> 01:04:47,679
sometimes it seems like things
actually work out.

822
01:04:53,852 --> 01:04:56,980
English, Irene. English. There is
no such thing as conversational Elvish.

823
01:05:00,859 --> 01:05:03,987
Sorry, Dewey.

824
01:05:05,864 --> 01:05:08,240
It's what they call you, isn't it?

825
01:05:08,241 --> 01:05:09,617
No.

826
01:05:09,618 --> 01:05:12,746
It was at your last school.
Or do you prefer "Junior"?

827
01:05:12,788 --> 01:05:15,414
Do you know your buddy,
his full name is Will Burton, Jr.?

828
01:05:15,415 --> 01:05:16,957
Did you know that I don't care?

829
01:05:16,959 --> 01:05:18,793
Well, he told you
his dad was famous, right?

830
01:05:18,794 --> 01:05:21,754
Or infamous, right, Dewey?
I mean, you still close to the old man?

831
01:05:21,755 --> 01:05:23,547
You probably don't get to talk to him
much anymore, do you?

832
01:05:23,548 --> 01:05:26,677
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Well, I think you do, Dewey.

833
01:05:27,469 --> 01:05:30,597
I think you do, Dewey.

834
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:40,148
Okay, that was surreal. Are you okay?

835
01:05:40,983 --> 01:05:44,111
I don't... I got... I gotta...

836
01:05:54,329 --> 01:05:56,539
What are you doing?

837
01:05:56,540 --> 01:05:59,668
You didn't answer my texts,
and you left me alone with the monsters.

838
01:06:00,127 --> 01:06:02,294
Sorry, I'm sick.

839
01:06:02,296 --> 01:06:05,424
My spidey-sense tells me you're lying.

840
01:06:06,883 --> 01:06:09,260
I'm thinking about changing schools.

841
01:06:09,261 --> 01:06:12,389
No way, my little friend. I'm not facing
the Neanderthals without you.

842
01:06:12,681 --> 01:06:15,809
Besides, if you change schools,
then you can't gain access to this.

843
01:06:19,229 --> 01:06:21,856
- What's that?
- Something private.

844
01:06:21,857 --> 01:06:24,985
Something I would only show
the manager of my band.

845
01:06:25,569 --> 01:06:28,529
Or my best friend.

846
01:06:28,530 --> 01:06:31,658
Scooch.

847
01:06:32,034 --> 01:06:35,162
Okay. You said we needed one song
that says who we are.

848
01:06:35,537 --> 01:06:38,665
Well, these say who I am.

849
01:06:41,084 --> 01:06:44,212
Little brothers.

850
01:06:44,504 --> 01:06:47,633
Little brothers again.

851
01:06:49,259 --> 01:06:51,344
- For your dad?
- No.

852
01:06:51,345 --> 01:06:53,929
Not for him, exactly.

853
01:06:53,930 --> 01:06:56,265
Inspired by him, I guess.
You know, things he said to me.

854
01:06:56,266 --> 01:06:59,394
But it's not just about my dad anymore.
That'd be, hello, weird.

855
01:06:59,853 --> 01:07:02,897
It's about everything.

856
01:07:02,898 --> 01:07:05,232
Wow, that's articulate.

857
01:07:05,233 --> 01:07:06,567
You know, there's other stuff in here, too.

858
01:07:06,568 --> 01:07:09,696
- I'm not saying any of it's good...
- Thanks.

859
01:07:10,072 --> 01:07:13,200
Hey. By accepting this, it means that there
will be no more talk of changing schools.

860
01:07:15,953 --> 01:07:19,081
Agreed?

861
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:22,833
- Man, I'm good.
- Charlotte!

862
01:07:22,834 --> 01:07:25,544
- Charlotte! My mom is in the...
- I knew you were ticklish.

863
01:07:25,545 --> 01:07:28,674
You are so ticklish, I knew it.

864
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:32,928
Somebody wanna tell me
what's going on in here?

865
01:07:36,056 --> 01:07:38,099
Get off his bed.

866
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:40,309
Wait. You don't think...

867
01:07:41,395 --> 01:07:43,938
I saw you kiss him in the car.

868
01:07:43,939 --> 01:07:46,148
Well, that was
for educational purposes only.

869
01:07:46,149 --> 01:07:47,274
I wanna die.

870
01:07:47,276 --> 01:07:49,819
Did you hear that? He wants to die.
He needs help, Karen.

871
01:07:49,820 --> 01:07:52,029
Then I'll help him. I'm his mom.

872
01:07:52,030 --> 01:07:54,198
But I am wise in the ways of Will.

873
01:07:54,199 --> 01:07:57,327
I'm actually here, you know. These covers
don't literally make me disappear.

874
01:07:58,829 --> 01:08:01,414
You know what I think?
I think you're full of it, Charlotte.

875
01:08:01,415 --> 01:08:03,916
And when I think someone's full of it,
I don't trust them.

876
01:08:03,917 --> 01:08:06,002
Mom, will you stop interfering?

877
01:08:06,003 --> 01:08:08,963
Sorry, I'm not your friend,
I'm your mother. That's my job.

878
01:08:08,964 --> 01:08:12,092
No, Mom, you're supposed to give me
a little breathing room so I can have a life,

879
01:08:13,427 --> 01:08:15,886
instead of just saying that's what you want.

880
01:08:15,887 --> 01:08:18,723
- He's got a point, Karen.
- And you, I'm not a manager.

881
01:08:18,724 --> 01:08:21,852
I don't take on the biggest band
in school and change destiny. I can't.

882
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:27,608
Will you both just please leave me alone?

883
01:08:32,195 --> 01:08:35,324
Get out.

884
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:48,629
- Somebody called me Dewey today.
- What? How?

885
01:08:49,046 --> 01:08:52,174
- He must've found out about Dad.
- I hate them all.

886
01:08:52,257 --> 01:08:54,633
- Me too.
- You, however, I love.

887
01:08:54,635 --> 01:08:57,763
Yeah, but you married Dad.
We can't really trust your taste.

888
01:08:59,097 --> 01:09:02,225
I was 19. And he was a drummer.

889
01:09:02,935 --> 01:09:06,063
And overnight it made my mother
finally take me seriously,

890
01:09:06,355 --> 01:09:07,897
which is really all I wanted.

891
01:09:07,898 --> 01:09:09,023
- Mom?
- I... What?

892
01:09:09,024 --> 01:09:12,152
You're doing that thing
where you talk to me like I'm Oprah.

893
01:09:12,235 --> 01:09:15,364
I'll tell you this, though.
I'd marry him all over again to get you.

894
01:09:21,912 --> 01:09:25,040
I promise you're going to get
everything you deserve out of life.

895
01:09:26,083 --> 01:09:29,211
And a little bit of the next guy's.

896
01:09:39,429 --> 01:09:42,348
I'll never be

897
01:09:42,349 --> 01:09:45,477
A knight in armor with a sword in hand

898
01:09:47,688 --> 01:09:50,816
Ora kamikaze fighter

899
01:09:51,858 --> 01:09:54,777
Don't count on me

900
01:09:54,778 --> 01:09:57,906
To storm the barricades and take a stand

901
01:10:00,826 --> 01:10:03,954
Or hold my ground

902
01:10:04,830 --> 01:10:07,958
You'll never see any scars or wounds

903
01:10:09,835 --> 01:10:12,753
I don't walk on coals

904
01:10:12,754 --> 01:10:15,882
I won't walk on water

905
01:10:16,842 --> 01:10:19,802
I am no prince

906
01:10:19,803 --> 01:10:22,722
I am no saint

907
01:10:22,723 --> 01:10:25,851
I am not anyone's wildest dream

908
01:10:28,395 --> 01:10:31,523
But I will stand behind

909
01:10:32,441 --> 01:10:35,569
And be someone to fall back on

910
01:10:45,287 --> 01:10:48,415
That's the song.

911
01:10:57,341 --> 01:10:59,800
Some comedy

912
01:10:59,801 --> 01:11:01,719
You're bruised and beaten down

913
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:04,848
And I am the one who's looking for a favor

914
01:11:06,975 --> 01:11:09,435
Still, honestly

915
01:11:09,436 --> 01:11:12,564
You don't believe me
But the things I have

916
01:11:13,231 --> 01:11:16,360
Are the things you need

917
01:11:16,818 --> 01:11:19,947
You look at me like I don't make sense

918
01:11:20,781 --> 01:11:23,909
Like a waste of time
Like it serves no purpose

919
01:11:26,286 --> 01:11:29,414
I am no prince
I am no saint

920
01:11:31,166 --> 01:11:34,294
And if that's what you believe you need

921
01:11:36,046 --> 01:11:39,174
You're wrong
You don't need much

922
01:11:39,549 --> 01:11:42,678
You need someone to fall back on

923
01:11:45,555 --> 01:11:48,684
And I'll be that
I'll take your side

924
01:11:50,268 --> 01:11:53,397
If I'm the only one

925
01:11:53,730 --> 01:11:56,858
I'm used to that

926
01:11:57,567 --> 01:11:59,944
I've been alone

927
01:11:59,945 --> 01:12:03,073
I'd rather be

928
01:12:04,700 --> 01:12:07,368
The half of us

929
01:12:07,369 --> 01:12:09,662
The least of you

930
01:12:09,663 --> 01:12:12,791
The best of me

931
01:12:14,459 --> 01:12:16,877
And I will be

932
01:12:16,878 --> 01:12:20,007
I'll be your prince
I'll be your saint

933
01:12:21,633 --> 01:12:24,761
I will go crashing through fences
in your name

934
01:12:27,639 --> 01:12:30,016
I will, I swear

935
01:12:30,017 --> 01:12:33,145
I'll be someone to fall back on

936
01:12:34,563 --> 01:12:37,691
I'll be the one who waits

937
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:41,528
And for as long as you let me

938
01:12:42,321 --> 01:12:45,449
I will be the one you need

939
01:12:46,992 --> 01:12:50,120
I'll be someone to fall back on

940
01:13:04,343 --> 01:13:07,471
Someone to fall back on

941
01:13:15,270 --> 01:13:18,398
One to fall back on

942
01:13:29,451 --> 01:13:32,579
Dear David Bowie,

943
01:13:33,413 --> 01:13:36,541
just when it looked like things
might be okay,

944
01:13:37,626 --> 01:13:39,001
disaster struck.

945
01:13:39,002 --> 01:13:41,754
What's going on? Where is everybody?

946
01:13:41,755 --> 01:13:44,883
- Art class is cancelled today.
- Why? What happened?

947
01:13:47,135 --> 01:13:50,263
Charlotte's father passed away.

948
01:13:51,682 --> 01:13:54,642
I assumed you knew.

949
01:13:54,643 --> 01:13:57,771
No.

950
01:14:09,700 --> 01:14:12,828
This was a mistake. We shouldn't be here.

951
01:14:13,370 --> 01:14:16,498
She didn't return any of my calls.

952
01:14:18,792 --> 01:14:21,085
- You going to be okay?
- Yeah.

953
01:14:21,086 --> 01:14:23,838
Okay.

954
01:14:23,839 --> 01:14:26,967
Go, she's your friend. She needs you.

955
01:14:36,268 --> 01:14:39,396
Boys...
- I got them.

956
01:14:49,239 --> 01:14:52,367
Charlotte?

957
01:14:53,744 --> 01:14:56,872
I'm sorry.

958
01:14:59,499 --> 01:15:01,000
I called.

959
01:15:01,001 --> 01:15:04,129
I don't know if you got any of my messages.

960
01:15:06,131 --> 01:15:09,259
Yeah, I got them. Thanks.

961
01:15:10,677 --> 01:15:13,804
I wish you would've called me back.

962
01:15:13,805 --> 01:15:15,306
Why?

963
01:15:15,307 --> 01:15:16,807
"Why?"

964
01:15:16,808 --> 01:15:19,560
I don't know. I mean, you told Ben.

965
01:15:19,561 --> 01:15:22,313
So?

966
01:15:22,314 --> 01:15:23,481
Is anything wrong?

967
01:15:23,482 --> 01:15:25,024
Yeah.

968
01:15:25,025 --> 01:15:26,317
Yeah, my dad died.

969
01:15:26,318 --> 01:15:27,943
No, I know.

970
01:15:27,945 --> 01:15:31,073
I wish I could've met him.
I'm sure he was a great man.

971
01:15:33,992 --> 01:15:37,120
He was.

972
01:15:37,788 --> 01:15:40,916
I got to do this.

973
01:15:42,501 --> 01:15:48,048
Charlotte.

974
01:15:48,548 --> 01:15:50,341
- What do you want, Will?
- What do I want?

975
01:15:50,342 --> 01:15:52,259
I just want you to know that I'm here
for you.

976
01:15:52,260 --> 01:15:54,095
Okay, got it. What else?

977
01:15:54,096 --> 01:15:57,139
And not to worry about the daycare.
I can handle that until you come back.

978
01:15:57,140 --> 01:15:58,265
That's it.

979
01:15:58,266 --> 01:15:59,308
Listen, I'm sorry, okay.

980
01:15:59,309 --> 01:16:01,811
It's just a lot to deal with right now,
and I sort of want to be alone.

981
01:16:01,812 --> 01:16:03,104
Okay. I get it, yeah.

982
01:16:03,105 --> 01:16:04,313
And look, about the band...

983
01:16:04,314 --> 01:16:07,442
Don't even worry about the band, okay?
We'll use Phil's Song for Bandslam.

984
01:16:09,111 --> 01:16:11,904
Or not. We don't have to use Phil's Song.
We can find another song, or...

985
01:16:11,905 --> 01:16:15,033
Hey, go ahead. Knock yourselves out.

986
01:16:18,996 --> 01:16:22,124
I mean, it's a beautiful song, Charlotte.

987
01:16:22,374 --> 01:16:24,834
It would make your dad proud.
It would be like he's there.

988
01:16:24,835 --> 01:16:27,878
Stop! Please, just stop!

989
01:16:27,879 --> 01:16:29,839
There is no us, Will. I'm not in the band.

990
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:32,968
What? No, no, no.
Okay, we'll find another song...

991
01:16:33,260 --> 01:16:36,220
It's not about the song. I quit. I just quit.

992
01:16:36,221 --> 01:16:37,680
- Why?
- I don't do "why"!

993
01:16:37,681 --> 01:16:40,809
No, you have to. You just have to!

994
01:16:47,774 --> 01:16:50,902
Please.

995
01:16:56,199 --> 01:16:58,701
You really want to know why?

996
01:16:58,702 --> 01:17:01,830
Last summer, when my dad got sick,

997
01:17:03,415 --> 01:17:06,543
I promised God, the universe,

998
01:17:08,795 --> 01:17:11,422
anyone who'd listen,

999
01:17:11,423 --> 01:17:13,716
that I'd be different.

1000
01:17:13,717 --> 01:17:16,845
Better. Nicer.

1001
01:17:18,347 --> 01:17:21,475
My dad hated the way I acted
when I was with Ben.

1002
01:17:22,100 --> 01:17:25,228
The way I treated kids who weren't popular.

1003
01:17:25,479 --> 01:17:28,230
So, I changed.

1004
01:17:28,231 --> 01:17:31,360
I started volunteering with the monsters.
I left my friends. I left my band.

1005
01:17:33,612 --> 01:17:36,740
I left everything that set me apart
from people like...

1006
01:17:38,325 --> 01:17:41,453
Me.

1007
01:17:43,330 --> 01:17:46,458
People like me.

1008
01:17:48,001 --> 01:17:50,961
So we were just this

1009
01:17:50,963 --> 01:17:53,923
experiment to try and make your dad okay?

1010
01:17:53,924 --> 01:17:55,883
No, I know how crazy this must sound...

1011
01:17:55,884 --> 01:17:58,969
Honestly, Charlotte,
the thing that never made sense

1012
01:17:58,971 --> 01:18:02,099
was you being my friend in the first place.

1013
01:18:05,143 --> 01:18:08,271
Hey!
While you're up there on your high horse,

1014
01:18:08,563 --> 01:18:11,692
ask yourself who are you
to judge me about lying?

1015
01:18:12,067 --> 01:18:15,195
Dewey!

1016
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:22,618
That stands for DWI, right?

1017
01:18:22,619 --> 01:18:25,747
Driving while intoxicated?

1018
01:18:26,873 --> 01:18:30,002
I don't know what's worse.

1019
01:18:31,211 --> 01:18:34,339
Losing a father you love so much
you change your whole life for him,

1020
01:18:39,928 --> 01:18:43,056
or having a father you're so ashamed of,
you make up a whole life for him.

1021
01:19:20,677 --> 01:19:23,512
Can I have some beef jerky?

1022
01:19:23,513 --> 01:19:26,642
Is he kidding?

1023
01:19:28,477 --> 01:19:31,605
You warned me about her.

1024
01:19:31,688 --> 01:19:33,481
I didn't listen.

1025
01:19:33,482 --> 01:19:36,610
She can't help it.
It's how girls like that are hardwired.

1026
01:19:39,821 --> 01:19:42,950
How are we hardwired?

1027
01:19:43,158 --> 01:19:46,286
I mean, sure, right now, I am just a kid.

1028
01:19:48,246 --> 01:19:51,375
Whatever.

1029
01:19:52,376 --> 01:19:55,378
What's going to change?

1030
01:19:55,379 --> 01:19:57,672
Nothing.

1031
01:19:57,673 --> 01:20:00,383
I'm just going to be

1032
01:20:00,384 --> 01:20:03,512
unhappy,

1033
01:20:04,513 --> 01:20:06,389
alone,

1034
01:20:06,390 --> 01:20:09,518
scared of, like, everything.

1035
01:20:13,480 --> 01:20:16,608
You're not alone, Will.

1036
01:20:24,241 --> 01:20:27,369
Experiment? We were just her experiment?

1037
01:20:28,245 --> 01:20:30,204
I keep thinking...

1038
01:20:30,205 --> 01:20:31,580
What?

1039
01:20:31,581 --> 01:20:34,710
Well, if you were just part of
Charlotte's experiment this whole time,

1040
01:20:35,919 --> 01:20:38,462
then, what is reality?

1041
01:20:38,463 --> 01:20:40,548
What if Charlotte and her experiment are

1042
01:20:40,549 --> 01:20:43,677
really a part of someone else's
larger experiment?

1043
01:20:44,094 --> 01:20:47,222
I mean, what if we're being manipulated
by some greater intelligence than our own?

1044
01:20:48,932 --> 01:20:52,060
And if so, is there really such a thing
as free will?

1045
01:20:54,604 --> 01:20:56,022
Am I moving my hand,

1046
01:20:56,023 --> 01:20:59,151
or was it predetermined by a force
I'm not even aware of?

1047
01:21:00,277 --> 01:21:03,405
Charlotte times a trillion.

1048
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:14,707
See, this is why you don't have friends!

1049
01:21:14,708 --> 01:21:17,836
All right, this is ridiculous! She doesn't
get to make our whole lives a lie!

1050
01:21:18,170 --> 01:21:21,298
I mean, it was real for me.
Wasn't it real for you?

1051
01:21:23,300 --> 01:21:25,801
I say we refuse to let Charlotte
screw this up for us.

1052
01:21:25,802 --> 01:21:28,930
I mean, we've worked too hard.

1053
01:21:29,973 --> 01:21:32,266
We're doing Bandslam.

1054
01:21:32,267 --> 01:21:33,476
You're crazy.
Why?

1055
01:21:33,477 --> 01:21:36,020
How long have you got?

1056
01:21:36,021 --> 01:21:38,939
It won't work.
What song are we going to do?

1057
01:21:38,940 --> 01:21:40,524
Phil's Song. She said we could.

1058
01:21:40,525 --> 01:21:43,654
Oh, yeah? And who's going to sing it?

1059
01:22:29,908 --> 01:22:33,036
You say your patience is longer
than my face

1060
01:22:35,747 --> 01:22:38,875
Oh, yeah, but I can see right through
your plastic case

1061
01:22:41,295 --> 01:22:44,423
Oh, you're running round
like your life is some type of race

1062
01:22:47,301 --> 01:22:50,429
You know I'm trying
but I cannot keep your pace

1063
01:22:52,097 --> 01:22:55,225
Oh, so take your blizzard
somewhere else, little girl

1064
01:22:55,434 --> 01:22:58,562
Your stormy weather ain't welcome here

1065
01:22:58,854 --> 01:23:01,564
I Can't Go On, I'll Go On.

1066
01:23:01,565 --> 01:23:04,693
Can't not buy it, buy it.

1067
01:23:08,113 --> 01:23:11,241
- Hey.
- Hey.

1068
01:23:11,742 --> 01:23:14,618
How are the guys holding up?
Have you been backstage?

1069
01:23:14,619 --> 01:23:17,748
Yeah, they're fine. Actually, they're great.

1070
01:23:17,831 --> 01:23:20,959
Think I'll go and wish them luck.

1071
01:23:21,209 --> 01:23:24,338
Okay.

1072
01:23:30,469 --> 01:23:33,597
Hey! Dennis Ardmore.

1073
01:23:33,680 --> 01:23:34,722
What?

1074
01:23:34,723 --> 01:23:37,851
Dennis Ardmore.
Does that name ring a bell?

1075
01:23:38,143 --> 01:23:40,061
No. Should it?

1076
01:23:40,062 --> 01:23:43,190
I guess not. I just didn't know how much
research you all had done, so...

1077
01:23:44,608 --> 01:23:47,151
But he would've been about your age now.

1078
01:23:47,152 --> 01:23:50,280
Except that Will's father got drunk in
the middle of the afternoon,

1079
01:23:50,364 --> 01:23:52,073
like he did every afternoon,

1080
01:23:52,074 --> 01:23:55,202
and ran him over while he was walking
home from school.

1081
01:23:57,204 --> 01:23:58,287
I heard. I'm sorry.

1082
01:23:58,288 --> 01:24:01,416
Yeah. Did you hear that Will insisted
that I bring him to the funeral?

1083
01:24:02,501 --> 01:24:04,585
That's what kind of kid he is.

1084
01:24:04,586 --> 01:24:07,714
Twelve years old, he walks right up to
Dennis Ardmore's parents,

1085
01:24:08,966 --> 01:24:12,094
and asked their forgiveness.

1086
01:24:18,350 --> 01:24:20,434
Everyone hated Will's dad.

1087
01:24:20,435 --> 01:24:22,853
Well, who wouldn't? I mean...

1088
01:24:22,854 --> 01:24:25,983
And then they put him away, and it's
like they just turned it all on his kid.

1089
01:24:27,609 --> 01:24:30,486
It was awful.

1090
01:24:30,487 --> 01:24:31,904
So just give him a break.

1091
01:24:31,905 --> 01:24:35,033
Please? Not a lot of people have.

1092
01:24:35,450 --> 01:24:38,578
So I don't know what you were planning
on saying to him, or doing, but just don't.

1093
01:24:41,206 --> 01:24:42,748
Just don't. Okay?

1094
01:24:42,749 --> 01:24:45,877
Don't make up with him. Don't be his friend.

1095
01:24:47,421 --> 01:24:48,546
Why not?

1096
01:24:48,547 --> 01:24:51,675
Because, I don't think he'll recover
if you leave him twice.

1097
01:24:55,846 --> 01:24:58,514
I've never met a kid like Will.

1098
01:24:58,515 --> 01:25:00,599
My friends have never met a kid like Will.

1099
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:03,729
The monsters have never met a kid like Will.

1100
01:25:03,895 --> 01:25:07,024
And I want you to let me apologize to him
because I want to keep knowing him.

1101
01:25:07,858 --> 01:25:10,609
You know, I like who I am
when I'm with Will.

1102
01:25:10,610 --> 01:25:13,739
And I will do anything in the world
to be that person again.

1103
01:25:17,826 --> 01:25:20,954
So, please,

1104
01:25:22,331 --> 01:25:25,459
don't ask me not to.

1105
01:25:30,964 --> 01:25:33,174
Okay.

1106
01:25:33,175 --> 01:25:36,218
Thank you.

1107
01:25:36,219 --> 01:25:37,887
I said, "Okay. " I'm not going to hug you.

1108
01:25:37,888 --> 01:25:39,722
Okay.

1109
01:25:39,723 --> 01:25:42,183
And by the way,
I'm really glad you don't wear

1110
01:25:42,184 --> 01:25:44,643
those little groupie outfits
all the time, Karen.

1111
01:25:44,645 --> 01:25:47,773
You'll need this.

1112
01:25:50,609 --> 01:25:52,651
All right.

1113
01:25:52,653 --> 01:25:55,781
And I'm so sorry about your father.

1114
01:26:14,716 --> 01:26:17,844
Tax and total it for me

1115
01:26:21,890 --> 01:26:25,018
I'll pay my bill and run so fast

1116
01:26:30,941 --> 01:26:34,069
Separation is our love now

1117
01:26:36,238 --> 01:26:38,906
Well, we're toast.

1118
01:26:38,907 --> 01:26:42,035
I don't know. They're okay.

1119
01:26:42,285 --> 01:26:43,577
I hear the band to watch

1120
01:26:43,578 --> 01:26:46,707
is I Can't Drive Stick, I'll Drive Stick,
or something like that.

1121
01:26:53,088 --> 01:26:56,216
Look, let me just speak.

1122
01:26:56,425 --> 01:26:59,553
The whole experiment thing,
not my finest hour.

1123
01:27:01,722 --> 01:27:04,850
I was angry and stupid
and really, really confused.

1124
01:27:08,103 --> 01:27:11,231
And I'm sorry.

1125
01:27:13,984 --> 01:27:15,776
Are you kidding me?

1126
01:27:15,777 --> 01:27:17,486
Okay, quick recap.

1127
01:27:17,487 --> 01:27:20,448
Charlotte dumps Ben,
turns you guys into a band,

1128
01:27:20,449 --> 01:27:22,783
finds the genius that is Will,

1129
01:27:22,784 --> 01:27:25,912
then, does one stupid thing

1130
01:27:26,330 --> 01:27:28,456
because her father has died,

1131
01:27:28,457 --> 01:27:31,585
realizes, and comes to apologize.

1132
01:27:32,794 --> 01:27:35,922
And you're not going to
accept the apology?

1133
01:27:37,466 --> 01:27:40,594
Plus, I really miss you guys.

1134
01:27:43,305 --> 01:27:45,890
Is that real?

1135
01:27:45,891 --> 01:27:48,351
Hundred percent.

1136
01:27:48,352 --> 01:27:51,480
The only thing that matters is seeing
you guys kick some serious butt tonight.

1137
01:27:54,650 --> 01:27:57,735
And you're singing Phil's Song.

1138
01:27:57,736 --> 01:28:00,864
- Is that okay?
- Yeah. Of course.

1139
01:28:01,907 --> 01:28:05,035
And I'll be the girl in front,
screaming my head off while you do.

1140
01:28:19,466 --> 01:28:21,759
Keep it hot like steam, that's your dream

1141
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:23,678
Baby, get up off me

1142
01:28:23,679 --> 01:28:26,807
It's so clean, the way I've been
Gots me looking glossy

1143
01:28:27,182 --> 01:28:30,310
On the scene with the queen
That be acting bossy

1144
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:33,689
I don't want no drama, little mama
So please get up off me

1145
01:28:34,815 --> 01:28:37,943
Yeah, you know how I blow
Till you're feeling dizzy

1146
01:28:38,193 --> 01:28:41,321
Lots of soul, that's the goal

1147
01:28:42,280 --> 01:28:44,782
Yeah, go ahead. Copy that.

1148
01:28:44,783 --> 01:28:46,826
Way to be impartial.

1149
01:28:46,827 --> 01:28:49,955
Way to be realistic about your chances.

1150
01:28:50,038 --> 01:28:52,331
Way to say "way" just because I did.

1151
01:28:52,332 --> 01:28:55,460
Yeah. Standing by. Follow spots.

1152
01:28:55,752 --> 01:28:58,880
And now, from Martin Van Buren
High School in Lodi, New Jersey,

1153
01:29:00,549 --> 01:29:03,677
Ben Wheatly and the Glory Dogs!

1154
01:29:07,139 --> 01:29:10,267
You're number one!

1155
01:29:13,854 --> 01:29:16,982
Thank you.

1156
01:29:19,151 --> 01:29:22,279
Thank you so much.

1157
01:29:22,571 --> 01:29:25,699
I'd like to dedicate this next song
to someone very special to me.

1158
01:29:28,952 --> 01:29:30,870
She taught me a lot,

1159
01:29:30,871 --> 01:29:33,581
and she wrote this song.

1160
01:29:33,582 --> 01:29:36,710
So, Charlotte, this one's for you.

1161
01:29:41,256 --> 01:29:43,632
I'll never be

1162
01:29:43,634 --> 01:29:46,762
A knight in armor with a sword in hand

1163
01:29:47,804 --> 01:29:50,932
Whoa, whoa! No, no, no!

1164
01:29:51,058 --> 01:29:53,267
Don't count on me

1165
01:29:53,268 --> 01:29:56,396
To storm the barricades and take a stand

1166
01:29:57,022 --> 01:29:59,440
I didn't know. I swear. I didn't know.

1167
01:29:59,441 --> 01:30:00,941
- No, no, no.
- What?

1168
01:30:00,942 --> 01:30:03,194
You'll never see

1169
01:30:03,195 --> 01:30:06,323
It's old. Ben knew it. He probably thought
he was doing something nice for me.

1170
01:30:07,115 --> 01:30:09,992
I had no idea, Karen.
You've got to believe me!

1171
01:30:09,993 --> 01:30:11,911
I am no prince

1172
01:30:11,912 --> 01:30:13,662
I am no saint

1173
01:30:13,664 --> 01:30:16,792
I am not anyone's wildest dream

1174
01:30:16,833 --> 01:30:19,502
What are we going to do?
We can't sing the same song.

1175
01:30:19,503 --> 01:30:22,546
I don't know anything else.

1176
01:30:22,547 --> 01:30:23,714
Yes, you do.

1177
01:30:23,715 --> 01:30:26,843
And it's famous and only has, like,
four chords.

1178
01:30:27,094 --> 01:30:28,594
Alley. Now!

1179
01:30:28,595 --> 01:30:31,723
Someone to fall back on

1180
01:30:51,284 --> 01:30:54,413
Someone to fall back on

1181
01:31:13,932 --> 01:31:15,349
Come on!

1182
01:31:15,350 --> 01:31:16,559
We need another minute.

1183
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:17,810
We don't have another minute! They just...

1184
01:31:17,811 --> 01:31:20,939
We need another minute!

1185
01:31:26,278 --> 01:31:29,406
Our last band is also from
Martin Van Buren High.

1186
01:31:30,157 --> 01:31:32,616
I don't know what they're putting
in the water in Lodi,

1187
01:31:32,617 --> 01:31:35,746
but give it up for I Can't Go On, I'll Go On!

1188
01:31:40,792 --> 01:31:43,878
That's us! Come on!

1189
01:31:43,879 --> 01:31:45,296
What's going on?

1190
01:31:45,297 --> 01:31:47,089
Get on stage.

1191
01:31:47,090 --> 01:31:49,550
- Where?
- On stage!

1192
01:31:49,551 --> 01:31:52,428
- Why? No! What am I going to do?
- You're going to stall!

1193
01:31:52,429 --> 01:31:55,557
- They hate me.
- Go!

1194
01:32:12,574 --> 01:32:15,702
Say something, for God's sake,
say something.

1195
01:32:20,332 --> 01:32:23,460
Dewey!

1196
01:32:25,796 --> 01:32:27,046
Dewey!

1197
01:32:27,047 --> 01:32:28,506
Oh, my God!

1198
01:32:30,300 --> 01:32:33,302
Dewey!

1199
01:32:33,303 --> 01:32:35,346
Where's the band?

1200
01:32:35,347 --> 01:32:36,806
Dewey!

1201
01:32:36,807 --> 01:32:38,099
Dewey.

1202
01:32:38,100 --> 01:32:41,228
Dewey!

1203
01:32:41,561 --> 01:32:44,690
Dewey!

1204
01:32:51,697 --> 01:32:54,825
Dewey! Dewey! Dewey!

1205
01:33:36,658 --> 01:33:39,786
Dewey. Dewey. Dewey.

1206
01:33:45,876 --> 01:33:48,335
Dewey. Come on! Dewey.

1207
01:33:48,337 --> 01:33:51,465
Dewey. Dewey. Dewey.

1208
01:33:52,132 --> 01:33:54,008
Dewey... Yeah, come on!

1209
01:33:54,009 --> 01:33:56,969
Dewey! Dewey! Dewey!

1210
01:33:56,970 --> 01:34:00,098
Do we want to rock?

1211
01:34:03,352 --> 01:34:05,394
Wake up, New Jersey!

1212
01:34:05,395 --> 01:34:08,523
I said, do we want to rock?

1213
01:34:17,616 --> 01:34:20,159
Because I have seen the future

1214
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:21,827
and their name is,

1215
01:34:21,828 --> 01:34:24,956
I Can't Go On, I'll Go On!

1216
01:35:19,177 --> 01:35:22,304
You shelter me from harm

1217
01:35:22,305 --> 01:35:24,724
You kept me warm

1218
01:35:24,725 --> 01:35:27,853
Kept me warm

1219
01:35:28,437 --> 01:35:31,564
You gave my life to me

1220
01:35:31,565 --> 01:35:36,987
Set me free

1221
01:35:37,154 --> 01:35:40,282
The finest years I ever knew

1222
01:35:41,658 --> 01:35:44,452
All the years I had with you

1223
01:35:44,453 --> 01:35:47,581
And I would give everything I own

1224
01:35:48,332 --> 01:35:49,457
One time

1225
01:35:49,458 --> 01:35:52,586
Give up my life, my heart, my home

1226
01:35:53,003 --> 01:35:54,086
Two times

1227
01:35:54,087 --> 01:35:57,215
I would give everything I own

1228
01:35:58,967 --> 01:36:02,095
Just to have you once again

1229
01:36:15,400 --> 01:36:18,527
You taught me how to love

1230
01:36:18,528 --> 01:36:23,825
What it's of

1231
01:36:23,867 --> 01:36:26,995
You never said too much
But still you showed the way

1232
01:36:27,746 --> 01:36:30,874
And I knew from watching you

1233
01:36:33,168 --> 01:36:36,296
Nobody else could ever know

1234
01:36:37,631 --> 01:36:40,424
The part of me that can't let go

1235
01:36:40,425 --> 01:36:43,553
And I would give everything I own

1236
01:36:45,222 --> 01:36:48,350
Give up my life, my heart, my home

1237
01:36:49,601 --> 01:36:52,729
I would give everything I own

1238
01:36:55,023 --> 01:36:58,151
Just to have you once again

1239
01:36:59,486 --> 01:37:02,614
Just to have you once again

1240
01:37:06,201 --> 01:37:09,161
Is there someone you know

1241
01:37:09,162 --> 01:37:11,539
You're loving them so

1242
01:37:11,540 --> 01:37:14,668
But taking them all for granted

1243
01:37:16,378 --> 01:37:18,546
You may lose them one day

1244
01:37:18,547 --> 01:37:21,132
Someone takes them away

1245
01:37:21,133 --> 01:37:24,261
And they don't hear the words
you long to say

1246
01:37:28,682 --> 01:37:31,810
I would give everything I own

1247
01:37:33,186 --> 01:37:36,315
Give up my life, my heart, my home

1248
01:37:38,025 --> 01:37:41,153
I would give anything I own

1249
01:37:42,946 --> 01:37:46,032
Just to have you

1250
01:37:46,033 --> 01:37:48,242
I gotta have you

1251
01:37:48,243 --> 01:37:51,162
I would give everything I own

1252
01:37:51,163 --> 01:37:52,830
Everything I own

1253
01:37:52,831 --> 01:37:55,959
Give up my life, my heart, my home

1254
01:37:56,001 --> 01:37:59,129
I would give everything I own

1255
01:37:59,838 --> 01:38:02,423
Everything, everything I own

1256
01:38:02,424 --> 01:38:05,552
- Just to have you
- Just to have you

1257
01:38:05,635 --> 01:38:08,764
I would give everything I own

1258
01:38:10,098 --> 01:38:13,226
Give up my life, my heart, my home

1259
01:38:14,645 --> 01:38:17,773
I would give everything I own

1260
01:38:19,232 --> 01:38:22,361
Give up my life, my heart, my home

1261
01:38:23,737 --> 01:38:26,865
I would give

1262
01:38:49,680 --> 01:38:52,808
Everything, everything I own
Everything, everything I own

1263
01:38:53,517 --> 01:38:56,645
Everything, everything I own
Everything, everything I

1264
01:39:05,362 --> 01:39:08,490
Own

1265
01:40:10,635 --> 01:40:13,764
Dude! That was sick!

1266
01:40:15,015 --> 01:40:18,143
The whole thing with Ben singing
the song, I swear, I didn't know.

1267
01:40:18,643 --> 01:40:20,311
I know. I know.

1268
01:40:20,312 --> 01:40:23,440
That... They were ridiculously good!

1269
01:40:23,482 --> 01:40:25,566
Who are you? You are...

1270
01:40:25,567 --> 01:40:28,235
- Mom.
- Where do you come from?

1271
01:40:28,236 --> 01:40:31,365
Cute lead singer I hope to make
my girlfriend is actually laughing at me.

1272
01:40:33,200 --> 01:40:36,328
All right. Fine.

1273
01:40:42,834 --> 01:40:45,962
It's time to leave.

1274
01:40:54,805 --> 01:40:57,933
And the winner of this year's Bandslam is...

1275
01:41:12,239 --> 01:41:15,367
From Greenwich High School in
Greenwich, Connecticut, The Daze!

1276
01:41:40,934 --> 01:41:41,976
Over here, please.

1277
01:41:41,977 --> 01:41:43,686
Can we get a smiley one right here?

1278
01:41:43,687 --> 01:41:46,815
One more.
$10,000.

1279
01:41:47,858 --> 01:41:50,776
The part of me that can't let go

1280
01:41:50,777 --> 01:41:53,905
Forget The Daze,
these guys rocked harder than anybody.

1281
01:41:54,156 --> 01:41:55,614
You should post it.

1282
01:41:55,615 --> 01:41:58,744
Give up my life,
my heart, my home

1283
01:42:04,249 --> 01:42:07,377
If you feel like singing a song

1284
01:42:07,961 --> 01:42:11,089
And you want other people to sing along

1285
01:42:12,174 --> 01:42:15,302
Then just sing what you feel

1286
01:42:16,136 --> 01:42:19,264
Don't let anyone say it's wrong

1287
01:42:22,142 --> 01:42:25,270
And if you're trying to paint a picture

1288
01:42:25,937 --> 01:42:29,066
But you're not sure which colors belong

1289
01:42:30,359 --> 01:42:33,487
Just paint what you see

1290
01:42:34,363 --> 01:42:36,197
Don't let anyone say it's wrong

1291
01:42:36,198 --> 01:42:37,740
Hey!

1292
01:42:37,741 --> 01:42:40,076
Kyra17-1, what's up?

1293
01:42:40,077 --> 01:42:43,205
I told you, the dash is silent.

1294
01:42:45,499 --> 01:42:48,627
Or stung awake in the night

1295
01:42:49,753 --> 01:42:52,880
It's all right to be frightened

1296
01:42:52,881 --> 01:42:55,132
When there's a light

1297
01:42:55,133 --> 01:42:57,176
What light?

1298
01:42:57,177 --> 01:42:59,178
There's a light

1299
01:42:59,179 --> 01:43:01,222
What light?

1300
01:43:01,223 --> 01:43:03,391
There's a light

1301
01:43:03,392 --> 01:43:05,434
White light

1302
01:43:05,435 --> 01:43:07,436
There's a light

1303
01:43:07,437 --> 01:43:09,355
White light

1304
01:43:09,356 --> 01:43:11,565
Well, there's a light

1305
01:43:11,566 --> 01:43:13,609
One light

1306
01:43:13,610 --> 01:43:15,736
There's a light

1307
01:43:15,737 --> 01:43:17,738
White light

1308
01:43:17,739 --> 01:43:18,906
And there's a light

1309
01:43:18,907 --> 01:43:20,783
Dear Will Burton,

1310
01:43:20,784 --> 01:43:22,952
it says on your MySpace page

1311
01:43:22,953 --> 01:43:26,081
that you manage I Can't Go On, I'll Go On.

1312
01:43:26,540 --> 01:43:27,998
Nice name.

1313
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:29,917
I really like your band.

1314
01:43:29,918 --> 01:43:33,046
You know, I'm starting an indie label.

1315
01:43:34,297 --> 01:43:35,923
Are you signed to anyone?

1316
01:43:35,924 --> 01:43:39,052
Maybe we can sit down and have a chat.

1317
01:43:41,138 --> 01:43:42,596
Oh, my God!

1318
01:43:47,728 --> 01:43:49,687
All the best.

1319
01:43:49,688 --> 01:43:52,440
David Bowie.

1320
01:43:52,441 --> 01:43:54,442
White light

1321
01:43:54,443 --> 01:43:56,360
Well, there's a light

1322
01:43:56,361 --> 01:43:58,404
White light

1323
01:43:58,405 --> 01:44:00,489
There's a light

1324
01:44:00,490 --> 01:44:02,658
White light

1325
01:44:02,659 --> 01:44:04,785
There's a light

1326
01:44:04,786 --> 01:44:06,829
White light

1327
01:44:06,830 --> 01:44:08,622
There's a light

1328
01:44:08,623 --> 01:44:10,833
- Hey.
- Hey.

1329
01:44:10,834 --> 01:44:13,962
Smile.

1330
01:44:17,507 --> 01:44:19,133
- Hey.
- Hey.

1331
01:44:19,134 --> 01:44:21,385
- You look great.
- Thanks.

1332
01:44:21,386 --> 01:44:24,514
It's my new makeup,
"I Can't Wear Blush, I'll Wear Blush. "

1333
01:44:27,476 --> 01:44:30,144
Hey, you got room for one more?
No!

1334
01:44:30,145 --> 01:44:31,228
Shotgun.
No way.

1335
01:44:31,229 --> 01:44:34,358
I called shotgun like an hour ago.

1336
01:45:11,728 --> 01:45:14,855
Don't it blow your mind?

1337
01:45:14,856 --> 01:45:17,984
Don't it blow your mind like the first time?

1338
01:45:18,443 --> 01:45:21,571
Circle of voices
in a crowded room

1339
01:45:24,908 --> 01:45:28,036
Plays in my head
so out of time

1340
01:45:31,123 --> 01:45:34,251
Kill me with kindness
never enough I find

1341
01:45:37,129 --> 01:45:40,257
Don't it blow your mind?

1342
01:45:40,340 --> 01:45:43,426
Don't it blow your mind again?

1343
01:45:43,427 --> 01:45:46,555
Don't it blow your mind for the third time?

1344
01:45:47,848 --> 01:45:50,976
The dream is never over

1345
01:45:54,062 --> 01:45:57,190
The dream is never over

1346
01:45:59,651 --> 01:46:02,779
Envision a future still in black and white

1347
01:46:06,074 --> 01:46:09,202
Colors of youth run into gold

1348
01:46:12,331 --> 01:46:15,459
Blue is for sorrow,
red is for sadder light

1349
01:46:18,337 --> 01:46:21,465
Don't it blow your mind?

1350
01:46:21,506 --> 01:46:24,634
Don't it blow your mind again?

1351
01:46:24,676 --> 01:46:27,804
Don't it blow your mind for the third time?

1352
01:46:28,889 --> 01:46:32,017
The dream is never over

1353
01:46:35,145 --> 01:46:38,273
The dream is never over

1354
01:47:02,631 --> 01:47:05,383
To my favorite teacher

1355
01:47:05,384 --> 01:47:07,551
Told me never give up

1356
01:47:07,552 --> 01:47:10,012
To my fifth grade crush

1357
01:47:10,013 --> 01:47:12,390
Who I thought I really loved

1358
01:47:12,391 --> 01:47:15,519
To the guys I miss
and the girls we kissed

1359
01:47:17,187 --> 01:47:20,315
Where are you now?

1360
01:47:22,109 --> 01:47:24,485
To my ex-best friends

1361
01:47:24,486 --> 01:47:26,904
Don't know how we grew apart

1362
01:47:26,905 --> 01:47:29,365
To my favorite band

1363
01:47:29,366 --> 01:47:31,784
And sing-alongs in my car

1364
01:47:31,785 --> 01:47:34,913
To the face I see
in my memories

1365
01:47:36,623 --> 01:47:39,751
Where are you now?

1366
01:47:41,461 --> 01:47:43,879
Where are you now?

1367
01:47:43,880 --> 01:47:46,340
'Cause I'm thinking of you

1368
01:47:46,341 --> 01:47:48,676
You showed me how

1369
01:47:48,677 --> 01:47:51,137
How to live like I do

1370
01:47:51,138 --> 01:47:53,514
If it wasn't for you

1371
01:47:53,515 --> 01:47:56,643
I would never be who I am

1372
01:48:00,856 --> 01:48:03,399
To my first girlfriend

1373
01:48:03,400 --> 01:48:05,776
I thought for sure
was the one

1374
01:48:05,777 --> 01:48:08,154
To my last girlfriend

1375
01:48:08,155 --> 01:48:10,656
Sorry that I screwed it up

1376
01:48:10,657 --> 01:48:13,409
To the ones I loved

1377
01:48:13,410 --> 01:48:15,453
Didn't show it enough

1378
01:48:15,454 --> 01:48:18,582
Where are you now?

1379
01:48:20,334 --> 01:48:22,668
Where are you now?

1380
01:48:22,669 --> 01:48:25,171
'Cause I'm thinking of you

1381
01:48:25,172 --> 01:48:27,548
You showed me how

1382
01:48:27,549 --> 01:48:30,009
How to live like I do

1383
01:48:30,010 --> 01:48:32,511
If it wasn't for you

1384
01:48:32,512 --> 01:48:35,640
I would never be who I am

1385
01:48:38,352 --> 01:48:41,480
I know we'll never see
those days again

1386
01:48:43,273 --> 01:48:46,401
And things will never
be that way again

1387
01:48:47,027 --> 01:48:49,445
But that's just how it goes

1388
01:48:49,446 --> 01:48:51,822
People change but I know

1389
01:48:51,823 --> 01:48:54,951
I won't forget you

1390
01:49:13,679 --> 01:49:16,472
To the ones who cared

1391
01:49:16,473 --> 01:49:18,557
And who were there
from the start

1392
01:49:18,558 --> 01:49:21,102
To the love that left

1393
01:49:21,103 --> 01:49:23,354
And took a piece of my heart

1394
01:49:23,355 --> 01:49:25,981
To the few who'd swear

1395
01:49:25,982 --> 01:49:28,401
They'd never go anywhere

1396
01:49:28,402 --> 01:49:31,530
Where are you now?

1397
01:49:33,156 --> 01:49:35,741
Where are you now?

1398
01:49:35,742 --> 01:49:38,119
'Cause I'm thinking of you

1399
01:49:38,120 --> 01:49:40,413
You showed me how

1400
01:49:40,414 --> 01:49:42,957
How to live like I do

1401
01:49:42,958 --> 01:49:45,418
If it wasn't for you

1402
01:49:45,419 --> 01:49:48,547
I would never be who I am

1403
01:49:52,718 --> 01:49:55,136
If it wasn't for you

1404
01:49:55,137 --> 01:49:58,265
I would never be who I am

1405
01:50:02,352 --> 01:50:04,770
If it wasn't for you

1406
01:50:04,771 --> 01:50:07,481
I'd be nothing
