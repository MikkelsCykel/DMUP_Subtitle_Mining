before he left this shitty world,

69

there are five rules
when shooting a game of pool for cash.

70
00:06:42,217 --> 00:06:44,447
Lesson number one.

71
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:48,052
Always shoot
with a cigarette hangin' in your mouth.

72

Can't smoke with no fire, asshole.

Lesson two.

75

Always know the table before you shoot.

76
00:07:07,617 --> 00:07:09,687
Lesson number three.

77
00:07:10,657 --> 00:07:15,572
Make sure you chalk that stick real good
before each shot.

78

Lesson four.

79

Never make a bet...
if you can't pay the debt.

¶ All the tears inside

157
00:15:08,937 --> 00:15:12,646
¶ What an ache it will bring

158
00:15:14,097 --> 00:15:16,053
God, I love this place.

159
00:15:17,577 --> 00:15:20,694

¶ But what can I tell my heart?

165
00:15:53,497 --> 00:15:56,853
Hey, old man, half-time's over.
You got a restaurant to run.

166
00:15:56,937 --> 00:15:59,974
Man alive, Harley.

167
00:16:00,057 --> 00:16:02,048
So good to see you.

168
00:16:03,657 --> 00:16:06,535
I'm gonna regret it. I always do.

169
00:16:08,617 --> 00:16:11,006
Yeah. Who are the suits?

170
00:16:13,057 --> 00:16:16,493
Go back to wherever it is you ran off to.

171
00:16:16,577 --> 00:16:21,048
I can't do that.
I got some unfinished business.

172
00:16:21,137 --> 00:16:24,846
Some business is better left unfinished.

173
00:16:27,177 --> 00:16:28,496
¶ What an ache

174
00:16:28,577 --> 00:16:31,694
Not this business. I'll see you around.

175
00:16:32,537 --> 00:16:36,291
¶ Then I'll wander home

176
00:16:36,377 --> 00:16:40,165
¶ To a telephone

177
00:16:40,257 --> 00:16:45,012
¶ Oh, that forgot how to ring

178
00:16:45,297 --> 00:16:51,372
¶ I could say you'll soon be back, dear

181

¶ Oh, but what will I tell my heart

182
00:17:15,657 --> 00:17:18,296
You got a death wish?

183
00:17:18,377 --> 00:17:21,130
You better leave that one alone, Harley.

184
00:17:21,217 --> 00:17:23,651
You don't think Jack's still pissed off?

185
00:17:23,737 --> 00:17:26,456
Pissed off at ya? Nah.

186
00:17:28,137 --> 00:17:30,526
He wants to kill ya.

00:17:57,097 --> 00:18:01,409
He didn't think you were comin' back.
Chompin' at the bit for some action.

Me and you are gonna
rock 'n' roll, brother.

Jimmy and... Jack here?

196

Said he doesn't think you should go in.
If you do, you're dead.

197
00:18:19,657 --> 00:18:24,333
It's better to be dead and cool
than alive and uncool.

198
00:18:29,977 --> 00:18:32,491
200 on Jack! Place your bets.

199

200 on Jack.

00:18:40,977 --> 00:18:44,526
Well, goddamn.
Does he look like he's gotten bigger?

201
00:18:44,617 --> 00:18:45,936
Maybe a little.

202
00:18:46,017 --> 00:18:50,488
The book is closed!
It is time for the main event.

203
00:18:50,577 --> 00:18:52,647
Get set, gentlemen.

204
00:18:54,177 --> 00:18:57,249
Now, may I ask one thing back here?

205
00:18:57,337 --> 00:19:01,933
And that is two things. Be fair and be cool.

Come on, Jack! Come on, Jack!

209
00:19:14,577 --> 00:19:16,807

Goddamn!

Harley, what are you doin' back here?

212
00:19:27,857 --> 00:19:31,133
- I missed all you guys.
- I'm gonna kill you, Harley.

213
00:19:31,217 --> 00:19:33,128
- Told you.
- Get ready.

214
00:19:33,217 --> 00:19:36,414
Jack, I don't want to fight with you.
We're friends.

- Can't we talk this out?
- Not a chance.

217
00:19:40,577 --> 00:19:43,614
Talk's cheap. And I'm not buyin' any.

218
00:19:47,097 --> 00:19:50,328
Hey, Jimmy,
you wanna help me out here a little?

219
00:19:50,417 --> 00:19:53,056
This is your world, homes.
I'm just livin' in it.

220
00:19:57,097 --> 00:20:01,648
Hurry up, Harley.
It's gonna be bloody but quick.

221
00:20:01,737 --> 00:20:03,728
You hold on.

222

<i>(Marlboro)</i> How much do you think
we can get for this jacket?

<i>Vaya con Dios, amigo.</i>

Go with God.

227
00:20:26,177 --> 00:20:31,012
Now, Jack, you know the last time
we did this I kicked your ass.

228
00:20:31,097 --> 00:20:35,170
That was in high school, Harley,
and Jack had a broken arm.

229
00:20:35,257 --> 00:20:37,896
I'm the one that did it.

230
00:20:37,977 --> 00:20:39,968
You remember, Jack?

231
00:20:55,737 --> 00:20:56,886
Goddamnit!

232
00:20:58,817 --> 00:21:01,809
He was doin' pretty good up to there.

233
00:21:06,097 --> 00:21:06,973
Oh...

234
00:21:10,057 --> 00:21:12,093
I can't watch this.

235
00:21:16,777 --> 00:21:18,415
Uh-oh.

236
00:21:18,497 --> 00:21:20,488
He's fucked.

237
00:21:23,097 --> 00:21:25,292
I'm gonna kill you, Harley.

238
00:21:35,497 --> 00:21:38,057
I just picked the wrong flower.

239
00:21:38,137 --> 00:21:42,574
I'd kill for you, Harley.
How could you do that to me?

240
00:21:42,657 --> 00:21:46,775
I've always been bad company with
a good-looking woman in the room.

241
00:21:46,857 --> 00:21:49,087
Stay away from her, Harley.

242
00:21:49,177 --> 00:21:51,691
I love her. We're married.

243
00:21:54,297 --> 00:21:57,255
It's always only been you, Jack.

244
00:21:57,337 --> 00:21:59,612
She loves you.

245
00:21:59,697 --> 00:22:02,131
- She does?
- Just you.

246
00:22:02,217 --> 00:22:04,685
- Never you?
- No. Just you.

247
00:22:06,137 --> 00:22:08,605
Sorry, buddy. Sorry.

248
00:22:08,937 --> 00:22:12,771
I should've never let you
in the door, Harley.

249
00:22:12,857 --> 00:22:14,006
Thanks, man.

250
00:22:14,177 --> 00:22:15,656
Never. Never.

251
00:22:16,577 --> 00:22:18,568
- Never.
- Sorry.

252
00:22:20,097 --> 00:22:22,531
Goddamnit, Jack!

253
00:22:22,617 --> 00:22:25,006
You're my brother-in-law and I love you,

254
00:22:25,097 --> 00:22:28,772
but that don't get back
the couple of grand we lost tonight.

255
00:22:28,857 --> 00:22:31,690
The deal is you lose,

256
00:22:31,777 --> 00:22:34,655
and don't tear his fuckin' arm off.

257
00:22:34,737 --> 00:22:37,012
The old man and I have enough problems.

258
00:22:37,097 --> 00:22:40,851
We're tryin' to make as much money
as we can before we lose this place.

259
00:22:40,937 --> 00:22:45,408
What do you mean, lose this place?
You ain't gonna lose this place.

260
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:48,569
- It's a landmark.
- That don't mean shit, homes.

261
00:22:48,657 --> 00:22:51,376
If money talks
and bullshit walks, we walkin'.

262
00:22:51,457 --> 00:22:53,891
And it ain't gonna be down easy street.

263
00:22:53,977 --> 00:22:55,535
What's the story, old man?

264
00:22:55,617 --> 00:23:02,648
In '56 I leased this property when nobody
wanted to be seen on this side of the hill.

265
00:23:02,737 --> 00:23:08,175
And in '66 I renewed my lease
on my own terms.

266
00:23:09,537 --> 00:23:12,256
350 a month for 30 years.

267
00:23:13,537 --> 00:23:16,927
In 21 days those 30 years have run out.

268
00:23:17,017 --> 00:23:19,975
Now with the whole world
flyin' into Burbank,

269
00:23:20,057 --> 00:23:26,053
they're tryin' to strong-arm us
for $2.5 million for a five-year lease.

270
00:23:27,177 --> 00:23:30,647
They're gonna put up another skyscraper.

271
00:23:34,737 --> 00:23:38,412
- Who's tryin' to strong-arm you?
- The bank.

272
00:23:40,297 --> 00:23:43,653
- What bank?
- Great Trust.

273
00:23:47,297 --> 00:23:50,892
- The suits?
- Hm-hmm.

274
00:23:53,097 --> 00:23:54,894
Well...

275
00:23:54,977 --> 00:23:59,687
there's only one place
to get that kind of money so fast.

276
00:23:59,777 --> 00:24:03,895
- No suit's gonna loan us $2.5 million.
<i>- (old man)</i> That's for sure.

277
00:24:03,977 --> 00:24:06,855
Man, I ain't talkin' about no loan.

278
00:24:09,977 --> 00:24:13,367
- I don't wanna hear it, Harley.
- Hear what?

279
00:24:13,457 --> 00:24:16,574
- You don't wanna know.
- Know what?

280
00:24:16,657 --> 00:24:19,376
He's gonna say we should rob the bank.

281
00:24:19,457 --> 00:24:23,735
We ain't gonna rob any damn bank.
We ain't bank robbers.

282
00:24:23,817 --> 00:24:27,332
We owe it to the old man.
We grew up in this place.

283
00:24:27,417 --> 00:24:29,772
You boys don't owe me anything.

284
00:24:30,417 --> 00:24:32,214
<i>(Harley)</i> Sure, we do.

285
00:24:32,297 --> 00:24:36,415
Hell, if it wasn't for you,
we'd all be face-down in the gutter

286
00:24:36,497 --> 00:24:40,251
with a cigarette for company and a...

287
00:24:40,337 --> 00:24:42,726
a needle for good times.

288
00:24:46,297 --> 00:24:48,686
I'm ready to go.

289
00:24:48,777 --> 00:24:51,211
- OK, baby. In a minute.
- Now!

290
00:24:56,817 --> 00:25:01,527
Count me out of this one.
I made a promise to Lulu.

291
00:25:03,577 --> 00:25:05,772
You made me a lot of promises, Jack.

292
00:25:05,857 --> 00:25:08,974
We were gonna have a baby someday.

293
00:25:09,057 --> 00:25:12,254
Can't start a family from behind bars.

294
00:25:16,417 --> 00:25:20,615
You know... I really love this place.

295
00:25:21,417 --> 00:25:24,489
It's a home. Makes me feel good.

296
00:25:24,577 --> 00:25:28,934
And if we gotta rob a bank to save it,

297
00:25:30,097 --> 00:25:32,486
I'll do that.

298
00:25:32,577 --> 00:25:34,533
But I can't do it alone.

299
00:25:34,617 --> 00:25:38,326

No, you drop it, asshole.

Come on. Get over here. Sit down.

319

not thrown.

You're the deadest shot I've ever seen.
Where'd you learn to do that?

322

Read a book. Came with the gun.

You look like a bunch
of two-bit hoods to me.

326
00:29:18,617 --> 00:29:21,336
Does that look like the work
of two-bit hoods?

327
00:29:21,417 --> 00:29:24,409
Yeah. Pros would have used my keys.

328

Your business isn't with us. It's with them.

I don't wanna hear it.

nothing to do and no one to do it with.

What the fuck is that
and what is it doin' here?

00:32:47,057 --> 00:32:51,528
It's a drug. And I don't know
what the fuck it's doin' here.

355
00:32:51,617 --> 00:32:55,326
I'm a son of a bitch.
We jumped the wrong train.

Don't worry, Jose, we ain't drug dealers.

359

This is not a walk in the park, Harley.
This is way out there on the edge.

360
00:33:12,337 --> 00:33:16,216
These guys are killers. They killed
their own men tryin' to waste us.

361
00:33:16,297 --> 00:33:18,606
That's enough, Jimmy.

362
00:33:18,697 --> 00:33:21,814
I never liked this plan from the start.

363
00:33:21,897 --> 00:33:24,172
But you needed help and you took it.

364

So don't whine about it now.

What's done is done.
There's no turnin' back.

Who are these men?

367
00:33:34,697 --> 00:33:38,246
Judging from the data we gathered,
they're dilettantes.

368
00:33:38,337 --> 00:33:44,606
Details would suggest that they were
not aware of the cargo they've stolen.

369
00:33:51,777 --> 00:33:56,646
If they're amateurs,
how'd they destroy two vehicles

370
00:33:56,737 --> 00:34:00,571
and then manage to get away
with the goods?

371
00:34:02,137 --> 00:34:04,526
They were extremely lucky.

372

And kill these men, Alexander, OK?

375
00:34:26,017 --> 00:34:27,416
¶ Yeah, yeah, yeah

376
00:34:35,457 --> 00:34:37,846
Man, we really fucked up big.

377
00:34:40,897 --> 00:34:46,654
How was I supposed to know somebody's
using a bank as a front to run drugs?

378
00:34:47,577 --> 00:34:50,489
Harley, I'm tired and I'm pissed.

379
00:34:52,017 --> 00:34:54,406
And I'd just like to unwind.

380
00:34:55,737 --> 00:34:57,773
So stop thinkin'.

381
00:34:57,857 --> 00:35:01,293

to make things right.

I know you don't know me,
but I don't have a way home

384
00:35:10,737 --> 00:35:14,013

00:35:15,337 --> 00:35:17,931
Sure, I'll give you a ride, Sally.

My old man used to tell me,
before he left this shitty world,

00:35:37,897 --> 00:35:41,287
the right woman can make you
and the wrong one can break you.

392
00:35:41,377 --> 00:35:43,766
I woke up one mornin'...

393
00:35:46,137 --> 00:35:48,128
and she was gone.

394
00:35:50,257 --> 00:35:53,055
No note. No kiss goodbye. No nothin'.

395
00:35:53,137 --> 00:35:56,925
And I still have feelings
for her deep inside.

396
00:35:58,057 --> 00:36:04,451
Partner, I only know of two cures
for that particular ailment.

397
00:36:05,217 --> 00:36:09,688
And since you don't drink any more,
you're down to one.

never chase buses or women.

- I'll bet you a dollar.

01:21:36,977 --> 01:21:40,287
Listen, Howard,
I'm not interested in the Third World.

777
01:21:40,377 --> 01:21:43,255
Too much can go the wrong way
and not much can go our way.

778
01:21:43,337 --> 01:21:46,488
We've had this discussion.
I don't ever want to have it again.

779
01:21:46,577 --> 01:21:50,855
Say hello to your wife.
You're married, aren't you?

780
01:21:54,577 --> 01:21:58,252
Lookin' for Chance Wilder. You him?

781
01:22:01,577 --> 01:22:02,646
That's right.

782
01:22:03,697 --> 01:22:05,972
Deal away, Harley.

783
01:22:06,057 --> 01:22:08,048
Well, here.

784
01:22:09,137 --> 01:22:12,573
This is yours. We took it.
It wasn't right of us.

785
01:22:12,657 --> 01:22:17,333
So now you can change the lease back
to the Rock 'N' Roll Bar and Grille.

786
01:22:17,417 --> 01:22:20,489
No handouts. No breaks.

787
01:22:20,577 --> 01:22:23,216
Just a fair deal, that's all we're asking.

788
01:22:23,297 --> 01:22:28,291
You guys must be charmed
to have made it this far.

789
01:22:28,377 --> 01:22:31,369
Four of our friends are dead.

790
01:22:31,457 --> 01:22:35,052
No, we're not charmed.
We're just pissed off.

791
01:22:35,137 --> 01:22:37,128
That's too bad.

792
01:22:38,657 --> 01:22:41,251
That's too bad.

793
01:22:41,337 --> 01:22:44,090
Sorry I pissed you off.

794
01:22:44,177 --> 01:22:49,729
Listen, the lease stands, OK?
So that's the end of that story.

795
01:22:50,417 --> 01:22:56,367
So if you came here to kill me, do it now.
If not, get the fuck outta here.

796
01:22:56,457 --> 01:23:01,690
I don't have the time to play with
guys like you, OK? I'm very busy.

797
01:23:02,737 --> 01:23:03,931
This ain't a game.

798
01:23:04,017 --> 01:23:07,009
All business is a game
one way or another.

799
01:23:07,097 --> 01:23:10,726
- Sellin' drugs ain't no game.
- It's not your average game.

800
01:23:10,817 --> 01:23:15,572
I make $500,000 a year to sit
in this office and run this bank, OK?

801
01:23:15,657 --> 01:23:21,368
I make another $50 million a year to sit
in the same office and run those drugs.

802
01:23:21,457 --> 01:23:24,255
Now, that's a big game and it's big time.

803
01:23:24,337 --> 01:23:28,250
The game's over.
Go ahead and do it, Marlboro.

804
01:23:43,057 --> 01:23:46,732
What are you waitin' for?
Kill him and let's get outta here.

805
01:23:50,897 --> 01:23:52,888
I can't do it.

806
01:23:56,097 --> 01:23:57,769
It's not right.

807
01:23:57,857 --> 01:24:02,328
Hey, this scumbag killed
four of our friends just for laughs.

808
01:24:02,417 --> 01:24:04,408
Still doesn't make it right.

809
01:24:04,497 --> 01:24:06,772
What are you talkin' about?

810
01:24:08,017 --> 01:24:11,771
My old man used to tell me,
before he left this shitty world,

811
01:24:11,857 --> 01:24:13,848
never shoot an unarmed man.

812
01:24:13,937 --> 01:24:15,893
Fuck your old man. He's dead.

813
01:24:15,977 --> 01:24:18,810
Leave my old man out of this, all right?

814
01:24:20,497 --> 01:24:24,172
- Now he's armed.
- That gun's empty, Harley.

815
01:24:25,297 --> 01:24:29,734
So what? This piece of shit
gives drugs to kids.

816
01:24:29,817 --> 01:24:31,808
Drop it!

817
01:24:41,897 --> 01:24:46,368
You guys, did you really think you were
just gonna walk in here and shoot me?

818
01:24:46,457 --> 01:24:50,655
- You thought that, didn't you?
- That was the plan.

819
01:24:51,817 --> 01:24:53,808
Yeah, that was the plan.

820
01:24:53,897 --> 01:24:57,606
You guys, you guys are a piece of work.

821
01:24:57,697 --> 01:25:01,167
You got an edge.
And I like that. I do. I like that.

822
01:25:01,257 --> 01:25:07,253
It almost makes me sorry that I have to
kill you. But I do. I do right now.

823
01:26:06,297 --> 01:26:08,686
What'd you do? You pay him?

824
01:26:09,777 --> 01:26:15,374
No, man, that was your money.
You paid him. He did that for free.

825
01:26:17,457 --> 01:26:21,814
You guys. Like your buddy said,
fuck your old man.

826
01:26:21,897 --> 01:26:26,687
He's dead, right? Fuck him.
Let's see what you're made of.

827
01:26:34,457 --> 01:26:36,448
Think fast!

828
01:27:06,177 --> 01:27:07,405
Harley!

829
01:27:13,417 --> 01:27:16,534
- Good timing.
- I told you to shoot the fuck.

830
01:27:35,337 --> 01:27:38,727
Hey, guns are made to be shot,
not thrown.

831
01:27:41,977 --> 01:27:44,775
I was just tryin' to even the odds.

832
01:27:53,657 --> 01:27:56,569
Where're you goin' this time?

833
01:27:56,657 --> 01:27:59,012
Who says I'm goin'?

834
01:27:59,097 --> 01:28:02,612
You always do, Harley. It's that time.

835
01:28:04,377 --> 01:28:06,766
You wanna come with me?

836
01:28:09,817 --> 01:28:10,932
I can't.

837
01:28:12,777 --> 01:28:16,247
I shouldn't have asked. You never say yes.

838
01:28:27,257 --> 01:28:29,168
Get the hell outta here.

839
