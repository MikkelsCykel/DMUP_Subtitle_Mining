00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,280
Alyssa.

3
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,480
This is ridiculous.

4
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,360
I want you
to go give your dad a hug.

5
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,520
Why?

6
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,360
Because he'll be gone
for his birthday.

7
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,480
Can we have a party
for him while he's gone?

8
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,920
I hope you're showered
and ready for school.

9
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,920
Sam broke his closet.

10
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:15,440
Beat it!
Get outta there! No, wait.

11
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,240
Stay there. Good boy.
Right there.

12
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,240
Come to daddy.

13
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,720
Come here, Guster!

14
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,960
Have a nice day.

15
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,440
-Stay.
-This has got to stop.

16
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,160
He escaped.
Now he's back in.

17
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:50,320
Does it give you some sort
of perverse pleasure...

18
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:55,120
to expose your penis in front
of my 16-year-old daughter?

19
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,720
My exposure does not
face your windows.

20
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,280
George, this is the third time.

21
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,160
The plumber's due out tomorrow.

22
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,120
You will just have
to explain that to the police.

23
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,600
You were the one neighbor
I could tolerate.

24
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,600
Coleen!

25
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,400
Just how far out
that window did you have...

26
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,640
to stick your head
to be able to see my dick?

27
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,120
I like your PJs!

28
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,840
I wish you'd talk to him.

29
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,200
He needs a man.

30
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,040
His father's a man.

31
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,440
-A man he respects.
-He respects nothing.

32
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,880
Thanks for talking
about me behind my back.

33
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,160
It's useful in court.

34
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,080
Are you wearing eye makeup?

35
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,120
Take it off.

36
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,280
If I just walk out
the door right now...

37
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,160
who's gonna be here tonight
for the follow-through?

38
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,760
Have a nice flight.

39
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,000
Queer.

40
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,360
What did you say?

41
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,040
Dad said it first.

42
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,200
I get chocolate cake
for your birthday.

43
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,520
Are your hands clean?

44
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,800
He's a fuckin' freak.

45
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,920
Dude, nice look.

46
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,840
I saw your dad this morning.

47
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,040
Josh, what do you say?
Is he in?

48
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,680
Been thinking
about the job, man?

49
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,720
Forget him.

50
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,920
Two hours a week
for three hundred cash.

51
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,560
The whole summer.
Do the math.

52
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,400
He's not gonna do it, Josh.

53
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,840
Guess he doesn't have it in him.

54
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:13,080
They consider this a hatchback
or a station wagon?

55
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,920
Let's get outta here, dude.

56
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,520
Think about it.
I'll be around.

57
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,920
Dude, I was in total REM.

58
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,160
Benson Kitter Architecture.
Can I help you?

59
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,360
Yes, sir.

60
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,760
Done? Close to done?

61
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,400
-I'm doing the grass.
-Fuck the grass.

62
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,200
Burke bid out the Berlin Plaza.
Did he tell you?

63
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,760
I was gonna start that
on Monday.

64
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,640
He likes the look of the
computer models better anyway.

65
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,440
You take too long.

66
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,880
When you're done
mowing the grass here...

67
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,520
do you mind bringing
the house up to my office?

68
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,720
Got a presentation to make.

69
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,280
I wouldn't make a habit of it.

70
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,520
I could be anyone.

71
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,320
Then why do you stay you?

72
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,880
You should lock your door.

73
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,360
Ring the bell before
you try the door.

74
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,040
Did Sam call to tell you
he won't be over this weekend?

75
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,360
Why did you let him
pierce his chin?

76
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,480
What kind of a mother
can't stand her own son?

77
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,440
I don't know.

78
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,880
Why aren't you coming
for the weekend?

79
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,600
What is he doing? George?

80
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,760
-George, what are you doing?
-He doesn't answer.

81
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,920
He never answers.

82
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,440
Why does he have
a lock on his door?

83
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,080
Because he put a lock on it.

84
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,520
Do you really think I told him
he could put a hole in his face?

85
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,920
Just climb up there and tell him
what he can and can't do.

86
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:08,080
Take him for the summer, OK?
Whip him into shape.

87
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:12,280
Make him smile!
Let him hate you for a while.

88
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,440
You need all the brain cells
you've got.

89
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,520
Go away!

90
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,080
I don't know what to do anymore.

91
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,800
You take him.
Just take him.

92
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,600
You're such a good father.

93
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,440
What are you doing in my room?

94
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,280
I didn't go in your room.

95
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,440
I locked the door! Get out!

96
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,720
What do you think I'm stupid?
I locked the door!

97
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,080
This is my room !

98
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,680
You have no right in here!

99
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,920
This is mine!

100
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,960
This is stupid.

101
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,400
Why can't you all just die
and leave me alone?

102
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,000
Benson, Kitter, Fein,
Silver and Associates.

103
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,280
Can I help you please?

104
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,440
George, good morning.

105
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,840
Mr. Burke would like
to see you in his office.

106
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,800
Come on in.
Have a seat.

107
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,320
-Orange juice? Croissant?
-No, I'm good.

108
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,360
What are you on, George?

109
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,520
Beg your pardon?

110
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,880
How much weight have you lost?

111
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,160
I don't know.

112
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,320
Five, ten pounds.
Haven't been very hungry.

113
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,640
How's your wife?

114
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,120
Well, when we divorced
a decade ago...

115
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,720
she was very angry.

116
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,200
Now she's just hostile.

117
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,440
Right.

118
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,880
I did tell you, didn't l,
that I would be ready...

119
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,440
to start the Berlin model today?

120
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,680
George, this is not me.

121
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:49,360
We can show clients
endless options.

122
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,960
We can change anything,
really...

123
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,120
in a matter of hours
on the computer...

124
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,960
but you won't change.

125
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,960
I've been here twenty years.

126
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,280
Maybe that's too long.

127
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,800
Maybe?

128
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,840
It's too long.

129
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,760
Listen.

130
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,560
They decided
on a week a year severance...

131
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,520
but I got 'em to twenty-six, OK?

132
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,800
You can learn all you need to on
the computer long before that.

133
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,240
You can maybe even find a job
closer to home.

134
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,400
I hate this job.

135
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,840
George,
what are you talking about?

136
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,360
You love your job.

137
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,120
Nope.
From the day I started to today.

138
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,960
Can't stand it.

139
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,400
Well, good.

140
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,800
Then it sounds like
I'm doing you a favor.

141
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,800
You know what?
I feel better about this.

142
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,040
Good. I was hoping you would.

143
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,040
-Can I ask you one favor?
-What can I do for you?

144
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:10,360
I built my first model here
when I was twenty-five.

145
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,080
There must be hundreds of 'em
around the office.

146
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:17,040
I was wondering if I might
pick a few to take home.

147
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:20,560
Just the ones that
really mean something to me.

148
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,880
Well, those--

149
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,480
I mean, George, we can't
really keep our work.

150
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,680
I could maybe ask them
if you could choose one...

151
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,200
but they're a part of the firm.

152
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,560
Look, why don't you go
out there and look them over.

153
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,920
Every single one of them, OK?

154
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,720
You pick the one
you like the best.

155
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,160
Take it with you.

156
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,040
Now, run it by me first.

157
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:48,280
Just in case, you know.
I'm sure it'll be OK.

158
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,720
Benson, Kitter, Fein,
Silver and Associates.

159
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,560
May I help you, please?
Yes, sir.

160
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,040
George, Mr. Burke
would like to see you.

161
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,120
-Fine.
-ln his office when you're able.

162
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,320
Sure.

163
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,080
I'll keep this one
if that's all right with you.

164
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,600
You're a great architect
and a miserable human being.

165
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,720
That's mine.

166
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,000
No, George, don't! Shit!

167
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,440
You're not even
a fucking architect...

168
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,120
and you're
a miserable human being.

169
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,960
You're right. You win.

170
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,800
Sir?

171
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,000
Sir, are you all right?
Can you hear me?

172
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,440
Is he breathing?

173
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,400
Come on.

174
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,840
Someone call 91 1.

175
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,480
That took care of the pain?

176
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,520
I could kiss you.

177
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,520
No food.

178
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,360
I'm painless.

179
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:53,360
What would you do if you had
three or four months to live?

180
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,240
I'd eat a lot of red meat.

181
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,560
Good for you.

182
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,200
What would you do?

183
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,320
Build a house.

184
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,560
Yeah? What kind of house?

185
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,720
You know what
mortise and tenon is?

186
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:19,040
I've got every part of it ready.
It's like a jigsaw puzzle.

187
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:23,000
Only pieces now waiting
to make sense.

188
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,280
Been through design review...

189
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,000
the planning commission,
city council.

190
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,520
No one's really said...

191
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,480
that four months
is all you have, have they?

192
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,720
Nobody's even pretended
to offer treatment.

193
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,040
So you tell me,
when would you start...

194
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,360
eating red meat?

195
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,400
Can you build a house
in four months?

196
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,880
I can die trying.

197
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,000
Good for you.

198
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,360
I've not been touched in years.

199
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:07,600
Really?
No, I mean, not a friend?

200
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,440
Your mother?
People have to be touched.

201
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,720
Everyone gets touched
by somebody they love.

202
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,000
I know.

203
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,440
It's weird, isn't it?

204
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:22,200
I know my son,
when he was younger...

205
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,880
ten or eleven even,
he used to run up...

206
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,840
and throw his arms around me.

207
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,000
I'm sorry.

208
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,960
I'm scared.

209
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,200
Where have you been?
I called everyone everywhere.

210
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,600
You just vanished.

211
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,360
-You could be dead.
-Not today.

212
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,080
You are inconsiderate and
absolutely devoid of emotion.

213
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,560
You're the most beautiful woman
that I have ever known.

214
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,200
-What?
-I don't mean just physically.

215
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,040
Even your anger is perfect.

216
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,280
And where have you been
for a week?

217
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,960
Four days.

218
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,840
I have to talk to you.

219
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,000
Why would they tow your truck?

220
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,680
I'm gonna tear down the shack
and build the house.

221
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,480
You've been saying that
for twenty years.

222
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:41,400
While we were dating
you said it.

223
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,720
-Now there's nothing to stop me.
-Oh, money?

224
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,920
Severance pay.

225
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,120
And I'm gonna cash in
my life insurance policy.

226
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,360
Where will you live?

227
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,960
In the garage.

228
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,120
Look, I wasn't serious
about you taking Sam...

229
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,360
so you don't have to get
into any actual construction...

230
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,320
to get out of it.

231
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,320
When does school let out?

232
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,000
Friday. Tomorrow.

233
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,280
Oh, God.

234
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,560
I hate the thought
of him home all day.

235
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,080
I'll be by Saturday
to pick him up.

236
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,080
He doesn't want to spend
the weekends with you anymore.

237
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,640
Not for the weekend.
For the summer.

238
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:18,320
One of you would end up dead.

239
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,240
But at least we'd have
a house to show for it.

240
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,720
Forget it, really.
I'll survive.

241
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,840
I want him with me.

242
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,440
No, you don't. Trust me.

243
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,040
I want Sam for the summer.

244
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,960
Jesus.

245
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,280
Well, I'm married.

246
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,880
The whole summer, Sam.
Party in Tahoe.

247
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,040
I don't know, Corey.
Let me think about it, OK?

248
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,760
All we gotta do is sand
and paint the cabin.

249
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,520
My dad's gonna let me
use his boat.

250
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,240
My charm's gonna
let me use my rod.

251
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,040
And you know that
lncan Village is the place...

252
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,560
to hook up with some hump.

253
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,720
OK, I'll ask.

254
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,000
All right,
I'm just saying it beats...

255
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,080
letting townfolk
go down on you for the summer.

256
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,360
I haven't done anything.

257
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,200
I know what the deal is.
Josh is a pimp. I'm not stupid.

258
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,760
Obviously you don't know
what the deal is...

259
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,720
because there is
no fucking deal.

260
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,200
Lighten up, dude.

261
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,520
-Good morning, Mr. George.
-Hiya.

262
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,240
Mrs. Kimble is in the backyard.

263
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,440
And...

264
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,600
Packing.

265
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,400
Good.

266
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:14,520
Almost ready?

267
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,440
Would you mind
turning this down?!

268
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,160
It won't be all work, you know.

269
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,240
It won't be all work!

270
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,840
I heard you already.

271
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,920
Your mom and the boys
can come by anytime.

272
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,480
What, to check up on me?

273
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,080
I'll be there
to check up on you.

274
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,520
Why would you be there?

275
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,440
Well, I live there.

276
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,800
You live in Corey's
parents' cabin in Tahoe?

277
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,760
What are you talking about?

278
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,920
-Who's Corey?
-Corey's my friend.

279
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,080
I'm going to spend
the summer, OK?

280
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,560
No, you're not going anywhere.

281
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,120
You're spending the summer
with me.

282
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,400
Shit! No fucking way!

283
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,400
Robin, did you tell Sam he was
spending the summer with me?

284
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,560
What was I supposed to do?

285
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,040
I tried to call.
Your phone isn't working.

286
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,200
I don't have a phone anymore.

287
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,960
Who are you, anyway?
I don't even know you.

288
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,280
You'll know me
by the time we're through.

289
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,440
I'm not going.

290
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,640
I'll get your bag.

291
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,760
Would you tell him
that I'm not going?

292
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,880
You already promised me!

293
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,960
-George, I did say he could go.
-ls this everything?

294
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,320
Mom, please. Tell him !

295
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,520
George, l...

296
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:27,240
He is not spending
the entire summer...

297
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,520
with some kid in Tahoe!

298
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:32,680
He can hate me.
You can hate me.

299
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,160
He can try to kill me
while I'm sleeping!

300
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,480
I don't care!

301
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:38,440
Sam is spending
the summer with me, OK?

302
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,960
He's my son. He's sixteen.

303
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,240
That's it!

304
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,120
Can I hate you, too?

305
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,040
You can do anything you want.

306
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,680
-Go get in the truck.
-You go fuck yourself!

307
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,160
Listen to me.

308
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,960
I want that thing
out of your chin, OK?

309
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,560
You got nipple rings,
naval rings...

310
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,720
those come out, too.

311
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,520
And there's no makeup
at my house.

312
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,080
No glue sniffing, huffing...

313
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,560
no pills, no grass.

314
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,880
You've worn out your welcome
at this house, Sam.

315
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,240
This may well be the worst
summer of your entire life...

316
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,440
but you've earned it.

317
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,440
Now go pick up the suitcase,
get in the truck, now.

318
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,160
I'll hate you
for the rest of my life.

319
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,680
Well, you can't even begin to
know how much I hate my father.

320
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,280
Think of it
as a family tradition.

321
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,720
You like garlic?

322
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,120
Do you like garlic bread?

323
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,320
Thinking of jumping?

324
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,400
Pushing.

325
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,400
Well, don't jump
till you hear...

326
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,760
the wave crash
against the cliff.

327
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,040
Water'll take you out.
Let it.

328
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,400
First time I did it,
younger than you...

329
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,800
I thought I'd break my neck...

330
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,320
and just sort of
float out to Catalina.

331
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,600
You don't always get
what you wish for, Sam.

332
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,440
Shit.

333
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,480
Hello!

334
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,360
Oh, my God.

335
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,960
I don't believe this!

336
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,400
Are you totally insane?

337
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,680
God!

338
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,320
I don't believe this.

339
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,320
I got a total wacko
for a father.

340
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,320
I almost saw Catalina!

341
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,920
What have you gotten
all over yourself?

342
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,680
What is this?
Is this pasta sauce?

343
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,920
You crazy dog, Guster.

344
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,200
Come here. Lick it.

345
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,000
You're crazy, you know this?

346
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,800
What are you doing here?

347
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:43,120
They're trying to make me
spend the summer here...

348
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,760
but I'm leaving in the morning.

349
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,480
Where to?

350
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,320
I'm supposed to be in Tahoe.

351
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,920
I guess if you stay,
I'll see you around.

352
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,720
You should stay.

353
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,120
Where's your dad?

354
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,320
He jumped into the ocean.

355
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,040
Well, tell him I say hello.

356
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,960
I'm not taking a dump
with you in here.

357
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,560
My brothers say that it's the
worst smell they've ever smelt.

358
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,440
Which side of the bed
do you want?

359
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,800
-I'm not--
-Just kidding.

360
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,840
The sofa's a pull-out.

361
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,240
Jesus.

362
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:06,520
You know, I think
you have to have a door...

363
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:09,640
between where you cook
and where you crap.

364
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,960
Even in the bush,
tribal people don't like that.

365
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,520
They have a place for both.

366
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,560
Probably it's, like, a law.

367
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,760
God !

368
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,320
Probably in the Bible.

369
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,920
It's at least
a building code violation.

370
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,120
Good night.

371
00:31:32,160 --> 00:32:20,200
I have to take a dump.

372
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,000
You wearing sunscreen?

373
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:27,280
Are you wearing sunscreen?

374
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,000
I wonder where he's living?

375
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,360
About time.

376
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,720
They're finally tearing down
this pile of junk.

377
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,600
Barbara, Tom.

378
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,760
Guess how many
low-income apartments...

379
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,120
the city approved for this lot.

380
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,480
Ballpark figure.

381
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,800
No. Not today.

382
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:55,280
There was also some talk
about a drug-rehab center.

383
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,600
Jerk.

384
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,600
We can't do anything.

385
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,000
What are you doing?
Don't touch me.

386
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,440
I warned you yesterday.

387
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,400
You can't touch me.

388
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,240
You stayed.

389
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,800
Rub him down, will you, Alyssa?

390
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,080
He's insane.

391
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,720
You look better without makeup.

392
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,800
I can't even take a shower here.

393
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,760
Come over to my house
whenever you want.

394
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,520
I'll tell my mom.

395
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:42,080
I might not even stay anyway.

396
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,720
I'll get your back.

397
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,920
No, that's OK. Thanks.

398
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,240
Have you ever had anyone
besides your mom or dad...

399
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,360
put it on for you?

400
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,400
It's weird how different it is.

401
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,040
Turn around. Just lay down.

402
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,320
Do you remember me?

403
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:59,240
From when you lived here before?

404
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:03,440
So I've decided that
I'm not going to shave...

405
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:06,000
my legs or my pits this summer.

406
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,480
I mean, Paula Cole
isn't a vertical kisser.

407
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:10,480
Really?

408
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:13,640
So, your dad's really
going to build his house?

409
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:15,000
I don't know.

410
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,960
You know, your dad dated my mom
after her divorce.

411
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,080
Really?

412
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,880
Yeah. I wanted him to marry her.

413
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,240
Why?

414
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,240
Turn over.

415
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,640
Josh and I are actually
going to South Coast.

416
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:37,200
Do you want a ride?
Maybe see a movie?

417
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,040
No, thanks.

418
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:42,120
All right, well,
don't forget your front.

419
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,960
I'll see you around.

420
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,560
Pretty, isn't she?

421
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,480
For a girl.

422
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,720
Feel free to pitch in anytime.

423
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,200
Sam, do you ever...

424
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,120
get the slightest inkling that
you might want to help me...

425
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:12,600
instead of doing
absolutely nothing?

426
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,520
Here.

427
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,680
I hate turkey.

428
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,560
No, you don't.

429
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:24,840
If I say I do, I do.

430
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:30,640
Please, take that thumbtack
out of your face.

431
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,800
-Let me just get it out.
-Why?

432
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,120
Come on. It bugs me.

433
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,480
You snore at night.
That really bugs me.

434
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,560
Can I take you out?

435
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,200
You know, your brothers
are right about that smell.

436
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,800
That was the most
god-awful thing...

437
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,240
I've ever had my nose around.

438
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,400
-Told you.
-It's toxic.

439
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,000
Thought you guys
might be hungry.

440
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,200
We're fine.

441
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,520
Turkey sandwiches.

442
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,680
Oh, well. For later, then.

443
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,720
-Makes me sad.
-Why?

444
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,600
I used to live here.

445
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,120
Yeah, and you hated four out of
the five years that you did.

446
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:20,920
I was here six years,
and I only hated two.

447
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:23,440
Which two?

448
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,800
The first and the last.

449
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,840
I don't even like
turkey sandwiches.

450
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,320
What's this pizza?

451
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,560
Sam's favorite.

452
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,400
Sure you don't want any?

453
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,720
George, you're too thin--

454
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:43,760
from what you used to be anyway.

455
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,800
Why the first and the last?

456
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:50,280
The first because I wasn't sure
you really loved me...

457
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:53,840
and the last because I wasn't
sure I really loved you.

458
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,800
I was up on that roof
this morning tearing it down...

459
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:03,760
and it struck me,
strong as anything ever has--

460
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,120
I'm happy today.

461
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,640
What were you before today?

462
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:13,240
I don't know what it was--

463
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,600
the way the sun struck the ocean
or the sound of the waves.

464
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,200
It was simple, whatever it was.

465
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,480
Then I started thinking...

466
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:27,400
when the last time was
that I felt like this.

467
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,360
Do you remember?

468
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,560
Yeah, the one time
I remember for sure.

469
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:41,240
I was with Sam in the ocean...

470
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,240
saving him from the waves.

471
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:48,360
He had his head on my shoulder,
and we were laughing.

472
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:54,680
I could feel his heart
pounding against my chest.

473
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:01,720
I remember I kissed his hair.

474
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,760
This was before it was blue.

475
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,840
We have it on video.

476
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:14,320
It was when my parents were
down for his sixth birthday.

477
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,840
I remember that.

478
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,240
I got to go.

479
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,520
What is it?

480
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:37,080
Oh, nothing. I'm fine.

481
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:39,600
I'll drop off your lunch
tomorrow.

482
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,440
I'm going for a walk.

483
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,040
I need some money.

484
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,360
You'll have money when you work.

485
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,600
You're predictable.

486
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,200
You haven't been happy
in ten years?

487
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,680
I'm not doing it.

488
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,400
It's going to be good.

489
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:15,400
You know, nobody
would blame me if I left.

490
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:19,600
I'd blame you.
I want you here.

491
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:22,800
Why don't you just go and
beg some money off of my dad...

492
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:25,520
so you can move
into someplace decent...

493
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:28,080
with a real kitchen
and a real bathroom?

494
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:33,440
I'd rather sell my nuts
to a castrati.

495
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,160
I don't beg.

496
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,400
And I don't take a shower
in the middle of the yard!

497
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,000
I can promise you
complete privacy.

498
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,480
No, you can't!

499
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,000
You can't promise me anything...

500
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,960
because you don't
have anything to promise.

501
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:48,520
You live in a garage, OK?
You don't have cable.

502
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,800
You're not hooked up
for the internet...

503
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,600
because you don't even
own a computer.

504
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:56,120
And you don't have a job.

505
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,480
Just try it.

506
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:05,080
That's all I'm asking.

507
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,760
Come on, Sam.
I'm begging, OK?

508
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:12,400
Go fuck yourself.

509
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:25,880
Is Alyssa home?

510
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,320
She went out with a friend.

511
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,520
I didn't recognize you.

512
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:40,560
Alyssa said you two don't even
have plumbing over there.

513
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,680
Not a shower.

514
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,320
Come on.

515
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:55,440
I hope your ex-husband's
equipped for the havoc of Sam...

516
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:58,320
because it seems absolutely
blissful here tonight.

517
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,120
There you go.

518
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:16,840
Do you think it's odd
your kids don't hug you?

519
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,160
Should l?

520
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:20,760
It would worry me.

521
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,720
If I let everything that
should worry me worry me...

522
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:26,480
I'd be dead from worry.

523
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:29,960
What would you be
if you asked Ryan and Adam...

524
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,360
to run in here right now
and hug you?

525
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,800
I'd be you.

526
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:40,560
I'll do it,
if that's what you want.

527
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,080
Kurt, is that you?

528
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:51,120
There has to be
a logical explanation.

529
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,320
No hot water.

530
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:55,960
Your buddy Mr. Dokos
called to complain...

531
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,080
that you and a boy are squatting
illegally in your garage.

532
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:02,800
Check the permits.

533
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:05,360
It was built as a guest house.

534
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,440
It's a legally-rentable unit.

535
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:12,680
Now, that's got to be illegal.

536
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,760
Dokos?

537
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,640
I'll piss on his lawn.

538
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:25,120
Bro, I need you tonight.

539
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:28,960
I locked the door.

540
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:33,520
lt'll take you
twenty, thirty minutes.

541
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:35,120
Does Alyssa know?

542
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:36,320
No. Nothing.

543
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:37,720
She sent me up here
to see if you wanted...

544
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:40,280
to hang out with her
and her mom and watch a movie.

545
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:41,840
You got any more weed?

546
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:44,240
You got any money?

547
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:47,200
Three hundred cash, two hours.

548
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:00,840
You don't have to do a thing.

549
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:04,680
Just get in, get out
as quick as you can.

550
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:07,320
Close your eyes.

551
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:09,240
Think of whatever.

552
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:14,200
So, what's the deal
between you and Alyssa?

553
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:17,320
Don't even. I'm there.

554
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:20,320
I didn't know. I'm sorry.

555
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:23,760
She wouldn't even fucking go out
with me until she was sixteen.

556
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:28,360
That wasn't even a rule.
That was just her own thing.

557
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:31,600
She figures things out
on her own, and that's it.

558
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:42,840
If this rings, run.

559
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,200
He already knows about
everything you can't do.

560
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:50,640
And you can tell him
not to look at you if you want.

561
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:53,240
This feels too weird now.

562
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:56,240
I don't like it.

563
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:06,160
Beats working.

564
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,960
You want to roll down
the window, please?

565
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:57,080
Look at me.

566
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:59,000
What'd you just toss
into the brush?

567
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,200
Nothing.

568
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,760
Hey, you ! Kid !

569
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:05,440
Stop right there!
Hold it, kid !

570
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:11,480
Turn off your engine.

571
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,920
Lunch.

572
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,640
Lunch? It's not breakfast yet.

573
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:28,720
I dreamed about your house
last night.

574
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:30,200
Finished or unfinished?

575
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,920
It was perfect, George.

576
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:33,400
It was amazing.

577
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:34,640
It was so real.

578
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,120
Didn't you once dream that
you could lick people well?

579
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,240
That wasn't a dream.
That was Sam.

580
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:43,760
Right.

581
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:45,000
His ear infection.

582
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:48,200
My tongue around the edge
of his ear is what cured him.

583
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:51,440
Will you go in that garage
and lick his attitude?

584
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:53,840
The antibiotics
weren't working...

585
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:57,040
and that is what I believe,
George.

586
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:03,280
You're wrong
about that first year.

587
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:13,360
I've been wrong
a lot in my life.

588
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:18,640
Hindsight.

589
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:22,960
It's like foresight
without a future.

590
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,800
I have three hours
before I go get the kids.

591
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:34,040
Where will I be most useful?

592
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:36,920
With your hands or your tongue?

593
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:38,920
You're not well.

594
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:48,920
-I just hit it?
-Hit it as hard as you can.

595
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,720
That's it. Yes.

596
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:58,880
I should go.

597
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,240
-Good morning.
-Sam, Ryan has a game later.

598
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:15,760
He asked if you'd go watch.

599
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,720
George Monroe?

600
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,720
-Robin.
-Excuse me.

601
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:29,920
Mr. Monroe.

602
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:34,240
I've been dreading you.

603
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:36,800
Bob Larson, city inspector.

604
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:38,000
Hi, Bob.

605
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,560
Do you have
an unenclosed toilet...

606
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:42,160
in proximity to a kitchen?

607
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:46,760
-A violation?
-Yes.

608
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,600
And if I enclose it?

609
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:51,400
An exhaust system
or a window is code.

610
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,800
Where is it?

611
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:56,600
A friend of yours is here.

612
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:59,600
Did you go through my pants?

613
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:01,880
I want it back.
Where'd you put it?

614
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:04,720
I think I may have a solution.

615
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:06,800
Where'd you hide it?

616
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:09,400
You're unbelievable,
you know that?

617
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:10,560
Where is it?

618
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,920
Where'd you put it,
in these shirts?

619
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,000
Just tell me where it is.

620
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:18,280
I'll look for it myself.
You don't have to--

621
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:20,600
Would you stop that?

622
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:35,440
I want to know where it is now!

623
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:37,520
You got no right
going through my things...

624
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:39,600
you know that?
It's an invasion of privacy.

625
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:43,920
I need that back.
I had to work for that.

626
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:47,760
-Doors.
-I hate to ask about the window.

627
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:50,000
Where is it?

628
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:51,200
I flushed it down the toilet.

629
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:55,120
No! Oh, my God.

630
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:12,880
If I had a gun,
I swear to God I'd kill you.

631
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:16,400
What's in my pants is none
of your fucking business.

632
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:17,680
Look, I'd say
you're in compliance.

633
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:19,120
I hope this makes
the pain in the ass...

634
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:20,920
that called you happy.

635
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,960
-You and me both.
-Bye.

636
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,520
Everything about you
is my business--

637
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:28,840
what you smoke, what you sniff,
what you swallow.

638
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:30,520
It's all my business.

639
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:33,200
I've been using
since I was twelve!

640
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:37,960
You're also unbelievably stupid,
you know that?

641
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,080
You didn't give a shit about
anything I did up until now!

642
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:44,280
I'll apologize
for everything but today!

643
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:46,360
Today, I give a shit!

644
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,040
Yeah? You're too fucking late.

645
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:49,440
These gloves are for you.

646
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:51,120
You can't make me do a thing.

647
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:53,040
-Sit down.
-No!

648
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:54,360
I'll call the cops--

649
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:57,720
Get off!

650
00:52:57,720 --> 00:52:59,120
That's child abuse!

651
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:00,240
You're in big shit now!

652
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:03,480
People go to prison
for what you just did to me!

653
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:14,000
My dad used to play this game.

654
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:15,320
I never really even
understood what it was...

655
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:16,480
until after he was gone.

656
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:19,320
I was holding for somebody else.
It wasn't even mine.

657
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:22,200
The game was to make me
smaller than he was--

658
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:24,600
smaller, always smaller.

659
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:25,800
No matter what.

660
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:27,720
He could be almost invisible
as a human being...

661
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:30,080
but I still had to be smaller.

662
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:32,520
So that if I got
good grades in school...

663
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:34,240
then I was a pussy
for not playing football.

664
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:36,680
Or if I cut my hair for him...

665
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:37,960
it was never short enough.

666
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,720
Or if I shaved my head,
then I looked like a psycho.

667
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:42,520
I never won the game--never.

668
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:44,920
And if he couldn't...

669
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:48,560
make me smaller with words...

670
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:54,800
I'll have to pay him back.

671
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:04,880
I won't ever hit you.

672
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:07,280
Ever.

673
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:08,640
I don't want you smaller.

674
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:11,120
I want you to be happy.
You're not.

675
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:13,240
Not here with me,
not home with your mother...

676
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:15,160
not alone, not anywhere.

677
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:17,720
You're what I was
most of my life, Sam.

678
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:20,120
I see it in your eyes,
in your sleep...

679
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:21,800
in your answer to everything.

680
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:24,720
You're barely alive.

681
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:26,480
I'm not even listening.

682
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:28,920
You know the great thing,
though?

683
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:31,320
Is that change
can be so constant...

684
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:32,960
that you don't even
feel the difference...

685
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,520
until there is one.

686
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:38,480
It can be so slow
that you don't know...

687
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:43,280
that your life is better
or worse till it is.

688
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:45,520
Or it can just blow you away...

689
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:47,120
make you something different
in an instant.

690
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:53,520
It happened to me.

691
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,760
Build this house with me.

692
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:02,320
Come on.

693
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,680
You fuck.

694
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:32,160
I have to pay back what you
flushed down the toilet.

695
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:34,280
I want ten dollars an hour,
then I'm done.

696
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:44,880
This all has to come down
before we can start again.

697
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:49,040
Knock it down.

698
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:59,520
I have hated this house
from the moment my father...

699
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:01,160
put it in my name.

700
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:04,680
Twenty-five years
of hating what you live in.

701
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,680
Hating what you are.

702
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:09,240
This is an end of it, Sam.

703
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:12,680
Finally gonna build
something of my own.

704
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,760
Something I can be proud
to give you.

705
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:16,520
Don't.

706
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:19,360
-I don't want it.
-Fine.

707
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:21,280
You can do whatever
you want with it.

708
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:22,760
All I want is for you
to remember...

709
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:24,520
that we built a house together.

710
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:26,600
We haven't built shit.

711
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:29,520
You're just tearing
your father down.

712
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:31,040
Try it. Feels good.

713
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:47,520
Go!

714
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:52,400
Come on!

715
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:02,840
After you.

716
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:08,800
It's going down.
That's it.
