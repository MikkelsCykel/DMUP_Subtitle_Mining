1
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,674
<i>Rock of ages cleft for me</i>

2
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,152
<i>Let me hide myself in thee</i>

3
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,871
<i>Let the water and the blood</i>

4
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,160
<i>From thy wounded side which flowed</i>

5
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,110
<i>Be of sin the double cure</i>

6
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,511
<i>Save from wrath</i>

7
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,478
<i>and make me pure</i>

8
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:20,475
"Judge me, O Lord,
for I have walked in mine integrity.

9
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,791
"I have trusted also in the Lord,

10
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:27,316
"therefore I shall not slide.

11
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:32,031
"Examine me, O Lord, and prove me.

12
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,714
"Try my reins and my heart.

13
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,873
"For thy loving kindness
is before mine eyes

14
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,271
"and I have walked in thy truth.

15
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,149
"I have not sat with evil persons,

16
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:50,359
"neither will I go in with dissemblers.

17
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:54,229
"I will wash mine hands in innocency.

18
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,110
"So will I compass thine altar, O Lord.

19
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,034
"That I may publish
with the voice of thanksgiving

20
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,749
"and tell of all thy wondrous works..."

21
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,435
- Loggins' funeral?
- Yes, ma'am.

22
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,120
- Ain't related, are you?
- Related?

23
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,592
We're looking for the child's kin.
Thought I saw some resemblance.

24
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,153
No kin?

25
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:26,552
None we know of, except in Missouri.
Seems you got the child's jaw.

26
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,154
No, just a friend of her mama.

27
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,675
If ever a child needed a friend...

28
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,400
"...will I bless the Lord.

29
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,279
- "Amen."
- Amen.

30
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,871
Amen, Essie Mae.
I just know your ass is still warm.

31
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,511
Would you like some water, Addie?
We'll get the child some water.

32
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:58,150
Bless you, child. I wanted
to pay my respects to your mama.

33
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:02,074
- I have to go. It's a long way to St Louis.
- St Louis, Missouri?

34
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,597
Yes, ma'am. I sell the Good Book.
Just spreading the Lord's good news.

35
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:11,311
Addie, don't you have your Aunt Billie
living in St Joseph, Missouri?

36
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,391
Her poor mother's sister.

37
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,994
- Her only known relative.
- That so?

38
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,516
If you're driving your chariot to Missouri,
you could take her.

39
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,515
- I wouldn't call it a chariot, Reverend.
- I'll write the woman a letter tonight.

40
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:29,390
I have to think upon this. I may
have to make a few stops along the way.

41
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:34,315
- I never travelled with no child before.
- The child's got no place to go!

42
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,198
Well...

43
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,073
...in the eyes of the Lord,
I have no choice.

44
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,994
- Hallelujah!
- God works in mysterious ways.

45
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,757
Come on, Addie, better get your things.
This nice man's taking you to your aunt.

46
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,755
How come you're taking me?

47
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:05,277
- How come you're taking me?
- 'Cause I'm going that way, honey.

48
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,592
Although I do want to make just one stop
before we leave town.

49
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:13,958
- Got a little business to do.
- You know my mama real good?

50
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,031
Oh, pretty good.

51
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,079
You just stay out here.
Don't you say a word unless I ask you to.

52
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,390
- Mr Robertson?
- That's right.

53
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,597
- I'd like a minute of your time.
- Not buying today.

54
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:49,389
- Just want you to meet somebody.
- So what?

55
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,472
- Tell him your name, honey.
- Addie. Addie Loggins.

56
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,236
You done real fine. I'll be out in a minute.

57
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,392
- Ain't she a sweet child?
- No, she ain't.

58
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,028
Maybe not now, because she's sad,

59
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:09,034
with her mama dead and
your drunken brother hitting that tree.

60
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,953
What are you trying to pull? Get out!

61
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,839
- <i>I'm going. I'll tell you where.</i>
- <i>I don't care!</i>

62
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,718
<i>To see J T Faraday.</i>

63
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,634
You know who he is?
One of the biggest lawyers in Kansas.

64
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,268
He don't favour the man with the money.

65
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,638
Know what's going to happen
to your brother? A lawsuit against him.

66
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:33,750
Everything's going to be tied up in knots.
His money, his house, all he owns!

67
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,797
Including half this plant.

68
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:40,272
Don't think that poor child ain't entitled,
'cause she is.

69
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,194
Now, I was thinking,
$2,000 would be acceptable.

70
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,191
I'll give you 200.

71
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,477
- $200?
- $200.

72
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,313
It's a deal.

73
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,991
There you are.

74
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,118
That'll be $67.54.

75
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:18,592
- You sure these tyres are new?
- $67.54.

76
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,797
Now, we'll have you to St Jo in no time.

77
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:36,193
- When's the next train to St Joseph?
- St Joseph? Let's see.

78
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:41,798
That'll be the 4.14. Change trains in
Kansas City and into St Jo at 9.52 a.m.

79
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,110
One child's price ticket.

80
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,239
$11.45.

81
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,313
Send a telegram to Mrs Billie Roy Griggs,
Cosmo Row, St Joseph.

82
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:59,190
"Train arriving 9.52 a.m. And bringing
love, affection and $20 cash."

83
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,717
Make that $25 cash
and sign it just Addie Loggins.

84
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:07,395
Ten words, that will be 85 cents more.

85
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,790
That will be $12.30.

86
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,871
$12.30?

87
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,874
You'd better say in that message,
"Love, affection and $20 cash."

88
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,918
"Love, affection and $20 cash."

89
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:34,436
Here's your ticket,
and $20 for your Aunt Billie.

90
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,631
We got till 4.15.

91
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:44,753
I don't suppose you can wait here
by yourself, can you?

92
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,870
You hungry? Want a Nehi
and a Coney Island?

93
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,915
- Ain't you eating?
- I ain't hungry.

94
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,992
You worried about going on the train?
You'll like it.

95
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,153
You'll soon be at your aunt's
and all your troubles over. So, eat up.

96
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,231
- She don't know me.
- She will.

97
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,278
- She ain't going to want me.
- She ain't seen you yet.

98
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,035
Never even cared for my mama.
And she was her sister.

99
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,078
- Your mama was fine.
- Everybody says she weren't!

100
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,313
- Everybody don't know your mama.
- How good you know her?

101
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,995
Enough to know you can be proud
of the happiness she gave.

102
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,879
Eat your Coney Island.

103
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,600
You meet her in a bar-room?

104
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:59,039
- Where would you get that question?
- I hear talk, wondering if you was my pa.

105
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,352
Well, don't the world have a wild
imagination?

106
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,909
Eat your Coney Island.

107
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,355
You my pa?

108
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:12,308
Course I ain't your pa.
I'll get you some relish.

109
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,750
Coney Island ain't no good without relish.

110
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:22,278
Look, I know how you feel. I lost my ma
and pa. I don't know where my sister is.

111
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:26,672
I wish I could tell you I'm your pa,
but it just ain't like that.

112
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,756
You met her in a bar!

113
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:35,153
Just because a man meets a woman
in a bar don't mean he's your pa! Eat up!

114
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,596
Then if you ain't my pa, I want my $200!

115
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:47,832
I want my $200. I heard you
through the door, talking to that man.

116
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,911
It's my money and I want it.

117
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,874
- You hold on a second...
- I want my money. You took my $200!

118
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,237
- Will you quiet down?
- I want my $200!

119
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:03,349
- Hold on. Let me explain something.
- If you was my pa, that'd be different!

120
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:07,513
- Well, I ain't! Get that out of your head.
- I look like that.

121
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,992
You don't look any more like me
than you do that Coney Island! Eat it!

122
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,754
- We got the same jaw.
- Lots of people do!

123
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,115
- It's possible!
- It ain't!

124
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,192
- Then I want my $200!
- All right!

125
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,830
We got the same jaw. I know a woman
that looks like a bullfrog.

126
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,675
- That don't mean she's its mother!
- You met my mom in a bar.

127
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,752
You think everybody gets met in a bar
gets a baby?

128
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:35,675
- It's possible.
- Anything is. Possible don't make it true.

129
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:39,674
- Then I want my money!
- Will you quiet down?

130
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,637
The trouble with you is
you got no appreciation.

131
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,839
Maybe I did get a little money
from that man and you're entitled to that.

132
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,437
I'm entitled to my share for getting it for
you. Where would you be without me?

133
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,637
Think them folks would spend a penny to
send you east?

134
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,758
Who got you a ticket?
Who got you a Coney Island?

135
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,754
And threw in $20 extra, not to mention
85 cents for that telegram.

136
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:09,040
You wouldn't have had that without me.
I didn't have to take you, but I took you.

137
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,193
I think that's fair enough.
We're both a little better off.

138
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,592
You get to St Jo. I get myself
a little better car. Fair is fair.

139
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,397
Now, drink your Nehi
and eat your Coney Island.

140
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,352
I want my $200.

141
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:32,399
I don't have your $200 no more
and you know it.

142
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:37,350
If you don't give me my $200, I'm going
to tell a policeman how you got it

143
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,796
and he'll make you give it to me,
'cause it's mine.

144
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,838
But I don't have it!

145
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,790
Then get it.

146
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,318
How we doing, angel pie? Going to have
dessert when we finish our hot dog?

147
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,118
I don't know.

148
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:01,398
Daddy, why don't we get Precious
a dessert if she eats her dog?

149
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,632
Her name ain't Precious.

150
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:10,919
I want my money back on this ticket
and send this telegram, "Trip delayed,

151
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,548
"but I'm coming real soon!"

152
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,679
Lie quiet.

153
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:49,118
Folks don't take to children
when they're doing business.

154
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,633
- Yes?
- Ma'am, is Mr Morgan at home?

155
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,119
Mr Morgan?

156
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:29,239
My name is Moses Pray,
Kansas Bible Company. He'll know.

157
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,312
I'm sorry. Mr Morgan has passed on.

158
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,836
Oh, ma'am, I just...
I don't know what to say.

159
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,879
- What were you seeing him about?
- He ordered this here Bible...

160
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,555
- Rudolph ordered a Bible?
- The de luxe with the lady's name on it.

161
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:47,633
- Lady's name?
- I expect a special gift to a family friend.

162
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:52,954
Under the circumstances, I'll give you
back his dollar deposit with no obligation.

163
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,033
Ma'am, I don't know how
to put into words the sorrow I feel.

164
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,475
What name is on it?

165
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:04,668
I don't really know what name Mr Morgan
had put on it, ma'am. Let's see.

166
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,877
It's here somewhere. I've got it.
Here it is...

167
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,917
- Pearl.
...Pearl.

168
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:14,437
- I'm Pearl.
- He must have got this for you, ma'am.

169
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,636
Yes, he bought it for me.

170
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,395
- Of course. You're not obliged to take it.
- Of course I'll take it.

171
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,269
There's one thing. I told him
I could sell him a cheaper Bible,

172
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:30,515
but he wanted the best, being the de luxe
with the lady's name printed in gold...

173
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:34,798
- Oh, he would.
...bringing a balance due of $8.

174
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,279
$8?

175
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,159
Well, that's $8, minus the dollar deposit,

176
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:42,471
- making it $7.
- I'll go get my purse.

177
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:47,998
- You're not obliged to take it.
- Of course I am. He ordered the de luxe!

178
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,438
<i>Cold or not,</i>
<i>it's good to be back in Manhattan.</i>

179
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:56,388
<i>Jack, you've been here since Thursday.</i>
<i>What have you done?</i>

180
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,314
<i>I've had a lot of fun, Don.</i>
<i>I saw some shows, went to nightclubs.</i>

181
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,995
<i>Last night, I was invited</i>
<i>to Fred Allen's apartment for dinner.</i>

182
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,674
- <i>Fred Allen?</i>
- <i>We're good friends.</i>

183
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,832
<i>I'm glad to hear it.</i>
<i>Has Fred got a nice apartment?</i>

184
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,074
<i>How could I tell, Don, with all that</i>
<i>laundry hanging in the living room?</i>

185
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:21,753
- Ain't you going to go to sleep?
- Don't you want to hear Jack Benny?

186
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,239
No!

187
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,436
<i>I don't want to sound catty...</i>

188
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:01,271
You're too young to smoke! You're going
to set this whole place on fire.

189
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:28,230
I now owe you $103.72.

190
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,237
74.

191
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,840
Roosevelt said we're all feeling better.

192
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,470
- He did?
- Made me feel good saying that.

193
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:08,794
- Better than I've felt in a long time.
- Bet old Frank wishes you was 21.

194
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,109
You don't like me, do you?

195
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,629
No, I don't like you!

196
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,279
- Yes?
- Ma'am, is Mr Bates at home?

197
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,318
Mr Bates is dead. He died a week ago.

198
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,314
Passed over? I was just talking to him
not less than a month ago.

199
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,234
- What was it you wanted?
- My name is Pray, Kansas Bible Co.

200
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,914
I have this Bible Mr Bates ordered.

201
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:44,072
- Bible?
- Who is it? What's the trouble?

202
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,711
- It's about Benjamin buying a Bible.
- Bible? What kind of Bible?

203
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,678
Says he talked to Benjamin a month ago.

204
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,308
I'm not sure of the dates.

205
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,679
Benjamin didn't go near that shop
for more than a month before he died.

206
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,400
I may be mixed up on the dates.

207
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,869
What company are you from?

208
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,998
Kansas Bible Company, out of Wichita.

209
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,596
- I ain't never heard of it.
- Daddy?

210
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,355
Can't we go? I want to get
to church and pray for Mama.

211
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:21,279
Yeah, sure we can, honey.
Daddy was just fixing to leave.

212
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,079
This is my little girl. It's just the two of us.

213
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,710
- My mama's gone to the Lord.
- So has poor Mr Bates.

214
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:31,350
Here's his deposit. Let us know
if there's anything we can do.

215
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,398
Hold on there! Wait one damn minute.

216
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,677
- He actually ordered a Bible?
- He did. Here it is.

217
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,753
- In gold, for somebody named Marie.
- That's her. She's Marie.

218
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:47,629
She meant a lot to him.
He wanted the de luxe edition.

219
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,631
- How much?
- That's...

220
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,872
- It's the $12 one, Daddy!
- $12?

221
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:57,795
Honey, we have to have a little goodness
in our hearts in the circumstances.

222
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,394
If it'll make that woman happy,

223
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,232
I'll take it.

224
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,995
You owe me $85.74.

225
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:26,879
<i>I mean, we're going to Washington</i>
<i>on the Q T.</i>

226
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:31,875
<i>Molly, she says we can't go on the Q T,</i>
<i>we got to take</i> The Pennsylvania.

227
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,838
<i>I'd better go! Where's my suitcase?</i>

228
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,039
- <i>I don't know, McGee. You had it last.</i>
- <i>I know. It's in the hall.</i>

229
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,760
He's going to open the closet.

230
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,199
He'll say he's got to straighten it out.

231
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,272
<i>Got to straighten out that closet</i>
<i>one of these days.</i>

232
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,239
- Would you like to do business with me?
- Instead of paying me back?

233
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:03,916
I'll pay you back. While we head east,
how about we do business together?

234
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:10,271
You're looking at me
like I'm out to cheat you. It's business.

235
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:14,399
Take it or leave it. Turn off that radio.
You'll drive us all deaf with it.

236
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:19,190
<i>... in an average way, of course.</i>

237
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,109
OK. Remember one thing,
I decide on the price.

238
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:31,636
Maybe you don't know French,
but there's finesse!

239
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:35,270
I never sold no Bible for $12.
That man was a law officer!

240
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,228
- We got it, didn't we?
- I don't care if we got it!

241
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:44,633
Don't you go making the decisions!
You just got to look like a pretty little girl.

242
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,358
You ain't got a ribbon in that cigar box?

243
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:57,435
I got my mom's kimono in my
suitcase, Chinaman with umbrellas.

244
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,670
That ain't what I had in mind.

245
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:12,672
You look real nice in that ribbon. First off,
I didn't know was she a boy or a girl.

246
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:17,118
- I'm a girl!
- Well, it makes all the difference.

247
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:22,400
- Ain't she got a sweet face? Somehow.
- We'll take a ribbon in each colour.

248
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:25,711
- How much is that going to cost me?
- That'll be 15 cents.

249
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,395
Bought my grandchildren ribbons
just like this, last holiday.

250
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:32,393
Grandchildren? I don't believe it.

251
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:36,678
You can believe it all right.
I'm just as old as I look.

252
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,751
Now, here you be.

253
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:43,038
That's one, two, three, four, five.

254
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,557
This wallet's about to bust inside. I give
you five ones, you give me that $5 bill.

255
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:52,555
- How many grandchildren you got?
- I got two granddaughters, nine and ten,

256
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,029
two grandsons near 16

257
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,919
and I got a grandson 35 years old!

258
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,231
Come on! Why don't you
just give me a $10 bill?

259
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,949
Here's the five. The ones are there.
It won't be so quick to break.

260
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,749
- Six children!
- I got a daughter 51!

261
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:14,438
I don't mean to be handing you no line,
but that's pretty hard to believe.

262
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:18,673
- You can believe it all right!
- I'd have to see it. Much obliged.

263
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,678
- See you again!
- Y'all come back!

264
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,397
It just don't seem quite right.

265
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,993
Somehow.

266
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,194
- Yes?
- I'm looking for Mr Stanley.

267
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:52,797
- Mr Stanley's dead.
- I'm looking for Mr Warren M Stanley.

268
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,076
Warren's passed on, sir.

269
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:59,836
I was just talking to him not more than
two weeks back. He ordered this Bible.

270
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,230
He spent money on a Bible?

271
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:07,315
- Yes, with the name Elvira in the corner.
- Why would he buy a Bible?

272
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:12,634
He took fast to the idea. He left a
balance to it. Not counting the deposit...

273
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:16,156
- This one's already paid for!
- Huh?

274
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,835
Mr Stanley paid for the whole thing,
don't you remember?

275
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:37,590
- Afternoon, ma'am. Mr Huff at home?
- Mr Huff passed away a week ago.

276
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,479
Gee, I was talking to him a month ago.

277
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,952
- What was it you wanted?
- My name is Pray, Kansas Bible Co.

278
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,509
He ordered this Bible for Edna.

279
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:50,638
- That's my name.
- You don't have to take it.

280
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:56,033
- I'll give you back his deposit and...
- Of course I want to keep it.

281
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,111
He bought me a Bible.

282
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:02,398
I told him I could sell him a cheaper one,
but he wanted the best,

283
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,710
the best being the de luxe

284
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,111
with the name printed in gold letters,
bringing up a balance...

285
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,599
Of $24!

286
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,594
$24. I'll get my purse.
What's your name, honey?

287
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,513
- Addie.
- What a sweet little name.

288
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:21,037
- Addie Pray, ma'am.
- Addie Pray, I'm going to get you $24

289
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,510
and an extra five
for just coming to my door.

290
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:27,353
- Praise the Lord.
- Praise the Lord.

291
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:40,630
<i>Keep your sunny side up, up</i>

292
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,519
<i>Hide the side that gets blue</i>

293
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,109
- Let's give 'em some money.
- No.

294
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:03,477
Just a little bit. We got $305.16.

295
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,712
It's a whole other business giving it away.

296
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,394
- They're poorly!
- The whole country is.

297
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:13,235
- Frank Roosevelt said to care for people.
- I don't care about Roosevelt.

298
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:17,473
- He says it!
- That so? He's taking care of himself.

299
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:21,792
You think he don't eat off silver trays?
He could eat off table tops. He don't.

300
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:26,112
Because that would make him look
common. He ain't running this. I am.

301
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:29,317
- You don't say what we give away.
- It's mine, too.

302
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:32,358
- $200 belongs to me, don't forget.
- You want it?

303
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:37,310
Put my share in my pocket and I'll take
you to a train station. You like that?

304
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:44,153
Find out where the nearest depot is. First
you overcharge, then you give it away!

305
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,390
- Where are we?
- Plainville.

306
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:50,678
$12 for a Bible! Then it's up to $24!
If I stay with you, I'll end up in jail!

307
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:54,196
- You can take me to the Lincoln depot.
- You bet I will!

308
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,271
- Where's Lincoln?
- There.

309
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:00,638
- You think I'm taking you over there?
- We'll hit one in Sylvan Grove.

310
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,473
- Where's Sylvan Grove?
- Here.

311
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:06,552
- That's through Lucas.
- You got to go some way!

312
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:11,077
- I'm not complaining!
- You got to go through Waldo, Luray...

313
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:15,074
Luray? Those are pretty good towns.
We could do some business.

314
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:19,836
- We won't. We're nearly out of Bibles.
- What? Why didn't you tell me?

315
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,878
- You look in the box!
- You've always got an excuse.

316
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:26,396
- You always blame me!
- You should have told me!

317
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:30,951
- We're running out of Bibles!
- We got to get new ones in Great Bend.

318
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,954
- Great Bend's the other way.
- We got to have Bibles, don't we?

319
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:39,830
We can veer down to Lucas and Wilson.
Veer off to Lorraine and Bushton.

320
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,037
We could veer off to Hoisington.

321
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,078
Just have to keep on veering, that's all.

322
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,918
I'm getting hungry. You getting hungry?

323
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:35,358
<i>Sometimes I just don't know.</i>
<i>Keeping people with all the Doodley-do!</i>

324
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:40,436
You go on back now.
I'll see you another time.

325
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:46,709
- Don't send me back.
- You got to go. Another time, I promise.

326
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:53,117
What you trying to keep secret?
You got diamonds and rubies in there?

327
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:56,989
- Go on, go on.
- Old Fido! Night-night, old Fido!

328
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,957
- Woof!
- Woof, woof!

329
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,191
There it is!

330
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:50,080
- Much obliged.
- Thank you, sir.

331
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,071
All right, boy, you're next.

332
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,151
I ain't a boy!

333
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,232
- Don't let it bother you.
- It ain't funny.

334
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,870
- There's no reason to get that sore.
- He called me a boy.

335
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:11,079
- He just got mixed up, that's all.
- He looked me straight in the eye!

336
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:15,836
- So am I and I think you're beautiful.
- You're just saying that.

337
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,834
You're as beautiful as your mama
and she put every flower to shame.

338
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,312
They feared she'd droop the tulips in
Holland, and you got all her looks.

339
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,189
- Then how come he called me a boy?
- I don't know.

340
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:32,751
- Maybe it's 'cause of what you got on.
- What's wrong with it?

341
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:37,038
Nothing. It just... don't exactly
make you look feminine.

342
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:42,228
Maybe we should get you fixed up.
Get you a new dress, a fancy new hat.

343
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,198
It wouldn't exactly hurt business either.

344
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:49,114
- You really think I'm pretty as Mama?
- Course I do.

345
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:52,158
- How much money's in the box?
- $405.16.

346
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,437
- Give me a twenty.
- What for?

347
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,478
- Come on.
- Where?

348
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,712
To get us new outfits
with your money from Aunt Helen.

349
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:07,839
- I don't have no Aunt Helen.
- Sure you do. Let me explain it to you.

350
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,714
- Yes, sir?
- An Ipana toothpaste and Sen-Sen.

351
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,871
- 20 and 5.
- 25.

352
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,632
- Yes, sir.
- There.

353
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:28,232
75 makes 1, 4 makes 5
and 15 makes 20.

354
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:31,278
Thank you very much. I don't need a bag.

355
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,111
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you. Bye now!

356
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,430
- How much is this?
- 35 cents.

357
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:49,956
- 65 cents makes $1. Thank you.
- Thank you.

358
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,589
- Yes?
- A bottle of purple toilet water, please.

359
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,274
That'll be 25 cents.

360
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,791
There you go!

361
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,511
Lady, you made a mistake.

362
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,596
I give you $4.75.

363
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:22,435
- I gave you a $20 bill.
- You gave me a five.

364
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,636
No, ma'am, it was a $20 bill.

365
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:29,032
You give me a five and I give you $4.75.

366
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,868
It was a $20 bill.

367
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:38,235
No twenties in with no fives.

368
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:42,757
- What's all the turmoil?
- This girl gave me a $5 bill.

369
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:47,835
I gave her a $20 bill, I know I did. It was
a birthday present from my Aunt Helen.

370
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,437
She wrote "Happy Birthday, Addie"
on it. You just go look and see!

371
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:58,711
That's it, right there! That's my $20 bill
I got from my Aunt Helen!

372
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,474
- Give the child her $20 bill!
- I am.

373
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,870
- Give the child her $20.
- Yes, sir!

374
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,315
- And some candy.
- Yes, sir!

375
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,869
- And pay attention to things!
- Yes, sir!

376
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,030
Get your cotton candy!

377
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,589
Sweet hot cotton candy!

378
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,394
- Five cents.
- Do you have change for this five?

379
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:26,996
There you are, little girl. Cotton candy!
Cotton candy!

380
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:31,039
Mister, this purse is full. If you give me
a five, I'll give you five ones.

381
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,715
- Get your cotton candy right here!
- Mister!

382
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:41,479
Unless you've got a $10 bill? I'll give you
the five back, along with the five ones.

383
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,359
There. Now, don't bother me any more.

384
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:48,479
Cotton candy!
Step up and get your cotton candy!

385
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:08,352
Get your tickets for a fourth of a dollar!
The show goes on in five minutes!

386
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:11,830
Six unusual ladies
unveiling the secret of passion,

387
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,551
found only a few years back in the
Egyptian tomb of Queen Neferetti,

388
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:20,759
and featuring
the luscious Miss Trixie Delight!

389
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,269
- I had my photo took!
- You did?

390
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:27,079
- Come get a photo with me?
- Not now.

391
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:30,038
- It'll only take a minute!
- Not now!

392
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:33,431
- It won't be here after tonight!
- I can't help that.

393
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,751
- How many times will you see it?
- As many as I like.

394
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:40,469
- You've seen it half a dozen.
- I might see it more. Go play bingo.

395
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:44,030
- I don't want to.
- Write another love note to St Roosevelt.

396
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:47,112
- Maybe I will!
- Stop standing around checking on me.

397
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:51,239
I ain't about to leave some poor child
stranded. I got scruples, too.

398
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,868
- You know what that is, scruples?
- No.

399
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:59,068
But if you've got them, it's a sure
bet they belong to somebody else.

400
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:02,391
And his name ain't Frank! It's Franklin!

401
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:18,075
Hey there, I wondered where you got to.
Where's your pa?

402
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,232
- Is my picture ready?
- Sure. Excuse me, folks.

403
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,631
Sit back in the moon there.
I'll be right with you.

404
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:30,716
Here it is. Hey now, I thought you were
going to sit in the moon with your pa?

405
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,791
He ain't my pa!

406
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,190
Hi! Get ready! Smile!

407
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,316
Hold it, hold it!

408
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,038
Beautiful.

409
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,832
I don't want you smoking
in the car tomorrow.

410
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,356
- What?
- I didn't say nothing. I'm listening to you.

411
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:06,069
There'll be two extra people riding with us
and one don't like smoke.

412
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:09,232
- What extra person?
- What?

413
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,356
A lady I'm taking to Topeka.

414
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,876
- I didn't know we was going there.
- You don't know everything.

415
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,951
What's the lady's name?

416
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:19,839
Miss Delight. Miss Trixie Delight.

417
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,838
She's a real lady!
I'm just giving her a ride!

418
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,913
That's what you're always talking about,
helping other people out!

419
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:47,516
Don't drop nothing, Imogene.
Take care of those breakables.

420
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,830
Yes, Miss Trixie.

421
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,719
Morning! Car is right over here.

422
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,951
You better ride in the back.

423
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:05,432
Come on, Imogene, you don't want
to keep these nice people waiting.

424
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:21,553
Then I danced in Tuscaloosa and the
Mayor said the nicest things about me.

425
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:26,953
The newspaper ran a big photo on me.
I got a scrapbook on me from all over.

426
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:31,352
Tell him about the time that man tried
to crack your head with a bottle.

427
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:34,592
Imogene, you silly old thing.
You know that's not true.

428
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:38,719
He wasn't going to hit me with no bottle.
He was horsing around.

429
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,553
Ask me nice and I'll tell you about that.

430
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:44,951
Tell him about the time
you almost got thrown in jail.

431
00:39:55,200 --> 00:40:00,638
I don't understand it, Daddy. This little
baby has to go winky-tinky all the time.

432
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:05,794
- Don't worry. We'll stop here for dinner.
- We just stopped for her at lunch.

433
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:08,918
Right, and now
we're stopping for dinner. Come on.

434
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,991
I ain't hungry.

435
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,510
- Want one?
- OK.

436
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,719
- How old are you?
- I don't know, 15. Why?

437
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:33,395
- Just asking. Where are you from?
- Nowhere.

438
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:37,075
- You've got to be from somewheres.
- Down by Troy, I guess.

439
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,595
How long you work for her?

440
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:43,833
Ain't kept count. A year, maybe.
How old you be?

441
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,356
Nine. She really do all that dancing?

442
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,670
If you want to call it dancing.

443
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:53,310
All she do is waggle her hips
and shake her behind.

444
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,675
How come she leave that job?

445
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:58,877
The boss try to make her put out
for his friends.

446
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:02,510
- She don't put out for free.
- She put out much?

447
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:06,719
Like a gum machine. Drop something in
and she'll put something out.

448
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:10,236
- How much she charge?
- Most she can get.

449
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:15,030
But she always asks for $5.
She ain't putting out for your pa, though.

450
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,919
Says she's going to get all she can first.

451
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,991
He say he was my pa?

452
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:25,439
I heard him mumbling something like
he didn't want to talk about it. Ain't he?

453
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:29,593
I'm with him, ain't I?
How do you come to be with her?

454
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:33,958
She promised to give me $4 every week.
She ain't gave me nothing!

455
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,076
Except a nickel or dime.

456
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,310
Why don't you quit?

457
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:43,838
How I'm going to quit? And what if I do?
Ain't got no money to get home to Mom.

458
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,310
And what if I do get home?
They got hard times as it is.

459
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:52,315
My mama say, "Go work for a white
lady, she'll take good care of you."

460
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:57,315
Know what I think? You know that
white speck on top of chicken doo-doo?

461
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,914
That's the kind of white she is.

462
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:04,790
She's just like that little white speck
on top of old chicken shit!

463
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,711
I just love it, love it, love it!

464
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:16,512
All this white. It is absolutely the
proper thing for my kind of appearance.

465
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:21,196
You need a new dress. The right dress
makes all the difference in a face,

466
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:25,911
especially since you've got
the right kind of bone structure.

467
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,991
Oh my, oh my, Daddy,

468
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,869
but wouldn't you look handsome
behind the wheel of that?

469
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:34,429
Everything is in the bone structure.

470
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:37,637
A person can tell his whole life
by his bone structure.

471
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,711
I tried pushing her out of a window.

472
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:47,035
I think there are bugs all over. I just
hope there's no snakes round here.

473
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:50,078
I think we ought to go now, you know?

474
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,719
Thank you.

475
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:54,348
Now, hurry... Oh!

476
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:59,712
Come on, get those things in there.
Don't break anything, either.

477
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,678
- Let's go!
- Baby's got to go winky-tinky.

478
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,796
Don't worry.

479
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,270
Come on, we're ready.

480
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,476
- Come on!
- I ain't ready!

481
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:21,995
You don't look busy. Come on.

482
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,799
- I ain't coming!
- You listen here...

483
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,918
- No, I won't listen here!
- What's up with you?

484
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:31,868
I want to sit in front.
How come we ain't working no more?

485
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:37,478
We're on vacation. Miss Delight and me
are in front because we're grown-ups.

486
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:39,676
That's where grown-ups sit!

487
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:43,196
Children do not tell grown-ups
what to do with their lives.

488
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:47,035
She ain't my grown-up
and I ain't sitting no more in the back.

489
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,873
- Not for no cow!
- Keep your voice down!

490
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:53,749
Miss Delight ain't no cow.
She has a high school diploma!

491
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:57,037
And she's got to go to the bathroom,
so get to the car!

492
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:01,432
She's always in the bathroom!
She must have a bladder like a peanut.

493
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:06,310
I ain't getting back in that car
till she's out of it!

494
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:42,233
What's up? Daddy says you're
wearing a sad face. That ain't good.

495
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:46,029
How would you like a colouring book?
You like Mickey the Mouse?

496
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:48,475
Son of a bitch!

497
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:55,878
Come down to the car and let's all
be friends. You see me smile?

498
00:44:56,040 --> 00:45:01,273
Let's see you smile like Aunt Trixie.
Come on down with Mademoiselle.

499
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:10,198
Kiddo, I understand how you feel.
You don't have to worry.

500
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:14,876
One of these days you're going to be just
as pretty as Mademoiselle, maybe more.

501
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:19,352
You already got bone structure.
When I was your age, I didn't have any.

502
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:23,957
Took me years to get bone structure.
Don't think that's not important.

503
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:28,910
Nobody started to call me Mademoiselle
till I was 17 and getting bone structure.

504
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:33,198
At your age, I was skinny.
Never thought I'd have nothing up here.

505
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:36,591
You're going to have them up there, too.

506
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:41,038
Tell you what, want me to show you
how to use cosmetics?

507
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:45,432
I'll let you put on my earrings.
You'll see how pretty you're going to be.

508
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:49,354
I'll show you how to make up your eyes
and your lips.

509
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:52,432
I'll see to it you get a little bra,
or something.

510
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:55,319
Now, pick your ass up, sit in the back,

511
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:58,199
and cut out the crap, you understand?

512
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:12,558
You're going to ruin it, ain't you?

513
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:17,430
I don't want to wipe you out and I don't
want you wiping me out, you know?

514
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:20,512
So I'm going to level with you, OK?

515
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:24,468
With me, it's just a matter of time.
I don't know why,

516
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:28,679
but somehow I just don't manage
to hold on real long.

517
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:32,628
So, if you wait it out a little,
it'll be over, you know?

518
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:38,875
Even if I want a fella, somehow or
other I manage to get it screwed up.

519
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:43,830
Maybe I'll get a new pair of shoes,
a nice dress, a few laughs.

520
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,991
Times are hard.

521
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:50,919
If you fool around on the hill up here,
then you don't get nothing,

522
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:54,117
I don't get nothing, he don't get nothing.

523
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:59,954
So, how about it, honey?
Just for a little while?

524
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:03,476
Let old Trixie sit up front with her big tits.

525
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:15,232
Hey, come on!

526
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:21,513
We're coming, and if you don't
find me a gas station soon,

527
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:26,356
this little old snowflake's
going to wet her pantaloons!

528
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:28,875
Oh my, I almost fell down!
