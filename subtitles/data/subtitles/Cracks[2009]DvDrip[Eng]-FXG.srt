1
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,240
Miss G, I wanted to thank you
for lending me the book.

2
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:16,647
Did you read it?

3
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:18,264
Yes.

4
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:20,463
- Did you get caught?
- No.

5
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:23,165
And anyway, I'm not sure
what all the fuss is about.

6
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:24,962
I wasn't corrupted.

7
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:28,807
Good for you.
Let them put that in their pipes.

8
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:44,722
<i>* All things bright and beautiful</i>

9
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:48,525

00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:38,005

00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:41,440
<i>* The purple-headed mountain</i>

27
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:21,000
"I stole milk from breakfast
and made butter in an old cocoa tin."

28
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:25,719
But I'm going to share it with the team
so it's only half a sin, really.

29
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:32,044
And I had lustful thoughts
about the gardener's boy.

30
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:36,087
But he was only here for the summer
and I never even spoke to him.

31
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:39,258
Actually, I've...

32
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:42,448
had rather a lot of lustful thoughts.

33
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:45,360
Do I have to be sorry
for all of them?

34
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:49,759
1, 2, 3, 4, 5...

35
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:58,082
- Did you tell him?
- Yes.

36
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:00,007
- Everything?
- Not everything.

37
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:03,406
- Did you mention the book?
- And get Miss G into trouble?

38
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:06,169
They don't understand art
and culture.

39
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:09,327
It's stupid to ban books
that tell you the truth about life.

40
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:12,203
I don't think it's wrong
to want to know about the real world.

41
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:15,844
We can't stay pure forever.

42
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:19,686
Come on, Rosie.

43
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:22,363
I'm so hungry.

44
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:27,164
Excuse me. Coming through.

45
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:28,769
Excuse me.

46
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:30,926
I said excuse me!

47
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:34,569
Hello, team.

48
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:42,320
The new girl is arriving today.

49
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:53,688
Toast, fag.

50
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:55,368
Yes, Radfield?

51
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:58,481
Where's my butter?

52
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:00,888
On your toast.

53
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:05,284
Really? Where? Show me.

54
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:13,000
How generous of you!

55
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:18,602
It's funny. I go to all the trouble
making butter for the team,

56
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:21,244
and then I actually
expect to have it on my toast.

57
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:24,727
Sorry, captain.

58
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:27,282
Do it again.

59
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:31,926
From edge to edge. Or I'll have you
on a fork over that fire.

60
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:38,809
I have to set the standards,
or everything goes to hell.

61
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:40,729
Quick, she's coming.

62
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:47,841
We have a new girl coming all the way
from Spain to join your team.

63
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:53,441
And I want you to welcome her
on her arrival.

64
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:56,642
I know you are not always pleasant
to new girls,

65
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:59,238
but I want you to be particularly
nice to this girl

66
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:01,281
because she's travelling
such a distance,

67
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:04,288
from another country,
another background.

68
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:07,479
She's also a Roman Catholic,

69
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:10,647
but she will attend religious services
with the rest of you.

70
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,361
I want you to be kind.

71
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:18,409
This girl is an aristocrat.
She is accustomed to the best.

72
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:24,608
Yes, Miss Nieven.

73
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:27,605
- Do you all understand?
- Yes, Miss.

74
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:35,809
Bugger.

75
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:40,690
Roman Catholics are superstitious
and ignorant.

76
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:43,199
That's why they have
those ghastly pictures of Christ

77
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:45,969
bleeding with nails in his hands
and thorns on his head.

78
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:49,446
Catholic nuns bury their babies
in the backs of convent gardens.

79
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:53,483
And then they're walled in, standing up.
Can't even sit down to die!

80
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:04,768
- When's she arriving?
- I don't know and don't want to know.

81
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:08,448
I hear the Spaniard is a gymnast.

82
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:11,801
I hardly see the relevance
of cartwheels to what we do.

83
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:15,764
Miss G allowed it, so I don't want
to hear another word about it.

84
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:19,558
She's coming.

85
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:26,801
It's freezing in here!

86
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:29,125
What does Sunny Nieven do
with your parents' money?

87
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:32,598
It's not going on the heating,
that's for sure.

88
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:35,119
Must be throwing it away
on drink, girls?

89
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,965
Fuzzy, why are you hanging
like a sack of spuds?

90
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:40,603
I lost my bounce, Miss G.

91
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:42,925
Laurel, give her some bounce.

92
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:49,441
That's it. Feet together.

93
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:53,040
Arms straight, eyes forward.

94
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:56,958
You are sinew and muscle,
cutting through air and water.

95
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:58,842
With grace, with form,

96
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:01,043
with agility!

97
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:04,961
Fuzzy, you can do better than that.

98
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:08,844
I had seconds of porridge and toast
for breakfast and now I feel a bit queer.

99
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:10,369
Fuzzy.

100
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,721
Is that the most important thing
in life? Porridge?

101
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:16,410
- No, Miss G.
- Then what is?

102
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:21,370
- Think.
- God, Miss G.

103
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:25,768
- No. Rosie?
- Being kind to all God's creatures?

104
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:27,801
No, you're missing the point, dear.
Poppy?

105
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:30,842
- Death.
- In life, Poppy!

106
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:34,440
- Di?
- Desire, Miss G.

107
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:36,003
Yes! Thank you, Radfield!

108
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:40,766
The most important thing in life
is desire.

109
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:46,965
You can achieve anything you want.
The world is yours for the taking.

110
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:49,763
Nothing is impossible for you,
my girls.

111
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:52,484
All you need is to desire it.

112
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:55,965
- Do you have desire?
- Yes, Miss G.

113
00:08:56,650 --> 00:09:01,326
If you have desire, nothing can stand
in your way. Aim high!

114
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:15,489
'"We shall have a moment
of contemplation."

115
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:16,982
I think we should hear

116
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:21,082
Mr. Shelley's thoughts
on excessive ambition.

117
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:23,449
Poppy?

118
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:27,329
"I met a traveller
from an antique land

119
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:32,888
"who said: 2 vast and trunkless legs
of stone stand in the desert.

120

00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:38,409
Welcome!

133
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:42,447
It's a pleasure to have you with us, dear.
Did you have a good journey?

134
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:47,799
Come along.
Come along, George.

135
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:54,009
Come along, dear.

136
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,923
I pray the Lord my soul to keep,
and if I die before I wake...

137
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:30,839
strong conception that
I do groan withal. Thou art to die.

138
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:32,926
Then Lord have mercy on me!

139
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:36,326
- I say, amen!
- And have...

140
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:40,922
Look, new drip.

141
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:44,808
With staff.

142
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:49,361
See, she is a real princess!

143
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:07,558
Can't stop looking at her.
She's so beautiful.

144
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:10,488
She's not beautiful.
She's funny looking.

145
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:13,841
Her face is all lopsided.
Her features are too big.

146
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:19,561
Poppy, you're prettier.

147
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:38,444
- I'm Di Radfield. I'm your captain.
- Fiamma Coronna.

148
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:42,370
You may have 5 things
on your nightstand.

149
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:44,287
Then I shall do my very best.

150
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:49,842
These are the rules.

151
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:51,688
5 things.

152
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:53,719
Listen.

153
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:58,448
It's the sound of the world ending.

154
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:08,320
During your brief stay with us,
Your Highness, the rules are:

155
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:11,203
you must do up the top button
of your shirt when wearing your tie,

156
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:15,209
and you must ask a teacher
or a prefect if you wish to remove it.

157
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:19,323
You may wear mufti on Sundays
after chapel and before high tea.

158
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:24,126
And you are allowed
5 personal objects on display.

159
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,129
The rules are for everyone.

160
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:32,320
No exceptions, no favourites, no pets.

161
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:36,005
What a cow!

162
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:56,849
Mummy. Mummy.

163
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:59,438
Mummy! Mummy!

164
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:10,208
Do you want to wake the others?

165
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:14,646
There's nothing wrong with you.
Go to sleep.

166
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:16,726
I thought I heard my mother
calling my name.

167
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:20,320
I thought she'd come to get me.
Thought I was going home.

168
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:08,639
Whoever you are, you're late.

169
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:10,806
- That's Fiamma.
- The aristocrat.

170
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:13,563
Should I curtsey?

171
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:17,208
Why are you late, Fiamma?

172
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:20,640
It is not late.
It is not even 7.

173
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:24,445
We'll see if you were worth
waiting for, then.

174
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:57,602
Radfield sets the standard!

175
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:07,001
What went through your head
as you did that?

176
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:10,566
- Nothing. My mind went blank.
- Exactly!

177
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:13,124
This is why we train, girls.

178
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:17,687
The body learns, it memorises.
Your muscles know how to respond.

179
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:21,883
Then you release your body
from your mind. It's purely physical.

180
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:26,367
But there is poetry in such perfection.

181
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:30,283
Right. Who wants to go next?

182
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:33,049
Fuzzy.

183
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:43,200
What's the matter with you, Fuzzy?

184
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:45,767
Thinking about the boys again?

185
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:48,563
No, I'm thinking about my dive.

186
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:50,408
Don't think! Do!

187
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:06,608
Fuzzy!

188
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:17,249
Fiamma?

189
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:22,002
It's too cold to dive.
Too cold to swim.

190
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:24,405
It's not too cold for my girls.

191
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:28,921
- This is winter in Spain.
- But this isn't Spain, is it?

192
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:32,880
What are you afraid of?
Not as good as you look, perhaps?

193
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:29,726
- Amazing!
- Well done, Fiamma.

194
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:45,649
It seems the bar has been raised,
Radfield.

195
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:55,289
Come on, Fiamma.

196
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:58,402
Fiamma, we're your horses,
so you have to feed us.

197
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:02,160
- Tally-ho!
- Wait for me.

198
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:05,362
Apparently, Miss G has ended
her affair with Mr. Du Toit.

199
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:07,401
He's one of the fathers.

200
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:09,919
She wasn't in love with him,
it was purely physical.

201
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:12,723
- They were driven by their lust.
- Is that true?

202
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:15,444
It's absolute tosh.
Lily, stop making a show of yourself.

203
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:19,358
And I saw Mr. Du Toit once.
He was very handsome.

204
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:21,162
Like a movie star.

205
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:23,764
He had big strong hands and blue eyes

206
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:26,364
that promised wild adventures.

207
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:28,287
So really, it's entirely possible

208
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:30,878
that he and Miss G could have
given in to their desire.

209
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:32,648
I quite fancied him for myself.

210
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:35,842
Because older men know all
about female sexual ecstasy.

211
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:39,087
Lily, I think one day
you shall have a first in sex.

212
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:43,369
What's that?

213
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:46,527
For my breathing.
It clears the passages.

214
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:55,166
It smells.
Like my grandmother's linen drawer.

215
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:57,809
Come on, Rosie.

216
00:20:57,930 --> 00:20:59,648
You've got the black spot.

217
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:01,523
On your head.

218
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:02,799
Black spot.

219
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:06,963
- Didn't you notice?
- So what?

220
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:09,160
It means you're going to die.

221
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:11,963
I'd better go back
to the school then.

222
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:18,840
She's obviously never read
"Treasure Island".

223
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:21,279
She has no idea what you're on about.

224
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:22,889
Poppy!

225
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:26,047
Ooh-ah, it weren't me and
you can't prove a thing.

226
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:30,925
Ooh-ah, mind my peg-leg.

227
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:33,041
And my parrot.

228
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:11,481
Spelling.

229
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:14,928
Spelling.

230
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:18,802
Fuzzy, grammar.

231
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:25,086
- She reads our letters?
- Of course. What did you think?

232
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:30,320
- Who's Pablo?
- A friend.

233
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:34,329
- A boyfriend?
- A boy and a friend.

234
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:37,886
- A prince?
- No. Regrettably.

235
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:41,685
- Is that why you were banished?
- I was not banished.

236
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:45,405
- Like Romeo and Juliet?
- Do it again.

237
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:49,125
- And don't sound so down in the dumps.
- Yes, Miss.

238
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:51,445
Letters are greetings.

239
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:55,245
Use this opportunity
to show your dear parents

240
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:57,930
your fine penmanship
and turn of phrase.

241
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:02,445
Don't harry them for tuck
and pocket money.

242
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:05,645
- Is that for me?
- No.

243
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:07,203
Are you sure?
I think I can see my name.

244
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:08,729
No. Shoo. Go on, off with you.

245
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:14,527
Persephone Burls?

246
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:21,687
Fuzzy, for you, I think.

247
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:24,722
- Can't make head nor tail of the stamps.
- They're Egyptian.

248
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:33,088
Fiamma Coronna.

249
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:36,088
You see? You haven't been forgotten.

250
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:38,087
That's all, I'm afraid, girls.

251
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:40,599
But I'm sure Fiamma won't mind
sharing her treasures.

252
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:44,438
"Dear Persephone,
hope you're well and studying hard.

253
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:47,482
"Daddy's taking up his post in Rhodesia
a week earlier than expected..."

254
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:49,362
Aren't you going to open it, then?

255
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:56,045
- Here?
- Come on, show us. Let's see.

256
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:12,649
Look at this!

257
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:19,448
Go on.

258
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:24,281
This is heaven.

259
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:29,120
Fiamma, tell me the story again.

260
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:32,324
- I told you last night.
- I like it. Please.

261
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:33,565
Please.

262
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:38,644
There once was a king
and his beloved daughter.

263
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:42,968
Together they explored distant lands.

264
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:46,241
One day,
they encountered a sultan

265
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:49,999
who offered the king
an extraordinary gift

266
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:53,884
in return for his daughter's hand.

267
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:56,843
A magical blue diamond.

268
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:01,248
But the king was greedy

269
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:03,281
and took both,

270
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:08,040
the diamond and the Princess
back to his mighty castillo.

271
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:11,446
But the Sultan came looking
for the Princess

272
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:15,927
and begged her to fly away with him

273
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:19,122
on a magical tapestry of silk.

274
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:30,609
And the Princess was so intoxicated

275
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:34,040
that she flew away with him

276
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:37,727
never to be seen again.

277
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:27,241
Can't sleep, Di?

278
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:31,008
I was thinking of home.

279
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:41,404
Would be a shame to waste
such a beautiful night.

280
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:44,203
Come on. We're going swimming.
Wake the others.

281
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:47,209
Lily.

282
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:53,207
- Laurel, wake up.
- Wake up. We're going swimming.

283
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:56,639
Don't be ridiculous.
It's the middle of the night.

284
00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:59,682
It's a compulsory lesson.
You can't bunk. Get up!

285
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:03,246
What lesson?
What are you talking about?

286
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:52,921
What are you waiting for?
Kingdom come?

287
00:28:57,490 --> 00:28:58,445
Lily!

288
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,729
I'll splash you.

289
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:26,087
- Got to swim faster than that.
- You're mother!

290
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:28,565
- How do I play?
- Chase the mother fish. Chase Di.

291
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:30,203
You're mother.

292
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:36,599
- Who's mother now?
- You're mother.

293
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:00,041
Miss G learnt this game in India.

294
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:05,959
Really? I love India.
When were you there?

295
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:07,318
A few years ago.

296
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:11,079
Miss G, tell Fiamma about
how you rode on elephants with rajas!

297
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:14,486
Di, we've all heard that story before.

298
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:16,646
I'd rather hear
about Fiamma's adventures.

299
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:21,048
I haven't had adventures.
I just travelled with my father.

300
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:22,649
Miss G travelled alone.

301
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:25,158
Really?

302
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:28,248
I was a bit of a scandal in my day.

303
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:30,804
I remember one captain
who was quite loath

304
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:33,364
to having an unaccompanied woman
on board.

305
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:37,722
It caused such a stir, I was forced
to disembark at the next port.

306
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:43,648
Where else have you been, Fiamma?

307
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:49,565
Abyssinia, Somaliland, the Dodecanese.

308
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:51,442
And Paris.

309
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:53,686
Paris is filthy.

310
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:58,800
Do you care for Paris?

311
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:02,046
I love to travel.

312
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:06,561
One day I shall have to resume
my exploration of the world.

313
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:08,920
It's in our blood, isn't it?

314
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:13,882
You're not like the other girls.

315
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:17,207
They're still waiting
for their lives to begin.

316
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:19,207
But not you.

317
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:26,241
But you can go whenever you choose.

318
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:31,609
Why do you stay?

319
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:36,489
I stay for my girls, of course.

320
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:42,163
When they leave, so shall I.

321
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:33,840
This is out of bounds, Miss Gribben.

322
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:38,400
I had no idea. Nothing is locked.

323
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:42,921
It is an honour system.
We respect confidentiality here.

324
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:44,847
And I thought
you would have known that.

325
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:50,206
Quite a scandal though, wasn't it?

326
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:54,323
A countess stealing away with
a peasant. And a Marxist, to boot!

327
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:57,123
Imagine the daring, the courage.

328
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:59,844
That is neither here nor there.

329
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:04,441
We have had to protect many girls
from themselves over the years.

330
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:09,086
I just felt if I knew a little of her
history, I could be of more help.

331
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:14,961
All our girls are to be treated equally,
regardless of their past.

332
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:17,365
As you well know, Miss Gribben.

333
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:22,239
You have been with us a long time.

334
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:28,648
I'm sorry, Miss Nieven.

335
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:31,443
It was an error of judgement.
It won't happen again.

336
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:33,959
See that it doesn't.

337
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:38,644
The world is a perilous place.

338
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:42,729
It would be a shame for you
to have to find that out firsthand.

339
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:15,369
So have you decided?
Is it a centre-piece for a dinner party?

340
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:19,203
Or a christening?

341
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:23,528
Or a simple 'get well' arrangement
for an ailing relative.

342
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:28,280
Or have you any ideas of your own?
You can be creative.

343
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:34,527
The world falls at her feet
because she's an aristocrat.

344
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:38,086
It's so unjust. So unearned.

345
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:43,919
Fuzzy Burls, what have you done?

346
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:46,245
Fuzzy never gets any help.

347
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:52,278
Did you hear? Your father
called for you on the telephone.

348
00:34:52,410 --> 00:34:55,527
- My father?
- The prince himself.

349
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:56,969
Why wasn't I told?

350
00:34:57,090 --> 00:34:59,558
God knows where you were.
We looked everywhere for you.

351
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:02,762
- In the end he had to speak to Lily.
- What did he say?

352
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:06,519
Well... I think he took
quite a shine to Lily.

353
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:09,961
He's arranged to see her next week.

354
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:12,729
He's sending a carriage
and champagne for her.

355
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:16,601
Your father's a randy bugger, Fiamma.

356
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:20,006
He's going to deflower
our precious Lily.

357
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:22,801
You shouldn't be cruel.

358
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:28,688
Excuse me, Miss Cairns.

359
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:31,483
I was wondering if I might take
advantage of the glorious sunshine

360
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:34,124
and steal the girls away
for a dive.

361
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:35,319
By all means.

362
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:39,842
Fiamma, dear?

363
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:44,204
If you don't mind, Miss Cairns,
I wish to stay.

364
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:49,080
Fiamma, the great British summertime
rarely indulges us.

365
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:54,330
It is barely past lunch.
I will get a cramp and sink like a stone.

366
00:35:58,370 --> 00:35:59,359
Suit yourself.

367
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:01,929
Girls.

368
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:17,442
Last dive, girls.

369
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:21,085
Show me something interpretive.

370
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:24,600
"Puttin' On The Ritz"

371
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:28,587
- Come on, be sexy, girls!
- Look, Miss G.

372
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:34,241
- Well done, Fuzzy.
- Elephant. Poodle.

373
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:37,844
Chicken dance.

374
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:35,241
No textbooks today, girls.

375
00:37:54,370 --> 00:37:55,849
Ta-da!

376
00:37:57,490 --> 00:38:01,324
- Look at this!
- Look at this hat.

377
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:43,642
Now, a story about Africa, I think.

378
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:47,848
The last remains of the First Mate.

379
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:51,958
Mr. Riley I believe his name was.

380
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:55,685
He died in a mandrake swamp
on the way to the Congo Français.

381
00:38:55,810 --> 00:38:57,528
Poor Mr. Riley.

382
00:38:57,650 --> 00:38:59,527
We were touring in a steamer,

383
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:04,041
but he wanted to take a canoe
and explore deeper into the lagoon.

384
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:08,607
A fascinating pursuit, but a pleasure
to be indulged with caution,

385
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:11,085
for you are certain
to come across crocodiles.

386
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:15,959
Taken, he was,
right out of the canoe.

387
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:20,481
It was a case of
'here one minute, gone the next'.

388
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:26,847
Foolish man.

389
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:32,921
Probably spent his last moments
wondering why,

390
00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:34,881
having reached this point of folly...

391
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:36,648
he need have gilded the lily

392
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:40,126
by fooling around in mangrove
swamps.

393
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:49,248
You must have heard me
tell this one before.

394
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:51,969
I believe I must.

395
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:59,408
Nevertheless...we...

396
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:02,286
we pushed on towards
the Ogowe River...

397
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:07,168
plagued by mandrake flies.

398
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:09,884
The stench of the swamp...

399
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:12,843
Fairy tales. Like all her stories.

400
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:16,240
Now not only are there crocodiles...

401
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:18,008
Miss G has risked it all.

402
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:23,766
She's fearless and true
and an example to everyone of us.

403
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:28,008
I think you'll find Mary Kingsley
risked it all in 1897.

404
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:31,006
A bestseller, I think.

405
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:33,690
It was certainly translated into Spanish.

406
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:40,006
...to exit and begin its external life.

407
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:47,684
Come on, Laurel, you can do it.

408
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:52,523
Come on, Poppy!

409
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:57,959
Fantastic, Laurel.

410
00:40:58,090 --> 00:40:59,967
Well done, Laurel.

411
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:43,008
Where's your courage?

412
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:47,280
Why? Why can't you give your all?

413
00:41:47,410 --> 00:41:50,163
Where is your poetry? Your passion?

414
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:53,241
Why do I bother?

415
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:56,482
Fiamma.

416
00:41:56,610 --> 00:41:58,407
We're not finished.

417
00:41:59,010 --> 00:42:00,807
Can we have another go, too?

418
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:04,286
No. Fiamma has another dive in her.

419
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:08,043
We shall all wait until she finds it.

420
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:16,049
Fiamma.

421
00:43:05,610 --> 00:43:08,647
Where is she? Has she drowned?

422
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:11,648
I'm not going to save her.

423
00:43:11,770 --> 00:43:14,204
She'll pop up like a cork
in a minute.

424
00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:18,403
Fiamma has an intrepid spirit.
Real mettle in her soul.

425
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:23,609
Imagine possessing what she has.

426
00:43:23,730 --> 00:43:27,962
How different
to this dull, aching existence.

427
00:43:28,770 --> 00:43:32,365
Only Fiamma is willing to risk it all.

428
00:43:32,490 --> 00:43:35,323
To push herself beyond her boundaries.

429
00:43:42,970 --> 00:43:45,325
You may go and get changed.

430
00:43:50,610 --> 00:43:52,726
Circuits for the rest of you.

431
00:43:52,850 --> 00:43:54,442
It's not fair.

432
00:44:17,650 --> 00:44:19,925
That was top-notch today, Fiamma.

433
00:44:20,050 --> 00:44:22,564
Don't feel bad for the others,
you can't help being the best.

434
00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:30,127
We have a great deal in common,
you know.

435
00:44:33,850 --> 00:44:37,206
We have experienced so much,
you and I.

436
00:44:37,330 --> 00:44:38,968
So much the same.

437
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:46,729
There's no reason why we shouldn't
be the best of friends.

438
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:03,204
I don't understand
why we were punished with circuits.

439
00:45:03,330 --> 00:45:07,209
I did my best dive today,
and Miss G didn't even notice.

440
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:10,163
- I thought Laurel was very brave.
- Thank you.

441
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:14,727
- So why are we in trouble?
- Fiamma set the standard.

442
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:19,082
So? When you set the standard,
we weren't made to suffer.

443
00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:51,323
- What are you doing?
- We're drawing from life.

444
00:45:51,890 --> 00:45:54,802
- Has anyone seen Fiamma?
- No.

445
00:45:56,370 --> 00:45:59,009
Have you not seen her anywhere?

446
00:45:59,770 --> 00:46:01,681
She's been in a bate
since this morning.

447
00:46:01,810 --> 00:46:05,439
- I thought it was more of a wuss.
- No, definitely a bate.

448
00:46:07,210 --> 00:46:09,360
Did you try the library
or the rough patch?

449
00:46:09,490 --> 00:46:11,481
I've done that twice now.

450
00:46:12,290 --> 00:46:13,609
Twice...

451
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:22,083
We should help look for her,
I suppose.

452
00:46:23,770 --> 00:46:25,681
Come on.

453
00:46:28,290 --> 00:46:29,723
We're on a mission for Miss G!

454
00:46:29,850 --> 00:46:33,286
But it's so hot.
Can't we just stay here?

455
00:46:34,730 --> 00:46:36,686
Fine. I'll go on my own, then.

456
00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:02,686
Look, over there!

457
00:47:08,930 --> 00:47:10,124
There you are.

458
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:13,366
Quite elusive today, aren't you?

459
00:47:14,090 --> 00:47:16,081
Why must you follow me?

460
00:47:18,650 --> 00:47:20,800
We didn't finish
our conversation yesterday.

461
00:47:22,290 --> 00:47:24,201
I've nothing to say to you.

462
00:47:25,930 --> 00:47:27,488
I see.

463
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:33,888
You know, you really should make
more of an effort to fit in.

464
00:47:34,010 --> 00:47:36,729
I will not be here
long enough to fit in.

465
00:47:39,770 --> 00:47:41,681
My father will come and get me.

466
00:47:42,650 --> 00:47:44,208
Of course, dear.

467
00:47:44,890 --> 00:47:47,279
But, you see, Laurel came for a term.

468
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:51,361
So did Rosie. Fuzzy thought
she was going to be a day girl.

469
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:54,050
Only Di realised this is forever.

470
00:48:00,610 --> 00:48:02,805
It is not forever.

471
00:48:02,930 --> 00:48:04,409
They will leave you.

472
00:48:20,290 --> 00:48:22,281
...and a loaf for Matron, please.

473
00:48:24,970 --> 00:48:28,042
4 sugared rolls, 3 jam tarts
and a loaf for Matron, please.

474
00:48:28,170 --> 00:48:29,649
4 sugared rolls, 3 jam tarts...

475
00:48:50,290 --> 00:48:52,850
4 sugared rolls, 3 jam tarts
and a loaf for Matron.

476
00:48:54,010 --> 00:48:57,559
4 sugared rolls, 3 jam tarts
and a loaf for Matron, please.

477
00:49:15,730 --> 00:49:17,049
Can I help you?

478
00:49:17,170 --> 00:49:20,480
4 sugared rolls, 3 jam tarts
and a loaf for Matron, please.

479
00:49:34,370 --> 00:49:36,042
Will that be all, Miss?

480
00:49:39,330 --> 00:49:40,479
Miss?

481
00:49:42,170 --> 00:49:46,163
And a...a quarter of lemon sherbets,
please.

482
00:50:44,610 --> 00:50:47,329
I hope this makes
the homesickness go away.

483
00:50:50,490 --> 00:50:53,482
Nothing worse than feeling all alone
somewhere foreign.

484
00:50:54,490 --> 00:50:56,003
I know that feeling.

485
00:50:56,130 --> 00:51:00,089
And I know how important
even a small kindness can be.

486
00:51:02,930 --> 00:51:04,761
Fuzzy?

487
00:51:04,890 --> 00:51:08,644
I don't think that's a good idea, Burls.
You make too big a splash as it is.

488
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:16,565
It's not fair.

489
00:51:21,210 --> 00:51:24,441
Please. Help yourselves.

490
00:51:41,490 --> 00:51:43,287
What good is that going to do, Rosie?

491
00:51:43,410 --> 00:51:45,480
I don't have any money.

492
00:51:45,610 --> 00:51:47,328
Give us one of your shortbreads, then.

493
00:51:49,290 --> 00:51:53,203
Rosie, this is deadly serious.
Do as you are told.

494
00:52:05,210 --> 00:52:06,928
Good riddance!

495
00:52:17,850 --> 00:52:19,329
Come on.

496
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:23,966
Right, let's find Fiamma.

497
00:52:37,730 --> 00:52:39,209
Get up!

498
00:52:40,010 --> 00:52:41,489
You're going home.

499
00:52:52,650 --> 00:52:54,447
There's food, money and a map.

500
00:52:54,570 --> 00:52:57,607
There's a ferry that leaves in an hour
so you need to get a move on.

501
00:52:57,730 --> 00:53:00,324
You do want to go home, don't you?

502
00:53:00,450 --> 00:53:04,489
Back to your villa and boyfriend
and the diamonds and parties?

503
00:53:05,730 --> 00:53:07,800
Thank you. I do.

504
00:53:15,490 --> 00:53:19,278
Don't come back!
I mean it, don't you ever come back!

505
00:53:27,250 --> 00:53:32,040
<i>* Your vows you've broken like my heart</i>

506
00:53:32,170 --> 00:53:36,721
<i>* Oh why did you so enrapture me?</i>

507
00:53:38,290 --> 00:53:42,602
<i>* Now I remain in a world apart</i>

508
00:53:42,730 --> 00:53:47,485
<i>* Though my heart
remains in captivity</i>

509
00:53:50,210 --> 00:53:52,599
Bath night for Fuzzy,
Laurel and Fiamma.

510
00:54:00,690 --> 00:54:03,284
- Where is Fiamma Coronna?
- I'll have her bath!

511
00:54:03,410 --> 00:54:05,128
No, you won't, Poppy.

512
00:54:05,770 --> 00:54:07,488
Where is Fiamma?

513
00:54:08,650 --> 00:54:10,288
Don't know, Matron.

514
00:54:12,370 --> 00:54:14,042
Hiding in the rose garden?

515
00:54:15,850 --> 00:54:17,169
Di Radfield, where is she?

516
00:54:18,370 --> 00:54:22,363
I have no idea, Matron.
She's a law unto herself.

517
00:54:23,930 --> 00:54:28,242
<i>* And that yet once before I die...</i>

518
00:54:29,970 --> 00:54:33,280
We have not had
an event like this in all my time.

519
00:54:33,410 --> 00:54:36,686
Our reputation is at stake.
Our own good name.

520
00:54:36,810 --> 00:54:38,562
I blame myself.
I have been too lenient.

521
00:54:38,690 --> 00:54:41,443
In many ways the diving team
has been a great success.

522
00:54:41,570 --> 00:54:45,609
I do not wish to diminish
your great achievements with these girls

523
00:54:45,730 --> 00:54:48,961
when I say that they lack
a sense of proportion.

524
00:54:49,090 --> 00:54:52,560
Fiamma must learn that she is
no more special than any other child.

525
00:54:52,690 --> 00:54:54,248
I'll use a firmer hand.

526
00:54:54,370 --> 00:54:58,045
Good. Now we must pray this child
returns to us unharmed.

527
00:54:58,890 --> 00:55:01,563
- Try it again, please.
- "Very well."

528
00:55:09,130 --> 00:55:12,042
<i>"There's still no answer.
May I suggest you try later?"</i>

529
00:55:12,170 --> 00:55:16,083
I have to speak to him.
He has to come and get me.

530
00:55:16,650 --> 00:55:18,288
<i>"Please try again later."</i>

531
00:55:46,130 --> 00:55:49,520
- Last crossing, Miss.
- No, thank you.

532
00:55:51,610 --> 00:55:53,601
I don't care for open water.

533
00:56:01,530 --> 00:56:03,009
Come.

534
00:56:04,810 --> 00:56:06,038
Miss G?

535
00:56:06,170 --> 00:56:09,321
We were all wondering
if there was any news.

536
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:11,680
News? No.

537
00:56:14,210 --> 00:56:16,041
Perhaps she's returned to Spain.

538
00:56:17,210 --> 00:56:21,169
How foolish if she has.
No one is missing her there.

539
00:56:24,890 --> 00:56:26,608
Why are you cross?

540
00:56:27,570 --> 00:56:30,289
I thought the team would be
better off without her.

541
00:56:31,410 --> 00:56:33,207
Well, you thought wrong!

542
00:56:35,130 --> 00:56:38,281
And when I want your opinion,
I'll ask for it.

543
00:57:16,010 --> 00:57:18,808
I don't think we need
to pursue this matter.

544
00:57:18,930 --> 00:57:20,886
She must've been
out in the cold for hours.

545
00:57:21,010 --> 00:57:25,322
We found her by the side of the road.
She was in such a state, poor girl.

546
00:57:27,730 --> 00:57:28,958
She's back!

547
00:57:29,890 --> 00:57:32,165
They caught her dodging a bus fare
on the mainland.

548
00:57:36,490 --> 00:57:37,559
Girls!

549
00:57:38,610 --> 00:57:39,599
Lights out!

550
00:57:57,570 --> 00:58:00,448
I'm really glad you came back.

551
00:58:22,890 --> 00:58:25,199
Fiamma! Come on, Fiamma!

552
00:58:39,370 --> 00:58:40,849
Amazing!

553
00:58:46,850 --> 00:58:48,841
Go on, Fuzzy.

554
00:58:49,690 --> 00:58:51,758
Girls, we are...

555
00:58:52,350 --> 00:58:54,058
angels,

556
00:58:54,350 --> 00:58:55,708
eagles.

557
00:58:56,890 --> 00:58:58,369
To dive is to fly.

558
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:11,968
Set yourself free of the shackles
of conformity.

559
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:16,481
Let nothing hold you back
except the air itself.

560
00:59:26,370 --> 00:59:29,885
You are between heaven and earth.

561
00:59:30,010 --> 00:59:32,319
The rules no longer apply.

562
00:59:48,290 --> 00:59:51,327
I'm bored of practice.
When do we compete?

563
00:59:53,290 --> 00:59:56,123
We can have a little competition now
if you like.

564
00:59:56,250 --> 00:59:59,686
No, I want to compete
against another team.

565
00:59:59,810 --> 01:00:01,368
Radfield, pick a team.

566
01:00:01,490 --> 01:00:02,764
Lily.

567
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:04,721
Fiamma, you can be captain of team B.
Your turn to choose.

568
01:00:04,850 --> 01:00:05,839
Pick me!

569
01:00:05,970 --> 01:00:08,564
Real competitions.
Against other schools.

570
01:00:08,690 --> 01:00:11,250
With prizes and trophies.

571
01:00:11,370 --> 01:00:14,089
You do have trophies?

572
01:00:14,210 --> 01:00:16,849
- Miss G?
- We're training to compete.

573
01:00:16,970 --> 01:00:19,438
How many meets have you attended
with this team?

574
01:00:21,090 --> 01:00:22,409
None.

575
01:00:22,530 --> 01:00:24,168
None?

576
01:00:24,930 --> 01:00:26,079
We have never competed.

577
01:00:27,250 --> 01:00:28,399
You've never been ready.

578
01:00:30,810 --> 01:00:33,608
- But I feel ready.
- I feel ready, too.

579
01:00:33,730 --> 01:00:35,686
What's the point if we don't compete?

580
01:00:35,810 --> 01:00:38,449
I won't tolerate a mutiny.

581
01:00:38,570 --> 01:00:42,040
Since Fiamma seems to know what's
best for you, let her take the reins!

582
01:01:29,050 --> 01:01:32,008
You shouldn't be so bloody superior
all the time.

583
01:01:32,130 --> 01:01:35,406
You're making her miserable, you know.
And ruining the team.

584
01:01:36,810 --> 01:01:38,687
If we're to be lumbered with you,

585
01:01:38,810 --> 01:01:42,166
you have to learn the happiness of the
team is more important than your own.

586
01:01:42,290 --> 01:01:45,282
I have no interest
in being part of your team.

587
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:48,049
I'm not even meant to be here.

588
01:01:49,570 --> 01:01:50,889
Well, you're here now!

589
01:01:51,010 --> 01:01:54,889
So you had better make the best of it
and stop being so bloody selfish.

590
01:01:55,010 --> 01:01:58,719
I'm not selfish.
I just want to go home.

591
01:01:58,850 --> 01:02:01,569
Don't you think
we all want to go home?

592
01:03:14,130 --> 01:03:15,927
You can keep it if you like.

593
01:03:24,650 --> 01:03:26,129
Thank you.

594
01:03:33,490 --> 01:03:36,163
Maybe if I were kinder to Miss G,

595
01:03:36,290 --> 01:03:38,406
she would be kinder to you.

596
01:03:42,290 --> 01:03:43,609
Maybe.

597
01:03:45,490 --> 01:03:46,969
I will try.

598
01:03:48,170 --> 01:03:49,967
No promises.

599
01:04:10,290 --> 01:04:12,599
Dreg in a midge wig.

600
01:04:15,490 --> 01:04:18,050
I'm bored. What should we do?

601
01:04:18,170 --> 01:04:20,206
We could play hide and seek?
Piggy in the middle?

602
01:04:20,330 --> 01:04:21,206
Red Rover?

603
01:04:21,330 --> 01:04:25,243
We should do something fun
for a change. Like a midnight feast.

604
01:04:26,490 --> 01:04:29,721
Fiamma, do you have
a suggestion for us?

605
01:04:34,770 --> 01:04:36,647
The feast of St. Agnes.

606
01:04:37,930 --> 01:04:42,526
On St. Agnes Eve, if a woman
performs certain divinations,

607
01:04:42,650 --> 01:04:46,120
she will see a vision
of her future husband

608
01:04:46,250 --> 01:04:48,480
and he will eat and drink with her.

609
01:04:50,090 --> 01:04:53,207
- Divinations are ungodly.
- Rosie, it's Keats.

610
01:04:53,330 --> 01:04:56,640
Brilliant! Some of us can be Madeline
and some Porphyro.

611
01:04:56,770 --> 01:04:58,920
We can dress up and have
a beadsman and a baledown.

612
01:04:59,050 --> 01:05:02,201
- Someone can hobble around.
- I'll be Porphyro with his steed.

613
01:05:02,330 --> 01:05:06,118
I'll be Madeline and pray
for a dream lover in the moonlight.

614
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:10,038
Then it's decided.
Everyone must bring food.

615
01:05:10,170 --> 01:05:12,320
And we shall need flowers
for our hair.

616
01:05:12,450 --> 01:05:14,361
We're going to have so much fun.
You'll see.

617
01:05:18,610 --> 01:05:21,124
Then, of course,
the 5th form was just lovely,

618
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:24,242
lashings and lashings of cut flowers.

619
01:06:05,090 --> 01:06:07,046
- Have I missed it?
- Come on, it's starting.

620
01:06:10,930 --> 01:06:14,002
Those are good.
Will you help with the Madelines?

621
01:06:16,370 --> 01:06:17,689
Somebody do my hair.

622
01:06:19,930 --> 01:06:21,966
Everyone looks so marvellous.

623
01:06:26,810 --> 01:06:28,801
It's like that.

624
01:06:37,490 --> 01:06:38,479
Bless you.

625
01:07:11,090 --> 01:07:14,048
- How do I look?
- Exquisite.

626
01:07:14,730 --> 01:07:17,449
Di, come over here.

627
01:07:29,290 --> 01:07:32,009
Even more tinned peaches!

628
01:07:35,850 --> 01:07:38,239
Laurel, can I have one
of your toffees, please?

629
01:07:39,530 --> 01:07:42,044
I could not get to sleep.
I just couldn't sleep.

630
01:07:46,770 --> 01:07:48,249
Rosie!

631
01:07:50,970 --> 01:07:53,530
Fiamma, you've kissed a boy,
haven't you?

632
01:07:53,650 --> 01:07:54,844
I have.

633
01:07:54,970 --> 01:07:57,359
Tell me how to do it. In detail.

634
01:07:57,490 --> 01:08:00,288
It can't be taught. You must practise
on the back of your hand.

635
01:08:01,130 --> 01:08:03,883
Or on the gardener's boy!

636
01:08:05,570 --> 01:08:07,128
Such amateurs.

637
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:09,889
Listen, it's all very well to moon
after a pash,

638
01:08:10,010 --> 01:08:13,639
but there comes a time
when you have to grow up

639
01:08:13,770 --> 01:08:15,840
and find a proper man
and get your knickers off!

640
01:08:21,450 --> 01:08:23,645
Because you know all about that,
don't you, Lily?

641
01:08:23,770 --> 01:08:25,203
Fuzzy!

642
01:09:03,530 --> 01:09:05,009
It's quite a noise, isn't it?

643
01:09:05,130 --> 01:09:07,121
It's a midnight feast.

644
01:09:07,250 --> 01:09:10,322
But food is not permitted in dormitories.

645
01:09:10,450 --> 01:09:13,442
They asked me for permission
and I allowed it.

646
01:09:13,570 --> 01:09:16,004
It is not for you
to grant such permission.

647
01:09:16,130 --> 01:09:19,327
Go to bed, old woman.

648
01:09:19,450 --> 01:09:22,522
Miss Nieven will hear of this.

649
01:09:47,650 --> 01:09:49,242
I feel so funny.

650
01:10:30,570 --> 01:10:33,607
- Come on, Fiamma, help us out.
- Someone's coming.

651
01:10:33,730 --> 01:10:37,279
- Drag her to the bed, quick.
- Shut up, it's not funny.

652
01:10:45,890 --> 01:10:50,008
Sorry, Miss G. We didn't know
she'd had so much to drink.

653
01:10:51,370 --> 01:10:54,168
See that this room
is put back together.

654
01:10:55,970 --> 01:10:58,120
And clean yourselves up.

655
01:10:58,650 --> 01:10:59,969
You look a fright.

656
01:11:11,730 --> 01:11:14,324
I shall hide her until she's sober.

657
01:11:14,450 --> 01:11:17,283
It will do none of us any good
if she's discovered in this state.

658
01:11:22,490 --> 01:11:25,607
- Sorry, Miss G.
- Thank you, Miss G.

659
01:11:25,730 --> 01:11:27,209
Thank you.

660
01:11:27,770 --> 01:11:29,249
Sorry.

661
01:11:48,370 --> 01:11:50,600
I would do anything for you.

662
01:11:53,530 --> 01:11:55,760
You do know that, don't you?

663
01:11:58,130 --> 01:12:01,122
We're going to be great friends,
you and I.

664
01:12:01,770 --> 01:12:04,238
And share simply everything.

665
01:12:08,570 --> 01:12:11,289
We'll see the world together.

666
01:12:12,410 --> 01:12:13,889
We...

667
01:12:14,930 --> 01:12:18,559
We will ride with bandits
in South America

668
01:12:18,690 --> 01:12:22,046
with rough diamonds
hidden in our saddles.

669
01:12:24,050 --> 01:12:26,166
There are islands, you know,

670
01:12:26,290 --> 01:12:28,929
where there are undiscovered tribes,

671
01:12:29,050 --> 01:12:31,848
places no one has explored.

672
01:12:40,850 --> 01:12:42,727
We'll climb the canopies of Amazonas

673
01:12:42,850 --> 01:12:46,968
and talk of the life we've lived.

674
01:12:48,690 --> 01:12:51,124
Anything is possible, you know.

675
01:12:52,130 --> 01:12:55,406
But you have to learn...to share.

676
01:12:57,330 --> 01:12:59,560
You can't make friends beg.

677
01:13:52,410 --> 01:13:54,321
Don't make me beg.

678
01:14:36,410 --> 01:14:39,561
- Fuzzy?
- I'm waiting for Fiamma.

679
01:14:50,930 --> 01:14:57,961
<i>* O joyful light, for in thee only</i>

680
01:14:58,090 --> 01:15:03,084
<i>* In trust we seek
and seeking find a way</i>

681
01:15:03,210 --> 01:15:10,002
<i>* Strength of the tempted father
of the lonely</i>

682
01:15:10,130 --> 01:15:16,239
<i>* From out our darkness
bringest thou the day...</i>

683
01:15:31,730 --> 01:15:33,482
I can smell your sick.

684
01:15:33,610 --> 01:15:34,838
Sorry.

685
01:15:36,930 --> 01:15:41,845
If you need to heave,
do it where I can't see it or smell it.

686
01:15:55,170 --> 01:15:56,808
What do you think
they're talking about?

687
01:15:59,370 --> 01:16:02,760
- Maybe something they did last night.
- What do you mean?

688
01:16:04,450 --> 01:16:08,841
Fiamma's not a virgin, you know.
She's quite the little whore.

689
01:16:10,410 --> 01:16:15,086
She seduced that beastly foreigner
and now she's seduced our Miss G.

690
01:16:18,290 --> 01:16:21,600
- You're upsetting the others.
- I don't care.

691
01:16:21,730 --> 01:16:25,040
Let them be upset.
Let them see that I hate you.

692
01:16:27,210 --> 01:16:30,008
I want them to know
what you really are.

693
01:17:11,810 --> 01:17:13,721
Is everything all right, Miss G?

694
01:17:14,290 --> 01:17:16,201
Has something happened?

695
01:17:18,490 --> 01:17:21,050
I was thinking of resuming
my travels.

696
01:17:21,970 --> 01:17:23,688
In the holidays?

697
01:17:25,290 --> 01:17:27,008
And beyond.

698
01:17:27,690 --> 01:17:29,169
Miss G!

699
01:17:31,330 --> 01:17:33,798
There are parts of Asia
I would like to see.

700
01:17:35,410 --> 01:17:37,526
The silk route of Xi'an,

701
01:17:37,650 --> 01:17:39,766
the highlands of Tibet.

702
01:17:44,490 --> 01:17:46,481
You won't leave us.

703
01:17:50,970 --> 01:17:52,961
I have to leave.

704
01:17:54,210 --> 01:17:57,725
Fiamma wants to make it impossible
for me to stay.

705
01:17:57,850 --> 01:18:00,080
But what can she do?

706
01:18:06,610 --> 01:18:10,080
She intends to spread hateful lies
about me.

707
01:18:11,410 --> 01:18:15,198
She will destroy my reputation.
Do you understand?

708
01:18:22,050 --> 01:18:25,804
I am eyeless in Gaza,
betrayed to the Philistines.

709
01:19:07,450 --> 01:19:08,439
Come on.

710
01:19:32,610 --> 01:19:35,443
- Fiamma, get out!
- Go away.

711
01:19:35,570 --> 01:19:38,562
Di! You're being too rough!

712
01:19:44,810 --> 01:19:49,008
Miss G is leaving us,
and it's all Fiamma's fault!

713
01:19:49,130 --> 01:19:51,121
We are abandoned.

714
01:19:52,130 --> 01:19:54,041
What happened with Miss G last night?

715
01:19:55,610 --> 01:19:57,043
You have to tell us the truth.

716
01:19:57,170 --> 01:19:59,923
Were you playing St. Agnes Eve
with Miss G last night?

717
01:20:00,050 --> 01:20:02,120
You have to answer.

718
01:20:02,890 --> 01:20:04,926
I don't feel well.

719
01:20:05,050 --> 01:20:06,881
Not so fast Princess Fiamma.

720
01:20:07,010 --> 01:20:09,285
You have to tell us
what happened last night.

721
01:20:11,250 --> 01:20:13,241
What do you think happened?

722
01:20:14,490 --> 01:20:17,880
Did you do it with Miss G?
Did you do it for real?

723
01:20:18,010 --> 01:20:20,285
You're not a virgin, are you?

724
01:20:20,410 --> 01:20:23,004
You said you would be kind.
Not disgusting.

725
01:20:23,130 --> 01:20:25,690
You know what's happened.

726
01:20:26,290 --> 01:20:29,680
Look at what she has done to me!
Why can't you see it?

727
01:20:31,850 --> 01:20:33,761
- Liar!
- No!

728
01:20:34,490 --> 01:20:37,368
We have to tell someone
what she has done to me.

729
01:20:41,930 --> 01:20:43,329
No.

730
01:20:48,250 --> 01:20:50,810
- Take it back.
- No!

731
01:20:53,450 --> 01:20:55,008
That's not how you play.

732
01:21:00,490 --> 01:21:01,479
After her!

733
01:21:17,330 --> 01:21:19,207
Where did she go?

734
01:21:19,330 --> 01:21:21,002
I can see her. Follow me!

735
01:21:45,370 --> 01:21:47,759
We're coming to get you!

736
01:21:48,330 --> 01:21:49,843
Where are you?

737
01:21:49,970 --> 01:21:51,528
I can see her!

738
01:22:13,490 --> 01:22:15,685
You disgusting, horrible girl.

739
01:22:18,250 --> 01:22:23,005
Filthy girl!
We're going to teach you a lesson.

740
01:22:23,130 --> 01:22:24,961
You cow!

741
01:22:26,530 --> 01:22:28,760
- Leave me alone.
- Poppy, Di, stop, please!

742
01:22:28,890 --> 01:22:30,482
I can't breathe!

743
01:22:30,610 --> 01:22:34,000
Di, she's had enough.
Please, please stop it.

744
01:22:47,490 --> 01:22:50,163
Di. Di, what's wrong with her?

745
01:22:51,210 --> 01:22:52,689
What's wrong with her?

746
01:22:52,810 --> 01:22:55,278
Di, why does she sound like that?

747
01:23:02,290 --> 01:23:06,727
Go and get help.
Find Miss G, find anybody!

748
01:23:32,370 --> 01:23:34,247
Thank God I found it.

749
01:23:35,410 --> 01:23:39,483
I'll take it from here, Radfield.
Go and find Miss Nieven at once.

750
01:23:52,490 --> 01:23:55,368
Everything is going to be all right.

751
01:23:55,490 --> 01:23:57,287
I'm here now.

752
01:24:21,130 --> 01:24:24,122
Please, please.

753
01:24:24,250 --> 01:24:25,729
Please.

754
01:24:30,610 --> 01:24:32,089
Please.

755
01:24:36,610 --> 01:24:38,805
My beautiful child.

756
01:24:40,050 --> 01:24:41,688
My beautiful girl.

757
01:24:45,170 --> 01:24:48,082
I suppose you were not really meant
for this world.

758
01:24:50,650 --> 01:24:53,289
Go to sleep now.

759
01:24:53,410 --> 01:24:55,241
Go to sleep.

760
01:26:52,690 --> 01:26:54,965
We didn't mean it.

761
01:26:57,290 --> 01:26:59,406
We were just playing.

762
01:27:07,650 --> 01:27:09,447
What's going to happen, Di?

763
01:27:11,970 --> 01:27:15,679
Let's go and talk to Miss G.
Maybe she'll know what to do.

764
01:27:15,810 --> 01:27:18,643
We can tell her
we just wanted to give her a scare.

765
01:27:18,770 --> 01:27:21,762
Whatever we say, we did this.

766
01:27:21,890 --> 01:27:23,687
We're to blame.

767
01:27:24,890 --> 01:27:27,529
Please...stop.

768
01:27:34,170 --> 01:27:37,162
I have to tell you something.

769
01:28:06,210 --> 01:28:08,565
What can I do for you?

770
01:28:08,690 --> 01:28:12,729
I thought she was special.
Your favourite.

771
01:28:14,170 --> 01:28:15,842
Yes.

772
01:28:15,970 --> 01:28:17,608
It's a tragedy.

773
01:28:19,090 --> 01:28:20,842
But we shall move on.

774
01:28:20,970 --> 01:28:23,564
And we shall be as we once were,
a team.

775
01:28:29,930 --> 01:28:31,727
You don't deserve us.

776
01:28:41,290 --> 01:28:43,008
Is this a protest?

777
01:28:44,210 --> 01:28:46,599
You could have saved her.

778
01:28:46,730 --> 01:28:50,643
You need a scapegoat.
So, of course, it has to be me.

779
01:28:57,210 --> 01:28:59,121
You forget your part in this.

780
01:28:59,250 --> 01:29:01,639
Do you think you will be forgiven
for what you've done?

781
01:29:08,050 --> 01:29:10,359
We don't ask for forgiveness.

782
01:29:19,010 --> 01:29:20,953
Nothing will come of you now!

783
01:29:21,150 --> 01:29:24,523
Your lights are extinguished!

784
01:29:34,610 --> 01:29:37,124
I appreciate your coming to see me,
Miss Radfield.

785
01:29:37,970 --> 01:29:41,246
We all feel we are in some way
to blame.

786
01:29:42,210 --> 01:29:46,567
But you must accept
that this was an act of God,

787
01:29:46,690 --> 01:29:50,808
and not allow rumour and hysteria
to tarnish this school's reputation.

788
01:29:54,730 --> 01:29:59,663
Miss Gribben will, however,
be taking a leave of absence

789
01:30:00,090 --> 01:30:02,285
to deal with this tragedy.

790
01:30:02,410 --> 01:30:05,243
Beyond that,
I consider this matter closed.

791
01:30:08,250 --> 01:30:14,050
Subtitles: Arigon

792
01:30:45,370 --> 01:30:50,205
<i>Dear team. Please don't be cross
with me for leaving you in the lurch.</i>

793
01:30:50,330 --> 01:30:53,367
<i>There is no place here for me now.</i>

794
01:30:53,490 --> 01:30:55,401
<i>And I feel with great certainty</i>

795
01:30:55,530 --> 01:30:58,124
<i>that I must chance
to make a discovery of my own.</i>

796
01:31:00,810 --> 01:31:04,041
<i>I'm not sure I will come across
elephants or crocodiles immediately,</i>

797
01:31:06,410 --> 01:31:09,208
<i>but I shall write and tell you
the minute I do.</i>

798
01:31:20,370 --> 01:31:23,043
<i>You must look after each other now</i>

799
01:31:23,170 --> 01:31:26,719
<i>and do your best
to be fearless and true.</i>

800
01:31:26,850 --> 01:31:29,000
<i>Carry these notions
forth into the world,</i>

801
01:31:29,130 --> 01:31:32,008
<i>because without you
they will simply disappear.</i>

802
01:31:36,010 --> 01:31:39,366
<i>Don't fret.
I will write soon and...</i>

803
01:31:40,050 --> 01:31:43,440
<i>PS: I promise to replace
the shortbreads.</i>

804
01:31:44,570 --> 01:31:46,208
<i>Love, Di.</i>
