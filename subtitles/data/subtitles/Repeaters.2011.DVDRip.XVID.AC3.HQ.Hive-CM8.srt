00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,134
l was in the rec room

167
00:15:10,299 --> 00:15:13,169
and l-l touched the TV.

168
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:15,501
l got this shock.

169
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,935
That's the last thing
l remember.

170
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,602
- Same thing happened with me
with my light.

171
00:15:21,766 --> 00:15:23,167
- Weeks?
- Who cares how it happened?

172
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,935
The real question is,
what are we gonna do with it?

173
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,568
- What were you doing last night?

174
00:15:29,433 --> 00:15:31,368
- Whatwere you doing?
- l was in the shower, okay?

175
00:15:31,533 --> 00:15:33,001
l got shocked, too.

176
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:36,034
- Then what?

177
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,501
- l don't remember.

178
00:15:38,733 --> 00:15:39,767
- Me neither.

179
00:15:39,933 --> 00:15:41,834
- The same thing happened
to all of us.

180
00:15:43,466 --> 00:15:46,335
- Fuck, l'm gonna get that call again.

181
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,435
- Uh, Sonia,

182
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,501
there's a call for you.

183
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:09,068
- Exactly the same.

184
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,335
- You all right?

185
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:33,101
- Shouldn't we be doing something?

186
00:16:36,466 --> 00:16:38,034
We just lived through
the same day mice.

187
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,302
Are we just gonna sit here and waste it?

188
00:16:42,533 --> 00:16:44,501
- Last night, on the news...

189
00:16:46,033 --> 00:16:48,168
There'_there's ajumper at the dam.

190
00:16:50,533 --> 00:16:52,001
Let's go.

191
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:53,467
Let's do it.

192
00:16:53,633 --> 00:16:56,035
- What about cu_ew?
- Fuck cu_ew.

193
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:30,934
- Shit, we gotta stop him.
- No, it's... It's too late.

194
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,667
- Couldn't sleep.

195
00:18:17,033 --> 00:18:18,467
- Me neither.

196
00:18:25,866 --> 00:18:27,667
At least you went to see him.

197
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,268
- l didn't.

198
00:18:31,433 --> 00:18:33,501
- l thought you went to the hospital.

199
00:18:35,866 --> 00:18:38,501
- l went to the hospital, but...

200
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,168
l just couldn't go into his room.

201
00:18:45,933 --> 00:18:49,036
- What do you think'd happen
ifwe just...

202
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,669
Stayed in here all night?

203
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,101
- Trouble for sure.

204
00:18:57,266 --> 00:18:58,567
- Then l'm not leaving.

205
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,169
- Why do you think
this is happening to us?

206
00:19:20,866 --> 00:19:23,835
- Sory.
- No, it's... It's okay.

207
00:19:36,099 --> 00:19:38,569
- T:30, Halsted!

208
00:19:38,733 --> 00:19:39,967
- Bob!

209
00:19:40,133 --> 00:19:41,300
- What?

210
00:19:43,033 --> 00:19:44,067
- What day is it?

211
00:19:44,233 --> 00:19:46,335
Last time l checked,
it was Wednesday.

212
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,568
- Look, we're gonna figure this out.

213
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,167
- We're not gonna figure out shit, okay?

214
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:57,035
We're gonna keep repeating the same day
over and over again

215
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,569
until we go completely
out of our fucking minds.

216
00:19:59,733 --> 00:20:03,002
- Okay, but, look, we each had
the same shock of electricity

217
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:04,367
or whatever, right? So...

218
00:20:06,366 --> 00:20:08,735
- So, what? So maybe
that's something that we do?

219
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:11,135
- Okay, you go and electrocute
yourself then, sister,

220
00:20:11,299 --> 00:20:13,769
but l'm gonna enjoy it while l got it.

221
00:20:19,233 --> 00:20:21,835
God, what is that girl's problem?

222
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,102
You know, ifyou think about it,
it doesn't really matterwhat we do today.

223
00:20:31,266 --> 00:20:33,167
Right? l mean,
l could take a piss in group.

224
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,501
As a matter of fact,
l could just piss on Bob.

225
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:38,035
Tomorrow, it'd be like
it never happened.

226
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,368
- Yeah. l don't know, man.

227
00:20:40,533 --> 00:20:43,836
l... just feel like we
shouldn't mess with it, you know?

228
00:20:44,866 --> 00:20:46,834
- What do you think
we should do with it?

229
00:20:48,433 --> 00:20:49,400
- l don't know.

230
00:21:38,066 --> 00:21:39,734
- Pull it out and put it back.

231
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:40,867
: What?
- The bottle of gin.

232
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:42,267
l can see it in your pants.

233
00:21:42,433 --> 00:21:44,668
Pull it out and put it back!
- It's not in my pants.

234
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:47,402
- What do you call that? Put it back!
You know what, both ofyou,

235
00:21:47,566 --> 00:21:49,034
get the hell out of my store!

236
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,001
Both ofyou, get out! Idiots!

237
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,835
- Feeling bette_
- Oh, starting to.

238
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,735
- What the fuck are you doing?
What the fuck are you doing?

239
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:07,134
Oh, no, dude.

240
00:22:07,299 --> 00:22:08,334
We'd better pray tomomow repeats.

241
00:22:11,066 --> 00:22:12,400
Fuck!

242
00:22:19,766 --> 00:22:20,900
You're sick! Sick!

243
00:22:23,066 --> 00:22:24,066
Oh, Bobby...

244
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:32,935
Whoa, Bob likes pussy.

245
00:22:35,133 --> 00:22:36,934
Who am l? Who am l?

246
00:22:46,466 --> 00:22:47,433
Bob...

247
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:49,468

248
00:22:49,633 --> 00:22:50,667

249
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,302
- What the fuck?

250
00:22:54,466 --> 00:22:55,500
- Oh, no...

251
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:59,402
Nearly Legal. Near1y Legal. Fuck, look.

252
00:22:59,566 --> 00:23:01,935
Oh, fuck.

253
00:23:03,133 --> 00:23:05,502
- All right, freeze, boys!
Party's over. Hands on your head.

254
00:23:05,666 --> 00:23:07,501
Let's go, right now.
Hands on your head.

255
00:23:07,666 --> 00:23:08,900
That's it.

256
00:23:12,533 --> 00:23:14,635
Looks like you screwed up royally
this time, eh, Weeks, huh?

257
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:17,369
Just like the old man, huh?

258
00:23:17,533 --> 00:23:18,934
Hands behind your back.

259
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:30,867
Halsted.

260
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,401
Your mom posted bail.

261
00:23:39,766 --> 00:23:40,933
- See you this morning.

262
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,334
- Well...

263
00:23:52,033 --> 00:23:54,034
Looks like no daddy coming for you,
cowboy.

264
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:13,368
- Breaking and entering?
Vandalism?

265
00:24:13,533 --> 00:24:16,702
Your first day pass
and that's what you do with it, huh?

266
00:24:16,866 --> 00:24:19,301
Well, you must be
really proud ofyourself.

267
00:24:19,466 --> 00:24:22,602
You have any idea what
that little exercisejust cost me?

268
00:24:26,033 --> 00:24:27,334
Kyle...

269
00:24:36,966 --> 00:24:40,202
OO this morning,
an unidentified man threw himself

270
00:24:40,366 --> 00:24:41,667
omthe Mission City dam--

271
00:25:08,866 --> 00:25:11,235
- It's weird.

272
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,300
l was scared,

273
00:25:12,466 --> 00:25:14,334
but...

274
00:25:17,533 --> 00:25:20,836
At the same time,
l felt... really alive.

275
00:25:24,433 --> 00:25:26,168
- What if it doesn't repeat?

276
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:30,903
You're gonna have a criminal record
on top ofyour drug histoy.

277
00:25:31,066 --> 00:25:33,334
That's pretty awesome, Halsted.

278
00:25:44,566 --> 00:25:46,501
T:30, Halsted!

279
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,568
- Hey, Bob?

280
00:25:53,133 --> 00:25:54,067

l hear there's been

282
00:25:55,466 --> 00:25:57,334
a few break-ins
in the neighbourhood lately?

283
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,201
- What the hell are you talking about?

284
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,001
- Nothing.
- Okay, come on, let's go.

285

So, what's on the program?

293

- Clean it up. Right now.

294
00:26:43,866 --> 00:26:44,967
- You know,

295
00:26:45,133 --> 00:26:47,535
l think our man, Bob,
on his down time,

296
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:50,402
he likes to just settle in
with a little bit ofVictoria gin.

297
00:26:50,566 --> 00:26:51,833
- Victoria gin?

298
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,535

490
00:39:54,199 --> 00:39:57,036
Only it took him three days
to rise from the dead.

491
00:39:57,866 --> 00:39:59,500
- Good morning.

492
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:18,469
- Okay, you died last night.
l saw you die.

493
00:40:18,633 --> 00:40:21,836
- What was it like?
Do you... remember anything?

494
00:40:26,433 --> 00:40:28,501
- l just remember right before,
and then...

495
00:40:30,099 --> 00:40:31,334
lt's blank.

496
00:40:38,433 --> 00:40:40,668
You know, l've thought
about suicide before, but...

497
00:40:42,866 --> 00:40:45,034
l mean, right in that moment,
right before it happened,

498
00:40:45,199 --> 00:40:46,167
l...

499
00:40:48,699 --> 00:40:50,802
Can't believe how bad l wanted to live.

500
00:40:54,699 --> 00:40:56,802
- We have to stop. Right now.
- What?

501
00:40:56,966 --> 00:40:58,834
- If today hadn't repeated--
- But it did repeat,

502
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,401
and it looks like it's gonna
keep on repeating.

503
00:41:00,566 --> 00:41:02,668
- Yeah, w-we're tempting fate.

504
00:41:02,833 --> 00:41:03,934
- Wejust gotta figure something out, okay?

505
00:41:04,099 --> 00:41:05,701
We gotta get out of this somehow.

506
00:41:07,366 --> 00:41:09,835
- You've got to be fucking kidding me.
This is a fucking gift.

507
00:41:10,866 --> 00:41:13,335
We can do anything we want, anything.

508
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:18,734
lt's your fuckin' loss.

509
00:41:34,366 --> 00:41:35,300
- Don't you think it's kind ofweird

510
00:41:35,466 --> 00:41:39,670
that all this stum happens
on the same day your dad dies?

511
00:42:01,366 --> 00:42:04,335
- My dad used to force himself on me.

512
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:11,370
And a-at first, l-l didn't know what to do.

513
00:42:11,533 --> 00:42:13,534
l mean, l...

514
00:42:13,699 --> 00:42:16,035
l didn't even know what he was doing.

515
00:42:17,866 --> 00:42:19,100
And as l got older,

516
00:42:19,266 --> 00:42:21,334
l would fight back, but...

517
00:42:25,866 --> 00:42:27,701
Never seemed to stop it.

518
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,668
So, l mean, l-l don't know what...

519
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:41,003
What, l'm supposed to give him
some sort of peace of mind for that?

520
00:42:46,333 --> 00:42:48,501
- Here we go.

521
00:42:48,666 --> 00:42:50,167
No!
- No, no, no!

522
00:42:50,866 --> 00:42:53,068
Don't! Don't! No!

523
00:42:53,233 --> 00:42:54,601
- Fuck om!
- No!

524
00:42:54,766 --> 00:42:56,701
- You don't want to do this!
- Who are you?

525
00:42:56,866 --> 00:42:58,534
- You don't want to do this.

526
00:42:58,699 --> 00:42:59,700
Look at me.
- Let go of me!

527
00:42:59,866 --> 00:43:01,701
- You don't want to do this.

528
00:43:01,866 --> 00:43:03,867
- Please let me go,
please let me go.

529
00:43:04,033 --> 00:43:05,334
: Please...

530
00:43:12,199 --> 00:43:14,835
It's okay...
: Please let me go...

531
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:21,335
- The news said it was a man, but...

532
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:24,368
lt was a girl. Just a girI.

533
00:43:24,533 --> 00:43:26,668
- l know, she's, like,
the same age as me.

534
00:43:28,199 --> 00:43:29,401
- Maybe that's what we're
supposed to be doing.

535
00:43:29,566 --> 00:43:32,035
You know, maybe we're supposed
to be helping people.

536
00:43:32,199 --> 00:43:34,669
- She's still going
to be there again tomorrow.

537
00:43:40,099 --> 00:43:44,204
- He grabbed me, and l tried,
and l said stop, and he wouldn't, and l...

538
00:43:44,366 --> 00:43:46,101
- Okay, we'll get you anotherjacket.

539
00:43:46,266 --> 00:43:48,134
- Copy that. We'll bring her in
for an assessment.

540
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:50,201
Get all the necessay tests.

541
00:43:50,366 --> 00:43:52,134
- What's going on?

542
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:54,168
- A girI got attacked.

543
00:43:57,033 --> 00:43:59,568
- l need a description.
- l don't know what he looked like!

544
00:43:59,733 --> 00:44:00,934
- Do you know who did this to you?

545
00:44:01,099 --> 00:44:03,202
- Don't touch me!
- Can you give me a description?

546
00:44:04,199 --> 00:44:05,200
- It was him.

547
00:44:05,366 --> 00:44:06,366
- What?

548
00:44:06,533 --> 00:44:08,201
- It was him!

549
00:44:08,366 --> 00:44:09,600
- Hey, hey!
- Just let me go...

550
00:44:09,766 --> 00:44:10,833
Don't touch me, okay?

551
00:44:22,133 --> 00:44:24,602
- What the hell is the matter
with you Kyle, huh?

552
00:44:24,766 --> 00:44:25,700
- Kyle!

553
00:44:27,199 --> 00:44:28,634
Stop!

554
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,001
Stop it!

555
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,768
- What the fuck?

556
00:44:35,933 --> 00:44:37,367
- You raped her!
You fucking raped her!

557
00:44:37,533 --> 00:44:39,701
- l don't know what you're
fucking talking about!

558
00:44:39,866 --> 00:44:42,068
- Don't fucking lie to me!

559
00:44:42,233 --> 00:44:44,335
You raped a 15-year-old girI!

560
00:44:46,699 --> 00:44:49,369
- Okay, fint of all, she was 16,
and l'm pretty sure that she was into it.

561
00:44:49,533 --> 00:44:51,401
- You fucking raped her!

562
00:44:51,566 --> 00:44:53,834
- Tomorrow, it'll be like
it never happened, Kyle!

563
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,335
- It doesn't make it okay.

564
00:45:00,866 --> 00:45:03,702
- So, what about holding up
the liquor store, huh?

565
00:45:03,866 --> 00:45:05,334
ls that okay?

566
00:45:06,199 --> 00:45:07,234
What about kidnapping the dealer,

567
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:09,835
sticking a gun in his face,
making him eat cow shit?

568
00:45:11,266 --> 00:45:14,502
You were this close to blowing
his fucking brains out, Kyle!

569
00:45:16,699 --> 00:45:18,868
Now you're on some fucking guilt trip,

570
00:45:19,033 --> 00:45:20,834
you're gonna tell me how l can act?

571
00:45:23,199 --> 00:45:25,735
l don't know why this is happening,

572
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:28,869
but since it is,
l'm gonna take advantage of it, okay?

573
00:45:29,033 --> 00:45:31,335
And you two better
stay the fuck out of my way.

574
00:46:20,366 --> 00:46:22,501
- Why is this happening to us?

575
00:46:39,266 --> 00:46:42,102
T:30, Halsted!

576
00:46:43,533 --> 00:46:44,834

577
00:46:45,866 --> 00:46:47,667

578
00:46:50,033 --> 00:46:51,701
- It's Wednesday, right?

579
00:46:51,866 --> 00:46:53,934
- Last time l checked, yeah.

580
00:47:24,166 --> 00:47:25,567
- Nice one, loser!

581
00:47:25,733 --> 00:47:27,835
- l can't believe that Charlotte
was hanging out with Tiko.

582
00:47:29,866 --> 00:47:30,833
No, l...

583
00:47:33,033 --> 00:47:35,201
l just never thought that she was-
- She was what?

584
00:47:36,466 --> 00:47:37,400
Like you?

585
00:47:39,666 --> 00:47:40,833
- l don't know.

586
00:47:45,033 --> 00:47:47,502
- Okay, so, l have a proposition foryou.

587
00:47:47,666 --> 00:47:48,833
- l don't think l want to hear

588
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,601
this proposition.
- l stole them from my mom,

589
00:47:50,766 --> 00:47:53,101
and now you have to take them.
Come on, l went through so much trouble.

590
00:47:53,266 --> 00:47:54,667
- How did you steal this?

591
00:47:54,833 --> 00:47:56,568
- l took them from her purse
like l take eveything.

592
00:47:56,733 --> 00:47:58,501
- Hey, CharIotte...

593
00:48:01,133 --> 00:48:02,334
Hey, uh...

594
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:05,603
Look, do you want to, uh... just, um-

595
00:48:05,766 --> 00:48:07,300
- l don't want to talk to you.

596
00:48:07,466 --> 00:48:08,700
- Charlotte!

597
00:48:08,866 --> 00:48:10,000
Hey...

00:48:11,699 --> 00:48:12,834
Um...

Look, l know you think
your brothers an asshole,

601
00:48:15,933 --> 00:48:19,269
and you're probably right, but...

602
00:48:20,866 --> 00:48:23,168
lt'sjust, ifyou would just let him
talk to you for a minute,

603
00:48:23,333 --> 00:48:25,568
you would be doing me
such a favour, okay?

604
00:48:25,733 --> 00:48:27,468
Because l am so tired
of hearing him bitch

605
00:48:27,633 --> 00:48:29,434
about how shitty he's been to you,

606
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:31,501
and how you'll never forgive him...

607
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,135
Look, we're going to go
get some Chinese food.

608
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:40,367
Why don't you guys come?

616
00:49:07,266 --> 00:49:08,600
- You're gonna go blonde?
- Yeah.

617
00:49:08,766 --> 00:49:11,068

618
00:49:11,233 --> 00:49:13,401
l mean, l love the blonde,
but your hair...

619
00:49:13,566 --> 00:49:15,267
l mean, it goes so well with your eyes.
It's pretty.

620
00:49:16,533 --> 00:49:18,701

00:49:27,866 --> 00:49:29,067
You girls want to get more fucked up

00:49:55,099 --> 00:49:56,234
become a cop anyways?

633
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,001
- Just keep talking.
Come on, Weeks, keep talking.

634
00:50:00,166 --> 00:50:02,501
All right, you know what,
that's not even remotely funny.

635
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:04,634
Look, you want to think vey carefully
about what you're doing right now.

636
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,768
- Oh, l'm thinking, l'm thinking.

00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:36,501
You don't know what you're missing.

648
00:50:50,199 --> 00:50:51,100
- You guys okay?

649
00:50:51,266 --> 00:50:53,167
Hey... You okay?

650
00:50:54,033 --> 00:50:55,501
Charlotte, you okay?

651
00:50:56,466 --> 00:50:58,501
You all right? You okay?

652
00:51:11,233 --> 00:51:13,168
T:30, Halsted!

653
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:24,667
- What are you doing?

654
00:52:24,833 --> 00:52:26,401
What the fuck are you doing?

655
00:52:26,566 --> 00:52:27,900
- Hey, eveything that you're doing

656
00:52:28,066 --> 00:52:30,101
is gonna stay with you!
It's gonna stay with all of us!

657
00:52:30,266 --> 00:52:31,300
- No, Kyle!

658
00:52:31,466 --> 00:52:32,667
You do not want to do this, Kyle!

659
00:52:34,666 --> 00:52:35,900
: Kyle!

660
00:53:00,699 --> 00:53:02,168
- You have to do this.

661
00:53:03,866 --> 00:53:05,834
- It's not gonna make any dimerence.

662
00:53:07,533 --> 00:53:08,834
Nothing does.

663
00:53:11,866 --> 00:53:13,500
- You have to ty.

664
00:53:52,866 --> 00:53:54,334
You know, it's amazing...

665
00:53:55,866 --> 00:53:59,836
The things l could justi_
just to score, you know?

666
00:54:05,199 --> 00:54:08,836
Like, l'll take this from my mom,
she'll never know it was gone, or...

667
00:54:11,033 --> 00:54:13,001
steal my sistersATM card...

668
00:54:14,033 --> 00:54:16,168
siphon om some cash here and there.

669
00:54:18,533 --> 00:54:20,668
What's a kid need
with all that money, right?

670
00:54:31,699 --> 00:54:33,535
Then they...

671
00:54:33,699 --> 00:54:35,368
They trashed my house

672
00:54:35,533 --> 00:54:37,167
'cause of the money l owed.

673
00:54:39,533 --> 00:54:40,500
And...

674
00:54:43,533 --> 00:54:45,868
Beat the shit out of my little sister

675
00:54:46,033 --> 00:54:48,001
while l was five feet away...

676
00:54:50,533 --> 00:54:52,668
fucking blasted out of my mind.

677
00:55:08,733 --> 00:55:11,502
- l couldn't let anyone touch me
for the longest time.

678
00:55:42,533 --> 00:55:44,501
- Come on, Mike... You haven't had
anything to eat or drink all day.

679
00:55:49,366 --> 00:55:51,167
Me and Sonia are worried
about you, man.

680
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:54,602
- Oh, you are, huh?

681
00:55:54,766 --> 00:55:56,834
The mo ofyou, the thoughtful couple.
How nice.

682
00:55:57,866 --> 00:56:00,168
God, she finally got to you, huh?

683
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:03,669
Did she feed you the line...
What was it?

684
00:56:03,833 --> 00:56:08,170
Uh... "l couldn't let anybody touch me
for the longest time?"

685
00:56:08,333 --> 00:56:10,134
lt's right before she grabs your cock, right?

686
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:12,168
How was she for you?

687
00:56:13,166 --> 00:56:14,600
You know,
l wasn't all that impressed, myself.

688
00:56:14,766 --> 00:56:17,335
The biggest challenge is to find
a nice place to fuck around here.

689
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:19,501
Where'd you do it?

690
00:56:20,866 --> 00:56:22,267
You didn't do it, did you?

691
00:56:22,433 --> 00:56:23,567
What's the matter, buddy?!

692
00:56:23,733 --> 00:56:25,034
- Look!

693
00:56:25,199 --> 00:56:26,334
Mike!

694
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:28,902
Just... stop, okay?

695
00:56:29,066 --> 00:56:30,667
Stop.

696
00:56:33,866 --> 00:56:37,069
Let'sjust forget about this, okay?
Let'sjust forget about all this shit...

697
00:56:38,533 --> 00:56:40,835
And just ty again.
Let's ty to figure this out.

698
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,336
There's got to be
some kind of deeper meaning...

699
00:56:46,366 --> 00:56:47,834
to this.

700
00:56:52,199 --> 00:56:53,701
- l...

701
00:56:53,866 --> 00:56:55,834
l just took a piss in my pants.

702
00:56:57,533 --> 00:56:59,868
There's got to be
some deeper meaning in that,

703
00:57:00,033 --> 00:57:01,334
don'tyou think?

704
00:57:03,199 --> 00:57:04,834
See, look?

705
00:57:18,099 --> 00:57:19,835
l'll see you this morning!

706
00:57:44,199 --> 00:57:46,068
- Are you tipy yet?
- Maybe.

707
00:57:54,366 --> 00:57:56,434
Aren't you supposed
to be locked up somewhere?

708
00:57:56,599 --> 00:57:58,501
- CharIotte, l need to talk to you.

709
00:58:00,533 --> 00:58:02,501
- l don't want to talk to you.
- Charlotte...

710
00:58:04,533 --> 00:58:05,867
- Fuck om.

711
00:58:13,233 --> 00:58:15,835
- l just thought if l could talk to her...

712
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:20,169
lf l could explain...

713
00:58:24,866 --> 00:58:27,535
Maybe there'sjust no point
in me tying to explain the shit l did.

714
00:58:27,699 --> 00:58:29,902
- Kyle, she'll come around.

715
00:58:30,066 --> 00:58:31,667
- l don't know.

716
00:58:38,366 --> 00:58:39,834
Are you, uh...

717
00:58:41,699 --> 00:58:43,501
Are you okay about earlier?

718
00:58:46,766 --> 00:58:47,833
- Yeah.

719
00:58:49,366 --> 00:58:50,834
l'm vey okay.

720
00:59:27,366 --> 00:59:30,502
Doesn't a part ofyou wonder
if maybe he's right?

721
00:59:33,366 --> 00:59:37,169
l mean, if evey good thing we do
gets erased...

722
00:59:38,866 --> 00:59:40,834
Evey bad thing we do gets erased...

723
00:59:44,366 --> 00:59:46,835
What does it really matter what we do?

724
00:59:52,866 --> 00:59:53,833
- l guess...

725
00:59:57,533 --> 00:59:59,334
l just need for it to matter.

726
01:00:09,933 --> 01:00:11,634
T:30 Halsted!

727
01:00:30,766 --> 01:00:33,168
Nice one, loser!

728
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:43,201
- Hey...

729
01:00:43,366 --> 01:00:44,567
Bob, where's Mike?

730
01:00:44,733 --> 01:00:47,035
- What?
- Sonia? You know where they are?

731
01:00:47,199 --> 01:00:49,669
l don't know, Halsted, having a smoke?
l don't know.

732
01:01:24,766 --> 01:01:26,667
- Drop the club.

733
01:01:26,833 --> 01:01:28,834
Come on, Kyle, it's a fucking club.
Drop it.

734
01:01:30,266 --> 01:01:33,836
You think you can decide
how l spend my repeats?

735
01:01:35,666 --> 01:01:37,834
lt's only fair that l retum the favour.

736
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:40,334
Take the knife.

737
01:01:41,966 --> 01:01:44,034
The knife on the table, take it.

738
01:01:44,199 --> 01:01:45,568
- What?

739
01:01:45,733 --> 01:01:46,834
- Come on, Kyle.

740
01:01:49,533 --> 01:01:51,001
Good.

741
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,701
Stand over there.

742
01:01:53,866 --> 01:01:54,866
- Mike, what-

743
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:00,934
- Now...

744
01:02:02,199 --> 01:02:03,267
Cut his throat.

745
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,735
- Mike, please don't do this.
- Cut his throat,

746
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:09,501
or l'll put a bullet in her leg.

747
01:02:15,533 --> 01:02:17,635
l kid you not, Kyle.
l will put a hole in her leg

748
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:19,434
the size of a fucking grapefruit.

749
01:02:24,599 --> 01:02:26,468
Do it, or l'll put a bullet in her head!

750
01:02:26,633 --> 01:02:27,700
- You're fucked!

751
01:02:27,866 --> 01:02:29,567
- That's right, get angy!

752
01:02:29,733 --> 01:02:32,202
Get mothe_ucking feral!

753
01:02:32,366 --> 01:02:34,301
Cut his fucking throat!

754
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:51,501
Welcome to the club, Kyle.

755
01:03:17,199 --> 01:03:19,468
- You're okay...

756
01:03:22,199 --> 01:03:23,367
Come on, come on.

757
01:03:26,199 --> 01:03:27,434
All right...

758
01:04:14,866 --> 01:04:16,701

759
01:04:16,866 --> 01:04:18,667
Come on, what's wrong?
Come on...

760
01:04:18,833 --> 01:04:20,834
- No, l'm okay. l'm okay.

761
01:04:21,866 --> 01:04:23,200
- Fuck!

762
01:04:28,199 --> 01:04:31,169
- Get the fuck up!
Get up, you fucking piece of shit.

763
01:04:48,866 --> 01:04:50,667
- l knew you had it in you.

764
01:04:52,199 --> 01:04:54,235
l'm gonna give you three seconds
to get lost.

765
01:04:58,366 --> 01:04:59,500
- Fuck you.

766
01:05:24,599 --> 01:05:26,335
See you this morning, Kyle.

767
01:05:56,433 --> 01:05:57,934
T:30, Halsted!

768
01:06:23,333 --> 01:06:25,034
- Do you want me to come up?

769
01:06:25,199 --> 01:06:26,434
- No.

770
01:06:26,599 --> 01:06:27,834
l'm fine.

771
01:07:20,199 --> 01:07:21,834
- You're gonna die tonight.

772
01:07:26,099 --> 01:07:29,570
Don't ask me how l know, but it's true.

773
01:07:35,866 --> 01:07:39,836
l've thought about what l wanted
to say to you so many times.

774
01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:44,969
l don't hate you anymore.

775
01:07:45,133 --> 01:07:49,504
l don't, but l have to move on from this.

776
01:07:52,033 --> 01:07:54,835
l have to,
or else nothing's gonna change...

777
01:07:58,433 --> 01:08:00,168
For any of us.

778
01:08:57,766 --> 01:08:58,733
- What do you want?

779
01:08:58,899 --> 01:09:00,034
Are you in trouble?

780
01:09:00,199 --> 01:09:01,467
- No, l...

781
01:09:01,633 --> 01:09:03,234
They let us out for a few hours.

782
01:09:03,399 --> 01:09:04,667
Can l-can l come in?

783
01:09:04,833 --> 01:09:06,868
l really need to talk to Charlotte.

784
01:09:07,033 --> 01:09:09,235
- l-l really don't think it's a good idea.

785
01:09:09,399 --> 01:09:12,169
- Mom, l really need to talk to her.

786
01:09:13,333 --> 01:09:14,834
- Are you clean?

787
01:09:15,966 --> 01:09:18,034
- Yeah, Mom.

788
01:09:18,199 --> 01:09:19,935
Please let me talk to her.

789
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:24,501
- Okay.

790
01:09:34,699 --> 01:09:36,034
- Residents are reeling tonight

791
01:09:36,199 --> 01:09:37,634
over the death
of_o local police omicers

792
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:39,101
in what's shaping up to be

793
01:09:39,266 --> 01:09:41,768
a double homicide.
The suspect is described

794
01:09:41,933 --> 01:09:44,602
as a Caucasian male
in his early 20s...

795
01:09:48,566 --> 01:09:49,533
- CharIotte?

796
01:10:05,866 --> 01:10:07,267
- What are you doing here?

797
01:10:07,433 --> 01:10:09,902
- l need to talk to you.

798
01:10:10,066 --> 01:10:12,234
- Get the fuck out of my room.
- No.

799
01:10:12,399 --> 01:10:15,636
Charlotte, no, l'm not going anywhere
until you and l have talked, okay?

800
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:17,835
- We've got nothing to talk about.

801
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:40,635
Who's in the ca_

802
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:42,501
One ofyour addict friends?

803
01:10:45,100 --> 01:10:46,601
- Her name's Sonia.

804
01:10:46,766 --> 01:10:50,569
Yeah, l met her in rehab.

805
01:10:50,733 --> 01:10:54,336
l've been thinking a lot lately...

806
01:10:55,866 --> 01:10:56,967
Just about...

807
01:10:57,133 --> 01:11:00,369
About what l did to you and to Mom.

808
01:11:00,533 --> 01:11:01,867
- l don't want to hear this, Kyle.

809
01:11:02,033 --> 01:11:04,769
- And l can't let another day pass
without telling you...

810
01:11:06,366 --> 01:11:08,501
VMthout telling you how sory l am.

811
01:11:08,666 --> 01:11:10,000
- Fine. Are we through now?

812
01:11:13,533 --> 01:11:14,734
- Thing is,

813
01:11:14,899 --> 01:11:17,702
Charlotte, l see you going down
the same path that l did, and-

814
01:11:17,866 --> 01:11:19,701
- You think l'm a fuck-up like you?

815
01:11:19,866 --> 01:11:22,168
- No... No, that's not what l meant.

816
01:11:24,966 --> 01:11:27,501
- You don't have to watch over me.

817
01:11:28,199 --> 01:11:29,234
- But l...

818
01:11:29,399 --> 01:11:30,834
l do.

819
01:11:32,366 --> 01:11:34,367
Charlotte...

820
01:11:34,533 --> 01:11:36,434
Charlotte, l do,
'Cause that's what big brothers do

821
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:38,068
for their little sisters.

822
01:11:40,933 --> 01:11:43,835
And l know you probably don't care
right now, but...

823
01:11:47,866 --> 01:11:50,568
But from now on,
l'm going to be there foryou.

824
01:11:52,866 --> 01:11:55,468
l'll be there foryou when it counts,

825
01:11:55,633 --> 01:11:56,867
because...

826
01:11:57,033 --> 01:11:59,602
l love you.

827
01:11:59,766 --> 01:12:00,833
And...

828
01:12:04,533 --> 01:12:06,368
And l'm gonna be your big brother.

829
01:12:17,433 --> 01:12:19,835
T:30, Halsted!

830
01:13:21,533 --> 01:13:22,467
- Sonia!

831
01:13:22,633 --> 01:13:24,701
- Kyle?

832
01:13:25,733 --> 01:13:28,102
- Drop it. Drop it.

833
01:13:31,133 --> 01:13:32,834
Good.

834
01:13:33,866 --> 01:13:35,934
Now, l could tie you up all day, Kyle,

835
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:38,101
let you wallow in your own piss,

836
01:13:38,266 --> 01:13:40,835
but that's not much fun.

837
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:44,837
So what we're gonna do is play
a little game of hide-and-seek...

838
01:13:46,533 --> 01:13:47,667
with a mist.

839
01:13:49,100 --> 01:13:50,835
lf l find you...

840
01:13:52,466 --> 01:13:54,534
l'm gonna spend the rest
of the day hurting you.

841
01:13:56,666 --> 01:13:58,501
You've got one minute.

842
01:14:00,866 --> 01:14:03,068
One minute.

843
01:14:03,233 --> 01:14:05,435
- You okay?

844
01:14:07,033 --> 01:14:08,334
- Other door.

845
01:14:09,466 --> 01:14:10,733
One...
- Come on!

846
01:14:10,899 --> 01:14:13,435
- ...two... three...

847
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:16,736
four... five...

848
01:14:16,899 --> 01:14:19,168
six... seven. ..

849
01:14:19,333 --> 01:14:21,068

850
01:14:21,233 --> 01:14:22,601

851
01:14:22,766 --> 01:14:24,601

852
01:14:24,766 --> 01:14:26,934
Come on, come on...

853
01:14:29,033 --> 01:14:31,268
- One minute!

854
01:14:45,533 --> 01:14:46,567
- There! There!

855
01:14:46,733 --> 01:14:47,834
This way! Yeah!

856
01:14:55,866 --> 01:14:57,500
Woo!

857
01:15:08,866 --> 01:15:10,500
- Come on. Come on...

858
01:15:13,100 --> 01:15:16,169
- Come on out, kiddies,
l ain't got all day.

859
01:15:17,266 --> 01:15:19,001
Come on out!

860
01:15:40,966 --> 01:15:42,367

861
01:15:43,100 --> 01:15:44,634
Come on...

862
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:46,234
Come on, come on...

01:15:52,133 --> 01:15:53,167
Go!

865
01:16:08,866 --> 01:16:10,601
- Are you guys having fun yet?

866
01:16:10,766 --> 01:16:13,902
You know, the last rehab place l went to...

867
01:16:14,866 --> 01:16:17,668
They had us act out
homible events from our past.

868
01:16:17,833 --> 01:16:20,502
What do you say, Logan?
You could be nine years old again.

869
01:16:20,666 --> 01:16:21,933
l could play daddy!

870
01:16:23,433 --> 01:16:26,202
Or maybe Kyle could play daddy
since he can't stop fucking you!

871
01:16:27,233 --> 01:16:29,401
What the fuck are you doing?

872
01:16:33,566 --> 01:16:34,466
- Go.

873
01:16:34,633 --> 01:16:35,533
Go!

874
01:16:49,100 --> 01:16:50,668
Go!

875
01:17:11,233 --> 01:17:12,601
- Hey... Hey, kid!

876
01:17:14,399 --> 01:17:17,836
Hey, you all right?

877
01:17:30,699 --> 01:17:32,668
- It doesn't snow today.

878
01:17:33,866 --> 01:17:36,501
What day is it?
l said, what day is it?!

879
01:17:47,199 --> 01:17:48,634
Oh, fuck...

880
01:18:26,066 --> 01:18:27,167

881
01:18:27,333 --> 01:18:29,234
- l'm fine.
l just got a tetanus shot

882
01:18:29,399 --> 01:18:31,168

883
01:18:32,199 --> 01:18:33,701
Where is he?

884
01:18:35,533 --> 01:18:36,700
- No one's seen him.

885
01:18:40,033 --> 01:18:41,834
- We need you to come with us.

886
01:18:54,233 --> 01:18:56,168
- Get your fucking head down

01:18:56,333 --> 01:18:58,201

893
01:19:13,100 --> 01:19:15,502
- Lieutenant, this is Kyle Halsted
and Sonia Logan.

894
01:19:16,366 --> 01:19:18,367
- So l understand you've been
brought up to speed?

895
01:19:18,533 --> 01:19:19,600
- Yeah.

896
01:19:21,533 --> 01:19:24,068
- Most important thing is
you keep him calm.

897
01:19:29,733 --> 01:19:31,434
Gimme the phone, come on.

898
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:32,567

904
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:52,035
You thought the day
was gonna repeat again, right?

905
01:19:52,199 --> 01:19:53,834
You thought you had a clean slate.

906
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,702
You didn't know.

907
01:19:56,866 --> 01:19:59,535

908
01:20:04,866 --> 01:20:05,833

We can fix this.

01:20:08,766 --> 01:20:10,968
We got into this together, right?

911
01:20:11,133 --> 01:20:12,834
So we can fix it together.

912
01:20:14,533 --> 01:20:16,167
- You guys turned on me, man.

913
01:20:18,266 --> 01:20:20,267
You should've let it go.

914

You should've let it run its course.
You should have had my back, Kyle!

915
01:20:23,466 --> 01:20:24,500
Mike...

Don't take it out on them.

919
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:39,370
Please, man, don't do this to Charlotte.

920
01:20:45,733 --> 01:20:46,834
Mike?

921
01:20:49,399 --> 01:20:52,069

Stay still and shut up!

934
01:21:43,266 --> 01:21:44,233
- Mike!

935
01:21:45,166 --> 01:21:47,034
That's my sister.

936
01:21:47,199 --> 01:21:50,403
That's my baby sister

- Just give me the gun.
- Stop.

943
01:22:11,733 --> 01:22:14,168
- l was never gonna make amends
with my old man.

944
01:22:14,333 --> 01:22:16,301
l neverwas, and l neverwill.

945
01:22:16,466 --> 01:22:18,234
lt doesn't matter how many days repeat!

946
01:22:21,199 --> 01:22:22,534
- Give me the gun.

947
01:22:26,199 --> 01:22:28,001
- That's the dimerence
between you and me, right?

948
01:22:28,166 --> 01:22:30,167
Mike!

949
01:22:37,199 --> 01:22:39,001
Shh, shh...

01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:46,335
Shh...

01:23:06,733 --> 01:23:08,501
- You okay?

955
01:23:08,666 --> 01:23:09,833
- Yeah.

956
01:23:11,233 --> 01:23:14,603
Where the doors are moaning

957
01:23:14,766 --> 01:23:17,502
All day long

958
01:23:21,766 --> 01:23:26,704
Where the stairs are leaning

959
01:23:26,866 --> 01:23:28,834
Dusk till dawn

960
01:23:33,033 --> 01:23:35,702
Where the windows

961
01:23:35,866 --> 01:23:39,836
Are breathing in the light

962
01:23:44,533 --> 01:23:47,202
Where the rooms are

963
01:23:47,366 --> 01:23:51,169
A collection of our lives

964
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:00,335
Where the doors

965
01:24:00,500 --> 01:24:04,670
Are moaning all day long

966
01:24:09,866 --> 01:24:14,670
Where the stairs are leaning

967
01:24:14,833 --> 01:24:16,668
Dusk till dawn

968
01:24:21,199 --> 01:24:23,869
Where the windows

969
01:24:24,033 --> 01:24:27,836
Are breathing in the light

970
01:24:32,833 --> 01:24:35,135
Where the rooms are

971
01:24:35,300 --> 01:24:39,037
A collection of our lives

972
01:24:46,866 --> 01:24:49,301
This is a place

973
01:24:49,466 --> 01:24:53,169
Where l don'tfeel alone

974
01:24:57,766 --> 01:25:00,168
This is a place

975
01:25:01,866 --> 01:25:05,502
That l call my home...

976
01:25:15,866 --> 01:25:18,835
- Get up, Weeks.
Another day in paradise.

977
01:25:29,533 --> 01:25:31,368
Breakneck speed

978
01:25:34,866 --> 01:25:36,934
Tying up your hands

979
01:25:37,100 --> 01:25:40,837
'Cause you're landing back on yourfeet

980

You know what l mean

981
01:25:51,533 --> 01:25:53,835
Vowel change

982
01:25:57,033 --> 01:26:02,838
l remember when our voices
used to sound the same

983
01:26:04,866 --> 01:26:08,836
Now wejust translate

984
01:26:13,433 --> 01:26:17,870

Born on yourfeet running

987
01:26:27,366 --> 01:26:30,669
Forest fires underneath your bed

988
01:26:35,533 --> 01:26:38,068
But it's good to be back

989
01:26:38,233 --> 01:26:42,170
Good to be back
Good to be back

992
01:27:00,033 --> 01:27:04,504
'Cause all the pictures
are so bright and loud

993
01:27:06,166 --> 01:27:09,636

Super fun

1001
01:27:44,399 --> 01:27:48,036
At the movies drunk and young

1002
01:27:50,033 --> 01:27:53,836
Double knots that came undone

1003
01:27:55,533 --> 01:27:59,336
But the big bad years are gone

1004
01:28:01,100 --> 01:28:04,102
Yeah the big bad years are done

1005
01:28:04,266 --> 01:28:06,134
And gone away

1006
01:28:10,199 --> 01:28:16,839
