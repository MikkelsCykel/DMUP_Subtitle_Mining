Glenn: First of all,

2
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:25,525
i want to thank
everybody for coming.

3
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:27,027
Giving up your lunch hours
and all that.

4
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:30,030
And, lord knows,
very exciting for all of us.

5
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,031
Tucker:
Happy to be here.

6
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,032
Steve: Oh, me, too.

7
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,034
Absolutely. And let's just
get our hands right into it.

8
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,035
Who wants to start us off?

9
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:36,536
Steve: I'll be
happy to start.

10
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:38,038
You know what? Gwen,
why don't you start us off?

11
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,039
Gwen: Ok. Sure...

12
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,040
you don't need
the pointer here, do you?

13
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,541
No. I don't need
the pointer. Thanks.

14
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:42,542
I'll just hold on
to it, then.

15
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:43,543
Glenn:
Oh, she's fine. Gwen?

16
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:45,045
Gwen: There is
a concern that i have

17
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,546
that i think
needs addressing

18
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:48,548
is that we can't have
the port-a-potties

19
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,050
too far off
the main route,

20
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,551
because we do have
a lot of seniors.

21
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,553
Steve:
Uh, we've solved that.

22
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:55,055
We're gonna take
the port-a-potties

23
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,556
and put 'em
right over here.

24
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:58,058
They're not gonna
be in the way.

25
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,559
Gwen: We're gonna
put a receptacle

26
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:01,061
over near
arts and crafts.

27
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,063
This is the big bins
you're talking about?

28
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:04,564
Steve:
We've got barrels, too.

29
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:06,566
And we're gonna put
the barrels on every corner.

30
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:08,068
Glenn: Wait a minute.
That's... that's the crate?

31
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,569
Steve: That's the big
barrel, 'cause you got

32
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,571
the pie-eating going on
right over here.

33
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,073
It's more of a dumpster
than a barrel.

34
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,074
Glenn: That's another thing.
If anything happens

35
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,575
like last year
with that pie-eating...

36
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:19,079
which brings me
to a point... security.

37
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,080
Oh, god.

38
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,583
Security. I say
we put a rifle on here,

39
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:26,586
a man with a rifle here,
and a rifle here.

40
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:27,587
Protect the whole square.

41
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:28,588
Is that really
necessary?

42
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:31,091
Yes. Remember how much
we got egged last year?

43
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:32,092
Absolutely.

44
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:34,594
What can i tell you?
We're pleased as punch.

45
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,596
We... we are so proud.

46
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,598
We know that
whatever we do here

47
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:40,600
is a first for blaine
and a first for missouri,

48
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,602
that whatever we do
is going to be the standard

49
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:46,106
against which all other
sesquicentennials...

50
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:49,109
that's the 150...
will be judged.

51
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:52,112
The people of blaine
are can-do people.

52
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,613
In fact, you know, there's
an old saying in missouri

53
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:56,616
if you don't like the weather,
just wait 5 minutes.

54
00:01:56,616 --> 00:02:00,620
In blaine, i honestly
believe with hard work,

55
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,622
we can get that down
to 3 or 4 minutes.

56
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:05,041
Phil: Here in our
sesquicentennial year,

57
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,543
we've got a lot
to talk about.

58
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:08,044
There's a lot
to be proud of.

59
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:09,546
And we're very proud
of it,

60
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:10,547
and i think it's about time

61
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,048
that the world
knows more about blaine.

62
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:13,049
We're chomping at the bit,

63
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:15,051
certainly from this end,
to get it out there.

64
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:19,055
It all started
with blaine fabin.

65
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:21,057
He was hired by 30 settlers

66
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:24,060
to lead a wagon-train expedition
from philadelphia to california.

67
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,562
Uh, on the 14th night,

68
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:28,064
word has it they were
sitting around the campfire,

69
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:30,567
and blaine said,
"do you smell it?

70
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,569
Do you smell the salt
in the air?"

71
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:34,571
He said, "we're here.
I brought you to california."

72
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:36,573
And so there was
a big party that night.

73
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:39,075
And the next morning,
they got up. Uh...

74
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:40,577
they didn't see the ocean

75
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:43,079
because they were in missouri.

76
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:46,583
Uh, blaine was able to convince
them for a little while

77
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,084
that it was just low tide
and things,

78
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:50,587
but what had happened was
that he had made some mistakes.

79
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:53,590
Bad weather. Wasrt familiar,
perhaps, with the proper route.

80
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,591
But as it turns out,

81
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,593
everybody was quite happy
to be where they were.

82
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,595
So they said, "it's ok we didn't
make it to california.

83
00:02:58,595 --> 00:02:59,596
We'll stay here."

84
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:02,098
And that's why
i'm at this desk.

85
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:05,602
Well, i'm very proud to say
that i'm a direct descendant

86
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:06,603
of blaine fabin.

87
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:09,105
I've lived here all my life.

88
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:11,608
As did my parents
and their parents

89
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:13,610
and their parents
and their parents

90
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,111
and so on and so forth.

91
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:18,114
I'm very excited about
the show coming up,

92
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:20,116
because it'll be
the first time

93
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:23,620
i'll have the experience
of sitting in the audience

94
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:28,124
and seeing actors portray
my ancestor...

95
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:31,127
the... the actual
blaine fabin.

96
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:34,631
Being a fabin
is not always easy.

97
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:38,635
Um, i can certainly understand
how the kennedys feel.

98
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:42,138
Corky: I had been
living in new york

99
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:44,641
and working there
as an actor and director

100
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:47,143
and choreographer
for 25 years or so,

101
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:49,646
and i really felt
i needed a change.

102
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:52,148
I imagined, in my fantasy,
i suppose,

103
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:54,651
that when i came here,

104
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:57,153
i would have a completely
different life.

105
00:03:57,654 --> 00:04:00,156
Uh, perhaps, um...

106
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:01,658
a construction worker

107
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,159
or one of those guys

108
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:07,163
that works on those
high-wire things that, uh...

109
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:08,164
with the hard hat.

110
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:10,667
You know,
that sweeping sort of hat.

111
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,169
And, uh, with the chaps.

112
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,672
But that didn't really
work out.

113
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:17,674
I began to realize, i guess,

114
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:20,176
that the theater
was still in my blood,

115
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:23,179
and what i had to do was
make use of that,

116
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:27,183
so i offered my services
to the high school here,

117
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:28,685
and they accepted,

118
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,687
and i began to teach drama.

119
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,689
And within about 6 months,

120
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:35,191
i had formed
the blaine community players.

121
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:36,192
I got to tell you,

122
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:38,194
we are very, very excited
about the big show

123
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:40,697
that's happening
at the end of the festival.

124
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:43,199
Everyone right now
is just going crazy

125
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,701
getting ready to audition.

126
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:47,203
And unfortunately
i won't be able to audition.

127
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:50,206
We have to stock that day
and can't get out of it.

128
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:53,710
And corky will not let me
audition any other time.

129
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,712
So, "that's show business,"
is what he told me,

130
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:58,214
and, uh, you know,
he's the master.

131
00:04:58,214 --> 00:04:59,716
You gotta give him credit
for that.

132
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,718
Phil: President mckinley
did a whistle-stop tour

133
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,720
back in 1898.

134
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,722
And a little boy,
jimmy mcbean,

135
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:07,223
made a stool for him.

136
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:09,726
And he loved it so much
that he called back,

137
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,728
and said, "lookit, i would
like to give more of these

138
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:13,730
to dignitaries
who are visiting."

139
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,231
And before you knew it,

140
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:19,235
blaine is manufacturing
all these footstools.

141
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:21,237
And that's how the big...

142
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:23,740
that's how we got
the stool boom.

143
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:27,744
Blaine became the stool capital
of the world.

144
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,879
Corky: My first show
wasbarefoot in the park,

145
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:32,382
which was an absolute smash,

146
00:05:32,382 --> 00:05:34,884
but my production
on the stage ofbackdraft

147
00:05:34,884 --> 00:05:36,886
was what really
got them excited.

148
00:05:36,886 --> 00:05:40,890
This whole idea of
in-your-face theater

149
00:05:41,391 --> 00:05:42,892
really affected them.

150
00:05:42,892 --> 00:05:45,395
The conceptualization,
the whole abstraction,

151
00:05:45,395 --> 00:05:47,897
the obtuseness
of this production to me

152
00:05:47,897 --> 00:05:49,399
was what was interesting.

153
00:05:49,899 --> 00:05:53,903
I wanted the audience
to feel the heat from the fire,

154
00:05:53,903 --> 00:05:57,407
the fear... because people
don't like fire poked,

155
00:05:57,907 --> 00:05:59,409
poked in their noses.

156
00:05:59,409 --> 00:06:00,910
You know, when you get
a cinder from barbecue

157
00:06:01,411 --> 00:06:01,911
right on the end
of your nose

158
00:06:02,412 --> 00:06:04,414
and you kind of make
that little face.

159
00:06:04,414 --> 00:06:05,915
That's not a good thing.

160
00:06:05,915 --> 00:06:08,418
I wanted to have
the sense memory of that.

161
00:06:08,918 --> 00:06:10,920
So during the show,

162
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,422
i had someone
burn newspapers

163
00:06:12,922 --> 00:06:15,425
and... and send it through
the vents in the theater.

164
00:06:15,425 --> 00:06:17,427
Well, they freaked out.

165
00:06:17,927 --> 00:06:19,929
Of course, the fire marshal
came over,

166
00:06:19,929 --> 00:06:22,432
and they shut us down
for a couple of days.

167
00:06:22,932 --> 00:06:23,933
Ron: Mr. Bluestein,

168
00:06:23,933 --> 00:06:25,935
montezuma's revenge
is nothing more

169
00:06:25,935 --> 00:06:28,938
than good old-fashioned
american diarrhea.

170
00:06:28,938 --> 00:06:29,939
Adult diapers

171
00:06:29,939 --> 00:06:32,442
should never even
enter the picture.

172
00:06:32,442 --> 00:06:35,945
So you lose
a few pounds.

173
00:06:35,945 --> 00:06:37,947
My mom used to say
that blaine

174
00:06:37,947 --> 00:06:39,949
is a little town
with a big heart

175
00:06:39,949 --> 00:06:42,452
in the heart
of a big country.

176
00:06:42,952 --> 00:06:44,454
And, to me, blaine
is a kind of town

177
00:06:44,954 --> 00:06:48,458
where i can have
my own business,

178
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:51,461
meet and marry a wonderful
woman like sheila,

179
00:06:51,461 --> 00:06:54,964
and... and be something,
be somebody.

180
00:06:54,964 --> 00:06:56,966
Some people
find it ironical

181
00:06:56,966 --> 00:06:58,468
that even though
we run a travel agency,

182
00:06:58,468 --> 00:07:00,970
we've never been
outside of blaine.

183
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:02,472
Sheila:
With one exception.

184
00:07:02,972 --> 00:07:04,474
Well, we've never
been out...

185
00:07:04,474 --> 00:07:05,975
you left blaine.

186
00:07:05,975 --> 00:07:07,977
Well, i went
to jefferson city once.

187
00:07:07,977 --> 00:07:08,978
It was a...

188
00:07:08,978 --> 00:07:09,979
tell them why.

189
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,482
[Sighs]
It was a medical reason.

190
00:07:13,983 --> 00:07:15,485
You can tell 'em.

191
00:07:15,485 --> 00:07:18,488
Just minor surgery.

192
00:07:21,491 --> 00:07:23,993
Libby: I've been
working here at the d.q.

193
00:07:23,993 --> 00:07:25,995
For about, um...

194
00:07:28,998 --> 00:07:31,501
8 months, 7.

195
00:07:31,501 --> 00:07:33,503
I don't know.
Something like that.

196
00:07:33,503 --> 00:07:35,004
It's fun.

197
00:07:35,004 --> 00:07:37,507
You just do the cones.

198
00:07:37,507 --> 00:07:40,510
Make sundaes,
make blizzards, and...

199
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:42,011
put stuff on 'em and...

200
00:07:42,512 --> 00:07:44,514
see a lot of people come in.

201
00:07:44,514 --> 00:07:46,516
A lot of people
come to the d.q.

202
00:07:47,016 --> 00:07:49,519
Burgers. Ice cream.

203
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:52,522
Anything, you know?

204
00:07:52,522 --> 00:07:55,024
Cokes. Just drive in
and get a coke,

205
00:07:55,024 --> 00:07:57,527
if you're thirsty.

206
00:07:57,527 --> 00:08:00,530
Everybody thinks that roswell
was the first sighting

207
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:02,532
of a ufo
in the united states,

208
00:08:02,532 --> 00:08:04,033
and that's bull roar.

209
00:08:04,033 --> 00:08:06,536
We had the first sighting
here in 1946.

210
00:08:06,536 --> 00:08:09,038
And it wasrt just a sighting.
They didn't just fly by.

211
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:11,040
They stopped. They landed.

212
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,042
The people in blaine
went onboard the ship

213
00:08:13,543 --> 00:08:15,044
for a potluck dinner.

214
00:08:15,044 --> 00:08:18,047
Ufo expert: I've been coming out
to this landing site

215
00:08:18,047 --> 00:08:20,049
every day for 2 years

216
00:08:20,049 --> 00:08:22,051
to measure it.

217
00:08:22,051 --> 00:08:24,053
And here's the thing...

218
00:08:24,053 --> 00:08:27,557
the circumference
and the diameter change

219
00:08:27,557 --> 00:08:28,558
by a few inches,

220
00:08:29,058 --> 00:08:31,561
yet the radius
remains the same.

221
00:08:31,561 --> 00:08:33,563
Which brings me back
to the number 5.

222
00:08:34,063 --> 00:08:37,066
There are 5 letters
in the name "blaine."

223
00:08:37,567 --> 00:08:39,569
Mix the word "blaine" up,
mix it around,

224
00:08:39,569 --> 00:08:42,071
eventually,
you'll get "nebali."

225
00:08:42,071 --> 00:08:45,074
Neball...
the name of the planet

way... far away.

228
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,581
I'll tell you another thing.

229
00:08:51,581 --> 00:08:53,082
Once you step inside
this circle,

230

The weather never changes.

Allan: L... i love
to make people laugh,

235
00:09:06,095 --> 00:09:08,598
and i've been doing it
since...

236
00:09:08,598 --> 00:09:09,599
you know, school.

237
00:09:10,099 --> 00:09:12,101
People ask me,
"were you a..."

238
00:09:12,101 --> 00:09:16,105
you know, "you must have been
the class clown."

239
00:09:16,105 --> 00:09:20,109
And i say, uh,
"no, i wasrt."

240
00:09:20,109 --> 00:09:22,111
But i sat beside
the class clown,

241
00:09:22,612 --> 00:09:24,614
and I... i studied him,

242
00:09:24,614 --> 00:09:28,117
and, uh, and saw
how he made people laugh.

243
00:09:28,117 --> 00:09:31,120
And so i picked some things up,
and, uh, you know,

244
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,122
and at parties
and family functions,

245
00:09:33,122 --> 00:09:37,126
i have to say, i love,
you know, breaking people up.

246
00:09:37,126 --> 00:09:40,129
So, there's a thing
that i think i got...

247
00:09:40,129 --> 00:09:43,132
a... a... an entertaining bug

248
00:09:43,132 --> 00:09:46,636
from my grandfather, uh,
chaim progot

249
00:09:46,636 --> 00:09:50,640
who was very, very big
in the yiddish theater

250
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,641
back in new york.

251
00:09:52,141 --> 00:09:56,646

I said more ham.

253
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:03,653
And that revue,
i believe, was 1914,

254
00:10:03,653 --> 00:10:07,156
and that revue
is what made him famous.

255
00:10:07,156 --> 00:10:11,160
Incidentally, the song
bubbee made a kishke

256
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,662
came from that revue.

257

My... my father, bless him,

00:10:15,164 --> 00:10:17,166

into... into the business.

This was his dental practice,
uh, before,

and i joke with my wife
that, uh, you know,

261
00:10:23,172 --> 00:10:25,174
at that point,
that's when the, uh,

00:20:19,601 --> 00:20:24,106
virgin isles or
bahamanian or arubian.

479
00:20:24,606 --> 00:20:25,107
Yes.

480
00:20:25,607 --> 00:20:27,109
Mrs. Pearl:
Yeah, he's at his rehearsal.

481
00:20:27,109 --> 00:20:28,610
He's at his first rehearsal.

482
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:30,112
I don't know
what they're doing

483
00:20:30,112 --> 00:20:32,114
'cause i never been
to one before,

484
00:20:32,614 --> 00:20:35,617
but i bet they're introducing
themselves to each other.

485
00:20:35,617 --> 00:20:37,619
You know, it's gonna be nice

486
00:20:37,619 --> 00:20:39,621
to meet
some of these new folks,

487
00:20:39,621 --> 00:20:44,126
'cause we don't socialize
with the creative types.

488
00:20:44,126 --> 00:20:46,628
We got our scrabble club
and stuff,

489
00:20:46,628 --> 00:20:49,131
and, um, you know,

490
00:20:49,131 --> 00:20:51,633
and other people
with babies.

[Drumming and clapping]

492
00:20:57,139 --> 00:20:58,140
Right. Good.

493
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:01,143
Libby: Oh, the exercises
all mean something.

494
00:21:01,143 --> 00:21:03,645
Even if you don't know what.

495
00:21:04,146 --> 00:21:08,150
Dr. Pearl,
well, he'll come around,

496
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:13,655
and he'll learn like ron and
sheila and i have learned

497
00:21:13,655 --> 00:21:15,157
that corky has a vision.

Whoa! Whoa!

00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:25,167
Whoo!

501
00:21:27,169 --> 00:21:28,170
Oh!

502
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:30,172
You!
Forget about it! Ha ha!

503
00:21:30,172 --> 00:21:32,674
Ha ha! I went like this.

504
00:21:32,674 --> 00:21:35,177
Forget about it. Ha ha!

505
00:21:35,177 --> 00:21:36,678
With her it's ok,

506
00:21:36,678 --> 00:21:40,182
but with him,
he thought... ha ha!

507
00:21:40,182 --> 00:21:41,683
[Sighs]

508
00:21:41,683 --> 00:21:46,688
I, uh, i'm walking
on air, you know.

509
00:21:46,688 --> 00:21:49,691
This is a sensation
which is... forget it.

510
00:21:49,691 --> 00:21:52,194
When i became a dentist,
i thought i was happy,

511
00:21:52,194 --> 00:21:55,197
but this is... this is
making me nervous now,

512
00:21:55,197 --> 00:21:58,200
because i could have
wasted a lot of years.

513
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,702
I must say
i was very shocked to see

514
00:22:00,702 --> 00:22:02,704
that dr. Pearl had
actually been cast.

515
00:22:02,704 --> 00:22:04,206
Then i thought...

516
00:22:04,206 --> 00:22:06,708
we're in a glamor profession,
being travel agents,

517
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:09,211
and he isn't in
such a glamorous...

518
00:22:09,211 --> 00:22:11,213
one project,
we have to loosen him up.

519
00:22:11,213 --> 00:22:13,215
I have a feeling
he's a little tight.

520
00:22:13,215 --> 00:22:15,217
Particularly when
he's around us probably.

521
00:22:15,217 --> 00:22:16,218
I don't think
he'll mind jokes.

522
00:22:16,218 --> 00:22:17,219
You're intimidating,
ron...

523
00:22:17,219 --> 00:22:18,220
i can't help it.

524
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,222
Because you have
so much experience.

525
00:22:20,222 --> 00:22:22,224
Ron is going to help
everyone act,

526
00:22:22,224 --> 00:22:24,726
'cause i know
ron gives me...

527
00:22:24,726 --> 00:22:26,228
well, in all the productions
we've been in,

528
00:22:26,728 --> 00:22:28,230
and when we do scene studies
at home together,

529
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:31,233
ron will have extensive,

530
00:22:31,733 --> 00:22:34,236
you know, hour, 2-hour
sessions of notes for me,

531
00:22:34,236 --> 00:22:35,237
and it's so helpful.

532
00:22:35,737 --> 00:22:36,738
It's notes
for both of us.

533
00:22:36,738 --> 00:22:38,240
No, but lately...

534
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,241
you get most of them.

535
00:22:39,741 --> 00:22:41,243
He's trying to help me
to change my instincts

536
00:22:41,243 --> 00:22:42,611
or at least ignore them.

537
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:47,115
Corky: Listen,
let me tell you why i'm here.

538
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:50,118
We're doing a show.
I won't beat around the bush.

539
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:51,119
We're doing a show
that i've written

540
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:54,122
about the 150th anniversary
of blaine,

541
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:55,624
and i know
you're an old blainian.

542
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:57,125
Yes?

543
00:22:57,125 --> 00:23:00,128
And you're really right
for one of the parts.

544
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:03,131
It's the narrator
in the show.

545
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:04,633
One of the actor parts?

546
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:05,634
Yeah.

547
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:06,635
Oh, i don't know.

548
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:09,137
I've heard... i think
you're being modest

549
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:11,139
because i've heard
you've had some history

550
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:12,140
in show business.

551
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:16,144
Well, you know i did have,
i had a hankering

552
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:18,647
to be an actor
when i was a young fella,

553
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:20,148
when i got out of
the coast guard,

554
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:23,151
but i went to taxidermy
school instead.

555
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:24,653
Well, i took
a correspondence course.

556
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:25,654
Uh-huh.

557
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:27,656
I'll tell you something,
mr. Wooley,

558
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:31,660
what i'm looking for
in my shows are actors

559
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:34,162
and people that are
willing to work hard.

560
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:38,166
Well, yeah, i'm a hard worker
as you can see.

561
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:40,669
I love all the work
you've done.

562
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:45,173
That's a little gun rack
made out of deer hooves.

563
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:46,174
Oh, yeah.

564
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:48,677
Boy, i didn't know
deers could do that.

565
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:50,178
[Laughs]

566
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:55,684
Corky: I know this
comes out of left field,

567
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:57,185
but i'm looking
for another actor.

568
00:23:57,185 --> 00:24:00,188
And i was wondering
if you had any interest

569
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:02,691
in participating
in the show.

570
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:04,192
Does that appeal to you
in any way?

571
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:06,695
I'm not much of an actor,
i'm sorry.

572
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:09,698
I've never done that,
anything like that before.

573
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:11,700
Uh-huh.
Ok, fair enough,

574
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,202
but it might be
interesting, you know,

575
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:16,705
after, uh...
do you get off tonight?

576
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:18,206
What time do you
get off tonight?

577
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:20,208
Well, i get off at 8:00.

578
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:21,710
At 8:00 tonight?
Yeah.

579
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:24,212
Really? That's...
that's a long day.

580
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:25,213
Yeah.

581
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:27,215
Hey, dad,
this is, uh, mr...

St. Clair.

583
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:29,718
He's a drama guy.

584
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:32,220
Yeah, and, um, at 8:00
you're off, though?

585
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,722
Right.
Yeah.

586
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:36,224
I have to tell you i'm not
much of an actor or singer.

587
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:37,726
Well, you know what?

588
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:39,227
That's what
charles laughton said.

589
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:41,229
You know?
And look what happened.

590
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:44,733
Did you change the fan belt
on that blue chevy?

591
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:46,735
No, i haven't
done that yet.

592
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:49,738
When you get done here,
will you get on that?

593
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:50,739
Yeah.

594
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:53,742
Um, so,
how tall are you?

595
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:54,743
6'2".

596
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:56,244
Really?
Mm-hmm.

597
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:57,245
Wow.

598
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:02,717
Singers:
?? It's all the same??

599
00:25:02,717 --> 00:25:05,220
When we say, "nothing
ever happens in blaine,"

600
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:10,225
could we try you two
singing "blaine,"

601
00:25:10,725 --> 00:25:13,228
where we really hear
the "ne" at the end.

602
00:25:13,228 --> 00:25:16,731
And you guys just go,
"nothing ever happens in blai."

603
00:25:16,731 --> 00:25:18,733
Don't say the "ne."
They say the nes.

604
00:25:18,733 --> 00:25:20,235
And the same thing...
"nothing ever happens,

605
00:25:20,235 --> 00:25:22,237
it's all the same."

606
00:25:22,237 --> 00:25:24,239
And you sing,
"it's all the sa."

607
00:25:24,239 --> 00:25:25,740
Let's try it once,
ok, jean?

609

i know it's hard
to jump into this,

610
00:25:30,245 --> 00:25:32,247

like a, you know...

00:26:33,308 --> 00:26:34,809
Right.

636
00:26:34,809 --> 00:26:35,810
Robin in the nest.

637
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:37,812
Ok.

638
00:26:38,313 --> 00:26:39,314
Right.

639
00:26:39,314 --> 00:26:40,815
Good.

640
00:26:41,316 --> 00:26:42,317
This'll dominate the show.

641
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,322
?? By the pool??

642
00:26:47,322 --> 00:26:49,824
?? In the school
by the fires of yule??

643
00:26:49,824 --> 00:26:51,826
?? It's the rule??

644
00:26:51,826 --> 00:26:54,329
?? There's a stool,
there's a stool??

645
00:26:54,329 --> 00:26:55,830
?? Stools are where??

646
00:26:56,331 --> 00:26:58,833
?? Once upon a time
you'd find a chair??

647
00:26:58,833 --> 00:27:00,835
?? A chair's for fools??

648
00:27:00,835 --> 00:27:03,338
?? Everybody wants stools??

649
00:27:03,338 --> 00:27:05,340
?? Stool boom??

650
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:08,343
?? From the parlor
to the pool room??

651
00:27:08,343 --> 00:27:11,346
?
?? Everyone knows our name?

652
00:27:11,346 --> 00:27:12,847
Whose script
is that?

653
00:27:12,847 --> 00:27:14,349
?? Stool...??
Oh, sorry.

654
00:27:14,349 --> 00:27:15,850
No, drool.

655
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:17,352
?? You will...??
Oh, they're gonna be...

656
00:27:17,352 --> 00:27:18,353
?? Never stopping??

657
00:27:18,353 --> 00:27:19,854
?? Never breathing,
working??

658
00:27:23,358 --> 00:27:26,361
[Softly]
I don't want to interfere,

659
00:27:26,361 --> 00:27:29,364
but i think it would be...

660
00:27:30,865 --> 00:27:33,368
i think we have
to work on...

661
00:27:33,368 --> 00:27:34,369
i can't hear you.

662
00:27:34,369 --> 00:27:37,872
I think we have to work on
the music a little bit more.

663
00:27:37,872 --> 00:27:38,873
Fine.

664
00:27:38,873 --> 00:27:41,376
But i don't want
to make trouble, so...

665
00:27:41,376 --> 00:27:43,378
[whispering] and i don't
really want to do this

666
00:27:43,378 --> 00:27:45,380
in front of them,
but i think...

667
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:47,382
where do you
want to do it?

668
00:27:47,382 --> 00:27:51,386
Well, i think we have to
sit down and make a schedule

669
00:27:51,886 --> 00:27:54,389
that includes
some... some music time,

670
00:27:54,389 --> 00:27:57,892
'cause i think jean and i
have to work...

671
00:27:58,393 --> 00:27:59,894
why are you whispering?

672
00:27:59,894 --> 00:28:01,896
I'm right here,
you know? I don't...

673
00:28:02,397 --> 00:28:03,398
oh, i'm sorry.

674
00:28:03,398 --> 00:28:06,401
Do you want me
to talk louder?

675
00:28:06,401 --> 00:28:09,404
Because i think
that it would be...

676
00:28:09,404 --> 00:28:10,905
well,
now it's too loud.

677
00:28:10,905 --> 00:28:13,908
You know, just talk like
a normal person, ok?

678
00:28:13,908 --> 00:28:16,911
I think what they
were doing was good.

679
00:28:16,911 --> 00:28:18,413
To me, you rehearse,
you rehearse.

680
00:28:18,913 --> 00:28:20,915
You get it perfect. You know
exactly what you're doing.

681
00:28:21,416 --> 00:28:21,916
And then what?

682
00:28:22,417 --> 00:28:23,418
And then you
forget about it.

683
00:28:23,418 --> 00:28:24,419
Let me pinpoint you.

684
00:28:24,419 --> 00:28:25,920
You said they learn it,
they forget it,

685
00:28:26,421 --> 00:28:27,422
and that's ok?

686
00:28:27,422 --> 00:28:28,923
That's f... great.

687
00:28:28,923 --> 00:28:29,924
Well,
they've forgotten it...

688
00:28:29,924 --> 00:28:32,427
but they never learned it.
So when did they learn it?

689
00:28:32,427 --> 00:28:33,928
I'm just saying,
when do we have the time...

690
00:28:33,928 --> 00:28:34,929
but what i'm saying is,

691
00:28:34,929 --> 00:28:36,431
if they're gonna
forget it anyway,

692
00:28:36,431 --> 00:28:37,932
then what difference
does it make?

693
00:28:37,932 --> 00:28:40,935
You see what i mean?
It's like one of those...

694
00:28:40,935 --> 00:28:42,937
it's like a...
it's a zen thing.

695
00:28:42,937 --> 00:28:45,440
It's like, you know...
you know,

696
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,442
how many babies,
you know, fit

697
00:28:47,442 --> 00:28:48,943
in... in the tire thing?

698
00:28:49,444 --> 00:28:50,945
That whole...
the old joke, you know?

699
00:28:51,446 --> 00:28:53,948
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
No, you have a point.

700
00:28:54,449 --> 00:28:55,950
Uh, it's, you know,
an interesting point.

701
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:59,320
Ron: And how'd you
find this place?

702
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,823
Allan: Well,
we've... we've been, uh...

703
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:03,324
coming here for many,
many years.

704
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:04,826
Oh, yeah,
we come every thursday.

705
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:07,829
Well, with the rehearsals,
you won't be able to now.

706
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:08,830
This is true.

707
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:09,831
Ron:
You know, in china,

708
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:11,332
they'll kill a monkey
at the table

709
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:12,333
and split its head open,

710
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,335
eat the brains
right out of it.

711
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:17,839
We had friends...
ew.

712
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:19,841
Barbara and bruce,
remember?

713
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:21,342
Who went to, uh, china,
and i'm sure...

714
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:22,844
you're in
the travel business...

715
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:23,845
that you've been there,

716
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:26,347
but they went to peking,
where they make the ducks,

717
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:29,350
and what they say is
that the food over there

718
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:30,852
is not as good...

719
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:33,855
you can't get a sauce as
thick and sweet over there.

720
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:34,856
They don't make it
like that.

721
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:36,858
Their food is like
steamed or something.

722
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:38,359
And they should've
called you, because...

723
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:40,361
yeah, we got
some good packages.

724
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:41,362
Incidentally, if you two

725
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:42,864
ever want to get down
to miami, miami beach,

726
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:45,366
we got a great package.
A week, 2 weeks.

727
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:46,367
All expense... yeah.

728
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:48,369
You get everything
you need,

729
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:50,872
any kind of food
in blaine. You don't...

730
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:52,373
you know,
you get chinese here.

731
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:54,375
Uh, no need to go...

732
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:55,877
we're talking about
miami now, dear.

733
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:57,879
Yeah, we'd love to go.
We'd love to...

734
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:58,880
is it a direct?

735
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,881
A week, 2 weeks.

736
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:01,382
Like there aren't
chinese people in miami.

737
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:03,384
Allan: Well, we should.
You know, we've stopped...

738
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:04,385
what does that have to do...

739
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:05,887
of course there are
chinese people in miami.

740
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:06,888
We're talking
about china now.

741
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:08,389
I'm talking about
going to miami.

742
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:09,891
Miami. We're talking
about miami now.

743
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:11,893
Dear, why don't you put
some food on your stomach

744
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:12,894
before you have
any more wine?

745
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:14,896
What's it...
what's it...

746
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:17,398
shh. Girl talk.

747
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:20,401
What's it like to be
with a circumcised man?

748
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:22,403
Allan:
That is interesting.

749
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:25,406
I'd ask you more about
that, but ron said...

750
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:26,908
"that whole
jew thing's..."

751
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:28,910
aah.

752
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,912
'Cause when ron
had his surgery...

753
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:31,913
all right, all right,
all right.

754
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:33,414
When ron had
his surgery, i said,

755
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:34,916
"hey, circumcise it
while you're at it."

756
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:37,418
'Cause i had never been
with anyone else.

757
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:39,420
Rors the only man
i've been with.

758
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:41,923
Well, what surgery, uh...
did he have some major...

759
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:43,925
nothing. I had a little
minor corrective surgery.

760
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:45,426
Could we have some coffee
at this table, please?

761
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:47,428
It's not minor anymore.

762
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:48,429
[Clears throat]

763
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:49,931
Allan: Just...

764
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:52,934
well, maybe, you know,
we should change the subject.

765
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:56,437
I had what, you know,
most guys would, uh...

766
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:57,939
dream of, you know.

767
00:30:57,939 --> 00:31:01,442
And i had to have, uh,
penis-reduction surgery.

768
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:02,443
Allan: I'm sorry?

769
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:03,444
Penis reduction.

770
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:04,946
Which there aren't many.

771
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:05,947
You're gonna say,
"i never heard of that,"

772
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:07,448
'cause there haven't
been many cases.

773
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:09,450
I said,
"ron, do something."

774
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:12,453
And he said, "why don't
you get one of those...

775
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:13,454
vagina enlargements?"

776
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:15,456
Oh, dear! Could we have
some coffee over here?

777
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:17,458
Have you tried
the egg rolls?

778
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:18,960
Unbelievable.

779
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,461
Let me ask you something.
You're a medical man.

780
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:21,462
Allan: Yes.

781
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:23,464
I want to ask you
something. If you... you...

782
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:26,467
oh! Ohh,
for heavers sake! No!

783
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:27,969
No. No, please.
No! I just want...

784
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:29,470
doctor, please...

785
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:32,974
medicine man not go near
dances with stumpy. No.

786
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:34,776
Corky:
Everybody, everybody,

787
00:31:34,776 --> 00:31:37,779
i have a little
announcement to make.

788
00:31:37,779 --> 00:31:38,780
I wasrt gonna tell you.

789
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,782
I sent out 10 letters

790
00:31:40,782 --> 00:31:43,284
to different producers
in new york city.

791
00:31:43,284 --> 00:31:44,285
Ron: That's great.

792
00:31:44,285 --> 00:31:47,288
This is from

Wow. What does
this mean, corky?

808
00:32:24,826 --> 00:32:26,828
What it means is,

to broadway.

Ohh!

Oh, this is
great news!

00:32:36,337 --> 00:32:37,839
How about that?

00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:38,840
Did you hear that?

Libby: My aunt...
i brought out her atlas

816
00:32:41,843 --> 00:32:43,344
that i look at a lot,

817
00:32:43,344 --> 00:32:46,347
this big blue book,
and opened up to new york.

818
00:32:46,347 --> 00:32:48,850
And it's an island,
is really what it is.

819
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:52,353
It's this...
island full of people

820
00:32:52,353 --> 00:32:56,357
of different colors
and different ideas,

821
00:32:56,357 --> 00:32:59,360
and i can't... it sounds
like a lot of fun to me.

822
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:03,865
You know, we don't see
much of that in blaine.

823
00:33:03,865 --> 00:33:07,869
I'd like to maybe
meet some guys and...

824
00:33:07,869 --> 00:33:10,371
italian guys or...

825
00:33:10,371 --> 00:33:11,873
you know,
i've watched tv and stuff.

826
00:33:11,873 --> 00:33:14,876
L-i'm gonna be glad to do
the show on broadway,

827
00:33:14,876 --> 00:33:16,377
and there'll probably
be other offers.

00:33:16,377 --> 00:33:18,379
Mmm. Keeping
our fingers crossed.

829
00:33:18,379 --> 00:33:21,382
But i don't know if the theater
and the stage is for me.

830
00:33:21,382 --> 00:33:22,884
For one thing,

831
00:33:22,884 --> 00:33:24,886
there's an awful lot
of memorizing of lines,

832
00:33:24,886 --> 00:33:27,388
and i think... and i think...
you know what i'm thinking.

833
00:33:27,889 --> 00:33:29,390
Yeah. That's always
been in your way.

834
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:31,392
The ultimate goal...
hollywood.

835

Who was that?
Henry fonda.

841
00:33:43,905 --> 00:33:45,406
I always have to tell her
who i'm doing.

842
00:33:45,406 --> 00:33:47,909
She always laughs,
"now, who is that?"

843
00:33:47,909 --> 00:33:48,910
But i think, back there,

844
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:49,911
there's always
the germ in my mind

845
00:33:50,411 --> 00:33:52,413
that that's where i'd end up...
on the silver screen.

And you got the face
for it, too, darlir.

847
00:33:54,916 --> 00:33:56,417
You know, i want to try

848
00:33:56,417 --> 00:33:57,919
that "less is more"
kind of acting,

849
00:33:57,919 --> 00:33:59,921
where you just... when you're
talking to someone,

850
00:34:00,421 --> 00:34:02,423
you close your eyes,
and then you look at them

851
00:34:02,423 --> 00:34:03,925
when you're not
talking to the person.

852
00:34:03,925 --> 00:34:05,927
I mean, you open your eyes
when you're looking away,

853
00:34:05,927 --> 00:34:07,428
but then when you
talk to the person,

854
00:34:07,428 --> 00:34:08,930
you go like that.
And you open your eyes,

855
00:34:08,930 --> 00:34:09,931
and then you look back
at the person,

856
00:34:10,431 --> 00:34:11,933
but you never open your eyes
when you're talking to them.

857
00:34:11,933 --> 00:34:13,434
Corky: The guffman news
is really big,

858
00:34:13,434 --> 00:34:16,938
and, uh, i don't
truthfully think

859
00:34:16,938 --> 00:34:19,941
that the cast understand
how big.

860
00:34:20,441 --> 00:34:21,943
Um, they don't know
the new york thing.

861
00:34:21,943 --> 00:34:23,945
They haven't been
through it, and i have.

862
00:34:23,945 --> 00:34:26,447
You know, so it is kind of
on my shoulders,

863
00:34:26,948 --> 00:34:31,452
and... going to the big apple
for the first time,

864
00:34:31,452 --> 00:34:32,453
you know, is...

865
00:34:32,954 --> 00:34:34,956
such an experience.
You never forget it.

866
00:34:34,956 --> 00:34:36,958
It stays with you
for your whole life.

867
00:34:37,458 --> 00:34:38,960
Me, you know,
right out of the navy,

868
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,462
you know,
fresh off a destroyer,

869
00:34:41,462 --> 00:34:44,465
uh, with a dance belt and a tube
of chapstick, basically.

870
00:34:44,966 --> 00:34:46,968
You know, not really much
to call my own.

871
00:34:46,968 --> 00:34:49,971
And then basically
being slammed down

872
00:34:49,971 --> 00:34:52,473
for 10 or so years,
you know,

873
00:34:52,473 --> 00:34:54,976
off off off off broadway,

874
00:34:54,976 --> 00:34:57,979
and then enough is enough,
ok? I get the joke.

875
00:34:57,979 --> 00:35:00,982
And... is that gonna happen
again? I don't know.

876
00:35:00,982 --> 00:35:02,483
I mean, and i don't want it
to happen again.

877
00:35:02,483 --> 00:35:04,986
In my deepest,
deepest of hearts,

878
00:35:04,986 --> 00:35:06,988
i do not want it
to happen again.

879
00:35:06,988 --> 00:35:10,491
Mr. Guffman brings with him...
a reputation,

880
00:35:10,491 --> 00:35:13,995
something bigger than anyone
in this town has ever known,

881
00:35:14,495 --> 00:35:17,498
and if i am to get back
to new york city

882
00:35:17,498 --> 00:35:19,000
on my terms,

883
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,003
i cannot deliver him...
a stinky product.

884
00:35:22,003 --> 00:35:26,507
I really have to be
presenting him a package.

885
00:35:26,507 --> 00:35:31,512
A beautifully wrapped,
glossy, sweet-smelling show.

886
00:35:31,512 --> 00:35:35,016
What i need from you...

887
00:35:35,016 --> 00:35:38,019
because you're the bosses
of the town, essentially,

888
00:35:38,019 --> 00:35:39,020
and i know that...

889
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,521
is...

890
00:35:41,522 --> 00:35:43,024
this is so hard.

891
00:35:43,024 --> 00:35:45,026
I mean, there's nothing
easy about this.

892
00:35:45,026 --> 00:35:48,029
This is like when you're
getting your legs waxed,

893
00:35:48,029 --> 00:35:50,031
and they whip that thing off
real fast.

894
00:35:50,031 --> 00:35:52,533
That's what this is like.

895
00:35:52,533 --> 00:35:56,037
I need more money.

896
00:35:56,037 --> 00:35:58,039
Steve:
How much do you need?

897
00:35:58,039 --> 00:36:01,042
Steve's right. How much
are you thinking of, now?

898
00:36:01,042 --> 00:36:03,044
Ok. [sighs]

899
00:36:03,544 --> 00:36:05,046
What i need...

900
00:36:06,547 --> 00:36:08,549
is 100,000.

901
00:36:15,556 --> 00:36:17,058

00:36:18,059 --> 00:36:19,060
He is good.

904
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:20,061
He is.

905

Corky:
And let me explain,

906
00:36:22,063 --> 00:36:23,564
let me explain
what...

00:36:23,564 --> 00:36:24,565
go ahead.

for a second there.

Let me just explain
really what that entails.

911
00:36:31,572 --> 00:36:34,575
I bought it all the way,
by the way.

He's serious, glenn.

He's... he's not kidding?

914
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:40,081
Steve: Corky,
our entire budget

915
00:36:40,081 --> 00:36:43,084
for the entire year
is $15,000 for everything,

916
00:36:43,084 --> 00:36:45,586
and that includes
swimming.

917
00:36:45,586 --> 00:36:47,588
Well, i don't have any
swimming in my show.

918
00:36:47,588 --> 00:36:49,590
No, no. I mean the pool.
We have to keep up the pool.

919
00:36:50,091 --> 00:36:52,093
That's everything.
The entire year is 15,000.

920
00:36:52,093 --> 00:36:53,594
100,000?!

and all, glad you're here,

922
00:36:56,597 --> 00:37:00,601
but if i may be blunt...
what's wrong with you?

[sighs]

925
00:37:04,105 --> 00:37:05,606
So what i'm
understanding here,

926
00:37:05,606 --> 00:37:07,108
correct me if i'm wrong,

927
00:37:07,608 --> 00:37:10,611
is that you're not
giving me any money.

928
00:37:10,611 --> 00:37:12,613
So now i'm left
basically with nothing.

929
00:37:13,114 --> 00:37:15,616
I'm left with zero,

930
00:37:15,616 --> 00:37:17,618
in which... in which...
what can i do with zero?

931
00:37:17,618 --> 00:37:20,621
You know, what can I...
i can't do anything with it.

932
00:37:20,621 --> 00:37:22,623
This is my life here
we're talking about.

933

We're not just talking about,
you know, something else.

We're talking about
my life, you know?

935

And it's forcing me to do
something i don't want to do...

to leave,

937

and just leave and go home

You're not putting up
with these people."

And i'll tell you why
i can't put up with you people.

Because
you're bastard people.

I have to talk to you.

Good morning.
We have an announcement.

We have to talk. Ok?

Thank you. Dr. Pearl.

Please be quiet.
I have an announcement.

966
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:32,727
We've got to listen up here.

967

Excuse me, are we
gonna be vocalizing?

968
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:35,730
We will be vocalizing.

969

Before we start, i'd
like to clear my throat.

excuse me, please!

Everybody, let's be serious now
just for a moment,

974
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:49,744
and let's all listen up, ok?

975
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:53,247
Corky has left the show,
and i am taking over.

976
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:56,751
And what i want to do today
is start with some music,

977
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:59,253
do dancing,
and work on our lines.

978
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:01,255
And my hope is
at the end of 5 days,

979
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:02,757
we will know
what we're doing...

what do you mean?

981

And we will have a show.

Corky's left?

Ron: You mean he's left
for today or permanently?

984

Corky,
we love you!

something wrong.

When he went down,

we brought in the

to think about it,

and therefore,
i, you know, don't,

1038
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:21,896
because it's
a very healthy way

1039
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:24,899
to deal with something
that is ultimately

1040

not that important
in the long run.

they're real emotional,
and, um...

i think the important thing
about show-biz people

1047

is that you got to have
a-another life.

seen her.

that could be the problem.

do that.

because i am a fabin.

Ok, ok.

1072
00:42:43,611 --> 00:42:45,613

because i just know

that nobody
can touch, um...

take a nickel,

1078
00:42:56,624 --> 00:42:58,626
and you could make it
into a million dollars,

1079
00:42:58,626 --> 00:43:01,128

and we cannot lose that.

when you came to this town.

1081

Did you have
any budget then?

1082
00:43:04,632 --> 00:43:06,133
You didn't have
$100,000 then,

1083
00:43:06,133 --> 00:43:07,635
and look what happened
to that show.

And what aboutbackdraft?

1085
00:43:09,136 --> 00:43:10,638
You took a little bit
of cellophane,

1086
00:43:10,638 --> 00:43:12,139
and you made it
into flames!

You can still
feel the heat.

1088

You're not wrong.

to take your magic wand...

1090
00:43:18,646 --> 00:43:22,650
and wave it and make
this town special again,

Corky: In a funny way,
what the city council did

1116
00:44:19,206 --> 00:44:21,208
was really give me
a challenge,

1117

and it's a challenge
that i am going to accept.

1118

It's like in the olden days

Don't wear them

1149

It's mostly in
covered wagons,

1150
00:45:35,949 --> 00:45:36,950
because i think
that's the one

1151
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:40,454
where it's just not
as believable.

Nothing major. Nothing
that we can't solve.

1156
00:45:49,463 --> 00:45:51,965
One, um...

i don't see very well
without my glasses,

1159
00:45:57,971 --> 00:46:00,974

going to be a problem

1160

for me... just look out.

1161
00:46:03,477 --> 00:46:08,482
And the other thing
which is also a problem

1162
00:46:08,482 --> 00:46:11,985
is i have a very lazy eye

1163

is not a problem.

1172
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:42,382
I can get off
the horse like that,

1173
00:46:42,382 --> 00:46:43,383
but where
i'm having a problem

1174
00:46:43,383 --> 00:46:44,885
is that sometimes
the horse comes out

1175
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:47,387
and i can't
get past the cow.

1733
01:15:19,398 --> 01:15:23,902
low-fat or non-fat, um...

1734
01:15:23,902 --> 01:15:26,905
healthy...

1735

1736
01:15:28,857 --> 01:15:30,909
Corky:
The first thing i did

1737
01:15:31,410 --> 01:15:34,413
when i moved back
to new york city,

1738
01:15:34,413 --> 01:15:36,415
was to look up mr. Guffman.

1739
01:15:36,915 --> 01:15:39,418
And he was so sweet,

1740
01:15:39,418 --> 01:15:41,420
and i think he felt
a little guilty, too,

1741
01:15:41,420 --> 01:15:43,422
because he's
offered me the chance

1742
01:15:43,422 --> 01:15:45,924
to audition for
his new broadway show

1743
01:15:45,924 --> 01:15:48,927
which is a revival
ofmy fair lady.

1744
01:15:48,927 --> 01:15:50,929
It's one of my favorite
shows of all time.

1745
01:15:50,929 --> 01:15:54,933
And the role is
of 'enry 'iggins,

1746
01:15:54,933 --> 01:15:57,936
the somewhat-
stern-taskmaster-

1747
01:15:57,936 --> 01:16:00,939
but-he-really-likes-her-
anyway-kind-of-thing guy

1748
01:16:00,939 --> 01:16:03,942
who teaches eliza
to speak correctly.

1749
01:16:03,942 --> 01:16:06,945
And she of course is of
the cockney persuasion

1750
01:16:07,446 --> 01:16:08,947
and drops her hs.

1751
01:16:08,947 --> 01:16:10,449
And i've been
working on that at home,

1752
01:16:10,949 --> 01:16:13,952
the whole cockney thing of,
"'ello, 'ow are 'oo?"

1753
01:16:13,952 --> 01:16:15,954
"Do you want
to go to 'artford?"

1754
01:16:15,954 --> 01:16:19,458
"Not live in this 'ell'ole."
And that kind of thing.

1755
01:16:19,458 --> 01:16:21,960
I think i'm honing in on it
pretty close now.

1756
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:25,964
And i suppose that
the cake-and-eat-it-too part

1757
01:16:25,964 --> 01:16:27,466
of this whole story

1758
01:16:27,466 --> 01:16:29,968
is that another dream
of mine has come true,

1759
01:16:29,968 --> 01:16:32,471
which is that i've gotten
to open this shop...

1760
01:16:32,471 --> 01:16:35,974
where i have all
my show business treasures

1761
01:16:35,974 --> 01:16:37,976
and all my memorabilia.

1762
01:16:37,976 --> 01:16:41,480
This is without a doubt,
one of my favorite items.

1763
01:16:41,480 --> 01:16:45,984
Um, my dinner with andre
action figures,

1764
01:16:45,984 --> 01:16:48,487
and what you can do,
which is so cute,

1765
01:16:48,487 --> 01:16:51,990
is you can reenact
the whole scene.

1766
01:16:51,990 --> 01:16:55,994
You know, where the two guys
talk to each other

1767
01:16:55,994 --> 01:16:57,496
and say, you know...

1768
01:16:57,496 --> 01:17:00,499
"boy, i'm sure glad
you found a good restaurant.

1769
01:17:00,499 --> 01:17:02,501
"You know, it's so hard
these days to get in.

1770
01:17:02,501 --> 01:17:04,503
Who do you know?"

1771
01:17:04,503 --> 01:17:06,505
"Oh, i just called.

1772
01:17:06,505 --> 01:17:09,508
Made a call.
Spur of the moment."

1773
01:17:09,508 --> 01:17:13,011
"Ha ha! Oh, you, you can
always get a reservation."

1774
01:17:13,512 --> 01:17:16,515
You know.
That's not from the movie,

1775
01:17:16,515 --> 01:17:18,016
but you can make up
your own dialogue,

1776
01:17:18,016 --> 01:17:20,018
which is one of the great things
about action figures.

1777
01:17:20,018 --> 01:17:22,888
I'm trying to get...
it's very rare...

fordas boot,

1779
01:17:27,392 --> 01:17:30,896

whole claustrophobic thing

das mushtenstein."

1782
01:17:36,401 --> 01:17:37,402
That whole german thing.

1783
01:17:37,903 --> 01:17:39,905
Can't speak german,
but it sounds like

1784
01:17:39,905 --> 01:17:42,407
sort of a bunch
of barnyard animals,

1785
01:17:42,407 --> 01:17:45,410
"muck, muck, muck,"
making that noise and sweatir.

01:17:45,410 --> 01:17:49,915

these are my big heads,

there's andrew mccan'thy.

1791
01:18:00,425 --> 01:18:04,429
Over here, some new lunchboxes
we've gotten in,

the remains of the day
lunchbox,

1793

and the kids,
they're just having

1794
01:18:08,433 --> 01:18:10,435
such a good time
with these, you know.

1795
01:18:10,435 --> 01:18:12,938
Kids don't like
eating lunch at school,

1796
01:18:12,938 --> 01:18:14,940
but if they're got
aremains of the daylunchbox,

1797
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:16,441
they're a whole lot happier.
