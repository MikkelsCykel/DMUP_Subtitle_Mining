1
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,077
<i>Every time I hold you</i>

2
00:00:32,484 --> 00:00:34,315
<i>There's a feeling</i>

3
00:00:36,254 --> 00:00:39,314
<i>You know, it's a feeling that pulls me in</i>

4
00:00:39,391 --> 00:00:42,986
<i>Deeper and deeper into your mind</i>

5
00:00:44,463 --> 00:00:46,988
<i>Every time</i>

6
00:00:47,065 --> 00:00:51,730
<i>And I want more and more until they stop</i>

7
00:00:51,804 --> 00:00:55,001
<i>Oh, there's something about you, baby</i>

8
00:00:56,042 --> 00:00:58,442
<i>You're all I need</i>

9
00:00:58,511 --> 00:01:02,948
<i>Slip into something
more comfortable. Hawksin Hotels.</i>

10
00:01:04,617 --> 00:01:07,950
<i>You're everything to me</i>

11
00:01:09,922 --> 00:01:13,085
We think it really brands the chain.

12
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:16,560
Hedonistic opulence. Pampering.

13
00:01:17,563 --> 00:01:20,896
The place to go
when you're with someone special.

14
00:01:24,604 --> 00:01:26,162
Well. I think it's perfect.

15
00:01:27,473 --> 00:01:29,805
Lf. By "perfect. " you mean low-rent porn

16
00:01:29,876 --> 00:01:32,471
that's completely inappropriate
for me or my hotels.

17
00:01:32,546 --> 00:01:33,604
Even the chocolate was naked.

18
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,080
- We could lose the chocolate.
- Why are you speaking?

19
00:01:36,149 --> 00:01:38,379
- Stop speaking. Why is he speaking?
- I don't know.

20
00:01:38,452 --> 00:01:40,613
You know what let's do?
When I'm speaking. You stop speaking.

21
00:01:40,687 --> 00:01:42,120
- Right.
- He did it again.

22
00:01:47,661 --> 00:01:48,650
Mike?

23
00:01:50,531 --> 00:01:51,555
Well put.

24
00:01:51,632 --> 00:01:53,224
Look. Fellows.
I don't want my customers thinking

25
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,530
about what their bed was doing
before they got in it.

26
00:01:55,602 --> 00:01:57,627
On the good side.
The pastries were delicious.

27
00:01:57,704 --> 00:01:59,069
<i>Amici.</i>

28
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,771
<i>A vanti.</i>

29
00:02:04,711 --> 00:02:05,735
Mr. Hawksin?

30
00:02:05,946 --> 00:02:08,346
The passion angle was something that
we decided on months ago.

31
00:02:08,415 --> 00:02:10,076
Apparently. We define the word differently.

32
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:12,449
Have you ever even stayed
at a Hawksin hotel?

33
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,318
Because judging from what I saw in there.
You have no idea what we believe in.

34
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:20,259
I've never actually stayed
in a Hawksin hotel per se. But...

35
00:02:20,328 --> 00:02:21,818
And what about the international angle?

36
00:02:21,896 --> 00:02:23,796
We decided we would go
for global business.

37
00:02:23,865 --> 00:02:27,323
Exactly. I'm with you. Sir. Great idea.

38
00:02:27,402 --> 00:02:32,499
Today's business needs to attract
a wider customer base.

39
00:02:32,574 --> 00:02:35,543
- Please. Sir. We can do this.
- Again with the talking.

40
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:40,638
All right. This isn't the first time
a tryst in a hotel room didn't go well.

41
00:02:40,715 --> 00:02:42,842
But just give us one more shot.

42
00:02:42,917 --> 00:02:44,976
If we don't make a commercial
that tells the whole world

43
00:02:45,053 --> 00:02:47,783
exactly who Hawksin Hotels really is.

44
00:02:47,855 --> 00:02:49,914
Well. Then I'll...

45
00:02:49,991 --> 00:02:52,619
We'll both quit the business forever.

46
00:02:54,363 --> 00:02:56,729
Scout's honor. You have my word.

47
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,558
And my passion.

48
00:03:00,402 --> 00:03:02,836
- Passion.
Again with the talking.

49
00:03:03,672 --> 00:03:05,299
You see Mike. Here?

50
00:03:05,374 --> 00:03:10,402
He's worked for me for 37 years.
And hasn't said one word the whole time.

51
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:11,503
I'll tell you what.

52
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,844
We're opening a new five-star restaurant
at the Hawksin Grand

53
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:15,679
in San Francisco next week.
You're both invited.

54
00:03:15,751 --> 00:03:18,413
You'll come up.
Get a feel for the place. If you can.

55
00:03:18,487 --> 00:03:22,082
Call the office. They'll set it up.
"Leave the business. "

56
00:03:22,157 --> 00:03:23,715
Thank you. Sir.

57
00:03:26,662 --> 00:03:30,621
What did I tell you about the girl
climbing on the guy's lap like that?

58
00:03:30,699 --> 00:03:32,564
What? It was tasteful.

59
00:03:35,104 --> 00:03:36,936
I need to see the proofs before
you send them to LA. Before...

60
00:03:37,007 --> 00:03:38,531
Call Ted Stevens' new agent.
See if Ted can shoot a spot

61
00:03:38,608 --> 00:03:39,666
10 days from now.
Also. There was that video...

62
00:03:39,743 --> 00:03:41,005
Messenger the Milan samples
to Granger's apartment.

63
00:03:41,077 --> 00:03:42,374
...performance artist.
He was a New School graduate?

64
00:03:42,445 --> 00:03:44,003
- I want to see those tonight.
- I don't remember his name.

65
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,342
- But find him and give me his reel.
- Yeah. Okay.

66
00:03:45,415 --> 00:03:46,473
Yeah. Thanks.

67
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:49,785
I've got one more shot with Hawksin.

68
00:03:49,853 --> 00:03:52,913
If we don't get this account. I don't know
if Charlie and I are gonna make it.

69
00:03:52,989 --> 00:03:53,978
Don't worry about it.

70
00:03:54,057 --> 00:03:57,151
International angle?
What does that even mean?

71
00:03:57,227 --> 00:03:59,457
You'll come up with something.
You always do.

72
00:04:02,465 --> 00:04:04,626
Hello. Yeah. That's me.

73
00:04:06,369 --> 00:04:08,132
I'm not interested.

74
00:04:08,872 --> 00:04:10,066
CITYone Bank.

75
00:04:11,307 --> 00:04:14,606
I was afraid it was another woman
who heard about your imminent success.

76
00:04:14,678 --> 00:04:17,648
I didn't think Emory Banks
had a jealous bone in her body.

77
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:19,376
Over shoes and careers. Yes.

78
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:21,577
Other women. Not so much.

79
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:26,254
- You're amazing.
- I know.

80
00:04:27,425 --> 00:04:30,917
Mr. Woodruff. I'm afraid
your card's been declined.

81
00:04:30,995 --> 00:04:31,984
Really?

82
00:04:33,164 --> 00:04:35,632
Just give me a minute. Yeah?

83
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:39,158
<i>Mr. Woodruff, this is Jennifer David
from CITYone Bank calling again.</i>

84
00:04:39,236 --> 00:04:41,727
<i>Please don't hang up, sir,
we seem to have a situation.</i>

85
00:04:41,806 --> 00:04:44,468
Yeah. It's more of a train wreck. Actually.
I just tried to use my card.

86
00:04:44,542 --> 00:04:46,237
<i>We've frozen it for your protection.</i>

87
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:49,473
Our fraud division has picked up
more than $28.000 in charges

88
00:04:49,547 --> 00:04:51,674
within the last 10 days to your account.

89
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:53,580
- Holy shit!
- What is going on?

90
00:04:53,651 --> 00:04:56,051
<i>- It's $28,422...
- Somebody stole my card number.</i>

91
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,020
...and 48 cents. To be exact.

92
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:00,650
<i>- So I take it these aren't yours?
- Yeah.</i>

93
00:05:00,726 --> 00:05:02,751
- I mean. No. No.
- That should work.

94
00:05:02,828 --> 00:05:04,022
- Hey. Hold on.
- Thank you.

95
00:05:04,096 --> 00:05:06,326
I've got this.
Just give me a minute.

96
00:05:06,398 --> 00:05:07,888
- Mr. Granger?
- Yeah.

97
00:05:07,966 --> 00:05:10,127
I just need to verify
some of these charges.

98
00:05:10,669 --> 00:05:14,537
Jessica. This isn't really a good time.
Why don't you call me tomorrow morning?

99
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:16,972
It's Jennifer. Actually.

100
00:05:17,409 --> 00:05:20,139
<i>Jennifer David. And I can call you then.</i>

101
00:05:20,679 --> 00:05:21,941
<i>Please don't try to use your...</i>

102
00:05:23,148 --> 00:05:24,445
Let's go.

103
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:42,328
Doesn't little Granger want
to come out and play?

104
00:05:42,401 --> 00:05:43,800
No. Little Granger's tired.

105
00:05:48,941 --> 00:05:51,000
Sorry. It's probably work.

106
00:05:51,477 --> 00:05:53,240
<i>- Hello?
Mr. Woodruff?</i>

107
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:55,246
<i>- Speaking.
- This is Jennifer David</i>

108
00:05:55,314 --> 00:05:57,748
<i>from CITYone Bank Card. It's 8:00 AM.</i>

109
00:05:57,817 --> 00:05:59,717
Oh. Right. My wake-up call.

110
00:05:59,786 --> 00:06:00,775
<i>Good morning, sir.</i>

111
00:06:00,853 --> 00:06:02,252
<i>- Now, we need to establish...
- This is important. Em.</i>

112
00:06:02,321 --> 00:06:04,983
<i>- ... which of these charges are fraudulent.
- Do you want to get off the phone?</i>

113
00:06:05,057 --> 00:06:06,285
<i>First, if you wouldn't mind
answering a few questions.</i>

114
00:06:06,359 --> 00:06:07,451
<i>Your mother's maiden name?</i>

115
00:06:07,527 --> 00:06:08,585
I can't believe you. Just hang up.

116
00:06:08,661 --> 00:06:10,151
- Klinger. No.
- Okay.

117
00:06:10,229 --> 00:06:12,595
Strike that. That was
her second husband. Winslow.

118
00:06:12,665 --> 00:06:15,759
<i>- Is this a bad time, sir?
- Yes. It is.</i>

119
00:06:15,835 --> 00:06:18,167
Sorry about that. Ms. David.
That was my maid.

120
00:06:18,237 --> 00:06:21,172
She was being naughty. Please continue.

121
00:06:22,075 --> 00:06:25,238
Okay.
Can you list your last three purchases?

122
00:06:25,312 --> 00:06:26,336
Let's see.

123
00:06:27,114 --> 00:06:29,275
<i>I bought an iPod a few days ago
for the gym,</i>

124
00:06:29,349 --> 00:06:32,284
took a potential client to Pete's.
Best ribs in town.

125
00:06:32,352 --> 00:06:34,786
You'll probably see that charge
on my card a lot.

126
00:06:34,855 --> 00:06:39,155
<i>Do you remember a charge of $250
at Lotus Florists, four days ago?</i>

127
00:06:39,226 --> 00:06:42,389
- I didn't get any flowers.
- No. Not mine.

128
00:06:42,462 --> 00:06:45,329
<i>They were delivered to a Ms. Leslie Moore.</i>

129
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:47,867
- Ms. Leslie "We're just friends" Leslie?
- Em.

130
00:06:47,935 --> 00:06:50,062
...O- O-R-E. That's right.

131
00:06:50,137 --> 00:06:52,697
Her mother was sick.
She just passed the bar.

132
00:06:52,773 --> 00:06:56,004
- Flowers are very thoughtful.
- You're killing me here. David.

133
00:06:56,076 --> 00:06:59,739
- Em. You're not leaving. Are you?
- Whatever.

134
00:06:59,813 --> 00:07:01,508
<i>- Okay, now, Mr. Woodruff...
I'm gonna have Emily come by</i>

135
00:07:01,582 --> 00:07:03,881
<i>- and get things. All right?
- I'm going to fax you a print-out</i>

136
00:07:03,952 --> 00:07:06,887
<i>of all these charges. Circle the ones
that are yours, and then fax it back to me.</i>

137
00:07:07,622 --> 00:07:09,112
Great.

138
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:11,988
At least tell me it's not raining again.
Is it nice out?

139
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,460
I don't know. Sir. I'm in San Francisco.

140
00:07:14,529 --> 00:07:16,963
SF. You know. City by the Bay.

141
00:07:17,031 --> 00:07:21,468
Home of the 49ers. Golden Gate Bridge.
Cable cars...

142
00:07:26,074 --> 00:07:27,200
May I help you?

143
00:07:33,748 --> 00:07:36,581
This is Jennifer David
from CITYone Bank Card calling.

144
00:07:36,651 --> 00:07:37,743
548...

145
00:07:37,819 --> 00:07:38,979
420...

146
00:07:43,424 --> 00:07:44,618
Call you tonight?

147
00:07:46,362 --> 00:07:48,353
But I need you to really try to...

148
00:07:50,633 --> 00:07:51,759
Please don't hang up. Sir...

149
00:07:51,834 --> 00:07:53,096
All right. Sir. I'd be happy to help you.

150
00:07:55,671 --> 00:07:57,263
That should take care of it for now.

151
00:07:57,539 --> 00:07:59,166
That's it for me.

152
00:07:59,975 --> 00:08:01,840
That was my 42nd hang-up tonight.

153
00:08:01,911 --> 00:08:06,348
I've had like four "Get lost. Idiots. "
And 16 "Lose my number. Morons. "

154
00:08:06,415 --> 00:08:09,509
And I think this guy just called me
a douchebag. What's that?

155
00:08:09,585 --> 00:08:10,677
I don't know.

156
00:08:10,753 --> 00:08:13,483
I'm so happy they moved me
to Lost or Stolen.

157
00:08:13,555 --> 00:08:15,216
You're so lucky.

158
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:17,555
Do you want to go for shopping
before it gets too crowded?

159
00:08:17,626 --> 00:08:20,390
- Okay.
- You know. I have to go to Vikram's house

160
00:08:20,462 --> 00:08:23,158
this Sunday. And Papa told me
to get a new dress.

161
00:08:23,232 --> 00:08:26,224
- Wow!
- He said. "Every time the Bhatias see you

162
00:08:26,302 --> 00:08:28,601
"in jeans. I'm afraid
they're beginning to think

163
00:08:28,672 --> 00:08:30,765
"that their future daughter-in-law
is a boy!"

164
00:08:31,608 --> 00:08:32,939
Your father has a point.

165
00:08:33,009 --> 00:08:35,807
Vikram comes from a very good family.
You should impress them.

166
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:38,245
- You're killing me here.
- I'm what?

167
00:08:38,315 --> 00:08:40,510
It's a slang.
You need to pay attention in class.

168
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:42,778
Teacher's pest?

169
00:09:21,926 --> 00:09:24,861
The toilet is going up. You just watch it.

170
00:09:26,364 --> 00:09:27,422
Good. You're here.

171
00:09:27,498 --> 00:09:30,399
<i>Priya. beta, you know
father was saying that...</i>

172
00:09:30,468 --> 00:09:33,995
Mama. Please. Let me sleep.
Good night. Please.

173
00:09:34,672 --> 00:09:36,697
In that case. Good night.

174
00:09:45,049 --> 00:09:47,313
Okay. I got one. "From the food

175
00:09:48,853 --> 00:09:50,378
"to the toilet paper.

176
00:09:51,189 --> 00:09:53,123
"Hawksin's means quality. "

177
00:09:56,294 --> 00:09:58,421
Yeah. That's really bad.

178
00:10:00,198 --> 00:10:03,099
"If you're tired
and you need a place to sleep... "

179
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:05,427
I've got nothing.

180
00:10:05,537 --> 00:10:08,768
"People who stay with Hawksin's
are smarter than when they check out.

181
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,273
"Than when they check in. "

182
00:10:10,342 --> 00:10:12,776
No. No. No. No.
That doesn't make any sense.

183
00:10:19,017 --> 00:10:22,544
Govinda. Go get your sister.
Otherwise she'll be late for work.

184
00:10:22,621 --> 00:10:26,057
- Shh. Ma. I'm watching cricket.
- Govinda!

185
00:10:27,025 --> 00:10:29,585
Okay. Okay. Priya. Wake up!

186
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:33,524
- Priya. You'll be late for work.
- Look at this boy. Huh?

187
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,066
- Priya!
- All the time. He's watching these

188
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,260
- terrible programs on television.
- Yes!

189
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:39,268
These cricket hoodlums.
And he behaves like that.

190
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:41,272
- Good morning.
- Ah! It's your morning.

191
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,968
It's our evening. Huh?
Your dinner's almost ready.

192
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:46,273
You're not wearing those boys' pants
to the Bhatias'. Are you?

193
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:49,109
I have a dress. Don't worry.
And what is this?

194
00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:52,310
Ah! That's a birthday present
for your father's cousin. Auntie Rani.

195
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:54,546
And Govinda has to take it
to the post soon.

196
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:57,783
Otherwise it won't make it on time
to Palo Alto. Right. Govinda?

197
00:10:57,857 --> 00:10:59,916
- Yeah. Ma.
- Mmm-hmm. Right.

198
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:03,785
You're back? Any good news?

199
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:07,861
I went all the way to Mud Island.
They were not even at home.

200
00:11:07,934 --> 00:11:09,231
I don't want to talk about it.

201
00:11:09,302 --> 00:11:11,463
- What's the score?
- 121 for six.

202
00:11:11,537 --> 00:11:14,803
Sounds like my day.
- Hi. Papa. How was your day?

203
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:17,070
I don't want to talk about it.

204
00:11:17,144 --> 00:11:19,704
Another night without a family dinner.

205
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:22,180
If you sat down with me now.
We could eat together.

206
00:11:22,249 --> 00:11:24,149
Just because you have to work
all night out

207
00:11:24,218 --> 00:11:27,016
doesn't mean that I have my dinner
at 5:30 in the evening.

208
00:11:27,087 --> 00:11:29,078
<i>If you read India Today this week.</i>

209
00:11:29,156 --> 00:11:31,920
It talks about
how we are the future of India.

210
00:11:31,992 --> 00:11:34,756
And. You know.
Some 10.000 people applied for the job.

211
00:11:34,828 --> 00:11:38,229
And only 100 were accepted.
And I'm making good money.

212
00:11:38,298 --> 00:11:40,357
Even though it's not normal
for a young woman like you

213
00:11:40,434 --> 00:11:42,766
to work all night on the phone.
Talking to strangers.

214
00:11:42,836 --> 00:11:46,328
<i>- Pretending to be Americano.
- Yes. Yes!</i>

215
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,536
We did it! We scored!

216
00:11:50,611 --> 00:11:52,408
Like being Indian is so normal.

217
00:11:59,554 --> 00:12:01,146
All right. I got some more.

218
00:12:01,222 --> 00:12:04,680
- Next.
- "Our mini-bars will get you maxi-drunk. "

219
00:12:04,792 --> 00:12:06,157
Oh. My gosh.

220
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,918
Okay. Let's start with your celebrities.

221
00:12:40,729 --> 00:12:42,390
Sarah Michelle Gellar.
- Sarah Michelle Gellar.

222
00:12:42,464 --> 00:12:44,227
Sarah Michelle Gellar. Good. Next.

223
00:12:46,068 --> 00:12:48,434
Sarah Jessica Parker.
- Sarah Jessica Parker.

224
00:12:48,504 --> 00:12:49,994
Sarah Jessica Parker. Good.

225
00:12:54,743 --> 00:12:58,679
Mary-Louise Parker.
That was in your handout.

226
00:12:59,381 --> 00:13:00,541
All right?

227
00:13:02,284 --> 00:13:04,616
That is Dylan...

228
00:13:04,687 --> 00:13:06,416
That's Dermot Mulroney.

229
00:13:06,488 --> 00:13:09,980
<i>Not to be confused with Dylan McDermott.
Formerly of The Practice.</i>

230
00:13:10,059 --> 00:13:11,583
Very good. Priya.

231
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:16,654
Okay. Tonight. I want you to study
your Jessicas and your Ryans. Okay?

232
00:13:16,732 --> 00:13:19,361
- Lf somebody calls you a dawg?
That's good.

233
00:13:19,436 --> 00:13:22,269
- Right. But if you dog somebody?
That's bad.

234
00:13:22,339 --> 00:13:23,863
Word. Okay.

235
00:13:24,975 --> 00:13:29,412
Who makes the square burger?
Is it Wendy's. Burger King or McDonald's?

236
00:13:29,479 --> 00:13:30,912
Burger King.

237
00:13:32,616 --> 00:13:33,742
Wendy's. Zia.

238
00:13:34,584 --> 00:13:36,950
Wendy's makes the square burger.

239
00:13:38,255 --> 00:13:40,416
Burger King is Home of the Whopper.

240
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:45,427
And McDonald's is famous
for its Quarter Pounder. With or...

241
00:13:45,729 --> 00:13:48,027
- Without cheese.
... without cheese. Good.

242
00:13:48,098 --> 00:13:49,463
- Yes. Priya.
- But many of them

243
00:13:49,532 --> 00:13:52,160
are starting to add salads
and low-fat chicken dishes.

244
00:13:52,235 --> 00:13:54,669
Because of the obesity
which is plaguing the country.

245
00:13:54,738 --> 00:13:57,172
Good. Okay. That's it. Everybody.

246
00:13:57,507 --> 00:14:00,773
Sunday. I want all those
from the Southwest here at 6:00. please.

247
00:14:00,845 --> 00:14:03,279
And Californians. Monday at 5:30.

248
00:14:03,347 --> 00:14:05,679
And New Jersey.
Everyone here at 8:00. please.

249
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,342
- Ms. Prasad?
- Yes. Zia.

250
00:14:07,418 --> 00:14:10,615
May I please move out of New Jersey?
Everyone keeps swearing at me.

251
00:14:10,688 --> 00:14:14,624
Zia. You know the rules.
Everyone starts in New Jersey.

252
00:14:14,692 --> 00:14:16,751
And works their way out.

Therefore. You are not sick.

268
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:25,554
Hello.

269
00:15:25,631 --> 00:15:27,064
<i>Mr. Woodruff, this is Jennifer David</i>

270
00:15:27,133 --> 00:15:29,158
from CITYone Bank. How are you?

271
00:15:29,602 --> 00:15:32,196
- I'm sick.
- Oh. I'm sorry.

272
00:15:32,271 --> 00:15:35,798
<i>- If this is a bad time...

It's just. I'm...

274
00:15:43,249 --> 00:15:44,807
He's sneezing.

275
00:15:44,884 --> 00:15:47,182
He's allergic to you.
Just put down the phone.

276
00:15:47,754 --> 00:15:49,085
<i>Maybe I should call you later, sir...</i>

277
00:15:49,155 --> 00:15:52,522
I don't have time to be sick today. David.
I gotta nail this thing.

278
00:15:52,859 --> 00:15:54,224
He's building something.

279
00:15:55,461 --> 00:15:59,420
If you want to feel better right away
then try sucking on a lemon.

280
00:15:59,499 --> 00:16:03,196
Then drinking a tall glass of warm water
with cardamom and fresh ginger.

281
00:16:05,038 --> 00:16:06,562
I'll try that.

282
00:16:06,707 --> 00:16:10,074
I'll call you back later. Sir.
Good luck with your nailing.

283
00:16:11,111 --> 00:16:12,135
Bye!

<i>There's a magic in you

285
00:16:30,264 --> 00:16:33,165
- We going late tonight?
- Not tonight.

286
00:16:33,233 --> 00:16:36,566
I've got to get home early.
Make some comfort food. Get some sleep.

287
00:16:36,637 --> 00:16:38,502
Get better for tomorrow.

288
00:16:38,572 --> 00:16:39,766
I got cleared for tonight.

289
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,774
Now I've got to check with Karen
about tomorrow?

290
00:16:41,842 --> 00:16:45,437
- Spoken like a true married man.
- Hey. It could happen to you. Too.

291
00:16:45,512 --> 00:16:49,142
Didn't Emory make the
"Top 20 Hottest Women in New York" list?

292
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:50,479
We're just having fun. Pal. Okay?

293
00:16:50,552 --> 00:16:52,816
Don't drag me
into your own little personal hell.

294
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:55,048
The guys that say
they don't want to get married.

295
00:16:55,123 --> 00:16:57,421
They're the ones who surprise you.

296
00:16:57,492 --> 00:16:59,983
So. Since you've been
on the wedding bandwagon since day one.

297
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:02,154
You must secretly dread the actual event.

298
00:17:02,263 --> 00:17:06,165
- You know. There's still time to back out.
- I'm not you.

299
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:09,294
What the hell are you drinking?
It smells like an Indian restaurant.

300
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:12,100
Cold remedy.
Credit-card girl told me about it.

301
00:17:13,374 --> 00:17:15,934
Still can't believe
someone stole your identity.

302
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:18,501
I mean. Of all the identities out there
to steal. Who'd want to steal yours?

303
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:24,775
- Hope they're living large on your dime.
- Nice. Good friend.

304
00:17:43,572 --> 00:17:47,941
There was an attempt to use your card
for $700 at the Mystery Box.

305
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:49,773
Seriously?

306
00:17:49,845 --> 00:17:52,211
Unless you throw in a night
with the cashier and some dolls.

307
00:17:52,281 --> 00:17:53,714
How do you spend that much
at a store like that?

308
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:56,114
I don't know what kind of store it is. Sir.

309
00:17:56,185 --> 00:17:58,813
Oh. Come on.
They don't have them in San Francisco?

310
00:18:02,758 --> 00:18:05,727
Yeah. Sure.

311
00:18:06,695 --> 00:18:09,995
Which is why I was certain
this wasn't your charge.

312
00:18:10,834 --> 00:18:13,200
Because I don't give off
a sexually adventurous vibe?

313
00:18:14,971 --> 00:18:16,131
No.

314
00:18:16,573 --> 00:18:18,973
Because you were sneezing profusely
into my eardrums

315
00:18:19,042 --> 00:18:21,875
about the time the charge was made.

316
00:18:21,945 --> 00:18:23,913
Nice work. Detective David.

317
00:18:24,414 --> 00:18:27,611
Okay. The big plasma TV charge.
That's mine.

318
00:18:27,684 --> 00:18:29,652
You know. Sometimes
you just have to splurge

319
00:18:29,719 --> 00:18:32,187
and get yourself something
that you enjoy. Live a little.

320
00:18:32,255 --> 00:18:34,849
Especially after a long day at the office.

321
00:18:34,925 --> 00:18:38,156
<i>I just have a cup of chai. I mean. Coffee.</i>

322
00:18:40,297 --> 00:18:42,697
You're not fooling anyone.

323
00:18:42,766 --> 00:18:47,999
You Californians are all into your tofu
and your sandals.

324
00:18:48,071 --> 00:18:49,732
You're probably a Dead Head.

325
00:18:51,309 --> 00:18:53,038
Am I right. Dude?

326
00:18:53,344 --> 00:18:55,574
Actually. I just prefer jazz.

327
00:18:57,348 --> 00:19:00,146
All right. Here's the question.

328
00:19:00,217 --> 00:19:04,916
Jalapenos in your grilled cheese.
Kicker or overkill?

329
00:19:08,426 --> 00:19:10,917
- Kicker?
- Absolutely.

330
00:19:22,573 --> 00:19:25,736
<i>Hello? You still there?</i>

331
00:19:28,446 --> 00:19:30,573
And the charge to Delicious Delights?

332
00:19:30,648 --> 00:19:32,879
Biggest amaretto cake known to man.

333
00:19:32,951 --> 00:19:35,078
My mother was having a lousy week.

334
00:19:35,153 --> 00:19:39,385
Sometimes you just want
to show someone you care. Right?

335
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:41,016
Right.

336
00:19:41,093 --> 00:19:45,496
Okay. The last one. Um...
The charges from New World Video.

337
00:19:47,366 --> 00:19:51,427
<i>Those were late fees.
I rented The Notebook. Don't laugh.</i>

338
00:19:52,404 --> 00:19:55,498
Why would I laugh? I love that movie.

339
00:19:55,574 --> 00:19:57,007
<i>I don't normally watch chick flicks,</i>

340
00:19:57,075 --> 00:19:59,305
and I don't even know
if that classifies as one.

341
00:19:59,378 --> 00:20:03,212
But you ever watch a movie and just think
that's the way things should be?

342
00:20:04,116 --> 00:20:08,348
Like. Someone puts themselves out there
for someone or something.

343
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:11,651
And either they get it or they don't.

344
00:20:11,723 --> 00:20:12,985
But love's worth it.

345
00:20:14,293 --> 00:20:16,784
Hi. This is Courtney Reese from CITYone.
May I help you?

346
00:20:16,863 --> 00:20:19,457
I think that will
take care of it for now.

347
00:20:19,532 --> 00:20:22,990
<i>If any more charges come in,
I'll be in touch with you.</i>

348
00:20:23,069 --> 00:20:24,366
Great.

349
00:20:24,437 --> 00:20:28,066
I failed to mention that you qualify
for our platinum card.

350
00:20:28,141 --> 00:20:30,109
If you agree to a four-year term.

351
00:20:30,176 --> 00:20:33,509
I can get you
a very attractive interest rate.

352
00:20:33,579 --> 00:20:35,979
Four years? That's quite a commitment.

353
00:20:36,249 --> 00:20:37,944
Just think of all the ribs you could eat. Sir.

354
00:20:38,017 --> 00:20:39,075
You don't need to call me "sir. "

355
00:20:39,152 --> 00:20:41,279
I mean. Hell. You know more about me
than my own mother.

356
00:20:41,521 --> 00:20:43,421
<i>- Granger's fine.
- All right.</i>

357
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:48,684
Granger. Be sure to contact us
if you want an upgrade.

358
00:20:48,761 --> 00:20:52,253
And you should be expecting
a new card soon. Thank you.

359
00:20:55,769 --> 00:20:56,997
Granger?

360
00:21:02,242 --> 00:21:03,539
<i>Jennifer David. May I help you?</i>

361
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:05,578
I just wanted to thank you
for the cold remedy.

362
00:21:05,646 --> 00:21:09,776
<i>It really did the trick.
It's me, Granger, by the way.</i>

363
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:14,378
I'm so glad. I was actually going to ask
how you were feeling.

364
00:21:14,455 --> 00:21:17,185
Well. We do what we can do to help. Sir.

365
00:21:21,028 --> 00:21:22,791
<i>Granger, good night.</i>

366
00:21:25,499 --> 00:21:27,194
Be careful. Priya.

367
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:41,774
- No. Papa.
- I'm sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

368
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:55,261
Eh? This is the bathroom.

369
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:56,695
Do you need to use it?

370
00:21:56,765 --> 00:21:58,357
- Have a look.
- No.

371
00:22:00,101 --> 00:22:03,901
This is my bedroom. Our bedroom.

372
00:22:04,973 --> 00:22:08,636
We're buying a brand-new double bed
with a brass headboard.

373
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:12,168
- Mother has already picked it out.
- Yes.

374
00:22:13,348 --> 00:22:15,043
Oh! Uh...

375
00:22:16,151 --> 00:22:20,384
Perhaps one day we'll have our own house
if we both work hard enough.

376
00:22:22,691 --> 00:22:24,886
But we wouldn't have
my mother's fine cooking every day.

377
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:29,155
- She has many things to teach you.
- Yes.

378
00:22:35,504 --> 00:22:38,905
So what sort of things do you like to do?

379
00:22:38,974 --> 00:22:41,841
You know.
If you could live your life any way.

380
00:22:41,911 --> 00:22:43,902
What would you want?

381
00:22:43,979 --> 00:22:48,109
I'm pretty content with things as they are.

382
00:22:48,184 --> 00:22:49,947
Once I'm married...

383
00:22:51,353 --> 00:22:54,720
We're married. I'll have everything.

384
00:22:55,658 --> 00:22:59,150
A wife at home.
A beautifully tended garden.

385
00:23:00,397 --> 00:23:03,594
When you're not busy
with our children. Of course.

386
00:23:05,168 --> 00:23:09,730
I love my job.
And as for children. I'm only 22.

387
00:23:10,974 --> 00:23:15,411
There is time for us to live a little.
Don't you think so?

388
00:23:16,613 --> 00:23:19,275
But we will live a lot right here.

389
00:23:33,396 --> 00:23:38,891
Look at that. That's not sexy?
That's what spots are these days. Sex.

390
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:44,298
I have some vacation time.
So I was thinking.

391
00:23:44,375 --> 00:23:45,706
I'm gonna go with you on your trip.

392
00:23:45,776 --> 00:23:49,940
Oh. And I thought that I...
Well. I thought that I could wear these.

393
00:23:53,718 --> 00:23:55,049
You don't want to go.

394
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:59,920
You know. It's gonna be cold. Foggy.
I'll be in a hotel room all day.

395
00:24:00,024 --> 00:24:03,050
You're gonna need
some in-room entertainment.

396
00:24:03,127 --> 00:24:05,027
I'm on business. Emory.

397
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:09,056
This account is important to us.
I can't be...

398
00:24:11,602 --> 00:24:12,694
Fine.

399
00:24:14,839 --> 00:24:17,330
- Fine.
- Em. I'm sorry.

400
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:22,243
No. You know what? Actually. I think
I'll take Mark Bailey up on his lunch.

401
00:24:23,615 --> 00:24:26,948
I think he has a jet that he takes
to his oceanfront in Bermuda.

402
00:24:27,019 --> 00:24:30,216
- You're trying to tell me something here?
- Yeah.

403
00:24:30,289 --> 00:24:32,519
Nobody says no to Emory Banks.

404
00:24:38,497 --> 00:24:40,055
<i>He has an amazing voice,</i>

405
00:24:40,132 --> 00:24:44,501
<i>he says the most interesting things,
he's funny,</i>

406
00:24:44,569 --> 00:24:46,127
<i>and he has such kind eyes.</i>

407
00:24:46,204 --> 00:24:49,503
- ZIA: You looked up his picture?
- What if we were really soul mates?

408
00:24:49,574 --> 00:24:52,372
Listen. You're just anxious about Vikram.

409
00:24:52,511 --> 00:24:55,878
Trust me. When I was marrying Babu.
I thought my life was gonna end.

410
00:24:55,981 --> 00:24:59,644
I mean. How can two people who
don't even know each other get married?

411
00:24:59,718 --> 00:25:02,084
But then. A few months later.
We were laughing

412
00:25:02,154 --> 00:25:08,025
at something really silly I'd done.
And I realized I'd fallen in love with him.

413
00:25:08,094 --> 00:25:10,289
How sweet.

414
00:25:10,363 --> 00:25:15,027
ZIA: And it's easier than falling in love
with some random voice on the phone.

415
00:25:15,101 --> 00:25:18,696
And seriously. This guy lives in America.

416
00:25:18,771 --> 00:25:21,433
- There's no point.
- I know.

417
00:25:28,915 --> 00:25:29,973
I've got to meet Karen.

418
00:25:30,049 --> 00:25:33,109
Oh. And she made me swear
there'd be no strippers

419
00:25:33,186 --> 00:25:34,949
at the bachelor party.

420
00:25:35,021 --> 00:25:39,720
Well. If Karen said no strippers.
That means no strippers.

421
00:25:39,792 --> 00:25:41,987
Only. I really want strippers.

422
00:25:45,264 --> 00:25:48,632
She didn't say anything
about exotic dancers. Did she?

423
00:25:48,702 --> 00:25:49,964
No. She did not.

424
00:25:55,676 --> 00:25:58,110
Mr. Granger. What can I do for you?

425
00:25:58,178 --> 00:26:01,614
Hey. I just wanted to alert you
a future charge.

426
00:26:01,682 --> 00:26:05,049
When Exotic Minx shows up. That's mine.

427
00:26:05,586 --> 00:26:06,951
I think a pet should make you happy.

428
00:26:08,122 --> 00:26:09,180
Do I seem sad?

429
00:26:09,556 --> 00:26:13,048
Not always. But. You know.
You buy a lot of things.

430
00:26:13,127 --> 00:26:16,028
And people do that
to make themselves happy.

431
00:26:17,064 --> 00:26:19,157
<i>- I eat chocolate.
- Thanks. Doc.</i>

432
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,568
I'm actually hiring dancers
for a bachelor party.

433
00:26:21,635 --> 00:26:22,932
You know. Before the big wedding.

434
00:26:24,438 --> 00:26:25,598
Are you getting married?

435
00:26:25,873 --> 00:26:28,034
Me? No. No. No. No.
It's for my buddy. Charlie.

436
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:31,144
Party's probably gonna cost
a couple grand.

437
00:26:31,212 --> 00:26:35,410
Wow! So what happens
at these bachelor parties?

438
00:26:36,017 --> 00:26:38,110
The usual things you hear about.

439
00:26:38,253 --> 00:26:41,780
But. Really. It's just a symbolic.
Platonic representation

440
00:26:41,856 --> 00:26:44,586
<i>of the last adventure
before one commits to marriage.</i>

441
00:26:45,326 --> 00:26:48,625
I think it's actually a necessary journey.
A rite of passage. If you will.

442
00:26:48,897 --> 00:26:51,730
<i>- I think everyone should have one.
- Me, too.</i>

443
00:26:53,635 --> 00:26:57,127
Hey. Listen. I'm going
to San Francisco next week for work.

444
00:26:57,205 --> 00:27:00,800
And. You know. I thought maybe we could
get together and discuss my options.

445
00:27:03,144 --> 00:27:05,339
Financial things can get so complicated
over the phone.

446
00:27:05,447 --> 00:27:08,280
It's not really company policy
to do these things in person.

447
00:27:08,349 --> 00:27:11,717
<i>Aren't you supposed to keep
the customer satisfied?</i>

448
00:27:13,255 --> 00:27:15,780
Yeah. We love to satisfy.

449
00:27:15,858 --> 00:27:19,521
But I may not be
in San Francisco next week.

450
00:27:19,995 --> 00:27:21,860
I may be in...

451
00:27:24,033 --> 00:27:26,900
I may be out of town
for a relative's birthday.

452
00:27:29,371 --> 00:27:31,839
I have to go back to work now.

453
00:27:32,475 --> 00:27:36,275
Okay. Well. You know.
You have my number if you stay in town.

454
00:27:37,613 --> 00:27:40,514
Wow!
You can really see David Bowie tonight.

455
00:27:41,183 --> 00:27:43,413
<i>- Sorry?
- In the moon. You've never heard that?</i>

456
00:27:43,752 --> 00:27:46,152
You know. When there's a full moon.
You can see David Bowie's face.

457
00:27:47,857 --> 00:27:50,189
Always...
Well. I thought it was Mick Jagger.

458
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:54,121
No. No. No. It's clearly Bowie.
You know. The cheekbones. The chin.

459
00:27:54,197 --> 00:27:56,961
Well. Thank you for using CITYone Bank.

460
00:27:58,702 --> 00:28:00,192
Have a nice day.

461
00:28:01,505 --> 00:28:02,836
Good night.

462
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:17,980
To the guy who said
he's never been anywhere.

463
00:28:18,054 --> 00:28:21,217
I give you. Charlie Hendricks. The world.

464
00:28:21,291 --> 00:28:23,088
Miss Russia.

465
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:26,027
- I'm from Ukraine.
- She's from Ukraine.

466
00:28:27,631 --> 00:28:28,689
Miss Japan.

467
00:28:34,572 --> 00:28:37,871
Miss...
From somewhere where they wear clogs.

468
00:28:38,509 --> 00:28:40,636
No. No. No. No. This guy.

469
00:28:44,182 --> 00:28:47,015
You deserve it. Buddy.
You deserve the world.

470
00:28:47,084 --> 00:28:48,415
Charlie!

471
00:28:48,486 --> 00:28:50,215
Ladies. Come on in.

472
00:29:00,698 --> 00:29:02,029
Thank you.

473
00:29:07,872 --> 00:29:12,138
<i>- Oh. That's too much.
- I'll pay. Baba.</i>

474
00:29:13,544 --> 00:29:14,738
Don't be ridiculous.

475
00:29:14,813 --> 00:29:17,543
Why not let her?
She makes more than you.

476
00:29:27,826 --> 00:29:28,986
Aha!

477
00:29:29,061 --> 00:29:31,427
You will make a beautiful bride.

478
00:29:33,665 --> 00:29:35,292
<i>Thank you. Baba.</i>

479
00:29:36,835 --> 00:29:41,363
<i>We'll take it. Oh. My beta.</i>

480
00:29:46,078 --> 00:29:47,568
- Hello?
- Granger?

481
00:29:48,647 --> 00:29:51,480
- Jennifer!
- Sounds like you're having fun.

482
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:52,915
Oh. It's a full-on rager.

483
00:29:54,253 --> 00:29:56,153
<i>It's Charlie's big night,</i>

484
00:29:56,221 --> 00:29:57,712
and the natives are a bit restless.

485
00:29:57,790 --> 00:30:01,624
Next week. It turns out that I will be able
to meet you before the party.

486
00:30:01,694 --> 00:30:05,721
So we can discuss the upgrade
we were talking about

487
00:30:06,566 --> 00:30:09,194
when we were talking. Before.

488
00:30:09,369 --> 00:30:10,734
<i>That sounds great.</i>

489
00:30:11,237 --> 00:30:12,727
I'd like that.

490
00:30:13,439 --> 00:30:15,873
- It's the credit-card girl.
- Nice.

491
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:18,305
I'll be in San Francisco on Thursday.

492
00:30:18,378 --> 00:30:21,745
So maybe we can meet
at the Hawksin Grand Hotel?

493
00:30:22,548 --> 00:30:23,708
<i>- You know where that is?
- Word.</i>

494
00:30:23,783 --> 00:30:25,648
Okay. Let's say 6:00.

495
00:30:25,718 --> 00:30:28,448
I'll be the dashing New Yorker
with unlimited credit.

496
00:30:28,521 --> 00:30:30,455
It's a date.

497
00:30:30,523 --> 00:30:35,722
I mean. Thursday is the date of the day
when we'll meet.

498
00:30:35,795 --> 00:30:37,126
<i>I'll see you then.</i>

499
00:30:47,041 --> 00:30:49,236
ZIA: You know you're crazy. Right?

500
00:30:49,443 --> 00:30:50,705
Hmm.

501
00:30:50,778 --> 00:30:54,043
What if this guy turns out to be
from a bad family and kidnaps you

502
00:30:54,114 --> 00:30:58,210
and makes you clean their toilets
and. Like. Clean their dirty cats and all?

503
00:30:58,285 --> 00:31:01,550
Then he's in real trouble.
I'm not a good cleaner.

504
00:31:01,622 --> 00:31:03,954
<i>Bhaiya, Mumbai Airport.
Thank you. bhaiya.</i>

505
00:31:22,344 --> 00:31:23,868
<i>ZIA: Thanks. bhaiya.</i>

506
00:31:30,685 --> 00:31:32,380
You know you're playing with matches.

507
00:31:32,454 --> 00:31:34,945
Fire? Why can't I have a little of that?

508
00:31:35,023 --> 00:31:38,686
Why can't I have
just one amazing last adventure

509
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:41,228
before I come back to Vikram?
This is my bachelor party.

510
00:31:41,296 --> 00:31:43,059
I can't believe you're going all this way

511
00:31:43,131 --> 00:31:47,192
to see if this deranged guy is your Tom.
Richard. Harry. Hank soul mate guy.

512
00:31:47,268 --> 00:31:50,169
- I don't know.
- I promise you. I'll be back in two pieces.

513
00:31:50,238 --> 00:31:53,332
- You better.
- Wish the stars to shine bright on me.

514
00:31:57,612 --> 00:32:00,911
<i>Mummy, Papa, please don't faint,</i>

515
00:32:00,982 --> 00:32:05,079
<i>but by the time you hear this,
I'll be on my way to America.</i>

516
00:32:05,154 --> 00:32:08,817
<i>I know I should have told you,
but it was a last-minute decision.</i>

517
00:32:08,958 --> 00:32:14,260
<i>I left my heart</i>

518
00:32:17,433 --> 00:32:20,300
<i>In San Francisco</i>

519
00:32:26,642 --> 00:32:30,305
<i>I've decided to attend
father's cousin sister's birthday party</i>

520
00:32:30,379 --> 00:32:34,941
<i>in Palo Alto.
It's been a long time since I've seen them.</i>

521
00:32:35,017 --> 00:32:39,750
<i>I'll send everyone your regards.
And see you in five days, maybe.</i>

522
00:32:40,756 --> 00:32:42,018
Ouch!

523
00:32:42,959 --> 00:32:46,122
<i>And please don't panic,
I'm using my own savings.</i>

524
00:32:47,197 --> 00:32:51,463
<i>Papa, remember how you always wanted
your little daughter to travel</i>

525
00:32:51,535 --> 00:32:54,561
<i>and learn different cultures?</i>

526
00:32:54,638 --> 00:32:56,071
<i>This is your gift to me.</i>

527
00:32:56,406 --> 00:33:00,866
<i>The morning fog</i>

528
00:33:00,944 --> 00:33:05,381
<i>May chill the air</i>

529
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:09,741
Hello. Welcome to Hawksin Hotel.

530
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:11,549
- Have you got your passport on you?
- Yeah.

531
00:33:11,621 --> 00:33:14,681
Great. Thank you.

532
00:33:14,758 --> 00:33:17,056
You're the behind-the-scenes creative guy.

533
00:33:17,127 --> 00:33:21,325
Yes. Yes. No. And he knows why.

534
00:33:21,398 --> 00:33:23,093
Mr. Hawksin.

535
00:33:23,166 --> 00:33:25,431
Well. Well.
Look who decided to get off their butts

536
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:26,663
and come fight for the job.

537
00:33:26,737 --> 00:33:28,068
Never turn down a second chance.

538
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:31,233
The rooms are fantastic. By the way.
Thank you. Sir.

539
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:34,005
- May I speak. Sir?
- Only to say thank you.

540
00:33:34,078 --> 00:33:36,546
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

541
00:33:36,614 --> 00:33:39,640
- We're gonna knock your socks off.
- And then he ruins it by speaking again.

542
00:33:39,717 --> 00:33:42,413
Didn't we talk about that?
Didn't I ask you not to speak so much?

543
00:33:42,487 --> 00:33:45,047
Didn't I tell you to learn to listen?
Don't you want to be a nice boy?

544
00:33:45,122 --> 00:33:49,855
Didn't I tell you to be more like him?
Here. Watch this. Your hair is on fire.

545
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:55,590
But I don't want a Honda. Learn from this.

546
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,066
Could you shut up? He doesn't like you.

547
00:34:03,241 --> 00:34:04,606
He likes me.

548
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:15,211
I can't believe you're hooking up
with the credit-card girl.

549
00:34:16,255 --> 00:34:20,487
No. Wait. I believe it. You're gutsy. Pal.

550
00:34:20,826 --> 00:34:25,729
I mean. What if she turns out
to be this lonely housewife

551
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:29,928
with four kids and bad teeth and gout?

552
00:34:30,002 --> 00:34:31,367
It's just drinks.

553
00:34:47,486 --> 00:34:48,954
Vibe?
- I got a good vibe.

554
00:34:49,022 --> 00:34:50,114
Oh!

555
00:34:50,957 --> 00:34:53,016
Just your type. 1 o'clock behind you.

556
00:34:53,092 --> 00:34:54,753
- This one?
- Yeah.

557
00:34:57,263 --> 00:34:58,628
Seriously.

558
00:35:01,968 --> 00:35:03,230
That's her.

559
00:35:04,771 --> 00:35:07,467
- I'm going in.
- Good luck.

560
00:35:21,354 --> 00:35:24,016
- Excuse me. Granger Woodruff.
Hi.

561
00:35:24,924 --> 00:35:29,225
- You're not Jennifer David?
- No. But I wish I was.

562
00:35:31,265 --> 00:35:33,529
Sorry. I thought you were somebody else.

563
00:35:38,372 --> 00:35:41,535
Excuse me. Ladies...

564
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:46,043
You're not Jennifer David?

565
00:35:46,113 --> 00:35:48,809
<i>- You didn't even talk to him?
I couldn't, Zia.</i>

566
00:35:49,049 --> 00:35:52,541
I was frozen. Stuck. Like gum.

567
00:35:52,653 --> 00:35:54,211
Okay. So your crazy crush is over.

568
00:35:54,288 --> 00:35:57,280
<i>Just come home. We'll watch
Fatal Attraction and you'll be fine.</i>

569
00:35:57,358 --> 00:35:58,518
Listen. This guy was no good.

570
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:01,425
I'm sure he lied about those charges
and he spends money like a maniac.

571
00:36:01,495 --> 00:36:02,757
He's not a liar.

572
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:06,027
And then he just. Like. Covers it all up.
It's just much better that you run now

573
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,091
Than be hot-glued to the floor later.

574
00:36:08,168 --> 00:36:09,829
Maybe I expected too much.

575
00:36:09,903 --> 00:36:12,429
<i>Besides, he didn't even
get a chance to meet me.</i>

576
00:36:12,507 --> 00:36:14,771
<i>If he did...</i>

577
00:36:14,843 --> 00:36:17,641
You know. There was something
magical in our talk. Zia.

578
00:36:17,712 --> 00:36:19,703
<i>- I promise you.
- Yes.</i>

579
00:36:19,781 --> 00:36:23,649
I do think that the American slang
for that is "bullshit. "

580
00:36:24,252 --> 00:36:26,379
<i>- Just come home, okay?
- Bye.</i>

581
00:36:32,994 --> 00:36:35,121
So. Your girl stood you up.

582
00:36:35,363 --> 00:36:38,093
Come out to dinner with me and Karen's
best friend. It'll be good for a laugh.

583
00:36:38,166 --> 00:36:40,726
Discussing the intimate details
of bridesmaids' dresses

584
00:36:40,802 --> 00:36:42,360
isn't my idea of a good time.

585
00:36:42,437 --> 00:36:46,737
But you. My friend. You've got to take
this stuff seriously. It's your wedding.

586
00:36:48,443 --> 00:36:50,843
Let me know how the bouquets work out.

587
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:57,319
Sorry. You okay?

588
00:36:59,522 --> 00:37:03,151
- Gray...
- No. No. No. No. You... Do you see color?

589
00:37:03,626 --> 00:37:08,359
Look. Red bag. Red...

590
00:37:13,869 --> 00:37:18,169
Keep the legs elevated.
I think you're gonna live.

591
00:37:18,974 --> 00:37:21,306
- I'm all right.
- I'm really sorry.

592
00:37:21,711 --> 00:37:24,771
- I didn't see you.
- No. I... I wasn't looking. I was...

593
00:37:24,847 --> 00:37:28,112
No. No. No. It's my fault. I feel awful.

594
00:37:29,719 --> 00:37:31,619
I wish you wouldn't...

595
00:37:32,855 --> 00:37:36,519
- Oh. I'm sorry.
- No. I mean...

596
00:37:37,227 --> 00:37:39,559
I wish you wouldn't feel awful.

597
00:37:42,866 --> 00:37:46,393
So. Are you here on vacation?

598
00:37:48,071 --> 00:37:54,909
Yeah. From India. I'm visiting a relative
at Palo Alto. Just for a party.

599
00:37:56,313 --> 00:37:58,679
Hey. I know this might sound odd.

600
00:37:58,749 --> 00:38:01,684
And considering the dangers
of being with me and all.

601
00:38:01,752 --> 00:38:03,913
But you hungry?

602
00:38:04,621 --> 00:38:08,682
I was gonna go out to dinner.
And I thought you might want to come.

603
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:11,391
Oh! Um...

604
00:38:14,931 --> 00:38:20,268
That'll be nice. But only if it's ribs.

605
00:38:20,671 --> 00:38:25,438
I read about this place in my guidebook.
You do like meat. Don't you?

606
00:38:27,745 --> 00:38:28,734
Yeah.

607
00:38:30,648 --> 00:38:32,047
Mmm.

608
00:38:32,383 --> 00:38:35,443
They're delicious. Thank you.

609
00:38:35,953 --> 00:38:38,751
Granger Woodruff. By the way.

610
00:38:40,191 --> 00:38:42,318
Hello. Granger. I'm Priya Sethi.

611
00:38:43,194 --> 00:38:45,924
Okay. Priya. You've got to just dig in.

612
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:48,264
Okay? Don't...
Don't worry about getting messy.

613
00:38:48,332 --> 00:38:50,766
Just get it all over you.

614
00:38:50,835 --> 00:38:52,063
Okay.

615
00:38:53,838 --> 00:38:56,170
So. What do you do in Mumbai?

616
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:01,406
- I'm a nurse. Yeah.
- Nurse.

617
00:39:01,814 --> 00:39:03,577
It's quite nice.

618
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:06,945
- Good food.
- So...

619
00:39:07,753 --> 00:39:10,449
- Is this your first trip to America?
- Yeah.

620
00:39:10,522 --> 00:39:14,822
I always wanted to come.
And it's much more than I've expected.

621
00:39:16,094 --> 00:39:18,722
- You're on vacation?
- I wish.

622
00:39:19,765 --> 00:39:24,134
I'm actually here for a business campaign.
I have this huge presentation next week.

623
00:39:24,303 --> 00:39:28,399
Hey. Maybe you can help me.
I mean. You're international clientele.

624
00:39:29,308 --> 00:39:31,708
What attracted you to the Hawksin Hotel?

625
00:39:34,446 --> 00:39:38,109
- A friend told me about it.
- So you go on personal recommendations?

626
00:39:38,317 --> 00:39:41,378
I mean. Do you ever just
want to take a chance?

627
00:39:41,888 --> 00:39:45,790
You know. Like... Like the feeling
of trying something different?

628
00:39:45,859 --> 00:39:50,159
I take chances. But usually
I can never afford them.

629
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:54,098
Charge it. You know. Charge everything.
Just pay for it later.

630
00:39:55,068 --> 00:39:57,696
Just don't let it get stolen.

631
00:39:58,471 --> 00:40:00,462
Did someone steal your card?

632
00:40:00,573 --> 00:40:03,474
I have my ace credit-card girl
working on it.

633
00:40:03,543 --> 00:40:07,502
She was actually supposed to meet me.
But she blew me off.

634
00:40:07,881 --> 00:40:11,715
Yeah. When someone opts out
of a prearranged appointment.

635
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:17,484
- For what purpose were you to meet her?
- Just casual.

636
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:19,421
She sounded nice.

637
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:23,088
But her friends probably warned her
about meeting a complete stranger.

638
00:40:23,163 --> 00:40:25,324
And she probably thought I was psychotic.

639
00:40:25,399 --> 00:40:28,425
Or maybe she just took
one look at me and ran.

640
00:40:31,305 --> 00:40:34,172
Excuse me. I...
I need to go to the restroom.

641
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:40,970
Zia. It's me. Could you please connect me
to Granger? It's 4593330555.

642
00:40:41,048 --> 00:40:44,279
Why do you want to talk to him?
I thought you blew him out.

643
00:40:44,351 --> 00:40:49,220
I don't want him to think I was rude. And
actually. We're having dinner right now.

644
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:53,817
<i>- What? You told him you're Jennifer?
- No. It... It doesn't matter.</i>

645
00:40:53,994 --> 00:40:56,258
<i>We're meeting as our real selves,
and it's better this way.</i>

646
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:58,696
<i>So, could you please
connect me to Granger?</i>

647
00:40:58,766 --> 00:41:00,495
Priya. This can lead to no good.

648
00:41:00,567 --> 00:41:05,505
Or it could lead to the perfect romantic
moment under the Golden Gate Bridge.

649
00:41:06,074 --> 00:41:08,599
Listen. Honestly. You've lost your head.

650
00:41:11,713 --> 00:41:12,873
Hello?

651
00:41:12,948 --> 00:41:15,041
Hello. Granger. It's Jennifer David.

652
00:41:15,116 --> 00:41:17,846
Hey! Is everything okay?

653
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:21,353
I'm afraid when you didn't show up.
I signed up with the Visa girl.

654
00:41:21,423 --> 00:41:23,152
<i>She threw in a hat.</i>

655
00:41:23,892 --> 00:41:26,861
I wanted to apologize
about not making our appointment.

656
00:41:26,928 --> 00:41:29,863
It turns out I'm out of town. After all.

657
00:41:29,931 --> 00:41:32,593
That's cool. Maybe next time. Then.

658
00:41:33,068 --> 00:41:36,595
Very good. It...
It sounds like you're at a restaurant.

659
00:41:36,671 --> 00:41:41,108
<i>- Teddy's Barbecue. You been?
- Yeah. I was there recently.</i>

660
00:41:41,176 --> 00:41:45,443
Excellent ribs. It's very romantic. Isn't it?

661
00:41:47,516 --> 00:41:53,011
Yeah. You know. Since you stood me up.
I'm actually here with a nice girl.

662
00:41:53,656 --> 00:41:55,715
Of course. I did smack her in the head.

663
00:41:55,791 --> 00:41:58,089
Which I wouldn't have done
if you did show up.

664
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:01,596
Well. Have fun with your friend.
I'm sure she's quite lovely.

665
00:42:02,231 --> 00:42:08,397
Inside and out. Not to be conceited for her.
Enjoy your evening.

666
00:42:08,804 --> 00:42:11,864
- Good night.
- Good night.

667
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:29,681
Oh. Wow. She's so good.

668
00:42:32,863 --> 00:42:37,493
- Hello?
- Hello. Sister. How're things there?

669
00:42:38,268 --> 00:42:40,361
<i>- Ji, ask.
- Okay.</i>

670
00:42:40,937 --> 00:42:42,199
What I wanted to know. Sister...

671
00:42:42,272 --> 00:42:44,263
Anji. Just switch it off. I can't hear a word.

672
00:42:45,542 --> 00:42:47,840
Has finally Priya arrived there?

673
00:42:48,512 --> 00:42:51,413
Priya? No. Priya isn't here.

674
00:42:51,681 --> 00:42:52,875
Priya is not there?

675
00:42:54,184 --> 00:42:57,711
One minute. One minute. Supposing...
Supposing she wants to give a surprise?

676
00:42:57,788 --> 00:43:00,348
- Hang up. Hang up.
- Wait a minute. Sister. What?

677
00:43:00,424 --> 00:43:02,358
- Hang up the phone.
- She might want to give a surprise.

678
00:43:02,426 --> 00:43:04,018
- Hang up. Hang up.
- I just can't hang up just like that.

679
00:43:04,094 --> 00:43:05,083
- Quiet!
- Hang up.

680
00:43:06,229 --> 00:43:07,595
<i>Haan, sister. In case Priya...</i>

681
00:43:08,733 --> 00:43:10,428
In case Priya calls up.

682
00:43:10,501 --> 00:43:12,696
Just tell her that... Just inform us. Okay?

683
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:16,365
<i>Stop it. ji, stop it.
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hello. Phone...</i>

684
00:43:16,441 --> 00:43:18,500
He sounded very confused.

685
00:43:27,985 --> 00:43:31,284
- Woodruff. Well...
- Mr. Hawksin.

686
00:43:33,524 --> 00:43:35,754
I'd like you to meet my wife. Haejin.

687
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:37,618
- Hello.
- Hi. Granger.

688
00:43:38,062 --> 00:43:43,022
I'd like to introduce you to a very good
friend of mine. Priya Sethi.

689
00:43:43,401 --> 00:43:44,425
She's from Mumbai.

690
00:43:44,502 --> 00:43:46,766
Mumbai.
That's the New York of India. Right?

691
00:43:46,838 --> 00:43:49,000
I hear there's quite an explosion
of jobs there.

692
00:43:49,074 --> 00:43:52,373
I like to think of New York
as the Mumbai of America.

693
00:43:52,444 --> 00:43:54,412
Both with talented human resources.

694
00:43:58,650 --> 00:44:01,949
- That's so sweet.
Very impressive.

695
00:44:02,321 --> 00:44:04,687
Well. We opened a hotel in Mumbai in '98.

696
00:44:04,756 --> 00:44:07,224
The Hawksin Standard at Nariman Point.
Do you know it?

697
00:44:07,292 --> 00:44:11,058
It's beautiful.
The use of steel and glass is breathtaking.

698
00:44:11,163 --> 00:44:14,690
Thank you. We think so. Too.
You're lovely. Isn't she?

699
00:44:15,067 --> 00:44:17,558
- She's lovely.
- Yes. She is.

700
00:44:17,870 --> 00:44:21,067
Has he invited you to our little shindig?

701
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:24,371
- I was just about to. Actually.
- Good. Good. Hold on a second.

702
00:44:24,443 --> 00:44:27,276
Mary Pat. This young lady has come
a very long way to be with us.

703
00:44:27,346 --> 00:44:30,214
Would you give her our nicest room.
With fruit basket. Extra chocolates.

704
00:44:30,283 --> 00:44:31,807
Flowers every day? On my account.

705
00:44:31,885 --> 00:44:34,410
Very good. Mr. Hawksin.
- That's very generous. Sir.

706
00:44:34,487 --> 00:44:35,886
Don't be silly.

707
00:44:36,055 --> 00:44:40,856
So. We'll move you to 1740. It's a nicer
floor with its own concierge service.

708
00:44:40,927 --> 00:44:44,658
And I'll put you under Mr. Hawksin's name
as his guest.

709
00:44:44,731 --> 00:44:46,790
Thank you. That's very kind of you.

710
00:44:46,866 --> 00:44:50,233
Not at all. One of the pleasures
of owning places like this.

711
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:52,828
Doing nice things for nice people.

712
00:44:55,742 --> 00:44:57,767
If you'll excuse us.
We'll say our good nights.

713
00:44:57,844 --> 00:44:59,106
Good night.

714
00:44:59,279 --> 00:45:01,247
- Good night.
- Good night.

715
00:45:06,819 --> 00:45:09,253
Wow! I... You...

716
00:45:09,622 --> 00:45:13,423
You know. He really...
I've never seen him act like that before.

717
00:45:13,494 --> 00:45:16,463
- Yeah?
- That was amazing.

718
00:45:16,697 --> 00:45:18,358
No. No.
Let me just get one thing right.

719
00:45:18,432 --> 00:45:20,423
Aren't you supposed to be
Priya's best friend?

720
00:45:20,501 --> 00:45:21,763
Yes. Mr. Sethi.

721
00:45:21,835 --> 00:45:23,996
- Isn't she supposed to tell you everything?
- Yes.

722
00:45:24,071 --> 00:45:25,504
Then why aren't you telling me
where she is?

723
00:45:25,573 --> 00:45:27,336
Okay. Maybe I should ask Miss Prasad.
Miss Prasad!

724
00:45:27,408 --> 00:45:29,308
No. No. No. Mr. Sethi. Please.

725
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:31,338
- I'll tell you.
- What?

726
00:45:31,412 --> 00:45:34,245
- She's gone to meet a CITYone customer.
- Okay. Where?

727
00:45:34,315 --> 00:45:37,682
- Mr. Granger Woodruff.
- Okay. An American?

728
00:45:38,619 --> 00:45:40,587
- To America? Oh. My God!
- Oh. God. No...

729
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:42,349
- I should have never let her work here.
- No.

730
00:45:42,423 --> 00:45:46,018
No. No. No! Mr. Sethi.
I promise you. She's coming back.

731
00:45:46,093 --> 00:45:49,028
She had no intention to elope.
Or anything of that nature.

732
00:45:49,096 --> 00:45:51,997
- Elope? Who is talking about elope?
- Oh. God.

733
00:45:52,066 --> 00:45:54,160
Oh. My God. I have to go.
I have to go and get her.

734
00:45:54,236 --> 00:45:56,796
- I have...
- No. No. No. Mr. Sethi! No. No!

735
00:45:56,871 --> 00:45:59,066
Mr. Sethi. I promise you.
She's coming back.

736
00:46:25,634 --> 00:46:27,864
Morning. Priya.

737
00:46:28,303 --> 00:46:31,932
Hey! Isn't it amazing?

738
00:46:33,441 --> 00:46:36,900
- I love rain.
- Yeah. Yeah. It's... It's great.

739
00:46:37,913 --> 00:46:40,575
Hey. You're still going to meet me at
the restaurant tonight at 7:00. right?

740
00:46:40,650 --> 00:46:45,587
Yeah.
Hey. Is this a fancy party or something?

741
00:46:46,222 --> 00:46:48,417
Well. You might want to wear
something nice.

742
00:46:48,491 --> 00:46:51,983
I mean. Not nice-nice. But. You know.

743
00:46:52,528 --> 00:46:53,756
Yeah.

744
00:46:57,133 --> 00:47:01,570
Well. I have some work to do.
But I'll see you tonight.

745
00:47:02,371 --> 00:47:03,565
Great.

746
00:47:10,546 --> 00:47:13,014
<i>Welcome to San Francisco International.</i>

747
00:47:13,115 --> 00:47:14,673
Now. The moment we find our luggage.

748
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:17,515
- We'll go and find this Hawksin hotel.
- Careful. Careful.

749
00:47:19,556 --> 00:47:22,616
- Rajiv Uncle!
- Who's this man talking to me like this?

750
00:47:22,793 --> 00:47:25,626
- I'm Sajarit from Punjab.
- Okay. How...

751
00:47:25,696 --> 00:47:28,563
I know it has been a little while
since Navinda's wedding. But...

752
00:47:28,632 --> 00:47:31,260
Your family owns that store in Hoboken.

753
00:47:31,335 --> 00:47:32,495
- Oh. Yeah.
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

754
00:47:32,569 --> 00:47:34,901
<i>- And she's my wife. Neha.
- Hello. namaste.</i>

755
00:47:34,971 --> 00:47:37,132
And you are here
for Rani Auntie's birthday.

756
00:47:37,207 --> 00:47:39,232
Of course. Of course.
And we are getting late

757
00:47:39,309 --> 00:47:41,300
and we have to find a cab
and get our luggage first.

758
00:47:41,378 --> 00:47:42,902
Come. Come. Come.
I'll give you a ride in my car.

759
00:47:42,979 --> 00:47:44,879
No. No. No! We don't want a ride!

760
00:47:44,948 --> 00:47:46,939
My parents will be furious
if I did not give a ride.

761
00:47:47,017 --> 00:47:49,884
- Please. Come with me. My car is quite big.
- No. No. No... It's fine. Thank you.

762
00:47:49,953 --> 00:47:51,443
My car is fast. Neha. Please hold this.

763
00:47:51,521 --> 00:47:52,818
- Okay.
- Come. Come. Come. Come. Come.

764
00:47:52,889 --> 00:47:54,982
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I'll help you.
- It's fine! It's fine...

765
00:47:55,058 --> 00:47:57,720
It's so good to see you.
Come. Please. Excuse me.

766
00:47:57,794 --> 00:48:01,492
And this is a most pleasant surprise for us.
Please accept tea.

767
00:48:01,566 --> 00:48:03,864
We thought. Since you were coming
all the way from here

768
00:48:03,935 --> 00:48:07,029
to Mumbai for Priya's wedding.

769
00:48:07,105 --> 00:48:11,701
We thought it was important that we also
show our respects. By coming to...

770
00:48:11,776 --> 00:48:16,304
<i>Han ji. You know. But we are only sorry
that Priya and Govinda couldn't come.</i>

771
00:48:16,414 --> 00:48:20,111
- Priya is visiting friends.
- Friends.

772
00:48:21,085 --> 00:48:25,385
And Govinda. You know. So
busy with exams and cricket and all that.

773
00:48:25,456 --> 00:48:27,424
<i>- His final exam's going on.
- Han ji. Han ji.</i>

774
00:48:47,446 --> 00:48:50,882
Hi. Sorry to disturb you.
Delivery for Priya Sethi.

775
00:48:50,949 --> 00:48:53,941
- Really? Thank you.
- Here you go.

776
00:49:06,732 --> 00:49:09,098
Anji. Where is your boom box?

777
00:49:10,169 --> 00:49:12,137
- She's asleep.
- Okay.

778
00:49:13,672 --> 00:49:18,769
All right. We will find this Hotel Hawkskin
as quickly as possible.

779
00:49:18,844 --> 00:49:21,643
- Yeah.
- There. We will divide.

780
00:49:22,048 --> 00:49:24,141
locate Priya and take her home.

781
00:49:24,684 --> 00:49:27,551
Pimmi. You will stay here.
If there's a problem. We'll call you.

782
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:30,316
<i>- No. No. No. No. I'm coming with you.
- Let her come. ji.</i>

783
00:49:30,390 --> 00:49:32,255
- Okay. Huh?
Rajiv? Where is he?

784
00:49:32,325 --> 00:49:34,225
- Hello.
- Hello.

785
00:49:34,294 --> 00:49:37,127
Oh. There you are.
Rajiv. Please come down.

786
00:49:37,230 --> 00:49:41,257
Anji wants to show her dance. She's been
practicing specially for Rani Auntie.

787
00:49:41,334 --> 00:49:45,100
<i>But. Auntieji's sleeping.
I don't think it's nice to disturb her.</i>

788
00:49:45,171 --> 00:49:49,039
Let her sleep. She sleeps through
everything. You. Come down. Come.

789
00:49:49,108 --> 00:49:51,406
- Now?
- Oh. Yeah. Why not?

790
00:49:52,078 --> 00:49:53,841
- Right now?
- Oh. Yeah. Right now.

791
00:49:53,913 --> 00:49:57,508
Come on. She's all set with her music
in her hand. Please. Rajiv.

792
00:49:59,152 --> 00:50:01,052
Come on. Anji. Play some music. Come on.

793
00:50:03,524 --> 00:50:05,185
Shake it. Anji!

794
00:50:06,594 --> 00:50:08,892
Isn't she wonderful. Rajiv?

795
00:50:11,665 --> 00:50:13,257
Come on. Do it!

796
00:50:15,269 --> 00:50:18,830
Oh. I forgot. The Sawants are coming over
for dinner tonight.

797
00:50:39,059 --> 00:50:42,654
<i>Some day</i>

798
00:50:43,330 --> 00:50:46,994
<i>When I'm awfully low</i>

799
00:50:47,802 --> 00:50:51,738
<i>When the world is cold</i>

800
00:50:52,407 --> 00:50:55,069
<i>I will feel a glow</i>

801
00:50:55,143 --> 00:51:00,410
<i>Just thinking of you</i>

802
00:51:01,283 --> 00:51:07,882
<i>And the way you look tonight</i>

803
00:51:16,264 --> 00:51:17,697
<i>Lovely</i>

804
00:51:17,799 --> 00:51:19,198
Who's that?

805
00:51:20,802 --> 00:51:22,326
Just a friend.

806
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:25,199
First impressions can be deceiving.

807
00:51:25,273 --> 00:51:27,572
- The thing about this guy...
- Here we go.

808
00:51:27,643 --> 00:51:31,010
...he's all casual charm
like nothing gets to him.

809
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:33,446
But really. Complete softie.

810
00:51:33,516 --> 00:51:35,074
- Yeah?
- In college.

811
00:51:35,151 --> 00:51:39,349
He couldn't eat or sleep
until this girl he liked finally talked to him.

812
00:51:39,422 --> 00:51:41,982
- I think he actually threw up afterwards.
- What?

813
00:51:42,058 --> 00:51:43,855
The man knows
how to make an impression.

814
00:51:43,926 --> 00:51:45,894
Wait. Let me give you a little advice.

815
00:51:45,962 --> 00:51:47,554
Don't listen to drunk Americans.

816
00:51:47,630 --> 00:51:49,598
No. But I do agree with Charlie.

817
00:51:49,665 --> 00:51:52,657
You know. There's something more
than what you really show.

818
00:51:52,735 --> 00:51:54,896
What about you? Any secrets?

819
00:51:54,971 --> 00:51:58,805
Are you an Indian movie star
hiding in America as a tourist?

820
00:51:59,709 --> 00:52:02,234
Well. Glad you could make it.
Enjoying yourselves. I hope?

821
00:52:02,311 --> 00:52:04,142
- Definitely. Thank you. Sir.
Thank you.

822
00:52:05,014 --> 00:52:06,504
It's a wonderful party.

823
00:52:06,582 --> 00:52:08,949
Same feeling as the rest of your hotels.

824
00:52:09,019 --> 00:52:11,886
A magical oasis
that springs from nowhere.

825
00:52:11,955 --> 00:52:14,048
It's so familiar.

826
00:52:14,124 --> 00:52:15,523
We need you now.

827
00:52:15,592 --> 00:52:17,184
Maybe I should hire her
for my ad campaign.

828
00:52:18,629 --> 00:52:20,096
She's a smart girl.

829
00:52:21,632 --> 00:52:23,827
- He's kidding. Right?
- Yeah. He's kidding.

830
00:52:25,435 --> 00:52:27,062
Have fun. Buddy.

831
00:52:28,238 --> 00:52:29,227
It's okay.

832
00:52:31,108 --> 00:52:34,077
Look. But don't touch.
Look. But don't touch.

833
00:52:34,478 --> 00:52:36,446
Do you know. When I was little.

834
00:52:36,513 --> 00:52:40,313
I always wanted to find the golden ticket
in that chocolate.

835
00:52:40,384 --> 00:52:42,648
Like Willy Wonka.

836
00:52:44,254 --> 00:52:46,882
So that I could go somewhere new.

837
00:52:48,091 --> 00:52:50,219
I always wanted to know
who was gonna drink that chocolate

838
00:52:50,294 --> 00:52:52,854
- after the fat kid fell in it.
- Yeah.

839
00:52:54,666 --> 00:52:57,157
Did you just try to push me in?

840
00:52:57,235 --> 00:52:59,328
That was a tap and you're too heavy.

841
00:52:59,404 --> 00:53:01,634
You see.
I knew there was another side to you.

842
00:53:01,706 --> 00:53:05,574
On the outside. You're the psychic.
Sweet nurse from India.

843
00:53:06,744 --> 00:53:08,541
But you've got a streak.

844
00:53:12,016 --> 00:53:15,281
You're right.
There are things you should know.

845
00:53:19,924 --> 00:53:21,789
- Talk. Talk.
- Are you mad?

846
00:53:21,859 --> 00:53:23,690
- No.
- Talk.

847
00:53:23,761 --> 00:53:25,422
I'll throw you in.

848
00:53:27,265 --> 00:53:29,563
I forgot to watch out for drunk Americans.

849
00:53:31,804 --> 00:53:32,896
Oh. There you are.

850
00:53:32,971 --> 00:53:34,802
Listen. I know. I know.
I'm sorry to interrupt.

851
00:53:34,873 --> 00:53:36,670
Business first. I need you for a second.

852
00:53:36,742 --> 00:53:38,471
One of us will be right back.

853
00:53:46,485 --> 00:53:48,510
- Gee.
- What's up. Buddy?

854
00:53:49,421 --> 00:53:52,913
- I just put something together.
- Oh. Yeah? What's that?

855
00:53:53,692 --> 00:53:55,751
Well. Call me cynical.

856
00:53:56,562 --> 00:53:59,326
But did you bring your Indian friend
Prius here...

857
00:53:59,398 --> 00:54:01,263
- Priya.
Whatever.

858
00:54:01,333 --> 00:54:05,235
To show Hawksin you're some
free-thinking. International guy?

859
00:54:05,304 --> 00:54:07,795
"Look at me. I'm dating an Indian girl. "

860
00:54:07,873 --> 00:54:10,467
Yeah. You...
You figured me out. Chuck.

861
00:54:10,542 --> 00:54:12,442
Oh. Yeah.

862
00:54:14,948 --> 00:54:16,540
All right. All right.

863
00:54:21,755 --> 00:54:23,848
Priya! Priya. Wait!

864
00:54:27,727 --> 00:54:30,025
- Where are you going?
- I'm going back.

865
00:54:31,297 --> 00:54:32,958
I think I've served my purpose.

866
00:54:34,067 --> 00:54:37,434
- What are you talking about?
- I hope I was impressive enough for him.

867
00:54:38,471 --> 00:54:39,460
I heard you.

868
00:54:39,539 --> 00:54:42,975
You only took me to the party
to make your boss happy.

869
00:54:43,543 --> 00:54:45,534
Is that why you bought me this dress?

870
00:54:46,346 --> 00:54:49,179
- So I wouldn't embarrass you?
- What?

871
00:54:49,249 --> 00:54:50,910
No. No.

872
00:54:55,489 --> 00:54:58,253
Okay. look. The thought did cross my mind

873
00:54:58,325 --> 00:55:00,816
that bringing you to this party
would impress Kit.

874
00:55:00,895 --> 00:55:03,864
- But the truth is. I think you're...
- Stupid.

875
00:55:05,032 --> 00:55:06,226
Right?

876
00:55:21,849 --> 00:55:24,317
Get into the car.
Both of you. Get into the car.

877
00:55:24,385 --> 00:55:27,013
Rajiv! Rajiv. Where are you off to?

878
00:55:27,121 --> 00:55:29,817
Priya called and asked us
to pick her up from the city.

879
00:55:29,890 --> 00:55:32,051
We didn't want to inconvenience you. So...

880
00:55:32,126 --> 00:55:34,458
I'll also come with you. Since you don't
know your way around here.

881
00:55:34,528 --> 00:55:36,963
No. No. We've got the map.
Show her the map.

882
00:55:37,032 --> 00:55:40,661
You've been already too generous. Okay?
We'll return the car soon. Bye!

883
00:55:40,735 --> 00:55:41,759
- Bye!
- Bye!

884
00:55:56,484 --> 00:55:57,815
Who is it?

885
00:56:15,370 --> 00:56:17,737
I don't have time
to eat your poisoned candy.

886
00:56:17,807 --> 00:56:19,240
It's just a little poison.

887
00:56:20,076 --> 00:56:22,101
Come on! Just one bite.

888
00:56:23,379 --> 00:56:24,971
Did you read it?

889
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:27,273
No. I threw it away.

890
00:56:30,353 --> 00:56:32,617
I heard your little fingers
peel back the wrapper.

891
00:56:32,688 --> 00:56:36,954
Though. As I've witnessed.
Your ears are far superior to mine.

892
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:48,101
It's American for "I'm sorry. "

893
00:56:48,170 --> 00:56:50,195
Did you steal it from the hotel lobby?

894
00:56:50,273 --> 00:56:52,104
That is an outrageous accusation.

895
00:56:52,942 --> 00:56:54,876
Okay. Yeah. I did.

896
00:57:04,888 --> 00:57:08,551
Okay. Everything except the last thing.

897
00:57:12,496 --> 00:57:14,794
You're right. I'm sorry.

898
00:57:20,604 --> 00:57:23,903
At least let me give you a day
you'll never forget?

899
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:34,515
All right. I promised you a day
you're never gonna forget.

900
00:57:34,584 --> 00:57:36,745
- And that's what you're gonna get.
- And your presentation?

901
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:38,014
I'm procrastinating.

902
00:57:38,088 --> 00:57:41,081
Actually. I was hoping
you'd be my inspiration.

903
00:57:41,159 --> 00:57:42,456
Wow!

904
00:57:42,527 --> 00:57:44,620
Now. Anything catches your eye.
Just take a picture.

905
00:57:44,696 --> 00:57:45,788
Okay.

906
00:57:46,965 --> 00:57:50,401
<i>Pretty woman, walking down the street</i>

907
00:57:50,468 --> 00:57:54,199
<i>Pretty woman, the kind I like to meet</i>

908
00:57:54,272 --> 00:57:56,604
<i>Pretty woman</i>

909
00:57:56,808 --> 00:58:00,175
<i>I don't believe you, you're not the truth</i>

910
00:58:00,611 --> 00:58:04,138
<i>No one could look as good as you</i>

911
00:58:06,951 --> 00:58:08,282
<i>Mercy</i>

912
00:58:12,190 --> 00:58:13,987
<i>Pretty woman...</i>

913
00:58:14,058 --> 00:58:15,082
I don't know.

914
00:58:15,159 --> 00:58:17,855
Like hold the crab.
You need to get over your crab fear.

915
00:58:17,929 --> 00:58:19,021
Nibbling.

916
00:58:19,764 --> 00:58:22,131
<i>Pretty woman</i>

917
00:58:22,201 --> 00:58:26,297
<i>That you look lovely as can be</i>

918
00:58:26,372 --> 00:58:31,571
<i>Are you lonely just like me?</i>

919
00:58:32,444 --> 00:58:36,244
<i>Oh, oh, pretty woman</i>

920
00:58:39,952 --> 00:58:43,149
So. In India do your parents pick out
who you're gonna marry?

921
00:58:44,623 --> 00:58:46,056
Look at that.

922
00:58:46,892 --> 00:58:48,792
Yeah. In a way.

923
00:58:49,995 --> 00:58:52,657
Well. Probably cuts down
on a lot of bad dates.

924
00:58:52,731 --> 00:58:54,665
- And a lot of good ones.
- That's true.

925
00:58:56,735 --> 00:58:58,862
But. You know.

926
00:58:58,937 --> 00:59:01,167
People learn that love grows.

927
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:05,604
It's not like a rose
already blooming in a flower shop.

928
00:59:05,678 --> 00:59:07,873
Well. What if you get
one of those plants that.

929
00:59:07,947 --> 00:59:12,247
You know. You take home.
And after like two days. It just dies?

930
00:59:12,318 --> 00:59:14,252
Better luck next life.

931
00:59:17,023 --> 00:59:18,422
Look at you.

932
00:59:19,659 --> 00:59:21,559
Probably find Priya under Granger.

933
00:59:23,396 --> 00:59:27,856
I mean. You know. The chances of you
finding your name are basically

934
00:59:27,934 --> 00:59:30,402
the same as finding mine...
I'm gonna shut up now.

935
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:36,099
- So. Mr. Cook...
- Yeah.

936
00:59:36,176 --> 00:59:38,838
What about dinner somewhere different?

937
00:59:41,214 --> 00:59:42,841
- I'm game.
- Yeah?

938
00:59:44,150 --> 00:59:45,139
Better.

939
00:59:50,424 --> 00:59:51,516
This is great.

940
00:59:54,895 --> 00:59:56,123
Thank you.

941
00:59:57,364 --> 00:59:59,855
I should tell you that

942
00:59:59,934 --> 01:00:02,835
- I've never had Indian before.
- I know.

943
01:00:04,205 --> 01:00:06,867
But I'm glad
you're trying out something new.

944
01:00:06,941 --> 01:00:11,969
So just dig in. Don't even think about it.
You might just love it.

945
01:00:20,054 --> 01:00:22,079
- Not bad.
- See?

946
01:00:25,292 --> 01:00:28,990
You know. If you ever
wanna impress an Indian family.

947
01:00:29,064 --> 01:00:31,999
You should tell about the things
you really love.

948
01:00:32,067 --> 01:00:35,559
You know. Family. Education.

949
01:00:36,905 --> 01:00:41,604
Food. Marriage. You know. Stuff like that.

950
01:00:42,644 --> 01:00:46,205
So. Your parents putting pressure on you
to get married?

951
01:00:48,984 --> 01:00:51,248
I'll marry someday. You know.

952
01:00:56,191 --> 01:00:57,215
Mmm.

953
01:00:57,292 --> 01:01:00,420
- Let me try.
- No. Leave that!

954
01:01:05,967 --> 01:01:08,060
It's really spicy.

955
01:01:15,811 --> 01:01:17,301
It's very spicy.

956
01:01:18,948 --> 01:01:20,381
- Some more?
- No.

957
01:01:20,449 --> 01:01:21,814
Mmm-hmm. Mmm...

958
01:01:21,884 --> 01:01:23,078
I'm fine.

959
01:01:26,289 --> 01:01:28,780
- Has your tongue cooled down?
- What tongue?

960
01:01:30,092 --> 01:01:32,458
How will you make your little jokes now?

961
01:01:32,528 --> 01:01:33,586
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

962
01:01:33,663 --> 01:01:35,290
Are you being sassy?

963
01:01:35,364 --> 01:01:38,697
You've been here. What. Three days.
And you've already picked up sass?

964
01:01:38,768 --> 01:01:41,999
Couldn't you just take home a magnet
or a T-shirt?

965
01:01:46,175 --> 01:01:50,545
- I always wanted to swim in the ocean.
- What? No. No. No.

966
01:01:50,948 --> 01:01:54,748
You go for it. But I have to warn you. It's...

967
01:01:57,221 --> 01:02:00,247
- It's kind of cold.
- It is not!

968
01:02:05,229 --> 01:02:07,254
Easy.

969
01:02:07,331 --> 01:02:08,798
- Okay. Come on.
- No. No. I'm not going.

970
01:02:08,865 --> 01:02:10,355
- Are you scared?
- Yeah. I'm scared.

971
01:02:10,434 --> 01:02:11,594
- You are?
- There's sharks in there.

972
01:02:11,668 --> 01:02:13,795
Oh. Yeah? I'm a shark then.

973
01:02:16,406 --> 01:02:19,375
<i>It's all I wanna do</i>

974
01:02:21,078 --> 01:02:24,809
<i>Give you the strength to hold on</i>

975
01:02:25,916 --> 01:02:28,749
<i>When we are apart</i>

976
01:02:28,819 --> 01:02:32,221
<i>I give to you my heart</i>

977
01:02:36,628 --> 01:02:38,926
I've had a really great night.

978
01:02:39,197 --> 01:02:40,630
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

979
01:02:41,099 --> 01:02:45,695
<i>Because of who you are</i>

980
01:02:48,773 --> 01:02:51,173
<i>You're beautiful</i>

981
01:02:51,242 --> 01:02:58,114
<i>You're beautiful to me</i>

982
01:02:58,182 --> 01:02:59,945
<i>Yeah</i>

983
01:03:00,952 --> 01:03:03,978
<i>You're beautiful</i>

984
01:03:04,055 --> 01:03:08,424
<i>You're beautiful to me</i>

985
01:03:10,595 --> 01:03:14,555
If you could live your life any way.
What would you want?

986
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:16,565
Like any way.

987
01:03:16,902 --> 01:03:18,164
What would I want?

988
01:03:18,237 --> 01:03:19,465
Mmm-hmm.

989
01:03:20,839 --> 01:03:24,468
You mean besides a dance by the water
with a beautiful woman?

990
01:03:29,248 --> 01:03:30,579
All right.

991
01:03:31,850 --> 01:03:33,283
You still have to answer my question.

992
01:03:33,352 --> 01:03:36,685
I was hoping I could charm my way
out of answering.

993
01:03:37,089 --> 01:03:38,989
Okay. Give me a second.

994
01:03:42,561 --> 01:03:46,224
I guess I don't wanna die a failure.

995
01:03:46,298 --> 01:03:47,959
What do you mean?

996
01:03:49,001 --> 01:03:51,697
That I didn't try hard enough
or something.

997
01:03:51,770 --> 01:03:55,639
Like with my job. You know.
I want to be the best at what I do.

998
01:03:56,409 --> 01:04:00,038
The scary part is putting yourself
and your ideas out there.

999
01:04:00,113 --> 01:04:02,240
What if you crash and burn?

1000
01:04:03,283 --> 01:04:04,944
Isn't it worth it?

1001
01:04:07,921 --> 01:04:12,449
Deep down I guess I'm afraid
it won't work out.

1002
01:04:16,496 --> 01:04:19,659
What about you?
Did you always want to be a nurse?

1003
01:04:21,101 --> 01:04:24,229
No. I...

1004
01:04:29,776 --> 01:04:33,735
I guess I want to do things
that make people happy.

1005
01:04:39,487 --> 01:04:43,048
Well. Maybe you should do something
that makes you happy.

1006
01:04:58,072 --> 01:05:00,097
Turn left. Turn left.
Left. Left. Left. Left.

1007
01:05:00,174 --> 01:05:03,234
PIMMl: Right! Right! Right. Right.
Right. Right.

1008
01:05:03,477 --> 01:05:06,708
No. I don't think so.
Bye. Girls.

1009
01:05:07,214 --> 01:05:10,843
All you told me to get into this right
and now we're stuck in one-way street.

1010
01:05:10,985 --> 01:05:13,510
<i>Ji, you were driving straight
on that crooked street.</i>

1011
01:05:14,188 --> 01:05:18,056
<i>Achha, listen. Why don't we ask
one of these nice gentlemen to help us?</i>

1012
01:05:18,126 --> 01:05:19,354
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- PIMMl: Can you help us please?

1013
01:05:19,428 --> 01:05:23,387
Excuse me. Could you please tell me
where is this Hawksin Hotel?

1014
01:05:23,532 --> 01:05:25,557
- Hi. Handsome.
- Okay. Handsome.

1015
01:05:25,634 --> 01:05:28,432
Can I interest you in some group sex?

1016
01:05:28,503 --> 01:05:31,097
- PIMMl: What?
- No. No. No. No. Don't. Don't...

1017
01:05:31,173 --> 01:05:32,504
Hawksin Street. Where is that?

1018
01:05:32,574 --> 01:05:35,873
Excuse me. We just wanted to know
where is the... No. No. No. No.

1019
01:05:35,944 --> 01:05:38,003
We don't like that. No. No.

1020
01:05:39,514 --> 01:05:41,482
Come on. Let's go party.

1021
01:05:42,684 --> 01:05:44,481
- Driving. Driving.
- PIMMl: Let's go!

1022
01:05:56,932 --> 01:05:59,925
Excuse me.
I was wondering if you've seen a girl.

1023
01:06:00,002 --> 01:06:02,493
Age 23. height is... How much?

1024
01:06:02,572 --> 01:06:04,130
- Very pretty.
Very pretty.

1025
01:06:04,207 --> 01:06:07,370
And she was seen here in your hotel
with a gentleman.

1026
01:06:07,443 --> 01:06:10,435
And I think the meeting was quite explicit.

1027
01:06:10,513 --> 01:06:13,107
I'm sorry. Sir. But I can't comment
on the activities of any of our guests.

1028
01:06:13,182 --> 01:06:15,412
Excuse me. Did you say you were looking
for a young Indian girl?

1029
01:06:15,485 --> 01:06:17,112
Yes! Yes. Yes. Yes.

1030
01:06:17,186 --> 01:06:19,780
I think I know the girl. I should.
I gave her a hotel room last night.

1031
01:06:21,023 --> 01:06:23,583
Pretty girl.
No. I'm saying good-looking kid.

1032
01:06:23,659 --> 01:06:24,717
Oh. My God!

1033
01:06:24,794 --> 01:06:26,455
Wait a minute.
Is this about me paying for it?

1034
01:06:26,529 --> 01:06:28,588
'Cause I'll be honest with you.
I do it all the time.

1035
01:06:28,664 --> 01:06:30,723
You are the one who has
kidnapped my daughter!

1036
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:32,995
Hey. Kidnapped? Take it easy.
Buddy. She wanted it.

1037
01:06:33,069 --> 01:06:34,696
- She liked it.
- Yeah.

1038
01:06:34,770 --> 01:06:35,964
Is she with you?

1039
01:06:36,038 --> 01:06:38,472
No. No. No. I was with her last night.

1040
01:06:38,541 --> 01:06:41,773
Tonight she's probably with a guy I know.
Maybe two. He's got a partner.

1041
01:06:41,845 --> 01:06:43,745
- Where is my daughter?
- Hey. Hey!

1042
01:06:43,814 --> 01:06:45,839
Where's my daughter?
- You wanna call somebody?

1043
01:06:45,916 --> 01:06:47,543
<i>- Leave me!
- No. ji!</i>

1044
01:06:48,819 --> 01:06:49,808
No!

1045
01:06:49,887 --> 01:06:51,650
This is outrageous!

1046
01:07:07,471 --> 01:07:13,273
Well. Thank you for a very memorable
and very wet evening.

1047
01:07:14,411 --> 01:07:16,709
- I had fun today.
- Me. Too.

1048
01:07:19,216 --> 01:07:20,547
Good night.

1049
01:07:21,952 --> 01:07:24,945
Unless. You know. You want to

1050
01:07:28,826 --> 01:07:30,316
grab a drink.

1051
01:07:30,595 --> 01:07:33,257
Do you know they charge $8 for a cola?

1052
01:07:38,369 --> 01:07:39,666
Oh. Uh...

1053
01:07:44,342 --> 01:07:47,106
I need to get out of these wet clothes.

1054
01:07:49,113 --> 01:07:50,444
In my room.

1055
01:07:51,950 --> 01:07:53,281
With me.

1056
01:08:04,797 --> 01:08:06,196
Good night.

1057
01:08:06,498 --> 01:08:07,692
Night.

1058
01:08:12,004 --> 01:08:15,462
<i>Zia, I called you at work today,
but you were not there.</i>

1059
01:08:16,375 --> 01:08:20,311
I just want to let you know
that I think I am in love.

1060
01:08:21,814 --> 01:08:24,112
And I don't wanna marry Vikram.

1061
01:08:25,884 --> 01:08:28,444
Something could happen with Granger.

1062
01:08:29,688 --> 01:08:34,921
I have to go to my cousin's party today.
But then I will tell him about Vikram.

1063
01:08:36,829 --> 01:08:40,765
So. What's going on
with you two. Anyway?

1064
01:08:41,667 --> 01:08:42,895
Nothing.

1065
01:08:44,336 --> 01:08:46,669
She's going back to India on Monday.

1066
01:08:46,740 --> 01:08:50,642
- And. What. You go back to Emory?
- I don't know.

1067
01:08:50,710 --> 01:08:54,976
You know.
Emory. She looks good on paper.

1068
01:08:55,048 --> 01:08:58,245
I just never really felt it with Emory.
You know?

1069
01:08:59,686 --> 01:09:00,710
No.

1070
01:09:07,794 --> 01:09:09,659
Thanks for driving me.

1071
01:09:10,830 --> 01:09:15,790
Well. Palo Alto is pretty far. I don't know
how else you were gonna get there.

1072
01:09:15,869 --> 01:09:17,461
No. I wanted to.

1073
01:09:20,507 --> 01:09:23,806
So. Do you have to leave tomorrow?

1074
01:09:26,980 --> 01:09:32,476
I mean. I know we just met
and this probably sounds crazy.

1075
01:09:32,586 --> 01:09:36,784
But maybe you could stay longer.

1076
01:09:36,857 --> 01:09:40,293
You know. I just got my presentation
but after that...

1077
01:09:42,697 --> 01:09:45,222
For how long do you want me to stay?

1078
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:49,392
I don't know.
I didn't really think about it.

1079
01:09:51,238 --> 01:09:52,364
Uh...

1080
01:09:54,508 --> 01:09:56,499
- This is the exit.
- Okay.

1081
01:09:58,145 --> 01:09:59,237
So...

1082
01:10:02,083 --> 01:10:04,210
Which way do you wanna go?

1083
01:10:04,285 --> 01:10:05,752
I don't know.

1084
01:10:06,287 --> 01:10:10,657
Okay. Well. You've got a 50-50 shot.
Right or left?

1085
01:10:12,194 --> 01:10:17,632
I'm sorry. Right. No. I mean. Go left. Left.

1086
01:10:17,699 --> 01:10:19,132
Left it is.

1087
01:10:25,907 --> 01:10:28,467
- Granger...
- Yeah?

1088
01:10:36,251 --> 01:10:39,846
- It's the second house on the right.
- Oh. Okay.

1089
01:10:48,864 --> 01:10:52,767
I would invite you inside.
But I have a rather crazy family.

1090
01:10:52,835 --> 01:10:53,824
Who doesn't?

1091
01:10:55,872 --> 01:10:58,363
So. Are you gonna need a ride back?

1092
01:10:58,775 --> 01:10:59,901
Um...

1093
01:11:00,343 --> 01:11:02,277
I'll see what's going on inside.

1094
01:11:02,345 --> 01:11:06,213
I need to spend some quality time
with my family.

1095
01:11:06,282 --> 01:11:09,581
And I'll call your cell
once the quality is over.

1096
01:11:09,652 --> 01:11:13,213
- Hey. Don't you want my number?
- I have it.

1097
01:11:14,190 --> 01:11:17,284
I don't ever remember
giving you my cell phone.

1098
01:11:18,394 --> 01:11:22,888
Yeah. Right. I don't have it. I guess
I was thinking about somebody else.

1099
01:11:23,166 --> 01:11:24,326
Uh...

1100
01:11:25,268 --> 01:11:27,668
I'll call you at the hotel. Yeah?

1101
01:11:30,740 --> 01:11:33,869
- So. I'll see you after your thing?
- Yeah.

1102
01:11:33,944 --> 01:11:35,809
Call me.

1103
01:11:35,879 --> 01:11:37,210
- Bye.
- Bye.

1104
01:11:38,949 --> 01:11:41,577
You did not just say that. "Call me?"

1105
01:11:59,002 --> 01:12:00,993
Auntie.
- Priya!

1106
01:12:01,071 --> 01:12:03,301
- Happy birthday!
- Thank you.

1107
01:12:03,407 --> 01:12:04,431
- Hi.
- Hi.

1108
01:12:12,816 --> 01:12:14,148
Do you remember me?

1109
01:12:24,362 --> 01:12:25,829
Come. Let me show you around.

1110
01:12:25,897 --> 01:12:27,421
You must eat something.

1111
01:12:27,498 --> 01:12:31,434
Pretty girl like you. Your future husband
could have something to grab on.

1112
01:12:31,502 --> 01:12:32,491
Yeah. Auntie.

1113
01:12:45,717 --> 01:12:49,209
I heard you're doing very well.
Working for a big American company.

1114
01:12:52,557 --> 01:12:55,891
- Your family must be very proud of you.
- I think so.

1115
01:13:05,437 --> 01:13:06,597
Priya!

1116
01:13:10,276 --> 01:13:11,470
Hello?

1117
01:13:14,046 --> 01:13:17,538
Hi. I'm Granger. Nice to meet you.

1118
01:13:19,218 --> 01:13:21,379
It's so nice. Papa.
That you've come for the party.

1119
01:13:21,453 --> 01:13:22,442
Not another lie.

1120
01:13:23,389 --> 01:13:24,447
Hi. How are you?

1121
01:13:25,224 --> 01:13:26,452
Hello. Hello.

1122
01:13:26,525 --> 01:13:27,719
Granger Woodruff.

1123
01:13:28,060 --> 01:13:31,052
I know why you are here
and it's certainly not for the family.

1124
01:13:31,130 --> 01:13:33,189
Now where is the man
you've eloped with. Huh?

1125
01:13:33,299 --> 01:13:36,826
<i>- What?
- Ji, ji, I think that is him.</i>

1126
01:13:36,902 --> 01:13:39,565
Priya. You left this in my car.

1127
01:13:40,473 --> 01:13:42,441
I don't want you
to address my daughter. Okay?

1128
01:13:42,509 --> 01:13:43,635
Papa.

1129
01:13:45,011 --> 01:13:48,469
Mr. Sethi. Granger Woodruff.
Pleasure to meet you. Sir.

1130
01:13:49,349 --> 01:13:51,909
What pleasure? Where is the pleasure?

1131
01:13:51,985 --> 01:13:54,044
Granger. Thanks for the present.
Can I talk to you later. Please?

1132
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:55,644
No.

1133
01:13:55,755 --> 01:13:59,885
I want to know what you told my daughter
to lure her to America.

1134
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:03,760
- What? What's your father talking about?
- Can we go to your car?

1135
01:14:03,863 --> 01:14:06,559
You thought you will bring
an innocent girl here

1136
01:14:06,633 --> 01:14:08,760
and I will not find you?

1137
01:14:08,835 --> 01:14:11,531
Sir. Sir. I just met your daughter
a few days ago.

1138
01:14:11,604 --> 01:14:14,368
I'm not trying to lure her anywhere.

1139
01:14:14,441 --> 01:14:16,136
- You are her customer.
- Papa...

1140
01:14:16,209 --> 01:14:20,044
I mean. For the credit card company.
Don't you lie to us. Zia told us everything.

1141
01:14:20,114 --> 01:14:21,775
Thank God.
Vikram's family does not know anything.

1142
01:14:21,849 --> 01:14:23,976
Otherwise. You know
what could have happened.

1143
01:14:24,051 --> 01:14:25,348
Credit card company?

1144
01:14:25,419 --> 01:14:28,582
Yes. That horrible job
which makes her work the whole night

1145
01:14:28,656 --> 01:14:30,590
<i>pretending to be an Americano.</i>

1146
01:14:30,658 --> 01:14:35,721
Are you discussing Priya's job?
She does a fantastic American accent.

1147
01:14:35,796 --> 01:14:40,290
Come on. Do your Streisand voice.
It's just terrific.

1148
01:14:40,368 --> 01:14:43,132
I'm sure your fiance must enjoy it.

1149
01:14:45,506 --> 01:14:47,064
You're engaged?

1150
01:14:48,142 --> 01:14:50,667
Oh. No. No. No. No.
He's not asking as a jealous boyfriend.

1151
01:14:50,745 --> 01:14:54,044
He's asking merely
as a polite conversation starter.

1152
01:14:55,683 --> 01:14:56,809
Priya!

1153
01:14:57,718 --> 01:14:59,583
Priya! Where are you going?

1154
01:15:00,154 --> 01:15:02,953
Look. I'm not going anywhere
until you tell me what the hell is going on.

1155
01:15:03,025 --> 01:15:05,755
Granger. Not here. Please. Come.

1156
01:15:08,563 --> 01:15:11,225
You wanna tell me
who you really are?

1157
01:15:11,299 --> 01:15:13,927
I'm Priya Sethi. I live in Mumbai.
Just like I told you.

1158
01:15:14,002 --> 01:15:15,799
And who else are you?

1159
01:15:17,439 --> 01:15:21,034
I'm Jennifer David
from CITYone Bank Business Processes.

1160
01:15:22,711 --> 01:15:26,112
Say something else. Say something else.

1161
01:15:27,716 --> 01:15:29,684
I'll be happy to assist you
in increasing your credit limit.

1162
01:15:29,751 --> 01:15:31,218
If you wouldn't mind
answering a few questions.

1163
01:15:31,286 --> 01:15:34,414
Okay. All right. I got it.

1164
01:15:37,325 --> 01:15:38,690
I'm sorry.

1165
01:15:50,740 --> 01:15:53,470
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I was going to.

1166
01:15:55,745 --> 01:15:58,339
I didn't think you'd like the real me.

1167
01:15:59,882 --> 01:16:03,045
You're engaged. Is that how they celebrate
in your country?

1168
01:16:03,119 --> 01:16:05,553
I don't love him. I...

1169
01:16:06,889 --> 01:16:11,826
I'm sorry I didn't tell you everything.
I pretend for my job.

1170
01:16:14,797 --> 01:16:17,891
But the truth is everything else
I've told you.

1171
01:16:19,902 --> 01:16:22,132
I don't know what to believe.

1172
01:16:25,676 --> 01:16:28,668
You know what? Forget it.

1173
01:16:28,745 --> 01:16:32,806
Yeah. I've known you
for. What. A few days?

1174
01:16:32,883 --> 01:16:38,048
Let's not blow this thing out of proportion.
It was fun. Let's just leave it at that.

1175
01:16:38,122 --> 01:16:39,783
Granger. Please...

1176
01:16:52,169 --> 01:16:53,397
Damn it!

1177
01:16:53,470 --> 01:16:55,665
Stay away
from my daughter. Okay?

1178
01:16:55,739 --> 01:16:57,331
Who is that guy?

1179
01:16:57,407 --> 01:16:58,772
Oh. My God.

1180
01:17:09,754 --> 01:17:13,349
I always imagined Indian parties
to be peaceful affairs.

1181
01:17:13,424 --> 01:17:19,988
<i>You know. Gandhi-esque. Incense
and Kama Sutra.</i>

1182
01:17:21,199 --> 01:17:23,167
Never have expectations.

1183
01:17:24,269 --> 01:17:27,500
- You know what your deal is?
- No. What's my deal?

1184
01:17:27,572 --> 01:17:30,234
You never totally put yourself out there.

1185
01:17:30,308 --> 01:17:32,401
You round the corners and you play it safe.

1186
01:17:32,477 --> 01:17:34,638
You never let people
see who you really are.

1187
01:17:34,712 --> 01:17:37,772
But you're selling yourself short. Man.
Tired of watching you do that.

1188
01:17:37,849 --> 01:17:41,979
If you want big rewards.
You have to take the big risks.

1189
01:17:42,053 --> 01:17:45,113
But you're afraid.
So you wind up with nothing.

1190
01:17:48,694 --> 01:17:53,222
Wow! This girl really took you out.

1191
01:17:53,299 --> 01:17:56,564
So what? I'm just supposed to tell her
to leave her fiance

1192
01:17:56,635 --> 01:17:58,432
and move to America to be with me?

1193
01:17:58,504 --> 01:18:00,938
I don't even know
if I'm gonna have a job next week.

1194
01:18:01,006 --> 01:18:02,530
She pretended to be someone she wasn't.

1195
01:18:02,608 --> 01:18:05,372
Maybe that's who she needed to be
to have her big adventure.

1196
01:18:05,444 --> 01:18:09,312
Haven't you ever pretended to be someone
you're not. Granger?

1197
01:18:15,287 --> 01:18:19,917
For the last 37 years
at Hawksin Hotels. It's been our passion...

1198
01:18:33,773 --> 01:18:37,368
- Happy birthday.
- Emory? What are you doing here?

1199
01:18:38,311 --> 01:18:40,643
Well. I came to wish you a happy birthday.

1200
01:18:40,714 --> 01:18:44,115
Well. It's not my birthday.
And I thought we broke up.

1201
01:18:44,184 --> 01:18:45,674
I forgive you.

1202
01:18:49,289 --> 01:18:51,450
- Good luck. Priya.
- Thank you.

1203
01:18:53,126 --> 01:18:55,356
Emory. I...

1204
01:18:55,428 --> 01:18:58,556
Em... Em. Em. I can't do this. Okay?

1205
01:18:58,632 --> 01:19:01,499
I'm here for work.
I don't have time for this.

1206
01:19:01,568 --> 01:19:05,163
Okay. Whatever. You know.
It's actually probably for the best.

1207
01:19:05,238 --> 01:19:08,799
Since I wouldn't want
to remember us both naked when I do it.

1208
01:19:08,875 --> 01:19:11,777
- Do what?
- Propose. You jerk.

1209
01:19:13,314 --> 01:19:14,440
What?

1210
01:19:17,451 --> 01:19:21,581
- You're joking. Right?
- No. And that better not be your answer.

1211
01:19:23,157 --> 01:19:26,684
I just thought. You know.
We were seeing other people.

1212
01:19:26,761 --> 01:19:30,993
- You know. Mark Bailey. Private jets.
- Let's review. Sweetie. Okay?

1213
01:19:31,065 --> 01:19:34,796
We are both good-looking.
We both went to Ivy League schools.

1214
01:19:36,170 --> 01:19:37,933
The sex is amazing.

1215
01:19:39,273 --> 01:19:41,605
You make it sound like a merger.

1216
01:19:44,345 --> 01:19:48,406
You're never going to find anyone
better than me. And you know it.

1217
01:19:49,383 --> 01:19:50,645
Em. Em...

1218
01:20:01,863 --> 01:20:03,592
Priya.

1219
01:20:03,665 --> 01:20:06,259
Before you close your door. Please...

1220
01:20:09,938 --> 01:20:14,102
I know I should have had told you
I was engaged. I'm sorry.

1221
01:20:16,978 --> 01:20:21,574
But the truth is.
Maybe I did come all the way

1222
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:25,848
wanting a romantic moment
with someone I've never met

1223
01:20:25,921 --> 01:20:29,618
because maybe I was running away
from my life.

1224
01:20:29,691 --> 01:20:35,824
And then I met you. My feet stayed still.
Maybe they floated a little.

1225
01:20:40,303 --> 01:20:44,034
I couldn't leave tomorrow
without you knowing how I feel.

1226
01:20:44,107 --> 01:20:47,702
- And I hope that maybe you've...
- Grange?

1227
01:20:47,777 --> 01:20:51,406
Is my fiance bugging you for towels again?

1228
01:20:51,481 --> 01:20:53,278
- It's not...
- Necessary.

1229
01:20:53,349 --> 01:20:55,943
Oh. And we're not going
to need turndown service later

1230
01:20:56,018 --> 01:20:58,816
because. Well.
We're just going to mess it up.

1231
01:20:58,888 --> 01:21:00,913
Just give me a minute. Em.

1232
01:21:01,958 --> 01:21:03,186
Hey!

1233
01:21:03,259 --> 01:21:07,218
You don't need to explain it to the maid.
It's a hotel. For gosh sake!

1234
01:21:07,296 --> 01:21:08,786
- Look. I'm...
- That's right.

1235
01:21:08,865 --> 01:21:09,923
I should have looked.

1236
01:21:11,067 --> 01:21:13,058
Then I'd have seen what a hypocrite...

1237
01:21:13,136 --> 01:21:16,300
That's the English word. Right?
Someone like you.

1238
01:21:18,308 --> 01:21:23,371
You're going back to India to your fiance.
What do you want me to do?

1239
01:21:29,420 --> 01:21:31,820
You'll like this one.
So these two lawyers go to heaven.

1240
01:21:31,889 --> 01:21:34,153
And they meet Saint Peter...
You guys heard of Saint Peter?

1241
01:21:35,392 --> 01:21:37,758
Let's just walk around
the man in the towel.

1242
01:21:38,996 --> 01:21:41,362
Which reminds me.
Those are the 300 count cotton towels.

1243
01:21:41,432 --> 01:21:43,957
Egyptian cotton. Too. I think it's the best.

1244
01:22:09,627 --> 01:22:13,290
<i>At Hawksin Hotels

1248
01:22:23,475 --> 01:22:25,773
<i>nice people like you.</i>

1249
01:22:39,558 --> 01:22:41,651
So what do you think. Mr. Hawksin?

1250
01:22:51,604 --> 01:22:52,969
I loved it.

1251
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:04,113
- Welcome to the Hawksin family. Boys.
- Yes!

1252
01:23:05,651 --> 01:23:07,516
- Thank you very much. Sir.
- "Nice people like you. "

1253
01:23:07,586 --> 01:23:10,316
- I like that. It's a good touch.
- Thank you. I got it...

1254
01:23:24,271 --> 01:23:26,398
What is the meaning of all this?

1255
01:23:26,473 --> 01:23:30,273
- You're home so soon?
- Wow. Full on rager.

1256
01:23:30,343 --> 01:23:32,811
Who told you you could have a party?
And what are you celebrating?

1257
01:23:32,879 --> 01:23:33,971
Ow!

1258
01:23:34,047 --> 01:23:38,416
That's it. My children are hooligans.
I've done nothing right.

1259
01:23:38,485 --> 01:23:39,645
Just go to weeds.

1260
01:23:39,719 --> 01:23:41,186
Oh. No. Please. Please. Please. One minute.

1261
01:23:41,254 --> 01:23:43,245
He is probably following
the example of his sister

1262
01:23:43,323 --> 01:23:45,052
to see who can humiliate the family more.

1263
01:23:45,125 --> 01:23:48,561
He with the party or she who ran away
to America with some stranger.

1264
01:23:48,628 --> 01:23:51,620
Definitely the one who ran away.

1265
01:23:51,698 --> 01:23:54,132
- Nothing happened.
- Nothing happened?

1266
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:56,361
You spent all your money
just to go to America?

1267
01:23:56,436 --> 01:23:58,233
Thank God. The only blessed thing
that has happened

1268
01:23:58,305 --> 01:24:00,034
the Bhatias have not found out.

1269
01:24:00,106 --> 01:24:03,565
Oh. By the way.
Mr. Bhatia had left a message.

1270
01:24:03,644 --> 01:24:05,544
He found out what happened
from Uncle Sawant.

1271
01:24:06,814 --> 01:24:11,148
<i>Dad. Dad.
- Ji, ji, ji, ji, you're going to have a stroke.</i>

1272
01:24:11,218 --> 01:24:14,415
Tomorrow. You're going to Bhatia's place.
Kiss their feet

1273
01:24:14,488 --> 01:24:16,388
and apologize
for what you have done. Okay?

1274
01:24:16,457 --> 01:24:19,358
And beg forgiveness with the hope
that they let this marriage take place.

1275
01:24:19,427 --> 01:24:21,190
- What if...
- Not. What if. Anything.

1276
01:24:21,262 --> 01:24:22,695
The only thing you're supposed to see

1277
01:24:22,763 --> 01:24:26,130
is to obey your father and most probably
that future husband of yours.

1278
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:27,963
Now go to your room.

1279
01:24:29,470 --> 01:24:30,767
- Papa.
- What?

1280
01:24:30,838 --> 01:24:34,274
Please try to understand.
I don't want to marry Vikram.

1281
01:24:34,342 --> 01:24:37,971
Papa. Vikram is a perfectly nice boy.

1282
01:24:38,045 --> 01:24:41,708
It's just. I know he won't make me happy.

1283
01:24:41,782 --> 01:24:44,581
What? What did she say? Happy?

1284
01:24:46,021 --> 01:24:49,184
You think I was happy
when I met your mother?

1285
01:24:49,257 --> 01:24:51,157
I mean...

1286
01:24:51,226 --> 01:24:55,322
But now. Just look at us.
We have grown to be happy.

1287
01:24:55,397 --> 01:24:58,093
Till our children came to make us crazy.

1288
01:24:58,166 --> 01:25:00,999
So don't you talk to me
about being happy.

1289
01:25:02,738 --> 01:25:06,572
All my life I've been thinking
about making other people happy.

1290
01:25:06,642 --> 01:25:10,578
Now. I need to know what makes me
happy. Not you. You or Vikram.

1291
01:25:10,646 --> 01:25:13,274
What is this me. Me. Me?
Crazy American talk!

1292
01:25:13,348 --> 01:25:18,376
Okay. Okay. Priya.
You see. You are part of a family.

1293
01:25:19,087 --> 01:25:23,581
And you are not entitled to hog
all the happiness just for yourself.

1294
01:25:23,659 --> 01:25:26,652
There are other people in this family
who also want to be happy.

1295
01:25:26,729 --> 01:25:31,632
But what you've done all this time?
Just break our hearts.

1296
01:25:32,135 --> 01:25:35,127
<i>- Ji, ji, ji...
- No. No...</i>

1297
01:25:35,204 --> 01:25:40,506
<i>Ji, you're not feeling well.
I'll talk to her. Huh?</i>

1298
01:25:41,411 --> 01:25:43,971
Priya...

1299
01:25:48,117 --> 01:25:51,746
Look. Priya.
This marriage is not just about you.

1300
01:25:52,255 --> 01:25:54,155
It is for us.

1301
01:25:54,624 --> 01:25:56,819
<i>This will help our family. beta.</i>

1302
01:25:56,893 --> 01:25:59,953
Look at your father.
See how hard he works.

1303
01:26:00,697 --> 01:26:03,666
This is important. Priya. Huh?

1304
01:26:07,404 --> 01:26:09,599
<i>Family's important. beta.</i>

1305
01:26:10,074 --> 01:26:13,601
It is who will always
be there for you. Huh?

1306
01:26:15,512 --> 01:26:18,379
<i>This is the air I breathe</i>

1307
01:26:32,596 --> 01:26:34,996
- Knock. Knock. Hi.
- Hey.

1308
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:39,692
Look. I know we haven't had a
chance to talk. Really. Since San Francisco.

1309
01:26:39,770 --> 01:26:42,568
You know. I wanted to tell you that if
the wedding stuff is too much for you.

1310
01:26:42,639 --> 01:26:45,938
Let's just celebrate
your new account. Okay?

1311
01:26:46,009 --> 01:26:48,604
Look. It's your favorite.

1312
01:26:56,354 --> 01:27:00,222
- It's not working.
- What. Did you lose the account?

1313
01:27:07,465 --> 01:27:08,454
Right.

1314
01:27:12,637 --> 01:27:13,626
Okay.

1315
01:27:18,243 --> 01:27:22,612
Once again. And make it sound
this time like you mean it.

1316
01:27:24,182 --> 01:27:26,912
- I'm terribly sorry.
- Louder. louder.

1317
01:27:30,089 --> 01:27:31,886
I'm terribly sorry. Uncle. Auntie.

1318
01:27:31,957 --> 01:27:34,517
I've gotten everything out of my system.

1319
01:27:34,593 --> 01:27:36,754
And I assure you
I'm ready to be a devoted...

1320
01:27:36,829 --> 01:27:38,023
Devoted wife and mother.

1321
01:27:39,365 --> 01:27:42,334
I'm ready to devote myself to...

1322
01:27:42,401 --> 01:27:43,834
Come on.

1323
01:27:49,208 --> 01:27:54,168
I'm ready to devote myself to my job
and finding things that make me happy.

1324
01:27:55,648 --> 01:27:59,140
'Cause I lied. I haven't gotten
everything out of my system.

1325
01:27:59,218 --> 01:28:03,120
What system?
She's too young to have a system.

1326
01:28:03,889 --> 01:28:05,948
She's nervous.

1327
01:28:06,826 --> 01:28:10,887
She's embarrassed and she's afraid

1328
01:28:10,963 --> 01:28:14,024
because she thinks that
you will not accept her apology.

1329
01:28:14,100 --> 01:28:16,398
Isn't that right. Priya. Huh?

1330
01:28:17,437 --> 01:28:22,875
I'm sorry. Vikram is a lovely person.

1331
01:28:24,044 --> 01:28:27,878
And I know. Vikram. You'll find someone
who'll make you happy.

1332
01:28:28,014 --> 01:28:30,448
But I don't believe it's me.

1333
01:28:34,821 --> 01:28:36,721
I know I'm disappointing you.

1334
01:28:37,691 --> 01:28:40,251
It's just. Something happened
when I was gone.

1335
01:28:41,127 --> 01:28:42,924
I jumped in the ocean.

1336
01:28:44,564 --> 01:28:46,623
I got sick eating chocolates.

1337
01:28:47,934 --> 01:28:49,561
I just fell in love.

1338
01:28:51,671 --> 01:28:53,401
Is this man here with you?

1339
01:28:54,008 --> 01:28:56,704
No. Vikram. It's just...

1340
01:28:57,345 --> 01:28:59,370
I realize I need something else.

1341
01:28:59,947 --> 01:29:03,974
I told you they're all mad as hatters.
Didn't I? Didn't I?

1342
01:29:04,051 --> 01:29:06,611
How dare you do this to our son?

1343
01:29:07,154 --> 01:29:09,714
- It's not enough that you...
- Now. That is okay.

1344
01:29:09,790 --> 01:29:12,953
We have a whole file full of girls in there.

1345
01:29:13,027 --> 01:29:16,793
And I really always wanted to
meet Lavina from Gwalior.

1346
01:29:16,864 --> 01:29:19,662
No. It's not all right. Vikram.
It's not all right.

1347
01:29:19,734 --> 01:29:23,170
This little tramp runs off to America.
Then stands here and breaks your heart...

1348
01:29:23,237 --> 01:29:29,142
She's not a tramp! She's not a tramp.

1349
01:29:32,413 --> 01:29:34,108
She's a dreamer.

1350
01:29:36,285 --> 01:29:38,617
Her ideas are modern.

1351
01:29:39,121 --> 01:29:42,887
Yes. Sometimes she's stubborn and willful.

1352
01:29:42,958 --> 01:29:46,519
But when she walks into a room.
People smile.

1353
01:29:48,730 --> 01:29:52,461
When she talks. People listen.

1354
01:29:54,269 --> 01:29:56,931
She's wise. She's kind.

1355
01:29:59,241 --> 01:30:03,337
And most importantly. She's my daughter.

1356
01:30:05,814 --> 01:30:07,406
And I love her.

1357
01:30:07,616 --> 01:30:08,708
Papa.

1358
01:30:15,357 --> 01:30:16,757
Thank you.

01:30:44,187 --> 01:30:45,848
as an American.

1366
01:30:47,190 --> 01:30:49,090
<i>You'll have an American name,</i>

1367
01:30:49,726 --> 01:30:52,217
<i>an American city of residence,</i>

1368
01:30:53,896 --> 01:30:59,301
<i>but it's very important to remember
that you're not an American.</i>

1369
01:31:01,472 --> 01:31:06,774
You're an Indian
and your American identity is simply there

1370
01:31:07,478 --> 01:31:11,107
<i>to make it easier for you to communicate</i>

1371
01:31:11,181 --> 01:31:14,844
with the person
at the other end of the line.

1372
01:31:14,918 --> 01:31:19,685
But you must leave it at your desk
the moment you take off the headset.

1373
01:31:19,757 --> 01:31:21,850
<i>I'm desperate for you</i>

1374
01:31:31,301 --> 01:31:35,897
Excuse me. Everybody. It's time
for the customary best man speech.

1375
01:31:37,508 --> 01:31:41,639
When Charlie and I were 14.
We went to Camp Whichiwawa

1376
01:31:43,148 --> 01:31:46,208
And being the mischievous
little fellows that we were.

1377
01:31:46,284 --> 01:31:49,583
One night we decided to
sneak across to the girls' cabins.

1378
01:31:49,654 --> 01:31:54,148
Now. The only way to get over to Camp
Whichiwuwu was over this little river.

1379
01:31:54,592 --> 01:31:59,723
Now. To the 14-year-old me. In the middle
of the night. It looked like the Mississippi.

1380
01:32:00,065 --> 01:32:03,796
You know. So I say to Charlie.
I say. "Dude. I'm not going in there.

1381
01:32:03,868 --> 01:32:08,703
"It's probably full of snakes and eels
and crocodiles. "

1382
01:32:08,773 --> 01:32:11,708
And by the time I'd finished
listing all my reasons.

1383
01:32:11,776 --> 01:32:14,768
Chucky boy here was already
on the other side.

1384
01:32:14,846 --> 01:32:18,077
I chickened out
and went back to the cabins.

1385
01:32:18,483 --> 01:32:23,114
But Charlie here.
He forged ahead to the girls' cabins

1386
01:32:23,923 --> 01:32:27,154
and he met a young lady that night.
Believe it or not.

1387
01:32:29,361 --> 01:32:31,522
A young lady named Karen Miller.

1388
01:32:32,631 --> 01:32:34,622
Now. When Charlie got back to the bunks.
He says to me. He says.

1389
01:32:34,700 --> 01:32:38,295
"Dude. Dude. I just met the girl
I'm gonna marry. "

1390
01:32:40,206 --> 01:32:45,667
Flash forward 10 years later. Charlie and I
are at a barbeque at Massapequa or

1391
01:32:46,278 --> 01:32:52,217
Quitipeak or Quahog or somewhere.
Then he sees her across the room.

1392
01:32:53,552 --> 01:32:55,349
Now. Charlie was on a date that night.

1393
01:32:55,421 --> 01:32:56,945
But he left her just like he left me

1394
01:32:57,022 --> 01:32:59,650
on the other side of that river
10 years earlier.

1395
01:32:59,725 --> 01:33:04,129
And me being the voice of reason.
I say to Charlie. I say. "You can't leave. "

1396
01:33:04,531 --> 01:33:06,965
And he turns to me and
he says something I'll never forget.

1397
01:33:07,033 --> 01:33:11,868
He says. "Nothing should ever hold a man
back from his future. "

1398
01:33:13,140 --> 01:33:16,439
Nothing should ever hold a man
back from his future.

1399
01:33:20,847 --> 01:33:26,046
So. To my best friend. Charlie.
Who wasn't afraid to cross the river.

1400
01:33:29,222 --> 01:33:32,817
And to Karen.
Who was waiting for him on the other...

1401
01:33:51,412 --> 01:33:53,004
I gotta go.

1402
01:34:05,760 --> 01:34:07,591
Taxi! Hey!

1403
01:34:11,232 --> 01:34:14,531
How're you doing?
Airport. As fast as you can.

1404
01:34:16,003 --> 01:34:20,702
<i>Hear me out, don't tear away
'Cause this is what I'm trying to say</i>

1405
01:34:20,775 --> 01:34:25,543
Hey. Hey. Would you mind stepping on it?
I got to get to the airport in 40 minutes.

1406
01:34:25,614 --> 01:34:27,138
Hey. Dude. I'm trying to go as fast as I can.

1407
01:34:27,216 --> 01:34:29,707
Okay. Thank you. Okay. Thanks.
Very important.

1408
01:34:29,785 --> 01:34:30,843
- Appreciate it.
- Sure.

1409
01:34:30,919 --> 01:34:34,912
Hi. Hi. Yes.
I need information for Mumbai. India.

1410
01:34:35,490 --> 01:34:37,583
Yeah. I can hold.

1411
01:34:38,360 --> 01:34:45,027
Yes. Yes. I'm here. I'm looking for the
address to CITYone Bank Headquarters.

1412
01:34:45,867 --> 01:34:49,803
C- I-T-I. Yes. Yes.

1413
01:34:49,871 --> 01:34:54,103
Wait. Wait. Wait. Slow down.
I can't understand you. I...

1414
01:34:54,309 --> 01:34:57,107
- Hold. Hold on. Please.
- Come on!

1415
01:34:57,479 --> 01:34:59,947
- Excuse me. Hey. Buddy...
- What?

1416
01:35:00,082 --> 01:35:01,549
Would you mind translating
for me. Please?

1417
01:35:01,617 --> 01:35:05,212
Okay. Just because I'm brown and driving
a taxi doesn't mean I can speak Indian.

1418
01:35:05,287 --> 01:35:07,620
No. No. No. No. No. No. I didn't mean that.

1419
01:35:07,690 --> 01:35:09,453
Dude. I'm playing. I'm playing with you.
Give me the phone.

1420
01:35:09,525 --> 01:35:11,220
- Thanks. Man. Thank you.
- It's all right.

1421
01:35:16,266 --> 01:35:19,667
CITYone Bank address. Headquarters.
Mumbai.

1422
01:35:19,736 --> 01:35:21,897
I can write down. I have a pen.

1423
01:35:23,773 --> 01:35:26,674
<i>I can't see your face</i>

1424
01:35:26,743 --> 01:35:28,870
<i>You're calling out my name</i>

1425
01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:35,078
<i>I can hear you calling out my name</i>

1426
01:35:35,151 --> 01:35:37,051
Hey. Watch it.

1427
01:35:37,120 --> 01:35:39,247
<i>I can't see your face</i>

1428
01:35:39,322 --> 01:35:42,814
<i>But you're calling out my name</i>

1429
01:35:45,495 --> 01:35:51,435
<i>And all this time you let me run</i>

1430
01:35:52,269 --> 01:35:57,935
<i>Look how fast time has gone</i>

1431
01:35:58,676 --> 01:36:03,841
<i>Looking back at what we had</i>

1432
01:36:03,914 --> 01:36:07,111
Hey. Buddy. Can't this thing go any faster?

1433
01:36:08,218 --> 01:36:10,311
Can your cab go any faster?

1434
01:36:22,433 --> 01:36:23,991
Stop and let me out.

1435
01:36:34,979 --> 01:36:36,606
CITYone Bank.

1436
01:36:50,595 --> 01:36:52,290
I'd be glad to help you with that.

1437
01:36:52,364 --> 01:36:55,561
For security purposes. Could you please
give me the last four digits of your social...

1438
01:37:00,638 --> 01:37:03,732
No. You listen to me.
No. Sir. You listen to me.

1439
01:37:04,275 --> 01:37:07,802
Just listen here. Jack.
You better pay up or else...

1440
01:37:08,480 --> 01:37:09,606
He hung up on me.

1441
01:37:09,681 --> 01:37:13,345
Balveer. You must always remember.
They are your customers.

1442
01:37:13,419 --> 01:37:17,788
So. Do not let things get personal.
This is a business. Right?

1443
01:37:18,023 --> 01:37:22,289
And your job is to be professional.
Calm and helpful.

1444
01:37:22,695 --> 01:37:24,026
But we must get the money.

1445
01:37:24,096 --> 01:37:26,963
How can we let these obnoxious
Americans talk to us like this?

1446
01:37:27,032 --> 01:37:30,559
What happens if the obnoxious American
is also a complete idiot?

1447
01:37:35,841 --> 01:37:40,505
And he's sorry it took him so long
to realize what a mistake he made.

1448
01:37:41,781 --> 01:37:43,908
How did you...

1449
01:37:43,983 --> 01:37:48,215
Well. I had to body check an old lady.

1450
01:37:48,854 --> 01:37:52,290
Employ a taxi cab translator. Don't ask.

1451
01:37:53,927 --> 01:37:55,827
Fly 18 hours.

1452
01:37:57,898 --> 01:37:59,297
Hijack a tuk-tuk.

1453
01:38:01,101 --> 01:38:03,569
And bribe a street gypsy.

1454
01:38:04,171 --> 01:38:06,435
And I did it all in this monkey suit.

1455
01:38:06,606 --> 01:38:08,938
I kind of feel like James Bond.

1456
01:38:10,777 --> 01:38:13,940
Only I probably don't
smell as good as he does.

1457
01:38:14,748 --> 01:38:18,309
- I think you smell great.
- Thanks.

1458
01:38:28,495 --> 01:38:31,555
I couldn't get married.

1459
01:38:34,868 --> 01:38:37,599
Well. It's a pretty big deal.

1460
01:38:38,573 --> 01:38:40,473
Sort of like a platinum card.

1461
01:38:41,209 --> 01:38:45,202
Once you make that commitment.
You really have to see it through.

1462
01:38:45,913 --> 01:38:47,710
But I think I'd like that.

1463
01:38:51,152 --> 01:38:53,347
Kiss him. Kiss him.

1464
01:39:16,879 --> 01:39:18,574
You sure
this is such a good idea?

1465
01:39:18,647 --> 01:39:20,706
Don't worry. It'll be good.

1466
01:39:21,750 --> 01:39:22,876
Best of luck.

1467
01:39:27,656 --> 01:39:33,356
Sir. Before you take a swing.
There's something I want to read to you.

1468
01:39:51,813 --> 01:39:54,304
Try English. Boy. You're hurting my ears.

1469
01:39:57,486 --> 01:40:02,481
I just wanted you to know that I have the
utmost respect for you and your family.

1470
01:40:04,727 --> 01:40:09,391
And I promise to treat your daughter with
all the love and respect she deserves.

1471
01:40:20,076 --> 01:40:21,839
<i>You like alu parathas?</i>

1472
01:40:26,349 --> 01:40:28,180
<i>Let's give him alu parathas.</i>

1473
01:40:28,484 --> 01:40:29,576
Sit. Sit.

1474
01:40:40,731 --> 01:40:46,101
<i>Wise men say</i>

1475
01:40:47,171 --> 01:40:53,371
<i>Only fools rush in</i>

1476
01:40:54,979 --> 01:40:59,882
<i>But I can't help</i>

1477
01:41:00,884 --> 01:41:07,255
<i>Falling in love with you</i>

1478
01:41:09,960 --> 01:41:15,728
<i>Shall I stay</i>

1479
01:41:16,867 --> 01:41:22,500
<i>Would it be a sin?</i>

1480
01:41:24,476 --> 01:41:30,278
<i>If I can't help</i>

1481
01:41:30,348 --> 01:41:36,878
<i>Falling in love with you</i>

1482
01:41:39,357 --> 01:41:42,986
<i>Like a river flows</i>

1483
01:41:43,061 --> 01:41:46,758

01:41:46,831 --> 01:41:50,323

<i>Some things are meant to be</i>

<i>Take my hand</i>

01:42:04,350 --> 01:42:10,653
<i>Take my whole life, too</i>

01:42:12,291 --> 01:42:18,059
