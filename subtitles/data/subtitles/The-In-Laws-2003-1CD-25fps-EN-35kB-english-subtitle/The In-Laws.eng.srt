1
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:11,054
You will see that her fingerprint
matches exactly.

2
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:25,467
That's very nice. Very, very nice.

3
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:29,448
So...

4
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:31,709
...when will your buyer have the money?

5
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:33,910
He should have the money
within a week.

6
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:36,282
You will do it in four days.

7
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:39,491
Four days. That's sunday.

8
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:42,459
I've got something going on on sunday.

9
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:47,461
Sunday will be fine. I'll work out
my schedule. I'll juggle it, not to worry.

10
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:49,568
One more thing.

11
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:51,431
If i come to america with olga...

12
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:56,041
...you think you can get me tickets
to celine dion?

13
00:02:56,609 --> 00:03:00,272
I will not only get you tickets,
i will get you backstage.

14
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:03,540
And if we're really lucky,
you'll have coffee with her, okay?

15
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:08,547
Get down!

16
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:06,111
There's your guys.
See you in four days?

17
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:43,347
- How'd it go?
- Well, i had a minor snag.

18
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:29,887
Not bad.

19
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:32,998
I would've liked to gotten in
a double twist before the blowup.

20
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,435
Heads up.

21
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:42,705
- Thanks, doll-face.
- Anytime.

22
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:44,900
You got any gum?

23
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,907
Put your thumb in there.

24
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,240
So cherkasov wants
to do the deal on sunday.

25
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,611
The wedding's on sunday.

26
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:57,219
I knew that.
I wouldn't forget my only son's wedding.

27
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,187
We'll just have to juggle.

28
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:04,393
Don't think of it as a problem,
think of it as an opportunity for a solution.

29
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:11,202
- So have you met the bride's family yet?
- No, i'm a little worried about that.

30
00:06:11,437 --> 00:06:14,372
- About what?
- Well, the father. He's a doctor.

31
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:18,271
You know how they are. They think
they're better than all the rest of us.

32
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:21,208
He's probably a brain surgeon
or something.

33
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:24,282
I need you to listen
to me carefully now...

34
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:27,851
...because it's getting very, very serious.

35
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,878
All right.

36
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,991
Now, the fungus on your toes
is coming back.

37
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:37,122
Are you putting the powder in your shoes?
Are you using the cream at night?

38
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:38,285
Sometimes.

39
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:42,127
If a piano was falling on your head,
you move out of the way "sometimes"?

40
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:43,996
It's a fungus. I wasn't worried.

41
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,502
Start worrying! It doesn't hurt to worry.

42
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:48,299
Dr. Peyser, your daughter's here.

43
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:51,637
I'll be right back.

44
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,471
- Hey, daddy.
- Hi, sweetie.

45
00:06:54,647 --> 00:06:56,137
What'd you want?

46
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:59,741
The mortons are bringing
their children now.

47
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:03,345
- You know their 8-year-old, irwin?
- Yeah.

48
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:04,922
He has a shoe fetish.

49
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,719
I had them at the table
with uncle bernie and aunt thelma...

50
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:09,452
...but i think this is a problem.

51
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:12,462
- Thelma was beaten up in a shoe store.
- My god.

52
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:17,092
I don't wanna put them together. I'll move
bernie and thelma to the 12-step table.

53
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,965
Fine. Whatever you want, dad.

54
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:22,198
I just don't want you to be too anxious
about the seating chart.

55
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:25,606
No, i'm fine. I just want
the best wedding in the world, that's all.

56
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:28,770
Marc's only requirement is that
his parents are at separate tables...

57
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:31,178
...facing away from each other,
and out of earshot.

58
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:33,716
- I know.
- And his dad's coming over at 7 tonight.

59
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:37,652
- I'll believe that when i see it.
- Marc swears he'll be there this time.

60
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:41,658
- Well, i'm making a veal.
- Nice, dad.

61
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:46,191
Okay, i'll sign off on this and fax it
to the new caterer and we're done.

62
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:48,526
- The new caterer?
- Yeah, you know that.

63
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:51,067
Daddy, you fired another caterer?

64
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:56,231
They weren't caterers.
That was a man and his wife and lettuce.

65
00:07:56,409 --> 00:08:01,142
Okay. Fine. I didn't even want a caterer,
i just wanted six people and a beach, but...

66
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:05,216
melissa, this is what you want.
This is the wedding you'll remember.

67
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,214
You're right.

68
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:08,910
Thank you, dad.

69
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:10,179
Bye.

70
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,117
Get the beach out of your head,
it's overrated.

71
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:16,557
You'll be standing there in front
of an e. Coli sign.

72
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:22,358
Shit. We got a fire in number one again.
Got any halon left?

73
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:23,797
Barely.

74
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,369
We're losing altitude.

75
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:27,062
We're coming up on nova scotia.

76
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,868
- How about thibodoux?
- You're meeting his person tonight.

77
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:32,203
I can't tonight.
I've got the in-laws for dinner.

78
00:08:32,378 --> 00:08:34,073
I've blown them off three times.

79
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:36,613
I can meet with thibodoux's person.
You do the parent thing.

80
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:38,215
No. You're not ready yet.

81
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:42,452
- Always the bridesmaid, never the bride.
- Who got you into this business?

82
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:46,581
I taught you everything you know.
When you're ready, you can take the lead.

83
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:51,196
I'll figure it out tonight.
I'll just improvise.

84
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:52,920
Okay, here we go.

85
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:57,725
Mayday, mayday! Lear niner-whiskey-mike
approaching cape breton.

86
00:09:21,794 --> 00:09:24,524
And this is when melissa
went bungee jumping.

87
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:26,392
She's so crazy.

88
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:28,830
- Was that my dad?
- Nope.

89
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:31,231
Your father seems
to be working all the time.

90
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:34,936
I had no idea selling xerox machines
was so demanding.

91
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:38,008
It's a wild ride.
Yeah, but he loves it.

92
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:40,475
I have an announcement to make!

93
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:46,778
The glaze on the veal is now a laminate.
It's like a plastic jacket.

94
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:50,317
He doesn't usually cook.
He can't handle the pressure.

95
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:53,414
I'd just like to know
what day we're gonna eat.

96
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,587
He's here.

97
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,427
Here we go.

98
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:02,163
I am sorry. I am so sorry.

99
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:07,295
My apologies. Engine trouble.
Mea culpa. Mea culpa to the tenth power...

100
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:08,770
are you katherine?

101
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:12,240
Oh, my god! Marc said you were gorgeous,
but he didn't do you justice.

102
00:10:12,411 --> 00:10:14,641
- Come here. Come here.
- Well, thank you.

103
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:18,073
Hello, beautiful. How are you?

104
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:21,947
Good to see you.
Hi, buddy. Sorry, business.

105
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,521
- Is she here?
- No. She'll be at the rehearsal dinner.

106
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,021
Okay, good.

107
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:28,683
Boy, do you have a beautiful house here.

108
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:31,964
What is that, veal jerky?

109
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,691
We passed jerky about an hour ago.

110
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:38,403
This has gotta be the doctor.

111
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:40,163
- Come here.
- That's all right.

112
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:43,206
- Come here. Come on.
- No, i don't like this.

113
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:50,706
Thank you, jer. I don't need your watch.
I've already got my own right here.

114
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:53,283
What are you talking about?

115
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:57,046
How did you do that?

116
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:07,859
- I love magic tricks!
- That's wonderful.

117
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,765
Breaks the ice a little bit, huh?
Gets that party going!

118
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:15,738
All right. That's very entertaining.

119
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:18,001
Dad, does he get the watch back?

120
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:21,874
Of course! I just feel terrible about the meal,
so dinner is on me!

121
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:25,074
He who is tardy pays for the party, okay?

122
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:28,611
Jer, katherine, what do you feel like?
Ethnic food?

123
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,012
How ethnic?

124
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:39,828
This place is gonna
knock your socks off.

125
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:43,066
I'll meet you inside, okay?
Dad, can i have a second with you?

126
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,435
- At least the dog looks fresh.
- Just relax, honey.

127
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:54,306
The whole schmoozy salesman thing...

128
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,778
- yeah, how's that playing?
- Take it down a notch.

129
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:59,247
Yeah, okay, i got you. Thanks.

130
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:06,957
Good evening and welcome to quan lee.
Table for five?

131
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:10,721
- Are you full tonight?
- Expecting to be any moment, sir.

132
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:23,840
This is quan lee.
He's the owner of the place here.

133
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:32,711
Quan lee and i did some copy-related work
in vietnam together.

134
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:35,547
Katherine, why don't you sit over here.

135
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:44,953
He had a copier with a paper slot
that was choked with paper.

136
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:53,000
So i destroyed the copier.

137
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:56,031
Dad's always got great stories.

138
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:11,315
Tastes like beer,
but it's got an incredible buzz.

139
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:15,360
This guy gets around.

140
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:19,362
He's chased across prague in the morning,
has dinner with u.s. Contacts that night.

141
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:28,668
- So have you ever been to vietnam?
- No, but we hear it's lovely.

142
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:30,968
Jerry prefers to stay in one place.

143
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:34,874
He had an anxiety attack
watching an airline commercial once.

144
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:37,845
Honey, i did not have an anxiety attack.

145
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:42,545
If i remember correctly, that airline is now
out of business, so thank you very much.

146
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:47,181
Jer, i'm with you. I like to be in control.
I like to be right there in the driver's seat.

147
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:49,725
In which case,
pray you're not a passenger.

148
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:52,830
Marc doesn't like the way i drive.

149
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:56,229
Am i wrong? I look at traffic signals
sort of as a suggestion.

150
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:58,996
In that case, you would be wrong.

151
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:00,327
He would.

152
00:14:00,706 --> 00:14:02,503
- Who's that?
- Which one?

153
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,609
- The guy on the left.
- Just a sec.

154
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:12,207
You got him?

155
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,588
I've got no id.

156
00:14:17,756 --> 00:14:19,553
He could be deep cover.

157
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:21,386
Menus.

158
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:27,265
Would you like me to bring you
some arm extenders with that?

159
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:29,526
No, i'm fine, thank you. I'm just...

160
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,727
i'm stretching.

161
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:38,134
We'll have the house special, please.

162
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:39,937
Excellent.

163
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:46,908
Extra hot.
Let me check, make sure they do it right.

164
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:50,749
But whatever you bring extra hot,
bring out mild too.

165
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,115
Or eggs!

166
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:01,397
Can we hold this off
for about two hours?

167
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:05,632
I have to wire my employer
in 30 minutes.

168
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:12,768
Jer, wait till you see the special.
You are gonna flip out.

169
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:16,005
- We're very excited.
- I can't wait.

170
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:25,089
Jer, you all right?
You haven't touched your food.

171
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:27,748
My food is still eating.

172
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:30,860
- Well, i think it's time for a toast.
- Hear, hear.

173
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,328
Marc, buddy...

174
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:36,263
...seems like yesterday you
were just starting school.

175
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:39,770
What was the name of that school?

176
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,930
- Horton?
- Horton, yeah.

177
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:46,734
Sorry. I should have gotten there
a little more often.

178
00:15:46,912 --> 00:15:50,211
But look at you now,
out of law school...

179
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:55,513
...working with a brand-new firm,
about to marry this beautiful girl.

180
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:03,154
Where did the time go, man?

181
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:14,402
I gotta go to the john.

182
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:17,565
Oh, i'm sorry.

183
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:20,177
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

184
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:22,041
Cheers.

185
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:37,351
You haven't even tasted it.

186
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:40,327
Have you seen the discovery channel?
This is one of the stars.

187
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:43,325
You might as well eat
barbara walters.

188
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:48,104
I'm going to the bathroom.

189
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,408
I don't like to be kept waiting.

190
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:52,873
You know we're hot?

191
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:56,947
If we're going to do this,
we have to do it now. Take it out.

192
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:05,684
- Should i put it in?
- I'll do it.

193
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:14,524
Very well. Good old olga.

194
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:18,695
She's in good shape for a 20-year-old
runaway. Where is she exactly?

195
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,396
I'll tell you when i get the money.

196
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:26,911
Bring the proof to monsieur thibodoux.

197
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:29,104
I'll wire him now, tell him you check out.

198
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:31,476
I'm not going to france,
i just came from europe.

199
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,311
I'm barely adjusted
to the time change.

200
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:35,749
This deal has gotta go down
by sunday.

201
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:38,287
You are not serious
about brokering a deal for olga.

202
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:40,220
I'm serious...

203
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:44,823
hey, jer?

204
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:49,795
- You're not a stall-peeper, are you?
- No. No.

205
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:53,995
Because they got a website for guys like
you. I think you ought to take it online.

206
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:57,199
Actually, i dropped a quarter, and...

207
00:17:57,376 --> 00:17:59,970
- it's not in there?
- No.

208
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:03,581
I don't need it. I'm all right. Thanks.

209
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:11,288
Yeah, could i do this alone?

210
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:13,220
You're not centered.

211
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:17,522
Would you mind? It's too close for me.
I have a shy bladder.

212
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:19,125
Oh, great.

213
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:20,788
Talk to me on day six.

214
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:25,733
Jer, you still here?
Oh, you got that shy bladder thing, huh?

215
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:28,737
That's pretty common.

216
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:31,472
Buddy, you mind?
My friend is trying to take a pee.

217
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:41,142
Well, well. What do we have here?

218
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,652
- I'll come back.
- No, you stay where you are, jer.

219
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:46,416
This man's just about to leave.

220
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:49,991
Excuse me.

221
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:51,493
What is this? I mean, what...?

222
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:53,688
Next time i see a woman
in the men's room...

223
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:56,699
...l'm calling management!
Can you believe this?

224
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:58,461
Doug?

225
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:14,018
That's it, we're going home.
The wedding is off.

226
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:16,552
What? Dad, what are you talking about?

227
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:18,986
- What happened?
- He beat up a guy in the bathroom.

228
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,649
He wasn't even going to the bathroom
to begin with.

229
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:24,159
- Dad, you're going insane.
- I'm already there.

230
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,290
I got it.

231
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:32,402
An unconscious person.
You must be working.

232
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:35,267
The first thing i noticed about the guy
is he supinates.

233
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,601
- So?
- His shoes show medial heel erosion.

234
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:40,677
Only pronators have that!
Never mind, it's technical.

235
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,336
Marc is a wonderful guy.

236
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:44,545
But this is too much for me
to handle.

237
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:47,014
Fine. Don't marry marc, i will.

238
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,780
- Jerry.
- Don't "jerry" me now. Let's go.

239
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:53,083
- Oh, sweetheart...
- honey, let's go. Let's go. Now.

240
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:54,953
Mom!

241
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:56,652
I tried to push this...

242
00:19:56,828 --> 00:19:59,888
it's bad enough you screwed up your life.
I won't let you screw up mine.

243
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:01,532
I'll make this up to you.

244
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:06,194
No, no, no! You listen.
Don't apologize to me, apologize to them.

245
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:11,100
You fix this. You fix this.

246
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,970
Okay. I hear you.

247
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:18,339
I'm sorry about my father.

248
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:20,781
Honey, i'm sorry about my father.

249
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:23,114
- Here.
- Thanks.

250
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:24,880
- I have an idea.
- Yeah?

251
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:30,120
Let's you and me leave town immediately.
Let's escape our wedding.

252
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:32,286
There's no escaping.

253
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:34,557
- Really?
- Really.

254
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:37,327
Isn't this supposed to be about us?

255
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:43,805
Sweet, funny, whimsical melissa.
Weddings aren't about the bride and groom.

256
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:56,251
- There he is! He's inside! Let's move!
- Go!

257
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:09,691
Get that out!

258
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:13,395
Some doctors like to operate...

259
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:17,338
...but i believe in exhausting all
non-surgical techniques first.

260
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:20,535
This gentleman, however,
will need surgery.

261
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:23,545
- What?
- I'm sorry. That's my fault.

262
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:26,343
I should've told you that privately.
It slipped out.

263
00:21:26,518 --> 00:21:29,180
It's not a big deal.
At worst, you'd lose a toe.

264
00:21:29,354 --> 00:21:31,686
- Oh, my god.
- It rarely happens.

265
00:21:37,362 --> 00:21:40,456
All right, gorgeous, you arrange
for the plane. I'll be right back.

266
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:44,898
Are you sure about this? We've got
the fbi on us like trailer trash on velveeta.

267
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:50,431
Yeah. No, i promised marc.
Besides, i owe the guy an apology.

268
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:12,994
Okay, guys,
let's try and keep a low profile.

269
00:22:30,582 --> 00:22:33,710
Since we're talking
about the sesamoid bones...

270
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:37,616
...let's see their role in the deformity
anatomically known as...

271
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:42,419
...hallux abducto valgus, or what?
The...?

272
00:22:42,594 --> 00:22:44,084
The bunion.

273
00:22:44,262 --> 00:22:47,390
The bunion...
what? What are you doing here?

274
00:22:47,566 --> 00:22:50,763
Listen to you.
You're mr. Medical authority.

275
00:22:50,936 --> 00:22:54,269
I asked you on the phone not to come here.
I don't want to see you again.

276
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:58,699
I just wanted to apologize and make sure
that you don't have any problem with me...

277
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:02,779
...that would interfere with the wedding.
- There's not gonna be a wedding.

278
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:07,211
- Would you like us to step outside, sir?
- No, i wouldn't.

279
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:12,647
Do you know what a remarkable teacher
you have here?

280
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:17,955
This man was chosen chicago's podiatrist
of the year three years in a row!

281
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:20,428
So let's give him a hand, huh?

282
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:26,170
Would you please leave right now?

283
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:29,796
Five minutes, a cup of coffee.
I just want to iron out a couple of things.

284
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:32,671
If i give you five minutes,
will you leave me alone forever?

285
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:35,210
Of course i will.

286
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:40,977
I need five minutes. All right?
Just relax. I'll be right back.

287
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,646
Thank you.

288
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:44,413
This is where i work.

289
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:47,888
I don't bother you when you're
in the bathroom with your hookers.

290
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:52,621
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, please. Olga, the 20-year-old runaway.

291
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:57,132
What are you doing?
No more magic tricks! Thank you.

292
00:23:57,302 --> 00:23:59,770
- What happened? What is that?
- You! Freeze!

293
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,762
What?

294
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,165
- What happened?
- I said, freeze!

295
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:07,609
How'd it go?

296
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,846
Patch things up with the family?

297
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,640
Well, not really.

298
00:24:13,018 --> 00:24:14,485
Come on.

299
00:24:17,155 --> 00:24:19,089
Watch your head, sir.

300
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:28,633
You took my picture?

301
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:31,701
Jerome allen peyser,
200 rector place.

302
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:36,239
Subject was apprehended in possession
of 9.4 milliliters of fissile nuclear waste.

303
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:39,005
- Fissile what?
- Yeah, right.

304
00:24:39,177 --> 00:24:41,702
Next you'll tell me
you've never heard of olga.

305
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,007
The 20-year-old runaway.

306
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:48,181
Hey, i don't know what that means.
I overheard it!

307
00:24:48,353 --> 00:24:51,322
Listen, i'm a foot doctor.

308
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:55,893
- I want a name. What's your name?
- Hutchins. Now i get to ask a question.

309
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:58,154
Where'd you get that canister from,
this man?

310
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:20,751
That's him!

311
00:25:21,253 --> 00:25:23,244
That's the guy who i got it from!

312
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:25,218
The homeless guy? Great.

313
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:28,684
- An arms dealer and a smart-ass.
- Arms dealer?

314
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,021
- What happened to pimp?
- Fine. You're a pimp.

315
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:34,563
- No, i'm nothing! It's him!
- Who?

316
00:25:36,668 --> 00:25:38,761
The meter maid is the hostess!

317
00:25:39,604 --> 00:25:42,767
- Nobody is who they are.
- Sounds like you're tripping on drugs, pal.

318
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:46,440
Look, he's talking to me!

319
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:50,639
Hi, there.

320
00:26:11,536 --> 00:26:13,800
- I think i breathed a little!
- Don't be such a pussy.

321
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:18,341
Don't call me a pussy! You just made me
radioactive with your fissile nuclear waste!

322
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:21,001
Bet you never said that
sentence before, jer.

323
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:24,239
- I don't even know what it means!
- Some things you shouldn't know.

324
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:25,781
You probably gave me leukemia!

325
00:26:25,951 --> 00:26:27,942
Oh, you're gonna be fine.
Now, hop in.

326
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:30,587
I'm not hopping anywhere with you.

327
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:34,156
Jer, we are family. And don't make
me do something i don't wanna do.

328
00:26:34,326 --> 00:26:36,021
We're not family.
There's not gonna be...

329
00:26:37,162 --> 00:26:39,027
i'm going! I'm going!

330
00:26:39,197 --> 00:26:40,255
Now, you hold on tight.

331
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,992
It's a cushman.
It goes 5 miles an hour.

332
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:44,635
Not this one.

333
00:26:46,671 --> 00:26:48,002
All right, slow down!

334
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,964
Listen, while i got you here...

335
00:26:50,141 --> 00:26:53,474
...i wanted to tell you i'm so sorry
i had to drag you through all this.

336
00:26:53,645 --> 00:26:55,636
All right, there's a car!

337
00:26:57,148 --> 00:26:58,706
Okay, wait a minute!

338
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:04,550
- Is that a fanny pack?
- Yes.

339
00:27:06,491 --> 00:27:08,322
What's so funny?

340
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:11,488
There's a taxi! Oh, my god, a taxi!

341
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:15,826
This isn't funny. There's a girl!

342
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:21,467
Ostop this! Stop the little thing!

343
00:27:23,241 --> 00:27:25,471
Jer, i'm worried about you.

344
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:29,375
You just don't look good.
Let me get you a glass of water.

345
00:27:29,547 --> 00:27:32,573
What's the plane situation?
Will i make it to thibodoux's in time?

346
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:35,117
It shouldn't be a problem.
You have tailwinds.

347
00:27:35,286 --> 00:27:36,947
He's expecting you at 3.

348
00:27:37,122 --> 00:27:40,319
- You want me with you, i can rejig.
- Here you go. No, i need you here.

349
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:43,222
I wanna make sure cherkasov is okay
with the chicago drop.

350
00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:46,228
Jer. Jer. Don't go there, jer.

351
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:47,888
Jer.

352
00:27:51,736 --> 00:27:54,534
You're really gonna have
to work on your listening skills.

353
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,475
Mr. Xerox.

354
00:27:57,642 --> 00:28:00,236
Well, a great supply of copiers
you have here.

355
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:03,404
I like the one shaped like a rocket launcher.
Does it collate?

356
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:05,511
Is that a fanny pack?

357
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:07,675
- It's cute, isn't it?
- It's adorable.

358
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:11,413
Yeah, it's a fanny pack. I'm a doctor,
something you know nothing about.

359
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:13,216
I'm riveted. Go on.

360
00:28:14,225 --> 00:28:15,920
I have a phone in here and a pager...

361
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:18,688
...and some lorna doones,
in case i get hungry.

362
00:28:18,963 --> 00:28:21,557
And i also have
a personal attack alarm...

363
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:24,566
...and if you come near me again,
i'm gonna use it!

364
00:28:26,137 --> 00:28:28,196
She hit me!

365
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:30,469
Did you like it?

366
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:34,237
What is wrong with you?
Something's really wrong.

367
00:28:34,412 --> 00:28:38,974
So just tell me what you are. A smuggler?
A pimp? You deal in russian runaways?

368
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:42,711
Yeah, we're all those things and more.
We are deep undercover.

369
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:46,148
We're the cia.

370
00:28:46,524 --> 00:28:47,957
Great.

371
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:49,889
Now we have to kill him.

372
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:52,427
- Oh, ange, enough already.
- Fine.

373
00:28:52,797 --> 00:28:55,925
I'm gonna go salvage what's left
of my personal life.

374
00:28:58,937 --> 00:29:01,872
- I don't believe anything you're saying.
- It's better that way.

375
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,838
The one thing you should know
is that we are the good guys.

376
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:07,671
Okay. Look, i didn't see anything.
I'll never tell a soul.

377
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:10,974
- So take me home and i'm done.
- We'll talk about it on the plane.

378
00:29:11,282 --> 00:29:13,079
I don't fly. There's no plane.

379
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:17,017
Doctor, do you know what a roofie is?

380
00:29:17,188 --> 00:29:20,954
Yeah, i know what a roofie is.
Frat boys give them to girls at parties.

381
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:26,620
Oh, no, no.

382
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:30,298
Oh, don't rape me.

383
00:29:58,477 --> 00:30:00,308
Hello?

384
00:30:17,296 --> 00:30:19,093
Hey, jer.

385
00:30:19,365 --> 00:30:20,992
We're on a plane!

386
00:30:21,167 --> 00:30:24,159
Yes, we are. And you're
doing quite well, i might add.

387
00:30:24,337 --> 00:30:26,362
I'm making myself an omelet.
You hungry?

388
00:30:26,539 --> 00:30:27,631
I feel sick.

389
00:30:27,807 --> 00:30:30,275
How did that stuff work out
that i put in your drink?

390
00:30:30,443 --> 00:30:31,671
Gives you a hell of a kick.

391
00:30:31,944 --> 00:30:34,310
People say they wake up so refreshed.

392
00:30:34,513 --> 00:30:36,378
You gave me a roofie.

393
00:30:37,316 --> 00:30:40,808
- There's nobody flying!
- No, gulfstream 5, top of the line.

394
00:30:40,987 --> 00:30:42,249
This baby flies itself.

395
00:30:42,922 --> 00:30:46,653
This one, i think,
belongs to barbra streisand.

396
00:30:46,826 --> 00:30:50,159
- What kind of omelet fillings you want?
- You stole barbra streisand's plane?

397
00:30:50,329 --> 00:30:53,560
I borrowed it. It's not like we're going
to the bahamas or anything.

398
00:30:53,766 --> 00:30:56,132
I mean, this is official business.

399
00:30:57,003 --> 00:30:59,733
- I'm gonna throw up.
- Bathroom's right behind me.

400
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:05,071
I'm really proud of you, jer. I think
you really conquered this flying thing.

401
00:31:05,244 --> 00:31:06,404
You're my hero.

402
00:31:42,248 --> 00:31:44,944
You have dialed
an invalid country code.

403
00:31:45,151 --> 00:31:48,245
Okay, marc is such a wonderful guy.

404
00:31:49,922 --> 00:31:53,585
And you are so lucky.

405
00:31:54,794 --> 00:31:57,160
I'm gonna get so drunk.

406
00:32:09,742 --> 00:32:13,269
I'm totally fine.
I fall all the time, you guys.

407
00:32:13,446 --> 00:32:14,845
I fall every day.

408
00:32:16,315 --> 00:32:18,579
- Marc?
- Melissa, it's your father!

409
00:32:18,751 --> 00:32:20,446
- Dad?
- Honey.

410
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,847
Dad, i can't hear anything.
You're breaking up.

411
00:32:23,022 --> 00:32:24,387
I can't hear anything.

412
00:32:24,557 --> 00:32:26,957
- Jerry?
- Katherine!

413
00:32:27,126 --> 00:32:30,926
I am in the bathroom
of barbra streisand's airplane.

414
00:32:31,097 --> 00:32:33,327
Steve is taking me to france!

415
00:32:33,632 --> 00:32:36,726
Honey, your father's going to france
with barbra streisand!

416
00:32:36,902 --> 00:32:38,494
What?!

417
00:32:38,671 --> 00:32:40,969
Babs! Babs!

418
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:43,472
I'm not going to france
with barbra streisand!

419
00:32:43,642 --> 00:32:45,701
So, what's she like? Is she nice?

420
00:32:45,878 --> 00:32:47,140
She's not here!

421
00:32:47,313 --> 00:32:48,746
I love barbra streisand.

422
00:32:48,948 --> 00:32:52,042
- They're taking me against my will!
- This doesn't make any sense.

423
00:32:52,218 --> 00:32:55,449
These things don't have to make sense,
katherine. Call everyone.

424
00:32:55,621 --> 00:32:57,020
All the authorities!

425
00:32:57,189 --> 00:32:58,486
Do it now!

426
00:32:58,657 --> 00:33:01,217
Is melissa okay?
She said something to me in the office.

427
00:33:01,393 --> 00:33:04,191
I'm worried about her.
Put her back on the phone!

428
00:33:04,864 --> 00:33:06,024
Jerry?

429
00:33:06,899 --> 00:33:09,026
- Yeah?
- Hey, jer, you fall in?

430
00:33:09,268 --> 00:33:10,735
Yeah, i did. I fell in.

431
00:33:11,103 --> 00:33:12,695
I'll be out in a minute.

432
00:33:14,473 --> 00:33:15,462
Hello?

433
00:33:15,941 --> 00:33:18,967
Mom, can you come here for a minute?

434
00:33:22,748 --> 00:33:25,683
Oh, no. This is about the tax return,
isn't it?

435
00:33:33,259 --> 00:33:35,352
You ever been to france, jer?

436
00:33:35,661 --> 00:33:36,719
No.

437
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:40,555
I think we're flying way too low.

438
00:33:41,267 --> 00:33:44,998
Well, we gotta stay under the radar.
It makes things a little less complicated.

439
00:33:45,171 --> 00:33:47,036
Yeah, but this is just too low.

440
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:51,406
Let me tell you about this guy we're gonna
see. His name is jean-pierre thibodoux.

441
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:55,068
Now, he is a smuggler of the worst kind.
But not to worry, all right?

442
00:33:55,247 --> 00:33:57,112
We're just going in and out.

443
00:33:57,283 --> 00:33:59,080
Gotta pick up $ 170 million.

444
00:33:59,251 --> 00:34:04,120
Hopefully broker a deal where i can bust
both the buyer and seller, put them in jail.

445
00:34:04,356 --> 00:34:06,916
You're getting $ 170 million?

446
00:34:07,092 --> 00:34:10,186
Yeah. It's chump change for a guy
like that. Once he's got olga...

447
00:34:10,362 --> 00:34:13,763
...he can control the black market
in the u.s., russia and the middle east.

448
00:34:14,033 --> 00:34:16,024
So everybody wants this olga.

449
00:34:16,702 --> 00:34:19,398
Oh, my god. Oh, no.
What's this shaking?

450
00:34:19,572 --> 00:34:21,699
What is that? That's too much!

451
00:34:21,874 --> 00:34:22,863
Oh, jer...

452
00:34:23,275 --> 00:34:25,607
...do you know anything
about flying a g5?

453
00:34:25,778 --> 00:34:27,075
That's not funny!

454
00:34:27,246 --> 00:34:30,374
I'm serious, jer.
There's something wrong here.

455
00:34:32,284 --> 00:34:34,718
What are you doing?
Why are you banging that?

456
00:34:34,887 --> 00:34:37,412
Do you know how you put
the landing gear down in this?

457
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:42,220
You don't know where the landing gear is?
How can you not know that?!

458
00:34:43,829 --> 00:34:47,094
I got you so good, didn't i, jer?

459
00:34:49,435 --> 00:34:50,424
You son of a...

460
00:34:56,208 --> 00:34:59,473
my husband couldn't possibly
be buying a...

461
00:34:59,745 --> 00:35:02,646
- could you please repeat that?
- A stealth nuclear submarine.

462
00:35:02,848 --> 00:35:06,511
Missing since 1998. the commander
of the fleet, one alexei cherkasov...

463
00:35:06,752 --> 00:35:10,586
...now a kingpin with the russian mob,
has been selling stolen military equipment.

464
00:35:11,156 --> 00:35:13,716
This is his big-ticket item.
And we found a sample...

465
00:35:13,893 --> 00:35:16,828
...of her fissile nuclear waste
in your husband's possession.

466
00:35:16,996 --> 00:35:18,588
Fissile nuclear what?

467
00:35:18,931 --> 00:35:21,297
Each submarine emits
a kind of radioactive waste...

468
00:35:21,467 --> 00:35:25,096
...which bears a unique imprint to that
particular sub. A proof of possession.

469
00:35:25,404 --> 00:35:27,895
You guys,
my dad wouldn't buy a russian sub.

470
00:35:28,073 --> 00:35:29,938
I mean,
he won't even buy a foreign car.

471
00:35:30,376 --> 00:35:32,173
Place is clean.

472
00:35:32,344 --> 00:35:34,107
Thank you.

473
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,872
We'll be in touch.

474
00:35:36,749 --> 00:35:38,512
Guys, let's go.

475
00:35:40,152 --> 00:35:42,620
When i opened the door,
i thought they were strippers.

476
00:35:45,891 --> 00:35:48,451
So i'm in france because
of submarine piss.

477
00:35:48,627 --> 00:35:49,889
Yeah, it's nutty, isn't it?

478
00:35:50,062 --> 00:35:52,155
Think what you'll
tell your grandchildren.

479
00:35:52,331 --> 00:35:55,926
Of course, you're gonna be sworn
to secrecy, so you won't be able to, but...

480
00:35:57,569 --> 00:35:59,434
who are these guys?

481
00:36:00,306 --> 00:36:03,241
Hi, how are you? Nice hair.

482
00:36:04,443 --> 00:36:06,536
I don't understand something!

483
00:36:06,712 --> 00:36:08,202
Why would a smuggler want a...?

484
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:12,714
Large, armed,
virtually undetectable transport vehicle?

485
00:36:13,585 --> 00:36:15,052
Right.

486
00:36:15,321 --> 00:36:17,846
So he moves drugs, munitions,
everything.

487
00:36:18,023 --> 00:36:21,481
World falls apart,
this guy makes a fortune.

488
00:36:36,241 --> 00:36:37,799
I see a lot of guns.

489
00:36:37,977 --> 00:36:40,741
Did you ever think it's because
you want to see the guns?

490
00:36:40,913 --> 00:36:45,111
I mean, i look around,
i see birds, flowers, beautiful girls.

491
00:36:45,284 --> 00:36:47,309
The cup is half-full.

492
00:36:47,486 --> 00:36:51,320
You know, you gotta stop,
smell the roses.

493
00:36:51,857 --> 00:36:53,347
Arms up.

494
00:36:56,061 --> 00:37:00,589
Please be careful. I have very
sensitive underarms. I just don't...

495
00:37:00,766 --> 00:37:03,530
i'm not kidding.
Don't do that, please. Please!

496
00:37:09,775 --> 00:37:11,208
Fanny pack?

497
00:37:16,281 --> 00:37:19,216
By the way, this fanny pack comes
from france.

498
00:37:27,826 --> 00:37:29,225
Take a good look, boys.

499
00:37:29,395 --> 00:37:32,728
I've been known to shoot tranq darts
from my knees.

500
00:37:38,604 --> 00:37:40,231
Look at you.

501
00:37:40,406 --> 00:37:42,931
You're just an old guy pretending
to be a little kid.

502
00:37:43,409 --> 00:37:44,398
Knee brace.

503
00:37:44,777 --> 00:37:47,337
The brace is for getting through
metal detectors.

504
00:37:47,513 --> 00:37:50,607
Distracts them from the knife
in my shoe.

505
00:37:50,916 --> 00:37:51,974
Steven!

506
00:37:55,254 --> 00:37:57,779
Jean-pierre.
Come on.

507
00:38:00,059 --> 00:38:02,118
One little thing i almost forgot.

508
00:38:02,294 --> 00:38:04,888
I've been known to travel
with some dangerous types...

509
00:38:05,064 --> 00:38:08,261
...so he might think that you're
an arms dealer or a deadly assassin.

510
00:38:08,434 --> 00:38:10,698
- So you just play along with it, okay?
- What?

511
00:38:10,869 --> 00:38:12,860
Just play along at being a deadly...

512
00:38:13,038 --> 00:38:15,598
silent, but deadly.

513
00:38:25,751 --> 00:38:27,184
We must hold our introduction.

514
00:38:27,486 --> 00:38:30,319
Please, gentlemen, walk with me.

515
00:38:40,933 --> 00:38:44,232
This man was caught stealing from me.

516
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:47,905
Were this one year ago,
i would torture him to death.

517
00:38:48,073 --> 00:38:50,940
But i have made some personal growth.
You notice it, right?

518
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:53,078
I noticed right off the bat,
jean-pierre.

519
00:38:53,345 --> 00:38:57,281
Well, i'm calmer now. I am more centered.
I spent some time with deepak chopra.

520
00:38:57,449 --> 00:39:01,681
He wrote molecules of emotion and
natural healing for anxiety and depression.

521
00:39:02,321 --> 00:39:05,154
I have learned how to forgive.

522
00:39:22,341 --> 00:39:24,536
Run for your life!

523
00:39:43,328 --> 00:39:47,196
- I know i need to do more work on myself.
- You're doing great, j.p.

524
00:39:47,366 --> 00:39:49,129
I did not get your name.

525
00:39:49,301 --> 00:39:50,962
Jerry.

526
00:39:52,371 --> 00:39:54,362
- You don't know who this guy is?
- No.

527
00:39:57,809 --> 00:39:59,902
The fat cobra.

528
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:06,447
Well, i am honored.

529
00:40:08,687 --> 00:40:10,917
I hope we shall get
to know each other better.

530
00:40:16,328 --> 00:40:18,023
Follow me.

531
00:40:19,731 --> 00:40:21,494
Exactly who am i?

532
00:40:21,667 --> 00:40:25,831
A legendary crime leader known only
as the fat cobra.

533
00:40:26,004 --> 00:40:27,767
Fat cobra?

534
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:32,673
So, what does that refer to?
A snake? Slithery? Venomous? What?

535
00:40:32,844 --> 00:40:36,541
No, not exactly. It refers to...

536
00:40:38,617 --> 00:40:42,314
oh. Shit.

537
00:40:53,265 --> 00:40:56,359
Your contact will meet the seller
in chicago on sunday.

538
00:40:56,535 --> 00:41:00,164
- Then he'll give him olga's location.
- It was nova scotia on wednesday.

539
00:41:00,405 --> 00:41:03,272
It's chicago on sunday.
What do you want from me?

540
00:41:03,609 --> 00:41:05,736
I'm the middleman here.

541
00:41:11,883 --> 00:41:15,375
One hundred and seventy
in cash and bearer bonds.

542
00:41:15,554 --> 00:41:18,182
But i don't hand over cash
before seeing the merchandise.

543
00:41:18,357 --> 00:41:21,554
J.p., who gave you the rocket launchers
last month on credit?

544
00:41:21,727 --> 00:41:25,094
How long have we known each other?
Years.

545
00:41:26,431 --> 00:41:28,422
All right, i trust you.

546
00:41:28,867 --> 00:41:30,698
Besides, if you try to screw me...

547
00:41:30,869 --> 00:41:33,770
...i will kill you
and everyone you've ever met.

548
00:41:39,177 --> 00:41:40,906
That's great, huh? That's great...

549
00:41:41,079 --> 00:41:42,103
shit, that knee.

550
00:41:42,281 --> 00:41:44,044
Wanna wait while i count the money...

551
00:41:44,216 --> 00:41:45,979
...or take a walk?
- We'll wait here.

552
00:41:46,151 --> 00:41:51,885
No! I would love nothing more than to
share a drink with the legendary fat cobra.

553
00:42:29,995 --> 00:42:33,260
Those mosquitoes are bad
this time of year.

554
00:42:53,552 --> 00:42:56,749
So you're buying a submarine.
Well, that'll be nice.

555
00:42:56,922 --> 00:43:00,858
Wonderful.
Now i can take anything anywhere.

556
00:43:01,026 --> 00:43:05,463
Cocaine, nuclear devices.
Whatever you want, i will move it.

557
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:07,564
That's terrific.

558
00:43:08,133 --> 00:43:10,931
We just got another town car.

559
00:43:11,436 --> 00:43:13,734
- Please make yourself comfortable.
- Okay.

560
00:43:13,905 --> 00:43:16,567
We're gonna lay here together.

561
00:43:26,318 --> 00:43:27,945
Thank you.

562
00:43:28,854 --> 00:43:30,321
To fat cobra...

563
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:33,455
...in the flesh.

564
00:43:50,308 --> 00:43:52,037
So tell me...

565
00:43:52,744 --> 00:43:56,145
...how many kills do you have?
- Kills?

566
00:43:58,683 --> 00:44:01,049
- Six.
- Six only?

567
00:44:01,453 --> 00:44:03,284
Since christmas.

568
00:44:05,490 --> 00:44:07,549
People think we are insane.

569
00:44:08,827 --> 00:44:13,389
They don't know the joy of holding a man's
beating heart in the palm of your hand.

570
00:44:13,565 --> 00:44:15,795
That's a good feeling.

571
00:44:17,502 --> 00:44:22,371
- Let's take a walk.
- No, i walked too much today.

572
00:44:22,808 --> 00:44:26,938
Besides, i have a little pain
here behind my ankle.

573
00:44:27,112 --> 00:44:29,706
- Let me take a look at it.
- What do you mean?

574
00:44:30,382 --> 00:44:32,373
I'm a foot person.

575
00:44:32,551 --> 00:44:34,416
Just like me.

576
00:44:34,986 --> 00:44:38,513
All right, tell me something here.
Is it tender right there?

577
00:44:38,690 --> 00:44:40,055
Yes!

578
00:44:41,626 --> 00:44:44,686
You have plantar fasciitis
in the heel.

579
00:44:44,863 --> 00:44:46,353
You should go soak that.

580
00:44:47,332 --> 00:44:49,027
Did you say "soak"?

581
00:45:31,810 --> 00:45:34,370
I didn't mean soak the whole body.

582
00:45:34,646 --> 00:45:38,138
I'll grab a bathing suit.
Which would you like, american or french?

583
00:45:39,251 --> 00:45:40,479
Soviet.

584
00:45:42,187 --> 00:45:44,280
I'll be right back.

585
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:51,094
I'm going to kill you! Kill you!

586
00:45:51,263 --> 00:45:54,494
That's great! Great, jerry.
You're getting into character.

587
00:45:54,666 --> 00:45:57,226
I gotta get his client list
and see what he's smuggling...

588
00:45:57,402 --> 00:46:00,166
...and where it's traveling,
so keep him looking the other way!

589
00:46:00,338 --> 00:46:03,671
Did you hear what he's calling me?
Did you hear that? Fat cobra!

590
00:46:08,747 --> 00:46:10,214
Listen...

591
00:46:10,382 --> 00:46:11,974
...i have to talk to you.

592
00:46:12,150 --> 00:46:13,617
Hey!

593
00:46:15,854 --> 00:46:18,015
I can't go in with you,
but i'm happy to watch.

594
00:46:18,189 --> 00:46:21,590
- Why?
- I have, like, a childhood problem.

595
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,456
A disease. Sort of rare.

596
00:46:25,797 --> 00:46:29,790
I'm not waterproof.
My skin will let in water.

597
00:46:29,968 --> 00:46:33,699
So i can't be in a situation where...

598
00:46:33,872 --> 00:46:37,000
...i submerse myself.

599
00:46:37,175 --> 00:46:40,633
So as a child, i couldn't do anything.
I couldn't even play with a hose.

600
00:46:40,979 --> 00:46:43,539
- You know, the slip 'n slides?
- Yes.

601
00:46:43,715 --> 00:46:45,239
I couldn't have that.

602
00:46:45,417 --> 00:46:47,817
And even snow cones.

603
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:52,453
Anyway, if i got in there and
it happened, then i could really get sick.

604
00:46:52,958 --> 00:46:56,086
What would happen is the water
goes all the way through the skin...

605
00:46:56,261 --> 00:47:00,664
...because i got what they...
well, they call "wet bone."

606
00:47:03,201 --> 00:47:05,999
I'm curious to know more
about wet bone.

607
00:47:09,007 --> 00:47:11,032
Well, the money's all there, huh?

608
00:47:11,209 --> 00:47:15,202
You okay?
You're looking a little dizzy.

609
00:47:21,519 --> 00:47:22,986
I'm married.

610
00:47:23,154 --> 00:47:25,748
- You're married?
- Yeah, i'm married.

611
00:47:26,591 --> 00:47:29,059
Well, actually, we're separated.

612
00:47:31,863 --> 00:47:33,330
Okay, i killed her.

613
00:47:36,034 --> 00:47:38,730
Well, my wife is still
very much alive.

614
00:47:39,504 --> 00:47:41,836
It's very nice to have a wife.

615
00:47:42,207 --> 00:47:45,370
But as a man, there are certain things
i can only do with other men.

616
00:47:46,144 --> 00:47:48,874
- Like golf?
- No, i'm not gay.

617
00:47:49,047 --> 00:47:54,110
It's just occasionally i need the company
of a man.

618
00:47:54,653 --> 00:47:58,145
Just because i'm big,
it doesn't mean i'm easy.

619
00:48:04,396 --> 00:48:06,091
Wow!

620
00:48:06,264 --> 00:48:09,461
I don't want to interrupt.
Just wanted to tell you the money's good...

621
00:48:09,634 --> 00:48:12,899
...i talked to the supplier,
and he'll be there sunday.

622
00:48:13,772 --> 00:48:16,172
- Would you guys like me to go?
- No, we're done.

623
00:48:16,341 --> 00:48:19,367
That was a good soak,
and i thank you very much.

624
00:48:36,761 --> 00:48:39,252
The international operator.
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

625
00:48:39,464 --> 00:48:41,694
Could you hold, please?

626
00:48:41,866 --> 00:48:43,493
Excuse me!

627
00:48:45,136 --> 00:48:46,467
Peyser is on line one.

628
00:48:46,638 --> 00:48:49,869
He's crazed. Something about
steve tobias and the fat cobra.

629
00:48:50,041 --> 00:48:51,941
- Mr. Peyser?
- It's dr. Peyser!

630
00:48:52,110 --> 00:48:54,271
You are in trouble.
Where you calling from?

631
00:48:54,446 --> 00:48:56,539
How can i be in trouble?
I didn't do anything.

632
00:48:56,715 --> 00:48:59,809
Steve tobias gave me
that fissile waste!

633
00:48:59,984 --> 00:49:02,316
- Did you say steve tobias?
- Yes.

634
00:49:02,587 --> 00:49:05,647
- He's one of you guys, right?
- Mr. Peyser, this is the fbi.

635
00:49:05,824 --> 00:49:08,952
Tobias was with the cia, but he was let go.
He's a rogue agent.

636
00:49:09,127 --> 00:49:10,856
- What does that mean?
- He went bad.

637
00:49:11,029 --> 00:49:14,294
He's mentally unstable and dangerous.
What's this about the fat cobra?

638
00:49:14,466 --> 00:49:16,263
Please, i'm innocent.

639
00:49:16,434 --> 00:49:20,666
Why don't you come tonight. We'll be
in chicago at 8:00 at the marriott marquis.

640
00:49:20,839 --> 00:49:23,706
We're in the eleanor roosevelt
function room.

641
00:49:23,875 --> 00:49:27,003
There's no eleanor roosevelt function room
at that hotel.

642
00:49:27,178 --> 00:49:29,578
One of the roosevelts!

643
00:49:31,082 --> 00:49:34,210
- Who you talking to?
- Just an operator. Nobody.

644
00:49:37,756 --> 00:49:39,553
Are you lying to me, jer?

645
00:49:39,724 --> 00:49:42,022
That will upset me.
You don't want to upset me.

646
00:49:42,193 --> 00:49:43,387
No, no. No, i don't.

647
00:49:44,896 --> 00:49:47,831
Good. So let's get going, huh?

648
00:49:47,999 --> 00:49:52,834
Last one to the plane's gonna take
170 mil through customs.

649
00:49:53,271 --> 00:49:55,796
Look, i'm used to dealing
with dr. Peyser, okay?

650
00:49:55,974 --> 00:49:59,171
- What do you have to do with this affair?
- Nothing. I'm the bride.

651
00:49:59,344 --> 00:50:02,905
Congratulations. Now, what do you want
me to do with the spray of freesia?

652
00:50:03,081 --> 00:50:06,346
Hey, buddy, i'll show you where you
can put the spray of freesia, okay?

653
00:50:06,518 --> 00:50:07,746
Okay.

654
00:50:07,919 --> 00:50:11,548
Gloria, what did you do with the
table-card seat-assignment thingies?

655
00:50:11,723 --> 00:50:13,782
What thingies? I'm a little muzzy.

656
00:50:13,958 --> 00:50:17,086
I think the devil's playing drums
in my head.

657
00:50:17,462 --> 00:50:19,487
That better be my dad.

658
00:50:20,198 --> 00:50:22,132
- "Streisand. Private."
- That would be me.

659
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:23,858
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

660
00:50:24,035 --> 00:50:26,697
Where are you?
Melissa's just really freaking out.

661
00:50:26,871 --> 00:50:29,669
And her dad's not even here,
and he planned the whole thing.

662
00:50:29,841 --> 00:50:32,401
No, he's right here. He's fine.

663
00:50:32,577 --> 00:50:35,603
Listen, buddy, i wanna give you
the heads up on something.

664
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:38,613
We've changed the location
of the rehearsal dinner.

665
00:50:38,783 --> 00:50:40,842
We're gonna meet you
at the signature room...

666
00:50:41,019 --> 00:50:43,180
...at the hancock tower instead
of the marriott.

667
00:50:43,521 --> 00:50:45,386
You moved the rehearsal dinner?

668
00:50:45,557 --> 00:50:49,118
Well, the hancock tower owed us
a favor and they'll set us up really nice.

669
00:50:49,294 --> 00:50:53,025
So if you get there before i do and
there's any kind of problem, ask for artie.

670
00:50:53,198 --> 00:50:56,463
Reference the alabaster incident.
He'll know what you're talking about.

671
00:50:56,634 --> 00:50:57,862
Oh, my god.

672
00:50:58,036 --> 00:51:00,596
I'm sorry about this, buddy,
but it's important.

673
00:51:00,772 --> 00:51:01,966
And this isn't?

674
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:05,234
You gotta trust me on this, all right?
Have i ever let you down?

675
00:51:05,410 --> 00:51:06,968
Well, as a matter of fact...

676
00:51:07,145 --> 00:51:08,942
don't answer that.

677
00:51:10,014 --> 00:51:12,141
I'll make it up to you.

678
00:51:13,151 --> 00:51:18,214
What was the name of that song you guys
sang at that karaoke club on your first date?

679
00:51:18,857 --> 00:51:20,324
What?

680
00:51:21,292 --> 00:51:24,750
"Get down tonight"
by kc and the sunshine band. Why?

681
00:51:24,929 --> 00:51:27,261
I was just curious.

682
00:51:27,432 --> 00:51:30,595
- I'll talk to you later.
- Super.

683
00:51:30,768 --> 00:51:31,894
Oh, my god.

684
00:51:38,576 --> 00:51:41,374
So you went and called the fbi.

685
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:44,077
I know all about you now.

686
00:51:44,249 --> 00:51:47,184
You're a liar.
You lie about everything.

687
00:51:47,352 --> 00:51:50,116
I did not lie to you, jer.

688
00:51:50,288 --> 00:51:52,415
I do not lie to family.

689
00:51:52,590 --> 00:51:56,287
Don't call me family!
We're not family!

690
00:52:01,633 --> 00:52:03,533
- He did what?
- It's fine.

691
00:52:03,701 --> 00:52:05,566
He switches things around sometimes...

692
00:52:05,737 --> 00:52:07,534
how could he just go and do that?

693
00:52:07,705 --> 00:52:09,798
Because he's steve tobias.

694
00:52:09,974 --> 00:52:12,534
And steve tobias is
an emotional fascist.

695
00:52:13,011 --> 00:52:15,343
But i'd like to say something.

696
00:52:15,513 --> 00:52:17,743
Just because i hate marc's father...

697
00:52:17,916 --> 00:52:21,613
...it's not going to be uncomfortable here
at the wedding.

698
00:52:21,786 --> 00:52:23,686
- Hello, everyone!
- Hi, mom.

699
00:52:23,855 --> 00:52:27,347
Hi, honey.
I'm so happy to be here.

700
00:52:27,525 --> 00:52:29,755
And i'm so proud of you.

701
00:52:31,195 --> 00:52:35,461
And finally,
the daughter i never had.

702
00:52:37,602 --> 00:52:39,695
You complete me.

703
00:52:41,005 --> 00:52:43,200
You know, marc was supposed
to be a girl.

704
00:52:44,742 --> 00:52:47,575
And this is popo.

705
00:52:47,745 --> 00:52:49,269
- Popo?
- Hi.

706
00:52:49,447 --> 00:52:51,540
He's doing the ceremony
with the rabbi.

707
00:52:52,150 --> 00:52:53,947
He is?

708
00:53:03,594 --> 00:53:05,858
The signature room?

709
00:53:06,297 --> 00:53:09,858
What happened to the marriott?
It's closer to the ground.

710
00:53:10,034 --> 00:53:11,729
Come on.

711
00:53:12,603 --> 00:53:14,696
The signature room.

712
00:53:14,872 --> 00:53:18,603
I've always wanted to come here,
but jerry gets vertigo.

713
00:53:18,776 --> 00:53:21,574
Thank you so much for the surprise.

714
00:53:21,746 --> 00:53:23,338
This would be steve's doing.

715
00:53:23,514 --> 00:53:24,674
He doesn't have a soul...

716
00:53:24,849 --> 00:53:28,410
...so he has to compensate
by making extravagant gestures.

717
00:53:28,586 --> 00:53:31,020
Well, marriage is difficult.

718
00:53:32,323 --> 00:53:35,759
But we had fantastic sex.

719
00:53:35,927 --> 00:53:38,794
Fantastic, angry...

720
00:53:38,963 --> 00:53:44,595
...crazy, crazy, crazy sex.

721
00:53:48,539 --> 00:53:50,006
Hey.

722
00:53:50,174 --> 00:53:53,473
- We're here.
- Oh, my god.

723
00:53:54,345 --> 00:53:56,939
Your dad must sell a lot of toner.

724
00:53:57,115 --> 00:54:00,482
Oh, hi. I'm so happy you could come.

725
00:54:03,988 --> 00:54:05,979
Roosevelt. This is it!

726
00:54:15,266 --> 00:54:16,790
Freeze!

727
00:54:17,668 --> 00:54:18,657
Hey.

728
00:54:19,971 --> 00:54:21,734
What's up?

729
00:54:22,306 --> 00:54:23,933
Got carlucci!
He found them.

730
00:54:24,108 --> 00:54:26,167
They're over at the hancock tower.

731
00:54:26,344 --> 00:54:28,209
Peyser set us up. Son of a bitch!

732
00:54:28,379 --> 00:54:32,406
I want the whole unit regrouped downstairs
in two minutes. Let's go!

733
00:54:32,984 --> 00:54:34,713
You're doing great, jer.

734
00:54:34,886 --> 00:54:37,855
First an airplane, now one
of the tallest buildings in the world.

735
00:54:38,022 --> 00:54:39,853
I'm proud of you.

736
00:54:40,291 --> 00:54:42,316
Has the elevator stopped?

737
00:54:42,794 --> 00:54:44,193
It's too high.

738
00:54:44,362 --> 00:54:46,159
Here, please.

739
00:54:46,497 --> 00:54:48,158
Water.

740
00:54:50,668 --> 00:54:53,535
- What's this?
- My collapsible cup.

741
00:54:53,938 --> 00:54:56,133
You're a piece of work, jer.

742
00:54:56,841 --> 00:55:00,709
If it's tap water,
let it run at least 20 seconds.

743
00:55:03,881 --> 00:55:05,610
Melissa! Melissa!

744
00:55:05,783 --> 00:55:07,512
Daddy, where the hell
have you been?

745
00:55:07,685 --> 00:55:10,779
First you plan this whole thing
without me, and then you disappear.

746
00:55:10,955 --> 00:55:13,515
- I don't know anyone here!
- I'm sorry. I went to france.

747
00:55:13,691 --> 00:55:15,352
It wasn't my fault.

748
00:55:15,526 --> 00:55:17,994
I just want everything to be wonderful,
that's all.

749
00:55:18,996 --> 00:55:20,793
Are you having a good time, at least?

750
00:55:20,965 --> 00:55:23,058
I'm trying to.

751
00:55:23,901 --> 00:55:25,129
No.

752
00:55:25,303 --> 00:55:27,794
- No?
- We have to do shots!

753
00:55:28,606 --> 00:55:30,801
Shots, shots, shots!

754
00:55:30,975 --> 00:55:32,806
- Are you okay?
- No!

755
00:55:32,977 --> 00:55:36,105
The fbi came to the house!

756
00:55:37,548 --> 00:55:41,211
It's steve. I talked to them.
He's a rogue agent. He's unstable!

757
00:55:41,385 --> 00:55:43,012
- Who?
- Steve.

758
00:55:43,187 --> 00:55:45,917
- He's a rogue xerox agent?
- No, no! Cia.

759
00:55:46,924 --> 00:55:49,825
I'm lucky to be here.
I had a roofie. I was on a plane!

760
00:55:49,994 --> 00:55:53,395
- That's right, you flew!
- I did. I did fly!

761
00:55:53,564 --> 00:55:54,929
Isn't that something?

762
00:55:55,333 --> 00:55:58,496
- The thing is, you gotta go private.
- Yeah.

763
00:56:35,373 --> 00:56:37,341
Oh, god.

764
00:56:37,742 --> 00:56:41,701
- Oh, there you are.
- Judy, judy, judy. How are you?

765
00:56:41,879 --> 00:56:43,437
You look great.

766
00:56:44,048 --> 00:56:45,606
It's the work at the ashram.

767
00:56:46,584 --> 00:56:48,575
- And the therapy.
- Really?

768
00:56:48,753 --> 00:56:51,950
And several powerful prescription drugs.

769
00:56:52,123 --> 00:56:54,614
I'm kidding about the drugs. Or am i?

770
00:56:54,792 --> 00:56:58,159
At any rate, let's give ourselves permission
to be honest with each other...

771
00:56:58,329 --> 00:57:00,263
...so we can have some closure
this weekend.

772
00:57:00,565 --> 00:57:01,554
Let's not.

773
00:57:01,732 --> 00:57:05,930
Why do you enjoy moving rehearsal
dinners and having everyone hate you?

774
00:57:06,671 --> 00:57:09,037
Another question. On your birthday...

775
00:57:09,207 --> 00:57:13,906
...why do you always end up in the bathtub
in the fetal position clutching a firearm?

776
00:57:14,078 --> 00:57:15,340
And one more.

777
00:57:16,047 --> 00:57:19,346
Why did you always weep like a little girl
during orgasm?

778
00:57:20,851 --> 00:57:25,117
Answer to all of the above:
Fear of intimacy.

779
00:57:25,289 --> 00:57:28,417
- Judy.
- You're heading for a crash, steve tobias.

780
00:57:28,593 --> 00:57:31,756
Into a mountain called
self-awareness.

781
00:57:31,929 --> 00:57:35,092
You have been running away
from yourself your whole life.

782
00:57:35,266 --> 00:57:37,097
No, i've been running away from you!

783
00:57:37,268 --> 00:57:40,294
Because i'm the only one
that's got your number!

784
00:57:45,876 --> 00:57:48,504
Let's go! Hurry.

785
00:57:52,516 --> 00:57:55,781
Well, you're here, and you seem fine.

786
00:57:55,953 --> 00:57:57,784
I seem fine? Have you heard nothing?

787
00:57:57,955 --> 00:58:00,355
What, am i not talking english?
This is fine to you?

788
00:58:00,524 --> 00:58:02,754
- Katherine, hi. How are you?
- Hi, steve.

789
00:58:02,927 --> 00:58:05,088
- Get away from me.
- I brought you your water.

790
00:58:05,263 --> 00:58:07,128
- Okay, thanks.
- Come on, let's go.

791
00:58:07,298 --> 00:58:08,595
No, l...

792
00:58:08,766 --> 00:58:10,927
get help. Get some help!

793
00:58:12,570 --> 00:58:13,559
Let's do it.

794
00:58:13,738 --> 00:58:16,036
What the hell is this?
I said, signature room!

795
00:58:16,207 --> 00:58:18,072
I did, i swear.

796
00:58:18,242 --> 00:58:19,504
Top floor.

797
00:58:19,677 --> 00:58:22,908
- Look, there are only three buttons.
- Signature room.

798
00:58:29,954 --> 00:58:32,821
Is this not a beautiful evening?

799
00:58:39,930 --> 00:58:44,060
Well, i stand before you this evening
as a very, very happy man.

800
00:58:44,235 --> 00:58:47,261
Not only has the almighty seen fit...

801
00:58:47,438 --> 00:58:50,805
...to provide me
with a beautiful new daughter...

802
00:58:52,777 --> 00:58:57,339
...but i am blessed with this man
here on my left.

803
00:58:57,515 --> 00:59:01,383
A man who's given so much to so many.

804
00:59:01,552 --> 00:59:05,852
A man who has a taste
for adventure...

805
00:59:06,023 --> 00:59:08,184
- this is your father, right?
- My dad?

806
00:59:08,359 --> 00:59:11,123
...who is willing to try new things.

807
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:16,793
Damn it!

808
00:59:16,967 --> 00:59:19,663
Let's take the stairs! Now!

809
00:59:20,471 --> 00:59:22,234
But most importantly...

810
00:59:22,406 --> 00:59:26,740
...a man who i know will always be close
in my heart.

811
00:59:27,244 --> 00:59:31,112
- A man who l...
- he is mentally ill!

812
00:59:32,183 --> 00:59:34,879
No, i mean it, he's dangerous!

813
00:59:36,721 --> 00:59:38,780
Listen, he gave me a roofie!

814
00:59:40,057 --> 00:59:42,491
He took me on a plane to france!

815
00:59:43,194 --> 00:59:45,958
Yeah, i took him to france!

816
00:59:47,331 --> 00:59:52,030
Stop it! He's a rogue agent!
He works for the other side!

817
00:59:52,203 --> 00:59:54,330
Call somebody!

818
00:59:56,907 --> 01:00:00,172
Well, enough of the hearts and flowers,
huh?

819
01:00:00,344 --> 01:00:02,710
We're here to have a good time,
right?

820
01:00:05,683 --> 01:00:07,651
Here we go!

821
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:13,950
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome
kc and the sunshine band!

822
01:00:18,629 --> 01:00:19,960
Oh, my god.

823
01:00:35,379 --> 01:00:38,041
Honey, this is the song we sang
on our first date!

824
01:00:38,215 --> 01:00:39,204
I know.

825
01:01:02,907 --> 01:01:05,171
You are one slick bastard.

826
01:01:07,878 --> 01:01:09,937
Look, leave me alone!

827
01:01:10,114 --> 01:01:13,015
Find somebody else to torture.

828
01:01:13,184 --> 01:01:16,051
- Okay.
- Thank you!

829
01:01:18,789 --> 01:01:20,484
Dr. Peyser.

830
01:01:22,693 --> 01:01:25,025
Agent hutchins, thank god!

831
01:01:25,229 --> 01:01:27,322
- You're under arrest.
- What are you doing?

832
01:01:27,498 --> 01:01:29,329
Stay where you are, dr. Peyser.

833
01:01:30,267 --> 01:01:32,201
Or should we call you fat cobra?

834
01:01:32,603 --> 01:01:34,036
I'm not the fat cobra!

835
01:01:34,205 --> 01:01:35,832
If necessary, shoot to kill.

836
01:01:36,006 --> 01:01:38,566
You got the wrong guy! I'm...

837
01:01:39,043 --> 01:01:41,273
there's 100 guns pointing at my head!

838
01:01:41,445 --> 01:01:44,278
- They think you're the fat cobra.
- Because you told them!

839
01:01:44,448 --> 01:01:48,407
- No, i didn't. You told them!
- No, i didn't!

840
01:01:53,858 --> 01:01:55,325
Meliss?

841
01:01:55,493 --> 01:01:59,759
Okay. It may not be the best time
to tell you this...

842
01:01:59,930 --> 01:02:04,424
...but a couple of years ago,
i slept with marc.

843
01:02:04,602 --> 01:02:08,265
And i think i'm still in love with him.

844
01:02:16,780 --> 01:02:17,940
What?

845
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:25,384
Yesterday, i was a respected man
in my community.

846
01:02:25,556 --> 01:02:27,421
Today, they want to kill me!

847
01:02:27,591 --> 01:02:28,819
My life is ruined!

848
01:02:28,993 --> 01:02:33,157
Jerry, i am sorry i ruined your life,
but you know what?

849
01:02:33,330 --> 01:02:35,423
This case is my life.

850
01:02:35,833 --> 01:02:37,528
I'm on a roof.

851
01:02:37,701 --> 01:02:39,566
I don't do roofs.

852
01:02:39,737 --> 01:02:41,432
Peyser, down on the ground!

853
01:02:42,506 --> 01:02:44,804
On the ground now!

854
01:02:45,442 --> 01:02:48,969
Well, buddy, i guess this is it, huh?
We tried.

855
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:51,908
- Give me a hug.
- What, are you crazy?

856
01:02:52,082 --> 01:02:54,141
- Fine, i'll hug you.
- No! What are you...?

857
01:02:54,318 --> 01:02:56,149
Wait! Wait! What are you doing?

858
01:02:56,320 --> 01:03:00,120
What are you doing?!
Holy mother of god!

859
01:03:02,192 --> 01:03:05,650
Now, you're gonna feel a slight jerk.

860
01:03:06,597 --> 01:03:11,364
- You're so much more than a slight jerk!
- That's not very nice.

861
01:03:12,002 --> 01:03:15,870
Jerry, listen to me. I need you
to keep your weight centered!

862
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:18,167
My weight's fine!

863
01:03:20,978 --> 01:03:22,445
- Help!
- We're fine!

864
01:03:22,613 --> 01:03:25,776
- Help!
- Have a good night!

865
01:03:27,484 --> 01:03:31,318
Get control! Get control, you schmuck!

866
01:03:31,488 --> 01:03:34,582
- You're not exactly helping things, jer.
- Helping how?

867
01:03:34,758 --> 01:03:35,918
- Unwrap your legs.
- What?

868
01:03:36,093 --> 01:03:37,958
Unwrap your legs!

869
01:03:38,128 --> 01:03:39,493
- All right!
- Thank you.

870
01:03:39,663 --> 01:03:43,463
I guess i forgot to take parachute etiquette
when i went to medical school!

871
01:03:43,634 --> 01:03:46,501
- This isn't fun.
- You gotta stop and smell those roses.

872
01:03:47,004 --> 01:03:50,303
Don't ever use that expression again!
Ever!

873
01:03:57,748 --> 01:04:00,842
We're about to get impaled by that!

874
01:04:02,286 --> 01:04:05,414
- What the hell is that?
- I don't know. I've always hated it.

875
01:04:07,358 --> 01:04:10,919
- Jer?
- Hold on to me! I'll hold on to you!

876
01:04:11,095 --> 01:04:14,531
It's okay. We're down. Easy, jer.

877
01:04:17,001 --> 01:04:17,990
Get off me!

878
01:04:22,473 --> 01:04:24,065
I'm choking!

879
01:04:24,241 --> 01:04:27,369
- All right. We're safe and sound.
- Unbuckle it. Quick.

880
01:04:27,544 --> 01:04:30,138
- We're neither!
- We are.

881
01:04:31,949 --> 01:04:35,043
- Okay, pal, let's get the hell out of here.
- No, no. I am done!

882
01:04:35,219 --> 01:04:37,119
I'm finished with you! I mean it!

883
01:04:37,621 --> 01:04:38,610
What do you mean?

884
01:04:38,789 --> 01:04:42,054
When i thought i was gonna die,
you know what image is in my head?

885
01:04:42,626 --> 01:04:43,752
No.

886
01:04:43,927 --> 01:04:47,294
I'm thinking of that look
my daughter gave me up there.

887
01:04:47,464 --> 01:04:50,922
I've given her these things she doesn't
want, and the one time she needs me...

888
01:04:51,101 --> 01:04:52,966
...where am i? I'm with you!

889
01:04:53,137 --> 01:04:55,901
Something you should work on, jer.

890
01:04:56,073 --> 01:04:58,701
- What did you say?
- I said...

891
01:04:59,410 --> 01:05:01,139
i have to work on that?

892
01:05:01,311 --> 01:05:06,146
The worst father in the universe is telling
me i gotta work on something?

893
01:05:06,316 --> 01:05:10,878
Do you know in the last three months i have
spent almost every day with your kid?

894
01:05:11,055 --> 01:05:13,546
Have you seen him even once?

895
01:05:14,425 --> 01:05:18,156
Were you even there for conception?
I bet you mailed your sperm in.

896
01:05:19,697 --> 01:05:21,995
I may be bad, granted,
but you're worse!

897
01:05:22,166 --> 01:05:25,499
Way worse! And you know i'm right!

898
01:05:31,475 --> 01:05:33,602
You're way off course.
What is he doing here?

899
01:05:33,777 --> 01:05:35,074
My least favorite person.

900
01:05:35,245 --> 01:05:37,270
You wanna do something about it,
fanny boy?

901
01:05:37,448 --> 01:05:39,678
- I do. I really do.
- Let's go.

902
01:05:39,850 --> 01:05:41,977
Come on. Bring it on.
You wanna fight me?

903
01:05:42,152 --> 01:05:46,179
Three rounds. Let's do it the right way.
He'll referee, we'll...

904
01:05:46,824 --> 01:05:49,384
it was before i even met you.

905
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:52,791
It doesn't bother me that you went out
with someone before you met me.

906
01:05:52,963 --> 01:05:55,227
- I went out with other guys!
- But that's not even...

907
01:05:55,399 --> 01:05:58,232
- you went out with other guys? Who?
- I've told you about them.

908
01:05:58,402 --> 01:06:01,701
And that's the thing. You weren't
as honest with me as i was with you.

909
01:06:01,872 --> 01:06:05,069
And by the way, can you just tell me
what your dad really does?

910
01:06:05,242 --> 01:06:09,440
Because he's got a few too many prada
and gucci outfits to be a xerox salesman.

911
01:06:10,047 --> 01:06:12,777
- I can't say.
- What?

912
01:06:13,050 --> 01:06:17,282
I mean, i really...
i'm not allowed to say.

913
01:06:17,454 --> 01:06:19,354
He made me vow.

914
01:06:20,257 --> 01:06:22,225
And i gave him my word.

915
01:06:22,893 --> 01:06:24,884
How good is your word?

916
01:06:26,196 --> 01:06:29,996
Okay. I just think you're feeling
a little nervous about the wedding.

917
01:06:30,334 --> 01:06:34,327
Don't tell me what i'm feeling!
My father does that.

918
01:07:08,639 --> 01:07:11,039
- So, what are you doing?
- Just confirming.

919
01:07:11,341 --> 01:07:14,105
Cherkasov's got her in position
five miles offshore.

920
01:07:14,278 --> 01:07:18,271
Thibodoux's guy is en route, and they're
both set for a noon exchange time.

921
01:07:18,448 --> 01:07:22,009
I guess i can squeeze it in between
the "i dos" and the appetizers.

922
01:07:25,322 --> 01:07:28,223
Unless you think i'm ready
to take the lead.

923
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:31,850
Excuse me.

924
01:07:32,029 --> 01:07:35,362
That's what i thought.
Always a bridesmaid, never a bride.

925
01:07:35,532 --> 01:07:38,000
Don't worry, i'm used to it.

926
01:08:03,961 --> 01:08:06,395
Push everything back.

927
01:08:06,563 --> 01:08:07,723
Meaning what?

928
01:08:07,898 --> 01:08:10,924
The whole exchange. Cherkasov,
thibodoux, the money, everything.

929
01:08:11,101 --> 01:08:14,036
Put it off until tomorrow
when the kids are on their honeymoon.

930
01:08:14,204 --> 01:08:16,638
I thought you were gonna
juggle both. You always do.

931
01:08:16,807 --> 01:08:19,071
I am tired of juggling.

932
01:08:19,243 --> 01:08:21,643
Cherkasov and thibodoux
are not gonna like this.

933
01:08:21,812 --> 01:08:25,248
- Well, they can kiss my ass.
- Fair enough.

934
01:08:25,415 --> 01:08:27,645
Did you get the tuxedos
from the dry cleaners?

935
01:08:27,818 --> 01:08:29,285
I sure did.

936
01:08:29,453 --> 01:08:33,116
- What about the pictures?
- Jacket pocket. Anything else?

937
01:08:35,525 --> 01:08:38,153
You look very nice this evening.

938
01:08:39,796 --> 01:08:41,559
Thank you.

939
01:08:52,943 --> 01:08:54,843
What are you doing?

940
01:08:55,012 --> 01:08:57,276
I'm just waiting for you,
mr. Bright eyes.

941
01:08:57,748 --> 01:09:00,649
- You dressed me?
- Yes, i did.

942
01:09:01,985 --> 01:09:03,953
So, jer, we gotta talk.

943
01:09:04,121 --> 01:09:07,818
I know we've had our differences, but our
son and daughter are gonna be married.

944
01:09:07,991 --> 01:09:11,119
And whether we like it or not,
we're stuck with each other.

945
01:09:11,762 --> 01:09:13,195
Yeah.

946
01:09:13,363 --> 01:09:16,389
So you knocked some sense
into me, father-wise...

947
01:09:16,566 --> 01:09:20,764
...and i'm gonna be changing my lifestyle.
No more shenanigans.

948
01:09:21,305 --> 01:09:23,830
And i'm not working today.

949
01:09:24,007 --> 01:09:26,032
Does the fbi know about this?

950
01:09:26,310 --> 01:09:27,504
It won't be a problem.

951
01:09:27,678 --> 01:09:32,377
This wedding is gonna be as normal
as butter on mashed potatoes.

952
01:09:32,549 --> 01:09:34,244
Come on, let's go.

953
01:09:50,467 --> 01:09:52,025
Freeze!

954
01:09:53,370 --> 01:09:57,636
Like butter on mashed potatoes, huh?
That lasted about 10 minutes.

955
01:09:57,808 --> 01:09:59,833
Jer, just relax.

956
01:10:01,244 --> 01:10:02,905
Hutchins...

957
01:10:03,747 --> 01:10:07,740
...do you have kids?
- I have a jack russell terrier.

958
01:10:07,918 --> 01:10:10,910
Well, then you'll understand.
You gotta give me two hours.

959
01:10:11,088 --> 01:10:15,047
- You're kidding me!
- This is my son's wedding.

960
01:10:15,325 --> 01:10:17,418
You can do anything you want
to me afterwards.

961
01:10:17,594 --> 01:10:19,960
You can take me out back,
shoot me, be a hero.

962
01:10:20,130 --> 01:10:22,394
But let me see my boy get married.

963
01:10:28,839 --> 01:10:30,898
- Or...
- hey! Hey! Hey!

964
01:10:31,775 --> 01:10:35,040
Well, maybe you ought
to just see this.

965
01:10:37,047 --> 01:10:38,537
What?

966
01:10:42,786 --> 01:10:44,413
Where'd you get...?

967
01:10:44,588 --> 01:10:48,285
- This was in college, man. I was pledging.
- Wow.

968
01:10:50,594 --> 01:10:53,085
- Stand down!
- That's a big pair of heels.

969
01:10:53,263 --> 01:10:55,288
Hutch, thanks so much.

970
01:10:55,465 --> 01:10:56,955
Yeah, thank you.

971
01:10:57,334 --> 01:10:59,802
We'll send out some cake later.

972
01:11:00,170 --> 01:11:02,263
Yeah, we'll be right here!

973
01:11:05,142 --> 01:11:08,771
- That was fun!
- Yeah. Blackmail. It's terrific.

974
01:11:09,346 --> 01:11:11,314
- Jerry!
- Uncle ben!

975
01:11:11,481 --> 01:11:12,743
- Mazel tov.
- Thanks.

976
01:11:12,916 --> 01:11:14,884
- Where's marc and melissa?
- Where are they?

977
01:11:15,052 --> 01:11:17,077
- Where are they?
- I don't know. Where are they?

978
01:11:17,254 --> 01:11:18,846
- I don't know.
- Ben, i'm asking you.

979
01:11:19,022 --> 01:11:20,489
- I'm asking you.
- I'm asking you.

980
01:11:20,657 --> 01:11:23,421
All right, stop!
We're turning into abbott and costello.

981
01:11:23,593 --> 01:11:25,527
I'm sure they're here.

982
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:27,185
- Dr. Peyser.
- Hi, rabbi.

983
01:11:27,364 --> 01:11:31,266
We're already behind schedule, and i do
have two other ceremonies this afternoon.

984
01:11:31,435 --> 01:11:34,893
- And that buddhist monk...
- that was not my idea.

985
01:11:35,072 --> 01:11:36,835
- What's wrong with him?
- He's an idiot.

986
01:11:37,007 --> 01:11:40,602
- Okay. Well, let me talk to him.
- Thank you.

987
01:11:40,777 --> 01:11:42,802
I don't know one person here!
Not one person.

988
01:11:42,979 --> 01:11:45,607
That's right,
because it's not an arms convention.

989
01:11:45,782 --> 01:11:47,807
Talk to these guys.

990
01:11:48,518 --> 01:11:49,780
- Hey, guys!
- Hey.

991
01:11:49,953 --> 01:11:51,352
Hi, who are you?

992
01:11:51,521 --> 01:11:54,354
- Marc's frat brothers. Who are you?
- I'm marc's dad.

993
01:11:54,524 --> 01:11:56,754
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

994
01:11:57,260 --> 01:12:00,354
- Marc never mentioned he had a dad.
- Like, not ever.

995
01:12:00,530 --> 01:12:02,191
Well, i'm traveling a lot.

996
01:12:02,365 --> 01:12:04,595
I just assumed that you were dead
or in jail.

997
01:12:04,768 --> 01:12:05,894
Me too.

998
01:12:06,069 --> 01:12:08,629
Well, fuck you very much
and have another beer.

999
01:12:08,805 --> 01:12:09,829
- Thanks a lot.
- Thanks.

1000
01:12:10,006 --> 01:12:12,634
Mr. Monk...

1001
01:12:12,809 --> 01:12:15,676
...if you two can't work this out,
the planet is doomed.

1002
01:12:15,846 --> 01:12:17,575
What can i do? Just talk to her.

1003
01:12:17,747 --> 01:12:19,009
- Dr. Peyser.
- Hi.

1004
01:12:19,182 --> 01:12:22,174
- Gloria, from before.
- Yeah, i know. Hi, gloria.

1005
01:12:22,352 --> 01:12:25,082
- Have you seen melissa?
- No, where is she?

1006
01:12:25,655 --> 01:12:27,486
I'm a little worried.

1007
01:12:27,657 --> 01:12:31,718
I got really wasted last night, and i did this
my best friend's wedding thing...

1008
01:12:31,895 --> 01:12:33,760
...and told her i dated marc
one time.

1009
01:12:33,930 --> 01:12:37,229
- You what?
- I think she may have bolted.

1010
01:12:44,574 --> 01:12:46,906
So, i thought you'd like
to know the wedding is off.

1011
01:12:47,077 --> 01:12:50,046
- Why? What happened?
- Marc and melissa have vanished.

1012
01:12:50,313 --> 01:12:53,749
Jerry, calm down.
It's all gonna be all right.

1013
01:12:57,854 --> 01:13:00,414
Melissa. Melissa!

1014
01:13:05,262 --> 01:13:07,321
Hey! I'll be right back.

1015
01:13:07,497 --> 01:13:09,089
Melissa!

1016
01:13:16,740 --> 01:13:18,503
Melissa...

1017
01:13:19,276 --> 01:13:22,040
...i know you're a little stressed out.
Well, so am i.

1018
01:13:22,212 --> 01:13:25,306
You know, it's a big day and,
you know, you're confused.

1019
01:13:25,482 --> 01:13:28,246
I was confused on the day
i got married.

1020
01:13:28,418 --> 01:13:29,715
Obviously.

1021
01:13:29,886 --> 01:13:32,787
I've never seen marc happier,
and i know it's because of you.

1022
01:13:32,956 --> 01:13:36,119
And i get down on my knees,
and i thank that big man up there...

1023
01:13:36,293 --> 01:13:37,783
...for you coming into his life.

1024
01:13:37,961 --> 01:13:40,555
And to tell you that the second
i saw you, i knew...

1025
01:13:40,730 --> 01:13:43,961
...you're the best girl in the world.

1026
01:13:45,869 --> 01:13:47,427
Hi, steve.

1027
01:13:48,305 --> 01:13:49,932
Oh, my god.

1028
01:14:00,717 --> 01:14:02,446
What are you doing in that dress?

1029
01:14:03,086 --> 01:14:06,146
I won't be the bridesmaid anymore.
Do you understand?

1030
01:14:06,323 --> 01:14:08,655
No! No, not really. No.

1031
01:14:09,059 --> 01:14:11,550
"I taught you.
When you're ready, take the lead."

1032
01:14:11,728 --> 01:14:13,821
Well, i'm ready,
and i'm taking the lead.

1033
01:14:13,997 --> 01:14:16,625
I don't wanna end up like you, steve.
No personal life...

1034
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:18,028
...a family that hates you.

1035
01:14:18,201 --> 01:14:20,999
I choose happiness!
It's really a breakthrough for me.

1036
01:14:21,171 --> 01:14:22,661
Now, where's the money?

1037
01:14:24,507 --> 01:14:26,771
It's in a case in the warehouse.

1038
01:14:26,943 --> 01:14:29,571
The case in the warehouse is empty.

1039
01:14:29,746 --> 01:14:31,441
We want the money.

1040
01:14:31,715 --> 01:14:32,841
We?

1041
01:14:54,037 --> 01:14:56,005
Jesus christ.

1042
01:14:56,439 --> 01:14:58,464
Oh, god.

1043
01:15:01,411 --> 01:15:02,969
What a lovely setting.

1044
01:15:03,146 --> 01:15:06,980
- I see your touch in the decor, no?
- I worked with the designer a little.

1045
01:15:07,150 --> 01:15:09,175
Why, it's wonderful.

1046
01:15:09,352 --> 01:15:15,313
I was on my way here, excited about my
submarine, and then i realized something.

1047
01:15:15,825 --> 01:15:18,623
Do you want to know what it was
that i realized?

1048
01:15:19,229 --> 01:15:22,357
- Sure.
- I was more excited to see you.

1049
01:15:23,767 --> 01:15:26,258
- I cannot get you out of my mind.
- Okay.

1050
01:15:26,436 --> 01:15:29,462
I am attracted to you physically,
which for me is very strange...

1051
01:15:29,639 --> 01:15:32,403
...because i find homosexuality
disgusting!

1052
01:15:34,177 --> 01:15:36,543
This is a big subject.

1053
01:15:37,113 --> 01:15:40,549
And, you know, the wedding,
so i actually have to find my family.

1054
01:15:40,717 --> 01:15:42,708
I'll talk to you later.

1055
01:15:43,086 --> 01:15:46,055
- I have them.
- You what?

1056
01:15:49,426 --> 01:15:50,757
What are you doing in that?

1057
01:15:50,927 --> 01:15:52,724
Steven,
i see you have met my partner.

1058
01:15:53,229 --> 01:15:56,062
Yeah, you make a lovely couple.

1059
01:15:57,367 --> 01:16:00,234
- So where's cherkasov?
- Dead.

1060
01:16:00,837 --> 01:16:02,862
What about olga?

1061
01:16:09,913 --> 01:16:14,441
- Steven tobias, you son of a bitch!
- Lf we don't die, i'm gonna kill you, dad!

1062
01:16:14,617 --> 01:16:16,209
- You suck!
- She's wearing my dress!

1063
01:16:16,386 --> 01:16:17,751
Quiet!

1064
01:16:19,989 --> 01:16:21,547
If i give you the money...

1065
01:16:21,958 --> 01:16:24,654
...will you leave everybody here
unharmed?

1066
01:16:25,028 --> 01:16:26,290
Of course.

1067
01:16:28,631 --> 01:16:33,432
Hi. Since we can't find the bride and the
groom, we're just gonna open up the bar.

1068
01:16:33,603 --> 01:16:36,868
So everybody have a cocktail!

1069
01:16:46,950 --> 01:16:48,941
That would've made a great gift.

1070
01:16:49,352 --> 01:16:50,614
Now get out.

1071
01:16:58,862 --> 01:17:00,796
Are you coming, sweet cobra?

1072
01:17:07,937 --> 01:17:10,428
- Daddy, this is weird.
- Where you going, jerry?

1073
01:17:10,607 --> 01:17:12,507
I'm sorry, katherine.

1074
01:17:17,714 --> 01:17:20,945
Can i talk to you alone for one second?
It's about us.

1075
01:17:21,117 --> 01:17:23,950
- We don't have time to dilly-dally.
- Pull around the boat.

1076
01:17:27,457 --> 01:17:28,515
What is it, darling?

1077
01:17:28,825 --> 01:17:31,692
What am i to you, exactly?
A plaything? Or a toy?

1078
01:17:31,861 --> 01:17:33,795
- No, no, no.
- Okay.

1079
01:17:33,963 --> 01:17:35,362
Let's do this the right way.

1080
01:17:35,732 --> 01:17:37,996
Jean-pierre, i love you.

1081
01:17:38,568 --> 01:17:40,399
And i want you to be...

1082
01:17:40,570 --> 01:17:42,504
...my wife!

1083
01:17:45,475 --> 01:17:48,410
How's the plantar fasciitis now?!

1084
01:17:48,678 --> 01:17:50,236
Help!

1085
01:17:52,482 --> 01:17:55,076
Jean-pierre, come on, we have to go.

1086
01:17:55,819 --> 01:17:58,083
I keep making myself vulnerable.

1087
01:17:58,521 --> 01:18:00,546
Focus on revenge.

1088
01:18:06,329 --> 01:18:08,160
Well, steve...

1089
01:18:08,331 --> 01:18:10,390
...you have ruined this darling girl's
wedding.

1090
01:18:10,567 --> 01:18:13,365
- No, no. I'm okay.
- No, you're not!

1091
01:18:13,536 --> 01:18:17,063
You will carry the scar of this day
until you die.

1092
01:18:18,007 --> 01:18:19,770
All right, i guess i am kind of sad.

1093
01:18:19,943 --> 01:18:21,934
Judy, how is this helpful?

1094
01:18:22,111 --> 01:18:25,080
Would both of you please just stop it?!

1095
01:18:25,248 --> 01:18:27,341
Why don't you give me a break, huh?

1096
01:18:28,051 --> 01:18:29,143
I'll break your neck!

1097
01:18:29,319 --> 01:18:31,480
That's good, marc.
Express your anger.

1098
01:18:31,654 --> 01:18:33,554
- You want a piece of me?
- You bet i do!

1099
01:18:33,723 --> 01:18:35,418
Here it goes!

1100
01:18:43,533 --> 01:18:45,262
Oh, my god!

1101
01:18:46,503 --> 01:18:47,492
What was that?

1102
01:18:47,670 --> 01:18:49,831
The one time my dad showed up
at cub scouts...

1103
01:18:50,006 --> 01:18:53,169
...i earned a merit badge
in covert evasion techniques.

1104
01:19:00,250 --> 01:19:02,844
- What happened?
- We broke up.

1105
01:19:05,755 --> 01:19:07,120
What is that?

1106
01:19:09,492 --> 01:19:12,154
That, my friend, is olga.

1107
01:19:12,328 --> 01:19:14,091
In lake michigan?

1108
01:19:14,264 --> 01:19:17,256
So much for homeland security.

1109
01:19:24,374 --> 01:19:27,275
I'm excited to go on a submarine.

1110
01:19:29,579 --> 01:19:31,274
What was your name again?

1111
01:19:31,981 --> 01:19:34,006
It's angela.

1112
01:19:36,052 --> 01:19:37,576
Goodbye, angela.

1113
01:19:41,190 --> 01:19:43,658
- What are you doing?
- Taking preventative measures.

1114
01:19:43,826 --> 01:19:44,815
To prevent what?

1115
01:19:44,994 --> 01:19:47,019
May be a torpedo heading towards
the wedding.

1116
01:19:47,196 --> 01:19:48,288
What?

1117
01:19:48,464 --> 01:19:51,456
- I'm gonna come with you.
- Sorry, buddy. It's a one-man job.

1118
01:19:51,634 --> 01:19:54,034
You drag me around the world
when i don't want to go.

1119
01:19:54,203 --> 01:19:56,797
The one time i want to, you say no?
It's my family too.

1120
01:19:56,973 --> 01:20:00,568
- I'm going. You can't stop me.
- Wow, jer.

1121
01:20:00,743 --> 01:20:03,211
- Get on.
- On this?

1122
01:20:06,282 --> 01:20:07,271
Okay.

1123
01:20:09,986 --> 01:20:11,715
What is the plan?

1124
01:20:11,888 --> 01:20:16,723
The juliett-class torpedo has
an acoustic guidance system.

1125
01:20:16,893 --> 01:20:19,259
It tracks whatever's making
the most noise.

1126
01:20:19,429 --> 01:20:22,694
So if he pulls the trigger,
we've gotta divert the torpedo.

1127
01:20:22,999 --> 01:20:24,899
Towards what?

1128
01:20:26,069 --> 01:20:29,470
Let me rephrase the question.
What does the torpedo wind up hitting?

1129
01:20:29,639 --> 01:20:31,732
- You said you wanted to help.
- Oh, my god.

1130
01:20:31,908 --> 01:20:34,843
That's before i knew the plan!
It's a terrible plan!

1131
01:21:02,639 --> 01:21:05,233
How are you doing?
You doing okay?

1132
01:21:06,509 --> 01:21:11,674
Yeah. You know,
i got a few questions, like...

1133
01:21:12,649 --> 01:21:15,379
...what the hell is happening?

1134
01:21:16,185 --> 01:21:18,710
My father is in the cia.
He works deep undercover.

1135
01:21:18,888 --> 01:21:21,356
I've spent my life hiding that,
but that's the truth.

1136
01:21:21,858 --> 01:21:26,056
I dated a few skanky girls before i met you.
I don't really like being a lawyer.

1137
01:21:26,229 --> 01:21:28,459
Played with legos until i was 17...

1138
01:21:28,631 --> 01:21:32,624
...and i go to a colorist because
i'm prematurely gray. It's a rinse.

1139
01:21:33,736 --> 01:21:35,135
Really?

1140
01:21:35,304 --> 01:21:38,740
I don't want to hide anything
from you anymore, because i don't care!

1141
01:21:38,908 --> 01:21:40,773
All i care about is you!

1142
01:21:40,943 --> 01:21:42,604
- Marc!
- What?

1143
01:21:44,347 --> 01:21:45,974
I love you.

1144
01:21:53,156 --> 01:21:55,488
What are we doing now?

1145
01:21:55,658 --> 01:21:58,149
Why are we turning?

1146
01:21:59,162 --> 01:22:00,891
Make noise!

1147
01:22:03,332 --> 01:22:06,392
Quiet! No noise!

1148
01:22:07,770 --> 01:22:09,601
Hi!

1149
01:22:15,011 --> 01:22:16,911
Wait, wait! I've got something...

1150
01:22:17,346 --> 01:22:19,644
...in my fanny pack!

1151
01:22:21,317 --> 01:22:22,909
Look!

1152
01:22:24,187 --> 01:22:28,283
- I'll never make a crack again!
- Yeah, because we'll be dead!

1153
01:22:47,210 --> 01:22:48,609
Hold on! Hold on!

1154
01:22:48,778 --> 01:22:50,268
I'm gonna throw up!

1155
01:22:55,551 --> 01:22:57,212
It's coming at us!

1156
01:23:02,391 --> 01:23:04,222
Could you stop that, please?

1157
01:23:04,393 --> 01:23:06,088
Touchy.

1158
01:23:12,301 --> 01:23:15,793
All in all, i'm glad i met you!

1159
01:23:15,972 --> 01:23:18,406
Me too, buddy! I mean it!

1160
01:23:18,775 --> 01:23:20,242
You're the real thing!

1161
01:23:20,409 --> 01:23:24,311
I'm sorry i called you the worst father
in the world! I really didn't mean it!

1162
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:25,504
Thank you, jer.

1163
01:23:25,681 --> 01:23:29,412
I'm sure there's at least two
or three guys that are worse!

1164
01:25:13,155 --> 01:25:15,646
That's so awesome!

1165
01:25:15,825 --> 01:25:19,420
Marc? Marc? Honey? Honey?

1166
01:25:19,595 --> 01:25:21,187
Honey, are you okay?

1167
01:25:21,364 --> 01:25:22,922
Baby, are you okay?

1168
01:25:23,099 --> 01:25:26,762
Yeah, but there's cake in my shorts.

1169
01:25:36,712 --> 01:25:38,270
Wait.

1170
01:25:44,353 --> 01:25:46,878
We're gonna go freshen up.

1171
01:25:53,863 --> 01:25:56,297
Are you guys all right?

1172
01:25:57,466 --> 01:25:59,058
Steve?

1173
01:25:59,235 --> 01:26:03,194
We just wanted to let you know this was
the worst wedding we have ever been to.

1174
01:26:03,372 --> 01:26:06,466
You should thank jerry.
He put it all together.

1175
01:26:07,243 --> 01:26:09,040
Thanks for coming.

1176
01:26:09,612 --> 01:26:12,672
We gotta do something about this.
Come on.

1177
01:26:16,018 --> 01:26:20,318
I know you all got a lot of questions,
but listen up.

1178
01:26:20,489 --> 01:26:24,789
I am deep cover cia,
case number 3924.

1179
01:26:24,961 --> 01:26:27,486
Peter markell's my sole contact
at the agency.

1180
01:26:27,663 --> 01:26:30,063
All right. Well, we're gonna check that out.

1181
01:26:30,232 --> 01:26:32,962
You know, you almost blew my cover
a few times.

1182
01:26:33,135 --> 01:26:34,727
But i don't want an apology...

1183
01:26:34,904 --> 01:26:38,271
...because i think i got a way
that you can make it up.

1184
01:26:40,076 --> 01:26:44,376
And do you, melissa, take marc
to be your wedded husband...

1185
01:26:44,547 --> 01:26:47,641
...to have and to hold
from this day forward...

1186
01:26:47,817 --> 01:26:51,014
...for better or worse,
for richer or poorer...

1187
01:26:51,320 --> 01:26:54,517
...in sickness and in health,
till death do you part?

1188
01:26:54,690 --> 01:26:56,419
I do.

1189
01:26:56,726 --> 01:27:00,822
By the power vested in me
by the federal bureau of investigation...

1190
01:27:00,997 --> 01:27:04,023
...i now pronounce you man and wife.

1191
01:27:04,200 --> 01:27:05,895
You may kiss the bride.

1192
01:27:08,704 --> 01:27:10,262
Yeah.

1193
01:27:14,310 --> 01:27:16,244
- Mazel tov!
- Mazel tov.

1194
01:27:40,269 --> 01:27:42,829
You know how i run around
and try to save the world?

1195
01:27:43,172 --> 01:27:45,606
- Dad, it's okay.
- No, no. No.

1196
01:27:45,775 --> 01:27:49,176
What i want you to know
is, you are my world, marc.

1197
01:27:49,345 --> 01:27:51,404
I'm so proud of you.

1198
01:27:53,549 --> 01:27:55,016
Congratulations.

1199
01:28:06,362 --> 01:28:09,195
I know we fought a lot,
but we must have done something right.

1200
01:28:09,365 --> 01:28:11,663
He's a great kid.

1201
01:28:12,668 --> 01:28:14,659
And you're a very good mother.

1202
01:28:16,405 --> 01:28:17,804
Thank you.

1203
01:28:18,207 --> 01:28:19,799
You're welcome.

1204
01:28:20,810 --> 01:28:22,539
And i still hate you.

1205
01:28:25,915 --> 01:28:28,713
But i do have a room back
at the club.

1206
01:28:33,355 --> 01:28:35,255
I am so sorry about the wedding.

1207
01:28:35,458 --> 01:28:38,859
What are you talking about?
Daddy, don't you realize?

1208
01:28:39,028 --> 01:28:40,017
What?

1209
01:28:40,429 --> 01:28:43,398
This is exactly what i wanted.

1210
01:28:43,766 --> 01:28:46,234
Six people on a beach.

1211
01:28:48,504 --> 01:28:49,801
- Good.
- I love you.

1212
01:28:50,439 --> 01:28:51,667
Thank you.

1213
01:28:51,841 --> 01:28:53,832
I love you too.

1214
01:28:57,580 --> 01:28:59,207
Thanks.

1215
01:29:04,687 --> 01:29:06,951
Six people on a beach.

1216
01:29:07,623 --> 01:29:09,523
I could have saved a fortune!

1217
01:29:09,692 --> 01:29:12,820
Jer, you're gonna be fine.

1218
01:29:15,831 --> 01:29:18,356
As a matter of fact...

1219
01:29:18,534 --> 01:29:23,494
...the whole family,
they're gonna be just fine.

1220
01:29:31,046 --> 01:29:33,446
Cobra! Fat cobra!

1221
01:29:33,616 --> 01:29:35,811
It's all right, darling!

1222
01:29:35,985 --> 01:29:37,953
I forgive you!

1223
01:29:41,257 --> 01:29:42,986
Call me.

1224
01:29:44,160 --> 01:29:47,857
You know something?
He might actually like prison.

1225
01:29:48,030 --> 01:29:49,827
Like it?

1226
01:29:50,166 --> 01:29:52,930
He's gonna love it.

1227
01:31:58,460 --> 01:32:02,191
A little help would be nice!

1228
01:32:03,632 --> 01:32:05,759
Anybody?
