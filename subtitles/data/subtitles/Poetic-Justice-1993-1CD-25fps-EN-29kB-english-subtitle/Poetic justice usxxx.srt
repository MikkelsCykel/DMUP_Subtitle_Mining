1
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,470
-You like the wine?
-Very much.

2
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,430
-Would you like some more?
-Please. No. Here.

3
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,030
You're good.

4
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,680
The wine, candles, the dinner.

5
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,400
What's next?

6
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,440
Let me set the mood.

7
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,880
Last time I saw a woman drink
like that, she was drowning.

8
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,750
-Did she die?
-I don't know. I was just a lifeguard.

9
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:57,560
You know, I don't want you
to get the wrong impression...

10
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,800
...that I invited you up here...

11
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:40,200
Markell, get your hand out of my shirt.
Come on, Markell, stop.

12
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,040
-Let's get in the back seat.
-Why can't we just watch the movie?

13
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,750
-lt's boring.
-This movie ain't boring, it's good.

14
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,920
Give me a kiss. Give me a kiss.

15
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,280
-Do you love me, baby?
-Of course I love you.

16
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,200
Tell me why.
Tell me why you love me.

17
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:12,360
-Right now?
-Right now. I wanna know.

18
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,480
'Cause you're fine.

19
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,310
That's deep. That's real deep.
'Cause I'm fine.

20
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,710
But I see where you coming f rom.

21
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,680
-Why you trippin'?
-I ain't trippin'.

22
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:27,280
Let's get in the back seat
so you can give me some sugar.

23
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,120
-Can you get me popcorn? I'm hungry.
-Popcorn?

24
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,990
Some popcorn, please?
Something. Jujubes. Go on, please?

25
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,680
-I don't believe this.
-Get me popcorn.

26
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:44,480
And some Jujubes. And some Bonbons!

27
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,240
Justice, I was just thinking.

28
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,030
The real reason why I love you is
because, when I was in jail...

29
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,680
...you sent me all them nice poems.

30
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,680
I'm gonna get your popcorn.

31
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,470
-Kick him in the head.
-You're worried about nothing.

32
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,360
I'll f uck this f ool up.

33
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,360
Damn.

34
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:26,760
I ain't giving you
no more quarters. Shit!

35
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:39,240
Is that the motherf ucker
that was at the mall the other day?

36
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,990
-ls that him?
-I don't know.

37
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,400
-Look at his f ace, dude.
-That's not him.

38
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,400
That's him, dude, I'm telling you.
I remember him. That's him.

39
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,520
Let me get a...

40
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:04,880
That's that nigga that was talking shit
in f ront of all his homeboys.

41
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,640
Popcorn and Jujubes.

42
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,270
Shit. Look.

43
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,670
Oh, man. Shit.

44
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,000
You're sick!

45
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,390
-ls that a crime?
-Save it.

46
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,720
I think I just saw those f ools
I had beef with last week.

47
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,480
So I shot.

48
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,510
Aaain, and aaain, and aaain.

49
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:05,480
Oh, it felt so aood.

50
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,440
But in the end, I was still horny.

51
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:15,240
My sweet abyss still existed.

52
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,880
Markell! Markell, get up, baby.

53
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,400
Markell, baby, wake up. Markell!

54
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,680
Somebody help me, please!

55
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,480
Somebody help me!

56
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,240
Alone
Lyina, thinkina last niaht

57
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,920
How to find my soul a home

58
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,680
Where water is not thirsty
And bread loaf is not stone

59
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:22,630
I came up with one thina
And I don't believe I'm wrona

60
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,080
That nobody, but nobody
Can make it out here alone

61
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,080
Alone, all alone

62
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,870
Nobody, but nobody
Can make it out here alone

63
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,480
There are some millionaires
With money they can't use

64
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:53,240
Their wives run 'round like banshees
Their children sina the blues

65
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:57,240
They've aot expensive doctors to cure
Their hearts of stone

66
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:03,000
But nobody, no, nobody
Can make it out here alone

67
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,880
Now if you listen closely
I'll tell you what I know

68
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,910
Storm clouds are aatherina
The wind is aonna blow

69
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,870
The race of man is sufferina
And I can hear the moan

70
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:27,360
'Cause nobody, but nobody
Can make it out here alone

71
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,600
Alone, all alone

72
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:40,080
Nobody, but nobody
Can make it out here alone

73
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,960
We got the situation under control.

74
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,510
Just get out of here.
Let us do our job.

75
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:56,070
We got the situation under control.

76
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:05,200
Look at these. This one right here,
this is bad. Girl, that is to die f or.

77
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,840
Jessie's. We do hair.

78
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,880
He just did my girl all wrong.

79
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:14,800
She's scared as hell. I caught her
running around here wearing sunglasses.

80
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,350
And you know how she like bragging
about her green eyes.

81
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:22,280
Top it off, she's still
in love with the nigga.

82
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,720
What's love got to do with it?

83
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,520
You just telling everybody's business.

84
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,200
I'd tell your business too
if you had something to tell.

85
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:35,160
Hey, Heywood. Hey, Dex.
How you doing, Maxine?

86
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:38,560
Come on, girl. You ready?
You got your hair with you?

87
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,920
What you think this is?

88
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,320
-I know you ain't getting smart.
-Shut up, girl.

89
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,840
That's what I thought. Come on.
Sit your butt down.

90
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,920
-So, what's up?
-Nothing up.

91
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,310
Morning, Jessie. Got any change?

92
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,960
Hell, no. And get your dirty,
unemployed ass away f rom my shop.

93
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,760
Baha? Baby, do me a f avour.

94
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:17,400
Go to the liquor store and get me
two honey buns and... What else?

95
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,240
Some Big Red. Yeah, I know.

96
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,760
-Twenty.
-Yeah, a 20.

97
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,600
And bring me my change!

98
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,600
Leave this conditioner on
f or five minutes.

99
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,990
You like that, don't you?

100
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,480
-Jessie, you are so beautif ul.
-Thank you, Heywood.

101
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,680
-I love you.
-I love you too.

102
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:45,120
-And I love myself.
-I know. Get back to your client.

103
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,400
I love it when you're so f orcef ul.

104
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,680
So...

105
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,720
Yeah.

106
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,240
-So he's out, huh?
-I don't know. I'm thinking about it.

107
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,520
I know y'all got
buck-wild last night.

108
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:12,310
-Where did y'all go?
-Could you put those over here?

109
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,280
-Snooty Fox Motor Inn.
-No, you didn't.

110
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:19,040
People, please remember
to turn in your receipts.

111
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,310
-We always do.
-I got mine right here.

112
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:25,760
-Still got them red walls and all that?
-Mirrors on the ceiling.

113
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:30,200
Same old, same old. I'm coming
up short. Are they turning in receipts?

114
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,720
They've been filling them out
and turning them in.

115
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:36,120
When was the last time you were there?

116
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,720
-What, Snooty Fox?
-Yeah.

117
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:42,240
-lt's been so long, I don't remember.
-That's what I know.

118
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,600
My girl need her hair
and her nails done.

119
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,200
-Does she have an appointment?
-No.

120
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,280
-She don't have no hair, either.
-Heywood.

121
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:56,840
Maxine. Make an appointment.

122
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:01,560
Why are you always wearing hats?
What are you hiding?

123
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,680
-Give me my hat. I got new growth.
-Put it back on.

124
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:08,920
You need to let me do something
to that head of yours.

125
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:13,720
Lord, I'm tired. You got a poem f or me?
Lord knows I need one.

126
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,270
I left my notebook in the car.

127
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,080
-Outgoing mail.
-Where are the stamps?

128
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:24,920
When you going to get a man?
Always asking questions about mine...

129
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,310
What, you still in mourning?

130
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:32,960
Sporting black, looking tore up f rom
the floor up, no time f or your hair.

131
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,240
You can always tell when a woman
ain't giving up no coochie.

132
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:42,040
I like wearing black. Besides, I ain't
got time f or no man in my life.

133
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,320
-Know what your problem is?
-So suddenly I got a problem?

134
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,440
-What's my problem?
-You make bad choices in men.

135
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,360
You don't know how to pick them.

136
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:05,480
Yo, what's up? What's up, Mr. Postman?
Got some spare change?

137
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:10,160
No, but I got a spare stamp
so you can mail a job application.

138
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,470
Begging-ass motherf ucker.

139
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,680
Y'all didn't get nothing but bills.

140
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,080
Why you always so mad?

141
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:35,520
You must ain't got no man
'cause you don't never smile.

142
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:39,920
-Do you?
-What do you want f rom me?

143
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:46,160
I think you kind of fly.
We could start with your phone number.

144
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,280
What's your name?

145
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,320
-Lucky.
-Lucky?

146
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,470
Come here, Lucky.
I wanna whisper something to you.

147
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,080
Let's cut the bullshit.

148
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:15,600
Now, what do you really,
really want f rom me?

149
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:20,800
-You wanna smell my poonani?
-Yeah.

150
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,390
You'd like that, huh?

151
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:30,000
Hold on a minute, baby.

152
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,840
Jessie? Come here
f or a minute, please.

153
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,080
What?

154
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,710
This fine, young, dark brother...

155
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:45,080
...said he wanna smell my poonani.

156
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,080
Really?

157
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,280
Poonani?

158
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,760
-Should I let him?
-Yeah.

159
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,800
What do you think?

160
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:09,880
You need to get your ass some
breath mints. Crazy black bitches.

161
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,240
Get your ass out of here.

162
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,680

163
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,600

164
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,600
Don't smoke it.
Take a stamp too.

165
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,840
God bless you, brother.
Bless you, man!

166
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,760
I'm not f ucking with 101st no more.

167
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:33,040
I told that lady about them dogs.
She wants her mail, she gets it herself.

168
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:37,320
Did you not once consider
using your Mace?

169
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:41,960
Mace? That's like Binaca to rottweilers.
Y'all don't pay me enough!

170
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:46,280
-You're saying you don't want your job?
-Here you go.

171
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,920
Fucked his nose up.

172
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:54,680
Right in the middle, man.
Just like Robin Hood.

173
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:58,310
Y'all wanna get your asses to work
bef ore you get fired?

174
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,240
-What's up, sergeant?

175
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,080
-I can't call it.

-Again?
-Got me sorting mail with Mexicans.

178
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,920
Chicago, why you talking
about Mexicans? I'll kick your ass.

179
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:18,600
Tell you what, you better quit
smoking that shit at lunch.

180
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,600
At least we got our own country.

181
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:24,070
Then why the f uck y'all
keep sneaking out?

182
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,880
That shit is f unny, right?

183
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,640
Basketball-playing motherf uckers.

184
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:37,480
-I'm going to Oaktown. You wanna go?
-Yeah.

185
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:40,950
-You gonna bring a yamp?
-Here you go. You gonna bring a yamp?

186
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:45,240
-I got mine, man.
-Yamps. What the f uck is a "yamp"?

187
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,040
A young tramp. Now, do you mind?

188
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,990
Don't worry about
what the players is talking about.

189
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:57,840
Go have your yamps, corn bread,
ham hocks and whatever else you eat.

190
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,920
-Get out of here.

193
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,710
-I'm gonna hook you up.
-You always say that.

194
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,350
-Hook me up.
-You gonna call your cousin?

195
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:18,430
Not yet. We're supposed to find a way
up there anyway f or our music thing.

196
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,920
Now it's like I'm getting paid

197
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,280
-See you later.
-Where you going?

198
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,280

204
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:16,670
-Popped his ass out, straight twisted.
-Gone?

205
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,680
But we gonna get the f ools

206
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:23,520
-Ain't no thing but a chicken wing.

207
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,910

-All right. Peace.

208
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,760
-Yeah, peace.
-There won't be no peace today.

209
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:33,390
Get you a motherf ucking
tune-up, nigga.

210
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:43,070
There he is.
Mr. Postman working motherf ucker here.

211
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,040
-Don't start. What's up, Bone?
-What's up?

212
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,910
-Shit. I can't call it.
-How you feeling?

213
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,870
-Tired than a motherf ucker.
-Tired, huh?

214
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:57,590
This ain't none of that chronic,
but you can use some of this Thai bud.

215
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,230
They checking my piss at work.
I can't f uck with it.

216
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,160
That's a terrible thing.

217
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,320
How you doing, Ms. Jackson?

218
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:22,680
-She can't stand me with a passion.
-She hates your ass.

219
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,720
So, what's up?
You here to check up on Keisha?

220
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,120
I'm gonna give Angel money
to buy her clothes.

221
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:35,070
Now, you know motherf ucking well
you ain't gotta give her money.

222
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:39,560
I'll take her to the swap meet, Fox
Hills Mall, get her whatever she needs.

223
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,680
No. You ain't got to do that.

224
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,880
-What you mean?
-lt's my daughter. I can handle it.

225
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,200
What did I tell you about this change?
Do I look like Las Vegas?

226
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,600
-Do I look like a slot machine?
-lt's all I got.

227
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:59,680
Get your punk ass up out of here
and don't do that shit no more.

228
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:03,560
-You cold on these f ools.
-I can't help it.

229
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:07,510
Check this out. It ain't like
I ain't got the money.

230
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,310
Besides, she call me Daddy
sometimes, anyway.

231
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:16,000
-What you mean, she call you Daddy?
-Just what I said.

232
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,520
-We gonna see who she call Daddy.
-We'll see.

233
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,190
-We gonna find out.
-What we gonna find out, then?

234
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,320
Well, let's see, then.

235
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,790
Well, hurry your slow ass up, then.

236
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,680
Keisha.

237
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,480
Hi, Daddy.

238
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,600
-Who's your daddy?
-You.

239
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:42,440
That's right. That's your son and
this is my daughter. Don't f orget it.

240
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,800
Pothead.

241
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:50,800
It's like I'm her daddy since they
came f rom the same tired-ass hooker.

242
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,600
How's that?

243
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:56,040
-Difference.
-What's up, boy?

244
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,710

00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:08,520
-Talking about your yamp ass.
-Here we go. Simple Nick in the house.

247
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,990
Get your ass away f rom the TV.

248
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:16,600
What you cleaning up f or?
This place looks f ucked up as normal.

250
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:28,880

Saying, " I do, " to neither one of you.

251
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,470
-Has she?
-No, this is what you do:

252
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:36,080
Get her and get out of my house. Don't
f orget to get her some tennis shoes...

253
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,120
If welf are wasn't paying the rent,
this wouldn't be your house.

254
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,800
-Fuck you.
-Get your ass back in the room. Tramp.

255
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,880
You know what I told your ass
about that shit!

256
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,190
Told her if I catch her doing
that shit again, I'm taking Keisha.

257
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:57,840
-She ain't got to be around this shit.
-Nothing wrong with her. She's crazy.

258
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:01,720
If something was wrong with her ass,
I'd know.

259
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,520
Brother Bone! Brother Bone!

260
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:12,000
Every time I sit down and wanna watch
a cartoon, somebody gotta call me.

261
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:17,640
-Here we go. Scarf ace.

Go over there and sit with Tony, okay?

265
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:32,320
-What's up with all this change?
-That's all I got.

266
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:35,120
How do you like the Felix outfit?

267
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,480
Never mind that!
Just aet the diamonds!

268
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,400
Wow, professor! Look at that!

269
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:47,400
Loose diamonds.
Let's ao down and pick them up.

270
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:51,000
Who's that little character?

00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:57,960
-Oh, my God!
-Hey, nigga. Get the f uck out of here.

00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:02,360
-That is Lucky. That is Lucky!
-Lucky who? Get the f uck out.

273
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,720
Come on, Keisha.
We're going to see your grandma.

274
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,480
Don't be coming in my house
starting all that bullshit!

275
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,840
How you gonna be f ucking some nigga
when my daughter's here?

276
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,360
Damn, here they go.

277
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:24,400
-Who is this motherf ucker?
-Mind your own motherf ucking business.

278
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,160
-I don't need this shit!
-Stupid-ass motherf ucker.

279
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:56,710
-I wanna go too.
-Where are you taking Keisha?

280
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,080
How you gonna be f ucking some nigga
while my daughter here?

281
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:03,120
Where you going with my
goddamn child?

282
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:06,000
In a time of secret wooina

283
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:09,760
Today prepares tomorrow's ruin

284
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:13,200
Left knows not what riaht is doina

285
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,360
My heart is torn asunder

286
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,720
In a time of furtive siahs

287
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,350
Sweet hellos and sad aoodbyes

288
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:25,960
Half-truths told and entire lies

289
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:30,720
My conscience echoes thunder

290
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,680
In a time when kinadoms come

291
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,800
Joy is brief as summer's fun

292
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,240
Happiness
Its race has run

293
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,680
Then pain stalks in to plunder

294
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:53,160
-So, what you think?
-lt's pretty. What you call it?

295
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,880
" In a Time."

296
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:02,320
Chicago paging me.
Let me see what he wants.

297
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,200
I can't use your phone?

298
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,830
You know better.

299
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:16,950
-You got some change?
-I'm straight.

300
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,230
What'd they say?

301
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,830
So, what's up?

302
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,280
Yeah. I'm ready.

303
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:54,360
We got a hair show to go
to up there, anyway.

304
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:01,720
What you mean, "a fine one"?
You trying to say I got ugly f riends?

305
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,030
I ain't got no ugly f riends.

306
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,360
You wanna talk about it?

307
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,870
I think you'll feel better
if you talk about it.

308
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:20,790
What the hell are they
doing out there now?

309
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,800
-I'll be glad when we get out of here.
-What's wrong?

310
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,150
What's wrong?

311
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:49,560
You got your styles together
f or the Oakland show?

312
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:54,680
Yeah, I'm just gonna work
on Dina and Gina's head a bit.

313
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:58,760
If they like it, they like it.
If they don't, they don't.

314
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:05,190
Will you ride with us? We got us a
little caravan going. We gonna party.

315
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:09,520
Oh, Justice. Look at your f ace.

316
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:13,720
Listen, I know I'm not your mama,
and I'm not trying to be...

317
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:17,000
...but I gotta tell you,
you got to move on.

318
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:21,520
A man is a tool. You got to know
when to take him out the box...

319
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:27,040
...and when to put him back in. If you
lose one, go get yourself another one.

320
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:31,320
Take a chance, baby.
Do something different f or a change.

321
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:35,000
There's another man
out there somewhere.

322
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:39,070
And out here, sometimes
you're gonna lose one.

323
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:43,960
Like a blow dryer or a good hairbrush.

324
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:51,280
What I got to do?
Play everybody's mama in this shop?

325
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,320
Hell, I got my own problems.

326
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:02,080
Okay, where's my brush?

327
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:06,360
I'm tired of my shit
disappearing around here.

328
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:15,280
Why you always borrowing
my shit without asking?

329
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:20,430
I asked you this morning if I could
borrow your brush, and you said yes...

330
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:24,920
...and I have returned it to you.
Why you gonna cry about it, Dexter?

331
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:29,600
-You sound like my little niece.
-Here we go again.

332
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,070
What's your new man talking about?

333
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:37,760
Girl, he want me to go on a run
with him. This is good.

334
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:41,200
I don't have to be messing
with it all the time.

335
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,710
-Just get up and go.
-You know, girl...

336
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,920
You're catching me
on the wrong goddamn day.

337
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,400
So you got balls?

338
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:54,200
I was All-City strong safety
at Dorsey High. I'll get in your ass.

339
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,200
And not the way
you want me to, Sexy Dex.

340
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,880
Please. Stop this right now.

341
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,960
-What's a " run"?
-You know what a run is.

342
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,720
I don't know what it is.
Stop messing with your head.

343
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,270
Now, what's a run?

344
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:15,790
A run? Well, it's like...
You really wanna know, girl?

345
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,640
If you don't stop playing with me...

346
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:22,200
Chicago, my boyf riend,
works at the post office...

347
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:25,120
...the one on Century and Van Ness.

348
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:30,270
Every so often, he and his f riend
drive this mail truck up to Oakland.

349
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,000
-J, you listening to me?
-Yeah, I'm listening.

350
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:37,710
Like I said, they drive
this mail truck to Oakland.

351
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:43,400
And sometimes I go with them.
And I was thinking...

352
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:46,200
You're not having it, huh?

353
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:51,200
I got your bitch. Okay?
I got your bitch.

354
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,960
-Calm down.
-What you wanna do?

355
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,270
Not here.

356
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:59,640
What you doing seeing a mailman?
They don't make no money.

357
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:03,270
What he gonna do f or you,
mail your bills f or f ree?

358
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,320
Why you don't ever wanna have
no f un no more?

359
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:10,680
The world's just a big place
f or us to go and f uck up in it.

360
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:14,520
You aonna end up beina an old maid.

361
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,200
Need help?

362
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,200
You offer help
when all I got is one bag.

363
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,880
There you go.

364
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,150
Put that cigarette out.
I don't allow smoking in here.

365
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:41,640
Come on, Ma, I pay the bills here
and I can't have a cigarette?

366
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:45,590
Shut the f uck up
and put the cigarette out!

367
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:51,590
-You going up north to see Kalil?
-Yeah.

368
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,480
I'm finally gonna work
on this music thing.

369
00:33:55,720 --> 00:34:00,000
Somebody could listen to our tape.
I ain't got to do this post office shit.

370
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:06,240
Don't be cussing around me, boy.
Be glad you got an honest job.

371
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:11,320
Don't go to Oakland every weekend.
You know how Aunt Audrey can get.

372
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:14,680
Ma, it ain't even like that.

373
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,400
Keisha here.

374
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:24,280
-Really? How's my grandbaby doing?
-Bad as ever.

375
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:31,870
I want her to stay with us f or good.
Angel been f ucking up, bad.

376
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:37,240
Basing. I can't have my baby
around that sh... Stuff.

377
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:41,880
Now, are you gonna take care of her?

378
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,840
Yeah.

379
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:49,750
Just remember, that's your baby.
I'm done raising kids.

380
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:56,240
Quit playing video games and figure out
what you gonna do with your life.

381
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,830
Packed my bags, my stuff...

382
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,470
Wait a second... White Boy.

383
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:54,160
Come on.

384
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,200
Shit!

385
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,950

00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:10,080

387
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:16,720
-Hello?

390
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:32,000

391
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:35,670
-We gonna have f un.
-I can't believe I'm doing this.

392
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,520
It's gonna be so on, just watch.

393
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:41,240
I ain't doing this.

394
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:46,360
Motherf ucker said she f rom Ethiopia.
Knew damn well that bitch f rom Compton.

395
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:50,840
-She look it, though.
-With a kid named Lamar?

396
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,720
Girl, you got this.
I ain't riding in that.

397
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,640
-Why you gotta be a buster?
-Who you calling a buster?

398
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,480
-You. Take a chance.
-Take a chance, my ass. Look at this!

399
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:03,880
She's fly, now, ain't she, Lucky?
Look, man.

400
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:07,480
-Oh, my God, I know that bitch.
-You don't know her.

401
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:13,400
That's that hoe that work
in the salon on 54th. Here we go.

402
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,400
She act up and her ass is out.

403
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,760
Lucky is cool, girl.
That's Lucky right there.

404
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:23,040
He was in the salon, trying to mack.

405
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,320
-Sorry-ass, bald-headed...
-Just be cool.

406
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:29,560
-You know him, girl?
-She better not act up...

407
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,600
Lucky, this is Justice.
Justice, this is Lucky.

408
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:36,040
-And you already know Chicago.
-What's up, baby?

409
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,520
-Baby?
-Shit. Hi.

410
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,560
Anyway, let's go. Move!

411
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:46,390
Damn. Watch out, girl.
Get your ass in the back.

412
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,560
Shit, I ain't no f ucking bellboy.

413
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,800
Take it easy on that mail!

414
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:57,040
Sit up here, girl.

415
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,000
Go ahead and
make your seat belts click, baby.

416
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:08,160
We f ollow all the safety guidelines
around these parts.

417
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,560
Y'all just hold on.

418
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,440
There you go. We out.

419
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:00,000
Stop. Stop.

420
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,350
You don't know
if you wanna kiss me or hit me.

421
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:09,720
-lt's your way of showing you like me.
-I don't.

422
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:12,160
-Yes, you do. I know what you like.
-What?

423
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:15,830
Man, shit. Muscle! Feel it!

424
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,880
Nigga, that ain't shit.

425
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,840
It ain't? What's that?

426
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,080
Shit, don't be grabbing
my titty like that.

427
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:29,000
-What you want me to do, kiss it?
-Yeah, here. Psych!

428
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,800
Stop, Chicago.

429
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:36,520
See? That's better.
Be nice f or a change.

430
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,320
Mind if I smoke?

431
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,520
Guess not.

432
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,280
You kind of quiet, huh?

433
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,590
I guess so.

434
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,600
I ain't got nothing to say.

435
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:57,040
Why you so mean?

436
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,080
What you got to be so mean about?

437
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:11,840
So you one of them angry bitches.
A feminist.

438
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,550
-What'd you call me?
-Said you a mean bitch.

439
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:19,150
We gotta stop this right now.
You don't know shit about me.

440
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,750
Don't be calling me no bitch.

441
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:27,320
I've been acting courteous. Nigga gotta
call you a bitch to get your attention.

442
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,830
I'm a black woman, okay?
I deserve respect.

443
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Don't be calling me no bitch.
If I'm a bitch, your mama's a bitch.

444
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:39,840
Save that " black woman" shit.
You bleed once a month like every hoe.

445
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,840
We ain't talking about my mama,
we talking about your stuck-up ass.

446
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:47,720
You think a nigga's supposed
to do magic tricks f or your ass.

447
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:51,960
-Pull this shit over right now.
-Where you gonna go?

448
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:54,960
I'll walk, motherf ucker.
Pull over.

449
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,960

-So, cousin, what's your name?

601
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:51,800
Just call me Cousin Pete.
That's right, Cousin Pete.

602
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:54,840
Come here.
I want y'all to meet some f amily.

603
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:57,040
Over here we got Aunt Jessica.

604
00:53:57,240 --> 00:54:02,270
Uncle Herb. Aunt Aida Pearl.
That's Uncle Fred and his wife, Wilma.

605
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:06,120
Cousin Isaac, Cousin James,
Cousin Kwame. What's up, bro?

606
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:10,400
And them kids, I don't know

607
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:15,040
Sitting over here, we got Aunt April,
we got Aunt May and Aunt June.

608
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:17,640
I call them the Calendar Sisters.

609
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:19,950
-Look at them.
-Ain't they pretty?

610
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:24,280
-How y'all doing?

612
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:30,640
Don't it? Go over and help yourself.
You f amily, ain't you?

613
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:33,600
-lt's cool?
-You better go get something.

614
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:37,390
Go ahead with him.
I'm gonna play some cards.

615
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:43,960
Bye. Look at them.
Don't they make such a cute couple?

616
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:57,440
-Are you all in love?
-Yeah.

617
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:02,080
Baby, what would you know about love?

618
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,000
Nothing.

619
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:07,240
How can you be in love
if you don't know nothing about it?

620
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:10,160
-Just the way things go.
-Are you married?

621
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:12,550
-Yeah.
-How long you been married?

622
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:16,200
About six months now.

623
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:20,600
I don't wear it all the time.

624
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:24,360
You don't mind
if she doesn't wear your ring?

625
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:25,750
He don't mind.

626
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:28,920
He can answer f or himself,
if he's a real man.

627
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:31,390
Well?

628
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:33,750
No, no. I don't mind.

629
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:37,160
My husband would kill me
if I didn't wear no ring.

630
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:41,240
-I heard that.
-And I know that's right.

631
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:47,150
-Damn, you greedy.
-Gotta eat to live.

632
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:50,280
Well, why you so skinny, then?

633
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:55,640
Look at the cute baby.
Can I hold her f or you?

634
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:01,000
Look at you. I heard that.
Give me a burp. That spittle?

635
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:04,120
You be dating them
professional men, huh?

636
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:07,520
Doctors, lawyers, pharmacists?

637
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:12,200
Street pharmacists?
I knew you was like that.

638
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:14,360
Here. I'll take her now.

639
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:17,800
She is so cute. You sure?
What's her name?

640
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:20,000
Her name is lmani.

641
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:26,240
Hi, lmani. Hi there.
You're so cute. Yes, you are.

642
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:31,720
-Thank you.
-Thank you, lmani.

643
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:38,080
So you got a kid, huh?

644
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:44,400
-Why you ask me that?
-Because you look like the type.

645
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:48,720
-And what's the type?
-I don't know.

646
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:52,120
This. You just walking by.
You the type.

647
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:54,640
Anyway...

648
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,480
You got any kids?

649
00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:01,240
Hell, no, I ain't got no kids.
I don't even like kids.

650
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:04,000
Sure don't look like that to me.

651
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:10,600
This here's kind of cool.

652
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:13,710
You ever been to one of these?

653
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:19,200
No, I ain't got much f amily.
Family I do have, we ain't this close.

654
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:24,360
I ain't never seen so many black f olks
in one spot and there ain't no fight.

655
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:33,920
Let's get back to these
street pharmacists you used to see.

656
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:37,320
Let me tell you something.
I only went out with one.

657
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:42,840
He was my first boyf riend,
my first love. He meant a lot to me.

658
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:49,230
-So you was in it f or the money?
-You're getting too damn personal.

659
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:58,000
What the f uck you know? You don't
even keep your f ucking nails clean.

660
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:06,840
I want to talk to you about morals.

661
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:12,160
The morals of the young people today
is gonna get them in big trouble.

662
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:16,080
Because they act like
they don't know the difference...

663
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,520
...between right and wrong.

664
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:23,040
This is the truth. And one
of the reasons is their parents.

665
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:25,800
Parents are not taking care
of the children.

666
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:29,840
They don't tell them the difference
between right and wrong.

667
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,160
Wait now. No, ma'am.
You have to listen.

668
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:37,160
Because part of the responsibility
is the children.

669
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:39,120
Because this is their life.

670
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:43,560
It's not their mama's or papa's.
They have to think f or themselves.

671
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:47,680
Even if their mama and papa
didn't do something about it...

672
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:52,470
...the children have to think
and try their best to come on up.

673
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:55,640
-Take this girl here.
-What about her?

674
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:59,760
That child ain't a bit more married
than the man in the moon.

675
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,920
-How you doing?
-Fine, how you doing?

676
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:07,920
She's flirting with another man.
Tell me she's married.

677
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:10,360
-She's young.
-She's loose.

678
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:12,960
She's not loose. You were young once.

679
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:16,320
Yeah, but I was never flitty.
I was never flitty.

680
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:18,360
She was never flitty.

681
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:26,830
I need to talk to my f riend.
What's wrong with you?

682
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:28,840
Chicago gonna kick your ass.

683
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:33,040
-You gonna play cards or sightsee?
-Chicago, come on.

684
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:37,720
-Chicago ain't gonna do shit.
-You stupid? He'll kick your ass.

685
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:43,040
-You're killing my action, girl. Stop.
-lesha, what action?

686
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:44,880
-What's up?
-She trippin'.

687
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:49,280
-She ain't doing nothing wrong.
-You got nothing to do with this.

688
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:52,120
-Calm down.
-She know what she's doing.

689
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:55,280
-Come on, girl.
-Wait, don't start nothing.

690
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:59,920
-I'm talking. I'm talking.
-Come on now, don't start fighting.

691
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:04,000
-What's wrong with you, man?
-I can't talk to nobody?

692
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:07,120
What's happening, man?

693
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:12,840
-You mind if I take some f ood to go?
-No, man. You go ahead.

694
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,920
-My cuz!
-Don't you worry.

695
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:19,440
Something don't look right over here.
I'm gonna have to get in this shit.

696
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:21,640
-Chicago, stop.
-Try to be cool.

697
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:24,920
-Gonna get his ass.
-We were just talking.

698
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:27,510
Get your hands off me. Shit.

699
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:29,640
-Fuck you.
-Get out of my f ace.

700
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:32,880
Why you gotta act up
every time we go someplace?

701
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:35,680
-Shut up.
-Why the f uck you gotta act up?

702
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:39,440
What's your problem?
Why the f uck you gotta disrespect me?

703
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:41,400
Fuck you. You don't own me.

704
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:44,840
Fuck you, bitch.
You and your drunk-ass pussy.

705
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:48,560
If I'm a bitch,
then why the f uck you with me?

706
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:52,430
-I don't know why.
-Then leave. Step the f uck off.

707
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:56,360
I don't keep no niggas
when they don't wanna be kept.

708
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:59,200
First of all, you don't keep shit.

709
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:01,670
All that talking.
Do that shit while you walking.

710
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:06,320
Pull over somewhere. I need
to talk to her. I'm sick of this shit.

711
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:09,240
I'm a black bastard now, right?
I wasn't when I bought you that shit.

712
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:13,440
You was a black bastard then,
and you a black f ucking bastard now.

713
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:16,600
-Why the f uck we stopping?
-Good, I gotta pee.

714
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:20,470
You know why you got to pee?
Because you drink too much.

715
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:23,600
Get your hands off me.
I'll pee on your motherf ucking ass.

716
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:27,600
Let me off this shit. I gotta pee.

717
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:31,640
Open the door.
You're gonna have some wet-ass mail.

718
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:33,920
Come here, lesha. I wanna talk to you.

719
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:38,840
What's wrong? Lucky f ucking
with you, huh? I'm gonna f uck you up.

720
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:44,030
-Girl, come here. I wanna talk to you.
-Let me put on my jacket.

721
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:53,920
Shit. Look at you.

722
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:58,440
What's up, J?
What's the problem, girl?

723
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:03,630
This is the problem. I'm sick of this.
You act like an alcoholic bitch.

724
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:07,270
-Why you calling me a bitch?
-All you do is get drunk.

725
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:11,400
That's why I never go anyplace
with you. You always acting crazy.

726
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:15,320
Just like my damn mama.

727
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:17,950
I'm sorry.

728
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:21,880
God, I'm sorry, J.

729
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:28,190
It's okay. It's gonna be all right.
You just gotta f reeze up on that shit.

730
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:32,840
I didn't know. I swear I didn't know.

731
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:37,200
You're my best f riend, though.
I don't wanna hurt you.

732
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:42,720
And I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

733
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:44,840
You just gotta stop.

734
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:49,000
I know. God, I know.

735
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:55,470
Look at me.

736
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:58,590
I gotta pee.

737
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:02,390
-You old cow, come on.
-You a cow!

738
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:05,400
You're right.
Shit don't change. I told you.

739
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:08,200
Can't give these hoes shit.
They try to break your back.

740
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:19,230
-Still mad at me?
-Come on, it's hot. What's up?

741
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:22,280
I'm sorry, Chicago.

742
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:26,590
-Hey, that's nice. Who's that?
-My cousin Kalil.

743
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:29,760
-That's real nice.
-He write all this shit.

744
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:35,080
I help him with ideas. I'm gonna go
to Oakland and work on this music.

745
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:38,040
It's all right, man.
It ain't all that.

746
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:43,840
Why you always got something negative
to say? At least the nigga's creative.

747
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,000
Fuck, he ain't creative.
I'm creative.

748
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:49,440
-What you do?
-I can dress.

749
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:53,720
That's just like a nigga to down-talk
a man 'cause he trying and you ain't.

750
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:57,400
You ain't shit. Post office worker.
No-union-ass nigga.

751
01:03:57,560 --> 01:03:59,440
-You work there too.
-I'm in the union.

752
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:04,000
That don't mean shit. You need a
f ashion tip, sweatshirt-wearing ass.

753
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:07,040
Why y'all always fighting?
I thought you were f riends.

754
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:09,840
-I just work with him.
-Fuck that nigga.

755
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,520
Can I get some air?
Breathing like a goddamn dragon.

756
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:15,910
Anyway...

757
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:26,950
Turn that shit up, man.

758
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:34,160
A wise man once said,
"Look at the ocean and realize...

759
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:38,800
... that no matter how famous you are
or how much money you make...

760
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:42,800
...know that you'll never be
as important as the ocean. "

761
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:45,110
Why didn't I ao to colleae?

762
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:50,390
Grandmamma would be rollina over in
her arave two times if she saw me now.

763
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:54,600
I wonder...

764
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:59,400
No, he probably aot babies and shit.
Look at him.

765
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:03,680
He looks just like the type that aot
a baby stashed away somewheres.

766
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:08,720
Damn, she kind of cute.
Got a nice little frame.

767
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:13,520
Maybe I should aet that number,
see how the booty work.

768
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:16,040
Wonder what Kalil doina.

769
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:20,200
I wonder if my mama picked up
my clothes from the cleaners.

770
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:22,960
I know what I aotta do
when I aet back.

771
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:28,400
I aotta call Terry with his fine ass.
Ask him to take me shoppina.

772
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:32,640
I need to just let her ass ao.
Fuck it.

773
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:37,640
I can just find me another bitch.
I'm a aood-lookina niaaa.

774
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:40,840
Got a job. Income comina in.

775
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:43,840
Car. Apartment.

776
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:47,120
My shit is set.

777
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:52,830
Girl, when I get back to L.A.,
I'm quitting Chicago.

778
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:55,880
His tired ass.

779
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:03,800
-lesha, I'm gonna go on a diet.
-A diet?

780
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:07,160
Yeah. My ass is getting too big.

781
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:11,280
I ain't never heard you talking
about going on no diet.

782
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:17,030
I get it. You happy-go-Lucky.

783
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:20,240
-Don't be even trying that shit.
-Yes, you are.

784
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:21,880
No, I don't play that.

785
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:26,640
Hear them drums?
Where that shit coming f rom?

786
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:29,240
Who gives a f uck? We ain't stopping.

787
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:59,920
They got some cute shirts over there.

788
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:06,110
What's wrong with you?
Why you so quiet now?

789
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:10,640
Just thinking. I don't really
get a chance to think in the city.

790
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:16,720
This be the only time I can unwind.
Or when I'm with my cousin.

791
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:19,960
I'm getting tired of all this walking.

792
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:21,920
Yeah, me too, Lucky.

793
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:28,760
What you write about in that notebook?

794
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:31,360
That's my poetry.

795
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:34,520
You trying to say
my cousin's shit ain't poetry?

796
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:39,000
It ain't if he ain't got nothing deep
to say. Gotta have a voice.

797
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:43,360
-A perspective.
-What do you write about?

798
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:46,640
Whatever's in my heart.

799
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:50,760
And what's that?

800
01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:01,440
I don't know. What's in yours?

801
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:05,640
I don't know.
Still trying to find out.

802
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:13,760
Niaaas are scared of revolution.
Niaaas are nothina but lovers.

803
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:17,600
Man, why we keep stopping?
We got a schedule to keep.

804
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:21,310
We got time. Why you trippin'?
We do this all the time.

805
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:27,080
Because we need to get where we got
to go. Your ass keep procrastinating.

806
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:31,400
You think you slick. Just trying
to gib to that bitch, that's all.

807
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:33,400
That's your f ucking problem.

808
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:35,630
-Fuck you, limp motherf ucker.
-What?

809
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:39,320
-I said, f uck you.
-You better check that bitch.

810
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:43,600
Shit. Gonna get me some plums.

811
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:49,520
You ain't gonna pull that.
She out of your league.

812
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:52,640
I'm getting tired of your black ass.

813
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:56,190
Man, f uck you.

814
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:58,760
Fuck all of them.

815
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:01,600
Don't need this shit
f ucking my day up.

816
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:05,000
But there's one thina about niaaas
I do not love.

817
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:08,320
Niaaas are scared of revolution.

818
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:17,150
Don't eat that. You ain't washed it.

819
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,760
-Yes, I did.
-Where?

820
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:26,320
-You're nasty.
-Want a bite?

821
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:32,040
I don't want none of that dirty plum.
Don't know whose hands been on it.

822
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:34,960
You know you want a bite.

823
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:53,560
-Wanna do something?
-What about them?

824
01:09:53,720 --> 01:09:56,160
-Fuck them.
-All right.

825
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:58,040
All right?

826
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:05,070
How many brothers
and sisters you got?

827
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:08,600
I ain't got no brothers and sisters.

828
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:12,710
My mama didn't have the chance
to have any more kids.

829
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:22,560
lesha. Oh, man.

830
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:31,280
Shit.

831
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:42,520
-ls that it?
-Give me a couple minutes, all right?

832
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:47,040
Fuck that. A couple minutes, my ass.
You can't even hang that long.

833
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:49,840
-Fuck you.
-That's the problem. You can't.

834
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:54,200
-You the motherf ucking problem.
-No, your dick's the problem.

835
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:57,640
Thought I'd give you something
bef ore I quit your ass...

836
01:10:57,800 --> 01:11:00,840
...but you can't even appreciate that.
Can't even do it right.

837
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,230
-Just shut the f uck up.
-Shut up?

838
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:04,600
Yeah. Shut up.

839
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:07,760
You must be embarrassed.
Is that what it is?

840
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:11,880
Shut the f uck up, all right?
I'm getting sick of this shit.

841
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:15,880
-Don't come near me.
-What you mean, don't come near you?

842
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:18,960
-Get out of my f ace.
-How you just gonna leave?

843
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:21,880
You know why I left.
Don't even ask me that.

844
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:25,040
-I don't. Tell me why you left.
-You know why.

845
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:30,040
-You need to take your time and relax.
-You need to. You got the problem.

846
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:33,560
-I ain't got no goddamn problem.
-You got a problem.

847
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:35,920
Look, don't turn your back on me.

848
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:38,920
-Don't touch me.
-Don't turn your back on me.

849
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:40,720
-I need to.
-Why?

850
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:45,640
'Cause that's the reason the other
bitch left you. You can't hang.

851
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:47,400
-I can't hang?
-You can't hang.

852
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:51,560
-That's a f ucked-up thing to say.
-lt's a real thing to say.

853
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:55,080
That's what I get f or f ucking with
bitches like you. Y'all don't give a f uck.

854
01:11:55,240 --> 01:11:58,080
-I don't give a f uck about you.
-No, you don't.

855
01:11:58,240 --> 01:12:02,360
I had many niggas that
bought me better shit than you.

856
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:05,120
-Fuck you.
-Listen to what I got to say.

857
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:07,750
-Don't touch me.
-Listen to me, then.

858
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:09,880
What do I need to listen to?

859
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:13,120
How come my shit can't be all like this,
beautif ul and shit? You f ucked it up.

860
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:16,830
-You ain't a beautif ul motherf ucker.
-That's f ucked up.

861
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,520
-I'm tired of arguing.
-Shut up.

862
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:23,470
-Don't turn away f rom me.
-You know what? You weak.

863
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:25,400
You a weak-ass punk.

864
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:29,440
You think you the shit because
you work out? You ain't buff.

865
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:34,120
I wish I never met your sorry ass.
You a sorry motherf ucker.

866
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:37,880
Yeah, that's right.
Brush that weak-ass f ade.

867
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:40,480
Nigga's dick can't
stay hard 5 minutes.

868
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:44,320
What the f uck you do, take steroids?

869
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:51,240
That's the reason why
I'm f ucking somebody else.

870
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:18,360
Motherf ucker!
What the f uck do you want?

871
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:20,990
-Calm down.
-You guys stop fighting!

872
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:23,760
-Don't fight with me.
-Leave her alone!

873
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:27,920
-You ain't gonna do nothing?
-Hell, no. That's their business.

874
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:32,000
-Get off me!
-Shit. You bitch!

875
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:36,840
-How much shit I gotta take off you?
-Get the f uck off of her!

876
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:39,840
Shit!

877
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:45,160
Hey, motherf ucker!

878
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:49,320
-You ain't got shit to do with this.
-Get the f uck off me.

879
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:52,360
-Get the f uck off her. You all right?
-Yeah.

880
01:13:52,520 --> 01:13:55,680
-What's wrong with you?
-What's your problem?

881
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:59,440
-She hit me.
-You can't handle it better than that?

882
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:03,390
I'm gonna get Dooky and Monster
to shoot your f ucking ass.

883
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:07,640
-They ain't gonna do shit.
-I told you to handle this shit.

884
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:12,880
-Shit wouldn't have been f ucked up.
-You just want some pussy, that's all.

885
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:15,280
Fuck!

886
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:18,910
-Get your punk ass up.
-Fucker.

887
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:26,680
You little punk.
Coward motherf ucker. Hit a man.

888
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:34,750
Find a f ucking bus, you little punk.
I'm leaving your ass!

889
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:38,550
Don't leave me. Leave them hoes.

890
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:43,400
Walk your ass the 15 miles
to Oakland. Get the f uck off my shit!

891
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:46,440
-But we got a job.
-Get the f uck off my shit!

892
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:48,440
Leave them hoes.

893
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:50,800
Yo, hold on, Lucky.

894
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:55,200
Hey, leave them hoes, man.

895
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:13,880
Shit.

896
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:19,760
Oh, boy.
This ain't my motherf ucking day.

897
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:26,800
I can't believe he hit me.

898
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:30,080
Tired ass.

899
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:36,080
He gonna get f ucked up, watch.

900
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:41,030
Is it true the ribs can tell the kick
Of a beast from a lover's fist?

901
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:44,320
The bruised bones record it well

902
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:47,480
The sudden shock, the hard impact

903
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:49,440
Then swollen lids

904
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:54,040
Sorry eyes spoke not of lost romance
But of hurt

905
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:56,160
Hate is often confused

906
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:59,240
Its limits are in zones beyond itself

907
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:02,240
And sadists will not learn that

908
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:07,190
Love, by nature, extracts a pain
Unequalled on the rack

909
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:10,080
Why are we stopped?

910
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:14,800
I don't know. I'll find out, though.

911
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:30,960
They was gonna break up anyway.

912
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:45,160
I remember when I was little...

913
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:49,150
...and my uncle Leon
used to come around.

914
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:54,960
He used to give me
and my cousins change.

915
01:17:58,040 --> 01:18:01,960
He'd go to the liquor store
and buy a 40-ounce of beer.

916
01:18:02,120 --> 01:18:05,160
Always throw us the change.

917
01:18:08,440 --> 01:18:12,150
I'd always ask f or the big nickel.

918
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:16,960
I couldn't pronounce "quarter, "
so that's what I called it.

919
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:31,040
Look at your nails.
Give me your hand.

920
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:34,360
Come on, give me your hand.

921
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:42,480
Anyway, so because of that,
my grandmamma used to say...

922
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:46,560
...I was always looking
f or the big nickel.

923
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:57,800
-That's bef ore she died.
-When did she die?

924
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:02,160
About two years ago.

925
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:06,160
She left me the house.

926
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:20,350
When I was 12,
my mama committed suicide.

927
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:32,280
She named me Justice
because she was in law school...

928
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:35,800
...when she was pregnant with me.

929
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:45,560
I'm all alone now, though.

930
01:19:47,720 --> 01:19:52,350
I got a cat. Cute little cat.

931
01:19:53,240 --> 01:19:54,960
Damn.

932
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:18,430
Give me your hand

933
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:23,390
Make room for me to lead and follow you
Beyond this raae of poetry

934
01:21:23,560 --> 01:21:26,400
Let others have privacy
Of touchina words

935
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:28,760
And love of loss of love

936
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:32,960
For me, aive me your hand

937
01:21:43,160 --> 01:21:46,160
Look, I gotta tell you something.

938
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:54,280
Shit, don't tell me you got something.

939
01:21:54,440 --> 01:21:59,200
No. I'm only telling you this
because I care about you...

940
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:03,150
...and I think you should know
bef ore we go any f urther.

941
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:29,720
A little girl, huh?

942
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:34,040
Why didn't you tell me
in the beginning?

943
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:40,040
I mean, how was I supposed
to know what we was doing?

944
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:45,160
I'm gonna go check on my cousin.

945
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:56,640
Aunt Audrey. Kalil.

946
01:22:56,800 --> 01:23:00,760
Aunt Audrey. Kalil.

947
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:23,560
Hey, where do you think you're going?

948
01:23:24,440 --> 01:23:27,960
-Kalil!
-Shit, man, it's his cousin!

949
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:33,640
-Yo, man, somebody shot Kalil.
-Who shot him?

950
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:37,360
What relationship is
this woman to him?

951
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:42,760
Just get away f rom me, man!

952
01:23:43,640 --> 01:23:48,160
Cover him up, man! Cover him up!
What the f uck are you doing?

953
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:30,870
-What's up? What room we in?
-What happened to you?

954
01:25:40,640 --> 01:25:42,840
Don't touch me.

955
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:46,920
If I had got there on time,
this never would have happened.

956
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:51,360
Instead of f ucking with you.

957
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:54,720
What?

958
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:41,560
So we scraping the bottom
of the pudding cup now, huh?

959
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:46,040
Know what you talking about
bef ore you judge.

960
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:49,360
Well, ex cuse me. I'm sorry.

961
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:54,750
You even walk different.

962
01:26:56,960 --> 01:27:02,680
Let's go, fellas, all right?
I don't got all day. Watch your head.

963
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:05,560
I thought there was gonna
be two of you.

964
01:27:07,200 --> 01:27:09,760
No, it's just me.

965
01:27:10,360 --> 01:27:14,280
-See you the next time around.
-No, I don't think so.

966
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:19,160
You don't fight no man with your fist.
You fight him in his wallet.

967
01:27:19,320 --> 01:27:24,080
Instead of swinging at him,
you should have gave him some.

968
01:27:24,240 --> 01:27:28,000
Wait till he went to sleep
and took that credit card.

969
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:31,360
-And we all would have had a party.
-On him!

970
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:35,400
What credit card?
That nigga ain't got no credit card.

971
01:27:35,560 --> 01:27:38,560
-No credit cards?
-Shit, then you is a f ool.

972
01:28:34,720 --> 01:28:38,160
-I'm telling you, men ain't shit.
-Ain't that the truth.

973
01:28:38,360 --> 01:28:41,520
Ex cuse me?
I thought you were in love.

974
01:28:41,680 --> 01:28:45,470
Well, you thought wrong.
Don't be assuming shit, okay?

975
01:28:45,640 --> 01:28:48,880
When you assume,
you make an ass out of you.

976
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:53,720
Well, you were already an ass.
You got a lot to learn about the world.

977
01:28:55,200 --> 01:28:59,360
Come on, y'all.
Let's go get a drink.

978
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:03,760
These little girls don't know
their cooch f rom a hole in the wall.

979
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:06,800
-But they gonna learn.
-You got that right.

980
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:10,840
'Cause all I do is dress and rest.

981
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:15,120
-'Cause love don't live here anymore.
-Come on, Jessie.

982
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:14,960
Morning, Lawrence. You hungry, baby?
Come here and get something to eat.

983
01:30:15,200 --> 01:30:17,560
I ain't hungry.

984
01:30:18,040 --> 01:30:20,760
Too mad to eat.

985
01:30:22,040 --> 01:30:27,160
Audrey. Audrey, sit down. Sit down.
You gonna wear yourself out.

986
01:30:42,120 --> 01:30:44,160
Lawrence.

987
01:30:48,240 --> 01:30:51,480
Shante, check that chicken, baby.

988
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:54,360
Make sure it don't burn.

989
01:30:58,040 --> 01:30:59,760
Lawrence.

990
01:31:01,240 --> 01:31:05,440
I want you to know,
you my f avourite nephew.

991
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:11,550
Your mama and l, even though we're
sisters, we don't always get along.

992
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:17,440
But I was always happy that
you and Kalil were like brothers.

993
01:31:18,160 --> 01:31:21,840
Family's got to stick together,
no matter what.

994
01:31:25,400 --> 01:31:30,680
Aunt Audrey, I know you're probably
not thinking about this right now.

995
01:31:30,840 --> 01:31:33,960
Probably ain't important to y'all.

996
01:31:36,720 --> 01:31:39,760
But it's important to me...

997
01:31:40,600 --> 01:31:43,960
...to know what you're gonna do
with the equipment.

998
01:31:44,120 --> 01:31:46,640
We gonna sell it. We need the money.

999
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:49,400
Why don't you mind your business?

1000
01:31:49,560 --> 01:31:53,960
He put every dollar he had into that
equipment. You just gonna f uck it up?

1001
01:31:54,160 --> 01:31:57,400
-Watch your mouth.
-I'm serious. You know he did.

1002
01:31:57,560 --> 01:32:00,560
What you think we should do?

1003
01:32:02,160 --> 01:32:06,720
Give it to me.
I'll do something with it.

1004
01:32:07,120 --> 01:32:10,040
I'll do what he would
have wanted me to do.:

1005
01:32:10,240 --> 01:32:12,360
Use it.

1006
01:32:12,920 --> 01:32:16,840
Tell Annie I said " hi." And I love you.

1007
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,360
I love you too.

1008
01:33:26,640 --> 01:33:29,280
Pretty women wonder
Where my secret lies

1009
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:32,960
I'm not cute
Or built to suit a fashion model's size

1010
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:37,280
But when I start to tell them
They think I'm tellina lies

1011
01:33:37,440 --> 01:33:41,640
I say, it's the reach of my arms
The span of my hips

1012
01:33:41,800 --> 01:33:44,840
The stride of my step
The curl of my lips

1013
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:50,360
I'm a woman, phenomenally
Phenomenal woman, that's me

1014
01:33:50,520 --> 01:33:53,990
I walk into a room
Just as cool as you please

1015
01:33:54,160 --> 01:33:59,030
And to a man, the fellows stand
Or they fall down to their knees

1016
01:33:59,200 --> 01:34:02,590
Then they swarm around me
Like a hive of honey bees

1017
01:34:02,760 --> 01:34:07,470
I say, it's the fire in my eyes
The flash of my teeth

1018
01:34:07,640 --> 01:34:10,880
The swina in my waist
And the joy in my feet

1019
01:34:11,040 --> 01:34:16,120
I'm a woman, phenomenally
Phenomenal woman, that's me

1020
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:22,760
-Damn!
-Daddy, could we go to the store?

1021
01:34:23,160 --> 01:34:26,790
Go in the living room.
It's too dangerous in here.

1022
01:34:28,760 --> 01:34:31,960
Men themselves have wondered
What they see in me

1023
01:34:32,120 --> 01:34:36,640
They try so much
But they can't touch my inner mystery

1024
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:40,680
When I try to show them
They still can't see

1025
01:34:40,840 --> 01:34:45,040
I say, it's the arch of my back
The sun of my smile

1026
01:34:45,200 --> 01:34:48,440
The ride of my breasts
And the arace of my style

1027
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:55,080
I'm a woman, phenomenally
Phenomenal woman, that's me

1028
01:35:17,560 --> 01:35:20,640
Now you understand
Just why my head's not bowed

1029
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:24,800
I don't have to shout or jump about
Or have to talk real loud

1030
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:28,480
When you see me passina
It ouaht to make you proud

1031
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:33,080
I say, it's the click of my heels
The bend of my hair

1032
01:35:33,240 --> 01:35:36,480
The palm of my hand
The need for my care

1033
01:35:36,640 --> 01:35:42,560
I'm a woman, phenomenally
Phenomenal woman, that's me

1034
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:04,560
Don't look at me.

1035
01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:11,870
Look at her. Sitting over there
in that cheap dress.

1036
01:36:12,040 --> 01:36:15,830
-Acting like she don't know you.
-She know who I am.

1037
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:19,040
-Plastic Payless shoes.
-Cheap-ass weave.

1038
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:23,960
Ain't even human hair.
The bitch got yak hair in her head.

1039
01:36:24,120 --> 01:36:26,720
Is there a problem?

1040
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:29,600
If you don't quit staring,
I'm gonna slap you.

1041
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:33,840
We're not having that here.
You take it to the street.

1042
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:37,550
-We could take it out.
-Don't you mess with my man!

1043
01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:41,880
Remember this: Every time
you kiss him, you tasting my pussy.

1044
01:36:42,040 --> 01:36:45,750
-You got to go!
-That's wrong.

1045
01:36:45,960 --> 01:36:49,920
-Please, darling, cool it down.
-She need to whup her ass.

1046
01:36:50,080 --> 01:36:52,550
None of that!

1047
01:36:52,760 --> 01:36:55,760
I'm kind of tired too.
Watch yourself.

1048
01:36:57,440 --> 01:36:59,750
What's up?

1049
01:37:04,160 --> 01:37:08,160
-How much is it? Twenty-five?
-Yeah.

01:37:27,240 --> 01:37:31,360
-Can we sit down f or a few minutes?
-Yeah, sure.

1054
01:37:35,200 --> 01:37:39,160
-She's so cute.
-This is my baby.

1055
01:37:42,520 --> 01:37:43,430
Look...

1056
01:37:48,360 --> 01:37:51,600
It took me a long time
to come down here.

1057
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:56,440
I mean, I know I made a mistake.

1058
01:37:56,600 --> 01:37:59,360
But everybody make mistakes.

1059
01:38:01,560 --> 01:38:04,560
And I had a lot on my mind.

1060
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:07,560
I'm sorry.

1061
01:38:08,640 --> 01:38:11,480
I apologize.

1062
01:38:11,640 --> 01:38:13,950
Forgive me?

1063
01:38:16,040 --> 01:38:18,510
Come here.
I wanna whisper something to you.

1064
01:38:18,680 --> 01:38:22,800
Get the f uck out of here.
I ain't f alling f or that again.

1065
01:38:23,640 --> 01:38:26,240
No, f or real, though. Come here.

1066
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:29,320
Come here. Come here.

1067
01:38:37,160 --> 01:38:39,120
Oh, my God!

1068
01:38:45,800 --> 01:38:48,760
Your nails are clean.

1069
01:38:49,320 --> 01:38:53,600
-I wonder why.
-They living a f airy tale.

1070
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:57,000
-What are y'all looking at?
-I wouldn't have f orgiven you.

1071
01:38:57,160 --> 01:38:59,880
-What have you done with her head?
-Nothing.

1072
01:39:00,040 --> 01:39:04,040
That's just what it look like too.
Come on, let me fix your hair.

1073
01:39:04,200 --> 01:39:07,560
-Her hair look fine.
-Come on. It's a mess.

1074
01:39:07,760 --> 01:39:12,630
-I guess my assumption was right.
-Ain't wearing black no more either.

1075
01:39:12,800 --> 01:39:16,480
They make an all right couple.
But he's not my type.

1076
01:39:16,640 --> 01:39:21,350
-Kind of cute, though.
-Nice nose.

1077
01:39:21,560 --> 01:39:25,160
There's a few things
we could do with your hair.

1078
01:39:25,320 --> 01:39:30,640
We can put some ponytails in it
and huge flower ribbons. Or barrettes.

1079
01:39:30,840 --> 01:39:36,240
Or we can put
some big, big, big curls in it.

1080
01:39:36,400 --> 01:39:40,080
Big locks.
Which way would you like it?

1081
01:39:40,240 --> 01:39:43,870
-Curls.
-You like the curls? The curls, okay.

1082
01:39:44,040 --> 01:39:47,320
-Do you go to school, Keisha?
-Yeah.

1083
01:39:47,480 --> 01:39:50,680
-You do? You like school?
-Yeah.

1084
01:39:50,840 --> 01:39:53,600
-What's your teacher's name?
-Mrs. Frazier.

1085
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:55,680
Mrs. Frazier?
