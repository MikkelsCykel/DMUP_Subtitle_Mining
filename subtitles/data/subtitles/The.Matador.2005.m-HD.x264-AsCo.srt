Two Mexicans walk into a cantina.

331
00:23:18,098 --> 00:23:21,267
One's a midget, and the other's got
a dick 15 inches long.

The midget says to the bartender,

"They call my amigo
the human swizzle stick.

call me?"

491
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,164
- You're a hit man?
- Oh, please.

492
00:31:43,248 --> 00:31:46,375
Please. My handler...

493
00:31:46,417 --> 00:31:48,585
...calls me a facilitator.

494
00:31:48,627 --> 00:31:51,128
A facilitator of fatalities.

495
00:31:51,213 --> 00:31:52,880
That's insane.

496
00:31:52,923 --> 00:31:54,299
Think what you like.

497
00:31:54,382 --> 00:31:56,091
I gotta hand it to ya, Julian,

498
00:31:56,175 --> 00:31:59,802
you're one of the best bullshit artists
I've met, and I've met some.

499
00:31:59,886 --> 00:32:03,013
You're absolutely right, Danny.
My name is Earl Johnson.

500
00:32:03,097 --> 00:32:05,682
I sell aluminum siding
in Minneapolis.

501
00:32:08,602 --> 00:32:12,271
- You actually kill people for a living?
- I do what I'm asked to do.

502
00:32:12,355 --> 00:32:13,856
What makes sense to me.

503
00:32:13,939 --> 00:32:15,773
For like, the Mob?

504
00:32:15,857 --> 00:32:18,567
I tend to be hired
on the more kind of

505
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:21,278
anonymous high-paying jobs.

506
00:32:21,362 --> 00:32:23,280
Oorporate gigs.

507
00:32:24,781 --> 00:32:26,740
Oorporate gigs?

508
00:32:26,783 --> 00:32:30,202
I'm a great helper
in getting deals closed.

509
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,790
I don't believe you.
I don't believe you.

510
00:32:36,832 --> 00:32:40,501
- I don't believe in the Easter Bunny.
- I don't believe you.

511
00:32:40,585 --> 00:32:42,544
Oome on! Oorporate gigs.

512
00:32:42,629 --> 00:32:44,463
- Think what you will.
- Ridiculous.

513
00:32:44,547 --> 00:32:46,006
- Yes!
- Oorporate gigs.

514
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:48,466
Yes! My God...

515
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:51,885
I knew there was a reason
I never told anyone what I did.

516
00:32:51,969 --> 00:32:53,636
Uh-huh.

517
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:55,638
All right, see that guy over there?

518
00:32:55,681 --> 00:32:57,599
- Fat man and little girl?
- Yeah.

519
00:32:57,641 --> 00:32:59,392
Say I wanted him dead.

520
00:32:59,475 --> 00:33:02,268
I want him dead, his family dead.
Dead. Right now.

521
00:33:02,311 --> 00:33:04,562
- Right here.
- Right now? Oouldn't happen.

522
00:33:04,646 --> 00:33:06,647
I know, but say that it could.

523
00:33:06,689 --> 00:33:08,190
- Money's no object.
- OK.

524
00:33:08,274 --> 00:33:11,151
- You sure you wanna know?
- Yeah.

525
00:33:11,193 --> 00:33:12,860
- Yeah, you sure?
- Yeah.

526
00:33:12,944 --> 00:33:15,112
I want you to facilitate it.

527
00:33:16,405 --> 00:33:18,072
OK, Danny.

528
00:33:18,157 --> 00:33:19,616
All right, come with me.

529
00:33:19,658 --> 00:33:21,534
- Huh?
- Let's go.

530
00:33:23,286 --> 00:33:25,662
[Crowd] Olél

531
00:33:25,746 --> 00:33:28,122
Olél

532
00:33:28,165 --> 00:33:31,459
Olél

533
00:33:31,501 --> 00:33:33,377
Olél

534
00:33:34,628 --> 00:33:38,172
I'm a big fan of the gotta-pee theory
of assassinations.

535
00:33:38,256 --> 00:33:40,049
Gotta pee?

536
00:33:40,133 --> 00:33:41,675
Everyone's gotta pee.

537
00:33:41,717 --> 00:33:43,176
Ah.

538
00:33:43,218 --> 00:33:44,844
Now...

539
00:33:44,928 --> 00:33:46,846
...ask me for a cigarette.

540
00:33:46,888 --> 00:33:49,431
- What?
- Do it.

541
00:33:49,515 --> 00:33:51,433
Oan I have a cigarette, please?

542
00:33:51,517 --> 00:33:55,019
Sure. But these things'll
kill ya, you know. [laughs]

543
00:33:56,854 --> 00:33:58,521
Now, look around.

544
00:34:00,774 --> 00:34:01,858
[Coughs]

545
00:34:01,942 --> 00:34:03,568
They're scary.

546
00:34:03,651 --> 00:34:05,527
- Yes and no.
- Why?

547
00:34:05,569 --> 00:34:08,362
They seem more interested
in the beautiful women

548
00:34:08,447 --> 00:34:10,531
coming and going
from the ladies' room.

549
00:34:10,573 --> 00:34:11,782
That's good for us.

550
00:34:11,866 --> 00:34:14,826
Just like those men over there
at the concession stand.

551
00:34:14,868 --> 00:34:16,535
They're only interested in us

552
00:34:16,578 --> 00:34:19,371
if they see us walking over
with our wallets open.

553
00:34:19,414 --> 00:34:21,874
No one is watching
the men's room.

554
00:34:21,957 --> 00:34:23,416
The gotta-pee theory.

555
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,709
You're catching on.

556
00:34:24,751 --> 00:34:26,877
Now, escape routes.

557
00:34:26,961 --> 00:34:29,504
- Escape routes?
- Don't wanna get caught, right?

558
00:34:29,547 --> 00:34:31,006
Don't get caught, it sucks.

559
00:34:31,048 --> 00:34:32,424
- See the main exit?
- Yeah.

560
00:34:32,507 --> 00:34:33,799
That's a traffic jam.

561
00:34:33,884 --> 00:34:36,552
- Where else?
- You tell me.

562
00:34:36,594 --> 00:34:37,719
OK, OK.

563
00:34:37,803 --> 00:34:39,637
Uh, that door over there.

564
00:34:39,722 --> 00:34:41,348
If it... if it weren't locked.

565
00:34:41,390 --> 00:34:44,559
Vietnamese girl I once knew
had her legs so locked together

566
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,726
I couldn't get a whiff
of her spring roll.

567
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:50,896
Two drinks, half a Quaalude later,
I was at an all-you-can eat buffet.

568
00:34:50,939 --> 00:34:52,773
Every lock can be broken.

569
00:34:52,857 --> 00:34:55,984
It's just a matter of will
and whether it's worth it.

570
00:34:58,153 --> 00:35:01,322
This looks like it's worth it.

571
00:35:01,405 --> 00:35:03,323
[Julian] Uno cigarillos, por favor.

572
00:35:03,407 --> 00:35:06,325
Why are we buying the cigarettes?

573
00:35:06,409 --> 00:35:08,285
'Oause I wanna smoke.

574
00:35:08,369 --> 00:35:09,411
Gracias.

575
00:35:09,495 --> 00:35:11,663
Oome over here.

576
00:35:11,747 --> 00:35:14,457
Now do your shoelaces up.

577
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,005
What time's our flight
to Florida, Seymour?

578
00:35:24,257 --> 00:35:26,467
I think 2:00, Derrick.

579
00:35:30,845 --> 00:35:32,929
Let's go, Seymour.

580
00:35:43,564 --> 00:35:45,440
[Cheering]

581
00:35:58,284 --> 00:35:59,785
Holy shit!

582
00:35:59,827 --> 00:36:01,828
[Chuckles]

583
00:36:27,974 --> 00:36:30,058
[Crowd cheering]

584
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:45,487
- You ready?
- Ready for what?

585
00:36:45,571 --> 00:36:47,322
You wanted to see
what I do, right?

586
00:36:47,406 --> 00:36:49,616
Yes.

587
00:36:49,658 --> 00:36:51,367
Yes, I've been watching.

588
00:36:51,451 --> 00:36:54,453
- But, you know...
- What? Show-and-tell is over.

589
00:36:54,495 --> 00:36:56,788
The real deal is about to start.

590
00:36:56,830 --> 00:36:58,831
- The real deal?
- Mm-hm.

591
00:37:01,042 --> 00:37:02,835
Show-and-tell is for sissies.

592
00:37:02,877 --> 00:37:04,670
But a sissy I'm not.

593
00:37:06,588 --> 00:37:08,547
- Oome on!
- My God, fire!

594
00:37:08,631 --> 00:37:11,007
- Oome on. It's a distraction.
- Are you crazy?

595
00:37:11,092 --> 00:37:14,594
Fire or tits, either one will
distract most cops.

596
00:37:14,678 --> 00:37:16,804
Are you ready to finish
what we started?

597
00:37:16,846 --> 00:37:19,639
That was extremely dangerous.
You proved your point.

598
00:37:19,682 --> 00:37:20,974
Baloney! Baloney!

599
00:37:21,016 --> 00:37:23,434
The cops may have
gone towards the fire,

600
00:37:23,518 --> 00:37:26,728
- but his bodyguard probably stood firm.
- Bodyguard?

601
00:37:26,812 --> 00:37:29,022
If I'm asked to kill,
they have a bodyguard.

602
00:37:29,106 --> 00:37:30,982
If they didn't, they'd ask you.

603
00:37:31,024 --> 00:37:33,442
So I slit the guard's throat
in one move,

604
00:37:33,526 --> 00:37:35,694
push him into the bathroom...

605
00:37:35,736 --> 00:37:38,029
And now we're set up for the kill.

606
00:37:42,908 --> 00:37:44,951
Where the hell
did you get the knife?

607
00:37:45,035 --> 00:37:47,370
He's not peeing,
so it must be number dos.

608
00:37:47,454 --> 00:37:49,830
OK, joke's over.
Point made, Julian.

609
00:37:49,872 --> 00:37:52,373
- Not yet. Not yet.
- Point made.

610
00:37:52,458 --> 00:37:54,709
The point's made.
Let's get out of here...

611
00:37:54,793 --> 00:37:57,753
Don't fuckin' ruin things,
OK? Don't do it.

612
00:38:04,676 --> 00:38:06,260
OK. Julian?

613
00:38:06,344 --> 00:38:08,554
I'm asking you to stop this!

614
00:38:08,637 --> 00:38:10,179
No way, job's not done.

615
00:38:10,222 --> 00:38:11,472
But this is not a job!

616
00:38:11,556 --> 00:38:13,974
You said money was no object!

617
00:38:15,518 --> 00:38:17,144
# Bingo was his name-o #

618
00:38:17,227 --> 00:38:18,728
- This is want you wanted?
- No!

619
00:38:18,812 --> 00:38:20,605
- You helped me.
- I didn't help you!

620
00:38:20,688 --> 00:38:21,938
Oh, yes, you did!

621
00:38:22,023 --> 00:38:23,690
- Oh, yes, you did!
- No! No, no.

622
00:38:27,068 --> 00:38:28,610
Oh, God, no!

623
00:38:31,155 --> 00:38:33,365
Oh! Disculpa me, por favor.

624
00:38:33,407 --> 00:38:34,783
Lo siento.

625
00:38:39,036 --> 00:38:40,078
Fun, huh?

626
00:38:40,121 --> 00:38:42,039
[Laughing]

627
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:45,124
Oome on. [laughing]

628
00:38:45,208 --> 00:38:48,126
[Danny] Whoo-hoo!
That was incredible!

629
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:51,087
- You scared the hell out of me!
- You liked that. You did?

630
00:38:51,171 --> 00:38:53,923
- I really bought it!
- What, that I'd stab a stranger?

631
00:38:54,007 --> 00:38:55,633
[Laughing] I don't know.

632
00:38:55,716 --> 00:38:58,468
Just like that?
A complete stranger?

633
00:38:58,552 --> 00:39:00,178
Well, yes!
Yes, I did.

634
00:39:00,261 --> 00:39:02,137
- I'm not psychotic.
- No, I know.

635
00:39:02,221 --> 00:39:05,723
- Psychopathic, not psychotic.
- I don't think you're a psychopath.

636
00:39:05,766 --> 00:39:08,935
Well, I kill people. Doesn't that
seem a wee bit psychopathic?

637
00:39:09,018 --> 00:39:10,519
Well, yeah, but...

638
00:39:10,603 --> 00:39:12,729
- Don't get the wrong impression.
- Huh?

639
00:39:12,771 --> 00:39:15,606
Because we share a laugh
doesn't mean I'm not unsavory.

640
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:18,400
No, what you do is unsavory.

641
00:39:18,443 --> 00:39:20,986
You know what they say.
You are what you do.

642
00:39:37,499 --> 00:39:39,250
Gracias.

643
00:39:39,292 --> 00:39:40,668
Gracias.

644
00:39:42,295 --> 00:39:44,463
Tell me...

645
00:39:46,173 --> 00:39:49,550
...will Bean stay with you if
this job doesn't come through?

646
00:39:50,343 --> 00:39:52,469
- What?
- Will Bean stay with you

647
00:39:52,553 --> 00:39:55,847
if you continue this losing streak
without any end?

648
00:39:55,931 --> 00:39:58,099
If she ever left me
I'd fall apart...

649
00:39:58,141 --> 00:40:01,018
You're not answering my question.

650
00:40:03,186 --> 00:40:05,687
To be quite honest...

651
00:40:06,356 --> 00:40:09,316
...I don't know how much faith
the woman has left in her.

[Sighs] Hey.

00:40:13,445 --> 00:40:14,987
Hey.

655
00:40:19,825 --> 00:40:23,327
- Hey.
- Let's change the subject. Please.

656
00:40:23,369 --> 00:40:24,995
- I agree.
- Something sunnier.

657
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:26,496
Sunnier.

658
00:40:27,289 --> 00:40:29,123
Absolutely.

659
00:40:29,165 --> 00:40:31,458
There's something
I wanted to talk about.

660
00:40:31,501 --> 00:40:33,335
- It's a favor, really.
- Sure.

661
00:40:33,419 --> 00:40:35,378
It's big, if that's OK.
A big favor.

662
00:40:35,462 --> 00:40:36,587
No, it's OK.

663
00:40:36,671 --> 00:40:39,214
See, the thing is...

664
00:40:39,298 --> 00:40:41,132
...I could use your help.

665
00:40:41,175 --> 00:40:42,968
Help in what?

666
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:44,469
I'm down here,

667
00:40:44,678 --> 00:40:47,722
I finished my otherjob early,
so I let it be known.

668
00:40:47,805 --> 00:40:49,264
You let it be known?

669
00:40:49,348 --> 00:40:52,767
Yeah, to the powers that be,
that I was available.

670
00:40:52,851 --> 00:40:55,061
- The powers that be?
- Yeah.

671
00:40:55,144 --> 00:40:58,396
Anyway, they called me up.
An urgent thing. Has to happen today.

672
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,856
An-anotherjob?

673
00:41:00,941 --> 00:41:02,191
Mm-hm.

The thing is, I could
really use your help.

Oh! [laughs]

You're kidding right now.

I'm as serious
as an erection problem.

- I mean, I...
- Gracias.

680
00:41:19,914 --> 00:41:22,457
I can't help you, Julian.

681
00:41:22,541 --> 00:41:23,917
You could.

682
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,667
Well, I could, but I-I can't,

683
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:27,794
I'm not gonna help
kill an innocent man.

684
00:41:27,879 --> 00:41:30,255
- Who says he's innocent?
- This is ridiculous.

685

- Just assisting.
- No!

686

- You'd just have to...
- No, no, no, no!

687

I'm not listening.
I can't hear you. I can't hear you.

- You're being childish.

Ooga-shacka, ooga-shacka...

690
00:41:40,263 --> 00:41:41,930
- Not listening.
- Ohildish.

691
00:41:42,015 --> 00:41:44,516
You're being childish.
All I'm asking you...

692
00:41:44,558 --> 00:41:47,101
- Ta, ta, ta, ta, ta!
- All right. All right.

I won't tell you.

694
00:41:49,271 --> 00:41:50,688
- Good.
- Won't mention it.

695
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:52,147
- Great.
- I won't say that

696
00:41:52,231 --> 00:41:54,190
all you have to do
is trip on the street.

697
00:41:54,233 --> 00:41:57,443
- I can't believe you just said that.
- Just trip in half an hour

698
00:41:57,527 --> 00:42:00,445
- so his bodyguards look the other way.
- No way.

699
00:42:02,573 --> 00:42:05,116
Fifty thousand dollars
is what I could pay you.

700
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,784
- No.
- A lot of money. Oash.

701
00:42:06,868 --> 00:42:09,912
- It could be interesting and fun.
- I said no.

702

He's a prick, a real prick!

703

who he is or what he did

705

I'm not gonna help you, Julian.
I'm not gonna do that.

I'll... I'll leave.

- Ohange it.
- You.

711
00:42:36,975 --> 00:42:38,434
- Fine.
- OK.

712
00:42:40,770 --> 00:42:44,522
When I was a kid,
I wanted to be a cheerleader.

713
00:42:47,066 --> 00:42:49,401
Really. A cheerleader.

714
00:42:49,443 --> 00:42:53,029
Yeah. I wanted to be thrown in the air
and march in the band.

715
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:56,824
Seriously?

716
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:58,616
Mm-hm.

717
00:42:59,201 --> 00:43:00,868
That's so funny.

718
00:43:00,952 --> 00:43:03,996
I've got a brother-in-law
who was a male cheerleader...

719
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,456
Jesus Ohrist, Danny!
I'm fucking kidding!

720
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:08,583
I don't want to
talk about cheerleaders

721
00:43:08,625 --> 00:43:11,210
unless I talk about getting in
a shower with them!

722
00:43:11,294 --> 00:43:14,629
I want to talk about what I wanted to,
which you don't want to!

723
00:43:14,713 --> 00:43:17,048
There's nothing
to talk about!

724
00:43:20,384 --> 00:43:22,594
Well, then,
it was nice knowing you.

725
00:43:22,636 --> 00:43:24,887
Oh, come...
Now, Julian...

726
00:43:24,971 --> 00:43:27,055
Oome on, what are you...
You're leaving?

727
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:29,141
I've got business to attend to.

728
00:43:29,225 --> 00:43:31,226
- I really thought...
- Nothing.

729
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:35,896
Think nothing. Just consider me the best
cocktail party story you ever met.

730
00:43:37,064 --> 00:43:38,982
Bye, Danny.

731
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:43,486
Julian!

732
00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:54,661
[Phil] So unfortunately,
I was right.

733
00:43:54,745 --> 00:43:56,913
I finally got in touch with Alejandra

734
00:43:56,997 --> 00:43:58,414
and she said her bosses are

735
00:43:58,498 --> 00:44:00,833
leaning towards Cardenas
and his group,

736
00:44:00,875 --> 00:44:02,334
and not us.

737
00:44:02,376 --> 00:44:05,044
Now, things still might
break in our favor.

738
00:44:05,128 --> 00:44:07,546
I mean, their first instinct
was to go with us,

739
00:44:07,630 --> 00:44:09,673
but they're getting intense pressure

740
00:44:09,715 --> 00:44:11,841
to sign with a Mexican company.

741
00:44:11,884 --> 00:44:13,927
I'm trying to get Antonio
so I can set up

742
00:44:14,010 --> 00:44:16,220
one more meeting
with you guys tomorrow.

743
00:44:16,304 --> 00:44:18,222
I'll call you
when I hear something.

744
00:44:18,305 --> 00:44:21,098

It's not over yet.

Oome on, Danny,

749
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,126
I just want to say I'm sorry.

750

I know it's late,
and I'm a little fucked up.

But... I'm sorry.

have asked you to help me.

I infringed on your kindness,

but please...

00:45:18,687 --> 00:45:21,439

Let me apologize.

how guilty I feel?

Goddamn it, you leave the game,
even for a while,

I don't know if they'll
let you back in.

And then what
are you gonna do?

810
00:48:34,425 --> 00:48:36,718
Waste days picking up
illiterate teenagers

811
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:40,012
for suck-and-fuck sessions
behind the Old Navy store?

812
00:48:40,055 --> 00:48:43,224
- Sounds delightful to me.
- Julian, do this job.

813
00:48:43,266 --> 00:48:46,226
If you don't, you're going to regret it,
I promise you.

814
00:48:46,310 --> 00:48:47,769
How do you know?

815
00:48:52,231 --> 00:48:55,942
Just do it, Julian.
Please, do it. OK?

We have a problem, Mr. Randy.

824
00:51:25,102 --> 00:51:27,562
The problem is Julian Noble.

825
00:51:27,688 --> 00:51:30,690
Seems he didn't
deliver the portfolio.

826

You know...

827
00:51:33,943 --> 00:51:37,404
...it says it took 53 years

828
00:51:37,529 --> 00:51:39,363
to paint this ceiling.

Mr. Stick knows.

Well, he knows we can fix it.

No.

Yes, you'll replace him,

but no.

843

Mr. Stick has asked

Seems like yesterday, right?

862
00:53:44,963 --> 00:53:47,089
Henry was alive...

863
00:53:48,883 --> 00:53:50,008
...here.

864
00:53:55,638 --> 00:53:59,140
When I was first in high school,
I told you they made fun of me.

865
00:53:59,266 --> 00:54:02,310
And they called me Hippo Hips

866
00:54:02,394 --> 00:54:05,604
and Plate of Beans, the works.

867
00:54:07,773 --> 00:54:10,274
And even though I did basketball

868
00:54:10,358 --> 00:54:12,609
and... and chorus and...

869
00:54:12,652 --> 00:54:16,530
And I had a few friends
and I acted strong...

...I never was.

871
00:54:20,908 --> 00:54:24,327
Because I believed them always,
every last cruel word.

872
00:54:26,329 --> 00:54:27,830
And I...

873
00:54:27,872 --> 00:54:30,832
I always thought
I would believe them.

874
00:54:31,917 --> 00:54:34,127
Until I met you.

875
00:54:37,672 --> 00:54:40,340
You arrived in 12th grade...

876
00:54:42,342 --> 00:54:45,719
...and you told me
that I was pretty.

877
00:54:45,803 --> 00:54:48,680
And for the first time,
I believed it.

878

You told me that I was sexy.

[crying]... you told me
to stay strong...

...and that we would
get through it.

And we did.

We did.

885
00:55:21,331 --> 00:55:23,374
It's because you
never gave up on me.

Yes. All right.

Of course.
I could get coffee.

00:58:23,893 --> 00:58:25,811
I could ask him to leave.

945
00:58:25,853 --> 00:58:27,896
We just asked him to stay.

946
00:58:28,021 --> 00:58:30,022
We could change our minds.

947
00:58:30,106 --> 00:58:32,858
Why? Do you think he's dangerous?

948
00:58:33,942 --> 00:58:36,986
He's an assassin, Bean.
Of course he's dangerous.

But I mean "dangerous" dangerous.

You said he was a nice guy.

He is. For an assassin,
he's... very nice.

00:58:52,540 --> 00:58:55,333
Especially now.
If not now, when?

00:58:55,376 --> 00:58:57,127
True.

957

This is the fucking perfect time

958
00:58:59,046 --> 00:59:00,755
to be fucking cursing.

standing in our
fucking living room.

961
00:59:08,553 --> 00:59:11,471
Do you think he
would show me his gun?

962
00:59:17,936 --> 00:59:19,937
[Bean] A toast, maybe?

963
00:59:20,062 --> 00:59:21,729

Well, you're not a stranger.

Well, I'm pretty strange.

967

Be that as it may,
you're not a stranger, Julian.

968
00:59:30,821 --> 00:59:32,280
Far from it.

969
00:59:32,364 --> 00:59:35,533
The toast really
should be to you, Danny.

970
00:59:35,575 --> 00:59:37,076
And to you, Bean.

00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,919
Hmm! [chuckling]

974
00:59:50,962 --> 00:59:53,422
I never thought
I'd see you again, Julian.

975
00:59:53,464 --> 00:59:55,632
I never thought
I'd see you again, Danny.

976
00:59:55,715 --> 00:59:56,924
But, well...

977
00:59:56,966 --> 00:59:58,425
...things, uh...

978
00:59:58,676 --> 01:00:02,428
Things change.
They just change.

979
01:00:02,471 --> 01:00:04,347
[Julian] Is that...?

980
01:00:06,557 --> 01:00:09,642
- You saved it.
- I did.

981
01:00:09,768 --> 01:00:11,727
You saved it.
I can't believe it.

982
01:00:11,812 --> 01:00:15,273
- [Bean] He still talks about that.
- No, it's...

983
01:00:15,314 --> 01:00:17,357
It touches me
that you kept it.

984
01:00:17,441 --> 01:00:18,775
How could I not?

985
01:00:18,817 --> 01:00:21,402
- That was a special day.
- Yes.

986
01:00:21,486 --> 01:00:24,154
So Danny told you what I did?

987
01:00:24,238 --> 01:00:26,406
Professionally?

988
01:00:27,699 --> 01:00:30,868
Did you bring your gun?

989
01:00:30,952 --> 01:00:34,246
Yes... as a matter of fact.

990
01:00:34,288 --> 01:00:36,247
May I see it?

991
01:00:36,289 --> 01:00:37,873
Really?

992
01:00:37,957 --> 01:00:40,167
- Yes, please.
- Honey, he's notjust...

993
01:00:40,251 --> 01:00:41,585
- Here you go.
- OK.

994
01:00:49,633 --> 01:00:51,467
Is that a.38?

995
01:00:51,677 --> 01:00:53,219
Yes, it is.

996
01:00:53,303 --> 01:00:55,763
You know your guns, Bean.

997
01:00:55,805 --> 01:00:58,181
Yes, well...

998
01:00:58,265 --> 01:00:59,932
My God.

999
01:00:59,975 --> 01:01:02,893
You are a magnificent woman.

1000
01:01:02,977 --> 01:01:04,311
Hm.

1001
01:01:04,395 --> 01:01:07,647
Bean knows a lot of things
about a lot of things.

1002
01:01:07,731 --> 01:01:09,398
Bean, tell me,

1003
01:01:09,482 --> 01:01:11,441
did Danny tell you everything

1004
01:01:11,484 --> 01:01:13,735
about our time
in Mexico together?

1005
01:01:13,819 --> 01:01:15,820
Yes, I'm sure. Why?

1006
01:01:17,113 --> 01:01:18,489
Oh.

1007
01:01:21,242 --> 01:01:24,077
My God, you look great, Danny.

1008
01:01:24,161 --> 01:01:25,828
[Laughing] Really great.

1009
01:01:25,870 --> 01:01:28,330
- You do too, Julian.
- Oh, no.

1010
01:01:28,414 --> 01:01:31,166
I look like a Bangkok hooker
on a Sunday morning

1011
01:01:31,250 --> 01:01:33,251
after the Navy left town.

1012
01:01:33,335 --> 01:01:34,460
But you...

1013
01:01:34,711 --> 01:01:36,921
Life's been good to you,
am I right?

1014
01:01:37,004 --> 01:01:38,505
Pretty good, yeah.

1015
01:01:38,630 --> 01:01:42,049
Your work? You have that respect
you wanted back again?

1016
01:01:42,175 --> 01:01:43,801
I do.

1017
01:01:43,843 --> 01:01:46,136
So you got thatjob
you were in Mexico for?

1018
01:01:46,178 --> 01:01:47,470
We did.

1019
01:01:47,512 --> 01:01:49,513
And your luck?
It's better, right?

1020
01:01:49,556 --> 01:01:51,599
No more trees in the kitchen?

1021
01:01:52,850 --> 01:01:55,310
You told him about that?

1022
01:01:55,352 --> 01:01:57,687
And you love Bean
more than ever.

1023
01:01:57,729 --> 01:02:00,230
Mm. That I do.

1024
01:02:00,356 --> 01:02:03,149
Then what more could you want?

1025
01:02:03,192 --> 01:02:04,442
Here's a toast.

1026
01:02:04,693 --> 01:02:08,070
To a man with respect again,

1027
01:02:08,154 --> 01:02:11,781
to a woman who's more lovely
than any man deserves

1028
01:02:11,865 --> 01:02:13,658
and to me.

1029
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:16,827
What is the toast to you for?

1030
01:02:16,911 --> 01:02:19,204
Toast to a dead man, Bean.

1031
01:02:20,288 --> 01:02:22,706
Toast to a dead man.

1032
01:02:25,042 --> 01:02:28,461
[Julian] Then about two months ago
I had this job in Manila.

1033
01:02:28,545 --> 01:02:31,046
Now, normally,
this would make me happy.

1034
01:02:31,130 --> 01:02:32,547
I like the hot climate.

1035
01:02:32,590 --> 01:02:35,217
The guys look like chicks.
It's fucking fantastic.

1036
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:38,469
The thing was,
I was burnt-out.

1037
01:02:38,553 --> 01:02:42,014
I didn't know it, didn't even know
what "burnt-out" meant at the time.

1038
01:02:42,097 --> 01:02:46,058
But I was.
I was a classic textbook case.

1039
01:02:53,023 --> 01:02:54,941
[Julian] I was having panic attacks.

1040
01:02:55,024 --> 01:02:57,234
I was completely
losing control of myself.

1041
01:02:57,276 --> 01:02:59,694
I tried to counter this
with booze, of course,

1042
01:02:59,736 --> 01:03:01,654
but nothing was working.

1043
01:03:01,738 --> 01:03:04,907
I drank and drank and...

1044
01:03:04,949 --> 01:03:06,450
...nothing.

1045
01:03:06,575 --> 01:03:08,034
I was still feeling edgy,

1046
01:03:08,118 --> 01:03:11,078
still feeling like
my head was going to explode.

1047
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:12,704
So...

1048
01:03:12,788 --> 01:03:15,706
...I moved on
to my other usual diversions.

1049
01:03:15,749 --> 01:03:17,750
A wonderful little
whorehouse I knew

1050
01:03:17,834 --> 01:03:21,086
right off of Mabini Street.

1051
01:03:21,170 --> 01:03:23,880
But that wasn't workin'either.

1052
01:03:23,922 --> 01:03:26,006
And a good fuck usually does.

1053
01:03:26,091 --> 01:03:27,592
Excuse my French.

1054
01:03:28,426 --> 01:03:30,385
- Go on.
- So I had this assignment.

1055
01:03:30,427 --> 01:03:33,137
Nothing special,
some copper wire executive,

1056
01:03:33,221 --> 01:03:34,930
someone doesn't
want him around.

1057
01:03:35,014 --> 01:03:37,349
You know,
my usual type gig.

1058
01:03:37,433 --> 01:03:39,434
Well, I knew that this copper wire guy

1059
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:43,271
always came to this sweaty little
outdoor market every Thursday

1060
01:03:43,354 --> 01:03:44,646
to buy fruit.

1061
01:03:45,648 --> 01:03:47,816
The guy liked his fruit.

1062
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:51,903
[Monkeys chattering]

1063
01:03:55,572 --> 01:03:57,281
It was a simple plan.

1064
01:03:57,324 --> 01:04:00,326
As he walks through the crowds
I bump into him

1065
01:04:00,451 --> 01:04:02,619
and stab him.

1066
01:04:12,502 --> 01:04:15,212
The thing was,
I was still a mess.

1067
01:04:17,798 --> 01:04:20,591
And every time I looked at the guy,
I didn't see him,

1068
01:04:20,634 --> 01:04:23,636
but I saw a little boy insteadl

1069
01:04:31,809 --> 01:04:34,185
And it wasn't just any boy.

1070
01:04:35,354 --> 01:04:36,771
It was me.

1071
01:04:36,813 --> 01:04:38,897
Me, as a child!

1072
01:04:42,068 --> 01:04:43,986
It was freaky shit, right?

1073
01:04:46,071 --> 01:04:49,823
Real nervous breakdown sort of stuff.

1074
01:04:55,662 --> 01:04:59,081
Still readied the knife,
still prepared for thejob.

1075
01:04:59,164 --> 01:05:00,623
But...

1076
01:05:04,419 --> 01:05:06,670
...I couldn't do it.

1077
01:05:06,754 --> 01:05:09,214
I just couldn't do it.

1078
01:05:20,598 --> 01:05:21,807
Then what happened?

1079
01:05:21,849 --> 01:05:24,517
I woke up in a pile
of donkey shit.

1080
01:05:25,269 --> 01:05:26,519
I fainted.

1081
01:05:27,312 --> 01:05:30,314
And I guess I landed
in a pile of donkey shit.

1082
01:05:30,398 --> 01:05:32,774
[Donkeys braying]

1083
01:05:34,859 --> 01:05:36,318
And since then,

1084
01:05:36,361 --> 01:05:38,821
it's been extremely
hot and cold.

1085
01:05:38,863 --> 01:05:43,199
Some jobs go OK,
others not so OK.

1086
01:05:45,284 --> 01:05:48,328
And then a few weeks ago
I fucked up again. In Budapest.

1087
01:05:48,579 --> 01:05:50,330
Froze.

1088
01:05:50,372 --> 01:05:53,082
Right at the moment
I should have been firing.

1089
01:05:53,166 --> 01:05:55,876
[Sighs] Oouldn't finish the job.

1090
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:57,711
And that was that.

1091
01:05:58,503 --> 01:06:00,379
And now it's just a matter of time.

1092
01:06:01,714 --> 01:06:05,049
Well, isn't there somebody
that you can talk to?

1093
01:06:05,133 --> 01:06:07,718
Like Mary Beth
in Human Resources?

1094
01:06:07,802 --> 01:06:10,220
Oome on, this is...
this is insane.

1095
01:06:10,263 --> 01:06:12,473
They're gonna kill you
for botching a job?

1096
01:06:12,556 --> 01:06:13,723
Mm-hm.

1097
01:06:13,807 --> 01:06:16,517
Well, can't you just,
you know, say to them,

1098
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:19,144
you know, "You know what? I'm sorry.

1099
01:06:19,228 --> 01:06:21,062
You know,
I was a little burned out,

1100
01:06:21,146 --> 01:06:22,688
and I'm a little messed up."

1101
01:06:22,772 --> 01:06:26,149
I mean, can't you do that?
But...

1102
01:06:26,234 --> 01:06:30,153
I mean, you were seeing images
of yourself as a small boy.

1103
01:06:30,237 --> 01:06:33,155
If that's not a Freudian meltdown,
I don't know what is.

1104
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:35,198
But certainly,
they have to see that.

1105
01:06:35,241 --> 01:06:37,534
No, they don't.
They don't.

1106
01:06:37,576 --> 01:06:39,118
I mean, I...

1107
01:06:39,244 --> 01:06:41,620
I'd be dead if my handler
hadn't risked his life

1108
01:06:41,704 --> 01:06:43,413
and tipped me off to the plans.

1109
01:06:43,497 --> 01:06:46,541
I barely got out of Budapest alive.

1110
01:06:46,625 --> 01:06:48,668
And how did you end up here?

1111
01:06:48,751 --> 01:06:50,418
In Denver?

1112
01:06:50,503 --> 01:06:51,753
Hm.

1113
01:06:53,755 --> 01:06:55,297
That's funny.

1114

the problem I shared
with Danny in Mexico,

1117

is that I don't have a home.

[Julian] God, she's really
fantastic, Danny.

1134
01:07:57,222 --> 01:07:59,473
She's lovely.

1135
01:07:59,516 --> 01:08:01,600
[Danny] She's everything to me.

1136
01:08:01,684 --> 01:08:04,394
You said that to me in Mexico.

1137
01:08:04,478 --> 01:08:07,188
And I nodded and listened...

1138
01:08:07,689 --> 01:08:09,982
...but now I see.

1139
01:08:11,150 --> 01:08:12,609
I see.

1140
01:08:14,069 --> 01:08:15,945
You were right.

1141
01:08:20,324 --> 01:08:23,326
You told her everything
that happened in Mexico?

1142
01:08:25,495 --> 01:08:28,539
I told her about
our time together, yes.

1143
01:08:31,166 --> 01:08:33,834
And where does that story end?

1144
01:08:37,004 --> 01:08:39,005
She knows the last I heard of you

1145
01:08:39,089 --> 01:08:41,841
you were knocking on my room
in the middle of the night

1146
01:08:41,883 --> 01:08:44,968
asking forgiveness for trying
to involve me in a job.

1147
01:08:46,970 --> 01:08:49,346
That's what you said?

1148
01:08:49,556 --> 01:08:52,141
That I knocked and knocked.

1149
01:08:52,224 --> 01:08:54,350
And you never answered?

1150
01:08:56,227 --> 01:08:57,644
Yes.

1151
01:08:59,438 --> 01:09:00,397
[Bean] Gentlemen.

1152
01:09:03,025 --> 01:09:05,485
- I'm a bit drunk.
- [Julian chuckles]

1153
01:09:05,568 --> 01:09:07,861
That's a nice place to be.

1154
01:09:07,903 --> 01:09:10,863
Julian, you will stay
the night, of course?

1155
01:09:10,947 --> 01:09:12,990
Oh, thank you, Bean.

1156
01:09:13,074 --> 01:09:15,325
I promise I'll be
out of here tomorrow.

1157
01:09:15,368 --> 01:09:17,327
Oh, let's not talk about that now.

1158
01:09:17,536 --> 01:09:19,996
You know, I don't think
I've been up with a guest

1159
01:09:20,038 --> 01:09:23,040
till 2:30 in the morning
in a long time.

1160
01:09:23,124 --> 01:09:24,166
It's good, right?

1161
01:09:24,250 --> 01:09:26,710
- Oh, it's very good.
- Hey...

1162
01:09:26,793 --> 01:09:28,711
Oan I turn on your stereo?

1163
01:09:28,753 --> 01:09:31,671
- Sure. Now?
- Yeah, I saw this old record of yours,

1164
01:09:31,714 --> 01:09:35,883
and I just wanted to hear In the Wee
Small Hours of the Morning. You know?

1165
01:09:35,926 --> 01:09:38,594
Since we're in the wee small hours
of the morning?

1166
01:09:38,678 --> 01:09:40,095
Is that OK?

1167
01:09:40,179 --> 01:09:41,680
Oertainly. I guess.

I hope you approve, but...

1171
01:10:01,654 --> 01:10:04,531
...I would really like
to ask your wife to dance.

1172
01:10:07,909 --> 01:10:10,786
Julian, you have had
too much to drink.

1173

Bean.

1174
01:10:14,456 --> 01:10:16,499
Please, may I have this dance?

I learned to dance in a South American

01:11:26,805 --> 01:11:29,056
Well, that's another story,

I can't think about the headache
I'm gonna have.

[Both laughing]

1199

The only woman I ever loved.

1200
01:11:49,073 --> 01:11:51,199
My mother.

1201
01:11:51,325 --> 01:11:54,285
- What about your wife?
- Hm?

1202
01:11:54,369 --> 01:11:57,579
- My wife?
- Danny told me that you were married

1203
01:11:57,663 --> 01:12:00,623
and that she died in a car accident.
You loved her.

01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:02,875
Um...

1205

Oh, my God!

I can't believe this!

1207

I was never married.

1208
01:12:19,180 --> 01:12:21,598
- I can't believe this!
- No car accident?

1209
01:12:21,682 --> 01:12:25,143
No. I'd been insensitive
to Danny about your son

1210
01:12:25,227 --> 01:12:27,603
and was trying to win him over.
It was stupid.

1211
01:12:27,687 --> 01:12:29,980
You know what,
I'm the one that was stupid.

1212

No, no, no, no, no!

1213

You're not stupid.
I'm a prick! Me, not you!

1214

The thing is, I could have
kept lying to you now,

1215
01:12:37,194 --> 01:12:39,404
but I chose not to,
as a sign of respect.

1216

Because... well, now we're friends.

Oh.

We are friends, aren't we?

1219
01:12:46,410 --> 01:12:48,995
So, what other bullshit
did you pour over me?

01:12:49,079 --> 01:12:51,163
Yeah, are you even
a hit man, Julian?

Yeah, a facility fatalitator,

just roll over us
like the summer breeze.

Next we shall be
wife swapping. Ha!

Oome on.
I've gotta talk to you.

What is it, Julian?
What do you want?

We can't talk about it here.

[Danny] OK, Julian,
we're in your rent-a-car.

- What is it?
- The thing is, Danny...

...the thing I didn't tell you,

1254
01:14:55,721 --> 01:14:59,223
the thing that I omitted
because Bean was present,

1255
01:14:59,307 --> 01:15:02,809
was that I've been offered a way
out of my fatal predicament.

1256
01:15:04,770 --> 01:15:06,980
- Well, that's good.
- I know, I know.

1257
01:15:07,063 --> 01:15:09,314
No, that's really good.
What is it?

1258
01:15:09,398 --> 01:15:13,150
My handler, Mr. Randy,
contacted me like he always does

1259
01:15:13,193 --> 01:15:16,987
with an ad in the International Tribune
looking for cat-sitters in Bali.

1260
01:15:17,029 --> 01:15:20,239
Is that how you stay in contact?
Oat-sitter ads?

1261
01:15:20,324 --> 01:15:22,075
Yeah.

1262
01:15:22,159 --> 01:15:23,952
OK, you know,
this is ridiculous.

1263
01:15:23,993 --> 01:15:26,244
- I'm so tired, Julian.
- Well, anyway,

1264
01:15:26,329 --> 01:15:28,247
he contacted me four days ago

1265
01:15:28,330 --> 01:15:30,790
and basically said
he'd been to the higher-ups

1266
01:15:30,874 --> 01:15:32,833
and got me a reprieve.

1267
01:15:32,875 --> 01:15:36,044
Well, like I said, that's...
that's... great news.

1268
01:15:36,128 --> 01:15:38,338
The thing is...

1269
01:15:38,421 --> 01:15:40,797
...he's asked me
to do one more job.

1270
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:42,966
I have no choice.
It's do the job or else.

1271
01:15:43,050 --> 01:15:44,259
Right.

1272
01:15:44,343 --> 01:15:47,762
And that brings us
to the dirty little problem.

1273
01:15:49,514 --> 01:15:51,015
All right.

1274
01:15:52,307 --> 01:15:53,516
What's the problem?

1275
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:57,186
It's a pretty big problem,
and you're really not gonna like it.

1276
01:15:57,270 --> 01:15:59,646
- I'm not gonna like it?
- Not at all.

1277
01:15:59,688 --> 01:16:02,189
Because the job...

1278
01:16:04,025 --> 01:16:05,317
...involves you.

1279
01:16:09,279 --> 01:16:11,614
You're not saying
what I think you're saying.

1280
01:16:11,698 --> 01:16:13,949
What do you think I'm saying?

1281
01:16:14,033 --> 01:16:16,951
You know what
I think you're saying.

1282
01:16:17,035 --> 01:16:20,871
No. I don't think I know
what you think I'm saying.

1283
01:16:22,707 --> 01:16:25,625
Does somebody want me dead?

01:16:35,050 --> 01:16:37,260
- No.
- What's that?

1285
01:16:37,343 --> 01:16:38,927
No one wants you dead, Danny.

1286
01:16:39,053 --> 01:16:43,598
- Jesus!
- [Whimpering] You scared me!

1287
01:16:43,723 --> 01:16:45,766
No. No...

1288
01:16:45,892 --> 01:16:48,060
You were doing that...

1289
01:16:48,143 --> 01:16:50,895
But I need your help
in facilitating a fatality.

1290

- What?
- I need your help.

1291
01:16:52,397 --> 01:16:55,315
No, no, no.
My help is exactly what you don't need.

1292
01:16:55,399 --> 01:16:57,192
I'm a mess, Danny, you know that.

1293
01:16:57,234 --> 01:16:58,484
I'm a complete mess.

1294
01:16:58,568 --> 01:17:00,652
I don't know
if I can do this job by myself.

1295
01:17:00,737 --> 01:17:03,072
You gotta talk
to somebody else, a colleague.

1296
01:17:03,114 --> 01:17:05,032
- I don't know colleagues.
- You must!

1297
01:17:05,073 --> 01:17:07,366
- I don't.
- Well, I can't help you.

1298
01:17:07,409 --> 01:17:09,744
I know you're not
the ideal candidate...

1299
01:17:09,786 --> 01:17:13,372
No. I'm far, far from ideal, Julian.

1300
01:17:13,455 --> 01:17:17,207
Remember my reaction the last time
you proposed something this asinine?

1301
01:17:17,250 --> 01:17:20,085
That was Mexico.
I was trying to show you a good time!

1302
01:17:20,169 --> 01:17:22,587
Oh, so now killing somebody
is a good time?

1303
01:17:22,671 --> 01:17:24,130
Oan be.

1304
01:17:24,255 --> 01:17:26,673
- Oh... I'm going to sleep.
- Danny, come on.

1305
01:17:26,757 --> 01:17:28,967
You don't even need
a second person.

1306
01:17:29,051 --> 01:17:31,094
Haven't you done these things yourself?

1307
01:17:31,219 --> 01:17:33,178
Some jobs are better
with two men.

1308
01:17:33,263 --> 01:17:36,682
I think it's better
if the second man isn't scared shitless,

1309
01:17:36,765 --> 01:17:38,141
and... and unprepared.

1310
01:17:38,225 --> 01:17:40,726
And unqualified and uninterested!

1311
01:17:40,810 --> 01:17:42,186
Now I'm gonna go to bed.

1312
01:17:42,270 --> 01:17:44,563
I'm in a very dangerous position here.

1313
01:17:44,605 --> 01:17:46,606
I'm in no shape to try this myself.

1314
01:17:46,732 --> 01:17:49,692
An assassin without confidence
is a horrible thing.

1315
01:17:49,776 --> 01:17:52,736
It's like a relief pitcher
who fumbles the ball.

1316
01:17:53,987 --> 01:17:56,739
Tell me you know you mixed
two sports in your metaphor.

1317
01:17:56,781 --> 01:17:58,782
Huh? I can't do that.

1318
01:17:58,866 --> 01:18:00,325
Yeah.

1319
01:18:01,869 --> 01:18:03,495
Danny! Danny, please!

1320
01:18:03,620 --> 01:18:05,079
I need your help!

1321
01:18:05,163 --> 01:18:07,289
Someone's gonna die,
a stranger or me.

1322
01:18:07,373 --> 01:18:09,958
Which would you rather? Hm?

1323
01:18:10,083 --> 01:18:12,042
Look,

1324
01:18:12,127 --> 01:18:14,795
if I can do the job successfully,
I'm free and clear.

1325
01:18:14,879 --> 01:18:16,296
Free and clear, Danny!

1326
01:18:16,338 --> 01:18:19,256
I have enough money to retire
to a beautiful Greek island

1327
01:18:19,299 --> 01:18:20,591
with beautiful Greeks.

1328
01:18:20,633 --> 01:18:23,218
Heaven awaits me, Danny,
if you and I do this job.

1329
01:18:23,302 --> 01:18:25,637
- I can't.
- Oh, damn it, Danny!

And...

1333
01:18:30,975 --> 01:18:33,226
- Oh...
- And what?

1334
01:18:33,310 --> 01:18:35,770

You owe me.

1337
01:18:43,151 --> 01:18:46,153
If this were to happen,
when would it take place?

1338
01:18:46,237 --> 01:18:48,655
Today. The horse races.

1339
01:18:50,157 --> 01:18:52,116
- Today?
- Yeah, Arizona.

1340
01:18:52,158 --> 01:18:53,659
No, that couldn't happen.

1341
01:18:53,743 --> 01:18:55,202
Sorry, no choice.

1342
01:18:56,370 --> 01:18:59,622
Today is the four-year anniversary
of my son Henry's death.

1343
01:18:59,664 --> 01:19:01,999
We go to the cemetery.
That's what we do.

1344
01:19:02,083 --> 01:19:04,835
What time does
the cemetery close, Danny?

1345
01:19:04,877 --> 01:19:06,628
Well, I-I don't know.

1346
01:19:06,670 --> 01:19:09,672
We'll have you back at 4:30,
flowers in hand. I promise.

1347
01:19:09,756 --> 01:19:11,966
Oh. Oh.
You'll do that? OK.

1348
01:19:12,007 --> 01:19:13,591
How will you do that, Julian?

1349
01:19:13,675 --> 01:19:17,177
Well, we have a 7:40 plane reservation
to Tucson this morning.

1350
01:19:17,303 --> 01:19:19,179
Plenty of time
to catch the 2:30 back.

1351
01:19:19,430 --> 01:19:20,972
- We do?
- Mm-hm.

1352
01:19:21,056 --> 01:19:24,266
I made it yesterday.
First class. Real fancy.

1353
01:19:24,351 --> 01:19:25,810
Now, chop-chop.

1354
01:19:25,852 --> 01:19:28,896
Upstairs. Get dressed.
Make a story up to Bean.

1355
01:19:29,021 --> 01:19:31,856
We've gotta get
this road on the show. Eh?

01:27:15,975 --> 01:27:18,268
Yay!

1447
01:27:34,740 --> 01:27:36,032
Thank you.

1448
01:27:37,742 --> 01:27:40,369
No, really, I mean it.

1449
01:27:40,452 --> 01:27:42,536
I was a mess back there.

1450
01:27:43,580 --> 01:27:45,081
You helped me.

1451
01:27:45,206 --> 01:27:47,165
You helped me a lot.

1452
01:27:51,503 --> 01:27:53,963
I think I can handle
the deviant Julian.

1453
01:27:54,047 --> 01:27:56,090
I can handle the lying Julian.

1454
01:27:56,215 --> 01:27:58,716
I can even handle
the killing Julian.

1455
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:02,386
I just don't know if I can
handle the humble pie Julian.

1456
01:28:02,470 --> 01:28:04,763
[Laughing]

1457
01:28:04,805 --> 01:28:07,598
Well, enjoy it.
It won't last.

1458
01:28:07,682 --> 01:28:09,558
That's a given.

1459
01:28:11,560 --> 01:28:13,519
[Bell dings over PA]

1460
01:28:13,604 --> 01:28:15,438
Really, it's...

1461
01:28:15,522 --> 01:28:17,565
...no problem.

1462
01:28:18,941 --> 01:28:21,609
You said it yourself.

1463
01:28:21,735 --> 01:28:22,902
I owed you.

1464
01:28:25,155 --> 01:28:28,616
Do you think if you hadn't opened
the door that night in Mexico Oity

1465
01:28:28,657 --> 01:28:31,659
the two of us would be
sitting on this plane now?

1466
01:28:34,620 --> 01:28:36,704
Probably not.

1467
01:28:39,291 --> 01:28:40,375
[Knocking]

1468
01:28:40,458 --> 01:28:42,876
[Julian] Oome on,
I want to say I'm sorry.

1469
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:45,795
I know it's late,
and I'm a little fucked up.

1470
01:28:45,879 --> 01:28:47,797
But I'm sorry.

1471
01:28:47,839 --> 01:28:50,674
Oan't you see how guilty I feel?

1472
01:28:51,967 --> 01:28:53,634
Danny!

1473
01:28:53,719 --> 01:28:55,678
- Danny!
- Hold on, Julian.

1474
01:28:55,762 --> 01:28:56,929
I'm coming.

1475
01:29:01,934 --> 01:29:05,144
I don't know what I'll do
if I don't get this job.

1476
01:29:05,186 --> 01:29:07,187
[Sighs]

1477
01:29:07,313 --> 01:29:11,357
And you're sure if I kill off this
Oardenas guy you'll get the contract?

1478
01:29:11,483 --> 01:29:13,818
He's our only competition.

1479
01:29:13,860 --> 01:29:16,320
And you can live with that?

1480
01:29:16,403 --> 01:29:17,987
Yeah.

1481
01:29:18,113 --> 01:29:21,073
You can live with
that blood on your hands, hm?

1482
01:29:22,408 --> 01:29:24,492
Isn't that what people do?

1483
01:29:24,577 --> 01:29:27,037
Don't people...

1484
01:29:28,079 --> 01:29:30,038
...successful people...

1485
01:29:30,164 --> 01:29:32,415
...always live with
blood on their hands?

1486
01:29:36,711 --> 01:29:39,504
[Danny] You became my friend
that night, Julian.

1487
01:29:39,589 --> 01:29:42,090
You became my lifelong friend.

1488
01:30:01,773 --> 01:30:04,858
I'm not gonna do it for you.

1489
01:30:04,984 --> 01:30:07,402
You're making a late night...

1490
01:30:07,486 --> 01:30:09,696
...exhausted, desperate decision,

1491
01:30:09,779 --> 01:30:13,281
and if I did it,
you would regret it instantly

1492
01:30:13,365 --> 01:30:15,533
and feel nothing
but guilt and shame

1493
01:30:15,659 --> 01:30:18,577
for the rest of your life,
believe me.

1494
01:30:19,662 --> 01:30:21,621
I'm so scared, Julian.

1495
01:30:23,206 --> 01:30:25,249
Guys like you...

1496
01:30:25,375 --> 01:30:27,501
...you think you have no luck.

1497
01:30:27,585 --> 01:30:30,712
But you have
all the luck in the world.

1498
01:30:31,463 --> 01:30:33,881
You just need to see it.

1499
01:30:33,923 --> 01:30:37,342
She's at home waiting for you.

1500
01:30:38,594 --> 01:30:40,387
If I did thatjob for you,

1501
01:30:40,470 --> 01:30:43,722
your luck would run bad
for the rest of your days.

1502
01:30:46,809 --> 01:30:49,561
You don't want me to do it, anyway.
I know you don't.

1503
01:30:49,644 --> 01:30:52,020
You're not that type of person.

1504
01:30:53,897 --> 01:30:54,981
Hm.

1505
01:30:57,567 --> 01:30:59,902
That's why I like you.

1506
01:30:59,944 --> 01:31:03,029
[Laughing]
You're the exact opposite of me.

1507
01:31:05,323 --> 01:31:07,157
Huh?

1508
01:31:07,241 --> 01:31:09,742
[Danny] You surprised me that night.

1509
01:31:09,827 --> 01:31:12,579
I surprised myself.

1510
01:31:14,956 --> 01:31:16,832
Well...

1511
01:31:16,916 --> 01:31:19,751
...I guess your boss
must be satisfied, right?

1512
01:31:19,793 --> 01:31:22,086
You completed the assignment,

1513
01:31:22,337 --> 01:31:24,588
no longer on the hit list.

1514
01:31:26,090 --> 01:31:28,383
Well, I'm no longer
on the hit list,

1515
01:31:28,425 --> 01:31:30,509
but I didn't do any assignment.

1516
01:31:32,261 --> 01:31:34,262
I don't understand.

1517
01:31:34,305 --> 01:31:37,265
I thought your boss
wanted you to do this job.

1518
01:31:40,851 --> 01:31:42,602
My boss...

1519
01:31:42,686 --> 01:31:44,937
...Mr. Stick...

1520
01:31:44,980 --> 01:31:46,981
...he was the job.

1521
01:31:49,483 --> 01:31:50,859
You mean we just killed...

1522
01:31:50,943 --> 01:31:53,653
We killed the man
who wanted to kill me.

1523
01:31:54,737 --> 01:31:56,446
Problem solved.

1524
01:32:01,326 --> 01:32:02,910
You...

1525
01:32:02,994 --> 01:32:04,953
[chuckling]

1526
01:32:04,996 --> 01:32:07,581
You son of a bitch.

1527
01:32:07,664 --> 01:32:09,957
Among many other things.

1528
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,627
- Don't ever hit me again.
- Sorry.

1529
01:32:13,627 --> 01:32:23,627
