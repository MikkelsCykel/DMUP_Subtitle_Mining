00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,036
No questions about the layout, right?
No questions.

2
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,191
Let's go over this shit again.

3
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,034
They got a small dinger on the door.
l'll get 'em to open it.

4
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:57,035
Then me and Levine go in. Giolito
and Pederson, block this door.

5
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,749
OK? Rondell and Leppert,
hit the back door.

6
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,479
No problem. lt's a piece of cake.

7
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:08,236
McKee and Cline, you're outside
in case we get some jump-outs...

8
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,754
- Foley.
- Excuse me a sec.

9
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,795
Where in the hell is SWAT?

10
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,792
- Boss, l cancelled the SWAT team.
- You what?

11
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,475
l wouldn't raid
a church bingo game without SWAT.

12
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,950
These guys are carjackers.
They're mechanics.

13
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,032
We don't need SWAT
blowing holes in my evidence.

14
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,590
Besides, they might shoot somebody.
Let's do this.

15
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,873
This is your operation. l'm just
an observer, but l'll be watching.

16
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:42,078
Just observe how l don't have
to use SWAT, and trust me.

17
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,308
Everybody's ready?
Nobody need to take a nervous piss?

18
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,356
Let's mount up.

19
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:00,437
This is Dick Burton.
We've got 55 degrees this morning.

20
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:04,149
Here's Diana Ross and the Supremes,
Come See About Me.

21
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,392
What are you doing?

22
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,472
Bobby, they're here.

23
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,152
Any trouble with the hijack?

24
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,913
- Right where you said.
- Piece of cake.

25
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,275
- Anybody hurt?
- No.

26
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,194
Good. l don't like to see
people unnecessarily injured.

27
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,794
Nobody got hurt, boss.

28
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,156
- Keys?
- Ain't yours till we see money.

29
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,196
l just want to look in the back.

30
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,431
- Where's our money?
- Pay him.

31
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,355
You think we should have used SWAT?

32
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,115
- Fuck SWAT.
- That's what l say. Fuck SWAT.

33
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,990
- Some guy. What should l do?
- Kill him.

34
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:50,158
How you doing? ls this the illegal
chop shop where they chop up cars?

35
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,678
l got my wife's Buick. l want it
chopped, the bitch ain't been right.

36
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,234
Go, go, go!

37
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,111
Go!

38
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,196
They got fucking machineguns.

39
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:33,196
- You said they had no guns!
- They must have changed their view.

40
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,789
Get the 12-gauge.

41
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,996
We should've called SWAT.

42
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,510
Police! Hands in the air!

43
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,391
Move it! Go! Go!

44
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,472
What the...?

45
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,191
Daniel, come on!

46
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,670
Cover me. l'm going in with Todd.

47
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,953
Axel, you on a coffee break?

48
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,315
Go get that son of a bitch.

49
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,872
Boss. Hey, man! Shit!

50
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,557
We got a tail.

51
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,875
Wax that clown.

52
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,232
God damn it!

53
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,512
Help me, man.

54
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,838
Police officer!
Trying to catch a killer. Move it!

55
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,230
- Get out of my way! l'm a cop!
- Take it easy.

56
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,118
Get the fuck out of here,
all right?

57
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,358
Thank you. My name's Steve Fulbright.
Could l see some lD, please?

58
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:03,036
l am a Detroit police officer.
My name is Axel... Where's my shit?

59
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,557
l'm a police officer chasing
a killer who's getting away now.

60
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,870
- We know.
- You know what?

61
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,428
We know.

62
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:17,310
What's happened is you're in the
middle of a federal investigation.

63
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:22,030
What, income tax? The fucking guy
just shot a police officer!

64
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:25,351
lt's very important
he not be apprehended at this time.

65
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,156
We want to know where he's going
and who he's selling it to.

66
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:36,155
- lt's drugs?
- We're not DEA.

67
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,032
We appreciate
your co-operation on this.

68
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,153
l checked with Washington,
Fulbright's kosher.

69
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,993
He's working
on something classified.

70
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:50,789
lf they want these guys loose
we should close the investigation.

71
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,509
Fuck them. l want the man
that killed Todd. What you got?

72
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,878
Not a hell of a lot.
The dead mechanics were executed.

73
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,269
Only one was strapped,
he was still holstered.

74
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,079
The bodies of the shooters
had 30,000 cash.

75
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,470
- High-price heat.
- San Diego drivers' licenses.

76
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:12,315
San Diego PD's sheet says enforcers
for hire for Tijuana drug dealers.

77
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,913
lt's about drugs?

78
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,028
An attaché case had a towel from
the Wonder World Hotel, California.

79
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,511
Wonder World? Did you check out
that car they shot Todd from?

80
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,195
Rental from the airport.
The renter's a Dr Oliver Hirsch.

81
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,838
- A stolen lD?
- Yeah.

82
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:32,356
Doctor said it was lifted
while in an amusement park.

83
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,830
- l hope the park was Wonder World.
- Yeah.

84
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:41,518
- Excuse me.
- Wonder World.

85
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,350
l understand
that you were with him at the end.

86
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,352
Yeah. His last words were about you.

87
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:58,311
That does not sound
like my Douglas, Axel. Try again.

88
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,629
Actually, his last words were,

89
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,838
''Axel, are you on a coffee break?
Go and get that son of a bitch.''

90
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,876
Those were his last words.

91
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:17,113
- That sounds like my Douglas.
- lt sounds like a good idea, too.

92
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,479
Hello, l'm looking
for Billy Rosewood.

93
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,028

99
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,391
Monsieur Rosewood? ln the house?

100
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,475
Le Rosewood. Moi le Rosewood.

101
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:17,914
''Monsieur était beau.
Le crayon. La table.''

102
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,232
Come in.

103
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,436
lt's open.

104
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,999
- Axel Foley!
- Billy, how you doing?

105
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:52,709
- l don't believe it.
- Look at your office! Look at this!

106
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,270
You got three windows,
venetian blinds, and a ficus.

107
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,557
One of them big, healthy
ficus in your office.

108
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:03,679
Not just the ficus. Look.

109
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,115
You got a refrigerator
in your office?

110
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,998
J Edgar Hoover
didn't have a refrigerator.

111
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,389
Just some hair curlers or something.

112
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:15,678
- Did they promote you to captain?
- l'm DDO-JSlOC.

113
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,479
The JG-Joe-Joe-C? What is that?

114
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,391
Deputy Director of Operations

115
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,632
for Joint Systems lnterdepartmental
Operational Command.

116
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,356
Here we are. Los Angeles. one of the
greatest cities in the world, Axel,

117
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,079
divided by its unique geography.

118
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:38,436
- Geography?
- LA is a vast metropolis

119
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:42,195
with social and economic imbalances
spread over an enormous distance.

120
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:46,432
A criminal hits Beverly Hills,
then West Hollywood, then downtown.

121
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:50,069
Whose responsibility is it?
Everybody's?

122
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,472
lmpossible. So it comes here. Every
crime that crosses the green line.

123
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,552
- The green line?
- Green lines of jurisdiction.

124
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,473
Beverly Hills,
West Hollywood, Santa Monica.

125
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:04,758
Officers respect these green lines,
but the criminal doesn't.

126
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:09,550
Whenever a criminal crosses green
lines, the DDO-JSlOC goes to work.

127
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,392
Very impressive, Billy.

128
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,438
l control the green lines,
and Axel...

129
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:18,832
whoever controls the green lines
controls Southern California.

130
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,590
You wanted to see me, Billy?

131
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:28,435
The sheriff's department nabbed
two guys pulling a stall-and-hook.

132
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,398
lt's the same MO
as those jobs on Melrose.

133
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,630
l'll run out there and talk to them.

134
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:37,030
They're in Van Nuys.
l'll tell them you're coming.

135
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,588
Jon, l want you
to meet a friend of mine.

136
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,148
Axel Foley. Axel, Jon Flint.

137
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,358
How are you? l've heard about you.
You're from Detroit, right?

138
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:50,638
- Taggart talked about you.
- Taggart! Where is he?

139
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,836
Taggart's retired to Phoenix.

140
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:56,879
Spends his days lost in the woods
looking for his golf balls.

141
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,388
That's a dream
l'm not too far from myself.

142
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,711
What brings you to California?
Vacation?

143
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:07,395
- l'm looking for a killer.
- ln Beverly Hills?

144
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,790
- No. Wonder World.
- Wonder World?

145
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,758
You mean Rufus Rabbit
has gone berserko?

146
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,990
No. My boss got gunned down.

147
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,436
The killer escaped
in a cream-coloured Ford truck.

148
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,511
- l think it's here.
- Plates?

149
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,479
Plates were phoney. Some evidence
points to Wonder World.

150
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:28,836
l want to go to Wonder World
and ask some questions.

151
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:33,118
- Would y'all know somebody there?
- Ellis DeWald, head of security.

152
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,351
Biggest private
security force in America.

153
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:41,150
- Can you introduce me to him?
- Soon as l get back from Van Nuys.

154
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:44,835
You go on out. l'll call DeWald,
tell him you're coming.

155
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:48,629
- He's a pal of mine. l'll meet you.
- Great. Thanks.

156
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,678
You'll love Wonder World,
it's a great place.

157
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,355
Axel, don't forget,
we play by the rules around here.

158
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,079
l've heard Taggart's stories.

159
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,478
Which one of those green lines
is Wonder World behind?

160
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,549
Welcome to Wonder World. Can l help?

161
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,519
Yes, l'd like to talk to a park
executive, a Mr Ellis DeWald.

162
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:40,070
- Do you have an appointment?
- l'm supposed to. Axel Foley.

163
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,152
l'm sorry, sir.
l don't have you on the list.

164
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,276
Maybe they haven't called yet.

165
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:49,478
A Detective Flint was supposed
to call and get me squared away.

166
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:53,269
lf you don't have an appointment
you'll need a ticket.

167
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:58,876
- How much is a ticket?
- $35.

168
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,316
That allows you access
to all rides and attractions.

169
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,154
Wait a minute.
l don't want to go on any rides.

170
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,710
All l wanna do
is talk to the director of security.

171
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,553
Excuse me, sir,
would you step out of line?

172
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,352
- What line?
- Just step over here, please, sir.

173
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,431
Thank you.

174
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,677
- ls there a problem, sir?
- $35, that's the problem.

175
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,911
lf the admission seems high,
try Fantasy Park.

176
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,276
You might find
their ticket price to your liking.

177
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,477
l'm here to see Ellis DeWald.
ls he your boss?

178
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,313
Yes. Mr DeWald
is head of guest relations.

179
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:41,518
- Do you have an appointment?
- l'm supposed to.

180
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,717
Supposed to is not having,
is it, sir?

181
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,352
Excuse me.

182
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,992
- One, please.
- There you go. Thank you.

183
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,479
Thank you.

184
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,752
You should have your tailor
cut the jacket a little wider.

185
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,912
That way your gun
won't bulge in the back.

186
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,992
Thank you.

187
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,876
Uncle Dave.

188
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,358
What's going on?

189
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,834
''Alien Attack''?

190
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,192
Can l help you?

191
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,714
l was just curious
what Alien Attack is.

192
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,998
Watch.

193
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:13,151
Attention! This is a red alert.
Aliens are invading the city.

194
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:16,710
Board the subway trains
for immediate evacuation.

195
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,552
This is wild.

196
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,428
Yes. lt's one of
our more popular attractions.

197
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:03,717
Excuse me,
but what are you doing in here?

198
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:09,033
You're right. l gotta go. l have
a meeting, but thanks for the show.

199
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,554
Tunnel nine. Take a look.

200
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,555
- What should we do?
- l'll send Cooper. Get him.

201
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,716
Excuse me.

202
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:17,991
- That's not fair.
- Maintenance. Gotta grease a chain.

203
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,640
- Hear how dry it sounds?
- Sorry.

204
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,396
Come on. Let's go.

205
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,631
- Hi, Mom!
- Up here!

206
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,759
- Hi, Mommy! Up here!
- We're here!

207
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,158
- Bring that man down.
- l can't until it goes all...

208
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,470
- Bring it down, damn it.
- Don't...

209
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,750
Don't. Don't! Jesus!

210
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,231
- What the hell?
- Oh, my God!

211
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,953
Code red on The Spider.

212
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,876
Wonder World? Axel!

213
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,630
Help!

214
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,437
Help! Please!

215
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,112
Shit!

216
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,352
My God. Look!

217
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:43,077
- Are you all right?
- l'm OK, just don't let go.

218
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,559
All units near Wonder World,

219
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,438
proceed to assist
in emergency rescue.

220
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,314
You see this rope? We're gonna
slide down it to the ground.

221
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:22,439
- We are?
- We're gonna try.

222
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,196
Come up and hold on to my neck.

223
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,590
Come on. lt's OK.

224
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:40,397
You gonna grab onto my neck really
tight. Come on. Hold on really tight.

225
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,675
Not too tight!

226
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,830
Give me your hand.

227
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:57,550
Come on. None of that.
Give me your hand. Come on. lt's OK.

228
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,198
Come on.

229
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,075
Hang on tight!

230
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,675
Come on. Come on up.

231
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:59,195
Our head of security confirmed your
identity with the Detroit police.

232
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,640
But neither they nor l...

233
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,878
..understand what
you're doing at Wonder World.

234
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,235
l'm investigating a crime.

235
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,675
l've been here 10 minutes
and l've already been shot at.

236
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,991
Yes. Some of our
guest relations people, you said.

237
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,751
Miss Perkins is here
with the surveillance tapes.

238
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:23,195
Send her right in.

239
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:34,751
This starts in The Spider
maintenance tunnel.

240
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:41,593
There l am,
coming down the tunnel.

241
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:48,799
- What is that?
- Tracking. The monitors are looped.

242
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:56,037
- l don't see any gunmen, Mr Foley.
- So who was l shooting at?

243
00:32:56,120 --> 00:33:00,113
You better think about a lawyer.
The tapes don't show your gunman.

244
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,316
They don't show something else,

245
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:07,599
Mr Foley's courage when the ride
malfunctioned. He risked his life.

246
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,159
They don't show that.

247
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:14,678
That would be very impressive,
if you didn't cause the malfunction.

248
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:18,639
- Mr DeWald.
- Send him in.

249
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,835
Mr Foley, Mr DeWald.

250
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:25,512
You fuck! Motherfucker...
That's him!

251
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:29,080
That's the fucking guy
l'm looking for!

252
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,116
What's going on here?

253
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,714
He shot a Detroit police officer
last weekend!

254
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:38,510
Last weekend? l was at my
beach house in Laguna last weekend.

255
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,591
Your beach home in Laguna?

256
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,989
Wait. l think l got the wrong guy.

257
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,913
l'm sorry.
This is a big misunderstanding.

258
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,956
You were at your beach...

259
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,952
Fuck! Beach house in Laguna!
You motherfucker!

260
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:55,953
- Miss Bruce, call the police.
- They just walked in.

261
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:03,359
- That guy! That's the killer!
- Ellis DeWald?

262
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,595
We really appreciate this, Ellis.

263
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:16,036
Your friend is lucky Mr Sanderson
doesn't want any publicity.

264
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:21,274
You just keep him and his delusions
out of my face and out of my park.

265
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:26,195
No problem. You got it. By the way,
are we still on for Sunday?

266
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,151
Bring your money, sucker.

267
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:32,437
All right. When you have
some time, l'd like to...

268
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,670
Not right now. Later, perhaps.

269
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,716
Thanks.

270
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,476
Here we go.

271
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,192
Thank you.

272
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,875
And the usual for you, Billy.

273
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:59,069
- Thanks a lot.
- lsn't it possible you're mistaken?

274
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,437
That Ellis DeWald
just resembles Todd's killer?

275
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,239
l made the guy in Detroit.
lt was DeWald.

276
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:11,872
He's the head of the largest private
police department in California.

277
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:17,398
He works with us, with the governor's
office. Everybody loves him.

278
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:22,076
He's getting an award from the
Association of Security Agencies.

279
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,557
lt's understandable
that you're distraught

280
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,837
and looking for justice,
not to mention revenge.

281
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,879
But isn't it just possible
that you want it so much

282
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:37,430
that you saw your killer in a man
who bore a slight resemblance?

283
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,910
We run into this
all the time in police work.

284
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,833
- Where's he getting that award?
- Don't!

285
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:47,549
Flint, your friend DeWald is foul.
l know he's foul,

286
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:51,553
and l'm going to this awards show
to put some pressure on him.

287
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,598
Maybe panic him
into doing something stupid.

288
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:57,831
Axel, if you go
to that dinner tonight...

289
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:02,710
- l'm going with you.
- Pick me up at the Sunset Motel.

290
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,996
Freeze, motherfucker!

291
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:44,109
- Detective Foley?
- You're Uncle Dave!

292
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,078
Oh, my God. l almost shot Uncle Dave!

293
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:52,597
l'm so embarrassed. l'm sorry.
Nice to meet you! Uncle Dave!

294
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:55,558
The front desk let us in.
l hope that's OK.

295
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:58,712
No, it's fine. lt's Uncle Dave!

296
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,997
Uncle Dave! Have a seat.

297
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,514
- Thank you.
- l was such a fan of yours.

298
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,955
- Thank you, son.
- Uncle Dave...

299
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:13,559
You're very kind. Detective Foley,
what's going on at my park?

300
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:16,757
- There's something going on?
- l have no doubts.

301
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:19,957
- What?
- l have no doubts,

302
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,235
nor do l have any ideas.

303
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,995
Exactly two weeks ago,
Detective Foley,

304
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:30,551
Roger Fry, the park's
chief operating officer...

305
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,393
and my friend, disappeared.

306
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:38,713
Roger Fry designed the park, from the
landscaping to the concession stands.

307
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,872
- What do you mean, disappeared?
- Show him the note.

308
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,357
l received this interoffice
the day Roger disappeared.

309
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,318
''This is important,
life and death. Roger''

310
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,715
- What was so important?
- l don't know.

311
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,360
What was he doing
the day he disappeared?

312
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:00,638
He was probably doing
one of his usual inspections.

313
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:05,829
- This guy designed the whole park?
- Yes.

314
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:11,914
- And he knew the place cold?
- Of course.

315
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,956
So what are you thinking?

316
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:17,635
He must've found something
someone didn't want him to find.

317
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:21,474
At Wonder World?
What on earth could that be?

318
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:24,472
lt's a place
of childhood innocence and fun.

319
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,629
And life and death.

320
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:34,399
You met Uncle Dave? Uncle Dave.

321
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:40,559
l don't believe it. l'd give
anything to have been with you.

322
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,279
- Did he do the Oki-Doki Shuffle?
- No.

323
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,236
Outstanding.

324
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:01,153
- William Rosewood, DDO-JSlOC.
- l beg your pardon?

325
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,669
This is me. Thank you.

326
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:12,160
What you gonna do with this shit?

327
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:17,868
No way.
l don't believe this! Ackwell!

328
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:24,713
Ackwell Folee! Ackwell Folee, you
crazy thing. What you doing here?

329
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,077
- ''Surge.''
- Serge.

330
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:33,629
Look at your head!
l love it short!

331
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:37,474
- Yeah, Serge.
- Turn around. Turn around.

332
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:41,633
You look perfect! And finally
you have black ''Hush Poopies'',

333
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:45,315
which are totally retro.
You put a good package together.

334
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,598
- You remember Billy Rosewood.
- Billy, l remember you.

335
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,591
- Do you remember?
- Of course.

336
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:56,309
l made you an espresso at
the art gallery with a lemon twist?

337
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,035
lt was the last one l ever made.

338
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:02,793
lt's terrible, espresso.
You know why?

339
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,395
lt stain your teeth. l won't
show you mine. Show me your teeth.

340
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,355
They're so pretty.
Can l see your teeth?

341
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,511
And you got healthy gums.

342
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,670
- Do you do colonics?
- Excuse me?

343
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,035
- Do you do colonics?
- No. Never...

344
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:20,793
- lt's my new favourite!
- You dig colonics?

345
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,952
- They stick a hose up inside you...
- l know...

346
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,996
No, you've got to understand.

347
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:29,675
Out comes a candy bar
from when you were five!

348
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:35,313
- What happened to your art gallery?
- lt is completely bankrupt,

349
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,675
in the toilet. Why?

350
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:41,673
Because we had an owner who was
obstinate and stupid and ignorant.

351
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,513
- You shot him, remember?
- Yes. l shot him.

352
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:47,592
- What are you doing now?
- l'm doing guns. Come!

353
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:54,073
This is my booth.
The Survival Boutique.

354
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:59,359
We are doing weapons and protective
devices and products for survival

355
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,079
in the helter-skelter world of today.

356
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:06,470
One thing's very important.
At the Survival Boutique,

357
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:11,759
it's my philosophy that everything
must conform to the three P's.

358
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:15,150
Which is protection,
prestige and pretty.

359
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,788
Why should you look ugly
if you're just trying to survive?

360
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:25,556
You should maintain your style
and be safe. Guess what this is.

361
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,712
ls look like a key chain,
but it's so much more.

362
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:33,509
lt's called a stunner.
lt is designed by an ex-Navy SEAL.

363
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,398
Very serious individual,
l never see him smile.

364
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,040
Also l never see him
in pants that fit.

365
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,832
Someone comes up to you
who is a carjacker.

366
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:48,196
Do you want to die for your Camry?
l don't think so.

367
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:51,113
So you say -
a little bit of deception -

368
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,873
''l want to separate
my house and car keys.

369
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:57,350
''l'll just push this button, OK?''
And he says, ''OK.''

370
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:01,718
And then you push this button,
and out it comes from the mechanism,

371
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:05,270
the brightest, blinding light
ever that you seeing.

372
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,430
He cannot see. He's like this.

373
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,954
Everyone is come running
to help you.

374
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:12,952
And once again,
you have survived with style.

375
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:15,110
That's cool.

376
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:19,159
Billy, l want to give you one
for a present.

377
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,992
Thank you.

378
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:24,516
And, Ackwell, l want to give you one
because l worry about you.

379
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:28,388
- l want you to be safe.
- Thanks.

380
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:32,871
Now l'll show you something that
is going to blow your rocks off.

381
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:37,431
lt's absolutely orgasmic
and my most thing that l'm proud of.

382
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:42,150
lt's the most up-to-date, the
ultimate survival tool for today.

383
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:48,354
A new generation of luxury personal
weaponry, the Annihilator 2000

384
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:52,911
is America's premier survival,
home and travel security unit.

385
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,879
The Annihilator 2000
is a high-performance weapon

386
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:01,272
that meets the demands
of upper income urban survivalists.

387
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:04,113
The Annihilator 2000
has the conveniences

388
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:07,158
of a cellphone,
fax and microwave oven.

389
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,678
Night-vision goggles,
microprocessor,

390
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:15,753
verbal alarm systems,
compact disc player, digital radio,

391
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:19,879
video camera and playback functions
are just a few features

392
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:22,315
of the extraordinary
Annihilator 2000.

393
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,516
You think those are real?

394
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:27,876
Stopping power
is a matter of convenience.

395
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:35,397
That's Dodi, my personal trainer.
She can bench-press 200lbs.

396
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,915
She's working on reducing
my body fat, but it's difficult

397
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,551
because l keep sneaking goat cheese.
l don't care. l wear suits.

398
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:48,189
The Annihilator 2000
is constructed of aluminium alloy

399
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:52,637
combined with polymer technology,
totally resistant to corrosion.

400
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,630
A new generation in luxury personal
weaponry, the Annihilator 2000

401
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:04,475
is America's premier survival,
home and travel security unit.

402
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,278
Who's gonna buy that shit?

403
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:10,831
Are you joking? This is LA.
l'm selling hundreds of these.

404
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:14,549
- Get the fuck outta here!
- No, because l am telling you,

405
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:17,552
l sell 10 of these
to Jackie Stallone.

406
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:20,757
- Get the fuck outta here.
- Sly bought 1 4.

407
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:23,354
Zsa Zsa Gabor has one...

408
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,670
- We gotta go, Surge.
- Thanks.

409
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,991
Ackwell, try to say Serge.
lt's not so difficult.

410
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:30,638
''Surge'' sounds like a detergent.

411
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:44,197
What are you gonna do?

412
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:47,556
Nothing.
l just wanna hear the man speak.

413
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:55,038
To keep a park like Wonder World
a safe, wholesome, family environment

414
00:44:55,120 --> 00:45:00,069
in difficult times like these
is an enormous challenge.

415
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:05,994
But my friend Ellis DeWald
has done just that.

416
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:14,279
Couple that with Ellis' work
with underprivileged kids,

417
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:18,558
some of whom are seated at the
head table right now with Ellis...

418
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:35,477
..and you can understand
why he's our award winner.

419
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:39,678
So let's bring him up here.
Head of security at Wonder World

420
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,991
and private law enforcement's
Man of the Year award winner,

421
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:45,230
my dear friend, Ellis DeWald.

422
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:02,069
- Congratulations. You deserve it.
- Thank you, Orrin.

423
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,515
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, Mike.

424
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:22,911
You're not gonna do nothing.
You never do nothing.

425
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,959
Thank you very much.
You know, a lot of nice things happen

426
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:30,350
when you work at a nice place
like Wonder World,

427
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:34,592
especially when your bosses
are people like Orrin Sanderson

428
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:39,754
and Uncle Dave Thornton. l don't
think that Uncle Dave would mind

429
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:44,868
if l said that this is
the nicest thing yet.

430
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,916
Thank you very much.

431
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:54,829
Please don't do this, Axel.
Please don't do it. Don't do it.

432
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:57,229
- Bravo! Bravo!
- Don't do it.

433
00:46:57,320 --> 00:47:00,392
Bravo, Ellis DeWald! Ellis DeWald!

434
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:09,631
Ellis DeWald, ladies and gentlemen!

435
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:11,950
Ellis DeWald! Y'all keep it going!

436
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:15,510
Keep it going for Ellis DeWald!
Come on, it's Ellis!

437
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:21,034
You're not clapping loud enough!
This is Ellis DeWald!

438
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:26,911
Ladies and gentlemen,
l've travelled from Detroit

439
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,549
to be with this man tonight,
to honour this man tonight.

440
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:34,030
My name is Axel Foley.
l'm a Detroit police officer.

441
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:38,238
lt is a tremendous surprise
for Mr DeWald to have me next to him.

442
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:40,276
l can feel his body tingling!

443
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:44,592
But, ladies and gentlemen,
there's not a night that goes by

444
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:48,355
that l don't think about
what l owe Ellis DeWald.

445
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:52,399
And there's not a night that passes
that l don't think about

446
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:56,029
what the people of Detroit
owe Ellis DeWald.

447
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:59,590
And l'd like to say,
when l see y'all give him this...

448
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:02,274
What's this? That's beautiful...

449
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:05,397
''With gratitude
for community service.''

450
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:08,233
And l'm going to do
the community a service

451
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:11,357
because l'm going
to pay back Ellis DeWald

452
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:14,193
everything we owe him with interest!

453
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:26,754
Go on, smile.
Get them last few smiles in.

454
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:30,833
What's the matter? You mad at me
for shooting your boyfriend?

455
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:43,915
l got him! l got him! l got him!

456
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:51,677
You and Billy
disturbing the peace? No!

457
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:55,672
Just make your phone call
and get us out of here.

458
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:59,673
Sure. Who do l know
down there? Let's see.

459
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,716
Don't fuck with me right now.

460
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:04,155
Keep your shirt on.
l'll get you out.

461
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:07,357
lncidentally,
we found that truck you wanted.

462
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:10,635
- Where?
- By the Santa Monica pier.

463
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:13,871
l'm headed there now.
l'll pick you up on the way.

464
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:17,111
ln the meantime,
don't take any showers.

465
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:29,953
l'm all washed-up. Dead in the water.

466
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:33,271
Stop worrying.
Flint's going to get us out.

467
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:35,920
l really liked that office.

468
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,993
- Foley! You're out of here.
- That was quick.

469
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:43,398
Not him, just you.

470
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:51,271
Come in.

471
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:04,909
Thank you, officer.

472
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:10,070
l ran a check on you, Foley.

473
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:15,509
You're a hell of a detective,
but something of a maverick.

474
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,520
l know what you're doing.
l know the drill.

475
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:27,351
You hassle DeWald, you get him
to panic, make a rash move...

476
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:32,672
But God damn it, Foley,
we do not want to panic this man.

477
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:38,995
We want him doing business as fucking
usual. Do you copy me, Foley?

478
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:50,273
Ticket to Detroit, first class,
courtesy of the Federal Government.

479
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:52,555
Also, my card.

480
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:57,191
Should you have any more thoughts
about DeWald, let us handle it.

481
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:07,115
l give you my word as a gentleman
l'll be on that plane.

482
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:19,232
Truck was spotted
by an LAPD traffic officer.

483
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:22,949
lt's a different colour
but the same make and model.

484
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:27,033
Read you. Out. Beach leader, over?

485
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:29,475
Negatory, SWAT,
hold for our arrival.

486
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:32,677
ETA...1 1 minutes. Out.

487
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:36,516
Billy, who were you talking to?

488
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:39,194
Truck was inside
the county green line,

489
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,794
so l co-ordinated
with the SMPD, BHPD,

490
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:46,396
LAPD, sheriff of Los Angeles County,
Parks and Recreation,

491
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:51,508
Highway Patrol, district attorney's
office and US Naval Shore Patrol.

492
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:04,509
Beach leader to team one. Proceed.

493
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,436
All teams standing ready...

494
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,558
Go! Go! Go!

495
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:45,152
Area secured.

496
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:57,916
Lab says these are the same
fibres as the truck upholstery.

497
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:02,994
No help there. Some sand, probably
blew in after it was abandoned.

498
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:09,756
l just had a very unpleasant
conversation with my superiors.

499
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:12,593
- About being busted?
- No.

500
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:16,832
There was some objection to my use
of manpower on Operation Truck Siege.

501
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:24,355
- What is it?
- You got a $50 bill?

502
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:27,477
l'm married with kids.
l haven't seen a 50 in 1 2 years.
