1
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,949
- Don't touch me.
- I'm chatting to you.

2
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:59,874
- Shut up.
- Where you going? Where you going?

3
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,226
There better be something
in your fucking eye, blood.

4
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:09,556
- Who the fuck are you?
- Balance, man.

5
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,950
Hey! That car's shabby, blood.

6
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,425
- Who's my man looking at, though?
- Fucking kids.

7
00:02:18,525 --> 00:02:21,070
Why is he showing what he's got,
like he's a big man?

8
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:22,218
- He's an idiot, man.

9
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:24,465
A man like that ain't nothing around here.

10
00:02:24,565 --> 00:02:28,185
You know what? Fuck it, let's jack
this bre, man. Are you man on it?

11
00:02:28,285 --> 00:02:31,229
Course. That man there
should be sharing the wealth, man.

12
00:02:31,329 --> 00:02:33,189
Yeah, I'm on it still.

13
00:02:33,289 --> 00:02:35,266
- Me and you, Dabs, yeah?
- What?

14
00:02:35,366 --> 00:02:38,341
Yeah. All right.
Yous two wait here.

15
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,826
Come on... Nah, man. Am I a dickhead?
Why am I waiting here for?

16
00:02:41,926 --> 00:02:46,176
This happens all the time.
Am I a dickhead, though?

17
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,985
I'll take the passenger side.

18
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,065
Come on. For fuck's sake.

19
00:02:52,165 --> 00:02:54,165
Come on.

20
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:02,945
- Fuck! What are you doing, you fuckers?
- Let go of me, blood!

21
00:03:03,045 --> 00:03:05,345
You fuckers! What are you doing?
You fuckers!

22
00:03:05,445 --> 00:03:07,445
It's a fucking gun!

23
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,625
Argh!

24
00:03:09,725 --> 00:03:12,509
Argh! Argh!

25
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,426
- What you get?
- Watch. What'd you get?

26
00:03:14,526 --> 00:03:16,590
- Nothing.

27
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,875
Fuckers!

28
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,895
Hey, keep your chin up.
Stay out of trouble.

29
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,665
Say my name!
It's Jay, on a hot thing!

30
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,600
What, my man?

31
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:49,825
I told you,
I'll blow your man later, innit.

32
00:03:49,925 --> 00:03:52,427
- Jay, get off the phone.
- Hold on, man.

33
00:03:52,527 --> 00:03:54,868
I'm banging at that Polly gash.

34
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:57,185
No, not that one, blood,
the one from...

35
00:03:57,285 --> 00:03:59,505
- Yeah, yeah...
- Jay! I'm gonna be late for uni.

36
00:03:59,605 --> 00:04:02,230
Can't you see I'm busy, like?

37
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:06,940
I'm a business, babe. Like a doctor.
I gotta be on call. You get me?

38
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,345
Hey, blood.
I beg you bell me back, yeah?

39
00:04:09,445 --> 00:04:11,445
Safe.

40
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,029
What did you want to tell me
that's so important it can't wait?

41
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:17,584
Can you at least pay attention to me
when we're fucking?

42
00:04:17,684 --> 00:04:19,745
Hey, listen, shut your mouth, man.

43
00:04:19,845 --> 00:04:22,188
I do pay you attention, babe.

44
00:04:22,288 --> 00:04:25,487
Didn't we shave my name into your pussy...

45
00:04:25,587 --> 00:04:28,940
hair the other night,
huh? That's attention.

46
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,508
We'll finish off, yeah?

47
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,708
Aw! Has he gone to sleep?

48
00:04:39,808 --> 00:04:44,058
Oh, shut up, man!
This ain't happened to me before.

49
00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:46,139
Oh... maybe once.

50
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,840
Now, you better swallow.

51
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,760
Go away, man!

52
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:04,629
First day out, man.
So what you gonna do?

53
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,945
Dunno, blood.

54
00:05:08,045 --> 00:05:10,045
See my mum.

55
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,305
Just wanna have a peaceful day.

56
00:05:13,405 --> 00:05:16,030
You're simple, cuz, man.

57
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:21,353
I'm gonna get me a couple of girls,
get fucked all day, man.

58
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:27,685
Sweet boy like you must have a ting
you used to bang, man.

59
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Babe.

60
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,885
- Do you wanna get some breakfast?
- Yeah.

61
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,410
- See you soon then, mate.
- Fuck out, man.

62
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,390
Sam.

63
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,428
You need something... anything...

64
00:06:04,528 --> 00:06:07,027
just give me a bell
and I'll sort it, yeah?

65
00:06:07,127 --> 00:06:10,032
Yeah. Bless, Big Man.

66
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,268
Hey, Chinatown!

67
00:06:36,368 --> 00:06:38,548
You still owe me that fuck,
you know.

68
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:42,265
Now, your cousin said
if she couldn't pay, you would.

69
00:06:42,365 --> 00:06:45,426
So tomorrow,
my money, my drugs, or you.

70
00:06:45,526 --> 00:06:47,309
I gotta go work.

71
00:06:47,409 --> 00:06:50,870
- What?
- You gonna take that from her?

72
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,828
I remember that one chick.

73
00:06:53,928 --> 00:06:57,188
- I went back to her house, bruv.
- What happened?

74
00:06:57,288 --> 00:07:00,346
Her dad came home, innit,
so man had to jump out the window.

75
00:07:00,446 --> 00:07:03,868
I was running down the street in my
boxers and my socks. I was pissed.

76
00:07:03,968 --> 00:07:05,829
Oh, shit, you'd feel pissed...

77
00:07:05,929 --> 00:07:09,754
- Sorry, would you like to sit down?
- Thanks.

78
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,400
You cool, blood?

79
00:08:27,474 --> 00:08:29,990
Yeah, I'm bless, man. You?

80
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:32,268
Yeah, man.

81
00:08:32,368 --> 00:08:34,368
I'm good.

82
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,640
I'm Jahvon, blood.

83
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,280
Do I know you, cuz?

84
00:08:41,373 --> 00:08:42,670
No, bro.

85
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:44,868
Can't a man chat?

86
00:08:44,968 --> 00:08:47,348
Yeah, man, safe.
Talk, innit.

87
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,109
It's not safe, though.

88
00:08:51,209 --> 00:08:55,346
What you move for? We're having a little
chat - I chat to you, you chat to me.

89
00:08:55,446 --> 00:08:57,911
What you getting nervous for?

90
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,895
Just come out of jail, man.

91
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,945
That shouldn't make you feel nervous.

92
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,039
That should make you feel good.

93
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,358
What'd you go in for?

94
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,230
What'd you go in for, blood? !

95
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,749
I don't wanna chat about it.

96
00:09:23,849 --> 00:09:26,065
Bet I guess what you went in for.

97
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:28,549
Don't tell me, let me guess.

98
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,589
I think you hurt someone.

99
00:09:34,689 --> 00:09:37,592
I'm thinking someone died.

100
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,388
Like you killed them or something.

101
00:09:40,488 --> 00:09:43,633
You're a clever one,
ain't you, blood?

102
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,428
I don't think you stabbed no one, though.

103
00:09:46,528 --> 00:09:49,549
You don't look like the type.

104
00:09:49,649 --> 00:09:52,307
If you was gonna do something to a bre,

105
00:09:52,407 --> 00:09:55,212
I think you'd use a baseball bat.

106
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,165
- Low it, man. Low it!
- My fucking cousin, blood!

107
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,267
What's this about, blood?
What's it about?

108
00:10:30,367 --> 00:10:33,868
You ain't gonna survive this day.
I guarantee it!

109
00:10:33,968 --> 00:10:36,424
Man's coming for you.

110
00:10:36,524 --> 00:10:38,947
Your mum, your family, everything!

111
00:10:39,047 --> 00:10:41,787
Who's coming?
Who's gonna hurt my mum?

112
00:10:41,887 --> 00:10:43,887
Who, blood? Who?

113
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,116
Mum! Roy!

114
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,949
Come from yout offenders?

115
00:11:38,049 --> 00:11:40,547
What you in for?

116
00:11:40,647 --> 00:11:42,647
Killed one yout.

117
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,069
Don't feel you're big in here
just cos you killed someone.

118
00:11:46,169 --> 00:11:48,747
Enough man in here done that.

119
00:11:48,847 --> 00:11:52,927
Some of them man ain't even affected.
You get me?

120
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,669
You are.

121
00:11:54,769 --> 00:11:57,069
I can see it in your eyes.

122
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,877
Who gave you that black eye?

123
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,593
Listen, blood, watch them man.

124
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,590
See my man there?

125
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:13,426
They don't get on.

126
00:12:13,526 --> 00:12:18,116
Trust me, don't let any of them see
you're weak, blood.

127
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,880
You want something?

128
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,720
You keep watching me.

129
00:12:27,773 --> 00:12:33,298
Whenever you and your boyfriend
are ready, you can see what go on.

130
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,070
What's your dad's name, blood?

131
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,149
Dunno. I ain't got one. Why?

132
00:13:48,249 --> 00:13:50,428
Cos, like, my mum tried to introduce me

133
00:13:50,528 --> 00:13:54,225
to some broke-down yellow-teeth
waste man, yeah, called Cedric.

134
00:13:54,325 --> 00:13:57,865
And hear this - he's coming into my house
telling me about how he's my dad.

135
00:13:57,965 --> 00:14:00,946
But I'm like,
"You're not my fucking dad."

136
00:14:01,046 --> 00:14:04,266
He had that ting Michael Jackson
said he's got. He looked like a panda.

137
00:14:04,366 --> 00:14:06,947
I said, "Move from my house
with your polka-dot skin..."

138
00:14:07,047 --> 00:14:09,713
Why's he taking so long, man?

139
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,948
Yeah!

140
00:14:12,048 --> 00:14:15,745
I swear my maths teacher
lives somewhere round here.

141
00:14:15,845 --> 00:14:17,746
And she's buff, blood.
I wanna fuck that.

142
00:14:17,846 --> 00:14:20,470
I could quote algebra
while I'm in the pussy.

143
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:23,227
Q=Z means "Yeah!"

144
00:14:23,327 --> 00:14:27,577
Get me? Why do you think
she's always giving me As?

145
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,829
You don't get As, blood.

146
00:14:29,929 --> 00:14:31,267
- Who don't?
- Fool.

147
00:14:31,367 --> 00:14:35,057
Don't get it twisted.
Just cos I'm with you,

148
00:14:35,157 --> 00:14:38,217
don't think I'm stupid. I got plans.

149
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,707
Although I might have to bang
my English teacher as well.

150
00:14:41,807 --> 00:14:44,068
Who? Mr Randall? You batty...

151
00:14:44,168 --> 00:14:46,545
No, man. Shut up.
It's a woman, man. You know that.

152
00:14:46,645 --> 00:14:52,595
- Yo, blood, it's broad daylight, man!
- If you're shook, leave, innit.

153
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,960
Yes, Ike.

154
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,549
What you man got?

155
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,308
That ain't fake, man.
I got it last night.

156
00:15:35,408 --> 00:15:37,907
I'll give you six for both tings.

157
00:15:38,007 --> 00:15:40,309
What?
Six, blood.

158
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,630
You know what? I'll throw in a piece
of yay each. You'll have to wait, though.

159
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:49,908
I gotta go, bruv.
I got a mark-up booked, innit.

160
00:15:50,008 --> 00:15:52,389
Safe, man. We'll wait here.

161
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,345
All right, later, you man.

162
00:16:00,445 --> 00:16:02,825
You man wait here.

163
00:16:02,925 --> 00:16:04,925
Yeah, yeah.

164
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,194
Yeah, come we play this.

165
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,949
- Hey, pass the controller.
- Tss!

166
00:16:12,049 --> 00:16:14,026
- What? !
- You deaf, blood?

167
00:16:14,126 --> 00:16:17,271
He said pass the controller.
You fool.

168
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,475
Hey, I'm Arsenal, blood.

169
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,345
Who was it?

170
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:30,740
Omen and Dabs and them man.

171
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,910
So you understand
what I was saying to you before?

172
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:41,905
Yeah.

173
00:16:42,005 --> 00:16:44,789
Even my man had to
learn the hard way, you know.

174
00:16:44,889 --> 00:16:46,889
See this?

175
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,066
Some fucker done that to me.

176
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:53,987
You're all right.
I'm not into face-cutting.

177
00:16:54,087 --> 00:16:57,625
Something about the face
makes people too angry.

178
00:16:57,725 --> 00:17:00,467
But he was right to do what he did.

179
00:17:00,567 --> 00:17:03,712
I took the fucking piss like you are.

180
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,755
You know what, blood?

181
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,930
I don't even know this Curtis brother. Hm?

182
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:20,400
But he was trying to do his ting.
You understand?

183
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,509
And Andreas here, he fucked up.

184
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,850
And now us man,
we're trying to do our little ting.

185
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,830
And you are fucking up.
You understand?

186
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:37,906
- Yeah, bruv, but I was...
- Uh.

187
00:17:38,006 --> 00:17:40,789
Listen, we like you, blood.

188
00:17:40,889 --> 00:17:43,155
I like you.

189
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:49,356
But I can't have you
making money off of my shit.

190
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,873
- It's mine.
- I... I...

191
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,790
Now you're gonna have to learn, blood.

192
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,400
Argh!

193
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,830
Oh, fuck! Argh!

194
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,920
Safe.

195
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,707
Where'd you park?

196
00:18:35,807 --> 00:18:38,068
About three roads away.

197
00:18:38,168 --> 00:18:40,029
Come on, we'll have a walk.

198
00:18:40,129 --> 00:18:43,149
I've got to meet Jon and Vern at the shop.

199
00:18:43,249 --> 00:18:46,394
You're one lazy cow,
do you know that?

200
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:49,466
I'll go and get it and them,
then I'll come back and get you, yeah?

201
00:18:49,566 --> 00:18:51,566
- Yeah.
- Giz a kiss.

202
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,838
Unbelievable. Unbelievable.

203
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,426
Hayden!

204
00:19:13,526 --> 00:19:15,947
Shh!
Claire. Claire. Shh!

205
00:19:16,047 --> 00:19:19,069
I'm not gonna hurt you, I swear.
I just wanna speak to you.

206
00:19:19,169 --> 00:19:21,169
Hayden!

207
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,549
Promise me you're not gonna scream.
Promise?

208
00:19:25,649 --> 00:19:27,649
- Mm-hm.
- Yeah?

209
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,789
What do you want?

210
00:19:31,889 --> 00:19:36,426
Some bre attacked me when I come out.
Said people are gonna hurt me, my family.

211
00:19:36,526 --> 00:19:38,506
I don't want that.
I done my fucking time.

212
00:19:38,606 --> 00:19:42,145
- What'd you come to me for?
- Have you seen my mum anywhere?

213
00:19:42,245 --> 00:19:46,147
That was six years ago.
I haven't seen any of them.

214
00:19:46,247 --> 00:19:48,465
I haven't seen your mum in, like, a year.

215
00:19:48,565 --> 00:19:52,307
- What about my brother? You seen him?
- No!

216
00:19:52,407 --> 00:19:55,705
Claire, you must know something.
Just tell me anything, please.

217
00:19:55,805 --> 00:19:57,865
Moony goes Central University.

218
00:19:57,965 --> 00:20:00,829
That's all I know.
Now just fuck off and leave me alone.

219
00:20:00,929 --> 00:20:05,277
I don't wanna get involved in any of this.

220
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,705
- D'you want something?
- Mind your business.

221
00:20:10,805 --> 00:20:13,695
What?
Who the fucking hell are you?

222
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,307
- Do you know him? Is he bothering you?
- Yeah.

223
00:20:17,407 --> 00:20:20,668
All right, jog on, bruv, yeah?
Do yourself a favour and fuck off.

224
00:20:20,768 --> 00:20:23,267
Hey, blood, don't fucking touch me!

225
00:20:23,367 --> 00:20:25,628
What part of me
looks like your fucking blood?

226
00:20:25,728 --> 00:20:27,728
Sam, just fuck off.

227
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,308
Sam? Fucking Sam?
Fucking Sam, yeah?

228
00:20:31,408 --> 00:20:34,988
She still has nightmares because of you.
She flinches if I move too quickly.

229
00:20:35,088 --> 00:20:38,907
- You fucking wrong 'un!
- I'm just talking to her. I've finished.

230
00:20:39,007 --> 00:20:41,587
- Leave it.
- I'm all right, mate. I'm all right.

231
00:20:41,687 --> 00:20:47,977
Like you said, you're finished, so do
yourself a favour and fuck off. Yeah?

232
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,784
Go and get in the car, babe.

233
00:20:54,884 --> 00:20:56,884
You've had a squeeze.

234
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,440
Hey, babe.

235
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:54,389
Robert, you know we've got basic ethics
and understanding of law on Monday?

236
00:21:54,489 --> 00:21:57,349
I could really use some help
getting my head around it.

237
00:21:57,449 --> 00:22:03,940
Yeah, of course. Anything I can do. Give
me your number and I'll give you a call.

238
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,845
- Thank you.
- I'll see you later?

239
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,480
Bye.

240
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:16,780
- Don't think you're calling her.
- Of course not, babe. You're my girl, man.

241
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,908
- So, how was your class?
- It was all right...

242
00:22:21,008 --> 00:22:23,008
Moony.

243
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:31,107
- How the fuck did you find me, blood?
- I saw Claire.

244
00:22:31,207 --> 00:22:34,947
She said you went to that uni
and I just asked a few people.

245
00:22:35,047 --> 00:22:37,068
- A guy try bore me up today.
- So?

246
00:22:37,168 --> 00:22:41,030
He's telling me mans is gonna hurt my
family because of what happened to Trife.

247
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:44,069
Don't mention his name.
You have no right to say his name.

248
00:22:44,169 --> 00:22:46,655
If it's you, if you're
involved in this, I just...

249
00:22:46,755 --> 00:22:48,785
wanna tell you that I'm not on it, blood.

250
00:22:48,885 --> 00:22:51,387
I'm not on dem tings no more.
We was all young.

251
00:22:51,487 --> 00:22:54,466
I'm just about my studies,
money and my girl.

252
00:22:54,566 --> 00:22:58,430
If you're not on it, you know how I feel.
Do you know where I can find them lot?

253
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:02,225
Just so I can tell them
I'm not into this beef ting.

254
00:23:02,325 --> 00:23:04,508
Saw Becky a couple of months ago.

255
00:23:04,608 --> 00:23:07,347
She works in that salon ting in Grove.

256
00:23:07,447 --> 00:23:10,309
Don't know where Alisa is, and Jay...

257
00:23:10,409 --> 00:23:15,105
You don't wanna see Jay. He ain't planned
nothing but he ain't forgotten you.

258
00:23:15,205 --> 00:23:20,267
Yeah? Why don't you give me his number
so I can tell him that I want this over?

259
00:23:20,367 --> 00:23:22,708
- Are you dumb, blood?
- Come on, man.

260
00:23:22,808 --> 00:23:26,105
What d'you mean, "Come on, man"?
Don't talk like we're fucking friends!

261
00:23:26,205 --> 00:23:30,506
You're any bre to me, understand? I ain't
forgiven you and I'm giving you nothing.

262
00:23:30,606 --> 00:23:34,176
Can you two leave,
or I'll call the police.

263
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,456

264
00:23:41,556 --> 00:23:44,785
mans like you don't get
out after six years!

265
00:23:44,885 --> 00:23:47,467
- Tell Jay I want to see him.
- Are you sure you want that?

266
00:23:47,567 --> 00:23:50,706
If I told Jay you're out,
you wouldn't need to look for him.

267
00:23:50,806 --> 00:23:53,951
He'll find you,
and he will want arms.

268
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,480
Dickhead!

269
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,300
It's a ball, but I suppose you can come.

270
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,988
You'd have to dress up a bit, mind you -
I've had the best week.

271
00:24:05,088 --> 00:24:06,986
I don't want your fucking life story.

272
00:24:07,086 --> 00:24:11,668
I told my friends you've got the best shit
on the street, cos that's what Giles does.

273
00:24:11,768 --> 00:24:14,906
Put your fucking hand down, blood.
You're baiting me up, man.

274
00:24:15,006 --> 00:24:17,906
I'm not being funny,
but I've got a barbecue to go to.

275
00:24:18,006 --> 00:24:19,507
Oh, shit!

276
00:24:19,607 --> 00:24:21,070
Just relax, man.

277
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:25,748
- Give me my shit before they come back.
- I told you to put your hand down.

278
00:24:25,848 --> 00:24:29,545
- Blood, if I had to run, yeah...
- Jason, don't be such a drama queen...

279
00:24:29,645 --> 00:24:33,068
What the fuck do you think...
You ain't getting shit, bruv.

280
00:24:33,168 --> 00:24:35,545
Oi! You! Stand by that pole! Now!

281
00:24:35,645 --> 00:24:40,505
Furthermore, yeah, take all your
fucking shit and put it in my bag, blood.

282
00:24:40,605 --> 00:24:43,427
What have you got on you, man?
What the fuck you got on you?

283
00:24:43,527 --> 00:24:45,346
Give me your fucking ring.

284
00:24:45,446 --> 00:24:48,469
Please! That's her engagement ring.
It's French 17th century.

285
00:24:48,569 --> 00:24:52,829
Shut the fuck up, man! Hurry up, blood.
Put the watch in the bag as well.

286
00:24:52,929 --> 00:24:55,507
Blood, hurry the fuck up
or I will shank you, man.

287
00:24:55,607 --> 00:24:58,985
Jay, just let us go. I'm a good customer.
I'll give you anything.

288
00:24:59,085 --> 00:25:02,269
You, blood? I don't need
your lickle business, man.

289
00:25:02,369 --> 00:25:05,868
You're anything to me, blood.
The amount of white man I get.

290
00:25:05,968 --> 00:25:09,069
What?
What, you think you're big, Giles?

291
00:25:09,169 --> 00:25:13,546
Show your yuppie girl you know where
to score to impress her? You're a pussy.

292
00:25:13,646 --> 00:25:18,406
Let me show you
what a little pussy you are, blood, yeah?

293
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,226
Show me your titties.

294
00:25:21,326 --> 00:25:24,226
Before I murk your man.

295
00:25:24,326 --> 00:25:28,151
For goodness' sake,
just show him the titties!

296
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,425
Run! Tammy, come on!

297
00:25:35,525 --> 00:25:39,180
Are you mad, bruv?
The fuck you doing, bruv?

298
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,490
The fuck you doing, man? !

299
00:25:43,558 --> 00:25:45,558
Hold on, yeah?

300
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,720
Hello? Jahvon.

301
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,189
What you saying, man?

302
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,066
What?

303
00:25:54,166 --> 00:25:56,987
Sam? What, at the cemetery?

304
00:25:57,087 --> 00:25:59,465
Where's he now?
Fuck him, blood!

305
00:25:59,565 --> 00:26:02,509
He's a dead man!
He's dead tonight.

306
00:26:02,609 --> 00:26:07,454
Nah. No, you go home, blood.
I'll get Moony and handle it.

307
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,829
You better thank God
something else has come up.

308
00:26:13,929 --> 00:26:17,465
- Well, thank him, then!
- Thank you, God! Oh, thank you, God.

309
00:26:17,565 --> 00:26:19,755
Get out of here, man.

310
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,240
Arsehole!

311
00:26:25,293 --> 00:26:27,293
Tammy!

312
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,665
Max? Can I just...
please nip out for a?

313
00:26:47,765 --> 00:26:52,015
Make sure you wash your hands
when you get back in.

314
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,907
Come outside.

315
00:27:00,007 --> 00:27:02,007
One second.

316
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:09,586
Hey, cokehead!
Where's your fucking cousin?

317
00:27:09,686 --> 00:27:12,869
- Think I don't know what she tried to do?
- Fuck off. Is this a joke?

318
00:27:12,969 --> 00:27:14,763
It ain't no joke. My man showed me that...

319
00:27:14,863 --> 00:27:16,744
she tried to move to
him at the drinks ting.

320
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:18,709
And you were there skinning your teeth.

321
00:27:18,809 --> 00:27:21,547
You thought because I was on holiday
I'd forget about it?

322
00:27:21,647 --> 00:27:24,429
Listen, your man
pushed himself up on us, yeah.

323
00:27:24,529 --> 00:27:27,788
If your tings ain't tight enough
to keep his dick pointed at you...

324
00:27:27,888 --> 00:27:30,430
She ain't even fucking worth it.
Where is she?

325
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:33,469
I don't fucking know where she is.
I don't care where she is.

326
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:38,947
Forget this. Find your fucking cousin and
both you get back to whoring yourselves.

327
00:27:39,047 --> 00:27:41,590
What? You think I don't know about you?
Listen.

328
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:43,586
We all know about you.

329
00:27:43,686 --> 00:27:47,747
Shiners for a fiver.
And you're fucking for a score.

330
00:27:47,847 --> 00:27:51,827
- I never did any of that.
- So what about for a bit of coke?

331
00:27:51,927 --> 00:27:54,747
Is that why I've heard
you've had all them dicks inside you?

332
00:27:54,847 --> 00:27:56,985
- You fuck... Ow!
- What you saying?

333
00:27:57,085 --> 00:27:59,085
Come off me, man.

334
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,229
- What the fuck is going on?
- She flipped out and attacked me.

335
00:28:04,329 --> 00:28:07,988
Anna, Lisa, go to lunch. Now! Go. OK!

336
00:28:08,088 --> 00:28:10,088
Yeah, that's...

337
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:14,385
Now, look, Lexi, I know
you've been a bit...

338
00:28:14,485 --> 00:28:17,309
stressed. I want you to
take a few days off.

339
00:28:17,409 --> 00:28:20,988
Please don't fire me! I need this job.
I can barely afford to pay my rent...

340
00:28:21,088 --> 00:28:26,104
I'm not going to fire you.
Come in on Tuesday. All right?

341
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:31,304
Today I want you to go in there,
get your stuff, and go home.

342
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:41,685
Sorry, ladies,
that will not happen again.

343
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,467
Can I speak to Becky, please?

344
00:28:44,567 --> 00:28:47,836
What do you want her for?
Who are you?

345
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,669
Jay.

346
00:28:50,769 --> 00:28:54,764
I don't wanna get involved, man.
I'm not scared.

347
00:28:54,837 --> 00:28:59,700
But I'm about positivity,
like that black Jedi guy from Star Wars.

348
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:06,300
All right, I'll see you later. I'll see you
at Hammersmith later. I'll be there, man!

349
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:09,546
- Robert, what is going on?
- Low it, babe, yeah?

350
00:29:09,646 --> 00:29:15,086
You don't remember me, do you?
Alex. Lexi, innit? Becky's cousin.

351
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:20,748
There's no reason you should. I was
two years younger and you was a cunt.

352
00:29:20,848 --> 00:29:23,667
I left in year 11
while you was still in sixth form.

353
00:29:23,767 --> 00:29:28,747
Picking on boys
and trying to fuck girls in year 10...

354
00:29:28,847 --> 00:29:32,710
- So what d'you wanna see her for?
- I thought she might know who's after me.

355
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:37,266
Yeah, she might, but I ain't seen her.
No one has. She's fucked off, innit.

356
00:29:37,366 --> 00:29:43,231
Look, yeah, I didn't know Trife well,
but... it's fucked-up he's dead.

357
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:47,346
- So do you know anything?
- Why the fuck would I know anything?

358
00:29:47,446 --> 00:29:50,150
I know some of them lot from school
and through her,

359
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:52,950
but not well enough to know
who's after you.

360
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:55,940
Or to give a fuck for that matter.

361
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,160
Well, that's it, innit?

362
00:30:02,253 --> 00:30:05,748
What else do you want me to say?
You've gone jail, come out - what?

363
00:30:05,848 --> 00:30:08,372
I ain't got nothing
against you, but I don't...

364
00:30:08,472 --> 00:30:10,668
think we got anything more to chat about.

365
00:30:10,768 --> 00:30:12,868
Ask that girl you was banging,
they was mates.

366
00:30:12,968 --> 00:30:16,585
Claire? I asked that chick already.
She don't know nothing.

367
00:30:16,685 --> 00:30:18,955
That girl was grimy.

368
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:23,468
Always losing her knickers. After lunch
she'd not know where she'd left 'em.

369
00:30:23,568 --> 00:30:27,265
I remember you now.
You was always on your own, innit?

370
00:30:27,365 --> 00:30:30,905
Yeah. My boyfriend went to a different
school, so I didn't chat with boys.

371
00:30:31,005 --> 00:30:33,145
Girls didn't like me, so...

372
00:30:33,245 --> 00:30:36,785
I got to the point where I did more things
to piss 'em off. You get me?

373
00:30:36,885 --> 00:30:41,305
Fuck it. If they ain't gonna love you,
make 'em hate.

374
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,867
I beg you a browns, Lex?

375
00:30:44,967 --> 00:30:46,626
Who's your friend?

376
00:30:46,726 --> 00:30:49,154
No. He ain't a friend.

377
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,400
Cool.

378
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,040
Yout!

379
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,826
- Safe for what you did, blood.
- I didn't do nothing, man.

380
00:31:04,926 --> 00:31:09,029
Listen, I ain't trying to be
spars with you, you know.

381
00:31:09,129 --> 00:31:13,825
You don't have to affiliate yourself
with me. I'm just saying safe, that's all.

382
00:31:13,925 --> 00:31:16,427
Don't worry about it, boys.
It gets better.

383
00:31:16,527 --> 00:31:20,789
I'm getting out tomorrow. Can't wait
to see my kids. You got any kids?

384
00:31:20,889 --> 00:31:23,609
Know anyone that's got any kids?

385
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,240
Suit yourself.

386
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,189
Oi, Lex! What about Alisa?

387
00:31:32,289 --> 00:31:35,027
You know some of them lot.
Can you get her to speak to me?

388
00:31:35,127 --> 00:31:40,065
I've not spoken to her but I could get her
number. You know she had a daughter?

389
00:31:40,165 --> 00:31:44,466
- Yeah. Can I have it?
- Her daughter? Oh, her number? No.

390
00:31:44,566 --> 00:31:47,706
I'll get to her, see if she wants
to chat to you, but I doubt it.

391
00:31:47,806 --> 00:31:50,627
I'm not high on the list of people
she wants to chat to either.

392
00:31:50,727 --> 00:31:53,589
Here what. I got my mum's mobes,
I'll give you the digits.

393
00:31:53,689 --> 00:31:58,194
I beg you bell mans
if she wants to speak or anything.

394
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,945
Yeah, safe for doing this, yeah?

395
00:32:07,045 --> 00:32:09,750
Hey, can you get any gear and that?
Like, cheap?

396
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:11,850
Nah, man.

397
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:16,920
Oi, what's it like
knowing you've killed someone?

398
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,585
Blood, I need that ting off you now.
I don't give a fuck.

399
00:32:34,685 --> 00:32:37,915
I want him dead.
I want him dead today.

400
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:48,225
Kill my boy. Now he's back in the ends
like he's big and I'm not gonna do nothing!

401
00:32:48,325 --> 00:32:51,198
Just cool down, man.

402
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,705
- I'll give you seven for everyting.
- Cool, man.

403
00:32:59,805 --> 00:33:04,628
- You gonna help me with this or what?
- Jay, man just got out of jail today.

404
00:33:04,728 --> 00:33:07,749
If something happens to him,
friends are gonna come for you.

405
00:33:07,849 --> 00:33:10,957
I don't care, blood. I'll go jail.

406
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:19,660
You know what, I'm gonna give you
the piece, cos me and you are boys.

407
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:31,268
Just don't bring no fucking drama
to my door, you hear me?

408
00:33:31,368 --> 00:33:33,368
Course not.

409
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,144
You just gotta understand,
do you get me?

410
00:33:37,244 --> 00:33:40,429
This boy... killed my tight bredren, man.

411
00:33:40,529 --> 00:33:43,506
Listen, why don't you buy
a couple of the boys we got?

412
00:33:43,606 --> 00:33:46,629
They'll do anything for a bit of cash.

413
00:33:46,729 --> 00:33:49,829
Why don't you get 'em to do the job
for you, save you the trouble?

414
00:33:49,929 --> 00:33:52,507
- And if they get caught, who gives a fuck?
- Who?

415
00:33:52,607 --> 00:33:55,709
Don't put no pussyholes on it
who'll take my money and not do nothing.

416
00:33:55,809 --> 00:33:59,185
This lot won't fuck about,
they're a tight little crew.

417
00:33:59,285 --> 00:34:01,665
- Omen, Dabs, and some others.
- Omen?

418
00:34:01,765 --> 00:34:04,065
Yeah. You know him?

419
00:34:04,165 --> 00:34:07,828
Nah, not really.
Why? Is he here?

420
00:34:07,928 --> 00:34:10,550
Dabs is still here.

421
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:14,068
- Go on, go through with Andre.
- Come on, then.

422
00:34:14,168 --> 00:34:16,710
Cuz, you're not on my level
on this game, man.

423
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:20,308
Cuz, why do you think they call me
King Henry, bruv? Check out the header.

424
00:34:20,408 --> 00:34:22,625
Look-look-look! Bang!
Check out the replay.

425
00:34:22,725 --> 00:34:26,547
- Mine's stuck.
- Nah! Check out the replay.

426
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:29,197
Hey, Dabs. Come through, mate.

427
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,756
Now, man. Come on.

428
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,716
Let me have that.

429
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,750
Mum?

430
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,828
How you doing, mum?

431
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,928
Everything OK, like?

432
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,760
Came out today.

433
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,330
Did you do that to the front door?

434
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,867
Yeah. I'm s... I'm sorry.

435
00:35:13,967 --> 00:35:18,060
I just needed... I needed to get in.
No one was home.

436
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,200
I mean, I'll pay for it.

437
00:35:20,273 --> 00:35:23,429
Gonna go try get a job.
I'll go Jobcentre or something.

438
00:35:23,529 --> 00:35:29,904
You know, cos we get taught stuff
in there. You can still get jobs and that.

439
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:34,120
I missed you, mum.

440
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,520
Some toast?

441
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,784
Let me get this straight. You want me
to get Omen, find this yout and murk him?

442
00:35:42,884 --> 00:35:44,884
Yeah.

443
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,548
- You sure you want him dead?
- Yes, man, are you deaf? Dead.

444
00:35:48,648 --> 00:35:51,307
- Why's he getting excited?
- Who the fuck you talking to?

445
00:35:51,407 --> 00:35:54,870
Look, let's just calm the fuck down.

446
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,109
Can you do it or what?

447
00:35:59,209 --> 00:36:01,419
What's in it for me, like?

448
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:06,305
Listen, I like the way
you been going on recently, blood.

449
00:36:06,405 --> 00:36:09,705
So what say you come flex
with me and Andre for a bit?

450
00:36:09,805 --> 00:36:14,990
Step up a bit, get a little piece
of what we're going on with.

451
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:18,025
You better watch yourself.

452
00:36:18,125 --> 00:36:20,675
All right, man.
I'm sorry, man.

453
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:22,469
Sorry, Ike, man.

454
00:36:22,569 --> 00:36:26,510
But come the fuck on. Kill a bre for just
that? You must think I'm any road yout.

455
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:28,469
- I ain't doing that.
- Listen!

456
00:36:28,569 --> 00:36:31,270
I'll give you three grand now.

457
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:35,310
And then three more when it's done.
I ain't chatting shit to you, all right?

458
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:38,045
Take the money and go find him.

459
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:45,220
- You know what? Seckle the fuck down.
- Blood, you need to watch your mouth!

460
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,710
- Who is it?
- Name's Sam Peel.

461
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:54,810
Sam Peel?

462
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,107
- You do know that...
- Don't worry about what I know.

463
00:36:58,207 --> 00:37:02,032
- Yeah, but...
- You still gonna do it, blood?

464
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,465
- Know what? Rag on.
- Good.

465
00:37:06,565 --> 00:37:09,067
And don't let the others know
who he is, blood.

466
00:37:09,167 --> 00:37:13,945
No, I mean it, blood. Don't even
let them mans see his face too tough.

467
00:37:14,045 --> 00:37:16,388
Just go get Omen and do your fucking job.

468
00:37:16,488 --> 00:37:19,269
You see him, you kill him.

469
00:37:19,369 --> 00:37:24,044
- You do know what he looks like, yeah?
- Course, blood.

470
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,266
He robbed me when I was nine.

471
00:37:26,366 --> 00:37:27,909
Yo, Henry!

472
00:37:28,009 --> 00:37:30,219
- We're gone, blood!
- Tss!

473
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:34,625
Don't forget I've got the title, blood.
I beat you eight times.

474
00:37:34,725 --> 00:37:36,349
That's Henry the Eighth.

475
00:37:36,449 --> 00:37:40,347
What's wrong with these kids nowadays? !
They ain't got no respect, blood.

476
00:37:40,447 --> 00:37:42,670
Always on a hype ting.

477
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,188
I didn't chat to my elders like that.

478
00:37:46,288 --> 00:37:48,288
Here you go.

479
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:54,030
So what's going on?

480
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:59,986
- They want us to kill someone.
- What? ! Who?

481
00:38:00,086 --> 00:38:02,099
- I ain't supposed to tell you, blood.

482
00:38:02,199 --> 00:38:04,429
Come on, blood, I ain't gonna tell no one.

483
00:38:04,529 --> 00:38:06,229
- Sam Peel.
- Who's that?

484
00:38:06,329 --> 00:38:07,949
- You don't know?
- No.

485
00:38:08,049 --> 00:38:12,186
But you know what, cuz, it don't even
matter. I ain't into all that stupidness.

486
00:38:12,286 --> 00:38:14,947
You told them it's all nonsense, yeah?

487
00:38:15,047 --> 00:38:17,867
You're thinking about it, innit?

488
00:38:17,967 --> 00:38:19,946
Blood, don't be stupid, man!

489
00:38:20,046 --> 00:38:23,266
When I tell Omen and Blammy
they're gonna laugh in your face.

490
00:38:23,366 --> 00:38:24,388
Tss!

491
00:38:24,488 --> 00:38:26,885
Ike and them must think we're dickheads.

492
00:38:26,985 --> 00:38:29,750
If you're thinking of
doing it, you're stupid.

493
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:31,586
Who the fuck you calling stupid?

494
00:38:31,686 --> 00:38:34,310
Blood, you're a dunce
if you kill someone for them fools.

495
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:36,705
Next man would do it twice
for that kind of Ps.

496
00:38:36,805 --> 00:38:38,748
Get off me, man.
I don't even care!

497
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:42,790
I'm up for a little arms and robbing, man.
But you gone psycho, blood.

498
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:45,786
You shot man last night and now this.
I'm not going jail for you.

499
00:38:45,886 --> 00:38:49,627
I'm not going jail for no one to call me
Abigail, call me some next man's chick.

500
00:38:49,727 --> 00:38:52,220
Burn that, man.
You can go, man. Fuck you.

501
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,908
- Who the fuck are you talking to, blood?
- Get off me, cuz, yeah?

502
00:38:56,008 --> 00:39:02,383
Calm down. What's wrong with you? I'm
supposed to be your friend. Calm down!

503
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,860
I'll catch up with you on Monday.

504
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:22,228
- Hey, baby.
- Hey, Mum.

505
00:39:22,328 --> 00:39:24,668
- How was school today?
- All right.

506
00:39:24,768 --> 00:39:31,568
Mummy's just got to see someone for a
bit, but then we're gonna go straight back.

507
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,519
OK, come on. Over here.

508
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,705
- You all right?
- What do you want?

509
00:39:41,805 --> 00:39:44,100
Can I give you a lift home?

510
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:58,135
- OK, I'm gonna be in in a minute, OK?
- OK.

511
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:05,586
- Where'd you get my number from?
- She left her phone when she fucked off.

512
00:40:05,686 --> 00:40:07,868
- So what you up to these days?
- Being a mum.

513
00:40:07,968 --> 00:40:09,968
Safe.

514
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:14,908
I'm just working in a salon, innit.
I wanna get into...

515
00:40:15,008 --> 00:40:17,827
What the fuck d'you want, Alex?

516
00:40:17,927 --> 00:40:19,390
It's Lexi.

517
00:40:19,490 --> 00:40:21,066
All right. Lexi.

518
00:40:21,166 --> 00:40:24,066
You bell me, say you want to
talk about something important,

519
00:40:24,166 --> 00:40:26,225
and now you're sitting having a chitchat?

520
00:40:26,325 --> 00:40:28,572
I don't mean to be rude,
but one of the last...

521
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:30,626
people I wanna have a social with is you.

522
00:40:30,726 --> 00:40:32,190
Fine. Whatever.

523
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:36,027
That guy Sam's out. Someone's after him.
He wants to know if you know anything.

524
00:40:36,127 --> 00:40:37,866
Well, I don't.

525
00:40:37,966 --> 00:40:40,228
Now tell me,
why the fuck should I even care?

526
00:40:40,328 --> 00:40:43,357
He deserves everything he gets.

527
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:51,229
Come on, Alisa. He's done his time,
he doesn't want any trouble.

528
00:40:51,329 --> 00:40:56,820
So? I don't give a fuck about him
and I don't even know why I met you.

529
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:59,507
Actually, do you know what, I do.

530
00:40:59,607 --> 00:41:03,986
I thought you were gonna tell me Becky
was hurt or homeless or something.

531
00:41:04,086 --> 00:41:07,385
I wanted to see if I felt sad.
And now you tell me she's missing.

532
00:41:07,485 --> 00:41:10,669
And do you know what?
I don't even fucking care.

533
00:41:10,769 --> 00:41:13,187
I don't care about her, you, or him.

534
00:41:13,287 --> 00:41:16,585
I don't even give a fuck either.
I just thought since he took time out

535
00:41:16,685 --> 00:41:19,040
to find me and... and to see Moony...

536
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:21,950
and Claire, that at
least I would pass on...

537
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:24,026
- He saw Moony and Claire?
- Yeah.

538
00:41:24,126 --> 00:41:26,670
He just said his piece and left.
What harm can it do?

539
00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:28,868
All right. Call him.

540
00:41:28,968 --> 00:41:34,663
But if he so much as raises his voice
to me, I'm calling the police.

541
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:46,170
You never came to see me.
Even when I was in hospital. Why?

542
00:41:46,235 --> 00:41:48,388
You...

543
00:41:48,488 --> 00:41:51,631
make me feel so shame.

544
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,920
I couldn't bear it.

545
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:59,905
More than one woman
lost their son that night.

546
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,909
- Lord God. What did I do wrong?
- You did nothing wrong.

547
00:42:05,009 --> 00:42:09,508
I try to raise you on my own. I work every
hour God send me to provide for you.

548
00:42:09,608 --> 00:42:14,305
- And what do I get? You, a murderer.
- It's different from murder.

549
00:42:14,405 --> 00:42:17,147
And your brother.

550
00:42:17,247 --> 00:42:20,052
He's gonna be worse than you are.

551
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:24,872
Maybe if I'd gone to church more.

552
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,826
I never meant to let you down, Mum.

553
00:42:28,926 --> 00:42:31,070
You never meant to.

554
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,640
But you did.

555
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,668
I borrowed your phone.

556
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:57,545
Whenever you're ready, pussy.

557
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,720
Yout.

558
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,513
Wha' gwan, blood?
What you got?

559
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:11,187
Bre! I ain't had them crisp in time,
you know! Let me have your crisp.

560
00:43:11,287 --> 00:43:13,628
- Tss!
- What? You say something?

561
00:43:13,728 --> 00:43:19,083
Did you say something, blood?
Give me the fucking chocolate too.

562
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:22,504
My man got 'nuff batteries.
What you need them for?

563
00:43:22,604 --> 00:43:25,427
- My shaver and...
- Nah, cuz! You don't need them.

564
00:43:25,527 --> 00:43:28,193
Give me your batteries.

565
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,949
- I'm not giving you the batteries.
- What? You a bad man now?

566
00:43:36,049 --> 00:43:39,947
You kill someone big? What was his
name? Tell me. See if I get shook of you.

567
00:43:40,047 --> 00:43:41,866
- His name was Trife.
- What?

568
00:43:41,966 --> 00:43:45,830
- His name was Trife.
- His name was Trife. Don't know him.

569
00:43:45,930 --> 00:43:50,350
And you know what?
I'm taking your fucking batteries.

570
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,960
You?

571
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:13,308
Hello?

572
00:44:13,408 --> 00:44:14,827
- That Sam?
- Yeah.

573
00:44:14,927 --> 00:44:17,225
- It's Lexi.
- Yeah, what's going on?

574
00:44:17,325 --> 00:44:20,509
- Alisa said she'll see you.
- Where?

575
00:44:20,609 --> 00:44:24,065
Go Latimer Station, do a left
through the alley then bell me.

576
00:44:24,165 --> 00:44:26,165
Safe.

577
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,747
What you doing, blood?
That's my chair.

578
00:44:35,847 --> 00:44:37,666
- I'm next.
- Did I say that's my chair?

579
00:44:37,766 --> 00:44:40,470
- I'm next.
- Shut the fuck up! I heard you first time.

580
00:44:40,570 --> 00:44:43,190
Oi! Oi, oi, oi, oi, oi!

581
00:44:43,290 --> 00:44:46,346
Come out the fucking shop.
You trying to fuck a man's business?

582
00:44:46,446 --> 00:44:49,336
I'm coming back for him, you know.

583
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,308
Yo, Omen.

584
00:44:53,408 --> 00:44:55,066
Wha' gwan, man?

585
00:44:55,166 --> 00:44:59,161
What's going on, man?
What happened to your lip?

586
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,588
You know I'd do anything for you.
We like blood.

587
00:45:02,688 --> 00:45:05,310
Yeah, yeah, man. Course.
Tell me, man.

588
00:45:05,410 --> 00:45:08,386
Ike and Andre asked me to get you man
and kill some bre for six Gs.

589
00:45:08,486 --> 00:45:10,625
- What? What for?
- I dunno.

590
00:45:10,725 --> 00:45:12,785
Me and Henry said,
"Nah, we ain't on it,"

591
00:45:12,885 --> 00:45:17,309
then we saw the bre and thought, "Fuck it.
May as well rush him." He bricked Henry.

592
00:45:17,409 --> 00:45:20,429
I tried to fight my man but he got away.

593
00:45:20,529 --> 00:45:24,390
- So where's Henry? Hospital?
- I had to kick out before the feds came.

594
00:45:24,490 --> 00:45:26,944
- You left Henry, blood?
- He was out cold.

595
00:45:27,044 --> 00:45:29,909
I chased the bre, called an ambulance,
got Blammy, came here.

596
00:45:30,009 --> 00:45:32,562
I was banging my yat. When Dabs called,

597
00:45:32,662 --> 00:45:35,749
I just left her - legs
up, gash out, everyting.

598
00:45:35,849 --> 00:45:38,229
Let me call Henry, man.

599
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,747
Fuck this. Who's the bre?
I'll fucking do it. He's dead.

600
00:45:47,847 --> 00:45:51,907
Dunno. But I'll recognise him, though.
I'll fucking recognise him.

601
00:45:52,007 --> 00:45:55,987
- They said it's big tings for us, blood.
- You know what? Fuck their tings!

602
00:45:56,087 --> 00:45:58,428
If this bre hurt Henry,
he's fucking done.

603
00:45:58,528 --> 00:46:02,700
It's done. That's what I said.
Well, you on it or what?

604
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:06,236
You done know. Come.

605
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:11,586
Oi, Moons.
I swear I'm leave, like.

606
00:47:11,686 --> 00:47:14,187
I just thought I seen my man
walking like he's big.

607
00:47:14,287 --> 00:47:17,347
Nah. Nah, I'm coming to get you now.

608
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,467
- What did she say, like?
- Alisa?

609
00:47:31,567 --> 00:47:35,547
Nothing. She just said bring him
and I said I'd sort it.

610
00:47:35,647 --> 00:47:37,949
Why are you helping me?

611
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,907
- I saw Jay.
- What? When? What did he say?

612
00:47:43,007 --> 00:47:48,702
Nothing. Well, I thought it was him -
he was on the train, I wasn't.

613
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:53,066
You all right?

614
00:47:53,166 --> 00:47:55,515
- Is her kid here?
- Yeah.

615
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,950
- What do you want? Find God in jail?
- I understand how much you hate me...

616
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:07,308
You'll never understand
how much I hate you.

617
00:48:07,408 --> 00:48:09,975
I didn't plan this. I
didn't know what I was...

618
00:48:10,075 --> 00:48:12,308
gonna do today, I just wanted to get out.

619
00:48:12,408 --> 00:48:15,668
But this guy attacked me and he's saying
people are gonna hurt my family.

620
00:48:15,768 --> 00:48:19,544
I wanna tell you that if you know who's
involved, I don't want any more trouble.

621
00:48:19,644 --> 00:48:22,626
- So this is about what you want?
- Come on, the guy's trying...

622
00:48:22,726 --> 00:48:25,509
Shut up, Alex.

623
00:48:25,609 --> 00:48:28,839
What about all the people you've hurt?

624
00:48:28,933 --> 00:48:32,268
What about what they want?
What about all the lives you've ruined?

625
00:48:32,368 --> 00:48:36,533
- I didn't mean to kill him.
- You didn't mean it?

626
00:48:36,617 --> 00:48:38,617
Wait here.

627
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:46,330
It's not going the way you planned, is it?

628
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:50,760
What? !

629
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:53,869
Fucking prick!

630
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:05,950
OK. Go play with your toys,
sweetheart.

631
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:09,949
What about what she wants?

632
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:15,307
Like a dad? Which she doesn't have
because of you.

633
00:49:15,407 --> 00:49:21,910
You think... I have time to sit around
and organise how to get you back?

634
00:49:22,010 --> 00:49:24,070
D'you know what?

635
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,440
Mum?

636
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:42,947
Don't you ever... come near me
or my daughter again.

637
00:49:43,047 --> 00:49:45,047
You either.

638
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:01,227
What you doing now?

639
00:50:01,327 --> 00:50:02,667
I dunno.

640
00:50:02,767 --> 00:50:05,507
I know it sounds dumb,
but it was good seeing you today.

641
00:50:05,607 --> 00:50:08,948
It's good that you come out of jail,
and you're, like, all right.

642
00:50:09,048 --> 00:50:12,505
Bell me sometime, yeah,
if you're bored or whatever.

643
00:50:12,605 --> 00:50:17,545
Or if you're not doing nothing now, you
could just... go back to mine and just...

644
00:50:17,645 --> 00:50:19,509
just whatever...

645
00:50:19,609 --> 00:50:21,609
for a bit.

646
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:33,029
- Any of these bres?
- Nah, man.

647
00:50:33,129 --> 00:50:36,189
- You heard this?
- Put it away, man.

648
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:42,548
Fucking hell, man.

649
00:50:42,648 --> 00:50:48,027
Everywhere I go... Why the biggest guy
in the world always stand in front of me?

650
00:50:48,127 --> 00:50:50,584
Yo, blood!

651
00:50:50,684 --> 00:50:53,469
You get paid to follow me around
or something?

652
00:50:53,569 --> 00:50:55,668
What?
You wanna say something to me?

653
00:50:55,768 --> 00:50:59,188
You better chat slow, yeah, blood.
I don't speak Big Foot.

654
00:50:59,288 --> 00:51:04,580
- Hey, that's him. That's the fucking bre.
- Come we get him, then.

655
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:07,485
Fuck round him and knock him out.

656
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:11,965
Hey, man! Hey, pussyhole!

657
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:14,788
- Get the fuck up.
- Fuck up!

658
00:51:14,888 --> 00:51:17,510
Get the fuck up! Stand up!

659
00:51:17,610 --> 00:51:20,150
- I wanna see him.
- Fucking do it, man.

660
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:21,747
Fuck!

661
00:51:21,847 --> 00:51:24,145
- That's not him, man.
- What?

662
00:51:24,245 --> 00:51:26,508
It's not fucking him.

663
00:51:26,608 --> 00:51:28,586
- Fuck!
- Might as well jack him.

664
00:51:28,686 --> 00:51:30,150
- Fucking come here.
- Come on!

665
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:32,066
Shut up!

666
00:51:32,166 --> 00:51:34,631
Shut up. What? Shut up. Sing.

667
00:51:34,688 --> 00:51:36,785
- You deaf, pussyhole?
- Fucking sing.

668
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:41,475
- # Let me go
- Fucking dickhead. Get out of here, man.

669
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:43,866
I thought you knew
what the bre looks like.

670
00:51:43,966 --> 00:51:47,999
I do, man.
I just made a mistake, innit.

671
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,389
It's Henry.

672
00:51:53,489 --> 00:51:55,489
Hello?

673
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:05,308
What, blood?

674
00:52:05,408 --> 00:52:08,110
That was his mum.

675
00:52:08,210 --> 00:52:12,629
- He's not dead, he's just unconscious.
- So are we still gonna do this, or what?

676
00:52:12,729 --> 00:52:14,729
Yeah, come.

677
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:30,835
Come in. We can have a fat spliff,
just cotch for a bit.

678
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:37,785
It's small. Hope it don't
remind you of jail too much.

679
00:52:37,885 --> 00:52:40,228
- You want a drink?
- Yeah. What you got?

680
00:52:40,328 --> 00:52:42,784
Um... water.

681
00:52:42,884 --> 00:52:46,454
M-might have some Um Bongo
in the cupboard.

682
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:57,280
What's that?

683
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:01,865
Exzoryapan. It's, like, a...

684
00:53:01,965 --> 00:53:04,105
It's an antidepressant... thing.

685
00:53:04,205 --> 00:53:06,205
I get...

686
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:21,405
So what you doing tomorrow, like?

687
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:26,905
Why? That your way
of asking me to do something?

688
00:53:27,005 --> 00:53:30,428
No, man. I was just...
No. I was just asking.

689
00:53:30,528 --> 00:53:33,267
I never do nothing no more.

690
00:53:33,367 --> 00:53:36,027
Get up, go to work, come home.

691
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:38,627
I spent six and half years
wishing I could do something

692
00:53:38,727 --> 00:53:40,828
and you don't know
what you're doing tomorrow.

693
00:53:40,928 --> 00:53:42,985
So what you doing?

694
00:53:43,085 --> 00:53:47,260
- Something, man. Anything.
- Exactly. You don't know.

695
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:50,149
Well, what do you like doing?

696
00:53:50,249 --> 00:53:52,544
I draw designs sometimes...

697
00:53:52,626 --> 00:53:55,261
It doesn't matter. It's stupid.

698
00:53:55,560 --> 00:54:02,020
You know what? You're the first bre
that asked me what I like to do in years.

699
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:10,307
- So where exactly is Becky, then?
- I don't know. She just up and left.

700
00:54:10,407 --> 00:54:14,184
Got home four weeks ago - gone.
I ain't seen or heard from her since.

701
00:54:14,284 --> 00:54:18,109
- You don't seem that bothered.
- No, I'm not.

702
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:22,345
- I've missed this, man.
- What?

703
00:54:22,445 --> 00:54:28,300
Just cotching at a girl's yard, like. Just
little things, like going cinema and that.

704
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,066
- Shit... Oh, sorry.
- Oh, fuck!

705
00:54:30,166 --> 00:54:32,549
Nah, it's all right.

706
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:43,040
Come here.

707
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:45,160
Come here.

708
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:54,028
Oi, Moons!

709
00:54:54,128 --> 00:54:57,505
- What you saying, fam? You cool?
- No, I'm not cool. I'm vexed.

710
00:54:57,605 --> 00:55:00,985
I thought I see him on the train, innit?
I swear I'm going mad, blood.

711
00:55:01,085 --> 00:55:04,348
I wanted to spark him,
then I thought, "Let me calm down."

712
00:55:04,448 --> 00:55:08,549
Let me come get you and let's do this
together, blood, like it should be done.

713
00:55:08,649 --> 00:55:11,147
I got some little youts
looking for him as well.

714
00:55:11,247 --> 00:55:14,668
- Which way we going, man? It's that way.
- Relax. Come in for a chat.

715
00:55:14,768 --> 00:55:19,528
We ain't got time for no chat!
We need to go get him now.

716
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:22,346
- Hey!
- Shut up, you waste man!

717
00:55:22,446 --> 00:55:24,505
You're all butters anyway!

718
00:55:24,605 --> 00:55:26,186
Bitch!

719
00:55:26,286 --> 00:55:28,555
Relax, Jay, man.

720
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:32,948
Hey, blood.
What you wearing, man?

721
00:55:33,048 --> 00:55:39,593
You look like a fucking batty man, blood.
This better be for some uni project.

722
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:48,791
Jay... this is my girl Kayla.

723
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,795
Rah, blood!

724
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:58,987
So I don't see you in a couple of months,
yeah, and you got yourself a girl, blood?

725
00:55:59,087 --> 00:56:01,461
Babe, check they didn't
put no onions in it.

726
00:56:01,561 --> 00:56:02,668
You know how you get.

727
00:56:02,768 --> 00:56:05,629
- Are we gonna go get him or what?
- What exactly is going on?

728
00:56:05,729 --> 00:56:09,829
- Robert ain't really filled me in.
- "Robert"?

729
00:56:09,929 --> 00:56:11,868
All right. Basically, yeah.

730
00:56:11,968 --> 00:56:15,873
This guy...
that killed our best friend...

731
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:18,548
just come out of jail, innit?

732
00:56:18,648 --> 00:56:21,387
- And I want us to go get him back.
- And do what?

733
00:56:21,487 --> 00:56:23,944
Blood, what's this girl on?
What you think?

734
00:56:24,044 --> 00:56:26,627
- I'm not on it, bruv.
- What you talking about?

735
00:56:26,727 --> 00:56:29,669
- I'm talking about Sam.
- He said he's not interested.

736
00:56:29,769 --> 00:56:33,065
You speak for him now? Go suck out.
Who's talking to you anyway?

737
00:56:33,165 --> 00:56:37,067
I don't know who you think you're talking
to, but you don't speak to me like that.

738
00:56:37,167 --> 00:56:40,705
- Seckle yourself. Moony, tell your girl.
- Tell me what?

739
00:56:40,805 --> 00:56:44,308
Listen, this ain't a dictatorship, "blood",
this is a relationship.

740
00:56:44,408 --> 00:56:47,030
I'm a 22-year-old woman
who's studying law.

741
00:56:47,130 --> 00:56:50,468
He does not tell me nothing.
We discuss things together, yeah.

742
00:56:50,568 --> 00:56:55,820
Maybe if you was a man instead of a yout
in a man's body you would know that.

743
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:58,065
Hey, blood, I will spark your girl...

744
00:56:58,165 --> 00:57:00,385
- Jay, don't chat...
- Don't speak for me.

745
00:57:00,485 --> 00:57:04,706
Listen. On Earth, where I'm from, men are
supposed to treat women with respect.

746
00:57:04,806 --> 00:57:08,867
If you ain't gonna chat to me with respect,
have your conversation away from me.

747
00:57:08,967 --> 00:57:10,967
Move!

748
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,986
- What you looking at?
- You!

749
00:57:16,086 --> 00:57:18,667
- Don't look at me, man.
- Come on, man! Just jam, man.

750
00:57:18,767 --> 00:57:21,399
Jay, what's your problem, man?

751
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:02,150
- Fuck... Get off me!
- What the fuck is wrong with you?

752
00:58:02,250 --> 00:58:03,483
- You know what? Fuck this.

753
00:58:03,583 --> 00:58:05,625
Wait, wait. I will, I
swear. Please. Fuck...

754
00:58:05,725 --> 00:58:08,275
Just... Sam, give me a minute.

755
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,958
You all right, like?

756
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:23,264
Yeah. I'm fine.

757
00:58:23,364 --> 00:58:28,100
So what you act like tings
is gonna run for then back out?

758
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:30,200
It's just...

759
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:34,107
It's been a while. You get me?

760
00:58:34,207 --> 00:58:35,786
It has!

761
00:58:35,886 --> 00:58:41,751
Why you let it get so far, then?
It's been time for me as well, innit?

762
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:46,720
It's weird.

763
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:53,270
When I was, like, 15,
all I wanted to do was get older.

764
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:59,310
And now I am.
I can do anything I want.

765
00:58:59,390 --> 00:59:01,505
I can drink...

766
00:59:01,605 --> 00:59:03,905
vote...

767
00:59:04,005 --> 00:59:06,673
fuck... drive...

768
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:10,989
I'm legally an adult.

769
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:16,706
But I've realised two things.

770
00:59:16,806 --> 00:59:18,806
One...

771
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:23,745
I would do anything
to go get them years back.

772
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:28,040
Two...

773
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:31,029
I never felt more alone.

774
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:37,880
I've never felt more like a kid
in my whole life.

775
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:43,190
D'you get me?

776
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:46,548
Yeah.

777
00:59:46,648 --> 00:59:51,026
How you let her chat to me like that, man?
What? Are you some kind of pussy?

778
00:59:51,126 --> 00:59:52,706
- The only pussy is you.
- Fucking...

779
00:59:52,806 --> 00:59:56,461
- Relax, Jay, man.
- I'll take you on, bruv.

780
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:02,105
Listen, Jay, I don't think
this is a good idea, you know.

781
01:00:02,205 --> 01:00:03,989
Come on, blood.

782
01:00:04,089 --> 01:00:07,864
Have you forgotten what my man did?
What he took from us, blood?

783
01:00:07,964 --> 01:00:11,555
He killed Trife! He took everything!

784
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:16,587
- What happened to your arm?
- Nothing.

785
01:00:16,687 --> 01:00:21,305
- Why you fight them girls earlier?
- It was something about one of their men.

786
01:00:21,405 --> 01:00:24,865
It was nothing to do with me,
it was to do with Becky, but...

787
01:00:24,965 --> 01:00:31,085
when you hang around with a girl
that's notorious for fucking everyone...

788
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:34,107
That's why you're here, innit?

789
01:00:34,207 --> 01:00:37,309
Cos you thought,
"I'm gonna fuck the white girl."

790
01:00:37,409 --> 01:00:39,508
"And she'll be easy too,
like her cousin."

791
01:00:39,608 --> 01:00:43,949
He made our lives hell, blood!
For fucking years!

792
01:00:44,049 --> 01:00:47,745
Then he came to that party, blood,
with a bat, and he killed our boy!

793
01:00:47,845 --> 01:00:51,225
If you'd have jumped in,
it wouldn't have happened, would it?

794
01:00:51,325 --> 01:00:53,146
So you have to help me!

795
01:00:53,246 --> 01:00:57,786
And yeah, you know what, I had a few
when I was younger, but so what?

796
01:00:57,886 --> 01:01:03,070
Trouble is, once everyone's fucked you,
your bargaining tools is used up.

797
01:01:03,170 --> 01:01:05,188
You ain't got nothing left to offer.

798
01:01:05,288 --> 01:01:07,830
Cos if you'd done something
when you had the chance,

799
01:01:07,930 --> 01:01:11,245
Trife would have still been here today!

800
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:14,707
- Come we kick, fam.
- Robert!

801
01:01:14,807 --> 01:01:17,155
Yeah, come we go, blood.

802
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:21,250
You know what?
I ain't got nothing.

803
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:25,350
I got no man.

804
01:01:25,450 --> 01:01:29,267
No mates.
I got no loyalties to no one.

805
01:01:29,367 --> 01:01:31,492
No one's got none for me.

806
01:01:31,580 --> 01:01:35,228
- Lock that girl off, man!
- D'you know where he is, fam?

807
01:01:35,328 --> 01:01:38,133
Yeah. I know exactly where he is.

808
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:41,107
So what happened to you?

809
01:01:41,207 --> 01:01:45,117
What? Why does something
have to have happened?

810
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:53,335
It takes something fucked-up to happen to
us for us to realise how big we fucked up.

811
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:56,640
All right.

812
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:58,907
Fine.

813
01:01:59,007 --> 01:02:01,560
You wanna know? Cool.

814
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:06,235
A year and a half ago.

815
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:09,787
Seven men.

816
01:02:09,887 --> 01:02:11,887
Three hours.

817
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:16,436
They took turns.

818
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:20,440
Three hours.

819
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:24,829
They fucking put things in me.

820
01:02:24,929 --> 01:02:27,275
They raped me.

821
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:30,429
And they got away with it.

822
01:02:30,529 --> 01:02:34,269
Cos we'd gone there,
to the gym, after hours,

823
01:02:34,347 --> 01:02:36,784
to meet this instructor and his mate.

824
01:02:36,884 --> 01:02:39,829
She didn't tell me
there was gonna be seven mates.

825
01:02:39,929 --> 01:02:43,907
She went off with her one,
left me with the rest.

826
01:02:44,007 --> 01:02:51,062
My dad had to sit in court and hear all the
shit they managed to dredge up about me.

827
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:53,270
They had money.

828
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:56,535
Said I was a fucking whore.

829
01:02:56,960 --> 01:03:00,650
I never sold myself,
but cos I was with her,

830
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:02,750
they never believed me.

831
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:10,507
We didn't speak after it happened,
lived here for ages just not talking.

832
01:03:10,607 --> 01:03:13,347
When she was here, that is.

833
01:03:13,447 --> 01:03:15,749
I had nowhere else to go.

834
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:24,070
That's why I don't give a fuck
where she is, or if she ever comes back.

835
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:26,916
No one deserves that.

836
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:35,920
- Who you keep texting?
- No one.

837
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:41,740
- Who you fucking texting?
- No one. What the fuck are you doing?

838
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:43,840
Sorry.

839
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:47,985
What's all that on your back?

840
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:50,360
Oh, fuck...

841
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:54,840
What you want, man?

842
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:58,516
What do I want?

843
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:04,667
Do you believe in karma?

844
01:04:04,767 --> 01:04:05,745
Hm?

845
01:04:05,845 --> 01:04:09,949
Trife, the yout you killed...
was my nephew.

846
01:04:10,049 --> 01:04:12,049
Aaargh!

847
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:14,640
Shut up.

848
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:19,946
Make one more fucking noise and I will
kill you even slower than I planned to.

849
01:04:20,046 --> 01:04:22,873
You pussy!

850
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:27,914
- Hey!
- Noooo!

851
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:36,110
- Don't fucking touch me!
- Sorry. Sorry. Fuck.

852
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:39,065
- Sam, it's locked.
- Open the fucking door.

853
01:04:39,165 --> 01:04:41,827
- Open the fucking door!
- All right. Listen.

854
01:04:41,927 --> 01:04:46,668
I know. You try and block it out and
you can't, so you shut everyone else out.

855
01:04:46,768 --> 01:04:47,689
- Fuck you, man!

856
01:04:47,789 --> 01:04:50,348
I'll tell you what I get told all the time.

857
01:04:50,448 --> 01:04:52,904
What you just told me. Sam.

858
01:04:53,004 --> 01:04:56,705
Whatever happened to you,
whatever it was, you didn't deserve it.

859
01:04:56,805 --> 01:04:59,749
You did fucking deserve it,
you fucking sket!

860
01:04:59,849 --> 01:05:03,334
Don't you ever fucking say that about me!

861
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:11,500
Come we fuck him up, man.

862
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:12,787
See, I knew you'd be on it, blood.

863
01:05:12,887 --> 01:05:16,707
We're gonna finish this tonight. Show him
he should never've fucked with us.

864
01:05:16,807 --> 01:05:21,149
Leave that girl as well. Come roll together
again. Jay and Moony running tings...

865
01:05:21,249 --> 01:05:23,226
- My name's Robert.
- All right.

866
01:05:23,326 --> 01:05:25,827
Robert, then, innit?
Bob and Jay running tings.

867
01:05:25,927 --> 01:05:32,132
Prove to people you ain't a pussy no
more. Show Sam we're better than him.

868
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:38,385
- I can't do this, blood.
- You're gonna back out of this now?

869
01:05:38,485 --> 01:05:41,466
- Why you a pussy? We gotta show him...
- I am showing him!

870
01:05:41,566 --> 01:05:45,706
By what? By being a pussy and letting him
get away with it? By studying your shit?

871
01:05:45,806 --> 01:05:50,308
Yeah! I'm not doing this. I don't want
nothing to do with this. What'll it prove?

872
01:05:50,408 --> 01:05:53,147
Well, fuck you then, innit.

873
01:05:53,247 --> 01:05:54,747
Fucking prick!

874
01:05:54,847 --> 01:05:58,790
That's what it's about now, yeah? You're
gonna forget about a man over a girl.

875
01:05:58,890 --> 01:06:00,387
You fucking pussy.

876
01:06:00,487 --> 01:06:04,025
That's what you are, what you've
always been. A fucking pussyhole.

877
01:06:04,125 --> 01:06:07,585
What? You think you're
a big man now? What?

878
01:06:07,685 --> 01:06:10,274
Maybe I'm the smart one, yeah?

879
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:17,199
He killed Trife, blood!

880
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:41,187
Hey, you, man.

881
01:06:41,287 --> 01:06:43,287
That's him.

882
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:45,800
That's him. Come.

883
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:08,190
Do this shit!

884
01:07:08,290 --> 01:07:12,700
- Turn him over.
- What the fuck for, man? He hurt Henry.

885
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:15,945
Give me the fucking blade.
I'll do it.

886
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:20,547
Now turn the pussyhole over.
I want him to see me.

887
01:07:20,647 --> 01:07:24,217
- So he knows who he fucked with.
- Shit...

888
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:30,680
Sam?

889
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,065
- What's going on?
- What you doing?

890
01:07:35,165 --> 01:07:37,907
That's my brother, blood.
You man mad?

891
01:07:38,007 --> 01:07:40,753
Who knew who we was looking for?

892
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:44,746
- You knew.
- What you talking about?

893
01:07:44,846 --> 01:07:47,746
You knew. That's why you
didn't want to let me look at him.

894
01:07:47,846 --> 01:07:51,071
I didn't know nothing about this.

895
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:55,066
All right, look...
Ike and Andre and them man.

896
01:07:55,166 --> 01:07:59,626
They had some next bre there, offering
bare Ps, blood. We'll split it, me and you.

897
01:07:59,726 --> 01:08:02,988
- But that's my brother.
- Fuck him! You don't even like him.

898
01:08:03,088 --> 01:08:05,507
You always gunning him,
telling me you hate him.

899
01:08:05,607 --> 01:08:07,788
Fucker's been in jail since you was ten.

900
01:08:07,888 --> 01:08:11,505
- You didn't even know he came out today.
- It's still my brother, blood.

901
01:08:11,605 --> 01:08:16,025
So what happened to Henry?
Did my brother hurt Henry?

902
01:08:16,123 --> 01:08:19,548
- What can I say, man, he weren't on it.
- You done him.

903
01:08:19,648 --> 01:08:21,509
You fucking pussyhole.

904
01:08:21,609 --> 01:08:23,745
If not for this prick,
I wouldn't have had to.

905
01:08:23,845 --> 01:08:26,304
- You're wrong, Dabs.
- No, you're wrong.

906
01:08:26,404 --> 01:08:29,785
Yous are all fucking wrong.
Wrong in your fucking brains!

907
01:08:29,885 --> 01:08:33,910
- I'm talking about six Gs here.
- Who gave you the money, blood?

908
01:08:34,010 --> 01:08:36,010
Tss!

909
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:40,387
Sam, shall I bore this bre?
No one's around, man.

910
01:08:40,487 --> 01:08:43,865
Come I just jook him and we dust, man.
Just like he was gonna do to you.

911
01:08:43,965 --> 01:08:46,749
- Don't be silly...
- Shut your fucking mouth.

912
01:08:46,849 --> 01:08:49,906
Shall I do it, blood?
Just tell me, Sam.

913
01:08:50,006 --> 01:08:52,275
Just say the word.

914
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:21,595
Nah, man.

915
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:34,038
What a punch, blood!
Seriously, man...

916
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:37,040
Thung!

917
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:40,880
You all right, bruv?

918
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:44,789
Yeah, man. Come we kick.

919
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:49,145
Whoa!

920
01:09:49,245 --> 01:09:53,589
Oyster card too, man.
I'll go check your girl tonight, man.

921
01:09:53,689 --> 01:09:57,769
Safe, blood.
You dickhead, man. Fucking dickhead.

922
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:13,345
- Where is he?
- He's left. He won't be far.

923
01:10:13,445 --> 01:10:15,069
I told you to keep him.

924
01:10:15,169 --> 01:10:17,870
- Have you got the gear?
- Why should I give you anything?

925
01:10:17,970 --> 01:10:22,426
Come on, Jay. Please. Come on. You
took too long. I tried to keep him here.

926
01:10:22,526 --> 01:10:25,629
Jay, please. Please.
Just give me a little bit, all right?

927
01:10:25,729 --> 01:10:28,430
- Remember when we let you stay here...
- Where's he gone?

928
01:10:28,530 --> 01:10:32,347
- He doesn't want any trouble, Jay...
- Where's he gone? !

929
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:34,556
I don't know.

930
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:37,520
Come on, Lex.

931
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:43,295
What've I gotta do
to get information from you, huh?

932
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:48,152
- Bring my boys round?
- Fuck you.

933
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:53,874
Take your fucking drugs.

934
01:11:01,480 --> 01:11:02,302
- What the fuck...

935
01:11:02,402 --> 01:11:04,386
It was me. What the fuck is all this shit?

936
01:11:04,486 --> 01:11:07,785
- You can't tell me nothing.
- I'm not trying to tell you nothing...

937
01:11:07,885 --> 01:11:10,387
You know what,
just give me your heater.

938
01:11:10,487 --> 01:11:13,717
I know you got one.
Just give it to me.

939
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:25,305
We got to make the best
out of bad situations.

940
01:11:25,405 --> 01:11:28,147
I get treated certain ways
everywhere we go,

941
01:11:28,247 --> 01:11:30,704
even when I'm not doing nothing,
mans watching me.

942
01:11:30,804 --> 01:11:33,946
Judging me.
For something you done.

943
01:11:34,046 --> 01:11:38,806
Right, that... that's making the best
of a bad situation.

944
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:42,525
There's nothing for man to do round here.

945
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:46,507
You know what I learnt when I went
big man jail, blood? Fuck all.

946
01:11:46,607 --> 01:11:49,389
I packed them little breakfast trays,
did a bit of laundry.

947
01:11:49,489 --> 01:11:52,067
I never learnt how to not go back in.
You get on that path...

948
01:11:52,167 --> 01:11:55,146
I'm not stupid like you, though, Sam!

949
01:11:55,246 --> 01:11:58,908
- If I do something I'm not getting caught.
- It's not about getting caught.

950
01:11:59,008 --> 01:12:06,063
It's about spending your days looking over
your shoulder. I don't want that for you.

951
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:12,908
- Where's this Ike bre's place?
- 40 Compromise Avenue.

952
01:12:13,008 --> 01:12:15,225
It's a basement flat, innit.

953
01:12:15,325 --> 01:12:16,790
- I'm coming.
- Stay here.

954
01:12:16,890 --> 01:12:19,430
- I'm coming...
- I said stay here!

955
01:12:19,530 --> 01:12:21,795
I want you to stay here.

956
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:25,916
Look, man.
Just do me one favour.

957
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:31,585
Stay here and look after Mum. The bre
that's after me I think might come here.

958
01:12:31,685 --> 01:12:36,465
If you love her, if you ever loved me,
just stay here tonight.

959
01:12:36,565 --> 01:12:38,386
OK?

960
01:12:38,486 --> 01:12:40,486
OK.

961
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:45,265
You fuck with them, they'll kill you.

962
01:12:45,365 --> 01:12:48,085
Badder men than them have tried.

963
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:11,840
I love you, Mum.

964
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:15,150
Royston does too.

965
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:06,627
- Take your hands out your pockets.
- What the fuck you want?

966
01:15:06,727 --> 01:15:10,637
- Just do what I asked you, please, sir.
- Sam?

967
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:14,468
- It's Desmond.
- Buds?

968
01:15:14,568 --> 01:15:16,546
- Buds?
- It's what they used to call me.

969
01:15:16,646 --> 01:15:19,988
It's all right. I know him.
Have a little walk, let me chat to him.

970
01:15:20,088 --> 01:15:22,088
Yeah, walk on, man.

971
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:27,585
What's going on, blood?
When you come out?

972
01:15:27,685 --> 01:15:30,310
Come out today, blood.

973
01:15:30,410 --> 01:15:31,827
Policeman?

974
01:15:31,927 --> 01:15:34,630
Community support, bruv.
I can't arrest no one.

975
01:15:34,730 --> 01:15:36,870
I'm on 22 grand, bruv.

976
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:43,785
Look, I'm... I'm sorry I never come check
you inside, man. You know what it's like.

977
01:15:43,885 --> 01:15:45,885
Yeah.

978
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:51,425
Listen, man, I... I better dust
before my man gets annoyed, yeah?

979
01:15:51,525 --> 01:15:55,225
Listen, man, how long armed-response
unit take to come round here?

980
01:15:55,325 --> 01:15:58,865
There was a shooting here yesterday,
so there's a couple of cars around.

981
01:15:58,965 --> 01:16:01,467
- Say about 15 minutes.
- Safe, man.

982
01:16:01,567 --> 01:16:06,327
- Why? What's going on?
- Nothing, man. I'm just curious.

983
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:09,948
You sure?

984
01:16:10,048 --> 01:16:11,227
Yeah.

985
01:16:11,327 --> 01:16:13,622
Stay out of trouble, blood.

986
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:18,425
It's OK.

987
01:16:18,525 --> 01:16:21,389
Desmond, or Buds,
or whatever you wanna call yourself,

988
01:16:21,489 --> 01:16:26,674
I'm not gonna be made to look a fool
in front of these people.

989
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:37,588
Yeah.

990
01:16:37,688 --> 01:16:39,688
Hello, Big?

991
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:43,540
It's Sam. I wanna ask you for that favour.

992
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:47,424
No, I ain't got it, but...
it won't take me long to get it.

993
01:16:47,524 --> 01:16:49,229
Filo.

994
01:16:49,329 --> 01:16:50,305
Yep.

995
01:16:50,405 --> 01:16:52,386
How you gonna get him there?

996
01:16:52,486 --> 01:16:55,227
I know how to get him there.

997
01:16:55,327 --> 01:16:59,108
All right, man, it's... your funeral.

998
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:15,585
15 minutes.

999
01:17:15,685 --> 01:17:19,028
I've got a proposition for you.
Call it a peace offering.

1000
01:17:19,128 --> 01:17:23,346
But if I give this to you...
me and you, our problems are done.

1001
01:17:23,446 --> 01:17:25,788
When you get there, ask for Big Man.

1002
01:17:25,888 --> 01:17:31,923
Give me your bag! Give me the bag, man.
I'm sorry. Just give me the bag.

1003
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:40,348
Hello, police? I've just been robbed
by a man with a gun.

1004
01:17:40,448 --> 01:17:46,143
He's going into number 40, Compromise
Avenue. I need help right now.

1005
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:56,267
You're not one of our regular boys.

1006
01:17:56,367 --> 01:17:58,628
You must be the geezer
Omen said was coming.

1007
01:17:58,728 --> 01:18:00,828
Yeah, yeah.
My name's Big Man.

1008
01:18:00,928 --> 01:18:03,108
I'm here to check Ike and Andre.

1009
01:18:03,208 --> 01:18:05,208
About what?

1010
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:12,509
Nice.

1011
01:18:12,609 --> 01:18:14,609
OK.

1012
01:18:14,679 --> 01:18:20,119
- Get the fuck over here!
- What the fuck is wrong with you, man?

1013
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:25,036
You got the time, blood?

1014
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:28,745
You in a rush, blood?

1015
01:18:28,845 --> 01:18:31,347
Nah, man. I'm just asking.

1016
01:18:31,447 --> 01:18:33,447
All right, come.

1017
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:40,360
Wait there, yeah?

1018
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:58,149
What you saying, blood?

1019
01:18:59,720 --> 01:19:02,950
- So you're Big Man, yeah?
- Yeah, man.

1020
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:05,749
So what you want from us?

1021
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:10,506
Talk then, man.

1022
01:19:10,606 --> 01:19:12,469
Me and my business partner heard of you.

1023
01:19:12,569 --> 01:19:15,908
We thought it might be beneficial
for all of us if we come work with you.

1024
01:19:16,008 --> 01:19:19,408
- So where's your partner?
- He's coming.

1025
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:27,906
Why do you keep looking at the clock,
blood? There somewhere you need to be?

1026
01:19:28,006 --> 01:19:30,028
- Nah, I'm just...
- Come on, then. Tell us.

1027
01:19:30,128 --> 01:19:36,163
Yeah. You tell us what you can do for us
that we can't do for ourselves.

1028
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:39,666
Didn't Omen and Dabs tell you?
You need to speak to them...

1029
01:19:39,766 --> 01:19:44,781
Really? And honestly,
I don't never see us working together.

1030
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:51,380
Think I'd have a fucking monkey like you
on my level?

1031
01:19:52,840 --> 01:19:58,535
Don't look to me for support,
you know, blood. His sister's my girl.

1032
01:20:01,320 --> 01:20:06,930
And you know what? I don't really
work with man like you, you know.

1033
01:20:17,320 --> 01:20:20,380
See what Dabs has to say about this.

1034
01:20:26,240 --> 01:20:28,960
- Who are you?
- Where's Big Man?

1035
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:34,810
Nah. It's answering machine.
Listen, I don't give a fuck...

1036
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:37,744
What the fuck do you want, man?
I haven't done...

1037
01:20:37,844 --> 01:20:40,709
Shut your fucking mouth.
Put your hands on the table.

1038
01:20:40,809 --> 01:20:44,185
Put your hands on the table.

1039
01:20:44,285 --> 01:20:48,868
Now, you're gonna keep quiet.
And you're gonna stay in here.

1040
01:20:48,968 --> 01:20:54,578
Or man is gonna go on different with you,
you understand me, blood?

1041
01:21:12,440 --> 01:21:14,220
Fuck!

1042
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:16,700
What the fuck is going on? !

1043
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:22,345
Back up! You stay there.
You stay on the fucking floor!

1044
01:21:22,445 --> 01:21:24,665
- You set me up.
- I didn't, Curtis, I swear.

1045
01:21:24,765 --> 01:21:27,549
What the fuck is going?
All of you, shut the fuck up.

1046
01:21:27,649 --> 01:21:29,649
- You!
- Nah, man.

1047
01:21:29,719 --> 01:21:32,069
You. You.

1048
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:37,375
Never fuck with a guy
who ain't got nothing to lose.

1049
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:43,860
And you two, you were gonna send
my own brother to come try kill me?

1050
01:21:43,960 --> 01:21:45,960
Are you dizzy, blood?

1051
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:51,285
- All of you is fucking dead, man.
- Yeah?

1052
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:54,180
Blood, can dead men do this?

1053
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:03,634
Open it! Police!

1054
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:11,800
Fuck!

1055
01:22:17,720 --> 01:22:19,720
Down! Get down!

1056
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:29,149
Fuck.

1057
01:22:29,249 --> 01:22:33,358
Hi. Sam... Um, you said
you had your mum's phone.

1058
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:36,264
Take him.

1059
01:22:36,364 --> 01:22:38,364
I got problems.

1060
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:41,880
But I'm sorting 'em.

1061
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:44,945
Open this!

1062
01:22:45,045 --> 01:22:48,700
Listen, Jay's after you,
so just be careful.

1063
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:52,948
Um...

1064
01:22:53,048 --> 01:22:55,989
I know you said you missed,
like, going cinema and that,

1065
01:22:56,089 --> 01:22:59,064
so I've booked a couple of tickets.

1066
01:23:02,720 --> 01:23:07,310
Thought we could just go tomorrow night,
just as mates?

1067
01:23:07,405 --> 01:23:09,405
Please.

1068
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:14,716
Call me when you get this.
If you want.

1069
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:18,160
Out! Police!

1070
01:23:24,280 --> 01:23:26,280
Police! Get down!

1071
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:28,025
You think I forgot you, blood?
Is that what you think?

1072
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:44,310
We don't need to do this, Jay.

1073
01:24:53,640 --> 01:24:55,466
I'll kill you, blood.

1074
01:24:55,566 --> 01:24:57,776
I'm gonna kill you, blood!

1075
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:25,285
You think that's faster than this, blood?

1076
01:25:26,640 --> 01:25:29,006
- Trife wouldn't want
this. That's what he...

1077
01:25:29,106 --> 01:25:30,345
Shut your fucking mouth!

1078
01:25:30,445 --> 01:25:32,908
Remember that night, blood?

1079
01:25:38,440 --> 01:25:41,905
- Yeah.
- And what? You think you're a big man?

1080
01:25:42,005 --> 01:25:44,747
No, man. Look, I...
I never wanted him to die, blood.

1081
01:25:44,847 --> 01:25:46,629
What?

1082
01:25:46,729 --> 01:25:49,534
You think this is just about him?

1083
01:25:49,601 --> 01:25:50,907
This is about me!

1084
01:25:51,007 --> 01:25:54,237
Why you think I'm here, huh?
Like this?

1085
01:25:54,292 --> 01:25:57,182
You did this.
You made this happen.

1086
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:00,470
I fucking hate you for it.

1087
01:26:00,570 --> 01:26:03,110
I'm here not just for you,

1088
01:26:03,210 --> 01:26:05,250
I'm here because of you!

1089
01:26:06,040 --> 01:26:09,266
- Then I beg you, let's stop.
- That's right, blood, beg!

1090
01:26:09,366 --> 01:26:12,187
I wanna hear you.
I wanna hear you beg like Trife did.

1091
01:26:12,287 --> 01:26:16,826
If that's what you want, blood.
I'm begging, man, don't do this. Please.

1092
01:26:16,926 --> 01:26:18,868
I'm still gonna kill you, blood.

1093
01:26:18,968 --> 01:26:23,069
I'm gonna take your fucking life,
like you took Trife's.

1094
01:26:23,169 --> 01:26:25,169
Like you took mine!

1095
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:29,265
Just fucking do it, man,
and get it over with.

1096
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:33,545
Six and a half years
and that's what you still want.

1097
01:26:33,645 --> 01:26:36,988
You think you're a bad man, Jay?

1098
01:26:37,088 --> 01:26:40,668
I thought I was a fucking bad man,
remember that?

1099
01:26:40,768 --> 01:26:44,790
I thought I was fucking bad,
and they put me in a big-man jail,

1100
01:26:44,890 --> 01:26:46,749
and look what happened to me.

1101
01:26:46,849 --> 01:26:48,506
You see this?

1102
01:26:48,606 --> 01:26:54,896
This is from where I tried to kill myself
because I couldn't cope in there.

1103
01:26:55,480 --> 01:26:58,269
You see these?
Look at them. Look at them!

1104
01:26:58,369 --> 01:27:03,507
I cut my arms so I wouldn't give them the
satisfaction of dealing out the most pain.

1105
01:27:03,607 --> 01:27:08,540
You know why they did it to me? Because
I thought I was fucking bad, and I wasn't.

1106
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:12,185
Now you wanna be bad. You think
you're big, Jay. You wanna be a big man.

1107
01:27:12,285 --> 01:27:16,535
You wanna be what I thought I was.
You wanna be me!

1108
01:27:19,880 --> 01:27:22,430
Then you fucking do it, blood.

1109
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:25,874
You see what happens to you.

1110
01:27:43,640 --> 01:27:45,640
Is this what you want?

1111
01:27:59,320 --> 01:28:03,350
- See, you're just like me, man.
- No, I'm nothing like you.

1112
01:28:03,450 --> 01:28:06,955
You ain't a killer, blood.
You're like me.

1113
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:09,675
You're nothing.

1114
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:14,895
I never meant to kill Trife, blood.

1115
01:28:18,080 --> 01:28:20,196
And I'm so sorry.

1116
01:28:32,520 --> 01:28:34,266
This ain't over, blood.

1117
01:28:34,366 --> 01:28:38,310
You really think this is over, blood?
This ain't fucking over, blood!

1118
01:28:38,410 --> 01:28:41,945
Where the fuck you going, blood?
You ain't got nowhere to go.

1119
01:28:42,045 --> 01:28:45,955
You ain't got no friends.
You ain't got no one.

1120
01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:52,070
This ain't over!

1121
01:28:56,280 --> 01:28:58,280
Yeah, it is.

1122
01:29:28,240 --> 01:29:33,510
Thought we could just go
tomorrow night, just as mates? Please.

1123
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:37,007
Call me when you get this.

1124
01:33:04,710 --> 01:33:06,710
