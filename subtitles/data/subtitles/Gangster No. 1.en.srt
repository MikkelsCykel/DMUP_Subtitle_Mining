1
00:01:01,694 --> 00:01:04,595
What, with Scotland Yard
breathing down me neck?

2
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:05,765
Fuck off!

3
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:16,701
"Do me a favor."

4
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:27,809
Solomons.

5
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:31,149
That was around the back, wasn't it?
Down that alley.

6
00:01:31,357 --> 00:01:35,418
We went there to meet,
what's his name? Mickey... Mick...

7
00:01:35,995 --> 00:01:37,223
- Mikey?
- No, no.

8
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:39,432
Harry... Harry...

9
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:43,936
Not Harry Michaels?

10
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:47,703
That was it! Harry Michaels,
Harry-fucking-Michaels.

11
00:01:47,907 --> 00:01:51,365
Of course it was.
Harry Michaels.

12
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:54,476
What was it about?

13
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,442
Didn't he have some problem?

14
00:01:56,649 --> 00:01:59,447
What the fuck is he going on about?

15
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:04,649
His brother had a record business
with a funny sort of name.

16
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:08,055
- I can see it spinning round.
- They usually do, Dodgy!

17
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:10,092
Someone take him home, eh?

18
00:02:10,396 --> 00:02:13,388
Barry! That was it. Barry.

19
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,559
Deram Records.
Barry...? Barry...? Barry...?

20
00:02:18,238 --> 00:02:20,900
Barry, Barry... What the fuck
am I talking about?

21
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:22,574
I'm fucked if I know.

22
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:25,539
Wouldn't think he just
got out of the clinic, eh?

23
00:02:51,137 --> 00:02:54,368
- Losing it?
- Fucking senile, ain't he?

24
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:02,737
Here, you'll never guess
who I bumped into the other day.

25
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:04,246
Larry Lord!

26
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:06,414
- Ol' Lordy?
- Yeah.

27
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:10,885
- Put on weight.
- Poor blimey.

28
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:12,682
Fat as a pig.

29
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,963
Here, here, here.

30
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:21,030
Talking of golden oldies...

31
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:24,829
...Freddie Mays is
getting out next week.

32
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:28,166
Be good to see old Freddie
again after... What is it?

33
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:30,342
Thirty years?

34
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,773
That's a bit of a stretch,
ain't it, eh?

35
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:35,072
Lock up your daughters!

36
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:37,249
Lock up your granny, more like!

37
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:47,182
Hello. Where's he gone?

38
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,418
You haven't invited him
to the party, eh?

39
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:52,387
"Do me a favor!"

40
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,426
You done well for yourself,
didn't you?

41
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:33,729
Come here, pops.

42
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:42,214
Here you are, grandad.

43
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,243
Go get yourself a nice bird.

44
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:00,227
What do you take me for?

45
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:01,931
A cunt?

46
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,950
<i>This is 1968.</i>

47
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:37,122
<i>I'm playing Jack the Lad at snooker,</i>
<i>when all of a sudden...</i>

48
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,321
<i>...Fat Charlie's come in.</i>

49
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:42,496
<i>Not that he was fat,</i>
<i>'cause he wasn't. He was skinny.</i>

50
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:45,102
<i>But he was called fat</i>
<i>'cause his mum was fat.</i>

51
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:48,933
<i>It's how he was distinguished from</i>
<i>the other Charlie, "Skinny" Charlie.</i>

52
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:52,543
<i>Now he was fat. But it was</i>
<i>too late by then to swap it around.</i>

53
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:55,179
<i>Anyway, he says to me:</i>

54
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:57,609
"Go and see Freddie Mays."

55
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,778
<i>Fucking hell!</i>
<i>My heart was going mad.</i>

56
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:06,891
<i>Freddie Mays.</i>

57
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:10,824
<i>Freddie Mays,</i>
<i>"The Butcher of Mayfair."</i>

58
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:13,898
<i>The man was a legend.</i>

59
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:19,199
<i>He'd done a copper in Bethnal Green</i>
<i>and got away with it, for fuck's sake!</i>

60
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:23,469
<i>That's how you get to the top.</i>

61
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:25,439
<i>Kill a bent cop. Make a splash.</i>

62
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:28,973
<i>After that, Freddie was king.</i>

63
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:45,023
<i>What a place.</i>

64
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:47,722
<i>A fucking palace!</i>

65
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:09,348
<i>In he came.</i>

66
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:14,515
<i>There he was, in those handmade</i>
<i>Italian leather shoes, silk socks.</i>

67
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:18,493
<i>The suit? Do me a favor.</i>
<i>The man was class.</i>

68
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:20,393
<i>A class act.</i>

69
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:24,969
<i>Style. Im-fucking-peccable.</i>
<i>What a man.</i>

70
00:08:25,738 --> 00:08:28,036
<i>I mean, a real man.</i>

71
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:31,938
How you doing?

72
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:33,940
Yeah, good.

73
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,342
Do you want a drink?

74
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:39,182
Yeah.

75
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:43,617
You look a bit scared, son.
Are you scared?

76
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:45,524
No.

77
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:48,851
<i>Scared?</i>

78
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,861
<i>I didn't need a drink.</i>
<i>I was drunk enough.</i>

79
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:54,396
<i>Drunk on the smell</i>
<i>of Italian leather.</i>

80
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,000
<i>Arse-holed on the smell of success.</i>

81
00:08:57,203 --> 00:09:00,331
I hear you've been hanging
around with Mad John.

82
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,668
This incident last week,
apparently you did well.

83
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:04,740
Yeah.

84
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,976
Trevor heard that as well,
didn't you, Trev?

85
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:17,379
- He thinks you're a bit of a laugh.
- Does he?

86
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:21,385
He's a wideboy, our Trevor.
Bit of an independent thinker.

87
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:24,859
Enjoys taking the piss.
Things he gets up to.

88
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:29,494
See, when you work for me
you do things my way.

89
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:31,067
No going behind me back.

90
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:33,568
No going out on your own.

91
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,205
And there's no independent
fucking thinking.

92
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,842
Oh, fuck!

93
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:39,835
Freddie...

94
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:43,982
- Because it irks me.
- For fucking sakes!

95
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:51,521
Yeah, that's the word. "Irks."

96
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:54,117
Anyway...

97
00:09:54,827 --> 00:09:57,421
...it appears we have a vacancy.

98
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,964
You're in, son.

99
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:04,101
<i>Straight off he gives</i>
<i>me 500.</i>

100
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:06,294
<i>Five hundred in me hands!</i>

101
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:08,336
<i>This is 1968!</i>

102
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,702
Do me a favor.
Take out the rubbish.

103
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:24,289
Oh, and get yourself kitted out.

104
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:47,345
<i>There we were, suited up.</i>
<i>Wasted on these fucking toerags.</i>

105
00:10:58,124 --> 00:11:00,615
Come here, you cunt!

106
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:05,661
Come here, cunt!

107
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,711
No! No! No!

108
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:27,879
- Give me until next Thursday, please.
- Thursday never fucking comes!

109
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:31,523
<i>"Give me until next Thursday"?</i>
<i>Slags.</i>

110
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,582
<i>It's pathetic.</i>

111
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:38,230
<i>Fucking excuses. All sorts.</i>
<i>From A to zed, the whole alphabet.</i>

112
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:39,455
<i>Jokers.</i>

113
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:42,930
<i>Later, they're in the Green Man</i>
<i>giving it the big one...</i>

114
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:45,535
<i>...like you're Harry the Spastic!</i>

115
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:48,804
Hold him.

116
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:52,377
- Hey, what's the problem?
- You are!

117
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:54,910
Nothing I can't fix
with a few tools, eh?

118
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:56,672
Come on, don't do this shit!

119
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,941
While I waste my time
with an arsehole?

120
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:01,210
Remember the last time
we went through this?

121
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,581
That put a smile on your face,
didn't it?

122
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:08,285
Leather seats, sir?
Better roll down the windows.

123
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:11,752
Freddie, come on.
It's not even my taxi.

124
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:16,130
It's not even my fucking taxi,
you bastard!

125
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:18,398
What are you looking at?

126
00:12:22,808 --> 00:12:26,175
Freddie! Don't fucking do it,
you bastard!

127
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,572
What is it with you, you cockneys, eh?

128
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:32,808
There you go.

129
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:36,284
I know a bloke who'll
take a look at that for you.

130
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:39,013
Now let's see that money, eh?

131
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:40,556
By tomorrow.

132
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:45,861
- Come on!
- Freddie!

133
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:51,200
No! No!

134
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:55,697
Get back to work, you lazy cunt!

135
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:59,741
Now, let's get this car
back on the road, eh?

136
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:02,675
- Hold him.
- No! Please! No!

137
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:08,914
Now, Giggler, you stay lucky, eh?

138
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,554
Get it off me!
Get it off me!

139
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:13,350
- You all right?
- Yeah.

140
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:18,426
Nice. Very nice.

141
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,056
Creative.

142
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:24,231
I like that. It deserves a drink.
What are you having?

143
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:31,766
Put it on. Here we go.

144
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:34,243
Is it on?

145
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:35,708
Here we go!

146
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:39,706
Go on, Billy!

147
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:46,448
My old woman loves this one.
Pity she ain't here.

148
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:50,995
Nice bit of bubbly, darling?

149
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:53,959
Not right now.

150
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:58,231
Piss for fucking carpet, ain't it?

151
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:03,006
Charlie, you got no sausage rolls?

152
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:19,080
If we had a good day...
Well, we always had a good day...

153
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:20,952
- we'd end up at Fat Charlie's.

154
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,289
The whole gang of us.

155
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:25,156
There was Mad John.

156
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:27,561
Yeah, well, he was really mad.

157
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:29,256
Billy Not-So-Smart.

158
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:32,895
Roland. Always with two birds.

159
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,504
Derek. One would do for him.

160
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:39,774
Eddie.

161
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:41,446
Poor little Eddie.

162
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:44,912
And Tommy, Freddie's old house pet.

163
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:47,415
Happy as fucking monkeys in a cage.

164
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,554
Shag pile and Babycham.

165
00:14:49,755 --> 00:14:52,553
No ambition. Not like Freddie.

166
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:54,419
Not like me.

167
00:14:57,529 --> 00:14:58,427
Yeah?

168
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:00,655
Shut up a minute!

169
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:04,762
Turn that fucking music off!

170
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:07,402
Eddie!

171
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,766
Turn it off!

172
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:13,942
Turn the music up, Eddie!

173
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:17,241
- Turn the music on.
- Turn the bloody music...

174
00:15:19,818 --> 00:15:20,842
Right.

175
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:24,215
Boys...

176
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,583
- Get in the car.
- What?

177
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:28,419
The club's on fire.

178
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:31,523
- Club's on fire?
- See you later, love.

179
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:33,857
Come on, Derek.

180
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:36,159
Let's get a move on, Derek.
Come on.

181
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:37,392
All right, all right.

182
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:56,884
- How long you been here?
- Just pulled up.

183
00:15:57,089 --> 00:15:58,386
- Did you see anyone?
- No.

184
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:00,518
No one on the door?

185
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:03,627
It was supposed to be Joe.
I don't know where he is.

186
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:06,195
- Everyone get out?
- Yeah, I think so.

187
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:08,693
Tell him.

188
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:13,166
I'm really sorry, Freddie.

189
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:17,172
What's he gonna do, take it
out of your wages? Tell him.

190
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:21,339
There were two of them.
Table six.

191
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,911
Ordered champagne.
Didn't eat nothing.

192
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:26,641
Couple of minutes after they left:
Whoosh!

193
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:29,685
- Lennie Taylor.
- Regulars, were they?

194
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:32,686
All right, it was an oversight.
She's paid for it.

195
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,555
All right, angel,
try and describe them.

196
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:39,392
What's he up to?

197
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:03,846
<i>Lennie Taylor's goons.</i>

198
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,950
<i>Torching our club?</i>

199
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:15,558
<i>Lennie Taylor, you cunt.</i>
<i>Think you're better than Freddie Mays?</i>

200
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:21,104
<i>Lennie-fucking-Taylor,</i>
<i>you little piece of dead meat.</i>

201
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,009
Pea-brained little fuck!

202
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:27,275
What did I say?

203
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:29,674
What did I fucking say?

204
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:38,153
Right out in the open!

205
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,793
What did I tell you?

206
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:44,986
What do you do?
What do you go and do?

207
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:48,495
- He was one of them.
- You shut your fucking mouth!

208
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:50,926
<i>What was I supposed to do?</i>

209
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:55,201
<i>He started the fire.</i>
<i>He fucking shot at me.</i>

210
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:56,465
Fuck!

211
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:01,442
<i>Being flash and a coon...</i>

212
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:03,410
<i>...Roland had to be different.</i>

213
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:06,413
<i>Goes in with the shaft,</i>
<i>bends the fucking thing.</i>

214
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:09,951
<i>I tell a lie,</i>
<i>breaks the fucking thing.</i>

215
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:11,144
<i>Bish-bosh.</i>

216
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:15,986
<i>Mad John's doing his feet</i>
<i>with meticulous attention to detail.</i>

217
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,753
<i>Billy's doing his ribs.</i>

218
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,323
<i>Stone Age xylophone.</i>

219
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,667
He'll be all right.

220
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:24,160
All right?

221
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,900
The cunt's in traction
for the next nine months.

222
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,598
Might need a wheelchair!
Plastic surgeon!

223
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:31,707
All right?

224
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:37,042
It is not fucking all right.
It is all fucking wrong, you morons!

225
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:40,083
<i>Saw him about a year later.</i>

226
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:43,311
<i>Some scarring, bit of a limp.</i>
<i>Seemed all right.</i>

227
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:45,490
<i>He bought me a drink.</i>
<i>What can I say?</i>

228
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:47,249
<i>He misbehaved.</i>

229
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:50,189
<i>Got punished.</i>

230
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:51,692
Fuck!

231
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,227
Fore!

232
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:56,162
<i>Should've seen the looks</i>
<i>when we returned the clubs.</i>

233
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:57,801
Remember what I said?

234
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:01,172
"This is a delicate matter."

235
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:06,107
What do you do? You go
and give the cunt a handicap.

236
00:19:13,785 --> 00:19:15,719
Fucking grief you've caused me.

237
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:20,484
"Fuck what Freddie says!"
Is that it, eh?

238
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:21,884
Is it?

239
00:19:22,127 --> 00:19:23,992
There's the chair.
Who wants it?

240
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:27,059
There it is! Come on, who wants it?

241
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:29,966
Come on, who wants it?

242
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:48,012
No.

243
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:53,283
You ain't got the bollocks,
none of you.

244
00:19:56,929 --> 00:20:00,194
And you, you cunt!

245
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:05,893
Striding along like John Wayne, looking
for a fucking bullet in your brain.

246
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,071
Arsehole!

247
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:13,543
Right.

248
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:18,550
Now I've gotta go speak to
that shit Lennie Taylor.

249
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:19,739
No. Sit down.

250
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:22,577
You.

251
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:24,514
You're coming with me.

252
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:28,084
- Now?
- Yes, now.

253
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:37,697
Don't use it.

254
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,482
- What you having?
- Whiskey.

255
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:34,716
That's it.

256
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:45,730
- It's on the house.
- No, that's for you.

257
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:48,030
Fucking hell. Thanks.

258
00:21:58,216 --> 00:22:01,413
Well, well, well.
This is nice.

259
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,419
- Hello, Freddie.
- All right, Lennie.

260
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,724
- Long time, no see.
- Yeah.

261
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:12,758
Bobby.

262
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:25,536
Take a walk.

263
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,185
I went to see him today.

264
00:22:37,956 --> 00:22:38,945
Yeah?

265
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:41,484
Hospital.

266
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:44,690
No, no, thanks.

267
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,825
I took him up some flowers,
some grapes.

268
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:53,032
Nice.

269
00:22:57,976 --> 00:23:00,774
I should have took him up
some fucking Nesquik.

270
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:03,772
Cunt's got no teeth.

271
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:07,819
I thought we sorted
our problems out, Freddie.

272
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:09,486
- Oh, did you?
- Yes, I did!

273
00:23:12,023 --> 00:23:13,320
What's this about, then?

274
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:16,651
- Why are you here?
- Why do you think?

275
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:22,064
You want to go to war with me,
Freddie?

276
00:23:22,634 --> 00:23:24,033
That what this is about?

277
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:26,033
<i>Oi, look at me.</i>

278
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:29,472
<i>Oi, camel cunt. Look at me.</i>

279
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:32,670
<i>Look into my fucking eyes.</i>

280
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:35,176
--Fucking Fry's Turkish Delight!

281
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:37,138
Come on, me and you outside!

282
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:39,442
Outside!
We'll have a straightener!

283
00:23:39,651 --> 00:23:42,051
We'll sort it out.
Who's who and what's what!

284
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:44,819
What, you scared?
Are you scared?

285
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:45,990
Lennie...

286
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,992
...why don't you just sit down?

287
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:51,285
Sit down?

288
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:56,323
Sit down? You come into my club,
telling me to sit down?

289
00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:58,799
You long streak of fucking piss!

290
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:00,904
Lennie, don't fuck around.

291
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:03,700
My place was petrol-bombed.

292
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:07,341
It's about that, is it?

293
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:11,004
Four thousand it cost me.
Four-fucking-thousand.

294
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:20,182
Oh, Freddie, Freddie, Freddie.

295
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:23,761
Listen, when I heard about that...

296
00:24:24,396 --> 00:24:26,455
...I couldn't have been
more surprised.

297
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:28,098
I was...

298
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,699
I was gutted.

299
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:36,764
I hope you ain't insinuating that
that had anything to do with me.

300
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:38,499
Because that would be wrong.

301
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:41,907
My conscience is clear.

302
00:24:42,247 --> 00:24:43,509
<i>Look at me.</i>

303
00:24:43,715 --> 00:24:45,979
Burning clubs ain't my game.

304
00:24:46,184 --> 00:24:48,277
<i>Look into my fucking eyes.</i>

305
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:53,116
If I want to come
after you, Freddie...

306
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,218
...I'll fucking come after you.

307
00:24:57,629 --> 00:25:00,325
It's our fucking...
Maxie, Maxie, Maxie!

308
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:06,634
<i>Oh, dear, Maxie.</i>
<i>Just you wait, son.</i>

309
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:13,767
<i>But that's nothing compared</i>
<i>to what happened to Lennie Taylor.</i>

310
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:19,513
He's a good boy, though, eh?

311
00:25:21,052 --> 00:25:22,849
He ain't scared, is he?

312
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:33,589
All right.

313
00:25:35,233 --> 00:25:36,063
All right.

314
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:40,568
Let's just say he did work for me.

315
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:42,002
Did.

316
00:25:44,242 --> 00:25:46,301
That's not to say I gave the order.

317
00:25:47,612 --> 00:25:50,775
Let's just say,
for the sake of argument...

318
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:56,718
...that someone's come in your club
with a lighted cigarette.

319
00:25:59,524 --> 00:26:01,014
They've dropped it in a bin...

320
00:26:01,593 --> 00:26:03,891
...and a subsequent fire's ensued.

321
00:26:04,763 --> 00:26:07,425
And let's say for the same
sake of argument...

322
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:10,493
...that my man slipped in the showers.

323
00:26:11,836 --> 00:26:13,997
Or someone's dropped
a taxi on his head.

324
00:26:16,274 --> 00:26:17,866
Well, these things happen.

325
00:26:19,477 --> 00:26:20,876
How does that sound?

326
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:24,914
- Sounds about right, doesn't it?
- Yeah.

327
00:26:25,116 --> 00:26:27,084
Sounds about right, doesn't it?

328
00:26:38,797 --> 00:26:40,458
Come here. Come here.

329
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:46,232
Bobby, Bobby!
Bubbly.

330
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:48,129
Let's have a nice drink, eh?

331
00:26:57,849 --> 00:27:00,010
Fucking warm champagne.

332
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:03,720
Fucking prick!

333
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,784
Listen.

334
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:13,455
- You want to get a proper drink?
- Yeah, go on then.

335
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:15,323
Right.

336
00:27:37,922 --> 00:27:41,119
<i>He had on that gray</i>
<i>two-piece mohair.</i>

337
00:27:41,593 --> 00:27:45,791
<i>That was a great suit.</i>
<i>Immaculate cut. Italian.</i>

338
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:47,624
<i>Always with a white shirt.</i>

339
00:27:48,199 --> 00:27:49,689
<i>Always.</i>

340
00:27:50,101 --> 00:27:52,035
<i>His ruby cuff links.</i>

341
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:54,897
<i>I loved them.</i>
<i>I fucking loved them.</i>

342
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:59,204
<i>Beautiful watch.</i>
<i>Wafer thin. Solid gold.</i>

343
00:27:59,711 --> 00:28:02,805
<i>Hardly know you've got it on.</i>
<i>Bond Street.</i>

344
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:04,606
<i>Two and a half grand.</i>

345
00:28:10,488 --> 00:28:12,479
You like this tiepin, don't you?

346
00:28:17,662 --> 00:28:18,686
Here.

347
00:28:20,165 --> 00:28:21,097
Have it.

348
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:51,853
Hi.

349
00:29:52,056 --> 00:29:54,354
Sorry I'm late, it's pissing down.

350
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:57,186
Fuck it. Don't worry about it.

351
00:29:57,395 --> 00:30:01,195
- Mel went on for you.
- I bet she's pissed off with me.

352
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:05,597
Livid. Called you everything:
"Fucking new girl comes in late...

353
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:10,468
...the second day. Bleeding tart.
I'm earning her fucking money for her."

354
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:14,103
I'm joking. I'm not serious.

355
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:17,475
I'm making it up.
She don't care.

356
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:19,612
What's your name again?

357
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:20,748
Karen.

358
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:27,848
We drinking wine?

359
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:31,888
- Yeah, why?
- It's a bit suspect, isn't it?

360
00:30:33,064 --> 00:30:34,588
Good for the blood.

361
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,165
- Freddie Mays is in.
- On his own?

362
00:30:45,376 --> 00:30:47,071
No, with a mate.

363
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,374
Who's Freddie Mays?

364
00:30:50,715 --> 00:30:54,776
- Table two, but he's mine.
- Only he don't know that yet.

365
00:30:56,654 --> 00:30:58,713
Right, let's see.

366
00:30:59,123 --> 00:31:01,717
Chateaubriand. Rare.

367
00:31:01,926 --> 00:31:04,724
- Asparagus. Potatoes gratin.
- Bollocks.

368
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:09,299
No dessert, black coffee.
Espresso. It's called espresso.

369
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:13,762
Might even order a cigar after.
Cuban. See what you make of that.

370
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:15,803
- Blow your fucking mind.
- You reckon?

371
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:18,703
Yeah. And I've
organized some company.

372
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:19,877
What do you mean?

373
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:24,109
You know, couple of blokes
on our own, drinking wine...

374
00:31:24,315 --> 00:31:26,215
Bit suspect, isn't it?

375
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:32,682
Mel and you. What's your name?

376
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:33,823
- Karen.
- Right.

377
00:31:34,025 --> 00:31:38,121
I want the two of you to go and
keep Freddie and his goon company.

378
00:31:38,796 --> 00:31:40,559
The ad didn't mention that.

379
00:31:40,765 --> 00:31:43,632
Don't suck him off or anything,
just keep him company.

380
00:31:43,835 --> 00:31:46,360
He's clean, he's well-mannered
and he's rich.

381
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:49,369
If you like him, be my guest.
Marry the cunt.

382
00:31:50,541 --> 00:31:52,702
Count yourself lucky, girl.
He's nice.

383
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,742
Not like most of them in here.

384
00:31:54,946 --> 00:31:58,040
How many times have I told you?
Don't bad-mouth the club.

385
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:00,012
This is a class emporium.

386
00:32:03,388 --> 00:32:05,219
- Where're you going?
- To the bog.

387
00:32:10,395 --> 00:32:12,625
Table two, Karen.
I'll be over in a minute.

388
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:16,496
Mind if I sit down?

389
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:19,861
Suit yourself.

390
00:32:21,306 --> 00:32:24,935
I was told you were well-mannered,
Mr. Freddie Mays.

391
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:28,208
What makes you think
I'm Freddie Mays?

392
00:32:28,546 --> 00:32:29,672
Woman's intuition.

393
00:32:29,881 --> 00:32:31,644
I also heard you're a gentleman.

394
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:32,873
Did you, now?

395
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:34,381
Yep.

396
00:32:34,585 --> 00:32:35,916
And that you're rich.

397
00:32:37,555 --> 00:32:39,420
Fucking gold digger, then?

398
00:32:40,158 --> 00:32:43,719
No, I'm not a fucking gold digger.
I'm a normal working girl.

399
00:32:43,928 --> 00:32:45,452
So you're a hooker.

400
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:48,690
Well, Freddie Mays don't pay for it.

401
00:32:51,669 --> 00:32:54,934
And I don't sit around in clubs
taking shit from gangsters.

402
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:57,073
So much for the gentleman crap.

403
00:32:57,275 --> 00:32:59,937
I guess they have to talk you up,
you're important.

404
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:05,172
Karen, I want you to meet
Freddie Mays.

405
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:07,382
Hello.

406
00:33:09,354 --> 00:33:11,049
Hello, Mr. Mays.

407
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:14,255
And you are?

408
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:21,426
Mel, why don't you treat
my friend to a dance?

409
00:33:22,233 --> 00:33:24,133
You're having a laugh, ain't you?

410
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:26,269
Sorry about the table manners.
Come on.

411
00:33:28,873 --> 00:33:31,000
Come on, he don't bite!

412
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:34,410
Please, sit down.

413
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:40,139
Sorry about that.

414
00:33:41,252 --> 00:33:42,583
Who is he?

415
00:33:43,654 --> 00:33:46,748
Just a business associate.

416
00:33:59,504 --> 00:34:01,301
Here, let me do that.

417
00:34:15,286 --> 00:34:16,275
Thank you.

418
00:34:21,826 --> 00:34:24,294
- Sorry, do you want one?
- No, thank you.

419
00:34:24,495 --> 00:34:26,554
I have to look after my voice.

420
00:34:26,998 --> 00:34:29,364
- What's that, then? You an actress?
- No.

421
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,592
Could be an actress, face like that.

422
00:34:31,803 --> 00:34:36,035
- Thank you. Appreciate it.
- Don't mention it.

423
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,800
- No, I sing.
- You sing?

424
00:34:39,043 --> 00:34:41,307
- What, here?
- No, I dance here.

425
00:34:44,482 --> 00:34:47,110
<i>Jane, June, Jackie...</i>

426
00:34:47,318 --> 00:34:51,277
<i>...Jessica, Julie.</i>
<i>She got bumped pretty sharpish.</i>

427
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:54,788
<i>That's the J's. On to K.</i>

428
00:34:54,992 --> 00:34:56,960
<i>"K" for Karen.</i>

429
00:34:57,161 --> 00:34:59,652
<i>Freddie Mays</i>
<i>and all his skinny birds.</i>

430
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:05,095
<i>Oh, dear Freddie.</i>
<i>Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.</i>

431
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,131
Sing something then.

432
00:35:08,973 --> 00:35:10,998
Go on. Get up and sing something.

433
00:35:11,209 --> 00:35:12,176
Sing something?

434
00:35:12,376 --> 00:35:15,368
I thought you meant here at the table.
For you.

435
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:18,208
No, I mean get up. Up on the stage.

436
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:19,474
Yeah, right.

437
00:35:20,084 --> 00:35:22,518
Any requests, Mr. Mays?

438
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,746
"Freddie." Go on, I'm serious.

439
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:28,187
I don't think management
would approve.

440
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:31,125
Oh, don't worry about the management.

441
00:35:34,866 --> 00:35:38,358
- I was talking to the girls backstage.
- Yeah?

442
00:35:38,569 --> 00:35:41,732
- Said you was a bit of an animal.
- Oh, really? Did they?

443
00:35:43,074 --> 00:35:44,336
Did they say which bit?

444
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:47,241
- Did they specify?
- No.

445
00:35:47,445 --> 00:35:50,073
Anyway, don't change the subject.
Hang on.

446
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:51,509
- What?
- Hang on.

447
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:53,245
Move.

448
00:35:57,455 --> 00:35:59,650
<i>Just another bird.</i>

449
00:35:59,857 --> 00:36:04,157
<i>Just another skinny fucking bird.</i>

450
00:36:04,695 --> 00:36:06,686
Good evening, everyone.

451
00:36:06,898 --> 00:36:08,195
This is for Mr. Mays.

452
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:10,456
Freddie.

453
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:15,166
- Freddie.
- Shut up.

454
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:18,634
- You like her then?
- I said, shut it.

455
00:37:10,828 --> 00:37:13,524
<i>And you, Mr. Freddie Mays.</i>

456
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:18,566
<i>You had to go swimming in her eyes,</i>
<i>dancing in her hair.</i>

457
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:23,763
<i>You had to slip into her mouth,</i>
<i>slide over her tongue...</i>

458
00:37:24,041 --> 00:37:28,478
<i>...fall down her throat,</i>
<i>deep down into her belly...</i>

459
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:32,945
<i>...right into her blood.</i>
<i>You had to fall asleep...</i>

460
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:37,519
<i>...wrapped around her beautiful,</i>
<i>beating heart.</i>

461
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:03,106
<i>Six months later</i>
<i>we're in the Zephyr...</i>

462
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:07,808
<i>...me and Roland going past</i>
<i>the Double Six.</i>

463
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:10,817
Hold up. Park up along here.

464
00:38:17,595 --> 00:38:19,358
<i>Roland's pulled over.</i>

465
00:38:19,563 --> 00:38:21,622
Isn't that Lennie Taylor?

466
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:24,531
But who that there with him?

467
00:38:24,735 --> 00:38:26,669
- It ain't.
- It can't be.

468
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:31,965
It is. It fucking well is.
That's Eddie Miller.

469
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:36,704
<i>Eddie? Eddie Miller?</i>

470
00:38:36,914 --> 00:38:39,940
<i>That was Eddie Miller talking</i>
<i>to Lennie Taylor.</i>

471
00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:47,016
<i>What would Lennie want with</i>
<i>a little shit like Eddie Miller?</i>

472
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:50,593
<i>Poor little Eddie.</i>

473
00:38:50,795 --> 00:38:53,355
<i>Run, rabbit, run.</i>

474
00:39:08,212 --> 00:39:11,340
I can't believe it.
I just can't believe it.

475
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:16,086
That dirty little Judas.
I bet you they're doing something.

476
00:39:16,587 --> 00:39:18,350
Do you know something, Roland?

477
00:39:18,556 --> 00:39:22,788
I've never understood one fucking
word you've ever said to me.

478
00:39:22,993 --> 00:39:24,927
So shut up. Let me deal with this.

479
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,273
Sheila?

480
00:39:45,182 --> 00:39:46,171
Who is it?

481
00:39:47,952 --> 00:39:49,920
It's the big, bad wolf.

482
00:39:51,655 --> 00:39:54,283
Oh, it's you.

483
00:39:58,295 --> 00:40:00,820
Oh, I was just making
some sweet tea.

484
00:40:01,031 --> 00:40:02,623
Would you like a cup?

485
00:40:03,467 --> 00:40:05,367
Fuck me. Hello, Roland.

486
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:12,967
Do you take sugar?

487
00:40:14,178 --> 00:40:15,770
Sit down, Eddie.

488
00:40:35,299 --> 00:40:37,733
- What's that?
- That?

489
00:40:39,537 --> 00:40:41,528
That's my favorite ax, Eddie.

490
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:46,902
Gentle Jesus, meek and mild.
Please bless all babies...

491
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:50,080
...make children safe enough.
- Eddie, look at me.

492
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:54,482
- I can't.
- Eddie...

493
00:40:54,685 --> 00:40:56,516
...look in my fucking eyes.

494
00:40:57,721 --> 00:41:00,019
Look in my fucking eyes.

495
00:41:12,837 --> 00:41:14,395
Get up! Come on.

496
00:41:14,605 --> 00:41:16,300
Come on. It's all right.

497
00:41:16,507 --> 00:41:17,906
Come on, sit down.

498
00:41:19,109 --> 00:41:21,600
All right? You all right?

499
00:41:23,747 --> 00:41:25,715
Now listen, listen.

500
00:41:27,251 --> 00:41:28,684
Deep breaths.

501
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:36,790
What did Lennie Taylor want, Eddie?

502
00:41:39,196 --> 00:41:40,595
Lennie?

503
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:54,945
What did Lennie Taylor want, Eddie?

504
00:41:55,145 --> 00:41:58,945
I was having a light ale
and minding my own fucking business.

505
00:41:59,149 --> 00:42:01,310
- You know what I'm like.
- No, I don't.

506
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:02,816
Maxie picked me up.

507
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,681
I didn't know what they wanted.

508
00:42:04,889 --> 00:42:06,982
I'm a thief.
I'm just a fucking thief!

509
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:09,091
All that has nothing to do with me!

510
00:42:09,293 --> 00:42:11,523
Thief?
You couldn't rob your own arsehole.

511
00:42:11,729 --> 00:42:14,459
- Freddie, he's a lovely man.
- Yeah.

512
00:42:14,665 --> 00:42:18,431
He's good to me, but his business
is none of my business.

513
00:42:18,636 --> 00:42:22,538
I was in the Prussia, minding
my own business, having a light ale.

514
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,731
The place goes quiet. I hear my name.

515
00:42:24,942 --> 00:42:28,935
"Eddie." Oh, fuck. It's Maxie.
It's Maxie King. Camel coat. Nutty.

516
00:42:29,146 --> 00:42:31,740
You are so fucking boring.
You bored?

517
00:42:31,949 --> 00:42:33,246
- You bored? I'm bored.
- What's he want?

518
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:35,418
- You're being boring.
- Lennie Taylor...

519
00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:37,086
...wants to see me.

520
00:42:37,288 --> 00:42:39,654
I've got to go and see him.
I can't not go.

521
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:42,254
What am I gonna do? Not go?

522
00:42:42,459 --> 00:42:43,687
And then what?

523
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:46,328
So I'm squashed in beside Maxie...

524
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:48,259
...and this big bloke in this Rover.

525
00:42:48,465 --> 00:42:51,730
- No one's saying nothing. Dead quiet.
- Get on with it!

526
00:42:51,936 --> 00:42:53,927
- They take me to a club.
- The Double Six.

527
00:42:54,138 --> 00:42:56,470
That's right. Oh, fuck!

528
00:42:57,508 --> 00:43:01,035
Look, Lennie was there.
And he was...

529
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:03,736
...asking questions about Freddie.

530
00:43:03,948 --> 00:43:05,381
But I told him to fuck off.

531
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:06,743
- Did you?
- Yeah.

532
00:43:06,951 --> 00:43:08,919
Yeah, I said I'll have a drink...

533
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:12,145
...but don't go asking
me questions about Freddie.

534
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:17,985
What sort of questions, Eddie?

535
00:43:19,997 --> 00:43:21,555
What sort of questions?

536
00:43:28,238 --> 00:43:29,899
What sort of questions, Eddie?

537
00:43:30,407 --> 00:43:32,238
I can't fucking remember.

538
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:33,740
I think you'd better try, son.

539
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:36,242
Lennie reckons Freddie's losing it.

540
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:37,971
- Does he?
- Yeah, you know.

541
00:43:38,182 --> 00:43:41,208
- "Love makes you fat" sort of thing.
- Love makes you fat.

542
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:44,347
- Go on.
- But, that's it.

543
00:43:46,256 --> 00:43:48,156
It's a lovely place, the Double Six.

544
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:51,385
It's swanky. Loads of crumpet.

545
00:43:51,595 --> 00:43:52,789
Lennie seemed half-decent.

546
00:43:52,997 --> 00:43:57,400
I can't remember what was said, but I
do know that I didn't say nothing.

547
00:44:07,745 --> 00:44:09,110
Look at me.

548
00:44:12,049 --> 00:44:13,038
Look at my eyes.

549
00:44:18,389 --> 00:44:20,448
I'm telling you the truth.

550
00:44:22,726 --> 00:44:24,284
Eddie.

551
00:44:25,963 --> 00:44:28,693
Look in my fucking eyes.

552
00:44:32,536 --> 00:44:35,562
They're gonna do Freddie! Oh, God!

553
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:38,767
Friday, outside the Candelabra.

554
00:44:40,644 --> 00:44:44,444
God! Look...
Listen, I've told you now.

555
00:44:44,648 --> 00:44:46,878
I've told you.
You've gotta warn Freddie.

556
00:44:47,084 --> 00:44:49,484
You've gotta tell Freddie, please!

557
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:52,053
Shall we tell him?
We'll go and warn Freddie.

558
00:44:52,256 --> 00:44:55,453
We'll go and warn him, eh?

559
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:02,262
I love that...
Do you like that smell?

560
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:06,431
That kiddie smell.

561
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:08,770
It's lovely.

562
00:45:09,573 --> 00:45:10,597
Kids, eh?

563
00:45:11,508 --> 00:45:13,499
Be the fucking death of you.

564
00:45:16,747 --> 00:45:18,009
Eddie, come here.

565
00:45:19,683 --> 00:45:21,014
Eddie?

566
00:45:21,952 --> 00:45:23,852
Want you to look at me.

567
00:45:24,855 --> 00:45:26,789
- Eddie?
- I can't.

568
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:28,355
- Look at me.
- I can't.

569
00:45:32,196 --> 00:45:35,427
- Look at me.
- I can't do it. I can't do it.

570
00:45:35,632 --> 00:45:38,123
Look what you've gone and done, eh?

571
00:45:38,335 --> 00:45:40,360
Look what a mess you've made, eh?

572
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:44,032
- Come on, eh?
- I can't.

573
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:47,506
- I can't! Look, I can't. I can't!
- Eddie.

574
00:45:47,711 --> 00:45:50,407
- Put your hands down.
- Oh, fuck!

575
00:45:50,614 --> 00:45:53,105
Just look at me.
That's all I'm asking.

576
00:45:53,317 --> 00:45:57,117
Look at me. That's it.

577
00:45:57,321 --> 00:45:59,414
Weren't so difficult, was it?

578
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:03,116
It's all right.

579
00:46:06,363 --> 00:46:07,694
All right.

580
00:46:09,566 --> 00:46:11,124
Ta, Eddie.

581
00:46:13,871 --> 00:46:15,065
No, I'm telling you.

582
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:17,399
Lennie Taylor is nothing
but a little...

583
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:19,872
<i>Driving, Roland's talking about...</i>

584
00:46:20,077 --> 00:46:21,704
<i>...going straight to tell Freddie.</i>

585
00:46:21,912 --> 00:46:25,575
<i>Freddie Mays, Freddie Mays.</i>

586
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:27,307
<i>I know something you don't.</i>

587
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:37,287
You don't deal with them kind of...

588
00:46:37,494 --> 00:46:40,895
<i>Pull over, Roland. Puncture.</i>

589
00:46:47,504 --> 00:46:48,630
So where's this puncture?

590
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:51,774
It's not your side?
Felt like it was your side.

591
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:58,409
Well, me no see nothing.

592
00:47:00,017 --> 00:47:01,917
What you trying to do?

593
00:47:02,853 --> 00:47:05,321
I was stroking your frizzy hair.

594
00:47:08,759 --> 00:47:10,420
Oh, fucking things!

595
00:47:10,627 --> 00:47:13,494
Charlie, let me do that.
You take the tea in.

596
00:47:13,697 --> 00:47:14,959
Come on.

597
00:47:17,434 --> 00:47:18,901
Wrong knife.

598
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:24,464
Cheers, Charlie. Ta.

599
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:40,285
- All right, girl?
- Yeah.

600
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:43,152
- You putting on a bit of weight?
- Shut up.

601
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:46,625
I'll have one of them, please.
Cheers. Ta.

602
00:47:47,598 --> 00:47:48,963
Ta, darling.

603
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:22,665
Fucking headless, it said.

604
00:48:23,667 --> 00:48:25,692
Fucking torso.

605
00:48:27,604 --> 00:48:29,697
- Imagine that, eh?
- John.

606
00:48:32,342 --> 00:48:35,004
Karen, maybe you should go down,
wait in the car.

607
00:48:38,882 --> 00:48:41,715
Maybe you should go down
and wait in the car, eh?

608
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:44,046
Take the shortcut
through the window.

609
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:46,017
It's all right.
He's just old-fashioned.

610
00:48:46,857 --> 00:48:48,620
Don't think I want to be here anyway.

611
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:54,196
You want to watch your mouth.

612
00:48:58,902 --> 00:49:01,837
- Right, what were we saying?
- It's gotta be him.

613
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:04,837
Let's take a look.
All we know is, a body's been found.

614
00:49:05,042 --> 00:49:07,135
A black body,
and one of ours is missing.

615
00:49:07,344 --> 00:49:10,313
It's Roland.
He's been missing for five days.

616
00:49:10,514 --> 00:49:11,845
Don't mean it's him, does it?

617
00:49:12,049 --> 00:49:15,314
What we're getting to is this:
If it is him, it's them.

618
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:17,419
It's two and two now? It all adds up.

619
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:20,988
Fucking right it does.
What the fuck are we waiting for?

620
00:49:21,191 --> 00:49:23,250
Let's go now. Hit them now.

621
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:26,554
We gotta get uglier, Freddie.
Take the initiative.

622
00:49:26,763 --> 00:49:31,166
I'll show those bastards torsos.
I'll cut their fucking arms off!

623
00:49:31,368 --> 00:49:34,804
He never deserved it. Poor bastard.

624
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:39,434
Come on, Freddie.
Say fucking something.

625
00:49:40,911 --> 00:49:44,847
- Let's go now. Let's hit them now!
- All done. All done, John!

626
00:49:45,716 --> 00:49:47,206
Think about it.

627
00:49:47,417 --> 00:49:48,941
Why Roland?

628
00:49:50,887 --> 00:49:52,616
I mean, why not you?

629
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,814
Or Tommy? Me?

630
00:49:55,258 --> 00:49:56,555
All of us in one go.

631
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,660
Bang! Beautiful. Perfect.

632
00:49:58,862 --> 00:50:00,489
Fucking happy.

633
00:50:01,898 --> 00:50:04,025
Now, that would be a takeover.

634
00:50:04,234 --> 00:50:07,226
That'd be nice. That I can see.
But this...

635
00:50:08,205 --> 00:50:09,968
Don't make sense.

636
00:50:10,807 --> 00:50:13,037
Something does not make sense.

637
00:50:13,243 --> 00:50:14,574
Maybe it was meant for me.

638
00:50:14,778 --> 00:50:17,679
- Maybe it was meant for you!
- Shut it!

639
00:50:19,783 --> 00:50:22,081
And another thing,
what if it's someone else?

640
00:50:22,285 --> 00:50:24,776
- Who the fuck else could it...?
- Someone else!

641
00:50:25,389 --> 00:50:27,755
- Look, I just think we...
- Sit down!

642
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:33,518
Right.

643
00:50:35,065 --> 00:50:36,760
This is what we do.

644
00:50:37,768 --> 00:50:39,793
We wait.

645
00:50:41,104 --> 00:50:45,131
All right, you all got that? We wait.

646
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:48,270
We give it a couple of days.

647
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:51,378
And if he don't turn up, all right.

648
00:50:52,082 --> 00:50:53,743
So be it.

649
00:50:55,485 --> 00:50:57,578
All hell breaks loose.

650
00:52:20,904 --> 00:52:24,772
All right? All right, Freddie?

651
00:52:26,276 --> 00:52:27,868
What's going on, then?

652
00:52:31,882 --> 00:52:33,179
He gone deaf or something?

653
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:36,678
He doesn't want to be disturbed.
By anybody.

654
00:52:36,887 --> 00:52:38,878
I don't think that means me, does it?

655
00:52:39,089 --> 00:52:40,249
That's what he said.

656
00:52:41,091 --> 00:52:42,456
Cup of tea?

657
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:52,461
- Bomb, was it?
- No, we're redecorating.

658
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:54,899
Oh, are we?
Well, that's nice, isn't it?

659
00:52:57,641 --> 00:52:58,801
<i>Let a bird in your life...</i>

660
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:02,035
<i>...the next thing you know</i>
<i>the walls are all pink.</i>

661
00:53:02,245 --> 00:53:06,011
<i>There's potpourri all over</i>
<i>and knickers in your corn flakes.</i>

662
00:53:07,584 --> 00:53:10,553
So who's he in there with,
or is that a secret?

663
00:53:10,754 --> 00:53:13,120
No, he's in with Tommy.

664
00:53:13,323 --> 00:53:15,154
And Roland's sister.

665
00:53:23,133 --> 00:53:25,124
Listen, Karen...

666
00:53:25,802 --> 00:53:28,828
...we might have got off wrong,
and if it's my fault...

667
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:30,506
We can always start again.

668
00:53:32,142 --> 00:53:34,007
You know, you're not bad-looking.

669
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:37,237
Not bad-looking? Not bad-looking?

670
00:53:37,447 --> 00:53:39,347
- I'm a prince, darling.
- Yeah?

671
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:40,948
Oh, yeah.

672
00:53:41,151 --> 00:53:43,016
Why don't you find yourself
a nice girl?

673
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:45,484
- I could help you.
- Do me a favor.

674
00:53:45,689 --> 00:53:49,147
I've got so many birds,
they're coming out me ears.

675
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:51,691
I can't even hear myself think.

676
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:54,295
So, what's behind this then?

677
00:53:55,031 --> 00:53:56,259
Freddie's not allowed to see it.

678
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:58,692
What do you think, then?

679
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:01,867
Do you know,
it's not a bad likeness of Freddie.

680
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:04,540
Nose a bit on the large side, eh?

681
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:06,072
Very funny.

682
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:08,639
You know Freddie,
he's mad about horses.

683
00:54:08,845 --> 00:54:11,006
I thought it'd make
a nice engagement present.

684
00:54:11,214 --> 00:54:12,545
You what?

685
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:15,475
An engagement present.

686
00:54:15,685 --> 00:54:19,485
As in, me and Freddie,
getting married.

687
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:22,217
- Didn't he tell you?
- No, he didn't.

688
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:26,088
Are you up in the duff?
Can we hear the patter of tiny feet?

689
00:54:26,296 --> 00:54:29,891
- No, not yet.
- "No, not yet."

690
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,227
You're over the moon, ain't you?

691
00:54:32,435 --> 00:54:34,266
Hap-hap-happy.

692
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:37,963
That's a nasty way of putting it.

693
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:41,410
I've never been happier.

694
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:45,445
And I thought any mate of Freddie's
would be happy for him too.

695
00:54:46,383 --> 00:54:47,873
What's your problem?

696
00:54:48,184 --> 00:54:50,948
Ain't me that's got a problem,
darling, is it?

697
00:54:54,658 --> 00:54:56,182
I'm not surprised he didn't tell you.

698
00:54:57,327 --> 00:54:59,227
Not exactly over the moon, are you?

699
00:55:00,997 --> 00:55:04,023
There's something ugly
eating away inside of you.

700
00:55:04,234 --> 00:55:07,101
See it in your eyes.
I could see it a mile off.

701
00:55:07,871 --> 00:55:09,634
Well, I love Freddie.

702
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:14,139
I'd kill for that man. I don't
give a fuck whether you approve.

703
00:55:14,344 --> 00:55:19,008
I'll look after him, whatever it
takes. Do you understand me?

704
00:55:19,215 --> 00:55:21,911
Keep your fucking knickers on!

705
00:55:27,691 --> 00:55:29,989
Do you understand?

706
00:55:38,868 --> 00:55:40,597
Yeah, I'm sorry.

707
00:55:48,912 --> 00:55:50,903
I wish the best for you.

708
00:55:52,048 --> 00:55:53,481
Hope you're happy together.

709
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:56,208
- Yeah?
- Yeah, really.

710
00:55:57,387 --> 00:55:58,945
Congratulations.

711
00:56:01,958 --> 00:56:04,483
Tell Freddie I'll catch up
with him later.

712
00:56:05,962 --> 00:56:09,728
Tell him, you know, I'm happy for him.
For the both of you.

713
00:56:12,268 --> 00:56:13,792
Karen...

714
00:56:17,507 --> 00:56:19,737
Take good care of him, eh?

715
00:56:43,099 --> 00:56:46,364
<i>Well, what was he gonna do?</i>

716
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:49,129
<i>Crack open the bubbly,</i>
<i>smiling from ear to ear:</i>

717
00:56:49,339 --> 00:56:50,806
<i>"I'm getting engaged!"</i>

718
00:56:51,007 --> 00:56:55,341
<i>"Cor, blimey, you ain't?</i>
<i>Fuck me! Nice one! Congrats.</i>

719
00:56:55,545 --> 00:56:59,879
<i>You kept that under your hat.</i>
<i>You romantic old so-and-so."</i>

720
00:57:00,717 --> 00:57:04,983
<i>And I'm thinking,</i>
<i>"Love makes you fat." Poof.</i>

721
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:36,107
Run!

722
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:42,758
Karen, run!

723
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:45,427
- Run!
- This is for you, you fucking...

724
00:57:46,529 --> 00:57:49,020
Get off him! Get off him!
Get off him!

725
00:57:49,232 --> 00:57:50,722
Fucking gun that doesn't work!

726
00:57:50,934 --> 00:57:52,231
Help!

727
00:57:52,435 --> 00:57:54,869
- Get off him!
- Fucking cunt!

728
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:59,040
Want something done,
do it your fucking...

729
00:58:01,244 --> 00:58:02,802
You get back inside, you cunt!

730
00:58:04,747 --> 00:58:07,079
- Get off him!
- Maxie, shut her up!

731
00:58:07,717 --> 00:58:10,515
Get off him! Get off him!

732
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,813
- Maxie, please!
- Get off me!

733
00:58:13,022 --> 00:58:14,284
Not the girl!

734
00:58:19,362 --> 00:58:22,126
- Cut her!
- No!

735
00:58:25,535 --> 00:58:26,763
Please!

736
00:58:30,607 --> 00:58:34,008
Shoot me! Why don't you shoot me?

737
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:46,953
<i>What a comedy. What a skirmish.</i>

738
00:58:47,156 --> 00:58:49,920
<i>Look at his suit now, tatters.</i>

739
00:58:52,929 --> 00:58:57,457
<i>The bird's fucked,</i>
<i>but Freddie's still twitching.</i>

740
00:58:57,667 --> 00:58:59,965
<i>He starts to move.</i>

741
00:59:00,169 --> 00:59:04,629
<i>He tries to get up, falls back.</i>
<i>Hopeless.</i>

742
00:59:04,841 --> 00:59:08,607
<i>Tries again. Go on, son!</i>

743
00:59:08,811 --> 00:59:12,178
<i>Now, he's pulling himself</i>
<i>along the pavement.</i>

744
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:15,112
<i>Trail of blood like a bleeding slug.</i>

745
00:59:15,318 --> 00:59:18,310
<i>Come on, Freddie, two more yards.</i>

746
00:59:18,521 --> 00:59:21,456
<i>Fucking lying there</i>
<i>on your leather settee.</i>

747
00:59:23,326 --> 00:59:25,419
<i>That's it, Romeo.</i>

748
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:28,660
<i>Go on, give her a kiss.</i>

749
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,493
<i>Work the old magic.</i>

750
00:59:47,016 --> 00:59:49,007
<i>I've got a machete on the back seat...</i>

751
00:59:49,218 --> 00:59:53,712
<i>...a chopper on the passenger seat and</i>
<i>an old Beretta tucked in me trousers.</i>

752
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:56,084
<i>And I'm fucking happy.</i>

753
00:59:56,793 --> 00:59:58,124
<i>Green light.</i>

754
00:59:58,761 --> 01:00:00,194
<i>Green light.</i>

755
01:00:01,297 --> 01:00:02,662
<i>Green light.</i>

756
01:00:11,007 --> 01:00:13,805
<i>I pull up outside</i>
<i>where Lennie Taylor lives.</i>

757
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:17,036
<i>124 Jubilee Mansions.</i>

758
01:00:18,314 --> 01:00:22,410
<i>Here's me, outside</i>

763
01:00:33,329 --> 01:00:34,887
<i>See a car.</i>

764
01:00:35,765 --> 01:00:37,130
<i>Pick it up.</i>

<i>I'm filling up.</i>

01:01:07,964 --> 01:01:10,125
<i>I'm filling up.</i>

Don't mind if I do, Lennie.

You bastard! You...

795
01:02:08,791 --> 01:02:11,692
God, you cunt! You fucking cunt!

796
01:02:11,894 --> 01:02:14,362
You better make a fucking
good job of this!

797
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:17,294
You better make a fucking
good job of me!

798
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:19,866
Here, have a clock.

799
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:25,768
You bastard!

800
01:02:43,259 --> 01:02:46,751
Come on, then. Come on, then. Yes!

801
01:02:56,873 --> 01:02:59,933
Come on. Could you fucking
finish me off?!

802
01:03:00,143 --> 01:03:02,043
Fucking come and finish me off!

803
01:03:02,245 --> 01:03:04,611
Lost your fucking bottle,
have you?

804
01:03:04,814 --> 01:03:08,580
Lost the taste for it, have you?
Come on, fucking get on with it!

805
01:03:29,872 --> 01:03:31,305
Come on. Come on.

806
01:03:40,583 --> 01:03:43,143
Let's see what you've fucking got!

807
01:03:46,389 --> 01:03:48,653
Get all your fucking
pretty clothes off.

808
01:04:05,708 --> 01:04:07,676
Yeah, that's it.

809
01:04:14,317 --> 01:04:15,750
You ready?

810
01:04:17,553 --> 01:04:19,077
Yes.

811
01:04:25,761 --> 01:04:27,160
Who are you?

812
01:04:28,931 --> 01:04:30,922
Who are you? You're nothing.

813
01:04:32,001 --> 01:04:33,434
You're nothing.

814
01:04:36,873 --> 01:04:39,341
Look at you lying there like...

815
01:04:40,142 --> 01:04:44,408
...a piece of meat.

816
01:04:44,614 --> 01:04:46,411
Meat. Meat.

817
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:18,805
Who is it?

818
01:05:19,015 --> 01:05:20,312
Tommy.

819
01:05:24,086 --> 01:05:26,611
- Get dressed.
- Why, what's wrong?

820
01:05:27,123 --> 01:05:28,647
I'll be in the car.

821
01:05:35,131 --> 01:05:37,895
You gonna tell me what
this is all about, or what?

822
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:42,193
Freddie and Karen were jumped
outside the Candelabra.

823
01:05:42,405 --> 01:05:43,667
He what?

824
01:05:44,407 --> 01:05:46,398
They cut Karen's throat.

825
01:05:46,709 --> 01:05:48,336
Fuck me!

826
01:05:50,813 --> 01:05:52,576
And what about Freddie?

827
01:06:13,302 --> 01:06:15,668
Right, it's like this:

828
01:06:16,339 --> 01:06:19,137
He's not dead, but he's in a bad way.

829
01:06:20,276 --> 01:06:21,573
He's been cut to ribbons.

830
01:06:21,777 --> 01:06:24,837
Has 300-something stitches,
shot three times.

831
01:06:25,047 --> 01:06:27,880
He's on the lot.
Morphine, you name it.

832
01:06:28,484 --> 01:06:31,476
Now, they're gonna try
and operate again in the morning.

833
01:06:31,687 --> 01:06:34,281
It's touch-and-go. But he's strong.

834
01:06:35,157 --> 01:06:36,351
No.

835
01:06:38,394 --> 01:06:42,296
Look, you fucker, I want to
see Freddie. I want to see my mate.

836
01:06:42,498 --> 01:06:44,989
Not possible.
They won't let you see him.

837
01:06:45,201 --> 01:06:48,602
- There's a situation.
- What fucking situation?

838
01:06:48,804 --> 01:06:51,170
A serious fucking situation,
Tommy-boy.

839
01:06:51,374 --> 01:06:52,841
Fuck off!

840
01:06:53,042 --> 01:06:56,034
Listen. Listen to me closely, Tommy.

841
01:06:56,278 --> 01:06:58,303
Lennie Taylor has been killed.

842
01:06:58,514 --> 01:07:02,416
- What?
- Tonight. Hacked to death at home.

843
01:07:03,185 --> 01:07:05,346
Do you understand what that means?

844
01:07:05,721 --> 01:07:08,622
Christmas has come early
for my colleagues up there.

845
01:07:08,824 --> 01:07:11,258
They're charging Freddie with murder.

846
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:13,189
It's perfect.

847
01:07:13,396 --> 01:07:16,388
They've been after him a long time.
It's a win double.

848
01:07:16,599 --> 01:07:18,191
Freddie didn't kill Lennie.

849
01:07:18,401 --> 01:07:22,064
But what it comes down to is,
Freddie's finished.

850
01:07:22,571 --> 01:07:24,232
- Now piss off!
- Oh, yeah?

851
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:25,771
I want to see Freddie.

852
01:07:25,975 --> 01:07:27,272
Tommy, for fuck...

853
01:07:27,476 --> 01:07:30,775
You are some cunt.
It's just money to you, ain't it?

854
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:32,140
All right, Tom.

855
01:07:32,348 --> 01:07:35,784
There an admission price
for this fucking freak show?

856
01:07:35,985 --> 01:07:38,283
- Tommy, calm down.
- Is that fucking it?!

857
01:07:38,487 --> 01:07:41,285
Fuck off. Fuck off!

858
01:07:55,271 --> 01:07:56,465
All right, mate?

859
01:07:58,140 --> 01:07:59,630
Oh, Jesus.

860
01:08:02,044 --> 01:08:03,511
All right, son?

861
01:08:05,314 --> 01:08:06,975
Put that in your hand, eh?

862
01:08:07,516 --> 01:08:08,710
All right, mate?

863
01:08:13,422 --> 01:08:14,787
Poor fella.

864
01:08:18,060 --> 01:08:19,322
Jesus.

865
01:08:22,598 --> 01:08:23,997
Silence in court!

866
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:25,258
Show them, Freddie!

867
01:08:25,468 --> 01:08:29,336
<i>Old Judge Mumbling said, in</i>

868

<i>The murder of</i>
<i>Leonard Bertram Taylor...</i>

869

<i>"Silence in court!"</i>

<i>he'd ever had the misfortune to try.</i>

872
01:08:41,150 --> 01:08:43,744

873
01:08:43,953 --> 01:08:48,754
<i>...and gave him 30 years,</i>
<i>to serve a minimum of 25.</i>

874
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:49,856
<i>How's that?</i>

875
01:08:50,059 --> 01:08:51,185
Take him down!

876
01:08:51,393 --> 01:08:54,157
- Fuck off!
- Fucking arsehole!

877
01:08:54,363 --> 01:08:57,127

<i>- British justice, eh?</i>

878
01:08:57,500 --> 01:08:59,400

I told you. I fucking told you.

882
01:09:14,383 --> 01:09:17,011
Someone should listen to me
for a fucking change!

883
01:09:17,219 --> 01:09:19,687
- This wouldn't have happened...
- You was right!

884
01:09:19,889 --> 01:09:22,357
Well, so what?
It's no fucking good to us now.

885
01:09:22,558 --> 01:09:24,719
- Fucking right I was right.
- Tommy.

What's Maxie's fucking fate?

887
01:09:26,795 --> 01:09:29,093
That's why we're here.
Not this old fanny.

888
01:09:29,298 --> 01:09:31,528
- Don't be fucking stupid!
- Don't call me...

889
01:09:31,734 --> 01:09:35,534
All right, Del. He's right.
We can't go fucking near him.

Anything happens to Maxie,

...gonna do what he done
and get away with it.

894
01:09:47,349 --> 01:09:50,284
- There's no way he's gonna avoid me.
- John...!

895
01:09:50,486 --> 01:09:54,616
It's a difficult time. I'm trying
to deal with it as best I know.

896
01:09:54,924 --> 01:09:56,414
This ain't helping.

897
01:09:57,860 --> 01:09:59,054
He's dead.

898
01:09:59,261 --> 01:10:01,855
- He's fucking dead.
- All right. Just calm down.

899

Everyone, just fucking calm down.

You got something to say?

903
01:10:24,053 --> 01:10:27,147
Because if you have, say it.

904
01:10:28,357 --> 01:10:30,655
I want to hear it. Fucking say it.

905
01:10:32,661 --> 01:10:35,562
- You sure?
- Fucking say it!

906
01:10:36,699 --> 01:10:39,099
He's right. You're wrong.

Fucking right I'm right.

908

- I don't fucking know. You tell me.

Start crying?

914
01:11:14,803 --> 01:11:16,498

<i>Just like the old days.</i>

988
01:16:33,889 --> 01:16:35,356
Hello, Eddie.

989
01:16:37,159 --> 01:16:38,421
Hello.

990
01:16:39,127 --> 01:16:41,322
It's been a while, Eddie.

991
01:16:42,230 --> 01:16:44,858
We really should catch up.
Be nice, catching up.

992
01:16:45,067 --> 01:16:46,728
Let's catch up.

993
01:16:46,969 --> 01:16:48,197
Old mum well?

994
01:16:48,403 --> 01:16:50,394
Good, great, magic.

995
01:16:54,943 --> 01:16:57,776
What the fuck is going on
with Freddie Mays?

996
01:16:57,980 --> 01:16:59,504
When did he get out?

997
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:01,848
Wednesday.

998
01:17:02,117 --> 01:17:05,416
- Do you mind if I get back to work?
- No, no.

999
01:17:05,787 --> 01:17:08,312
Let's go somewhere more private.

1000
01:17:14,763 --> 01:17:18,096
I don't like it.
Nobody told me he was getting out.

1001
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:20,359
You don't know about
the wedding then?

1002
01:17:20,569 --> 01:17:22,799
Wedding? What fucking wedding?

1003
01:17:23,005 --> 01:17:24,472
Freddie's wedding.

1004
01:17:24,773 --> 01:17:26,604
Everyone will be there.

1005
01:17:27,042 --> 01:17:28,509
He's a well-tutored boy.

1006
01:17:29,678 --> 01:17:31,339
He's got a B.A.

1007
01:17:31,780 --> 01:17:33,645
Bachelor of Arts.

1008
01:17:34,049 --> 01:17:37,018
Who's he marrying, anyway?
Someone he met in the nick?

1009
01:17:37,219 --> 01:17:38,277
Karen.

1010
01:17:38,487 --> 01:17:39,579
You remember.

1011
01:17:39,788 --> 01:17:41,847
Singer. Lovely face.

1012
01:17:42,057 --> 01:17:44,389
Throat cut. Nearly died.

1013
01:17:54,469 --> 01:17:55,663
Eddie.

1014
01:17:56,938 --> 01:17:58,803
You ever kill somebody, Eddie?

1015
01:17:59,107 --> 01:18:00,096
How do you mean?

1016
01:18:00,308 --> 01:18:02,640
Well, you know, like, kill them?

1017
01:18:03,378 --> 01:18:05,005
What, like dead?

1018
01:18:05,447 --> 01:18:07,745
Yeah. Dead.

1019
01:18:08,050 --> 01:18:09,540
I'd have to say no.

1020
01:18:09,751 --> 01:18:10,911
Why not?

1021
01:18:11,353 --> 01:18:12,911
Well, I don't want to.

1022
01:18:13,121 --> 01:18:14,554
I think you could.

1023
01:18:14,756 --> 01:18:17,054
If it was somebody
you really hated, you know?

1024
01:18:17,259 --> 01:18:20,626
What, like, he starts something
with me and my family?

1025
01:18:21,063 --> 01:18:23,691
Now, look, I want to
ask you a question.

1026
01:18:23,899 --> 01:18:27,232
No ifs or buts.
I want a straight answer.

1027
01:18:27,736 --> 01:18:28,964
Who...

1028
01:18:29,771 --> 01:18:33,172
...if you had to choose,
would you sooner kill:

1029
01:18:33,809 --> 01:18:34,935
Me?

1030
01:18:35,143 --> 01:18:36,633
Or Freddie Mays?

1031
01:18:38,647 --> 01:18:41,309
- Truth?
- Yeah, truth!

1032
01:18:45,020 --> 01:18:46,282
You.

1033
01:18:54,029 --> 01:18:55,257
Sorry.

1034
01:19:00,001 --> 01:19:01,434
Can I ask you a question?

1035
01:19:01,636 --> 01:19:04,036
Yeah, yeah! Fire away.

1036
01:19:06,875 --> 01:19:08,968
Why haven't you killed me?

1037
01:19:09,177 --> 01:19:11,372
Who says I'm not going to?

1038
01:19:33,468 --> 01:19:34,560
Come on!

1039
01:19:34,770 --> 01:19:35,998
Come on!

1040
01:20:32,694 --> 01:20:33,991
Karen?

1041
01:20:38,099 --> 01:20:39,464
Karen.

1042
01:20:39,935 --> 01:20:42,495
Imagine bumping into you
after all this time.

1043
01:20:42,704 --> 01:20:44,069
It must be what, 25...

1044
01:20:44,272 --> 01:20:47,105
You know exactly how long it's been.

1045
01:20:47,309 --> 01:20:50,210
Well, I thought maybe you were dead.

1046
01:20:51,580 --> 01:20:54,447
Wow! Healed up nice.

1047
01:20:57,919 --> 01:21:00,444
I know why you're here.
Stay away from Freddie.

1048
01:21:00,655 --> 01:21:02,680
He don't want to see you,
hear from you...

1049
01:21:02,891 --> 01:21:06,156
...or smell you
and your cheap fucking aftershave.

1050
01:21:06,361 --> 01:21:10,821
Me and Freddie have waited too long
for some evil ponce to fuck things up.

1051
01:21:11,566 --> 01:21:14,126
That's not very ladylike, is it?

1052
01:21:14,336 --> 01:21:15,769
Fuck you, freak.

1053
01:21:17,072 --> 01:21:18,164
You stay away!

1054
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:22,139
- I told you, I'd kill for Freddie.
- Oh, yeah.

1055
01:21:22,344 --> 01:21:24,471
You told me a lot of things.

1056
01:21:24,679 --> 01:21:26,613
"You're not a bad-looking bloke.

1057
01:21:26,815 --> 01:21:29,613
Why don't you find
yourself a nice girl?"

1058
01:21:30,986 --> 01:21:33,887
What makes you think
that you're so special?

1059
01:21:34,489 --> 01:21:37,617
You know, I wouldn't mind a wife.
Someone to love.

1060
01:21:38,460 --> 01:21:40,587
I deserve some love.

1061
01:21:41,529 --> 01:21:43,520
I want a Valentine's card.

1062
01:21:43,732 --> 01:21:47,395
I don't care if she is a slag.
I'll look after her all right.

1063
01:21:47,736 --> 01:21:49,203
Spoil her.

1064
01:21:49,671 --> 01:21:51,434
Buy her stuff.

1065
01:21:52,340 --> 01:21:54,501
Maybe I'd like
to settle down sometime.

1066
01:21:54,709 --> 01:21:56,438
Nobody ever thinks about that.

1067
01:21:56,645 --> 01:22:00,308
I mean, nobody ever thinks about me!
Well, fuck you!

1068
01:22:00,582 --> 01:22:04,143
You tell Freddie I want to see him,
or there'll be consequences.

1069
01:22:04,352 --> 01:22:07,287
Serious fucking consequences.

1070
01:22:08,456 --> 01:22:11,755
Get out of my fucking way, you cunt!

1071
01:22:17,966 --> 01:22:19,490
So, Freddie...

1072
01:22:24,873 --> 01:22:26,864
Heard you was getting hitched.

1073
01:22:27,075 --> 01:22:29,305
Getting yourself a ball and chain.

1074
01:22:32,047 --> 01:22:34,538
No, no, I didn't get no invitation.

1075
01:22:34,749 --> 01:22:36,376
No, not to worry.

1076
01:22:37,852 --> 01:22:40,082
I couldn't have gone anyway.
Business.

1077
01:22:40,956 --> 01:22:43,481
Still, hope it all goes well.

1078
01:22:43,692 --> 01:22:48,720
And for my part, Freddie,
I'd just like to say congratulations.

1079
01:22:48,930 --> 01:22:50,397
You're out.

1080
01:22:51,032 --> 01:22:52,624
Fit and well.

1081
01:22:53,134 --> 01:22:54,624
And well...

1082
01:22:56,438 --> 01:22:58,030
...here's to you.

1083
01:23:48,323 --> 01:23:50,518
Love what you've done with the place.

1084
01:23:55,363 --> 01:23:57,092
Sit down, Freddie.

1085
01:24:13,214 --> 01:24:14,545
Been a long time.

1086
01:24:15,050 --> 01:24:16,176
Yeah.

1087
01:24:37,772 --> 01:24:38,966
Like a cup of tea?

1088
01:24:40,175 --> 01:24:41,972
Yeah, that would be nice.

1089
01:24:53,488 --> 01:24:54,546
Fuck.

1090
01:25:14,275 --> 01:25:15,435
So, Freddie...

1091
01:25:16,177 --> 01:25:17,508
...how you doing?

1092
01:25:18,646 --> 01:25:20,113
All right. Yeah.

1093
01:25:20,315 --> 01:25:21,373
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1094
01:25:22,217 --> 01:25:24,617
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1095
01:25:29,524 --> 01:25:32,015
Look, what do you want?

1096
01:25:39,801 --> 01:25:41,462
I hear you're getting married.

1097
01:25:42,804 --> 01:25:44,897
At some point, yeah.

1098
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:54,576
A little something. Go on, take it.

1099
01:25:55,416 --> 01:25:57,043
Go on, take it.

1100
01:25:57,585 --> 01:25:59,075
It's for you. Take it.

1101
01:26:01,990 --> 01:26:03,719
Freddie, I want you to take it.

1102
01:26:03,925 --> 01:26:07,691
I want you to take the money.
I took your money. You take my money.

1103
01:26:19,807 --> 01:26:21,468
Don't take it.

1104
01:26:25,413 --> 01:26:26,903
What do you want?

1105
01:26:29,117 --> 01:26:31,847
Oh, the flat. Is that it?
You want to move in?

1106
01:26:32,053 --> 01:26:33,748
You and Karen?

1107
01:26:34,155 --> 01:26:35,486
Cozy Karen?

1108
01:26:35,690 --> 01:26:38,215
Well, take it. I'm out of here.

1109
01:26:38,726 --> 01:26:40,387
Redecorate.

1110
01:26:42,797 --> 01:26:44,162
Why not, huh?

1111
01:26:44,365 --> 01:26:46,162
New carpet. Lick of paint.

1112
01:26:46,367 --> 01:26:47,356
Lovely.

1113
01:26:47,569 --> 01:26:49,434
Patter of tiny feet.

1114
01:26:49,804 --> 01:26:53,035
Yeah, well, you're probably past it.
Can't get it up.

1115
01:26:53,241 --> 01:26:55,266
And she's no spring chicken.

1116
01:26:55,944 --> 01:26:58,276
Probably come out
all twisted and mental.

1117
01:26:58,479 --> 01:27:00,743
Baby Freddie. Spastic.

1118
01:27:00,949 --> 01:27:04,407
She's barren, probably, all dried up.
But you could adopt.

1119
01:27:09,123 --> 01:27:10,112
What do you want?

1120
01:27:16,564 --> 01:27:18,259
The shoes, is it?

1121
01:27:18,466 --> 01:27:20,331
The handmade fucking shoes?

1122
01:27:20,602 --> 01:27:21,626
Here.

1123
01:27:22,170 --> 01:27:23,967
They're yours. Have them.

1124
01:27:24,172 --> 01:27:26,163
Take them. They're yours.

1125
01:27:26,641 --> 01:27:28,973
The tiepin? Oh, you like the tiepin?

1126
01:27:29,177 --> 01:27:33,910
Fuck me, it's even got your initials
on it. Take it! Here, it's yours!

1127
01:27:35,083 --> 01:27:38,575
- You're mad.
- No, it's you.

1128
01:27:38,786 --> 01:27:41,516
You drive me fucking nuts, you do.

1129
01:27:43,024 --> 01:27:44,321
I don't want your flat...

1130
01:27:44,525 --> 01:27:48,017
...I don't want your shoes,
and I don't want your fucking tiepin.

1131
01:27:49,897 --> 01:27:51,626
That Freddie's dead.

1132
01:27:53,968 --> 01:27:56,630
What is it with you? I mean...

1133
01:27:57,038 --> 01:27:59,006
...where you coming from?

1134
01:28:00,575 --> 01:28:05,342
Explain it to me, because I'd like
to know. Really, I want to know.

1135
01:28:07,015 --> 01:28:09,540
What have you got that I haven't got?

1136
01:28:10,418 --> 01:28:13,876
I done better than you.
I'm the better man.

1137
01:28:14,355 --> 01:28:17,051
Wasn't me who spent
fuck knows how long inside.

1138
01:28:17,258 --> 01:28:19,692
Fucking professor.

1139
01:28:22,363 --> 01:28:23,523
What?

1140
01:28:23,731 --> 01:28:26,598
You think I wouldn't kill you?
Do you think that?

1141
01:28:26,801 --> 01:28:29,395
Just because it's you.
Is that what you think?

1142
01:28:31,105 --> 01:28:33,573
Oh, I can kill somebody. It's easy.

1143
01:28:34,008 --> 01:28:37,239
It's easy to kill somebody.
It's nothing.

1144
01:28:42,350 --> 01:28:44,250
I avenged you.

1145
01:28:46,554 --> 01:28:48,545
I didn't want to kill Lennie Taylor.

1146
01:28:51,859 --> 01:28:54,589
I did not want to kill Lennie Taylor.

1147
01:28:59,801 --> 01:29:01,632
I didn't enjoy it.

1148
01:29:02,370 --> 01:29:05,134
Had to be done.
Somebody had to do it.

1149
01:29:07,608 --> 01:29:08,802
Yeah.

1150
01:29:09,677 --> 01:29:14,080
Karen spent the past 30 years telling
me the whole thing stank of you.

1151
01:29:14,982 --> 01:29:16,540
That bitch.

1152
01:29:28,830 --> 01:29:29,990
Take it.

1153
01:29:30,832 --> 01:29:32,197
Take it.

1154
01:29:32,734 --> 01:29:34,326
Pick it up.

1155
01:29:35,002 --> 01:29:37,266
There it is. Pick it up.

1156
01:29:38,206 --> 01:29:39,696
Shoot me.

1157
01:29:39,907 --> 01:29:42,603
Shoot me! Shoot me, you cunt!

1158
01:29:43,244 --> 01:29:45,576
Who do you think you are?

1159
01:29:46,247 --> 01:29:47,976
Pathetic.

1160
01:29:48,916 --> 01:29:50,008
Yeah.

1161
01:29:50,852 --> 01:29:52,820
Oh, yeah, I was.

1162
01:29:53,554 --> 01:29:55,112
I was vain.

1163
01:29:55,323 --> 01:29:56,950
I was a prat.

1164
01:29:57,525 --> 01:30:00,585
Handsome Freddie Mays,
"Butcher of Mayfair."

1165
01:30:00,795 --> 01:30:02,990
What a load of old cobblers.

1166
01:30:03,798 --> 01:30:05,959
Who'd want to be Freddie Mays?

1167
01:30:08,936 --> 01:30:11,598
- Fuck off.
- You're a nutter.

1168
01:30:11,806 --> 01:30:14,832
Well, I ain't going away,
so you may as well kill me.

1169
01:30:15,042 --> 01:30:18,205
Come on! Kill me! Come on!

1170
01:30:18,413 --> 01:30:21,849
For old time's sake.
Down memory lane and all that.

1171
01:30:24,986 --> 01:30:26,180
I was there.

1172
01:30:29,123 --> 01:30:30,522
"Get your hands off her!"

1173
01:30:30,725 --> 01:30:32,659
"Karen!"

1174
01:30:32,860 --> 01:30:34,293
"Maxie, please, no!

1175
01:30:34,495 --> 01:30:38,488
Not the girl! Not the girl! No!"

1176
01:30:39,734 --> 01:30:42,464
Sound familiar? Huh?

1177
01:30:42,670 --> 01:30:45,104
You, crawling around
in your own blood.

1178
01:30:45,306 --> 01:30:48,366
Pathetic. Hilarious.

1179
01:30:48,576 --> 01:30:50,237
Maxie's got his knife out.

1180
01:30:50,445 --> 01:30:51,241
No!

1181
01:30:51,446 --> 01:30:54,108
Come on, Freddie. Come on.

1182
01:30:54,649 --> 01:30:57,413
Maxie with his blade
digging at her flesh.

1183
01:30:57,618 --> 01:30:59,313
Ripping that lovely throat.

1184
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:01,249
- Karen!
- No!

1185
01:31:01,956 --> 01:31:03,150
And you going:

1186
01:31:03,357 --> 01:31:07,054
"Shoot me, shoot me," like a sick cow.

1187
01:31:07,962 --> 01:31:09,190
<i>Come on, Freddie.</i>

1188
01:31:09,397 --> 01:31:10,921
Come on.

1189
01:31:12,200 --> 01:31:14,896
<i>Come on, Freddie, two more yards.</i>

1190
01:31:15,937 --> 01:31:16,961
What?

1191
01:31:17,171 --> 01:31:18,536
What's that she's saying?

1192
01:31:18,739 --> 01:31:19,797
Love you.

1193
01:31:20,007 --> 01:31:21,372
Love you.

1194
01:31:22,109 --> 01:31:23,098
What's that?

1195
01:31:23,578 --> 01:31:25,705
<i>"I love you, Freddie.</i>

1196
01:31:25,913 --> 01:31:27,210
I love you.

1197
01:31:27,415 --> 01:31:30,009
I love you, Freddie. I love you..."

1198
01:31:33,821 --> 01:31:34,810
What?

1199
01:31:35,923 --> 01:31:37,652
Does she still love you?

1200
01:31:37,859 --> 01:31:40,692
With your pruney bollocks
and your old bird's hair?

1201
01:31:43,798 --> 01:31:46,096
Handsome Freddie Mays.

1202
01:31:50,705 --> 01:31:54,539
How could she still love you?
Seeing what you are?

1203
01:31:55,276 --> 01:31:57,107
I mean, what are you? A cunt?

1204
01:31:57,311 --> 01:31:59,506
What are you? Milky tea?

1205
01:32:04,452 --> 01:32:06,283
Come on, Romeo.

1206
01:32:06,587 --> 01:32:08,919
Give her a kiss.
Yeah, work the old magic.

1207
01:32:11,559 --> 01:32:13,186
Come on, Freddie.

1208
01:32:16,197 --> 01:32:17,459
Come on, my son.

1209
01:32:22,570 --> 01:32:24,094
Shoot me.

1210
01:32:27,074 --> 01:32:28,939
Shoot me!

1211
01:32:30,912 --> 01:32:33,403
Kill me!

1212
01:32:33,614 --> 01:32:34,774
Shoot me!

1213
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:55,433
I'm just an old man in a crap suit.

1214
01:32:59,006 --> 01:33:00,769
I like it that way.

1215
01:33:36,110 --> 01:33:37,407
Bitch!

1216
01:33:57,932 --> 01:34:00,492
<i>One day I'll catch up with you.</i>

1217
01:34:01,502 --> 01:34:03,163
<i>You want a war?</i>

1218
01:34:03,537 --> 01:34:07,735
<i>I'll give you a fucking war,</i>
<i>one arm tied behind me back.</i>

1219
01:34:09,610 --> 01:34:11,100
<i>I'd shoot you.</i>

1220
01:34:11,312 --> 01:34:13,576
<i>Blow you to kingdom come.</i>

1221
01:34:14,248 --> 01:34:16,443
<i>They'll need a dustpan and brush...</i>

1222
01:34:16,651 --> 01:34:18,278
<i>...to scrape you off the walls.</i>

1223
01:34:18,486 --> 01:34:20,784
<i>Make mincemeat out of you.</i>

1224
01:34:20,988 --> 01:34:24,355
<i>Pie and mash. Puddles of blood.</i>

1225
01:34:25,092 --> 01:34:26,992
<i>I'll leave you lying there...</i>

1226
01:34:27,194 --> 01:34:29,025
<i>...the rotten lot of you.</i>

1227
01:34:30,598 --> 01:34:31,963
<i>Calling me a cunt.</i>

1228
01:34:32,166 --> 01:34:33,861
Calling me a cunt.

1229
01:34:34,068 --> 01:34:36,161
Calling me a cunt.

1230
01:34:36,370 --> 01:34:37,769
You cunt!

1231
01:34:37,972 --> 01:34:39,337
I'll fucking kick you.

1232
01:34:39,540 --> 01:34:44,273
I'll kick fuck out of you.
I'll kick you to fuck. Fuck you!

1233
01:34:44,478 --> 01:34:46,309
<i>Rip your face off.</i>

1234
01:34:47,381 --> 01:34:48,905
<i>I'll fucking...</i>

<i>Freddie Mays.</i>

1239
01:35:08,235 --> 01:35:10,795
<i>I don't need you, Freddie.</i>

1240
01:35:12,573 --> 01:35:13,597
<i>Who am I?</i>

1241
01:35:17,978 --> 01:35:19,878
I'm Superman!

1242

King-fucking-Kong!

1243

I can pick you up
and throw you a million miles!
