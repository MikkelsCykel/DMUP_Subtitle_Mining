1
00:01:08,498 --> 00:01:13,646
British Airways flight 297 from London
now arriving at gate 12.

2
00:02:17,581 --> 00:02:18,475
Hi.

3
00:02:20,845 --> 00:02:23,812
Rooms are at 39 bucks
day rate, 29 bucks overnight.

4
00:02:25,132 --> 00:02:27,401
- Well, it's cheaper to stay overnight.
- Damn right!

5
00:02:27,724 --> 00:02:30,276
Days are for sex.
Sex costs money.

6
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:34,118
- Want a room or not?
- Yes for a week, please.

7
00:02:34,441 --> 00:02:37,310
That will be 203 bucks in advance.

8
00:02:47,685 --> 00:02:49,822
It will be unit 13.

9
00:02:51,364 --> 00:02:53,665
Check-out at noon
Thursday night.

10
00:02:59,169 --> 00:03:00,957
No, I'm fine.
Thank you.

11
00:04:15,724 --> 00:04:18,057
What's up, man!
Come here!

12
00:04:34,085 --> 00:04:35,131
Open Gate 6!

13
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:45,146
- Are you alright?
- Yeah.

14
00:04:46,496 --> 00:04:47,925
Glad you could make it, bro.

15
00:04:48,737 --> 00:04:52,248
What the fuck did you go to Chicago, anyway?
Are there not trade back home?

16
00:04:52,384 --> 00:04:55,831
Their expensive lake views
and corn fed American pussies, why ask?

17
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,096
Jesus. Are you on the streets
long enough again?

18
00:05:02,109 --> 00:05:06,068
Okay I'm here, Reese.
You said you make it worth my while.

19
00:05:07,227 --> 00:05:08,274
Listen.

20
00:05:09,178 --> 00:05:12,657
Somebody is a dog track.
And they think it was me.

21
00:05:12,793 --> 00:05:14,768
- But you are innocent.
- Of course I am.

22
00:05:14,969 --> 00:05:16,562
The bad guys wore masks.

23
00:05:16,695 --> 00:05:20,207
Plus, one of them got
accidentally killed by the cops.

24
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:25,171
The car is getting north bound
in Lower Wacker  and Van Buren.

25
00:05:27,348 --> 00:05:28,493
I see it.

26
00:05:30,933 --> 00:05:33,451
- Goddamnit!
- Shut fuck up.

27
00:05:46,032 --> 00:05:47,526
What the fuck happened, Reese?

28
00:05:47,631 --> 00:05:50,411
Fucking crooked cops getting on duty!
That's what fucking happened.

29
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:51,942
Bastards!

30
00:06:06,922 --> 00:06:07,782
Get out!

31
00:06:07,848 --> 00:06:08,742
Get out!

32
00:06:09,224 --> 00:06:10,368
Get the fuck out!

33
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,962
He's got a gun!
He's got a gun!

34
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,086
Drop the gun!

35
00:06:18,277 --> 00:06:20,098
You in the truck,
let me see your hands!

36
00:06:22,405 --> 00:06:24,608
Put them up!
Let me see your hands!

37
00:06:43,198 --> 00:06:44,147
Get in the car.

38
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:47,897
No witnesses, no money,
no conviction, right?

39
00:06:48,381 --> 00:06:49,787
How much did they get?

40
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,266
- These bad guys?
- At least half a million.

41
00:06:53,403 --> 00:06:54,263
Maybe more.

42
00:06:55,354 --> 00:06:56,564
Okay, I'm interested.

43
00:06:57,465 --> 00:06:58,358
Where?

44
00:07:00,473 --> 00:07:01,420
I had to toss it.

45
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,695
- Where?
- Dan Ryan expressway.

46
00:07:08,278 --> 00:07:09,293
Asshole!

47
00:07:10,071 --> 00:07:12,142
Reese, what the fuck are you doing?
Our money!

48
00:07:12,277 --> 00:07:13,171
Shut the fuck up, will you?

49
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:14,892
Do you think it's still there?

50
00:07:16,659 --> 00:07:17,968
- It's not there.
- Then where is it?

51
00:07:18,069 --> 00:07:20,304
Well, it landed on this guy's car,
you know. A white-do.

52
00:07:20,562 --> 00:07:23,114
- Okay, what kind of car?
- An old car.

53
00:07:23,282 --> 00:07:26,576
Old station wagon.
Wood on the sides, you know?

54
00:07:27,216 --> 00:07:28,328
Yeah, wood on the sides.

55
00:07:42,284 --> 00:07:43,942
Shit!
Fucking piss!

56
00:07:44,683 --> 00:07:45,961
Son of a bitch!

57
00:07:47,914 --> 00:07:48,808
Why me?

58
00:07:49,034 --> 00:07:54,564
Ten zillion fucking cars in goddamn
Chicago and this motherfucker ass...

59
00:08:18,753 --> 00:08:19,767
Jesus Christ.

60
00:08:31,421 --> 00:08:32,915
You want to shower first?

61
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:35,733
No, you go ahead.

62
00:08:36,956 --> 00:08:37,883
Okay.

63
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,657
Don't be down, Sam.
It will all work out.

64
00:09:01,396 --> 00:09:02,770
You want me to pick you up at work?

65
00:09:03,091 --> 00:09:05,938
No, I'll meet with you.
The walk will do me good.

66
00:09:39,849 --> 00:09:41,277
- See you later, then?
- Yeah.

67
00:09:53,765 --> 00:09:54,658
Damn!

68
00:09:56,868 --> 00:09:58,176
What the hell are you doing, man?

69
00:09:58,403 --> 00:10:00,540
Jesus Christ, Reese!
Are you fucking crazy?

70
00:10:00,674 --> 00:10:02,015
Fucking keep it down!

71
00:10:04,993 --> 00:10:06,454
In Chicago, Reese.

72
00:10:07,329 --> 00:10:11,124
The car capital of the northern USA
and you expect me to find one fucking car.

73
00:10:11,264 --> 00:10:13,881
- Forget it, your boy got lucky.
- Listen to me.

74
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:17,329
This barney came into his
lock only two days ago.

75
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:19,858
The trail is still hot to
the street or snatch.

76
00:10:20,093 --> 00:10:24,433
He'll use cash and that's what set him
apart from the other worker and folks.

77
00:10:25,211 --> 00:10:27,928
First thing he'll do is buy
a new car , cash...

78
00:10:28,058 --> 00:10:29,202
and that's how you get him.

79
00:10:29,273 --> 00:10:32,885
Now split is 50-50.
Are you in or out?

80
00:10:34,616 --> 00:10:35,891
I'm here, aren't I?

81
00:10:37,847 --> 00:10:38,926
I'll give my best shot.

82
00:10:59,441 --> 00:11:01,862
- You're the sales manager?
- Yeah, that's me.

83
00:11:07,886 --> 00:11:08,900
Can you help me?

84
00:11:12,685 --> 00:11:13,928
I'm sure as hell try.

85
00:11:17,547 --> 00:11:20,513
If somebody comes in here
and buys a car for cash...

86
00:11:21,546 --> 00:11:22,494
what do you do?

87
00:11:22,857 --> 00:11:24,264
Cream in my calvins.

88
00:11:28,616 --> 00:11:30,022
What official things do you do?

89
00:11:30,567 --> 00:11:34,657
Well, since there is no bank,
there's no loan application,

90
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:38,979
no insurance, papers to fill out
and no loan officer, see.

91
00:11:39,301 --> 00:11:41,634
But the only thing we
do on a cash deal...

92
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:44,386
is to document the state tax
and licensing.

93
00:11:44,482 --> 00:11:46,141
- How?
- It's a form.

94
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:47,392
Here.

95
00:11:47,778 --> 00:11:50,111
But I gotta tell you
cash is rare.

96
00:11:50,177 --> 00:11:53,307
Once, maybe two times a year
do I see a cash deal.

97
00:11:53,441 --> 00:11:55,262
Is this document
method of payment?

98
00:11:55,392 --> 00:11:56,765
Right there on that line, see?

99
00:11:56,863 --> 00:11:59,164
You have to list the bank,
the finance company ...

100
00:12:00,445 --> 00:12:01,820
or you stamp it "cash".

101
00:12:02,142 --> 00:12:06,134
- And where do this go?
- Chicago DMB, Central Branch.

102
00:12:12,955 --> 00:12:13,968
Thank, buddy.

103
00:12:14,042 --> 00:12:17,107
Hey, you're welcome.
You rude fucking gumba.

104
00:12:19,608 --> 00:12:21,974
I can't imagine why he's late,
Mr. Dale.

105
00:12:22,102 --> 00:12:23,509
He knew we're meeting
at 10:30.

106
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:26,933
I believe this is the very nature
of our problem, Ms. Phelan.

107
00:12:27,062 --> 00:12:29,166
Buying a house
is a major responsibility.

108
00:12:29,268 --> 00:12:33,129
I do not think Mr. Phelan is facing his
commitment in a responsible manner.

109
00:12:33,716 --> 00:12:37,097
You and your husband are 120
days behind in payments.

110
00:12:37,235 --> 00:12:41,903
This constitutes serious careers
to an institution of this small size.

111
00:12:42,034 --> 00:12:46,156
Mr. Dale, we know where we stand.
We've been unemployed.

112
00:12:46,544 --> 00:12:48,398
We're both working now,
we'll catch up.

113
00:12:48,527 --> 00:12:51,821
You're asking much of this institution
to reschedule your loan...

114
00:12:52,334 --> 00:12:55,017
especially in view of
Mr. Phelan's tardiness...

115
00:12:55,214 --> 00:12:57,929
both in legal payments
and today's appointment.

116
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,555
- Where have you been?
- I'll tell later.

117
00:13:00,972 --> 00:13:03,818
Mr. Dale, our banker.
Let me guess.

118
00:13:03,947 --> 00:13:05,926
You being the weany that you are,
you're not gonna

119
00:13:05,927 --> 00:13:07,907
reschedule our payments.
Is that right?

120
00:13:09,449 --> 00:13:10,496
What?

121
00:13:10,729 --> 00:13:11,809
What did you say?

122
00:13:14,663 --> 00:13:18,078
Under the circumstances,
I do not believe this institution ...

123
00:13:18,151 --> 00:13:20,191
can accommodate you,
Mr. and Mrs. Phelan.

124
00:13:20,293 --> 00:13:22,398
Stop, Sam, talk to him.
This is our house!

125
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:24,640
I'm afraid you have to pay
the full amount you owe

126
00:13:24,709 --> 00:13:27,457
or Midwest Savings and Loan
will be force to finalize foreclosure proceedings.

127
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:30,458
Mr. Dale, please.
We have paid on that house...

128
00:13:30,532 --> 00:13:33,498
every month on time for 5 years.
Doesn't that count for anything?

129
00:13:33,634 --> 00:13:35,772
What exactly is the full amount?

130
00:13:35,905 --> 00:13:40,442
With penalties and interest,
comes to $7603.12.

131
00:13:40,576 --> 00:13:41,469
Okay.

132
00:13:43,391 --> 00:13:44,284
Here.

133
00:13:44,446 --> 00:13:49,944
1 thousand, 2 thousand, 3 thousand,
4 thousand, 5 thousand, 6 thousand, 7 thousand ...

134
00:13:50,557 --> 00:13:51,450
and...

135
00:13:53,371 --> 00:13:54,964
- One, two, three ...
- 12 cents.

136
00:13:55,132 --> 00:13:56,789
Four, five, six.

137
00:13:57,339 --> 00:13:58,865
You got four singles?

138
00:14:00,345 --> 00:14:01,239
Four.

139
00:14:01,561 --> 00:14:02,455
Yeah.

140
00:14:05,304 --> 00:14:06,197
Thank you.

141
00:14:06,297 --> 00:14:09,329
U.S. $ 7605.

142
00:14:09,751 --> 00:14:11,277
Leslie, come on.

143
00:14:14,934 --> 00:14:16,014
Wait, my sweater.

144
00:14:19,507 --> 00:14:23,948
You owe me $1.88, bastard
and want it by noon tomorrow.

145
00:14:33,935 --> 00:14:36,837
- Where did you get it ?
- Straight from heaven, baby.

146
00:14:37,551 --> 00:14:39,176
No, really, Sam, where?

147
00:14:40,173 --> 00:14:42,410
I was on the Dan Ryan
expressway, right.

148
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:46,021
And a police chase went by,
and it just crashed onto the hood of my car.

149
00:14:47,212 --> 00:14:48,455
Did it dent the car?

150
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:51,047
Dented? Jesus, honey, forget that.
Come on.

151
00:14:52,585 --> 00:14:54,080
Oh my God.
How much is there?

152
00:14:54,249 --> 00:14:55,231
I don't know.

153
00:14:55,529 --> 00:14:56,641
You wanna find out?

154
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:50,193
How much, how much?

155
00:15:50,808 --> 00:15:51,756
Okay.

156
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:57,522
It comes to $618,127.

157
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:04,495
Wait, plus $7605 we give
that asshole Mr. Dale which makes...

158
00:16:05,268 --> 00:16:07,123
- Did you see his face?
- Yeah.

159
00:16:07,347 --> 00:16:09,735
I thought he was gonna pee in
his pants when you call him a weany.

160
00:16:09,906 --> 00:16:12,240
How's it about when you
hit him up with $1.88?

161
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:13,319
- Bastard!
- Bastard!

162
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:16,136
Okay.

163
00:16:18,064 --> 00:16:22,319
Counting the $7605
we gave the bank totals...

164
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:29,123
$625,731.

165
00:16:30,924 --> 00:16:32,134
My God!

166
00:16:34,251 --> 00:16:35,363
We're rich.

167
00:16:36,426 --> 00:16:38,117
Sam, we can't keep it.

168
00:16:38,601 --> 00:16:42,561
- Yes we can.
- No. It's probably dirty money.

169
00:16:42,696 --> 00:16:43,906
Yeah, of course it is.
It's cash.

170
00:16:44,042 --> 00:16:46,277
I don't want some Colombian drug
lord kicking our door down.

171
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,261
Hey, nobody saw it, Les.

172
00:16:48,327 --> 00:16:51,555
If I hadn't picked it up, it would've just
laid on the ground for somebody else to find.

173
00:16:51,686 --> 00:16:54,685
It's free and clear money.
Nobody in this world knows we have it.

174
00:16:55,493 --> 00:16:57,380
What it was robbed
from a bank or something?

175
00:16:57,477 --> 00:16:59,102
So what?
Banks are insured.

176
00:17:02,434 --> 00:17:03,547
Come on!

177
00:17:04,162 --> 00:17:05,274
What are we gonna do?

178
00:17:05,346 --> 00:17:09,622
You wanna play John Q dipshit
citizen and turn it over to Chicago PD?

179
00:17:09,729 --> 00:17:12,630
Those crooks in blue, you know,
they'll just steal it for themselves anyway.

180
00:17:12,864 --> 00:17:15,862
No, no, baby, no way.
This is our money.

181
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:18,202
Alright?
God sent it to me right out of the sky.

182
00:17:18,271 --> 00:17:21,401
A million car hoods
in Chicago, this suitcase hit mine.

183
00:17:22,237 --> 00:17:23,381
That's fate.

184
00:17:26,876 --> 00:17:29,941
- They would be insured, right?
- Yeah, of course, they would.

185
00:17:30,682 --> 00:17:33,943
Come on, this is our money, baby.
The mortgage is paid up.

186
00:17:34,202 --> 00:17:35,892
You can have all the
stuff, you can finally buy.

187
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:38,674
New furniture, paint the house.

188
00:17:39,704 --> 00:17:40,752
Well ..

189
00:17:41,239 --> 00:17:44,849
Leslie, over $600,000.
Allows us to spend anything we want.

190
00:17:44,918 --> 00:17:46,804
All our dreams come true, baby.

191
00:17:47,605 --> 00:17:48,717
You're right!

192
00:17:49,589 --> 00:17:50,603
My God!

193
00:17:52,819 --> 00:17:54,957
- What first?
- Well, there's a pretty big dent in the car.

194
00:17:55,092 --> 00:17:56,520
- New car!
- Yeah.

195
00:18:17,707 --> 00:18:18,788
What will it be, man?

196
00:18:20,075 --> 00:18:21,285
I'm looking for Zeke.

197
00:18:22,539 --> 00:18:24,742
Wrong joint.
No Zeke here.

198
00:18:26,601 --> 00:18:27,583
Come here.

199
00:18:32,135 --> 00:18:33,117
Come here.

200
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:40,538
Back there.

201
00:18:41,478 --> 00:18:42,458
Thanks.

202
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:27,853
I was told I could buy tools.

203
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,779
I've got tools.

204
00:19:30,902 --> 00:19:32,690
What's your preference?

205
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:35,594
Sears? Stanley?
Snap On?

206
00:19:36,277 --> 00:19:40,531
I was thinking more on the lines of Ruger,
Smith & Wesson, you know?

207
00:20:00,237 --> 00:20:02,756
Can I get me keys to the
Motor Vehicle Department?

208
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:43,286
That's two chairs,
dining room set...

209
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,109
sofa, big screen plasma TV.

210
00:20:46,847 --> 00:20:48,024
What about a bed?

211
00:20:49,118 --> 00:20:50,198
What about a bed?

212
00:20:50,334 --> 00:20:51,578
Bed, bed, bed ...

213
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,367
We definitely got to
have a bed, don't we?

214
00:20:53,468 --> 00:20:55,322
Definitely.
Right this way.

215
00:21:03,546 --> 00:21:04,790
This is perfect.

216
00:21:15,479 --> 00:21:16,852
- Hi.
- Hey!

217
00:21:18,933 --> 00:21:22,510
Okay, they'll deliver our stuff
tomorrow between 1 and 4.

218
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,474
Alright.

219
00:21:24,276 --> 00:21:25,203
Give me that.

220
00:21:27,667 --> 00:21:29,291
Very swanky.

221
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:49,526
Buick.

222
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,844
Kia, maybe.

223
00:23:29,869 --> 00:23:31,046
Can I help you?

224
00:23:33,069 --> 00:23:34,857
Yes, excuse me.
Is that your Toyota?

225
00:23:35,084 --> 00:23:36,513
No, it's my wife's.
Why?

226
00:23:36,652 --> 00:23:39,554
- Who is it Glenn?
- I don't know who the hell he is. Who the hell are you?

227
00:23:40,618 --> 00:23:41,731
Excuse me.

228
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:43,936
Hey motherfucker!

229
00:23:44,585 --> 00:23:46,407
What? You're driving around
you see a nice car...

230
00:23:46,472 --> 00:23:48,992
- you wanna get in my face
and ask me one question?
- What?

231
00:23:49,128 --> 00:23:51,266
It looked like to me
your casing the joint.

232
00:23:51,368 --> 00:23:52,261
Get him, baby.

233
00:23:52,328 --> 00:23:53,942
You better get the fuck out of this
neighborhood before I bust

234
00:23:53,943 --> 00:23:55,556
a cop in your white boy ass.

235
00:23:55,686 --> 00:23:57,594
Coz you don't want this.
He don't want this.

236
00:23:57,669 --> 00:23:59,360
- He don't want this.
-  No, he don't want this.

237
00:23:59,844 --> 00:24:02,528
Listen up,
Glenn the fucking plumber.

238
00:24:02,915 --> 00:24:05,784
You blacks think y'all
so fucking bad.

239
00:24:05,987 --> 00:24:07,394
Well, you aren't.

240
00:24:07,619 --> 00:24:09,723
You think all white
people fear you.

241
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:10,872
We don't.

242
00:24:11,009 --> 00:24:12,765
Now shut your fucking mouth...

243
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:16,089
or I'll put you in the
fucking emergency ward.

244
00:24:16,383 --> 00:24:17,277
Got it?

245
00:24:25,501 --> 00:24:26,711
Did you hear that accent?

246
00:24:26,973 --> 00:24:28,498
Yeah, ain't no regular white boy.

247
00:24:28,571 --> 00:24:30,360
- Come on, let's just go.
- Is he Spanish?

248
00:24:56,467 --> 00:24:57,361
Hi.

249
00:25:00,978 --> 00:25:05,319
Mr. Bearshit Tenderfeet?

250
00:25:05,488 --> 00:25:11,270
No, no, no. Pronounce this way please ...
Bahadurjit Tejinderpreet.

251
00:25:12,462 --> 00:25:13,891
I can helped you, please.

252
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:15,591
Yeah, helped me.

253
00:25:17,805 --> 00:25:19,048
Nice Chevy over there.

254
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:23,490
Oh yeah, my Chevrolet.
Great American automobile.

255
00:25:23,627 --> 00:25:26,528
I like it too much.
Chevrolet.

256
00:25:26,667 --> 00:25:28,357
Big favorite for you, Arabs,
is it?

257
00:25:28,842 --> 00:25:29,736
Arab?

258
00:25:29,898 --> 00:25:32,416
That's bullshit!
I'm Sikh from India!

259
00:25:32,584 --> 00:25:37,634
I don't make no 9/11.
I make 9/9! My beautiful store!

260
00:26:04,256 --> 00:26:06,142
Mr. Melvin Goldberg?

261
00:26:07,422 --> 00:26:08,698
Who wants to know?

262
00:26:08,862 --> 00:26:11,479
- I'm from Bavarian Motor Works.
- The what?

263
00:26:11,612 --> 00:26:14,394
BMW.
Bavarian Motor Works.

264
00:26:15,643 --> 00:26:17,105
Your new car there.

265
00:26:17,403 --> 00:26:18,330
Yeah, well.

266
00:26:19,227 --> 00:26:20,175
So?

267
00:26:20,347 --> 00:26:22,582
I'd like to ask you a couple
of questions, if you don't mind...

268
00:26:22,649 --> 00:26:25,648
- About your new Beemer.
- No, thanks. Beat it.

269
00:26:26,872 --> 00:26:31,148
My company is offering $100
for a simple 5-minute interview.

270
00:26:34,615 --> 00:26:35,562
Yeah.

271
00:26:36,214 --> 00:26:37,141
Come inside.

272
00:26:49,521 --> 00:26:50,415
Yes!

273
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,374
So ...

274
00:26:57,007 --> 00:26:58,316
How long have you had the car?

275
00:26:59,343 --> 00:27:00,269
Eight days.

276
00:27:05,069 --> 00:27:06,345
Do you like the BMW?

277
00:27:06,444 --> 00:27:08,298
Hell, yes.
Don't everybody?

278
00:27:08,491 --> 00:27:12,549
Even those goddamn Mercedes
fools are changing to BMW now.

279
00:27:14,794 --> 00:27:17,248
Aren't you gonna write stuff down?

280
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:19,108
I've got a good memory.

281
00:27:22,151 --> 00:27:24,093
How long, did you say,
you finance the car?

282
00:27:24,551 --> 00:27:25,827
I didn't say.

283
00:27:27,046 --> 00:27:28,573
Why the hell do you
wanna know that anyhow?

284
00:27:29,188 --> 00:27:33,629
Just helps us to determine
buying trends and sort them out.

285
00:27:39,875 --> 00:27:40,823
24 months.

286
00:28:08,154 --> 00:28:09,779
It says you paid cash.

287
00:28:09,913 --> 00:28:10,960
Exit!

288
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,022
Who the hell are you?

289
00:28:12,185 --> 00:28:14,006
Get the fuck out of my house!

290
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:22,483
Sit down.

291
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,595
Fuck you!

292
00:28:25,013 --> 00:28:27,401
Get the hell out
Or I'll throw your ass out.

293
00:29:01,769 --> 00:29:04,965
The suitcase?
Where is the suitcase, Goldberg?

294
00:29:06,663 --> 00:29:08,768
The money.
Where the fuck is it?

295
00:29:12,198 --> 00:29:13,573
I'm sorry, mister.

296
00:29:15,077 --> 00:29:17,181
I'll replace the cash, I promise.

297
00:29:17,509 --> 00:29:18,719
So, it was you?

298
00:29:20,164 --> 00:29:21,658
- Yeah?
- I did it.

299
00:29:22,403 --> 00:29:24,257
But I'll put it back, honest to God.

300
00:29:24,354 --> 00:29:27,419
What do you mean? You spent it all.
You spent half a million?

301
00:29:27,873 --> 00:29:28,766
What?

302
00:29:28,866 --> 00:29:31,547
- No, no ...
- Talk to me Jew motherfucker.

303
00:29:33,088 --> 00:29:34,975
I work for Gen-Am.

304
00:29:35,583 --> 00:29:38,201
I stole the money.
I admit it.

305
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:41,747
But I did, because they
are extorting the customers.

306
00:29:41,853 --> 00:29:44,722
They're rip offs man.
They're chaining the public.

307
00:29:46,589 --> 00:29:48,791
I'll pay it back though, honest.

308
00:29:54,361 --> 00:29:55,768
Was your old car a station wagon?

309
00:29:55,865 --> 00:29:58,417
No way!
You a cop?

310
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,558
If you're fucking lying,
I'll kill you...

311
00:30:04,662 --> 00:30:05,971
and I'll kill you fucking slowly.

312
00:30:06,518 --> 00:30:09,364
I traded a pickup
truck for that BMW.

313
00:30:09,749 --> 00:30:14,122
A 1993 Ford F-150.

314
00:30:14,643 --> 00:30:16,050
Call them, mister.

315
00:30:17,042 --> 00:30:17,936
Yeah.

316
00:30:18,291 --> 00:30:21,801
I stole the money,
but not with a suitcase.

317
00:30:22,961 --> 00:30:24,389
I used a paper bag.

318
00:30:45,226 --> 00:30:46,175
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

319
00:30:46,346 --> 00:30:47,425
You're welcome.
Enjoy.

320
00:30:52,456 --> 00:30:55,684
To the good life and the
fulfillment of our wildest dreams.

321
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:59,197
To my husband may
he ever be so lucky.

322
00:31:16,002 --> 00:31:17,048
Sammy.

323
00:31:19,137 --> 00:31:20,729
We should do that more often.

324
00:31:23,358 --> 00:31:24,787
What got into us?

325
00:31:25,758 --> 00:31:26,903
Cash.

326
00:31:35,291 --> 00:31:36,720
Morning, Mr. Phelan.

327
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:38,584
Good morning, Mrs. Phelan.

328
00:31:38,714 --> 00:31:39,826
Sleep well?

329
00:31:40,794 --> 00:31:42,419
Yes, I did.

330
00:31:43,993 --> 00:31:45,137
Ready for breakfast?

331
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,488
Yeah.

332
00:31:46,615 --> 00:31:47,958
Breakfast too, huh?

333
00:31:48,887 --> 00:31:50,196
Indeed.

334
00:31:50,359 --> 00:31:53,424
Nothing is too good for
Mr. Lucky, Sam Phelan.

335
00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:08,683
- Eat.
- I will.

336
00:32:10,064 --> 00:32:11,405
I'm headed for the shower.

337
00:32:24,172 --> 00:32:25,862
Hi
Mr. Sam Phelan?

338
00:32:25,995 --> 00:32:28,362
Yeah, you're early we weren't
expecting you till noon.

339
00:32:28,491 --> 00:32:30,215
I doubt you are
expecting me at all.

340
00:32:30,315 --> 00:32:32,866
You're the Chunky Chicken
franchise rep, aren't you?

341
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:34,311
No.

342
00:32:35,209 --> 00:32:37,063
Okay, I'm sorry.
I thought...

343
00:32:38,503 --> 00:32:39,780
What can I do for you?

344
00:32:39,912 --> 00:32:41,700
I'd like to talk to you about
your new Range Rover.

345
00:32:41,767 --> 00:32:42,879
I'm from the factory.

346
00:32:42,983 --> 00:32:43,965
Yeah, right.

347
00:32:44,454 --> 00:32:46,974
- It's kind of bad timing.
- It will only take a minute.

348
00:32:48,741 --> 00:32:50,649
Yeah, okay, come on in.
Just a minute though.

349
00:32:50,756 --> 00:32:51,869
Sure.
Thank you.

350
00:32:58,721 --> 00:32:59,615
Take a seat.

351
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,825
I was just about to make
a coffee if you want one.

352
00:33:04,927 --> 00:33:06,072
No thanks.

353
00:33:11,646 --> 00:33:12,855
Looking to invest?

354
00:33:13,437 --> 00:33:15,990
Oh, yeah. My wife and I we want
to start our own business.

355
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,035
Yeah?

356
00:33:18,716 --> 00:33:20,602
Recently consumed cash, did you?

357
00:33:23,546 --> 00:33:26,099
Listen, mister, I don't
have a holding time here so...

358
00:33:27,002 --> 00:33:27,984
Sorry.

359
00:33:28,856 --> 00:33:31,442
So, were you enjoying the Range Rover?

360
00:33:31,576 --> 00:33:33,551
What do you mean, how it handles?
Stuff like that?

361
00:33:33,718 --> 00:33:34,929
It's great, we love it.

362
00:33:36,149 --> 00:33:37,611
How does it compare
to your old car?

363
00:33:37,942 --> 00:33:39,349
That's no comparison.

364
00:33:39,702 --> 00:33:41,042
What was your old car?

365
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:44,334
It's a Buick station wagon.
Piece of crap.

366
00:33:48,082 --> 00:33:50,122
Was it the one with
the wood on the sides?

367
00:33:56,464 --> 00:33:58,503
You said you're from the factory.
What factory?

368
00:34:04,078 --> 00:34:05,092
Hey, listen...

369
00:34:06,413 --> 00:34:07,940
I think you better leave now.

370
00:34:08,044 --> 00:34:08,938
This...

371
00:34:09,932 --> 00:34:11,306
business you want...

372
00:34:13,162 --> 00:34:16,545
you're looking to invest...
What? Half a million...

373
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:17,729
in cash?

374
00:34:17,834 --> 00:34:21,128
Hey, listen, I'm actually expecting somebody,
So, I gotta, I gotta clean up...

375
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:22,434
and I'm gonna have
to ask you to go.

376
00:34:23,304 --> 00:34:24,647
I'm not leaving, Sam.

377
00:34:25,447 --> 00:34:26,789
What do you mean
you're not leaving?

378
00:34:27,431 --> 00:34:30,593
Who the hell do you think you are?
I'll call the police.

379
00:34:55,711 --> 00:34:57,401
Look, we don't smoke in this house.

380
00:35:07,932 --> 00:35:09,425
You have something of mine.

381
00:35:10,778 --> 00:35:12,185
I've never seen you before.

382
00:35:29,684 --> 00:35:30,928
What are you doing?

383
00:35:31,828 --> 00:35:32,721
Please!

384
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:36,999
You can't do that, alright?

385
00:35:38,385 --> 00:35:39,367
Goddamn it!

386
00:35:41,584 --> 00:35:43,047
Stop!
Stop!

387
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,581
What is he doing?
Stop him!

388
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:50,184
No, no, no!
Don't, don't!

389
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:51,403
Okay...

390
00:35:53,836 --> 00:35:54,949
Hang up the phone.

391
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:56,325
Go ahead, hang up.

392
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:08,928
Where is my money?

393
00:36:09,032 --> 00:36:10,276
We have...

394
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:14,243
most of it, that is.
We spent some.

395
00:36:14,566 --> 00:36:15,875
What are you talking about?
We don't have his money.

396
00:36:15,942 --> 00:36:17,981
Save it, Leslie.

397
00:36:20,325 --> 00:36:21,253
I know the truth.

398
00:36:24,324 --> 00:36:25,469
How much did you spend?

399
00:36:28,547 --> 00:36:32,920
- About $70,000, I think.
- Where's the rest?

400
00:36:33,057 --> 00:36:35,063
Some's here and
some's in the bank.

401
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:37,655
- In the bank?
- Several banks, actually.

402
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,319
Avoiding the IRS, huh?

403
00:36:39,902 --> 00:36:40,917
Smart.

404
00:36:41,214 --> 00:36:42,490
Dangerous, though.

405
00:36:44,158 --> 00:36:45,881
Funny how money
corrupts, isn't it?

406
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,354
Okay.

407
00:36:52,412 --> 00:36:53,556
Here's what we gonna do.

408
00:36:54,746 --> 00:36:55,673
Sam...

409
00:36:56,474 --> 00:36:59,156
go get the rest of the cash
left here in the house, okay?

410
00:36:59,482 --> 00:37:00,691
- Well...
- Do it now.

411
00:37:02,904 --> 00:37:03,832
Leslie...

412
00:37:04,568 --> 00:37:05,778
gather up receipts.

413
00:37:06,039 --> 00:37:08,908
You and I, we'll talk about
exactly how much you spent.

414
00:37:09,014 --> 00:37:10,607
You do keep receipts, don't you?

415
00:37:51,562 --> 00:37:56,263
$625,731.

416
00:37:59,175 --> 00:38:00,898
Not a bad hole.

417
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:02,939
Not a bad hole at all.

418
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:08,833
Okay.
It's noon.

419
00:38:08,964 --> 00:38:11,778
Banks need time to gather
up large sums of cash...

420
00:38:11,843 --> 00:38:15,355
So while Leslie is figuring
and I'm counting...

421
00:38:15,842 --> 00:38:19,157
You're going to phone, Sam,
and call everyone of those banks ...

422
00:38:19,329 --> 00:38:20,637
you put my money in...

423
00:38:21,313 --> 00:38:25,305
and tell them you'll be down there today
to pick up that cash. You got it?

424
00:38:31,229 --> 00:38:32,211
What is your total?

425
00:38:35,292 --> 00:38:39,960
$74,316.47.

426
00:38:40,122 --> 00:38:44,660
It's more than the $70,000
that you said, isn't it?

427
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:48,341
I guess I forgot about
some of the other stuff.

428
00:38:49,527 --> 00:38:50,870
That's perfectly natural.

429
00:38:52,023 --> 00:38:53,845
Everything looks so nice too.

430
00:38:54,646 --> 00:38:57,776
That big-screen TV,
the Range Rover.

431
00:38:58,645 --> 00:38:59,789
It looks really good.

432
00:39:01,909 --> 00:39:02,856
Thank you.

433
00:39:03,092 --> 00:39:04,041
So...

434
00:39:05,874 --> 00:39:09,964
So, $625,761 gross...

435
00:39:10,417 --> 00:39:14,540
minus the $ 74,316.47...

436
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:16,199
equals...

437
00:39:17,711 --> 00:39:23,939
$551,414.53.

438
00:39:26,925 --> 00:39:27,852
Correct.

439
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:32,998
$551,414.53...

440
00:39:33,259 --> 00:39:35,080
is the figure we'll
concentrate on.

441
00:39:36,298 --> 00:39:38,272
Gotta get all that house
stunning cash back, right?

442
00:39:40,872 --> 00:39:41,800
Ready, Sam?

443
00:39:44,103 --> 00:39:45,510
I only got through
to a couple of them.

444
00:39:45,895 --> 00:39:47,868
That's okay, we can
call them on the way there.

445
00:39:48,774 --> 00:39:50,333
Let's go visit those banks.

446
00:40:24,763 --> 00:40:25,691
That's good.

447
00:40:26,683 --> 00:40:27,577
Go on.

448
00:40:30,105 --> 00:40:31,217
65, 66 ...

449
00:40:31,737 --> 00:40:32,719
Great.

450
00:40:32,952 --> 00:40:33,846
Next bank.

451
00:40:47,125 --> 00:40:49,197
Well, that was fun, wasn't it?

452
00:40:51,858 --> 00:40:52,807
Leslie...

453
00:40:53,938 --> 00:40:55,367
Go and get your calculator.

454
00:41:11,245 --> 00:41:12,138
Sit down.

455
00:41:18,123 --> 00:41:19,016
Okay.

456
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:23,652
Subtract these figures
from our running total.

457
00:41:24,394 --> 00:41:26,945
$54,557.

458
00:41:29,479 --> 00:41:31,845
$13,660.

459
00:41:33,285 --> 00:41:35,009
$83,000.

460
00:41:36,613 --> 00:41:39,034
$15,236.

461
00:41:40,325 --> 00:41:41,371
What's that leave?

462
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:46,749
$268,184.53.

463
00:41:48,801 --> 00:41:50,176
Where's the rest?

464
00:41:50,912 --> 00:41:52,505
We left some with my mother.

465
00:41:53,376 --> 00:41:54,620
With Mommy.

466
00:41:55,903 --> 00:41:57,758
Who could be safer
than Mommies?

467
00:41:59,614 --> 00:42:01,687
You aren't being busy
little bees, are you?

468
00:42:02,141 --> 00:42:03,767
Good job, I got here when I did.

469
00:42:04,957 --> 00:42:06,134
How much?

470
00:42:06,717 --> 00:42:08,504
$265,000.

471
00:42:10,107 --> 00:42:11,863
We sure trust
Mommy, don't we?

472
00:42:12,155 --> 00:42:20,882
So, U$265,000 subtracted
from our new balance of $268,184.53...

473
00:42:21,623 --> 00:42:25,878
leaves $3184.53.

474
00:42:26,006 --> 00:42:27,250
Where does that go?

475
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:31,791
Low as change, right?

476
00:42:32,501 --> 00:42:36,558
That kind of money goes for candy,
cigarettes, that kind of stuff, right?

477
00:42:36,723 --> 00:42:37,803
We don't smoke.

478
00:42:38,515 --> 00:42:39,498
No?

479
00:42:39,666 --> 00:42:40,615
That's too bad.

480
00:42:49,008 --> 00:42:51,112
You don't mind if I smoke
in the house, do you?

481
00:43:03,946 --> 00:43:05,059
Thank you very much.

482
00:43:07,881 --> 00:43:09,539
Alright,
let's get back to business.

483
00:43:10,248 --> 00:43:18,495
We will add this $3184.53
the  $74,316.47 deficit...

484
00:43:18,631 --> 00:43:21,826
We'll already have less the money
you spent before I got here, right?

485
00:43:22,501 --> 00:43:27,235
That comes to what?
$77,501.

486
00:43:36,512 --> 00:43:37,756
It's been a long day.

487
00:43:38,529 --> 00:43:39,608
I'm hungry.

488
00:43:40,864 --> 00:43:44,092
Leslie, why don't you slip into the
kitchen and cook us up a nice meal?

489
00:43:45,087 --> 00:43:48,566
That way, we don't have to go out anymore.
We'll all stay together.

490
00:43:48,733 --> 00:43:49,878
Isn't that something nice?

491
00:43:56,891 --> 00:43:57,785
Go on.

492
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:19,406
Very good, Leslie.
I liked it.

493
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:21,482
But what was it?

494
00:44:22,291 --> 00:44:24,079
Eggplant, tofu
and veggie steaks.

495
00:44:24,274 --> 00:44:25,452
Veggie steaks?

496
00:44:25,587 --> 00:44:26,764
We don't eat red meat.

497
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:29,932
Why not? Scared to
get mad cow disease?

498
00:44:33,135 --> 00:44:34,029
Alright.

499
00:44:34,992 --> 00:44:37,446
I think I'll go and watch
a little big-screen TV.

500
00:44:38,031 --> 00:44:42,154
Then we all better turn in. Gonna look
brighter now with your granny tomorrow.

501
00:44:42,925 --> 00:44:44,037
You're sleeping with us?

502
00:44:45,004 --> 00:44:46,050
Is that an invitation?

503
00:44:47,787 --> 00:44:48,900
You know what I mean.

504
00:44:49,515 --> 00:44:50,628
Yes, I know.

505
00:44:54,474 --> 00:44:55,553
You can sleep on the couch.

506
00:44:55,881 --> 00:44:56,775
Thanks.

507
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:01,858
What have you got us into?

508
00:45:02,247 --> 00:45:03,588
- Me?
- Yes.

509
00:45:03,911 --> 00:45:05,470
Now you point the finger.

510
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:07,741
That's funny. You didn't mind
spending it yesterday.

511
00:45:09,733 --> 00:45:10,877
I'm calling the police.

512
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:13,405
Put the phone down.

513
00:45:13,859 --> 00:45:15,517
Put the phone...
Give me that!

514
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:17,244
Stop it!
Give it to...!

515
00:45:19,938 --> 00:45:21,181
Look, let's just weigh it out.

516
00:45:21,825 --> 00:45:25,085
Okay, if we call the cops now, they'll
ask questions, lots of questions.

517
00:45:25,279 --> 00:45:27,352
That'd be trouble and we'll
lose what little we have left.

518
00:45:28,767 --> 00:45:32,377
Tomorrow he'll be gone, we still
have all the stuff we bought.

519
00:45:33,405 --> 00:45:35,293
Those are pretty cool stuff.

520
00:45:35,677 --> 00:45:36,570
It's not so bad.

521
00:45:36,669 --> 00:45:38,642
No, that is what I was afraid of.

522
00:45:40,635 --> 00:45:42,641
I wish you never found
that goddamn money.

523
00:45:45,530 --> 00:45:46,805
Let's just go to sleep, okay?

524
00:46:03,476 --> 00:46:05,483
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, honey.

525
00:46:14,130 --> 00:46:16,234
Mom, you know that carton
we left with you?

526
00:46:16,721 --> 00:46:17,832
We need it back.

527
00:46:18,033 --> 00:46:21,163
Honey, you said you needed
it kept safe. I hid it, dear.

528
00:46:21,327 --> 00:46:23,747
That's fine Mom,
but we need it back now.

529
00:46:23,918 --> 00:46:26,884
Really, sweetie, it couldn't
be safer than where it is.

530
00:46:27,022 --> 00:46:28,428
What couldn't be safer?

531
00:46:29,228 --> 00:46:32,163
Well, whatever is in the box, of course.

532
00:46:33,484 --> 00:46:34,411
Go and get it.

533
00:46:35,627 --> 00:46:37,186
Mom, please, go get the box.

534
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,454
Who the hell do you think you are?

535
00:46:45,672 --> 00:46:47,298
I'm one of those people
you'll never meet...

536
00:46:47,367 --> 00:46:49,538
as long as you're a
straight and honest citizen.

537
00:46:49,735 --> 00:46:52,668
Now, what would you have done if we
turned the goddamn money over the police?

538
00:46:53,030 --> 00:46:54,687
But you didn't,
did you, Sam?

539
00:46:55,717 --> 00:46:57,277
So there's no way of ever knowing that.

540
00:47:04,643 --> 00:47:05,918
Hey, come here.

541
00:47:06,114 --> 00:47:07,062
Give it to me.

542
00:47:24,156 --> 00:47:26,131
You took some,
didn't you, Mommy?

543
00:47:27,707 --> 00:47:29,365
- How much did you steal?
- Hey come on, that's enough.

544
00:47:29,466 --> 00:47:31,125
I didn't steal a cent.

545
00:47:33,626 --> 00:47:35,763
- I just borrowed a little.
- Mother.

546
00:47:37,433 --> 00:47:38,610
How much did you borrow?

547
00:47:38,776 --> 00:47:42,222
About $600.
It was a loan!

548
00:47:42,327 --> 00:47:45,392
I needed it! I'm on fixed
income. I was gonna put it back!

549
00:47:45,526 --> 00:47:48,079
Mother, we left that with
you for safekeeping.

550
00:47:48,181 --> 00:47:50,188
I just took a little peek, honey.
There was so much.

551
00:47:50,261 --> 00:47:51,689
It wasn't yours!

552
00:47:51,925 --> 00:47:54,290
Well, it wasn't yours either, was it?

553
00:47:58,577 --> 00:47:59,787
Here's a lesson...

554
00:48:01,617 --> 00:48:04,137
when it comes to cash,
nobody can be trusted.

555
00:48:06,767 --> 00:48:08,044
Like mother, like daughter.

556
00:48:23,947 --> 00:48:25,701
Switch the engine off
and give me the key.

557
00:48:27,785 --> 00:48:28,679
Stay put.

558
00:48:29,704 --> 00:48:30,652
Both of you .

559
00:48:42,438 --> 00:48:43,549
Sam, what are we doing?

560
00:49:06,845 --> 00:49:08,252
Sam, what are we doing?

561
00:49:08,509 --> 00:49:11,061
I don't know, Les, alright. I don't
even know what we should be doing.

562
00:49:11,196 --> 00:49:13,203
Do we even have a right here?
I don't know anymore.

563
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:14,746
Of course we have no right.

564
00:49:14,842 --> 00:49:16,730
He's forcing us to do something
against our will.

565
00:49:16,795 --> 00:49:17,776
Yes, he do, huh.

566
00:49:17,882 --> 00:49:20,880
Coz we are the ones who took the money
you know, we decided to keep it.

567
00:49:21,112 --> 00:49:22,389
We knew it wasn't ours.

568
00:49:24,247 --> 00:49:25,196
Hi, there.

569
00:49:26,167 --> 00:49:27,311
I'm just checking out.

570
00:49:29,846 --> 00:49:31,155
You owe me $58.

571
00:49:31,669 --> 00:49:33,131
We don't give no refund.

572
00:49:34,070 --> 00:49:35,117
What?

573
00:49:37,044 --> 00:49:38,986
No refunds.

574
00:49:40,179 --> 00:49:43,244
I paid you $203 for seven days,
at $29 a day.

575
00:49:44,338 --> 00:49:45,450
I only stayed five days.

576
00:49:45,522 --> 00:49:47,244
You owe me $58 for the
two days I won't be staying.

577
00:49:47,313 --> 00:49:48,742
What, you got shit
in your ears, mister?

578
00:49:48,816 --> 00:49:51,151
I said no goddamn refund!

579
00:49:51,279 --> 00:49:53,646
Now get on down the road
before I call the cops.

580
00:50:04,717 --> 00:50:08,424
Next, I'll break your arms, your leg...

581
00:50:09,674 --> 00:50:11,016
and finally your neck.

582
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:16,104
Now...

583
00:50:18,313 --> 00:50:19,970
just count all the
money you owe me...

584
00:50:20,775 --> 00:50:21,919
and hand it over.

585
00:50:32,995 --> 00:50:34,368
Maybe forgetting something.

586
00:50:34,979 --> 00:50:37,595
What?
You want a receipt?

587
00:50:38,401 --> 00:50:40,223
My day.
What about my day?

588
00:50:42,976 --> 00:50:44,252
Have a nice day?

589
00:50:44,447 --> 00:50:45,908
Good.
I will.

590
00:50:46,718 --> 00:50:48,790
- Thank you.
- Same to you.

591
00:50:55,772 --> 00:50:56,666
Okay.

592
00:50:57,179 --> 00:50:58,073
Let's go.

593
00:50:58,587 --> 00:50:59,481
Leslie?

594
00:51:08,792 --> 00:51:09,686
Okay...

595
00:51:11,928 --> 00:51:13,203
I need to go back out.

596
00:51:19,477 --> 00:51:21,168
But I need you both
to stay in the house.

597
00:51:26,228 --> 00:51:27,404
Can I trust you to do that?

598
00:51:29,714 --> 00:51:30,607
Yes.

599
00:51:34,385 --> 00:51:35,792
Did you see the blood on his shirt?

600
00:51:36,208 --> 00:51:38,728
He took out a guy
in that motel today.

601
00:51:39,055 --> 00:51:41,738
He's crazy.
We gotta call the police.

602
00:51:41,870 --> 00:51:43,363
We should have called it yesterday.

603
00:51:44,174 --> 00:51:46,726
We can do it tonight
after he's asleep.

604
00:51:49,004 --> 00:51:49,898
I found them.

605
00:51:50,604 --> 00:51:52,360
How fucking nice work, bro.

606
00:51:53,324 --> 00:51:57,119
I recovered $547,433.

607
00:51:57,609 --> 00:52:00,675
That's fucking brilliant, Pyke.
Fuck me!

608
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:02,909
There's more of it.

609
00:52:03,081 --> 00:52:04,192
Really? How much?

610
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:08,669
- Some $78,298 still outstanding.
- Where is it?

611
00:52:09,382 --> 00:52:10,396
They spent it.

612
00:52:10,566 --> 00:52:13,150
That's okay, fuck you.
We still got $250k a piece, right?

613
00:52:13,285 --> 00:52:15,292
No.
I'm going after the rest.

614
00:52:15,492 --> 00:52:16,539
What do you mean?

615
00:52:19,715 --> 00:52:21,623
Come on, bro.
Give me a fucking break!

616
00:52:22,019 --> 00:52:23,545
Please, just this once.

617
00:52:24,066 --> 00:52:26,520
- They spent it, bro, it's gone.
- It's not gone.

618
00:52:27,041 --> 00:52:28,502
It's just be misplaced.

619
00:52:29,632 --> 00:52:30,941
I'll get it replaced.

620
00:52:32,671 --> 00:52:33,598
Okay.

621
00:52:35,326 --> 00:52:36,700
Have it your fucking way.

622
00:52:37,949 --> 00:52:38,964
As usual.

623
00:52:39,293 --> 00:52:40,538
Do what you fucking like.

624
00:52:43,037 --> 00:52:45,305
I'll see you when I
get out of this shithole.

625
00:53:01,431 --> 00:53:03,764
Let's talk about the rest
of the money you owe.

626
00:53:03,989 --> 00:53:05,168
What are you talking about?

627
00:53:11,890 --> 00:53:14,890
What are you talking about?
We spent the rest, right, it's gone.

628
00:53:15,443 --> 00:53:16,936
And now we have to get it back.

629
00:53:18,385 --> 00:53:23,883
The outstanding deficit is $78,298.

630
00:53:24,335 --> 00:53:25,318
What?

631
00:53:30,733 --> 00:53:33,732
Why don't you just take the Range Rover,
take the new furniture, take it all?

632
00:53:33,868 --> 00:53:35,078
I don't want your goods, Sam.

633
00:53:36,044 --> 00:53:37,288
I'm not a merchant.

634
00:53:38,156 --> 00:53:40,707
I'm more like a banker.
I require cash.

635
00:53:41,834 --> 00:53:44,321
We don't have $78,000l!

636
00:53:44,458 --> 00:53:46,661
$78,298.

637
00:53:46,761 --> 00:53:48,517
We don't have that, either.

638
00:53:50,119 --> 00:53:52,223
You know what?
Can't you just leave?

639
00:53:52,359 --> 00:53:54,300
You have $500,000 plus.

640
00:53:54,599 --> 00:53:56,289
Just leave us alone!

641
00:53:56,837 --> 00:53:58,494
We're sorry we spent some.

642
00:53:58,629 --> 00:54:01,378
We felt God smiled down on us.
We were wrong.

643
00:54:01,508 --> 00:54:02,653
We're sorry.

644
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:06,589
Nothing is free, Leslie.

645
00:54:07,874 --> 00:54:09,020
Not in this life.

646
00:54:10,881 --> 00:54:12,669
You knew that money
wasn't yours.

647
00:54:13,601 --> 00:54:14,615
And you spent it.

648
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:17,247
Now you have to pay.

649
00:54:21,406 --> 00:54:22,748
What are you gonna do?

650
00:54:23,933 --> 00:54:24,980
Kill us?

651
00:54:25,374 --> 00:54:26,715
We don't have it!

652
00:54:27,324 --> 00:54:29,299
Let's not discuss
consequences.

653
00:54:30,748 --> 00:54:34,390
Let just focus on how you're
gonna get my money back.

654
00:54:43,063 --> 00:54:44,405
Good food, Leslie.

655
00:54:45,367 --> 00:54:47,669
Better if it was meat,
but good all the same.

656
00:54:48,854 --> 00:54:49,966
Sam cooked it.

657
00:54:51,349 --> 00:54:52,941
Real domestic, yeah, Sam?
