<i>I will be truthful and mention
that before our rigid search...</i>

2
00:01:59,691 --> 00:02:04,492
<i>... i had the opinion jewish people
were having shit between their brains.</i>

3
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:08,397
<i>Primarily, this is because all i knew
of jewish people...</i>

4
00:02:08,566 --> 00:02:11,660
<i>... was that they paid father
very much currency...</i>

5
00:02:11,836 --> 00:02:16,899
<i>... in order to make vacations
from america to ukraine.</i>

6
00:02:20,211 --> 00:02:23,874
<i>I was of the opinion
that the past is past...</i>

7
00:02:24,782 --> 00:02:29,048
<i>... and like all that is not now,
it should remain buried...</i>

8
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,848
<i>... along the side of our memories.</i>

9
00:02:36,861 --> 00:02:41,457
<i>But this was before the commencement
of our very rigid search.</i>

10
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,560
<i>Before i encountered the collector...</i>

11
00:02:46,638 --> 00:02:48,697
<i>... jonathan safran foer.</i>

12
00:05:04,809 --> 00:05:08,836
Your grandfather wanted you
to have this...

13
00:05:10,314 --> 00:05:12,111
...for your collection.

14
00:05:47,351 --> 00:05:49,148
Who is augustine?

15
00:05:58,496 --> 00:05:59,724
Grandma?

16
00:10:30,267 --> 00:10:31,757
Where did you get that hat?

17
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:33,759
Alex gave it to me.

18
00:10:35,973 --> 00:10:36,997
Take it off.

19
00:10:37,641 --> 00:10:38,630
Why?

20
00:10:38,809 --> 00:10:41,243
Because i told you to, that's why.

21
00:10:41,412 --> 00:10:42,674
I think he looks cool.

22
00:10:42,847 --> 00:10:44,337
Who asked you to speak?

23
00:10:44,515 --> 00:10:46,483
Did i ask you to speak?

24
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:47,810
Did mama ask you to speak?

25
00:10:47,985 --> 00:10:49,179
Did grandfather ask you to speak?

26
00:10:50,454 --> 00:10:51,580
Shut up!

27
00:10:52,189 --> 00:10:54,157
Don't talk to her like that!

28
00:10:54,658 --> 00:10:57,456
Papa, i already have one son
walking around odessa...

29
00:10:57,628 --> 00:11:00,028
...looking like a raving lunatic.

30
00:11:01,432 --> 00:11:03,093
I don't need another.

31
00:11:03,267 --> 00:11:04,165
But papa...

32
00:11:06,704 --> 00:11:11,004
<i>my legal name is alexander perchov,
but all of my friends dub me alex...</i>

33
00:11:11,175 --> 00:11:13,837
<i>... because this is much more flaccid
to utter.</i>

34
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:18,242
<i>That is father retrieving his fist
from the right side of my face.</i>

35
00:11:18,415 --> 00:11:21,179
<i>Father is a first-rate puncher.</i>

36
00:11:21,719 --> 00:11:23,949
<i>This is my miniature brother, igor.</i>

37
00:11:24,121 --> 00:11:26,749
<i>I am tutoring him to be a man
of this world.</i>

38
00:11:26,924 --> 00:11:30,985
<i>For an example, i exhibited him
a smutty magazine three days yore.</i>

39
00:11:31,395 --> 00:11:33,556
Why is it called sixty-nine?

40
00:11:33,731 --> 00:11:37,531
<i>I explain it to him that this is
because it was invented in the year 1969.</i>

41
00:11:37,701 --> 00:11:41,501
<i>I know this because my friend grisha knows
a friend of the nephew of the inventor.</i>

42
00:11:41,672 --> 00:11:45,665
What did people do before 1969?

43
00:11:47,678 --> 00:11:50,272
<i>He is a genius, my miniature brother.</i>

44
00:11:50,447 --> 00:11:55,077
<i>He will be made a vip
if i have a thing to do with it.</i>

45
00:11:55,419 --> 00:12:00,254
<i>This is grandfather. Like my father
and myself, he too is dubbed alex.</i>

46
00:12:00,724 --> 00:12:04,717
<i>My grandmother, anna, died two years
before of a cancer in her brain.</i>

47
00:12:04,895 --> 00:12:08,194
<i>Precluding this,
grandfather became very melancholy...</i>

48
00:12:08,365 --> 00:12:11,391
<i>... and also, he says, blind.</i>

49
00:12:12,102 --> 00:12:14,900
<i>His most recent employment
was heritage tours...</i>

50
00:12:15,072 --> 00:12:17,233
<i>... a business he started in 1950s...</i>

51
00:12:17,408 --> 00:12:20,900
<i>... mostly for aiding rich jewish people
to search for their dead families.</i>

52
00:12:21,445 --> 00:12:23,811
<i>It is a strange employment
for grandfather...</i>

53
00:12:23,981 --> 00:12:29,419
<i>... as there is nothing he hates more than
rich jewish people or their dead families.</i>

54
00:12:29,587 --> 00:12:32,283
<i>This is sammy davis jr. Jr.</i>

55
00:12:32,456 --> 00:12:35,289
<i>She is grandfather's seeing eye bitch.</i>

56
00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:39,361
<i>Father purchased her for him not
because he believes grandfather is blind...</i>

57
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:42,397
<i>... but because a seeing eye bitch
is also a good thing...</i>

58
00:12:42,566 --> 00:12:45,694
<i>... for people who pine for
the opposite of loneliness.</i>

59
00:12:48,305 --> 00:12:51,797
<i>In truth,
father did not purchase her at all...</i>

60
00:12:51,976 --> 00:12:55,912
<i>... but merely retrieved her
from the home for forgetful dogs.</i>

61
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,015
<i>Because of this,
she is not a real seeing eye bitch...</i>

62
00:12:59,183 --> 00:13:01,845
<i>... and is also mentally deranged.</i>

63
00:13:02,486 --> 00:13:06,320
<i>Most of all, she relishes when i sing to her
her most beloved song...</i>

64
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:09,857
<i>..."billie jean" by michael jackson.</i>

65
00:13:12,663 --> 00:13:15,325
<i>But now i must tell you more of myself.</i>

66
00:13:15,499 --> 00:13:20,163
<i>I am unequivocally tall. I do not know
any women who are taller than me.</i>

67
00:13:20,337 --> 00:13:23,329
<i>The women who are taller than me
are lesbians...</i>

68
00:13:23,507 --> 00:13:27,136
<i>... for whom 1969
was a very momentous year.</i>

69
00:13:27,478 --> 00:13:29,969
<i>For me, america is a first-rate place.</i>

70
00:13:30,147 --> 00:13:31,136
Kangol!!

71
00:13:31,315 --> 00:13:34,478
<i>Most of all, i am beloved
of american movies, muscular cars...</i>

72
00:13:34,652 --> 00:13:36,483
<i>... and hip-hop music.</i>

73
00:13:38,789 --> 00:13:42,122
<i>I also dig negroes.
Most of all, michael jackson.</i>

74
00:13:42,793 --> 00:13:46,126
<i>He is a first-rate dancer, just like me.</i>

75
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:58,107
<i>Many girls want to be carnal with me
because i'm such a premium dancer.</i>

76
00:14:40,184 --> 00:14:42,414
You're taking a jew
to lutsk this weekend.

77
00:14:42,586 --> 00:14:44,816
- I can't, i have plans.
- What plans?

78
00:14:44,988 --> 00:14:46,853
With grisha at club zephyr.

79
00:14:47,024 --> 00:14:50,152
Well, now you're taking
a jew to lutsk.

80
00:14:50,327 --> 00:14:52,318
But we have vip passes.

81
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:02,038
Papa, i need you to drive them.

82
00:15:02,206 --> 00:15:04,538
Go to hell!
I'm not driving anyone.

83
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:09,042
Papa,
they are paying $ 1200 american.

84
00:15:09,213 --> 00:15:14,549
I don't care. I'm retired.
No more dead jews.

85
00:15:14,718 --> 00:15:17,482
Papa, you drive him to this place...

86
00:15:17,654 --> 00:15:21,385
...show him everyone is dead
and you come home.

87
00:15:21,558 --> 00:15:22,820
It will be so simple.

88
00:15:22,993 --> 00:15:26,724
He's looking for a woman
who saved his grandfather from the nazis.

89
00:15:26,897 --> 00:15:30,458
Trust me,
there is no one there anymore.

90
00:15:30,634 --> 00:15:32,932
She is from someplace called...

91
00:15:33,103 --> 00:15:35,230
...trachimbrod.

92
00:15:35,406 --> 00:15:38,569
It's near lutsk.
They said he has a map.

93
00:15:39,143 --> 00:15:43,603
His name is jonathan s. Foer.
He is a writer.

94
00:15:43,781 --> 00:15:46,375
He wants to write a book
about the place.

95
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:48,643
Okay, i'll go.

96
00:15:49,286 --> 00:15:51,754
But sammy goes too.

97
00:15:51,989 --> 00:15:55,948
Papa, please,
you know that is impossible.

98
00:15:56,126 --> 00:15:57,150
She's demented!

99
00:15:59,062 --> 00:16:00,927
You listen to me.

100
00:16:01,098 --> 00:16:02,793
I'm supposed to be retired.

101
00:16:02,966 --> 00:16:05,594
I am not supposed to
be dragging rich jews...

102
00:16:05,769 --> 00:16:08,431
...all over the goddamn country.

103
00:16:08,605 --> 00:16:10,835
I'm blind. Blind!
Understand?

104
00:16:11,508 --> 00:16:14,705
My bitch is my eyes.
I'm not going anywhere without her.

105
00:16:14,878 --> 00:16:18,006
Papa, i'm not saying
that i don't believe you're blind...

106
00:16:18,182 --> 00:16:20,150
...but the american could have
a problem with this.

107
00:16:20,317 --> 00:16:23,445
No bitch, no driver.

108
00:16:24,655 --> 00:16:27,283
We could make a uniform for her...

109
00:16:29,326 --> 00:16:31,726
...to make her seem more official.

110
00:20:26,897 --> 00:20:28,159
Are you jonfen?

111
00:20:28,999 --> 00:20:29,988
What?

112
00:20:30,167 --> 00:20:32,158
Jonfen. Are you jonfen?

113
00:20:32,803 --> 00:20:34,065
It's jonathan.

114
00:20:34,571 --> 00:20:35,663
What?

115
00:20:36,006 --> 00:20:38,975
My name. It's jonathan.

116
00:20:41,144 --> 00:20:42,338
Jonfen.

117
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:47,383
Are you my translator?

118
00:20:47,551 --> 00:20:51,248
Yes, i'm alexander perchov.
I'll be your humble translator.

119
00:20:58,462 --> 00:21:01,124
I implore you to forgive my speaking
of english, jonfen...

120
00:21:01,298 --> 00:21:03,528
...as i'm not so premium with it.

121
00:21:05,869 --> 00:21:07,803
My name is jonathan.

122
00:21:24,955 --> 00:21:29,051
This is our driver.
He is an expert at driving.

123
00:21:31,128 --> 00:21:33,392
- Is he all right?
- What?

124
00:21:33,563 --> 00:21:35,326
I mean, you know, is he healthy?

125
00:21:35,499 --> 00:21:38,696
Of course. He's my grandfather.

126
00:21:42,205 --> 00:21:46,301
Please, do not be distressed.
This is only driver's seeing eye bitch.

127
00:21:47,911 --> 00:21:50,812
Okay, she's deranged, but so, so playful.

128
00:21:51,248 --> 00:21:52,442
Wait, he's blind?

129
00:21:52,749 --> 00:21:56,742
No, only he thinks this.
Please, do not be distressed.

130
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,146
Grandfather!

131
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:03,223
Grandfather, i've got jonfen.
We should go to lutsk.

132
00:22:06,763 --> 00:22:07,752
Yes?

133
00:22:08,832 --> 00:22:10,322
Are you sure he's okay?

134
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,161
- Grandfather!
- Shut up!

135
00:22:12,335 --> 00:22:14,860
I'm blind, not deaf.
I heard you the first time!

136
00:22:15,038 --> 00:22:17,006
What does he say?

137
00:22:17,574 --> 00:22:19,838
He says, "okey-dokey, we will go now."

138
00:22:20,844 --> 00:22:23,369
- Where will the dog be?
- What do you mean?

139
00:22:24,047 --> 00:22:26,106
I have a phobia.

140
00:22:28,051 --> 00:22:30,019
A fear.

141
00:22:31,955 --> 00:22:33,820
I'm distressed by dogs.

142
00:22:36,193 --> 00:22:37,421
He is afraid of dogs.

143
00:22:37,594 --> 00:22:39,562
Bullshit,
no one is afraid of dogs.

144
00:22:41,131 --> 00:22:43,531
Grandfather informs me
this is not possible.

145
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,724
What?

146
00:22:44,901 --> 00:22:46,732
Get in the car.

147
00:22:46,903 --> 00:22:49,235
The bitch and the jew
will share the back seat.

148
00:22:49,406 --> 00:22:50,896
It is big enough for both of them.

149
00:22:51,074 --> 00:22:53,872
No, wait. Wait.
You don't understand.

150
00:22:54,044 --> 00:22:57,878
I have a very serious, serious problem
with dogs.

151
00:22:58,048 --> 00:23:00,482
I can't sit in there. You...

152
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:57,870
were you able to manufacture the:

153
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:01,807
- What?
- The z's.

154
00:24:01,978 --> 00:24:03,741
Were you able to make the:

155
00:24:04,447 --> 00:24:06,881
- I don't understand.
- Repose.

156
00:24:08,318 --> 00:24:10,377
Did you repose?

157
00:24:10,553 --> 00:24:12,783
Yeah, i reposed.

158
00:24:12,956 --> 00:24:17,586
Good. Sammy davis jr. Jr.
Is also in repose.

159
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:22,462
- Why do you call her that?
- What?

160
00:24:22,632 --> 00:24:24,600
Sammy davis jr. Jr.

161
00:24:24,768 --> 00:24:29,569
Because sammy davis jr.
Was grandfather's most beloved singer.

162
00:24:29,739 --> 00:24:32,537
You know, the candy man.
The negro from the rat pack.

163
00:24:32,709 --> 00:24:34,404
- And a jew.
- What?

164
00:24:34,577 --> 00:24:37,011
Yeah, he was a jew.
You didn't know that?

165
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:40,344
Grandfather, the jew says that
sammy davis jr. Is jewish.

166
00:24:40,517 --> 00:24:41,916
The bitch?

167
00:24:42,085 --> 00:24:44,280
Not jr. Jr., jr. The singer.

168
00:24:44,454 --> 00:24:46,479
That's bullshit!

169
00:24:47,891 --> 00:24:50,917
Grandfather informs me
that this is not possible.

170
00:24:51,094 --> 00:24:55,394
Of course it is. He converted. He's the most
famous black jew in america.

171
00:24:56,099 --> 00:24:59,330
- Please tell me, is the shaq also the jew?
- Who?

172
00:24:59,502 --> 00:25:02,699
- Shaquille o'neal, the los angeles laker.
- No.

173
00:25:02,872 --> 00:25:06,273
- And michael jackson?
- No, definitely not a jew.

174
00:25:47,283 --> 00:25:51,913
Father informs me you are writing a book
about this trip. You are a writer?

175
00:25:52,589 --> 00:25:53,749
No.

176
00:25:55,291 --> 00:25:56,519
Then what is this?

177
00:25:57,293 --> 00:25:58,726
It's a catalog.

178
00:25:59,429 --> 00:26:00,919
Catalog.

179
00:26:02,599 --> 00:26:04,066
Catalog.

180
00:26:04,901 --> 00:26:06,960
I don't know why they told you that.

181
00:26:07,904 --> 00:26:09,462
I'm not a writer.

182
00:26:09,639 --> 00:26:12,802
I mean, i write, but i'm more of...

183
00:26:14,177 --> 00:26:16,077
...a collector, really.

184
00:26:16,846 --> 00:26:18,507
And what do you collect?

185
00:26:19,616 --> 00:26:20,947
Things.

186
00:26:23,787 --> 00:26:25,311
Family things.

187
00:26:26,022 --> 00:26:27,751
It is a good career, yes?

188
00:26:28,658 --> 00:26:31,422
No, it's not a career.
It's just something i do.

189
00:26:31,861 --> 00:26:32,919
Why?

190
00:26:33,997 --> 00:26:38,764
I don't know. Why does anybody
do anything? It's just something to do.

191
00:26:40,336 --> 00:26:41,928
I understand.

192
00:26:45,809 --> 00:26:47,470
I also enjoy writing...

193
00:26:48,044 --> 00:26:51,309
...but i truly feel i was born
to be accountant.

194
00:27:14,504 --> 00:27:15,994
Are we close?

195
00:27:16,172 --> 00:27:17,901
The jew wants to know
if we are close.

196
00:27:18,074 --> 00:27:20,804
Tell him to shut the hell up!

197
00:27:21,544 --> 00:27:23,978
Grandfather says we're very proximal.

198
00:27:24,147 --> 00:27:27,378
He says it will not be long
until we get to the superway to lutsk.

199
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:28,710
And from there?

200
00:27:28,885 --> 00:27:30,250
How long from here to lutsk?

201
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:33,321
Perhaps you would like me
to stop the car...

202
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:35,981
...and you two can
fuck yourselves to lutsk!

203
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:37,353
What did he say?

204
00:27:37,527 --> 00:27:41,486
Grandfather says you should look out
the window at the premium countryside.

205
00:28:05,755 --> 00:28:07,848
- Are you hungry?
- Yes.

206
00:28:08,024 --> 00:28:11,357
- I just hope they have something i can eat.
- What do you mean?

207
00:28:11,528 --> 00:28:13,120
I'm a vegetarian.

208
00:28:13,897 --> 00:28:15,125
You're a what?

209
00:28:15,298 --> 00:28:16,663
I don't eat meat.

210
00:28:17,433 --> 00:28:19,025
How can you not eat meat?

211
00:28:20,203 --> 00:28:22,330
I just don't.

212
00:28:24,707 --> 00:28:26,732
He says he does not eat meat.

213
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:28,002
What?

214
00:28:29,946 --> 00:28:32,380
- No meat?
- No meat.

215
00:28:32,549 --> 00:28:34,039
- Steak?
- No.

216
00:28:34,217 --> 00:28:35,241
- Chickens?
- No.

217
00:28:36,252 --> 00:28:37,651
And what about the sausage?

218
00:28:37,987 --> 00:28:40,922
No, no sausage. No meat.

219
00:28:42,258 --> 00:28:44,055
He says he does not eat any meat.

220
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,757
Not even sausage?

221
00:28:45,929 --> 00:28:47,089
I know.

222
00:28:47,263 --> 00:28:49,322
What is wrong with him?

223
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,393
What is wrong with you?

224
00:28:53,269 --> 00:28:55,601
Nothing. I just don't eat meat.

225
00:29:02,679 --> 00:29:04,010
Hello.

226
00:29:05,248 --> 00:29:09,514
Excuse me,
do you have anything without meat?

227
00:29:09,686 --> 00:29:10,744
Why?

228
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,354
Our friend here is american...

229
00:29:13,523 --> 00:29:14,888
i can see that.

230
00:29:15,058 --> 00:29:18,084
Yes, of course,
but he does not eat meat.

231
00:29:19,095 --> 00:29:20,289
What is wrong with him?

232
00:29:20,463 --> 00:29:21,760
What did she say?

233
00:29:22,198 --> 00:29:25,759
She says they do not have anything
without meat.

234
00:29:26,536 --> 00:29:29,164
Don't they have potatoes or something?

235
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:31,529
Potatoes?

236
00:29:31,708 --> 00:29:33,437
You only get
potato with the meat.

237
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:36,010
The potatoes come only with the meat.

238
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:40,208
But can't i have a potato
on a plate by itself?

239
00:29:41,317 --> 00:29:45,310
Please, this american is deranged.

240
00:29:45,488 --> 00:29:47,615
Would it be possible to have
a potato without the meat?

241
00:31:08,237 --> 00:31:10,228
Welcome to ukraine.

242
00:32:02,392 --> 00:32:05,850
- And these are your family?
- Yeah.

243
00:32:09,432 --> 00:32:11,127
My grandmother gave me this.

244
00:32:11,434 --> 00:32:14,733
That's my grandfather, safran.
It was taken during the war.

245
00:32:16,139 --> 00:32:17,629
It's you.

246
00:32:17,807 --> 00:32:19,297
I've heard that.

247
00:32:19,475 --> 00:32:22,103
- And this is augustine?
- Yeah.

248
00:32:22,678 --> 00:32:26,910
My mother said that he never would have
made it to america if it weren't for her.

249
00:32:27,116 --> 00:32:28,708
And she's from trachimbrod?

250
00:32:28,885 --> 00:32:30,785
Or somewhere near there.

251
00:32:31,154 --> 00:32:33,588
This is kolki. My grandmother's shtetl.

252
00:32:33,756 --> 00:32:34,882
"Shtetl"?

253
00:32:35,057 --> 00:32:36,251
It's a village.

254
00:32:36,426 --> 00:32:40,362
It's yiddish, it means "village."
It doesn't seem to be far from trachimbrod.

255
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:43,988
That's why i was thinking
it might be called sofiewka now.

256
00:32:46,836 --> 00:32:49,498
Why do you make such a rigid search?

257
00:32:52,608 --> 00:32:56,203
I guess i just wanted to see
where my grandfather grew up...

258
00:32:57,447 --> 00:33:00,314
...where i would be now
if he hadn't come to america.

259
00:33:00,483 --> 00:33:02,713
You would be ukrainian, like me.

260
00:33:02,885 --> 00:33:06,844
Only not like me, because you would be
a farmer from some unimpressive town...

261
00:33:07,156 --> 00:33:11,024
...and i am from odessa.
- I see.

262
00:33:12,328 --> 00:33:14,888
And did your grandparents ever return
to ukraine?

263
00:33:15,064 --> 00:33:18,500
God, no. My grandmother would go crazy
if she knew i was here.

264
00:33:18,668 --> 00:33:20,135
Why?

265
00:33:20,436 --> 00:33:21,835
She didn't think it was safe.

266
00:33:22,004 --> 00:33:25,838
She said that before the war,
ukraine was just as bad as berlin.

267
00:33:26,542 --> 00:33:29,136
Jews weren't exactly popular in ukraine.

268
00:33:29,312 --> 00:33:32,748
When the nazis invaded, she actually
thought it would be an improvement.

269
00:33:33,216 --> 00:33:34,843
Who told you this?

270
00:33:36,886 --> 00:33:38,285
My grandmother.

271
00:33:38,721 --> 00:33:40,621
Why did she say this?

272
00:33:42,859 --> 00:33:44,884
I don't know. It's just how she felt.

273
00:33:48,231 --> 00:33:49,323
Grandfather...

274
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:53,057
...he says ukrainians were
anti-semitic before the war.

275
00:33:53,736 --> 00:33:55,033
Is it true?

276
00:33:58,174 --> 00:33:59,402
Grandfather?

277
00:34:14,524 --> 00:34:15,991
It's nice.

278
00:34:19,128 --> 00:34:21,255
Really, it's just for sleeping.

279
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:32,503
- Jonfen?
- Yeah.

280
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:37,408
You were very proximal
with your grandfather, yes?

281
00:34:41,784 --> 00:34:44,048
Yeah. Why?

282
00:34:45,922 --> 00:34:47,913
Tomorrow we will make a search.

283
00:34:48,324 --> 00:34:49,621
Good night.

284
00:34:49,792 --> 00:34:51,054
Good night.

285
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,830
Make sure to secure the door
when i am gone.

286
00:35:00,002 --> 00:35:02,232
I do not want
to make you petrified person...

287
00:35:02,405 --> 00:35:06,102
...but there are many dangerous people
who want to take things from americans...

288
00:35:06,275 --> 00:35:08,800
...and also kidnap them. Okay?

289
00:35:09,745 --> 00:35:10,734
Okay.

290
00:35:10,913 --> 00:35:12,175
Good night.

291
00:35:21,991 --> 00:35:24,152
Sammy davis jr. Jr.

292
00:35:24,961 --> 00:35:26,292
Come on, let's go.

293
00:36:18,047 --> 00:36:21,676
He seems like a good person.

294
00:36:22,618 --> 00:36:24,279
Yes, he does.

295
00:36:25,454 --> 00:36:28,617
We should try to help him.

296
00:36:29,158 --> 00:36:30,352
How?

297
00:36:32,328 --> 00:36:35,661
We should try to find her.

298
00:36:36,198 --> 00:36:37,358
Who?

299
00:36:39,301 --> 00:36:40,666
Augustine.

300
00:38:36,585 --> 00:38:39,315
- What is it?
- Soviets.

301
00:38:40,288 --> 00:38:41,915
What happened?

302
00:38:43,792 --> 00:38:45,316
Independence.

303
00:39:02,477 --> 00:39:03,705
Look.

304
00:39:19,995 --> 00:39:21,622
We are looking for trachimbrod.

305
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:23,529
Do you know it?

306
00:39:23,699 --> 00:39:25,633
You heard of trachimbrod?

307
00:39:27,069 --> 00:39:29,003
Never heard of it!

308
00:39:29,171 --> 00:39:30,502
Come here, please!

309
00:39:30,672 --> 00:39:31,832
Come here!

310
00:39:37,145 --> 00:39:39,045
It's a small village...

311
00:39:39,214 --> 00:39:40,545
...trachimbrod.

312
00:39:40,716 --> 00:39:44,413
Mention the other names to him.
Perhaps one will sound informal.

313
00:39:44,586 --> 00:39:47,384
Kovel', kivertsy, sokirentsy.

314
00:39:47,556 --> 00:39:49,387
Maybe kolki?

315
00:39:50,092 --> 00:39:51,081
Yes, yes.

316
00:39:51,259 --> 00:39:53,056
Could you direct us to them?

317
00:39:53,228 --> 00:39:55,492
Of course.
They are not so far.

318
00:39:55,664 --> 00:39:57,427
Go north on the superway.

319
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,592
Keep going north...

320
00:40:00,235 --> 00:40:02,430
...until you see wheat fields...

321
00:40:03,405 --> 00:40:07,501
...then head east
through the farmlands.

322
00:40:07,676 --> 00:40:09,007
Thank you.

323
00:40:09,377 --> 00:40:11,345
Here. Thank you.

324
00:40:13,115 --> 00:40:15,413
- What is he doing?
- What is he doing?

325
00:40:15,584 --> 00:40:17,518
- What are you doing?
- For helping us.

326
00:40:17,686 --> 00:40:19,278
- What?
- I read in my guidebook...

327
00:40:19,454 --> 00:40:21,581
...you can't find
marlboro cigarettes here...

328
00:40:21,757 --> 00:40:23,952
...so you should take them everywhere
as tips.

329
00:40:24,126 --> 00:40:25,923
He doesn't eat meat.

330
00:40:29,264 --> 00:40:30,697
Thank you.

331
00:40:38,273 --> 00:40:39,433
What is "tips"?

332
00:40:39,608 --> 00:40:43,442
Tips are something you give someone
in exchange for help.

333
00:40:43,612 --> 00:40:46,877
You are informed you will be paying
for this trip with currency, yes?

334
00:40:47,048 --> 00:40:51,382
No, not like that. Tips are for small things,
like directions or the valet.

335
00:40:51,553 --> 00:40:54,113
- Valet?
- You know, the guy who parks your car.

336
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:56,655
Why do you not park your own car?

337
00:41:17,612 --> 00:41:21,343
How much currency would
a first-rate accountant receive in america?

338
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:25,742
I don't know.
A lot, probably, if he or she is good.

339
00:41:25,921 --> 00:41:27,183
She?

340
00:41:27,355 --> 00:41:28,515
Or he.

341
00:41:29,658 --> 00:41:31,353
Are there negro accountants?

342
00:41:33,094 --> 00:41:35,995
Yes, there are african-american
accountants...

343
00:41:36,164 --> 00:41:39,930
...but you don't want to use that word.
- And homosexual accountants?

344
00:41:40,302 --> 00:41:43,669
There are homosexual everythings.
There are homosexual garbage men.

345
00:41:46,474 --> 00:41:50,001
And how much currency would
negro homosexual accountant receive?

346
00:41:50,178 --> 00:41:51,702
You shouldn't use that word.

347
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,541
- Which word?
- The n-word.

348
00:41:53,715 --> 00:41:56,650
- It's not the n-word, but...
- negro?

349
00:41:57,152 --> 00:41:58,619
Yeah, that one.

350
00:41:58,787 --> 00:42:01,483
But i dig them all the way.
They are premium people.

351
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:05,023
It's that word, though.
You're not supposed to use that word.

352
00:42:06,161 --> 00:42:07,822
What is wrong with the negroes?

353
00:42:16,471 --> 00:42:20,305
- Are you carnal very often?
- What?

354
00:42:20,475 --> 00:42:23,501
With american girls, you make sex often?

355
00:42:23,678 --> 00:42:26,010
Not really. Do you?

356
00:42:27,582 --> 00:42:30,312
I inquired headmost. Do you?

357
00:42:31,553 --> 00:42:32,918
Not really.

358
00:42:33,221 --> 00:42:35,485
What do you intend by "not really"?

359
00:42:37,058 --> 00:42:39,891
I'm not a priest,
but i'm not john holmes, either.

360
00:42:40,061 --> 00:42:43,224
I've heard of this john holmes.
With a premium penis.

361
00:42:44,032 --> 00:42:45,897
Yeah, that's the one.

362
00:42:46,067 --> 00:42:48,695
In the ukraine,
everybody has a penis like that.

363
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:51,263
What about the women?

364
00:42:53,008 --> 00:42:54,532
You make a joke, no?

365
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:56,570
Yeah.

366
00:43:10,091 --> 00:43:12,355
Come, zlata, come.

367
00:43:40,455 --> 00:43:42,423
Do you have any chewing gum?

368
00:43:54,769 --> 00:43:57,237
Do you know where trachimbrod is?

369
00:43:57,639 --> 00:43:59,630
What's in trachimbrod?

370
00:43:59,808 --> 00:44:02,003
Nothing, it's just a place
we are trying to find.

371
00:44:02,577 --> 00:44:05,842
If there's nothing there,
why are you trying to find it?

372
00:44:06,581 --> 00:44:09,345
Why do you ask stupid questions?

373
00:45:12,247 --> 00:45:13,544
Where are we?

374
00:45:13,715 --> 00:45:15,376
I don't know.

375
00:45:16,584 --> 00:45:18,643
Ask the jew.

376
00:45:20,188 --> 00:45:22,179
- Where are we?
- I'm not sure.

377
00:45:22,357 --> 00:45:23,824
He doesn't know.

378
00:45:23,992 --> 00:45:27,257
What do you mean, he doesn't know?
We're driving! How can he not know!

379
00:45:28,196 --> 00:45:31,165
- What do you mean, you don't know?
- None of the roads have names.

380
00:45:31,332 --> 00:45:33,323
I thought you were a certified guide.

381
00:45:33,535 --> 00:45:35,400
Grandfather is certified.

382
00:45:36,237 --> 00:45:38,671
- Please, you're making this impossible.
- Shut up!

383
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:40,831
This is pointless!
We don't know where we are.

384
00:45:41,009 --> 00:45:43,068
"Shut up" means shut up!

385
00:45:43,244 --> 00:45:44,871
Grandfather, we should stop.

386
00:45:46,915 --> 00:45:49,008
What are you doing?

387
00:45:50,718 --> 00:45:53,482
Maybe we should stop and ask someone.

388
00:46:09,537 --> 00:46:11,471
Go and ask them.

389
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:14,534
Leave the jew here.

390
00:46:15,643 --> 00:46:17,474
I'm not a moron, you know.

391
00:46:20,248 --> 00:46:21,977
I know what that word means.

392
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:23,481
What word?

393
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,150
It's russian for "jew," isn't it?

394
00:46:42,137 --> 00:46:44,332
Wait! I'm coming too.

395
00:46:48,009 --> 00:46:50,443
- What are you doing?
- I'm coming with you.

396
00:46:50,845 --> 00:46:54,406
- You should not do this.
- Why not? I can help.

397
00:46:54,582 --> 00:46:57,107
You cannot help. You cannot even speak.

398
00:46:57,285 --> 00:46:59,685
It is bad enough that i am from odessa.

399
00:47:00,155 --> 00:47:02,623
I won't speak.
I promise, i won't say a word.

400
00:47:26,648 --> 00:47:29,048
Excuse me, could you tell me,
do you know where trachimbrod is?

401
00:47:29,484 --> 00:47:30,815
Never heard of it.

402
00:47:31,386 --> 00:47:32,717
Thank you.

403
00:47:34,155 --> 00:47:36,521
Wait! What are you doing?

404
00:47:36,691 --> 00:47:38,352
They do not know.

405
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:41,791
What about sofiewka?
Did you ask them about sofiewka?

406
00:48:02,717 --> 00:48:05,550
I'm sorry, i forgot,
it's also called sofiewka.

407
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:08,848
What do you want?
I told you i never heard of it!

408
00:48:09,324 --> 00:48:10,723
What's your problem, huh?

409
00:48:11,693 --> 00:48:13,251
Maybe you've seen this woman?

410
00:48:13,428 --> 00:48:14,861
What are you doing?

411
00:48:16,397 --> 00:48:18,058
We are trying to find
the town of trachimbrod.

412
00:48:18,233 --> 00:48:20,565
I told you, we don't know.

413
00:48:21,436 --> 00:48:24,200
Do you want a marlboro cigarette?

414
00:48:27,609 --> 00:48:29,167
Get lost! Go back to kiev!

415
00:48:29,344 --> 00:48:31,676
I'm not from kiev,
i'm from odessa.

416
00:48:31,846 --> 00:48:33,905
Then go back to odessa!

417
00:48:40,455 --> 00:48:42,719
- What did they say?
- Nothing.

418
00:48:42,890 --> 00:48:44,118
They said nothing.

419
00:48:44,292 --> 00:48:47,887
Hey, odessa! You forgot your dog!

420
00:48:51,766 --> 00:48:54,291
Sammy davis jr. Jr., come here!

421
00:49:08,316 --> 00:49:09,340
Hey! Don't do that!

422
00:49:09,517 --> 00:49:10,950
Why were you speaking english?

423
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:13,815
I commanded you not to speak!
You understanded me, yes?

424
00:49:13,988 --> 00:49:15,421
- Yes.
- Then why did you speak?

425
00:49:15,590 --> 00:49:17,319
- I don't know.
- Now they all think...

426
00:49:17,492 --> 00:49:19,426
...l'm stupid american tourist, like you!

427
00:49:19,594 --> 00:49:21,494
- I'm sorry.
- Why do you not listen?

428
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:23,494
This is not your country!

429
00:49:25,466 --> 00:49:26,956
You little piece of shit!

430
00:49:27,135 --> 00:49:29,000
Don't you put your
filthy hands on her!

431
00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:31,730
If you ever hit her again...

432
00:49:31,906 --> 00:49:34,966
...i swear to god,
i'll cut your hands off!

433
00:49:35,476 --> 00:49:37,637
Do you understand,
you piece of shit?

434
00:51:56,150 --> 00:51:57,617
Grandfather?
