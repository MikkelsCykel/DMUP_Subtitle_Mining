<i>This is you.</i>

2
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,511
<i>Eyes closed,</i>
<i>out in the rain.</i>

3
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,034
<i>You never thought you'd be doing</i>
<i>something like this.</i>

4
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,512
<i>You never saw yourself as,</i>

5
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,478
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>how you'd describe it, as...</i>

6
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,789
<i>like one of those people</i>

7
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,076
<i>who like looking up at the moon,</i>

8
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:46,391
<i>or who spend hours gazing at</i>
<i>the waves or the sunset or...</i>

9
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,234
<i>I guess you know what kind of people</i>
<i>I'm talking about</i>

10
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,429
<i>Maybe you don't</i>

11
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,513
<i>Anyway, you kinda you kinda</i>
<i>like it being like this,</i>

12
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,193
<i>fighting the cold</i>

13
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,071
<i>and feeling the water seep</i>
<i>through your shirt</i>

14
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,593
<i>and getting through to your skin.</i>

15
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,833
<i>And the feel of the ground</i>

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,355
<i>growing soft beneath your feet</i>

17
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,035
<i>and the smell.</i>

18
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,793
<i>And the sound of the rain</i>
<i>hitting the leaves.</i>

19
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,112
<i>All the things they talk about</i>
<i>in the books that you haven't read.</i>

20
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,314
<i>This is you.</i>

21
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,959
<i>Who would have guessed it?</i>

22
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,875
<i>You.</i>

23
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,433
<i>Lesson 3.</i>

24
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,749
<i>Dialogue.</i>

25
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,074
Catch this.

26
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,713
You giv<i>e</i> me the big one.

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,830
OK.

28
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,474
Don't you <i>e</i>ven...

29
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,352
So how come you always get...

30
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,390
why do you <i>a</i>lways
get th<i>e</i> big one?

31
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,873
I deserve the big one...

32
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,111
Maybe you should just try
and you know

33
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,876
to get chalk of the blackboard.

34
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,476
Laurie...

35
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,551
Oh, I'm trying to blow it
away from you.

36
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,109
- I thought you were quitting.
- I am quitting. I'm quitting, quitting.

37
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,190
That's gre<i>a</i>t.

38
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,232
I can't quit smoking

39
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,080
and quit eating at the same tim<i>e.</i>

40
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,795
You don't have to quit <i>e</i>ating.
Why would you have to quit e<i>a</i>ting?

41
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,109
You just don't understand.

42
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,430
You lose weight
just by thinking about it.

43
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,632
I swear you're slimmer now
than you were a month ago.

44
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,030
- No, you're imagining it.
- I am not.

45
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,871
When you're fat
like I am,

46
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,873
th<i>e</i> only thing you see
is other women's bodies.

47
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,752
It's the only thing you see.

48
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,638
L<i>a</i>urie, you'r<i>e</i> crazy.

49
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,792
You're not fat at all, okay?

50
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,474
I know fat peopl<i>e.</i> You're not one
of them. Look <i>a</i>t this tummy.

51
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,471
It's not the tummy of <i>a</i> fat person.

52
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,673
As for me,
I'm eating the s<i>a</i>me as always.

53
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,273
Yesterd<i>a</i>y,
I <i>a</i>te a whole litre of ice-cream.

54
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,955
I haven't had ice-cream
in so long.

55
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,276
Say,

56
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,116
you're not following one of those
ic<i>e</i>- cream di<i>e</i>ts are you?

57
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,271
Y<i>e</i>ah, Ben and Jerry's
miracle di<i>e</i>t.

58
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,111
Really?

59
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,196
No.

60
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,273
You know
wh<i>a</i>t I'm thinking of right now?

61
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,156
Wh<i>a</i>t?

62
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,789
Corn on the cob.

63
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,349
With lots of salt, lots of butter.

64
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,196
Just talking about diets
makes me hungry.

65
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,550
See you tomorrow.

66
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,438
- All right. See you tomorrow.
- Tomorrow.

67
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,635
Bye.

68
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,473
Is Don going to look for another job?

69
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,632
Don's alw<i>a</i>ys looking for another job.

70
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,749
I could try and get him
something at the hot<i>e</i>l.

71
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,788
That's okay.

72
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,313
Last thing I n<i>e</i>ed is for you two
to fight there as well.

73
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,718
Why do you hav<i>e</i>
to listen to this stuff?

74
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,678
Why can't you list<i>e</i>n to music
like normal people?

75
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,188
No one's normal, Mom.

76
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,632
No such thing as normal people.

77
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,756
Some muffins for the girls,
for bre<i>a</i>kf<i>a</i>st.

78
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,559
They're a little squashed,
but they're fine.

79
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,432
Who rent<i>e</i>d Nathan's hous<i>e</i>?

80
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,355
I don't know.
Someon<i>e</i>'s moving in on Sunday.

81
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,753
Barry Manilow.

82
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,716
Wh<i>a</i>t?

83
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,674
Barry Manilow.
H<i>e</i>'s normal.

84
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,915
Good night, mom.

85
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,437
Com<i>e</i> on. Move ov<i>e</i>r, buddy.

86
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,391
Are those your feet or are you rubbing
ice-cub<i>e</i>s down my legs?

87
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,039
Y<i>e</i>s, they <i>a</i>re ice-cubes.

88
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,357
Ok<i>a</i>y, warm them up.
That's my only choice.

89
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,558
I'm cold up here, too.

90
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,392
I'm cold everywhere.

91
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,836
Did you put all the laundry
in the basket?

92
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,919
- Y<i>e</i>s.
<i>- Thank you.</i>

93
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,709
Are you tired?

94
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,550
Okay.

95
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,159
No!

96
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,870
I think you're too little.
I'll tell you when you're older.

97
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,995
You guys want some more milk?

98
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,229
Pl<i>e</i>as<i>e</i>, please, tell me now.

99
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,119
Drink up your milk. We've going to go
in about five minutes, all right?

100
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,678
You've spilt your milk.
I told you, you're too little.

101
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,912
Shit, Patsy, can you not drink a gl<i>a</i>ss
of milk for once without spilling it?

102
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,273
No, no, no.

103
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,509
Wh<i>a</i>t are you doing?

104
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,114
Daddy, why don't the Flintstones
<i>e</i>ver go to the beach?

105
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,032
I don't know. Don't change the subj<i>e</i>ct.

106
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,111
Wher<i>e</i> does Mommy
keep your sweaters?

107
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,360
Mommy, I ate all my cere<i>a</i>l
and Patsy didn't.

108
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,072
It's okay, we have accidents.

109
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,992
OK. Under the girls' bed,
in the green box,

110
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,593
there's another sweater under th<i>e</i>re.

111
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,034
Okay, put up your arms.

112
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,395
Come on, we've got to take this off,
okay girlie?

113
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,119
Got a little bit of milk on you.

114
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,395
Are you stuck?

115
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,358
Where's Patsy? I don't know.
There's Patsy.

116
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,199
Th<i>e</i>re you go. Here you go.
Put that on.

117
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,238
Lance's brother rang me last night.
H<i>e</i> said he might have something for me.

118
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,913
No way!
Gr<i>e</i>at!

119
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,559
Where are the k<i>e</i>ys?
I can't find the k<i>e</i>ys.

120
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,676
- They're still in the ignition, I think.
- They are?

121
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,751
Girls, you've got to put on
your jackets.

122
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,349
Mommy, do I have to tell Patsy
where babies come from?

123
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,511
- I think she's too little.
- She is too little.

124
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,238
Can you put on your jacket first?

125
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,868
They open<i>e</i>d a swimming pool
busin<i>e</i>ss in Wilmington Drive.

126
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,393
- No way.
- Y<i>e</i>ah.

127
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,795
I know.

128
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,318
- Good luck.
- Yeah, thank you.

129
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,871
Can you...
You pick up the girls from school,

130
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,598
because I might not be back
till later.

131
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,597
- Yeah, sur<i>e.</i> No problem.
- Ok<i>a</i>y. Guys?

132
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,988
Put on your hats
and gloves, okay?

133
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:30,152
I'm going to warm up the car <i>a</i>nd we're
going to be gone in two minutes, okay?

134
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,073
Two minut<i>e</i>s. Y<i>e</i>s!

135
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,998
I want you to help Patsy
with h<i>e</i>rs as w<i>e</i>ll, okay?

136
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,354
So get yours on and h<i>e</i>lp.

137
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,477
- Bye, guys. Have a good day.
- Bye, Mom.

138
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,790
I got you, I got you.

139
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,597
Ann,

140
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,432
I'm hanging out some wash. You got
anything you want me to hang out?

141
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,749
Ann, are you in there?

142
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,668
Put your clothes in the bag,
and put on the robe.

143
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,239
Do you know
if this is going to tak<i>e</i> long?

144
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,834
- I'm supposed to pick up my kids.
- I really have no idea.

145
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,598
Can I just go tell my Mom
to pick them up for me?

146
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,478
We can't make any exceptions.

147
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,229
Is your mother outside?

148
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,277
Yeah, she came with me.
Ann Matland.

149
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,034
- I forgot to tell her.
- I'll see what I can do.

150
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,033
Now if you could get undressed
or you really will be here all day.

151
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,356
Thank you.

152
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:12,797
John,

153
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,916
Charlie Bob, Seymour,

154
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,195
Jack and Bill.

155
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,872
Follow me, please.

156
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,872
Hey, do you know if the other nurse told
my mom she had to go pick up my kids?

157
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,314
I was supposed to go
and pick them up today and...

158
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,071
Who'd you tell it to?

159
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,275
The other nurse.
I don't know her name.

160
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,789
Do you know how many nurses
we have working in this hospital?

161
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,996
Do you know what it's like to be waiting
at the school gat<i>e a</i>ll on your own,

162
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,115
with your nose fre<i>e</i>zing to death

163
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,872
while all the other kids
get picked up by th<i>e</i>ir moms?

164
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,635
Yeah, I do.

165
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,071
I'll go se<i>e</i> if I can find
your moth<i>e</i>r.

166
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,076
Hi Ann.
I am Doctor Thompson,

167
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,359
I'll be looking at th<i>e</i> results
of your ultrasound.

168
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,398
Why are we doing this again?

169
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,748
How are your kids?

170
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,872
I'm kind of worried, actually,

171
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,031
I was supposed
to pick them up today so...

172
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,919
Let's not worry about thatjust now.
This will be over in a few minutes.

173
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,355
Ann, would you excuse me for a moment?

174
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,318
Y<i>e</i>ah, sure. It's your hospital.

175
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,151
Ann, this is Doctor Stuart
and Doctor L<i>a</i>nce.

176
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,232
Hi! Do you know if someon<i>e</i> told my mom
<i>a</i>bout picking up my daughters?

177
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,949
We're only gonna take
<i>a</i> few minutes, okay?

178
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,598
Does your husband live with you?

179
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,875
Yeah,

180
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,630
he<i>...</i> he builds swimming pools.
He was out all day today.

181
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,190
And you work at the university.

182
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,196
Yeah. I clean the university. Nights.

183
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,959
And you're twenty-three...

184
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,839
I'll be twenty four in December.
I'm <i>a</i>n Aquarius.

185
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,678
How about you? What star sign are you?
What the hell is happening to me?

186
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,157
We've don<i>e</i> th<i>e</i> scan
thre<i>e</i> times and...

187
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,193
Are you sure you wouldn't prefer
to call your husband?

188
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,072
No. I would pr<i>e</i>fer not to call him.

189
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:54,428
We've done the scan three times,
and I've ordered a... a pre-biopsy...

190
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,635
So, what?

191
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,556
You have a tumour.

192
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,674
In both ovaries.

193
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,397
It's reach<i>e</i>d your stomach and it's
beginning to spread to your liver.

194
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,359
Wow. That's pretty f<i>a</i>r gone, eh?

195
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,550
Ann, if you were twenty years older,

196
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,076
the whole thing would be spreading
more slowly we could oper<i>a</i>te on it.

197
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,714
But... your cells are very young.

198
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,950
Too young, in fact

199
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,429
and I'm afraid there's...
there's nothing we can do.

200
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,276
Wow. How long?

201
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,713
Two months, maybe three.

202
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,476
Here's me thinking
I was pregnant...

203
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,675
No, I'm afr<i>a</i>id not.

204
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,833
I knew it was something pretty serious
when you sat down here beside me.

205
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,990
They're renovating my office,
changing the air-conditioning and...

206
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,839
No, that's not true...

207
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:37,235
I can't sit down in front of someone
<i>a</i>nd tell them that they're gonna die...

208
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,232
I've never been able to...

209
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,389
the nurs<i>e</i>s are beginning
to m<i>e</i>ntion it.

210
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,475
Your family might w<i>a</i>nna s<i>e</i>e
another doctor,

211
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,278
they might want
a s<i>e</i>cond opinion.

212
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,000
Someone who tells me the ex<i>a</i>ct s<i>a</i>me thing
as you, but looks me right in the ey<i>e</i>?

213
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,519
Can I get you a coffee?

214
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,196
No.

215
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,630
Bourbon?

216
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,152
Let me guess,
you'r<i>e</i> goinna offer m<i>e a</i> cig<i>a</i>rett<i>e</i>?

217
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,116
No.

218
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,434
Do have a piece of candy?

219
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,954
A pi<i>e</i>ce of...? Yeah.

220
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,355
It's pretty good...

221
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,119
what fl<i>a</i>vour is that?

222
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,429
Ginger.

223
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,315
It's pretty good.

224
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,918
It's a bit hot, but it's okay.

225
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,958
I've... I've prepar<i>e</i>d some leaflets,
which more or less

226
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,953
expl<i>a</i>in ev<i>e</i>rything,

227
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,038
and some recipes

228
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,474
to h<i>e</i>lp e<i>a</i>se the nause<i>a</i>,

229
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,352
and I'd like to see you
next week.

230
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,556
I've given you an appointment
and my direct line

231
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,039
in case you n<i>e</i>ed to c<i>a</i>ll me.

232
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,749
Y<i>e</i>ah... Okay.

233
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,316
Do you have anoth<i>e</i>r piece of candy?
On<i>e</i> for the road?

234
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,278
I'm sorry, that was my last one...

235
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,795
Next week
I'll hav<i>e</i> more... candy.

236
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,876
<i>Your Dad used to drink a bottle</i>
<i>of bourbon and call it breakfast.</i>

237
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,712
<i>You get wired if you drink</i>
<i>so much as a beer.</i>

238
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,791
<i>You didn't even take drugs</i>
<i>during high school,</i>

239
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,910
<i>just the odd drag</i>
<i>of Don's joint.</i>

240
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:27,071
<i>Without inhaling, like that guy who used</i>
<i>to be President of the United States,</i>

241
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,988
<i>that guy Bill Clinton.</i>

242
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,513
So, were they waiting long?

243
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,074
Oh, good.

244
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,556
Good, thanks a lot, Mom.
I owe you one.

245
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,749
No, no, they're doing
blood analysis.

246
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,514
Apparently I've got anaemia...
that's why I've b<i>e</i>en fainting.

247
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,352
You know th<i>e</i>y're like, once they'v<i>e</i>
got you, they don't w<i>a</i>nt to let you go.

248
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,268
Trying out some new machine,
they're like littl<i>e</i> kids.

249
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:52,677
You know, I should go, Mom,

250
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,159
'cause the nurse is coming to g<i>e</i>t me,
I've got to go.

251
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,559
Okay, bye, thanks <i>a</i> lot.

252
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,713
<i>Now you feel like you want to take</i>
<i>all the drugs in the world.</i>

253
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,149
<i>But all the drugs in the world</i>
<i>aren't going to change the feeling</i>

254
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:09,029
<i>that your whole life's been a dream</i>
<i>and it's only now that you're waking up.</i>

255
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,434
"But I like to eat cake in a tub",
laugh<i>e</i>d the c<i>a</i>t.

256
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,398
"You should try it sometime",
laughed the c<i>a</i>t as he sat.

257
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,551
And then I got m<i>a</i>d,
ther<i>e</i> was no time for fun.

258
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,472
I said "Cat you get out!"

259
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,031
Hi, Mommy.

260
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,913
Hi. You'v<i>e</i> be<i>e</i>n good?

261
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,117
Mom, can you tell us a story?
Daddy says it too fast.

262
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,033
Hey. Thanks a lot. You little monster.

263
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,274
I don't read them too fast.

264
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,635
- How <i>a</i>re you?
- Good. I've got anaemia,

265
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,915
that's why I've b<i>e</i>en fainting,

266
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,799
so th<i>e</i>y gav<i>e</i> me some iron and vitamins.
How did it go with Lance?

267
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,193
I start on Monday.

268
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,278
Hey, no w<i>a</i>y! That's so good.

269
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,352
Y<i>e</i>s. I know, and there's enough work
for a year at l<i>e</i>ast.

270
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,159
- That's so gre<i>a</i>t!
- I know, it's great.

271
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,995
- Did you giv<i>e</i> th<i>e</i> girls something to eat?
- Daddy gave us milk shakes and fries.

272
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,833
He said we mustn't tell you.
It was so nice.

273
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,712
Mommy, I at<i>e a</i>ll my fri<i>e</i>s
and all my milk shake.

274
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,713
Fri<i>e</i>s are vegetables, right? They're
potatoes, which is a very good food.

275
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,279
It's one of the food groups.

276
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,077
I'm sorry,

277
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,878
it was a littl<i>e</i> treat. I just got a job.

278
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,235
- What is wrong with you?
- I'm sorry.

279
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:36,235
- Okay. The rafters, in a second.
- Can I stay, or should I go?

280
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,588
You c<i>a</i>n stay.

281
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,959
That's okay. Good night, you two.

282
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,955
Close our ey<i>e</i>s.

283
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,030
Close our ey<i>e</i>s.
We're setting off. Okay?

284
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,156
Oh, no!

285
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,237
It's getting wavier <i>a</i>nd wavi<i>e</i>r
and we...

286
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,878
and then we splash down in the water.

287
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,430
No,

288
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,831
- what's that?
- Is that a shark?

289
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,319
It is a shark.

290
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,595
They're really really mad at us.

291
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,318
They thought
th<i>a</i>t this river was the oce<i>a</i>n.

292
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,674
They're really mad!

293
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,313
Here, I think you should eat those.

294
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,469
Are you going to go to work?

295
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,509
Yeah, I'll go in.

296
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,519
Your moth<i>e</i>r said she could get
a lift back if you w<i>a</i>nt to rest.

297
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,635
No, I should go in.

298
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,839
I thought you were pregnant.

299
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,514
Ye<i>a</i>h. Me too.

300
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,989
You sure you'r<i>e</i> all right?

301
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,555
Yes, I'm good,
I'm just a little bit tir<i>e</i>d, that's all.

302
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:56,191
You know, next month when I g<i>e</i>t
my paycheck we could go to Wh<i>a</i>lebay Beach.

303
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,749
Would you like that?

304
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:58,791
Yeah,

305
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,635
that'd be nice.

306
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,634
P<i>a</i>tsy hasn't <i>e</i>ven be<i>e</i>n
at the beach before.

307
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,352
Yeah. I've got a good fe<i>e</i>ling
about things,

308
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,877
with the swimming pools, I mean.

309
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,235
I really do.

310
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,796
<i>Thinking.</i>

311
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,597
<i>You're not used</i>
<i>to thinking.</i>

312
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,436
<i>When you have your first kid</i>
<i>at seventeen with the only man</i>

313
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,999
<i>you've ever kissed in your life,</i>

314
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,869
<i>and then another kid when you're</i>
<i>nineteen, with the same man,</i>

315
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,429
<i>and you live in a trailer</i>
<i>in your Mom's backyard,</i>

316
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,636
<i>and your Dad's been in jail</i>
<i>for ten years,</i>

317
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,233
<i>you never have time to think.</i>

318
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,596
<i>Maybe you're so out of practice</i>
<i>you've forgotten how.</i>

319
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,598
- What is this?
- It's coffee.

320
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,913
- Yes. I asked for an espresso.
- Th<i>e e</i>spresso machine ain't working.

321
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,713
So if the espresso machine
wasn't working,

322
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,836
then why didn't you tell me
the espresso machine wasn't working?

323
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,355
I figured you wanted coffee.

324
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,715
You brought me a coffee.
I asked for an espr<i>e</i>sso.

325
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,393
Okay, just relax.

326
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,518
Com<i>e</i> back n<i>e</i>xt week,
we'll have espresso.

327
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,834
- Hey, could you please lend me a pen?
- Sure, honey,

328
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,877
just t<i>e</i>ll me what you w<i>a</i>nt first,
so as I can write it down

329
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,395
and then I can lend it to you,
that way w<i>e</i>'ll all be happy.

330
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,152
Okay, I'll hav<i>e...</i>

331
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,394
Don't say espresso because
th<i>e e</i>spresso machine ain't working...

332
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,869
don't say cappuccino
'caus<i>e</i> it's the same machine.

333
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,189
Ok<i>a</i>y, I'll have a...

334
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,189
a Danish.

335
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,952
Got no more 'til tomorrow.

336
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,876
Can I g<i>e</i>t then a coffee and

337
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,069
just something swe<i>e</i>t, like anything
you have that's sweet.

338
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,551
Pineapple cheesecake?

339
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,676
It's the sweetest thing we got.
Actually it's the only thing we've got.

340
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,558
That's fin<i>e</i>, that's great.
Pine<i>a</i>pple cheesecak<i>e.</i>

341
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,630
Okay.

342
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,033
Ther<i>e</i> you go,
the world's sweetest chees<i>e</i>cake.

343
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,311
You can keep the pen
for as long as you ne<i>e</i>d it.

344
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,311
I <i>a</i>lready filled
in the lottery ticket <i>e</i>arlier.

345
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,755
What <i>a</i>re you going to do if you win?
Have you decided?

346
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,512
Have I ev<i>e</i>r, honey.

347
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,954
I want to be like her.

348
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,751
I want her nos<i>e</i>,

349
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,876
her mouth, her ey<i>e</i>s,

350
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,792
her hair, her waist...

351
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,552
I'm going to be so much lik<i>e</i> Cher

352
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,075
that folks ar<i>e</i> gonna stop me
in the supermarket and say

353
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,549
<i>"Wasn't it terrible what happened</i>
<i>to dear old Sonny?"</i>

354
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,115
What do you think?

355
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,316
I think that's
a r<i>e</i>ally fucking stupid ide<i>a.</i>

356
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,350
I'm just kidding.

357
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,834
I think Ch<i>e</i>r is great.

358
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,796
Penny, Patsy, I'm making
a big heap of pancakes.

359
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,188
If you don't come right this second

360
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,918
I'm going to eat all of them
all by myself.

361
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,678
I'm coming, Mommy.

362
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,033
- Morning, buddy.
- Hi, Mommy.

363
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,150
I guess P<i>a</i>tsy do<i>e</i>sn't want
any pancakes, eh?

364
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,878
No pancakes for Patsy.

365
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,353
Is it Sunday yet?
Is it my birthday?

366
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,794
No, but you know what?

367
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,030
Last night I dreamt

368
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,760
that you wok<i>e</i> up
like hungry lions

369
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,315
and you ate lots of food.

370
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,114
I'll cut it up for you. Ther<i>e</i> you go.

371
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,396
Are you going to take
the kids to school?

372
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,075
The bigg<i>e</i>st lion of th<i>e</i>m all.

373
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,275
Go get him, Patsy.

374
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,796
Bye. I love you, my little lions,

375
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,669
I love you so much.

376
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,588
I love you.

377
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,439
I kind of want...

378
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,674
something different.

379
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,195
Different...

380
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,032
To what I've got at th<i>e</i> moment, I mean.

381
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,713
I could do you braids,
but it would take all day...

382
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,672
and I'm on my own here
on Wednesdays, so...

383
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,512
Not braids.
No way.

384
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,751
Well, you've got good h<i>a</i>ir
for braids.

385
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,790
And you asked for something
different, so...

386
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,799
Braids are fine.
Th<i>e</i>y look great on you, but...

387
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,593
I w<i>a</i>s thinking of som<i>e</i>thing mor<i>e...</i>

388
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,874
How about blonde?

389
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,269
Blonde?

390
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,029
Something to kind of...

391
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,558
- bright<i>e</i>n up my face a bit.
- Something bright.

392
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:53,991
Like this?

393
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,151
I was also wondering
about fals<i>e</i> nails.

394
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,309
I don't have any nails and...

395
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,992
The girl who do<i>e</i>s the nails
doesn't come in W<i>e</i>dnesd<i>a</i>ys.

396
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,952
You what then, why I don't just
com<i>e</i> back tomorrow then.

397
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,554
We can do it all at the same time,
can't we?

398
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,915
Braids as well?

399
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,350
I'll think <i>a</i>bout it. Ok,
I'll see you tomorrow. Bye.

400
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,992
I had two conventions today

401
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,993
and I had to make a cake
for three hundred people

402
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,798
in the shape of a tyr<i>e.</i>

403
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,394
I'm beat.

404
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,633
Even my hips ache.

405
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,914
I think I'm going to make an appointment
to s<i>e</i>e the doctor tomorrow.

406
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,718
My knee's acting up again as well.

407
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,154
That d<i>a</i>mn cak<i>e</i> must have
weighed 30 pounds.

408
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,036
How about you? You feeling any better?

409
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,919
Yeah, I'm f<i>e</i>eling fine.

410
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,518
They say it's going to snow
this weekend, but I don't think so.

411
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,714
I hate the snow.

412
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,910
I like the snow
<i>e</i>ven l<i>e</i>ss than I like the rain.

413
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:04,154
<i>... because you'll never be anything</i>
<i>but a common frump</i>

414
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,117
<i>whose father lived over</i>
<i>a grocery store</i>

415
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,918
<i>and whose mother took in washing.</i>

416
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,433
<i>With this money, I can get away from</i>

417
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,797
<i>every rotten stinking thing that</i>
<i>makes me think of this place or you.</i>

418
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,111
<i>You must think I'm on a string.</i>

419
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,878
<i>Go away, Veda,</i>
<i>come back, Veda.</i>

420
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,713
<i>It isn't that easy.</i>

421
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,195
<i>Alone.</i>

422
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,715
<i>You're alone.</i>

423
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,315
<i>You've never been</i>
<i>so alone in your live.</i>

424
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,912
<i>Lies are your only company.</i>

425
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,992
GONE TO THE LAUNDROMAT.
WE'RE OUT FO CLEAN CLOTHES.

426
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,718
- Can I get you something?
- Can I get a Molson Canadian, please?

427
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,310
Hi!

428
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,075
Hi.

429
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,989
- I haven't seen you h<i>e</i>re befor<i>e.</i>
- No.

430
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,715
I'm sorry <i>a</i>bout the thing
with the braids this morning.

431
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,677
I shouldn't really have sugg<i>e</i>sted it,

432
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,834
but I was having
a kind of weird morning...

433
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,314
you ever get those?

434
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,391
You know, when youjust
can't face th<i>e</i> world?

435
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,994
It's v<i>e</i>ry stressful being
a hairdresser,

436
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,112
people expect a lot from you

437
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,270
and sometimes
you can't stand the pressure.

438
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:39,159
People want you
to m<i>a</i>ke them beautiful

439
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,959
but som<i>e</i>times
it's just not possible.

440
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,394
You know what?
Don't worry <i>a</i>bout it,

441
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,198
I wasn't h<i>a</i>ving
a great morning either, so...

442
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,952
Now, can I ask you
<i>a</i> personal question?

443
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,313
Do you lik<i>e</i> Milli Vanilli?

444
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,434
You mean thos<i>e</i> guys in shorts
who didn't sing.

445
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,953
Oh, you're wrong there.

446
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,919
They did sing, but their produc<i>e</i>r
wouldn't let them.

447
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,231
He practically blackmailed them

448
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,197
and said he would tell everyone
their secret,

449
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,351
and he got
all the royalties.

450
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,912
It was so unfair.

451
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,192
And later they showed
that they could sing,

452
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,555
but you know no one listened to them.

453
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,352
They w<i>e</i>re too fragile
for th<i>e</i> music industry.

454
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,074
- What kind of music do you like?
- Music?

455
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,109
God, I h<i>a</i>ven't listened to any music
in so long.

456
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,314
I used to like Nirv<i>a</i>n<i>a.</i>

457
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,039
I went to one of th<i>e</i>ir concerts...

458
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,599
actu<i>a</i>lly it was
their last conc<i>e</i>rt.

459
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:35,548
That's actually wher<i>e</i> I met Don,
my husband.

460
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,710
He was...

461
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,519
Hold th<i>a</i>t thought,
ljust got to get up and dance.

462
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,636
The DJ's <i>a</i> friend of mine.
I'll be back.

463
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,349
I'm going to go get
a cup coffee next door.

464
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:45,318
I was wondering if m<i>a</i>yb<i>e</i>
you wanted me to go and get you one too?

465
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,235
No, thanks.

466
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,317
Yeah, actually, please, yeah.

467
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,637
Sure. Milk and sugar, ple<i>a</i>se.

468
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,275
Thanks.

469
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,559
Your coffee's cold.

470
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,273
I w<i>a</i>s kind of tired.

471
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,914
I washed,
folded your laundry.

472
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,550
Thanks.

473
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,158
I didn't forget the softener,
did I?

474
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,231
No, you forgot the soap.

475
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,870
Were you watching m<i>e</i>
while I w<i>a</i>s asl<i>e</i>ep?

476
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,390
Y<i>e</i>ah, for a little while. Sorry.

477
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,555
Why?

478
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,036
I was snoring or...?

479
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,919
No, you were drooling.
You drool when you sle<i>e</i>p.

480
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,909
Are you that girl? That girl

481
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,188
at the coffee shop

482
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,476
that was writing in a journ<i>a</i>l
the other day?

483
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,239
Thanks for th<i>e</i> j<i>a</i>ck<i>e</i>t.

484
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,189
It's yours, isn't it?

485
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,032
Yeah, you can keep it if you want.

486
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:19,829
It's mighty cold out there
<i>a</i>nd I'm us<i>e</i>d to it.

487
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,037
I was in Alaska for three years,
I lived ther<i>e</i>, I m<i>e</i>an, two and <i>a</i> half.

488
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,155
It's all right.

489
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,834
I really like the cold.
It m<i>a</i>kes me feel really alive.

490
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,754
I'v<i>e</i> got to run. I'v<i>e</i> got
two young kids. You know how it is.

491
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,030
Sure.

492
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:45,910
Thanks.

493
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,918
- I'll see you around.
- My name's Lee.

494
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:52,916
Ann.

495
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,992
Are you sure that
you don't need the jacket?

496
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,317
No, no. Go ahead, take it.

497
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:13,638
Okay. I've never been to Alaska.
I always really liked the sound of it.

498
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,793
- I'll bring the jacket back, don't worry.
- No. I want you to have it.

499
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,878
I like the idea of you we<i>a</i>ring it.

500
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,549
That's nice.

501
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,958
I'll bring it back, don't worry.

502
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,077
<i>You see things clearly now.</i>

503
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:05,272
<i>You see all these all these</i>
<i>barrelled lifes, barrelled voices.</i>

504
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,957
<i>Milli Vanilli everywhere.</i>

505
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,795
<i>You look at all the things</i>
<i>you can't buy,</i>

506
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,270
<i>now you don't even</i>
<i>wanna buy.</i>

507
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:17,479
<i>All the things that will still</i>
<i>be here after you're gone.</i>

508
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,439
<i>When you're dead.</i>

509
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,914
<i>And then you realize</i>
<i>that all the things</i>

510
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,718
<i>in the bright window displays,</i>

511
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,151
<i>all the models</i>
<i>in the catalogues,</i>

512
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,834
<i>all the colours,</i>
<i>all the special offers,</i>

513
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,911
<i>all the Martha Stewart</i>
<i>recipes,</i>

514
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,469
<i>all the piles</i>
<i>of greasy food,</i>

515
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,235
<i>it's just all thereto try</i>
<i>and keep us away from death.</i>

516
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,359
<i>And it doesn't work.</i>

517
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:44,279
So, it turns out that she loved
her daughter so much

518
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,396
that she didn't tell her
that she was her mother,

519
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,879
b<i>e</i>cause she didn't...

520
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,031
she thought
that would be better,

521
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,156
the boy's parents
would accept her better

522
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,912
and the boy would ask her
to marry him,

523
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,036
which was what she w<i>a</i>nted
most in the whole world.

524
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,278
But it was a hug<i>e</i> sacrifice,

525
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,590
and sh<i>e</i> suffered a whole lot,

526
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:06,510
Mommy, Grandma told us
a b<i>e</i>autiful story <i>a</i>bout a mom

527
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:09,717
who has lots of bad things happen
to her, and it's r<i>e</i>ally sad.

528
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,552
Goodness, how unusual.

529
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,909
I bathed th<i>e</i>m

530
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,036
and Penny ate thr<i>e</i>e slic<i>e</i>s
of banana bread

531
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,351
and Patsy drank some milk.
Lately she's been kind of off it.

532
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,436
Grandma's story's a movie,

533
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,272
Mommy, and she says she lik<i>e</i>s it a lot.

534
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,795
- R<i>e</i>ally?
- Yeah, Joan Crawford.

535
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,838
Joan Crawford, that's gr<i>e</i>at!
Okay, let's go, guys.

536
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,072
Patsy, put th<i>a</i>t down.
Patsy. We're going.

537
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,796
I just wanted to keep them entertained,
you know, so they don't watch so much TV.

538
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,473
N<i>e</i>xt time I'll keep my mouth shut.

539
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,949
Mommy, I don't want to go
to school tomorrow.

540
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:46,157
- I don't want to.
- I know, I know.

541
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,796
I said thanks, okay?
So just drop it.

542
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,997
- I don't need your thanks.
- Okay, so I'll take them back then.

543
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,917
All I did was watch your kids
while you did your shopping.

544
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,229
You asked me to.

545
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,516
Ye<i>a</i>h, I asked you to.
I didn't ask you to fill their heads

546
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,797
with stupid stories <i>a</i>bout mothers
m<i>a</i>king dumb-ass sacrifices.

547
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,237
What kind of stories
do you want me to tell th<i>e</i>m?

548
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,550
Cinderella?
About murderous step-mothers?

549
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,551
- Is that what you want?
- Y<i>e</i>s!

550
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,195
There's times th<i>a</i>t you're
just like your father,

551
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,032
<i>a</i>nd let me tell you,
it's not something I like.

552
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,713
You're wrong, there's times
th<i>a</i>t I'm just like you,

553
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,472
and it's not something I like either.

554
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,750
I'm sorry, it's just really tangled.

555
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,998
P<i>a</i>tsy's always whining.

556
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,111
Penny, please don't pick on her.

557
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,635
You always complain
when I brush your hair too.

558
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,677
- Why do you hav<i>e</i> to do that?
- I wasn't picking on her.

559
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,478
And telling me
that she's always complaining,

560
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,993
that's not picking on her?
I think so.

561
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,912
I wasn't picking on her.

562
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,998
I'm not always complaining.

563
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,912
Okay, that's enough, guys.

564
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,753
Go to bed, ok<i>a</i>y?

565
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,996
Okay, good night, monk<i>e</i>y girl.
You got kitty?

566
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,874
- Yeah.
- Ther<i>e</i> you go. You've got some covers.

567
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,600
'Night, buddy.
You don't want me to kiss you?

568
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,749
I wasn't picking on her.

569
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:09,593
Penny, that is <i>e</i>nough,
I said, okay?

570
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,436
It's true you're just
like Grandma.

571
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,591
H<i>e</i>y. Do you want some leftover chicken?

572
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,159
Ar<i>e</i>n't you going to say hello?

573
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,638
How many beers hav<i>e</i> you had?

574
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,031
Well, one or two or...

575
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,479
four. I don't know.

576
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:44,117
- You want some chicken or don't you?
- I want a kiss.

577
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:48,233
I want a big, juicy kiss.

578
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,759
Here's some chicken.

579
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,157
Great. Chicken.

580
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,114
It's good.

581
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,353
Have the girls been
in bed long?

582
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,079
Yeah, a littl<i>e</i> whil<i>e.</i>

583
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,393
Penny's was picking
on Patsy again.

584
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,516
I told her not to
and she got kind of mad at me.

585
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,238
- She did?
- Ye<i>a</i>h, a little bit.

586
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,196
We started
a pool out at Rushmore tod<i>a</i>y.

587
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,920
- Oh yeah?
- Ye<i>a</i>h. It's crescent-sh<i>a</i>p<i>e</i>d.

588
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,919
It's going to look wild.

589
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:31,032
These people,
they got a thr<i>e</i>e- story hous<i>e</i>,

590
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,668
a porch out of "Gone With th<i>e</i> Wind"
<i>a</i>nd everything.

591
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,355
It's beautiful.

592
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,034
Are you happy?

593
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,076
With th<i>e</i> swimming pool thing, I mean.

594
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,434
Yeah, it's good.

595
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:45,715
It's not like th<i>e</i> factory
but it's b<i>e</i>tt<i>e</i>r than nothing.

596
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,873
I'm going to get to work.

597
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,880
You not just going to l<i>e</i>ave m<i>e</i> here alone
gn<i>a</i>wing on a cold chicken bone, ar<i>e</i> you?

598
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:54,510
If you like you can always heat it up,
but I thought you really loved cold food.

599
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,636
Why don't you just eat it cold?

600
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,033
Will you sing to me?

601
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,519
No, I have to go to work.

602
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,796
You know how much I love it
wh<i>e</i>n you sing to me.

603
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,235
Please.

604
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,834
Just sing to m<i>e.</i>

605
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,155
Hi.

606
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:45,510
Hi.

607
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,789
Bye...

608
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:49,909
Bye...

609
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,879
Hey, my buddy Penny.

610
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,712
I'm not going to be
at your birthday p<i>a</i>rty,

611
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,633
but there's nothing I'd like more
in the whole, wide world.

612
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,715
I bet Gr<i>a</i>ndm<i>a</i>'s m<i>a</i>d<i>e a</i> sp<i>e</i>cial
birthday cake just for

613
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,950
you with your name on it
in big chocolate letters.

614
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,992
Penny, I w<i>a</i>nt you to know
that th<i>e</i> day that you were born

615
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,593
I held you in my arms

616
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,320
and that was the happiest d<i>a</i>y
in my whole life.

617
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:43,194
I was so happy
I couldn't even speak.

618
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,477
I just strok<i>e</i>d your tiny little feet
and I cried with h<i>a</i>ppiness.

619
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:52,033
Without you I could have never found out
that lions e<i>a</i>t pancakes

620
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,316
or that the b<i>e</i>d
could be a raft.

621
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:56,910
Try and look after Patsy, okay?

622
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:04,152
I know it's hard 'caus<i>e</i> sometimes
sh<i>e</i> mak<i>e</i>s you mad and ev<i>e</i>rything.

623
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:09,076
I know it's not easy being a big sister,
but I know that you can do it, okay?

624
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:14,669
Mommy sends you millions
and millions of kiss<i>e</i>s.

625
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:32,396
H<i>a</i>ppy birthday,
my darling little Patsy.

626
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,839
Now you're fiv<i>e</i>!

627
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,270
I'll b<i>e</i>t that Penny looks after you now.

628
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:39,831
I bet that sh<i>e</i> doesn't pick
on you anymore.

629
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:44,238
Honey, I don't want you to be sad
that I'm not at your birthday, okay?

630
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,515
Promise?

631
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:49,080
I remember your first birthday
really well, you know?

632
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:52,556
I remember how you start<i>e</i>d to cry

633
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,996
and you wouldn't stop b<i>e</i>caus<i>e</i> you didn't
like how w<i>e</i> were singing "Happy Birthday".

634
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,360
Every time we started to sing,
you'd just scream and yell

635
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,909
because you didn't lik<i>e</i>
how we were singing.

636
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:07,598
Happy birthday, my little buddy.

637
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:11,552
Mommy loves you to bits.

638
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:20,558
Buddy, I want you to be happy.

639
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,951
I know sometim<i>e</i>s
it's not easy 'c<i>a</i>use

640
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:25,478
sometimes things happen

641
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,151
and people aren't always
like you want them to be.

642
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:30,959
Talk to your Dad
if there's things bothering you, okay?

643
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:32,599
He knows more
than you'd think, s<i>e</i>riously,

644
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:35,320
if th<i>e</i>re's something bothering you
and you're not sure about something,

645
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:38,836
just ask him and he'll t<i>e</i>ll you.
Grandma knows a lot of things, too.

646
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:41,116
I r<i>e</i>ally hope
she'll <i>e</i>xplain them to you.

647
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:43,994
Try and be patient with her, OK?

648
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:47,550
She is a good person, <i>e</i>ven if sometimes
it doesn't always seem that way...

649
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:53,552
None of the things she's always dr<i>e</i>am<i>e</i>d
about ever c<i>a</i>me true, you know?

650
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:56,518
Try and understand her.
Don't let her make you mad.

651
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:05,316
If you g<i>e</i>t a n<i>e</i>w Mom,
try and love her, okay?

652
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:08,753
Don't make life impossible for her
just out of some loyalty to me

653
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:09,909
or something like that.

654
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:11,236
Just I don't know...

655
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,199
I know it's not the sam<i>e.</i>

656
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:22,794
...and wh<i>a</i>tev<i>e</i>r happens,
you finish school,

657
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,077
even if you think it sucks,
and you don't know

658
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:27,920
if you can take it anymore,
you just finish school.

659
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:32,714
I'd lik<i>e</i> to be able to tell you
stuff about boys

660
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:37,469
and boyfri<i>e</i>nds and relationships
and that kind of stuff,

661
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,278
I think
I wouldn't b<i>e</i> much help.

662
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:44,155
I was s<i>e</i>vente<i>e</i>n
when you were born, Penny,

663
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,911
exactly how old
you are right now.

664
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,797
You hav<i>e</i> to have f<i>a</i>ith in yourself.

665
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:52,829
You have to have f<i>a</i>ith
in your ability to do things,

666
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,353
to just mak<i>e</i> a go of it.

667
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:57,871
Lots of kisses and cuddl<i>e</i>s,

668
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:02,108
even though I know you're not
a small little thing anymore.

669
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:43,789
Ann, is something wrong?

670
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:47,435
What is it?

671
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,038
Is it that diet you're on?

672
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:08,112
How come you're throwing up?

673
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,236
You're not taking
thos<i>e</i> slimming pills, are you?

674
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:13,959
You want to know why I'm throwing up?

675
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:19,713
You really want to know?

676
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,791
I'm throwing up because
when I was eight years old

677
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:28,430
the girl who was supposed to be my best
friend told <i>e</i>veryone I was a slut.

678
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,518
I'm throwing up 'cause
when I was fifteen years old

679
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:35,070
I didn't get invited to the only party
I ever wanted to go to in my entire life.

680
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,117
I'm throwing up because when
I was seventeen I had my first kid

681
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:40,350
and I had to grow up
overnight.

682
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:42,232
And I've got no more dreams.

683
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:45,155
Without dre<i>a</i>ms
you can't fucking live.

684
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:50,997
I'm throwing up because sinc<i>e</i> they put
my dad in jail I haven't seen him.

685
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:52,948
I don't have anything from him,

686
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,951
I don't even h<i>a</i>ve
a single fucking postcard.

687
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:00,317
And in all the commercials
everybody is so fucking happy

688
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:03,438
and <i>a</i>ll day long my two little daughters
sing those stupid fucking songs

689
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:05,670
from those stupid fucking commercials.

690
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:13,999
If I beg you,

691
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,074
if I g<i>e</i>t down on my knees
to beg you...

692
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:23,709
please, don't give me the name
of that diet you're on.

693
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:37,548
I didn't wake you up, did I?

694
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,274
It's Ann.

695
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:44,198
Can I bring you back
your book now?

696
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:47,879
Yeah, right now.

697
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,077
Yeah, ok<i>a</i>y, I know where that is.

698
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:02,151
I should have given you
a raincoat. Come on in.

699
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:09,353
- It's got a bit w<i>e</i>t.
- Don't worry about it.

700
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:16,354
What happened?

701
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:20,358
You didn't keep up the p<i>a</i>yments on your
furniture and they took it <i>a</i>ll away?

702
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:23,550
No.

703
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,632
Well, actually, I was

704
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:30,828
planning on getting
some furniture on<i>e</i> day,

705
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,558
I just didn't re<i>a</i>lly hav<i>e</i> the time.

706
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:39,749
Sorry, I'd off<i>e</i>r you something,
but I don't have anything.

707
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:42,877
I don't ev<i>e</i>n have any gl<i>a</i>ss<i>e</i>s.

708
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:46,115
Not even like a cookie or something?

709
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:48,389
Nothing.

710
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:53,438
If I kn<i>e</i>w you wer<i>e</i> coming,
I would have bought something.

711
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,752
I can live without cookies.

712
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,479
Who took
all your furnitur<i>e</i>?

713
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:05,515
Someone...

714
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:08,389
took it... yeah.

715
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:12,431
You don't w<i>a</i>nt to get anymore
because you think she might come back?

716
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:25,674
You wanna sit down?

717
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:33,317
Thanks.

718
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:38,873
Are they okay?

719
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:46,593
What did you do in Alaska?

720
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:49,269
I'm a surveyor.

721
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:53,149
I survey land for building highways,
bridges and things like that.

722
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:56,312
Befor<i>e</i> th<i>a</i>t I was in

723
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,110
Chile.

724
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,070
And b<i>e</i>fore that I was in

725
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,113
North C<i>a</i>rolina,

726
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:05,596
and before that H<i>a</i>lifax.

727
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:12,759
What are your daughters call?

728
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:14,348
Penny and P<i>a</i>tsy.

729
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:17,633
Would you lik<i>e</i> to see a photograph?

730
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:21,150
Okay.

731
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:33,593
Th<i>e</i>y look h<i>a</i>ppy.

732
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:36,233
They look like you.

733
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:38,759
Do I look happy?

734
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:40,509
Not happy.

735
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:42,834
You look beautiful.

736
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,479
You look like your girls.

737
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:52,999
You've been thinking about me?

738
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:58,830
Yeah.

739
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:02,431
I've been thinking about you a lot.

740
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:05,829
Too much.

741
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:26,438
I'v<i>e</i> got a sister, you know, who...

742
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:30,148
sh<i>e</i> works for this radio
company up north.

743
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:35,557
And she makes these tapes for me
that she sends to me,

744
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:38,996
music th<i>a</i>t she likes and

745
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:41,233
I've got the latest one

746
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:43,231
out in my car right now.

747
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:46,558
We could go listen to it,

748
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:48,469
if you want...

749
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:55,194
If you don't kiss me right now,
I'm going to scream.

750
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:05,956
Shut up!

751
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:30,439
If you don't kiss me right now,
I'm goinna fucking scream.

752
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:54,550
Hello, Ann.

753
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:57,754
This some kind of therapy
to get over your shyness?

754
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:59,035
Something like that.

755
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:02,312
So you didn't come last we<i>e</i>k.

756
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:05,591
Th<i>e</i>re didn't seem to be a lot of point.

757
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:10,155
I have to give you <i>a</i> further scan
and <i>a</i> fuller biopsy.

758
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:11,954
No, I'm sorry.

759
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:14,397
I don't want any of those things, okay?

760
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:17,912
I ne<i>e</i>d to feel
like I'v<i>e</i> got some control.

761
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:21,916
So I don't w<i>a</i>nt any more tests
if they're not going to save me.

762
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:23,832
I don't want to di<i>e</i> here.

763
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,798
I will not have the only thing my kids
remember about me be a hospital ward.

764
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:29,393
So why are you here?

765
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:34,678
It's this package.

766
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,118
I want you to look <i>a</i>fter it for me.

767
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:39,628
I don't know. What is it?

768
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:42,633
I've recorded birthday m<i>e</i>ss<i>a</i>g<i>e</i>s
for both of my daughters,

769
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:44,597
for every birthday
till they're eighteen.

770
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:47,037
And you want me
to give these, don't you?

771
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:51,438
Why don't you ask your husband?

772
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:52,795
'Caus<i>e...</i>

773
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:57,148
'cause Don, you know, he'd lose them

774
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:00,433
or maybe he'd give them to them next year,
and maybe the year after that,

775
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:02,511
or maybe he'd give them to th<i>e</i>m
all at onc<i>e.</i>

776
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:05,030
They wouldn't understand
a thing if he did that,

777
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:06,952
so... please tell me
you'll do it, please.

778
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:10,437
I'll only do it
if you promise to com<i>e</i> here

779
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:12,795
every week
and I have to give you medication.

780
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:16,316
I would imagine that the n<i>a</i>usea's
got worse, you're not eating.

781
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:18,789
Dying's not as easy as it looks.

782
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:22,669
But there's no ne<i>e</i>d for you to have
to fe<i>e</i>l terrible all the time.

783
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:24,836
It's just...

784
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:27,149
It's just I'm kind of afraid

785
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:29,788
I'm going to come in her<i>e</i> one d<i>a</i>y
and I'm never gonna leave...

786
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:34,234
and I've got to so much
I have to do before I di<i>e</i>,

787
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,118
I h<i>a</i>ve so many things I have to do.

788
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:37,474
I have to do them, or...

789
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:40,036
It'II only bejust som<i>e</i> painkillers.

790
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:43,869
I promise we won't do any more tests,
just something to ease the pain.

791
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:46,035
And anyway...

792
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:50,238
I brought you some candies.

793
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:54,634
- So you'll look after it for me?
- Of course.

794
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:58,152
L<i>e</i>t's just say it's part
of your ther<i>a</i>py.

795
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:06,111
God. These candies are so good.

796
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:14,995
I don't g<i>e</i>t it.

797
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:18,357
I've been counting my calories tod<i>a</i>y,
and I c<i>a</i>n't h<i>a</i>ve eaten more than 1500,

798
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:21,751
and in theory I need 2000,
so in theory I should hav<i>e</i> lost weight,

799
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:23,996
and I just weighed mys<i>e</i>lf
before I left th<i>e</i> house

800
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:26,469
and I weigh nearly a pound
mor<i>e</i> th<i>a</i>n I did yesterday.

801
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:28,631
It must be my metabolism.

802
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:31,992
They should give us compensation
for slow met<i>a</i>bolisms,

803
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:34,473
give us some kind of allowance.

804
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:37,957
Laurie, you want to come over
for dinner tomorrow night?

805
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:40,509
Yeah, I'd love to.

806
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:41,791
Great.

807
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:43,149
Diet food, I hope.

808
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:45,118
I don't want to ruin my diet.

809
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:55,878
<i>It's cold in the supermarket,</i>
<i>and you like it like that.</i>

810
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:59,997
<i>People always read the labels of their</i>
<i>favourite brands really really carefully</i>

811
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:02,196
<i>just to see how many chemicals</i>
<i>they have,</i>

812
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:04,830
<i>and then they just sigh</i>
<i>and they put them in their cartanyway,</i>

813
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,797
<i>like they're saying sure</i>
<i>it's bad for me,</i>

814
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:08,598
<i>it's bad for my family but we like it.</i>

815
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:11,955
<i>No one ever thinks</i>
<i>about death in a supermarket.</i>

816
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:46,474
Sixty dollars and forty eight cents.

817
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:51,429
Girls, you finish
those mashed potatoes, okay?

818
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:55,197
Oh, God. Th<i>e</i>se ribs are so great.

819
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:58,678
How did you get them
so tender?

820
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:01,752
I leav<i>e</i> them soaking in my fridge
in milk for a coupl<i>e</i> of hours.

821
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:05,356
You leav<i>e</i> them soaking in milk
in th<i>e</i> fridge for a couple of hours.

822
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:07,838
I must try and remember that.

823
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:10,516
Patsy, stop playing with your food.

824
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:14,352
Ann, t<i>e</i>ll P<i>a</i>tsy to stop playing
with her food.

825
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:17,398
You do what your Dad tells you to do,
okay? Stop playing with your food.

826
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:18,709
Try and e<i>a</i>t a little more.

827
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:20,916
It's more fun pl<i>a</i>ying with it
than eating it.

828
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:22,554
You know

829
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:25,553
that eating food can be fun too?

830
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:26,988
Why?

831
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:28,919
Well because...

832
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:32,315
because you're doing new things,

833
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:35,119
you'r<i>e</i> trying new things
<i>a</i>nd that's fun.

834
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,669
Mashed potatoes isn't new.
It's mor<i>e</i> fun doing things with it.

835
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:40,354
Laurie, why don't you hav<i>e</i>
some more sauce?

836
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:42,078
Here, Don made it himself.

837
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:43,634
Goodness me.

838
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:45,597
I didn't know your husb<i>a</i>nd cooked.

839
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:51,229
I didn't know there w<i>e</i>re husbands
th<i>a</i>t cooked.

840
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:54,033
It w<i>a</i>sn't really cooking.

841
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:55,997
I just added honey
to a bottle of barbecue sauce.

842
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:57,957
Well th<i>a</i>t's better than nothing.

843
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:01,238
You could have lied,
s<i>a</i>id you m<i>a</i>d<i>e</i> the whole thing.

844
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:04,350
No, Don would never li<i>e.</i>
He wouldn't even know how.

845
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:07,998
How did you two guys meet?

846
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,399
We met at a Nirvana concert.

847
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:12,438
Actually
it was the last Nirvana concert

848
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:14,113
before Kurt Cobain...

849
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:15,838
No, my God.

850
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,470
Did you save the tickets?
They must be worth a fortune by now.

851
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:21,239
No, no we didn't save them.

852
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:24,517
No, we were sort of too excited
to keep them.

853
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:26,511
Ann spent the whole concert crying.

854
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:30,035
I didn't re<i>a</i>lly like Nirvana back then,

855
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:32,470
so I was this kind of bored
and I was looking around,

856
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:35,038
and th<i>a</i>t's wh<i>e</i>n I saw Ann.

857
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:39,073
She w<i>a</i>s this beautiful girl
just crying her <i>e</i>yes out,

858
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:42,234
so I went up to her
and I offered her a h<i>a</i>ndkerchief,

859
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:43,958
but I didn't have a handkerchief,

860
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:46,311
I didn't even have a paper one,
so I just...

861
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:49,597
I took off my T-shirt
and I gav<i>e</i> it to her.

862
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:52,754
Thats how we met.

863
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:54,433
That's really romantic.

864
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:59,833
- Do you have any more mash<i>e</i>d potato?
- Yeah, sure.

865
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:05,755
You're a pig.

866
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:10,870
She's basically a nice person,
you know?

867
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:12,155
Oh Christ, Ann.

868
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:13,833
Don't talk so loud.

869
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,353
Penny's right.

870
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:18,076
I mean, the woman ate eight ribs.

871
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:21,038
And they were fucking hug<i>e</i> ribs.
Did you see those things?

872
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:22,189
I know, but...

873
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:24,759
Fucking huge.

874
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:27,275
Her fiance dumped her
the day b<i>e</i>fore her wedding, you know.

875
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:30,716
He invited h<i>e</i>r to an All You Can Eat
and they want<i>e</i>d to charge her triple?

876
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:34,319
Th<i>a</i>t's not funny, Don.
That's not funny.

877
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:37,319
Food can be fun.

878
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:40,397
Food can be fun.

879
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:44,153
Sh<i>e</i>'s a really nice person.

880
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:48,077
Lately she's got this obsession.

881
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:52,110
Yeah, lately you seem to have
the opposite.

882
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:54,556
It's the anaemia.

883
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:57,598
Gonna go get more vitamins this week,
go to the hospit<i>a</i>l.

884
01:01:58,400 --> 01:01:59,799
Do you want me to come with you?

885
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:03,232
No, don't worry, I can m<i>a</i>n<i>a</i>g<i>e.</i>

886
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:05,235
Ok.

887
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:13,790
Tonight I re<i>a</i>liz<i>e</i>d how lucky we were
to me<i>e</i>t that night.

888
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:16,793
I me<i>a</i>n, in spite of everything,

889
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:20,756
in spite of living in this shit hole,

890
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:24,276
in spite of nev<i>e</i>r having anything new,

891
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:27,916
in spite of n<i>e</i>ver going
on vacation.

892
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:33,353
You never complained once,

893
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:36,589
not once.

894
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:45,195
I would...

895
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:51,358
I would like to be better for you.

896
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:05,439
I lov<i>e</i> you, you know that?

897
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:09,759
Don't you ev<i>e</i>r forget that.

898
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:15,074
I love you.

899
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:22,269
Wh<i>a</i>t are you doing?

900
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:23,995
I'm sweeping up.

901
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:27,510
- What <i>a</i>re you doing?
- I'm the queen witch

902
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:30,319
and I'm teaching this little witch
how to make spells.

903
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:32,516
- I'm the littl<i>e</i> witch.
- Really?

904
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:34,636
And what kind of spells
are you doing?

905
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:36,478
Oh, just normal spells,

906
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:40,189
turning frogs into cars
and turning lizards into airplanes.

907
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:42,158
You know how to do th<i>a</i>t?

908
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:43,594
- Are you going to teach me?
- Sure!

909
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:46,310
Hi, there.

910
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:47,549
I'm Ann.

911
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:49,950
I see you've already met
Penny and P<i>a</i>tsy.

912
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:51,678
- Yeah. I'm also Ann.
- Oh yeah?

913
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:53,717
Ther<i>e</i> you go.
Nice to me<i>e</i>t you.

914
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:56,553
- So you just moved in or<i>...</i>?
- Ye<i>a</i>h, a few days ago.

915
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:59,234
I was just trying to do som<i>e</i> gardening
or som<i>e</i>thing.

916
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:01,277
- Looks great.
- They're so swe<i>e</i>t.

917
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:04,518
Their littl<i>e</i> gets ups on.

918
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:05,954
Listen,
this is kind of a weird question

919
01:04:06,120 --> 01:04:07,519
since we just m<i>e</i>t and ev<i>e</i>rything,
but I was wondering,

920
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:10,274
I'm just h<i>e</i>ading out for about half
an hour'cause both my husband

921
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:12,437
and my mom aren't back yet.

922
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:13,953
I was wondering if there was any chance
of you keeping an <i>e</i>ye on them

923
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:15,075
for the n<i>e</i>xt half hour if you're around.

924
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:16,559
- Of course. No problem.
- Ar<i>e</i> you sure?

925
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:18,358
Yeah, I'm going to b<i>e</i> here all day

926
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:20,112
<i>a</i>nd they were going to show me
how to do some spells, so...

927
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:22,475
Ther<i>e</i> you go.
They're v<i>e</i>ry good at spells, so...

928
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:24,119
- Okay.
- Th<i>a</i>nks a lot.

929
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:26,236
Bye, guys.
You b<i>e</i>h<i>a</i>ve yourselves, okay?

930
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:28,871
Ann's gonna watch you for a little bit.

931
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:31,076
- Th<i>a</i>nk you so much.
- It's okay.

932
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:35,914
So, help me here.
Who's Patsy and who's Penny?

933
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:52,873
My body hurt
thinking you w<i>e</i>ren't gonn<i>a</i> come.

934
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:55,148
I w<i>a</i>sn't gonna come.

935
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:58,356
I'm glad you did.

936
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:05,913
Is this one of your sister's tapes?

937
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:06,876
Yeah.

938
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:11,548
Would you like to danc<i>e</i>?

939
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:03,952
...and then the Little Mermaid
said to th<i>e</i> T<i>a</i>xi Driv<i>e</i>r

940
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:06,759
"I wanna se<i>e</i> New York City.
Please, show me New York."

941
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:09,753
'Caus<i>e</i> it's so big. You can't...
you can't just walk around New York.

942
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:12,839
So the t<i>a</i>xi driver took her
to the Empire State Building,

943
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:15,635
and you know it's so high
it has two elevators

944
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:18,155
b<i>e</i>caus<i>e</i> th<i>e</i>y couldn't find
just one cable to build one, you know?

945
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:21,437
They had to build two.
So he got on the first elevator

946
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:24,877
and then on the second <i>e</i>levator
that's as fast as a space rocket,

947
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:27,955
and they got to the top
of th<i>e</i> Empir<i>e</i> State building

948
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:30,715
and th<i>e</i> Little Merm<i>a</i>id w<i>a</i>s looking down
and she said

949
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:33,474
"Oh, my God. Peopl<i>e</i> look like ants,
they're so small..."

950
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:35,631
Hey, guys. Hello, ther<i>e.</i>

951
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:38,633
We played witches and princesses.

952
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:41,236
And Ann did our braids.

953
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:44,073
Oh, they look beautiful. Thank you, Ann.
I'm sorry I took so long.

954
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:46,879
No, that w<i>a</i>s fine.
We had <i>a</i> great time.

955
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:48,951
- Wer<i>e</i> you guys good?
- Yeah.

956
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:52,678
Good. Want your witches hats?

957
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:56,073
Tomorrow can you finish the story
about the m<i>e</i>rmaid

958
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:58,595
- and the taxi driver?
- Of cours<i>e.</i> My pl<i>e</i>asure.

959
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:00,712
Give Ann a kiss goodbye.

960
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:03,759
W<i>e</i> hav<i>e</i> to go have bath
and supper time now,

961
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:06,639
but maybe we can come back
and hear th<i>e e</i>nd of that story, okay?

962
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:09,109
Thank you so much, Ann.
Let's go.

963
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:22,151
- Hey, Ann?
- Yeah?

964
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:24,880
I w<i>a</i>s just going to mak<i>e</i> some coffee.
Do you want to come over?

965
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:25,916
Great.

966
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:27,789
Just let me finish doing this.

967
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:28,950
Okay.

968
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:36,795
- Do you take sugar?
- No, no it's alright.

969
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:40,678
You'r<i>e</i> not on a diet, ar<i>e</i> you?

970
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:42,878
No. Why? Should I?

971
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:46,476
No. I just have this friend
who's obsessed with di<i>e</i>ts

972
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:48,710
and calories and...

973
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:50,029
Boring.

974
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:53,950
No, and I've seen too many p<i>e</i>ople
sick with <i>a</i>norexia and bulimi<i>a.</i>

975
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:56,398
- I'm a nurse. That's why.
- Is th<i>a</i>t so?

976
01:07:57,120 --> 01:07:59,076
So I'm not r<i>e</i>ally bothered.

977
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:03,119
You know, you've got re<i>a</i>lly cute kids.

978
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:05,232
Yeah, they're great, aren't they?

979
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:08,796
What <i>a</i>bout you? You want kids?

980
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:10,553
No, I don't think so.

981
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:14,471
Why not? I mean,

982
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:17,400
you think it's stupid
to bring them into the world, or...?

983
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:19,630
Just haven't found
the right guy, or...?

984
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:21,959
No, I haven't.

985
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:24,358
No, but it's not that either, no.

986
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:27,111
Do you think you can't?

987
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:30,839
No. Well,

988
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:32,870
I don't know, actu<i>a</i>lly.

989
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:40,915
But...

990
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:45,911
I was in my last year
of nursing college.

991
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:48,878
We were doing some work experience
in a paediatric hospital.

992
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:53,191
I'd decided to specialize in kids,
because I've alw<i>a</i>ys liked them.

993
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:57,875
Maybe because I was <i>a</i>n only child.

994
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:00,109
I don't know. Anyw<i>a</i>y,

995
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:02,829
one night I was on duty,

996
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,991
<i>a</i>nd they called me in
to help with a birth.

997
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:07,196
This woman was overdue,

998
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:10,079
sh<i>e</i> was expecting twins,
and the babies were in danger.

999
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:15,388
So they decided to do
a caesarean

1000
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:18,793
and the moth<i>e</i>r was put
under a gener<i>a</i>l <i>a</i>naesthetic.

1001
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:21,789
And...

1002
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:26,515
it turned out they were Siam<i>e</i>se twins.

1003
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:30,597
They w<i>e</i>re born without one torso...
on<i>e</i> set of lungs...

1004
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:31,988
they hardly cried.

1005
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:35,351
They w<i>e</i>ren't horribl<i>e</i> to look at.

1006
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:38,035
No, th<i>e</i>y were just lik<i>e a</i>ny other baby.

1007
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:41,636
But

1008
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:44,636
ther<i>e</i> was no way
they were going to survive.

1009
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:46,475
It's impossible.

1010
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:52,316
So we put them in an incubator
while the doctors talked to the f<i>a</i>ther

1011
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:53,879
about what they should do.

1012
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:57,191
The father didn't even wanna see them.

1013
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:03,588
So they d<i>e</i>cided to take them out
of the incubator

1014
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:07,993
and wait for them to di<i>e.</i>

1015
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:10,193
And I off<i>e</i>red

1016
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:12,477
to be with them until they...

1017
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:15,074
I couldn't bear the thought of them
dying alone

1018
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:16,832
in a cold hospital room.

1019
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:22,113
They lived thirty hours.

1020
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:27,429
I held them in my arms thirty hours.

1021
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:32,555
I sang <i>e</i>very song I knew,

1022
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:36,236
songs from the world
they could never see, but...

1023
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:42,228
Anyway, th<i>e</i>y just grew smaller
and smaller in my arms.

1024
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:44,193
First the boy di<i>e</i>d, and...

1025
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:49,711
six hours later the girl died.

1026
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:57,637
So... sinc<i>e</i> then I've speci<i>a</i>liz<i>e</i>d
in geri<i>a</i>tric nursing.

1027
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:05,759
I'm so sorry, Ann.

1028
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:09,990
I don't know
why I told you this story.

1029
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:11,798
Th<i>a</i>nks for the coffee.

1030
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:14,394
You know what? I b<i>e</i>tter be going.
No, I'm sorry.

1031
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:16,869
Do you want to come over
for dinner next we<i>e</i>k?

1032
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:21,712
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, no, I would really love you to.

1033
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:24,591
I know th<i>e</i> girls
would r<i>e</i>ally lov<i>e</i> it too,

1034
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:26,877
b<i>e</i>caus<i>e</i> you hav<i>e</i> to tell them
the end of that m<i>e</i>rmaid story,

1035
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:28,234
they love that story.

1036
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:32,679
I'd love to, Ann.

1037
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:34,992
And you know,
that story is happy.

1038
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:39,640
Thank you so much,
I'd love to.

1039
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:45,589
Read me something.

1040
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:47,836
Read m<i>e</i> something
that you're reading right now.

1041
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,798
I'm reading a very sad book
at the moment.

1042
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:53,919
Beautiful, but sad.

1043
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:57,869
It can't be as sad
as the story I h<i>e</i>ard today.

1044
01:11:58,480 --> 01:11:59,515
Tell it to me.

1045
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:01,275
I can't.

1046
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:02,959
It'll make me too sad.

1047
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:06,032
You don't wanna tell it to me
because its part of your life,

1048
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:09,628
<i>a</i>nd you don't want me to know
anything about your lif<i>e.</i>

1049
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:12,394
I like it that you don't ask me
anything about my life.

1050
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:16,479
I don't ask you anything
because I've learned not to.

1051
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:20,878
When you look at som<i>e</i>body,

1052
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:23,469
you might see

1053
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:27,188
fifty per cent

1054
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:29,915
of who they ar<i>e</i>,

1055
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:34,910
and w<i>a</i>nting to know the rest,
that's what destroys <i>e</i>verything.

1056
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:37,359
That's what I learnt.

1057
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:40,637
Whoever took away your furniture
really t<i>a</i>ught you a lesson, eh?

1058
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:43,397
That's all she left me.

1059
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:50,959
- You really want me to read you som<i>e</i>thing?
- Please.

1060
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:53,388
Read me something.

1061
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:54,755
Okay.

1062
01:12:57,320 --> 01:12:58,435
Pick something.

1063
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:02,710
"To the Wedding"
by John B<i>e</i>rger.

1064
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:23,116
"Her capacities go out one by one,

1065
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:26,158
and there's no night,

1066
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:28,113
no stars,

1067
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:32,159
only a cell<i>a</i>r from which
she c<i>a</i>n never w<i>a</i>lk

1068
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:34,789
and which nobody <i>e</i>lse
can stay.

1069
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:39,478
She's given medicines
which mak<i>e</i> her ill,

1070
01:13:40,280 --> 01:13:42,271
but would stop her dying.

1071
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:44,109
For a little while.

1072
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:46,710
They're scared.
I'm scar<i>e</i>d."

1073
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:54,997
You know, I don't think it was that bad.

1074
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:57,239
No, I like it.

1075
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:00,278
Ljust don't want to read right now.

1076
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:15,508
I lied.

1077
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:21,270
When I said that when you look at
somebody you know fifty per cent.

1078
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:25,796
I guess when I look at you I see,

1079
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:29,274
I don't know, maybe ten per cent...

1080
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:34,479
and that ten per cent is...

1081
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:44,468
It's not so bad. Is it?

1082
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:06,074
It's my birthday today.
Wish me a happy birthday.

1083
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:07,874
Happy birthday, mom.

1084
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:15,152
Aren't you going to start the c<i>a</i>r?

1085
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:18,198
I've got something to tell you, Mom.

1086
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:22,830
It must be serious, otherwise
you'd tell me while you were driving.

1087
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:27,470
I n<i>e</i>ed to know
where my Dad is.

1088
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:29,594
Are you going to go and see him?

1089
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:33,148
B<i>e</i>caus<i>e</i> that bugs you?

1090
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:36,750
No,

1091
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:40,471
not even that c<i>a</i>n m<i>a</i>ke m<i>e</i> mad <i>a</i>nymore.

1092
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:47,959
This time last year,

1093
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:50,078
this v<i>e</i>ry sam<i>e</i> day,
my birthday,

1094
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:53,553
I thought I should do something,
I don't know why.

1095
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:57,109
So I... I put on some m<i>a</i>keup

1096
01:15:57,480 --> 01:15:59,675
and the least old clothes
I could find

1097
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:01,273
and I w<i>e</i>nt to a bar.

1098
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:03,992
And I ordered a whisky

1099
01:16:05,080 --> 01:16:07,230
and start<i>e</i>d t<i>a</i>lking to
the bartender.

1100
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:10,432
He was just a kid,

1101
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:14,629
he'd just started at the hot<i>e</i>l,
it was his first job,

1102
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:19,630
and we chatt<i>e</i>d about this and th<i>a</i>t,

1103
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:21,631
and I told him it was my birthday.

1104
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,592
About five minutes later

1105
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:30,310
he pr<i>e</i>sented me with a bowl of peanuts
with a candle in.

1106
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:32,915
And I...

1107
01:16:33,720 --> 01:16:35,199
I start<i>e</i>d to cry.

1108
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:38,630
I cried so hard the kid got scared,

1109
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:43,677
<i>a</i>nd he blew out the candl<i>e</i>,
and hid th<i>e</i> bowl of pe<i>a</i>nuts,

1110
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:47,512
and I said
"No, don't blow out the candle.

1111
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:49,238
Don't hide th<i>e</i> pe<i>a</i>nuts."

1112
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:52,000
And all this year,
all I could think about was

1113
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:55,312
that bowl of peanuts
and how I started to cry.

1114
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:59,550
So this y<i>e</i>ar,
I baked myself a cake.

1115
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:04,396
'Cause I knew if I w<i>e</i>nt back to that bar,
I'd give that kid a h<i>e</i>art attack.

1116
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:16,589
Start the car.

1117
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:27,556
Five minutes.

1118
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:30,758
You're almost don<i>e</i>, too.

1119
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:34,235
- Am I hurting you?
- No, not at all.

1120
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:35,674
She's gre<i>a</i>t with nails.

1121
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:38,798
Now, don't you ask h<i>e</i>r to give you
a perm or braids or anything,

1122
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:41,030
but with nails, she's th<i>e</i> best.

1123
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:44,355
I've got a manicure diplom<i>a</i>

1124
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:47,880
and ev<i>e</i>rything. I'm not interested
in hair or heads.

1125
01:17:48,280 --> 01:17:49,872
Give me hands every tim<i>e.</i>

1126
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:52,396
So do you like Milli Vanilli as well?

1127
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:56,595
I'm from Segovi<i>a.</i> We don't have
any Mili Vanilli in Segovia.

1128
01:17:57,480 --> 01:17:59,391
Milli Vanilli is univers<i>a</i>l.

1129
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:02,072
- Thank you very much.
- Thanks.

1130
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:04,718
So, see you soon.

1131
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:06,875
No.

1132
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:08,476
No?

1133
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:11,276
You know,

1134
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:14,314
braids really suit you.
They look really great on you.

1135
01:18:16,040 --> 01:18:17,155
You think so?

1136
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:18,756
Yeah.

1137
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:22,198
Bye.

1138
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:10,310
Hi...

1139
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:14,156
Hi.

1140
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:16,839
How are you, Ann?

1141
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:26,318
This is Penny and this is Patsy.

1142
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:29,111
P<i>e</i>nny's six and Patsy's four.

1143
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:32,392
Th<i>e</i>y're very pr<i>e</i>tty young girls.

1144
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:34,552
You hav<i>e</i>n't b<i>e</i>en wasting your time.

1145
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:36,554
You could say that.

1146
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:39,433
What <i>a</i>bout your husband?

1147
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:40,955
Don?

1148
01:19:42,240 --> 01:19:43,912
Ah, he builds swimming pools.

1149
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:45,559
Swimming pools, no less?

1150
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:47,279
Y<i>e</i>ah, he's doing pretty good.

1151
01:19:48,680 --> 01:19:50,238
I got work here, you know.

1152
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:54,078
Sewing sports shoes together.

1153
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:58,348
You know, a sports sho<i>e</i> can take up to
86 diff<i>e</i>rent pieces. Did you know that?

1154
01:19:58,840 --> 01:19:59,511
No.

1155
01:20:00,040 --> 01:20:02,349
We sew the side pieces on here,
and then

1156
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:04,596
in another jail they finish th<i>e</i>m off.

1157
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:07,869
It's good work.

1158
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:09,475
Sure.

1159
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:12,152
People are always gonna want to
ne<i>e</i>d shoes, huh?

1160
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:21,150
Ann, I suppose your mother
still hates me.

1161
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:23,552
Dad, Mom hates everyone.

1162
01:20:23,720 --> 01:20:25,836
Y<i>e</i>ah, I bet she hat<i>e</i>s me
the most.

1163
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:27,428
Sometim<i>e</i>s, yeah.

1164
01:20:31,880 --> 01:20:33,074
Some of us...

1165
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:38,151
just can't live th<i>e</i> kind of life
that other p<i>e</i>ople want us to live.

1166
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:45,751
No matter how hard you try,

1167
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:48,429
you just can't do it.

1168
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:49,995
I guess.

1169
01:20:51,560 --> 01:20:53,676
- You believe me, don't you?
- Yeah.

1170
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:55,835
I b<i>e</i>lieve you.

1171
01:20:56,840 --> 01:20:57,875
It's hard.

1172
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:03,675
Like you know

1173
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:06,874
you love som<i>e</i>one
and you can't make them happy.

1174
01:21:10,640 --> 01:21:13,438
It's kind of lik<i>e</i> you love them, but...

1175
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:19,028
you can't love them
the way they wanna be loved,

1176
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:19,871
you know wh<i>a</i>t I me<i>a</i>n?

1177
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:24,790
If you send me the kids' shoes sizes,
I can make some shoes for them.

1178
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:27,109
Okay.

1179
01:21:32,440 --> 01:21:33,839
I want to touch your fac<i>e.</i>

1180
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:40,319
I remember how it us<i>e</i>d to feel.

1181
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:44,354
I've forgotten a lot of things.
I remember that.

1182
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:46,028
I remember,

1183
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:50,714
you used to before you'd leave th<i>e</i> house
you'd put on this record of ringing b<i>e</i>lls

1184
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:53,832
and then you'd just leave
the hous<i>e</i> like right away.

1185
01:21:55,880 --> 01:21:57,791
I used to like to hear
the music from the house

1186
01:21:57,960 --> 01:21:59,632
as I was walking down th<i>e</i> street.

1187
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:02,753
It was re<i>a</i>lly pretty.

1188
01:22:03,680 --> 01:22:04,590
It was?

1189
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:06,913
It w<i>a</i>s always the same record.

1190
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:09,078
It was the Mule Ser<i>e</i>nade.

1191
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:12,719
It was re<i>a</i>lly pretty.

1192
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:22,072
T<i>a</i>ke c<i>a</i>re of yourself, Dad, okay?

1193
01:22:23,960 --> 01:22:24,995
Yeah, you too.

1194
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:29,559
And r<i>e</i>memb<i>e</i>r to send me
the girls' shoe sizes, okay?

1195
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:31,229
Yeah, I will.

1196
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:01,189
Going to hav<i>e</i> a good d<i>a</i>y
at school? Giv<i>e</i> me a kiss.

1197
01:23:02,720 --> 01:23:04,392
Okay, hav<i>e a</i> good day.

1198
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:08,916
I hope you feel better, Mommy.
I want you to feel better, y<i>e</i>ah.

1199
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:12,115
- Okay. You have <i>a</i> good day, all right?
- Bye.

1200
01:23:14,040 --> 01:23:15,075
Hey, Patsy.

1201
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:19,352
- Give me a cuddl<i>e</i>, Mommy.
- I'll giv<i>e</i> you <i>a</i> cuddle.

1202
01:23:20,040 --> 01:23:22,190
- How's that for a cuddle?
- Okay.

1203
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:25,793
- I need to go now.
- You hav<i>e</i> to go to school now?

1204
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:28,554
Okay. I know,
you're in a bit of a hurry.

1205
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:36,592
Ar<i>e</i> you sure this is anaemia?

1206
01:23:37,360 --> 01:23:39,078
Maybe w<i>e</i> should go see
another doctor?

1207
01:23:39,240 --> 01:23:41,913
No, I know it's anaemia.
They did lik<i>e a</i> million tests

1208
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:45,432
and I've been taking all th<i>e</i> vitamins.
They just told me I need to r<i>e</i>st.

1209
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:48,396
I took car<i>e</i> of all of you guys
when you were sick,

1210
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:49,993
it's your turn to t<i>a</i>ke care of me.

1211
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:51,150
Okay.

1212
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:53,351
I think I'm going to lik<i>e</i>
taking care of you.

1213
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:55,750
Y<i>e</i>ah? Let's see
if you're any good at it.

1214
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:05,909
Okay. By<i>e.</i>

1215
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:11,989
Don,

1216
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:16,192
I want you to understand
why I didn't tell you I was goinna die.

1217
01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:19,909
It was like...

1218
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:26,156
It was like the only pr<i>e</i>sent
I could give you and the girls,

1219
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:30,157
to sav<i>e</i> you all th<i>e</i> trips to the hospital
and all th<i>e</i> stress

1220
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:32,954
and the waiting around in waiting rooms
and I know if you think about it,

1221
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:34,155
you'll know th<i>a</i>t I'm right.

1222
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:37,759
Now you hav<i>e</i> to be h<i>a</i>ppy,

1223
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:43,112
and you have to look aft<i>e</i>r the girls,
you have to make them happy too.

1224
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:48,551
Dream up a heaven for me.

1225
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:53,234
Don't let them be sad
when they remember me.

1226
01:24:53,720 --> 01:24:56,712
You just remind them
of all the gre<i>a</i>t things we did together.

1227
01:25:01,080 --> 01:25:02,274
I love you, Don.

1228
01:25:03,960 --> 01:25:07,919
You'll alw<i>a</i>ys b<i>e</i> the guy who took off
his T-shirt to wipe aw<i>a</i>y my tears...

1229
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:38,713
Sorry it's so out of key.

1230
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:41,155
It alw<i>a</i>ys kind of was, though.

1231
01:25:48,040 --> 01:25:49,075
Hi, Mom.

1232
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:52,077
W<i>e</i>ll, I gu<i>e</i>ss you're never
going to forgive me

1233
01:25:52,240 --> 01:25:53,798
for not telling you
I was going to die.

1234
01:25:56,160 --> 01:25:59,072
So, it's just one mor<i>e</i> thing to bl<i>a</i>me
the world for, I guess.

1235
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:01,754
<i>I love you.</i>

1236
01:26:02,720 --> 01:26:04,073
<i>I know you love me.</i>

1237
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:06,992
I know you adore the girls,

1238
01:26:09,240 --> 01:26:10,434
so please

1239
01:26:11,560 --> 01:26:12,675
tell them that.

1240
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:17,916
Try and show like you love them
just a little bit every day.

1241
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:21,472
And try to enjoy lif<i>e</i>,

1242
01:26:21,640 --> 01:26:22,959
you know, a little, just a little bit.

1243
01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:26,476
I me<i>a</i>n, maybe at some point
you could go on a d<i>a</i>te.

1244
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:27,709
That would be fun,

1245
01:26:27,880 --> 01:26:30,394
or you could put an ad
in th<i>e</i> paper or anything.

1246
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:32,596
I just think
you could hav<i>e a</i> little fun.

1247
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:35,274
You're really beautiful
and you've got a great heart

1248
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:37,839
and just try

1249
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:40,318
<i>a</i>nd enjoy stuff more.

1250
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:43,199
<i>Please help Don.</i>

1251
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:48,868
You can tell the girls
any stories you like,

1252
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:50,871
even Joan Cr<i>a</i>wford movies.

1253
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:16,389
Your sister really knows
how to pick a song, hey.

1254
01:27:17,640 --> 01:27:19,835
- You like it?
- Yeah, it's great.

1255
01:27:20,160 --> 01:27:22,116
It's Blossom Dearie.
You ever heard of her?

1256
01:27:22,280 --> 01:27:23,269
No. Wh<i>a</i>t's that?

1257
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,594
Blossom Dearie?
Oh, she's amazing.

1258
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:29,236
Sh<i>e</i>'s still singing
and she's 83 years old.

1259
01:27:29,680 --> 01:27:30,795
83?

1260
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:33,190
And she plays in this little club

1261
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:36,320
behind a Chinese lounge

1262
01:27:36,760 --> 01:27:37,988
and

1263
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:40,390
she has this tiny little voice,

1264
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:43,559
this tiny little body
and such personality and...

1265
01:27:43,720 --> 01:27:46,393
- 83.
- Ye<i>a</i>h, she's 83.

1266
01:27:47,680 --> 01:27:49,318
I'd lov<i>e</i> to take you there.

1267
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:01,235
Ann, there's so many places
I'd like to take you.

1268
01:28:01,560 --> 01:28:03,710
Tell me about all the plac<i>e</i>s
you'd like to take me.

1269
01:28:05,360 --> 01:28:06,236
Okay.

1270
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,116
In the south of Chile,
there's a desert,

1271
01:28:10,760 --> 01:28:12,193
it's stunning,

1272
01:28:12,520 --> 01:28:15,910
pur<i>e</i> white and flat
as far as the eye can see

1273
01:28:16,160 --> 01:28:19,072
and the only thing that br<i>e</i>aks
the lin<i>e</i> of the horizon

1274
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:22,637
ar<i>e</i> these robin-egg
blue little houses

1275
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:25,270
and in the morning,
the sky goes

1276
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:26,919
completely gre<i>e</i>n.

1277
01:28:27,680 --> 01:28:29,033
It's unworldly.

1278
01:28:29,960 --> 01:28:32,554
And in Argentina,

1279
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:35,349
<i>a</i> glacier lake,

1280
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:38,672
and in the spring
when the thaw com<i>e</i>s on,

1281
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:43,671
these huge blocks of ice,
I mean huge,

1282
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:45,239
the size of apartment buildings,

1283
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:47,311
com<i>e</i> sliding off the glacier
into the lake

1284
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:51,950
and then your he<i>a</i>rt is pounding out
of your chest, it's terrifying.

1285
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:55,874
And Mexico and Al<i>a</i>sk<i>a...</i>

1286
01:28:56,520 --> 01:28:57,475
Are you OK?

1287
01:28:59,160 --> 01:29:00,354
What's the matt<i>e</i>r?

1288
01:29:01,960 --> 01:29:03,598
I'm not going to see thes<i>e</i> places.

1289
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:06,715
What is it?

1290
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:08,074
What's the matt<i>e</i>r?

1291
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:11,594
You don't wanna tell me?

1292
01:29:12,120 --> 01:29:13,838
I'm so sorry, Lee.

1293
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:18,317
- I really need to get out of here.
- Okay.

1294
01:29:21,680 --> 01:29:23,875
Waiter!
Can I get the check?

1295
01:29:24,760 --> 01:29:25,715
Thank you.

1296
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:28,757
I always wanted to come her<i>e.</i>

1297
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:33,874
Could you get th<i>e</i>m to put this
in a doggy bag for me?

1298
01:29:34,640 --> 01:29:35,629
Sure.

1299
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,069
Thanks.

1300
01:29:39,080 --> 01:29:40,752
Okay, I'll meet you outsid<i>e</i>, okay?

1301
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,479
You have to go.

1302
01:30:15,400 --> 01:30:18,358
He's gonna be here any minut<i>e.</i>
He works nearby.

1303
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:23,236
It's b<i>e</i>tter if he comes and picks me up.
This happens occasionally, so...

1304
01:30:28,040 --> 01:30:30,838
Ann, there's something that I have
to tell you, and I have to tell you now.

1305
01:30:31,680 --> 01:30:32,590
I love you.

1306
01:30:35,080 --> 01:30:36,752
I'm in love with you...

1307
01:30:38,480 --> 01:30:41,517
<i>a</i>nd the world seems less terrible
because you exist.

1308
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:46,910
I feel like I w<i>a</i>nna be with you
for the rest of my lif<i>e</i>,

1309
01:30:47,080 --> 01:30:49,548
and all that, the p<i>a</i>lpitations,
and the nerves,

1310
01:30:49,720 --> 01:30:53,030
and the pain, and the happiness,
and the fe<i>a</i>r...

1311
01:30:56,200 --> 01:30:57,235
I wanna...

1312
01:30:57,640 --> 01:30:59,756
I wanna touch you all the time.

1313
01:31:00,360 --> 01:31:02,590
I wann<i>a</i> tak<i>e</i> care of you,
and your girls and...

1314
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:06,469
and even find your husband
a decent job and get you a house

1315
01:31:06,640 --> 01:31:09,598
- th<i>a</i>t doesn't have wheels <i>a</i>nd...
- Careful.

1316
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:13,029
That sounds like a classic case
of falling in lov<i>e.</i>

1317
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:14,829
I am in lov<i>e.</i>

1318
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:18,277
I'm classically in love.

1319
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:22,718
The cl<i>a</i>ssic husband
who's gonna be her<i>e a</i>ny minute,

1320
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:26,510
and th<i>e</i> classic d<i>e</i>pression that sets
in every time you go off with him,

1321
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:28,713
and the crying

1322
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:30,990
and the te<i>a</i>rs and everything.

1323
01:31:53,400 --> 01:31:54,469
I'll go.

1324
01:31:57,200 --> 01:32:00,237
Though I don't want to see you
driving off with som<i>e</i> guy, you know?

1325
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:01,913
Someon<i>e</i> you don't know.

1326
01:32:03,400 --> 01:32:04,674
So, I'll be watching.

1327
01:32:07,200 --> 01:32:09,111
Unl<i>e</i>ss of course it's your husband.

1328
01:33:57,760 --> 01:33:59,193
Ann, I fe<i>e</i>l terrible.

1329
01:33:59,560 --> 01:34:01,949
I invited you over to dinner
and now you have to do all the work.

1330
01:34:02,200 --> 01:34:04,350
That's okay,
ljust have to h<i>e</i>at up this.

1331
01:34:05,760 --> 01:34:06,476
So I still don't understand

1332
01:34:06,640 --> 01:34:08,232
why you had to go to th<i>e</i> restaurant
in your condition...

1333
01:34:08,440 --> 01:34:10,556
I told you I thought
I w<i>a</i>s fe<i>e</i>ling better.

1334
01:34:10,920 --> 01:34:14,117
A bad cas<i>e</i> of anaemia isn't something
you should take lightly. You should rest.

1335
01:34:14,280 --> 01:34:15,508
Yes, listen to Nurse Ann, Ann.

1336
01:34:20,320 --> 01:34:21,594
And you know what?

1337
01:34:23,040 --> 01:34:25,508
I think you could go wash your hands,
'cause this is ready.

1338
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:27,193
Go wash up, girls.

1339
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:32,035
- Don...
- Yeah?

1340
01:34:32,200 --> 01:34:35,317
- You too.
- All right, yes ma'am.

1341
01:34:37,080 --> 01:34:39,719
<i>You pray that this will be</i>
<i>your life without you...</i>

1342
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:41,950
<i>you pray that the girls</i>
<i>will love this woman</i>

1343
01:34:42,120 --> 01:34:43,235
<i>who has the same name as you,</i>

1344
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:46,755
<i>and that your husband</i>
<i>will end up loving her too,</i>

1345
01:34:47,080 --> 01:34:49,799
<i>and that they can live in the house</i>
<i>next door, and the girls can play</i>

1346
01:34:49,960 --> 01:34:52,554
<i>doll houses in the trailer,</i>
<i>and barely remember their mother</i>

<i>who used to sleep during the day,</i>
<i>and take them on raft rides in bed.</i>

1348
01:34:56,880 --> 01:34:59,872
<i>You pray that they will have moments</i>
<i>of happiness so intense</i>

1349
01:35:00,080 --> 01:35:03,231
<i>that all of their problems</i>
<i>will seem insignificant in comparison.</i>

1350
01:35:04,040 --> 01:35:07,077
<i>You don't know who or what</i>
<i>you're praying to, but you pray.</i>

1351
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:11,918
<i>You don't even regret the life</i>
<i>that you're not gonna have,</i>

1352
01:35:12,760 --> 01:35:14,318
<i>because by then</i>
<i>you'll be dead,</i>

1353
01:35:15,040 --> 01:35:16,792
<i>and the dead don't feel anything,</i>

1354
01:35:17,040 --> 01:35:18,473
<i>not even regret.</i>

1355
01:35:28,120 --> 01:35:29,473
<i>My darling Lee,</i>

1356
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:33,679
<i>I guess by the time you get this tape</i>
<i>you'll know that I'm dead</i>

1357
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:37,799
<i>and, well, all that...</i>

1358
01:35:39,720 --> 01:35:43,474
<i>Maybe you're angry with me,</i>
<i>or hurt or sad or upset</i>

1359
01:35:43,680 --> 01:35:44,999
<i>or maybe you're all of it together.</i>

1360
01:35:47,280 --> 01:35:49,111
<i>I just want you to know</i>
<i>that I fell in love with you.</i>

1361
01:35:51,360 --> 01:35:53,237
<i>I didn't dare tell you 'cause</i>

1362
01:35:54,720 --> 01:35:56,950
<i>I thought you kind of knew,</i>

1363
01:35:57,320 --> 01:35:59,993
<i>and I didn't realize</i>
<i>I had so little time.</i>

1364
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:04,470
<i>Actually, time is the one thing</i>
<i>I haven't had enough of recently.</i>

1365
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:08,276
<i>Life is so much better</i>
<i>than you think, my love.</i>

1366
01:36:10,360 --> 01:36:11,634
<i>I know, because</i>

1367
01:36:12,360 --> 01:36:14,828
<i>you managed to fall in love with me</i>
<i>even though you saw,</i>

1368
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,514
<i>what was it,</i>
<i>you said ten per cent?</i>

1369
01:36:18,840 --> 01:36:20,034
<i>Five maybe?</i>

1370
01:36:22,600 --> 01:36:25,114
<i>Maybe if you'd seen it all,</i>
<i>you wouldn't have liked me.</i>

1371
01:36:26,840 --> 01:36:29,354
<i>Or you would have liked me</i>
<i>in spite of everything.</i>

1372
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:32,479
<i>I guess we'll never know.</i>

1373
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,355
<i>Oh, and one last thing... Lee,</i>
<i>for God's sake</i>

1374
01:36:36,920 --> 01:36:40,117
<i>just paint your walls</i>
<i>and buy some furniture.</i>

1375
01:36:40,720 --> 01:36:43,234
<i>Alright? I don't want</i>
<i>the next woman you take home</i>

1376
01:36:43,400 --> 01:36:44,469
<i>to get the wrong idea about you</i>

1377
01:36:44,640 --> 01:36:46,915
<i>and run off before she gets</i>
<i>a chance to know you.</i>

1378
01:36:48,760 --> 01:36:51,274
<i>Not everyone's as crazy</i>
<i>as I am.</i>

1379
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:53,352
<i>I loved dancing with you.</i>
