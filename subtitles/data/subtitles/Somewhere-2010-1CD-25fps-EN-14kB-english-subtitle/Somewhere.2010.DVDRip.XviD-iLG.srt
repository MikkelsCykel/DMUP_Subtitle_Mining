1
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,900
- Sammy, you're coming?
- Where's that little midget waiter dude?

2
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,500
- What?
- The little midget waiter.

3
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,300
- Oh, shit!
- That was funny.

4
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,800
You always trip like that.

5
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,000
Fuck.

6
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,800
Hey, Johnny, doing okay?

7
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,100
Great. Thanks.

8
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,200
I think he is.

9
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,600
He's cute.

10
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,600
That was great.

11
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,000
Come here, Bambi.

12
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,900
I'm Cindy, you moron.

13
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,400
I'm sorry, Cindy.

14
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,900
I'm the other one.

15
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,600
Hmm.

16
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,800
Hi, Dad.

17
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,100
Hey, Cleo.

18
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,100
Hi, Johnny.

19
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,600
Hey, Layla.

20
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,000
What happened to you?

21
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,300
Ah, just a little stunt work.

22
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,500
You know, I do all my own stunts.

23
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,500
Don't get her back too late, okay?

24
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,000
Yeah, sure.

25
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,400
I like this, my first signature.

26
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,300
- Thanks.
- This is cool.

27
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,800
- You see that?
- What?

28
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,600
The black SUV behind us.
I think he's following us.

29
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,900
Does he have any cameras?

30
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,000
It just looks like a car.

31
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,200
Watch your line. Step back.

32
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,300
And remember to keep yourself square, okay?

33
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,500
Play the music.

34
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,400
You're really good.

35
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,200
Thanks.

36
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,500
When did you learn how to ice skate?

37
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I've been going for three years.

38
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,100
Really?

39
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,200
Is that the same SUV?

40
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,800
There's kind of a lot of those in LA.

41
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,600
Yeah, but I think that's the same one.
I've seen it.

42
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:50,100
- What are you doing?
- I'm taking down the plates.

43
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,600
Nice. Good thinking.

44
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,800
- Bye, kiddo.
- Bye.

45
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,800
Got it?

46
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,100
Hi.

47
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,800
Hey, Johnny, we're having a party.

48
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,100
- Yeah, it looks great.
- Thanks.

49
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,800
Hey, man, how are ya?

50
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,300
- Cheers.
- Johnny.

51
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,800
There's this documentary, it's amazing.
it's called The F Word.

52
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:38,400
People saying "fuck" on TV in America.
It was this video and stuff.

53
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:44,100
And it's about $200,000 fine in the US
if you say it on TV.

54
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,400
Thanks.

55
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,500
Cool.

56
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,400
Yeah. So how many times do you go?

57
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,700
MAN 22 You like it, I like it.

58
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,900
I love you. Oh, I really love you.

59
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,900
They've to go straight for door number two.

60
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,800
Hi.

61
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,100
Hi.

62
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,200
Oh, hey. Hey, Johnny. I'm sorry.

63
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,300
Sorry.

64
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,900
Hey, I don't want to bother you.
I just wanted to...

65
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:10,100
I'm an actor and I just wanted to ask you
a couple of questions.

66
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,300
- Spitball and stuff, you know.
- Yeah. Go for it.

67
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:15,700
Um...
So, did you study formally?

68
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,200
Study? No, I didn't really.

69
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,000
No? Really? Really?

70
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,900
So you don't do, like, method and stuff,
or anything like that?

71
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,200
Method acting?

72
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,200
- Yeah. You know, like...
- I don't really follow...

73
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:27,900
I don't really follow
a particular method or anything.

74
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:31,800
I just, really, I started and I got an agent
and auditioned and stuff.

75
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:32,800
Yeah. Cool.

76
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,100
- But stick with it, all right?
- Yeah.

77
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,300
- You can do it, man.
- Okay.

78
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,100
- All right, homie.
- Thank you.

79
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,600
Hi. I'm Johnny.

80
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,600
Hi, Johnny.

81
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,600
Ah, come here. Come here.

82
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,300
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

83
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,200
Johnny.

84
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,800
Oh, my cast is stuck.

85
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,100
Kiss me, kiss me.

86
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,200
- You're a good kisser, Johnny.
- Yeah?

87
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,100
Oh, boy!

88
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,000
Kiss me, please.

89
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,600
- Oh, Johnny.
- Oh, my God. That's...

90
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,700
Oh, yeah.

91
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,400
It tickles.

92
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:33,500
Where are your panties? Oh, here they are.

93
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,600
Okay.

94
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,900
Okay.

95
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,700
Oh, boy.

96
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,600
Johnny.

97
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,100
Johnny?

98
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,700
Johnny?

99
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,400
- Hello.
Good morning, Johnny.

100
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,600
Oh, hey, Marge.

101
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,300
Your car's waiting downstairs.

102
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,400
For what?

103
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,700
The junket at the Four Seasons.

104
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,700
Oh, right.

105
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:09,900
Claire will meet you in the lobby
to take you up when you get there.

106
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,300
Okay, I need, like, five minutes.
Give me a second.

107
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,400
Hi, Johnny. How are you?
You look amazing. Oh, my gosh.

108
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,600
Hey, Johnny, Paul Metcalf. Universal.
Thanks for coming.

109
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,500
- Hi, I'm Jane Amrow from Universal.
- Hi.

110
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:27,800
Great, great. Okay, we're going to go upstairs
for a photo with Rebecca.

111
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:28,800
Okay.

112
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,700
Okay. Then we're going to go down
for a press conference.

113
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:33,300
I'll be right there.
If you don't know the answer, I do.

114
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,300
Do you want something to drink?
We're going to go this way.

115
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,600
- I'm good right now.
- Coffee or water?

116
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:40,600
Rebecca, Johnny, can you just move
a little bit closer together there?

117
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,800
- Sure.
- Put your arm around...

118
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,000
That's great.

119
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,800
Big smile.

120
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,700
That's it, straight to camera.

121
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,400
Let's check those.

122
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,200
- You look great.
- Thanks.

123
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,300
I was being sarcastic.

124
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,100
You good?

125
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,800
Yeah, good to go.
- Okay.

126
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,200
And big smiles.

127
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:07,000
Can I get you to look towards each other
and smile?

128
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,900
That's it. That's it. And back to camera.

129
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,200
That's it. Great. Let me just test these.

130
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,400
Is that it?

131
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,100
PHOTOGRAPHERS And...

132
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,500
Big smiles.

133
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,400
And we're good. Thank you.

134
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,000
It wasn't even that good.

135
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,300
- So are we good?
- Yeah.

136
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,800
That was awesome!

137
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,800
Okay, ready for the press conference?

138
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,100
- Yes. Great.
- You're gonna follow me.

139
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,400
Do you need anything to drink?

140
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,500
- Are you okay till we get there? Okay.
No, I'm great.

141
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,700
I'm just going to be right over here.

142
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,300
MALE REPORTER II Johnny.
FEMALE REPORTER III Hi, Johnny.

143
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,500
Hi, everybody.

144
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,600
How do you think
this role represents Italian-Americans?

145
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,900
She always goes first.

146
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,500
Would you like to go to China?

147
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,700
Yes.

148
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,600
You have many fans there.

149
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,100
Hi, Johnny. You're always in good shape.

150
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,100
Can you share your workout secrets with us?

151
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,600
I'm asking because I'm writing my next book
for Russia

152
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,700
on workout secrets of Hollywood stars.

153
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,900
Oh.

154
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,800
Just basics.

155
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,900
This film has a
reflection of today's post-modern globalism?

156
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,200
I'm sorry, what was the question again?

157
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,300
Who's Cleo on your cast?

158
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,000
Cleo's my daughter.

159
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,300
Who is Johnny Marco?

160
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,100
Um...

161
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:08,400
Hey, man, can you take a right on Fountain?
I want to make a quick stop.

162
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,700
Sure.
- Thanks.

163
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,800
Great, man. I'll be back in a minute.

164
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,100
Okay.

165
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,600
I

166
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,600
Thanks, man.
You got it.

167
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,800
All right.

168
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,800
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

169
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,300
What room you in?

170
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,600
59.

171
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:41,000
I met Bono in 59.

172
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,600
oh, yeah?

173
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,000
That's cool.

174
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,000
- See you, man.
- Stay loose.

175
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,700
- Yeah.
Morning, Johnny.

176
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,200
Hey, Marge.

177
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,100
They're waiting for you
at the special effects studio.

178
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,700
They need to do a mould of your head.

179
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,400
The map should be under your door, okay?

180
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,800
Yep, okay.

181
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,400
<GROANS>

182
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:48,100
All right, so, Johnny,
what we're gonna need you to do here...

183
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:51,300
You're slouching a little bit.
We'll need you to sit up a little more.

184
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,300
Oh, yeah. Oh, sure.

185
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:56,000
Now the most important thing to do
is to remain rigidly upright

186
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,800
during this entire process.

187
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,300
- Like this?
- Yeah. Yeah, that's good.

188
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,700
Good in the front for you or...

189
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,500
Uh, I can be.

190
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:15,100
On the left side,
let's pull this back just a little over here.

191
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,000
Close your eyes.

192
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:20,400
Now I'm going to have you
keep your eyes closed

193
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,900
and your mouth closed
for the rest of this process, okay?

194
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,000
Yep.

195
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,600
And this shouldn't take longer
than 40 minutes or so.

196
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,700
Oh!

197
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,100
- Yeah, it's cold, isn't it?
- Hmm.

198
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,500
All right.

199
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:00,600
All right, let's get the, uh...

200
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,400
Let's get the bandages ready.

201
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:04,800
All right.

202
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,000
All right.

203
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,700
Okay, Johnny,
we're just about done.

204
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,500
Let me show you how you look.

205
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,500
Jesus.

206
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,100
Hello?

207
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:15,200
Good evening, Mr. Marco.
Your masseur is here. Shall we send him up?

208
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,600
Him? Okay.

209
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,900
Hey.

210
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,200
- Where's Lori?
Oh, they didn't tell you?

211
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,800
She wasn't available.

212
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,000
No. Come on in.

213
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,600
Whoa!

214
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:02,600
- What the fuck, dude?
- Oh, did they not tell you how I work?

215
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,000
No.

216
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,100
You see, I have a website
that explains my technique.

217
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:08,300
I feel that if my client's naked,

218
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,900
it's just more comfortable
if I meet them at the same level.

219
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:13,200
Yeah, it's not for me.

220
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,000
Thanks, though.
Why don't you just pack it up?

221
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,300
All right.

222
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,400
Sir, I'm sorry about that.

223
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,900
No, it's cool.

224
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:40,400
Gandhi advocated the boycott
of machine made European clothing.

225
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,900
And it caused large scale unemployment
in India.

226
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,400
As always Gandhi wore
only white linen cloth,

227
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:52,100
which had become a symbol
of the entire movement.

228
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:56,300
He took to making a handmade cloth
called khadi.

229
00:39:57,100 --> 00:40:01,300
Most importantly,
it showed India how to be self-reliant.

230
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:26,100
Hi.

231
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,000
You got another cigarette?

232
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,300
Yeah, sure.

233
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:39,700
Hi.

234
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,400
Oh, Shania...

235
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,600
Shannon.
Shannon. Sorry.

236
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,500
- Hey, Cleo.
- Hey.

237
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:03,900
Why are you taking a bath next door?
Is yours broken?

238
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:07,100
Yeah. Yeah, it's been acting weird.

239
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,400
What a nice surprise.

240
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,000
Come on in. You got your stuff?

241
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,800
Shouldn't you be in school today?

242
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,000
it's Sunday.

243
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:26,800
You need to hold down the...
The rhythm.

244
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:28,800
Yeah.
Yeah!

245
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,100
Here we go.

246
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,300
Here we go.

247
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,400
- Are you using your whammy?
- Yup.

248
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,900
Drummers is what you do now.

249
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,200
Why don't you use drummers?

250
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,700
It's not Stewart Copeland?

251
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:24,000
Well, it wasn't that hot pretty girl.

252
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,500
Big lips.

253
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,900
Let's see what the score was.
Let's see the score.

254
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:32,600
Oh, God. Jeez.

255
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:35,400
-97!
-97! Whoa.

256
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,000
-92.
-92.

257
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,500
- I beat you?
- Yeah.

258
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:47,000
Stick to movies!

259
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:48,600
Are you kidding me?

260
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:51,300
Another actor's failed transition into music.

261
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:53,900
Oh, God!

262
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:55,700
Cleo, check this out.

263
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:59,300
You don't do any sports, you just do ballet?

264
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:00,500
Mmm-hmm.

265
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,600
Ice skating.

266
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:04,600
And jazz dance, huh?

267
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:06,200
No.

268
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,500
My sister did jazz dance.

269
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:11,700
It was so stupid. I always had to watch her.

270
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,500
Oh, God, and her stupid leotard.

271
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,700
- Like this? Like...
- Yeah, she looked like...

272
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,700
What else do you do, do you do karate?

273
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:28,200
No.

274
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:33,300
At ballet, are you the best in the class?

275
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,700
I... Well, I try to be, yeah.

276
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:40,600
Ls your ballet teacher an alcoholic?

277
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:42,400
No.

278
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,800
I knew a girl whose ballet teacher
was this alcoholic.

279
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,100
I figured they all were.

280
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,700
It's true, like, you probably don't know
'cause you're a kid.

281
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:52,200
When you get older,
you'll realise she goes off to the back

282
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,100
more often than you guys think, you know.

283
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,900
You can smell wine on her breath.

284
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:59,600
Seriously, it's a big...
it's a big thing for ballet teachers.

285
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:01,100
It is.

286
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:03,900
You don't recognise that stuff.

287
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:06,000
<GROANS>

288
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:08,900
Wait. Do people really...
You can't play on hard.

289
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:10,500
No.
it's so hard.

290
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:13,500
That's insane.

291
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,300
- Hello?
Hi, Johnny.

292
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:18,600
Hey, Marge.

293
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,700
So, the LA Times wants a quote
on your mother's book.

294
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:24,700
I think it's better to give them something.

295
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:26,600
Jesus.

296
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,600
Are you serious?

297
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,400
Yes.

298
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,000
And you need to be in Milan, Wednesday.

299
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,100
We can fly you out tomorrow night
or Tuesday.

300
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:40,000
Are you there?

301
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:42,500
Johnny?

302
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:44,100
Yeah. Yeah, no, I'm here.

303
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:46,400
We'll get you the flight options
later today, okay?

304
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,200
And let us know what you want.

305
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:50,300
All right. Thanks, Marge.

306
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:52,100
I'll talk to you later.

307
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,600
Hi, I need a few things.

308
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:01,200
Could I get three cups of milk,

309
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:03,900
a stick of butter,

310
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,300
some cheddar cheese.

311
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:09,800
And do you have a cheese grater
that you could bring up?

312
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:11,800
Okay. Thank you. Bye.

313
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:19,500
MALE VOICES 15-30.

314
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,000
Oh, that was my point, huh?

315
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:22,700
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

316
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:23,900
Press A.

317
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:26,100
I'm Martina Navratilova.

318
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:28,000
- You like her?
- Well, who?

319
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,900
Martina Navratilova.

320
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:31,700
She'd like you.

321
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,200
MALE VOICES 30 all.

322
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,100
Oh, look at Martina's power!

323
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:39,500
Yeah! Oh!

324
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:41,900
Oh. Oh!

325
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,200
Ah!
40-30.

326
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:46,600
Martina against who are you?

327
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:48,400
- Sharapova?
- You're Martina?

328
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,200
- You're some communist bitch.
- What?

329
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,600
- Maria Sharapova?
- Yeah. Yeah.

330
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:56,200
Even Martina wouldn't like you now.

331
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:57,600
Game point.

332
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:00,100
Wow. Your turn.

333
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:02,100
Red team wins!

334
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:36,200
Hey, Layla. Hold on a sec.

335
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:38,400
Yeah?

336
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:41,400
I'm going away for a little while.

337
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,900
I need you to take Cleo to camp,
she's going there for e few weeks.

338
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,900
It's close to your parents.

339
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:53,200
- When are you coming back?
- I don't know.

340
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:56,300
I need a little time.

341
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:00,000
How long? I'm going to Italy.

342
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,300
I've got my movie opening there.

343
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:05,500
Just make sure
she gets to Belmont by the 10th.

344
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:08,500
Bye, Johnny.

345
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:10,600
Yeah.

346
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:20,400
Welcome to LAX, Mr. Marco.
- Thanks.

347
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,600
Right through those doors
and to the left, please.

348
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:23,800
Great.

349
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,100
- Got everything?
- Got the passports.

350
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:27,100
Okay.

351
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:30,300
Hello.
- Hi.

352
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:38,900
Right this way.

353
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,500
I

354
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:34,100
Mr. Marco, I hope you enjoy your suite.

355
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:35,200
Thank you.

356
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:37,800
Bedrooms are on the left.

357
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,200
Please, this way.

358
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:50,500
And here's your swimming pool.

359
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:54,200
Oh, my God!
Wow!

360
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:56,000
And this is your way
to the salon.

361
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,600
Thank you.

362
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:04,500
Hey, Pupi

363
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:07,800
This is my daughter, Cleo.

364
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:09,800
- Hi, Cleo! How are you?
- Hi, I'm good.

365
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:11,200
Ciao, Cleo.

366
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:14,800
Listen, you take your time in your suite.

367
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:17,700
And we'll see you downstairs
when you're ready, okay? In the lobby.

368
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:19,100
- Great, thank you.
- Okay.

369
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:21,800
- Thank you, bye. Enjoy, yeah?
Bye.

370
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,100
Ciao.

371
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:25,800
See you.

372
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:37,600
- That's fine, Pupi.
Mr. Marco.

373
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,300
- Ah!
- I hope you had a nice rest.

374
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:41,300
So Pupi's waiting for us in the next room.

375
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:42,800
Hello, Johnny.

376
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,600
- Hi.
- Can I talk to you?

377
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:48,400
Yeah. Be right back.

378
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:53,500
What the fuck, Johnny?

379
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:56,000
Did you think you'd never
fucking see me again?

380
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:57,700
Take it easy, okay?

381
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:06,000
Good news, Johnny!

382
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,100
I spoke with the mayor.
He's giving you the key to the city.

383
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,100
Okay, give me the hand, please.

384
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,400
Hi, Johnny! How you doing?

385
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:21,600
- Hi.
- Hey!

386
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:24,800
Welcome to Italy.

387
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:25,900
Thank you.

388
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:27,700
So can I ask you some questions?

389
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,500
- Sure.
- Okay.

390
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:32,100
What's the first...
Um, what's the most beautiful thing

391
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:33,600
you have done in Italy so far?

392
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:35,900
Well, we just arrived in the hotel, so...

393
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:37,100
Okay.

394
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:46,200
Do you speak some Italian words?
Some few words.

395
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:21,600
- Can you hold your breath?
Huh?

396
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:24,900
- Can you hold your breath? There and back.
- Okay. I'll try.

397
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,500
- One more.
- It took too long.

398
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,700
How about the handstand?

399
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:49,100
- That was good before.
- Okay.

400
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:58,000
7.2.

401
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,700
Are you sleeping?

402
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:15,400
No.

403
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
You want to get a snack?

404
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:22,500
Yeah.

405
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:34,400
How can we be of service to you?

406
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:38,900
Um... What kind of gelato do you have?

407
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:42,900
Cioccolata, strawberry, pistachio e vaniglia.

408
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,900
Hmm. Well, we'd like to try them all.

409
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Uh, could you send up two of each, please?

410
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,900
Certamente, Mr. Marco.

411
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:51,600
Thank you.

412
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:32,600
How about vanilla? Did you try it?

413
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:34,500
- Mmm. Good.
- Mmm-mmm.

414
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:42,500
Mmm.

415
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:46,900
- I like strawberry the best.
- I like chocolate.

416
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:49,900
I know you do.

417
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:23,200
- Hi.
Were you sleeping?

418
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:24,500
No.

419
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:27,100
Come in.

420
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:13,100
How old are you, Cleo?

421
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:14,300
Eleven.

422
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:18,700
Do you have a boyfriend?

423
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:26,100
When I was eleven
I was so in love with this boy. Nino Viti.

424
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:28,200
He was so handsome.

425
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:30,100
And he had a scooter.

426
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,300
Do you like to ride a scooter?

427
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:35,600
sure.

428
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:37,900
Morning.
- Good morning.

429
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:39,300
Hi.

430
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:59,300
Mmm.

431
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
The coffee's good.

432
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:05,300
Do you like coffee?

433
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,100
it's good.

434
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:18,500
So, Johnny. We stop by the awards show.

435
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:19,500
Mmm-hmm.

436
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:24,200
You tell something about
your history with Al Pacino, everything.

437
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:27,800
And after, you remember,
we have the dinner with the mayor.

438
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:29,600
- it's very important. Okay?
- Okay.

439
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:34,400
Wow.

440
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:37,400
- She's beautiful.
- You look beautiful, Cleo.

441
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:39,100
Thanks.

442
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:43,000
- Shall we?
- Mmm-hmm.

443
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:22,300
Congratulations!

444
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:25,400
Congratulations, Johnny.

445
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:36,200
The stage is yours.

446
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,700
No, no, no! No, no!

447
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:48,600
This is Miss Lane's car.

448
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:50,400
Can you please take us to the airport?

449
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:54,400
I'm supposed to be waiting here but...
For you, Mr. Marco, we'll go.

450
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:56,500
- I'll get you there.
- Thank you.

451
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:26,000
- Hey.
- Hey.

452
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:28,500
- Welcome back. Nice to see you.
- Thanks.

453
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:38,000
You take that spot.

454
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:48,400
How you doing?

455
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,200
- Tired.
- Yeah, me too.

456
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,900
Hi, Johnny, welcome back.

457
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:57,200
Hey, Romulo, how are things, man?

458
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:59,800
Good. Would you like a song?

459
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:02,000
Good.

460
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:06,000
Have you ever heard him sing before?

461
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,100
Just wait. He's great.

462
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:30,700
Baby, let me be your loving teddy bear

463
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:35,600
Put a chain around my neck
And lead me anywhere

464
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:40,500
Oh, let me be your teddy bear

465
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:46,200
Baby, let me be around you every night

466
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:50,400
Run your fingers through my hair
and cuddle me real tight

467
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:54,500
Oh, let me be your teddy bear

468
01:01:55,500 --> 01:02:00,800
I don't wanna be a tiger
'Cause tigers play too rough

469
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:03,000
I don't wanna be a lion

470
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:06,700
'Cause lions ain't the kind you love enough

471
01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:11,700
Just wanna be your teddy bear

472
01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:16,500
Put a chain around my neck
And lead me anywhere

473
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:20,400
Oh, let me be your teddy bear

474
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:27,000
I just wanna be your teddy bear

475
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:33,700
Thank you very much.
- Thanks, Romulo.

476
01:03:58,700 --> 01:04:00,500
- Morning, beautiful.
- Good morning, Victor.

477
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:01,700
I have your orange juice.

478
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:03,300
Thank you.
Oh, can you bring it in the kitchen?

479
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:04,500
Yeah.

480
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:10,900
Mmm. This is so good.

481
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:12,800
Yeah, it's really good, Cleo.

482
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:14,800
- Mmm, you got the sauce perfect.
- Thanks.

483
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:16,500
It's, like, not too heavy.

484
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:18,300
Mmm.

485
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:21,700
I'm making a list
for the things I need for camp.

486
01:04:21,700 --> 01:04:23,400
I have tennis racquet, tennis balls,

487
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:26,300
bathing suit, shampoo and conditioner.
What else?

488
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:27,600
- Sunglasses.
- Okay.

489
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:29,800
Bring your own soap.

490
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:33,900
So you don't get warts from the other kids.
That always happens at camp.

491
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,100
Ask your dad.

492
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,300
Maybe some snacks. You might get hungry.

493
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:41,700
You're not allowed.

494
01:04:42,100 --> 01:04:44,500
Well, you can sneak a little in your backpack.

495
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,300
Get hungry at night or something.

496
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:52,700
Wow.

497
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,200
Oh, I like that spin move. What is that?

498
01:04:57,500 --> 01:04:58,600
Chaîné turn.

499
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,400
Cool. Chainay-nay turn.

500
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:07,000
That's one of the fundamentals
of Afro-Cuban dancing, huh?

501
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:09,500
Is that what you're doing?

502
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:11,300
- Ballet.
Oh, ballet.

503
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:13,600
We're almost there.

504
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:19,200
Have you read all these, Dad?

505
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:20,800
None of them.

506
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:24,200
I've got an idea. Why don't you be my reader?

507
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:27,600
You read them and tell me
if the character is any good.

508
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:28,700
I'll check it out.

509
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,600
Why don't we read Cleo's diary?

510
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:31,700
No.

511
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:35,000
When me and your dad
were a little bit older than you,

512
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,700
we got your Aunt Tiffany's diary,

513
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:39,000
and she was going through, like,
a rebellious stage.

514
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,900
And we read it all dramatically
to a tape recorder

515
01:05:41,900 --> 01:05:43,900
and we waited until she got home.

516
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:46,900
And, it was like... It was really bad.

517
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:49,400
We put it on the stereo
and turned it on really loud.

518
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,300
And then we just went running.

519
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:53,600
- Oh! I got it.
- What'd she do?

520
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:54,900
She raised hell.

521
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:57,900
I just heard her screaming and crying.

522
01:05:57,900 --> 01:06:00,500
I wasn't allowed over for like a month.

523
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:04,200
- They should have kicked your dad out, too.
- I got it.

524
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:07,500
We were looking for adventure, though.

525
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:08,900
Oh, crap.

526
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:10,700
Oh!

527
01:06:11,900 --> 01:06:13,400
Damn.

528
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:15,600
Souvenir?

529
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:18,500
- That smells.
- No, no, no.

530
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:20,100
Smell it, smell it.

531
01:07:02,100 --> 01:07:03,900
All right. Anybody following us?

532
01:07:05,700 --> 01:07:07,500
No. The coast is clear.

533
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:13,300
Have you talked to your mom?

534
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:17,200
No, I left her a message.

535
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:19,100
How has she been doing?

536
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:21,900
She's good, I guess.

537
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:31,200
Whoa!

538
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:33,400
What the... Hold on.

539
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:37,500
Damn it.

540
01:07:43,900 --> 01:07:45,300
Hey. I was driving...

541
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:48,600
I need a tow.

542
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:51,800
Sunset and Sierra.

543
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:55,600
No.

544
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,200
Thanks.

545
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:09,500
Now what?

546
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:23,500
There you go.

547
01:08:33,100 --> 01:08:34,600
This is not a good time.

548
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:36,700
Are you sure?

549
01:08:37,100 --> 01:08:38,300
Yeah.

550
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:41,500
- Hey, Cleo, you hungry?
- Mmm-hmm.

551
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:44,200
- You want to go downstairs, get a burger?
- Oh, yeah.

552
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:53,300
- All right. So what do you got?
- A triple.

553
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:54,600
Get out of there.

554
01:08:57,700 --> 01:08:59,700
- Two tens.
- Shuffle 'em.

555
01:09:02,100 --> 01:09:04,800
Am I ever going to win a game today or...

556
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:07,100
Think I'll win? Can I win a game?

557
01:09:07,900 --> 01:09:09,300
Oh, there's your outfit.

558
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:16,000
- I think that hat would look good on you.
- it's a turban.

559
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,300
Well, maybe we should get you
one of those for camp?

560
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:20,500
That's embarrassing.

561
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:24,300
Look at their outfits.

562
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:26,400
Val Kilmer calls himself Val-ibu.

563
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:31,700
Check this out. Cleo.

564
01:09:32,900 --> 01:09:34,100
Hi, Johnny.

565
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:37,300
Hey, how you doing?

566
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:38,400
Good.

567
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:44,500
What? I don't know her that well.

568
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:49,400
The airplane!

569
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:52,000
I used to do this. It was a lot easier.

570
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:04,100
You're getting big.

571
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:08,800
Hey, you want to stay one more day
before we go?

572
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:09,900
Yeah.

573
01:10:15,900 --> 01:10:17,400
It's that sound it makes
when we're doing good.

574
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:18,900
I like that sound.

575
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:22,300
- Okay, here we go.
- I'll let that one go.

576
01:10:25,700 --> 01:10:26,900
- I got it.
- Okay.

577
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:28,700
Okay.

578
01:11:02,700 --> 01:11:05,000
- How are you doing?
- I'm good.

579
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:51,300
- Can we pet him?
- Yes.

580
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:52,900
Oh, hey!

581
01:12:52,900 --> 01:12:55,300
Hey, sweetie! Hi!

582
01:12:57,100 --> 01:12:59,000
What's that book about again?

583
01:12:59,100 --> 01:13:01,900
it's about this girl
that's in love with this guy.

584
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:05,700
But he's a vampire
and his whole family is vampires,

585
01:13:05,700 --> 01:13:07,500
so she can't really be with him.

586
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:09,300
Why doesn't she become one, too?

587
01:13:09,300 --> 01:13:12,600
Because she can't.
He doesn't want to turn her into a vampire.

588
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:15,700
And if she gets too close to him,
he won't be able to help himself.

589
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,100
Oh!

590
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:03,000
Okay.

591
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:06,300
- You need that? No?
- No.

592
01:14:12,500 --> 01:14:13,800
Allow me.

593
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:19,400
- See you, Ray.
Take care, Johnny.

594
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,600
Cleo, what's wrong?

595
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:33,700
Why are you crying?

596
01:15:36,700 --> 01:15:39,300
I don't know when Mom's coming back.

597
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:47,700
She said she had to go away for a while.

598
01:15:47,700 --> 01:15:50,700
But she didn't say
when she was coming back.

599
01:15:52,100 --> 01:15:53,800
And you're always gone.

600
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:03,600
Come here.

601
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:06,000
Don't cry, honey.

602
01:16:42,700 --> 01:16:44,900
Another two...

603
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:46,100
- That's a bet, sir.
- Come on.

604
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:48,000
Come on, 11.

605
01:16:48,900 --> 01:16:50,500
- Seven.
- Seven.

606
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:56,100
Excuse me, sir. She can't be at the table.
She has to take a step back.

607
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,100
Okay. Stand over there.

608
01:17:01,100 --> 01:17:04,000
- Okay, folks.
- All right, here we go. Here we go.

609
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,200
Come on!

610
01:17:06,900 --> 01:17:08,900
All righty. Watch this.

611
01:17:08,900 --> 01:17:11,200
You always want to take the full odds.

612
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:13,200
Always. it's the best bet.

613
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:15,800
It's the only bet where the house
and the player have the same advantage.

614
01:17:15,700 --> 01:17:16,900
You got it?

615
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:18,900
- Okay. Got it.
- Okay, sir, your dice.

616
01:17:20,700 --> 01:17:23,700
- Go hard 10. Hard 10.
- That's a bet, sir.

617
01:17:23,700 --> 01:17:26,000
- I want a hard 10. Say, "Hard 10."
- Hard 10.

618
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,800
Hard 10. Come on!

619
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:30,200
- it's okay. it's all right.
- Four, four...

620
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:32,000
- Easy four.
- I'm still in there.

621
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:33,900
Still alive.

622
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:36,700
Sorry there.

623
01:17:36,700 --> 01:17:38,700
- Hard 10. Come on!
- Your dice.

624
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:40,700
Hard 10!

625
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,900
Hard 10!

626
01:17:44,300 --> 01:17:46,500
We got it, we got both wins.

627
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:44,600
All right.

628
01:18:44,900 --> 01:18:46,200
Have fun at camp.

629
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:50,000
- I'll see you in a few weeks.
- Okay.

630
01:18:55,700 --> 01:18:56,800
Okay.

631
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:00,400
- Bye.
- Bye.

632
01:19:11,100 --> 01:19:12,300
Cleo!

633
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:21,200
I'm sorry I haven't been around.

634
01:22:34,300 --> 01:22:36,500
Hello.
- Layla?

635
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:38,700
Johnny.

636
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:40,900
Hey.

637
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:45,000
What's wrong?

638
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:53,000
I'm fucking nothing.

639
01:23:02,500 --> 01:23:04,100
I'm not even a person.

640
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:10,600
Why don't you try volunteering
or something?

641
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:11,800
No.

642
01:23:19,900 --> 01:23:21,300
I don't know what to do.

643
01:23:31,100 --> 01:23:33,400
I'm just... I want...

644
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:38,200
Can you... Can you come over? Just...

645
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,700
Can you come over?

646
01:23:41,700 --> 01:23:43,400
No, I can't.

647
01:23:47,100 --> 01:23:49,300
All right. Thanks.

648
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:51,400
Johnny, you're gonna be okay.

649
01:26:37,300 --> 01:26:39,800
Hello, Mr. Marco.
How can I help you today?

650
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:41,500
Hey, is Serena around?

651
01:26:41,500 --> 01:26:44,400
You know, she's not in.
Can I help you with something?

652
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:46,800
I'm gonna be checking out.

653
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:50,700
Oh, all right. Well, should we put your things
in storage until you return?

654
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:54,000
No. Just box it up
and I'll get an address to you.

655
01:26:53,900 --> 01:26:55,700
Yes, Mr. Marco. Have a great day.

656
01:26:55,700 --> 01:26:57,000
