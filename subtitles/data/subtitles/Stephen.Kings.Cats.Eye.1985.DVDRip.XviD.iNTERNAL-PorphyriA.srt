<i>Help me. Help me.</i>

2
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:28,265
<i>Up here. Look up here.</i>

3
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:33,105
<i>Help me.</i>

4
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:37,440
<i>You've got to find it.</i>

5
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:39,309
<i>It's after me.</i>

6
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:47,253
<i>You've got to get back and find it.</i>

7
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:49,585
<i>You've got to stop it.</i>

8
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:53,031
<i>Please help me. You've got to help me.</i>

00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:58,432
Nice little pussycat.

10
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:01,103
You just saved me a trip to the pound.

11
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:04,109
What are you so excited about?

12
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:07,176
What am I, a cat psychologist?

13
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:10,279
Get in there.

14
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:34,167
Well, this is the place.

15
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:37,639
- I don't know about this, Jim.
- You said you wanted to quit these.

16
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,300
But I'd like to know...

17
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:42,312
Go on, Dickie, before you lose your guts.

18
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:46,049
- Why don't you come up with me?
- It doesn't work that way.

19
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,677
It's against the rules.

20
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:51,121
What is this, a "quit smoking" clinic
or the CIA?

21
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:56,424
It'll turn your life around, Dick.
I guarantee it.

22
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:59,257
That's what Jim Jones said
when he spiked the punch.

23
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:29,055
I guess this is where you come
to quit smoking, right?

24
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:31,961
- Fill one of these out, please.
- No, I have a pen.

25
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:45,426
Honey!

26
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:51,774
Are you all right?

27
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:54,239
Sweetheart...

28
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:00,178
No, no...

29
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:04,779
Oh, my precious. It's all right.
You'll be fine.

30
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:08,017
- Take me home, please.
- I will. Come on.

31
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:09,185
Hang on to me.

32
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:14,697
I've been a smoker for a long time.
Since I was 16.

33
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:17,626
It is very hard.

34
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,168
Come on, now, sweetheart.

35
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:25,372
The elevator is down here. One step...

36
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:31,878
- Excuse me...
- I'll take that.

37
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:34,646
Actually, I think I've changed my mind.

38
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:36,482
- Mr. Morrison?
- Yes?

39
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:39,819
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
- It's all right. I was just...

40
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:41,052
Come with me.

41
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,091
We're about to change your life.

42
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:45,130
For the better, I hope.

43
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:52,461
The founding father?

44
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:54,038
Please, Mr. Morrison.

45
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:11,550
I see you have a daughter who's 10.

46
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:13,958
Alicia.

47
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:17,692
You left the space for her school blank.

48
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:21,462
Where my daughter goes to school
has no connection with...

49
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:24,697
...whether or not you can help me
to quit smoking, Mr. Donatti.

50
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:34,176
- Are we going to get down to it, or not?
- Yes, of course.

51
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:38,242
In fact, we've already started
getting down to it.

52
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:46,418
Do you have cigarettes with you?

53
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:50,688
Does a bear shit in the woods?

54
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:53,292
May I have them, please?

55
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:37,637
Our methods here at Quitters Incorporated
are rather radical.

56
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:41,646
As a treatment, Mr. Donatti, they suck.

57
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:45,115
There's a newsstand down in the lobby,
they sell all brands.

58
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:47,583
Availability is only part of the problem.

59
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,448
The fallback rate for reformed smokers...

60
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:53,219
...is higher than the fallback rate
for heroin addicts.

61
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:56,523
<i>You can spare me the Reader's Digest
lecture, my friend, because...</i>

62
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,257
...I've changed my mind.

63
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:02,759
Will you open this door?

64
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:05,030
You've got a hell of a problem,
Mr. Morrison.

65
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:08,197
But we here at Quitters have developed
a hell of a solution.

66
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:11,038
You'll have a hell of a problem
if you don't open this door!

67
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:16,974
Relax, Mr. Morrison.

68
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:20,411
Here's something that might interest you.

69
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:28,387
Watch closely, Mr. Morrison.
Nothing up either sleeve...

70
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:32,223
...and you will notice at no time
does my hand leave my wrist.

71
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:40,763
The music is part of his conditioning.

72
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:46,439
Boogie down, baby.

73
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:03,256
What are you doing? Stop it!

74
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,956
You're killing him!

75
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:09,697
Kill the nice kitty? Oh, no, he's fine.

76
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:14,303
Maybe a little crispy around the paws,
but otherwise he's fine.

77
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:20,075
Damn it!
You barbecue all the cats you want.

78
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:22,478
If you don't let me out
inside of 15 seconds...

79
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:25,779
...I'll call the cops on you
faster than you can say "Marlboro Man."

80
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:30,288
You better listen to the big picture,
Mr. Morrison.

81
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:33,822
Quitters Incorporated was endowed
by a very important person.

82
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:37,888
After he died of lung cancer,
we realized there were techniques...

83
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:39,965
...he had developed
in the family business...

84
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:42,660
...that we can now use
to stop people from smoking.

85
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:45,731
Actually, this is a very nice tax gimmick...

86
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:49,505
...but mainly we're interested
in helping our fellow man.

87
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:54,309
For the first month our operatives
will have you under constant supervision.

88
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,575
You may see some of them all of the time.

89
00:11:56,649 --> 00:12:00,881
You may see all of them some of the time,
but believe me, Mr. Morrison...

90
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:04,452
...you'll never see all of them
all of the time.

91
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:07,582
You smoke, they'll see you.

92
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:12,363
You'll bring me down here
and stick me in the old cat room?

93
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:13,157
No.

94
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:17,998
We'll bring your wife down here
and stick her in the cat room.

95
00:12:18,704 --> 00:12:20,035
You get to watch.

96
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:26,075
<i>I'm a man of medicine.
I'm expected to save lives...</i>

97
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:29,378
<i>... and ease suffering, and I love people.</i>

98
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,082
<i>Therefore, I would have no choice...</i>

99
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:35,914
<i>... but to kill the son of a bitch!</i>

100
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:38,522
"Kill the son of a bitch." Good idea.

101
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,419
- What did you say?
- What?

102
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:44,321
Nothing. I was...

103
00:12:46,298 --> 00:12:47,993
<i>I can't believe this is happening.</i>

104
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:51,867
<i>It's happening, Mr. Morrison.
First offense, your wife gets the juice.</i>

105
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:54,572
Not too much, just enough to hurt.

106
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:58,104
Second time,
we bring your daughter Alicia here.

107
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:01,837
Imagine, Mr. Morrison, your daughter
in there instead of the cat.

108
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:06,178
The third offense, I'm afraid I'll have
to send someone out to rape your wife.

109
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:08,880
There's a rather disturbed individual
we keep around...

110
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:11,354
...just for such distasteful jobs.

111
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:13,685
<i>In the meantime...</i>

112
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:17,195
<i>... content yourself knowing
that only 2 percent of our clients...</i>

113
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:20,164
...ever fall from grace a fourth time.

114
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,494
And if they do?

115
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:26,132
Then we give up, Mr. Morrison.

116
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,300
Oh, my God!

117
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:34,503
- What's wrong?
- I spilled my drink.

118
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:39,513
Dick, as long as you keep using
your left tit for a coaster, that will happen.

119
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:43,678
I have no idea what's going on
in this damn movie. Who writes this crap?

120
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:56,265
- Dick?
- What?

121
00:13:57,469 --> 00:13:59,801
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

122
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:02,536
You're like a bear tonight, what is it?

123
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:05,973
Nothing! Well, it's everything.
I mean, I quit smoking today.

124
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:09,809
Since when? Five minutes ago?

125
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:12,175
Since 2:45 this afternoon.

126
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:15,151
You haven't had a cigarette in six hours?

127
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:18,313
Six hours and 23 minutes.

128
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,951
Cindy, I'm trying to get
some ice cream here. Okay?

129
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:26,393
What in the world
made you decide to quit?

130
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:28,624
I'm doing it for you...

131
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:30,630
...and for Alicia.

132
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:36,106
That's the sweetest thing I ever heard.

133
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:38,740
Even if you don't make it,
we both thank you.

134
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:44,143
I think I'll make it.

135
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:49,366
Hello?

136
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:55,933
Is somebody in there?

137
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:00,638
I didn't smoke it, see?

138
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:06,240
If you're in there, would you tell Donatti
that I didn't smoke it?

139
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:12,180
I actually was just coming to get...

140
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:13,989
...my golf clubs.

141
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:39,742
Want some coffee?

142
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,107
Jesus!

143
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:43,214
I assume that's a "yes."

144
00:19:46,084 --> 00:19:47,984
Talk about aversion therapy.

145
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:56,427
That's it. That's it.

146
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:30,924
Daddy!

147
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,326
Hi, baby.

148
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:40,336
Okay, eyes closed? There we go.

149
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:42,565
Now we're skipping with eyes closed.

150
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:48,338
We're going to skip over to here.

151
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:50,242
Are those eyes closed?

152
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:53,250
I think they're open. Are they closed?
Are they real tight?

153
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:56,684
We don't want to spoil any surprises.

154
00:20:56,855 --> 00:20:59,119
I think now it's time to open them.

155
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:08,231
Thank you, Daddy.

156
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:11,801
I'm glad you like it. You know what?

157
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:14,394
I love you, Alicia.

158
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:18,400
What's its name?

159
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:21,773
I think it's right here on the tag.
Hold on here. Its name is...

160
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:23,908
..."Norma Jean."

161
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:26,541
Norma...

162
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:28,512
...Jean.

163
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:32,623
I love Norma Jean.

164
00:21:33,892 --> 00:21:35,223
I'm glad, baby.

165
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:45,801
You got Norma Jean, you got her shoe,
and you got her adoption papers.

166
00:21:45,904 --> 00:21:48,134
Now go back with the kids
and be a good girl.

167
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:56,708
You love her a lot, don't you?

168
00:21:56,782 --> 00:21:59,546
One of your men was in my closet
last night. In my home!

169
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:00,949
- Really?
- Yes, really.

170
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:02,984
It's possible, I suppose.

171
00:22:03,288 --> 00:22:05,654
Constant supervision for the first month...

172
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:09,783
...is what we promise,
and that's what the client gets.

173
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:12,694
- You're a son of a bitch.
- Yes, I'm a son of a bitch.

174
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,463
It takes a son of a bitch to beat the habit.

175
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:19,026
People who are unable to turn into
sons of bitches on their own behalf...

176
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:20,161
...come to us.

177
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:23,001
We give them what they need.
Believe me, we do.

178
00:22:23,642 --> 00:22:27,305
I don't know what your hoods told you,
but I didn't smoke!

179
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:31,109
If you had lit that cigarette in your mouth,
you wouldn't be here now.

180
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:35,443
You'd be down at my office watching
your wife hop around in the little room.

181
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:38,286
You love your wife, you love your kid.

182
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:41,387
Unfashionable these days, but useful.

183
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:44,452
I think you'll make it, Mr. Morrison.

184
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:46,761
We'll be watching you.

185
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:27,294
If an asshole like me
could stay in business...

186
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:30,771
I said it wasn't easy,
but with assholes like him around...

187
00:23:30,842 --> 00:23:32,173
...I got by.

188
00:23:34,045 --> 00:23:36,138
- Not bad?
- No, not bad at all.

189
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:39,274
So he says, "What do you think
the SEC's going to say...

190
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:41,182
<i>''...when they hear about this? "</i>

191
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:53,055
Two things: First,
they'll say they heard it all before.

192
00:23:53,131 --> 00:23:56,362
Second, they'll say P.T. Barnum was right.

193
00:23:56,668 --> 00:23:59,228
There's a sucker born every minute.

194
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:08,406
Earth to Dick.

195
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,344
Earth to Dick Morrison. Come in, Dick!

196
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:14,078
I'm a little tired, kind of under the weather.

197
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:15,778
Have a cigarette.

198
00:24:15,854 --> 00:24:17,788
No! Thanks, no. I'm sorry, I quit.

199
00:24:18,356 --> 00:24:20,051
I did, really.

200
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,620
Sure.

201
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:25,257
No, two weeks ago, done.

202
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:29,227
Two weeks, two months, two years.
It doesn't matter!

203
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:33,064
A big presentation comes along,
a make-or-break meeting...

204
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,205
...a marathon sales conference.

205
00:24:35,273 --> 00:24:36,262
Boom!

206
00:24:36,341 --> 00:24:38,832
You'll be right back on them.

207
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,113
Come on, have a cigarette.

208
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:51,856
Come on, have a cigarette.

209
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:53,781
No, I gave those babies up.

210
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:03,063
Ding-ding, the smoking lamp is lit.

211
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:27,355
Dickie.

212
00:25:28,426 --> 00:25:30,087
Shove it up your ass, Hal.

213
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:36,924
What? Lit?

214
00:28:04,716 --> 00:28:05,740
Shit!

215
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:42,383
Cindy!

216
00:28:49,427 --> 00:28:50,587
Cindy!

217
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,710
Cindy?

218
00:29:09,781 --> 00:29:11,305
<i>Hello, Mr. Morrison.</i>

219
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:15,075
It seems we have
some business to attend to.

220
00:29:15,186 --> 00:29:16,653
<i>Will 5:00 be all right?</i>

221
00:29:16,721 --> 00:29:19,918
It was just a slip, Mr. Donatti.

222
00:29:19,991 --> 00:29:22,926
It was just a little slip. I mean, really.

223
00:29:22,994 --> 00:29:26,521
I swear it won't happen again.
It's funny, it didn't even taste good.

224
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:29,962
<i>- I'll count on you for 5:00, shall I?
- Look, Mr. Donatti...</i>

225
00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:31,524
Donatti!

226
00:29:35,707 --> 00:29:38,403
Son of a bitch! Where's my wife, you turd?

227
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:39,907
Hello, Mr. Morrison.

228
00:29:39,978 --> 00:29:43,038
He got smart with his fists.
Unfortunately he's got dumb fists.

229
00:29:43,214 --> 00:29:44,442
Where's Cindy?

230
00:30:00,598 --> 00:30:02,031
Junk, you idiot!

231
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:14,305
Oh, fiddly sticks!

232
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:17,881
Here, kitty, kitty.

233
00:30:18,783 --> 00:30:20,011
Here, kitty, kitty.

234
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:23,310
Forget the cat, you hemorrhoid!
Get the gun!

235
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:28,785
Get up, Mr. Morrison.
Let's not have any more of this foolishness.

236
00:30:38,102 --> 00:30:41,697
I understand your agitation.
It will not be held against you.

237
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:44,607
- At least not by me.
- Please, Mr. Donatti.

238
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:48,371
You be a good boy, Mr. Morrison,
and don't provoke Junk again.

239
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:51,115
I will make this as brief as possible.

240
00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:54,082
Your wife will not be hurt, this time.

241
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:55,944
Watch him, Junk.

242
00:31:21,613 --> 00:31:24,946
Remember, it's just like
getting a shot at the doctor's office.

243
00:31:51,142 --> 00:31:53,167
Would you stop it? You're killing her!

244
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:56,270
Take it easy, Mr. Morrison. She'll be fine.

245
00:32:16,901 --> 00:32:19,301
I think you got some explaining to do.

246
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:20,662
Don't you?

247
00:32:33,518 --> 00:32:35,918
Ain't you going to turn the sound up?

248
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,681
There's no reason to.

249
00:32:37,822 --> 00:32:41,690
When you've been in the business as
long as I have, you get to know every line.

250
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:45,456
In 30 seconds she'll either squeeze him
hard enough to give him a hernia...

251
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:47,930
...or she'll slap him in the face
and walk out.

252
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:53,763
- $10 says that she slaps him.
- You're on.

253
00:32:56,941 --> 00:32:58,101
Oh, darn.

254
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:34,074
No, no.

255
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:39,382
That's eight pounds in six months.
I don't think that's so bad.

256
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:42,246
An ounce of prevention
is worth a pound of cure.

257
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,915
73 percent of our clients get a weight
problem when they quit smoking.

258
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:49,589
I want you to get dressed,
and you and I will have a talk.

259
00:33:50,161 --> 00:33:52,629
Junk, you think eight pounds
is bad in six months?

260
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:54,130
I think it's great.

261
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,594
So remember...

262
00:33:56,667 --> 00:34:00,000
...some of these diet pills are illegal,
so use them sparingly.

263
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:03,363
I'm setting your maximum weight
at 165 pounds.

264
00:34:03,574 --> 00:34:07,476
If I go over, you'll send a guy
to my house with a flamethrower?

265
00:34:07,645 --> 00:34:11,741
I'll send a guy to your house
and cut off your wife's little finger.

266
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:14,316
- You kill me.
- Have a good day, Dick.

267
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:17,046
Cut off my wife's little finger.

268
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:19,122
Sorry to keep you waiting.

269
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:27,364
I think a toast is in order,
a toast is in order.

270
00:34:28,132 --> 00:34:32,034
No throwing the glasses in the fireplace,
we don't want to wake the kids.

271
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:34,365
The ladies are entitled
to break their glasses.

272
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:36,896
To Quitters Incorporated.

273
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:38,731
To Quitters Incorporated.

274
00:34:39,877 --> 00:34:41,367
To Quitters Incorporated.

275
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,217
To Quitters Incorporated.

276
00:35:14,011 --> 00:35:16,002
Go on, scat! Go on.

277
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:53,648
<i>Come on, Darcy, it's Gobbler time.</i>

278
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:59,786
<i>You just sit right there.</i>

279
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:04,951
<i>Gobblers is all that Darcy eats
because it's her most favorite.</i>

280
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:11,892
<i>Listen to me carefully:
It's still looking for me.</i>

281
00:36:12,236 --> 00:36:14,397
<i>You've got to get back and find it.</i>

282
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:19,942
<i>You're my only chance.</i>

283
00:36:24,081 --> 00:36:25,673
Lucky night, Mr. Cressner.

284
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:28,909
Don't jump to any conclusions.
The night ain't over.

285
00:36:30,254 --> 00:36:32,722
- Good night, Mr. Cressner.
- Good night, sweetheart.

286
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:35,759
- Richard, cash these.
- You got it.

287
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:42,833
<i>Buona notte, Mr. Cressner.</i>

288
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:48,065
- Good night, Mr. C.
- Good night, Harry.

289
00:36:51,075 --> 00:36:53,839
- Have you spoken to Ducky?
- Yes, Mr. Cressner.

290
00:36:54,111 --> 00:36:56,011
He's got my wife and her friend in view?

291
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:59,106
She and the tennis guy
are in a white Mustang convertible.

292
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,343
Ducky's right on it. Right behind her.

293
00:37:01,485 --> 00:37:03,953
Good. You're a good man.

294
00:37:04,922 --> 00:37:07,356
So, folks, what's it going to be?

295
00:37:07,658 --> 00:37:12,425
Dean Martin is at the Golden Nugget and
haven't seen him since I was a little girl.

296
00:37:12,597 --> 00:37:14,565
Have you taken care
of your domestic problem?

297
00:37:14,632 --> 00:37:17,396
- I got everything well in hand.
- Good.

298
00:37:17,535 --> 00:37:20,470
- The Golden Nugget will be fine.
- Thank you so much.

299
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:25,403
Oh, look at that. A cat.

300
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:40,785
My daddy used to say
that all cats should be drowned...

301
00:37:40,858 --> 00:37:42,792
...after they stop playing with spools.

302
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:45,693
- He said that?
- He must have been a great humanitarian.

303
00:37:51,302 --> 00:37:54,135
I bet that cat is going to get run over.

304
00:37:54,305 --> 00:37:56,637
I got $2,000 says he can make it.

305
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:58,071
- You're kidding?
- No.

306
00:37:58,142 --> 00:38:00,042
- You're on.
- $2,000 that he can make it.

307
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:02,773
- Cat's dead. You're on.
- Here you go. Okay?

308
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,508
- You say he makes it, I say he's dead.
- All right.

309
00:38:05,683 --> 00:38:08,151
- I can do anything I want?
- So can I. Anybody can.

310
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:10,847
No. I can do anything I want,
you don't say a word.

311
00:38:11,689 --> 00:38:13,714
Anybody can do anything they want.

312
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,918
- Watch me.
- I'm watching.

313
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,049
Come on, cat.

314
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:19,986
Come here, kitty. Come on, kitty.

315
00:38:22,433 --> 00:38:25,766
- You guys would bet on anything.
- Yeah. That's what it's all about.

316
00:38:27,905 --> 00:38:29,634
Come here, little kitty.

317
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:31,798
Come on, little kitty, come on.

318
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:35,241
- For $2,000 you're on my side now?
- Yeah.

319
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:38,043
You're the one who's father
was drowning cats, remember?

320
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:40,117
- Come on, kitty. Come on.
- Come to mama.

321
00:38:42,186 --> 00:38:45,087
Don't worry about these big things,
that's special effects.

322
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:48,989
Okay, okay.

323
00:38:52,063 --> 00:38:52,791
Okay!

324
00:38:52,863 --> 00:38:53,795
Now.

325
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:03,798
Come on!

326
00:39:10,781 --> 00:39:13,272
There he is.

327
00:39:13,417 --> 00:39:16,045
There's the guy.

328
00:39:16,987 --> 00:39:18,784
You were just lucky.

329
00:39:18,923 --> 00:39:21,289
Lucky? I think he knows
you bet against him.

330
00:39:21,392 --> 00:39:23,860
You win some, you lose some.

331
00:39:24,061 --> 00:39:26,325
You guys go on. Go see Dean Martin.

332
00:39:26,964 --> 00:39:30,422
I'll take this guy home,
give him a bowl of milk.

333
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:32,660
I think he earned it. Goodbye, sweetie.

334
00:39:32,737 --> 00:39:34,295
You sure you're not coming?

335
00:39:34,438 --> 00:39:37,100
I got to finish that business I talked about.

336
00:39:37,174 --> 00:39:39,506
- Have a good time.
- You want to get me a cab?

337
00:39:43,681 --> 00:39:45,046
Get Ducky on the radio.

338
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:47,775
Tell him to nail the bastard.

339
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:48,715
Good night.

340
00:39:50,454 --> 00:39:51,443
Thanks.

341
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:54,021
I still don't see why
you can't come with me.

342
00:39:54,091 --> 00:39:57,254
Because we're broke.
When you decided to leave with me...

343
00:39:57,428 --> 00:40:01,091
...you descended into a whole new plane
of financial existence, my dear.

344
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:04,524
I'm trying to make the decompression
as painless as possible.

345
00:40:04,668 --> 00:40:06,397
- I don't care.
- I do!

346
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:09,030
The Armbruster Hotel in New York.
I'll see you there.

347
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,499
I've got to wait till the banks open.

348
00:40:11,642 --> 00:40:15,339
I can crack open one of my piggy banks.
We got to have something to live on.

349
00:40:16,147 --> 00:40:18,513
Johnny, you don't know
how dangerous he is.

350
00:40:18,616 --> 00:40:22,177
I know exactly what he is,
that's why you're getting on the bus.

351
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:23,880
After you give me a kiss.

352
00:40:31,662 --> 00:40:32,754
Darling.

353
00:40:32,897 --> 00:40:34,159
Go.

354
00:40:57,021 --> 00:40:58,283
Hey!

355
00:40:58,589 --> 00:41:01,080
It's for horses. Sometimes for cows.

356
00:41:01,325 --> 00:41:03,657
Pigs don't eat it
because they don't know how.

357
00:41:08,432 --> 00:41:10,559
Get his keys, come on.

358
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:14,404
You're in grade-A trouble, buckaroo.
Come on.

359
00:41:14,505 --> 00:41:15,836
Move!

360
00:41:51,775 --> 00:41:53,106
Okay, blow.

361
00:41:54,311 --> 00:41:55,710
Come on, kid.

362
00:41:57,581 --> 00:42:00,175
Pigs don't eat it,
because they don't know how.

363
00:42:01,952 --> 00:42:04,284
When Ducky says that, it means shut up.

364
00:42:04,955 --> 00:42:05,785
Does it?

365
00:42:05,923 --> 00:42:08,084
Yeah. It's like a joke, you know?

366
00:42:32,116 --> 00:42:33,447
Close the door!

367
00:42:46,196 --> 00:42:48,357
<i>I've set you up, Mr. Norris.</i>

368
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:51,691
<i>In 10 minutes, Albert will call the police...</i>

369
00:42:51,869 --> 00:42:56,602
<i>... and tell them a tale of heroin,
1970 Mustangs...</i>

370
00:42:57,274 --> 00:42:59,742
...aging tennis pros with drug records.

371
00:43:00,044 --> 00:43:02,740
You'll be eagerly sought after, Mr. Norris.

372
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:05,381
Unless I tell you where Marcia is.

373
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:11,316
With you gone, she'd come back.
She has nowhere else to go.

374
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:15,659
Now as for you, when you get out of jail...

375
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:20,052
...you'll be more concerned
with your arthritis than your libido.

376
00:43:21,231 --> 00:43:25,759
Unless you want to take the wager
I'm offering.

377
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:31,638
Hey, come here.

378
00:43:39,016 --> 00:43:41,382
I want to show you something.

379
00:43:51,595 --> 00:43:54,621
Now look down there
and tell me what you see.

380
00:43:54,932 --> 00:43:56,092
Look, go ahead.

381
00:43:59,236 --> 00:44:00,396
The street.

382
00:44:00,771 --> 00:44:02,602
No, there. There.

383
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:04,872
A ledge.

384
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:07,500
- The ledge.
- What is all this about?

385
00:44:09,446 --> 00:44:11,778
The wager I am proposing is very simple.

386
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:17,184
The top of the building
is sort of an architectural monstrosity.

387
00:44:17,621 --> 00:44:19,179
All little nooks...

388
00:44:19,256 --> 00:44:20,655
...and crannies...

389
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:22,689
...weird wind comes around.

390
00:44:23,961 --> 00:44:25,826
You walk all the way around...

391
00:44:25,963 --> 00:44:28,659
...the scag will be removed from the car.

392
00:44:28,766 --> 00:44:31,530
You get the money and you get my wife.

393
00:44:31,735 --> 00:44:32,759
You're crazy.

394
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:38,267
You lose your balance,
lose your balance once...

395
00:44:55,959 --> 00:44:57,756
That's the bet, Mr. Norris.

396
00:44:57,961 --> 00:45:01,453
You get the girl, get the gold watch,
you get everything!

397
00:45:02,166 --> 00:45:05,135
Or you get a lot of straight time
in Rahway Prison.

398
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:34,620
You welsh on your bets?

399
00:45:38,202 --> 00:45:40,193
I never welshed on a bet in my life.

400
00:45:45,609 --> 00:45:47,372
Hey, Sebastian.

401
00:45:47,711 --> 00:45:50,475
Hey, Sebastian.
Sebastian appears to like you.

402
00:45:50,681 --> 00:45:52,342
Maybe that's a good sign.

403
00:46:03,827 --> 00:46:07,661
Good, good. Well begun is half done.

404
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:36,453
The ledge is about five inches wide.

405
00:46:36,727 --> 00:46:40,254
Once you're on it,
it looks more like three, doesn't it?

406
00:46:41,265 --> 00:46:43,165
Two, yeah.

407
00:46:44,835 --> 00:46:45,824
One?

408
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:48,094
How the hell would you know?

409
00:46:50,774 --> 00:46:53,265
Mr. Norris, you know what I think?

410
00:46:54,344 --> 00:46:58,974
I think you'll stand there
for a while then climb back up.

411
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:02,285
If your arms still have the strength
left to do that.

412
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,754
I don't think you got the guts.

413
00:47:06,023 --> 00:47:08,218
I just don't think you got the guts.

414
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:34,517
Boogie, boogie.

415
00:47:38,822 --> 00:47:40,289
You bastard!

416
00:47:40,657 --> 00:47:42,887
I want to keep you on your toes.

417
00:48:01,345 --> 00:48:03,210
Get out of here.

418
00:49:58,061 --> 00:50:00,256
You bastard!

419
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:03,159
Just keeping you on your toes!

420
00:50:40,771 --> 00:50:44,571
What's the matter with you? Knock it off.
Where's your sense of humor?

421
00:51:13,837 --> 00:51:14,929
Buzz off.

422
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:28,074
Shove off!

423
00:51:52,976 --> 00:51:54,204
You little pecker!

424
00:52:30,747 --> 00:52:32,078
Try this...

425
00:52:33,049 --> 00:52:34,812
...you flying shithouse!

426
00:52:45,128 --> 00:52:46,322
Mr. Norris!

427
00:53:00,577 --> 00:53:02,568
What do you think, Mr. Norris?

428
00:53:02,646 --> 00:53:06,412
Is this more fun than human beings
should be allowed to have or what?

429
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:08,515
I'll kill you!

430
00:53:08,752 --> 00:53:10,276
No, Mr. Norris.

431
00:53:10,453 --> 00:53:12,614
But I will most assuredly kill you...

432
00:53:12,789 --> 00:53:15,155
...if you don't get moving in 30 seconds!

433
00:53:16,493 --> 00:53:19,121
The valve was only half-opened that time.

434
00:53:19,296 --> 00:53:20,888
If I open it all the way...

435
00:53:20,964 --> 00:53:22,795
...I'll blow you out of this hole.

436
00:53:23,333 --> 00:53:24,493
Move!

437
00:53:26,169 --> 00:53:27,693
I'll kill you.

438
00:53:32,776 --> 00:53:34,334
Wait and see.

439
00:56:26,516 --> 00:56:28,381
Put it in the shopping bag.

440
00:56:28,685 --> 00:56:31,483
- On top of the money?
- Put it in the shopping bag.

441
00:56:32,655 --> 00:56:34,646
Here, put that down there.

442
00:56:36,593 --> 00:56:40,654
Now you come in when I say,
"All right, all right, Mr. Norris." Got that?

443
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:45,560
- I got it. "All right, Mr. Norris."
- No. "All right, all right, Mr. Norris."

444
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:49,193
- I got it. "All right, Mr. Norris."
- Forget it. Go ahead.

445
00:57:08,458 --> 00:57:10,926
All right, all right, Mr. Norris.

446
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:13,589
I told you I don't welsh.

447
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:20,327
No?

448
00:57:20,837 --> 00:57:22,964
I'm just an extremely poor loser.

449
00:57:23,807 --> 00:57:25,434
I promised you three things:

450
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:28,005
You have your car, clean.

451
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:29,544
You have the money.

452
00:57:30,814 --> 00:57:32,372
And of course...

453
00:57:33,349 --> 00:57:34,941
...you have my wife.

454
00:57:39,522 --> 00:57:40,716
Jesus!

455
00:57:41,524 --> 00:57:43,515
How do you like that, Mr. Norris?

456
00:57:43,693 --> 00:57:44,785
God!

457
00:57:45,562 --> 00:57:46,824
Albert!

458
00:57:57,974 --> 00:57:58,963
Albert!

459
00:58:15,692 --> 00:58:17,922
The money, nothing...

460
00:58:18,528 --> 00:58:20,519
Nothing. Chicken feed.

461
00:58:21,831 --> 00:58:23,799
I can get you $100,000.

462
00:58:24,434 --> 00:58:25,526
$500,000!

463
00:58:26,903 --> 00:58:28,131
$1 million, Norris.

464
00:58:30,373 --> 00:58:33,206
In a Swiss bank. How about that?

465
00:58:35,845 --> 00:58:37,574
$1 million.

466
00:58:42,785 --> 00:58:43,911
I don't think so!

467
00:58:44,654 --> 00:58:46,815
$2 million! $2 million!

468
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:54,026
No.

469
00:58:54,464 --> 00:58:55,897
I got an idea.

470
00:58:56,733 --> 00:58:59,167
I'll make you a little bet. It's not a wager...

471
00:58:59,235 --> 00:59:02,432
...because I'm not a big fancy hood
like you.

472
00:59:03,606 --> 00:59:06,439
I'm just an over-the-hill tennis bum...

473
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:13,482
...with a dead girlfriend.
It's a simple little bet.

474
00:59:21,991 --> 00:59:24,323
$5 million! $5 million.

475
00:59:25,628 --> 00:59:27,687
I'll give you anything you want.

476
00:59:27,764 --> 00:59:30,892
You're right, Mr. Cressner,
this is a lot of fun.

477
00:59:30,967 --> 00:59:34,266
You got to be joking, Norris.
It's a joke! Tell me it's a joke!

478
00:59:34,337 --> 00:59:35,827
Tell me it's a joke...

479
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:38,138
Don't shoot!

480
00:59:42,512 --> 00:59:45,106
Just keeping you on your toes,
Mr. Cressner.

481
00:59:45,281 --> 00:59:46,839
Keep moving.

482
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:51,117
The next one might be a lot closer.

483
00:59:54,824 --> 00:59:55,950
Move!

484
01:00:12,108 --> 01:00:14,941
Norris, you son of a bitch!

485
01:00:35,198 --> 01:00:36,392
Get out of here!

486
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:40,159
Get out!

487
01:02:17,967 --> 01:02:19,798
Come on, you two. Lunchtime.

488
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:32,236
A cat!

489
01:02:40,690 --> 01:02:44,023
- Can we keep it?
- No. It probably belongs to somebody.

490
01:02:45,094 --> 01:02:48,222
Amanda, wait until I get a broom.
Wait a minute!

491
01:02:57,073 --> 01:02:59,473
Amanda, don't touch that cat.
It could bite you.

492
01:02:59,642 --> 01:03:02,475
He's won't bite me, it likes me.

493
01:03:02,545 --> 01:03:04,342
I want to keep him. No, don't.

494
01:03:04,413 --> 01:03:07,814
Amanda, we can't keep every single stray
that comes into this house.

495
01:03:07,884 --> 01:03:09,317
It could have a disease.

496
01:03:09,385 --> 01:03:11,444
But what if we have the vet check him?

497
01:03:11,687 --> 01:03:15,020
If the vet checks him out and says
there's nothing wrong with him...

498
01:03:15,091 --> 01:03:17,992
...and no one comes to get him,
then can we please have him?

499
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:21,393
Please? Pretty please? With sugar on top?

500
01:03:29,272 --> 01:03:30,500
What's your name?

501
01:03:33,543 --> 01:03:35,238
I can't hear you.

502
01:03:36,879 --> 01:03:39,370
Are you going to guard me? I hope so.

503
01:03:42,418 --> 01:03:45,785
- Can't General stay in my room tonight?
- No.

504
01:03:45,855 --> 01:03:46,753
Please?

505
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:50,850
No, the policy in this house
does not include bedroom privileges.

506
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:53,620
- But, Mom...
- Come on now, bedtime.

507
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:55,820
Good night, General.

508
01:04:25,595 --> 01:04:29,929
Amanda, turn off that TV set.
I'd like to talk to you.

509
01:04:32,101 --> 01:04:34,626
That cat was in your bedroom last night,
wasn't he?

510
01:04:35,938 --> 01:04:40,102
I found cat hairs all over your bedspread,
and a lot of your dolls were knocked over.

511
01:04:40,309 --> 01:04:41,139
Was he?

512
01:04:41,711 --> 01:04:44,271
I dreamed he was. Far out.

513
01:04:44,347 --> 01:04:49,216
He'll really be far out if that happens again
because I'll send him to the animal shelter.

514
01:04:49,285 --> 01:04:53,346
But, Mom, you can't do that!
That's not fair.

515
01:04:53,422 --> 01:04:55,754
Have you given
one minute's thought to Polly?

516
01:04:56,325 --> 01:04:59,385
General loves Polly. They get along great.

517
01:04:59,462 --> 01:05:01,589
Birds and cats do not get along great.

518
01:05:01,764 --> 01:05:04,597
In case you haven't watched
Sylvester and Tweety Bird on TV.

519
01:05:07,703 --> 01:05:12,163
General wouldn't do a thing to hurt Polly.
He's non-violent.

520
01:05:15,211 --> 01:05:19,477
I think it's really early to decide that.
I'd just wish you'd understand.

521
01:05:19,548 --> 01:05:24,212
Also, your mom just happened to have
a conference call with Nana last evening...

522
01:05:24,353 --> 01:05:28,414
...and Nana told your mom
that cats steal kids' breath.

523
01:05:29,625 --> 01:05:32,355
Why would General take my breath
if he has his own?

524
01:05:32,995 --> 01:05:36,988
Well, you have to put
all the animals outside in the night...

525
01:05:37,667 --> 01:05:39,635
...especially the cat animals.

526
01:05:39,702 --> 01:05:43,638
Because if you don't,
they climb up and sit on your chest...

527
01:05:43,973 --> 01:05:46,464
...and suck all your breath out like this...

528
01:05:49,045 --> 01:05:53,141
- That is very helpful, Hugh.
- Thank you very much.

529
01:05:54,784 --> 01:05:56,945
- Sit down and have your breakfast.
- No.

530
01:05:57,019 --> 01:06:01,820
Jokes about my mother's accent in the
morning have a way of killing my appetite.

531
01:06:12,568 --> 01:06:14,468
Non-violent, my ass.

532
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:23,241
I'm sorry we laughed at Nana.
But couldn't...

533
01:06:23,312 --> 01:06:27,009
No! The subject is closed.
Bus in 15 minutes.

534
01:07:06,489 --> 01:07:09,686
Mom, can't General just stay with me
until I fall asleep?

535
01:07:09,759 --> 01:07:14,423
No! Don't forget those back teeth.
That's where most of the food gets stuck.

536
01:07:16,699 --> 01:07:17,996
Get the back.

537
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:27,065
- Hi, doll.
- Hi, Daddy.

538
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:32,746
Amanda, it'd be a lot easier for me
to get General back in the house...

539
01:07:32,815 --> 01:07:35,306
...if I knew what these bad dreams
were all about.

540
01:07:35,684 --> 01:07:36,673
Why?

541
01:07:39,021 --> 01:07:42,980
Why? Because when you play the violin,
little girl...

542
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:46,392
...everybody listens, including your mom.
So, come on, tell me.

543
01:07:47,530 --> 01:07:50,693
I can only remember
that there's a monster in it.

544
01:07:51,033 --> 01:07:53,024
A monster? What's he like?

545
01:07:53,235 --> 01:07:56,068
Do you know that story about the goats?

546
01:07:56,472 --> 01:07:57,996
<i>The Three Billy Goats Gruff?</i>

547
01:07:58,074 --> 01:08:02,101
That's the one.
Well, this one lives in my wall right there.

548
01:08:09,819 --> 01:08:12,481
But General kept those dreams away
last night.

549
01:08:12,555 --> 01:08:14,989
Can't he come in for good, Daddy, please?

550
01:08:16,258 --> 01:08:19,921
You know, Amanda,
your mom is really serious about this.

551
01:08:20,129 --> 01:08:24,657
I know. Just like getting your back teeth,
that's where the food gets stuck...

552
01:08:24,733 --> 01:08:26,894
...and cats stealing kids' breath.

553
01:08:27,903 --> 01:08:32,237
Well, my making fun of Nana's accent
at the breakfast table...

554
01:08:32,408 --> 01:08:35,241
...probably didn't get us off
to the best of starts, but...

555
01:08:35,411 --> 01:08:38,175
...I might be able
to bring your mother around.

556
01:08:38,247 --> 01:08:41,045
- No promises, but maybe.
- No promises.

557
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:54,923
You know, Amanda,
there are no real monsters.

558
01:08:56,098 --> 01:08:58,430
Yeah, I guess I do.

559
01:08:59,101 --> 01:09:00,568
Okay. Go to sleep now.

560
01:09:03,038 --> 01:09:04,528
No bad dreams.

561
01:09:05,007 --> 01:09:06,599
No bad dreams.

562
01:09:25,127 --> 01:09:29,291
I think she was beginning to cry
when I kissed her good night tonight.

563
01:09:30,966 --> 01:09:32,627
Come on, Hugh.

564
01:09:43,812 --> 01:09:47,077
What do you say we talk about it
just a little bit, all right?

565
01:09:47,716 --> 01:09:50,378
Hugh, I just don't trust that cat.

566
01:13:54,730 --> 01:13:56,459
- What was that?
- What was that?

567
01:13:56,732 --> 01:13:58,393
I don't know. I'll go.

568
01:14:04,740 --> 01:14:06,765
General? Is that you?

569
01:14:19,188 --> 01:14:20,177
Mandy!

570
01:14:22,257 --> 01:14:23,952
Polly's dead.

571
01:14:24,793 --> 01:14:27,785
The monster in my wall killed Polly.

572
01:14:27,896 --> 01:14:28,885
Oh, no!

573
01:14:30,399 --> 01:14:31,388
I knew it!

574
01:14:32,468 --> 01:14:33,958
I knew it!

575
01:14:39,274 --> 01:14:41,105
I told you this would happen.

576
01:14:43,111 --> 01:14:44,442
Look at this!

577
01:14:47,349 --> 01:14:48,680
It's okay.

578
01:15:05,467 --> 01:15:08,766
- She's convinced the cat didn't do it.
- Yes, I know.

579
01:15:08,837 --> 01:15:12,364
She's convinced it was a troll
that got tired of living under a bridge...

580
01:15:12,441 --> 01:15:14,238
...and has moved into her wall.

581
01:15:14,309 --> 01:15:17,244
But she is 8 and you're 38,
and that cat's tracks...

582
01:15:17,312 --> 01:15:19,974
...were on her windowsill in Polly's blood.

583
01:15:20,315 --> 01:15:23,478
Now, are you going to take care of Polly
or do you want me to?

584
01:15:31,093 --> 01:15:32,754
Well, here he goes, killer.

585
01:15:34,963 --> 01:15:38,364
I would have thought that
you'd have cleared out of here by now, too.

586
01:15:38,433 --> 01:15:40,924
Your welcome is getting pretty threadbare.

587
01:15:45,507 --> 01:15:46,496
Come here.

588
01:15:48,510 --> 01:15:50,000
What have we got here?

589
01:15:51,780 --> 01:15:53,270
Who did that to you?

590
01:15:56,118 --> 01:15:58,279
Hey, the cat has a wound on his shoulder.

591
01:15:58,620 --> 01:15:59,780
So what?

592
01:16:02,057 --> 01:16:03,490
Seems like a big wound.

593
01:16:03,559 --> 01:16:06,926
Yeah, well, Polly got in one good peck
before that cat killed him.

594
01:16:06,995 --> 01:16:08,257
Good for Polly.

595
01:16:10,032 --> 01:16:13,524
I certainly never realized
that Polly had such a big pecker.

596
01:16:16,305 --> 01:16:19,638
You better get ready for work.
You're going to be late.

597
01:17:07,022 --> 01:17:08,512
Stay right there.

598
01:17:10,892 --> 01:17:11,881
Come on.

599
01:17:12,194 --> 01:17:14,856
Look, look. Good food.

600
01:17:19,701 --> 01:17:22,864
Come on, kitty.
Mama has your favorite food.

601
01:17:23,138 --> 01:17:25,971
Come on, you furry little bastard.
Come on.

602
01:17:35,784 --> 01:17:37,274
Going.

603
01:17:39,221 --> 01:17:40,882
Going.

604
01:17:49,398 --> 01:17:52,231
Your bird-killing days are over, my friend.

605
01:18:28,270 --> 01:18:30,431
<i>General!</i>

606
01:18:33,608 --> 01:18:35,439
General!

607
01:18:38,780 --> 01:18:40,805
General!

608
01:18:47,155 --> 01:18:49,316
General!

609
01:19:34,169 --> 01:19:36,160
Tomorrow's your big day, fellow.

610
01:19:49,251 --> 01:19:52,584
Do you think General ran away
because you thought he killed Polly?

611
01:19:53,021 --> 01:19:54,784
Honey, cats don't think.

612
01:19:54,856 --> 01:19:57,347
General does,
and he knows that you think...

613
01:19:57,425 --> 01:19:59,518
...that cats steal kids' breath!

614
01:21:59,481 --> 01:22:00,641
Hey!

615
01:24:51,586 --> 01:24:52,644
What was that?

616
01:24:56,291 --> 01:24:57,223
Mommy!

617
01:25:10,738 --> 01:25:12,831
- Mommy!
- Amanda!

618
01:25:13,575 --> 01:25:15,736
Get out of my way! Amanda!

619
01:25:27,288 --> 01:25:28,277
Amanda!

620
01:25:29,357 --> 01:25:30,346
Amanda!

621
01:25:46,374 --> 01:25:48,069
Get him, General! Get him!

622
01:25:50,712 --> 01:25:51,701
Hang on.

623
01:25:55,216 --> 01:25:56,205
Oh, no!

624
01:26:06,427 --> 01:26:08,122
Don't let him get away!

625
01:26:09,430 --> 01:26:10,419
Shit!

626
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:13,367
Please!

627
01:26:13,501 --> 01:26:14,490
Amanda!

628
01:26:15,236 --> 01:26:17,227
It's Mommy and Daddy, we're not angry.

629
01:26:18,139 --> 01:26:20,972
Hugh, what is wrong?
Why won't this door open?

630
01:26:22,310 --> 01:26:24,141
Come on, General. Get him!

631
01:26:37,492 --> 01:26:38,982
Come on, get him!

632
01:26:39,394 --> 01:26:40,383
Get him!

633
01:26:45,133 --> 01:26:46,623
Cream him!

634
01:27:00,215 --> 01:27:03,048
Watch out, General, watch out!

635
01:27:04,385 --> 01:27:05,818
Come on, get him!

636
01:27:06,321 --> 01:27:07,310
Amanda!

637
01:27:07,455 --> 01:27:09,286
General's fighting the monster!

638
01:27:10,959 --> 01:27:11,948
Amanda!

639
01:27:23,671 --> 01:27:25,662
Play it faster!

640
01:27:31,512 --> 01:27:33,343
Play it faster!

641
01:27:48,830 --> 01:27:49,762
General!

642
01:27:50,031 --> 01:27:51,020
Amanda!

643
01:27:58,273 --> 01:28:00,104
Where did he come from?

644
01:28:00,408 --> 01:28:03,002
Where did he come from?
Give me that cat.

645
01:28:03,244 --> 01:28:04,233
Amanda!

646
01:28:04,312 --> 01:28:05,973
- Give me that cat!
- Quiet!

647
01:28:09,250 --> 01:28:11,616
It wasn't General
that wanted to take my breath.

648
01:28:11,686 --> 01:28:14,280
It was the monster, and General fixed him.

649
01:28:14,989 --> 01:28:16,650
You've got to believe me!

650
01:28:17,392 --> 01:28:19,121
Amanda, where did it go?

651
01:28:19,994 --> 01:28:23,828
General played him on the record player
and swoosh...

652
01:28:24,032 --> 01:28:27,024
...zoom, into the fan and he got smushed.

653
01:28:34,776 --> 01:28:36,437
Oh, my God!

654
01:28:38,079 --> 01:28:41,242
Hugh, what do you think it is?

655
01:28:56,664 --> 01:28:58,632
That's where he came from. There!

656
01:28:58,700 --> 01:29:02,101
Right there in my wall just like I told you.

657
01:29:09,477 --> 01:29:12,878
Amanda, whatever it was
that was in the wall, was it alone?

658
01:29:12,947 --> 01:29:16,542
- I mean, did it have any friends?
- I only saw one.

659
01:29:17,652 --> 01:29:20,485
Hugh? We're not going
to tell anybody about this.

660
01:29:20,688 --> 01:29:21,620
Are you kidding?

661
01:29:22,156 --> 01:29:24,124
Amanda, promise me...

662
01:29:24,192 --> 01:29:27,684
...promise me that you won't tell
any of your friends about this, okay?

663
01:29:28,396 --> 01:29:30,227
Well, that depends.

664
01:29:30,531 --> 01:29:32,192
Depends on what?

665
01:29:32,967 --> 01:29:35,128
On whether or not I can keep General.

666
01:29:35,770 --> 01:29:40,400
- And sleep with me at night.
- Amanda, that's blackmail.

667
01:31:26,747 --> 01:31:27,736
Hi.

668
01:31:28,736 --> 01:31:38,736
