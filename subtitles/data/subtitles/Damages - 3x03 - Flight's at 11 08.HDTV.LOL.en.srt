Previously on Damages:

2
00:00:02,451 --> 00:00:04,415
We've got money, Joe.
How much money?

3
00:00:04,416 --> 00:00:06,271
Enough for
generations.

4
00:00:06,272 --> 00:00:08,639
Your father's
going to go to jail.

5
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:09,707
You're my priority now.

6
00:00:09,708 --> 00:00:11,675
We never invested with
Louis Tobin.

7
00:00:11,676 --> 00:00:14,544
We gave our money to Leverett,
and Leverett gave it to Tobin.

8
00:00:14,545 --> 00:00:15,644
We've lost everything.

9
00:00:15,645 --> 00:00:17,879
I especially want to
thank my sister Ellen.

10
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,415
Even though, uh, I've got three years on
her, Ellie's always been my big sister.

11
00:00:22,416 --> 00:00:23,415
PARSONS Carrie.

12
00:00:23,416 --> 00:00:26,487
Do you know Danielle
Marchetti? No.

13
00:00:26,488 --> 00:00:30,726
Your father purchased $14,000
worth of clothes for Ms. Marchetti.

14
00:00:30,727 --> 00:00:32,161
Were you sleeping with her?

15
00:00:32,162 --> 00:00:33,563
Patty will never find
her.

16
00:00:33,564 --> 00:00:34,231
Where is she?

17
00:00:34,232 --> 00:00:35,166
Hello, Danielle.

18
00:00:35,167 --> 00:00:35,834
Get out.

19
00:00:35,835 --> 00:00:37,295
Did he throw money at
you right away?

20
00:00:37,296 --> 00:00:39,196
Get out!

21
00:00:40,527 --> 00:00:43,261
Danielle Marchetti applied
for an expedited passport.

22
00:00:43,262 --> 00:00:45,630
So Joe must have tipped off
his father that we're onto her.

23
00:00:45,631 --> 00:00:49,166
If we don't find Marchetti, she's
gonna be able to travel tonight.

24
00:00:54,772 --> 00:00:58,508
Danielle?

25
00:00:58,576 --> 00:00:59,375
No, no, no, no.

26
00:00:59,376 --> 00:01:02,312
Danielle?

27
00:01:13,585 --> 00:01:15,318
Are you Marchetti?

28
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:18,988
What?

29
00:01:19,056 --> 00:01:20,490
I'm picking up a Danielle

30
00:01:20,491 --> 00:01:24,326
Marchetti.

31
00:01:24,394 --> 00:01:26,261
Uh...

32
00:01:26,262 --> 00:01:27,662
Daniel, actually.

33
00:01:27,663 --> 00:01:28,696
Yeah, that's-that's me.

34
00:01:28,697 --> 00:01:31,465
You're heading to
Farmingdale Airport?

35
00:01:31,533 --> 00:01:32,399
Farmingdale?

36
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,200
Right.

37
00:01:33,201 --> 00:01:38,604
I know I'm a little early. I just figured
since your flight's international...

38
00:01:40,273 --> 00:01:41,106
I'm sorry.

39
00:01:41,107 --> 00:01:42,974
You got, uh,
luggage inside? I do.

40
00:01:42,975 --> 00:01:45,643
Uh, just, um- I'm sorry.

41
00:01:45,711 --> 00:01:47,578
I think someone screwed up.

42
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:51,481
Uh... this is embarrassing.

43
00:01:51,549 --> 00:01:53,716
Did... I was gonna drive myself.

44
00:01:53,784 --> 00:01:56,351
My assistant didn't-didn't call,
give you a call?

45
00:01:56,352 --> 00:01:57,719
No one called.

46
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,620
I'm sorry.

47
00:01:58,621 --> 00:02:00,755
Sometimes she's, um...

48
00:02:00,823 --> 00:02:02,523
She...

49
00:02:02,524 --> 00:02:03,991
It's a real trek out here,
you know?

50
00:02:03,992 --> 00:02:04,658
I understand that.

51
00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:06,093
Next time, you're gonna get
charged for it.

52
00:02:06,094 --> 00:02:06,960
Okay.

53
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:10,463
I appreciate it.

54
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,531
Thank you.

56
00:03:38,383 --> 00:03:40,751
Do we know what airport Danielle
Marchetti is flying out of?

57
00:03:40,752 --> 00:03:42,852
No, the State
Department checked for us.

58
00:03:42,853 --> 00:03:47,791
She's not scheduled on any private or commercial
flight leaving tonight from the tristate area.

59
00:03:47,792 --> 00:03:50,893
What about the address she used
on her passport application?

60
00:03:50,894 --> 00:03:51,760
It was bogus.

61
00:03:51,761 --> 00:03:54,529
But the health club where
she worked is still open.

62
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:55,396
I spoke to the manager.

63
00:03:55,397 --> 00:03:57,131
He's going to let
me check her file.

64
00:03:57,132 --> 00:03:58,365
Good.

65
00:03:58,366 --> 00:04:03,604
Even if we figure out what airport she's leaving from,
we don't have the authority to keep her in the country.

66
00:04:03,605 --> 00:04:05,338
Just find her.

67
00:04:05,339 --> 00:04:07,339
I'll worry about the rest.

68
00:04:11,144 --> 00:04:13,579
Is the plane on time?
I'm afraid not.

69
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,113
There's been a slight delay.

70
00:04:15,114 --> 00:04:16,781
Weather over the Gulf.

71
00:04:16,782 --> 00:04:18,282
What's the new departure time?

72
00:04:18,283 --> 00:04:20,250
It's scheduled for 11:08 p.m.

73
00:04:20,318 --> 00:04:22,218
Jesus.

74
00:04:22,285 --> 00:04:24,186
That's four hours from now.

75
00:04:24,253 --> 00:04:25,053
I know.

76
00:04:25,054 --> 00:04:27,221
But, uh, it's the
best we can do.

77
00:04:27,222 --> 00:04:28,855
You arrange
everything else?

78
00:04:28,856 --> 00:04:29,723
Yes, sir.

79
00:04:29,724 --> 00:04:31,758
And, uh, customs won't be a
problem.

80
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,994
Neither you nor Ms. Marchetti
are on the flight manifest.

81
00:04:34,996 --> 00:04:36,697
Let me know if anything
else comes up.

82
00:04:36,698 --> 00:04:39,801
We got to fly her out tonight.

83
00:04:44,106 --> 00:04:46,272
I'm so sorry about that, Janine.

84
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:51,074
No, um, Mrs. Tobin warned me when she
gave me your number, "He's a busy man."

85
00:04:51,075 --> 00:04:52,474
And I have been...

86
00:04:52,475 --> 00:04:55,011
and I've been wanting
to meet you for so long.

87
00:04:55,012 --> 00:04:57,746
Oh, well, Marilyn's wonderful.

88
00:04:57,747 --> 00:05:01,215
Yeah.

89
00:05:01,283 --> 00:05:03,550
They, um, they don't let Mrs.

90
00:05:03,618 --> 00:05:05,185
Tobin come in the salon anymore,

91
00:05:05,186 --> 00:05:07,053
so I go to her.

92
00:05:07,054 --> 00:05:08,821
And I'm-I'm happy to do it.

93
00:05:08,822 --> 00:05:10,623
You know, she-she really got a

94
00:05:10,624 --> 00:05:12,991
bad rap, what, with her husband

95
00:05:13,059 --> 00:05:16,460
and all of that.

96
00:05:16,528 --> 00:05:20,397
She sure did.

97
00:05:20,465 --> 00:05:23,466
Um, you are a lawyer?

98
00:05:23,467 --> 00:05:25,434
I am.

99
00:05:26,336 --> 00:05:27,970
Um, how is that?

100
00:05:27,971 --> 00:05:28,904
Do you ever feel

101
00:05:28,905 --> 00:05:31,139
blessed?

102
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:33,340
Um, I-I do.

103
00:05:33,408 --> 00:05:34,641
I do, absolutely.

104
00:05:34,642 --> 00:05:37,177
I have a lot of great friends

105
00:05:37,244 --> 00:05:39,178
down at the salon.

106
00:05:39,246 --> 00:05:40,313
Well, that's how I

107
00:05:40,314 --> 00:05:43,715
feel about the law.

108
00:05:45,684 --> 00:05:46,617
Heading out?

109
00:05:46,618 --> 00:05:47,284
Dinner with my

110
00:05:47,285 --> 00:05:48,418
family.

111
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:49,886
Uh-oh.

112
00:05:49,887 --> 00:05:52,055
An evening with Gary and Denise.

113
00:05:52,122 --> 00:05:52,955
My sister's

114
00:05:52,956 --> 00:05:54,056
coming from Oregon.

115
00:05:54,057 --> 00:05:55,958
Oh, triple whammy.

116
00:05:56,026 --> 00:05:56,758
No, it's great.

117
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:57,926
I get to meet my niece.

118
00:05:57,927 --> 00:05:59,060
Oh, that's right.

119
00:05:59,061 --> 00:06:00,194
You're an aunt now.

120
00:06:00,195 --> 00:06:01,128
Crazy, huh?

121
00:06:01,129 --> 00:06:02,195
Is, uh,

122
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:03,096
what's-his-name coming?

123
00:06:03,097 --> 00:06:04,063
The husband.

124
00:06:04,064 --> 00:06:04,964
No. Thank God.

125
00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:05,698
He's stuck at work.

126
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:06,665
His boss wouldn't let him off.

127
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:07,666
Well, sounds like a

128
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:08,333
party.

129
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:09,101
Rock it out.

130
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:09,935
You gonna hold down

131
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:10,602
the fort?

132
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:11,370
Yeah, someone's got

133
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,037
to.

134
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,138
This Tobin case is never

135
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:13,939
gonna end.

136
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:14,773
Have a blast.

137
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:17,744
Thank you.

138
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,545
Mmm.

139
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:20,880
Mmm?

140
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:22,048
See what I mean?

141
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:22,882
I do.

142
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:24,783
It's very, um, effervescent.

143
00:06:24,785 --> 00:06:25,585
Wait, is that, is that a word?

144
00:06:25,586 --> 00:06:26,252
Yes.

145
00:06:26,253 --> 00:06:26,920
Is it? Okay.

146
00:06:26,921 --> 00:06:27,620
It certainly is a

147
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:28,287
word.

148
00:06:28,288 --> 00:06:29,655
Oh.

149
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:30,322
Darn it.

150
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:31,690
I'm sor- Last one, Janine.

151
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:34,159
Sorry.

152
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,327
Okay, this is a client.

153
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:37,596
So I'll-I'll be a minute.

154
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:38,830
Just take your time,

155
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:41,232
'cause I wld hate to stand in

156
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,200
the way of justice.

157
00:06:44,535 --> 00:06:47,103
One second.

158
00:06:47,171 --> 00:06:49,071
Hey, Joe, what's up?

159
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:51,606
Wait.

160
00:06:51,607 --> 00:06:53,607
Tell me where you are.

161
00:06:56,444 --> 00:06:57,744
Patty.

162
00:06:57,745 --> 00:06:59,345
Ellen.

163
00:06:59,346 --> 00:07:00,313
ARSONSWhat are you doing

164
00:07:00,314 --> 00:07:00,980
here?

165
00:07:00,981 --> 00:07:03,582
Seeing your boss.

166
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:04,783
You're leaving early.

167
00:07:04,784 --> 00:07:06,318
I'm going to Jersey.

168
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,153
Parsons family dinner.

169
00:07:08,154 --> 00:07:09,287
Oh.

170
00:07:09,288 --> 00:07:11,321
The name you gave Tom turned out

171
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:12,389
to be significant.

172
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,156
Have you subpoenaed

173
00:07:13,157 --> 00:07:13,823
her?

174
00:07:13,824 --> 00:07:14,757
Trying to.

175
00:07:14,758 --> 00:07:16,158
She's, uh, not very keen on

176
00:07:16,159 --> 00:07:18,059
being found.

177
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,694
But thank you.

178
00:07:20,762 --> 00:07:22,596
And if you ever need anything...

179
00:07:22,597 --> 00:07:23,330
No.

180
00:07:23,331 --> 00:07:24,331
It was a one-off.

181
00:07:24,332 --> 00:07:26,065
Tom came to me and I was happy

182
00:07:26,066 --> 00:07:26,799
to help.

183
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,433
But, uh, that's it for me in

184
00:07:28,434 --> 00:07:30,135
the Tobin case.

185
00:07:30,136 --> 00:07:31,171
Are you sure you don't

186
00:07:31,172 --> 00:07:34,613
want to stick around?

187
00:07:34,681 --> 00:07:36,281
I think this witness is trying

188
00:07:36,282 --> 00:07:37,315
to flee the country.

189
00:07:37,316 --> 00:07:40,552
It could be an exciting night.

190
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:41,386
I bet.

191
00:07:41,387 --> 00:07:42,487
But, uh, I have a train to

192
00:07:42,488 --> 00:07:43,288
catch, so...

193
00:07:43,289 --> 00:07:44,155
Oh, right, right,

194
00:07:44,156 --> 00:07:45,123
right, of course.

195
00:07:45,124 --> 00:07:46,690
Family.

196
00:07:46,691 --> 00:07:48,725
Your top priority.

197
00:07:57,534 --> 00:07:58,767
I'm sorry, I'm

198
00:07:58,768 --> 00:08:00,702
running a little late.

199
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:02,504
Well, it's almost 7:30.

200
00:08:02,505 --> 00:08:03,171
I know.

201
00:08:03,172 --> 00:08:04,672
I'm trying to find a witness

202
00:08:04,673 --> 00:08:06,340
who may be fleeing the country.

203
00:08:06,341 --> 00:08:07,174
Doesn't Patty have

204
00:08:07,175 --> 00:08:08,742
anyone eo that?

205
00:08:08,743 --> 00:08:09,843
No, I don't want

206
00:08:09,844 --> 00:08:10,777
anyone else doing it.

207
00:08:10,778 --> 00:08:11,745
It too important.

208
00:08:11,746 --> 00:08:12,946
pents are

209
00:08:12,947 --> 00:08:14,214
gonna be here any minute, and

210
00:08:14,215 --> 00:08:15,481
I thought we were going to tell

211
00:08:15,482 --> 00:08:16,149
them together.

212
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:16,849
We will.

213
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:18,283
Look, I'm the one who got your

214
00:08:18,284 --> 00:08:20,553
parents to invest with Tobin.

215
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,454
I want to be the one to explain

216
00:08:22,455 --> 00:08:23,255
it to them.

217
00:08:23,256 --> 00:08:24,489
You really think this

218
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:25,624
witness could help your case?

219
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:27,459
This is the best lead

220
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:30,327
we have right now.

221
00:08:30,395 --> 00:08:31,461
All right, babe.

222
00:08:31,462 --> 00:08:32,995
Do what you have to do.

223
00:08:32,996 --> 00:08:34,063
Look, have dinner

224
00:08:34,064 --> 00:08:35,230
with your folks.

225
00:08:35,231 --> 00:08:36,831
I promise you I'll be there

226
00:08:36,832 --> 00:08:37,898
by dessert.

227
00:08:37,899 --> 00:08:40,433
We'll tell them together.

228
00:09:05,191 --> 00:09:07,692
What happened?

229
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,094
I hit you with my car.

230
00:09:14,099 --> 00:09:15,198
Oh, yeah, I was

231
00:09:15,199 --> 00:09:17,033
looking for my cat.

232
00:09:17,034 --> 00:09:18,368
Yeah. Put this o

233
00:09:18,369 --> 00:09:20,369
your face.

234
00:09:23,707 --> 00:09:24,440
How long was I

235
00:09:24,441 --> 00:09:26,508
out?

236
00:09:26,576 --> 00:09:28,243
I don't know.

237
00:09:28,244 --> 00:09:30,878
Just a little while.

238
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:33,347
Oh, my head hurts.

239
00:09:33,415 --> 00:09:35,649
I called for help,

240
00:09:35,717 --> 00:09:38,184
so don't worry.

241
00:09:42,989 --> 00:09:44,123
My whole side

242
00:09:44,124 --> 00:09:45,190
is sore.

243
00:09:45,191 --> 00:09:47,192
Here.

244
00:09:50,629 --> 00:09:52,529
What time is it?

245
00:09:52,564 --> 00:09:53,464
Why, you have someplace

246
00:09:53,465 --> 00:09:56,333
to be?

247
00:09:59,169 --> 00:10:01,170
Stay down.

248
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:07,543
Oh!

249
00:10:07,611 --> 00:10:08,443
Jesus, Joe,

250
00:10:08,444 --> 00:10:11,346
what's going on?

251
00:10:11,414 --> 00:10:13,481
Where is she?

252
00:10:13,549 --> 00:10:15,349
In the other room.

253
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:16,484
What are you

254
00:10:16,485 --> 00:10:18,819
doing here?

255
00:10:22,787 --> 00:10:24,619
Did you know my father

256
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,886
was sleeping with Danielle

257
00:10:25,887 --> 00:10:26,720
Marchetti?

258
00:10:26,721 --> 00:10:27,387
No.

259
00:10:27,388 --> 00:10:28,387
Did you, Lenny?

260
00:10:28,388 --> 00:10:29,789
No. He told me

261
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:32,324
after you confronted him.

262
00:10:35,393 --> 00:10:37,394
I'm sorry.

263
00:10:38,396 --> 00:10:39,729
Why is he putting her

264
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:40,797
on an airplane tonight?

265
00:10:40,798 --> 00:10:42,098
All he said was

266
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:43,399
he didn't want Patty Hewes

267
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,367
questioning her.

268
00:10:44,368 --> 00:10:47,103
Oh. Then Danielle must

269
00:10:47,171 --> 00:10:49,306
know about the money.

270
00:10:49,374 --> 00:10:50,040
Jesus Christ!

271
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:51,709
Could he be that goddamn stupid

272
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:53,377
to put his whole family's future

273
00:10:53,378 --> 00:10:56,212
in her hands?

274
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,847
Her?!

275
00:10:57,848 --> 00:10:59,882
Joe, I'm as much in

276
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,518
the dark as you are.

277
00:11:02,586 --> 00:11:04,686
But she is in there, and we need

278
00:11:04,754 --> 00:11:06,521
to decide what to do with her.

279
00:11:06,522 --> 00:11:08,389
We don't have a choice.

280
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:09,857
If she knows about the money,

281
00:11:09,858 --> 00:11:11,725
we get her out of the country.

282
00:11:11,726 --> 00:11:13,593
I think we have to

283
00:11:13,594 --> 00:11:15,594
do that.

284
00:11:24,468 --> 00:11:25,235
Patty?

285
00:11:25,236 --> 00:11:26,703
Curtis, I was asked

286
00:11:26,704 --> 00:11:27,837
to wait.

287
00:11:27,838 --> 00:11:29,371
You're off to a fund-raiser?

288
00:11:29,372 --> 00:11:30,405
A wake, actually.

289
00:11:30,406 --> 00:11:31,205
My great-uncle.

290
00:11:31,206 --> 00:11:32,407
Oh, I'm sorry.

291
00:11:32,408 --> 00:11:33,775
Man was a prick,

292
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:34,642
but thanks.

293
00:11:34,643 --> 00:11:35,576
I'm afraid this

294
00:11:35,577 --> 00:11:38,279
is urgent.

295
00:11:38,346 --> 00:11:40,480
Danielle Marchetti.

296
00:11:40,548 --> 00:11:42,115
She used to be the

297
00:11:42,116 --> 00:11:43,183
receptionist at Louis Tobin's

298
00:11:43,184 --> 00:11:43,850
health club.

299
00:11:43,851 --> 00:11:44,717
Your people questioned her

300
00:11:44,718 --> 00:11:46,218
a couple of months ago.

301
00:11:46,219 --> 00:11:47,019
And?

302
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,687
She and Tobin may have

303
00:11:48,688 --> 00:11:49,988
been having an affair, but

304
00:11:49,989 --> 00:11:51,656
that's not the exciting part.

305
00:11:51,657 --> 00:11:52,824
You think she might

306
00:11:52,825 --> 00:11:53,758
be involved in the fraud?

307
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:54,425
Yes.

308
00:11:54,426 --> 00:11:55,326
I also think she's trying

309
00:11:55,327 --> 00:11:57,328
to flee the country tonight.

310
00:11:59,497 --> 00:12:01,364
Uh, Sheryl, can you

311
00:12:01,365 --> 00:12:02,765
track down Judge Reilly's cell

312
00:12:02,766 --> 00:12:03,766
number for me?

313
00:12:03,767 --> 00:12:05,167
You have a flight number?

314
00:12:05,168 --> 00:12:06,001
Not yet.

315
00:12:06,002 --> 00:12:07,268
So you'll talk to Reilly?

316
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:07,936
Yeah.

317
00:12:07,937 --> 00:12:09,437
We'll need a warrant to detain

318
00:12:09,438 --> 00:12:10,104
Marchetti.

319
00:12:10,105 --> 00:12:12,106
What do you have on her?

320
00:12:16,343 --> 00:12:17,777
This is nothing.

321
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:19,244
Patty, you're asking me to

322
00:12:19,245 --> 00:12:20,345
detain her without evidence?

323
00:12:20,346 --> 00:12:21,546
I'm asking you to

324
00:12:21,547 --> 00:12:22,814
prevent a person of interest

325
00:12:22,815 --> 00:12:23,748
from fleeing the country.

326
00:12:23,749 --> 00:12:24,849
Based on a hunch?

327
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:25,616
You're the court-appointed

328
00:12:25,617 --> 00:12:26,651
trustee. There are rules.

329
00:12:26,652 --> 00:12:28,519
I know you're not used to that.

330
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,953
This woman could prove

331
00:12:29,954 --> 00:12:31,054
critical to our case.

332
00:12:31,055 --> 00:12:32,756
If you let her slip through our

333
00:12:32,757 --> 00:12:34,123
hands, we'll both regret it.

334
00:12:34,124 --> 00:12:35,157
Well, then give me

335
00:12:35,158 --> 00:12:37,626
something real.

336
00:12:37,694 --> 00:12:39,194
I'm sorry, I can't detain her

337
00:12:39,195 --> 00:12:41,296
without cause.

338
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:50,927
She's beautiful.

339
00:12:50,928 --> 00:12:52,829
She's perfect.

340
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:56,433
Here you go.

341
00:12:56,501 --> 00:12:57,601
Did you pump?

342
00:12:57,602 --> 00:12:59,537
No, it's organic
formula.

343
00:12:59,538 --> 00:13:00,604
Charlotte loves it.

344
00:13:00,605 --> 00:13:02,606
Oh, you're not
breast-feeding?

345
00:13:02,607 --> 00:13:06,510
Oh, she had trouble latching on at first,
and my nipples got all cracked, so...

346
00:13:07,512 --> 00:13:09,412
Not at my table.

347
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:11,447
Your father's
squeamish.

348
00:13:11,448 --> 00:13:13,549
I'm not squeamish.
I'm eating.

349
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:16,152
And I gotta tell ya, formula's
no good.

350
00:13:16,153 --> 00:13:17,053
It's fine.

351
00:13:17,054 --> 00:13:18,488
I looked it up online.

352
00:13:18,489 --> 00:13:20,457
There's nothing wrong
with formula.

353
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:24,310
I'm telling you girls,
when you were babies,

354
00:13:24,311 --> 00:13:28,163
your mother never
would've dreamed of it.

355
00:13:28,231 --> 00:13:30,500
Say, whatever happened
to that guy you were

356
00:13:30,501 --> 00:13:32,769
seeing with the, uh,
with the cowboy name?

357
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:33,837
Wes.

358
00:13:33,838 --> 00:13:36,106
Uh, that ended a few months
back.

359
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:38,342
We never even got to meet him.

360
00:13:38,343 --> 00:13:42,546
It's not a big deal. I don't
even know what he's doing anymore.

361
00:13:42,547 --> 00:13:44,749
I'm sorry that Eddie couldn't
make it.

362
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,484
I was looking forward to
seeing him.

363
00:13:46,485 --> 00:13:48,753
Yeah, he really
wanted to make the trip,

364
00:13:48,754 --> 00:13:50,322
but, you know, just bad timing.

365
00:13:50,323 --> 00:13:51,856
League semifinals.

366
00:13:51,857 --> 00:13:54,258
You know how Eddie is and
his sports.

367
00:13:54,259 --> 00:13:56,693
Bowling's not
a sport.

368
00:13:56,694 --> 00:13:59,762
I thought you said
he was working.

369
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,964
I did?

370
00:14:02,032 --> 00:14:02,698
Yes.

371
00:14:02,699 --> 00:14:05,435
Well, who can keep
track of these things?

372
00:14:05,436 --> 00:14:07,604
Nice priorities;

373
00:14:07,672 --> 00:14:10,340
bowling over family.

374
00:14:15,347 --> 00:14:18,916
Danielle stopped working at the
health club a few months ago,

375
00:14:18,917 --> 00:14:22,486
but she had a forwarding address that
she wants her last check to be sent to.

376
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:23,653
I'm heading there now.

377
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:25,121
All right.

378
00:14:25,122 --> 00:14:27,857
Where did you get
with the D.A.'s office?

379
00:14:27,858 --> 00:14:29,192
Nowhere.

380
00:14:29,193 --> 00:14:31,493
Curtis Gates is determined to
play by the rules.

381
00:14:31,494 --> 00:14:36,832
So unless we find her first, Danielle
Marchetti is free to leave the country.

382
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:39,835
All right, I'll be in
touch.

383
00:14:44,373 --> 00:14:46,740
You remember Lenny.

384
00:14:49,075 --> 00:14:50,975
Barely.

385
00:14:51,945 --> 00:14:54,513
It's been a while.

386
00:14:54,581 --> 00:14:55,949
I'm sorry this

387
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:58,417
happened, and I know you've

388
00:14:58,485 --> 00:15:00,617
been shaken up, but we need to

389
00:15:00,685 --> 00:15:01,685
know if you're on board with

390
00:15:01,686 --> 00:15:04,687
Louis' plan.

391
00:15:06,956 --> 00:15:07,989
We know about your

392
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,357
flight.

393
00:15:10,425 --> 00:15:12,127
I need to see

394
00:15:12,128 --> 00:15:12,794
a doctor.

395
00:15:12,795 --> 00:15:13,861
I've already

396
00:15:13,862 --> 00:15:16,597
arranged one. He's on his way.

397
00:15:19,034 --> 00:15:20,868
Okay. If he says

398
00:15:20,869 --> 00:15:23,304
I'm safe to fly, then I'll go.

399
00:15:23,372 --> 00:15:25,573
Your father wants me on that

400
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,640
plane.

401
00:15:26,641 --> 00:15:28,242
And you give my father

402
00:15:28,243 --> 00:15:31,579
anything he wants, don't you?

403
00:15:32,781 --> 00:15:33,948
Where are you

404
00:15:33,949 --> 00:15:34,615
going?

405
00:15:34,616 --> 00:15:36,617
I need some air.

406
00:15:43,055 --> 00:15:44,521
Hey, what happened to

407
00:15:44,522 --> 00:15:45,188
your wake?

408
00:15:45,189 --> 00:15:46,556
He'll still be dead

409
00:15:46,557 --> 00:15:47,223
at the funeral.

410
00:15:47,224 --> 00:15:48,190
Did you find anything?

411
00:15:48,191 --> 00:15:49,324
No, and I've been

412
00:15:49,325 --> 00:15:50,458
through everything we've got on

413
00:15:50,459 --> 00:15:51,125
Marchetti.

414
00:15:51,126 --> 00:15:52,226
Who did the interview

415
00:15:52,227 --> 00:15:53,560
with her at the-the health club.

416
00:15:53,561 --> 00:15:54,924
I did, a month and a

417
00:15:54,925 --> 00:15:55,592
half ago.

418
00:15:55,593 --> 00:15:57,257
I got the transcript right here.

419
00:15:57,258 --> 00:15:59,524
I don't like Patty knowing
something that we don't.

420
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:01,588
Boss, I'm telling you
I talked to Marchetti.

421
00:16:01,589 --> 00:16:02,487
There's nothing in here.

422
00:16:02,488 --> 00:16:05,115
Well, then why does Patty
want me to detain her?

423
00:16:05,116 --> 00:16:07,446
I don't know.
Maybe she's wrong.

424
00:16:07,447 --> 00:16:10,376
Or maybe she's keeping evidence
from us.

425
00:16:10,377 --> 00:16:12,406
Just give me that.

426
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:02,344
Danielle Marchetti?

427
00:17:10,652 --> 00:17:13,386
Miss Marchetti?

428
00:17:43,477 --> 00:17:46,012
âª âª

429
00:18:00,588 --> 00:18:02,488
Can I help you?

430
00:18:02,522 --> 00:18:05,090
Oh, uh, do you
live around here?

431
00:18:05,091 --> 00:18:06,191
Yeah, across the street.

432
00:18:06,192 --> 00:18:08,060
I'm looking for a

433
00:18:08,061 --> 00:18:09,561
Danielle Marchetti.

434
00:18:09,562 --> 00:18:11,194
I think she lives here.

435
00:18:11,195 --> 00:18:12,829
Danielle- yeah, sure.

436
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,396
Terrific girl.

437
00:18:14,397 --> 00:18:16,865
She helps me wife with
the shopping once in a while.

438
00:18:16,866 --> 00:18:18,600
When was the
last time you saw her?

439
00:18:18,601 --> 00:18:20,668
Well, I can't say for sure.

440
00:18:20,669 --> 00:18:22,036
She in some kind of trouble?

441
00:18:22,037 --> 00:18:25,104
No, I just, uh, I just
wanted to talk to her.

442
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:27,973
Well, I'll be
sure to tell her.

443
00:18:27,974 --> 00:18:29,107
Great. Thank you.

444
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:32,109
Good night.

445
00:18:40,115 --> 00:18:41,749
Hey, Patty.

446
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,383
I'm at Danielle Marchetti's.

447
00:18:43,384 --> 00:18:46,619
There's a car in the driveway,
but no one seems to be home.

448
00:18:47,622 --> 00:18:51,958
Um, call me when you get this.

449
00:18:52,025 --> 00:18:53,359
Hey, Deb.

450
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,995
No, I haven't been able to find
her.

451
00:18:56,996 --> 00:18:58,898
I don't think traffic's going to
be a problem.

452
00:18:58,899 --> 00:19:02,200
Just tell your mom and dad I'm
on my way.

453
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:23,220
Leonard, you still here?

454
00:19:26,524 --> 00:19:29,092
Thank you for
coming.

455
00:19:29,093 --> 00:19:31,794
You know, some guy was
snooping around out there.

456
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:32,961
Tom Shayes.

457
00:19:32,962 --> 00:19:34,463
He works for Patty Hewes.

458
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:35,330
Did he see you?

459
00:19:35,331 --> 00:19:36,632
No. He's gone now.

460
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:38,633
Good.

461
00:19:39,835 --> 00:19:41,269
This way, Dr. Brandt.

462
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:43,440
Patient's in here.

463
00:19:54,784 --> 00:19:58,454
Just relax.

464
00:19:58,521 --> 00:20:00,323
That hurt?

465
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:02,325
Yeah.

466
00:20:06,197 --> 00:20:08,331
What do you think?

467
00:20:08,399 --> 00:20:10,166
How did this happen?

468
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,501
She fell on the stairs.

469
00:20:14,403 --> 00:20:16,403
What-what does it matter?

470
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:18,370
Can she fly, Karl?

471
00:20:27,009 --> 00:20:27,708
Looking for

472
00:20:27,709 --> 00:20:28,374
something?

473
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:30,108
Someone.

474
00:20:30,109 --> 00:20:31,575
Having any luck?

475
00:20:31,576 --> 00:20:33,310
No.

476
00:20:33,311 --> 00:20:34,845
That's why I need you.

477
00:20:34,846 --> 00:20:36,813
Can you stick around here for

478
00:20:36,881 --> 00:20:37,947
a while?

479
00:20:37,948 --> 00:20:38,948
I have no plans.

480
00:20:38,949 --> 00:20:40,283
What do you have in mind?

481
00:20:40,284 --> 00:20:41,284
I'll tell you later.

482
00:20:41,285 --> 00:20:42,552
I have to make a phone call

483
00:20:42,553 --> 00:20:44,554
first.

484
00:20:46,056 --> 00:20:47,457
She's definitely

485
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:48,926
sustained a concussion.

486
00:20:48,927 --> 00:20:50,560
I'm a little worried that her

487
00:20:50,561 --> 00:20:51,927
rib may be broken.

488
00:20:51,928 --> 00:20:52,961
Karl, we need to

489
00:20:52,962 --> 00:20:55,563
know if she can fly.

490
00:20:55,631 --> 00:20:56,564
If this were any

491
00:20:56,565 --> 00:20:57,598
other patient, I'd say get her

492
00:20:57,599 --> 00:20:59,870
to a hospital.

493
00:20:59,938 --> 00:21:01,873
But if it's necessary...

494
00:21:01,941 --> 00:21:05,210
She needs to be watched to make

495
00:21:05,277 --> 00:21:07,412
sure there are no complications.

496
00:21:07,479 --> 00:21:08,780
What time's the flight?

497
00:21:08,781 --> 00:21:10,148
11:00.

498
00:21:10,149 --> 00:21:11,216
Observe her until

499
00:21:11,217 --> 00:21:12,284
then.

500
00:21:12,285 --> 00:21:13,753
And make sure her speech remains

501
00:21:13,754 --> 00:21:15,189
lucid.

502
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,090
Now if she seems to start to

503
00:21:17,091 --> 00:21:18,525
slur her words or seems a little

504
00:21:18,526 --> 00:21:20,426
light-headed, or if that nausea

505
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:22,529
get any worse, you need to get

506
00:21:22,596 --> 00:21:24,397
her right to a hospital.

507
00:21:24,398 --> 00:21:25,231
Karl, we can't

508
00:21:25,232 --> 00:21:26,265
thank you enough.

509
00:21:26,266 --> 00:21:28,702
Thank you.

510
00:21:32,873 --> 00:21:34,606
Are you okay?

511
00:21:34,607 --> 00:21:35,874
You-you look a little...

512
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:37,775
I'm fine.

513
00:21:42,785 --> 00:21:44,352
Leonard Winstone

514
00:21:44,353 --> 00:21:45,252
speaking.

515
00:21:45,253 --> 00:21:47,687
This is Patty Hewes.

516
00:21:47,755 --> 00:21:49,255
What a pleasant

517
00:21:49,256 --> 00:21:51,090
surprise.

518
00:21:51,091 --> 00:21:53,059
But, uh, perhaps I could call

519
00:21:53,126 --> 00:21:55,026
you back first thing tomorrow?

520
00:21:55,061 --> 00:21:56,761
I know about Danielle

521
00:21:56,762 --> 00:21:58,196
Marchetti.

522
00:21:58,197 --> 00:21:59,797
I'm not familiar

523
00:21:59,798 --> 00:22:00,999
with that name.

524
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,367
Then you won't mind if

525
00:22:02,368 --> 00:22:03,601
I leak her affair with Louis

526
00:22:03,602 --> 00:22:05,903
Tobin to the press.

527
00:22:05,971 --> 00:22:07,304
Ms. Hewes...

528
00:22:07,305 --> 00:22:08,572
I'm waiting for you in

529
00:22:08,573 --> 00:22:10,341
my office.

530
00:22:10,342 --> 00:22:12,242
In 30 minutes, everything I've

531
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:15,683
got gets released to the Post.

532
00:22:19,054 --> 00:22:20,455
What?

533
00:22:20,456 --> 00:22:21,823
I have to, uh, meet

534
00:22:21,824 --> 00:22:23,293
Patty Hewes.

535
00:22:23,294 --> 00:22:24,560
What does she want?

536
00:22:24,561 --> 00:22:25,327
Uh, she's

537
00:22:25,328 --> 00:22:26,328
threatening to release your

538
00:22:26,329 --> 00:22:28,332
father's affair to the press.

539
00:22:30,404 --> 00:22:31,372
This is Danielle

540
00:22:31,373 --> 00:22:32,473
Marchetti.

541
00:22:32,474 --> 00:22:35,009
We spoke a while back.

542
00:22:35,077 --> 00:22:36,878
I think that we need to talk

543
00:22:36,879 --> 00:22:38,814
again.

544
00:22:38,882 --> 00:22:40,116
Please call me.

545
00:22:40,117 --> 00:22:41,284
I'll stay here and

546
00:22:41,285 --> 00:22:43,285
watch her.

547
00:22:45,054 --> 00:22:46,020
You okay doing

548
00:22:46,021 --> 00:22:47,187
that?

549
00:22:47,188 --> 00:22:49,789
Why wouldn't I be?

550
00:22:49,857 --> 00:22:52,224
All right, uh,

551
00:22:52,292 --> 00:22:53,592
well, then meet me at

552
00:22:53,593 --> 00:22:55,927
Farmingdale Airport, hangar 6.

553
00:22:55,995 --> 00:22:57,995
Flight's at 11:08, okay?

554
00:23:01,431 --> 00:23:04,165
You find anything?

555
00:23:04,232 --> 00:23:05,632
No. You?

556
00:23:05,633 --> 00:23:07,000
Why the hell do you

557
00:23:07,001 --> 00:23:08,100
think I'm asking you?

558
00:23:08,101 --> 00:23:08,968
Call your wife.

559
00:23:08,969 --> 00:23:10,135
Tell her you're not coming home

560
00:23:10,136 --> 00:23:10,935
tonight.

561
00:23:10,936 --> 00:23:12,936
I'm not married.

562
00:23:14,538 --> 00:23:17,171
Jesus- how long have I worked

563
00:23:17,239 --> 00:23:19,405
here?

564
00:23:30,811 --> 00:23:31,811
Dad, where does

565
00:23:31,812 --> 00:23:33,378
this go?

566
00:23:33,379 --> 00:23:34,746
That one?

567
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:36,247
No idea.

568
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:38,248
Ask your mother.

569
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:41,586
You know, you're looking good,

570
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:43,188
kid.

571
00:23:43,189 --> 00:23:46,791
You seem happier than usual.

572
00:23:46,859 --> 00:23:49,527
Thanks, Dad.

573
00:24:01,736 --> 00:24:03,570
Hey, Mom, where's this go?

574
00:24:03,571 --> 00:24:05,271
Oh, I'll put it away,

575
00:24:05,272 --> 00:24:07,273
honey.

576
00:24:18,654 --> 00:24:20,021
I never meant to

577
00:24:20,022 --> 00:24:22,022
hurt you.

578
00:24:26,161 --> 00:24:29,098
You asked when it started.

579
00:24:29,166 --> 00:24:30,933
I'll tell you if you still want

580
00:24:30,934 --> 00:24:32,834
to know.

581
00:24:39,541 --> 00:24:41,041
Was it when you were still

582
00:24:41,042 --> 00:24:43,043
with me?

583
00:24:46,013 --> 00:24:48,280
Yes.

584
00:24:54,788 --> 00:24:57,123
When?

585
00:24:57,124 --> 00:24:58,357
About a year

586
00:24:58,358 --> 00:25:01,360
before you went into rehab.

587
00:25:04,231 --> 00:25:06,065
I'm sorry, Joe- you were a

588
00:25:06,066 --> 00:25:08,267
wreck.

589
00:25:08,335 --> 00:25:10,970
So you dump me, and you

590
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:13,039
start with my father.

591
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:18,778
I don't know what

592
00:25:18,779 --> 00:25:20,780
you want me to say.

593
00:25:27,154 --> 00:25:30,956
Joe...

594
00:25:31,024 --> 00:25:32,691
it wasn't what you think.

595
00:25:32,692 --> 00:25:34,259
You don't know what I

596
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:37,362
think.

597
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:39,331
He did it for you,

598
00:25:39,399 --> 00:25:40,799
you know.

599
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,801
What?

600
00:25:45,438 --> 00:25:47,372
You were a wreck,

601
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,840
so he did it.

602
00:25:48,841 --> 00:25:50,909
What? He did what?

603
00:25:50,977 --> 00:25:53,111
DANIELLE He was only

604
00:25:53,179 --> 00:25:56,281
on and off.

605
00:25:56,349 --> 00:26:00,351
So he did it.

606
00:26:00,418 --> 00:26:02,085
I don't... I don't want to wreck

607
00:26:02,086 --> 00:26:05,789
anymore.

608
00:26:05,857 --> 00:26:08,458
So you start with my father.

609
00:26:08,526 --> 00:26:10,059
Danielle...

610
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:13,062
what are you talking about?

611
00:26:13,129 --> 00:26:14,463
He wrecked it on

612
00:26:14,464 --> 00:26:15,397
and off.

613
00:26:15,398 --> 00:26:19,100
Danielle?

614
00:26:19,167 --> 00:26:20,467
Just say what you

615
00:26:20,468 --> 00:26:23,537
want me to say.

616
00:26:23,604 --> 00:26:27,473
JOE Shit.

617
00:26:27,541 --> 00:26:29,641
I thought you should

618
00:26:29,709 --> 00:26:32,844
see this.

619
00:26:32,911 --> 00:26:34,145
What is it?

620
00:26:34,146 --> 00:26:35,212
My statement to the

621
00:26:35,213 --> 00:26:38,214
press about Danielle Marchetti.

622
00:26:45,055 --> 00:26:46,922
It's very well

623
00:26:46,923 --> 00:26:50,226
written.

624
00:26:50,294 --> 00:26:52,394
But I don't think you want to do

625
00:26:52,462 --> 00:26:53,729
this.

626
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:55,130
Why not?

627
00:26:55,131 --> 00:26:56,064
Because not one

628
00:26:56,065 --> 00:26:58,066
word of that is true.

629
00:27:01,371 --> 00:27:03,238
Tell me where she is.

630
00:27:03,239 --> 00:27:04,706
I couldn't even

631
00:27:04,707 --> 00:27:06,274
tell you who she is.

632
00:27:06,275 --> 00:27:07,842
I'm trying to do you a

633
00:27:07,843 --> 00:27:09,444
favor, Mr. Winstone.

634
00:27:09,445 --> 00:27:11,880
The choice is yours.

635
00:27:11,947 --> 00:27:13,348
Either deal with this privately

636
00:27:13,349 --> 00:27:15,383
tonight, or explain to your

637
00:27:15,451 --> 00:27:17,119
clients in the morning why you

638
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,554
let the whole world know that

639
00:27:18,555 --> 00:27:20,555
Louis Tobin was screwing a towel

640
00:27:20,623 --> 00:27:22,625
girl half his age.

641
00:27:26,632 --> 00:27:28,532
I wonder what option Mrs. Tobin

642
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:32,502
would prefer?

643
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:35,305
I... appreciate the

644
00:27:35,372 --> 00:27:37,340
courtesy call, but I'm not

645
00:27:37,407 --> 00:27:38,674
worried about Marilyn.

646
00:27:38,675 --> 00:27:39,842
No?

647
00:27:39,843 --> 00:27:41,176
I'm just worried

648
00:27:41,177 --> 00:27:42,678
about the truth.

649
00:27:42,679 --> 00:27:44,846
And that woman...

650
00:27:44,914 --> 00:27:46,648
has nothing to do with the

651
00:27:46,649 --> 00:27:49,618
Tobins.

652
00:27:49,685 --> 00:27:51,419
Well, then it's my

653
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,421
mistake.

654
00:27:56,025 --> 00:27:58,059
I'm sorry for getting you all

655
00:27:58,127 --> 00:28:02,463
the way down here for nothing.

656
00:28:21,484 --> 00:28:22,317
Hello?

657
00:28:22,318 --> 00:28:23,752
Hey, it's Joe.

658
00:28:23,753 --> 00:28:25,620
Oh. How's the girl?

659
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:26,922
I don't...

660
00:28:26,923 --> 00:28:28,356
Something's wrong.

661
00:28:28,357 --> 00:28:29,991
Uh, her nose is bleeding, she

662
00:28:29,992 --> 00:28:31,892
can't finish sentences.

663
00:28:31,928 --> 00:28:33,361
Well, it could be a

664
00:28:33,362 --> 00:28:35,230
subdural hematoma- bleeding

665
00:28:35,231 --> 00:28:36,398
in the brain.

666
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:38,066
Well...

667
00:28:38,067 --> 00:28:39,468
what happens if she flies?

668
00:28:39,469 --> 00:28:40,603
Fly? She can't fly.

669
00:28:40,604 --> 00:28:42,205
You need to get her to a

670
00:28:42,206 --> 00:28:44,874
hospital.

671
00:28:44,941 --> 00:28:46,842
You hear me?

672
00:28:46,909 --> 00:28:48,610
Uh, yes.

673
00:28:48,611 --> 00:28:50,411
Joe... you put her on

674
00:28:50,412 --> 00:28:54,981
that plane, and she will die.

675
00:28:55,049 --> 00:28:57,583
I understand.

676
00:29:14,765 --> 00:29:15,965
Yeah?

677
00:29:15,966 --> 00:29:17,066
This is Chris Sharp

678
00:29:17,067 --> 00:29:18,334
from the District Attorney's

679
00:29:18,335 --> 00:29:19,035
Office.

680
00:29:19,036 --> 00:29:20,369
I'm returning Miss Marchetti's

681
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:22,370
call.

682
00:29:26,374 --> 00:29:28,409
Well, that's weird.

683
00:29:28,476 --> 00:29:31,011
A guy answered and he hung up.

684
00:29:31,078 --> 00:29:32,579
Next time keep your

685
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:35,748
damn cell phone on you. Okay?

686
00:29:39,218 --> 00:29:40,952
(Danielle sniffles, clears

687
00:29:40,953 --> 00:29:42,454
throat)

688
00:29:42,455 --> 00:29:43,889
What'd the doctor

689
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:46,858
say?

690
00:29:46,926 --> 00:29:48,526
Uh, he said you need to

691
00:29:48,527 --> 00:29:50,294
stay hydrated...

692
00:29:50,295 --> 00:29:53,163
and not to take any aspirin, but

693
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:56,399
it's nothing to worry about.

694
00:29:56,466 --> 00:29:58,467
Okay, good.

695
00:30:06,909 --> 00:30:09,377
You're good to go.

696
00:30:16,235 --> 00:30:18,135
Yeah.

697
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:20,804
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

698
00:30:20,872 --> 00:30:23,040
Hi, Ginny.

699
00:30:23,107 --> 00:30:25,007
Art.

700
00:30:26,344 --> 00:30:28,846
Hi. Sorry.

701
00:30:28,913 --> 00:30:29,980
Thank you.

702
00:30:29,981 --> 00:30:30,847
Get yourself the

703
00:30:30,848 --> 00:30:32,215
steak frites- it's delicious.

704
00:30:32,216 --> 00:30:33,483
I had the halibut.

705
00:30:33,484 --> 00:30:34,384
Uh, not a fan.

706
00:30:34,385 --> 00:30:35,552
I'm actually, I'm not

707
00:30:35,553 --> 00:30:36,386
very hungry.

708
00:30:36,387 --> 00:30:37,287
Um...

709
00:30:37,288 --> 00:30:38,654
Uh, Tom and I really

710
00:30:38,655 --> 00:30:40,123
just wanted to talk to you guys.

711
00:30:40,124 --> 00:30:41,257
Your husband's been

712
00:30:41,258 --> 00:30:42,558
running around all day- let

713
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:43,559
the man eat.

714
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,526
No, no, no,

715
00:30:44,527 --> 00:30:46,528
I'm-I'm-m fine.âª

716
00:30:56,707 --> 00:30:58,208
Um...

717
00:30:58,209 --> 00:31:00,543
I'm sorry, I just need one more

718
00:31:00,611 --> 00:31:01,644
minute.

719
00:31:01,645 --> 00:31:03,646
I'll be right back.

720
00:31:07,685 --> 00:31:09,285
Patty. Yeah.

721
00:31:09,286 --> 00:31:13,089
They were still in the house.

722
00:31:13,157 --> 00:31:15,058
Look, write this down.

723
00:31:15,159 --> 00:31:16,960
It's a license plate number.

724
00:31:16,961 --> 00:31:20,566
N- Z-E-4-7-4-5.

725
00:31:20,633 --> 00:31:22,101
Did you ever think

726
00:31:22,102 --> 00:31:23,336
when you were up here making out

727
00:31:23,337 --> 00:31:25,138
with Mike Delvecchio

728
00:31:25,139 --> 00:31:26,373
that you would be changing

729
00:31:26,374 --> 00:31:27,307
diapers someday?

730
00:31:27,308 --> 00:31:29,208
God, no.

731
00:31:33,247 --> 00:31:34,647
What's going on,

732
00:31:34,648 --> 00:31:35,648
Carrie?

733
00:31:35,649 --> 00:31:36,882
CARRIE What do you

734
00:31:36,883 --> 00:31:39,852
mean?

735
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:41,653
Downstairs...

736
00:31:41,654 --> 00:31:44,824
with the envelope- Mom looked

737
00:31:44,892 --> 00:31:46,893
like she was crying.

738
00:31:50,096 --> 00:31:53,097
Did something happen with Eddie?

739
00:31:55,834 --> 00:31:58,202
Um...

740
00:31:58,269 --> 00:31:59,837
I'm sure it's temporary.

741
00:31:59,838 --> 00:32:02,338
What's temporary?

742
00:32:02,406 --> 00:32:05,273
What did he do?

743
00:32:05,341 --> 00:32:07,142
Um...

744
00:32:07,143 --> 00:32:08,310
he... he left me three weeks

745
00:32:08,311 --> 00:32:09,377
ago, and I haven't heard from

746
00:32:09,378 --> 00:32:10,378
him since.

747
00:32:10,379 --> 00:32:11,579
Why didn't you tell

748
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:12,580
me?

749
00:32:12,581 --> 00:32:13,581
'Cause I just, I

750
00:32:13,582 --> 00:32:14,816
didn't want to bother you, you

751
00:32:14,817 --> 00:32:15,750
know?

752
00:32:15,751 --> 00:32:17,018
You have... too much on your

753
00:32:17,019 --> 00:32:18,019
plate already.

754
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:19,221
Don't be silly- let

755
00:32:19,222 --> 00:32:20,189
me help.

756
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:22,090
Don't ask Mom for money.

757
00:32:22,158 --> 00:32:23,291
They can't afford it.

758
00:32:23,292 --> 00:32:24,357
How much do you need?

759
00:32:24,358 --> 00:32:25,657
No. You know what?

760
00:32:25,658 --> 00:32:26,624
Ellen, I can't.

761
00:32:26,625 --> 00:32:28,358
It is not a problem.

762
00:32:28,359 --> 00:32:31,358
Truly. I'll write you a check.

763
00:32:35,094 --> 00:32:36,994
Thank you.

764
00:32:38,729 --> 00:32:40,162
Are you gonna stay

765
00:32:40,163 --> 00:32:41,163
here?

766
00:32:41,164 --> 00:32:43,630
I mean... just till I

767
00:32:43,698 --> 00:32:45,598
get on my feet.

768
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,067
Does Dad know?

769
00:32:49,068 --> 00:32:51,002
No.

770
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:52,238
And he's going to freak out.

771
00:32:52,239 --> 00:32:53,305
You know he's going to blame me.

772
00:32:53,306 --> 00:32:54,339
I just... I can't take that

773
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:55,340
right now, Ellen.

774
00:32:55,341 --> 00:32:56,507
I just don't... I don't want to

775
00:32:56,508 --> 00:32:58,142
be yelled at.

776
00:32:58,143 --> 00:32:59,944
I know, I know.

777
00:32:59,945 --> 00:33:01,645
But you're going to have to tell

778
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,047
him soon.

779
00:33:03,048 --> 00:33:04,882
I was going to in the

780
00:33:04,883 --> 00:33:08,820
morning.

781
00:33:08,887 --> 00:33:10,855
Can you, um... can you stay?

782
00:33:10,923 --> 00:33:12,256
I just really don't want to do

783
00:33:12,257 --> 00:33:13,824
this alone.

784
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:14,958
I really want to be

785
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:15,959
there for you.

786
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:16,959
I do. I...

787
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,361
But I have to work.

788
00:33:20,429 --> 00:33:22,096
I know, you know

789
00:33:22,097 --> 00:33:24,098
what, I totally understand.

790
00:33:24,165 --> 00:33:26,166
It's okay.

791
00:33:36,842 --> 00:33:37,875
Do you know how

792
00:33:37,876 --> 00:33:40,945
long the flight will be?

793
00:33:41,012 --> 00:33:43,381
Uh, we can ask when we

794
00:33:43,448 --> 00:33:47,217
get there, okay?

795
00:33:47,285 --> 00:33:48,886
You look like your

796
00:33:48,887 --> 00:33:50,320
dad right now.

797
00:33:50,321 --> 00:33:52,389
Stop talking, please.

798
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,361
How do I know you?

799
00:33:58,362 --> 00:34:03,198
Your voice sounds so familiar.

800
00:34:03,266 --> 00:34:06,069
Just rest, okay?

801
00:34:08,608 --> 00:34:09,609
So, what is it you

802
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:14,149
want to talk about, Tom?

803
00:34:14,217 --> 00:34:18,081
You two look tense.

804
00:34:18,148 --> 00:34:19,281
Look, uh, there's no

805
00:34:19,282 --> 00:34:21,548
good way to say this.

806
00:34:21,616 --> 00:34:23,249
But I want to tell you before

807
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:24,417
you got your next financial

808
00:34:24,418 --> 00:34:26,019
statements.

809
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:27,153
Financial statements?

810
00:34:27,154 --> 00:34:29,188
What's this about?

811
00:34:33,392 --> 00:34:37,261
I, uh, screwed up.

812
00:34:41,299 --> 00:34:42,466
Jesus, one day in

813
00:34:42,467 --> 00:34:43,867
this house and your crap's in

814
00:34:43,868 --> 00:34:45,135
every single room!

815
00:34:45,136 --> 00:34:46,402
You and Eddie want to be slobs,

816
00:34:46,403 --> 00:34:48,604
fine, do it in your house, not

817
00:34:48,672 --> 00:34:49,671
mine!

818
00:34:49,672 --> 00:34:50,472
Gary, I don't think

819
00:34:50,473 --> 00:34:52,040
she's a slob.

820
00:34:52,041 --> 00:34:53,341
I said I'm sorry.

821
00:34:53,342 --> 00:34:54,175
I didn't even put this stuff

822
00:34:54,176 --> 00:34:55,209
here, Mom did.

823
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:55,977
Oh, don't you blame

824
00:34:55,978 --> 00:34:56,710
your mother!

825
00:34:56,711 --> 00:34:58,545
Dad, stop it.

826
00:34:58,546 --> 00:35:02,282
I think she gets it.

827
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,149
Are you ready to

828
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,083
leave, honey?

829
00:35:04,084 --> 00:35:05,418
We can take you to the train.

830
00:35:05,419 --> 00:35:07,086
No, Ma, I think I'm

831
00:35:07,087 --> 00:35:08,821
gonna stay the night.

832
00:35:08,822 --> 00:35:10,688
Oh, well, how

833
00:35:10,689 --> 00:35:11,923
wonderful.

834
00:35:11,924 --> 00:35:13,123
Our two girls under the same

835
00:35:13,124 --> 00:35:14,124
roof.

836
00:35:14,125 --> 00:35:15,058
Fine with me.

837
00:35:15,059 --> 00:35:17,159
One less trip to the station.

838
00:35:17,227 --> 00:35:20,095
Gary, honey...

839
00:35:20,162 --> 00:35:22,563
It's gonna be okay.

840
00:35:27,835 --> 00:35:28,835
How far away are

841
00:35:28,836 --> 00:35:29,635
you?

842
00:35:29,636 --> 00:35:30,502
I'm ten minutes from the

843
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:32,738
airport.

844
00:35:41,314 --> 00:35:43,148
We found her.

845
00:35:43,149 --> 00:35:44,550
She's on the way to the airport.

846
00:35:44,551 --> 00:35:46,051
We have a license plate number.

847
00:35:46,052 --> 00:35:47,018
I told you, Patty,

848
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:47,786
we're not gonna detain her

849
00:35:47,787 --> 00:35:48,687
without cause.

850
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:50,556
We have cause.

851
00:35:50,557 --> 00:35:52,125
What is it?

852
00:35:52,126 --> 00:35:52,959
He's driving with a

853
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,960
broken taillight.

854
00:36:02,835 --> 00:36:05,703
Shit.

855
00:36:19,045 --> 00:36:22,682
Shit.

856
00:36:22,683 --> 00:36:23,750
How are you?

857
00:36:23,751 --> 00:36:25,152
License and registration.

858
00:36:25,153 --> 00:36:26,387
Is there a problem?

859
00:36:26,388 --> 00:36:28,690
Your taillight's busted.

860
00:36:28,758 --> 00:36:31,227
Oh, I'm sorry.

861
00:36:37,667 --> 00:36:39,067
What's wrong with her?

862
00:36:39,068 --> 00:36:40,201
She's, uh, she's ill.

863
00:36:40,202 --> 00:36:41,235
I was actually just taking her

864
00:36:41,236 --> 00:36:42,737
to the hospital.

865
00:36:42,738 --> 00:36:43,671
Really?

866
00:36:43,672 --> 00:36:45,304
'Cause the hospital's a mile

867
00:36:45,305 --> 00:36:46,272
back.

868
00:36:46,273 --> 00:36:47,640
You just passed it.

869
00:36:47,641 --> 00:36:48,474
Oh, really?

870
00:36:48,475 --> 00:36:51,109
Um...

871
00:36:51,177 --> 00:36:53,445
1-2-Alpha to HQ.

872
00:36:53,513 --> 00:36:56,613
I need rescue.

873
00:36:59,183 --> 00:36:59,849
(woman talking indistinctly

874
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:01,851
over P.A.)

875
00:37:09,591 --> 00:37:13,393
She's not coming.

876
00:37:13,461 --> 00:37:15,195
I thought I'd get here to stop

877
00:37:15,196 --> 00:37:16,463
her myself, but it turns out I

878
00:37:16,464 --> 00:37:19,033
didn't have to.

879
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,934
The police pulled her over.

880
00:37:20,935 --> 00:37:22,969
Actually, they pulled Joe Tobin

881
00:37:23,037 --> 00:37:24,670
over.

882
00:37:24,671 --> 00:37:25,971
Danielle Marchetti was

883
00:37:25,972 --> 00:37:29,976
unconscious in the backseat.

884
00:37:30,043 --> 00:37:31,044
Gee, that all

885
00:37:31,045 --> 00:37:34,279
sounds terrific, but I have no

886
00:37:34,347 --> 00:37:36,580
idea what you're talking about.

887
00:37:36,648 --> 00:37:38,681
It took me a while

888
00:37:38,749 --> 00:37:40,016
to find the airport she was

889
00:37:40,017 --> 00:37:42,117
flying out of, but I figured it

890
00:37:42,185 --> 00:37:44,052
out.

891
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:45,319
And surprise, surprise, I find

892
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,454
you here.

893
00:37:47,521 --> 00:37:48,454
Yeah, I'm off for

894
00:37:48,455 --> 00:37:51,824
a weekend in the Bahamas.

895
00:37:51,892 --> 00:37:55,326
Care to join?

896
00:37:55,393 --> 00:37:56,460
Danielle's in the

897
00:37:56,461 --> 00:37:57,928
hospital, in case you're

898
00:37:57,929 --> 00:38:00,730
wondering.

899
00:38:00,797 --> 00:38:03,465
What happened, Mr. Winstone?

900
00:38:03,533 --> 00:38:07,001
Joe told the police she fell?

901
00:38:07,069 --> 00:38:07,902
Patty, listen,

902
00:38:07,903 --> 00:38:08,736
before you issue the press

903
00:38:08,737 --> 00:38:09,570
release...

904
00:38:09,571 --> 00:38:10,405
There's no press

905
00:38:10,406 --> 00:38:11,239
release.

906
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,507
There never was.

907
00:38:12,508 --> 00:38:14,877
Oh, I see.

908
00:38:14,945 --> 00:38:18,184
You had me followed.

909
00:38:18,252 --> 00:38:19,252
That's how you found the

910
00:38:19,253 --> 00:38:23,090
airport.

911
00:38:23,158 --> 00:38:24,724
I'm impressed.

912
00:38:24,725 --> 00:38:26,192
Tonight's been

913
00:38:26,193 --> 00:38:28,227
educational.

914
00:38:28,295 --> 00:38:29,695
I always knew the Tobins were

915
00:38:29,696 --> 00:38:31,563
hiding something.

916
00:38:31,564 --> 00:38:33,131
Now I know you're helping them

917
00:38:33,132 --> 00:38:36,501
do it.

918
00:38:36,569 --> 00:38:37,469
My colleague's already served

919
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:39,270
Danielle with a subpoena.

920
00:38:39,271 --> 00:38:42,574
So, I got what I wanted.

921
00:38:42,642 --> 00:38:46,312
Good night, Mr. Winstone.

922
00:39:01,329 --> 00:39:05,500
Here's a check.

923
00:39:05,567 --> 00:39:07,835
Thanks, Ellie.

924
00:39:07,903 --> 00:39:09,203
There's a T-shirt and stuff

925
00:39:09,204 --> 00:39:10,238
upstairs if you want to borrow

926
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:12,407
it.

927
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:50,711
Find everything you need?

928
00:39:50,779 --> 00:39:52,780
Yeah.

929
00:39:54,216 --> 00:39:55,516
GARY Remember

930
00:39:55,517 --> 00:39:58,686
this?

931
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:05,860
I do.

932
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:07,161
Look at you two.

933
00:40:07,162 --> 00:40:09,166
Were we not adorable?

934
00:40:27,989 --> 00:40:31,025
I'll be right back.

935
00:40:41,829 --> 00:40:44,697
Hey, Patty, it's Ellen.

936
00:40:44,765 --> 00:40:46,765
I was just, uh, wondering-

937
00:40:46,833 --> 00:40:48,833
did you find that witness?

938
00:40:48,834 --> 00:40:54,206
