1
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,357
One.

2
00:01:19,392 --> 00:01:20,766
...between the eyes!

3
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,840
Two.

4
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,887
...between the eyes.

5
00:01:52,672 --> 00:01:54,396
- Out!
- What?

6
00:01:57,664 --> 00:01:59,519
- She was safe.
- She was out.

7
00:01:59,553 --> 00:02:01,408
She landed right there.
She's safe.

8
00:02:03,937 --> 00:02:05,530
Turk: Aw, come on.

9
00:02:05,569 --> 00:02:08,122
Umpire: That's enough.
I don't want to hear another word.

10
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:10,333
- You're gone!
- Yeah, I'm gone.

11
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:20,439
My grandmother used to take me
to Washington Square Park...

12
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:24,577
...to watch Bobby Fischer
play 10 games at the same time.

13
00:02:24,609 --> 00:02:26,584
Queen me.

14
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:29,440
He was five-six moves ahead
on each table.

15
00:02:30,401 --> 00:02:32,790
Anyway, he became
the world champ, didn't he?

16
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:34,775
Then he lost his fucking mind.

17
00:02:37,954 --> 00:02:40,507
He became a raving paranoid.

18
00:02:40,546 --> 00:02:42,204
Being attacked
from all directions...

19
00:02:42,242 --> 00:02:44,184
...he couldn't see
what was in front of him.

20
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:53,115
Mate. Mate!

21
00:03:22,242 --> 00:03:24,664
My name is David Fisk...

22
00:03:24,707 --> 00:03:26,779
Detective First Grade.

23
00:03:27,939 --> 00:03:30,689
I've been a cop in the NYPD
for over 30 years.

24
00:03:31,971 --> 00:03:34,207
In that time...

25
00:03:35,747 --> 00:03:38,114
I've killed 14 people.

26
00:03:39,939 --> 00:03:41,848
Man: Run that by me
one more time.

27
00:03:42,819 --> 00:03:45,274
I've killed 14 people.

28
00:03:45,315 --> 00:03:46,908
He's nuts.

29
00:03:49,283 --> 00:03:51,422
Turk's voice: When did
these things start?

30
00:03:55,363 --> 00:03:57,436
How did they start?

31
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:05,471
Maybe this one started
with a guy named Charles Randall.

32
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:13,666
Randall was a child killer.

33
00:04:15,364 --> 00:04:17,633
He killed his girlfriend's daughter.

34
00:04:17,668 --> 00:04:20,003
...about four years ago.

35
00:04:21,284 --> 00:04:23,226
Randall: Fuck you, damn asshole.

36
00:04:24,452 --> 00:04:26,012
Turk's voice: He was tried
for the crime...

37
00:04:26,052 --> 00:04:28,419
...but was acquitted
by a jury of his peers.

38
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:45,340
My partner and I
found this unacceptable.

39
00:04:48,964 --> 00:04:51,812
My partner is a good man.

40
00:05:11,973 --> 00:05:14,461
Are you really
gonna do this thing?

41
00:05:14,501 --> 00:05:16,443
Do what?

42
00:05:16,485 --> 00:05:18,819
You're going to
take down Randall.

43
00:05:18,854 --> 00:05:20,926
...for a homicide
he didn't commit.

44
00:05:25,605 --> 00:05:27,842
What am I gonna do?

45
00:05:27,877 --> 00:05:29,787
You're my partner.

46
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:32,131
- You're my role model.
- Right.

47
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:34,075
What am I gonna do
without a role model?

48
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:40,033
We didn't have
this conversation.

49
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:42,459
What conversation?

50
00:06:00,806 --> 00:06:02,497
Turk's voice: It got done.

51
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:09,533
Randall lost his freedom.

52
00:06:09,574 --> 00:06:11,462
...for the crime he didn't commit.

53
00:06:17,094 --> 00:06:19,069
Turk's voice: I lost my faith.

54
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:24,060
- I'm gonna go.
- Okay.

55
00:06:33,575 --> 00:06:35,078
You can take this
as a confession if you want.

56
00:06:35,111 --> 00:06:36,582
You can take this
as a confession if you want.

57
00:06:36,615 --> 00:06:38,525
Whatever.

58
00:06:38,567 --> 00:06:41,250
A few weeks ago
things heated up.

59
00:06:41,287 --> 00:06:42,978
What do we got on him, Turk?

60
00:06:43,015 --> 00:06:47,238
Marcus Smith, AKA Spider...
big big dope deals...

61
00:06:47,271 --> 00:06:49,606
...murders, extortion,
lots of nice things.

62
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:51,876
He converted
this old abandoned bank.

63
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,951
...into Club 404 of Harlem.

64
00:06:53,992 --> 00:06:55,552
Maybe when he sees us
he'll confess.

65
00:06:55,591 --> 00:06:57,479
What, you don't believe
in miracles?

66
00:06:57,511 --> 00:06:59,038
When you pick up a check
one day...

67
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:01,316
...one day,
then I'll believe in miracles.

68
00:07:01,351 --> 00:07:04,351
- Let's go. I'm buying.
- Yeah, that's a miracle I want to see.

69
00:07:08,263 --> 00:07:10,751
We fly high, no lie.

70
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:13,639
You hear that?
You know this, balling.

71
00:07:13,671 --> 00:07:16,519
Foreign rides outside.

72
00:07:16,552 --> 00:07:18,526
It's like showbiz,
we in the building.

73
00:07:18,567 --> 00:07:20,673
We stay fly, no lie...

74
00:07:20,712 --> 00:07:22,403
Turk: This is where he launders
his money.

75
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:26,237
Rooster: Oh, yeah,
cleaning green green green.

76
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,385
Turk: He's all business.

77
00:07:29,736 --> 00:07:31,492
I gotta take a leak.

78
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,912
Oh, I'll just be a sec.

79
00:07:42,953 --> 00:07:44,360
I'm not peeking.

80
00:07:44,392 --> 00:07:46,694
No problem.

81
00:07:51,048 --> 00:07:53,470
- You guys are so lucky.
- Why is that?

82
00:07:53,513 --> 00:07:55,717
No line to the bathroom and...

83
00:07:57,576 --> 00:07:59,715
You get to pee standing up.

84
00:07:59,753 --> 00:08:01,509
Unzip, psss, zip.

85
00:08:01,545 --> 00:08:03,716
Badda boom badda bing,
you're out of here.

86
00:08:03,753 --> 00:08:07,976
Yeah, the big guy really outdid himself
on this thing.

87
00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:09,318
You want a bump?

88
00:08:09,353 --> 00:08:11,208
Where did you get that from?

89
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:13,575
Spider. Supremo.

90
00:09:19,211 --> 00:09:21,120
Not bad.

91
00:09:21,162 --> 00:09:24,294
Turk: Not bad?
What the fuck were you looking for?

92
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,632
Come on, Turk...

93
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:28,576
...you pulled my hair.

94
00:09:28,618 --> 00:09:31,684
Gee, my little sister used to
pull my hair harder than that.

95
00:09:31,723 --> 00:09:32,868
Whatever.

96
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:38,882
I gotta go.

97
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,783
- Where the fuck are you going?
- I'm tired.

98
00:09:51,819 --> 00:09:54,372
You're tired?
It's America, you whiny bitch.

99
00:09:54,411 --> 00:09:57,128
Why don't you fucking get in the cab
and do some honest work?

100
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:59,912
Yeah, she's on her way.
She can't wait to see you.

101
00:09:59,947 --> 00:10:03,078
Rambo the Skateboard Pimp
was my 10th kill.

102
00:10:05,132 --> 00:10:08,677
Think of me as a street-sweeper.

103
00:10:08,716 --> 00:10:10,723
I cleaned up this worthless
piece of shit.

104
00:10:10,763 --> 00:10:13,665
...and left an obituary of sorts.
It rhymes.

105
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:24,457
Rooster, we gotta find out
who did this.

106
00:10:24,492 --> 00:10:26,281
Give him a medal.

107
00:10:26,316 --> 00:10:29,033
Hey, Rambo, you see
who did this?

108
00:10:29,068 --> 00:10:30,955
He ain't talking, eh?

109
00:10:30,988 --> 00:10:33,093
Real name Robert Brady.

110
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,042
Bobby Brady. Damn shame.

111
00:10:35,084 --> 00:10:36,840
What are you thinking?
Marcia? Greg?

112
00:10:38,285 --> 00:10:40,194
You guys messing up
my crime scene again?

113
00:10:40,236 --> 00:10:42,276
You don't know
who Bobby Brady is?

114
00:10:42,316 --> 00:10:44,226
Yeah, we met about an hour ago.

115
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:46,919
- It looks like close range.
- From the stippling around the wound.

116
00:10:46,956 --> 00:10:48,517
I'd say two to three feet away.

117
00:10:48,556 --> 00:10:51,174
We'll be fishing fragments
out of his brains.

118
00:10:51,213 --> 00:10:53,187
- What?
- No, I just got that...

119
00:10:53,229 --> 00:10:55,236
"Marcia? Greg?"
That's a good one, Rooster.

120
00:10:55,276 --> 00:10:56,934
Well, that was quick.

121
00:10:56,973 --> 00:10:58,729
Just trying to keep pace with you.

122
00:11:02,733 --> 00:11:05,733
Turk: "He trades in sin,
distributes flesh.

123
00:11:05,773 --> 00:11:08,042
He picks the fruit
when it is fresh.

124
00:11:08,077 --> 00:11:11,077
Now someone else
must slap his whore.

125
00:11:11,117 --> 00:11:15,656
His heart has stopped.
He breathes no more. "

126
00:11:17,453 --> 00:11:19,395
What do you want to do
about this?

127
00:11:19,437 --> 00:11:22,120
I say let's make the best of it...

128
00:11:22,157 --> 00:11:25,157
...canvass the hookers.
Maybe we'll meet one you like.

129
00:11:25,197 --> 00:11:28,677
Please. I got all I can handle
from you-know-who.

130
00:11:28,718 --> 00:11:30,441
No shit?

131
00:11:30,478 --> 00:11:33,445
She's got my sperm level so low
I gotta sit down to take a piss.

132
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:35,078
Oh, thanks for that picture.

133
00:11:35,118 --> 00:11:37,289
Hey, what can I tell you?

134
00:11:37,325 --> 00:11:39,976
How can I help you, gentlemen?

135
00:11:40,014 --> 00:11:41,956
We'd like to talk to you
about your boss.

136
00:11:41,998 --> 00:11:44,169
He's upstairs.

137
00:11:44,206 --> 00:11:46,442
No, your other boss.

138
00:11:50,093 --> 00:11:52,003
Rambo.

139
00:11:52,046 --> 00:11:53,901
He is asshole.

140
00:11:53,933 --> 00:11:56,967
Why "he is asshole"?

141
00:11:57,006 --> 00:11:59,308
Follow me, please.

142
00:12:03,886 --> 00:12:05,446
You know anybody
who'd want to kill him?

143
00:12:05,486 --> 00:12:07,079
Me.

144
00:12:07,119 --> 00:12:08,363
Anyone else?

145
00:12:08,398 --> 00:12:10,308
Why? He's dead?

146
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:14,404
Hey, listen, you want to smarten up
and help us out.

147
00:12:14,446 --> 00:12:16,071
...or am I gonna have to call
somebody at ICE

148
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:17,802
...and have you on the next plane
to kielbasa-land?

149
00:12:17,838 --> 00:12:19,594
Go ahead.

150
00:12:19,631 --> 00:12:21,453
I am American citizen.

151
00:12:21,486 --> 00:12:23,461
Yeah.

152
00:12:23,502 --> 00:12:25,477
Lick my balls anytime.

153
00:12:25,518 --> 00:12:27,045
What?

154
00:12:27,086 --> 00:12:28,996
Call us anytime, you know...

155
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:31,341
...if you hear something, anything.

156
00:12:33,615 --> 00:12:36,332
Rooster: I think we're looking
for a guy named Sam the Butcher.

157
00:12:36,367 --> 00:12:38,734
Who?

158
00:12:38,767 --> 00:12:40,938
Nah, he's kidding around.
But seriously, Lieutenant...

159
00:12:40,974 --> 00:12:42,917
...how far do you want us to go
with this Rambo murder?

160
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,326
I don't know, I was thinking maybe
you could investigate it a bit more...

161
00:12:45,359 --> 00:12:47,661
...figure out who did it,
try to put him in jail.

162
00:12:47,695 --> 00:12:50,444
That is, if it doesn't get in the way
of your shuffleboard lessons.

163
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:51,940
Yeah, no problem.

164
00:12:51,984 --> 00:12:54,733
We're also working this dealer Spider
who's tied to these two stiffs.

165
00:12:54,767 --> 00:12:56,011
we found on Fresh Kills.

166
00:12:59,183 --> 00:13:01,965
If we can nail him, who knows
how far up the ladder it will lead?

167
00:13:01,999 --> 00:13:03,079
So what about it?

168
00:13:03,119 --> 00:13:04,745
I popped this lawyer
with an ounce of blow.

169
00:13:04,783 --> 00:13:07,052
She practically shoved it up my nose.
I got her to flip on him.

170
00:13:07,088 --> 00:13:08,681
Lucky fuck, eh?

171
00:13:08,719 --> 00:13:10,280
She scored it from him directly?

172
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,524
- Yeah, she did.
- Good.

173
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:16,105
Okay, well, get what you can out of her
and kick her loose.

174
00:13:16,143 --> 00:13:18,480
I hate trying to prosecute
fucking lawyers.

175
00:13:26,864 --> 00:13:29,002
- This isn't Spider's club.
- The back way in.

176
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,902
Rooster: Yeah, it's an abandoned
linen factory, Jessica.

177
00:13:32,944 --> 00:13:35,759
I guess I'm not your average...

178
00:13:35,793 --> 00:13:37,222
what do you call it?

179
00:13:37,264 --> 00:13:39,173
- Rat?
- Stoolie?

180
00:13:39,216 --> 00:13:41,126
Thanks.

181
00:13:41,168 --> 00:13:44,714
I mean, I think usually
it's some poor African-American kid.

182
00:13:44,752 --> 00:13:46,891
...or a junkie or a prostitute.

183
00:13:46,928 --> 00:13:49,383
Well, normally 200-grand-a-year
corporate lawyers.

184
00:13:49,425 --> 00:13:52,240
...are much smarter than your average
African-American junkie whore...

185
00:13:52,272 --> 00:13:54,793
...normally, but sometimes
they only think they are.

186
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:57,582
Man over radio: It's all set
on this end.

187
00:13:57,617 --> 00:13:59,210
Are you guys sure
it's safe in there?

188
00:13:59,248 --> 00:14:02,183
Man: You tell your girlfriend
to grow a pair and let's go.

189
00:14:02,224 --> 00:14:05,159
What do you say, Counsel?
Are you ready to do this thing?

190
00:14:05,201 --> 00:14:07,754
Yeah, let's get it over with.

191
00:14:07,793 --> 00:14:10,640
Okay, remember what we said?
You go in there...

192
00:14:10,673 --> 00:14:13,934
...you wait for him to ask you
for what you need, right?

193
00:14:13,969 --> 00:14:16,489
And then you don't come back here
with less than four ounces.

194
00:14:16,529 --> 00:14:17,936
- Four ounces?
- Yeah.

195
00:14:17,969 --> 00:14:20,522
Isn't that a lot? I, like, buy a couple
of balls at the club, that's it.

196
00:14:20,562 --> 00:14:23,409
You just say you're going skiing and
you need a week's worth of fresh powder.

197
00:14:23,442 --> 00:14:25,678
Yeah, you tell him you're going
on vacation.

198
00:14:28,465 --> 00:14:32,043
I do this thing
and my record's wiped clean?

199
00:14:32,082 --> 00:14:33,326
As a whistle.

200
00:14:33,361 --> 00:14:35,249
No one at my law firm will know
that I got busted, right?

201
00:14:35,281 --> 00:14:36,743
It never happened.

202
00:14:37,809 --> 00:14:40,013
Look, Counsel, we all know you
better than this.

203
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:42,538
You just do this, you stop
shoving that shit up your nose...

204
00:14:42,578 --> 00:14:44,269
...you go home, you get married,
you have kids...

205
00:14:44,306 --> 00:14:46,859
...you never come back here,
and that's that.

206
00:14:48,305 --> 00:14:50,542
Yeah.

207
00:14:50,577 --> 00:14:53,294
Officer: Everybody's in position.

208
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:55,697
- Turk: Okay, we're going.
- Officer: Yes, sir.

209
00:14:57,906 --> 00:15:00,459
Officer: Let's push the signal
back 500/0.

210
00:15:01,426 --> 00:15:03,368
Rooster: Hey, Jessica.

211
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:04,817
Break a leg.

212
00:15:07,442 --> 00:15:09,352
It's two flights down.

213
00:15:09,394 --> 00:15:11,663
The door's on the left.
Ring the bell.

214
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,785
Hey, Stubby, why don't you
go and escort our company up here?

215
00:15:22,514 --> 00:15:24,456
Go on, fat boy.

216
00:15:28,178 --> 00:15:29,640
Get it on.

217
00:15:36,947 --> 00:15:39,533
- Good afternoon.
- Hey, Spider.

218
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:41,960
- I'll be downstairs.
- All right.

219
00:15:42,003 --> 00:15:43,945
- How are you?
- All right, baby...

220
00:15:43,987 --> 00:15:46,256
...just checking out this wizard shit
before I let my kids watch it.

221
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:48,658
- You seen this?
- No.

222
00:15:48,691 --> 00:15:51,058
The guy is a stone dealer.
I let my little ones watch this...

223
00:15:51,091 --> 00:15:53,263
...they'll all turn out junkies.
You know what I'm saying?

224
00:15:53,299 --> 00:15:54,728
He's got a point.

225
00:15:54,771 --> 00:15:56,876
- You remember Underdog?
- What about him?

226
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:59,731
That fucking dog spawned
a generation of junkies.

227
00:15:59,763 --> 00:16:03,440
So you converted the bank
into a club and a recording studio?

228
00:16:03,476 --> 00:16:05,931
- Yeah. You like it?
- Yeah.

229
00:16:05,971 --> 00:16:07,793
What are you talking about?

230
00:16:07,828 --> 00:16:09,486
What did Underdog do
all the time?

231
00:16:09,524 --> 00:16:11,149
He was always shining shoes.

232
00:16:11,187 --> 00:16:13,260
...and whenever Sweet Polly Purebred
would call out to him...

233
00:16:13,299 --> 00:16:15,187
...his dog ears would pick it up
and he'd rescue her.

234
00:16:15,219 --> 00:16:17,586
Yeah, but what did he do
when he needed his super strength?

235
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,692
He'd go to his ring, remember?

236
00:16:19,732 --> 00:16:21,520
Pull out a pill, pop it.

237
00:16:21,556 --> 00:16:24,905
Holy shit, you're right.
He was a little fucking speed freak.

238
00:16:24,948 --> 00:16:26,225
Spider: So what's the business?

239
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:28,977
How about a QP?
You're good for a QP.

240
00:16:29,012 --> 00:16:30,605
The fuck you want with QP?

241
00:16:30,644 --> 00:16:33,164
I'm going skiing with friends...

242
00:16:33,204 --> 00:16:35,659
...a lot of friends.

243
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,035
- Where?
- Aspen, Colorado.

244
00:16:38,068 --> 00:16:40,686
Shit. I'm sure you can
score one in Aspen.

245
00:16:40,725 --> 00:16:42,634
Not your primo brand.

246
00:16:43,605 --> 00:16:44,979
You ski?

247
00:16:45,013 --> 00:16:46,442
Sure. My whole life.

248
00:16:46,485 --> 00:16:49,485
Come on, I don't have all day.

249
00:16:49,524 --> 00:16:51,761
Why don't you put down your jacket,
stay a little while?

250
00:16:51,796 --> 00:16:52,941
What do you think?

251
00:16:52,981 --> 00:16:54,475
Jessica: Actually,
I've got to run.

252
00:16:54,517 --> 00:16:58,259
I have a major IPO
closing in an hour, so...

253
00:16:58,293 --> 00:17:00,911
You know, stress will kill you.
You gotta chill out.

254
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:04,084
I'm as chill as I get.

255
00:17:04,117 --> 00:17:06,027
What do you want to do?

256
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:11,538
You know, every once in a while...

257
00:17:13,621 --> 00:17:15,595
...one of you Upper East Side bitches
gets popped...

258
00:17:15,637 --> 00:17:17,547
...tries to to roll over
on a nigga like me.

259
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:19,596
You're scared now.

260
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:26,572
Looks like the cavalry
come to rescue you.

261
00:17:26,613 --> 00:17:28,042
Can I help you, gentlemen?

262
00:17:28,085 --> 00:17:29,459
Yeah, let us in, Spider.

263
00:17:29,493 --> 00:17:31,598
I'm sorry, there's no one here
by that name.

264
00:17:31,637 --> 00:17:34,420
- Let us in.
- We only want to talk to you.

265
00:17:37,013 --> 00:17:39,795
See, I know how to look
and I know where to look.

266
00:17:45,494 --> 00:17:47,381
Come to papa.

267
00:17:49,014 --> 00:17:50,607
It always hurts the first time.

268
00:17:51,894 --> 00:17:53,138
Turk: You all right?

269
00:17:53,174 --> 00:17:54,898
Why wouldn't she be all right?
We're watching TV.

270
00:17:54,934 --> 00:17:56,527
How the fuck is she gonna get hurt
watching TV?

271
00:17:56,566 --> 00:17:59,054
She could have seen or heard
something that scared her.

272
00:17:59,093 --> 00:18:00,916
- Like what?
- Like some big fucking mutt.

273
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:02,412
...shooting his bug fat
fucking mouth off.

274
00:18:02,454 --> 00:18:05,204
Wasn't nobody here fitting that description
till a minute ago.

275
00:18:05,238 --> 00:18:07,060
I'm gonna show you ugly,
you fucking mother...

276
00:18:07,094 --> 00:18:09,461
- We've said enough.
- Oh, you finna bring your wife up in here?

277
00:18:09,495 --> 00:18:12,429
That's it. That's it.
Let's go. It's okay.

278
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:15,089
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay.

279
00:18:15,126 --> 00:18:17,014
You want your wire back?

280
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:20,339
Firearm!

281
00:18:20,374 --> 00:18:21,421
No, Stubby, no!

282
00:18:29,847 --> 00:18:31,603
Get down.
Get the fuck down!

283
00:18:40,982 --> 00:18:42,389
Turk: Come on.

284
00:18:42,423 --> 00:18:45,106
The fat one's dead.

285
00:18:53,847 --> 00:18:55,189
Well, that went well.

286
00:18:56,983 --> 00:18:58,806
Oh, shit, you're bleeding.

287
00:18:59,768 --> 00:19:02,735
3-4 squad, Central.
11-41, request ambulance.

288
00:19:02,775 --> 00:19:05,459
I need EMS. Subject shot,
184th and St. Nicholas.

289
00:19:05,495 --> 00:19:07,600
Really, I tried my best.

290
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,804
You're doing just fine, Counsel.
You're doing just fine. Just relax.

291
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,807
Hey, guys, if you ever
need a lawyer...

292
00:19:13,848 --> 00:19:16,466
Yeah, okay.

293
00:19:16,503 --> 00:19:18,870
You bet.

294
00:19:21,496 --> 00:19:23,635
In good old days
we used to.

295
00:19:23,672 --> 00:19:26,290
...let the perp bleed out
and call off the ambulance.

296
00:19:26,328 --> 00:19:28,183
- Calm calm calm.
- Fucking lowlife.

297
00:19:28,216 --> 00:19:29,940
You made your point.
You made your point.

298
00:19:29,976 --> 00:19:32,180
Tough little bitch, ain't you,
kicking a man while he's handcuffed?

299
00:19:32,216 --> 00:19:34,605
Shut the fuck up,
you piece of shit.

300
00:19:34,648 --> 00:19:36,208
You think I won't blow
your fucking head off?

301
00:19:36,248 --> 00:19:37,939
I wouldn't think twice
about it.

302
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:40,147
I'd go in there,
get the fat boy's gun...

303
00:19:40,184 --> 00:19:43,697
...come back here
and put two between your eyes.

304
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:50,222
Where's EMS?

305
00:19:50,264 --> 00:19:53,330
Woman: This thing was a clusterfuck
to end all clusterfucks.

306
00:19:53,369 --> 00:19:54,863
You got nothing.

307
00:19:54,904 --> 00:19:56,792
How about felony murder?

308
00:19:56,824 --> 00:19:59,213
No drugs, right?
So no predicate felony...

309
00:19:59,256 --> 00:20:01,079
...no conspiracy,
no nothing.

310
00:20:01,113 --> 00:20:03,055
No felony. No felony.
I can't believe this.

311
00:20:03,096 --> 00:20:04,755
No felony.
How do you spell felony?

312
00:20:04,793 --> 00:20:07,990
Homicide, racketeering, drugs...
I mean, what are we talking about?

313
00:20:08,025 --> 00:20:10,545
Hey, you're lucky
that white girl didn't die.

314
00:20:10,585 --> 00:20:12,407
IAB is gonna interview
both of you.

315
00:20:12,441 --> 00:20:14,807
...and do a preliminary report
over the next couple of weeks.

316
00:20:14,841 --> 00:20:18,190
Now off the record
you actually didn't violate procedure.

317
00:20:18,233 --> 00:20:20,568
...because the victim had a firearm
aimed at you...

318
00:20:20,601 --> 00:20:22,740
...so if you stick together
you should make it through this.

319
00:20:22,777 --> 00:20:24,687
Lieutenant: You'd better get
your story straight too...

320
00:20:24,729 --> 00:20:27,446
'cause I'm not going back to Far Rockaway
because you two fucked up.

321
00:20:27,482 --> 00:20:29,969
And you're gonna spend some couch time
with the rubber-gun squad.

322
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:33,654
And you'd better take this shrink seriously
or you'll be off active duty.

323
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,380
That fucking piece of shit
just walks.

324
00:20:35,418 --> 00:20:37,141
Knock it off, Turk.

325
00:20:39,546 --> 00:20:42,066
Relax, partner.
He's gonna get his.

326
00:20:42,105 --> 00:20:44,527
Man: Gentlemen, your questions.

327
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:46,872
- Who made the decision to enter?
- I did.

328
00:20:46,905 --> 00:20:48,815
- Whose decision was it to enter?
- Mine.

329
00:20:48,858 --> 00:20:51,062
Did you immediately identify yourselves
as police officers?

330
00:20:51,097 --> 00:20:53,301
- Yes, we did.
- Did you immediately identify yourselves?

331
00:20:53,338 --> 00:20:55,727
The informant's position
was becoming untenable.

332
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:57,941
- We were afraid she was in danger.
- Turns out you were right.

333
00:20:57,978 --> 00:21:00,367
- No fucking kidding, nine-to-fiver.
- Excuse me, Detective?

334
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:02,712
Are you finished
with my client?

335
00:21:04,602 --> 00:21:08,399
- They're like Lennon and McCartney.
- Not an inch of daylight between them.

336
00:21:08,442 --> 00:21:09,620
What do you think?

337
00:21:09,658 --> 00:21:10,902
Nothing there.

338
00:21:10,939 --> 00:21:13,688
They endangered the informant.
We can't make them wrong on that.

339
00:21:13,723 --> 00:21:15,283
They saw a gun, they reacted.

340
00:21:15,322 --> 00:21:17,013
They beat the fuck
out of the suspect...

341
00:21:17,051 --> 00:21:19,058
...but he's not filing charges.

342
00:21:19,098 --> 00:21:21,073
Let's see what the shrink says.

343
00:21:22,043 --> 00:21:24,344
So what are we gonna
do now, Doc?

344
00:21:24,379 --> 00:21:26,484
Are we gonna find out
if I'm sane enough.

345
00:21:26,522 --> 00:21:29,141
...to carry a gun,
chase bad guys?

346
00:21:29,179 --> 00:21:31,667
Okay, why did you become a cop?

347
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:34,325
Well, it was New Year's Eve.
It seemed like a good idea at the time.

348
00:21:34,363 --> 00:21:38,105
I didn't have the same opportunities
you had, Dr. Prosky.

349
00:21:38,138 --> 00:21:40,724
Where I come from
it was either a gun and a badge.

350
00:21:40,762 --> 00:21:42,551
...or a hard hat and a hammer.

351
00:21:42,587 --> 00:21:44,954
How do you feel
when you fire your weapon?

352
00:21:44,987 --> 00:21:47,605
It's like Dirty Harry said...
"There's nothing wrong.

353
00:21:47,643 --> 00:21:50,163
with a little shooting as long as
the right people get shot. "

354
00:21:50,203 --> 00:21:52,058
Prosky: And when the wrong people
get shot?

355
00:21:52,091 --> 00:21:54,938
Turk: It sucks, but I'd rather be in it
that out of it.

356
00:21:54,971 --> 00:21:56,978
There's nothing worse
than being stuck on a bench.

357
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:59,158
How do you feel when you see
innocent people get killed?

358
00:21:59,196 --> 00:22:01,334
You know...

359
00:22:03,036 --> 00:22:06,102
I sort of get numb to it.

360
00:22:06,139 --> 00:22:08,692
Here.

361
00:22:08,732 --> 00:22:10,161
I want you to take this.

362
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:13,433
Use it to jot down your thoughts,
your questions...

363
00:22:13,467 --> 00:22:15,856
...anything you may have noticed
about yourself...

364
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,307
whatever.

365
00:22:17,339 --> 00:22:19,095
I won't ask for it.

366
00:22:19,132 --> 00:22:21,783
Just for you.

367
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,249
I want you to try it.

368
00:22:23,292 --> 00:22:25,234
Sounds like fun.

369
00:22:27,036 --> 00:22:30,451
Harder.

370
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:45,817
Go, Turk, go!

371
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:50,067
You got third.
Go go!

372
00:22:50,108 --> 00:22:52,694
Yeah!
Look at that.

373
00:22:52,732 --> 00:22:55,002
You own it. You own it.

374
00:22:55,036 --> 00:22:56,825
No matter what they say
about you...

375
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,868
...you're tremendous!

376
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:03,097
Go go, Turk, go!

377
00:23:04,861 --> 00:23:06,868
Safe.
You dropped the ball.

378
00:23:06,908 --> 00:23:09,145
- A fucking cheap shot, man.
- Get away from the bag.

379
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:11,995
- Or what? Or what? Or what?
- Watch the bag.

380
00:23:23,165 --> 00:23:25,500
Turk's voice: The NYPD is bubbling
with frustration...

381
00:23:25,533 --> 00:23:27,060
...hostility and testosterone...

382
00:23:27,101 --> 00:23:29,011
...ready to erupt
at any moment.

383
00:23:29,053 --> 00:23:30,995
Think of me
as the release valve.

384
00:23:31,037 --> 00:23:33,754
One flick of the trigger
and the pressure goes down.

385
00:23:33,789 --> 00:23:35,796
You know why
you join the force?

386
00:23:35,837 --> 00:23:37,845
To get respect.

387
00:23:37,885 --> 00:23:39,543
Most people respect the badge.

388
00:23:39,582 --> 00:23:41,818
Everybody respects the gun.

389
00:23:47,037 --> 00:23:48,947
Hey, Riley, I was talking to JD...

390
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:51,925
...you guys caught a stiff named
Phillip Trager, a gun-runner?

391
00:23:51,966 --> 00:23:54,105
Oh, yeah, a real piece of shit.

392
00:23:54,142 --> 00:23:55,997
- How did that go down?
- I don't know.

393
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:58,201
Somebody gave him a taste
of his own medicine, I guess...

394
00:23:58,238 --> 00:24:00,540
walked right into his apartment,
killed him with one of his own guns.

395
00:24:00,574 --> 00:24:02,745
Did the shooter leave a note
or anything?

396
00:24:02,782 --> 00:24:05,630
Yeah, actually,
the shooter left a poem.

397
00:24:08,606 --> 00:24:11,027
He did?
No shit.

398
00:24:11,071 --> 00:24:12,980
Yeah. Hey, Simon...

399
00:24:13,022 --> 00:24:16,318
...you remember that poem
from the Trager case?

400
00:24:18,239 --> 00:24:20,213
What are you doing, man?

401
00:24:20,255 --> 00:24:22,164
Turk's asking about it.

402
00:24:22,206 --> 00:24:24,573
What the hell are you doing?

403
00:24:24,607 --> 00:24:26,941
¿Qué mierda 'tas haciendo ahí, papá?

404
00:24:26,975 --> 00:24:28,829
No le digas mierda a eso loco.

405
00:24:28,862 --> 00:24:32,343
Riley: Cálmate. He wants to hear
about the poem.

406
00:24:32,383 --> 00:24:34,522
"Merchant of thieving class...

407
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:37,559
I slit his throat
and capped his ass.

408
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:39,006
I took his gun, I took his...

409
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,908
I took his life, I took his gun,
But too bad he's not the only one. "

410
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:43,925
That's how it goes,
something like that.

411
00:24:43,967 --> 00:24:46,171
It's not iambic pentameter,
but it rhymes.

412
00:24:46,207 --> 00:24:48,116
- Rooster.
- Yo.

413
00:24:49,087 --> 00:24:50,909
We're looking for the same guy.

414
00:24:50,943 --> 00:24:53,976
He knocked off a pimp named Rambo
a few weeks ago. When was yours?

415
00:24:54,015 --> 00:24:56,437
Last week. We're running ours with the ATF
because of the guns.

416
00:24:56,479 --> 00:24:59,414
We're back in business on the Rambo case.
Looks like the same guy knocked off.

417
00:24:59,455 --> 00:25:01,790
- A gun dealer on the three-three last week.
- No shit.

418
00:25:01,823 --> 00:25:04,671
- What do you mean? That's our case.
- That's our case. You're taking our case.

419
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:07,070
Seniority, guys.
Tag along, you'll learn something.

420
00:25:07,104 --> 00:25:09,176
Oh, tell me the guy's name
is Greg Brady.

421
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:11,103
Please. It is, isn't it?

422
00:25:11,136 --> 00:25:13,591
Oh, somebody's knocking off
the Brady Bunch.

423
00:25:13,631 --> 00:25:17,341
Gotta be the Partridge Family.

424
00:25:17,375 --> 00:25:20,310
Turk's voice: Trager,
a gun-runner bites the dust...

425
00:25:20,351 --> 00:25:22,326
...number 11.

426
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:34,012
Karen: The bullet matched the. 45
in Trager's apartment.

427
00:25:34,048 --> 00:25:36,415
That was no surprise.
So I ran it through ATF.

428
00:25:36,448 --> 00:25:39,350
It's one of a batch of six
that was stolen from a gun shop.

429
00:25:39,392 --> 00:25:41,596
- in Virginia last month.
- Yeah, probably by Trager.

430
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:44,218
That's what they think.
He matches the description they have.

431
00:25:44,256 --> 00:25:46,842
It still doesn't help us find the guy.
It just helps us tie him to the victims...

432
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,269
which he's already doing
with his little fucking poems.

433
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:52,247
Excuse me. Hello.

434
00:25:52,288 --> 00:25:55,387
Hey, Turk, don't forget
we got a court date later.

435
00:25:55,424 --> 00:25:58,458
So...

436
00:25:58,497 --> 00:26:01,977
I heard he kicked the shit
out of that dealer you guys took down.

437
00:26:02,017 --> 00:26:03,773
Spider.

438
00:26:03,808 --> 00:26:04,921
So?

439
00:26:06,529 --> 00:26:08,918
Did he?

440
00:26:11,649 --> 00:26:14,169
Yeah, he got him
down on the ground.

441
00:26:14,209 --> 00:26:16,511
The guy was handcuffed.

442
00:26:17,473 --> 00:26:20,440
And he just started
kicking him in the gut.

443
00:26:20,481 --> 00:26:22,782
And then.

444
00:26:22,817 --> 00:26:25,053
...he gets down on the guy's chest.

445
00:26:25,089 --> 00:26:28,285
...and he really starts smacking him.

446
00:26:28,321 --> 00:26:31,136
...hard in the face over and over.

447
00:26:31,169 --> 00:26:33,079
...and screaming at the top
of his lungs...

448
00:26:33,121 --> 00:26:35,292
"I'm gonna break
your fucking face...

449
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:37,632
...you little bitch!"

450
00:26:37,665 --> 00:26:39,902
Then his eyes really started
to fill up.

451
00:26:39,937 --> 00:26:41,847
I mean, they get dark...

452
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:43,962
...you know how he gets
the sort of rage in him.

453
00:26:45,058 --> 00:26:47,611
I thought he was gonna
kill this guy.

454
00:26:48,929 --> 00:26:51,296
Really?

455
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:56,191
You're a bad little girl.

456
00:26:56,226 --> 00:26:58,014
Hmm?

457
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:00,985
- I got work to do.
- You bet.

458
00:27:02,882 --> 00:27:06,144
Woman: Counselor,
my hands are tied here.

459
00:27:06,178 --> 00:27:08,088
Without a secure
chain of custody...

460
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:10,748
...any evidence obtained
after the initial search.

461
00:27:10,786 --> 00:27:13,153
- Must be excluded.
- You gotta be fucking kidding me.

462
00:27:13,186 --> 00:27:15,455
Therefore I am forced
to grant defense.

463
00:27:15,491 --> 00:27:17,694
...motion to dismiss
all charges.

464
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:19,835
...of rape and assault
against Mr. Van Luytens.

465
00:27:19,874 --> 00:27:21,784
- Your Honor.
- Judge: You think I want this guy.

466
00:27:21,826 --> 00:27:23,899
...going anywhere
near my daughter...

467
00:27:23,939 --> 00:27:26,011
...or anyone's daughter
for that matter?

468
00:27:26,051 --> 00:27:28,418
You messed up.
I am unleashing your client.

469
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:30,622
...unto the world.
I'm sure we'll all be.

470
00:27:30,659 --> 00:27:32,033
...back here again very soon.

471
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:34,936
Look at him.
Look at this motherfucker.

472
00:27:34,979 --> 00:27:38,427
Hey, it's gonna come back to you, mutt.
You're gonna get it.

473
00:27:38,467 --> 00:27:40,801
- When you walk outside watch your back.
- Easy, Turk.

474
00:27:40,835 --> 00:27:41,947
Order in my court.

475
00:27:41,987 --> 00:27:45,118
- Okay, mutt? You fucking mutt.
- Not here, not now.

476
00:27:45,155 --> 00:27:47,490
Not here, not now.
Will you get him out of here.

477
00:27:47,523 --> 00:27:49,978
...before somebody passes a sentence
on him you can't appeal?

478
00:27:50,019 --> 00:27:51,196
Order!

479
00:27:51,235 --> 00:27:54,235
- You know what I mean? Go go.
- Order, Detective.

480
00:27:54,275 --> 00:27:58,072
Turk's voice: Dr. Prosky suggested
that I free-associate.

481
00:27:58,115 --> 00:28:00,417
So here I go.

482
00:28:00,451 --> 00:28:02,972
You know what I think about
when I pull a trigger?

483
00:28:03,011 --> 00:28:05,826
I think about the Infield Fly Rule.

484
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:08,762
I love that fucking rule.
It assumes the worst in everybody.

485
00:28:08,804 --> 00:28:12,349
It says, "Sorry, batter, you're a schmuck
for popping up with runners on.

486
00:28:12,388 --> 00:28:14,690
And you, stupid-ass infielder,
you don't get to cheat.

487
00:28:14,723 --> 00:28:17,058
...and drop the ball just because
you caught a break. "

488
00:28:17,092 --> 00:28:18,685
My favorite part...
the batter's out.

489
00:28:18,723 --> 00:28:20,796
...but the runners advance
at their own risk.

490
00:28:20,835 --> 00:28:23,007
Well, isn't this
a pleasant surprise?

491
00:28:23,044 --> 00:28:25,051
Turk's voice: That's the way
life should be.

492
00:28:25,092 --> 00:28:27,001
You can be a motherfucker
at your own risk.

493
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:33,857
Or not.
Van Luytens... One less rapist.

494
00:28:33,892 --> 00:28:36,031
Who's gonna miss him?
Nobody.

495
00:28:36,068 --> 00:28:38,141
Number 12 and counting.

496
00:28:51,812 --> 00:28:53,634
Whoa whoa, hot coffee.

497
00:28:53,669 --> 00:28:55,294
- Good morning, Detective Riley.
- Hey, good morning.

498
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:57,220
- Door on your left.
- Any signs of forced entry?

499
00:28:57,253 --> 00:28:58,878
Doesn't look like it.
Detective Perez is in there.

500
00:28:58,917 --> 00:29:00,258
He's in there already?
All right.

501
00:29:00,293 --> 00:29:02,333
- Hey, how about those Mets last night?
- Yeah, how about 'em?

502
00:29:02,372 --> 00:29:04,347
Hey, Teddy, Teddy, come here,
check this out.

503
00:29:05,701 --> 00:29:07,970
Wow.

504
00:29:08,005 --> 00:29:09,183
Fuck.

505
00:29:09,221 --> 00:29:11,904
- Oh my God.
- That's big.

506
00:29:11,941 --> 00:29:13,850
And powerful.

507
00:29:13,893 --> 00:29:16,642
- What, a plasma screen?
- LCD.

508
00:29:16,677 --> 00:29:18,651
- That's plasma.
- No, it's got to be LCD.

509
00:29:18,693 --> 00:29:20,897
- Perez: It wouldn't be that big.
- Hey, guys, guys.

510
00:29:20,933 --> 00:29:24,228
He was shot at close range,
dropped right here.

511
00:29:24,261 --> 00:29:26,912
The pussy doesn't look like he put up
much of a fight, does he, Karen?

512
00:29:26,949 --> 00:29:28,924
Nothing to indicate that.

513
00:29:28,965 --> 00:29:32,348
...in terms of struggle.
No forced entry, cuts, bruises.

514
00:29:32,389 --> 00:29:35,488
Hey, nobody wants to hear
about your private life, Officer Corelli.

515
00:29:35,525 --> 00:29:38,624
That's detective to you,
Officer Needledick.

516
00:29:38,661 --> 00:29:40,516
- Ooh.
- Perez: Ouch.

517
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:42,786
- Looks like it's our guy again.
- Who did you get this time?

518
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:44,415
This is Jonathan Van Luytens.

519
00:29:44,454 --> 00:29:46,309
He owns a couple
of car dealerships.

520
00:29:46,341 --> 00:29:48,578
- Oh, shit.
- He was up on rape charges...

521
00:29:48,613 --> 00:29:50,719
...but they got tossed out
last week.

522
00:29:50,758 --> 00:29:52,667
Look at this.

523
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:56,638
"A man devoid of all respect,
Of beauty, charm or intellect...

524
00:29:56,678 --> 00:29:59,013
He took what women
would not give.

525
00:29:59,046 --> 00:30:00,901
He didn't have
the right to live. "

526
00:30:00,934 --> 00:30:03,203
That's our boy all right.

527
00:30:03,238 --> 00:30:06,272
Looks like he had a beef
with our old pal Jonny.

528
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:07,357
You know him?

529
00:30:07,398 --> 00:30:09,186
Both: Yeah.

530
00:30:09,222 --> 00:30:11,426
He's one slippery
son of a bitch, let me tell you.

531
00:30:11,462 --> 00:30:14,021
Turk: Yeah.

532
00:30:14,054 --> 00:30:17,054
Lieutenant: You guys know how much
fun it is to not catch a serial killer?

533
00:30:17,095 --> 00:30:18,753
You got a point here, Lieutenant?

534
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:20,481
The point is.

535
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:22,558
...you'd better both
think seriously.

536
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:24,606
...about whether or not
you want the lead on this case.

537
00:30:24,646 --> 00:30:26,239
You don't think
we're up to this?

538
00:30:27,206 --> 00:30:30,272
Come on, you got what...

539
00:30:30,311 --> 00:30:32,896
...about 110 years on the job
between the two of you?

540
00:30:32,935 --> 00:30:35,869
120.

541
00:30:35,911 --> 00:30:38,082
I'm telling you, you screw it up
badly enough...

542
00:30:38,118 --> 00:30:40,223
...they may try to fuck you
out of your pension.

543
00:30:40,263 --> 00:30:41,441
You want to risk that?

544
00:30:41,479 --> 00:30:43,235
- Yeah.
- Fuck, yeah.

545
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:48,027
406, Lieutenant. 406.

546
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:50,558
Okay, 406...
what does that mean?

547
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:52,060
Ted Williams.

548
00:30:52,103 --> 00:30:55,038
Ted Williams, the last day of the season,
is batting 400.

549
00:30:55,079 --> 00:30:58,047
Sox manager wants to bench him,
protect his average, right?

550
00:30:58,087 --> 00:30:59,810
Williams plays
both games anyway...

551
00:30:59,847 --> 00:31:01,734
...goes six for eight,
ends up at 406...

552
00:31:01,767 --> 00:31:03,392
...the last guy that ever hit
over 400.

553
00:31:03,431 --> 00:31:05,820
Okay, fine. It's all yours.

554
00:31:05,863 --> 00:31:08,765
Just don't go moaning to me
when some traffic cop.

555
00:31:08,807 --> 00:31:11,011
...pulls your serial killer over
for speeding.

556
00:31:11,048 --> 00:31:13,568
...and he grabs your
15 minutes of fame and you realize.

557
00:31:13,607 --> 00:31:16,641
...the asshole could have been
standing right there in front of you.

558
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:19,614
...and it would have taken you
1000 light years to nail him.

559
00:31:19,655 --> 00:31:21,314
Not for nothing, Lieutenant...

560
00:31:21,352 --> 00:31:24,287
...light years measures distance,
not time.

561
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,967
Well, thank you, Detective.
I'll make a note of that.

562
00:31:28,999 --> 00:31:31,716
Ellis Lynde, 2003.

563
00:31:31,752 --> 00:31:34,403
This guy had a history
of cruising gay bars...

564
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:37,124
...picking up twinkies,
beating the shit out of them.

565
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,942
Lynde was found shot dead
in his apartment.

566
00:31:39,976 --> 00:31:42,758
Whoever's doing this
gets up real close to the guys...

567
00:31:42,792 --> 00:31:45,345
...blows their brains out
without any trouble...

568
00:31:45,384 --> 00:31:46,813
...leaves no fingerprints.

569
00:31:46,856 --> 00:31:48,580
...and obviously
takes pride in his work.

570
00:31:48,616 --> 00:31:52,740
Okay, what could be
murder number two back from '04...

571
00:31:52,777 --> 00:31:54,151
...one Matthew Mitrella.

572
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,960
Turk's voice: I was shaking
the first couple of times.

573
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,717
I killed in cold blood.

574
00:32:03,753 --> 00:32:06,950
I kept thinking if I got caught
they'd kick me off the force.

575
00:32:06,985 --> 00:32:09,505
I wasn't worried about prison,
but losing the gun and the shield...

576
00:32:09,545 --> 00:32:10,722
...that scared me.

577
00:32:10,761 --> 00:32:13,150
I went into work the next day
expecting to feel different.

578
00:32:13,193 --> 00:32:16,160
I thought everybody would look at me
the way cops look at civilians.

579
00:32:16,201 --> 00:32:18,339
...and know which ones are dirty.

580
00:32:25,033 --> 00:32:27,269
But they didn't.
That's when I knew

581
00:32:27,306 --> 00:32:29,793
I could keep on
doing this forever.

582
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:36,585
Turk's voice: So next stop... Spider.

583
00:32:36,617 --> 00:32:38,527
If we shut down his business...

584
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:40,479
...maybe he'd be a rat.

585
00:32:40,521 --> 00:32:42,431
We got a lawyer.

586
00:32:42,473 --> 00:32:46,085
We needed her to testify
that she bought coke from him.

587
00:32:46,121 --> 00:32:48,577
She was a good lawyer.

588
00:32:48,618 --> 00:32:52,895
Me and my partner paid a visit
to Club 404 of Harlem.

589
00:32:52,938 --> 00:32:54,017
A word about him...

590
00:32:54,058 --> 00:32:57,025
Tom Cowen's been my partner
for almost 30 years.

591
00:32:57,066 --> 00:32:58,921
He's the best cop
I've ever seen.

592
00:33:00,746 --> 00:33:04,129
I'm always the one
following him through the door.

593
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:06,243
There's a bullet
that was meant for me.

594
00:33:06,282 --> 00:33:09,697
...that's lodged in his torso.

595
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:11,713
He was my role model.

596
00:33:11,754 --> 00:33:14,023
The day I stopped
trying to be Tom Cowen.

597
00:33:14,058 --> 00:33:16,425
was the greatest day
of my life.

598
00:33:29,707 --> 00:33:32,577
Hey, Rooster...

599
00:33:32,619 --> 00:33:35,521
I was going through the files
on poetry boy.

600
00:33:35,563 --> 00:33:37,702
That's an interesting way
to pass your time.

601
00:33:37,739 --> 00:33:40,074
Okay, there was a gun.

602
00:33:40,107 --> 00:33:42,180
...found on Charles Randall
when he was arrested.

603
00:33:42,219 --> 00:33:43,397
Yeah.

604
00:33:43,435 --> 00:33:46,469
Now in all the other shootings
the gun was left at the scene...

605
00:33:46,507 --> 00:33:49,540
...but there are a lot of similarities.
So I mentioned it to Perez and Riley.

606
00:33:49,579 --> 00:33:51,553
I think somebody should go
interview him in prison.

607
00:33:51,595 --> 00:33:54,115
I think there may be a connection.

608
00:33:54,155 --> 00:33:57,472
That's a good idea,
but not Perez and Riley.

609
00:33:57,515 --> 00:33:59,849
I mean, not those guys.
They'll screw it up.

610
00:33:59,883 --> 00:34:01,923
This is too important.

611
00:34:01,963 --> 00:34:04,330
Turk and I will handle Randall, okay?

612
00:34:04,364 --> 00:34:05,858
Good work.

613
00:34:36,012 --> 00:34:38,281
Detectives, Charles Randall.

614
00:34:40,044 --> 00:34:43,044
What the fuck
do you two scumbags want?

615
00:34:43,084 --> 00:34:45,670
What a greeting.

616
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:48,643
You like poetry, Chuck?

617
00:34:48,684 --> 00:34:49,699
What?

618
00:34:49,741 --> 00:34:52,807
Do you like poetry?

619
00:34:53,804 --> 00:34:57,350
Yeah.
Roses are red, violets are blue...

620
00:34:57,388 --> 00:35:00,203
I want to poke out your fucking eyes
with my dick, you fuck.

621
00:35:00,237 --> 00:35:02,146
How's that?

622
00:35:02,188 --> 00:35:04,709
I thought you'd rhyme.
You didn't.

623
00:35:04,749 --> 00:35:06,822
Fuck you.
Fuck both of you.

624
00:35:06,861 --> 00:35:08,421
Get me out of here.

625
00:35:17,997 --> 00:35:20,201
Why the fuck did we even bother
going out there?

626
00:35:20,237 --> 00:35:22,244
What would it look like
if we didn't go?

627
00:35:23,917 --> 00:35:26,022
Are you gonna relax?

628
00:35:26,061 --> 00:35:27,971
Relax.

629
00:35:28,013 --> 00:35:29,835
Yeah, I'll just take it out
on Karen later.

630
00:35:29,869 --> 00:35:32,073
The more I'm with her,
the more abuse she wants.

631
00:35:32,109 --> 00:35:33,320
Sounds like fun.

632
00:35:33,357 --> 00:35:34,884
Hey, you want to take her
off my hands?

633
00:35:34,925 --> 00:35:39,202
Be careful, partner, because I have
a very special effect on women.

634
00:35:39,246 --> 00:35:40,391
Go wild.

635
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:41,771
Whatever.

636
00:35:41,805 --> 00:35:44,675
I can't believe I had to face
that piece of shit and look like an idiot.

637
00:35:44,717 --> 00:35:47,881
Eh, fuck him.
He's where he belongs.

638
00:35:47,917 --> 00:35:49,478
I'm sorry, partner,
I'm really sorry.

639
00:35:49,517 --> 00:35:52,332
Stop worrying about it.

640
00:35:54,094 --> 00:35:57,639
Whatever happens,
I'm not taking you down with me.

641
00:35:57,678 --> 00:36:00,525
Don't worry about me.
I'm all right, believe me.

642
00:36:00,558 --> 00:36:03,689
I don't know what I was thinking.
I just don't know what I was thinking.

643
00:36:03,726 --> 00:36:05,962
You know what you was thinking?
You were thinking.

644
00:36:05,998 --> 00:36:08,551
...about a 10-year-old girl
who had her skull crushed.

645
00:36:09,518 --> 00:36:11,885
Yeah, I tried to stop you,
but you know what?

646
00:36:11,918 --> 00:36:16,009
I admired you that day,
what you did.

647
00:36:16,046 --> 00:36:18,893
That was righteous.

648
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:22,603
And you don't second-guess yourself
on something like that.

649
00:36:29,327 --> 00:36:31,236
Okay, I'm the killer.

650
00:36:31,279 --> 00:36:33,700
I'm the killer.
I show up at your door.

651
00:36:33,742 --> 00:36:35,652
...or your car window...

652
00:36:35,695 --> 00:36:37,899
...and for some reason
you open your door...

653
00:36:37,934 --> 00:36:40,749
...you roll down
your car window for me.

654
00:36:40,783 --> 00:36:42,888
So who am I?

655
00:36:42,926 --> 00:36:45,196
Someone I know.

656
00:36:45,231 --> 00:36:46,660
Maybe a nice set of tits.

657
00:36:46,703 --> 00:36:48,710
And the poems?
What about the poems?

658
00:36:48,751 --> 00:36:51,020
You have to compose the poem
before you got there, right?

659
00:36:51,055 --> 00:36:52,965
Otherwise what, you're gonna
blow out the guy's brains...

660
00:36:53,007 --> 00:36:54,796
...sit down and write a little sonnet
for yourself?

661
00:36:54,831 --> 00:36:56,173
No prints on the poems...

662
00:36:56,207 --> 00:36:59,077
...so probably
I wore gloves when I wrote it.

663
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:02,054
You obviously know your victims.
Between that and the easy access...

664
00:37:02,095 --> 00:37:04,332
I guess that they know you too.
They must.

665
00:37:04,367 --> 00:37:06,702
These guys are all scumbags.
They're not gonna trust anyone...

666
00:37:06,735 --> 00:37:09,190
...open the door for anyone,
especially if they don't know them.

667
00:37:09,232 --> 00:37:11,468
Yeah, but I more than know them.

668
00:37:11,504 --> 00:37:13,740
I know everything about them.
I know their moves...

669
00:37:13,776 --> 00:37:15,564
...their patterns,
I know their schedules.

670
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,283
Okay, so you're following them.
You're staking them out.

671
00:37:30,992 --> 00:37:33,480
Anyone gonna say it?

672
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,375
What?

673
00:37:37,776 --> 00:37:40,329
Fuck me.

674
00:37:41,937 --> 00:37:43,725
- He's right, it's a cop.
- No.

675
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,964
Let's slow down, fellows.
We're getting way ahead of ourselves.

676
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,448
- Come on, it's a cop, you know it.
- I don't know shit. Neither do you.

677
00:37:49,488 --> 00:37:52,238
I'm telling your right now,
it's a cop, it's a cop, it's a cop.

678
00:37:52,272 --> 00:37:53,898
What do you mean,
"It's a cop, it's a cop, it's a cop"?

679
00:37:53,936 --> 00:37:57,068
- Where do you come off saying it's a cop?
- Easy, partner, he's just saying it.

680
00:37:57,104 --> 00:37:59,625
- What are you talking about?
- He's just saying...

681
00:37:59,665 --> 00:38:02,829
I know, I know, I know
what he's saying.

682
00:38:04,432 --> 00:38:06,123
And I'm saying it's bullshit.

683
00:38:07,089 --> 00:38:09,936
Shoot me. What the fuck?
But don't say it's a cop.

684
00:38:13,873 --> 00:38:16,972
You cast a spell on me.

685
00:38:17,008 --> 00:38:19,464
I was blind and now I see.

686
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:22,374
You work your magic,
that's the key.

687
00:38:22,417 --> 00:38:24,872
You wave your wand.

688
00:38:24,913 --> 00:38:28,328
And cast a spell on me...

689
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:30,279
Turk: So what about dinner?

690
00:38:30,321 --> 00:38:31,848
You feel like going out?

691
00:38:31,889 --> 00:38:33,613
Where?

692
00:38:33,649 --> 00:38:35,438
I don't care.
You're the one going.

693
00:38:35,473 --> 00:38:37,229
What is your problem?

694
00:38:37,266 --> 00:38:39,175
No problem.

695
00:38:39,217 --> 00:38:41,257
If you feel like hanging around,
be my guest.

696
00:38:41,298 --> 00:38:42,574
I don't feel like going out.

697
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:45,643
Fine, just don't bug me.

698
00:38:45,682 --> 00:38:49,642
This is the best part of my day
and I don't need you fucking it up.

699
00:38:51,377 --> 00:38:54,247
So you only fuck cops?

700
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:57,040
Once in a while
I do a fireman or an ex-con.

701
00:38:58,897 --> 00:39:00,490
You lump us in together?

702
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:02,570
Well, I have some respect
for firemen.

703
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:04,333
Fuck you.

704
00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:06,225
You know why they take away
your nightstick.

705
00:39:06,258 --> 00:39:08,397
- when you hang up your uniform?
- No.

706
00:39:08,434 --> 00:39:10,539
They don't trust you with it.

707
00:39:10,578 --> 00:39:12,650
Right now I wouldn't trust
myself with it either.

708
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:14,632
Shit, you'd probably love that.

709
00:39:14,674 --> 00:39:16,267
Too bad you never met
Van Luytens.

710
00:39:16,306 --> 00:39:17,932
You two really would have
hit it off great.

711
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:20,043
At least somebody finally
brought some justice down.

712
00:39:20,082 --> 00:39:21,838
...on that dickless little fuck.

713
00:39:21,875 --> 00:39:24,079
Now that is who I'd like to meet.

714
00:39:24,114 --> 00:39:25,936
Well, maybe you'll get
your wish one day.

715
00:39:25,971 --> 00:39:27,727
They think it's a cop.

716
00:39:27,762 --> 00:39:29,323
- Makes sense.
- Bullshit.

717
00:39:29,362 --> 00:39:31,272
It's just some fucking psychopath.

718
00:39:31,315 --> 00:39:33,551
Well, there's plenty of those
on the job.

719
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:43,145
- Are you sleeping well?
- Not really.

720
00:39:43,187 --> 00:39:44,649
- Yep.
- Eating well?

721
00:39:44,691 --> 00:39:46,098
- No.
- Yeah.

722
00:39:46,131 --> 00:39:47,276
Any recurring nightmares?

723
00:39:47,315 --> 00:39:49,704
Yeah, that I'm stuck
in a room with you forever.

724
00:39:50,867 --> 00:39:52,176
Nope.

725
00:39:52,211 --> 00:39:53,934
Do you think you're fit
to return to duty?

726
00:39:53,971 --> 00:39:55,880
- Abso-fucking-lutely.
- Yeah.

727
00:39:55,923 --> 00:39:58,923
- You ever think about retiring?
- You mean, death with benefits?

728
00:39:58,963 --> 00:40:00,687
What's not to like?

729
00:40:00,723 --> 00:40:02,611
- You ever think about retiring?
- Not really.

730
00:40:02,643 --> 00:40:04,553
What have I got to look forward to?

731
00:40:04,595 --> 00:40:06,700
Sailing my 26-footer
around Sheepshead Bay...

732
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:08,114
...umpiring cops' softball?

733
00:40:08,147 --> 00:40:10,155
- How about corporate security work?
- It's too dangerous.

734
00:40:10,195 --> 00:40:13,326
- So what are you gonna do?
- Maybe I'll buy a boat.

735
00:40:13,364 --> 00:40:14,367
Turk: All right, look,
I don't know if I believe this...

736
00:40:14,401 --> 00:40:15,370
Turk: All right, look,
I don't know if I believe this...

737
00:40:15,411 --> 00:40:17,102
...but I'm just gonna
throw it out there.

738
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:19,376
You guys say we're looking
for one of our own...

739
00:40:19,412 --> 00:40:23,209
...but what if it was an ex-cop,
somebody with an axe to grind?

740
00:40:23,252 --> 00:40:24,845
You got one in mind?

741
00:40:24,884 --> 00:40:27,884
He's thinking about Martin Baum.

742
00:40:27,923 --> 00:40:30,574
...our old lieutenant.

743
00:40:30,612 --> 00:40:32,881
So what's the story with him?

744
00:40:32,916 --> 00:40:34,826
He got fired a few years ago.

745
00:40:34,868 --> 00:40:37,934
I'm not saying there's any motive,
but he knew all the victims.

746
00:40:37,972 --> 00:40:41,388
Yeah, but Turk,
I knew most of those guys.

747
00:40:41,428 --> 00:40:44,461
So did you, Riley, Perez.
Even Karen knew 'em.

748
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,474
- I'm just throwing it out there.
- Well, maybe you killed 'em.

749
00:40:46,517 --> 00:40:49,681
Yeah, maybe I did.

750
00:40:49,716 --> 00:40:51,789
The poems and the placement
of the weapons.

751
00:40:51,828 --> 00:40:53,551
...are all we've got
linking the kills...

752
00:40:53,589 --> 00:40:56,174
which means what we gotta do now
is get humping on the forensics.

753
00:40:56,213 --> 00:40:58,482
That shouldn't be
too much of a problem.

754
00:40:58,516 --> 00:41:00,426
We already got the girl
working on that.

755
00:41:00,468 --> 00:41:04,080
That's right, Karen's been
humping on it all week, as we speak.

756
00:41:04,116 --> 00:41:06,483
What did you say?

757
00:41:06,517 --> 00:41:07,727
Here we go again.

758
00:41:07,765 --> 00:41:09,456
- You should watch your mouth.
- Oh, yeah?

759
00:41:09,493 --> 00:41:11,860
He didn't mean anything by it.
Karen and him are ancient history.

760
00:41:11,892 --> 00:41:13,965
- College boy can't speak for himself?
- Yeah, I can speak for myself.

761
00:41:14,004 --> 00:41:15,728
Let me speak for myself...
fuck you, Turk.

762
00:41:15,765 --> 00:41:17,653
Mutt, I'm gonna hit you
on the head with this barbell.

763
00:41:17,685 --> 00:41:19,693
I'm not better than you.
You're not better than me, man.

764
00:41:19,733 --> 00:41:21,358
You put your balls
in your pocket.

765
00:41:21,397 --> 00:41:22,990
And you, fellow officers...

766
00:41:23,029 --> 00:41:27,055
...a little courtesy
for a fellow professional, you know?

767
00:41:27,093 --> 00:41:29,995
Please. Are we gonna move on
here now?

768
00:41:30,037 --> 00:41:31,946
What are we doing?
Where were we?

769
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:35,405
Talking about Martin Baum.
What's his story?

770
00:41:35,445 --> 00:41:37,834
Some guys under him
got caught taking money.

771
00:41:37,877 --> 00:41:40,049
Baum stood up for them,
tried to cover it up.

772
00:41:40,085 --> 00:41:42,387
He do time?

773
00:41:42,421 --> 00:41:45,138
Well, they pressed charges,
but he plead out and resigned.

774
00:41:45,174 --> 00:41:47,083
So what's his beef with you?

775
00:41:47,126 --> 00:41:48,882
I could have lied to protect him,
but I didn't.

776
00:41:48,918 --> 00:41:51,788
Okay, but if he's got a beef with you,
why not go after you?

777
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:54,219
Why not kill you? Why go around
acting like a serial killer...

778
00:41:54,262 --> 00:41:56,051
...killing all these degenerates?
It doesn't make any sense.

779
00:41:56,086 --> 00:41:58,420
- I'm just telling you.
- I'm telling you it doesn't make sense.

780
00:41:58,454 --> 00:42:00,429
I'm throwing it out there.
I'm saying this is what it is.

781
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:02,477
You want to check him out or not?
I don't give a shit.

782
00:42:02,518 --> 00:42:04,939
- It doesn't make any sense.
- You're the ones that think it's a cop.

783
00:42:04,982 --> 00:42:06,837
I'm just saying here's a cop
with a chip on his shoulder.

784
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:08,779
Check him out if you want.
I don't give a shit.

785
00:42:08,822 --> 00:42:12,019
Calm down and give a better reason
why Baum could be a suspect, okay?

786
00:42:13,782 --> 00:42:16,116
PMS, gotta be.

787
00:42:22,615 --> 00:42:25,397
- Hey, guys.
- What's going on?

788
00:42:25,431 --> 00:42:27,732
I came over to bring you
the FBI report.

789
00:42:27,767 --> 00:42:29,654
...on the paper
and handwriting.

790
00:42:29,687 --> 00:42:31,727
You don't have a problem
with me looking over the evidence.

791
00:42:31,766 --> 00:42:34,100
...that I collected and processed
for you, do you?

792
00:42:34,135 --> 00:42:35,957
- No problem.
- Put it back, Karen.

793
00:42:35,991 --> 00:42:37,900
- This is fascinating.
- Let's go, come on.

794
00:42:37,942 --> 00:42:39,830
Come on, let's go, let's go.

795
00:42:39,862 --> 00:42:41,586
- What?
- Come on, let's go.

796
00:42:41,622 --> 00:42:43,564
Get your hands off me.

797
00:42:43,607 --> 00:42:45,745
I'll give you a little privacy.
I don't want to interrupt anything here.

798
00:42:45,783 --> 00:42:47,506
Are you afraid of me
looking at your old case files?

799
00:42:47,543 --> 00:42:49,910
- Is that it?
- Okay, I'm gone. Enjoy.

800
00:42:49,943 --> 00:42:51,853
- What?
- What is it with you?

801
00:42:51,895 --> 00:42:53,837
What is it with you?

802
00:42:57,047 --> 00:43:00,363
I'm sorry about last night, okay?

803
00:43:00,408 --> 00:43:02,961
I really am. It's a habit.

804
00:43:02,999 --> 00:43:05,781
Habits can be broken, right?

805
00:43:05,816 --> 00:43:07,157
That's bullshit.

806
00:43:07,191 --> 00:43:08,401
No.

807
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:10,807
I'm totally serious, all right?

808
00:43:12,215 --> 00:43:14,419
It's not bullshit...

809
00:43:14,456 --> 00:43:16,365
...really.

810
00:43:22,776 --> 00:43:25,143
Perez: Why do you think
Turk was so quick to take the lead.

811
00:43:25,175 --> 00:43:27,958
...on the poetry case, huh?
To keep us from finding the killer, man.

812
00:43:27,992 --> 00:43:30,261
That's what I would do
if I was covering my tracks.

813
00:43:30,296 --> 00:43:33,111
He sticks us on this Baum stakeout
'cause it's more misdirection.

814
00:43:33,144 --> 00:43:34,257
Makes sense.

815
00:43:34,296 --> 00:43:36,401
I hate that Turk, man.

816
00:44:03,896 --> 00:44:05,806
Hey, he's coming out.
He's coming out.

817
00:44:07,961 --> 00:44:10,198
Oh, at 2:45 in the morning.

818
00:44:13,337 --> 00:44:16,653
Is it killing time
or is he just killing time?

819
00:44:35,481 --> 00:44:37,870
Come on, Baum,
go kill someone already.

820
00:44:37,913 --> 00:44:40,335
Perez: Yeah, kill Turk, man.
He's the one setting you up.

821
00:44:40,377 --> 00:44:41,784
Do us all a favor.

822
00:44:46,714 --> 00:44:49,103
Hey, did you see Turk's
marksmanship scores?

823
00:44:49,146 --> 00:44:50,640
Did you see this?
It's ridiculous.

824
00:44:50,681 --> 00:44:52,504
Service... 99,
70 out of 100.

825
00:44:52,537 --> 00:44:55,833
Combat Association awards,
department commendations.

826
00:44:55,866 --> 00:44:58,168
This guy could take out your left nut
at 50 yards.

827
00:45:01,306 --> 00:45:03,248
Perez: Did you see the computer
trajectories, man?

828
00:45:03,290 --> 00:45:04,665
Not one stray slug.

829
00:45:04,698 --> 00:45:06,935
Even Berkowitz put a couple
in the Corinthian leather.

830
00:45:11,866 --> 00:45:14,233
Riley: What about Karen?
She come up with anything new?

831
00:45:14,266 --> 00:45:16,054
Perez: No, not yet.

832
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:17,977
If Baum kills somebody
I don't want us to be in the car.

833
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:20,279
waiting when it happens, okay?

834
00:45:22,043 --> 00:45:23,636
I'll go.

835
00:45:23,674 --> 00:45:25,584
Attaboy, Teddy, attaboy.

836
00:45:25,627 --> 00:45:26,936
I'm proud of you, son.

837
00:45:37,691 --> 00:45:39,763
You're Perez, right?

838
00:45:39,803 --> 00:45:41,079
Yeah.

839
00:45:41,115 --> 00:45:42,740
I'm Martin Baum.

840
00:45:46,203 --> 00:45:48,242
I got a permit for this.

841
00:45:48,283 --> 00:45:50,901
I work security
in the diamond district.

842
00:45:50,939 --> 00:45:53,623
So you figure it's a cop
doing the poetry killings?

843
00:45:53,659 --> 00:45:56,409
Someone says, "Check out Baum.
He thinks he got a raw deal. "

844
00:45:56,443 --> 00:45:58,778
That's what passes
for police work these days?

845
00:45:58,811 --> 00:46:00,240
Do you think
you got a raw deal?

846
00:46:00,283 --> 00:46:02,072
Damn straight.

847
00:46:02,108 --> 00:46:04,344
- Life sucks.
- Yeah.

848
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:06,835
- Everything okay, Simon?
- Teddy, where the fuck were you, man?

849
00:46:06,875 --> 00:46:09,079
Anything else you want to tell us,
Lieutenant Baum?

850
00:46:09,115 --> 00:46:12,858
- I got something for you in my pocket.
- Huh-uh!

851
00:46:14,332 --> 00:46:18,871
A passport, credit card receipts,
boarding passes.

852
00:46:18,907 --> 00:46:20,817
The day Brady was killed.

853
00:46:20,859 --> 00:46:22,939
I was escorting a client
to Brazil.

854
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:30,067
Man: Judgment is
the dominion of the Lord.

855
00:46:30,107 --> 00:46:32,890
And if this person,
this worthless rapist.

856
00:46:32,924 --> 00:46:35,346
...or murderer,
as you describe him...

857
00:46:35,388 --> 00:46:38,650
...if he is truly repentant
and seeks absolution...

858
00:46:38,684 --> 00:46:40,953
...it must be granted to him.

859
00:46:40,988 --> 00:46:43,322
Your name doesn't ring a bell...

860
00:46:43,356 --> 00:46:47,447
...but I've had so many
altar boys over the years.

861
00:46:51,388 --> 00:46:53,298
Turk's voice: So many altar boys.

862
00:46:53,341 --> 00:46:55,926
...that it's hard to remember
their names.

863
00:46:55,965 --> 00:46:58,899
My name is David Fisk,
Detective First Grade.

864
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:01,112
You may not
remember me now...

865
00:47:01,148 --> 00:47:04,182
...but I guarantee you'll remember my name
for the rest of your life.

866
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:07,930
Father Connell,
may he rot in hell.

867
00:47:07,964 --> 00:47:10,331
13 down, one to go.

868
00:47:18,429 --> 00:47:21,877
Karen: White underwear
below the knee.

869
00:47:21,917 --> 00:47:24,284
Briefs-style.

870
00:47:24,317 --> 00:47:26,652
Large tweezers.

871
00:47:26,685 --> 00:47:30,002
I am removing a card that has been
inserted in the rectum of the deceased.

872
00:47:30,045 --> 00:47:33,907
...and placing it
in a plastic evidence bag.

873
00:47:36,509 --> 00:47:40,087
- I'll be right back.
- All right.

874
00:47:41,694 --> 00:47:44,214
Hey. It's another one...

875
00:47:44,253 --> 00:47:46,359
...handwritten.

876
00:47:49,501 --> 00:47:52,152
"The old man
who the children trust...

877
00:47:52,190 --> 00:47:55,670
Unable to control his lust...

878
00:47:55,709 --> 00:47:58,492
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

879
00:47:58,526 --> 00:48:02,421
The church can't stop him.
Someone must. "

880
00:48:03,742 --> 00:48:05,651
I'll see what else I can find.

881
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:13,178
What's the matter with you?

882
00:48:13,214 --> 00:48:15,418
Father Connell gave me
my first communion.

883
00:48:15,454 --> 00:48:18,105
...back in Bensonhurst.

884
00:48:20,382 --> 00:48:22,771
Hey, guys.
Sorry we didn't get a chance to call.

885
00:48:22,814 --> 00:48:25,749
- Yeah, I bet you are.
- Go over there, take a look around.

886
00:48:25,790 --> 00:48:27,830
We'll compare notes later, okay?

887
00:48:27,871 --> 00:48:30,871
Looks like our friend just settled
an old score with the priest...

888
00:48:30,911 --> 00:48:32,820
...left him with his pants down.

889
00:48:32,863 --> 00:48:34,423
- Come on.
- No, look.

890
00:48:34,462 --> 00:48:35,869
Come on, don't talk like that.

891
00:48:35,903 --> 00:48:37,790
- Hey, look for yourself.
- Have a little respect.

892
00:48:39,262 --> 00:48:42,329
Next thing they're gonna tell us
Lieutenant Baum was an altar boy here.

893
00:48:42,367 --> 00:48:45,662
Tell me about it.
These two guys fucking stink.

894
00:48:45,695 --> 00:48:47,931
Look, Doctor,
you read the poems.

895
00:48:47,967 --> 00:48:50,106
It is possible, right,
that this guy is a cop?

896
00:48:50,143 --> 00:48:52,412
I've never seen it.

897
00:48:52,447 --> 00:48:55,130
I've never even heard
about a cop serial killer.

898
00:48:55,167 --> 00:48:57,240
Come on, girls,
let's go, let's go.

899
00:48:58,207 --> 00:49:02,004
Yeah. Go go go go go
go go go go!

900
00:49:02,047 --> 00:49:03,029
Safe.

901
00:49:03,071 --> 00:49:05,438
Doc, give us a tip.
How are we gonna catch this guy?

902
00:49:05,472 --> 00:49:07,381
You don't have to worry
about that.

903
00:49:07,423 --> 00:49:09,016
He wants to get caught.

904
00:49:11,232 --> 00:49:13,785
You don't have any better place
to have lunch?

905
00:49:13,823 --> 00:49:15,547
I wanted to thank you.

906
00:49:15,583 --> 00:49:17,241
What, about Spider?

907
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,873
Yeah.

908
00:49:18,912 --> 00:49:21,400
And for looking in on me
at the hospital.

909
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:22,902
...and the encouragement.

910
00:49:22,944 --> 00:49:24,188
Why would he want that?

911
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:26,678
After a while
getting away with it isn't enough.

912
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,629
Jessica: So is your daughter
on the team?

913
00:49:28,671 --> 00:49:31,388
No, she used to play,
but now she's 25, living in California...

914
00:49:31,424 --> 00:49:34,010
...five years sober
and working as a nurse.

915
00:49:34,048 --> 00:49:36,120
And her mother?

916
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,102
Her mother died
when she was very young.

917
00:49:39,072 --> 00:49:41,887
Doctor: He wants everybody to know
that he got away with it...

918
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:45,782
...to show everybody
just how brilliant he is.

919
00:49:45,824 --> 00:49:48,858
Most of these killings were criminals
in Rooster's and his beat, right?

920
00:49:48,896 --> 00:49:50,685
And then he all but threatens
to kill Van Luytens.

921
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,608
...in front of hundreds of witnesses.
And then he sends us.

922
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:55,575
...on this crazy wild goose chase
after Lieutenant Baum, didn't he?

923
00:49:55,616 --> 00:49:57,526
- Yes, he did.
- Why would he do that? Why?

924
00:49:57,569 --> 00:49:59,990
You gotta show me more than that.
So far you got shit.

925
00:50:00,033 --> 00:50:01,560
- Give him more, man.
- You want more?

926
00:50:01,601 --> 00:50:04,121
- How about the church records?
- The very ones that Turk was.

927
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:06,015
...so diligently pursuing.
How about that?

928
00:50:06,049 --> 00:50:08,831
It turns out our most recent victim,
the late Father Connell...

929
00:50:08,865 --> 00:50:11,483
was moved all over the place...
eight parishes in 20 years.

930
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:13,909
Why would they do that
with a Catholic priest? It's obvious.

931
00:50:13,953 --> 00:50:16,342
He's giving the children
more than communion behind the altar.

932
00:50:16,385 --> 00:50:18,719
Now Turk already admits
to knowing this guy as a child.

933
00:50:18,753 --> 00:50:20,029
It's very plausible.

934
00:50:21,409 --> 00:50:24,443
Lieutenant: This priest,
this Father Connell...

935
00:50:24,481 --> 00:50:26,107
...he gave you your first
holy communion, eh?

936
00:50:26,145 --> 00:50:27,225
He did.

937
00:50:27,265 --> 00:50:30,364
Did he every try to do
anything inappropriate? I mean...

938
00:50:30,401 --> 00:50:32,311
I know what you mean.
No, never.

939
00:50:33,953 --> 00:50:35,862
Okay, fine.
Is there any reason.

940
00:50:35,905 --> 00:50:38,044
why somebody out there
might think that he did?

941
00:50:38,082 --> 00:50:39,576
No.

942
00:50:39,617 --> 00:50:41,854
Am I a suspect here, Lieutenant?

943
00:50:42,849 --> 00:50:44,791
No...

944
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:48,510
...but these bodies
are starting to smell.

945
00:50:48,546 --> 00:50:51,034
A lot of it is drifting
in your direction.

946
00:50:51,074 --> 00:50:52,983
Drifting or being pushed?

947
00:50:53,026 --> 00:50:55,033
What can I say?

948
00:50:55,073 --> 00:50:57,408
You got connections
to most of these victims.

949
00:50:57,442 --> 00:51:00,257
You're not exactly
Mother Teresa.

950
00:51:01,506 --> 00:51:04,288
I never had any problem
with that priest.

951
00:51:04,322 --> 00:51:07,136
Okay. Okay, fine.

952
00:51:07,170 --> 00:51:09,788
That settles it.

953
00:51:15,683 --> 00:51:17,690
I had a talk with Riley and Perez.

954
00:51:17,730 --> 00:51:19,192
Good cops.

955
00:51:19,234 --> 00:51:21,601
Don't fuck around, okay?
Just listen.

956
00:51:21,635 --> 00:51:22,845
I'm listening.

957
00:51:22,882 --> 00:51:25,184
They think
Turk might be our guy.

958
00:51:28,930 --> 00:51:31,069
Oh, man. I gotta tell you...

959
00:51:31,106 --> 00:51:33,692
...from where I'm sitting
that is so fucking funny.

960
00:51:33,730 --> 00:51:35,705
You can't take that seriously.

961
00:51:35,746 --> 00:51:38,594
Everybody has pretty much
accepted the fact.

962
00:51:38,626 --> 00:51:41,081
- That we're chasing one of our own.
- But it ain't Turk.

963
00:51:41,123 --> 00:51:42,813
Sure as I'm sitting here
he ain't the guy.

964
00:51:42,851 --> 00:51:44,411
- You know that?
- Yes, I do.

965
00:51:44,451 --> 00:51:46,818
- How do you know that?
- Because I know it.

966
00:51:46,851 --> 00:51:49,306
I know it to a moral certainty.

967
00:51:49,347 --> 00:51:50,754
Okay?

968
00:51:51,907 --> 00:51:53,817
This priest...

969
00:51:53,859 --> 00:51:56,347
...this Father Connell...

970
00:51:56,387 --> 00:51:58,591
...he was Turk's priest
when he was a kid.

971
00:51:58,627 --> 00:51:59,610
He told you that.

972
00:51:59,651 --> 00:52:01,855
He didn't tell me this priest
was a child molester.

973
00:52:01,891 --> 00:52:04,706
- I can't believe this bullshit.
- Believe it, all right?

974
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:07,195
- Turk's a good guy.
- You understand?

975
00:52:07,235 --> 00:52:09,406
- He's the best cop you got.
- Don't you tell me what I gotta do.

976
00:52:09,444 --> 00:52:11,418
Don't you say a goddamn word
to him about this either...

977
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:13,315
...or you're finished.

978
00:52:22,851 --> 00:52:24,761
Can I speak now?

979
00:52:24,804 --> 00:52:26,528
Feel free.

980
00:52:27,491 --> 00:52:31,168
He cares.
You know what I'm saying?

981
00:52:31,204 --> 00:52:33,986
Turk cares about people.

982
00:52:35,267 --> 00:52:38,137
I know he runs around
like a pit bull on crack sometimes.

983
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:40,668
It doesn't matter.

984
00:52:40,708 --> 00:52:42,880
He cares about protecting people.

985
00:52:42,916 --> 00:52:44,891
And if you don't back him...

986
00:52:44,932 --> 00:52:48,644
...you will regret it.

987
00:53:08,997 --> 00:53:10,426
Jesus.

988
00:53:10,469 --> 00:53:12,127
Sorry.

989
00:53:12,164 --> 00:53:14,750
I just never rattled
anyone's cage before.

990
00:53:14,788 --> 00:53:17,723
- Got a minute?
- Yeah, what's up?

991
00:53:17,764 --> 00:53:21,026
You know me and Turk
are buddies, right?

992
00:53:21,061 --> 00:53:22,490
Of course.

993
00:53:22,533 --> 00:53:23,962
I'd do anything for him.

994
00:53:24,005 --> 00:53:26,307
He would do anything for you.

995
00:53:26,341 --> 00:53:27,519
Would you?

996
00:53:27,557 --> 00:53:29,019
Would I what?

997
00:53:29,061 --> 00:53:31,003
Would you do anything for him?

998
00:53:34,405 --> 00:53:36,129
I don't know...
where is this going?

999
00:53:36,165 --> 00:53:38,107
He wants you
to have sex with me.

1000
00:53:40,165 --> 00:53:41,987
Really?

1001
00:53:43,814 --> 00:53:45,570
He wouldn't mind.

1002
00:53:45,605 --> 00:53:48,191
But that's not why I'm here.

1003
00:53:48,229 --> 00:53:50,782
Okay, why are you here?

1004
00:53:50,821 --> 00:53:53,920
Where were you
the night Rambo was killed.

1005
00:53:53,958 --> 00:53:56,805
...and Trager?
Got an alibi for those nights?

1006
00:53:58,246 --> 00:54:01,344
I mean, did you know either one
those guys before they were murdered?

1007
00:54:01,382 --> 00:54:04,229
Makes you uncomfortable
when I talk like that.

1008
00:54:04,262 --> 00:54:06,945
You look like you're guilty.
You're not guilty.

1009
00:54:06,982 --> 00:54:08,989
I know that.
You didn't kill those guys, did you?

1010
00:54:12,518 --> 00:54:15,420
Now you know what Turk feels.

1011
00:54:19,302 --> 00:54:22,880
I need you to get me
some information.

1012
00:54:22,918 --> 00:54:24,860
...discreetly.

1013
00:54:26,438 --> 00:54:27,812
Can you do that for me?

1014
00:54:27,846 --> 00:54:30,017
You got it.

1015
00:54:30,055 --> 00:54:31,648
Absolutely.

1016
00:54:31,686 --> 00:54:33,596
Let's solve these fucking murders.

1017
00:54:37,798 --> 00:54:39,107
Oh.

1018
00:54:39,143 --> 00:54:41,150
- Rooster: Hey, boy genius.
- Perfect timing, buddy.

1019
00:54:41,190 --> 00:54:43,133
Listen, you really worked
on Hingis, didn't you?

1020
00:54:43,175 --> 00:54:44,800
He was all worked up
about my partner.

1021
00:54:44,839 --> 00:54:46,661
Good. He should be.

1022
00:54:46,694 --> 00:54:49,150
I think we should sit down,
see if we can square things, okay?

1023
00:54:49,191 --> 00:54:52,257
All right. Want to meet at Montrose
at 8:00 PM?

1024
00:54:52,295 --> 00:54:55,459
Could you make that 9:00?
I gotta meet an old friend.

1025
00:54:55,495 --> 00:54:57,055
Yeah, sure, whatever you want.

1026
00:54:59,495 --> 00:55:02,659
Baby's got issues.

1027
00:55:02,695 --> 00:55:06,012
Baby's got pains...

1028
00:55:06,055 --> 00:55:07,965
- Hey, fellows.
- Hey.

1029
00:55:08,008 --> 00:55:11,041
Thanks for coming.

1030
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:13,600
- This here is Cheryl Brooks.
- Hello, Cheryl Brooks.

1031
00:55:13,639 --> 00:55:15,549
Cheryl's got something to tell you.

1032
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:20,160
My daughter Lynn.

1033
00:55:20,199 --> 00:55:22,621
...died four years ago.

1034
00:55:22,663 --> 00:55:25,478
She was 10 years old.
She was raped and she was murdered.

1035
00:55:27,496 --> 00:55:31,457
The guy I was living with,
Charles...

1036
00:55:31,496 --> 00:55:32,609
Charles Randall.

1037
00:55:32,648 --> 00:55:35,615
Yeah, Charles Randall... He did it.

1038
00:55:35,656 --> 00:55:38,339
Why are you telling us this?

1039
00:55:38,376 --> 00:55:41,376
Because he got off for that.
He was acquitted at trial.

1040
00:55:41,416 --> 00:55:43,554
- Because?
- Because?

1041
00:55:45,256 --> 00:55:47,460
I testified for him.

1042
00:55:47,496 --> 00:55:50,213
- You did what?
- I said he was with me.

1043
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:55,265
You see, Cheryl here is
a very forgiving person...

1044
00:55:55,304 --> 00:55:57,508
...unlike us hard-asses.

1045
00:55:57,544 --> 00:55:59,716
- He threatened to kill me.
- Okay, Cheryl.

1046
00:55:59,752 --> 00:56:03,068
Now you say goodbye
to the nice officers.

1047
00:56:03,113 --> 00:56:06,790
...and you go on back home.

1048
00:56:06,824 --> 00:56:09,508
Don't drink yourself to death.

1049
00:56:11,528 --> 00:56:13,950
Okay, so...

1050
00:56:13,993 --> 00:56:16,262
...eh?

1051
00:56:19,049 --> 00:56:21,668
I want to hear you say it.

1052
00:56:21,705 --> 00:56:24,193
Come on, say it.

1053
00:56:28,457 --> 00:56:32,286
We planted the gun
in Randall's apartment, okay?

1054
00:56:32,329 --> 00:56:34,566
I said it. Happy?

1055
00:56:34,601 --> 00:56:36,128
- Thank you.
- Yes, I am.

1056
00:56:36,169 --> 00:56:38,820
I'd do it again if I had to
'cause that fucking maggot.

1057
00:56:38,858 --> 00:56:42,502
...could rot away for all eternity.
I'd sleep just fine.

1058
00:56:42,538 --> 00:56:43,879
So what do you want from us?

1059
00:56:43,913 --> 00:56:46,302
You guys think
my partner's a serial killer.

1060
00:56:46,345 --> 00:56:48,069
You're way off.

1061
00:56:48,105 --> 00:56:51,040
You like Turk for this thing?
Go have your fun.

1062
00:56:51,082 --> 00:56:53,384
I'll go along with you.

1063
00:56:53,417 --> 00:56:55,872
I'll even help you.

1064
00:56:55,914 --> 00:56:59,427
But do not drag up Chuck Randall
and that fucking gun...

1065
00:56:59,466 --> 00:57:02,761
...because if he walks out of jail
he's gonna end up dead.

1066
00:57:02,794 --> 00:57:04,769
Excuse me?

1067
00:57:06,282 --> 00:57:09,577
I'll put two
through his fucking head.

1068
00:57:09,610 --> 00:57:12,065
...myself.

1069
00:57:12,106 --> 00:57:14,277
Done deal.

1070
00:57:26,795 --> 00:57:29,609
My grandmother loved opera.

1071
00:57:29,642 --> 00:57:31,584
She supported us by sewing.

1072
00:57:31,626 --> 00:57:34,594
I used to thread needles
for my grandmother.

1073
00:57:34,635 --> 00:57:36,839
- Gave all her money to church.
- You admired her?

1074
00:57:36,874 --> 00:57:38,914
I worshipped her.

1075
00:57:38,954 --> 00:57:41,638
Rooster? Yeah, he's religious,
goes to church.

1076
00:57:41,674 --> 00:57:43,300
Prosky: How about you?

1077
00:57:43,338 --> 00:57:46,786
Turk's voice: Our job is keeping
990/0 of the population safe.

1078
00:57:46,826 --> 00:57:50,122
...from the other 10/0.

1079
00:57:50,154 --> 00:57:53,602
The problem is that we have to
spend half our lives with that 10/0.

1080
00:57:53,643 --> 00:57:55,366
And the better we do that job...

1081
00:57:55,403 --> 00:57:57,859
...the less the other 990/0 think
they need us.

1082
00:57:57,899 --> 00:58:00,419
They're clueless.

1083
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:02,314
The only ones paying attention
on the street.

1084
00:58:02,347 --> 00:58:04,649
...are the cops and the criminals.
Everyone else is just.

1085
00:58:04,683 --> 00:58:07,334
...going somewhere
or shopping.

1086
00:58:12,747 --> 00:58:14,852
- Umpire: Out.
- Come on.

1087
00:58:14,892 --> 00:58:17,281
I got an order here placing you
on restricted duty.

1088
00:58:17,324 --> 00:58:19,713
Now in plain English that means
you'll work at your desk.

1089
00:58:19,756 --> 00:58:21,731
You might want to cooperate
with the shrink.

1090
00:58:21,772 --> 00:58:24,423
...next time you two meet,
and you will meet again.

1091
00:58:28,203 --> 00:58:31,018
Cool my fucking heels.
Cool my fucking heels, huh?

1092
00:58:31,052 --> 00:58:33,670
I'm gonna blow a fucking hole
in that motherfucker Perez.

1093
00:58:33,707 --> 00:58:36,457
...and blow right through his head
for putting me through this bullshit.

1094
00:58:36,492 --> 00:58:38,314
- Turk.
- Fuck, I'm gonna...

1095
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:39,592
...kill that motherfucker.

1096
00:58:39,628 --> 00:58:42,311
Calm down. What the hell is it?
You're making all the wrong moves.

1097
00:58:42,348 --> 00:58:44,104
What are you talking about?
This ain't a chess game, partner.

1098
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:46,474
Who knows? Maybe it is.
You go at Perez now...

1099
00:58:46,508 --> 00:58:48,897
...you know what's gonna happen?
You're gonna walk right into a trap.

1100
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:51,013
You are.
They're just waiting for you.

1101
00:58:51,052 --> 00:58:52,678
Fucking Hingis.

1102
00:58:52,716 --> 00:58:54,887
Fucking Hingis believes him.

1103
00:58:54,925 --> 00:58:57,794
He actually fucking believes
that motherfucking Perez.

1104
00:58:57,836 --> 00:58:59,265
Stay back. Wait.

1105
00:58:59,309 --> 00:59:02,604
Wait for the right time,
then fire away.

1106
00:59:02,637 --> 00:59:04,425
Not now. Now is not the right time.

1107
00:59:04,461 --> 00:59:06,665
Believe me.

1108
00:59:06,701 --> 00:59:08,938
You believe me?
Now is not the time.

1109
00:59:08,973 --> 00:59:10,020
Uh-huh.

1110
00:59:10,061 --> 00:59:12,101
- Please.
- Yeah.

1111
00:59:12,141 --> 00:59:15,753
Hey, Turk, I gotta skip tonight.
My class ran late.

1112
00:59:15,789 --> 00:59:18,091
But I'll see you
tomorrow, all right?

1113
00:59:18,124 --> 00:59:20,907
And I'm sorry about what happened
with you and Lieutenant Hingis today.

1114
00:59:20,941 --> 00:59:22,981
It's gonna be fine.
It'll blow over.

1115
00:59:23,021 --> 00:59:25,836
People are just... Everyone's crazy.
People are overreacting.

1116
00:59:25,869 --> 00:59:28,422
All right? Good night.

1117
00:59:34,413 --> 00:59:36,486
It's a cop, it's a cop, it's a cop.

1118
00:59:45,261 --> 00:59:47,563
What you got for me, good-looking?

1119
00:59:52,558 --> 00:59:55,492
Mark my words, there's a reason
Perez is gunning for me.

1120
00:59:55,534 --> 00:59:58,152
Perez is too smart to be that stupid.

1121
00:59:58,189 --> 01:00:00,710
For one thing, all that college-boy crap...
that's bullshit.

1122
01:00:00,750 --> 01:00:02,889
He did one year at SUNY,
only one year.

1123
01:00:02,926 --> 01:00:03,875
No kidding.

1124
01:00:03,918 --> 01:00:06,219
They threw him out...
disruptive influence.

1125
01:00:06,254 --> 01:00:08,840
And I hear from the 240 he mixed it up bad
with a captain over there.

1126
01:00:08,878 --> 01:00:11,017
The guy is a total
fucking asshole.

1127
01:00:11,054 --> 01:00:12,810
BMW 3 series...

1128
01:00:12,846 --> 01:00:15,082
Mercedes CLK... Too light.

1129
01:00:15,118 --> 01:00:17,965
BMW 7 series...
the biggest engine.

1130
01:00:17,998 --> 01:00:20,551
That's what you have to get.
If they shoot at you...

1131
01:00:20,590 --> 01:00:23,274
...you still want
to get the fuck out of there...

1132
01:00:24,942 --> 01:00:26,698
Bentley... Very good.

1133
01:00:26,735 --> 01:00:29,386
...because can fuck two prostitutes
in back seat.

1134
01:00:29,422 --> 01:00:33,000
...and mount flame-thrower
on the hood. Da?

1135
01:00:33,039 --> 01:00:34,315
Da.

1136
01:00:34,351 --> 01:00:36,587
- Man: What about a Cadillac?
- Russian: Come on...

1137
01:00:36,623 --> 01:00:39,972
...the fucking car can't turn
fucking corner. Are you kidding me?

1138
01:00:40,015 --> 01:00:41,771
You know either one of those
Neanderthals?

1139
01:00:41,806 --> 01:00:44,457
The wop is Joe Scianci from Bensonhurst.
He's a mid-level guy.

1140
01:00:44,495 --> 01:00:46,349
What about Ivan?

1141
01:00:46,383 --> 01:00:48,139
Russian guy,
Yevgeny Magulat...

1142
01:00:48,175 --> 01:00:52,136
...an enforcer for the Italians,
works with Gambinos a lot.

1143
01:00:56,399 --> 01:00:58,952
That shit's getting to me.

1144
01:00:58,991 --> 01:01:00,933
I know it's getting to you.

1145
01:01:02,608 --> 01:01:04,942
Shit gets to me too, you know...

1146
01:01:04,975 --> 01:01:07,943
...but I take it in, I let it out
on my own terms.

1147
01:01:09,487 --> 01:01:11,462
I bet you didn't write
one word down.

1148
01:01:11,504 --> 01:01:13,326
...in that little notebook
Prosky gave us.

1149
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:15,815
Of course not. Did you?

1150
01:01:15,855 --> 01:01:18,092
Yeah, it's great.

1151
01:01:19,599 --> 01:01:21,868
It helps me put things in perspective.

1152
01:01:21,904 --> 01:01:25,733
You know what I'm saying?
Write it down, get it out.

1153
01:01:25,776 --> 01:01:28,197
- You should try this.
- Let's have a look.

1154
01:01:28,239 --> 01:01:30,760
What, are you kidding me?
Oh, come on, come on.

1155
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:33,167
This belongs to me... Private.

1156
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:37,390
- You don't want to let me see?
- Close to my heart. No, sir.

1157
01:01:37,424 --> 01:01:39,529
I just got sick
of the whole fucking game...

1158
01:01:39,568 --> 01:01:41,935
...run around looking for clues,
making arrests...

1159
01:01:41,968 --> 01:01:44,390
write reports, testify, cut deals.

1160
01:01:44,432 --> 01:01:47,214
It was all just so much
fucking bullshit.

1161
01:01:50,001 --> 01:01:51,113
Detective...

1162
01:01:56,625 --> 01:01:57,967
Then it all got real simple.

1163
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,902
Yeah, Detective Perez here.
Hey, brother, what's up?

1164
01:02:00,944 --> 01:02:03,759
I hate scumbags. I like shooting people.
What was I giving up?

1165
01:02:03,793 --> 01:02:06,662
Perez: Hey, look, I set the meeting up
with Rooster first thing tomorrow.

1166
01:02:06,705 --> 01:02:09,966
Come on, you gotta be fast, man.
I don't want Turk getting wind of anything.

1167
01:02:10,001 --> 01:02:12,270
A retirement party and a gold watch?

1168
01:02:12,304 --> 01:02:14,988
A handshake from the mayor
and my name on some fucking plaque?

1169
01:02:20,977 --> 01:02:22,122
Big fucking deal.

1170
01:02:24,273 --> 01:02:25,255
It's better this way.

1171
01:02:26,993 --> 01:02:29,710
Now everybody knows
who I was and where I stood.

1172
01:03:11,410 --> 01:03:13,319
Hey, it's me.

1173
01:03:14,738 --> 01:03:18,055
Listen, I think somebody
followed me here... Home.

1174
01:03:18,098 --> 01:03:20,465
He's outside right now.

1175
01:03:20,499 --> 01:03:24,044
Can you come over or?...

1176
01:03:24,083 --> 01:03:27,017
Just call me back, okay?
All right.

1177
01:03:55,955 --> 01:03:58,224
Don't move.

1178
01:04:10,579 --> 01:04:13,481
- Come on, open up.
- Turk?

1179
01:04:18,515 --> 01:04:20,588
I just called you.

1180
01:04:20,628 --> 01:04:22,155
Put the gun down.

1181
01:04:22,195 --> 01:04:24,105
There's a car following me.

1182
01:04:24,148 --> 01:04:26,799
Put the gun down.
Put the gun down.

1183
01:04:30,548 --> 01:04:31,977
Have you got
something to tell me?

1184
01:04:32,020 --> 01:04:33,743
About what?

1185
01:04:33,780 --> 01:04:36,235
Trager, Randall.

1186
01:04:36,276 --> 01:04:38,186
Did you sneak
into my apartment?

1187
01:04:38,228 --> 01:04:40,137
What are they doing
on your computer?

1188
01:04:40,180 --> 01:04:42,319
I was checking
all the links in the case.

1189
01:04:45,524 --> 01:04:47,150
Are you hiding something
from me?

1190
01:04:50,260 --> 01:04:51,754
Huh?

1191
01:04:53,204 --> 01:04:55,954
I just received this... This poem.

1192
01:04:55,989 --> 01:04:58,476
A poem?
Not worth mentioning, huh?

1193
01:04:58,517 --> 01:05:00,938
The handwriting
doesn't even match.

1194
01:05:00,981 --> 01:05:03,086
It's a fake.

1195
01:05:03,124 --> 01:05:05,034
Did you write it?

1196
01:05:06,805 --> 01:05:09,260
Did you write it?

1197
01:05:13,301 --> 01:05:15,756
What the hell is going on here?

1198
01:05:15,797 --> 01:05:17,870
You're spending a lot of time
with Perez, aren't you?

1199
01:05:17,909 --> 01:05:19,698
Yeah, I've been working the case.

1200
01:05:19,733 --> 01:05:21,806
What, are you jealous?

1201
01:05:21,845 --> 01:05:24,496
Can I trust you?

1202
01:05:26,549 --> 01:05:29,167
- Yes.
- Okay.

1203
01:05:29,205 --> 01:05:31,539
Get me anything and everything
that you can find out.

1204
01:05:31,573 --> 01:05:33,907
...about Perez or Riley,
what they know about me.

1205
01:05:35,573 --> 01:05:37,329
Everything.

1206
01:05:37,365 --> 01:05:39,732
Karen, don't play me.

1207
01:05:40,949 --> 01:05:44,462
Hingis: I am leaning much further
into saying that it is a cop.

1208
01:05:44,502 --> 01:05:47,698
Perez: Tell you what... I'm moving
past the leaning stage.

1209
01:05:47,734 --> 01:05:50,417
...and I'm moving towards the
I- Know-for-sure-it's-a-fucking-cop stage...

1210
01:05:50,454 --> 01:05:52,690
...considering how expertly
he shot the shit out of my house.

1211
01:05:52,726 --> 01:05:54,897
Hingis: Oh my God.
Are you hurt?

1212
01:05:54,934 --> 01:05:56,941
Am I hurt? Am I hurt?
He wants to know if I'm hurt.

1213
01:05:56,982 --> 01:05:58,453
Actually, he's dead.

1214
01:06:01,046 --> 01:06:04,242
- Rooster: His name is Magulat.
- Turk: The guy we saw at Salerno's.

1215
01:06:04,278 --> 01:06:07,212
Yeah, he's in intensive care
at St. Luke's.

1216
01:06:07,254 --> 01:06:09,163
They think he's the guy.

1217
01:06:09,206 --> 01:06:11,573
- Chopped off Yakov Pearlstein's head.
- What do you think?

1218
01:06:11,606 --> 01:06:13,745
You think he's a victim,
or could he be our suspect?

1219
01:06:13,782 --> 01:06:16,684
I don't know, but either way
I think it's gonna be fun.

1220
01:06:17,686 --> 01:06:20,469
Doctor, what's the story?

1221
01:06:20,502 --> 01:06:23,372
He's one of the toughest human beings
I've ever come into contact with.

1222
01:06:23,414 --> 01:06:25,105
We took six bullets
out of him.

1223
01:06:25,142 --> 01:06:26,931
Six? Whoo!

1224
01:06:26,966 --> 01:06:29,617
Three from the night he was wounded,
three from previous shootings.

1225
01:06:29,654 --> 01:06:31,477
The man is a tank.

1226
01:06:31,510 --> 01:06:33,485
Do you mind if I talk to him
a little bit?

1227
01:06:33,526 --> 01:06:36,047
His jaw's wired shut,
but go ahead.

1228
01:06:36,087 --> 01:06:38,869
That's okay. I'll ask the questions.
He can just grunt.

1229
01:06:38,903 --> 01:06:41,718
Hey, Yevgeny.

1230
01:06:41,751 --> 01:06:43,890
Wake up.

1231
01:06:43,926 --> 01:06:48,433
That's it. Wake up,
you big fucking grizzly bear.

1232
01:06:48,471 --> 01:06:50,773
You don't speak Russian?

1233
01:06:50,807 --> 01:06:54,254
Swoboda. Swoboda. Swoboda.

1234
01:06:54,295 --> 01:06:56,684
Ron.

1235
01:07:01,303 --> 01:07:04,402
I'm thinking this Russian killing machine
could be our first eyewitness.

1236
01:07:07,064 --> 01:07:09,813
Wake up, gugumuck.
You can tell us who did this to you.

1237
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:17,175
Detective, I think that's enough.

1238
01:07:17,208 --> 01:07:20,524
Then you could tell us where you put
Yakov Pearlstein's head.

1239
01:07:23,799 --> 01:07:26,581
4-3, 4-3, I need a round-the-clock
security detail.

1240
01:07:26,616 --> 01:07:30,707
...on a patient Magulat,
M- A-gulat...

1241
01:07:30,744 --> 01:07:32,849
St. Luke's in the ICU.

1242
01:07:34,616 --> 01:07:38,325
I wake up in the morning...

1243
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:41,491
Is this the number to call
to report a case of police brutality?

1244
01:07:41,528 --> 01:07:44,844
- Cat got your tongue?
- Out on bail again?

1245
01:07:44,888 --> 01:07:47,059
What, you think you can scare me,
little bitch? What do you want?

1246
01:07:47,096 --> 01:07:49,332
Be careful, Detective.
My taxes pay your salary.

1247
01:07:49,368 --> 01:07:51,856
You don't pay any fucking taxes,
you lowlife piece of shit.

1248
01:07:51,896 --> 01:07:54,165
- Get to the point, come on.
- One of your vics, Trager...

1249
01:07:54,201 --> 01:07:56,721
...stole a whole lot of guns
down South.

1250
01:07:56,760 --> 01:07:58,768
Same guns are turning up
on your murder scenes.

1251
01:07:58,808 --> 01:08:00,052
So it's simple...

1252
01:08:00,088 --> 01:08:02,510
...find stolen guns,
you got your guy.

1253
01:08:02,552 --> 01:08:04,308
So you know the guy?

1254
01:08:04,345 --> 01:08:07,028
Do you know if there's a cop out there
who might be a danger to the public?

1255
01:08:07,064 --> 01:08:09,715
I couldn't live with myself
if I just stood by and didn't say anything.

1256
01:08:09,753 --> 01:08:12,622
Look, I'm gonna give you
two seconds more. Give me yes or no.

1257
01:08:12,664 --> 01:08:15,479
Do you know the guy?
And when do I meet you to talk about it?

1258
01:08:15,513 --> 01:08:18,131
Friday, 9:00 PM, at my club.

1259
01:08:18,168 --> 01:08:19,281
I'll be there.

1260
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:21,262
Man, there's dumb
and there's dumber...

1261
01:08:21,305 --> 01:08:23,672
...but this is the motherfucking dumbest
right here, man.

1262
01:08:23,705 --> 01:08:25,778
Easy, son, easy.
It's gonna be easy for you.

1263
01:08:25,817 --> 01:08:29,265
All you gotta do is be bait, that's all.
Be a little sardine for us, all right?

1264
01:08:29,305 --> 01:08:31,858
You help us... we got you covered.
Your club doesn't get hassled.

1265
01:08:31,897 --> 01:08:34,319
...and you don't have a revolving door
in and out of jail.

1266
01:08:34,361 --> 01:08:35,888
Do we have a deal or not?

1267
01:08:35,929 --> 01:08:39,191
Yeah, but your boy come in here
and go Hannibal Lecter on my ass...

1268
01:08:39,226 --> 01:08:41,647
I don't want no Jodie fucking Foster
coming through the door.

1269
01:08:41,689 --> 01:08:43,446
I want the goddamn
Marine Corps, man.

1270
01:08:43,481 --> 01:08:46,961
Since Color Me Badd was singing
"I wanna sex you up"...

1271
01:09:14,810 --> 01:09:16,239
Evening, Detective.

1272
01:09:16,282 --> 01:09:19,367
You want one? It's shit,
but it's better than nothing, right?

1273
01:09:19,401 --> 01:09:22,453
Turk's voice: As soon as I heard
the fucking Russian didn't die.

1274
01:09:22,490 --> 01:09:24,661
I knew things would never
be the same.

1275
01:09:24,699 --> 01:09:26,771
I had to change the rules...

1276
01:09:26,810 --> 01:09:28,720
...the strategy.

1277
01:09:28,762 --> 01:09:32,374
I had to be bold, do something
that could never be undone.

1278
01:09:39,899 --> 01:09:42,107
I went for the unforgivable.

1279
01:10:08,091 --> 01:10:10,677
No. Please. No.

1280
01:10:31,803 --> 01:10:34,553
Karen over phone: Did you hear
anything I just said?

1281
01:10:35,676 --> 01:10:39,254
How exactly could I be
blowing this out of proportion?

1282
01:10:39,292 --> 01:10:41,364
That psycho just assaulted me.

1283
01:10:41,403 --> 01:10:44,567
I am telling you
he is a classic sociopath.

1284
01:10:44,604 --> 01:10:46,644
Okay okay,
I'll look into it, all right?

1285
01:10:46,684 --> 01:10:48,113
I'll look into it.

1286
01:10:48,156 --> 01:10:50,229
You stay the hell away from here.
Understood?

1287
01:10:50,268 --> 01:10:51,992
Understood?

1288
01:10:53,981 --> 01:10:55,257
Fuck that.

1289
01:11:06,205 --> 01:11:08,409
Man: Check the ball,
check the ball.

1290
01:11:09,852 --> 01:11:12,951
I got the ball. I got the ball. I got the ball.
Stay on him. Stay on him.

1291
01:11:12,988 --> 01:11:14,843
Karen: Excuse me,
I'm Detective Corelli.

1292
01:11:14,877 --> 01:11:17,691
- I need to see your reservation book.
- Woman: Sure. Help yourself.

1293
01:11:24,829 --> 01:11:26,968
- Thank you.
- Anytime.

1294
01:11:27,005 --> 01:11:28,631
Yes, this is Detective Corelli.

1295
01:11:28,669 --> 01:11:31,003
I've been trying to reach
Detectives Perez and Riley.

1296
01:11:31,037 --> 01:11:32,892
...and I can't seem
to locate them.

1297
01:11:32,925 --> 01:11:35,795
- Perez: I like to party.
- That's nothing. I was into Kiss.

1298
01:11:35,837 --> 01:11:37,746
I used to run
around the house.

1299
01:11:37,790 --> 01:11:39,830
with my tongue hanging out,
spitting fake blood.

1300
01:11:39,869 --> 01:11:41,113
I need to speak to them
urgently.

1301
01:11:44,797 --> 01:11:48,059
Yes, I understand,
but I need the location, please.

1302
01:12:15,454 --> 01:12:17,843
Hey, he's here.

1303
01:12:17,886 --> 01:12:19,031
Turk: Let me in.

1304
01:12:24,286 --> 01:12:25,387
Thank God it's the police.

1305
01:12:25,420 --> 01:12:26,489
Thank God it's the police.

1306
01:12:26,526 --> 01:12:28,763
Yeah, so where do we go?

1307
01:12:28,798 --> 01:12:30,653
Follow me.

1308
01:12:30,687 --> 01:12:32,891
I used to play ball
a couple of blocks from here.

1309
01:12:32,926 --> 01:12:34,104
Get the fuck out of here.

1310
01:12:34,142 --> 01:12:36,957
When I was a kid I wasn't afraid
to mix it up with guys like you.

1311
01:12:36,991 --> 01:12:38,235
You still ain't.

1312
01:12:38,271 --> 01:12:40,693
Yeah, nowadays
I carry a gun with me.

1313
01:12:40,735 --> 01:12:43,866
It's a bad neighborhood.

1314
01:12:43,903 --> 01:12:45,812
- It ain't bad for me.
- Yeah, well...

1315
01:12:45,854 --> 01:12:48,156
Yeah, he's inside.

1316
01:12:48,191 --> 01:12:49,685
Well, so far so good.

1317
01:12:49,727 --> 01:12:52,215
So now that we're done with
the pleasantries, what do you got for me?

1318
01:12:52,255 --> 01:12:53,433
Rooster: He's talking.

1319
01:12:53,471 --> 01:12:55,381
- What did you think he was gonna do?
- Spider: How about an apology?

1320
01:12:55,423 --> 01:12:58,074
Spider: The shit that happened to Stubby,
that wasn't supposed to happen.

1321
01:12:58,111 --> 01:13:01,494
- Rooster: Lieutenant, that's a crock of shit.
- I lost three fucking teeth that day.

1322
01:13:01,535 --> 01:13:03,706
He's not a civilian.
He's a fucking dealer.

1323
01:13:03,743 --> 01:13:05,717
- And I kept my mouth shut.
- So what?

1324
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:08,924
You guys love those stupid gold teeth.
You should thank me.

1325
01:13:08,959 --> 01:13:11,676
Well, he's wearing a vest
and Starsky and Hutch here.

1326
01:13:11,712 --> 01:13:14,614
...are watching him like a couple
of hawks... Gay hawks.

1327
01:13:14,655 --> 01:13:17,688
Yeah, right there, buddy.

1328
01:13:17,728 --> 01:13:20,575
All right, enough bullshit.
So you know our poetry boy?

1329
01:13:20,608 --> 01:13:22,517
Just talk to me.
What do you got for me?

1330
01:13:22,559 --> 01:13:24,534
- All right, here we go.
- Here we go.

1331
01:13:24,575 --> 01:13:25,982
Would you please?

1332
01:13:26,016 --> 01:13:28,733
Just 'cause the guy's talking tough,
that don't mean shit.

1333
01:13:28,767 --> 01:13:30,491
Let me ask you something,
Copernicus.

1334
01:13:30,527 --> 01:13:33,015
That gun on his belt...
do you think it's a service pistol?

1335
01:13:33,055 --> 01:13:35,608
I bet you we'll trace it back to Trager's.
What do you think about that?

1336
01:13:35,648 --> 01:13:37,306
- What do you want to bet?
- 500 bucks.

1337
01:13:37,343 --> 01:13:39,383
- You're on.
- I'm in for another five.

1338
01:13:39,424 --> 01:13:41,693
Oh, this is fun.

1339
01:13:41,728 --> 01:13:43,833
Look, I help you,
you reciprocate.

1340
01:13:43,872 --> 01:13:45,279
So help me.

1341
01:13:45,312 --> 01:13:47,516
All right, you might see
a little bit of a cell-phone video.

1342
01:13:47,552 --> 01:13:49,526
I got it in front of Trager's
the night he bought it.

1343
01:13:49,568 --> 01:13:51,422
- You got what?
- I got a movie...

1344
01:13:51,456 --> 01:13:54,805
...a couple of kids back from the prom,
preserving their special memories...

1345
01:13:54,848 --> 01:13:56,474
...a positive ID of you, big time.

1346
01:13:56,512 --> 01:13:58,585
- Oh, yeah? Of me?
- Yeah.

1347
01:13:58,624 --> 01:14:00,282
Okay.

1348
01:14:00,321 --> 01:14:01,782
Now you know
what I'm talking about.

1349
01:14:01,824 --> 01:14:04,094
Yeah, now I got it.

1350
01:14:04,128 --> 01:14:05,983
Yeah, well,
so how do I look?

1351
01:14:08,928 --> 01:14:10,422
Like a poet?

1352
01:14:11,393 --> 01:14:12,986
'Cause that's what I am,
you know, a poet.

1353
01:14:13,024 --> 01:14:15,610
All right, come on, let's go.

1354
01:14:15,648 --> 01:14:18,169
In fact, I wrote a poem for you, Spider.
Want to hear it?

1355
01:14:18,209 --> 01:14:20,064
Eh?

1356
01:14:23,776 --> 01:14:27,125
Drop your gun right now, motherfucker!
Drop to the ground right now!

1357
01:14:27,169 --> 01:14:28,925
Oh! Oh! Grease me up and...

1358
01:14:28,961 --> 01:14:30,936
I mean, do they actually pay
you two morons?

1359
01:14:30,977 --> 01:14:34,108
- Put the fucking weapon on the ground.
- Gladly. Gladly. Right there.

1360
01:14:34,145 --> 01:14:36,032
Right there. There you go.

1361
01:14:37,153 --> 01:14:38,976
Hey, you want to read my poem?

1362
01:14:39,009 --> 01:14:40,384
Easy easy.

1363
01:14:40,417 --> 01:14:41,661
Here, read it.

1364
01:14:43,745 --> 01:14:45,916
"You tried to set me up, you fucks...

1365
01:14:45,954 --> 01:14:47,677
And this is how you do it?

1366
01:14:47,714 --> 01:14:50,332
You thought I'd get
my dick cut off...

1367
01:14:50,369 --> 01:14:52,824
Instead you only blew it. "

1368
01:14:52,866 --> 01:14:54,808
Great stuff.

1369
01:14:54,849 --> 01:14:57,118
- What is that shit?
- Thank you.

1370
01:14:57,154 --> 01:14:59,488
That is poetry.

1371
01:14:59,522 --> 01:15:01,180
What are you doing here?

1372
01:15:01,217 --> 01:15:02,973
Well, don't look at me, partner...

1373
01:15:03,010 --> 01:15:05,399
...but I tagged along
to protect your ass.

1374
01:15:05,442 --> 01:15:08,638
...and to see the look on their faces.
It was worth it.

1375
01:15:08,674 --> 01:15:10,943
We're doing our jobs here, okay?
I'm not gonna apologize for that.

1376
01:15:10,978 --> 01:15:13,498
I never want you to apologize, Teddy.
There's a killer out there with a badge.

1377
01:15:13,538 --> 01:15:15,611
- What are you morons doing about it?
- What do you think we're doing here?

1378
01:15:15,650 --> 01:15:17,439
- That's not it.
- No, that's not it.

1379
01:15:17,474 --> 01:15:19,297
I just made 1000 bucks.

1380
01:15:19,330 --> 01:15:21,119
Where's the other gun?
Give it to me.

1381
01:15:21,154 --> 01:15:22,878
Why don't you frisk me, Sherlock?
Go ahead.

1382
01:15:22,914 --> 01:15:25,019
- Frisk me, go ahead. Go ahead.
- Yeah, I'm gonna frisk you.

1383
01:15:27,970 --> 01:15:30,523
Ooh, nice touch, Mary.

1384
01:15:30,563 --> 01:15:32,635
What are you doing after work?
Unless you're committed.

1385
01:15:32,674 --> 01:15:34,813
I don't want to get
in the middle of anything.

1386
01:15:34,851 --> 01:15:37,949
What happened to your face?
Your mick friend give you a little love bite?

1387
01:15:37,987 --> 01:15:41,216
- Shut the fuck up. Shut your fucking face.
- Hey hey hey! Whoa!

1388
01:15:41,250 --> 01:15:43,869
I'll blow your brains out
if you don't get the fuck away.

1389
01:15:43,907 --> 01:15:45,980
What's he talking about?

1390
01:15:46,019 --> 01:15:47,742
- What's he talking about?
- What he's talking about is...

1391
01:15:47,779 --> 01:15:50,015
...just 'cause you didn't go for this
doesn't mean you're not our guy.

1392
01:15:50,051 --> 01:15:52,320
- Now we gotta break this shit up.
- Don't translate for me, man.

1393
01:15:52,354 --> 01:15:54,875
Rooster: Will you let this go?
You fucked up, okay?

1394
01:15:54,915 --> 01:15:57,337
- We fucked up 'cause you helped him.
- I'm gonna nail your ass.

1395
01:15:57,379 --> 01:15:59,648
I'm not through with you, man.
Make a mistake.

1396
01:15:59,683 --> 01:16:01,592
Rooster: I'm gonna
break this stuff down, okay?

1397
01:16:01,635 --> 01:16:03,774
You fucking dog.

1398
01:16:05,251 --> 01:16:07,902
Relax, Spider.

1399
01:16:07,939 --> 01:16:10,176
Come on, let's have a drink.

1400
01:16:10,211 --> 01:16:13,626
I saw what I think
is a refrigerator here.

1401
01:16:17,667 --> 01:16:19,260
I'll be back in a second.

1402
01:16:27,844 --> 01:16:29,273
Hey, muffinhead.

1403
01:16:32,356 --> 01:16:33,763
Is this the person
who shot you?

1404
01:16:34,724 --> 01:16:36,579
You're sure?

1405
01:16:42,084 --> 01:16:44,026
No, you're the pumpkinhead.

1406
01:16:54,820 --> 01:16:56,708
You miss me?

1407
01:16:58,660 --> 01:17:00,897
"... Of death and pain...

1408
01:17:00,932 --> 01:17:03,005
Place oneself among the slain.

1409
01:17:03,044 --> 01:17:05,466
If one addiction goes unfed...

1410
01:17:05,509 --> 01:17:07,713
The world is better with him dead. "

1411
01:17:25,541 --> 01:17:26,718
Take it easy.

1412
01:17:26,757 --> 01:17:28,448
It's okay.
It's gonna be all right.

1413
01:17:28,485 --> 01:17:30,624
Jesus Christ, Rooster.

1414
01:17:30,661 --> 01:17:33,411
Just move into the room. Here.

1415
01:17:33,445 --> 01:17:35,812
Sit down. Sit down.

1416
01:17:38,597 --> 01:17:40,507
Okay.

1417
01:17:40,549 --> 01:17:44,095
You gotta know about this,
Tom, from me.

1418
01:17:44,133 --> 01:17:47,100
Now just open that little book,
start reading.

1419
01:17:47,142 --> 01:17:49,509
Everything you want to know
is in there.

1420
01:17:51,461 --> 01:17:53,371
So go ahead.

1421
01:17:54,885 --> 01:17:56,795
Out loud.

1422
01:17:58,086 --> 01:18:00,093
For the record.

1423
01:18:00,133 --> 01:18:02,784
See the little video here?

1424
01:18:08,934 --> 01:18:12,163
"My name is David Fisk,
Detective First Grade.

1425
01:18:12,198 --> 01:18:16,093
I've been a cop in the NYPD
for nearly 30 years. "

1426
01:18:17,158 --> 01:18:20,541
- Dave, Dave, Dave, Dave.
- Tom...

1427
01:18:20,582 --> 01:18:23,550
we've got a lot to cover
and not much time to do it in, so...

1428
01:18:26,694 --> 01:18:29,761
"My name is David Fisk,
Detective First Grade. "

1429
01:18:29,798 --> 01:18:32,220
My name is David Fisk.

1430
01:18:32,263 --> 01:18:35,165
"I've been a cop in the NYPD
for nearly 30 years. "

1431
01:18:35,206 --> 01:18:37,956
I don't expect you
to remember me.

1432
01:18:37,990 --> 01:18:39,932
I mean, it's been a long time.

1433
01:18:39,975 --> 01:18:43,619
...since you sat me on your lap
and told me you loved me.

1434
01:18:43,654 --> 01:18:46,589
"In that time.

1435
01:18:46,630 --> 01:18:49,249
I've killed 14 people. "

1436
01:18:50,310 --> 01:18:52,220
Rooster: But I guarantee.

1437
01:18:52,263 --> 01:18:55,297
...you're gonna remember the name
for the rest of your life.

1438
01:19:05,383 --> 01:19:08,831
"You don't become a cop
because you want to serve and protect.

1439
01:19:10,215 --> 01:19:13,149
You join the force because they let you
carry a gun and a badge.

1440
01:19:13,192 --> 01:19:15,745
Most people respect the badge.

1441
01:19:15,783 --> 01:19:17,790
Everybody respects the gun. "

1442
01:19:17,832 --> 01:19:20,549
I'm the killer.
I show up at your door.

1443
01:19:20,583 --> 01:19:23,300
Turk: What are you talking about?
It's not a fucking chess game.

1444
01:19:23,336 --> 01:19:26,303
Who knows? Maybe it is.
You're making all the wrong moves.

1445
01:19:26,343 --> 01:19:28,448
I'm gonna put two
through his fucking head.

1446
01:19:28,488 --> 01:19:30,724
...myself.

1447
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:32,832
I know it to a moral certainty.

1448
01:19:32,872 --> 01:19:35,293
You sort of get numb to it.

1449
01:19:44,456 --> 01:19:47,074
"Tom Cowen was my role model.

1450
01:19:56,745 --> 01:19:58,949
The day I stopped trying to be him.

1451
01:19:58,984 --> 01:20:01,221
was the greatest day of my life.

1452
01:20:05,096 --> 01:20:08,260
Several years back I framed
a lowlife child killer.

1453
01:20:08,296 --> 01:20:10,850
...named Charles Randall.

1454
01:20:12,553 --> 01:20:14,855
I should have known
it would come back to haunt me. "

1455
01:20:18,888 --> 01:20:21,158
What do you want me
to do with this?

1456
01:20:22,889 --> 01:20:25,223
Is that all you got to say?

1457
01:20:25,257 --> 01:20:27,395
I owe you this explanation, pal.

1458
01:20:27,433 --> 01:20:29,375
Why are you telling me now?

1459
01:20:29,417 --> 01:20:33,574
Lvan the Terrible
is gonna wake up pretty soon.

1460
01:20:33,609 --> 01:20:35,332
...and he's gonna ID me.

1461
01:20:40,681 --> 01:20:42,437
Evening, Detective.

1462
01:20:42,474 --> 01:20:45,321
You want one? It's shit,
but it's better than nothing, right?

1463
01:20:45,354 --> 01:20:49,347
I can just walk right in here.
Your partner's asleep. Step outside.

1464
01:20:49,386 --> 01:20:52,103
Did I ever pick
the wrong fucking Russki to shoot?

1465
01:21:01,098 --> 01:21:03,399
Now we're going off the record.

1466
01:21:05,834 --> 01:21:09,478
Uh, I'm going to take the rap
for the Randall gun thing.

1467
01:21:09,513 --> 01:21:11,269
You saw that.

1468
01:21:11,306 --> 01:21:14,339
I mean, considering
the circumstances, why not?

1469
01:21:14,378 --> 01:21:16,745
No need to thank me.

1470
01:21:17,898 --> 01:21:19,752
That business about not being me...

1471
01:21:19,786 --> 01:21:21,215
Yeah.

1472
01:21:21,258 --> 01:21:23,146
I don't get that.

1473
01:21:23,178 --> 01:21:27,008
Well, you're a great cop, Tom.

1474
01:21:27,050 --> 01:21:28,959
I mean, you were the one.

1475
01:21:29,003 --> 01:21:31,937
I aspired to all my life
and could never be.

1476
01:21:33,451 --> 01:21:35,752
Then you broke the law...

1477
01:21:35,786 --> 01:21:38,819
...planted the gun on Randall...

1478
01:21:38,859 --> 01:21:41,990
...let me down.

1479
01:21:43,659 --> 01:21:45,514
I lost my faith.

1480
01:21:47,019 --> 01:21:50,815
That's when it all started.

1481
01:21:50,859 --> 01:21:53,412
And once it did...

1482
01:21:53,451 --> 01:21:55,393
I couldn't stop.

1483
01:21:56,715 --> 01:22:00,260
Finally...

1484
01:22:00,299 --> 01:22:02,688
I didn't want to.

1485
01:22:08,843 --> 01:22:12,258
So I did my own thing.

1486
01:22:12,299 --> 01:22:14,787
And you know what? In the end.

1487
01:22:14,827 --> 01:22:17,031
...it got done.

1488
01:22:17,067 --> 01:22:19,489
The scum went down.

1489
01:22:19,532 --> 01:22:21,320
And that's it. That's that.

1490
01:22:22,795 --> 01:22:24,999
I don't understand
a word you said...

1491
01:22:25,036 --> 01:22:27,108
- Don't understand any of it.
- I know you don't, Tom.

1492
01:22:27,148 --> 01:22:29,733
As soon as I heard
the Russian didn't die.

1493
01:22:29,772 --> 01:22:32,041
I knew I had to change the rules...

1494
01:22:32,075 --> 01:22:34,792
...do something that could
never be undone.

1495
01:22:34,828 --> 01:22:36,802
I went for the unforgivable.

1496
01:22:40,363 --> 01:22:41,825
No.

1497
01:22:43,244 --> 01:22:45,415
So what am I gonna do, my friend...

1498
01:22:45,452 --> 01:22:47,973
...partner? Arrest you?

1499
01:22:48,012 --> 01:22:50,762
At some point I gotta call it in.

1500
01:22:50,796 --> 01:22:52,138
We're a team.

1501
01:22:52,172 --> 01:22:53,798
We were.

1502
01:22:53,836 --> 01:22:55,746
Yeah, we were, a great team.

1503
01:22:55,788 --> 01:22:58,177
That was yesterday, Dave.

1504
01:22:58,220 --> 01:22:59,300
Today...

1505
01:23:01,325 --> 01:23:04,172
...today you're pointing a gun at me.

1506
01:23:08,429 --> 01:23:11,428
But it hasn't gone off yet.

1507
01:23:16,588 --> 01:23:18,017
Bye, Tom.

1508
01:23:18,060 --> 01:23:20,068
- Where are you going?
- I don't know.

1509
01:23:20,109 --> 01:23:22,989
To hell, I suppose.

1510
01:24:07,758 --> 01:24:09,700
- Hey, Dave, Dave.
- Whoa.

1511
01:24:09,741 --> 01:24:12,197
Don't come closer!

1512
01:24:12,238 --> 01:24:14,474
- You wouldn't.
- You want to bet your life on it?

1513
01:24:14,510 --> 01:24:16,397
Come on, partner, I know you.
You wouldn't.

1514
01:24:16,430 --> 01:24:18,699
But I would.

1515
01:24:18,734 --> 01:24:19,912
Oh.

1516
01:24:19,950 --> 01:24:21,859
Karen, just take it easy.

1517
01:24:21,902 --> 01:24:23,844
- Can't get me out of your mind?
- Shut up, Dave.

1518
01:24:23,887 --> 01:24:27,749
You're gonna defend
this lowlife piece of shit?

1519
01:24:27,790 --> 01:24:30,605
- Boy, I'm in your head.
- I'm not defending him. Take it easy.

1520
01:24:30,638 --> 01:24:33,672
Fuck you, Turk.
Put the gun down, Fisk.

1521
01:24:33,710 --> 01:24:35,117
- And if I don't?
- Dave.

1522
01:24:35,151 --> 01:24:37,802
- How about I blow your brains out?
- Ooh, I like the sound of that.

1523
01:24:37,838 --> 01:24:39,693
- Don't move.
- Karen.

1524
01:24:39,726 --> 01:24:42,028
You blow me away, Turk dies.
Is that your idea?

1525
01:24:42,063 --> 01:24:43,339
I said don't move, you prick.

1526
01:24:43,375 --> 01:24:45,579
Bye-bye!

1527
01:24:47,182 --> 01:24:48,709
Give me the gun.
Give me the gun.

1528
01:24:50,318 --> 01:24:51,944
Stay here.

1529
01:24:58,447 --> 01:24:59,789
Oh, man.

1530
01:25:01,071 --> 01:25:02,282
Fuck.

1531
01:25:03,759 --> 01:25:05,581
These old locks...

1532
01:25:05,615 --> 01:25:07,241
I mean, they're good.

1533
01:25:07,279 --> 01:25:09,167
Dave, you've got to end
this thing.

1534
01:25:09,199 --> 01:25:11,174
End it?

1535
01:25:11,215 --> 01:25:12,459
Put the gun down.

1536
01:25:12,496 --> 01:25:15,179
What's your plan?

1537
01:25:15,216 --> 01:25:17,419
Are you gonna arrest me?

1538
01:25:17,455 --> 01:25:20,172
Are you gonna take me down
to the precinct, book me...

1539
01:25:20,207 --> 01:25:23,721
...fingerprint me,
body-cavity-search me?

1540
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:25,549
What the fuck
are you gonna do?

1541
01:25:25,583 --> 01:25:28,398
Wheel me out on the "Geraldo" show,
a freak of the week?

1542
01:25:28,431 --> 01:25:32,938
Or better yet, an in-depth
psycho profile on "Oprah"?

1543
01:25:32,975 --> 01:25:35,179
Are you ready for that?
It ain't gonna fly, man.

1544
01:25:35,216 --> 01:25:37,485
Dave, you give me no choice.

1545
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:39,276
You got a choice... I escape.

1546
01:25:40,784 --> 01:25:42,955
Would you do that for me, Tom?

1547
01:25:44,016 --> 01:25:45,194
Would you let me escape?

1548
01:25:45,232 --> 01:25:46,694
Come on, don't do this.

1549
01:25:46,736 --> 01:25:48,973
I'm gonna make a run for it.

1550
01:25:49,008 --> 01:25:51,113
What do you think?

1551
01:25:51,152 --> 01:25:54,021
You gotta do the right thing.

1552
01:25:59,792 --> 01:26:01,767
That's a 10-10, partner...

1553
01:26:01,809 --> 01:26:05,038
...shots fired, suspect fleeing.
Let's go!

1554
01:26:05,072 --> 01:26:06,633
Come on, don't go there.

1555
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:11,015
Hey, partner, come on.
Shots fired.

1556
01:26:11,057 --> 01:26:13,391
- Don't do this.
- Suspect fleeing...

1557
01:26:13,425 --> 01:26:15,759
...resisting arrest. Come on.

1558
01:26:24,785 --> 01:26:27,567
A righteous man.

1559
01:26:27,601 --> 01:26:30,219
Before me stands...

1560
01:26:30,257 --> 01:26:34,448
A hero in these filthy lands.

1561
01:26:34,481 --> 01:26:37,743
A brother in arms...

1562
01:26:37,777 --> 01:26:41,094
In heart are you.

1563
01:26:41,137 --> 01:26:43,690
I was really hoping.

1564
01:26:43,729 --> 01:26:46,282
You'd get it too.

1565
01:26:49,617 --> 01:26:52,072
- I do get it.
- No, you don't.

1566
01:26:52,113 --> 01:26:53,968
No, I get it.

1567
01:27:00,050 --> 01:27:03,181
You know, the only thing
in this life.

1568
01:27:03,217 --> 01:27:05,935
...that ever gave me
any satisfaction.

1569
01:27:05,970 --> 01:27:07,792
was killing those fucks.

1570
01:27:09,650 --> 01:27:11,886
So this is for real.

1571
01:27:11,922 --> 01:27:14,191
I mean...

1572
01:27:14,226 --> 01:27:16,462
...this one is bad.

1573
01:27:18,546 --> 01:27:20,107
10-13.

1574
01:27:21,074 --> 01:27:23,179
Officer down.

1575
01:27:45,843 --> 01:27:48,778
I ain't going anywhere, Tom.

1576
01:27:48,819 --> 01:27:51,023
I ain't going anywhere.

1577
01:27:52,114 --> 01:27:54,831
It's okay.

1578
01:27:59,923 --> 01:28:02,541
3-4 squad, Central.
3-4 squad, Central.

1579
01:28:02,579 --> 01:28:04,968
10-13, officer down.
184th and St. Nick's.

1580
01:28:05,011 --> 01:28:07,629
Officer down, 10-13.
Hurry hurry hurry.

1581
01:28:07,667 --> 01:28:10,220
- Dispatcher: 10-4, 4 squad...
- Tom, don't. Don't.

1582
01:28:10,259 --> 01:28:13,674
- Officer down. ETA six minutes.
- Don't.

1583
01:28:13,715 --> 01:28:16,236
Don't.

1584
01:28:27,955 --> 01:28:29,898
Don't.

1585
01:28:38,004 --> 01:28:40,011
3-4 squad, Central.

1586
01:28:40,052 --> 01:28:42,540
Dispatcher: Central.
Go ahead, 4 squad.

1587
01:28:42,580 --> 01:28:45,002
That's a 10-55 on the bus.
Cancel the ambulance.

1588
01:28:45,044 --> 01:28:46,953
Dispatcher: 10-5?

1589
01:28:46,996 --> 01:28:49,930
Turk: Cancel the ambulance.
10-55 on the bus. Cancel the ambulance.

1590
01:28:49,972 --> 01:28:52,525
- You sure on that?
- Sure on that.

1591
01:29:01,300 --> 01:29:03,569
You did this, you know.

1592
01:29:05,076 --> 01:29:08,392
I know, partner, I know.

1593
01:29:11,412 --> 01:29:13,168
We did good, Tom.

1594
01:29:14,357 --> 01:29:16,691
Tom, Tommy.

1595
01:29:16,725 --> 01:29:20,303
We did good. We did good.

1596
01:29:21,941 --> 01:29:24,559
You're a good man, Tom.

1597
01:29:24,597 --> 01:29:26,931
You're a good man.

1598
01:29:28,245 --> 01:29:31,147
I wish you...

1599
01:29:31,189 --> 01:29:33,393
I wish you.

1600
01:29:33,429 --> 01:29:36,396
...continued success.

1601
01:30:16,406 --> 01:30:18,479
Some piece of work, your partner.

1602
01:30:18,518 --> 01:30:20,428
Lights.

1603
01:30:20,470 --> 01:30:22,193
Look, Cowen...

1604
01:30:22,230 --> 01:30:24,783
...the way we see it...

1605
01:30:24,822 --> 01:30:27,669
Detective Fisk just closed the door
on the poetry boy.

1606
01:30:34,326 --> 01:30:37,360
Good. Whatever you say.

1607
01:30:40,086 --> 01:30:42,453
Are we done?

1608
01:30:42,487 --> 01:30:44,429
Yeah, we're done.

1609
01:31:05,623 --> 01:31:07,379
Turk's voice: My daughter called.

1610
01:31:07,415 --> 01:31:10,928
She was upset about Rooster
and worried about me.

1611
01:31:10,967 --> 01:31:14,382
She asked me if I was likely
to do something stupid.

1612
01:31:14,424 --> 01:31:16,879
...and I said, "Like what...

1613
01:31:16,919 --> 01:31:19,821
...take anger management classes
or retire?"

1614
01:31:19,863 --> 01:31:22,995
I said I was gonna do
the same old thing I always do.

1615
01:31:23,031 --> 01:31:26,774
She said, "Good.
What else could you do?"

1616
01:31:26,807 --> 01:31:28,400
I said, "Right. "

1617
01:31:28,439 --> 01:31:31,342
A real chip off the old block,
my daughter.

1618
01:31:31,384 --> 01:31:34,482
She said I was a cop
and a good one.

1619
01:31:34,520 --> 01:31:37,935
Funny... Rooster said
the same thing.

1620
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:44,051
Turk: Okay, guys,
let's get ready to play ball.

1621
01:31:44,087 --> 01:31:47,765
On the count of three.
Everybody in?

1622
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:51,215
One, two, three, explosion!
