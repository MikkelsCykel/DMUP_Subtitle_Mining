1
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,280
Who's that?
Where you going, huh?

2
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:43,480
Wait...!

3
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,200
It’s you, isn’t it?

4
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,320
What happened?!

5
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,640
Help!

6
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,160
What the fuck is going on?

7
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,360
I know you’re here!

8
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,920
- You don’t even know my name!
- No. I know your voice!

9
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,360
Just say one more word!
I dare you!

10
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,520
Your dead friend
said the same thing!

11
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,720
Don't let them leave!

12
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,040
Do not let them leave!
You idiots!

13
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,600
Do not let them leave!

14
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:39,280
- Let’s go!
- You fucking jerks, stop them!

15
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,920
Come back!
Get back here!

16
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,960
That's it! That's it for you!
Ladies, no more food for you!

17
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:52,520
Every day we go without food,
one of your men will die!

18
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,600
We collect from now on!

19
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,480
You missed!

20
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,960
He's dead!

21
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:11,160
What’s going on?
Where are you? Where are you?

22
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,240
- Are you okay?
- Just go get the food.

23
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,160
They told me a man was killed.

24
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,560
I... I killed him.

25
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,440
Now there’s gonna be a war.
They’re going to want revenge.

26
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,760
We’re gonna barricade our doors.
We’ll use our beds like they did.

27
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,160
Whatever you say.
I’ll get the food.

28
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,200
Oh, shit!

29
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,520
- Barricade it. Barricade it!
- You got the door?

30
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,560
- Two beds!
- So fucking what...

31
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,840
if send the women there twice a
month? We'll get fucking fed!

32
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,440
Stand it up!
Barricade the thing!

33
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,560
What I suggest we do is we find
out who killed their leader...

34
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,680
and offer them up like
a peace offering.

35
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:09,840
- We don’t know what they’re gonna...
- In exchange for food!

36
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,000
They have a stock pile!
We’re in a state of war.

37
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,680
- And we started it.
- Yeah, exactly.

38
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:19,840
And I suggest we find out who killed
the leader, and we offer to the...

39
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,400
Look! Look!

40
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,800
If they won't give us food,
I say let's get it ourselves!

41
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,320
- I agree!
- Then, let’s go!

42
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,760
Okay, I think he's right.

43
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,520
If anyone's willing to go,
I think you should raise your hand.

44
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,440
That’s about the most ridiculous
thing I've ever suggested.

45
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,920
How about,
Whoever doesn’t wanna fight...

46
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,520
simply slip away right now,
and no one will know you were here?

47
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,200
And for those that are left, gather
around me, and we'll make a plan.

48
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,880
Here. Here.

49
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,720
Okay, how many of us are there?

50
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,920
- One.
- Two.

51
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,320
- Three.
- Twelve.

52
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,200
I can see twelve of us.

53
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,520
- What?
- She can see?

54
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,320
Don’t touch my fucking bed!

55
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:51,280
- What are you doing?
- What?

56
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,800
- I heard something!
- Someone’s here!

57
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,720
- Who’s there?
- I heard somebody!

58
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,920
- Who’s there?
- I heard somebody!

59
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,200
I have a chair over here.
If anybody could happen...

60
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,960
Let’s go, come on!
Grab the person in front of you.

61
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,960
Stay in a tight group!

62
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,920
Alright.
Straight ahead.

63
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,400
What...

64
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,880
If we go back!
We can’t go back! Come on.

65
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,800
Let’s move!

66
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,760
- What’s that?
- Smoke.

67
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,360
Fire!

68
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,600
Don’t push!

69
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,480
Fire!

70
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,000
It’s okay! It’s okay!
Stay there!

71
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,400
I’m gonna come in get you.

72
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,360
Upstairs.
Upstairs.

73
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,310
Watch!

74
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:55,600
- Here. Here I am. Hold on to him.
- They’re going to shoot us.

75
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:03,240
Guards! Guards!

76
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,720
You see what is going on?!

77
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,440
Guards!

78
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,480
We’re free!

79
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,920
It’s empty.
Go on in.

80
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,080
- Step up.
- We’re in a shop.

81
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:30,640
Everyone, please, stay together.
I don’t wanna loose anybody else.

82
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,960
Step up. All right.
I’m gonna go look for food.

83
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,640
- I’ll go with you.
- No, I can do better on my own.

84
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,560
Stay here and look after each other.
It’s something you can do better.

85
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,400
Get out!
This place is occupied!

86
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,320
There are other groups out there.
Do not leave this spot.

87
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,120
I know you can do it.

88
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,600
But how can you carry the
food back on your own?

89
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,480
Is there anything?
Is there running water?

90
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,120
I'll look for bottles.

91
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,200
- I guess there’s electricity.
- No.

92
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,080
Are there any signs that
people can still see?

93
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,200
What's happening?

94
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,760
I miss you.
I miss you so much.

95
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,800
Here’s a supermarket.
I’ll go in.

96
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,800
- Okay.
- Step up.

97
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,600
I’ll stay here.
I know my place.

98
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,720
Stay off my fucking spot!

99
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:42,640
I'm coming back! I'll fucking kill
you! You stay off my fucking spot!

100
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:48,160
Give it to me, you thief!
You thief! You thief! Give it back!

101
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,760
Hey! Hey!

102
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,920
I can here you near
my fucking spot!

103
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,960
Go! Go! Go!

104
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,560
What do you have there?!

105
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,240
What are you eating?!

106
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,920
Smells like meat!

107
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,560
- No! No!
- Stop!

108
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,240
Let on!

109
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:37,160
It’s me! It’s me!
Go! Go! Go!

110
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,920
Okay.

111
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,520
Are you alright?
Are you okay?

112
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,320
Okay. Okay.

113
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,880
- I have... I have to stop.
- Stop. Stop.

114
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,880
Stairs.

115
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:08,480
- You’re all right. You’re safe.
- Thank you.

116
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:12,520
I’ve go back and get those clothes
before I forget where they are.

117
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,320
Here, eat something.

118
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:12,840
I’m just trying to say...

119
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:21,120
people screaming out loud...

120
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,920
that God is hiding...

121
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,520
that we failed and
that God is punishing us.

122
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:32,080
This is not what is happening. God,
it’s not. This is not the God’s way.

123
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,240
What is happening to us reminds
me of what happened to St. Paul.

124
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:43,080
Paul used to kill Christians,
used to persecute them...

125
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,280
but the Lord came to
him and converted him.

126
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,320
And not only converted him,
but blinded him.

127
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,560
This is what's happening to us.

128
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,480
- Here!
- Here!

129
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,840
- Here I am!
- Here!

130
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,720
Here.
Here, I have a jacket.

131
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:17,080
- I have a jacket.
- Thank you.

132
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,360
That’s terrible.

133
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:49,080
- Who would do that?
- Someone who went blind.

134
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,040
And then he went crazy.
Since he couldn’t see...

135
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,000
he didn’t want his statue to see.

136
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,240
- I don’t think so, little man.
- I don’t know if it’d be possible...

137
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:59,040
for a blind man to paint
the painting like that.

138
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,080
- Yes, they could.
- Or likely a priest...

139
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,240
who saw what happened,
and had a crisis of faith.

140
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,640
No, but seriously, all those people
made me think of how lucky we are...

141
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,800
that we have a leader with vision.

142
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,560
So, I think it’s up to you to
decide what we should do next.

143
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,680
Well...

144
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:21,440
I think we should stay here tonight,
try to get some sleep.

145
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:26,800
And then, tomorrow, I was thinking
that we could go to our house.

146
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,440
It's pretty near here,
and it's big...

147
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,240
so it can accommodate everybody.

148
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,360
Where are you, dog?
Still there?

149
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:43,040
No. Don’t follow that dog.
He’ll lead you to a fire hydrant.

150
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:47,080
Too proud to be a seeing eye dog.

151
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,520
Twenty seven.
Five four.

152
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,400
Black hair.
Brown eyes.

153
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,360
I don’t wanna know
what you look like.

154
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,680
But how can we know each other?

155
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,960
I know that part inside
of you with no name.

156
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,160
And that's who we are, right?

157
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,000
When you went to look for food,
we talked to this man...

158
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,200
that was part of a group
that moved around together...

159
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,040
trying to find food and shelter.

160
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,400
Each night they slept
in a different place.

161
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,520
I asked him why he didn't
sleep in his own home.

162
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,080
And he said he didn’t know
where it was anymore.

163
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,840
- Yeah, he lost it.
- They're welcome to it...

164
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,720
if they can find their
way to my little room.

165
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,640
I think it’s okay. Here we are.

166
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,680
Here we are. Looks fine.
Come in. Come in.

167
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,960
I can’t believe it.

168
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,480
It’s exciting.

169
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,720
Okay. Careful. Just because
the door was locked...

170
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,600
doesn’t mean that no one’s here.

171
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,640
Hello! Hello!

172
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,840
Hello! Is anyone here?

173
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,760
Maybe we should take
our shoes off. Right?

174
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,840
That’s a good idea.
You can leave them by the door.

175
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,600
We don’t wanna mess the place up.
We just arrived.

176
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,400
If you wanna take off
your clothes too...

177
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,320
we have plenty of
clean ones upstairs.

178
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,160
- Thank you.
- Are you talking to me?

179
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:30,480
No, to everyone. Our clothes
are just as dirty as our shoes.

180
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,800
- Here? All together?
- Come on!

181
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,960
She’s the only one who can see!

182
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,680
If it makes you feel better,
it’s getting pretty dark.

183
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,840
All right.
If you insist.

184
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,480
I'm sure you've seen worse
sights than this old body.

185
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,920
I want you to feel at home here
because this is your home now too.

186
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,200
Thank you both. We're all flattered
that you would offer your home.

187
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,160
It's our pleasure.

188
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,200
Kick us out when you had enough.

189
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,560
Or when I become
too much of a burden.

190
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,840
Just tell me, and I’ll just
wander off like an elephant.

191
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,720
- You’re not an elephant.
- I’m not a man, either.

192
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,120
- You’re plenty of a man, babe.
- I...

193
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,640
I don’t know.

194
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,160
I haven’t seen myself in so long.
I must look ridiculous.

195
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:23,440
No, no. Dirty and skinny.
But not ridiculous. Not at all.

196
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,800
- And what about me?
- You’re beautiful.

197
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,480
Yeah. Not like you.

198
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,960
- You’ve never seen me.
- But in my dreams you’re beautiful.

199
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,280
How come you never appeared in my
dreams but I know you’re beautiful?

200
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,840
Well, that’s why blindness
is a gift to the ugly.

201
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,760
- Come on, you’re not serious.
- No...

202
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,680
but I suppose I was
more beautiful before!

203
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,280
We were all more beautiful before.

204
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,560
Is anyone cold?

205
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,160
- It feels so good!
- I'm having a great time!

206
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,400
Hello?

207
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,600
It's me.

208
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,040
- I brought you some hot water.
- Oh, thank you.

209
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,480
- I’m gonna pour it down, okay?
- Okay.

210
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,920
- Feels good?
- Feels good.

211
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,400
I hope we can find
the boy's parents.

212
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,640
What do you hope for?

213
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:58,360
Nothing is more ridiculous than
the desires of an old man.

214
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,640
Tell me. I wanna know.

215
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,960
You wouldn't understand.

216
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,400
- Why that tone of voice?
- What tone?

217
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,480
That one.

218
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:15,400
What I hope is that we
can go on living together.

219
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,800
- As we are. Like this.
- Blind?

220
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:23,320
For me nothing has been better.

221
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:30,320
- I’d want us to live together.
- Together with me, or with everyone?

222
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,480
Don’t make me say.

223
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,720
I want to know.

224
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,680
Are we alone?

225
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,800
Is anyone listening?

226
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,200
Good.

227
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,080
Good.

228
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,720
I wanna live with you.

229
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07,760
I remember that New Year’s.

230
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:12,720
It was cold, but I didn’t mind.

231
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:25,640
All right. At this end of the table
we have pees and carrots.

232
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:30,480
At the center we've olives in a bowl
and some crackers on a small plate.

233
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,560
And, at the far end of the table,
we have anchovies.

234
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,600
Anchovies!

235
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,240
Don't we have a special bottle of
something sparkling for our guests?

236
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:41,600
There's nothing like water.
Clean water.

237
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,520
I'd like to propose a toast.
To our family.

238
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,640
- To our human family.
- And the dog!

239
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,720
- And the dog!
- And the dog! And the dog!

240
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,560
- Salute!
- Salute!

241
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,360
Much better than any champagne.

242
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,960
I see you.

243
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:23,760
When I touch you like this,
I see your face.

244
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,960
So beautiful.

245
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,600
It's all I need to remember.

246
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:39,160
- Tell me, is this working?
- Let’s see. You take another one.

247
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,680
Take another of me in the face.

248
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,640
Blind inspiration.

249
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:47,080
There’s coffee,
if anybody wants some.

250
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:50,520
- I’ll have some, please.
- I want some too.

251
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,320
I need to wake up.

252
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,400
Honey? Honey?

253
00:27:55,920 --> 00:28:00,560
I think we should get together
and talk about what we need to do.

254
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:04,160
There’s not much food left,
and I'm worried about security.

255
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,080
- Okay.
- I can pour it for you.

256
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,400
It’s hot.

257
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,720
It’s you.

258
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:29,400
It’s you! Oh, my God!
It’s everyone at here.

259
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,120
Hi.

260
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,560
- What?
- I can see you!

261
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:37,120
- What are you saying?
- I can see you!

262
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,760
- What?
- Yes.

263
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,320
- What are you talking about?
- Everything is beautiful!

264
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,680
I can...

265
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,840
- What?
- Oh, my God!

266
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,720
- What do you mean, you can see?
- Hey, you! I can see you.

267
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,800
I got back my sight!

268
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,440
- What is it?
- Come here.

269
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,920
- I can see!
- How?

270
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,280
- I can see!
- You’re lying.

271
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:01,520
- What?
- Really?

272
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:04,680
- You have your sight?
- Yeah!

273
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,320
You’re kidding!

274
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,080
- You’re eyes!
- Nice to meet you.

275
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:11,280
- Oh, my God!
- He can see!

276
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:14,680
- I can’t believe it!
- He sees! He sees!

277
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,040
- I thought he was kidding!
- No.

278
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,800
- Hey, you guys!
- What this mean?

279
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,160
I can see everybody’s face!

280
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,520
- Oh, my gosh!
- I know. I can’t believe it!

281
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:30,520
I can see you. I love you guys!
You guys are so beautiful!

282
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,680
At that moment...

283
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,680
the same unspoken thought
occurred to everyone,

284
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,160
"He was the first to go blind.
Perhaps...

285
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,440
we will all regain
our sight in turn. "

286
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,000
So the celebration was
not entirely selfless.

287
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,000
The next days,
the next weeks...

288
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,320
would therefore be
sleepless with anticipation.

289
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,600
They would see again.

290
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,040
This time, they would really see.

291
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,040
But who would be so timid...

292
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,920
as to cling to this
blanket of blindness?

293
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,000
Who would be so
foolish as to fear...

294
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:17,480
that its intimacies might be lost?

295
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,760
And what of this woman...

296
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,600
who is now so strangely silent...

297
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:28,080
who has borne such a
terrible weight...

298
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,960
and is now so suddenly free?

299
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:37,200
Already she could imagine the
voices of the city, shouting,

300
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,680
"I can see!"

301
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,360
"I'm going blind", she thought.
