Hi. Ed Ramsey from Delos.

2
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:52,178
If there's anyone who doesn't know
what Delos is, well, as we've always said...

3
00:00:52,254 --> 00:00:54,983
...Delos is the vacation
of the future, today.

4
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:58,883
At Delos you get your choice
of the vacation you want.

5
00:00:59,326 --> 00:01:02,956
There's Medieval World, Roman World
and, of course, Westworld.

6
00:01:03,031 --> 00:01:05,056
Let's talk to some people
who've been there.

7
00:01:05,132 --> 00:01:06,531
Pardon me, sir. What is your name?

8
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,091
Gardner Lewis.
Just got back from Westworld.

9
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:10,704
Tell us how you liked it, Mr. Lewis.

10
00:01:10,773 --> 00:01:13,333
When you played cowboys and Indians
as a kid, you'd point...

11
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:15,968
...go "bang, bang" and the other kid
would lie down and play dead.

12
00:01:16,044 --> 00:01:19,445
Well, Westworld is the same thing, only...
only it's for real!

13
00:01:20,449 --> 00:01:24,545
I shot six people!
Well, they weren't real people!

14
00:01:24,786 --> 00:01:27,380
What Mr. Lewis means is
he shot six robots...

15
00:01:27,589 --> 00:01:31,788
...scientifically programmed to look, act,
talk and even bleed just like humans do.

16
00:01:31,862 --> 00:01:32,792
Isn't that right?

17
00:01:32,862 --> 00:01:36,161
Well, they may have been robots.
I mean, I think they were robots.

18
00:01:36,465 --> 00:01:39,093
I mean, I know they were robots!

19
00:01:39,302 --> 00:01:41,896
Yes, the robots of Westworld are there
to serve you...

20
00:01:41,971 --> 00:01:45,873
...and to give you the most unique
vacation experience of your life.

21
00:01:45,943 --> 00:01:47,000
Thank you, sir.

22
00:01:47,778 --> 00:01:49,369
And you, madam?

23
00:01:49,545 --> 00:01:50,569
Hello.

24
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,874
What is your name?

25
00:01:51,948 --> 00:01:55,213
My name is Janet Lane,
and I was in Roman World.

26
00:01:55,384 --> 00:01:58,445
What is the one thing that stands out
in your mind about Roman World?

27
00:01:58,522 --> 00:02:00,990
Oh, well, I think it would be...

28
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,490
...the men!

29
00:02:03,793 --> 00:02:05,921
I just feel marvelous! I mean...

30
00:02:05,996 --> 00:02:09,228
...it's just a warm,
glowing place to be!

31
00:02:09,601 --> 00:02:10,966
Thank you very much.

32
00:02:11,035 --> 00:02:13,763
Oh, thank you very much!

33
00:02:14,338 --> 00:02:15,306
Goodbye.

34
00:02:15,371 --> 00:02:16,430
Goodbye.

35
00:02:17,841 --> 00:02:18,830
And you, sir?

36
00:02:18,909 --> 00:02:19,773
Yeah?

37
00:02:19,843 --> 00:02:21,368
What is your name, sir?

38
00:02:21,445 --> 00:02:24,108
Oh, I'm Ted Mann.
I'm a stockbroker from St. Louis.

39
00:02:24,449 --> 00:02:26,815
And, which world did you
just come from, sir?

40
00:02:26,886 --> 00:02:28,785
Oh, you're not going to believe this!

41
00:02:28,853 --> 00:02:32,311
I've just been the sheriff of Westworld
for the last two weeks!

42
00:02:32,424 --> 00:02:34,288
Did it seem real to you, sir?

43
00:02:34,359 --> 00:02:36,828
It's the realest thing I've ever done!
I mean that!

44
00:02:36,896 --> 00:02:38,055
Thank you very much.

45
00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:38,925
Yeah.

46
00:02:40,231 --> 00:02:41,061
And you, sir?

47
00:02:41,132 --> 00:02:43,396
My name's Arthur Caine.
I've been in the castle.

48
00:02:43,468 --> 00:02:46,767
I've had a couple of sword fights
and three jousts.

49
00:02:47,472 --> 00:02:48,565
And I...

50
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,634
I married a beautiful princess.

51
00:02:51,877 --> 00:02:54,675
Is that something you've
always dreamed of doing, sir?

52
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,111
All my life!

53
00:02:58,584 --> 00:03:01,610
There were some of the comments
of people who've just returned from Delos.

54
00:03:01,688 --> 00:03:02,881
Why don't you arrange...

55
00:03:02,955 --> 00:03:07,289
...to take our Hovercraft to Medieval World,
Roman World and Westworld?

56
00:03:07,693 --> 00:03:09,457
Was it worth $1,000 a day?

57
00:03:09,561 --> 00:03:11,689
Yes!

58
00:03:12,164 --> 00:03:16,659
Contact us today, or see your travel agent.
Boy, have we got a vacation for you!

59
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:25,135
505. 345. 675. Delta 9.

60
00:03:25,446 --> 00:03:29,108
505. 345. 675. Delta 9.

61
00:03:44,632 --> 00:03:47,465
This is Delos Control to Station 3.

62
00:03:47,535 --> 00:03:51,903
You are cleared on Vector 79, on 195...

63
00:03:53,106 --> 00:03:56,304
We anticipate scanning
in about four and a half minutes.

64
00:04:12,795 --> 00:04:14,820
I'm not worried at all. I'm just...

65
00:04:15,832 --> 00:04:17,161
I'm just curious.

66
00:04:18,099 --> 00:04:20,000
How much do they weigh?

67
00:04:20,369 --> 00:04:21,859
Three or four pounds.

68
00:04:22,104 --> 00:04:23,401
That heavy.

69
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:27,703
Do they have much of a kick?

70
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:30,308
A Colt.45?

71
00:04:31,346 --> 00:04:33,474
Well, I never fired one before.

72
00:04:38,955 --> 00:04:42,014
What about that thing
where you go like this over the gun?

73
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:43,656
- Fanning?
- Yeah.

74
00:04:44,259 --> 00:04:46,353
- What about it?
- Is that hard to do?

75
00:04:51,468 --> 00:04:52,298
Now...

76
00:04:52,369 --> 00:04:56,168
The gunbelt, does it have those strings
to tie around your leg?

77
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,502
If that's the kind you want.

78
00:04:57,574 --> 00:05:01,567
That's the kind I want. I think it's
probably better for quick draws, you know.

79
00:05:04,181 --> 00:05:05,375
It all depends.

80
00:05:06,182 --> 00:05:08,879
What kind of gunbelt did you have
the last time?

81
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,988
I had the one without the strings.

82
00:05:14,091 --> 00:05:15,682
And you could draw fast?

83
00:05:18,629 --> 00:05:20,893
Then maybe it doesn't matter after all.

84
00:05:24,969 --> 00:05:27,199
The guns they give you are real guns?

85
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:29,632
Real guns.

86
00:05:30,841 --> 00:05:31,899
That's incredible.

87
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:35,205
Give us a shift to 197...

88
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,112
...and take it down to Port 43.

89
00:05:38,716 --> 00:05:41,116
Negative acceleration at 22.

90
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,945
So long as you maintain
passenger comfort.

91
00:05:45,423 --> 00:05:48,824
Sigma-sigma was transferred
according to the log at 041.

92
00:05:51,263 --> 00:05:54,096
The orientation on the resort
will now begin.

93
00:05:54,233 --> 00:05:56,257
Please put on your earphones.

94
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,304
Don't you want to listen?

95
00:06:00,438 --> 00:06:02,134
I heard it the last time.

96
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:06,845
...consists of three separate resort areas,
each with its own special appeal.

97
00:06:07,046 --> 00:06:08,603
Whichever resort you have chosen...

98
00:06:08,681 --> 00:06:12,082
...we are sure you will have
a fascinating and rewarding stay here.

99
00:06:12,452 --> 00:06:16,946
Western World is a complete re-creation
of the American frontier of 1880.

100
00:06:17,057 --> 00:06:21,516
Here it is possible to relive the excitement
and stresses of pioneer life to the fullest.

101
00:06:21,593 --> 00:06:26,191
Western World is a life of lawless violence,
a society of guns and action.

102
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,500
This is Medieval World, where we have
reconstructed 13th-century Europe.

103
00:06:31,805 --> 00:06:35,400
A world of chivalry and combat,
romance and excitement.

104
00:06:35,842 --> 00:06:39,243
Our teams of engineers have spared
no expense in this re-creation...

105
00:06:39,313 --> 00:06:41,645
...precise to the smallest detail.

106
00:06:41,883 --> 00:06:43,373
Then we have Roman World:

107
00:06:43,618 --> 00:06:47,748
A lusty treat for the senses in the setting
of delightful, decadent Pompeii.

108
00:06:47,988 --> 00:06:52,288
Here the traveler experiences the sensual,
relaxed morality that existed at the peak...

109
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,294
...of the Imperial Roman Empire.

110
00:06:54,428 --> 00:06:56,988
All together,
these resorts comprise Delos...

111
00:06:57,098 --> 00:06:59,965
...the most exciting vacation spot
in the history of man.

112
00:07:00,234 --> 00:07:02,964
This is Delos Control to Station 3.

113
00:07:03,037 --> 00:07:05,700
Your negative deceleration
should be 25...

114
00:07:05,774 --> 00:07:09,367
...and your ground speed should be
355 and dropping.

115
00:07:09,877 --> 00:07:12,869
The whole spectrum of technology
has been employed in Delos...

116
00:07:13,014 --> 00:07:14,346
...for the vacationer's pleasure.

117
00:07:14,415 --> 00:07:17,442
Expensive and unusual,
Delos is not for everyone.

118
00:07:17,518 --> 00:07:21,784
But for those who choose it, it is truly
a unique and rewarding experience.

119
00:07:32,936 --> 00:07:35,403
We have you on Grid 5.

120
00:07:35,704 --> 00:07:37,035
Notify ground crews.

121
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,914
Stand by. Locking in now.

122
00:07:49,752 --> 00:07:52,516
Shut down 2, shut down 3.

123
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:55,924
Shut down 2, shut down 3.

124
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,755
Nice job, everybody.

125
00:08:22,354 --> 00:08:23,819
Welcome to Delos.

126
00:08:25,488 --> 00:08:27,548
Please go to your color-coded tram...

127
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:30,595
...which will take you
to the world of your choice.

128
00:08:30,894 --> 00:08:33,193
Give your name to the attendant.

129
00:08:35,233 --> 00:08:36,722
Welcome to Delos.

130
00:08:37,335 --> 00:08:39,394
Please go to your color-coded tram...

131
00:08:39,504 --> 00:08:41,869
...which will take you
to the world of your choice.

132
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,101
May I have your name, please?

133
00:08:43,174 --> 00:08:44,072
John Blane.

134
00:08:44,142 --> 00:08:45,541
- Peter Martin.
- Thank you.

135
00:08:46,545 --> 00:08:49,342
Please go to your color-coded tram
which will take you...

136
00:08:49,447 --> 00:08:51,312
...to the world of your choice.

137
00:08:53,885 --> 00:08:56,080
We are sure you will enjoy your stay
in Western World.

138
00:08:56,154 --> 00:08:57,348
Was she a...?

139
00:08:57,523 --> 00:08:58,784
Probably.

140
00:08:59,491 --> 00:09:00,618
That's amazing!

141
00:09:02,361 --> 00:09:05,989
Supposedly, you really can't tell...
except by looking at the hands.

142
00:09:08,402 --> 00:09:09,959
They haven't perfected the hands yet.

143
00:09:10,036 --> 00:09:11,560
Nothing can go wrong.

144
00:09:11,737 --> 00:09:14,204
You will enjoy your stay
in Roman World.

145
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:18,308
While you are there, please feel free
to indulge your every whim.

146
00:09:18,944 --> 00:09:21,845
Medieval World exists for you, the guest.

147
00:09:22,481 --> 00:09:24,039
Nothing can go wrong.

148
00:10:22,745 --> 00:10:26,909
I have a quick fade on the CRT and my
balance controls don't seem to help me.

149
00:10:27,348 --> 00:10:28,838
I'm keeping this in real time.

150
00:10:28,917 --> 00:10:31,909
Switch me over to an on-line status
and I'll do it manually.

151
00:10:32,388 --> 00:10:35,550
You've got a three-millisecond cycle delay
which should be computed in.

152
00:10:35,624 --> 00:10:38,149
I don't know what to do
if the stagecoach is late.

153
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:19,093
Oh! It's fantastic!

154
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,488
I reckon that's everything.

155
00:11:43,127 --> 00:11:44,686
Bath's down the hall.

156
00:11:45,229 --> 00:11:47,721
Bath'll cost you
two bits for hot water.

157
00:11:48,766 --> 00:11:51,134
Dinner at 7:00, breakfast at 6:30.

158
00:11:51,436 --> 00:11:53,131
Get lunch on your own.

159
00:11:53,206 --> 00:11:54,901
Couple of places in town to eat.

160
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:58,532
Don't look like much here,
but we have everything.

161
00:11:58,811 --> 00:11:59,970
Just a minute.

162
00:12:11,723 --> 00:12:13,453
You mean to tell me he's a robot?

163
00:12:13,526 --> 00:12:15,391
That's what I mean to tell you.

164
00:12:20,466 --> 00:12:22,730
We're paying $1,000 a day for this?

165
00:12:23,269 --> 00:12:24,463
It's authentic.

166
00:12:25,338 --> 00:12:27,102
The West of the 1880s.

167
00:12:29,141 --> 00:12:32,304
Well, at least they could've made it
a little more comfortable.

168
00:12:33,179 --> 00:12:34,545
But that's the point.

169
00:12:35,214 --> 00:12:36,909
This is really the way it was.

170
00:12:38,518 --> 00:12:41,420
If you wanted comfort,
you should have stayed in Chicago.

171
00:12:42,155 --> 00:12:44,020
Julie would have loved all this!

172
00:12:44,258 --> 00:12:47,854
Poking around for hours
in all those funny shops, looking for silly...

173
00:12:47,929 --> 00:12:49,327
What the hell is wrong with you?

174
00:12:49,396 --> 00:12:50,863
You're a lawyer!

175
00:12:51,032 --> 00:12:54,058
You know better than anybody else
what a ride she took you for.

176
00:12:54,135 --> 00:12:55,499
Well, the kids...

177
00:12:56,203 --> 00:12:57,364
Fine, the kids!

178
00:12:57,704 --> 00:13:00,173
But you're here, six months later,
still thinking about her.

179
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,708
No, not really.
She just came to mind, is all.

180
00:13:10,818 --> 00:13:12,410
There's a lot to do here.

181
00:14:16,652 --> 00:14:18,212
- What'll it be?
- Whiskey.

182
00:14:19,055 --> 00:14:20,387
What about you?

183
00:14:20,491 --> 00:14:23,858
Vodka martini on the rocks
with a twist of lemon. Very dry, please.

184
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:27,024
Just give him whiskey.
He's new in town.

185
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:34,337
You've got to get
into the feel of the thing.

186
00:14:34,404 --> 00:14:35,598
I feel silly.

187
00:14:36,073 --> 00:14:37,199
Why?

188
00:14:38,576 --> 00:14:39,975
It's like a joke.

189
00:14:40,978 --> 00:14:45,506
It's not a joke, it's an amusement park.
It's the best amusement park in the world.

190
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:48,082
All you have to do is have fun.

191
00:14:50,287 --> 00:14:52,847
There's some pretty
rough-looking customers here.

192
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:54,322
How many of them are...?

193
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:55,655
Guests like us?

194
00:14:55,962 --> 00:14:56,950
Who knows?

195
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:59,623
That's the beauty of this place.
It doesn't matter.

196
00:15:00,465 --> 00:15:03,127
It may look rough,
but it's still just a resort.

197
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:22,416
There's no way to get hurt here.
Just enjoy yourself.

198
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:34,264
What is this stuff?

199
00:15:36,136 --> 00:15:37,330
It doesn't say.

200
00:15:37,971 --> 00:15:40,235
God! Give me this!

201
00:15:40,441 --> 00:15:42,033
Puts hair on your chest.

202
00:15:42,576 --> 00:15:43,634
Yeah.

203
00:16:07,035 --> 00:16:08,558
Sloppy with your drink.

204
00:16:19,648 --> 00:16:21,137
Get this boy a bib.

205
00:16:25,352 --> 00:16:26,411
Go on!

206
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:35,561
He needs his momma.

207
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:39,198
Kill him.

208
00:16:47,042 --> 00:16:48,407
You talk too much.

209
00:16:54,918 --> 00:16:56,476
You say something, boy?

210
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:04,114
I said, you talk too much.

211
00:17:12,668 --> 00:17:14,364
Why don't you make me shut up?

212
00:17:38,929 --> 00:17:40,022
Your move.

213
00:18:29,781 --> 00:18:31,113
Pretty realistic, huh?

214
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:33,712
Listen, are you sure he was a...?

215
00:18:34,287 --> 00:18:37,257
Of course. You don't really think
you shot anybody, do you?

216
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,627
Wow!

217
00:18:44,264 --> 00:18:45,458
Hey, John...

218
00:18:45,865 --> 00:18:49,029
How do I know I'm not going to kill
another guest with this thing?

219
00:18:52,406 --> 00:18:53,464
Try it.

220
00:18:56,744 --> 00:18:57,904
Shoot me.

221
00:19:00,582 --> 00:19:01,776
Go on, shoot.

222
00:19:08,555 --> 00:19:09,545
Shoot!

223
00:19:13,061 --> 00:19:14,994
The gun has a sensing device.

224
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:18,323
It won't fire at anything
with a high body temperature.

225
00:19:18,766 --> 00:19:20,666
Only something cold, like a machine.

226
00:19:23,071 --> 00:19:24,663
They thought of everything.

227
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:30,777
The Black Knight won't be repaired
till tomorrow afternoon.

228
00:19:35,283 --> 00:19:38,684
Yeah, I have the banquet scheduled
for 5:30, if that conforms.

229
00:20:26,903 --> 00:20:29,929
What do folks do for companionly
entertainment in this town?

230
00:20:30,475 --> 00:20:33,774
I wouldn't know about such things.
I'm just runnin' this hotel.

231
00:20:33,978 --> 00:20:37,105
Miss Carrie has a real nice saloon
down at the end of the street.

232
00:20:37,215 --> 00:20:39,683
Now, I won't have talk of that woman
in this house.

233
00:20:39,817 --> 00:20:41,342
Not over my dinner.

234
00:20:42,285 --> 00:20:43,914
The food's real good, ma'am.

235
00:20:44,188 --> 00:20:47,385
Thank you, stranger.
You're a gentleman of some breedin'.

236
00:20:47,925 --> 00:20:49,687
Isn't she terrific?

237
00:20:51,496 --> 00:20:52,588
Who's Miss Carrie?

238
00:21:41,247 --> 00:21:42,839
You fellas new in town?

239
00:21:44,584 --> 00:21:45,573
Yep.

240
00:21:46,419 --> 00:21:47,409
Whiskey.

241
00:21:48,189 --> 00:21:49,554
Just passin' through?

242
00:21:51,324 --> 00:21:52,349
Maybe.

243
00:21:52,926 --> 00:21:54,326
Lookin' for some fun?

244
00:21:57,197 --> 00:21:58,222
Maybe.

245
00:21:59,133 --> 00:22:02,329
Well, you've come to the right place.
There's plenty of fun here.

246
00:22:03,704 --> 00:22:05,934
That's Cindy and Arlette.

247
00:22:07,342 --> 00:22:08,808
Arlette's from Paris.

248
00:22:10,544 --> 00:22:13,069
Perhaps you gentlemen
are taking a likin' to 'em.

249
00:22:13,514 --> 00:22:14,504
Perhaps.

250
00:22:14,649 --> 00:22:16,344
They're real accommodatin'.

251
00:22:19,454 --> 00:22:20,978
- They look it.
- Listen...

252
00:22:21,056 --> 00:22:24,491
Why don't you just go on upstairs
and we'll reckon accounts later?

253
00:22:25,493 --> 00:22:28,257
- Sounds good to me.
- Are those two girls machines?

254
00:22:30,532 --> 00:22:32,625
Now, how can you say a thing like that?

255
00:22:34,202 --> 00:22:35,227
Come on.

256
00:22:48,318 --> 00:22:49,442
What's goin' on?

257
00:22:51,621 --> 00:22:53,110
They're robbin' the bank.

258
00:22:53,389 --> 00:22:54,686
Robbin' the bank?

259
00:22:54,924 --> 00:22:56,983
Hey, maybe we oughta go help out.

260
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:00,493
You don't know.
It might be fun to play bank robbers.

261
00:23:00,563 --> 00:23:03,192
Look, Pete, this is better.

262
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:49,807
There...

263
00:23:51,382 --> 00:23:54,647
There is something I have to tell you.
I don't know if it matters...

264
00:23:55,954 --> 00:23:57,479
...but it matters to me.

265
00:24:05,263 --> 00:24:07,424
I haven't ever had a...

266
00:24:11,469 --> 00:24:14,804
Well, I hardly know you,
if you know what I mean. I mean...

267
00:24:15,608 --> 00:24:17,803
We just met a few minutes ago.

268
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,505
You're probably very nice.

269
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:44,564
I feel funny.

270
00:24:48,942 --> 00:24:49,932
Why?

271
00:25:43,865 --> 00:25:45,661
I think you're very nice.

272
00:25:55,644 --> 00:25:58,341
How was it? Wasn't it terrific?

273
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:01,279
Boy, machines are the servant of man!

274
00:26:01,884 --> 00:26:03,215
Wasn't that great?

275
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:04,981
Not bad.

276
00:26:05,356 --> 00:26:08,255
Not bad. Now you're the big lover!

277
00:26:10,692 --> 00:26:12,387
Well, you know how it is.

278
00:26:12,795 --> 00:26:14,592
Some guys have a way with women.

279
00:26:16,699 --> 00:26:17,996
Shooting stopped.

280
00:26:20,169 --> 00:26:22,034
I guess we missed the robbery.

281
00:26:24,141 --> 00:26:25,609
You can't have everything.

282
00:26:29,313 --> 00:26:30,507
John...

283
00:26:31,781 --> 00:26:33,612
...this place is really fun!

284
00:30:16,349 --> 00:30:18,213
I think it's the jugular unit.

285
00:30:25,325 --> 00:30:28,157
- What do you think?
- Should we try and rewire her?

286
00:30:28,227 --> 00:30:31,128
No, I'd replace the whole unit
rather than try and repair it.

287
00:30:31,198 --> 00:30:32,187
With a 10?

288
00:30:32,532 --> 00:30:35,831
Use an XX-50 if we have any in stock.
The double X's have a longer lifespan.

289
00:30:35,901 --> 00:30:37,665
A 50 may not fit in here.

290
00:30:38,437 --> 00:30:41,838
Maybe you can shift the integrator unit
further up into the cavity.

291
00:30:42,475 --> 00:30:43,567
I'll try it.

292
00:30:49,383 --> 00:30:50,816
Balance servo again?

293
00:30:50,916 --> 00:30:53,408
Yeah, she fell over this afternoon.

294
00:30:54,122 --> 00:30:55,679
I think it's the sensor.

295
00:30:56,691 --> 00:30:58,453
If it's the central unit
we'll open her up.

296
00:30:58,525 --> 00:31:00,789
You get a confirmation
before you do that.

297
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:06,827
What's he in for?

298
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,231
Central malfunction.

299
00:31:09,436 --> 00:31:10,596
Another one?

300
00:31:27,522 --> 00:31:30,456
Since we opened the resort,
we had a failure and breakdown rate...

301
00:31:30,525 --> 00:31:32,517
...conforming to computer predictions.

302
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:37,290
That is 0.3 malfunctions
for each 24-hour activation period...

303
00:31:37,433 --> 00:31:38,627
...concurrent or not.

304
00:31:38,901 --> 00:31:42,166
Now, this was an anticipated operations
aspect of the resort...

305
00:31:42,271 --> 00:31:44,137
...and we were fully able to handle it.

306
00:31:44,205 --> 00:31:48,108
The majority of the breakdowns
were minor or peripheral...

307
00:31:48,577 --> 00:31:50,136
...until about six weeks ago.

308
00:31:50,446 --> 00:31:53,540
Then Roman World had a rise
in breakdown rate...

309
00:31:53,614 --> 00:31:55,207
...which doubled in a week.

310
00:31:55,517 --> 00:31:57,712
In addition,
we saw a disproportionate rise...

311
00:31:57,786 --> 00:32:00,619
...in central as opposed to
peripheral breakdowns.

312
00:32:01,123 --> 00:32:04,422
Now, we identified some problems
with humidity control...

313
00:32:04,761 --> 00:32:06,695
...and regained homeostasis.

314
00:32:06,995 --> 00:32:10,329
Despite our corrections,
the breakdown rate continued to climb.

315
00:32:10,633 --> 00:32:12,828
Then Medieval World began
to have trouble.

316
00:32:13,337 --> 00:32:15,862
Now we're seeing
more Western World breakdowns.

317
00:32:16,273 --> 00:32:19,570
And there's a clear pattern here
which suggests an analogy...

318
00:32:19,676 --> 00:32:23,703
...to an infectious disease process
spreading from one resort area to the next.

319
00:32:24,114 --> 00:32:27,515
Perhaps there are
superficial similarities to disease.

320
00:32:27,685 --> 00:32:31,781
It's only a theoretical concept.
There are many ways to order that data.

321
00:32:32,089 --> 00:32:34,888
I must confess,
I find it difficult to believe in...

322
00:32:34,958 --> 00:32:36,824
...a disease of machinery.

323
00:32:37,394 --> 00:32:39,419
We aren't dealing
with ordinary machines here.

324
00:32:39,497 --> 00:32:42,488
These are highly complicated
pieces of equipment...

325
00:32:42,899 --> 00:32:45,391
...almost as complicated
as living organisms.

326
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:48,805
In some cases, they've been designed
by other computers.

327
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,499
We don't know exactly how they work.

328
00:33:01,185 --> 00:33:03,586
Okay, up gain 437...

329
00:33:03,689 --> 00:33:06,486
I'm not getting sound pickup
from the tenth quadrant.

330
00:33:08,393 --> 00:33:10,418
Okay, my telemetry is good.

331
00:33:10,997 --> 00:33:13,430
Repeat, I have good telemetry.

332
00:33:14,599 --> 00:33:17,193
We have sunrise at 0.43.

333
00:33:17,803 --> 00:33:19,361
Ready on all quadrants.

334
00:33:19,504 --> 00:33:20,698
Energize grid.

335
00:33:21,607 --> 00:33:23,097
Grid energized.

336
00:33:25,646 --> 00:33:28,876
All right, then give me a 436,
if you can patch that in.

337
00:33:28,948 --> 00:33:30,973
If not, 435.

338
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:34,147
I have sound now. Thank you very much.

339
00:33:34,886 --> 00:33:37,878
Yes, I want scrambled eggs and bacon
and cinnamon toast.

340
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:40,719
Do you have cinnamon toast? You do?

341
00:33:40,859 --> 00:33:43,988
Okay, send it down
to Central Control Room, Console 3.

342
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:45,222
Wait a minute.

343
00:33:45,332 --> 00:33:47,493
What was that? No grounding on Unit 5?

344
00:33:48,134 --> 00:33:51,764
Try a bypass.
I have readings on all units, 5 included.

345
00:33:52,406 --> 00:33:53,634
Hold on a minute.

346
00:33:54,208 --> 00:33:57,371
All right, let's stand by
for resort activation.

347
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:06,885
You ready on Phase 443?

348
00:34:09,591 --> 00:34:11,149
443.

349
00:34:12,826 --> 00:34:15,193
Okay, we're going to activate at 59...

350
00:34:18,066 --> 00:34:19,590
Lower gain Alpha 2...

351
00:34:23,837 --> 00:34:26,773
Ready on six, on five, on four...

352
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:30,504
...on three, on two. Activate now.

353
00:35:16,392 --> 00:35:19,487
"Oh, give me a home

354
00:35:20,163 --> 00:35:23,257
"Where the buffalo roam

355
00:35:23,934 --> 00:35:28,064
"And the deer and the antelope play

356
00:35:29,272 --> 00:35:31,832
"Where seldom is heard

357
00:35:32,076 --> 00:35:35,306
"A discouraging word

358
00:35:36,179 --> 00:35:41,049
"And the skies are not cloudy all day"

359
00:36:07,611 --> 00:36:08,772
What do you want?

360
00:36:09,548 --> 00:36:13,143
"Home, home on the range"

361
00:36:17,622 --> 00:36:18,884
Not one word.

362
00:36:19,859 --> 00:36:21,554
Do you mind if I finish shaving?

363
00:36:29,301 --> 00:36:30,791
Have you no sense of...

364
00:37:14,915 --> 00:37:16,246
Was he bothering you?

365
00:37:18,117 --> 00:37:19,881
He isn't gonna bother you again.

366
00:37:19,953 --> 00:37:21,614
I'm here to tell you
that things have changed.

367
00:37:22,022 --> 00:37:23,455
There's law here now.

368
00:37:23,558 --> 00:37:26,049
You can't go around plugging
whoever you please.

369
00:37:27,962 --> 00:37:29,826
But, Sheriff, it was self-defense.

370
00:37:30,132 --> 00:37:31,792
That's what they all say.

371
00:37:31,932 --> 00:37:34,697
He shot a man.
He'll have to stand trial.

372
00:37:35,036 --> 00:37:36,504
Judge'll be here next week.

373
00:37:37,172 --> 00:37:39,936
If I were you,
I wouldn't trouble over your friend here.

374
00:37:40,009 --> 00:37:41,737
Judge Benson likes to hang 'em.

375
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:43,434
Hang 'em high.

376
00:37:43,545 --> 00:37:44,705
Look, Sheriff...

377
00:37:44,813 --> 00:37:45,802
Beat it.

378
00:37:48,217 --> 00:37:49,547
I said, beat it!

379
00:38:09,405 --> 00:38:11,305
I've never been in jail before.

380
00:38:13,242 --> 00:38:14,642
First time for everything.

381
00:38:18,548 --> 00:38:20,413
But I haven't done anything wrong.

382
00:38:21,318 --> 00:38:23,548
You shot a man. That's something.

383
00:38:24,988 --> 00:38:26,979
- Where are you from?
- Chicago.

384
00:38:28,858 --> 00:38:31,259
Well, Chicago's a long
way from here, fella.

385
00:38:32,995 --> 00:38:35,089
A thousand miles and more.

386
00:41:04,052 --> 00:41:05,077
Hold it!

387
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:36,151
I guess that sort of
makes us desperados.

388
00:41:36,353 --> 00:41:37,684
Yeah, I guess.

389
00:41:40,191 --> 00:41:42,682
Well, what do we do now?

390
00:41:42,993 --> 00:41:45,155
The way I figure it, anything we want.

391
00:41:45,862 --> 00:41:48,160
- There's no law in that town now.
- I'll say.

392
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,093
We go in there,
and we do anything we want!

393
00:41:54,172 --> 00:41:55,469
You know what?

394
00:41:56,407 --> 00:41:57,397
What?

395
00:41:57,675 --> 00:41:59,643
I almost believe all this.

396
00:42:00,346 --> 00:42:01,937
Why shouldn't you believe it?

397
00:42:02,313 --> 00:42:03,975
It's as real as anything else.

398
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:05,638
Yep.

399
00:42:05,851 --> 00:42:07,079
I reckon.

400
00:42:07,553 --> 00:42:09,111
What can you give me in Grid 7?

401
00:42:09,188 --> 00:42:11,588
We have that on SM-514.

402
00:42:12,323 --> 00:42:14,222
Transfer, now.

403
00:42:16,328 --> 00:42:17,453
Transferred.

404
00:42:17,963 --> 00:42:19,190
Reschedule.

405
00:42:19,264 --> 00:42:22,130
She wants to meet the king.
We have to restructure for that.

406
00:42:22,201 --> 00:42:23,326
Can't disappoint a guest.

407
00:42:23,402 --> 00:42:27,338
Yeah, listen, this is the third day in a row
that I've called you about my laundry.

408
00:42:27,406 --> 00:42:28,703
You've got all my shirts...

409
00:42:28,775 --> 00:42:31,369
We're rechecking the tapes
on the mechanism now.

410
00:42:32,312 --> 00:42:34,644
We have programmed infidelity
in the queen...

411
00:42:34,714 --> 00:42:37,307
...as of two minutes ago.

412
00:42:37,850 --> 00:42:41,218
All right,
coming up on the castle, zero...

413
00:42:42,155 --> 00:42:42,848
Now.

414
00:42:42,989 --> 00:42:45,957
It also conforms with your five-year history
at this time of the year.

415
00:42:50,296 --> 00:42:51,490
Leave me now.

416
00:43:07,247 --> 00:43:08,373
My queen!

417
00:43:14,522 --> 00:43:17,650
If the king should hear of this,
we would both be put to death!

418
00:43:18,292 --> 00:43:21,284
I would be more than happy
to die for you, my lady.

419
00:43:21,796 --> 00:43:24,027
Let us pray it shall not be so.

420
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:26,896
I have news.

421
00:43:27,901 --> 00:43:30,871
The Black Knight has returned,
and seeks a match with you.

422
00:43:32,373 --> 00:43:33,601
The Black Knight...?

423
00:43:33,675 --> 00:43:34,834
None other.

424
00:43:35,777 --> 00:43:37,210
Is he pretty tough?

425
00:43:37,979 --> 00:43:41,073
He has the strength of ten,
and cunning besides.

426
00:43:42,884 --> 00:43:43,873
But...

427
00:43:44,352 --> 00:43:46,411
...his sight is weak in his left eye.

428
00:43:46,656 --> 00:43:49,284
Stay to his left and you will prevail
and win the day.

429
00:43:49,791 --> 00:43:53,022
Confirmation of the reprogramming
of that Black Knight...

430
00:43:53,128 --> 00:43:56,256
...for left lateral weakness and instability
for tomorrow.

431
00:43:56,697 --> 00:43:58,427
I shall see you on the morrow?

432
00:43:59,134 --> 00:44:00,158
My lady.

433
00:44:30,067 --> 00:44:33,230
Schedule for tomorrow a.m.
It's his last day in the resort.

434
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:34,895
Let's make it a lulu.

435
00:44:35,939 --> 00:44:38,601
Tomorrow a.m. Broadswords.
Schedule locked.

436
00:44:39,209 --> 00:44:41,643
We have a problem
with the air conditioning in Beta section.

437
00:44:41,712 --> 00:44:43,078
Send a crew out.

438
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:46,005
Yes! He can be sheriff
any time he wants.

439
00:44:46,115 --> 00:44:48,311
That is correct.
Just give him the badge.

440
00:45:01,065 --> 00:45:03,261
Now, I'm the new law around here.

441
00:45:05,135 --> 00:45:07,070
You think you can handle things?

442
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:12,002
You wanna try me?

443
00:45:40,372 --> 00:45:41,897
A thousand pardons, my lord.

444
00:45:44,844 --> 00:45:46,641
What is your name, child?

445
00:45:47,781 --> 00:45:48,770
Daphne.

446
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:51,107
Daphne.

447
00:45:53,719 --> 00:45:55,347
Oh, I love this place.

448
00:45:56,089 --> 00:45:57,454
I love my horse.

449
00:45:57,690 --> 00:45:59,351
I love my horse and I love Julie.

450
00:45:59,425 --> 00:46:00,791
Oh, shut up, will you?

451
00:46:01,828 --> 00:46:03,692
I like the spots on my horse.

452
00:46:04,063 --> 00:46:06,556
- Did you see the spots on my horse?
- Your horse is beautiful.

453
00:46:06,632 --> 00:46:09,535
- Thank you very much. I like yours, too.
- Thank you.

454
00:46:11,004 --> 00:46:11,994
Look out!

455
00:46:12,573 --> 00:46:13,767
Let me handle this!

456
00:46:37,799 --> 00:46:39,096
Goddamn it!

457
00:46:39,433 --> 00:46:41,732
- Do you suppose it's real?
- Hell, no!

458
00:46:43,304 --> 00:46:44,794
That's not supposed to happen!

459
00:46:44,873 --> 00:46:47,170
Maybe it is!
Maybe it's part of the thing!

460
00:46:47,541 --> 00:46:51,478
The hell! Goddamn machines, anyway!
That's not supposed to happen!

461
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:54,673
A rattlesnake struck a guest?

462
00:46:54,783 --> 00:46:56,512
He was shooting at it and he missed.

463
00:46:56,585 --> 00:46:58,917
The snakes are programmed
never to hit on a strike.

464
00:46:58,987 --> 00:47:01,319
- Was the guest injured?
- Minor puncture wounds.

465
00:47:01,457 --> 00:47:03,447
It's inexcusable to injure a guest.

466
00:47:04,326 --> 00:47:06,157
Pick up that snake
for a total post at once.

467
00:47:06,229 --> 00:47:09,857
Check all the snake's central mechanisms
tonight during the repair period.

468
00:47:17,239 --> 00:47:19,470
Doesn't anything work around here?

469
00:48:36,222 --> 00:48:39,020
Logic circuits on the snake
simply failed to respond.

470
00:48:39,125 --> 00:48:41,923
There was no sign
of mechanical damage or tampering...

471
00:48:41,994 --> 00:48:43,894
...and no clue to the malfunction.

472
00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:46,028
Central mechanism psychosis?

473
00:48:46,233 --> 00:48:48,461
I feel we should shut down
the resort for a month.

474
00:48:48,533 --> 00:48:49,967
Oh, that seems rash.

475
00:48:50,069 --> 00:48:53,163
A snake injured a guest.
We can't allow that to happen.

476
00:48:53,372 --> 00:48:56,001
Many elements of the Delos Resort
are potentially dangerous.

477
00:48:56,076 --> 00:48:58,442
That's part of the appeal.
But if they become truly dangerous...

478
00:48:58,511 --> 00:48:59,501
I agree.

479
00:49:00,347 --> 00:49:02,644
We can announce
that the resort is overbooked...

480
00:49:02,716 --> 00:49:05,583
...and not allow any further
new guests to arrive.

481
00:49:05,752 --> 00:49:07,879
We can take care of
the ones already here.

482
00:49:07,955 --> 00:49:11,481
If we can't insure the safety of the guests,
we'll be in desperate trouble.

483
00:49:11,558 --> 00:49:14,720
But we can insure their safety.
Everything's fine.

484
00:50:00,474 --> 00:50:03,603
All right, let's start that bar fight.

485
00:50:03,946 --> 00:50:04,913
Cheat!

486
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:13,781
John, what do you say?

487
00:50:14,591 --> 00:50:15,717
Hit me.

488
00:50:35,612 --> 00:50:37,103
Now, that's just rude!

489
00:51:31,037 --> 00:51:32,970
Hey, Sheriff! Come on!

490
00:53:07,202 --> 00:53:08,692
What's his problem?

491
00:53:08,837 --> 00:53:11,829
Nothing. He got shot up today,
so we're taking the opportunity...

492
00:53:11,907 --> 00:53:14,376
...to replace the visual cortex.

493
00:53:14,544 --> 00:53:16,535
Using the new infrared units.

494
00:53:17,113 --> 00:53:19,171
And we're increasing audio sensitivity.

495
00:53:24,154 --> 00:53:25,677
You called for me, my lord?

496
00:53:25,855 --> 00:53:26,844
Yes.

497
00:53:28,825 --> 00:53:31,293
How long have you been
in the palace, Daphne?

498
00:53:31,861 --> 00:53:33,590
Since I was three, my lord.

499
00:53:34,831 --> 00:53:35,991
Charming.

500
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,299
I think we ought to get
to know each other better, Daphne.

501
00:53:40,738 --> 00:53:42,137
Better, my lord?

502
00:53:43,473 --> 00:53:45,804
I can reward you well.

503
00:53:48,878 --> 00:53:50,039
My lord...

504
00:53:50,514 --> 00:53:51,708
Daphne...

505
00:53:53,084 --> 00:53:54,382
My lord!

506
00:53:54,752 --> 00:53:55,912
Daphne...

507
00:53:58,288 --> 00:54:00,417
My lord forgets himself!

508
00:54:02,259 --> 00:54:04,694
Problem with the girl.
Program breakdown.

509
00:54:05,630 --> 00:54:06,824
What's the trouble?

510
00:54:06,965 --> 00:54:09,194
One of the castle machines
isn't responding.

511
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:11,393
Refusing a guest seduction.

512
00:54:11,569 --> 00:54:13,799
Get her out of there,
and report it to central repair.

513
00:54:13,871 --> 00:54:14,998
Right.

514
00:54:15,774 --> 00:54:17,298
Refusing...?

515
00:54:35,494 --> 00:54:37,792
- Did you find the trouble?
- No apparent trouble.

516
00:54:37,864 --> 00:54:39,991
But she wasn't following programming.

517
00:54:40,132 --> 00:54:42,693
She refused a guest seduction
and she is a sex model.

518
00:54:42,934 --> 00:54:44,300
Certainly is.

519
00:54:44,737 --> 00:54:45,863
Will they shut down?

520
00:54:45,938 --> 00:54:49,704
No, the directors feel that to close down
now would hurt tourist confidence.

521
00:54:50,810 --> 00:54:52,243
I don't like it.

522
00:54:59,484 --> 00:55:00,577
Breakfast.

523
00:55:20,073 --> 00:55:22,337
I'm never gonna drink again.

524
00:55:49,002 --> 00:55:50,868
Okay, 437...

525
00:55:51,172 --> 00:55:53,538
I'm not getting sound pickup
in the tenth quadrant.

526
00:55:53,609 --> 00:55:55,576
Please set numbers to console...

527
00:56:14,663 --> 00:56:15,960
Hold, varlet!

528
00:56:26,643 --> 00:56:28,166
Are you speaking to me?

529
00:56:28,278 --> 00:56:29,939
None other, sire.

530
00:56:31,214 --> 00:56:33,375
Look, I'm hungry and l...

531
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:39,711
Prepare for thy doom,
thy scurrilous knave! Huh!

532
00:56:39,856 --> 00:56:42,449
Wait a minute! Can't we talk this over?

533
00:56:42,592 --> 00:56:44,422
What, have you no spine, varlet?

534
00:56:45,328 --> 00:56:46,488
Well, I...

535
00:56:48,031 --> 00:56:49,259
The queen!

536
00:56:53,638 --> 00:56:54,763
Full monitor.

537
00:56:58,309 --> 00:56:59,299
Okay.

538
00:57:01,244 --> 00:57:02,269
Let him go.

539
00:58:02,176 --> 00:58:05,008
Oh, what a hangover.

540
00:58:26,467 --> 00:58:27,866
All right, varlet!

541
00:58:33,507 --> 00:58:35,476
We're losing a little tolerance.
Bring me up.

542
00:59:07,742 --> 00:59:09,869
Shut down! Shut down immediately!

543
00:59:15,317 --> 00:59:16,841
Circuits don't respond, sir!

544
00:59:17,652 --> 00:59:19,052
Then cut the robot power!

545
00:59:19,121 --> 00:59:19,985
Power cut!

546
00:59:22,092 --> 00:59:23,423
Oh, my head!

547
00:59:30,065 --> 00:59:31,328
I'm freezing!

548
00:59:37,072 --> 00:59:38,733
Gotta get to the hotel.

549
00:59:41,343 --> 00:59:42,971
I think I'm gonna be sick.

550
00:59:54,558 --> 00:59:57,618
- They're not responding!
- Shall we cut the main power grid, sir?

551
00:59:57,693 --> 00:59:59,628
Shut it all down! Shut it all down!

552
01:00:10,708 --> 01:00:11,766
Hold it!

553
01:00:18,015 --> 01:00:19,642
Come on, not now.

554
01:00:20,184 --> 01:00:21,481
Not you again.

555
01:00:22,353 --> 01:00:23,615
It's too early.

556
01:00:26,625 --> 01:00:27,990
Let me do it this time.

557
01:00:31,763 --> 01:00:32,889
Your move.

558
01:00:44,542 --> 01:00:45,805
I'm shot.

559
01:00:46,245 --> 01:00:47,234
What?

560
01:00:48,113 --> 01:00:49,341
I'm shot!

561
01:01:00,093 --> 01:01:01,185
John...?

562
01:01:13,973 --> 01:01:15,167
Oh, my God!

563
01:01:18,311 --> 01:01:19,301
Draw.

564
01:01:30,357 --> 01:01:32,723
Sir, we have no control
over the robots at all!

565
01:02:43,233 --> 01:02:46,430
- They're running on stored charge!
- How long can they go?

566
01:02:46,703 --> 01:02:50,070
Some will begin to run down in an hour.
Others can go a full 12!

567
01:03:03,755 --> 01:03:06,781
- Turn the main grid back on!
- The relays must be frozen.

568
01:03:07,091 --> 01:03:08,786
We can't get back our power!

569
01:03:08,859 --> 01:03:10,225
Hello? Hello?

570
01:03:53,006 --> 01:03:56,874
Now, how are we going to get out of here?
All these doors are electrically powered.

571
01:03:58,878 --> 01:04:01,744
Now, get these doors open in here
before we all suffocate!

572
01:07:14,015 --> 01:07:16,346
Temperature elevated, 98 degrees.

573
01:07:16,650 --> 01:07:19,743
Oxygen, 17 percent and dropping.

574
01:07:20,253 --> 01:07:22,585
Get that power on
so we can open these doors.

575
01:07:57,725 --> 01:07:58,750
Hey!

576
01:07:59,327 --> 01:08:00,556
Don't shoot me!

577
01:08:01,763 --> 01:08:03,025
Hey, wait a minute!

578
01:08:06,034 --> 01:08:07,695
What's the matter with you?

579
01:08:10,105 --> 01:08:11,436
Hold out your hands.

580
01:08:12,542 --> 01:08:14,064
Let me see your hands!

581
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:19,344
You're a guest!

582
01:08:19,415 --> 01:08:20,905
You really gave me a scare.

583
01:08:21,016 --> 01:08:24,281
Look, everything's broken down.
The machines have gone crazy.

584
01:08:24,453 --> 01:08:25,943
You know about the machines?

585
01:08:26,122 --> 01:08:27,749
Yeah, I repair 'em.

586
01:08:27,824 --> 01:08:30,315
There's one chasing me now.
A gunslinger.

587
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:31,618
Gunslinger.

588
01:08:32,462 --> 01:08:35,396
Must be a model 404, maybe a 406.

589
01:08:35,697 --> 01:08:38,667
If he's a 406,
he's got all the sensory equipment.

590
01:08:39,234 --> 01:08:40,667
It's a beautiful machine!

591
01:08:40,770 --> 01:08:41,827
He's after me!

592
01:08:41,903 --> 01:08:42,997
I don't doubt it.

593
01:08:43,105 --> 01:08:44,095
What can I do?

594
01:08:44,173 --> 01:08:46,266
There's nothing you can do.
He'll get you.

595
01:08:46,343 --> 01:08:47,776
You haven't got a chance.

596
01:08:47,844 --> 01:08:49,641
There must be something!

597
01:08:49,712 --> 01:08:52,547
Fella, don't kid yourself.
There are things you could try:

598
01:08:52,716 --> 01:08:56,014
Acid for his visual system,
noise for his hearing...

599
01:08:57,021 --> 01:08:59,352
No matter what,
he'll always be one jump ahead of you!

600
01:08:59,423 --> 01:09:00,913
You haven't got a chance!

601
01:09:05,262 --> 01:09:06,353
Yes, I do.

602
01:23:31,694 --> 01:23:33,059
Help me!

603
01:23:40,035 --> 01:23:41,435
Help me!

604
01:23:46,543 --> 01:23:48,009
Help me!

605
01:23:54,383 --> 01:23:55,975
Help me!

606
01:24:00,289 --> 01:24:02,155
All right. It's all right.

607
01:24:23,914 --> 01:24:25,040
- It's okay.
- Help me!

608
01:24:25,116 --> 01:24:26,514
All right, all right.

609
01:24:26,584 --> 01:24:28,552
- Help me!
- You're gonna be all right.

610
01:24:28,987 --> 01:24:30,181
Help me!

611
01:24:43,635 --> 01:24:44,863
No water...

612
01:24:45,371 --> 01:24:47,430
- Go ahead. Go ahead and drink.
- No water...

613
01:24:47,505 --> 01:24:50,303
- I'm trying to help you.
- No water. No. No!

614
01:27:05,815 --> 01:27:08,147
Why don't you make arrangements
to take our Hovercraft...

615
01:27:08,218 --> 01:27:10,947
...to Medieval World, Roman World
and Westworld.

616
01:27:11,287 --> 01:27:13,983
Contact us today,
or see your travel agent.

617
01:27:14,124 --> 01:27:17,457
Boy, have we got a vacation for you,
vacation for you...

618
01:27:17,528 --> 01:27:20,157
...for you, for you, for you...
