<i>(Speaking In A Girlish, Dreamy Voice)</i>
<i>Someone is here.</i>

2
00:00:41,767 --> 00:00:45,316
Not closely.

3
00:00:45,487 --> 00:00:49,275
Not willingly.

4
00:00:49,447 --> 00:00:52,644
I feel a holding back.

5
00:00:52,807 --> 00:00:55,196
What's the trouble, Henry?

6
00:00:57,007 --> 00:01:02,035
(In Deep Male Voice)
Too many memories, too much pain.

7
00:01:02,207 --> 00:01:06,723
Too... much... sorrow.

8
00:01:09,887 --> 00:01:12,720
(In High Voice)
Whoever is there with you,

9
00:01:12,887 --> 00:01:16,038
<i>tell them to speak up, Henry.</i>

10
00:01:16,207 --> 00:01:19,040
<i>Tell them to come closer.</i>

11
00:01:19,207 --> 00:01:22,722
<i>(Woman 2) I think I know</i>
<i>who it is, Madame Blanche.</i>

12
00:01:22,887 --> 00:01:25,879
I think I know what's bothering her.

13
00:01:26,047 --> 00:01:29,676
(In High Voice) Her, is it?
Never you mind, Miss Rainbird.

14
00:01:29,847 --> 00:01:31,803
I won't have you doing
Henry's work for him.

<i>(Moaning, Gasping)</i>

16
00:01:34,007 --> 00:01:37,886
<i>Now, let's have it, my love.</i>
<i>That's why we're here tonight.</i>

17
00:01:38,047 --> 00:01:40,436
<i>To help my friend be rid of her torment.</i>

18
00:01:40,607 --> 00:01:45,362
She has a right to rest her weary head
on a pillow each night

19
00:01:45,527 --> 00:01:49,361
and sleep the peaceful
sleep of the angels.

20
00:01:49,527 --> 00:01:52,121
H-How did you know
about my troubled sleep?

21
00:01:52,287 --> 00:01:53,640
Who told you?

22
00:01:53,807 --> 00:01:57,561
Her nights cannot
go on like this much longer.

23
00:01:57,727 --> 00:02:00,764
L-I never told a soul
about my nightmares.

24
00:02:00,927 --> 00:02:04,124
- How could you -
- Who is this person who arrives

25
00:02:04,287 --> 00:02:07,563
in our presence tonight,
but does not dare to come close to us?

26
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:12,482
It's her. Its my sister, Harriet.

27
00:02:12,647 --> 00:02:16,879
- It must be.
- (Henry's Voice) She stays her distance,

28
00:02:17,047 --> 00:02:19,641
Julia Rainbird, for she does not feel

29
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:21,877
your love or your kindness yet.

30
00:02:22,047 --> 00:02:25,244
There is selfishness where you are.

31
00:02:25,407 --> 00:02:28,205
I've had all I can take from her.

32
00:02:28,367 --> 00:02:31,518
Night after night, coming into my dreams.

33
00:02:32,327 --> 00:02:35,637
<i>Whining, complaining,</i>
<i>trying to make me feel guilty,</i>

34
00:02:35,807 --> 00:02:38,685
<i>as though I need her</i>
<i>to tell me right from wrong.</i>

35
00:02:38,847 --> 00:02:42,635
Tell her I know what has to be done.

36
00:02:42,807 --> 00:02:46,038
I've been wanting to do it for a year.

37
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:50,120
But it is I, Julia Rainbird,
who has made the decision.

38
00:02:51,407 --> 00:02:54,479
(Sighing)
I don't need her to goad me on!

39
00:02:54,647 --> 00:02:59,641
<i>They're making me ill</i>
<i>with their ugly words in my ugly dreams.</i>

40
00:02:59,807 --> 00:03:03,402
Tell her to stop it,
to go away and leave me alone.

41
00:03:03,567 --> 00:03:07,037
(Stammering) Oh, no. No, no.
Don't let her go!

42
00:03:07,207 --> 00:03:10,324
- Don't let her go away.
- Harriet?

43
00:03:10,487 --> 00:03:12,364
Harriet, stay with us, Harriet.

44
00:03:12,527 --> 00:03:16,918
<i>Your sister wants to speak to you now,</i>
<i>from the depths of her soul.</i>

45
00:03:17,087 --> 00:03:19,601
(Wailing, Howling)

46
00:03:19,767 --> 00:03:21,803
- What's wrong? What is it?
- (Wailing Continues)

47
00:03:21,967 --> 00:03:25,926
<i>She says,</i> "<i>I've waited so long</i>

48
00:03:26,087 --> 00:03:28,043
to hear from you, Julia."

49
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:30,846
"I've been so unhappy without you."

50
00:03:32,927 --> 00:03:35,680
It is you, Harriet.

51
00:03:35,847 --> 00:03:38,884
Oh, I'm so sorry!

52
00:03:39,047 --> 00:03:41,607
L-I should never have made you do it.

53
00:03:41,767 --> 00:03:44,600
<i>Oh, it's all past now.</i>

54
00:03:44,767 --> 00:03:47,759
<i>But I'll do what I can to make up for it.</i>

55
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:51,920
If he's still alive, I'll find your son.

56
00:03:52,087 --> 00:03:56,046
<i>And I'll take him</i>
<i>in my arms and love him</i>

57
00:03:56,207 --> 00:03:58,675
<i>as if I were you, my poor Harriet.</i>

58
00:03:58,847 --> 00:04:02,965
And I'll - I'll make him one of us.

59
00:04:03,127 --> 00:04:06,437
And give him everything. Everything!

60
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:09,358
(Whispering) Far away.

61
00:04:09,527 --> 00:04:11,597
So far, far away.

62
00:04:11,767 --> 00:04:15,157
Bu-But I need her. I need her help.

63
00:04:15,327 --> 00:04:17,841
I can't do it alone.

64
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:19,838
You see, I need her memory.

65
00:04:20,007 --> 00:04:24,478
<i>It's over 40 years ago, and I don't know</i>

<i>or who it was given to.</i>

67
00:04:26,367 --> 00:04:30,645
I don't know
where he is now or who he is.

68
00:04:30,807 --> 00:04:32,763
<i>(ln Henry's Voice)</i>
<i>The true measure of Julia Rainbird's love</i>

69
00:04:32,927 --> 00:04:34,519
lies in what she does now,

70
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:38,123
with your help, of course, and mine,

71
00:04:38,287 --> 00:04:41,245
and that of the dear, departed one

72
00:04:41,407 --> 00:04:44,365
who has drifted so far from us.

73
00:04:44,527 --> 00:04:47,599
(In Normal Voice) We understand him.
Don't we, Miss Rainbird?

74
00:04:47,767 --> 00:04:52,636
Oh, yes. Yes, I do.
I'm willing to do anything. Anything at all.

75
00:04:52,807 --> 00:04:55,321
(In Henry's Voice)
In the end, there will be happiness.

(Softly) Goodbye.

- (Moans)
- Madame Blanche! Are you alright?

81
00:05:16,887 --> 00:05:21,836
Oh. It was - (Clears Throat, Noisily)

82
00:05:22,007 --> 00:05:23,645
What in the world's been going on here?

83
00:05:23,807 --> 00:05:26,162
I feel as though
I've been properly done over.

84
00:05:26,327 --> 00:05:30,320
- Don't you remember what happened?
- Mm-mm.

85
00:05:30,487 --> 00:05:33,240
Not the details, Miss Rainbird,
only the gist, if you know what I mean.

86
00:05:33,407 --> 00:05:35,716
Suppose you give me the gist of it.
(Blows Nose)

87
00:05:35,887 --> 00:05:38,879
Oh well, I wonder - (Gasps)

88
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:41,402
Could I trouble you
for a sip of something? Ju-Just -

89
00:05:41,567 --> 00:05:43,046
Oh, of course. What would you like?

90
00:05:43,207 --> 00:05:45,641
Oh, a double shot of anyth-

91
00:05:46,807 --> 00:05:51,244
- A spot of that sherry might be nice.
- Oh, yes. Of course.

92
00:05:54,407 --> 00:05:56,796
(Sniffles) Thank you.

93
00:05:59,447 --> 00:06:01,324
(Clock Chiming Quarter-Hour)

94
00:06:01,967 --> 00:06:04,959
Now, tell me
what you remember of the seance.

95
00:06:05,127 --> 00:06:08,039
- In a nutshell?
<i>- Please.</i>

96
00:06:08,207 --> 00:06:11,244
Well - (Clears Throat)

97
00:06:11,407 --> 00:06:13,921
About 40 years ago,
you arranged to have

98
00:06:14,087 --> 00:06:17,443
your sister Harriet's baby
given away without a trace.

99
00:06:17,607 --> 00:06:20,644
<i>And now your bad dreams</i>
<i>and troubled conscience tell you</i>

100
00:06:20,807 --> 00:06:23,401
<i>to find the grown-up person,</i>
<i>take him into the family</i>

101
00:06:23,567 --> 00:06:25,159
<i>and bestow your wealth on him.</i>

102
00:06:25,327 --> 00:06:27,761
- Excellent.
<i>- Thank you.</i>

103
00:06:27,927 --> 00:06:31,124
And why did I force my sister
to give the child away?

104
00:06:31,367 --> 00:06:35,485
I guess the kid was a -
illegitimate, Miss Rainbird.

105
00:06:37,047 --> 00:06:40,039
I don't want you
to think me a puritan, Madame Blanche.

106
00:06:40,207 --> 00:06:43,563
But 40 years ago, an unmarried mother

107
00:06:43,727 --> 00:06:46,161
was not the commonplace
it is nowadays.

108
00:06:46,327 --> 00:06:48,045
And in a family like ours,

109
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:50,846
a scandal had to be
covered up at all costs.

110
00:06:51,007 --> 00:06:53,043
I understand.

111
00:06:53,207 --> 00:06:55,084
And I'm still sufficiently old-fashioned,

112
00:06:55,247 --> 00:06:57,920
<i>and sufficiently protective</i>
<i>of the Rainbird name,</i>

113
00:06:58,087 --> 00:06:59,884
<i>to want to seek the missing heir</i>

114
00:07:00,047 --> 00:07:02,880
in a private and secret fashion,

115
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:06,039
rather than go to detective agencies

116
00:07:06,207 --> 00:07:07,879
and put notices in the newspapers.

117
00:07:08,047 --> 00:07:11,437
A most wise decision, Miss Rainbird.

118
00:07:12,647 --> 00:07:15,445
Well, now, suppose we get to the reason

119
00:07:15,607 --> 00:07:16,801
for my sending for you.

120
00:07:16,967 --> 00:07:19,356
I'm 78 years of age.

121
00:07:19,527 --> 00:07:22,644
I would like to go to my grave
with a quiet conscience.

122
00:07:22,807 --> 00:07:27,005
Particularly as I know
that my only heir is out there somewhere,

123
00:07:27,167 --> 00:07:30,876
deprived by my acts
of his true Rainbird name.

124
00:07:31,047 --> 00:07:33,880
Will you help me with your powers?

125
00:07:37,047 --> 00:07:39,322
If in your heart you believe that I can,

126
00:07:39,487 --> 00:07:41,079
then I owe it to both of us to try,
Miss Rainbird.

127
00:07:41,247 --> 00:07:43,966
No, I'm too old for trying.

128
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:46,925
I've only time enough left for results!

129
00:07:47,087 --> 00:07:52,286
Find him for me, Madame Blanche.
Use your spirit-control, your "Henry".

130
00:07:52,447 --> 00:07:54,438
Get through to my sister.

131
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:58,395
Find her son,
whoever he is, wherever he is,

132
00:07:58,567 --> 00:08:01,639
and I'll pay you $10,000.

133
00:08:01,807 --> 00:08:03,798
Te-

134
00:08:05,327 --> 00:08:07,477
(Sighs)

135
00:08:07,647 --> 00:08:11,242
Only if you genuinely wish to,
Miss Rainbird.

136
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:15,036
But let's not think of this
as a payment to me.

137
00:08:15,207 --> 00:08:17,277
There are many causes dear to my heart,

138
00:08:17,447 --> 00:08:20,519
which need all the charity
the world can spare.

139
00:08:20,687 --> 00:08:23,804
You've no idea how refreshing
it is for a woman of my wealth

140
00:08:23,967 --> 00:08:26,527
to find someone
who has so little use for money.

141
00:08:26,687 --> 00:08:28,405
Thank you.

142
00:08:28,567 --> 00:08:32,162
(Sighs) Well, now, I regard
our arrangement as completed.

143
00:08:33,127 --> 00:08:35,960
I - It's my bedtime.

144
00:08:36,127 --> 00:08:38,436
I must take leave
of your delightful company.

145
00:08:38,607 --> 00:08:41,405
This has been a most memorable
evening for me, Miss Rainbird.

146
00:08:41,567 --> 00:08:44,479
See to it that you
make it a rewarding one.

147
00:08:44,647 --> 00:08:46,922
At the risk of repeating myself,

148
00:08:47,087 --> 00:08:48,918
I hope you will not forget

149
00:08:49,087 --> 00:08:51,078
that nobody, absolutely no-one,

150
00:08:51,247 --> 00:08:53,124
should know of our search.

151
00:08:53,287 --> 00:08:56,279
The Rainbird name must be protected.

152
00:08:56,447 --> 00:08:58,517
My jaw is locked.

153
00:08:58,687 --> 00:09:02,475
On that note, I will say goodbye,
and thank you for coming.

<i>- Murder.</i>
- Yeah, yeah. I know.

- She's hooked, waiting to be pulled in.

158

Another one of your $25 sardines?

159
00:09:52,167 --> 00:09:55,955
No. This is a big one, George.
A great big whale.

160
00:09:56,127 --> 00:09:58,118
Well, come on. Give.

161
00:09:58,287 --> 00:10:00,118
Keep your eyes on the road.
Don't rush me.

162

<i>Start way up at the top.</i>

164
00:10:05,087 --> 00:10:06,839
Well, it was as simple as A-B-C.

165
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:09,237
Henry came to me from
the Upper Brightness, whispered to me,

166
00:10:09,407 --> 00:10:11,238
"This woman's
been having sleep problems."

167
00:10:11,407 --> 00:10:14,638
From there on,
things followed naturally, logically.

168
00:10:14,807 --> 00:10:17,924
A-ha! So I came through for you again,
didn't I, darlin'?

169
00:10:18,087 --> 00:10:20,078
No. What are you talking about, George?

170
00:10:20,247 --> 00:10:22,158
What do you mean,
what am I talking about?

171
00:10:22,327 --> 00:10:25,046
You know damn well
what I'm talkin' about.

172
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:27,801
All that information that I dug up
by gabbin' to the local druggist

173
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:29,639
about how she was drivin' him crazy

174
00:10:29,807 --> 00:10:31,479
tryin' to get sleeping pills
without a prescription!

175
00:10:31,647 --> 00:10:34,878
That could have been
very, very useful to me.

176
00:10:35,047 --> 00:10:36,799
Why didn't you tell me about that?

177
00:10:36,967 --> 00:10:37,956
What do you mean, why didn't I tell you?

178
00:10:38,127 --> 00:10:40,482
I told you.
You know damn well I told you.

179
00:10:40,647 --> 00:10:44,196
No, you always think
you tell me things, and you forget to.

180
00:10:44,367 --> 00:10:48,246
I have to go through heaven and hell,
the Great Beyond, with Henry.

181
00:10:48,407 --> 00:10:51,319
Henry, my ass. It was me.

182
00:10:51,487 --> 00:10:53,398
It's always me.

183
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:56,604
Without my research,
you're about as psychic as a dry salami.

(Sighs) Nasty. Nasty, nasty.

185

I'm sick and tired of having you
have me by the crystal balls.

186

Leave your crystal balls
out of this, George.

187

No, let's leave Henry out of this
and keep the bullshit for your customers.

188
00:11:09,207 --> 00:11:11,038
You're jealous of him, aren't you?

189

I happen to be an actor, not a cab driver.

192
00:11:19,687 --> 00:11:22,520
I can play cab drivers, but I sure as hell
don't have to drive like one.

193
00:11:22,687 --> 00:11:24,757
Well, until I can collect
from Julia Rainbird,

194

I'm afraid you're gonna have to
go on playing a cab driver.

Well, how are we supposed to collect?

197

How much is this Rainbird whale
gonna spout up?

198
00:11:34,007 --> 00:11:36,885
Also, you're gonna have
to go on playing a private eye.

199
00:11:37,047 --> 00:11:39,277
Christ, no!
I've had it playing private eyes.

200
00:11:39,447 --> 00:11:42,644
Christ, yes! Now, George.

201

Stop blaspheming.

202

203

Now, wait a minute, Blanche.

204
00:11:50,807 --> 00:11:53,446
- Did you say ten big ones?
- Mm-hm.

205

- Ten thousand?
- Mm-hm.

- Dollars, George!

207

Now, Blanche, you got any idea

208
00:12:02,447 --> 00:12:05,086
what you and I could do with ten grand?

209
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:07,124
Mm-hm. We could even get married.

210
00:12:07,287 --> 00:12:09,960

Well, what's the deal?
What do we have to do?

213
00:12:14,527 --> 00:12:16,643
I'll tell you about it in bed, afterwards.

214

Aw, come on, Blanche. Give me a hint.

215
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:21,841
Just a little... (Chuckles) foreplay.

216
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:24,726
Alright. Find one man. That's all.

217
00:12:24,887 --> 00:12:27,720
Well, we've had to do worse than that.
What's his name?

218
00:12:27,887 --> 00:12:32,039
Hmm. Ah... nobody knows.

219

- Nobody knows.

221

Well, for chrissake!
You mean, nobody knows, Blanche?

222

Nobody knows his name,
or where he is, or who he is?

223
00:12:44,087 --> 00:12:46,043
Well, George, stop yelling.

224
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:49,643
There's a possibility
of one person who might have known.

225
00:12:49,807 --> 00:12:52,844
- Well, who's that?
- Julia Rainbird didn't mention him to me.

226
00:12:53,007 --> 00:12:55,316
Fortunately, her friend Ida Cookson did.

227

or our water bed will be
no fun at all tonight.

234
00:13:13,967 --> 00:13:17,039
As an actor, you should know
fretting will ruin a performance.

You're not gonna have to worry

00:23:04,247 --> 00:23:07,444
Then, when you get through it,
it makes you very,

306
00:23:07,607 --> 00:23:09,643
very loving.

307
00:23:12,407 --> 00:23:15,524
<i>- Darling, is it -</i>
- Hm?

308
00:23:15,687 --> 00:23:18,440
<i>It was all too easy. It's frightening.</i>

309
00:23:18,607 --> 00:23:21,917
(Sighs) Brilliant planning.

310
00:23:22,087 --> 00:23:25,443
They don't have a single lead to follow.

311
00:23:25,607 --> 00:23:28,167
<i>What about the</i>
<i>ketamine we stuck him with?</i>

312
00:23:28,327 --> 00:23:31,637
If Doctor Vogel didn't miss it six months
ago when I had my wisdom tooth out,

313
00:23:31,807 --> 00:23:33,525
he's not gonna miss it now.

314
00:23:33,687 --> 00:23:35,803
<i>Don't finish up in there. Let's go to bed.</i>

315
00:23:35,967 --> 00:23:39,357
- Tired?
<i>- Mm-mm. Tingling all over.</i>

316
00:23:40,487 --> 00:23:43,285
How'd I ever let you get me into all this?

317
00:23:43,447 --> 00:23:46,917
I thought I fell in love with you
because I needed some stability.

318
00:23:47,087 --> 00:23:49,806
Well, I guess you're just
a bad judge of character.

319
00:23:49,967 --> 00:23:53,164
- Where'd you put the diamond, dear?
- Where everyone can see it.

320
00:23:53,327 --> 00:23:55,238
<i>- You didn't.</i>
<i>- I did.</i>

321
00:23:55,407 --> 00:23:58,922
<i>- Are you gonna tell me where?</i>
<i>- You'll have to torture me first.</i>

322
00:23:59,087 --> 00:24:01,920
<i>Oh! (Giggling) I intend to.</i>

323
00:24:02,087 --> 00:24:03,600
<i>In a few minutes.</i>

324
00:24:07,207 --> 00:24:11,041
Now, with all due respect to the FBI
and the Bureau of Inspectors,

325
00:24:11,207 --> 00:24:13,243
I have no time to play games.

326
00:24:13,407 --> 00:24:17,161
Now, lest we forget, gentlemen, I have
been away from this desk forcibly.

327
00:24:17,327 --> 00:24:18,840
I've got a lot of work to catch up on.

328
00:24:19,007 --> 00:24:22,238
Now, how many more times we gonna
go through this goddamn thing?

329
00:24:23,327 --> 00:24:26,046
Until we come up with something,
Mr Constantine.

330
00:24:26,207 --> 00:24:27,959
That's a hell of a way
to solve a kidnapping.

331
00:24:28,127 --> 00:24:32,359
Mr Constantine, you're not
the first victim. There have been others.

332
00:24:32,527 --> 00:24:35,041
<i>Alright, alright. But from me,</i>
<i>you'll learn absolutely nothing.</i>

333
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:37,596
- You never know.
<i>- I know.</i>

334
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:39,564
Alright. Floyd?

335
00:24:39,727 --> 00:24:41,922
Now. The underground garage.

336
00:24:42,087 --> 00:24:44,647
- Full of cars.
<i>- Sounds?</i>

337
00:24:44,807 --> 00:24:46,877
- People, behind me.
- Was it a man, or was it a woman?

338
00:24:47,047 --> 00:24:48,639
<i>- I don't know.</i>
- Man or woman?

339
00:24:48,807 --> 00:24:50,877
- Man.
- Then what?

340
00:24:51,047 --> 00:24:54,835
(Grunts) It was a prick in my shoulder.
I started to turn.

341
00:24:55,007 --> 00:24:57,316
Eh - And I woke up in a room.

342
00:24:57,487 --> 00:25:01,685
<i>(Floyd) Yes, and what did you hear?</i>
<i>Inside or outside?</i>

343
00:25:01,847 --> 00:25:03,803
The room was soundproofed.

344
00:25:03,967 --> 00:25:08,358
I never heard anything except
a disembodied voice of a loudspeaker.

345
00:25:08,527 --> 00:25:11,121
- Describe it.
- But I've already done that.

346
00:25:11,287 --> 00:25:13,403
Again!

347
00:25:13,567 --> 00:25:16,001
It was the voice of a man, no accent.

348
00:25:16,167 --> 00:25:18,681
Doctored up electronically.
Unrecognisable.

349
00:25:18,847 --> 00:25:20,246
How many of them were there?

350
00:25:20,407 --> 00:25:22,602
Two. A man and a woman.

351
00:25:22,767 --> 00:25:24,803
<i>Why do you say that?</i>

352
00:25:24,967 --> 00:25:27,765
Because the faintest light
filtered down from the hallway above.

353
00:25:27,927 --> 00:25:30,236
But not enough to give me
a chance to see who they were.

354
00:25:30,407 --> 00:25:32,318
- Yes, and who did the cooking?
- She did.

355
00:25:32,487 --> 00:25:33,476
<i>Why?</i>

356
00:25:33,647 --> 00:25:36,207
Because a man would not
bother to put the parsley

357
00:25:36,367 --> 00:25:37,880
on the filet of sole, that's why.

358
00:25:38,047 --> 00:25:41,198
- How old is she?
- Come on, now. Please.

359
00:25:41,367 --> 00:25:44,040
<i>- How old is she?</i>
- Twenty-five.

360
00:25:45,087 --> 00:25:47,043
- Why?
- Why?

361
00:25:47,207 --> 00:25:49,402
Because if a man my age
is gonna get kidnapped by a woman,

362
00:25:49,567 --> 00:25:51,444
he wants her to be 25, that's why.

363
00:25:53,807 --> 00:25:56,879
- Describe your return.
- The return.

364
00:25:57,047 --> 00:26:01,165
The disembodied voice
tells me to sit with my back to the door.

365
00:26:01,327 --> 00:26:04,125
The light goes out,
the door opens, they both come in.

366
00:26:04,287 --> 00:26:06,881
I feel a prick in my left arm.

367
00:26:07,047 --> 00:26:09,038
The next thing I know,
I wake up in that hospital bed

368
00:26:09,207 --> 00:26:11,323
with you sitting there,
thinking up questions!

369
00:26:12,887 --> 00:26:14,798
Thank you, Mr Constantine.
You're doing great.

370
00:26:14,967 --> 00:26:19,006
- That's what you think.
- Alright, let's start all over again.

371
00:26:19,167 --> 00:26:21,442
Aw, shit!

372
00:26:21,607 --> 00:26:23,598
<i>(Piano Playing, Birds Singing)</i>

373
00:26:47,767 --> 00:26:51,760
<i>(Blanche) Why, Henry, you have such</i>
<i>a beaming smile on your face.</i>

374
00:26:51,927 --> 00:26:53,758
<i>(Blanche Playing Henry)</i>
<i>I smile because I'm happy, Blanche.</i>

375
00:26:53,927 --> 00:26:58,762
<i>It comes through you, Blanche,</i>
<i>from your friend, Ida Cookson.</i>

376
00:26:58,927 --> 00:27:00,076
<i>(ln Blanche's Voice)</i>
<i>I'm her guide, Henry.</i>

377
00:27:00,247 --> 00:27:03,637
Friendship can be claimed only
when it cannot be denied.

378
00:27:03,807 --> 00:27:06,560
(In Henry's Voice)
Tell Ida Cookson we're all thankful here

379
00:27:06,727 --> 00:27:08,877
for the warm tranquility in her heart.

380
00:27:09,047 --> 00:27:12,642
<i>It will grow even warmer</i>
<i>as she trusts in you,</i>

381
00:27:12,807 --> 00:27:17,323
<i>and confides in you,</i>
<i>and holds back no secrets from you -</i>

382
00:27:17,487 --> 00:27:21,799
<i>be they her own,</i>
<i>or those of her intimate friends.</i>

383
00:27:21,967 --> 00:27:23,958
<i>(Blanche's Voice)</i>
<i>Did you hear that, Mrs Cookson?</i>

384
00:27:24,127 --> 00:27:26,402
<i>(Mrs Cookson) Yes, Madame Blanche.</i>

385
00:27:26,567 --> 00:27:31,687
<i>(Blanche) Henry,</i>
<i>I want you to seek Walter for us now.</i>

386
00:27:32,807 --> 00:27:36,846
Search through
to the Double Strand of Kindness, until

387
00:27:37,007 --> 00:27:39,805
my friend Ida Cookson
is joined in loving communication

388
00:27:39,967 --> 00:27:42,276
<i>with her dear, departed husband.</i>

389
00:27:43,367 --> 00:27:44,720
(In Henry's Voice) I will try, Blanche.

390
00:27:44,887 --> 00:27:49,039
But first, the mist must part a little,
and the veil must rise

391
00:27:49,207 --> 00:27:52,756
to let in the light
that will show us the path.

392
00:27:52,927 --> 00:27:55,043
(In Blanche's Voice)
Ah, I'm ready now, Henry.

393
00:27:55,207 --> 00:27:59,405
Ready! Ready to follow you,
wherever you want me to go.

394
00:27:59,567 --> 00:28:02,035
Where? Where are you taking me, Henry?

395
00:28:02,207 --> 00:28:04,437
(Gasps) Yes, yes, yes! I see.

396
00:28:04,607 --> 00:28:07,917
I see your hand beckoning to me.
(Laughing)

397
00:28:08,087 --> 00:28:11,443
Oh, what a lovely garden, Henry.

398
00:28:11,607 --> 00:28:13,882
My, my. Oh!

399
00:28:14,047 --> 00:28:16,800
Is that - Is that a statue there?

400
00:28:16,967 --> 00:28:21,358
Oh! Could this be Walter
standing beside the fountain?

401
00:28:24,207 --> 00:28:25,640
- (Whispering) How can you do this?
- I need your car keys.

402
00:28:25,807 --> 00:28:27,399
- I'm in a hurry.
- (Moaning) Oh!

403
00:28:27,567 --> 00:28:30,081
Do you realise what damage you can do
my psyche, breaking in this way?

404
00:28:30,247 --> 00:28:31,885
Just give me your keys. I need 'em.

405
00:28:32,047 --> 00:28:33,639
(Shouting) Yes, Henry!
(Whispering) What for?

406
00:28:33,807 --> 00:28:35,798
I've located the daughter
of the Rainbird chauffeur.

407
00:28:35,967 --> 00:28:38,356
- And I'm not going as a cab driver.
- (Shouting) Oh!

408
00:28:38,527 --> 00:28:40,643
- What will I do without my car?
- I don't care what you do.

409
00:28:40,807 --> 00:28:44,038
- Take a taxi. Just give me the keys.
- The trees are swaying!

410
00:28:44,207 --> 00:28:46,243
And the branches part!

411
00:28:46,407 --> 00:28:48,762
But there's no-one there!
(Whispering) Here.

412
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:51,441
I see shadows falling!
The air is getting cold!

413
00:28:51,607 --> 00:28:54,167
The brightness... dims. Good-bye, Henry!

414
00:28:54,767 --> 00:28:56,917
Oh! (Chimes Tinkling)

415
00:28:57,087 --> 00:28:59,760
(Gasps) Did you find Walter?

416
00:29:00,887 --> 00:29:02,957
- Where?
- In the kitchen.

417
00:29:04,807 --> 00:29:06,479
I did.

418
00:29:09,127 --> 00:29:11,357
(Chattering)

419
00:29:20,207 --> 00:29:23,563
I wonder if I could speak to you
for a couple minutes, Mrs Hannagan.

420
00:29:23,727 --> 00:29:26,161
Why, sure. Do we know each other?

421
00:29:26,327 --> 00:29:30,036
No, I'm Frank McBride, of the law firm
of Ferguson, Ferguson & McBride

422
00:29:30,207 --> 00:29:31,959
and I just wondered if you would mind

423
00:29:32,127 --> 00:29:34,960
answering a couple questions
about your background.

424
00:29:35,127 --> 00:29:36,446
- My background?
- Mm-hm.

425
00:29:36,607 --> 00:29:38,325
(Chuckles) Dull as dishwater.

426
00:29:38,487 --> 00:29:41,285
I mean, what in the world
would you be wanting with that?

427
00:29:41,447 --> 00:29:43,597
Well, let's just say that the, uh,

428
00:29:43,767 --> 00:29:47,157
information that I'm interested in
could be worth a great deal of money.

429
00:29:48,047 --> 00:29:50,277
- Oh, yeah? To whom?
- Mm-hm.

430
00:29:50,447 --> 00:29:54,042
Well, we'll get around to that pleasant
subject in a minute, if you don't mind.

431
00:29:54,207 --> 00:29:56,004
- OK.
- Oh, swell.

432
00:29:56,967 --> 00:29:58,798
Now, why don't we just
start at the beginning?

433
00:29:58,967 --> 00:30:01,959
- Your parents.
- Oh, they're both dead. God rest 'em.

434
00:30:02,127 --> 00:30:05,836
- Your father was a chauffeur, right?
- How did you know that?

435
00:30:06,007 --> 00:30:08,999
(Chuckles) He was a chauffeur
for the Rainbird family.

436
00:30:09,167 --> 00:30:13,683
Right again! You'd be
a hell of a detective, Mr McBride.

437
00:30:13,847 --> 00:30:16,236
(Chuckles)
I don't know about that, my dear.

438
00:30:16,407 --> 00:30:20,639
Now, during this period of time, though,
can you remember anybody, uh,

439
00:30:20,807 --> 00:30:23,401
being a close friend of your father's?

440
00:30:23,567 --> 00:30:26,525
Uh, there was a man.
It was way back when I was in school.

441
00:30:26,687 --> 00:30:28,837
Uh, there was this guy
that my father used to drink beer with

442
00:30:29,007 --> 00:30:31,316
and shoot pool with down in the village.

443
00:30:31,487 --> 00:30:36,163
This Harry Shoebridge
had a poultry shop with his wife, Sadie.

444
00:30:36,327 --> 00:30:37,726
- (Chuckles)
- Shoebridge.

445
00:30:37,887 --> 00:30:40,845
Yeah. His business was always lousy,

446
00:30:41,007 --> 00:30:42,520
even when times were good.

447
00:30:42,687 --> 00:30:44,405
And she used to have miscarriages

448
00:30:44,567 --> 00:30:46,797
like other women have birthdays.

449
00:30:46,967 --> 00:30:49,720
Well, they stopped trying,
and they moved away

450
00:30:49,887 --> 00:30:53,197
to Barlow Creek,
and, uh, adopted a kid, I think.

451
00:30:53,367 --> 00:30:56,484
- A boy?
- Yeah. An infant.

452

00:31:10,687 --> 00:31:13,042
to the Shoebridge's all alone,
and then getting in

458
00:31:13,207 --> 00:31:16,199
a big fight with ma because
he'd come home at 4:00am,

what he was doing or something.

my ma was damn mad
at the Shoebridge's,

never showed up at the funeral.

00:42:43,567 --> 00:42:46,639
I'm prepared to pay
a reasonable sum of cash,

606
00:42:46,807 --> 00:42:51,483
right now, for any information
that could lead me to Eddie Shoebridge.

607
00:42:52,487 --> 00:42:54,557
Where I come from,
lawyers are usually bad news.

608
00:42:54,727 --> 00:42:57,116
Oh, no. Not this time.
This time they're good news.

609
00:42:57,287 --> 00:42:58,925
<i>Matter of fact,</i>
<i>I think that Eddie Shoebridge</i>

610
00:42:59,087 --> 00:43:01,237
<i>would be delighted</i>
<i>when he hears from me.</i>

611
00:43:01,407 --> 00:43:03,284
What are you gonna tell him?

612
00:43:03,447 --> 00:43:06,723
Well, my client has asked me
to keep that confidential.

613
00:43:06,887 --> 00:43:09,037
Who hired you to find this guy?

614
00:43:10,407 --> 00:43:14,195
- That's confidential also.
- Sure like to help you, Mister -

615
00:43:14,367 --> 00:43:16,164
Business ain't all that good around here.

616
00:43:17,167 --> 00:43:19,397
- I think you can help me.
- Is that right?

617
00:43:19,567 --> 00:43:23,719
See, people around here have been
telling me that Eddie Shoebridge is dead.

618
00:43:23,887 --> 00:43:26,447
(Sighs) Well, if he's dead,
looks like he ain't gonna be hearin'

619
00:43:26,607 --> 00:43:29,041
all that good news
you have to tell him, huh?

620
00:43:29,207 --> 00:43:31,437
<i>I think he's alive.</i>

621
00:43:31,607 --> 00:43:35,759
(Sighs)
Sure don't keep this car very clean.

622
00:43:35,927 --> 00:43:40,398
You want to tell me why you put
a headstone on an empty grave, Maloney?

623
00:43:40,567 --> 00:43:42,558
What headstone?

624
00:43:42,727 --> 00:43:46,959
The one you paid $395 for back in 1965.

625
00:43:48,887 --> 00:43:51,082
You owe me $2.47, mister.

626
00:43:51,247 --> 00:43:53,761
Two weeks before that,
you went to the county courthouse

627
00:43:53,927 --> 00:43:56,839
and asked for a certificate
of death for Edward Shoebridge,

628
00:43:57,007 --> 00:43:58,759
and you were turned down.

629
00:44:01,967 --> 00:44:04,640
- You wanna give me your credit card?
- No.

630
00:44:04,807 --> 00:44:06,798
Credit cards are out.

631
00:44:13,807 --> 00:44:17,197
Like you, I prefer to pay... in cash.

632
00:44:19,447 --> 00:44:21,438
(Engine Starting)

633
00:44:23,207 --> 00:44:25,198
<i>- (Car Leaving)</i>
<i>- (Bell Dinging)</i>

634
00:44:36,087 --> 00:44:38,806
Now, this one happens to be
my personal favourite.

635
00:44:39,967 --> 00:44:42,435
Isn't it exquisite?

636
00:44:42,607 --> 00:44:45,167
<i>(Woman) Probably too expensive for me.</i>

637
00:44:45,327 --> 00:44:48,603
<i>- (Bell Dings)</i>
<i>- (Woman 2) Can I help you, sir?</i>

638
00:44:53,767 --> 00:44:57,965
Excuse me. I'll be right back.
Uh, Mrs Clay?

639
00:44:58,127 --> 00:45:00,516
<i>Would you take care</i>
<i>of Mrs Cunningham for a few moments?</i>

640
00:45:00,687 --> 00:45:02,643
<i>(Woman 2) Certainly, Mr Adamson.</i>

641
00:45:05,367 --> 00:45:09,246
<i>(Mrs Cunningham)</i>
<i>I'm afraid I rather like it.</i>

642
00:45:09,407 --> 00:45:12,444
(Joe) Hey, Eddie. You old son of a bitch.

643
00:45:12,607 --> 00:45:14,598
If it's all the same to you,
I prefer Arthur Adamson.

644
00:45:14,767 --> 00:45:16,405
Now what in the hell are you doing here?

645
00:45:17,687 --> 00:45:20,645
Had to see you
about something kind of urgent.

646
00:45:20,807 --> 00:45:22,206
Couldn't you have phoned me?

647
00:45:22,367 --> 00:45:24,278
Some things
you don't put on no telephone.

648
00:45:24,447 --> 00:45:26,836
<i>Hey, uh, you got any booze around?</i>

649
00:45:31,487 --> 00:45:33,478
<i>(Bottle Clinking, Top Unscrewing)</i>

650
00:45:35,207 --> 00:45:37,437
<i>Alright, Joseph. What is it this time?</i>

651
00:45:37,607 --> 00:45:41,043
<i>- (Pouring Drink)</i>
- New freezer for your wife?

652
00:45:41,207 --> 00:45:44,643
Mother needs another operation?
Bookies threatened to kill you? What?

653
00:45:44,807 --> 00:45:47,480
Aw, come on, Eddie. You make me
sound like some kind of sponger.

654
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:49,399
Not that I ain't grateful
for all your favours.

655
00:45:49,567 --> 00:45:53,401
- Did I ever have a choice?
- OK, OK. Here it is.

656
00:45:53,567 --> 00:45:56,798
<i>(Sniffs)</i>
<i>First off, I gotta ask you a question.</i>

657
00:45:56,967 --> 00:46:00,482
- Go ahead.
- I'm tellin' ya. No shit now, Eddie.

658
00:46:00,647 --> 00:46:04,959
Can you think of any reason why anyone
would be sniffin' around in your life

659
00:46:05,127 --> 00:46:06,560
<i>after all these years?</i>

660
00:46:09,207 --> 00:46:11,402
I can't think of any reason at all. Why?

661
00:46:12,807 --> 00:46:15,401
Well, there's this guy
comes around the garage today

662
00:46:15,567 --> 00:46:18,445
tryin' to locate Eddie Shoebridge.

663
00:46:18,607 --> 00:46:20,598
<i>Claims he's a lawyer,</i>
<i>he's got good news for ya.</i>

664
00:46:20,767 --> 00:46:23,361
Won't say what, or who he's workin' for.

665
00:46:23,527 --> 00:46:25,995
Calls himself McBride.
I know he's a phony the minute I see him.

666
00:46:26,167 --> 00:46:29,921
- Police?
- No way. He's a real amateur.

667
00:46:30,087 --> 00:46:32,282
I traced his license plates
with the bureau -

668
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:34,324
Doesn't even drive his own car.

669
00:46:37,367 --> 00:46:40,404
"Blanche Tyler, 17 Castle Heights Road."

670
00:46:43,207 --> 00:46:47,246
- What did he look like?
- (Coughs) He's tall, thin, about 35.

671
00:46:47,407 --> 00:46:49,523
He's always got a pipe on.
Asking a lot of smart-ass questions.

672
00:46:51,807 --> 00:46:54,844
- What'd you tell him?
- Nothin'. Not a goddamn thing.

673
00:46:55,007 --> 00:46:57,043
I didn't have to. He knew everything -

674
00:46:57,207 --> 00:46:59,163
<i>fake headstone you had me put up,</i>

675
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:02,205
<i>how I tried to get you</i>
<i>officially declared dead.</i>

676
00:47:02,367 --> 00:47:04,483
<i>The son of a bitch says</i>
<i>he thinks you're still alive.</i>

677
00:47:05,207 --> 00:47:07,243
He's lookin' for you, Eddie.

678
00:47:07,407 --> 00:47:09,796
And any son of a bitch
who's lookin' for you,

679
00:47:09,967 --> 00:47:10,956
is lookin' for me.

680
00:47:17,287 --> 00:47:18,800
Well,

681
00:47:18,967 --> 00:47:21,845
whatever he's up to, he won't find me.

682
00:47:22,807 --> 00:47:25,116
You worry too much, Joseph.

683
00:47:25,287 --> 00:47:28,245
Yeah, I worry too much.
Of course, you only planned the fire,

684
00:47:28,407 --> 00:47:31,046
and locked your old man
and old lady in the bedroom.

685
00:47:31,207 --> 00:47:35,519
- I poured the petrol. I lit the rags.
<i>- And I thank you.</i>

686
00:47:35,687 --> 00:47:39,202
The happiest day
of my whole, inglorious childhood.

687
00:47:39,367 --> 00:47:43,155
Alright, you want to kid about it,
it's alright with me.

688
00:47:43,327 --> 00:47:46,080
- I'm gonna track this guy down.
- And then what?

689
00:47:47,447 --> 00:47:49,199
This.

690
00:47:51,487 --> 00:47:55,844
- You'll never change, will you?
- You got no cause to complain.

691
00:47:56,007 --> 00:47:57,486
When you needed me,
I was always there, wasn' t I?

692
00:47:57,647 --> 00:47:59,797
Look, put that thing away.

693
00:48:00,967 --> 00:48:04,323
And listen to me.
I want you to go back to Barlow Creek.

694
00:48:04,487 --> 00:48:06,205
<i>Do nothing, say nothing.</i>

695
00:48:06,367 --> 00:48:10,645
Let me look into this matter
in my own, quiet way.

696
00:48:10,807 --> 00:48:13,765
And if I need you for anything,
I'll contact you.

697
00:48:15,647 --> 00:48:17,638
<i>OK?</i>

698
00:48:19,567 --> 00:48:21,637
<i>(Folding Knife)</i>

699
00:48:21,807 --> 00:48:23,798
You're the boss, Arthur.

700
00:48:23,967 --> 00:48:27,437
Isn't it touching how... a perfect murder

701
00:48:27,607 --> 00:48:30,201
has kept our friendship
alive all these years?

702
00:48:31,407 --> 00:48:33,602
- You better believe it.
<i>- (Knocking At Door)</i>

703
00:48:33,767 --> 00:48:37,123
- (Door Opens)
- I'm sorry to disturb you, Mr Adamson.

704
00:48:37,287 --> 00:48:40,085
<i>There are two gentlemen here</i>
<i>to see you, from the police department.</i>

705
00:48:42,207 --> 00:48:44,767
Tell them I'll be right out.

706
00:48:44,927 --> 00:48:46,838
- (Door Closes)
- Jesus Christ, Eddie!

707
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:48,998
(Softly) Wait here.

708
00:49:01,967 --> 00:49:03,639
Arthur Adamson.
What can I do for you gentlemen?

709
00:49:03,807 --> 00:49:05,559
Sorry to bother you, Mr Adamson.

710
00:49:05,727 --> 00:49:09,197
Andy Bush, Bureau of Inspectors,
and this is Lieutenant Peterson.

711
00:49:09,367 --> 00:49:10,516
- Hi.
- My pleasure.

712
00:49:10,687 --> 00:49:15,044
No doubt you've been reading, or hearing,
about the Constantine kidnapping.

713
00:49:15,207 --> 00:49:17,198
I have a confession to make, Inspector.

714
00:49:17,367 --> 00:49:20,040
When I heard of the size of that stone,
my mouth watered.

715
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:22,801
- Professionally speaking, of course.
- (Chuckles)

716
00:49:22,967 --> 00:49:26,323
Well, just so you don't feel
discriminated against, Mr Adamson,

717
00:49:26,487 --> 00:49:30,526
we're routinely covering every gem dealer
and jewellery store in the city.

718
00:49:30,687 --> 00:49:33,360
Well, I'm flattered.

719
00:49:33,527 --> 00:49:38,237
Have you, by chance, noticed anything
out of the ordinary, Mr Adamson?

720
00:49:38,407 --> 00:49:41,843
Any unusual movement of large -
or small - stones

721
00:49:42,007 --> 00:49:43,599
into the markets these last few days?

722
00:49:43,767 --> 00:49:46,486
- Absolutely not.
- I see.

723
00:49:46,647 --> 00:49:48,365
I take it that you're
going on the assumption

724
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:51,405
that this, uh, "ransom stone"
has been cut up into smaller gems?

725
00:49:51,567 --> 00:49:54,286
- That's correct, sir.
- It makes a lot of sense.

726
00:49:54,447 --> 00:49:56,278
We think so.

727
00:49:56,447 --> 00:49:58,722
If I may presume to make a suggestion,

728
00:49:58,887 --> 00:50:00,366
it seems to me you ought to be covering

729
00:50:00,527 --> 00:50:02,961
the antique and
secondhand jewellery markets.

730
00:50:03,127 --> 00:50:04,276
They buy from anyone,

731
00:50:04,447 --> 00:50:07,883
whereas we jewellers buy exclusively
on the wholesale exchanges.

732
00:50:08,047 --> 00:50:11,119
- That's already being done, Mr Adamson.
- Oh!

733
00:50:11,287 --> 00:50:14,643
I think we've taken up
enough of Mr Adamson's time.

734
00:50:14,807 --> 00:50:17,799
Well, I'm sorry I haven't been able
to be of more help to you.

735
00:50:17,967 --> 00:50:22,119
However, if I do hear of any
unusual transactions in the marketplace,

736
00:50:22,287 --> 00:50:23,686
I'll be sure and contact you.

737
00:50:23,847 --> 00:50:27,840
- We'd appreciate that. Much obliged.
- Take care.

738
00:50:28,007 --> 00:50:31,204
- Goodbye, sir.
- Good day. And good luck!

739
00:50:47,287 --> 00:50:50,643
Mrs Clay, close up as soon as you wish.
I have some work to do in here.

740
00:50:50,807 --> 00:50:52,798
I'll let myself out the back way.

741
00:50:52,967 --> 00:50:54,958
- Good night.
<i>- Good night.</i>

742
00:52:01,087 --> 00:52:03,647
Your friend,
Blanche Tyler, is a spiritualist.

743
00:52:03,807 --> 00:52:05,035
<i>A spiritualist?</i>

744
00:52:05,207 --> 00:52:09,280
That's what it says on her shingle.
Also, there's no-one home.

745
00:52:09,447 --> 00:52:12,280
<i>A spirit is never at home. Get in.</i>

746
00:52:16,447 --> 00:52:19,644
(Sighs) What do you think we should do?

747
00:52:19,807 --> 00:52:23,482
We'll wait.
We still don't know who the man is yet.

748
00:52:23,647 --> 00:52:25,638
- Must you?
- Mm-hm.

749
00:52:35,207 --> 00:52:37,198
That must be her.

750
00:53:08,807 --> 00:53:12,243
That must be the fellow
with the pipe who called on Maloney.

751
00:53:12,407 --> 00:53:13,522
A cab driver.

752
00:53:13,687 --> 00:53:16,326
<i>Lumley. Lumley, what's this?</i>
<i>Where are ya goin'?</i>

No, you're not.

755
00:53:20,887 --> 00:53:23,606
Blanche, is that all
you've ever got on your mind?

756
00:53:23,767 --> 00:53:25,883
What are you saving it for, a rainy day?

757
00:53:26,047 --> 00:53:27,958
Honey, you never know
when you're gonna need it.

758
00:53:28,127 --> 00:53:30,083
You're not being friendly, Lumley.

759
00:53:30,247 --> 00:53:34,035
Blanche, I'm too pooped to pop.
I'd be useless to you.

760

You know what I'm talking about.
Come on inside and stop being difficult.

764
00:53:45,807 --> 00:53:47,638
Not tonight, Josephine. I'm outta here.

765

- If I'm a fink, you're an ungrateful bitch.

766
00:53:51,807 --> 00:53:53,798
- What about tomorrow?
- What about it?

767
00:53:53,967 --> 00:53:57,084
You've got important work to do.
I want you to be sure about Eddie Shoe-

<i>- (Passing Car Obscures Dialogue)</i>

How many times
are you going to tell me that?

770
00:54:01,847 --> 00:54:06,762
How many times do I have to tell you
that tomorrow I have to work in my cab?

771
00:54:06,927 --> 00:54:08,918
So it'll wait till Sunday.

(Engine Starting)

773
00:54:25,367 --> 00:54:28,916
You better give me a quick synopsis.
I'm confused.

774
00:54:29,087 --> 00:54:30,918
Simple. A cab driver is shacked up

775
00:54:31,087 --> 00:54:33,362
with a sex-starved medium
named Blanche Tyler.

776
00:54:33,527 --> 00:54:35,324
Don't ask me why,
but apparently they're on the trail

777
00:54:35,487 --> 00:54:37,876
of some spook named Eddie Shoebridge.

778
00:54:38,047 --> 00:54:41,926
Fortunately, not on the trail
of your favourite kidnapper and mine.

779
00:54:42,087 --> 00:54:43,759
How can you be so sure?

780
00:54:43,927 --> 00:54:46,600
You did hear him talk about
collecting a huge hunk of money.

781
00:54:46,767 --> 00:54:49,406
Couldn't that be the reward
that's on our heads?

782
00:54:49,567 --> 00:54:51,922
You got yourself a point there,
Frances, old girl.

783
00:54:52,087 --> 00:54:54,840
Only time will tell whether it's any good.

784
00:54:55,007 --> 00:54:56,486
One thing's certain.

785
00:54:56,647 --> 00:55:00,640
We're not going to change our game plan.
Not now.

786
00:55:01,807 --> 00:55:03,320
Buy me a drink, Arthur.

787
00:55:05,967 --> 00:55:08,527
A shiny car. A... limousine?

788
00:55:09,607 --> 00:55:11,882
Why does he drive so fast, Henry?

789
00:55:12,047 --> 00:55:14,800
<i>What's that? On the seat beside him?</i>

790
00:55:14,967 --> 00:55:20,200
<i>I hear the sound of a baby crying.</i>
<i>Quick, Henry, before he disappears.</i>

791
00:55:20,367 --> 00:55:23,325
Ask - Yes, I know.

792
00:55:23,487 --> 00:55:27,765
I... see him now.

793
00:55:27,927 --> 00:55:31,476
The uniform. A chauffeur.

794
00:55:31,647 --> 00:55:34,036
Words! Henry, I need words.

795
00:55:34,207 --> 00:55:37,040
Who? The what?

796
00:55:37,207 --> 00:55:39,163
(Panting) The Rainbird chauffeur?

797
00:55:39,327 --> 00:55:42,797
Good heavens.
Old Michael O'Keefe, our chauffeur.

798

<i>(Gasps) Where is Michael going?</i>

799

<i>Henry, ask him</i>

800
00:55:49,487 --> 00:55:52,160
Oh, more pictures are coming in too fast.

801
00:55:52,327 --> 00:55:54,795
I can hardly make them out.

802
00:55:54,967 --> 00:55:57,925
Henry, a graveyard, a headstone?

803
00:55:58,087 --> 00:56:00,362
<i>I don't like this, Henry.</i>

804
00:56:00,527 --> 00:56:03,121
<i>A shoe. Bridge.</i>

805
00:56:03,287 --> 00:56:07,166
A shoe bridge?
Oh, don't do this to me, Henry.

806
00:56:07,327 --> 00:56:10,956
- Speak to the chauffeur.
<i>- Oh, God, something's burning.</i>

807
00:56:11,127 --> 00:56:14,517
<i>The house.</i>
<i>Quick, Henry. The house is on fire.</i>

808
00:56:14,687 --> 00:56:16,962
Take me away from here.

809
00:56:17,127 --> 00:56:18,799
I don't want to see this.

810
00:56:18,967 --> 00:56:22,357
I can't bear the sound
of their awful screaming.

811
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:25,405
Go back to the chauffeur, Henry.
Get Michael into our presence.

812
00:56:25,567 --> 00:56:27,364
Miss Rainbird remembers him.

813
00:56:27,527 --> 00:56:29,518
Yes, I remember.

814
00:56:30,687 --> 00:56:33,076
Madame Blanche, listen to me.

815
00:56:34,007 --> 00:56:35,884
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

816
00:56:36,047 --> 00:56:40,802
I've remembered something else
that could be terribly important.

817
00:56:40,967 --> 00:56:44,164
Wait one minute, Henry. Before you go,

818
00:56:44,327 --> 00:56:48,240
Miss Rainbird deserves some kind of
assurance about Harriet's child.

819
00:56:48,407 --> 00:56:50,921
<i>He's a man by now,</i>

820
00:56:51,087 --> 00:56:54,204
<i>and we have to know,</i>
<i>is he happy, Henry?</i>

821
00:56:54,367 --> 00:56:57,404
Is he alive and well and happy?

822
00:56:59,367 --> 00:57:01,358
If you can't, you can't.

823
00:57:01,527 --> 00:57:03,995
<i>I certainly can't force you.</i>

824
00:57:04,167 --> 00:57:07,955
Yes. Of course she'll understand.

825
00:57:08,127 --> 00:57:12,006
<i>Until next time, then. Goodbye.</i>

826
00:57:12,167 --> 00:57:14,158
Goodbye, my love.

827
00:57:17,607 --> 00:57:19,802
- What happened?
- Don't you remember?

828
00:57:21,807 --> 00:57:25,322
- Not a blessed thing.
- Oh, it doesn't matter now.

829
00:57:25,487 --> 00:57:27,762
Listen, listen, Madame Blanche.

830
00:57:27,927 --> 00:57:32,159
Your Henry jogged my memory
of something I'd completely forgotten.

831
00:57:32,327 --> 00:57:36,240
When our poor old chauffeur,
Mike, realised he was dying,

832
00:57:36,407 --> 00:57:40,241
he wrote to me and said
there was one person on earth

833
00:57:40,407 --> 00:57:43,046
who had promised that
he'd make it his business

834
00:57:43,207 --> 00:57:47,325
to know where Harriet's son was
as long as he lived.

835
00:57:47,487 --> 00:57:51,446
It was the parson
who baptised the newborn baby.

836
00:57:51,607 --> 00:57:55,122
And there's an additional thing
I can tell you.

837
00:57:56,327 --> 00:57:59,603
Don't tell me. Let me guess.

838
00:57:59,767 --> 00:58:00,756
Five hundred.

839
00:58:00,927 --> 00:58:03,122
Not a penny.
Not even a hundred for expenses.

840
00:58:03,287 --> 00:58:04,845
It's all or nothing, George,

841
00:58:05,007 --> 00:58:07,316
until I can produce his name
and his present address.

842
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:08,886
Jesus, Blanche.

843
00:58:09,047 --> 00:58:11,356
However, she gave me a marvellous clue.

844
00:58:11,527 --> 00:58:14,166
- Here we go again.
- No, here you go again...

845
00:58:14,327 --> 00:58:17,046
to the man who might tell you
if Shoebridge is dead or alive.

846
00:58:17,207 --> 00:58:21,041
- Who's that?
- Bishop Wood at St Anselm's Cathedral.

847
00:58:21,207 --> 00:58:23,846
- Holy Christ, Blanche.
- No, George, not him.

848
00:58:24,007 --> 00:58:26,441
Bishop Wood at St Anselm's Cathedral.

849
00:58:26,607 --> 00:58:30,998
He was a parson once
and he baptised the Shoebridge baby.

Do you know how I could, uh,
make a date to see Bishop Wood?

854
00:59:28,247 --> 00:59:30,636
If you want to make
the appointment today,

855
00:59:30,807 --> 00:59:33,116
you'll have to make it
through the chaplain.

856
00:59:33,287 --> 00:59:35,562
Which one is the chaplain?

857
00:59:35,727 --> 00:59:39,356
When the service is over,
I'll show you where to go.

01:18:07,287 --> 01:18:09,278
He's all charm.

1055
01:18:52,207 --> 01:18:54,198
<i>(Blanche) Who's that?</i>

1056
01:18:54,367 --> 01:18:56,927
That's Maloney. He's after us.

1057
01:18:57,087 --> 01:18:59,078
Come on.

1058
01:19:08,367 --> 01:19:11,598
(Man)
Hey, guys, lets get the hell outta here.

1059
01:19:14,767 --> 01:19:15,836
<i>(Explosion)</i>

1060
01:19:39,327 --> 01:19:42,000
We better get the police.

1061
01:19:43,287 --> 01:19:45,278
And lose our $10,000?

1062
01:19:57,207 --> 01:19:59,198
(Bell Chimes)

1063
01:20:12,407 --> 01:20:14,238
May I be of some help to you, madam?

1064
01:20:14,407 --> 01:20:18,241
- I'd like to see some bracelets.
- Any particular kind?

1065
01:20:18,407 --> 01:20:21,160
Do you have anything with turquoise,
or perhaps pearls?

1066
01:20:29,607 --> 01:20:32,360
- Anything wrong with our houseguest?
- He's fine.

1067
01:20:32,527 --> 01:20:36,679
I gave him a very nice lunch
and a fresh bottle of wine.

1068
01:20:36,847 --> 01:20:40,522
- Maybe one of these will appeal to you?
- Are those seed pearls?

1069
01:20:40,687 --> 01:20:42,678
That's right.

1070
01:20:45,807 --> 01:20:49,277
- What are you doing here?
- These look like freshwater pearls.

1071
01:20:50,807 --> 01:20:53,162
The message has come through on KFAG.

1072
01:20:53,327 --> 01:20:55,966
<i>They've located the stone we asked for.</i>

1073
01:20:56,127 --> 01:20:58,118
<i>In New York. Harry Winston.</i>

1074
01:20:58,287 --> 01:21:00,039
Fifty-three carats.

1075
01:21:02,607 --> 01:21:04,802
These are very nice.
How much are they?

1076
01:21:07,127 --> 01:21:09,687
$315, including tax.

1077
01:21:09,847 --> 01:21:11,246
When do we make the pickup?

1078
01:21:12,367 --> 01:21:14,642
Tomorrow night, 9:30.

1079
01:21:14,807 --> 01:21:18,163
Good. Now go on home.

1080
01:21:18,327 --> 01:21:20,921
Would it be possible for you
to set these aside

1081
01:21:21,087 --> 01:21:23,396
<i>so that I can bring in my husband</i>
<i>and he can look at them?</i>

1082
01:21:23,567 --> 01:21:25,046
Of course, madam.

1083
01:21:25,207 --> 01:21:27,482
(Sighs) Now for the bad news.

1084
01:21:27,647 --> 01:21:29,922
<i>Take a look at this.</i>

1085
01:21:45,567 --> 01:21:47,558
Incompetent bastard. He blew it.

1086
01:21:47,727 --> 01:21:51,037
<i>Now we'll have to</i>
<i>eliminate these two ourselves.</i>

1087
01:21:51,207 --> 01:21:54,438
- Ourselves?
- That's right.

1088
01:21:54,607 --> 01:21:58,646
Tomorrow night,
right after we return our guest.

1089
01:21:59,607 --> 01:22:01,643
- I can't.
- You must.

1090
01:22:03,807 --> 01:22:08,085
Remember: Share and share alike.

1091
01:22:08,247 --> 01:22:10,636
You stop it! Stop it!

1092
01:22:16,127 --> 01:22:18,641
- Decided on this one?
- That'll be fine.

1093
01:22:18,807 --> 01:22:20,718
I'll have it wrapped.

1094
01:22:20,887 --> 01:22:24,436
<i>(Man) But it was more than that,</i>
<i>much more than that</i>

1095
01:22:24,607 --> 01:22:28,236
<i>that you left behind</i>
<i>as your precious gift to life.</i>

01:22:28,407 --> 01:22:32,764
<i>Yes, Joseph Maloney,</i>
<i>you were a generous man.</i>

1097
01:22:32,927 --> 01:22:35,122
<i>You gave of your heart and soul.</i>

1098
01:22:35,287 --> 01:22:37,801
<i>You gave the very best that was in you,</i>

1099
01:22:37,967 --> 01:22:41,721
<i>and no more than that can be asked</i>
<i>of mortal man on this earth.</i>

1100
01:22:41,887 --> 01:22:44,321
<i>You loved your wife dearly.</i>

1101
01:22:44,487 --> 01:22:47,365
You bestowed upon
your dear mother and father

1102
01:22:47,527 --> 01:22:50,883
all the care, all the attention,

1103
01:22:51,047 --> 01:22:53,117
<i>patience and comfort that they needed,</i>

1104
01:22:53,287 --> 01:22:55,005
<i>in the sunset of their lives.</i>

1105
01:22:56,367 --> 01:22:58,198
And those of us who are left behind

1106
01:22:58,367 --> 01:22:59,880
to grieve for you, Joseph,

1107

<i>can only bow to the</i>

1110
01:23:11,927 --> 01:23:15,237
<i>Oh, how great the holiness of our God.</i>

1111
01:23:15,407 --> 01:23:18,046
<i>For He knoweth all things.</i>

1112
01:23:18,207 --> 01:23:21,756
<i>And there is not anything</i>

1113
01:23:21,927 --> 01:23:24,487
<i>And He cometh into the world</i>

1114

<i>He suffered that the pains of all men.</i>

1116
01:23:34,207 --> 01:23:37,802
<i>Yea, the pains of every living creature,</i>

1117
01:23:37,967 --> 01:23:40,435
<i>both men, women and children -</i>

<i>(Continues Indistinct)</i>

1119
01:23:53,887 --> 01:23:56,276
Can't you leave me alone?

1120
01:23:56,447 --> 01:23:58,358
Isn't it enough that you killed him?

1121
01:23:58,527 --> 01:24:01,917
That's not so, Mrs Maloney.
It was the other way.

1122
01:24:02,087 --> 01:24:04,760
You. You started it all coming here

1123
01:24:04,927 --> 01:24:07,487
and messing in things
that were none of your business.

1124
01:24:07,647 --> 01:24:09,842
Now go away. Please!

1125
01:24:10,007 --> 01:24:12,396
- Mrs Maloney, I have to talk to you.
- He's dead and buried.

1126
01:24:12,567 --> 01:24:14,319
- There's nothing to talk about.
- Why didn't he want me

1127
01:24:14,487 --> 01:24:17,047
- looking for Eddie Shoebridge?
- I am not listening to you.

1128
01:24:17,207 --> 01:24:18,401
Get away from me!

1129
01:24:18,567 --> 01:24:20,797
Mrs Maloney, your husband tried to kill
me, and you were in on it, weren't you?

1130
01:24:20,967 --> 01:24:21,956
No.

1131
01:24:22,127 --> 01:24:25,881
Then why are you always
running away from me?

1132
01:24:26,047 --> 01:24:29,039
Do you realise that you are
an accessory to an attempted murder?

1133
01:24:29,207 --> 01:24:33,439
- I had nothing to do with that.
- Perhaps the police'd think that you did.

1134
01:24:33,607 --> 01:24:37,043
- You want me to go to the police?
- For God's sake.

1135
01:24:37,207 --> 01:24:41,723
- You wouldn't do that -
- Tell me where is Eddie Shoebridge?

1136
01:24:41,887 --> 01:24:42,876
I can't.

1137
01:24:43,047 --> 01:24:46,483
Mrs Maloney, where is he?
Please tell me.

1138
01:24:48,647 --> 01:24:52,037
There is no Eddie Shoebridge.

1139
01:24:52,207 --> 01:24:57,122
He went up in smoke 25 years ago
and came down in the city.

1140
01:24:57,287 --> 01:25:00,245
He calls himself Arthur Adamson.

1141
01:25:01,407 --> 01:25:03,398
Arthur Adamson?

1142
01:25:05,967 --> 01:25:08,686
If he finds out I told you, he'll kill me.

1143
01:25:08,847 --> 01:25:12,442
Now go away,
and don't ever come near me again.

1144
01:25:16,287 --> 01:25:19,245
Fake! Fake! (Sobbing)

1145
01:25:33,287 --> 01:25:35,357
Wait a second, now.
You're the one that's exaggerating.

1146
01:25:35,527 --> 01:25:38,758
No, I'll give you two or three days
maybe I missed, but never more than that.

1147
01:25:38,927 --> 01:25:41,999
- Tell him it's deeply important.
- Shh!

1148
01:25:42,167 --> 01:25:44,283
- Stand up.
- Why me?

1149
01:25:44,447 --> 01:25:47,644
What makes you think that
it's me that ran up all the extra mileage?

1150
01:25:47,807 --> 01:25:52,597
What about that little asshole, Herbie,
or, uh, Al, the one on the day shift?

1151
01:25:53,487 --> 01:25:56,638
<i>I understand. I'll be there.</i>

1152
01:25:56,807 --> 01:25:59,162
<i>Yes, I promise I'll be there.</i>

1153
01:26:02,767 --> 01:26:03,756
The answer's no.

1154
01:26:03,927 --> 01:26:07,158
<i>He says I must work the shift,</i>
<i>and I must work it tonight.</i>

1155
01:26:07,327 --> 01:26:09,443
And do me a favour, Blanche.

1156
01:26:09,607 --> 01:26:11,723
Please don't give me a hard time.

1157
01:26:11,887 --> 01:26:13,718
You didn't put up much of a fight.

1158
01:26:13,887 --> 01:26:17,436
Honey, look. After all the goofin' off
I've been doin' on your behalf,

1159
01:26:17,607 --> 01:26:19,643
I'm within a gnat's eyelash
of losin' my cab

1160
01:26:19,807 --> 01:26:21,798
and gettin' kicked right out
of the company.

1161
01:26:21,967 --> 01:26:24,765
Lumley, you're thick!
You won't have to drive a cab

1162
01:26:24,927 --> 01:26:27,885
if you can get this thing over
and done with and collect the money.

1163
01:26:28,047 --> 01:26:30,197
"Lf", darling. You're always givin' me ifs.

1164
01:26:30,367 --> 01:26:31,800
I can't eat ifs and neither can you,

1165
01:26:31,967 --> 01:26:35,118
while Julia Rainbird and you
are waltzin' around in the Great Beyond.

1166
01:26:35,287 --> 01:26:38,085
Come on, sweetheart. The least I can do
is show up for work every now and then.

1167
01:26:38,247 --> 01:26:40,238
After all,
didn't I give you the guy's name?

1168
01:26:40,407 --> 01:26:42,637
But the phone book
is full of Arthur Adamsons.

1169
01:26:42,807 --> 01:26:46,277
It's very simple. All you need
to do is find out the right one.

1170
01:26:46,447 --> 01:26:49,120
That's a snap.
The one that's close to 40 years old

1171
01:26:49,287 --> 01:26:51,243
and trembles a little bit
at the name Eddie Shoebridge.

1172
01:26:51,407 --> 01:26:54,160
- Easy. We do that tomorrow.
- Now would be much better.

1173
01:26:54,327 --> 01:26:57,125
- A bird in the hand, Lumley. Please.
- Oh, sweetheart.

1174
01:26:57,287 --> 01:26:59,198
The only bird
that's gonna be in my hand -

1175
01:26:59,367 --> 01:27:01,039
and I'm very sorry to say this -

1176
01:27:01,207 --> 01:27:04,802
is a steering wheel
from 4:00 to midnight.

1177
01:27:04,967 --> 01:27:07,925
Sure. Why should I get a kiss?

1178
01:27:08,087 --> 01:27:10,920
Just when I was beginning to think
you weren't impossible.

1179
01:27:11,087 --> 01:27:12,076
Maybe I'll do it without you.

1180
01:27:12,247 --> 01:27:14,317
The hell you will!

1181
01:27:14,487 --> 01:27:16,125
Come on, now. Please.

1182
01:27:16,287 --> 01:27:19,120
This Shoebridge fellow's
gone to a lot of trouble not to be found.

1183
01:27:19,287 --> 01:27:22,802
<i>Now you got no idea</i>
<i>what kind of trouble you could get into.</i>

1184
01:27:22,967 --> 01:27:24,923
Whatever it is, he'll forget about it

1185
01:27:25,087 --> 01:27:27,157
when he hears about
the millions he's coming into.

1186
01:27:27,327 --> 01:27:29,283
Oh, Blanche, come on.

1187
01:27:29,447 --> 01:27:33,645
Just sit down
on your pretty little... behind.

1188
01:27:33,807 --> 01:27:35,923
And I must say, it is quite an -

1189
01:27:36,087 --> 01:27:38,396
No, it is. Very attractive little behind.

1190
01:27:38,567 --> 01:27:40,239
Just wait for me, OK?

1191
01:27:40,407 --> 01:27:45,003
And tonight when I get home,
we will, uh -

1192
01:27:45,167 --> 01:27:48,284
Right. Very nice. Plot our strategy.

1193
01:27:48,447 --> 01:27:50,438
Know what I mean, darlin'?

1194
01:28:05,167 --> 01:28:07,158
Who needs him.

1195
01:28:12,687 --> 01:28:14,678
(Buzzer Buzzing)

1196
01:28:17,527 --> 01:28:20,678
You wouldn't be Arthur Adamson,
would you?

1197
01:28:20,847 --> 01:28:22,838
Excuse me.

1198
01:28:27,687 --> 01:28:29,678
Excuse me!

1199
01:28:32,207 --> 01:28:35,085
Hello. Are you Arthur Adamson?

1200
01:28:35,247 --> 01:28:37,238
Hey, Art!

1201
01:28:38,887 --> 01:28:40,878
Yeah?

1202
01:28:45,247 --> 01:28:47,238
(Doorbell Ringing)

1203
01:28:54,287 --> 01:28:56,278
A A?

1204
01:29:05,367 --> 01:29:06,561
I'm sorry. We're just closing.

1205
01:29:06,727 --> 01:29:10,845
I understand.
I'm not shopping. Is Mr Adamson around?

1206
01:29:11,007 --> 01:29:13,441
I'm afraid not.
But if you come back tomorrow -

1207
01:29:14,207 --> 01:29:15,401
Alright.

1208
01:29:15,567 --> 01:29:18,127
But just to be sure
I have the right Mr Adamson,

1209
01:29:18,287 --> 01:29:22,360
- he is a gentleman of about 40, I trust?
- Yes, that's about right.

1210
01:29:22,527 --> 01:29:25,485
Oh, that's the first encouraging news
I've had all afternoon.

1211
01:29:25,647 --> 01:29:28,525
Isn't there someplace
I might reach him without delay?

1212
01:29:28,687 --> 01:29:30,086
- You mean tonight?
- Yes.

1213
01:29:30,247 --> 01:29:33,478
Well, he usually goes
directly home from here.

1214
01:29:33,647 --> 01:29:36,639
But tonight would be very bad
because I believe he's giving a party.

1215
01:29:36,807 --> 01:29:39,799
I know he left unusually early
for some such reason.

1216
01:29:39,967 --> 01:29:42,640
Isn't there something
I can tell him for you in the morning?

1217
01:29:42,807 --> 01:29:45,799
- This is personal. Rather personal.
- Oh, I see.

1218
01:29:45,967 --> 01:29:47,764
Perhaps you'd like to leave him a note.

1219
01:29:49,287 --> 01:29:52,279
- A note? Very good.
- Yes. Come this way.

1220
01:29:54,087 --> 01:29:55,076
Excuse me.

1221
01:29:57,607 --> 01:29:59,598
Thank you.

1222
01:30:11,847 --> 01:30:12,836
Is anything the matter?

1223
01:30:14,807 --> 01:30:17,037
Uh, I was, uh, just thinking.

1224
01:30:17,207 --> 01:30:19,437
Instead of leaving this note here,

1225
01:30:19,607 --> 01:30:23,520
it might be better
if I sent Mr Adamson a telegram tonight.

1226
01:30:23,687 --> 01:30:26,645
<i>- What's his address, please?</i>
- Well, I don't -

1227
01:30:26,807 --> 01:30:28,365
It's alright. We're friends.

1228
01:30:30,207 --> 01:30:32,641
- 1001 Franklin Street.
- 1001 Franklin.

1229
01:30:32,807 --> 01:30:36,163
Thank you very much.
You've been very kind.

1230
01:30:38,127 --> 01:30:40,038
You're a Capricorn, aren't you?

1231
01:30:40,927 --> 01:30:41,996
No, I'm a Leo.

1232
01:30:43,527 --> 01:30:46,166
That's what I thought.

1233
01:31:01,047 --> 01:31:02,878
- Pete, hi.
- Hello, there, Blanche, baby.

1234
01:31:03,047 --> 01:31:04,116
Have you seen George?

1235
01:31:04,287 --> 01:31:06,642
He just left a few minutes ago,
but he'll be back.

1236
01:31:06,807 --> 01:31:08,445
Took a party of four out to River Valley.

1237
01:31:08,607 --> 01:31:12,043
- Oh, dear. That could take all night.
- Easily. What's up?

1238
01:31:12,207 --> 01:31:14,277
- Would you give him a message for me?
- Sure thing.

1239
01:31:14,447 --> 01:31:16,802
- Just tell him I found him.
- You found him?

1240
01:31:16,967 --> 01:31:20,846
- That's right. He lives at 1001 Franklin.
- 1001 Franklin.

1241
01:31:21,007 --> 01:31:23,282
That's where he lives,
and that's where I'm going now.

1242
01:31:23,447 --> 01:31:26,041
You found him, and that's where he lives,
and that's where you're going now.

1243
01:31:26,207 --> 01:31:28,402
- Thanks, Pete.
- Any time, Blanche.

1244
01:31:37,447 --> 01:31:40,041
You wanna go over
the new pickup spot once again?

1245
01:31:40,207 --> 01:31:42,243
I know it by heart.

1246
01:31:42,407 --> 01:31:44,523
Are you alright?

1247
01:31:45,687 --> 01:31:47,678
- I will be.
- You sure?

1248
01:31:51,607 --> 01:31:54,804
Have to be there at 9:30.
Let's get going.

1249
01:32:31,567 --> 01:32:33,558
Bishop Wood, it's time to go.

1250
01:32:33,727 --> 01:32:36,116
Have you your vestments on?

1251
01:32:36,287 --> 01:32:39,165
"<i>Yes, but I haven't</i>
<i>finished the chicken.</i>"

1252
01:32:40,927 --> 01:32:43,839
I'm sorry, Your Excellency.

1253
01:32:44,007 --> 01:32:46,043
Here's what I want you to do.

1254
01:32:46,207 --> 01:32:48,038
Place the armchair
in the centre of the room

1255
01:32:48,207 --> 01:32:52,041
facing away from the door
and seat yourself in it.

1256
01:32:52,207 --> 01:32:55,438
You're going to be
comfortably put to sleep.

1257
01:32:55,607 --> 01:32:58,758
But it'll last only for a short while.

1258
01:32:58,927 --> 01:33:03,318
"<i>Thank you very much.</i>
<i>You are most considerate.</i>"

1259
01:33:03,487 --> 01:33:06,206
Let me know when you're ready.

<i>I haven't quite finished that book</i>

1261
01:33:09,367 --> 01:33:11,437

1262
01:33:11,607 --> 01:33:13,643
"<i>May I, uh, take it along?</i>"

1263
01:33:16,927 --> 01:33:19,157
With our fingerprints on it? Tsk, tsk, tsk.

1264
01:33:19,327 --> 01:33:22,125
Nice try, Your Excellency.

1265
01:33:22,287 --> 01:33:27,042
"<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>Don't bother, then. I'm ready.</i>"

1266
01:33:27,207 --> 01:33:29,516
Alright, I'll be turning your light off now.

- Is that cab driver with her?
- She's alone.

this pickup in 35 minutes -

Nothing!

1279
01:34:46,647 --> 01:34:48,638
Until later tonight.

1280
01:35:00,967 --> 01:35:03,276
- She's gone.
- Come on. Let's go.

- Mr Adamson?
- Watch him.

1284
01:36:30,727 --> 01:36:35,039
Oh, Mr Adamson.
How lucky I am not to have missed you.

1285
01:36:35,207 --> 01:36:37,357
Apparently you didn't hear me
at the front door.

1286
01:36:37,527 --> 01:36:41,156
I am Madame Blanche Tyler,
the spiritualist.

1287
01:36:41,327 --> 01:36:42,396
Good evening, honey.

1288
01:36:43,327 --> 01:36:45,079
Madame Blanche,
I wonder if I might suggest to you

1289
01:36:45,247 --> 01:36:47,681
to remove your car from our driveway.

1290
01:36:47,847 --> 01:36:50,042
- We're terribly late for an appointment.
- Well, yes.

1291
01:36:50,207 --> 01:36:54,246
When you hear why I've come,
Mr Adamson - Or should I say Shoebridge?

1292
01:36:54,407 --> 01:36:56,523
- You won't mind being late at all.
- My dear lady,

1293
01:36:56,687 --> 01:36:58,837
- I know exactly why you've come here.
- How could you?

1294
01:36:59,007 --> 01:37:01,919
And exactly why you and your friend,
that cab driver,

1295
01:37:02,087 --> 01:37:06,877
have been sniffing along my trail like two
eager bloodhounds the past few weeks.

1296
01:37:07,047 --> 01:37:09,242
I had no idea, Mr Adamson.

1297
01:37:09,407 --> 01:37:12,319
- Alright, Madame Blanche, you found me.
- Music to my ears.

1298
01:37:12,487 --> 01:37:13,966
I'm perfectly willing to listen
to your demands,

1299
01:37:14,127 --> 01:37:16,721
whatever they may be, but not right now.

1300
01:37:16,887 --> 01:37:19,720
No demands, Mr Adamson. Oh, no, no, no!

1301
01:37:19,887 --> 01:37:23,641
Hardly that.
Julia Rainbird wants nothing from you

1302
01:37:23,807 --> 01:37:28,005
but the privilege of making you
heir to the entire Rainbird fortune.

1303
01:37:28,167 --> 01:37:30,158
The whole,
lovely millions and millions of it.

1304
01:37:30,327 --> 01:37:34,559
<i>Now if she made any demands at all,</i>
<i>they were on me to find you.</i>

1305
01:37:34,727 --> 01:37:37,480
Through psychic means, of course.

1306
01:37:37,647 --> 01:37:40,639
Let me get this straight.
Is that the only reason you have been

1307
01:37:40,807 --> 01:37:42,206
shall we say, investigating me?

1308
01:37:42,367 --> 01:37:44,483
<i>Oh, yes. And don't think it's been easy.</i>

1309
01:37:44,647 --> 01:37:48,037
<i>Oh, Mr Adamson, you've given</i>
<i>George and me the devil's own time of it.</i>

<i>here I am.</i>

1315
01:38:14,847 --> 01:38:16,644
Does anyone know
that you've come here?

1316
01:38:18,207 --> 01:38:20,801
No one know -

1317
01:38:20,967 --> 01:38:23,356
Anyone kn-know?

1318
01:38:23,527 --> 01:38:26,837
No. Not a soul.

1319
01:38:27,007 --> 01:38:30,204
Not even George soul.

1320
01:38:30,367 --> 01:38:33,598
You have nothing to worry about,
Mr Adamson.

1321
01:38:35,127 --> 01:38:37,243
I promise.

1322
01:38:39,407 --> 01:38:42,843
I won't breathe a word... to anyone.

1323
01:39:02,527 --> 01:39:05,166
It looks like Miss Tyler needs some rest.

1324

Will you do as I say?

No. No.

01:48:28,567 --> 01:48:32,640
<i>(Adamson) If she was able to find us,</i>
<i>I'm sure he can too.</i>

1353
01:48:32,807 --> 01:48:37,244
<i>- He'll walk right into our hands.</i>
<i>- (Fran) Your hands, not mine.</i>

1354
01:48:37,407 --> 01:48:39,557
<i>(Adamson) Don't you think we ought to</i>
<i>go down and take a look at her?</i>

1355
01:48:39,727 --> 01:48:41,638
<i>It's been a while</i>
<i>since we gave her that shot.</i>

1356
01:48:41,807 --> 01:48:44,844
<i>- (Fran) You do it.</i>
<i>- (Adamson) OK.</i>

1357
01:49:13,207 --> 01:49:15,198
<i>(Door Opening)</i>

1358
01:49:55,607 --> 01:49:58,963
You'll be happy to know
she's still unconscious.

1359
01:50:20,127 --> 01:50:23,961
- (Whispers) Blanche.
- Shh!

1360
01:50:47,047 --> 01:50:50,357
I'll put this end into her exhaust pipe

1361
01:50:50,527 --> 01:50:53,644
and the other end in the window.

1362
01:50:53,807 --> 01:50:56,924
That way, it'll look like suicide.

1363
01:51:29,167 --> 01:51:31,237
Better go and get her now.

1364
01:51:31,407 --> 01:51:34,126
I'll take her in our car.
You follow in hers.

1365
01:51:47,007 --> 01:51:48,998
You take hold of her feet.

1366
01:51:53,647 --> 01:51:56,320
- Jesus, she's heavy.
- (Screaming)

1367
01:51:57,807 --> 01:51:59,798
George!

1368
01:52:01,807 --> 01:52:04,002
- (Panting, Coughing)
- Got 'em.

1369
01:52:07,807 --> 01:52:12,039
Blanche, you faked that one beautifully.
You are still the champ.

1370
01:52:12,207 --> 01:52:14,562
Thank you, George.

1371
01:52:14,727 --> 01:52:18,436
Do you realise how much
the reward is for those two?

1372
01:52:19,607 --> 01:52:21,325
(Chuckling) Yes.

1373
01:52:21,487 --> 01:52:24,684
But do you realise how much more
the reward would be...

1374
01:52:24,847 --> 01:52:27,839
if we could find the diamonds
and turn 'em in?

1375
01:52:33,807 --> 01:52:36,446
What's the matter with you?

1376
01:52:36,607 --> 01:52:38,598
I -

1377
01:52:38,767 --> 01:52:40,758
Blanche, what's the matter?

1378
01:52:51,367 --> 01:52:53,358
<i>Blanche, what's the matter?</i>

1379
01:53:07,007 --> 01:53:08,326
What is it?

1380
01:53:37,807 --> 01:53:40,037
Blanche, you did it!

1381
01:53:40,207 --> 01:53:42,198
You are psychic!

1382
01:53:44,207 --> 01:53:46,926
- What am I doing here on the stairs?
- You're not a fake.

1383
01:53:47,087 --> 01:53:49,885
You actually found one. Look.

1384
01:53:50,047 --> 01:53:51,241
I did?

1385
01:53:51,407 --> 01:53:53,716
I'll get the police on the phone
and give them our good news,

1386
01:53:53,887 --> 01:53:57,277
and call Miss Rainbird
and give her the bad.

1387
01:54:04,447 --> 01:54:06,642
Operator, can I have the police?

1388
01:54:07,642 --> 01:54:17,642
