1
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,493
Tobe!

2
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:51,415
- What?
- Where are you going?

3
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:55,778
- Out.
- Can I come?

4
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,691
I'd rather be alone.

5
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,532
Let me come!

6
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:05,618
- You don't even know where I'm going.
- So what.

7
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,534
Okay.

8
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,691
But don't be a pain.

9
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,216
You're lousy at spitting!

10
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,732
Cigarettes help.

11
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,013
Try.

12
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:01,409
But don't inhale,
and keep the smoke in your mouth.

13
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,539
Yeah, like that...

14
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,013
Hold it...

15
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,176
Enough, breathe out.

16
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,413
See?

17
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,891
Then he gets a bolt,
it was pretty big one...

18
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:44,815
- And sticks his hand out the fence...
- Wade's here!

19
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,773
Hold on.

20
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:51,574
Anyway, the fool sticks his hand out

21
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,970
and drops it down, can you imagine?

22
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:57,576
He smashed the windshield
of a passing car!

23
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,299
Hello!

24
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,770
- Anyone home?
- Hold on.

25
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:16,093
- Ever heard of knocking?
- I'll knock when you get a job.

26
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,693
Talk to you later.

27
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:22,613
Get dinner for you and Lonnie,
I'm going out.

28
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,658
I can't, April's on her way,
I gotta get ready!

29
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,253
She can wait.

30
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,060
I was with Lonnie all day,
I wanna go out.

31
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,053
15 minutes isn't a tragedy.

32
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:39,770
Buy chicken for him
and you keep the change.

33
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:55,016
- Can you manage alone?
- Sure.

34
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:46,816
- Come on, give me them!
- Take 'em!

35
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:05,176
- What was that?
- Nothing, the cat.

36
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,133
Really?

37
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:21,813
Can I?

38
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,657
I told you a million times
not to sleep in Tobe's room,

39
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,253
why don't...

40
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:34,896
you sleep in your room
with the light on?

41
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:37,017
I thought someone was outside.

42
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:42,696
If you heard noises,
why didn't you call me?

43
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,132
You don't like being bothered.

44
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,450
Not if it's for a shadow.

45
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,851
- Coming!
- You're a knockout!

46
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,734
- You're going to school like that?
- It's vacation.

47
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,697
Too many vacations,
that's why kids are ignorant.

48
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:06,295
- Where are you going?
- To the beach.

49
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,692
Wait!

50
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:15,131
- What now?
- Don't be late again.

51
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,019
Okay.

52
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,770
Where's your shirt?

53
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,255
She got a boob job at 18?

54
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:33,011
- That's sickening.
- No, I think she looks better.

55
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:36,650
- She must feel better too.
- Right, all the boys stare at her.

56
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:39,575
I say she's a stuck-up slut.

57
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,776
Yeah, she's a skank!

58
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:57,972
- Look, the tired pistolero!
- Does he work here?

59
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,814
Check out his hat,
he's a real cowboy.

60
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,772
What a riot!

61
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:08,134
- Here he comes.
- It's about time!

62
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:11,178
- Hilarious!
- What a weirdo!

63
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,773
Be quiet!

64
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,218
- Howdy.
- Howdy!

65
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,973
What'll it be?

66
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,890
Fill it up with unleaded, Tex.

67
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,018
My pleasure.

68
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:25,618
- He said "howdy"...
- Oh my gosh, he's pathetic.

69
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,016
Knock it off, Jeremy.

70
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,893
Tex, can you check the oil?

71
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,894
Sure thing,
I'll clean your windows too.

72
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,170
- Great, a real cowboy.
- Full service.

73
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:57,379
We promise a certain quality here,
so I have to deliver.

74
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:01,295
- Are you for real?
- What?

75
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:03,690
Are you for real?

76
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:06,018
I think so.

77
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,859
Wanna touch?

78
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,533
Yeah!

79
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,818
He's real!

80
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,733
- Can you believe it!
- In the flesh...

81
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,409
- You touched the cowboy.
- How cool!

82
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,019
How's the oil?

83
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,418
Fine.

84
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,616
The belt's a bit worn though.

85
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,418
Going far?

86
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:39,809
- Just to the beach.
- Really?

87
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,371
Lucky you, I've never been.

88
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,179
How long have you been here?

89
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,170
Not long.

90
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:51,338
Why don't you go?
It only takes an hour.

91
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,051
I can't, I don't have a car.

92
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,773
How come?

93
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:59,375
How come I don't have a car?

94
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,978
I don't like 'em...

95
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,218
they make us lazy.

96
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:13,014
Funny, you don't like cars
but you work here.

97
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,818
It's a job like any other,
I need it to get by.

98
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,930
So what about this belt?

99
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,932
It'll hold up.

100
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,818
Have fun.

101
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,015
Hey...

102
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,052
Wanna come?

103
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,012
To the beach with you?

104
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,332
Nice idea.

105
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,811
But maybe you're busy.

106
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,251
Dunno, I'll go ask.

107
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,933
Wait here.

108
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,212
Can we go?

109
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:10,416
I invited Tex to come with us.

110
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,210
- I can't believe it!
- Are you nuts?

111
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:17,418
- What are you thinking?
- Maybe he's a psychopath.

112
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:22,653
- Is he coming or not?
- I'm waiting for my change still.

113
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,493
Get lost!

114
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,772
Is the offer still available?

115
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,093
Sure.

116
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,851
You got the day off?

117
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,053
- More or less...
- More or less?

118
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:45,053
He said if I go,
I won't be able to come back.

119
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,773
Then why go?

120
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,096
I wanna sea the beach with you.

121
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,258
All right.

122
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,058
Come on.

123
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:09,451
- So, what's your name?
- Harlan.

124
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:11,179
That's it?

125
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:14,571
My full name
is Harlan Fairfax Carruthers...

126
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,572
Very full...

127
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,694
- What's your name?
- Tobe.

128
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:22,329
What's that short for, Toby?

129
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,453
Tabitha?

130
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:27,213
Tobias?

131
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,693
Manitoba?

132
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,373
October.

133
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,892
Really?

134
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,813
Cute.

135
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,458
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- Likewise, do you smoke?

136
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,976
You smoking a joint?

137
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,691
No thanks, I don't touch that stuff.

138
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,612
Where are you from?

139
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:52,090
- South Dakota.
- Really?

140
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:55,696
I knew a guy from there,
but he looked nothing like you!

141
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,418
What can I say...

142
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:09,529
Who would've thought
I'd see the ocean today.

143
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,132
Wanna swim?

144
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:16,010
- In the water?
- Yes.

145
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:19,894
I'd rather watch than drown.

146
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,332
I'll protect you.

147
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,736
I don't have a swimsuit.

148
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:29,131
Swim in your underwear,

149
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,291
like the Mexicans do.

150
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,612
I'd rather not.

151
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,652
Then swim in your pants.

152
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:42,615
These jeans can face the sea.

153
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,179
C'mon.

154
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:49,369
- You sure?
- You'll see, it'll be fun.

155
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,816
Gimme your hand.

156
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,813
Here it comes!

157
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,891
Are we too far out?

158
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,338
You okay?

159
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,010
We won't drift out to sea, right?

160
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:33,733
Relax, I won't let you drown.

161
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:37,420
This is how
I always imagined infinity.

162
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,691
Don't look out there,

163
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,931
just look at me.

164
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,892
Oh my goodness.

165
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,739
Well...

166
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,252
did you like the beach?

167
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,252
What time is it?

168
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,816
Dunno, it's late.

169
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,931
It's almost dawn.

170
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,891
I'd better go

171
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,731
or my father will kill me.

172
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:20,578
Hope not,
'cause I'd like to see you again.

173
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,131
You wanna see me again?

174
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,930
Yes, I had a good time,

175
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:32,618
but this isn't how people
normally get acquainted.

176
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,931
You're funny.

177
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,211
Hi, how do you do?

178
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,856
I'm Harlan, what's your name?

179
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,328
Lonnie.

180
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:22,338
Nice to meet you.

181
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:27,813
Darn, hope I didn't break it.

182
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:31,020
No, you just need to wind it up.

183
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,134
Right.

184
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,938
Good thing.

185
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:37,410
That's authentic, right?

186
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,540
I never saw one that works before.

187
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:44,136
- You a friend of dad's?
- Huh? No...

188
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,410
I'm here to take your sister...

189
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,813
to the city.

190
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,651
We're going downtown.

191
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,418
Is that all right?

192
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,695
Yes.

193
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,173
Great.

194
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,736
You're Tobe's brother, right?

195
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:11,011
- How old are you, 11 or 12?
- 13.

196
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:12,933
Really?

197
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,013
Sorry...

198
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:20,375
- I'll grow.
- Yeah, of course!

199
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,133
I just meant...

200
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:24,173
Sure.

201
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,896
I was smaller than you, at your age.

202
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:31,770
My uncle called me Twig,
said the wind would blow me away.

203
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,778
I was real small!

204
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,571
Then I grew.

205
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:41,053
- Where's Tobe?
- She's getting...

206
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,816
How do I look?

207
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,573
Dang!

208
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,339
Amazing!

209
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:51,450
- Hope it fits you.
- It's perfect.

210
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,130
- Aren't I cute?
- Yes.

211
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,018
You're real cute.

212
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:02,896
Would you like...
to get something to eat?

213
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:06,252
We'll bring your brother too,
then go dancing.

214
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:09,977
Hey,
wanna come get a sandwich with us?

215
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,133
Wanna?

216
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:13,934
Okay,

217
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,738
done deal!

218
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,218
Hi dad.

219
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,808
Hi.

220
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:27,016
- This is Harlan.
- Nice to meet you sir.

221
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,093
Wade.

222
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:37,175
- Where'd you get that outfit?
- Harlan bought it for me.

223
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,058
- What?
- Nothing.

224
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:46,054
I haven't seen you dressed like that
since you were 13.

225
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,575
A shame, with such a pretty daughter.

226
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,133
What do you do?

227
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,449
I...

228
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:58,136
I'm still finding my way.

229
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:01,372
- I've worked on farms.
- Not many farms here.

230
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:06,375
No, but you can't imagine
the work experience it gives you.

231
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,292
Nope, I can't imagine.

232
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:12,294
We're taking Lonnie to get a bite
then going dancing.

233
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,218
If you agree.

234
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,813
All right.

235
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,013
Shall we?

236
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:26,376
I'd like to say
I truly admire your daughter.

237
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:28,451
She's a beautiful person...

238
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:32,575
I hope to gain your trust.

239
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,373
C'mon.

240
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,972
Who is he?

241
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:44,575
- I met him at the beach.
- What?

242
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:47,380
- I gotta go.
- No, hold on.

243
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:53,698
- You worked on a ranch?
- Sure did.

244
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,688
Where?

245
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:58,012
In South Dakota?

246
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,818
There too.

247
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:03,172
But more here.

248
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:06,810
There are still ranches here?

249
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,573
Yes, some.

250
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:12,371
Most of them
were transformed or sold, but...

251
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:15,130
- You like animals?
- Yes.

252
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,654
Really?

253
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,696
Well, if you'd like...

254
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:24,295
we can go visit a big northern farm.

255
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:26,974
I don't mean
one of those tourist traps,

256
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:29,370
I mean a real ranch,
what do you say?

257
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,779
Yes.

258
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:38,940
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

259
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:41,498
Is that kid okay?

260
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:43,696
- Lonnie?
- Yes.

261
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,772
Yes, why?

262
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,976
Dunno, he seems like...

263
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:52,814
he needs to get out more or...

264
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,658
like he needs...

265
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:56,979
something.

266
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:00,380
He's still afraid of the dark.

267
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,576
He sleeps with the light on.

268
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:05,770
At least he can sleep!

269
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,413
Anyway...

270
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,218
he's fine.

271
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:12,292
Plus, I look after him.

272
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,416
You're a good girl.

273
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,252
I'm serious!

274
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:21,496
You have a big heart.

275
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,613
April!

276
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,612
Look who's here!

277
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:35,452
I wanna take it with you,
it'll make us happy.

278
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,656
I'm already happy with you.

279
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,851
Not this happy.

280
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,573
Let's go!

281
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,576
Hold on, be right there.

282
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:28,929
Howdy.

283
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:31,216
Window's open, what's going on?

284
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,018
Where's the cowboy?

285
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:36,218
What are you doing John Wayne?
C'mon!

286
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:39,015
We should love people, not cars.

287
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:40,654
I'm serious!

288
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,578
What'll we do?

289
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:46,130
We don't belong to all this,
you're all trapped inside.

290
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,814
We're just trying to go somewhere.

291
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:50,459
Look!

292
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:53,055
- Everyone out!
- The hell with cars!

293
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:55,655
- Hug me!
- No, you do it.

294
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:59,653
- Preach it, Texan!
- Yeah, I'll preach!

295
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:02,016
Preach it, brother.

296
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,932
See, I'm preaching!

297
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,738
- Quit it.
- What?

298
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:09,256
- Are you nuts?
- No, I'm the sanest of all.

299
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,855
- Yeah, right.
- It's true, look.

300
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,455
They're sitting
in their boxes driving.

301
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:19,858
Look how many boxes,
an endless line!

302
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:39,810
When'll the effect wear off?

303
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,971
In a while.

304
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,256
You'll be fine tomorrow.

305
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:49,332
What's on your mind?

306
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:51,293
Dunno,

307
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:54,293
there are lots of things
I'd like to do, but...

308
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:56,616
I'll never be able to.

309
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:59,610
You can do anything you want.

310
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:05,494
You can even become
anything you want, if you just...

311
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,692
Decide and...

312
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,614
do it.

313
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:12,693
It's like waiting
for life to start over.

314
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:17,134
A new start, understand?

315
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:20,975
At times I'd like
to step outside of my heart.

316
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:25,698
Take a walk under a starry sky.

317
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:30,218
And listen to nothing but the wind.

318
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:33,691
I'd like to talk
and hear my real voice.

319
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:37,694
- Do you talk with your real voice?
- Dunno.

320
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,653
What is it?

321
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:46,052
When you don't hear any other voices
in your head while talking.

322
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:49,530
You can say what you really want,

323
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:53,538
you don't say things
you're not interested in.

324
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:56,973
Are you sincere with yourself?

325
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,972
Not always.

326
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:05,376
But I am now.

327
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:10,778
Me too.

328
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:20,733
- Hi.
- Where the hell have you been?

329
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,057
I slept at April's.

330
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,536
Hold on, dammit!

331
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,378
Were you with him?

332
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:37,013
I was up all night
worried sick about you.

333
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:40,411
- Your girlfriend didn't comfort you?
- Come here!

334
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:43,413
- I'm not done talking.
- Leave me alone.

335
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:45,173
Come out!

336
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:47,934
- Open the door.
- No way!

337
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:49,977
Open the damn door.

338
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:56,179
We'll discuss this tonight,
make sure you're here when I get back.

339
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:58,092
- Hear me?
- Yes.

340
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:00,296
- What?
- Yes!

341
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:13,933
You have something of mine,
I won't give up easily!

342
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:16,740
If I come in, I'll open fire!

343
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,816
You got some nerve shooting me.

344
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:31,420
Half that stuff's mine,
there's plenty for all!

345
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,571
Knock it off!

346
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,410
Leave me alone, idiot!

347
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:39,415
Mind your business
if you don't want trouble.

348
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:41,810
You have some screws loose!

349
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:46,016
Your greed will be your death,

350
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,773
'cause you...

351
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,773
You are greedy

352
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:54,569
and you'll squeal like a pig
when I come in that door!

353
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,813
Fuck.

354
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:08,818
All this for a few gold nuggets.

355
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:17,778
I bet this is part of human madness.

356
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:36,498
Almost there.

357
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:41,580
- Is that them?
- Sure is.

358
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,058
Like 'em?

359
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:46,733
Good.

360
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,578
Pick one.

361
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,899
Hey there.

362
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,732
Easy...

363
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:57,733
Good boy.

364
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:04,018
Let's go.

365
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,892
What do you think?

366
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,612
It's beautiful.

367
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:39,931
Yeah, it sure is.

368
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:07,535
Do you think things have meaning?

369
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,218
Huh?

370
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:16,054
Do you think everything's destiny
is already...

371
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,612
written?

372
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:21,216
That's an interesting thought.

373
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:23,218
I came here often.

374
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:25,496
I looked at that branch and

375
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:28,056
asked myself if it had a purpose.

376
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:31,452
Maybe it's here...

377
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:34,496
to create shade.

378
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,858
Or maybe...

379
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:40,649
it'll get cut to make furniture
for somebody's home.

380
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:44,416
Maybe it's just here for the swing.

381
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:51,612
Maybe it's just here
to balance the entire tree.

382
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:55,170
I'd opt for the swing idea.

383
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:57,376
It seems like a good idea.

384
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:03,252
And seeing you on it,
I know I'm right.

385
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,936
Can I watch?

386
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:43,974
Sure.

387
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:51,171
Where's your sister?

388
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:52,978
Dunno.

389
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:56,335
Are you still mad at her?

390
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:00,335
I love your sister, it's just that...

391
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:04,736
at times
she makes me lose my patience.

392
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:08,052
What do you like about her?

393
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,052
She's got moxie.

394
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:12,172
What's that?

395
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:13,813
It means...

396
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:18,376
she's got guts,
she's not submissive.

397
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:23,418
This upsets me,
but it's also positive.

398
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:25,616
America's rough on the meek.

399
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,816
But they'll inherit the earth.

400
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:30,858
- What?
- They'll inherit the earth.

401
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:36,257
That's bullshit.

402
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,856
I heard it on TV.

403
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:42,696
The meek may inherit
money from relatives,

404
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,612
but not the earth.

405
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:48,132
The only good thing about the meek
is they make...

406
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:52,213
life easier for those who have moxie.

407
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,416
Can you learn to have it?

408
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:03,013
You either have it or you don't.

409
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:15,454
Stop!

410
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:23,377
Hey Charlie,
you've kept him in good shape.

411
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:26,420
We've been riding him all day.

412
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:31,134
Get off.

413
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:35,251
- What?
- Get off my horse.

414
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:38,140
Am I speaking Arabic, get off!

415
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:43,456
You're scaring my girlfriend.

416
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:47,613
This is my property,
that's my horse,

417
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:52,378
if I decide to shoot you
the law is on my side.

418
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:55,930
- Not so sure about that.
- Get off.

419
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:59,855
Relax, it's a misunderstanding
but we'll resolve it.

420
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:04,252
I don't know
what your friend's thinking

421
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:07,173
but you'd better tell him to get off!

422
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:08,455
Get down.

423
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:12,093
All right.

424
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:17,252
Not for you or your rifle,

425
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:21,417
but 'cause my girl asked me,
and I'd do anything for her.

426
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:24,015
Unlike you Charlie, I have priorities.

427
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:27,377
I don't give a damn
about your priorities.

428
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:30,180
And quit calling me Charlie.

429
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:41,292
I'm rather disappointed,

430
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:44,498
after all our chats, now you embarrass
me in front of my girl?

431
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:48,699
I should kick your ass just for that.
Let's go baby.

432
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:52,376
- You're not going anywhere.
- Put the rifle down!

433
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:56,209
- Put it down.
- They're the thieves.

434
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:59,179
Thanks, officer.
Charlie, are you insane?

435
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:02,651
- Pointing a gun at your friends?
- Calm down.

436
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:07,018
Both of you calm down.
What happened?

437
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:09,376
- He stole my horse.
- Not true.

438
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,258
The horse is here!

439
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:14,253
They came on my property,
stole my horse

440
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,411
and that guy threatened me.

441
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:17,888
What?

442
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:20,893
- Don't you start!
- Calm down.

443
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:23,210
- Where's the horse?
- There.

444
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:26,816
The white one,
they took it without asking.

445
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,618
- From my property.
- Wait!

446
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:32,819
Charlie always lets me use the horses
so long as I bring this.

447
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:35,176
He wasn't here so we took the horse,

448
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:37,376
came back then he attacked me.

449
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:39,338
You think this is the Far West?

450
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:42,014
- This is the valley.
- You're holding the rifle!

451
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:43,898
I don't even know him.

452
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:45,732
He takes medication,

453
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:48,255
this is what happens if he forgets to.

454
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:52,254
- Liar!
- You should take your medication.

455
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:55,651
- My name isn't Charlie!
- Put them in the car.

456
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:03,211
Do you really know Charlie?

457
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,896
Sure, why do you ask?

458
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:10,338
You can tell me if you don't,
it's all right.

459
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:15,816
He keeps insisting
his name isn't Charlie.

460
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:20,019
So? I don't know
if he has a different name,

461
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:22,216
I've always called him Charlie.

462
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:28,052
You mad at me?

463
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:32,773
Shit!

464
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:34,659
Great.

465
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:49,332
I take better care of my animals

466
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:52,014
than you take care of your children.

467
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:53,534
Right.

468
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:56,340
Tell me exactly what happened.

469
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:04,890
Sir, I just want to say that...

470
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:08,216
I know you're upset but...

471
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:11,774
Tobe had nothing to do with it.

472
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:16,250
I take full responsibility
for what happened.

473
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,536
You don't need to apologize.

474
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:23,808
I think it's important to take
responsibility for our own actions.

475
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:27,218
Nothing's more important
than taking responsibility...

476
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:30,213
Not even
involving a minor in a crime?

477
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:33,613
Okay...

478
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:39,817
But this isn't the case
'cause I didn't break the law.

479
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:42,616
It was a misunderstanding.

480
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:46,930
Tobe, tell your friend here...

481
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:51,136
he needs to be more honest
to gain my trust.

482
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:54,213
- I don't care if he has your trust!
- Hey!

483
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:16,975
See you, Lonnie.
Thanks.

484
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:53,778
- Stop!
- Let go!

485
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:56,056
You sit down and talk to me!

486
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:58,609
I don't want to talk to you.

487
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:01,171
- Let go!
- Stop!

488
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:03,694
Fuck you!

489
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:07,491
Don't say that to me, I'm your father.
Understand?

490
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:14,292
I'm her fucking father.

491
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:19,091
If I see you with that psychopath,
I'll kick your ass!

492
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:34,417
Wait, go back in.

493
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:36,890
- Stop it, dammit!
- Let go!

494
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:39,096
Go back in, what are...

495
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:47,856
Sorry.

496
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:51,138
- Please, leave me alone.
- You okay?

497
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:53,735
Get the fuck away!

498
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:22,136
- What are you doing?
- Knocking on your window.

499
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:24,610
- What were you doing?
- Sleeping.

500
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:28,574
What happened to the window?

501
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:32,135
It was an accident.

502
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:35,579
- He didn't hit you, did he?
- No.

503
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:37,970
- You swear?
- Yes.

504
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:40,091
What did he say about me?

505
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:47,812
He just said he never wants me
to see you again.

506
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:57,611
- Do you plan on obeying him?
- No way.

507
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:04,535
Wanna take a walk?

508
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:06,372
I can't.

509
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:09,293
There's a religious parade tonight.

510
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:13,499
Spanish Lutherans,
never seen such enthusiasm.

511
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:15,930
I can't, not tonight.

512
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:18,894
- How about tomorrow?
- I'll be away.

513
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:23,499
I'm going to San Diego for the weekend
with April and her folks.

514
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:26,937
- Can I see you Monday morning?
- Yes, but not here.

515
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:29,455
'Cause of my dad...

516
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:32,692
- I'll come to your place.
- Okay, when?

517
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:35,571
How about 10:02.

518
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:41,092
- Why so late?
- How about 10:01?

519
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:44,212
That's better.

520
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:48,011
Crazy cowboy!

521
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:52,172
You love me?

522
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:56,380
Yes, now go!

523
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:05,138
Bye.

524
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:28,573
Dear Joe,

525
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:33,575
sorry it's been so long
since I've been in touch.

526
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:37,608
You thought this cowboy
had galloped into the afterlife?

527
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:39,816
Hope you haven't forgotten me.

528
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:46,131
I've been meaning to write,

529
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:48,211
but was busy working

530
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:51,816
and trying to have fun
in my free time.

531
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:58,776
I know you worry
about me being lonely

532
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:02,137
but you'll be glad to know
I found a super gal,

533
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:03,859
her name is October.

534
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:07,490
There are 8 million people here,
but she's the one for me.

535
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:10,698
She introduced me to her folks,
I'm like part of the family,

536
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:13,249
we're inseparable now.

537
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:38,010
Hey, it's me, Twig.

538
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:40,693
- What's up?
- Nothing.

539
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:44,816
- Enjoying vacation?
- Yes.

540
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:48,933
- Is Tobe home?
- No.

541
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:55,654
- She's not back from her trip yet?
- Dunno.

542
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:00,936
Wanna wait for her?

543
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:05,773
I was waiting at my place,
she was...

544
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:08,052
supposed to come by but...

545
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:15,492
Well, when she gets back
tell her to come see me.

546
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:17,093
Okay.

547
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:18,898
See you.

548
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:26,772
Wanna see something?

549
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:29,729
Sure.

550
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:34,257
Holy cow, what a collection!

551
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:39,376
Know what this is?

552
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:43,659
- A 1921 Colt Pacemaker.
- Yep, it's his favorite.

553
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:47,252
Amazing!

554
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:52,417
- Ever go shooting with him?
- No.

555
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:56,209
- He says not until I turn 16.
- Really?

556
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:02,329
- Was your dad in the war?
- I think so.

557
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:05,973
Nice.

558
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:09,651
Got plans for today?

559
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:50,618
So if Wade's not your real father,
who is?

560
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:52,373
Dunno.

561
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:56,979
- I never met him.
- So Wade's a father to you?

562
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:02,016
Yeah, he buys us food and everything.

563
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:05,218
It takes more than that
to be a father.

564
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:07,212
Where's yours?

565
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:12,419
He left me and my mom
when I was your age.

566
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:25,576
This is a single action Colt 45.

567
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:29,217
They started making it in 1873.

568
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:31,416
It was never modified.

569
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:33,412
Because it's perfect.

570
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:37,619
All the greats: Wyatt Earp,
Billy the Kid, they all had this gun.

571
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:40,010
Single action

572
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:44,213
means you can pull the trigger
all you want and nothing'll happen.

573
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:46,610
You have to manually cock it to shoot.

574
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:49,738
You have to do it every time,
it's not easy.

575
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:54,371
Great pistoleros had to pull it out,
cock it, and shoot.

576
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:01,575
You get used to it after a while.

577
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:19,410
You want the last two shots?

578
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:24,812
Stand here.

579
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:27,893
When you're ready, cock the hammer

580
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:29,892
and gently pull the trigger.

581
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:32,051
Watch out for the recoil.

582
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:40,894
Don't aim,
point as if it were your finger,

583
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:43,575
as if it were an extension
of your arm.

584
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:55,659
Nice!

585
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:58,133
Great shot!

586
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:54,971
That's my favorite song.

587
00:51:56,860 --> 00:51:59,818
With a little practice,
we'd make a great duo.

588
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:01,812
Tobe's not home.

589
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:04,335
I don't want you
spending time with her.

590
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:08,539
I'd prefer if she says
she doesn't want to see me.

591
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:13,736
I was with Lonnie, anyway.

592
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:17,450
I don't want to see you around here,
the end.

593
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:20,453
I know you're upset
by what happened,

594
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:24,659
I'm sure you consider me
a threat to your daughter.

595
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:26,692
But I'm not.

596
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:29,090
I have only good intentions.

597
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:32,095
Would you accept my apology?

598
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:36,094
You're the dad, I wouldn't
want challenge your authority.

599
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:39,252
- Okay, your name's Harlan?
- Yes.

600
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:41,491
Harlan Fairfax Carruthers.

601
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:46,097
Listen Harlan, I know you,
you can't fool me.

602
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:49,178
How do you know me?

603
00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:51,775
It's my job,
I see guys like you every day.

604
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:53,851
- Like me?
- Yes.

605
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:57,137
- What does that mean?
- Want me to explain?

606
00:52:57,380 --> 00:52:59,610
- Thanks.
- Know what you are?

607
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:04,058
You're trailer trash, a nobody
who wants to become somebody.

608
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:08,851
You pull some stupid stunts
to reach your goal

609
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:10,658
hence, you're dangerous.

610
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:14,256
That's why
I don't want you around my kids.

611
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:16,293
Really...

612
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:21,253
Do you honestly see me like that?

613
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:28,734
- Shut your mouth and go inside.
- He can have his own opinion.

614
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:31,255
- Go in.
- He's my friend, he knows me!

615
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:32,649
Go in!

616
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:35,050
- You can speak your mind.
- Shut up!

617
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:37,097
- Hey.
- Get the fuck inside!

618
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:40,252
Why don't you talk to me,
I'm right here,

619
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:42,809
I'm not a nobody, I'm a person.

620
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:46,575
And I won't leave just 'cause
a son of a bitch tells me to.

621
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:49,653
I know I'm not worth much
but I will fight

622
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:51,572
for my love.

623
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:56,132
Shit.

624
00:53:56,380 --> 00:53:58,894
I'm sorry pal, really.

625
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:02,331
You'd better go.

626
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:04,612
I can't.

627
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:07,338
It's too late.

628
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:09,972
He has a gun!

629
00:54:10,220 --> 00:54:11,892
Okay...

630
00:54:12,220 --> 00:54:14,370
No need to shoot me.

631
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:15,894
Get lost.

632
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:18,973
You're setting a bad example
for that kid.

633
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:24,530
Understand me now?

634
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:30,216
Yes, yes I do.

635
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:33,376
I understand you clearly.

636
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:42,777
- Wanna shoot or want me to leave?
- I want you to go to hell.

637
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:52,297
Okay, put it down,
I'll go.

638
00:55:09,260 --> 00:55:12,536
You're a good kid,
don't let them tell you otherwise.

639
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:24,420
You can't threaten my friends
with a gun!

640
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:27,140
You can't threaten my friends
with a gun!

641
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:28,892
What if he's a pervert?

642
00:55:29,140 --> 00:55:31,529
- You're a fucking bastard.
- How dare you!

643
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:34,533
- I'll tell you off when I please.
- Really!

644
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:39,373
Fuck you.

645
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:42,580
- Let go!
- No, stop it!

646
00:55:42,820 --> 00:55:44,173
Stop it.

647
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:47,093
Knock it off, I said enough!

648
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:49,213
All right.

649
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:51,532
I love him!

650
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:55,178
Why can't you just let me love him?

651
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:53,569
Hi.

652
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:56,695
Where were you? I was worried.

653
00:56:56,940 --> 00:56:58,851
Come sit down.

654
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:04,573
I'm okay.

655
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:09,295
I'm sorry for what he did to you.

656
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:14,894
Yeah...

657
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:16,698
But it's done.

658
00:57:17,580 --> 00:57:19,013
At times...

659
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:21,728
these things helps clarify situations.

660
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:25,939
He said some bullshit,
like you tried to kidnap Lonnie!

661
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:29,815
I didn't believe him, he got pissed.

662
00:57:30,060 --> 00:57:32,733
I brought Lonnie home before sunset.

663
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:36,211
Want a donut or some hot chocolate?

664
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:37,859
Wait.

665
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:42,740
Did you really take Lonnie out?

666
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:47,418
I came to look for you
because I was worried.

667
00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:50,618
Lonnie was at home alone
doing nothing.

668
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:55,053
I felt bad for him
so I took him to the canals to shoot.

669
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:57,416
You took him shooting?

670
00:57:57,780 --> 00:57:59,133
Why?

671
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:02,770
He was all alone,
I felt bad for him.

672
00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:06,569
But you know dad would've gotten mad!

673
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:10,014
Yeah...

674
00:58:13,180 --> 00:58:14,579
But...

675
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:18,815
I thought we'd get back
before him but...

676
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:24,574
You can't behave like that.

677
00:58:25,220 --> 00:58:28,576
Now it'll be even harder
for me to see you.

678
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:35,419
October...

679
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:39,289
are you happy living with Wade?

680
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:46,052
I have to get you out of there.

681
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:47,854
What?

682
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:50,056
I gotta get you and Lonnie
out of there.

683
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:53,451
- We'll go somewhere else.
- Stop this.

684
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:55,691
- Why?
- You have to stay calm!

685
00:58:59,420 --> 00:59:01,172
I am calm.

686
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:08,694
Listen...

687
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:12,655
we can't see each other for a while.

688
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:16,058
- No!
- Until things cool off.

689
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:19,610
- How long will that take?
- I don't know.

690
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:26,690
Where are you going? Don't go!

691
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:31,571
I want to go home.

692
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:35,654
Listen...

693
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:38,653
everything will be fine, okay?

694
00:59:41,220 --> 00:59:43,973
I'll figure something out, I promise.

695
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:21,618
What do you do?
What's your job?

696
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:26,939
I worked...

697
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:30,812
in the...

698
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:33,972
car industry and I'm a fucking cowboy.

699
01:00:34,220 --> 01:00:35,892
What do you do?

700
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:39,735
Fuck, why did I mention the ranches.

701
01:00:51,660 --> 01:00:54,015
The truth is, I'm a Native American.

702
01:00:55,780 --> 01:00:57,532
Yes, an Indian.

703
01:00:58,260 --> 01:01:00,216
The last of the Mohicans.

704
01:01:03,340 --> 01:01:05,092
Why, what's your job?

705
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:09,292
What do you do,

706
01:01:10,820 --> 01:01:12,412
Wade?

707
01:01:14,020 --> 01:01:15,578
Imprisonment?

708
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:18,416
So you're a jailer?

709
01:01:19,620 --> 01:01:22,771
Yes, you're a jailer,
that's what you are.

710
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:26,775
Do you come
from a long line of jailers?

711
01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:29,858
I'm from a long line...

712
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:32,178
of kings...

713
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:35,213
warrior kings, I fucking should be.

714
01:01:38,180 --> 01:01:39,693
See this?

715
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:42,898
It'll look like this
when it flies toward you.

716
01:02:21,460 --> 01:02:23,610
So, who's a nobody now?

717
01:02:32,420 --> 01:02:34,331
Harlan, can I come in?

718
01:02:35,380 --> 01:02:36,733
You here?

719
01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:43,890
- What is it?
- Don't tell me that's a bullet.

720
01:02:45,380 --> 01:02:48,736
- Why I think it is.
- Have you lost your mind?

721
01:02:48,980 --> 01:02:51,733
- You don't shoot windows!
- Go back to your room.

722
01:02:51,980 --> 01:02:55,370
- Why does he have a gun?
- Go to your room!

723
01:02:57,260 --> 01:03:01,412
- Are you nuts?
- I'm sorry, it was an accident.

724
01:03:01,660 --> 01:03:03,412
I don't care.

725
01:03:03,660 --> 01:03:05,491
You know I care for you

726
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:08,971
but you have no respect for me,
so you gotta leave.

727
01:03:09,220 --> 01:03:12,735
Don't talk,
I don't wanna hear your stories,

728
01:03:12,980 --> 01:03:14,891
just pack your bag and go!

729
01:03:23,980 --> 01:03:28,337
- I'm serious.
- I'm getting my stuff, all right?

730
01:04:02,060 --> 01:04:03,573
End of the line.

731
01:04:04,300 --> 01:04:05,858
End of the line,

732
01:04:06,780 --> 01:04:08,099
buddy.

733
01:04:50,140 --> 01:04:52,051
Dear Joe,

734
01:04:53,060 --> 01:04:55,016
isn't life funny?

735
01:05:00,580 --> 01:05:02,616
We all fight furiously,

736
01:05:02,860 --> 01:05:06,409
but we don't even know
what we're looking for.

737
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:14,779
People say all sorts of things
to make you feel better.

738
01:05:16,100 --> 01:05:19,615
I've never heard so much
useless advice.

739
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:28,218
I tried to live in the valley again.

740
01:05:28,460 --> 01:05:30,610
I tried my best this time.

741
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:34,011
I looked everywhere
in search of a sincere face,

742
01:05:34,260 --> 01:05:36,455
but most of the people I met

743
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:39,453
don't even seem human.

744
01:05:47,660 --> 01:05:52,211
I often sensed
something mysterious within me.

745
01:05:52,460 --> 01:05:55,418
I spent years trying to figure out
what it was.

746
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:59,016
Then suddenly, life revealed
my purpose to me.

747
01:05:59,260 --> 01:06:03,617
All the rest seems like an illusion,
like a painted wooden horse.

748
01:06:39,380 --> 01:06:42,895
- Can I help you?
- Maybe, I'm looking for someone.

749
01:06:43,140 --> 01:06:44,573
Who?

750
01:06:45,620 --> 01:06:47,292
A friend...

751
01:06:47,540 --> 01:06:49,735
You're disturbing prayers, leave.

752
01:06:50,180 --> 01:06:51,852
Fine, but...

753
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:56,776
- Leave, you're disturbing us.
- All right, get your hands off.

754
01:06:57,300 --> 01:07:00,258
Don't touch me, brother.
Hands off!

755
01:07:01,620 --> 01:07:04,293
Let go! Stop it!

756
01:07:07,740 --> 01:07:10,732
Let go!
Is this how you treat people?

757
01:07:29,220 --> 01:07:31,131
It's been a long time, Joe.

758
01:07:31,580 --> 01:07:34,731
You're probably surprised
to hear from me.

759
01:07:34,980 --> 01:07:39,531
We wouldn't even
recognize each other if we met.

760
01:07:39,860 --> 01:07:43,819
Maybe it all happened
without us realizing it.

761
01:07:46,620 --> 01:07:49,373
I often wondered why
you did what you did,

762
01:07:49,620 --> 01:07:51,372
why you left us.

763
01:07:51,620 --> 01:07:53,770
I think I know what you were after.

764
01:07:54,940 --> 01:07:59,218
I hope you know, in my own way,
I'm after the same thing.

765
01:08:02,100 --> 01:08:04,455
Hope you are in good health,

766
01:08:04,700 --> 01:08:08,852
though I would've liked to see you
one more time.

767
01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:13,614
The winter rain scattered the smog,

768
01:08:13,860 --> 01:08:17,535
for the first time
I see the path before me.

769
01:08:17,780 --> 01:08:20,135
I'll find greener pastures.

770
01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:22,656
If you happen to think of me,

771
01:08:22,900 --> 01:08:27,052
wish me good luck.
With love, your son.

772
01:09:44,260 --> 01:09:45,818
Hi sweetie.

773
01:09:52,100 --> 01:09:54,853
- What are you doing here?
- How are you?

774
01:09:55,980 --> 01:09:58,653
- Goodness!
- Where were you?

775
01:09:58,900 --> 01:10:01,414
Around, I didn't...

776
01:10:02,020 --> 01:10:04,580
I had some things to do.

777
01:10:05,460 --> 01:10:07,974
I was worried about you.

778
01:10:08,460 --> 01:10:12,612
I thought you didn't want
to see me for a bit, so I...

779
01:10:13,540 --> 01:10:15,292
left you alone.

780
01:10:15,740 --> 01:10:17,696
You shouldn't have disappeared.

781
01:10:18,460 --> 01:10:20,610
I was upset when I said those things.

782
01:10:20,860 --> 01:10:24,409
You sure?
You're not mad at me anymore?

783
01:10:26,300 --> 01:10:28,052
Thank God.

784
01:10:28,660 --> 01:10:30,616
That's all that matters.

785
01:10:31,220 --> 01:10:33,131
So long as we're together.

786
01:10:34,220 --> 01:10:35,892
Are you okay?

787
01:10:36,460 --> 01:10:37,859
Yes, I...

788
01:10:38,620 --> 01:10:40,770
I know I shouldn't be here but...

789
01:10:41,020 --> 01:10:44,933
I needed to see you,
talk to you about some stuff.

790
01:10:46,260 --> 01:10:49,616
- How did you get in?
- I came around the back.

791
01:10:49,860 --> 01:10:51,498
The door was open.

792
01:10:51,740 --> 01:10:56,097
I didn't see your dad's truck,
so I wanted to surprise you.

793
01:10:58,220 --> 01:11:01,053
- Let's go for a walk.
- No, come here.

794
01:11:01,300 --> 01:11:03,973
Come here, we gotta hurry.

795
01:11:17,060 --> 01:11:18,778
What's this?

796
01:11:20,820 --> 01:11:22,492
What do you mean?

797
01:11:23,260 --> 01:11:25,171
Why's my suitcase on the bed?

798
01:11:25,420 --> 01:11:27,297
Because we're leaving.

799
01:11:27,980 --> 01:11:29,652
What?

800
01:11:30,540 --> 01:11:34,135
I told you I'd figure something out,
look...

801
01:11:34,380 --> 01:11:36,769
It took time but I got some money,

802
01:11:37,020 --> 01:11:40,137
we'll live of off it,
we can settle down...

803
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:44,214
take Lonnie in,
or do anything you want.

804
01:11:44,460 --> 01:11:46,212
I put some things in it.

805
01:11:46,460 --> 01:11:49,975
Didn't know what to get, I was so
excited I got 7 of everything.

806
01:11:50,620 --> 01:11:52,451
I didn't find 7 bras though.

807
01:11:52,700 --> 01:11:54,656
But I did get your dress.

808
01:11:54,900 --> 01:11:59,052
I'm sure you'll need other stuff
that I don't know about.

809
01:12:00,340 --> 01:12:02,900
Honey, why that face?

810
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:06,451
My dad will be here soon,
you'd better go.

811
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:08,531
Wait, there's time...

812
01:12:08,780 --> 01:12:11,135
Grab your things, this is our chance.

813
01:12:11,380 --> 01:12:14,895
- Put away the suitcase, please.
- Wait, why?

814
01:12:15,140 --> 01:12:18,894
- My dad will kill me if he sees it.
- Wait, stop!

815
01:12:19,140 --> 01:12:21,700
Relax, we'll be far away
once he notices.

816
01:12:21,940 --> 01:12:25,694
I already told you
I don't want to leave!

817
01:12:30,020 --> 01:12:33,137
That wasn't you talking, I know.

818
01:12:33,380 --> 01:12:36,338
- Then who was it?
- The voice of someone else.

819
01:12:36,580 --> 01:12:38,332
It was your fear talking.

820
01:12:38,580 --> 01:12:40,969
I don't know what you mean,
but you should go.

821
01:12:41,220 --> 01:12:43,176
October, listen! Honey...

822
01:12:43,700 --> 01:12:46,373
I know you're afraid
but this is our chance.

823
01:12:46,620 --> 01:12:49,771
Look inside yourself
and listen to your heart's voice.

824
01:12:50,020 --> 01:12:53,217
This is my heart, this is my voice,
I want you to go!

825
01:12:53,460 --> 01:12:56,213
- Don't shout!
- Well you're not listening to me!

826
01:12:56,460 --> 01:12:59,133
I said you have to go,
what's with you?

827
01:12:59,380 --> 01:13:01,132
What's with you!

828
01:13:25,380 --> 01:13:26,733
Sweetness...

829
01:13:28,660 --> 01:13:30,332
Sweetness, I didn't...

830
01:13:32,380 --> 01:13:34,132
Do you hear me, honey?

831
01:13:34,860 --> 01:13:36,612
Can you hear me?

832
01:13:38,260 --> 01:13:40,012
Keep breathing.

833
01:13:40,260 --> 01:13:42,012
Please keep breathing.

834
01:13:45,940 --> 01:13:47,293
Breathe.

835
01:13:56,260 --> 01:13:58,091
911, can I help you?

836
01:13:58,340 --> 01:14:00,490
Hello? 911 here, hello?

837
01:14:26,220 --> 01:14:27,972
You home?

838
01:14:29,780 --> 01:14:31,133
Tobe?

839
01:14:32,060 --> 01:14:33,413
Lonnie?

840
01:15:00,860 --> 01:15:02,771
Somebody help my daughter!

841
01:15:03,140 --> 01:15:05,495
Somebody help my daughter!

842
01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:19,578
- Do you own other guns?
- Yes, but they're locked up.

843
01:16:19,820 --> 01:16:21,333
Was that one?

844
01:16:22,380 --> 01:16:24,735
He managed to get at it.

845
01:16:24,980 --> 01:16:26,891
But the lock wasn't broken.

846
01:16:27,140 --> 01:16:29,779
Listen, he managed in some way!

847
01:16:30,460 --> 01:16:32,610
Did she say anything?

848
01:16:33,060 --> 01:16:34,209
No.

849
01:16:35,660 --> 01:16:37,218
She'd already...

850
01:16:37,460 --> 01:16:39,416
Iost consciousness.

851
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:41,850
- And your son?
- No.

852
01:16:42,220 --> 01:16:44,131
He wasn't there.

853
01:16:44,380 --> 01:16:47,690
- Does he have access to the guns?
- No way!

854
01:16:48,660 --> 01:16:52,255
- His prints were on the gun.
- What!

855
01:16:52,620 --> 01:16:56,374
- Maybe it was an accident.
- No, it wasn't!

856
01:16:56,620 --> 01:16:58,178
It was...

857
01:16:59,220 --> 01:17:03,577
Nobody's ever seen
that cowboy you mentioned.

858
01:17:20,980 --> 01:17:22,493
Hey, Twig!

859
01:17:28,420 --> 01:17:29,455
Hi.

860
01:17:37,860 --> 01:17:40,215
Tobe got shot.

861
01:17:40,660 --> 01:17:42,412
Yeah, I know.

862
01:17:43,860 --> 01:17:46,294
- I'm wounded too.
- Who did it?

863
01:17:47,140 --> 01:17:49,096
She didn't say anything to anybody?

864
01:17:49,340 --> 01:17:51,092
She's in a coma.

865
01:17:55,660 --> 01:17:57,935
It was Wade.

866
01:17:58,180 --> 01:18:00,535
- Really?
- Yes.

867
01:18:01,220 --> 01:18:02,972
I came to say hello.

868
01:18:03,220 --> 01:18:06,974
I'd decided to leave,
to go away for a while.

869
01:18:07,740 --> 01:18:09,890
She wanted to come with me.

870
01:18:11,300 --> 01:18:14,576
We were talking
and didn't hear him come home.

871
01:18:14,820 --> 01:18:19,018
He shot at me but Tobe
got in the way so it hit her.

872
01:18:19,260 --> 01:18:22,218
She was trying to protect me
and got hit!

873
01:18:24,220 --> 01:18:27,371
How could something like that happen?

874
01:18:27,620 --> 01:18:30,373
He shot at me too but I ran away.

875
01:18:30,620 --> 01:18:32,576
Where did it hit you?

876
01:18:35,860 --> 01:18:39,773
- Does it hurt?
- No, it's just a scratch.

877
01:18:40,740 --> 01:18:42,492
I'll be fine.

878
01:18:42,860 --> 01:18:45,613
My fingerprints were on the gun.

879
01:18:46,460 --> 01:18:49,611
I have to talk
to the Police tomorrow.

880
01:18:55,660 --> 01:18:57,173
Twig...

881
01:18:57,540 --> 01:18:59,496
I want you to listen to me.

882
01:19:00,660 --> 01:19:05,017
It's best if you grab your things
and leave with me now.

883
01:19:05,260 --> 01:19:07,490
- I can't.
- Sure you can.

884
01:19:08,260 --> 01:19:10,216
Sooner or later

885
01:19:10,580 --> 01:19:14,334
the Police will figure out
that your dad did it.

886
01:19:14,580 --> 01:19:17,333
When that happens, they'll arrest him.

887
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:22,095
Then they'll stick you
in a foster home.

888
01:19:22,340 --> 01:19:24,570
- No they won't.
- They will.

889
01:19:25,660 --> 01:19:27,571
It's the truth.

890
01:19:28,700 --> 01:19:31,009
You'll end up in a state orphanage,

891
01:19:32,260 --> 01:19:34,012
do you understand?

892
01:19:36,620 --> 01:19:39,771
It's the worst thing
that could happen to a kid.

893
01:19:40,020 --> 01:19:42,170
I don't want that to happen to you.

894
01:19:43,060 --> 01:19:45,813
If you want,
I'll take you out of here.

895
01:19:46,060 --> 01:19:47,573
We'll hide out for a while.

896
01:19:48,460 --> 01:19:52,135
When Tobe's better
we'll come back to get her.

897
01:19:55,660 --> 01:19:57,616
What do you say, pal?

898
01:19:58,420 --> 01:20:00,411
Wanna come with me?

899
01:20:01,780 --> 01:20:03,099
Yes.

900
01:20:03,660 --> 01:20:05,013
All right.

901
01:20:06,020 --> 01:20:09,376
Then pack a bag
and grab me a blanket,

902
01:20:09,620 --> 01:20:12,088
we'll meet in the alley out back, go.

903
01:21:01,380 --> 01:21:03,132
C'mon champ.

904
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:24,418
Mr. Sommers, she woke up!

905
01:21:32,860 --> 01:21:34,179
Hi.

906
01:21:41,340 --> 01:21:42,659
Hi.

907
01:21:47,620 --> 01:21:49,451
What happened?

908
01:21:52,260 --> 01:21:54,091
You were unconscious.

909
01:21:54,340 --> 01:21:55,693
I feel...

910
01:21:55,940 --> 01:21:57,896
so strange.

911
01:22:06,860 --> 01:22:08,816
Where's Lonnie?

912
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:50,651
This is the highest point
there is around here.

913
01:22:54,860 --> 01:22:56,816
Are you crying, buddy?

914
01:22:57,860 --> 01:22:59,418
Sorry.

915
01:23:03,060 --> 01:23:07,099
Don't say sorry for crying,
it's nothing to be ashamed of.

916
01:23:12,780 --> 01:23:14,691
The only time I don't cry

917
01:23:15,060 --> 01:23:18,211
is in front
of people I consider enemies.

918
01:23:27,220 --> 01:23:29,051
Will Tobe get better?

919
01:23:32,220 --> 01:23:34,370
Is that what you're worried about?

920
01:23:41,460 --> 01:23:43,815
Yes, she sure will get better.

921
01:23:47,460 --> 01:23:50,611
- Did you find him?
- He's not here.

922
01:24:21,020 --> 01:24:23,170
A guy saw him in Santa Clarita.

923
01:24:25,820 --> 01:24:29,176
His real name is Martin Lassen,
he's from Receda.

924
01:24:29,420 --> 01:24:32,378
He spent a year in jail for robbery.

925
01:24:36,020 --> 01:24:37,772
We almost there?

926
01:24:38,620 --> 01:24:39,735
Almost.

927
01:25:05,980 --> 01:25:07,333
Come here,

928
01:25:07,620 --> 01:25:09,770
let me show you something.

929
01:25:10,420 --> 01:25:11,853
What?

930
01:25:13,660 --> 01:25:15,810
C'mon, trust me!

931
01:25:19,700 --> 01:25:21,099
Let's go.

932
01:25:44,260 --> 01:25:46,216
You hold it for a bit.

933
01:25:53,100 --> 01:25:54,613
Where are you going?

934
01:25:55,220 --> 01:25:56,573
Relax!

935
01:25:57,460 --> 01:25:59,416
I'm not going anywhere.

936
01:26:05,980 --> 01:26:07,493
Where are you?

937
01:26:07,820 --> 01:26:09,572
Here with you.

938
01:26:10,220 --> 01:26:12,688
Now try to find your way back.

939
01:26:38,060 --> 01:26:42,212
- What was that?
- An animal that's scared like us.

940
01:26:54,820 --> 01:26:56,378
Don't run.

941
01:26:57,460 --> 01:27:00,418
Move, but not as if you're afraid.

942
01:27:01,060 --> 01:27:04,177
Move like a panther, with courage

943
01:27:04,420 --> 01:27:06,172
and you'll be fine.

944
01:27:11,460 --> 01:27:14,213
- Lonnie!
- Relax!

945
01:27:21,380 --> 01:27:22,813
Down there.

946
01:27:26,100 --> 01:27:28,455
- There he is!
- Stop!

947
01:27:35,260 --> 01:27:37,569
C'mon, hop on Lonnie.

948
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:42,058
Don't shoot!

949
01:28:09,860 --> 01:28:13,409
They'll never find us,
I don't even know where we are.

950
01:29:03,260 --> 01:29:05,012
Where are we?

951
01:29:38,900 --> 01:29:42,176
The horse doesn't like
how I treated him, he's right.

952
01:29:42,420 --> 01:29:44,172
No, he's fine.

953
01:29:53,420 --> 01:29:54,773
Darn.

954
01:30:00,220 --> 01:30:03,132
This isn't exactly how I pictured it.

955
01:30:03,620 --> 01:30:05,531
I'm really sorry.

956
01:30:05,780 --> 01:30:07,691
Don't worry.

957
01:30:08,820 --> 01:30:11,778
When real cowboys used to live here,

958
01:30:12,620 --> 01:30:15,373
they called each other "partner",
it was right.

959
01:30:15,780 --> 01:30:18,340
They were used to sharing everything.

960
01:30:30,660 --> 01:30:32,412
Know what?

961
01:30:42,660 --> 01:30:44,616
We need to get some sleep.

962
01:32:49,020 --> 01:32:52,569
- Music cheers people up.
- Yes, ma'am.

963
01:32:52,820 --> 01:32:56,176
- Don't you agree?
- Yes, a city...

964
01:32:56,420 --> 01:32:58,456
isn't a city without dancing.

965
01:32:58,700 --> 01:33:00,850
Would you care to dance?

966
01:33:03,460 --> 01:33:07,851
I don't reckon I'm worthy
to dance with a lady like you.

967
01:33:08,980 --> 01:33:10,732
But I asked you!

968
01:33:12,660 --> 01:33:15,333
- All right.
- Good, let's dance.

969
01:33:15,580 --> 01:33:17,536
Be right there.

970
01:33:18,060 --> 01:33:20,972
- I believe this is yours.
- Thanks.

971
01:33:24,060 --> 01:33:27,496
Time for our new sheriff
and his lady

972
01:33:27,740 --> 01:33:29,332
to dance!

973
01:33:30,620 --> 01:33:33,771
- Duty calls, see you around.
- Sure thing.

974
01:34:53,820 --> 01:34:55,890
- Stop!
- Take it easy.

975
01:34:56,580 --> 01:34:58,332
You take it easy.

976
01:34:58,900 --> 01:35:01,175
Twig, come here and bring Lightning.

977
01:35:01,420 --> 01:35:02,819
Lonnie, step away.

978
01:35:06,180 --> 01:35:09,855
Wade, take one step near him
and I'll shoot you.

979
01:35:10,220 --> 01:35:12,336
Hold on, nobody hurts anybody.

980
01:35:12,580 --> 01:35:17,210
- Let's put the guns down and talk.
- Put your gun down, now!

981
01:35:17,460 --> 01:35:20,213
Easy, with one finger, slowly.

982
01:35:22,780 --> 01:35:25,692
You too, take off your belt.

983
01:35:26,140 --> 01:35:27,653
Take it off!

984
01:35:34,260 --> 01:35:35,659
Untie the horse.

985
01:35:36,620 --> 01:35:39,692
- He shot Tobe!
- Shut your damn mouth!

986
01:35:39,940 --> 01:35:41,293
The girl's not dead.

987
01:35:41,540 --> 01:35:44,850
Lie all you want,
but we know you shot her.

988
01:35:45,100 --> 01:35:47,773
- You're crazy!
- Even Lonnie knows!

989
01:35:48,020 --> 01:35:50,739
- Nutcase, you lied to my son!
- Harlan!

990
01:36:08,620 --> 01:36:10,815
Come on Lonnie!

991
01:36:15,260 --> 01:36:16,613
Let's go.

992
01:36:39,220 --> 01:36:40,573
Damn!

993
01:36:48,260 --> 01:36:51,377
- You okay?
- Yes, hold this here...

994
01:36:51,620 --> 01:36:53,099
and press hard.

995
01:36:53,700 --> 01:36:55,531
C'mon, keep pressing.

996
01:36:55,780 --> 01:36:57,736
We have to get out of here.

997
01:37:45,540 --> 01:37:48,896
We've gotta move, help me get up.

998
01:37:50,900 --> 01:37:52,333
And Lightning?

999
01:37:52,780 --> 01:37:54,133
Go!

1000
01:38:12,900 --> 01:38:14,413
Stay down.

1001
01:38:19,980 --> 01:38:21,459
Will you be okay?

1002
01:38:21,700 --> 01:38:23,099
Hope so.

1003
01:38:23,340 --> 01:38:25,490
Don't wanna die in a place like this.

1004
01:38:26,580 --> 01:38:28,332
I don't like it one bit.

1005
01:38:40,980 --> 01:38:42,333
Listen,

1006
01:38:42,700 --> 01:38:45,817
stand up and see who's outside.

1007
01:38:49,660 --> 01:38:51,935
- It's Lightning.
- What's he doing?

1008
01:38:52,180 --> 01:38:55,217
- Nothing, just standing there.
- He'll give us away.

1009
01:38:56,300 --> 01:38:59,736
Bring him around back,
put him in the garage.

1010
01:38:59,980 --> 01:39:01,857
Wait, look at me.

1011
01:39:02,220 --> 01:39:04,529
You can do it, go!

1012
01:39:05,060 --> 01:39:07,016
Go, you can do it!

1013
01:39:44,620 --> 01:39:47,976
He was spooked, but he's fine now.

1014
01:40:31,460 --> 01:40:32,495
Stop!

1015
01:40:37,180 --> 01:40:38,738
Don't!

1016
01:40:57,260 --> 01:40:58,932
Stay here.

1017
01:41:03,940 --> 01:41:05,896
Listen, he shot your sister.

1018
01:41:06,500 --> 01:41:08,775
Lonnie, he's the one who shot Tobe.

1019
01:41:09,020 --> 01:41:12,296
- That's not true!
- She'll tell you herself.

1020
01:41:12,540 --> 01:41:14,292
She'll tell you.

1021
01:42:36,860 --> 01:42:38,612
What should we say?

1022
01:42:52,460 --> 01:42:54,291
Nothing,

1023
01:42:57,700 --> 01:42:59,452
just pray for him.
