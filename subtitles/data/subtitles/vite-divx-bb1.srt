00:00:47,956 --> 00:00:49,947
There's this psychiatrist...

3
00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:53,454
...a lady named
Dr. Frances Cress Welsing.

4
00:00:53,661 --> 00:00:57,097
She has a theory
about the black man in America.

5
00:00:57,298 --> 00:01:00,631
She says that because
of the system of racism...

6
00:01:00,902 --> 00:01:05,066
...he's been made
to think of himself as a baby...

7
00:01:05,306 --> 00:01:10,835
...a not-yet fully formed being who
hasn't realized his full potential.

8
00:01:11,479 --> 00:01:14,812
To support her claim,
she offers the following:

9
00:01:17,652 --> 00:01:19,142
First off...

10
00:01:21,155 --> 00:01:24,124
...what does a black man
call his woman?

11
00:01:26,828 --> 00:01:28,159
Mama.

12
00:01:28,663 --> 00:01:33,657
Second, what does a black man
call his closest acquaintances?

13
00:01:35,003 --> 00:01:36,664
His boys.

14
00:01:38,006 --> 00:01:42,943
And finally, what does a black man
call his place of residence?

15
00:01:44,012 --> 00:01:45,673
The crib.

16
00:02:04,032 --> 00:02:05,192
No!

17
00:02:05,533 --> 00:02:08,195
I don't want to lose my baby!

18
00:02:32,393 --> 00:02:33,382
Baby!

19
00:02:39,567 --> 00:02:41,057
Come on, babe.

20
00:02:43,738 --> 00:02:45,069
You all right?

21
00:02:48,443 --> 00:02:50,570
We'll go straight home, okay?

22
00:02:54,749 --> 00:02:56,239
Jody!

23
00:03:00,254 --> 00:03:02,415
Baby, come on.

24
00:03:03,825 --> 00:03:07,488
Just take it easy, okay?
Just get in.

25
00:03:09,931 --> 00:03:11,762
Take it easy, baby.

26
00:03:23,444 --> 00:03:24,775
Baby?

27
00:03:25,947 --> 00:03:27,278
Yvette?

28
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:30,611
You going to sleep?

29
00:03:33,621 --> 00:03:35,282
Are you hungry?

30
00:03:36,457 --> 00:03:41,588
I'll go to Lucy's and get you a cheese
enchilada and a strawberry shake.

31
00:03:41,796 --> 00:03:44,128
That'd make you feel better.

32
00:03:44,966 --> 00:03:47,230
I'm fine, Jody.

33
00:03:49,971 --> 00:03:52,633
You don't need Daddy
to be here for you?

34
00:03:53,641 --> 00:03:56,474
I'm just trying to take care of you.

35
00:03:56,811 --> 00:03:59,473
Seems like you already done that.

36
00:04:00,982 --> 00:04:04,611
Leave me alone, Jody.
Just get out of my face.

37
00:04:13,327 --> 00:04:16,854
Then I guess you don't mind
if I use your car, huh?

38
00:04:17,665 --> 00:04:19,826
Since you're going to sleep.

39
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,430
What's up, little homie?

40
00:04:27,842 --> 00:04:30,003
What's going down with you?

41
00:04:30,511 --> 00:04:32,172
Get the hell home.

42
00:04:43,524 --> 00:04:44,456
Peanut?

43
00:04:47,195 --> 00:04:50,858
Why are you screaming?
I'm hungry. Fix me some food.

44
00:05:17,658 --> 00:05:19,319
You gonna give me some love?

45
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,894
Hey, Ms. Herron.
How's Daddy's little girl doing?

46
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:29,893
Look at you. Suckie-suckie, now.
Come on.

47
00:05:31,405 --> 00:05:33,396
How's Daddy's little baby?

48
00:05:33,741 --> 00:05:37,609
-Jody, you're parked in the driveway.
-Sorry. I'll move it.

49
00:05:37,812 --> 00:05:40,679
Least you can do
is wash mine before you leave.

50
00:05:40,915 --> 00:05:43,748
I got it.
Say, "Daddy got it, Grandma.

51
00:05:44,085 --> 00:05:46,383
Daddy got it all under control."

52
00:05:46,587 --> 00:05:48,487
Look at my pretty baby.

53
00:05:48,689 --> 00:05:52,591
One thing I know how to do
is make some pretty babies.

54
00:05:53,594 --> 00:05:55,926
That's my baby.
That's my little girl.

55
00:05:56,264 --> 00:06:00,200
When will you say "Daddy"?
You want to go to Disneyland?

56
00:06:03,271 --> 00:06:05,102
That's my baby.

57
00:06:07,108 --> 00:06:09,440
Sleep, sleep, sleep.

58
00:06:33,968 --> 00:06:36,232
Go on and pull the damage out.

59
00:07:03,664 --> 00:07:06,132
What you doing to the backyard, Mama?

60
00:07:06,334 --> 00:07:08,666
I told you I was starting a garden.

61
00:07:10,338 --> 00:07:12,602
You've said that for the longest.

62
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:17,471
I must be getting old. I'm doing the
same things I seen my mama do.

63
00:07:17,678 --> 00:07:20,442
I'm planting collards,
mustard greens...

64
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:23,845
...and all this over here
will be my corn.

65
00:07:24,185 --> 00:07:28,053
Tomatoes. Then I'll get
a lace awning at Home Depot...

66
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:33,192
...so I can sit here, tune you out and
sip my wine while my tomatoes grow.

67
00:07:33,527 --> 00:07:38,191
My cabbage is over there.
My beans, onions and sage.

68
00:07:40,534 --> 00:07:41,865
How's Yvette?

69
00:07:42,203 --> 00:07:43,864
She's all right. Sleeping.

70
00:07:44,071 --> 00:07:47,302
I can't give you money
every time you get a girl pregnant.

71
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:49,532
I know, Mama.

72
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:02,712
This is Melvin.
He's helping me with my new garden.

73
00:08:03,057 --> 00:08:05,321
He owns a landscaping business.

74
00:08:05,559 --> 00:08:08,551
Maybe you can work for him
and make some money.

75
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:12,324
Your mama told me you got a problem
finding a job.

76
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,561
I know how that is.

77
00:08:14,902 --> 00:08:18,394
I had that problem too,
before I got my own business.

78
00:08:19,407 --> 00:08:21,739
I'll take these back to the truck.

79
00:08:26,414 --> 00:08:28,075
I'm gonna see you later?

80
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:30,679
I hope so.

81
00:08:43,097 --> 00:08:45,429
So you got a new boyfriend now?

82
00:08:46,934 --> 00:08:49,266
Mama gotta have a life too.

83
00:08:57,378 --> 00:08:59,039
I'm trying to get money.

84
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,078
That's all I'm about. I desire sleep.

85
00:09:02,283 --> 00:09:05,946
-Hey, homie. Want some weed?
-No, man. I'm cool.

86
00:09:08,456 --> 00:09:12,620
I ain't gonna make no money here.
There's too many weed mans.

87
00:09:13,627 --> 00:09:15,618
Let's go holler at these hos.

88
00:09:23,471 --> 00:09:24,961
How's moms doing?

89
00:09:25,306 --> 00:09:29,640
She cool.
I think she got a new boyfriend.

90
00:09:29,977 --> 00:09:32,468
Some old thug-ass nigga.

91
00:09:32,813 --> 00:09:35,145
I know she'll want to kick me out.

92
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:41,144
He'll want to lay up in the house,
move me out so he can get at Mama.

93
00:09:43,891 --> 00:09:47,520
Next thing you know,
he'll be goin' upside her head.

94
00:09:49,163 --> 00:09:50,994
Ain't that the way it go?

95
00:09:51,532 --> 00:09:55,263
Why are you still with him?
You're always at the clinic.

96
00:09:55,503 --> 00:09:59,166
It ain't Jody's fault.
It take two.

97
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,432
I stopped taking my pills.

98
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:04,133
There you go blaming yourself again.

99
00:10:04,345 --> 00:10:08,145
How many times do you call on
the phone about his ass?

100
00:10:08,349 --> 00:10:13,184
Cut him loose. I don't care
if you got a baby. He don't own you.

101
00:10:13,454 --> 00:10:17,914
Look, Jody don't put his hands on me,
no matter how mad he get.

102
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:19,456
He ain't crazy.

103
00:10:19,693 --> 00:10:23,151
Bitch, how long you been with Chris?
Three years?

104
00:10:23,364 --> 00:10:27,357
How many times has that nigga gone
upside your head?

105
00:10:27,701 --> 00:10:29,259
How's your eye feel?

106
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:32,361
It's all right. It's all right.

107
00:10:32,706 --> 00:10:35,539
Shit. At least we living together.

108
00:10:35,743 --> 00:10:39,509
He just want to play with your life
and string you along.

109
00:10:39,713 --> 00:10:43,149
He with his other baby's mama
when he ain't with you.

110
00:10:43,551 --> 00:10:46,213
Please believe. He don't love that ho.

111
00:10:46,554 --> 00:10:50,820
Oh, but he love you, though.
You need to check him.

112
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,890
What's he say about moving in?

113
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,721
Jody wants to live with his mama,
not with me.

114
00:10:57,898 --> 00:11:00,059
Jody, my Jody.

115
00:11:00,401 --> 00:11:04,064
He's a mama's boy.
He'll never leave his mama.

116
00:11:04,405 --> 00:11:09,900
Then let him fuck his mama.
Have her ass up at the clinic. Shit!

117
00:12:11,138 --> 00:12:12,298
I love you, Jody.

118
00:12:12,506 --> 00:12:13,495
I love you too.

119
00:12:14,808 --> 00:12:15,900
I want you to have my baby.

120
00:12:16,143 --> 00:12:17,906
I want to have your baby.

121
00:12:18,145 --> 00:12:19,476
I want to have your baby.

122
00:12:20,981 --> 00:12:21,948
I love you, Jody.

123
00:12:22,149 --> 00:12:23,138
I love you.

124
00:12:23,417 --> 00:12:24,748
I love you too.

125
00:12:24,985 --> 00:12:27,249
I love you, Jody, but you scare me.

126
00:12:27,488 --> 00:12:28,750
You scare me.

127
00:12:52,012 --> 00:12:54,173
No, that's my baby.

128
00:12:57,351 --> 00:12:58,841
Oh, my baby.

129
00:12:59,119 --> 00:13:00,450
Don't cry, Mama.

130
00:13:00,688 --> 00:13:04,681
Give him back!
God, please, give him back!

131
00:13:08,529 --> 00:13:10,190
Jody!

132
00:13:21,542 --> 00:13:24,033
Can I have my car
so I can get to work?

133
00:13:24,311 --> 00:13:25,300
Your car?

134
00:13:25,546 --> 00:13:26,535
My car!

135
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:29,972
Go on with all that, girl.
I'm here asleep.

136
00:13:30,217 --> 00:13:32,310
It's Monday. I can't be late.

137
00:13:32,553 --> 00:13:35,886
Monday? What's that supposed to mean?

138
00:13:36,156 --> 00:13:37,555
Get up!

139
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:40,820
Please be on time.

140
00:13:41,161 --> 00:13:43,493
I'm always on time, Yvette.

141
00:13:43,931 --> 00:13:45,831
Don't have me waiting.

142
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:47,997
Give me some sugar.

143
00:13:56,844 --> 00:13:58,334
-Love you.
-I love you too.

144
00:13:58,612 --> 00:14:00,603
You gonna have a good day?

145
00:14:00,848 --> 00:14:04,181
Be good. Listen to Daddy.
I love you.

146
00:14:04,518 --> 00:14:06,179
Love you too, Mommy.

147
00:14:06,453 --> 00:14:08,114
Thumbs up. My man.

148
00:14:08,789 --> 00:14:10,188
You be good too.

149
00:14:10,524 --> 00:14:13,357
-I'm always good, baby.
-Yeah, right.

150
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:18,725
Come in front, little man.

151
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,861
Young baller, future shot caller.

152
00:14:22,136 --> 00:14:23,967
5:05, Jody. Don't be late.

153
00:14:36,483 --> 00:14:40,044
You want to nod your head too?
That's my boy.

154
00:14:43,157 --> 00:14:45,387
Wait a minute, Jody!
Hold it! Shit!

155
00:14:45,726 --> 00:14:48,388
You got a man out here waiting.

156
00:14:50,731 --> 00:14:52,562
How do I look?

157
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,061
Okay. Where you going?

158
00:14:55,402 --> 00:14:58,838
I don't know. I'm just going.
He asked and I'm going.

159
00:14:59,072 --> 00:15:01,563
Necklace or no necklace?
You don't know.

160
00:15:01,842 --> 00:15:05,005
Why don't you know
where he's taking you?

161
00:15:05,412 --> 00:15:08,745
How'd you know to wear
that tight-ass dress?

162
00:15:09,082 --> 00:15:13,746
This is an all-purpose dress. I am
prepared for anything in this dress.

163
00:15:14,087 --> 00:15:17,853
He likes music, so we're probably
gonna hear music.

164
00:15:18,425 --> 00:15:21,917
You know where he live?
Been to his house yet?

165
00:15:22,429 --> 00:15:26,923
What you know besides him
smiling at you? He could be crazy.

166
00:15:27,267 --> 00:15:29,167
Is he a killer like Henry?

167
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:32,932
Why don't you get an L-7 boyfriend?

168
00:15:33,273 --> 00:15:36,265
A white-collar brother
with a briefcase.

169
00:15:38,111 --> 00:15:40,944
You like them thugs.
I don't know why.

170
00:15:41,281 --> 00:15:45,547
Your daddy was a thug. I need a man
who can handle a woman like me.

171
00:15:45,786 --> 00:15:48,448
He's got to be a thug to handle you?

172
00:15:48,789 --> 00:15:51,781
Melvin's not a thug. He's a nice guy.

173
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:56,892
I'm going out, that's all I know.
That's all I need to know.

174
00:15:57,130 --> 00:16:01,123
I got a date. I look "okay"?
I look good.

175
00:16:12,646 --> 00:16:14,307
What's up, man?

176
00:16:19,319 --> 00:16:21,150
Them's some nice shoes.

177
00:16:21,488 --> 00:16:22,648
Stacey Adams.

178
00:16:22,923 --> 00:16:24,754
Stacey Adams, huh?

179
00:16:25,158 --> 00:16:26,489
OG style.

180
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:31,320
So where y'all going?

181
00:16:31,598 --> 00:16:35,728
I'm taking her to a club on Crenshaw,
listen to some music.

182
00:16:35,936 --> 00:16:37,597
My partner's in a band there.

183
00:16:37,838 --> 00:16:42,468
That's good. That's real good.
My mama likes to dance.

184
00:16:42,843 --> 00:16:45,141
I asked 'cause I just met you...

185
00:16:45,345 --> 00:16:48,906
...and I didn't want to
chaperon you old folks.

186
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:57,621
That's my brother, Ray.

187
00:16:58,025 --> 00:17:02,291
He lived here until Mama kicked
him out over her last boyfriend.

188
00:17:04,531 --> 00:17:05,793
He dead now.

189
00:17:07,367 --> 00:17:09,028
My brother, I mean.

190
00:17:11,204 --> 00:17:13,195
So where you live, man?

191
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:15,702
I live in Inglewood.

192
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:21,378
I grew up on 101st and Vermont.
The Hoovers.

193
00:17:23,717 --> 00:17:26,049
That was a long time ago.

194
00:17:26,553 --> 00:17:28,214
I was young...

195
00:17:29,222 --> 00:17:30,314
...and dumb.

196
00:17:32,726 --> 00:17:35,217
Jody, are you messin' with my date?

197
00:17:35,562 --> 00:17:39,054
No, I'm keeping him company.
Playing the host.

198
00:17:39,399 --> 00:17:43,233
Nobody likes sitting up here,
waiting alone.

199
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:47,339
Why can't women be ready on time?
They always make us wait.

200
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:49,236
Whatever, Jody.

201
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,480
All right, y'all have a good time.

202
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:05,248
Mama, remember your curfew.

203
00:18:08,428 --> 00:18:11,158
You need money?
I got some change for you.

204
00:18:11,365 --> 00:18:13,390
Jody, you ain't got no money.

205
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,764
Bring me back a Fatburger,
on the real, little cheese.

206
00:18:18,105 --> 00:18:19,766
Go in the house!

207
00:18:21,274 --> 00:18:23,606
You be careful with my mama, man.

208
00:18:29,783 --> 00:18:33,776
Got that pure cake.
No butter, no sugar.

209
00:18:34,121 --> 00:18:37,454
Straight, like my brother's soul.
We got pound cake.

210
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:40,760
-Give me some pound cake.
-Here you go, brother.

211
00:18:40,961 --> 00:18:43,623
Thank you, brother.
Have a good day.

212
00:18:49,803 --> 00:18:52,135
Today I begin a new life.

213
00:18:52,806 --> 00:18:55,138
I am the master of my abilities...

214
00:18:55,475 --> 00:18:58,808
...and today will be a great
and beautiful day.

215
00:18:59,146 --> 00:19:00,306
What?

216
00:19:01,815 --> 00:19:05,080
I said, today I begin a new life.

217
00:19:05,485 --> 00:19:07,646
I am the master of my abilities...

218
00:19:07,988 --> 00:19:10,980
...and today will be a great
and beautiful day.

219
00:19:11,324 --> 00:19:14,316
Pillows, pillows. Goose down, $35.

220
00:19:18,999 --> 00:19:21,160
Pea, are you a buyer or a seller?

221
00:19:21,501 --> 00:19:22,490
What?

222
00:19:22,836 --> 00:19:24,827
Videos, homie. Videos.

223
00:19:25,172 --> 00:19:28,505
DVD, CDs, Master P,
Charlie's Angels.

224
00:19:34,181 --> 00:19:35,842
Look at yourself.

225
00:19:37,184 --> 00:19:39,448
How many millionaires you got on?

226
00:19:40,187 --> 00:19:42,178
I count at least three.

227
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:45,181
What are you talking about?

228
00:19:45,525 --> 00:19:48,358
Pea! Look around, man.

229
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:53,363
You see what I see? I see money.

230
00:19:54,701 --> 00:19:57,431
Look at my man there selling T-shirts.

231
00:19:57,637 --> 00:20:02,074
A brother selling pies and papers.
Cake Man over there.

232
00:20:02,542 --> 00:20:05,875
Everybody moving, making money, right?

233
00:20:06,213 --> 00:20:09,239
While we standing still, being broke.

234
00:20:10,717 --> 00:20:14,050
I figured all this shit out, man.
All this.

235
00:20:14,554 --> 00:20:17,887
The world moves forward
through transactions.

236
00:20:18,225 --> 00:20:19,886
Commerce, nigga.

237
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,892
The exchange of goods and services.

238
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:27,394
All the real ballin',
successful folks are sellers.

239
00:20:27,901 --> 00:20:31,393
All the broke people playing
catch-up are buyers.

240
00:20:32,739 --> 00:20:37,369
I ain't trying to go out like that.
I'm gonna be a seller.

241
00:20:39,246 --> 00:20:41,578
I'm gonna get my own business.

242
00:20:42,582 --> 00:20:44,573
Change the game.

243
00:20:45,085 --> 00:20:46,916
You want to sell clothes?

244
00:20:47,187 --> 00:20:51,851
Like the man who came to the phone
company selling dresses. Remember?

245
00:20:52,092 --> 00:20:53,081
Cute ass.

246
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,523
-Women's or men's clothes?
-Women's.

247
00:20:56,763 --> 00:20:59,163
Women buy clothes every other day.

248
00:20:59,366 --> 00:21:01,766
But you need to know about women.

249
00:21:02,035 --> 00:21:03,866
I know all about females.

250
00:21:04,104 --> 00:21:05,435
You hear your son?

251
00:21:05,705 --> 00:21:07,764
-You're a bad boy.
-Believe me.

252
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:11,442
Are you trying to be a salesman
or a shyster?

253
00:21:11,711 --> 00:21:14,874
You buy from a shyster,
you feel like you got took.

254
00:21:15,115 --> 00:21:18,107
You buy from a good salesman
and you feel lucky.

255
00:21:18,385 --> 00:21:20,876
A good salesman makes you
feel so good...

256
00:21:21,121 --> 00:21:24,613
...you'll go back again to give
more and more money.

257
00:21:24,891 --> 00:21:26,449
That sounds like sex.

258
00:21:26,793 --> 00:21:29,284
-What else should I know?
-Sizes.

259
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:32,329
You gotta know a woman's size
on sight.

260
00:21:32,532 --> 00:21:35,433
Don't wait for her to tell you.
Just know.

261
00:21:35,635 --> 00:21:39,696
-Compliment them, even if they ugly.
-Especially if they are.

262
00:21:39,906 --> 00:21:41,897
-Like Bernice.
-She's big.

263
00:21:42,142 --> 00:21:44,133
They'll be your regulars.

264
00:21:44,411 --> 00:21:48,074
You need to know her favorite
color, what's in season....

265
00:21:48,315 --> 00:21:51,079
And fabrics.
How it feels on our skin.

266
00:21:51,651 --> 00:21:53,642
What's an average size?

267
00:21:53,987 --> 00:21:56,387
I'm a size 5-6. That's average.

268
00:21:56,656 --> 00:21:58,988
For who? A white girl?

269
00:21:59,326 --> 00:22:03,160
Jody, I'm a size 1 6
and that's average too.

270
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:07,093
-Remember that, you'll make money.
-It's best on payday.

271
00:22:15,675 --> 00:22:17,006
Rachel?

272
00:22:18,678 --> 00:22:21,670
My name is Joseph Summers.
My friends call me Jody.

273
00:22:22,015 --> 00:22:24,347
You want to be my friend?

274
00:22:25,185 --> 00:22:28,177
I wonder if I could
talk to your customers...

275
00:22:28,455 --> 00:22:30,787
...show them my merchandise.

276
00:22:31,024 --> 00:22:35,893
I didn't want to come in and talk
to people without your blessing.

277
00:22:36,096 --> 00:22:37,222
What you selling?

278
00:22:38,365 --> 00:22:41,357
You see this? That's your color.

279
00:22:42,035 --> 00:22:45,869
You're an earth-tone woman.
It match your hair.

280
00:22:46,206 --> 00:22:49,767
Feel how soft that is right there.
See that?

281
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:52,701
See? See how soft that is?

282
00:22:53,046 --> 00:22:55,173
This is from Paris, France.

283
00:22:55,382 --> 00:22:58,317
You'll change the game with this.
It's couture.

284
00:22:59,552 --> 00:23:03,886
Girl, that's polyester blend.
You pop it in the dryer and go.

285
00:23:04,224 --> 00:23:06,215
This dress is perfect for you.

286
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:10,051
It's an all-purpose style.
All-purpose dress.

287
00:23:10,397 --> 00:23:12,228
You know what that means?

288
00:23:12,565 --> 00:23:15,659
You can wear it to work,
go straight to happy hour.

289
00:23:15,902 --> 00:23:19,235
Them pants got happy hour
written all over them.

290
00:23:20,073 --> 00:23:23,565
Baby, I ain't gonna lie to you.

291
00:23:24,077 --> 00:23:27,410
Them is one of a kind. Explosive!

292
00:23:28,081 --> 00:23:31,573
You see anyone with them pants on,
you can come bite me.

293
00:23:31,851 --> 00:23:33,512
It ain't happening.

294
00:23:35,588 --> 00:23:36,919
How much?

295
00:23:37,924 --> 00:23:39,687
I'll let it go for $40.

296
00:23:39,926 --> 00:23:41,587
Forty dollars?!

297
00:23:42,762 --> 00:23:47,256
Look, $35. That's the lowest I can go.
You're killing me.

298
00:23:48,601 --> 00:23:50,262
Okay, 35.

299
00:23:53,773 --> 00:23:57,436
Thank you.
I'll squeeze my tiny ass in this...

300
00:23:57,777 --> 00:24:01,645
...and upstage these bitches in here.
You like it? Cute.

301
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:04,781
One...

302
00:24:05,118 --> 00:24:06,949
...two hundred, three....

303
00:24:07,287 --> 00:24:09,278
That's four hundred dollars!

304
00:24:09,622 --> 00:24:11,954
That is crazy!

305
00:24:18,631 --> 00:24:23,295
Lord, that's crazy.
That is crazy. Okay.

306
00:24:48,161 --> 00:24:49,492
Come on, dog.

307
00:24:59,005 --> 00:25:00,666
I like!

308
00:25:03,777 --> 00:25:06,837
It look good.
Your mama look fly, don't she?

309
00:25:07,514 --> 00:25:09,004
Your mama look good?

310
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:12,816
-I got another surprise.
-What?

311
00:25:13,019 --> 00:25:18,013
That beautiful dress, my son looking
nice.... We're doing big things!

312
00:25:18,358 --> 00:25:20,019
What'd you do to my car?

313
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,851
I got them tinted windows done.

314
00:25:23,196 --> 00:25:26,188
I got some 1 0s from my Mexican homies.

315
00:25:35,041 --> 00:25:38,374
I told you she'd like that.
Daddy got taste.

316
00:25:59,065 --> 00:26:00,293
Want some breakfast?

317
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:40,762
--I learned so many
incredible secrets.

318
00:26:41,107 --> 00:26:43,268
When placing ads in newspapers...

319
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:47,944
...just one secret I can show you
can make you a fortune.

320
00:26:48,281 --> 00:26:51,273
Nice, huh? State of the art.

321
00:26:52,619 --> 00:26:54,610
Yeah. This is the bomb.

322
00:26:55,555 --> 00:27:00,219
-Mama didn't say she got a new TV.
-She didn't know. It's a surprise.

323
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,791
Oh, yeah?

324
00:27:02,795 --> 00:27:06,128
I have to hook up the VCR
and set the timer...

325
00:27:06,466 --> 00:27:08,127
...so she can see--

326
00:27:08,401 --> 00:27:13,134
I hooked it up and set it already.
Pass the remote, youngster.

327
00:27:13,473 --> 00:27:15,304
Let me show you how it works.

328
00:27:16,809 --> 00:27:20,301
I got this bad boy
from my man for free.

329
00:27:20,647 --> 00:27:25,482
You know how much it costs
in one of them electronic stores?

330
00:27:25,818 --> 00:27:28,651
-It cost a grip.
-You got that right.

331
00:27:28,988 --> 00:27:32,651
But we black folks
live by the barter system.

332
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:35,085
You know about that?

333
00:27:35,328 --> 00:27:39,594
When black folks had no money,
we traded for things.

334
00:27:39,799 --> 00:27:44,327
My man give me this TV 'cause I did
some work for him back in the day.

335
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:49,474
You know, shot a couple niggas,
cut up some folk. Dumb shit.

336
00:27:49,676 --> 00:27:54,511
I was like you, Jody.
Young, dumb and out of control.

337
00:27:55,014 --> 00:27:57,005
I did a dime.

338
00:27:57,350 --> 00:28:00,683
Ten years straight
in San Quentin and Folsom.

339
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:04,478
All over some dumb shit. But you?

340
00:28:04,757 --> 00:28:07,590
You're smarter than I was at your age.

341
00:28:07,794 --> 00:28:10,991
I gotta hand it to you.
You're smart.

342
00:28:11,197 --> 00:28:13,859
You're no killer like me. That's good.

343
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:17,036
I was bad.
I ain't had my dome straight.

344
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:20,603
But, Jody, peep this. On the real.

345
00:28:21,608 --> 00:28:25,271
Me and your mama
are getting real serious...

346
00:28:25,945 --> 00:28:29,437
...so I'm gonna be
around here for a while.

347
00:28:29,949 --> 00:28:35,114
I ain't trying to be your daddy
or nothing, but if you need advice...

348
00:28:36,222 --> 00:28:38,213
...feel free to talk to me.

349
00:28:38,791 --> 00:28:40,952
'Cause I seen it all...

350
00:28:41,461 --> 00:28:43,793
...and I done it all to the full.

351
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:48,294
You may think you see new shit
out here, but it's just...

352
00:28:48,501 --> 00:28:50,298
...a rerun to me.

353
00:28:53,306 --> 00:28:55,274
You know what I'm saying?

354
00:29:21,834 --> 00:29:22,823
Mama?

355
00:29:23,169 --> 00:29:28,163
Mama, have you got this nigga
living up in here now?

356
00:29:28,441 --> 00:29:31,103
-Can't I have a life?
-You got a life!

357
00:29:31,344 --> 00:29:36,338
Them days are over. I ain't
like Big Mama. I got to have fun.

358
00:29:36,683 --> 00:29:39,015
You have fun. Why can't l?

359
00:29:39,218 --> 00:29:42,346
But why does the man
have to live here?

360
00:29:42,689 --> 00:29:46,591
He a killer,
and you got him in the kitchen...

361
00:29:46,793 --> 00:29:49,819
...scrambling eggs
and drinking the Kool-Aid?

362
00:29:50,029 --> 00:29:51,860
He was making me breakfast!

363
00:29:52,198 --> 00:29:53,358
All right.

364
00:29:55,368 --> 00:29:59,668
What am I supposed to do?
Roll over and die?

365
00:29:59,872 --> 00:30:01,305
You gonna kick me out?

366
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:04,333
You gonna kick me out?

367
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:08,173
Let me know now.
I don't need no surprises.

368
00:30:08,381 --> 00:30:10,849
I do. Surprise me and move out.

369
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:14,987
You could learn from Melvin.

370
00:30:15,321 --> 00:30:20,349
He's done well for himself.
He's turned his life around.

371
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:25,657
He has his own business. I don't have
to force him to get a job!

372
00:30:31,404 --> 00:30:35,363
You're not a baby no more, Jody.
You need to grow up.

373
00:30:35,575 --> 00:30:40,911
You got your own family. Why don't you
and Yvette get a place together?

374
00:30:44,584 --> 00:30:49,248
Why are you so afraid to grow up
and be a man? Leave the nest.

375
00:30:49,589 --> 00:30:51,420
I am a man.

376
00:30:56,262 --> 00:30:58,162
So you're kicking me out?

377
00:30:58,765 --> 00:31:03,759
What for? To be with this nigga?
You don't even know him.

378
00:31:04,771 --> 00:31:09,902
What do you mean, "leave the nest"?
You didn't! This is Grandma's house!

379
00:31:10,109 --> 00:31:12,942
I don't have to leave
if you never did!

380
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:15,839
What are you talking about?

381
00:31:17,116 --> 00:31:18,708
Mama needs a life too.

382
00:31:18,951 --> 00:31:20,612
Fuck you, bro.

383
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:23,552
Can you tell your son something?

384
00:31:23,823 --> 00:31:25,984
No, I'm not in it.

385
00:31:26,225 --> 00:31:31,219
But why he do the things he do,
Miss Juanita? You must know.

386
00:31:31,564 --> 00:31:36,058
I don't know what to do.
I love him, but how much can I take?

387
00:31:36,402 --> 00:31:37,960
I can't believe this!

388
00:31:38,171 --> 00:31:41,299
I told you, I won't be
in y'all's business.

389
00:31:41,507 --> 00:31:45,500
What's between you and Jody
is you and Jody.

390
00:31:45,845 --> 00:31:48,507
What do I do with his selfish ass?

391
00:31:48,848 --> 00:31:52,648
He got me and his son walking
while he rolling in my car.

392
00:31:52,852 --> 00:31:57,687
The car I'm paying the note on.
Man, I feel so stupid.

393
00:31:58,858 --> 00:32:00,849
You ain't stupid, Yvette.

394
00:32:02,862 --> 00:32:05,353
You're just in love with a man.

395
00:32:10,703 --> 00:32:15,333
When you in love with a man,
he can make you feel high.

396
00:32:15,541 --> 00:32:18,704
So high you just be in outer space.

397
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:24,178
But he can also make you feel low.

398
00:32:25,218 --> 00:32:28,051
Real low. And he can keep you there.

399
00:32:28,387 --> 00:32:29,718
Keep you down.

400
00:32:30,223 --> 00:32:31,884
If you let him.

401
00:32:32,558 --> 00:32:36,892
But don't even worry about feeling
used. It's just temporary.

402
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:40,358
We all get used.
Men use women, women use men.

403
00:32:40,566 --> 00:32:43,034
Just accept that you'll be used.

404
00:32:43,236 --> 00:32:46,694
But if you feel so used
that you got nothing left...

405
00:32:46,906 --> 00:32:51,240
...if the man ain't giving you
the energy you need to love him...

406
00:32:51,577 --> 00:32:55,536
...even when he's acting
like a bastard, you need to let go.

407
00:32:55,748 --> 00:32:59,741
If you ain't got nothing to give
yourself or your baby...

408
00:33:00,086 --> 00:33:02,919
...you won't have it to give to him.

409
00:33:08,261 --> 00:33:10,092
Good boy. Now the corn.

410
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:13,355
Did you finish the tomatoes?
There you go.

411
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:16,591
Thattaboy. A little more water
on the greens.

412
00:33:16,936 --> 00:33:19,598
Hi, Juanita. Where's my baby?

413
00:33:24,944 --> 00:33:26,775
Hey, Mama.

414
00:33:38,791 --> 00:33:42,659
Bring my grandbaby here
so I can kiss her goodbye.

415
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:45,620
Bye, sweetness.

416
00:33:45,965 --> 00:33:47,626
Be a good girl.

417
00:33:53,973 --> 00:33:55,634
Ooh, Melvin!

418
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:58,971
Oh, baby.

419
00:33:59,612 --> 00:34:03,810
-You gonna give me a cavity.
-Oh, yes, baby. Melvin!

420
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:06,641
Okay, circles. Around and around.

421
00:34:06,986 --> 00:34:09,318
Take it, take it. You ride.

422
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:11,079
I love to ride!

423
00:34:12,725 --> 00:34:16,684
It's the African squat fuck.
The old nigger squat fuck.

424
00:34:21,334 --> 00:34:23,325
Squat, baby. Squat, baby.

425
00:34:23,669 --> 00:34:27,332
Can y'all keep it down?
People are trying to sleep!

426
00:34:27,673 --> 00:34:29,004
Let me down, baby.

427
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:30,435
Fuck!

428
00:34:30,776 --> 00:34:34,337
--and that she was impressed.
Broke her off.

429
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,671
Made her feel good.

430
00:34:37,016 --> 00:34:39,678
Now I got myself a regular customer.

431
00:34:47,026 --> 00:34:49,358
What the hell is he looking at?

432
00:34:50,696 --> 00:34:55,998
Trying to psych me out, talking about
being a killer. Old-school nigga.

433
00:34:56,202 --> 00:35:00,195
He don't want us to have
to put heat on his ass, do he?

434
00:35:00,539 --> 00:35:02,302
Want me to take him out?

435
00:35:04,043 --> 00:35:05,874
Let the nigga breathe.

436
00:35:07,213 --> 00:35:11,877
He make my mama unhappy, we make
his ass bleed. On the real.

437
00:35:12,218 --> 00:35:17,520
Make him feel the steel.
Long as she happy, he got his life.

438
00:35:17,723 --> 00:35:19,384
Won't be no strife.

439
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:23,221
And I hope his ass hear me too.

440
00:35:25,064 --> 00:35:26,554
I hear you.

441
00:35:29,235 --> 00:35:31,499
You know your problem?

442
00:35:31,904 --> 00:35:36,773
You think you know everything,
but you don't know shit.

443
00:35:37,576 --> 00:35:41,910
I see you got a little business
going. Well, that's good.

444
00:35:42,248 --> 00:35:44,239
You make that paper.

445
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:48,214
But when you making paper,
there's rules that go with it.

446
00:35:48,421 --> 00:35:52,755
You gotta learn the difference
between guns and butter.

447
00:35:53,926 --> 00:35:59,262
There are two types of niggas. Those
with guns, and those with butter.

448
00:35:59,765 --> 00:36:04,259
What are the guns?
That's the real estate.

449
00:36:04,603 --> 00:36:07,595
The stocks and bonds. Art work.

450
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:10,773
Shit that appreciates in value.

451
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:12,771
What's the butter?

452
00:36:13,112 --> 00:36:18,744
Cars, clothes, all the other bullshit
that don't mean shit later.

453
00:36:18,951 --> 00:36:22,546
That's what it's all about.
Guns and butter.

454
00:36:22,788 --> 00:36:25,279
You little dumb motherfuckers.

455
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:33,360
See what I'm sayin', cuz?

456
00:36:33,966 --> 00:36:37,129
This nigga doing this shit
every night.

457
00:36:37,536 --> 00:36:38,901
What?

458
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:45,404
Why can't you just
sit still and relax?

459
00:36:45,611 --> 00:36:47,480
Don't complain.
You left me here all weekend!

460
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,674
Don't complain.
You left me here all weekend!

461
00:36:48,881 --> 00:36:50,815
Why can't you sit still?

462
00:36:51,016 --> 00:36:54,110
That's what divides us
as a people. No focus.

463
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:59,087
Why don't you sit down and focus?
Watch some PBS or something.

464
00:36:59,291 --> 00:37:03,193
You so full of shit.
So fucking selfish.

465
00:37:03,395 --> 00:37:04,919
What's this old pizza?

466
00:37:05,164 --> 00:37:09,999
Since you're starting shit,
where you been since yesterday?

467
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:14,002
Slinging dresses, making money.

468
00:37:14,507 --> 00:37:17,635
Got the brakes fixed.
What you been doing?

469
00:37:17,843 --> 00:37:20,004
-You been fucking around?
-Nope.

470
00:37:20,212 --> 00:37:22,043
Let me smell your dick.

471
00:37:22,515 --> 00:37:23,948
Go on with that.

472
00:37:24,183 --> 00:37:29,018
If you ain't been whoring around,
let me smell your dick. I can tell.

473
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:30,277
Go on.

474
00:37:30,523 --> 00:37:35,017
I ain't playing with you. Move!
I'll knock your ass out.

475
00:37:39,031 --> 00:37:41,693
See? My shit smells good, don't it?

476
00:37:42,034 --> 00:37:45,561
See what? You probably washed it off.

477
00:37:48,207 --> 00:37:51,074
I'm tired of you messing around on me.

478
00:37:51,877 --> 00:37:55,278
I know you and Sweetpea was out
doing me wrong.

479
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:57,005
I didn't do nothing.

480
00:37:57,216 --> 00:38:01,983
You gonna sit there with
a straight face and say that?

481
00:38:02,721 --> 00:38:07,215
I didn't do nothing.
I was over at Kim's, playing spades.

482
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:11,394
You're a liar!
You went to that after-hours spot.

483
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:15,723
Some nasty heifer was
shaking her ass in your face...

484
00:38:15,935 --> 00:38:19,336
...then you went to a private room
with the bitch...

485
00:38:19,538 --> 00:38:21,369
...and did I don't know what!

486
00:38:21,574 --> 00:38:26,477
I know 'cause Chris was there.
Sharika's Chris? He saw you.

487
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:30,911
You busted.
It's all on your grill, stupid.

488
00:38:32,418 --> 00:38:33,680
All right.

489
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:37,412
I was there. But I didn't fuck.

490
00:38:37,923 --> 00:38:40,824
She just danced for me, that's all.

491
00:38:41,026 --> 00:38:45,326
-Did you touch her?
-Hell, no. That nasty girl?

492
00:38:45,764 --> 00:38:50,098
We can't touch them anyway.
It's against the rules.

493
00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:55,467
Private dance, that's all.
Just a quick lap dance.

494
00:38:57,109 --> 00:39:00,772
You don't believe me?
It's the truth. I didn't fuck!

495
00:39:01,113 --> 00:39:05,311
It was a private dance, in the corner.
I didn't do shit.

496
00:39:05,517 --> 00:39:08,486
You must take me
for some kind of fool.

497
00:39:08,854 --> 00:39:12,449
You foul. I smell
your dirty ass from here.

498
00:39:12,691 --> 00:39:15,592
Why you got to be around
them nasty girls?

499
00:39:15,794 --> 00:39:18,786
They do that shit every night, dummy.

500
00:39:19,031 --> 00:39:22,023
You know how many dicks
they suck every night?

501
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:26,532
And you go down there like
the rest of them fools!

502
00:39:27,139 --> 00:39:30,597
You better not bring me nothing
from them bitches.

503
00:39:30,809 --> 00:39:33,004
Fuck it then! Don't believe me.

504
00:39:33,212 --> 00:39:37,512
I said I didn't fuck that girl.
Stop putting your hands on me.

505
00:39:37,716 --> 00:39:38,944
Where you going?!

506
00:39:39,385 --> 00:39:43,219
I hate you!
You're selfish, arrogant and stupid!

507
00:39:43,555 --> 00:39:46,023
-Whatever.
-I don't need you!

508
00:39:46,225 --> 00:39:50,491
I'm tired of sitting here,
not having a man with me.

509
00:39:50,696 --> 00:39:54,689
Being lonely. I'm gonna do
what the fuck I wanna do.

510
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,891
What are you gonna do?

511
00:39:57,236 --> 00:40:01,195
I said I'm tired of waiting
for your ass. I hate you.

512
00:40:01,407 --> 00:40:03,068
I'm gonna have me a man.

513
00:40:03,409 --> 00:40:06,537
A man who wants to be with me
and my baby...

514
00:40:06,745 --> 00:40:09,873
...and have a family.
A real man, Jody.

515
00:40:10,082 --> 00:40:13,882
Not some little boy, still living
at home with his mama.

516
00:40:14,086 --> 00:40:16,077
Fuck you! Kiss my ass!

517
00:40:16,422 --> 00:40:21,553
Go out on the streets and be a trick.
I should knock you the fuck out.

518
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,218
You better not, or I'll call your
probation officer...

519
00:40:25,431 --> 00:40:29,265
...and they'll put you
back in jail! Now....

520
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:31,561
Kiss my ass, nigga!

521
00:40:31,904 --> 00:40:36,102
You better walk away. I hate you!
You so stupid!

522
00:40:36,575 --> 00:40:39,271
You hate me? Keep on saying that shit.

523
00:40:39,478 --> 00:40:42,606
That's right. I hate your ass.

524
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:46,444
You make me sick.
I can't stand your black ass!

525
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:50,649
You act like a little boy
instead of a grown man.

526
00:40:50,856 --> 00:40:52,153
I hate you!

527
00:40:52,358 --> 00:40:56,294
You know what? I hate your ass too.
Do something.

528
00:40:59,331 --> 00:41:02,061
Give me my keys. You ain't going--

529
00:41:02,267 --> 00:41:05,634
Get off me! There you go,
coming downstairs...

530
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:08,830
...showing off before the neighbors.

531
00:41:09,041 --> 00:41:12,204
-Fuck them! I hate you!
-I hate you too!

532
00:41:12,411 --> 00:41:15,073
I love you! I love you so much!

533
00:41:15,414 --> 00:41:18,110
I love you too. I ain't going nowhere.

534
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:22,848
-You feel him?
-Yes, I feel him.

535
00:41:23,088 --> 00:41:24,248
You feel him?

536
00:41:24,523 --> 00:41:27,014
Oh, my God, I feel him! He big!

537
00:41:27,259 --> 00:41:29,250
-What do you feel?
-Daddy Dick.

538
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:31,723
-You love Daddy Dick?
-I love him.

539
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:34,228
-You say it.
-I love Daddy Dick.

540
00:41:34,433 --> 00:41:36,833
You gonna clean all that mess up?

541
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:40,233
-I'll clean up!
-You gonna cook some tacos?

542
00:41:40,439 --> 00:41:43,602
My God! I'm about to come.
I'm gonna come!

543
00:41:44,276 --> 00:41:45,971
Yes, I'll make the tacos!

544
00:41:50,949 --> 00:41:52,780
Oh, my God....

545
00:41:53,952 --> 00:41:55,886
I could bite you right now.

546
00:41:56,622 --> 00:41:58,283
Damn, boy. Shit!

547
00:41:58,624 --> 00:42:00,285
Now what?

548
00:42:01,427 --> 00:42:04,260
That's the beat-it-up-white dance.

549
00:42:04,463 --> 00:42:06,795
You are so stupid.

550
00:42:07,966 --> 00:42:11,402
I was over there to the right.
Did you feel me?

551
00:42:11,637 --> 00:42:15,733
-I see you ain't going nowhere.
-That's 'cause I'm sprung.

552
00:42:15,974 --> 00:42:19,876
So you're gonna clean up that mess
and make tacos, right?

553
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:23,276
I'm gonna cook and clean.
You put it down.

554
00:42:23,482 --> 00:42:27,475
I'll feed you, you big old monster.
I love you, boy.

555
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:29,151
I love you too.

556
00:42:29,488 --> 00:42:32,480
-Bring that chocolate here.
-I'm on my way.

557
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:36,319
Come here. Just make sure
you can handle me.

558
00:42:36,662 --> 00:42:39,222
You trying to go for round two?

559
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:50,130
Jody, when I say I hate you, what
I really mean is that I love you.

560
00:42:50,342 --> 00:42:54,176
But you scare me. It's like
we ain't gonna be together.

561
00:42:55,514 --> 00:42:57,505
I'm trying to sleep.

562
00:42:58,183 --> 00:43:02,643
We'll always be together.
Unless I get killed or something.

563
00:43:02,855 --> 00:43:07,849
Don't talk like that.
Don't even play around like that.

564
00:43:09,027 --> 00:43:11,689
I'd go crazy if something happened.

565
00:43:11,897 --> 00:43:16,027
On the real, you know why
I made you have Joe-Joe?

566
00:43:17,369 --> 00:43:21,328
I thought I was gonna get shot
out in these streets.

567
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:26,204
I wanted a piece of me to still
be here, even if I was gone.

568
00:43:27,546 --> 00:43:32,506
When he was born, I was like, "Cool.
No matter what happens to me...

569
00:43:32,718 --> 00:43:35,551
...I'll still be here in some way."

570
00:43:35,888 --> 00:43:39,449
So if something happened to you,
what about me?

571
00:43:41,059 --> 00:43:42,720
You'd be all right.

572
00:43:43,896 --> 00:43:45,557
Go to sleep.

573
00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:47,418
You don't want me here? Kick me out!

574
00:44:47,626 --> 00:44:50,561
Shut up, Pea! Nobody said that!

575
00:44:50,762 --> 00:44:54,095
Y'all in there-- What?
Sinuating? Insinuating?

576
00:44:54,299 --> 00:44:56,392
Fuck it. I'll leave.

577
00:44:56,602 --> 00:44:59,628
-You need to shut up.
-No, you do.

578
00:44:59,905 --> 00:45:03,102
You're the one talking
loud and making noise.

579
00:45:03,308 --> 00:45:05,139
Are you back-talking me?

580
00:45:05,344 --> 00:45:08,745
Huh? You don't know how
to act towards your man?

581
00:45:08,947 --> 00:45:12,542
I'll put my foot so far up your--
Come on in, Jody.

582
00:45:14,152 --> 00:45:18,111
A houseful of women!
Houseful of sensitive females...

583
00:45:18,323 --> 00:45:22,384
...dealing with they damn hormones!
Y'all unstable creatures!

584
00:45:22,594 --> 00:45:27,361
I won't say the "B" word. "Unstable
creatures." That's my new word.

585
00:45:27,566 --> 00:45:29,659
Mama, don't say nothing.

586
00:45:29,868 --> 00:45:32,837
You'll make it worse.
He's leaving anyway.

587
00:45:33,038 --> 00:45:37,941
I'm trying to concentrate.
They won't let me be. Want a drink?

588
00:45:38,143 --> 00:45:41,670
-No, I'm cool.
-Why are you acting all shy?

589
00:45:42,014 --> 00:45:45,347
My house is your house
Mi casa es su casa!

590
00:45:45,684 --> 00:45:48,175
I got milk, water, Kool-Aid...

591
00:45:48,387 --> 00:45:52,153
...strawberry soda. I'll get you
a strawberry soda.

592
00:45:57,029 --> 00:45:59,259
I'm sorry, Mrs. Daniels.

593
00:45:59,464 --> 00:46:01,227
I'm so sorry. I love you.

594
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:05,161
And Kim. In fact, I love you more,
'cause without you...

595
00:46:05,370 --> 00:46:06,928
...Kim wouldn't be here.

596
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:10,939
Y'all said you love me!
You told me I could stay here!

597
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:14,408
Bought me new clothes
and the video game!

598
00:46:14,613 --> 00:46:17,707
I thought we had a family!
I got no family!

599
00:46:17,916 --> 00:46:20,942
I'm trying to make that happen
with y'all.

600
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:24,081
-What, nigga?
-Come here.

601
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:26,689
I'm talking to my family here.

602
00:46:29,227 --> 00:46:31,127
I love y'all. Both of you.

603
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:34,197
Come on. I need you to roll with me.

604
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,425
All right, then. I'm leaving.

605
00:46:37,736 --> 00:46:41,536
Let's go get some liquor.
Strippers ain't at work yet.

606
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:45,301
You don't need liquor.
You're already too fired up.

607
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:48,206
Who the fuck are you calling fired up?

608
00:46:48,413 --> 00:46:51,610
You're responsible for the shit
they give me.

609
00:46:51,817 --> 00:46:56,550
You still ain't found me no job!
Hook me up with your business!

610
00:46:56,755 --> 00:46:58,882
When you gonna find me a job?

611
00:46:59,091 --> 00:47:02,549
-Why I gotta find you a job?
-'Cause you my man!

612
00:47:03,762 --> 00:47:05,923
Okay. Step to my office.

613
00:47:06,264 --> 00:47:07,925
All right.

614
00:47:08,934 --> 00:47:13,428
You have a mission. I'm gonna give
you one piece of merchandise.

615
00:47:13,772 --> 00:47:16,764
If you can sell it,
we can talk business.

616
00:47:18,443 --> 00:47:21,105
-Sell one thing.
-One thing.

617
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:23,304
Check it out.

618
00:47:23,615 --> 00:47:28,109
I got dresses, shoes, baby clothes.
Take your pick.

619
00:47:30,455 --> 00:47:32,116
I'll sell this dress.

620
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:34,882
-Not that.
-I know what I want to sell!

621
00:47:35,127 --> 00:47:39,120
Yes, the original cake.
The original man.

622
00:47:39,464 --> 00:47:41,625
Salaam. Break bread, brother.

623
00:47:46,471 --> 00:47:49,133
Hey, take a look at this dress.
Want to buy it?

624
00:47:49,474 --> 00:47:52,966
-Not my color.
-No, no, hold on. Stand still.

625
00:47:53,311 --> 00:47:55,302
Look at that. That looks good.

626
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:58,639
I don't want it.
It don't even look in season.

627
00:47:58,984 --> 00:48:01,475
It is. They're wearing this in Paris.

628
00:48:01,753 --> 00:48:05,280
I saw Tyra Banks in this
and you finer than her.

629
00:48:11,663 --> 00:48:13,324
What's the material?

630
00:48:13,665 --> 00:48:16,566
Goddamn! You want to buy
the dress or not?

631
00:48:16,768 --> 00:48:19,760
You treat me like I'm some
fucker asking for change.

632
00:48:20,005 --> 00:48:22,405
I'm doing something constructive.

633
00:48:22,607 --> 00:48:27,101
I could be out knocking folks over,
but I'm trying to live right.

634
00:48:27,345 --> 00:48:30,803
You call that living right?
Selling a stolen dress?

635
00:48:31,516 --> 00:48:35,850
I ain't stole nothing in my life!
I got this from my homeboy.

636
00:48:36,188 --> 00:48:38,679
That's what y'all do? Boost?

637
00:48:39,191 --> 00:48:44,128
Sell stolen stuff? Like that man
there trying to sell that camera?

638
00:48:56,041 --> 00:49:01,035
-You don't want me answering it?
-Go ahead. It's probably for me.

639
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:04,847
Collect call from
California Correctional Facility.

640
00:49:05,050 --> 00:49:08,577
Correctional Facility?
Do you accept the charges?

641
00:49:08,787 --> 00:49:10,379
Hell, no!

642
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:14,688
Who's calling you from jail?
That nigga Rodney?

643
00:49:14,893 --> 00:49:17,623
Oh, you don't hear me now? Hello!

644
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:22,061
Rodney's lonely. He just want
someone to talk to. Don't trip.

645
00:49:22,267 --> 00:49:25,464
That why the phone bill
was an extra $1 00?

646
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:30,471
I'm paying you to talk to him?
You putting my money on his books too?

647
00:49:30,675 --> 00:49:34,008
Didn't I tell you
to put a block on the phone?

648
00:49:34,246 --> 00:49:36,578
You don't listen to nobody.

649
00:49:36,915 --> 00:49:39,406
Don't even trip.

650
00:49:39,751 --> 00:49:43,414
Collect call from
California Correctional Facility.

651
00:49:43,622 --> 00:49:44,611
I accept.

652
00:49:44,923 --> 00:49:48,950
-Hello, Yvette?
-This ain't no motherfucking Yvette.

653
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:50,650
Put her on the phone!

654
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:54,662
This is my house!
Don't ask to speak to my woman!

655
00:49:54,866 --> 00:49:57,835
Your house, nigga?
You don't even live there.

656
00:49:58,036 --> 00:50:01,904
Is this Jody? The Jody
that got my boo pregnant?

657
00:50:02,107 --> 00:50:05,167
Who won't take his
responsibilities as a man?

658
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:08,869
Living at your mama's house?
Running around...

659
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:11,708
...like a little boy? You's a bitch!

660
00:50:11,950 --> 00:50:15,750
Look at you! What you got?
Your ass in jail!

661
00:50:15,954 --> 00:50:18,582
Don't tell me how to handle mine.

662
00:50:18,790 --> 00:50:21,554
Don't call my fucking house no more!

663
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:24,126
My girl ain't feeling you, cuz!

664
00:50:24,329 --> 00:50:27,765
Nigga, concentrate on
not dropping the soap...

665
00:50:27,966 --> 00:50:29,433
...bitch-ass nigga!

666
00:50:29,634 --> 00:50:31,465
Fuck you, cuz.

667
00:50:33,305 --> 00:50:36,103
I want a block on the fucking phone!

668
00:50:36,308 --> 00:50:37,900
All right, Jody! Damn!

669
00:50:38,109 --> 00:50:42,876
What are you doing, sitting on the
phone, telling him my business?

670
00:50:43,081 --> 00:50:44,378
He's saying:

671
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:48,519
"You still live with your mama!"
I don't want to hear that!

672
00:50:49,821 --> 00:50:53,814
She's so suspicious.
She always think I'm fucking someone.

673
00:50:54,025 --> 00:50:57,483
I go to the bathroom,
"You got a bitch in there?"

674
00:50:57,696 --> 00:51:01,689
I'm going to the store,
"There a bitch at the store?"

675
00:51:04,002 --> 00:51:08,336
Then I got to come home to Melvin
and his bullshit.

676
00:51:10,175 --> 00:51:12,006
I want to get saved.

677
00:51:13,511 --> 00:51:15,001
Say what, bruh?

678
00:51:16,681 --> 00:51:19,707
Get the fuck out of here!
We're talking.

679
00:51:20,685 --> 00:51:25,349
Poncho! I'll be done with your bike
in an hour. Come back.

680
00:51:28,026 --> 00:51:29,857
I want to be saved, Jody.

681
00:51:30,862 --> 00:51:33,990
I need to be baptized,
so I can go to heaven.

682
00:51:34,199 --> 00:51:36,997
Wash my sins away,
so them gates open up.

683
00:51:37,202 --> 00:51:40,638
I don't want Jesus to say,
"Turn your ass around."

684
00:51:41,039 --> 00:51:44,873
You should do it too.
Get baptized with me.

685
00:51:45,877 --> 00:51:50,940
What did you do, man? You did
something bad to be saying this.

686
00:51:51,149 --> 00:51:55,552
No, I'm trying to keep
from doing something. I need money.

687
00:51:55,754 --> 00:51:57,722
A job to keep me busy.

688
00:51:58,056 --> 00:52:01,355
Something besides
playing Madden all day.

689
00:52:01,559 --> 00:52:06,223
I don't even stay at Kim's house
during the day. I leave at 9:00.

690
00:52:06,431 --> 00:52:10,527
Come back at 6, acting like
I did something constructive.

691
00:52:10,735 --> 00:52:12,396
Like I'm working.

692
00:52:12,637 --> 00:52:16,004
I ain't did that shit
since continuation school.

693
00:52:16,975 --> 00:52:20,376
Sneaking around Kim and her mama
like I'm a child.

694
00:52:20,578 --> 00:52:25,641
Like I'm a scared little boy. I gotta
ask my woman and her mama for money.

695
00:52:25,884 --> 00:52:30,253
How do you think that makes me feel?
Like a man?

696
00:52:31,756 --> 00:52:36,591
This shit is tearing me up, cuz.
It's eating me alive.

697
00:52:37,762 --> 00:52:40,458
I don't want to end up killing nobody.

698
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:44,034
What am I gonna do, Jody?

699
00:52:48,773 --> 00:52:51,435
Shit, I was in the same boat too.

700
00:52:52,777 --> 00:52:57,737
You gotta find something you like
to do. Something you're interested in.

701
00:52:58,950 --> 00:53:00,611
Like I did.

702
00:53:02,287 --> 00:53:03,845
What you good at?

703
00:53:04,789 --> 00:53:06,120
Robbing.

704
00:53:10,829 --> 00:53:13,297
-Hey, Jody.
-What's going on?

705
00:53:13,498 --> 00:53:16,956
-What's up, Jody?
-What's going on with you?

706
00:53:17,168 --> 00:53:21,298
-I need some new boots.
-I got you covered with gator, girl!

707
00:53:21,506 --> 00:53:24,498
They might be bootleg,
but I got you, girl!

708
00:53:25,343 --> 00:53:30,280
Dresses! I got some business suits
coming in! You'll love those!

709
00:53:31,783 --> 00:53:34,616
Why are you yakking and talking shit?

710
00:53:34,819 --> 00:53:39,256
I'm trying to make money. When
money come in, you never complain.

711
00:53:39,457 --> 00:53:40,446
Don't be cute.

712
00:53:52,937 --> 00:53:56,065
Nice and quiet. My own little spot.

713
00:53:56,274 --> 00:53:59,710
Watch my tomatoes. Got some wine.

714
00:54:06,217 --> 00:54:09,880
Over there. I think I see
some weeds by the peppers.

715
00:54:11,289 --> 00:54:13,280
Why don't you use Weed-B-Gon?

716
00:54:13,491 --> 00:54:17,427
I'm a natural gardener.
That's how it was done way back.

717
00:54:17,629 --> 00:54:20,530
You get on your knees
and pull them up.

718
00:54:20,732 --> 00:54:24,065
It's what my mom and daddy did.
It's what I do.

719
00:54:24,269 --> 00:54:27,432
Remember to put the weeds
in the compost pile.

720
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:30,437
You doing nothing
but bossing me around.

721
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:34,305
I think I'll plant
some summer squash next year.

722
00:54:37,248 --> 00:54:39,773
-Jody, we got to stop this.
-What?

723
00:54:39,984 --> 00:54:42,976
Every time I come out,
you go in the house.

724
00:54:43,188 --> 00:54:45,713
Nobody's thinking about you, bruh.

725
00:54:46,057 --> 00:54:50,050
This is where I relax.
Take that noise somewhere else.

726
00:54:50,261 --> 00:54:54,891
Every time I come out to work
in the garden, he goes in the house.

727
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:00,797
Give me some wine.

728
00:55:11,616 --> 00:55:13,447
Seven, winner.

729
00:55:13,785 --> 00:55:15,548
Baby, be sweet.

730
00:55:15,753 --> 00:55:19,280
Eleven, winner. Seven, eleven.
That's all I'm rolling.

731
00:55:39,377 --> 00:55:42,471
How come you ain't
brought your kids around?

732
00:55:44,082 --> 00:55:47,449
Don't you got a son, 1 7,
named Duquan?

733
00:55:48,152 --> 00:55:51,087
And a little girl about 5 named Maya?

734
00:55:51,756 --> 00:55:54,816
-You tell my mama about them?
-She know.

735
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:57,524
Why ain't you brought them around?

736
00:55:58,329 --> 00:56:00,160
You ashamed of them?

737
00:56:00,832 --> 00:56:02,493
They ugly like you?

738
00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:12,503
I don't get along too well
with my babies' mamas.

739
00:56:12,844 --> 00:56:15,836
-I'm sure you understand.
-No, I don't.

740
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:18,671
I'm cool with both my babies' mamas.

741
00:56:18,883 --> 00:56:22,614
-We'll see how long that lasts.
-Long as I want it to.

742
00:56:23,187 --> 00:56:26,156
But we're talking about you, not me.

743
00:56:26,357 --> 00:56:28,951
I talked to your son the other day.

744
00:56:29,761 --> 00:56:33,663
I heard you say his name
when y'all old niggas was here...

745
00:56:33,865 --> 00:56:35,230
...playing cards.

746
00:56:35,566 --> 00:56:38,694
He live five minutes from here,
in Inglewood.

747
00:56:38,903 --> 00:56:42,964
I drove to Morningside High School
and asked him about you.

748
00:56:43,675 --> 00:56:48,703
He didn't have shit to say about you
'cause you whipped his mama's ass.

749
00:56:48,913 --> 00:56:51,211
What do you think about that?

750
00:56:51,883 --> 00:56:53,748
You gonna beat my mama?

751
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:59,112
No. I think you know better
than that, don't you?

752
00:56:59,624 --> 00:57:04,618
You want to walk around here with your
chest out, saying you a real man.

753
00:57:04,963 --> 00:57:07,864
Know why I don't like you
around my mama?

754
00:57:08,967 --> 00:57:10,628
'Cause you foul.

755
00:57:12,303 --> 00:57:15,170
You're a dirty motherfucker, Melvin.

756
00:57:16,307 --> 00:57:19,299
Don't think I'll let you
get it in her head...

757
00:57:19,577 --> 00:57:23,240
...to kick me out like
the last nigga did my brother.

758
00:57:24,649 --> 00:57:26,640
'Cause I ain't having it, bruh.

759
00:57:27,485 --> 00:57:30,511
No way, no how.

760
00:57:31,155 --> 00:57:32,816
Ah, youngster.

761
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:39,259
You get your ass out of here.

762
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:43,489
Mama!

763
00:57:43,768 --> 00:57:47,101
Yeah, that's right.
Call for your mama.

764
00:57:47,939 --> 00:57:50,703
I stayed off you
out of respect for her.

765
00:57:50,908 --> 00:57:55,641
If not for your mama, I'd have broke
your little ass down long ago.

766
00:57:55,847 --> 00:57:58,338
"Jody? Little Jody?"

767
00:57:58,616 --> 00:58:03,553
Know what I see when I look in your
eyes? A scared little bitch.

768
00:58:04,022 --> 00:58:05,580
That's what I see.

769
00:58:05,790 --> 00:58:09,726
If we was on lock-down,
I'd make you get on your knees.

770
00:58:09,927 --> 00:58:14,023
Twenty years. Let's see
where you be 20 years from now.

771
00:58:14,365 --> 00:58:15,696
Melvin?

772
00:58:21,372 --> 00:58:22,703
What y'all doing?

773
00:58:23,708 --> 00:58:25,039
Nothing.

774
00:58:25,309 --> 00:58:27,777
Can you go get me some cigarettes?

775
00:58:27,979 --> 00:58:31,881
-Maybe some beer. What you doing?
-You're so sweet.

776
00:58:33,718 --> 00:58:35,310
Watch your hands.

777
00:58:35,553 --> 00:58:37,043
Hurry back, okay?

778
00:58:42,593 --> 00:58:44,493
Want anything from the store?

779
00:58:47,331 --> 00:58:48,992
What's up, Jody?

780
00:58:49,333 --> 00:58:51,324
The candles smell good.

781
00:58:53,171 --> 00:58:54,502
Aromatherapy.

782
00:58:55,540 --> 00:58:56,564
You smoke?

783
00:58:56,841 --> 00:58:59,173
No. I don't mess with that.

784
00:58:59,510 --> 00:59:03,947
So you and Yvette got a baby?
Where y'all stay at?

785
00:59:04,515 --> 00:59:06,312
We don't live together.

786
00:59:06,851 --> 00:59:10,150
You ain't gotta lie.
I know y'all live together.

787
00:59:10,354 --> 00:59:13,016
You drop her off
and pick her up every day.

788
00:59:13,291 --> 00:59:17,250
That's just what we do.
I don't want to discuss 'Vette.

789
00:59:17,462 --> 00:59:20,898
We don't need to talk.
I just want some dick.

790
00:59:26,537 --> 00:59:30,701
Why you want to fuck me?
To make my girl mad?

791
00:59:31,375 --> 00:59:33,707
-That what you want to do?
-No!

792
00:59:34,879 --> 00:59:36,540
It ain't like that.

793
00:59:36,881 --> 00:59:41,375
I just think you're cute.
I mean, I see you all the time.

794
00:59:42,386 --> 00:59:44,877
When we was in the parking lot...

795
00:59:45,890 --> 00:59:48,552
...I thought we was feeling
each other.

796
00:59:49,227 --> 00:59:50,888
Was I wrong?

797
00:59:54,565 --> 00:59:56,556
Yeah, I was feeling you.

798
00:59:57,401 --> 01:00:00,063
But I ain't feeling this. I'm out.

799
01:00:01,572 --> 01:00:04,405
Jody, come on. Don't be like that.

800
01:00:06,410 --> 01:00:08,571
This is just between us.

801
01:00:09,213 --> 01:00:12,410
I see how you look
when you come around.

802
01:00:12,617 --> 01:00:15,415
You saying you don't want to hit this?

803
01:00:15,786 --> 01:00:18,846
Come over here and get this pussy.

804
01:00:19,223 --> 01:00:22,317
I don't need to go there with you.

805
01:00:23,961 --> 01:00:25,292
Yvette.

806
01:00:25,997 --> 01:00:28,761
Besides, I ain't got no condoms.

807
01:00:28,966 --> 01:00:30,490
No way.

808
01:00:36,841 --> 01:00:39,435
Somebody don't want to leave.

809
01:00:50,288 --> 01:00:52,153
Oh, fuck!

810
01:00:52,390 --> 01:00:54,620
What are you doing, girl?

811
01:00:57,895 --> 01:00:59,658
I can't do this.

812
01:01:08,172 --> 01:01:09,503
Oh, shit.

813
01:01:21,552 --> 01:01:23,713
I know you want this.

814
01:01:24,388 --> 01:01:25,719
I can't do this.

815
01:01:27,225 --> 01:01:29,216
I promise it'll be good.

816
01:01:29,493 --> 01:01:33,554
No, this shit is foul.
It's foul. This shit's wrong!

817
01:01:34,398 --> 01:01:38,198
Get off me. I can't fuck you.
My girl finds out...

818
01:01:38,402 --> 01:01:40,962
...she'll kill me.
I love her too much.

819
01:01:41,172 --> 01:01:45,040
So you a little bitch?
Your girl tells you what to do?

820
01:01:45,243 --> 01:01:47,234
I told you it was a trick.

821
01:01:48,246 --> 01:01:49,577
Hood rat.

822
01:01:51,916 --> 01:01:56,546
I don't need you! I can get
dick any time I want! You want this!

823
01:01:56,754 --> 01:02:00,053
No, you want this.
You lucky I let you taste it.

824
01:02:00,258 --> 01:02:02,749
This Daddy Dick belongs to Yvette.

825
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:05,520
Not from what I hear, you ho!

826
01:02:06,030 --> 01:02:07,019
Fuck you!

827
01:02:07,265 --> 01:02:10,166
You don't know how
to suck dick anyway.

828
01:02:33,090 --> 01:02:34,887
Why is that bitch staring?

829
01:02:35,092 --> 01:02:38,027
I don't know,
but she about to get slapped.

830
01:02:40,064 --> 01:02:41,053
Fuck you.

831
01:02:41,465 --> 01:02:43,126
No.

832
01:02:58,416 --> 01:03:01,408
How come you ain't waving
at her today?

833
01:03:01,652 --> 01:03:03,779
I ain't thinking about her.

834
01:03:03,988 --> 01:03:08,982
She was staring at me today.
She was about to catch a beat-down.

835
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:12,151
I think she's a lesbian for real.

836
01:03:13,151 --> 01:03:23,151
