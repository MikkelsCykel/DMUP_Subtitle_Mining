1
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,566
I have
a priority package

2
00:05:07,601 --> 00:05:10,068
from the nat-sat
printing room.

3
00:05:10,103 --> 00:05:12,104
Why don't you
say it a little louder?

4
00:05:12,139 --> 00:05:13,070
We could open
the window.

5
00:05:13,105 --> 00:05:15,108
You could shout it
towards Moscow.

6
00:05:15,143 --> 00:05:16,074
Sorry. I-

7
00:05:16,109 --> 00:05:19,077
it's not your fault
you're stupid.

8
00:05:19,112 --> 00:05:22,615
Just open the case
and get out of here.

9
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:25,134
The case is chained
to my wrist.

10
00:05:25,169 --> 00:05:27,894
Security dispatch
has the key.

11
00:05:27,929 --> 00:05:30,620
Leave the material,
take the case,

12
00:05:30,655 --> 00:05:32,622
and wait outside.

13
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:34,591
No can do.

14
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:37,128
The material's
locked inside.

15
00:05:37,163 --> 00:05:39,630
All right.
Just give it to me.

16
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:49,137
Get in the closet.

17
00:06:08,152 --> 00:06:09,621
Hi-weather IV

18
00:06:09,656 --> 00:06:11,657
transmitted this stuff
an hour ago.

19
00:06:11,692 --> 00:06:13,624
Beautiful close-ups!

20
00:06:13,659 --> 00:06:16,627
Miegs and sline
will drool.

21
00:06:16,662 --> 00:06:19,664
They're late again.
Unusual for soldiers.

22
00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:22,666
They know
what they're doing.

23
00:06:26,669 --> 00:06:28,671
Gentlemen.

24
00:06:28,706 --> 00:06:30,639
Here they are.

25
00:06:30,674 --> 00:06:33,176
Are those the shots
from the latest fly-by?

26
00:06:33,211 --> 00:06:34,677
Over here, general.

27
00:06:38,179 --> 00:06:39,647
Wait.

28
00:06:39,682 --> 00:06:42,183
Is someone
in this closet?

29
00:06:42,218 --> 00:06:43,184
Ignore him.

30
00:06:43,684 --> 00:06:45,185
He's just one
of our couriers.

31
00:06:45,686 --> 00:06:47,938
Well... ok.

32
00:06:47,973 --> 00:06:50,155
Nice close-ups.

33
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:53,193
Definitely approaching
full-go hour.

34
00:06:55,695 --> 00:06:59,698
I greased the house committee
for covert appropriations.

35
00:06:59,733 --> 00:07:03,700
They think the funds are
for more stealth bombers.

36
00:07:03,735 --> 00:07:05,720
We've selected
2 GLG-20s-

37
00:07:05,755 --> 00:07:07,671
they're the best men
we have.

38
00:07:07,706 --> 00:07:10,208
The last 2
were the best men we had.

39
00:07:10,243 --> 00:07:12,675
Now they're our
2 best dead men.

40
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:15,211
I'm convinced
there's a security leak

41
00:07:15,246 --> 00:07:16,678
in your training program.

42
00:07:16,713 --> 00:07:19,179
Well, we could
bypass training.

43
00:07:19,214 --> 00:07:22,718
No. They'll train with
2 other GLG-20s-

44
00:07:22,753 --> 00:07:26,222
2 who are responsible
for the project

45
00:07:26,257 --> 00:07:28,223
and 2 who are...

46
00:07:28,258 --> 00:07:29,690
disposable.

47
00:07:29,725 --> 00:07:31,726
Are you suggesting
we assign this job

48
00:07:31,761 --> 00:07:32,728
to inferior personnel?

49
00:07:33,228 --> 00:07:34,729
No, I understand.

50
00:07:35,229 --> 00:07:36,230
2 teams.

51
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,231
One to do the job,

52
00:07:38,732 --> 00:07:41,234
the other
to be a diversion.

53
00:07:41,269 --> 00:07:43,737
You mean decoys? Targets?

54
00:07:43,772 --> 00:07:44,703
Exactly.

55
00:07:44,738 --> 00:07:47,240
GLG-20s don't
exactly grow on trees.

56
00:07:47,275 --> 00:07:49,509
I'd hate to waste
2 of them as targets.

57
00:07:49,544 --> 00:07:51,743
I'm sure you can find
a couple of men

58
00:07:51,778 --> 00:07:53,744
you won't mind wasting.

59
00:08:01,461 --> 00:08:03,462
I'll be when?
Lovin' you

60
00:08:03,497 --> 00:08:05,965
cloudy days or sunny

61
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,233
lovin' you

62
00:08:07,268 --> 00:08:08,431
are you sure?

63
00:08:08,466 --> 00:08:09,932
That's a promise, honey?

64
00:08:09,967 --> 00:08:13,970
When your kiss can
no longer pack a thrill

65
00:08:15,471 --> 00:08:16,472
nothin'.

66
00:08:16,972 --> 00:08:19,977
I'll still
be lovin' you

67
00:08:20,012 --> 00:08:21,979
I'll be huggin' you?

68
00:08:22,014 --> 00:08:23,444
How?

69
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:25,982
Like a baby panda,
kissin' you

70
00:08:26,017 --> 00:08:26,948
where?

71
00:08:26,983 --> 00:08:28,950
On your
old veranda

72
00:08:28,985 --> 00:08:32,237
when your charm, dear,
is absolutely nil

73
00:08:32,272 --> 00:08:35,489
yeah, I know. You'll
still be lovin' me.

74
00:08:37,492 --> 00:08:38,959
Billin', cooin'

75
00:08:38,994 --> 00:08:40,995
you I'll keep
pursuin'

76
00:08:41,495 --> 00:08:43,461
always lovin'

77
00:08:43,496 --> 00:08:45,498
hotter than
a baker's oven

78
00:08:46,999 --> 00:08:50,001
we do smart work

79
00:08:50,501 --> 00:08:51,467
what?

80
00:08:51,502 --> 00:08:53,504
You'll just love
our artwork

81
00:08:55,008 --> 00:08:57,009
don't blame me...

82
00:08:57,044 --> 00:08:57,975
what?

83
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:01,012
Aren't you taking
this test tomorrow?

84
00:09:01,047 --> 00:09:03,513
The foreign
service board? Yeah.

85
00:09:03,548 --> 00:09:05,015
Don't you
have to study?

86
00:09:05,515 --> 00:09:08,517
I know the FSB exam
glass-backwards.

87
00:09:09,018 --> 00:09:11,484
I've taken it
3 times already.

88
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,524
It's supposed to be
different this year-

89
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:17,044
500 questions
in 2 hours.

90
00:09:17,079 --> 00:09:19,529
Let me see
the booklet.

91
00:09:22,031 --> 00:09:23,997
Look at these samples.

92
00:09:24,032 --> 00:09:26,034
All multiple choice.
It's easy.

93
00:09:28,535 --> 00:09:29,500
Here.

94
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:32,040
"If discovered appropriating
classified documents

95
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,041
"at a foreign
consulate reception,

96
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:37,543
"you should...
a- express concern,

97
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:39,544
"b-act surprised,

98
00:09:40,045 --> 00:09:41,546
"c-deny everything,

99
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,013
and d-all 3."

100
00:09:44,048 --> 00:09:45,549
The answer is "d," all 3.

101
00:09:45,584 --> 00:09:47,516
Common-sense stuff.

102
00:09:47,551 --> 00:09:50,055
I guess you just don't want
advancement bad enough.

103
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,557
My granddad
was an envoy.

104
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,523
My dad was an envoy.

105
00:09:54,558 --> 00:09:56,559
I was born
into the trade.

106
00:09:58,061 --> 00:10:00,562
Besides, I've arranged
for an intimate lunch

107
00:10:00,597 --> 00:10:03,029
with our supervisor.

108
00:10:03,064 --> 00:10:04,565
You have to take
that test.

109
00:10:05,066 --> 00:10:08,071
I'm very hurt that's why
you invited me over.

110
00:10:08,106 --> 00:10:10,037
Don't do that, Alice.

111
00:10:10,072 --> 00:10:13,074
I'm sorry.
I'm not myself today.

112
00:10:13,109 --> 00:10:16,077
I saw my neurologist
this morning.

113
00:10:16,577 --> 00:10:19,080
Don't give me some
bullshit you're dying.

114
00:10:19,579 --> 00:10:21,081
No...

115
00:10:21,581 --> 00:10:23,582
not now.

116
00:11:03,076 --> 00:11:05,579
Radio: 'cause there's
one thing we forgot to say

117
00:11:07,581 --> 00:11:09,082
we're gonna
rock the house down

118
00:11:09,117 --> 00:11:10,548
Millbarge.

119
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:13,049
We're gonna
shake up the place-

120
00:11:13,084 --> 00:11:15,836
where's the brain
for the scramjam 7000?

121
00:11:15,871 --> 00:11:18,589
Procurement picked it up
over an hour ago.

122
00:11:18,624 --> 00:11:20,056
Was it fixed?

123
00:11:20,091 --> 00:11:21,558
Yeah, with new
voice-scramblers.

124
00:11:21,593 --> 00:11:26,095
Oh. What about that
red-Chinese radio chatter?

125
00:11:26,596 --> 00:11:29,097
It's done.
Here you go.

126
00:11:29,132 --> 00:11:31,099
Done?

127
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,067
That was a static-filled,

128
00:11:34,102 --> 00:11:36,068
triple-scrambled
microwave transmission

129
00:11:36,103 --> 00:11:38,608
between 2 soldiers
talking in mandarin Chinese.

130
00:11:38,643 --> 00:11:40,073
They were only using

131
00:11:40,108 --> 00:11:42,110
a simple polyphonetically
grouped 20-digit key

132
00:11:42,145 --> 00:11:44,111
transposed
in boustrophendonic form

133
00:11:44,146 --> 00:11:46,380
with multiple nulls.

134
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:48,580
I broke it with this.

135
00:11:48,615 --> 00:11:50,115
A drogan's
decoder wheel?

136
00:11:50,616 --> 00:11:53,869
They put these into
cereal boxes for kids.

137
00:11:53,904 --> 00:11:56,764
Yeah, I found it in
a box of lucky charms.

138
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,625
Break it down again
with the machines!

139
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,628
I already did.

140
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:08,132
Well, then...
clean up the desk!

141
00:12:13,636 --> 00:12:14,602
Good.

142
00:12:14,637 --> 00:12:16,104
That's much better.

143
00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:19,642
By the way, good luck
on the test tomorrow.

144
00:12:19,677 --> 00:12:21,108
What test?

145
00:12:21,143 --> 00:12:24,145
The foreign service
board exams. Good luck.

146
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,146
Foreign service
boards tomorrow?

147
00:12:26,181 --> 00:12:27,614
I can't take it.

148
00:12:27,649 --> 00:12:29,650
I haven't studied.
I'm not prepared.

149
00:12:29,685 --> 00:12:32,617
You were bumped up
on the list.

150
00:12:32,652 --> 00:12:34,656
You're scheduled
for tomorrow morning.

151
00:12:34,691 --> 00:12:37,122
I'm sure I told you.

152
00:12:37,157 --> 00:12:40,660
This is dated
2 weeks ago.

153
00:12:40,695 --> 00:12:42,125
You planned this.

154
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,162
You want me
to fail that test

155
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:47,164
so you can keep me in
the center of the earth

156
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:48,666
doing your work for you.

157
00:12:49,165 --> 00:12:50,632
You just watch
your mouth, mister.

158
00:12:50,667 --> 00:12:53,673
This department's laying off
civilians left and right.

159
00:12:57,175 --> 00:12:58,176
Where are you going?

160
00:12:59,176 --> 00:13:01,143
Home. To study.

161
00:13:01,178 --> 00:13:05,681
One night studying
for a grade-19 FSB exam?

162
00:13:06,181 --> 00:13:07,147
Good luck.

163
00:13:07,182 --> 00:13:10,186
Listen, captain, I'm
going to pass that exam,

164
00:13:10,221 --> 00:13:12,688
and I'm going to get
out of this hole

165
00:13:13,188 --> 00:13:16,190
and do some really important
work for national security.

166
00:13:16,691 --> 00:13:18,157
Yeah, sure.

167
00:13:18,192 --> 00:13:21,194
I was going to do
your family a favor

168
00:13:21,229 --> 00:13:24,197
and hook up
the Disney channel for free.

169
00:13:24,232 --> 00:13:25,698
Well, forget it.

170
00:13:28,202 --> 00:13:30,453
Ladies and gentlemen,
as of this afternoon,

171
00:13:30,488 --> 00:13:33,097
the undersecretary
for south American affairs

172
00:13:33,132 --> 00:13:35,670
emphatically denies
any and all intervention

173
00:13:35,705 --> 00:13:38,174
in the current realignment
of top positions

174
00:13:38,209 --> 00:13:41,211
in the Paraguayan air force.
Thank you very much.

175
00:13:41,246 --> 00:13:43,212
What about
the army's request

176
00:13:43,713 --> 00:13:45,178
for spraying
subsidies?

177
00:13:45,213 --> 00:13:47,720
Are there
any Paraguayans here?

178
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,185
No?

179
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:52,723
Their request for subsidies
was not Paraguayan,

180
00:13:52,758 --> 00:13:54,690
as it were.

181
00:13:54,725 --> 00:13:58,227
The United States would never-
if the president-

182
00:13:58,262 --> 00:14:01,729
that's how it will always be.
Is that clear?

183
00:14:01,764 --> 00:14:03,195
How can you say

184
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:05,983
we aren't spending
millions on spraying

185
00:14:06,018 --> 00:14:08,736
when the international
wheat board reported

186
00:14:08,771 --> 00:14:10,202
"extensive contamination

187
00:14:10,237 --> 00:14:12,739
in the grain fields
of southern Argentina"?

188
00:14:12,774 --> 00:14:15,241
The state de... eber...
uh... the state...

189
00:14:15,276 --> 00:14:16,708
microphones...

190
00:14:16,743 --> 00:14:18,994
cutting out on us.
I'm sorry.

191
00:14:19,029 --> 00:14:21,389
However,
the qu... wo... si...

192
00:14:21,424 --> 00:14:23,750
...unch date,
so I must go.

193
00:14:27,127 --> 00:14:32,095
These examinations
are qualifiers for positions

194
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:35,633
in the intelligence sections
of our embassies overseas.

195
00:14:37,134 --> 00:14:41,641
The nature of your postings
will be secret.

196
00:14:41,676 --> 00:14:45,609
Now, secret work
can be very risky.

197
00:14:45,644 --> 00:14:49,146
I cite what happened to one
of our greatest Americans-

198
00:14:49,181 --> 00:14:50,648
not yet!

199
00:14:52,148 --> 00:14:53,650
Oop!
Excuse me.

200
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:54,668
I'm sorry.

201
00:14:54,703 --> 00:14:55,651
My fault.

202
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:06,125
I'm sorry I'm late.

203
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,162
I had to attend
the reading of a will.

204
00:15:09,664 --> 00:15:11,165
I had to stay
till the very end.

205
00:15:11,665 --> 00:15:14,167
I found out
I received nothing.

206
00:15:14,202 --> 00:15:16,168
Broke my arm.

207
00:15:20,674 --> 00:15:25,677
Would you hold my wallet
while I take the test?

208
00:15:25,712 --> 00:15:27,679
There's $1,000 in there...

209
00:15:27,714 --> 00:15:29,697
or maybe there isn't.

210
00:15:29,732 --> 00:15:31,646
Know what I mean?

211
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:33,684
Are you saying
I can take this money

212
00:15:33,719 --> 00:15:35,704
if I help you pass?

213
00:15:35,739 --> 00:15:37,690
What do you think?

214
00:15:42,192 --> 00:15:43,694
Thank you.

215
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:46,696
So, where do I-

216
00:15:46,731 --> 00:15:48,196
sit down!

217
00:16:06,212 --> 00:16:08,213
You may begin...

218
00:16:08,248 --> 00:16:09,214
now.

219
00:16:32,236 --> 00:16:34,238
Excuse me.

220
00:17:50,303 --> 00:17:52,304
Ahem.

221
00:17:57,308 --> 00:17:59,309
Ahem! Ahem!

222
00:18:10,819 --> 00:18:13,321
Ahem! Ahem! Ahem!

223
00:18:13,823 --> 00:18:14,823
Ahem!

224
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,306
Thank you.

225
00:18:36,341 --> 00:18:37,842
You're welcome.

226
00:18:40,847 --> 00:18:42,849
Oh, god, the pressure!

227
00:18:42,884 --> 00:18:44,850
I can't take it!

228
00:18:47,852 --> 00:18:49,819
I can't take it!

229
00:18:49,854 --> 00:18:52,355
I can't!
I can't do it!

230
00:18:59,362 --> 00:19:01,864
I can't... what page?

231
00:19:04,032 --> 00:19:05,498
This is
Emmett Fitz-Hume.

232
00:19:05,533 --> 00:19:08,535
He's an information
officer at state.

233
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:11,538
He started there in '74
as a mail boy.

234
00:19:11,573 --> 00:19:14,059
His father
got him his job.

235
00:19:14,094 --> 00:19:16,070
This is Austin Millbarge.

236
00:19:16,105 --> 00:19:18,011
He's a repair supervisor

237
00:19:18,046 --> 00:19:21,513
in dia's code-breaking arm
at the pentagon.

238
00:19:21,548 --> 00:19:25,551
Wiggled into supervisor's pay
through an f-section.

239
00:19:25,586 --> 00:19:28,053
His last job
before joining defense

240
00:19:28,088 --> 00:19:29,519
was fixing office copiers.

241
00:19:29,554 --> 00:19:33,559
He's good with hardware,
got some Russian.

242
00:19:33,594 --> 00:19:35,061
Want to see
their test scores?

243
00:19:35,561 --> 00:19:37,027
What the hell for?

244
00:19:37,062 --> 00:19:40,564
They're a couple of absolutely
self-involved bullshit artists

245
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:43,067
who got caught cheating
on a departmental exam.

246
00:19:43,102 --> 00:19:46,569
They'll do anything
to save their jobs.

247
00:19:46,604 --> 00:19:49,071
One's got
basic diplomacy skills.

248
00:19:49,571 --> 00:19:52,075
The other's a code-breaker
with language ability.

249
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:55,077
I believe
we've found our decoys.

250
00:19:55,112 --> 00:19:56,578
Ahhh!

251
00:19:58,579 --> 00:20:01,082
Heart attack!
Ahhh!

252
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:06,551
Can I borrow your pen?

253
00:20:06,586 --> 00:20:08,839
Everybody,
please, stand back!

254
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:11,057
I am a trained
cardiovascular

255
00:20:11,092 --> 00:20:13,059
respiratory emergency
assist technician.

256
00:20:13,094 --> 00:20:16,096
I want all of you to stand back!
This man needs air!

257
00:20:16,596 --> 00:20:18,097
In fact, all of you
should leave the room-

258
00:20:18,132 --> 00:20:20,099
well?

259
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:25,602
So, what are we gonna get?
Dismissal? Suspension?

260
00:20:25,637 --> 00:20:28,607
Censure? Departmental
prosecution? What?

261
00:20:28,642 --> 00:20:30,109
Promotion.

262
00:20:30,144 --> 00:20:31,074
What?

263
00:20:31,109 --> 00:20:32,610
That's right.

264
00:20:33,111 --> 00:20:35,112
We like what we've
seen of you two.

265
00:20:35,612 --> 00:20:37,613
We're bucking you
right up front

266
00:20:38,114 --> 00:20:40,115
to gathering,
level 20.

267
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:42,082
Gathering,
level 20?

268
00:20:42,117 --> 00:20:44,118
That's quite a step up
in base pay.

269
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:46,122
We're not
in trouble?

270
00:20:46,622 --> 00:20:48,623
We're not recruiting
for the boy scouts.

271
00:20:49,124 --> 00:20:51,125
We want people
who are aggressive,

272
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:54,128
who know how
to go after that edge

273
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,630
you need to survive.

274
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,632
We especially liked
the way you two guys

275
00:21:00,132 --> 00:21:01,633
were working as a team
in there.

276
00:21:01,668 --> 00:21:03,599
Now...

277
00:21:03,634 --> 00:21:07,140
if you feel
you can work together,

278
00:21:07,175 --> 00:21:09,142
you're on your way up.

279
00:21:11,143 --> 00:21:14,145
We've got a very
special assignment.

280
00:21:15,646 --> 00:21:17,147
Foreign service?

281
00:21:17,182 --> 00:21:18,113
Yes.

282
00:21:18,148 --> 00:21:19,649
Undercover work?

283
00:21:19,684 --> 00:21:21,151
Yes.

284
00:21:22,654 --> 00:21:24,155
Emmett Fitz-Hume.

285
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,621
Austin Millbarge.

286
00:21:25,656 --> 00:21:27,657
When do we begin
our training?

287
00:21:28,158 --> 00:21:29,159
Right away.

288
00:21:29,194 --> 00:21:30,659
Boy!

289
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:41,335
We're just
hitching a ride.

290
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:43,052
They won't
make us jump.

291
00:21:43,087 --> 00:21:46,589
Jump? No chance.
We won't have to jump.

292
00:21:48,091 --> 00:21:50,092
All right,
sky-troopers!

293
00:21:50,127 --> 00:21:51,559
Let's go!

294
00:21:51,594 --> 00:21:54,095
Go?
What does he mean?

295
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:55,864
You can't do this!

296
00:21:55,899 --> 00:21:57,598
What are you doing?

297
00:21:58,098 --> 00:22:00,067
Aaah!

298
00:22:00,102 --> 00:22:02,104
Fitz-Hume!

299
00:22:02,139 --> 00:22:04,606
Aaah!

300
00:22:22,622 --> 00:22:25,123
Help! Help! Help! Help!

301
00:22:25,158 --> 00:22:27,625
Oh! Oh, no! Oh, no!

302
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:29,143
Whoa!

303
00:22:29,178 --> 00:22:30,627
Aaah!

304
00:22:33,128 --> 00:22:36,133
Woooaaahhh!

305
00:22:36,168 --> 00:22:37,634
Oooh!

306
00:22:48,643 --> 00:22:50,609
Where are we?

307
00:22:50,644 --> 00:22:52,647
I don't know.
I wasn't watching.

308
00:22:52,682 --> 00:22:54,650
I lost everything
at 7,000 feet.

309
00:22:56,152 --> 00:22:57,617
You hear that?

310
00:22:57,652 --> 00:22:59,154
Yeah.
It's a dickfer.

311
00:22:59,189 --> 00:23:00,654
What's a dickfer?

312
00:23:00,689 --> 00:23:02,656
To pee with.

313
00:23:05,158 --> 00:23:07,409
Man: Aah!

314
00:23:07,444 --> 00:23:09,661
Was that me?

315
00:23:12,666 --> 00:23:14,167
Eiiaaww! Haiii!

316
00:23:26,675 --> 00:23:28,177
We need a plan.

317
00:23:28,677 --> 00:23:30,429
Let's play dead.

318
00:23:30,464 --> 00:23:32,182
Eiiaaww!
Haiii!

319
00:23:34,183 --> 00:23:35,185
Haiii!
Haiii!

320
00:23:35,685 --> 00:23:37,186
Come on, superspy,
think of something.

321
00:23:37,686 --> 00:23:40,688
You're the diplomat.
Talk to them.

322
00:23:45,192 --> 00:23:46,657
All right.

323
00:23:46,692 --> 00:23:48,159
Stop right there,

324
00:23:48,194 --> 00:23:51,199
and I'll bring
back the sun.

325
00:23:51,234 --> 00:23:52,664
Ok?

326
00:23:52,699 --> 00:23:54,951
This is my sister.

327
00:23:54,986 --> 00:23:57,095
You can
all have her.

328
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:59,170
I hear
she's very good.

329
00:23:59,205 --> 00:24:01,707
One more step,
I start swinging!

330
00:24:01,742 --> 00:24:04,209
He's threatening you!
Let's get him!

331
00:24:04,244 --> 00:24:05,675
Show some balls!

332
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:08,714
It's too late to try
to impress them.

333
00:24:10,215 --> 00:24:11,716
That's enough.

334
00:24:18,721 --> 00:24:19,721
Austin Millbarge?

335
00:24:20,222 --> 00:24:21,723
Here, sir.

336
00:24:22,224 --> 00:24:23,724
Emmett Fitz-Hume.

337
00:24:24,225 --> 00:24:25,728
Hello.

338
00:24:29,231 --> 00:24:30,232
Sir.

339
00:24:32,234 --> 00:24:34,735
Colonel Rhombus,
special projects training.

340
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:36,701
We've been expecting you.

341
00:24:36,736 --> 00:24:40,239
Excuse me, but what
was all this, uh...

342
00:24:40,274 --> 00:24:42,206
that's how
I welcome new trainees.

343
00:24:42,241 --> 00:24:44,245
What's wrong with
coffee and a handshake?

344
00:24:44,745 --> 00:24:47,997
It's my job to get you ready
for field combat.

345
00:24:48,032 --> 00:24:51,250
I must know right away
what I've got to work with.

346
00:24:51,285 --> 00:24:53,251
I've made my decision.

347
00:24:53,286 --> 00:24:55,254
What's it say?

348
00:24:55,289 --> 00:24:56,219
"Pussy."

349
00:24:56,254 --> 00:24:58,256
That's not fair.
They had swords.

350
00:24:58,291 --> 00:24:59,756
What could we do?

351
00:25:00,257 --> 00:25:03,761
It depends on your
particular arena of combat.

352
00:25:03,796 --> 00:25:04,762
Maybe this.

353
00:25:21,777 --> 00:25:24,737
I'll take you
back to the base.

354
00:25:27,531 --> 00:25:29,282
This is
the obstacle course.

355
00:25:29,317 --> 00:25:30,998
It is essentially the course

356
00:25:31,033 --> 00:25:32,999
familiar to
armed service recruits,

357
00:25:33,034 --> 00:25:36,036
except here in intelligence
operative training,

358
00:25:36,071 --> 00:25:38,006
we do it a bit differently.

359
00:25:38,041 --> 00:25:40,543
We add the element
of scorched earth.

360
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:53,553
This is your standard
bog negotiation trial.

361
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:59,559
You'll be judged
on survivability and time.

362
00:25:59,594 --> 00:26:01,077
Enter...

363
00:26:01,112 --> 00:26:02,561
now!

364
00:26:10,567 --> 00:26:12,067
Heads down!

365
00:26:15,573 --> 00:26:18,075
This will
verify your ability

366
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:20,577
to stay afloat
at high speeds.

367
00:26:32,585 --> 00:26:35,090
We'll now
begin with afpsr-

368
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:38,593
air force
passive strain response.

369
00:26:40,093 --> 00:26:43,096
You'll not be required
to exert yourself at all,

370
00:26:43,597 --> 00:26:47,600
only to survive aggravated
body temperature measurement.

371
00:26:50,101 --> 00:26:51,104
Whoa!

372
00:26:52,104 --> 00:26:53,606
Oooh!
Owww!

373
00:26:53,641 --> 00:26:55,073
Hot! Hot! Hot!

374
00:26:55,108 --> 00:26:58,110
We will now determine
your g-force threshold.

375
00:26:58,145 --> 00:27:00,378
Just relax, gentlemen.

376
00:27:00,413 --> 00:27:02,612
I guess
we just sit here?

377
00:27:02,647 --> 00:27:05,115
Piece of cake.

378
00:27:38,644 --> 00:27:40,896
You want some coffee?

379
00:27:40,931 --> 00:27:43,148
That's a good idea.

380
00:27:47,153 --> 00:27:49,619
Colonel,
we were just talking,

381
00:27:49,654 --> 00:27:51,906
and, uh, we've had
loads of fun here.

382
00:27:51,941 --> 00:27:54,158
Met new friends,
had a great lunch.

383
00:27:54,193 --> 00:27:56,124
Wasn't that
a great lunch?

384
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:58,625
The tuna and cream
casserole was beautiful.

385
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:02,164
Anyway, we were talking,
and we'd like to go home now.

386
00:28:02,199 --> 00:28:04,184
Thanks for the bruises.

387
00:28:04,219 --> 00:28:06,169
Keep the stool samples.

388
00:28:11,672 --> 00:28:15,675
Boys, it would be a shame
to have to kill you now.

389
00:28:17,177 --> 00:28:19,178
What did he
mean by that?

390
00:28:19,213 --> 00:28:21,180
It means we're O. I. O.

391
00:28:21,215 --> 00:28:22,648
What's that?

392
00:28:22,683 --> 00:28:25,685
Obligated
Involuntary Officers.

393
00:28:26,686 --> 00:28:28,152
Gentlemen,

394
00:28:28,187 --> 00:28:30,190
begin radical vertical
impact simulation...

395
00:28:30,225 --> 00:28:32,191
now.

396
00:28:45,327 --> 00:28:46,828
Come in.

397
00:28:51,332 --> 00:28:53,833
You wanted
to see us, sir?

398
00:28:58,337 --> 00:28:59,840
Sit.

399
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:09,847
Congratulations, men.
You're about to enter

400
00:29:09,882 --> 00:29:11,848
the operational phase
of your assignment.

401
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:15,851
I'm not authorized to give you
the full operational packet,

402
00:29:15,886 --> 00:29:18,856
but I'll tell you the location
of your initial drop

403
00:29:19,357 --> 00:29:21,358
will be well inside
the borders of Pakistan.

404
00:29:21,393 --> 00:29:23,361
Pakistan?
Pakistan?

405
00:30:34,921 --> 00:30:36,923
Is one of these people
our contact?

406
00:30:39,925 --> 00:30:42,428
Ok...

407
00:30:42,928 --> 00:30:45,930
who led the American league
in home runs in 1953?

408
00:30:49,435 --> 00:30:51,436
I'll handle this.

409
00:31:22,962 --> 00:31:23,963
What's he doing?

410
00:31:24,463 --> 00:31:25,966
It's just their way
of saying hello.

411
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:29,427
Hello.
I'm Austin.

412
00:31:33,931 --> 00:31:36,433
Hi. Bud Schnelker,
liaison office.

413
00:31:36,934 --> 00:31:38,434
U. S. Consulate,
karachi.

414
00:31:38,935 --> 00:31:40,436
Rob Hodges.
DIA, west Asian section.

415
00:31:40,471 --> 00:31:41,937
Welcome to Pakistan.

416
00:31:42,437 --> 00:31:44,440
Boy, we're glad
to see you guys.

417
00:31:45,942 --> 00:31:46,908
When's lunch?

418
00:31:46,943 --> 00:31:49,694
Come on, guys.
Jeep's over here.

419
00:31:55,657 --> 00:31:59,159
Emmett: I'm starving.
What time you got?

420
00:32:05,167 --> 00:32:07,169
Listen, could we stop?

421
00:32:07,669 --> 00:32:09,170
What's the matter?

422
00:32:09,205 --> 00:32:10,671
I got to take a leak.

423
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:23,147
You should go, too.

424
00:32:23,182 --> 00:32:25,649
What are you,
my mother?

425
00:32:25,684 --> 00:32:27,685
Don't you think I'm
capable of determining

426
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,704
my own time to go
to the bathroom?

427
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:31,689
So, isn't now
one of those times?

428
00:32:31,724 --> 00:32:33,155
No.

429
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:35,692
You don't feel a certain
degree of urgent pressure

430
00:32:35,727 --> 00:32:37,192
on the inner wall
of your bladder

431
00:32:37,227 --> 00:32:39,196
now right at
this moment?

432
00:32:39,231 --> 00:32:41,162
No. I'm fine.

433
00:32:41,197 --> 00:32:44,199
Well, wouldn't you feel
more comfortable

434
00:32:44,234 --> 00:32:47,201
being fully relieved
of excess fluids now?

435
00:32:48,703 --> 00:32:51,705
I got to take a whiz?

436
00:32:52,706 --> 00:32:54,459
Don't go away.

437
00:32:54,494 --> 00:32:56,212
Oh, we'll be here.

438
00:33:02,216 --> 00:33:05,719
These guys are not
our legitimate contacts.

439
00:33:05,754 --> 00:33:07,720
They're KGB special branch.

440
00:33:07,755 --> 00:33:09,186
Oh, come on.

441
00:33:09,221 --> 00:33:11,187
That was
a Russian wristwatch.

442
00:33:11,222 --> 00:33:13,224
I know the country of origin of
every timepiece in the world.

443
00:33:13,259 --> 00:33:16,187
That was a Russian copy
of a 1969 Timex digital.

444
00:33:16,222 --> 00:33:18,153
Is this your hobby?

445
00:33:18,188 --> 00:33:21,190
Basic. Most common
slip-up in espionage.

446
00:33:21,225 --> 00:33:24,693
We walked right
into enemy hands.

447
00:33:26,195 --> 00:33:27,195
Hi.

448
00:33:27,695 --> 00:33:29,697
If you do know your
final objective,

449
00:33:29,732 --> 00:33:30,662
you'd be smart
to tell us.

450
00:33:30,697 --> 00:33:33,701
We'll work things
out a lot quicker.

451
00:33:35,703 --> 00:33:37,162
We still
don't know.

452
00:33:37,662 --> 00:33:41,165
You know what they say
about this type of operation...

453
00:33:44,167 --> 00:33:46,169
da! Da!
Da!

454
00:33:52,677 --> 00:33:53,677
Feet.

455
00:33:53,712 --> 00:33:54,678
Hat.

456
00:34:02,184 --> 00:34:03,684
Come on!

457
00:34:10,191 --> 00:34:11,692
Look out!

458
00:34:17,697 --> 00:34:19,664
They sure had me fooled.

459
00:34:19,699 --> 00:34:22,701
The Soviets obviously
know we're here now.

460
00:34:22,736 --> 00:34:24,667
Where to, boss?

461
00:34:24,702 --> 00:34:27,204
First we check
our gasoline supply.

462
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:28,707
How's our
gasoline supply?

463
00:34:28,742 --> 00:34:30,173
85-gallon cans.

464
00:34:30,208 --> 00:34:32,710
Enough to get us
to an airport?

465
00:34:32,745 --> 00:34:34,979
I hope so.
We'll drive in shifts.

466
00:34:35,014 --> 00:34:37,213
One guy'll drive,
the other'll sleep.

467
00:34:37,248 --> 00:34:39,983
Ok. I'll drive,
you sleep.

468
00:34:40,018 --> 00:34:42,719
Wake me up
when you get tired.

469
00:34:42,754 --> 00:34:43,684
Ok.

470
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:45,972
Good night.

471
00:34:46,007 --> 00:34:48,225
Sleep tight.

472
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,692
Thanks.

473
00:34:49,727 --> 00:34:52,228
Don't let
the bedbugs bite.

474
00:34:52,263 --> 00:34:53,746
Ok.

475
00:34:53,781 --> 00:34:55,230
Night.

476
00:35:30,843 --> 00:35:31,844
Good morning.

477
00:35:32,344 --> 00:35:34,846
Is there
an airport near here?

478
00:36:03,873 --> 00:36:06,375
Austin.
Your turn to drive.

479
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:13,880
These are
the Yusufzai.

480
00:36:14,381 --> 00:36:15,882
They're Afghani
freedom-fighters.

481
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:17,885
They're our allies.

482
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:18,886
Oh!

483
00:36:21,388 --> 00:36:23,389
We're Americans!

484
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:40,905
Dr. Hadley!

485
00:36:45,909 --> 00:36:48,411
Oh, my god!

486
00:36:50,912 --> 00:36:52,913
What do you think
you're doing?

487
00:36:56,419 --> 00:36:57,885
Sorry about this.

488
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,422
They're very distrustful
of outsiders.

489
00:37:00,922 --> 00:37:02,389
No problem.

490
00:37:02,424 --> 00:37:05,426
Get your men
to cut them down.

491
00:37:14,934 --> 00:37:16,900
Who are you?

492
00:37:16,935 --> 00:37:18,402
Oh, sorry. Hadley.

493
00:37:18,437 --> 00:37:19,902
London college of medicine.

494
00:37:19,937 --> 00:37:22,940
They only allow us here because
we're helping with the wounded.

495
00:37:22,975 --> 00:37:24,942
They didn't realize
you were with the effort.

496
00:37:24,977 --> 00:37:25,907
With who?

497
00:37:25,942 --> 00:37:28,445
The United Nations
medical effort, of course.

498
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,949
Aren't you doctors
Trowbridge and Greenberg?

499
00:37:30,984 --> 00:37:31,915
Doctors?

500
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:33,916
Yeah, sure,
that's us.

501
00:37:33,951 --> 00:37:36,453
I'm dr. Trowbridge.
This is dr. -

502
00:37:36,488 --> 00:37:37,419
Greenberg.
Greenbaum.

503
00:37:37,454 --> 00:37:38,955
Greenbaumberg.
We're doctors.

504
00:37:40,956 --> 00:37:42,458
Everybody looks
fine here, right?

505
00:37:42,493 --> 00:37:43,958
Yes, doctor.

506
00:37:47,461 --> 00:37:49,965
Stick your
tongue out, please.

507
00:37:53,968 --> 00:37:55,470
Everything's fine.

508
00:37:57,971 --> 00:37:59,937
We'll head back
to the old u. N.

509
00:37:59,972 --> 00:38:03,475
And let them know what
a good job you're doing.

510
00:38:05,477 --> 00:38:06,944
Ah, the American
sense of humor.

511
00:38:06,979 --> 00:38:11,483
Come on. The others are
anxious to meet you.

512
00:38:14,485 --> 00:38:17,488
Have we received the last
shipment of penicillin yet?

513
00:38:17,523 --> 00:38:18,954
Not yet. No.

514
00:38:18,989 --> 00:38:20,740
Possibly
tomorrow.

515
00:38:20,775 --> 00:38:22,491
2 envoys
are coming.

516
00:38:27,998 --> 00:38:29,464
Here we are.

517
00:38:29,499 --> 00:38:31,501
I'm Hadley,
internal medicine.

518
00:38:31,536 --> 00:38:33,467
Dr. La Fong,

519
00:38:33,502 --> 00:38:35,753
communicable diseases.

520
00:38:35,788 --> 00:38:37,970
Dr. Boyer,
bacteriology.

521
00:38:38,005 --> 00:38:40,256
Doctors Stinson,
Marston, and Gill

522
00:38:40,291 --> 00:38:42,473
of the Northampton
trauma institute.

523
00:38:42,508 --> 00:38:45,013
And dr. Imhaus
of the Zurich relief fund.

524
00:38:46,514 --> 00:38:49,516
Our new surgeons,
Trowbridge and Greenbaum.

525
00:38:50,016 --> 00:38:50,517
Doctor.

526
00:38:51,017 --> 00:38:51,518
Doctor.

527
00:38:52,018 --> 00:38:52,983
Doctor.

528
00:38:53,018 --> 00:38:54,520
Doctor.
Doctor.

529
00:38:54,555 --> 00:38:56,986
Doctor.

530
00:38:57,021 --> 00:39:00,023
Doctor.
Doctor.

531
00:39:00,524 --> 00:39:06,530
Doctor.
Doctor.

532
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:07,996
And doctor.

533
00:39:08,031 --> 00:39:09,783
Did we miss anyone?

534
00:39:09,818 --> 00:39:11,500
You gentlemen relax.

535
00:39:11,535 --> 00:39:15,037
The tribe's raiding a Soviet
tank division tomorrow.

536
00:39:15,072 --> 00:39:17,539
There will be plenty
for us to do then.

537
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:19,792
Doctors.

538
00:39:19,827 --> 00:39:22,010
Doctor.

539
00:39:22,045 --> 00:39:23,546
Doctor.
Doctor.

540
00:39:23,581 --> 00:39:25,047
Doctor.

541
00:39:27,048 --> 00:39:31,016
Doctor.

542
00:39:31,051 --> 00:39:36,389
Doctor.
Doctor.

543
00:39:38,393 --> 00:39:39,893
We're not doctors.

544
00:39:40,394 --> 00:39:42,895
We've got to leave
here immediately!

545
00:39:43,396 --> 00:39:45,397
No. Not until I've had-

546
00:39:45,897 --> 00:39:46,898
excuse me.

547
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,365
Her.

548
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,866
Am I interrupting?

549
00:39:50,901 --> 00:39:53,403
No! He was just
on his way out.

550
00:39:57,908 --> 00:40:00,910
What happens when
the real doctors come?

551
00:40:02,911 --> 00:40:03,913
Hi.

552
00:40:04,414 --> 00:40:05,414
Dr. Trowbridge.

553
00:40:05,914 --> 00:40:06,415
Where?

554
00:40:06,915 --> 00:40:07,916
Oh! Right!

555
00:40:08,417 --> 00:40:09,917
Make yourself
comfortable. Sit down.

556
00:40:10,418 --> 00:40:12,419
Thank you.

557
00:40:25,931 --> 00:40:27,898
What can I do for you?

558
00:40:27,933 --> 00:40:30,936
Dr. Trowbridge-
may I call you Homer?

559
00:40:30,971 --> 00:40:31,901
Why?

560
00:40:31,936 --> 00:40:33,440
Well, that's your name.

561
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:35,941
Oh! Right!
Homer. Of course.

562
00:40:35,976 --> 00:40:37,443
What's your name?

563
00:40:37,943 --> 00:40:40,410
Karen.

564
00:40:40,445 --> 00:40:42,411
Dr. Trowbridge...
Homer...

565
00:40:42,446 --> 00:40:45,913
when you walked
into this tent,

566
00:40:45,948 --> 00:40:48,450
it was the most exciting
moment of my life.

567
00:40:48,485 --> 00:40:50,417
Well, you just wait.

568
00:40:50,452 --> 00:40:53,915
You're my hero. I've
read all your papers.

569
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:55,415
How'd you get
my papers?

570
00:40:55,916 --> 00:40:58,418
Oh, you mean
my medical papers!

571
00:40:58,453 --> 00:40:59,419
Are you
making fun of me?

572
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,886
Oh, Karen,
our first fight.

573
00:41:01,921 --> 00:41:04,423
You might think I'm silly
to worship you the way I do,

574
00:41:04,458 --> 00:41:06,890
but in my estimation,
you're a genius.

575
00:41:06,925 --> 00:41:09,928
Well, I think genius
is a pretty strong word,

576
00:41:09,963 --> 00:41:12,932
but if you insist on using it,
I can handle it.

577
00:41:12,967 --> 00:41:15,701
In fact, I hesitate
to mention my problem.

578
00:41:15,736 --> 00:41:18,435
It's a task hardly worthy
of your abilities.

579
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:19,902
Go ahead. Mention it.

580
00:41:19,937 --> 00:41:22,189
There's nothing
I wouldn't do for you.

581
00:41:22,224 --> 00:41:24,441
The khan's brother,
he's been suffering

582
00:41:24,941 --> 00:41:26,442
from pain in
the right lower abdomen,

583
00:41:26,477 --> 00:41:28,445
obviously
an inflamed appendix.

584
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,912
Obviously.

585
00:41:29,947 --> 00:41:32,448
Dr. Hadley was
going to remove it,

586
00:41:32,483 --> 00:41:34,415
but now that
you're here,

587
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:36,952
just to see you perform
even a simple surgery

588
00:41:37,452 --> 00:41:39,954
would be a great thrill
in my life.

589
00:41:39,989 --> 00:41:41,455
I'd really rather not.

590
00:41:41,955 --> 00:41:43,456
I don't have
my instruments with me.

591
00:41:43,491 --> 00:41:44,922
Use dr. Hadley's.

592
00:41:44,957 --> 00:41:48,962
The khan's brother
is being prepped now.

593
00:41:48,997 --> 00:41:50,464
If you refuse
to do this,

594
00:41:50,965 --> 00:41:53,466
the khan will lose
faith in you and us.

595
00:41:53,501 --> 00:41:56,468
The consequences
could be severe.

596
00:41:57,970 --> 00:41:59,435
I see.

597
00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:02,437
Well, the truth is
I am a great surgeon,

598
00:42:02,472 --> 00:42:05,978
but alas, I recently suffered
severe nerve damage

599
00:42:06,013 --> 00:42:07,980
in my left hand.

600
00:42:08,015 --> 00:42:09,946
Oh, my god!

601
00:42:09,981 --> 00:42:11,982
Yeah. Look at that.

602
00:42:12,017 --> 00:42:13,984
No feeling at all.

603
00:42:14,019 --> 00:42:15,449
Dead.

604
00:42:15,484 --> 00:42:17,452
How did that happen?

605
00:42:17,487 --> 00:42:21,489
I was lifting
a car off a child.

606
00:42:21,524 --> 00:42:23,509
It was a big cadillac.

607
00:42:23,544 --> 00:42:25,459
I'm so disappointed.

608
00:42:25,494 --> 00:42:28,496
The khan will be
very suspicious.

609
00:42:28,531 --> 00:42:29,963
My god.

610
00:42:29,998 --> 00:42:32,464
Oh, there, there, there.

611
00:42:32,499 --> 00:42:35,501
Actually, I could
operate without my hands.

612
00:42:35,536 --> 00:42:38,021
Dr. Greenbaum
could be my hands.

613
00:42:38,056 --> 00:42:40,472
I could tell him
what to do.

614
00:42:40,507 --> 00:42:42,508
You would get a chance
see me in action.

615
00:42:42,543 --> 00:42:44,976
That would be
wonderful.

616
00:42:45,011 --> 00:42:49,014
After I guide dr. Greenbaum
through an operation,

617
00:42:49,049 --> 00:42:51,283
I get very depressed.

618
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:53,668
I couldn't
do it myself.

619
00:42:53,703 --> 00:42:55,984
It's a very bad time
for me.

620
00:42:56,019 --> 00:42:59,524
Don't you worry.
I'll be with you.

621
00:43:03,027 --> 00:43:05,028
Give me a break.

622
00:43:09,031 --> 00:43:11,137
About an hour?

623
00:43:11,172 --> 00:43:13,243
Fine. An hour.

624
00:43:14,744 --> 00:43:16,245
Thank you.

625
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:18,248
Bye.

626
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:23,753
You're good with tools,
aren't you? Instruments?

627
00:43:23,788 --> 00:43:27,220
You kidding? You're
talking to Millbarge.

628
00:43:27,255 --> 00:43:29,256
Want something converted,
built, repaired, modified?

629
00:43:29,757 --> 00:43:31,758
You're talking
to Mr. Hands.

630
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:37,265
Ahh. Mind if
I play through?

631
00:43:40,267 --> 00:43:42,518
Doctor. Doctor.

632
00:43:42,553 --> 00:43:44,770
Glad I'm not sick.

633
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:57,282
If anything happens to him,
my people will be angry.

634
00:43:57,317 --> 00:44:00,301
To die in battle
is glorious.

635
00:44:00,336 --> 00:44:03,251
To die in a tent
is disgrace.

636
00:44:03,286 --> 00:44:06,289
And with that, I give you
dr. Julius Greenbaum.

637
00:44:06,324 --> 00:44:08,290
Thank you, doctor.

638
00:44:08,791 --> 00:44:10,293
I'll just step out
for a smoke.

639
00:44:10,328 --> 00:44:12,296
Perhaps
I'll stay here.

640
00:44:12,796 --> 00:44:15,263
Today we'll be removing
the patient's appendix.

641
00:44:15,298 --> 00:44:19,301
The first step in an operation
of this particular type is...

642
00:44:32,813 --> 00:44:35,315
to shave the patient.

643
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:42,820
Nah, forget it,
forget it.

644
00:44:44,821 --> 00:44:49,328
We'll skip the shave
and go to the operation.

645
00:44:49,363 --> 00:44:52,830
The second step
in this operation is...

646
00:44:58,835 --> 00:45:00,337
anesthetic.

647
00:45:02,338 --> 00:45:05,340
But can't you tell
he's already been given

648
00:45:05,375 --> 00:45:07,344
the required injection
of pentothal?

649
00:45:07,379 --> 00:45:08,844
Of course.

650
00:45:09,345 --> 00:45:12,847
He's already been given
the required... injections.

651
00:45:13,348 --> 00:45:16,850
All right. Let us begin
the operation.

652
00:45:36,367 --> 00:45:38,368
Thank you, doctor.

653
00:45:38,868 --> 00:45:41,370
And now,
the first incision.

654
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:51,881
Doctor.

655
00:45:52,382 --> 00:45:53,882
Isn't that incision
a bit high

656
00:45:54,383 --> 00:45:55,849
for an appendix?

657
00:45:55,884 --> 00:45:57,350
Do you want to do
the operation?

658
00:45:57,385 --> 00:45:59,887
Fine! You come on up here,
and you do it!

659
00:45:59,922 --> 00:46:01,355
Imhaus.

660
00:46:01,390 --> 00:46:02,891
He was cutting
into his chest!

661
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:05,393
Did I cut his chest?

662
00:46:05,893 --> 00:46:08,895
I was probing to determining
muscle tone and skeletal girth.

663
00:46:08,930 --> 00:46:10,861
It's a new technique!

664
00:46:10,896 --> 00:46:14,399
We mock what
we don't understand.

665
00:46:14,434 --> 00:46:16,418
Go ahead, will you?

666
00:46:16,453 --> 00:46:18,403
I'm getting hungry.

667
00:46:20,406 --> 00:46:22,908
And now,
the first incision.

668
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:48,930
And now,
I will incise.

669
00:46:55,435 --> 00:46:57,438
Cut the sucker.

670
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:02,942
Ahhhhh...

671
00:47:12,450 --> 00:47:15,454
this man is dead.

672
00:47:50,649 --> 00:47:52,151
Excuse us.

673
00:47:52,186 --> 00:47:53,653
Thank you.

674
00:49:00,209 --> 00:49:02,211
Let me do it!

675
00:49:24,232 --> 00:49:26,233
Emmett!

676
00:49:26,268 --> 00:49:28,235
Help me!

677
00:49:33,238 --> 00:49:34,740
Let go!

678
00:50:25,910 --> 00:50:28,411
The drive-in
is closed.

679
00:50:29,411 --> 00:50:31,914
We're with
the Ace tomato company.

680
00:50:46,927 --> 00:50:49,929
All this
cloak-and-dagger stuff.

681
00:50:49,964 --> 00:50:51,896
The military love it.

682
00:50:51,931 --> 00:50:55,935
Christ, will you
look at this place?

683
00:51:11,951 --> 00:51:13,451
Mr. Ruby.

684
00:51:13,486 --> 00:51:14,452
Sir.

685
00:51:14,953 --> 00:51:15,953
Mr. Keyes.

686
00:51:15,988 --> 00:51:16,954
Yes, sir.

687
00:51:17,454 --> 00:51:20,456
Won't you gentlemen
have a Pepsi?

688
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:44,977
2 pepsis to go.

689
00:51:52,984 --> 00:51:54,450
Now what?

690
00:51:54,485 --> 00:51:58,488
"Why don't you
gentlemen have a Pepsi?"

691
00:52:13,002 --> 00:52:15,004
You do it.

692
00:52:23,509 --> 00:52:27,014
Aaah!
Aaah!

693
00:52:44,029 --> 00:52:45,030
This way,
gentlemen.

694
00:52:51,534 --> 00:52:53,953
Welcome to W. A. M. P.

695
00:53:02,087 --> 00:53:03,588
General sline, sir.

696
00:53:03,623 --> 00:53:05,055
Yes, sergeant?

697
00:53:05,090 --> 00:53:09,092
It's a collect call from
Pakistan for Mr. Ruby

698
00:53:09,127 --> 00:53:10,593
from Mr. Fitz-Hume.

699
00:53:10,628 --> 00:53:11,594
What?

700
00:53:12,094 --> 00:53:14,095
We'll just be
another minute.

701
00:53:14,130 --> 00:53:16,062
Thank you
for your patience.

702
00:53:16,097 --> 00:53:18,599
It's collect. Their
contacts tried to kill them.

703
00:53:19,099 --> 00:53:21,103
They don't know what to do.

704
00:53:21,138 --> 00:53:23,122
And they told you this

705
00:53:23,157 --> 00:53:25,072
over a public phone?

706
00:53:25,107 --> 00:53:27,608
No, sir. AT&T’s operator
told our operator.

707
00:53:27,643 --> 00:53:30,110
They're insane!

708
00:53:30,610 --> 00:53:32,111
And apparently
roaming free.

709
00:53:32,146 --> 00:53:33,630
He's on line 7, sir.

710
00:53:33,665 --> 00:53:35,114
Get us the hell out!

711
00:53:35,613 --> 00:53:38,118
Everything's under
control, Mr. Fitz-Hume.

712
00:53:38,153 --> 00:53:40,084
Hold on one moment.

713
00:53:40,119 --> 00:53:42,585
Look, the longer they're
out in the field,

714
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:45,622
the more heat we can draw
away from the real team.

715
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:50,126
I agree. Let's send them
over the border.

716
00:53:50,161 --> 00:53:52,145
How will
they get there?

717
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:54,157
That's their problem.

718
00:53:54,192 --> 00:53:56,099
Hello, gentlemen.

719
00:53:56,134 --> 00:53:59,636
We're organizing
a rescue operation for you.

720
00:53:59,671 --> 00:54:03,139
For after you've reached
your final objective.

721
00:54:03,174 --> 00:54:04,640
What is
our final objective?

722
00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:07,642
That information is on
a need-to-know basis.

723
00:54:08,143 --> 00:54:11,145
At this particular time,
you do not need to know.

724
00:54:11,180 --> 00:54:12,610
However, we can tell you

725
00:54:12,645 --> 00:54:16,650
to make immediately
for the Soviet Pamir district.

726
00:54:18,652 --> 00:54:22,655
Wait for your next contact
on the road to Dushanbe.

727
00:54:26,658 --> 00:54:28,624
The road to Dushanbe?

728
00:54:28,659 --> 00:54:31,162
You practically told them
the strike zone.

729
00:54:31,197 --> 00:54:33,630
Listen, if they
make it there at all,

730
00:54:33,665 --> 00:54:35,666
they'll be plucked by
Soviet motorized infantry.

731
00:54:35,701 --> 00:54:37,633
The road to Dushanbe

732
00:54:37,668 --> 00:54:39,669
is a heavily traveled
military artery.

733
00:54:40,170 --> 00:54:42,671
I guess that
takes care of that.

734
00:54:43,172 --> 00:54:47,641
We must make
no mistakes this time.

735
00:54:47,676 --> 00:54:51,182
Our whole way of life
hangs in the balance.

736
00:54:58,353 --> 00:54:59,819
Pamir? Dushanbe?

737
00:54:59,854 --> 00:55:02,606
You're sure
that's what he said?

738
00:55:02,641 --> 00:55:05,358
Right. Aren't they
in Russia?

739
00:55:05,393 --> 00:55:06,859
And how!

740
00:55:10,864 --> 00:55:13,332
No, thanks.
I've already eaten.

741
00:55:13,367 --> 00:55:15,868
How can we get there?
It's thousands of miles.

742
00:55:15,903 --> 00:55:18,335
If this is
the lower Kohistan,

743
00:55:18,370 --> 00:55:22,373
we're about 150 miles
from the Soviet border.

744
00:55:22,408 --> 00:55:25,375
You would have to
know that.

745
00:55:25,410 --> 00:55:26,841
Wait a minute!

746
00:55:26,876 --> 00:55:30,129
How do we cross
the Soviet border?

747
00:55:30,164 --> 00:55:33,274
We don't shave,
sell the ambulance,

748
00:55:33,309 --> 00:55:36,385
sell our clothes,
and go native.

749
00:55:49,898 --> 00:55:51,899
How far do we have
to go on this bus?

750
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,901
As far as it
takes us.

751
00:56:04,411 --> 00:56:07,414
Hey, look!
It's dr. Boyer!

752
00:56:14,419 --> 00:56:17,421
She's the last person
we want to see.

753
00:56:17,921 --> 00:56:20,423
No! She's nice.

754
00:56:57,455 --> 00:56:59,459
What's this, the border?

755
00:56:59,494 --> 00:57:00,925
No. Toll stop.

756
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:04,629
Hopefully, there won't be
guard posts where we cross.

757
00:57:07,131 --> 00:57:08,096
Look.

758
00:57:08,131 --> 00:57:10,133
Dr. Boyer.

759
00:57:12,134 --> 00:57:14,136
Leave it alone.

760
00:57:23,144 --> 00:57:25,647
I left without
saying good-bye.

761
00:57:27,648 --> 00:57:29,650
Where are you going?

762
00:57:30,150 --> 00:57:33,152
You can't deny what
happened between us.

763
00:57:33,653 --> 00:57:36,658
Don't touch me.
Come on.

764
00:57:43,162 --> 00:57:45,163
"Don't touch me."

765
00:57:58,175 --> 00:58:01,177
Look at this.
It's really neat.

766
00:58:04,179 --> 00:58:07,182
How can she let a little death
interfere with romance?

767
00:58:07,217 --> 00:58:09,684
They couldn't
have done better.

768
00:58:09,719 --> 00:58:11,704
They aren't doctors.

769
00:58:11,739 --> 00:58:13,654
What do you mean?

770
00:58:13,689 --> 00:58:17,191
That metal case she was
packing on her horse.

771
00:58:17,226 --> 00:58:18,156
What about it?

772
00:58:18,191 --> 00:58:19,694
It's a Satscrambler
terminal.

773
00:58:20,194 --> 00:58:21,194
Sophisticated equipment
for sending, scrambling,

774
00:58:21,695 --> 00:58:23,697
and receiving
satellite messages.

775
00:58:24,196 --> 00:58:25,698
So she's
a sophisticated woman.

776
00:58:26,198 --> 00:58:27,699
It's a highly
classified piece

777
00:58:28,199 --> 00:58:29,701
of intelligence
hardware.

778
00:58:30,204 --> 00:58:32,706
She's a high-class
intelligent piece.

779
00:58:33,206 --> 00:58:34,707
Knock it off.

780
00:58:35,207 --> 00:58:37,709
You're saying that
they're spies like us?

781
00:58:38,209 --> 00:58:41,712
They're spies, but not
necessarily on our side.

782
00:58:43,714 --> 00:58:46,216
I think it's our duty
as American operatives

783
00:58:46,717 --> 00:58:49,220
to follow her and
find out what she's up to.

784
00:58:49,721 --> 00:58:51,221
You just want
to follow her.

785
00:58:51,722 --> 00:58:52,222
No.

786
00:58:52,723 --> 00:58:54,724
You're thinking
with your dick.

787
00:58:55,224 --> 00:58:57,226
They left their
land rover here.

788
00:58:57,726 --> 00:58:59,227
They're probably
headed for the border.

789
00:58:59,262 --> 00:59:01,729
It would save us
a lot of trouble.

790
00:59:02,229 --> 00:59:05,231
They seem to be headed
in that direction.

791
00:59:05,266 --> 00:59:07,105
Maybe your dick's
not so dumb.

792
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:08,944
Got me through
high school.

793
00:59:22,914 --> 00:59:25,919
Do you think those men
are following us?

794
00:59:28,921 --> 00:59:31,422
They're most likely
Chitrali nomads.

795
00:59:31,457 --> 00:59:32,924
Not to worry.

796
00:59:51,439 --> 00:59:52,941
Did you say sit?

797
00:59:53,441 --> 00:59:54,692
I didn't say sit.

798
00:59:54,727 --> 00:59:55,908
Did you say sit?

799
00:59:55,943 --> 00:59:58,444
No, I didn't say sit.
What-

800
01:00:04,450 --> 01:00:05,918
now what?

801
01:00:05,953 --> 01:00:08,454
I guess we walk.

802
01:00:36,978 --> 01:00:39,948
Why do we have to carry
all this stuff?

803
01:00:39,983 --> 01:00:42,985
The Dushanbe road runs across
the top of the mountains.

804
01:00:43,020 --> 01:00:45,486
It'll be sub-arctic
temperatures up there.

805
01:00:45,521 --> 01:00:47,505
You'll thank me.

806
01:00:47,540 --> 01:00:49,489
"You'll thank me."

807
01:01:20,516 --> 01:01:21,482
That's it.

808
01:01:21,517 --> 01:01:23,483
The Dushanbe road...

809
01:01:23,518 --> 01:01:27,022
where we're supposed
to meet our contacts...

810
01:01:27,057 --> 01:01:28,523
I hope.

811
01:01:33,987 --> 01:01:37,323
Only insofar as it
serves to confirm

812
01:01:37,358 --> 01:01:39,248
the president's
own beliefs.

813
01:01:39,283 --> 01:01:42,250
This is quite
an exciting project.

814
01:01:42,285 --> 01:01:44,286
What was the cost of
this star wars system?

815
01:01:44,321 --> 01:01:46,288
Just under
$60 billion.

816
01:01:46,323 --> 01:01:47,253
Quite a bargain.

817
01:01:47,288 --> 01:01:50,041
Sir, printout
from gravsat.

818
01:01:50,076 --> 01:01:52,795
A transmission
from the field,

819
01:01:52,830 --> 01:01:54,296
your GLG-20s.

820
01:01:54,796 --> 01:01:56,298
Well, wonderful.
They confirm

821
01:01:56,797 --> 01:01:59,300
estimated arrival
at the strike site

822
01:01:59,335 --> 01:02:01,266
by 6 p. M.
Their time tomorrow.

823
01:02:01,301 --> 01:02:04,303
That's 9 a. M. Here.
Right on schedule.

824
01:02:04,804 --> 01:02:08,306
You can always
count on our people.

825
01:02:16,315 --> 01:02:18,281
Well, this is it.

826
01:02:18,316 --> 01:02:21,319
Where are those contacts
we heard so much about?

827
01:02:21,354 --> 01:02:23,821
Did they say where
on the road?

828
01:02:23,856 --> 01:02:25,287
No.

829
01:02:25,322 --> 01:02:28,075
Maybe we should
start hitchhiking.

830
01:02:28,110 --> 01:02:30,970
We're inside
the Soviet union.

831
01:02:31,005 --> 01:02:33,795
I wish we hadn't
lost Boyer.

832
01:02:33,830 --> 01:02:37,332
They had horses.
We were on foot!

833
01:02:53,847 --> 01:02:55,849
It's the tadzhik
highway patrol.

834
01:02:56,849 --> 01:02:59,816
They were just
sitting there.

835
01:02:59,851 --> 01:03:01,853
They heard our
entire conversation.

836
01:03:03,857 --> 01:03:05,824
What are they saying?

837
01:03:05,859 --> 01:03:08,861
He says we needn't
bother whispering.

838
01:03:08,896 --> 01:03:11,130
Let's get
out of here.

839
01:03:11,165 --> 01:03:13,329
They'll cut us down.

840
01:03:13,364 --> 01:03:15,115
We can't just
go with them.

841
01:03:15,150 --> 01:03:16,867
What other choice
do we have?

842
01:03:16,902 --> 01:03:18,368
If we give ourselves up,

843
01:03:18,869 --> 01:03:20,369
the state department
will get us home.

844
01:03:20,404 --> 01:03:21,871
Not me!

845
01:03:28,878 --> 01:03:30,879
Hi! Just me.

846
01:03:55,399 --> 01:03:57,901
I was just looking for
the Burt Reynolds theater.

847
01:04:01,907 --> 01:04:03,908
Don't I get
a phone call?

848
01:04:12,915 --> 01:04:14,917
And who do you
intend to call?

849
01:04:20,923 --> 01:04:22,889
Goddamn it!

850
01:04:22,924 --> 01:04:24,926
He gives himself up!

851
01:04:28,929 --> 01:04:30,429
What is
your objective?

852
01:04:30,464 --> 01:04:31,896
My objective?

853
01:04:31,931 --> 01:04:34,934
Well, I object to
buying a girl dinner,

854
01:04:34,969 --> 01:04:38,438
then she won't
put out for you.

855
01:04:39,939 --> 01:04:41,941
Why are you here?

856
01:04:42,441 --> 01:04:43,942
Why am I here?

857
01:04:44,442 --> 01:04:45,943
Why are you here?

858
01:04:46,443 --> 01:04:48,445
Why is anybody here?
I think Sartre said-

859
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:49,911
how do you spell Sartre?

860
01:04:49,946 --> 01:04:51,913
Ow! And let that
be a lesson to you!

861
01:04:51,948 --> 01:04:54,953
Every minute you don't
tell us why you're here,

862
01:04:55,453 --> 01:04:57,454
I cut off a finger.

863
01:04:57,489 --> 01:04:58,455
Mine or yours?

864
01:04:58,490 --> 01:04:59,953
Yours.

865
01:04:59,988 --> 01:05:01,416
Damn!

866
01:05:01,917 --> 01:05:03,418
Why are you
still hitting me?

867
01:05:03,453 --> 01:05:04,919
He's going to cut
my fingers off!

868
01:05:04,954 --> 01:05:06,419
You have 30 seconds.

869
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:08,421
You're not gonna hum
the jeopardy theme?

870
01:05:08,456 --> 01:05:11,692
We start with
the little one.

871
01:05:11,727 --> 01:05:14,928
All right!
I'm an American agent.

872
01:05:14,963 --> 01:05:15,928
And?

873
01:05:16,428 --> 01:05:18,395
And, uh...
and, uh...

874
01:05:18,430 --> 01:05:21,933
they sent me here
to assassinate your premier.

875
01:05:21,968 --> 01:05:23,899
I knew it!
Pay up, comrade.

876
01:05:23,934 --> 01:05:26,436
Let's cut his
fingers off anyway.

877
01:05:26,471 --> 01:05:28,403
No.

878
01:05:28,438 --> 01:05:31,443
Let's take him to
headquarters in Moscow.

879
01:05:31,478 --> 01:05:33,444
Good move.
Good move.

880
01:05:33,479 --> 01:05:34,445
Headquarters.

881
01:05:38,614 --> 01:05:41,116
It shouldn't be much further.
We've made good time.

882
01:05:41,151 --> 01:05:43,117
We'll go on foot
from here.

883
01:06:11,643 --> 01:06:14,145
Ow! Ohh!

884
01:06:14,645 --> 01:06:16,646
Whoa!

885
01:06:24,153 --> 01:06:26,656
Goddamn it!

886
01:06:26,691 --> 01:06:28,658
Whoa!

887
01:06:35,163 --> 01:06:37,914
Ah-ahh-ahhh!

888
01:06:37,949 --> 01:06:40,666
Whoa! Whoa!

889
01:06:44,172 --> 01:06:45,637
Hi!

890
01:06:45,672 --> 01:06:47,924
How you doing?
Remember me?

891
01:06:47,959 --> 01:06:52,143
What are you
doing here?

892
01:06:52,178 --> 01:06:55,181
They surprised us.
Border troops.

893
01:06:55,216 --> 01:06:56,699
They got my partner.

894
01:06:56,734 --> 01:06:58,183
Did they
get you, too?

895
01:06:58,218 --> 01:07:00,149
I'm fine!

896
01:07:00,184 --> 01:07:03,188
No wonder neither
of you could operate.

897
01:07:03,688 --> 01:07:04,689
You're spies like us!

898
01:07:05,190 --> 01:07:06,155
You mean, you're-

899
01:07:06,190 --> 01:07:08,691
Austin Millbarge.
I'm a GLG-20.

900
01:07:09,192 --> 01:07:10,158
So...

901
01:07:10,193 --> 01:07:13,196
you two are
the other GLG-20s.

902
01:07:13,231 --> 01:07:14,464
The decoys.

903
01:07:14,499 --> 01:07:15,662
Decoys!

904
01:07:15,697 --> 01:07:17,199
Lower your voice.

905
01:07:17,699 --> 01:07:19,200
That's why they rushed
us through training,

906
01:07:19,702 --> 01:07:21,169
why we were met
by the KGB,

907
01:07:21,204 --> 01:07:24,206
why they sent us
into enemy hands.

908
01:07:24,241 --> 01:07:25,171
Right.

909
01:07:25,206 --> 01:07:27,457
I am-extremely
pissed off!

910
01:07:27,492 --> 01:07:29,709
My partner and I
were set up!

911
01:07:30,210 --> 01:07:32,176
Forget it!
That's behind us!

912
01:07:32,211 --> 01:07:34,713
Our first priority
is to cover those bodies,

913
01:07:35,213 --> 01:07:37,466
establish
a new base camp,

914
01:07:37,501 --> 01:07:39,861
and complete
this project.

915
01:07:39,896 --> 01:07:42,560
Fitz-Hume's
in the custody

916
01:07:42,595 --> 01:07:45,224
of the tadzhik
highway patrol

917
01:07:45,259 --> 01:07:46,690
because of you.

918
01:07:46,725 --> 01:07:49,227
The only project
I have to complete

919
01:07:49,262 --> 01:07:51,229
is to get
my partner out.

920
01:08:08,244 --> 01:08:11,246
Fitz-Hume!

921
01:08:24,758 --> 01:08:26,759
Come on!

922
01:08:37,270 --> 01:08:39,772
Look! Did you do that?

923
01:08:40,272 --> 01:08:41,773
Yeah. I did that
for you.

924
01:09:08,294 --> 01:09:10,298
You know, I must
really like you,

925
01:09:10,333 --> 01:09:11,799
because I don't
like horses,

926
01:09:11,834 --> 01:09:13,300
and I hate guns.

927
01:09:32,818 --> 01:09:33,819
What's this?

928
01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:36,320
You don't want it!

929
01:09:43,826 --> 01:09:45,829
Aah!
Aah!

930
01:09:45,864 --> 01:09:47,597
Aah!

931
01:09:47,632 --> 01:09:49,331
Duck!

932
01:10:03,342 --> 01:10:05,345
I'll get the horse.

933
01:10:17,854 --> 01:10:19,355
Let's go!

934
01:10:21,858 --> 01:10:23,863
Hi-ho, silver!
Away!

935
01:11:00,810 --> 01:11:05,278
It’s soul finger
by the bar-kays.

936
01:11:05,313 --> 01:11:07,814
They must be having
trouble getting gigs.

937
01:11:22,829 --> 01:11:24,330
Wow!

938
01:11:26,832 --> 01:11:30,335
This is a Soviet
icbm site.

939
01:11:35,340 --> 01:11:38,342
Austin: That's
an SS-50 long-range rocket

940
01:11:38,377 --> 01:11:39,843
and mobile launcher.

941
01:11:44,847 --> 01:11:46,314
They just moved it
in here.

942
01:11:46,349 --> 01:11:48,850
Haven't even put up
their locator beacon.

943
01:11:48,885 --> 01:11:51,352
Means they're not hooked
into Soviet defense.

944
01:11:51,387 --> 01:11:52,853
They are radio-isolated.

945
01:11:52,888 --> 01:11:53,856
Only 3 men.

946
01:11:55,857 --> 01:11:56,858
And their mother.

947
01:12:08,867 --> 01:12:09,868
Oh!

948
01:12:14,374 --> 01:12:14,874
Let me see that.

949
01:12:15,375 --> 01:12:16,876
Hey!

950
01:12:16,911 --> 01:12:18,377
Come on!

951
01:12:28,384 --> 01:12:29,350
Honestly!

952
01:12:29,385 --> 01:12:31,353
You two
are unbelievable!

953
01:12:31,388 --> 01:12:33,891
Wait a minute.
What are we doing here?

954
01:12:33,926 --> 01:12:36,358
This is our final objective.

955
01:12:36,393 --> 01:12:38,394
Our project orders
are to subdue the crew

956
01:12:38,894 --> 01:12:40,860
and seize control
of this emplacement.

957
01:12:40,895 --> 01:12:43,397
Hold it, sister. We're
not going near that thing.

958
01:12:43,432 --> 01:12:45,899
That missile has
a 40-megaton nuclear warhead.

959
01:12:45,934 --> 01:12:47,418
Good night,
everybody.

960
01:12:47,453 --> 01:12:48,903
Where are you going?

961
01:12:48,938 --> 01:12:49,869
Home.

962
01:12:49,904 --> 01:12:51,905
For once, I'm in
complete agreement.

963
01:12:51,940 --> 01:12:53,871
We should get up and
leave immediately.

964
01:12:53,906 --> 01:12:56,158
Those things can suck
the paint off your house

965
01:12:56,193 --> 01:12:58,410
and give your family
a permanent orange afro.

966
01:12:58,445 --> 01:13:00,378
I don't what you two do,

967
01:13:00,413 --> 01:13:02,879
but I'm fulfilling
my obligation.

968
01:13:02,914 --> 01:13:04,915
I intend to go down there
and seize control

969
01:13:05,416 --> 01:13:07,420
of that emplacement,
alone if I have to.

970
01:13:07,455 --> 01:13:09,439
You know we'd do
anything for you,

971
01:13:09,474 --> 01:13:11,423
but we can't
seize that rocket.

972
01:13:11,923 --> 01:13:13,425
We'd have to kill
everybody down there.

973
01:13:13,460 --> 01:13:15,426
I'm not
killing anybody.

974
01:13:15,461 --> 01:13:16,927
I'm not, either.

975
01:13:23,432 --> 01:13:27,437
Gentlemen, I think
you both should realize

976
01:13:27,472 --> 01:13:28,903
the gravity
of this moment.

977
01:13:28,938 --> 01:13:31,940
I've spent the last
21/2 years of my life

978
01:13:31,975 --> 01:13:33,407
preparing for
this penetration.

979
01:13:33,442 --> 01:13:36,944
This afternoon, I buried
my partner Jerry Hadley,

980
01:13:36,979 --> 01:13:39,946
perhaps the finest,
most dedicated GLG-20

981
01:13:39,981 --> 01:13:41,912
in the history
of the service.

982
01:13:41,947 --> 01:13:44,449
He is now entombed
in a snowy grave,

983
01:13:44,484 --> 01:13:47,469
and it's not gonna be
for nothing.

984
01:13:47,504 --> 01:13:50,420
We are here today
to guarantee

985
01:13:50,455 --> 01:13:52,957
the personal freedom
of every American.

986
01:13:52,992 --> 01:13:54,924
And we should never forget

987
01:13:54,959 --> 01:13:56,925
the words of president
john f. Kennedy

988
01:13:56,960 --> 01:14:00,963
who said, "ask not what
your country can do for you,

989
01:14:01,467 --> 01:14:03,968
but what you can do
for your country."

990
01:14:06,970 --> 01:14:08,972
Will you marry me?

991
01:14:16,478 --> 01:14:18,444
Now...

992
01:14:18,479 --> 01:14:21,984
these are high-compression
tranquilizer pistols.

993
01:14:22,019 --> 01:14:24,986
We're not going
to kill anybody,

994
01:14:25,487 --> 01:14:29,990
but you've got to get
in close to use them.

995
01:14:41,667 --> 01:14:45,169
Hours-t-minus 2 until
designated target apogee.

996
01:14:47,171 --> 01:14:50,173
Sir, all air traffic
has been diverted

997
01:14:50,208 --> 01:14:52,641
from our
response corridor.

998
01:14:52,676 --> 01:14:54,677
What's our present
on-line power reading?

999
01:14:56,181 --> 01:14:58,182
Michigan reactor
and Washington state

1000
01:14:58,217 --> 01:15:00,183
atomic plants
on-line, general.

1001
01:15:01,685 --> 01:15:03,686
lock us in, sergeant.

1002
01:15:11,692 --> 01:15:13,193
W. A. M. P. Secure, sir.

1003
01:15:13,693 --> 01:15:15,162
All right.

1004
01:15:15,197 --> 01:15:18,700
Let's go to
response level yellow.

1005
01:15:18,735 --> 01:15:20,701
Initiating level yellow.

1006
01:15:50,224 --> 01:15:52,730
Run your full servo
and arming.

1007
01:16:30,260 --> 01:16:33,262
Servo on and armed.

1008
01:16:58,785 --> 01:17:00,250
Ah...

1009
01:17:00,285 --> 01:17:01,788
soul finger!

1010
01:17:07,293 --> 01:17:09,295
Soul finger.

1011
01:17:47,828 --> 01:17:49,328
What's she saying?

1012
01:17:49,829 --> 01:17:52,831
Hair... hairbrush...
headrest...

1013
01:17:53,331 --> 01:17:55,835
where did you learn your
Russian, J. C. Penney?

1014
01:18:03,342 --> 01:18:04,843
When she was a child
in Lithuania,

1015
01:18:05,344 --> 01:18:06,344
her uncle used to tell a story
about strange beings

1016
01:18:06,844 --> 01:18:10,847
that came down from
a disc and stole an ox

1017
01:18:10,882 --> 01:18:14,850
which the village had
put aside for roasting.

1018
01:18:14,885 --> 01:18:16,620
I told you
it would work.

1019
01:18:16,655 --> 01:18:18,355
Everybody knows
about ufos.

1020
01:18:18,855 --> 01:18:21,858
Apparently, the aliens
dissected the ox

1021
01:18:22,359 --> 01:18:24,860
and kept the best pieces
of meat for themselves.

1022
01:18:24,895 --> 01:18:26,861
So we owe them
a cow.

1023
01:18:27,862 --> 01:18:30,364
Where do we get one?

1024
01:18:52,383 --> 01:18:53,886
Nee nee nee!
De de de!

1025
01:19:02,850 --> 01:19:04,601
Do what I do.

1026
01:19:04,636 --> 01:19:06,353
Aah! Aah! Aah!

1027
01:19:06,853 --> 01:19:08,855
Aah! Aah! Aah!

1028
01:19:14,862 --> 01:19:18,365
Aah!

1029
01:19:37,798 --> 01:19:40,383
Satscram signal
from the strike site.

1030
01:19:40,418 --> 01:19:42,969
Your GLG-20s have
penetrated successfully

1031
01:19:43,004 --> 01:19:44,435
and are awaiting
the go-code.

1032
01:19:44,470 --> 01:19:46,972
Open and lock down
ground deflectors.

1033
01:20:23,461 --> 01:20:26,466
Ground deflectors
opened and locked.

1034
01:20:40,477 --> 01:20:42,478
Ok, Dostoevsky,
what does it say?

1035
01:20:42,980 --> 01:20:43,981
It says...

1036
01:20:44,482 --> 01:20:46,483
"approach SS-50...

1037
01:20:46,983 --> 01:20:49,985
source programmable
rocket."

1038
01:20:57,991 --> 01:20:58,991
Easy.

1039
01:20:59,492 --> 01:21:03,998
"Find control box
at front of transporter."

1040
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:08,966
This is a snap.

1041
01:21:09,001 --> 01:21:13,004
"For erector panel,
push red button."

1042
01:21:25,516 --> 01:21:27,984
"Depress red key switch.

1043
01:21:28,019 --> 01:21:30,479
Enter first
numbered sequence."

1044
01:21:30,514 --> 01:21:31,480
Go.

1045
01:21:31,980 --> 01:21:34,447
"3-3-9...

1046
01:21:34,482 --> 01:21:37,484
"dash 2-5-9...

1047
01:21:37,519 --> 01:21:38,987
dash 6."

1048
01:21:40,989 --> 01:21:43,956
"Acknowledge compliance
on Satscram now."

1049
01:21:43,991 --> 01:21:46,993
GLG-20s acknowledge
programming and compliance.

1050
01:21:47,493 --> 01:21:49,995
Bring all birds
into final bounce mode.

1051
01:22:52,550 --> 01:22:54,052
Bounce mode engaged.

1052
01:22:54,552 --> 01:22:58,054
Send them the go-code.

1053
01:23:11,941 --> 01:23:14,944
"Go with numbered
sequence 7-4...

1054
01:23:14,979 --> 01:23:17,714
"dash 7-4...

1055
01:23:17,749 --> 01:23:20,349
"dash 8-8-3...

1056
01:23:20,384 --> 01:23:22,950
dash 5, dash 3."

1057
01:24:27,007 --> 01:24:29,008
Sac-com confirms
an outbound blip

1058
01:24:29,043 --> 01:24:30,509
from Soviet central Asia.

1059
01:24:30,544 --> 01:24:32,475
It's on its way.

1060
01:24:32,510 --> 01:24:34,012
Override all sac alerts

1061
01:24:34,511 --> 01:24:36,514
with error stand down orders
for 10 minutes.

1062
01:24:38,015 --> 01:24:40,017
Sac override code
entered.

1063
01:24:40,052 --> 01:24:42,020
Error. Stand down.

1064
01:25:14,047 --> 01:25:15,547
I think we just started
world war iii.

1065
01:25:20,053 --> 01:25:25,056
She wants to know why
we would do such a thing.

1066
01:25:25,091 --> 01:25:27,557
Tell her
so do we.

1067
01:25:40,070 --> 01:25:41,570
What are they
saying?

1068
01:25:41,605 --> 01:25:43,072
It's 4:47 a. M.

1069
01:25:43,572 --> 01:25:45,038
They're saying it'll be
28 minutes

1070
01:25:45,073 --> 01:25:47,575
before the rocket detonates
above its target

1071
01:25:47,610 --> 01:25:50,077
somewhere inside
the continental United States.

1072
01:25:54,082 --> 01:25:56,050
Let's see-28 minutes.

1073
01:25:56,085 --> 01:25:58,086
That's 18 until it's
inside the u. S. Radar cup.

1074
01:25:58,121 --> 01:26:00,605
Figure 2
for our response,

1075
01:26:00,640 --> 01:26:03,090
say,20 until
total commitment.

1076
01:26:03,590 --> 01:26:05,056
Figure 20,22

1077
01:26:05,091 --> 01:26:06,592
until the first impact
of our retaliatory strike.

1078
01:26:06,627 --> 01:26:09,559
I figure
we have 42 minutes

1079
01:26:09,594 --> 01:26:12,098
until the end of civilization
as we know it.

1080
01:26:16,601 --> 01:26:18,602
You want to go out
with a bang?

1081
01:26:18,637 --> 01:26:20,621
I beg your pardon?

1082
01:26:20,656 --> 01:26:22,571
It was just an idea.

1083
01:26:22,606 --> 01:26:24,107
You know, if we were
sitting in a bar,

1084
01:26:24,607 --> 01:26:26,609
I'd throw a drink
right in your face...

1085
01:26:30,114 --> 01:26:32,865
but under
the circumstances,

1086
01:26:32,900 --> 01:26:35,617
it's not such
a bad idea.

1087
01:28:15,912 --> 01:28:17,913
Release full pulse.

1088
01:28:17,948 --> 01:28:19,416
3...

1089
01:28:19,917 --> 01:28:21,417
2...

1090
01:28:22,418 --> 01:28:23,669
1.

1091
01:28:23,704 --> 01:28:24,920
Fire!

1092
01:28:35,929 --> 01:28:38,433
Bounce pulse failed to
connect with target, sir.

1093
01:28:39,434 --> 01:28:41,435
Just what are you
saying, soldier?

1094
01:28:41,470 --> 01:28:42,436
We missed it, sir.

1095
01:28:42,937 --> 01:28:43,902
What?

1096
01:28:43,937 --> 01:28:46,939
We missed the rocket.
It didn't work.

1097
01:28:46,974 --> 01:28:49,906
Didn't work?
Where did the pulse go?

1098
01:28:49,941 --> 01:28:51,943
I don't know, sir, but
it definitely didn't connect

1099
01:28:51,978 --> 01:28:52,944
with the inbound traffic.

1100
01:29:02,453 --> 01:29:03,919
Wow!

1101
01:29:03,954 --> 01:29:04,955
Excellent!

1102
01:29:09,458 --> 01:29:10,959
We'd better
call the president.

1103
01:29:10,994 --> 01:29:11,925
We're not calling anyone.

1104
01:29:11,960 --> 01:29:13,962
What do you mean,
we're not calling anyone?

1105
01:29:13,997 --> 01:29:16,231
The president must know
that this attack

1106
01:29:16,266 --> 01:29:18,466
was not initiated
by the Soviet union.

1107
01:29:21,969 --> 01:29:24,971
We are prepared
for this contingency.

1108
01:29:25,006 --> 01:29:27,973
What in hell do you
intend to do?

1109
01:29:28,473 --> 01:29:30,440
You understand, sir,
that we are responsible

1110
01:29:30,475 --> 01:29:32,981
for launching a nuclear weapon
against our own country?

1111
01:29:33,016 --> 01:29:34,999
No one outside
this command center

1112
01:29:35,034 --> 01:29:36,948
has that information,
gentlemen.

1113
01:29:36,983 --> 01:29:39,985
When we commissioned
the schmectel corporation

1114
01:29:40,020 --> 01:29:42,987
to research this precise
event sequence scenario,

1115
01:29:43,487 --> 01:29:45,489
it was determined that
the continual stockpiling

1116
01:29:45,524 --> 01:29:46,990
and development
of our nuclear arsenal

1117
01:29:47,025 --> 01:29:48,957
was becoming
self-defeating.

1118
01:29:48,992 --> 01:29:52,996
A weapon unused
is a useless weapon.

1119
01:29:53,031 --> 01:29:54,462
Sac-com confirms

1120
01:29:54,497 --> 01:29:56,000
all defense systems
commitment ready.

1121
01:29:56,499 --> 01:29:57,500
We have verification.

1122
01:29:58,001 --> 01:30:00,502
The president is aboard
the airborne command center.

1123
01:30:00,537 --> 01:30:03,504
I'm sure it will only be
a matter of minutes

1124
01:30:04,005 --> 01:30:07,007
before the president
commits to total release.

1125
01:30:09,511 --> 01:30:12,013
Jesus Christ!

1126
01:30:16,515 --> 01:30:19,482
You see, we had to show

1127
01:30:19,517 --> 01:30:22,521
that we had
the technical capability

1128
01:30:22,556 --> 01:30:24,487
and were determined.

1129
01:30:24,522 --> 01:30:28,028
History demonstrates
conclusively

1130
01:30:28,063 --> 01:30:30,797
that naive
wishing for peace

1131
01:30:30,832 --> 01:30:33,182
is the surest
possible way

1132
01:30:33,217 --> 01:30:35,533
to encourage
an aggressor.

1133
01:30:36,034 --> 01:30:36,999
I demand you place me

1134
01:30:37,034 --> 01:30:38,535
in immediate communication
with the president!

1135
01:30:38,570 --> 01:30:40,001
Relax, Mr. Ruby.

1136
01:30:40,036 --> 01:30:42,003
This facility is more than
adequately stocked

1137
01:30:42,038 --> 01:30:45,040
for a comfortable 17 months
of below-ground existence.

1138
01:30:45,075 --> 01:30:46,542
We'll be fine.

1139
01:30:47,043 --> 01:30:48,009
By your actions, sir,

1140
01:30:48,044 --> 01:30:50,546
you are risking the future
of the human race!

1141
01:30:52,048 --> 01:30:54,049
To guarantee
the American way of life...

1142
01:30:55,550 --> 01:30:58,552
I'm willing
to take that risk.

1143
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:11,021
It's hard to believe
it's been only 15 minutes

1144
01:31:11,056 --> 01:31:12,488
since I destroyed
the world.

1145
01:31:12,523 --> 01:31:16,275
In another 15 minutes,
it will all be over.

1146
01:31:16,310 --> 01:31:20,028
It's such a short time
to destroy a world.

1147
01:31:20,529 --> 01:31:22,033
And to think my high school
guidance counselor

1148
01:31:22,068 --> 01:31:24,034
said I'd never
amount to anything.

1149
01:31:24,069 --> 01:31:26,000
It just goes to show-

1150
01:31:26,035 --> 01:31:29,038
guidance! Source
programmable guidance!

1151
01:31:29,073 --> 01:31:31,307
Fitz-Hume! Boyer!

1152
01:31:31,342 --> 01:31:33,541
Get up! Get up!

1153
01:31:37,544 --> 01:31:39,545
Come on! Come on!

1154
01:31:39,580 --> 01:31:41,065
Come on!

1155
01:31:41,100 --> 01:31:42,826
Fitz-Hume!

1156
01:31:42,861 --> 01:31:45,207
Boyer!

1157
01:31:45,242 --> 01:31:47,554
Um...

1158
01:31:52,557 --> 01:31:54,559
wait a minute!
What's going on here?

1159
01:31:54,594 --> 01:31:55,525
You have a tent?

1160
01:31:55,560 --> 01:31:57,062
Bring me
the Satscram dish.

1161
01:31:57,097 --> 01:31:58,330
I think we can
recall it.

1162
01:31:58,365 --> 01:31:59,715
What do you mean,
recall it?

1163
01:31:59,750 --> 01:32:01,065
You mean like
a defective pinto?

1164
01:32:03,567 --> 01:32:05,068
Take this up.

1165
01:32:05,569 --> 01:32:06,569
Up. Climb.

1166
01:32:08,571 --> 01:32:11,574
Grab a rock.
Grab a hammer.

1167
01:32:11,609 --> 01:32:12,539
We can divert it.

1168
01:32:12,574 --> 01:32:14,576
It's made to respond
to in-flight commands.

1169
01:32:14,611 --> 01:32:16,545
Here's a rock.

1170
01:32:16,580 --> 01:32:18,081
Go to the Satscram
terminal.

1171
01:32:19,582 --> 01:32:21,549
Now what?

1172
01:32:21,584 --> 01:32:23,084
Smash that thing!

1173
01:32:26,587 --> 01:32:28,338
It's broken.

1174
01:32:28,373 --> 01:32:30,232
Bring it here.

1175
01:32:30,267 --> 01:32:32,091
Not the rock.

1176
01:32:34,593 --> 01:32:37,097
What's the use? It's
probably all over anyway.

1177
01:32:37,132 --> 01:32:38,564
No, no, no.

1178
01:32:38,599 --> 01:32:41,100
All we have to do is
switch sending boards.

1179
01:32:43,602 --> 01:32:45,568
Ok.

1180
01:32:45,603 --> 01:32:48,105
Start sending the launch
sequence in reverse order.

1181
01:32:48,140 --> 01:32:49,105
Yes, sir.

1182
01:32:56,613 --> 01:32:57,579
Fitz-Hume...

1183
01:32:57,614 --> 01:32:59,580
hold these together.

1184
01:32:59,615 --> 01:33:02,117
I've got
to make the splice.

1185
01:33:02,152 --> 01:33:03,636
Hold it together.

1186
01:33:03,671 --> 01:33:05,120
Ow! I got a shock.

1187
01:33:05,620 --> 01:33:06,586
And you will.

1188
01:33:06,621 --> 01:33:08,122
I don't care
how painful it is,

1189
01:33:08,157 --> 01:33:09,623
you've got
to hold them together.

1190
01:33:09,658 --> 01:33:11,124
You are the circuit bridge.

1191
01:33:11,159 --> 01:33:12,894
B- b-but...

1192
01:33:12,929 --> 01:33:14,595
I need, uh...

1193
01:33:14,630 --> 01:33:16,130
bigger
than a bread box?

1194
01:33:16,165 --> 01:33:18,097
I need, uh, uh...

1195
01:33:18,132 --> 01:33:19,633
the title
of a movie?

1196
01:33:22,635 --> 01:33:24,136
Animals and
their natural habitats?

1197
01:33:24,171 --> 01:33:26,102
The title of a book?

1198
01:33:26,137 --> 01:33:27,639
Things that are being
electrocuted?

1199
01:33:27,674 --> 01:33:29,643
I got it!

1200
01:33:39,149 --> 01:33:41,150
Miles-

1201
01:33:41,185 --> 01:33:42,919
5.

1202
01:33:42,954 --> 01:33:46,655
Zero.

1203
01:33:54,663 --> 01:33:55,628
We did it!

1204
01:33:55,663 --> 01:33:58,666
We did?
We did it!

1205
01:34:00,668 --> 01:34:03,635
Can I borrow your tent?

1206
01:34:03,670 --> 01:34:07,676
Sac-com confirms
destruction of the inbound.

1207
01:34:07,711 --> 01:34:09,176
What about the rest
of their inbounds?

1208
01:34:09,211 --> 01:34:10,643
There are none, sir.

1209
01:34:10,678 --> 01:34:14,180
Both the u. S. And Soviet
response chain on full recall.

1210
01:34:14,215 --> 01:34:16,199
Damn.

1211
01:34:16,234 --> 01:34:18,183
Recalled.

1212
01:34:41,703 --> 01:34:44,707
Place them under arrest-
all of them.

1213
01:34:44,742 --> 01:34:46,708
Wait! We don't know
these men.

1214
01:34:46,743 --> 01:34:48,175
We were kidnapped.

1215
01:34:48,210 --> 01:34:49,676
That's right!
Kidnapped!

1216
01:34:49,711 --> 01:34:52,630
Yes! We were. We were
at the drive-in.

1217
01:34:52,665 --> 01:34:54,544
As the disarmament
talks here

1218
01:34:54,579 --> 01:34:56,424
continue through
closed sessions

1219
01:34:56,925 --> 01:34:58,928
last night and
on into this afternoon,

1220
01:34:58,963 --> 01:35:00,931
a feeling
of positive anticipation

1221
01:35:01,431 --> 01:35:03,432
is shared by everyone
in the press corps.

1222
01:35:03,467 --> 01:35:06,434
The doors
to the conference room

1223
01:35:06,469 --> 01:35:07,901
are opening.

1224
01:35:07,936 --> 01:35:10,437
I see the chief
United States delegate

1225
01:35:10,472 --> 01:35:11,938
Mr. Emmett Fitz-Hume.

1226
01:35:12,939 --> 01:35:13,940
Mr. Fitz-Hume.

1227
01:35:13,975 --> 01:35:15,405
Hi, ed.

1228
01:35:15,440 --> 01:35:18,443
Everybody at home is
most anxious to know

1229
01:35:18,478 --> 01:35:20,447
how things are going
in there.

1230
01:35:20,482 --> 01:35:21,413
Well, Ed, right now

1231
01:35:21,448 --> 01:35:23,449
we're at an extremely
sensitive juncture.

1232
01:35:23,484 --> 01:35:25,450
And, of course,
the slightest misperceived

1233
01:35:25,485 --> 01:35:26,416
phrase or gesture

1234
01:35:26,451 --> 01:35:29,453
could upset everything
we've achieved today.

1235
01:35:29,488 --> 01:35:31,455
Now if you'll
excuse me, ed...

1236
01:35:31,490 --> 01:35:32,956
thank you,
Mr. Fitz-Hume.

1237
01:35:33,456 --> 01:35:33,957
Thank you, Ed.

1238
01:35:34,457 --> 01:35:35,422
Mr. Emmett Fitz-Hume,

1239
01:35:35,457 --> 01:35:37,209
chief state department
negotiator

1240
01:35:37,244 --> 01:35:38,962
here at
the disarmament talks

1241
01:35:39,462 --> 01:35:40,463
re-entering
what he has called

1242
01:35:40,964 --> 01:35:43,466
"the delicately
balanced negotiations."

1243
01:35:46,468 --> 01:35:48,469
Comrade!

1244
01:35:51,471 --> 01:35:52,973
Ok.

1245
01:35:53,473 --> 01:35:55,474
"What little Richard song

1246
01:35:55,978 --> 01:35:59,480
"was the title
of a 1950s movie

1247
01:35:59,515 --> 01:36:02,983
starring Jayne Mansfield?"

1248
01:36:10,489 --> 01:36:12,991
Good golly,
miss molly?

1249
01:36:14,994 --> 01:36:16,460
Great balls of fire?

1250
01:36:16,495 --> 01:36:19,497
Wrong! It was
the girl can't help it.

1251
01:36:20,498 --> 01:36:21,749
Sorry. You lose.

1252
01:36:21,784 --> 01:36:24,501
Eastern Europe.
