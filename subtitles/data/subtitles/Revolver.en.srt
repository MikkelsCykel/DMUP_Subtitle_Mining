00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,956
One thing I've learned in the last seven years,

2
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,358
in every game and con there is always
an opponent and there is always a victim.

3
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:31,798
The trick is to know when you're the latter,
so you can become the former.

4
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,634
How deep did you bury that shareholder, Paul?

5
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,631
Deep.

6
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,515
Are you sure this is a good idea?

7
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,471
He has to pay us something, doesn't he?

8
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,432
But you've got more money
than you could ever spend.

9
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,630
That's all you think about nowadays.

10
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,671
He owes me and he owes you.

11
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,711
Now he has to pay.

12
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,751
It's cause and effect.

13
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,749
Sorry, sir, this table is closed.

14
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,319
Send him up.

15
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,875
I'm not sure that's a good idea, Mr. D.
He's got better. I mean, a lot better.

16
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,319
All the tables are closed.

17
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,751
Send him up, Paul.

18
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,038
20.

19
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,071
Hold on.

20
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,156
I think we'll take the stairs, eh, Billy?

21
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,077
You want to walk 20 flights, Jake?

22
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,473
Don't be silly.

23
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,592
I don't like to feel trapped. Never did, never will.

24
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,792
Why should a man
do what he doesn't like to do?

25
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,958
Jake, if you want to take the stairs,
we'll take the stairs...

26
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,117
There's always a choice.
What's wrong with the stairs?

27
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,153
Come on, you'll be all right.

28
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,040
I've got to spend the next two minutes

29
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:29,870
shaking and sweating like a crack whore
clucking for a fix.

30
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:37,234
Should have taken the stairs,
cos it's getting very, very tight in here.

31
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,519
I'm afraid it's only two at the table, Mr. Green.

32
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,951
Freddy, you're done.

33
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,357
Have a seat, Mr. Green.

34
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,268
I hear you've done very well for yourself...

35
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,077
...and against all the odds.

36
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,715
They do say, the harder the battle
the sweeter the victory.

37
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,636
A wise man once told me
there's only one rule in this world,

38
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,989
a small question that drives all success.

39
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:33,593
The more a man invests in that question,
the more powerful that man will become.

40
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,314
Can you guess what that question is, Mr. Green?

41
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,717
What's in it for me?

42
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,239
I've been warned
if I let you sit down at this table I might regret it.

43
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,437
They say you've become
very ambitious in your maturing,

44
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,631
and you now wish to acquire yourself
a business,

45
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,875
a business like my business?

46
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,309
But we both know what you are, don't we, Jake?

47
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,876
You're a man who needs a master.
You're an employee.

48
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,911
So, what's in it for me?

49
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:14,754
The pleasure of doing an old employee a favor,

50
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,351
by reminding him of the position
nature chose for him.

51
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,789
Rade, how much have you got?

52
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,637
What's that got to do with you?

53
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,069
Toss you for it.

54
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,989
He's got you there, Rade.

55
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,592
It's not worth a heart attack. Get on with it.

56
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,148
I'll toss you for a tenth.

57
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,875
You're a risk-taker of the highest caliber,
ain't you, Rade?

58
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,791
I'll take red.

59
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,120
Very impressive, Mr. Green.
You've honed those talents most skillfully.

60
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,754
Pay the man his money, Billy.

61
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,631
Should have bet the whole lot, Rade.

62
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,189
You have to teach me that trick sometime.

63
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,911
You're on.

64
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,993
I'll toss you for everything under your chin.

65
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,828
There isn't a problem is there, Mr. D?

66
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,236
You've got a big mouth on a small head,
sunshine.

67
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,077
Be my guest.

68
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,832
I'll take purple.

69
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,871
You're on.

70
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,676
It's a lovely color, purple,

71
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:50,669
discretely sandwiched within
the color spectrum between blue and white.

72
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,435
Always a royal winner.

73
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,955
Billy, do the honors.

74
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,508
Don't you fucking move.

75
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,155
Don't let your mouth put you in more trouble
than your body could handle.

76
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,795
I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll exercise a bit of charity.

77
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,035
Double or quits?

78
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,836
You're on.

79
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,789
Come on.

80
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,752
Mr. Green, Mr. Macha would appreciate it
if you came back to the table.

81
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,231
I haven't finished with him yet.

82
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,071
Now would be a good time.

83
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,755
I think it's time to fly, don't you, Jake?

84
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,151
- Excuse me.
- We're coming through here.

85
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,715
Relax. You're in trouble, Mr. Green.
We could help.

86
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,751
Thank you.

87
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,193
I take the stairs.

88
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,031
He got lucky, Mr. D, that's all.

89
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,071
Fuck luck, the man's a danger.

90
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,430
Since he's been out, he's made a fortune, Mr. D.
He's fat and comfortable.

91
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,870
He's got what he wanted.
I'm sure we won't be hearing from him again.

92
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,196
He ate seven years, Paul.
Seven years doesn't taste nice.

93
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,232
Not to mention the accident
with his brother's wife.

94
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:45,393
And what the fuck does
"I haven't finished with him yet" mean?

95
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,671
Get rid of him.

96
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,671
And I don't want any mistakes.

97
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,110
No crackheads with sharp sticks
acting like silly fucking gangsters.

98
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:03,358
You take Sorter and Slim Biggins.
You do it quickly, you do it quietly.

99
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,228
We don't know what caused the blackout.

100
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:10,956
But we've run some blood tests
and we'll have the results within a few hours.

101
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:15,077
It's a miracle
you didn't sustain any damage from your fall.

102
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,519
Can I go now?

103
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,630
Once you've put your clothes back on.

104
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,750
We'll call you back with the results.

105
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,035
All right, look, I'll take your man back.

106
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,071
Billy. You go home.

107
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,111
It's late.

108
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,271
Go easy now, yeah?

109
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,430
Joe.

110
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,230
Joe.

111
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,475
Jake. Move.
- Joe.

112
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,158
Move. Get the hell out of here.

113
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,117
Al, drive the fucking car.

114
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,674
Sit down and hold on.

115
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,993
Get in the car.

116
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,033
If I wanted you dead,
I would have shot you already.

117
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,599
Sit back and be quiet.

118
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,071
What?

119
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,917
He missed?

120
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,040
Sorter never fucking misses.

121
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,753
I don't know what happened.

122
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,995
Something went wrong.

123
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,031
I had him in my sights...

124
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,593
three times.

125
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,910
You never miss, let alone three times.

126
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,235
Somebody told him we was coming.

127
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,955
Something is very wrong here.

128
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,116
Yeah, something's fucking wrong all right.

129
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,951
Don't make me angry, Slim.

130
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:47,238
I might have missed him,
but I ain't going to miss you, not at this range.

131
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,031
Maybe it's better you just drive.

132
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,711
Doreen, Mr. Green. Mr. Green, Doreen.

133
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,671
Good morning, Mr. Green.

134
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,831
Avi, Mr. Green.

135
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,917
Mr. Green, Avi.

136
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,837
Sit down.

137
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,631
I gather you're quite the player?

138
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,319
I'm a bit of an enthusiast myself.
I thought maybe we could have a few games.

139
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,636
I think you should tell me what is going on,
don't you?

140
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,553
We have your medical results from the hospital.

141
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,353
It's not important how we got them.

142
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:42,439
What is important, however,
is what it has to say.

143
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,029
You will die within three days
from a very unpleasant ailment

144
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,389
that contaminates your blood and organs.

145
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,155
Thanks, fellas.
I'll get back to you on this one, yeah?

146
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,717
Mr. Green.

147
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,672
30 seconds, and you can be on your way.

148
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,598
The longer you listen, the sweeter the pitch.

149
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,471
30 seconds?

150
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,473
We've already saved your life once.
The next time will not be for free.

151
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,234
We shall assist you under two conditions.

152
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,840
These conditions are not negotiable.

153
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,678
Oh, I'm being grafted.

154
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,073
Condition one.

155
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,671
We will bleed you dry.

156
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:49,156
You have to put on a better shirt
before you bleed me dry, my friend.

157
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,795
You will give us every penny you have got.

158
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,115
This is a con.

159
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:58,596
It's only natural that you think that
you are somehow being conned,

160
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:02,269
but think a little harder,
and you will realize that this is not a trick.

161
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,118
Now, condition two.

162
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,994
You will do as we tell you without argument.

163
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:15,398
This includes
answering any questions that are asked.

164
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,878
You don't have a lot of time,
and, in reality, you don't have a choice.

165
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:26,639
Now, the most sensible thing to do
would be to get a second opinion.

166
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,671
Macha has unleashed his legions.

167
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,951
We can protect you from the dangers you face.
That is our deal.

168
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:39,635
You have three hours to decide.
After that, you will be beyond our help.

169
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,558
Think I'm going to part with
my hard-earned cash

170
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,830
for a set of home-made hospital results?

171
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,871
I don't think so.

172
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,797
Not today.

173
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:05,755
I don't have good news, I'm afraid, Mr. Green.

174
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:09,713
They've thought this one through all right.
Oh, they're smart.

175
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,991
Smart as a pair of a little boy's shoes.

176
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,031
She has to be in on it.

177
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,071
That's how they got the results.

178
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,998
Got to find someone they couldn't have got to.

179
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,315
Well, Jake...

180
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,271
I'm sorry, there's...

181
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,311
there's no easy way to tell you this.

182
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:37,796
You have a rare blood disease.

183
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,071
How did they get to him?

184
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,877
He's in on it.

185
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,199
After a few days I think...

186
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:53,158
- How much did they pay you?
- What? Who?

187
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,235
How much?

188
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,999
What are you talking about?
I have no idea what you mean.

189
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,793
You've got five seconds. Five...

190
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,274
I have no idea what you're talking about.

191
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,072
- Four...
- Wh? I...

192
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,429
- Three... Two...
- I don't know what you mean.

193
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,118
God. No, no.

194
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:12,835
When you're winning,
who thinks about losing?

195
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,668
But when you're faced with what I'm looking at,

196
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,349
a new and cold reality dawns.

197
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:25,229
A fact we like to ignore.

198
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,840
You can not win.

199
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,634
The only prize they guarantee
when you play this game

200
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,671
is that you will lose.

201
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,274
It's only a question of when.

202
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:43,511
I made a mistake.

203
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:48,350
You never miss,
so why now and why three times?

204
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,635
I had a bad feeling.

205
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,556
"Feeling?"

206
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:03,759
I'm not sure if I paid you to have feelings,
now, did I, Sorter?

207
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,032
I paid you
because you're the best in the business.

208
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:13,676
Why would you let feelings
confuse that relationship?

209
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,631
Listen to me.

210
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:20,797
Urgency has become something of an issue.

211
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:24,230
So if you could restrain those feelings

212
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:30,150
until you've completed the mission,
I would be most grateful.

213
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,950
Do you think you could do that for me?

214
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,877
Sure.

215
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,911
I'd appreciate it.

216
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:58,914
If there is one thing I have learnt
about experts, they're experts on fuck all.

217
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:04,750
If there's a rule, you can bend it.
If there's a law, it can be broken.

218
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:13,519
From now on, I am breaking all the rules,
because desperate men do desperate deeds.

219
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,474
Cash just seems to remain king, doesn't it?

220
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,514
New bills. Not too many of them in this town.

221
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,157
I love a new bill.

222
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,510
Represents so much hope.
Look how clean and stiff it is.

223
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,630
It even smells proud.

224
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:44,992
Your work starts now. You'll be driving.

225
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:55,157
We are, and I apologize for the
unnecessarily dramatic moniker, loan sharks.

226
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,910
People hate and fear us,
just like you will learn to hate and fear us.

227
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,076
We know how much you love a dollar bill,

228
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:06,238
and it won't be easy watching them
fall through your hands,

229
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:09,272
because it will be your money
that we will be loaning.

230
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,311
Don't say a word.

231
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:25,272
Just hold the bag
and if we nod, leave it on the table.

232
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,351
There's nothing left.

233
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,433
That's a very sad story, Mr. Horowitz.
My sympathies are with you and your colleague.

234
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:37,712
Maybe I am being conned,
maybe I am being fooled.

235
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,958
Excuse us for having to know
the reason for your loan,

236
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,719
but we have to assess our clients very carefully.

237
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:49,436
They say the sentence has been passed,
the certificate signed, so what's the point?

238
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,677
The point is, this is the only option.

239
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,513
If you snap those fingers at me again,
I'll fucking break 'em.

240
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,836
You know our rates, right?

241
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,953
And our policies?

242
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,992
No offence, gentlemen,
but you have a reputation.

243
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,554
I wouldn't be speaking to you if I had a choice.

244
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:31,119
It's a strange thing,
but I still don't like to give it away.

245
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:38,078
I know I can't take it with me, so why the pain?

246
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,594
Why the fuck does it still hurt?

247
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:54,432
And greasing the sheaths of these two pricks
isn't making it any easier.

248
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,230
We need to know your history with Macha.

249
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,396
How much of it?

250
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,874
All of it.

251
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,029
Macha had these three clowns working for him
called the three Eddies.

252
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,116
Flash, loud, proud and stupid.

253
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:30,199
They were looking after these shitty little games
going on all over the city.

254
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,199
They were wild and dangerous,
but if you won they paid well.

255
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,755
Macha had lost his card man
just before a big game.

256
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:42,316
Anyway they knew I could play,
so they wanted me to take his place.

257
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:45,511
Like any man who was thinking, I refused.

258
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:48,358
So they started to lean on
my brother and his family.

259
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,755
He'd just had a little girl at the time and...

260
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,990
...the whole situation was getting messy.

261
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:57,191
# How many legs has daddy long-legs got?

262
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,755
So, for the sake of keeping the peace,
I rolled over and agreed to play.

263
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,836
I won, and I was done.

264
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,871
That's very good, Mr. Green,

265
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:09,277
but tell me, does your mum...
from a donkey?

266
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,117
Then some cowboy starts mouthing off.

267
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,071
I wasn't having any of that shit.

268
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,031
I'm not having any of that shit.

269
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,111
I've got a funny one for you too, George.

270
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:25,550
Very funny, George.
This one will make you laugh.

271
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:32,111
Next thing you know, it's a gunfight,
people get hurt and money disappears.

272
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:35,869
Two weeks later, someone drops my name
and I'm being questioned.

273
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:40,357
The Eddies thought I might talk,
so they threatened my brother's daughter.

274
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,029
The mother reacted badly, like they do
when their little ones are in danger.

275
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,231
They got into a fight
and she took an angry stray bullet.

276
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:51,034
My brother lost his wife
and his daughter lost her mother.

277
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,157
I lost my sense of humor and seven years

278
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,749
because I wouldn't tell the authorities
that Macha had organized the games.

279
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,472
Sometime after that,
the Eddies upset Macha in some way,

280
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:08,514
so he had them used as aggregate and mixed
into some concrete on one of his buildings.

281
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,437
Macha had to pay something, didn't he?

282
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:20,159
And I know nothing hurts more than humiliation
and a little money loss.

283
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,511
I employ hundreds of people.

284
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,551
They have to be paid tomorrow.

285
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,989
We need three more days.

286
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,758
Try to understand.

287
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,511
What did I sign up for?

288
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:48,430
Don't try to make sense out of it, not now,
cos it doesn't make sense.

289
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:53,350
I just know if you start a job then finish it.

290
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,549
I promise.

291
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,591
Yes, you will.

292
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,790
Goddamn right.

293
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:06,231
Their idea of discretion is to choose a motel

294
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:09,033
whose only clients are blood,
come and afro sheen.

295
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:11,071
Make yourself at home.

296
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,111
You'll be hearing from us.

297
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,353
We can't see Gold.

298
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,960
What are you talking about?
I've been here for an hour.

299
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,150
I'm not the one
who asked for a fucking meeting.

300
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,715
Apparently, no-one sees Gold.
We've got one of his representatives, Walker.

301
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,479
- Lilly Walker?
- That's right.

302
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,155
Mr. Macha, I don't think we've met.

303
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,191
I'm Miss Walker.

304
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,515
I work for Mr. Gold. Do you mind if we walk?

305
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,910
I understand you have been commissioned
to do some work for us?

306
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,952
I thought it might be a good idea
if we had a little chat

307
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,391
to make sure you understand the gravity
of the endeavor you have undertaken.

308
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,829
Yeah, I do, I understand.

309
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:23,793
Everything's set. The date hasn't changed,
you'll get the powder by Friday.

310
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:28,550
Good. Mr. Gold has put his faith in you,
and he has people to please.

311
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,273
We've heard
you might be having some problems?

312
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,311
No, no.

313
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,749
We don't like publicity, Mr. Macha.

314
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:39,270
No, neither do I.
I won't let you down, I won't let Mr. Gold down.

315
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,635
So, we're clear?

316
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,189
Mr. Gold doesn't give more time

317
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:16,038
or second chances.

318
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:22,838
As you can appreciate, there is no shortage
of people who wish to do business with Mr. Gold.

319
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,393
Good day.

320
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,078
Here's your money.

321
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,838
What now?

322
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,791
Have a seat.

323
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,430
We need to know how much time you did,
and who you did it with.

324
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,072
Why?

325
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,792
"Why?"

326
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,592
The deal is we ask the questions.

327
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,271
I had two choices inside,

328
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:44,835
14 years' normal time or seven years' solitary.

329
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,992
I chose the solitary.

330
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,313
I spent 20 hours a day locked up
in between two salty convicts

331
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:03,830
who had been down there for more years
than they cared to remember.

332
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:07,031
One was a chess master,
the other a master conman.

333
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,071
They had never seen or spoken to each other,

334
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,715
but they might as well have been married,
they knew so much about one another.

335
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,239
Once a day, the library on wheels

336
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:17,078
would be pushed around
by a pair of axe-murdering twins,

337
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,395
that had pushed the trolley for 22 years.

338
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:26,230
My neighbors used to write down chess moves
and concepts of the con

339
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:29,397
in the back pages of books
based on subjects like...

340
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:37,039
Theoretical Astrophysics Part Four,
The Mathematics Of Quantum Mechanics.

341
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:39,275
They just used them for the con.

342
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:43,598
I used to intercept the books, because
I was sandwiched in between their cells.

343
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:48,191
It's a dangerous combination, chess and cons.

344
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,596
These boys were locked up on their own
for ten years with no distractions.

345
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:55,633
Nothing to do but think about
how to steal one another's pieces.

346
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,716
Yeah, they thought.

347
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,879
They really thought.

348
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:05,549
I was under the impression that I was
the clever bastard before I went in.

349
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:10,196
But these boys were a completely different
class. Head tricksters of the premier division.

350
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,233
Their sole ambition was to create
the ultimate con and win the ultimate game,

351
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:17,113
always thinking quicker, always thinking bigger.

352
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:21,597
Gradually, they thought
they'd found a formula to the con. Check.

353
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:25,394
A formula to win the ultimate win, the formula.

354
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,396
I couldn't understand the depth of it,

355
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,557
but they were confident it was real
and I believed them.

356
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,999
After all, they'd been right on everything else,

357
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:38,271
so now they felt they'd had their moment

358
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,630
and it was time for them
to leave the confines of their cell.

359
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:44,672
The concrete and steel wasn't even mentioned.

360
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,837
I didn't even doubt them.
They got whatever they wanted anyway.

361
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:51,589
I could smell their food
through 12 inches of concrete.

362
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,995
Bastards knew it used to drive me mad.

363
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,190
You bastards.

364
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:00,438
We were all going to go together,
they swore to me. "You're coming with us, Jake."

365
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,075
And I trusted them.
Never for a second did I doubt them.

366
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,509
Next day, they were gone without a trace.

367
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:09,154
For the next week,
the authorities tore the place apart.

368
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:14,194
Couldn't find evidence of their existence,
let alone their exit. They just evaporated.

369
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,798
Check.

370
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,956
Two years later, I was out.

371
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,195
But those two knew everything about me.

372
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:31,033
Everything. All my dirty little secrets,
how much money I had, where I kept it.

373
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,230
The hustling bastards cleaned me out.

374
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:37,068
They didn't leave so much
as a pair of socks, only a note.

375
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:41,193
Rule one: You can only get smarter
by playing a smarter opponent.

376
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:47,114
But I had their formula and

377
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,549
it worked.

378
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,591
It really worked.

379
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,950
Not doing you much good now, is it?

380
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,071
Checkmate.

381
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:04,396
He needs to get moving.
Give him the addresses.

382
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,831
Why are they dragging this on?

383
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,111
They could just clean me out in one hit.

384
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,071
They want me to suffer.

385
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:36,156
These twisted bastards are making me pay.
Pay for my own pain.

386
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:41,079
Hands down, that's the most radical concept
I have ever heard of...

387
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,680
...and a part of me dies every time I think about it.

388
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:52,314
I told myself if this is my last round,
they'll have to tear me out, piece by piece,

389
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,874
but this I can't take.

390
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,717
They've found a weakness.

391
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:01,718
Caught me fair and square, cross-haired,

392
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:06,390
blind-folded, one foot in the grave
and two hands on the coffin.

393
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:12,117
I'm cooked, well done,
stick a fork in me and see if I bleed.

394
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:17,956
- Checkmate.
- You're quite good at this game, Mr. Green.

395
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:23,229
I am stuck in a trance...

396
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:28,319
...somewhere between hell and a hard place...

397
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,828
...in a gear that doesn't exist,

398
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,831
and all I want now...

399
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,871
...is a little peace.

400
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,071
Where are you?

401
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:46,588
- At the old lady's house.
- Does she have it?

402
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:49,837
Of course she doesn't have it.
She's barely got a heartbeat.

403
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,633
How the hell is this woman
going to get that kind of money?

404
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:55,114
That's what she owes. Any furniture?

405
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,912
No.

406
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,349
Take the dog.

407
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,868
I am not taking the dog.

408
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,593
- Then take the TV.
- The TV don't work.

409
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,198
Then get your ass over here.

410
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,151
How do you sleep at night?

411
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,191
How are we doing?

412
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,912
Ask the man.

413
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,951
No thanks, darling.

414
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,150
Time's up, lets go.

415
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,871
Mr. Green, you took your time.

416
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,394
- Did you get anything from the old lady?
- No.

417
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,431
Did you get anything from Horowitz?

418
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,471
- No.
- Why not?

419
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,511
Because he didn't have it.

420
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:56,358
Listen, pal, either he pays or you pay.

421
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,391
I pay anyway.

422
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,431
Don't be a smartass.

423
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:05,714
Look, man,
we are not sending you out to polish door knobs.

424
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,751
You've got to get with it, man.

425
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,871
Doreen, take his car.

426
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,354
Come with us.

427
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,391
What is this?

428
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,431
Where was security?

429
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,675
They gassed them. We found them tied up.

430
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,755
Hold tight, Mr. Green.

431
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:35,875
It was a 12-ton Hermann and Ziegler safe, Mr. D.
It was impossible to break into.

432
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,592
Time's up, let's go.

433
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:41,474
Obviously, it wasn't fucking impossible
to move, was it, Paul?

434
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,751
What did anyone take it for?

435
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,314
We don't even use that safe, do we, Paul?

436
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,396
Checkmate.

437
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,958
How in the hell did you do that?

438
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,991
Not usually, no.

439
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,754
Sam Gold's powder was in there.
It came in yesterday.

440
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:15,232
No, Paul, you're wrong.

441
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,348
Try again.

442
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,351
You stupid motherfucker.

443
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,876
That should rattle him.

444
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,388
What the fuck was it doing
on one of our properties?

445
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,715
Why don't you just fucking rape me, Paul?

446
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,071
Pull the troops together.

447
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,634
Break some bones, hurt some people, results.

448
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,671
- You hear me?
- I'll take care of it.

449
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,632
You're damn straight
you're going to fucking take care of it.

450
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,592
The word "excuse" does not exist
in Sam Gold's lexicon.

451
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,916
We are the walking dead
until you fucking remedy this situation.

452
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:00,155
- Do you understand?
- I'll take care of it.

453
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:03,988
I said, do you understand?

454
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:06,031
- Yes.
- You'd better.

455
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:09,196
In the meantime, get some more powder.

456
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:12,835
I don't care where it comes from
or how much it costs, just get it.

457
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,555
There's only one man who can get us
that amount on such short notice.

458
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,397
Who?

459
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,317
Lord John.

460
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,112
No way. I'm not nourishing the competition.

461
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,515
That's twice the market price.

462
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,753
Sorry, we can't help, Mr. Paul.

463
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,791
Tony'll show you the way out.

464
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:59,072
All right. Hold on, hold on.

465
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,516
I am prepared to talk.

466
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,955
What do you want to talk about?

467
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,711
OK, get it.

468
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,751
What?

469
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,791
Am I having déjà-vu, Paul?

470
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,831
Didn't I just say "get it"?

471
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,792
This is Sam Gold
I have found myself chained to.

472
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,831
Mr. Black Magic.

473
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,871
Mr. "l-run-this-game" Gold.

474
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,708
Not some plastic gangster
with a pocketknife for backup.

475
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:58,629
Gold doesn't give second chances, Paul.
I want in and I want rewards.

476
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,311
Got it?

477
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:12,111
Paul,

478
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:17,678
when you make the deal, keep both eyes
on that untrustworthy, greedy motherfucker.

479
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:17,468
If anyone asks, you don't speak the language.

480
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,198
After you, Mr. Green.

481
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,276
I'm taking the stairs.

482
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,878
What's the problem, Mr. Green?

483
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:34,549
- I don't like elevators.
- What are you scared of?

484
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:37,637
Are you fucking deaf?
I said I just don't like them.

485
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,875
Tough, because you're getting in.

486
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,755
Everything?

487
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,672
If he wants a fucking war,
I'm going to give him a fucking war.

488
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:02,269
I don't think it was Lord John, Mr. D.
He knows you'd come looking for him.

489
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:05,915
He's not far from wrong. Because
that is exactly what I'm going to fucking do.

490
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,511
I'll take the stairs.

491
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:17,315
Before we do anything, Mr. D,
we have to get Sam Gold his powder.

492
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:19,794
- Don't pull the trigger...
- Shut your fucking mouth.

493
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,558
- I'll get out.
- You ain't going nowhere.

494
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,751
I said you're staying right here.

495
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:30,759
Get rid of the Lord...
there will be consequences.

496
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,155
Do I look like I'm afraid of the consequences?

497
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:40,040
- I'm taking the stairs.
- You ain't going nowhere.

498
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,559
You motherfucking listen.

499
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,797
Look at me. You think I'm afraid
of the fucking consequences?

500
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,512
- Take the stairs.
- You listen to me.

501
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:52,275
You open your mouth one more fucking time,
I'll blow your fucking head off.

502
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,072
Fuck him.

503
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,473
Fuck the consequences.

504
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:00,031
Fuck them all.

505
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,957
- Do I look like I'm afraid?
- No.

506
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,991
Do you understand me? Do you?

507
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:14,236
Lou, what's going on?

508
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:15,554
We're here.

509
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:18,589
How many?

510
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,318
We're doing a deal in the next room.

511
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,234
When do you make the trade?

512
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:29,676
- Ten minutes.
- Ten minutes?

513
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:34,036
- Don't trust those yellow dogs.
- I don't trust anyone.

514
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,957
Lou?

515
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,275
Talk to me, you motherfucker.

516
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:46,276
Or I'll kill you myself.

517
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:02,671
The consequences can kiss my black ass.

518
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,750
This has become a large problem, Avi.

519
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:35,672
There's no such thing as problems, Mr. Green,

520
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:38,473
only situations.

521
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,997
Wake up, Mr. Green.

522
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:10,271
Checkmate.

523
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:15,111
How?

524
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:17,151
How what?

525
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,475
We've kept you alive, now you can tell me.

526
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,397
How do you keep winning?

527
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,431
It's very simple.

528
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:26,950
You do all the hard work, I just help you along.

529
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:32,669
The art is for me to feed pieces to you

530
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:38,078
and make you believe you took those pieces,
because you are smarter and I am dumber.

531
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:43,433
In every game and con there is always
an opponent and there is always a victim.

532
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:46,278
The more control the victim thinks he has,

533
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:49,231
the less control he actually has.

534
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,271
Gradually he will hang himself.

535
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:54,039
I, as the opponent, just help him along.

536
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,877
Is that the treasured formula?

537
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:01,071
The formula has infinite depth
in its efficacy and application,

538
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:04,829
but it is staggeringly simple
and completely consistent.

539
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:10,079
Rule one of any game or con: You can only
get smarter by playing a smarter opponent.

540
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:11,439
Rule number two.

541
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:16,031
The more sophisticated the game,
the more sophisticated the opponent.

542
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:19,310
If the opponent is very good,

543
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:22,909
he will place his victim
inside an environment he can control.

544
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:25,599
The bigger the environment,
the easier the control.

545
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:30,316
Toss the dog a bone, find their weakness,

546
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:33,272
and give them just a little
of what they think they want.

547
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,308
Check.

548
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:40,079
So the opponent simply distracts their victim

549
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:43,237
by getting them consumed
with their own consumption.

550
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:48,998
Check.

551
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:52,554
The word "snake" springs to mind.

552
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:56,388
Don't knock it.
You only get smarter by playing a snake.

553
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:02,317
The bigger the trick and older the trick,
the easier it is to pull.

554
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:05,158
Based on two principles.

555
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:08,431
They think it can't be that old
and they think it can't be that big,

556
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,357
for so many people to have fallen for it.

557
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:17,075
Eventually,
when the opponent is challenged or questioned,

558
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:22,399
it means the victim's investment
and thus his intelligence is questioned.

559
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,431
No-one can accept that,

560
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:27,471
not even to themselves.

561
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,431
Checkmate.

562
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:36,914
I ain't playing you again.

563
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:40,919
You'll always find a good opponent
in the very last place you would ever look.

564
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:45,078
You've got more tricks than a clown's pocket,
don't you, Mr. Green?

565
00:49:58,080 --> 00:49:59,877
Everything all right?

566
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,439
Can they hear you?

567
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:13,550
Two minutes.

568
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,671
You're OK.

569
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:19,711
Get out, Jake, as soon as you can.

570
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:22,320
I had to dig very deep
to find someone who'd talk.

571
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:24,351
They're the last resort.

572
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:30,430
They're the last resort. When no other
loan sharks will lend them, your boys move in.

573
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:34,358
They stepped on Gold's toes
and he wouldn't touch 'em.

574
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:35,879
Gold?

575
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:39,276
Yes, the Gold, Sam Gold.

576
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:41,629
Mr. Clandestine.

577
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,796
Mr. Ambiguous.

578
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:45,796
Mr. Mystery.

579
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:49,753
Get out of there.

580
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:53,357
Get out of there, Jake.

581
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:57,518
No-one lives and displeases Gold.

582
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:59,198
No-one but your two friends.

583
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:02,118
Got to be something wrong with 'em
if Gold won't touch 'em.

584
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:05,232
Got to be something wrong
if the Goldfather won't touch 'em.

585
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:07,396
No-one sees Gold,

586
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,556
but Gold sees everything.

587
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:15,151
The smoke signals say,
"Dodge 'em like an angry bullet."

588
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:18,510
Tell your friend to get out of there.

589
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:20,949
Jake, get out of there.

590
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,274
Get out of there.

591
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:24,595
Get out of there.

592
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:37,430
Tomorrow.

593
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,591
You're worse than a stuck record.

594
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:48,234
"Tomorrow, tomorrow."

595
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:50,236
Tomorrow is never going to come, is it?

596
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:51,679
Hello, it's warming up.

597
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:54,678
Zach, kick him, see if that jogs him on.

598
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,551
You want me to play mother?

599
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:59,160
I took care of Horowitz. It's your turn.

600
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:06,909
Change of plan.

601
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:08,678
I can see what's coming.

602
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,358
Give it to Mr. Green.

603
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:18,794
Mr. Green.

604
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:20,159
Shoot Fred for me.

605
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,998
Not dead, stupid, just in the back of the knee.

606
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:28,270
I ain't shooting Fred, Zach.

607
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:32,552
Sometimes, a little voice
tells you to think about number one.

608
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:34,192
Told you, Avi.

609
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:38,630
Never had the gumption,
never going to have what it takes.

610
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:40,432
It's easier than you think.

611
00:52:40,432 --> 00:52:42,992
It's one little squeeze,

612
00:52:43,032 --> 00:52:45,592
just like a tube of toothpaste.

613
00:52:45,632 --> 00:52:47,463
Who the fuck are you two?

614
00:52:47,512 --> 00:52:49,946
You can't see what's right in front of you.

615
00:52:49,992 --> 00:52:56,750
You're supposed to be stiff, cold and horizontal,
and you still don't trust us?

616
00:52:57,792 --> 00:53:00,989
Shoot him in the kneecap.
The debt has to be paid.

617
00:53:02,032 --> 00:53:05,388
And sometimes it's best to listen to it.

618
00:53:06,592 --> 00:53:08,583
Get your arse up, Fred.

619
00:53:11,072 --> 00:53:12,505
Go on. Get out.

620
00:53:15,312 --> 00:53:17,667
He can't do that, Jake.

621
00:53:17,712 --> 00:53:19,191
Then why don't you stop him, Avi?

622
00:53:19,232 --> 00:53:22,110
What the fuck do you know?
Shoot that toad now.

623
00:53:26,432 --> 00:53:27,990
One more step, Avi.

624
00:53:29,632 --> 00:53:31,463
Just like a squeeze of toothpaste.

625
00:53:33,512 --> 00:53:36,185
You realize what you're doing, Mr. Green?

626
00:53:36,232 --> 00:53:41,704
Hold on, Jake. This isn't the plan.
This won't have a happy ending.

627
00:53:43,152 --> 00:53:44,710
One more step, Avi.

628
00:54:00,232 --> 00:54:02,188
Wake up, Mr. Green.

629
00:54:38,872 --> 00:54:42,751
Congratulations, Mr. Green.
It's past the third day and you have risen.

630
00:54:42,792 --> 00:54:44,783
I think you're due for a check-up.

631
00:54:51,592 --> 00:54:53,389
Did the bad guys get you?

632
00:54:53,432 --> 00:54:55,423
There's no such thing as "bad guys", Rachel.

633
00:54:55,472 --> 00:54:58,430
Yes, there are.
That's why Daddy's friends are looking after us.

634
00:54:58,472 --> 00:55:03,262
Never mind about that. Why don't you be a
good girl and get your Uncle Jake a cold drink?

635
00:55:13,432 --> 00:55:15,423
It's a bit of a mess, isn't it?

636
00:55:15,472 --> 00:55:17,508
Things will sort themselves out.

637
00:55:17,552 --> 00:55:19,543
Is she all right?

638
00:55:19,592 --> 00:55:22,743
Don't you worry about her.
You just look after yourself.

639
00:55:26,312 --> 00:55:28,985
Mr. Green, I don't know how to tell you this.

640
00:55:29,032 --> 00:55:32,741
Our first results,
they must have been wrong.

641
00:55:37,312 --> 00:55:39,621
I cannot apologize enough for this error.

642
00:55:39,672 --> 00:55:43,267
You're not a well man, but...

643
00:56:03,192 --> 00:56:05,308
We have to assess our clients very carefully.

644
00:56:13,072 --> 00:56:17,509
There is something about yourself
that you don't know.

645
00:56:17,552 --> 00:56:21,511
Something that you will deny even exists

646
00:56:21,552 --> 00:56:25,704
until it's too late to do anything about it.

647
00:56:31,112 --> 00:56:34,821
It's the only reason you get up in the morning,

648
00:56:34,872 --> 00:56:38,262
the only reason you suffer the shitty boss,

649
00:56:38,312 --> 00:56:41,031
the blood, the sweat and the tears.

650
00:56:42,072 --> 00:56:44,347
This is because you want people to know

651
00:56:44,392 --> 00:56:50,342
how good, attractive, generous, funny,
wild and clever you really are.

652
00:56:50,392 --> 00:56:54,590
"Fear or revere me,
but please think I'm special."

653
00:56:55,632 --> 00:56:57,907
We share an addiction.

654
00:56:57,952 --> 00:57:00,102
We're approval junkies.

655
00:57:00,992 --> 00:57:03,347
We're all in it for the slap on the back

656
00:57:03,392 --> 00:57:05,383
and the gold watch.

657
00:57:05,432 --> 00:57:08,424
The "hip, hip, hoo-fucking-rah."

658
00:57:08,472 --> 00:57:12,704
Look at the clever boy
with the badge, polishing his trophy.

659
00:57:12,752 --> 00:57:16,108
Shine on, you crazy diamond.

660
00:57:16,152 --> 00:57:19,940
Cos we're just monkeys wrapped in suits,

661
00:57:19,992 --> 00:57:23,667
begging for the approval of others.

662
00:57:25,752 --> 00:57:28,710
If we knew this, we wouldn't do this.

663
00:57:28,752 --> 00:57:31,186
Someone is hiding it from us.

664
00:57:32,232 --> 00:57:36,271
And if you had a second chance,
you would ask...

665
00:57:36,312 --> 00:57:37,506
Why?

666
00:57:37,552 --> 00:57:39,543
- Why what?
- Why am I still alive?

667
00:57:39,592 --> 00:57:42,186
Why did you give my money away?

668
00:57:42,232 --> 00:57:44,223
Why didn't you want 'em to know?

669
00:57:45,432 --> 00:57:47,662
Why didn't you want me to know?

670
00:57:47,712 --> 00:57:49,623
You'll find out soon enough.

671
00:57:53,072 --> 00:57:55,063
Whilst I've been digging around on Lord John

672
00:57:55,112 --> 00:57:58,104
I came across a couple
of cash-talking shit-sniffers

673
00:57:58,152 --> 00:57:59,744
who came up with the name...

674
00:57:59,792 --> 00:58:01,384
Green.

675
00:58:01,432 --> 00:58:03,388
That's right, Jake Green.

676
00:58:03,432 --> 00:58:05,946
- Go on.
- I'm working for his brother.

677
00:58:05,992 --> 00:58:06,902
Patrick.

678
00:58:06,952 --> 00:58:11,662
A couple of opportunists, looking after
his older brother, got a little bit greedy.

679
00:58:11,712 --> 00:58:12,986
Want to impress you.

680
00:58:13,032 --> 00:58:17,548
All right, you take Sorter and Slim Biggins
and enough men to avoid an excuse.

681
00:58:20,952 --> 00:58:23,341
It's about fucking time.

682
00:58:26,232 --> 00:58:28,541
Now that is a picture.

683
00:58:29,592 --> 00:58:32,425
You took your sweet-ass time.
I was starting to get bored.

684
00:58:32,472 --> 00:58:34,508
You should have kept busy with a swim.

685
00:58:34,552 --> 00:58:38,261
Funny you should say that.
Zach's quite a swimmer, aren't you, Zach?

686
00:58:38,312 --> 00:58:40,428
20 lengths in ten seconds.

687
00:58:40,472 --> 00:58:45,341
We thought it might be a record. You want
to try to beat it? Come on in and join us.

688
00:58:45,392 --> 00:58:49,146
I'll just pop upstairs, grab my trunks,
and be down in a jiffy.

689
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:52,309
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
- Oh, and why is that, Avi?

690
00:58:52,352 --> 00:58:54,263
Why do you think we're in this icy birdbath,

691
00:58:54,312 --> 00:58:57,588
when we could be upstairs, toasty
and cozy, watching the naughty channel?

692
00:59:00,112 --> 00:59:04,025
How long can it take to get five coffees
and a couple of pizzas?

693
00:59:09,672 --> 00:59:11,981
You are on your own, Jakey boy.

694
00:59:16,912 --> 00:59:18,391
Move.

695
01:00:00,032 --> 01:00:02,068
You've got to tell the boss.

696
01:00:02,112 --> 01:00:04,103
Why me?

697
01:00:04,152 --> 01:00:06,382
Because you're the one who ordered the pizza.

698
01:00:19,192 --> 01:00:21,911
This time you're going to tell me what's going on.

699
01:00:21,952 --> 01:00:23,943
Two sugars, am I right?

700
01:00:23,992 --> 01:00:25,630
Forget the tea, Avi.

701
01:00:26,672 --> 01:00:28,663
Thank you, Jenny, that will be all.

702
01:00:31,392 --> 01:00:35,431
You didn't tell us the truth
about the three Eddies did you, Mr. Green?

703
01:00:35,472 --> 01:00:37,508
The Eddies upset Macha in some way

704
01:00:37,552 --> 01:00:41,625
so he had them used as aggregate, and mixed
into some concrete on one of his buildings.

705
01:00:46,312 --> 01:00:49,429
Would you like us to remind you
of what really happened?

706
01:00:50,872 --> 01:00:54,262
The Eddies were waiting for you
when you got out of prison.

707
01:00:54,312 --> 01:00:56,268
It was Macha's fault.

708
01:00:56,312 --> 01:00:58,621
They didn't work for him any more,
and wanted to...

709
01:00:58,672 --> 01:00:59,787
...compensate you.

710
01:00:59,832 --> 01:01:01,788
What they really meant was they wanted...

711
01:01:01,832 --> 01:01:05,711
...to put 12 grams of angry lead
in the back of your fucking head.

712
01:01:05,752 --> 01:01:08,505
But you gave them an offer they couldn't refuse.

713
01:01:08,552 --> 01:01:10,668
No-one kills a man
who's going to make 'em money.

714
01:01:10,712 --> 01:01:14,625
So you would give them 3% a month
on any money they would lend you.

715
01:01:14,672 --> 01:01:19,348
You needed the money quickly for some small
but profitable deal that you'd made on the inside.

716
01:01:19,392 --> 01:01:24,227
In fact, it was more profitable than any rate
they can get anywhere, legal or illegal.

717
01:01:24,272 --> 01:01:26,342
- So, one of them said...
- I'm in.

718
01:01:26,392 --> 01:01:29,907
- A month later he got his money back.
- Plus your 3%.

719
01:01:30,952 --> 01:01:34,262
- Now, nobody kills a man...
...who's going to make him money.

720
01:01:34,312 --> 01:01:37,190
- They always protect their investment.
- I can give you 4% a month.

721
01:01:37,232 --> 01:01:40,030
- You know this is just between us?
- That's right, Eddie.

722
01:01:40,072 --> 01:01:42,506
Next deal - this time they're all in.

723
01:01:42,552 --> 01:01:44,543
I give you 4% a month.

724
01:01:45,632 --> 01:01:49,591
For two years you always came through,
regular like clockwork.

725
01:01:49,632 --> 01:01:51,350
But there was no deal.

726
01:01:51,392 --> 01:01:55,544
You would take money off of one Eddie
and repay the other Eddie, plus the 4%.

727
01:01:55,592 --> 01:01:57,662
Plus your 4%. On top.

728
01:01:57,712 --> 01:02:01,591
You were not greedy, you did it nice and slow.

729
01:02:01,632 --> 01:02:03,304
You were paying for their trust.

730
01:02:03,352 --> 01:02:06,424
- This is just between us, right, Jake?
- That's right, Eddie.

731
01:02:06,472 --> 01:02:10,624
It was the easiest money they'd known. Soon
they couldn't give you their money fast enough.

732
01:02:10,672 --> 01:02:13,391
A few months later they didn't
have enough of their own to lend,

733
01:02:13,432 --> 01:02:15,627
so they started to borrow money off Macha.

734
01:02:15,672 --> 01:02:17,344
- 3%?
- Plus your 3%.

735
01:02:17,392 --> 01:02:19,667
- 4%?
- Plus your 4%.

736
01:02:20,912 --> 01:02:22,630
5%?

737
01:02:22,672 --> 01:02:24,185
Macha became interested.

738
01:02:24,232 --> 01:02:26,621
How could the Eddies
have such a good little earner?

739
01:02:26,672 --> 01:02:30,665
- They hid you like a dirty little secret.
- Find out who's behind this.

740
01:02:30,712 --> 01:02:31,906
Who's behind this?

741
01:02:33,152 --> 01:02:35,871
Ask no questions, hear no lies.

742
01:02:35,912 --> 01:02:39,029
- They tell anything but the truth.
- Find out if Green is behind this.

743
01:02:39,072 --> 01:02:43,270
- Is Jake Green behind this?
- I'll tell you, no, it's not Jake Green.

744
01:02:43,312 --> 01:02:47,544
- They'd do anything to protect their investment.
- I'm not sharing the golden goose.

745
01:02:47,592 --> 01:02:50,789
But Macha got his interest,
so he kept loaning them more and more.

746
01:02:50,832 --> 01:02:52,584
Lend them the money.

747
01:02:52,632 --> 01:02:56,545
You were back gambling, making more money
than you knew what to do with. You were rich.

748
01:02:56,592 --> 01:02:58,583
I am rich.

749
01:02:58,632 --> 01:03:00,429
Seriously fucking rich.

750
01:03:00,472 --> 01:03:04,385
After a year, you had enough of the Eddies'
money, or should I say Macha's money...

751
01:03:04,432 --> 01:03:09,062
- Now I'm richer. A lot fucking richer.
...to buy a chain of hotels.

752
01:03:09,112 --> 01:03:11,467
So you went on a discreet three-month holiday.

753
01:03:11,512 --> 01:03:15,346
You took your brother, his daughter,
Macha's money and you enjoyed yourself.

754
01:03:15,392 --> 01:03:19,180
A bit of the old sun, sand, sea and sausages.

755
01:03:19,232 --> 01:03:22,144
The Eddies meanwhile
were having a terminal argument...

756
01:03:23,192 --> 01:03:27,231
...about how they were going to pay back Macha
that obscene amount of cash they owed him.

757
01:03:27,272 --> 01:03:29,467
I want my money back, Paul.

758
01:03:32,832 --> 01:03:37,064
Those boys really suffered, Jake. The more
they told the truth, the more they suffered.

759
01:03:39,552 --> 01:03:42,464
- It's Jake Green.
- He's telling the fucking truth.

760
01:03:43,432 --> 01:03:46,265
They told me that story already.
Give me the truth.

761
01:03:47,272 --> 01:03:49,706
You gave them just enough rope
to hang themselves.

762
01:03:54,032 --> 01:03:56,023
You're a good little conman, Jake.

763
01:03:56,072 --> 01:04:02,591
And you think you're smart, and you are,
just not as smart as you think you are.

764
01:04:09,192 --> 01:04:11,183
Elvis. Come here.

765
01:04:13,272 --> 01:04:16,389
If I wanted vinegar,
I would have ordered French fries.

766
01:04:17,432 --> 01:04:20,504
Get me something with a price tag on it.

767
01:04:22,472 --> 01:04:25,350
...Mr. Green. What did he do, anyway?

768
01:04:26,952 --> 01:04:28,943
Hamish?

769
01:04:32,912 --> 01:04:36,427
It's OK, we're among friends.
Come on, what have you got for me?

770
01:04:39,152 --> 01:04:40,949
What am I going to tell him?

771
01:04:40,992 --> 01:04:44,507
That's your problem, but it had better be good.

772
01:04:46,472 --> 01:04:48,463
I turned up to pick them up...

773
01:05:01,512 --> 01:05:03,628
...and that is what I saw.

774
01:05:07,632 --> 01:05:09,623
That's a fascinating story.

775
01:05:11,032 --> 01:05:13,023
I have one question for you.

776
01:05:14,632 --> 01:05:16,748
How?

777
01:05:16,792 --> 01:05:18,544
How what?

778
01:05:18,592 --> 01:05:20,583
"How what?"

779
01:05:20,632 --> 01:05:22,623
There were six of us,

780
01:05:22,672 --> 01:05:25,311
plus Slim Biggins, who counts as another six.

781
01:05:25,352 --> 01:05:27,229
How many were there of him?

782
01:05:29,512 --> 01:05:31,628
- One.
- One.

783
01:05:33,072 --> 01:05:38,510
So, how exactly did this "one"
manage to disarm and overpower

784
01:05:38,552 --> 01:05:41,908
a four-time national body-building champion,

785
01:05:44,672 --> 01:05:51,305
drag him half a block, throw him over a six-foot
wall and then get him to eat his own gun?

786
01:05:56,872 --> 01:05:58,544
Get down, boss.

787
01:05:59,432 --> 01:06:01,423
Just find the gunman.

788
01:06:02,672 --> 01:06:04,788
Don't fucking move.

789
01:06:04,832 --> 01:06:06,629
Lou. Lou.

790
01:06:07,912 --> 01:06:10,346
- Keep the boss down.
- What the fuck's going on?

791
01:06:13,112 --> 01:06:14,943
I don't know.

792
01:06:14,992 --> 01:06:17,301
Sorter just shot the...

793
01:06:19,512 --> 01:06:21,582
...and he went in the kitchen.

794
01:06:21,632 --> 01:06:24,146
- Nobody fucking move.
- Bastard.

795
01:06:31,512 --> 01:06:33,343
Keep the fucking boss down.

796
01:08:50,192 --> 01:08:52,308
She shot my finger off.

797
01:08:52,352 --> 01:08:54,229
The bitch shot my finger off.

798
01:09:03,752 --> 01:09:05,743
Who is it?

799
01:09:10,392 --> 01:09:11,825
Happy Tony, Lord John's man.

800
01:09:12,872 --> 01:09:15,705
Not looking so happy now, is he?

801
01:09:20,472 --> 01:09:22,190
Check she's dead, Lou.

802
01:09:23,032 --> 01:09:25,068
Greed gets them all in the end.

803
01:09:30,152 --> 01:09:32,188
Now, shoot straight, Sorter.

804
01:09:32,232 --> 01:09:34,871
Glad to see you've got those feelings in check.

805
01:09:42,032 --> 01:09:47,060
Find a couple of Lord John's boys and
persuade them to tell you where my powder is.

806
01:11:16,432 --> 01:11:19,230
What is the first rule of any game, Mr. Green?

807
01:11:21,232 --> 01:11:24,827
The only way to get smarter
is by playing a smarter opponent.

808
01:11:24,872 --> 01:11:27,466
What's rule two of any game?

809
01:11:27,512 --> 01:11:31,266
The more sophisticated the game,
the more sophisticated the opponent.

810
01:11:32,312 --> 01:11:34,906
Almost the same,
but where does it stop, Mr. Green?

811
01:11:35,952 --> 01:11:38,182
Where does this game stop?

812
01:11:38,232 --> 01:11:40,951
It stops when you start to give me answers.

813
01:11:40,992 --> 01:11:43,301
Don't let them play head games with you, Jake.

814
01:11:43,352 --> 01:11:46,025
Is it me that's playing head games with you,
Mr. Green?

815
01:11:53,432 --> 01:11:56,583
You've heard their voice for so long,
you believe it to be you.

816
01:11:58,512 --> 01:12:01,072
You believe it to be your best friend.

817
01:12:01,672 --> 01:12:04,823
They should believe
their opponent to be their best friend.

818
01:12:04,872 --> 01:12:07,466
Where's the best place
an opponent should hide?

819
01:12:09,152 --> 01:12:12,030
In the very last place you would ever look.

820
01:12:12,072 --> 01:12:15,667
Do you know who Sam Gold is, Mr. Green?

821
01:12:15,712 --> 01:12:17,703
You should,

822
01:12:17,752 --> 01:12:20,425
because he knows who you are.

823
01:12:20,472 --> 01:12:22,269
The Gold,

824
01:12:22,312 --> 01:12:24,109
Sam Gold.

825
01:12:24,152 --> 01:12:25,824
Mr. Clandestine.

826
01:12:25,872 --> 01:12:27,669
Mr. Ambiguous.

827
01:12:27,712 --> 01:12:30,021
Mr. Mystery.

828
01:12:30,072 --> 01:12:32,063
He's all up here,

829
01:12:33,112 --> 01:12:35,023
pretending to be you.

830
01:12:35,072 --> 01:12:37,427
No-one sees Gold,

831
01:12:37,472 --> 01:12:39,781
but Gold sees everything.

832
01:12:39,832 --> 01:12:41,823
You're in a game, Jake.

833
01:12:41,872 --> 01:12:43,863
You're in the game.

834
01:12:44,912 --> 01:12:46,903
Everyone's in his game,

835
01:12:46,952 --> 01:12:48,943
and nobody knows it.

836
01:12:48,992 --> 01:12:53,065
And all of this, this is his world.

837
01:12:53,112 --> 01:12:54,545
He owns it.

838
01:12:55,592 --> 01:12:57,787
He controls it.

839
01:12:57,832 --> 01:13:00,824
I've had enough of this shit.
Tell him you've had enough.

840
01:13:00,872 --> 01:13:02,464
He tells you what to do...

841
01:13:02,512 --> 01:13:04,980
- Look, that's enough.
...and when to do it.

842
01:13:05,032 --> 01:13:08,229
- Tell him.
- I said that's enough, Avi.

843
01:13:08,272 --> 01:13:12,345
Eventually, when the opponent
is challenged or questioned,

844
01:13:12,392 --> 01:13:16,670
it means the victim's investment
and thus his intelligence is questioned.

845
01:13:17,672 --> 01:13:19,390
No-one can accept that,

846
01:13:20,432 --> 01:13:22,468
not even to themselves.

847
01:13:24,912 --> 01:13:27,790
He's behind all the pain there ever was.

848
01:13:29,912 --> 01:13:33,029
Behind every crime ever committed.

849
01:13:38,392 --> 01:13:44,831
How can I be behind all the pain,
all the crime, if I don't even exist?

850
01:13:44,872 --> 01:13:50,947
And right now,
he's telling you that he doesn't even exist.

851
01:13:53,272 --> 01:13:57,550
No-one lives and displeases Gold.

852
01:13:57,592 --> 01:13:59,503
No-one but your two friends.

853
01:14:00,552 --> 01:14:04,147
We just put you to war
with the only enemy that ever existed,

854
01:14:04,192 --> 01:14:07,229
and you, you think he's your best friend.

855
01:14:07,272 --> 01:14:11,982
And they will protect their best friend
with everything they've got.

856
01:14:13,032 --> 01:14:15,910
You're protecting him, Mr. Green,

857
01:14:18,032 --> 01:14:20,023
but with what?

858
01:14:20,072 --> 01:14:22,984
Where's the best place
an opponent should hide?

859
01:14:25,392 --> 01:14:27,508
In the very last place you'd ever look.

860
01:14:27,552 --> 01:14:30,510
He's hiding behind your pain, Jake.

861
01:14:35,032 --> 01:14:37,148
You're protecting him with your pain.

862
01:14:38,152 --> 01:14:43,146
Embrace the pain and you will win this game.

863
01:14:45,352 --> 01:14:50,870
And I know nothing hurts more
than humiliation and a little money loss.

864
01:14:50,912 --> 01:14:54,143
If you change the rules on what controls you...

865
01:14:54,192 --> 01:14:58,105
...you will change the rules
on what you can control.

866
01:14:59,112 --> 01:15:02,468
How radical are you prepared to be, Mr. Green?

867
01:15:25,632 --> 01:15:28,988
The more power
you think you have in Gold's world,

868
01:15:29,032 --> 01:15:31,990
the less power you have in the real world.

869
01:15:34,672 --> 01:15:36,663
You are still in prison, Jake.

870
01:15:36,712 --> 01:15:39,704
In fact, you never left.

871
01:15:39,752 --> 01:15:43,950
Remember who they are, Jake.
Head tricksters, word slicksters.

872
01:15:43,992 --> 01:15:46,506
You wanted answers and they gave you riddles.

873
01:15:46,552 --> 01:15:50,022
You know the rules,
the longer you listened, the sweeter the pitch.

874
01:15:50,072 --> 01:15:53,144
He's got all the tricks and all the right answers.

875
01:15:54,472 --> 01:15:58,988
Don't let them do this to you, Jake.
Don't let them turn you against you.

876
01:16:01,872 --> 01:16:05,751
You don't give because it's good.
You give because it hurts him.

877
01:16:26,312 --> 01:16:28,303
What are we doing here?

878
01:16:29,312 --> 01:16:31,906
He's the enemy, Jake, not me.

879
01:16:31,952 --> 01:16:35,786
Use your perceived enemy
to destroy your real enemy.

880
01:16:35,832 --> 01:16:39,347
Do not listen, Jake.
You've got a gun. Use it.

881
01:16:40,752 --> 01:16:42,708
Don't wake him up. Suffocate him.

882
01:16:42,752 --> 01:16:45,744
Put the pillow over his head and suffocate him.

883
01:16:45,792 --> 01:16:48,431
He'd do it to you, Jake.

884
01:16:48,472 --> 01:16:51,191
If you can't do it, then you're not a free man.

885
01:16:51,232 --> 01:16:53,507
You are controlled.

886
01:16:53,552 --> 01:16:56,066
"Controlled? Free man?"

887
01:16:56,112 --> 01:16:58,467
Jake, wake up.

888
01:17:07,232 --> 01:17:11,623
Look, Mr. Macha, I'm very sorry
to have woken you. Please listen to me.

889
01:17:13,832 --> 01:17:16,346
Who's that? Mr. Green?

890
01:17:16,392 --> 01:17:20,704
Mr. Macha, please, I'm sorry to have woken you.
Listen to me.

891
01:17:20,752 --> 01:17:23,061
"Sorry." Listen at how you sound.

892
01:17:24,432 --> 01:17:26,184
I came to apologize.

893
01:17:26,232 --> 01:17:30,111
Forgive me for the things I've said
and for cheating you out of your money.

894
01:17:30,152 --> 01:17:31,904
I couldn't think clearly.

895
01:17:31,952 --> 01:17:34,147
- Shut up.
- No, no, that's too much.

896
01:17:34,192 --> 01:17:38,185
Shoot the fucker. Shoot him.
He's been trying to kill you.

897
01:17:38,232 --> 01:17:41,224
He killed your friend, shot like a fucking dog.

898
01:17:42,272 --> 01:17:45,901
That's better, Jake, in control again.
Do the right thing.

899
01:17:45,952 --> 01:17:48,830
Take care of your enemy, take care of business.

900
01:17:48,872 --> 01:17:53,388
Use any means possible
to induce head pain, and engage the enemy.

901
01:17:53,432 --> 01:17:55,229
Shut up.

902
01:17:55,272 --> 01:17:58,105
Wake up, Jake.
What are you fucking doing?

903
01:17:58,152 --> 01:18:00,143
Leave it.

904
01:18:00,192 --> 01:18:02,183
You're groveling.

905
01:18:02,232 --> 01:18:05,463
I now realize you're a man
to be feared and respected.

906
01:18:09,152 --> 01:18:12,064
I now realize you're a man
to be feared and respected.

907
01:18:12,112 --> 01:18:13,943
Stop groveling.

908
01:18:15,832 --> 01:18:17,823
Where's your pride?

909
01:18:24,392 --> 01:18:25,666
Where's your pride?

910
01:18:25,712 --> 01:18:28,510
I made a big mistake, Mr. Macha.
Shut up.

911
01:18:28,552 --> 01:18:31,589
I underestimated your power and your intellect.

912
01:18:31,632 --> 01:18:35,181
I've made a donation in your name
as a peace offering,

913
01:18:36,232 --> 01:18:38,427
as a token of my apology.

914
01:18:40,072 --> 01:18:42,427
I want you to...

915
01:18:42,472 --> 01:18:44,463
Shut up.

916
01:18:44,512 --> 01:18:46,343
I want you to forgive my stupidity.

917
01:19:08,232 --> 01:19:12,862
Wherever you don't want to go
is where you will find him.

918
01:19:14,912 --> 01:19:17,870
What is it that you are afraid of, Mr. Green?

919
01:20:01,232 --> 01:20:03,826
Why are you doing this to yourself, Jake?

920
01:20:03,872 --> 01:20:05,863
It's too tight, Jake.

921
01:20:06,912 --> 01:20:08,903
We've got to get out.

922
01:20:09,912 --> 01:20:12,187
You're going to die in a tiny space, Jake.

923
01:20:16,872 --> 01:20:18,863
Have to get out.

924
01:20:21,912 --> 01:20:23,709
We're stuck, stuck.

925
01:20:23,752 --> 01:20:25,743
The walls are moving in.

926
01:20:27,432 --> 01:20:29,423
It's tight. I'm scared.

927
01:20:29,472 --> 01:20:32,430
We've got to get out. I can hear you.

928
01:20:36,432 --> 01:20:38,229
I can hear you.

929
01:20:38,272 --> 01:20:39,261
What?

930
01:20:39,312 --> 01:20:41,587
I can hear you.

931
01:20:41,632 --> 01:20:43,827
I'm onto you.

932
01:20:50,432 --> 01:20:53,151
Who takes care of the good times?

933
01:20:53,192 --> 01:20:55,831
- We're a team.
- We're best pals, Jake.

934
01:20:55,872 --> 01:20:59,865
- You want to get rid of me?
- Do you know life without me?

935
01:20:59,912 --> 01:21:03,587
- No. Because it doesn't...
...exist.

936
01:21:03,632 --> 01:21:05,384
- Do they talk about me, Jake?
- No.

937
01:21:05,432 --> 01:21:07,423
Because I don't exist.

938
01:21:07,472 --> 01:21:11,590
- Tell all your friends about me then, Jake?
- I protect you and I control you.

939
01:21:11,632 --> 01:21:13,623
I say do, you obey.

940
01:21:13,672 --> 01:21:16,425
- If I say you're scared...
...you're scared.

941
01:21:16,472 --> 01:21:19,464
You've been listening to the other side,
haven't you, Jake?

942
01:21:19,512 --> 01:21:22,504
- Listening to people who want to hurt you.
- New people. New.

943
01:21:22,552 --> 01:21:24,543
Not old friends like me.

944
01:21:24,592 --> 01:21:29,029
People you shouldn't trust. Not me. I've been
your friend forever, since the beginning.

945
01:21:29,072 --> 01:21:32,064
Get rid of them, Jake, forever.
They're the enemy, not me.

946
01:21:32,112 --> 01:21:35,149
They're new, I'm old. I stay, they go.

947
01:21:35,192 --> 01:21:37,626
I say you do.

948
01:21:37,672 --> 01:21:38,741
You do.

949
01:21:38,792 --> 01:21:40,783
You're weak without me, weak.

950
01:21:40,832 --> 01:21:42,550
It's us against them, Jake.

951
01:21:42,592 --> 01:21:45,026
It's us against them.

952
01:21:45,072 --> 01:21:47,381
I'm coming to get you.

953
01:21:47,432 --> 01:21:50,071
You want to get rid of me?
You want to make an enemy out of me?

954
01:21:50,112 --> 01:21:52,182
You want to get rid of me, do you?

955
01:21:52,232 --> 01:21:53,745
Do you?

956
01:21:53,792 --> 01:21:56,226
You want to get rid of me, me, me, me?

957
01:22:10,952 --> 01:22:13,466
Still here, Jake?

958
01:22:13,512 --> 01:22:16,822
How long have I looked after you?

959
01:22:16,872 --> 01:22:18,942
You can't win this one without me.

960
01:22:20,552 --> 01:22:23,066
You know why?

961
01:22:24,112 --> 01:22:26,103
I am you.

962
01:22:29,152 --> 01:22:31,143
You ain't me.

963
01:22:32,432 --> 01:22:40,908
The greatest con that he ever pulled,
was making you believe that he is you.

964
01:22:42,232 --> 01:22:44,427
You ain't me.

965
01:22:44,472 --> 01:22:47,669
- I am you.
- You're not me.

966
01:22:47,712 --> 01:22:49,191
Come on.

967
01:22:52,192 --> 01:22:54,342
Your best fucking friend.

968
01:22:58,112 --> 01:23:00,467
I am you.

969
01:23:09,832 --> 01:23:11,823
You don't control me.

970
01:23:12,792 --> 01:23:14,544
I control you.

971
01:23:45,832 --> 01:23:50,189
You come to my house with a loaded gun.

972
01:23:51,432 --> 01:23:55,550
You speak to me like I'm a fucking idiot.

973
01:23:56,992 --> 01:23:58,983
What's your game?

974
01:24:00,432 --> 01:24:02,423
What's your game?

975
01:24:03,832 --> 01:24:05,823
Speak to me.

976
01:24:07,512 --> 01:24:09,503
Speak to me.

977
01:24:09,552 --> 01:24:13,067
Or I'll kill you like the fucking dog that you are.

978
01:24:19,632 --> 01:24:21,623
Fear me.

979
01:24:32,432 --> 01:24:34,582
Fear me.

980
01:25:35,432 --> 01:25:38,822
We have already killed Lord John
and two of your colleagues.

981
01:25:38,872 --> 01:25:42,660
If you value your life
more than a few bags of white powder,

982
01:25:42,712 --> 01:25:44,703
you will tell me...

983
01:25:44,752 --> 01:25:46,708
where it is hidden.

984
01:26:11,792 --> 01:26:13,783
Is everything all right, Mr. D?

985
01:26:14,832 --> 01:26:17,630
It will be when you take care
of my security, Paul.

986
01:26:18,752 --> 01:26:20,743
What are you holding the papers for?

987
01:26:21,792 --> 01:26:24,625
Because you're on the cover of half of them.

988
01:26:26,272 --> 01:26:29,662
If you don't mind me asking,
what has come over you, Mr. D?

989
01:26:34,152 --> 01:26:36,143
They think you did it.

990
01:26:40,112 --> 01:26:43,468
Oh, my god.
Take the credit, they'll never know.

991
01:26:44,512 --> 01:26:46,867
This feels good.

992
01:26:53,312 --> 01:26:55,303
This feels quite good.

993
01:26:55,352 --> 01:26:57,547
I'm going to take the credit.

994
01:26:58,592 --> 01:27:00,787
It might come as a surprise to you, Paul,

995
01:27:03,312 --> 01:27:05,303
but I do have a heart.

996
01:27:08,832 --> 01:27:11,221
I have some news about Green.

997
01:27:11,272 --> 01:27:13,661
I'll give you news about Green.

998
01:27:13,712 --> 01:27:16,704
He now knows who's boss.

999
01:27:16,752 --> 01:27:20,586
He was sniveling like a baby
begging for forgiveness.

1000
01:27:20,632 --> 01:27:24,671
It was embarrassing. We're not going to
be hearing from Mr. Green for a while.

1001
01:27:24,712 --> 01:27:27,704
I'm not sure if that's the case, Mr. D.

1002
01:27:28,752 --> 01:27:31,346
Whilst you've been sleeping, we've been busy.

1003
01:27:31,392 --> 01:27:36,910
If Lord John's boys know where the powder is,
they took it to the grave.

1004
01:27:36,952 --> 01:27:39,512
We know Green's behind everything.

1005
01:27:39,552 --> 01:27:42,305
He took your powder, not Lord John.

1006
01:27:42,352 --> 01:27:46,903
He's been playing games with us,
and he's been playing games with you.

1007
01:27:46,952 --> 01:27:49,068
Fear me. Fear me.

1008
01:27:49,112 --> 01:27:51,387
- Shut up.
- Fear me.

1009
01:27:51,432 --> 01:27:53,707
- Shut up.
- Fear me.

1010
01:27:53,752 --> 01:27:57,062
- It doesn't look good.
- Shut up.

1011
01:27:57,112 --> 01:28:00,627
It doesn't look good.
The drums have been talking.

1012
01:28:10,432 --> 01:28:12,388
And what have the drums been saying?

1013
01:28:12,432 --> 01:28:15,947
They've been saying
what Sam Gold's been hearing.

1014
01:28:18,232 --> 01:28:20,427
Fear me.

1015
01:28:20,472 --> 01:28:25,307
Hearing about the little problems Mr. Green
has been giving us, that's embarrassing.

1016
01:28:25,352 --> 01:28:28,583
We have an address for his brother.
We can take care of it.

1017
01:28:28,632 --> 01:28:31,021
Get him to talk, do whatever it takes.

1018
01:28:31,072 --> 01:28:34,189
Take Sorter and an army.
If they give any trouble, hurt 'em.

1019
01:28:34,232 --> 01:28:36,223
Let me read about that in the paper.

1020
01:28:36,272 --> 01:28:39,742
Get a hold of Green and get my powder.

1021
01:28:41,032 --> 01:28:42,943
Go.

1022
01:28:58,832 --> 01:29:00,868
Are we expecting anyone?

1023
01:29:00,912 --> 01:29:03,506
I'll get it.

1024
01:29:03,552 --> 01:29:06,350
I said, are we expecting anyone?

1025
01:29:06,392 --> 01:29:08,383
Shouldn't you check first?

1026
01:29:20,352 --> 01:29:25,426
If you love your daddy,
be a good girl, hide in that cupboard.

1027
01:29:25,472 --> 01:29:27,463
Now.

1028
01:29:54,832 --> 01:29:56,868
Check the house.

1029
01:29:59,432 --> 01:30:01,582
You know why we're here?

1030
01:30:04,632 --> 01:30:06,190
Serpent.

1031
01:30:11,232 --> 01:30:16,704
I said, do you know why we're here?

1032
01:30:17,752 --> 01:30:20,630
I've some kind of an idea, yes.

1033
01:30:21,672 --> 01:30:23,947
Are you going to tell me?

1034
01:30:23,992 --> 01:30:25,983
Paul, I swear to you,

1035
01:30:27,032 --> 01:30:29,705
I haven't got a fucking clue where he is.

1036
01:30:35,712 --> 01:30:37,703
He's been moving about.

1037
01:30:38,752 --> 01:30:41,141
I swear to you, I have no idea where he is.

1038
01:30:45,712 --> 01:30:47,703
It's all right.

1039
01:30:50,712 --> 01:30:53,784
That's it. That's better. That's better.

1040
01:31:09,992 --> 01:31:12,552
I still don't believe you.

1041
01:31:19,192 --> 01:31:22,468
You can't trust anyone.
They're out to destroy me.

1042
01:31:22,512 --> 01:31:24,901
They're out to destroy you.

1043
01:31:24,952 --> 01:31:27,671
- You can't trust anyone.
- I can't trust anyone.

1044
01:31:29,712 --> 01:31:31,703
Can't let Gold down.

1045
01:31:32,752 --> 01:31:34,743
He'll finish the business.

1046
01:31:35,792 --> 01:31:37,783
Then he'll finish me.

1047
01:31:39,192 --> 01:31:41,183
He's coming.

1048
01:31:41,232 --> 01:31:43,223
I won't see it coming.

1049
01:31:47,992 --> 01:31:50,984
He's coming. And I won't see it coming.

1050
01:31:51,032 --> 01:31:53,023
There's a woman here to see you, Mr. D.

1051
01:31:55,552 --> 01:31:57,543
Said she cannot wait.

1052
01:31:59,232 --> 01:32:01,223
Don't tell me her name.

1053
01:32:01,272 --> 01:32:04,742
- Says she works for Gold.
- Don't tell me her name. Anyone but her.

1054
01:32:04,792 --> 01:32:07,431
- What's her name?
- Walker.

1055
01:32:07,472 --> 01:32:08,621
Anyone but her.

1056
01:32:08,672 --> 01:32:12,506
And everybody thought you were
such a disgusting man, Mr. Macha.

1057
01:32:13,672 --> 01:32:16,550
Here it comes. Here it comes.

1058
01:32:16,592 --> 01:32:20,551
Mr. Gold wishes to extend his respect
for such a magnanimous gesture.

1059
01:32:20,592 --> 01:32:22,310
But he was wondering...

1060
01:32:22,352 --> 01:32:24,547
- That's a wreath.
- That's a fucking wreath.

1061
01:32:24,592 --> 01:32:27,390
...if you can afford the time to give so generously,

1062
01:32:27,432 --> 01:32:29,946
why you haven't had time
to conclude our business?

1063
01:32:29,992 --> 01:32:32,142
Everything's under control. I need more time.

1064
01:32:32,192 --> 01:32:35,184
It's anything but under control,
isn't it, Mr. Macha?

1065
01:32:36,792 --> 01:32:38,783
Mr. Gold doesn't give more time.

1066
01:32:40,832 --> 01:32:42,743
And he doesn't give second chances.

1067
01:32:46,032 --> 01:32:48,023
You will be hearing from him.

1068
01:32:48,072 --> 01:32:49,824
Good day.

1069
01:32:49,872 --> 01:32:52,705
"Good day?" What the fuck does that mean?

1070
01:32:52,752 --> 01:32:54,743
What the fuck does that mean?

1071
01:32:54,792 --> 01:32:57,260
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to?

1072
01:32:57,312 --> 01:32:59,303
Some fucking street hustler?

1073
01:32:59,352 --> 01:33:03,106
If he wants to meet me, you send him here
and we'll see what he has to say.

1074
01:33:05,192 --> 01:33:07,501
I'll kill 'em, I'll kill all of 'em.

1075
01:33:07,552 --> 01:33:09,543
I'll kill 'em first.

1076
01:33:09,592 --> 01:33:12,664
They'll kill us first, they'll fucking annihilate me.

1077
01:33:12,712 --> 01:33:14,703
Beg, beg. Take it back, beg, beg.

1078
01:33:14,752 --> 01:33:16,743
Beg, you idiot.

1079
01:33:16,792 --> 01:33:20,182
Wait, wait. I didn't mean what I just said.

1080
01:33:26,912 --> 01:33:29,710
"Good day?" What the fuck does that mean?

1081
01:33:29,752 --> 01:33:34,109
That means he's going to end my game
and I won't see it coming.

1082
01:34:12,032 --> 01:34:14,341
I'm going to make this fair.

1083
01:34:14,392 --> 01:34:16,064
This...

1084
01:34:17,112 --> 01:34:19,103
...is for you.

1085
01:34:21,992 --> 01:34:23,550
These...

1086
01:34:25,192 --> 01:34:27,183
...for me.

1087
01:34:30,232 --> 01:34:34,783
One good chop, and you'll make the sink.

1088
01:34:37,992 --> 01:34:40,108
OK, that's enough.

1089
01:34:42,952 --> 01:34:47,264
Question me again, Sorter,
and we will have a falling out.

1090
01:34:58,232 --> 01:35:00,302
Tell me what's happening, Lou.

1091
01:35:00,352 --> 01:35:04,948
I got tired of waiting by the car, so I went inside.

1092
01:35:04,992 --> 01:35:09,747
Paul, he was getting excited,
you know how he does.

1093
01:35:09,792 --> 01:35:11,942
He started messing with the little girl's hair.

1094
01:35:11,992 --> 01:35:13,584
Out of nowhere, Sorter shot him.

1095
01:35:13,632 --> 01:35:15,509
Your daddy loves you so much.

1096
01:35:15,552 --> 01:35:16,951
- Shot who?
- Paul.

1097
01:35:19,232 --> 01:35:22,827
Then he turned the gun on the two bodyguards,
both gone in a blink of an eye.

1098
01:35:28,432 --> 01:35:30,423
Listen to me, sweetheart.

1099
01:35:30,472 --> 01:35:32,622
None of this is real.

1100
01:35:32,672 --> 01:35:35,027
It's just a game that the grown-ups are playing.

1101
01:35:36,112 --> 01:35:37,909
Now what I want you to do,

1102
01:35:37,952 --> 01:35:42,104
I want you to get in the cupboard
and I want you to put your fingers in your ears,

1103
01:35:42,152 --> 01:35:44,222
and it'll be all over before you know it.

1104
01:35:44,272 --> 01:35:46,263
Do as the man says, babe.

1105
01:35:46,312 --> 01:35:48,780
Put your fingers in your ears
and go in the cupboard.

1106
01:35:49,512 --> 01:35:50,831
Good girl.

1107
01:35:50,872 --> 01:35:52,908
Pull yourself together, man.

1108
01:35:52,952 --> 01:35:56,149
Sorter, we're going to have to take the girl.

1109
01:35:56,192 --> 01:35:59,662
Of course you have.
Now all you've got to do is come and get her.

1110
01:37:55,392 --> 01:37:57,348
I'm the only one left.

1111
01:37:57,392 --> 01:37:58,791
Where's the girl?

1112
01:38:08,832 --> 01:38:10,823
What are we doing here?

1113
01:38:10,872 --> 01:38:12,863
One last treat,

1114
01:38:12,912 --> 01:38:14,903
and bring the powder.

1115
01:38:24,432 --> 01:38:26,502
Jake Green is in the Casino.

1116
01:38:29,152 --> 01:38:31,143
How the fuck does he know?

1117
01:38:48,632 --> 01:38:50,463
Why are we here?

1118
01:38:50,512 --> 01:38:52,503
You have a meeting.

1119
01:38:54,312 --> 01:38:56,303
Got a little time to spare.

1120
01:38:56,352 --> 01:38:58,502
Let's have a game.

1121
01:38:58,552 --> 01:39:00,827
Bring him up.

1122
01:39:19,432 --> 01:39:22,629
You know what's so elegant
about this little game, Jake?

1123
01:39:24,792 --> 01:39:26,783
Nobody knows where the enemy is.

1124
01:39:27,832 --> 01:39:29,982
They don't even know he exists.

1125
01:39:36,232 --> 01:39:38,826
He's in every one of their heads.

1126
01:39:38,872 --> 01:39:40,703
And they trust him...

1127
01:39:43,792 --> 01:39:45,783
...because they think they are him.

1128
01:39:48,712 --> 01:39:55,185
If you try to destroy him to save them,
they'll destroy you to save him.

1129
01:39:55,232 --> 01:39:57,223
It's beautiful, man.

1130
01:39:58,032 --> 01:40:00,865
You have to admire the opponent's elegance.

1131
01:40:00,912 --> 01:40:02,743
Check.

1132
01:40:07,312 --> 01:40:11,988
You're quite good at this game, Mr. Green.
I know because I'm quite good at this game.

1133
01:40:16,472 --> 01:40:18,064
Check.

1134
01:40:26,072 --> 01:40:27,471
Check.

1135
01:40:34,832 --> 01:40:37,266
Check.

1136
01:40:45,432 --> 01:40:50,552
The art is for me to feed pieces to you,
and make you believe you took those pieces,

1137
01:40:50,592 --> 01:40:54,790
because you're smarter and I'm dumber.

1138
01:41:05,512 --> 01:41:06,627
Checkmate.

1139
01:41:20,952 --> 01:41:22,863
Wake up, Mr. Green.

1140
01:41:27,032 --> 01:41:29,102
You can't see what's right in front of you.

1141
01:41:35,192 --> 01:41:38,502
I never saw or spoke to those boys
in all those years,

1142
01:41:38,552 --> 01:41:41,988
but you know
I would have died for either one of them.

1143
01:41:42,032 --> 01:41:45,263
One was a chess master,
the other a master conman.

1144
01:41:45,312 --> 01:41:48,702
Dangerous combination, chess and cons.

1145
01:41:51,912 --> 01:41:54,062
Those two knew everything about me.

1146
01:41:54,112 --> 01:41:57,787
All my dirty little secrets,
how much money I had, where I kept it.

1147
01:41:57,832 --> 01:42:00,266
Hustling bastards cleaned me out.

1148
01:42:06,152 --> 01:42:09,861
My neighbors used to write down chess moves
and concepts of the con

1149
01:42:09,912 --> 01:42:15,270
in the back pages of books based on subjects
like The Mathematics Of Quantum Mechanics.

1150
01:42:15,312 --> 01:42:16,540
Wake up, Mr. Green.

1151
01:42:16,592 --> 01:42:19,390
We were all going to go together,
they swore to me.

1152
01:42:19,432 --> 01:42:21,502
"You're coming with us, Jake."

1153
01:42:21,552 --> 01:42:24,589
We were always going to take you with us, Jake.

1154
01:42:24,632 --> 01:42:28,750
You just weren't ready to hear
how hard that was going to be.

1155
01:42:33,352 --> 01:42:35,422
We didn't do this because we like you.

1156
01:42:36,872 --> 01:42:38,863
We did this because...

1157
01:42:41,312 --> 01:42:43,382
...we are you.

1158
01:43:00,672 --> 01:43:02,663
Time for that meeting.

1159
01:43:03,712 --> 01:43:06,146
Give him what he wants.

1160
01:43:06,192 --> 01:43:08,308
I'm sure that will make him very happy.

1161
01:43:25,112 --> 01:43:29,628
I know you're still there,
cos I can feel you dying.

1162
01:43:30,672 --> 01:43:34,551
I can hear you, tapping me for a little nutrition.

1163
01:43:36,552 --> 01:43:38,543
Now who's clucking for a fix?

1164
01:43:38,592 --> 01:43:41,345
Think it's a little tight in here, do you?

1165
01:43:42,352 --> 01:43:46,550
You're not wrong,
cos the walls are moving in.

1166
01:43:47,592 --> 01:43:50,789
No food here, not today, sunshine.

1167
01:43:51,832 --> 01:43:54,505
My eyes are open and the restaurant's closed.

1168
01:43:54,552 --> 01:43:57,464
Jog on, slide off.

1169
01:43:57,512 --> 01:44:00,106
Find someone else to fill your pipe,

1170
01:44:00,152 --> 01:44:05,863
someone who won't see you coming
or know when you're there.

1171
01:44:11,632 --> 01:44:15,944
You think I'm an evil man.
You think I am an evil man, don't you?

1172
01:44:17,392 --> 01:44:20,111
Rachel, look at me, honey.

1173
01:44:23,992 --> 01:44:26,460
Think I don't know your fucking game?

1174
01:44:26,512 --> 01:44:30,983
I do, I know your game,
I see your game, I am your game.

1175
01:44:31,032 --> 01:44:34,229
Rachel, look at me, baby.

1176
01:44:37,712 --> 01:44:40,863
You don't play by the rules, Mr. Green.

1177
01:44:40,912 --> 01:44:47,306
You like to play silly games with my head,
don't you?

1178
01:44:50,072 --> 01:44:53,348
- You're a fucking survivor,
- A winner.

1179
01:44:53,392 --> 01:44:57,271
- You're a pussy drowning in his own shit.
- Shut up and leave me alone.

1180
01:44:58,352 --> 01:45:00,912
He chose his hiding place very carefully.

1181
01:45:00,952 --> 01:45:03,750
I can't let him kill me.

1182
01:45:03,792 --> 01:45:05,783
You're weak. It's too late.

1183
01:45:05,832 --> 01:45:08,221
You're a dead man anyway.
You'll be dead before dawn.

1184
01:45:08,272 --> 01:45:10,786
The word "excuse" does not exist
in Sam Gold's lexicon.

1185
01:45:10,832 --> 01:45:13,141
This is Sam Gold I found myself chained to.

1186
01:45:13,192 --> 01:45:15,183
Mr. Black Magic.

1187
01:45:15,232 --> 01:45:17,223
Mr. "l-run-this-game" Gold.

1188
01:45:17,272 --> 01:45:20,150
We can't see Gold.
Apparently, no-one sees Gold.

1189
01:45:20,192 --> 01:45:21,910
No-one gets away from Gold.

1190
01:45:23,912 --> 01:45:25,709
Get control of yourself.

1191
01:45:25,752 --> 01:45:28,824
It's anything but under control,
isn't it, Mr. Macha?

1192
01:45:28,872 --> 01:45:33,388
He's going to kill me, he'll kill me.
Where's your pride? Where's your pride?

1193
01:45:37,312 --> 01:45:40,224
I'd rather kill myself than let him kill me.

1194
01:45:42,312 --> 01:45:45,543
Why isn't he scared? He's just staring at me.

1195
01:45:48,192 --> 01:45:51,662
- You'll be hearing from him.
- But he can't kill a dead man.

1196
01:45:51,712 --> 01:45:54,101
But he can't kill a dead man,

1197
01:45:54,152 --> 01:45:56,143
can he?

1198
01:46:00,032 --> 01:46:02,023
He can't kill a dead man, can he?

1199
01:46:08,352 --> 01:46:10,627
You can't even do it, can you?

1200
01:46:22,432 --> 01:46:25,549
The greatest con that he ever pulled

1201
01:46:26,592 --> 01:46:29,311
...was making you believe...

1202
01:46:30,352 --> 01:46:32,070
...that he is you.

1203
01:48:32,071 --> 01:48:34,871
