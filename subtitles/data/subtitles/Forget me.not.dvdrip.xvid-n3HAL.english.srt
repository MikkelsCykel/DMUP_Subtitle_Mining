1
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,873
Sandy?
- What's the matter, princess?

2
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,076
Honey, Sandy, what happened?

3
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,510
I don't remember.

4
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,038
Come in.

5
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,479
What is this ridiculous thing? Come here.
- It's called the Windsor knot.

6
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:09,111
It's like a noose.
- I got it at a Playboy's Guide to Style.

7
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,796
Oh my gosh, stick with the encyclopedia.
Got you where you are.

8
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:21,754
I mean, don't get me wrong, Sandy's a cool
chick but it's not like you're gonna marry her.

9
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,592
You're not gonna marry her, are you?

10
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,309
I don't have any thought of what I'm doing
next week. Never mind, the rest of my life.

11
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:32,998
Well, you could figure it out because I'm sure as shit Sandy has.
And you can bet your ass that her parents have some pretty
strong opinions on the subject.

12
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,639
And what's that suppose to mean?

13
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,839
Just think how they don't like their perfect
little princess banging big bad wolf.

14
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,278
I'm not banging her, Lex.
I'm dating her, faithfully.

15
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,036
Alright, next year when she's at Stanford
and you're slumming in at State...

16
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:54,833
I'll give you two months before she finds some
pre-med and you meet the entire cheering squad.

17
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,039
Oh, yeah? What about you and TJ?
- I wanna show you something.

18
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,998
Subtle.
- Gotta love it, right?

19
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,593
Is that wash off?

20
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,473
Chad, what is it?
- You gotta go.

21
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,432
Layla's here.

22
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:01,149
Wait, what? I thought you
said you broke up.

23
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,953
I lied.

24
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,115
You asshole. How could you...?
- Have you seen your body?

25
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,556
But I thought you said...
- You thought I said what..?

26
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,034
You never were a match for thinking.

27
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:27,116
Hey, pass.
- Nice arm...

28
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,271
For a girl.

29
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:35,675
Maybe I'll play college football too, huh.
- I got three words for you, TJ. Random drug test..

30
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,828
Too early for beer, ain't it?

31
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:47,279
You put all the others?
- Scholarships don't come on line everyday, Jake.

32
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:53,037
True, dude. Well, like every other day.
- One day they'll just stop coming, believe me.

33
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,474
Hey, daddy.

34
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:02,714
Going to the graduation party tonight?
- God, I hope not. TJ, do me a favor. Keep things under control, will you?

35
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:08,750
You're really embarrassing to bust my whole family.
- Rated G, PG at the worst.

36
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:17,592
It's rare to find students so qualified in the
same school and they belong in the same family.
-- Thank you, sir.

37
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:22,117
May your future be as bright as your past.
- Hear, hear.

38
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:27,115
Well, after college I'd like to become a doctor just like you.
- Then we'll be colleague someday.

39
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:32,434
Eli wants to be a doctor too, don't you Eli?
- Oh well, no actually, I was looking...

40
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,592
Actually my little brother wants to become a pirate.

41
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:42,751
I don't wanna become a pirate.
That's such fictional, I mean...

42
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:47,948
Well anyone that becomes valedictorian after
skipping a grade can do whatever he wants.
- Well thank you. Thank you very much.

43
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,958
You must be very proud.
- We are.

44
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:59,355
Then you'll even be more proud to learn that I'm
recommending both Sandy and Eli for full academic scholarship.

45
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,834
Just consider it a graduation
present for your parents.

46
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,639
We're going to Stanford.
- We are.

47
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,879
Well, enough of that boring stuff.
What are you two gonna get into this summer?

48
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,315
Just a little charity work, sir.

49
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,952
Ladies.

50
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,959
You're an asshole.
- I love you too.

51
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:52,038
Let's do some fucking shots.

52
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,673
New king in town, bitches.

53
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:01,231
All bow down before my lengthy lance.

54
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,750
You're so wet, good.

55
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:17,236
Have you ever wonder what I'd be like
to live in another time and place?

56
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:23,714
Like to exist in a completely formed reality
where societal conventions don't apply.

57
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,110
Like in France or something?

58
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,754
No, like, like...

59
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:34,357
I really wish I was a pirate.

60
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:38,957
Eli, you're so random.
- No seriously, think about it.

61
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:45,912
Like think about it. I can be a pirate
just like, sail over the world.

62
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,036
Have a parrot.

63
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:54,275
Crunches a sword and then rips a bodice.

64
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,874
What's a bodice?

65
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,196
Hey, there's my girl.
- Hey, baby.

66
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:06,478
Wasn't sure what you wanted? So I got vodka or rhum.
- How about both?

67
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,952
Whoa, easy. Whoa, whoa. What are you Irish?
- My mom thinks I'm staying at Hannah's tonight.

68
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,908
Then I'm gonna get a second round.
- Hey, come here.

69
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,799
I love you.
- I love you too.

70
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:25,474
You're so goddamn hot.
- Yeah, don't you forget it.

71
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,395
Oh if you ever cheat on me
I swear to God I'd kill the guy.

72
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:35,839
Don't worry baby. I don't want
anybody else. Not now, not ever.

73
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,073
Yeah, you hear that? This ass belongs to me.

74
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,239
Cheers.

75
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,671
I'm done here. I'm fucking wasted.

76
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,438
Hold it.

77
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:27,398
Jennifer Atkins back in my jeep,
driver's at the glass, summer school.

78
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,553
Ride that stick, baby.

79
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,392
You're a whore.

80
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,756
Alright, alright, alright. Dominic Sperduto...

81
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:45,111
9th grade, 50-yard line
at the football field.

82
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,273
Sperduto?
- What, he was good.

83
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,591
He was hairy, but it's good.

84
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,029
Shut up.
- What about you, Eli?

85
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:12,032
A gentleman doesn't kiss and tell.
- And what's that gotta do with you. Spill it, fish fag.

86
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,112
Fine. Your mom. Last night.

87
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,830
You don't know why it's always about my mother.

88
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,073
Eli, I wanna make fun of Chad just ask
him about the training in Tijuana.

89
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,196
I wanna hear about Sandy.

90
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,797
You know, sometimes some memory
lane should never be discussed.

91
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,988
But my first kiss, now that was pretty hot.

92
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,596
Boring.
- Wait, wait. I wanna hear it.

93
00:11:54,760 --> 00:12:01,199
Okay. Well, it was in the graveyard. You remember it?
- I remember it.

94
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,558
We were playing the game.
- I was there.

95
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:09,269
We were all there.
- Oh yeah, the game.

96
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,513
That was so fun.
- I was so scared.

97
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,834
Surrounded by all those dead bodies, so quiet.
I was the last one left.

98
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,993
And you were all out there looking
for me. Hunting me.

99
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:28,314
My heart was pounding, knowing that any second
someone was gonna jump out and grab me.

100
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,190
I didn't know whether I was gonna
have a heart attack or an orgasm.

101
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,239
Oh God, that sounds so hot.
- I'm hot.

102
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,038
And wet.

103
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,232
Grab the beers.
- Grab the beers.

104
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:02,593
Who wins? Who wins?
The Chad wins.

105
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:07,311
You cut through the fucking... You went the complete
wrong way. That's not even the course bro.

106
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:12,395
We gotta to have a complete rematch.
There's no fucking way that that is gonna be the result.

107
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:40,069
Oh whoa, careful kids. God's watching.

108
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,119
Okay, while we're here are we gonna
play or we're just gonna make out?

109
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,396
I vote play.
- Me too.

110
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,677
Alright dipshits, huddle up.
- Okay, everybody hold a hand.

111
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:55,233
Dude, this is so gayish.
- Oh, go back, wash mop head.

112
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,073
Okay, who's the ghost?
- Can I play?

113
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:04,759
You scared the crap out of me, little momma.
- I'd really like to play.

114
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:08,356
It's my favorite game.
- I bet it is, baby.

115
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:14,390
I know all the best hiding spots.
- That's what I'm talking about.

116
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:20,389
I don't know, it's kinda weird.
- You got it bro, girls are so weird.

117
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,553
Come on, let her play.
You might get lucky, Eli.

118
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:31,553
Oh come on Eli, I'll protect you.
- You're in.

119
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,432
Come here.

120
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,032
Alright, spread it out.
- Wait, wait. What are the rules again?

121
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:44,910
One person's the ghost. Everybody else hides,
once you're caught you turn into a ghost.

122
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,674
Last one alive wins.

123
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:52,311
Alright, who's the ghost?
- I am. I am the ghost.

124
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,596
Okay, come on.
- Here we go.

125
00:14:54,760 --> 00:15:00,596
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
release the one ignored by heaven.

126
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:05,709
eight, nine, ten, now run and hide
or join her at the devil's side.

127
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:10,556
eleven comes, the clock will chime
forgotten souls erased by time.

128
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,475
midnight comes, it's not too late
so kill the ghost or seal your fate!

129
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,838
Midnight.

130
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,710
Layla's a ghost.

131
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,275
Lex is a ghost.

132
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,870
Chad's a ghost.

133
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,717
And Mitchell's sacked and lost.

134
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,318
This is so stupid.

135
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,992
Hannah's a ghost.
Fucking ghost, yeah.

136
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,438
Sandy's a ghost.
- You go that way. We'll get her.

137
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:42,670
You're the only one left. You won.

138
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:50,316
What are you doing?
- Do you remember me?

139
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,676
Do you remember me?

140
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,672
Hey, be careful.

141
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,475
You will.

142
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,198
Hey, where did she go?

143
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,237
Sandy, what happened?

144
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:33,197
The girl just jumped.
- What happened?

145
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,399
What happened?
- The girl she just jumped off the cliff.

146
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:46,312
We've been over every inch ground
down there and I'm telling you there's no girl.

147
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,031
It's gotta be something.
People are just disappearing.

148
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:56,513
I hate to say this boss but,
maybe she's just making it up.

149
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,310
I think I'm gonna be sick.

150
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,552
Everything okay, daddy?
- Yeah, baby.

151
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:14,558
Look, ah, there's nothing down there.
- Wait, wait, but Sandy saw her jumped.

152
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,953
I know, I know. That's why we're here,
that's why we're gonna stay here until I make sure everybody's safe.

153
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:23,271
So what do we do?
- Keep looking for her.

154
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:28,150
You, you take her home.
Don't worry, if she's here, we're gonna find her.

155
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,834
She's dead, isn't she?
- Sandy, nobody's dead.

156
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,516
I saw her jumped.
- Maybe she's hiding.

157
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:44,832
Maybe planning a joke or something.
- Dude, why don't we just get home?

158
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,232
There's nothing we can do tonight, you guys.
Let's call it a night.

159
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,549
Are you okay?

160
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,597
I know what I saw.

161
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:07,310
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
release the one ignored by heaven.

162
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:11,314
eight, nine, ten, now run and hide
or join her at the devil's side.

163
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,756
eleven comes, the clock will chime
forgotten souls erased by time

164
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:19,710
midnight comes, it's not too late
so kill the ghost or seal your fate!

165
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:08,795
Sister Dolores says
it's my magic breath.

166
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,988
That's a pretty flower.
- They're called forget-me-nots.

167
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,790
You put them over the graves.

168
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:21,396
How come?
- So you don't forget the dead.

169
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,678
But I don't know any dead people.

170
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,231
I do.

171
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,392
Oh, sad.
- That's okay.

172
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:41,033
Sister Dolores says that if my faith is strong
enough, I can have all the friends I want.

173
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,075
But I only want you.

174
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,795
Bestfriends?

175
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,676
Friends forever.

176
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,596
Good morning.

177
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,954
We should leave.
- Do we have to?

178
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:36,078
Stop it.
- Doesn't feel like you want me to stop.

179
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,398
What's wrong with you? Are you okay, baby?

180
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,393
I wished we break up.

181
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:10,995
What? Why?
- I'm over it.

182
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,635
Why did I not do it right?

183
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,350
I'm just not feeling it.

184
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29,674
It's Hannah, isn't it?
I knew it, I know you're into her.

185
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,559
Look, I just don't wanna be
tied down to anybody.

186
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,272
Don't you fucking dare.

187
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:48,838
Fine. It's yours.
Swim for it.

188
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,110
Are you okay?

189
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,758
Wait.

190
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,560
Do you have anything smaller?
- Here.

191
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,918
Perfect. Let Chad see what he's missing.

192
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:25,153
Wait, I thought you were over him.
- I am. - So what happened?

193
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:30,235
Let's just say, I wasn't wearing panties at the party.
- Hannah, you didn't.

194
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,632
Oh, I most definitely did.
- What about Layla?

195
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,553
Who?
- If she finds out, it's gonna be major drama.

196
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,518
Hold on. Chad is seeing someone else?

197
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:48,119
What a dick. Of course, if it wasn't for his massive...

198
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,070
It's kinda hot .

199
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:59,118
Hey, take it easy with my brother, okay. He likes you.
- Really?

200
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:06,312
I didn't see anything. Not that there's
anything to see, of course, there's something to see.
There's a lot to see.

201
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:11,474
I just, I didn't, I didn't see it.
- Turn around, goofball.

202
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,271
Will this make me look like a slut?

203
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,355
You look...

204
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,679
pretty.

205
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:35,756
Don't you have something to pack?
- No, actually I'm good to go.

206
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,070
Eli, go pack again.

207
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:55,189
Got you
- You got me, Pete.

208
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,909
You always get me, man.
- That's 'coz you smoke too much.

209
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:03,551
You know, you better lay off that shit if you wanna
make babies with that lovely little woman here.

210
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,917
Do you got something for me?
- I sure do.

211
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,798
Absolutely.

212
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,672
How about that? Ain't that a beaut?

213
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,671
All of the check, huh.

214
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:28,389
What the hell if she's worth it, right.
- Don't come calling me Monday saying you're hangover now.

215
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:33,111
Hangover? I'd probably still be drunk.
- Oh shit, wait a minute? Do me a favor, will you?

216
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:37,114
Check one, two and three
the safety guards.

217
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,919
Where can I put these?
- Hey, you guys.

218
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,389
What's up?
- Hey, Cecilia.

219
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:56,711
What's up with the stripes?
- I have to work.

220
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,555
Are you serious?
- Yeah, I know it sucks, I need to get rid of my tan lines.

221
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,790
Sure, you do.

222
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,279
Unbelievable.

223
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,957
Have you no shame?
- Of course not, you know that.

224
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,792
Where is Layla?

225
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,996
Hi, Jake.
- Hey, CC.

226
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:27,711
How is it? You'll have a drink from me, okay.
- Yes, ma'am. I'll have two.

227
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:31,714
TJ's gonna be here at seven,
the beer's gonna be chilled on ice.

228
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,754
Don't mind if I do.

229
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,909
Hey, Suzie Q. You missed me?

230
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,192
You want some?

231
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,272
Sweet.

232
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,592
You're good.

233
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,830
What up, sweet Melissa? Looking sexy.

234
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,355
You're so in shape baby, huh?

235
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:03,508
Mary Jane, we meet again?

236
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,918
What's up, baby?
Feeling a little tight today, huh.

237
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,036
You need a little lube?

238
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,270
Is that you, Pete?

239
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:41,632
Note to self:
Drugs are bad.

240
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:49,108
Out here to scream, baby.

241
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,472
Hey, who is there?

242
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,800
Don't make me kick your ass, man.

243
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,475
Are you okay?

244
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:20,760
First thing I wanna do when we get there,
is take a long nap in the sand.

245
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:27,678
Think back with Pina Colada
just forget about everything for a while.

246
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,957
If you need company let me know...

247
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,230
We forgot about the beer.

248
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,633
Wait, isn't TJ bringing the beer?

249
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,756
Who?
- TJ.

250
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,791
I'll call him.

251
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:54,199
What's with her?
- I don't know.

252
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:57,079
She's been acting weird all day.

253
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,832
Who wants some?

254
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:17,400
Come on, I'll not let them right here.
- I mean, what a lovely day to go to the beach.

255
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:21,109
Hey, any word?
- No, nothing.

256
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:24,397
But don't worry I gonna sort the whole
mess out when you guys are gone.

257
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:28,235
Well, if you find her, will you call me?
- When I find her, you will be the first person I'll call.

258
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,913
Thanks, Zack.

259
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:33,197
Alright, you kids have fun.
- We always do.

260
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:37,399
Well, not too much fun okay.  And for Christ's
sake, keep a leash on my daughter, will you?

261
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,198
Only if it's leather.

262
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:51,270
Sure you can't come?
- Miss me okay.

263
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,750
Hey, let's see what you got?

264
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:15,953
Oh Eli-e, let us see what you got.
- Loser buys beer.

265
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:19,396
Come on, Eli. Don't be a pussy.
Be a tiger.

266
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:25,270
Please, Jake. Not now.
- I'm not a tiger.

267
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,192
I'm a pirate.

268
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:46,153
Where is he?
- Wait, wait, wait, where is he?

269
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,436
You're winning.

270
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,676
Watch out.

271
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,636
No way.

272
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:42,312
Oh shit, I always had you.

273
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:46,033
Yeah well, now you
have beer to go.

274
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,076
Sandy?
- What the hell?

275
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:54,276
This is our game.
- This is my friend. Jake.

276
00:36:55,480 --> 00:37:00,508
This is our game.
- I was gonna get you, I just forgot.

277
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:06,871
What are they doing here?
- It's okay, they're cool. They're my friends.

278
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,429
You're ruining this.

279
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,953
What's wrong with her?

280
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,789
It's nothing. She's cool.
- Come on, guys. Let's go.

281
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:34,915
Hey Sandy, you coming or what?
- Sandy, are you okay?

282
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,272
Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

283
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,317
It's fun, huh?

284
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,353
What's wrong?
- A new clerk.

285
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:01,593
Hannah, you have an advantage here.
Two rounds.

286
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:06,390
No way, they always card me.
- Don't look at me, I can't even grow a mustache.

287
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:09,028
Oh you can't even grow a pube, Eli.

288
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,350
What's going on?
- Strategy.

289
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:16,469
I told you that we should wait for TJ.
- Guys, I got this under control.

290
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:20,553
Wait, no no wait...  -- Yeah, she is.
- She isn't gonna...

291
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,438
Can I help you?
- I sure hope so.

292
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:31,718
You have something hot for me?
- We have hotdogs.

293
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,279
I'm starving.

294
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:38,513
How much?
- $1.50 for the regular, $2 for the footlong.

295
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,752
I'll take the biggest one you got.

296
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:50,554
Forgot my wallet. See.
- I guess, I can lend you some change.

297
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:55,077
Well, aren't you sweet?
Wait, let me help you.

298
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:58,710
What are you doing?
- What's this?

299
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,313
Oh my...

300
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,075
Holy shit, she's gonna screw that dude.
- So what? He's hot.

301
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:47,349
I don't need to see that.
- Wait, is nobody bothered by this?

302
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:53,794
Why would this bother us?
She's getting naked.

303
00:39:55,560 --> 00:40:01,317
How can she do this to TJ?
- What's with you? You're talking crazy.

304
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,833
Me?

305
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,512
Who the hell is TJ?

306
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,998
Is somebody out there?

307
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,191
Screw this.

308
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:01,711
You, dude, hadn't come up yet.
Let's go.

309
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:09,116
Are you okay, man?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

310
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:13,910
Alright. Move your ass right at the market.
- Sure, I'm there.

311
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:11,111
Somebody fucking help me.

312
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,152
Are you ready?

313
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:38,512
Where is your bike?
- I left it at the house, remember?

314
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:43,118
Come on, get in.

315
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:51,314
Oh my God, just hit me.
We're done, we're graduating.

316
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:55,951
I'm graduating.
I'm graduating.

317
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:57,473
Dude, that was awesome.
- That was awesome.

318
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:04,674
Get back in the car. What the hell is going on?
- What do you mean?

319
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:07,673
Yeah, Sandy, what're you talking about?
- Where's my stuff?

320
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:10,479
I mean, where are the beach chairs?
Where's your bogey board?

321
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:16,756
Why would you bring a freaking bogey board to the mountains?
- I have nothing to say to you.

322
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:20,230
Excuse me?
- How about TJ?

323
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:25,997
Who the heck is TJ?
- I don't wanna be with anybody else.

324
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:29,755
Not now. Not ever. You're thrash.
- Fuck you, Sandy.

325
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:33,993
Just because you're Cin"the fucking"rella doesn't
give you the right to judge the rest of us.

326
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:37,914
Do me a favor, Lex and shut the fuck up.
- Jesus, Jake, wake up!

327
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:42,392
You think it's just me? She thinks you're thrash too,
she thinks our whole family's garbage.

328
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:45,950
Stop the car.

329
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:56,228
Sandy, what the hell is going on? You're acting like a lunatic.
- You know, this is Chad's car.

330
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,557
Who's Chad?

331
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:08,115
Pretty boy asshole. The guy who drives this car.
Oh yeah, you fucked him yesterday, how about that?

332
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:12,319
Sandy, come on. You're freaking me out, alright.
- She's out of her goddamn mind.

333
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,072
Shut up.

334
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,038
Sandy, what the fuck is going on?

335
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:22,558
What is this, Jake? Is this some kind of joke.
- I don't know, Sandy. You tell me.

336
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,917
Whatever it is, it's not very funny.

337
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:28,753
Get in the car.

338
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:34,438
No, wait. Dad said that I wasn't gonna let you drive.
- Eli, get in the goddamn car.

339
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:56,636
This can't be possible.
- Wait, Sandy.

340
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:27,592
Eli, stay here.
- Wait, maybe I should go...

341
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:30,115
I said, stay here!

342
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:45,079
Can you like turn the
music or something?

343
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:48,949
What's wrong with her?
- She's fucked up.

344
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:54,638
What are you talking about? Sandy's the smartest girl I know.
She's class president. She's going to Stanford.

345
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:59,554
Well, the more perfect someone life's seems
the more fucked up they probably are.

346
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:04,999
I don't know what that makes you, Mother Teresa?
- Nope, just honest.

347
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:09,119
Well, at least I can figure out
what I'm worth to fucking fuck first.

348
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:13,718
You're a bitch, Lex.

349
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:19,119
What the fuck do you mean?
- Jesus, Hannah, chill out.

350
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:04,398
Guys?

351
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:16,200
It was like he was never here.

352
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:55,277
Oh my God, Eli. What happened?
What are you doing?

353
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:06,436
Dude, I didn't mean it.

354
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:28,951
Oh shit.
- Where's Lex?

355
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:08,151
Alexis?

356
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,351
Help me.

357
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:23,911
Where are you?

358
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:37,597
Where are you?

359
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:39,354
I'm gonna need a shovel.
To dig with anything.

360
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:45,991
Sandy, are you hurt or what? What happened?
- She was right here, I swear. She was right here.

361
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:48,549
Don't just stare there, help me.
- Stop it. Stop it.

362
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:51,790
This can't be happening.
- Jake, what is going on?

363
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:56,829
I swear, she was right here.
- Stop, stop. You're not making any sense.

364
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:01,551
She was right there.
You saw it, didn't you?

365
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:06,635
You were right here.
Eli, you saw it, didn't you?

366
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:11,191
Saw what?
- That thing, that fucking thing who
dragged her to the goddamn ground.

367
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:13,430
Dragged who?
- Lex.

368
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:19,793
How can you not remember them?
Don't look at me like that.

369
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:22,793
I'm not crazy.

370
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:39,795
I don't wanna do this.
- Jake, you were dumber than I thought you were.

371
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:48,394
What the fuck do you want?
- Nothing, sir.

372
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:53,235
Nothing. Get the fuck out of my office
- But, I...

373
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:56,597
Sandy's just worried
about that girl.

374
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:01,871
And I told you I'd call.
- Zack, you don't understand.

375
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:03,439
Shut up.

376
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:14,436
Her name is Angela Smith.

377
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:19,149
See, I told you I'd call.

378
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:28,390
I've been talking to the school but the girl she was
looking for, yeah she dropped down, the seventh grade.

379
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:33,236
This was some fucking nuns out there at the old convent.
Which if memory serves it right next to your graveyard.

380
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:36,756
Case closed.
- What do you mean, case closed?

381
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:42,870
I mean, the goddamn case is closed.
- People are disappearing.

382
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:45,713
Jake, let's just get out of here.
- People are dying.

383
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:48,348
Sandy, come on please. Let's just go.
- You have to believe me.

384
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:52,832
Is she on drugs? She's on fucking drugs, isn't she?
- Nobody's on drugs, this was a bad idea. Let's go

385
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,673
Hey, get back here.

386
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:02,120
Where are you going now?
- We have to hurry.

387
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:05,158
And go where?
- You heard, she lives at the convent.

388
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:09,871
Yeah, not exactly what I had in mind for a Saturday night, see ya.
- You can't leave we have to stay together.

389
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:14,158
And do what? Breaking to
a freaking convent? No, thanks.

390
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:19,599
Are you trying to get arrested? Coz then, we should just go back inside.
- We have bigger problems than being arrested.

391
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:24,231
Yeah, you got that right.
- I'm talking about Angela Smith, okay.

392
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:27,915
That's it. I'm going home, bye.
- You're gonna die.

393
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:33,393
It's not cool.

394
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:48,149
Which is it, Sandy? You wanna help with the time
or you're gonna act like a crazy person? Coz I'm not going.

395
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:51,630
Please, Hannah. I'm begging you.

396
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:58,271
Maybe we should just go home.
- Can't do that.

397
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:01,955
Coz this asshole is gonna
be there waiting for me.

398
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:07,194
What about our house?
- Right. With her like this?

399
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:13,799
Who's gonna get the blame for that?
Not you, guys.

400
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:17,919
Jake, you don't understand.
- I don't understand? I don't understand what's going on.

401
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:21,311
I don't understand what you want from me?

402
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:25,155
or what the hell is going on
with this convent or this goddamn girl?

403
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:28,395
I don't understand any of it.

404
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:40,517
But if it's that important to you...

405
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:43,639
I'll go.

406
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:47,640
We'll all go.

407
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:53,158
Not tonight.
But tomorrow morning.

408
00:57:55,720 --> 00:58:00,077
We have to stay together, then.
- Then we'll stay together.

409
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:01,912
All of us.

410
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:21,471
Anybody out there?

411
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:24,871
Now, coz if there is...

412
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:31,076
I'm ready, I'll take him.

413
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:38,073
But seriously, though.
Whatever it is, I got your back.

414
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:40,037
You know what I mean?

415
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:43,230
Do you believe me, Eli?

416
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:52,239
I believe that you believed it.
And that's good enough for me.

417
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:58,553
I didn't really wanna go to the mountains, anyway.
- I did.

418
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:03,434
Actually, I was really looking forward to it.

419
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:08,878
Really? Eli?
Want no dirtbags around?

420
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:12,077
Oh Jake, just you.

421
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:13,992
And your ticket.

422
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:20,076
Here, give this to Sandy.
- I don't know, Hannah?

423
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:23,630
Oh, come on. She needs to sleep.

424
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:32,438
Come here a second.

425
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:45,554
Not exactly how we planned to
spend the night, is it?

426
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:54,837
You remember last fall when the scouts
were all over me and I was just out of my mind.

427
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:58,638
I thought I was going crazy.

428
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:04,830
But the night before state you showed up
with all the wine and blankets and what did we do?

429
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:11,112
We laid up in the roof and...
- fell asleep watching the stars.

430
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:16,400
You showed me the best thing I could do
was just forget about everything.

431
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:21,911
You were right.
- You lost the game, Jake.

432
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:25,038
But I played great.

433
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:30,792
Is it me?

434
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:34,835
Did I do something wrong?

435
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:45,309
I know I'm not what
your parents want.

436
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:50,236
But I need to know
if I'm what you want.

437
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:55,550
You are what I want, Jake.
I love you.

438
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:59,432
I love you too.

439
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:18,870
She's really out.

440
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:25,633
My God. Who needs beer?
- Me.

441
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:30,910
I'm gonna check out the pool.
Eli?

442
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:37,872
Oh come on, walk me. Make sure I'm safe.

443
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:43,433
I mean, we're all suppose to stay together.
- I can handle her. It's okay.

444
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:45,079
Are you sure?

445
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:49,277
Absolutely.

446
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:54,670
Okay, just a sec.

447
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:13,236
I'm sure you know what you're doing .
- Doing, doing. What do you mean?

448
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:17,434
Someone showed me this once.

449
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:23,630
What are you doing?

450
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:25,597
Is that a vagina?

451
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:32,950
Consider this...

452
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:37,994
the keys to the kingdom.

453
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:42,870
Looks like a treasure map.
- Well, sailor.

454
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:47,636
You follow the arrows,
the glorious bounty awaits.

455
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:53,790
That'll work?
-Only one way to find out.

456
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:56,919
Ready?

457
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:00,716
He's ready.

458
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:28,636
It's cold.
- That's coz you're all the way over there.

459
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:33,839
What if she's right?

460
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:40,109
What if we're on some kind of
physical or metaphysical danger?

461
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:45,111
Then we don't have any time to waste.

462
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:50,914
I'm serious.
- So am I.

463
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:55,149
I'm gonna move a little bit closer, okay.

464
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:02,631
How come you never
asked me out, Eli?

465
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:07,279
You always have a boyfriend.

466
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:11,236
I would've said yes.

467
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:16,679
You seem to always be with a
guy that look different from me.

468
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,911
Can you forgive me?

469
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:30,999
I forgive you.

470
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:47,792
It's gonna be awesome, man.
- Here, put this in your pocket.

471
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:51,270
And don't let her see it.
- What's wrong?

472
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:55,069
Maybe she's a big loser like her friend.
- I'm not a loser.

473
01:04:55,240 --> 01:05:00,234
Sandy, I don't feel so good.
- Come on, Sandy. This was your idea.

474
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:04,757
Yeah, I mean, what's the big deal?
- We're gonna be late for dinner.

475
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:08,708
Yeah, whuzz.
- Everybody shut up. We're doing this, got it.

476
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:13,996
Give me the paint.

477
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:27,997
Easy, easy.

478
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:37,110
Where did you learn that?

479
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:40,670
Whatever "that" was.

480
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:46,638
A gentleman never tells..

481
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:51,271
Well, a gentleman could never do that either.

482
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:54,591
Where are you going?
- To get us some drinks.

483
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:57,877
Give you a chance to recharge.

484
01:05:58,040 --> 01:06:04,309
Let me guess. This is where you disappear
and leave me cold and alone.

485
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:06,914
Cold? Yes.

486
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:10,429
Alone? Not a chance.

487
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:13,478
Oh, just so you don't forget...

488
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:24,638
It's okay.

489
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:29,828
Jesus Christ, Sandy.

490
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:39,713
Sorry, you scared me.
- You see that sign?

491
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:43,919
You break your neck,
we're ain't accountable.

492
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:52,676
Oh, creep.

493
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:13,795
Eli, come here, help me up.
She's gonna hurt herself, hold her up.

494
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:23,240
Pull her legs.

495
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:29,953
I saw that mister.

496
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:37,119
I know you're there, asshole.

497
01:07:39,160 --> 01:07:41,469
Listen perv, don't make me call the...

498
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:57,590
This isn't real.

499
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:02,476
This isn't real.

500
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:06,914
Please, get away.

501
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:09,712
Please, get away.

502
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:48,230
There's my girl. I wasn't sure if
you wanted vodka or rhum.

503
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:50,356
Where is my brother?

504
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:05,396
Sandy, where the hell are you?
- Eli, are you okay?

505
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:08,916
No, look, mom and dad are all over me.
I can't cover for you anymore.

506
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:10,957
Is Hannah with you?

507
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:17,798
Meet me at the convent, okay.
- Sandy, just come home. Sheriff Mitchell stopped by the house.

508
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:20,190
Please meet me there.

509
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:32,631
I thought we're on a hurry.

510
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:03,432
May I help?
- Sorry to bother you...

511
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:07,070
I'm Sandy Channing and this is my friend...
- Jake Mitchell.

512
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:10,232
The quarterback?
- Yes ma'am.

513
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:16,077
Father Michael and I, we listen
to all the games on the Hi-Fi.

514
01:11:16,240 --> 01:11:20,028
I'm Sister Dolores. Please come in.

515
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:26,590
I'm sorry sister, I know it's late.
- What can I do for you?

516
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:29,399
We're here because of Angela Smith.

517
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:35,071
How do you know her?
- I used to know her when I was little.

518
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:38,630
Of course.
- Sister, Sandy is just concerned...

519
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:43,191
Is Angela her?
- Oh, I wish she was...

520
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:47,148
but it's just not practical,
I'm sure you understand.

521
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:51,233
Do you know where she might be?
- At St. Mary's hospital.

522
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:55,439
They're quite wonderful there.
- Is she hurt?

523
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:01,155
Angela is in coma.

524
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:07,109
Oh, I'm sorry.
I assumed you knew.

525
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:08,838
A coma?

526
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:15,719
Thank you for your time.
- Well, I could show you her room.

527
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:23,634
I've kept her room just as she's left it.

528
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:29,397
Her doctors say that her condition
is permanent but well one hopes...

529
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:35,111
Oh well, the girls' floor...
- Mr. Mitchell can wait down here on the boys' floor.

530
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:40,752
Can he come with me?
- I'll be fine. I'll stay here on the boys' floor.

531
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:43,633
Please, come in.
Come in. Come in.

532
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:56,073
Girls, girls, game time is over.
Ride along.

533
01:12:56,240 --> 01:12:59,994
Say your prayers.
I'll be there and I'll tuck you in a moment.

534
01:13:01,240 --> 01:13:04,596
A little rhyme I teach the children.

535
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:09,435
It helps to keep the nightmares at bay.

536
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:23,074
Do you believe in the devil, Mr. Mitchell?
- No, not really.

537
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:28,155
Well, spend some time with these
little monsters, you'll believe.

538
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:32,915
So this is Angela's room?

539
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:38,912
This is a week before
it happened.

540
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:42,436
Six years ago this June.

541
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:48,914
How was that possible?
- Oh, I ask the Lord that every day.

542
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:55,393
Doctors blamed genetics but I don't
know. She was small...

543
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:58,711
and weaker than
the other children.

544
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:03,431
But I had faith that
God would protect her.

545
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:12,552
Angela believed in her own
kind of protection.

546
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:18,910
An angel?
- Faith is all-powerful.

547
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:24,916
If one truly believes in something,
one will make it come true.

548
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:32,477
Of course, we have to be careful
what we choose to believe in.

549
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:37,870
Duty calls. Forgive me.
I'll be right back.

550
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:51,957
Hey, you play any football?
- Do I play football?

551
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:53,872
Toss here, kid.

552
01:14:55,360 --> 01:15:00,036
You see this arm? In Jefferson County,
it's worth more than your life.

553
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:05,598
Nice arm. For a girl.

554
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:08,471
Kid, hey kid.

555
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:35,357
You gotta be kidding me?

556
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:45,471
Hey kid, I've got your ball.

557
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:54,350
Speak, you little bastard.

558
01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:23,952
What are you doing?

559
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:30,389
Did you know about these?
- What are they?

560
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:33,120
Why would she draw these?

561
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:37,279
Those can't be Angela's.

562
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:50,957
Just in case.

563
01:16:57,080 --> 01:16:58,718
Hey kid, is that you?

564
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:05,599
What is this thing?
- I don't know.

565
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:08,712
Whatever it is...

566
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:12,038
it's real.

567
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:07,429
What in God's name?

568
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:13,477
Who are you?

569
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:23,915
He's gone.

570
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:31,318
What happened? Are you okay?
- It's too late. It's too late.

571
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:35,358
Look at this.
- I don't understand. What's going on?

572
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:39,195
It is the ghost.
- Ghost? What ghost?

573
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:42,511
From the game.
- Who are you?

574
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:46,309
You're not Angela's friend.
What do you want from her?

575
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:49,517
She's suffered enough.
- You get out of here.

576
01:19:49,680 --> 01:19:53,150
Leave the poor girl in peace.
- God sees you, Ms. Channing.

577
01:19:53,320 --> 01:19:55,754
God sees everything.

578
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:09,073
Who was that lady? And what the hell were you doing
out here in the middle of the freaking night?

579
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:14,193
It doesn't matter anymore.
They're all gone, it's over.

580
01:20:14,360 --> 01:20:18,353
Sandy, nobody knows where you've been.

581
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:24,034
If you're in some kind of trouble,
you can talk to me.

582
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:28,876
It doesn't matter anymore, Eli. It doesn't matter.
- Stop saying that.

583
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:36,153
It matters to me.

584
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:41,318
You're my sister, okay.
If something is going on, please tell me.

585
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:43,436
So I can help you.

586
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:46,677
You can trust me.

587
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:52,232
You know that, right?
- I want you to listen to me, okay.

588
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:56,791
You do know that I love you and
I would never lie to you ever.

589
01:20:56,960 --> 01:21:01,397
But what I'm about tell you is gonna sound
like the craziest thing in the world, because it is.

590
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:05,553
And I know you're not gonna believe me, because
nobody believes me. But I need you to believe, Eli.

591
01:21:05,720 --> 01:21:07,199
I'm listening.

592
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:12,835
When we're little, we used to
play games, you remember?

593
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:17,596
In the graveyard?
- There was a girl, an orphan. Her name was Angela.

594
01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:25,998
Last night we played the game again, but we
weren't alone. Six people are with us, Eli.

595
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:32,235
Six of our friends, and I know you don't remember them,
but they were there and now they're gone.

596
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:37,353
Gone? What do you mean gone?
- Something...

597
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:40,273
This thing took them.

598
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:47,313
This thing is connected to
Angela and the game?

599
01:21:47,480 --> 01:21:49,357
It has to be.

600
01:22:04,760 --> 01:22:09,311
I knew you wouldn't believe me.
- I believe you.

601
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:16,875
I believe you.
Why would you make it up?

602
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:19,190
I wouldn't.

603
01:22:43,640 --> 01:22:49,431
Let's figure this out. The game.
What are the rules of the game?

604
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:54,799
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
- Release the one ignored by heaven.

605
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:57,076
That's Angela, right?

606
01:22:57,240 --> 01:23:01,836
eight, nine, ten, now run and hide
or join her at the devil's side.

607
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,673
That's obvious.

608
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:09,994
eleven comes, the clock will chime
forgotten souls erased by time.

609
01:23:12,440 --> 01:23:17,912
That's it. Erased. Okay, that's it.
Erased by time. That makes sense now.

610
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:22,870
Okay, it doesn't make any sense at all,
but I think I know why.

611
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:30,393
People are gone.
People I knew?

612
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:35,395
You didn't just know them Eli they were your
best friends and now one by one they've been...

613
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:37,039
Erased.

614
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,150
Alright, so how does it end? Midnight comes...

615
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:48,359
It's not too late.
- So kill the ghost or seal your fate.

616
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:52,274
God, she's still alive. Angela's still alive.

617
01:23:52,440 --> 01:23:55,193
What does that mean?
- It means she has to die.

618
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:56,918
Who has to die?

619
01:23:58,280 --> 01:24:00,999
What's going on?
- Dad...

620
01:24:03,160 --> 01:24:07,631
We've been really worried about you.
- Step aside, son.

621
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:11,031
Wait.
- You're sick, honey.

622
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:15,113
She didn't do anything wrong.
- No, sweetheart. She just needs some help.

623
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:19,432
No, no. You're not going anywhere, alright. Sit down.
- Let go.

624
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:23,440
You don't understand, please.

625
01:24:28,680 --> 01:24:33,754
It's gonna be okay, honey.
- You'll get back to normal in no time.

626
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:36,593
We're gonna take very good
care of you, Ms. Channing.

627
01:24:36,760 --> 01:24:39,399
Sandy, I'm here. I'm right here.
- Step aside.

628
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:45,988
For Christ's sake. Somebody hold him down.
- Sandy, tell me what to do?

629
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:50,597
Kill the ghost or seal your fate.
- What is she saying?

630
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:53,877
Kill her?
- Kill her.

631
01:24:54,040 --> 01:24:55,393
You can't go any further.

632
01:24:57,400 --> 01:25:01,393
I'll do it, Sandy. I'll do it.

633
01:25:28,360 --> 01:25:30,032
Midnight.

634
01:25:32,440 --> 01:25:37,036
Stop. Let me go.
Let me go.

635
01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:45,674
Eli? Where is Eli?
- What is she saying?

636
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:49,037
Who's Eli, honey?
- Is Eli one of her friends?

637
01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:56,755
Sandy doesn't have any friends.
- Go to sleep, honey. We'll be here when you wake up.

638
01:25:58,440 --> 01:25:59,953
Angela Smith.

639
01:26:03,480 --> 01:26:07,473
That's strange.
Angela Smith is a patient here.

640
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:19,068
I thought we could play the game?

641
01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:23,028
Who's playing?
- Just us.

642
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:39,313
I'm sorry about last time.

643
01:26:41,200 --> 01:26:43,589
It's getting late. We should play.

644
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:57,189
Maybe we shouldn't play.
- No, I want to play.

645
01:26:57,360 --> 01:26:59,510
Wait. Who's the ghost?

646
01:27:01,320 --> 01:27:02,673
You are.

647
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:09,393
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
release the one ignored by heaven.

648
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:13,671
Run.

649
01:27:17,480 --> 01:27:19,550
Help me.

650
01:27:33,680 --> 01:27:35,432
Midnight.

651
01:27:53,560 --> 01:27:56,438
Look at that shit.

652
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:15,237
Who did this?

653
01:31:16,360 --> 01:31:18,590
I know what I've done...

654
01:31:24,640 --> 01:31:27,438
but I also know what you've done.

655
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:48,194
You wanna play a game?

656
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:56,352
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
release the one ignored by heaven.

657
01:33:56,520 --> 01:33:59,637
eight, nine, ten, now run and hide
or join her at the devil's side.

658
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:04,590
I remember you. I remember everything.
- Eleven comes, the clock will chime
forgotten souls erased by time.

659
01:34:04,760 --> 01:34:08,799
I'm so sorry.
- Midnight comes, it's not too late
so kill the ghost or seal your fate!

660
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:12,475
Please. I was your bestfriend.

661
01:34:16,200 --> 01:34:22,355
All I wanted was you.
- I'll never forget you. I promise.

662
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:36,638
Friends forever. Is that it?

663
01:35:01,600 --> 01:35:03,795
Well look at you.

664
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:07,158
It's a miracle.
