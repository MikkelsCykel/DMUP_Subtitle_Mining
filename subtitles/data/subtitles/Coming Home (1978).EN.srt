- Whoa, baby.
- You caught nothing.

2
00:00:36,289 --> 00:00:39,334
You're gonna have to move away.

- If Kenny's movin', you've got to move.
- You follow him, Bobby.

5
00:00:47,801 --> 00:00:50,804
Would you go
if you had the chance again?

6
00:00:50,929 --> 00:00:53,598
- Would I go? Yeah.
- You'd go to Canada?

7
00:00:53,723 --> 00:00:56,017
- No, not to Canada.
- You'd go back to 'Nam?

8
00:00:56,142 --> 00:00:58,186
- Yeah, because...
- You would?

9
00:00:58,311 --> 00:01:00,355
- You're a fucking psycho!
- No.

10
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,068
- You'd go back?
- Yeah. I went over for a purpose, man.

11
00:01:05,193 --> 00:01:08,154
- What was your purpose?
- A lot of it was curiosity.

12
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,075
- But another thing was...
- You can't be curious, man.

13
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:17,205
I said that was just part of the reason.
The other was a moral obligation.

14
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:24,629
I feel that anybody... Not for their country
or anything like that. For anybody.

15
00:01:24,754 --> 00:01:28,884
Nobody's got the right to tell anybody
what to do against their will.

16
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:31,553
That's what I went over to fight for.

17
00:01:31,678 --> 00:01:36,725
Did you know that they ran the French
out of there after 20 years?

18
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:42,355
Wait a minute. You said they're forcing...?
Shit! You call the draft not being forced?

19
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,524
I ain't sayin' the draft in our country.

20
00:01:44,649 --> 00:01:49,779
I'm talking about another country that's
having something forced upon them.

21
00:01:49,905 --> 00:01:55,493
- Is it our duty to fight for somebody else?
- If you believe in it! If you believe in it.

22
00:01:55,619 --> 00:02:01,666
I can't see anybody saying that,
after coming back, they would go again.

23
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:03,960
I just can't deal with that.

24
00:02:04,085 --> 00:02:09,049
Wait a minute. The reason I can see it
is that some of us, not all of us,

25
00:02:09,174 --> 00:02:14,137
some of us need to justify to ourselves
what the fuck we did there.

26
00:02:14,262 --> 00:02:19,518
If we come back and say what we did
was a waste, some of us can't live with it.

27
00:02:19,643 --> 00:02:23,063
- So they'd do it again?
- Man, they gotta keep...

28
00:02:23,188 --> 00:02:26,274
Inside they're lying to themselves
continuously saying

29
00:02:26,399 --> 00:02:30,820
"What I did was OK
because this is what I got from it, man."

30
00:02:30,946 --> 00:02:36,201
"I have to justify being paralysed, I have to
justify killing people, so I say it was OK."

31
00:02:36,326 --> 00:02:39,204
But how many guys
can make the reality and say

32
00:02:39,329 --> 00:02:43,708
"What I did was wrong
and all this other shit was wrong, man"

33
00:02:43,834 --> 00:02:48,296
and be able to live with themselves cos
they're crippled for the rest of their life?

00:24:43,445 --> 00:24:46,907
Can I kiss you? Can I sniff? Oh, man.

How are you doing?

306
00:25:07,552 --> 00:25:11,556
- Do you remember me?
- No.

307
00:25:11,681 --> 00:25:14,184
I was at Lincoln High
when you were there.

308
00:25:14,309 --> 00:25:19,272
Sally Hyde. Well, I was Sally Bender
when... when I was there.

309
00:25:21,274 --> 00:25:23,318
So?

310
00:25:27,822 --> 00:25:30,200
I just started volunteering today here.

311
00:25:30,325 --> 00:25:34,371
Terrific. If I could get my hands loose,
I'd salute you.

312
00:25:40,502 --> 00:25:42,546
You're a mess.

313
00:25:45,549 --> 00:25:48,134
- Sally Bender.
- Right.

314
00:25:49,928 --> 00:25:54,599
- You were a cheerleader.
- That's right. Three years.

315
00:26:00,355 --> 00:26:03,650
- Were you wounded in 'Nam?
- Right.

316
00:26:03,775 --> 00:26:06,486
When did it happen?

317
00:26:08,488 --> 00:26:10,532
A long time ago.

318
00:26:13,326 --> 00:26:17,873
- My husband just went over there.
- Poor bastard.

319
00:26:30,927 --> 00:26:32,971
Sally?

320
00:26:34,222 --> 00:26:37,851
Didn't we used to call you Bender Over?

321
00:26:37,976 --> 00:26:42,189
- What? Who said that?
- Bender Over. Everybody said it.

322
00:26:42,314 --> 00:26:45,317
- They did not!
- Yes, they did, Sally.

323
00:26:45,442 --> 00:26:49,196
Oh, come on. They did not.
What are you talking about?

324
00:26:49,321 --> 00:26:51,364
Oh, shit.

325
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:54,659
Sally, listen.
Can I ask you for a big favour?

326
00:26:54,784 --> 00:26:56,828
Sure.

327
00:26:56,953 --> 00:27:01,041
How about unhitching me
from these things?

328
00:27:02,334 --> 00:27:05,420
- No, I can't do that, Luke.
- Sure you can. It's easy.

329
00:27:05,545 --> 00:27:09,508
No, I'm sorry. The doctor
has to do that. I...

330
00:27:09,633 --> 00:27:13,053
Come on. Please? Please, Sally Bender.

331
00:27:18,141 --> 00:27:20,435
- Come on.
- What are you doing in here?

332
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:23,772
- I just was seeing...
- We'll tend to Mr Martin, Sally.

333
00:27:23,897 --> 00:27:26,691
- You're needed on the ward.
- OK.

334
00:27:28,443 --> 00:27:32,656
Hey, Bender.
You almost got yourself a gold star.

335
00:27:40,956 --> 00:27:43,208
Pee Wee, I can crawl again.

336
00:27:51,508 --> 00:27:53,552
Morning.

337
00:27:55,178 --> 00:28:00,892
I'm gonna be feeding you this morning.
I'm a new volunteer here.

338
00:28:01,017 --> 00:28:03,061
Huh?

339
00:28:06,106 --> 00:28:11,695
He ain't transistorised, honey.
You gotta plug him in for sound.

340
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,864
Plug you in? Oh.

341
00:28:18,952 --> 00:28:21,830
Is this... is this gonna hurt?

342
00:28:25,333 --> 00:28:27,544
There. Is that OK?

343
00:28:28,753 --> 00:28:32,174
- Thank you.
- OK. Would you like some food?

344
00:28:33,258 --> 00:28:36,094
Hey, there you go. Oh, my.

345
00:28:36,219 --> 00:28:38,263
- I'm sorry.
- That's OK.

346
00:28:38,388 --> 00:28:40,432
You want me to...? Here.

347
00:28:40,557 --> 00:28:42,601
Here. Here you go.

348
00:28:45,187 --> 00:28:48,064
It's all energy. You understand?

349
00:28:49,274 --> 00:28:52,736
You don't understand.
You give out energy, you get energy back.

350
00:28:52,861 --> 00:28:56,698
You see me smiling?
Can you dig them pearly whites?

351
00:28:56,823 --> 00:28:59,743
I smile my ass off now.

352
00:28:59,868 --> 00:29:03,997
Hell, sometimes I think
I'm the Good Humor Man.

353
00:29:04,122 --> 00:29:08,251
Everyone wants a piece of my action.
They think I'm one of the Beach Boys.

354
00:29:08,376 --> 00:29:12,839
- Hey, Sally. This is my brother, Bill.
- Hi, Bill.

355
00:29:14,841 --> 00:29:19,387
You see that? Me and her just had
a whole conversation in smile contact.

356
00:29:19,513 --> 00:29:23,808
- Vi, do you have a jumper cable?
- Sure. Bridges!

Watch. You watching?

358
00:29:30,232 --> 00:29:33,485
You two just did it. You smiled
"See what I have to put up with?"

359
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:35,654
And she smiled back "He's harmless."

360
00:29:35,779 --> 00:29:37,989
- Are you on uppers?
- I don't know.

361
00:29:38,114 --> 00:29:41,535
Come on, Bill.
How about a game of chess?

362
00:29:43,745 --> 00:29:47,374
My brother -
a miracle of modern medicine.

363
00:29:50,752 --> 00:29:55,841

Oh, it's got a great sound system.

372
00:30:29,416 --> 00:30:30,625
Hello.

373
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:34,671
- Why is this one so much less expensive?
- It's two years older.

374

"I'm so tired when I come home at night,
I just fall right asleep."

00:30:41,094 --> 00:30:43,930
"I know you didn't want me
to get a job..." Thanks.

376
00:30:44,055 --> 00:30:51,104
"...but this isn't really a job, since
I don't get paid. I hope you don't mind."

377
00:30:51,229 --> 00:30:56,151
Then there's sort of a sexy ending.
"Love, Sally."

- That's nice.
- Thanks.

379
00:31:01,323 --> 00:31:05,994
But you didn't tell him the house
you rented was on the beach.

380
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:07,996
I know.

381
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:12,751
And you didn't tell him
about the new car you bought.

382
00:31:12,876 --> 00:31:16,630
I figure I'm gonna save that
for when he gets home.

383
00:31:18,924 --> 00:31:22,761
- I got one from Dink this morning.
- Oh, yeah?

384
00:31:22,886 --> 00:31:27,974
All he said was "Got you another ear."
Poetic, huh?

385
00:31:29,267 --> 00:31:34,856
A captain? Shit, Bender. You didn't
go out and marry a fucking captain?

386
00:31:34,981 --> 00:31:38,318
That's right. Why? What were you?

387
00:31:38,443 --> 00:31:40,487
A sergeant.

388
00:31:40,612 --> 00:31:43,824
Sergeants have a lot
of responsibility, don't they?

389
00:31:43,949 --> 00:31:46,952
Yes. They sent me my stripes
on the hospital ship.

390
00:31:47,077 --> 00:31:50,080
My reward for getting so fucked up!

391
00:31:50,914 --> 00:31:54,334
Why are you so cynical about that, Luke?

392
00:31:55,794 --> 00:31:59,339
What are you doing here, Bender?
Why aren't you on a golf course?

393
00:31:59,464 --> 00:32:02,259
Doing something you're good at.

394
00:32:02,384 --> 00:32:04,427
I'm just trying to keep busy.

395
00:32:04,553 --> 00:32:07,013
Sure. Something
to talk about over martinis.

396
00:32:07,138 --> 00:32:10,433
How you're helping out the poor cripples.

397
00:32:12,644 --> 00:32:16,106
I don't think that
I deserve that, Luke - at all.

398
00:32:16,231 --> 00:32:21,194
Maybe you're getting ready for your
husband to come back in a body bag.

399

Luke.

402
00:32:39,921 --> 00:32:42,257
Stop! Stop and listen to me!

403
00:32:45,302 --> 00:32:47,679
What is the matter with you?

404
00:32:52,184 --> 00:32:54,895
Why do you have to be such a bastard?

the decency to ask you how you're doing.

"Can I do anything for you?"

410
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:29,137
I got a Purple Heart. I got it from a second
lieutenant that wasn't even in the war.

411

They don't tell you about
how to manage your finances.

412

Or going back into society. Half
the people still can't go back into society.

413

What about your sex life?
They don't tell you about that.

414

I went out the first time
and didn't know what to do.

happens if I have a bowel movement?

I get there and I don't know how to react.

not enough staff.

on what you're asking us for, Sally.

421
00:34:06,675 --> 00:34:12,138
It's what I said. We could do an article
in the paper, using these photographs,

interviewing some of the guys, maybe.

I didn't want candy in the house.

It was a choice between dealing with that
or dealing with this football game

452
00:36:38,994 --> 00:36:42,497
and they just said it's not our function.

453
00:36:42,622 --> 00:36:45,041
Maybe I'm naive.

454
00:36:46,585 --> 00:36:49,379
Naive? She wants to know if she's naive!

455
00:36:49,504 --> 00:36:52,215
- Oh, man. That's cold.
- I'm a cold man.

456
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:55,218
It's like you've done your duty,
served your purpose,

457
00:36:55,343 --> 00:36:59,014
so they just toss you into the heap
like a used Kleenex.

458
00:36:59,139 --> 00:37:01,183
That's the way it is. That's it.

459
00:37:01,308 --> 00:37:06,104
What is our function if it isn't to deal with
the problems you guys face every day?

460
00:37:06,229 --> 00:37:09,274
God! The smugness just...
I can't believe it.

461
00:37:09,399 --> 00:37:12,360
- Give 'em hell, Bender.
- Sorry.

462
00:37:12,486 --> 00:37:15,906
It's not gonna do any good,
but I'm rooting for you.

463
00:37:16,031 --> 00:37:18,825
Well, thanks a lot, Luke.

464
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:21,745
Seriously, if they put
something in the paper...

465
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:25,207
You're beautiful when you're excited.

466
00:37:28,084 --> 00:37:32,756
<i>Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit</i>

467
00:37:34,591 --> 00:37:37,594
<i>When we meet again</i>

468
00:37:37,719 --> 00:37:40,805
<i>Introduced as friends</i>

469
00:37:40,931 --> 00:37:46,603
<i>Please don't let on
that you knew me when</i>

470
00:37:46,728 --> 00:37:51,983
<i>I was hungry and it was your world</i>

471
00:37:52,108 --> 00:37:56,154
<i>Ah, you fake just like a woman...</i>

472
00:37:56,279 --> 00:38:00,534
God only knows
what he saw over there... or did.

473
00:38:02,828 --> 00:38:07,582
I don't understand it.
He was only in 'Nam for two weeks.

474
00:38:07,707 --> 00:38:10,752
I worry a lot about Dink too.

475
00:38:10,877 --> 00:38:15,048
He's so funny, you know?
So uncomplicated.

476
00:38:15,173 --> 00:38:17,759
He's more than just a roll in the sack.

477
00:38:19,594 --> 00:38:22,681
I just hope he doesn't get totalled.

478
00:38:27,727 --> 00:38:31,064
Whoo!

479
00:38:35,902 --> 00:38:37,946
I got it.

480
00:38:40,866 --> 00:38:44,161
- Bender!
- You got a chair!

481
00:38:44,286 --> 00:38:47,998
- You changed your hair!
- You like it?

482
00:38:48,123 --> 00:38:51,668
- Yeah. It's very nice.
- You're mobile.

483
00:38:51,793 --> 00:38:53,920
- I'll help you. Go ahead.
- Thanks, Luke.

484
00:38:54,045 --> 00:38:56,089
- Hi, Rick.
- Hey, Luke. How you doing?

485
00:38:56,214 --> 00:38:58,258
Congratulations.

486
00:39:11,271 --> 00:39:13,940
Would you like to come over for dinner?

487
00:39:14,065 --> 00:39:17,152
Wouldn't you like to
get out of here one night?

488
00:39:17,277 --> 00:39:19,321
I'm a good cook.

489
00:39:21,573 --> 00:39:23,617
OK?

Didn't you grab my chair?

<i>(whistle)</i>

500

Can't you morons kick a field goal?
Come on! Field goal!

501
00:40:46,116 --> 00:40:50,162
B-u-s-t! Bust 'em!

502
00:41:07,053 --> 00:41:11,391
And around about July 1st,
my pa's mind would start wandering.

503
00:41:11,516 --> 00:41:16,771
He wouldn't give a damn about the cattle,
and that got us kids pretty excited.

504
00:41:16,897 --> 00:41:19,858
At the park they'd have flags flying
and games of chance,

505
00:41:19,983 --> 00:41:22,527
kissing booths and wrestling matches.

506
00:41:22,652 --> 00:41:26,948
But let me tell you,
that day was always too long for me.

507
00:41:27,073 --> 00:41:31,203
When it got dark, the band
would play "The Star-Spangled Banner"

508
00:41:31,328 --> 00:41:33,371
and the fireworks would start up,

509
00:41:33,497 --> 00:41:38,001
and I'd start thinking how brave those
men were that fought in the Revolution.

510
00:41:38,126 --> 00:41:42,547
I'd dream about those men,
how they went to war for our freedom.

511
00:41:42,672 --> 00:41:45,550
I guess that's when I decided
to be a soldier,

512
00:41:45,675 --> 00:41:48,929
seeing the sky lit up with those rockets.

513
00:41:49,054 --> 00:41:51,097
I enlisted when I became of age.

514
00:41:51,223 --> 00:41:53,892
I served in Europe and World War Two

515
00:41:54,017 --> 00:41:57,562
and was involved in the liberation
of dozens of towns.

516
00:41:57,687 --> 00:42:01,691
As I passed through them,
as I saw the faces of the people,

517
00:42:01,817 --> 00:42:05,445
I realised I had fulfilled my dream.

518
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:10,617
I had become one of those men
who had gone to war for freedom.

519
00:42:10,742 --> 00:42:13,662
I sure wound up doing
what I wanted to do,

520
00:42:13,787 --> 00:42:17,415
and that's what July 4th means to me.

521
00:42:17,541 --> 00:42:19,584
<i>(some clapping)</i>

522
00:42:20,752 --> 00:42:22,796
<i>(squeaking)</i>

523
00:42:26,383 --> 00:42:30,053

524
00:42:30,178 --> 00:42:32,764
<i>(clicks tongue sharply)</i>

525
00:42:32,889 --> 00:42:35,684
- No.
- Go on, try it.

00:42:35,809 --> 00:42:37,853
<i>(clicks tongue softly)</i>

527
00:42:37,978 --> 00:42:40,021

528
00:42:40,146 --> 00:42:44,776
<i>(Vi) Hey, Billy the Kid. Let's show
these guys what real talent is. Come on.</i>

529
00:42:44,901 --> 00:42:48,864
Give me your arm. You know,
the duet we worked up last night.

530
00:42:48,989 --> 00:42:52,325
<i>(half-blowing, half-honking)</i>

531
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:57,831
<i>- Billy, you gonna play that thing?
- (Sally) Come on, Billy. Play your guitar.</i>

532
00:42:57,956 --> 00:43:01,501
<i>(Vi) Come on. I love
when you play the guitar.</i>

533
00:43:16,516 --> 00:43:21,938
What is tomorrow? What is it we need?

534
00:43:22,063 --> 00:43:24,941
What will it give us?

535
00:43:25,066 --> 00:43:27,444
A new life we can lead

536
00:43:27,569 --> 00:43:33,200
Will the wind crack the limbs
of a few dying trees?

537
00:43:36,703 --> 00:43:42,334
Will the branches unite
and bend in the breeze?

538
00:43:43,418 --> 00:43:48,089
Tomorrow is hope
for it is something I've not seen

539
00:43:49,216 --> 00:43:55,680
Tomorrow is a sunny day...
live in a sunny dream...

540
00:44:06,566 --> 00:44:09,653
Come on, Billy. That sounded great.

541
00:44:19,663 --> 00:44:21,706
Shit.

542
00:44:24,042 --> 00:44:27,170

Luke, are you OK?

00:45:16,469 --> 00:45:20,640
- Yeah.
- Should we do the dinner another night?

No. No.

<i>(Luke) Oh, boy.</i>

Just come down here
and hold the chair for me.

555
00:46:15,654 --> 00:46:17,823
Thanks.

556
00:46:27,749 --> 00:46:30,126
You could pick my ankles up.

Thank you. That's good. Thank you.

It's warm because I've had the oven on.

559

I've got one of those timing devices
that cooks your food while you're at work.

Whoo.

Let me just move you around a bit.

00:47:05,036 --> 00:47:08,165
I just happen to have some.

565
00:47:11,835 --> 00:47:14,129
Let me just...

566
00:47:17,924 --> 00:47:20,677
Do you get a chance to go out very much?

567
00:47:20,802 --> 00:47:24,431
- Do you go to people's homes?
- No, I don't.

568
00:47:30,687 --> 00:47:33,064
Let's go in the living room.

569

570

Let's see. Um...

571
00:47:56,171 --> 00:47:58,882
Wait a minute. What am I doing?

572
00:47:59,007 --> 00:48:02,511
- What?
- What am I lighting a fire for?

573
00:48:03,887 --> 00:48:05,972
It's the old Girl Scout instinct.

574
00:48:06,097 --> 00:48:08,141
Let's see. I've got a dip...

575
00:48:11,186 --> 00:48:13,980
Sit down, Bender.

576
00:48:14,105 --> 00:48:16,149
Sit down.

How about some music?

00:49:16,001 --> 00:49:18,044
Well...

588
00:49:19,129 --> 00:49:23,466
I don't think you're gonna
like my records very much.

589
00:49:23,592 --> 00:49:26,469
You probably won't
like the way I dance either.

590
00:49:26,595 --> 00:49:28,638
<i>(both chuckle)</i>

591
00:49:29,598 --> 00:49:32,559
Well...

592
00:49:34,853 --> 00:49:39,483
Do you know that when I dream,
I'm not in the chair?

593
00:49:39,608 --> 00:49:43,778
I don't even have a chair in my dream.
I have legs.

594
00:49:46,907 --> 00:49:51,828
When I was a kid, I used to jump
in my mother's kitchen

595
00:49:51,953 --> 00:49:54,498
and touch the ceiling.

596
00:49:54,623 --> 00:50:00,837
She used to get pissed off cos
I'd leave my handprints on the ceiling.

597
00:50:00,962 --> 00:50:04,841
I still check the snow reports,
the conditions at Mammoth.

598
00:50:04,966 --> 00:50:07,761
I'm still the same person, you know.

599
00:50:08,845 --> 00:50:12,224
It's funny.
When people look at me, they see...

600
00:50:12,349 --> 00:50:16,102
something else,
but they don't see who I am.

601
00:50:19,648 --> 00:50:24,110
I think people have a real hard time
seeing who other people really are.

602
00:50:24,236 --> 00:50:27,781
<i>People don't see me like I really am.</i>

603
00:50:27,906 --> 00:50:34,913
People look at me, I think, and they see
"Oh, cheery Sally, the captain's wife."

604
00:50:41,628 --> 00:50:46,675
Sometimes I feel like

01:53:22,514 --> 01:53:24,975
I just... I've been scared.

1215
01:53:30,647 --> 01:53:32,691
I love you.

1216
01:53:34,401 --> 01:53:36,444
I do.

1217
01:53:40,824 --> 01:53:45,704
I'm not going to make excuses
for what happened.

1218
01:53:45,829 --> 01:53:48,665
It happened.
I needed somebody. I was lonely.

1219
01:53:48,790 --> 01:53:51,042
- Don't bullshit me.
- It's not...

1220
01:53:51,168 --> 01:53:53,837
- Bob, I was lonely.
- Don't bullshit me.

1221
01:53:53,962 --> 01:53:56,131
- It's not bullshit.
- It's bullshit!

1222
01:53:56,256 --> 01:53:58,300
- Bob, please...
- It's bullshit!

1223
01:53:58,425 --> 01:54:01,052
Everybody needs somebody,
for Christ's sake!

1224
01:54:01,178 --> 01:54:03,847
If it's over with us, it's over!

1225
01:54:05,390 --> 01:54:07,851
You're saying
you won't even make the effort?

1226
01:54:07,976 --> 01:54:12,522
What I'm saying is...
I do not belong in this house!

1227
01:54:12,647 --> 01:54:16,443
- And they say I don't belong over there!
- Who's "they"?

1228
01:54:16,568 --> 01:54:19,946
The people that make the decisions
about the fucking war!

1229
01:54:20,071 --> 01:54:24,534
- Bob, I don't wanna talk about the war.
- What, then? The fucking marriage?

1230
01:54:24,659 --> 01:54:26,119
Think about that.

1231
01:54:26,244 --> 01:54:28,872
I can't talk to you
when you're shouting at me.

1232
01:54:28,997 --> 01:54:34,377
I wanna be your husband.
I just don't deserve to be your husband.

1233
01:54:35,670 --> 01:54:38,340
I don't deserve the fucking medal either.

1234
01:54:38,465 --> 01:54:42,093
How can they give you a medal for a war
they don't even want you to fight?

1235
01:54:42,219 --> 01:54:44,471
- Who is that?
- Bob? Sally? Can I talk to you?

1236
01:54:44,596 --> 01:54:50,977
- It's Luke. Let me tell him to go away.
- Wait a minute. You just wait right there.

1237
01:55:09,788 --> 01:55:14,126
I don't wanna make anything
more complicated than it already is.

1238
01:55:15,877 --> 01:55:21,466
I just thought there might be a few things
that... we should talk about.

1239
01:55:21,591 --> 01:55:25,303
Well, they're not very complicated.

1240
01:55:25,428 --> 01:55:27,806
It's actually very simple.

1241
01:55:33,562 --> 01:55:37,524
- I don't belong here.
- You belong here.

1242
01:55:38,775 --> 01:55:43,822
I just wanted to get things straight,
what's going on with me,

1243
01:55:43,947 --> 01:55:46,616
so you know where I'm coming from
and what happened.

1244
01:55:46,741 --> 01:55:49,578
I know where you're coming from.

1245
01:55:51,204 --> 01:55:53,373
And I know what happened.

1246
01:55:55,333 --> 01:55:59,546
I've just gotta figure out for myself

1247
01:56:00,714 --> 01:56:04,342
what happened
and how I'm gonna deal with it.

1248
01:56:04,468 --> 01:56:06,511
- I can understand that.
- Bullshit!

1249
01:56:06,636 --> 01:56:08,680
- Don't.
- You jodie fuck!

1250
01:56:08,805 --> 01:56:11,600
You get back! Get back, slope cunt!

1251
01:56:15,312 --> 01:56:21,401
Now you, jodie motherfucker, explain
to me how it is you understand anything.

1252
01:56:21,526 --> 01:56:26,323
I understand because I'm a brother and
I've been in the same place you're at now.

1253
01:56:26,448 --> 01:56:29,868
That's why I feel bad that I made it
harder for you than it already is.

1254
01:56:29,993 --> 01:56:32,037
That's bullshit.

1255
01:56:33,747 --> 01:56:37,459
She's here because she loves you.
There was never any question of that.

1256
01:56:37,584 --> 01:56:41,046
- Don't tell me that, goddamnit!
- It's true, Bob.

1257
01:56:41,171 --> 01:56:44,090
Bullshit! Bullshit!

1258
01:56:44,216 --> 01:56:47,719
If you give her a chance,
she can help you.

1259
01:56:49,763 --> 01:56:53,892
She wants to listen to you
and she wants to understand you.

1260
01:56:54,017 --> 01:56:56,353
Say something else, fuck.

1261
01:56:58,814 --> 01:57:01,566
Say something else, fuck.

1262
01:57:06,696 --> 01:57:09,282
I'm not the enemy.

1263
01:57:11,368 --> 01:57:15,163
Maybe the enemy is the fucking war.

1264
01:57:17,415 --> 01:57:23,797
But you don't want to kill anybody here.
You have enough ghosts to carry around.

1265
01:57:36,351 --> 01:57:38,812
Look at me. I'm...

1266
01:57:40,856 --> 01:57:42,899
My hand.

1267
01:57:48,780 --> 01:57:50,824
I was shaking.

1268
01:57:53,076 --> 01:57:55,120
I'm sorry.

1269
01:57:58,498 --> 01:58:00,584
I'm fucked.

1270
01:58:01,334 --> 01:58:03,378
<i>(sighs)</i>

1271
01:58:32,991 --> 01:58:37,370
I just wanna be a hero. That's all.

1272
01:58:40,373 --> 01:58:43,001
I just wanna be a fucking hero.

1273
01:58:44,544 --> 01:58:49,883
One day in my life, one moment,
I wanna go out a hero.

1274
01:58:52,052 --> 01:58:58,517
That way I would have done something
that was mine, that I've done.

1275
01:59:33,635 --> 01:59:36,388
Enemy forces had captured
the north side of the bridge

1276
01:59:36,513 --> 01:59:40,016
when Lieutenant Roscoe
charged forward firing his rifle.

1277
01:59:40,142 --> 01:59:44,020
Lieutenant Roscoe's actions
so unnerved the enemy, they withdrew,

1278
01:59:44,146 --> 01:59:47,065
allowing the lieutenant
to secure the enemy position

1279
01:59:47,190 --> 01:59:51,319
until the rest of his company could move
forward and consolidate their forces.

1280
01:59:51,444 --> 01:59:55,240
Lieutenant Roscoe maintained
the position against repeated attacks

1281
01:59:55,365 --> 01:59:57,993
and, though wounded,
continued to inspire his men

1282
01:59:58,118 --> 02:00:00,787
until reinforcements arrived
the following day.

1283
02:00:00,912 --> 02:00:05,041
Lieutenant Roscoe has upheld the highest
traditions of the Marine Corps

1284
02:00:05,167 --> 02:00:07,586
and of the United States naval service.

1285
02:00:07,711 --> 02:00:13,967
The Marine Corps builds body,
mind and spirit. Thank you.

1286

<i>(applause)</i>

1287
02:00:18,472 --> 02:00:22,350
And now, with a different perspective,
we have Luke Martin,

1288
02:00:22,476 --> 02:00:25,562
combat veteran of the Marine Corps.

1289
02:00:43,747 --> 02:00:47,959
- Sergeant, mind if I ask you a question?
- No, sir.

1290
02:00:49,169 --> 02:00:52,672
Just call me Sergeant - that's what I was.

1291
02:00:53,757 --> 02:00:55,926
- Where were you stationed?
- Da Nang.

1292
02:01:05,227 --> 02:01:09,147
I thought I'd go get some steaks
for a barbecue. Would you like that?

1293
02:01:11,149 --> 02:01:14,945
It's been a long time
since you've lit a barbecue.

1294
02:01:15,987 --> 02:01:18,532
The charcoal's under the kitchen sink.

1295
02:01:18,657 --> 02:01:23,328
I'm gonna see if Vi
wants to come with me. See you later.

1296
02:01:40,011 --> 02:01:44,975
You want to be a part of it
and patriotic and go out and...

1297
02:01:45,100 --> 02:01:48,103
get your licks in for the US of A.

1298
02:01:50,939 --> 02:01:57,154
And when you get over there,
it's a totally different situation.

1299
02:01:58,738 --> 02:02:00,782
I mean...

1300
02:02:02,367 --> 02:02:05,579
you grow up real quick

1301
02:02:05,704 --> 02:02:09,583
because all you're seeing is a lot of death.

And I know some of you
are gonna look at that uniform

1307
02:02:48,789 --> 02:02:54,252
and you're gonna remember all the films
and think about the glory of other wars

1308
02:02:54,377 --> 02:02:56,963
and think about some vague...

patriotic feeling

1310
02:03:01,760 --> 02:03:05,263

in the movies. I didn't have a choice.

1317
02:03:36,503 --> 02:03:41,258
When I was your age, all I got was
some guy standing up like that man

1318
02:03:41,383 --> 02:03:43,468
and giving me bullshit, which I caught.

1319
02:03:43,593 --> 02:03:47,097
I was really in good shape then.
I was captain of the football team.

1320
02:03:47,222 --> 02:03:52,269
I wanted to be a war hero, man.
I wanted to go out and kill for my country.

I have killed for my country or whatever

1325
02:04:16,209 --> 02:04:18,753
and I don't feel good about it.

1326
02:04:22,716 --> 02:04:26,428
Because there's not
enough reason, man...

1327

to feel a person die in your hands
or to see your best buddy get blown away.

I'm here to tell you it's a lousy thing, man.

I don't see any reason for it.

1330

And there's a lot of shit
that I did over there
