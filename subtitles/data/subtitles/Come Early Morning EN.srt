1
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,549
Shit.

2
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,277
Where you running off to, Luce?

3
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,911
- I said...
- Don't touch me.

4
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,835
Where's the friendly girl
I met in the bar last night?

5
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,030
I think we both got what we wanted.

6
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,475
- Are you serious?
- Just honest.

7
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,953
Don't fucking touch me!

8
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,393
You were a hell of a lot more fun
on your drunk-ass back.

9
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,270
Room's already been taken care of.

10
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,949
- Yeah, but I'd like to pay for it.
- I already ran a card through.

11
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,595
Well, can you credit his account
and put it on mine?

12
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,797
You both checking out,
or is Romeo sleeping in?

13
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,559
- Is that clock right?
- Last time I checked.

14
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,916
Can you call me a cab, please?

15
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,671
It's extra if he's not out by noon.

16
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,795
Yeah.

17
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,513
- Hi.
- Hi.

18
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,758
- Did you have fun?
- Mm-hmm.

19
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,589
Fuck.

20
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,799
Oh, damn it.

21
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,429
Where'd you stay?

22
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,949
- Motel.
- Why?

23
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,437
I think he said
he lived with his mom.

24
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,120
- Or his wife?
- That guy call?

25
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,870
No.

26
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,399
Only reason he asked
for your phone number

27
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,114
is so he wouldn't seem like a jerk
for wanting to screw you the other night.

28
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,151
Well, then I hope he doesn't call.

29
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,471
- Want coffee?
- No. Thanks. I'll get some on the way.

30
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,230
Pack of smokes.

31
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,515
- You buy two, you get a free one.
- Okay.

32
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,920
I don't know why y'all
don't use plastic flowers.

33
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,076
Look a hell of a lot better than these.

34
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,479
A lot cheaper, too.

35
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,990
- Kind of in a hurry, Sue.
- I've never seen you when you weren't.

36
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,715
- Stay out of the heat.
- Try to.

37
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,028
Oh, put my tape in, would you?

38
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,079
Your VCR's broke.

39
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,395
My son brought me a new one.

40
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,113
When'd you see Dad?

41
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,356
Oh, he stopped by.

42
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,396
- You want last week's?
- Yeah, it's the one on top.

43
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,554
Was he...

44
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,431
Well, how'd he seem?

45
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:40,559
He's going to some new
holy roller church.

46
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,955
Hey.

47
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,475
Hey.

48
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,919
I wanted to stop by
and see how the new apartment was.

49
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,075
It's fine.

50
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,395
It's a nice complex.

51
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,508
All your stuff fit?

52
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,790
I had to get rid of some things.

53
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,558
Keep your old chair?

54
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,669
Yeah.

55
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,995
We'll probably bury you in that thing.

56
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,952
I just thought I'd stop by
and see how things were.

57
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,677
Well, I'll let you get back
to what you were doing.

58
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,314
I've got some errands I need to run.

59
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,953
All right.

60
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,439
Okay.

61
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,995
Hey, Dad.

62
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,236
Doll says you're going
to some new church.

63
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,588
Yeah.

64
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,557
Well, you going tomorrow?

65
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,590
Yeah.

66
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,790
Can I come with you?

67
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,240
I leave around 8:45.

68
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,748
I'll see you then.

69
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,034
I can't believe y'all can't smell that.
Smells awful.

70
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,628
I still ain't got a sense of smell
since that infection.

71
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,910
- The one you had a while ago?
- Yeah.

72
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,429
- Is it gonna come back?
- Beats me.

73
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,993
Watch your fingers, Hattie.

74
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,917
What you want me
to watch 'em do, Ed?

75
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,235
Nana, are these the mushrooms
I made at Christmas?

76
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,356
Well, that or mold.
What's the difference?

77
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,711
- I thought you liked my mushrooms.
- No, Tim likes your mushrooms.

78
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,478
Uncle Tim can't taste.

79
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,272
I can taste, I just can't smell.

80
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,038
I'd like some mushrooms.

81
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,839
- Have you heard from Mom lately?
- She called a couple days ago.

82
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,679
She said the weather's nice
and she hates herjob.

83
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,234
- I don't know why she doesn'tjust quit.
- Leslie Jo called?

84
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,676
- Well, you talked to her, Ed.
- When did I talk to her?

85
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,518
A couple days ago when she called.

86
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,358
- I did not!
- Did too!

87
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,119
- I did not!
- Well, you did when she called!

88
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,719
Nana, I can't tell if the cornbread's done.

89
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,796
Well, stick a knife in it.

90
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,312
Tonightjust ain't your night, Lucy.

91
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,635
I play better when I'm drunk.

92
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,512
No, you don't.

93
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,868
Corner pocket.

94
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,836
- Want another beer?
- You bet.

95
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,190
A couple Coors, Bob.

96
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,673
Sure thing.

97
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,268
This is gonna be the last one for me.

98
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,078
You're gonna quit while you're behind?

99
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,595
- What is she doing here?
- What's that?

100
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,919
Nothing.

101
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,109
Hit it a little harder, pumpkin,
and it might go in.

102
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,633
It's your shot, Eli.

103
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,673
Aren't you even gonna say hi?

104
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,189
Where are your manners?
Did you leave 'em out in your car?

105
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,629
I drive a truck, bitch.
It's your shot, Eli.

106
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,392
What a mouth on you.

107
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,676
I'd think your daddy would have
taught you better than that.

108
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,232
By the way, how is your daddy?

109
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,958
Staying out of the trash.

110
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,230
Ooh!

111
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,271
And you must really miss him.

112
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,874
- Fuck you.
- Hey, I'm sorry, honey.

113
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,514
One per family is my limit.

114
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,713
Easy. Easy, easy, easy, easy, easy.

115
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,671
Calm down, calm down, calm down.

116
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,475
Calm down.

117
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,909
All right?

118
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,793
Now, I'm no judge,
but I think you got the best of...

119
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,633
You might wanna put some ice on that,
keep the swelling down.

120
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,193
You might wanna fuck off.

121
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,958
- You all right?
- Unh!

122
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,112
- Want me to drive you home?
- I'm fine, Eli.

123
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,834
She'll be all right.
Let's have a beer.

124
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,549
Oh...

125
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,470
Shit.

126
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,031
- You know it's Sunday, right?
- Mm-hmm.

127
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,595
Why are you wearing a skirt?

128
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,950
Have you seen my bible anywhere?

129
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,559
Did I miss Easter?

130
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,511
Oh, I know it's here somewhere.

131
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,511
- What?
- My bible.

132
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,039
- You sure you have one?
- Everybody has a bible.

133
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,432
And what do you need it for?

134
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,835
My dad invited me
to go to church with him.

135
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,351
When did you see your dad?

136
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,799
Quik Stop.

137
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,229
They sell dads there now?

138
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,952
Buy two, get one free.

139
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,677
What happened to your face?

140
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,075
Got in a fight, Kim.
Don't really wanna talk about it.

141
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:03,916
Okay.

142
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,993
Praise God.

143
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,270
Oh, my goodness, that was beautiful.
That was wonderful.

144
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:50,109
You know, I do believe Jesus likes
a little rock 'n' roll in the morning.

145
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,673
Amen!

146
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,399
Thank you so much.

147
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,590
Fellas, have a seat, please.
You've worked so hard.

148
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,477
Ladies and gentlemen, please.

149
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,477
We're liable to be here a while.

150
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,518
Oh. You know, uh,

151
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,160
people ask me all the time
who Jesus is.

152
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,471
Well, uh, there's a whole book here on it.

153
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,637
But, uh, they seem to want it in a nutshell.

154
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,594
Well, Jesus himself said in John 14:6...

155
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,359
"I am the way."

156
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,390
Hallelujah.

157
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:29,230
"I am the truth, and I am the light."

158
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,679
Amen!

159
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,033
I liked your church.

160
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,996
The preacher's a smart man.

161
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,874
Seemed like it.

162
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,119
The music was different.

163
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:11,438
The last chapter of Psalms says,
"Praise him with trumpet sound.

164
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,955
Praise him with lute and harp."

165
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,594
Guess a lute player
is pretty hard to come by.

166
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,075
We just used a guitar.

167
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,514
I'd like to come with you
next Sunday, if that's all right.

168
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,395
All right.

169
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,159
It was good to see you.

170
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,794
You too.

171
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,874
See you then.

172
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,675
I figure they'll start
digging those footings today.

173
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,473
Rebar's here.
Concrete shows up Wednesday.

174
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,357
Are they excavating
that area marked off back there?

175
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,390
Yeah.

176
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,152
I think this neighborhood
has a green barrier

177
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,191
that restricts commercial building
to 30 feet.

178
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,919
You think or you know?

179
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:09,916
I know.

180
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:14,830
The plans the developer gave me
had that whole area marked off.

181
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,428
Seems like somebody was trying
to put one over on you.

182
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,391
Hell, yes, they were.

183
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,274
Somebody's ass got greased.
Probably down at the planning commission.

184
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,039
How was your weekend?

185
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,478
Got in a fight, Owen,
and I don't wanna talk about it.

186
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,872
I'd hate to see the other guy.

187
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,189
Girl.

188
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,758
- Anybody I know?
- God...

189
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,474
Let's hope not.

190
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,113
He got pissed off.

191
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,314
That dog.

192
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,913
- Hey.
- Hey.

193
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,115
What's going on?

194
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,713
Getting a new jukebox.

195
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,313
Well, what's wrong with the old one?

196
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,079
People don't wanna hear music
sung by dead folks.

197
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,031
Yeah, they do.

198
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,151
Nope. They want that new country.

199
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,271
Oh, God! No, they don't!

200
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,315
Yeah, they do.

201
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,954
- Well, I don't.
- Well, you're the only one.

202
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,960
- Eli doesn't.
- No, I don't.

203
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,036
Okay. You and Eli.

204
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,189
Mike doesn't.

205
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,234
Yeah, I do.

206
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,277
See there?
And Mike knows music.

207
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,431
You drinking or talking?

208
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,434
Need some help, girl?

209
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,279
How you feeling?

210
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,714
Fine.

211
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:34,194
I've been in a few fights. Usually I feel
like a truck hit me the next day.

212
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,639
Yeah. I'm fine.

213
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,834
Thanks.

214
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,793
My God, the music in there is awful!

215
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,310
Thanks.

216
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,315
Okay.

217
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,596
But you're using bigger rocks.

218
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,477
No, I'm not.

219
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,708
Well, whatever.
You little cheater.

220
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,194
You from here?

221
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,512
How about you? Where...

222
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,068
I don't know why you're doing that,
'cause you're already winning.

223
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,710
Kentucky.

224
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,914
What do you do?

225
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,479
Contracting.

226
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,029
Foundations mostly.

227
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,794
- How long you been doing that?
- Nine years.

228
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,148
You enjoy it?

229
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,349
Yeah.

230
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,835
What do you do?

231
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,434
A client asked me to come down
and help her out doing some roofing.

232
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,630
- Sanders Roofing... you ever hear of it?
- Yeah, yeah. Mm-hmm.

233
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,039
They're pretty big.

234
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,276
- Thanks for the beer.
- Oh, you're welcome.

235
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,349
- Can I get your number?
- What for?

236
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,999
So I can ask you out.

237
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,878
On a date?

238
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,910
Yeah.

239
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,035
Right.

240
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,792
You seeing someone?

241
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,276
Mm-mm.

242
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,634
So...

243
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,237
- I'm listed.
- Under what?

244
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,679
Little Miss Muffett?

245
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,279
What's that supposed to mean?

246
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,515
Nothing.

247
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,673
Lucille.

248
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,518
Lucille...

249
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,914
Fowler.

250
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,508
Fowler. Lucille Fowler.

251
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,198
Okay.

252
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,759
Cal. Cal Percell.

253
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,914
What's he look like?

254
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,716
Like every other guy at the Star Studded,
except he doesn't wear Wranglers.

255
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,155
- How do you know?
- Know what?

256
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,111
That he doesn't wear Wranglers.

257
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,909
Kim!

258
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,555
Hello?

259
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,880
Well, you don't wear
the new shirts you already have.

260
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,799
Blouses.

261
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,190
They have a sale every other week.

262
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,789
Okay.

263
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,430
How about if I come get you
tomorrow at my lunch?

264
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,678
I'll see you then.

265
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,631
Did you give him your number?

266
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,711
I'm not taking these back
when you decide you don't want them.

267
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,319
They already hate us in that store.

268
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,799
I forgot to look.

269
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,997
- Now, were they on sale?
- Of course they were on sale.

270
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,509
It's 100 degrees outside
and they're long-sleeved.

271
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,478
Well, I want my arms covered.

272
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,874
I'm gonna get you
some salve for your face.

273
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,753
No, it's fine.
Listen, Doll, I gotta get back to work.

274
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,598
Do you want me to put these
in your closet for you?

275
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:47,349
Yeah. Don't I have a denim blouse?

276
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,072
You have five.

277
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,315
Mm, what's that?

278
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,358
Food you actually have to
sit down to get.

279
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,071
- Is that the Bonner project?
- Mm-hmm.

280
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,870
What do you think our bid's going to be?

281
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,069
Forty?

282
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,275
Maybe 38, if I can get
that deal on the concrete.

283
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,628
You'll get it.

284
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,638
Oh, a Frank Bryant
from Mississippi called.

285
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,191
Go on, doggy. Go on!

286
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,839
Shoo, dog! Kyah!

287
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,478
Don't you got a home?

288
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,874
Ah, crap.

289
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,271
Are you mean?
Are you gonna bite me?

290
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,197
Oh, what happened to your ear?

291
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,194
Did you get in a fight?

292
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,235
I'm real sorry, sweetie,
but Dr. Henry won't be in until Monday.

293
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,158
He and his family have gone to Branson.
They got a timeshare condo there.

294
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,589
Well, it looks infected to me.

295
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,037
You could take her over to Little Rock.

296
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:10,233
Well, can I just bring her in
first thing Monday morning?

297
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,958
Sure, you can.
Now what's her name?

298
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,752
She doesn't have one.
I just found her.

299
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,713
Well, I gotta have something
put down in the appointment book.

300
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,629
Bessie.

301
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,279
Do you maybe have
some ointment or something?

302
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,152
Yeah, I think I got
a sample here somewhere.

303
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,278
- Oh, here you go.
- Thanks.

304
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,119
Oh, she sure is a cutie.
We'll see you Monday.

305
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,198
Is it true that when
you take 'em to the pound,

306
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,594
they put 'em to sleep after a week?

307
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,358
Yes, ma'am, they sure do.

308
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,792
So what's up with your face?

309
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,433
Nothing. It's stupid.

310
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,755
- Did you get a puppy?
- No, I found a stray.

311
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,796
Keeping it?

312
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,431
Taking it to the pound on Monday.

313
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,634
Big eater, huh?

314
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,430
See ya.

315
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,918
Go on, wanna go inside?

316
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,799
Did they fix her ear?

317
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,315
Nah. The vet was out of town.

318
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,469
What?

319
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,431
Cal called.

320
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,920
- You gonna go out with him?
- I don't know.

321
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,359
I think you should.

322
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,596
I don't even know him.

323
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,033
He's a complete stranger.

324
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,559
Oh, that's right.

325
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,548
You only sleep with complete strangers.

326
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,194
Maybe you should just have him
meet you at a motel then.

327
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,231
- It'd save time.
- And money.

328
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,555
Courting can be
pretty expensive these days.

329
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:47,475
"Courting." Time for you
to cut back on the Andy Griffith.

330
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:51,158
- You are such a chicken shit.
- I am not.

331
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,992
I just felt sorry
for your Ionely ass staying home.

332
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,235
You didn't tell me he had T-tops.

333
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,508
Oh, excuse me.

334
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,469
I'm Kim.

335
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,477
Kim? Cal. Cal Percell.

336
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,113
- Hi.
- Hi.

337
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:39,950
Oh, no!

338
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,629
Yeah, what can I get you?

339
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,716
- I got it, I got it.
- Let me get this round.

340
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,915
You got the last one.

341
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:52,959
I asked you on a date.
Let me take care of this. Thank you.

342
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,032
- Thank you, Cal.
- Sure.

343
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,479
Excuse me. Ma'am?

344
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,712
Would you like to dance?

345
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,670
Okay.

346
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,435
Well, to our date.

347
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,799
If you'll let me.

348
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,155
Have you decided what you're
going to do with that old jukebox?

349
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,389
Not yet.

350
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,994
- How come you like old music so much?
- I don't know.

351
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,269
Have you always?

352
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,595
I liked nursery rhymes for a while.

353
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,236
My dad used to play guitar for me
when I was little,

354
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:11,557
and he loves all the old music,
so that's probably why.

355
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,715
Was he any good?

356
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,273
Hell, what'd I know?
I was eight.

357
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,956
- Well, if you liked it...
- I reckon.

358
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,630
He had a band when he was younger,

359
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,478
and they played
in all the bars and stuff around here.

360
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,629
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

361
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,909
- But there is one problem.
- What's that?

362
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,199
He's kind of shy,

363
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:35,477
and my mom says he'd have to be
shit-faced to play in public,

364
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,831
or else he'd make
somebody else stand on stage

365
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:41,070
with a guitar
that wasn't plugged in.

366
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,395
But he'd still be playing?

367
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,471
Yeah, behind a curtain or something.

368
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,031
- Yeah, I'd say that's shy.
- Yeah.

369
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,519
He still play for you?

370
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,079
I gotta pee.

371
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,911
You want Kim to go with you?

372
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,952
Three shots of Jack, please.

373
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,000
- Is Kim still dancing?
- Uh, yeah.

374
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,879
You wanna?

375
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,995
Sure.

376
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,672
- You know how?
- I took cotillion.

377
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,678
Don't sleep with him.

378
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,518
Feed Bessie. Whoa!

379
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,669
Oops.

380
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,119
You all right, hon?

381
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,239
Ohh...

382
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,278
This is nice.

383
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,753
- Who lives in the front house?
- My aunt and uncle.

384
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:19,998
They were kind enough
to let me stay here till I get my own place.

385
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,470
There's a light here somewhere.

386
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,715
There we are.

387
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,033
Got any beer?

388
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,388
Uh, yeah.

389
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:37,076
- Is that your mom?
- Oh, that's my Aunt Wanda.

390
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,274
Looks like a spitfire.

391
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,109
- Your uncle?
- Carl.

392
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,790
- They still married?
- 35 years.

393
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,194
Shit, really?

394
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,512
Are they happy?

395
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,514
Seem to be.

396
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,438
What about your parents?

397
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,754
Divorced when I was ten. Yours?

398
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,359
Mm-hmm, yeah.

399
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,795
My dad had trouble
with the whole being faithful thing.

400
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,717
That woman at the bar...

401
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,033
She wasn't the first.

402
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,716
How many asses
you gonna kick, girl?

403
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,831
Whoa. Whoa.

404
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,951
When was the last time
you kissed someone sober?

405
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,555
Huh?

406
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,756
Johnny Patterson.

407
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,357
Skating rink, back corner.

408
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,193
Wasn't any good, though.

409
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,151
Old Johnny had a hard tongue.

410
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,397
Why don't I give you a hand?

411
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,876
You have a skating rink
where you grew up?

412
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,915
Yeah.

413
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,551
Yeah. And, uh...

414
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,352
I could skate backwards.

415
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,630
What are you doing?

416
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,439
I've gotta go.

417
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:42,028
What time is it?

418
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,395
Well, how are you planning
on getting home?

419
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,035
A taxi?

420
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,152
Jesus, Lucy, I'll take you.

421
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,475
- Well, thanks for the ride.
- Any time.

422
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,591
Kim's home, so the door is unlocked.

423
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,192
Just get out of the car, Lucy.

424
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,599
Wanna go outside? Come on.

425
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,192
Come on, Bessie, go outside.

426
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,399
- Did you have fun?
- Oh!

427
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,832
Scare me half to death.

428
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,352
You're home awfully early.

429
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:16,792
What were we supposed to do, sit around
and drink coffee and pretend we're in love?

430
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,316
How aboutjust sit around and drink coffee?

431
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,793
He didn't have any.

432
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,992
Anything happen with you and that guy?

433
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,235
No.

434
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,913
You give him your number?

435
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,351
Oh, Jesus, Kim, you didn't.

436
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,595
So what if I did?

437
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,438
Well, are you just stupid?

438
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:42,110
I mean, my God,
don't you ever get tired

439
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,152
of sitting around
waiting for some jackass to call?

440
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,157
Don't you ever get tired of not?

441
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,550
What do you got against
getting to know these guys?

442
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,238
I thought we got to know each other.

443
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,151
Okay, a little better.

444
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,996
I mean, God, Lucy,
don't you ever meet someone

445
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,509
and wonder what they looked like
when they were little?

446
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,511
Or what their middle name is?

447
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,556
You know, stupid stuff like that.

448
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,311
Do you think he'll call you again?

449
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,671
- Call him.
- I can't.

450
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,513
Why don't you go back over there?

451
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,148
Because, Kim,
I wouldn't know what to say.

452
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,150
Well...

453
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:46,078
He left about ten feet of rubber, so...

454
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,590
I'm guessing "sorry"
might be a good place to start.

455
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,879
Do you know how long it's been
since I kissed somebody sober?

456
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,633
You forget something?

457
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,233
No. I brought you the paper.

458
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,678
There might be places to rent.

459
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,634
Come on in.

460
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:07,512
You want something to drink?
There's not much.

461
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,875
- Cold beer, maybe a soda?
- No, I'm fine.

462
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:18,194
You kind of caught me in the middle
of gluing this damn thing together.

463
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,033
What is it?

464
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:26,638
It's a '71 Boss Mustang
with a 351 Windsor.

465
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,108
It's an engine.

466
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,553
What's this?

467
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,199
It's a passenger seat.

468
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,590
You wanna paint it?

469
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,715
Can I?

470
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:42,870
Sure.

471
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,189
No, you can't paint it blue.

472
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,594
It has to be black.

473
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:50,994
How come?

474
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,076
'Cause blue wasn't an option.

475
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,195
How do you mean?

476
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:58,518
I mean you had three colors
from the manufacturer for your interior

477
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,756
when you bought this car.

478
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:01,676
Black,

479
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,358
red,

480
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,515
green.

481
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,555
Well, you're not the manufacturer
and this isn't a real car.

482
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:08,869
No, it's not.

483
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,952
It's a model.
A model of a real car.

484
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,917
Well, what if somebody really liked blue

485
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,076
and they had a lot of money
and they paid the manufacturer extra?

486
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,838
You wanna paint it or not?

487
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,876
Either you paint it black,

488
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,434
or go down to the store
and we'll get your very own car.

489
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,437
And you can paint it any color you like.

490
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,879
Black it is.

491
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,959
You know how to paint?

492
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:37,273
Okay. Don't get any on your fingers.
It's really hard to get off.

493
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,589
Not too thick.

494
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,194
You done a lot of these?

495
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,799
Quite a few.

496
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,959
Can I ask a question?

497
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,354
What's that?

498
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:57,836
It's already black plastic.
How come I have to paint it black?

499
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,909
You know what?
I just remembered why I do this alone.

500
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,438
You wanna go for a drive?

501
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,594
Caught a couple of frogs out here
not too long ago.

502
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,511
- Frogs?
- Big ones.

503
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,635
- How?
- With a gig.

504
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,274
What? Like frog giggin'?

505
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:47,591
- Yeah. You never done it?
- No.

506
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:49,153
You've never been frog giggin'?

507
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,753
What do you do with 'em
when you get 'em?

508
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,478
You eat 'em.

509
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,079
- No way. Are you serious?
- Yeah.

510
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,794
Now, if you see one, you spear 'em
right through the middle, all right?

511
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:01,635
Look over there.

512
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,228
- No, I don't think I can do this.
- Sure you can, sure you can.

513
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:06,112
It's like poking a marshmallow
with a coat hanger.

514
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,639
You've made s'mores before, haven't you?

515
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,159
Yeah, I was a Girl Scout.

516
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,998
- I think I see one.
- Where?

517
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,155
Shine the light, shine the light over here.

518
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:14,032
Gig him. Get him!

519
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,720
Get him! Yeah, there he is.

520
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:18,114
- Oh, my God!
- Good job.

521
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:19,793
Ohh! Oh!

522
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:21,791
- Aah! Quit it, quit it!
- Big one. That's a big one.

523
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:28,552
Okay. We need about ten more,
and then we're gonna have a proper meal.

524
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:31,513
- Now get back here.
- Oh, that is disgusting.

525
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,358
It's pretty gross, isn't it?

526
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:41,990
All done.

527
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:45,751
I bet you thought I couldn't do it.

528
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:47,438
Never had a doubt in my mind.

529
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,033
Horseshit.

530
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,388
You want a beer?

531
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:53,708
No.

532
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,192
Wash 'em good.

533
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,039
I'm all cleaned up.

534
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,119
All for you.

535
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:27,759
Slow down.

536
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:32,915
Sit down.

537
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:55,996
Let me look at you.

538
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,513
Turn over.

539
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:21,959
Take this off.

540
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:29,833
I like your back.

541
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,228
It's strong.

542
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:43,032
You have little ears.

543
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,593
Yeah, I do.

544
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,189
Come here.

545
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:26,473
You okay?

546
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:38,714
Ohh. Uhh.

547
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:50,878
Planning your escape route?

548
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:13,514
Okay, look.

549
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,392
You suck at sneaking out.

550
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:20,516
Were you just grounded non-stop
as a teenager?

551
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,716
Cal, I really didn't want
to wake you up.

552
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:25,319
Oh. Okay.

553
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:28,673
'Cause I was beginning to think
you're just not comfortable

554
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,472
with this whole morning after thing.

555
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:36,320
So where are you going?
To catch a worm?

556
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:37,753
Church.

557
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:42,752
No kidding. I didn't figure you
for the church-going type.

558
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,598
Well, you figured wrong.

559
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:50,749
What are you doing later?

560
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:53,235
Those frog legs aren't
gonna cook themselves.

561
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:56,314
Well, I didn't figure you
for the cooking kind.

562
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:58,396
Well, look who figured wrong now.

563
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:02,718
You wanna cook 'em at my house?

564
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:04,796
I mean, my kitchen's bigger.

565
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:08,393
What are you trying to say?

566
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:09,709
Nothing.

567
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,718
Yeah, I'll come over to your house.

568
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,552
Can I borrow your t-shirt?

569
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:18,033
Yeah.

570
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:21,715
Can I do anything?

571
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:23,711
I'm not all that good with salads.

572
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:24,829
Okay.

573
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:43,952
Our deepest fear
is not that we are inadequate.

574
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:48,238
Our deepest fear
is that we are powerful beyond measure.

575
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:52,751
It is our light, not our darkness,
that most frightens us.

576
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:55,519
And I believe that.
I believe that with the bottom of my heart.

577
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:59,158
We are all children of God,
all of us.

578
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:02,869
And as sure as you have
your parents' DNA, you have his.

579
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:05,758
Because as Jesus said,

580
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:10,431
"On that day you will know
that I am in our Father,

581
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:12,915
and you in me,
and I in you."

582
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:13,990
Praise God.

583
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:17,914
Make manifest that which is of God
that is within you.

584
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,992
It's a huge gift, man!
It's a huge gift.

585
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,518
And how do we do that?

586
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:27,118
Very simple.

587
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:29,390
It's right here in Matthew 7:7.

588
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:34,672
"Ask and the gift will be yours.

589
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,950
"Seek and you will find.

590
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:39,913
"Knock and the door will open to you.

591
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:42,600
For everyone who asks receives."

592
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:46,918
The seeker finds,
and the door is open to anyone who knocks.

593
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:48,678
Amen. Amen.

594
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,711
Come on, girls.
You're slowing me up.

595
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:36,434
- You eat these a lot?
- Only when they're in season.

596
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:38,596
There's a season for frog legs?

597
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:44,598
Come on.
Bring it over here. Let's go.

598
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:52,835
Well, what do you think?
Tastes like chicken.

599
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:55,790
Not... not exactly.

600
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,434
Oh, come on. It's not that bad.

601
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:02,319
Maybe it's an acquired taste.

602
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:05,318
No, either you like it or you don't.
They're not gonna grow on you.

603
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:09,157
Lucy, would you mind
getting me another beer?

604
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:17,151
- Want one, Kim?
- No, I'm good.

605
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:28,636
If you happen to care for another,
they're in the icebox,

606
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:30,751
that big white shiny thing
in the kitchen.

607
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:36,638
Yeah. Think I've seen it.

608
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:54,715
Lucy, I didn't mean to disrespect you.

609
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:57,836
No, Cal, it's fine.

610
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:01,554
It's fine.

611
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:07,311
Could you throw it out for me?

612
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:12,315
- Yeah, I could do that.
- Thank you.

613
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:19,638
Well, good night, girl.

614
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:33,513
Cal?

615
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:36,431
What'd you do up in Kentucky?

616
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:38,479
I had a little business.

617
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:40,556
- Doing what?
- Car restoration.

618
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:43,550
Probably figured out by now
I like cars.

619
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:46,554
Why'd you give it up?

620
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:51,430
I like to think
I'll do it again someday.

621
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:56,995
Cal?

622
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:58,798
What's your middle name?

623
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:00,839
I don't have one.

624
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,672
Come on, Bessie.

625
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:15,714
Come on. Good girl.

626
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:24,195
I'm sorry, sweetie.

627
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:26,356
Their car broke down
somewhere near Dennard,

628
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:28,755
and it being Sunday and all,
of course nothing was open.

629
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:30,990
Anyway, they said they'd have it
fixed this afternoon,

630
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:32,434
he'd be home later tonight.

631
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:35,597
It was just a hose or something like that.
Everybody's okay, thank God.

632
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:36,994
Why don't you just leave her here with me?

633
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:39,594
It'd save you a trip back.
He'll get to her first thing in the morning.

634
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:41,992
That's okay.
You're on my way to work.

635
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:43,553
I can just stop back by.

636
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:44,954
- I am sorry.
- That's okay.

637
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:46,229
Thanks.

638
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:50,197
The pound will put her
to sleep after a week.

639
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:51,594
Mm-hmm, I know.

640
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,592
Did you ever hear Dad play guitar?

641
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:03,396
Yeah, that time he played
with Chet Atkins.

642
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:05,476
What?

643
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:06,675
When?

644
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:08,870
When he played with Chet Atkins.

645
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,672
You never heard this story?

646
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:15,352
I can't believe this.

647
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:17,198
That's where you got your name.

648
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:20,076
You really never heard this story?

649
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:21,997
- God damn it, no.
- Okay.

650
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:27,715
Well, him and Leslie Jo
used to go down to the Cimarron.

651
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:30,598
Well, shit, it's that same
honky-tonk disco you go to now.

652
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:33,317
And the way I understood it,

653
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:37,996
if your dad was drunk enough,
he'd sit in with whatever band was playing.

654
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:41,317
And I guess he got a reputation
down there for being pretty good.

655
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:45,871
So when Chet come to town,
he called him up to the stage.

656
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:49,350
I couldn't believe it.
He kept him up there most of the night.

657
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:53,871
So Chet gave him a solo
during that song Lucille.

658
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:58,988
And your dad fucking tore the house down.

659
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:00,269
God!

660
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:02,197
I'm getting chills
just thinking about it.

661
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:06,272
People talked about it for years.

662
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:11,639
Took about ten days
for Lowell's feet to hit the ground.

663
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:15,199
So why'd he quit playing?

664
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:18,874
Lucy, I don't know.
Life, I guess.

665
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:23,155
Started working for his dad.
Then little old you come along.

666
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:27,754
Oh!

667
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:29,074
Did I tell you?

668
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:32,038
That smell over at Mother's...
catfish.

669
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:37,752
I was cleaning up on top of the fridge
where she keeps all that old bread,

670
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:39,194
and I found a catfish.

671
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,471
Been there for about ten days
in this heat.

672
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:45,160
- Oh, that's disgusting.
- Disgusting.

673
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:48,911
Even I could smell it.
About threw up is what I did.

674
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:55,956
Nana? Got any old catfish?

675
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:02,231
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

676
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:04,635
You, uh, you want a bourbon?

677
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:07,715
- What did he do to you?
- Nothing.

678
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:10,070
I'm fine.

679
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:16,795
- Nana!
- Leave me alone, Lucy.

680
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:21,278
What did you do to her?

681
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:30,469
Ed, you are a mean,
pathetic son of a bitch.

682
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:56,519
You're all gussied up.

683
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:00,191
You going out on the town?

684
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:02,959
- No.
- Well, you got your gold shoes on.

685
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:04,953
Oh.

686
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:07,235
My hair looks like a brush pile.

687
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:09,794
- Do you need a drink of water?
- No.

688
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:13,549
- Anybody with you?
- No, ma'am. Just me.

689
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:16,760
I brought you some peas.
They're fresh. You want some now?

690
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:18,950
No, I'll wait a while.

691
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:21,076
Well, don't forget they're in there.

692
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:30,554
I wanna go see Buford Saturday.

693
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:37,671
How come you still go to his grave?

694
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:46,958
Well, did his drinking
just not bother you?

695
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:49,832
He was my husband.

696
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:54,113
He left you, Doll.

697
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,674
You got no say over your heart, Lucy.

698
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:03,158
And if you think you do,

699
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:05,635
you'd best not let yours roam too far.

700
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:18,875
Lucy.

701
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:22,150
- The vetjust called.
- Oh, is Bessie ready?

702
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:24,038
Owen, do you mind
if I go get her?

703
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:26,993
I don't have to bring her here.
I can drop her off at home.

704
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:28,519
She didn't make it.

705
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:33,398
They had to put her under for the surgery
and she... she didn't wake up.

706
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:35,590
Well, maybe she is by now.
I should call.

707
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:40,992
Lucy, they said that
she had a heart defect,

708
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:43,350
that she was weak and...

709
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:46,632
Well, she's gone.

710
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:53,149
I see.

711
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:01,912
Why don't you take
the rest of the day off?

712
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,797
It was just a dog, Owen.

713
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:07,433
I was taking her to the pound anyway.
I don't need to take the day off.

714
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:18,715
So what are you gonna do
with thatjukebox?

715
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:20,949
I don't know.

716
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:24,396
It ain't gonna play
in the back of your truck.

717
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:30,753
- Wanna shoot some pool.
- Nah.

718
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:34,631
Well, you're about as much fun
as a sack of taters.

719
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:36,551
Hey, Mike, let's shoot some stick.

720
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:38,033
Rack 'em up.

721
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:41,668
Hey, girl.

722
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:45,354
I just talked to Kim.
Why didn't you call me?

723
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,149
Just a dog.

724
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:52,595
She had a heart defect.
She would've died anyway, only slow.

725
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:53,829
I know.

726
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:58,518
If you want, I could go pick her up

727
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:01,239
and we could bury her somewhere.

728
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:03,078
They said they took care of it.

729
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:05,475
How you been, Luce?

730
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:11,996
Come on, now.
Don't tell me you don't remember me.

731
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:14,957
Look, pal,
why don't you just back off?

732
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:18,793
I think she can tell me
whether or not she wants me to back off.

733
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:21,388
- Ain't that right, Luce?
- Don't touch me.

734
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:23,476
You are about two seconds
from getting your face cracked.

735
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:25,118
Knock it off, Cal.

736
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:28,078
This dirty whore ain't worth
getting your ass kicked over, buddy.

737
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:29,832
Stop it!

738
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:33,790
Take that shit out of here!
What in the hell's the matter with you?

739
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:35,996
What the fuck are you doing, Cal?

740
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:38,350
Lucy, that guy...
that guy was being an asshole.

741
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:40,956
Aw, man, I could've
handled it, Cal.

742
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:44,835
Lucy.

743
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:46,234
Lucy.

744
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:49,509
Lucy.

745
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:52,232
Lucy, he didn't have the right.

746
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:54,675
- I fucked him, Cal.
- So?

747
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:58,913
I fucked him and I don't remember.
I think that pretty much gives him the right.

748
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:01,110
- That's where you're wrong.
- That's where you're wrong.

749
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:02,918
And I don't know where you get off
getting in the middle of something

750
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:04,519
that's none of your fucking business.

751
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:07,672
I was under the impression it was.

752
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:09,756
Well, you must've gotten
the wrong impression.

753
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:14,989
Okay.

754
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:41,874
What was he supposed to do?

755
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,513
Stay out of it.

756
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:48,315
Seems to me like the guy deserved it.

757
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:58,232
Answer it, Lucy.

758
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:06,229
Hello.

759
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:11,913
Yeah, this is Kim.

760
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:16,593
Yeah, I remember.

761
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:20,349
Oh.

762
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:22,032
Okay, I'd like that.

763
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:25,759
Friday sounds great.

764
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:29,632
Okay, I'll talk to you then, Lee.

765
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:48,269
I, um...

766
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:52,156
I need to talk to you
about something, Lucy.

767
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:55,399
Sure, Owen.

768
01:03:56,880 --> 01:04:00,953
Frank Bryant is a business associate
over in Jackson.

769
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:04,029
And he wants me
to come work for him.

770
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:08,072
I, uh, I think I'm gonna do it.

771
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:13,356
A little less responsibility
might do me good.

772
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:20,837
When would you go?

773
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:22,548
Pretty soon.

774
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:26,631
But we just started a site.

775
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:28,716
I can get somebody else
to handle it.

776
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:35,238
Lucy.

777
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:37,197
I want you to come with me.

778
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:40,509
Look, it's a bigger company,
the money would be better,

779
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:42,033
and I could really use you.

780
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:44,429
- Owen...
- You don't have to decide right now.

781
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:46,788
Just think about it.

782
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:49,679
Okay, I will.

783
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:09,995
One new message.

784
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:12,879
Hello, Lucy?

785
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,434
Uh, it's Doll.

786
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:18,438
Don't forget, I want
to go see Buford in the morning.

787
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:21,960
Okay. Bye now.

788
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:32,359
You look great.

789
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:34,872
Where y'all going?

790
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,514
- Cajun's Wharf.
- Fancy.

791
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:42,796
- You wanna come?
- No.

792
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:48,193
- Want me to get it?
- Yeah.

793
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:55,110
Hi.

794
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:57,354
Hi.

795
01:05:58,040 --> 01:05:59,359
I'm Lucy.

796
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:01,152
Lee Young. It's nice to meet you.

797
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:03,511
- You ready?
- Yeah.

798
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:32,156
So where are you from
originally, Mickey?

799
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:34,510
Well, Shreveport originally.

800
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:36,039
- Right.
- Yeah.

801
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:38,639
What's your middle name?

802
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:40,113
John.

803
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:42,390
Did your mother or daddy
give it to you?

804
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:44,670
Well, that's my dad's name.

805
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:48,676
What do you do, Lucy?

806
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:51,149
I told you my friends call me Luce.

807
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:52,508
Okay.

808
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:55,190
What do you...
What do you do, Luce?

809
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:56,753
I'm a veterinarian.

810
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:58,518
You like animals, do you?

811
01:06:58,640 --> 01:06:59,868
A lot.

812
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,479
I see. I see.

813
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:03,192
That require much school?

814
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:04,799
A lot.

815
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:07,271
Work much on horses?

816
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:08,799
All the time.

817
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:12,393
My friend's got a sick horse
over in Scott right now.

818
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:16,797
Well, God damn it, you should get me
over there as soon as possible.

819
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:20,194
Oh, right.

820
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,638
You know where the restroom is
in this place?

821
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:24,113
Dead ahead.

822
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:25,832
Will you excuse me?

823
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:27,598
Uh-huh. For...

824
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:31,797
...83 seconds.
How's that sound?

825
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:37,477
One, two...

826
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:51,355
What are you doing, Lucy?

827
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:53,714
Nothing.

828
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:55,751
Sure don't look like nothing to me.

829
01:07:55,880 --> 01:07:57,677
Well, nobody asked you, Eli.

830
01:07:57,800 --> 01:07:59,552
Come on, Lucy, you're drunk.

831
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:01,591
Let me get you out of here.
Let me take you home.

832
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:09,199
I've been calling you.

833
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:12,156
- I'm not there.
- Yeah, I can see that.

834
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:15,469
Lucy.

835
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:17,989
I hope I wasn't longer
than 83 seconds.

836
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:23,830
- Hate to get you mad.
- Mm-hmm.

837
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:26,428
What do you say, man? Mickey.

838
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:30,357
Cal. Cal Percell.

839
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:34,998
I just get in the middle
of something there?

840
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:36,030
Nah.

841
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:38,712
- You sure about that?
- Mm-hmm.

842
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:41,835
What do you say
we get out of here?

843
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:44,999
Sounds good to me.

844
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:47,518
- Thank you, buddy.
- You got it.

845
01:08:57,280 --> 01:08:59,111
This is me right here.

846
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:10,477
- All right, where to, girl?
- Don't call me girl.

847
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:13,715
Okay. Where to?

848
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:15,637
Where do you live?

849
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:18,320
- Rose City.
- Rose City sounds great.

850
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:24,558
Oh, hang on.
You crying?

851
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:26,153
No, no.

852
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:30,192
- Who's the guy?
- Nobody.

853
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:32,113
Maybe I should just
take you to his house.

854
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:34,714
Maybe you should just
shut the fuck up and drive!

855
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:37,479
Hang on a minute.
Now listen.

856
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:39,989
I would've taken you home with me tonight
'cause I thought that's what you wanted,

857
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:42,156
but that don't make me
a piece of shit, all right?

858
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:44,077
You're in my car, you're crying
all over the place.

859
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:45,957
I just cleaned the damn thing up.

860
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:49,075
And you obviously got some
pretty strong feelings for that no one,

861
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:51,555
and you're dead wrong
to put me in the middle of it.

862
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:54,072
Got too much respect for it.

863
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:56,839
From what I could see,
you could use a little yourself.

864
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,353
Fuck you!

865
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:00,359
Not tonight, sweetheart.

866
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:47,399
- Let's get you out of here.
- I'm fine.

867
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:50,313
No, you're not. Come on.
Let me grab your things.

868
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:53,113
Take me to my dad's.

869
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:55,071
It's kind of late, Lucy.

870
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:56,795
Please, Eli.

871
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:00,719
Where does he live?

872
01:11:01,480 --> 01:11:02,799
Over in Levy.

873
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:26,109
Dad?

874
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:30,792
Dad, it's Lucy.

875
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:33,518
I wanna talk to you.

876
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:37,954
Dad!

877
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:42,316
Dad, it's Lucy.
Can you hear me?

878
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:47,073
Open the fucking door, Dad!

879
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:49,634
Knock and the door shall open.

880
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:53,074
Matthew 7:7...
Knock and the door will open.

881
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:56,192
Well, I'm knocking.

882
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:03,992
Dad, I'm knocking on the door!

883
01:12:04,160 --> 01:12:06,549
Open the door!
Open the door!

884
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:09,111
Open the door!

885
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:11,993
Open the fucking door!

886
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:16,116
- Come on, Lucy.
- Eli, he's in there.

887
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:19,437
That son of a bitch is in there!
Open the fucking door!

888
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:21,112
Why won't he open the door?

889
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:24,038
Come on, Lucy, it's late.
Come on, let's go, let's get you home.

890
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:49,158
You trying to make it rain?

891
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:57,231
- Brought you your t-shirt.
- Thank you.

892
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:00,868
Listen, I was drunk last night.

893
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:02,797
Yeah, I don't really wanna hear it.

894
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:08,472
It didn't have anything to do with you.

895
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:10,511
I didn't think it did.

896
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:16,313
- Cal...
- Lucy.

897
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:18,555
Let's just call it.

898
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:23,235
Okay.

899
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:35,632
And I suppose you do.

900
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:37,716
Well, I know a hell of a lot
more than you do.

901
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:38,875
You didn't even finish school.

902
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:42,236
'Cause I married you,
unfortunately.

903
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:43,679
Well, I must have been drunk!

904
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:45,239
Oh, ho, ho!

905
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:51,073
I'm thinking of killing him

906
01:15:51,240 --> 01:15:53,470
and telling God, "He died."

907
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:00,957
Hey, wait, where are you going, missy?
Where you running off to?

908
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:03,389
I don't wanna stay here
and listen to you lying.

909
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:07,115
Well, that man is one sorry
son of a bitch.

910
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:09,390
- You married him.
- Oh...

911
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:11,556
Well, I didn't know
what I was getting into.

912
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:13,432
Well, guess what, you do now.

913
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:16,795
Well, I'm glad you got
all the answers.

914
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:18,273
I don't, Nana.

915
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:21,153
But if you're so miserable,
just do something about it

916
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:23,794
because I've mustered up
all the fucking sympathy I can.

917
01:16:23,960 --> 01:16:25,916
Well, poor you.

918
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:28,110
No, poor you.

919
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:30,716
You're as miserable as he is.

920
01:16:56,560 --> 01:17:02,317
So the part that I was looking at
that I don't really understand is,

921
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:05,989
"The Lord is long-suffering,
and of great mercy,

922
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:08,554
"forgiving iniquity and transgression,

923
01:17:08,680 --> 01:17:13,276
"and by no means clearing the guilty,

924
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:16,790
"visiting the iniquity of the fathers
upon the children

925
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:19,275
unto the third and fourth generation."

926
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:25,432
Well, um, Jeremiah 31:30 says,
"But all shall die for their own sins.

927
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:29,718
The teeth of every one
who eats sour grapes shall be set on edge."

928
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:31,114
I don't know what that means.

929
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:34,192
I don't wanna hear about teeth and grapes.

930
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:36,231
I wanna know about this.

931
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:40,319
About the sins of the father.
I wanna know what it means.

932
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:43,318
Why do I have to carry
shit around that's not mine?

933
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:47,149
Why would God do that to me?
It is so unfair!

934
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:51,357
You got anything against trees?

935
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:54,314
- No.
- Okay.

936
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:58,718
If a tree has Dutch elm disease
and it drops a seed,

937
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:01,035
the sapling that grows there
is gonna have the same disease,

938
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:04,476
and you're not gonna say that's unfair...
it's just how nature works.

939
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:06,232
It's how God works.

940
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:08,032
So, what, that's it?

941
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:10,435
I'm just supposed to live with it?

942
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:11,754
I don't know.

943
01:18:11,880 --> 01:18:13,552
I just know it's not God's doing.

944
01:18:13,680 --> 01:18:15,238
But last week you said,

945
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:16,958
"Ask and the gift will be yours,

946
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:20,396
seek and you shall find,
knock and the door will open."

947
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:24,479
Well, I've been fucking knocking
and knocking, and I'm tired of it!

948
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:27,913
So stop knocking.

949
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:30,794
And just walk in.

950
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:56,069
Hi.

951
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:58,073
Hey.

952
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:01,473
Can I come in?

953
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:05,914
Sure.

954
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:14,351
I wanted to apologize
for the other night.

955
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:16,679
You want a beer?

956
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:19,119
No, I'm fine.

957
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,833
And I was thinking it would be good
if we could talk about some things.

958
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:26,755
Sure you won't have a drink?

959
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:28,108
No, sir.

960
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:46,075
You start playing again?

961
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:51,192
No. Just messing around.

962
01:19:53,320 --> 01:19:54,389
That's good.

963
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:23,714
Uncle Tim says
you played with Chet Atkins?

964
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:26,635
Once.

965
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:46,952
Dad, I wanted to talk.

966
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:49,748
I'll let you get back
to what you were doing.

967
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:07,673
Thanks for the song.

968
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:36,717
Well, I hate to hear you
say that, Lucy,

969
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:38,796
but I guess I figured
you wouldn't.

970
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:44,910
Have you turned
the site over to anybody yet?

971
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:48,229
No.

972
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:53,112
Would you consider me?

973
01:22:57,480 --> 01:22:59,118
Well, hell, Lucy.

974
01:23:00,760 --> 01:23:02,512
I thought you would never ask.

975
01:23:06,120 --> 01:23:09,954
You're gonna need... this as well.

976
01:23:10,040 --> 01:23:12,713
- What is it?
- Bonner project.

977
01:23:13,560 --> 01:23:15,835
I guess that deal you made
on the concrete made all the difference.

978
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:17,592
Owen, I don't think
I can handle all that.

979
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:21,878
Lucy, you have been running
this business for the past four years.

980
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,070
There's no reason
you should stop now.

981
01:23:27,640 --> 01:23:28,959
Thank you, Owen.

982
01:24:06,280 --> 01:24:07,952
- Hey.
- Hey.

983
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:16,516
I wanted to apologize, Cal.

984
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:19,829
I put you in the middle
of something I shouldn't have, and...

985
01:24:22,160 --> 01:24:26,790
Well, I guess you figured out by now I'm...
I'm not real good with relationships.

986
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:31,356
Guess I've always known I'm...

987
01:24:33,240 --> 01:24:34,275
Well...

988
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:36,995
It's like grapefruit, right?

989
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:39,395
Where it's real nice and stuff
and people love it,

990
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:41,988
but when they're done,
what's left over is pretty ugly.

991
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:44,236
- Lucy...
- Can I finish, please?

992
01:24:44,360 --> 01:24:46,828
It's not often I feel I have something to say
or something worth listening to anyway.

993
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:49,269
Cal, can I use your phone?

994
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:53,235
Yeah.

995
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:56,118
Luce, um, you...

996
01:24:57,200 --> 01:24:58,474
Cal, it's fine.

997
01:24:59,560 --> 01:25:01,039
Really, it is.

998
01:25:02,120 --> 01:25:04,031
I just wanted to say all that.

999
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:08,717
And to say I was sorry.

1000
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,115
And that's it.

1001
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,468
Looks like it's
gonna be a pretty sunset.

1002
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:26,672
If it don't rain.

1003
01:25:27,720 --> 01:25:29,233
It's not gonna rain.

1004
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:33,231
What was the name of this wine?

1005
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:37,031
It comes in a box, Ed.
Does it really matter?

1006
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:39,273
Well, yes, it matters.

1007
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:41,157
I like it.

1008
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:43,032
And I'd like another glass.

1009
01:25:43,160 --> 01:25:45,674
And I'm sure a man in hell
would like a glass of water.

1010
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:49,395
You just quit showing out
and give me another glass of wine.

1011
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:51,511
I'm not showing out.

1012
01:25:51,640 --> 01:25:54,359
That wine is three feet
in front of your face.

1013
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:58,678
And it's been three feet
in front of your face for 55 years.

1014
01:26:01,640 --> 01:26:03,312
Get it yourself.

1015
01:26:11,080 --> 01:26:14,038
Lucy, you bring me
another glass of wine.

1016
01:26:15,038 --> 01:26:25,038
