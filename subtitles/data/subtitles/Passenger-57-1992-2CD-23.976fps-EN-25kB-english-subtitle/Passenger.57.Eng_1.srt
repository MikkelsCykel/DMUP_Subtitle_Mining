1
00:03:06,438 --> 00:03:07,857
Good morning.

2
00:03:08,107 --> 00:03:09,650
Good morning, Doctor.

3
00:03:10,067 --> 00:03:14,113
Mr. Rane, would you like one last look
at your face before I proceed?

4
00:03:14,363 --> 00:03:16,532
I never live in the past.

5
00:03:19,535 --> 00:03:20,786
No, thank you.

6
00:03:21,871 --> 00:03:24,248
I have to give you something for the pain.

7
00:03:24,248 --> 00:03:25,916
There will be no pain.

8
00:03:28,544 --> 00:03:29,461
Proceed.

9
00:03:54,403 --> 00:03:55,404
Scalpel.

10
00:04:08,042 --> 00:04:10,961
All right. You know the drill.
Be very careful.

11
00:04:11,253 --> 00:04:13,255
This is Charles Rane we're dealing with.

12
00:04:13,339 --> 00:04:15,966
- Where is he?
- Plastic Surgery. Third floor.

13
00:04:15,966 --> 00:04:17,510
He keeps changing his face.

14
00:04:17,635 --> 00:04:20,262
If we blow this,
we won't get another chance.

15
00:04:20,346 --> 00:04:21,597
Move out!

16
00:04:25,351 --> 00:04:26,810
What time is it?

17
00:04:27,019 --> 00:04:27,937
What?

18
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,689
I want you to tell me what time it is.

19
00:04:36,195 --> 00:04:37,363
Twelve o'clock.

20
00:04:42,952 --> 00:04:44,203
Get down.

21
00:05:05,057 --> 00:05:06,642
Move out there!

22
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:09,979
Stairs! Other way!

23
00:05:43,429 --> 00:05:45,431
Don't move! Freeze! Don't move!

24
00:05:47,308 --> 00:05:49,602
Charles Rane, FBI.

25
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:51,187
You're under arrest.

26
00:06:19,423 --> 00:06:21,091
Enjoy the flight.

27
00:06:37,358 --> 00:06:38,901
- There you go.
- Thanks.

28
00:06:40,069 --> 00:06:41,237
You're welcome.

29
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,574
Listen up! Shut up! Sit!

30
00:06:46,242 --> 00:06:50,412
Do as I say and nobody gets hurt.
You have the keys to the flight deck?

31
00:06:50,412 --> 00:06:53,624
We're going to move there, nice and slow.

32
00:06:53,749 --> 00:06:55,835
Don't make me use this.

33
00:06:57,169 --> 00:06:58,921
Nice and slow.

34
00:06:59,463 --> 00:07:00,840
There you go.

35
00:07:01,674 --> 00:07:02,800
Real nice.

36
00:07:03,509 --> 00:07:05,177
Real nice.

37
00:07:14,353 --> 00:07:15,729
Turn it off.

38
00:07:15,855 --> 00:07:17,189
Turn it off!

39
00:07:22,194 --> 00:07:24,071
May I ask you what you were doing?

40
00:07:24,196 --> 00:07:27,116
I was improvising
on your security techniques.

41
00:07:27,825 --> 00:07:30,202
That's cute. That's real cute, Miss...?

42
00:07:30,327 --> 00:07:32,955
Slayton, but my friends call me Marti.

43
00:07:33,122 --> 00:07:34,790
Well. See...

44
00:07:35,207 --> 00:07:39,503
...if this had been a real gun, that little
Angie Dickenson bullshit you just pulled...

45
00:07:39,628 --> 00:07:41,172
...would've got your head blown off.

46
00:07:41,172 --> 00:07:43,674
And endangered the lives
of all the other passengers.

47
00:07:43,799 --> 00:07:45,551
I was trying to save lives.

48
00:07:45,968 --> 00:07:50,055
The next time a man holds a gun
to your head on a crowded plane...

49
00:07:50,139 --> 00:07:51,599
...you follow instructions.

50
00:07:51,891 --> 00:07:56,312
You do exactly what he tells you to do.
Do you understand?

51
00:07:56,187 --> 00:07:57,730
This is why I gave up my afternoon...

52
00:07:57,855 --> 00:08:01,192
...so a former security specialist
can tell me how to obey a hijacker?

53
00:08:01,317 --> 00:08:03,569
First of all, I'm not a former anything.

54
00:08:03,903 --> 00:08:06,322
Second of all, I like what I do.

55
00:08:06,405 --> 00:08:08,908
I get the chance to meet people like you.

56
00:08:08,991 --> 00:08:13,579
I know we got a lot of information
to think about, so class dismissed.

57
00:08:13,913 --> 00:08:16,332
We'll hijack you again next week.

58
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,088
- What the hell are you doing here?
- I'm doing fine. How're you?

59
00:08:23,172 --> 00:08:24,423
What's wrong with your foot?

60
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,468
I appreciate you throwing
some business my way...

61
00:08:27,468 --> 00:08:29,845
...but you have no right
to interfere with my class.

62
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:33,307
Look around.
This is an airline training facility.

63
00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:36,227
This is not the Secret Service. Calm down.

64
00:08:36,227 --> 00:08:38,312
Now you're telling me my job, too?

65
00:08:38,437 --> 00:08:40,105
What she did was wrong. Period.

66
00:08:40,189 --> 00:08:43,442
There was a time you'd have let her know
without blowing your cool.

67
00:08:43,442 --> 00:08:46,445
It just dawned on me.
She kind of reminds me of Lisa.

68
00:08:46,362 --> 00:08:47,613
She looks nothing like Lisa.

69
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:51,242
I didn't say she looked like her,
I said she reminded me of her.

70
00:08:51,242 --> 00:08:53,452
- We gotta talk.
- I'm not interested in coming back.

71
00:08:53,536 --> 00:08:55,287
- Did I ask you to?
- You were about to.

72
00:08:55,412 --> 00:08:58,624
Don't tell me that teaching
security techniques to bodyguards...

73
00:08:58,624 --> 00:09:01,669
...watchmen, flight attendants,
is what you want to do.

74
00:09:01,794 --> 00:09:03,212
It's a job, Sly. I like it.

75
00:09:03,337 --> 00:09:05,631
Ramsey wants to hire
the best person available...

76
00:09:05,714 --> 00:09:08,467
...to head up the counter-terrorism unit.
That'd be you.

77
00:09:08,551 --> 00:09:10,135
I don't want that responsibility.

78
00:09:10,219 --> 00:09:14,056
I don't wanna be so good-looking, but
I deal with the hand that's dealt me.

79
00:09:14,056 --> 00:09:16,392
Nobody can do the job better than you.

80
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:19,728
I knew you'd start this shit again.
Give me my check.

81
00:09:19,812 --> 00:09:20,855
You want me to stop?

82
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:23,899
Just say, "Yes, I'll take the job." I'll stop.

83
00:09:23,983 --> 00:09:25,734
Dammit, Sly. Give it a rest, okay?

84
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,403
No, you give it a rest.

85
00:09:27,528 --> 00:09:30,155
This isn't about a job. This is about you.

86
00:09:30,155 --> 00:09:33,158
Nobody knows better than I do
how much Lisa meant to you...

87
00:09:33,158 --> 00:09:35,035
...but you gotta stop blaming yourself.

88
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,789
You gotta get off the sidelines
and back into this game!

89
00:09:39,415 --> 00:09:43,586
I set up a lunch tomorrow
with Ramsey at noon at The Oxford.

90
00:09:44,628 --> 00:09:46,172
I hope you'll be there.

91
00:09:46,297 --> 00:09:47,673
I really do.

92
00:10:03,814 --> 00:10:05,191
Hey, pretty boy!

93
00:10:07,151 --> 00:10:09,236
You got a pretty ass, white girl.

94
00:10:09,445 --> 00:10:10,779
What's her name?

95
00:10:25,628 --> 00:10:27,463
Attorney Phillips.

96
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:31,634
Have you found out
where they intend to take me?

97
00:10:32,051 --> 00:10:34,887
Los Angeles. But they won't say when.

98
00:10:35,095 --> 00:10:36,889
It'll happen quickly.

99
00:10:37,181 --> 00:10:39,808
Notify my people.
They'll know what to do.

100
00:10:40,309 --> 00:10:42,061
California has a death penalty.

101
00:10:42,186 --> 00:10:44,396
It's a progressive state.

102
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,899
I'll have to visit it sometime.

103
00:10:47,066 --> 00:10:49,276
The feds' witness can prove
you're responsible...

104
00:10:49,401 --> 00:10:51,362
...for two airline bombings last year.

105
00:10:51,362 --> 00:10:54,156
I'm responsible for twice that amount.

106
00:10:56,784 --> 00:11:00,746
I'm afraid the most we can hope for is
that I claim insanity for you.

107
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:05,125
Given your childhood history,
we should be able to make that stick.

108
00:11:07,211 --> 00:11:10,256
Never mention my childhood.

109
00:11:11,382 --> 00:11:13,676
Have I made myself clear?

110
00:11:14,301 --> 00:11:18,264
It is the nature of man
to confuse genius with insanity.

111
00:11:21,183 --> 00:11:22,351
Now...

112
00:11:22,768 --> 00:11:25,271
...repeat after me.

113
00:11:27,523 --> 00:11:29,191
Charles Rane...

114
00:11:30,359 --> 00:11:31,819
...is not...

115
00:11:32,111 --> 00:11:33,696
...insane.

116
00:11:36,115 --> 00:11:38,284
Charles Rane...

117
00:11:39,201 --> 00:11:41,704
...is not insane.

118
00:11:44,331 --> 00:11:45,457
Again.

119
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:48,294
Charles Rane...

120
00:11:49,044 --> 00:11:51,213
...is not insane.

121
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:54,550
Continue.

122
00:11:55,176 --> 00:11:56,218
Charles...

123
00:11:59,763 --> 00:12:01,015
...insane.

124
00:12:10,816 --> 00:12:12,985
Put some of this on the fire. Okay?

125
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:14,153
Kiss.

126
00:12:16,238 --> 00:12:17,823
Fine ass.

127
00:12:25,331 --> 00:12:26,749
Merry Christmas, motherfucker!

128
00:12:26,874 --> 00:12:28,751
Open the register. Give me money!

129
00:12:28,834 --> 00:12:32,087
Shut up! Give it to me now!
Open the register! Now!

130
00:12:32,421 --> 00:12:33,672
Freeze! Drop it!

131
00:12:37,176 --> 00:12:40,638
Get back or I'll blow her head off!
Get back!

132
00:12:40,638 --> 00:12:43,682
Get the fuck back! Put the gun down!

133
00:12:43,766 --> 00:12:45,518
Put the fucking gun down!

134
00:12:47,102 --> 00:12:49,271
All right. I'm putting it down.

135
00:12:49,396 --> 00:12:51,273
You just stay cool, all right.

136
00:12:53,025 --> 00:12:56,278
You're gonna be all right, baby.
I'm not gonna try and stop you, man.

137
00:12:56,362 --> 00:12:58,864
You shouldn't have tried to stop me
the first time.

138
00:13:07,206 --> 00:13:08,707
Oh, my God! Lisa!

139
00:13:11,627 --> 00:13:12,753
Oh, baby!

140
00:13:12,962 --> 00:13:16,215
It's going to be all right. It's not too bad.

141
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:18,884
Oh, what have I done?!

142
00:14:33,667 --> 00:14:35,044
What do you know?

143
00:14:35,127 --> 00:14:36,378
Here he is.

144
00:14:37,296 --> 00:14:39,715
- John Cutter, Stuart Ramsey.
- Pleasure.

145
00:14:39,798 --> 00:14:43,677
Nice to meet you.
Mr. Delvecchio said you might not come.

146
00:14:43,802 --> 00:14:45,763
Well, Mr. Delvecchio was wrong.

147
00:14:45,971 --> 00:14:47,306
Let's have a seat.

148
00:14:47,848 --> 00:14:52,019
Do you know how many airlines
have been hijacked in the last three years?

149
00:14:52,144 --> 00:14:53,896
- No.
- Twenty-seven.

150
00:14:54,647 --> 00:14:59,235
Almost every commercial airline in
the world has had to cope with terrorism.

151
00:14:59,735 --> 00:15:01,070
All except one.

152
00:15:01,612 --> 00:15:03,697
Israelis have never been fucked with.

153
00:15:03,822 --> 00:15:05,991
They never let them on the plane.

154
00:15:06,617 --> 00:15:08,285
Do you have thoughts on this?

155
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:12,873
Unequivocally, without a doubt,
John is the best guy I ever worked with.

156
00:15:15,584 --> 00:15:19,338
The annual meeting of our stockholders
is next week in Los Angeles.

157
00:15:19,421 --> 00:15:22,758
I'd like to fly out a couple days early,
have a brief vacation...

158
00:15:22,758 --> 00:15:25,094
...before I introduce you as...

159
00:15:25,594 --> 00:15:27,346
...our new vice-president.

160
00:15:28,097 --> 00:15:30,599
That is assuming you still want the job.

161
00:15:31,225 --> 00:15:32,685
I'll drink to that.

162
00:15:43,112 --> 00:15:46,782
When you meet this board of directors,
you should think of something really...

163
00:15:46,782 --> 00:15:50,119
...you know, impressive to say
to start things off.

164
00:15:50,202 --> 00:15:52,371
Maybe I'll ask them to fire you.

165
00:15:53,205 --> 00:15:56,041
Actually, this isn't a good time
to start with new plans.

166
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:58,627
Just be yourself: Dignified and charming.

167
00:16:00,212 --> 00:16:02,089
Sorry, sir. You'll have to go back through.

168
00:16:02,214 --> 00:16:04,300
Are you carrying any metal objects?

169
00:16:04,383 --> 00:16:07,386
Ever notice how the real suspicious ones
never have trouble?

170
00:16:07,636 --> 00:16:10,306
Right. That's how they get on the plane.

171
00:16:13,142 --> 00:16:14,393
Oh, man.

172
00:16:15,019 --> 00:16:17,521
Sorry, I'm gonna have to check you myself.

173
00:16:18,981 --> 00:16:21,901
It's that metal plate in his head.
An old war wound.

174
00:16:24,612 --> 00:16:26,697
You can go with your friend now.

175
00:16:26,822 --> 00:16:28,073
Thank you.

176
00:16:28,365 --> 00:16:29,617
You're welcome.

177
00:16:30,576 --> 00:16:32,661
Real quick. How do you do that?

178
00:16:32,953 --> 00:16:35,331
Before you get on the plane,
how do you do that?

179
00:16:35,456 --> 00:16:38,918
- It's a black thing.
- I understand black things.

180
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:41,295
That's what I admire about you.

181
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:44,757
Though you were being hit on
by an absolutely beautiful woman...

182
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,760
...you are determined to maintain
your vow of chastity.

183
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,428
You'd make a hell of a Republican.

184
00:16:49,512 --> 00:16:52,139
It is not necessary for you
to walk me to the plane.

185
00:16:52,264 --> 00:16:54,642
It's the least I can do. We're brothers.

186
00:16:55,059 --> 00:16:56,185
Have a nice flight.

187
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:59,021
I have no idea why I am so nice to you.

188
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:00,689
Look, you got me here.

189
00:17:01,023 --> 00:17:02,858
Are you satisfied? Now go.

190
00:17:04,443 --> 00:17:07,363
Come on, man.
Don't give me that sad-ass puppy look.

191
00:17:07,363 --> 00:17:10,074
I'm not giving you that.
I'm giving you the grateful...

192
00:17:10,074 --> 00:17:13,702
...deeply moved, Italian-American,
religiously inspired look, okay?

193
00:17:13,828 --> 00:17:14,662
Why?

194
00:17:14,662 --> 00:17:18,541
Even though you won't admit it, we both
know you made the right decision.

195
00:17:18,624 --> 00:17:21,335
I'm only taking this job
to make your life miserable.

196
00:17:21,335 --> 00:17:22,461
Is that right?

197
00:17:23,546 --> 00:17:25,381
This is where I get back at you.

198
00:17:25,506 --> 00:17:26,966
Speaking of which...

199
00:17:27,174 --> 00:17:28,634
...have I got a surprise for you.

200
00:17:28,843 --> 00:17:31,220
No. No surprises. What is it?

201
00:17:31,345 --> 00:17:32,388
Lips are sealed.

202
00:17:32,596 --> 00:17:35,516
- Your lips could be busted. What is it?
- Listen to this.

203
00:17:35,641 --> 00:17:39,979
When you get to Los Angeles call me,
'cause I want to hear all about it.

204
00:17:39,979 --> 00:17:41,772
Hey, are you listening to me?

205
00:17:41,772 --> 00:17:43,232
Have a pleasant trip.

206
00:17:43,566 --> 00:17:45,526
Sly, you don't understand...

207
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,905
Have a nice flight, Mr. Cutter.

208
00:18:46,128 --> 00:18:48,297
FBI. Thank you.

209
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,232
Mr. Forget?

210
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,317
"For-jhay." It's French.

211
00:19:08,734 --> 00:19:12,571
Monsieur Forget, you'll be in seat 5-C.
That's the aisle seat.

212
00:19:12,571 --> 00:19:14,073
On the left. Thanks.

213
00:19:26,252 --> 00:19:29,255
Norman, it is not polite to stare.

214
00:19:46,897 --> 00:19:49,525
May I take your coat, sir? Thank you.

215
00:19:52,736 --> 00:19:56,782
Any truth to the rumor that men in L.A.
Actually talk without cue cards?

216
00:19:56,907 --> 00:20:00,452
They talk a lot, but whether or not
they say anything is another matter.

217
00:20:00,452 --> 00:20:03,581
- I take it this is your first trip to L.A.?
- It is.

218
00:20:03,581 --> 00:20:05,875
I'm Sabrina Ritchie. How do you do?

219
00:20:06,292 --> 00:20:09,003
Marti Slayton.
Sabrina is a beautiful name.

220
00:20:09,211 --> 00:20:12,214
'Tis a thing most wondrous
to be flattered by one of your peers.

221
00:20:12,339 --> 00:20:14,216
I love the accent, too.

222
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:16,719
Between us,
I've been trying to lose it for years.

223
00:20:16,719 --> 00:20:19,013
Makes me sound cold and heartless.

224
00:20:19,138 --> 00:20:21,098
Now that you mention it...

225
00:20:22,766 --> 00:20:25,269
Always trust your first impression.

226
00:20:25,561 --> 00:20:28,063
I have a feeling
this'll be a very interesting flight.

227
00:20:28,189 --> 00:20:29,857
I certainly hope so.

228
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,902
You taken the head count yet?

229
00:20:33,402 --> 00:20:36,530
My fingers are beginning
to point as we speak.

230
00:20:37,072 --> 00:20:38,490
Champagne, madam?

231
00:21:02,681 --> 00:21:05,518
Behave yourself.
You won't get toys in prison.

232
00:21:05,851 --> 00:21:10,731
I never had any toys. My father believed
they would warp my sense of values.

233
00:21:10,856 --> 00:21:12,691
Is your father still alive?

234
00:21:13,859 --> 00:21:15,027
Died...

235
00:21:15,194 --> 00:21:16,695
...violently.

236
00:21:18,656 --> 00:21:22,409
Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight...

237
00:21:26,372 --> 00:21:28,374
54, 55, 56, 57...

238
00:21:32,419 --> 00:21:34,505
Fifty-eight, fifty-nine...

239
00:21:46,058 --> 00:21:49,645
- Can I get you anything?
- Nothing right now, thanks.

240
00:21:52,439 --> 00:21:55,359
Looks like I just found my next ex-wife.

241
00:22:03,701 --> 00:22:06,829
Make sure all carry-on items
are beneath your seats...

242
00:22:07,037 --> 00:22:09,957
...or properly stored
in an overhead compartment.

243
00:22:11,417 --> 00:22:15,379
I'm Marti. If I can do anything to make
your trip more comfortable...

244
00:22:15,588 --> 00:22:18,424
...please feel free to ask for my assistance.

245
00:22:25,181 --> 00:22:27,683
Who needs assistance this early?

246
00:22:27,892 --> 00:22:28,934
John Cutter.

247
00:22:29,018 --> 00:22:31,520
He's a security specialist for the airlines.

248
00:22:31,645 --> 00:22:33,105
Security?

249
00:22:33,439 --> 00:22:35,524
I feel safe already.

250
00:23:41,006 --> 00:23:42,007
Menu, sir?

251
00:23:45,344 --> 00:23:46,720
Menu, sir?

252
00:23:47,972 --> 00:23:49,640
Pardon me, stewardess?

253
00:23:51,851 --> 00:23:54,854
Is that man with the handcuffs dangerous?

254
00:23:56,021 --> 00:23:57,565
There's nothing to worry about, madam.

255
00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:00,192
Right now, he's as safe
as this handsome little boy.

256
00:24:00,192 --> 00:24:02,027
- What's your name?
- Norman.

257
00:24:02,278 --> 00:24:05,364
If he tries to do something bad,
I'll shoot him.

258
00:24:05,364 --> 00:24:07,032
What if he shoots back?

259
00:24:07,283 --> 00:24:11,745
I also have a secret decoder ring that
protects me from bullets and spiders...

260
00:24:11,954 --> 00:24:13,414
...but I left it at home.

261
00:24:13,414 --> 00:24:16,458
Don't worry, I've got mine
and I'll save all of us.

262
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:20,296
Give me a smile, I might get you a soda.
If that's all right with your mom.

263
00:24:20,212 --> 00:24:21,755
- Sure.
- Orange?

264
00:24:22,381 --> 00:24:23,424
You got it.

265
00:24:24,258 --> 00:24:25,301
Thank you.

266
00:24:32,057 --> 00:24:34,560
Excuse me, stewardess,
I've had that light on for a while.

267
00:24:34,685 --> 00:24:38,022
Flight attendant. If you go to your seat,
I'll bring you the peanuts.

268
00:24:38,147 --> 00:24:40,524
Actually, all I want is an aspirin.

269
00:24:41,358 --> 00:24:42,735
Here we go.

270
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:45,821
Hey, look...

271
00:24:46,655 --> 00:24:50,659
...maybe I was a little hard on you in class
but that was for your own good.

272
00:24:50,743 --> 00:24:52,828
Is this the way you apologize?

273
00:24:53,329 --> 00:24:55,331
This is gonna be a long flight.

274
00:24:55,414 --> 00:24:56,916
You've got that right.

275
00:24:57,208 --> 00:24:59,585
Excuse me. Excuse me.

276
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:03,756
Maybe you can just do me a favor?

277
00:25:04,006 --> 00:25:05,257
This oughta be good.

278
00:25:05,424 --> 00:25:08,052
I'm not all that comfortable on planes.

279
00:25:08,344 --> 00:25:10,554
There's extra pillows
in the overhead compartment.

280
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:14,850
When anything moves faster than I walk,
I'd rather be behind the wheel.

281
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:17,353
Who'd have guessed
you're a control freak?

282
00:25:17,436 --> 00:25:21,398
- You won't make this easy, will you?
- How can I make your trip more pleasant?

283
00:25:21,398 --> 00:25:25,569
I just want you to check on me
from time to time. That's it.

284
00:25:25,861 --> 00:25:28,364
Take your seat and I'll see what I can do.

285
00:25:35,579 --> 00:25:37,373
Champagne with your dinners?

286
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:42,461
Not on duty, but I'll have some
tomato juice and I'll have the chicken.

287
00:25:42,878 --> 00:25:44,213
How appropriate.

288
00:25:44,547 --> 00:25:46,131
I'll have the steak.

289
00:25:46,215 --> 00:25:49,218
Keep the champagne on ice.
We'll celebrate later.

290
00:25:55,808 --> 00:26:00,396
Sir, this is Mrs. Edwards.
She's a frequent air traveler.

291
00:26:00,479 --> 00:26:04,984
When I told her about you, she said
she'd help you feel more comfortable.

292
00:26:05,192 --> 00:26:07,403
It's a real honor to meet you.

293
00:26:08,654 --> 00:26:11,866
I take this flight once a month.
I have grandkids in Van Nuys.

294
00:26:11,866 --> 00:26:14,368
That's just outside of Los Angeles.

295
00:26:14,368 --> 00:26:17,705
Well, maybe not just outside, but hell,
Los Angeles is so spread out...

296
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:22,710
...who's to know where it begins and ends,
what's inside and outside.

297
00:26:23,335 --> 00:26:26,881
Wait till I tell everyone
I sat next to you on the plane.

298
00:26:27,006 --> 00:26:28,966
I watch your show all the time.

299
00:26:29,091 --> 00:26:31,260
- My show?
- Never miss it.

300
00:26:33,846 --> 00:26:38,976
And I love it when you do those jokes
about things that make you go, "hmmm."

301
00:26:46,483 --> 00:26:49,612
- Robert.
- I need special service in first class.

302
00:26:50,237 --> 00:26:51,697
I'll send it right up.

303
00:27:06,212 --> 00:27:09,006
I just loved it when you told off Madonna.

304
00:27:09,131 --> 00:27:12,134
Who is she to tell you
how to wear your hair?

305
00:27:12,968 --> 00:27:15,804
Excuse me, I have to go to the bathroom.

306
00:27:15,888 --> 00:27:18,474
I'll probably be in there a long time.

307
00:27:18,474 --> 00:27:20,809
Oh, I'm that way, too.

308
00:27:25,981 --> 00:27:28,400
I don't need this.

309
00:27:28,609 --> 00:27:30,819
I don't need this at all.

310
00:27:33,489 --> 00:27:35,157
Do you know the time?

311
00:27:35,407 --> 00:27:38,410
Why? You got someplace you got to go?

312
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:50,089
How do you like your sirloin, sir?

313
00:27:50,172 --> 00:27:51,549
Bloody.

314
00:27:55,511 --> 00:27:58,430
Everybody, sit down!
Be quiet and you won't get hurt!

315
00:28:15,614 --> 00:28:16,866
Who's in charge?

316
00:28:16,866 --> 00:28:17,700
I am.

317
00:28:18,868 --> 00:28:21,162
Once again. Who's in charge?

318
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:22,413
You are.

319
00:28:22,538 --> 00:28:23,539
Excellent.

320
00:28:23,956 --> 00:28:27,710
Quiet! Quiet! Sit your ass down!
Sit down!

321
00:28:28,669 --> 00:28:30,212
What the hell's that?

322
00:28:32,965 --> 00:28:36,177
Sit down, shut up or be killed!
Your choice.

323
00:28:36,302 --> 00:28:37,428
Ladies and gentlemen...

324
00:28:37,553 --> 00:28:41,182
...I'm afraid your in-flight entertainment
program has been cancelled.

325
00:28:41,182 --> 00:28:43,809
The weapons being carried
by my staff are real.

326
00:28:43,976 --> 00:28:45,477
So is their desire to use them...

327
00:28:45,644 --> 00:28:46,896
...if provoked.

328
00:28:46,896 --> 00:28:50,774
I'm prepared to do whatever is necessary
in order to achieve my goal.

329
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:53,903
If you do as instructed,
you will not be harmed.

330
00:28:54,236 --> 00:28:56,906
If you disobey or interfere
with their activities...

331
00:28:57,031 --> 00:28:58,908
...you will be shot.

332
00:29:02,661 --> 00:29:03,996
Oh, man.

333
00:29:17,676 --> 00:29:19,345
All right, all right.

334
00:29:19,845 --> 00:29:21,931
This is your idea of surprise?

335
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:25,518
Very funny, Sly. You better be there.

336
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,759
No, no, no. This can't be happening.
Not now.

337
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:03,764
First this Arsenio shit, then this.

338
00:30:10,646 --> 00:30:12,523
Come on, come on.

339
00:30:12,648 --> 00:30:16,277
Hello. I got an emergency.
My name is John Cutter.

340
00:30:20,447 --> 00:30:22,533
I need Sly Delvecchio.

341
00:30:22,741 --> 00:30:26,579
I don't know how to spell his name.
D-E-L-vecchio.

342
00:30:26,579 --> 00:30:30,583
- Gary's compiled those numbers and...
- There's a call for you.

343
00:30:30,666 --> 00:30:31,709
Excuse me.

344
00:30:34,086 --> 00:30:35,588
- Who is it?
- John Cutter.

345
00:30:35,754 --> 00:30:37,131
Great.

346
00:30:40,467 --> 00:30:41,427
Shit.

347
00:30:41,594 --> 00:30:42,428
Cutter?

348
00:30:45,264 --> 00:30:47,266
You! Back to your seat.

349
00:30:47,266 --> 00:30:50,060
Please don't shoot me!
I don't want to die!

350
00:30:50,186 --> 00:30:52,980
I said, back to your seat!

351
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:55,357
They've taken over the plane!

352
00:30:57,026 --> 00:30:59,945
Get everybody up here
for an emergency meeting, now!

353
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:02,031
They've taken over the plane!

354
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:20,299
How many? How many?

355
00:31:20,508 --> 00:31:22,593
Let's say hello to your friends.

356
00:31:24,803 --> 00:31:26,138
All right, freeze!

357
00:31:26,472 --> 00:31:28,224
Drop the fucking gun, or your friend dies.

358
00:31:28,307 --> 00:31:29,683
I have no friends.

359
00:31:30,309 --> 00:31:33,020
His name's John Cutter.
He's airline security.

360
00:31:33,145 --> 00:31:37,316
I'm sure your superiors would not like you
to do anything rash...

361
00:31:37,191 --> 00:31:40,736
...and risk the lives
of all these wonderful people.

362
00:31:40,819 --> 00:31:42,738
Stand up! Move!

363
00:31:49,078 --> 00:31:53,040
Airline personnel assume a certain risk,
it's part of the job.

364
00:31:53,332 --> 00:31:54,917
But these passengers...

365
00:31:55,125 --> 00:31:56,585
...they're so innocent.

366
00:31:56,585 --> 00:31:57,837
What do you want?

367
00:31:58,879 --> 00:32:03,592
I have what I want. I have control
of the plane and everything on it.

368
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:05,970
Must I prove that to you?

369
00:32:07,638 --> 00:32:08,764
Sir...

370
00:32:09,431 --> 00:32:12,101
...tell Mr. Cutter your name.

371
00:32:12,768 --> 00:32:13,894
Douglas.

372
00:32:14,436 --> 00:32:15,855
Cutter, meet Douglas.

373
00:32:16,105 --> 00:32:17,231
Let him go.

374
00:32:17,439 --> 00:32:20,150
Do you have any children, Douglas?

375
00:32:20,568 --> 00:32:21,944
A daughter.

376
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:24,613
A family man.

377
00:32:25,156 --> 00:32:27,241
He has a daughter who loves him.

378
00:32:27,449 --> 00:32:31,203
And she, until your interference,
had a father.

379
00:32:37,251 --> 00:32:38,919
Drop the fucking gun.

380
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:50,055
I loathe incompetence.

381
00:32:56,645 --> 00:32:57,897
Elevator!

382
00:33:12,578 --> 00:33:14,663
Who are you? What're you doing?

383
00:33:14,788 --> 00:33:16,457
There's always someone here.

384
00:33:16,665 --> 00:33:20,503
I just get paid to send food upstairs.
Give me a break.

385
00:33:20,628 --> 00:33:24,798
All right. Look,
we got a hijack situation upstairs, okay?

386
00:33:24,924 --> 00:33:27,092
I need your help. Anything.

387
00:33:29,094 --> 00:33:33,265
I'm not risking my life.
You'll have to fight terrorists on your own.

388
00:33:33,349 --> 00:33:35,643
Give me a knife or a screwdriver.

389
00:33:41,357 --> 00:33:44,527
I think we should do exactly
what Mr. Rane wants.

390
00:34:03,045 --> 00:34:04,004
Come on!

391
00:34:13,806 --> 00:34:15,140
You got to go.

392
00:34:20,271 --> 00:34:23,607
See if you can find something
to tie him up with.

393
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:27,987
Notify the feds and radar.
Don't let the plane out of sight!

394
00:34:27,987 --> 00:34:30,906
Let me know the minute
you contact the pilot.

395
00:34:30,990 --> 00:34:33,325
Notify ATC about our situation.

396
00:34:33,492 --> 00:34:38,414
I want a complete passenger list.
I want it five minutes ago! Get to work!

397
00:34:59,685 --> 00:35:00,102
- So what's the plan?
- Go to the avionics compartment.

398
00:35:02,605 --> 00:35:05,524
Then I can override the controls
and bring the plane down.

399
00:35:05,733 --> 00:35:07,943
What?! This is a jumbo jet!

400
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:11,155
I know it. But we don't have any choice.

401
00:35:15,034 --> 00:35:17,536
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but wasn't it you who said...

402
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:19,788
...to do exactly what the terrorists said?

403
00:35:19,914 --> 00:35:21,373
He's not just a terrorist.

404
00:35:21,582 --> 00:35:24,793
- How you gonna bring the plane down?
- I'll empty the fuel.

405
00:35:26,462 --> 00:35:28,964
Are you out of your mind?
We could all crash!

406
00:35:28,964 --> 00:35:31,050
- Exactly.
- No! I won't let you do that!

407
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,677
It's too dangerous! You're certifiable!

408
00:35:33,802 --> 00:35:35,888
Damn it, Lisa! I'm tired of this shit!

409
00:35:35,888 --> 00:35:39,391
That man is one of
the most dangerous terrorists in the world.

410
00:35:39,308 --> 00:35:40,643
He has killed two people.

411
00:35:40,893 --> 00:35:45,648
He will kill everybody else on this
fucking plane if I don't bring him down.

412
00:35:46,899 --> 00:35:49,235
Look, I need your help.

413
00:35:50,486 --> 00:35:51,821
Please.

414
00:35:52,154 --> 00:35:53,989
Tell me you're good at this.

415
00:35:54,657 --> 00:35:55,991
I'm the best.

416
00:35:58,911 --> 00:36:00,246
Then do it.

417
00:36:10,506 --> 00:36:13,175
Charles Rane,
the sophisticated British aristocrat...

418
00:36:13,175 --> 00:36:15,511
...known internationally as
"The Rane of Terror."

419
00:36:15,594 --> 00:36:18,013
He's linked to bombings
in London and Ireland...

420
00:36:18,097 --> 00:36:21,433
...but because of his ties
to the Middle East, he's been untouchable.

421
00:36:21,433 --> 00:36:25,187
Judging from the fact he killed his father,
he was a sick kid, too.

422
00:36:25,187 --> 00:36:26,856
What his old man did to him...

423
00:36:27,064 --> 00:36:30,609
...didn't exactly qualify him
for father of the year honors.

424
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:33,863
You let the feds put a terrorist
on one of my planes?

425
00:36:33,863 --> 00:36:36,949
- They didn't notify me. Here's his file.
- They can do that?

426
00:36:37,074 --> 00:36:40,202
The FBI shows up at the last minute,
takes what seats they need...

427
00:36:40,202 --> 00:36:42,288
They don't have to notify us.
They're the FBI!

428
00:36:42,371 --> 00:36:46,792
Jesus Christ. You'd think they'd put
an airline hijacker on a bus or a train.

429
00:36:46,959 --> 00:36:49,378
Why were they taking him to Los Angeles?

430
00:36:49,461 --> 00:36:53,340
He was supposed to stand trial
for the Trans Pacific bombing last year.

431
00:36:53,215 --> 00:36:55,217
Guess he had different plans.

432
00:36:55,634 --> 00:36:57,303
He'll have to change them again.

433
00:36:57,303 --> 00:36:58,220
Why?

434
00:36:58,345 --> 00:36:59,889
Cutter's on the plane.

435
00:37:20,743 --> 00:37:22,119
What's the problem?

436
00:37:22,119 --> 00:37:25,664
We're losing fuel.
One way or another, we're going down.

437
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:28,918
Then you'd better make preparations
to land.

438
00:37:30,878 --> 00:37:32,421
Why are we going back?

439
00:37:32,838 --> 00:37:35,591
- It's easier to jump off from the rear.
- What?

440
00:37:35,758 --> 00:37:38,511
It's easier to jump off from the rear.

441
00:37:45,351 --> 00:37:47,770
I think they're preparing to land.

442
00:37:47,853 --> 00:37:51,023
- Where is it?
- Outside Lake Lucille, Louisiana.

443
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:55,486
The airfield there may not be large enough,
but it may be their only choice.

444
00:37:56,111 --> 00:37:59,365
- How fast can we get a chopper there?
- Chopper? Why?

445
00:37:59,448 --> 00:38:01,116
I want you there as quickly as possible.

446
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,993
You mean on a helicopter?

447
00:38:03,118 --> 00:38:06,205
I don't want the FBI or
some country local talking to the press...

448
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:08,415
...about what's affecting this airline.

449
00:38:08,415 --> 00:38:10,626
Get out there and keep me informed.

450
00:38:22,054 --> 00:38:25,808
Atlantic International Flight 163.
We're declaring an emergency.

451
00:38:25,933 --> 00:38:28,227
Request immediate authorization to land.

452
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:32,481
Negative, 163. We're not a commercial
airport. Suggest you re-route.

453
00:38:32,898 --> 00:38:34,400
Suggestion refused.

454
00:38:34,817 --> 00:38:38,737
Repeat, 163. We're not equipped
to handle an aircraft your size.

455
00:38:38,863 --> 00:38:41,365
- It's too dangerous...
- Shut up and listen.

456
00:38:41,574 --> 00:38:45,411
It is too dangerous for you.
See that the runway is cleared.

457
00:38:46,996 --> 00:38:49,832
Call Atlantic International.
See what the hell is going on.

458
00:38:49,832 --> 00:38:52,084
Call the hospital, too, just in case.

459
00:39:12,938 --> 00:39:14,315
Who's Lisa?

460
00:39:15,691 --> 00:39:16,692
What?

461
00:39:16,817 --> 00:39:19,945
Lisa. You called me Lisa
in the avionics compartment.

462
00:39:23,491 --> 00:39:24,950
She was my wife.

463
00:39:25,284 --> 00:39:26,535
Was?

464
00:39:27,453 --> 00:39:30,164
She was with me
when I tried to stop a robbery.

465
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:32,875
I lived.

466
00:39:36,128 --> 00:39:37,463
I'm sorry.

467
00:39:49,642 --> 00:39:50,309
Plan not working out...

468
00:39:50,601 --> 00:39:52,394
...the way you wanted, asshole?

469
00:39:52,478 --> 00:39:55,481
Don't flatter yourself.
You prevented nothing.

470
00:39:55,814 --> 00:39:58,400
Although it seems
I may have underestimated you.

471
00:39:58,526 --> 00:40:00,903
Dumping the fuel was quite ingenious.

472
00:40:01,237 --> 00:40:04,907
At least Mr. Douglas's body
won't have quite so far to fall.

473
00:40:05,825 --> 00:40:09,078
Maybe Vincent could hitch a ride with him
on his way down.

474
00:40:09,245 --> 00:40:11,580
You know, Charlie,
I'm a little surprised at you.

475
00:40:11,664 --> 00:40:15,334
Didn't your father teach you
never to send a boy to do a man's job?

476
00:40:16,335 --> 00:40:17,711
Speaking of boys...

477
00:40:18,254 --> 00:40:21,757
...our stewardess friend must be feeling
particularly unsatisfied.

478
00:40:22,091 --> 00:40:24,593
Charlie, you ever play roulette?

479
00:40:24,677 --> 00:40:25,928
On occasion.

480
00:40:26,053 --> 00:40:28,013
Let me give you a word of advice.

481
00:40:29,598 --> 00:40:30,933
Always bet on black.

482
00:40:36,897 --> 00:40:38,774
Mr. Delvecchio, are you okay?

483
00:40:38,983 --> 00:40:41,360
Could you please close the door?

484
00:40:41,694 --> 00:40:43,154
The door is closed.

485
00:40:43,279 --> 00:40:46,782
Do you want us to fly higher?
It might be a little smoother up there.

486
00:40:49,285 --> 00:40:50,786
This is fine.

487
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:52,746
This is fine.

488
00:41:06,802 --> 00:41:09,638
You better buckle up.
The landing's gonna be rough.

489
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,985
Let me give you a hand.

490
00:41:45,841 --> 00:41:48,093
Biggest damn Cessna I ever saw!

491
00:41:48,344 --> 00:41:51,138
Get somebody out on the runway.
I'll be in the tower.

492
00:41:51,263 --> 00:41:53,516
Patrick, just do something.

493
00:41:57,186 --> 00:41:58,771
Please fasten your seat belts.

494
00:41:58,771 --> 00:42:01,148
Brace yourselves for a short field landing.

495
00:42:01,273 --> 00:42:05,194
Flight attendants, take your positions
for an emergency landing.

496
00:42:41,188 --> 00:42:45,484
The tower's going to need
as much assistance as they can get.

497
00:42:45,901 --> 00:42:49,655
You communicate with the airline staff,
I'll coordinate rescue on the ground.

498
00:42:49,738 --> 00:42:51,740
How do we get down there?

499
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:54,410
We step out. Gravity'll do the rest.

500
00:42:58,414 --> 00:43:00,374
As soon as it stops, we jump.

501
00:43:28,194 --> 00:43:30,946
Mr. Delvecchio,
I've got Mr. Ramsey on the line.

502
00:43:32,615 --> 00:43:35,618
I guess we can't tell him I stepped out,
now, can we?

503
00:43:36,368 --> 00:43:38,329
Put him through.

504
00:43:40,706 --> 00:43:43,209
I just had an idea about how to use Cutter.

505
00:43:43,459 --> 00:43:44,376
"Use"?

506
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:47,213
If this works you're to tell the press...

507
00:43:47,296 --> 00:43:51,383
...we had a security agent on the plane
as part of our anti-terrorist plan.

508
00:43:51,383 --> 00:43:54,386
If it doesn't work out,
don't tell them about Cutter.

509
00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:56,055
I'll handle that. Understand?
