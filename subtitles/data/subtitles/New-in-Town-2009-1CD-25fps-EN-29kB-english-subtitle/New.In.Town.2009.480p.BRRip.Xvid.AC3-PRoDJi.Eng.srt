1
00:01:03,573 --> 00:01:05,613
Oh, I bet you that's Trudy right now.

2
00:01:05,813 --> 00:01:07,773
Harve, would you get that?

3
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:12,534
Harve, get that, will you?

4
00:01:13,414 --> 00:01:15,454
<i>To the 35, 40. What a block.</i>

5
00:01:15,694 --> 00:01:17,895
<i>Forty-five, still going.
Brought down at the 50.</i>

6
00:01:18,095 --> 00:01:21,215
Okay, buster, no tapioca for you.

7
00:01:21,735 --> 00:01:23,135
- Hey, everybody.
- Hi.

8
00:01:23,335 --> 00:01:24,255
Hi, Trudy.

9
00:01:24,455 --> 00:01:27,176
I froze my patootie off waiting
for someone to open that door.

10
00:01:27,376 --> 00:01:30,016
You know how those New Ulm men
get when the Vikings play.

11
00:01:30,216 --> 00:01:33,737
- Yeah, I know.
- So, Trudy, I've got cocoa, tea or cider.

12
00:01:33,937 --> 00:01:34,937
Cider. Thank you.

13
00:01:35,137 --> 00:01:37,177
So, what's the latest?

14
00:01:37,377 --> 00:01:39,897
You girls are terrible.
You start right in on that gossip.

15
00:01:40,097 --> 00:01:41,417
It's not gossip, it's news.

16
00:01:41,617 --> 00:01:43,578
Yes, Blanche, it's news.

17
00:01:43,778 --> 00:01:44,978
So spit it out.

18
00:01:45,178 --> 00:01:47,818
The reason I was late
is because I just got off the phone...

19
00:01:48,018 --> 00:01:51,339
...with Munck headquarters in Miami.
- What did they want?

20
00:01:51,499 --> 00:01:54,699
To rent a house for the new
plant manager they're sending here.

21
00:01:54,859 --> 00:01:56,459
- No way.
- Yes way.

22
00:01:56,619 --> 00:01:59,019
We remember what happened
to that last plant manager...

23
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:01,100
...that Stu and his fellas
ran out of town.

24
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,220
The one that choked
on the knackwurst...

25
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,220
...during the Braunschweiger
competition?

26
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:08,861
Or what about the manager Stu had
stand too close to the glockenspiel?

27
00:02:09,061 --> 00:02:10,941
You know I heard
he still has tinnitus?

28
00:02:11,141 --> 00:02:13,981
- What's that?
- Well, it's like:

29
00:02:24,382 --> 00:02:27,023
All day long for the rest of your life.

30
00:02:27,183 --> 00:02:28,623
Oh, my God, that's horrible.

31
00:02:28,823 --> 00:02:30,583
Don't forget
the Land O' Lakes manager...

32
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:33,303
...that mysteriously got locked into
the dairy cooler.

33
00:02:33,743 --> 00:02:36,944
What that man had to do
in that cooler to survive...

34
00:02:37,144 --> 00:02:38,304
It's unmentionable.

35
00:02:39,504 --> 00:02:43,385
God bless our new plant manager
whoever the poor guy is.

36
00:02:43,585 --> 00:02:44,545
Amen.

37
00:02:44,745 --> 00:02:46,105
Amen.

38
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:42,431
Good morning. Munck Foods.

39
00:03:47,832 --> 00:03:48,992
Sorry I'm late.

40
00:03:49,192 --> 00:03:51,993
- We haven't gotten far.
- We had to wait for you.

41
00:03:53,873 --> 00:03:56,233
We were discussing
how getting the New Ulm facility...

42
00:03:56,433 --> 00:03:59,673
...dumped on our division
is going to affect our bottom line.

43
00:03:59,834 --> 00:04:02,234
Well, wouldn't it just be better
to close the plant?

44
00:04:02,394 --> 00:04:03,994
It looks like a lost cause to me.

45
00:04:04,194 --> 00:04:07,994
Yes, but Marketing wants to cross
our branding in the youth demo...

46
00:04:08,154 --> 00:04:12,555
...with the adult protein craze with
Rocket Bars, protein snacks for kids.

47
00:04:12,755 --> 00:04:14,475
Now, we can use
the existing facility...

48
00:04:14,675 --> 00:04:17,236
...but we'll have to automate it
to produce the new line...

49
00:04:17,436 --> 00:04:20,956
...downsize production,
reduce the workforce by 50 percent.

50
00:04:21,116 --> 00:04:23,396
The question is, who will oversee it?

51
00:04:27,677 --> 00:04:29,357
Don't all of you volunteer at once.

52
00:04:35,078 --> 00:04:36,318
I can do it.

53
00:04:37,038 --> 00:04:40,078
And, hey, Lucy's single.
She could do the conversion on-site.

54
00:04:40,278 --> 00:04:42,678
- That's not in the proposal.
- On-site would expedite it.

55
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,159
You'll go immediately.

56
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:47,079
Joan, book Lucy to Minnesota
this weekend.

57
00:04:47,679 --> 00:04:49,519
This...? Minnesota?

58
00:04:49,719 --> 00:04:50,879
Knew I could count on you.

59
00:05:24,843 --> 00:05:27,564
- Can I give you a hand with that?
- Oh, I've got it. Thank you.

60
00:05:27,764 --> 00:05:28,964
All right.

61
00:06:11,369 --> 00:06:13,209
How bad can it be?

62
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:25,730
Holy mother...

63
00:06:25,931 --> 00:06:28,931
<i>Traveling on Flight 116
to New Orleans.</i>

64
00:06:29,131 --> 00:06:31,411
<i>Flight 116.</i>

65
00:07:10,536 --> 00:07:13,296
I'm spending winter in a theme park.

66
00:07:30,738 --> 00:07:32,898
Okay.

67
00:07:36,339 --> 00:07:40,099
Oh, my Lord,
locked the door at 5 out of habit.

68
00:07:41,539 --> 00:07:44,180
Can we help you?

69
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,020
Yeah, I'm looking
for Blanche Gunderson.

70
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,940
My assistant, Cathy, called.

71
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,380
You must be Miss Hill.

72
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,181
I'm Blanche Gunderson.

73
00:07:52,941 --> 00:07:55,221
You're my executive assistant?

74
00:07:55,381 --> 00:07:56,421
Oh, heavens, no.

75
00:07:56,621 --> 00:07:57,581
I'm just a secretary.

76
00:07:57,781 --> 00:07:59,541
Did you need me to find you
one of those?

77
00:08:00,341 --> 00:08:01,262
We'll see.

78
00:08:01,462 --> 00:08:03,262
What you need to find
is a place to live.

79
00:08:03,462 --> 00:08:06,822
Right. So this is your realtor, Trudy.

80
00:08:07,022 --> 00:08:08,462
Trudy Van Uuden at your service.

81
00:08:08,662 --> 00:08:10,903
That's with two U's.
A double U, not a W.

82
00:08:12,183 --> 00:08:14,623
I'll drive. What do you say
you follow with Ms. Hill?

83
00:08:14,823 --> 00:08:16,263
Oh, good idea.

84
00:08:17,624 --> 00:08:18,984
Oh, your luggage all matches.

85
00:08:19,184 --> 00:08:20,984
That's so nice.

86
00:08:24,784 --> 00:08:26,425
Say cheese.

87
00:08:30,425 --> 00:08:31,625
Are you a scrapper?

88
00:08:31,825 --> 00:08:32,785
Excuse me?

89
00:08:32,985 --> 00:08:34,305
Oh, there's Merle. Hey, Merle.

90
00:08:35,706 --> 00:08:37,706
That's our mailman, Merle.

91
00:08:37,906 --> 00:08:39,666
That's what we call him.
Mailman Merle.

92
00:08:39,866 --> 00:08:43,186
Because he delivers the mail,
and he's our mailman.

93
00:08:43,386 --> 00:08:46,067
So, you know?

94
00:08:47,587 --> 00:08:49,187
Oh, yeah,
do you keep a scrapbook?

95
00:08:49,787 --> 00:08:50,787
Because I do.

96
00:08:50,987 --> 00:08:52,068
I'm a scrapper, see.

97
00:08:52,268 --> 00:08:54,108
We even got a club.

98
00:08:54,268 --> 00:08:56,228
I got a mini in my bag here.

99
00:08:57,468 --> 00:09:01,349
Okay, so this here is our dog,
Winston Churchill.

100
00:09:01,549 --> 00:09:03,869
He's dead.
He was a bit of drooler, I'm afraid.

101
00:09:05,229 --> 00:09:07,029
And this here is my kitty, Snowflake.

102
00:09:07,229 --> 00:09:08,389
She's dead too.

103
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:12,190
We had to put her down
on account of that kitty-leukemia thing.

104
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:16,030
You should've seen the kinds of things
she was barfing up on our couch.

105
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:17,951
Poor thing. Bless her heart.

106
00:09:18,951 --> 00:09:21,471
She's not dead in the picture though.
She's just sleeping.

107
00:09:21,671 --> 00:09:25,751
Could I look at that later maybe?

108
00:09:25,951 --> 00:09:27,192
Okay?

109
00:09:28,152 --> 00:09:29,352
So...

110
00:09:31,872 --> 00:09:33,672
Are you married?
Do you have children?

111
00:09:33,872 --> 00:09:35,353
No, no. I'm not married.

112
00:09:35,553 --> 00:09:37,753
Oh, you're still young, you know?

113
00:09:37,953 --> 00:09:38,913
Relatively.

114
00:09:39,633 --> 00:09:44,114
I mean, you still got time, I suppose.

115
00:09:45,714 --> 00:09:48,274
Do you eat meat, or are you one
of those vegetarian people?

116
00:09:48,474 --> 00:09:50,994
No. I'm not a vegetarian.

117
00:09:51,194 --> 00:09:54,195
- Why?
- Because it's your first night in town.

118
00:09:54,395 --> 00:09:56,675
Don't think we're gonna let you
go hungry.

119
00:09:56,875 --> 00:10:00,115
You're coming to my house for dinner.
Nothing fancy, of course.

120
00:10:00,315 --> 00:10:02,156
Meatloaf.

121
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:08,916
Do you mind
if I ask you a personal question?

122
00:10:10,397 --> 00:10:13,757
Isn't that what you've been doing?

123
00:10:15,917 --> 00:10:16,917
Have you found Jesus?

124
00:10:20,158 --> 00:10:22,798
Well, I didn't know he was missing.

125
00:10:34,199 --> 00:10:35,880
It was just a joke.

126
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,920
Normally we don't joke
about Jesus around here.

127
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,801
But I can see how you'd think
that was sort of funny.

128
00:10:45,961 --> 00:10:48,561
Imagine Jesus gone missing.

129
00:10:49,641 --> 00:10:51,161
Imagine.

130
00:11:10,124 --> 00:11:11,484
It's clearing. Chill coming on.

131
00:11:11,684 --> 00:11:13,524
It's gonna get a heck of a lot colder.

132
00:11:13,724 --> 00:11:16,364
This place is big, but what the hey.

133
00:11:17,324 --> 00:11:19,485
Colder?

134
00:11:20,845 --> 00:11:23,605
It gets colder?

135
00:11:23,805 --> 00:11:24,765
Oh, yeah.

136
00:11:28,806 --> 00:11:30,166
Oh, good. Electric is still on.

137
00:11:30,366 --> 00:11:32,366
Heat's LP. Tank's out back.
Furnace is a Norge.

138
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:34,606
The pipes are wrapped.
Windows are two-paned.

139
00:11:34,806 --> 00:11:36,847
And there's a double layer
of Owens Corning.

140
00:11:37,047 --> 00:11:40,327
Hardwood. You got rugs to keep from
freezing the bejesus out of your toes.

141
00:11:40,527 --> 00:11:42,087
Wait, you just lost me.

142
00:11:42,287 --> 00:11:43,727
No problem. What didn't you get?

143
00:11:43,887 --> 00:11:46,528
Well, I understood
that the electric is still on.

144
00:11:51,808 --> 00:11:53,889
- Does that work?
- Oh, sure as shooting.

145
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:55,809
Okay. Then I'll take it.

146
00:11:56,009 --> 00:11:57,449
Want me to go over the fireplace?

147
00:11:57,649 --> 00:12:00,889
No, I'm a city girl,
but I know how to light a fire.

148
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:02,770
Where's the switch?

149
00:12:10,811 --> 00:12:12,931
She seems nice enough.

150
00:12:13,131 --> 00:12:15,971
I doubt she'll last a week.
Poor thing.

151
00:12:25,572 --> 00:12:28,293
There you are.
I was starting to wonder.

152
00:12:28,493 --> 00:12:29,893
I got lost.

153
00:12:30,093 --> 00:12:32,253
You said it was around
the other side of the lake.

154
00:12:32,453 --> 00:12:34,373
Every direction I went,
there was a lake.

155
00:12:34,573 --> 00:12:36,614
That's not even a lake.
That's Luden Pond.

156
00:12:36,814 --> 00:12:38,454
I turned around.
I found another lake.

157
00:12:38,654 --> 00:12:41,494
Oh, I bet you went
to Van Meyer Slough.

158
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:44,135
- And then I went left.
- That's actually a stone quarry.

159
00:12:44,335 --> 00:12:46,135
But you made it.

160
00:12:46,455 --> 00:12:47,895
Yeah.

161
00:12:50,855 --> 00:12:53,856
Oh, Harve, company.

162
00:12:54,056 --> 00:12:56,776
I didn't know whether
to get red or white.

163
00:12:57,536 --> 00:13:01,056
But all they had
was Zinfandel anyway, so...

164
00:13:01,257 --> 00:13:06,137
Oh, hell, anything you can uncork,
uncap or unscrew, I'll drink it.

165
00:13:06,657 --> 00:13:10,938
This is my husband, Harve.
You'd think he's joking, but he's not.

166
00:13:11,138 --> 00:13:13,498
- Take your coat?
- Yes. Please.

167
00:13:13,698 --> 00:13:15,338
That would be great.

168
00:13:16,538 --> 00:13:17,898
Thank you.

169
00:13:22,619 --> 00:13:25,259
You okay like that?
You're not too cold?

170
00:13:25,459 --> 00:13:26,419
No. I'm fine.

171
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,100
Oh, okay,
because you look a little cold.

172
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,060
I'm fine.

173
00:13:40,421 --> 00:13:43,061
Anyhow, there's someone
that I want you to meet.

174
00:13:43,261 --> 00:13:44,622
I'm hoping that you hit it off.

175
00:13:44,822 --> 00:13:49,342
If you do, it's gonna make your stay
here in Minnesota a lot more pleasant.

176
00:13:50,382 --> 00:13:54,463
So, Lucy Hill, this is Ted Mitchell.

177
00:13:56,103 --> 00:13:57,503
Damn.

178
00:13:57,783 --> 00:13:58,783
Damn.

179
00:13:58,983 --> 00:14:01,864
- Oh, so it's a whole dinner party.
- Oh, yeah.

180
00:14:02,064 --> 00:14:03,264
Lovely. Thank you.

181
00:14:03,424 --> 00:14:04,984
How you doing?

182
00:14:05,504 --> 00:14:08,784
You've got beer dripping
from your chin.

183
00:14:09,264 --> 00:14:11,585
- Awesome.
- Can I use your powder room?

184
00:14:11,745 --> 00:14:14,705
You betcha. It's right through
the kitchen to the right.

185
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:37,068
- Yeah?
- Lucy, we thought we'd open...

186
00:14:37,268 --> 00:14:39,428
...that wine with dinner.
Would you like a glass?

187
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:40,748
Yeah, that would be great.

188
00:14:40,948 --> 00:14:43,868
You know,
I actually am feeling a little chilly.

189
00:14:44,068 --> 00:14:45,549
Would you mind
bringing my jacket?

190
00:14:45,749 --> 00:14:47,269
Oh, you betcha.

191
00:14:48,989 --> 00:14:50,149
God.

192
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:00,110
- Blanche, this meatloaf is good.
- Oh, thank you, Ted.

193
00:15:10,151 --> 00:15:12,392
So, Ted, do you live around here?

194
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:16,232
Yeah.

195
00:15:16,552 --> 00:15:18,032
Yeah, I moved up here.

196
00:15:18,232 --> 00:15:19,473
Little over 10 years ago.

197
00:15:20,193 --> 00:15:21,153
Why?

198
00:15:22,473 --> 00:15:24,833
I mean, not that it's not nice.
I'm sure.

199
00:15:25,033 --> 00:15:26,193
But why?

200
00:15:28,074 --> 00:15:29,914
Why not, you know?

201
00:15:32,674 --> 00:15:34,074
What's so great about a city?

202
00:15:34,914 --> 00:15:38,915
Well, I mean,
the cultural advantages alone.

203
00:15:39,115 --> 00:15:43,195
Museums, opera, ballet, theater.
Not to mention nightlife.

204
00:15:43,395 --> 00:15:45,036
Oh, yeah.

205
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:48,316
Do you know I was in a restaurant,
and Justin Timberlake walked in?

206
00:15:48,516 --> 00:15:51,836
- For real?
- Is he one of your MP3 fellas?

207
00:15:52,396 --> 00:15:54,317
Oh, that's nice.

208
00:15:54,517 --> 00:15:56,597
I thought all they had
was skinny supermodels...

209
00:15:56,797 --> 00:15:58,037
...and Colombian drug lords.

210
00:15:58,797 --> 00:16:01,157
Ted, that's terrible.

211
00:16:02,198 --> 00:16:04,438
You know who else was there,
Bobbie?

212
00:16:05,358 --> 00:16:06,358
Fergie.

213
00:16:06,558 --> 00:16:08,078
I bet you like her music, huh?

214
00:16:08,278 --> 00:16:10,399
My dad won't let me like that stuff.

215
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:14,159
Well, you seem old enough
to decide for yourself what you like.

216
00:16:14,319 --> 00:16:15,879
Excuse me?

217
00:16:16,319 --> 00:16:19,760
Women like that just selling
themselves as sex objects?

218
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,120
What kind of a role model is that
for young girls?

219
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,241
I think that any examples of strong
successful young women are vital.

220
00:16:28,401 --> 00:16:32,321
And that's how you measure success?
By how provocative a woman can be?

221
00:16:32,521 --> 00:16:34,401
We'll pass on that.
We'll listen to country.

222
00:16:34,601 --> 00:16:37,122
Oh, the twangy drivel
about the losers who drink beer...

223
00:16:37,322 --> 00:16:39,042
...and drive pickup trucks?

224
00:16:39,242 --> 00:16:40,642
Yeah.

225
00:16:41,962 --> 00:16:44,963
How about polka?
It's got something for everybody.

226
00:16:45,163 --> 00:16:47,283
That's it, Harve,
you're exactly right. Bingo.

227
00:16:48,843 --> 00:16:50,003
I like beer.

228
00:16:51,563 --> 00:16:53,083
I drive a pickup.

229
00:16:55,484 --> 00:16:57,204
I should have known.

230
00:17:03,485 --> 00:17:06,365
You probably drive a new car
for what it says about you...

231
00:17:06,565 --> 00:17:08,005
...when what it says about you...

232
00:17:08,205 --> 00:17:11,446
...is how you bow down to the big
corporations that made a gravy train.

233
00:17:11,606 --> 00:17:13,926
And would anybody like
more gravy?

234
00:17:14,126 --> 00:17:15,086
Trudy? Kimberley?

235
00:17:15,286 --> 00:17:18,726
Industrial competition in a free-market
economy is what built this country.

236
00:17:18,926 --> 00:17:22,367
No, robber barons built it, and they
did it from the blood of working folks.

237
00:17:22,567 --> 00:17:24,967
If you steal somebody's car,
you get thrown in jail.

238
00:17:25,167 --> 00:17:27,447
If you steal life savings,
you get to be a CEO.

239
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:29,128
I'm planning on being a CEO.

240
00:17:29,328 --> 00:17:31,808
You better count the silverware
before she leaves.

241
00:17:32,008 --> 00:17:34,008
- I'm leaving now.
- Not if I leave first.

242
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:36,689
- Come on, baby.
- I've got Snickerdoodles with tapioca.

243
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,649
- Thanks for dinner.
- Thanks for dinner.

244
00:17:42,489 --> 00:17:44,649
Totally awesome.

245
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:13,780
Miss Hill.

246
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,820
Stu Kopenhafer, plant foreman.

247
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,580
I'm supposed to show you around.

248
00:19:27,261 --> 00:19:29,782
Milk processors, cooking facilities.

249
00:19:29,982 --> 00:19:32,342
Curdling vats, slop sinks...

250
00:19:32,542 --> 00:19:35,142
...auxiliary refrigeration,
more slop sinks.

251
00:19:35,622 --> 00:19:36,983
Storage racks over there.

252
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:41,103
Conveyor belt.
This is your main production floor.

253
00:19:41,903 --> 00:19:44,503
I'd really like to speak
with the workers.

254
00:19:44,703 --> 00:19:46,744
Where can I do that?

255
00:19:51,304 --> 00:19:52,424
Bob.

256
00:20:00,105 --> 00:20:01,745
What are you waiting for?

257
00:20:04,346 --> 00:20:05,746
Greetings, New Ulm.

258
00:20:05,946 --> 00:20:09,706
I'm here to usher in a new phase.

259
00:20:09,906 --> 00:20:11,427
This is a great opportunity.

260
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:15,547
I'm here to reconfigure
for the initialization of Rocket Bars.

261
00:20:23,468 --> 00:20:26,228
This will be an exciting utilization
of new branding...

262
00:20:26,428 --> 00:20:29,589
...for capitalizing
on a highly profitable demographic.

263
00:20:29,789 --> 00:20:30,789
Cut to the chase.

264
00:20:30,989 --> 00:20:34,309
We don't give a fart on a muggy day
what you're making us make.

265
00:20:34,509 --> 00:20:36,589
Tell us how many you're planning
on laying off.

266
00:20:36,789 --> 00:20:39,310
Management at Munck Foods
in Miami has sent me here...

267
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:41,990
...to conduct mechanization
and modernization procedures.

268
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:44,750
Yeah, you Munck-ees all say
that crap.

269
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:47,551
But every time one of you comes,
we end up losing jobs.

270
00:20:47,751 --> 00:20:49,711
Well, I'm interested
in the jobs we'll create.

271
00:20:49,911 --> 00:20:53,311
If you're not, that's fine, but I'll expect
you to implement the changes...

272
00:20:53,511 --> 00:20:55,192
...in a timely manner.

273
00:20:55,392 --> 00:20:56,632
Okay?

274
00:20:58,272 --> 00:21:00,032
Oh, yeah, well, nice try, Trudy.

275
00:21:00,232 --> 00:21:02,152
No, you're not getting
that recipe out of me.

276
00:21:02,352 --> 00:21:03,313
Because I...

277
00:21:03,513 --> 00:21:05,273
All right, listen, gotta go.
Okay, yeah.

278
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:06,553
Let me jump.

279
00:21:06,753 --> 00:21:08,713
Yeah, okay, I know.
I'll give it to you later.

280
00:21:08,913 --> 00:21:11,033
Okay, bye-bye then. Yeah, bye.

281
00:21:11,234 --> 00:21:12,714
Oh, good morning.
Sorry about that.

282
00:21:12,914 --> 00:21:16,594
That was Trudy. She's always trying
to get my tapioca recipe out of me.

283
00:21:16,754 --> 00:21:20,595
Yeah, well, I doubt that your tapioca
recipe is gonna affect the plant.

284
00:21:20,795 --> 00:21:22,555
So let's just stick to work
if we could.

285
00:21:22,755 --> 00:21:24,795
Oh, okay.
Oh, listen, sorry about being late.

286
00:21:24,995 --> 00:21:26,595
Billy had a run-in up at the school.

287
00:21:26,795 --> 00:21:29,076
Had to go talk to the principal,
don't you know?

288
00:21:29,276 --> 00:21:32,716
He thinks he's a little Puff Diddly,
in case you didn't notice last night.

289
00:21:34,476 --> 00:21:36,636
- Is that my office?
- Oh, yeah.

290
00:21:36,836 --> 00:21:38,557
I'd like to see you in there, please.

291
00:21:40,357 --> 00:21:43,477
As a female, do you know
how I'm on the fast track to VP...

292
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:45,758
...in a Fortune 500 company?
- No, I don't.

293
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:49,718
When it's time to work,
I concentrate on work.

294
00:21:50,198 --> 00:21:52,798
- I get you.
- And I expect one's personal life...

295
00:21:52,998 --> 00:21:54,279
...to be kept personal.

296
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,759
- Okay, that's easy.
- But not you, apparently.

297
00:21:56,959 --> 00:21:59,319
You're trying to set me up
after having just met me.

298
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:03,680
- Well, actually...
- I don't want excuses.

299
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,040
I am here to do a job.

300
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,880
I will not get personally attached
to this town or anybody.

301
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,280
- Okay, but listen...
- No buts.

302
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:13,721
But for the sake of argument,
let's say I did want to get set up.

303
00:22:13,921 --> 00:22:17,721
Trying to hook me up with that guy?
I may be in the middle of nowhere.

304
00:22:17,921 --> 00:22:21,482
But I am not so desperate that I would
consider your sorry-ass truck guy.

305
00:22:21,682 --> 00:22:23,162
- Right. Sorry-ass truck guy.
- Good.

306
00:22:23,362 --> 00:22:27,482
Now that that's clear,
let's just brush that off.

307
00:22:27,682 --> 00:22:32,163
So I can spend the rest of the morning
kissing the ass of the local union rep.

308
00:22:32,363 --> 00:22:34,683
Who I actually think is here.

309
00:22:44,244 --> 00:22:46,605
Why is he out there?

310
00:22:48,005 --> 00:22:49,725
Funny story.

311
00:22:51,205 --> 00:22:53,885
It might have been presumptuous
of me to try to set you up...

312
00:22:54,085 --> 00:22:56,166
...but I thought it might help
professionally...

313
00:22:56,366 --> 00:22:58,086
...if you were to meet
the union rep...

314
00:22:58,286 --> 00:23:00,606
...for all of southeastern Minnesota
casually...

315
00:23:00,766 --> 00:23:02,686
...over a nice home-cooked dinner.

316
00:23:03,287 --> 00:23:05,887
Ted is the local union rep?

317
00:23:06,687 --> 00:23:08,127
That's right.

318
00:23:08,327 --> 00:23:10,687
The guy that I yelled at
over your meatloaf?

319
00:23:10,887 --> 00:23:12,608
And in the driveway some too.

320
00:23:22,009 --> 00:23:23,369
Mr. Mitchell.

321
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:25,249
Ted, wasn't it?

322
00:23:25,449 --> 00:23:28,810
Yeah. But some people refer to me
as "sorry-ass truck guy."

323
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:31,010
I beg your pardon?

324
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:34,810
Union's been pushing
for better soundproofing in this plant.

325
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:38,011
But I think they should probably
extend it to the office walls too.

326
00:23:38,211 --> 00:23:39,171
Shall we?

327
00:23:41,931 --> 00:23:46,092
Well, going over union regulations
for two hours is not helping.

328
00:23:46,292 --> 00:23:49,892
What I'm trying to do is make sure that
during this simple reconfiguration...

329
00:23:50,052 --> 00:23:53,052
...as you call it,
that not one union job gets cut.

330
00:23:53,252 --> 00:23:54,853
I'm sure we can come
to an agreement.

331
00:23:55,053 --> 00:23:58,413
I'm gonna make sure that you comply
with that agreement every step.

332
00:23:58,613 --> 00:23:59,573
Goodbye.

333
00:23:59,773 --> 00:24:01,173
How is the first day going?

334
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:02,813
It's been a very productive day.

335
00:24:03,013 --> 00:24:05,254
I've spoken to the employees
and the plant foreman.

336
00:24:05,414 --> 00:24:07,974
And they are very engaged
in the process.

337
00:24:08,174 --> 00:24:10,334
I've laid out my work strategy
with my assistant.

338
00:24:10,534 --> 00:24:13,215
And I've begun dialoguing
with the local union rep.

339
00:24:13,415 --> 00:24:16,375
I'm sure I'll be able to forge
a working relationship there.

340
00:24:16,575 --> 00:24:18,975
All right, but if we're gonna downsize
by 50 percent...

341
00:24:19,175 --> 00:24:21,536
...I need you to prioritize
your termination list.

342
00:24:21,736 --> 00:24:24,296
Hi there. I wanted to let you know
I've rearranged my desk.

343
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:26,736
It looks so nice
and professional now.

344
00:24:26,936 --> 00:24:29,897
So if you need anything, a drink,
or a snack, or you get homesick...

345
00:24:30,097 --> 00:24:31,977
...you wanna talk,
you just give me a shout.

346
00:24:35,177 --> 00:24:37,778
I'm so sorry.

347
00:24:41,498 --> 00:24:44,458
Oh, I'm already on that.

348
00:25:03,821 --> 00:25:06,461
All I'm asking
is that we move these machines...

349
00:25:06,661 --> 00:25:09,141
...to make room
for the new production equipment.

350
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:10,301
Yeah, no.

351
00:25:10,501 --> 00:25:13,462
- That's not the way we do things.
- Nope, not the way we do things.

352
00:25:13,662 --> 00:25:14,942
Not the way at all.

353
00:25:15,142 --> 00:25:17,462
You're going to have to make
some concessions.

354
00:25:17,662 --> 00:25:19,822
Oh, we're making
some damn concessions.

355
00:25:20,022 --> 00:25:21,583
Like Gopher Day.

356
00:25:21,783 --> 00:25:23,343
- Gopher Day?
- Yeah.

357
00:25:23,543 --> 00:25:25,983
Local holiday.
First Friday of November.

358
00:25:26,183 --> 00:25:29,104
We've always gotten it off before,
but we're all working this one.

359
00:25:29,304 --> 00:25:30,264
Okay.

360
00:25:30,464 --> 00:25:32,424
If I close the plant
for Gopher Day at noon...

361
00:25:32,624 --> 00:25:35,144
...then come Monday,
you'll start shifting equipment?

362
00:25:35,344 --> 00:25:37,104
- Sure. You betcha.
- Yeah, okay.

363
00:25:37,264 --> 00:25:38,385
Great.

364
00:25:53,266 --> 00:25:54,466
Happy Gopher Day.

365
00:26:19,309 --> 00:26:20,429
Is there a problem here?

366
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:23,110
You're damn right
there's a problem.

367
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:25,470
You know, Land O' Lakes
was doing just fine...

368
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:28,190
...before you greedy Munck-ees
captured it...

369
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:31,111
...and started killing off
my loyal hardworking customers.

370
00:26:33,951 --> 00:26:35,591
Listen, Flo.

371
00:26:35,791 --> 00:26:37,391
I'm here to do a job.

372
00:26:37,591 --> 00:26:42,592
Just like I'd like you to do your job now
by taking my order, okay?

373
00:26:44,632 --> 00:26:45,592
Great.

374
00:26:45,792 --> 00:26:50,113
Now that that's clear,
what's the special today?

375
00:26:51,593 --> 00:26:55,194
We got a Go-Back-to-Miami
Where-You-Belong special.

376
00:26:57,314 --> 00:26:59,554
Oh, and Happy Gopher Day.

377
00:27:02,474 --> 00:27:06,395
How lame-ass do you have to be
to fall for something as butt-stupid...

378
00:27:06,595 --> 00:27:09,315
...as thinking there's a Gopher Day?

379
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:45,279
Oh, shingles.

380
00:27:45,479 --> 00:27:47,680
Who invited the boss lady?

381
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,520
What do you want?

382
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,960
I thought I might buy you a beer.

383
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:57,521
It's a free country.

384
00:27:57,721 --> 00:28:00,201
A proactive approach
to streamline production...

385
00:28:00,401 --> 00:28:02,241
...creates a win-win situation.

386
00:28:03,201 --> 00:28:06,882
Of course, it requires strategization
and advanced specialization.

387
00:28:07,082 --> 00:28:08,202
Yeah.

388
00:28:10,162 --> 00:28:11,642
This is really great, guys.

389
00:28:11,842 --> 00:28:13,763
I'm glad we're finally dialoguing.

390
00:28:13,963 --> 00:28:15,003
D-word, double shot.

391
00:28:19,483 --> 00:28:22,724
Are you guys really interested
in discussing mechanization?

392
00:28:22,884 --> 00:28:23,924
Hell, yeah.

393
00:28:28,924 --> 00:28:29,885
I'm really sorry, guys.

394
00:28:30,085 --> 00:28:33,045
I meant for that to be a D-word,
so you can all do a double shot.

395
00:28:33,245 --> 00:28:34,845
Way to ruin it, Maurice.

396
00:28:36,245 --> 00:28:41,086
You know, I'm in charge of this plant
whether you like it or not.

397
00:28:41,406 --> 00:28:44,366
I thought this would be an opportunity
for us to bury the hatchet...

398
00:28:44,566 --> 00:28:48,367
...but, instead, you just turn me
into some dumb drinking game?

399
00:28:48,567 --> 00:28:51,087
Thanks a lot, asshole.

400
00:29:02,208 --> 00:29:03,408
Oh, hi there.

401
00:29:03,608 --> 00:29:06,249
It's official.
The lakes froze enough to drive on.

402
00:29:06,449 --> 00:29:09,089
So Stu declared it a holiday.

403
00:29:11,369 --> 00:29:12,329
He did, did he?

404
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:15,850
And where can I find Stu?

405
00:30:02,015 --> 00:30:03,735
Now, who invited boss lady
this time?

406
00:30:03,935 --> 00:30:06,496
You miserable son of a bitch.

407
00:30:06,696 --> 00:30:08,976
Ice Day?
What, Gopher Day wasn't enough?

408
00:30:09,136 --> 00:30:13,097
Well, you've underestimated who
you're messing with, Stu Kopenhafer.

409
00:30:13,297 --> 00:30:14,977
You're fired.

410
00:30:19,377 --> 00:30:20,657
Crap.

411
00:30:24,498 --> 00:30:26,058
You can't fire Stu.

412
00:30:26,258 --> 00:30:28,218
I can, and I did.

413
00:30:28,418 --> 00:30:29,378
Ice Day?

414
00:30:29,578 --> 00:30:31,459
Just how stupid
does everyone think I am?

415
00:30:31,659 --> 00:30:33,459
What? On a scale of one to 10?

416
00:30:33,619 --> 00:30:36,459
The first day of ice fishing
is a state holiday.

417
00:30:36,859 --> 00:30:37,819
Fine.

418
00:30:38,019 --> 00:30:39,580
I fired him for insubordination.

419
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:41,380
Hang on a second.

420
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:43,380
Stu...

421
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:46,740
He takes a little while to warm up
to folks, but he's a really good man.

422
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:48,461
Good?

423
00:30:49,341 --> 00:30:51,461
Clearly, we define that differently.

424
00:30:51,661 --> 00:30:54,541
But I'm just trying to help you
out here, okay?

425
00:30:54,741 --> 00:30:56,502
Firing the foreman
before Thanksgiving...

426
00:30:56,702 --> 00:30:58,302
...that's not gonna win you friends.

427
00:30:58,502 --> 00:31:00,822
Well, I'm here to do a job,
not make friends.

428
00:31:01,022 --> 00:31:02,742
Stu's fired.

429
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:04,503
Good night.

430
00:31:13,424 --> 00:31:16,584
You expect me to believe
that every machine in the line...

431
00:31:16,784 --> 00:31:19,664
...just broke down at the same time?

432
00:31:34,186 --> 00:31:36,506
<i>And Thanksgiving
is gonna be a white one.</i>

433
00:31:36,666 --> 00:31:38,226
<i>We're expecting
another snowstorm...</i>

434
00:31:38,426 --> 00:31:40,267
<i>...blowing in
sometime tomorrow afternoon.</i>

435
00:31:40,467 --> 00:31:44,827
It doesn't matter. I'm going to Miami.

436
00:32:22,352 --> 00:32:24,352
That's right.

437
00:32:54,075 --> 00:32:55,675
Come on.

438
00:32:56,356 --> 00:32:58,316
Oh, come on.

439
00:33:01,796 --> 00:33:03,916
Oh, this is not good.

440
00:34:02,603 --> 00:34:04,243
Hey.

441
00:34:14,925 --> 00:34:17,805
I'm in... I'm in here.

442
00:34:20,005 --> 00:34:21,645
Help.

443
00:34:22,406 --> 00:34:24,006
Help.

444
00:34:25,526 --> 00:34:27,726
Help. I'm in here.

445
00:34:44,928 --> 00:34:46,688
Thanks a lot, God.

446
00:34:46,888 --> 00:34:48,009
Come on.

447
00:34:48,209 --> 00:34:49,689
- Okay.
- I got you.

448
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:51,769
Okay. Hey...

449
00:34:51,969 --> 00:34:55,409
Watch the hands,
Mr. Touchy-Feely Hands.

450
00:34:55,609 --> 00:34:57,130
Don't flatter yourself.

451
00:34:57,330 --> 00:34:59,330
I'm trying to get you out of the car.
Come on.

452
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:03,330
For your information,
I do not need a man to rescue me.

453
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:05,451
- All right.
- Okay.

454
00:35:18,132 --> 00:35:19,452
Come on.

455
00:35:22,173 --> 00:35:23,813
Let's get you home.

456
00:35:44,735 --> 00:35:49,536
You know, you're not so bad
when you're unconscious.

457
00:36:14,259 --> 00:36:16,699
- Come on.
- Oh, yup.

458
00:36:18,979 --> 00:36:20,819
I got it, I got it.

459
00:36:21,019 --> 00:36:22,980
- I got it.
- You okay?

460
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:29,980
I got it. I got it.

461
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:33,341
I don't need to be carried
through my door...

462
00:36:33,501 --> 00:36:36,981
...by some sexy fireman man.

463
00:36:37,181 --> 00:36:39,101
You already gave me
that lecture.

464
00:36:39,261 --> 00:36:40,382
You think I'm sexy, huh?

465
00:36:40,582 --> 00:36:42,382
What? Why would you think that?

466
00:36:42,582 --> 00:36:44,262
Because you just said it.

467
00:36:44,462 --> 00:36:46,222
Out loud?

468
00:36:50,623 --> 00:36:51,543
Here, let me help you.

469
00:36:51,743 --> 00:36:52,703
- I got it.
- Hold on.

470
00:36:52,903 --> 00:36:55,183
- I got it.
- Let me help you, let me help you.

471
00:36:57,904 --> 00:37:00,104
Don't get any ideas.

472
00:37:00,304 --> 00:37:01,544
I'm not.

473
00:37:01,744 --> 00:37:02,904
You okay?

474
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:04,904
I'm fine.

475
00:37:05,945 --> 00:37:07,465
Fine.

476
00:37:15,106 --> 00:37:17,546
- You okay?
- Yeah.

477
00:37:17,746 --> 00:37:19,426
I'm fine.

478
00:38:22,594 --> 00:38:26,074
This will be a good chance for you
to get out and about a little more.

479
00:38:26,754 --> 00:38:28,194
Hi, girls.

480
00:38:29,034 --> 00:38:30,594
We've sold all your tapioca.

481
00:38:30,794 --> 00:38:32,235
Oh, good.

482
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:38,075
How about that rescue?

483
00:38:38,275 --> 00:38:40,036
No wonder
she's looking twitterpated.

484
00:38:40,236 --> 00:38:42,356
Oh, getting saved
by a cutie patootie like that...

485
00:38:42,556 --> 00:38:45,396
...no one could blame you
for getting a little crush, you know?

486
00:38:45,596 --> 00:38:46,756
Crush?

487
00:38:46,956 --> 00:38:48,036
Ted?

488
00:38:48,236 --> 00:38:49,157
I don't think so.

489
00:38:49,357 --> 00:38:52,157
Speaking of your rescue,
we made this.

490
00:38:52,357 --> 00:38:53,717
You keep that in your trunk.

491
00:38:53,917 --> 00:38:55,677
It's got our names and numbers
sewn in...

492
00:38:55,877 --> 00:38:57,798
...so next time
you have emergency contacts.

493
00:38:57,998 --> 00:39:01,478
Oh, that's... That's beautiful.

494
00:39:01,678 --> 00:39:03,758
- You didn't have to do that.
- Oh, we know.

495
00:39:03,958 --> 00:39:06,639
But we did it anyways,
and that's what matters the most.

496
00:39:06,839 --> 00:39:08,719
Just the thought of you
out in that storm.

497
00:39:08,879 --> 00:39:10,879
You must have been scared
out of your mind.

498
00:39:11,079 --> 00:39:13,199
Oh, I'm sure I was never
in any real danger.

499
00:39:13,399 --> 00:39:14,800
You kidding?

500
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,680
Folks around these parts
freeze to death all the time.

501
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,360
Especially the stupid ones.

502
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:22,720
It's nature's way
of thinning out the herd, if you ask me.

503
00:39:23,601 --> 00:39:25,961
And that Ted,
he's a handsome devil.

504
00:39:26,161 --> 00:39:29,041
Now he's bending over
to lift that hose.

505
00:39:29,201 --> 00:39:30,881
Oh, will you just lookie there?

506
00:39:36,122 --> 00:39:39,722
You guys cannot handle that.

507
00:39:40,563 --> 00:39:41,803
I don't know about that.

508
00:39:42,003 --> 00:39:43,763
- Hey.
- Hi.

509
00:39:44,083 --> 00:39:46,243
Hey, so the other night.

510
00:39:46,443 --> 00:39:48,323
I was a little drunk.

511
00:39:48,524 --> 00:39:50,204
I might have said some things.

512
00:39:50,404 --> 00:39:51,924
Hey, you were great out there, huh?

513
00:39:52,124 --> 00:39:53,324
Here, kid, come here.

514
00:39:54,324 --> 00:39:55,764
I am so proud of you.

515
00:39:56,604 --> 00:39:59,445
You remember Lucy Hill?
This is Bobbie.

516
00:39:59,885 --> 00:40:01,165
Hi.

517
00:40:01,365 --> 00:40:02,525
What's up?

518
00:40:03,165 --> 00:40:06,006
Crosscheck by the goalie. Nice.

519
00:40:15,607 --> 00:40:17,087
It's great.

520
00:40:22,407 --> 00:40:24,048
Blanche.

521
00:40:25,448 --> 00:40:27,688
Thank you for cashing in my ticket.

522
00:40:27,888 --> 00:40:29,528
Oh, no trouble at all. Oh, and listen.

523
00:40:29,728 --> 00:40:31,448
Your car's all fixed up good as new.

524
00:40:32,409 --> 00:40:33,689
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

525
00:40:33,849 --> 00:40:35,729
A little something for you.

526
00:40:36,449 --> 00:40:37,849
Oh, it's money.

527
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:42,690
It's a holiday bonus.

528
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:44,010
Don't you usually get one?

529
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:47,290
Normally, we exchange gifts.

530
00:40:47,450 --> 00:40:48,731
But this is nice too.

531
00:40:49,691 --> 00:40:51,451
Oh, and listen.

532
00:40:52,131 --> 00:40:53,891
Here's a little Merry Christmas
for you.

533
00:40:54,691 --> 00:40:56,771
Oh, Blanche, you didn't have
to get me anything.

534
00:40:56,971 --> 00:41:00,172
Oh, I didn't get it,
not like store-bought get it.

535
00:41:00,372 --> 00:41:01,972
I made it.

536
00:41:02,172 --> 00:41:03,172
Here, open it.

537
00:41:07,933 --> 00:41:10,213
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

538
00:41:14,734 --> 00:41:17,774
Just in case
you wanted to start scrapping.

539
00:41:26,295 --> 00:41:28,695
"To Lucy. From Blanche."

540
00:41:34,176 --> 00:41:36,656
That was your first day here,
remember?

541
00:41:44,417 --> 00:41:45,977
When did you take that?

542
00:41:46,177 --> 00:41:48,257
Oh, that was a while ago.

543
00:41:48,457 --> 00:41:51,418
You looked like you had the weight
of the world on your shoulders.

544
00:41:51,618 --> 00:41:53,378
So alone.

545
00:41:54,658 --> 00:41:57,218
But, you know, Lucy,
you're never really alone.

546
00:41:57,418 --> 00:42:00,059
Jesus understands
what you're going through.

547
00:42:00,259 --> 00:42:02,219
He's there for you.

548
00:42:03,219 --> 00:42:04,979
So am I.

549
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:14,300
Hey, don't go getting all misty
on me.

550
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:15,701
Here. I got something else.

551
00:42:15,901 --> 00:42:18,301
This ought to cheer you right up.

552
00:42:19,821 --> 00:42:21,221
Some tapioca.

553
00:42:22,501 --> 00:42:24,422
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas, Blanche.

554
00:42:24,582 --> 00:42:26,262
Can I have a hug?

555
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:36,863
Coming.

556
00:43:24,269 --> 00:43:25,909
Thanks.

557
00:44:12,754 --> 00:44:14,674
Ted is here for your meeting.

558
00:44:17,635 --> 00:44:19,795
- Hi.
- Hi.

559
00:44:21,195 --> 00:44:22,275
Thanks.

560
00:44:24,636 --> 00:44:27,596
Well, isn't this a nice way
to start out the New Year?

561
00:44:27,796 --> 00:44:30,396
"Auld Lang Syne,"
resolutions and all that.

562
00:44:32,156 --> 00:44:35,397
If I can get you two anything,
you two just say the word.

563
00:44:41,678 --> 00:44:44,118
I got the comp analysis here.

564
00:44:44,318 --> 00:44:45,998
Okay.

565
00:44:49,799 --> 00:44:51,959
Before we get started.

566
00:44:52,279 --> 00:44:54,079
I never had the chance
to clear the air...

567
00:44:54,279 --> 00:44:57,879
...after you saved me
from the snow bank.

568
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:03,480
I said a lot of rude things,
and I handled it badly.

569
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:07,921
I think you handled it fine.
You didn't try to get out of your car.

570
00:45:08,121 --> 00:45:10,001
And that's good,
because a lot of people...

571
00:45:10,201 --> 00:45:13,521
...they try to walk for help,
and they end up dying that way.

572
00:45:13,721 --> 00:45:15,642
You were just trying to keep warm.

573
00:45:15,842 --> 00:45:19,242
Although, technically,
alcohol isn't recommended.

574
00:45:19,442 --> 00:45:22,802
And the red flag, that was...

575
00:45:23,122 --> 00:45:25,003
That was brilliant.

576
00:45:27,483 --> 00:45:29,723
Now, I don't remember
anything rude.

577
00:45:31,643 --> 00:45:33,644
Well, I don't remember
saying thank you.

578
00:45:33,844 --> 00:45:35,924
And that's hardly sufficient.

579
00:45:36,124 --> 00:45:37,084
So thank you.

580
00:45:38,364 --> 00:45:40,084
You're welcome.

581
00:45:41,445 --> 00:45:42,525
So comp analysis.

582
00:45:42,725 --> 00:45:44,965
Yes, comp analysis.

583
00:45:45,165 --> 00:45:47,965
Okay, should we start
with the executive group?

584
00:45:59,727 --> 00:46:01,887
- Lucy.
- Returning your bowl.

585
00:46:02,087 --> 00:46:03,847
Oh, what a nice surprise.
Come on in.

586
00:46:04,047 --> 00:46:06,007
Lucy's here.

587
00:46:07,048 --> 00:46:09,488
Just so you know,
I transferred it to another container.

588
00:46:09,688 --> 00:46:11,368
It's not like I ate it in one sitting.

589
00:46:11,568 --> 00:46:13,488
- We never do.
- Oh, stop.

590
00:46:13,688 --> 00:46:15,889
Sit down. Listen, it's not fattening.

591
00:46:16,089 --> 00:46:18,529
Ever since Harve's
been on his crazy Atkins kick...

592
00:46:18,729 --> 00:46:21,169
...I had to come up
with a couple of new recipes.

593
00:46:21,369 --> 00:46:23,289
Don't even look at me,
Trudy Van Uuden.

594
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:25,490
You're not getting my secret
out of me.

595
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:30,210
But I will tell you, my tapioca's
mainly low-fat milk and whey protein.

596
00:46:30,410 --> 00:46:32,290
- No way.
- Yes, whey.

597
00:46:32,491 --> 00:46:34,851
Just in time.
We're exchanging Valentine's cards.

598
00:46:35,051 --> 00:46:36,571
We've got yours.

599
00:46:36,771 --> 00:46:40,211
Oh, you know, I was just gonna forget
that whole thing this year.

600
00:46:40,411 --> 00:46:42,812
You know,
greeting-card-company holiday.

601
00:46:43,012 --> 00:46:44,572
Here's for you.

602
00:46:45,892 --> 00:46:48,972
Harve? Would you get that?

603
00:46:49,492 --> 00:46:51,493
Maybe that's cupid
looking for you right now.

604
00:46:52,973 --> 00:46:54,013
It's just Ted.

605
00:46:57,733 --> 00:46:59,694
I got... I got a big problem.

606
00:46:59,894 --> 00:47:02,614
I need... I need a woman's help
on this one.

607
00:47:03,974 --> 00:47:05,974
It's out... Just out here.

608
00:47:06,174 --> 00:47:08,215
Female trouble?

609
00:47:08,415 --> 00:47:09,375
Sort of.

610
00:47:09,575 --> 00:47:12,735
It's the Valentine's Dance,
you know?

611
00:47:12,935 --> 00:47:15,696
L... I just didn't think
it was gonna be that big of a deal.

612
00:47:15,896 --> 00:47:18,576
Oh, honey, it's her first date.
Big deal doesn't even start.

613
00:47:18,776 --> 00:47:21,176
It's not like I didn't try.

614
00:47:24,217 --> 00:47:26,137
- I bought her a nice dress.
- Nice?

615
00:47:26,337 --> 00:47:31,377
- Pilgrims wore sexier outfits.
- She's 13, okay?

616
00:47:31,577 --> 00:47:35,378
- Sexy isn't on the menu.
- Okay, is this about the dress?

617
00:47:37,658 --> 00:47:38,858
No, it's a little bit worse.

618
00:47:39,418 --> 00:47:40,658
Worse than that outfit?

619
00:47:41,419 --> 00:47:42,979
Bobbie, did you want to come out?

620
00:47:43,179 --> 00:47:45,339
No, I can't be seen in public.

621
00:47:45,539 --> 00:47:48,579
- Ever.
- It's probably not as bad as you think.

622
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:57,740
I took her to the beauty parlor.
They gave her a perm.

623
00:47:59,021 --> 00:48:00,021
Maybe a couple of bows?

624
00:48:00,661 --> 00:48:01,781
Scarves are in these days.

625
00:48:01,981 --> 00:48:03,941
- Oh, yeah, good idea, Trudy.
- Ted, I can help.

626
00:48:04,141 --> 00:48:06,421
But Bobbie will have to come with me.
Is that okay?

627
00:48:07,021 --> 00:48:09,542
- Yeah.
- Bobbie, trust me.

628
00:48:09,742 --> 00:48:11,742
Get in the car.

629
00:48:11,942 --> 00:48:14,542
And put your little hat back on.

630
00:48:32,784 --> 00:48:36,105
Ladies, can we talk shoes?

631
00:48:39,585 --> 00:48:40,665
They're heels.

632
00:48:40,865 --> 00:48:43,666
Little ones. That's okay, right?

633
00:48:43,866 --> 00:48:46,386
My first heels.

634
00:48:46,866 --> 00:48:49,266
But they ain't
gonna wear themselves.

635
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:54,507
They're perfect.

636
00:48:55,667 --> 00:48:57,987
She like Cinderella and shit.

637
00:49:03,268 --> 00:49:06,188
May I present
Miss Roberta Mitchell.

638
00:49:15,509 --> 00:49:19,070
Bobbie, you... You look just like...

639
00:49:21,710 --> 00:49:23,270
You're so beautiful.

640
00:49:31,151 --> 00:49:33,952
Good evening, Mr. Mitchell.

641
00:49:34,872 --> 00:49:35,952
Hi, Waylon.

642
00:49:36,152 --> 00:49:38,432
Wow, Bobs, you look hot.

643
00:49:38,632 --> 00:49:40,312
- The hell she does.
- Here.

644
00:49:40,512 --> 00:49:42,833
That's my little girl.
There's nothing hot about her.

645
00:49:43,033 --> 00:49:44,713
Gee, thanks, Dad.

646
00:49:46,793 --> 00:49:49,713
You know, I was 14 once too.

647
00:49:49,913 --> 00:49:53,994
So I know all about what's going
through your head right now.

648
00:49:55,714 --> 00:49:56,714
And your pants.

649
00:49:56,914 --> 00:49:58,394
Daddy.

650
00:49:58,594 --> 00:50:00,155
Come on, your mom's waiting.

651
00:50:00,355 --> 00:50:02,355
- Okay.
- Hey, hey, hey.

652
00:50:03,075 --> 00:50:04,955
You're gonna have her home
by 10:30, right?

653
00:50:05,115 --> 00:50:07,115
- Yeah.
- Okay, hey, hey, listen.

654
00:50:07,315 --> 00:50:09,756
I want you to remember something.

655
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:15,436
Whatever you do to my daughter,
I do to you.

656
00:50:19,997 --> 00:50:22,917
I think what your father meant to say
is go and have a good time.

657
00:50:23,117 --> 00:50:25,718
That's not what I meant, actually.

658
00:50:25,918 --> 00:50:27,198
That's not what I said.

659
00:50:29,278 --> 00:50:31,118
That is so not what I meant at all.

660
00:50:32,158 --> 00:50:33,559
Are you okay?

661
00:50:33,759 --> 00:50:36,799
Oh, I'm fine.

662
00:50:36,999 --> 00:50:39,399
I'm fine. I'm just...

663
00:50:40,759 --> 00:50:42,200
I'm old.

664
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:45,600
My daughter is starting to date,
you know? How did that happen?

665
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:46,960
I don't feel so good.

666
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:50,080
I'm gonna just sit down for a minute.
I can't feel my feet.

667
00:50:50,961 --> 00:50:52,441
Yeah.

668
00:50:53,961 --> 00:50:55,361
I think I'm having a stroke.

669
00:50:56,681 --> 00:51:00,002
You know what?
I might be having a heart attack too.

670
00:51:00,202 --> 00:51:01,962
Because my hands, they're numb.

671
00:51:02,162 --> 00:51:05,202
Is it your left hand or your right hand
with a heart attack?

672
00:51:05,402 --> 00:51:07,522
I can't remember which hand it is.

673
00:51:11,243 --> 00:51:13,723
So how did you know
I wasn't having a heart attack?

674
00:51:13,923 --> 00:51:18,204
Because I've seen this thing before.
My father was very overprotective.

675
00:51:18,404 --> 00:51:21,724
So I guess this isn't how you planned
on spending your Saturday.

676
00:51:21,924 --> 00:51:26,645
You know, nothing about Minnesota
has fallen into what I planned.

677
00:51:26,845 --> 00:51:28,405
I hear you.

678
00:51:31,245 --> 00:51:34,566
You know,
I used to go to the factory a lot.

679
00:51:34,726 --> 00:51:37,846
Outside of Miami, with my dad.

680
00:51:38,046 --> 00:51:40,566
He knew everything about it,
inside and out.

681
00:51:40,766 --> 00:51:42,607
Even the guys in the suits
would ask him...

682
00:51:42,807 --> 00:51:44,327
...how to get things done,
you know?

683
00:51:46,087 --> 00:51:48,247
I thought he was the boss.

684
00:51:49,927 --> 00:51:51,888
I was really surprised.

685
00:51:55,888 --> 00:51:58,408
He did maintenance at the plant.

686
00:51:58,608 --> 00:52:02,329
You know, he really drilled that
into my head. That...

687
00:52:02,529 --> 00:52:03,809
You know, get an education...

688
00:52:04,009 --> 00:52:07,009
...and it's the only thing
that people can't take away from you.

689
00:52:07,209 --> 00:52:09,210
Work hard
and do what needs to be done...

690
00:52:09,410 --> 00:52:15,250
...and maybe one day
you'll be the boss of a place like this.

691
00:52:17,091 --> 00:52:18,091
Ironic, isn't it?

692
00:52:21,011 --> 00:52:22,731
And how about you?

693
00:52:23,611 --> 00:52:26,292
How did you end up in New Ulm?

694
00:52:28,532 --> 00:52:29,932
The Mayo Clinic.

695
00:52:33,973 --> 00:52:38,293
- The Mayo Clinic?
- It's just a few miles from here.

696
00:52:39,333 --> 00:52:44,134
I was born in North Carolina,
and I went to school in Auburn.

697
00:52:44,334 --> 00:52:46,694
I met my wife, Brenda, there.

698
00:52:48,774 --> 00:52:51,055
It's funny, I say my wife.

699
00:52:51,215 --> 00:52:54,335
And even though it's been,
what, six years...

700
00:52:54,535 --> 00:52:57,135
...I still feel like she just ran out...

701
00:52:57,335 --> 00:52:59,696
...to the store to get something,
you know?

702
00:53:06,256 --> 00:53:11,417
She was diagnosed
with a degenerative heart defect.

703
00:53:12,497 --> 00:53:17,818
And they had this program at the clinic
and that became our life really.

704
00:53:18,258 --> 00:53:20,058
Trips to the clinic.

705
00:53:21,458 --> 00:53:24,658
When the phone rang,
I'd just hold my breath.

706
00:53:31,699 --> 00:53:33,820
Did you ever think about
moving back South?

707
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:38,820
This was really the only home
that Bobbie ever knew...

708
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:41,420
...and she'd just lost her mama.

709
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:43,621
And it didn't seem fair for her...

710
00:53:43,821 --> 00:53:46,701
...to lose her home and her friends
and her school and all that.

711
00:53:46,901 --> 00:53:48,221
So...

712
00:54:28,986 --> 00:54:31,306
- What time is it?
- I don't know.

713
00:54:51,669 --> 00:54:55,029
Well, you're finally home. Because
all I've done is sit here and worry.

714
00:54:55,229 --> 00:54:57,069
It's not even 10:30.

715
00:54:57,269 --> 00:54:58,669
Lucy, you're still here?

716
00:54:59,990 --> 00:55:03,830
Well, I had to make sure he didn't get
the shotgun out if you were late.

717
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:10,031
And now that I've seen to that...

718
00:55:10,231 --> 00:55:12,871
Did you have a good time?
Was it fun?

719
00:55:14,951 --> 00:55:16,191
It was all right.

720
00:55:16,711 --> 00:55:20,632
You know, I'm really sorry
about getting all weird on you earlier.

721
00:55:20,832 --> 00:55:23,312
It's okay.
I guess Ginny Linstrom's dad...

722
00:55:23,512 --> 00:55:25,633
...gave the same creepy lecture
to Cliffie Morgan.

723
00:55:30,353 --> 00:55:33,113
Thank you for everything.

724
00:55:37,474 --> 00:55:39,074
- Good night.
- Good night.

725
00:55:39,274 --> 00:55:40,754
Good night.

726
00:56:10,358 --> 00:56:11,318
We're not as far...

727
00:56:11,518 --> 00:56:13,838
...on the automation and downsizing
as we had hoped.

728
00:56:14,038 --> 00:56:18,279
That's because the robotic arms
are still in some warehouse in Japan.

729
00:56:18,759 --> 00:56:21,519
If we start to downsize, we're not
gonna have the workforce...

730
00:56:21,719 --> 00:56:23,799
<i>...for installation.
- This is costing us money.</i>

731
00:56:23,999 --> 00:56:25,479
I understand.

732
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:27,440
I will keep you apprised.

733
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:30,520
<i>- We'll talk next week then.
- All right.</i>

734
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:32,640
Goodbye.

735
00:56:35,801 --> 00:56:38,041
<i>- Lucy Hill.
- Hey, Lucy, it's Ted.</i>

736
00:56:38,241 --> 00:56:40,081
Listen, I have this idea for Saturday.

737
00:56:40,281 --> 00:56:44,482
I was thinking I could
pick you up around 8 in the morning.

738
00:56:45,322 --> 00:56:47,602
Yeah, wear something
you can get dirty, okay?

739
00:56:47,802 --> 00:56:49,802
Something dirty?

740
00:56:54,123 --> 00:56:55,683
- Hey.
- Hi.

741
00:56:56,243 --> 00:56:58,723
You...
You might wanna put these on.

742
00:56:59,483 --> 00:57:01,044
What is it?

743
00:57:01,804 --> 00:57:03,724
Crow hunting.

744
00:57:05,124 --> 00:57:08,965
- But I don't wanna shoot a crow.
- You don't have to shoot a crow.

745
00:57:09,165 --> 00:57:10,325
You can just shoot at them.

746
00:57:10,525 --> 00:57:15,365
It's a chance for you to get out,
you know, befriend the locals.

747
00:57:25,326 --> 00:57:29,567
Stu. What's the chance of me
running into you out here?

748
00:57:29,767 --> 00:57:31,287
Holy balls, why did you bring her?

749
00:57:31,487 --> 00:57:33,807
She said she wanted to get out,
do a little shooting.

750
00:57:33,967 --> 00:57:35,208
Shooting?

751
00:57:35,888 --> 00:57:37,568
You even got shells there, girlie?

752
00:57:37,768 --> 00:57:40,408
Yeah. Yeah, I've got shells.

753
00:57:40,608 --> 00:57:43,809
Oh, it's a great day.

754
00:57:47,569 --> 00:57:49,369
Almost.

755
00:57:53,010 --> 00:57:56,690
Okay, that's it. I gotta...

756
00:57:57,050 --> 00:57:58,650
- What?
- I need to...

757
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:03,651
- What are you talking about?
- I need to pee.

758
00:58:08,571 --> 00:58:09,772
You're kidding me, right?

759
00:58:09,972 --> 00:58:12,732
Oh, for crying
in the beer-cheese soup.

760
00:58:12,932 --> 00:58:15,372
Are you such a city girl
you can't pee outside?

761
00:58:15,572 --> 00:58:19,853
You see, Stu, that's just one
of the advantages of being a city girl.

762
00:58:20,053 --> 00:58:20,973
You don't have to.

763
00:58:22,013 --> 00:58:24,733
Don't let the badgers
bite you in the ass.

764
00:58:25,293 --> 00:58:27,094
Badgers? Really?

765
00:58:27,294 --> 00:58:29,454
Is he serious?

766
00:58:33,814 --> 00:58:35,975
Just in case.

767
00:59:09,459 --> 00:59:10,979
Oh, come on.

768
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:23,340
Ted!

769
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:29,221
Okay, where is it?
Where is it, where is it, where is it?

770
00:59:29,421 --> 00:59:31,781
Where, where, where? Okay.

771
00:59:38,822 --> 00:59:39,942
What?

772
00:59:41,662 --> 00:59:43,783
You can really show a girl
a good time, you know?

773
00:59:43,983 --> 00:59:46,303
I'm trying to give you a chance
to patch things up...

774
00:59:46,503 --> 00:59:48,103
...if you would be a sport about it.

775
00:59:48,303 --> 00:59:49,743
I'm being a sport.

776
00:59:49,943 --> 00:59:51,743
But just... I'm stuck.

777
00:59:51,944 --> 00:59:54,104
Then talk to him about fishing.
He loves fishing...

778
00:59:54,304 --> 00:59:56,464
No, no, no,
I'm not stuck for conversation.

779
00:59:56,664 --> 01:00:00,705
- I'm stuck in your stupid overalls.
- All right, hold on.

780
01:00:07,825 --> 01:00:09,186
Turn around.

781
01:00:11,066 --> 01:00:12,626
Don't move.

782
01:00:15,226 --> 01:00:17,026
Stop moving.

783
01:00:19,067 --> 01:00:20,827
Okay, hold on, hold on.

784
01:00:21,507 --> 01:00:23,947
Hold on a second.
Hold on, hold on.

785
01:00:24,147 --> 01:00:25,547
I got it.

786
01:00:26,147 --> 01:00:28,028
Oh, that's not good.

787
01:00:34,949 --> 01:00:36,109
- Turn around.
- Okay.

788
01:00:36,309 --> 01:00:37,509
- No, wait...
- For real.

789
01:00:37,709 --> 01:00:39,869
- What are you gonna do?
- Bend over.

790
01:00:40,069 --> 01:00:41,549
- What are you gonna do?
- Bend over.

791
01:00:41,749 --> 01:00:42,869
Oh, okay, okay.

792
01:00:43,069 --> 01:00:46,350
- Bend over.
- Hurry, just hurry.

793
01:00:47,270 --> 01:00:48,630
Cool.

794
01:00:48,830 --> 01:00:51,470
You could have just cut the zipper.

795
01:00:53,471 --> 01:00:56,591
- Are you wearing a thong?
- You said something dirty.

796
01:00:56,791 --> 01:00:59,551
I said what? I said wear something
you can get dirty.

797
01:00:59,751 --> 01:01:01,112
Just go.

798
01:01:01,312 --> 01:01:04,592
And don't watch. Go. Go.

799
01:01:04,792 --> 01:01:06,432
Go!

800
01:01:22,194 --> 01:01:24,674
- I'll be damned.
- I'm not really certain about that.

801
01:01:24,874 --> 01:01:26,395
I did hear they knew each other...

802
01:01:26,595 --> 01:01:27,915
Sorry there, pal.

803
01:01:28,115 --> 01:01:29,835
I didn't figure her for much of a shot.

804
01:01:30,035 --> 01:01:33,075
Can you give me word
about Ted's condition?

805
01:01:33,275 --> 01:01:36,676
<i>Yes, I understand
it's a lower body injury.</i>

806
01:01:36,876 --> 01:01:40,276
<i>Somewhere around
the buttock area.</i>

807
01:01:40,476 --> 01:01:43,276
<i>Some said the shooting
might be a lover's vendetta...</i>

808
01:01:43,476 --> 01:01:45,717
<i>...or that the woman is deranged.</i>

809
01:01:47,877 --> 01:01:51,397
Oh, that's great.
The lead story on the news is my ass.

810
01:01:56,398 --> 01:01:58,598
So you should sign off
on the spring mount there.

811
01:01:58,798 --> 01:02:00,358
All right.

812
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:11,800
Very good.

813
01:02:19,881 --> 01:02:21,561
Bobbie.

814
01:02:35,283 --> 01:02:36,603
How you doing?

815
01:02:36,803 --> 01:02:39,923
- I'm okay, how are you doing?
- Okay.

816
01:02:40,123 --> 01:02:42,003
You baked?

817
01:02:42,643 --> 01:02:45,044
Yes, I don't really bake...

818
01:02:45,244 --> 01:02:48,444
...but it seems to be the thing
that people do around here.

819
01:02:48,884 --> 01:02:52,685
- I'm sorry, again.
- Oh, cake.

820
01:02:53,285 --> 01:02:55,605
- Now you decide to show up?
- Hi, Bobbie.

821
01:02:58,125 --> 01:03:01,486
- I think that means she forgives you.
- Okay.

822
01:03:02,166 --> 01:03:03,806
Why don't you come in?

823
01:03:05,686 --> 01:03:07,246
Mr. Arling on the line.

824
01:03:07,446 --> 01:03:09,406
Oh, good.

825
01:03:10,527 --> 01:03:12,687
Hey, did you look over the proposal?

826
01:03:12,887 --> 01:03:15,167
I know I can work
with the existing equipment.

827
01:03:16,967 --> 01:03:19,928
What do you mean, no product line?

828
01:03:20,128 --> 01:03:23,888
You can't just decide like that.
I need to be in that meeting.

829
01:03:25,888 --> 01:03:27,489
I understand.

830
01:03:27,689 --> 01:03:29,369
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.

831
01:03:31,449 --> 01:03:34,209
Blanche, I need to get
on the first flight to Miami.

832
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:40,170
I'm gonna need
my alternate production figures.

833
01:03:40,370 --> 01:03:42,570
They'll be in the confidential file
in my desk.

834
01:03:42,770 --> 01:03:44,491
The key is in the center drawer.

835
01:03:44,691 --> 01:03:48,011
<i>- Okey-dokey artichokie.
- Thank you.</i>

836
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:24,295
The Rocket Bars test markets
are tanking.

837
01:04:24,495 --> 01:04:25,855
We're dumping the product line.

838
01:04:27,416 --> 01:04:28,376
And the plant.

839
01:04:28,576 --> 01:04:31,616
Because it's worth more
to this company dead than alive.

840
01:04:32,176 --> 01:04:33,136
Well, I disagree.

841
01:04:33,336 --> 01:04:35,456
- That would be a terrible mistake.
- Lucy.

842
01:04:35,657 --> 01:04:37,417
The people of New Ulm
are hardworking...

843
01:04:37,617 --> 01:04:40,817
...and they could create an opportunity
that we should take advantage of.

844
01:04:41,017 --> 01:04:42,697
Rocket Bars were the opportunity.

845
01:04:42,897 --> 01:04:44,858
Well, then we'll reformulate
and rename them.

846
01:04:45,058 --> 01:04:46,618
And we'll strategize with...

847
01:04:46,818 --> 01:04:49,138
The product line is dead,
and so is the plant.

848
01:04:49,338 --> 01:04:51,738
We can't just write
these people's livelihoods off.

849
01:04:51,938 --> 01:04:53,259
Lucy.

850
01:04:54,299 --> 01:04:55,859
That's enough.

851
01:04:59,979 --> 01:05:01,980
We need a timetable for shutdown.

852
01:05:02,180 --> 01:05:03,540
We'll keep a skeleton crew on...

853
01:05:03,740 --> 01:05:06,620
...until we move any remaining
physical assets off-site.

854
01:05:34,503 --> 01:05:36,104
Blanche.

855
01:05:37,984 --> 01:05:40,064
You never said anything about layoffs.

856
01:05:40,744 --> 01:05:42,424
Oh, no.

857
01:05:42,624 --> 01:05:44,745
I made that a long time ago.

858
01:05:44,945 --> 01:05:46,665
I made that list
before I even knew you.

859
01:05:46,865 --> 01:05:49,785
And that's okay? It's okay
to pull the rug out from under folks...

860
01:05:49,985 --> 01:05:52,065
...as long as it's nobody
that you know?

861
01:05:52,265 --> 01:05:54,946
It's okay because we're just
silly Podunk Minnesotans, right?

862
01:05:55,146 --> 01:05:57,386
We talk funny and we ice-fish
and we scrapbook...

863
01:05:57,586 --> 01:06:00,706
...and we drag Jesus
into regular conversation.

864
01:06:00,906 --> 01:06:04,987
We're not cool like you, right?
So we don't matter.

865
01:06:05,787 --> 01:06:10,348
And it's okay to lie as long as you're
just pretending to be my friend.

866
01:06:10,548 --> 01:06:14,708
I didn't lie. I just didn't tell you.

867
01:06:14,908 --> 01:06:17,788
Well, I mean it is the same thing.

868
01:06:19,149 --> 01:06:20,629
I guess I lied.

869
01:06:21,389 --> 01:06:25,149
But I wasn't pretending, Blanche.
You are my friend.

870
01:06:26,829 --> 01:06:28,710
Folks need to know, you know?

871
01:06:28,910 --> 01:06:31,510
They need to be able to file protests
with the union.

872
01:06:32,750 --> 01:06:36,071
- Ted.
- I had to tell him.

873
01:06:36,271 --> 01:06:39,231
Maybe you can keep
that kind of thing secret, but I can't.

874
01:06:41,391 --> 01:06:43,111
Blanche, it gets so much worse.

875
01:06:43,311 --> 01:06:45,352
Oh, yeah, what could be worse?

876
01:06:47,992 --> 01:06:51,792
I just found out in Miami
that they wanna close the plant.

877
01:06:55,313 --> 01:06:58,073
I know that this is gonna sound
like a hollow promise to you...

878
01:06:58,273 --> 01:07:00,873
...but I'm determined
to figure something out.

879
01:07:01,073 --> 01:07:03,914
I really am. I mean,
there has to be something, right?

880
01:07:04,114 --> 01:07:08,994
I just... You just can't eliminate
people's livelihoods, you know?

881
01:07:09,834 --> 01:07:12,595
Sure you can.
It happens all the time.

882
01:07:18,916 --> 01:07:21,636
Look, this doesn't mean
that we're friends or anything...

883
01:07:21,836 --> 01:07:23,436
...but when I get upset, I cook.

884
01:07:23,636 --> 01:07:26,916
And right now, me and Harve
are up to our ears in tapioca.

885
01:07:27,116 --> 01:07:28,717
So there you go, okay?

886
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:55,800
Ted.

887
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:03,241
Is it true?

888
01:08:06,841 --> 01:08:09,441
Then we ain't got nothing to say.

889
01:08:56,047 --> 01:08:57,687
Don't leave.

890
01:08:58,607 --> 01:09:02,648
- Please, I need you here.
- To type pink slips?

891
01:09:02,848 --> 01:09:05,888
Besides what's another couple
of months gonna make a difference?

892
01:09:06,088 --> 01:09:08,008
I hope so.

893
01:09:08,208 --> 01:09:11,849
Hey, let's talk tapioca.

894
01:09:12,369 --> 01:09:14,009
Okay.

895
01:09:16,289 --> 01:09:17,769
Go ahead.

896
01:09:39,532 --> 01:09:40,812
Hi there.

897
01:09:41,012 --> 01:09:43,652
We're doing market research today
on a new product...

898
01:09:43,852 --> 01:09:48,893
...called Power Pack Protein Pudding
with Fortified Zappy-oca.

899
01:09:49,093 --> 01:09:53,253
That's your fourth sample already.
That's enough Zappy-oca for you.

900
01:09:53,453 --> 01:09:55,534
Keep them coming, Lucy.
It's like a stampede.

901
01:09:55,734 --> 01:09:59,254
Go ahead.
If you like it, just put in "I like it".

902
01:09:59,454 --> 01:10:01,654
Put a little nutmeg on top if you like.

903
01:10:01,854 --> 01:10:03,535
And if you don't like, don't do it.

904
01:10:05,255 --> 01:10:09,535
<i>Every lassie, a champion skier
of the first water.</i>

905
01:10:13,056 --> 01:10:16,216
<i>That's called the forward squat.</i>

906
01:10:21,297 --> 01:10:23,257
What the hell are you doing here?

907
01:10:23,977 --> 01:10:25,617
I'm here to see Stu.

908
01:10:25,817 --> 01:10:28,098
What the hell are you doing here,
Flo?

909
01:10:28,298 --> 01:10:30,098
I live here.

910
01:10:30,498 --> 01:10:33,578
Hey, Stanley.

911
01:10:33,938 --> 01:10:36,058
Annie Oakley's here.

912
01:10:37,579 --> 01:10:40,139
You and Flo.

913
01:10:40,699 --> 01:10:42,459
Yeah, no...

914
01:10:42,659 --> 01:10:48,100
Yeah, she's my ex-wife
and this is my ex-house.

915
01:10:48,300 --> 01:10:52,020
And now I pay rent
to live in my ex-basement.

916
01:10:53,380 --> 01:10:55,821
Ain't that a kick in the keister?

917
01:10:57,421 --> 01:11:01,221
So let's get back to that part
about you giving me my old job back.

918
01:11:02,902 --> 01:11:04,542
Corporate is shutting down
the plant.

919
01:11:06,782 --> 01:11:09,022
Goddang...

920
01:11:10,222 --> 01:11:11,943
- But...
- I knew this was gonna happen.

921
01:11:12,143 --> 01:11:14,343
- I have a plan.
- What is going on down there?

922
01:11:14,543 --> 01:11:17,663
None of your damn business,
you nosy old hoot owl!

923
01:11:25,024 --> 01:11:26,904
We've come up with a new product.

924
01:11:27,104 --> 01:11:29,705
If we can produce it
and test-market it in four weeks...

925
01:11:29,905 --> 01:11:33,625
...well, then we can prove to corporate
that this plant is still worthwhile.

926
01:11:34,505 --> 01:11:35,705
A month?

927
01:11:39,786 --> 01:11:41,666
What? That's impossible.

928
01:11:43,546 --> 01:11:47,107
I mean, you're just gonna get
everybody's hopes up...

929
01:11:47,307 --> 01:11:49,467
...and then they'll all end up
out of work anyway.

930
01:11:50,547 --> 01:11:54,228
- See, I think...
- No, I am not taking the fall for that.

931
01:11:56,028 --> 01:11:57,548
You're on your own, lady.

932
01:12:15,310 --> 01:12:17,230
So that's the plan,
and to make it work...

933
01:12:17,430 --> 01:12:20,511
...we're gonna recommission
the old-fashioned yogurt equipment.

934
01:12:20,711 --> 01:12:22,351
It's gonna take a lot of long hours.

935
01:12:22,551 --> 01:12:24,991
How much overtime
are you authorized for?

936
01:12:25,191 --> 01:12:26,151
None.

937
01:12:26,351 --> 01:12:27,871
And if the Munck-ees don't buy it?

938
01:12:28,071 --> 01:12:32,312
We'll put in a whole lot of work
and end up out on our asses anyway.

939
01:12:32,472 --> 01:12:36,432
Yeah, yeah, I'm not gonna lie to you.
The odds are that's what will happen.

940
01:12:36,632 --> 01:12:37,993
But if it's any consolation...

941
01:12:38,193 --> 01:12:41,793
...I'm gonna be out of a job
right alongside the rest of you.

942
01:12:41,993 --> 01:12:45,554
I mean,
I am betting my career on this.

943
01:12:46,274 --> 01:12:48,994
Why? I don't know.

944
01:12:49,194 --> 01:12:50,954
When I came here
did I think that this...

945
01:12:51,154 --> 01:12:53,474
...was gonna matter this much? No.

946
01:12:53,914 --> 01:12:57,235
But does it matter? Yeah.

947
01:12:57,795 --> 01:13:01,435
Yeah, absolutely. It matters a lot.

948
01:13:06,356 --> 01:13:10,316
And you can sure betcha we'll be out
on our asses if we don't try.

949
01:13:12,477 --> 01:13:14,997
You got something
better to do there, Lars?

950
01:13:15,397 --> 01:13:18,197
And I gotta say I don't exactly
picture prospective employers...

951
01:13:18,397 --> 01:13:20,918
...lining up to fight over
a dumb son of a bitch like Bob.

952
01:13:26,918 --> 01:13:31,279
They might padlock this place,
let the whole town come to rust.

953
01:13:32,959 --> 01:13:36,039
But if that's the way it goes,
I don't wanna be thinking...

954
01:13:36,239 --> 01:13:40,360
...this gal offered a chance
and I didn't do a thing about it.

955
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,880
You can count me in.

956
01:14:28,806 --> 01:14:30,766
They teach you that
in your management books?

957
01:14:32,446 --> 01:14:35,606
Is this a surprise compliance visit
from the union?

958
01:14:35,806 --> 01:14:39,047
Maybe.
I heard about what you're doing.

959
01:14:43,527 --> 01:14:48,368
Look, I'm not sure why I came here,
but maybe I can help.

960
01:14:58,209 --> 01:15:01,729
Crank it a little bit more.
Yup, crank it, a little bit more.

961
01:15:03,330 --> 01:15:05,330
All right, Bob, turn her on.

962
01:15:07,050 --> 01:15:08,770
Hold it. Turn her off, Bob.

963
01:15:08,970 --> 01:15:11,010
- Great.
- Hang on, trade me spots here, Ted.

964
01:15:11,210 --> 01:15:12,771
Okay, go on, get in there.

965
01:15:13,331 --> 01:15:15,931
- Okay, let's do this other one.
- All right.

966
01:15:16,131 --> 01:15:17,611
Turn it on, please.

967
01:15:17,811 --> 01:15:19,851
Put it off, Bob.

968
01:15:23,412 --> 01:15:24,372
That's funny?

969
01:15:26,132 --> 01:15:27,972
- No, no, no.
- Yeah, that's funny though.

970
01:15:28,172 --> 01:15:30,653
Yeah, all right.
Bob, do me a favor, please turn it on.

971
01:15:52,975 --> 01:15:57,656
And I swear never to reveal
Blanche's secret tapioca recipe...

972
01:15:57,856 --> 01:16:03,657
...to anyone from a rival company
or to Trudy Van Uuden.

973
01:16:05,017 --> 01:16:06,817
I swear.

974
01:16:52,862 --> 01:16:55,223
Mr. Arling
from the home office on line one.

975
01:16:55,383 --> 01:16:57,783
And if you ask me,
he doesn't sound any too pleased.

976
01:17:05,504 --> 01:17:08,424
Donald, funny you should call.

977
01:17:27,866 --> 01:17:28,946
Yes, yes, Donald.

978
01:17:29,147 --> 01:17:33,507
I do realize that I did this
with absolutely no authorization.

979
01:17:33,707 --> 01:17:35,067
Don't think I'm not pissed.

980
01:17:35,267 --> 01:17:38,428
You'd be out on your ass if those
regional tests weren't off the charts.

981
01:17:38,628 --> 01:17:42,548
It doesn't hurt that Wallace's
grandkids are big on the butterscotch.

982
01:17:44,788 --> 01:17:46,148
This is Blanche Gunderson.

983
01:17:46,349 --> 01:17:47,989
She's our head
of Product Development.

984
01:17:48,189 --> 01:17:50,709
Oh, heavens no, I'm just...

985
01:17:50,909 --> 01:17:53,309
Oh, I'm pleased as punch
to meet you.

986
01:17:53,509 --> 01:17:55,390
- Yeah.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

987
01:17:55,590 --> 01:17:57,230
- It's all right, it's okay.
- Oh, dear.

988
01:17:57,430 --> 01:17:59,070
Yeah, yeah.

989
01:17:59,270 --> 01:18:03,150
Well, they never would have thought
it would be more cost-effective...

990
01:18:03,350 --> 01:18:07,751
...to use the current labor force and
the old machine line than robotics...

991
01:18:07,951 --> 01:18:09,871
...but we showed them.

992
01:18:10,071 --> 01:18:11,551
They want to ramp up production...

993
01:18:11,751 --> 01:18:14,632
...and ship nationally
by the end of the month.

994
01:18:19,872 --> 01:18:22,433
How does it feel
to be the newest vice president?

995
01:18:22,633 --> 01:18:25,273
We'll expect you in Miami
next week.

996
01:18:42,075 --> 01:18:44,075
- Hey.
- Hi.

997
01:18:44,275 --> 01:18:45,715
- How you doing?
- I'm all right.

998
01:18:45,915 --> 01:18:48,676
- How are you?
- I'm all right.

999
01:18:48,836 --> 01:18:51,396
It's real noisy in there so...

1000
01:18:52,036 --> 01:18:55,997
I thought I'd tell you goodbye
out here.

1001
01:18:58,077 --> 01:19:02,277
You know, you've done some
pretty amazing things around here.

1002
01:19:02,477 --> 01:19:04,278
Thank you.

1003
01:19:06,918 --> 01:19:10,478
Everybody in this whole town
is really gonna miss you a lot.

1004
01:19:14,839 --> 01:19:16,319
Especially me.

1005
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:26,880
There's people in there
waiting to give you a sendoff.

1006
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:30,241
You don't want to miss that.
You may wanna...

1007
01:19:32,361 --> 01:19:34,081
Yeah.

1008
01:19:49,723 --> 01:19:53,083
- So I'll see you...
- Yeah, I'll be in there in a while.

1009
01:19:53,923 --> 01:19:55,324
Okay.

1010
01:20:28,727 --> 01:20:31,408
It'll be nice getting back
to civilization.

1011
01:20:32,248 --> 01:20:34,088
How do people live here?

1012
01:22:21,220 --> 01:22:23,501
How many queens
did you plant in this deck, Maurice?

1013
01:22:23,701 --> 01:22:26,301
Four or five, give or take a couple.

1014
01:22:27,861 --> 01:22:29,341
Hey, fellas.

1015
01:22:30,302 --> 01:22:33,182
Ted, we gotta talk.

1016
01:22:37,662 --> 01:22:39,583
Hey, Nina,
give me a Maker's Mark.

1017
01:22:42,623 --> 01:22:47,104
Well, it looks like we're just
too successful for our own damn good.

1018
01:22:47,504 --> 01:22:51,464
Just got wind from Fagerbache
in Distribution, the plant's being sold.

1019
01:22:51,664 --> 01:22:54,944
Some muckety-muck from HQ
is coming to tell us about it.

1020
01:22:55,104 --> 01:22:56,505
Sold?

1021
01:22:56,705 --> 01:22:58,465
Yeah, it's a heck of a deal.

1022
01:22:58,665 --> 01:23:01,025
They're gonna move
our product line out of here.

1023
01:23:01,225 --> 01:23:03,905
Faster than thin shit
through a tall Swede.

1024
01:23:04,105 --> 01:23:07,066
I'm surprised your little sweetie-pie
vice president...

1025
01:23:07,266 --> 01:23:09,506
...didn't send you the memo.

1026
01:23:23,908 --> 01:23:25,108
So ridiculous.

1027
01:23:25,308 --> 01:23:28,508
It was my secret, now it's being
shipped off with the plant.

1028
01:23:40,430 --> 01:23:42,790
Yeah, well, I'm not gonna accept
anything less...

1029
01:23:42,950 --> 01:23:45,830
...than two weeks' salary
for every year worked.

1030
01:24:14,834 --> 01:24:16,274
I understand that you've heard...

1031
01:24:16,474 --> 01:24:19,754
...of Munck Foods' planned sale
of this facility.

1032
01:24:20,314 --> 01:24:21,795
Yeah.

1033
01:24:23,595 --> 01:24:26,955
Well, I've assembled
some industrial investors...

1034
01:24:27,555 --> 01:24:31,356
...to back us in buying this plant,
product line and all.

1035
01:24:31,556 --> 01:24:34,276
At a fixed rate,
you'll buy the new company back...

1036
01:24:34,476 --> 01:24:38,276
...until it is entirely owner-operated.

1037
01:24:39,717 --> 01:24:41,917
Well, how do we know
we can we trust these guys?

1038
01:24:42,117 --> 01:24:43,357
Yeah.

1039
01:24:44,317 --> 01:24:46,077
You won't have to.

1040
01:24:47,117 --> 01:24:49,118
You can trust me.

1041
01:24:50,838 --> 01:24:54,638
I wanna come back
as this company's CEO.

1042
01:24:54,838 --> 01:24:57,759
Well, would you look at Miss CEO?

1043
01:24:57,959 --> 01:25:01,199
As I recall, first,
you got us to risk everything.

1044
01:25:01,399 --> 01:25:05,080
Then you left us behind, you know?

1045
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:08,040
And then you got them...

1046
01:25:08,240 --> 01:25:10,680
...to buy the company
out right from under our feet.

1047
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:13,120
And now you have this idea...

1048
01:25:13,321 --> 01:25:15,721
...about how we're supposed
to buy our own company back.

1049
01:25:15,921 --> 01:25:17,361
Well, that changes everything.

1050
01:25:19,921 --> 01:25:22,802
Are you prepared
to deal with the union on this?

1051
01:25:29,722 --> 01:25:32,443
I'm sure we could come
to some agreement.

1052
01:25:33,163 --> 01:25:36,523
It's gonna take a little bit of time too,
it might take years.

1053
01:25:41,524 --> 01:25:43,684
My schedule's open.

1054
01:25:54,605 --> 01:25:57,806
- Whoa, there, buddy, you're not...
- Hey, I just have something in my eye.

1055
01:25:58,006 --> 01:25:59,446
Damn it.

1056
01:26:36,650 --> 01:26:38,210
Now...

1057
01:26:38,970 --> 01:26:40,771
What about Johann Weinkopf?

1058
01:26:41,451 --> 01:26:43,611
Why, he'd make you
a mighty fine husband.

1059
01:26:43,811 --> 01:26:44,771
He's got a lazy eye.

1060
01:26:44,971 --> 01:26:49,012
And I can never tell if he's looking
directly at me or my breast.

1061
01:26:49,212 --> 01:26:51,372
Probably looking at both.

1062
01:26:51,972 --> 01:26:54,332
Now that I think about it,
you're probably right.

1063
01:26:54,732 --> 01:26:55,932
Go on.

1064
01:26:57,093 --> 01:26:59,253
- Oh, hi there, Peter.
- Here you go.

1065
01:27:05,374 --> 01:27:06,814
- So...
- Okay, then.

1066
01:27:07,014 --> 01:27:08,974
- You have a nice day.
- Enjoy the weather.

1067
01:27:09,174 --> 01:27:11,094
- You too.
- Thank you much.
