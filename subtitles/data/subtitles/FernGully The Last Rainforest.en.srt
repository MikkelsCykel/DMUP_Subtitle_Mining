Our world was much larger then.

5
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:08,992
The forest went on forever.

6
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:13,836
We tree spirits nurtured the harmony
of all living things,

7
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:17,274
but our closest friends
were humans.

8
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:24,372
Then, as sometimes happens,
the balance of nature shifted,

9
00:01:26,352 --> 00:01:29,810
and Hexxus...
the very spirit of destruction...

10
00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:32,187
rose up from the bowels
of the earth...

11
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:35,421
and rained down his poison.

12
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:38,089
The forest was nearly destroyed.

13
00:01:38,164 --> 00:01:42,328
Many lives were lost,
and the humans fled in fear,

14
00:01:42,402 --> 00:01:44,563
never to return.

15
00:01:44,637 --> 00:01:48,437
Most think they didn't survive.

16
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:55,973
It was only by calling up
the magical powers of nature...

17
00:01:56,049 --> 00:02:00,008
that I was able to trap Hexxus
inside an enchanted tree...

18
00:02:00,086 --> 00:02:03,715
and save FernGully.

19
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:08,989
Which is why it is so important
for you to learn to use these powers.

- Magi, yes. The secrets.

26
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:34,580
I know. But, I mean,
it's all right now.

27
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:39,091
That was so long ago, and you trapped
him in that tree and everything, so...

28
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:43,323
I really have to go now,

- Okay, what's the password?
- Oh, come on, you guys.

- Is that the password?

Magi? Magi.

73
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:47,132
Oh, Magi, I just saw the most
incredible thing above the canopy.

74
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:50,004
A whole other world.
The sky went on forever.

75
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,544
And way over in the distance
as far as I could see,

76
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:55,046
there was this enormous rock
like a...

77
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:59,107
Mountain.
That was Mount Warning.

78
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:03,349
And next to it was a... a...
I don't know.

79
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:07,382
It looked like a strange black cloud
rising out of the earth.

80
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,987
- Smoke, I should think.
- What's smoke?

81
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:14,658
Oh, there are many things in our world
you don't yet know about, Crysta.

82
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:20,672
There are worlds
within worlds, Crysta.

83
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:28,308
Everything in our world
is connected by the delicate
strands of the web of life,

84
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:33,318
which is balanced
between forces of destruction...

85
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:37,220
and the magic forces
of creation.

86
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,894
Help it grow.

87
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:58,369
Why can't I do it?

88
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:13,657
Everyone can call on
the magic powers of the web of life.

89
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:17,423
You have to find it
in yourself.

90
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:22,022
I want to, Magi.
You know I do.

91
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:26,827
But I was thinking
about that smoke.

92
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:30,137
Do you think
it could be... Hexxus?

93
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:32,575
No, there isn't a force in
nature that could release him,

94
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:34,943
and there are no poisons here
on which he can feed.

95
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:38,609
Hexxus is trapped
for all time.

96
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,653
Now that's enough for today.

97
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:45,213
- But what could have caused the smoke?
- Now, now, now, off with you.

98
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,225
But, Magi...

99
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:06,911

have to say, huh?

- 'Bout time.

Oh, Father,
do you think it's possible?

00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,711
Could humans still exist?

Now, Crysta. Ooh!

161
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:14,783
Don't you think you're a little old
to believe in human tales?

162
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,693
Human tails?
Humans don't have tails.

163
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:20,197
They have big, big bottoms
that they wear with bad shorts.

164
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:22,291
They walk around going,
"Hi, Helen!"

Hey!
Where are you going?

Yeah, this territory
looks kinda familiar.

Fabulous day in the canopy,
isn't it?

171
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,663

For a minute I thought you said
you were going to Mount Warning.

Well, I did.

175

You think nature did this?

179
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:25,489
Do you think I put this in
to get better reception?

180
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:27,794
No! Humans did this.

181
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:31,496
We should stay here.
It's nice here.

182

I can't go on. Help me!
My little wings can't make it.

188
00:15:03,734 --> 00:15:06,498
Maybe you should
wait here for me.

189
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:09,698
This is a fabulous idea.
I really think we should fly with that.

Only, why don't you
stay here with me?

00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:31,293
But Magi Lune will fix you.

309
00:25:31,361 --> 00:25:33,955
You shrank me?

310
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:36,498
- Yeah.
- Catches on quick, doesn't he?

311
00:25:36,566 --> 00:25:39,899
- We better buzz off. It's getting late.
- "Buzz off'?

312
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:43,599
I'm not buzzing anywhere.
Now, unshrink me, and I mean now!

313
00:25:43,673 --> 00:25:46,904
- Well, I guess I could
take a bash at it.
- "Take a bash"?

314
00:25:46,977 --> 00:25:49,104
Actually,
I'm just sort of learning.

315
00:25:49,179 --> 00:25:51,909
Great! I've been shrunk
by an amateur.

316
00:25:51,982 --> 00:25:54,507
I don't believe this.
Okay, come on. Bash away.

317
00:25:54,584 --> 00:25:58,816
Okay!
What was done, now undo.

318
00:25:58,888 --> 00:26:01,186
Return you to
the form that's true.

319

[Grunts, Moans]

320
00:26:03,994 --> 00:26:08,055
Oh, oh, oh, big ears.
Elephant! No, no, no.

321
00:26:08,131 --> 00:26:10,827
Anteater! Orangutan!

322
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:15,769
Okay, okay, let me guess.
A duck! A duck!
Oh, it's Darwin's grab bag!

323
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:18,967
- [Zak Panting]
- Uh, let me try again.

324
00:26:19,042 --> 00:26:22,739
- Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!
- No, no, no!

325
00:26:22,812 --> 00:26:26,976
Thank you, but I think maybe
we better go see this Magi.

326
00:26:29,352 --> 00:26:31,286
I'm Zak.

327
00:26:32,355 --> 00:26:35,688
- I'm Crysta.
- Nice to meet you.

328
00:26:37,327 --> 00:26:39,420
You're going to love FernGully.

329
00:26:39,496 --> 00:26:43,091
It's the most beautiful,
wonderful place in the forest.

330
00:26:43,166 --> 00:26:45,293
Well, come on.
Batty can carry you.

331
00:26:45,368 --> 00:26:48,565
Moi? Uh-uh.
Not this little mammal.

332
00:26:48,638 --> 00:26:52,369
Fly a human?
I'd rather suck wax fruit.

333
00:27:01,885 --> 00:27:03,819
- Hey, Tony.
- What?

334
00:27:03,887 --> 00:27:05,821
You see Zak anywhere?

335
00:27:05,889 --> 00:27:08,687
No, his shift's about over.
He probably cut out early.

336
00:27:08,758 --> 00:27:12,023
That's the problem with
the world today. People are lazy.

337
00:27:12,095 --> 00:27:14,689
I heard that
with my bad ear.

338
00:27:18,768 --> 00:27:22,363
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.
What is that?

339
00:27:22,439 --> 00:27:25,272
Hey, Tony, you think the leveler
can handle this baby?

340
00:27:25,342 --> 00:27:29,870
- Sure. That leveler eats everything.
- Kinda like you.

341
00:27:31,147 --> 00:27:33,547
How many times a day
I gotta threaten your life?

342

[Munching, Slurping]

346
00:28:49,192 --> 00:28:51,660
[Crysta] I've got so many things
I want to ask you.

347
00:28:51,728 --> 00:28:54,663
Like, why have humans
returned to the forest?

348
00:28:54,731 --> 00:28:58,690
And what was that monster
that tried to eat you?

349
00:28:58,768 --> 00:29:01,931
That wasn't a monster.

350
00:29:02,005 --> 00:29:05,372
That was a machine.

351
00:29:05,442 --> 00:29:07,376
What's a "machine"?

352
00:29:07,444 --> 00:29:12,143
It's a... a thing...
for cutting down trees.

353
00:29:12,215 --> 00:29:14,149
That's terrible.

354
00:29:14,217 --> 00:29:16,310
[Chuckling]
Only if you live in a tree.

355
00:29:16,386 --> 00:29:18,684
I do live in a tree.

356
00:29:19,856 --> 00:29:21,790
Oh.

357
00:29:21,858 --> 00:29:27,319
You didn't have anything
to do with that "machine," did you?

358
00:29:27,397 --> 00:29:29,797
Uh, what, me?

359
00:29:31,534 --> 00:29:34,230
No. No, no.
No, of course not.

360
00:29:35,638 --> 00:29:37,572
[Grunts]
Oops.

361
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:42,202
How could I have anything to do
with something that eats trees?

362
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:45,213
Could it come to FernGully?

363
00:29:45,281 --> 00:29:48,546
Oh, no, no. Of course not.
You've got nothing to worry about.

364
00:29:48,618 --> 00:29:53,715
- Why?
- Because, um, it's trapped.
[Chuckles Nervously]

365
00:29:54,724 --> 00:29:58,524
Oh, I know.
By those red marks.

366
00:29:58,595 --> 00:30:01,621
- It can't go past them.
Well, they must be magic.
- Yeah!

367
00:30:01,698 --> 00:30:04,501
[Laughs Nervously]
You know, you're pretty smart, fairy.

00:30:05,502 --> 00:30:07,697
I want to learn
magic like yours.

It's fire.

Oh, what is
this delightful thing,

379
00:31:34,057 --> 00:31:36,855
and how did I get
out of that tree?

380
00:31:37,927 --> 00:31:41,454
Of course... humans.

So clever, so helpful.

New orders, boys.

You're going to FernGully,

387
00:32:05,054 --> 00:32:07,386
and I want you there
by morning.

388

By morning?

Uh, I don't know
if we can do that.

390
00:32:11,894 --> 00:32:14,055
You'll just
have to work harder, then.

391
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:18,032
Double shifts. No breaks.

392
00:32:18,101 --> 00:32:20,331
No breaks?

393
00:32:20,403 --> 00:32:24,499
And make sure you got
plenty of oil.

We'll give her the gas.

Yeah, or she's somebody else's dinner.

What are the trees like where you live?

Not like this.
I live in a city.

448
00:35:59,922 --> 00:36:02,186
"City"?

449
00:36:02,258 --> 00:36:05,523
Yeah... buildings,

traffic, roads,

- Easy.
- But trees give life.

455
00:36:22,178 --> 00:36:24,874
They make the clouds,
the rain, the air.

456

00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:47,032
[Music]It's raining like magic [music]

464
00:36:47,103 --> 00:36:49,571
[Music]It's falling like starlight [music]

465
00:36:49,639 --> 00:36:52,506
[Music]It's raining like magic [music]

466
00:36:52,575 --> 00:36:54,736
[Music]It's raining life [music]

467
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:56,971
[Music] The forest is breathing [music]

468
00:36:57,046 --> 00:36:59,571
[Music]And ferns are rejoicing [music]

469
00:36:59,649 --> 00:37:01,810
[Music] The trees are all singing [music]

470
00:37:01,884 --> 00:37:04,478
[Music]Hey, it's raining life [music]

471
00:37:04,553 --> 00:37:07,488
[Chorus]
[Music]Raining like magic [music]

472
00:37:08,991 --> 00:37:14,054
[Music]La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
It's raining life [music]

473
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:18,328
So what about you, Crysta?
I mean, what do fairies do anyway?

474
00:37:18,401 --> 00:37:20,926
- "Do"?
- Yeah, I mean,
do you have jobs or anything?

475
00:37:21,003 --> 00:37:23,528
What-What's a job?

476
00:37:23,606 --> 00:37:26,302
Guess that answers
that question.

477
00:37:26,375 --> 00:37:28,502
Look, um,
what do you do all day?

478
00:37:28,577 --> 00:37:31,876
- Mm, help things grow.
- Yeah? That sounds cool.

479
00:37:31,948 --> 00:37:33,973
No, usually it's warm.

480
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:36,610
- No, no. Cool means hot.
- What?

481
00:37:36,686 --> 00:37:41,453
Yeah. You know...
bodacious, bad, tubular.

482
00:37:41,524 --> 00:37:43,822
Awesome use
of the language, dude.

483
00:37:43,893 --> 00:37:46,157
As in,

484
00:37:46,228 --> 00:37:48,890
"You are
one bodacious babe."

485
00:37:48,965 --> 00:37:51,490
And that's good.
I mean cool.

486
00:37:51,567 --> 00:37:55,469
- [Zak] Yeah.
We're communicating now.
- [Snoring]

487
00:37:55,538 --> 00:37:57,472
[Crysta]
Tubular.

488
00:37:59,942 --> 00:38:01,876
[Chopping]

489
00:38:03,913 --> 00:38:05,972
[Chopping Continues]

490
00:38:11,721 --> 00:38:13,985
Morning!

491
00:38:18,561 --> 00:38:20,495
- [Gasps]
- What are you doing?

492
00:38:20,563 --> 00:38:24,499
Carving your name.
See? C-R-Y-S...

493
00:38:24,567 --> 00:38:28,298
No, no, you mustn't do that.
Here.

494
00:38:29,605 --> 00:38:32,199
- Can't you feel its pain?
- "Its pain"?

495
00:38:32,274 --> 00:38:36,005
- [Crysta] Yes.
- Humans can't feel anything...
they're numb from the brain down.

496
00:38:36,078 --> 00:38:38,239
Oh, Zak.

497
00:38:40,182 --> 00:38:42,776
He doesn't understand.

498
00:38:42,852 --> 00:38:44,786
[Sighs]

499
00:38:45,988 --> 00:38:47,922
Did I say something wrong?

500
00:38:51,427 --> 00:38:55,056
So, uh, which way
to FernGully?

501
00:39:01,637 --> 00:39:04,128
- [Grunting]
- Oh!

502
00:39:04,206 --> 00:39:06,640
[Laughing]

503
00:39:19,388 --> 00:39:21,322
[Zak Laughing]

504
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:23,324
Isn't this great?

505
00:39:28,064 --> 00:39:30,328
Wow!

506
00:39:33,936 --> 00:39:37,463
- What is this place?
- This is FernGully.

507
00:39:40,209 --> 00:39:42,905
[Yelling]

508
00:39:42,978 --> 00:39:45,503
- Hey, Crysta, what's this?
- [Yells]

509
00:39:45,581 --> 00:39:48,243
Careful, Stump.
He's a human.

510
00:39:48,317 --> 00:39:51,980
- Hey!
- Hey, how does it taste?

511
00:39:56,058 --> 00:39:58,993
- A "hoo-man"?
- Is this what we're lookin'for?

512
00:39:59,061 --> 00:40:02,030
- Let go of me!
- [Yells, Indistinct]

513
00:40:02,098 --> 00:40:05,261
- Crysta!
- Hey, that's my human!

514
00:40:05,334 --> 00:40:07,268
Hey!

515
00:40:10,739 --> 00:40:12,673
Oh, no!

516
00:40:15,978 --> 00:40:18,970
I'm blind! Oh, no!

517
00:40:19,048 --> 00:40:21,983
I can see!
It's a miracle!

518
00:40:22,051 --> 00:40:24,315
Another perfect landing.

519
00:40:24,386 --> 00:40:26,752
No worries. I'm okay.

520
00:40:26,822 --> 00:40:30,121
- Thank you for caring.
It's just a few bruises.
- [Chattering]

521
00:40:31,427 --> 00:40:34,692
- Nobody cares about me.
- I do, bat man.

522
00:40:34,763 --> 00:40:36,663
- You sure?
- I'm positive.

523
00:40:36,732 --> 00:40:39,064
- Only fools are positive.
- Are you sure?

524
00:40:39,135 --> 00:40:41,399
- I'm positive. I fell for it!
- [Chuckling]

525
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:43,404
- I should have known!
- Come on, Zak.

526
00:40:46,575 --> 00:40:49,567
Crysta, we were
so worried about...

527
00:40:49,645 --> 00:40:53,581
- What's that?
- Father, I'd like you to meet Zak.

528
00:40:53,649 --> 00:40:57,050
- Hi.
- He's a bodacious babe.

529
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:00,350
- A what?
- He's a human!

530
00:41:00,422 --> 00:41:03,016
[All Gasp]

531
00:41:03,092 --> 00:41:05,686
[All Chattering]

532
00:41:07,663 --> 00:41:11,531
Somehow I thought they'd be...
bigger.

533
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:15,502
Well, I had a little accident,
and he sort of shrank.

534
00:41:15,571 --> 00:41:18,836
But just think...
humans back in the forest.

535
00:41:18,908 --> 00:41:20,842
Yep, there goes
the neighborhood.

536
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:24,402
- Be nice, Batty.
- First thing, all these trees go.

537
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,847
Then come your highways,
then come your shopping malls
and your parking lots...

538
00:41:27,917 --> 00:41:31,353
and your convenience stores,
and then come...

539
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:35,447
Price check on prune juice, Bob.
Price check on prune juice.

540
00:41:37,259 --> 00:41:41,889
Crysta! Where you been?
I've been looking all over for ya.

541
00:41:41,964 --> 00:41:44,262
Pips, you won't believe
what I found.

542
00:41:44,333 --> 00:41:47,234
Isn't he amazing?

543
00:41:47,303 --> 00:41:49,794
Shouldn't we be charging
admission for this?

544
00:41:49,872 --> 00:41:52,466
That's all you've got to say?
I been out all night,

545
00:41:52,541 --> 00:41:54,805
and you want to show me
this weird creature here?

546
00:41:54,877 --> 00:41:58,472
This "weird creature"
is a human.

547
00:41:58,547 --> 00:42:02,506
Hmm. He's kinda small,
ain't he?

548
00:42:04,386 --> 00:42:07,048
- [Whistles]
- [All Shouting] Look out!

549
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,960
[All Gasp]

550
00:42:20,236 --> 00:42:24,502
Uh, Pips, why don't you tell us
about your strange treasure?

551
00:42:25,908 --> 00:42:29,844
Oh. Well,
it's simple, really.

552
00:42:29,912 --> 00:42:32,005
It's hard like stone,

553
00:42:32,081 --> 00:42:34,982
yet, uh... yet it's hollow.

554
00:42:35,951 --> 00:42:38,351
And, uh, yeah,
it has this, uh...

555
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:40,820
it has this little vine
coming out of it and... and...

556
00:42:40,889 --> 00:42:43,585
It's my stereo.

557
00:42:43,659 --> 00:42:46,628
Look, I found it,
so I'll explain it, all right?

558
00:42:46,695 --> 00:42:48,959
Okay.
Then what is it?

559
00:42:51,166 --> 00:42:53,532
- Well, it's obviously, um...
- [Fairies] Yeah?

560
00:42:53,602 --> 00:42:55,536
Obviously, it's, uh...

- [music] [Rock]
- [Zak] Where are you going?

562
00:43:03,045 --> 00:43:06,845
- It's alive!
- And it's noisy!

563
00:43:06,915 --> 00:43:09,645
It's a recording of music.

564
00:43:09,718 --> 00:43:12,812
Well, I don't know
what a recording is,

565
00:43:12,888 --> 00:43:16,551
but I know what music is,
and that is not music.

566
00:43:16,625 --> 00:43:20,117

We'll give you a taste of real
FernGully wildlife.

596
00:44:55,224 --> 00:44:58,352
Unless, of course,
you're not up to it, "Zap."

597
00:44:58,427 --> 00:45:02,887

Can't you feel its pain?

Magi!

Oh, Magi, I've got
so much to tell you.

656
00:50:18,013 --> 00:50:21,176
I went to Mount Warning,
and I found a human.

Well, come on.
I want you to meet him.

Magi, can you heal it?

660
00:50:48,744 --> 00:50:51,474
A force outside of nature did this.

00:50:51,546 --> 00:50:55,642
I can't heal it,
and I can't stop it.

662

Zak can.
I know what did this, Magi.

A monster the humans fight.
Humans can stop it.

[Gasps]

- You know what's happening, don't you?
- What?

00:52:04,619 --> 00:52:08,487
Good idea. Ask the human.
He may know.

I wish... I wish
the human tales were true.

They're not here
to protect the forest.

They're destroying the forest.

- They're coming this way.

You can't stop them.
You'll have to leave.

Gather everyone in the circle.

You know, Zak, truth doesn't
always win friends,

686
00:53:18,226 --> 00:53:20,751
but it certainly
influences people.

Since the beginning of time,

We have been the guardians

We have too long forgotten
the magic powers of nature.

The time has come
to call on them again.

Look for the hero

Look to the good and loving heart
in you and all others.

So easily detached.

770
01:02:21,434 --> 01:02:24,995
[All Gasping]

771
01:02:28,741 --> 01:02:31,676
[Hexxus]
Yes!

01:02:35,448 --> 01:02:38,576
[Sinister Laughter]

773
01:02:53,799 --> 01:02:57,257
What happened
to the energy?

774
01:03:15,488 --> 01:03:18,423
[Cheering]

775
01:03:53,893 --> 01:03:58,421
[Magi's Voice]
All the magic of creation exists
within a single, tiny seed.

776
01:04:14,747 --> 01:04:17,944
[Sinister Laughter]

777
01:04:21,721 --> 01:04:25,248
- Crysta!
- No! No!

778
01:04:25,324 --> 01:04:26,916
Crysta.

779
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:44,175
[Yelling]

780
01:04:49,014 --> 01:04:50,606
Come on!

781
01:04:53,085 --> 01:04:55,053
Help it grow!

782
01:04:59,592 --> 01:05:01,526
Come on, guys!

783
01:05:04,396 --> 01:05:07,194
- Come on!
- Let's go! Follow me!

784
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:57,544
Oh, Crysta's gone.

785
01:06:03,655 --> 01:06:05,589
Oh, look!

786
01:06:24,876 --> 01:06:27,606
We did it, Zak.

787
01:06:27,679 --> 01:06:31,137
Now Hexxus can never harm
FernGully again.

788
01:06:32,384 --> 01:06:34,318
But humans still could.

789
01:06:35,387 --> 01:06:38,151
That's why I have to go back.

790
01:06:39,691 --> 01:06:42,125
There's a part of me
that really wants to stay.

791
01:06:43,795 --> 01:06:46,764
There's a part of you
that will always stay.

792
01:06:53,839 --> 01:06:56,273
Remember, Zak.

793
01:06:56,341 --> 01:06:58,605
Remember everything.

794
01:07:18,029 --> 01:07:20,122
Keep the stereo, dude.

795
01:07:20,198 --> 01:07:23,099
- Thanks, dude.
- Hey, he's not going already?

796
01:07:23,168 --> 01:07:25,102
He was a nice guy.

797
01:07:25,170 --> 01:07:29,971
- He just needed wings.
- What was done, now undo.

798
01:07:30,041 --> 01:07:32,942
Return you to the form...

799
01:07:33,011 --> 01:07:35,445
that's true.

800
01:07:35,514 --> 01:07:37,846
Good-bye, Zak.

801
01:07:47,592 --> 01:07:49,526
Oh.

802
01:07:53,565 --> 01:07:55,533
Batty.

803
01:07:59,938 --> 01:08:03,032
[Gasps]
I've shrunk!

804
01:08:09,748 --> 01:08:12,546
- Zak!
- What happened here?

805
01:08:29,601 --> 01:08:31,535
I will remember.

806
01:08:38,877 --> 01:08:41,004
Guys, things have gotta change.

807
01:08:42,247 --> 01:08:45,842
[Magi's Voice]
Crysta, help it grow.

808
01:10:14,940 --> 01:10:17,602
