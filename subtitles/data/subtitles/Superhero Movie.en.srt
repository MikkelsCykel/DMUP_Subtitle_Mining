1
00:03:00,904 --> 00:03:03,566
Stop!
Stop the bus!

2
00:03:15,552 --> 00:03:18,146
The story of my life is not
for the faint of heart.

3
00:03:18,188 --> 00:03:20,418
Thanks.

4
00:03:20,457 --> 00:03:22,755
But, like any story
worth telling,

5
00:03:22,793 --> 00:03:24,852
it's all about a girl.

6
00:03:25,863 --> 00:03:28,093
Not that girl.

7
00:03:28,132 --> 00:03:30,930
- Hey. Hi.
- I don't think that is a girl.

8
00:03:30,968 --> 00:03:33,459
No, it's about this girl...

9
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,472
Jill Johnson.

10
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:39,499
Ever since I can remember
I've been in love with her,

11
00:03:39,543 --> 00:03:41,067
but she barely knows
I exist.

12
00:03:41,111 --> 00:03:42,840
Yo, Rick!
Yo, come here, man!

13
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,609
I got you a seat
down here. What's...

14
00:03:44,648 --> 00:03:46,081
I'll call y'all back.
Everybody, bye.

15
00:03:46,116 --> 00:03:47,777
- What's up, man?
- Hey, Trey.

16
00:03:47,818 --> 00:03:49,718
Dude, I'm so psyched
for this class trip.

17
00:03:49,753 --> 00:03:51,721
We about to see some real
serious cutting-edge shit.

18
00:03:51,755 --> 00:03:53,586
Mmm.
Mm-hmm. Mmm.

19
00:03:53,624 --> 00:03:55,251
That's what
I'm talking about.

20
00:03:55,292 --> 00:03:57,283
Yo, you got any C batteries on you?
AAs?

21
00:03:57,327 --> 00:03:59,852
Got that new sandwich
from Sony in my backpack.

22
00:03:59,897 --> 00:04:01,159
Wi-Fi... mmm!

23
00:04:02,399 --> 00:04:05,197
Yo! You got to forget
about her, dawg.

24
00:04:05,235 --> 00:04:07,226
Look look.
Let me show you something.

25
00:04:07,271 --> 00:04:09,865
She not even
looking at you.

26
00:04:09,907 --> 00:04:11,772
If I could just
tell her how I feel.

27
00:04:11,809 --> 00:04:13,834
Look, Rick, I already told you...

28
00:04:13,877 --> 00:04:15,572
you never gonna get
with Jill, all right?

29
00:04:15,612 --> 00:04:17,307
Seriously, she hangs out
with the popular crew,

30
00:04:17,347 --> 00:04:19,781
and nobody messes around
outside their group, man.

31
00:04:19,817 --> 00:04:22,149
Come on, that crew stuff
isn't real.

32
00:04:22,186 --> 00:04:24,211
The hell it ain't.
Look around, Rick.

33
00:04:24,254 --> 00:04:26,119
- Look, you got your jocks...
- Get the ball, man.

34
00:04:26,156 --> 00:04:28,647
...nerds, emos,

35
00:04:28,692 --> 00:04:30,956
Frodos,

36
00:04:30,994 --> 00:04:33,428
the Scarface society...

37
00:04:33,464 --> 00:04:36,160
...the sexual predators.
- Yeah.

38
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,760
- Of course you got the Rick punchers.
- The who?

39
00:04:38,802 --> 00:04:41,600
- Oh!
- Yeah, they new.

40
00:04:41,638 --> 00:04:43,401
Mm-hmm. But you know what?
Who cares?

41
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,408
'Cause we got our own crew...
me and you.

42
00:04:45,442 --> 00:04:47,273
Thanks, Trey.
You're the best, man.

43
00:04:48,545 --> 00:04:50,103
- Am I in?
- No.

44
00:04:50,147 --> 00:04:52,206
Come on.
Hey, it's me and you, baby.

45
00:04:52,249 --> 00:04:53,876
The two of us against the world.
You hear me?

46
00:04:53,917 --> 00:04:55,350
You look good today.
I like your hair.

47
00:04:55,385 --> 00:04:57,012
I'm gonna show you
something nasty I downloaded.

48
00:04:57,054 --> 00:04:58,681
Don't tell nobody.

49
00:05:00,524 --> 00:05:02,151
Welcome to Amalgamated.

50
00:05:02,192 --> 00:05:04,183
I'm Dr. Strom,
head of the research department...

51
00:05:04,228 --> 00:05:07,197
- Come on, man.
...where we create the future today.

52
00:05:07,231 --> 00:05:10,598
And now I'd like
to show you our crown jewel.

53
00:05:10,634 --> 00:05:13,694
The Amalgamated
animal genetics lab.

54
00:05:13,737 --> 00:05:15,967
Whoa.

55
00:05:16,006 --> 00:05:18,304
Go ahead, explore.

56
00:05:18,342 --> 00:05:20,105
Yo yo. Come on, Rick.
Man, check this out.

57
00:05:20,144 --> 00:05:23,511
All of our animals are
genetically engineered

58
00:05:23,547 --> 00:05:26,107
and each of them has...

59
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:28,118
Oh, you're so pretty.

60
00:05:28,152 --> 00:05:30,985
Hi, birdie.

61
00:05:31,021 --> 00:05:33,387
Hi. Hi.

62
00:05:34,725 --> 00:05:38,559
- She's beautiful, isn't she?
- Yes, she is.

63
00:05:40,197 --> 00:05:42,290
Uh, I'm gonna take
a picture of her

64
00:05:42,332 --> 00:05:44,027
for the school newspaper.

65
00:05:44,067 --> 00:05:46,194
Our only rules: Don't feed the animals

66
00:05:46,236 --> 00:05:49,034
and please,
no flash photography.

67
00:05:50,574 --> 00:05:52,701
Some of our genetically-
engineered animals

68
00:05:52,743 --> 00:05:54,711
are a little sensitive
to light.

69
00:05:57,548 --> 00:05:59,106
It flew away.

70
00:06:04,354 --> 00:06:06,686
Uh... whoo-hoo.

71
00:06:07,691 --> 00:06:09,716
What the F, loser?

72
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,456
Get him, Lance.
- Come on, Lance.

73
00:06:12,496 --> 00:06:15,761
- Leave him alone.
- I don't think so.

74
00:06:15,799 --> 00:06:18,597
Is there
a problem, Lance?

75
00:06:18,635 --> 00:06:22,366
No. No problem,
Uncle Lou.

76
00:06:22,406 --> 00:06:24,499
Mr. Landers!

77
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:27,066
Students,
this is Lou Landers,

78
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:30,238
visionary scientist
and C.E.O. of Amalgamated.

79
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,010
Well, I'm just
a businessman now.

80
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:35,314
The future of science

81
00:06:35,352 --> 00:06:37,445
belongs to all of you.

82
00:06:37,487 --> 00:06:40,456
Please, enjoy the tour.

83
00:06:48,398 --> 00:06:50,366
Are you okay?

84
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,494
Yes, this is
healthy-cough blood.

85
00:06:55,105 --> 00:06:59,371
Rick Riker. You're not Blaine and Julia
Riker's son, are you?

86
00:06:59,409 --> 00:07:02,401
- I am.
- Ah. Good people.

87
00:07:02,446 --> 00:07:05,711
- How are they?
- They died violently nine years ago.

88
00:07:05,749 --> 00:07:07,580
But otherwise okay?

89
00:07:07,618 --> 00:07:11,418
Yes, thank you.
I live with my aunt and uncle now.

90
00:07:11,455 --> 00:07:14,288
Well, you seem
like a real chip off the old block.

91
00:07:14,324 --> 00:07:16,622
Let's hope you're not
violently murdered too.

92
00:07:22,966 --> 00:07:25,799
That's for making me look stupid.

93
00:07:25,836 --> 00:07:28,134
Next time
I hurt you.

94
00:07:28,171 --> 00:07:31,106
Yeah.
You the man, Lance.

95
00:07:34,711 --> 00:07:36,736
Our work with these animals
has helped us develop

96
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:39,977
new antibiotics,
advanced pesticides

97
00:07:40,017 --> 00:07:43,851
and a powerful new pheromone
which drives animals to mate

98
00:07:43,887 --> 00:07:46,287
called compound H2O0.

99
00:07:46,323 --> 00:07:48,883
It's a strong
sexual attractant.

100
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:51,861
A single drop is enough
to arouse any animal.

101
00:07:51,895 --> 00:07:55,626
We plan on using it to breed
endangered species.

102
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:59,397
A special and indeed
often overlooked...

103
00:07:59,436 --> 00:08:02,405
Our most-promising research

104
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:04,634
is with these dragonflies.

105
00:08:04,675 --> 00:08:07,109
For example,
this dragonfly's skin

106
00:08:07,144 --> 00:08:09,510
has a hard,
armor-like exoskeleton

107
00:08:09,546 --> 00:08:10,979
to defend against...

108
00:08:11,014 --> 00:08:12,743
And this species
of dragonfly

109
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:15,013
has enormous strength
for its size.

110
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,678
It can lift vast amounts.

111
00:08:18,722 --> 00:08:20,986
More than it's body weight.

112
00:08:21,024 --> 00:08:24,585
And here we've injected the DNA
from all three species

113
00:08:24,628 --> 00:08:27,062
into seven
new genetically-enhanced

114
00:08:27,097 --> 00:08:28,928
super dragonflies.

115
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:31,833
But there's
only six in there.

116
00:08:31,868 --> 00:08:35,326
Well, one missing dragonfly
is the least of my concerns.

117
00:08:35,372 --> 00:08:37,670
I lost six tigers alone
last month.

118
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:42,044
Ah!

119
00:08:42,079 --> 00:08:45,412
This area is where
we keep our livestock.

120
00:08:50,454 --> 00:08:52,445
Ohh.

121
00:08:54,057 --> 00:08:56,184
Aren't you going
to do something?

122
00:08:56,226 --> 00:08:57,887
Soon as I get
this up on YouTube.

123
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:09,562
I see. Ye... well,
yes, I understand.

124
00:09:09,606 --> 00:09:11,836
Thank you
for the call.

125
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:14,366
That was
the principal.

126
00:09:14,411 --> 00:09:16,709
Rick walked off
a class trip.

127
00:09:16,747 --> 00:09:19,773
After all the parenting
you've done,

128
00:09:19,816 --> 00:09:21,784
he's still so troubled.

129
00:09:21,818 --> 00:09:23,979
Why do you think
that is, Albert?

130
00:09:25,355 --> 00:09:27,084
I have no idea,
Lucille.

131
00:09:27,124 --> 00:09:29,752
I have taught him everything I know
about being a man.

132
00:09:29,793 --> 00:09:32,091
And a good man you are

133
00:09:32,129 --> 00:09:34,359
after all these years
of marriage.

134
00:09:34,398 --> 00:09:35,956
It's like we first met.

135
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:38,365
Sure, you're
a little older.

136
00:09:38,402 --> 00:09:40,097
Your hair's grey.

137
00:09:40,137 --> 00:09:41,536
You have crow's feet.

138
00:09:41,571 --> 00:09:44,131
It takes you
an hour to pee.

139
00:09:44,174 --> 00:09:46,404
Your thighs look
like cottage cheese

140
00:09:46,443 --> 00:09:48,411
someone threw up
on a hot sidewalk.

141
00:09:48,445 --> 00:09:52,142
And you've always had
a tiny penis.

142
00:09:53,517 --> 00:09:56,975
Well... what does it matter
when you're in love?

143
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:02,322
Oh, Rick.

144
00:10:02,359 --> 00:10:04,793
We were wondering
where you were.

145
00:10:04,828 --> 00:10:07,023
It's so late.

146
00:10:08,632 --> 00:10:11,829
About time you got home.
Your aunt was getting worried.

147
00:10:11,868 --> 00:10:14,098
You can sleep late
in the morning,

148
00:10:14,137 --> 00:10:17,038
but don't forget
to feed the fish.

149
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:20,570
Attaboy.

150
00:10:22,612 --> 00:10:24,580
I don't know.

151
00:10:24,614 --> 00:10:26,741
Something just doesn't seem
quite right with him today.

152
00:10:26,783 --> 00:10:29,547
Teenagers.
I'll talk to him.

153
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:37,426
Rough day, huh?
Well, I won't lie to you.

154
00:10:37,461 --> 00:10:39,429
Puberty is
a difficult time

155
00:10:39,463 --> 00:10:41,454
in a young man's life.

156
00:10:41,498 --> 00:10:44,661
Now this book may explain
what's happening.

157
00:10:44,701 --> 00:10:48,330
Let's see.
There are mood swings, fluid retention,

158
00:10:48,371 --> 00:10:51,568
and once a month you'll bleed
from your vagina.

159
00:10:52,576 --> 00:10:54,874
This may be
the wrong book.

160
00:10:54,911 --> 00:10:57,778
What's important is that you're on
the verge of adulthood.

161
00:10:57,814 --> 00:11:00,874
Here...
take a drink.

162
00:11:00,917 --> 00:11:03,545
Ah, the rituals
of manhood.

163
00:11:03,587 --> 00:11:05,316
Today you have
your first beer,

164
00:11:05,355 --> 00:11:07,323
and tomorrow
we'll circumcise you.

165
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,169
I'm losing patience,
Dr. Strom.

166
00:11:20,203 --> 00:11:22,364
Please, sir, if you could just
wait a few minutes...

167
00:11:22,405 --> 00:11:24,168
I've waited long enough
for this egomaniac.

168
00:11:24,207 --> 00:11:26,175
We're the board of directors.
Our time is valuable.

169
00:11:26,209 --> 00:11:28,268
Not as valuable
as mine, Mr. Carlson.

170
00:11:28,311 --> 00:11:32,042
You see, I have
a terminal illness.

171
00:11:32,082 --> 00:11:34,277
I've been
fighting it for years,

172
00:11:34,317 --> 00:11:37,218
but the disease has
ravaged my organs.

173
00:11:37,254 --> 00:11:40,883
As of this moment,
I have one hour left to live.

174
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,925
It was on sale.

175
00:11:47,697 --> 00:11:49,858
Gentlemen, if you're ready,

176
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:52,494
allow me
to show you the future.

177
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:55,533
Strom.

178
00:12:00,744 --> 00:12:03,577
From the... lift it ov...
lift it over!

179
00:12:07,384 --> 00:12:09,784
What the hell
is that?

180
00:12:09,819 --> 00:12:12,151
An innovation...
thank you...

181
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:14,180
that will not only
save my life

182
00:12:14,224 --> 00:12:16,215
but the life
of this company.

183
00:12:16,259 --> 00:12:19,888
For too long we've scraped out profits
from pills and injections.

184
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:22,694
The real prize is
the total cure.

185
00:12:22,732 --> 00:12:25,565
A device
that can alter DNA

186
00:12:25,602 --> 00:12:27,570
and restore the body
to perfect health.

187
00:12:27,604 --> 00:12:29,902
- You're crazy.
- No.

188
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:33,637
Crazy is hearing voices,
talking to cats,

189
00:12:33,677 --> 00:12:35,542
dating Paula Abdul.

190
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:38,639
I'm not crazy.
I'm a visionary!

191
00:12:38,682 --> 00:12:40,650
Sir.
Sir, the machine's

192
00:12:40,684 --> 00:12:43,118
never been fully tested.
If something should go wrong...

193
00:12:43,153 --> 00:12:45,485
- Start the machine!
- Yes, sir.

194
00:12:51,595 --> 00:12:53,654
Plasma level
is steady.

195
00:12:53,697 --> 00:12:55,961
Genetic modification's
at optimum levels!

196
00:12:55,999 --> 00:12:58,763
Sir, the core is overheating.

197
00:12:58,802 --> 00:13:01,600
- Ah!
- We have to abort!

198
00:13:07,677 --> 00:13:10,805
Did it work?

199
00:13:10,847 --> 00:13:13,839
I'm so sorry.

200
00:13:13,883 --> 00:13:16,181
Well, well, well.

201
00:13:16,219 --> 00:13:18,449
I want you to know
what a joy it will be

202
00:13:18,488 --> 00:13:21,150
running this company
without you in the way.

203
00:13:22,993 --> 00:13:25,791
Let go.
Let me go.

204
00:13:48,818 --> 00:13:53,016
Gentlemen, I think it's time we made
some personnel changes.

205
00:13:54,491 --> 00:13:56,618
No, stay away!

206
00:14:11,274 --> 00:14:14,710
Oh. How long
was I asleep?

207
00:14:14,744 --> 00:14:18,373
Five days.

208
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:33,720
Huh.

209
00:15:29,586 --> 00:15:31,315
Wait.
Wha...

210
00:15:40,597 --> 00:15:42,189
Oh, Dad.

211
00:15:47,971 --> 00:15:50,599
I thought
you'd live forever.

212
00:16:07,557 --> 00:16:08,854
Oh.

213
00:16:48,097 --> 00:16:50,156
Breakfast, Rick!

214
00:16:51,434 --> 00:16:53,334
I'll be right down!

215
00:16:56,372 --> 00:16:57,999
Oh!

216
00:17:06,883 --> 00:17:09,010
If I can have your attention.

217
00:17:09,052 --> 00:17:12,715
We are delighted to have
as guest judge

218
00:17:12,755 --> 00:17:15,087
the foremost scientist
in the world.

219
00:17:15,124 --> 00:17:18,560
He's a visiting professor
at Empire City University

220
00:17:18,595 --> 00:17:21,359
where he's working
with the rare element cerillium.

221
00:17:21,397 --> 00:17:25,026
I am so proud to welcome
Dr. Stephen Hawking.

222
00:17:31,641 --> 00:17:34,371
Thank you for that warm welcome.

223
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:37,004
I have a disease
that has paralyzed me.

224
00:17:37,046 --> 00:17:41,278
I cannot walk and I use
this computer to speak.

225
00:17:41,317 --> 00:17:46,016
But I am not depressed,
because I have the gift of knowledge.

226
00:17:46,055 --> 00:17:50,321
That's a lie.
I think about suicide every day.

227
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,659
But you should all be happy
with your lives.

228
00:17:53,696 --> 00:17:56,790
You can walk, talk,
wipe your own asses

229
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:58,698
and then there's
all the sex.

230
00:17:58,735 --> 00:18:01,727
I haven't had sex in years.

231
00:18:01,771 --> 00:18:05,400
My nurse is a lesbian,
and not the hot kind.

232
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:09,205
Hey, anyone want
to get high?

233
00:18:09,245 --> 00:18:11,941
- I've got some hash with me.
- No way.

234
00:18:11,981 --> 00:18:14,541
White guy
in the dreads,

235
00:18:14,584 --> 00:18:16,677
you know
what I'm talking about.

236
00:18:16,719 --> 00:18:18,584
Can I get a what what?

237
00:18:18,621 --> 00:18:19,952
Holla.

238
00:18:19,989 --> 00:18:22,958
I've got a stiff pole
for your sweet hole.

239
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:26,618
Anyone? Anyone?

240
00:18:26,663 --> 00:18:28,255
Pussies.

241
00:18:28,298 --> 00:18:30,789
Dr. Hawking,
I am such a fan.

242
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:33,802
I'd love to show you
my project on supernovas.

243
00:18:35,104 --> 00:18:37,299
You have an incredible ass...

244
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:40,207
...stromony career
ahead of you.

245
00:18:54,057 --> 00:18:56,025
Wait, where's Saturn?

246
00:18:56,059 --> 00:18:57,617
I'd hate to lose
my father's bowling ball.

247
00:18:59,395 --> 00:19:01,124
There it is.

248
00:19:01,164 --> 00:19:03,496
Great reflexes.

249
00:19:06,669 --> 00:19:08,637
You have
very manly hands.

250
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:10,866
So do you.

251
00:19:10,907 --> 00:19:14,365
I'm gonna go find a spot
for my project.

252
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:16,139
Yeah, okay.

253
00:19:35,999 --> 00:19:38,263
Watch where you're going
in slo-mo, dipshit.

254
00:19:38,301 --> 00:19:40,064
- Pfft.
- Yeah.

255
00:19:42,538 --> 00:19:44,301
Go to her, stupid.

256
00:19:45,575 --> 00:19:47,509
Tell her how you feel.

257
00:20:06,929 --> 00:20:08,123
Yow.

258
00:20:10,066 --> 00:20:11,431
Any day.

259
00:20:11,467 --> 00:20:13,298
Uh... he did it.

260
00:20:16,239 --> 00:20:17,604
Ow!

261
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:20,131
- I'm gonna kill you.
- Get him, Lance!

262
00:20:20,176 --> 00:20:22,406
- Lance, stop it.
- Kick his ass, Lance!

263
00:20:22,445 --> 00:20:24,936
Fight fight fight!

264
00:20:24,981 --> 00:20:27,211
- Let's see what you got.
- Fucking break him!

265
00:20:28,284 --> 00:20:30,946
Whoa!

266
00:20:30,987 --> 00:20:32,784
Oh!

267
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:35,851
Damn!

268
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,321
Ooh!

269
00:20:49,405 --> 00:20:51,339
Get off!

270
00:20:51,374 --> 00:20:53,672
Get... get off me!

271
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,405
Yah!

272
00:20:58,147 --> 00:21:01,378
Ow. Ow. Ow.

273
00:21:05,922 --> 00:21:08,550
Shit shit shit shit.

274
00:21:40,523 --> 00:21:42,753
# Oh no, you didn't, didn't #

275
00:21:42,792 --> 00:21:44,589
- # Oh no, you didn't #
- # Oh yes, we did #

276
00:21:44,627 --> 00:21:47,095
# Oh no, you didn't, didn't,
Oh no, you didn't #

277
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:49,530
- # Oh yeah, we did #
- # Oh no, you didn't, didn't #

278
00:21:49,565 --> 00:21:51,396
- # Oh no, you didn't #
- # Oh yes, we did. #

279
00:21:56,739 --> 00:21:58,400
Stop! Stop! Hey!

280
00:22:02,445 --> 00:22:04,470
Get out of the way!
No brakes!

281
00:22:08,217 --> 00:22:09,946
Get out of the way!

282
00:22:09,986 --> 00:22:11,886
Ma'am, look out!

283
00:22:16,926 --> 00:22:18,917
Are you okay?

284
00:22:30,773 --> 00:22:33,264
- How did you...
- I can't believe it.

285
00:22:33,309 --> 00:22:35,607
- You just saved that old lady's life.
- Amazing.

286
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:38,808
l... I guess.
If I hadn't pushed her out of the way,

287
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:40,372
she would've die... ah!

288
00:22:51,127 --> 00:22:53,288
You should be really proud of yourself.

289
00:22:53,329 --> 00:22:55,490
You're some kind of hero.

290
00:22:55,531 --> 00:22:56,964
If you could excuse me.

291
00:23:00,937 --> 00:23:04,236
There we go. Awfully nice of you
to help me out here, Trey.

292
00:23:04,273 --> 00:23:07,174
Oh, no problem.
I'm waiting on Rick, anyway, so...

293
00:23:08,277 --> 00:23:10,245
Ooh.

294
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:12,304
My God.

295
00:23:12,348 --> 00:23:14,373
How did you do that?

296
00:23:14,417 --> 00:23:17,614
Uh, it's easier
than it looks.

297
00:23:22,158 --> 00:23:24,183
No, I don't think so.

298
00:23:24,227 --> 00:23:26,661
Why don't you tell me
what's going on?

299
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:29,995
All right. Well,
there is something, okay?

300
00:23:30,032 --> 00:23:32,500
But you have to
keep it a secret.

301
00:23:35,037 --> 00:23:38,438
I think I have...
superpowers.

302
00:23:38,474 --> 00:23:40,533
I find that
hard to believe.

303
00:23:40,576 --> 00:23:42,271
All right, all right,
how about this?

304
00:23:42,311 --> 00:23:43,903
Go ahead and throw
as many punches as you want.

305
00:23:43,946 --> 00:23:46,380
I bet you 100 bucks
you don't land one.

306
00:23:48,751 --> 00:23:51,151
Easy money.

307
00:23:51,187 --> 00:23:53,621
What else can you do?

308
00:23:53,656 --> 00:23:55,954
I don't know.
l... I was bitten by a dragonfly.

309
00:23:55,992 --> 00:23:59,621
Well, some dragonflies
have armored skin.

310
00:23:59,662 --> 00:24:02,256
I wonder if my skin is...

311
00:24:03,766 --> 00:24:06,326
Well, good thing
that worked.

312
00:24:07,336 --> 00:24:08,997
So you do have
superpowers.

313
00:24:09,038 --> 00:24:11,233
We could be a team!

314
00:24:11,274 --> 00:24:13,708
We gonna
get fame, money...

315
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:16,974
- Don't forget the bitches.
- There's not gonna be fame

316
00:24:17,013 --> 00:24:19,208
and there's not
gonna be bitches, okay?

317
00:24:19,248 --> 00:24:22,479
I didn't ask for any of this.
I just wanna be like everybody else.

318
00:24:22,518 --> 00:24:24,611
That isn't what
your parents wanted for you.

319
00:24:25,788 --> 00:24:27,722
You're not my father.

320
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:29,588
But I love you
like your father did.

321
00:24:29,625 --> 00:24:31,525
I believe in you
like your father did.

322
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,825
I had sex with your mother just
like your father did.

323
00:24:34,864 --> 00:24:37,890
Huh. You'll never
understand me.

324
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:41,370
Never.

325
00:24:53,149 --> 00:24:55,777
That isn't what
your parents wanted for you.

326
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:02,622
What a great performance.

327
00:25:02,658 --> 00:25:04,421
Well, Rick,
did you enjoy the opera?

328
00:25:10,533 --> 00:25:13,502
Son, is something
troubling you?

329
00:25:13,536 --> 00:25:15,936
It's so unfair.
They have nothing.

330
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:18,839
Why do we have $2 billion?

331
00:25:18,874 --> 00:25:21,001
Well, your grandfather
left us $3 billion

332
00:25:21,043 --> 00:25:22,374
and I made some
bad investments.

333
00:25:22,411 --> 00:25:24,436
But that's nothing for you
to worry about.

334
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,675
But I want
to change things.

335
00:25:26,716 --> 00:25:29,207
And you will.
Five generations of Rikers

336
00:25:29,251 --> 00:25:31,481
have worked hard to make
this city great.

337
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,353
One day, Rick, people will look
to you to be a hero.

338
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:37,154
When that day comes,
will you be ready?

339
00:25:37,193 --> 00:25:38,660
Give me your wallet.

340
00:25:38,694 --> 00:25:40,685
That too.

341
00:25:43,432 --> 00:25:45,866
People will look to you to be a hero.

342
00:25:45,901 --> 00:25:48,893
When that day comes,
will you be ready?

343
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:52,037
Rick!

344
00:25:56,612 --> 00:25:57,601
Ah!

345
00:26:00,216 --> 00:26:01,308
Ow!

346
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,717
Huh? Ah!

347
00:26:05,755 --> 00:26:07,655
Rick, please!

348
00:26:08,891 --> 00:26:10,051
Ah!

349
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:21,734
- Dad!
- Oh, Rick, I'm dying.

350
00:26:21,771 --> 00:26:23,398
- No!
- Don't worry.

351
00:26:23,439 --> 00:26:24,963
My brother Albert
will take you in.

352
00:26:25,007 --> 00:26:28,443
Rick, the money,
it's all yours now.

353
00:26:28,477 --> 00:26:31,708
Sell all shares of a small company
called Google.

354
00:26:31,747 --> 00:26:35,740
It's worthless.
Invest heavily in Enron.

355
00:26:35,785 --> 00:26:38,754
Rick, I have
something for you.

356
00:26:38,788 --> 00:26:41,780
Reach into
my coat pocket.

357
00:26:41,824 --> 00:26:44,918
The other coat pocket.

358
00:26:47,363 --> 00:26:48,489
God!

359
00:26:50,299 --> 00:26:52,267
That ring
was my father's

360
00:26:52,301 --> 00:26:54,565
and his father's
before him.

361
00:26:54,603 --> 00:26:57,128
Earn it, Rick.
Be a hero.

362
00:26:57,173 --> 00:26:59,141
Claim your...

363
00:27:02,645 --> 00:27:04,636
- destiny.

364
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,204
Dad!

365
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:12,952
I'm no superhero.

366
00:27:12,988 --> 00:27:15,650
I'm nobody!

367
00:27:15,691 --> 00:27:17,181
Ah!

368
00:27:17,226 --> 00:27:19,888
Shut up back there! I'm gonna kill you!

369
00:27:33,676 --> 00:27:36,645
- Are you okay?
- What, you heard that?

370
00:27:36,679 --> 00:27:39,944
You're nothing but an ugly,
ungrateful little whore!

371
00:27:39,982 --> 00:27:42,177
Just like your mother!

372
00:27:42,218 --> 00:27:44,618
- Who was that?
- My mother.

373
00:27:44,653 --> 00:27:47,850
Listen, about what happened
at school this morning, l...

374
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:49,152
You really freaked us out.

375
00:27:49,191 --> 00:27:51,159
I'm really going through
a tough time right now.

376
00:27:51,193 --> 00:27:54,458
Me too. My parents,
they want me to go to college,

377
00:27:54,497 --> 00:27:57,193
but I want
to be a dancer.

378
00:27:57,233 --> 00:27:58,825
I believe in you.

379
00:27:58,868 --> 00:28:01,530
You really do,
don't you?

380
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:04,164
I wish I could say
the same for Lance.

381
00:28:04,206 --> 00:28:05,969
I don't know.
Is he the right one

382
00:28:06,008 --> 00:28:08,670
or am I just dating him
to rebel against my father?

383
00:28:08,711 --> 00:28:11,077
He doesn't want any boy near me.

384
00:28:11,113 --> 00:28:13,445
That's why he installed
the electrified fence.

385
00:28:13,482 --> 00:28:16,679
Well, we'll see.
You can't run from your destiny.

386
00:28:16,719 --> 00:28:18,744
- Right?
- Right.

387
00:28:19,889 --> 00:28:23,620
- Jill, let's go!
- Nice car.

388
00:28:23,659 --> 00:28:27,390
Maybe one day you could take me
for a ride in your car.

389
00:28:28,864 --> 00:28:30,354
Uh...

390
00:28:32,568 --> 00:28:34,695
Uh, yeah.

391
00:28:34,737 --> 00:28:36,637
Yeah, definitely.

392
00:28:42,978 --> 00:28:46,744
Oh. Lovebirds.

393
00:29:13,108 --> 00:29:15,576
Rick, this is
Professor Xavier.

394
00:29:15,611 --> 00:29:19,274
Your powers are growing,
but you can't control it.

395
00:29:19,315 --> 00:29:21,943
It's important that you...

396
00:29:21,984 --> 00:29:25,647
become a hero...
train yourself to fly...

397
00:29:27,189 --> 00:29:29,419
...in your ass because...

398
00:29:29,458 --> 00:29:31,983
...squatting
on a glass table...

399
00:29:32,027 --> 00:29:35,485
...two girls...
one cup...

400
00:29:35,531 --> 00:29:37,863
You know what to do.

401
00:29:48,844 --> 00:29:52,575
- This shouldn't take long.
- Well, I'll be waiting right here.

402
00:29:52,615 --> 00:29:54,139
Hello, Mr. Bailey.

403
00:29:54,183 --> 00:29:56,276
I've reviewed your request
for a loan, Mr. Riker,

404
00:29:56,318 --> 00:29:58,752
but with no job,
no credit history,

405
00:29:58,787 --> 00:30:00,982
I'm afraid
I have to say no.

406
00:30:01,023 --> 00:30:02,490
But what about this?

407
00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:05,686
That was last month.

408
00:30:06,762 --> 00:30:08,821
This new promotion's
proving quite popular.

409
00:30:08,864 --> 00:30:10,764
Look, I need
to buy a car.

410
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:13,825
Frankly, Mr. Riker, you're the worst
applicant we've ever had.

411
00:30:13,869 --> 00:30:16,633
Thanks for the loan, Mr. Thompson.

412
00:30:18,007 --> 00:30:22,273
This is a good boy.
There must be something I could do.

413
00:30:22,311 --> 00:30:23,903
Ma'am...

414
00:30:23,946 --> 00:30:27,040
rubbing my crotch under the desk
won't change my mind.

415
00:30:27,082 --> 00:30:28,982
I'm not rubbing
your crotch.

416
00:30:30,352 --> 00:30:32,286
I really need that car.

417
00:30:32,321 --> 00:30:34,186
I don't see
how that's my problem.

418
00:30:34,223 --> 00:30:36,350
This is a robbery! Nobody move!

419
00:30:36,392 --> 00:30:38,690
Everybody stay down!
Stay down!

420
00:30:38,727 --> 00:30:40,194
- Get down.
- Come on, Lady! Hurry it up!

421
00:30:40,229 --> 00:30:43,062
- Oh.
- Come on, move it!

422
00:30:46,735 --> 00:30:49,636
Oh, hey, I made the same mistake
before when I came in.

423
00:30:49,672 --> 00:30:51,162
Thanks.

424
00:30:52,675 --> 00:30:55,735
You idiot! You let him get away
with our money!

425
00:30:55,778 --> 00:30:58,713
I don't see
how that's my problem.

426
00:31:01,617 --> 00:31:05,212
- Oh, man!
- Wow.

427
00:31:05,254 --> 00:31:07,745
Come over here!
You've got to see this.

428
00:31:08,757 --> 00:31:10,850
Let me through.
Let me through.

429
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:18,793
Oh, thank God. I thought something
terrible had happened.

430
00:31:18,834 --> 00:31:21,530
Well, an old guy did
get shot over there.

431
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:28,572
Uncle Albert! Just try to breathe.

432
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:32,307
I can't.
You're kneeling on my balls.

433
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:33,906
Oh, sorry.

434
00:31:33,949 --> 00:31:36,349
Rick, listen.

435
00:31:36,385 --> 00:31:39,912
With great power comes...

436
00:31:39,955 --> 00:31:41,422
Great responsibility?

437
00:31:41,457 --> 00:31:43,550
I was gonna stick
with bitches,

438
00:31:43,592 --> 00:31:45,560
but if you want to be a virgin
for the rest of your life...

439
00:31:45,594 --> 00:31:47,221
Uncle Albert!

440
00:31:47,262 --> 00:31:49,389
My balls!

441
00:31:56,939 --> 00:31:58,406
Very good.

442
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:10,045
Oh, God.
Mr. Landers!

443
00:32:24,733 --> 00:32:25,961
Oh no.

444
00:32:27,202 --> 00:32:29,830
Okay.

445
00:32:29,872 --> 00:32:32,397
Hide the body.
Hide the body. Yeah.

446
00:32:39,615 --> 00:32:42,379
Get in!
Yah! Yah!

447
00:32:49,158 --> 00:32:52,457
Okay, I come back.

448
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:10,110
Jill?

449
00:33:10,145 --> 00:33:12,807
I came as soon
as I heard.

450
00:33:12,848 --> 00:33:16,045
- Where's Aunt Lucille?
- She's at home under heavy sedation.

451
00:33:16,084 --> 00:33:18,644
They made her watch three hours
of women's basketball.

452
00:33:18,687 --> 00:33:21,952
- This is all my fault.
- Rick, it was an armed robbery.

453
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:23,617
There was nothing
you could've done.

454
00:33:23,659 --> 00:33:25,991
I could've stopped that guy
before he shot my uncle.

455
00:33:26,028 --> 00:33:28,189
Then there is blood
on your hands.

456
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:31,688
But that's not important. All that matters
is that you're here for him now.

457
00:33:31,733 --> 00:33:34,133
- Rick Riker?
- Yes?

458
00:33:34,169 --> 00:33:36,729
Dr. Whitby.
I've run some tests.

459
00:33:36,772 --> 00:33:39,036
I'm afraid I have bad news.

460
00:33:39,074 --> 00:33:41,975
What is it?

461
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:43,841
I have an impacted colon.

462
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:47,814
Whew.
What a night.

463
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:50,580
Now what brought you
here today?

464
00:33:50,619 --> 00:33:53,179
- My uncle.
- Your uncle brought you?

465
00:33:53,222 --> 00:33:56,350
- No, he's gravely injured.
- Well, then he shouldn't be driving.

466
00:33:56,391 --> 00:33:59,383
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have to perform a breast exam.

467
00:33:59,428 --> 00:34:01,692
Doctor, please.
Is my uncle gonna survive?

468
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:04,756
Well, I don't know.
We should probably have a look.

469
00:34:05,901 --> 00:34:08,529
Hard to say.

470
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:11,505
Yup, pretty deep coma.

471
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:13,167
Is he gonna be okay?

472
00:34:13,208 --> 00:34:15,972
Well, I'm not a betting man,
but if you want to put some money on it,

473
00:34:16,011 --> 00:34:18,502
- I'll take "dead in a week."
- Oh my God!

474
00:34:18,547 --> 00:34:20,845
No, it's all right.
It's a normal emotional reaction,

475
00:34:20,883 --> 00:34:23,010
but this should take
the edge off of it.

476
00:34:23,051 --> 00:34:25,212
Here we go.
Nice and easy.

477
00:34:25,254 --> 00:34:29,190
- That's your vein.
- Yes, I know.

478
00:34:29,224 --> 00:34:31,385
First my parents and now this?

479
00:34:32,394 --> 00:34:33,986
I'm nothing
but a screw-up.

480
00:34:34,029 --> 00:34:36,520
Yes, your life has been
a testament to that.

481
00:34:36,565 --> 00:34:39,329
But your uncle believed
in you and so do I.

482
00:34:39,368 --> 00:34:42,667
It's never too late to become the person
you're meant to be.

483
00:34:48,844 --> 00:34:49,044
Rick.

484
00:34:49,044 --> 00:34:50,602
Rick.

485
00:34:52,147 --> 00:34:54,206
Rick.

486
00:34:57,819 --> 00:34:58,877
Hello, Rick.

487
00:34:58,921 --> 00:35:01,412
Who are you and how
do you know my name?

488
00:35:01,456 --> 00:35:03,720
- I'm a psychic.
- Prove it.

489
00:35:03,759 --> 00:35:07,593
Think of any number
between one and a million

490
00:35:07,629 --> 00:35:09,392
and I'll tell you
what it is.

491
00:35:10,432 --> 00:35:12,332
- Nine.
- Not out loud, dumbass!

492
00:35:12,367 --> 00:35:14,927
Follow me...

493
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:16,938
you dumb son of a bitch.

494
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:20,108
My name is
Professor Xavier,

495
00:35:20,142 --> 00:35:22,076
and this is my school.

496
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:23,805
I started it
to help people

497
00:35:23,845 --> 00:35:27,110
with special talents
like yours.

498
00:35:27,149 --> 00:35:30,084
Our students here learn to harness
their incredible talents.

499
00:35:30,118 --> 00:35:33,110
and use them to advance
the common good.

500
00:35:35,991 --> 00:35:37,686
Ah! Ow.

501
00:35:37,726 --> 00:35:41,127
Here we have children
who can walk through walls.

502
00:35:41,163 --> 00:35:43,757
We have children who think they can
walk through walls.

503
00:35:43,799 --> 00:35:47,030
Some faces may be familiar,

504
00:35:47,069 --> 00:35:49,799
like Wolverine.

505
00:35:49,838 --> 00:35:52,363
Other mutants you probably
didn't know existed,

506
00:35:52,407 --> 00:35:54,932
like Sneezo.

507
00:35:54,977 --> 00:35:57,844
Most of our students
are born with their powers.

508
00:35:57,879 --> 00:36:01,110
Some, like you,
gain them later in life.

509
00:36:01,149 --> 00:36:03,242
- Oh, is that...
- Yes, it is.

510
00:36:03,285 --> 00:36:05,446
When he came to this school,

511
00:36:05,487 --> 00:36:07,318
he weighed 130 lbs.

512
00:36:07,356 --> 00:36:09,688
Take enough roids,
you could do anything.

513
00:36:10,993 --> 00:36:13,427
Back up off those pills, Barry!

514
00:36:18,567 --> 00:36:21,695
- Why have you brought me here?
- Because you have the potential

515
00:36:21,737 --> 00:36:24,638
- to be the best.
- But I can't even fly.

516
00:36:24,673 --> 00:36:27,301
Once you understand
the true nature of heroism,

517
00:36:27,342 --> 00:36:30,277
you will fly.
But first I must teach you

518
00:36:30,312 --> 00:36:32,507
the secret
to becoming a superhero.

519
00:36:32,547 --> 00:36:35,243
Hey, Storm! You look
like you putting on a little weight.

520
00:36:35,283 --> 00:36:37,945
Ah! Oh!

521
00:36:39,454 --> 00:36:41,581
So, Professor,
about this secret...

522
00:36:41,623 --> 00:36:43,113
- Well, you see...
- Xavier!

523
00:36:43,158 --> 00:36:46,457
- Aw, shit.
- Well?

524
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:48,656
You wanna explain
why I found her hiding in your closet?

525
00:36:48,697 --> 00:36:50,562
But, pumpkin,
I don't see nobody.

526
00:36:50,599 --> 00:36:52,931
- Oh, you don't?
- Ow!

527
00:36:52,968 --> 00:36:54,629
Invisible Girl?

528
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:57,002
Apparently not
invisible enough.

529
00:36:57,039 --> 00:36:59,473
If you knew how to take care of your man,
maybe this wouldn't have happened.

530
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:01,499
- No, she didn't.
- Oh, this bitch is crazy.

531
00:37:01,543 --> 00:37:03,443
I'm gonna have to
whip your ass.

532
00:37:03,478 --> 00:37:05,469
- You don't say no disrespectful...
- What are you gonna do, baldy?

533
00:37:05,514 --> 00:37:07,414
I'm everywhere,
sweet cheeks.

534
00:37:07,449 --> 00:37:09,713
- Whoa!
- Ow!

535
00:37:09,751 --> 00:37:11,844
- That all you got?
- Yeah!

536
00:37:11,887 --> 00:37:15,482
Now what?
Now how about that, Invisi-bitch?

537
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:17,890
Yeah, whatever.
I'm out of here.

538
00:37:17,926 --> 00:37:20,861
I'm sure gonna miss her.
She was crazy in the sack.

539
00:37:20,896 --> 00:37:24,059
Biting, scratching, panting,
tongue all over the place.

540
00:37:24,099 --> 00:37:25,930
Wasn't me, asshole.

541
00:37:25,967 --> 00:37:28,299
Come on, Spanky.

542
00:37:28,336 --> 00:37:30,930
I didn't even know
she had a dog.

543
00:37:30,972 --> 00:37:34,066
Still some of the best
sex I ever had.

544
00:37:34,109 --> 00:37:37,306
How could you do this
to me? To your kids?

545
00:37:37,345 --> 00:37:39,643
To your newborn baby?

546
00:37:39,681 --> 00:37:41,478
How do I know
that baby's even mine?

547
00:37:41,516 --> 00:37:44,076
Because he can do this.

548
00:37:44,119 --> 00:37:45,518
Shit!

549
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:47,579
Ah!

550
00:37:47,622 --> 00:37:49,283
Aw, man.

551
00:37:49,324 --> 00:37:52,225
Now I'm never gonna know the secret
to becoming a superhero.

552
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:55,252
You wanna know the secret?
Come close.

553
00:37:58,233 --> 00:38:00,326
Make a costume,
shithead!

554
00:38:00,368 --> 00:38:03,769
I swear to God. They get dumber
and dumber every year.

555
00:38:04,906 --> 00:38:07,101
A costume.

556
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:41,436
Rick, you, uh...

557
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:44,468
Oh my God.

558
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,277
Damn!

559
00:38:47,315 --> 00:38:50,148
Dude, you're like
a real superhero, man!

560
00:38:50,185 --> 00:38:52,380
I love the mask.

561
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:53,614
How you breathe
in it though?

562
00:38:55,891 --> 00:38:58,086
What's that sound?

563
00:38:58,126 --> 00:39:00,993
You put some kind
of air intake in the mask.

564
00:39:01,029 --> 00:39:02,997
Boy, you better...
now I'm assuming

565
00:39:03,031 --> 00:39:05,727
that the material is
see-through, right?

566
00:39:05,767 --> 00:39:08,099
Yeah, dude, I'ma tell you something.
Rick, this is good.

567
00:39:08,136 --> 00:39:11,367
I'm impressed.
Like really impressed.

568
00:39:22,350 --> 00:39:24,910
Hey, that's my spot.

569
00:39:24,953 --> 00:39:27,421
You're sitting on my gargoyle.
Move it.

570
00:39:27,455 --> 00:39:30,083
- Excuse me?
- What are you even doing here?

571
00:39:30,125 --> 00:39:32,218
I'm looking seriously
out over the city

572
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:35,161
in a squatting position.

573
00:39:35,197 --> 00:39:37,188
Well, that's what I do here.
So if you're not moving,

574
00:39:37,232 --> 00:39:39,427
I guess we're gonna
have to share.

575
00:39:39,467 --> 00:39:40,627
Uh, okay, fine.

576
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:43,229
I actually usually
perch in the front.

577
00:39:43,271 --> 00:39:45,831
Oh, all right.
Well, here, you've got to go around.

578
00:39:45,874 --> 00:39:48,399
- Okay, wait.
- Just turn this way. Here we go.

579
00:39:48,443 --> 00:39:50,411
- Dude!
- You're right, I'm sorry. Relax.

580
00:39:50,445 --> 00:39:52,106
- Okay okay.
- Okay okay.

581
00:39:54,816 --> 00:39:57,410
- Uh, I can't perch like this.
- God, me neither.

582
00:39:57,452 --> 00:39:59,511
- What's your name?
- John Storm.

583
00:39:59,554 --> 00:40:02,022
Dragonfly.
So what's your power?

584
00:40:02,057 --> 00:40:04,423
What's my power?
Stand back.

585
00:40:06,394 --> 00:40:09,420
- Flame on!
- Whoa!

586
00:40:09,464 --> 00:40:11,728
Huh?

587
00:40:11,766 --> 00:40:14,633
I'm on fire!

588
00:40:14,669 --> 00:40:17,069
Get a blanket or something!
Holy shit!

589
00:40:17,105 --> 00:40:20,541
It's not working!
Get the fire extinguisher!

590
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:23,973
Ah! No! Ah!

591
00:40:24,012 --> 00:40:26,276
God! You idiot, stop!

592
00:40:26,314 --> 00:40:28,282
What's wrong with you?

593
00:40:38,193 --> 00:40:40,457
Sorry, my bad.

594
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:49,498
Rick, once you understand
the true nature of heroism,

595
00:40:49,537 --> 00:40:51,505
you will fly.

596
00:40:54,542 --> 00:40:57,340
Shit.

597
00:41:16,197 --> 00:41:20,531
This Dragonfly,
he's not even a hero.

598
00:41:20,568 --> 00:41:23,696
He's not... I have... I have...
I have just a... I have...

599
00:41:25,073 --> 00:41:28,042
He can't...
he can't even fly.

600
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:31,769
The Dragonfly
can't even fly!

601
00:41:35,350 --> 00:41:37,818
I can fly, okay?

602
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:40,754
I can fly.

603
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:42,450
This just in:

604
00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:45,084
Tom Cruise is dead.

605
00:41:45,126 --> 00:41:47,594
World's most powerful man.

606
00:41:48,997 --> 00:41:51,693
I have a feeling you might
disagree with that.

607
00:41:54,569 --> 00:41:57,003
Strom, do you have
my test results?

608
00:41:57,038 --> 00:41:59,506
Yes, sir.

609
00:42:02,277 --> 00:42:06,145
Whatever you're doing
to your... victims,

610
00:42:06,181 --> 00:42:09,309
rejuvenates you.
But only for 24 hours.

611
00:42:09,351 --> 00:42:11,148
Hmmm.

612
00:42:11,186 --> 00:42:14,678
What if I killed 28 people
in one session?

613
00:42:14,723 --> 00:42:16,691
Would that give me
a month to live?

614
00:42:16,725 --> 00:42:19,057
If it were February, yes.

615
00:42:19,094 --> 00:42:20,721
But only if your cells
could absorb

616
00:42:20,762 --> 00:42:23,094
that much energy at once,
and they can't.

617
00:42:23,131 --> 00:42:26,191
I'm afraid
you have to kill each day

618
00:42:26,234 --> 00:42:28,168
to live each day.

619
00:42:28,203 --> 00:42:30,865
Still a slave
to the tyranny of time.

620
00:42:30,905 --> 00:42:33,237
There must be some answer.

621
00:42:33,274 --> 00:42:35,242
There isn't.

622
00:42:35,276 --> 00:42:37,870
Unless...

623
00:42:37,912 --> 00:42:41,348
unless you had
some cerillium.

624
00:42:41,383 --> 00:42:44,011
Then you could create
a device powerful enough

625
00:42:44,052 --> 00:42:46,612
to draw the life-force out
of thousands of people

626
00:42:46,654 --> 00:42:48,918
and enhance your own
cellular capacity.

627
00:42:48,957 --> 00:42:51,391
Strom, you're a genius.

628
00:42:51,426 --> 00:42:54,122
Wikipedia.
But that's not important.

629
00:42:54,162 --> 00:42:57,689
What is important is that you
don't have any cerillium.

630
00:42:57,732 --> 00:42:59,962
Besides, it's immoral.
We don't do that sort of thing.

631
00:43:00,001 --> 00:43:01,593
We're a pharmaceutical
company.

632
00:43:01,636 --> 00:43:03,968
Wait a minute.

633
00:43:05,373 --> 00:43:07,466
Take a look.

634
00:43:07,509 --> 00:43:09,272
Hawking's lab is
in the physics building.

635
00:43:09,310 --> 00:43:10,675
I could just
walk right in.

636
00:43:10,712 --> 00:43:14,079
You're going
to steal cerillium?

637
00:43:14,115 --> 00:43:17,573
No, not me.

638
00:43:17,619 --> 00:43:19,280
I'm a law abiding citizen.

639
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:21,618
But perhaps there's
someone inside me.

640
00:43:21,656 --> 00:43:24,784
Someone unfettered
by the rule of law.

641
00:43:24,826 --> 00:43:29,627
Someone who will,
at any cost, survive!

642
00:43:29,664 --> 00:43:31,928
Ow!

643
00:43:31,966 --> 00:43:34,264
Oh, glass in my eye.
Glass in my eye!

644
00:43:34,302 --> 00:43:37,328
- Does it hurt?
- Uh, yeah, it hurts.

645
00:43:37,372 --> 00:43:40,899
Well, if you could spread...
spread them with your fingers.

646
00:43:40,942 --> 00:43:42,910
Push your lids
with your fingers.

647
00:43:42,944 --> 00:43:44,809
- Two... two... two fingers.
- Are your fingers clean?

648
00:43:44,846 --> 00:43:47,007
That's it. And roll
your eyeball around.

649
00:43:47,048 --> 00:43:48,777
- And push it.
- I'm rolling it!

650
00:43:48,817 --> 00:43:51,115
Dig it out with
another piece of glass.

651
00:43:51,152 --> 00:43:52,847
Are you fricking insane?

652
00:43:52,887 --> 00:43:54,912
I'll get the tweezers.

653
00:43:56,558 --> 00:43:58,856
Read about the Dragonfly,
world's greatest hero.

654
00:43:58,893 --> 00:44:00,520
- Right here?
- Right here, yup.

655
00:44:00,562 --> 00:44:02,052
Read all about it.

656
00:44:13,708 --> 00:44:16,006
No, you listen to me!

657
00:44:16,044 --> 00:44:18,672
I want that story
on my desk or you're fired!

658
00:44:18,713 --> 00:44:19,873
Who the hell are you?

659
00:44:19,914 --> 00:44:21,973
I was wondering if you've
got a job opening for...

660
00:44:22,016 --> 00:44:25,383
Job?! How dare you come in here
and ask me for a job?

661
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:28,389
I'm the editor in chief!
I know the mayor of Venus!

662
00:44:28,423 --> 00:44:30,618
Hamburgers can see
the future!

663
00:44:30,658 --> 00:44:32,182
- Rosie O'Donnell...
- Sorry about this.

664
00:44:32,227 --> 00:44:34,161
We share the building
with a mental hospital.

665
00:44:34,195 --> 00:44:37,096
Bad news, boss. We're nowhere on
those Dragonfly photos.

666
00:44:37,132 --> 00:44:39,396
Damn. Those were
tomorrow's lead.

667
00:44:39,434 --> 00:44:41,561
What about these?

668
00:44:44,873 --> 00:44:49,207
Wow! it's almost like
you're the Dragonfly.

669
00:44:49,244 --> 00:44:50,871
Uh, no no no.
See?

670
00:44:50,912 --> 00:44:53,346
Look.

671
00:44:53,381 --> 00:44:55,281
Now that's photography.

672
00:44:55,316 --> 00:44:58,012
Just heard on the scanner, some kind
of police standoff at Empire University.

673
00:44:58,052 --> 00:45:00,987
We'll need photos.
Kid, I want you to...

674
00:45:01,022 --> 00:45:02,956
Where'd he go?

675
00:45:08,930 --> 00:45:11,262
Come on, let's go!

676
00:45:18,139 --> 00:45:21,108
This is the chief of police.
We have the building surrounded.

677
00:45:21,142 --> 00:45:22,837
Come out with your hands up.

678
00:45:26,047 --> 00:45:28,447
What the hell is that?

679
00:45:41,896 --> 00:45:44,660
I am the Hourglass.

680
00:45:44,699 --> 00:45:47,725
And your time is up.

681
00:45:57,712 --> 00:45:59,577
Get him, Dragonfly.

682
00:46:07,055 --> 00:46:09,080
It's over, Hourglass.

683
00:46:09,123 --> 00:46:11,785
No, Dragonfly.

684
00:46:21,669 --> 00:46:24,536
It's just begun!

685
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:28,631
It's useless to resist.

686
00:46:28,676 --> 00:46:30,541
I'll fight you
to my last breath.

687
00:46:30,578 --> 00:46:34,446
Like the sands of time
I am unceasing and relentless.

688
00:46:34,482 --> 00:46:36,382
Evil never triumphs,
Hourglass.

689
00:46:36,417 --> 00:46:39,318
You'll pay for your crimes
and justice will...

690
00:46:39,354 --> 00:46:41,481
stop!
Stop!

691
00:46:41,522 --> 00:46:43,513
Stop!

692
00:46:43,558 --> 00:46:45,856
Are you okay?

693
00:46:45,893 --> 00:46:49,021
No.

694
00:46:52,867 --> 00:46:54,801
Titanium blades.

695
00:46:54,836 --> 00:46:56,531
They cut through diamonds.

696
00:46:56,571 --> 00:46:59,062
I'm not wearing any diamonds.

697
00:47:01,909 --> 00:47:03,570
Ooh, ow!

698
00:47:04,679 --> 00:47:06,909
Ow!

699
00:47:06,948 --> 00:47:10,111
I wish I could stay longer,
Dragonfly.

700
00:47:10,151 --> 00:47:13,484
But I just don't
have the time.

701
00:47:19,327 --> 00:47:23,093
Whoever this Dragonfly is,
he's in over his head.

702
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:25,292
We don't need so-called
superheroes.

703
00:47:25,333 --> 00:47:27,563
What Empire City needs
is more cops.

704
00:47:27,602 --> 00:47:29,502
And a Hooters.

705
00:47:31,539 --> 00:47:34,975
Titanium blades. Looks like someone
found your weakness.

706
00:47:35,009 --> 00:47:36,533
It's not my weakness.

707
00:47:36,577 --> 00:47:39,808
I'm sorry, I forgot.
Your weakness is you can't fly.

708
00:47:39,847 --> 00:47:41,212
Maybe if you had a partner.

709
00:47:41,249 --> 00:47:42,511
I don't need help.

710
00:47:46,321 --> 00:47:49,518
I'm fine all by myself.

711
00:47:49,557 --> 00:47:51,457
She means a lot to you,
doesn't she?

712
00:47:51,492 --> 00:47:53,756
What?
Oh, no.

713
00:47:53,795 --> 00:47:56,389
I mean, she's with
someone else.

714
00:47:56,431 --> 00:47:58,194
Well, maybe
that's for the best.

715
00:47:58,232 --> 00:48:00,029
After all,
it could be dangerous,

716
00:48:00,068 --> 00:48:02,502
you know, being the girlfriend
of the Dragonfly.

717
00:48:02,537 --> 00:48:04,562
I don't know what
to do, Aunt Lucille.

718
00:48:04,605 --> 00:48:06,596
- I love her.
- So be it.

719
00:48:06,641 --> 00:48:08,541
But remember,
to get to you

720
00:48:08,576 --> 00:48:12,239
your enemies will attack
the people you care for the most.

721
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:16,080
Be careful not to hurt
the ones you love.

722
00:48:17,719 --> 00:48:19,653
And shave your pubes.

723
00:48:19,687 --> 00:48:22,212
No one wants to go down
on a tumbleweed.

724
00:48:33,034 --> 00:48:34,899
Jill!

725
00:48:34,936 --> 00:48:36,335
Rick?

726
00:48:36,371 --> 00:48:38,498
I heard you were auditioning
for a part so...

727
00:48:38,539 --> 00:48:40,507
Oh, they're beautiful.

728
00:48:40,541 --> 00:48:42,805
God, you are so supportive.

729
00:48:42,844 --> 00:48:45,813
Why can't Lance
be more like you?

730
00:48:47,915 --> 00:48:50,509
There's something you're not
telling me, isn't there?

731
00:48:50,551 --> 00:48:51,950
Something secret.

732
00:48:51,986 --> 00:48:54,750
Something locked away
deep inside.

733
00:48:54,789 --> 00:48:56,950
It was summer camp.
We had to share a shower.

734
00:48:56,991 --> 00:48:59,084
You trip and fall with your mouth
open on one guys...

735
00:48:59,127 --> 00:49:00,754
No!

736
00:49:00,795 --> 00:49:04,231
I mean, in here.

737
00:49:07,101 --> 00:49:10,195
Well, there is...

738
00:49:11,739 --> 00:49:14,503
Keep your identity a secret, Rick.

739
00:49:16,778 --> 00:49:19,804
Dude, you're like a real superhero, man!

740
00:49:19,847 --> 00:49:23,180
Once a month
you'll bleed from you vagina.

741
00:49:26,254 --> 00:49:27,983
I...

742
00:49:28,022 --> 00:49:30,149
nothing.

743
00:49:31,692 --> 00:49:34,593
Nothing?

744
00:49:37,832 --> 00:49:39,629
Well, I should go.

745
00:49:40,802 --> 00:49:43,270
You're a good friend.

746
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:46,441
Hey, check this out.

747
00:49:46,441 --> 00:49:49,569
Hey, check this out.

748
00:49:49,610 --> 00:49:51,475
Oh, shit.

749
00:49:53,448 --> 00:49:55,541
- Let's go.
- Get her.

750
00:50:37,124 --> 00:50:39,388
Oh God, it hurts.
It hurts.

751
00:50:39,427 --> 00:50:42,021
Please stop!
I'm begging you!

752
00:50:56,210 --> 00:50:58,838
Wait!

753
00:51:00,515 --> 00:51:03,507
- Where are you?
- Behind you.

754
00:51:05,786 --> 00:51:07,811
You saved my life.

755
00:51:07,855 --> 00:51:10,221
Do I get to thank you?

756
00:51:53,234 --> 00:51:55,498
Go.
Be a hero.

757
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:14,549
Yeah.

758
00:52:24,765 --> 00:52:26,756
It looks like you're planning
a mass murder.

759
00:52:26,801 --> 00:52:28,666
Would you like help?

760
00:52:28,703 --> 00:52:30,295
Paper clip guy.

761
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:49,819
I'm so happy that you
and your boyfriend

762
00:52:49,857 --> 00:52:51,848
are spending Thanksgiving
with us.

763
00:52:51,892 --> 00:52:53,826
Of course, Lucille.

764
00:52:53,861 --> 00:52:55,761
You need support
at a time like this.

765
00:52:55,796 --> 00:52:59,323
Yes, I miss seeing
my Albert each morning.

766
00:52:59,367 --> 00:53:01,699
You know, 50 years
of marriage

767
00:53:01,736 --> 00:53:03,670
creates quite a bond.

768
00:53:03,704 --> 00:53:05,501
I wish I knew love
like that.

769
00:53:05,539 --> 00:53:07,268
Oh, you will, dear.

770
00:53:07,308 --> 00:53:10,004
You just have to
follow your heart.

771
00:53:10,044 --> 00:53:12,808
That's the thing.
I don't know if I can.

772
00:53:12,847 --> 00:53:14,542
Oh, Jill.

773
00:53:14,582 --> 00:53:18,109
If you can't trust yourself
who can you trust?

774
00:53:18,152 --> 00:53:19,881
I know.

775
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,911
But what if my heart
is telling me to be with someone

776
00:53:21,956 --> 00:53:23,321
I can't be with?

777
00:53:23,357 --> 00:53:25,120
It's not just any guy.
It's the...

778
00:53:25,159 --> 00:53:27,457
forget it.
You'll think I'm crazy.

779
00:53:27,495 --> 00:53:29,053
No, of course not.

780
00:53:29,096 --> 00:53:31,064
You can tell me anything.

781
00:53:31,098 --> 00:53:33,157
I'm very good
at keeping secrets.

782
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:35,794
You'll think it's
ridiculous, but...

783
00:53:35,836 --> 00:53:38,168
it's the Drag...

784
00:53:38,205 --> 00:53:39,729
- I'll get it.
- Thank you.

785
00:53:41,976 --> 00:53:44,911
Hey, babe.

786
00:53:44,945 --> 00:53:48,142
Oh, I forgot to tell you
I kinda invited my uncle.

787
00:53:48,182 --> 00:53:51,447
- Your uncle?
- What? Set another plate.

788
00:53:51,485 --> 00:53:53,385
Well, okay.
I guess.

789
00:53:53,421 --> 00:53:56,879
Miss Johnson. Please,
excuse my nephew's poor manners.

790
00:53:56,924 --> 00:53:59,950
- Thank you.
- Mrs. Adams, I'm Lou Landers.

791
00:53:59,994 --> 00:54:02,019
I hope this isn't
too much of an imposition.

792
00:54:02,063 --> 00:54:04,930
Oh, of course not.
There's always room for one more.

793
00:54:04,965 --> 00:54:06,262
Thank you.

794
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:08,393
It's just Thanksgiving
is for family.

795
00:54:08,436 --> 00:54:10,370
Lance is the only family
I have.

796
00:54:10,404 --> 00:54:12,338
- I never married.
- Fruitcake?

797
00:54:12,373 --> 00:54:14,705
Nope, just never met
the right woman.

798
00:54:14,742 --> 00:54:18,576
Ah, yes, Lance told me
Rick Riker was your neighbor.

799
00:54:18,612 --> 00:54:20,307
Where is Rick?

800
00:54:23,050 --> 00:54:25,610
That's odd.

801
00:54:25,653 --> 00:54:28,747
I thought he was out.
I'll go check on him.

802
00:54:28,789 --> 00:54:31,417
Please, you're busy.
Allow me.

803
00:54:31,459 --> 00:54:33,984
Thank you.
Upstairs, second door to the right.

804
00:54:51,045 --> 00:54:52,876
Rick?

805
00:55:03,691 --> 00:55:05,488
Hmmm.

806
00:55:14,435 --> 00:55:15,766
Hmmm.

807
00:56:32,513 --> 00:56:35,243
Sorry I'm late.

808
00:56:35,282 --> 00:56:38,115
Oh, Mr. Landers.

809
00:56:38,152 --> 00:56:39,949
Rick.

810
00:56:39,987 --> 00:56:41,921
No, you're just on time.

811
00:56:41,956 --> 00:56:44,151
Everybody,
take your seat.

812
00:56:44,191 --> 00:56:45,715
Ohhh.

813
00:56:45,759 --> 00:56:48,728
Ah ah ah!
Not till we say grace.

814
00:56:48,762 --> 00:56:50,525
Jesus!

815
00:56:50,564 --> 00:56:51,963
Amen.

816
00:56:53,567 --> 00:56:55,194
Please start,
everyone.

817
00:56:55,236 --> 00:56:57,170
This all looks
so delicious, Lucille.

818
00:56:57,204 --> 00:57:00,105
We have Rick
to thank for it.

819
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:02,734
Ever since Albert...

820
00:57:02,776 --> 00:57:05,939
Rick has been supporting me
with his new job.

821
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:08,244
New job?
You didn't tell me.

822
00:57:08,282 --> 00:57:12,275
Oh well, I'm sort of the Dragonfly's
unofficial photographer.

823
00:57:15,589 --> 00:57:17,216
What happened to your arm?

824
00:57:18,959 --> 00:57:20,859
Uh...

825
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:23,386
a bike messenger
knocked me down.

826
00:57:24,632 --> 00:57:26,759
I see
your wrist is bandaged.

827
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:29,769
Yes, I burned it
on some hot coffee.

828
00:57:29,803 --> 00:57:31,771
And you have a cut on your lip.

829
00:57:31,805 --> 00:57:33,739
Uh...

830
00:57:33,774 --> 00:57:36,470
my crackpipe broke.

831
00:57:37,945 --> 00:57:40,345
You have a scratch
on your neck.

832
00:57:40,381 --> 00:57:42,781
Yes, I...

833
00:57:42,816 --> 00:57:45,614
met a girl
on Craigslist.

834
00:57:45,653 --> 00:57:47,712
And you have a bruise
on your neck.

835
00:57:47,755 --> 00:57:49,689
I...

836
00:57:49,723 --> 00:57:52,021
met a guy
on Craigslist.

837
00:57:54,795 --> 00:57:57,320
I'm sorry, Lance.
We have to go.

838
00:57:57,364 --> 00:57:59,855
- Why?
- I...

839
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:01,891
shat my pants.

840
00:58:03,337 --> 00:58:05,202
I'll drive.

841
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:21,679
- Thanks for helping clean up.
- Of course.

842
00:58:21,722 --> 00:58:24,418
Poor thing's so tired.

843
00:58:24,458 --> 00:58:27,120
Yeah, well, you know
old folks after a big meal.

844
00:58:27,161 --> 00:58:30,096
So... you know the Dragonfly?

845
00:58:30,130 --> 00:58:31,893
Uh...

846
00:58:31,932 --> 00:58:33,593
yeah, I guess.

847
00:58:33,634 --> 00:58:35,898
You could sorta say
we're close.

848
00:58:35,936 --> 00:58:39,303
Has he...
has he ever asked about me?

849
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:41,331
Um, yeah.

850
00:58:41,375 --> 00:58:43,843
- Yeah, once.
- What did you tell him?

851
00:58:45,346 --> 00:58:47,211
Well, I said...

852
00:58:47,247 --> 00:58:48,339
I told him...

853
00:58:49,416 --> 00:58:52,283
I told him, "The thing
about Jill is...

854
00:58:52,319 --> 00:58:55,777
when you look in her eyes
and she looks back in yours...

855
00:59:00,327 --> 00:59:02,022
- you know that
you'd do anything

856
00:59:02,062 --> 00:59:04,690
anything to be a better person
than you are.

857
00:59:04,732 --> 00:59:06,324
So that...

858
00:59:07,735 --> 00:59:10,761
- if you were ever
lucky enough to be with her,

859
00:59:10,804 --> 00:59:13,830
you could earn every second
of her perfect...

860
00:59:20,714 --> 00:59:23,808
- grace,
and her limitless beauty...

861
00:59:28,856 --> 00:59:30,847
- and her unending love.

862
00:59:33,193 --> 00:59:34,683
- Don't cry.
- I'm not.

863
00:59:34,728 --> 00:59:36,628
My eyes are burning.

864
00:59:38,499 --> 00:59:40,228
Rick, I want you to know

865
00:59:40,267 --> 00:59:42,258
that was the most
beautiful thing

866
00:59:42,302 --> 00:59:44,133
anyone's ever said to me.

867
00:59:49,777 --> 00:59:52,371
- Scented candle?
- Thank you.

868
00:59:53,781 --> 00:59:57,239
Rick, I'm so confused, and yet...

869
00:59:58,786 --> 01:00:01,118
- I know exactly
what I want.

870
01:00:20,407 --> 01:00:23,137
Sorry to drop in uninvited.

871
01:00:23,177 --> 01:00:26,340
It's okay. We were hoping someone
would open a window.

872
01:00:26,380 --> 01:00:28,848
It was getting stuffy
in here.

873
01:00:28,882 --> 01:00:32,409
So this is the lair
of the Dragonfly.

874
01:00:32,453 --> 01:00:35,354
- How did you...
- No no no,

875
01:00:35,389 --> 01:00:39,758
I'm not here to fight you. I've got
thousands of other people I plan to kill.

876
01:00:39,793 --> 01:00:43,024
This little visit
is just to show you

877
01:00:43,063 --> 01:00:46,590
who'll get hurt
if you get in my way.

878
01:00:46,633 --> 01:00:48,601
Never!

879
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:03,279
Time to go.

880
01:01:08,889 --> 01:01:11,380
The woman, Lucille Adams
of East Empire City,

881
01:01:11,425 --> 01:01:13,825
- was badly injured.
- How was she injured?

882
01:01:13,861 --> 01:01:15,692
- Badly.
- What about the Dragonfly?

883
01:01:15,729 --> 01:01:17,720
All I can tell you is this:

884
01:01:17,764 --> 01:01:20,028
he didn't save
anyone tonight.

885
01:01:20,067 --> 01:01:22,501
Doctor, how is she?

886
01:01:22,536 --> 01:01:24,970
I'm afraid your aunt's
taken a turn for the worse.

887
01:01:25,005 --> 01:01:28,099
She can't speak, she can't walk,
she had no control over her bowels.

888
01:01:28,142 --> 01:01:29,507
That's... that's awful.

889
01:01:29,543 --> 01:01:32,034
I know. I went ahead and set up
a MySpace page for her

890
01:01:32,079 --> 01:01:34,639
under "crazy shit machine."

891
01:01:34,681 --> 01:01:36,308
She already has 40 friends.

892
01:01:36,350 --> 01:01:38,648
Wait a minute.
That's somebody else's aunt.

893
01:01:38,685 --> 01:01:40,949
Your aunt has no problem
with her bowels...

894
01:01:40,988 --> 01:01:42,922
- Oh, thank God.
...because she's dead.

895
01:01:42,956 --> 01:01:46,119
I'm truly sorry, Rick,
but there is a silver lining.

896
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:48,492
Your uncle came out
of his coma this morning.

897
01:01:48,529 --> 01:01:49,757
He did?

898
01:01:49,796 --> 01:01:52,788
Yes, but you mustn't tell him about
your aunt just yet.

899
01:01:52,833 --> 01:01:55,802
He's in a delicate mental state.
The slightest bit of bad news

900
01:01:55,836 --> 01:01:58,464
could send him spiraling
right back into a coma.

901
01:01:58,505 --> 01:02:00,302
I understand.

902
01:02:02,476 --> 01:02:04,876
Mr. Adams,
you have a visitor.

903
01:02:04,912 --> 01:02:07,972
- Is it Lucille?
- No, sir, it's not your dead wife.

904
01:02:08,015 --> 01:02:09,812
It's your nephew Rick.

905
01:02:09,850 --> 01:02:12,045
Remember, no bad news.

906
01:02:12,085 --> 01:02:14,952
Now, sir, here you go.
This is my bill.

907
01:02:14,988 --> 01:02:18,480
- You did surgery on me?
- Yes, sir, we confused you

908
01:02:18,525 --> 01:02:20,390
with one of our
sex-change patients,

909
01:02:20,427 --> 01:02:22,725
but don't worry,
we didn't remove your penis.

910
01:02:22,763 --> 01:02:25,698
We did cut your testicles off, but, well,
since your wife's dead,

911
01:02:25,732 --> 01:02:27,324
you won't be
needing them anyway.

912
01:02:27,367 --> 01:02:29,164
You just want
to keep his spirits up.

913
01:02:29,203 --> 01:02:31,330
He'll land on his feet
in no time.

914
01:02:32,906 --> 01:02:36,069
We are gathered today to say goodbye

915
01:02:36,109 --> 01:02:38,976
- to Lucille Adams.
- Goodbye!

916
01:02:39,012 --> 01:02:41,674
And now the eulogy.

917
01:02:41,715 --> 01:02:44,081
It's tragic to think this is the last time

918
01:02:44,117 --> 01:02:46,585
that I can look
upon my wife's face.

919
01:02:46,620 --> 01:02:48,850
God, Lucille!

920
01:02:48,889 --> 01:02:53,189
How could you take her from me?
I can't live without her!

921
01:02:53,227 --> 01:02:55,161
Ahhh!

922
01:02:55,195 --> 01:02:57,561
Lucille!
Snookie lumps!

923
01:02:57,598 --> 01:02:59,566
I'm sorry, there's been
a terrible mistake.

924
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:02,467
- This is your wife.
- Ah!

925
01:03:02,502 --> 01:03:04,663
She is this man's wife.

926
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:09,908
Give me five minutes.

927
01:03:13,780 --> 01:03:15,645
- Uncle Albert!
- I'm not finished.

928
01:03:20,387 --> 01:03:22,617
You're one lucky guy.
Now...

929
01:03:22,656 --> 01:03:24,146
where's Lucille?

930
01:03:24,191 --> 01:03:27,285
Ah, Lucille!

931
01:03:33,767 --> 01:03:36,702
I do have this coupon
for a cremation.

932
01:03:41,141 --> 01:03:42,699
Rick?

933
01:03:44,044 --> 01:03:46,535
I am so sorry
for your loss.

934
01:03:48,782 --> 01:03:50,807
What is it?

935
01:03:50,851 --> 01:03:52,978
I know I said some things,

936
01:03:53,020 --> 01:03:55,011
but now more than ever,
I realize...

937
01:03:56,423 --> 01:03:58,357
we can never be together.

938
01:03:58,392 --> 01:04:01,122
I don't believe you.

939
01:04:02,896 --> 01:04:06,297
You love me, Rick.
I know you do.

940
01:04:06,333 --> 01:04:09,734
Jill, trust me.
I'm telling you this for your own good.

941
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:15,471
I don't love you.

942
01:04:17,511 --> 01:04:19,502
You're no longer
in my five.

943
01:04:21,081 --> 01:04:23,049
How could you?

944
01:04:29,122 --> 01:04:30,851
# When I was young #

945
01:04:32,125 --> 01:04:35,526
# I never needed anyone #

946
01:04:37,964 --> 01:04:41,695
# Makin' love
was just for fun #

947
01:04:43,370 --> 01:04:46,168
# Those days are gone #

948
01:04:53,246 --> 01:04:59,344
# All by myself #

949
01:04:59,386 --> 01:05:02,014
# Don't wanna be #

950
01:05:02,055 --> 01:05:06,924
# All by myself #

951
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:08,791
# Anymore #

952
01:05:09,963 --> 01:05:15,265
# All by myself #

953
01:05:16,670 --> 01:05:18,160
# Don't wanna be #

954
01:05:18,205 --> 01:05:22,938
# All by myself. #

955
01:05:22,976 --> 01:05:26,468
# Anymore #

956
01:05:26,513 --> 01:05:32,213
# All by myself #

957
01:05:32,252 --> 01:05:34,379
# Don't want to be #

958
01:05:34,421 --> 01:05:38,881
# All by myself #

959
01:05:38,925 --> 01:05:42,224
# Anymore #

960
01:05:42,262 --> 01:05:46,722
# All by myself. #

961
01:05:52,439 --> 01:05:54,270
You can't keep
getting lucky, man.

962
01:05:54,307 --> 01:05:56,537
You only beat me
by two strokes this time.

963
01:05:56,576 --> 01:05:58,976
And the back nine
is what killed.

964
01:05:59,012 --> 01:06:00,809
Oh my God!

965
01:06:00,847 --> 01:06:03,645
- Look at this place.
- Yo, what are you doing, man?

966
01:06:03,683 --> 01:06:05,844
You gotta pull
yourself together, dude.

967
01:06:05,886 --> 01:06:09,253
What's the point?

968
01:06:13,460 --> 01:06:15,485
Look at you...
eating junk food,

969
01:06:15,529 --> 01:06:19,124
wearing fake beards,

970
01:06:19,166 --> 01:06:22,294
and we found your costume
in the garbage outside.

971
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:24,826
Yeah, well, I'm not
the Dragonfly anymore.

972
01:06:24,871 --> 01:06:27,704
But you said the Hourglass
was going to kill thousands of people.

973
01:06:27,741 --> 01:06:30,938
I told you I'm no hero.
All right? Aunt Lucille's dead,

974
01:06:30,977 --> 01:06:32,808
I've rejected the only girl
I've ever loved

975
01:06:32,846 --> 01:06:35,144
and I can't even fly.

976
01:06:36,616 --> 01:06:39,949
I wish I'd never been bitten
by that stupid dragonfly.

977
01:06:39,986 --> 01:06:43,183
And maybe your father
shouldn't have given you this after all.

978
01:06:43,223 --> 01:06:46,852
Look at the words
your ancestors inscribed in that ring.

979
01:06:46,893 --> 01:06:50,090
"Honor, valor, sacrifice,

980
01:06:50,130 --> 01:06:52,530
duty, commitment,
bravery, justice,

981
01:06:52,566 --> 01:06:54,363
integrity, brotherhood,

982
01:06:54,401 --> 01:06:57,529
self-esteem, low prices,
affordable housing,

983
01:06:57,571 --> 01:07:00,233
loose-fitting pants,
cheap internet porn."

984
01:07:01,241 --> 01:07:03,232
The rest is in Latin.

985
01:07:03,276 --> 01:07:05,540
Rick, the hero's path
is dangerous.

986
01:07:05,579 --> 01:07:09,276
You may fail or you may fly.
All that matters

987
01:07:09,316 --> 01:07:12,479
is that you do it
for the best of reasons.

988
01:07:12,519 --> 01:07:14,510
Helping others, Rick,

989
01:07:14,554 --> 01:07:16,920
that's what makes you
a real hero.

990
01:07:18,592 --> 01:07:20,423
Maybe you're right,

991
01:07:20,460 --> 01:07:22,894
but even if I wanted to stop
the Hourglass,

992
01:07:22,929 --> 01:07:24,794
I wouldn't know
where to start.

993
01:07:24,831 --> 01:07:27,595
I mean, where's he gonna
find thousands of people in one place?

994
01:07:27,634 --> 01:07:30,125
Look.

995
01:07:30,170 --> 01:07:33,003
Reporting here live from the
Empire City convention center

996
01:07:33,039 --> 01:07:35,473
where thousands of people
are in one place,

997
01:07:35,509 --> 01:07:37,602
but none of them
more important

998
01:07:37,644 --> 01:07:40,044
than the attendees
of the World Humanity Awards.

999
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:42,514
I'll drive.

1000
01:07:44,985 --> 01:07:49,115
Well, that shortcut through the playground
sure saved us some time.

1001
01:07:49,155 --> 01:07:51,316
You go ahead,

1002
01:07:51,358 --> 01:07:53,622
I'll find
a place to park.

1003
01:07:55,662 --> 01:07:57,994
Mister, please stop!

1004
01:07:58,031 --> 01:08:00,499
Each year
the World Humanity Awards

1005
01:08:00,534 --> 01:08:02,798
are held to honor
the greatest achievements

1006
01:08:02,836 --> 01:08:05,100
on behalf of all humanity.

1007
01:08:05,138 --> 01:08:07,163
This gala event
is expected to draw

1008
01:08:07,207 --> 01:08:09,903
the world's most prestigious
leaders to Empire City.

1009
01:08:09,943 --> 01:08:12,173
- Excuse us, excuse us!
- "Empire City Times."

1010
01:08:12,212 --> 01:08:15,443
Damn! Look,
there go Prince Charles.

1011
01:08:15,482 --> 01:08:17,507
And Nelson Mandela.
Nelson!

1012
01:08:17,551 --> 01:08:19,382
Hey, I was
in jail too, man.

1013
01:08:21,254 --> 01:08:23,779
One of the guests here
is the Hourglass.

1014
01:08:23,823 --> 01:08:25,688
But which one?

1015
01:08:27,327 --> 01:08:29,591
Thank you so much
for inviting us, Mr. Landers.

1016
01:08:29,629 --> 01:08:31,824
Well, when you're being
honored by the world,

1017
01:08:31,865 --> 01:08:33,423
you want
your family with you.

1018
01:08:35,101 --> 01:08:38,537
Perhaps one day, you could
be part of our family too.

1019
01:08:39,873 --> 01:08:42,603
Ladies and gentlemen,
our first award

1020
01:08:42,642 --> 01:08:45,406
is for the medical
breakthrough of the year.

1021
01:08:45,445 --> 01:08:47,640
For his company's
pioneering work

1022
01:08:47,681 --> 01:08:50,149
in the field
of feminine hygiene

1023
01:08:50,183 --> 01:08:53,050
I award Lou Landers
douchebag of the year.

1024
01:08:54,754 --> 01:08:57,314
# Douchebag #

1025
01:08:57,357 --> 01:09:00,326
# He's the douchebag
of the year #

1026
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:02,920
# Now ain't
he great, folks? #

1027
01:09:02,963 --> 01:09:06,091
# Ain't he grand?
The douchebag of the year. #

1028
01:09:11,738 --> 01:09:14,730
# Douchebag #

1029
01:09:14,774 --> 01:09:18,210
# He's Mr. Douchebag
of the year #

1030
01:09:18,244 --> 01:09:20,838
# Look at him smile,
look at him shine #

1031
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:24,509
# He's the douchebag of,
the douchebag of the year. #

1032
01:09:24,551 --> 01:09:28,112
Hold up the douchebag!
Hold up the douchebag, sir.

1033
01:09:30,724 --> 01:09:32,988
Stop right there, Landers.

1034
01:09:33,026 --> 01:09:35,460
Mr. Riker.
So...

1035
01:09:35,495 --> 01:09:36,962
you know.

1036
01:09:36,997 --> 01:09:39,158
You're damn right I do.

1037
01:09:40,567 --> 01:09:42,865
Someone in this auditorium
is the Hourglass.

1038
01:09:42,902 --> 01:09:45,962
I need your help
to figure out who it is.

1039
01:09:46,006 --> 01:09:48,133
Now the Hourglass
could be anyone...

1040
01:09:48,174 --> 01:09:50,199
a guest of honor...

1041
01:09:50,243 --> 01:09:52,143
maybe even
a stagehand.

1042
01:09:57,584 --> 01:10:00,678
This may be nothing,
but I did see a man

1043
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:03,382
with what looked like
a canister of

1044
01:10:03,423 --> 01:10:04,754
cerillium.

1045
01:10:04,791 --> 01:10:06,383
Who?

1046
01:10:06,426 --> 01:10:08,894
- This year's lifetime achievement award...
- Him.

1047
01:10:08,928 --> 01:10:11,658
...goes to one of the world's
greatest souls,

1048
01:10:11,698 --> 01:10:14,496
His Holiness,
the Dalai Lama.

1049
01:10:21,141 --> 01:10:24,008
This man isn't who you think
he is, he's the Hourglass.

1050
01:10:24,044 --> 01:10:26,171
No no,
I'm a man of peace.

1051
01:10:26,212 --> 01:10:29,010
Shut up! You're plotting
to kill all these people

1052
01:10:29,049 --> 01:10:30,880
and I can prove it.
Show the world

1053
01:10:30,917 --> 01:10:33,647
the armor you're hiding
under these robes.

1054
01:10:34,821 --> 01:10:36,345
You can't fool me,
Hourglass.

1055
01:10:36,389 --> 01:10:39,017
You're packing 10 lbs
of Cerillium under there.

1056
01:10:39,059 --> 01:10:40,117
- What?
- Ahh!

1057
01:10:43,797 --> 01:10:45,526
Take him down.

1058
01:10:49,803 --> 01:10:51,896
Tutu.

1059
01:10:56,543 --> 01:10:57,942
Peace!

1060
01:10:57,977 --> 01:10:59,342
Pea...

1061
01:11:09,189 --> 01:11:11,487
Shit shit shit shit shit.

1062
01:11:15,695 --> 01:11:18,061
You!

1063
01:11:18,098 --> 01:11:19,827
You're the Hourglass.

1064
01:11:22,102 --> 01:11:24,536
It's a pity you saw that,
my dear.

1065
01:11:24,571 --> 01:11:29,372
Perhaps this will help
you forget.

1066
01:11:35,281 --> 01:11:36,976
What are you doing?

1067
01:11:39,219 --> 01:11:41,380
Take me.

1068
01:11:59,572 --> 01:12:01,369
Hourglass!

1069
01:12:08,581 --> 01:12:11,414
- Hero con?
- It's a convention for people

1070
01:12:11,451 --> 01:12:14,284
who like to dress up
as their favorite heroes and villains.

1071
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:16,948
- By the way, your costume sucks.
- Out of my way!

1072
01:12:18,792 --> 01:12:21,260
Excuse me,
there is a line.

1073
01:12:22,695 --> 01:12:24,890
No, you're killing him
all wrong.

1074
01:12:24,931 --> 01:12:27,900
It's like this.

1075
01:12:27,934 --> 01:12:30,801
Better.

1076
01:12:32,405 --> 01:12:33,497
Oh, shit.

1077
01:12:49,289 --> 01:12:51,780
Hourglass, you'll never
get away with this!

1078
01:12:51,825 --> 01:12:55,261
Forget it, Dragonfly.
You're too late.

1079
01:12:57,197 --> 01:12:59,165
Run!

1080
01:13:02,468 --> 01:13:03,799
Yeah.

1081
01:13:14,647 --> 01:13:16,774
Goodbye...

1082
01:13:18,251 --> 01:13:19,275
little fly.

1083
01:13:21,855 --> 01:13:23,823
Dragonfly!

1084
01:13:24,858 --> 01:13:27,326
- No!
- Ahhh!

1085
01:13:46,112 --> 01:13:48,307
My eye!

1086
01:13:49,883 --> 01:13:53,478
So, are you gonna
keep the body, or...

1087
01:14:01,694 --> 01:14:03,093
Eh.

1088
01:14:03,129 --> 01:14:07,463
Dragonfly, you must
stop the Hourglass.

1089
01:14:09,235 --> 01:14:11,203
I can't.

1090
01:14:11,237 --> 01:14:13,205
I can't fly.

1091
01:14:13,239 --> 01:14:15,935
If there is one lesson
my life can teach,

1092
01:14:15,975 --> 01:14:19,467
it is that the spirit
is stronger than the body.

1093
01:14:19,512 --> 01:14:21,742
The hero comes from within.

1094
01:14:21,781 --> 01:14:23,874
Those are
Celine Dion lyrics.

1095
01:14:23,917 --> 01:14:26,943
Whatever.
It's still true.

1096
01:14:28,187 --> 01:14:29,518
You're right.

1097
01:14:36,696 --> 01:14:38,687
It's working.

1098
01:14:40,333 --> 01:14:42,233
Sorry.

1099
01:14:43,236 --> 01:14:44,726
Watch, Dragonfly,

1100
01:14:44,771 --> 01:14:47,001
as your city dies.

1101
01:14:58,851 --> 01:15:01,046
Where... am I?

1102
01:15:01,087 --> 01:15:03,317
You're with me,

1103
01:15:03,356 --> 01:15:05,790
your lover.

1104
01:15:11,397 --> 01:15:12,830
Dragonfly!

1105
01:15:14,968 --> 01:15:16,458
No.

1106
01:15:18,638 --> 01:15:22,335
- No.
- Only now do you understand.

1107
01:15:23,609 --> 01:15:26,476
Oh, come...

1108
01:15:27,780 --> 01:15:29,213
Aha!

1109
01:15:30,550 --> 01:15:32,450
I need you to jerk this off.

1110
01:15:34,620 --> 01:15:36,053
Yeah.

1111
01:15:36,089 --> 01:15:37,556
There's not enough time.

1112
01:15:40,293 --> 01:15:41,988
Oh fuck.

1113
01:15:49,035 --> 01:15:52,163
- It's over.
- Dragonfly!

1114
01:15:52,205 --> 01:15:54,196
Jill!

1115
01:15:56,542 --> 01:15:58,407
Gotcha.

1116
01:16:00,146 --> 01:16:02,376
- Rick?
- You didn't think I'd let anything happen

1117
01:16:02,415 --> 01:16:04,315
to the girl I love, did you?

1118
01:16:04,350 --> 01:16:06,045
Well, we're still
falling.

1119
01:16:06,085 --> 01:16:09,282
Damn it!
If only I could fly.

1120
01:16:09,322 --> 01:16:11,347
Maybe I wasn't cut out
to be a hero.

1121
01:16:11,391 --> 01:16:14,383
You know, maybe I was meant
to have a normal job... an accountant,

1122
01:16:14,427 --> 01:16:15,724
a gym teacher.

1123
01:16:15,762 --> 01:16:18,697
- This is a really tall building.
- Rick!

1124
01:16:18,731 --> 01:16:20,699
I don't care
what happens anymore.

1125
01:16:20,733 --> 01:16:22,633
If I die, I die happily
in your arms.

1126
01:16:22,668 --> 01:16:25,933
You're my hero, Rick Riker,
and I love you.

1127
01:16:31,411 --> 01:16:34,312
Yes!
Oh, thank God!

1128
01:16:34,347 --> 01:16:36,247
We only have
50 stories left.

1129
01:16:36,282 --> 01:16:38,079
Hang on.

1130
01:16:48,761 --> 01:16:51,389
Thank you, Dragonfly.

1131
01:16:51,431 --> 01:16:54,229
Because of you, our city
is safe at last.

1132
01:16:54,267 --> 01:16:57,498
- You said it, Dr. Hawking.
- Shit!

1133
01:16:57,537 --> 01:16:59,698
It's a happy ending
for us all.

1134
01:16:59,739 --> 01:17:02,401
Let's go get some dinner. I'm buying.

1135
01:17:03,776 --> 01:17:06,074
Who am I?
I'm Rick Riker.

1136
01:17:06,112 --> 01:17:10,208
I'm the Dragonfly.
And as long as there's crime and injustice

1137
01:17:10,249 --> 01:17:13,218
I will forever be
a superhero...

1138
01:17:18,324 --> 01:17:20,417
I am the Hourglass!

1139
01:17:20,460 --> 01:17:24,419
# Darkness has found you,
evil surrounds you #

1140
01:17:24,464 --> 01:17:28,764
# No one to save you,
we're almost out of time #

1141
01:17:28,801 --> 01:17:31,793
# What do you do when
nothing can be done? #

1142
01:17:33,306 --> 01:17:36,298
# Where do you go
with nowhere left to run? #

1143
01:17:37,810 --> 01:17:41,837
# Where is the one
who stands up and tells you #

1144
01:17:41,881 --> 01:17:46,215
# I'm here to save you?
We're almost out of time #

1145
01:17:46,252 --> 01:17:49,312
# Nobody knows just who
he's trying to be #

1146
01:17:50,823 --> 01:17:53,656
# Behind this mask, his wings
and suit of green #

1147
01:17:55,027 --> 01:17:58,588
# Just in time to reach up
for the sky #

1148
01:17:58,631 --> 01:18:03,830
# And fly away #

1149
01:18:03,870 --> 01:18:07,169
# Don't worry you're safe #

1150
01:18:08,674 --> 01:18:12,440
# In my arms,
'cause it takes your love #

1151
01:18:12,478 --> 01:18:15,777
# To lift me up,
it's safe to say #

1152
01:18:17,116 --> 01:18:19,949
# Jill and I were always
meant to be #

1153
01:18:19,986 --> 01:18:25,185
# So I will show you why
I'm here to stay #

1154
01:18:25,224 --> 01:18:27,852
# Don't they know that
I'll protect you? #

1155
01:18:27,894 --> 01:18:30,124
# Don't they know
they'll have to get through #

1156
01:18:30,163 --> 01:18:32,757
# Me #

1157
01:18:32,798 --> 01:18:36,165
# Don't worry yourself... #

1158
01:18:42,642 --> 01:18:44,769
Your time is up!

1159
01:18:44,810 --> 01:18:47,370
# Watch out behind you #

1160
01:18:47,413 --> 01:18:49,574
# This is designed to #

1161
01:18:49,615 --> 01:18:51,810
# Quickly remind you #

1162
01:18:51,851 --> 01:18:53,876
# We're almost out of time #

1163
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:56,889
# Somebody tell me what
he's trying to be #

1164
01:18:58,424 --> 01:19:02,121
# Behind his mask, his wings,
his suit of green #

1165
01:19:02,161 --> 01:19:06,120
# Just in time to reach up
for the sky #

1166
01:19:06,165 --> 01:19:11,034
# And fly away #

1167
01:19:12,171 --> 01:19:14,731
# Don't worry you're safe #

1168
01:19:16,309 --> 01:19:20,006

1172
01:19:32,625 --> 01:19:35,219
# Don't you worry,
I'm the one #

1173
01:19:35,261 --> 01:19:37,729
# Who let's them know
that I'll protect you #

1174
01:19:37,763 --> 01:19:41,529
# Don't they know they'll
have to get through me? #

1175
01:19:42,702 --> 01:19:45,330
# Don't worry you're safe... #

1176
01:19:46,539 --> 01:19:49,770
# In my arms so green #

1177
01:19:49,809 --> 01:19:54,508
# It's easy. #

1178
01:19:54,547 --> 01:19:57,744
#I need a hero #

1179
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:03,548
#I need a hero #

1180
01:20:06,626 --> 01:20:09,356
# I'm calling out,
I want you here #

1181
01:20:09,395 --> 01:20:11,989
# This is my 011 #

1182
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:15,432
# I'm sinking down
into the fear #

1183
01:20:15,468 --> 01:20:17,527
# That I just can't outrun #

1184
01:20:17,570 --> 01:20:20,733
# To save myself
all I can see #

1185
01:20:20,773 --> 01:20:23,469
# Is that I've got
no choice #

1186
01:20:23,509 --> 01:20:26,444
# I cry for help
and pray you'll be #

1187
01:20:26,479 --> 01:20:29,175
# The one who hears
my voice #

1188
