1
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:09,600
Quinn, Jack. Your final assignment
is classification red.

2
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:15,240
At 3:05 a truck with 32 kg. of
non-active plutonium was stolen

3
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:20,160
from an American installation
outside Croatia.

4
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:26,160
Stavros and his organization will
sell it to Iraq within 24 hours.

5
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:31,280
Your objective is the safe return
of the plutonium to our base.

6
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,000
Out of the way!

7
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:43,520
Quinn's in! The XRT is mobile.

8
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,360
Quinn has 14 hours
to reach the border.

9
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,640
If he does make it,
his resignation is final.

10
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,560
Jack, would you get that?

11
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:38,040
Kathryn!
Your damn cow is in my way!

12
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:43,680
- It's not a cow, it's a swan.
- Whatever it is, it's in my way.

13
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,000
In your way?

14
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:55,080
- The swan is beautiful. So are you.
- Not for long.

15
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:06,080
You'll still be sexy.
A bit rounder, and a bit softer...

16
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:12,240
- The baby, isn't it what we want?
- Of course.

17
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,960
Bonjour, Jack.

18
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,560
- You don't believe in front doors.
- You know all about back doors.

19
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,160
- How did you find me?
- We never lost you.

20
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:42,800
- Then you know I'm retired.
- How long can you watch the sunset?

21
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,200
You're a hunter. You miss the game.

22
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:52,080
You don't get it. For me, it's
personal. For you, it's politics.

23
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:58,160
Politics makes money, opportunity.
Everything's politics.

24
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,760
You want personal? Okay...

25
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:07,320
Stavros is back.
We want him alive.

26
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:14,160
We want all his nasty information.
Names, escape routes. We need you.

27
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:18,760
You're the only guy who knows
how he works.

28
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:25,240
Come on. It's your last shot.
A Delta team is waiting in Antwerp.

29
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:30,160
Face it, Jack.
You can't retire until he does.

30
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:43,160
- Is Quinn coming back or not?
- If he's not, we go to plan B.

31
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,440
Move the seat up.
It's a little tight in the rear.

32
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:56,360
That's generally true of the CIA.

33
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:05,480
You bust drug cartels in Third World
countries and testify for Congress.

34
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:11,760
They make you a deputy director,
but you're just a minor leaguer.

35
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:18,240
You were only good for getting
Quinn back. It'll be challenging.

36
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,080
I left you a present.

37
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,120
Get me out! Help!

38
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,600
Don't tell me it's not dangerous.

39
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,880
That you're going to be back
in 36 hours.

40
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,520
I'm looking for Yaz.

41
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,880
I'm looking for Yaz.

42
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,720
I bet that hurt.

43
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:10,120
That hurt. These hurt.
But I like this one right here.

44
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,000
- Who are you?
- I'm the man.

45
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:19,400
Do you judge a person
by the way he looks? I hate that.

46
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,080
Who does your hair,
Siegfried or Roy?

47
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:27,400
The last who mocked my hair is still
pulling his head out of his ass.

48
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:31,480
I don't want to know
about your sex life.

49
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:37,480
- This has been fun. Who are you?
- Jack Quinn.

50
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:41,680
If you want to dance,
ask me nicely.

51
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:46,480
I just want to make sure it's you.

52
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:53,840
The legend walks. I heard
you dropped out of the game.

53
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:12,480
Santa's workshop!
Who's that, Rudolph?

54
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:18,840
- I have the best elves around.
- Christmas shopping for bad boys?

55
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,600
I don't play with the bad boys
any more, only the good guys.

56
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:29,480
What do you need? I got shit here
so new, I don't know I have it.

57
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,120
- Offence gets the glory.
- But defence wins the game.

58
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:44,000
I take cash, gold...
Did you open that?

59
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,400
Fire in the hole!

60
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:56,800
But no cheques. And my rule is:
You break it, you bought it.

61
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,720
Gentlemen, this is Delta 1.
Forget you ever saw him.

62
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:25,040
Mr. Yamir here says Stavros will
surface tomorrow... close to here.

63
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,240
An amusement park...

64
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,560
- Who's my dead-eye?
- Me, sir.

65
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,480
Do you know how to use it?

66
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:49,880
It's rigged for tranquilizer darts.
Can you hit a man at 200 yards?

67
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,400
I can shoot
the dick off a hummingbird.

68
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:58,840
He's like a snake. Look in his eyes,
he'll get you in the back.

69
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:04,440
When we I D Stavros, move into
position. We only have one shot.

70
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:10,360
Two darts will kill a man.
Three, a rhino. We want him alive.

71
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:43,160
Delta 5, check the two women
by the carousel.

72
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:12,720
- Something's happening.
- We have Stavros. Grey Mercedes.

73
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:18,200
- We've got three men moving.
- Let them in.

74
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,640
2 and 5, move to Baker.
Others, hold.

75
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,200
This is way too easy.

76
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,800
He's in my sight.
Ready to fire.

77
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,760
That's not Stavros!

78
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:49,440
Stavros is a lefty!
It's not him!

79
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,120
- Find the driver!
- En route to ground positions.

80
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:06,320
- We're securing the exits.
- I got him.

81
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:12,280
The woman's hiding something.
It could be a bomb.

82
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,880
My God...

83
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,960
- I'm locked on.
- 2 and 5 in position.

84
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:28,960
Ready to take him.
Why are we waiting, Delta 1?

85
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,920
Ready to move in.

86
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:39,520
- I'm waiting for your command.
- What are you waiting for?

87
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:59,560
- Clear out!
- Too late, clown boy.

88
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,760
Move to position 3.

89
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:12,360
His mother told me that his
favourite thing in the world

90
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:17,920
was riding his little pony
on the weekends.

91
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,640
He loved riding that pony.

92
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:30,600
That little horse
is going to miss my boy.

93
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:39,160
I'm a professional, Quinn.
I've killed. I've killed a lot.

94
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,000
But most of the bastards I killed
deserved to die.

95
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:51,120
My little boy was six years old.

96
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:56,320
Now that makes it personal, mister.

97
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,600
Candidate for Colony residency:

98
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:01,360
Quinn, Jack Paul. Born 1959.

99
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,680
Entered Foreign Service at 22.

100
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:10,440
Trained in demolition, tracking,
psychological countermeasures.

101
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,840
Specialty: Anti-terrorism.

102
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,880
last assignment:
Stavros acquisition.

103
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:23,240
Video segment A- 19.
Antwerp interdiction.

104
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:29,240
Quinn achieved clear opportunity
to acquire Alpha, but Alpha escaped.

105
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:35,880
You went soft. But your skills
got you assigned to the Colony.

106
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:40,800
- No!
- You do have an alternative.

107
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:47,680
Nerve gas is painless and effective.
But you are already dead.

108
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:55,800
That's what your wife thinks. If you
wish to live, scan your thumbprint.

109
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:01,400
10, 9, 8, 7, 6,

110
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:05,000
5, 4, 3, 2...

111
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:15,760
Identity confirmed.
Thank you, Mr. Quinn.

112
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:19,880
Now, was that so bad?

113
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:39,680
Jack, glad you decided to join us.

114
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,200
- Alex Goldsmythe.
- The Tax Man.

115
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:49,360
- You were killed six years ago.
- It's been six years already?

116
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,760
Climb on.
Some friends want to meet you.

117
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:01,880
Gentlemen,
come and meet the famed Jack Quinn.

118
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:11,760
- Moishe Levant, died in Lebanon.
- Beirut.

119
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:19,480
- Everybody... all ex-agents.
- Or ex-enemies.

120
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:23,880
We're too valuable to kill
and too dangerous to set free.

121
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:27,200
Welcome to the Colony.

122
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:32,320
- Quinn.
- Staal.

123
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:36,600
I understand.

124
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:51,360
This violence is not approved.

125
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:58,600
- I killed him in Tuzla.
- Apparently not well enough.

126
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:01,680
I really dislike that man.

127
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:08,000
You must wear this at all times.
It's part pager, part timer.

128
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:12,600
It tells you where to be.
When it signals, you must respond.

129
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:23,920
We're a think-tank. We're linked
to every law enforcement database.

130
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:29,160
We analyse terrorist incidents
and advise our client governments.

131
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:33,240
We're the last line of defence
against global terrorism,

132
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:39,000
and no one knows we exist.
What's on the menu for today?

133
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:50,800
A Global Air 747 en route
from San Francisco to Seoul.

134
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:56,240
We are interpreting signals
from the crash site.

135
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:08,280
Headset on.
Hand on the scanner at all times.

136
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:22,120
We have a feed coming in
from Washington.

137
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:31,280
I have a statement from the
Secretary on the Global Air tragedy.

138
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,960
Of the 176 passengers on board,
there are no survivors.

139
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:41,680
The CIA reports that the plane was
deliberately downed by North Korea.

140
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:47,760
The Secretary will brief you later
regarding the U. S. response.

141
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:53,680
The Koreans deny responsibility, and
the President consults his allies.

142
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:05,520
Jack, your worth is in your ability
to analyse data in times of crisis.

143
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:10,240
This is the Colony's
reason to exist.

144
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:17,200
The plane exploded from
internal malfunction. It's gone.

145
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:25,000
We've intercepted the transmission
of Global 277's voice recorder.

146
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:29,400
We've got unscheduled traffic
at heading 329...

147
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:37,240
It's not a pleasant prospect,
the Koreans having that technology.

148
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:42,400
Anyone with an alternative?
Anyone?

149
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:49,480
Analysis confirms the report.
Moishe, do you buy it?

150
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,680
I'm not sure.

151
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:00,640
He's lying.
He's covering something up.

152
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:05,480
- They know something about it.
- Let's examine the images.

153
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,000
- Hold it.
- It's a shadow.

154
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:16,920
- Bingo. An AWACS.
- No, an F-4 Weasel.

155
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:23,840
- Include it in the simulation.
- It could've been hidden.

156
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,160
The Koreans pick up the F-4 on radar
but shoot down the passenger jet.

157
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:34,720
The U.S. used the jumbo as cover
for data recon on a weapons test.

158
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:41,200
They were set up so the Americans
could eavesdrop on a military base.

159
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,560
Nice call, Jack.

160
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:57,800
Underwater lasers.

161
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,000
One metre below the surface.
They destroy anything they contact.

162
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:06,840
If they don't get you,
the undertow will.

163
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:12,200
- No one ever escaped?
- No one.

164
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:17,720
A certain Bryce was the last to try.
Before the lasers were installed.

165
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:23,240
Poor fellow didn't survive 48 hours.
His "guardian" took care of him.

166
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:27,920
Each resident has a guardian,
without knowing who it is.

167
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:34,160
The guardian observes the resident's
attitude, behaviour and production.

168
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:38,400
If the resident escapes,
the guardian terminates him.

169
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:46,200
- How have you hidden this place?
- A masking device. We're invisible.

170
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:22,480
- Hello, Kathryn?
- Hello?

171
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:28,640
- I hope I'm not disturbing you.
- No...

172
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:33,680
This is Maria Trifioli
from the Galleria Luna in Rome.

173
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:41,920
We'd like to arrange an exhibition
of your sculptures. Surprised?

174
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:46,520
I'll send you a plane ticket
in the morning.

175
00:30:56,560 --> 00:31:01,680
You have five minutes
to check in at your cottages.

176
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:19,520
7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2...

177
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:26,400
Thank you, Mr. Quinn.
Please remain in contact.

178
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,840
The lasers are disengaged.

179
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:19,920
Hi, I'm Maria Trifioli.
I'm glad you accepted our offer.

180
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:24,840
I'm very flattered.
But it would be so difficult...

181
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:31,560
- You don't want to show your work?
- It's only four months since...

182
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:36,400
Perhaps this will open a new chapter
in your life.

183
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:41,720
The problem is moving to Rome.
It's so expensive...

184
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:48,800
Stay with us at the Regina. I'll see
that you and the baby are cared for.

185
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:56,080
Later you'll meet the gallery owner.
He's been waiting to meet you.

186
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:54,560
It's a typical Stavros operation,
and confirms our intelligence.

187
00:35:54,760 --> 00:36:02,960
But who is paying for his talents?
We anxiously await your analysis.

188
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:09,000
What's unusual, is that
no one's claimed responsibility.

189
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:14,640
Location: Barcelona. The Algerians
have flexed their muscles there.

190
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:19,640
They can't afford Stavros.
Maybe it's personal vengeance.

191
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:25,120
- Maybe Stavros is working alone.
- Why would he?

192
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:30,040
- Suppose it was a random act?
- Many groups are active in Spain.

193
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:40,240
- What do you think, Jack?
- No.

194
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:45,800
We await your comment.

195
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:53,920
It's not Stavros.
It's a copycat.

196
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:10,640
I also failed to get Stavros.
He's my last unpaid debt.

197
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:13,800
He's free, and I'm stuck here.

198
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:20,880
You were our last hope,
the last one good enough to get him.

199
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:28,520
- Does he know about this place?
- Maybe. That's why he's dangerous.

200
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:34,120
Agencies around the world
used him for difficult work.

201
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:38,240
When he was our ally, he was heroic.

202
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:43,600
Now he works for someone else, he's
a scalawag. He's out of fashion.

203
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:51,560
We've had to part with your swan.
I doubled the price.

204
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:58,800
My husband loved that swan.
He thought it was a cow.

205
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:49,040
You have five minutes
to check in at your cottages.

206
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:17,560
5, 4, 3, 2...

207
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:21,320
Thank you, Mr. Quinn.

208
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:07,560
- Let's go!
- The lasers are down!

209
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:50,480
I need help with the cable.
Give me some slack. Pull!

210
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:30,960
- Got a parachute?
- Yes!

211
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:12,480
Fasten your seat belts.
We'll be landing soon.

212
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,200
Who is his guardian?

213
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:50,960
- Boo!
- I heard they made you disappear.

214
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:56,040
- I need merchandise.
- Sorry, I'm closed for the night.

215
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:03,120
You're open now.

216
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,440
Let's talk.

217
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:20,000
- I need some mean toys.
- You'll be the bad boy in the hood.

218
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:28,480
Check this out. Laser sight.
Automatic. You'll need a holster.

219
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:32,720
- These are nice...
- Can you fly a plane?

220
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:40,200
Like a bird. But I stay on the
ground... Gas grenades are on sale.

221
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:48,400
You paying cash? I just declared
a seven-day cooling-off period.

222
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:54,640
- You know I'm good for it.
- Dead men don't get credit.

223
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:04,440
You get three CIA account numbers.
I get the stuff, you get the codes.

224
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:09,920
When I look at you,
I see nothing but trouble...

225
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:16,360
What the hell...
I like trouble.

226
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:23,880
- A parachute?
- This is better than a parachute.

227
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:31,640
- Are you sure this works?
- Of course.

228
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:36,640
I'm positive it works.

229
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:41,400
If you die, you get a full refund.

230
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:46,640
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

231
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:50,680
What are you doing?

232
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:09,480
- Give me a hand.
- How about a foot?

233
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:15,120
- Let's try something else.
- That's love, baby.

234
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:18,040
Watch your hands.

235
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:21,560
That's what I call hang time.

236
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:33,240
What's wrong with you?
You're crazier than my hairstylist!

237
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:38,880
- Did you test it?
- I didn't need to, I built it!

238
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:43,720
- Maybe I'll give you the codes.
- What do you mean "maybe"?

239
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,920
- Trust me.
- Bite me!

240
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:36,120
Yes, Kathryn. I'm coming.

241
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,520
Your baby's due tomorrow.

242
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:39,520
That's his heartbeat. Don't be late.
I wouldn't take this car.

243
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:46,080
I'm glad to see you can still play.
Check in to Hotel Navona in Rome.

244
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:49,400
Your baby's due tomorrow.

245
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:56,200
That's his heartbeat. Don't be late.
I wouldn't take this car.

246
00:51:56,360 --> 00:52:02,600
I'm glad to see you can still play.
Check in to Hotel Navona in Rome.

247
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:06,120
Your baby's due tomorrow.

248
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:10,320
That's his heartbeat...

249
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:17,960
Don't spoil the paint job.

250
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:21,320
Thanks.

251
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:27,720
I'm protecting my investment. But
this is too much. I want the codes.

252
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:35,200
- I need transportation to Rome.
- Transportation, you say?

253
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:38,560
I have some connections around here.

254
00:52:56,600 --> 00:53:02,400
If they can make it, I can steal it.
We'll blend in, in this.

255
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:06,880
So that's why you're dressed
like a carrot with earrings.

256
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:10,960
Damn bicycles.
Get out of the way!

257
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:15,200
I have them. They're on
the autostrada to Rome.

258
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:19,520
That checks with our information.
Quin's wife is at the Regina.

259
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:22,800
Splendid!
We've got a game going.

260
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:52,280
- Anything for Jack Quinn?
- Si, signore. Right here.

261
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:01,880
This was waiting for you, Quinn.

262
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:09,760
It's not a bomb.
Maybe it's the access codes.

263
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:15,000
- I'd love to get paid.
- Those accounts are fronts. Empty.

264
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:22,640
That figures. Why are you lying?
I bet the Colony doesn't even exist!

265
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:28,440
- It's not about the Colony.
- What the hell is this?

266
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:33,840
A sonogram of my son.
Stavros has my boy.

267
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:39,080
You go back to Antwerp.
I'll get your money. I pay my debts.

268
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:45,600
Quinn. Keep your money.

269
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:56,920
- Why didn't you tell me before?
- What for? You always play defence.

270
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:05,520
It's time to get off the bench.
The best defence is offence, right?

271
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:08,600
Right.

272
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:17,200
If we play by Stavros' rules,
my wife and son are dead.

273
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:21,960
If you send that e-mail, it'll be
intercepted by all the agencies.

274
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:26,920
- What's the plan?
- None. But Stavros doesn't know.

275
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:34,680
So he'll do what he thinks I would
do, and lead us right to Kathryn.

276
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:48,280
Quinn's clever.
A very sensitive man.

277
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:54,080
Another time, another place...
It's just too late.

278
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:06,480
You're going to hospital.
You'll be safer there.

279
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:23,560
Here, sir. Look.

280
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:32,320
It's a circus.
Everybody's here.

281
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:38,000
There's the Mossad.
Some local boys, on the corner.

282
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:44,600
Even the carabinieri.
Holy cow, it's a full house!

283
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:50,800
- Pardon me!
- Keep moving, buddy!

284
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:04,120
- It seems your plan isn't working.
- Patience. He'll be here.

285
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:08,400
- If we need help, I have a brother.
- You have a brother?

286
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:11,240
Yes. In the Sancumini Chapel.

287
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:44,440
Quinn, no!
That's what he wants.

288
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:49,200
Kathryn!

289
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:57,320
No!

290
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:14,200
You know something, Jack?
I never break a promise.

291
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:24,640
I promise I'll send you
an invitation to the christening.

292
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:32,520
- Think about wearing black.
- Let my wife go. Take me.

293
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:36,040
Actually,
I'm gonna take all three of you.

294
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:44,320
I got Stavros and Quinn!

295
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:12,720
Sniper on the roof!

296
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:25,040
- You're out of the game.
- You sure?

297
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:51,200
He's up...
He's in!

298
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:55,680
That was a five-pointer.

299
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:49,200
- Where is my wife?
- What are you talking about?

300
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:44,920
- Where's Jack?
- Don't worry, it'll be fine.

301
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:49,120
Who are you people?

302
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:15,640
Jack's coming. Take care of it.
He mustn't know what day it is.

303
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:36,520
Buonasera, Friar.
I'm looking for a guy named...

304
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:54,520
- What are these walls?
- The bones of my brothers.

305
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:59,880
You are a friend of Brother Yaz.
He has done us many favours.

306
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:04,640
Including a mainframe
you wouldn't believe.

307
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:15,960
- What's up?
- What's up?

308
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:22,920
This is Brother Regulo and Brother
Ramulo. This is Brother Quinn.

309
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:35,400
The monks have gathered information
on Rome for 500 years. Cybermonks!

310
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:39,680
That prescription label you found?
He's tracing it.

311
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:51,840
Internet...

312
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:57,120
27 doctors prescribed that
medication in the last few days.

313
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:03,120
- It's an outside signal.
- Is it going to crash?

314
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:07,760
Where in heaven did that come from?

315
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:21,760
May I?

316
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:27,760
Incoming message.

317
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:32,000
"Thanks for the blessing. Jack".

318
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:44,480
He's down here somewhere.

319
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:51,200
Man, these antiques
are worth a fortune!

320
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:55,640
In a spiritual sense.

321
01:07:55,800 --> 01:08:01,720
We are now under the Tiber River,
going towards the Island of Tiberi.

322
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:07,360
- Under the bridge to the hospital.
- That's where Stavros' men will be?

323
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:15,040
- Good luck!
- Thank you, brothers.

324
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:18,560
- Catch you on the Internet!
- I'll wait for your e-mail.

325
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:26,080
Okay, push!
Like that! Push!

326
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:32,040
- It's stuck! But I have something.
- What do you have?

327
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:41,720
- What's that?
- My lucky coin, my lucky detonator.

328
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:48,800
- Semtex.
- That's it. Handier than duck tape.

329
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:53,640
Preparation, my friend!
You've got to have the right tools.

330
01:08:54,960 --> 01:09:00,240
- Damn, not enough wire!
- Preparation, huh?

331
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:03,000
Hold on.

332
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:06,600
let's find a rock.

333
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:13,000
You don't mind, do you?
It's for a good cause.

334
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:20,320
- Oops, airball!
- You need practice, man.

335
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:24,440
I hate practice.
But I never miss twice, brother.

336
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:41,960
My baby!

337
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:07,520
- He's on the island.
- Of course he is.

338
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:13,240
I need time. Give me 60 seconds.
Then kill both the women.

339
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:24,080
Up there.

340
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:32,320
Go, go, go!

341
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:37,680
Be careful.
You'll wind up in the hospital.

342
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:44,920
Did you hear something?
Up there!

343
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:46,640
- It's me! It's me.
- It's you, it's you.

344
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:55,720
This hospital is awfully quiet.

345
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:07,880
You take care of it.

346
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:13,240
They're over here...
Go!

347
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:17,360
What are you doing just standing..?

348
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:21,040
It's a hospital.
No running, please.

349
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:31,360
Quiet.

350
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:39,200
Let me help you down.

351
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:12,160
Jack?

352
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:20,840
What's going on?

353
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:28,280
No, Jack. She saved me.

354
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:43,720
- They said you were dead.
- It's okay. I'm here.

355
01:13:48,280 --> 01:13:51,960
Stavros... Where is he?

356
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:58,920
Where's our son?

357
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:09,680
- Where's my son?
- I know where they are.

358
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:15,720
You go get your boy.
I'll take care of her.

359
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:20,640
- Thank you.
- You owe me.

360
01:14:57,320 --> 01:15:00,920
Get rid of it, or the party's over.

361
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:12,120
You know, Jack...
I can call you Jack, can't I?

362
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:18,960
I bet there's not a night you can
close your eyes tight enough,

363
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:23,720
without seeing
my little boy's face.

364
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:27,240
I'll give you a chance
to save your son.

365
01:15:28,520 --> 01:15:32,920
If you live,
you'll get to know your son.

366
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:38,600
And if you don't,
I'll raise him as my own.

367
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:45,080
Men are strong, Jack.
But the tiger is stronger.

368
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:54,120
Watch your step, Jack.

369
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:59,640
It's okay to step on a mine,
it's stepping off that counts.

370
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:22,360
Quinn!

371
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:26,760
Where did he come from?

372
01:16:27,480 --> 01:16:31,560
Yaz!
The crosses, they're mines.

373
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:41,800
Don't go off and party without me.
I'll be back.

374
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:09,680
Got you!

375
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:08,320
Jack!

376
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:18,680
The baby's safe.
Let's get the hell out.

377
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:23,280
You take care of my son.
I'll take care of Stavros.

378
01:20:51,960 --> 01:20:58,640
Lift your foot, my tall friend, and
that mine'll turn you to red paint.

379
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:53,160
You've got big feet, Mr. Quinn.
Be careful where you put them.

380
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:17,360
Looks like you're the bitch now,
Stavros. I forgot to tell you...

381
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:23,360
You went to a lot of trouble
digging holes, putting up markers.

382
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:29,600
But I moved a couple of crosses.
Sorry!

383
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:33,880
Yaz, behind you!

384
01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:52,040
- Where's my son?
- I'm looking! He was right here.

385
01:23:53,160 --> 01:23:56,000
Is everybody okay?

386
01:24:07,160 --> 01:24:11,120
It's me... Daddy.

387
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:38,160
I want to remember
my Roman holiday.

388
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:44,080
Give me a souvenir.

389
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:49,760
Cut a piece of your hair.
And your shirt.

390
01:24:56,840 --> 01:25:00,800
Quinn, you may like this.
A souvenir from me.

391
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:06,680
Maybe my coin will
be lucky for you, too.

392
01:25:19,960 --> 01:25:24,200
I'm not giving you any of
my hair, Mr. Goldsmythe.

393
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:28,840
You are a magician, Mr. Yaz.

394
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:37,680
Now it's my turn to disappear.

395
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:51,000
They'll blame me for this.
I wonder what the fine will be?
