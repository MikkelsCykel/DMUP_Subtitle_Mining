1
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:32,721
Here, Charlie. More fortune cookies.

2
00:01:32,808 --> 00:01:34,561
- Good luck!
- Thanks! What?

3
00:01:34,649 --> 00:01:39,278
Next week, we'll be selling
Sanyo remote control VCRs for $299!

4
00:01:39,368 --> 00:01:41,837
- Look, it's Dad!
- Oh, no! I'll go broke!

5
00:01:42,049 --> 00:01:47,076
To give away Mitsubishi
giant-screen television sets for $1,299!

6
00:01:47,248 --> 00:01:48,840
Oh, no!

7
00:01:48,929 --> 00:01:53,956
We won't be undersold on microwaves,
videorecorders, ovens...

8
00:01:54,129 --> 00:01:57,325
- Mom, you're not looking.
- Please turn that off.

9
00:01:57,849 --> 00:02:00,203
Mom, when are you going to stop
being mad at Dad?

10
00:02:00,289 --> 00:02:02,722
I mean, how do you think
that makes me feel?

11
00:02:02,808 --> 00:02:05,801
I have certain unresolved feelings
about your father.

12
00:02:06,168 --> 00:02:07,567
I don't trust him.

13
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:11,485
- And I hate those commercials.
- All right, forget it.

14
00:02:11,568 --> 00:02:13,639
We don't have time
for another heart-to-heart.

15
00:02:13,729 --> 00:02:15,401
Come on. You have to get dressed.

16
00:02:18,968 --> 00:02:22,405
- I want you to understand it's insulting...
- Watch your hair.

17
00:02:23,049 --> 00:02:27,326
...for him to go from me to that bimbo.
Do you think he really loves Janet?

18
00:02:28,088 --> 00:02:30,318
Maybe he's just smashed
too many fortune cookies!

19
00:02:30,408 --> 00:02:33,287
Mom, give me a break!
He's missing the reunion because of you.

20
00:02:33,368 --> 00:02:35,086
You know he's dying to go.

21
00:02:35,769 --> 00:02:38,329
At least we won't both have
a miserable time.

22
00:02:40,848 --> 00:02:42,168
Let me see.

23
00:02:42,568 --> 00:02:44,206
What do you think?

24
00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:46,319
You are a very hip chick!

25
00:02:46,769 --> 00:02:49,966
God, you look like you've stepped
right out of Life magazine!

26
00:02:50,248 --> 00:02:51,283
I don't know.

27
00:02:51,368 --> 00:02:53,836
What if nobody else there
is dressed like this?

28
00:02:53,929 --> 00:02:54,963
So?

29
00:02:55,769 --> 00:02:57,441
- I don't think I wanna go.
- Mom.

30
00:02:57,528 --> 00:03:01,044
Everybody's just gonna say,
"Well, hey, where's Crazy Charlie?"

31
00:03:01,808 --> 00:03:04,368
Lots of people are separated and divorced.

32
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:07,998
Not from the guy
with the lowest prices in town.

33
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:12,002
I feel ridiculous in this dress!
I'd like to change.

34
00:03:12,088 --> 00:03:14,158
Why are you so nervous?
What's the matter?

35
00:03:14,248 --> 00:03:16,399
Reunions do funny things
to people at this age.

36
00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:18,639
- Hi, Peggy Sue! Beth!
- Hi.

37
00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:20,837
Hi, Maddy.

38
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:22,437
How are you?

39
00:03:22,528 --> 00:03:24,485
You two look
just like that soap commercial.

40
00:03:24,568 --> 00:03:27,800
- "Which one's the mother?"
- "And which one's the daughter?"

41
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:32,598
You took this seriously.
You're a real blast from the past!

42
00:03:33,049 --> 00:03:34,687
It was Beth's idea.

43
00:03:34,808 --> 00:03:38,085
I wish I had the nerve. And the figure.

44
00:03:38,329 --> 00:03:41,002
- Hi.
- Hi! Peggy Sue Bodell?

45
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:43,125
- All right.
- Mom?

46
00:03:43,609 --> 00:03:45,360
Beth's boyfriend is with the band.

47
00:03:45,449 --> 00:03:47,439
- Must run in the family.
- What does?

48
00:03:47,528 --> 00:03:50,680
You and your mother.
You both seem to fall for musicians.

49
00:04:00,889 --> 00:04:02,207
Mom, look!

50
00:04:03,128 --> 00:04:04,402
Oh, God!

51
00:04:05,528 --> 00:04:08,680
It's okay. Come on. Look!

52
00:04:11,008 --> 00:04:13,842
Why don't you find a table?
We'll see you in a little while.

53
00:04:13,929 --> 00:04:14,918
Sure.

54
00:04:15,329 --> 00:04:19,641
God, Mom, that picture's great!
Come on, let's get a table.

55
00:04:33,569 --> 00:04:35,240
- Is this good?
- Fine.

56
00:04:35,329 --> 00:04:38,161
- I'll be right back. You be all right?
- Sure.

57
00:04:38,249 --> 00:04:41,321
Thank you. We're gonna do
a little medley for you now.

58
00:04:45,649 --> 00:04:49,163
- Come on, pose like your picture.
- What?

59
00:04:52,329 --> 00:04:54,319
Hi, do you like it?

60
00:04:54,408 --> 00:04:57,958
I figured as everyone has a gold Rolex,
I'd have one made in platinum.

61
00:04:58,048 --> 00:05:00,608
- What a wonderful idea!
- How are you?

62
00:05:00,689 --> 00:05:02,838
I'm fine. How many children do you have?

63
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:05,283
- I don't have any.
- You don't? I thought you did.

64
00:05:05,369 --> 00:05:07,485
- No. How many do you have?
- I have four.

65
00:05:07,569 --> 00:05:08,718
- Four?
- Four, yeah.

66
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,083
I'm so happy for you.

67
00:05:10,168 --> 00:05:12,204
- I love them so much.
- How's Peggy Sue doing?

68
00:05:12,288 --> 00:05:14,199
She was a mess,
right after they separated.

69
00:05:14,288 --> 00:05:17,247
But I think she's coming out of it.
Seems to be friendly now.

70
00:05:17,329 --> 00:05:18,523
I'm so glad.

71
00:05:19,288 --> 00:05:21,279
Sometimes it's easier when you hate them.

72
00:05:21,649 --> 00:05:24,721
- How about a little dance, princess?
- Walter!

73
00:05:25,728 --> 00:05:27,764
- How are you?
- Good.

74
00:05:28,168 --> 00:05:30,728
- Nice to see you. I'll see you later.
- Yeah.

75
00:05:31,649 --> 00:05:33,685
Aren't you Peggy Sue Kelcher?

76
00:05:33,769 --> 00:05:38,524
I was once. Richard Norvik?

77
00:05:40,488 --> 00:05:42,240
I didn't recognise you!

78
00:05:42,329 --> 00:05:45,206
You look terrific.
You look exactly the same.

79
00:05:45,288 --> 00:05:48,122
I feel ridiculous!
I only did this for tonight, you know.

80
00:05:48,209 --> 00:05:50,120
- It's adorable.
- Thank you.

81
00:05:50,209 --> 00:05:52,927
Peggy Sue Kelcher, this is my wife, Sharon.

82
00:05:53,009 --> 00:05:56,718
- How nice to meet you. Why don't you sit?
- Thank you.

83
00:05:56,809 --> 00:05:59,528
But call me Peggy. Peggy Bodell now.

84
00:06:00,249 --> 00:06:02,319
So, where's Charlie?

85
00:06:02,769 --> 00:06:07,240
I was in town about a year ago
and I turn on the television...

86
00:06:07,329 --> 00:06:10,081
...and I see Crazy Charlie.

87
00:06:10,689 --> 00:06:12,485
It really made me laugh.

88
00:06:13,249 --> 00:06:15,319
Charlie won't be here tonight.

89
00:06:17,408 --> 00:06:21,959
- We're getting divorced, actually.
- I'm sorry to hear that.

90
00:06:22,209 --> 00:06:24,927
Mr. Norvik!

91
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:27,728
Richard. Doug Snell, Merrill Lynch.

92
00:06:28,728 --> 00:06:32,562
I read about that Codex deal
in Business Week. Congratulations!

93
00:06:33,088 --> 00:06:35,125
Thank you very much.

94
00:06:35,369 --> 00:06:39,442
Peggy, how are you? How's Charlie?
Hey, Terry!

95
00:06:39,689 --> 00:06:42,202
- Thank you, Doug, thank you very much.
- Call me.

96
00:06:42,528 --> 00:06:45,805
Madeline Hutton and Arthur Nagle
were high school sweethearts.

97
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:49,086
Married right after graduation,
they're still together.

98
00:06:49,249 --> 00:06:54,322
Maddy. Arthur. How does it feel
to have missed the sexual revolution?

99
00:06:54,649 --> 00:06:57,004
What? What kind of question is that?

100
00:06:57,088 --> 00:06:59,887
That doesn't have anything to do
with the reunion, Delores!

101
00:06:59,968 --> 00:07:01,197
Take it easy, kitten.

102
00:07:03,369 --> 00:07:06,805
- Welcome to the singles scene.
- I don't know how you do it.

103
00:07:07,488 --> 00:07:09,956
I've never even dated anybody but Charlie.

104
00:07:10,689 --> 00:07:12,360
It's not that bad, really.

105
00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:16,487
You just have to think of men like houses,
and trade upward.

106
00:07:19,129 --> 00:07:23,122
I always thought that you and Charlie
had a really great marriage.

107
00:07:23,809 --> 00:07:25,127
I think we did.

108
00:07:26,209 --> 00:07:27,800
We just got married too young...

109
00:07:27,889 --> 00:07:31,358
...and ended up blaming each other
for all the things we missed.

110
00:07:31,569 --> 00:07:35,403
So he started having affairs
and you started getting depressed?

111
00:07:37,608 --> 00:07:40,567
You just should have left here years ago,
like I did.

112
00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:42,288
It's not so bad.

113
00:07:42,848 --> 00:07:46,158
I've got two great kids.
I've got my own business.

114
00:07:48,088 --> 00:07:52,081
Still, if I knew then what I know now...

115
00:07:53,408 --> 00:07:55,684
...l'd do a lot of things differently.

116
00:07:56,288 --> 00:07:58,927
Your damn computers
put me out of business.

117
00:07:59,048 --> 00:08:00,163
You're right. He's drunk.

118
00:08:00,249 --> 00:08:02,557
You're a billionaire
and I'm a goddamn failure.

119
00:08:03,288 --> 00:08:05,086
No, the bakery's doing very well.

120
00:08:05,168 --> 00:08:08,161
- Do you manage it?
- I own it.

121
00:08:08,728 --> 00:08:10,401
I remember that dress.

122
00:08:12,968 --> 00:08:14,482
Rosalie?

123
00:08:16,088 --> 00:08:19,286
Oh, no. I remember that locket, too.

124
00:08:19,728 --> 00:08:23,721
You were so excited!
I think you showed it to the whole school.

125
00:08:23,809 --> 00:08:25,367
You have an incredible memory.

126
00:08:25,449 --> 00:08:28,406
- It's beautiful. Does it open?
- Yes.

127
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:33,166
- These are my children.
- They're so cute!

128
00:08:33,249 --> 00:08:35,284
Of course, they're not babies anymore!

129
00:08:35,369 --> 00:08:38,087
But you were married
when you were three, right?

130
00:08:38,808 --> 00:08:40,400
God bless you!

131
00:08:45,448 --> 00:08:47,678
The best thing about being a dentist.

132
00:08:48,089 --> 00:08:49,807
Pure pharmaceutical grade.

133
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:53,280
A couple of lines of this,
I could drill my own teeth.

134
00:08:58,168 --> 00:08:59,203
Hi.

135
00:09:01,129 --> 00:09:02,118
Hi.

136
00:09:09,129 --> 00:09:12,166
- Who's the guy with the eyes?
- Michael Fitzsimmons.

137
00:09:12,649 --> 00:09:14,957
I used to have
such a crush on him in school.

138
00:09:15,048 --> 00:09:16,721
- Peggy.
- Hi!

139
00:09:16,849 --> 00:09:19,124
God, that Walter Getz can still dance!

140
00:09:20,489 --> 00:09:24,277
Your first boyfriend!
Come on, tell me. Any sparks left?

141
00:09:24,369 --> 00:09:25,768
Well, who knows?

142
00:09:25,849 --> 00:09:28,841
I mean, remember,
whatever Walter wants...

143
00:09:28,928 --> 00:09:30,965
...Walter gets!

144
00:09:34,089 --> 00:09:35,841
I'm sorry. Sharon Norvik.

145
00:09:36,249 --> 00:09:40,400
This is Carol Heath and Maddy Nagle,
my oldest and my dearest friends.

146
00:09:40,489 --> 00:09:42,878
- Nice to meet you.
- Sharon is married to Richard.

147
00:09:42,969 --> 00:09:44,527
- Lucky lady!
- Thank you.

148
00:09:44,609 --> 00:09:46,918
Michael Fitzsimmons. Is he here?

149
00:09:47,448 --> 00:09:50,407
No. No, I asked Rosalie.
She couldn't track him down.

150
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:53,322
- That's too bad.
- He must have been quite a guy.

151
00:09:53,408 --> 00:09:54,318
Yeah.

152
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:59,322
You know, he is the only boy in high school
I wish I'd gone to bed with!

153
00:09:59,408 --> 00:10:00,682
Only one?

154
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:03,798
Well, besides Charlie.

155
00:10:09,369 --> 00:10:11,279
I hope the sales of your book go very well.

156
00:10:11,369 --> 00:10:13,438
Anything anecdotal
you'd like to leave us with?

157
00:10:13,528 --> 00:10:15,565
Yeah, every dog has its day.

158
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:16,798
Meaning what?

159
00:10:16,889 --> 00:10:21,041
Peggy, would you please rescue Richard?
Ask him to dance.

160
00:10:21,129 --> 00:10:23,722
Richard. Would you like to dance?

161
00:10:23,808 --> 00:10:26,277
Of course I would.
So, are we through now?

162
00:10:26,369 --> 00:10:27,484
- No.
- Good.

163
00:10:28,729 --> 00:10:30,798
From snivelling runt
to pompous ass in 25 years.

164
00:10:30,889 --> 00:10:32,606
That's quite an accomplishment.

165
00:10:39,328 --> 00:10:41,558
I really cannot get over this.

166
00:10:41,928 --> 00:10:45,477
The only time people like Delores Dodge
used to pay any attention to me...

167
00:10:45,568 --> 00:10:48,447
...was to laugh at me or insult me.

168
00:10:48,528 --> 00:10:50,360
- You know that guy Doug Snell?
- Yeah.

169
00:10:50,448 --> 00:10:52,837
He shook my hand
when we walked in here?

170
00:10:52,928 --> 00:10:55,044
He used to call me, "Four-eyed worm."

171
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:58,120
You showed them all.

172
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:00,881
You're rich and famous and successful...

173
00:11:02,249 --> 00:11:04,205
...and you have a beautiful wife.

174
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:07,964
You were always friendly to me.
I appreciated that.

175
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:31,767
It's Crazy Charlie, the appliance king!

176
00:11:32,009 --> 00:11:33,760
Hey, Charlie!

177
00:11:35,649 --> 00:11:38,640
Look at you! You're putting on
a little weight, man!

178
00:11:38,889 --> 00:11:40,845
You look great. Great.

179
00:11:41,408 --> 00:11:45,721
So, this is the reunion? It's wonderful.

180
00:11:45,808 --> 00:11:47,037
Like, wonderful!

181
00:11:47,129 --> 00:11:50,201
Are you and Peggy still talking?
I mean, is it amicable?

182
00:11:50,288 --> 00:11:52,404
She hasn't changed at all, Charlie.

183
00:11:52,568 --> 00:11:55,561
- Your daughter's a real doll.
- "Why, I oughta..."

184
00:12:18,729 --> 00:12:19,717
Hello.

185
00:12:22,568 --> 00:12:24,321
Hello!

186
00:12:24,969 --> 00:12:29,246
Can I have your attention, please?
Listen up! Can I have your attention?

187
00:12:29,408 --> 00:12:31,923
I know everybody's having a great time...

188
00:12:32,048 --> 00:12:36,246
...but now, you have to get ready for
that moment you've all been waiting for.

189
00:12:39,688 --> 00:12:41,441
Dad? Hi.

190
00:12:44,849 --> 00:12:48,443
The Reunion Committee has selected
a king and a queen.

191
00:12:55,928 --> 00:12:57,282
Let's get back to business.

192
00:12:57,369 --> 00:13:00,360
The Reunion Committee
has given this a lot of thought...

193
00:13:00,448 --> 00:13:04,488
...and decided on two people
who best represent the spirit...

194
00:13:04,568 --> 00:13:07,402
...of Buchanan High's Class of '60!

195
00:13:08,089 --> 00:13:09,567
What are you doing?

196
00:13:09,649 --> 00:13:12,640
The king is someone who,
in more ways than one...

197
00:13:12,729 --> 00:13:15,687
...has come a long way since he left here...

198
00:13:15,769 --> 00:13:18,919
...and we are especially proud
to welcome him back.

199
00:13:19,249 --> 00:13:22,081
Richard Norvik!
Come on up here, King Richard!

200
00:13:37,769 --> 00:13:39,804
I demand a recount!

201
00:13:42,969 --> 00:13:44,481
That's gotta be Getz!

202
00:13:45,448 --> 00:13:47,565
First you gotta learn how to count.

203
00:13:50,089 --> 00:13:52,239
Hold me back!

204
00:13:54,568 --> 00:13:56,684
Well, I just want to say thank you.

205
00:13:57,328 --> 00:14:01,799
Sharon and I feel real welcome.
We're having a great time.

206
00:14:02,528 --> 00:14:05,168
Boy, our high school
looks really good from up here.

207
00:14:05,249 --> 00:14:09,162
And I just wanna say, it's good to be back.
Thanks a lot.

208
00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:20,163
- Now, every king deserves a queen.
- Over here!

209
00:14:20,688 --> 00:14:22,360
Not you, Getz!

210
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:24,327
Life of the party!

211
00:14:25,089 --> 00:14:27,080
But when we sent out the invitations...

212
00:14:27,168 --> 00:14:30,285
...we didn't mention anything about
this being a costume party...

213
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,006
...and perhaps we should've...

214
00:14:32,089 --> 00:14:34,886
...because just looking at her
brings it all back!

215
00:14:34,969 --> 00:14:37,607
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you our queen...

216
00:14:37,688 --> 00:14:41,807
...Peggy Sue Kelcher Bodell!
Come on up here, Peggy Sue!

217
00:14:42,369 --> 00:14:44,599
I can't. I can't do it.

218
00:14:44,808 --> 00:14:46,162
Yes, you can.

219
00:14:46,448 --> 00:14:50,806
Go on, you can do it. Go on.
You can do it.

220
00:15:17,568 --> 00:15:18,888
Congratulations.

221
00:15:27,328 --> 00:15:29,604
Thank you, thank you very much.

222
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:10,238
Mom!

223
00:16:33,369 --> 00:16:35,599
Now, hold your arm up.

224
00:16:36,769 --> 00:16:38,759
Would you like your Twinkie now?

225
00:16:53,609 --> 00:16:54,758
Charlie?

226
00:16:57,089 --> 00:16:59,080
I want to suck your blood!

227
00:17:00,408 --> 00:17:02,524
I also want to suck your Twinkie!

228
00:17:03,009 --> 00:17:06,240
- Am I dead?
- No. You are the undead.

229
00:17:08,808 --> 00:17:11,084
Let's have it. You hate them, anyway.

230
00:17:11,449 --> 00:17:14,406
Young man! You stop that!

231
00:17:14,568 --> 00:17:18,448
Hey, I just made a deposit in your bank.
Now I want to make a withdrawal.

232
00:17:18,528 --> 00:17:20,804
I think it's time for your next class.

233
00:17:21,169 --> 00:17:24,844
- Go on! All of you!
- I'm a little worried about the side effects.

234
00:17:26,568 --> 00:17:28,525
Now, you lie back down.

235
00:17:31,929 --> 00:17:33,248
What am I doing here?

236
00:17:33,328 --> 00:17:36,401
You passed out for a minute, that's all.
Nothing to worry about.

237
00:17:36,489 --> 00:17:40,925
- But how did I get here?
- Why don't you let your friends help you?

238
00:17:41,048 --> 00:17:45,565
Take her into the washroom
and splash some cold water on her face...

239
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:48,367
...and that should perk her up.
- Yes, ma'am.

240
00:17:48,528 --> 00:17:49,928
How are you doing?

241
00:17:53,648 --> 00:17:56,721
Blood drive? 1960?

242
00:18:00,888 --> 00:18:01,958
Wanna smoke?

243
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:04,438
No, Carol. That's the worst thing for her.

244
00:18:04,528 --> 00:18:06,247
I gave them up years ago.

245
00:18:08,648 --> 00:18:11,242
- Where is it?
- Where's what?

246
00:18:13,409 --> 00:18:15,479
Maddy, what did you do to your hair?

247
00:18:17,328 --> 00:18:19,365
I'm taking you back to the nurse.

248
00:18:23,848 --> 00:18:27,318
- Delores, why aren't you giving blood?
- I can't. I'm too anaemic.

249
00:18:27,409 --> 00:18:29,604
Maybe you should drink
some of that nail polish.

250
00:18:29,689 --> 00:18:30,804
It might give you strength.

251
00:18:30,888 --> 00:18:33,198
Why don't you come back
and show me how?

252
00:18:40,608 --> 00:18:42,326
We're going to take you home now.

253
00:18:42,409 --> 00:18:45,401
That's okay.
I'm sure I can remember the way.

254
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:53,402
Steady now.

255
00:18:55,288 --> 00:18:57,007
People get weak when they give blood.

256
00:19:19,808 --> 00:19:21,640
It's wonderful Spring Radio.

257
00:19:21,729 --> 00:19:26,007
At 1280 on your AM dial,
here's more from our golden survey.

258
00:19:28,769 --> 00:19:32,125
And now from The Champs,
let's party with a little Tequila.

259
00:19:56,929 --> 00:20:00,443
- I'll call you later.
- Yes! Let's keep in touch.

260
00:20:36,209 --> 00:20:37,528
Who is it?

261
00:20:38,328 --> 00:20:41,162
Peggy. Peggy Sue.

262
00:20:41,689 --> 00:20:44,521
Come on in. I left the door open for you.

263
00:20:59,449 --> 00:21:02,042
The nurse called
and said you'd be coming home.

264
00:21:02,209 --> 00:21:03,561
I have a note.

265
00:21:05,608 --> 00:21:09,363
- How do you feel?
- I was excused.

266
00:21:09,888 --> 00:21:12,642
Why don't you go upstairs
and lie down for a while?

267
00:21:14,088 --> 00:21:15,965
Oh, Mom!

268
00:21:17,769 --> 00:21:21,557
Chanel No. 5.
It always reminds me of home.

269
00:21:21,648 --> 00:21:24,083
Of course, dear. You're home now.

270
00:21:26,288 --> 00:21:29,804
- You sure you're going to be all right?
- Yeah.

271
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:23,039
What is going on?

272
00:22:28,648 --> 00:22:29,637
Nancy?

273
00:22:30,689 --> 00:22:32,599
It's Nancy!

274
00:22:35,409 --> 00:22:37,763
My baby sister!

275
00:22:43,808 --> 00:22:47,563
- I'm so happy to see you!
- What are you doing?

276
00:22:48,088 --> 00:22:51,479
Mom said you were sick.
You're never happy to see me.

277
00:22:51,568 --> 00:22:54,527
I'm sorry! I'm sorry about that.

278
00:22:55,368 --> 00:22:57,200
I want us to be closer.

279
00:22:57,409 --> 00:23:00,526
I have too many unresolved relationships
in my life.

280
00:23:01,169 --> 00:23:04,047
Teenagers are weird.
And you're the weirdest.

281
00:23:07,368 --> 00:23:09,519
You wanna play a game?

282
00:23:09,689 --> 00:23:11,041
Come here.

283
00:23:12,648 --> 00:23:15,209
How about Monopoly?

284
00:23:15,288 --> 00:23:19,839
Or Parcheesi. Or Chutes and Ladders?

285
00:23:20,769 --> 00:23:22,963
I have a question.
Let me turn the tables on you.

286
00:23:23,048 --> 00:23:24,528
Maybe you, down here, don't know.

287
00:23:24,608 --> 00:23:28,284
Is there anybody in the house knows
where Dion and the Belmonts are?

288
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:32,567
I don't believe it.
Look at that man. He never ages.

289
00:23:32,808 --> 00:23:34,845
Isn't Kenny Rossi dreamy?

290
00:23:35,368 --> 00:23:38,805
I wish he'd break up with Arlene.
She thinks she's so great.

291
00:23:39,689 --> 00:23:42,806
- Don't eat any of the red ones.
- Why not?

292
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:47,883
They're bad for you.
They give you red lips.

293
00:24:09,848 --> 00:24:12,363
What the hell? I'm probably dead anyway.

294
00:24:12,568 --> 00:24:15,799
Peggy Sue, get in here!
Dion's almost over.

295
00:24:25,048 --> 00:24:28,564
I left your laundry on your beds, girls.
Don't forget to put it away, okay?

296
00:24:28,648 --> 00:24:29,876
What's for dinner?

297
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:32,038
Creamed chipped beef on toast
with rutabagas.

298
00:24:32,128 --> 00:24:33,846
Your father's favourite.

299
00:24:34,088 --> 00:24:36,045
Not again!

300
00:24:36,568 --> 00:24:39,208
Evelyn! Girls?
What is this out on the street?

301
00:24:39,808 --> 00:24:41,878
Come and take a look!
Who left this out here?

302
00:24:41,969 --> 00:24:44,881
- What is it, dear?
- Come on out and see for yourself!

303
00:24:44,969 --> 00:24:46,321
Don't yell. Stop shouting.

304
00:24:50,608 --> 00:24:52,122
It's cool!

305
00:24:55,209 --> 00:24:57,483
- Dad!
- Wait until I tell Diane.

306
00:24:57,568 --> 00:25:00,128
She's always bragging
about her dad's Cadillac.

307
00:25:00,209 --> 00:25:01,961
What do you think, Peggy Sue?

308
00:25:02,048 --> 00:25:07,042
Oh, Dad! You were always doing
stuff like that! It's funny.

309
00:25:07,288 --> 00:25:11,601
It's really funny. You bought an Edsel.

310
00:25:13,808 --> 00:25:16,084
Young lady, what's the matter with you?

311
00:25:17,009 --> 00:25:18,202
Are you drunk?

312
00:25:20,409 --> 00:25:23,765
Just a little. I had a tough day.

313
00:25:27,288 --> 00:25:29,483
No, don't wear it out, Nancy!

314
00:25:30,449 --> 00:25:33,599
We can't afford a new car.
Do we have to take it back?

315
00:25:34,288 --> 00:25:37,598
I fail to see the humour of this!
Go to your room, you're grounded!

316
00:25:37,689 --> 00:25:40,282
- Grounded?
- Put that down!

317
00:25:40,808 --> 00:25:43,481
That's the story of my life! I'm an adult.

318
00:25:43,608 --> 00:25:46,123
I'm going to go to Liverpool
and discover The Beatles.

319
00:25:46,209 --> 00:25:49,041
Jack, take it easy!
She gave blood at school today.

320
00:25:49,128 --> 00:25:53,041
- She's a little lightheaded.
- This is not giving blood! This is drunk!

321
00:25:54,009 --> 00:25:56,886
Dad, I never knew you had
a sense of humour.

322
00:25:57,009 --> 00:25:59,647
- Evelyn, put her to bed!
- Come on, Mom!

323
00:25:59,769 --> 00:26:01,963
You're making a mountain
out of a molehill.

324
00:26:02,048 --> 00:26:03,561
A tempest in a teapot!

325
00:26:05,528 --> 00:26:07,086
My little baby.

326
00:26:13,449 --> 00:26:15,359
Don't try to grow up so fast.

327
00:26:17,528 --> 00:26:19,837
Mom, I forgot you were ever this young.

328
00:26:20,929 --> 00:26:22,327
Sleep, baby.

329
00:26:46,969 --> 00:26:48,084
Good morning.

330
00:26:48,169 --> 00:26:52,480
What happened to your hair, Peggy?
You have such a pretty face.

331
00:26:52,689 --> 00:26:55,920
- Why are you always trying to cover it up?
- I forgot.

332
00:26:56,489 --> 00:26:58,047
- 'Morning.
- 'Morning.

333
00:26:58,769 --> 00:26:59,837
Excuse me.

334
00:26:59,929 --> 00:27:02,886
Nancy, put your homework down
and sit down.

335
00:27:04,489 --> 00:27:06,719
You're looking bright and chipper
this morning.

336
00:27:06,808 --> 00:27:10,118
I'm still here.
I thought I might as well enjoy myself.

337
00:27:10,209 --> 00:27:12,200
I think I'll go to school today.

338
00:27:12,848 --> 00:27:15,965
You know, Dad, I'm sorry about yesterday.

339
00:27:16,929 --> 00:27:20,365
The Edsel is a classic.
Use it in the best of health.

340
00:27:20,449 --> 00:27:21,768
Well, thank you.

341
00:27:21,969 --> 00:27:24,801
But don't ever let anything
like that happen again.

342
00:27:24,888 --> 00:27:28,006
You're far too young
to start acquiring bad habits.

343
00:27:28,409 --> 00:27:30,479
I agree. You know, Mom and Dad...

344
00:27:31,368 --> 00:27:34,759
...you are the best parents
a girl could ever have.

345
00:27:35,689 --> 00:27:37,963
I'm really gonna try and behave myself.

346
00:27:38,249 --> 00:27:39,728
Sure you will!

347
00:27:42,009 --> 00:27:43,646
Come on, Momma, sit down.

348
00:27:44,568 --> 00:27:46,082
You want me to sit?

349
00:27:46,568 --> 00:27:50,198
I mean, isn't this great?
Just all of us here together!

350
00:27:54,368 --> 00:27:56,836
Can I tell Charlie
Peggy Sue got drunk last night?

351
00:27:56,929 --> 00:27:58,044
Young lady!

352
00:27:59,249 --> 00:28:02,161
I forgot about him. What am I gonna do?

353
00:28:02,328 --> 00:28:04,923
- Did you two have a fight?
- Sort of.

354
00:28:05,009 --> 00:28:06,806
- About what?
- House payments.

355
00:28:11,848 --> 00:28:12,998
Baby!

356
00:28:14,169 --> 00:28:15,488
How do you feel?

357
00:28:16,288 --> 00:28:17,801
Pretty strange.

358
00:28:18,489 --> 00:28:21,162
Come on. Get in. I can take care of that.

359
00:28:25,288 --> 00:28:26,688
I have a headache.

360
00:28:28,568 --> 00:28:30,126
Headache?

361
00:28:35,888 --> 00:28:37,527
You drive like a maniac!

362
00:28:40,409 --> 00:28:42,319
It's not that I'm glad you were sick...

363
00:28:42,409 --> 00:28:46,163
...but it just gave me a chance
to do some thinking last night.

364
00:28:46,249 --> 00:28:50,560
- Yeah?
- Yeah. About what we said on Tuesday.

365
00:28:51,249 --> 00:28:53,365
I think it makes a lot of sense.

366
00:28:54,449 --> 00:28:57,486
- Refresh my memory.
- How could you forget?

367
00:28:57,848 --> 00:29:01,000
We talk about seeing other people
and you forget.

368
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:05,157
I must have blocked it out.

369
00:29:07,169 --> 00:29:10,479
Yeah. I guess I can understand that.

370
00:29:11,929 --> 00:29:15,318
But, please, don't start crying again.

371
00:29:25,249 --> 00:29:26,967
It's not gonna be forever.

372
00:29:27,048 --> 00:29:32,327
I figure three years is long enough
for the music to pan out, which it will.

373
00:29:32,648 --> 00:29:33,968
I know it.

374
00:29:34,169 --> 00:29:36,842
So right after graduation we should...

375
00:29:36,929 --> 00:29:40,079
...one: Start to see other people
so that we can...

376
00:29:40,368 --> 00:29:42,929
...two: We can comparison-shop.

377
00:29:43,648 --> 00:29:46,959
And then, three:
Settle down and get married.

378
00:29:49,608 --> 00:29:52,567
Why wait? Why not break up now?

379
00:29:53,848 --> 00:29:57,842
Because we got the prom coming up
and all these parties.

380
00:29:58,088 --> 00:30:01,763
- We don't want to upset our parents.
- They'll learn to live with it.

381
00:30:28,209 --> 00:30:29,278
Peggy Sue!

382
00:30:38,368 --> 00:30:41,361
Peggy Sue, come here.

383
00:30:55,209 --> 00:30:56,278
Peggy Sue.

384
00:30:56,929 --> 00:30:58,601
Did you study for the test?

385
00:30:58,689 --> 00:31:02,364
- Test? There's a test?
- Yeah.

386
00:31:12,209 --> 00:31:14,244
All right, class. Time's up.

387
00:31:23,929 --> 00:31:26,363
And what's the meaning of this,
Peggy Sue?

388
00:31:27,169 --> 00:31:29,046
Mr. Snelgrove...

389
00:31:29,489 --> 00:31:33,277
...I happen to know that in the future
I will have no use for algebra.

390
00:31:33,368 --> 00:31:35,165
And I speak from experience.

391
00:31:38,368 --> 00:31:39,961
- Who said that?
- I'm sorry.

392
00:31:40,048 --> 00:31:41,038
Sit down!

393
00:31:41,209 --> 00:31:45,361
The result of his struggle is
that Santiago comes back with honour.

394
00:31:45,449 --> 00:31:47,837
Santiago comes back with nothing!

395
00:31:48,288 --> 00:31:50,086
There's no meat on the bone.

396
00:31:50,169 --> 00:31:52,842
It's Hemingway's ego
trying to defend itself again.

397
00:31:52,929 --> 00:31:55,124
Trying to prove he can still perform.

398
00:31:55,209 --> 00:31:58,758
What Hemingway's saying, Michael,
is that we are alone.

399
00:31:58,848 --> 00:32:01,488
That when we go out too far,
we're vulnerable.

400
00:32:01,848 --> 00:32:05,159
The irony that Santiago
is beaten by the sharks...

401
00:32:05,608 --> 00:32:07,724
...doesn't make him less of a hero.

402
00:32:07,848 --> 00:32:10,238
Who is the victim and who is the predator?

403
00:32:12,848 --> 00:32:14,919
We'll finish this discussion next week.

404
00:32:15,009 --> 00:32:18,922
And don't forget, first four chapters
of The Great Gatsby by Monday.

405
00:32:19,328 --> 00:32:20,807
Hope you enjoy it.

406
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:32,801
Why does your father take inventory
on Sunday nights?

407
00:32:32,888 --> 00:32:34,038
Hi, Peggy.

408
00:32:34,128 --> 00:32:37,359
It's poker night.
You always got out of it before.

409
00:32:37,449 --> 00:32:40,998
I just gotta string him along for a while.
It's for his own good.

410
00:32:41,088 --> 00:32:44,398
You're not going into his business.
When are you gonna tell him?

411
00:32:44,489 --> 00:32:45,398
Soon.

412
00:32:48,769 --> 00:32:49,484
Walter!

413
00:32:49,568 --> 00:32:51,763
I can't tell everybody everything
all at once.

414
00:32:51,848 --> 00:32:54,602
Strange rumours
are sweeping the school about you.

415
00:32:54,689 --> 00:32:56,008
Hi, Peggy.

416
00:32:56,088 --> 00:32:57,203
What do you mean?

417
00:32:57,288 --> 00:33:01,680
- I hear you gave it to old Smellygrove.
- I was there! She told him off to his face!

418
00:33:01,769 --> 00:33:02,917
Attagirl, Peg!

419
00:33:03,009 --> 00:33:04,760
Arthur, please don't call me Peg.

420
00:33:04,848 --> 00:33:06,362
"Why, I oughta..."

421
00:33:09,128 --> 00:33:10,084
I don't get it.

422
00:33:10,169 --> 00:33:12,557
That's 'cause you're not
a total moron like they are.

423
00:33:12,648 --> 00:33:14,445
It's a stupid movie thing they started.

424
00:33:14,528 --> 00:33:16,440
That's enough outta you, little lady!

425
00:33:19,449 --> 00:33:20,961
"Why, I oughta..."

426
00:33:23,808 --> 00:33:25,321
I'll be right back.

427
00:33:30,169 --> 00:33:31,727
Hi, Richard.

428
00:33:32,929 --> 00:33:36,079
I wanted to congratulate you
on winning the math contest.

429
00:33:36,608 --> 00:33:38,280
It really wasn't that difficult.

430
00:33:38,368 --> 00:33:41,679
What are you doing?
You fishing for four-eyed worms?

431
00:33:42,368 --> 00:33:44,404
Get lost, you macho schmuck!

432
00:33:48,449 --> 00:33:51,486
I wanted to talk to you.
It's really important.

433
00:33:52,088 --> 00:33:54,603
I'm not doing any tutoring this year.
I'm too busy.

434
00:33:54,689 --> 00:33:56,644
No, it's not about that.

435
00:33:56,888 --> 00:33:59,356
Would you meet me after school, please?

436
00:34:02,808 --> 00:34:05,606
All right. I'll be in the physics lab.

437
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:11,442
Make it 4:30.
I have to go to a Rocket Club meeting.

438
00:34:11,528 --> 00:34:12,358
Sure.

439
00:34:18,128 --> 00:34:19,880
She's not wasting any time.

440
00:34:20,009 --> 00:34:23,684
- Peggy Sue and Mr. Square Root.
- He's a nice guy. He's writing a book.

441
00:34:23,969 --> 00:34:26,802
A book? Excuse me for a second.

442
00:34:28,289 --> 00:34:30,007
Why is she punishing herself?

443
00:34:50,929 --> 00:34:54,637
Come on, Peggy Sue. Try it again.
You haven't been practising.

444
00:34:54,728 --> 00:34:55,878
Sorry.

445
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:58,766
What a girl, what a twirl.
Peg "Leggy" Sue Kelcher.

446
00:34:58,849 --> 00:35:01,760
A brief but glorious career as a majorette.

447
00:35:04,248 --> 00:35:05,159
Baby!

448
00:35:08,809 --> 00:35:10,447
Looking good out there!

449
00:35:10,688 --> 00:35:11,643
Thanks.

450
00:35:16,449 --> 00:35:18,643
I love it when you twirl your baton.

451
00:35:22,128 --> 00:35:25,360
I noticed you were giving me
the silent treatment at lunch.

452
00:35:26,648 --> 00:35:28,206
I guess I deserved it.

453
00:35:28,329 --> 00:35:30,842
I've been thinking
about my three-year plan.

454
00:35:30,969 --> 00:35:34,757
I think it's totally unworkable.
I must have been delirious.

455
00:35:36,009 --> 00:35:38,284
I don't know.
I thought it made some sense.

456
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:42,043
Well, in the abstract, maybe.
Get a good grip on yourself.

457
00:35:44,048 --> 00:35:48,440
When I think about you going out
with other guys, I feel...

458
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:52,800
Rejected? Worthless? Miserable?

459
00:35:54,849 --> 00:35:55,963
Yeah.

460
00:35:57,449 --> 00:35:58,563
Good.

461
00:36:21,009 --> 00:36:22,282
Boy, that's some kite!

462
00:36:22,489 --> 00:36:24,878
I'm writing a book on kite construction.

463
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:27,405
So what do you wanna talk about?

464
00:36:28,449 --> 00:36:30,565
I just wanted to ask you a question.

465
00:36:33,208 --> 00:36:35,768
Do you think time travel is possible?

466
00:36:38,208 --> 00:36:41,326
- Are you doing a science project?
- Sort of.

467
00:36:43,369 --> 00:36:46,360
Well, that's a very interesting question.

468
00:36:46,889 --> 00:36:48,163
Well, now, let's see.

469
00:36:48,248 --> 00:36:51,559
If we look at this
in a Newtonian framework...

470
00:36:52,128 --> 00:36:54,882
...the possibilities of time travel
were limited.

471
00:36:55,248 --> 00:36:59,128
With the advent of the relativity theory,
that's Einstein's relativity theory...

472
00:36:59,208 --> 00:37:02,201
...the idea of absolute time
cannot be reasonably affirmed.

473
00:37:03,489 --> 00:37:06,083
Well, then we have Richard's burrito.

474
00:37:07,409 --> 00:37:08,318
What's that?

475
00:37:08,409 --> 00:37:11,639
That's my own theory,
based on a Mexican food called the burrito.

476
00:37:11,809 --> 00:37:15,483
- I had one at Disneyland.
- I know what a burrito is!

477
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:19,527
You see, I think that time is like a burrito...

478
00:37:20,329 --> 00:37:23,445
...in the sense that one part of itself
will fold over...

479
00:37:23,528 --> 00:37:26,362
...and it will just touch the other part.

480
00:37:26,889 --> 00:37:29,925
- What's inside?
- You can fill it with whatever you want.

481
00:37:30,009 --> 00:37:34,480
You can fill it with memories,
with experiences, trigonometry. Anything.

482
00:37:35,889 --> 00:37:39,358
Then you think
that time travel is possible for people?

483
00:37:39,528 --> 00:37:41,679
Yes, it is. It is possible.

484
00:37:42,329 --> 00:37:46,766
It's absolutely possible for people,
dogs, elephants, cancan girls.

485
00:37:47,608 --> 00:37:49,088
Then I'm not crazy!

486
00:37:50,728 --> 00:37:52,878
I really don't know if you're crazy.

487
00:37:53,489 --> 00:37:55,400
I know most people think I am.

488
00:37:58,248 --> 00:37:59,601
- Come here, Richard.
- What?

489
00:37:59,688 --> 00:38:01,407
- Come on.
- What are you doing?

490
00:38:01,489 --> 00:38:03,240
Wait a minute, what are you...

491
00:38:03,809 --> 00:38:08,405
Now, I want to tell you something.
You have to promise not to tell anyone!

492
00:38:08,489 --> 00:38:11,958
- Okay. I won't.
- No, I'm serious. No one else can know.

493
00:38:12,449 --> 00:38:15,168
I won't.
I promise, I'm not gonna tell anybody.

494
00:38:16,809 --> 00:38:21,121
I have come here from the future,
from 25 years ahead.

495
00:38:23,369 --> 00:38:25,485
I think that you're probably crazy.

496
00:38:28,409 --> 00:38:31,161
I don't have time for this.
I don't have time for jokes.

497
00:38:31,248 --> 00:38:33,809
- I know what you people think about me.
- No!

498
00:38:33,889 --> 00:38:35,322
And I don't appreciate it!

499
00:38:35,929 --> 00:38:38,443
You're just the smartest guy I knew to ask.

500
00:38:38,849 --> 00:38:41,409
I know it sounds unbelievable,
but I can prove it.

501
00:38:42,449 --> 00:38:45,521
Well, proof is an excellent concept. How?

502
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:48,007
You have a blind grandfather.

503
00:38:48,088 --> 00:38:51,081
You're gonna invent this machine
that reads books for the blind.

504
00:38:51,168 --> 00:38:54,478
You're gonna invent a lot of things.
You're gonna be really famous.

505
00:38:54,568 --> 00:38:56,240
Wait a minute.

506
00:38:57,329 --> 00:38:59,206
How did you know about my grandfather?

507
00:38:59,289 --> 00:39:01,358
Because I'm telling you the truth.

508
00:39:01,568 --> 00:39:03,844
I read about your invention in a magazine.

509
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:06,438
I know a lot of things
that are gonna happen.

510
00:39:06,528 --> 00:39:09,838
There's gonna be test-tube babies
and heart transplants.

511
00:39:10,489 --> 00:39:11,717
An American...

512
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:16,206
...named Neil Armstrong
will be the first man to walk on the moon.

513
00:39:16,329 --> 00:39:19,047
July 20, 1969.

514
00:39:22,168 --> 00:39:24,398
1969?

515
00:39:28,489 --> 00:39:30,605
That's six years ahead of schedule.

516
00:39:32,768 --> 00:39:35,123
I would be very careful about this
if I were you.

517
00:39:35,208 --> 00:39:37,483
What if you fall into the hands
of some madman...

518
00:39:37,568 --> 00:39:41,481
...with plans to manipulate your brain?
- Well, that's why I was getting a divorce.

519
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:43,480
You know what I really think happened?

520
00:39:43,568 --> 00:39:46,036
I think I had a heart attack
at the reunion and died.

521
00:39:46,369 --> 00:39:48,599
- You look great for a corpse.
- I'm serious.

522
00:39:48,688 --> 00:39:51,407
- You're giving me the creeps.
- Well, am I dead or not?

523
00:39:51,568 --> 00:39:53,365
There's one way to find out.

524
00:39:53,449 --> 00:39:54,961
- Give me this.
- What are you doing?

525
00:39:55,048 --> 00:39:57,688
Confucians say, "If you want a way out,
go through a door."

526
00:39:57,768 --> 00:40:01,239
There's a fire truck.
If you're dead, it'll pass right through you.

527
00:40:01,329 --> 00:40:04,161
Now just stay there. You're dead.

528
00:40:08,409 --> 00:40:09,364
Young lady!

529
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:10,882
No, I don't wanna die!

530
00:40:12,648 --> 00:40:14,047
It's all right.

531
00:40:14,128 --> 00:40:15,800
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

532
00:40:19,409 --> 00:40:21,764
I had it made into a cocktail ring, though.

533
00:40:22,009 --> 00:40:23,157
This is good.

534
00:40:24,528 --> 00:40:27,407
Well, there's not a whole heck
of a lot here.

535
00:40:27,489 --> 00:40:29,445
- Very nice pieces.
- So, thank you.

536
00:40:29,528 --> 00:40:32,726
I'll take them to the shop
and have the appraisal ready next week.

537
00:40:32,809 --> 00:40:35,277
- Good day, Mrs. Kelcher.
- Good-bye.

538
00:40:35,809 --> 00:40:39,119
- Who was that man?
- That was nobody, Peggy.

539
00:40:41,969 --> 00:40:43,960
I'm voting for the Democrats this year.

540
00:40:44,048 --> 00:40:46,358
You know how your father feels
about Democrats.

541
00:40:46,449 --> 00:40:50,521
That was a polltaker.
I wouldn't mention it, if I were you.

542
00:40:51,128 --> 00:40:53,005
How was school today, darling?

543
00:40:53,088 --> 00:40:55,967
It was nice to see everybody again.

544
00:40:56,449 --> 00:40:59,121
I don't know.
Everything they teach is so useless.

545
00:40:59,208 --> 00:41:01,768
And the lunch! God, that was the worst!

546
00:41:03,009 --> 00:41:04,327
Get that, Peggy.

547
00:41:10,648 --> 00:41:13,083
- Hello?
- Peggy Sue? This is Grandma.

548
00:41:13,289 --> 00:41:15,280
- Grandma?
- How's my little girl been?

549
00:41:15,528 --> 00:41:18,123
- Grandpa and I are very concerned.
- What's the matter?

550
00:41:18,208 --> 00:41:19,244
What's up?

551
00:41:19,329 --> 00:41:23,958
- It's Grandma. I can't talk. I'm sorry.
- What's wrong?

552
00:41:25,809 --> 00:41:29,324
Mom, I'll call you back. It's Peggy.

553
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:32,248
It's okay. I'll call you back.

554
00:41:32,688 --> 00:41:34,599
Peggy Sue, what is it?

555
00:41:34,688 --> 00:41:37,806
What happened to you just now?
What is this all about?

556
00:41:38,568 --> 00:41:40,400
I dreamed that Grandma died.

557
00:41:40,568 --> 00:41:43,958
Oh, baby. No wonder you're so upset.

558
00:41:44,608 --> 00:41:48,396
She's getting on, it's true, but she's fine.

559
00:41:48,648 --> 00:41:50,878
I told her
you weren't feeling well yesterday.

560
00:41:50,969 --> 00:41:53,039
She called to find out how you are.

561
00:41:53,248 --> 00:41:57,208
I love her so much
and I haven't seen her in so long.

562
00:41:58,608 --> 00:42:01,248
- Grandpa Barney, is he all right?
- He's perfectly fine.

563
00:42:01,329 --> 00:42:04,639
You saw them at Easter.
What's this all about, Peggy?

564
00:42:05,088 --> 00:42:08,081
I don't know. I forgot.

565
00:42:09,648 --> 00:42:14,085
- I'll call her tomorrow. I'll apologise.
- Good girl. I hate to see you so upset.

566
00:42:14,528 --> 00:42:16,280
You're my angel.

567
00:42:18,528 --> 00:42:21,327
Peggy, I don't mean to be intrusive.

568
00:42:22,489 --> 00:42:27,278
But are you having problems with Charlie?
You mentioned something this morning.

569
00:42:27,608 --> 00:42:30,077
A lot of things are confusing right now.

570
00:42:30,449 --> 00:42:31,847
Charlie's just one of them.

571
00:42:31,929 --> 00:42:35,922
Is Charlie pressuring you to do things
you don't think you should be doing?

572
00:42:36,009 --> 00:42:37,362
What do you mean?

573
00:42:39,728 --> 00:42:41,719
Peggy, you know what a penis is.

574
00:42:42,969 --> 00:42:44,367
Stay away from it.

575
00:42:55,449 --> 00:42:56,768
You're the best.

576
00:42:57,009 --> 00:42:59,239
Make her love me, okay?

577
00:42:59,929 --> 00:43:01,885
Feed me. Charge me.

578
00:43:03,969 --> 00:43:05,367
Go get her, tiger.

579
00:43:13,608 --> 00:43:15,918
Get the door, Jack!

580
00:43:16,728 --> 00:43:18,320
Just a moment!

581
00:43:23,048 --> 00:43:24,322
Hello, Charlie.

582
00:43:24,409 --> 00:43:26,206
- Hello, Mr. Kelcher.
- Come on in.

583
00:43:26,289 --> 00:43:28,849
- How are things at the hat store?
- Very good.

584
00:43:29,009 --> 00:43:31,079
Charlie, could I have a word with you?

585
00:43:31,168 --> 00:43:33,204
- Something wrong, sir?
- No, not a thing.

586
00:43:33,329 --> 00:43:35,081
I'd just like to talk to you.

587
00:43:35,369 --> 00:43:36,882
Hi, Mrs. Kelcher!

588
00:43:36,969 --> 00:43:39,005
- How do you do today?
- Good.

589
00:43:39,088 --> 00:43:41,478
- You look wonderful. Snap, crackle, pop.
- They're delicious.

590
00:43:44,608 --> 00:43:46,201
Sit down, Charlie.

591
00:43:47,489 --> 00:43:48,239
Nancy.

592
00:43:48,329 --> 00:43:50,967
That sounded really great, Nancy.

593
00:43:51,528 --> 00:43:53,644
Charlie, you may have noticed that...

594
00:43:53,728 --> 00:43:56,686
...Peggy Sue has been acting
a little bit strange lately?

595
00:43:56,768 --> 00:43:58,760
- Indeed.
- She's distorted!

596
00:43:59,449 --> 00:44:00,927
Nancy, please.

597
00:44:01,329 --> 00:44:06,119
She seems to be
a little bit nervous and confused.

598
00:44:07,208 --> 00:44:12,077
Over-emotional and even a little bit
irresponsible at times.

599
00:44:14,248 --> 00:44:17,684
Of course, her mother says,
"That's the way girls act sometimes."

600
00:44:17,768 --> 00:44:20,123
She's almost a juvenile delinquent.

601
00:44:20,289 --> 00:44:21,516
- No!
- Out!

602
00:44:21,648 --> 00:44:23,240
"Why, I oughta..."

603
00:44:26,208 --> 00:44:27,436
Oh, God!

604
00:44:27,929 --> 00:44:32,001
Yes, sir, but I think that's what I like
about Peggy, Mr. Kelcher.

605
00:44:32,289 --> 00:44:35,280
She's not like all the other girls at school.

606
00:44:36,329 --> 00:44:40,527
Charlie, in spite of your adolescent
infatuation with music...

607
00:44:40,648 --> 00:44:43,606
...we've always regarded you
as a very fine young man.

608
00:44:43,688 --> 00:44:46,998
- Thank you, sir.
- And we've trusted you with our daughter.

609
00:44:47,088 --> 00:44:49,398
Well, trust is a two-way street.

610
00:44:49,969 --> 00:44:51,288
In the past two years...

611
00:44:51,369 --> 00:44:55,248
...l've been pleased to note
that you and Mrs. Kelcher...

612
00:44:55,329 --> 00:44:58,320
...have provided your sacred trust
with upbringing the woman...

613
00:44:58,409 --> 00:45:00,445
...that I plan to take off your hands.

614
00:45:03,608 --> 00:45:06,442
Charlie's downstairs.
Why aren't you ready?

615
00:45:07,289 --> 00:45:10,326
- For what?
- For Maddy's party, that's for what!

616
00:45:11,289 --> 00:45:13,438
Mom, I don't feel like going to a party.

617
00:45:13,528 --> 00:45:17,317
Feel or not feel, you accepted the invite.
Maddy's one of your best friends.

618
00:45:17,409 --> 00:45:19,603
I baked the Rice Krispie squares.

619
00:45:19,809 --> 00:45:22,606
You're supposed to be doing
your homework.

620
00:45:22,806 --> 00:45:25,036
I need to talk to your sister.

621
00:45:26,646 --> 00:45:27,760
Baby.

622
00:45:28,446 --> 00:45:30,356
Try and enjoy yourself.

623
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:33,484
This is the best time of your whole life.

624
00:45:33,726 --> 00:45:36,763
The sooner you learn to handle Charlie,
the better.

625
00:45:36,966 --> 00:45:38,718
Stand up to Charlie.

626
00:45:41,966 --> 00:45:45,242
Be a good girl.
Wear something cheerful. Perky.

627
00:45:50,726 --> 00:45:53,115
We think this party might cheer her up.

628
00:45:53,486 --> 00:45:55,841
As long as you understand
what's expected of you.

629
00:45:55,926 --> 00:45:57,075
What would that be?

630
00:45:57,166 --> 00:46:00,920
Show her a good time,
but for heaven's sake, restrain yourself!

631
00:46:01,325 --> 00:46:02,644
Of course!

632
00:46:05,806 --> 00:46:07,205
- Hi.
- Hi.

633
00:46:08,325 --> 00:46:09,519
Charlie?

634
00:46:10,086 --> 00:46:11,644
Your sweater!

635
00:46:11,766 --> 00:46:14,519
- It's great, isn't it?
- It's really '50s!

636
00:46:14,606 --> 00:46:16,722
It's like you clash with the whole world.

637
00:46:16,845 --> 00:46:20,282
What's the fun of being a teenager
if you can't dress weird?

638
00:46:22,806 --> 00:46:24,363
- Good night, Dad.
- Good night!

639
00:46:24,446 --> 00:46:26,720
- Good night, Mom.
- Be good, dear.

640
00:46:27,526 --> 00:46:29,720
- Good night, Mr. And Mrs. Kelcher.
- Good-bye.

641
00:46:29,806 --> 00:46:32,001
Have a good time, youngsters!

642
00:46:35,325 --> 00:46:36,679
Nancy.

643
00:46:50,325 --> 00:46:52,157
You look really beautiful.

644
00:46:52,246 --> 00:46:53,565
Thank you.

645
00:46:53,766 --> 00:46:57,475
- I cleaned the car. Do you like it?
- Yeah, looks better at night.

646
00:46:57,606 --> 00:47:00,359
I got tickets for Fabian on your birthday.

647
00:47:00,446 --> 00:47:03,084
You like him, right? Yeah, he's cool.

648
00:47:16,446 --> 00:47:19,199
I was thinking of four ushers
and four bridesmaids.

649
00:47:19,286 --> 00:47:22,164
The Yankees have the pitching,
but the White Sox have defence.

650
00:47:22,246 --> 00:47:23,644
What will your colours be?

651
00:47:23,726 --> 00:47:26,194
Kubek and Richardson any day
over Fox and Aparicio.

652
00:47:26,286 --> 00:47:27,514
Pink and green.

653
00:47:28,406 --> 00:47:29,885
- Look, Carol!
- What?

654
00:47:29,966 --> 00:47:31,604
Look at Delores. What a tramp.

655
00:47:31,686 --> 00:47:32,516
My God!

656
00:47:32,606 --> 00:47:34,756
I think that pitching wins pennants.

657
00:47:35,486 --> 00:47:38,444
The Tigers have got four
twenty-game potential winners.

658
00:47:38,526 --> 00:47:41,642
You'd be surprised
at how many girls in school aren't virgins.

659
00:47:41,726 --> 00:47:42,715
Like who?

660
00:47:42,805 --> 00:47:46,798
Don Mossi, Frank Lary,
Jim Bunning and Paul Foytack.

661
00:47:51,646 --> 00:47:53,124
- Hello?
- Hello!

662
00:47:56,606 --> 00:48:00,724
And now, direct from four weeks
of rehearsal in Walter's garage...

663
00:48:00,805 --> 00:48:04,845
...four guys who have prided themselves
on becoming the best group in the world.

664
00:48:04,926 --> 00:48:09,204
Walter, Leon, Terry and Charlie,
The Definitions!

665
00:48:44,206 --> 00:48:45,798
Charlie can really sing!

666
00:48:45,885 --> 00:48:48,354
Maybe they'll be
the next Dion and the Belmonts!

667
00:48:48,446 --> 00:48:49,765
I wouldn't count on it.

668
00:48:49,845 --> 00:48:51,598
Come on! Where's your enthusiasm?

669
00:49:05,446 --> 00:49:07,243
He really is kind of cute, isn't he?

670
00:49:07,325 --> 00:49:08,600
Yeah!

671
00:49:10,646 --> 00:49:12,682
He really loves you, too. You're so lucky!

672
00:49:12,766 --> 00:49:14,961
He's always telling Walter
how wonderful you are.

673
00:49:15,046 --> 00:49:16,274
- He is?
- Yeah!

674
00:49:34,526 --> 00:49:37,359
Carol and I saw you
with that creep Richard Norvik today.

675
00:49:37,446 --> 00:49:40,199
First of all, he's not a creep.
He's exceptional.

676
00:49:40,286 --> 00:49:42,516
You'd know that if you took any time.

677
00:49:42,686 --> 00:49:45,325
You just pity him since he has no friends.

678
00:49:45,766 --> 00:49:47,996
If you weren't so neurotic and insecure...

679
00:49:48,086 --> 00:49:51,044
...maybe you could shut up
and show some compassion.

680
00:49:51,126 --> 00:49:52,559
Are you for real?

681
00:49:53,805 --> 00:49:56,639
I don't know what you said to her,
but I wish I'd said it.

682
00:49:56,726 --> 00:49:58,079
Hi, fellas.

683
00:50:19,086 --> 00:50:20,439
Walter!

684
00:50:31,406 --> 00:50:34,762
- What do you think about Richard Norvik?
- He's a nice guy.

685
00:50:36,206 --> 00:50:38,673
Is he going to help you
with all that physics stuff?

686
00:50:38,766 --> 00:50:39,959
He's trying.

687
00:50:41,606 --> 00:50:44,439
Who needs physics
when we've got chemistry?

688
00:50:44,726 --> 00:50:47,763
Put on some make-out music
and turn out the lights!

689
00:51:04,206 --> 00:51:07,881
There's not a girl in school
that can hold a candle to you.

690
00:51:08,885 --> 00:51:11,639
You're pretty charming
when you want to be.

691
00:51:13,845 --> 00:51:18,283
I know. But I don't have to flatter you.

692
00:51:20,566 --> 00:51:22,318
It just feels right.

693
00:51:24,086 --> 00:51:26,202
You're the perfect girl for me...

694
00:51:27,126 --> 00:51:30,276
...as in: Is, was...

695
00:51:33,166 --> 00:51:34,997
...and always will be.

696
00:51:40,766 --> 00:51:42,996
I'm glad dancing was invented.

697
00:51:44,286 --> 00:51:47,039
You know, the first dances were rituals.

698
00:51:49,365 --> 00:51:51,401
Like fertility rites.

699
00:52:10,606 --> 00:52:13,039
I always loved the way you kissed.

700
00:52:15,286 --> 00:52:16,923
I missed you.

701
00:52:22,805 --> 00:52:27,118
Your eyes look like silver pools
of moonlight.

702
00:52:29,246 --> 00:52:31,157
And the tide rushes in.

703
00:52:33,966 --> 00:52:36,115
You really love me, don't you?

704
00:52:36,206 --> 00:52:40,836
You know I do.
I even wrote you into my will.

705
00:52:45,606 --> 00:52:48,642
Charlie, let's make love.

706
00:52:49,686 --> 00:52:52,484
What? You mean sex?

707
00:52:55,246 --> 00:52:56,644
Intercourse.

708
00:52:59,086 --> 00:53:01,156
You want to have intercourse?

709
00:53:01,966 --> 00:53:05,675
Last weekend you said... What time is it?

710
00:53:05,926 --> 00:53:08,235
Holy cow, it's late!

711
00:53:08,325 --> 00:53:11,363
A lot of things have happened
since last weekend.

712
00:53:11,606 --> 00:53:14,678
You were the one who said we should wait
and you were right.

713
00:53:14,766 --> 00:53:17,234
We should wait till we get married.

714
00:53:17,726 --> 00:53:20,559
I know I must have believed that...

715
00:53:20,646 --> 00:53:23,285
...when I said it, but...

716
00:53:23,365 --> 00:53:25,959
...doesn't Lucky Chucky want to come out?
- Who?

717
00:53:26,325 --> 00:53:29,557
You know, your love machine.

718
00:53:30,726 --> 00:53:34,196
Your throbbing thrill hammer. Your thing.

719
00:53:35,845 --> 00:53:37,484
You mean my wang?

720
00:53:39,365 --> 00:53:42,278
Listen, it's running real late!

721
00:53:50,166 --> 00:53:53,316
Come on! What is this?

722
00:53:54,446 --> 00:53:57,039
What the hell is going on, Peggy Sue?

723
00:53:57,406 --> 00:53:59,920
One week you say,
"If you love me, you won't."

724
00:54:00,006 --> 00:54:02,394
The next week you say,
"If you love me, you will."

725
00:54:02,486 --> 00:54:04,238
That's a guy's line!

726
00:54:06,365 --> 00:54:08,800
Forget about it. I made a mistake.

727
00:54:08,885 --> 00:54:10,763
You're damn right!

728
00:54:11,566 --> 00:54:15,036
Jesus, Peggy,
you sure know how to spoil a mood.

729
00:54:23,966 --> 00:54:25,194
I'm sorry.

730
00:54:25,365 --> 00:54:28,199
Save it, woman! Humiliator!

731
00:55:18,286 --> 00:55:22,199
I was very impressed with what you said
in English class today.

732
00:55:24,686 --> 00:55:28,361
Gilford's okay, except that he thinks
that Hemingway's great literature.

733
00:55:28,446 --> 00:55:29,925
And you don't?

734
00:55:30,806 --> 00:55:32,364
He's a fisherman.

735
00:55:32,446 --> 00:55:35,039
The most overrated writer of the century.

736
00:55:35,126 --> 00:55:37,765
I mean, man,
he is the perfect American author:

737
00:55:37,846 --> 00:55:39,757
Fat, violent, drunk.

738
00:55:40,766 --> 00:55:43,758
Maybe you're confusing his life
with his work.

739
00:55:43,846 --> 00:55:45,996
A writer's life is his work.

740
00:55:46,406 --> 00:55:50,035
Jack Kerouac doesn't have to kill a bull
to have something to write about!

741
00:55:50,126 --> 00:55:54,039
I mean, man, he's out there burning,
feeling, grooving on life!

742
00:55:55,446 --> 00:55:57,755
"The young man leaned back in his chair.

743
00:55:57,966 --> 00:55:59,957
"No bulls would die today."

744
00:56:06,046 --> 00:56:08,640
What are you doing here, anyway?

745
00:56:08,846 --> 00:56:10,359
Coffee, donuts.

746
00:56:12,606 --> 00:56:15,564
I thought chicks like you travelled in packs.

747
00:56:17,365 --> 00:56:21,041
Man, I'm a hip chick.

748
00:56:34,365 --> 00:56:36,516
- Come on, Delores.
- Terry, slow down!

749
00:56:36,606 --> 00:56:37,721
What?

750
00:56:38,446 --> 00:56:41,483
Look, there's Peggy Sue
with Michael Fitzsimmons!

751
00:56:42,206 --> 00:56:46,358
- That Commie beatnik?
- First a geek and now a weirdo!

752
00:56:54,446 --> 00:56:55,925
This is great.

753
00:57:06,885 --> 00:57:08,797
This is great reefer.

754
00:57:14,486 --> 00:57:15,965
It must belong to Beth.

755
00:57:16,046 --> 00:57:18,514
I found it in my dress. It's really old.

756
00:57:19,206 --> 00:57:20,798
It travels well.

757
00:57:23,926 --> 00:57:26,679
Well, the world sure looks better up here.

758
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:31,356
The world is fantastic.

759
00:57:33,406 --> 00:57:35,840
It's the ultimate absurd circus.

760
00:57:37,606 --> 00:57:41,235
And I am shot from a cannon
into the energy.

761
00:57:41,766 --> 00:57:43,802
What are you shooting for?

762
00:57:44,486 --> 00:57:47,239
Maximum intensity.

763
00:57:48,885 --> 00:57:51,605
I'm going to get out of here.
I'm going to write.

764
00:57:51,766 --> 00:57:53,722
I'm checking out of this bourgeois motel.

765
00:57:53,806 --> 00:57:56,320
Push myself away from the dinner table
and say:

766
00:57:56,406 --> 00:57:58,966
"No more Jell-O for me, Mom!"

767
00:58:07,526 --> 00:58:09,914
Don't you get along with your parents?

768
00:58:11,006 --> 00:58:13,156
All my father digs is money.

769
00:58:13,686 --> 00:58:17,076
All my mother cares about
is her standing at the country club.

770
00:58:17,166 --> 00:58:20,044
Come on! They care about you.

771
00:58:20,806 --> 00:58:24,082
- They're just a different generation.
- What's with you?

772
00:58:25,486 --> 00:58:27,442
I thought you were cool.

773
00:58:27,686 --> 00:58:30,154
You rode my bike. You blew some pot.

774
00:58:32,166 --> 00:58:34,839
What's your scene, Miss Majorette?

775
00:58:36,926 --> 00:58:38,803
You going to marry Mr. Blue lmpala...

776
00:58:38,926 --> 00:58:42,396
...and graze around with the other sheep
for the rest of your life?

777
00:58:42,966 --> 00:58:45,400
No. I already did that.

778
00:58:48,726 --> 00:58:51,763
I want to be a dancer.

779
00:58:53,166 --> 00:58:55,077
That's what I want to do.

780
00:58:57,086 --> 00:59:00,202
I'm going to dance and dance.

781
00:59:04,806 --> 00:59:06,285
Come here.

782
00:59:07,486 --> 00:59:09,635
You know, I had you pegged all wrong.

783
00:59:13,606 --> 00:59:16,200
"Ray of oneness piercing the solitude

784
00:59:17,286 --> 00:59:19,959
"Falling bodies in the ecstasy of flesh"

785
00:59:22,006 --> 00:59:23,883
Is that one of your poems?

786
00:59:23,966 --> 00:59:25,604
No, I just made that up.

787
00:59:26,286 --> 00:59:29,005
- Do you want to hear one?
- Yeah.

788
00:59:32,806 --> 00:59:34,797
It's called Tenderness.

789
00:59:36,846 --> 00:59:40,394
"I couldn't sleep so I thought I'd scream

790
00:59:41,326 --> 00:59:46,115
"Betrayed by a kiss
Sucking pods of bitterness

791
00:59:46,246 --> 00:59:51,115
"In the madhouse of Doctor Dread
Razor shreds of rat puke

792
00:59:51,246 --> 00:59:53,396
"Fall on my bare arms"

793
01:00:02,966 --> 01:00:05,605
I'm sorry. I was trying to impress you.

794
01:00:14,726 --> 01:00:18,321
Michael. You're as good as you looked.

795
01:00:26,646 --> 01:00:30,036
"How many loved your moments
of glad grace

796
01:00:30,126 --> 01:00:33,356
"And loved your beauty
with love false or true

797
01:00:35,566 --> 01:00:39,479
"But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you

798
01:00:39,726 --> 01:00:42,798
"And loved the sorrows
of your changing face"

799
01:00:43,926 --> 01:00:47,123
I didn't write that. That's Yeats.

800
01:00:53,966 --> 01:00:55,524
I envy you.

801
01:00:56,686 --> 01:01:00,884
You have your whole life ahead of you
and you know exactly what you want.

802
01:01:02,446 --> 01:01:04,323
But no more rat puke, okay?

803
01:01:04,766 --> 01:01:07,200
Try and write something beautiful.

804
01:01:08,566 --> 01:01:10,796
I'll respect you for eternity.

805
01:01:15,846 --> 01:01:19,725
You know, this really isn't happening.

806
01:01:45,806 --> 01:01:48,764
- And one Shostakovich.
- Shostakovich?

807
01:01:48,846 --> 01:01:51,314
Charlie, I'm just taking Ravel!

808
01:01:51,966 --> 01:01:54,480
Listen. Take the Shostakovich home.

809
01:01:55,006 --> 01:01:57,440
Listen to it. Let it grow on you.

810
01:01:57,966 --> 01:02:01,163
If you don't like it
I will give you your money back.

811
01:02:01,926 --> 01:02:05,316
I did like the Dvorak one you suggested.
I liked that a lot.

812
01:02:05,406 --> 01:02:07,522
And, young man, you talked me into it.

813
01:02:07,606 --> 01:02:09,358
It's the most definitive Dvorak!

814
01:02:09,766 --> 01:02:12,041
You'll like it. I kid you not.

815
01:02:21,206 --> 01:02:25,836
- What do you know about classical music?
- Nothing. But selling is selling.

816
01:02:26,526 --> 01:02:28,084
Charlie, about last night...

817
01:02:28,166 --> 01:02:32,045
Hush, baby, hush. I've been thinking.

818
01:02:32,365 --> 01:02:34,880
Girls must go through that stuff, too.

819
01:02:35,006 --> 01:02:37,998
Sometimes when I look at you
I feel like an animal.

820
01:02:38,086 --> 01:02:41,635
I don't know. Maybe my dad's right.
Teenagers are nuts.

821
01:02:41,846 --> 01:02:43,199
But I'm not.

822
01:02:43,286 --> 01:02:48,076
I'm a grown woman with a lifetime
of experiences you can't understand.

823
01:02:48,926 --> 01:02:51,519
Girls mature faster than guys.

824
01:02:52,766 --> 01:02:56,042
But last night,
I was the one who put on the brakes.

825
01:02:57,606 --> 01:02:59,881
- And do you know why?
- Why?

826
01:03:00,726 --> 01:03:02,921
Because nothing else matters.

827
01:03:03,286 --> 01:03:05,641
That's the great thing about love.

828
01:03:05,726 --> 01:03:07,478
Every time we argue...

829
01:03:07,766 --> 01:03:11,394
...every time something goes wrong,
and I know I'm not perfect either...

830
01:03:11,686 --> 01:03:13,756
...things just work out better in the end.

831
01:03:14,766 --> 01:03:17,917
Because you're my baby. And I love you.

832
01:03:19,606 --> 01:03:23,918
Charlie, what am I going to do with you?

833
01:03:26,526 --> 01:03:29,245
Boy! Just cherish me.

834
01:03:31,166 --> 01:03:33,839
You have an opportunity
to be the richest woman in the world...

835
01:03:33,926 --> 01:03:35,598
...and I'm going to be your partner.

836
01:03:35,686 --> 01:03:38,075
I'll tell you where the fortune is:
Running shoes...

837
01:03:38,166 --> 01:03:40,726
...tennis and jogging shoes,
all that kind of stuff.

838
01:03:40,806 --> 01:03:43,525
I mean, I'm talking $50, $100, $200 a pair.

839
01:03:43,606 --> 01:03:45,642
- Wait, you got to be kidding.
- No!

840
01:03:45,726 --> 01:03:48,684
You're talking about exercise stuff?
Like gym stuff?

841
01:03:48,766 --> 01:03:50,279
Not your style.

842
01:03:50,365 --> 01:03:52,516
These are the choices, okay?

843
01:03:52,846 --> 01:03:56,919
Microwave ovens, pocket calculators...

844
01:03:57,806 --> 01:04:01,640
...Walkmans, digital watches...

845
01:04:02,006 --> 01:04:04,201
...and miniature television sets.

846
01:04:04,286 --> 01:04:05,639
And huge radios.

847
01:04:05,726 --> 01:04:10,242
For some reason everything else gets tiny,
but portable radios get enormous.

848
01:04:10,326 --> 01:04:12,362
Huge, enormous radios?

849
01:04:12,885 --> 01:04:16,196
- Portable enormous radios.
- Wait a minute, I got an idea. Come on!

850
01:04:16,286 --> 01:04:17,798
- What?
- Come on!

851
01:04:20,486 --> 01:04:21,635
Come here!

852
01:04:23,526 --> 01:04:24,515
Here.

853
01:04:28,646 --> 01:04:29,965
- Excuse me, miss.
- Yes.

854
01:04:30,046 --> 01:04:32,435
- Do you have pantyhose?
- I'm sorry, what?

855
01:04:32,526 --> 01:04:34,437
Pantyhose. You know...

856
01:04:34,646 --> 01:04:35,965
"Pantyhose"?

857
01:04:36,086 --> 01:04:37,485
Why, Richard!

858
01:04:37,846 --> 01:04:39,518
This is lingerie.

859
01:04:39,846 --> 01:04:44,874
Mrs. Woodhouse, I am studying the fabric
for the aerodynamic principles for kites.

860
01:04:44,966 --> 01:04:46,365
They don't have it!

861
01:04:46,446 --> 01:04:48,641
They've never heard of it.
Isn't it wonderful?

862
01:04:48,726 --> 01:04:51,320
- What?
- I'm talking about the wave of the future.

863
01:04:51,406 --> 01:04:53,795
I've decided on our first fortune.

864
01:04:53,885 --> 01:04:55,239
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

865
01:04:55,326 --> 01:04:57,521
You just keep thinking high tech.

866
01:04:59,046 --> 01:05:02,834
"High tech"? That's nice.

867
01:05:03,286 --> 01:05:05,800
I like the sound of that. High tech.

868
01:05:21,446 --> 01:05:23,801
- All right, what is the scoop?
- What?

869
01:05:23,885 --> 01:05:26,400
How come we're your friends
and we find out about...

870
01:05:26,486 --> 01:05:28,602
...you and Michael Fitzsimmons
from Delores?

871
01:05:28,686 --> 01:05:31,836
Who needs satellites
when I've got Delores' mouth?

872
01:05:31,926 --> 01:05:34,201
I hear she does more than talk
with her mouth.

873
01:05:34,286 --> 01:05:35,435
That's disgusting!

874
01:05:35,526 --> 01:05:37,039
Maddy, would you grow up?

875
01:05:37,126 --> 01:05:40,004
It says in Love Without Fear
the tongue kiss is a means...

876
01:05:40,086 --> 01:05:43,795
...of genital stimulation, is widely practised
and has much to commend it!

877
01:05:44,086 --> 01:05:46,316
Did you memorise the book
or just the good parts?

878
01:05:46,406 --> 01:05:48,635
No. Just what you underlined.

879
01:05:49,006 --> 01:05:50,234
You did!

880
01:05:50,406 --> 01:05:53,000
You know, Carol, you have great hair.

881
01:05:53,446 --> 01:05:56,199
Peggy Sue, come on!
What's with you and Michael?

882
01:05:56,286 --> 01:05:59,119
Yeah, come on!
He's so cool and mysterious.

883
01:05:59,206 --> 01:06:01,117
Well, he's interesting.

884
01:06:02,806 --> 01:06:07,721
Underneath that rough exterior
lurks the heart of a true poet.

885
01:06:08,566 --> 01:06:09,760
A poet?

886
01:06:11,846 --> 01:06:13,643
I bet Delores told Charlie!

887
01:06:13,726 --> 01:06:16,286
- That loudmouthed little bitch!
- Peggy Sue!

888
01:06:16,365 --> 01:06:18,800
Watch out for her, Peggy Sue.
She's after Charlie.

889
01:06:18,885 --> 01:06:20,524
Just cool it, girls.

890
01:06:21,246 --> 01:06:24,477
Charlie's free to go out
with whoever he wants to.

891
01:06:24,646 --> 01:06:25,715
What?

892
01:06:25,926 --> 01:06:28,519
But I always thought
you were going to marry Charlie.

893
01:06:28,606 --> 01:06:31,803
Carol would marry Walter
and I'd marry Arthur.

894
01:06:31,885 --> 01:06:34,400
We'd all live on the same street and...

895
01:06:34,486 --> 01:06:38,718
...take our kids to the park together
and have barbecues every Sunday.

896
01:06:38,806 --> 01:06:41,957
It's going to spoil everything
if you and Charlie break up.

897
01:06:42,046 --> 01:06:45,402
That Michael Fitzsimmons
doesn't look like the barbecue type.

898
01:06:45,486 --> 01:06:49,957
Come on! I just had one date with him.
I'm not going to marry him!

899
01:06:50,246 --> 01:06:51,838
You promise?

900
01:06:52,406 --> 01:06:54,397
Come on, let's go to the movies.

901
01:06:55,006 --> 01:06:58,794
Peggy Sue, I mean, don't be silly.
It's Saturday night. It's date night.

902
01:06:58,885 --> 01:07:01,002
I got to go. Arthur's picking me up soon.

903
01:07:01,086 --> 01:07:03,554
Wait a minute. No, I mean just the girls.

904
01:07:03,646 --> 01:07:05,682
Like a slumber party.

905
01:07:05,846 --> 01:07:09,361
- Aren't we too old for that?
- Sometimes you're so immature.

906
01:07:09,446 --> 01:07:10,515
Well, we...

907
01:07:10,646 --> 01:07:11,760
'Bye!

908
01:07:13,046 --> 01:07:14,479
I'm immature?

909
01:07:52,126 --> 01:07:56,722
Charlie? Charlie, I had such a dream.

910
01:07:57,406 --> 01:08:00,796
Peggy Sue, I have to talk to you.

911
01:08:02,086 --> 01:08:04,475
Charlie, what are you doing here?

912
01:08:05,286 --> 01:08:07,516
Let's go down to the basement.

913
01:08:09,046 --> 01:08:10,161
Okay.

914
01:08:19,966 --> 01:08:22,240
I want to know what's going on.

915
01:08:23,126 --> 01:08:27,721
Delores told me about you
and that scuzzball Michael Fitzsimmons.

916
01:08:29,206 --> 01:08:32,801
When you dropped me off last night
I didn't feel like going to bed.

917
01:08:32,886 --> 01:08:36,673
- And I ran into Michael and went for a ride.
- Then it's true, damn it!

918
01:08:40,565 --> 01:08:43,557
I had a miserable time tonight
because of you.

919
01:08:46,326 --> 01:08:48,362
When the Monotones did Book of Love:

920
01:08:48,445 --> 01:08:51,756
"Chapter four, you break up
Won't you give it one more chance?"

921
01:08:51,846 --> 01:08:54,121
I'm thinking, "Did we break up?"

922
01:08:55,126 --> 01:08:56,479
Did we break up?

923
01:08:56,565 --> 01:08:59,364
Because if we did
I don't even know about it.

924
01:08:59,445 --> 01:09:03,757
Did that Maynard G. Beatnik
give you what you wanted?

925
01:09:03,846 --> 01:09:06,076
You know, I hate your sarcasm.

926
01:09:07,086 --> 01:09:09,395
You're going to blow it, Peggy Sue.

927
01:09:09,766 --> 01:09:12,724
No one treats Charlie Bodell like this.

928
01:09:13,166 --> 01:09:16,875
Why do you talk about yourself in the third
person like you were Napoleon?

929
01:09:16,966 --> 01:09:20,878
- Why is everything an argument with you?
- Look! I've got the hair.

930
01:09:20,966 --> 01:09:23,958
I've got the teeth. I've got the eyes.

931
01:09:24,246 --> 01:09:28,637
Peggy, look outside that window.
I've got the car. I'm the lead singer.

932
01:09:29,246 --> 01:09:33,842
I'm the man.
Why are you arguing with me?

933
01:09:33,926 --> 01:09:38,078
It's over, Charlie. I don't want to hurt you.

934
01:09:38,326 --> 01:09:40,078
I want you to be happy.

935
01:09:40,246 --> 01:09:43,443
But, no. I will be happy if I have you.

936
01:09:44,206 --> 01:09:45,161
I love you.

937
01:09:45,246 --> 01:09:47,840
No! That doesn't make any difference.

938
01:09:47,966 --> 01:09:49,797
We just can't live together.

939
01:09:49,886 --> 01:09:52,036
And you went off with that bimbo Janet.

940
01:09:52,126 --> 01:09:54,242
What are you talking about?

941
01:09:54,485 --> 01:09:55,680
Who is Janet?

942
01:09:55,766 --> 01:09:58,199
- I don't know any Janet.
- I just can't trust you!

943
01:09:58,286 --> 01:10:01,596
But what about everything
I said to you this afternoon?

944
01:10:01,686 --> 01:10:03,596
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

945
01:10:03,686 --> 01:10:08,043
I have this window in my heart
and anytime you want, you can crawl in.

946
01:10:08,126 --> 01:10:10,686
I got to close it
or nothing's going to be different.

947
01:10:10,766 --> 01:10:12,916
- What has to be different?
- Everything!

948
01:10:13,006 --> 01:10:17,284
You know it's not going to work like this.
You have to go to college and finish.

949
01:10:17,365 --> 01:10:20,163
What about the group
and my singing career?

950
01:10:20,246 --> 01:10:21,725
What about me?

951
01:10:22,126 --> 01:10:27,199
I am trying to save you years of frustration
of waiting for...

952
01:10:27,286 --> 01:10:28,798
...that big break. No.

953
01:10:28,886 --> 01:10:32,798
That big disappointment so you can
blame me for the rest of your life.

954
01:10:32,886 --> 01:10:34,637
You don't know zip.

955
01:10:35,246 --> 01:10:39,478
You think I'm going to spend
the rest of my life selling appliances?

956
01:10:39,565 --> 01:10:42,557
Chasing women around the store
like my father?

957
01:10:43,525 --> 01:10:45,596
I've got to give it a shot.

958
01:10:46,686 --> 01:10:49,279
What the hell has changed, Peggy Sue?

959
01:10:49,726 --> 01:10:52,762
Until yesterday you loved me
and you loved us.

960
01:10:55,726 --> 01:10:59,514
For two years,
I've done nothing but love you.

961
01:11:01,405 --> 01:11:04,556
All right, I'll prove it to you. I'll show you.

962
01:11:04,646 --> 01:11:06,876
I'm going to be just like Fabian.

963
01:12:09,605 --> 01:12:10,925
Let's sit there.

964
01:12:11,246 --> 01:12:12,474
Sure.

965
01:12:25,046 --> 01:12:26,364
This is great.

966
01:12:29,525 --> 01:12:31,038
Okay, here we go.

967
01:12:31,126 --> 01:12:33,117
- Suds for you.
- Thank you.

968
01:12:33,206 --> 01:12:35,037
And a whiskey for you.

969
01:12:41,966 --> 01:12:44,002
Five more weeks of school.

970
01:12:44,365 --> 01:12:49,042
Ten minutes past graduation, I'm gone!
To freedom!

971
01:12:49,846 --> 01:12:51,279
For everyone.

972
01:12:52,806 --> 01:12:54,444
Now, this is the plan.

973
01:12:54,525 --> 01:12:57,404
As soon as school is finished,
we move to Utah.

974
01:12:57,926 --> 01:12:59,041
Utah?

975
01:13:00,246 --> 01:13:02,840
I thought you'd be going to Paris
or New York.

976
01:13:02,926 --> 01:13:04,041
What's in Utah?

977
01:13:04,126 --> 01:13:08,677
Rita. I met her last summer. She's cool.
You'll really dig her.

978
01:13:09,046 --> 01:13:13,801
She's got this little cabin outside the hills
of Provo where she raises chickens.

979
01:13:14,126 --> 01:13:17,913
I'll write, and you two can take care
of the chickens to support us.

980
01:13:18,286 --> 01:13:21,005
- I can't do that.
- Why not?

981
01:13:21,206 --> 01:13:22,923
Polygamy's legal in Utah.

982
01:13:24,206 --> 01:13:26,037
I'm allergic to chickens.

983
01:13:31,766 --> 01:13:34,917
Wait. What about the other night?

984
01:13:35,726 --> 01:13:38,877
We were like two stars
in the same constellation.

985
01:13:40,286 --> 01:13:44,962
Michael, you and I are light-years apart.
You should go, but not with me.

986
01:13:45,046 --> 01:13:49,756
But we had heat, baby. Passion! Fire!

987
01:13:50,686 --> 01:13:53,802
We owe it to ourselves to fuse together.

988
01:13:54,846 --> 01:13:56,757
At least one more time.

989
01:13:57,686 --> 01:14:00,996
That's a great line.
You are going to be a terrific writer.

990
01:14:03,006 --> 01:14:05,679
- You think so?
- Yeah.

991
01:14:06,686 --> 01:14:11,680
Michael,
we had one glorious night together.

992
01:14:12,365 --> 01:14:15,199
Someday you'll remember
and write about it.

993
01:14:17,405 --> 01:14:18,521
Yeah.

994
01:14:20,126 --> 01:14:21,114
I can dig that.

995
01:14:23,246 --> 01:14:25,157
Bittersweet perfection.

996
01:14:25,926 --> 01:14:30,158
Dogs of lust on leashes of memory. Yes!

997
01:14:33,166 --> 01:14:34,599
It's Charlie.

998
01:14:35,046 --> 01:14:36,479
What a treat.

999
01:14:39,926 --> 01:14:41,074
Now I get it.

1000
01:14:41,686 --> 01:14:43,085
It's great.

1001
01:14:44,445 --> 01:14:47,643
Peggy Sue's still stuck on
"Treble Without a Cause."

1002
01:14:48,206 --> 01:14:50,117
Come on, I want to dance.

1003
01:15:10,046 --> 01:15:12,560
I thought I knew everything about him.

1004
01:15:12,886 --> 01:15:14,399
Can we split now?

1005
01:15:42,605 --> 01:15:43,925
Thank you.

1006
01:15:46,886 --> 01:15:49,081
So, Mr. Wilkins, new client?

1007
01:15:50,286 --> 01:15:51,958
I'm sorry, Charlie.

1008
01:15:55,445 --> 01:15:57,516
I don't think so, you know.

1009
01:15:58,846 --> 01:16:01,041
It happens, but not with you.

1010
01:16:01,326 --> 01:16:02,884
Believe me when I tell you.

1011
01:16:02,966 --> 01:16:05,525
Maybe it's the material.
But it can't happen.

1012
01:16:29,166 --> 01:16:30,394
Good morning.

1013
01:16:33,405 --> 01:16:34,838
Charlie?

1014
01:16:43,926 --> 01:16:45,882
What are you doing here?

1015
01:16:46,326 --> 01:16:48,282
I wanted to talk to you.

1016
01:16:48,726 --> 01:16:52,162
I've got one last thing
I have to do at school and then...

1017
01:16:53,286 --> 01:16:56,561
Elvis. Hi. How are you? Hi, guy.

1018
01:16:56,646 --> 01:16:58,716
Elvis is dead. That's Ajax.

1019
01:17:01,485 --> 01:17:03,636
I guess I always liked Elvis.

1020
01:17:04,485 --> 01:17:06,875
- Can I have a ride to school?
- No.

1021
01:17:07,246 --> 01:17:10,761
- Why?
- The tiger's out of commission for a while.

1022
01:17:11,006 --> 01:17:12,041
Come on.

1023
01:17:12,286 --> 01:17:16,324
- How about a walk, Charlie Bell?
- How did you know about that?

1024
01:17:16,485 --> 01:17:18,875
I was at Lena's last night.
I heard you sing.

1025
01:17:18,966 --> 01:17:20,604
I thought you were terrific.

1026
01:17:20,686 --> 01:17:23,279
Not terrific enough.
What were you doing there?

1027
01:17:23,365 --> 01:17:26,085
- Who were you with?
- Well, what were you doing there?

1028
01:17:26,166 --> 01:17:28,360
You never told me you sang
with an R & B group.

1029
01:17:28,445 --> 01:17:32,324
There's not a whole heck of a lot
we know about each other, Peggy.

1030
01:17:33,646 --> 01:17:37,878
- I forgot how much music meant to you.
- That's real big of you.

1031
01:17:38,326 --> 01:17:40,556
Stop being so defensive. Here.

1032
01:17:41,686 --> 01:17:43,596
I wrote a song for you.

1033
01:17:45,286 --> 01:17:48,914
- Why did you write me a song?
- Because I want to help you.

1034
01:17:50,445 --> 01:17:54,279
- It'll be a hit. I promise.
- Come on! Stop being sarcastic.

1035
01:17:54,886 --> 01:17:57,559
Lee Wilkins came to hear me last night.

1036
01:17:57,806 --> 01:18:00,400
He told me to forget it.

1037
01:18:02,365 --> 01:18:04,436
Would you just take a look at it?

1038
01:18:04,886 --> 01:18:07,036
Come on. I wrote it for you.

1039
01:18:08,006 --> 01:18:11,282
Well, if you wrote it I guess I'll look at it.

1040
01:18:13,886 --> 01:18:17,355
Listen, about the other night,
I feel so stupid.

1041
01:18:18,445 --> 01:18:22,837
I'm beginning to think that maybe
there is more to life than just music.

1042
01:18:24,686 --> 01:18:29,077
Do you think the world would still like me
if I stopped being Mr. Excitement?

1043
01:18:32,046 --> 01:18:33,161
Yeah.

1044
01:18:35,206 --> 01:18:37,400
Do you want to walk to school?

1045
01:18:38,046 --> 01:18:40,195
Okay, I'll just put the dog inside.

1046
01:18:40,846 --> 01:18:42,119
Come on, Ajax.

1047
01:18:45,846 --> 01:18:48,644
What's the matter, princess?
Lost your prince?

1048
01:18:49,966 --> 01:18:53,675
Delores, there are a lot of things
I could say to you...

1049
01:18:53,846 --> 01:18:56,235
...but you're just not worth the effort.

1050
01:18:57,525 --> 01:19:02,122
- I'm so sorry. These pens are so tricky, I...
- You did that on purpose!

1051
01:19:02,766 --> 01:19:06,315
I hate you! Go stuff your bra!

1052
01:19:07,046 --> 01:19:10,721
- I beg your pardon?
- Take a long walk on a short pier.

1053
01:19:11,166 --> 01:19:12,757
Have a nice day.

1054
01:19:25,886 --> 01:19:29,925
You know, Peggy, there are so many things
to look forward to in the future.

1055
01:19:34,086 --> 01:19:35,997
I came to say good-bye, Richard.

1056
01:19:36,086 --> 01:19:39,283
Good-bye? Wait a minute. Sit down.

1057
01:19:40,846 --> 01:19:45,283
Good-bye? Where are you going?
Peggy, we have a partnership here.

1058
01:19:45,365 --> 01:19:48,914
- I'm making progress on that microchip.
- Well, you were meant to.

1059
01:19:49,006 --> 01:19:51,520
You're one of the people
good things happen to.

1060
01:19:51,605 --> 01:19:52,754
So are you.

1061
01:19:53,086 --> 01:19:55,963
- You have a vision, Peggy.
- A vision?

1062
01:19:57,006 --> 01:19:59,075
I am a walking anachronism!

1063
01:20:00,086 --> 01:20:03,316
I've upset my parents. I miss my kids.

1064
01:20:03,605 --> 01:20:07,360
I could be trapped here forever.
And poor Charlie.

1065
01:20:07,525 --> 01:20:11,360
I got pregnant when I was 18.
That was why we had to get married.

1066
01:20:11,806 --> 01:20:13,319
Tomorrow's my birthday.

1067
01:20:13,405 --> 01:20:16,921
- I have to get out of here.
- You broke up with Charlie?

1068
01:20:18,006 --> 01:20:20,395
Yeah. I know it's a gamble.

1069
01:20:21,125 --> 01:20:23,480
I've loved him for a long, long time.

1070
01:20:23,605 --> 01:20:26,722
Okay. Then let's do something
really visionary.

1071
01:20:27,006 --> 01:20:29,280
Change your destiny, Peggy Sue.

1072
01:20:29,926 --> 01:20:33,281
Change your destiny and marry me.

1073
01:20:34,926 --> 01:20:39,396
No! Peggy Sue got married.

1074
01:20:39,926 --> 01:20:41,324
Case closed.

1075
01:20:42,046 --> 01:20:44,640
I don't want to marry anyone, Richard.

1076
01:20:45,165 --> 01:20:46,154
Good-bye.

1077
01:20:46,445 --> 01:20:48,834
Wait! Peggy, please. Can I go with you?

1078
01:20:48,926 --> 01:20:52,077
No! You have to be valedictorian.

1079
01:20:59,006 --> 01:21:00,997
Peggy Sue, wait a minute!

1080
01:21:01,445 --> 01:21:04,756
Listen, I cut shop
and I did some work on your song.

1081
01:21:05,686 --> 01:21:08,119
You know, it's not half bad
for your first try.

1082
01:21:08,205 --> 01:21:11,278
I changed all the "yeahs" to "oohs,"
but listen to this:

1083
01:21:11,365 --> 01:21:14,756
"She loves you, ooh, ooh, ooh
You love me, ooh, ooh, ooh"

1084
01:21:16,405 --> 01:21:17,555
I got to go.

1085
01:21:17,646 --> 01:21:21,160
About your birthday.
I made reservations at Chez Trev.

1086
01:21:21,525 --> 01:21:24,404
I thought it would be great to eat
at a nice restaurant.

1087
01:21:24,485 --> 01:21:26,078
I won't be here.

1088
01:21:26,565 --> 01:21:29,717
- Why?
- I want to go see my grandparents.

1089
01:21:30,766 --> 01:21:32,404
Good-bye, Charlie.

1090
01:21:33,285 --> 01:21:35,753
I cancelled the tickets for Fabian.

1091
01:22:22,046 --> 01:22:23,114
Close that.

1092
01:22:23,205 --> 01:22:24,923
- There you are.
- Thank you.

1093
01:22:26,846 --> 01:22:30,475
Look! Oh, it's so beautiful.

1094
01:23:03,966 --> 01:23:07,321
What's the matter, Peggy?
Someone jump on your grave?

1095
01:23:14,605 --> 01:23:18,440
You know, Peggy, your mother said
you had a dream that I died.

1096
01:23:19,245 --> 01:23:21,077
I wish she hadn't have told you that.

1097
01:23:21,165 --> 01:23:24,954
I'm not afraid.
I know exactly when I'm going to die.

1098
01:23:25,046 --> 01:23:28,561
What's it going to be, Lizzy?
Seventy-five or eighty?

1099
01:23:29,565 --> 01:23:31,158
I'm not telling!

1100
01:23:31,245 --> 01:23:34,123
I've been trying to drag
that out of her for years.

1101
01:23:34,285 --> 01:23:37,083
You know,
dreams are a fascinating business.

1102
01:23:37,205 --> 01:23:41,199
- Especially when you see the future.
- Do you believe all this?

1103
01:23:41,525 --> 01:23:45,598
Well, I like to speculate.
Like this book I'm reading right now.

1104
01:23:45,686 --> 01:23:50,680
It's about a woman in Colorado who says
she lived in Ireland 150 years ago.

1105
01:23:51,365 --> 01:23:54,199
She gives names,
dates and where she lived.

1106
01:23:55,525 --> 01:23:57,163
Grandma. Grandpa.

1107
01:23:59,165 --> 01:24:01,235
I want to tell you something.

1108
01:24:05,686 --> 01:24:09,395
If you believe it, darling, then I believe.

1109
01:24:10,405 --> 01:24:13,397
Being young is just as confusing
as being old.

1110
01:24:14,565 --> 01:24:17,079
The things that happened to me
50 years ago...

1111
01:24:17,165 --> 01:24:20,316
...are more on my mind
than the things that happen today.

1112
01:24:21,285 --> 01:24:23,561
But I'm remembering the future.

1113
01:24:25,325 --> 01:24:27,281
A chilling wind tonight.

1114
01:24:28,886 --> 01:24:30,524
It's really picking up.

1115
01:24:30,605 --> 01:24:34,154
Right now,
you're just browsing through time.

1116
01:24:36,165 --> 01:24:38,759
Choose the things you'll be proud of.

1117
01:24:39,205 --> 01:24:40,843
Things that last.

1118
01:24:41,886 --> 01:24:43,877
I'm proud of my children.

1119
01:24:44,285 --> 01:24:46,038
I miss them so much.

1120
01:24:46,485 --> 01:24:49,159
Scott and Beth.

1121
01:24:50,646 --> 01:24:52,556
I named my daughter after you.

1122
01:24:55,086 --> 01:24:58,476
Sweetheart, thank you.

1123
01:25:04,766 --> 01:25:05,994
Grandpa.

1124
01:25:09,006 --> 01:25:11,883
When you and Grandma are gone,
the family's gone.

1125
01:25:11,966 --> 01:25:13,957
And I'll never see the cousins anymore.

1126
01:25:14,046 --> 01:25:17,833
It's your grandma's strudel
that's kept this family together.

1127
01:25:18,125 --> 01:25:22,244
If you could do it all again, Grandpa,
what would you do different?

1128
01:25:22,846 --> 01:25:25,519
I'd have taken better care of my teeth.

1129
01:25:26,245 --> 01:25:29,283
Now what's Peggy Sue going to do
at your lodge meeting?

1130
01:25:30,525 --> 01:25:33,437
It's her 18th birthday
and I want to show her off.

1131
01:25:33,605 --> 01:25:37,154
It was my idea, Grandma.
I wondered about those lodge meetings.

1132
01:25:37,245 --> 01:25:39,601
He won't tell me.
But I have my suspicions.

1133
01:25:39,686 --> 01:25:41,915
I don't want to know.
Have a good time, darling.

1134
01:25:42,006 --> 01:25:43,324
All right.

1135
01:25:45,205 --> 01:25:47,515
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye, darling.

1136
01:25:48,966 --> 01:25:50,194
Grandpa?

1137
01:25:50,525 --> 01:25:53,244
What does Grandma think you do
at these meetings?

1138
01:25:53,325 --> 01:25:55,156
Stag movies and poker.

1139
01:26:01,405 --> 01:26:04,875
I may be an old fool,
but I think I can help you.

1140
01:26:06,445 --> 01:26:09,324
At least I got to see you
and Grandma again.

1141
01:26:10,205 --> 01:26:12,355
Has this ever worked before?

1142
01:26:12,485 --> 01:26:17,275
The last time was 600 years ago.
And it's about time for another one.

1143
01:26:44,165 --> 01:26:46,281
Welcome, Peggy Sue!

1144
01:26:46,766 --> 01:26:49,837
Peggy Sue! Welcome, Peggy Sue!

1145
01:26:49,966 --> 01:26:52,843
- It's so wonderful to have you here with us.
- Thank you.

1146
01:26:52,926 --> 01:26:56,521
You've come to the right place.
Our lodge was founded by a time traveller.

1147
01:26:56,605 --> 01:26:59,039
- We're going to send you back home.
- That's right!

1148
01:26:59,125 --> 01:27:01,320
You know, this is very exciting for all of us.

1149
01:27:01,405 --> 01:27:05,637
You know, we've waited a long time
to find a girl like you.

1150
01:27:05,766 --> 01:27:06,834
Yes!

1151
01:27:06,926 --> 01:27:10,838
Grandpa! Do you have to wear that hat?

1152
01:27:11,205 --> 01:27:12,843
Wouldn't be a lodge without hats.

1153
01:28:07,325 --> 01:28:09,123
"Lord of the universe.

1154
01:28:10,165 --> 01:28:11,918
"Vast and mighty one.

1155
01:28:12,686 --> 01:28:14,199
"Ruler of light.

1156
01:28:15,245 --> 01:28:16,837
"King of the sun.

1157
01:28:17,125 --> 01:28:20,038
"This girl is lost amid your mysteries...

1158
01:28:20,125 --> 01:28:22,765
"...and wishes to return to her own time.

1159
01:28:23,205 --> 01:28:26,198
"We adore thee and invoke thee!

1160
01:28:26,605 --> 01:28:28,198
"Grant thine aid.

1161
01:28:28,726 --> 01:28:33,516
"Look with favour upon us
as we witness the regeneration of spirit.

1162
01:28:35,285 --> 01:28:37,038
"We ask thy intervention...

1163
01:28:37,125 --> 01:28:42,074
"...that this girl may return to thee
on the wings of thy love."

1164
01:28:43,926 --> 01:28:48,204
"Womb of the mother,
reclaim thy child of light."

1165
01:28:48,766 --> 01:28:51,154
"The name of your love is rebirth."

1166
01:28:51,605 --> 01:28:54,484
- This is never going to work.
- It's going to work!

1167
01:28:54,565 --> 01:28:57,364
"Reclaim thy child of light."

1168
01:28:57,445 --> 01:29:02,440
"We offer up this girl
that her soul may find its home."

1169
01:29:10,766 --> 01:29:15,521
It's nothing to worry about.
Somebody get the lights.

1170
01:29:17,245 --> 01:29:19,601
Somebody get the lights!

1171
01:29:22,525 --> 01:29:23,561
She's gone!

1172
01:29:25,846 --> 01:29:28,279
What the hell do you think you're doing?

1173
01:29:28,726 --> 01:29:31,717
I'm saving you!
They were going to vaporise you!

1174
01:29:31,806 --> 01:29:36,163
Don't be ridiculous! They're harmless
old men! My grandfather was in there!

1175
01:29:36,245 --> 01:29:38,713
- Get in the car!
- I'm not getting in this monstrosity!

1176
01:29:39,006 --> 01:29:40,837
Well, the girl's gone.

1177
01:29:41,125 --> 01:29:42,763
Let's play cards.

1178
01:29:54,886 --> 01:29:58,400
I've got good news.
Now sit down right here.

1179
01:29:58,726 --> 01:30:00,239
You've got two minutes!

1180
01:30:00,325 --> 01:30:03,159
I told my father
that I'm going to quit singing.

1181
01:30:03,245 --> 01:30:07,034
And he gave me 10 percent
of the business right now!

1182
01:30:07,125 --> 01:30:10,641
- What are you talking about?
- I know what you've been going through.

1183
01:30:10,726 --> 01:30:12,762
You were just scared.

1184
01:30:12,926 --> 01:30:16,601
But you don't have to be scared anymore.
I can support you now.

1185
01:30:16,686 --> 01:30:18,836
- Shit!
- Peggy Sue?

1186
01:30:20,086 --> 01:30:21,803
Will you marry me?

1187
01:30:21,886 --> 01:30:24,115
How can you know
what I've been going through?

1188
01:30:24,205 --> 01:30:27,516
Of course I'm scared!
I can't change anything.

1189
01:30:27,605 --> 01:30:29,961
- I can't help anybody.
- You're not listening to me.

1190
01:30:30,046 --> 01:30:32,400
- I'm proposing to you now.
- You betrayed me.

1191
01:30:32,485 --> 01:30:34,681
You were never there for me
and the children.

1192
01:30:34,766 --> 01:30:38,678
I'll be there for the children.
I'll forget Walter.

1193
01:30:39,125 --> 01:30:42,641
Forget the group. I want to marry you!

1194
01:30:42,886 --> 01:30:44,034
Don't be crazy.

1195
01:30:44,125 --> 01:30:47,879
I may be crazy, but I'm not crazy enough
to marry you twice.

1196
01:30:49,726 --> 01:30:50,999
Christ.

1197
01:30:52,726 --> 01:30:53,954
Peggy.

1198
01:30:57,205 --> 01:30:58,605
I'm sorry.

1199
01:31:02,525 --> 01:31:06,074
I thought I was what you wanted me to be.

1200
01:31:07,565 --> 01:31:09,238
It's all my fault.

1201
01:31:14,565 --> 01:31:15,681
Here.

1202
01:31:17,086 --> 01:31:19,042
It's a birthday present.

1203
01:31:20,525 --> 01:31:23,279
I'm tired of being the romantic fool.

1204
01:31:24,686 --> 01:31:26,802
I'm going to go save my car.

1205
01:31:28,285 --> 01:31:29,513
Charlie?

1206
01:31:32,846 --> 01:31:34,324
It opens, too.

1207
01:31:34,806 --> 01:31:36,204
Look inside.

1208
01:31:42,086 --> 01:31:45,396
Scott and Beth. Where did you get this?

1209
01:31:45,926 --> 01:31:47,837
Who are Scott and Beth?

1210
01:31:49,006 --> 01:31:51,360
Your mother gave me those.
It's you and me.

1211
01:31:51,445 --> 01:31:52,924
You know that.

1212
01:31:54,926 --> 01:31:58,680
So are they.

1213
01:31:59,966 --> 01:32:01,637
I do love you.

1214
01:32:02,285 --> 01:32:03,638
I love you.

1215
01:32:06,766 --> 01:32:08,757
This is right, Peggy Sue.

1216
01:32:10,766 --> 01:32:12,802
I want this to be forever.

1217
01:32:20,766 --> 01:32:22,517
Mom, can you hear me?

1218
01:32:24,806 --> 01:32:26,682
Please, Mom, can you hear me?

1219
01:32:26,766 --> 01:32:28,642
They call what happened a near-death...

1220
01:32:28,726 --> 01:32:31,285
...but we figured out
exactly what the problem is...

1221
01:32:31,365 --> 01:32:33,356
You are a very lucky young lady!

1222
01:32:33,525 --> 01:32:36,597
What happened to you, Peggy Sue,
was a very rare problem...

1223
01:32:36,686 --> 01:32:38,437
...with the rhythm of your heart.

1224
01:32:38,525 --> 01:32:40,004
Mom, do you remember anything?

1225
01:32:40,086 --> 01:32:44,079
In fact, at the party,
they had to do CPR on you...

1226
01:32:45,165 --> 01:32:48,874
...before the paramedics arrived
to give your heart a shock and restart it.

1227
01:32:49,006 --> 01:32:51,042
Dad's been here every day.

1228
01:32:51,365 --> 01:32:53,641
"'Cause I love you, Peggy Sue

1229
01:32:58,565 --> 01:33:02,035
"I love you, girl, and I need you, Peggy"

1230
01:33:09,646 --> 01:33:10,998
Charlie?

1231
01:33:12,405 --> 01:33:16,319
- Was I dead?
- I thought you were for a while.

1232
01:33:18,525 --> 01:33:20,004
You look awful.

1233
01:33:20,525 --> 01:33:23,199
You look like you haven't slept in days.

1234
01:33:24,285 --> 01:33:27,323
- You look so old.
- But happy.

1235
01:33:28,565 --> 01:33:30,636
Very happy, Peggy.

1236
01:33:31,806 --> 01:33:35,082
I thought I knew everything about you.
I'm sorry.

1237
01:33:35,165 --> 01:33:37,202
I wanted to tell you that I...

1238
01:33:37,285 --> 01:33:39,401
- I wanted to...
- I'm sorry.

1239
01:33:39,525 --> 01:33:43,598
I can't live without you.

1240
01:33:46,605 --> 01:33:48,244
What about Janet?

1241
01:33:51,565 --> 01:33:55,400
That's over.
I got tired of translating everything to her.

1242
01:33:55,485 --> 01:33:58,319
She thought the Big Bopper
was a hamburger.

1243
01:34:03,046 --> 01:34:06,038
- Who are all the flowers from?
- Everyone.

1244
01:34:06,646 --> 01:34:10,320
Maddy and Arthur, Carol and Walter...

1245
01:34:11,445 --> 01:34:13,276
...Richard Norvik.

1246
01:34:14,365 --> 01:34:19,120
And here's a book by that guy
in high school, Michael Fitzsimmons.

1247
01:34:20,046 --> 01:34:21,957
He dedicated it to you.

1248
01:34:27,525 --> 01:34:29,801
It couldn't be me. I hardly knew him.

1249
01:34:33,686 --> 01:34:35,915
I'll just set this right here.

1250
01:34:40,485 --> 01:34:42,716
I had a strange experience.

1251
01:34:43,926 --> 01:34:47,759
I went back to high school
and I spent a lot of time with you.

1252
01:34:49,125 --> 01:34:53,482
You and Walter and Leon were singing
I Wonder Why.

1253
01:34:54,125 --> 01:34:55,638
God! Dion!

1254
01:34:56,285 --> 01:34:57,958
You were terrific.

1255
01:34:59,285 --> 01:35:02,083
And I kept trying to push you away.

1256
01:35:03,365 --> 01:35:06,482
- But you wouldn't give up.
- I'll never give up.

1257
01:35:08,285 --> 01:35:09,958
Would you hold me?

1258
01:35:14,245 --> 01:35:19,274
I don't expect that all our problems
can just vanish.

1259
01:35:21,966 --> 01:35:25,845
Christ, I would cut my right arm off
for another chance.

1260
01:35:25,926 --> 01:35:29,555
No, please, I need some time.

1261
01:35:41,766 --> 01:35:44,154
Well, I'll let you get some rest.

1262
01:35:54,405 --> 01:35:58,364
I'd like to invite you over to our house
for dinner on Sunday.

1263
01:35:59,086 --> 01:36:00,598
With your kids.

1264
01:36:04,125 --> 01:36:05,797
I'll make a strudel.
