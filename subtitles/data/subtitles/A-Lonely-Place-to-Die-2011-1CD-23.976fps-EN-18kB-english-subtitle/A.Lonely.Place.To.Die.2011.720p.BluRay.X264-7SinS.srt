1
00:01:37,293 --> 00:01:38,953
Safe!

2
00:01:45,426 --> 00:01:46,541
Off belay!

3
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:53,632
Right, can you get my camera out,
please?

4
00:01:59,565 --> 00:02:01,439
<i>Say it.</i>

5
00:02:02,443 --> 00:02:04,186
- Come on.
- Don't take a picture.

6
00:02:04,278 --> 00:02:08,406
Give us a smile. I'm sure there's a
pretty face under that frown somewhere.

7
00:02:12,952 --> 00:02:15,989
- Is that the best you got?
- Afraid so.

8
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,654
- OK, get one of me.
- No, I'll take it at the top.

9
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,241
Yeah, but I wanna get
some of this background in.

10
00:02:21,336 --> 00:02:22,711
Pass it over.

11
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:28,257
Try and get some of that exposure in.
Show how high up we are.

12
00:02:28,343 --> 00:02:30,216
Is that a golden eagle?

13
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,934
<i>Beautiful.</i>

14
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,345
It's a golden eagle.
Buzzard. I don't know

15
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:43,764
<i>Nah, it's way too big to be a buzzard.</i>

16
00:02:51,657 --> 00:02:55,322
Alright, that's enough of the bird.
Point the camera at the money.

17
00:02:56,329 --> 00:02:57,823
Alison, come on.

18
00:02:59,498 --> 00:03:01,408
- Stop pouting.
- What?

19
00:03:02,835 --> 00:03:04,626
<i>It was a golden eagle.</i>

20
00:03:49,838 --> 00:03:52,543
- Alison! Help me!
- Ed!

21
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:56,093
<i>Jesus Christ, Alison!</i>

22
00:03:56,762 --> 00:03:58,920
<i>- Shit!
- Rob, throw the rope.</i>

23
00:03:59,014 --> 00:04:00,093
<i>- Guys!
- Alison!</i>

24
00:04:00,182 --> 00:04:04,475
<i>- Ed!
- Alison, please! It's slipping!</i>

25
00:04:04,561 --> 00:04:06,221
<i>It's gonna go!</i>

26
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:15,146
<i>I can't... I can't...
I can't get up!</i>

27
00:04:18,116 --> 00:04:19,943
<i>- Help me!
- Rob!</i>

28
00:04:21,286 --> 00:04:22,531
Rob!

29
00:04:26,206 --> 00:04:29,622
<i>Ed, just breathe!</i>

30
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:32,201
<i>- It's not gonna hold!
- Ed! Ed!</i>

31
00:04:32,296 --> 00:04:34,917
Ed, you have to listen to me.
Just breathe.

32
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:54,442
<i>It's OK, but stop moving.
Keep it together.</i>

33
00:04:54,526 --> 00:04:55,855
<i>Alright, alright.</i>

34
00:04:55,944 --> 00:04:58,186
Easy. OK, OK. Get your breath.

35
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,150
Get your breath.
Jesus Christ, what happened, guys?

36
00:05:02,826 --> 00:05:05,862
- Alison, are you alright?
- Don't ask. Yeah, I'm fine.

37
00:05:05,954 --> 00:05:09,655
<i>Alright, mate, you're alright.
OK. Can you just pull yourself up?</i>

38
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,789
<i>- Thank God.
- Alison, you OK?</i>

39
00:05:11,877 --> 00:05:13,786
<i>- I'm fine.
- Alright.</i>

40
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:16,666
It's OK, keep going.
Just get your breath.

Don't ever have a concentration lapse
like that again, OK?

64
00:08:17,682 --> 00:08:20,303
You wanna climb with me,
you need to up your game.

Methodical, every step. I mean it.

66
00:08:23,229 --> 00:08:26,313
Complacency is a killer out here.

67
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:28,806
- We got away with cuts and bruises.
- Yeah.

68
00:08:31,404 --> 00:08:33,859
Remind me why we do this again.

69
00:08:34,782 --> 00:08:36,573
Because we don't surf.

70
00:08:56,886 --> 00:08:58,262
<i>- Hey.
- Hey.</i>

71
00:08:58,346 --> 00:09:01,133
- Hey.
- Hey. How you doing, honey?

72
00:09:03,017 --> 00:09:07,395
<i>- What time did you get here?
- About an hour ago. Just unpacking.</i>

73
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:12,264
Yeah, we took the double room
with the en suite. If that's OK?

74
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,353
Fine. I'm not sleeping with him, am I?

75
00:09:15,446 --> 00:09:16,905
Neither am I.

76
00:09:19,117 --> 00:09:21,156
<i>I'm Ed, by the way.</i>

77
00:09:21,244 --> 00:09:24,161
Oh, Ed. I'm sorry, mate.
Ed, Jenny. Jenny, this is Ed.

78
00:09:24,247 --> 00:09:25,278
Hi, Ed.

79
00:09:33,881 --> 00:09:35,459
No, after you.

80
00:09:38,761 --> 00:09:40,172
<i>OK?</i>

81
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,758
Oh, right.

82
00:09:46,644 --> 00:09:49,680
Oh, honey, can you bring me
the cutlery, please, babe?

83
00:09:49,772 --> 00:09:51,599
It's in the jug on the dresser.

84
00:09:52,608 --> 00:09:54,517
Smells like someone's died in here.

85
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:57,943
Yeah, it is a little stinky.
I'll open a window, let some air in.

86
00:09:58,989 --> 00:10:01,277
That's just what Fred West
would have said.

87
00:10:01,366 --> 00:10:04,071
In future, you should
bury your relatives outdoors.

88
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,489
Think patio.

89
00:10:05,578 --> 00:10:09,493
If we had a phone in here, mate, you
could call up the landlord and complain.

90
00:10:09,582 --> 00:10:11,741
- There's no phone?
- No.

91
00:10:11,835 --> 00:10:13,080
Great.

92
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:19,045
And the window... is bust.

93
00:10:22,762 --> 00:10:25,004
Any joy?

94
00:10:25,098 --> 00:10:27,137
We've had a right result.

95
00:11:00,258 --> 00:11:02,464
Hey, don't worry about her.

96
00:11:03,344 --> 00:11:07,672
You know, with a bit of luck, she'll be
tucked up and fast asleep by now.

97
00:11:08,348 --> 00:11:10,804
Your parents are such a pushover.

98
00:11:10,892 --> 00:11:13,976
She runs rings round them.
She's such a little monkey.

99
00:11:16,189 --> 00:11:17,517
I miss her.

100
00:11:18,441 --> 00:11:20,600
It's only been two days, Jen.

101
00:11:21,611 --> 00:11:22,774
Hmm.

102
00:11:41,881 --> 00:11:43,257
Bollocks.

103
00:12:05,571 --> 00:12:07,315
<i># You take the high road</i>

106
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:18,412
It's horrible. Girls, girls, stop.
Seriously, it's horrible.

107
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,750
<i>- Please, cards, go.
- OK. OK.</i>

108
00:12:21,835 --> 00:12:23,211
But, erm...

109
00:12:23,295 --> 00:12:26,545
Right, I need to know how much
one of these fellas is worth.

110
00:12:26,632 --> 00:12:28,292
Five matchsticks. Er!

111
00:12:28,384 --> 00:12:32,428
<i>Er, no sex for you.</i>

112
00:12:32,513 --> 00:12:36,973
<i>- And, OK, a bottle top?
- Two pasta swirls to a top.</i>

113
00:12:37,851 --> 00:12:42,145
Right. So then, ten matchsticks
makes one bottle top?

114
00:12:42,231 --> 00:12:43,855
<i>Yeah.</i>

115
00:12:43,941 --> 00:12:47,641
Great. OK, thanks, guys.
It's a bit confusing, is all.

116
00:12:47,736 --> 00:12:49,645
It really isn't.

117
00:12:49,738 --> 00:12:52,359
<i>- Be nice.
- What are you doing, Jen?</i>

118
00:12:52,491 --> 00:12:54,733
Ladies and gentlemen, I fold.

119
00:12:56,036 --> 00:12:59,286
- What have you got that's so special?
- Erm...

120
00:12:59,373 --> 00:13:02,789
A pasta swirl and two tops
is what I'm gonna raise by.

121
00:13:02,876 --> 00:13:05,035
- I fold.
- Me, too.

122
00:13:06,463 --> 00:13:09,713
I'm gonna keep him honest. All in.

123
00:13:11,677 --> 00:13:14,002
The water's warm. Jump on in.

124
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,054
Yeah, right. Erm, all in.

125
00:13:22,561 --> 00:13:24,637
- Three kings.
- Whoa.

126
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:28,775
- Oh, damn, I've only got three tens.
- A-ha! Get in, yer dancer!

127
00:13:28,859 --> 00:13:32,145
Come here, you lovely, lovely little...

128
00:13:32,238 --> 00:13:34,111
Oh, look at his wee face.

129
00:13:34,198 --> 00:13:36,523
I've got a pair of queens as well,
if that helps.

130
00:13:39,745 --> 00:13:43,956
Oh, come on, sit down, Alex. Shock's
best absorbed with the knees bent.

131
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:47,997
Full house. Let him take it.

132
00:13:48,087 --> 00:13:50,293
Don't spend it all in one pub.

133
00:13:50,881 --> 00:13:53,087
I can retire to the Bahamas
like Roger Moore.

134
00:13:53,175 --> 00:13:55,844
- You mean Sean Connery.
- I'm in the Roger Moore camp.

135
00:13:55,928 --> 00:13:59,593
<i>There's nothing
wrong with a little bit of camp.</i>

136
00:13:59,681 --> 00:14:01,591
That's a horrible impression.

137
00:14:01,683 --> 00:14:03,094
<i>- It isn't.
- It is.</i>

138
00:14:03,185 --> 00:14:04,216
<i>It's not!</i>

139
00:14:08,899 --> 00:14:10,892
Alex, what is this? Where's the Queen?

140
00:14:10,984 --> 00:14:13,356
That's legal tender.
It's a Scottish tenner.

141
00:14:13,445 --> 00:14:16,861
It's worse than Monopoly money.
I can't buy anything with this.

142
00:14:16,949 --> 00:14:19,025
<i>I've only got two words for you.</i>

143
00:14:19,117 --> 00:14:22,533
- Yeah, do they involve sex and travel?
- Possibly.

144
00:14:22,621 --> 00:14:24,115
Well, don't say them.

145
00:14:24,206 --> 00:14:27,289
<i>That's our cue to leave.
Goodnight, everybody.</i>

146
00:14:31,462 --> 00:14:34,416
- Fuck off!
- Leave it. Goodnight!

147
00:14:35,049 --> 00:14:36,626
Another round?

148
00:14:37,426 --> 00:14:40,213
Look, baby, I'm sorry.
I'm pissed. It was just banter.

149
00:14:40,304 --> 00:14:44,005
- Yeah. I know. But it's not very sexy.
- I'm not trying to be sexy.

150
00:14:44,099 --> 00:14:46,555
Why not? You're not on a promise.

151
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:54,860
- Deal.
- Will do.

152
00:14:58,614 --> 00:15:01,235
Stick with me,
we'll climb that this time next year.

153
00:15:01,325 --> 00:15:03,898
The Eiger? Yeah, let's do it.
The north face.

154
00:15:05,621 --> 00:15:07,329
It killed 70 people.

155
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:12,960
<i>If you fall from the summit,
it'll take 30 seconds to hit the ground.</i>

156
00:15:13,462 --> 00:15:16,582
<i>- That's cheery.
- 30 seconds to recall your life,</i>

157
00:15:16,673 --> 00:15:19,129
say your goodbyes,
conscious the whole way down.

158
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:21,376
Just enough time
to say the Lord's Prayer.

159
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:25,847
- If you believe that's gonna save you.
- You're really gonna need something.

160
00:15:30,395 --> 00:15:33,810
- It's blowing a bastard out there.
- Yeah, I know.

161
00:15:33,898 --> 00:15:36,852
It's, er, supposed to clear up
through the night, though.

162
00:15:36,942 --> 00:15:39,184
But tomorrow is gonna be tricky.

163
00:15:40,738 --> 00:15:42,066
Drink?

164
00:15:43,616 --> 00:15:44,695
Fill her up.

165
00:15:44,784 --> 00:15:48,366
- No, you can't mix gin and whisky.
- It's called a gisky.

166
00:15:48,454 --> 00:15:49,829
- Is it?
- I just invented it.

167
00:15:49,914 --> 00:15:51,491
- Right.
- Gisky?

168
00:15:51,624 --> 00:15:55,040
<i>- Gisky. Would you like one?
- No, I'll pass.</i>

169
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:09,712
Alright, folks,
slight change of plan, I think.

170
00:16:09,808 --> 00:16:13,142
There are 40mph winds on that peak,
but they're gusting 60.

171
00:16:13,228 --> 00:16:17,689
It's supposed to die down tonight, so I
think we'll do the west face tomorrow

172
00:16:17,775 --> 00:16:20,147
and just tackle the north ridge today.

173
00:16:20,235 --> 00:16:22,691
It's nothing more than a diff.
You know, V diff.

174
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:26,777
So don't worry about rock shoes, helmets
or anything that'll weigh you down.

175
00:16:26,867 --> 00:16:29,025
We've got a lot of ground to cover.

176
00:16:29,119 --> 00:16:30,827
How's the exposure on the ridge?

177
00:16:30,913 --> 00:16:33,783
A bit thought provoking,
but keep hold of your harness.

178
00:16:33,874 --> 00:16:37,077
- I've got mine and we'll take the rope.
- OK, good.

179
00:16:37,169 --> 00:16:39,207
Got all your gear?
Don't leave anything.

180
00:16:39,295 --> 00:16:42,081
The only thing I left
is for a fully qualified plumber.

181
00:16:42,172 --> 00:16:43,500
Charming.

182
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,084
- Good morning.
- Hey, how's the head?

183
00:16:48,178 --> 00:16:51,381
Two cups of coffee and three aspirin,
I'm almost human again.

184
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:54,429
OK?

185
00:16:54,517 --> 00:16:56,843
So I guess it's a no-go
on the west face, hmm?

186
00:16:56,936 --> 00:17:00,602
No. This isn't Yosemite. The weather
up here does exactly what it wants.

187
00:17:00,732 --> 00:17:02,012
Yeah.

188
00:17:04,652 --> 00:17:07,488
- Got the lunch, Jen?
- Yeah, that's all under control.

189
00:17:07,572 --> 00:17:10,324
- What are we having?
- Sandwiches.

190
00:17:10,408 --> 00:17:14,951
Ah. The pinnacle of British cuisine.
No wonder the French hate us.

191
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:17,908
- I make a pretty good sandwich.
- Well, what's in them?

192
00:17:17,999 --> 00:17:20,455
Just wait and see.
The surprise is half the fun.

193
00:17:20,543 --> 00:17:22,536
Just as long as it's not fish.

194
00:17:24,756 --> 00:17:26,962
<i>You should try one.
They're yummy.</i>

195
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:30,086
<i>Smoked mackerel and egg?
I'd rather eat my own shit.</i>

196
00:17:30,178 --> 00:17:32,336
No one's stopping you.

197
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:36,297
You could always scrape out the mackerel
and just eat the bread.

198
00:17:36,392 --> 00:17:38,966
No, I can't do that. It's been tainted.

199
00:17:39,062 --> 00:17:40,639
You remind me of my daughter.

200
00:17:40,772 --> 00:17:43,144
She's clearly a lady
of impeccable taste.

201
00:17:43,232 --> 00:17:44,430
She's two.

202
00:17:46,485 --> 00:17:49,900
<i>You're such a fussy eater.
It's so surprising at your age.</i>

203
00:17:49,988 --> 00:17:52,609
Surprise is half the fun, right?

204
00:17:52,741 --> 00:17:54,568
Thank fuck I brought chocolate.

205
00:17:54,659 --> 00:17:57,329
Five minutes and we're off.
Everybody OK with that?

206
00:17:57,412 --> 00:17:59,072
Sounds good.

207
00:18:06,921 --> 00:18:08,084
It's beautiful.

208
00:18:09,174 --> 00:18:11,925
I know. Scenery like this
makes me wish I could paint.

209
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:13,255
I'm gonna take a piss.

210
00:18:13,345 --> 00:18:16,429
<i>- Yeah, good to know.
- Thought you might be interested.</i>

211
00:18:16,514 --> 00:18:19,515
No, no, mate, you feel free
to keep us updated at all times.

212
00:18:19,601 --> 00:18:21,059
<i>Will do.</i>

213
00:18:23,229 --> 00:18:27,559
I've found a cracking spot.
I'm unbuttoning my fly.

214
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:32,028
I'm getting it out.
Fucking hell, it weighs a ton.

215
00:18:32,113 --> 00:18:33,488
Shut up, wanker.

216
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,507
Hey, guys! I heard something.

217
00:18:59,598 --> 00:19:01,555
Oh, yeah, what?

218
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:06,102
I dunno. Something.
Come here and check it out.

219
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:08,476
Mate, you think I'm falling for that?

220
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:11,602
I'm serious.

221
00:19:24,873 --> 00:19:26,581
What is it?

222
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:31,119
- What's going on up there?
- Hold on a sec!

223
00:19:32,422 --> 00:19:34,130
Just listen.

224
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:38,254
D'you hear that?

225
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:43,556
I heard it.

226
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:45,681
- What is it then?
- An animal?

227
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:48,436
- No way.
- Then what?

228
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:50,514
- Sounds to me like...
- Like what?

229
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:53,972
A person.

230
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:58,820
- Guys, get over here.
- What is it?

231
00:19:58,905 --> 00:20:00,697
<i>Just get over here.</i>

232
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:18,042
<i>- What is it?
- Shh. Listen.</i>

233
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:27,093
- I hear it.
- Yeah, me too.

234
00:21:23,571 --> 00:21:24,769
<i>What is that?</i>

235
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:26,488
I've no idea.

236
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:35,576
<i>- Shit.
- What?</i>

237
00:21:36,834 --> 00:21:38,957
It's a breathing tube.

238
00:21:40,379 --> 00:21:41,957
There's someone down there.

239
00:21:42,756 --> 00:21:44,215
Just wait here, guys. Wait!

240
00:22:11,618 --> 00:22:13,527
Hello?

241
00:22:13,619 --> 00:22:16,620
<i>Jesus Christ!</i>

242
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:21,834
- Jesus Christ.
- What the hell is that?

243
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,627
Don't you mean who?

244
00:22:27,508 --> 00:22:28,753
<i>What do we do?</i>

245
00:22:30,803 --> 00:22:31,882
Ed.

246
00:22:34,181 --> 00:22:35,925
Wait a sec, guys.

247
00:22:36,434 --> 00:22:38,094
Hello?

248
00:22:41,105 --> 00:22:43,062
If you can hear us, say something!

249
00:22:45,276 --> 00:22:46,390
Oh, Jesus.

250
00:22:47,153 --> 00:22:49,478
This was dug recently.
The earth's still soft.

251
00:22:49,572 --> 00:22:51,315
Why would somebody be down there?

252
00:22:51,407 --> 00:22:54,443
<i>I told you I heard something.</i>

253
00:22:54,535 --> 00:22:57,073
We're gonna help you.
Just sit tight for a moment.

254
00:22:59,415 --> 00:23:02,119
- What are you doing?
- We don't know what's down there.

255
00:23:02,209 --> 00:23:04,285
- It sounds like a child.
- I think so, too.

256
00:23:04,378 --> 00:23:06,335
We can think, but we don't fucking know.

257
00:23:06,422 --> 00:23:08,829
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Guys, it's made of wood.</i>

258
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:13,752
- See if we can find the corners.
- This is insane. What are you doing?

259
00:23:13,846 --> 00:23:16,467
Get down here! Help us.
Fucking kneel down and help.

260
00:23:16,557 --> 00:23:18,797
<i>Come on!</i>

261
00:23:21,144 --> 00:23:24,394
<i>Right, we're gonna try
and lift it, OK? On three.</i>

262
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,185
One, two, three.

263
00:23:30,736 --> 00:23:32,314
<i>Fuck.</i>

264
00:23:32,989 --> 00:23:35,028
<i>- Oh, my God.
- Jesus.</i>

265
00:23:38,786 --> 00:23:40,779
Alright. Hello.

266
00:23:41,747 --> 00:23:45,282
Now don't be afraid. We're gonna get you
out of there. Alright?

267
00:23:45,376 --> 00:23:46,704
Ed?

268
00:23:47,837 --> 00:23:49,746
<i>Come on.</i>

269
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:52,590
No, no, no. Don't worry,
we're not gonna hurt you.

270
00:23:52,675 --> 00:23:55,759
OK, darling? We're not gonna hurt you.
Come on.

271
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,431
For fuck's sake, you're scaring her!
Leave her alone.

272
00:24:02,351 --> 00:24:04,889
It's OK, sweetie.

273
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,764
Alright. Alright.

274
00:24:07,857 --> 00:24:08,888
It's OK.

275
00:24:09,942 --> 00:24:13,275
It's alright. I'm not gonna hurt you.

276
00:24:13,362 --> 00:24:16,446
It's OK.
We're gonna get you out of here.

277
00:24:17,616 --> 00:24:19,276
Come on, sweetie.

278
00:24:19,368 --> 00:24:21,076
It's alright.

279
00:24:22,121 --> 00:24:24,694
It's OK. Good girl. It's OK.

280
00:24:27,625 --> 00:24:29,665
It's OK.

281
00:24:30,545 --> 00:24:33,462
- OK, honey. Help.
- OK.

282
00:24:34,757 --> 00:24:36,002
<i>OK.</i>

283
00:24:36,092 --> 00:24:39,591
Let's get you out of here.
Come up. Come up.

284
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:41,387
Can you get me some water?

285
00:24:45,935 --> 00:24:49,102
Sit down.
It's alright, it's alright. OK.

286
00:24:49,188 --> 00:24:52,889
OK. OK. Here you go. There you go.

287
00:24:54,318 --> 00:24:58,067
Slowly. Drink slowly.
Slowly, slowly, slowly.

288
00:24:58,155 --> 00:25:01,359
Alright. Good girl.

289
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:04,700
Oh. Alright. It's OK.

290
00:25:04,787 --> 00:25:07,657
It's alright, it's alright. It's OK.

291
00:25:10,042 --> 00:25:11,702
Sweetie, can you tell...

292
00:25:13,087 --> 00:25:16,419
Can you tell me your name? Your name?

293
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:20,376
I'm Jenny. Jenny.

294
00:25:21,427 --> 00:25:23,337
What's your name?

295
00:25:23,429 --> 00:25:25,588
- Anna.
- Anna.

296
00:25:26,516 --> 00:25:28,224
OK, Anna.

297
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:32,887
<i>Anna, where are you from?</i>

298
00:25:37,109 --> 00:25:39,315
OK. Alright.

299
00:25:42,489 --> 00:25:45,609
Anna, do you speak English?

300
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:51,371
Anna? English? Does anyone know
what language that is?

301
00:25:51,456 --> 00:25:53,532
I dunno. Is it Russian, maybe?

302
00:25:53,625 --> 00:25:56,792
- Might be Croatian.
- How do you know that?

303
00:25:56,878 --> 00:26:00,543
Well, I had an ex-girlfriend from Zagreb
and she'd swear at me in Croat.

304
00:26:00,632 --> 00:26:03,668
- You're sure that's what it is?
- She used to swear at me a lot.

305
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:07,343
- Can you understand what she's saying?
- No. The accent sounds familiar.

306
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:09,506
Well, do you speak any Croat?

307
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:11,806
I could score an eighth,
ask for a threesome.

308
00:26:11,893 --> 00:26:13,684
- Ah, Jesus.
- Oh, for God's sake.

309
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:16,226
- Dick.
- Sorry.

310
00:26:16,314 --> 00:26:20,643
<i>- Why would someone do this?
- They didn't want her to die.</i>

311
00:26:22,404 --> 00:26:24,941
Otherwise there wouldn't be an air pipe.

312
00:26:25,031 --> 00:26:28,780
<i>I don't want to know who put her
down there or why they did it.</i>

313
00:26:28,868 --> 00:26:31,406
I just want to get out of here
before they come back.

314
00:26:31,496 --> 00:26:33,987
Listen, listen.
She's our responsibility now.

315
00:26:34,123 --> 00:26:36,282
We've got to get help.
We've got to get her

316
00:26:36,876 --> 00:26:38,619
off these mountains soon.

317
00:26:40,295 --> 00:26:46,334
OK. Right, we're here, 12 miles
south-southwest of Alltnacaillich.

318
00:26:46,426 --> 00:26:49,178
The nearest village is Annan Mor, so...

319
00:26:49,262 --> 00:26:51,006
Yeah.

320
00:26:51,098 --> 00:26:54,965
We could go east along the Scimitar
Ridge until we get to the river,

321
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:58,429
then double back to the village.
It's about 15, 20 miles all in.

322
00:26:58,522 --> 00:27:01,725
I found this in the hole.
She must've been down there for days.

323
00:27:01,817 --> 00:27:04,853
- Did she have any food?
- Didn't look like it.

324
00:27:04,945 --> 00:27:08,563
<i>She must have been starving
down there all by herself in the dark.</i>

325
00:27:08,657 --> 00:27:11,195
Let's not kill her with
a smoked mackerel sandwich.

326
00:27:11,284 --> 00:27:13,573
Can we use your phone? Phone for help?

327
00:27:13,662 --> 00:27:15,239
What, in these mountains?

328
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:18,699
Won't get anything approaching
a signal till you get near the A9.

329
00:27:18,792 --> 00:27:20,286
That's about 30 miles away.

330
00:27:20,377 --> 00:27:22,868
You said it was 15 miles to the village.

331
00:27:24,422 --> 00:27:27,838
There is a faster route.
We're only two miles from Devil's Drop.

332
00:27:27,926 --> 00:27:31,295
<i>- What's Devil's Drop?
- The only way to breach the ridge.</i>

333
00:27:31,388 --> 00:27:33,879
It's a sheer cliff face
500 foot straight down,

334
00:27:33,973 --> 00:27:38,185
but from there, it is only
a four-mile hike to Annan Mor.

335
00:27:38,895 --> 00:27:40,935
How do we get a child down Devil's Drop?

336
00:27:41,898 --> 00:27:45,231
We don't. Two of us abseil down
and run to the village for help,

337
00:27:45,317 --> 00:27:48,852
alert the police and get the Highland
Rescue to pick up the rest of you.

338
00:27:48,946 --> 00:27:52,315
- Who are you gonna take with you?
- Alison.

339
00:27:52,407 --> 00:27:55,195
Sorry, Ed, no arguments, mate.
I need the best.

340
00:27:55,285 --> 00:27:59,497
It's a massive face, Rob.
I mean, we don't have enough rope.

341
00:27:59,581 --> 00:28:01,788
I've got 20 metres of seven mil
if that helps.

342
00:28:01,875 --> 00:28:03,619
No, no, you keep that with you.

343
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:07,079
There's some rough terrain.
You might need it. We'll manage.

344
00:28:07,214 --> 00:28:10,630
- We'll multi pitch it. It'll be fine.
- Do you want us to wait here?

345
00:28:10,717 --> 00:28:12,924
No. There's no way we're staying here.

346
00:28:13,011 --> 00:28:17,887
Follow the route on the map. I'll make
sure they get the helicopter out to you.

347
00:28:17,974 --> 00:28:21,011
As long as you stick to that route,
they'll find you easily.

348
00:29:00,724 --> 00:29:03,760
- Yeah, that's it. There it is. See?
- Where?

349
00:29:03,852 --> 00:29:06,604
That's the Haston Step.
It's the first belay point.

350
00:29:17,324 --> 00:29:20,609
- You wanna go first?
- Yeah.

351
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:17,088
Rob?

352
00:30:18,758 --> 00:30:21,463
Fuck! Rob, there's no more rope.

353
00:30:21,552 --> 00:30:23,924
Can you make it?

354
00:30:30,353 --> 00:30:33,472
- Easy.
- Shit. Shit!

355
00:30:34,732 --> 00:30:36,475
Easy.

356
00:31:15,104 --> 00:31:19,102
Alison! How is it?

357
00:31:19,192 --> 00:31:20,769
Fucking scary, Rob.

358
00:31:22,236 --> 00:31:25,688
There's no footholds for five feet.
You be careful, OK?

359
00:32:01,317 --> 00:32:02,728
Rob!

360
00:32:07,656 --> 00:32:11,357
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

361
00:32:11,452 --> 00:32:14,950
<i>Oh, my God! Oh, my God!</i>

362
00:32:29,385 --> 00:32:33,050
Look, why don't we carry her?
Me and Ed could take it in turns.

363
00:32:33,139 --> 00:32:34,799
- Makes sense.
- OK.

364
00:32:36,225 --> 00:32:37,803
<i>- Come on.
- Here you go.</i>

365
00:32:37,894 --> 00:32:39,767
<i>Be gentle.</i>

366
00:32:39,854 --> 00:32:41,182
Anna!

367
00:32:43,775 --> 00:32:45,019
- Come on.
- Jesus Christ!

368
00:32:45,109 --> 00:32:46,484
- Put her down.
- Whoa.

369
00:32:48,779 --> 00:32:51,864
<i>Right, so what do we do now?
You won't be able to carry her.</i>

370
00:32:52,366 --> 00:32:56,744
<i>- I can try.
- You'll collapse after 100 yards.</i>

371
00:32:57,788 --> 00:32:59,448
Then we'll go at Anna's pace.

372
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:02,327
- That's pretty fucking slow.
- Watch your language.

373
00:33:02,418 --> 00:33:04,660
- She can't understand.
- Hardly the point.

374
00:33:04,754 --> 00:33:07,957
- For fuck's sake.
- We've gotta keep moving. Come on.

375
00:33:08,049 --> 00:33:10,670
Do you have any idea
what she's been through?

376
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:14,592
I get it, OK?
Can we just go now? Please?

377
00:33:16,057 --> 00:33:17,337
- Come on.
- OK.

378
00:33:17,433 --> 00:33:19,674
Come on, sweetie. We have to go.

379
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:19,898
Fuck!

380
00:34:21,828 --> 00:34:22,991
Jesus!

381
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,996
Fuck. Fuck it. Fuck!

382
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:40,714
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

383
00:36:40,963 --> 00:36:42,374
Hey!

384
00:36:44,883 --> 00:36:45,963
Hey!

385
00:36:49,013 --> 00:36:50,637
Help!

386
00:36:59,523 --> 00:37:00,898
Fuck you!

387
00:37:02,651 --> 00:37:04,394
Fuck you.

388
00:38:23,229 --> 00:38:24,771
It's been cut!

389
00:38:39,745 --> 00:38:42,367
<i>I think it's about a mile away
to the river.</i>

390
00:38:51,924 --> 00:38:53,417
There they are.

391
00:38:58,221 --> 00:39:01,424
- I see them.
- How far?

392
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:05,719
400 yards, maybe more.

393
00:39:05,812 --> 00:39:09,762
- You got a shot?
- At this range?

394
00:39:11,276 --> 00:39:14,230
Don't waste it.
Let's get over that next ridge.

395
00:39:42,849 --> 00:39:44,259
There they are.

396
00:39:51,399 --> 00:39:54,684
Chuck us over your hip flask
and give me a nip.

397
00:40:03,034 --> 00:40:05,323
What is this filthy shit?

398
00:40:05,412 --> 00:40:08,615
- It's spirit drink.
- Spirit drink?

399
00:40:08,706 --> 00:40:12,835
I got it at the petrol garage. It's so
cheap they can't even call it vodka.

400
00:40:12,919 --> 00:40:15,671
- It's pish.
- It gets the job done.

401
00:40:24,806 --> 00:40:26,086
Hello there.

402
00:40:26,975 --> 00:40:28,385
Good afternoon.

403
00:40:30,895 --> 00:40:32,722
What are you fellas doing out here?

404
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:35,267
Hiking.

405
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:40,149
Long way from civilisation.

406
00:40:40,238 --> 00:40:42,111
That's the idea.

407
00:40:42,198 --> 00:40:43,609
You stalking?

408
00:40:44,659 --> 00:40:45,857
Yeah.

409
00:40:46,702 --> 00:40:49,538
You know the hunting season's been over
for three months?

410
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:50,944
What do you care?

411
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:56,247
It's just if you're hunting out of
season, we're gonna have to report you.

412
00:40:57,296 --> 00:40:59,170
That's a pretty big gun.

413
00:40:59,257 --> 00:41:02,791
It's a 308. It'll put a dent
in just about anything.

414
00:41:04,428 --> 00:41:06,550
You think the deer
have a fighting chance?

415
00:41:07,305 --> 00:41:09,927
I think everything's
got a fighting chance.

416
00:41:11,977 --> 00:41:13,471
Do you?

417
00:41:13,561 --> 00:41:16,183
You boys a pair of animal rights
wankers, are you?

418
00:41:16,272 --> 00:41:17,850
You're a long way from anywhere.

419
00:41:17,941 --> 00:41:21,392
Me and him don't take kindly to
left-wing bastards coming out here...

420
00:41:25,532 --> 00:41:29,779
Please. Oh, please, don't do it.
I'll stop hunting.

421
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:32,777
But everything's got a fighting chance,
right?

422
00:41:35,458 --> 00:41:37,166
He said that.

423
00:41:38,336 --> 00:41:40,375
Please. Please don't kill me.

424
00:41:40,463 --> 00:41:42,123
Take a step back.

425
00:41:42,215 --> 00:41:44,788
- Oh, God, please. Please, no.
- Hey.

426
00:41:45,969 --> 00:41:47,083
Do it.

427
00:41:48,388 --> 00:41:50,511
<i>- Jesus Christ.
- Keep going.</i>

428
00:41:50,598 --> 00:41:52,223
Oh, God, no.

429
00:41:52,308 --> 00:41:54,217
That's it.

430
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:56,386
- And another.
- Please. Oh, fuck.

431
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:59,515
- Don't stop.
- Oh, dear God!

432
00:42:10,368 --> 00:42:11,743
And that's that.

433
00:42:26,256 --> 00:42:27,371
You still with me?

434
00:42:30,552 --> 00:42:32,047
Whatever it takes.

435
00:42:32,638 --> 00:42:35,045
I think it might take a bit more
than we thought.

436
00:42:38,519 --> 00:42:41,223
Aye. It might.

437
00:42:53,992 --> 00:42:56,032
<i>How did they sound?</i>

438
00:42:56,119 --> 00:42:59,903
Practised. In control. Like they knew
exactly what they were doing.

439
00:42:59,998 --> 00:43:02,157
That's usually a good sign.

440
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:03,579
<i>Follow the road.</i>

441
00:43:03,669 --> 00:43:07,962
- Remind me of the name of this place.
- Annan Mor. Southwest of Inverness.

442
00:43:08,048 --> 00:43:09,922
Still a good 80 miles.

443
00:43:32,655 --> 00:43:33,900
<i>Hey!</i>

444
00:43:36,283 --> 00:43:37,694
Hey!

445
00:43:37,826 --> 00:43:41,575
Look. Look. Look. Alison.

446
00:43:43,582 --> 00:43:45,907
The rope was cut.

447
00:43:46,001 --> 00:43:50,580
The rope was cut.
Someone cut the rope.

448
00:43:50,672 --> 00:43:53,045
- Can you hear her?
- She's smashed her legs up.

449
00:43:53,133 --> 00:43:56,218
You can see it in her leg and her arms.
Something's wrong, Jen.

450
00:43:57,471 --> 00:43:59,629
It's alright, sweetheart,
don't be scared.

451
00:43:59,723 --> 00:44:01,004
Don't be scared. It's OK.

452
00:44:01,099 --> 00:44:05,808
Someone cut the rope. Rob was murdered.

453
00:44:05,896 --> 00:44:08,268
- Can you hear what she's saying?
- Look at her leg.

454
00:44:08,357 --> 00:44:11,523
We can't understand
a word you're saying.

455
00:44:14,863 --> 00:44:18,149
I need to get across to you
further down the river.

456
00:44:18,241 --> 00:44:23,532
Alison! Alison,
you're gonna have to shout louder.

457
00:44:23,622 --> 00:44:26,871
We need to find a crossing
further downstream.

458
00:44:29,877 --> 00:44:33,744
She wants us to go down the river.
OK, OK. Where's Rob?

459
00:44:33,881 --> 00:44:35,459
Rob, where is he?

460
00:44:35,549 --> 00:44:37,174
Where is he?

461
00:44:47,603 --> 00:44:48,883
<i>Fuck!</i>

462
00:44:54,943 --> 00:44:57,102
<i>What are we gonna do, Jen?</i>

463
00:45:00,366 --> 00:45:02,157
What do we do?

464
00:45:06,997 --> 00:45:08,372
<i>No.</i>

465
00:45:20,469 --> 00:45:23,138
- Jen! Jenny!
- Alex!

466
00:45:23,222 --> 00:45:26,637
<i>Jenny! Jenny!</i>

467
00:45:26,725 --> 00:45:28,053
Alex, Alex, Alex, no!

468
00:45:28,143 --> 00:45:30,432
<i>Jenny! Jenny! Jenny!</i>

469
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:33,437
- Listen to me. Alex!
- Jenny, give me your hand.

470
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:38,563
Alex, she's gone!

471
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:42,811
We can't get her from here.
We've gotta go down there.

472
00:45:54,335 --> 00:45:56,660
Ed, Ed, I can see her.

473
00:45:57,963 --> 00:46:01,712
Hold on to the rocks, Jen.
Hold on to the rocks.

474
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:09,971
- Hold on to the rocks!
- Alex, listen to me.

475
00:46:10,059 --> 00:46:12,763
You have to follow me.
I know what I'm doing. Follow me.

476
00:46:49,429 --> 00:46:50,508
Alison!

477
00:46:52,307 --> 00:46:53,635
Alison!

478
00:46:55,602 --> 00:46:57,429
Come on, come on!

479
00:47:34,599 --> 00:47:36,176
Anna!

480
00:47:39,103 --> 00:47:40,348
Anna!

481
00:47:46,485 --> 00:47:48,144
Anna!

482
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:31,815
No. Gone.

483
00:48:36,784 --> 00:48:37,899
There!

484
00:48:54,968 --> 00:48:56,628
Anna!

485
00:48:57,512 --> 00:49:00,679
Anna! Anna!

486
00:49:00,765 --> 00:49:02,723
Anna!

487
00:50:05,287 --> 00:50:07,612
Come on, Anna.

488
00:50:07,706 --> 00:50:09,912
Come on, Anna. Come on.

489
00:50:19,926 --> 00:50:21,753
OK. Anna.

490
00:50:31,855 --> 00:50:33,764
It's OK, Anna.

491
00:51:23,571 --> 00:51:26,821
Anna! Anna!

492
00:51:57,521 --> 00:51:59,763
<i>Alex. Alex.</i>

493
00:52:03,318 --> 00:52:04,978
Are you alright?

494
00:52:05,988 --> 00:52:07,150
Look at me.

495
00:52:10,033 --> 00:52:14,030
- We have to find the others, OK?
- Right.

496
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:15,780
Ed!

497
00:52:17,081 --> 00:52:18,112
Anna?

498
00:52:21,669 --> 00:52:23,626
<i>Ed!</i>

499
00:53:10,676 --> 00:53:13,083
<i>Here!</i>

500
00:53:55,845 --> 00:53:57,636
<i>Ed.</i>

501
00:53:57,721 --> 00:53:59,180
Anna.

502
00:53:59,265 --> 00:54:00,675
Ed.

503
00:54:03,185 --> 00:54:06,720
Anna. Thank God. Shh. Shh.

504
00:54:11,151 --> 00:54:12,266
What happened?

505
00:54:12,361 --> 00:54:15,896
I fell. It might be broken,
I don't know.

506
00:54:22,996 --> 00:54:24,823
They're coming.

507
00:54:24,915 --> 00:54:26,326
- How many?
- Two.

508
00:54:26,417 --> 00:54:28,040
Shit.

509
00:54:31,379 --> 00:54:33,952
- OK, let's go.
- No. He can't run.

510
00:54:34,048 --> 00:54:37,002
- I can try.
- That won't be enough.

511
00:54:39,512 --> 00:54:44,470
Look, listen. You, me, Ed,
we don't mean a thing to these people.

512
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:48,224
She's the only one with any value.
She's what they want.

513
00:54:57,113 --> 00:54:58,144
That's her!

514
00:55:01,826 --> 00:55:04,364
- What about the others?
- Follow the money!

515
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:07,154
Are you gonna finish him
or do you want me to do it?

516
00:57:07,239 --> 00:57:11,283
After what he's just put us through?
No, I wanna watch him breathe out.

517
00:57:21,336 --> 00:57:23,079
You feel that?

518
00:57:25,090 --> 00:57:27,462
That's the price of your nobility.

519
00:57:30,345 --> 00:57:32,254
Hurts, doesn't it?

520
00:57:44,484 --> 00:57:47,437
<i>In 200 metres, bear left.</i>

521
00:57:49,905 --> 00:57:52,775
<i>In 150 metres, bear left.</i>

522
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:54,611
<i>In one...</i>

523
00:57:58,205 --> 00:57:59,450
Well done.

524
00:58:01,083 --> 00:58:05,330
- How will we know where to go?
- Maybe we should just bear left.

525
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:09,038
People have been finding their way
for years without fucking computers.

526
00:58:09,132 --> 00:58:12,252
There is no equal to a map
and a bit of nous.

527
00:58:12,344 --> 00:58:14,835
- How are we doing back there?
- I'm almost done.

528
00:58:14,930 --> 00:58:17,088
Just gotta check the frequency.

529
00:58:17,557 --> 00:58:21,306
If this briefcase moves so much
as an inch, we're gonna know about it.

530
00:58:21,394 --> 00:58:23,186
<i>Well, that's reassuring.</i>

531
00:58:23,271 --> 00:58:26,806
I may as well wipe my arse on that money
if we can't find the girl.

532
00:58:58,305 --> 00:58:59,633
OK.

533
00:59:01,141 --> 00:59:03,134
OK, Anna, I'm gonna need you
to lean back.

534
00:59:04,478 --> 00:59:05,853
Just take a step.

535
00:59:05,938 --> 00:59:08,144
It's OK, sweetheart.
Just, just lean back.

536
00:59:11,443 --> 00:59:14,978
You gotta trust me. It's OK, I promise.
Just take a step back and lean...

537
00:59:15,072 --> 00:59:16,898
No, Alison. Alison.

538
00:59:16,990 --> 00:59:20,359
Jesus Christ, Anna!
There's no other way down!

539
00:59:22,412 --> 00:59:23,788
OK.

540
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,120
Look at me. Look at me. I've got you.

541
00:59:31,505 --> 00:59:33,497
You have to trust me, sweetheart.

542
00:59:34,174 --> 00:59:35,419
OK?

543
00:59:35,509 --> 00:59:39,007
Put your shoulders back. Lean back.

544
00:59:39,094 --> 00:59:41,052
There you go.

545
00:59:41,138 --> 00:59:44,258
Good girl. Good girl.

546
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:53,940
<i>It's OK, Anna. Keep coming.</i>

547
00:59:54,026 --> 00:59:56,268
Oops. Keep coming. Steady, steady.

548
01:00:03,117 --> 01:00:06,985
OK. Alright. I've got you. I've got you.

549
01:00:33,647 --> 01:00:37,562
- This is no time for a rest. Let's go.
- Just give me a moment, please.

550
01:00:37,651 --> 01:00:40,107
If Alex made it,
he'd have called the police.

551
01:00:42,364 --> 01:00:44,238
They could already be looking for us.

552
01:00:45,117 --> 01:00:46,695
You heard the shots, Alison.

553
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:49,698
He's dead.

554
01:00:54,001 --> 01:00:55,626
Let's go. Get up.

555
01:00:56,170 --> 01:00:57,629
Get up!

556
01:00:59,131 --> 01:01:00,625
Leave me here.

557
01:01:02,593 --> 01:01:04,965
I'm slowing you down as it is.
Just leave me here.

558
01:01:05,054 --> 01:01:07,129
- You don't want that.
- I've broken my leg.

559
01:01:07,221 --> 01:01:10,388
- What more do you want?
- It's not broken. You're walking on it.

560
01:01:13,853 --> 01:01:17,637
- What if we've done the wrong thing?
- What do you mean?

561
01:01:22,487 --> 01:01:25,060
Maybe we should have left her there.

562
01:01:25,156 --> 01:01:28,572
- What?
- Hear me out. Please.

563
01:01:28,659 --> 01:01:30,451
Please listen to me.

564
01:01:31,454 --> 01:01:32,829
Why was she even there?

565
01:01:32,914 --> 01:01:35,784
Why in Scotland?
She clearly sounds Eastern European.

566
01:01:35,875 --> 01:01:38,033
I don't know, Ed.
I don't know. You tell me.

567
01:01:38,127 --> 01:01:41,211
Maybe she was kidnapped.
She's still in her school uniform.

568
01:01:41,297 --> 01:01:44,084
She was probably snatched
right outside the school.

569
01:01:44,175 --> 01:01:47,092
Kidnappers usually demand a ransom,
don't they?

570
01:01:48,346 --> 01:01:53,173
In which case there's probably
another party involved, police.

571
01:01:53,976 --> 01:01:57,475
And what if we've come along
and trampled on a delicate situation?

572
01:01:58,189 --> 01:02:01,273
We might have blown her chances
of a safe handover.

573
01:02:02,109 --> 01:02:03,651
What if we've killed her?

574
01:02:04,278 --> 01:02:06,401
What if this is all our fault?

575
01:02:06,489 --> 01:02:08,481
- Look at her.
- I'm just...

576
01:02:08,574 --> 01:02:10,152
Just fucking look at her.

577
01:02:11,410 --> 01:02:15,323
Could you leave her in the ground?
Could you?

578
01:02:17,206 --> 01:02:18,238
No.

579
01:02:19,917 --> 01:02:21,328
Then there's your answer.

580
01:02:23,338 --> 01:02:26,623
Did her family do this to her?
Was she kidnapped? I don't know.

581
01:02:26,716 --> 01:02:29,586
And you don't know.
But if we've done the wrong thing,

582
01:02:29,677 --> 01:02:33,426
then I'll fucking live with it.
Now get up! Find a way.

583
01:02:36,893 --> 01:02:38,850
They'll be heading up to Annan Mor.

584
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:42,854
<i>And here we are,
empty fucking handed.</i>

585
01:02:44,192 --> 01:02:47,442
Look, you remember that Japanese kid
last winter? Remember him?

586
01:02:47,528 --> 01:02:49,817
Rats crawled through the pipe,
ate him alive.

587
01:02:49,906 --> 01:02:52,443
- What about him?
- Parents still paid up.

588
01:02:52,533 --> 01:02:56,661
Bluffed our way out of that. Maybe
we can't bluff our way out of this.

589
01:02:57,913 --> 01:03:01,448
You do it your way. I'll try mine.

590
01:03:12,928 --> 01:03:15,336
<i>You're probably wondering</i>

591
01:03:15,431 --> 01:03:17,340
<i>why your daughter
has not come home.</i>

592
01:03:17,433 --> 01:03:20,883
<i>We have dug a hole,
four feet by three. She's down there.</i>

593
01:03:21,019 --> 01:03:25,313
<i>She has enough water for a week,
maybe less. She has no food.</i>

594
01:03:25,398 --> 01:03:27,355
<i>There's no chance you can find her.</i>

595
01:03:27,442 --> 01:03:31,439
<i>Her location is as remote
as it is inaccessible.</i>

596
01:03:31,529 --> 01:03:32,774
<i>You're being watched.</i>

597
01:03:32,864 --> 01:03:36,067
<i>If you try and contact the police,
we will leave her where she is.</i>

598
01:03:36,159 --> 01:03:39,824
<i>She will die there. In the dark. Alone.</i>

599
01:03:39,912 --> 01:03:42,071
<i>You will never find her body.</i>

600
01:03:42,165 --> 01:03:45,166
<i>We want money. Six million euros.</i>

601
01:03:45,251 --> 01:03:50,079
<i>Clean, non-sequential. No marked money,
transponders or dye packs.</i>

602
01:03:50,173 --> 01:03:53,127
<i>More instructions
regarding the hand-off will follow.</i>

603
01:03:53,217 --> 01:03:54,877
<i>Stay by the phone.</i>

604
01:03:56,595 --> 01:03:57,674
Who taped the call?

605
01:03:58,430 --> 01:04:03,507
My employer records everything.
That includes his ex-wife's telephone.

606
01:04:04,311 --> 01:04:06,932
Well, these bastards aren't stupid,
are they?

607
01:04:07,063 --> 01:04:10,978
If you call the police and they get
nicked, they just gotta deny everything.

608
01:04:11,109 --> 01:04:14,276
Since the girl's in the ground,
there's no connection to us.

609
01:04:14,362 --> 01:04:15,773
She dies about the same time

610
01:04:15,864 --> 01:04:18,485
that the police release them
due to lack of evidence.

611
01:04:18,575 --> 01:04:20,733
There's no body,
no murder investigation.

612
01:04:20,827 --> 01:04:23,283
That is about as sweet a hustle
as I've ever seen.

613
01:04:23,371 --> 01:04:26,740
The only time they expose themselves
is at the hand-off.

614
01:04:28,250 --> 01:04:30,575
Do you know where the pub is?

615
01:04:30,669 --> 01:04:33,504
It's not a big village. I'll find it.

616
01:04:33,589 --> 01:04:36,080
When you get there,
you grab a table by the window.

617
01:04:36,175 --> 01:04:38,926
If you can't find one,
you stand by the bar and you wait.

618
01:04:39,011 --> 01:04:41,336
No one will approach you
until you sit down.

619
01:04:41,430 --> 01:04:43,469
Don't try and guess who it's gonna be.

620
01:04:43,557 --> 01:04:46,226
Think about nothing except that table.
Understand?

621
01:04:46,310 --> 01:04:47,424
Yeah.

622
01:04:49,313 --> 01:04:52,728
Don't look too confident.
Don't look too nervous either.

623
01:04:52,816 --> 01:04:56,683
You find a middle ground. You let 'em
know that it's strictly business.

624
01:04:56,778 --> 01:05:00,230
If they've got the girl,
they're gonna get paid.

625
01:05:00,323 --> 01:05:03,194
- Let's hope they bring her.
- They will. They have to.

626
01:05:03,285 --> 01:05:07,234
They'll keep her out of sight until they
see the money. That's where you come in.

627
01:05:07,330 --> 01:05:10,616
You demand to see her
before you hand it over.

628
01:05:10,709 --> 01:05:13,460
If they can get away
without making a trade, they will.

629
01:05:13,545 --> 01:05:17,412
Leaving a body behind is a lot easier
than making a full exchange.

630
01:05:17,507 --> 01:05:22,465
No one makes a move until we see
the girl. If I return without her...

631
01:05:26,558 --> 01:05:28,349
Have you met her father?

632
01:05:28,435 --> 01:05:31,186
I've heard of him by reputation.

633
01:05:37,067 --> 01:05:40,068
- So you know that...
- He's got a pretty bad reputation.

634
01:05:40,988 --> 01:05:46,029
Have a jolly up in Kosovo, did he?
Little bit of an ethnic spring clean?

635
01:05:46,952 --> 01:05:50,451
Same as the rest of the Serbian wankers
that we slotted back in '99.

636
01:05:50,539 --> 01:05:54,952
So trust me, yes,
I know who I'm dealing with.

637
01:05:55,043 --> 01:05:56,917
Really?

638
01:05:57,004 --> 01:06:00,538
<i>When we make our move,
it's gonna be quick and loud.</i>

639
01:06:00,632 --> 01:06:04,547
Throw yourself on the floor cos he's
gonna go like fucking Christian Bale.

640
01:06:04,636 --> 01:06:07,127
Stay down till me or him picks you up.

641
01:06:07,222 --> 01:06:10,923
All I care about is the girl.
We get her safe and quick.

642
01:06:11,018 --> 01:06:12,642
Then we worry about her captors.

643
01:06:12,728 --> 01:06:15,598
Your employers,
they wanna keep 'em alive?

644
01:06:15,689 --> 01:06:18,262
- If possible.
- We'll see.

645
01:06:20,735 --> 01:06:24,104
No shotguns.
I can't risk you hitting the girl.

646
01:06:24,239 --> 01:06:26,528
It's loaded with solid shot, no spread.

647
01:06:28,326 --> 01:06:31,778
We're English, Darko.
We leave friendly fire to the Yanks.

648
01:06:37,335 --> 01:06:38,960
<i>Hey!</i>

649
01:06:40,546 --> 01:06:42,669
Hey. Hey.

650
01:07:54,785 --> 01:07:57,074
Hi. We, erm... We need to...

651
01:07:57,162 --> 01:07:59,736
We need to report a kidnapping
and three murders.

652
01:08:39,620 --> 01:08:41,945
We'll get you up to Inverness
as quick as we can.

653
01:08:42,039 --> 01:08:45,040
Constable Stewart will drive you.
He shouldn't be a minute.

654
01:08:45,126 --> 01:08:48,126
They can take your statements,
give you medical attention.

655
01:08:48,212 --> 01:08:52,210
I'll be just past the kitchen.
So don't worry, I'm not going anywhere.

656
01:08:52,299 --> 01:08:54,754
- You said kitchen.
- Aye.

657
01:08:54,843 --> 01:08:56,965
She could do with something to eat.

658
01:09:14,612 --> 01:09:17,399
- I can't get through to Inverness.
- Why not?

659
01:09:17,490 --> 01:09:19,946
It's a big country.
It all needs policing.

660
01:09:20,034 --> 01:09:22,241
So call another station.

661
01:09:22,370 --> 01:09:26,699
I've left a message. I'm sure the desk
sergeant will call back in a minute.

662
01:09:27,708 --> 01:09:31,955
Chocolate cake. My wife's recipe.
I think you might just love it.

663
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:52,685
You Darko?

664
01:09:54,276 --> 01:09:55,854
Yes.

665
01:09:57,029 --> 01:09:58,903
You got something for me?

666
01:09:59,865 --> 01:10:02,699
- That depends.
- Does it?

667
01:10:04,035 --> 01:10:07,119
I've got the more valuable
merchandise. What have you got?

668
01:10:08,456 --> 01:10:09,654
Money?

669
01:10:12,752 --> 01:10:16,251
There'll always be money in the world,
mate. Plenty of that to go round.

670
01:10:16,339 --> 01:10:20,289
But this little girl? Unique.

671
01:10:21,636 --> 01:10:23,296
One of a kind.

672
01:10:24,681 --> 01:10:28,513
- What are you trying to say?
- That we do things my way.

673
01:10:32,730 --> 01:10:34,889
You brought the money?

674
01:10:37,151 --> 01:10:38,314
Yeah.

675
01:10:40,530 --> 01:10:43,234
Then this is how we're gonna do it.

676
01:10:43,324 --> 01:10:46,360
I leave here now with the case
and check it with my associates.

677
01:10:46,494 --> 01:10:48,652
All being well and good,

678
01:10:48,746 --> 01:10:53,538
you'll receive a call telling you
where you can find the girl.

679
01:10:57,922 --> 01:10:59,250
No.

680
01:11:03,469 --> 01:11:06,803
- Then I'm gonna leave.
- Go?

681
01:11:06,889 --> 01:11:09,557
You sure?

682
01:11:09,641 --> 01:11:13,057
You're not gonna walk out of here
empty handed

683
01:11:13,144 --> 01:11:15,470
without listening to what I have to say.

684
01:11:15,563 --> 01:11:20,688
- I wouldn't fucking bet on that, mate.
- I stake six million euros on it.

685
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:26,320
That's what you've got in the case?

686
01:11:26,407 --> 01:11:31,153
We both know only fools fill cases
with counterfeit money,

687
01:11:31,246 --> 01:11:36,832
fools who don't care to see
their children again. I'm no fool.

688
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:42,624
I'm glad to hear it. Because the same
thing happened to me a few years back.

689
01:11:44,676 --> 01:11:47,546
I took a boy from his family
in Marseilles.

690
01:11:49,597 --> 01:11:52,349
Well, it was a long negotiation
to say the least.

691
01:11:52,433 --> 01:11:55,138
Went on for so long I made a mistake.

692
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:00,899
I bonded with the boy.

693
01:12:02,443 --> 01:12:04,187
We became close.

694
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:11,989
He kept saying he wanted to come
and visit me when it was all over.

695
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:22,915
His parents decided to hand off
a bag full of shredded newspaper.

696
01:12:23,004 --> 01:12:26,171
Police thought they were gonna catch us
during the drop-off.

697
01:12:28,051 --> 01:12:29,628
Oh, no.

698
01:12:34,056 --> 01:12:37,140
I took the boy out in the garden
to play a game of football.

699
01:12:37,226 --> 01:12:39,598
I remember because he went in goal.

700
01:12:40,896 --> 01:12:44,596
When he bent down to pick up the ball,
I shot him in the back of the head.

701
01:12:45,943 --> 01:12:48,434
Quick. Painless.

702
01:12:50,322 --> 01:12:52,149
Least I could do.

703
01:12:53,700 --> 01:12:56,903
I buried him somewhere
in the southwest of France.

704
01:12:59,915 --> 01:13:02,785
Parents are still looking for him,
last I heard.

705
01:13:05,212 --> 01:13:06,540
Well done.

706
01:13:08,715 --> 01:13:12,380
Like I said, I'm no fool.

707
01:13:14,012 --> 01:13:15,506
Good.

708
01:13:16,681 --> 01:13:18,923
Because that's a true story.

709
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:32,230
You see? Nothing to worry about.

710
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:36,400
- Anyone fancy a cup of tea?
- Tea?

711
01:13:36,492 --> 01:13:38,983
Aye. Nothing like a brew
to set you straight.

712
01:13:39,078 --> 01:13:43,407
No. No, I don't reckon
a brew's gonna do it this time.

713
01:13:43,499 --> 01:13:46,250
You said you were gonna
get us to Inverness.

714
01:13:46,335 --> 01:13:48,742
We wanna get out of here
as quickly as possible.

715
01:13:50,464 --> 01:13:52,456
Understood.

716
01:13:52,591 --> 01:13:55,841
Let me just get on to PC Stewart
and we'll see where he's got to.

717
01:14:03,227 --> 01:14:06,512
- You don't have to be so rude.
- Fuck rude! People are dead.

718
01:14:06,647 --> 01:14:09,683
I wanna get out of this village,
out of this fucking country.

719
01:14:09,775 --> 01:14:11,981
And we will. Relax. We're safe now.

720
01:14:12,069 --> 01:14:15,402
How long's he gonna take?
And where's this other officer?

721
01:14:15,489 --> 01:14:17,398
Sure I can't tempt anyone with a cuppa?

722
01:14:17,491 --> 01:14:20,112
We were supposed to be in a police car
15 minutes ago.

723
01:14:20,202 --> 01:14:22,360
No, thanks! You're being paranoid.

724
01:14:22,454 --> 01:14:25,739
Well, did you actually see him
call for help? Did you hear it?

725
01:14:25,832 --> 01:14:29,117
- Why haven't they returned his call?
- It's only been ten minutes.

726
01:14:29,210 --> 01:14:31,451
A lot can happen in ten minutes, Alison.

727
01:14:32,338 --> 01:14:36,205
Are you ready to trust someone we've
just met after what we've been through?

728
01:14:37,051 --> 01:14:40,883
What if he's keeping us busy while he
waits for his mates to finish us off?

729
01:14:46,393 --> 01:14:47,971
Shit!

730
01:14:51,023 --> 01:14:52,517
- What do we do?
- We should go.

731
01:14:53,734 --> 01:14:57,897
- Let's wait five minutes, see if...
- How much longer do you wanna wait for?

732
01:14:57,988 --> 01:15:00,360
Even if he's not in on it,
what good's he gonna do?

733
01:15:00,449 --> 01:15:04,281
What can he protect us from? He's a fat
man with a badge armed with a biro.

734
01:15:04,369 --> 01:15:07,454
No, I say we leave now.
We take our chances in the crowd.

735
01:15:11,376 --> 01:15:12,621
OK.

736
01:15:12,711 --> 01:15:15,498
Anna, we're just gonna go for a walk,
sweetheart.

737
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:21,052
What's going on? Where are you going?

738
01:15:21,136 --> 01:15:22,299
We're just...

739
01:15:22,387 --> 01:15:24,179
- We're leaving.
- It's not safe.

740
01:15:24,264 --> 01:15:26,838
- Well, we're going.
- Absolutely not.

741
01:15:26,933 --> 01:15:30,018
You're my responsibility.
I'm not letting you out of my sight.

742
01:15:30,103 --> 01:15:32,475
You can't keep us here.
If we wanna go, we'll go.

743
01:15:32,564 --> 01:15:36,430
You want to walk out of here? Fine.
But I can't let you take the girl.

744
01:15:37,860 --> 01:15:40,861
I mean it. You leave,
you leave without her.

745
01:15:41,447 --> 01:15:42,906
<i>Ed!</i>

746
01:15:43,657 --> 01:15:47,073
<i>- Don't come any closer.
- Easy, lad, easy.</i>

747
01:15:47,161 --> 01:15:50,115
Don't do something
you'll have to pay for later.

748
01:15:50,206 --> 01:15:55,117
Put the knife down. Right now.

749
01:15:56,295 --> 01:15:58,334
What the...

750
01:16:03,969 --> 01:16:05,084
Get down!

751
01:16:14,730 --> 01:16:17,137
Stay low, stay low. Keep down.

752
01:16:31,079 --> 01:16:32,989
PC Stewart. Come in, over.

753
01:16:33,916 --> 01:16:39,455
<i>Shots fired. I'm under
attack. I need you back at the station.</i>

754
01:16:47,219 --> 01:16:49,010
<i>Get back against the wall!</i>

755
01:16:49,095 --> 01:16:53,757
- Hey, hey. Is there a back door?
- Yes. You'll need keys.

756
01:16:53,850 --> 01:16:55,474
<i>Where?</i>

757
01:17:01,524 --> 01:17:02,983
<i>Follow me.</i>

758
01:17:03,943 --> 01:17:05,735
Down! Get down!

759
01:17:15,038 --> 01:17:16,496
<i>Anna, quick.</i>

760
01:18:01,583 --> 01:18:04,667
Now what we have here
is a situation based on trust.

761
01:18:04,753 --> 01:18:07,504
I trust you when you say
that you've brought the money.

762
01:18:09,132 --> 01:18:13,758
And you have to trust me when I say
the girl is safe and somewhere nearby.

763
01:18:15,346 --> 01:18:17,469
I can't even walk into to a newsagent

764
01:18:17,557 --> 01:18:20,178
and buy a pack of cigarettes on trust,
my friend.

765
01:18:20,768 --> 01:18:23,853
Now, if I can't do that,

766
01:18:23,938 --> 01:18:27,023
how do you expect me
to let a man like you

767
01:18:27,108 --> 01:18:31,817
walk out of here with a fucking
retirement plan in a briefcase? Hmm?

768
01:18:34,949 --> 01:18:36,609
Man like me?

769
01:18:36,701 --> 01:18:39,536
A kidnapper and a child murderer, yes.

770
01:18:41,456 --> 01:18:42,914
That's a bit personal.

771
01:18:44,751 --> 01:18:49,294
You're a grown man, you can take it.
And this is business.

772
01:18:50,590 --> 01:18:52,666
Like the man in the newsagent.

773
01:18:55,427 --> 01:18:58,712
I hand him the money
because I can see what I'm buying.

774
01:18:58,805 --> 01:19:02,221
It even comes with
a government health warning.

775
01:19:02,309 --> 01:19:07,895
He gives me what I want
and we both walk away happy.

776
01:19:07,981 --> 01:19:09,724
So, no.

777
01:19:11,943 --> 01:19:13,983
This is not based on trust.

778
01:19:15,030 --> 01:19:18,030
This is based
on what I can see in front of me.

779
01:19:22,620 --> 01:19:24,779
And you're getting nothing...

780
01:19:26,624 --> 01:19:29,032
...until I see the girl. Nothing.

781
01:19:38,177 --> 01:19:39,802
<i>He's got a gun! Run!</i>

782
01:19:56,154 --> 01:19:57,648
<i>Hurry, hurry.</i>

783
01:19:58,322 --> 01:19:59,733
Fuck!

784
01:20:46,619 --> 01:20:50,403
They don't have the girl.
They don't have the girl!

785
01:20:53,418 --> 01:20:54,793
They've lost the girl.

786
01:20:54,878 --> 01:20:56,502
<i>It's a bluff.</i>

787
01:21:42,423 --> 01:21:43,965
Where are you?

788
01:21:56,728 --> 01:21:58,306
Hey, hey, I love you.

789
01:22:16,330 --> 01:22:17,990
How am I doing, mate?

790
01:22:22,211 --> 01:22:26,291
Never mind the bollocks.
Give it me straight.

791
01:22:29,009 --> 01:22:32,877
It's gone straight through the vest
and made a wreck of you. You're dying.

792
01:22:33,764 --> 01:22:36,635
You don't have long
and there's nothing I can do.

793
01:22:37,643 --> 01:22:38,758
Just bad luck, mate.

794
01:22:44,525 --> 01:22:45,723
Gun.

795
01:22:47,027 --> 01:22:48,652
Gun.

796
01:23:28,109 --> 01:23:30,232
Hey! What's going on?

797
01:23:45,251 --> 01:23:46,413
Get down!

798
01:24:24,123 --> 01:24:27,123
You should have just given us the girl!

799
01:24:32,755 --> 01:24:35,626
Where has your compassion
gotten you today?

800
01:24:45,268 --> 01:24:46,975
You fucking bitch!

801
01:25:58,546 --> 01:26:00,005
Hello again.

802
01:28:33,198 --> 01:28:35,321
Darko, you're a man of your word.

803
01:29:32,797 --> 01:29:34,505
It's OK.

804
01:29:39,763 --> 01:29:43,047
It's OK, Anna. It's OK.

805
01:29:46,101 --> 01:29:47,928
It's OK.

806
01:30:24,513 --> 01:30:28,725
- What the hell is this?
- This is her father. Now you get paid.

807
01:30:28,809 --> 01:30:30,802
If this starts to feel like an ambush,

808
01:30:30,895 --> 01:30:33,433
I will take the top
of your fucking head off.

809
01:30:34,315 --> 01:30:37,684
- Just so we're clear.
- Stay in the car until I call for you.

810
01:30:37,777 --> 01:30:40,777
- Let me do the talking.
- Don't talk yourself out of a life.

811
01:30:40,863 --> 01:30:42,487
My employer is a businessman.

812
01:30:43,532 --> 01:30:45,739
Last I heard,
he was a fucking war criminal.

813
01:30:45,826 --> 01:30:47,368
Nice.

814
01:31:48,846 --> 01:31:50,886
500,000.

815
01:31:51,807 --> 01:31:53,847
I can get it for you in an hour.

816
01:31:57,313 --> 01:31:58,641
No?

817
01:32:00,524 --> 01:32:02,683
It was worth a try.

818
01:32:03,694 --> 01:32:07,193
My daughter must have looked like
a good payday to you.

819
01:32:07,281 --> 01:32:09,404
Divorce has made my ex-wife rich.

820
01:32:09,491 --> 01:32:11,614
There is very little
she could not afford.

821
01:32:12,328 --> 01:32:16,324
But behind every woman with money
is a man with deep pockets.

822
01:32:16,414 --> 01:32:19,581
You should have concerned yourself
with how he lined them.

823
01:32:21,461 --> 01:32:23,537
Strip that piece of shit.

824
01:32:39,103 --> 01:32:41,594
Darko tells me you lost a man.

825
01:32:42,064 --> 01:32:43,440
That's right.

826
01:32:44,233 --> 01:32:48,895
Don't cry too hard.
Now you won't have to split your fee.

827
01:32:50,406 --> 01:32:52,280
My daughter is safe.

828
01:32:53,117 --> 01:32:55,275
I am in debt to you.

829
01:32:56,037 --> 01:32:58,160
There's a way to fix that.

830
01:33:00,082 --> 01:33:02,205
Your account has already been credited.

831
01:33:03,878 --> 01:33:07,710
You can keep the car. A parting gift.

832
01:33:20,769 --> 01:33:24,184
Put him in the ground. Prepare my tools.

833
01:34:18,533 --> 01:34:20,656
Do you understand what she said?

834
01:34:22,912 --> 01:34:25,284
I think she said "thank you".

835
01:34:41,138 --> 01:34:43,214
<i>Are you alright, sweetheart?</i>

836
01:34:47,769 --> 01:34:48,932
Yeah.

837
01:34:52,858 --> 01:34:59,856
<i># There'll never be peace

838
01:35:00,949 --> 01:35:06,987
<i># The Church is in ruins,
the State is in jars</i>

839
01:35:07,080 --> 01:35:13,118
