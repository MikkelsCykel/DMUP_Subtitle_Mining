00:02:57,647 --> 00:02:59,046
-Be sure to lock the door.
-l'll lock it.

2
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,446
Hi, there. Go on in.

3
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:10,386
-Hi, Ms. Morgan.
-Oh, Alvin. l should have called you.

4
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,218
The kids are having a party.
lt's in full swing.

5
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:17,785
That's okay. l can still clean the pool.
They won't be in my way.

6
00:03:19,129 --> 00:03:21,723
Okay. Okay.

7
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,830
Okay, okay. lt's about time
you made it, man.

8
00:03:29,103 --> 00:03:31,230
Talking all that garbage in school.

9
00:03:31,304 --> 00:03:33,238
That's you, baby. What? What?

10
00:03:33,407 --> 00:03:35,432
Look at you.

11
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:13,603
There you are.

12
00:04:15,805 --> 00:04:19,104
You know, l've been looking
all over for you.

13
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:24,403
Come here!

14
00:04:24,612 --> 00:04:26,341
Mama's little baby.

15
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,512
Thank you so much
for watching over the grill.

16
00:04:29,683 --> 00:04:32,243
-No problem.
-Yeah, thanks.

17
00:04:34,386 --> 00:04:38,379
Forget it, man. Chicks like Paris
don't date outside the NBA.

18
00:05:47,507 --> 00:05:49,338
Swim lessons, boy!

19
00:05:49,409 --> 00:05:51,343
All wet.

20
00:05:51,411 --> 00:05:52,810
You need some Floaties.

21
00:05:53,212 --> 00:05:54,941
Get that garbage out of the pool!

22
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:00,545
Let me give you a tip, punk.

23
00:06:00,718 --> 00:06:02,777
Next time you wanna crash a party...

24
00:06:02,953 --> 00:06:06,787
-...don't fall in the pool.
-He's the pool boy, Ted.

25
00:06:06,955 --> 00:06:10,789
lf he was in the pool,
it was for a reason, l'm sure.

26
00:06:13,662 --> 00:06:16,392
Well, it's more technical than you think.
See, l was just--

27
00:06:16,563 --> 00:06:19,532
Anyhoo! Come on, man.

28
00:06:19,698 --> 00:06:22,861
-Let's get out of here.
-Thinks he's on the swim team or something.

29
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:08,803
Can you believe she had the nerve to ask
me what it was like being with him?

30
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,870
l was like, "Oh, my God."

31
00:07:14,474 --> 00:07:16,738
Hello? Right now?

32
00:07:16,942 --> 00:07:19,376
Dru's on TV!

33
00:07:25,682 --> 00:07:27,377
A year ago, he was going to his prom.

34
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:30,018
He had his corsage
and that old-school frilly shirt.

35
00:07:30,753 --> 00:07:33,688
Now he's living pro-baller style.
One hell of a jump.

36
00:07:33,855 --> 00:07:36,983
-Why did you bring up the corsage?
-Because we all did it.

37
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:39,987
I bet your peoples
on the West Coast miss you.

38
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:42,490
-You probably got a girl there.
-Oh, my God.

39
00:07:42,996 --> 00:07:46,363
I have a job. I play professional basketball.
That's what I do.

40
00:07:46,665 --> 00:07:50,032
Otherwise, you know how it is, Stu.
I'm a free agent.

41
00:07:50,735 --> 00:07:54,432
All right. Officially, he is a member
of the NBA.

42
00:07:54,503 --> 00:07:57,267
Let's go back to SportsCenter.

43
00:07:57,406 --> 00:08:01,672
Free agent? Free agent?

44
00:08:04,845 --> 00:08:06,779
Paged him.

45
00:08:30,665 --> 00:08:34,897
l'll see you in homeroom, all right?

46
00:08:46,477 --> 00:08:48,468
Yo. How you guys doing?

47
00:08:48,544 --> 00:08:51,513
-Did you see the update on the GM website?
-What update?

48
00:08:51,581 --> 00:08:54,914
Some guy in Kentucky boosted his
power-to-weight ratio by 10 percent.

49
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:57,551
You have the best design.
New York guy gave up.

50
00:08:57,718 --> 00:09:00,585
The Kentucky guy is desperate.
Don't worry about it.

51
00:09:00,754 --> 00:09:02,984
Except durability. And power-to-weight.

52
00:09:03,756 --> 00:09:05,724
That's where the new camshaft comes in.

53
00:09:05,891 --> 00:09:07,825
lt's lighter and stronger
at the same time.

54
00:09:07,993 --> 00:09:10,826
You're one of the three finalists, Alvin.
You're the man!

55
00:09:13,397 --> 00:09:14,659
Hey.

56
00:09:14,865 --> 00:09:18,426
We're only discussing you getting
a full-ride, four-year scholarship--

57
00:09:18,634 --> 00:09:21,797
She's like a Frappuccino with hips.

58
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:28,541
-lt's like they all saw the interview.
-They did. lt was on SportsCenter.

59
00:09:28,909 --> 00:09:31,434
Grande Mocha Brownie Frappuccino.

60
00:09:31,611 --> 00:09:34,705
With mint hot fudge
and mint whipped cream.

61
00:09:36,114 --> 00:09:37,979
Dream on.

62
00:09:38,149 --> 00:09:40,982
Clearly, Alvin's not masturbating enough.

63
00:09:41,152 --> 00:09:45,521
Thank God l don't have that problem.
All right, holler at your people, now.

64
00:09:45,721 --> 00:09:47,985
-l'm not touching that.
-l don't want to.

65
00:09:48,724 --> 00:09:50,021
l don't want to.

66
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:54,526
Yvonne's right. Act like he called
with a good explanation.

67
00:09:56,163 --> 00:10:00,725
He better call, and he better have
a good explanation. Look at me.

68
00:10:15,677 --> 00:10:18,544
Look at them. Not a care in the world.

69
00:10:18,747 --> 00:10:22,080
lf they catch you staring, they'll send
the jocks to kick our asses.

70
00:10:22,549 --> 00:10:24,141
No, they won't.

71
00:10:25,118 --> 00:10:28,576
-We're invisible.
-lnvisible?

72
00:10:28,654 --> 00:10:32,385
Not "invisible" invisible.
Just invisible to them.

73
00:10:33,057 --> 00:10:35,651
We'd be visible if we'd walk
down that hallway.

74
00:10:39,428 --> 00:10:42,090
Why can't we walk down that hallway?
lt's a hallway.

75
00:10:42,564 --> 00:10:45,055
ln that community, we're immigrants
without green cards.

76
00:10:45,466 --> 00:10:49,027
What? Boy, l got on high fashion
just like them. Check this out.

77
00:10:50,771 --> 00:10:55,538
A fake label from the lnternet stuck
on some Wranglers. Very high fashion.

78
00:10:55,707 --> 00:10:57,072
-Man, watch this.
-Walter.

79
00:10:57,475 --> 00:11:00,000
-Hey, Walter.
-Walter, no!

80
00:11:00,177 --> 00:11:03,669
Hell, son, you in the wrong hall, man!

81
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,040
l mean, l'll get you, there.
l breaks it down.

82
00:11:07,784 --> 00:11:08,944
Yeah. Hey, girl.

83
00:11:09,117 --> 00:11:12,052
You like how l do that?

84
00:11:12,587 --> 00:11:13,952
Yo, man!

85
00:11:16,457 --> 00:11:20,188
-Y'all busters stinking up our hallway again?
-No, no, dudes. lt's cool, bro.

86
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,024
Look. Check this.

87
00:11:22,194 --> 00:11:23,957
Oh, what's up with that, Ted?

88
00:11:24,129 --> 00:11:27,929
ls that the gay surrender? You a homo thug?
Man, l ought to kick your ass!

89
00:11:31,067 --> 00:11:32,728
Punk.

90
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:37,030
Stay out of here.

91
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:42,703
l got on Sean Johns.
l'm gonna make me some Phat Farms.

92
00:11:42,776 --> 00:11:46,075
-No, l mean, buy some.
-Don't come down this hallway again!

93
00:11:46,479 --> 00:11:48,947
No, man. No, man. We can't be having that.

94
00:11:51,883 --> 00:11:53,612
lt sounded great.

95
00:11:53,818 --> 00:11:56,446
After you win, we should drop
this in the Galaxie.

96
00:11:56,621 --> 00:11:58,782
lf l win.

97
00:11:58,989 --> 00:12:01,753
No offense, but this baby's going with me.

98
00:12:01,924 --> 00:12:04,984
Keep it in my dorm room.
Until l get a car.

99
00:12:05,894 --> 00:12:07,885
No "if." When you win, man.

100
00:12:09,497 --> 00:12:11,089
l sure hope l win.

101
00:12:11,665 --> 00:12:13,633
lt'd be a nice change.

102
00:12:14,634 --> 00:12:16,226
Tired of people calling us losers.

103
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:20,764
-Who says we're losers?
-What's the matter with you?

104
00:12:20,971 --> 00:12:23,769
Being depressed and cynical is my job.

105
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:25,599
Man...

106
00:12:25,809 --> 00:12:28,642
...we're about to graduate soon.

107
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:30,701
We never go on dates.

108
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,144
Never go to any dances.

109
00:12:35,216 --> 00:12:37,081
We have no memories.

110
00:12:37,251 --> 00:12:39,583
l mean, we're settling.

111
00:12:42,656 --> 00:12:44,123
And they're not.

112
00:13:24,687 --> 00:13:26,985
Clarence! Dinner's ready!

113
00:13:27,189 --> 00:13:29,987
Can you turn off that music, please?

114
00:13:30,191 --> 00:13:34,127
Turn off the music like you been
turning off your loving.

115
00:13:36,263 --> 00:13:38,561
Alvin, honey, turn that game off.
Come on, time to eat.

116
00:13:38,698 --> 00:13:42,156
Aretha, come on, honey, time to eat.
Let's go.

117
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:00,043
Gracious God.

118
00:14:05,851 --> 00:14:07,250
So...

119
00:14:07,719 --> 00:14:10,813
-...Alvin, got a date tonight?
-Dad, you're in denial.

120
00:14:11,189 --> 00:14:14,022
Shut up, you Bride of Chucky-looking
extraterrestrial--

121
00:14:14,191 --> 00:14:17,058
That's not even funny, stupid.

122
00:14:17,226 --> 00:14:20,059
Well, Alvin, what do you have
planned for tonight, boy?

123
00:14:20,763 --> 00:14:23,027
l'm gonna do some work on the computer.

124
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:26,860
All the schematics have to be
coded in HTML for the GM website.

125
00:14:27,034 --> 00:14:29,229
Then me and the guys
will bust out some Xbox.

126
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:32,763
See that? Your son's a healthy,
heterosexual dork.

127
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:35,740
-Shut up, Lil' Kim in training!
-Both of you, hush now.

128
00:14:35,907 --> 00:14:37,738
Why you always blaming me?

129
00:14:37,808 --> 00:14:40,834
Go straight to the auto yard
when you get that part.

130
00:14:41,011 --> 00:14:43,138
l don't like you walking
with that much cash.

131
00:14:43,313 --> 00:14:46,282
-Why not? How much is it?
-$ 1500.

132
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:50,744
$ 1500?

133
00:14:50,818 --> 00:14:54,083
My boy got $ 1500
cleaning swimming pools?

134
00:14:54,288 --> 00:14:59,055
Yeah, and he collected it in genuine
currency, not lOUs or food stamps.

135
00:14:59,892 --> 00:15:01,257
Hold on, now.

136
00:15:01,626 --> 00:15:03,924
Food stamps just like money.

137
00:15:04,095 --> 00:15:06,928
-Try to buy school clothes with them.
-Watch yourself.

138
00:15:07,131 --> 00:15:09,929
Look, son.

139
00:15:10,767 --> 00:15:13,827
Your mama right.
You know, we proud of you.

140
00:15:14,002 --> 00:15:17,802
Work on your little engine and
your little school stuff and all that...

141
00:15:17,873 --> 00:15:22,901
...but listen to me, son. All that working
like that without no loving?

142
00:15:23,076 --> 00:15:26,204
That drive a man crazy.

143
00:15:26,678 --> 00:15:29,841
You hear about students in China,
all jumping out windows...

144
00:15:30,015 --> 00:15:33,382
...because they be under so much pressure.
You know why they jump?

145
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:37,252
They ain't got enough singing,
and ain't enough loving over there.

146
00:15:37,421 --> 00:15:39,252
You ever heard a Chinese love song?

147
00:15:39,789 --> 00:15:43,725
How many Chinese people over there?
Give me a figure. About 25--?

148
00:15:43,892 --> 00:15:45,325
What, about 30 billion of them?

149
00:15:45,794 --> 00:15:48,228
30 billion people ain't got a one
Barry White.

150
00:15:48,395 --> 00:15:53,094
Ever seen a big old fat, black, Chinese
Barry White man? Any of them?

151
00:15:53,299 --> 00:15:56,325
Hell, no, ain't gonna see one either.

152
00:15:56,802 --> 00:15:59,236
Dad, l hear you on the whole dating thing.

153
00:15:59,403 --> 00:16:02,998
-But sometimes you wanna hang out--
-Let me tell you something.

154
00:16:07,343 --> 00:16:09,243
-Clarence!
-Oh, shut up.

155
00:16:16,918 --> 00:16:18,112
Don't worry, honey, he'll call.

156
00:16:18,818 --> 00:16:21,844
Speaking of calling, my cell phone
doesn't work at the resort...

157
00:16:22,021 --> 00:16:25,821
-...so if you need me, call the resort.
-l know, number's on the fridge.

158
00:16:28,358 --> 00:16:32,761
You know what? l'll just be a second.
l forgot to put the car in the garage.

159
00:16:32,929 --> 00:16:35,193
-Can't leave my Escalade--
-You're killing me.

160
00:16:35,364 --> 00:16:36,888
Come on, sweetie.

161
00:16:37,065 --> 00:16:38,430
Mom, go!

162
00:16:39,401 --> 00:16:42,097
-l'll put it in for you.
-Okay.

163
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:44,169
Park it and leave it.

164
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:48,797
Don't even think about cruising around
with your friends, thinking you're cute.

165
00:16:49,007 --> 00:16:52,135
-l mean it. You are not on my insurance.
-Mom, stop!

166
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:54,370
Look, you give yourself no credit.

167
00:16:54,846 --> 00:16:57,974
-You ain't no fool-maker.
-She's right, and we're late.

168
00:16:58,281 --> 00:16:59,771
-Love you.
-Love you too.

169
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:03,147
Don't worry, honey, he will call
on one of those phones.

170
00:17:21,867 --> 00:17:25,928
-l'm balling.
-Girl, your mama's wheels are tight.

171
00:17:32,474 --> 00:17:36,843
Take your time. Give everyone
a chance to envy.

172
00:17:37,245 --> 00:17:39,713
-Paris is rolling!
-Yo, that's hot!

173
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,345
-lt's Dru.
-This is perfect.

174
00:17:43,516 --> 00:17:45,950
Stay on the phone with him
while we drive up.

175
00:17:46,117 --> 00:17:48,950
-Too bad we don't have a speaker.
-Do l mention the interview?

176
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:52,350
Hell, yeah, you mention
the damn interview, girl.

177
00:17:52,523 --> 00:17:54,491
-Just be cool.
-And sweet.

178
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:58,058
No, sweet is weak, Zoe.

179
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:01,423
-He can't see you through the phone!
-Just answer it.

180
00:18:01,896 --> 00:18:04,888
-Hello, Dru?
-Who's your boo, baby?

181
00:18:04,965 --> 00:18:07,900
You're my boo, baby, but why
did you have to go and dis me?

182
00:18:08,101 --> 00:18:10,968
Why you sweating me?
Come on. Who loves you?

183
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:13,964
Dru loves you. Never stop, never will stop.

184
00:18:14,138 --> 00:18:17,335
Don't hate the player, baby. Hate the game.

185
00:18:17,508 --> 00:18:22,411
Hey, this looks pretty cool. Hopefully,
Russell Simmons doesn't kick your ass.

186
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:27,908
-Wait until the whole car looks like that.
-Then all the girls will notice us? No.

187
00:18:28,117 --> 00:18:32,747
At least with the Phat Farm, we'll get
some phat booties to rub on. Talk to you!

188
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,286
l hate y'all, man.

189
00:18:37,123 --> 00:18:39,751
Man, l'm telling you,
we'll roll up in this car...

190
00:18:39,926 --> 00:18:42,121
...everybody's head's gonna be turning.

191
00:18:42,394 --> 00:18:45,886
-So, baby, really, it was just publicity?
-Yeah, girl.

192
00:18:46,063 --> 00:18:47,758
Hey, hold on, okay? Hold on.

193
00:18:49,299 --> 00:18:51,164
He's got me on hold.

194
00:18:54,035 --> 00:18:57,527
Feel like popping a cork, sugar?

195
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:01,873
-Who's that?
-Who's who?

196
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:05,939
The limo driver popped a tire. l gotta go.

197
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,136
Oh, no, you don't. Then say my name.

198
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,381
-Better say it.
-Say my name!

199
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,881
You better say my name.
He didn't say it.

200
00:19:14,051 --> 00:19:16,019
What do you mean, he didn't say it?

201
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,783
-He didn't say my name!
-Look out!

202
00:19:24,826 --> 00:19:26,157
Oh, she done messed the ride!

203
00:19:26,927 --> 00:19:32,194
-Yo, l got an uncle that could fix that, baby!
-Better get Maaco!

204
00:19:32,966 --> 00:19:34,126
OnStar emergency.

205
00:19:34,366 --> 00:19:35,993
l'll stand anywhere, baby.

206
00:19:37,368 --> 00:19:41,361
-Is there an emergency in your vehicle?
-Do you know how much that will cost?

207
00:19:42,339 --> 00:19:43,135
-$3000?
-And about two weeks in terms of labor.

208
00:19:46,241 --> 00:19:47,173
l'm a little backed up.

209
00:19:47,343 --> 00:19:50,312
Can we figure out some kind of
payment schedule?

210
00:19:52,313 --> 00:19:55,282
Yeah, sure. Here's what we can do.
You give me 300 now...

211
00:19:55,482 --> 00:19:58,315
...and come back two weeks
from Monday with 2700.

212
00:19:58,517 --> 00:20:02,476
And that's cash on delivery,
not check on delivery.

213
00:20:03,088 --> 00:20:05,454
That doesn't make sense.

214
00:20:07,257 --> 00:20:09,452
l just said, my mom's gonna be back
on Monday!

215
00:20:09,892 --> 00:20:13,453
-ln two weeks, l'll be dead!
-Don't worry about it, honey.

216
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:18,157
Kids crash cars all the time.
That's why people get insurance.

217
00:20:21,535 --> 00:20:24,561
You're not on your mom's insurance,
are you?

218
00:20:26,372 --> 00:20:27,600
l'm dead.

219
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:36,141
Hey, Alvin! lt's in.

220
00:20:36,313 --> 00:20:38,144
You gotta check this out.

221
00:20:38,348 --> 00:20:41,283
lt's amazing how light this is.

222
00:20:41,484 --> 00:20:44,248
lt's hard to believe it's a camshaft.

223
00:20:47,588 --> 00:20:48,885
You know her?

224
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:53,587
-That's Paris Morgan.
-Will you explain to her...

225
00:20:54,293 --> 00:20:58,024
...that two weeks and 3 grand
is the best she can hope for?

226
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:00,323
Too bad her mama's
coming home on Monday.

227
00:21:00,498 --> 00:21:03,467
Out of that 3 grand...

228
00:21:03,633 --> 00:21:08,161
-...how much is in parts?
-l don't know. About 1500. Why?

229
00:21:11,239 --> 00:21:12,638
l'll be right back.

230
00:21:20,413 --> 00:21:22,210
Paris?

231
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:28,542
-Alan?
-Alvin.

232
00:21:31,055 --> 00:21:32,522
You do our pool, right?

233
00:21:33,256 --> 00:21:35,053
Yeah. You know...

234
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:38,616
...Ben's quoting you a really fair price.

235
00:21:39,427 --> 00:21:42,089
That's what l figured.

236
00:21:42,163 --> 00:21:43,494
l'm dead.

237
00:21:45,165 --> 00:21:47,099
Not necessarily.

238
00:21:49,501 --> 00:21:52,993
-What?
-l can have it done by Monday.

239
00:21:55,073 --> 00:21:57,940
-You can do it?
-The parts are only $ 1500.

240
00:21:58,075 --> 00:22:02,444
-l can have the labor done by this weekend.
-But l don't have $ 1500.

241
00:22:03,579 --> 00:22:05,137
l do.

242
00:22:08,283 --> 00:22:10,513
Let's back up here.

243
00:22:10,684 --> 00:22:13,915
Now, you're saying you're willing
to fix this car...

244
00:22:14,087 --> 00:22:17,420
-...this weekend and pay for the parts?
-Yeah.

245
00:22:17,622 --> 00:22:19,556
That's what I'm saying. Exactly.

246
00:22:19,724 --> 00:22:22,124
And what exactly do you want in return?

247
00:22:24,428 --> 00:22:29,024
-What, you think l'm some cheap ho?
-Wait. This has nothing to do with sex.

248
00:22:29,466 --> 00:22:31,024
You don't have to do anything.

249
00:22:31,533 --> 00:22:34,058
Just pretend.

250
00:22:34,268 --> 00:22:37,465
Pretend to be my girlfriend
for a couple of months.

251
00:22:39,272 --> 00:22:42,400
So you think that you can
buy me for $ 1500?

252
00:22:42,575 --> 00:22:45,066
No, no, no. Not buy you, just rent you.

253
00:22:46,478 --> 00:22:49,038
Did l mention this has nothing
to do with sex?

254
00:22:49,481 --> 00:22:52,678
Why would you want people
to think that l'm your girl?

255
00:22:53,484 --> 00:22:57,181
lt would make me popular.

256
00:23:09,529 --> 00:23:12,464
All right. One week.

257
00:23:14,699 --> 00:23:15,427
l'm your girl for one week.

258
00:23:16,367 --> 00:23:17,732
It has to be...

259
00:23:18,503 --> 00:23:19,697
...a month.

260
00:23:20,403 --> 00:23:24,100
-Two weeks! That's my final answer.
-Okay, two weeks. Perfect.

261
00:23:25,141 --> 00:23:29,077
-And you better not even think about sex.
-Yeah, yeah. Got it, got it.

262
00:23:30,511 --> 00:23:33,503
-And don't even look at my booty.
-Right. No booty licking.

263
00:23:34,547 --> 00:23:36,640
l mean, looking.

264
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:39,584
This is a sworn secret, right?

265
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:42,618
You can't tell anyone about our deal.
Promise?

266
00:23:43,021 --> 00:23:46,718
This is one thing I can guarantee
I will never admit to anyone.

267
00:23:47,423 --> 00:23:48,515
Pinky swear?

268
00:24:16,345 --> 00:24:17,676
You're not late.

269
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,207
My dad says all women
are 15 minutes late--

270
00:24:20,382 --> 00:24:22,475
You know what? Zip your mouth.

271
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:27,248
Do you own an iron?

272
00:24:27,421 --> 00:24:29,548
-Come here. Let me fix this.
-All right.

273
00:24:33,458 --> 00:24:34,356
All right.

274
00:24:40,096 --> 00:24:43,122
-Sorry.
-The pressure, the pressure.

275
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,798
Sorry, sorry. l'm really ready to go now.

276
00:24:46,734 --> 00:24:47,564
Hold on.

277
00:24:47,735 --> 00:24:49,259
Put this on.

278
00:24:49,437 --> 00:24:52,201
Whoa! Real Sean John!

279
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:53,669
All right!

280
00:24:54,408 --> 00:24:56,501
This rocks!

281
00:24:59,212 --> 00:25:02,340
-Okay, Alan, let's do this.
-Actually, Alvin.

282
00:25:02,514 --> 00:25:05,415
Like Al Green, because my sister
is actually named Aretha.

283
00:25:05,583 --> 00:25:07,414
Whatever.

284
00:25:18,092 --> 00:25:20,560
Yo, grinder, go home!

285
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:26,221
-Why is he in our hallway?
-Just be cool.

286
00:25:26,298 --> 00:25:29,267
-Wrong hall, cornball.
-Come on, boy.

287
00:25:29,434 --> 00:25:31,425
Bozo's lost again.

288
00:25:34,239 --> 00:25:36,173
Girl, you are tripping.

289
00:25:38,507 --> 00:25:39,667
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

290
00:25:41,243 --> 00:25:43,803
Hey, guys. You guys know Al, right?

291
00:25:44,345 --> 00:25:45,744
Why is Tito Jackson here?

292
00:25:49,316 --> 00:25:51,807
Come here, girl. We gotta talk.

293
00:25:53,253 --> 00:25:56,689
-Why is he rolling with you?
-Look, we're friends, all right?

294
00:25:56,855 --> 00:25:59,289
l'm just hanging with him. Okay?

295
00:25:59,357 --> 00:26:04,522
No, we're friends. Have you lost your mind?
Look at him.

296
00:26:04,594 --> 00:26:08,291
He looks like a buggawuf.
lt's gonna ruin your reputation.

297
00:26:08,797 --> 00:26:11,789
Hello? l'm the one hanging
with him, not you guys.

298
00:26:12,267 --> 00:26:14,132
Okay, but as the old saying goes:

299
00:26:14,269 --> 00:26:17,329
"Tell me who your friends are,
and l'll tell you who you are."

300
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:19,697
Well, as the new saying goes:

301
00:26:19,872 --> 00:26:24,206
"Tell me who your friends are, Yvonne,
and l'll tell you who you wanna be."

302
00:26:24,376 --> 00:26:26,105
-No, she didn't.
-Oh, yes, l did.

303
00:26:27,345 --> 00:26:28,869
Hurry up.

304
00:26:38,253 --> 00:26:41,780
Alvin, did you twist your ankle
or something?

305
00:26:42,189 --> 00:26:45,249
No. l'm just walking.

306
00:26:50,762 --> 00:26:55,426
Nice job sewing on that Sean John
label, buddy. Let me see that.

307
00:26:57,567 --> 00:27:00,365
Wait a minute. ls this real?
Real Sean John?

308
00:27:00,537 --> 00:27:04,132
-Where did you get this?
-Paris Morgan. She let me borrow it.

309
00:27:04,306 --> 00:27:05,739
Give it back!

310
00:27:05,941 --> 00:27:07,909
Paris Morgan?

311
00:27:08,276 --> 00:27:10,540
You expect us to believe
she lent you a sweatshirt?

312
00:27:10,945 --> 00:27:12,537
Why is that so hard to believe?

313
00:27:12,712 --> 00:27:15,510
Because it would imply that
she would speak to you.

314
00:27:15,681 --> 00:27:21,449
Not only did she speak to me,
we walked together. Lingered.

315
00:27:21,819 --> 00:27:24,151
We even had small conversation.

316
00:27:24,287 --> 00:27:27,381
Paris Morgan had this actual sweatshirt
on her actual body?

317
00:27:27,856 --> 00:27:29,915
-Yeah.
-Let me smell it one more time.

318
00:27:30,859 --> 00:27:31,826
Don't be that way, brother!

319
00:27:33,861 --> 00:27:35,829
That's a nice scent.
Wait, it's on fire!

320
00:27:37,397 --> 00:27:38,887
-Hose it down!
-Put it out!

321
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:43,427
-Turn the water on.
-What's going on, Mr. Johnson?

322
00:27:45,804 --> 00:27:47,738
Okay, it's out!

323
00:27:53,743 --> 00:27:56,507
-"Sean Jo."
-Could be Asian.

324
00:27:56,879 --> 00:27:59,473
Sean Jo.

325
00:27:59,681 --> 00:28:03,708
-Smell like burnt Paris Morgan now.
-That's how hot she is.

326
00:28:03,884 --> 00:28:05,784
That was a good one.

327
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:07,816
Okay, okay. Ladies, look and learn.

328
00:28:13,891 --> 00:28:16,382
Keep it gangster!

329
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:19,452
-Now, what do you call that?
-High maintenance.

330
00:28:19,663 --> 00:28:22,359
Dang, Ted. Didn't realize
you were so talented.

331
00:28:22,431 --> 00:28:26,527
Yo, Paris, you're the one who went
to the Halle Berry School for Driving.

332
00:28:27,002 --> 00:28:29,732
-Yeah, how you gonna fix that?
-lt's already fixed.

333
00:28:29,904 --> 00:28:31,337
Oh, come on, Ted.

334
00:28:31,538 --> 00:28:33,836
When homegirl is all quiet
and humble about it...

335
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,573
...it's because her rich
and famous boo, Mr. Dru...

336
00:28:37,743 --> 00:28:40,439
...paid for all that
to be corrected immediately.

337
00:28:40,978 --> 00:28:43,378
What's he gonna think
when he finds out...

338
00:28:43,447 --> 00:28:48,214
...you're volunteering for special ed,
rolling with that retard, Alvin?

339
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:52,651
You're the last person to be commenting
on someone's mental health, Kadeem.

340
00:28:52,821 --> 00:28:54,812
He's a grinder, not a retard.

341
00:28:55,757 --> 00:29:00,524
But on the real, Paris, he carries a pool net
around town, on a motorized scooter.

342
00:29:00,727 --> 00:29:04,823
You know, l don't believe
l granted an interview today.

343
00:29:21,943 --> 00:29:24,411
Hey. Hey, look.

344
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:30,616
-lt doesn't add up. lt doesn't make sense.
-He cleans her pool.

345
00:29:30,784 --> 00:29:33,582
l wanna clean pools.
Get to hang out with Paris Morgan.

346
00:29:33,786 --> 00:29:36,414
l'll clean the bathtub too.

347
00:29:37,422 --> 00:29:38,616
Yo, check this out, man.

348
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:41,759
Losers sit over there, to the left.

349
00:29:42,025 --> 00:29:43,754
You feel me?

350
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:48,590
Then l guess you'll be making a right.
That's the asshole section, Ted.

351
00:30:12,714 --> 00:30:16,377
You know what?
l think l'm gonna go get some dessert.

352
00:30:16,552 --> 00:30:19,919
You know, the Butterfingers
in the vending machine rock.

353
00:30:25,659 --> 00:30:29,652
You know, y'all don't have to be so rude,
staring at him like that.

354
00:30:30,028 --> 00:30:31,962
Why are you with him?

355
00:30:32,363 --> 00:30:35,924
l'm rolling with Al
because l'm with him, okay?

356
00:30:37,333 --> 00:30:38,561
Yeah.

357
00:30:41,837 --> 00:30:45,898
There you are.
Come on, let's bounce.

358
00:30:46,074 --> 00:30:49,532
There's a game tonight,
so scoop me up at 6:30?

359
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:52,543
l will be scooping you like Chunky Monkey.

360
00:30:57,449 --> 00:30:58,143
Slide, hit six...

361
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,949
...and kick.

362
00:31:01,351 --> 00:31:04,479
Pull. Land low.

363
00:31:04,554 --> 00:31:06,613
All right. Now shake it out.

364
00:31:07,389 --> 00:31:08,981
Shake it out. Good job, y'all.

365
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:12,518
-All right. Ready to have a good time?
-Give me my tape.

366
00:31:12,593 --> 00:31:16,586
lt's not your tape. lt's Dad's tape.
Take your Wonderbra and get out.

367
00:31:16,763 --> 00:31:20,529
And why would you need it anyway?
You know you'll never get to use it.

368
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,933
Oh, yeah? Well, guess what.

369
00:31:24,102 --> 00:31:27,503
-Thank you.
-Mom? Alvin's taking drugs.

370
00:31:27,571 --> 00:31:30,870
He's hallucinating.
He actually thinks he has a date tonight.

371
00:31:31,041 --> 00:31:33,009
-Why can't he?
-With Paris Morgan?

372
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:35,867
The most beautiful girl at school?
Dad, you bugging.

373
00:31:37,044 --> 00:31:39,774
-What that supposed to mean?
-Look at him.

374
00:31:39,947 --> 00:31:41,539
Where's the iron?

375
00:31:41,716 --> 00:31:46,517
lt's under the sink.
Are you feeling okay, honey?

376
00:31:46,585 --> 00:31:48,075
Mom, l'm great.

377
00:31:54,659 --> 00:31:56,490
See that? Drugs.

378
00:31:58,061 --> 00:32:01,792
-Do you think maybe l should--?
-No. Look here. Let me handle this here.

379
00:32:01,964 --> 00:32:04,831
He probably just needs a good
talking to, that's all.

380
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:11,034
Take it low.

381
00:32:11,438 --> 00:32:14,805
-Son? Come out and talk to your father.
-Shake it out.

382
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:18,603
Shake it out. Good. Have fun with it.
Take it to the side.

383
00:32:18,777 --> 00:32:23,544
Take it low. Do what you wanna do.
It's the shake-off.

384
00:32:28,551 --> 00:32:30,485
Come on, take a seat.

385
00:32:31,653 --> 00:32:36,647
Come on. Gotta get your sea legs. Might
wanna get yourself a waterbed one day.

386
00:32:36,858 --> 00:32:40,385
There ain't a woman born
that can resist...

387
00:32:40,561 --> 00:32:41,994
...the motion...

388
00:32:42,161 --> 00:32:44,152
...of the ocean.

389
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:48,523
Dad, l gotta iron my clothes.

390
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,565
No, no, no.
Don't worry about that.

391
00:32:50,768 --> 00:32:53,532
Because nothing right now can rob me...

392
00:32:53,736 --> 00:32:56,637
...of this rite of passage
between the father and his son.

393
00:32:56,806 --> 00:32:58,899
Me and you right now, it's big.

394
00:33:00,943 --> 00:33:02,672
And kick.

395
00:33:03,544 --> 00:33:06,945
Jump, jump.
And mambo.

396
00:33:07,113 --> 00:33:11,072
Now kick him in the nuts, girl.
Kick him in the face. And punch.

397
00:33:11,482 --> 00:33:12,642
Chop, chop.

398
00:33:14,018 --> 00:33:15,849
This here, son...

399
00:33:16,587 --> 00:33:18,680
...is your hope chest.

400
00:33:22,992 --> 00:33:26,951
This is my legacy to you.

401
00:33:33,167 --> 00:33:36,967
A hope chest?

402
00:33:45,609 --> 00:33:48,737
They come in all different sizes
and colors.

403
00:33:50,814 --> 00:33:52,611
Let me talk to you, son.

404
00:33:52,681 --> 00:33:55,445
This right here, son--
Look at me, boy. Watch this here.

405
00:33:55,617 --> 00:34:01,556
This is the Trojan ribbed, lubricated.
Sturdy, reliable, dependable. Like a truck.

406
00:34:01,722 --> 00:34:06,455
When you don't really know what you into,
and it get a little rough for you...

407
00:34:06,591 --> 00:34:08,855
...makes you downshift.

408
00:34:10,829 --> 00:34:12,592
This one here, son....

409
00:34:13,663 --> 00:34:16,131
This is the super-size...

410
00:34:17,166 --> 00:34:18,861
...Magnum majestic.

411
00:34:19,035 --> 00:34:22,801
The prophylactic Cadillac.

412
00:34:23,005 --> 00:34:24,233
Oh, yeah.

413
00:34:25,172 --> 00:34:27,663
This is when you find yourself
and you're there.

414
00:34:27,741 --> 00:34:32,110
You done got so comfortable with yourself
you done built up a reputation.

415
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:34,105
You feel me?

416
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:37,477
And this one here, son,
be extra careful...

417
00:34:37,649 --> 00:34:40,015
...because that's
Mr. Little Extra Sensitive.

418
00:34:40,183 --> 00:34:43,118
You really don't need this,
especially on the first round.

419
00:34:43,286 --> 00:34:47,950
You'll enjoy the ride too much, end up on
the curb somewhere out of commission.

420
00:34:48,156 --> 00:34:51,489
You don't want that.
Save this for round three.

421
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:54,754
Because believe me,
there's gonna be a round three.

422
00:34:55,796 --> 00:34:58,128
Look at me. Feel me.

423
00:34:58,298 --> 00:35:00,892
All right, now, look strong. Come on, son.

424
00:35:01,066 --> 00:35:02,863
Close your mouth. There you go.

425
00:35:03,035 --> 00:35:04,764
Keep it tight. Work with it.

426
00:35:06,203 --> 00:35:07,135
Love you, man.

427
00:35:10,707 --> 00:35:13,005
--seven eight, and chop, chop.

428
00:35:13,208 --> 00:35:14,971
And mambo. Lucy Liu!

429
00:35:15,177 --> 00:35:19,170
Now kick him in the nuts, girl.
Kick him in the face. And punch.

430
00:35:19,579 --> 00:35:22,139
Chop, chop. Yeah. Mambo.

431
00:35:22,549 --> 00:35:25,712
Lucy Liu, now.
Kick him in the back, the face.

432
00:35:25,885 --> 00:35:29,286
Punch. Chop, chop. Mambo.

433
00:35:30,221 --> 00:35:34,817
Lucy Liu. Now kick him in the nuts, girl.
Kick him in the face. Step, punch.

434
00:35:36,226 --> 00:35:38,626
Girl, you know better than that.

435
00:35:38,795 --> 00:35:42,526
You better put that chicken wing
down, okay?

436
00:35:42,698 --> 00:35:46,998
I see you, girl.
Five, six, seven, eight, down.

437
00:35:48,068 --> 00:35:49,831
And wiggle.

438
00:35:50,003 --> 00:35:51,834
And shimmy.

439
00:35:52,005 --> 00:35:53,666
And five and six and....

440
00:36:04,314 --> 00:36:05,645
Touch yourself, come on.

441
00:36:05,815 --> 00:36:08,215
Hold me tight. Yes.

442
00:36:15,722 --> 00:36:17,656
Oh, hell, no.

443
00:36:19,926 --> 00:36:23,020
-Hey, fellas, how you doing?
-Hey, Mr. Johnson. What's going on?

444
00:36:23,228 --> 00:36:25,128
Look, l got a bit of bad news for you.

445
00:36:25,296 --> 00:36:29,289
lt seems like Alvin done moved.
He don't stay here no more.

446
00:36:29,999 --> 00:36:31,728
This has ceased to be funny.

447
00:36:31,801 --> 00:36:33,928
Hey, ain't nobody playing with you,
now.

448
00:36:34,103 --> 00:36:37,766
Listen to me. l know you been friends
with Alvin since first grade...

449
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,569
...but Alvin dating a girl now.

450
00:36:39,741 --> 00:36:42,972
He don't need to be hanging around
y'all scientific-looking ass...

451
00:36:43,143 --> 00:36:44,735
...no more.

452
00:36:44,945 --> 00:36:46,105
Stop all that, now.

453
00:36:46,278 --> 00:36:50,009
-Y'all take it easy, okay?
-Come on, Mr. Johnson!

454
00:36:50,182 --> 00:36:52,776
Get your big, wide ass off the door.

455
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:56,351
You gonna mess around, and l'm gonna
get my Roto-Rooter and stick it--

456
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:00,087
-Come on in!
-All right, yeah. Exactly. Let me in.

457
00:37:01,991 --> 00:37:03,959
Alvin, your dad's funny.

458
00:37:10,864 --> 00:37:12,889
So, what's going on?

459
00:37:15,667 --> 00:37:16,998
l'm not asking him.

460
00:37:18,804 --> 00:37:24,208
Okay, look, well, we always sit together
at the games in the visitors section, and....

461
00:37:24,374 --> 00:37:26,706
Well, are you going to sit with us...

462
00:37:26,877 --> 00:37:30,074
...or in the home seats
with the popular kids?

463
00:37:30,279 --> 00:37:34,238
Yeah, see, we were thinking that we'd sit
in the home section with you...

464
00:37:34,649 --> 00:37:36,810
...so you could introduce us
to Paris Morgan.

465
00:37:36,984 --> 00:37:38,884
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

466
00:37:41,154 --> 00:37:43,782
-Of course you can!
-All right!

467
00:37:43,855 --> 00:37:47,621
So did you and Paris, you know, do it?

468
00:37:47,759 --> 00:37:51,786
-Do what?
-lt! lt, it, it! Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

469
00:37:51,862 --> 00:37:53,887
Yeah! Yeah!

470
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:56,054
Sorry, guys.

471
00:37:57,333 --> 00:37:58,925
l'm not telling.

472
00:37:59,134 --> 00:38:00,624
Dogpile!

473
00:38:36,796 --> 00:38:38,764
These are for you.

474
00:38:40,466 --> 00:38:43,060
They're Arabian roses.

475
00:38:43,234 --> 00:38:47,671
Alvin, that's so sweet,
but you shouldn't have.

476
00:38:49,973 --> 00:38:53,340
Girls see a guy being too nice...

477
00:38:53,741 --> 00:38:57,438
...and it makes him seem lonely,
desperate, weak.

478
00:38:57,811 --> 00:39:00,006
-Right, right. l should write this down.
-No.

479
00:39:00,214 --> 00:39:04,913
Look, just be a little tougher. You know?
Make like you don't need me.

480
00:39:05,083 --> 00:39:07,847
Like you don't need any girl.

481
00:39:07,919 --> 00:39:09,443
Then girls will want you.

482
00:39:10,388 --> 00:39:11,047
-Okay?
-Okay.

483
00:39:11,222 --> 00:39:13,019
But the flowers, they're nice.

484
00:39:13,223 --> 00:39:16,954
Look, l'll go put them in water,
and then we'll go to the game, all right?

485
00:39:18,327 --> 00:39:19,885
You stay right there. Okay?

486
00:39:32,972 --> 00:39:34,064
Basket!

487
00:39:34,874 --> 00:39:36,102
Assist, Sanders!

488
00:39:36,274 --> 00:39:39,004
-Sit down, clowns!
-Dumb-asses!

489
00:39:39,176 --> 00:39:41,201
Sit down, Q-Tip!

490
00:39:47,083 --> 00:39:53,352
Jackrabbits! Jackrabbits!
Jackrabbits! Jackrabbits!

491
00:39:59,859 --> 00:40:00,951
-Hi, Paris!
-Hi, Paris!

492
00:40:01,126 --> 00:40:02,855
-Hi, Paris!
-Come on.

493
00:40:03,028 --> 00:40:05,019
All right, guys, that's enough.

494
00:40:05,229 --> 00:40:07,823
She's working.
Leave her alone.

495
00:40:09,866 --> 00:40:12,027
What a wankster.

496
00:40:19,039 --> 00:40:22,497
And now, the Jackrabbit drill squad.

497
00:40:37,787 --> 00:40:39,914
Left, right

498
00:40:40,122 --> 00:40:44,923
-Chuck, have some couth.
-Yeah, it's just breasts and bottoms, damn!

499
00:40:47,328 --> 00:40:48,420
Hey! Hey!

500
00:40:48,829 --> 00:40:50,126
My mom bought those for me!

501
00:40:50,297 --> 00:40:53,232
-One time! One time!
-Why are you like that?

502
00:40:54,266 --> 00:40:56,131
You pretty.

503
00:41:24,323 --> 00:41:25,483
She's perfect.

504
00:41:30,161 --> 00:41:33,392
Move. Move. Move.
What are you doing, sitting in my section?

505
00:41:33,562 --> 00:41:36,429
You hungry? Wanna offer pizza?
Let me offer some for you.

506
00:41:36,832 --> 00:41:39,926
Home is down with your man.
Stay out of my section, all right?

507
00:41:40,168 --> 00:41:42,398
Losers sit over there, to the left!

508
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:57,810
What are you, a big fake?

509
00:42:03,185 --> 00:42:04,550
Alvin?

510
00:42:06,253 --> 00:42:10,417
-Alvin!
-The deal is off.

511
00:42:11,025 --> 00:42:15,018
Just go. Go be with your friends
while they still claim you.

512
00:42:15,595 --> 00:42:17,563
Come down out of that tree.

513
00:42:19,198 --> 00:42:22,361
We still have a lot of time
to pretend we're friends.

514
00:42:22,532 --> 00:42:25,501
And unlike some people,
l keep my promises.

515
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:29,467
You mean, unlike Dru?

516
00:42:41,014 --> 00:42:42,447
Are you okay? Alvin?

517
00:42:42,614 --> 00:42:47,108
You know, these next two weeks,
if it's any consolation...

518
00:42:47,285 --> 00:42:50,482
...are probably gonna be
the happiest memories of my life.

519
00:42:53,657 --> 00:42:55,955
You can't be serious.

520
00:42:56,125 --> 00:42:59,583
Alvin, we've had one rejection
after another.

521
00:43:06,065 --> 00:43:10,024
Now, are those the kind of victories
you really want in life?

522
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:14,868
No, not really.

523
00:43:18,409 --> 00:43:21,071
Then l say we do something about it.

524
00:43:27,115 --> 00:43:28,878
Come on.

525
00:44:48,477 --> 00:44:50,240
What happened to your hair?

526
00:44:52,646 --> 00:44:57,140
Probably need to roll your pants up
just a little bit.

527
00:44:57,316 --> 00:45:00,285
Oh, see, these is Sean John.

528
00:45:01,086 --> 00:45:04,954
So l gotta get my swing on.

529
00:45:06,657 --> 00:45:08,955
Son, what has happened to your priorities?

530
00:45:10,025 --> 00:45:14,257
Oh, no, see, it was all about
what was under the hood.

531
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:18,298
Now l'm trying to be on top
of the hood.

532
00:45:21,668 --> 00:45:22,635
Because l'm a baller-tician...

533
00:45:23,036 --> 00:45:25,368
...on a mission. Holler.

534
00:45:26,105 --> 00:45:27,470
Urkel has gone gangster.

535
00:45:28,406 --> 00:45:31,170
Probably need to go in here,
say something to this boy.

536
00:45:31,342 --> 00:45:33,173
Here we go.

537
00:45:42,650 --> 00:45:48,611
Your mother wants me to talk to you
about what's gotten into you.

538
00:45:51,525 --> 00:45:56,519
But what l wanna talk about
is who you're getting into.

539
00:45:58,163 --> 00:46:00,757
What is that, boy? What is that?

540
00:46:01,665 --> 00:46:04,395
You'll need more money
if you're trying to scratch that kitty-cat.

541
00:46:04,567 --> 00:46:06,694
Let me help you out, son.

542
00:46:08,037 --> 00:46:09,163
Thanks, Dad.

543
00:46:09,338 --> 00:46:13,638
Boy, been waiting a long time
for that right there. And that's not all.

544
00:46:14,041 --> 00:46:16,339
Got it for you right here.

545
00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:18,107
Yeah.

546
00:46:18,311 --> 00:46:22,441
Dad, l think l still have a few left
from the boxful you gave me last night.

547
00:46:22,614 --> 00:46:27,176
Boy, you won't use these cheap suckers
right here. These is for practice.

548
00:46:27,351 --> 00:46:31,185
Come here, let me show you what
l'm talking about. Sit down right there.

549
00:46:33,323 --> 00:46:36,156
Listen to me. You gotta be able
to know how to do this...

550
00:46:36,357 --> 00:46:38,222
...with the ease of a true player.

551
00:46:38,293 --> 00:46:42,195
Because nothing kill a mood quicker
than you sitting up there wrestling...

552
00:46:42,262 --> 00:46:45,231
...trying to get your raincoat
on your little rascal.

553
00:46:45,298 --> 00:46:47,766
Now, go on,
open one of them, right there.

554
00:46:49,335 --> 00:46:51,200
Take your time.

555
00:46:53,170 --> 00:46:54,398
Work with it. There.

556
00:47:03,245 --> 00:47:04,542
Okay.

557
00:47:04,713 --> 00:47:07,511
That was good, son.
That was real good. Two problems.

558
00:47:07,715 --> 00:47:10,309
Number one, too slow,
girl probably asleep.

559
00:47:10,483 --> 00:47:13,714
Second problem, you used two hands.

560
00:47:14,086 --> 00:47:16,418
You a Johnson.
We one-hand people.

561
00:47:17,188 --> 00:47:18,815
Make you look a lot smoother.

562
00:47:19,724 --> 00:47:20,588
Here we go.

563
00:47:27,730 --> 00:47:30,631
Little rusty, that's all.

564
00:47:40,874 --> 00:47:43,172
Sorry about that, boy.

565
00:47:45,377 --> 00:47:48,244
l want you to practice unrolling one.

566
00:47:49,447 --> 00:47:52,780
No, don't worry about that.
You a Johnson.

567
00:47:53,883 --> 00:47:54,713
l got you, right here.

568
00:47:55,118 --> 00:47:56,346
Go on, slide that on there.

569
00:47:56,519 --> 00:47:59,511
You practice on that right now.
l'll be right back.

570
00:48:03,891 --> 00:48:06,291
Here we go, right here.

571
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:09,227
All the practicing in the world
ain't gonna do you good...

572
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:12,420
...if you kill too much time
and you lose the mood.

573
00:48:12,597 --> 00:48:18,297
l'm about to give you my number one,
smooth-groove jam...

574
00:48:18,368 --> 00:48:22,862
...guaranteed to set the mood
just like you need it.

575
00:48:23,239 --> 00:48:26,606
Stay with me, boy. This big.

576
00:48:35,714 --> 00:48:36,874
Go on, feel it.

577
00:48:37,851 --> 00:48:40,319
Come on, now,
you're Clarence Johnson's boy.

578
00:48:41,386 --> 00:48:42,546
Wet your lips.

579
00:48:42,754 --> 00:48:44,881
Gotta get them wet. Go on.

580
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:48,383
You got them wet like that?
Now, there it is.

581
00:48:48,557 --> 00:48:50,422
You know what?
She wants you now.

582
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:54,320
You're a Johnson man.
All you got to do is lay back...

583
00:48:54,496 --> 00:48:58,432
...let her come on into your world.
Let her slide right on up on the kitchen.

584
00:48:58,632 --> 00:49:01,123
Because you fixed to start cooking.
Oh, yeah.

585
00:49:01,267 --> 00:49:04,395
Just go to work. When you hold her,
got to get her like that.

586
00:49:04,570 --> 00:49:07,630
She starts sliding right on down
where you got to have it.

587
00:49:07,806 --> 00:49:10,274
Get up under there.
lt's all good for you.

588
00:49:10,474 --> 00:49:13,910
Then you make your move.
You slide around on her.

589
00:49:14,277 --> 00:49:17,474
Then you're in control.
Lock on. Here we go!

590
00:49:17,646 --> 00:49:20,308
Along for the ride, baby!

591
00:49:21,449 --> 00:49:24,714
You gonna learn to scratch that kitty-cat
and you're gonna love it!

592
00:49:24,886 --> 00:49:26,683
You can run but you can't hide!

593
00:49:27,421 --> 00:49:29,889
That's why they call you Johnson!

594
00:49:33,626 --> 00:49:36,151
ls that what you're teaching our son?

595
00:49:38,729 --> 00:49:40,697
The boy going to get some.

596
00:49:40,864 --> 00:49:44,698
The boy been working hard
trying not to go crazy.

597
00:49:45,835 --> 00:49:49,202
Maybe you ought to just let the boy
have some fun.

598
00:50:02,648 --> 00:50:03,842
ls that our song?

599
00:50:06,483 --> 00:50:07,814
Sounds like it to me.

600
00:50:08,852 --> 00:50:10,410
Really?

601
00:50:16,458 --> 00:50:18,483
Watch out, now.
Let me help you with that.

602
00:50:22,962 --> 00:50:26,420
-Hold up, might need a little rope.
-Daddy, don't you do it.

603
00:50:54,887 --> 00:50:56,514
-Paris?
-lt's her mother.

604
00:50:58,823 --> 00:51:02,554
God. Get up out of my bushes!
What is your problem?

605
00:51:02,725 --> 00:51:06,422
-Are you okay?
-l'm cool.

606
00:51:06,596 --> 00:51:09,326
You were just here.
Did l forget to pay you last week?

607
00:51:09,498 --> 00:51:11,557
-No, actually--
-Hey, Mom. l'm out of here.

608
00:51:11,732 --> 00:51:12,960
Love you, see you.

609
00:51:13,634 --> 00:51:14,965
Sorry.

610
00:51:16,570 --> 00:51:17,798
These kids.

611
00:51:18,570 --> 00:51:20,504
So you know all this stuff about cars.

612
00:51:20,673 --> 00:51:24,006
Now, you mean, you've never thought
about getting one of your own?

613
00:51:24,909 --> 00:51:27,810
Not to brag or anything,
but l was chosen as one of three finalists...

614
00:51:27,979 --> 00:51:30,777
...in the General Motors
Young Engineers Competition.

615
00:51:30,947 --> 00:51:32,938
lt's for a full-ride scholarship.

616
00:51:34,050 --> 00:51:35,244
Dang! Look at you.

617
00:51:35,417 --> 00:51:38,784
Here l am sweating you, player,
about not having a car...

618
00:51:38,953 --> 00:51:41,444
...and you know how to make one.

619
00:51:41,922 --> 00:51:43,753
l hope you win.

620
00:51:44,658 --> 00:51:46,023
Yeah.

621
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,660
l think l definitely could have won.

622
00:51:49,829 --> 00:51:54,698
You know, the design was great,
it ran awesome.

623
00:51:55,533 --> 00:51:58,934
lt just needed a stronger,
lighter camshaft.

624
00:52:00,670 --> 00:52:05,573
What, am l missing something?
How come you didn't go out and buy one?

625
00:52:05,773 --> 00:52:08,435
lt cost $ 1500.

626
00:52:22,786 --> 00:52:24,777
Are you serious?

627
00:52:26,322 --> 00:52:27,789
There's still a chance.

628
00:52:29,592 --> 00:52:33,585
And if not, hey,
l got all my life to be an engineer.

629
00:52:34,126 --> 00:52:37,061
The last semester in high school...

630
00:52:37,995 --> 00:52:39,724
...only comes around once.

631
00:52:45,201 --> 00:52:50,730
l haven't really been on too many dates
in the last 16 or 17 years.

632
00:52:51,673 --> 00:52:53,834
l hope l do okay.

633
00:52:56,810 --> 00:52:58,801
You'll do great.

634
00:53:02,547 --> 00:53:04,913
Slide over. You drive.

635
00:53:36,707 --> 00:53:39,733
Nice Expo. Problem is, it's a '98.

636
00:53:39,909 --> 00:53:42,742
What the hell do you know about cars?

637
00:53:48,717 --> 00:53:50,116
Well...

638
00:53:51,318 --> 00:53:54,754
...'98s, there's a little shortage
in the battery cable.

639
00:53:54,921 --> 00:53:58,186
lt's nothing a rubber insulation
can't fix, though.

640
00:53:59,057 --> 00:54:00,547
Pulling out a condom.

641
00:54:08,231 --> 00:54:10,665
Go ahead, check it out.
Give it a try.

642
00:54:10,866 --> 00:54:13,164
You're gonna fix my car with a rubber?

643
00:54:25,978 --> 00:54:27,343
Yeah.

644
00:54:43,256 --> 00:54:48,023
When you were doing your thizzle earlier,
you were off the hizzle.

645
00:54:48,228 --> 00:54:50,822
Yeah. What kind of car do you drizzle?

646
00:54:52,164 --> 00:54:54,724
-Drizzle--?
-He's designing and constructing one...

647
00:54:54,932 --> 00:54:56,229
...from the ground up...

648
00:54:56,634 --> 00:54:59,797
...which, as of yet, has no reference
in layman's terms.

649
00:54:59,870 --> 00:55:03,271
Yeah, so basically, you don't have a car.

650
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:07,332
Well, l never had a rich pops
to buy me anything...

651
00:55:08,275 --> 00:55:11,210
...so l'm just a working man
trying to come up.

652
00:55:11,844 --> 00:55:14,210
Yeah, you cool, man.

653
00:55:15,648 --> 00:55:17,878
l'm not feeling this cat.

654
00:55:33,128 --> 00:55:36,757
So let me tell you about the time
when l was fixing this police car...

655
00:55:36,964 --> 00:55:40,832
...on the side of the highway.
She had that outfit on, the brown one--

656
00:55:41,968 --> 00:55:44,732
-Hey, baby.
-l need to talk to you.

657
00:55:44,904 --> 00:55:46,269
Now.

658
00:55:46,871 --> 00:55:48,736
Fellas, y'all have to excuse me.

659
00:55:50,675 --> 00:55:53,735
You are a genius! This is working great!
You're so brilliant.

660
00:55:56,446 --> 00:55:58,880
-You look upset.
-l am.

661
00:55:59,449 --> 00:56:01,974
-At what?
-While you were fronting...

662
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:05,244
...like you're some player,
l was outside waiting for you.

663
00:56:05,418 --> 00:56:07,852
We have a deal.

664
00:56:07,921 --> 00:56:10,947
-We walk the hall together, remember?
-Sorry--

665
00:56:16,794 --> 00:56:21,254
Look, Alvin, l think you're starting
to feel yourself a little too much.

666
00:56:21,431 --> 00:56:23,763
l do not do that.
My mother said you'll go blind!

667
00:56:23,934 --> 00:56:25,299
Whatever.

668
00:56:27,002 --> 00:56:30,768
Look, just don't ever
keep me waiting again.

669
00:56:41,346 --> 00:56:43,871
-Hey, we'll catch up with y'all.
-All right, guys.

670
00:56:44,048 --> 00:56:46,107
l can't believe this, dude....

671
00:56:47,351 --> 00:56:48,978
What's the matter?
l mean, l said l was sorry.

672
00:56:49,185 --> 00:56:51,676
l got caught up.
l was hanging with my friends--

673
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:54,118
The friends who gave you
a pepperoni facial?

674
00:56:54,289 --> 00:56:56,120
Look, we squashed all that.

675
00:56:56,290 --> 00:56:59,020
lt's a lot of work, Alvin.
The whole interior.

676
00:56:59,193 --> 00:57:01,024
We wanted you to be there.

677
00:57:01,195 --> 00:57:02,355
Okay, look.

678
00:57:02,729 --> 00:57:05,698
We'll get together this weekend,
we'll work on the car.

679
00:57:05,831 --> 00:57:08,857
lt'll be like old times.
We'll have a good time.

680
00:57:08,934 --> 00:57:13,166
Great, Friday night. We'll get to work on
reupholstering the inside of the seats--

681
00:57:13,371 --> 00:57:15,805
Friday, Friday....

682
00:57:15,973 --> 00:57:19,306
-l can't do it. l got plans.
-Well, Saturday, then.

683
00:57:20,009 --> 00:57:22,341
Saturday's not good for me either.

684
00:57:22,744 --> 00:57:24,837
You know what?
Sunday afternoon.

685
00:57:25,379 --> 00:57:27,040
Yeah. Great. Sunday.

686
00:57:30,316 --> 00:57:31,476
Yeah.

687
00:57:32,385 --> 00:57:34,876
-Gonna introduce me?
-You met them in fourth grade, remember?

688
00:57:34,953 --> 00:57:36,978
What's going on?

689
00:57:37,956 --> 00:57:39,947
What's the deal?

690
00:57:40,224 --> 00:57:42,488
Life is good. You all right?

691
00:58:13,316 --> 00:58:14,840
Hello?

692
00:58:16,218 --> 00:58:17,776
Paris?

693
00:58:18,787 --> 00:58:21,312
Yo, Paris!

694
00:58:37,167 --> 00:58:40,034
What are you doing
just walking in my house?

695
00:58:41,437 --> 00:58:44,873
The door was open. My bad.

696
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:48,009
l heard you playing your guitar, though.
lt sound hot.

697
00:58:49,109 --> 00:58:51,168
What are you even doing here?

698
00:58:52,445 --> 00:58:56,438
lt's the last day in our two-week contract.
l thought we'd hang out.

699
00:58:58,317 --> 00:59:00,251
Let me hear you play.

700
00:59:03,453 --> 00:59:05,318
Come on.

701
00:59:07,590 --> 00:59:10,024
Look, l'm still learning...

702
00:59:10,191 --> 00:59:15,254
...and the lyrics l wrote
don't go with my melody yet.

703
00:59:20,166 --> 00:59:23,192
l'll read. You play.

704
00:59:26,971 --> 00:59:28,802
Come on.

705
00:59:50,356 --> 00:59:52,551
"And l rise.

706
00:59:53,558 --> 00:59:57,119
ln spite of my fear inside...

707
00:59:57,427 --> 01:00:00,328
...caused by those who have burned me
with their lies.

708
01:00:01,331 --> 01:00:03,356
And l rise.

709
01:00:19,511 --> 01:00:21,308
And l rise."

710
01:00:28,418 --> 01:00:30,113
Look....

711
01:00:33,188 --> 01:00:35,850
Go on, get dressed.

712
01:00:36,190 --> 01:00:37,589
Why?

713
01:00:38,358 --> 01:00:42,454
No more questions. Get dressed.

714
01:01:06,213 --> 01:01:08,204
To my relationships that didn't work

715
01:01:08,381 --> 01:01:11,077
Map of this human heart
Starts at the age of 15

716
01:01:11,150 --> 01:01:13,311
When I lost my virginity
To a lady, older

717
01:01:13,519 --> 01:01:16,113
Like most boys
It was based on the lies I told her

718
01:01:16,321 --> 01:01:19,654
I had so much to prove
Like I had more experience

719
01:01:20,557 --> 01:01:22,320
Than she thought I knew
And though it wasn't true

720
01:01:22,492 --> 01:01:23,652
It was amazing

721
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:26,357
But it ended because I did
What most young boys do

722
01:01:26,562 --> 01:01:29,531
Listened to the lies of a fool
Which led to this girl

723
01:01:29,931 --> 01:01:32,058
Getting socked in the jaw
In the middle of school

724
01:01:32,232 --> 01:01:34,393
Even though I didn't do it
I felt to blame

725
01:01:34,567 --> 01:01:38,128
Because the girl who hit her was the cousin
Of my man who was salting my game

726
01:01:38,304 --> 01:01:40,272
Nowadays it just don't seem cool

727
01:01:40,439 --> 01:01:42,430
Tell me what the hell
Am I supposed to do?

728
01:01:42,607 --> 01:01:45,098
And then a wise man gave me a clue

729
01:01:45,176 --> 01:01:48,475
He said
"The only way out is the way through "

730
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:52,510
You know, it's silly...

731
01:01:53,215 --> 01:01:55,445
...but instead of this whole...

732
01:01:56,317 --> 01:02:00,014
..."drill team/Dru Hilton's girl" thing...

733
01:02:00,620 --> 01:02:05,455
...what l really, really always dream about
is just going somewhere.

734
01:02:07,493 --> 01:02:09,688
Somewhere where nobody knows me.

735
01:02:10,061 --> 01:02:12,655
Just being this girl with, like,
crazy cool dreads...

736
01:02:13,297 --> 01:02:17,393
...and a guitar and--
Oh, never mind, it's really dumb.

737
01:02:21,336 --> 01:02:22,701
You know...

738
01:02:23,604 --> 01:02:25,265
...you could bring your guitar here.

739
01:02:27,508 --> 01:02:30,272
No, l can't.

740
01:02:32,479 --> 01:02:36,939
No, you mean you won't.

741
01:02:54,461 --> 01:02:56,725
This is beautiful.

742
01:03:01,534 --> 01:03:03,593
You know, Al...

743
01:03:04,302 --> 01:03:09,330
...there's something
that we've been avoiding all day.

744
01:03:09,506 --> 01:03:12,304
Something that maybe we ought to do.

745
01:03:13,475 --> 01:03:15,534
You know what, you're right.

746
01:03:15,744 --> 01:03:18,542
This might sound kind of silly...

747
01:03:20,714 --> 01:03:22,682
...but how do we do it?

748
01:03:23,683 --> 01:03:25,207
Well....

749
01:03:26,586 --> 01:03:30,249
Just go for it, you know?
Just do it.

750
01:03:32,724 --> 01:03:34,248
Okay.

751
01:03:41,030 --> 01:03:44,261
We'll break up first thing
tomorrow morning.

752
01:03:44,332 --> 01:03:49,269
ln the hallway, so everybody can see.
l mean, make a big scene.

753
01:03:49,470 --> 01:03:54,407
But a dignified scene because,
you know, we gotta protect our reps.

754
01:03:54,607 --> 01:03:58,338
Did you hear what l just said?
Our reps!

755
01:03:59,244 --> 01:04:02,702
Al Johnson has a rep to protect!

756
01:04:04,815 --> 01:04:06,715
Player, player.

757
01:04:08,050 --> 01:04:12,749
Come on, girl, put a pep in your step.
We got school in the morning!

758
01:04:53,252 --> 01:04:57,313
Now, those are the benefits of being raised
in a household with vinyl and 8-track.

759
01:04:57,521 --> 01:05:02,220
-You know, old school for real.
-Damn, man, you got all the 411.

760
01:05:02,291 --> 01:05:04,316
l'm talking Earth, Wind and Fire.

761
01:05:04,527 --> 01:05:07,360
-"Erf," E with a F at the end of it.
-Al?

762
01:05:07,562 --> 01:05:10,429
-Here comes your girl.
-Al, l need to talk to you.

763
01:05:10,598 --> 01:05:13,294
Don't you see grown men
are talking here?

764
01:05:14,834 --> 01:05:19,203
Anyway, you know, as l was saying,
you know, Ohio Players--

765
01:05:19,404 --> 01:05:21,395
Al, we need to talk.

766
01:05:21,572 --> 01:05:25,702
What's up with this "we, we" stuff?
This ain't French class. Ain't no "we."

767
01:05:26,243 --> 01:05:27,608
l'm a free agent now.

768
01:05:30,279 --> 01:05:34,375
-That was cruel.
-Sometimes you gotta be cruel to be kind.

769
01:05:34,816 --> 01:05:37,842
That's how you keep a lady in check,
you know what l'm saying?

770
01:05:40,854 --> 01:05:42,515
You still here?

771
01:05:42,723 --> 01:05:45,521
Bounce. Giddyup.

772
01:05:46,292 --> 01:05:48,317
Damn.

773
01:05:48,493 --> 01:05:51,326
Too many fish in the sea
for her to be hounding me.

774
01:05:51,495 --> 01:05:54,191
-l'm feeling this.
-l hear you, boy.

775
01:05:54,397 --> 01:05:56,228
She gonna be back too. Watch.

776
01:05:56,431 --> 01:05:59,696
Did you just see
how he just dogged Paris?

777
01:06:00,435 --> 01:06:04,269
-l want a strong brother like that.
-Yep.

778
01:06:04,338 --> 01:06:09,503
Look at him, standing there looking
better than a butter-leather Prada bag.

779
01:06:32,793 --> 01:06:36,126
You got a lot of nerve dissing me
the way you did.

780
01:06:37,763 --> 01:06:41,358
Yeah, l know, that's why
l came by, to apologize.

781
01:06:41,533 --> 01:06:43,626
But, yo, Oscar goes to you.

782
01:06:47,671 --> 01:06:51,539
Hey, l just really want to say thank you
for a great couple of weeks.

783
01:06:51,708 --> 01:06:54,302
Well, l was just doing
what l said l would do.

784
01:06:54,376 --> 01:06:55,707
And it worked.

785
01:06:55,877 --> 01:06:59,870
l mean, popularity is so much better
than being treated like a social leper.

786
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:04,348
Popularity's a job, Alvin.
Not a privilege.

787
01:07:04,418 --> 01:07:06,318
lt's nothing but work and worries.

788
01:07:06,552 --> 01:07:09,919
Work to get in, work to stay in.

789
01:07:10,288 --> 01:07:12,449
Get a clue.

790
01:07:24,465 --> 01:07:26,456
You're killing them, dog.

791
01:07:31,571 --> 01:07:33,937
Morning, dime pieces.

792
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:37,274
Your gear is real tight today, boo.

793
01:07:37,475 --> 01:07:42,811
Appreciate it. You know,
Nike, Burberry, Gucci, Scooby-Doo.

794
01:07:43,747 --> 01:07:46,375
You're taking me to Jerry's
Friday night, right?

795
01:07:46,849 --> 01:07:50,478
Sure. l mean...

796
01:07:50,752 --> 01:07:54,620
...how could l say no
to a breezy like you?

797
01:07:54,854 --> 01:07:56,412
For real?

798
01:07:56,590 --> 01:08:00,720
Real is all l am, baby.

799
01:08:01,860 --> 01:08:03,828
l'll holler.

800
01:08:07,531 --> 01:08:11,797
Yvonne, he just broke up with Paris
less than 24 hours ago.

801
01:08:12,836 --> 01:08:14,770
You just mad l beat you to him.

802
01:08:20,975 --> 01:08:25,742
It's Yvonne.
You're all mine tomorrow night.

803
01:08:27,646 --> 01:08:28,874
You know, Yolanda, my big girl,
we're gonna need the whole back seat.

804
01:08:31,349 --> 01:08:35,683
Girls are gonna let us. They're gonna let us,
is what l'm saying, when they see this.

805
01:08:35,886 --> 01:08:39,378
-Amazing.
-Came out all right, no thanks to you.

806
01:08:39,555 --> 01:08:41,523
Feel the seats, Alvin.

807
01:08:44,926 --> 01:08:46,917
All right. Got the Phat Farm hookup...

808
01:08:47,928 --> 01:08:51,830
...shag carpet, laptop, minibar. Wow.

809
01:08:52,532 --> 01:08:55,865
Wait till you see the routine
we got worked out to get in the car.

810
01:08:56,035 --> 01:08:58,526
Here. Stand in the front.
Come on, hurry up.

811
01:08:58,737 --> 01:09:00,568
Look, right there.

812
01:09:25,957 --> 01:09:27,549
Doors.

813
01:09:42,002 --> 01:09:45,494
You know, you guys should really
clean out the carburetor.

814
01:09:46,039 --> 01:09:50,032
Ben's got an old Holley four-barrel
at the shop. l think he'll let me get it.

815
01:09:50,876 --> 01:09:53,743
-Cool.
-We're cruising tonight.

816
01:09:55,013 --> 01:09:58,608
l can get right on it. l'll go down there
right now, have it fixed.

817
01:09:59,483 --> 01:10:03,044
-l really wanna roll out with you guys.
-For real? Right on.

818
01:10:03,519 --> 01:10:04,679
We missed you, man.

819
01:10:04,853 --> 01:10:08,619
We've been checking the GM website,
hoping to see your update.

820
01:10:09,857 --> 01:10:11,950
Hey, there's plenty of time for that.

821
01:10:12,326 --> 01:10:16,888
l'll meet you all at Kenneth's house at 8.
We gonna party. Go put on your good stuff.

822
01:10:17,830 --> 01:10:20,560
-l don't have any good stuff.
-lt's all right.

823
01:10:28,572 --> 01:10:31,632
Hey, yo, man. l'm digging the whip, boy.

824
01:10:34,008 --> 01:10:36,340
l'm feeling it, man.

825
01:10:36,477 --> 01:10:38,069
You got the hooptie.

826
01:10:39,746 --> 01:10:41,737
Look at her.

827
01:10:42,815 --> 01:10:47,411
Yeah, l'm like the Renaissance man
of automobiles. You feel me?

828
01:10:47,619 --> 01:10:53,421
This here is my newest work of art.
l call this the "groupie hooptie."

829
01:10:55,958 --> 01:10:57,482
This is hot.

830
01:10:58,961 --> 01:11:01,759
Put a microwave
in the glove compartment.

831
01:11:04,866 --> 01:11:07,562
Oh, no. Oh, no.

832
01:11:09,369 --> 01:11:13,362
-He's doing it.
-Get some. Quench your thirst on that.

833
01:11:17,709 --> 01:11:19,939
He's 63 and a half minutes late.
lt's not like him.

834
01:11:54,969 --> 01:11:56,596
Where you going in such a hurry?

835
01:11:59,673 --> 01:12:02,665
-No rush.
-l get free long distance on my cell, baby.

836
01:12:02,875 --> 01:12:04,365
l don't need it on a date.

837
01:12:08,747 --> 01:12:10,840
ls your foot on the gas?

838
01:12:14,018 --> 01:12:14,985
Sorry.

839
01:12:15,152 --> 01:12:16,779
Now...

840
01:12:19,154 --> 01:12:20,553
...where were we?

841
01:12:21,756 --> 01:12:23,121
You gotta relax, Al.

842
01:12:23,591 --> 01:12:25,491
lt's all right.

843
01:12:25,693 --> 01:12:29,789
Now, don't you worry, because
Mama's gonna take good care of you.

844
01:12:56,650 --> 01:12:58,675
-l was just e-mailing you.
-Sure you were.

845
01:12:58,885 --> 01:13:03,515
No, seriously, man, l'm telling you, you will
not believe what happened to me tonight.

846
01:13:03,722 --> 01:13:05,417
Give us the keys to our car.

847
01:13:06,690 --> 01:13:10,182
Okay, but l'm telling you,
it's coming out like a Penthouse letter.

848
01:13:14,463 --> 01:13:17,864
Y'all know how it is when you're
butt-naked with a little cutie, right?

849
01:13:18,900 --> 01:13:20,868
Yeah, right--

850
01:13:21,102 --> 01:13:24,833
We were worried. We thought you might
be at Ben's working on our car.

851
01:13:25,004 --> 01:13:28,906
-We went down there, but it was closed.
-Took an hour to get his home number.

852
01:13:29,709 --> 01:13:31,199
-You talked to Ben?
-Yeah.

853
01:13:31,576 --> 01:13:35,910
He says if you don't come in soon,
the camshaft's going back to Germany.

854
01:13:36,146 --> 01:13:40,105
-Oh.
-That's right, "Oh."

855
01:13:42,485 --> 01:13:44,112
Look. Let me explain this--

856
01:13:44,486 --> 01:13:48,081
As of midnight, we're officially
excommunicating Alvin from the clubhouse.

857
01:13:48,488 --> 01:13:51,548
The clubhouse from fourth-freaking-grade?
You can't be serious.

858
01:13:51,725 --> 01:13:54,626
We shall never again speak to,
nor respond to any words...

859
01:13:54,793 --> 01:13:58,229
-...from the aforementioned Alvin Johnson.
-Chuck, man.

860
01:13:58,596 --> 01:14:01,690
Three, two, one.

861
01:14:01,866 --> 01:14:04,130
Walter.

862
01:14:07,503 --> 01:14:08,731
Fine, then.

863
01:14:08,937 --> 01:14:11,770
Dude, l don't need you losers.

864
01:14:13,675 --> 01:14:15,700
Ain't my fault
you guys ain't getting no--

865
01:14:15,909 --> 01:14:18,571
Boobie? All you gave him
was a little boob action?

866
01:14:18,779 --> 01:14:19,905
That was all he wanted.

867
01:14:20,613 --> 01:14:23,241
-Was it good?
-l was good.

868
01:14:24,149 --> 01:14:28,210
Hello. What happened to the pact that we
wouldn't date each other's ex-boyfriends?

869
01:14:28,619 --> 01:14:33,147
This ain't Burger King.
You can't always have it your way.

870
01:14:33,823 --> 01:14:35,916
Come on, Zoe.

871
01:14:38,193 --> 01:14:40,161
Something is rotten in the hood.

872
01:14:40,528 --> 01:14:43,691
At first, l was gonna plan
a sort of blackmail angle on him.

873
01:14:43,864 --> 01:14:45,889
Then, after a great deal of research...

874
01:14:46,066 --> 01:14:48,694
...l realized he has nothing of value.

875
01:14:48,768 --> 01:14:53,171
So, here l am. l'm telling you.
He paid that girl to be his friend.

876
01:14:53,538 --> 01:14:56,268
Aretha, now, your brother
would never do such a thing.

877
01:14:58,042 --> 01:15:00,067
Pops, Moms, what's the deal?

878
01:15:00,276 --> 01:15:04,610
Hey, yo, no time for the victuals,
l gotta do my thug thizzle.

879
01:15:05,847 --> 01:15:07,872
Gotta have the pimp juice.

880
01:15:08,049 --> 01:15:09,641
l'll holler.

881
01:15:09,717 --> 01:15:14,780
Al, is there something that you want
to tell us about your engine part, son?

882
01:15:14,954 --> 01:15:20,051
That engine part
that is so very important to your future.

883
01:15:20,191 --> 01:15:24,719
You know what? That's a long story.
l'll put you up on game later on tonight.

884
01:15:24,895 --> 01:15:26,556
Let's make a long story short.

885
01:15:26,697 --> 01:15:31,828
Did you or did you not squander
your future on some tramp girl?

886
01:15:32,702 --> 01:15:35,136
Moms...

887
01:15:36,170 --> 01:15:37,967
...nobody uses the word
"tramp" anymore.

888
01:15:38,172 --> 01:15:42,871
You know, it's more like
"chickenhead" or "hootchie."

889
01:15:43,775 --> 01:15:45,902
Plus, it's my future.

890
01:15:47,179 --> 01:15:48,771
And that's my ride to school.

891
01:15:48,946 --> 01:15:53,246
School? Liar. Today is Senior Ditch Day.

892
01:15:54,184 --> 01:15:56,812
You know what?
Little biscuithead is right.

893
01:15:57,886 --> 01:16:01,083
l'm gonna go to the beach,
check out some breezies...

894
01:16:01,256 --> 01:16:04,020
...put my feet in the water
and kick it with my crew.

895
01:16:04,224 --> 01:16:09,287
And l could have lied to y'all,
not even told y'all, but y'all my folks.

896
01:16:09,930 --> 01:16:13,229
And l ain't got nothing but love for you.
Let me get that.

897
01:16:16,601 --> 01:16:20,560
-Peace out.
-l told you so. l told you so. l told you so.

898
01:16:20,738 --> 01:16:25,004
The money he had for the engine,
that's what he used to pay that girl.

899
01:16:25,941 --> 01:16:30,310
Well, then that's gonna have to end
right now.

900
01:16:31,245 --> 01:16:33,076
Go on, get your purse.

901
01:16:35,382 --> 01:16:37,782
Yo, what's up, Al?

902
01:16:37,850 --> 01:16:40,011
Hi, Alvin.

903
01:16:50,894 --> 01:16:52,759
Wait.

904
01:16:52,928 --> 01:16:55,123
Let me do that for you.

905
01:17:01,301 --> 01:17:03,098
Good looking out.

906
01:17:03,269 --> 01:17:06,761
Why are these B's following us?

907
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:10,334
Us? Why? We ain't on no date right now.

908
01:17:12,042 --> 01:17:15,205
Don't be mad.
l can't bring sand to the beach.

909
01:17:15,413 --> 01:17:18,746
Damn, man.
These shorties is really sweating you.

910
01:17:18,948 --> 01:17:21,212
Like gym socks.

911
01:17:25,253 --> 01:17:27,847
-Man, you doing it, baby.
-Yo, pimp, pimp, hooray.

912
01:17:27,921 --> 01:17:29,889
l ain't mad at you.

913
01:17:30,090 --> 01:17:33,617
Hey, Kadeem. l need to rap with Al.

914
01:17:42,866 --> 01:17:45,198
Handle that.

915
01:17:47,103 --> 01:17:49,196
So, what's up, shorty?

916
01:17:49,371 --> 01:17:51,271
Shorty, huh?

917
01:17:53,041 --> 01:17:56,169
Look, l was thinking maybe
we should still hang out sometime.

918
01:17:56,342 --> 01:17:58,333
As friends.

919
01:17:59,279 --> 01:18:00,303
You're a great listener.

920
01:18:04,449 --> 01:18:08,886
So l guess your boy Anthony's neck didn't
taste as good as you made it look?

921
01:18:09,420 --> 01:18:10,910
Please. He's old and tired.

922
01:18:11,121 --> 01:18:14,352
Yeah. And now since l'm the coolest
thing since shoestrings...

923
01:18:15,291 --> 01:18:16,258
...you trying to get laced, right?

924
01:18:16,458 --> 01:18:17,755
Al.

925
01:18:17,959 --> 01:18:21,395
lf l'd known you was for sale,
l would've bought you sooner.

926
01:18:23,697 --> 01:18:25,961
Now, you need to slow your roll.

927
01:18:26,032 --> 01:18:29,195
How dare you stand in my face
popping that noise? Are you crazy?

928
01:18:29,836 --> 01:18:33,135
Look, l made you "Al."

929
01:18:33,939 --> 01:18:38,774
l will work overtime to break you, Alvin.
You got that?

930
01:18:41,477 --> 01:18:43,445
You can't break a real man, baby.

931
01:18:46,013 --> 01:18:47,310
l'm waiting for you.

932
01:18:50,184 --> 01:18:53,847
You gonna have to excuse me.
l'm all booked up.

933
01:18:53,919 --> 01:18:56,080
-Auditioning prom dates.
-Yeah.

934
01:18:56,388 --> 01:18:59,983
Now, there's a real catch.
She's given more rides than Greyhound.

935
01:19:00,258 --> 01:19:04,160
Yeah, but l bet you it won't cost me
$ 1500 for a ticket.

936
01:19:09,232 --> 01:19:12,292
Yeah. You don't have nothing
to say now, do you?

937
01:19:14,269 --> 01:19:15,429
Whatever.

938
01:19:16,070 --> 01:19:17,435
You don't need her no more, boo.

939
01:19:18,372 --> 01:19:21,102
-Yeah. That's what l'm talking about.
-Come on, let's dance.

940
01:19:21,474 --> 01:19:23,237
Dance?

941
01:21:18,429 --> 01:21:19,987
Do you really care about me?

942
01:21:20,064 --> 01:21:21,895
Of course l do, girl.

943
01:21:22,065 --> 01:21:24,033
Well, prove it.

944
01:21:26,468 --> 01:21:29,232
l always used to watch you. Yeah.

945
01:21:29,403 --> 01:21:31,200
And you....

946
01:21:31,839 --> 01:21:34,831
You inspired me...

947
01:21:34,975 --> 01:21:36,567
-...to write you a song.
-Really?

948
01:21:37,476 --> 01:21:39,273
Yeah. Yeah. lt goes like this.

949
01:21:39,578 --> 01:21:44,447
Olivia, me and you
We will rise

950
01:21:46,016 --> 01:21:48,177
Despite our fears inside

951
01:21:48,552 --> 01:21:51,077
Rumor has it today's Senior Ditch Day.

952
01:21:54,122 --> 01:21:55,282
Dru Hilton.

953
01:21:56,457 --> 01:21:58,152
What's the deal, baby?
What brings you out here?

954
01:21:58,325 --> 01:22:01,055
Came to see Paris, man.
Where she at? Where she at?

955
01:22:01,228 --> 01:22:02,559
Yo. Thirty points last game?

956
01:22:03,196 --> 01:22:06,324
l'm balling, baby. What you know?
What you know?

957
01:22:06,565 --> 01:22:10,194
What's up? What's going on, dog,
you know what l'm saying?

958
01:22:12,036 --> 01:22:13,435
Dru.

959
01:22:15,138 --> 01:22:18,164
lt's been a while.
l wasn't expecting you in town so soon.

960
01:22:18,340 --> 01:22:22,208
You know, team got in a day early,
so l thought l'd surprise you.

961
01:22:23,545 --> 01:22:29,347
What do you say you and l
get out of here, just the two of us?

962
01:22:31,884 --> 01:22:34,045
You give me a chance to apologize.

963
01:22:34,286 --> 01:22:35,514
All right.

964
01:22:35,887 --> 01:22:37,354
Let me get my things.

965
01:22:41,458 --> 01:22:44,052
Damn, brother. lt's that easy, huh?

966
01:22:44,127 --> 01:22:47,961
Hey, hey, hey. Look, what goes
on the road, stays on the road.

967
01:22:53,534 --> 01:22:58,870
Besides, this girl, she's my first love. She
can't even picture being with anybody else.

968
01:22:59,439 --> 01:23:02,499
Yo, one of you fools
been trying to get with Paris?

969
01:23:03,174 --> 01:23:07,270
-Which one of you? Which one of you?
-Yo, chill, Dru, all right? lt wasn't me.

970
01:23:07,445 --> 01:23:09,538
She was Al Johnson's girl. Not mine.

971
01:23:09,912 --> 01:23:12,540
-Who?
-Al Johnson, man.

972
01:23:13,549 --> 01:23:16,518
See, the only Al Johnson l know
is Alvin Johnson.

973
01:23:17,519 --> 01:23:19,487
Yeah, he getting shorties now.

974
01:23:19,688 --> 01:23:21,485
Aquaman.

975
01:23:21,689 --> 01:23:23,213
All right.

976
01:23:25,325 --> 01:23:27,350
What's wrong?

977
01:23:27,427 --> 01:23:29,224
Why you looking at me like that?

978
01:23:30,562 --> 01:23:31,654
l hear you got yourself a new man.

979
01:23:34,532 --> 01:23:36,625
-Really, it's not--
-Whatever. Whatever.

980
01:23:37,568 --> 01:23:40,230
l didn't come back here
for you to lie in my face.

981
01:23:40,402 --> 01:23:41,664
We're done.

982
01:23:42,571 --> 01:23:44,562
-No. No, look. Wait.
-Get off me. Get off me!

983
01:23:44,939 --> 01:23:49,103
l swear. Look, l haven't moved on, Dru!

984
01:23:58,383 --> 01:24:01,443
-Alvin!
-Yo, Paris, where you going?

985
01:24:02,386 --> 01:24:07,187
Al, get out there. l need you
to go tell Dru about our deal.

986
01:24:07,390 --> 01:24:09,483
l'm kind of in the middle of something--

987
01:24:09,658 --> 01:24:14,152
Alvin, Dru is about to leave.
Please, just go tell him the truth.

988
01:24:14,362 --> 01:24:17,957
The truth is that we were dating,
l got over you, and that was that.

989
01:24:18,098 --> 01:24:20,259
-Al! Dru is--
-Paris, stop it.

990
01:24:20,433 --> 01:24:22,663
You're making a fool of yourself.

991
01:24:30,174 --> 01:24:32,233
Oh, so you won't tell Dru the truth...

992
01:24:32,442 --> 01:24:38,472
...because you're afraid that they'll find out
that you paid me to be your friend?

993
01:24:39,080 --> 01:24:43,141
Well, guess what. They just found out.

994
01:24:44,218 --> 01:24:46,948
He just wanted to be popular.

995
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:51,420
So he spent 1500 bucks on me
to hang out with him for two weeks.

996
01:24:53,125 --> 01:24:55,320
That's the truth.

997
01:24:58,229 --> 01:25:01,562
Well, technically,
the money was spent on the car.

998
01:25:01,765 --> 01:25:04,233
Olivia. What about our song?

999
01:25:04,433 --> 01:25:07,163
We will rise
Despite those who burning us

1000
01:25:07,335 --> 01:25:10,395
-She burning us with the lie--
-Shut up.

1001
01:25:11,138 --> 01:25:12,537
Didn't have to push me.

1002
01:25:12,739 --> 01:25:17,108
That's my song! l wrote those words.

1003
01:25:26,115 --> 01:25:28,174
Yeah, what's that old saying?

1004
01:25:28,251 --> 01:25:32,085
"Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned"?
Can l get an amen?

1005
01:25:32,721 --> 01:25:35,155
A hallelujah?

1006
01:25:36,657 --> 01:25:38,750
l was just trying to quote,
you know, an old philosopher.

1007
01:25:39,126 --> 01:25:43,756
l think it was Pimping Ken
or Aristotle or Chris Rock.

1008
01:25:44,130 --> 01:25:47,327
Serves him right.
Let's go. Come on, let's go.

1009
01:25:47,498 --> 01:25:49,466
Hey, y'all, wait up. Anthony. Ted.

1010
01:25:52,270 --> 01:25:55,000
Ted. Anthony.

1011
01:26:17,388 --> 01:26:19,754
Maybe l should just try
and look past all of this.

1012
01:26:20,657 --> 01:26:23,182
Girl, you know Dru loves you.
He'll take you back.

1013
01:26:23,358 --> 01:26:25,383
No, l mean....

1014
01:26:27,829 --> 01:26:30,525
You know what l've been thinking, Zoe?

1015
01:26:33,567 --> 01:26:39,130
After graduation, l was thinking
of moving to San Francisco.

1016
01:26:39,704 --> 01:26:45,609
You know, take singing lessons. l mean,
l've been learning how to play guitar, girl.

1017
01:26:46,677 --> 01:26:47,666
Oh, get real, girl.

1018
01:26:47,844 --> 01:26:51,507
You're never gonna be
Alicia Keys or Norah Jones.

1019
01:26:51,714 --> 01:26:55,206
You're gonna be the wife of an NBA star.

1020
01:26:55,283 --> 01:26:58,150
Life doesn't get any better than that.

1021
01:26:58,653 --> 01:27:02,350
Hello? Paris?

1022
01:27:02,822 --> 01:27:04,517
Paris?

1023
01:27:44,621 --> 01:27:46,521
l need to talk to you, son.

1024
01:27:52,293 --> 01:27:54,818
Dad, l got all the condoms l could use.

1025
01:27:55,528 --> 01:27:57,860
Probably won't be needing any
in the near future.

1026
01:27:58,731 --> 01:28:00,198
Well, look. Why don't you get up, son...

1027
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:03,392
...because your future is what l'm here
to talk to you about.

1028
01:28:07,538 --> 01:28:11,304
That's right. l got your camshaft.

1029
01:28:11,374 --> 01:28:15,640
Now, you probably gonna have
to work like hell to pay this thing off...

1030
01:28:15,811 --> 01:28:19,611
...but l don't want you to worry about that
till you finish that engine up.

1031
01:28:20,147 --> 01:28:22,342
lt's probably too late.

1032
01:28:22,516 --> 01:28:26,452
And l have to rebuild the engine
to the new camshaft...

1033
01:28:26,619 --> 01:28:28,849
...then retest it.

1034
01:28:29,421 --> 01:28:31,321
lt's a lot of work.

1035
01:28:31,489 --> 01:28:36,324
Okay, then get off your ass
and handle your business.

1036
01:28:38,627 --> 01:28:41,323
Look, Alvin. Look, man.

1037
01:28:41,497 --> 01:28:46,594
When l was in school, l was one
of the coolest dudes at the school.

1038
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:51,430
l was something else, man.
l had the whole game working.

1039
01:28:52,606 --> 01:28:55,166
And l guess l kind
of just always wanted you...

1040
01:28:55,308 --> 01:28:59,369
...to have that same kind
of fun that l did.

1041
01:29:04,547 --> 01:29:06,879
But you know why that was?

1042
01:29:07,517 --> 01:29:09,712
See, it was because, see...

1043
01:29:10,652 --> 01:29:12,643
...l didn't have your brains.

1044
01:29:14,789 --> 01:29:16,780
l didn't have your potential.

1045
01:29:17,424 --> 01:29:19,255
None of that, man.

1046
01:29:20,527 --> 01:29:21,687
But you....

1047
01:29:21,860 --> 01:29:24,761
From day one, me and your mama...

1048
01:29:24,963 --> 01:29:29,525
...we always knew, man, that you was just
gonna achieve some great things for us.

1049
01:29:31,468 --> 01:29:34,301
l don't know, l guess maybe l was...

1050
01:29:34,470 --> 01:29:37,837
...maybe a little jealous or something.
l don't know.

1051
01:29:38,206 --> 01:29:40,436
But l'm gonna tell you something, though.

1052
01:29:44,712 --> 01:29:47,545
l have always...

1053
01:29:47,714 --> 01:29:50,808
...always been proud of you, son.

1054
01:29:58,688 --> 01:30:01,589
l been damn proud of you, man.

1055
01:30:54,263 --> 01:30:56,458
Look who's awake.

1056
01:30:56,599 --> 01:30:58,499
You finished it.

1057
01:30:59,035 --> 01:31:01,401
Congratulations, it looks good.

1058
01:31:02,871 --> 01:31:04,930
Yeah, thanks. Hey, guys, look--

1059
01:31:05,773 --> 01:31:06,569
Man, save your breath.

1060
01:31:08,041 --> 01:31:10,635
Look, come on, guys. Don't go. l was--

1061
01:31:10,843 --> 01:31:14,643
-What's the matter with the Galaxie?
-lt's none of your concern.

1062
01:31:48,605 --> 01:31:52,666
The scholarship committee's probably gonna
want to look at this engine next week.

1063
01:31:52,841 --> 01:31:56,902
Other than that, y'all needed an engine.

1064
01:32:11,789 --> 01:32:14,587
Set the screen! Set the screen!

1065
01:32:16,326 --> 01:32:18,590
There it is. There it is.

1066
01:32:19,895 --> 01:32:22,796
Thirty seconds remaining in the half.

1067
01:32:28,502 --> 01:32:31,027
Get back, get back.
Come on, Ted. Come on, Ted.

1068
01:32:36,675 --> 01:32:39,838
-Basket by number 32.
-Hey, that was your man.

1069
01:32:40,010 --> 01:32:41,841
You got to call a switch.

1070
01:32:43,646 --> 01:32:45,978
See, this is the reason why we're losing.

1071
01:32:46,349 --> 01:32:47,907
Because we're infected with losers.

1072
01:32:48,117 --> 01:32:50,608
Stay focused on the game, man.
Forget them.

1073
01:32:50,819 --> 01:32:52,047
Oh, man.

1074
01:32:52,553 --> 01:32:57,047
Attention, losers,
get out of my good-luck seats now!

1075
01:32:57,857 --> 01:32:59,654
No, we're gonna sit where we want.

1076
01:32:59,825 --> 01:33:01,816
Oh, you think it's a game, huh?

1077
01:33:02,460 --> 01:33:04,428
Get up or get beat down.

1078
01:33:04,629 --> 01:33:08,565
Yo, Ted, let's go, man. Let's go
to the locker room. We're running plays.

1079
01:33:08,732 --> 01:33:09,994
Move now.

1080
01:33:13,002 --> 01:33:15,061
You wanna beat somebody up,
huh, tough guy?

1081
01:33:15,470 --> 01:33:17,700
He just asked for an ass-whupping.

1082
01:33:17,771 --> 01:33:19,466
l've been waiting for this.

1083
01:33:19,640 --> 01:33:21,972
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Ted.

1084
01:33:22,143 --> 01:33:24,611
l'll beat you like you stole something.

1085
01:33:24,777 --> 01:33:26,677
Go ahead.

1086
01:33:26,845 --> 01:33:28,904
Start beating.

1087
01:33:29,114 --> 01:33:31,947
Can't beat me no worse
than l been beating myself...

1088
01:33:32,151 --> 01:33:34,551
...for wanting to be friends with you.

1089
01:33:35,519 --> 01:33:37,749
All this time,
l was just fronting to be cool.

1090
01:33:39,389 --> 01:33:42,620
Because l didn't have the balls enough
to be myself.

1091
01:33:43,859 --> 01:33:46,623
So instead,
l started dissing my real friends.

1092
01:33:46,827 --> 01:33:49,819
But, hey, this is who l am.

1093
01:33:49,897 --> 01:33:52,923
Alvin Johnson. Pool boy.

1094
01:33:57,669 --> 01:34:01,605
l like blended mocha lattes,
with a little foam on the top.

1095
01:34:03,774 --> 01:34:05,674
l like Michael Jackson's Bad album.

1096
01:34:10,078 --> 01:34:11,807
This is me.

1097
01:34:12,014 --> 01:34:14,949
And l ain't afraid to admit it.

1098
01:34:16,750 --> 01:34:18,615
So go ahead, Ted.

1099
01:34:19,018 --> 01:34:20,576
Do it.

1100
01:34:21,154 --> 01:34:22,917
Hit me.

1101
01:34:23,555 --> 01:34:25,113
And l'm gonna show you who's bad.

1102
01:34:26,157 --> 01:34:27,988
-Ted, what you gonna do?
-Yeah, Ted.

1103
01:34:28,927 --> 01:34:30,588
Who's bad?

1104
01:34:30,761 --> 01:34:32,752
You are a freak!

1105
01:34:35,864 --> 01:34:37,957
Yeah.

1106
01:34:39,034 --> 01:34:40,058
-Take your boy.
-Chill, we got him.

1107
01:34:40,434 --> 01:34:42,800
Yeah, you chill. You chill.

1108
01:35:44,149 --> 01:35:45,741
All right.

1109
01:35:48,586 --> 01:35:49,416
Alvin.

1110
01:35:50,188 --> 01:35:52,656
Alvin, stop.

1111
01:35:52,723 --> 01:35:55,749
Hey. Hey, baby.

1112
01:35:56,025 --> 01:36:00,189
l've been thinking. l'm gonna give you
one more chance to apologize.

1113
01:36:02,596 --> 01:36:04,063
l have other dreams.

1114
01:36:04,765 --> 01:36:08,064
Other dreams? l'm your meal ticket.

1115
01:36:08,268 --> 01:36:09,895
Pool boy, right? You bugging.

1116
01:36:10,103 --> 01:36:11,968
Alvin, stop.

1117
01:36:12,638 --> 01:36:15,004
-Alvin, l know. l know what you're thinking.
-No.

1118
01:36:15,172 --> 01:36:18,107
-You think you know.
-No. l know.

1119
01:36:18,842 --> 01:36:21,970
You're all mad at yourself
and feeling like some kind of fool...

1120
01:36:22,145 --> 01:36:26,479
...because you've been fronting
about who you are for two weeks?

1121
01:36:26,648 --> 01:36:28,980
l been fronting about who l am,
who l wanna be...

1122
01:36:29,150 --> 01:36:31,584
...for as long as l can even remember.

1123
01:36:31,753 --> 01:36:33,983
And on the real, l'm tired--
