# So worth the yearnlng for

# So swell to keep

# So carefree together

00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:52,244
There's great wisdom in jokes, Falk, really.

15
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:55,748
There's an old joke
about a prizefighter in the ring.

16
00:01:55,815 --> 00:01:58,579
He's getting his brains beat out.

17
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:03,020
And his mother's in the audience,
and she's watching him getting beaten up.

18
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:08,391
There's a priest next to her
and she says, "Father, pray for him."

19
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:13,057
And the priest says, "I will,
but if he could punch, it would help."

20
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:16,125
There's more insight in thatjoke,

21
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:20,400
into what I call the Giant So What

22
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:23,271
than most books on philosophy.

23
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:25,607
Women.

24
00:02:25,678 --> 00:02:31,514
Camus said that women are all
that we're ever going to know

25
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:34,109
of paradise on earth.

26
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:37,748
In your case, Falk,
there is a seminal joke

27
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:42,158
that Henny Youngman used to tell
that I think is perfect.

28
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:45,459
It sums it up perfectly
as far as you go.

29
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:47,227
Guy comes into a doctor's office.

30
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,827
He says, "Doc, it hurts when I do this."

31
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:54,237
The doctor says, "Don't do it."

32
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:56,502
Think about that.

33
00:02:57,577 --> 00:03:00,546
That's Davld Dobel,
and I'm Jerry Falk.

34
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:03,776
We spent many afternoons walklng
and talklng In the park.

35
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,512
Dld I know when I flrst met hlm
how nuts he was?

36
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:12,047
We met at the office of some so-called
intellectual comedian's agent.

37
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:15,617
We were comedy writers trying
to break into the business

38
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,822
by writing nightclub routines for comics.

39
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:22,061
The difference was,
I was 21 and he was 60.

40
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:26,299
He wants truisms.
Notjustjokes. Truisms.

41
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:30,069
We can't afford the crazy prices
for the more established...

42
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:32,611
Let me say this, if I may.

43
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:37,309
I can't speak for David Dobel
because I don't handle him.

44
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:39,851
In fact, Jerry and I just met him now.

45
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:44,879
But I've handled Jerry Falk
since he began, and with Jerry Falk,

46
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,756
you get top-quality goods for your money.

47
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:50,955
You can buy a suit and get
the same cut in a cheap fabric

48
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:56,093
as you can in an expensive fabric.
Jerry gives you affordable fabric,

49
00:03:56,169 --> 00:04:01,106
a quality fabric, at affordable prices.
Is this gabardine?

50
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:04,166
Who is that piece goods salesman
who handles you?

51
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:07,304
Harvey? Don't ask.
My cross to bear.

52
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:10,816
I'd love to dump him,
but I'm his only client.

53
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:13,351
You pay that troll
ten percent of your salary?

54
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:16,650
20. Actually, 25.
It's a long story.

55
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:19,954
He was there for me
when my marriage broke up.

56
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:23,257
Your... don't tell me
you got married young.

57
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:26,526
You thought it would be exciting.
It turned out to be hebetudinous

58
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:29,090
and you dumped her.
Am I right?

59
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:32,501
You are not. She left me.
I can't leave anybody.

60
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:36,736
It's my main problem in analysis.
I'm afraid to sleep alone. "Hebetudinous?"

61
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:40,074
- You're in analysis already?
- Yes. Very committed, actually.

62
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:42,740
I turned down some TV jobs
in Los Angeles

63
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:45,477
because my shrink felt
we weren't finished yet.

64
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:48,349
You chose psychoanalysis over real life?

65
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:50,616
Are you learning disabled?

66
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:53,682
[Falk:] Obviously, you're not familiar
with analysis.

67
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,957
Wrong. I'm completely familiar with it.

68
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:00,522
Similar hustlers tried to fob it
off on me at Payne Whitney.

69
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,036
- You were in Payne Whitney?
- That's right. A nuthouse.

70
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:06,731
I was in the psycho ward
for six months,

71
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:09,673
a vacation I don't look back on
with great nostalgia.

72
00:05:09,742 --> 00:05:11,676
Really?

73
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:14,076
Relax.
You don't have to move away.

74
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:17,605
Oh, no. I'm not suggesting
you were violent.

75
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:21,620
But I was violent.
That's why they put you in a straitjacket.

76
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:23,918
You were in a straitjacket?

77
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,084
I'm not going to take an ax
and split your head open.

78
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,061
- Don't be scared.
- I'm just surprised.

79
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:31,994
What happened?
Why were you there?

80
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:33,623
I broke up with this girl,

81
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:37,864
and they put me
with a psychiatrist who said,

82
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:42,340
"Why did you get so depressed,

83
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:46,606
"and do all those things you did?"
I said, "I wanted this girl and she left me."

84
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:49,648
And he said,
"Well, we have to look into that."

85
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:53,208
And I said, "There's nothing to look into!
I wanted her and she left me."

86
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:57,848
And he said, "Well, why are you feeling
so intense?"

87
00:05:57,924 --> 00:06:01,416
And I said, "Cause I want the girl!"
And he said, "What's underneath it?"

88
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:03,928
And I said, "Nothing!"

89
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:06,157
He said, "I'll have to
give you medication."

90
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:08,792
I said, "I don't want medication!
I want the girl!"

91
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,632
And he said,
"We have to work this through."

92
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:15,640
So, I took a fire extinguisher
from the casement

93
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,336
and struck him across
the back of his neck.

94
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:21,005
And before I knew it,
guys from Con Ed

95
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:25,881
had jumper cables in my head
and the rest was...

96
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:27,943
Why are you in analysis?

97
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,784
You're afraid to sleep alone.
What else?

98
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:32,825
Fear of death.

99
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:35,725
That's funny. I have that, too!
My dog has it.

100
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:37,922
It's very common to living creatures.

101
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:40,795
And I have rough patches
with my girlfriend.

102
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:42,994
- You have a girlfriend?
- I am deeply in love.

103
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:43,831
Really?

104
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:49,273
Yes, with the most beautiful,
charming, sexy...

105
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:52,243
- But there are rough patches.
- We'll get through them.

106
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:55,678
But there are painful conflicts.

107
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:59,081
She can be difficult.
But you'd love her. She's a knockout.

108
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:02,451
- A knockout, but impossible.
- I never said impossible.

109
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:05,082
- You did!
- Difficult. She can be difficult.

110
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:08,889
Now she's difficult.
Soon, she'll be impossible.

111
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:13,193
She's very supportive of my goals.
What are these goals?

112
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,961
I want to write a novel.

113
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:18,094
A novel about man's fate
in the empty universe.

114
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:22,801
No god, no hope, just human suffering
and loneliness.

115
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:26,208
Stick to jokes, that's where the money is.
Want a lift?

116
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:29,146
No, I'm okay.
I'm meeting my girlfriend.

117
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:31,410
Today is our anniversary.

118
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:35,443
You know, maybe next week,
if you'd like,

119
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:38,854
we could drive out to watch
that intellectual comedian

120
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:43,487
parade his amphigories for us.

121
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:45,690
Sure. That'd be great.

122
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:50,759
It's funny. I was once in a cab...
this was years ago.

123
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:53,567
And I was pouring my heart out
to the driver

124
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:56,802
about all the stuff
you were prattling on about...

125
00:07:56,876 --> 00:08:00,175
life, death, the empty universe,

126
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:03,010
the meaning of existence,
human suffering.

127
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:06,074
And the cab driver said to me:

128
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:09,485
"You know, it's like anything else."

129
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:11,182
Think about that.

130
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:16,384
He was a teacher who lived on
Roosevelt Island. Public school.

131
00:08:16,462 --> 00:08:20,262
Too frightened to quit
and write comedy full-time because,

132
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,996
as he said,
he knew what it was to starve.

133
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:27,005
"Amphigories"?
"Hebetudinous"?

134
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:30,042
Meanwhile, I'm on my way
to meet Amanda.

135
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:32,805
I'll be on time, she'll be late.

136
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:35,712
She's late, she's disorganized.

137
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:37,942
Incidentally, that's not our big problem.

138
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:41,384
She drives me crazy,
but wait till you meet her.

139
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:43,752
She is adorable!

140
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:04,709
- Jerry!
- Amanda! Hey!

141
00:09:04,776 --> 00:09:08,405
- Am I late?
- Not if we go by Rocky Mountain time.

142
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,313
Can you pay for the cab?
I forgot my wallet.

143
00:09:11,383 --> 00:09:14,546
Pay for the cab?
Are you getting the picture?

144
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:19,114
You know, we did say 7:30.

145
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:21,056
Sorry!

146
00:09:22,694 --> 00:09:25,788
It was pretty tough to get a reservation.

147
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:29,601
- What's the matter?
- I'm in a bad mood.

148
00:09:29,668 --> 00:09:33,900
- I can see. Why?
- I did terribly at an audition today.

149
00:09:33,972 --> 00:09:36,463
You always think you did badly.

150
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:41,137
I felt so confident until I got up to read,
then I completely froze.

151
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:44,114
Don't obsess.
I'm sure it wasn't that bad.

152
00:09:44,182 --> 00:09:48,676
I'm my own worst enemy.
I could play that part in my sleep.

153
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:51,348
I know you can.
Just calm down.

154
00:09:51,423 --> 00:09:55,757
We'll go have a good dinner.
We'll have wine, you can relax.

155
00:09:55,827 --> 00:10:00,025
I got to tell you about this character I met.
He's fascinating.

156
00:10:00,098 --> 00:10:04,091
Don't be mad at me, but I ate.

157
00:10:06,004 --> 00:10:07,801
You ate?

158
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:11,809
I was starving when I got back
from the audition,

159
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:15,608
so I had a little sliver
of that Sara Lee cheesecake.

160
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:19,617
Then I had another one.
You know what I'm like when I get started.

161
00:10:19,685 --> 00:10:22,245
Pretty soon, I'd eaten the whole cake.

162
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:25,882
You ate the whole
Sara Lee cheesecake?

163
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:29,917
Then I figured, what the hell!
I finished the spaghetti in the refrigerator,

164
00:10:29,995 --> 00:10:34,125
ate that last lobster tail
and heated up a chicken pot pie.

165
00:10:34,199 --> 00:10:36,929
Is there any furniture
left in the house?

166
00:10:37,002 --> 00:10:40,335
I'm so fat, it's disgusting.

167
00:10:40,405 --> 00:10:42,464
How could you eat before dinner?

168
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:45,977
I'm sorry. I was so angry at myself
for screwing up.

169
00:10:46,044 --> 00:10:48,444
I couldn't help it.

170
00:10:48,513 --> 00:10:50,811
I reserved a corner booth.

171
00:10:50,882 --> 00:10:56,184
It's okay. You can order and I'll get
a club soda. I'm dieting anyway.

172
00:10:56,254 --> 00:10:59,849
I can't take their best booth
with just one of us eating.

173
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:01,449
It's not nice.

174
00:11:01,526 --> 00:11:03,824
- It's fine.
- No, it's not.

175
00:11:03,895 --> 00:11:07,331
It's dinner hour.
The restaurant's jam-packed.

176
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:09,765
How does it look?

177
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:13,566
Why do you always care
what other people think?

178
00:11:13,638 --> 00:11:16,937
It's embarrassing
ifjust one of us eats.

179
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:20,740
Okay. I'll order a meal
and I just won't eat it.

180
00:11:20,812 --> 00:11:22,780
I can't do that.

181
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:25,078
So order me a steak,
I'll get a doggie bag,

182
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:27,311
and it'll be my insomnia snack.

183
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:29,854
What kind of anniversary dinner is that?

184
00:11:29,921 --> 00:11:34,290
"Can I have one dinner, and can you
put a steak in a doggie bag?"

185
00:11:34,359 --> 00:11:37,556
I thought we'd sit over some wine

186
00:11:37,629 --> 00:11:41,725
and I'd look in your eyes and
tell you how beautiful you are.

187
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,291
I'm not beautiful. I'm fat.

188
00:11:44,369 --> 00:11:48,465
Okay, I'll cancel the reservation.

189
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:53,239
Let's go home. I'll make myself
some eggs or something.

190
00:11:53,311 --> 00:11:56,644
There are no more eggs.
I ate them.

191
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:58,808
[Amanda:] What are you doing?

192
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:03,412
I made myself a sandwich.
There were some cans of tuna left.

193
00:12:03,488 --> 00:12:06,821
Thank God she hasn't learned how to use
the new electric can opener yet.

194
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:09,053
My mother's moving in with us.

195
00:12:09,127 --> 00:12:12,290
- What?
- I'm so angry at her.

196
00:12:12,364 --> 00:12:14,730
Wait a minute.
Did I miss something?

197
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,064
She left her boyfriend.

198
00:12:17,135 --> 00:12:20,502
What happened?
I thought she was finally settled.

199
00:12:20,572 --> 00:12:23,405
What happened is she's Madame Bovary.

200
00:12:23,475 --> 00:12:28,139
She's married to a Park Avenue doctor
and that's too dull for her.

201
00:12:28,213 --> 00:12:30,613
Then there's Tom,
the money market maven,

202
00:12:30,682 --> 00:12:34,675
and Perry, the travel agent guy.
But, no, she wants more.

203
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:37,221
More? More what?

204
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:41,817
I'm sure she doesn't know.
More fantasies.

205
00:12:41,893 --> 00:12:44,657
Her youth back.

206
00:12:44,729 --> 00:12:48,187
She wants to "fulfill her life
before it's too late."

207
00:12:48,266 --> 00:12:51,724
- Those are her words.
- Why is she coming here?

208
00:12:51,803 --> 00:12:55,136
She has no money.
She has nowhere else to go.

209
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:58,643
Amanda, we have no room.
There's no room here.

210
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:01,406
I figured we'll put a bed in the office.

211
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:05,211
In the office, Amanda?
That's where I write.

212
00:13:05,283 --> 00:13:08,684
That's where I create.
My whole world is in there.

213
00:13:08,753 --> 00:13:10,778
You can create in the living room.

214
00:13:10,856 --> 00:13:15,259
In the...? No, Amanda.
Everything is in there, okay?

215
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:17,557
That's my space.
It's where I write.

216
00:13:17,629 --> 00:13:21,429
All of my rituals
revolve around my space.

217
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,559
- I can't...
- She's my mother.

218
00:13:23,635 --> 00:13:27,036
- She's not staying in a shelter.
- Why didn't you tell me earlier?

219
00:13:27,105 --> 00:13:31,906
- I didn't want to ruin your dinner.
- My anniversary tuna fish sandwich?

220
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:36,607
You're making matters worse, okay?
You're giving me a migraine.

221
00:13:36,681 --> 00:13:38,239
[Phone rings]
Hello.

222
00:13:38,316 --> 00:13:43,811
I'll only be a minute.
When I left you, I ran into Danny Wax.

223
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:49,156
He said the baby-sitter routine
you wrote for him is not working.

224
00:13:49,227 --> 00:13:52,492
There are no laughs.
Not one laugh in that routine.

225
00:13:52,564 --> 00:13:55,795
People are sitting with stone faces.

226
00:13:55,867 --> 00:14:00,031
The routine is fine.
The guy's just in the wrong profession.

227
00:14:00,105 --> 00:14:04,906
That's what I told him. I said, "Danny,
you've been around for a long time.

228
00:14:04,976 --> 00:14:07,342
"You think there's a reason
you never made it?"

229
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:11,312
No tact.
None. None.

230
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:16,047
I said to him, "Danny, a man buys a suit.

231
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:18,453
"He says he's happy with it.

232
00:14:18,523 --> 00:14:21,185
"Then he sees another suit.

233
00:14:21,259 --> 00:14:23,489
Suddenly he doesn't want
the suit he's got!

234
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:28,192
"He wants a new suit.
He's not happy with the old one."

235
00:14:28,266 --> 00:14:31,235
Right, yeah.
Listen, I'm a little busy now.

236
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:33,134
Can I ring you back?

237
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:37,301
I was up to NBC.
There is nothing doing up there.

238
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:40,071
Not right now.
Things being equal, they'll change.

239
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:44,514
Right now they're not equal.
I'd like to have lunch with you this week.

240
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:47,177
I need a business thing done.
We have to talk.

241
00:14:47,252 --> 00:14:49,413
I got a business thing to discuss.

242
00:14:49,487 --> 00:14:53,981
What kind of business?
What do you mean?

243
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:57,187
There's nothing to get anxious about.
It's about the future.

244
00:14:57,262 --> 00:14:59,526
Good-bye.

245
00:15:00,999 --> 00:15:04,059
Jerry, do you think I'm fat?

246
00:15:04,135 --> 00:15:06,660
I think you're amazing-looking.

247
00:15:06,738 --> 00:15:09,229
You're just used to the losers
you dated before me.

248
00:15:09,307 --> 00:15:12,401
Losers? Not all of them were losers.

249
00:15:12,477 --> 00:15:15,412
What is behind your back?
Something for me?

250
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,313
- This is for you. Happy anniversary.
- Happy anniversary.

251
00:15:18,383 --> 00:15:21,716
You have to forgive the wrapping.

252
00:15:21,786 --> 00:15:24,084
I lost my temper
when I couldn't get it even.

253
00:15:24,155 --> 00:15:27,784
I can tell. Not exactly a work of art,
but I forgive you.

254
00:15:27,859 --> 00:15:29,224
Open, open.

255
00:15:29,294 --> 00:15:32,889
- I think I know what these are.
- Do you?

256
00:15:32,964 --> 00:15:35,194
These are the earrings from downtown!

257
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,235
I couldn't not get them for you.

258
00:15:37,302 --> 00:15:40,738
You look so good
in those kind of earrings.

259
00:15:40,805 --> 00:15:42,705
Do I?

260
00:15:42,774 --> 00:15:44,833
Beautiful.
Absolutely beautiful.

261
00:15:44,909 --> 00:15:48,436
- Thank you.
- You like them?

262
00:15:48,513 --> 00:15:52,882
You're the only one I've ever dated
who's known exactly what to get me.

263
00:15:52,951 --> 00:15:56,887
It's because you have
a special vision of me.

264
00:15:56,955 --> 00:15:59,719
"No Exit" and "The Flies."
Jean Paul Sartre.

265
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:02,521
That's amazing. Thank you.

266
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:04,084
It was between that and O'Neill.

267
00:16:04,162 --> 00:16:07,359
I couldn't decide whose
nihilistic pessimism made you happier.

268
00:16:07,432 --> 00:16:10,162
I think it was Tennessee Williams

269
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:13,693
who said that the opposite of death
is desire.

270
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,976
[Falk:] And I desired you
from the first moment we met.

271
00:16:18,142 --> 00:16:21,634
I could live down here.
It's so beautiful.

272
00:16:21,713 --> 00:16:25,706
It is. It's very pretty.
I don't know about living down here.

273
00:16:25,783 --> 00:16:30,846
I like to visit, but I like to go home
to the Upper East Side.

274
00:16:30,922 --> 00:16:35,950
You wouldn't consider it?
After we get married, move to the Village.

275
00:16:36,027 --> 00:16:40,020
Why is marriage so important?
I just got out of a marriage.

276
00:16:40,098 --> 00:16:43,499
Just because we get
a signed piece of paper?

277
00:16:43,568 --> 00:16:45,695
You moved in with me.
We're a couple, right?

278
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:49,831
Yes, we moved in together.
We've been dating over a year now.

279
00:16:49,907 --> 00:16:52,000
I guess I'm old-fashioned.

280
00:16:52,076 --> 00:16:56,069
I know. All your girlfriends
are getting married...

281
00:16:56,147 --> 00:16:59,048
- Falk, what's up?
- Bob, how are you?

282
00:16:59,117 --> 00:17:01,779
Bob, this is Brooke.
Brooke, Bob Stiles.

283
00:17:01,853 --> 00:17:03,582
- How's it going?
- Falk and Brooke.

284
00:17:03,654 --> 00:17:06,623
This is Amanda.
This is Falk.

285
00:17:06,691 --> 00:17:08,420
This is Brooke.

286
00:17:09,694 --> 00:17:11,855
So, what are you guys doing down here?

287
00:17:11,929 --> 00:17:15,023
She just bought her dad
a ridiculous birthday present.

288
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:18,899
You think it's ridiculous.
I think it's great.

289
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:21,370
Let them see it.
Maybe I'm wrong.

290
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,704
- Oh, that's a...
- A turn-of-the century stereopticon.

291
00:17:24,776 --> 00:17:26,175
You knew that.

292
00:17:26,244 --> 00:17:30,078
Wait. It's complete
with pornographic slides.

293
00:17:30,148 --> 00:17:32,912
- Isn't it wonderful?
- I think it's brilliant.

294
00:17:32,984 --> 00:17:35,384
[Bob:] Just what he needs,
antique pornography.

295
00:17:35,453 --> 00:17:37,853
I always thought you had
a little yen for your dad.

296
00:17:37,922 --> 00:17:38,854
Ha ha.

297
00:17:38,923 --> 00:17:41,915
Hey! We're going to a great
Indian restaurant tomorrow night.

298
00:17:41,993 --> 00:17:44,291
We want to invite you.
I've hyped you to Amanda.

299
00:17:44,362 --> 00:17:47,092
- You can only disappoint.
- That sounds great.

300
00:17:47,165 --> 00:17:50,259
- Are we busy tomorrow night?
- We're taking my parents out.

301
00:17:50,334 --> 00:17:52,962
But that was tentative, I thought.

302
00:17:53,037 --> 00:17:57,167
- You hate Indian food.
- "Hate." That's a strong word.

303
00:17:57,241 --> 00:17:59,607
I've wanted to give it a second chance

304
00:17:59,677 --> 00:18:03,477
since I realized how much you...
she loves tandoori chicken.

305
00:18:03,548 --> 00:18:07,006
- Come on. It'll be fun.
- I should give it another shot.

306
00:18:07,085 --> 00:18:10,953
What I love about Bogart
is that he's so intensely urban.

307
00:18:11,022 --> 00:18:15,425
The cigarette,
the five o'clock shadow.

308
00:18:15,493 --> 00:18:17,961
Always in some seedy nightclub.

309
00:18:18,029 --> 00:18:22,523
Didn't I say that exact same thing
about Frank Sinatra? Urban.

310
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,660
Exactly. I even used the term.
That's...

311
00:18:25,736 --> 00:18:27,465
Where did you go to school?

312
00:18:27,538 --> 00:18:31,941
Ethical culture. Fieldston.
Brandeis. But I dropped out.

313
00:18:32,009 --> 00:18:35,570
One of her professors
fell in love with her.

314
00:18:35,646 --> 00:18:38,410
It was terrible.
He was married.

315
00:18:38,483 --> 00:18:42,044
It was way too much pressure
for all of us. His poor wife!

316
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:46,420
In addition to acting,
she's a very good singer.

317
00:18:46,491 --> 00:18:51,394
I try to sing, but then I hear someone
like Billie Holiday, and forget about it!

318
00:18:51,462 --> 00:18:54,329
She's your favorite!

319
00:18:54,398 --> 00:18:57,629
But you can't listen to the CD's, right?
They sterilize the sound.

320
00:18:57,702 --> 00:19:01,468
Didn't I say that?
I absolutely agree with you.

321
00:19:01,539 --> 00:19:04,736
It totally sterilizes...
that's so funny.

322
00:19:04,809 --> 00:19:08,836
Actually, someone told me
about this seedy record store

323
00:19:08,913 --> 00:19:13,282
that has all of her old recordings
on 78s and 33s.

324
00:19:13,351 --> 00:19:17,481
I'd love to know about it.
She is amazing.

325
00:19:18,356 --> 00:19:21,120
It's early.
Let's go to the Village Vanguard.

326
00:19:21,192 --> 00:19:25,356
Diana Krall is playing.
It should be a great show.

327
00:19:25,429 --> 00:19:29,923
I'll get so discouraged,
but I am dying to see her.

328
00:19:30,001 --> 00:19:32,663
- Great.
- You get up so early to write.

329
00:19:32,737 --> 00:19:36,605
Yeah, but I did most of my stuff
for tomorrow, so...

330
00:19:36,674 --> 00:19:39,472
- Should we? What do you...
- Yeah, sure.

331
00:19:39,544 --> 00:19:43,844
# Hide your heart from sight

332
00:19:43,915 --> 00:19:47,783
# Lock your dreams at night

333
00:19:47,852 --> 00:19:52,255
# It could happen to you

334
00:19:55,026 --> 00:19:58,484
# Don't count stars
Or you might stumble

335
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,527
# Someone drops a sigh

336
00:20:04,602 --> 00:20:09,801
# And down you tumble

337
00:20:09,874 --> 00:20:14,208
# Keep an eye on spring

338
00:20:14,278 --> 00:20:18,408
# Run when church bells ring

339
00:20:18,482 --> 00:20:23,852
# It could happen to you

340
00:20:25,089 --> 00:20:28,149
She's so moving.

341
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:33,890
I agree. She's totally moving.

342
00:20:33,965 --> 00:20:37,196
Absolutely.
You've captured her.

343
00:20:40,571 --> 00:20:43,699
[Applause]

344
00:20:45,409 --> 00:20:47,536
What was I saying?

345
00:20:47,612 --> 00:20:50,945
I'd love to take one of those boats
down the Amazon.

346
00:20:51,015 --> 00:20:53,108
It's supposed to be so beautiful.

347
00:20:53,184 --> 00:20:54,811
Not tonight?

348
00:20:57,021 --> 00:21:02,857
Of course not tonight.
I was... that's funny.

349
00:21:02,927 --> 00:21:07,523
But how thrilling that would be.
That would be so thrilling.

350
00:21:07,598 --> 00:21:10,226
You hate heat.
You hate mosquitoes.

351
00:21:10,301 --> 00:21:15,739
I hate malaria. It's malaria, remember?
I don't hate all mosquitoes.

352
00:21:15,806 --> 00:21:19,765
I want to see the parrots
and the giant butterflies.

353
00:21:19,844 --> 00:21:23,541
I've seen pictures in National Geographic.
They're gorgeous!

354
00:21:23,614 --> 00:21:27,607
Giant, huge...
And wild monkeys would be...

355
00:21:27,685 --> 00:21:31,781
Monkeys?
How much have you had to drink?

356
00:21:31,856 --> 00:21:33,551
Do you like snakes?

357
00:21:33,624 --> 00:21:35,592
Do I like snakes?

358
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:39,756
Some people get queasy around them,
but I think they're beautiful.

359
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:42,856
The way they move...
it's so sensual.

360
00:21:42,933 --> 00:21:47,393
So sen... I love snakes.
Cobras, for example.

361
00:21:47,471 --> 00:21:49,837
- Pythons.
- Naturally. Pythons.

362
00:21:49,907 --> 00:21:52,569
Garters. Rattlesnakes.
I love them all.

363
00:21:52,643 --> 00:21:56,909
- I cannot believe I'm hearing this.
- Oh, please.

364
00:21:56,981 --> 00:22:02,419
I've often said, often, that there's
nothing like a dense jungle in the rain.

365
00:22:02,486 --> 00:22:04,716
- I've said this.
- [Brooke:] You're drunk.

366
00:22:04,789 --> 00:22:06,916
- That's not true.
- Speaking of rain,

367
00:22:06,991 --> 00:22:09,255
there's supposed to be
a hurricane tonight.

368
00:22:09,327 --> 00:22:11,955
We should rent a car
and drive to the Hamptons.

369
00:22:12,029 --> 00:22:14,896
- We could walk on the beach...
- He hates the Hamptons.

370
00:22:14,965 --> 00:22:16,990
Nobody hates the ocean.

371
00:22:17,068 --> 00:22:22,165
She's up for anything.
It's too late for me. I can't.

372
00:22:22,239 --> 00:22:25,174
Don't you have an audition tomorrow?

373
00:22:25,242 --> 00:22:29,110
"My candle burns at both ends,
it will not last the night."

374
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:33,241
Millay! Edna Millay!
She's my favorite poet!

375
00:22:33,317 --> 00:22:36,878
Don't I quote her all the time?
Edna Millay...

376
00:22:38,456 --> 00:22:40,549
Amanda's pretty, isn't she?

377
00:22:42,293 --> 00:22:45,990
- She's okay, I suppose.
- You're drunk.

378
00:22:46,063 --> 00:22:48,224
I was looking at her face
in the candlelight

379
00:22:48,299 --> 00:22:53,168
and she has this offbeat sexual quality.

380
00:22:53,237 --> 00:22:56,502
Yeah, I guess.
Lf, uh, you know,

381
00:22:56,574 --> 00:23:00,066
if you find that crippling sense

382
00:23:00,144 --> 00:23:04,478
of passionate heat
behind those big eyes sexy.

383
00:23:04,548 --> 00:23:06,607
- Huh?
- Hmm?

384
00:23:06,684 --> 00:23:09,653
- Nothing.
- Bob's crazy about her.

385
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,689
I got the whole story while you were
in the men's room throwing up.

386
00:23:12,757 --> 00:23:15,282
I'm fine.
Believe me, I'm okay.

387
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:18,556
She moved in with him
and I get the feeling

388
00:23:18,629 --> 00:23:21,154
he is dying to marry her.

389
00:23:21,232 --> 00:23:24,531
- Oh, yeah?
- They make a nice couple.

390
00:23:24,602 --> 00:23:27,298
He's charming and very attractive.

391
00:23:27,371 --> 00:23:29,168
Are you okay?

392
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,800
Yeah.

393
00:23:48,592 --> 00:23:51,993
Amanda? Hey, it's Jerry Falk.

394
00:23:52,062 --> 00:23:53,757
Good, good. You?

395
00:23:53,831 --> 00:23:58,768
Listen, I was just about to go to
this old record store I found out about.

396
00:23:58,836 --> 00:24:02,533
I know you were interested
in picking up some Billie Holiday.

397
00:24:02,606 --> 00:24:07,600
I'm actually vaguely near your house,
so I thought that, um...

398
00:24:07,678 --> 00:24:10,977
I mean, if you and Bob are busy...

399
00:24:12,683 --> 00:24:18,144
Right. Of course. He would be at work.
What was I thinking?

400
00:24:18,222 --> 00:24:23,057
I could be there pretty soon.
Maybe, say, three minutes?

401
00:24:23,126 --> 00:24:27,256
Great. I'll meet you in front
of your place. Bye.

402
00:25:16,213 --> 00:25:17,840
These are great.

403
00:25:17,915 --> 00:25:22,443
Let me get you this Diana Krall record
as a present

404
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:26,011
since I know how big of a fan you are.

405
00:25:26,089 --> 00:25:28,887
- Wasn't she great the other night?
- So great.

406
00:25:28,959 --> 00:25:32,258
I love that you appreciate old songs.
They're so pretty.

407
00:25:32,329 --> 00:25:34,763
I'd love to hear you sing sometime.

408
00:25:34,831 --> 00:25:38,267
I can't sing publicly.
I'm too fat.

409
00:25:38,335 --> 00:25:43,034
- Fat? I'm sorry. Did you say fat?
- But I have these great diet pills.

410
00:25:43,106 --> 00:25:47,236
They take away your appetite,
but increase your sexual drive.

411
00:25:49,313 --> 00:25:52,043
Is that how you met Bob?

412
00:25:52,115 --> 00:25:54,447
From his record company?

413
00:25:54,518 --> 00:25:57,453
No. He picked me up
in Central Park, actually.

414
00:25:57,521 --> 00:25:59,079
Oh, how funny.

415
00:25:59,156 --> 00:26:03,286
And you guys got...
seriously involved?

416
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,693
No. He'd like to, but...

417
00:26:06,763 --> 00:26:08,822
I can't commit.

418
00:26:08,899 --> 00:26:11,026
I have a problem with commitment.

419
00:26:11,101 --> 00:26:15,595
I dream of meeting someone
who I'll want to give myself over to,

420
00:26:15,672 --> 00:26:18,300
where I'd be the one
hurt in the end.

421
00:26:18,375 --> 00:26:22,311
But it hasn't happened yet. You?

422
00:26:22,379 --> 00:26:23,778
Me neither.

423
00:26:23,847 --> 00:26:27,578
Um, unfortunately, same here.

424
00:26:27,651 --> 00:26:31,951
Brooke and I are in
the last stages, basically.

425
00:26:32,022 --> 00:26:33,546
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

426
00:26:33,624 --> 00:26:36,718
- She didn't give me that impression.
- She didn't?

427
00:26:36,793 --> 00:26:42,288
Well, that's strange, because that's
the only impression to give, really.

428
00:26:42,366 --> 00:26:46,029
Oh! Look at this, uh, record.
Cole Porter.

429
00:26:46,103 --> 00:26:50,267
This is a fantas...
really pretty songs on here.

430
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:54,208
Let me get you this as a little present.
Can I do that?

431
00:26:54,277 --> 00:26:58,805
I was actually listening to this last night,
and I thought of you.

432
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:02,817
You were listening to Cole Porter
and thought of me?

433
00:27:04,154 --> 00:27:06,588
You must really have a crush on me.

434
00:27:07,391 --> 00:27:09,689
I do?

435
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,058
I'd say it's fatal.

436
00:27:23,507 --> 00:27:27,102
I'm sorry.
I, uh... I couldn't resist.

437
00:27:28,278 --> 00:27:31,111
Don't apologize.
I wanted you to.

438
00:27:31,181 --> 00:27:33,081
You did?

439
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:36,347
Yes. I've had a crush on you
since we met.

440
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:39,912
Couldn't you tell,
the way I was ignoring you?

441
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:45,860
Well, there was something
compelling about your apathy.

442
00:27:45,929 --> 00:27:52,596
I thought you were sweet
and sensitive and vulnerable.

443
00:27:52,669 --> 00:27:55,035
And I could tell you liked me, too.

444
00:27:58,375 --> 00:28:00,900
I can't believe
I'm in love with a smoker.

445
00:28:02,245 --> 00:28:04,907
I don't want anyone to get hurt.

446
00:28:08,351 --> 00:28:11,320
Where were you?
It's 10:00.

447
00:28:11,388 --> 00:28:15,449
Where?
Well, um, I had a meeting to go to.

448
00:28:15,525 --> 00:28:17,652
- You smell from alcohol.
- I do?

449
00:28:17,728 --> 00:28:20,253
My God, your tongue is black!

450
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:22,662
It is? Well, um...

451
00:28:22,733 --> 00:28:25,258
that's because I had some wine.

452
00:28:25,335 --> 00:28:27,667
Wine? Why?
It's not Passover.

453
00:28:27,738 --> 00:28:31,799
No. Uh, to celebrate.
Uh, the deal.

454
00:28:31,875 --> 00:28:33,365
What deal?

455
00:28:33,443 --> 00:28:37,607
I have to tell you, um, it looks like
I have a great opportunity

456
00:28:37,681 --> 00:28:40,149
to work for, for, um, a very,

457
00:28:40,217 --> 00:28:42,981
very funny, uh, puppet.

458
00:28:43,053 --> 00:28:46,113
It's, uh... remember I...

459
00:28:46,189 --> 00:28:48,555
Is this a woman's hair?

460
00:28:53,797 --> 00:28:57,528
Is this...
is this a woman's hair?

461
00:28:57,601 --> 00:29:01,697
I mean, it could be...

462
00:29:01,772 --> 00:29:04,070
I suppose.

463
00:29:04,141 --> 00:29:06,302
Possibly from, uh, the taxi.

464
00:29:06,376 --> 00:29:10,540
It was... I mean, I think, you know,
all the people in and out,

465
00:29:10,614 --> 00:29:13,208
I probably sat up in...

466
00:29:13,283 --> 00:29:16,844
I guess, the woman's hair.
I am exhausted.

467
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:20,048
She asked me if I still love her.
What could I say?

468
00:29:20,123 --> 00:29:23,820
Why can't I tell her the truth?
I'm in love with Amanda.

469
00:29:23,894 --> 00:29:27,557
Why can't I tell her it's over?
Why can't I leave people?

470
00:29:27,631 --> 00:29:29,326
Tell me about your dream.

471
00:29:29,399 --> 00:29:32,027
The Cleveland Indians gotjobs
at Toys R Us?

472
00:29:32,102 --> 00:29:34,570
Yeah. So what can it possibly mean?

473
00:29:34,638 --> 00:29:39,041
Look, I can't keep wasting my hour here
describing lunatic dreams.

474
00:29:39,109 --> 00:29:41,737
I have a date with Amanda.

475
00:29:41,812 --> 00:29:45,407
I can't keep running around town
on the sly and live like this.

476
00:29:45,482 --> 00:29:48,451
Amanda can handle it,
but I need help.

477
00:29:48,518 --> 00:29:52,511
What do I do? I have to
extricate myself from Brooke.

478
00:29:52,589 --> 00:29:55,649
It'll break her heart.
She wants to marry me!

479
00:29:59,496 --> 00:30:02,522
The guy will not talk.
I've been with him for three years.

480
00:30:02,599 --> 00:30:04,931
What comes to mind
about the Cleveland Indians?

481
00:30:05,001 --> 00:30:08,095
See? This is what I get.
I need a course of action,

482
00:30:08,171 --> 00:30:13,438
and he wants me to free-associate
about the Cleveland Indians.

483
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:17,742
[Amanda:] I love doing it in hotels.
It's so illicit.

484
00:30:17,814 --> 00:30:22,012
Check yourself for shoulder-length hairs
in hard-to-justify locations.

485
00:30:22,085 --> 00:30:25,577
I have to decide how to
let Brooke down gracefully.

486
00:30:25,655 --> 00:30:29,614
There's no rush.
I've been the other woman before.

487
00:30:29,693 --> 00:30:32,059
Bob wasn't upset when you told him?

488
00:30:32,128 --> 00:30:36,497
He was disappointed.
But I was honest about myself going in.

489
00:30:36,566 --> 00:30:40,502
Naturally, I didn't tell him
it was you I was in love with.

490
00:30:44,541 --> 00:30:45,633
Brooke...

491
00:30:45,709 --> 00:30:48,507
Don't give me that!
I don't believe you!

492
00:30:48,578 --> 00:30:52,674
Those are bite marks on your back.
You didn't fall on your comb!

493
00:30:54,184 --> 00:30:57,153
What are you thinking about?

494
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,710
Everything.

495
00:30:58,788 --> 00:31:03,020
When we first met,
when Brooke found out.

496
00:31:03,092 --> 00:31:09,088
Remember that? Or when we checked
into that hotel as S. And Z. Fitzgerald.

497
00:31:09,165 --> 00:31:12,896
Or how we made love everywhere.
God, everywhere.

498
00:31:12,969 --> 00:31:16,234
When I think of all the risky places

499
00:31:16,306 --> 00:31:20,333
that lust overcame the two of us,
it blows my mind.

500
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:23,277
You know Fireside Memorial Chapel
is a McDonald's now?

501
00:31:23,346 --> 00:31:27,077
Fascinating.

502
00:31:43,166 --> 00:31:44,758
Don't.

503
00:31:44,834 --> 00:31:46,267
- Why not?
- I can't.

504
00:31:46,336 --> 00:31:49,237
What do you mean?
It's not natural.

505
00:31:49,305 --> 00:31:51,170
We never sleep with each other.

506
00:31:51,241 --> 00:31:53,903
I told you I'm going
through a rough patch.

507
00:31:53,977 --> 00:31:56,844
I'll say.
It's been six months!

508
00:31:56,913 --> 00:31:58,938
I said you could sleep
with other women.

509
00:31:59,015 --> 00:32:01,677
I don't love other women.

510
00:32:01,751 --> 00:32:04,276
I don't want to sleep
with other women. I love you.

511
00:32:04,354 --> 00:32:07,687
What did I do to turn you off?
I don't get it.

512
00:32:07,757 --> 00:32:11,488
Nothing. You did nothing.
It's always about you.

513
00:32:11,561 --> 00:32:14,359
- You have such an ego.
- An ego?

514
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:18,890
What do you want me to do?
Grit my teeth, close my eyes,

515
00:32:18,968 --> 00:32:21,163
hold myself stiff
and let you do it to me?

516
00:32:21,237 --> 00:32:26,038
It's getting to the point
where I may settle for that.

517
00:32:26,109 --> 00:32:29,408
Sometimes I think it's because
you remind me of my father.

518
00:32:29,479 --> 00:32:34,507
You once told me you thought your father
was sexually attractive.

519
00:32:34,584 --> 00:32:37,178
That's not the part of him
you remind me of.

520
00:32:37,253 --> 00:32:40,620
It's not?
What is it, then?

521
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:43,284
You know, his professional manner.

522
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:46,658
Sweet and supportive.

523
00:32:46,729 --> 00:32:52,634
Gee, I'm sorry I have so many
turn-off qualities. I didn't realize.

524
00:32:57,573 --> 00:33:02,135
Sleep with other women.
Just don't tell me about it.

525
00:33:02,211 --> 00:33:05,146
- Do you love me?
- What a question!

526
00:33:05,214 --> 00:33:08,342
Just because I pull away
when you touch me?

527
00:33:09,686 --> 00:33:12,246
[Dobel:] "Just because I pull away
when you touch me?"

528
00:33:12,322 --> 00:33:16,486
- Falk, give me a break.
- She said it was temporary.

529
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:20,154
Meanwhile, you haven't consummated
your passion for her in six months!

530
00:33:20,229 --> 00:33:26,930
It's unbelievable! I have a theory
that too much rejection causes cancer.

531
00:33:27,003 --> 00:33:29,233
She encourages me
to sleep with other women.

532
00:33:29,305 --> 00:33:31,398
Well, do it! For God's sakes!

533
00:33:31,474 --> 00:33:35,934
There must be a million women who'd
be excited to get into bed with you.

534
00:33:36,012 --> 00:33:37,445
Maybe not a million,

535
00:33:37,513 --> 00:33:40,380
but I'm sure you could find one,
if you got her drunk enough.

536
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:44,284
It doesn't matter.
I have no interest in other women.

537
00:33:44,354 --> 00:33:49,656
- See, even my first wife was...
- Wife? You were married?

538
00:33:49,726 --> 00:33:53,184
A bitter story.
I was very young.

539
00:33:53,262 --> 00:33:56,527
I should have known something
was wrong on the wedding night

540
00:33:56,599 --> 00:34:02,538
when her family danced around my table
chanting, "We will make him one of us!"

541
00:34:02,605 --> 00:34:06,974
Oh, boy! I had a rough day.

542
00:34:07,043 --> 00:34:11,571
I got up, put on a shirt
and the button came off.

543
00:34:11,647 --> 00:34:16,175
Then I went to the car to open the door,
and the handle came off.

544
00:34:16,252 --> 00:34:19,119
Now I'm afraid
to go to the bathroom.

545
00:34:21,457 --> 00:34:25,553
What did you do?
I wanted to grab the check.

546
00:34:25,628 --> 00:34:28,358
- No, you didn't.
- What do you mean? I did.

547
00:34:28,431 --> 00:34:30,456
I was grabbing the check.

548
00:34:30,533 --> 00:34:33,934
Never trust a guy
who fumbles for the check.

549
00:34:34,003 --> 00:34:36,130
He who wants to get the check,
gets it.

550
00:34:36,205 --> 00:34:40,539
As you go through life, when you
really want to get the check, you will.

551
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:43,477
- Well, I was planning on getting it.
- Let me ask you...

552
00:34:43,546 --> 00:34:45,537
Did you hear what that guy said?

553
00:34:45,615 --> 00:34:49,244
Three people were coming in
as we were leaving.

554
00:34:49,318 --> 00:34:51,343
The swarthy guy?

555
00:34:51,421 --> 00:34:54,618
Yeah. Dark.
There were two guys and a girl.

556
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:56,749
- I didn't hear him.
- He looked at us,

557
00:34:56,826 --> 00:35:00,819
and said to the other guy:
"Jews start all wars."

558
00:35:00,897 --> 00:35:02,057
- Did you hear that?
- No!

559
00:35:02,131 --> 00:35:07,467
Yes, absolutely. He presumably
said it to her or the guy with them,

560
00:35:07,537 --> 00:35:11,871
but it was really for our benefit.
"Jews start all wars."

561
00:35:11,941 --> 00:35:17,846
I don't think it was for my benefit
because I didn't hear anything.

562
00:35:17,914 --> 00:35:21,213
I know who you're talking about.
I saw this trio,

563
00:35:21,284 --> 00:35:24,481
but I didn't hear anything
and I have pretty good hearing.

564
00:35:24,654 --> 00:35:28,988
Because you were obsessed with
the physically prepossessing waitresses

565
00:35:29,058 --> 00:35:31,049
running around.

566
00:35:31,127 --> 00:35:34,153
Let me tell you, Falk.
We live in perilous times.

567
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:36,790
You got to keep alert for these things.

568
00:35:36,866 --> 00:35:40,302
You don't want your life to wind up
as black-and-white newsreel footage

569
00:35:40,369 --> 00:35:45,363
scored by a cello in a minor key.

570
00:35:48,511 --> 00:35:50,604
- Hey.
- Hi.

571
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:53,513
- How are you?
- Good. How was the comedian?

572
00:35:53,583 --> 00:35:56,177
It's exactly like Dobel says.

573
00:35:56,252 --> 00:36:00,279
There is truly a paucity
of veridical talent in the world.

574
00:36:00,356 --> 00:36:02,187
When will I meet this polymath?

575
00:36:02,258 --> 00:36:05,227
He is unbelievable.
He's read everything.

576
00:36:05,294 --> 00:36:08,957
He plays music.
He paints, or so he claims.

577
00:36:09,031 --> 00:36:11,329
I've read some of his poems...
all morbid!

578
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:14,927
Cancer and shock treatments
and gas chambers.

579
00:36:15,004 --> 00:36:20,306
And his vocabulary is astounding.
You can't get the guy on a word.

580
00:36:20,376 --> 00:36:23,004
It's rare you're so taken with somebody.

581
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:24,239
Hey, Mrs. Chase.

582
00:36:24,313 --> 00:36:27,282
I told you not to call me Mrs. Chase!
My name is Paula!

583
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:31,946
Mrs. Chase makes me sound ancient.
My life isn't over yet.

584
00:36:32,021 --> 00:36:34,854
- In fact, I'm just starting to live it.
- Definitely, Paula.

585
00:36:34,924 --> 00:36:36,983
And I need some help from you.

586
00:36:37,059 --> 00:36:40,586
Mom, could you talk about this tomorrow?
It's late.

587
00:36:40,663 --> 00:36:44,292
What, are we six years old?
It's past our bedtime?

588
00:36:44,367 --> 00:36:46,801
It's okay. It's only 1:30.

589
00:36:46,869 --> 00:36:50,930
I decided to put some songs together
and do a nightclub act.

590
00:36:51,007 --> 00:36:55,740
Mother, the scene has really changed
in the past 25 years.

591
00:36:55,811 --> 00:36:59,042
- Why are you so discouraging?
- I'm not. I'm realistic.

592
00:36:59,115 --> 00:37:01,310
I don't want you to get hurt.

593
00:37:01,384 --> 00:37:03,249
How? I could always sing.

594
00:37:03,319 --> 00:37:06,379
Of course you can sing.
I'm not saying that.

595
00:37:06,455 --> 00:37:10,152
But things change.
Styles, the cabaret business...

596
00:37:10,226 --> 00:37:13,218
Can't you be more supportive?
You're so competitive!

597
00:37:13,296 --> 00:37:16,094
I am not!
I hate my voice!

598
00:37:16,165 --> 00:37:19,157
[Falk:] Please.
You both have very good voices.

599
00:37:19,235 --> 00:37:22,329
I thought I'd put a few songs together

600
00:37:22,405 --> 00:37:25,374
and you could write
between-the-songs talk for me.

601
00:37:25,441 --> 00:37:29,673
- I've never done that sort of thing.
- Just some banter. Notjokes.

602
00:37:29,745 --> 00:37:32,942
I couldn't tell a joke if my life
depended on it. Just some chit-chat.

603
00:37:33,015 --> 00:37:36,041
The truth is,
I'm kind of snowed under right now...

604
00:37:36,118 --> 00:37:40,054
Oh, God!
Is nobody on my side?

605
00:37:40,122 --> 00:37:44,149
Jerry, you could do it.
This stuff comes so easily to you.

606
00:37:44,226 --> 00:37:46,990
- You just said this is a fool's errand.
- What did you call me?

607
00:37:47,063 --> 00:37:49,691
It's an expression.

608
00:37:49,765 --> 00:37:54,759
I know. I tried to dissuade her,
but she won't listen to me.

609
00:37:54,837 --> 00:37:58,568
I'm trying to finish my book.
These comics are pressing me.

610
00:37:58,641 --> 00:38:02,133
- I've taken deposits from them.
- Oh, forget I even asked.

611
00:38:02,211 --> 00:38:04,805
Okay. I never said I wouldn't do it.

612
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,075
I just have to fit it in.

613
00:38:07,149 --> 00:38:09,640
It won't be arduous!
I have lots of ideas!

614
00:38:09,719 --> 00:38:11,880
I'm even having a piano delivered!

615
00:38:11,954 --> 00:38:14,388
- [Falk:] Here?
- It's a rental.

616
00:38:14,457 --> 00:38:17,915
- I had to rehearse!
- There's no room for a piano.

617
00:38:17,994 --> 00:38:20,519
Because you don't maximize your space!

618
00:38:20,596 --> 00:38:23,827
I was an interior decorator.
Tell him, Amanda.

619
00:38:26,068 --> 00:38:30,437
I know this is a real pain,
but it's temporary.

620
00:38:30,506 --> 00:38:32,633
You mean like our lovemaking?

621
00:38:32,708 --> 00:38:35,108
Could you not be gross?

622
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:41,180
[Falk:] As the days passed,
Dobel and I got closer and closer.

623
00:38:41,249 --> 00:38:44,650
After he finished school,
we'd meet in Central Park.

624
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:47,517
He'd usually expound on something.

625
00:38:47,588 --> 00:38:50,216
[Dobel:] You think quantum physics
has the answer?

626
00:38:50,291 --> 00:38:54,421
I mean, what purpose
does it serve for me

627
00:38:54,495 --> 00:38:57,760
that time and space
are exactly the same thing?

628
00:38:57,832 --> 00:39:01,324
I ask a guy what time it is,
he tells me six miles?

629
00:39:01,402 --> 00:39:02,835
What the hell is that?

630
00:39:02,904 --> 00:39:08,171
Falk, if a guy comes out onstage
at Carnegie Hall and throws up,

631
00:39:08,242 --> 00:39:11,939
you can always find some people
who will call it art.

632
00:39:12,013 --> 00:39:15,039
Years ago, a very wonderful comedy writer

633
00:39:15,116 --> 00:39:20,918
wrote a very funny book
with a really deep and meaningful title.

634
00:39:20,988 --> 00:39:24,822
It was called
"Never Trust A Naked Bus Driver."

635
00:39:25,727 --> 00:39:28,491
You would be amazed how many people

636
00:39:28,563 --> 00:39:32,397
do exactly that, and worse.

637
00:39:32,467 --> 00:39:35,231
- [Dobel:] Do you masturbate, Falk?
- What?

638
00:39:35,303 --> 00:39:39,763
I mean, given the circumstances
of your sex life, I would think...

639
00:39:39,841 --> 00:39:42,742
This is not... stop squirming.

640
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:46,746
I'm not. I don't know.
Now and then, I guess.

641
00:39:46,814 --> 00:39:49,374
When is now and then?
On Easter and Purim?

642
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:51,213
I don't really enjoy it.

643
00:39:51,285 --> 00:39:53,446
Are you doing it right?
Does your hand fall asleep?

644
00:39:53,521 --> 00:39:57,457
I happen to think it's
a poor substitute for the real thing.

645
00:39:57,525 --> 00:40:00,187
Really? I prefer it to the real thing.

646
00:40:00,261 --> 00:40:02,286
Last night, I was home by myself

647
00:40:02,363 --> 00:40:09,269
and I conjured up a threesome with me,
Marilyn Monroe and Sophia Loren.

648
00:40:09,337 --> 00:40:12,602
It was very erotic.

649
00:40:12,673 --> 00:40:15,039
In fact, if I'm not mistaken,
it was the first time

650
00:40:15,109 --> 00:40:17,907
those two great actresses
ever appeared in anything together.

651
00:40:17,979 --> 00:40:22,416
- It sounds nice, but...
- The only reason I ask

652
00:40:22,483 --> 00:40:25,748
is because I think
that as you go through life,

653
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:28,846
you learn to depend only on yourself.

654
00:40:28,923 --> 00:40:32,723
You know?
Do you own a firearm?

655
00:40:32,794 --> 00:40:34,421
A gun?

656
00:40:34,495 --> 00:40:36,861
A gun qualifies as a firearm, yes.

657
00:40:36,931 --> 00:40:39,456
- No. Why would I?
- For self-defense.

658
00:40:39,534 --> 00:40:42,196
Against who?

659
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:44,602
Against those who conspire to harm you.

660
00:40:44,672 --> 00:40:45,866
Harm me?

661
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:51,708
Don't ask what you did to deserve it.
I mean, God, read Auden.

662
00:40:51,779 --> 00:40:58,116
You know, come with me to New Jersey.

663
00:41:00,888 --> 00:41:05,655
Falk, I took the liberty a few weeks ago
of ordering you a little present.

664
00:41:05,726 --> 00:41:06,920
What?

665
00:41:06,994 --> 00:41:11,488
They're having a sale here
on surplus Russian army rifles.

666
00:41:11,565 --> 00:41:13,055
What?

667
00:41:13,133 --> 00:41:17,502
Suppose you're home one night
in bed, masturbating,

668
00:41:17,571 --> 00:41:20,972
and some guys break in.
You need protection.

669
00:41:21,041 --> 00:41:23,635
I'd dial 911.
I don't need a rifle.

670
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:26,702
Have you ever dialed 911?
It's like trying to get a mortgage.

671
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:29,010
Come on.

672
00:41:30,617 --> 00:41:34,644
I don't need a rifle. I'll probably
wind up blowing my foot off.

673
00:41:34,721 --> 00:41:37,349
What is wrong with you?
Are you such a maladroit

674
00:41:37,424 --> 00:41:42,361
you can't keep a firearm without
discharging it adventitiously?

675
00:41:42,429 --> 00:41:44,920
- I don't need a weapon.
- Everybody needs a weapon.

676
00:41:44,998 --> 00:41:46,192
What does that mean?

677
00:41:46,266 --> 00:41:48,962
It means the day will come
when you wish you had one.

678
00:41:49,036 --> 00:41:50,526
Why exactly?

679
00:41:50,604 --> 00:41:53,869
Why?
So they don't put you in a boxcar.

680
00:41:53,941 --> 00:41:56,205
I want to get you some of this stuff, too.

681
00:41:56,276 --> 00:41:59,575
- What for?
- So you can build a survival kit.

682
00:41:59,646 --> 00:42:03,138
I have a perfect survival kit.
I've been working on it for years.

683
00:42:03,217 --> 00:42:05,447
Last week I got some great fishhooks,

684
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:09,216
and a waterproof matchbox that floats.

685
00:42:09,289 --> 00:42:12,258
What are you preparing for,
the end of civilization?

686
00:42:12,326 --> 00:42:16,422
I have to know if I'm alone in the wilds,
I can survive by myself.

687
00:42:16,496 --> 00:42:18,020
Dobel, you're a madman.

688
00:42:18,098 --> 00:42:20,589
That's what they said in Germany.

689
00:42:20,667 --> 00:42:24,535
There were actually groups
in Germany called "Jews for Hitler."

690
00:42:24,605 --> 00:42:28,735
They were deluded.
They thought he'd be good for the country.

691
00:42:28,809 --> 00:42:33,143
Never trust a naked bus driver.

692
00:42:33,213 --> 00:42:36,273
By the time I got out of bed
and loaded it,

693
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:39,911
- the damage would be done.
- That's why you keep it loaded.

694
00:42:39,987 --> 00:42:42,251
I should keep a loaded gun in the house?

695
00:42:42,322 --> 00:42:45,348
Why would you keep
an unloaded weapon in the house?

696
00:42:45,425 --> 00:42:47,188
Do you keep a loaded gun in the house?

697
00:42:47,261 --> 00:42:51,197
I have a loaded weapon
in my house within reach.

698
00:42:51,265 --> 00:42:54,894
Within reach, Falk.
In every room.

699
00:42:54,968 --> 00:42:57,061
Just how crazy are you?
Is there more?

700
00:42:57,137 --> 00:43:00,436
Do you hear voices on the radio
or worship snakes?

701
00:43:00,507 --> 00:43:05,774
You are a member of one of the most
persecuted minorities in history.

702
00:43:05,846 --> 00:43:09,111
The rifle's on me.
Let me handle this.

703
00:43:10,183 --> 00:43:13,311
This makes me nervous.
I've never owned a weapon.

704
00:43:13,387 --> 00:43:17,346
You have to learn to take it apart
and put it together blindfolded.

705
00:43:17,424 --> 00:43:19,585
You may have to do it in the dark.

706
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:22,356
You expecting Nazis and a blackout?

707
00:43:22,429 --> 00:43:26,798
Incidentally, while you were rummaging
around the store in an aimless stupor,

708
00:43:26,867 --> 00:43:29,768
I got you a couple of items.

709
00:43:29,836 --> 00:43:32,737
I got you a flashlight that floats

710
00:43:32,806 --> 00:43:34,899
if you drop it in the ocean
for any reason.

711
00:43:34,975 --> 00:43:37,603
When the hell am I near the ocean?

712
00:43:37,678 --> 00:43:42,615
I want you to build a survival kit.
I got you a compass, a...

713
00:43:42,683 --> 00:43:46,141
I live in Manhattan.
Why would I need a compass?

714
00:43:46,219 --> 00:43:49,552
This flare gun.
I got you some snakebite stuff,

715
00:43:49,623 --> 00:43:52,717
fishhooks, water-purifying tablets.

716
00:43:52,793 --> 00:43:55,956
This all sounds a little excessive to me.

717
00:43:56,029 --> 00:43:58,395
And don't pull the trigger.

718
00:43:58,465 --> 00:44:00,865
Squeeze it. Squeeze the trigger.

719
00:44:00,934 --> 00:44:03,232
That's right.
Just take aim and squeeze...

720
00:44:03,303 --> 00:44:04,634
[gun clicking]

721
00:44:04,705 --> 00:44:07,674
Sorry! Sorry, sorry!
It's empty.

722
00:44:07,741 --> 00:44:11,609
Dobel was showing me how to use a rifle.
We were practicing.

723
00:44:11,678 --> 00:44:14,943
- Why?
- Why? Well, it's for protection.

724
00:44:15,015 --> 00:44:17,882
- From who?
- What do you mean, from who?

725
00:44:17,951 --> 00:44:19,782
- Dobel, tell her.
- I'm Dobel.

726
00:44:19,853 --> 00:44:23,550
Hi.
Who do you need protection from?

727
00:44:23,623 --> 00:44:26,387
Burglars, rapists, the Gestapo.

728
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:29,122
It was my idea that,
given the tensions in the world,

729
00:44:29,196 --> 00:44:31,187
perhaps it would be prudent

730
00:44:31,264 --> 00:44:35,132
for young Falk to own
a means of self-defense.

731
00:44:35,202 --> 00:44:39,036
Have you had a mental breakdown?
You and a rifle?

732
00:44:39,106 --> 00:44:41,870
- I know it seems weird.
- What's this stuff?

733
00:44:41,942 --> 00:44:47,175
This is all very important.
These are water-purifying tablets

734
00:44:47,247 --> 00:44:49,545
and that's a flashlight that floats.

735
00:44:49,616 --> 00:44:52,517
Let's say you drop it in the ocean.
It floats.

736
00:44:52,586 --> 00:44:54,645
Are you joining the Boy Scouts?

737
00:44:54,721 --> 00:44:57,315
- It's all very necessary.
- Are these bullets?

738
00:44:57,391 --> 00:45:01,828
They're called rounds. Right?
Jump in here at any point.

739
00:45:01,895 --> 00:45:05,092
Falk, I don't mean to incite
domestic strife here.

740
00:45:05,165 --> 00:45:09,659
Amanda, it's all very safe.
See what happens...

741
00:45:09,736 --> 00:45:11,966
what I do is take a pliers

742
00:45:12,038 --> 00:45:16,372
and I remove the lead part
from the shell. You see?

743
00:45:16,443 --> 00:45:20,106
Then I have the empty...
empty shell. Okay?

744
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:24,674
And what I do is I put this now
in the breech

745
00:45:24,751 --> 00:45:26,446
in the rifle, okay?

746
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:29,956
So then if a shot's taken,
it won't really fire.

747
00:45:30,023 --> 00:45:32,423
Not until the second round
goes into the breech.

748
00:45:32,492 --> 00:45:34,255
The chamber!
The chamber, Falk!

749
00:45:34,327 --> 00:45:36,352
Into the chamber.

750
00:45:36,430 --> 00:45:40,264
I am not living in the house
with a loaded rifle.

751
00:45:40,333 --> 00:45:44,030
You don't trust me to keep a firearm
without hurting anyone?

752
00:45:44,104 --> 00:45:46,402
- Am I an imbecile?
- Is that a trick question?

753
00:45:46,473 --> 00:45:49,704
Dobel, would you say something?

754
00:45:49,776 --> 00:45:54,076
It's his feeling that as the economy slumps,
crime rises, okay?

755
00:45:54,147 --> 00:45:58,413
And rape... rape has risen.
Statistically speaking, rape has gone up.

756
00:45:58,485 --> 00:46:02,717
And he's not convinced that
the slaughter of six million Jews

757
00:46:02,789 --> 00:46:06,452
is enough to satisfy the anti-Semitic
impulses of the majority of the world.

758
00:46:06,526 --> 00:46:09,654
- You said this.
- He's paraphrasing.

759
00:46:09,729 --> 00:46:11,788
I put it more succinctly when I...

760
00:46:11,865 --> 00:46:13,127
[door closing]
Oh!

761
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:17,603
Don't worry, Mother.
It's not loaded.

762
00:46:17,671 --> 00:46:20,640
- [Paula:] What's happening?
- I bought a rifle.

763
00:46:20,707 --> 00:46:24,268
A rifle?! I'm not living
in a house with a rifle!

764
00:46:24,344 --> 00:46:28,872
- Don't worry, Mom. It's leaving.
- No, it's not. It's not leaving.

765
00:46:28,949 --> 00:46:32,112
Perhaps we should rethink
the concept of self-defense.

766
00:46:32,185 --> 00:46:35,154
Mrs. Chase, is it unreasonable
to own a fire extinguisher,

767
00:46:35,222 --> 00:46:36,917
though you'll probably never use it?

768
00:46:36,990 --> 00:46:41,017
Stop calling me Mrs. Chase!
My name is Paula!

769
00:46:41,094 --> 00:46:43,790
I'm not your goddamn schoolteacher!

770
00:46:43,864 --> 00:46:48,233
Falk, urgent business in Tierra Del Fuego
requires my presence,

771
00:46:48,301 --> 00:46:49,461
so I'll be leaving.

772
00:46:49,536 --> 00:46:52,994
Sir, would you mind
helping me shift this piano?

773
00:46:53,073 --> 00:46:55,064
- Me?
- Mother, he's a guest.

774
00:46:55,141 --> 00:46:57,575
Would you take these when you go?
[Phone ringing]

775
00:46:57,644 --> 00:47:00,977
I don't care who he is.
This room isn't right.

776
00:47:01,047 --> 00:47:03,242
That's because it's too crowded.
[Phone ringing]

777
00:47:03,316 --> 00:47:06,114
Meaning what?
You want me on a park bench?

778
00:47:06,186 --> 00:47:09,587
Don't be so dramatic.
All I want out is this stupid rifle.

779
00:47:09,656 --> 00:47:11,886
Are you going to help me?

780
00:47:11,958 --> 00:47:14,552
I live to serve.
Make your wishes known.

781
00:47:14,628 --> 00:47:16,528
- Pivot. Pivot.
- Hello.

782
00:47:16,596 --> 00:47:18,621
Did I get you at a bad time?

783
00:47:18,698 --> 00:47:23,863
I just want to set the date
for the end of the week for lunch.

784
00:47:23,937 --> 00:47:25,564
How's Friday?

785
00:47:25,639 --> 00:47:28,836
Friday.
Hold on one second, Harvey.

786
00:47:28,909 --> 00:47:33,073
I have steamers in the fridge
from a week ago Sunday. You hungry?

787
00:47:33,146 --> 00:47:37,014
No. I make it a practice
never to ingest bivalves

788
00:47:37,083 --> 00:47:39,347
that have been dead more than 72 hours.

789
00:47:39,419 --> 00:47:42,047
Christ, I need a drink.
This room just isn't right.

790
00:47:42,122 --> 00:47:44,249
What are these?

791
00:47:44,324 --> 00:47:46,451
[Amanda:] Water-purifying tablets.

792
00:47:46,526 --> 00:47:48,756
What for?
Is the plumbing backed up?

793
00:47:48,828 --> 00:47:52,093
Thursday's better.
What do you want to talk about?

794
00:47:52,165 --> 00:47:56,602
The who, the what and the wherefore.
Thursday, Isabella's, at noon.

795
00:47:56,670 --> 00:47:59,161
- Right. Bye.
- [Paula:] No, you're doing it.

796
00:47:59,239 --> 00:48:02,265
- Just pivot it.
- What's happening here?

797
00:48:02,342 --> 00:48:04,970
I have it under control.
Nothing that can't be done

798
00:48:05,045 --> 00:48:07,946
with 12 stevedores and some oxen.

799
00:48:08,014 --> 00:48:11,177
- Paula, where do you want this?
- Against the wall.

800
00:48:11,251 --> 00:48:14,982
- I'll help you do it.
- Sir, would you take this?

801
00:48:15,055 --> 00:48:17,114
Mom, here you go.
[Glass shatters]

802
00:48:17,190 --> 00:48:19,988
[Paula:] Jesus, what a butterfingers!

803
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:22,221
Watch your hands
when you pick these up.

804
00:48:22,295 --> 00:48:24,889
- [Amanda:] These things happen.
- This can be glued.

805
00:48:30,369 --> 00:48:34,203
I don't understand why those people
could leave the room

806
00:48:34,273 --> 00:48:36,264
after the dinner party
and go home.

807
00:48:36,342 --> 00:48:37,900
- What'd you think?
- It was great.

808
00:48:37,977 --> 00:48:40,070
Yeah, I agree.

809
00:48:40,146 --> 00:48:42,410
Listen, I'm sorry about my mother.

810
00:48:42,481 --> 00:48:46,281
- I know she's been out of control.
- Don't worry about it.

811
00:48:46,352 --> 00:48:48,013
She is a little tough,

812
00:48:48,087 --> 00:48:51,784
but nevertheless, I will gladly
help her with her singing act.

813
00:48:51,857 --> 00:48:55,258
You are a sweetheart.
I don't know what I'd do without you.

814
00:48:55,328 --> 00:48:57,228
I've got a great idea.

815
00:48:57,296 --> 00:49:00,823
Instead of going home,
let's check into a hotel.

816
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:02,663
Let's check into a hotel!

817
00:49:02,735 --> 00:49:05,101
Maybe away from everything

818
00:49:05,171 --> 00:49:09,471
in a completely different atmosphere,
you'll be more relaxed.

819
00:49:09,542 --> 00:49:11,874
We used to check into hotels
all the time.

820
00:49:11,944 --> 00:49:16,108
- It was exciting and fun.
- But it was different then.

821
00:49:16,182 --> 00:49:19,015
But it won't be different.
It'll be just like we used to.

822
00:49:19,085 --> 00:49:21,110
Come on, it'll be great.

823
00:49:27,393 --> 00:49:30,419
Hi. How are you?

824
00:49:30,496 --> 00:49:33,397
We're interested in a single room.
How much is that?

825
00:49:33,466 --> 00:49:37,493
- A single room is $200 a night.
- $200. Wow.

826
00:49:37,570 --> 00:49:40,733
It's amazing how even
the cheapest ones have gone up.

827
00:49:40,806 --> 00:49:44,173
Let's not get a single.
It's so sleazy.

828
00:49:44,243 --> 00:49:46,711
We're trying to be romantic.

829
00:49:46,779 --> 00:49:50,647
You're right.
Um, do you have a small suite?

830
00:49:50,716 --> 00:49:52,775
- A small suite?
- Very small.

831
00:49:52,852 --> 00:49:55,912
Let me check.
I'll be right back.

832
00:50:03,896 --> 00:50:05,830
Wow!

833
00:50:05,898 --> 00:50:09,129
- Look at this place.
- It's nice.

834
00:50:13,139 --> 00:50:15,505
Thank you.
Have a good one.

835
00:50:15,574 --> 00:50:18,168
- How much did you give him?
- Three bucks.

836
00:50:18,244 --> 00:50:19,711
Not five?

837
00:50:19,779 --> 00:50:22,907
Five?
He just turned the light on.

838
00:50:22,982 --> 00:50:26,850
We have no luggage.
Should I have given him five?

839
00:50:26,919 --> 00:50:30,150
It doesn't matter.
I'm sorry. I'm just tense.

840
00:50:30,222 --> 00:50:34,318
This is fun, isn't it?
It's kind of sexy, being back in a hotel.

841
00:50:34,393 --> 00:50:36,953
Should we order caviar?

842
00:50:37,029 --> 00:50:40,965
Caviar? You just had
all that popcorn at the movie.

843
00:50:41,033 --> 00:50:44,059
Plus the peppermints
and the ice cream sandwich.

844
00:50:44,136 --> 00:50:47,970
I know.
I'm definitely going on a diet tomorrow.

845
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:50,474
I can't believe how much they charge
for a suite.

846
00:50:50,543 --> 00:50:53,103
It's not what I expected.

847
00:50:53,179 --> 00:50:56,478
- Is that what you're thinking about?
- No.

848
00:50:56,549 --> 00:51:02,317
No, I'm thinking of you
and how sexy you are.

849
00:51:03,923 --> 00:51:08,519
- I need another.
- Come here. What's wrong?

850
00:51:08,594 --> 00:51:12,860
- It's too bright.
- Too bright?

851
00:51:12,932 --> 00:51:16,629
Okay, well, I can fix that, I guess.

852
00:51:17,670 --> 00:51:20,730
- Is that better?
- No, it's still too bright.

853
00:51:20,806 --> 00:51:23,468
Really?
Yes! You know how hard this is for me.

854
00:51:23,542 --> 00:51:28,070
Maybe it's because of this room.
I'll shut these off.

855
00:51:28,147 --> 00:51:32,516
- There. Is that better?
- No. Turn that off.

856
00:51:32,585 --> 00:51:35,315
You used to like making love
with the lights on.

857
00:51:35,387 --> 00:51:38,948
Or in a sunny room in front of mirrors.
Remember?

858
00:51:39,024 --> 00:51:43,393
- Can we start with the lights off?
- Okay. Not a problem.

859
00:51:44,864 --> 00:51:47,264
There we go. How's that?

860
00:51:47,333 --> 00:51:49,699
Thank you.

861
00:51:49,768 --> 00:51:53,431
Come here.
You know how sexy you are?

Here... let's take off your sweatshirt.

863

I'll take my pants off here.

[Amanda:] Christ!
[Falk:] I'm sorry.

866
00:52:05,050 --> 00:52:10,215
I had all this change from the movie house
when I bought your popcorn.

867
00:52:10,289 --> 00:52:13,656
I can't do this.
The moment's ruined.

868
00:52:13,726 --> 00:52:16,490
That's crazy.
It shouldn't be that delicate.

869

It's not about should!
Look, I'm a wreck!

Okay, I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, but I can't.
I can't do this.

We'll start again, okay?
Lt'll be fine. A clean slate, okay?

00:52:29,241 --> 00:52:32,142
We got this room.
Let's take advantage.

- Your left breast?

and my sleeping pills.

906
00:54:24,923 --> 00:54:26,584
But they have opposite effects.

907

I don't take them all
on the same day.

Breathe in.

Hold. Let it go.

910

Why do you use diet pills?

911

I have some trouble
with my weight.

912

You're not overweight.
You have a lovely figure.

Lean back.
This doesn't hurt, does it?

No.

than I've had in 6 months!

Suppose we continue
at our next meeting.

923
00:55:14,773 --> 00:55:17,640
Mr. Falk, I would like to say that

924
00:55:17,709 --> 00:55:21,611
I will stop treating you if you
insist on keeping that rifle.

925
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:25,081
- What? Why?
- I think it's an acting out.

926
00:55:25,150 --> 00:55:28,085
And it's more to your advantage
to talk about it than act out.

927
00:55:28,153 --> 00:55:31,247
But Dobel thinks in the end,
we can only count on ourselves.

928
00:55:31,322 --> 00:55:33,688
I'm afraid our time is up.

929
00:55:33,758 --> 00:55:37,285
If you don't get rid of the rifle,
I can't continue the analysis.

- Jerry!
- Hey, Bill. How are you?

931

I'm good.
So, what are you doing here?

932
00:55:49,507 --> 00:55:52,067
I'm having lunch
with my manager, inside.

933

I saw him go in.

Nobody understands
why you don't lose him.

- Lose Harvey?
- The guy is a joke in the business.

- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

938

I'm telling you this as a friend.
You're starting to happen a little bit.

939

You don't need a character
like this representing you.

Thanks. I'll certainly think about it.

- Amanda? She's good.

She's studying
acting and singing.

No big deal.
I'll get it out of the way

My game plan for you
is going perfectly.

You don't have to read it now.

It's not that complicated.
It's the same thing,

- We could rent a car and drive out tonight.
- Tonight?

1057
01:03:00,803 --> 01:03:04,330
Connie? You should come, too.
You should bring Doug.

1058
01:03:04,406 --> 01:03:05,668
- Who's Doug?
- Go where?

1059
01:03:05,741 --> 01:03:09,336
My buddy lives in Montauk.
We're going there tonight.

1060
01:03:09,411 --> 01:03:13,472
- At this hour, there's no traffic.
- Montauk? It's midnight.

1061
01:03:13,549 --> 01:03:16,780
Montauk at midnight?
What could be more romantic?

1062
01:03:16,852 --> 01:03:18,752
- I can't.
- Me either.

1063
01:03:18,821 --> 01:03:21,483
- It's just too late.
- I have to get up early.

1064
01:03:21,557 --> 01:03:24,253
You know I work best
in the morning.

1065
01:03:24,326 --> 01:03:27,227
But we'll walk on the beach,
maybe take a swim.

1066
01:03:27,296 --> 01:03:29,230
Ray'll play his guitar.

1067
01:03:29,298 --> 01:03:31,198
- You play guitar?
- Yeah.

1068
01:03:31,266 --> 01:03:33,097
I'd rather eat rat poison

1069
01:03:33,168 --> 01:03:36,934
than watch this guy
play guitar on the beach at 3 AM.

1070
01:03:39,708 --> 01:03:42,040
- [Falk:] You're so quiet.
- [Amanda:] So are you.

1071
01:03:42,110 --> 01:03:44,305
- [Falk:] What's wrong?
- [Amanda:] Nothing.

1072
01:03:44,379 --> 01:03:47,815
[Falk:] Don't say, "nothing."
Obviously, you're upset.

1073
01:03:47,883 --> 01:03:51,478
Are you crushed because we didn't drive
100 miles to look at theater posters

1074
01:03:51,553 --> 01:03:53,748
and hear this guy play his guitar?

1075
01:03:53,822 --> 01:03:55,881
Shhh!
My mother's sleeping.

1076
01:03:55,958 --> 01:03:58,324
That road company James Dean
looked at you

1077
01:03:58,393 --> 01:04:01,487
like you were
a freshly baked cannoli.

1078
01:04:01,563 --> 01:04:03,758
Are you in love with Connie?

1079
01:04:03,832 --> 01:04:05,129
Connie?

1080
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:07,430
Don't pretend you can't
remember her name.

1081
01:04:07,503 --> 01:04:12,463
I wouldn't have even looked at Connie
if you hadn't thrown us together.

1082
01:04:12,541 --> 01:04:14,509
I thought you'd like her.

1083
01:04:14,576 --> 01:04:18,103
She's smart and beautiful
and very literate.

1084
01:04:18,180 --> 01:04:22,776
A literate actress?
What, is that like a four-leaf clover?

1085
01:04:22,851 --> 01:04:24,978
Most men find her seductive.

1086
01:04:25,053 --> 01:04:28,955
If you wanted to go off with Ray Polito,
you should have gone.

1087
01:04:29,024 --> 01:04:31,254
You didn't need to
fix me up with someone.

1088
01:04:31,326 --> 01:04:35,695
Please! I thought you'd want to see
his friend's theater posters.

1089
01:04:35,764 --> 01:04:39,393
I have no interest in Connie.
None. Nada.

1090
01:04:39,468 --> 01:04:43,564
You can sleep with other women.
Just don't throw it in my face.

1091
01:04:43,639 --> 01:04:46,802
I'm not sleeping with her!
Do you want to sleep with Ray?

1092
01:04:46,875 --> 01:04:50,311
[Paula:] Jesus Christ!
Will you two keep it down?

1093
01:04:50,379 --> 01:04:52,643
I can't sleep.
You got any pills?

1094
01:04:52,714 --> 01:04:56,548
I'm sorry, Mother.
I can't have these late-night discussions.

1095
01:04:56,618 --> 01:05:00,452
- I need a sleeping pill.
- Jerry? Come here.

1096
01:05:00,522 --> 01:05:02,752
- I want to show you something.
- Now? It's 2 AM.

1097
01:05:02,824 --> 01:05:06,453
Come here! Jerry.

1098
01:05:06,528 --> 01:05:11,488
This goddamn ballad is driving me crazy.
Just tell me what you think.

If life is meaningless,
then why choose to live?

1126
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:02,742
Dobel says we don't choose,
our blood chooses for us.

What does it all add up to if I die?

1128
01:07:05,647 --> 01:07:08,548
Freud says sex and work.

1129
01:07:08,617 --> 01:07:12,178
Dobel says work
gives the illusion of meaning,

1130
01:07:12,254 --> 01:07:15,587
and sex gives
the illusion of continuity.

[Paula singing]

She's going to practice now?

1133
01:07:21,496 --> 01:07:26,433
Hey, Paula? I'm trying to clarify
some ideas for my novel.

1134
01:07:26,501 --> 01:07:27,490
I just need...

1135
01:07:27,569 --> 01:07:30,629
I have some ideas for dialogue
leading to the Judy Garland medley.

1136
01:07:30,706 --> 01:07:33,106
Could we talk about it later?

1137
01:07:33,175 --> 01:07:37,874
I am so nervous. I don't know why
I'm so scared of performing.

1138
01:07:37,946 --> 01:07:41,074
- Where does Amanda keep her Valium?
- There. I'll get you one.

1139
01:07:41,149 --> 01:07:45,711
I just need a little bit of quiet,
just for the morning. Okay, Paula?

1140
01:08:01,636 --> 01:08:06,039
[Falk:] I went to the bathroom
to get her mother a Valium.

1141
01:08:06,108 --> 01:08:09,100
Because Dobel made me
so damn suspicious,

1142
01:08:09,177 --> 01:08:13,409
I couldn't resist the impulse
to open her diaphragm case

1143
01:08:13,482 --> 01:08:15,882
to see if it was there,
and it wasn't.

1144
01:08:17,652 --> 01:08:20,314
Why does she need her diaphragm?
What for?

1145
01:08:22,591 --> 01:08:24,354
And what's wrong with me?

1146
01:08:24,426 --> 01:08:28,658
Why should the thought
of Amanda sleeping with someone

1147
01:08:28,730 --> 01:08:31,221
be both excruciating and exciting?

1148
01:08:31,299 --> 01:08:33,824
I feel like committing suicide,

1149
01:08:33,902 --> 01:08:36,928
but I have so many problems,
that wouldn't solve them all.

1150
01:08:37,005 --> 01:08:39,974
What should I do?
What would you do?

1151
01:08:40,041 --> 01:08:42,908
Huh?
What do I do?

1152
01:08:42,978 --> 01:08:45,970
If it was me, Falk,
I would follow her.

1153
01:08:46,047 --> 01:08:48,413
Why do you put these paranoid thoughts
in my head?

1154
01:08:48,483 --> 01:08:51,941
Why does she wear a diaphragm?
Why isn't she on the pill?

1155
01:08:52,020 --> 01:08:55,786
It's hormonal.
The pill makes her crazy.

1156
01:08:55,857 --> 01:08:58,917
The pill makes her crazy?
Falk, she is crazy!

1157
01:08:58,994 --> 01:09:02,259
The Pentagon should use her hormones
for chemical warfare!

1158
01:09:02,330 --> 01:09:06,027
I don't get it. Where is it?
Where is her diaphragm?

1159
01:09:06,101 --> 01:09:08,160
Well, you know, I can imagine.

1160
01:09:08,236 --> 01:09:10,636
I've never followed anyone.

1161
01:09:10,705 --> 01:09:13,071
It's not rocket science, Falk.

1162
01:09:13,141 --> 01:09:16,975
The trick is not to be seen.
Where is she now?

1163
01:09:17,045 --> 01:09:18,808
- Acting class.
- You think.

1164
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:23,010
Christ, don't say that.
Of course she's at acting class.

1165
01:09:23,084 --> 01:09:26,178
She wouldn't miss that.
It's too crucial.

1166
01:09:26,254 --> 01:09:30,588
And that's where she sees
her acting partner, Ray Polito.

1167
01:09:30,658 --> 01:09:35,027
Look, I'm not good at following.
Why don't you come with me?

1168
01:09:35,096 --> 01:09:37,997
I can't.
I promised students I'd take them

1169
01:09:38,066 --> 01:09:41,729
to the Caravaggio exhibit
at the Metropolitan Museum.

1170
01:09:41,803 --> 01:09:43,771
I give them a little culture now and then

1171
01:09:43,838 --> 01:09:47,103
so they don't beat each other to death
with bicycle chains.

1172
01:09:47,175 --> 01:09:50,144
I'm too nervous to follow her.

1173
01:09:50,211 --> 01:09:52,509
There's nothing to it, you know.

1174
01:09:52,580 --> 01:09:57,313
You're worried about what you're
going to find, that's all.

1175
01:09:57,385 --> 01:09:59,615
You are a writer.
You have a gift.

1176
01:09:59,687 --> 01:10:05,523
You should have a girlfriend
who helps you and is encouraging,

1177
01:10:05,593 --> 01:10:10,223
not some mercurial little jitterbug
who'll have you hold up filling stations

1178
01:10:10,298 --> 01:10:14,166
- to keep her in mood elevators.
- I shouldn't have looked.

1179
01:10:14,235 --> 01:10:16,726
What you don't know will kill you!

1180
01:10:16,805 --> 01:10:19,797
What you don't know won't hurt you,
it'll kill you.

1181
01:10:19,874 --> 01:10:22,968
Like if they tell you
you're going to showers

1182
01:10:23,044 --> 01:10:25,842
but they turn out not to be showers.

1183
01:11:00,982 --> 01:11:04,076
Ray Polito.
I knew it.

1184
01:11:48,096 --> 01:11:51,759
[Amanda:] Where were you?
We have theater tickets tonight.

1185
01:11:51,833 --> 01:11:55,234
Paula, could you excuse us?
I have to talk to Amanda.

1186
01:11:55,303 --> 01:11:58,329
My God, Jerry.
Has the president been shot?

1187
01:11:58,406 --> 01:12:00,499
Fine with me.
I have a date tonight.

1188
01:12:00,575 --> 01:12:04,011
[Amanda:] What? You have a date?
With who?

1189
01:12:04,078 --> 01:12:07,275
I must confess.
It's with a guy who picked me up.

1190
01:12:07,348 --> 01:12:09,714
- Where?
- At my AA meeting.

1191
01:12:09,784 --> 01:12:12,844
- Great. An alcoholic.
- He's not an alcoholic.

1192
01:12:12,921 --> 01:12:14,980
He's the alcoholic's friend, the enabler.

1193
01:12:15,056 --> 01:12:17,388
Even better.
What does he do?

1194
01:12:17,458 --> 01:12:21,019
- He's a horse whisperer.
- What are you talking about?

1195
01:12:21,095 --> 01:12:23,256
- What are you looking for, your keys?
- Yes.

1196
01:12:23,331 --> 01:12:26,129
- They're over here.
- He's 26 years old.

1197
01:12:26,201 --> 01:12:30,467
Fabulous. You're going out
with a 26-year-old horse whisperer.

1198
01:12:30,538 --> 01:12:32,802
- [Falk:] Amanda, could I talk to you?
- Hold on!

1199
01:12:32,874 --> 01:12:37,140
- Would you really care if I got a tattoo?
- Yes.

1200
01:12:37,212 --> 01:12:38,941
- We'll discuss it later.
- No, Mom.

1201
01:12:39,013 --> 01:12:41,811
- We'll discuss it.
- Mom, don't.

1202
01:12:41,883 --> 01:12:44,351
Mom, your keys.
Your keys.

1203
01:12:44,419 --> 01:12:47,911
- Thanks.
- Jesus, you're so crazy!

1204
01:12:47,989 --> 01:12:50,116
- Where were you today?
- Acting class.

1205
01:12:50,191 --> 01:12:51,988
No, I mean after.

1206
01:12:52,060 --> 01:12:55,325
At a girlfriend's apartment,
rehearsing a scene.

1207
01:12:55,396 --> 01:12:57,694
No. No, you weren't

1208
01:12:57,765 --> 01:13:02,099
because I know you were in
the school building with your teacher.

1209
01:13:02,170 --> 01:13:04,400
That's right. I saw you.

1210
01:13:04,472 --> 01:13:07,407
- How?
- I was spying on you.

1211
01:13:07,475 --> 01:13:10,876
- Spying?
- That's right. I saw the three of you.

1212
01:13:10,945 --> 01:13:14,711
You, your acting teacher
and your diaphragm.

1213
01:13:14,782 --> 01:13:18,513
Your diaphragm. It's not here,
so where could it be?

1214
01:13:18,586 --> 01:13:22,147
There's no such thing
as a diaphragm repair shop.

1215
01:13:22,223 --> 01:13:25,124
I was there, Amanda.
I saw it all.

1216
01:13:25,193 --> 01:13:28,321
Okay. Okay, I slept with Ron Keller.

1217
01:13:28,396 --> 01:13:31,297
But I didn't do it
because I care about him.

1218
01:13:31,366 --> 01:13:34,767
No? What then?
To punish him?

1219
01:13:34,836 --> 01:13:39,102
I had to find out
if something was wrong with me.

1220
01:13:39,173 --> 01:13:43,234
I can't sleep with you,
the person that I love.

1221
01:13:43,311 --> 01:13:48,010
I had to know if I was
some kind of freak, or frigid.

1222
01:13:48,082 --> 01:13:52,917
I had to know if I could even get
aroused anymore and have an orgasm!

1223
01:13:52,987 --> 01:13:55,182
And can you?

1224
01:13:55,256 --> 01:13:57,622
Yeah. It's good news.
I can!

1225
01:13:57,692 --> 01:14:00,855
Okay. I want out of this relationship.

1226
01:14:00,928 --> 01:14:04,921
Jerry, don't say that.
You know I need you.

1227
01:14:04,999 --> 01:14:06,990
Need me? How can you need me

1228
01:14:07,068 --> 01:14:11,596
when all these positive feelings
happen with everyone but me?

1229
01:14:11,673 --> 01:14:15,165
Not everybody.
Just Ron Keller.

1230
01:14:15,243 --> 01:14:18,007
He reminds me of my father.

1231
01:14:18,079 --> 01:14:20,138
I remind you of your father.

1232
01:14:20,214 --> 01:14:23,775
You remind me of the good parts.
He reminds me of the bad.

1233
01:14:23,851 --> 01:14:26,479
I figured I should try everything.

1234
01:14:26,554 --> 01:14:29,387
You know, to figure out
what the problem is.

1235
01:14:29,457 --> 01:14:33,154
How did I get to be the good father?
What am I, Kris Kringle?

1236
01:14:33,227 --> 01:14:38,164
It is a maddening problem.
We had to try every kind of foreplay.

1237
01:14:38,232 --> 01:14:41,599
Where's the rifle?
I'm going to blow my brains out.

1238
01:14:41,669 --> 01:14:45,833
Don't be so middle-class!
I did it as much for you as for me.

1239
01:14:45,907 --> 01:14:51,277
Oh, thank you. For me?
Thank you so much for thinking of me.

1240
01:14:51,346 --> 01:14:53,371
Well, it worked.

1241
01:14:53,448 --> 01:14:57,316
Now I know that I can get excited.
Very excited.

1242
01:14:57,385 --> 01:15:00,513
Passionate!
I can have orgasms.

1243
01:15:00,588 --> 01:15:03,523
Like the ones I had
when we first started dating.

1244
01:15:03,591 --> 01:15:07,152
You know? Multiple ones,
where I claw the walls.

1245
01:15:07,228 --> 01:15:09,788
I'm so happy to hear this, Amanda!
Really.

1246
01:15:09,864 --> 01:15:12,560
This is just music to my ears.

1247
01:15:12,633 --> 01:15:16,797
I don't need the rifle.
I'll just hemorrhage here on the carpet.

1248
01:15:16,871 --> 01:15:20,238
Jerry, don't be mad.

1249
01:15:20,308 --> 01:15:23,471
And don't be mad at Ron.
He was just trying to help.

1250
01:15:23,544 --> 01:15:27,207
Ron? How could I be upset at Ron?

1251
01:15:27,281 --> 01:15:30,512
In fact, I'll put him
on my Christmas list,

1252
01:15:30,585 --> 01:15:33,349
if I can figure out
how to make a letter bomb.

1253
01:15:33,421 --> 01:15:36,948
Jerry...
Jerry, please.

1254
01:15:37,024 --> 01:15:41,518
[Sniffles] Please.
You know I love you so much.

1255
01:15:41,596 --> 01:15:44,565
I need you.
I can't live without you.

1256
01:15:44,632 --> 01:15:47,362
Jerry, please?

1257
01:15:47,435 --> 01:15:51,565
That's bullshit, Falk.
I don't buy any of it.

1258
01:15:51,639 --> 01:15:53,869
She says she did it therapeutically.

1259
01:15:53,941 --> 01:15:57,877
That's the kind of therapy they advertise
on the back of the Village Voice.

1260
01:15:57,945 --> 01:16:01,506
She wanted to make sure
she could still become aroused.

1261
01:16:01,582 --> 01:16:05,746
Well, I'm glad to hear
the little sweetheart can still...

1262
01:16:05,820 --> 01:16:10,052
You know, it's not in vlno verltas.

1263
01:16:10,124 --> 01:16:13,287
It's in eros verltas.

1264
01:16:13,361 --> 01:16:17,297
I don't know what to do, Dobel.
I'm totally confused.

1265
01:16:17,365 --> 01:16:21,096
You said it. You're afraid to sleep alone.
That's the whole story.

1266
01:16:21,169 --> 01:16:25,401
You surround yourself
with this farrago of baby-sitters,

1267
01:16:25,473 --> 01:16:30,604
this loving-disabled sex kitten
who's driving you crazy,

1268
01:16:30,678 --> 01:16:33,545
the Jew manager, you know?

1269
01:16:33,614 --> 01:16:37,243
Let me tell you,
I am of the Hebrew persuasion,

1270
01:16:37,318 --> 01:16:39,650
but that guy who handles you

1271
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:44,885
is a member of one of the lost tribes
of Israel that should have remained lost.

1272
01:16:44,959 --> 01:16:50,124
And you got this shrink who, like God,
never speaks and, like God, is dead.

1273
01:16:50,198 --> 01:16:56,501
There's nothing wrong with being afraid.
We were meant to be afraid.

1274
01:16:56,571 --> 01:17:00,439
That's why you have to build
a survival kit.

1275
01:17:00,508 --> 01:17:04,911
Do you have a little time now?
I want to chat with you.

1276
01:17:06,746 --> 01:17:10,842
It's just a joint,
but they have great Chinese food.

1277
01:17:10,917 --> 01:17:14,478
We're in luck.
There's a guy pulling out.

1278
01:17:17,123 --> 01:17:20,854
Let me speak to you about something.

1279
01:17:21,761 --> 01:17:27,358
I have an acquaintance
out in California who produces

1280
01:17:27,434 --> 01:17:30,028
and he's doing some
comedy shows on television.

1281
01:17:30,103 --> 01:17:33,561
I know they're looking
for teams of writers.

1282
01:17:33,640 --> 01:17:38,202
If I told them that you and I were a team,
I think we could get hired.

1283
01:17:38,278 --> 01:17:39,336
In California?

1284
01:17:39,412 --> 01:17:42,813
Yeah. All the action is out there.
It's not here.

1285
01:17:42,882 --> 01:17:44,782
I don't know what Amanda would say.

1286
01:17:44,851 --> 01:17:47,376
Though her mother's always wanted
to go to Hollywood.

1287
01:17:47,454 --> 01:17:51,823
Can I explain something?
I'm talking about a clean break.

1288
01:17:51,891 --> 01:17:56,123
Me with the Board of Education,
and you with everybody.

1289
01:17:56,196 --> 01:17:59,996
With that fish peddler,
garment center manager you have,

1290
01:18:00,066 --> 01:18:04,469
with your shrink and with that little girl
who gives you a hard time.

1291
01:18:04,537 --> 01:18:07,097
I can'tjust leave...
go by myself?

1292
01:18:07,173 --> 01:18:09,471
Not go by yourself. Go with me.

1293
01:18:09,542 --> 01:18:12,670
We'd go together so you can't
fall back on being alone.

1294
01:18:12,746 --> 01:18:15,010
I've given it a lot of thought, Falk,

1295
01:18:15,081 --> 01:18:19,643
and I know for me, it's now or never.

1296

Hey!

1299
01:18:40,707 --> 01:18:43,141
Hey, I was waiting
for this space for five minutes.

1300
01:18:43,209 --> 01:18:46,042
I was here for five minutes, waiting...

1301
01:18:46,112 --> 01:18:48,910
You got a problem with me parking here?

1302
01:18:48,982 --> 01:18:51,883
You been waiting? Too bad.
You slow, you blow.

- I'm a busy man. I have things to do.
- But I was...

What, are you high on crack
to be arguing with him?!

1305
01:18:58,358 --> 01:19:01,987
- I was waiting here for five minutes!
- You want to meet God?

1306
01:19:02,062 --> 01:19:03,996
Do you? Get out of here!

1307
01:19:04,064 --> 01:19:07,192
Go home, old man.
Do what the man says.

1308
01:19:07,267 --> 01:19:09,360
Go, before I kick you in the ass!

1309
01:19:09,436 --> 01:19:13,566
Get in your car and go home.
And you, turn around!

1310
01:19:14,574 --> 01:19:16,474
Idiots!

1311
01:19:20,847 --> 01:19:22,906
My God, Dobel.

1312
01:19:22,982 --> 01:19:25,849
Either one of those guys
could have beat you to a pulp.

1313
01:19:25,919 --> 01:19:28,513
Is it so important you insist?

1314
01:19:28,588 --> 01:19:30,715
Life's unfair.
You said it yourself.

1315

Those guys have the muscles
and we're blessed with wit.

1316
01:19:34,594 --> 01:19:38,496
Later on, in the quiet and safety
of some delicatessen,

1317
01:19:38,565 --> 01:19:42,524
we can write a biting satire
and expose all their foibles

1318
01:19:42,602 --> 01:19:46,003
and have a great, big laugh.

[Typing]

1331
01:20:48,835 --> 01:20:51,167
I had mixed feelings over the day.

1332
01:20:51,237 --> 01:20:55,799
On the one hand, I was convinced
Dobel was a raving, psychotic lunatic.

1333
01:20:55,875 --> 01:20:59,641
On the other hand, I had
a kind of odd admiration for him.

1334
01:20:59,712 --> 01:21:02,875
I would have just slinked away, bullied.
You know?

1335
01:21:02,949 --> 01:21:06,441
But he wouldn't let the injustice rest.
He resisted.

1336
01:21:06,519 --> 01:21:08,987
There are always some people
who will resist.

1337
01:21:09,055 --> 01:21:12,821
And, as he says,
the issue is always fascism.

He's nuts.

1339
01:21:45,992 --> 01:21:49,860
And yet the thought
of giving up everything here

1340
01:21:49,929 --> 01:21:55,595
and starting fresh in California,
it's so tempting and exhilarating.

1341
01:21:55,668 --> 01:21:59,434
Why do I get so scared?
Because I'm not a leaver.

The one time Amanda
and I broke up, she left me.

It all happened too fast.
I was overwhelmed by you.

1344

It was a whirlwind and right away,
we were living together!

1345

I think we'd both benefit
by some time apart.

I don't need time apart.

I know how to fool them.

1354
01:22:37,343 --> 01:22:42,212
Just all that talk about
how we were made for each other,

1355
01:22:42,282 --> 01:22:44,512
and marriage, I...

1356
01:22:46,252 --> 01:22:48,880
She moved out.
I was miserable.

1357
01:22:48,955 --> 01:22:52,482
Eating moo goo gai pan
out of boxes every night,

1358
01:22:52,558 --> 01:22:54,856
having dreams of death.

1359
01:22:54,927 --> 01:22:58,988
I tried dating, but it was hard
getting her out of my mind.

1360
01:23:03,803 --> 01:23:07,637
Why don't you come
to the ladies' room?

1361
01:23:07,707 --> 01:23:11,302
The door locks.
We can be alone.

1362
01:23:12,378 --> 01:23:17,077
The wine has put me, um,
very much in the mood.

1363
01:23:17,150 --> 01:23:22,782
Okay. I'll count to 30
and meet you in the ladies' room.

1364
01:23:22,855 --> 01:23:24,789
Meet me where?

1365
01:23:24,857 --> 01:23:27,052
I'm sorry.

1366
01:23:27,126 --> 01:23:30,653
My mind was somewhere else.

1367
01:23:30,730 --> 01:23:34,222
<i>[</i>Falk.<i>:]</i> Then, a few weeks later,
just as suddenly as she moved out,

1368
01:23:34,300 --> 01:23:35,460
Amanda returned.

1369
01:23:35,535 --> 01:23:39,665
[Amanda:] I'm back.
But if you don't want me, I understand.

1370
01:23:39,739 --> 01:23:41,730
You're back?

1371
01:23:41,808 --> 01:23:47,542
I couldn't be without you.
I tried, but I just couldn't.

1372
01:23:47,613 --> 01:23:51,913
You didn't move in with
your girlfriend April, like you said.

1373
01:23:51,984 --> 01:23:56,284
I found out you went to Naples
with Tony Hanken.

1374
01:23:56,356 --> 01:23:58,187
Well, you can understand.

1375
01:23:58,257 --> 01:24:01,488
He wanted me to go with him
to Naples and Rome.

1376
01:24:01,561 --> 01:24:03,927
It sounded so romantic.

1377
01:24:03,996 --> 01:24:08,956
Those are places I've dreamed of.
I thought that's what I wanted.

1378
01:24:09,035 --> 01:24:11,868
But I missed you too much.

1379
01:24:11,938 --> 01:24:14,304
But of course you made love with him.

1380
01:24:14,374 --> 01:24:16,934
Yes, but I thought of you.

1381
01:24:17,009 --> 01:24:21,378
You were really the person I was
making love to in Naples and Florence

1382
01:24:21,447 --> 01:24:24,974
and Venice, on the airplane
40,000 feet in the air...

1383
01:24:25,051 --> 01:24:26,541
Okay. Enough.

1384
01:24:26,619 --> 01:24:29,782
Oh, yeah... and at the Vatican.

1385
01:24:29,856 --> 01:24:32,916
All I could think about
while we were doing it

1386
01:24:32,992 --> 01:24:36,155
was how much
you would love that ceiling.

1387
01:24:36,229 --> 01:24:40,256
So I'm back.
I'm home because...

1388
01:24:40,333 --> 01:24:43,860
I can't live without you.

1389
01:24:43,936 --> 01:24:48,134
<i>[</i>Falk.<i>:]</i> We made love that nlght.
It was wondertul.

1390
01:24:48,207 --> 01:24:51,574
If only certaln moments In llfe
could last,

1391
01:24:51,644 --> 01:24:55,341
just stay frozen,
llke some old vase.

1392
01:25:00,420 --> 01:25:03,184
[Typing]

1393
01:25:16,569 --> 01:25:18,833
[Door opens, woman laughing]

1394
01:25:21,340 --> 01:25:25,834
Paula, would you keep it down?
You're going to wake Amanda.

1395
01:25:25,912 --> 01:25:28,745
Jerry, you haven't met Ralph.
This is Ralph!

1396
01:25:28,815 --> 01:25:31,511
Can you keep it down?
Amanda's...

1397
01:25:31,584 --> 01:25:34,075
we saw Elaine Stritch
on Broadway tonight.

1398
01:25:34,153 --> 01:25:35,552
She was magnificent!

1399
01:25:35,621 --> 01:25:37,851
Unbelievable!
I wish I could do that!

1400
01:25:37,924 --> 01:25:39,357
- You can.
- I can.

1401
01:25:39,425 --> 01:25:41,393
I mean, I have a voice.

1402
01:25:41,461 --> 01:25:44,021
I just need some snappy dialogue
from you, Jerry.

1403
01:25:44,096 --> 01:25:48,226
Absolutely. I'm sorry.
I'm, uh...

1404
01:25:48,301 --> 01:25:51,327
[Paula:] Ralph, don't give me much.
I've never had cocaine before.

1405
01:25:51,404 --> 01:25:53,964
- Okay, just a little.
- Is that coc... what are you...

1406
01:25:54,040 --> 01:25:55,871
- Is that, uh...?
- It's blow.

1407
01:25:55,942 --> 01:26:00,743
Blow? What are you doing with blow?
And on my computer?

1408
01:26:00,813 --> 01:26:03,008
You're such a stick in the mud!

1409
01:26:03,082 --> 01:26:06,142
- You can partake.
- I'm not going to partake.

1410
01:26:06,219 --> 01:26:09,211
- What is going on?
- I said they'd wake you.

1411
01:26:09,288 --> 01:26:12,519
Mother, you know how
difficult it is for me to sleep.

1412
01:26:12,592 --> 01:26:14,753
I took two sleeping pills tonight.

1413
01:26:14,827 --> 01:26:18,319
We saw Elaine Stritch on Broadway.
You want some cocaine?

1414
01:26:18,397 --> 01:26:23,699
No, we don't want any cocaine, Amanda.

1415
01:26:23,769 --> 01:26:26,397
- I've never tried it.
- I've never tried lots of things!

1416
01:26:26,472 --> 01:26:29,407
- Bungee jumping, alligator wrestling.
- I'd have a little.

1417
01:26:29,475 --> 01:26:32,638
- You don't know what you're doing!
- No fears, Jerry.

1418
01:26:32,712 --> 01:26:34,543
Ralph knows exactly what he's doing.

1419
01:26:34,614 --> 01:26:38,710
- Nothing to worry about.
- Great. I won't be a part of this.

1420
01:26:38,784 --> 01:26:40,911
[Paula:] You are so goddamn prissy!

1421
01:26:40,987 --> 01:26:42,716
Thank you very much, Paula.

1422
01:26:42,788 --> 01:26:46,155
She has a point.
You're never up for anything.

1423
01:26:46,225 --> 01:26:49,456
I'm up for things that
you're not up for. Okay?

1424
01:26:49,529 --> 01:26:53,124
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

1425
01:26:53,199 --> 01:26:56,100
- [Snorting]
- I'm not going to snort cocaine, okay?

1426
01:26:56,168 --> 01:26:59,934
I'm a nice, square Jewish boy, okay?

1427
01:27:00,006 --> 01:27:03,305
I'm not putting anything up my nose.
My God, Paula!

1428
01:27:03,376 --> 01:27:05,901
- Are you kidding me?
- I don't know. I do it right?

1429
01:27:05,978 --> 01:27:08,572
Lt'll make you feel sexy, Jerry.

1430
01:27:08,648 --> 01:27:10,946
Does it?
Does it make you feel sexy?

1431
01:27:11,017 --> 01:27:14,214
- [Ralph:] Sexy.
- This could be interesting.

1432
01:27:14,287 --> 01:27:17,688
Some people it makes feel sexy.
Other it makes belligerent.

1433
01:27:17,757 --> 01:27:19,588
With my luck, you'll take a knife to me.

1434
01:27:19,659 --> 01:27:22,150
[Ralph:] Come on, just do a line!

1435
01:27:22,228 --> 01:27:25,925
You know what this does to your
nasal membranes? Eats them raw.

1436
01:27:25,998 --> 01:27:28,694
- Just do some with me.
- No!

1437
01:27:28,768 --> 01:27:32,135
Maybe it'll turn me on.

1438
01:27:32,204 --> 01:27:34,434
Darling, have a drink.

1439
01:27:34,507 --> 01:27:35,997
I have to talk to Dobel.

1440
01:27:36,075 --> 01:27:40,102
[Paula:] It's just a social thing.
It's not like we're drug addicts.

1441
01:27:40,179 --> 01:27:43,080
They snorted cocaine!
Can you believe that?

1442
01:27:43,149 --> 01:27:47,245
My mother fed me Cheerios.
She's giving her daughter coke!

1443
01:27:47,320 --> 01:27:51,347
By the way, it did not
solve our problem in bed.

1444
01:27:51,424 --> 01:27:55,690
I was not making eyes
at my mother's boyfriend.

1445
01:27:55,761 --> 01:27:58,662
God, you're so paranoid.

1446
01:27:58,731 --> 01:28:00,995
Why would I be interested
in a horse whisperer

1447
01:28:01,067 --> 01:28:06,300
who lives in Topanga Canyon
and has one of those giant SUVs

1448
01:28:06,372 --> 01:28:09,705
and stupid German Shepherds
and chain saws.

1449
01:28:09,775 --> 01:28:12,710
How do you know
so much about him?

1450
01:28:12,778 --> 01:28:16,908
Well, he was interesting to talk to.

1451
01:28:16,982 --> 01:28:22,443
So you're saying you're on the defensive
because you wouldn't snort cocaine?

1452
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:26,012
It's not the cocaine.
It's the principle.

1453
01:28:26,091 --> 01:28:29,083
- What principle?
- And, you know, she's not entirely wrong.

1454
01:28:29,160 --> 01:28:33,927
I mean, I am too rigid and disciplined.

1455
01:28:34,666 --> 01:28:38,397
- What is this?
- You don't want to know.

1456
01:28:38,470 --> 01:28:43,669
What is it, a monologue
for some alleged comedian

1457
01:28:43,742 --> 01:28:47,803
who thinks to be offensive
is in itself enough to be funny?

1458
01:28:47,879 --> 01:28:52,111
I wish it were.
I certainly can't write at home anymore.

1459
01:28:52,183 --> 01:28:56,415
- What is it?
- My contract extension with Harvey.

1460
01:28:57,122 --> 01:29:01,024
- Unsigned, of course.
- You don't understand, okay?

1461
01:29:01,092 --> 01:29:05,654
If I don't re-up with him,
he will truly die.

1462
01:29:05,730 --> 01:29:07,857
- He'll commit suicide.
- I understand.

1463
01:29:07,932 --> 01:29:10,457
No, I understand completely.

1464
01:29:10,535 --> 01:29:13,766
What are you doing?
Dobel, what the hell are you doing?!

1465
01:29:13,838 --> 01:29:16,602
- What is wrong with you?!
- Where are you meeting him?

1466
01:29:16,674 --> 01:29:18,403
What did you do?!

1467
01:29:18,476 --> 01:29:22,412
- At Isabella's. What did you do?
- Well, go in and tell him it's over.

1468
01:29:22,480 --> 01:29:26,678
Tell him you and I are going
to California to write as a team.

1469
01:29:26,751 --> 01:29:29,447
Are you insane?
Why did you tear this up?!

1470
01:29:29,521 --> 01:29:33,252
Because you're not spending
five more minutes with this guy,

1471
01:29:33,324 --> 01:29:36,225
much less seven years
with this fumbling vantz

1472
01:29:36,294 --> 01:29:38,592
who robs you blind with a sliding scale.

1473
01:29:38,663 --> 01:29:42,030
I can't tell him it's over, Dobel.
I cannot...

1474
01:29:42,100 --> 01:29:44,967
I'll go with you.
I'll sit in the place while you tell him.

1475
01:29:45,036 --> 01:29:47,834
I'll give you moral support.
And don't beat around the bush.

1476
01:29:47,906 --> 01:29:50,272
Once you tergiversate, you're lost.

1477
01:30:03,588 --> 01:30:06,250
I'm sorry I'm late.

1478
01:30:06,324 --> 01:30:09,384
My mom has this hyperactive thyroid.

1479
01:30:09,461 --> 01:30:13,261
Sorry.

1480
01:30:13,331 --> 01:30:15,231
I ran into Dick Mallory.

1481
01:30:15,300 --> 01:30:18,064
He's working with a comic
who needs material.

1482
01:30:18,136 --> 01:30:21,401
I naturally told him your price.

1483
01:30:21,473 --> 01:30:25,034
I said, you know, what you get.

1484
01:30:25,110 --> 01:30:28,045
The kid works dirty.
A lot of bathroom jokes.

1485
01:30:28,113 --> 01:30:32,447
I said, "Look, Jerry Falk is a professional.

1486
01:30:32,517 --> 01:30:38,217
"If what you need are bathroom jokes,
he can do them."

1487
01:30:38,289 --> 01:30:40,382
Harvey?

1488
01:30:40,458 --> 01:30:43,757
- What's wrong with your voice?
- We should talk.

1489
01:30:43,828 --> 01:30:46,126
Yeah. That's the way I am.

1490
01:30:46,197 --> 01:30:50,065
I always like to settle business
before the meal.

1491
01:30:50,135 --> 01:30:53,536
This way, you can relax
and enjoy lunch.

1492
01:30:53,605 --> 01:30:56,938
You brought the contract, right?

1493
01:30:57,842 --> 01:30:59,833
Harvey...

1494
01:30:59,911 --> 01:31:03,642
there's no question that you were there
for me from the start.

1495
01:31:03,715 --> 01:31:07,207
And if you think it's easy
selling an 18-year-old unknown...

1496
01:31:07,285 --> 01:31:09,719
it's a jungle out there.

1497
01:31:09,787 --> 01:31:13,621
And, and you've done
a very professional job.

1498
01:31:13,691 --> 01:31:17,627
And I've paid you...
I mean, the sliding scale.

1499
01:31:17,695 --> 01:31:21,153
You know, even though
it slid toward you.

1500
01:31:21,232 --> 01:31:24,565
Now... now I see myself

1501
01:31:24,636 --> 01:31:26,729
moving in a whole new direction.

1502
01:31:26,804 --> 01:31:28,499
Meaning?

1503
01:31:28,573 --> 01:31:32,669
Basically, I'm interested
in more serious things.

1504
01:31:32,744 --> 01:31:36,703
A novel, maybe some plays,
maybe not even comedy.

1505
01:31:38,616 --> 01:31:43,519
The dollars are in the jokes.
Funny is money.

1506
01:31:43,588 --> 01:31:48,082
I mean, you know, as a hobby,
later, when you're rich

1507
01:31:48,159 --> 01:31:51,788
someday, if you want to try a book... fine.

1508
01:31:51,863 --> 01:31:55,594
Although... the young kids are not readers.

1509
01:31:55,667 --> 01:31:57,464
Harvey...

1510
01:31:57,535 --> 01:32:00,197
What? You're all flushed.

1511
01:32:01,706 --> 01:32:04,607
I'm not going to re-sign with you.

1512
01:32:04,676 --> 01:32:06,109
What?

1513
01:32:06,177 --> 01:32:10,637
Now I know this may be a little,
uh, disappointing to you,

1514
01:32:10,715 --> 01:32:15,448
but I'm moving to California
and reevaluating my priorities.

1515
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:19,217
- You're what?
- I'm not going to need a manager.

1516
01:32:24,896 --> 01:32:26,921
You're not re-signing with me?

1517
01:32:26,998 --> 01:32:28,989
It's not the end of the world.

1518
01:32:29,067 --> 01:32:33,834
- You're dumping me?
- No, not dumping. I'm moving.

1519
01:32:33,905 --> 01:32:36,806
I'm changing my goals.
Don't take it badly.

1520
01:32:36,874 --> 01:32:40,275
No! My life...

1521
01:32:40,345 --> 01:32:44,577
My life is over.
You're not re-signing with me?!

1522
01:32:44,649 --> 01:32:46,514
Harvey, calm down.

1523
01:32:46,584 --> 01:32:50,020
But my future! My plans!

1524
01:32:50,088 --> 01:32:53,717
The humiliation!
You're dumping me!

1525
01:32:53,791 --> 01:32:55,588
You're overreacting.

1526
01:32:55,660 --> 01:32:58,754
You ungrateful,

1527
01:32:58,830 --> 01:33:02,766
phony, two-timing...
you louse!

1528
01:33:02,834 --> 01:33:05,302
Folks, this is not what you think.

1529
01:33:05,370 --> 01:33:08,931
- I've invested all my dreams in you!
- I'm leaving town.

1530
01:33:09,007 --> 01:33:11,703
- What have I done wrong?!
- Nothing.

1531
01:33:11,776 --> 01:33:14,108
- How have I failed you?!
- You've been great.

1532
01:33:14,178 --> 01:33:15,873
Can we discuss this elsewhere?

1533
01:33:15,947 --> 01:33:20,384
This is the loyalty I get
for years of struggle?!

1534
01:33:20,451 --> 01:33:23,113
Harvey, not everybody
signs every contract for life.

1535
01:33:23,187 --> 01:33:28,215
The room is turning black!
Turning black!

1536
01:33:28,293 --> 01:33:30,784
Air! Air!

1537
01:33:34,599 --> 01:33:36,897
Dobel! Dobel!

1538
01:33:36,968 --> 01:33:39,960
He's firing me!
This is the payoff I get!

1539
01:33:40,038 --> 01:33:42,302
- I'm out!
- He's taking it badly.

1540
01:33:42,373 --> 01:33:45,365
- Pains in my chest!
- Can we get some brandy for him?

1541
01:33:45,443 --> 01:33:48,241
Please reconsider.
Tell him to reconsider.

1542
01:33:48,313 --> 01:33:50,406
I'll go home and think about it.

1543
01:33:50,481 --> 01:33:54,281
Listen to me!
He's not reconsidering.

1544
01:33:54,352 --> 01:33:56,718
He's moving on.
Get on with your life.

1545
01:33:56,788 --> 01:33:58,915
[People gasping]

1546
01:34:00,958 --> 01:34:02,789
Everybody, stand back.
Relax.

1547
01:34:02,860 --> 01:34:04,691
Oh, my God!

1548
01:34:04,762 --> 01:34:06,957
[Dobel:] There seems to be
a pulse beat here.

1549
01:34:07,031 --> 01:34:09,727
- [Falk:] What have I done?
- We should get an ambulance.

1550
01:34:09,801 --> 01:34:12,565
An ambulance? What have I done?
Oh, my God!

1551
01:34:12,637 --> 01:34:15,037
Relax. The paramedics
will pound on the chest.

1552
01:34:15,106 --> 01:34:18,303
I killed him!
I shouldn't have listened to you.

1553
01:34:18,376 --> 01:34:23,040
Sometimes the victim comes back.
You don't need a manager.

1554
01:34:23,114 --> 01:34:25,639
Well, maybe not,
but I don't need him to die.

1555
01:34:25,717 --> 01:34:30,279
Relax! If he dies because
you don't sign a contract with him,

1556
01:34:30,355 --> 01:34:33,119
then you should have
nothing to do with him.

1557
01:34:33,191 --> 01:34:34,658
Harvey?

1558
01:34:35,727 --> 01:34:40,596
<i>[</i>Falk.<i>:]</i> Harvey dld not dle.
As Dobel predlcted, he survlved.

1559
01:34:40,665 --> 01:34:43,725
I walked around In the clty,
trylng to get my thoughts In order.

1560
01:34:43,801 --> 01:34:48,067
Whenever I'm unsure or troubled,
I take to the clty streets.

1561
01:34:48,139 --> 01:34:50,300
Walklng In New York clears my head.

1562
01:34:50,375 --> 01:34:52,468
I couldn't deny lt.

1563
01:34:52,543 --> 01:34:56,104
There was a feellng of freedom,
of exhllaratlon.

1564
01:34:56,180 --> 01:34:57,909
[Falk:] Hey!

1565
01:34:57,982 --> 01:34:59,916
- Hi!
- Hey.

1566
01:34:59,984 --> 01:35:01,918
Jerry, you remember Connie.

1567
01:35:01,986 --> 01:35:05,114
- Connie, nice to see you.
- I invited her for dinner.

1568
01:35:05,189 --> 01:35:07,521
- You're cooking?
- Yes.

1569
01:35:07,592 --> 01:35:10,060
I'm making spaghetti.

1570
01:35:10,128 --> 01:35:12,528
He makes fun of me
because I only know how

1571
01:35:12,597 --> 01:35:14,827
to make spaghetti for eight people.

1572
01:35:14,899 --> 01:35:17,993
I can't change
the recipe proportionally.

1573
01:35:18,069 --> 01:35:21,698
So tonight we'll be having
five extra portions.

1574
01:35:21,773 --> 01:35:25,709
[Falk:] I have news!
I've parted ways with Harvey.

1575
01:35:25,777 --> 01:35:27,802
Oh.

1576
01:35:27,879 --> 01:35:29,779
The spaghetti for eight is terrific.

1577
01:35:29,847 --> 01:35:31,576
Let me explain what happened.

1578
01:35:31,649 --> 01:35:34,482
There I am, having a nice time,
a little drunk.

1579
01:35:34,552 --> 01:35:38,454
I have two drinks and I'm ready
to hold up a Brink's truck.

1580
01:35:38,523 --> 01:35:43,358
I start to see what it is about Connie
that Amanda had raved about.

1581
01:35:43,428 --> 01:35:47,262
She was very charming
and pretty and smart.

1582
01:35:47,331 --> 01:35:52,064
I started to get the feeling
that she was finding me engaging.

1583
01:35:52,136 --> 01:35:55,902
I've never found conventionally
handsome men attractive.

1584
01:35:55,973 --> 01:35:58,874
I much prefer faces with character.

1585
01:35:58,943 --> 01:36:03,846
I've fallen for some pretty
odd-looking men in my life.

1586
01:36:03,915 --> 01:36:08,375
<i>[</i>Falk.<i>:]</i> After dlnner, I found myself
alone In the kltchen wlth Connle

1587
01:36:08,453 --> 01:36:10,512
and wantlng to touch her.

1588
01:36:10,588 --> 01:36:14,752
I say thls because It was the flrst tlme
slnce meetlng Amanda

1589
01:36:14,826 --> 01:36:16,919
I'd even looked at another woman.

1590
01:36:16,994 --> 01:36:21,124
And I began to feel that
maybe the tlme had come for me

1591
01:36:21,199 --> 01:36:24,896
to pack up and start over
In Callfornla wlth Dobel.

1592
01:36:24,969 --> 01:36:28,837
I'm terminating our sessions and
moving to California with Dobel.

1593
01:36:28,906 --> 01:36:31,101
There's a job waiting for us.

1594
01:36:31,175 --> 01:36:35,009
I'll miss New York,
but if I can accumulate enough money,

1595
01:36:35,079 --> 01:36:38,913
I can return and work on
my own projects.

1596
01:36:38,983 --> 01:36:41,713
What do you think about my decision?

1597
01:36:41,786 --> 01:36:44,653
What do you think about it?

1598
01:36:47,792 --> 01:36:52,024
I told them I'm leaving.
I gave notice and I won't starve.

1599
01:36:52,096 --> 01:36:55,327
I've saved some money.
The thing I'll miss most is the kids.

1600
01:36:55,399 --> 01:36:58,266
The kids are wonderful. Bright.

1601
01:36:58,336 --> 01:37:00,964
You should see the creative ways

1602
01:37:01,038 --> 01:37:04,804
they smuggle weapons
past the metal detectors. It's amazing.

1603
01:37:04,876 --> 01:37:06,844
- Now you have to tell Amanda.
- I know.

1604
01:37:06,911 --> 01:37:08,344
And don't tergiversate.

1605
01:37:08,412 --> 01:37:12,075
Did I tergiversate with Harvey?
Huh? No.

1606
01:37:12,149 --> 01:37:14,242
I don't even know what the hell
"tergiversate" means,

1607
01:37:14,318 --> 01:37:17,412
so how can I tergiversate?

1608
01:37:17,488 --> 01:37:19,217
Ahh, she'll die.

1609
01:37:21,192 --> 01:37:25,424
Amanda?
Amanda, I want to talk with you.

1610
01:37:25,496 --> 01:37:26,724
- Hi.
- Hi.

1611
01:37:26,798 --> 01:37:29,892
- I want to talk about something.
- I need to talk to you, too.

1612
01:37:29,967 --> 01:37:33,698
I think I should go first,
'cause it's pretty serious.

1613
01:37:33,771 --> 01:37:36,569
Me, too.

1614
01:37:36,641 --> 01:37:40,668
- Can we sit down?
- Yeah, I think we should sit.

1615
01:37:44,982 --> 01:37:47,542
- I'm moving to Los Angeles.
- I'm moving out.

1616
01:37:47,618 --> 01:37:49,313
What?

1617
01:37:49,387 --> 01:37:52,049
I want to be totally honest
with you, Jerry.

1618
01:37:52,123 --> 01:37:56,025
I've met someone and developed
very strong feelings for him.

1619
01:37:56,094 --> 01:37:59,029
- You met someone?
- Yes.

1620
01:37:59,097 --> 01:38:02,692
- Have you been having an affair?
- No, and I don't want to.

1621
01:38:02,767 --> 01:38:05,895
I can't do all that lying
and sneaking around.

1622
01:38:05,970 --> 01:38:08,734
- Well, where did you meet him?
- In passing.

1623
01:38:08,806 --> 01:38:12,674
You must have spent time with him
to have feelings for him.

1624
01:38:12,744 --> 01:38:16,578
We've had a few drinks, nothing heavy.
Just a few chats.

1625
01:38:16,647 --> 01:38:18,638
So you have been seeing someone.

1626
01:38:18,716 --> 01:38:21,412
I've had a couple
of casual conversations.

1627
01:38:21,486 --> 01:38:23,044
You slept with him?

1628
01:38:23,121 --> 01:38:25,555
My God, Jerry.
What do you think I am?

1629
01:38:25,623 --> 01:38:29,423
- Have you?
- Once. And very quickly.

1630
01:38:29,494 --> 01:38:32,122
I had to see if we were
sexually compatible.

1631
01:38:32,196 --> 01:38:35,063
I refused to let myself have an affair.

1632
01:38:35,133 --> 01:38:39,160
That's why I'm being so honest.
I want to be straightforward.

1633
01:38:39,237 --> 01:38:44,607
I'm at a loss for words.
I, uh, I...

1634
01:38:44,675 --> 01:38:48,008
I don't know what to say.
I'm completely taken aback.

1635
01:38:48,079 --> 01:38:51,981
I'll be moving out.
Everything will be clean and honest.

1636
01:38:52,049 --> 01:38:55,382
Mom will stay here
till Phil and I get settled.

1637
01:38:55,453 --> 01:38:57,648
- Phil?
- It'll only be a month,

1638
01:38:57,722 --> 01:39:00,020
until Phil's divorce comes through.

1639
01:39:00,091 --> 01:39:05,393
No. Your mother's not staying here.
I said I'm moving to California.

1640
01:39:05,463 --> 01:39:08,557
- I won't be here.
- That's so great!

1641
01:39:08,633 --> 01:39:10,225
Did you get a job out there?

1642
01:39:10,301 --> 01:39:15,034
Yes. Dobel and I, on a TV show.

1643
01:39:15,106 --> 01:39:18,542
That's wonderful.
You'll knock 'em dead out there.

1644
01:39:18,609 --> 01:39:23,876
Idiots who are total losers in New York
go to L.A. And become millionaires.

1645
01:39:23,948 --> 01:39:26,610
God, this is so much better this way.

1646
01:39:26,684 --> 01:39:29,881
It was unfair, the way we were living,

1647
01:39:29,954 --> 01:39:34,948
you having to put up with my stupid
inability to function sexually

1648
01:39:35,026 --> 01:39:38,518
and me hating myself all the time.

1649
01:39:39,197 --> 01:39:43,031
This is sad, but it's for the best.

1650
01:39:44,802 --> 01:39:48,829
You know what would be
kind of romantic?

1651
01:39:48,906 --> 01:39:52,307
If we were to make love,
just one last time.

1652
01:39:52,376 --> 01:39:55,539
- For old times' sake.
- I thought you couldn't.

1653
01:39:55,613 --> 01:39:59,811
Everything's different now.
The psychodynamic has changed.

1654
01:40:00,885 --> 01:40:04,548
Who knows?
Maybe we'll end up having an affair.

1655
01:40:11,662 --> 01:40:15,393
[Falk:] I did it! I did it.
I cut all the ties.

1656
01:40:15,465 --> 01:40:17,729
I feel free and exhilarated

1657
01:40:17,801 --> 01:40:20,929
like I'm falling through space.

1658
01:40:21,004 --> 01:40:23,734
I feel confident
and I'm very positive,

1659
01:40:23,807 --> 01:40:27,470
but also like I'm buried alive.
I don't know.

1660
01:40:27,544 --> 01:40:30,104
I'm sure once we get to L.A.
And start working...

1661
01:40:30,180 --> 01:40:33,172
Speaking of which,
I just bought some luggage.

1662
01:40:33,250 --> 01:40:37,050
What's wrong?
You sound all weird.

1663
01:40:37,120 --> 01:40:38,644
Where? Now?

1664
01:40:38,722 --> 01:40:44,217
I don't think I know where that spot
in the park is. Where is it?

1665
01:40:44,294 --> 01:40:47,058
All right. I'll find it.

1666
01:40:58,875 --> 01:41:01,571
- You're late!
- Could you pick a more secluded spot?

1667
01:41:01,645 --> 01:41:04,808
- Did anyone follow you?
- No! No one followed me.

1668
01:41:04,881 --> 01:41:09,409
- Wait until I tell you what Amanda said.
- I have to explain something to you.

1669
01:41:09,486 --> 01:41:13,286
Due to circumstances,
I think I should really

1670
01:41:13,356 --> 01:41:18,555
get away to a less conspicuous venue.
Maybe like Alaska or something.

1671
01:41:18,628 --> 01:41:21,654
- What are you talking about?
- You have to go by yourself.

1672
01:41:21,732 --> 01:41:23,962
- I'm not going.
- What?

1673
01:41:24,034 --> 01:41:28,027
You have the job. It's there
waiting for you. It's all done.

1674
01:41:28,105 --> 01:41:31,836
No, no, no.
That's not the deal.

1675
01:41:31,908 --> 01:41:34,376
We go as a team, Dobel.

1676
01:41:34,444 --> 01:41:37,004
You're grown up.
You can handle it alone.

1677
01:41:37,080 --> 01:41:39,640
I don't understand.
What happened?

1678
01:41:39,716 --> 01:41:41,149
You don't want to know.

1679
01:41:41,218 --> 01:41:44,619
You can't cop out
and not give me an explanation.

1680
01:41:44,688 --> 01:41:48,624
I've changed my whole life around.
What happened?

1681
01:41:48,692 --> 01:41:52,526
Just some nonsense, Falk.
You know.

1682
01:41:52,596 --> 01:41:56,464
The other night,
I was out of state.

1683
01:41:56,533 --> 01:41:59,024
Don't ask me where.
The less you know, the better.

1684
01:41:59,102 --> 01:42:02,128
I was trying to sell my car

1685
01:42:02,205 --> 01:42:06,141
to a potential buyer as a preamble
to our trip to California.

1686
01:42:06,209 --> 01:42:09,406
And I was coming home,
speeding a little bit.

1687
01:42:09,479 --> 01:42:14,473
What's the fun of having a car like that
if you can't get a little velocity going?

1688
01:42:14,551 --> 01:42:18,544
And I was stopped
by two state troopers.

1689
01:42:18,622 --> 01:42:23,855
They were exceptionally nasty,
and one thing led to another.

1690
01:42:23,927 --> 01:42:26,259
They made some remarks
and got physical,

1691
01:42:26,329 --> 01:42:30,163
and I made some remarks,
and they got a little rough,

1692
01:42:30,233 --> 01:42:36,399
and the next thing I knew,
they made some crack about my religion,

1693
01:42:36,473 --> 01:42:38,134
which I found in poor taste.

1694
01:42:38,208 --> 01:42:41,006
Religion? You're an atheist.

1695
01:42:41,077 --> 01:42:43,545
Yes, I'm an atheist, but...

1696
01:42:43,613 --> 01:42:47,379
but I resented the fact,
however obliquely

1697
01:42:47,450 --> 01:42:51,819
that they implied Auschwitz
was basically a theme park.

1698
01:42:51,888 --> 01:42:55,289
Anyhow, a little bloodied,
I returned to my apartment

1699
01:42:55,358 --> 01:43:00,921
and got one of my many weapons,
and I returned to find them.

1700
01:43:00,997 --> 01:43:04,626
Don't you dare tell me you shot them.

1701
01:43:04,701 --> 01:43:07,795
I couldn't find both of them,
only one.

1702
01:43:07,871 --> 01:43:11,864
As fate turned out, I located
the more porcine of the two.

1703
01:43:11,942 --> 01:43:13,876
How serious?

1704
01:43:13,944 --> 01:43:18,847
In a satirical mood,
I thought it would be amusing

1705
01:43:18,915 --> 01:43:23,648
if I shot him in the ass,
but it was dark and I was nervous,

1706
01:43:23,720 --> 01:43:28,487
and, you know,
time has diminished my accuracy.

1707
01:43:28,558 --> 01:43:30,389
[Falk sighs] Dobel!

1708
01:43:31,294 --> 01:43:33,285
Dobel!

1709
01:43:33,363 --> 01:43:34,955
My God!

1710
01:43:35,031 --> 01:43:39,991
I always knew I would use
the survival kit one day.

1711
01:43:40,070 --> 01:43:46,202
It's just for a period of time
until everything blows over, I suppose.

1712
01:43:46,276 --> 01:43:50,713
God. Oh, Dobel.

1713
01:43:51,915 --> 01:43:53,883
Dobel.

1714
01:44:11,201 --> 01:44:13,192
<i>[</i>Falk.<i>:]</i> I never knew
If Dobel's story was true

1715
01:44:13,270 --> 01:44:16,535
orjust a plece of flctlon
he used to get me to go alone.

1716
01:44:16,606 --> 01:44:20,702
I never saw or heard from hlm agaln.

1717
01:44:20,777 --> 01:44:24,269
For all I know, he's Ice flshlng
somewhere In the Yukon.

1718
01:44:24,347 --> 01:44:29,011
I thought a lot about that strange,
sad, lmprobable character

1719
01:44:29,085 --> 01:44:32,782
and remembered very fondly
our afternoons In Central Park.

1720
01:44:32,856 --> 01:44:37,623
[Dobel:] In life, they'll be no shortage
of people who'll tell you how to live.

1721
01:44:37,694 --> 01:44:41,221
They'll have all the answers...
what you should do and not do.

1722
01:44:41,298 --> 01:44:45,394
Don't argue with them.
Say, "Yes, that's a brilliant idea,"

1723
01:44:45,468 --> 01:44:47,163
and do what you want.

1724
01:44:47,237 --> 01:44:50,764
Whenever you write,
strive for originality,

1725
01:44:50,840 --> 01:44:53,468
but if you have to steal,
steal from the best.

1726
01:44:53,543 --> 01:44:57,536
And if you take very good care
of your styptic pencil

1727
01:44:57,614 --> 01:44:59,548
and dry it after every shave,

1728
01:44:59,616 --> 01:45:02,813
it'll last longer than most
relationships you're in.

1729
01:45:02,886 --> 01:45:06,378
<i>[</i>Falk.<i>:]</i> The semlnal joke about Dobel
Is the old one-llner.<i>:</i>

1730
01:45:06,456 --> 01:45:10,517
That even a clock that's broken
Is rlght twlce a day.

1731
01:45:10,593 --> 01:45:14,427
Dobel had a real sense of Irony
and would have appreclated

1732
01:45:14,497 --> 01:45:17,398
that I got one last,
to use hls word,

1733
01:45:17,467 --> 01:45:22,598
adventltlous gllmpse of Amanda
as I was leavlng for JFK.

1734
01:45:39,089 --> 01:45:40,647
The doctor!

1735
01:45:42,792 --> 01:45:45,124
I knew that doctor was hot for her.

1736
01:45:45,195 --> 01:45:47,060
[Cab driver:] What'd you say?

1737
01:45:47,130 --> 01:45:51,294
I was just saying how strange life is,

1738
01:45:51,368 --> 01:45:54,496
how full of inexplicable mystery.

1739
01:45:54,571 --> 01:45:58,132
[Driver:] Well, you know,
it's like anything else.

1740
01:46:00,343 --> 01:46:03,471
# You'd be

1741
01:46:03,546 --> 01:46:06,947
# So easy to love

1742
01:46:07,017 --> 01:46:10,186
# So easy to Idollze

1743
01:46:10,653 --> 01:46:13,554
# All others above

1744
01:46:13,622 --> 01:46:19,492
# So worth the yearnlng for

1745
01:46:19,562 --> 01:46:26,866
# So swell to keep
Every home flre burnlng for

# We'd be

1747
01:46:29,772 --> 01:46:33,469
# So grand at the game

1748
01:46:33,542 --> 01:46:36,773
# So carefree together that It

1749
01:46:36,845 --> 01:46:40,008
# Does seem a shame

1750
01:46:40,082 --> 01:46:43,347
# That you can't see

1751
01:46:43,419 --> 01:46:45,250
# Your future wlth me

1752

Oh-so easy to love
