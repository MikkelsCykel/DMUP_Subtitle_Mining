00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:06,960
- You got all your stuff?
- Yeah.

2
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:17,387
When you get there,
be sure and call us.

3
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:19,931
- We want to know where you are.
- All right.

4
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:38,283
- How are you fixed for money?
- I'm okay.

5
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:45,373
You better take this 50...

6
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:48,960
in case you run
into a little trouble.

7
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:52,339
You never know what's gonna happen
between here and there.

8
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:56,176
Thank you.

9
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:02,766
Boy--

10
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:07,771
Don't worry too much.

11
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:12,108
It's just the smart people
that have to worry.

12
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,945
The Lord will take care
of the ignorant ones.

13
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:17,781
- You paying attention?
- Right.

14
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:25,664
See you.

15

Any person who alters...

16
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:28,518
forges, knowingly destroys...

17
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,812
knowingly mutilates...

18
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:34,607
or in any manner

may be fined not to exceed $10,000...

20
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:42,240
or imprisoned
for not more than five years...

21
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:44,242
or both.

22
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:25,575
When the moon

23
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:29,078
Is in the seventh house

24
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,414
And Jupiter

25
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:35,043
Aligns with Mars

26
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:37,253
Then peace

27
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:41,007
Will guide the planets

28
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:43,176
And love

29
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:44,803
Will steer the stars

30
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:50,099
This is the dawning
of the Age of Aquarius

31
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,869
Harmony and understanding

32
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:13,289
Sympathy and trust abounding

33
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:16,000
No more falsehoods or derisions

34
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:19,546
Golden livin' dreams of visions

35
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,589
Mystic crystal revelation

36
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:25,510
And the mind's true liberation

37
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:51,656
Excuse me, ma'am.
Could you spare some change?

38
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:53,491
That's a great hat you've got.

39
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:55,409
Can you spare
a couple nickels or dimes?

40
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:58,204
Beautiful horse.

41
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:00,081
I've never ridden a horse.

42
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:01,541
Is it difficult?

43
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:06,712
Would it be possible for me
to ride it a little ways?

44
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:10,091
Just once, for a minute?

45
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:13,553
Lady, could I ride--

46
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:17,056
Come on. Please?

47
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:20,560
Woof, forget it.
I'll get you one for Christmas.

48
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:23,563
Spare some change?

49
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:29,902
You know,
like nickels, dimes, quarters?

50
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:33,614
- You want me to give you some money?
- Right.

51
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:35,366
Why?

52
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,248
No reason, except she's pregnant
and we haven't eaten for two days.

53
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,420
I don't believe you.

54
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:51,716
- Where you from?
- Oklahoma.

55
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:56,887
I know how it feels.

56
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,098
I used to come from Kansas.

57
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:44,537

60
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:57,800
Pederasty

61
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:03,430
Father, why do these words sound

62
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:06,517
So nasty

63
00:12:07,434 --> 00:12:11,021
Masturbation

64
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:15,276
Can be fun

65
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,780
Join the holy orgy

66
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:22,783
Kama Sutra

67
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:26,370
Everyone

68
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:44,930
Get the horse!
Stop the horse!

69
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:59,445
Go get them!

70
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:04,158
Once upon a looking for Donna time

71
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:06,160
There was a 16-year-old virgin

72
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:08,871
Oh, Donna

73
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:11,123
Looking for my Donna

74
00:13:11,206 --> 00:13:12,666
I just got back
from looking for Donna

75
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,377
San Francisco's
psychedelic urchin

76
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,800
Have you seen

77
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:24,178
My 16-year-old tattooed woman

78
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:26,013
Heard a story

79
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:28,265
She got busted for her beauty

80
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:46,492
And I'm gonna show her
life on Earth can be sweet

81
00:13:46,533 --> 00:13:50,663
Gonna lay my mutated head
at her feet

82
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:53,666
I'm gonna love
to make love to her

83
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:55,834
Till the sky turns brown

84
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:58,170
I'm evolving

85
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:02,132
Through the drugs

86
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:06,136
That you put down

87
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,776

Man, you're a real cowboy.

90
00:14:49,012 --> 00:14:51,682
Don't get off. We still got
15 minutes left. Take off.

91
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:55,185
- I got some things I gotta do.
- Yeah? Like what?

92
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,980
I want to see
the Empire State Building.

93
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:02,568
Then tomorrow, I want to go
on that boat ride around Manhattan.

94
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:06,238
- You see the Statue of Liberty.
- Sounds real good.

95
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:14,913
If you have any ideas
about things to do while I'm here--

96
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:17,416
I don't have too much time.

97
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:19,877
I'm going in the army
in a couple days.

98
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:34,433
I think we can help you.

108
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:06,757
Here, man.

109
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:10,928
Claude, speak to me.

110
00:16:20,979 --> 00:16:22,481
Is she really pregnant?

111
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:29,947
Yeah, I am.

112
00:16:29,988 --> 00:16:31,948
That's what she says.

113
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:34,576
"That's what she says."
That's what she knows.

114
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:38,789
- I am.
- Jeannie, you don't know anything.

115
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:42,793
- I know who the father is.
- Yeah?

116
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:45,379
You know that, you know a lot.

117
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:49,758
If the baby comes out white
and squishy, crying his ass off...

118
00:16:49,841 --> 00:16:51,677
then we know Woof
is definitely the daddy.

119
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:55,055
But if he comes out all beautiful
and chocolate brown...

120
00:16:55,138 --> 00:16:56,556
that's mine.

121
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,685
- "White and squishy"?
- Yeah, man.

122
00:17:03,146 --> 00:17:05,732
He come out and see
your crazy black ass standing there...

123
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:08,402
he's gonna be spitting
watermelon seeds in your face.

124
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:11,446
You always open up your mouth
before you even think.

125
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,449
Look, when this baby
comes out and sees me...

126
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,119
he's gonna be so happy
and so proud.

127
00:17:17,994 --> 00:17:19,579

00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:08,462
If you invite this man to dinner

145
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:10,046
You're gonna have to feed him

So you say

155
00:18:51,504 --> 00:18:53,465
Say something to boogie man.

Finds that it's groovy
to hide in a movie

169
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,594

Thank you.

What?

208
00:24:28,132 --> 00:24:29,550
I want to show you something.

What is it?

210
00:24:33,554 --> 00:24:34,972
Just come here, please.

211
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:45,107
- What?
- Look at that.

212
00:24:47,485 --> 00:24:50,363
- That's the chick on the horse.
- That's not her.

213
00:24:50,446 --> 00:24:52,949
What do you mean?
Look at it.

00:25:07,004 --> 00:25:08,756
You want to go?

218
00:25:10,174 --> 00:25:11,592
Why?

219
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:14,262
Don't you want to meet her?

220
00:25:14,345 --> 00:25:16,430
Don't you have
to be invited to those?

221
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:21,769
Would you like to come
to a party with me?

222
00:26:10,985 --> 00:26:13,696
You guys spread out. Mingle.

223
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,980
Sit, my dear.

224
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:51,108
Steve?

225
00:26:57,406 --> 00:27:00,576
- Great party, huh?
- Yeah.

226
00:27:04,997 --> 00:27:09,752
There's an odd-looking
character over there.

227
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:14,924
And here to the right,
that chap over there.

228
00:27:17,134 --> 00:27:19,386
That colored gentleman over there
with the girl.

229
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:22,890
See those two girls there?
Do you know them?

230
00:27:22,973 --> 00:27:27,686
Why don't you just
unobtrusively...

231
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:30,773
see if you can find out
who they are, how they got here...

232
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:33,609
who invited them,
and come back and let me know.

233
00:27:33,692 --> 00:27:35,110
Sure thing.

234
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:40,991
Hi, I'm Steve Wright.

235
00:27:44,203 --> 00:27:47,164
- What's your name?
- Hud.

236
00:27:52,044 --> 00:27:53,629
Are you supposed to be here?

237
00:27:57,383 --> 00:28:01,136
- I mean, who brought you guys?
- Mr. Berger.

238
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:05,516
Enjoy the party.

239
00:28:10,479 --> 00:28:12,398
They're with Mr. Berger.

240
00:28:12,481 --> 00:28:14,900
- Mr. Berger?
- Yeah.

241
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:17,403
Who's Mr. Berger?

242
00:28:17,486 --> 00:28:19,989
I don't know.

243
00:28:20,072 --> 00:28:23,909
Don't even suck on it
if you don't want to burn your lips.

244
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:26,912
- Now?
- Now start puffing on it.

245
00:28:29,498 --> 00:28:31,250
- There. See?
- Sheila?

246
00:28:31,333 --> 00:28:32,918
Just a minute.

247
00:28:38,507 --> 00:28:40,759
What's taking so long, love?

248
00:28:40,843 --> 00:28:42,928
- We're smoking grass.
- I'm getting dressed.

249
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:45,931
Sweetheart, come on. You have a lot
of people waiting to see you.

250
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:48,350
Will you relax, Daddy?

251
00:28:48,434 --> 00:28:51,770
- Hurry up.
- What's going on here?

252
00:28:51,854 --> 00:28:54,273
- They're getting dressed.
- Open the door this minute!

253
00:28:54,356 --> 00:28:56,817
- I'm taking care of it.
- I can see you are.

254
00:29:00,612 --> 00:29:02,906
Yes?

255
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:05,534
There's no excuse
for this performance.

256
00:29:10,414 --> 00:29:11,874
Hello.

257
00:29:52,331 --> 00:29:54,625
Excuse me.
Mr. Berger?

258
00:29:54,708 --> 00:29:57,127
- You can call me George.
- I think that it's a private party.

259
00:29:57,169 --> 00:30:00,255
I think you and your friends
better leave, please.

260
00:30:00,339 --> 00:30:03,425
- You do?
- Yes, I think that's the thing to do.

261
00:30:11,475 --> 00:30:15,187
Excuse me, everybody.
Everybody, please quiet down.

262
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:17,606
I think that you and you're--

263
00:30:17,648 --> 00:30:19,274
I just wanted to say a few words,
then we'll go.

264
00:30:19,358 --> 00:30:22,069
- I don't care what you have to say.
- I know. Everybody, listen.

265
00:30:23,779 --> 00:30:28,283
We weren't invited to this party--
I just want to talk for a second.

266
00:30:28,367 --> 00:30:31,453
- I don't care about that.
- I know you don't care.

267
00:30:31,495 --> 00:30:34,957
- I think you better leave.
- Please, just give me two minutes.

268
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,750
All right?

269
00:30:37,876 --> 00:30:40,337
- Please.
- No, I think you better go.

270
00:30:42,714 --> 00:30:45,384
I'm losing my patience.
This is a private party.

271
00:30:45,467 --> 00:30:48,679
-You were not invited. You better leave.
-You don't understand.

272
00:30:48,762 --> 00:30:50,764
- I have nothing to understand.
- You have something to understand.

273
00:30:50,848 --> 00:30:52,391
You don't understand what this man
will be doing for you.

274
00:30:52,474 --> 00:30:55,686
- I don't want to hear about it.
- You should hear about it!

275
00:30:55,769 --> 00:30:58,021
- You know what he's gonna do for you?
- I don't care!

276
00:30:58,063 --> 00:31:01,775
You should care because
he's gonna be fighting for you.

277
00:31:01,859 --> 00:31:07,281
He's going to Vietnam to fight for you,
to save your life!

278
00:31:07,364 --> 00:31:09,324
- I want you out!
- You should care!

279
00:31:12,536 --> 00:31:16,290
If you want me out of here,
you'll have to throw me out.

280
00:31:16,373 --> 00:31:18,959
That's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

281
00:31:20,252 --> 00:31:23,630
I won't muss myself up
fussing with you.

282
00:31:23,714 --> 00:31:26,717
I'll get the police if I have to.

283
00:31:34,224 --> 00:31:35,684
Penguin.

284
00:31:37,227 --> 00:31:40,814
Now, my friend, Claude, here
is in love.

285
00:31:40,897 --> 00:31:42,482
He saw this chick on a horse--

286
00:31:42,566 --> 00:31:44,067
- Excuse me.
- Jesus.

287
00:31:44,151 --> 00:31:47,237
Now, let's deal with this
as gentlemen.

288
00:31:48,238 --> 00:31:50,657
- Quietly.
- Good.

289
00:31:50,741 --> 00:31:53,327
- May I give you a word of advice?
- Yeah.

290
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:56,997
Get your ass out of here, now.

291
00:31:58,415 --> 00:31:59,833
Is that it?

292
00:31:59,916 --> 00:32:02,044
- Yes.
- Thank you.

293
00:32:02,085 --> 00:32:03,879
Now, listen.

294
00:32:03,962 --> 00:32:05,505
Claude here is in love.

295
00:32:05,589 --> 00:32:09,092
The girl he's in love with
is sitting in this room.

296
00:32:09,176 --> 00:32:14,264
He just wants to sit here
and look at her for five minutes.

297
00:32:14,348 --> 00:32:17,768
He just wants to look at her
and have this picture in his head...

298
00:32:17,851 --> 00:32:19,853
when he's off there fighting
in the jungles.

299
00:32:22,856 --> 00:32:26,818
Is that so much to ask?
This is for you, man.

300
00:32:26,902 --> 00:32:29,279
Wait a minute.
This is what you want.

301
00:32:29,363 --> 00:32:32,991
Sheila, is that okay if Claude
just sits here and looks at you...

302
00:32:33,075 --> 00:32:35,619
for a few minutes
before we go?

303
00:32:37,704 --> 00:32:40,874
You've got a hell of a nerve,
young man.

304
00:32:46,713 --> 00:32:50,842
I got life, mother

305
00:32:50,926 --> 00:32:55,305
I got laughs, sister

306
00:32:55,389 --> 00:33:00,602
I got freedom, brother

307
00:33:00,644 --> 00:33:05,816
And I got good times, man

308
00:33:07,901 --> 00:33:11,780
I got crazy ways, daughter

309
00:33:11,863 --> 00:33:16,076
I got million-dollar charm, cousin

310
00:33:16,993 --> 00:33:20,789
I got headaches and toothaches

311
00:33:20,872 --> 00:33:23,250
And bad times too

312
00:33:23,333 --> 00:33:27,254
Like you

313
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,675
I got my hair, I got my head
I got my brains, I got my ears

314
00:33:31,758 --> 00:33:33,385
I got my eyes
I got my nose

315
00:33:33,468 --> 00:33:36,680
I got my mouth
I got my teeth

316
00:33:36,763 --> 00:33:40,934
I got my tongue, I got my chin
I got my neck, I got my tits

317
00:33:41,017 --> 00:33:43,478
I got my heart, I got my soul
I got my back

318
00:33:43,562 --> 00:33:46,106
I got my ass

319
00:33:46,189 --> 00:33:50,068
I got my arms, I got my hands
I got my fingers, Got my legs

320
00:33:50,152 --> 00:33:53,780
I got my feet, I got my toes
I got my liver, Got my blood

321
00:34:13,842 --> 00:34:16,219
- Watch out!
- Oh, my God!

322
00:34:43,705 --> 00:34:46,666
Got my guts
Got my muscles

323
00:35:05,435 --> 00:35:06,895
Lafayette Johnson.

324
00:35:06,936 --> 00:35:09,064
Jeannie Ryan.

325
00:35:09,147 --> 00:35:11,566
Woof Daschund.

326
00:35:11,608 --> 00:35:15,737
The court is about to pronounce
sentence upon each of you.

327
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:17,280
The sentence of the court:

328
00:35:17,322 --> 00:35:20,408
You be confined to the workhouse
for 30 days...

329
00:35:20,492 --> 00:35:23,620
or pay a fine of $50.

330
00:35:23,703 --> 00:35:28,958
Your Honor,
I don't think you understand.

331
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,460
We haven't got any bread.

332
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:33,922
I'm sorry.
There isn't anything I can do.

333
00:35:39,511 --> 00:35:41,221
- Your Honor?
- Yes, sir?

334
00:35:41,304 --> 00:35:43,598
What if one of us has the money?

335
00:35:43,681 --> 00:35:45,892
- Which one?
- I do.

336
00:35:55,485 --> 00:35:58,321
You may proceed
to pay your fine.

337
00:36:01,241 --> 00:36:03,910
Proceed to the clerk's office.

338
00:36:05,495 --> 00:36:07,914
- Excuse me, Your Honor.
- What's your name?

339
00:36:09,165 --> 00:36:12,085
Wait a second.
Put down George Berger.

340
00:36:12,168 --> 00:36:14,963
- Bukowski.
- Just one second. Claude, listen.

341
00:36:15,004 --> 00:36:17,424
Let me get out of here.
I'll go and get the money.

342
00:36:17,507 --> 00:36:19,759
- Then I'll get everybody out.
- This is my money.

343
00:36:19,843 --> 00:36:23,596
I'm sorry, but my dad gave me
this money in case of trouble.

344
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,265
- This is trouble.
- Don't be stupid, man.

345
00:36:25,348 --> 00:36:28,101
This is your last chance
to get us out of here.

346
00:36:28,184 --> 00:36:31,020
Just stop it. This is mine.
I'm getting out of here.

347
00:36:32,689 --> 00:36:36,025
- Don't you trust me?
- Of course not.

348
00:36:37,777 --> 00:36:39,487
Look, man, don't be stupid.

349
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:45,118
How will you get the bread?
You don't know anybody on the streets.

350
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:54,627
He's not. He's just gonna leave us
in here to rot, that's all.

351
00:36:54,711 --> 00:36:58,548
- I can make some calls.
- Yeah, call my mama.

352
00:37:07,557 --> 00:37:10,059
You better know what you're doing.

353
00:37:10,143 --> 00:37:12,103
You sure better, George.

354
00:37:38,504 --> 00:37:39,923
What's that?

355
00:37:51,851 --> 00:37:54,604
Excuse me.
You're in our way.

356
00:37:54,687 --> 00:37:56,105
What?

357
00:37:57,357 --> 00:38:00,234
You're blocking our way.
Would you move, please?

358
00:38:00,276 --> 00:38:01,736
Sure.

359
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,920
Hi. Remember me?

360
00:38:19,962 --> 00:38:21,422
Yeah.

361
00:38:22,465 --> 00:38:23,925
Come on in.

362
00:38:25,635 --> 00:38:27,428
We have to get to school.

363
00:38:27,512 --> 00:38:29,597
Great.
Just get in, will you?

364
00:38:29,681 --> 00:38:31,599
What do you want?

365
00:38:35,269 --> 00:38:37,772
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

366
00:38:39,232 --> 00:38:41,943
Jesus Christ!
What do you think you're doing?

367
00:38:41,984 --> 00:38:45,905
You can't drive this car!
We're only covered for Dad and me.

368
00:38:47,532 --> 00:38:50,284
I got a little problem.
I need some bread right away.

369
00:38:50,326 --> 00:38:52,954
It's $250.
I need it now.

370
00:38:52,995 --> 00:38:56,290
- This is all about money?
- Yeah. You got any?

371
00:38:58,835 --> 00:39:00,962
We really don't have
any time now.

372
00:39:01,003 --> 00:39:04,882
We've got to be at school.
So will you just stop the car?

373
00:39:04,966 --> 00:39:06,592
Just let me drive.

374
00:39:09,804 --> 00:39:12,974
- What do you want me to do?
- Tell him to stop.

375
00:39:14,058 --> 00:39:16,060
Stop.

376
00:39:17,019 --> 00:39:19,605
My friends are still in jail.

377
00:39:19,689 --> 00:39:22,066
You could ask your old man
for the bread to get them out.

378
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:24,402
- Ask my father for the money?
- Yeah.

379
00:39:24,485 --> 00:39:26,404
Right.

380
00:39:26,487 --> 00:39:29,907
He got us into this.
At least he could get us out of it.

381
00:39:29,991 --> 00:39:31,909
- He got you into this?
- Yeah.

382
00:39:31,993 --> 00:39:35,913
He told you to dance on the table
and break all the dishes?

383
00:39:35,997 --> 00:39:37,748
There's a left here
at the bottom of the hill.

384
00:39:37,832 --> 00:39:40,084
- I think you're really crazy.
- What are you talking about?

385
00:39:40,168 --> 00:39:43,754
The man got the kids in jail.
We want the money to get them out.

386
00:39:43,838 --> 00:39:45,256
- Coming up is a left.
- It's impossible.

387
00:39:45,339 --> 00:39:47,758
- Why is it impossible?
- He won't even give me a credit card.

388
00:39:47,842 --> 00:39:49,760
- With that house you live in?
- It's coming up here!

389
00:39:49,844 --> 00:39:52,555
- Two hundred and fifty dollars.
- Right here!

390
00:39:52,638 --> 00:39:54,932
Turn left! Right here!

391
00:39:55,016 --> 00:39:57,435
Jesus! You missed it!

392
00:39:57,518 --> 00:39:59,270
What did I miss, Steve?

393
00:39:59,353 --> 00:40:02,106
The school.
It's back there.

394
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:04,942
I'm sorry.

395
00:40:23,419 --> 00:40:27,173
We'll help you, okay?
We'll try to get you some money.

396
00:40:27,215 --> 00:40:30,009
So you can stop the car now,
and I'll drive.

397
00:40:31,761 --> 00:40:34,597
- When?
- Right after school.

398
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:40,186
About 4:00.
We'll have it for you at 4:00.

399
00:40:41,979 --> 00:40:45,191
That's my other problem, man.

400
00:40:45,233 --> 00:40:47,860
- What?
- You're full of shit.

401
00:40:53,741 --> 00:40:57,453
You won't ask your old man for
the bread, and Junior is full of shit.

402
00:40:58,746 --> 00:41:00,706
What am I doing here?

403
00:41:30,236 --> 00:41:33,239
- And men?
- What do you mean?

404
00:41:33,322 --> 00:41:35,574
Do you have any sexual attraction
towards men?

405
00:41:39,578 --> 00:41:42,873
- Am I a homosexual?
- Yeah.

406
00:41:42,915 --> 00:41:46,043
I wouldn't kick Mick Jagger
out of my bed...

407
00:41:46,085 --> 00:41:49,922
but I'm not a homosexual.

408
00:41:49,964 --> 00:41:54,802
Can you tell me why you're so uptight
about having your hair cut?

409
00:41:58,472 --> 00:42:02,435
She asked me why

410
00:42:02,476 --> 00:42:05,438
I'm just a hairy guy

411
00:42:07,356 --> 00:42:09,608
I'm hairy, noon and night

412
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:13,904
Hair that's a fright

413
00:42:15,531 --> 00:42:19,118
I'm hairy, high and low

414
00:42:19,201 --> 00:42:21,620
Don't ask me why

415
00:42:21,704 --> 00:42:23,622
Don't know

416
00:42:25,124 --> 00:42:28,627
It's not for lack of bread

417
00:42:28,711 --> 00:42:33,340
Like the Grateful Dead

418
00:42:33,424 --> 00:42:36,886
Darling

419
00:42:36,969 --> 00:42:40,890
Give me a head with hair
Long, beautiful hair

420
00:42:40,973 --> 00:42:44,310
Shining, gleaming
steamin', flaxen, waxen

421
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:46,061
Give me it down to there
Hair

422
00:42:46,145 --> 00:42:47,855
Shoulder-length or longer

423
00:42:47,938 --> 00:42:51,192
Here, baby, There, Mama
Everywhere, Daddy

424
00:42:51,275 --> 00:42:54,236
Hair

425
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,988
Grow it, Show it

426
00:42:56,071 --> 00:42:58,491
Long as God can grow it
My hair

427
00:42:59,617 --> 00:43:01,285
Let it fly in the breeze

428
00:43:01,327 --> 00:43:02,995
And get caught in the trees

429
00:43:03,078 --> 00:43:05,748
Give a home to the fleas
in my hair

430
00:43:06,832 --> 00:43:08,584
A home for fleas

431
00:43:08,667 --> 00:43:10,127
A hive for the buzzin' bees

432
00:43:10,211 --> 00:43:11,795
A nest for birds
There ain't no words

433
00:43:11,837 --> 00:43:16,800
For the beauty, the splendor
the wonder of my hair

434
00:43:16,842 --> 00:43:18,677
Flow it, Show it

435
00:43:21,847 --> 00:43:24,475
I want it long, straight
curly, fuzzy

436
00:43:24,517 --> 00:43:27,269
Snaggy, shaggy, ratty, matty
oily, greasy, fleecy

437
00:43:27,353 --> 00:43:28,646
Shining, gleaming, steaming

438
00:43:28,687 --> 00:43:31,523
Flaxen, waxen
knotted, polka-dotted

439
00:43:31,607 --> 00:43:33,484
Twisted, beaded, braided

440
00:43:33,525 --> 00:43:34,860
- Powdered, flowered
- And confettied

441
00:43:34,902 --> 00:43:36,612
- Bangled
- Tangled, spangled

442
00:43:36,695 --> 00:43:39,323
And spaghettied

443
00:43:39,365 --> 00:43:44,370
Oh, say can you see my eyes

444
00:43:44,453 --> 00:43:46,956
- If you can
- Then my hair's too short

445
00:43:47,039 --> 00:43:49,959
- Down to here
- Down to there

446
00:43:50,042 --> 00:43:51,502
Down to where
it stops by itself

447
00:43:55,381 --> 00:43:58,050
They'll be ga-ga at the go-go
When they see me in my toga

448
00:43:58,133 --> 00:44:01,762
My toga made of blond
brilliantined, biblical hair

449
00:44:01,845 --> 00:44:03,514
My hair like Jesus wore it

450
00:44:03,597 --> 00:44:05,057
Hallelujah, I adore it

451
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:07,309
Hallelujah, Mary loved her son

452
00:44:07,393 --> 00:44:09,061
Why don't my mother love me

453
00:44:28,122 --> 00:44:31,083
You know, Danny's mother said
Danny said to say hello.

454
00:44:31,125 --> 00:44:33,544
He's in second year
of dental school...

455
00:44:33,585 --> 00:44:37,381
and the girl he's dating
is beautiful, nice.

456
00:44:37,423 --> 00:44:40,676
It's got a lot of mayonnaise,
the way you like, both sides.

457
00:44:40,759 --> 00:44:42,177
- Eat it.
- Thanks, Mom.

458
00:44:42,261 --> 00:44:44,430
- It's good. Eat it.
- I will.

459
00:44:44,513 --> 00:44:48,100
Give me your pants.
I'll wash them.

460
00:44:48,183 --> 00:44:51,103
- Why?
- They're dirty.

461
00:44:51,145 --> 00:44:53,230
They're fine.
They're not dirty.

462
00:44:53,272 --> 00:44:55,232
It'll take a minute.

463
00:44:55,274 --> 00:44:56,942
The pants are fine, Ma.

464
00:44:56,984 --> 00:44:59,403
What do you say, Pop?

465
00:44:59,445 --> 00:45:01,280
What do you say, what?

466
00:45:01,321 --> 00:45:03,282
Nothing, Ma.

467
00:45:09,288 --> 00:45:12,750
- If you need money, get a job.
- You talking about money?

468
00:45:14,084 --> 00:45:16,545
- What do you need money for?
- Nothing, I just need it.

469
00:45:16,628 --> 00:45:20,132
- Who is she?
- Who is who?

470
00:45:20,215 --> 00:45:21,800
- The girl?
- What girl?

471
00:45:21,884 --> 00:45:23,844
- Who is the girl?
- There's no girl.

472
00:45:23,927 --> 00:45:26,054
You can tell us everything.
We understand everything.

473
00:45:26,138 --> 00:45:27,931
What are you talking about?
I just need some money.

474
00:45:27,973 --> 00:45:29,808
If you need the money,
tell us the truth.

475
00:45:29,850 --> 00:45:32,019
What are you talking about?

476
00:45:32,102 --> 00:45:34,897
Goddamn it. Every time
you come home, there's trouble.

477
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:38,066
Why don't you clean yourself up?
Why don't you get a haircut?

478
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:41,320
Get a haircut,
and I'll give you the money.

479
00:45:41,403 --> 00:45:42,946
You'll give me the money
if I get a haircut?

480
00:45:42,988 --> 00:45:45,741
For Christ's sake,
do something to make us happy!

481
00:45:45,824 --> 00:45:48,285
- What?
- Will you give me $500?

482
00:45:48,327 --> 00:45:50,829
- Give me your pants!
- My pants are clean!

483
00:45:50,871 --> 00:45:53,415
They're clean,
for Christ's sake!

484
00:46:02,216 --> 00:46:04,176
How much you need?

485
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:47,219
The draft is white people...

486
00:46:47,302 --> 00:46:49,096
sending black people...

487
00:46:49,179 --> 00:46:51,056
to make war on the yellow people...

488
00:46:51,139 --> 00:46:53,559
to defend land they stole...

489
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:56,311
from the red people!

490
00:47:00,399 --> 00:47:05,028
LBJ took the IRT

491
00:47:05,112 --> 00:47:09,449
Down to Fourth Street, USA

492
00:47:11,076 --> 00:47:13,662
When he got there

493
00:47:13,745 --> 00:47:15,580
What did he see

494
00:47:16,331 --> 00:47:20,585
Tricky Dick on LSD

495
00:47:37,436 --> 00:47:40,063
FBI

496
00:47:40,105 --> 00:47:42,024
CIA

497
00:47:54,411 --> 00:47:55,954
Come on.

498
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:02,169
Wait, Berger!

499
00:48:08,633 --> 00:48:11,428
- How you doing?
- How are you?

500
00:48:11,511 --> 00:48:15,432
- All right.
- Listen, first...

501
00:48:15,515 --> 00:48:18,226
I want to apologize for Steven.

502
00:48:18,310 --> 00:48:22,481
He's very young,
and he really doesn't understand.

503
00:48:24,566 --> 00:48:29,071
Tell me who do you love

504
00:48:29,154 --> 00:48:30,572
Man

505
00:48:31,323 --> 00:48:34,326
Tell me what, man

506
00:48:34,409 --> 00:48:36,036
Tell me

507
00:48:36,119 --> 00:48:41,041
What did you love, man

508
00:48:42,501 --> 00:48:47,881
Old-fashioned melody

509
00:48:56,348 --> 00:48:59,226
Listen, I was thinking.

510
00:48:59,309 --> 00:49:01,812
Would you like to get married?

511
00:49:01,853 --> 00:49:03,313
What?

512
00:49:07,275 --> 00:49:10,320
- To whom?
- Me.

513
00:49:13,532 --> 00:49:17,702
I'm having this baby,
and, if you were married...

514
00:49:17,786 --> 00:49:20,288
the Army couldn't take you--

515
00:49:20,372 --> 00:49:22,833
They wouldn't take you because they
don't take people who are married...

516
00:49:22,916 --> 00:49:25,293
and having a baby.

517
00:49:40,225 --> 00:49:42,477
We're all encased in sonic armor

518
00:49:42,561 --> 00:49:44,437
Beltin' it out
through chrome grenades

519
00:49:44,521 --> 00:49:47,983
Miles and miles of Medusan chord
The electronic sonic boom

520
00:49:48,066 --> 00:49:51,069
It's what's happening, baby
It's where it's at, Daddy

521
00:49:51,152 --> 00:49:54,698
They chain you and brainwash you
when you least expect it

522
00:49:54,781 --> 00:49:58,660
They feed you mass media
The age is electric

523
00:49:58,743 --> 00:50:00,704
I got the electric blues

524
00:50:22,309 --> 00:50:23,977
Folk rock, rhythm and blues

525
00:52:05,829 --> 00:52:09,207
Do you, Sheila Franklin

526
00:52:09,249 --> 00:52:13,253
Take this man to be

527
00:52:13,336 --> 00:52:16,881
Your lawful wedded husband

528
00:52:18,091 --> 00:52:19,551
I do.

529
00:52:20,844 --> 00:52:24,180
Do you, Claude Hooper Bukowski

530
00:52:24,222 --> 00:52:28,893
Take this woman to be

531
00:52:28,977 --> 00:52:33,147
Your lawful wedded wife

532
00:52:33,231 --> 00:52:34,858
I do.

533
00:52:36,109 --> 00:52:41,239
I now pronounce you
man and wife

534
00:52:52,458 --> 00:52:56,337
Hare Krishna

535
00:52:56,421 --> 00:52:58,172
Krishna

536
00:52:58,256 --> 00:53:00,300
Hare

537
00:53:00,383 --> 00:53:04,304
Hare Rama

538
00:53:04,387 --> 00:53:06,264
Rama

539
00:53:41,633 --> 00:53:44,135
Love

540
00:53:48,973 --> 00:53:51,643
Drop out

541
00:53:53,019 --> 00:53:54,479
Be in

542
00:53:56,689 --> 00:54:00,318
Take trips, get high
Laugh, joke and good-bye

543
00:54:00,401 --> 00:54:02,195
Beat drum and old tin pot

544
00:54:02,278 --> 00:54:04,655
I am high on you-know-what

545
00:54:04,697 --> 00:54:08,284
Marijuana

546
00:54:28,513 --> 00:54:32,225
Beads, flowers
freedom, happiness

547
00:56:29,550 --> 00:56:30,968
Right there.

548
00:56:42,396 --> 00:56:43,898
Are you all right?

549
00:56:47,568 --> 00:56:49,320
Where you been?

550
00:56:49,403 --> 00:56:52,865
Where have we been?
Where have you been, man?

551
00:56:52,948 --> 00:56:54,784
Watching the water.

552
00:56:54,825 --> 00:56:57,244
Let me see your eyes.
Let me see those.

553
00:56:57,328 --> 00:56:59,163
My God, black basketballs.

554
00:56:59,246 --> 00:57:01,499
Look at my face.

555
00:57:01,582 --> 00:57:03,751
Look at the sky.
Look at the stars.

556
00:57:03,834 --> 00:57:05,294
- See the stars?
- Look at that.

557
00:57:05,378 --> 00:57:07,213
Everybody,
a shooting star right over there.

558
00:57:07,296 --> 00:57:09,548
Quick, everybody, make a wish.

559
00:57:15,262 --> 00:57:17,598
Will you take me home now, please?

560
00:57:17,682 --> 00:57:19,809
Why do you want to go home?

561
00:57:19,892 --> 00:57:22,728
It's Claude's last night.
Right?

562
00:57:22,812 --> 00:57:25,231
Are we going to do something?

563
00:57:25,314 --> 00:57:27,441
- Yeah, we'll do something.
- Yeah.

564
00:57:27,525 --> 00:57:29,026
What are you gonna do?

565
00:57:29,110 --> 00:57:31,320
I don't know.
It's Claude's night.

566
00:57:31,362 --> 00:57:33,322
What do you want to do?

567
00:57:38,828 --> 00:57:40,246
Take Sheila home.

568
00:57:41,705 --> 00:57:44,208
She's all yours.

569
00:57:44,291 --> 00:57:45,960
Have a good time.

570
00:57:46,043 --> 00:57:47,920
- I'm just taking her home.
- I know.

571
00:57:48,003 --> 00:57:49,880
Have a good time anyway.

572
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:00,641
Come on, Jeannie.

573
00:58:07,022 --> 00:58:08,941
Come on.

574
00:58:19,201 --> 00:58:21,328
Get your pants off and come on in!

575
00:58:26,625 --> 00:58:28,586
You want to go home?

576
00:58:31,213 --> 00:58:36,010
- You're just taking me home, right?
- Yeah.

577
00:58:36,093 --> 00:58:39,346
- No, you know what I mean.
- I'm just taking you home.

578
00:58:40,306 --> 00:58:42,266
Because nothing's gonna happen.

579
00:58:49,690 --> 00:58:52,318
No, I'll go home by myself.

580
00:58:52,401 --> 00:58:54,320
No, I'll take you home.

581
00:58:55,529 --> 00:58:59,241
- I don't feel like it.
- Why not?

582
00:59:01,660 --> 00:59:04,997
I don't have to explain everything
to you...

583
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:06,498
do l?

584
00:59:19,803 --> 00:59:21,263
Come on, Claude!

585
00:59:27,269 --> 00:59:29,563
The water is filthy.

586
01:00:16,985 --> 01:00:18,654
Listen, I'm sorry.

587
01:00:18,737 --> 01:00:22,199
I didn't mean to be so--

588
01:00:22,282 --> 01:00:24,493
I'm really sorry.
I wasn't trying to upset you.

589
01:00:24,535 --> 01:00:26,412
That's all right.

590
01:00:26,495 --> 01:00:28,956
It's just sometimes I get so--

591
01:00:29,039 --> 01:00:30,666
I understand.

592
01:00:30,749 --> 01:00:32,501
Are you upset?

593
01:00:32,584 --> 01:00:36,004
No, you are.
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

594
01:00:36,046 --> 01:00:41,385
- You're going away tomorrow, right?
- Yeah.

595
01:00:41,427 --> 01:00:44,388
So, what's the point?

596
01:00:44,471 --> 01:00:47,891
You mean, if I wasn't going away,
it would be different?

597
01:00:47,933 --> 01:00:49,351
Maybe.

598
01:00:53,981 --> 01:00:55,107
- I might not go.
- Right.

599
01:00:55,149 --> 01:00:57,276
- You expect me to believe that?
- I'm serious.

600
01:00:57,359 --> 01:00:59,361
Forget it.
I don't believe you.

601
01:01:07,202 --> 01:01:09,538
Where did everybody else go?

602
01:01:09,621 --> 01:01:12,291
They're around somewhere.
Jeannie's still up there.

603
01:01:15,419 --> 01:01:18,172
Where are our clothes?

604
01:01:36,273 --> 01:01:37,691
Where did they take them?

605
01:01:45,365 --> 01:01:46,825
Funny.

606
01:01:48,869 --> 01:01:50,454
You guys are so mature.

607
01:01:50,537 --> 01:01:53,123
Don't look at me.
I didn't have anything to do with it.

608
01:01:57,211 --> 01:01:59,171
Don't worry about it.
They're around.

609
01:02:15,062 --> 01:02:16,480
Taxi!

610
01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:34,247
Don't go! I've got your purse!
Sheila, wait!

611
01:02:44,675 --> 01:02:46,593
I don't believe it, man.
What happened?

612
01:02:47,803 --> 01:02:49,638
What the hell did you do that for?

613
01:02:49,721 --> 01:02:52,557
- It was fun, man.
- Fun?

614
01:02:53,850 --> 01:02:56,728
I'm really sorry.

615
01:02:56,812 --> 01:02:59,356
I didn't think she'd ever
pull a stunt like that.

616
01:02:59,398 --> 01:03:02,150
We know where she lives.
We'll give her clothes back tomorrow.

617
01:03:03,402 --> 01:03:04,820
I won't be here tomorrow.

618
01:03:06,571 --> 01:03:08,448
Are you still serious
about that shit?

619
01:03:10,409 --> 01:03:12,202
That's none
of your goddamn business.

620
01:03:12,244 --> 01:03:15,664
It is my goddamn business, man.
What do you want?

621
01:03:15,747 --> 01:03:18,875
You want to be a hero with a gun,
a big macho dude in a uniform?

622
01:03:18,959 --> 01:03:22,879
- Is that what you want?
- I can't talk to you.

623
01:03:22,921 --> 01:03:25,007
I'm standing right here.
Talk to me.

624
01:03:27,801 --> 01:03:30,345
I think you're ridiculous.

625
01:03:30,429 --> 01:03:33,432
I am ridiculous.

626
01:03:33,515 --> 01:03:36,059
I'm totally ridiculous.
I'm ludicrous.

627
01:03:36,143 --> 01:03:38,395
I don't want to go over there
and murder women and babies.

628
01:03:38,437 --> 01:03:41,773
Go ahead and be ridiculous,
and I'll do what I have to do.

629
01:03:41,857 --> 01:03:43,567
Who are you doing it for?

630
01:03:43,608 --> 01:03:45,110
I'm doing it for you, man.

631
01:03:45,152 --> 01:03:47,404
Don't hand me that.

632
01:03:47,446 --> 01:03:48,947
Don't do it for me.

633
01:03:48,989 --> 01:03:51,450
If the shoe was on the other foot,
I wouldn't do it for you.

634
01:03:56,997 --> 01:03:58,457
Give me my clothes.

635
01:04:12,637 --> 01:04:16,349
How will she get home? She doesn't
have her stuff. She has no bread.

636
01:04:21,062 --> 01:04:23,356
You better get that stuff to her.

637
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:27,694
- Me?
- Yeah.

638
01:04:27,777 --> 01:04:29,404
Wasn't that what you wanted?

639
01:04:34,993 --> 01:04:37,204
You're telling me
I'm ridiculous?

640
01:05:15,533 --> 01:05:18,203
Where do I go

641
01:05:18,286 --> 01:05:19,996
Follow the river

642
01:05:21,873 --> 01:05:23,375
Follow the gulls

643
01:05:24,542 --> 01:05:27,337
Where is the something

644
01:05:27,379 --> 01:05:29,422
Where is the someone

645
01:05:29,506 --> 01:05:33,551
That tells me
why I live and die

646
01:05:36,596 --> 01:05:38,306
Follow the children

647
01:05:39,933 --> 01:05:42,894
Follow their smiles

648
01:05:42,936 --> 01:05:45,063
Is there an answer

649
01:05:45,855 --> 01:05:47,816
In their sweet faces

650
01:05:47,899 --> 01:05:50,694
That tells me why
I live and die

651
01:05:52,612 --> 01:05:54,864
Follow the wind song

652
01:05:54,948 --> 01:05:56,992
Follow the thunder

653
01:05:57,075 --> 01:05:58,535
Follow the neon

654
01:05:58,618 --> 01:06:01,246
In young lovers' eyes

655
01:06:01,329 --> 01:06:03,581
Down to the gutter

656
01:06:03,665 --> 01:06:06,001
Up to the glitter

657
01:06:06,084 --> 01:06:07,544
Into the city

658
01:06:07,585 --> 01:06:09,963
Where the truth lies

659
01:06:12,882 --> 01:06:14,509
Follow my heartbeat

660
01:06:16,428 --> 01:06:19,055
Follow my hand

661
01:06:19,097 --> 01:06:21,933
Where do they lead me

662
01:06:22,017 --> 01:06:23,643
And will I ever

663
01:06:23,727 --> 01:06:29,190
Discover why I live and die

664
01:06:35,030 --> 01:06:39,325
Why do I live

665
01:06:39,409 --> 01:06:43,872
Why do I die

666
01:06:47,792 --> 01:06:49,627
Tell me why

667
01:06:49,669 --> 01:06:51,671
Tell me where

668
01:07:00,346 --> 01:07:01,639
Next.

669
01:07:14,861 --> 01:07:17,280
- Woodrow, Sheldon?
- Yes, sir.

670
01:07:17,322 --> 01:07:18,865
Everything off, please.

671
01:07:24,913 --> 01:07:26,331
Your socks.

672
01:07:35,548 --> 01:07:37,801
Have you got some problem
with your socks?

673
01:07:37,842 --> 01:07:39,260
No, sir.

674
01:07:39,344 --> 01:07:41,095
Then take them off.

675
01:07:53,566 --> 01:07:55,026
Sergeant.

676
01:08:21,052 --> 01:08:23,137
Black boys are delicious

677
01:08:24,722 --> 01:08:27,183
Chocolate-flavored love

678
01:08:27,267 --> 01:08:30,562
Licorice lips like candy

679
01:08:30,645 --> 01:08:33,690
Keep my cocoa handy

680
01:08:33,773 --> 01:08:36,025
I have such a sweet tooth

681
01:08:36,109 --> 01:08:39,070
When it comes to love

682
01:08:39,112 --> 01:08:42,699
Once I tried a diet

683
01:08:42,782 --> 01:08:45,159
Of quiet rest

684
01:08:45,243 --> 01:08:46,369
No sweets

685
01:08:46,411 --> 01:08:49,539
But I went nearly crazy

686
01:08:49,580 --> 01:08:52,667
And I went clearly crazy

687
01:08:52,750 --> 01:08:55,712
Because I really craved for

688
01:08:55,795 --> 01:08:58,089
Chocolate-flavored treats

689
01:08:59,257 --> 01:09:02,510
Black boys are nutritious

690
01:09:02,593 --> 01:09:05,346
- Black boys fill me up
- Up

691
01:09:05,430 --> 01:09:09,350
Black boys are so damn yummy

692
01:09:09,434 --> 01:09:11,769
They satisfy my tummy

693
01:09:18,318 --> 01:09:19,986
- Black
- Black

694
01:09:21,654 --> 01:09:24,490
Black boys

695
01:09:28,369 --> 01:09:32,206
White boys are so pretty

696
01:09:32,290 --> 01:09:34,792
Skin as smooth as milk

697
01:09:39,380 --> 01:09:42,008
Hair like Chinese silk

698
01:09:43,134 --> 01:09:46,763
White boys give me goose bumps

699
01:09:46,804 --> 01:09:49,849
White boys give me chills

700
01:09:49,932 --> 01:09:53,853
When they touch my shoulder

701
01:09:53,936 --> 01:09:55,688
That's the touch that kills

702
01:09:56,939 --> 01:10:00,777
- My mother calls them lily
- Mama says lilies

703
01:10:00,818 --> 01:10:04,072
- I call them picadillies
- Picadillies

704
01:10:04,155 --> 01:10:07,575
- My daddy wants me to stay away
- Daddy

705
01:10:07,658 --> 01:10:10,995
But I say come and play

706
01:10:11,079 --> 01:10:13,664
White boys are so groovy

707
01:10:14,832 --> 01:10:17,502
White boys are so tough

708
01:10:18,336 --> 01:10:22,256
Every time they're near me

709
01:10:22,340 --> 01:10:23,966
Just can't get enough

710
01:10:25,218 --> 01:10:27,720
White boys are so sexy

711
01:10:27,804 --> 01:10:29,096
Sexy

712
01:10:29,180 --> 01:10:32,016
They're so long and lean

713
01:10:32,058 --> 01:10:36,312
Love those sprayed-on trousers

714
01:10:36,395 --> 01:10:37,855
I love the love machine

715
01:10:39,357 --> 01:10:41,901
My brother calls them rubble

716
01:10:43,528 --> 01:10:45,530
They're my kind of trouble

717
01:10:47,365 --> 01:10:49,617
My daddy warns me no, no, no

718
01:10:49,700 --> 01:10:53,913
But I say white boys go, go, go

719
01:10:53,996 --> 01:10:56,541
White boys are so lovely

720
01:10:57,500 --> 01:10:59,919
Beautiful as girls

721
01:11:00,878 --> 01:11:04,507
Love to run my fingers

722
01:11:04,549 --> 01:11:06,467
And toes
through all their curls

723
01:11:06,551 --> 01:11:08,636
Give me a tall

724
01:11:08,719 --> 01:11:10,263
- A lean
- A sexy

725
01:11:10,346 --> 01:11:12,181
- A pretty
- A groovy

726
01:11:12,265 --> 01:11:14,016
A juicy white boy

727
01:11:14,058 --> 01:11:16,727
Yeah, give me a white boy

728
01:11:16,811 --> 01:11:19,814
- White boys
- Yeah

729
01:11:19,897 --> 01:11:23,693
White boys, come on
and lie down beside me

730
01:12:08,612 --> 01:12:12,199
Doors locked

731
01:12:21,375 --> 01:12:25,463
Blinds pulled

732
01:12:34,180 --> 01:12:37,975
- Lights low
- Move it!

733
01:12:47,485 --> 01:12:50,029
Flames high

734
01:12:59,163 --> 01:13:02,625
My body

735
01:13:30,444 --> 01:13:34,990
My body is walking

736
01:13:35,032 --> 01:13:39,620
In space

737
01:13:39,703 --> 01:13:43,624
My soul is in orbit

738
01:13:43,707 --> 01:13:48,379
With God face-to-face

739
01:13:48,462 --> 01:13:52,550
Floating, flipping

740
01:13:52,633 --> 01:13:57,054
Flying, tripping

741
01:13:57,137 --> 01:14:01,100
Tripping from Pottsville

742
01:14:01,183 --> 01:14:05,354
To starlight

743
01:14:05,437 --> 01:14:09,608
Tripping from starlight

744
01:14:09,692 --> 01:14:14,530
To moonville

745
01:14:14,572 --> 01:14:17,950
Red black, Blue brown

746
01:14:19,952 --> 01:14:23,163
- Yellow crimson, Green orange
- Trainee.

747
01:14:25,165 --> 01:14:26,625
Purple pink

748
01:14:27,835 --> 01:14:29,253
Violet white

749
01:14:30,796 --> 01:14:32,089
White white

750
01:14:38,554 --> 01:14:41,223
All the clouds are cumulus

751
01:14:41,307 --> 01:14:44,351
Walking in space

752
01:14:44,435 --> 01:14:46,729
Oh, my God, your skin is soft

753
01:14:46,770 --> 01:14:49,857
I love your face

754
01:14:49,940 --> 01:14:52,151
How dare they try

755
01:14:52,234 --> 01:14:54,612
To end this beauty

756
01:15:00,784 --> 01:15:02,411
They keep us underfoot

757
01:15:02,494 --> 01:15:06,290
They bury us in soot

758
01:15:06,332 --> 01:15:08,626
Pretending it's our chore

759
01:15:08,709 --> 01:15:11,712
They ship us off to war

760
01:15:11,795 --> 01:15:17,217
In this dive
we rediscover sensation

761
01:15:22,473 --> 01:15:27,811
Walking in space
we find the purpose of peace

762
01:15:27,853 --> 01:15:30,147
The beauty of life

763
01:15:30,230 --> 01:15:32,232
You can no longer hide

764
01:15:33,692 --> 01:15:35,819
Our eyes are open

765
01:15:44,495 --> 01:15:46,997
Wide

766
01:16:25,035 --> 01:16:27,162
How you doing?

767
01:16:27,204 --> 01:16:29,498
- I'm all right.
- Yeah?

768
01:16:29,540 --> 01:16:32,334
Look, I've got something.

769
01:16:55,107 --> 01:16:56,733
Where is he?

770
01:16:58,402 --> 01:17:00,237
Nevada.

771
01:17:06,326 --> 01:17:10,581
So, I was thinking
of writing him.

772
01:17:10,664 --> 01:17:14,168
- What do you think I should say?
- I want to say something.

773
01:17:14,251 --> 01:17:19,214
Tell him that--
I want to say that Jeannie says hi.

774
01:17:22,467 --> 01:17:24,845
You're gonna write him?

775
01:17:24,928 --> 01:17:26,680
Why don't you come with us?

776
01:17:27,848 --> 01:17:30,642
- Where are you going?
- Nevada.

777
01:17:32,019 --> 01:17:33,604
We are?

778
01:17:35,272 --> 01:17:37,816
Aren't you serious about anything?

779
01:17:37,900 --> 01:17:39,693
I'm always serious.

780
01:17:39,776 --> 01:17:41,528
When are we going?

781
01:17:41,612 --> 01:17:43,196
As soon as Sheila's ready.

782
01:17:45,949 --> 01:17:49,411
I can't just take off
and go to Nevada.

783
01:17:49,494 --> 01:17:51,163
I guess not.

784
01:17:51,246 --> 01:17:54,708
- We'll see you.
- Wait a minute.

785
01:18:01,632 --> 01:18:04,468
- How will you get there?
- Car.

786
01:18:05,969 --> 01:18:09,890
- You don't have a car.
- I'm gonna get a car.

787
01:18:09,932 --> 01:18:15,145
- Lafayette?
- How will you get a car?

788
01:18:15,228 --> 01:18:16,855
What are you staring at?

789
01:18:25,989 --> 01:18:27,908
And who's that?

790
01:18:27,991 --> 01:18:30,077
What are you doing here?
Come on.

791
01:18:30,160 --> 01:18:32,245
- I said come with me.
- I heard you.

792
01:18:32,329 --> 01:18:34,998
I'm asking you,
who is that woman?

793
01:18:36,958 --> 01:18:40,962
- Are you a friend of my Lafayette?
- I ain't Lafayette no more.

794
01:18:41,046 --> 01:18:44,508
- Don't bother her, all right?
- What have you done to your head?

795
01:18:44,549 --> 01:18:48,553
Never mind.
Just go on back home.

796
01:18:51,264 --> 01:18:52,683
Is that his child?

797
01:18:55,435 --> 01:18:58,897
- Don't be talking to her.
- Is that your child?

798
01:19:01,108 --> 01:19:02,567
You wouldn't understand.

799
01:19:04,945 --> 01:19:08,031
What do you mean?
ls that your child or isn't it?

800
01:19:08,115 --> 01:19:09,908
What kind of question is that?

801
01:19:09,950 --> 01:19:12,411
Maybe it is and maybe it isn't.

802
01:19:12,452 --> 01:19:14,079
What?

803
01:19:14,121 --> 01:19:16,706
I knew you wouldn't understand.
You don't understand anything.

804
01:19:16,790 --> 01:19:19,918
I understand just fine.
You explain it to me.

805
01:19:19,960 --> 01:19:22,921
Do you understand about cosmic
consciousness and all that shit?

806
01:19:22,963 --> 01:19:24,965
That's what I'm talking about, baby.

807
01:19:25,006 --> 01:19:29,261
All I'm talking about
is Lafayette Junior here is your child.

808
01:19:29,302 --> 01:19:31,847
I just want to know
if that's your child too.

809
01:19:38,770 --> 01:19:41,314
Never mind that.
Come on!

810
01:19:41,398 --> 01:19:43,316
- Where are we going?
- I'm taking you to the bus.

811
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:45,694
- You're going back home.
- I don't want to go home!

812
01:19:46,945 --> 01:19:49,197
You're going back home.
Understand me?

813
01:19:50,449 --> 01:19:53,535
- I want to stay with you.
- You can't.

814
01:19:53,618 --> 01:19:57,372
- Why not?
- Because you can't. I said so.

815
01:20:02,294 --> 01:20:06,381
Look, we've got a friend in trouble,
and we have to help him.

816
01:20:06,464 --> 01:20:10,552
Baby, that's all you need to know.
Why don't you just go home?

817
01:20:10,635 --> 01:20:13,054
I never said you couldn't
help your friends, Lafayette.

818
01:20:13,138 --> 01:20:16,057
Goddamn it, woman!
I ain't no Lafayette!

819
01:20:16,141 --> 01:20:18,226
Shit!
Don't you understand nothing?

820
01:20:33,074 --> 01:20:36,661
How can people

821
01:20:36,745 --> 01:20:39,956
Be so heartless

822
01:20:41,249 --> 01:20:43,710
How can people

823
01:20:43,752 --> 01:20:46,379
Be so cruel

824
01:20:46,463 --> 01:20:51,509
Easy to be hard

825
01:20:53,595 --> 01:20:59,059
Easy to be cold

826
01:21:02,270 --> 01:21:05,357
How can people

827
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:08,818
Have no feelings

828
01:21:11,404 --> 01:21:13,990
You know I'm hung up on you

829
01:21:15,283 --> 01:21:19,871
Easy to be proud

830
01:21:21,790 --> 01:21:27,379
Easy to say no

831
01:21:30,882 --> 01:21:33,677
Especially people

832
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:37,847
Who care about strangers

833
01:21:37,889 --> 01:21:40,684
Who care about evil

834
01:21:40,767 --> 01:21:45,522
And social injustice

835
01:21:45,605 --> 01:21:47,857
Do you only

836
01:21:47,899 --> 01:21:51,861
Care about the bleeding crowd

837
01:21:51,945 --> 01:21:56,574
How about a needing friend

838
01:21:57,492 --> 01:22:01,371
I need a friend

839
01:22:10,797 --> 01:22:15,218
How can they ignore their friends

840
01:22:15,260 --> 01:22:19,055
Easy to give in

841
01:22:21,933 --> 01:22:27,814
Easy to help out

842
01:22:37,907 --> 01:22:41,161
Who say they care about

843
01:22:41,244 --> 01:22:43,663
Social injustice

844
01:24:43,616 --> 01:24:45,034
Hi, Steve.

845
01:24:47,412 --> 01:24:48,830
Come out of the car.

846
01:24:50,498 --> 01:24:55,461
- I just want to talk to you.
- You want to talk? Talk.

847
01:24:55,545 --> 01:24:58,339
I'd like to talk to you outside.

848
01:25:00,925 --> 01:25:02,677
I don't want to talk to you.

849
01:25:22,822 --> 01:25:26,200
Don't worry about a thing.
I'll handle this.

850
01:25:33,708 --> 01:25:35,376
- What do you want?
- The keys.

851
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:40,381
Cool out, baby.

852
01:25:40,465 --> 01:25:43,968
- You're taking the car?
- Just for a few days.

853
01:25:44,051 --> 01:25:45,803
- Coming with us?
- No, I'm not going with you!

854
01:25:45,887 --> 01:25:47,597
- All right.
- Sheila, come on.

855
01:25:47,680 --> 01:25:50,516
Out of the car. What--

856
01:25:56,397 --> 01:25:58,399
I'm not into any heavy
preference trip...

857
01:25:58,483 --> 01:26:00,651
Iike who the father is.

858
01:26:00,735 --> 01:26:03,029
I don't care.
I think they're both beautiful.

859
01:26:03,112 --> 01:26:05,323
Don't you?

860
01:26:05,364 --> 01:26:07,575
But how can you not care
about that?

861
01:26:09,577 --> 01:26:14,499
If a woman carries a child, don't you
think she should know who the father is?

862
01:26:14,582 --> 01:26:17,335
I admit that I have this dilemma.

863
01:26:17,418 --> 01:26:19,378
But it will be resolved real soon.

864
01:26:19,420 --> 01:26:23,758
It's not like a big crisis or anything.
It's not like a world war.

865
01:26:23,841 --> 01:26:27,011
I don't know
what you're so uptight about.

866
01:26:27,094 --> 01:26:28,679
I fell in love with someone.

867
01:26:28,763 --> 01:26:30,848
We had a child,
and we were gonna get married.

868
01:26:30,932 --> 01:26:32,475
That's why I'm uptight.

869
01:26:32,558 --> 01:26:34,602
- Yeah?
- And you're holding it up!

870
01:26:34,685 --> 01:26:36,687
I'm not holding it up.

871
01:26:36,771 --> 01:26:39,357
You don't see the way it is.

872
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:42,693
This is really a great thing
that's happened to all of us.

873
01:26:42,777 --> 01:26:46,239
Everybody's really happy about it.
The guys are really happy.

874
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:50,785
I think it would be great
if you could be happy about it too.

875
01:26:51,786 --> 01:26:54,247
- You're crazy.
- Yeah, I'm crazy.

876
01:26:54,288 --> 01:26:55,873
We're all crazy.
Let's shake on it.

877
01:26:57,291 --> 01:26:58,876
Let's not.

878
01:27:08,469 --> 01:27:09,929
Come on.

879
01:27:45,464 --> 01:27:49,510
If all you men could be standing
where I'm standing...

880
01:27:49,593 --> 01:27:52,388
and seeing what I'm seeing...

881
01:27:52,430 --> 01:27:56,809
you'd know how it feels
to be truly proud of our country.

882
01:27:56,851 --> 01:27:59,061
The United States Army...

883
01:27:59,145 --> 01:28:01,689
is the greatest fighting force
in the world.

884
01:28:02,815 --> 01:28:04,775
And now, you men...

885
01:28:04,859 --> 01:28:10,114
are going to be thousands of miles
away from home in a few days.

886
01:28:10,197 --> 01:28:13,951
You'd better take some
of that greatness with you.

887
01:28:15,327 --> 01:28:17,580
And this afternoon,
while you're on leave...

888
01:28:17,663 --> 01:28:20,374
you'd better take some of it
with you too.

889
01:29:13,302 --> 01:29:14,720
Sergeant!

890
01:29:16,138 --> 01:29:18,390
Shut the damn thing off!

891
01:29:18,474 --> 01:29:21,602
Ripped open

892
01:29:21,685 --> 01:29:26,106
By metal explosion

893
01:29:26,190 --> 01:29:32,071
Caught in barbed wire fireball

894
01:29:32,154 --> 01:29:34,198
Bullet shock

895
01:29:34,281 --> 01:29:38,202
Bayonet

896
01:29:38,244 --> 01:29:40,496
- Electricity
- What do I turn off?

897
01:29:40,579 --> 01:29:42,039
Move out!

898
01:29:50,089 --> 01:29:53,926
- Electronic
- Attention!

899
01:29:53,968 --> 01:29:56,011
Data

900
01:29:56,095 --> 01:29:58,055
Processing

901
01:29:58,097 --> 01:30:00,391
Black uniforms

902
01:30:00,474 --> 01:30:04,019
- Company!
- Attention!

903
01:30:05,646 --> 01:30:09,316
Mail order

904
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:11,026
Rifles

905
01:30:11,110 --> 01:30:14,071
Get some results!

906
01:30:20,953 --> 01:30:25,416
Two hundred

907
01:30:25,499 --> 01:30:27,418
And fifty-six

908
01:30:27,459 --> 01:30:29,420
Vietcong

909
01:30:29,461 --> 01:30:34,341
Captured

910
01:30:52,609 --> 01:30:55,029
Prisoners in Niggertown

911
01:30:55,112 --> 01:30:57,573
It's a dirty little war

912
01:30:57,656 --> 01:31:01,577
Three, five, zero, zero

913
01:31:03,412 --> 01:31:05,039
Take weapons up

914
01:31:05,122 --> 01:31:07,166
And begin to kill

915
01:31:07,249 --> 01:31:11,045
Watch the long, long armies
drifting home

916
01:31:48,582 --> 01:31:50,000
Everybody out!

917
01:32:12,105 --> 01:32:15,150
- Company!
- Attention!

918
01:32:22,449 --> 01:32:25,285
Now can all you men hear me?

919
01:32:35,254 --> 01:32:39,216
Good morning, starshine

920
01:32:39,299 --> 01:32:41,844
The Earth says hello

921
01:32:41,927 --> 01:32:45,848
You twinkle above us

922
01:32:45,889 --> 01:32:48,684
We twinkle below

923
01:32:52,729 --> 01:32:56,108
You lead us along

924
01:32:56,191 --> 01:33:00,279
My love and me
as we sing

925
01:33:00,362 --> 01:33:04,032
Our early morning singing song

926
01:34:12,559 --> 01:34:16,355
Singing a song
Humming a song

927
01:34:19,316 --> 01:34:22,486
Loving a song
Laughing a song

928
01:34:26,448 --> 01:34:29,701
Sing a song
Song a sing

929
01:34:29,785 --> 01:34:34,748
Song, song, song
Sing, sing, sing, sing, song

930
01:35:06,029 --> 01:35:08,240
- Hi.
- What can I do for you?

931
01:35:08,323 --> 01:35:10,158
We're going in.

932
01:35:10,200 --> 01:35:14,204
There's no civilian contact allowed
on the base right now. We're on alert.

933
01:35:14,287 --> 01:35:17,666
We're not civilians.
We're friends of a guy on the base.

934
01:35:17,749 --> 01:35:19,376
You probably know him.
He's a private.

935
01:35:19,417 --> 01:35:21,211
- I don't know him.
- Really nice guy with blonde hair.

936
01:35:21,294 --> 01:35:22,838
- He's short.
- I don't know him...

937
01:35:22,921 --> 01:35:26,258
but you'll still have to turn
your vehicle around and go off post.

938
01:35:26,341 --> 01:35:29,511
If you need some help,
I'll be glad to assist you.

939
01:35:29,594 --> 01:35:31,513
Otherwise, back your vehicle up
and turn it around.

940
01:35:31,596 --> 01:35:33,807
Listen, we don't want
to make any trouble.

941
01:35:33,890 --> 01:35:36,810
- Turn around and you won't.
- Just let me make a phone call.

942
01:35:36,893 --> 01:35:40,438
You don't make it here.
You make it where I tell you to go.

943
01:35:40,522 --> 01:35:43,608
You just said you wanted
to give me some assistance.

944
01:35:43,692 --> 01:35:45,735
I'll help you turn around.
That's all.

945
01:35:46,736 --> 01:35:49,489
- You don't understand--
- Chief, this is it.

946
01:35:49,573 --> 01:35:53,368
Turn around and go.
We clear?

947
01:35:54,578 --> 01:35:58,081
- You get my drift?
- You don't understand, man.

948
01:35:58,164 --> 01:36:00,959
- You don't understand.
- We've driven five days straight!

949
01:36:01,001 --> 01:36:03,795
- Listen, my man--
- I just want to see my friend.

950
01:36:03,879 --> 01:36:05,797
I'm telling you
to get the hell off my post.

951
01:36:05,881 --> 01:36:08,592
Turn around and go that way.
That's what I'm telling you.

952
01:36:08,675 --> 01:36:10,552
You listen to me.
I'm not listening to you. Got that?

953
01:36:18,768 --> 01:36:21,271
Thank you.
Have a nice day.

954
01:36:35,702 --> 01:36:37,954
- What's your name?
- George.

955
01:36:40,790 --> 01:36:44,544
- What's yours?
- Sheila.

956
01:36:44,628 --> 01:36:46,046
Yeah?

957
01:36:47,297 --> 01:36:50,925
- Is your husband on base?
- I'm not married.

958
01:36:53,053 --> 01:36:54,804
I'm visiting my brother.

959
01:37:06,441 --> 01:37:07,984
Wait a minute.

960
01:37:08,068 --> 01:37:10,111
Okay, this time I'll do it.

961
01:37:14,157 --> 01:37:16,785
That was a good one.
Let me do that again.

962
01:37:21,414 --> 01:37:22,916
I'll blow one,
and then you blow one...

963
01:37:22,999 --> 01:37:26,086
and see if they can,
you know--

964
01:37:26,169 --> 01:37:27,962
You blow one
through one of mine.

965
01:37:48,441 --> 01:37:50,360
Very good.

966
01:38:01,079 --> 01:38:03,915
Where is your car?

967
01:38:03,998 --> 01:38:05,417
Right over there.

968
01:39:00,805 --> 01:39:02,765
God Almighty.

969
01:39:23,578 --> 01:39:24,913
Let's pull over there.

970
01:39:27,373 --> 01:39:30,960
Let's stop here.
Company, halt.

971
01:39:34,255 --> 01:39:37,592
- Dismissed.
- "Dismissed"?

972
01:39:41,137 --> 01:39:43,473
You cutie-pie!

973
01:39:47,685 --> 01:39:50,313
Come here, my cutie!

974
01:39:52,148 --> 01:39:53,566
That's my hat!

975
01:40:05,078 --> 01:40:08,247
What are you doing?

976
01:40:11,584 --> 01:40:13,086
Hey, baby!

977
01:41:22,738 --> 01:41:24,198
How do I look?

978
01:41:30,246 --> 01:41:31,914
Very authentic.

979
01:43:25,695 --> 01:43:27,697
Company!

980
01:43:39,542 --> 01:43:41,502
- Yes, Sergeant.
- Let's move it out.

981
01:43:42,795 --> 01:43:44,588
Double-time, soldier.

982
01:43:52,847 --> 01:43:56,726
- Sir?
- In the car, soldier!

983
01:43:56,767 --> 01:43:59,061
- Are you an asshole, soldier?
- No, Sergeant.

984
01:43:59,103 --> 01:44:01,522
That's too bad,
because I am.

985
01:44:06,777 --> 01:44:08,696
How you doing, man?

986
01:44:11,615 --> 01:44:14,410
I want to be an Air Force major

987
01:44:14,493 --> 01:44:17,496
I want to live a life of danger

988
01:44:21,250 --> 01:44:23,502
- Stay in the car.
- What are you doing?

989
01:44:39,351 --> 01:44:41,937
- Get in the trunk.
- What?

990
01:44:41,979 --> 01:44:44,231
- Get in the trunk quick.
- Why?

991
01:44:46,233 --> 01:44:49,069
Everybody's waiting. We have a big
picnic planned for you in the desert.

992
01:44:49,153 --> 01:44:51,947
- Come on, get in.
- The base is on alert.

993
01:44:52,031 --> 01:44:55,701
They're taking head counts all the time.
If I'm not here, I've had it.

994
01:44:58,287 --> 01:45:01,540
It's just for a couple of hours.
I'll have you back in time for dinner.

995
01:45:01,624 --> 01:45:05,044
- I can't.
- What do you mean?

996
01:45:05,127 --> 01:45:08,547
We just drove 2,000 miles to see you.
Everybody is waiting.

997
01:45:08,631 --> 01:45:12,009
Just trust me.
I have it all figured out.

998
01:45:12,092 --> 01:45:13,802
You're making it sound
like I don't want to come.

999
01:45:13,886 --> 01:45:15,971
Then come.
Get in the trunk.

1000
01:45:27,650 --> 01:45:30,653
I can't believe you're here.

1001
01:45:30,736 --> 01:45:32,613
I just can't believe it.
Traveling all that way?

1002
01:45:38,285 --> 01:45:40,204
I appreciate your coming here.

1003
01:45:43,874 --> 01:45:45,793
I can't tell you.

1004
01:45:47,169 --> 01:45:50,631
Don't tell me, just come with us.
Just get in the trunk.

1005
01:45:50,714 --> 01:45:53,425
You don't understand.
This isn't a game.

1006
01:46:00,349 --> 01:46:01,767
What will I tell everybody?

1007
01:46:05,396 --> 01:46:08,774
- Did Sheila come?
- Yeah.

1008
01:46:10,109 --> 01:46:14,363
- And Jeannie?
- Everybody is there, man.

1009
01:46:15,906 --> 01:46:18,200
How is Sheila?

1010
01:46:29,378 --> 01:46:31,422
What are you doing?

1011
01:46:38,095 --> 01:46:40,014
Give me your clothes.

1012
01:48:16,151 --> 01:48:17,819
Attention!

1013
01:48:41,134 --> 01:48:42,678
At ease!

1014
01:48:42,761 --> 01:48:45,013
Sound off when your name is called.

1015
01:48:46,348 --> 01:48:47,307
Here, sir.

1016
01:50:11,224 --> 01:50:14,144
Give me your attention, men.

1017
01:50:14,186 --> 01:50:18,065
I just received word we've been
alerted for overseas movement.

1018
01:50:19,983 --> 01:50:22,652
I want you to secure your web gear,
get your duffle bags packed...

1019
01:50:22,736 --> 01:50:24,863
and get on this red line.

1020
01:50:24,946 --> 01:50:27,699
Sergeant, you have three minutes
to have these men ready.

1021
01:50:27,783 --> 01:50:30,452
Let's go, men.
Move with a purpose.

1022
01:50:35,791 --> 01:50:37,918
Let's get it all quickly.

1023
01:50:38,001 --> 01:50:39,795
Let's snap to it
like you got a pair.

1024
01:50:39,878 --> 01:50:41,797
Let's go. Move it, quickly.

1025
01:50:41,838 --> 01:50:43,799
Get on the red line.
Get your duffle bag packed.

1026
01:50:43,882 --> 01:50:45,592
Let's go over there.

1027
01:50:45,675 --> 01:50:47,636
What the hell's wrong with you,
soldier?

1028
01:50:47,719 --> 01:50:49,930
Didn't you hear
what the captain said?

1029
01:50:50,013 --> 01:50:52,140
Get your helmet liner!
Get your pistol belt!

1030
01:50:52,224 --> 01:50:54,518
Get it right now!
Let's move like you got a purpose!

1031
01:50:54,601 --> 01:50:57,354
Get the doggone coat on!
Quickly! Let's go! Move it!

1032
01:50:57,437 --> 01:51:00,398
I don't know what's the matter with you.
You act like you don't want to go.

1033
01:51:00,482 --> 01:51:03,485
I don't want to go, but if you have to
go, I have to go. We all have to go.

1034
01:51:03,568 --> 01:51:05,821
So let's move it right now!

1035
01:51:05,904 --> 01:51:10,116
Let's get on the red line.
Let's go.

1036
01:51:12,244 --> 01:51:13,995
What are you waiting on?

1037
01:51:14,079 --> 01:51:17,082
Get that web gear on!
I want that brain bucket on your head!

1038
01:51:17,165 --> 01:51:20,335
I want that duffle bag on the red line!
Soldier, there's a war on!

1039
01:51:44,818 --> 01:51:46,278
Listen up!

1040
01:51:46,361 --> 01:51:50,865
When I call your name,
sound off smartly and move out!

1041
01:51:51,575 --> 01:51:53,118
Yes, sir!

1042
01:52:05,630 --> 01:52:08,633
You better get your head
out of your ass! Let's go!

1043
01:52:08,717 --> 01:52:11,428
This way, soldier!
Move out!

1044
01:52:11,511 --> 01:52:13,513
You better move, soldier!

1045
01:52:23,606 --> 01:52:25,442
Where are you going!

1046
01:52:25,525 --> 01:52:28,737
What's the matter with you? I said
put your duffle bag on that truck!

1047
01:52:28,778 --> 01:52:33,366
The vehicle right there!
Get it on there now!

1048
01:52:54,179 --> 01:52:56,890
We starve look

1049
01:52:56,973 --> 01:52:58,475
At one another

1050
01:52:58,558 --> 01:52:59,601
Short of breath

1051
01:52:59,684 --> 01:53:04,147
Walking proudly
in our winter coats

1052
01:53:04,230 --> 01:53:08,151
Wearing smells
from laboratories

1053
01:53:08,234 --> 01:53:11,446
Facing a dying nation

1054
01:53:12,530 --> 01:53:17,202
Of moving paper fantasies

1055
01:53:17,285 --> 01:53:20,371
Listening for the new-told lies

1056
01:53:21,289 --> 01:53:23,708
With supreme visions

1057
01:53:23,792 --> 01:53:26,544
Of lonely tunes

1058
01:53:26,628 --> 01:53:28,880
Somewhere

1059
01:53:28,963 --> 01:53:30,882
Inside something there is

1060
01:53:30,965 --> 01:53:33,468
A rush of

1061
01:53:33,551 --> 01:53:38,014
Greatness
Who knows what stands in front of

1062
01:53:38,056 --> 01:53:41,643
Our lives
I fashion my future

1063
01:53:41,726 --> 01:53:43,770
On films in space

1064
01:53:43,853 --> 01:53:48,817
Silence tells me secretly

1065
01:53:48,900 --> 01:53:52,987
Everything

1066
01:55:17,238 --> 01:55:20,366
Singing our space songs

1067
01:55:20,408 --> 01:55:24,037
On a spider web sitar

1068
01:55:24,078 --> 01:55:28,541
Life is around you and in you

1069
01:55:28,625 --> 01:55:32,462
Answer for Timothy Leary

1070
01:55:32,545 --> 01:55:34,797
Dearie

1071
01:55:34,881 --> 01:55:39,469
Let the sun shine

1072
01:55:39,552 --> 01:55:43,306
Let the sun shine in

1073
01:56:00,740 --> 01:56:05,328
Why don't you let the sun shine

1074
01:56:05,411 --> 01:56:09,624
Just let the sun shine in

1075
01:56:18,591 --> 01:56:23,346
You ought to let the sun shine in
