1
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:25,460
Look at me! Calm down!

2
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,464
What happened to the others?
Look at me!

3
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:32,217
Fuckin' dead! The whole platoon!

4
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:35,846
The sarge totally lost it.
Went nuts. Killed everyone.

5
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:38,098
Get off me!

6
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:42,978
They're all dead! Oh fucking God!
Ah, you son of a bitch!

7
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:46,190
Let's get outta here!

8
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:49,276
Come on!

9
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:51,361
Luc, come on, man!

10
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,180
Sarge?

11
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:48,353
What the hell happened here?

12
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,990
They wouldn't listen.

13
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:05,412
The village was cleared.
These people are innocent.

14
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:12,503
They're all fuckin' traitors. You turn
around, they stab you in the back.

15
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,004
Sarge...

16
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,925
My tour is up.

17
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:20,677
I just want to go home.

18
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:23,263
Come on. Let's go home.

19
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:29,061
You're just like the others.
You just want to leave.

20
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:32,856
Like none of this shit ever happened.

21
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,610
It happened!

22
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:41,156
And it doesn't just go away.
You just can't walk away!

23
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:46,453
Do you hear me?

24
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:57,256
You're a traitor, too,
aren't you, farm boy?

25
00:04:57,756 --> 00:04:58,924
No.

26
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:02,928
Prove it!

27
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:05,848
Kill her!

28
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:09,101
Kill the motherfucking traitor!

29
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,562
That's an order!

30
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,404
Get up, come on!

31
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:26,827
Come on!

32
00:05:33,876 --> 00:05:34,668
Run!

33
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,142
No!

34
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:18,730
What the... Oh Jesus Christ!

35
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:21,483
Nice touch.

36
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:25,487
I'd hate to be the poor schmuck
who has to explain this to Ma and Pa.

37
00:07:26,989 --> 00:07:30,784
Sir, how do we write this one up?
What do we say happened?

38
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:36,039
Nothing. Nothing happened here. M. I.A.
We didn't find anyone. Understood?

39
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:39,751
What? They're gonna call this M. I.A.?

40
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:45,132
Lincoln, this is Eagle. Come in.
I've got a code Zebra, do you copy?

41
00:07:45,591 --> 00:07:49,636
Only a few hours ago.
At least ten bodies... Yes, sir.

42
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:51,388
Pack 'em in ice.

43
00:07:55,601 --> 00:07:56,643
Ice...

44
00:10:46,355 --> 00:10:47,189
Alright.

45
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:49,149
How's the picture?

46
00:10:51,944 --> 00:10:54,112
Pretty ugly.
- Very funny.

47
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:55,739
Very funny.

48
00:10:56,198 --> 00:10:57,449
I need a ladder.

49
00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:01,662
Can you see me? How's my hair?

50
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,330
Let's go.

51
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:08,168
Alright, my size, yeah!
- Systems, check.

52
00:11:08,627 --> 00:11:09,878
Next!

53
00:11:12,256 --> 00:11:15,509
How's the focus?
- Check.

54
00:11:15,968 --> 00:11:18,887
Good, let's go. Okay brother, go.

55
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:22,266
Alright, so we got 'em all.

56
00:11:22,683 --> 00:11:24,476
We don't have much time.

57
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:59,052
Position 7, status?
- They're bringing the next one out.

58
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:13,859
Excuse me. I'll have a statement
for you later on, okay? Thank you.

59
00:12:15,611 --> 00:12:17,529
They just killed another hostage.

60
00:12:17,988 --> 00:12:21,700
Current status? - They're
all linked to an intercom system.

61
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:36,507
They're in the water.

62
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:42,429
Colonel, where'd you drop 'em off?
- About a mile and a half away.

63
00:12:42,888 --> 00:12:45,140
1.5 miles? We got thirteen minutes!

64
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:50,395
Hurry up!

65
00:12:50,854 --> 00:12:52,189
Hold on, ma'am.

66
00:12:52,648 --> 00:12:55,901
I'm with the press. CNA.
They're waiting for me right there.

67
00:12:57,778 --> 00:13:00,614
I'm canceling the remote.
- Oh, Charles, will you relax!

68
00:13:01,073 --> 00:13:04,952
We're live in one minute!
- He's absolutely gonna kill me.

69
00:13:06,662 --> 00:13:08,330
See, there she is.

70
00:13:12,501 --> 00:13:15,003
I know, I'm running a little late.
- A little?

71
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:17,965
Well, that traffic killed me.
- We're live in twenty.

72
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:20,259
Where the hell were you?

73
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:22,719
See your mark?
- I got my mark.

74
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:25,347
Glasses!

75
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:27,224
Mic.

76
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,479
Nice shoes!
- No feet!

77
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,148
Cigarette!

78
00:13:36,775 --> 00:13:39,278
With 30 hostages
inside the power station,

79
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:43,782
the gunmen claim they will not
release any of them until

80
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:48,162
some comrades are released
from penitentiaries across the U. S.

81
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,497
Checkpoint 3, all clear.

82
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,834
Keep your eyes open.

83
00:13:57,671 --> 00:13:59,047
Shut up!

84
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:04,636
I said shut up!

85
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:09,725
Hey, do as you're told
and you won't get hurt. - Quiet down.

86
00:14:11,018 --> 00:14:13,103
Checkpoint 3, all clear.

87
00:14:23,113 --> 00:14:27,409
Colonel, they're at the tower.
- A mile and a half under 4 minutes?

88
00:14:29,161 --> 00:14:30,662
They're 8 seconds behind schedule.

89
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:33,499
Veronica Roberts, live for CNA.

90
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:35,626
And we're out.
- See, what'd I tell ya?

91
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:40,005
No problem. - The network
does not revolve around you!

92
00:14:40,464 --> 00:14:45,802
Are you saying I'm not the center of
the universe? - Don't get wise!

93
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,263
I always get you the story.

94
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:52,809
You think because you broke a few
stories that you're indispensable?

95
00:14:53,268 --> 00:14:58,232
Well, I had a chat with the network
today and you know what? - No, what?

96
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,275
You're fired.

97
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:10,702
They're in the drain-out tunnels.

98
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:19,336
GR-13, take aim and hold fire.

99
00:15:19,795 --> 00:15:22,130
Checkpoint 1, all clear.
- Checkpoint 2, all clear.

100
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:26,301
GR-44 is in position. Take aim.

101
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,136
Fire!

102
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:33,183
Move in and secure the objective.

103
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:35,143
Clear that image up.

104
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:37,145
Clear it.

105
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:39,815
Got it.

106
00:15:53,412 --> 00:15:55,247
Interceptors are secured and powered.

107
00:15:55,706 --> 00:15:58,917
Begin playback.
- Playback. - Rolling.

108
00:15:59,585 --> 00:16:01,962
Checkpoint 1, all clear.

109
00:16:02,421 --> 00:16:03,922
Checkpoint 2, all clear.

110
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:06,466
Checkpoint 3, all clear.

111
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:08,844
They're buying it.

112
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:17,144
Who the hell are these guys?

113
00:16:37,915 --> 00:16:38,957
Okay, here we go...

114
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,210
Terminate objectives.

115
00:16:47,508 --> 00:16:49,635
Activate interceptors now.

116
00:16:53,472 --> 00:16:56,475
I think homeboy likes this shit.
- Don't be ridiculous.

117
00:16:56,892 --> 00:17:00,521
Continue playback.
- Checkpoint 3, all clear.

118
00:17:13,158 --> 00:17:17,204
Okay, we're inside.
- Begin phase two. - Initiate.

119
00:17:27,506 --> 00:17:28,882
Look at this guy.

120
00:17:29,967 --> 00:17:32,636
Hold it there, buddy! Hold it!

121
00:17:34,346 --> 00:17:37,432
Two gunmen,
semi-automatic, fully loaded.

122
00:17:38,058 --> 00:17:42,229
Main target to rear. Loaded pistol
and explosives detonator.

123
00:17:42,646 --> 00:17:44,273
Shoot him!

124
00:17:56,827 --> 00:18:01,290
You are cleared, I repeat,
you are cleared to proceed.

125
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:21,226
GR-13,

126
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:24,354
all clear.
- No injuries?

127
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:26,982
Gentlemen, I think everybody's ok.

128
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:46,752
Arizona team.
- GR-44, status report?

129
00:18:49,713 --> 00:18:51,465
GR-44, do you read me?

130
00:18:52,216 --> 00:18:56,220
Problems? - He's not responding.
- Well, try another frequency.

131
00:18:56,678 --> 00:18:59,181
GR-44, status report, now!

132
00:19:00,224 --> 00:19:01,808
Kill the motherfuckin' traitor!

133
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:05,604
That's an order!

134
00:19:10,317 --> 00:19:12,069
GR-44, respond!

135
00:19:14,738 --> 00:19:18,575
How many UniSols were injured?
- Just who are these guys?

136
00:19:19,034 --> 00:19:21,078
I will address you accordingly.

137
00:19:21,537 --> 00:19:25,707
This marks the third successful
mission for the Universal Soldiers.

138
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:30,128
Again, without any casualties and
without any injuries.

139
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:33,632
As to the UniSols' identity,
that remains classified.

140
00:19:34,091 --> 00:19:38,720
But Colonel... - These men have
families. I won't jeopardize that.

141
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:41,974
Now I have
other matters to attend to.

142
00:19:42,432 --> 00:19:46,770
Lieutenant, could I have a statement?
- There'll be a briefing tonight.

143
00:19:47,229 --> 00:19:49,982
What are we doing here?
We need pictures.

144
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,901
Lieutenant, please, one statement!

145
00:20:01,285 --> 00:20:04,371
Huey, I have an idea.

146
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:05,873
No, you don't.

147
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:08,542
Yeah, I do.
- I hate when you do this.

148
00:20:17,885 --> 00:20:21,180
Ronnie, what are you doing?
This is too close!

149
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:23,473
They're gonna see us.

150
00:20:30,939 --> 00:20:34,193
We shouldn't be here.
- All these guards.

151
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:37,529
They must still be in there, huh?
- Yeah.

152
00:20:40,199 --> 00:20:43,494
Are you getting this?
- That's one hell of a mobile home.

153
00:20:55,589 --> 00:21:01,762
At 30 below, lowering to
final stage of 60, sub-zero.

154
00:21:02,721 --> 00:21:06,642
He just froze up. We can't figure
it out. - What do you mean?

155
00:21:07,059 --> 00:21:10,562
At the end of the mission
he became completely unresponsive.

156
00:21:11,021 --> 00:21:13,649
Did he overheat?
- He hardly broke a sweat.

157
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:15,776
GR-44,

158
00:21:17,569 --> 00:21:20,322
why did you not respond?

159
00:21:23,158 --> 00:21:24,326
What happened?

160
00:21:25,911 --> 00:21:27,037
Innocent...

161
00:21:28,455 --> 00:21:29,915
What do you mean?

162
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:35,796
The village was cleared.
That girl was innocent, Sarge.

163
00:21:36,255 --> 00:21:38,048
Sarge? Who is Sarge?

164
00:21:39,341 --> 00:21:42,427
That could be an old memory.

165
00:21:42,886 --> 00:21:45,138
We should take him out of the program

166
00:21:45,597 --> 00:21:47,891
until we find out
what's going on in his head.

167
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:50,143
GR-44 stays with the program.

168
00:21:50,602 --> 00:21:52,813
But, Colonel...
- He just got mixed up.

169
00:21:53,272 --> 00:21:55,607
Just give him the serum.

170
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:04,283
Okay, guys,

171
00:22:04,825 --> 00:22:06,535
memory clearance.

172
00:22:06,994 --> 00:22:10,164
Take your positions.
Activate injection.

173
00:22:30,267 --> 00:22:32,728
They're moving
something else onto the tarmac!

174
00:22:33,562 --> 00:22:36,440
We can't get anything from out here.
- Are you nuts?

175
00:22:36,899 --> 00:22:40,819
This is a classified military
operation. You can't get closer.

176
00:22:41,236 --> 00:22:43,030
I'll be right back.

177
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:53,957
You were confused.
- I was confused.

178
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:57,085
You must follow orders at all times.

179
00:22:58,212 --> 00:23:00,130
I must follow my orders.

180
00:23:00,589 --> 00:23:05,844
He's fine.
- If you say so. You're in charge.

181
00:23:23,237 --> 00:23:24,988
This is pretty bad.

182
00:23:25,864 --> 00:23:29,743
Soon as the floatation chamber's
filled, we'll have to put him in.

183
00:23:30,202 --> 00:23:31,370
Great.

184
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:39,002
I always have to do this part
and I hate it!

185
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:45,843
Hey, Dr. Haines! Dr. Haines!
Can I get a little help with this?

186
00:23:58,063 --> 00:23:58,897
Jesus!

187
00:23:59,898 --> 00:24:01,900
No casualties or injuries, huh?

188
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:06,738
Power up the cooling generators.
He's almost ready. - You got it.

189
00:24:08,198 --> 00:24:11,493
He's ready. - Bring him in.
- Yes, sir. - Thank you.

190
00:24:13,453 --> 00:24:15,956
Prepare for floatation chamber entry.

191
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:41,440
Colonel, we've spotted an intruder.

192
00:24:46,904 --> 00:24:50,782
Who the fuck is that?
She's taking pictures!

193
00:24:51,241 --> 00:24:55,412
Huey! - Shit! What the hell has she
done this time? - Start the car!

194
00:24:59,541 --> 00:25:01,418
I think we should leave now!

195
00:25:01,877 --> 00:25:05,339
What'd you get?
- Redemption. - Let's go!

196
00:25:25,234 --> 00:25:27,778
Do you think we lost 'em?

197
00:25:36,954 --> 00:25:38,413
How you doin'?

198
00:25:39,373 --> 00:25:40,874
Veronica Roberts,

199
00:25:42,125 --> 00:25:43,585
CNA.

200
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:48,131
You want to help me out?

201
00:25:51,718 --> 00:25:54,471
Thank you, thank... Hey, easy!

202
00:25:59,643 --> 00:26:00,769
Take it easy!

203
00:26:06,984 --> 00:26:07,901
You alright?

204
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:12,072
Okay, they got 'em. Bingo!

205
00:26:12,531 --> 00:26:15,993
I want to speak to someone in charge.

206
00:26:17,494 --> 00:26:19,621
You guys speak English?

207
00:26:20,164 --> 00:26:21,707
Awaiting instructions.

208
00:26:22,166 --> 00:26:25,502
Tell them to find that film
and bring those civilians back here.

209
00:26:25,961 --> 00:26:28,255
I'm sure we can handle this situation,

210
00:26:28,714 --> 00:26:32,551
if I can make a phone call.
- What's wrong with these guys?

211
00:26:34,928 --> 00:26:35,929
The film!

212
00:26:37,097 --> 00:26:38,056
Uh, fellas...

213
00:26:38,515 --> 00:26:39,558
I don't know...

214
00:26:40,017 --> 00:26:41,268
She didn't do anything!

215
00:26:44,605 --> 00:26:47,191
Christ! GR-13, cease fire!

216
00:26:47,649 --> 00:26:50,569
Do you read me?
Cease fire! I repeat:

217
00:26:51,695 --> 00:26:53,363
Cease fire!

218
00:26:53,822 --> 00:26:55,157
That's an order!

219
00:27:04,541 --> 00:27:07,920
No, no! Let go of me! Oh God!

220
00:27:08,921 --> 00:27:10,589
GR-86, visual!

221
00:27:11,423 --> 00:27:13,509
What the fuck is he doing?

222
00:27:13,967 --> 00:27:17,429
Stop the girl! Shoot if you have to.

223
00:27:22,601 --> 00:27:26,355
GR-44, stop the car! That is an order!

224
00:27:29,942 --> 00:27:32,569
He stopped the car.
- Cease fire!

225
00:27:33,028 --> 00:27:34,196
What are you doing?

226
00:27:34,655 --> 00:27:39,201
Come on, get out of here!
Jesus Christ, they're gonna kill us!

227
00:27:39,743 --> 00:27:44,122
GR-44, turn the car around.
- Are you deaf?

228
00:27:44,581 --> 00:27:47,000
You are simply confused.

229
00:27:47,543 --> 00:27:50,879
I am confused.
- What are you talking about! Go!

230
00:27:51,338 --> 00:27:55,759
Do not listen to her.
- What the hell is that thing?

231
00:27:56,218 --> 00:28:00,430
Do you hear me?
- Fucking stupid piece of shit!

232
00:28:00,889 --> 00:28:03,100
The bitch cut me off!

233
00:28:04,434 --> 00:28:06,436
I must follow orders.

234
00:28:07,187 --> 00:28:08,355
Bullshit!

235
00:28:08,814 --> 00:28:11,567
On the road!
- Oh, shit!

236
00:28:13,068 --> 00:28:15,404
Woodward, do something!

237
00:28:18,615 --> 00:28:19,741
Traitor!

238
00:28:25,581 --> 00:28:27,916
He didn't do anything!

239
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:32,546
Well, they're not gonna
get away with this shit.

240
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:35,799
Is he ready? - Almost.
- Take him out of the loop.

241
00:28:36,258 --> 00:28:40,721
He shot a man!
- I need every soldier I've got.

242
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,890
We're goin' after them.

243
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,601
Colonel Perry!

244
00:28:47,144 --> 00:28:49,479
We killed an innocent man.

245
00:28:49,897 --> 00:28:54,610
Should we let that reporter
run off with one of our UniSols?

246
00:28:55,068 --> 00:29:00,240
We can't just cover this up. We have
a moral obligation to tell the truth.

247
00:29:00,699 --> 00:29:04,244
I thought
you were more clever than that.

248
00:29:04,703 --> 00:29:07,539
This whole project is off the shelf.

249
00:29:07,998 --> 00:29:09,416
Do you think those

250
00:29:09,875 --> 00:29:16,548
wimps at the Pentagon would allow
the regeneration of dead soldiers?

251
00:29:17,466 --> 00:29:21,011
I don't think
I can be a part of this anymore.

252
00:29:21,678 --> 00:29:26,475
If this is uncovered now,
we're all going to jail. Understood?

253
00:29:32,481 --> 00:29:36,318
Why did you do that?
Why did you help me out?

254
00:29:37,402 --> 00:29:40,864
My tour's up. Just want to go home.

255
00:29:41,323 --> 00:29:45,744
But I can't until you're safe.
- What do you mean?

256
00:29:48,664 --> 00:29:50,749
My God! You've been shot!

257
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,754
Oh Jesus,
we've got to stop the bleeding!

258
00:29:57,172 --> 00:29:59,424
Oh God, that's gotta hurt you!

259
00:30:10,435 --> 00:30:11,854
The bleeding has stopped.

260
00:30:16,275 --> 00:30:18,527
Secure your positions!

261
00:30:19,653 --> 00:30:21,655
Secure and lock!

262
00:30:41,758 --> 00:30:43,093
Why are we stopping now?

263
00:30:43,552 --> 00:30:44,928
What happened?

264
00:30:45,387 --> 00:30:47,014
Out of gas.

265
00:30:51,727 --> 00:30:54,271
Sure, out of gas, why not?

266
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:55,689
Shit!

267
00:31:12,664 --> 00:31:13,707
Oh, God.

268
00:31:14,166 --> 00:31:16,502
Tracking system activated.

269
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,297
We've picked 'em up.
Moving due east, 7 miles ahead.

270
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:25,052
Estimated time of interception?
- 4 minutes. - 4 minutes and marking.

271
00:31:42,986 --> 00:31:44,530
How you doin'?

272
00:31:46,156 --> 00:31:50,160
You must be pretty tired
after all that pushing and stuff.

273
00:31:50,619 --> 00:31:54,122
Well, I'm gonna go.
I'll be right back.

274
00:31:55,916 --> 00:31:58,836
Where are you going?
- To make a phone call.

275
00:31:59,294 --> 00:32:00,587
You mind?

276
00:32:16,603 --> 00:32:17,729
Change...

277
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:33,328
I need some gas.

278
00:32:33,787 --> 00:32:39,001
We ran out of gas yesterday.
Refueling truck comes in the morning.

279
00:32:40,794 --> 00:32:43,422
You want to rent a room?

280
00:32:45,174 --> 00:32:46,466
Nice outfit.

281
00:32:47,134 --> 00:32:48,177
Shit!

282
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,555
Hey, you don't look so good.

283
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:58,896
I need to cool down.

284
00:32:59,354 --> 00:33:04,276
All our rooms have air conditioning.
I some with water beds.

285
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:08,614
Hey, the pay phone's out.

286
00:33:09,031 --> 00:33:12,534
All our rooms have telephones, too.
Only 50 dollars a night.

287
00:33:12,993 --> 00:33:15,496
I need a phone. What about this one?

288
00:33:15,954 --> 00:33:20,209
Sorry, that's for employees only.

289
00:33:38,393 --> 00:33:43,607
Since there's two of you, that's
double occupancy. Extra 10 dollars.

290
00:33:47,194 --> 00:33:50,781
And a matter of
a small 20 dollar security deposit.

291
00:33:52,032 --> 00:33:53,450
Of course, 20 dollars.

292
00:33:53,909 --> 00:33:55,786
Have a nice stay.

293
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,970
Great. Maybe there's
already something on the news.

294
00:34:38,662 --> 00:34:40,455
Commence UniSol deployment.

295
00:34:41,623 --> 00:34:45,752
B and C teams,
take supporting positions.

296
00:34:47,296 --> 00:34:52,259
GR-13, seek and destroy local
communications lines in target areas.

297
00:34:55,804 --> 00:35:00,309
...one prays for the speedy handling
of terrorist situations.

298
00:35:00,767 --> 00:35:04,563
In a related story, only hours
after the rescue at McKinley Dam,

299
00:35:05,022 --> 00:35:10,235
news reporters become news makers.
Reporting live, Chris Garvey.

300
00:35:10,736 --> 00:35:14,114
In a surprising development,
a CNA cameraman, Huey Taylor,

301
00:35:14,573 --> 00:35:17,534
was shot and killed
in a motel room in Eagle Rock City.

302
00:35:17,993 --> 00:35:20,746
Witnesses allege that
CNA correspondent Veronica Roberts

303
00:35:21,497 --> 00:35:25,667
shot him after an apparent argument.
Cocaine was found at the scene.

304
00:35:26,126 --> 00:35:27,336
No way.

305
00:35:29,421 --> 00:35:31,131
No way!

306
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:33,175
I don't believe this!

307
00:35:34,384 --> 00:35:36,428
They won't get away with this!

308
00:35:37,095 --> 00:35:39,223
You must return to your room.

309
00:35:41,183 --> 00:35:42,893
Mother, come here.

310
00:35:43,352 --> 00:35:46,772
There must be
a phone that works in this place.

311
00:35:47,231 --> 00:35:51,026
This area's not secure.
- You know, why don't you...

312
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:53,779
What are you doing?

313
00:35:54,905 --> 00:35:58,242
It's not safe for you out there.
- Where are your clothes?

314
00:35:59,535 --> 00:36:00,953
I have to...

315
00:36:02,454 --> 00:36:04,373
I have to cool down.

316
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:15,259
My God, you're burning up!

317
00:36:21,974 --> 00:36:24,726
I need... ice.

318
00:36:29,857 --> 00:36:31,441
Shame on ya

319
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:38,115
GR-13, continue advance.

320
00:36:39,283 --> 00:36:41,201
Target center structure.

321
00:36:46,874 --> 00:36:52,045
What is she doing with all that ice?
Maybe I should call the police.

322
00:36:52,713 --> 00:36:55,632
I've heard of cold showers before,
but this is ridiculous.

323
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:58,510
How you doin'?

324
00:37:00,095 --> 00:37:02,014
I got all the ice that I could.

325
00:37:03,724 --> 00:37:05,058
You okay?

326
00:37:07,936 --> 00:37:08,896
How's your...

327
00:37:13,233 --> 00:37:14,735
Your wound?

328
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:22,117
It's, it's healing!

329
00:37:22,576 --> 00:37:24,870
Well, I'm gonna...

330
00:37:25,329 --> 00:37:26,914
...make that phone call,

331
00:37:27,372 --> 00:37:29,875
and call a doctor...

332
00:37:31,585 --> 00:37:32,836
or something.

333
00:37:33,295 --> 00:37:34,922
Heat and infrared, check.

334
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:38,717
Munitions and firearms identifier,
powered and working.

335
00:37:39,176 --> 00:37:41,303
Don't even start with me, alright?

336
00:37:41,762 --> 00:37:44,264
And take this lock off. Goddamn it!

337
00:37:44,723 --> 00:37:47,309
Hey, lady!
What are you doing with the phone?

338
00:37:48,352 --> 00:37:50,270
You know how much those things cost?

339
00:37:50,729 --> 00:37:52,773
You got a lot of nerve!
- Shut up!

340
00:37:53,732 --> 00:37:55,526
This one doesn't work either.
- Huh?

341
00:37:56,109 --> 00:37:58,320
You women just don't know
how to use phones.

342
00:37:58,779 --> 00:38:00,823
You killed it!

343
00:38:02,658 --> 00:38:05,244
This is comin' out of your deposit!

344
00:38:07,621 --> 00:38:09,790
He's got her in sight.

345
00:38:10,707 --> 00:38:13,710
GR-13 has a lock on the girl.
What do you want me to do?

346
00:38:14,795 --> 00:38:19,091
Tell him to wait till they're
together. - GR-13, hold fire.

347
00:38:35,816 --> 00:38:39,570
And now, back to
"Nixon and the War Years, Part 7."

348
00:38:40,028 --> 00:38:44,283
We will keep America the strongest
nation in the world. And we will

349
00:38:44,741 --> 00:38:49,454
couple that strength
with firm diplomacy. No apologies.

350
00:38:51,206 --> 00:38:55,335
There was no question about that,
because when I resigned,

351
00:38:55,794 --> 00:38:58,672
later President Ford issued a pardon.

352
00:38:59,131 --> 00:39:03,552
When I accepted the pardon,
in that I made it very clear...

353
00:39:09,766 --> 00:39:14,229
I want that place surrounded.
- GR-86 and 61, take positions

354
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:16,523
at the rear of the motel.

355
00:39:20,486 --> 00:39:22,529
How are you feeling?

356
00:39:23,238 --> 00:39:24,573
The war is over.

357
00:39:26,116 --> 00:39:27,284
Maybe not.

358
00:39:28,619 --> 00:39:31,705
All focus to visual.
Powering alternate scanning devices.

359
00:39:32,164 --> 00:39:34,041
Motion detectors locked in.

360
00:39:35,584 --> 00:39:37,753
Something weird is going on here.

361
00:39:38,212 --> 00:39:41,507
None of the phones here work.
I mean, there hasn't been a storm.

362
00:40:05,864 --> 00:40:07,616
They're in the 2nd room now.

363
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:13,080
You better duck and cover!

364
00:40:18,168 --> 00:40:19,419
Follow me.

365
00:40:26,802 --> 00:40:28,470
He's in the 3rd room now.

366
00:40:44,778 --> 00:40:47,948
The last wall is solid concrete.
He's not going anywhere.

367
00:40:51,243 --> 00:40:52,619
I think we got him trapped.

368
00:40:55,664 --> 00:40:57,791
Go on, knock it down!

369
00:40:58,709 --> 00:40:59,668
What?

370
00:41:01,378 --> 00:41:02,212
Get down!

371
00:41:08,677 --> 00:41:09,970
Soldiers, move in.

372
00:41:28,489 --> 00:41:29,990
Where is he?

373
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:34,703
I think we lost him.
- That's impossible.

374
00:41:35,162 --> 00:41:39,082
Garth, get back to your station
and get me some tracking, dammit!

375
00:41:42,085 --> 00:41:43,962
You have a car?
- Yeah.

376
00:41:44,421 --> 00:41:48,133
Give me the keys.
- Hurry up. Don't worry. - Hurry.

377
00:41:48,592 --> 00:41:50,511
Got' em?
- Thank you.

378
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:55,891
I'm sorry.

379
00:41:56,350 --> 00:42:00,896
I'm so sorry. Really,
I had nothing to do with this.

380
00:42:04,233 --> 00:42:06,777
They're leaving the motel.
- Damn it!

381
00:42:34,638 --> 00:42:38,267
Come on, Woodward,
I need you out here.

382
00:42:39,268 --> 00:42:42,312
Way to go, Garth.

383
00:42:45,774 --> 00:42:48,360
20 dollar security deposit, huh?

384
00:42:56,451 --> 00:42:57,494
Woodward.

385
00:43:10,132 --> 00:43:12,259
He's trying to cool himself.

386
00:43:17,848 --> 00:43:20,392
Are you sure
they're not following us? - No.

387
00:43:21,935 --> 00:43:24,813
You're such a comfort.
- Buckle up.

388
00:43:25,814 --> 00:43:28,442
I'm fine.
- It's for your safety.

389
00:43:29,234 --> 00:43:33,864
How can you be so damn calm? Your
buddies just shot enough ammo at us

390
00:43:34,615 --> 00:43:38,160
to destroy Europe,
and you're worried about my seat belt?

391
00:43:39,369 --> 00:43:41,497
Alright, alright...

392
00:43:42,915 --> 00:43:44,291
All buckled up.

393
00:43:45,792 --> 00:43:47,544
Alright, Mr. Top Secret,

394
00:43:48,712 --> 00:43:50,631
I want some answers, okay?

395
00:43:51,089 --> 00:43:55,928
First, you push a car
faster than my mother drives,

396
00:43:56,386 --> 00:43:59,223
then you use ice
like other people use Band-Aids,

397
00:43:59,681 --> 00:44:02,226
and then you just run through walls.

398
00:44:02,684 --> 00:44:05,312
I'm sorry,
but this is not normal behavior.

399
00:44:05,771 --> 00:44:08,607
Now, just who the hell are you?

400
00:44:09,066 --> 00:44:12,277
Where are you from anyway?
Are you from France or Canada or...?

401
00:44:12,736 --> 00:44:16,281
I figure you must be French
because of your accent.

402
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:18,617
What accent?

403
00:44:19,993 --> 00:44:23,080
Look, you got a family?
You got friends?

404
00:44:23,539 --> 00:44:26,708
Is there a Mrs. 44
waiting for you someplace?

405
00:44:27,167 --> 00:44:30,212
Are you avoiding my questions
or don't you know?

406
00:44:49,648 --> 00:44:51,441
What the hell did they do to you?

407
00:44:52,734 --> 00:44:54,278
I don't know.

408
00:45:01,243 --> 00:45:04,288
But I'm going to find out.

409
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:34,568
Hey, no smoking around the pumps!
- I'm sorry. - Come on.

410
00:45:35,027 --> 00:45:36,945
Would you quit pulling on my arm?

411
00:45:37,988 --> 00:45:39,448
Park the car.

412
00:45:40,199 --> 00:45:41,450
Let's go.

413
00:45:42,075 --> 00:45:43,285
Park the car?

414
00:45:43,744 --> 00:45:49,500
I need some help. - Need some help?
I can't help you with this thing!

415
00:45:49,958 --> 00:45:51,502
What are you doing?

416
00:45:55,339 --> 00:45:57,549
Not this again, huh?

417
00:45:58,008 --> 00:46:01,929
Could you at least
leave your pants on this time?

418
00:46:02,971 --> 00:46:04,932
Great. Just great.

419
00:46:05,682 --> 00:46:09,311
There must be a tracking device on me.
- Yeah, and?

420
00:46:09,770 --> 00:46:12,064
Look for something unusual.

421
00:46:13,315 --> 00:46:15,067
Something hard.

422
00:46:18,821 --> 00:46:19,696
Okay. Alright.

423
00:46:25,494 --> 00:46:26,870
You stay in shape.

424
00:46:27,913 --> 00:46:30,582
What are you doing?
- Nothing!

425
00:46:31,416 --> 00:46:35,337
What do you mean, "park your car?"
- You never heard of valet parking?

426
00:46:35,796 --> 00:46:37,923
Do I look like a valet?

427
00:46:38,382 --> 00:46:40,342
Does this look like Beverly Hills?

428
00:46:40,801 --> 00:46:42,761
Is that supposed to be there?

429
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:46,890
Yes, yes, it is. It's very normal.

430
00:46:47,975 --> 00:46:49,476
Keep going.

431
00:46:51,019 --> 00:46:52,104
Right.

432
00:46:56,525 --> 00:46:58,819
Update informational
computer scanning system.

433
00:46:59,278 --> 00:47:02,030
They've stopped
in front of a single story structure.

434
00:47:02,739 --> 00:47:05,450
I think I found something.
On the back of your leg.

435
00:47:13,876 --> 00:47:16,545
Cut it out.
- Cut it out?

436
00:47:17,004 --> 00:47:20,424
Hey, I can't cut it out.
I'm not gonna cut you.

437
00:47:30,517 --> 00:47:32,269
Oh, shit!

438
00:47:33,270 --> 00:47:37,483
You best hurry up and get outta there,
I got a business to run here.

439
00:47:40,611 --> 00:47:42,988
Take it.
- What?

440
00:47:43,405 --> 00:47:47,409
Take it!
- Take it? - We don't have much time.

441
00:47:48,452 --> 00:47:52,414
Oh God, this is so gross.

442
00:47:56,251 --> 00:47:58,337
Oh God, this is so gross.

443
00:47:59,296 --> 00:48:02,007
Are you okay?
- Yeah.

444
00:48:03,717 --> 00:48:07,221
Good. I gotta lie down.

445
00:48:28,867 --> 00:48:31,703
I want a complete scan
of the entire area.

446
00:48:34,790 --> 00:48:36,500
Enabling infrared.

447
00:48:37,584 --> 00:48:40,003
That's his car.
- Scanning for body heat.

448
00:48:40,462 --> 00:48:42,631
Got it.
- Arms?

449
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:46,301
Pistol, fully loaded.
Desert Eagle. That's him.

450
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:50,764
Motions and heat scan. Follow
tracking. Flanking advance pattern.

451
00:48:51,265 --> 00:48:54,810
Three teams. North, East, South,

452
00:48:55,269 --> 00:48:56,812
converge on my command.

453
00:48:57,271 --> 00:49:00,357
Teams, advance. Surround target.

454
00:49:00,816 --> 00:49:04,319
Teams East and South
prepare for break and ram.

455
00:49:13,912 --> 00:49:16,748
Prepare and ram. Full charge.

456
00:49:17,207 --> 00:49:20,085
Okay, guys, move in.
- Full charge!

457
00:49:25,924 --> 00:49:28,093
No, no. He tricked us. Hold on!

458
00:49:30,971 --> 00:49:33,974
Pull out!
All UniSols retreat immediately!

459
00:49:34,433 --> 00:49:38,228
Evacuate! Let's go!
Get out of there!

460
00:49:39,146 --> 00:49:40,230
Take cover!

461
00:49:46,069 --> 00:49:48,322
Take cover!
- What the hell was that?

462
00:49:57,372 --> 00:49:58,957
Oh, my God.

463
00:50:00,125 --> 00:50:01,418
They're on fire!

464
00:50:01,877 --> 00:50:05,130
Portable coolants.
Portable coolants, quick!

465
00:50:16,558 --> 00:50:20,062
Put that out! Get him out!
Extinguishers! Woodward, Garth!

466
00:50:20,521 --> 00:50:23,106
Garth, get over here!
Get this guy, come on!

467
00:50:27,486 --> 00:50:29,863
Over here, Woodward! Get him!

468
00:50:33,784 --> 00:50:37,162
Get those coolants ready!
Get that truck operating!

469
00:50:39,206 --> 00:50:42,960
Woodward, get him over here!
Get more of that coolant!

470
00:51:02,521 --> 00:51:07,276
Over here, over here! Get GR-74!
Put that coolant on him!

471
00:51:10,821 --> 00:51:12,990
Got it, got it. Go.

472
00:51:14,116 --> 00:51:15,450
Alright, hurry!

473
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:20,205
Oh, here I go again. I'm out of here!

474
00:51:28,213 --> 00:51:32,384
We're gonna lose these two!
- At 250 million dollars a piece?

475
00:51:32,843 --> 00:51:35,888
Buckle up.
- Right, seat belt. Okay, go.

476
00:52:10,923 --> 00:52:11,840
Oh Jesus.

477
00:52:12,591 --> 00:52:14,760
He should have buckled up.

478
00:52:15,219 --> 00:52:17,262
He's getting up. Go. Go.

479
00:52:32,528 --> 00:52:33,570
Shit!

480
00:52:34,404 --> 00:52:37,115
They're pulling the plug.
We're heading home.

481
