1
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:53,679
Evenin' fell just like a star

2
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:57,182
Left a trail behind

3
00:00:58,851 --> 00:01:01,395
You spitted
You slammed out the door

4
00:01:03,856 --> 00:01:06,108
If this is love, we're crazy

5
00:01:06,984 --> 00:01:09,486
'Cause we fight like cats and dogs

6
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:13,156
I just know
there's got to be more

7
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:21,415
Please call me, baby

8
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:25,169
Wherever you are

9
00:01:26,128 --> 00:01:29,173
It's too cold to be out
walkin' in the streets

10
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:34,428
We do crazy things
when we're wounded

11
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:37,097
Everyone's pretty insane

12
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:43,228
I don't want you
catchin' your death of cold

13
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:46,648
Out walkin' in the rain

14
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,793
I admit that I ain't no angel

15
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:09,963
I admit that I ain't no saint

16
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:14,218
I'm selfish and I'm cruel
but you're blind

17
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:19,014
If I exorcise my devils

18
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:22,601
Well, my angels may leave too

19
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:26,522
When they leave
they're so hard to find

20
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:34,530
Please call me, baby

21
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,242
Wherever you are

22
00:02:39,368 --> 00:02:42,412
It's too cold to be out
walkin' in the streets

23
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,543
We do crazy things
when we're wounded

24
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,087
Everyone's pretty insane

25
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:56,343
I don't want you catchin'
your death of cold

26
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:59,680
Out walkin' in the rain

27
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:12,067
Answer me honestly.

28
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:15,445
If I was to tell you
that I love you...

29
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:19,700
and that I'd throw it all away
to be with you...

30
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,952
w-what would you say to me?

31
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,538
Good night, Paulie.

32
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:30,919
Yep. Yep, that's about par
for the evening.

33
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:34,173
But what I want to see

34
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,302
Is the way things used to be

35
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:42,931
Between you and me

36
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,352
The way things used to be

37
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,734
Let me guess.

38
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:58,947
Your old lady got fed up because
you're out here chasing the skirt...

39
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:01,909
so she took these little ones
and left you.

40
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:05,996
It's a little more com-- It's
a little more complicated than that.

41
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:09,541
Oh, yes, it always is. Everybody thinks
their story is the one with the twist.

42
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:12,544
But let me tell you,
in my experience it's--

43
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:15,172
- Holy shit.
- Exactly.

44
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:19,051
- This I've got to hear.
- No, look, uh, it's a long story.

45
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:21,303
And I know you're ver--
I know you're very busy...

46
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:24,264
and I don't really feel
like swapping stories...

47
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:28,310
- Wait, wait, wait. No, no, no, wait.
- if you want to know the truth.

48
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,773
Hmm?

49
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:38,779
Okay, now tell me, Father, how long
has it been since your last drink?

50
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:44,993
Um, it's been about a minute and a half
since my last drink.

51
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:47,746
Of course.
Now, what about these kids?

52
00:04:50,249 --> 00:04:51,792
Okay, um--

53
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:56,338
- Well, you see the one on the right?
- Mmm.

54
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:58,882
- The cu-- The cute one?
- Mm-hmm.

55
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:00,425
That's me.

56
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:04,137
- That's very cute.
- Brian Finn.

57
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,848
Paulie Chopra.

58
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:09,059
Okay, well-- Now, you see
this kid on the left?

59
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:11,228
- Mmm.
- That was my best friend Jake.

60
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:13,480
- He's a priest too?
-Jake?

61
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,608
No, um, as it--
as it turns out, Jake's a rabbi.

62
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,821
Come on. A priest and a rabbi?
I think I've heard this one.

63
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:25,117
No, look, I've heard all those, and,
trust me, you have not heard this one.

64
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:30,163
Okay? So there's this priest and
this rabbi, and they're best friends.

65
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:34,418
- Mmm.
- But before they were
a priest and a rabbi...

66
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:37,880
they both knew this girl.

67
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,007
- Ah, the girl.
- Yeah.

68
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:44,178
- Who's the girl?
- That's Anna Reilly.

69
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:46,972
Reilly? Let me guess.
She became a nun?

70
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,642
Not quite. Not quite.

71
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:56,190
See, we all met in the sixth grade
at P.S. 84 right here in Manhattan.

72
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:03,071
I think I already knew Jake,
and then we both met Anna.

73
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,742
No, wait, you know what? Actually,
I remember exactly how we met...

74
00:06:06,742 --> 00:06:10,370
'cause, well, it was sort of
one of those defining moments.

75
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:16,502
Well, after that we were
pretty much inseparable.

76
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,679
Now, Jake and I were definitely
what you'd call "late bloomers."

77
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:30,849
And your average seventh-grade girl's
attentions can be pretty fickle.

78
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:33,894
But not Anna.
Her loyalty to us was constant.

79
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:37,689
Anna was the friend
that every 13-year-old boy dreams of.

80
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:41,985
You know, that magical cross between
Jonny Quest and Tatum O'Neal in Foxes.

81
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:47,115
Yes! Yes!

82
00:06:57,876 --> 00:07:01,839
Yeah, we were some trio. Anna used
to call us "two Micks and a Yid."

83
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:04,132
She was gonna make T-shirts.

84
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:07,219
You know, there's eight million
people in New York...

85
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:12,266
but when the three of us were together
it felt like we were living
on our own little island.

86
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:15,352
But New York is an island.

87
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:18,522
I'm trying to sprinkle
a little fairy dust here.

88
00:07:18,522 --> 00:07:21,650
- I'm-- I'm trying to tell a story.
- I'm terribly sorry.

89
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:24,862
- Continue. Go on. Sprinkle away.
- Mm-hmm. Okay.

90
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:28,156
Well, then disaster struck.

91
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,244
The summer after eighth grade,
Anna's father got a job in California...

92
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:34,788
and just like that,
she was gone.

93
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:47,092
Well, as for me and Jake, our friendship
just got stronger and stronger.

94
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:49,887
In most ways, we were like
any other two kids in New York...

95
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:53,140
but our relationship did have
this one unusual component--

96
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,767
we were fascinated
with each other's religions.

97
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:58,770
He showed me
the secret rituals of Judaism...

98
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:01,899
and I let him in on
the Catholic mysteries.

99
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:05,235
Just remember:
spectacles, testicles, watch, wallet.

100
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:20,751
I bet you're wondering what makes two
kids wanna become a priest and a rabbi
in this day and age.

101
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:23,837
Well, you know, people don't talk
that much about a calling any more...

102
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:26,048
but I just knew it was something
I was supposed to do.

103
00:08:26,048 --> 00:08:30,928
And even way back then,
everybody just seemed to feel good
bringing their problems to me.

104
00:08:30,928 --> 00:08:34,014
My parents had basically given up
on children when I came along...

105
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:36,642
so my mother always called me
her gift from God.

106
00:08:36,642 --> 00:08:41,563
That really stuck with me, and when
I was eight I told her I had a feeling
I was supposed to return the favour.

107
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:43,607
She was so happy, she cried.

108
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:47,361
My dad just wanted to know
if working for God came with dental.

109
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:53,325
Now, Jake's sense of a calling
might not have gelled as early as mine.

110
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:56,453
Religion was really more
of a hobby for him at first.

111
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:58,997
Got it. Got it.
Need it. Need it.

112
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:03,168
Got it. Got it.
Need it. Got it.

113
00:09:07,923 --> 00:09:10,259
Jake was just one of those
special kids, you know.

114
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:15,222
He was smart, popular.
Everything came easy to him.
He just had that kind of aura about him.

115
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:20,477
You took one look at this kid
and you knew he could do anything
he wanted with his life.

116
00:09:20,644 --> 00:09:24,565
Jake's family had been in the investment
banking business for three generations.

117
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:29,194
His father and his brother Ethan
both tried to convince him
to join them at the family firm.

118
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:35,117
I think he gave it some serious thought,
but in the end he decided he wanted
to do something different with his life.

119
00:09:35,117 --> 00:09:39,246
When he made his decision
to become a rabbi, he did it
with great confidence and resolve.

120
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:41,415
I don't want to listen to any of you!

121
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:45,377
Jake and I went off to seminary
the way other guys go off to the army
or the Peace Corps.

122
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:47,337
It was an adventure.

123
00:09:48,881 --> 00:09:53,594
Newly ordained as masters of theology,
we were both assigned
back to New York City...

124
00:09:53,886 --> 00:09:57,556
where we quickly confronted
the practical aspects of our jobs.

125
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:24,750
Oh! Jesus!

126
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:38,555
And despite these early setbacks,
we eventually found our groove.

127
00:10:38,931 --> 00:10:42,601
- Take it nice and easy.
Win 'em over slowly. Okay?
- Okay.

128
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,395
Shabbat shalom, everyone.

129
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:47,606
Before we get started,
I want you all to do me a favour.

130
00:10:47,606 --> 00:10:51,652
I want everybody in the back there
to come on forward and fiIl up
these first three rows here.

131
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:55,280
Oh, guys, come on.
Let's try one more time. Shabbat shalom!

132
00:10:56,365 --> 00:10:58,951
- Shabbat shalom!
- Thank you, Mom.

133
00:10:59,368 --> 00:11:01,870
Ma'am, you in the back.
Yes, you. Come on.

134
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,206
God hates a solo artist,
I promise you.

135
00:11:04,206 --> 00:11:06,834
We're gonna be the Fugees here
this morning. No Lauryn Hills.

136
00:11:06,834 --> 00:11:09,419
Okay, my mom is the only person
in the room...

137
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:13,799
approximating the level
of "Shabbat shalom"-iness
that I think we can hit.

138
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:20,222
Sir, you're leaving. Why-- I--
It's customary to sneak out
after the Communion.

139
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:23,392
Now, give me something I can work with,
folks. Shabbat shalom!

140
00:11:23,392 --> 00:11:26,895
- Shabbat shalom!
- All right! Now we're ready to daven!

141
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:31,817
I don't want to brag, but the word got
out that there was a new act in town...

142
00:11:31,817 --> 00:11:36,488
and soon we were playing to
the packed houses I always knew
we'd been destined for.

143
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:40,242
I know. I know!

144
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:49,418
I-- I-- I know.
But seriously, what is the story
of Sodom and Gomorrah really about?

145
00:11:49,418 --> 00:11:52,462
- Anybody. Steve Posner.
- Sexual perversion.

146
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:57,467
Sexual perversion.
Steve Posner's watching
a little too much Spice Channel, okay.

147
00:11:57,509 --> 00:12:01,096
The Seven Deadly Sins.
Who can name the Seven Deadly Sins?

148
00:12:04,183 --> 00:12:08,937
People, it was a very popular film
with Brad Pitt.
You have the ultimate Cliff note.

149
00:12:09,897 --> 00:12:12,858
And Lot takes them in
and he protects them.

150
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:16,361
What happens next? Anybody.
Ah.

151
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:19,615
Greta Nussbaum,
before she pulls her rotator cuff.

152
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:22,034
God spares Lot and his family.

153
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:26,413
Bingo! Two-week cruise for Greta!
You're goin' to the Bahamas!

154
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:30,042
You know,
when you think about it...

155
00:12:30,042 --> 00:12:32,252
God is a lot like
Blanche Du Bois.

156
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:35,380
He's always relied on
the kindness of strangers.

157
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:38,926
And that's really what the story
is about-- it's about us
taking care of each other.

158
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:41,887
God relies on us
to take care of each other.

159
00:12:42,054 --> 00:12:46,683
The truth is, I don't really
learn that much about your faith
by asking questions like that...

160
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:50,854
because those aren't really
questions about faith,
those are questions about religion.

161
00:12:50,854 --> 00:12:54,691
And it's very important
to understand the difference
between religion and faith.

162
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:58,028
Because faith is not about
having the right answers.

163
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:01,323
Faith is a feeling.
Faith is a hunch, really.

164
00:13:02,157 --> 00:13:05,994
It's a hunch that there is something
bigger connecting it all...

165
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:09,122
connecting us all together.

166
00:13:10,082 --> 00:13:12,751
And that feeling, that hunch, is God.

167
00:13:15,379 --> 00:13:18,632
And coming here tonight,
on your Sunday evening...

168
00:13:19,174 --> 00:13:22,553
to connect with that feeling,
that is an act of faith.

169
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,891
And so all I have to do is look around
the room at this packed church...

170
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,937
to know that we're doing pretty well
as a community.

171
00:13:34,773 --> 00:13:37,860
Even if all of you
failed my pop quiz miserably.

172
00:13:38,986 --> 00:13:40,612
Let us pray.

173
00:13:43,407 --> 00:13:48,745
Jake and I used to talk about how we
needed to kick the dust off our faiths,
bring 'em up to speed with the times.

174
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:50,831
No more of the old routines.

175
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:55,043
Jake said, "We're gonna give 'em
an old-world God with a new-age spin."

176
00:13:58,046 --> 00:13:59,298
Feel the prana.

177
00:13:59,298 --> 00:14:01,550
Our first big idea was to turn
this abandoned gay disco...

178
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:05,387
into a joint Catholic-Jewish
senior centre-slash-karaoke lounge.

179
00:14:06,013 --> 00:14:09,308
You know, sort of a Fiddler on the Roof
meets Lord of the Dance...

180
00:14:09,308 --> 00:14:11,643
meets Buena Vista Social Club.

181
00:14:12,144 --> 00:14:14,563
Not an easy idea to sell
to some of the higher-ups...

182
00:14:14,563 --> 00:14:16,982
but that's what we lived for--
to push the envelope.

183
00:14:16,982 --> 00:14:20,694
You know, we were gonna bring our
religions into the 21 st century
any way we could.

184
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:23,780
We were gonna shove 'em a little,
if we had to.

185
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:28,410
Jake said we were gonna be like those
young cops who come on the force
and shake things up.

186
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:30,579
You know-- the God Squad.

187
00:14:39,254 --> 00:14:42,216
Well, it's just like the ocean
under the moon

188
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:46,720
Well, it's the same as the emotion
that I have for you

189
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:51,099
You got the kind of lovin'
that can be so true, yeah

190
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:54,353
So give me your heart
Make it real

191
00:14:54,603 --> 00:14:56,647
Or else forget about it

192
00:14:58,774 --> 00:15:00,817
Or else forget about it

193
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:04,905
Or else forget about it

194
00:15:04,947 --> 00:15:07,074
Come on, bring it. Nice.

195
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:13,455
Oh. So Ben Lewis comes into my office
this morning, tells me he's retiring.

196
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:15,833
- Rabbi Lewis?
- Yeah.

197
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,170
- Wow, that's the end of an era.
- I know.

198
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:23,215
But that's exciting. How long before
they give it over to you officially?

199
00:15:23,215 --> 00:15:27,427
Well, I'm telling you,
there are a few backwards thinkers
on that board who just--

200
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:29,638
They don't get what I do.
You know?

201
00:15:29,638 --> 00:15:32,975
Plus, there's the whole thing
about me being single.

202
00:15:34,393 --> 00:15:37,396
- Single?
- Don't think that's not an issue.

203
00:15:37,855 --> 00:15:42,025
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
are you seriously telling me that
if you don't find a nice Jewish girl...

204
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:45,028
and settle down in the next six months,
they're not gonna give you this job?

205
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:49,283
I'm seriously telling you
that-- that there's not been
a bachelor head rabbi of B'Nai Ezra...

206
00:15:49,283 --> 00:15:51,910
since the beginning of the synagogue.

207
00:15:52,494 --> 00:15:54,163
- Wow. I mean--
- I know. It's--

208
00:15:54,163 --> 00:15:57,082
You'd better start
getting out there more.

209
00:15:57,166 --> 00:16:02,462
- Tell me about it. It's embarrassing.
- Okay, okay, but forget about that.
You do want to meet somebody, right?

210
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:07,342
No, I'm just saying that I want
to meet somebody in a spontaneous
and casual manner, that's all.

211
00:16:07,342 --> 00:16:10,429
- And it's almost impossible with me.
- Why? I don't understand that.

212
00:16:10,429 --> 00:16:13,807
- Because I'm a rabbi.
- Yes. Yes. What's your point?

213
00:16:14,725 --> 00:16:17,436
The point is that every time
I go out with a woman I don't know
if she likes me just for me...

214
00:16:17,436 --> 00:16:19,646
or because I'm Rabbi Jake.

215
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,649
You know?
There's a certain expectation.

216
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:25,485
It's like, I can't go with my impulses.
I have to-- I don't know.

217
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:28,906
Jews want their rabbis
to be the kind of Jews that
they don't have the time to be.

218
00:16:28,906 --> 00:16:32,618
Yeah, and Catholics want their priests
to be the kind of people
they don't have the discipline to be.

219
00:16:32,618 --> 00:16:35,621
- So, we knew this getting into it.
- Right.

220
00:16:35,787 --> 00:16:38,081
Oh, no, man. Check this out.

221
00:16:38,123 --> 00:16:40,834
- God Squad in the house.
- What's up, Shabazz?

222
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:43,670
Okay, so, you gonna give it up, Rabbi,
or are we gonna have to
go through the motions?

223
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:47,132
Get ready to say your prayers, my
friends, 'cause I am in no mood today.

224
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:49,801
- Watch your ass, Shabazz!
- Come on

225
00:16:51,595 --> 00:16:53,263
Turn me loose

226
00:16:55,766 --> 00:16:57,518
Just turn it up

227
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:00,187
Power to the people, y'all

228
00:17:00,312 --> 00:17:02,564
- Turn it loose, hey
- Oh!

229
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:05,067
Shake hands with the 8-0-8

230
00:17:05,067 --> 00:17:07,361
Like I said before
PE got a brand new funk

231
00:17:07,361 --> 00:17:09,321
- Turn it up
- Bye.

232
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:11,907
- Good game, Shabazz.
- Tell your mother I said "hi."

233
00:17:11,907 --> 00:17:13,450
All right.

234
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:17,246
Power to the people

235
00:17:20,582 --> 00:17:23,585
I gotta quit playing with those guys
from Jewish Theological Seminary.

236
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:25,754
It really lowers the bar.

237
00:17:26,797 --> 00:17:29,007
Oh, can I just say "oy"?

238
00:17:29,925 --> 00:17:31,885
Amen to your "oy."

239
00:17:32,761 --> 00:17:36,682
- What happened to our youth?
- I'm telling you, it ended at 30, pal.

240
00:17:36,682 --> 00:17:39,226
Oh, hey, speaking of our youth,
I forgot to tell you something.

241
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:41,562
- What?
- This is big. Guess who called me.

242
00:17:41,562 --> 00:17:43,146
- Who?
- Okay.

243
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:47,192
Think about who is the coolest woman
you and I have ever known, ever.

244
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:51,905
That's easy. Anna Reilly, eighth grade.
No question.

245
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:53,949
- You got it.
- What?

246
00:17:54,616 --> 00:17:55,993
- She called you?
- Yeah.

247
00:17:55,993 --> 00:17:58,370
- Anna Reilly called you?
- Yeah. Totally out of the blue.

248
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:01,165
- Why?
-'Cause she's coming to New York,
uh, for work...

249
00:18:01,165 --> 00:18:02,833
and she wanted to get together
with us.

250
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,501
- She just looked me up.
- Really?

251
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:06,712
- Yeah.
- Anna Reilly. What is she doing now?

252
00:18:06,712 --> 00:18:11,216
She-- She's, like, analyzing synergies,
or synergising analogies,
or, or some such thing.

253
00:18:11,216 --> 00:18:15,637
I couldn't follow it. She's, like, this
very high-powered business-- You know.

254
00:18:16,346 --> 00:18:18,390
- Woman?
- Woman, yes. Thank you.

255
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:21,560
- Wow. And you told her about us?
- Yeah. She flipped,
in a-- in a good way.

256
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,855
You know, I mean, she laughed for about
ten minutes, but she was excited.

257
00:18:24,855 --> 00:18:27,399
- Man, that is so cool.
- I know.

258
00:18:28,692 --> 00:18:30,986
I wonder why she called you.

259
00:18:31,695 --> 00:18:33,530
What do you mean?

260
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,033
No, I mean, she called you.

261
00:18:38,035 --> 00:18:41,079
- What, are you
in the eighth grade still?
- What? That's a legitimate question.

262
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:43,582
I just-- I mean, we're both listed.

263
00:18:43,582 --> 00:18:46,585
Finn before Schram, okay?
You're ridiculous.

264
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:50,380
That's a good point.
Alphabetical.

265
00:19:00,349 --> 00:19:02,309
I think we should toss this.
We look like idiots.

266
00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:04,645
- Shut up. We do not.
- You shut up.

267
00:19:04,645 --> 00:19:09,775
- You think she's changed?
- No, I bet she still weighs 88 pounds
and listens to Leif Garrett.

268
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,655
For the record, it's Leif. Long "A."
Didn't you see the Behind the Music?

269
00:19:14,655 --> 00:19:17,491
Hey, come on, admit it.
You're excited. This is gonna be great.

270
00:19:17,491 --> 00:19:21,119
The three of us hanging together again?
I can't believe it.

271
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:26,166
- Is that her?
- No. No.

272
00:19:29,795 --> 00:19:31,088
Wow.

273
00:19:31,922 --> 00:19:33,924
- Hail Mary.
- Mary.

274
00:19:34,967 --> 00:19:37,928
- Full of... something.
- Full of something'.

275
00:19:40,514 --> 00:19:42,140
Hello, boys.

276
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:49,147
- I don't understand.
- Well, basically, I'm like a plumber,
except I fix leaky corporations.

277
00:19:49,147 --> 00:19:51,108
- Oh.
-Jake Schram.

278
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:53,944
- Yes.
- How are you? Who are you?

279
00:19:53,944 --> 00:19:56,697
Tell me everything. Give me the 4-1 -1 .
I wanna know.

280
00:19:56,697 --> 00:19:58,323
- Well--
-Job, girls, news.

281
00:19:58,323 --> 00:20:01,285
Oh, now, hey, come on, come on.
I know him. I know him. Y-You start.
Catch us up right now.

282
00:20:01,285 --> 00:20:04,288
- All right. Job is good. Really good.
- Men.

283
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:07,082
News: My parents
are happy and retired.

284
00:20:07,082 --> 00:20:08,709
- And, uh--
- Men?
- I take yoga.

285
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:09,918
- Men.
- That's my life.

286
00:20:09,918 --> 00:20:11,670
- No.
- Men.
- Come on.

287
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:13,964
- Don't cheat us. G-Give it up.
- I don't-- Relationships? Yada-ya--

288
00:20:13,964 --> 00:20:17,259
I don't have time for relationships.
I work, like, 100 hours a week.

289
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:19,678
- You guys have no idea.
- Hey. Hey.

290
00:20:19,678 --> 00:20:24,391
- Excuse me. I think that we work
pretty hard for a tough...
- Yeah, working for the--

291
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:26,518
- That's a...
- boss.
- full-time thing.

292
00:20:26,518 --> 00:20:31,648
No, I work harder than God.
If He had, uh, hired me, He would have
made the world by Thursday.

293
00:20:31,732 --> 00:20:34,776
Great. That's great. So you're saying
that we're just never going to see you.

294
00:20:34,776 --> 00:20:37,696
- Is that-- This is the big kiss-off.
- No, for you guys I will make time.

295
00:20:37,696 --> 00:20:40,199
- Wow. I feel special.
- That's my bag.

296
00:20:40,199 --> 00:20:41,950
- I got it. I got it.
- I got it. I got it.

297
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:44,786
- I got it.
- I got it, man. I got-- No, I got it.
Let me-- Let me-- I-I can get it.

298
00:20:44,786 --> 00:20:46,455
Okay. Thanks.

299
00:20:47,539 --> 00:20:49,875
- You okay?
- Yep-- No-- Go.

300
00:20:50,042 --> 00:20:52,794
Remember the names of some of those kids
we went to school with?

301
00:20:52,794 --> 00:20:56,173
- Remember Aram Salaam?
- Mm-hmm. His father
was a diplomat, right?

302
00:20:56,173 --> 00:20:59,301
He was always saying
he couldn't get a parking ticket 
'cause he had diplomatic immunity.

303
00:20:59,301 --> 00:21:02,012
- Remember Elan Portnoy?
- Yeah, he was always complaining.

304
00:21:02,012 --> 00:21:04,223
He was always smoking pot.

305
00:21:16,693 --> 00:21:19,154
- Hey, remember our shoplifting club?
- Oh, yeah.

306
00:21:19,154 --> 00:21:23,492
- You had to steal something
to be a member.
- How about you with the basketball?

307
00:21:23,492 --> 00:21:26,411
Remember she stuck
that basketball under her shirt,
and you said you were pregnant?

308
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:29,164
- I pulled it off.
- Yeah, but you were twelve.

309
00:21:29,164 --> 00:21:33,252
Yeah, but it was New York, it was the 
'80s. You could get away with anything.

310
00:21:33,252 --> 00:21:35,212
- We should get home, right?
- Huh?
- Yeah, it's getting kinda late.

311
00:21:35,212 --> 00:21:38,590
- We should take you back.
- Well, I'm still on West Coast time.
It's only 8:00 my time.

312
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:40,634
Let's go do something.

313
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:48,016
So this is a rectory.
Sounds like a dirty word-- "rectory."

314
00:21:48,517 --> 00:21:50,727
- Great place to meet chicks.
- Totally.

315
00:21:50,727 --> 00:21:53,814
Oh, I'll bet.
So, what's your chick situation?

316
00:21:53,814 --> 00:21:57,192
Oh, uh, don't ask.
It's, it's, it's not a good story.

317
00:21:57,734 --> 00:22:00,696
- Why?
-'Cause his whole congregation's
trying to set him up...

318
00:22:00,696 --> 00:22:02,614
and it makes him very uncomfortable.

319
00:22:02,614 --> 00:22:06,743
- What's wrong with that?
- There's a reason that pandas
don't mate in captivity.

320
00:22:06,743 --> 00:22:11,248
- What does that mean?
- It means that all these mothers
keep making these dates for me

321
00:22:11,248 --> 00:22:14,126
They're very intimidating.
They're like the Kosher Nostra.

322
00:22:14,126 --> 00:22:18,046
- Oh.
- It's true. They're little women,
but they're very determined.

323
00:22:18,046 --> 00:22:20,215
You get a little melodramatic
about this, don't you think?

324
00:22:20,215 --> 00:22:22,384
Oh, yeah? Check this out.

325
00:22:22,593 --> 00:22:25,470
- I was faxed one of their daughter's
resumes this morning.
- Get out.

326
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:29,016
- Let me see that. "Ali Decker."
- Yeah. Look at the bottom.

327
00:22:29,016 --> 00:22:31,768
- Oh. She has a skills section.
- Yes?

328
00:22:31,977 --> 00:22:34,771
Oh. You win.
She put jogging as a skill.

329
00:22:34,813 --> 00:22:37,941
See, she doesn't even know the
difference between a hobby and a skill.

330
00:22:37,941 --> 00:22:41,069
- All right, well, maybe
she's a skilled jogger.
- I have to go on a date with this girl.

331
00:22:41,069 --> 00:22:43,906
- Why don't I just say no?
- I don't know. Why don't you?

332
00:22:43,906 --> 00:22:47,493
Because I can't alienate these women.
They-- I need body count at the temple.

333
00:22:47,493 --> 00:22:49,745
Just relax. It'll be fine.

334
00:22:51,205 --> 00:22:53,874
Oh, God, please let this be painless.

335
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:56,793
- Hi.
- Hi.

336
00:22:56,835 --> 00:22:59,588
Right on time.
I like that in a rabbi.

337
00:23:01,006 --> 00:23:04,176
Oh. Hey, this is a great place.
This is really--

338
00:23:05,052 --> 00:23:07,054
- My lair.
- really nice.

339
00:23:07,054 --> 00:23:09,681
- I'll be ready in a second.
- A lot of space.

340
00:23:09,681 --> 00:23:12,059
I know.
Thanks, Daddy. Right?

341
00:23:14,686 --> 00:23:16,313
You go, girl.

342
00:23:18,899 --> 00:23:20,651
No pain, no gain.

343
00:23:22,486 --> 00:23:25,447
Oh. Tuesdays with Morrie.
I love that book.

344
00:23:35,874 --> 00:23:37,417
I'm ready.

345
00:23:39,127 --> 00:23:42,172
- Oh, do you, uh, do these tapes?
- Are you kidding me?

346
00:23:42,172 --> 00:23:43,715
- No.
- Are you kidding me?

347
00:23:43,715 --> 00:23:46,176
- Hmm. No.
- These tapes are my life.

348
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:49,471
Exercise is like a religion to me.
No pun intended.

349
00:23:49,847 --> 00:23:52,599
- Feel my abs. Not bad, right?
- Ouch.

350
00:23:54,393 --> 00:23:56,478
- Punch me.
- Excuse me?

351
00:23:56,478 --> 00:23:59,648
- You heard me.
- Um, I-I'm not gonna punch you.

352
00:23:59,773 --> 00:24:03,569
I think you will find, Rabbi Schram,
that this princess is no pushover.

353
00:24:03,569 --> 00:24:06,989
I can tell. And, hey, come on.
Call me Jake. All right?

354
00:24:07,155 --> 00:24:10,325
Okay, let's get a few things
straight here, Jake.

355
00:24:10,492 --> 00:24:12,536
One: I like you a lot.

356
00:24:13,287 --> 00:24:16,874
And unless my radar is completely
on the blink, I think you like me.

357
00:24:16,874 --> 00:24:20,669
- Well, I mean, we-- we just met, but--
- Two: I am many things.

358
00:24:20,669 --> 00:24:24,131
No one thing defines me.
Are we clear about that, Jake?

359
00:24:24,965 --> 00:24:27,342
- Yes.
- Then let me have it.

360
00:24:27,926 --> 00:24:29,761
- I'm not gonna punch you.
- Punch me!

361
00:24:29,761 --> 00:24:32,514
-You're a girl. I'm not gonna punch you.
-Hit me. I can take it.

362
00:24:32,514 --> 00:24:34,391
- I'm not scared.
- I'm sure-- I know you're not.
I just-- You're a girl, and--

363
00:24:34,391 --> 00:24:36,560
- What, are you some kind of wuss?
- No, I'm not a wuss--

364
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:40,522
- But I'm not gonna punch a--
Oh. All right.
- Little wuss, little wuss,

365
00:24:40,522 --> 00:24:42,357
Oh. Are you okay?

366
00:24:43,108 --> 00:24:46,111
- I'm fine.
- You sure?
-J-Just get my bag.

367
00:24:46,111 --> 00:24:49,281
- Okay. Uh, you said you could take it--
- Fine!

368
00:24:50,741 --> 00:24:52,910
That's wonderful.
Th-That headband's so cool.

369
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:54,703
- Oh, I'm so glad you noticed.
- Yeah. What is that?

370
00:24:54,703 --> 00:24:57,581
- It was-- It was beaded
by the mentally retarded.
- Oh, really?

371
00:24:57,581 --> 00:24:59,333
- Yes.
- Really? 'Cause it looks
really good, though.

372
00:24:59,333 --> 00:25:01,335
- Oh, n--
Well, they're heavily supervised.
- Uh-huh.

373
00:25:01,335 --> 00:25:03,545
- Th-They--
- Yeah, but it really-- i-it seems to--

374
00:25:03,545 --> 00:25:05,797
- I mean--
- It goes together well, don't you feel?

375
00:25:05,797 --> 00:25:07,466
- Oh.
- My God. Get a--
- Oh, no, no. That's--

376
00:25:07,466 --> 00:25:08,926
- Get away from the table.
- Whoa, no, no, no.

377
00:25:08,926 --> 00:25:11,220
- Get out of here.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. That's okay. Hey.

378
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:13,472
Hey, here, here, here.
D-Don't-- Don't-- Here.

379
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:15,682
- Thank you. Thank you. Have a nice day.
- You're flushing it down the toilet.

380
00:25:15,682 --> 00:25:19,728
- Thank you. Don't-- You don't wanna--
- He's gonna spend it on booze.

381
00:25:25,526 --> 00:25:28,904
Well, I had a great time.
Thank you. It was wonderful.

382
00:25:32,616 --> 00:25:34,368
Uh, good night.

383
00:25:36,036 --> 00:25:39,665
- Don't you want to come up, tuck me in?
- I-I-I shouldn't.

384
00:25:40,958 --> 00:25:42,835
Believe me, you should.

385
00:25:42,835 --> 00:25:46,296
No, I can't. I-I--
You're a congregant, and-- You know?

386
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:50,926
I'm telling you, you can.
I want you to.

387
00:25:52,845 --> 00:25:54,972
I-- I-- I would love to.

388
00:25:55,305 --> 00:25:58,809
I just-- I-I have a-- I got a--
I have a friend at home.

389
00:25:58,851 --> 00:26:01,478
- A friend?
- A male friend. A guy.

390
00:26:03,063 --> 00:26:04,940
A dog. A male dog.

391
00:26:06,483 --> 00:26:09,444
- A beautiful puppy named Pinchas.
- Pooch can wait.

392
00:26:09,444 --> 00:26:12,656
- No, no, no, he's a Rottweiler.
-Just come up for a minute
or two or three.

393
00:26:12,656 --> 00:26:17,244
No, no, no, no! No! Don't! Don't.
No, listen to me. This dog
is a codependent little puppy.

394
00:26:17,244 --> 00:26:20,998
He needs my help,
or else he'll go to the bathroom
over everything. He does it.

395
00:26:20,998 --> 00:26:23,167
Well, send me the cleaning bill.
Get outta here.

396
00:26:23,167 --> 00:26:27,296
- No, no, no. Don't get out. No, stay.
I-- I would-- It's not gonna--
- You are making me crazy, Rabbi.

397
00:26:27,296 --> 00:26:29,965
- You're making me so-- No. No.
-Just come on. Just come up for me.

398
00:26:29,965 --> 00:26:32,467
- Come on! For a minute!
- I can't!

399
00:26:32,467 --> 00:26:35,345
-Just come on!
- Aah! Are you okay? Good!

400
00:26:36,388 --> 00:26:38,557
- Oh, wow.
- Go! Go! Go!

401
00:26:38,682 --> 00:26:42,477
- Hey! Hey!
- Thanks! I had a wonderful time!
See you in shul!

402
00:27:23,977 --> 00:27:27,564
You're not playing games with me,
are you, Phil? You sure?

403
00:27:27,773 --> 00:27:30,859
Okay, 'cause you know better
than that, right?

404
00:27:31,068 --> 00:27:35,239
Okay. Well, if those results are
correct, then I, uh, say we have a deal.

405
00:27:36,365 --> 00:27:39,910
Of course, I'll expect it in writing
by the end of the day.

406
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:43,789
Yes, by the end of the day, Phil.
What, did I stutter?

407
00:27:45,082 --> 00:27:48,377
All right, Phil, you know what?
I don't have time for this, okay?

408
00:27:48,377 --> 00:27:51,004
Gotta go, Phil.
Gotta go, gotta go.

409
00:27:52,714 --> 00:27:54,132
No way.

410
00:27:57,219 --> 00:27:58,971
Oh, yeah, baby.

411
00:28:17,364 --> 00:28:20,909
Okay, okay. It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay. Take a break. Take a break.

412
00:28:20,909 --> 00:28:23,495
I suck. They're gonna
take away my yarmulke.

413
00:28:23,495 --> 00:28:26,540
- No, no, no, you-- you don't suck.
- I suck.

414
00:28:27,583 --> 00:28:29,877
Okay. Yes, you do. You suck.

415
00:28:31,253 --> 00:28:36,508
But that's okay. You're supposed to
suck. This isn't a talent contest,
this is a rite of passage.

416
00:28:36,717 --> 00:28:40,470
I mean, this happens in all cultures.
It's about you being 13 years old.

417
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:42,681
God knew that your voice
was gonna change when you were 13.

418
00:28:42,681 --> 00:28:47,060
There's a reason why you gotta do your
haftorah at this age. It's a challenge.

419
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:50,981
God is challenging you. He's calling you
a chump. So you gotta come back at him.

420
00:28:50,981 --> 00:28:56,236
So you gotta say,
"Hey, hashem, you think You can scare me
with a little, uh, biblical Hebrew...

421
00:28:56,528 --> 00:28:58,405
just 'cause my balls
haven't dropped yet?''

422
00:28:58,405 --> 00:29:01,825
I'm serious. I'm serious. You gotta
show Him what Alan Klein's made of.

423
00:29:01,825 --> 00:29:04,286
- How?
- By sucking with style.

424
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:08,123
Embrace the suckiness.
Just say, "I love that I suck."

425
00:29:08,874 --> 00:29:11,835
- I love that I suck.
- Good, but own it. Say it.

426
00:29:11,835 --> 00:29:14,796
- I love that I suck.
- I love that I suck!

427
00:29:14,838 --> 00:29:17,090
- I love that I suck.
- I love that I suck. Good. Good.

428
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:19,426
- You play. I love that I suck.
- I love that I suck.

429
00:29:19,426 --> 00:29:21,762
- Keep going with that.
- I love that I suck.

430
00:29:21,762 --> 00:29:24,306
-Okay, good. I'll see you
next week. Hello?
-I love that I suck. I love that I suck.

431
00:29:24,306 --> 00:29:26,683
-Hello?
-I love that I suck. I love that I suck.
-You suck. You can do it.

432
00:29:26,683 --> 00:29:30,312
- Hey, Anna?
- I thought I got the Tony Robbins
hot line there by mistake.

433
00:29:30,312 --> 00:29:32,564
Sorry. I just was, uh, finishing up.
How you doin'?

434
00:29:32,564 --> 00:29:35,108
- I called to see how the big date went.
- That's so funny.

435
00:29:35,108 --> 00:29:38,987
I had an impulse to call you
last night, and then I didn't 
'cause I thought it'd be too late.

436
00:29:38,987 --> 00:29:41,740
You should have. I was stuck here
barking at Los Angeles.

437
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:44,034
- Really.
- So, how'd it go?

438
00:29:45,953 --> 00:29:49,873
Um, mostly horrible, with a few
brief moments of excruciating agony.

439
00:29:50,499 --> 00:29:54,044
- But at least it was long.
- lam so sorry. What a waste.

440
00:29:54,127 --> 00:29:58,674
People should have to qualify
to go out with you. You're too
precious to be on the open market.

441
00:29:58,674 --> 00:30:01,677
- That's what I try to tell them.
- See? They should listen to you.

442
00:30:01,677 --> 00:30:04,638
You're the best. You know that?
If only you were Jewish.

443
00:30:04,638 --> 00:30:06,932
Yeah, well, nobody's perfect.

444
00:30:08,392 --> 00:30:10,352
So, what'd you wear?

445
00:30:10,644 --> 00:30:11,979
What?

446
00:30:12,855 --> 00:30:15,607
I'm not gonna tell you what I wore
on my date. Why should I do that?

447
00:30:15,607 --> 00:30:19,820
I wanna get an image of a young rabbi
on the prowl. What's your game, man?

448
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:22,865
All right.
Navy blue button-down shirt.

449
00:30:23,532 --> 00:30:25,576
Mmm.
It's a good colour for your eyes.

450
00:30:25,576 --> 00:30:28,162
- Navy blue pinstripe suit.
- I can picture that.

451
00:30:28,162 --> 00:30:30,664
Tasteful,
yet with a quiet power.

452
00:30:31,456 --> 00:30:33,750
That's me.
Chic but with a quiet power.

453
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:35,127
Shoes?

454
00:30:35,961 --> 00:30:38,297
Black, Kenneth Cole, leather.

455
00:30:39,381 --> 00:30:40,716
Size?

456
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,468
- Big.
- Ow!

457
00:30:44,553 --> 00:30:46,722
Wanna hear about the special knot
in my tie?

458
00:30:46,722 --> 00:30:49,766
Oh, baby, no.
We gotta save room for dessert.

459
00:30:51,768 --> 00:30:54,605
- Don't give up hope. Okay?
- I'll keep it alive.

460
00:30:54,605 --> 00:30:57,274
That's right.
Goodbye, Mr Sharp-Dressed Man.

461
00:30:57,274 --> 00:30:58,734
Bye-bye.

462
00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:13,540
Ah, nice.

463
00:31:25,844 --> 00:31:29,223
I have a friend here
I thought you might want to see.

464
00:31:31,391 --> 00:31:35,020
Will you now please turn
to page 508 for "Ein Keloheinu"?

465
00:31:36,647 --> 00:31:39,316
I'm sorry, Raphae.
Just hang on one second here.

466
00:31:39,316 --> 00:31:42,194
Guys, I gotta just say this
before we do this again...

467
00:31:42,194 --> 00:31:44,780
because it's really
been bothering me.

468
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:47,574
"Ein Keloheinu. "
It's a joyous song.

469
00:31:48,659 --> 00:31:51,495
It's a prayer
about praising the Lord...

470
00:31:51,829 --> 00:31:54,915
telling the Lord how much
we love Him, or Her.

471
00:31:55,666 --> 00:31:59,837
But no matter what I do, I can't
seem to be able to get you folks
to sing it with any feeling.

472
00:31:59,837 --> 00:32:03,006
I mean, I brought in the band.
That didn't work.

473
00:32:04,633 --> 00:32:06,927
I brought in my bongos last week.

474
00:32:06,927 --> 00:32:10,222
I think we can all agree
that was a backwards step.

475
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:15,686
So this morning I've decided to bring in
a little outside help.

476
00:32:16,353 --> 00:32:18,272
Maury, if you would.

477
00:32:30,242 --> 00:32:33,912
You can even sing along!
Come on! Have a little fun with it!

478
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:43,630
That's right! Get up! Get those butts
out of those chairs! Come on!

479
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:48,635
Up in the cheap seats!

480
00:32:49,386 --> 00:32:52,514
I can't hear you up there!
Sing it out! Come on!

481
00:32:54,391 --> 00:32:55,851
Over 70!

482
00:32:57,311 --> 00:32:59,563
Come on! All the young Jews!

483
00:33:08,989 --> 00:33:11,867
Hey! Congratulations!
You were wonderful!

484
00:33:12,034 --> 00:33:14,119
- Great job!
- Rabbi! Rabbi!

485
00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:16,872
This is my daughter.
Isn't she lovely?

486
00:33:28,175 --> 00:33:30,219
This is astonishing.
This is a shul.

487
00:33:30,219 --> 00:33:33,931
This is a house of worship.
Do you know what my grandfather
would do if he saw this?

488
00:33:33,931 --> 00:33:37,601
This is my daughter Ruthie.
She's in college.
She's going to be a physiotherapist.

489
00:33:37,601 --> 00:33:39,728
What a shaineh maidel you are.
Look at this.

490
00:33:39,728 --> 00:33:42,314
Oh, Rabbi, you're so wonderful.
You know my daughter Hillary.

491
00:33:42,314 --> 00:33:44,608
Mom, don't embarrass me. Hi.

492
00:33:52,991 --> 00:33:56,787
Jake, Bonnie Rose. I don't think
you've met my daughter Rachel.

493
00:33:56,954 --> 00:33:58,956
- Hi, Jake.
- Oh! Hi.

494
00:33:59,581 --> 00:34:01,750
This is exciting. We don't get
a lot of celebrities in here.

495
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:06,755
One time, once, when I was really young,
we had, uh-- Bella Abzug showed up
for a bris, but that was--

496
00:34:06,755 --> 00:34:10,008
Well, I've heard so much about you,
I had to come and see for myself.

497
00:34:10,008 --> 00:34:12,177
- The service was wonderful.
- Oh--

498
00:34:12,177 --> 00:34:14,721
You were really, really wonderful.

499
00:34:15,013 --> 00:34:16,807
Well, we're all certainly aware
of your successes.

500
00:34:16,807 --> 00:34:19,226
You know, she just moved
to network prime time.

501
00:34:19,226 --> 00:34:21,353
Ooh, look at that.
We got in a live feed.

502
00:34:21,353 --> 00:34:24,565
- Well, my mom does all my PR.
- I know what you mean. Mine too.

503
00:34:24,565 --> 00:34:26,817
No, I mean really.
My mother's firm does all my PR.

504
00:34:26,817 --> 00:34:28,986
-Jake, I'm at PMK.
- Oh.

505
00:34:29,027 --> 00:34:31,822
- We got her special correspondent.
- Great.

506
00:34:31,822 --> 00:34:34,408
You know, she just got back
from interviewing Arafat.

507
00:34:34,408 --> 00:34:36,493
- Yassir?
- In Arabic.

508
00:34:36,493 --> 00:34:39,663
- That's great. I didn't know that.
-Jake, what you don't know is a lot.

509
00:34:39,663 --> 00:34:41,957
You two should get together.

510
00:34:42,416 --> 00:34:44,877
- Sure.
- I'm free on Thursday.

511
00:34:45,169 --> 00:34:47,838
Thursday. That's--
That's fine-- That's great.

512
00:34:47,838 --> 00:34:50,924
- Okay.
- Okay, great. Well,
nice to see you, Bonnie.

513
00:34:50,924 --> 00:34:52,759
Rabbi. Wonderful.

514
00:34:54,845 --> 00:34:58,849
- This is Hillary--
- Oh! This is-- This is the man
you were telling-- Right. Yes, sir.

515
00:34:58,849 --> 00:35:02,644
Well, I appreciate what you did
for us in the war, I really do.

516
00:35:04,396 --> 00:35:08,317
- How upset are they?
- Let's just say
they're less than thrilled.

517
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,571
-To be honest, we're less than thrilled.
-Okay, with what, specifically?

518
00:35:12,613 --> 00:35:14,740
With what, specifically?

519
00:35:14,823 --> 00:35:17,242
Well, with guided meditation,
specifically.

520
00:35:17,242 --> 00:35:19,912
With stand-up comedy sermons,
specifically.

521
00:35:19,912 --> 00:35:23,290
With your loose, improvisational style,
specifically.

522
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:27,961
Okay, with people
actually enjoying services?
People-- People showing up at all?

523
00:35:27,961 --> 00:35:30,797
To be serenaded by
the Harlem-freaking-Gospel Choir?

524
00:35:30,797 --> 00:35:34,384
- At least they were praying.
- It was a hell of
an "Ein Keloheinu, " Lar.

525
00:35:34,384 --> 00:35:36,970
- It's not kosher, Rabbi Lewis!
- Larry, what does that mean?

526
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:39,765
I have to tell you what kosher means?
Study your gemara!

527
00:35:39,765 --> 00:35:42,518
I mean, is this you too?
Do you feel the same way?

528
00:35:42,518 --> 00:35:45,604
It's not your ideas.
Your ideas are very good.

529
00:35:46,438 --> 00:35:49,107
But sometimes you're a little aggressive
in the execution.

530
00:35:49,107 --> 00:35:52,277
Yeah, but, Ben, come on!
I mean, I mean, it was working!

531
00:35:52,277 --> 00:35:54,363
I know, I know, I know, I know.

532
00:35:54,363 --> 00:35:58,033
- You like to shake things up,
and that's good.
- When it works, yeah.

533
00:35:58,033 --> 00:36:03,080
But you have to appreciate the fact
that a lot of people come here
for a sense of continuity.

534
00:36:03,831 --> 00:36:07,251
It's not just the board.
I-It's your congregation, Jake.

535
00:36:08,168 --> 00:36:12,339
Mrs-- Mrs Katz likes to sing the
"Ein Keloheinu" the way she knows it.

536
00:36:12,673 --> 00:36:15,259
- Tradition is not old habit.
- All right, I'm-- I'm--

537
00:36:15,259 --> 00:36:19,680
- No. It's comforting to people.
- Okay, but I'm not interested
i-in baby-sitting Mrs Katz.

538
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,432
I-I wanna-- I wanna push people
to grow and expand.

539
00:36:22,432 --> 00:36:25,435
- Otherwise, what are we doing?
- I know, I know, I know.

540
00:36:25,435 --> 00:36:27,729
But you have to be patient
with them.

541
00:36:27,729 --> 00:36:30,566
I think you'll get a-- you'll find
that people will go a lot farther...

542
00:36:30,566 --> 00:36:33,944
if you-- if they feel
they're being led and not pushed.

543
00:36:37,322 --> 00:36:40,242
Good for you, Anna.
Oh, I'm so proud of you.

544
00:36:40,409 --> 00:36:42,870
No more of this
"woman behind the man" shit.

545
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:46,456
Half the men I know
are completely unworthy
of the opportunities they've had.

546
00:36:46,456 --> 00:36:49,251
You know, as a woman on your own,
trying to make your mark...

547
00:36:49,251 --> 00:36:52,796
what do you do with that victory energy
at the end of the day, you know?

548
00:36:52,796 --> 00:36:56,967
- I mean, don't you want
someone to share it with?
- Well, do what they do. Take lovers.

549
00:36:56,967 --> 00:36:59,636
- I've had more dates than Jake.
- Mom.

550
00:36:59,636 --> 00:37:01,138
It's true.

551
00:37:01,138 --> 00:37:05,017
And when lovers bore, which they
will, sublimate. I take classes.

552
00:37:06,435 --> 00:37:09,479
Me too. I'm addicted to it.
What's your favourite?

553
00:37:09,479 --> 00:37:11,398
- Kabbalah. You?
- Kickboxing.

554
00:37:11,398 --> 00:37:15,444
Oh, I used to take kickboxing, but I
don't know, I found it too high-impact.

555
00:37:15,444 --> 00:37:18,822
So I take Tae-Bo now. It's doubled my
energy. You really ought to try it.

556
00:37:18,822 --> 00:37:21,533
- Yeah. I need that high impact though.
- Yeah, I know what you mean.

557
00:37:21,533 --> 00:37:24,912
- I take Native American drumming.
- You take Tae-Bo?

558
00:37:26,413 --> 00:37:29,041
Oh, look at those pomegranates, huh?

559
00:37:29,249 --> 00:37:30,501
Oh.

560
00:37:33,253 --> 00:37:36,340
Oh, Our Lady's Bedstraw.
The most poetic herb.

561
00:37:38,383 --> 00:37:41,803
All right, now over to you. Anybody
new in your life I should know about?

562
00:37:41,803 --> 00:37:44,681
Wow, 20 minutes.
I can't believe we made it this far.

563
00:37:44,681 --> 00:37:48,227
It's my God-given right to check.
Now, what about that Shapiro girl?

564
00:37:48,227 --> 00:37:51,396
- Oh, no, not the Shapiro girl
again, please.
- Why? She was a looker.

565
00:37:51,396 --> 00:37:54,566
- That wasn't the problem.
The problem was here.
- What, bad skin?

566
00:37:54,566 --> 00:37:56,693
- No, not bad skin.
- What?

567
00:37:56,693 --> 00:38:01,281
Okay, all right, you want an example?
I take her out to dinner, I order
dessert, she says she doesn't want any.

568
00:38:01,281 --> 00:38:03,700
So I get pecan pie.
She asks me for a bite.

569
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:06,119
I give her a bite.
Her face swells up like a chipmunk.

570
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:09,498
She looks at me and she goes,
"Oh, my God, are there nuts in this?"

571
00:38:09,498 --> 00:38:12,125
- So what?
- Mom, it was pecan pie.

572
00:38:12,334 --> 00:38:15,254
- Oh, there must be somebody
for you. Come on.
- Oh, no, I don't even want

573
00:38:15,254 --> 00:38:17,464
- Oh, come on. Tell her.
- I don't want to talk about it.

574
00:38:17,464 --> 00:38:20,592
- He's got a very hot prospect.
- Oh? Who? Who?

575
00:38:20,759 --> 00:38:24,513
Rachel Rose! Okay? Rachel Rose.
That's who I'm going out with.

576
00:38:24,721 --> 00:38:27,641
- ABC Rachel Rose?
- Yes, ABC Rachel Rose.

577
00:38:28,433 --> 00:38:33,730
Well, I think I could be in-laws
with ABC Rachel Rose. Hmm?
Peter Jennings would be at the wedding!

578
00:38:34,314 --> 00:38:39,403
Hey, hey, speaking of in-laws,
Ethan and Jackie took me to see her
mom's new play, and it was hilarious.

579
00:38:39,403 --> 00:38:41,572
- How is Ethan?
- He's great. He just got a promotion.

580
00:38:41,572 --> 00:38:43,782
He's a vice president now.

581
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:47,786
- They gave him Dad's old office.
- Oh.

582
00:38:48,203 --> 00:38:50,914
How nice.
I gotta hear this from you.

583
00:38:51,123 --> 00:38:55,127
- Hey, maybe if you called
and congratulated him--
- I don't want to talk about it.

584
00:38:55,127 --> 00:38:59,006
- Mom, he would be so happy
to hear from you. Just--
- Please, Jake, please.

585
00:38:59,006 --> 00:39:02,259
Don't spoil this, huh?
I got you. I'm proud of you.

586
00:39:02,509 --> 00:39:06,722
I got this beautiful garden. I've
reconnected with this great old friend.

587
00:39:06,847 --> 00:39:10,017
Let's just hold hands and breathe, hmm?
Together.

588
00:39:14,188 --> 00:39:16,356
- You're not breathing, Jake.
- I'm breathing.

589
00:39:16,356 --> 00:39:20,360
-I don't hear you breathing.
-I don't breathe audibly, but I breathe.

590
00:39:27,951 --> 00:39:29,828
- Mm-hmm?
- Whoo.

591
00:39:56,688 --> 00:39:59,191
All right, you know what?
I gotta go. I gotta go. I gotta go.

592
00:39:59,191 --> 00:40:02,194
- I've gotta go. Yes, I've gotta go.
- I gotta go. Really gotta go.
- All right, all right. Hi.

593
00:40:02,194 --> 00:40:07,157
- Why don't you just have that thing
implanted in your ear?
- Oh, I'll be top on the list.

594
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:10,702
- Beep-beep!
- Oh-- Oh.
- Hello, young sir!

595
00:40:10,702 --> 00:40:14,331
- Hello, Radioman.
- I feel like I'm in The Godfather.
Look at you.

596
00:40:14,331 --> 00:40:19,044
Yeah, well, you know, I'm God's
consigliere. You gotta go through me
to get to Him, so I'm very popular.

597
00:40:19,044 --> 00:40:21,171
Oh, whoa. Children. Hey.

598
00:40:40,065 --> 00:40:42,943
I totally forget
how amazing New York is.

599
00:40:44,027 --> 00:40:47,781
I know. You know, I think
whoever said it, it was really true.

600
00:40:48,073 --> 00:40:53,328
The true New Yorkers understand that
people living anywhere else must be,
in some sense, kidding.

601
00:41:01,587 --> 00:41:05,048
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah, obviously. Anything.

602
00:41:05,632 --> 00:41:07,551
It's personal, so--

603
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:11,930
- Okay, wait a second.
Are we gonna have the sex talk here?
Is that what this is gonna be?

604
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:14,766
You're my friend,
and I wanna know how this works for you.

605
00:41:14,766 --> 00:41:16,894
- It's fine. Fire away.
- Really?
- "Really?"

606
00:41:16,894 --> 00:41:19,104
- No-- Okay. Okay.
- Yeah, no, come on. Come on.
I know you got a list.

607
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:20,898
- Okay.
- Okay.

608
00:41:21,607 --> 00:41:24,359
- Well, you don't, right?
- No. Right.

609
00:41:25,277 --> 00:41:27,237
- At all.
- At all.

610
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:30,157
So, have you ever?

611
00:41:31,825 --> 00:41:34,203
- Yes!
- Had sex?
- Yes.

612
00:41:34,203 --> 00:41:37,122
- With women.
- Yes.
- So you're not gay?

613
00:41:37,122 --> 00:41:39,458
- Oh, no. No.
- Are you sure?

614
00:41:39,458 --> 00:41:42,377
Yes, but even if I was,
the rules are the same.

615
00:41:42,377 --> 00:41:44,213
- Okay.
- Right.

616
00:41:44,755 --> 00:41:48,050
- Do you miss it?
- No.
- Are you tempted?

617
00:41:48,383 --> 00:41:51,637
- Oh, admit it. If they changed
the rules, you'd be psyched.
- I don't even think about it.

618
00:41:51,637 --> 00:41:54,348
- Do you fantasize?
- I have dreams sometimes,
but not really.

619
00:41:54,348 --> 00:41:57,809
- How is that possible?
- What, specifically?
- I've seen the way women look at you.

620
00:41:57,809 --> 00:42:01,480
- Even though they know you're a priest.
Especially when they know, actually.
- I'm not blind, okay?

621
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:05,359
- Okay, so how do you deal with that?
- It's not an issue for me.

622
00:42:07,069 --> 00:42:10,864
- It's really not. It's not--
- Really?
- Yeah, I'm past that point. It's--

623
00:42:10,864 --> 00:42:14,117
I'm completely committed to what I do.
I really am.

624
00:42:14,117 --> 00:42:18,121
To my work, to ministering to people.
It defines me completely as a person.

625
00:42:18,121 --> 00:42:21,667
- A-And it fulfills me. You know?
I'm very happy.
- Hmm.

626
00:42:21,834 --> 00:42:26,505
And, and that, that particular
sacrifice is-- It's a gesture.
It's a symbol of my commitment.

627
00:42:26,505 --> 00:42:29,508
- That's quite a gesture.
- Yeah, I know it seems that way.

628
00:42:29,508 --> 00:42:33,512
But, you know, I-- It's like
when people quit smoking, and,
and the first year is really tough...

629
00:42:33,512 --> 00:42:36,640
and then people
can light up right in front of you
and it doesn't even bother you.

630
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,601
I quit smoking two years ago.
When people smoke in front of me,
I want to French-kiss them...

631
00:42:39,601 --> 00:42:42,312
just to suck the smoke
out of their lungs, okay?

632
00:42:42,312 --> 00:42:45,023
- Well, don't be a priest.
- I-- God!

633
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,901
I really admire your commitment.

634
00:42:48,443 --> 00:42:50,654
- Well--
- I don't think I could take it.

635
00:42:50,654 --> 00:42:52,948
You've given up all kinds of things
for what you do. You--

636
00:42:52,948 --> 00:42:56,493
Yeah, but there comes a point
where I just crave contact.

637
00:42:57,911 --> 00:43:01,373
You know? Like, I-I wanna
touch someone and be touched.

638
00:43:04,543 --> 00:43:06,461
Oh, you're amazing.

639
00:43:07,963 --> 00:43:10,257
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

640
00:43:13,343 --> 00:43:15,929
- Thus endeth the sex conversation?
- Thus endeth.

641
00:43:15,929 --> 00:43:17,264
Okay.

642
00:43:19,349 --> 00:43:22,769
I bet no one ever asks
the Dalai Lama these questions.

643
00:43:29,193 --> 00:43:32,029
You know what?
Len, don't argue with me.

644
00:43:32,404 --> 00:43:35,491
Look, I have it right here
in front of me, and it's not right.

645
00:43:35,491 --> 00:43:38,160
I'll be back in the office in an hour.
Run it again.

646
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,579
God, I hate these Harvard guys.

647
00:43:41,413 --> 00:43:43,248
Mmm! Rachel Rose.

648
00:43:44,249 --> 00:43:46,335
- Mmm.
- Yeah. When's that going down?

649
00:43:46,335 --> 00:43:48,921
- Thursday.
- Thursday night, 8:00 p.m., dinner.

650
00:43:48,921 --> 00:43:52,424
- Are you excited?
- Yeah. I have a pretty good feeling.

651
00:43:52,966 --> 00:43:56,929
- Where are you taking her?
- I don't know. I thought, uh, Ernie's.

652
00:43:57,137 --> 00:44:00,557
Ernie's? You can't take her to Ernie's.
Ernie's has been around
since we were kids.

653
00:44:00,557 --> 00:44:04,436
You might as well
take her to Houlihan's.
You cannot take Rachel Rose to Ernie's.

654
00:44:04,436 --> 00:44:08,816
- Definitely not Ernie's.
Definitely not. Mm-mmm. Uh-oh.
- No, you gotta take her

655
00:44:08,816 --> 00:44:11,985
- No, hot. Definitely hot.
- Well, what's--
Okay, what's new and hot?

656
00:44:11,985 --> 00:44:15,739
- What do we know about this girl?
- Rachel Rose, 29 years old,
Columbia School of Journalism.

657
00:44:15,739 --> 00:44:18,992
- Middle East affairs expert.
- Perfect. Middle Eastern.

658
00:44:18,992 --> 00:44:22,412
She can order in Arabic. Give her
a chance to shine. What's a good place?

659
00:44:22,412 --> 00:44:25,874
Delphini's. Definitely Delphini's.
Four stars, New York Times.
Definitely Delphini's.

660
00:44:25,874 --> 00:44:28,752
- Need a reservation. Delphini's.
- Now, are you gonna wear a suit,
or are you gonna go cas'?

661
00:44:28,752 --> 00:44:31,630
I don't know. I don't know.
I hadn't thought about it. I guess cas'.

662
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:33,549
-No, suit.
-No, suit. Definitely suit. Definitely--

663
00:44:33,549 --> 00:44:36,677
Hey, shut up, Rain Man.
Seriously. Enough, all right?

664
00:44:36,677 --> 00:44:39,763
- Now you're making me think about this.
- Oh, relax. You'll do great.

665
00:44:39,763 --> 00:44:42,307
Hey, what if you guys came with me?

666
00:44:42,349 --> 00:44:46,311
What, you wanna bring a priest
to your first good date in two years?
That-- What kind of a strategy is that?

667
00:44:46,311 --> 00:44:49,773
I don't want to bring a priest.
I wanna bring my friend Brian
and his girlfriend Anna.

668
00:44:49,773 --> 00:44:52,359
We could m-make it like a double date.
Come on.

669
00:44:52,359 --> 00:44:55,654
Pretend you're a couple. What's wrong
with that? What, are you busy? Huh?

670
00:44:55,654 --> 00:44:58,115
- You can bring your cell phone. You'll
be totally connected the whole time.
- I'm always busy.

671
00:44:58,115 --> 00:45:00,325
- That's not the point.
- What's the point, then?

672
00:45:00,325 --> 00:45:03,203
- The point is, you're old enough
to date without a chaperone.
- Amen.

673
00:45:03,203 --> 00:45:07,291
I don't need a chaperone, I just
need some help. Come on. Guys, please?

674
00:45:07,291 --> 00:45:09,084
I'm begging you.

675
00:45:12,379 --> 00:45:16,341
Yeah, that's the way the business
is going. People want their news
to have more of an edge.

676
00:45:16,341 --> 00:45:19,094
- That's why Brokaw stands now.
- What?

677
00:45:19,094 --> 00:45:22,014
Tom Brokaw. He stands up
when he reads the news.

678
00:45:22,014 --> 00:45:24,141
- The whole time?
- Yeah.

679
00:45:24,141 --> 00:45:27,519
- He does?
- Well, he's been doing it
for about a year now.

680
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:29,646
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
- I gotta watch the news more.

681
00:45:29,646 --> 00:45:33,066
You know, I saw your saringas report.
It was very powerful.

682
00:45:33,066 --> 00:45:35,486
Thanks. I really earned my stripes
with that piece.

683
00:45:35,486 --> 00:45:39,281
Mmm. I earned my stripes by getting
through a bris without fainting.

684
00:45:39,281 --> 00:45:42,826
- I talked Mc Donald's
out of the Mc Oyster.
- And a grateful nation thanks you.

685
00:45:42,826 --> 00:45:46,538
- Made me a star.
- So, how long have you two
been together?

686
00:45:48,332 --> 00:45:51,210
- Oh, right, uh--
- Oh, God, like-- Oh, we go way back.

687
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:54,213
We've all known each other since we were
kids, 'cause we grew up together.

688
00:45:54,213 --> 00:45:56,507
- I used to have a crush on Anna.
- Really?

689
00:45:56,507 --> 00:45:58,634
- I told you that.
- Did not!
- She knew that.

690
00:45:58,634 --> 00:46:00,594
- No, you didn't.
- Mm-hmm.
- No, you didn't.

691
00:46:00,594 --> 00:46:03,263
- I--
- Well, anyway, we reconnected.

692
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:07,976
A couple months ago, this was,
and, and we just clicked.
Uh, very unexpectedly, but--

693
00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:11,271
Oh, G-- I think it's so great
to be friends first. Don't you?

694
00:46:11,271 --> 00:46:13,357
Always. Friends first.

695
00:46:15,651 --> 00:46:18,695
So, do you write your own reports,
or how does that work?

696
00:46:18,695 --> 00:46:20,197
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, yeah.

697
00:46:20,197 --> 00:46:22,282
- Well, I wouldn't trust anybody else
to get 'em right, you know.
- Right, right.

698
00:46:22,282 --> 00:46:25,619
- I mean, you write
your own sermons, right?
- Mmm.

699
00:46:25,661 --> 00:46:28,455
Actually, I download them off the net.
There's this great service.

700
00:46:28,455 --> 00:46:31,250
- It's called www.hotgod.com.
- Really?

701
00:46:33,418 --> 00:46:35,045
Ow! Ooh. No.

702
00:46:36,213 --> 00:46:40,175
- No, I was kidding.
- Oh. So you-- you do
write your own sermons.

703
00:46:40,342 --> 00:46:42,427
- Yeah. Yeah.
- He writes beautiful sermons.

704
00:46:42,427 --> 00:46:47,975
Thanks. Actually, I like to improvise
a lot. You know, keeps everybody--
myself included-- on their toes.

705
00:46:47,975 --> 00:46:52,020
I-I-I guess you really can't do that
too much with your job, with the news.

706
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:53,814
- What?
- Riff.

707
00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:56,817
Oh, mmm, no, not really.

708
00:47:05,909 --> 00:47:09,163
You know, I'll bet the Middle East
is lovely this time of year, huh?

709
00:47:09,163 --> 00:47:11,415
Well, not if you're Kurdish.

710
00:47:11,874 --> 00:47:13,167
Mmm.

711
00:47:14,042 --> 00:47:15,586
Excuse me.

712
00:47:17,713 --> 00:47:21,466
Oh, my God. The Iraqi defence minister
just committed suicide.

713
00:47:22,384 --> 00:47:25,053
- Oh.
- Ooh.
- Is that bad or good?

714
00:47:25,095 --> 00:47:28,140
Well, i-- Brian,
would you explain it to him?

715
00:47:30,434 --> 00:47:31,852
I will.

716
00:47:33,979 --> 00:47:36,899
- How do you think it's going?
- She's really beautiful.

717
00:47:36,899 --> 00:47:39,943
- Sh-She's great too.
- Yeah.
- She's very adult.

718
00:47:39,943 --> 00:47:43,614
- Oh, y-you're doing great. We've
been-- We've been totally impressed.
- You look so hot in your suit.

719
00:47:43,614 --> 00:47:46,200
- Can I just tell you?
- Thank you.

720
00:47:46,783 --> 00:47:49,620
- You look beautiful.
- You do. You look amazing.

721
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:52,623
- Thanks, men.
- Yeah, there's something about you.
I don't know what it is.

722
00:47:52,623 --> 00:47:55,792
- Tonight there's some special--
- An absence of something.

723
00:47:55,792 --> 00:47:59,129
- Of the cell phone.
- Uh-uh-uh. It's set to vibrate.

724
00:47:59,588 --> 00:48:01,798
Oh, my-- Wow. That's sexy.

725
00:48:03,675 --> 00:48:07,346
- Did you ever just wanna
be free of that thing?
- No-- You don't understand.

726
00:48:07,346 --> 00:48:10,182
I-- I have a relationship
with my phone.

727
00:48:10,974 --> 00:48:13,727
We have a chemistry together.
I can't explain it.

728
00:48:13,727 --> 00:48:16,480
Yeah, well,
chemistry's a funny thing.

729
00:48:16,647 --> 00:48:20,150
Yes, it is. Are you speaking
abstractly or specifically?

730
00:48:23,028 --> 00:48:24,613
Abstractly.

731
00:48:28,867 --> 00:48:31,620
Well, looks like
I'm going to Baghdad.

732
00:48:32,663 --> 00:48:34,998
Two seconds. Two seconds.
So, it was a pleasure.

733
00:48:34,998 --> 00:48:37,042
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah. Take care.
- It was nice to meet you.

734
00:48:37,042 --> 00:48:39,294
- Yes. Good luck to both of you.
- Thank you.
- I'll talk to you soon.

735
00:48:39,294 --> 00:48:41,463
- Okay. All right. Okay.
- Okay.

736
00:48:41,463 --> 00:48:43,131
- I'll-- I'll talk to you.
- Okay. Okay, call me.

737
00:48:43,131 --> 00:48:45,384
- All right. Okay, thank you.
- Okay. Call me soon.

738
00:48:45,384 --> 00:48:48,053
- Thanks again.
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

739
00:48:58,063 --> 00:49:00,816
What are you thinking about
right now?

740
00:49:00,941 --> 00:49:03,610
Oh, it's funny.
I was at the Met yesterday.

741
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:06,947
- Again?
- I go every week now. And I
noticed this little painting.

742
00:49:06,947 --> 00:49:10,117
It was a watercolour
by Bonnard, and I've probably
passed it every single time...

743
00:49:10,117 --> 00:49:12,953
and I don't know why,
but this time I looked at it.

744
00:49:12,953 --> 00:49:16,248
And I was just-- I was riveted.
It was so beautiful.

745
00:49:18,834 --> 00:49:21,920
That's all. I was just wondering
why I never saw it before.

746
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:24,131
Well, I mean, sometimes...

747
00:49:24,506 --> 00:49:27,634
we don't see certain things
till we're ready to see'em...

748
00:49:27,634 --> 00:49:29,469
in a certain way.

749
00:49:30,012 --> 00:49:31,513
You know?

750
00:49:32,306 --> 00:49:33,849
Very true.

751
00:49:37,603 --> 00:49:38,937
Yeah.

752
00:49:41,148 --> 00:49:43,901
Hey, what's going on
with Ruth and Ethan?

753
00:49:43,901 --> 00:49:45,360
Oh, uh--

754
00:49:46,111 --> 00:49:49,823
Ethan married a Catholic girl,
and that did not go over well.

755
00:49:50,491 --> 00:49:54,578
- That's why they're fighting?
- No, no, they're not fighting.
They're not talking.

756
00:49:54,578 --> 00:49:56,914
Two years now, no comunicado.

757
00:49:57,623 --> 00:49:59,583
- Are you serious?
- Totally. It's--

758
00:49:59,583 --> 00:50:02,419
What? Weren't they
really close, though?

759
00:50:03,170 --> 00:50:05,964
- Oh, as close as Ruth and Jake.
- Wow.

760
00:50:08,634 --> 00:50:11,136
- Well, that explains a lot.
- Yeah. Yeah.

761
00:50:11,136 --> 00:50:14,223
I mean, you see why tonight
is not just a date.

762
00:50:21,688 --> 00:50:24,900
I feel really terrible about
having to cut the night short.

763
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:26,985
- You know, if they--
- That's fine. I totally understand.

764
00:50:26,985 --> 00:50:31,031
- I mean, when the beeper beeps--
- You know, I'm just gonna be packing.

765
00:50:31,031 --> 00:50:34,117
Would you, um, like to come up
for a nightcap?

766
00:50:34,952 --> 00:50:37,329
- Keep me company?
- Uh, um--

767
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:42,668
I would love to, but I think
I should let you do your thing.

768
00:50:42,668 --> 00:50:45,963
- I mean, you gotta
go to Baghdad. I mean--
- Yeah. Yeah.

769
00:50:45,963 --> 00:50:47,172
- So.
- Long flight. I know.

770
00:50:47,172 --> 00:50:48,549
- Yeah.
- It-- Well, okay.

771
00:50:48,549 --> 00:50:52,135
But when you get back,
we should definitely get together.

772
00:50:52,970 --> 00:50:54,513
- I would love to.
- Okay.

773
00:50:54,513 --> 00:50:57,057
- It's a date.
- Okay. All right.

774
00:50:58,308 --> 00:51:00,018
- Bye.
- Bye.

775
00:51:00,727 --> 00:51:02,020
Bye.

776
00:51:14,366 --> 00:51:15,701
Taxi!

777
00:51:21,290 --> 00:51:23,584
- Well, this is me.
- Okay.

778
00:51:23,584 --> 00:51:26,336
- You wanna come up for a while?
- Oh.

779
00:51:26,461 --> 00:51:30,841
I would love to, but I really
should get home, because I have
a very early conference call.

780
00:51:30,841 --> 00:51:33,844
Me too. I mean,
I gotta talk to the Big Guy.

781
00:51:35,637 --> 00:51:37,890
- Right.
- He calls early.

782
00:51:38,724 --> 00:51:41,643
- Rain check, though.
- Yeah. Definitely.

783
00:51:41,768 --> 00:51:42,936
- Definitely.
- Okay.
- Okay.

784
00:51:42,936 --> 00:51:44,521
Good night.

785
00:51:46,523 --> 00:51:48,817
- Good night.
- Good night.

786
00:52:16,595 --> 00:52:18,222
- Hi.
- Hi.

787
00:52:20,516 --> 00:52:22,643
What are you doing here?

788
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:25,687
I don't know.
What am I doing here?

789
00:52:43,831 --> 00:52:48,085
I haven't screamed that hard since
the U.S. hockey team beat the Russians.

790
00:52:48,085 --> 00:52:49,795
You're incredible.

791
00:52:49,795 --> 00:52:52,881
I've been wanting to do that since the
second you walked off that aeroplane.

792
00:52:52,881 --> 00:52:54,675
- Really?
- Yeah.

793
00:52:54,675 --> 00:52:57,219
Right away?
You hadn't seen me in 16 years.

794
00:52:57,219 --> 00:53:01,306
I know, and you were this, like, tough,
sexy, straight-ahead businesswoman.

795
00:53:01,306 --> 00:53:05,519
I just wanted to pull you off into
Security and give you a cavity search.

796
00:53:07,104 --> 00:53:09,523
Now that would have been impulsive.

797
00:53:09,523 --> 00:53:12,526
Yeah, well,
this is pretty impulsive for me.

798
00:53:15,404 --> 00:53:18,240
- Believe me.
- But good, though, right?

799
00:53:18,448 --> 00:53:22,411
Yeah, good, just, I mean, could get
a little complicated. You know?

800
00:53:25,372 --> 00:53:29,626
Well, what would people at work think
if they knew you were sleeping
with a rabbi?

801
00:53:29,626 --> 00:53:31,545
Could be a scandal.

802
00:53:34,381 --> 00:53:35,632
Oh.

803
00:53:37,759 --> 00:53:39,344
- Listen.
- Yeah.

804
00:53:39,344 --> 00:53:41,722
You know what my life is like.

805
00:53:42,389 --> 00:53:45,309
- I'm only here for a little while.
- Yes.

806
00:53:46,435 --> 00:53:50,063
And I'm fine just hanging out
having a great time with you.

807
00:53:50,230 --> 00:53:51,648
Mm-hmm.

808
00:53:52,941 --> 00:53:56,236
But sometimes I wanna jump you too.
What can I say?

809
00:53:58,822 --> 00:54:00,491
Is that okay?

810
00:54:00,991 --> 00:54:03,702
Yeah, it's okay.
It's more than okay.

811
00:54:07,039 --> 00:54:09,791
Think we should say anything
to Brian?

812
00:54:10,918 --> 00:54:13,962
I-I think it might be
a little weird for him.

813
00:54:16,048 --> 00:54:18,509
You don't think he'd understand?

814
00:54:18,675 --> 00:54:20,928
No, I just--
I don't know.

815
00:54:21,386 --> 00:54:24,139
I think we should
just keep it simple.

816
00:54:25,891 --> 00:54:27,643
I'm for simple.

817
00:54:29,061 --> 00:54:32,648
I have something simple
that I'd like to discuss with you.

818
00:54:36,151 --> 00:54:37,945
Do you wanna know

819
00:54:38,487 --> 00:54:40,614
If everythin' glitterin'

820
00:54:42,407 --> 00:54:44,451
Will turn into the gold

821
00:54:45,953 --> 00:54:47,704
I see in your hair

822
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:50,791
Feel it could be there

823
00:54:51,291 --> 00:54:52,709
Somehow

824
00:54:54,419 --> 00:54:55,838
Tonight

825
00:54:58,590 --> 00:55:00,551
And do you wanna fight

826
00:55:01,301 --> 00:55:03,428
Somethin' worth savin'

827
00:55:04,137 --> 00:55:06,390
The change would do me right

828
00:55:07,641 --> 00:55:09,977
'Cause I've been just waitin'

829
00:55:11,478 --> 00:55:13,856
And hesitatin' with this heart

830
00:55:17,317 --> 00:55:18,527
Of

831
00:55:20,654 --> 00:55:21,947
Mine

832
00:55:27,077 --> 00:55:29,079
You're still a mystery

833
00:55:30,038 --> 00:55:32,374
But there's somethin' so easy

834
00:55:33,208 --> 00:55:35,335
In how you're sweet to me

835
00:55:37,296 --> 00:55:39,006
I feel completed

836
00:55:39,464 --> 00:55:42,342
Like it's somethin' I needed
for this heart

837
00:55:46,513 --> 00:55:47,723
Of

838
00:55:49,766 --> 00:55:51,059
Mine

839
00:55:56,940 --> 00:55:59,568
There's always somethin'
so tragic

840
00:56:03,155 --> 00:56:05,324
About a hopeless romantic

841
00:56:24,092 --> 00:56:27,012
We have a Jake Schram here
for Anna Reilly.

842
00:56:27,471 --> 00:56:29,014
Yes? Okay.

843
00:56:31,350 --> 00:56:34,978
Hey, you know, I'm gonna be coming here
a lot, so maybe in the future we don't
have to do this whole name thing...

844
00:56:34,978 --> 00:56:39,107
and you could just say, "Hey, Jake,"
and I could say, "Hey, T-Bone."

845
00:56:40,734 --> 00:56:44,029
- That pass is good for one hour.
- Okay. Thank you.

846
00:56:45,239 --> 00:56:47,616
Wednesday night, you have
a due diligence call at 7:00...

847
00:56:47,616 --> 00:56:49,618
and a dinner at 8:00.

848
00:56:50,118 --> 00:56:54,122
All right. I'm make the call,
but cancel the dinner. I have a class.

849
00:56:54,373 --> 00:56:56,083
Oh, he's late.

850
00:56:58,377 --> 00:57:01,255
Oh, my God.
Are you guys getting serious?
