1
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:29,654
That's my train.

2
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:51,310
Wait! Wait!

3
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:39,451
Shit.

4
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:41,144
Ow.

5
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:56,868
Wake up, Jack.

6
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:16,922
Have you seen Francis?

7
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:23,057
Hello, Peter.

8
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:39,002
Good afternoon. Whitman?

9
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,545
Yes. -Yeah.
-Yeah.

10
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:42,638
May I see your tickets, please?

11
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:49,955
Thanks.

12
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:57,787
There's no smoking, please.

13
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:08,707
Welcome aboard.

14
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:13,911
Sweet lime?

15
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:15,503
Yes, please. -Sure, I'll
have one. -Sounds good.

16
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,758
Let's go get a drink
and smoke a cigarette.

17
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:40,172
I want to start by thanking you both
for being here. Thank you.

18
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:41,467
You're welcome.
-Thank you.

19
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:43,872
You're the two most important
people in the world to me.

20
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:47,468
I've never said that before, but it's true,
and I want you both to know it.

21
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:50,848
I love you, Peter.

22
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,144
Thank you.

23
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:53,445
I love you, Jack.

24
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:56,215
I love you, too.

25
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:57,789
How did it get to this?

26
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,915
Why haven't we spoken in a year?

27
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,288
Let's make an agreement.

28
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:02,418
To do what?
-Okay.

29
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,189
a.) I want us
to become brothers again

30
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:06,595
like we used to be,
and for us to find ourselves

31
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:07,688
and bond with each other.

32
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,858
Can we agree to that?

33
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:10,299
Okay. -Yeah.
-b.) I want us

34
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:11,836
to make this trip
a spiritual journey,

35
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:14,429
where each of us seek the
unknown, and we learn about it.

36
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,598
Can we agree to that?

37
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,266
Sure.
-I guess so.

38
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,470
c.) I want us
to be completely open

39
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:21,240
and say yes to everything,

40
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:22,871
even if it's shocking and painful.

41
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:24,279
Can we agree to that?

42
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,783
Now, I had

43
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:28,911
Brendan make us an itinerary.

44
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:30,079
Who's Brendan?

45
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:31,417
My new assistant.

46
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:33,822
He's gonna place an updated
schedule under our doors

47
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:35,723
every morning of all
the spiritual places

48
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:37,557
and temples
that we need to see

49
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:38,857
and expedite hotels

50
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:40,023
and transportation and everything.

51
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:41,361
How's he gonna do that?

52
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:43,958
I had him bring a printer
and a laminating machine.

53
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,162
Where is he?

54
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:47,034
In a way, it actually
doesn't matter.

55
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,904
He's in a different compartment
on another part of the train,

56
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:51,806
but we never see him-ever.

57
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,139
That's more or less it.

58
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,372
Three, please.

59
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,947
Does that sound okay to you?

60
00:06:56,048 --> 00:06:57,276
It sounds good, sure.

61
00:06:57,383 --> 00:06:58,611
Yeah, it sounds good.

62
00:06:58,718 --> 00:06:59,946
Do you have any questions?

63
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:02,282
I do.
-Okay, go ahead.

64
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:04,481
What happened to your face?

65
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:06,488
I only remember
certain details,

66
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,958
but from what I've been able
to reconstruct,

67
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:11,859
it was raining, I was going
about 50 miles an hour

68
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:14,455
as I went into a corner,
did some wrong steering,

69
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:17,434
wheels went out from me,
and I suddenly, whoo,

70
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:19,528
skidded off the road,
slammed into a ditch

71
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,834
and got catapulted
50 feet through the air.

72
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,932
Little particles
of glass and debris

73
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:25,977
were stinging my face as I flew.

74
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:28,342
And for a second,
there was just total silence.

75
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,506
Just...

76
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,209
Then bam! The bike crashed
to the ground,

77
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:34,980
exploded and caught on fire,

78
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:37,954
and I smashed into the side
of a hill with my face.

79
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:39,456
I was driving home.

80
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:41,493
I live alone right now.

81
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:44,791
Anyway, two joggers ran up
and started digging out

82
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:46,660
all the dirt that was
jammed inside my mouth

83
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:49,929
and my nose and my ears.

84
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:52,061
My brain had stopped,
my heart had stopped,

85
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:54,366
so technically I was dead
at this point.

86
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,567
They did all the procedures
exactly right,

87
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:59,577
as a result of which
I'm still alive.

88
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:01,169
Boy.
-Wow.

89
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,878
The first thing I thought
of when I woke up was,

90
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,578
I wish Peter and Jack were here.

91
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,440
Have you heard anything from Mom?

92
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,600
No.

93
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,109
Have you?

94
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:33,200
No.

95
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:35,940
Me neither.

96
00:08:36,048 --> 00:08:38,516
Fuck.

97
00:08:41,387 --> 00:08:42,718
What's that?

98
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:44,346
Some kind of Indian muscle relaxer.

99
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:46,721
I got it at the pharmacy
next to the train station.

100
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:48,521
What's that?

101
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:50,186
You don't need a prescription here.

102
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:51,422
A type of Indian flu medicine.

103
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:52,793
It's got a tranquilizer in it.

104
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:54,059
What's that?

105
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,191
Strongest Indian
painkiller you can get.

106
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:57,269
It's for my face.

107
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,598
Be careful with that.

108
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,865
You only want to take one drop.

109
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:07,437
Shh.

110
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,414
I also lost a tooth.

111
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:14,778
You want to read a short
story I wrote in France?

112
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,354
How long is it?

113
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:17,387
What?

114
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,515
How long is it?
-How long is it?

115
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:20,956
Never mind. Forget it.

116
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,688
You can save it till after dinner.

117
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,697
You know,
maybe right before

118
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:31,269
whenever you're about
to take out your tooth,

119
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:32,894
you should say something
like, "Please forgive this. "

120
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:34,438
Because it's, actually,
it's kind of...

121
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,837
Can... you... back away a little?

122
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:37,273
You just spit in my eye.

123
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:44,641
When was the last time you
were in America, by the way?

124
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,513
I don't know.

125
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:47,608
The funeral.

126
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,278
In other words, a year?

127
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:52,151
I have to tell you,

128
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,692
I support this relationship
not working out.

129
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:58,357
May I take your order, please?

130
00:09:58,464 --> 00:09:59,362
Let's see.

131
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:00,659
Do we want meat or fish?

132
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:01,994
I'm gonna have the chicken.

133
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,262
Jack, you want to try the fish?
I bet that's delicious.

134
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:05,302
And, Peter, the lamb?

135
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:06,735
A chicken, a fish and a lamb?

136
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:07,806
How does that sound?

137
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,804
Who wants a soup?
Raise your hand.

138
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:13,543
Are those Dad's glasses?

139
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:14,977
Yeah.

140
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:20,248
You still have
his prescription in here.

141
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:22,287
How can you see in these?

142
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:23,355
Three soups.

143
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,481
Soup.

144
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:28,989
Could you not order for me, please?

145
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:30,119
What?

146
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:31,958
Order for yourself.

147
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:42,807
What part are you on?

148
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:44,068
Nothing.

149
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:46,508
It reminded me of something
not related to it.

150
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:48,170
How's Alice?

151
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,976
She's fine.

152
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,812
She actually started
this company

153
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:54,886
where she makes these
little clay pots.

154
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,215
They're quite popular.

155
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,516
We sent you one.

156
00:10:57,623 --> 00:11:00,421
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

157
00:11:00,526 --> 00:11:01,925
Oh, thank you.

158
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,825
I want that stewardess.

159
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:15,399
These Germans are bothering me.

160
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:21,743
Ladies! Please keep it down.
Lower your voices. Thank you.

161
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:29,045
Did I... raise us?

162
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:31,123
Kind of?

163
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:35,157
Hang on-I'm gonna ask this guy

164
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:36,819
if he can get me a power adapter.

165
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,101
She's pregnant.

166
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,103
Alice.

167
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,433
Really?

168
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,405
You're kidding.
-No.

169
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:51,408
Uh, how long?

170
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,535
Seven and a half months.

171
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:56,206
So it's gonna be
born in, like,

172
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:58,215
six weeks or something.

173
00:11:58,317 --> 00:12:00,217
I think so, yeah.

174
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:02,310
I'm trying not
to get too caught up

175
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:03,479
in it right now.

176
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:05,079
Don't tell Francis.

177
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:08,092
Brendan got the wrong voltage.

178
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:10,355
Your soup, sir.

179
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:14,331
Please forgive this.

180
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,808
Hmm.

181
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:27,911
Is it supposed to be sad?

182
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:29,913
I think so.

183
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:32,415
Well, I'm not too crazy
about the part

184
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:34,418
where I start screaming
at the mechanic.

185
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,578
That never happened.

186
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:37,588
The characters are all fictional.

187
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,590
May I take your dessert order, sir?

188
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,057
Let's see.

189
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,525
Do we want sweets or fruit?

190
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:43,686
I'm gonna have the pudding.

191
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:45,229
Jack, you want to try the cake?

192
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:46,798
And, Peter, what looks good to you?

193
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:48,799
The cookies?

194
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:50,801
He's gonna order for himself.

195
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:52,871
The cookies.

196
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:56,231
Excuse me, I'm...

197
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:05,715
Has he been rooting around
and taking things?

198
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:07,217
Maybe.

199
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:08,752
I think he's still in mourning.

200
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:10,685
Well, I probably
am, too, but there's

201
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,520
something kind of unethical
about it, isn't there?

202
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:14,854
Legally those glasses

203
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,894
belong to all three of us.

204
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:40,415
I'm gonna take this bed,

205
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:42,885
because I'm the oldest
and my ankle's fractured.

206
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:45,354
Peter, you don't mind climbing
a ladder as I recall,

207
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:47,357
so why don't you set up shop
topside?

208
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:49,689
And, Jack, you're a little bit
of a lone wolf.

209
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:52,025
Why don't you bunk out next door?

210
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:54,099
How does that sound?

211
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:00,833
Oh, sorry.

212
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,999
I was...
Stand up.

213
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:04,507
Brendan, this is Jack.

214
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,168
Good evening.
-And this is Peter.

215
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:07,506
Hello, Brendan.

216
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:08,637
Nice to meet you.

217
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:09,805
Let's update me.

218
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:12,782
How's everything going back there?

219
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:14,443
Pretty good.
-What does that mean?

220
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:15,815
I never heard back.

221
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:17,548
So try again.
What are you waiting for?

222
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:19,590
Well, I left a message.

223
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,626
Why are you smiling?

224
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:23,092
What do you think
he looks like

225
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,594
under all that tape and everything?

226
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,255
FRANCIS
Brendan, what did I tell you?!

227
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,696
Well, I don't know
about his face,

228
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,734
but I think his brain
might be pretty traumatized.

229
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:30,767
Damn it!

230
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,929
Come down to this spot over here.

231
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,266
Call her again
right now

232
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:35,601
and keep calling
every ten minutes

233
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,107
until you get through.
-Okay.

234
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,437
This is urgent.
We're almost there.

235
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,102
Okay.
-And once again,

236
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,611
so we're explicitly clear,

237
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,045
I don't want you
to mention this

238
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:44,706
or discuss it with anyone.

239
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:46,216
In other words, it's a surprise.

240
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:47,649
Okay.

241
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:49,550
Did you find me a power adapter?

242
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:51,555
Not yet.

243
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:53,557
How long are you gonna stay here?

244
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:55,559
What do you mean?

245
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:57,219
He said till the end of the month.

246
00:14:57,329 --> 00:14:59,229
Uh-huh.

247
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:01,196
Why do you ask that?

248
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,768
I'm just trying to know so
I can figure out my plans.

249
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:05,769
What plans?

250
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:07,270
I don't know yet.

251
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:09,432
Anyways, I've got my own
ticket, just in case.

252
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:11,771
Don't tell Francis.

253
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:14,209
Well, I'm not gonna stay here
with just me and him.

254
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:17,548
Is that one of Alice's pots?

255
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:18,708
Oh.

256
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:20,717
We should order some more of these.

257
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:21,945
I'll tell Brendan.

258
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:23,351
Okay.

259
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:25,616
He has this disease where
his head is shaved,

260
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:27,055
except he doesn't
have to shave it

261
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:29,389
because he can't grow any
hair in the first place.

262
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:32,293
Don't... talk about it
around him, though.

263
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:33,660
It might offend him.

264
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,728
Are these Dad's keys?

265
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,170
Yeah.

266
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:17,674
You've got his car keys, too?

267
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:20,506
Where's those nuts at?

268
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:32,315
I got it, I got it, I got
it, I got it, I got it.

269
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:34,187
Good evening, Mr. Whitman.
How can I help you?

270
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:36,056
Is it possible for us
to get some more

271
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:37,628
of those Savoury Snacks, please?

272
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:38,628
Of course.

273
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:40,096
Can I offer you anything else?

274
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:41,427
Um... I don't think so.

275
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:42,932
I'll be right back.

276
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:45,401
I forgot something.

277
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:34,982
You want to smoke a cigarette
with me in the bathroom?

278
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,025
You're crazy.

279
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:53,195
What's your name?

280
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:55,364
Jack. What's yours?

281
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:56,964
Rita.

282
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,634
You're beautiful.

283
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:01,774
Don't come into me.

284
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,727
Jack's got his own return ticket.

285
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:17,227
He says he might leave early.

286
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:18,626
What are you talking about?

287
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,163
Don't tell him I told you.

288
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:21,823
Brendan's got all the tickets.

289
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,265
There's a whole itinerary.

290
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:24,835
Where is he going?

291
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:32,800
Air Italiano?

292
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:34,606
What the fuck is this?

293
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:36,203
I'm keeping his passport.

294
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:38,249
In fact, give me yours, too.

295
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,977
I want to keep
all the passports

296
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:41,712
so nothing happens to them.

297
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,014
I'm keeping mine.

298
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,590
No. I want to keep
them all together.

299
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:53,691
Why are you standing there?

300
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,391
I'm waiting for you.

301
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:56,900
Mr. Whitman,
the whole point

302
00:18:57,002 --> 00:18:58,264
of us coming
out separately

303
00:18:58,370 --> 00:18:59,803
is so no one sees us together.

304
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:00,929
Jack.

305
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,199
Jack.

306
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,207
Right. I get it. Okay.
Good night, then.

307
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:05,503
Go back to your compartment.

308
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,582
Move over, please.

309
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:21,221
Where are the Savoury Snacks?

310
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:22,793
Huh?

311
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:27,496
Did you just fuck that Indian girl?

312
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:30,192
What?

313
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:32,167
Sweet Lime.

314
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:33,260
Of course not.

315
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:34,964
I went for a walk.

316
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:36,973
Something just happened.

317
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,853
Shh!
-Who's he talking to?

318
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:58,259
No one.
He's got the code

319
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:00,263
to his ex-girlfriend's
answering machine,

320
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,094
and he's checking her messages.

321
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,965
What? When... When did
he confide that to you?

322
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:08,267
Just now.

323
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:10,102
Why am I not a part of this?

324
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:15,644
I've never liked that girl.

325
00:20:15,747 --> 00:20:17,578
Me neither.

326
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:19,947
Anyway, I never trusted her.

327
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:43,641
I don't feel good about myself.

328
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:48,145
Okay. Let's make another agreement.

329
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:51,080
On the spiritual journey,
it's crucial

330
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:52,980
that we don't splinter
into factions

331
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,143
or not include somebody

332
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,686
who has advice and may know better.

333
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:57,755
Can we agree to that?
-Okay.

334
00:20:57,856 --> 00:20:59,619
What did you find out?
-Nothing.

335
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:01,625
Good.

336
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:03,592
She put this in my suitcase.

337
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,724
Is that her?

338
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:11,564
Mm. That's her.

339
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:14,070
How did she gain access
to your personal belongings?

340
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:16,663
She came to see me in
France for 24 hours.

341
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:18,174
Could she be gaslighting you?

342
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:19,505
What's gaslighting?

343
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,078
Okay, hang on a second.

344
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:22,703
Let's make another agreement.

345
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:24,907
From now on,
if you want to talk to her

346
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:28,043
or check her messages,
you speak to us first.

347
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:30,781
Day or night. Anytime.
Can you agree to that?

348
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:34,416
I think we should destroy that.

349
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:40,965
Jesus!

350
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:43,591
Okay. All right.

351
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:45,602
Let's check the itinerary.

352
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,998
Give me a little light.

353
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:52,042
Okay, here we go.

354
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,543
Train stops first thing
tomorrow morning

355
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,203
for an hour and 45 minutes,

356
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,077
which is just enough time
for a quick visit

357
00:21:57,182 --> 00:21:58,581
to Temple of a Thousand Bulls,

358
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:01,050
probably one of
the most spiritual places

359
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,383
in the entire world.

360
00:22:36,555 --> 00:22:38,022
Wow.

361
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:42,059
Power adapters!

362
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,287
Can I get a power adapter?

363
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:46,295
Yes, yes, yes.

364
00:22:46,398 --> 00:22:47,831
Do you have a power adapter?

365
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:49,400
No, no.
No power adapter.

366
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:51,366
Use battery.

367
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:54,633
Do you have these in, say,
a ten-and-a-half medium?

368
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,640
These all size.

369
00:22:56,742 --> 00:22:58,471
Take off shoes and try.

370
00:22:58,577 --> 00:22:59,805
Yeah, like that. That's good.

371
00:22:59,911 --> 00:23:01,811
Pepper spray. What ingredients
does this have in it?

372
00:23:01,913 --> 00:23:03,437
I don't want to kill
anybody or anything.

373
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:04,913
No, no.
Not for killing.

374
00:23:05,016 --> 00:23:06,210
Spray in face.

375
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:07,979
Okay. Spray in face.

376
00:23:08,086 --> 00:23:09,417
Spray in face.

377
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:13,688
Most rare, from desert.

378
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:15,350
Very poisonous.

379
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:18,520
How much you want for him?

380
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:24,669
This is incredible.

381
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:37,275
Ring it.

382
00:23:47,392 --> 00:23:48,916
Take some of these
rupees and put them

383
00:23:49,027 --> 00:23:50,995
on this thing in front
of the deity here.

384
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:00,067
Is that my belt?

385
00:24:02,674 --> 00:24:03,902
Can I borrow it?

386
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:05,067
Well, no, not right now.

387
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:07,145
I was looking for that earlier.

388
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:17,246
Ask first... next time.
-Right.

389
00:24:17,355 --> 00:24:19,755
Where's my passport?

390
00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:21,086
I got pickpocketed.

391
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:22,421
My passport got stolen.

392
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:23,926
Calm down.

393
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:25,360
It's not stolen.
-No, yes, it is.

394
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:27,329
It's gone.
-No, it's not.

395
00:24:27,432 --> 00:24:28,660
I have it.

396
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:29,927
I'll be right back.

397
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:33,769
You stole my passport?

398
00:24:33,872 --> 00:24:35,499
Peter, where are you going?

399
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:39,340
I'm going to go pray
at a different thing.

400
00:24:44,716 --> 00:24:46,946
I hear you're leaving early.

401
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:48,178
What are you talking about?

402
00:24:48,286 --> 00:24:50,117
I thought we made an agreement.

403
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:51,519
That's why you stole my passport?

404
00:24:51,623 --> 00:24:53,386
Well, no, but I think
we have a chance

405
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,426
to make this kind of a
life-changing experience,

406
00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:57,461
and I think we need it.

407
00:24:57,562 --> 00:25:00,531
In other words,
I don't want you to leave.

408
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:03,066
He's going to have a
kid in six weeks.

409
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:04,897
Who?
-Him, Rubby.

410
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:06,868
He doesn't want you to know.
-"Rubby"?

411
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:08,963
Yeah, you know, Rubby.

412
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:12,241
Yeah.

413
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:14,403
Why doesn't he want me to know?

414
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:17,982
Because we don't trust each other.

415
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:23,052
Wow, right?

416
00:25:23,154 --> 00:25:25,588
Yeah, amazing.
-Great, thanks.

417
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,317
Let's get a shoeshine.

418
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:34,658
Oh, hit it.

419
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,529
Hey. Hey, come back here!

420
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,369
What?
-The kid just left...

421
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:44,772
Who?
-He just...

422
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:45,808
Get him!

423
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:47,435
He left his shoeshine kit.
-He...

424
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,104
Well, now he can pay
for this building.

425
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:51,011
Those are $3,000 loafers!

426
00:25:51,116 --> 00:25:52,640
Yeah, but he only got one of them.

427
00:25:52,751 --> 00:25:54,218
Yeah, but that's...

428
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,121
We're in an emergency here.

429
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,691
I got my face smashed in,

430
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:02,384
Jack's heart's been
ripped to shreds,

431
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:04,155
and Rubby's having a child.

432
00:26:04,996 --> 00:26:05,963
Let's get into it.

433
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:07,224
You told him?

434
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:08,663
It's okay.

435
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:10,257
Okay, that's what
we're here for,

436
00:26:10,368 --> 00:26:11,858
to start trusting each other.

437
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,494
I don't get it, by the way.

438
00:26:13,605 --> 00:26:15,903
Why aren't we celebrating?

439
00:26:16,007 --> 00:26:17,702
'Cause I don't want
to talk about it.

440
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:19,902
Well, why not?

441
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,409
I guess because
I always expected

442
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:25,915
eventually I'll get divorced,
so having children...

443
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:27,575
really wasn't part of my plan.

444
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:29,711
Okay, but you're never
gonna do better than Alice,

445
00:26:29,821 --> 00:26:31,220
and what's the point
in getting married...

446
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:33,587
Why'd you expect to get divorced?

447
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:35,660
I don't know.
I love Alice.

448
00:26:37,028 --> 00:26:39,656
Maybe it relates
to how we were raised.

449
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:46,427
I was gonna save this
for later in the itinerary,

450
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:48,768
but I think it's time.

451
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:51,068
There's a ceremony I want
us to do where we each

452
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:53,440
take one of these peacock feathers.

453
00:26:53,545 --> 00:26:54,978
We're gonna go off
into the wilderness

454
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,104
and meditate for...

455
00:26:56,214 --> 00:26:57,772
Damn it, I gave them to Brendan.

456
00:26:57,882 --> 00:27:00,282
That's all right, we'll
do it after the next stop.

457
00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:01,716
Those guys are laughing at us.

458
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,720
Where?

459
00:27:05,657 --> 00:27:07,557
I love it here.

460
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:09,286
These people are beautiful.

461
00:27:10,996 --> 00:27:12,964
They're playing cricket
with a tennis ball.

462
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,236
Hello.

463
00:27:23,341 --> 00:27:25,571
How do you do?
-Hello.

464
00:27:28,346 --> 00:27:29,904
It's great.

465
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:31,744
Yeah?
-Yeah.

466
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:33,010
It's so well-written.

467
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:34,881
You remember everything so clearly.

468
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:37,250
Peter getting all frantic
getting the car started,

469
00:27:37,355 --> 00:27:39,346
you with the suitcase.

470
00:27:39,457 --> 00:27:41,049
The characters are all fictional.

471
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:43,286
Well, anyway,
I think it's the best thing

472
00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:44,919
you've ever written.

473
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,395
Thank you.

474
00:28:04,215 --> 00:28:05,443
Here are the peacock feathers,

475
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:07,108
plus some instructions
from the guru.

476
00:28:07,218 --> 00:28:08,310
What's in that box?

477
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,409
He bought a snake.

478
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:10,647
It's got a skull and crossbones...

479
00:28:10,755 --> 00:28:12,154
Let's update me.

480
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:15,925
Anything?

481
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:17,790
She got the message, yeah.

482
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:18,954
And?

483
00:28:19,064 --> 00:28:19,996
What? That's it.

484
00:28:20,098 --> 00:28:21,690
That's it.
She got the message.

485
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,165
You're satisfied with that?

486
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:25,133
Well, she knows you're coming.

487
00:28:25,236 --> 00:28:27,033
Does she want to see us?

488
00:28:27,138 --> 00:28:29,504
But she's your mother.

489
00:28:41,986 --> 00:28:44,079
Happy birthday...
from last year.

490
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:48,287
I can't accept this.
It's too valuable.

491
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:49,485
It's got one
wrong initial,

492
00:28:49,594 --> 00:28:50,891
but you can paint over it.

493
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:52,053
It's from me and Jack.

494
00:29:14,185 --> 00:29:15,083
Yes?

495
00:29:15,186 --> 00:29:16,346
Would you like tea?

496
00:29:16,454 --> 00:29:17,478
Okay.

497
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,226
Thank you.

498
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:07,895
I got to get off this train.

499
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:24,784
What's her name again?

500
00:30:24,889 --> 00:30:25,913
Rita.

501
00:30:29,227 --> 00:30:31,718
What'd you say?

502
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:38,763
There's a hole in it.

503
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:39,802
He escaped.

504
00:30:39,904 --> 00:30:41,769
No, he didn't.

505
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:43,568
How?

506
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,979
Now-Now you believe me, assholes?

507
00:30:56,187 --> 00:31:00,317
We think a snake might
have gotten on board.

508
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:15,667
Don't go in there, Rita.

509
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:20,609
You got him!

510
00:31:35,293 --> 00:31:37,727
I'm kicking you off
at the next station.

511
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:39,160
Please don't do that.

512
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,788
We're very sorry.
It won't happen again.

513
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,628
I know it won't.

514
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,065
What's that smell?

515
00:31:44,168 --> 00:31:45,658
Voltaire Number Six.

516
00:31:50,775 --> 00:31:52,538
Do you have
a prescription for these?

517
00:31:52,644 --> 00:31:55,738
A prescription?
I almost died.

518
00:31:57,982 --> 00:31:59,006
Give me a second.

519
00:32:10,561 --> 00:32:12,290
That animal's deadly poisonous

520
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:14,024
and you brought him onto my train.

521
00:32:14,132 --> 00:32:15,599
We didn't know.
It was an accident.

522
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:18,066
We're just trying
to experience something.

523
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:22,833
It's very important to us.

524
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:35,284
You're confined
to your compartment

525
00:32:35,386 --> 00:32:36,580
until further notice.

526
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:39,521
Is our snake getting confiscated?

527
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,487
Do you think it's working?

528
00:33:13,591 --> 00:33:15,218
Do we feel something?

529
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:18,056
I hope so.
-It's got to.

530
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:20,656
Do you trust me?

531
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:31,724
Where are we?

532
00:34:56,227 --> 00:34:57,854
Brendan, what's going on?

533
00:34:57,962 --> 00:35:00,726
I don't know. I guess
the train's lost.

534
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:01,992
What'd he say?

535
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,158
He says the train's lost.

536
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:05,167
How can a train be
lost? It's on rails.

537
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:07,430
Apparently we took a wrong
turn at some point last night.

538
00:35:07,538 --> 00:35:08,436
That's crazy.

539
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:09,665
How far off course are we?

540
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,674
Nobody knows-we haven't
located us yet.

541
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:12,936
What'd you just say?

542
00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:13,976
What?

543
00:35:14,078 --> 00:35:15,636
What you just said.
Say it again.

544
00:35:15,746 --> 00:35:16,713
We haven't located us yet.

545
00:35:16,814 --> 00:35:18,076
Aah!

546
00:35:18,182 --> 00:35:19,809
Is that symbolic?

547
00:35:19,917 --> 00:35:24,115
"We... haven't
located... us... yet. "

548
00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:25,553
Where's those feathers at?

549
00:35:25,656 --> 00:35:28,181
In the envelope
I gave you this morning.

550
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:30,419
Meet me on top of
that thing out there.

551
00:35:48,746 --> 00:35:51,772
The guru told me
when the moon turns...

552
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,616
Do you trust me?

553
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,254
I hired a private detective
to track down Mom.

554
00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:08,332
She's living in a convent in
the foothills of the Himalayas.

555
00:36:08,432 --> 00:36:10,024
We'll be there in six days.

556
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,747
How is that possible?

557
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:26,749
I guess she became a nun,
apparently.

558
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:27,840
You know what she's like.

559
00:36:27,952 --> 00:36:28,884
A nun?

560
00:36:28,986 --> 00:36:29,884
Apparently.

561
00:36:29,987 --> 00:36:31,887
Did you talk to her?

562
00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:33,013
No, I didn't.

563
00:36:33,124 --> 00:36:34,352
Does she know we're coming?

564
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:35,925
I think so.

565
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:38,723
How do you know she wants to see us?

566
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:41,821
She probably doesn't.

567
00:36:41,933 --> 00:36:43,332
But maybe she does.

568
00:36:45,836 --> 00:36:47,565
Why didn't you tell us sooner?

569
00:36:47,672 --> 00:36:50,106
Because I'm trying
to protect you

570
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:53,234
from all the painful emotions
this is probably gonna stir up.

571
00:36:53,344 --> 00:36:55,642
Well, aren't you kind of
doing that right now?

572
00:36:55,746 --> 00:36:57,373
Yeah.

573
00:36:57,481 --> 00:36:59,813
I'm scared, too.

574
00:36:59,917 --> 00:37:03,148
She's obviously suffered
some kind of mental collapse

575
00:37:03,254 --> 00:37:05,347
and we've got to go get her
and bring her back home.

576
00:37:06,857 --> 00:37:09,257
Actually, it's in the itinerary,

577
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,294
but I put it under "T.B.D."

578
00:37:13,831 --> 00:37:14,991
Why are you laughing?

579
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:18,224
You didn't tell us
'cause we never

580
00:37:18,336 --> 00:37:19,963
would've come here
if we knew about it.

581
00:37:25,142 --> 00:37:27,576
I'm gonna hold this in
for a little while.

582
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:53,568
You gonna drink that whole
bottle of cough medicine?

583
00:37:53,671 --> 00:37:56,299
That's a dumb way to get loaded.

584
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,577
Let's look at the itinerary.

585
00:38:03,681 --> 00:38:05,706
Fuck the itinerary.

586
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:10,548
You know, I think I'm gonna have
to get that belt back after all.

587
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:14,386
Because it cost me $6,000
and it was made special for me.

588
00:38:15,993 --> 00:38:17,483
We'll get you a different present.

589
00:38:17,595 --> 00:38:19,028
I don't think so.

590
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,189
What is that supposed to mean?

591
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:24,097
It means there's been too much
Indian giving over the years.

592
00:38:30,508 --> 00:38:32,373
These guys are driving me crazy.

593
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:34,341
Is there an empty compartment
I can move into?

594
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:38,540
No, there isn't.
We're fully booked.

595
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:41,345
I really want to kiss you
right now. Can I?

596
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:46,551
No.

597
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,249
No?

598
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:51,021
But we already... did it.

599
00:38:51,128 --> 00:38:52,095
I have a boyfriend.

600
00:38:52,196 --> 00:38:53,857
You do?

601
00:38:53,964 --> 00:38:56,797
Actually, I just broke up with him.

602
00:38:56,901 --> 00:38:58,425
Or I'm about to.

603
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:03,069
I really need someone
to talk to right now.

604
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:06,405
And I feel like you might be
very important to me in my life.

605
00:39:09,213 --> 00:39:10,305
All right.

606
00:39:26,897 --> 00:39:27,955
What did I tell you?

607
00:39:28,065 --> 00:39:29,396
Get back in your room.

608
00:39:33,504 --> 00:39:34,937
What's happening?
-What do you mean?

609
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:36,904
I rang the bell.
-I'll be right there.

610
00:39:50,154 --> 00:39:53,146
Is that Dad's razor?

611
00:39:53,257 --> 00:39:54,246
Yeah.

612
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:55,848
Can I say something?

613
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,291
What?

614
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:59,522
You don't have permission
to take his property

615
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:01,860
that belongs to all of us
and use it for yourself

616
00:40:01,966 --> 00:40:03,024
as if it's yours.

617
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:04,897
Jack agrees with that.
Right, Jack?

618
00:40:05,002 --> 00:40:07,232
Plus, Dad would've hated it.

619
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:08,327
Why?

620
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:09,667
That's my opinion.

621
00:40:09,774 --> 00:40:11,105
I knew him well.

622
00:40:12,943 --> 00:40:14,376
That's a terrible thing to say.

623
00:40:14,478 --> 00:40:15,809
Well, I don't mean it to be.

624
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:17,676
I just don't want you
to get the feeling

625
00:40:17,782 --> 00:40:19,545
that you're better friends
with him than we are

626
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:21,117
or something weird like that.

627
00:40:21,218 --> 00:40:23,152
And, also, you can't
leave your wife

628
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:24,312
just because she's pregnant.

629
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:26,390
Jack agrees with that, too.
Right, Jack?

630
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:28,424
Stop including me.

631
00:40:28,526 --> 00:40:30,323
I was his favorite.

632
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,988
He told me that with blood all
over him laying in the street

633
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,394
right before he died.

634
00:40:37,301 --> 00:40:39,963
How is that supposed
to make us feel?

635
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:44,038
I want my passport back.

636
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:46,234
Francis?

637
00:40:46,343 --> 00:40:47,605
Yeah?

638
00:40:47,711 --> 00:40:49,008
Here's your belt.

639
00:40:58,923 --> 00:41:00,891
Fuck. Stop!

640
00:41:13,404 --> 00:41:15,235
You don't love me!
-Yes, I do!

641
00:41:15,339 --> 00:41:17,239
I love you, too, but I'm gonna
mace you in the face!

642
00:41:17,341 --> 00:41:18,740
Stop!

643
00:41:25,749 --> 00:41:26,773
I had to do it!

644
00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:28,374
Jack!
You maced us!

645
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:33,552
Stop including me!

646
00:41:55,212 --> 00:41:56,611
I'll find us a hotel.

647
00:41:56,714 --> 00:41:58,614
Next train's in 24 hours.

648
00:41:58,716 --> 00:42:00,650
This just came in.

649
00:42:00,751 --> 00:42:02,742
Why are your eyes all red?

650
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:05,344
Why is your head so bald?

651
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:07,549
Because I have alopecia.

652
00:42:07,658 --> 00:42:09,091
Oh, yeah.

653
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:12,094
That's like albino, right?

654
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:14,221
Not really.

655
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:16,299
Jack maced us.

656
00:42:25,242 --> 00:42:26,607
Was I just mean to Brendan?

657
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:28,302
He's not coming back.

658
00:42:28,412 --> 00:42:29,743
He just quit.

659
00:42:29,847 --> 00:42:32,111
He did, didn't he?

660
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:33,740
Can we at least get our snake back?

661
00:42:33,851 --> 00:42:35,409
It's dead.

662
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:37,146
You killed him?

663
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:41,554
Your fake tooth's gone.

664
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:43,559
Fuck.

665
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:46,894
What did you say?

666
00:42:46,997 --> 00:42:48,760
Shame on you.

667
00:42:54,138 --> 00:42:55,730
Did you get maced, too?

668
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:59,275
No, I'm crying.

669
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:11,019
What's wrong with you?

670
00:43:13,123 --> 00:43:14,590
Let me think about that.

671
00:43:14,692 --> 00:43:16,592
I'll tell you
the next time I see you.

672
00:43:16,694 --> 00:43:20,221
Sure, tell me then.

673
00:43:22,499 --> 00:43:24,296
Thanks for using me.

674
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:32,372
You're welcome.

675
00:43:37,548 --> 00:43:39,778
Good-bye, Rita.

676
00:43:39,883 --> 00:43:41,908
So long, Sweet Lime.

677
00:44:22,726 --> 00:44:24,057
"Dear boys... "

678
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:25,594
<i>Bad timing.</i>

679
00:44:25,696 --> 00:44:27,994
<i>This morning I received the
details of your travel plans</i>

680
00:44:28,098 --> 00:44:31,590
<i>in a document sent to me
from a man named Brendan.</i>

681
00:44:31,702 --> 00:44:33,567
<i>Unfortunately,
I cannot receive you now.</i>

682
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:36,196
<i>A neighboring village requires
our urgent assistance</i>

683
00:44:36,306 --> 00:44:38,604
<i>due to an emergency,
not to mention the recent</i>

684
00:44:38,709 --> 00:44:41,337
<i>arrival of a man-eating tiger
in the region.</i>

685
00:44:41,445 --> 00:44:42,878
<i>I suggest you come
in the spring</i>

686
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:44,504
<i>when you'll be safe with me.</i>

687
00:44:44,615 --> 00:44:46,207
<i>You must know how sad I am</i>

688
00:44:46,316 --> 00:44:48,546
<i>to experience this long separation.</i>

689
00:44:48,652 --> 00:44:51,485
<i>I hope you'll eventually
understand and forgive me.</i>

690
00:44:51,588 --> 00:44:54,318
<i>God bless you and keep you with
Mary's benevolent guidance</i>

691
00:44:54,425 --> 00:44:56,290
<i>in the light of Christ's
enduring grace.</i>

692
00:44:56,393 --> 00:44:58,554
<i>All my love, your mother,</i>

693
00:44:58,662 --> 00:45:00,721
<i>Sister Patricia Whitman.</i>

694
00:45:00,831 --> 00:45:02,822
That sounds like bullshit to me.

695
00:45:02,933 --> 00:45:04,366
Me, too.
Obviously.

696
00:45:04,468 --> 00:45:07,130
She's trying to sell us
a vacuum cleaner.

697
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,211
Let's get high.

698
00:45:35,833 --> 00:45:36,993
I'm sorry.

699
00:45:39,703 --> 00:45:40,829
Me, too.

700
00:45:40,938 --> 00:45:42,735
I wasn't trying to aim
for your face.

701
00:45:45,375 --> 00:45:48,674
Doesn't matter,
it's already demolished.

702
00:45:48,779 --> 00:45:50,303
Let's just go home.

703
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:51,938
She doesn't want to see us anyway.

704
00:45:52,049 --> 00:45:55,041
You don't think so?

705
00:45:55,152 --> 00:45:57,052
Not even on some primordial level?

706
00:45:57,154 --> 00:45:59,554
No.

707
00:45:59,656 --> 00:46:02,750
She's been disappearing all our lives.

708
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:07,092
We weren't raised
to be treated like that.

709
00:46:07,197 --> 00:46:09,165
It's just not done.

710
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:12,758
Maybe this is how
it's supposed to happen.

711
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:14,997
It could all be part of it.

712
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:18,871
Maybe this is where the
spiritual journey ends.

713
00:46:26,183 --> 00:46:27,172
You read the instructions,

714
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:28,911
right?

715
00:46:32,356 --> 00:46:34,381
Okay, let's do it.

716
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:38,355
I'm gonna go over here.

717
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:40,487
Yeah, g... that's good,
get on the rock. Yeah.

718
00:46:40,597 --> 00:46:42,326
Yeah. Yeah, okay.
-Peter, you get... Yeah.

719
00:46:42,432 --> 00:46:43,990
Everybody ready?
-Yeah. -Yeah.

720
00:46:44,101 --> 00:46:45,432
Ah! Oh!
-Shalom.

721
00:46:49,873 --> 00:46:52,467
Okay, that's it.
That's it.

722
00:46:52,576 --> 00:46:53,702
Okay.

723
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:55,779
Well, all right.

724
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:08,721
Which direction did yours go?

725
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:09,986
What do you mean?

726
00:47:10,093 --> 00:47:11,321
Your feathers.

727
00:47:11,428 --> 00:47:12,895
Mine blew towards the mountains.

728
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:15,556
That's not right-it's
not supposed to get blown away.

729
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:17,930
<i>You're supposed
to blow on it...</i>

730
00:47:18,035 --> 00:47:19,400
And then bury it.

731
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:20,800
I didn't get that.

732
00:47:20,904 --> 00:47:22,428
I still have mine.

733
00:47:22,539 --> 00:47:23,938
You guys didn't do it right.

734
00:47:24,041 --> 00:47:25,941
I asked you
if you read the instructions.

735
00:47:26,043 --> 00:47:28,637
You did it wrong.

736
00:47:31,415 --> 00:47:33,940
I tried my hardest.

737
00:47:34,051 --> 00:47:36,815
I don't know what else to do.

738
00:47:39,289 --> 00:47:42,554
I don't think Dad
would have hated it.

739
00:47:42,659 --> 00:47:45,423
Did he really say
you were his favorite?

740
00:47:46,496 --> 00:47:47,758
I don't know.

741
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:49,560
I could barely understand him.

742
00:47:49,666 --> 00:47:51,827
He wasn't really breathing.

743
00:47:51,935 --> 00:47:53,664
I wonder if the three of us

744
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:55,965
could have been friends
in real life.

745
00:47:56,073 --> 00:47:58,564
Not as brothers but as people.

746
00:47:58,675 --> 00:48:02,338
Well, we probably would've had
a better chance, I guess.

747
00:48:05,182 --> 00:48:06,911
Let's make another agreement:

748
00:48:07,017 --> 00:48:09,178
We'll all come back here
in the spring when...

749
00:48:09,286 --> 00:48:11,550
We're never coming back here.

750
00:48:11,655 --> 00:48:14,954
Let's just find an airport
and go our separate ways.

751
00:48:17,794 --> 00:48:20,661
Wouldn't it sound great
if you could hear a train

752
00:48:20,764 --> 00:48:23,665
going by off in the
distance right now?

753
00:48:23,767 --> 00:48:26,395
Not really.
-Probably be annoying.

754
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:46,218
Look at these assholes.

755
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:52,793
That's gonna tip over.

756
00:48:55,666 --> 00:48:56,655
Go!

757
00:49:02,806 --> 00:49:04,433
Get the little one.

758
00:49:05,175 --> 00:49:07,040
Francis!

759
00:49:07,144 --> 00:49:09,169
Grab him!

760
00:49:12,149 --> 00:49:15,175
Don't let go of me.

761
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:16,946
He's all tangled up.

762
00:49:17,946 --> 00:49:27,946
