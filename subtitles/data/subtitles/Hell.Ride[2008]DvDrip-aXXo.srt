2
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:33,290
Safe-keep the treasure.

3
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:37,810
I know you'll keep your word baby.

4
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:43,590
Safe-keep the treasure for my boy.

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,850
Keep safe, the treasure. For my boy

6
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:49,930
Fucking

7
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:12,990
Fucking arrow.

8
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:17,550
Fucking arrow in the middle of the fucking desert.

9
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:23,590
It's a nihilist dream come true.

10
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,900
It's a hell of a place to die.

11
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,590
It's a hell of a way to die.

12
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,660
It was goddamn perfect.

13
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:42,610
Shut up.

14
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:48,560
You want a swing of this whiskey before I pull that arrow?

15
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:52,540
It's my destiny to die right here with a fucking
arrow sticking out of me.

16
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:55,830
With any luck The Gent and Comanche will die laughing.

17
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,890
Guess I'm gonna live another day.

18
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:11,590
*chuckles*

19
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,220
You got that right.

20
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:16,610
Ah hell.

21
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,660
Fucker's gonna burn.

22
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,230
Come on! Hey! Hey!

23
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,360
Heeyyyy!

24
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,270
This might be the best dust I've ever seen.

25
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:30,980
Pistol, I've been up to my ass in dust plenty of times, but...

26
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:34,560
This kinda dust is like a supreme kind of dust.

27
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:37,650
It's like been sent from some other planet.

28
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,530
It's like, I just want to live in dust now for the rest of my life.

29
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,000
Shut the fuck up!

30
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,650
Where's Comanche?

31
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,510
He's over there taking a piss.

32
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:57,490
He doesn't wanna get any dust on his dick.

33
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,520
When we ride, move him up to my left.

34
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,000
You're name is Bix?

35
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,570
Forget Bix.

36
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:15,960
From now on, you're known as Comanche.

37
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:30,040
"Had they really nailed everyone responsible

38
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,100
for St. Louie's death?" 

39
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,860
Thought Pistolero.

40
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:47,380
Sorry, my finger got stuck

41
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:51,410
Next time, share a little.

42
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:10,130
The Six-Six-Six'ers...

43
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,750
They're back.

44
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:15,420
Something is rotten in the State of Pistolero.

45
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:23,860
*grunting* Motherfucker!

46
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:28,490
So I say...

47
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,170
Cut off their heads, take 'em with us. 

48
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,440
I say we just take a few pinkies and...

49
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:36,590
Call it a day.

50
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,500
How's about we take their stash, torch the trailer
and get the fuck out of here.

51
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,570
Why don't you put a smile on your face.

52
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:01,510
Let some sunshine in.

53
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,060
Life is good.

54
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:09,850
You're having a bad hair day, ask Comanche to take
a little off the top.

55
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,020
Thanks for that.

56
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:24,500
Danke schön, for the second-hand smoke.

57
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:28,080
You got right on the edge there.

58
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,150
Closer than a hair on a nad's ass

59
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:34,590
On the verge of the brink?
- Yeah.

60
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:38,030
Reading the situation exactly right...

61
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,870
Is how come I'm the Pres.

62
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,990
Hey Comanche, listen...

63
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:53,120
Pistolero...

64
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:56,580
Wanted me to pass on some important information to you.

65
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:01,000
There's a job opening at Super Cuts

66
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:03,330
About two and a half miles up the road

67
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:06,690
Those mutherfuckers had it coming.

68
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:08,640
Yeah.

69
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:11,170
Louie really was a fucking saint.
- Yeah

70
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:15,250
I'm gonna keep cutting up any motherfucker
that had anything to do with him dying.

71
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,660
Trigger...

72
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:20,240
You named your bike after a horse?

73
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:21,920
Exactly...

74
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,730
How old is Trigger in...

75
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:25,510
Horse-bike years?

76
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:29,950
Uhh... She's younger than the women I saw you
in that bar in Reno last week.

77
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,450
I gotta tell you, she's less horsie-looking too.

78
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:38,510
Pistolero wants you on his left.

79
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:46,070
Speechless ey?

80
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:56,270
The left, huh?

81
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:59,780
I've never seen anybody move up so fast before.

82
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:02,080
And I'll do my best to remember that.

83
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,330
Anything you want to get off your chest.

84
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:07,000
Anything you want to talk about.
Just think of us as a...

85
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,240
Support group.

86
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,970
Well, golly gee.

87
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,640
Thanks!

88
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:20,820
Lets get the fuck out of this motherfucking hellhole!

89
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,000
Bob the Bum...

90
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:38,810
We...

91
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,660
Are...

92
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:42,190
Financially...

93
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,600
Solvent.

94
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:46,920
Bob the Bum. It's good to be financially solvent!

95
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:52,800
Hey, can we talk?

96
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:56,900
Can we talk? You wanna talk?
- Yeah, it's... kinda important.

97
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:02,520
Now?
- Yeah, it's... kinda like, real fucking important.

98
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:06,860
Can't it wait a couple of hours, you bum?

99
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,460
Yeah, we'll talk in about a month and a half.

100
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:14,620
It was America's Bicentennial.

101
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,580
And for Johnny,

102
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:19,500
St. Louie, and Eddie Zero...

103
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,770
Rebellion was still in the air.

104
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:29,960
Sonny!

105
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:21,100
The three Victors had a little business
with the Deuce and Billy Wings.

106
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:26,610
It was the beginning of bad blood.

107
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,260
Wanna fuck?

108
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:53,790
Trust me, after I give you the bad news

109
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:58,480
You ain't gonna wanna fuck. Ever. Again.

110
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:07,240
Fuck me good one more time, 
before you never wanna fuck again.

111
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:11,280
I'm the Messenger of Misery, baby.

112
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:14,270
But fuck first

113
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,490
Then I'll deliver my miserable message.

114
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,740
Let's fuck right here.

115
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,650
We never fucked right here before.

116
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:47,640
Fuck me good, right here baby.

117
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:53,520
If you don't fuck me right now,
you are going straight to Hell.

118
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:56,290
Baby... I'm already in Hell.

119
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:59,320
Apparantely I made a reservation this morning. 

120
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:02,150
Did you make a reservation for two?

121
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,760
It's a very strict dress code in Hell.

122
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,350
You know, you just can't waltz into Hell.

123
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,000
There's a doorman outside.
- Baby...

124
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,330
I was built for Hell.

125
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:16,840
I'm your devil babe

126
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:21,450
I'm your very own, personal hellcat.

127
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:27,270
Hellhole.

128
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,140
Baby, you're good.

129
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:50,470
Baby, you're bad!

130
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:54,270
Give me the info.

131
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,430
Can I ask you something first?

132
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:59,030
Go ahead.

133
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:03,220
Just what kind of fucking President are ya?

134
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,690
Everybody wants you assassinated.

135
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:09,180
Maybe you don't belong in the Presidential Suite.

136
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,580
I'm better than the CIA,

137
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,900
Better than the Internet, better than the Enquire.

138
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,690
I'm better than all of them put together.

139
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:21,830
I've gathered more intelligence 
than anyone you've ever met.

140
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,520
I'm better than deep throat.

141
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:32,220
Give me the fucking info.

142
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:41,030
Okay...

143
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:45,790
The Six-Six-Six'ers are reforming 
in the City of Angels.

144
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:48,760
The Deuce and Billy Wings are back

145
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:50,390
with a vengeance.

146
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,140
Always pay your debts to Billy Wings.

147
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:15,510
Late last night a message was sent to all
Hellraisers that said,

148
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:17,770
"The Deuce would like life a lot better"

149
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,910
"If he was living in Victors' territory."

150
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:22,250
Give me something new, yah?

151
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,470
This whole Deuce-business

152
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,140
Has something to do with 1976.

153
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:34,060
Something to do with that Cherokee Kisum woman.

154
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:38,600
That's all I wanted to hear.

155
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,460
Now we fuck.

156
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:09,030
Get much out of Opium yet?

157
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,290
Yep.

158
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,800
Flowing red in there. Blood alley.

159
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:14,630
What do you got so far?

160
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,420
How much can you live with?

161
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:19,420
I can stomach anything. I got a stomach.

162
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:21,310
Speed and Machete, are tied to the Deuce.

163
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,820
Were. They're finito. 
Goody Two-Shoes just called in.

164
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,910
You know, Speed and the Six-Six-Six'ers,
They set up the St. Louie crack-by.

165
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:31,070
With Opium.

166
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,960
The Six-Six-Six'ers are definitely coming at us.

167
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,670
Deuce and Billy Wings are coming.

168
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:40,640
Meet me tomorrow. In Tuscon. Dani's Inferno.

169
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:43,060
3PM. You got that?

170
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:44,670
Yeah.

171
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:15,660
How much did the Deuce pay you
to set off St. Louie?

172
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:19,730
Stand up?

173
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,040
I'm sorry. 

174
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,590
Please...

175
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:45,220
Right from the start
I treated you like a son.

176
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,870
Oh well...

177
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,990
Family isn't everything.

178
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:54,640
No no, no...

179
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:59,230
Where's the Deuce, Doc?

180
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:07,650
And where's Pistolero?

181
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:15,340
I guess I'm just a fuck-up Billy.

182
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,980
Yes, you are.

183
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:23,170
And I guess I won't be needing your services anymore.

184
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,160
You're off the payroll Doc.

185
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:57,210
Hello Gigi.
- Hey

186
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,240
Hey.

187
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:03,050
Tell Yvonne that the Victors are gonna seize
the VIP table.

188
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,530
Bring over some beer.
- Well if our beer don't kill you

189
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:08,850
It'll sure make you piss stronger.

190
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:12,120
I got the Cowboy.

191
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:14,160
text 191

192
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,780
Bitch!
- Slut!

193
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:23,310
Yeah?!

194
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,090
Hi Gent.

195
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:32,750
Nice.

196
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,940
Hello

197
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,420
Hey, how many of these fucking 

198
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:39,680
Oily little Devils you bang anyway, man?
199
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:41,680
Yvonne!

200
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:43,570
You snuck up on me didn't you?

201
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,110
Uh, gentlemen, this is Yvonne.

202
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:48,520
The future... Mrs. Gent.

203
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:50,870
Yeah, we won't be shopping for furniture
anytime soon. 

204
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,420
What happened?

205
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:54,420
Oh, you introduced Gigi as the...

206
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:56,480
future Mrs. Gent last month.

207
00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:58,020
*muttering*

208
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:01,340
I forgot.

209
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:03,940
To the next Mrs. Gent.

210
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:06,240
Oh and when you're done.

211
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:08,130
Come to my office.

212
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,050
We're having a private party.
- I'm fucking there.

213
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,570
Right now.
- These guys are animals.

214
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:15,770
Why we gotta wait?

215
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,760
Bitch!

216
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:20,050
Okay, you're out!

217
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:22,150
text 217

218
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:24,970
And you're out! 

219
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,630
Hey!
- Pistolero

220
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:29,830
Kept his word.

221
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,510
He made a vow

222
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:33,250
To the Three B's:

223
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:36,960
Bikes, Beer and Booty.

224
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,570
We could be rich, man.

225
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,350
You know... I'm talking about Four B's.

226
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,670
Bikes, Beer, Booty and Big Bucks, man!

227
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:51,150
That's actually fucking 5 B's. Right there.

228
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:53,990
Listen, there's a lot of dough to be had out there.

229
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:58,310
All right? Deuce. the Six-Six-Six'ers.

230
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:00,310
They're the fucking future.

231
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:03,430
Pistolero... He's the ou

232
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,330
All I know.

233
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,340
Is I'd battle Satan for Pistol.

234
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,350
A little fucking redundant don't you think?
- You know what? Fuck you.

235
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:16,110
Fuck you.

236
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,680
Fuck me?

237
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:20,650
Hey, fuck both you guys man.
I'm headed in there right now

238
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,180
And fucking wrestling those bitches.

239
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:23,790
Hey! Ape shit!

240
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:26,870
Well, fuck it. If I have to help him
I have to help that sweet little Devil.

241
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:29,910
Come on 

242
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:31,670
text 242

243
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:38,210
Come on in.

244
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:40,200
Oh man.
- Shit.

245
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,860
Hey, hey!
- Yeah

246
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:44,170
That was some good shit.
- You see me...

247
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:47,020
Where's all them oily pussies at anyway man?

248
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,470
The oily bird gets the worm.

249
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,840
Meet me at Tuscon tomorrow, at 6 o'clock.

250
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:02,790
Dani's Inferno.

251
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:21,320
Ladies are not welcome, except on Ladies' Night.

252
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:24,200
I got a sit-down with the Sixers.

253
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:26,410
Well...

254
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,970
The fucking Sixers ain't here.

255
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,620
This better not be one long fucking ride
for nothing, man.

256
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:36,020
Well, I gotta take a piss.

257
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,200
Where's your head?

258
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:42,750
Well, the Ladies' room is closed, 
'cept for Ladies' Night.

259
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:54,290
Now you got a .38

260
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,680
pointed at your head.

261
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,190
You give me your colors, you little pisser.

262
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:05,370
Or there's gonna be one unvictorious Victor.

263
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,380
What are you gonna do...

264
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:13,360
With these eight other little pissers, when I don't.

265
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:16,760
Well, I'm gonna, I'm gonna wine 'em and dine 'em.

266
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,570
I'm gonna, show 'em Paris.

267
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:24,700
You oughta see how I'm gonna buy them off.

268
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,640
You know.

269
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,280
You have to accept the fact that...

270
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:36,510
The Brotherhood of Bikers is bullshit.

271
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:42,800
The Three B's: Bikers, Brotherhood, Bullshit.

272
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:47,670
You ever do anything but yak?

273
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,170
You half-witty piss-poor shitwit nitwit?

274
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,700
Take us, to the fucking Sixers!

275
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:58,460
Sure thing, man.

276
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:00,490
Come on. No probleme.

277
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,900
How long do you have that bike.

278
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:12,910
Since 1976.

279
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:16,930
Follow me if you can!

280
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,660
He's fucking with us man!

281
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:10,330
Relax.

282
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:12,620
I know this desert like the back of my hand.

283
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:15,720
You just keep me in sight.

284
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,640
This guy's a fucking clown.

285
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,410
Listen to me, we catch that old motherfucker?

286
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:27,360
Let's whack that Indian motherfucker too.

287
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:29,130
We don't need him no more.

288
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:31,430
And I know who's side I'm on. The Deuce.

289
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:33,630
Fucking copasetic by me.

290
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,990
I'm with you man.

291
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:38,760
The Deuce. The Six-Six-Sixers. Billy Wings!

292
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:52,330
Ladies you shouldn't ride Indians.

293
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:54,750
Except on Ladies' Night.

294
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,380
Now...

295
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,610
Put your balls on ice.

296
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:04,420
Get some info out of him first.

297
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:07,250
Before we send him to the 
happy hunting grounds.

298
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:10,190
*muttering*

299
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:20,370
I hope you got insurance old man.

300
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:25,650
Be cool sonny boy.

301
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:28,030
Greetings from Pistolero.

302
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:41,040
Hehe

303
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,780
Noone said nothing to me about

304
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:54,040
Nobody pissing on my boots.

305
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,550
And I'm gonna tell Johnny Pissed-Off

306
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:58,980
That I'm lots more pissed off than him.

307
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:01,130
Comanche,

308
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:03,330
Meet Eddie Zero.

309
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:25,870
Now give me hand with this.

310
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:28,520
'Cause I got things to go and places to do.

311
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:30,130
Come on.

312
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,580
Perfect.

313
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:41,510
Don't say that.

314
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:43,840
The day that it's perfect, 


315
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,890
Is your last day on Earth.

316
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:57,700
Hell is gonna get a hell of a lot worse.

317
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,780
I think I finally found Cherokee Kisum's boy.

318
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,950
The ones who killed Cherokee Kisum...

319
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:09,540
Killed St. Louie too.

320
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:39,500
The Gent.
- That's me.

321
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:43,180
Pistolero would like to chat 
with you and Comanche.

322
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:46,570
Well thanks for the latest breaking 
news there, Wolf Blitzer

323
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:49,280
Dani's Inferno at 6 o'clock.

324
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:51,230
Stay off the main highways

325
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:53,290
The Sixers are cruising around.

326
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:55,660
Listen, it's dangerous as hell out here.

327
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,070
How are you doing - weaponry-wise?

328
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:02,790
What are you some kind of... 
Bike-to-bike salesman?

329
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,610
I'm Eddie Zero, man...

330
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,570
I thought Eddie Zero got killed in a 
big rig crash in '86.

331
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,740
Yeah... I wish. 

332
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:14,150
Well them him, Pistolero...

333
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:16,890
That I need to have a chat with him

334
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,680
Before the other chat.

335
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:21,370
About this asshole habit of him.

336
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:23,520
Concealing shit from me.

337
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:25,860
Tell him your-fucking-self, man.

338
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:46,840
My pussy's on fire.

339
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,320
Your thoughtfulness has given me the burning rush.

340
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,060
I'd like to have the fire marshal arrive on the scene.

341
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:01,450
Extinguish the fire, Mr. Fire Chief.

342
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:06,590
How about we get that firehose out?

343
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,100
Fire drill...

344
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,590
Fire-buck me.

345
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,590
First the Fire Chief takes a ride into the desert

346
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,480
Then I put out the fire.

347
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:22,260
What kind of Fire Department is this?

348
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:25,660
Fire-resistant.
-Fire-retardent if you ask me.

349
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:29,000
You ain't the only fire truck in town you know.
Maybe I'll go fire insurance.

350
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:32,540
That kind of talk won't get you anywhere with me.
I'm fire-proof.

351
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:37,130
Did you bring the Peyote?
I got some thinking to do.

352
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:47,530
Here's a little reading material.

353
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,150
That's a lot of trees, baby.

354
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:00,890
Six hundred and sixty-six pages.

355
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,770
Maybe when I get back...

356
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:07,180
Your fire boy might just do a little 
professional fire-eating.

357
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:10,100
Now you're talking Mr. Fire Boy.

358
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:44,930
I know you'll keep your word, baby.

359
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:49,680
Safekeep the treasure. For my boy.

360
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:21,280
Portable Pistolero!

361
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:26,960
Your asshole behaviour looks good all written down.

362
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,300
It's extential, but sexy. 

363
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:31,390
It's sexistential!

364
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:35,370
And it's not just the Peyote talking.

365
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:40,050
Lets get the fireworks started.
I got to be moving on.

366
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,430
It's done. Finito.

367
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,460
Do whatever you want with it when I'm dead.

368
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:46,010
It's your annuity.

369
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,310
I want you to drop those pants.

370
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:52,580
Sit back and relax.
And watch my tongue fight fire with fire.

371
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:56,620
Can we have a little fire-side chat 
after you're done tongueing me?

372
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:00,620
How's about we have a little fire-side chat
while I'm tongueing you?

373
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:02,640
We'll kill two birds with one tongue?

374
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:04,740
Are you 86'ing me?

375
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:07,270
You're not a pussy-eater.

376
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,610
You never ate my pussy. Not once.

377
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:11,520
Why, all of a sudden?

378
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,150
Nobody dumps me.

379
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,780
I'm the one that does the 86'ing!

380
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:27,340
You fucking need to get that Cherokee Kisum out of your gut.

381
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,380
Once and for all!

382
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,980
Oh!

383
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:33,660
Jesus!

384
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:40,860
Puta Madre!

385
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:45,710
Bury me near St. Louie.

386
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,690
At the cactus flower.

387
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:52,880
Safekeep the treasure. For the boy.

388
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,210
Can I get you anything Deuce?

389
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,660
text 389

390
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:09,900
You must be The Gent?

391
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:12,740
What tipped you off?

392
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:14,480
The outfit?

393
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:17,590
I'm known as Dani around these parts.

394
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,470
I'm a friend of Pistolero's

395
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,780
Is that a fact?

396
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:26,150
Kind of a dangerous thing to be nowadays isn't it?

397
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:32,630
What's your pleasure?

398
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,020
Booze-wise?

399
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:37,830
What's your nationality?

400
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,870
Born in the US of A.

401
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:43,720
I'm part Irish, part Italian, ..

402
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:46,140
text 402

403
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:51,010
I must say, God bless America.

404
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,970
And Goddammit, I'll have an American beer.

405
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,540
You got it.

406
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:02,440
What a country.

407
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:09,610
Thank you. What should we drink to?

408
00:44:09,770 --> 00:44:12,560
Christopher Columbus! 
- To Amerigo Vespucci.

409
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:16,330
Hey!

410
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,370
Why'd you fly the coup?

411
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:20,730
That wasn't part of the fucking plan.

412
00:44:20,970 --> 00:44:23,490
We were supposed to talk to Pistolero together.

413
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,710
After... He got done fucking.

414
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:31,240
It'd be a whole lot easier to explain if 
you didn't have that gun pointed at my face.

415
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,500


416
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:49,320
My life used to be a...

417
00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:51,470
Bike & Booty epic. 

418
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:54,930
Because of you and Pistolero it's turned into a whopper.

419
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:56,660
Of a Chopper Opera.

420
00:44:56,710 --> 00:44:58,230
Well, if you'd like

421
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,060
I could turn your life into an Operetta.

422
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:10,340
Why'd you hit me with that bottle.

423
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,430
How many of these do you got?

424
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:22,340
Just one. 

425
00:45:22,850 --> 00:45:24,350
And I just used it up.

426
00:45:24,550 --> 00:45:26,270
Yes, you did son.

427
00:45:28,850 --> 00:45:30,350
Order a beer.

428
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:33,820
Well, what do you got?
- What do you want?

429
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:36,780
Around here, we drink...

430
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:38,990
American beer!

431
00:45:51,830 --> 00:45:53,890
American it is then.

432
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:07,560
I want to make a suggestion where you 
can stick all your sticks.

433
00:46:07,630 --> 00:46:10,300
Nobody's gonna stop you.
- What the fuck!

434
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:13,270
Implementing a plan to safe the day?!

435
00:46:13,650 --> 00:46:15,950
All you've been doing is running around
collecting girls' phone numbers.

436
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,910
Come on, fucker!

437
00:46:31,270 --> 00:46:32,770


438
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:38,090
Go easy.

439
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:39,630
Apache uprising.

440
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:43,640
Medicine woman saved my life after she almost killed me.

441
00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:47,100
Beer?

442
00:46:47,150 --> 00:46:48,650
Yeah.

443
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:58,160
Which asshole are you betting on?

444
00:46:58,950 --> 00:47:01,840
I'm betting you're a bigger asshole than
the two of them put together

445
00:47:02,270 --> 00:47:03,950
I'll drink to that.

446
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,860
To the President of Assholes.

447
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,990
It took me years to figure out if you were a good guy...

448
00:47:12,150 --> 00:47:13,890
Or a bad guy...

449
00:47:14,350 --> 00:47:16,410
Is that good thing? Or a bad thing?

450
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,790
It's how come I'm the Pres.

451
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:23,950
I'm gonna kill the two of you

452
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,670
soon as you wear yourselves out a little more.

453
00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:30,650
Rope-a-dopes!

454
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:42,020
You know, my life used to be...

455
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:45,830
One long biker party.

456
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:48,790
All the pussy was wide open and

457
00:47:48,850 --> 00:47:50,350
The whiskey was flowing.

458
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:53,720
Now it seems my...

459
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:55,850
Life has turned into some kind of a...

460
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:58,780
Psycho symphony.

461
00:47:58,810 --> 00:48:02,550
A symphony in six hundred and sixty-six movements.

462
00:48:03,610 --> 00:48:07,660
A six hundred and sixty-six cc psycho symphony,

463
00:48:07,970 --> 00:48:11,750
With no intermezzos.
- SHUT THE FUCK UP!

464
00:48:13,010 --> 00:48:17,190
What the hell were you two assholes thinking?

465
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:21,210
Dani, can I be alone with my two assholes?

466
00:48:26,290 --> 00:48:27,790
No Victor...

467
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:29,730
Does any business...

468
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:33,010
Without getting the go-ahead from me first.

469
00:48:33,130 --> 00:48:37,650
You told us, to never-ever bother you, 
when you were fucking!

470
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:41,730
I had everything covered.

471
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:44,640
Infiltrators. Rats!

472
00:48:44,930 --> 00:48:47,080
Benedict Arnolds up the ass!

473
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:48,760
I had us covered!

474
00:48:48,790 --> 00:48:51,140
You had -you- covered!

475
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:55,340
Now goddammit! I rue the day, I became a Victor!

476
00:48:56,070 --> 00:48:58,600
And I rue the day, that I brought Bix in!

477
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:00,810
You didn't bring Bix in.

478
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:04,640
He suckered you, into introducing him to me.

479
00:49:11,630 --> 00:49:13,850
Nobody likes to be... suckered!

480
00:49:14,610 --> 00:49:16,050
Hey. 

481
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:17,970
Go easy on him!

482
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:28,470
I actually felt that one.

483
00:49:28,870 --> 00:49:30,130
Good.

484
00:49:30,190 --> 00:49:33,320
We got some serious hell-fighting 
to do with Billy Wings.

485
00:49:33,550 --> 00:49:36,000
In... or out?

486
00:49:36,170 --> 00:49:37,780
Well, I don't know, only one way.

487
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:40,570
Which way's it gonna be?

488
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:42,730
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.

489
00:49:42,810 --> 00:49:44,310
I'm in.

490
00:49:45,210 --> 00:49:46,710
Good.

491
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:49,230
I'm holding two aces.

492
00:49:49,710 --> 00:49:51,760
I'm holding two aces and one Deuce.

493
00:49:51,810 --> 00:49:55,230
I'm holding one Deuce, at the Inn 6.

494
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:57,700
Off of Route 66.

495
00:49:57,810 --> 00:49:59,690
I had it covered. 

496
00:49:59,950 --> 00:50:02,760
I had it all fucking covered.

497
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:06,980
I want you to meet me at Inn 6, Route 66

498
00:50:07,090 --> 00:50:08,750
Tomorrow morning, at 6AM.

499
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:11,910
Think you can remember that?
- Are you gonna tell me six more times?

500
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:14,810
Child of six can remember that.

501
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:02,580
Hey.

502
00:51:02,770 --> 00:51:04,800
What do those white wings mean?

503
00:51:06,270 --> 00:51:08,650
They're for licking virgin pussy.

504
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:16,190
Red wings, for licking a bleeding pussy.

505
00:51:17,030 --> 00:51:18,360
See that?

506
00:51:18,410 --> 00:51:21,480
Blue and yellow, for licking a police woman.

507
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:24,990
Blue, yellow and brown wings.

508
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:27,440
They're for licking a police woman's asshole.

509
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:29,570
Green wings...

510
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:31,330
For licking a pussy with crabs.

511
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:33,260
And purple wings..

512
00:51:34,970 --> 00:51:36,910
They're for licking a dead pussy.

513
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:42,280
See that?

514
00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:44,990
Pill-popping, cunt-eating... 

515
00:51:45,270 --> 00:51:48,070
dog-smoking motherfucker!

516
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:51,770
But you know...  In a good way.

517
00:51:55,110 --> 00:51:56,910
Get out of here.

518
00:51:57,610 --> 00:51:59,220
Come 'ere.

519
00:52:11,550 --> 00:52:13,050
Comanche. 

520
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:15,170
I want you to meet Maria.

521
00:52:16,150 --> 00:52:17,650
Hello.

522
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:23,030
What the hell are you, and what the fuck is your story?

523
00:52:23,790 --> 00:52:26,240
I'm just a guy named Comanche.

524
00:52:27,370 --> 00:52:28,870
A Victor...

525
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:32,110
Named Comanche.
That's my story.

526
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:34,680
Do you know anything about a key?

527
00:52:34,790 --> 00:52:37,180
No, tell me about it.

528
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:45,270
Do you know anything about a safe-deposit box?

529
00:52:46,810 --> 00:52:48,310
No...

530
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:50,960
Tell me about it.

531
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,410
Ever heard of Cherokee Kisum?

532
00:53:04,210 --> 00:53:07,210
I knew a Cherokee Indian woman once.

533
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:12,230
The Deuce did too, from way back.

534
00:53:13,730 --> 00:53:17,080
And they weren't busy leading the sexual revolution.

535
00:53:17,210 --> 00:53:21,410
They were busy producing acid.
They made a fortune on the LSD market.

536
00:53:21,610 --> 00:53:23,110
Then coke.

537
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,220
The only problem was...

538
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:28,560
She was fucking over the Deuce while she was fucking him.

539
00:53:28,610 --> 00:53:31,030
And let me tell you something...

540
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:34,820
She stashed away one hell of a mint.

541
00:53:35,370 --> 00:53:38,570
On July 4th, 1976

542
00:53:39,150 --> 00:53:41,290
She went up in flames.

543
00:53:42,790 --> 00:53:44,290
She had a boy.

544
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:48,570
Nobody saw that boy ever again.

545
00:53:52,590 --> 00:53:55,480
How do I know for sure that you're you?

546
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:00,260
Stand up.

547
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:19,510
Hi Deuce. How are ya?

548
00:54:21,890 --> 00:54:23,750
Hello Johnny.

549
00:54:24,710 --> 00:54:26,960
It's been, many a moon.

550
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:40,260
Ah, thank you, for this suite Johnny.

551
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:44,850
You know, uh... Hope I'm not being unreasonable, but...

552
00:54:45,170 --> 00:54:47,930
No mint on the pillow again, last night.

553
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,860
No pillow, in fact.

554
00:54:51,990 --> 00:54:53,840
You know Johnny.

555
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:55,850
Mint-whoring is...

556
00:54:56,090 --> 00:54:57,800
Not good for business.

557
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:02,290
The key to a good business relationship is,
everybody's happy.

558
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:05,420
I'm not happy, Johnny.

559
00:55:07,150 --> 00:55:08,650
That's...

560
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:10,920
That's a very nice suit.

561
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:13,500
Yeah, well, it used to be.

562
00:55:13,550 --> 00:55:15,940
Before I was Shanghaid two nights ago.

563
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:25,190
I thought you got killed by a big rig
back in '86!

564
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:26,990
 

565
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:29,370
 

566
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:31,470
I ain't happy Johnny.

567
00:55:32,550 --> 00:55:35,040
Who is, Deuce?

568
00:55:35,370 --> 00:55:36,870
I mean...

569
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:41,300
Tell me if it's none of my business, but I, I...

570
00:55:41,430 --> 00:55:43,920
I heard you did a lot of traveling all these years.

571
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:46,660
That's very true. In America.

572
00:55:46,870 --> 00:55:48,390
Building an empire.

573
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:52,800
Just right around, the summer of '76

574
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:54,500
I think, when you...

575
00:55:54,570 --> 00:55:56,070
You kind of...

576
00:55:56,460 --> 00:55:59,480
86th yourself from the Six-Six-Sixers.

577
00:56:00,130 --> 00:56:01,920
You know, Johnny.

578
00:56:02,090 --> 00:56:04,070
Motorcycles' a big business.

579
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:06,030
A -big- business. 

580
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:08,350
I mean, books, magazines, 

581
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:11,470
Clothing, customizing shops.

582
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:14,530
So big that I finally had to give up...

583
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:17,200
Riding bikes, so I could...

584
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:20,760
Concentrate on my motorcycle business.

585
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:23,820
I travelled all over the United States.

586
00:56:23,870 --> 00:56:25,640
The Keystone State...

587
00:56:25,690 --> 00:56:27,360
the Treasure State...

588
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:29,210
The Show Me State...

589
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:31,020
Setting up businesses.

590
00:56:31,890 --> 00:56:34,390
I decided to come back here, because

591
00:56:35,910 --> 00:56:38,170
Because I had some, unfinished business.

592
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:40,130
Boy, oh boy.

593
00:56:40,210 --> 00:56:42,080
I tell you.

594
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:45,380
I don't know nothing about the...

595
00:56:45,430 --> 00:56:47,850
Keystone States...

596
00:56:48,430 --> 00:56:51,170
The Treasure State or the Show Me State.

597
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:53,020
I don't know 'em...

598
00:56:53,190 --> 00:56:55,280
My business has always been

599
00:56:55,330 --> 00:56:57,340
Just kinda minding my own business.

600
00:56:57,460 --> 00:57:00,600
So how is business?

601
00:57:01,190 --> 00:57:02,470
It's business as usual.

602
00:57:02,540 --> 00:57:05,610
Good.

603
00:57:06,170 --> 00:57:07,930
Then, can we get down to business? 
Let's cut a deal.

604
00:57:08,540 --> 00:57:11,600
How's this. I get the Sixers of your back.

605
00:57:11,690 --> 00:57:14,560
And off of The Gent's back.

606
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:16,700
And uh...

607
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:20,850
You give me whatever you think I'm entitled to

608
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:23,040
For services rendered.

609
00:57:23,530 --> 00:57:25,410
And everybody's happy.

610
00:57:25,610 --> 00:57:28,960
The three key points of this deal being that...

611
00:57:30,210 --> 00:57:32,860
I get deposited back in LA 

612
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:34,810
With my entitlement

613
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:38,960
And you and The Gent, get to die old men.

614
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:42,480
Those are the three keypoints of this deal.

615
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:47,600
I've had enough of you.

616
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:52,300
Cut out the double talk.

617
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:58,880
He doesn't know anything about 
a safe-deposit box or a key.

618
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:02,250
Key...?

619
00:58:02,350 --> 00:58:03,640
What...

620
00:58:03,710 --> 00:58:06,900
What, what key are you talking about?

621
00:58:07,030 --> 00:58:10,540
The key that Cherokee Kisum had made.

622
00:58:10,990 --> 00:58:13,260
Who's Cherokee Kisum?

623
00:58:19,130 --> 00:58:21,870
Cherokee Kisum was the young woman

624
00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:24,240
You kept company with.

625
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:34,910
The young woman, who was set on fire on 
July 4th, 1976.

626
00:58:49,350 --> 00:58:51,510
Deuce, she's gotta burn.

627
00:58:57,670 --> 00:58:59,120
No, Johnny, I...

628
00:58:59,170 --> 00:59:02,920
I'm sorry, I don't have any recollection of any of this.

629
00:59:04,110 --> 00:59:06,070
It was quite a long time ago.

630
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:10,760
Can you recollect setting St. Louie on fire
a couple of nights ago?

631
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:18,440
Deuce! I swear!

632
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:20,650
Pistolero never said a fucking thing about

633
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:22,890
Any safe-deposit box!

634
00:59:22,970 --> 00:59:24,430
No Johnny.

635
00:59:24,510 --> 00:59:26,410
No memory of it at all.

636
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:28,110
But then...

637
00:59:28,230 --> 00:59:30,590
I ain't no Marcel Proust.

638
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:36,170
You got any, proof of all this?

639
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:39,910
Do I need fucking proof?

640
00:59:39,990 --> 00:59:42,050
Well, you must need something, or...

641
00:59:42,190 --> 00:59:44,250
I'd be dead already, wouldn't I?

642
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:47,210
The only reason you're not dead is,
before I kill you

643
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:50,180
I wanted to ask Sonny Kisum if he'd 
like to cut off your head

644
00:59:50,230 --> 00:59:52,200
Before I do it.

645
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:00,450
Hell yes.

646
01:00:38,770 --> 01:00:42,370
I waited all these years, to kill him with you.

647
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:49,020
We still got business with Billy Wings.

648
01:00:50,790 --> 01:00:52,780
Partners in crime, right?

649
01:01:02,510 --> 01:01:07,020
I had Eddie Zero trying to track down Sonny Kisum for years.

650
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:09,930
Maybe you would have found Sonny Kisum.

651
01:01:10,890 --> 01:01:13,530
If your tracker wasn't a 24/7 hash head.

652
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:15,220
No.

653
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:18,700
No, in my opinion, you don't find Sonny Kisum

654
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:21,320
Until Sonny Kisum wants to be found.

655
01:01:21,580 --> 01:01:23,380
I was just about to say that.

656
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:30,610
Cherokee Kisum...

657
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:35,580
Was one wild as hell woman.

658
01:01:37,930 --> 01:01:39,860
A good woman.

659
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:43,000
But wild...

660
01:01:46,350 --> 01:01:48,260
I gave her my word.

661
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:51,430
If anything happened to her

662
01:01:52,830 --> 01:01:55,930
I'd safekeep the treasure for her boy.

663
01:01:56,450 --> 01:01:58,420
Is it being kept safe for her?

664
01:02:00,390 --> 01:02:02,800
And the safekeeping of Cherokee Kisum was?

665
01:02:03,540 --> 01:02:06,460
She wasn't looking to me for safekeeping?

666
01:02:08,710 --> 01:02:10,590
I never knew what happened the day she died. 

667
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:12,930
And couldn't find anyone who did.

668
01:02:14,270 --> 01:02:16,380
It was a thirty-six carrat,

669
01:02:17,070 --> 01:02:18,910
Diamond-studded,

670
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:21,330
Solid gold riddle.

671
01:02:25,670 --> 01:02:27,170
Look, I'm an owl.

672
01:02:30,810 --> 01:02:32,310
 

673
01:02:33,940 --> 01:02:36,250
Oh man...

674
01:02:37,150 --> 01:02:38,650
Get out of here.

675
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:40,660
text 675

676
01:02:42,020 --> 01:02:43,940
In the basket.

677
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:06,010
Ain't that Pistolero one malevolent motherfucker!

678
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:08,650
Follow me to Pistolero!

679
01:03:08,890 --> 01:03:11,110
If you can stomach it.

680
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:16,950
Well now, the way I see it.

681
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:20,520
I did got close to that treasure once before.

682
01:03:21,670 --> 01:03:24,750
And I ain't gonna let that motherfucker 
fuck it up again this time.

683
01:03:29,270 --> 01:03:31,250
Let's ride!

684
01:04:55,670 --> 01:04:57,590
Go home...

685
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:00,480
It all amount to nothing!

686
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:11,830
 

687
01:05:15,730 --> 01:05:17,760
Pistolero's coming here.

688
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,470
Don't fuck up. I need him alive.

689
01:05:43,460 --> 01:05:46,100
Hey! Biker biker!

690
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:35,620
Purple wings!

691
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:41,770
Can you two stomach which dead pussy 
earned me my purple wings?

692
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:44,940
 

693
01:07:23,530 --> 01:07:25,670
Ain't nothin' you can do to me

694
01:07:25,850 --> 01:07:27,850
I can't stomach.

695
01:07:28,510 --> 01:07:30,460
You ain't seen nothing yet.

696
01:07:34,110 --> 01:07:35,570
 

697
01:07:43,870 --> 01:07:45,260
 

698
01:08:19,430 --> 01:08:20,850
 

699
01:08:38,260 --> 01:08:40,120
 

700
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:53,990
Give Comanche the two keys you're holding
and let him safekeep 'em for a while.

701
01:08:56,820 --> 01:08:59,030
Give Comanche the two keys you're holding

702
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:01,850
And let him safekeep 'em for a while, goddammit!

703
01:09:12,050 --> 01:09:14,580
Take a peak at St. Louie, 
see if he's resting in peace.

704
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:17,130
Look for the cactus flower.

705
01:09:23,590 --> 01:09:26,460
You know, you should lighten up on yourself.

706
01:09:26,970 --> 01:09:29,780
When you fuck with The Deuce, you're gonna get
burned by The Deuce!

707
01:09:29,830 --> 01:09:32,580
I met her before she met The Deuce.

708
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:37,150
First met her in 1969. 

709
01:09:37,220 --> 01:09:39,090
Through Eddie Zero.

710
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:41,950
She was sixteen, I was fourteen.

711
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:44,130
Think about that one.

712
01:10:28,050 --> 01:10:29,550
Hey.

713
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:31,710
You okay?
- Nada?

714
01:10:32,330 --> 01:10:33,830
Yes sir.

715
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:35,520
Did you bring my jacket?

716
01:10:35,570 --> 01:10:37,410
Everything okay?
- Ah yeah.

717
01:10:39,970 --> 01:10:41,470
So...

718
01:10:41,530 --> 01:10:43,120
How come we've never met before?

719
01:10:43,180 --> 01:10:45,290
I'm Eddie.
- I know Eddie.

720
01:10:45,460 --> 01:10:47,290
You ever get tired of faking your own death?

721
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:50,380
You got a joint?

722
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:52,540
Sure do.

723
01:10:54,330 --> 01:10:56,640
Baby.
- Hey Kimosabe...

724
01:10:57,080 --> 01:11:00,490
Just how much was in that box for us?
From the Cherokee woman.

725
01:11:00,950 --> 01:11:02,380
Us?

726
01:11:02,430 --> 01:11:04,560
Us, yeah. Like you and me, us, yeah.

727
01:11:04,670 --> 01:11:07,210
I know it would come to this. Us.

728
01:11:07,350 --> 01:11:10,120
Well, I don't want nothing from it. 

729
01:11:10,510 --> 01:11:13,010
I'm only curious to know how much is in there.

730
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:14,960
You're just curious...

731
01:11:15,210 --> 01:11:16,900
But you don't want nothing from it.

732
01:11:17,030 --> 01:11:19,010
No, I don't.

733
01:11:19,890 --> 01:11:22,500
It's none of our business, what's in the box.

734
01:11:22,630 --> 01:11:24,460
So, what you're saying is...

735
01:11:24,520 --> 01:11:27,090
That the booty, in the box,

736
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:31,010
That I've already said,
that I don't want nothing from.

737
01:11:31,450 --> 01:11:33,450
Is none of my business?

738
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:56,790
So let me get this straight.

739
01:11:56,840 --> 01:11:59,760
The box, and the booty that's in it...

740
01:12:00,140 --> 01:12:02,740
Which, I've already said

741
01:12:02,970 --> 01:12:05,320
That I don't want nothing off,

742
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:07,340
Is none of my business?

743
01:12:07,390 --> 01:12:09,690
Put out of the booty business, in other words.

744
01:12:09,730 --> 01:12:12,110
Well you're being downright unfriendly now.

745
01:12:12,180 --> 01:12:14,840
Where's the cash that Bob the Bum was holding

746
01:12:14,890 --> 01:12:17,160
When he got his throat slit. 

747
01:12:18,740 --> 01:12:20,780
Oh, well I'm holding on to that.

748
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:24,960
I'm keeping it safe.

749
01:12:25,330 --> 01:12:27,240
Because that's my destiny.

750
01:12:27,410 --> 01:12:29,200
And maybe that's none of your business.

751
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:32,370
Oh, I think it's my business
I think it's my business to have it right in my hand right here.

752
01:12:32,420 --> 01:12:34,810
Listen, I don't want to have to kill you.

753
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:39,030
I want you to hand over Bob the Bum's cash right now.

754
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:41,000
Go ahead,

755
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:26,590
Go ahead, where do you want to kill me? Here?

756
01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:28,760
You want to kill me between the eyes?

757
01:13:28,820 --> 01:13:31,330
Right between the eyes, yeah.

758
01:13:31,570 --> 01:13:34,030
Go ahead, go ahead, put it right between the fucking eyes.

759
01:13:34,580 --> 01:13:37,150
Come on, go ahead.

760
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:39,020
Come on.

761
01:13:45,710 --> 01:13:47,320
I was counting on you

762
01:13:47,370 --> 01:13:50,510
To do something, to stop this whole 
fucking rediculous thing.

763
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:51,950
Stop all this bullshit
- The hell made you think 

764
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,300
You could count on me? 

765
01:13:54,380 --> 01:13:56,370
What got into your fucking brain?

766
01:13:56,420 --> 01:13:58,370
Because I love ya.

767
01:14:01,390 --> 01:14:02,890
Aw hell.

768
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,010
You did good Sonny.

769
01:14:17,770 --> 01:14:21,340
I think I'm gonna call you,
Son from now on.

770
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:25,340
Cause Sonny's eating up way to much fucking time.
