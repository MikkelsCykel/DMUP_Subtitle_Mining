1
00:04:56,112 --> 00:04:59,240
This is the most amazing
I've ever seen.

2
00:04:59,982 --> 00:05:05,682
- I've been with some good schools.
- All of them! All of the best.

3
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:09,650
One right after another.

4
00:05:10,793 --> 00:05:16,322
You've also been with
the Lucky Erin Bar and Grill.

5
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:20,567
- Pittsburgh. Bartender.
- And a disc jockey.

6
00:05:20,703 --> 00:05:25,072
In Oklahoma. I used to broadcast
in sign language.

7
00:05:26,809 --> 00:05:31,075
- You've covered the map, Mr Leeds.
- I've got a lot of energy.

8
00:05:32,014 --> 00:05:37,680
I'm sure you do have energy
and new ideas. I did, too, when...

9
00:05:38,488 --> 00:05:41,514
But nobody's trying
to change the world here.

10
00:05:41,691 --> 00:05:46,993
Just trying to help a few deaf kids
get along a little better.

11
00:05:47,163 --> 00:05:49,996
Everything else is razzle-dazzle.

12
00:05:51,334 --> 00:05:54,826
Am I making myself clear?

13
00:05:55,004 --> 00:05:57,700
Yes, I believe that you are.

14
00:06:39,882 --> 00:06:42,715
Are we being punished?

15
00:06:57,099 --> 00:07:00,933
Hi! I'm James Leeds.

16
00:07:01,103 --> 00:07:08,202
My signing is rusty,
so how many of you can read lips?

17
00:07:09,946 --> 00:07:13,882
No one? OK. Class dismissed.

18
00:07:23,993 --> 00:07:26,325
No, no, no!

19
00:07:26,495 --> 00:07:32,764
Just testing. Sit down.
Lydia and Tony, good lip-readers.

20
00:07:34,604 --> 00:07:38,506
Would you mind closing your notebook?

21
00:07:39,108 --> 00:07:40,735
Thank you.

22
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:45,643
Give me one good reason
why we should learn to speak?

23
00:07:45,815 --> 00:07:49,114
- Tony.
- To pick up hearing girls.

24
00:07:49,285 --> 00:07:53,278
To pick up hearing girls.
Let's work on this.

25
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:58,089
You, you, you.

26
00:08:01,163 --> 00:08:07,159
Here are two beautiful hearing girls.
You two guys want to pick them up.

27
00:08:07,336 --> 00:08:12,171
What is the first thing you want to say?
Danny.

28
00:08:13,876 --> 00:08:19,041
- Are you rich?
- Are you ri-i-ich? Say it.

29
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:21,978
- Rich.
- Good.

30
00:08:22,151 --> 00:08:24,483
- Lydia?
- I'm very rich.

31
00:08:24,654 --> 00:08:27,179
Good! Tony?

32
00:08:29,792 --> 00:08:32,818
Let's go somewhere and do it.

33
00:08:34,497 --> 00:08:37,022
No, thank you.

34
00:08:37,566 --> 00:08:42,868
- Let's go somewhere and do it.
- I'd rather do it with her.

35
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:47,305
Cute. How about you guys?
Do you want to join us?

36
00:08:50,413 --> 00:08:54,008
- They don't talk.
- Fair enough.

37
00:08:54,183 --> 00:08:58,882
OK, reasons to talk. Right.

38
00:09:00,089 --> 00:09:04,287
If your hands are occupied.

39
00:09:04,427 --> 00:09:09,364
For example. Some guy
owes you money. He comes by.

40
00:09:09,532 --> 00:09:14,868
But you just happen to be
in a handstand.

41
00:09:15,404 --> 00:09:20,535
How will you tell him to give you
your money? You can't use your hands.

42
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:25,909
You've got to speak.
"Give me my money, you bum. "

43
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:32,812
"Don't call me names. I don't have
to take that. Do you want to fight?"

44
00:09:32,955 --> 00:09:35,822
"Put up your feet and fight like a man!"

45
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:37,357
See.

46
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:01,215
"Take your pots... "

47
00:10:01,383 --> 00:10:04,477
"... and your lousy food, and shove... "

48
00:10:12,428 --> 00:10:14,555
She doesn't mince words.

49
00:10:34,316 --> 00:10:37,774
Mr Leeds! Mr Leeds!

50
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,825
Leeds? Leeds!

51
00:10:44,527 --> 00:10:48,793
- Join us.
- Sir, OK. Sorry.

52
00:10:51,167 --> 00:10:54,295
- It's good you're out of my classroom.
- Sit down, James.

53
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:57,439
Mary Lee Ochs,
Assistant Superintendent.

54
00:10:57,606 --> 00:11:00,302
Orin Dennis, Math and Social Studies.

55
00:11:00,476 --> 00:11:03,206
James Leeds.

56
00:11:03,612 --> 00:11:09,312
Did I hear Miss Ochs say
that you were one of her students?

57
00:11:09,485 --> 00:11:12,045
- Yes. I started here at five.
- Really?

58
00:11:12,221 --> 00:11:16,988
- That's great. I'm impressed.
- For still being here?

59
00:11:17,827 --> 00:11:22,127
- No, what I meant...
- Excuse me. See you all later.

60
00:11:22,298 --> 00:11:24,061
Bye.

61
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:35,308
- Who is that?
- That's Sarah.

62
00:11:35,477 --> 00:11:40,176
Never mind her. She's a pain in the ass.
Always has been.

63
00:11:40,349 --> 00:11:43,375
- What does she do?
- She works here.

64
00:11:43,552 --> 00:11:48,546
Orin, how about the kids making
pot-holders for Mother's Day?

65
00:11:48,724 --> 00:11:53,957
But they don't sell.
We've got hundreds left from last year.

66
00:11:55,097 --> 00:11:58,464
Sarah came here at five, too.
We grew up together.

67
00:11:58,601 --> 00:12:01,536
Is she a teacher, too?

68
00:12:01,704 --> 00:12:07,574
She was one of the brightest students
we've ever had. Some water, please.

69
00:12:07,743 --> 00:12:10,234
Thank you.

70
00:12:50,586 --> 00:12:53,555
Leeds, you're a genius.

71
00:12:55,624 --> 00:12:58,320
You will work!

72
00:13:02,064 --> 00:13:05,056
Ooh, yeah.

73
00:13:08,003 --> 00:13:10,028
Mr Bach!

74
00:13:12,574 --> 00:13:15,634
Hear that, cat?

75
00:13:40,769 --> 00:13:44,296
Ba-boo-ma-rang-rang-rang.

76
00:13:44,473 --> 00:13:47,874
- Again. Faster.
- Ba-boo-ma-rang-rang-rang.

77
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:51,274
- Once more. Faster.
- Ba-boo-ma-rang-rang-rang.

78
00:13:51,447 --> 00:13:53,881
Great! Great.

79
00:13:55,484 --> 00:13:59,147
That's great. Oh, Lydia, my Lydia.

80
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:01,647
Come here, Lydia.

81
00:14:02,491 --> 00:14:05,949
Put your hands on the speaker.
Come on.

82
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:11,666
Can you feel that?

83
00:14:13,635 --> 00:14:15,227
Good.

84
00:14:15,404 --> 00:14:16,894
Feel it.

85
00:14:17,172 --> 00:14:21,802
Like a boomerang, baby
Like a boomerang-rang-rang

86
00:14:21,977 --> 00:14:25,310
Two, three, four,
ba-boo-ma-rang-rang-rang.

87
00:14:25,481 --> 00:14:28,314
- Use your voice.
- Ba-boo-ma-rang-rang-rang.

88
00:15:41,256 --> 00:15:43,190
A drip.

89
00:15:44,927 --> 00:15:47,487
Drip.

90
00:15:49,064 --> 00:15:51,897
What a drip!

91
00:16:47,289 --> 00:16:49,052
Sorry.

92
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:16,013
No, no, no!

93
00:17:16,185 --> 00:17:21,179
No, that's not what I meant.
I just wanted to introduce myself.

94
00:17:21,356 --> 00:17:24,814
I'm James Leeds. It's Sarah, isn't it?

95
00:17:24,993 --> 00:17:28,895
Would you like to sit down? Right here.

96
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:40,867
OK, we'll both stand up.

97
00:17:43,412 --> 00:17:45,607
Oh, I see.

98
00:17:47,349 --> 00:17:51,342
Very good. You got me there.
Look at me, please.

99
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,819
If you don't look at me, I can't...

100
00:17:54,957 --> 00:18:01,521
So, Doctor Franklin tells me that
you've been here since you were five.

101
00:18:07,269 --> 00:18:10,136
When did you graduate?

102
00:18:14,643 --> 00:18:18,101
And now you work here?

103
00:18:21,383 --> 00:18:24,443
Are you reading my lips?

104
00:18:26,755 --> 00:18:30,555
I don't think that you are
reading my lips.

105
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:37,354
Gee, that was quick of me, wasn't it?

106
00:18:38,767 --> 00:18:41,463
You could have told me.

107
00:18:41,637 --> 00:18:45,004
Why? How about common courtesy?

108
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:51,176
How about me leaving
so you can mop the floor?

109
00:18:54,082 --> 00:18:55,982
Man!

110
00:18:56,151 --> 00:19:02,886
If you let me, I bet
I could teach you how to speak.

111
00:19:05,527 --> 00:19:09,987
And you could teach me...
But I don't want to mop the floor.

112
00:19:10,932 --> 00:19:13,765
That was quick.

113
00:19:13,935 --> 00:19:18,338
And you don't want to speak.

114
00:19:20,709 --> 00:19:23,007
Brilliant.

115
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,539
Schmuck.

116
00:20:16,765 --> 00:20:21,725
- It's a damn shame.
- Costly, too. Re-sodding is damn costly.

117
00:20:21,903 --> 00:20:25,395
- No, I'm talking about Sarah Norman.
- Right, Sarah.

118
00:20:25,574 --> 00:20:30,602
- Look at this. What a mess!
- Has she ever tried to use her voice?

119
00:20:30,779 --> 00:20:35,045
Sarah's not hard-of-hearing.
She was born totally deaf.

120
00:20:35,217 --> 00:20:39,517
- Yeah, that makes it tough.
- The rain is lousing up the fields.

121
00:20:39,688 --> 00:20:43,522
It's a shame that a bright woman
is cleaning toilets.

122
00:20:43,692 --> 00:20:49,221
It doesn't bother her. Look, hotshot,
not everyone wants to be a star.

123
00:20:49,398 --> 00:20:53,732
Sarah is content.
She had a rotten time as a kid.

124
00:20:53,902 --> 00:20:59,204
She was diagnosed as retarded
until she was seven. We educated her.

125
00:20:59,374 --> 00:21:03,310
- For what?
- She's productive, pays taxes.

126
00:21:05,881 --> 00:21:09,817
If you want to try, I'll talk to her.

127
00:21:10,585 --> 00:21:15,887
I'll talk to her.
Look at this, will you? Damn!

128
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:21,395
- This will cost 2-3,000 dollars.
- Oh, brother!

129
00:21:23,899 --> 00:21:25,958
- Sat.
- Sat.

130
00:21:26,134 --> 00:21:28,227
All right!

131
00:21:28,804 --> 00:21:34,800
That's really good. You have to work
on the "S's", though. Go. Out.

132
00:21:40,949 --> 00:21:46,444
James? Sarah has agreed to give you
an hour, and she's looking forward to it.

133
00:21:46,621 --> 00:21:50,057
You're looking forward to it,
aren't you, Sarah?

134
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:56,496
What did I tell you?

135
00:21:56,665 --> 00:22:00,965
Well, have fun, Jim. As usual.

136
00:22:26,228 --> 00:22:28,492
Well, Sarah...

137
00:22:33,034 --> 00:22:38,472
Yeah, I do mind actually.
Fire laws and all that.

138
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,632
But you go right ahead.

139
00:22:43,845 --> 00:22:46,143
Listen...

140
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:54,055
How would you like to fake out
Franklin? Make me look real good?

141
00:22:56,558 --> 00:22:59,550
I'm sorry, I didn't get that.

142
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,640
If...

143
00:23:16,411 --> 00:23:19,244
...I don't

144
00:23:19,915 --> 00:23:22,281
sign faster,

145
00:23:22,684 --> 00:23:27,348
the hour will be over before I finish
my opening speech.

146
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:33,457
No, I'm all out of jokes.

147
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:35,892
Good.

148
00:23:37,032 --> 00:23:40,160
I'm not funny. Oh, yeah?

149
00:23:41,403 --> 00:23:47,603
If you could hear,
you'd think I was a scream.

150
00:23:48,977 --> 00:23:52,105
You're deaf. I'll try to remember that.

151
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,441
I'll forget. No, I won't.

152
00:23:57,385 --> 00:24:01,981
Listen, why don't we get
this thing started?

153
00:24:10,065 --> 00:24:12,761
Well, thank you for stopping by.

154
00:24:12,934 --> 00:24:15,835
Pleasure... was mine. God.

155
00:24:34,022 --> 00:24:37,981
- My mama.
- Your mama. Great, go.

156
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:46,323
Glen, who is your favourite person?

157
00:24:46,501 --> 00:24:52,667
- Twisted Sister? The Twisted Sister?
- It's the name of a rock group.

158
00:24:54,175 --> 00:24:57,838
Try saying that. Twisted Sister.

159
00:25:01,349 --> 00:25:04,477
Glen, it takes courage. I know.

160
00:25:06,955 --> 00:25:09,549
Just give me one sound.

161
00:25:11,026 --> 00:25:13,688
One "T".

162
00:25:16,831 --> 00:25:19,857
Try! "T".

163
00:25:31,212 --> 00:25:35,410
That's great, great. Yeah, out of here.

164
00:25:36,017 --> 00:25:39,316
Go. Great!

165
00:25:41,589 --> 00:25:43,682
Johnny?

166
00:25:44,926 --> 00:25:48,054
Who's your favourite person?

167
00:25:50,899 --> 00:25:53,390
Princess Di?

168
00:25:54,035 --> 00:25:56,094
Benji?

169
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,406
Terminator?

170
00:27:23,758 --> 00:27:25,817
Hey!

171
00:27:27,195 --> 00:27:31,131
Do you want to play
"stand up, sit down" again?

172
00:27:32,967 --> 00:27:36,130
Careful, you almost smiled.

173
00:27:37,806 --> 00:27:43,301
That's the girl! That's the Sarah Norman
we all know and love.

174
00:27:49,984 --> 00:27:53,920
If my jokes are terrible,
and my signing is boring,

175
00:27:54,055 --> 00:28:00,187
what are you doing here? There's
a whole empty beach! Unbelievable.

176
00:28:09,304 --> 00:28:12,432
I tried to call your mother.

177
00:28:13,641 --> 00:28:17,304
Hold it, hold it. Come on, wait, wait!
I can't...

178
00:28:17,879 --> 00:28:23,749
I didn't even talk to her. OK?
Can we stop this?

179
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:27,979
I mean, why can't we...

180
00:28:29,357 --> 00:28:32,485
I mean, why can't we just...

181
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:35,225
Why don't we...

182
00:28:36,865 --> 00:28:39,493
Why don't we...

183
00:28:40,235 --> 00:28:43,033
...go out and have dinner tonight?

184
00:28:46,875 --> 00:28:50,106
Just give me a "yes" or a "no".

185
00:28:59,254 --> 00:29:01,552
Yes. Good.

186
00:29:01,723 --> 00:29:04,487
I think. OK.

187
00:29:04,626 --> 00:29:10,622
I will meet you behind
the girls' dormitory, 8 o'clock.

188
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:14,796
I will whisper your name.

189
00:29:17,739 --> 00:29:21,038
Hey! I know that sign.

190
00:29:21,209 --> 00:29:24,303
That's the first sign I ever learned!

191
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:37,423
It's in Italian. Can I suggest something?

192
00:29:41,396 --> 00:29:47,665
Will you give me a break?
My Italian is worse than my signing.

193
00:29:48,336 --> 00:29:51,169
The Veal Piccata is very good.

194
00:29:53,308 --> 00:29:59,975
Look. I'm sorry.
V- E-A-L P-I-C-C-A-T-A.

195
00:30:00,148 --> 00:30:05,051
You see, by the time I finish,
they may be out of it.

196
00:30:07,288 --> 00:30:12,282
It's veal. It's saut¨¦ed
in lemon and butter.

197
00:30:15,196 --> 00:30:17,289
What's veal?

198
00:30:18,433 --> 00:30:21,334
God. What the hell is veal?

199
00:30:22,337 --> 00:30:24,134
Good evening.

200
00:30:24,305 --> 00:30:27,365
Something to drink this evening?

201
00:30:28,776 --> 00:30:31,870
Do you want something to drink?

202
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:36,175
- Our house wine is very nice.
- Wine?

203
00:30:37,385 --> 00:30:40,320
Yeah, it's OK. White wine.

204
00:30:40,788 --> 00:30:43,484
I'll take a carafe, please.

205
00:30:47,195 --> 00:30:52,394
He doesn't think you're stupid.
He thinks you're deaf.

206
00:30:54,202 --> 00:31:01,836
No, only stupid hearing people
think that deaf people are stupid.

207
00:31:10,518 --> 00:31:14,477
Do you really like being
a cleaning woman?

208
00:31:15,556 --> 00:31:17,353
Why?

209
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:26,022
Yeah, but there are other jobs where
people can work alone in silence.

210
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:32,731
Not with toilet bowl cleaner.

211
00:31:32,907 --> 00:31:39,176
You should have told me that was
the attraction. You're smart as hell!

212
00:31:41,516 --> 00:31:44,007
You want to dance?

213
00:31:45,686 --> 00:31:47,745
Can you feel it?

214
00:31:47,922 --> 00:31:51,380
Vibrations through your nose!

215
00:31:57,432 --> 00:32:01,163
I'm not good at this.
And you are. Great.

216
00:34:37,959 --> 00:34:43,420
I don't know why I became
a speech teacher. OK? Let's dance.

217
00:34:45,733 --> 00:34:48,861
It's too hard to dance and talk.

218
00:34:51,072 --> 00:34:55,236
Well, maybe I like to hear myself talk.

219
00:35:05,653 --> 00:35:12,786
I am a really good teacher.
You should let me help you.

220
00:35:16,297 --> 00:35:18,595
What is that?

221
00:35:18,766 --> 00:35:22,395
Lydia does not talk like that.

222
00:35:23,604 --> 00:35:26,767
Don't you want to get along
in the world?

223
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:32,506
No one wants my help.
That's your opinion.

224
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:36,179
Fine.

225
00:35:38,419 --> 00:35:41,911
You don't do anything you can't do well.

226
00:36:14,689 --> 00:36:18,853
Well, I would like to walk with you. It's...

227
00:36:37,144 --> 00:36:39,510
My pleasure.

228
00:37:15,116 --> 00:37:19,018
Mrs Norman? I'm James Leeds.
I didn't call again, because...

229
00:37:19,186 --> 00:37:23,987
- ... I would have hung up again.
- It's 60 miles here and back.

230
00:37:24,125 --> 00:37:28,186
- Please, just five minutes.
- I just got home from work.

231
00:37:28,362 --> 00:37:31,798
This is my time to relax.
Discussing Sarah is hardly relaxing.

232
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:33,591
Five minutes.

233
00:37:51,786 --> 00:37:53,720
Well?

234
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:59,892
Well, you haven't seen Sarah
in eight years?

235
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:03,154
Sarah doesn't want to see me.

236
00:38:03,964 --> 00:38:08,924
- Has she said why?
- We don't communicate very well.

237
00:38:09,103 --> 00:38:12,470
Did you ever learn to sign?
Some of the parents...

238
00:38:13,641 --> 00:38:18,840
I'm sick of you people coming every
two years, asking the same questions.

239
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:21,606
- Blaming me.
- No one's blaming you.

240
00:38:21,782 --> 00:38:26,845
Of course they are. They can't blame
themselves, so it's my fault. Fine.

241
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:29,955
I don't give a damn any more.

242
00:38:32,092 --> 00:38:37,428
I came to ask you one question. What
happened when Sarah tried to speak?

243
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:44,103
What happened? She looked awful.
She sounded awful.

244
00:38:45,272 --> 00:38:49,868
- People made fun of her.
- Who made fun of her?

245
00:38:53,447 --> 00:38:56,780
Other kids. Her sister's friends.

246
00:39:02,389 --> 00:39:05,825
Then she stopped trying to talk.

247
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:09,494
She's very pretty, you know.

248
00:39:09,663 --> 00:39:13,599
Her sister Ruth
had boys hanging around,

249
00:39:13,734 --> 00:39:18,967
and they started asking Sarah out
when she came home on weekends.

250
00:39:20,174 --> 00:39:23,200
It was wonderful for her.

251
00:39:24,678 --> 00:39:26,737
Boys really liked her.

252
00:39:27,815 --> 00:39:33,481
They treated her just like
they treated Ruth. With respect.

253
00:39:33,654 --> 00:39:39,183
If you didn't know there was a problem,
you'd have thought she was normal.

254
00:39:52,573 --> 00:39:54,541
Hi!

255
00:39:54,708 --> 00:39:57,677
It's true, I'm early today.

256
00:39:57,845 --> 00:40:01,872
No, don't go.
I wanted to talk to you anyway.

257
00:40:02,049 --> 00:40:08,249
No, I want to work with you.
I understand that you're scared.

258
00:40:11,759 --> 00:40:14,421
I understand nothing.

259
00:40:15,596 --> 00:40:18,861
Sarah, come back here. Sarah...

260
00:40:19,033 --> 00:40:22,469
Yelling at the back of a deaf person.
Very good.

261
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:25,434
He's been to all the best schools.

262
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:43,248
Why did you stop going home?

263
00:40:44,959 --> 00:40:50,591
Did your sister's friends,
those boys you were going out with,

264
00:40:50,764 --> 00:40:54,063
have anything to do with it?

265
00:40:57,438 --> 00:41:00,202
Yes, I talked to your mother.

266
00:41:00,341 --> 00:41:03,799
Please let me help you, damn it!

267
00:41:04,411 --> 00:41:08,575
How? By showing you the joys of sex
with a hearing man.

268
00:41:08,749 --> 00:41:13,413
I think that that is one language
that you don't speak!

269
00:41:15,623 --> 00:41:19,115
Yeah, I'm so... Come on, I can take it.

270
00:41:21,662 --> 00:41:26,861
You have enough communication skills.
I don't. They never did?

271
00:41:27,034 --> 00:41:30,868
Hey! Who is "they"?

272
00:41:33,173 --> 00:41:35,334
Hearing boys.

273
00:41:36,944 --> 00:41:41,881
They wouldn't try to learn my language.
I was expected to learn to speak.

274
00:41:42,449 --> 00:41:45,179
Well, I don't speak.

275
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:50,781
Sex was something I could do
as well as hearing girls. Better.

276
00:42:11,879 --> 00:42:17,545
At first, I let them have me
because they wanted to.

277
00:42:22,089 --> 00:42:24,421
Before long...

278
00:42:25,693 --> 00:42:31,029
...the boys were lined up
on a waiting list my sister kept for me.

279
00:42:39,406 --> 00:42:42,170
No introduction, no talk.

280
00:42:45,379 --> 00:42:49,406
We just went to a dark place and...

281
00:43:09,937 --> 00:43:13,771
They didn't even take me out
for a Coke first.

282
00:43:21,915 --> 00:43:25,544
No, that is not what I wanted
to know about you.

283
00:43:26,987 --> 00:43:32,892
I thought I was such a big deal, coming
on to the deaf girl, giving her a thrill. No!

284
00:43:34,261 --> 00:43:37,719
And all the time you were
laughing at me.

285
00:43:37,998 --> 00:43:43,231
I was thinking, "Poor little deaf virgin,
who'll spread her legs for every... "

286
00:43:44,071 --> 00:43:46,869
Do you think I'm threatened by that?

287
00:43:47,007 --> 00:43:52,240
Do you think I give a goddamn that you
fucked every pimply-faced teenager?

288
00:43:52,412 --> 00:43:55,006
I don't. I don't give a shit!

289
00:45:17,865 --> 00:45:20,698
Sarah, please listen to me.

290
00:45:21,602 --> 00:45:24,730
I'm not going away.

291
00:45:25,739 --> 00:45:30,540
I did the wrong thing. I'm sorry.

292
00:45:32,179 --> 00:45:35,239
I don't know what to say.

293
00:45:35,749 --> 00:45:38,479
Tell me what to say.

294
00:45:43,123 --> 00:45:44,988
Sarah...

295
00:45:45,125 --> 00:45:53,396
...you are the most mysterious,
beautiful, angry person I have ever met.

296
00:45:57,037 --> 00:45:59,699
I'm falling in lo...

297
00:46:06,113 --> 00:46:07,774
Sarah?

298
00:46:08,282 --> 00:46:12,013
Sarah, I am falling

299
00:46:12,152 --> 00:46:14,143
into the pool with you!

300
00:46:23,330 --> 00:46:26,458
God, what a fellow has to go through.

301
00:48:17,744 --> 00:48:20,338
- How are things going?
- Great.

302
00:48:20,514 --> 00:48:23,278
Good! Glad to hear it.

303
00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:26,886
- We must have you over soon.
- I'd like that.

304
00:48:27,054 --> 00:48:32,253
- I warn you, I'm a keen poker player.
- So I've heard.

305
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:37,062
- Are you a card player?
- Not really.

306
00:48:37,230 --> 00:48:39,790
Tic-tac-toe is my game.

307
00:48:40,467 --> 00:48:42,765
So much the better?

308
00:48:44,938 --> 00:48:50,171
Well, thanks for coming in, Jim. We
really are happy to have you with us.

309
00:48:50,911 --> 00:48:53,436
Thank you.

310
00:49:03,390 --> 00:49:06,325
- Your size?
- Yeah.

311
00:49:07,794 --> 00:49:11,230
- Be careful, Jimbo.
- Right.

312
00:49:13,467 --> 00:49:15,594
Don't fight it.

313
00:49:16,770 --> 00:49:18,829
Relax.

314
00:49:37,457 --> 00:49:40,858
Daphne, you're leading again.

315
00:50:02,749 --> 00:50:06,446
I've got a funny sensation in my toes.

316
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:10,784
Like someone was barbecuing them
over a slow flame.

317
00:50:11,324 --> 00:50:15,192
Let's put another log on that fire.

318
00:51:06,179 --> 00:51:10,946
You are the nicest person

319
00:51:11,117 --> 00:51:13,847
I've ever met.

320
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:16,614
Who, me?

321
00:51:17,457 --> 00:51:23,692
I'm the nicest person you ever met?
That's the craziest thing I ever heard.

322
00:51:30,070 --> 00:51:35,372
You thought that after what you told me,
that you'd never see me again.

323
00:51:40,847 --> 00:51:42,906
Here I am.

324
00:51:50,290 --> 00:51:54,954
Yeah, I was in love,
but she broke my heart.

325
00:51:59,933 --> 00:52:02,925
God, no! Please don't break my heart.

326
00:52:08,108 --> 00:52:11,441
Did anyone ever break yours?

327
00:52:15,115 --> 00:52:20,610
You never hurt from other people?
That's not true.

328
00:52:21,254 --> 00:52:26,191
Sarah, I know people have hurt you.
I know.

329
00:52:35,468 --> 00:52:40,167
Suppose you admitted that you hurt.

330
00:52:44,311 --> 00:52:48,907
I'd shrivel up and...

331
00:53:05,298 --> 00:53:09,735
I'll take care of you, Sarah.
I'll take care of you.

332
00:53:26,186 --> 00:53:31,021
What do you mean that was my foul?
You moved into me.

333
00:53:31,191 --> 00:53:34,524
You want to call me an asshole? Say it!

334
00:53:34,694 --> 00:53:37,822
Say it out loud. Watch my lips. Asshole.

335
00:53:37,997 --> 00:53:40,090
- Ahole.
- Asshole.

336
00:53:40,266 --> 00:53:41,824
- Asshole.
- Great!

337
00:53:42,001 --> 00:53:45,095
- Asshole!
- Good. It was still your foul.

338
00:53:45,271 --> 00:53:47,102
Asshole!

339
00:54:14,267 --> 00:54:19,534
Did you know that waves
strike the average beach

340
00:54:19,706 --> 00:54:24,905
about 750,000 times a day?

341
00:54:29,916 --> 00:54:32,009
That's true.

342
00:54:32,152 --> 00:54:34,620
I just made it up.

343
00:54:48,134 --> 00:54:50,227
You do?

344
00:54:51,304 --> 00:54:54,137
What do waves sound like?

345
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:23,500
That is what they sound like.

346
00:55:27,273 --> 00:55:33,178
How did you get to be
so brilliant and beautiful?

347
00:55:37,116 --> 00:55:41,109
And pig-headed?
You're the most stubborn person.

348
00:55:41,721 --> 00:55:43,814
You.

349
00:55:44,390 --> 00:55:47,359
You're not stubborn? OK.

350
00:55:48,194 --> 00:55:50,287
Hi, beautiful.

351
00:55:50,463 --> 00:55:53,296
What am I saying?

352
00:55:58,805 --> 00:56:01,171
Wait.

353
00:56:01,641 --> 00:56:03,802
That was a joke.

354
00:56:04,143 --> 00:56:09,137
It wasn't funny.
OK, I won't do it again.

355
00:56:10,049 --> 00:56:11,641
I promise.

356
00:56:18,324 --> 00:56:20,383
Sarah...

357
00:56:22,529 --> 00:56:24,622
I promise.

358
00:56:51,591 --> 00:56:54,253
Mr Harrison! How are you?

359
00:56:54,427 --> 00:56:57,555
Couldn't be better, Curtis.
She's doing wonderfully.

360
00:56:57,730 --> 00:57:00,858
Jim Harrison.
He donated the chemistry lab.

361
00:57:01,034 --> 00:57:06,028
- Glen is really coming along. A fine lad.
- Get him to change that idiotic hair cut?

362
00:57:06,205 --> 00:57:08,935
No, I like to give the kids leeway.

363
00:57:09,108 --> 00:57:14,068
- Asshole! Shit-for-brains!
- Look at those shingles.

364
00:57:14,247 --> 00:57:16,977
They'll have to be replaced.

365
00:57:35,902 --> 00:57:41,807
Thank you, Mr Jones' class, for your
demonstration of the four food groups.

366
00:57:43,309 --> 00:57:49,578
And now, Mr Leeds' 11th-grade speech
and language class has a treat for us.
