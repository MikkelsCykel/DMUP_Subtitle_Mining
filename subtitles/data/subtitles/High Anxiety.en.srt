1
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:42,250
The captain has turned on
the No Smoking sign.

2
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:44,400
Please extinguish all smoking materials.

3
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:46,840
Make sure your seats are
in the upright position...

4
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:51,250
...and your seatbelts fastened
in preparation for our arrival in LA.

5
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,480
Okay. Bye-bye, now.

6
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:37,170
Thank you.

7
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:40,120
Take care. Watch your step, there.

8
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,480
Goodbye.

9
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:07,960
No!

10
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:12,320
Harry! I'm so glad to see you!

11
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:28,720
Sir?

12
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:31,400
Just a moment, please.
Yes?

13
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:33,130
Just come with me, please.

14
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:36,280
- What is this about?
- I'll explain in due time. Just follow me.

15
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:41,080
- You've obviously made a mistake.
- We can clear this up if you'll follow me.

16
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:47,240
I hope there's an explanation for all this.

17
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:49,640
I'm in the dark.
There's no reason why you should...

18
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,530
This way, sir, please.

19
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:53,210
In the toilet?

20
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:59,800
I demand an explanation.
How about this?

21
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:03,730
- Oh, my God!
- Do you find me attractive?

22
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:07,450
- You're not a cop!
- They wouldn't take me!

23
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:09,920
Excuse me. I have to run now.

24
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,970
Why? Don't run away
from your feelings! Wait!

25
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:16,880
Where are you going?
Don't be so gauche. We're all doing it!

26
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:29,960
What a dramatic airport!

27
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:38,760
Dr. Thorndyke?
Dr. Richard H. Thorndyke? Hold it!

28
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,280
Who are you?

29
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:57,280
I'm Brophy. I work at the Institute.
I came to pick you up.

30
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:00,880
- I'm going to be your driver and sidekick.
- How do you do?

31
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:03,800
Why the picture-taking?

32
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:06,240
I love to take pictures.
I'm very photogenic.

33
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:08,760
I even develop them myself.
I have my own darkroom.

34
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:11,570
Please hold the camera, Doc.
I'll get the trunk.

35
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:12,920
Fabulous.

36
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:17,840
I got it. I got it...

37
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:21,080
I ain't got it!

38
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:22,760
I'll get it.

39
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,200
I got it...

40
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:26,960
I ain't got it.

41
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:29,160
I got it...

42
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:32,040
I ain't got it.

43
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:36,450
- Where's the car?
- Over there.

44
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:39,490
- Would you mind opening the trunk?
- I'll open the trunk.

45
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:41,560
I'll save us a little time.

46
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:44,920
You got it. You got it...

47
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:47,490
There we go.

48
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:54,840
Doc, I sure am glad you're
taking over as the new head of the asylum.

49
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:57,490
We haven't had a real chief
since Dr. Ashley died.

50
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:00,040
I just hope I do as good a job
as Ashley did.

51
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:04,250
- He was a brilliant psychiatric innovator.
- Yeah, innovator.

52
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:08,530
When it was announced that you would
take over, Dr. Montague blew his top.

53
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:10,520
Between me, you and the steering wheel...

54
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:14,440
...I guess Montague figured he had the job
tucked away in his back pocket.

55
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:16,200
If you get my drift.

56
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:17,280
Is that so?

57
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:19,680
And then, from out of the blue...

58
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:23,690
...they go and get you, a professor
from Harvard University. No offense.

59
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:25,170
None taken.

60
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:28,560
Boy, I tell you, it was a real shock
to everybody when Ashley died.

61
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:30,920
The guy was in tiptop shape!

62
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:33,970
One can never predict a heart attack.

63
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:37,330
Heart attack? Don't make me laugh.

64
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,840
Brophy, what are you saying?

65
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:43,640
If you ask me,
I think Dr. Ashley was the victim of...

66
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,690
...foul play.

67
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:12,840
Foul play? Brophy, your imagination
is getting the best of you.

68
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:16,280
Let's not forget that you are working
in a psychiatric institution...

69
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,560
...which is conducive to fantasy.

70
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:21,080
Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm wrong.

71
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:24,490
I know I'm right.

72
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,840
Brophy here with the new head shrink.

73
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,640
Well, Doc, here's your new home.

74
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:20,360
Dr. Thorndyke, I am simply
delighted to meet you in person.

75
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:23,330
I've read everything you've ever written
on psychiatry.

76
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:25,400
Your lectures, your monographs,
your books.

77
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:28,370
I'm absolutely thrilled
that you're taking over the Institute.

78
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:29,800
Thank you...

79
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:32,770
- Wentworth, Dr. Philip Wentworth.
- A pleasure.

80
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:34,960
I've been with the Institute for two years.

81
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:39,250
I just know that things are going to change
for the better now that you're here.

82
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:42,080
You see, ever since Dr. Ashley died...

83
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:44,000
...strange things have been happening here.

84
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:45,410
Wentworth!

85
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:50,680
The eminent Dr. Thorndyke.

86
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:53,970
It's a great day here at the Institute
for the Very, Very Nervous.

87
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:57,800
May I say that we have been looking
forward with anticipation to your arrival.

88
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:00,770
Allow me to introduce myself.
I am Dr. Charles Montague.

89
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:01,880
I was in charge till now.

90
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:09,640
Allow me to introduce Nurse Diesel,
my right-hand man. Woman.

91
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:13,360
Dr. Thorndyke. How do you do?
Charlotte Diesel.

92
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:17,000
I left a complete medical file of everyone
in the Institute in your room.

93
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:20,290
I'm sure you'll want to rest
before you meet the rest of the staff.

94
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,960
Dinner is served at 8:00
in the private dining room.

95
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:26,280
Those who are tardy do not get fruit cup.
Excuse me.

96
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:30,720
Dr. Thorndyke, may I say...

97
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:32,130
Charles.
Bye.

98
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:37,000
Do you see what I mean?
I'm trying to tell you...

99
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:38,840
Wentworth!
Goodbye.

100
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,970
I got it. I got it...

101
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:48,290
I ain't got it.

102
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:03,800
Come in.

103
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:06,680
Thorndyke. My Richard!

104
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,000
Professor Little-old-man!

105
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:13,920
Lilloman. Lilloman. Nobody gets it right.

106
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:15,650
Little-old-man, Little-old-man...

107
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:16,920
Richard!

108
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:23,600
My best pupil.
My best student which I ever had.

109
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:27,680
A patient comes to you.
He is suffering from Belden's Hysteria.

110
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,730
He has a seizure right in your office.
What do you give him?

111
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:34,360
Two cc's of aqueous Thorazine
coupled with one cc of Somadiazine.

112
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:37,720
Good. And the most important thing?

113
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,200
Never take a personal check.

114
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:43,930
That's my boy. That's my good pupil.

115
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:47,490
Professor, it's so good to see you.
Please, sit down. Let's talk.

116
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:48,560
To sit? Ja.

117
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:53,280
Richard, I am so proud of you.
So proud, my boy.

118
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:57,120
Head of your class at Johns Hopkins.

119
00:11:57,210 --> 00:12:00,440
Associate professor at Dartmouth.
Full professor at Harvard.

120
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:03,040
Winner of the Nobel Prize. And now...

121
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:07,880
...the head of the most prestigious
psychiatric institute on the West Coast.

122
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:13,600
I'm sorry, excuse me.
When you get old, you get very emotional.

123
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:17,320
Oops. I blew too fast.

124
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:21,650
- Here, Professor, some tissues.
- Danke schön to you.

125
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,320
- Professor?
- Ja?

126
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:26,480
- I had no idea you were working here.
- Working?

127
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:32,170
Working is a big word. I'm a consultant.

128
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:39,440
It's a fancy title for a part-time job.
I come in two hours a day.

129
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:42,370
I don't bother them. They don't bother me.

130
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:48,560
Your predecessor, Dr. Ashley, hired me.

131
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:53,360
It is a shame he died so all of a sudden.

132
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:57,840
He was going to make
some very big changes around here...

133
00:12:57,930 --> 00:12:59,410
...and then...

134
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:08,040
Did you see your view outside?
Oh, it is spectacular.

135
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:14,320
I've been meaning to, but I've been
so busy unpacking I haven't had a chance.

136
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:15,960
Unpack another time.

137
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:19,010
Come, Richard, I insist.
You come and see right now!

138
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:21,240
If you insist.

139
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:26,440
Come, Richard, this will be
a treat for you. Come, Ja.

140
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,640
Is this not the perfect time
of the day? Look!

141
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,760
- Very nice.
- Come over here. Here you can see better.

142
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:35,730
- Come.
- lt's beautiful.

143
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:39,040
Come here to the edge
and you can look down. Look down!

144
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:51,240
Richard!

145
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:55,200
My boy, are you all right?

146
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:58,760
Come back inside, my goodness!

147
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:01,970
Come over here, sitzen Sie. Goodness me.

148
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:06,000
Thank you, Professor. I'm sorry.
I don't know what came over me.

149
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:10,560
I know what came over you.
High Anxiety, you've still got it.

150
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:16,400
It's probably the excitement and tension
of taking over this new post. I'm...

151
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,320
...sure it will pass.

152
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:20,720
Bullshit!

153
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:27,200
These things do not let go.
High Anxiety can be a dangerous enemy.

154
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:31,560
If left unchecked,
it could cost you your life.

155
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:36,800
Tomorrow...

156
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:40,560
First thing tomorrow, we have
our first session of psychoanalysis.

157
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:44,240
My boy, I have not had you on the couch
for a long time.

158
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:47,840
My boy, I promise, we will beat this thing.

159
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:49,690
Goodbye.

160
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:52,730
But, Professor, it is really nece...

161
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:56,720
It is "nece." I know what is "nece."
Don't tell me what is "nece."

162
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:59,120
I tell you what is "nece."

163
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:45,360
Yes, as I was saying,
it came to my attention that...

164
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:48,720
...just before Dr. Ashley's untimely death...

165
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:52,640
...he was planning to make some
very big changes here at the Institute.

166
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:56,280
Do any of you know specifically
what those changes might be?

167
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:59,160
Well, for one thing he wanted to change...

168
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,650
The drapes.

169
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:03,560
The drapes?

170
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:05,080
The drapes.

171
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:10,200
He wanted to change the drapes
in the psychotic game room.

172
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:18,000
That was the extent of the big change?
The drapes?

173
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:22,560
Yes, Dr. Ashley felt that color...

174
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:27,610
...has a lot to do with the well-being
of the emotionally disturbed.

175
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:36,090
To some extent that is true, I imagine.

176
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:09,840
Only 30 seconds late.
You're so strict.

177
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:29,840
Gentlemen...

178
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:33,290
...and Nurse Diesel...

179
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:36,650
...may I propose a toast?
To our new leader:

180
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:39,280
Dr. Richard H. Thorndyke.

181
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:41,320
Long may he reign.

182
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,680
I thank you.

183
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:58,400
Yes, that's an excellent brandy.

184
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:01,410
You can tell by just sniffing the aroma.

185
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:05,450
It's much better
than the brandy we used to have.

186
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:08,320
Dr. Montague, I'm curious.

187
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:12,450
What exactly is the rate of patient recovery
here at the Institute?

188
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:16,400
Rate of patient recovery?
I'll have that for you in a moment.

189
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:24,250
Once in a blue moon.

190
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:28,080
Once in a blue moon.

191
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:31,320
Dr. Thorndyke.

192
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,890
Unfortunately...

193
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,810
...the rate of recovery in the classroom...

194
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:40,600
...is much higher than it is in real life.

195
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:45,610
We're dealing with sick people here,
you understand.

196
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:48,840
Dangerously sick people!

197
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:01,000
Dr. Thorndyke?

198
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:06,280
Will you be at the Annual Psychiatric
Convention in San Francisco next week?

199
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:09,090
Yes, I...

200
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:14,520
I think someone should attend, don't you?
I'd be delighted to have the honor.

201
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:17,680
I'm sure you'll have a nice time.

202
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:19,640
Thank you.

203
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:23,880
Up and down.

204
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:27,000
Side, side.

205
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:28,800
In and out.

206
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:31,040
Side, side.

207
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:32,200
Up and down.

208
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:34,290
Side, side.

209
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:35,930
In and out.

210
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:37,360
Side, side.

211
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:50,160
Oh, my God!

212
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,680
"Welcome! The violent ward."

213
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:05,520
Doc! Is everything all right?

214
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:08,640
Somebody just threw
an enormous rock through my window.

215
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:09,920
Jeez!

216
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:16,210
A guy like that should be put away.
Look at the size of this thing!

217
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:19,160
Here, let me get rid of it for you. I got it!

218
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:21,200
I got it!

219
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:24,600
Brophy, get it tomorrow.

220
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:25,800
Yeah.

221
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:31,520
- What was that?
- I don't know.

222
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:33,040
Come on!

223
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:41,170
It's coming from Nurse Diesel's room.

224
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:47,360
Is everything all right in there?
Nurse Diesel! Are you all right?

225
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:51,440
Yes?

226
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:55,240
We heard some weird noises emanating
from your room. We were worried.

227
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:58,720
Weird noises? It was the TV.

228
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:02,520
Sorry it disturbed you. I've turned it down.

229
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:05,610
Is there anything else? It is rather late.

230
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:08,920
No, we were concerned. Good night.

231
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:11,440
- Good night.
- Good night.

232
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:18,000
- TV? Well, you could have fooled me.
- Yeah, the TV.

233
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:20,160
It was probably the TV.

234
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,640
- Good night.
- That was no TV.

235
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:45,360
- Who was it?
- lt was Thorndyke.

236
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:49,530
- You're making too much noise.
- I can't help it, you're hurting me.

237
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:52,120
- You're going too hard tonight.
- Get off it.

238
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:55,170
I know you better than you know yourself.

239
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:58,120
You live for bondage and discipline.

240
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:02,760
Too much bondage. Not enough discipline!

241
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:06,050
You want discipline?
I'll give you discipline.

242
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:09,600
Yes!

243
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:11,280
Yes. I'm sorry!

244
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:13,440
Yes! It feels so good!

245
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:37,200
Yes?

246
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:41,240
Dr. Thorndyke,
Dr. Montague is here to see you.

247
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:45,400
Please take your hand away
from your nose and say that again.

248
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:49,610
Dr. Montague is here.
Thank you. Send him in.

249
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:58,360
Thank you for coming.
I'm sorry I'm late.

250
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:01,250
It took longer than anticipated
for my rounds this morning.

251
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:03,520
Please have a seat.
Thanks.

252
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:10,480
I'm a little disturbed.
Yes, Dr. Thorndyke?

253
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:13,560
I've studied some of these case histories
and once in a while...

254
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:17,760
...I come across a patient who behaves
in a rational and normal manner.

255
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:20,640
Zachary Cartwright IIl, for instance.

256
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:24,810
It seems his family is paying
$12,000 a month to the Institute.

257
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:28,560
According to this file
he should have been released months ago.

258
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:29,840
Well...

259
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:33,520
These case histories are really so sketchy.

260
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:36,960
They hardly draw a true picture
of the patient's psychosis.

261
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:38,800
Cartwright is a perfect example.

262
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:41,970
One moment he can be
perfectly rational and lucid...

263
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:45,170
...the next he's a living loony tune.

264
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:50,520
Do you mind if we examine him together?
He is just outside my door.

265
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:55,170
Mind? Why should I mind?
After all, you're in charge here.

266
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:57,840
You can examine anyone you want.

267
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:02,200
Please send Mr. Cartwright in. Thank you.

268
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:09,520
Mr. Cartwright, have a seat.
You know Dr. Montague, don't you?

269
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:12,770
- Hello, Dr. Montague.
- Hello, Zack.

270
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:23,000
Tell me, do you know
why you're here at the Institute?

271
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:27,880
Yes, I was brought in two years ago.
I was suffering from nervous exhaustion.

272
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:32,560
I used to get sharp pains in my neck
and dreamt about werewolves.

273
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:36,760
- Werewolves?
- Werewolves.

274
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:43,360
And in the two years you've been here,
do you feel you've made any progress?

275
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:46,280
I never get those pains anymore...

276
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:50,240
...and it's been 6 months
since I had a dream about a werewolf.

277
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:53,530
6 months since you had
your last dream about a werewolf.

278
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:59,210
Tell me frankly. If you were
returned to the community today...

279
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:03,680
...could you function in a happy,
healthy, normal and productive manner?

280
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:05,920
I think so. I feel pretty good.

281
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:10,290
- What's the matter?
- That pain just came back.

282
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:13,760
See how unpredictable he is?
Help him to the couch.

283
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:18,000
Sit right here. Put your head back.
Breathe deeply. Try to relax.

284
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:20,040
Easy.
I'll try.

285
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:23,090
This pain that you haven't experienced
in such a long time...

286
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:25,560
...has suddenly reappeared for no reason?

287
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:29,800
- I don't know what it is.
- This is such a strange experience.

288
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:32,360
- The pain is going away.
- Good. Breathe deeply.

289
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:33,480
I feel perfectly fine.

290
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:36,120
What is it?

291
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:40,120
- Cartwright, is it that same pain?
- Yes!

292
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:42,650
- Let me examine you.
- No!

293
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:45,440
I just want to help you!

294
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:49,600
- I don't understand.
- I don't understand it, either.

295
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:51,520
Relax, take it easy.

296
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:58,970
Take it easy!
Go away!

297
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:02,920
- Montague, what are we going to do?
- I don't know! Take it easy, Zack.

298
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:13,000
Cartwright!

299
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:14,810
His feet.
Got him.

300
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:20,970
Take him back to his room.
Give him a sedative.

301
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:24,160
Make it a big one.

302
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:29,200
Sad. I've never seen anything
quite like that.

303
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:33,320
- And he was doing so well.
- I know.

304
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:37,000
- lt is sad, tears your heart apart.
- Yes.

305
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:39,840
- There's that flashing again.
- Flashing?

306
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:44,360
It started this morning and here it is again.
It seems to be coming from somewhere...

307
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:47,720
- ...up there.
- Yes, the North Wing.

308
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:50,200
Room 35, I'd say.

309
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:54,640
It stopped. Who's in that room?

310
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:58,050
A patient named Brisbane.
Brisbane.

311
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:03,010
- Arthur Brisbane? The industrialist?
- Yes, I think that's the one.

312
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:06,640
- How long has he been here?
- About 18 months.

313
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:10,000
18 months?
I didn't come across his name in the files.

314
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:12,360
It must be an oversight.

315
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:15,090
I'd like to meet him.

316
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:17,970
But he's hopeless.
You don't want to meet him.

317
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:20,680
I'd like to meet him right after lunch.

318
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:24,600
All right. As you wish.

319
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:28,360
- I'll arrange it for you.
- Thank you.

320
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:33,130
Nurse Diesel? Dr. Montague here.

321
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:37,320
Dr. Thorndyke would like to meet
Arthur Brisbane right after lunch.

322
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:39,440
Good.

323
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:42,840
Ou-yay ow-knay at-whay o-tay o-day.

324
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:45,170
Et it-gay?

325
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:49,600
Everything will be taken care of.

326
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,960
There it goes again.

327
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:05,960
Falling.

328
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:08,240
Mamma! Falling!

329
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:12,480
Fight it, Thorndyke. Fight it.
You must fight it, do you hear me?

330
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:14,130
Fight your fears.

331
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:18,720
The only way to overcome High Anxiety
is to fight it.

332
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:20,770
- Fight!
- Fight!

333
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:23,690
Fight it.
Ja, fight it!

334
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:25,120
- Fight.
- Good.

335
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:27,480
Good. Fight it.

336
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:31,810
Good, fight it.
Ja, good, that's the way to fight it!

337
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:33,880
Fight it, ja. Good.

338
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:43,920
That's all right.
Get out that hostility. Good.

339
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:45,440
Fight.

340
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:52,880
You want to fight? All right.
Fight if you want. Fight.

341
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:57,170
I'll give you a fight you don't forget.
Come on, show me your stuff.

342
00:28:57,250 --> 00:28:59,760
Show me your good stuff.
All right, I'll give you...

343
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:07,400
Come on, get up, you little punk!
Stand up and fight! Come on...

344
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:14,240
Professor! What are
you doing? This is unseemly behavior.

345
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:16,440
What are you doing? Stop!

346
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:30,480
Come on, boys. We came
to see a fight, not a dance. Let's go.

347
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:38,600
Professor, what happened here?

348
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:43,640
I put him under hypnosis.
He will be out very soon.

349
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:47,600
You see, we have been running
a series of analytic sessions...

350
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:50,850
...to try to help him overcome
the very serious illness...

351
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:53,650
...known as High Anxiety.

352
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:56,210
- High Anxiety?
- Ja.

353
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:01,160
Do you mean to say
that Dr. Richard Thorndyke...

354
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:04,050
...one of the world's
greatest psychiatric authorities...

355
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:06,080
...is suffering from High Anxiety?

356
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:09,880
Ja, but you would not breathe
a word of this to anyone, would you?

357
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:13,920
Professor, may I remind you
that I am also a professional?

358
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:17,480
I am shocked that you would think
I'd say a word about this.

359
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:28,010
Hey, everybody,
guess who has High Anxiety?

360
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:36,160
Richard?
Falling, Mamma.

361
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:37,680
Falling. Mamma. Falling.

362
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:39,960
Richard, I'm going to bring you out.

363
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:42,560
I'm going to bring you out. I bring you out!

364
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:46,640
- Richard, my boy, Richard!
- Professor!

365
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:49,880
You'll never believe what I just
went through. It was horrible!

366
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:54,960
I would believe. But there will be
no more sessions for a while.

367
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:59,400
- So, go get yourself a little rest, my boy.
- Thank you.

368
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:02,530
- Thank you, Professor.
- Ja, auf Wiedersehen.

369
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:10,650
Let us see, here.

370
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:15,680
"Mamma, I am falling."

371
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:34,930
Norton, this is our new chief,
Dr. Thorndyke.

372
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:37,970
He'd like to see Mr. Brisbane.
Certainly.

373
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:48,920
- lt's a pleasure to meet you, Dr. Thorndyke.
- Pleasure to meet you, Norton.

374
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:53,520
Forgive me for prying.
What happened to your mustache?

375
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:58,400
As you know, we get some very violent
patients in this wing.

376
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:00,920
Last week, I guess I wasn't on my toes...

377
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:05,040
...and one of them reached out
and ripped off half of my mustache.

378
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:09,800
- That must have been awful.
- You'll never know the pain.

379
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:13,650
It can get quite dicey up here at times.

380
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:16,400
- Well, shall we go?
- Follow me.

381
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:20,320
Hey, Norton! You missing something?

382
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:47,440
That's Arthur Brisbane? The industrialist?

383
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:58,400
No. Down, Brisbane, down. Bad Brisbane.

384
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:01,320
Sit up. All right.

385
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:05,440
Don't worry, he won't bite.
Just let him smell you.

386
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:08,800
- He thinks he's a cocker spaniel.
- Cocker spaniel?

387
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:17,040
Very good.

388
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:19,920
I've never seen anything like...

389
00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:21,360
Down! Sit!

390
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:24,370
Stay!

391
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:31,040
Amazing! The most complex
psychic phenomenon I've ever witnessed.

392
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:35,040
I once read a paper when I was in college
about this, I think it was Otto Rank.

393
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:38,920
It might have been Kraft-Ebbing.
About a woman in Vienna...

394
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:42,080
...who thought that she was an animal
of some kind, an antelope...

395
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:45,520
What the hell are you...
No! Stop that!

396
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:48,600
We don't do that with strangers. Bad dog!

397
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:52,080
Get his leash, Norton.

398
00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:00,090
Extraordinary!

399
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:04,480
How could a creature have the wherewithal
to try to contact me by flashing a mirror?

400
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:07,170
Well, cockers are very bright, you know.

401
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:10,840
That's true. That's very true.

402
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:20,760
Please understand, I can't go on.

403
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:24,560
I swear to God, I won't say a word,
but I can't take it any longer.

404
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:28,440
You're just as much a part of this
as the rest of us.

405
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:33,130
No one is quitting. Do you hear me?

406
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:36,130
- No one.
- But I can't sleep at night!

407
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:39,840
What we're doing is wrong.
Don't you understand, it's wrong!

408
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:44,570
I've got to get out of here. I'm trapped!
I feel like I'm caught in a web.

409
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:48,210
Quiet, you fool! The window is open!

410
00:34:58,530 --> 00:34:59,800
All right.

411
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:02,690
Perhaps...

412
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:06,770
...l've been too harsh.

413
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:11,520
You are free to leave the Institute
this evening.

414
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:15,320
Thank you, Nurse Diesel.

415
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:18,810
And I promise I won't say anything
to anybody. Thank you.

416
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:21,360
I know you won't.

417
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:29,400
I know you won't.

418
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:55,050
Busted eardrums?

419
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:58,320
That's a very strange symptom
for a cerebral hemorrhage.

420
00:37:58,450 --> 00:38:02,570
According to the coroner's report,
he did suffer from a cerebral hemorrhage.

421
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:05,120
I can't go to San Francisco now.

422
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:08,120
Dr. Thorndyke,
there's nothing you can do.

423
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:12,360
If we receive any additional information
about Wentworth, we'll call you.

424
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:16,040
It's important that you attend
the psychiatric convention. Remember...

425
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:19,250
...you are representing the Institute.

426
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:23,290
Yes, enjoy yourself, for God's sake.
Get your mind off the Wentworth murder.

427
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:27,080
Accident. Have a good time.

428
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:30,970
I did work long and hard on that speech.

429
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:35,410
I'm going. You've convinced me. Brophy!

430
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:38,250
I'm looking for my camera,
I want to get one last shot.

431
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:40,800
Please, Brophy, not now.

432
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:42,970
Hold it!

433
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:47,600
- Okay, let's hit the road.
- Well, see you in three days.

434
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:50,160
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.

435
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:52,920
Enjoy yourself.
'Bye.

436
00:38:55,850 --> 00:38:58,650
I think you punctured something
with that last shot.

437
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:01,000
You do everything too hard. Too hard.

438
00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:03,400
Come to my room right after dinner.

439
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:06,290
Not tonight. I'm too tired.
I'm going to turn in early.

440
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:09,370
- I'll let you wear my underwear.
- I'll be there.

441
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:48,570
Thorndyke and Brophy.
Yes, sir.

442
00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:50,280
Thank you.

443
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:58,610
Dr. Richard H. Thorndyke?
Yes.

444
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:00,970
Sir, very good. Here we go, you're all set.

445
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:02,840
Wow. Talk about modern.

446
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:05,800
You and Mr. Brophy are in 1702 and 1703.

447
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:10,930
Excuse me. I thought I'd specifically
requested a room on a lower floor.

448
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:15,240
- Nothing higher than three.
- We had 201 all set for you.

449
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:19,890
But a Mr. MacGuffin called
and told us to change it to the 17th floor.

450
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:24,210
I'm sorry, we can't do a thing
about it today. We're all booked up.

451
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:26,890
Come on, Doc.
It's only for a couple of nights.

452
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:31,040
I guess it'll be all right. It's just...

453
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:35,770
...I really don't like high places.

454
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:42,410
Dennis, will you take Dr. Thorndyke
to his room, please?

455
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:44,290
Anything I can get you?

456
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:45,880
Yes. I'd like a newspaper.

457
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:48,570
I'll get you one and meet you
at the elevators.

458
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:52,090
- Please don't forget. It's rather important.
- All right, already.

459
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:57,640
I want to see if there's any mention
of Wentworth's death.

460
00:40:57,730 --> 00:40:59,690
Doc, there are the elevators.

461
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:08,210
- Come on, Doc.
- I'm coming.

462
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:16,050
Here we go. Straight to the top.

463
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:25,840
Quite a view, isn't it?

464
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:38,450
Here we are. Top floor. Top of the hotel.
You can't get any higher.

465
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:41,330
- We're pretty high.
- We know it. We know we're high.

466
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:43,280
That we know. That part we know.

467
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:54,240
Excuse me. This way.

468
00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:01,800
This way, please. Right around the corner.

469
00:42:01,930 --> 00:42:06,640
Hey, Doc, look at this.
What a view. This is spectacular.

470
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:13,050
I can see it from here.
It's very nice. Very nice indeed.

471
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:32,120
Are you all right, Doc?

472
00:42:33,330 --> 00:42:35,290
I'm all right, Brophy.

473
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:40,520
I'm sorry, sir.
I didn't know anyone was there.

474
00:42:44,210 --> 00:42:46,960
You fellas want to see your rooms or not?

475
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:51,080
Let's get out of here.

476
00:42:58,130 --> 00:43:01,360
If you would have gone over
you'd be smashed like corned beef hash.

477
00:43:01,450 --> 00:43:04,170
Your brains would have splattered
all over the lobby...

478
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:06,000
Brophy, please.

479
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:12,120
Right here is 1702. You're in 1703.

480
00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:15,210
Here's your key.
I'll bring your bag in a minute.

481
00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:17,080
See you later. Thank you.

482
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:29,130
- Here you go. Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

483
00:43:29,370 --> 00:43:32,680
- Anything else I can get you, sir?
- What happened to my newspaper?

484
00:43:32,770 --> 00:43:36,680
The newsstand didn't have any
and I didn't want to run around the corner.

485
00:43:36,770 --> 00:43:39,210
I want that newspaper.
It's very important.

486
00:43:39,290 --> 00:43:41,960
All right, I'll get your paper.

487
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:43,720
A hassle.

488
00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:46,690
Don't forget.
All right!

489
00:43:46,770 --> 00:43:50,130
What's so important about a lousy,
crummy newspaper?

490
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:04,860
Dennis, Dr. Thorndyke in room 1702
just called down to remind you...

491
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:07,220
I know. Get the newspaper!

492
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:10,410
Get the stinking newspaper!

493
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:05,940
Here!

494
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:14,610
Here's your paper!

495
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:16,570
Here's your paper!

496
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:18,410
Happy now?

497
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:47,780
That kid gets no tip.

498
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:52,940
Who is it?

499
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:55,700
Who is it?

500
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:03,210
It's not the bellboy, is it?

501
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:11,850
Get away from the door.

502
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:18,620
- Who are you?
- Get away from me.

503
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:22,050
- Just a second...
- Be quiet, they'll hear you. Don't move.

504
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:24,610
- Go inside. Go to your room.
- Go to my room.

505
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:29,290
- The drapes! Close the drapes.
- The drapes. Close the drapes.

506
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:32,210
Close the drapes.

507
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:36,140
Close the other one. Get down! Lower.

508
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:43,260
Good. Quick, come here.

509
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:47,140
Get up.

510
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:49,660
Sit down. Not there, here.

511
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:51,620
- Here?
- There.

512
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:54,610
Will you please tell me who are you
and who are they?

513
00:46:57,260 --> 00:46:59,900
Quick, make believe
you know me terribly well.

514
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:11,260
What's your sign?

515
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:14,370
I'm sorry, it's unlisted.

516
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:18,020
Boy, you sure blow hot and cold.
No offense.

517
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:20,490
Will you please tell me who you are?

518
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:24,570
My name is Victoria Brisbane.
My father is Arthur Brisbane.

519
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:27,690
You're the cocker's daughter?

520
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:31,460
Have you seen my father
at the Institute? Is he all right?

521
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:36,060
He's fine. He's coming along fine.
He's very affectionate. He licked me.

522
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:38,090
He what?

523
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:41,260
Well, he thinks he's a dog these days.

524
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:43,940
- A dog?
- Dog. Yes.

525
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:46,820
- Do you mind if I smoke?
- Not at all.

526
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:48,810
I see. A dog.

527
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:02,340
Dr. Thorndyke, I assure you
my father is just as sane as I am.

528
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:09,140
18 months ago,
he suffered a nervous breakdown.

529
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:14,490
He went into the Institute for a rest
and has been a virtual prisoner ever since.

530
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:16,620
Frankly, Doctor, I fear for his life.

531
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:20,090
Miss Brisbane, I assure you
I am a competent psychiatrist.

532
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:24,650
I've examined your father and I must
tell you, in my professional capacity...

533
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:27,020
...he is deeply disturbed.

534
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:31,700
Don't answer it. If they know I'm here,
they'll harm my father.

535
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:35,460
You're late, they're waiting.
I'll be right down.

536
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:38,450
That's Brophy, my driver. He's all right.

537
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:42,660
Miss Brisbane, I'm terribly sorry.
I must go. They're waiting for me.

538
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:45,210
Don't you believe what I'm telling you?

539
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:48,260
It's not that I don't care.
You don't understand.

540
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:52,860
I'm the principal speaker at the convention.
I must go. I'm very late.

541
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:56,530
Why don't we meet later at the bar?
We'll talk about it then.

542
00:48:56,620 --> 00:48:59,290
Fine. Later at the bar, that's perfect.

543
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:00,540
Let's go.

544
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:03,130
Here we go.

545
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:08,780
See? There's no one here.
There are no enemies.

546
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:11,330
There's nothing to worry about.

547
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:13,860
Let me see you to the elevator.
Right this way.

548
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:16,450
Nice hotel, isn't it?

549
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:18,020
Kind of high.

550
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:47,820
May I have your attention, please?

551
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:51,620
Fellow members
of the American Psychiatric Convention...

552
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:53,260
...it is a pleasure and an honor...

553
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:56,220
...to present the new head
of the Psycho-Neurotic Institute...

554
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:58,100
...for the Very, Very Nervous.

555
00:49:58,180 --> 00:50:01,780
Winner of the Nobel Prize for his works
in the use of chemotherapy...

556
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:03,740
...on severe psychosis.

557
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:07,770
The distinguished
Dr. Richard H. Thorndyke.

558
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:18,140
Thank you, Dr. Colburn.

559
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:23,210
Fellow analysts, psychiatrists...

560
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:27,260
...psychologists and laypeople...

561
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:31,250
...today I would like to discuss...

562
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:36,420
...some of the lesser known aspects
of Psychobiological Therapy.

563
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:41,740
100 years ago,
psychology was akin to witchcraft.

564
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:45,420
But some of these great people,
these giants behind me...

565
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:48,810
...gave us a nice living.

566
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:55,580
I don't know what they said.
I only know that they met.

567
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:58,130
What do you want me to do? Kill him?

568
00:50:58,220 --> 00:51:00,580
If you want me to kill him, I'll kill him.

569
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:03,410
I don't have to kill him,
but I'd like to kill him.

570
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:07,860
I killed Ashley and Wentworth. Another
killing or two won't make any difference.

571
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:11,220
It would make me happy.
I'd like to kill them both.

572
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:14,860
I think it would be better
if I killed them both.

573
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:17,220
Well, let me kill just one, then.

574
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:19,210
Whichever one you want.

575
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:21,290
All right. I'll wait.

576
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:24,020
But the minute you say kill them,
I'll kill them.

577
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:25,740
I'd love to kill them.

578
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:28,770
It would give me immense pleasure.

579
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:33,020
And so, in conclusion...

580
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:35,810
...let me reiterate...

581
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:37,860
...that there are no rules.

582
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:43,300
That each patient is a supreme individual
endowed with those qualities...

583
00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:45,770
...that distinguish the human being...

584
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:49,650
...from the slime from which he emerged.

585
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:51,820
Thank you.

586
00:51:57,020 --> 00:51:58,220
Yes, Dr. Colburn.

587
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:01,690
May I ask you a question?
Certainly.

588
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:06,380
Dr. Thorndyke, you mentioned
in your address that penis envy...

589
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:10,130
...should be deemed
an antiquated psychiatric concept.

590
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:11,580
Could you expand on that?

591
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:12,650
Of course.

592
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:16,020
Let's remember
that the term "penis envy"...

593
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:19,730
...was created in a predominantly
male atmosphere...

594
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:21,020
Excuse me.

595
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:24,860
Sorry I'm late.

596
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:27,900
Forgive me for bringing the kids.
I couldn't get a sitter.

597
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:29,460
Please, have a seat.

598
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:33,980
As I was saying, in a world of
predominantly male-oriented psychology...

599
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:37,370
...it was only natural
to arrive at the term, pee...

600
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:40,570
Pee...

601
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:43,180
"Peepee envy. "

602
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:47,170
Are you saying there's absolutely
no validity to...

603
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:51,730
...peepee envy?

604
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:57,020
It has no more validity
than if a man envied a woman's...

605
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:00,780
...balloons.

606
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:06,140
Dr. Thorndyke, do you feel
that the trauma of toilet training...

607
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:09,900
...has a bearing on the sexual future
of the adolescent?

608
00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:14,570
Toilet training. That's a vast area.

609
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:18,090
Let's be more specific.
Are we talking about...

610
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:24,380
...number one or cocky-doody?

611
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:27,890
For argument's sake, let's say cocky-doody.

612
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:30,180
I'd say professionally, cocky-doody...

613
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:34,300
...has very little to do with the future
sexual development of the adolescent.

614
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:35,530
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

615
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:39,250
Let me backtrack for a second.
The female erogenous zone.

616
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:43,820
- You mean the balloons?
- No. Lower, much lower.

617
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:48,580
Where the babies come out. The woowoo.

618
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:51,530
The woowoo?

619
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:53,890
Yes. The woowoo.

620
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:58,860
Perhaps the most significant
psychological feminine component...

621
00:53:58,940 --> 00:54:01,220
...known to mankind.

622
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:33,860
Here we are. A B&B and B&B&B.

623
00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:36,500
Thank you.

624
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:40,410
Dr. Richard H. Thorndyke.
What does the "H" stand for?

625
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:42,780
What?

626
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:44,810
Harpo.

627
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:46,580
My mother loved the Marx Brothers.

628
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:50,450
She saw all their movies.
She named me Harpo.

629
00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:51,690
Harpo?

630
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:55,130
I like it. It's very refreshing.

631
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:58,980
There are certain names that you just
don't hear very often these days.

632
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:02,740
- Anyway, here is to Daddy's recovery.
- To Daddy's recovery.

633
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:08,290
- Feeling better?
- Dr. Thorndyke.

634
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:10,850
You'll never know
how wonderful you've made me feel...

635
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:12,930
...by allowing me to visit my father.

636
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:15,660
I can't believe it.
I'm actually going to see him.

637
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:19,210
Miss Brisbane, I must warn you.
You may be in for quite a shock.

638
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:20,810
I don't care.

639
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:25,810
I just know that if I can see him and speak
with him that everything will be all right.

640
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:29,450
Hey, it's song time here at the piano bar.

641
00:55:29,540 --> 00:55:32,820
That means I lay back and let you
come forward and sing a few songs.

642
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:34,700
How about you, sir?

643
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:36,850
How about you, ma'am?

644
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:37,980
No?

645
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:40,620
How about you, Doc?
How about giving us a tune?

646
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:42,020
Me?
Yes.

647
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:43,930
I don't sing. No.

648
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:46,660
I really don't sing.
Not professionally, anyway.

649
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:49,730
Come on, Doc. Give us a song.
We'd love it.

650
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:51,250
Come on. You can do it.

651
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:53,490
Go ahead. It'll be fun.

652
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:57,620
All right. Do you know High Anxiety?

653
00:55:58,020 --> 00:56:00,220
You got it. Is B flat okay?

654
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:01,570
B flat?

655
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:03,380
The key.
The key.

656
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:06,020
That's fine, sure. I guess so. Sing in here?

657
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:07,890
Okay. Anytime.

658
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:14,130

Great town. Love that big, red machine.

Ease up on the linguine.

Hello, young lovers, whoever you are...

678
00:57:31,940 --> 00:57:34,690
What do I spy? A little grain of rice.
Newly married?

679
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:35,740
This morning.

680
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:38,780

692
00:58:40,580 --> 00:58:42,380
Jeepers, Richard, that was terrific.

693
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:44,450
- Thank you.
- I am so impressed.

694
00:58:44,540 --> 00:58:47,530
- Ever thought of singing professionally?
- No.

695
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:49,770
The big bucks are in psychiatry.

696
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:52,530
- lt's so much more emotionally rewarding.
- Exactly.

697
00:58:52,620 --> 00:58:54,770
- To help people.
- Exactly.

698
00:58:54,860 --> 00:58:56,370
Would you excuse me for a moment?

699
00:58:56,460 --> 00:58:59,530
I'll be right back.
I just have to go to the little girls' room.

700
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:00,660
Of course.

701
00:59:01,780 --> 00:59:03,690
Let me get this.
Sorry.

702
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:05,930
Here you go.
Thank you.

703
00:59:06,020 --> 00:59:09,700
Forgive me for prying,
but who is this gentleman?

704
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:12,860
What are you talking about? That's Daddy.

705
00:59:13,020 --> 00:59:16,730
Are you trying to tell me that this man
is Arthur Brisbane, your father?

706
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:18,140
Of course.

707
00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:21,690
This is not the man I met at the Institute.

708
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:25,140
Something is very, very wrong.

709
00:59:31,580 --> 00:59:34,730
What are we going to do?
This is serious. He knows.

710
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:35,890
He's seen the picture.

711
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:38,580
He knows that's not the real Brisbane
we showed him.

712
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:40,250
More coffee, please.

713
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:43,260
Charlotte, what will we do?

714
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:46,700
We'll have to kill him.
We'll have to let him kill him.

715
00:59:46,780 --> 00:59:50,620
That's all we need now. Another killing.
Give me a cookie.

716
00:59:51,620 --> 00:59:53,850
First Ashley, then Wentworth.

717
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:57,900
We can't kill Thorndyke without
the police suspecting something.

718
00:59:58,660 --> 01:00:00,970
Pass me the cream, please.

719
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:04,780
What are we going to do?
Supposing he goes to the police?

720
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:06,530
I've thought of that.

721
01:00:06,620 --> 01:00:10,090
He won't go to the police
if he can't go to the police.

722
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:13,900
I don't understand. Sugar, please.

723
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:16,970
What do you mean if he can't
go to the police? Why can't he?

724
01:00:17,060 --> 01:00:20,210
Because the police will be looking for him.

725
01:00:21,380 --> 01:00:23,660
Why would the police be looking for him?

726
01:00:23,740 --> 01:00:26,260
Because Thorndyke...

727
01:00:26,340 --> 01:00:29,570
...is going to kill somebody.

728
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:33,580
Here. Finish your strudel.

729
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:39,370
Here are the keys.

730
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:41,500
Weren't you supposed
to check out tomorrow?

731
01:00:41,580 --> 01:00:44,460
I don't know.
Early this morning, the doc called.

732
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:46,610
Said we have to get back to the Institute.

733
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:49,420
This joint is really luxurious.
I have to take a few shots.

734
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:50,650
- Do you mind?
- Not at all.

735
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:54,210
You got some joint, here.
Let me take it now. I like this joint.

736
01:00:56,420 --> 01:00:59,490
It's beautiful. It's terrific. It's gorgeous.

737
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:03,050
That's beautiful.

738
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:05,300
The elevators. Good.

739
01:01:05,820 --> 01:01:07,050
Dr. Thorndyke.

740
01:01:10,660 --> 01:01:12,250
Dr. Thorndyke.

741
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:15,610
I hear you're leaving.
What about the seminar this afternoon?

742
01:01:47,860 --> 01:01:49,340
Dr. Thorndyke?

743
01:01:50,020 --> 01:01:51,090
Yes?

744
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:53,460
Here's a little present for you.

745
01:01:57,060 --> 01:01:59,100
What is this? Who are you?

746
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:04,420
Why are you... Wait!

747
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:08,500
Who are you? What does this mean?

748
01:02:08,580 --> 01:02:10,140
What does this mean?

749
01:02:15,660 --> 01:02:18,220
That's the man!
That's the man who shot him!

750
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:21,500
No, wait. You don't understand.
This is not my gun.

751
01:02:21,580 --> 01:02:22,570
Oh, my God.

752
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:24,100
The man is dead.

753
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:27,010
I didn't... He shot him, I'm sure.

754
01:02:27,260 --> 01:02:29,490
He took off a mask. He took off my face.

755
01:02:29,660 --> 01:02:32,380
This was given to me by somebody
who looked just like me.

756
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:35,340
This is me! This is me's gun, not mine.

757
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:38,890
Gentlemen, don't go for your guns.
I'm a psychiatrist. I can help you.

758
01:02:38,980 --> 01:02:41,370
We can discuss this. We're rational...

759
01:02:45,180 --> 01:02:47,460
Doc! Why did you do it?

760
01:02:47,860 --> 01:02:49,530
Why did you do it?

761
01:02:58,020 --> 01:03:00,660
No, I'm all right. I'm just fine.

762
01:03:01,060 --> 01:03:03,130
I'm at the Golden Gate Park.

763
01:03:03,460 --> 01:03:08,300
Meet me in a half hour
at the North by Northwest corner.

764
01:03:08,820 --> 01:03:10,300
Yes. Good.

765
01:06:15,020 --> 01:06:19,970
Richard, the world has gone crazy.
Nothing makes any sense anymore.

766
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:22,180
I don't know what to believe
or not to believe.

767
01:06:22,260 --> 01:06:26,570
My life is just all topsy-turvy.
One minute you're singing love songs.

768
01:06:26,660 --> 01:06:29,860
The next minute you're pumping
bullets into an innocent man.

769
01:06:29,940 --> 01:06:32,820
Then it is not you.
It is the other Thorndyke.

770
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:37,820
How much more can a girl take?
My nerves are cracking.

771
01:06:37,900 --> 01:06:42,500
I feel like I'm going to die.
I think I am going to explode!

772
01:06:42,580 --> 01:06:45,730
Vicky! Take it easy, darling.

773
01:06:46,180 --> 01:06:47,300
I'm sorry. Forgive me.

774
01:06:47,380 --> 01:06:50,900
I'm just so close to my menstrual cycle
that I could scream.

775
01:06:53,100 --> 01:06:55,740
Vicky, please. We've got to think.

776
01:06:55,860 --> 01:06:58,820
The only way out
is to prove I didn't commit that murder.

777
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:01,340
Well, how?
Would you look at today's paper?

778
01:07:01,420 --> 01:07:04,570
Now that is you pulling the trigger.
That is nobody but you.

779
01:07:04,660 --> 01:07:07,180
Who took this picture?
How did they get it?

780
01:07:07,260 --> 01:07:09,570
Brophy. My buddy, Brophy.

781
01:07:10,820 --> 01:07:11,940
Wait a minute!

782
01:07:12,020 --> 01:07:15,170
I was coming down in the elevator
at the time of the shooting.

783
01:07:15,260 --> 01:07:16,980
Here is the elevator. Here is me.

784
01:07:17,260 --> 01:07:20,140
See that dot?
But that figure is so tiny.

785
01:07:20,220 --> 01:07:22,130
It's unrecognizable.

786
01:07:22,340 --> 01:07:25,460
Brophy has the negative.
You've got to contact Brophy.

787
01:07:25,540 --> 01:07:29,300
Have him blow up this negative
and prove that's me in the elevator.

788
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:33,170
No, he left this morning.
He's probably back at the Institute by now.

789
01:07:39,740 --> 01:07:41,730
How can you get excited
at a time like this?

790
01:07:41,820 --> 01:07:44,460
Don't get me wrong.
It's not that I'm not titillated.

791
01:07:44,540 --> 01:07:46,580
We've got to separate.

792
01:07:46,660 --> 01:07:48,170
Gosh, you're fickle.

793
01:07:48,260 --> 01:07:52,730
We can't stay together. We can't be seen.
Listen, go back to your hotel room.

794
01:07:52,820 --> 01:07:57,100
Call Brophy. Get him to blow up
that negative. I'll call you later.

795
01:08:11,260 --> 01:08:13,140
Yeah. It's coming.

796
01:08:17,780 --> 01:08:21,300
Holy Toledo, you're right!
There is a figure in the elevator.

797
01:08:21,380 --> 01:08:23,050
I think it's the doc.

798
01:08:23,780 --> 01:08:26,450
This has to be much, much bigger.

799
01:08:26,540 --> 01:08:29,980
I have to keep enlarging it
until we can clearly see the doc's face.

800
01:08:30,060 --> 01:08:31,730
Call me in an hour.

801
01:09:12,300 --> 01:09:14,020
That's the doc.

802
01:09:15,660 --> 01:09:19,650
Good work. Very good work, Brophy.

803
01:09:20,220 --> 01:09:23,340
Unfortunately, it will never be seen.

804
01:09:23,580 --> 01:09:27,100
We've got to destroy the negative.
Give us the negative, Brophy.

805
01:09:27,220 --> 01:09:30,420
You'll never get it. Never, do you hear me?

806
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:33,570
You'll never get this. I'd rather die first.

807
01:09:34,060 --> 01:09:35,570
Norton?

808
01:09:37,540 --> 01:09:38,660
Here.

809
01:09:41,540 --> 01:09:42,770
You fool.

810
01:09:42,860 --> 01:09:46,770
That negative has been on the front page
of every newspaper in San Francisco.

811
01:09:46,860 --> 01:09:48,500
They can enlarge it as well.

812
01:09:49,180 --> 01:09:52,940
You're right. I never thought of that.
We've got to think.

813
01:09:55,180 --> 01:09:59,410
I've got it! We have to buy every single
newspaper in San Francisco.

814
01:09:59,740 --> 01:10:01,890
We'll need about $10,000 worth of change.

815
01:10:01,980 --> 01:10:05,530
The first thing I want you to do
is get a truck. A big truck.

816
01:10:05,900 --> 01:10:10,610
Then you go around to all the newspaper...
All the stands. You put the paper...

817
01:10:13,540 --> 01:10:16,500
- Perhaps it's not a good idea.
- lt sucks.

818
01:10:16,980 --> 01:10:21,740
Norton, take our good friend
Mr. Brophy, here...

819
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:24,500
...to the North Wing.

820
01:10:33,380 --> 01:10:35,290
You see, darling...

821
01:10:35,380 --> 01:10:40,220
...it's not the negative that has to be
destroyed, it's Dr. Richard Thorndyke.

822
01:10:40,740 --> 01:10:45,740
I think we'd better call our friend
in San Francisco with the tin teeth.

823
01:10:46,860 --> 01:10:49,420
I get so hot when you're bad.

824
01:11:16,460 --> 01:11:17,810
Excuse me.

825
01:11:25,620 --> 01:11:26,580
Diesel, here.

826
01:11:26,660 --> 01:11:29,130
I have a collect call from San Francisco.

827
01:11:29,220 --> 01:11:30,730
Yes, I'll accept the charges.

828
01:11:30,820 --> 01:11:33,020
Hello, it's me. What do you want?

829
01:11:33,180 --> 01:11:36,940
Hello, Braces?
I have a little present for you.

830
01:11:39,620 --> 01:11:42,450
You may kill Thorndyke.

831
01:11:43,940 --> 01:11:48,140
Thank you. I really appreciate this.
I really do. Thank you.

832
01:11:55,700 --> 01:11:57,130
Life is good.

833
01:12:46,540 --> 01:12:47,610
Hello?

834
01:12:54,220 --> 01:12:56,780
Listen, mister.
I don't go for this sort of thing.

835
01:13:03,820 --> 01:13:06,940
I know a lot of the other girls
are turned on...

836
01:13:07,020 --> 01:13:09,740
...by these kinky phone calls,
but I couldn't care less.

837
01:13:13,780 --> 01:13:16,690
How did you get my room number?

838
01:13:21,180 --> 01:13:25,970
I am not going to listen to any more
of this. I've had just about enough...

839
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:28,860
What are you wearing?

840
01:13:29,580 --> 01:13:30,810
Jee...

841
01:13:32,300 --> 01:13:35,370
Jeans? You're wearing jeans?

842
01:13:36,020 --> 01:13:37,340
I bet they're tight.

843
01:13:47,860 --> 01:13:48,820
Oh, my God.

844
01:13:54,900 --> 01:13:56,570
You are an animal.

845
01:13:58,380 --> 01:13:59,530
Vicky.

846
01:14:00,020 --> 01:14:02,250
Victoria. It's me, Richard.

847
01:14:02,740 --> 01:14:04,020
Richard.

848
01:14:07,380 --> 01:14:10,930
I knew it was you all the time.
I just went along with it.

849
01:14:12,780 --> 01:14:14,740
I laughed. Did you laugh?

850
01:14:16,020 --> 01:14:18,980
Victoria, I just killed a man.

851
01:14:19,220 --> 01:14:23,610
Another one? Listen, Richard,
you've got to get a grip on yourself.

852
01:14:23,700 --> 01:14:26,220
You don't understand.
I killed the man...

853
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:29,770
...who killed the man in the lobby.
Never mind. Did you reach Brophy?

854
01:14:29,860 --> 01:14:33,700
I did and he said there was
a figure in the elevator...

855
01:14:33,780 --> 01:14:37,250
...and that it might be you and he
was enlarging it until he was certain.

856
01:14:37,860 --> 01:14:39,980
Then I waited for one hour and called back.

857
01:14:40,060 --> 01:14:41,130
And?

858
01:14:41,820 --> 01:14:44,180
And they said that he wasn't there.

859
01:14:44,260 --> 01:14:46,300
Oh, my God, they know.

860
01:14:46,620 --> 01:14:48,450
They know everything.
They've got Brophy.

861
01:14:48,540 --> 01:14:50,340
They've got the picture.

862
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:53,490
What are we going to do?
How can we prove you're innocent?

863
01:14:53,580 --> 01:14:56,300
We have to get back to the Institute
and find your father.

864
01:14:56,380 --> 01:14:59,340
We must expose Diesel and Montague
for what they are.

865
01:14:59,420 --> 01:15:00,850
How'll we leave town?

866
01:15:00,940 --> 01:15:03,850
The police are absolutely all over the place.

867
01:15:04,060 --> 01:15:06,050
Go to the Salvation Army.

868
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:07,860
The Salvation Army?

869
01:15:07,940 --> 01:15:10,460
Are they good at this sort of thing?

870
01:15:10,980 --> 01:15:15,100
No! Go to the Salvation Army and get...

871
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:46,850
Richard. Wait a minute.

872
01:15:47,260 --> 01:15:50,250
What is it?
I can't go through with this.

873
01:15:50,340 --> 01:15:52,570
I'm sorry, I just... Look at this clothing.

874
01:15:52,660 --> 01:15:55,220
What makes you think
we're actually going to sneak by?

875
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:58,900
Victoria, if we do it just the way
we rehearsed it, it will work.

876
01:15:58,980 --> 01:16:02,050
Remember, we're not sneaking by.
We have to be loud and annoying.

877
01:16:02,140 --> 01:16:05,420
If you're loud and annoying,
psychologically, people don't notice you.

878
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:07,940
Come on. We can do it.
Loud and annoying.

879
01:16:13,660 --> 01:16:16,260
I can't carry this no more.

880
01:16:16,340 --> 01:16:19,250
Celery? You had to buy in San Francisco?

881
01:16:19,340 --> 01:16:21,780
You can't get it by the market
near our house?

882
01:16:21,860 --> 01:16:25,410
Excuse me,
I bought the celery in case on the plane...

883
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:28,220
...they wanted to serve you a Bloody Mary.

884
01:16:28,620 --> 01:16:30,130
A Bloody Mary?

885
01:16:30,580 --> 01:16:34,020
Well, I don't like the Bloody Mary
they serve on the plane.

886
01:16:34,100 --> 01:16:36,170
No, sir. It's too burning.

887
01:16:36,260 --> 01:16:38,930
They don't even put tomato juice,
they put snappy peppy.

888
01:16:39,020 --> 01:16:41,170
Murray Weintraub, remember him?

889
01:16:41,340 --> 01:16:45,180
Morning, noon and night he drank
the Bloody Marys with the peppy snappy.

890
01:16:45,260 --> 01:16:48,380
You know where he is now?
Dead from that.

891
01:16:48,700 --> 01:16:51,690
Murray Weintraub is not dead.
Murray Weintraub is alive.

892
01:16:51,780 --> 01:16:52,900
No!

893
01:16:56,140 --> 01:16:59,660
Morris Turtletaub you're talking about.

894
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:03,050
The one from Great Neck
who walks sideways like this.

895
01:17:07,420 --> 01:17:11,330
No, sir. Morris Turtletaub
didn't walk like that.

896
01:17:11,420 --> 01:17:14,970
Morris Turtletaub, to my memory,
walked just like this.

897
01:17:18,140 --> 01:17:19,540
A little irregular.

898
01:17:22,540 --> 01:17:25,580
Couldn't help himself.
Come on, let's get out of here.

899
01:17:25,660 --> 01:17:27,940
Slowly.
Don't push!

900
01:17:28,020 --> 01:17:29,820
Come on.
Don't push.

901
01:17:29,900 --> 01:17:31,810
Sir, will you please put your bags up here?

902
01:17:31,900 --> 01:17:33,780
- What?
- Please put you bags right up here.

903
01:17:33,860 --> 01:17:36,820
- What do you need it for?
- We have to X-ray them, sir.

904
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:38,730
You have to X-ray?

905
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:42,450
Here. You want to X-ray the celery?
You think we're smuggling dope in here?

906
01:17:42,540 --> 01:17:45,770
- Celery is not for dope it's for dip.
- Sir, others are waiting.

907
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:49,410
- All right, go ahead. You go.
- I can't. I'm scared.

908
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:51,730
For God's sake, go through already.

909
01:17:51,940 --> 01:17:53,140
Wait a minute.

910
01:17:54,340 --> 01:17:57,780
Is this one of those blowers that blows
up the skirt, gives a free show?

911
01:17:57,860 --> 01:18:01,250
Take a chance, go through.
Don't make trouble at the airport.

912
01:18:03,540 --> 01:18:05,580
Okay, come on, Sam.

913
01:18:05,660 --> 01:18:08,180
All right. Here I go, folks.

914
01:18:09,700 --> 01:18:10,820
Sam!

915
01:18:13,660 --> 01:18:14,570
What?

916
01:18:17,420 --> 01:18:18,620
Well...

917
01:18:18,780 --> 01:18:20,100
...here I go.

918
01:18:24,300 --> 01:18:26,740
Is this a game show?
What did I win, a Pinto?

919
01:18:26,820 --> 01:18:27,890
We have to search you.

920
01:18:27,980 --> 01:18:30,130
Please, sir. What did I do?

921
01:18:30,220 --> 01:18:31,500
- What's my crime?
- You beeped.

922
01:18:31,580 --> 01:18:32,700
I beeped!

923
01:18:33,220 --> 01:18:36,130
Take me away. Take me back to Russia.
Put me in irons.

924
01:18:36,460 --> 01:18:38,610
I beeped! The mad beeper is loose.

925
01:18:38,700 --> 01:18:41,690
Take away the beeper. Put me away.

926
01:18:41,780 --> 01:18:43,900
It's all right. Please, just go.

927
01:18:43,980 --> 01:18:45,020
Thank you.

928
01:18:45,380 --> 01:18:49,420
- Richard, you were absolutely brilliant.
- You were wonderful yourself. Come on.

929
01:19:21,900 --> 01:19:23,460
Professor Lilloman?

930
01:19:24,700 --> 01:19:25,930
Professor.

931
01:19:30,460 --> 01:19:32,500
Oh, my God. He's dead!

932
01:19:32,580 --> 01:19:35,330
Dead? Who's dead?
Somebody died? Where?

933
01:19:36,340 --> 01:19:40,780
- Professor, we thought you were dead.
- I sleep that way.

934
01:19:40,860 --> 01:19:43,060
It scares the hell out of everyone.

935
01:19:43,140 --> 01:19:45,450
Professor, have you seen my father?

936
01:19:46,140 --> 01:19:48,370
Your father? Who are you?

937
01:19:48,940 --> 01:19:53,860
Forgive me. This is Victoria Brisbane.
Her father is Arthur Brisbane.

938
01:19:55,420 --> 01:19:57,650
- This is the cocker's daughter?
- Yes.

939
01:19:58,940 --> 01:20:01,930
How do you do? I'm sorry for you.

940
01:20:02,020 --> 01:20:03,300
Professor, please, Brophy.

941
01:20:03,380 --> 01:20:06,210
We are looking for Brophy.
It's important that we find him.

942
01:20:06,300 --> 01:20:07,290
Brophy.

943
01:20:07,380 --> 01:20:11,980
I'm sorry to have to tell you,
but Brophy was taken to the North Wing.

944
01:20:12,740 --> 01:20:13,700
What?

945
01:20:14,660 --> 01:20:19,210
According to Montague,
the poor chap had a mental breakdown.

946
01:20:19,660 --> 01:20:21,330
- Mental breakdown?
- Yeah.

947
01:20:21,580 --> 01:20:24,810
Brophy is not smart enough
to have a mental breakdown.

948
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:26,980
The North Wing.

949
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:30,130
- Come on, we have to go.
- I go with you, perhaps I can help.

950
01:20:30,220 --> 01:20:31,700
Come on, hurry.

951
01:20:53,260 --> 01:20:55,090
Brophy, have you seen Brisbane?

952
01:20:55,180 --> 01:20:56,660
Where is Brisbane?

953
01:20:56,740 --> 01:20:58,020
I'm sorry.

954
01:20:58,100 --> 01:21:00,060
- Where is he?
- They took him to...

955
01:21:02,700 --> 01:21:04,690
Norton's taking him up to the tower.

956
01:21:04,980 --> 01:21:06,380
Oh, my God!

957
01:21:06,460 --> 01:21:10,140
He's drugged. They're going to
throw him off, like a suicide.

958
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:12,540
Dad.

959
01:21:12,620 --> 01:21:14,290
Come on, let's go.

960
01:21:30,300 --> 01:21:31,730
There! Look!

961
01:21:32,820 --> 01:21:34,020
Daddy.

962
01:21:39,980 --> 01:21:41,460
Richard.

963
01:21:42,420 --> 01:21:44,650
- Do something.
- I'll try.

964
01:21:51,620 --> 01:21:53,210
I can't.

965
01:21:53,300 --> 01:21:54,290
What is it?

966
01:21:54,380 --> 01:21:58,170
He suffers from High Anxiety.
It strikes one out of seven.

967
01:21:58,260 --> 01:22:01,700
Don't worry, Miss. I'll stop him.
I go, too.

968
01:22:03,340 --> 01:22:06,330
Oh, God. I feel like such a...

969
01:22:06,420 --> 01:22:07,620
Coward?

970
01:22:07,860 --> 01:22:09,010
Yeah.

971
01:22:16,220 --> 01:22:17,500
I can't go on.

972
01:22:20,180 --> 01:22:22,140
I got him!

973
01:22:24,860 --> 01:22:26,450
I ain't got him.

974
01:22:28,380 --> 01:22:30,770
Where can we go? What can we do?

975
01:22:30,940 --> 01:22:32,770
- I've got to save him.
- No.

976
01:22:32,860 --> 01:22:35,420
He'll kill you. I'm going to go up.

977
01:23:30,540 --> 01:23:32,130
He's going to fall!

978
01:23:43,300 --> 01:23:46,740
Hold on! Pull yourself up! You can do it!

979
01:23:48,140 --> 01:23:49,730
I can't hang on!

980
01:23:53,180 --> 01:23:55,700
That's it! Richard, listen to me!

981
01:23:55,980 --> 01:23:59,890
I have researched your case.
I know what's giving you the High Anxiety.

982
01:23:59,980 --> 01:24:01,890
I have found the answer.

983
01:24:01,980 --> 01:24:04,210
Go back in your mind. Go back.

984
01:24:04,300 --> 01:24:05,970
You are a little baby.

985
01:24:06,060 --> 01:24:09,420
Your mother and father are fighting.
They're always fighting.

986
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:11,570
They're fighting about you.

987
01:24:19,420 --> 01:24:22,460
I hate this kid! He's making us prisoners!

988
01:24:22,540 --> 01:24:24,740
We're trapped in this house!
We can never go out!

989
01:24:24,820 --> 01:24:28,700
What do you want me to do?
Get rid of him? Is that what you want?

990
01:24:28,780 --> 01:24:30,100
Shut him up!

991
01:24:30,180 --> 01:24:32,410
Shut him up! I can't take it!

992
01:24:32,540 --> 01:24:33,970
He's falling!

993
01:24:37,780 --> 01:24:39,530
I understand now.

994
01:24:41,180 --> 01:24:44,890
It's not height I'm afraid of. It's parents!

995
01:24:45,300 --> 01:24:46,580
Ja.

996
01:24:47,980 --> 01:24:51,860
Now climb, you son-of-a-bitch. Climb!

997
01:24:58,540 --> 01:25:01,420
Come on, Doc. You can do it.

998
01:25:06,020 --> 01:25:07,850
He's almost at the top.

999
01:25:10,540 --> 01:25:11,580
Hurry, Richard.

1000
01:25:19,540 --> 01:25:20,970
Come on, Doc.

1001
01:25:38,340 --> 01:25:39,690
Norton.

1002
01:25:44,500 --> 01:25:46,220
Oh, my God.

1003
01:25:51,540 --> 01:25:54,930
- Mr. Brisbane, are you all right?
- Yes, I'm all right.

1004
01:25:56,940 --> 01:25:58,740
Get down the stairs.

1005
01:25:58,820 --> 01:26:00,890
Thank you. You saved my life.

1006
01:26:00,980 --> 01:26:02,330
Thank God it's over.

1007
01:26:25,620 --> 01:26:27,980
Fins. I give up.

1008
01:26:28,060 --> 01:26:31,130
I never really liked her. She never bathed.

1009
01:26:31,300 --> 01:26:34,660
But I like you, I'll be on your side.
I'll do anything you say.

1010
01:26:34,740 --> 01:26:38,450
I'm good at that. If I don't behave
you can beat the living crap out of me.

1011
01:26:38,540 --> 01:26:40,020
I wouldn't mind.

1012
01:26:41,340 --> 01:26:43,620
Are you all right? We saw a figure fall.

1013
01:26:43,700 --> 01:26:46,060
That was Nurse Diesel,
she went out this window.

1014
01:26:46,140 --> 01:26:48,610
Daddy, I love you.
My baby.

1015
01:26:48,700 --> 01:26:50,340
My boss.

1016
01:26:50,540 --> 01:26:52,930
Brophy.
My Richard.

1017
01:26:53,580 --> 01:26:55,330
Professor.

1018
01:26:55,820 --> 01:26:57,410
- You saved my life.
- Ja.

1019
01:26:57,780 --> 01:26:59,980
You saved my life. Who are you?

1020
01:27:00,060 --> 01:27:01,260
Dad.

1021
01:27:02,500 --> 01:27:04,860
This is the man I'm going to marry.

1022
01:27:04,980 --> 01:27:08,180
Jeepers, Vicky.
Isn't he a dreamboat?

1023
01:27:11,060 --> 01:27:12,380
Goodbye, Dad.

1024
01:27:22,180 --> 01:27:24,460
I absolutely love my new name.

1025
01:27:24,820 --> 01:27:27,890
Mrs. Victoria Harpo Thorndyke.

1026
01:27:28,620 --> 01:27:32,220
Mrs. Dr. Victoria Harpo Thorndyke.

1027
01:27:32,460 --> 01:27:34,020
Yes. Doctor?

1028
01:27:34,740 --> 01:27:36,570
I'm having this problem.

1029
01:27:36,940 --> 01:27:38,500
Problem? Well...

1030
01:27:38,700 --> 01:27:41,260
...maybe we should examine the situation.

1031
01:27:41,340 --> 01:27:43,810
Nice shot.
Pull the camera back slowly.

1032
01:27:43,900 --> 01:27:46,940
We're going too fast,
we're going to hit the wall.

1033
01:27:50,060 --> 01:27:51,570
Now what do we do?

1034
01:27:51,660 --> 01:27:55,180
Never mind. Keep pulling back.
Maybe nobody will notice.

1035
