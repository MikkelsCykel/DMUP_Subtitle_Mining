1
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,320
I tailed Kerr from the factory.
I lost him.

2
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,920
But I saw it land:
their Interflug 747.

3
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,240
An hour ago.
When I asked for Orgenov,

4
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,040
this asshole in Defense Ministry
said he was unavailable.

5
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:57,680
Probably blind drunk. Then he denied
that any plane had been hijacked.

6
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,640
So what are the tire marks
on the roof of my car?

7
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,400
Somewhere in the desert.
I don't know where they'll hide it.

8
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,840
It's too late to bring ethics
into this. Way too late.

9
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,560
I can't do it.
I can't!

10
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,600
These are our own people,
for Christ's sake.

11
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,160
Face reality. It's over.

12
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,880
They know we turned on them.

13
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,520
They won't sleep till we're dead.

14
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:36,040
I'm leaving Tucson.
If you're smart, so will you.

15
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,280
Where's your roommate?

16
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,280
Better tell me.

17
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,560
Wanna talk now or what?

18
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,240
Hey! Where is she?

19
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,840
Don't you think you were
a little rough on her?

20
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,200
I don't know. It'll look like she
slipped in the shower.

21
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,640
- What about the roommate?
- We'll be back.

22
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,720
Oof. This car
brings me to my knees.

23
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,400
- You did good up there.
- Oh, shut up.

24
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,760
Temperatures are already dropping,
along with the barometer... Whoa!

25
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,080
What on...

26
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,000
- Is this the bachelorette party for...
- It's Bernadette's party.

27
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,360
- Bernadette is eight years old today.
- Oh.

28
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,000
Well, in case you missed it, there
was a U.F.O. spotted over Phoenix today.

29
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,720
That's "Unidentified
Falling Object. "

30
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,760
You may remember 31-year-old Richard
Brodie from another high-profile escapade.

31
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,400
Last year Brodie skydived into
a football game at Sun Devils stadium...

32
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,880
and proceeded to pick up the ball
and run for a touchdown.

33
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
He was tackled in the end zone
by both teams.

34
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,240
As a result of today's stunt, police
charged the wayward skydiver...

35
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,440
with violating
restricted air space.

36
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,440
The F.A.A. is said
to be investigating.

37
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,040
Ahh!

38
00:08:51,120 --> 00:09:03,280
¢Ü ¢Ü

39
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,800
¢Ü Got a ten-room house
that overlooks the sea ¢Ü

40
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,560
¢Ü Got a boss at work
who's overlookin' me... ¢Ü ¢Ü

41
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,840
- Polyester makin' a comeback?
- Loaner clothes. County jail.

42
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,440
Uh-huh. Suit with
the breakaway buttocks?

43
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:21,520
- Tryin' to pick up a little extra cash,
 Jo. A man's gotta eat.
- Yeah? Eat this.

44
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:26,280
F.A.A. inspection report. They hit us
with 12 safety violations last month.

45
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,200
That's the most for any jump center
in the country. And now, you pull this.

46
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,560
- Wow. The most ever?
- Yeah.

47
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,480
Thank you, thank you. All right, relax.

48
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,560
Shut up!

49
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,520
We're already
on the F.A.A. hit list.

50
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,560
You pull a stupid stunt like this,
it hurts everyone here.

51
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,280
Now you listen to me.
Until we pass the next inspection,

52
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,720
there will be no more base jumps
off of radar towers.

53
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:58,000
No more bungee jumps off construction
cranes while they're operating.

54
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,520
And, Ditch, no more low altitude pulls.
You're going to bounce.

55
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:07,560
Yeah. Can I use a Q-tip inside
my ear or just around the edge?

56
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,960
This is serious. Knock it off.
Quit kiddin' around.

57
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,840
All right. Ease up, Jo.
Just tell me what you need done.

58
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:16,640
Reserve chute inspections,
A.O.D. checks, pH tests.

59
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,720
- All the things I put on the list.
- What list?

60
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:23,080
The list I put on your desk
last week.

61
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,000
You put it in there?

62
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,960
- Hey, handsome.
- Hiya, Max. How are you?

63
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,560
You gonna be done soon?

64
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,040
Yeah, soon as I file this half
of the room and chrome that half.

65
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,920
Got a new student needs a lesson.
Think you can handle it?

66
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,600
- You better run it past Jo.
- Can't do that. Jo...

67
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,760
This is not you.

68
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,840
- Afraid so.
- This is you!

69
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:50,440
Oh, my God. I didn't know you were
one of those big gymnast guys.

70
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,240
How come you never showed this
to anyone? You look so cute.

71
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,720
- See the haircut? That's how come.
- Uh-huh.

72
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,800
You are so funny.

73
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,440
Ahem. Okay. Jo's gone into Phoenix,
and I got four phone calls on hold.

74
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:07,400
I really need you to schedule
this lesson for me, okay? Please?

75
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,040
All right.
Where is he?

76
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,640
It's a she.

77
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,760
My.

78
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,200
You better get on
those phone calls, Max.

79
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,240
- Yeah. Yeah.
- See ya later.

80
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,480
Uh-huh. See ya.

81
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,880
I can't believe I'm doing this.
You're the instructor?

82
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,320
Yes. Ditch Brodie.

83
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,040
If you saw the recent media coverage,
it was all a pack of lies.

84
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,960
- Sorry. I didn't know.
- Good.

85
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:45,200
- Um, Chris Morrow. Hi.
- Hi, Chris.

86
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,360
I, uh, wanted to take
a lesson today, so...

87
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,880
I think I do...
Yeah, I think I do.

88
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,560
- So it's a rush, right?
- Oh, yeah.

89
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,600
That's what I keep reading.
Just like a great high, right?

90
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,560
- Let me guess. First time?
- How'd you know?

91
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,520
Just a hunch.

92
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,680
Listen, Chris,
I'm a little shorthanded today.

93
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,760
The good news is I can squeeze you in
first thing Friday morning.

94
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,720
- How's that sound?
- Hey, Ditch, if you're grounded, 
maybe I could...

95
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:13,280
Hello, Tom. Bye, Tom.
Hey, guys, it's me, all right?

96
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,600
- Ditch?
- You don't want Tom.

97
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,360
- Why not?
- Because you want the best, 
and you're already talkin' to him.

98
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,600
- How does Friday sound?
- Right. Um...

99
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,040
I don't know.
Maybe.

100
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:31,000
You see, it took me a while to work up
the nerve to just drive here,

101
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,440
and I think if I don't
do it today, right now,

102
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,400
I'm afraid I may
never come back.

103
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,720
Ever?

104
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,920
Um, no.

105
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,720
Oh, boy.

106
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,640
- Okay.
- Yeah?

107
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,560
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God!

108
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,640
Now, first lesson,
I usually recommend a tandem jump.

109
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,640
- Which is?
- We go out of the plane together.

110
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:00,520
I hang onto you the entire way down.
It's a nice, safe, secure feeling.

111
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,760
Right.
Like that?

112
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,200
Unless you prefer
to be on top.

113
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,120
No. No.

114
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,680
Um, someone mentioned
a static line.

115
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,280
- C-Could we try that or...
- Yeah, it's an option.

116
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,200
- That's safe, right?
- Yeah.

117
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,680
- So we're on.
- This is good. I'm excited.

118
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,840
- Oh, God.
- I mean, I'm excited.

119
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:28,040
- Oh, really? Okay.
- Let's sign you up, all right?

120
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,040
- Break.
- You dip your right shoulder, 
then move to the right.

121
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,960
Your other right.
There you go.

122
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:38,080
Dip your left shoulder
and move to the left. Feel that?

123
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,320
Stay in the middle,
you're flyin' stable. How's that feel?

124
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,520
I don't know. I'm not very athletic.

125
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,440
It's not too late
to switch to tandem.

126
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:52,160
Oh, we'll stick with this,
as long as it's safe, I mean.

127
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:55,880
Very safe. Let's get you out of
the harness and go find you a jumpsuit.

128
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,040
How about this?

129
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,840
It's cute, but it's a little baggy,
don't you think?

130
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:09,440
- How about this gray one? It's smaller.
- I think the orange works.

131
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,600
- Cool.
- Do I have time to make a call?

132
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,520
I promised my roommate one last chance
to talk me out of this.

133
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,760
- Sure. Phone's over there.
- Great. Thanks. What about this?

134
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,720
- I'll take that into the locker room for you.
- You sure?

135
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,840
- Yeah.
- She's gorgeous but cheap.

136
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,160
- What's that?
- Your new student. She's stingy.

137
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,880
I offered to tape her jump,
special introductory price: $59.95.

138
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,680
She played me like a video game.
Maybe you could talk her into it.

139
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,600
I got something else in mind.

140
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,480
- It's 12:30 now.
- Uh-huh?

141
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,400
We do the jump,
grab a Coke afterwards,

142
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,960
talk about our bonding experience
on the way down.

143
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,920
Leave her a message
around 5:00, 5:30...

144
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,600
- "Hey, what's up? It's me, Ditch. "
- Right. Dinner.

145
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,560
- Yady-yady-yada.
- Yady-yady-yada.

146
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,720
Her place. Kick the stuffed animals
off the bed by 9:45.

147
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,160
- I'm home by 11:30.
- In time to watch Leno.

148
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,440
- Yep. What do you think?
- I say go for it.

149
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,360
I'm all over it.

150
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,200
Up you go.

151
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,120
Dirt alert.

152
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,040
- Huh?
- You only hear this for eight seconds.

153
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,360
- And then what?
- Splat.

154
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:55,160
Scattered clouds.
You wanna go upstairs?

155
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,160
Maybe
six grand, huh?

156
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,960
- Just find us some good air.
- Roger.

157
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,440
Still got a few minutes.
Just relax.

158
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,040
Between your legs?

159
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,080
- Best seat in the house.
- Why do you pretend that that's what you're about?

160
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,960
What makes you think
I'm pretending?

161
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:20,760
Because I'd be stupid to trust
my life with a walking penis.

162
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,480
And I'm not stupid.

163
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,040
I'm much more than a walking penis.
I'm a flying penis.

164
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,840
Yes, you are.

165
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,480
Remember: hard arch
into the wind.

166
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:48,200
Now, your chute opens automatically,
but look up and check it.

167
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:53,240
Be sure that it's opened. If it hasn't,
cut away. Use your reserve.

168
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,840
Hello.
I'm over here.

169
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,720
I thought I saw another plane.
Is that safe?

170
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:11,320
- We got company?
- Not that I see.

171
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,320
- Let's get ready to jump-run.
- Mmm.

172
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,960
Now when you fi...

173
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,920
Jesus!

174
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,680
Ahh! Pull your cord!

175
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,400
Pull! Pull! Pull!

176
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,560
Ah! Ah!
Shit.

177
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,280
Hold it.

178
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,800
We used to joke
about it, didn't we?

179
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:03,000
'Bout some student hittin' the dirt
and diggin' in like Wile E. Coyote.

180
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,120
I saw her, man.

181
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,320
I was right here
videotaping landings.

182
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,840
I saw her bounce.

183
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:20,520
I don't think we'll be
joking about it anymore.

184
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,120
What happened, man?

185
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,040
How'd she get
away from you?

186
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,280
I'm very calm!

187
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,120
We're flying. I looked back...
You think I'm lying, don't you?

188
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,520
I looked back.
Then she's gone.

189
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,160
She's gone! One minute she's there;
the next, she's gone.

190
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:33,040
You're up next.
These guys are tough.

191
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:37,040
I could have sworn
I did her dope-rope.

192
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:40,160
I could have sworn
I hooked her in.

193
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,160
Sometimes you do it when you load up;
other times, right before you jump.

194
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,960
But I could have sworn...

195
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,480
Handsome gal, she was.

196
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:52,840
- Yeah. And?
- Hell. An angel like that walks in,

197
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,640
a man starts thinkin'
with his little head.

198
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,040
I hooked her in, Noble!

199
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,400
Like I've done
thousands of times!

200
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,400
That's what you can tell
the F.A.A. guys.

201
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,000
Then what do I say?
I saw the line break?

202
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,920
That she
unhooked herself?

203
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,400
I never saw the line
on her, son.

204
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,320
That's all I can say...

205
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,240
if they ask me.

206
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,320
Unhooked herself.

207
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,720
Come on, man. Nobody's gonna do this.
There's easier ways to kill yourself.

208
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,680
Earth's rushing up at you at 120 miles
an hour, and all you gotta do is not pull?

209
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,080
What's easier than that?

210
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,760
Come on. After all these years,
you never thought about it?

211
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,560
No, man. I never have.

212
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:18,400
Hey, wait a minute. That must be
her roommate. She called her roommate.

213
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,800
"2201 High Desert Road. "

214
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,320
Tucson.

215
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,680
Hello?

216
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,520
Not very athletic.

217
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,440
Yeah, right.

218
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,880
A Boss fan.

219
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,680
Come here!

220
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,320
Who the hell are you?

221
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,320
What are you,
the boyfriend? Huh?

222
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,200
Hey, boyfriend.

223
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,120
Where's the body?

224
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,560
Who the hell are you?

225
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,280
Well... here's my card.

226
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,920
Where's the body?

227
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,160
I'll give you
30 bucks for it.

228
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:59,560
- I just want to get an idea where it's from.
- It's a handy little poker.

229
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:03,200
But it's seen better days.
Phosphate finish.

230
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:07,480
Steel hammerbutt cap.
Sawtooth back edge for wire cutting.

231
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:10,680
- Ninety bucks, my final offer.
- What about these markings?

232
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,080
- Cyrillic.
- From Syria?

233
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,840
Ditch, I don't got all day.

234
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,560
Take my dough
or take a hike.

235
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,920
- How fast this thing go?
- 'Bout 350.

236
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:43,040
- You're gonna kill yourself.
- Exactly. But what a ride.

237
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,840
Hello? Hello!

238
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,680
Hello? Hello!

239
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,240
Anybody here?

240
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,320
Hello!

241
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,680
- Richard Brodie?
- Maybe.

242
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:04,520
You know, this dust
that you have out here?

243
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,520
It just kills me. How do
you stand it every day?

244
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,640
I like dust.
Who are you?

245
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:13,360
My name is Ben...
... Pinkwater.

246
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:18,160
I called earlier, and, uh, there was no
answer. So I figured I'd take a chance.

247
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:21,880
I'm glad I did 'cause I need to speak
with you about a Chris Morrow.

248
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,680
- Can't you F.A.A. guys just get off my back?
- Sorry, I'm not from the F.A.A.

249
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:31,880
Maybe I wasn't clear. Um, I'm the, uh,
Deputy District Attorney of Tucson.

250
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,360
I'm here to determine whether manslaughter
charges should be brought against you...

251
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,120
in Chris Morrow's death.

252
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,080
You're kidding.

253
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,640
I don't know
what the hell's goin' on,

254
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,840
except somebody's doin'
a major number on my head.

255
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:52,280
Yes, well, let's just
stick to specifics, shall we?

256
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,360
I find it works
better that way.

257
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,800
Yesterday, this
wet dream walks in,

258
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,840
all cute and jittery like she's
never been on a jump before.

259
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,760
Then I find this
in her apartment.

260
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,120
So you think she misrepresented
her actual abilities.

261
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,320
I think she did for bullshit
what Stonehenge did for rocks.

262
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,480
That's very good.

263
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,480
That's very funny.

264
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:19,960
Uh... What were you 
doing in her apartment?

265
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,360
Lookin' for her roommate.

266
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:26,640
Instead I get attacked 
by some jamoke with pink rubber 
gloves and a bad Sinatra cut.

267
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,800
Let's backtrack a little bit. How did
you gain access to her apartment?

268
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,760
- I used keys.
- Whose keys?

269
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,680
- Her keys.
- Without any permission.

270
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:38,080
She's dead, remember?

271
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,960
What do you want
from me?

272
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,960
I just want the truth.

273
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,400
No, you just want
someone to hang.

274
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:50,480
Richard. M-May I
call you Richard?

275
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,920
Ahem.

276
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,240
I know guys like you don't like
guys like me, a-and that's fine.

277
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,880
But let me suggest
you drop the attitude.

278
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,920
Okay? Because if you
take a look around,

279
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:10,000
you'll see I'm the only guy here
tryin' to help you.

280
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,680
Just... work with me.

281
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,040
Look, here's my card.

282
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,200
If you think
of anything else,

283
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,640
you beep me,
day or night.

284
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,160
- Okay?
- Okay.

285
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,320
Oh, oh, uh...
One more thing.

286
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:37,040
Uh, did anyone take any pictures
or video or anything like that?

287
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,480
I can look, but I...
I don't think so. No.

288
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:45,080
Okay.
All right.

289
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,480
- I'll be in touch.
- All right.

290
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,840
- Get some rest.
- I will.

291
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:59,400
Robocam with the cavity-cam.
What's up, pretty lady?

292
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,720
- Be natural, all right?
- I'm always natural.

293
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:08,880
Oh, God. Well, it's like
you just feel free.

294
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,560
Like a bird.

295
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,760
I always think
of that song "Free Bird. "

296
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,600
- Do you know it?
- Holy shit!

297
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,880
There was another plane.

298
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:29,640
All right, Slammo,
who the hell are you?

299
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,920
Come on, man! What are
you buzzing me for?

300
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,520
Because apparently, 
Ditch, you needed a tour guide 
to find your way here.

301
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:43,280
- What took you so long?
- What I don't understand, lady,

302
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:46,120
is how you're still vertical.
Why don't we start there, all right?

303
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,760
The woman you saw falling
wasn't me.

304
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:54,200
It was a female body dressed
in an orange jumpsuit.

305
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,800
The suits from your jump center
were easy enough to copy.

306
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,880
Okay. Okay, I'm startin'
to catch on, I think.

307
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,240
So you unhook while I'm up front
checkin' for traffic, and then...

308
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:10,640
She jumps. She max-tracks into
the blind spot behind your plane.

309
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:13,920
A body drops from the plane
above you: mine.

310
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,880
Shadowing above.

311
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,320
You look out, see her falling.
Or think you do.

312
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,680
Actually, I'm on my way
landing a mile off.

313
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,840
I see.

314
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:26,520
Yeah, I was this close
to puttin' it together.

315
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,400
Of course you were.

316
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:32,440
All right, so you've fooled a guy who
can't get his sideburns even when he shaves.

317
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,960
- What about the coroner?
- Terminal velocity.

318
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,600
How fast does
an unstable body fall?

319
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:41,080
110, 120 miles an hour?

320
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:44,040
- Yeah, about 110, 120...
- Miles an hour.

321
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:49,240
Well, forget the dental records.
Her teeth are Chicklets.

322
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:52,160
What about fingerprints?
You could still I.D. her that way.

323
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:55,480
But they wouldn't, not if
there was a simpler way.

324
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:01,440
Like all of us on the ground
tellin' the cops who it was.

325
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:05,280
Let me ask you somethin'.

326
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,200
Who was the corpse?

327
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,080
I'll tell you on the plane.
We have to leave now.

328
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:18,560
What do I look like here, a brain donor? The
only place I'm goin' is the county sheriff.

329
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:21,560
- Think they'll believe you? 
- They will as soon
as the coroner double
-checks the fingerprints.

330
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,720
They got somebody
on ice, right?

331
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,920
- Late again, Ditch.
- What do you mean?

332
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,840
Funeral director claimed the body
for cremation this morning.

333
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:33,200
- What funeral director?
- Ditch, meet Lex.

334
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,560
I don't think you really understand
what's happening here.

335
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:40,200
I got some D.A. talkin'
about manslaughter charges.

336
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:43,600
I'm not surprised, with
a safety record like yours.

337
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:47,280
What was it, 12 violations
just last month?

338
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,760
What kind of prison term
was he talkin'? Five years? Six?

339
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,960
If they prove negligence,
there'll be two or three more years.

340
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:56,000
- That's right.
- You've been workin' me 
from the start, haven't you?

341
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:02,440
Look, Ditch, you have a right to feel
used and deceived, because you were.

342
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:05,560
But if you come with me now,
I'll set the record straight.

343
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:09,360
I will hand you physical proof
that I'm still alive. I promise.

344
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,640
You just have to do
one thing for me first.

345
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,000
Wh-Wh-What do I...

346
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,440
I'm going, Ditch.
You're in or out.

347
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,320
I don't believe this.

348
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,480
Up you go.

349
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,280
Put these on.

350
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,520
Let me see if
I've got this straight.

351
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,680
You dumped your own roommate out
of a plane, and she was already dead?

352
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:53,280
- It served a cause.
- Aw, lady, that's cold.

353
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:56,720
Well, they would have murdered me too
unless I killed myself first.

354
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,840
I just had to
buy some time.

355
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:02,200
- We're gettin' close.
- I just want you to know...

356
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,960
that the idea of following you out that
door again makes me very uncomfortable.

357
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,880
Are you afraid
of a night jump?

358
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,320
- Hey, I invented the night jump.
- What are you afraid of then?

359
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,960
- Who says I'm afraid of anything?
- You're shaking.

360
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,000
The whole plane is shaking.

361
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,480
Not that your orientation
wasn't thorough or anything,

362
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,760
but do you mind tellin' me
what the hell we're doing?

363
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:31,880
- I'll tell you on the way down.
- Beautiful.

364
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,760
- Can you hear me?
- Hello.

365
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:25,280
Is this Suzie, my Time-Life operator? Hey,
what is this? That aerospace plant out by...

366
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:29,640
- You should speak only when 
asked a direct question.
- What are we doin' here?

367
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:33,560
We're here to retrieve vital
information. Do you see the north rooftop?

368
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,040
- Yeah, okay. Piece of cake.
- Don't land there.

369
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,960
- Don't?
- The roof has motion sensors.

370
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,960
See the red lights on
the west end of the tower?

371
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:46,600
- Can you hit it dead center?
- You kiddin' me? In these winds?

372
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,320
Oh, shi-i-i-i-i-t!

373
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,920
Goddamn it.

374
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,400
You there?
Ditch? Ditch?

375
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:32,920
Ditch, are you there?

376
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:41,360
Yeah, I'm here. Tell me you didn't send
me down this shit chute on purpose.

377
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:49,280
Keep your voice down and make your way to
the south side. There's a breaker board there.

378
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:25,720
- Okay. I'm here.
- Throw switches 17 and 23.

379
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,640
You just cut the juice
to the security fence.

380
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:37,880
You need to move upstairs
and find door 207.

381
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,040
The one marked
"Authorized Personnel. "

382
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:43,160
- Should I be writin' all this down?
- Just go!

383
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,280
A little close.

384
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:07,360
I'm here. 207.
Authorized personnel only.

385
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,320
Use the key and go inside.

386
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:13,360
- What key?
- The one in your hook-knife sleeve.

387
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:19,200
How convenient.

388
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:25,120
I'm in.

389
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:30,320
How do you know your way
around this place so well?

390
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,560
Never mind.

391
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:45,160
The money will be wired in the morning.

392
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:47,320
We'll fly the shipment
out tomorrow night.

393
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,240
Put the full crew on standby.

394
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:51,440
Let's try not to mess it up.
All right.

395
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:03,960
Go to the closet.
It should be on your right.

396
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,320
- Okay. I see it.
- Open it.

397
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:12,560
Now... take the clothes
off the hanger pole.

398
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:15,680
Don't need to. I see the safe.
What's the combo?

399
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:19,840
Forget the safe.
It's only there to distract idiots.

400
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:22,240
Now lift out the hanger pole
and look inside.

401
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:41,480
You know those robots the bomb squad
uses? That's what I am, isn't it? Huh?

402
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,920
Kerr, check this out.

403
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:51,280
That's the fence perimeter.
Light it up!

404
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:55,920
Now replace the hanger pole, and leave
everything exactly as you found it.

405
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:59,000
Oh, no!

406
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:01,240
Ditch? Ditch!

407
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:05,240
We might, uh, have a...
have a problem here.

408
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:10,840
I'm checkin'
the perimeter.

409
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:15,280
If you can make it to the west door, 
you can make it out. 
Now move, move, move!

410
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,960
Look. It's him.
He's goin' to the roof.

411
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:08,520
You stay here!
Watch the exits.

412
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:13,360
Ditch Brodie!

413
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:16,960
Ah!

414
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,320
Ditch, you're on your own.

415
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:06,600
He's going to jump!

416
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:53,440
- Hello.
- Do you still have the cylinder?

417
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:56,400
Yeah, I'm fine, thanks.
Question:

418
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:59,680
Who were those goons tonight?
Was that Russian they were speaking?

419
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:02,640
And don't tell me it was French,
parce que je parle francais, honey.

420
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:06,120
- Those men are Mafia.
- Mafia. Please.

421
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:10,240
There's more than one kind of Mafia,
Ditch. I'll be there in 15 minutes.

422
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:14,800
I won't be. I'm headin' out to Sam's
Surplus, Highway 18 near the aqueduct.

423
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:17,440
Are you getting this?
I'll bring the cylinder and a witness.

424
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:21,880
- You bring that pretty face and your attitude.
- What are you doing, Ditch?

425
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,800
What am I doin'? Puttin' this mess
in my rearview mirror.

426
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:29,120
I told you I'd take care of your problem
and I will, but it has to be done my way.

427
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,440
Highway 18.
Sam's Surplus.

428
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,040
- Anything?
- Not yet.

429
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:51,960
Forgive the skepticism
on the phone...

430
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:54,360
No, I know how
it sounds, believe me.

431
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:58,800
- You're certain this woman is the same woman 
that was in the plane with you.
- Absolutely.

432
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:02,240
She said she's
from the C.I.A.

433
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,600
C.I.A., I.R.S.
Mafia, I don't know.

434
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:08,880
I just want you to see her face, see that
she's come back from the dead, all right?

435
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:12,680
- This is incredible.
- I know.

436
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,800
- Would you like a Certs?
- No, thanks.

437
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,720
I'm sorry.
It's a nervous habit that I have.

438
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,640
Give me those.

439
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:29,240
Don't take them all.

440
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:48,400
That's her.

441
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:51,080
- She's coming in a plane.
- Yes, she has a plane.

442
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:02,040
Now, uh, I think
the smart thing to do here...

443
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:05,320
would be to get her away from the plane
and make her come to us.

444
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,360
No, I think
I should go to her.

445
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:13,640
- Fine. Go to her. I'll stay here.
- Good.

446
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,600
Fine.

447
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:21,760
Two men,
one coming this way.

448
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:25,320
Looks like your stooge.

449
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,720
- The cylinder's in my car.
- Bring your car.

450
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:40,560
- My witness is back that away.
- Bring him and the car.

451
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:43,080
He's a little jumpy.
I think we should go to him.

452
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,040
Chris.

453
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:51,480
I don't like this.
Let me go instead.

454
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:55,320
Just keep an eye on me.

455
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:58,560
- What if things get out of hand?
- I'll kill 'em.

456
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:05,320
- Let's go.
- Great.

457
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:17,960
- Where's your witness? - Probably
in his car power-locking the doors.

458
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:21,320
He's not used to all this
cloak-and-dagger stuff.

459
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:24,360
- There's a rifle on us. 
Any attempt to detain me...
- Calm down.

460
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:27,160
The guy just wants to watch you
breathe a couple of times, all right?

461
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:32,680
- What do you see, Lex?
- Now, he said he would wait right here.

462
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:38,560
Lex?

463
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,920
Lex?

464
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:48,880
What are you doing?
Hey! Get back here!

465
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:54,960
Pinkwater!
What is goin' on here?

466
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,280
Welcome, Comrade.

467
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:24,880
- Get down! Get down!
- What, what, what?

468
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:32,600
They're not gonna damage
my car, are they?

469
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:34,920
- Here, this is your gun.
- My gun?

470
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,600
Shoot!

471
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:49,120
- Ah, it's broken!
- The safety's on, you idiot!

472
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:55,440
Jesus Christ!

473
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:02,880
No! No!

474
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:06,720
Ah! Jesus Christ!

475
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:12,320
Run!

476
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:29,080
Whoa! Mother of God!

477
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:34,480
What's going on out here?

478
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:45,200
- Where's the cylinder?
- Who started shooting? 
It scared off my D.A.!

479
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:47,160
- That's not a D.A.
- Who the hell is he?

480
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:50,320
He's one of the killers!

481
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,640
- Give me the gun!
- What are you doing?

482
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:08,960
- You said that was my gun!
- Not anymore!

483
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:14,480
- That freakin' witch broke my nose! 
I want her dead!
- No kidding.

484
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:19,760
You have five seconds to tell me
where the cylinder is. One.

485
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:22,600
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Two!

486
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:24,640
- Five!
- What the hell happened to three?

487
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:26,760
Three got his balls blown off
while you were counting!

488
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,320
Okay. Relax.
The cylinder is in my...

489
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:39,080
car?

490
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:45,400
Come on!

491
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:26,520
How do you stop this thing?

492
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:52,440
Come on!

493
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:14,520
- Ditch!
- Oh, God!

494
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:43,040
What are we doin'? Covering our scent?
I didn't see any dogs.

495
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:45,320
Why don't you tell me
who you are for real?

496
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,600
What does it matter?
We'll be dead in a few hours anyway.

497
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:50,320
Well, that's comforting.
Hey! Woman!

498
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:51,960
What?

499
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:59,240
- Excuse me?
- K.G.B. for short.

500
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:03,200
- Oh, come on! It's the K.G. 
used-to-be.
- Don't be naive.

501
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:06,320
So you're sayin' that,
that you and, and,

502
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:09,240
and Lex and Pinkwater and
Blondie are all Russian spies?

503
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:13,080
I'm saying we were.
We've been laid off!

504
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:18,440
K.G.B. laid off.
Auto workers get laid off!

505
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:38,640
I tell ya, one day this bitch
is gonna run out of lives.

506
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:48,600
Where'd you learn that?

507
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:51,680
Moscow. I was gonna
go there once.

508
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:53,600
You have excellent
pronunciation.

509
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:55,960
- How do you say "ass"?
- Zhopa.

510
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:57,880
Well, no smoke up
my zhopa, please.

511
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:02,680
So, when was this?
Moscow.

512
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:05,560
Ancient history.
'80 Olympics.

513
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:09,440
- Well, America boycotted that year.
- Yeah, rub my nose in it.

514
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:12,880
- You were on the team?
- Gymnastics.

515
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:16,600
Trained for ten years.
Qualified in two events.

516
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:19,520
All I wanted was a shot
at that Russian gold.

517
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:21,400
Look at the haircut.

518
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,240
- Here.
- No, keep it. I got more.

519
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:32,640
You were young then. God. Sixteen.
Seventeen. Why didn't you try again in '84?

520
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:36,440
I probably should've. 
I wasn't about to let my teeth 
get kicked in like that again.

521
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:54,320
It's them!

522
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:46,400
This makes a lot of sense.
light a fire when we're being chased.

523
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:49,320
Don't worry. I know them.
They never backtrack.

524
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:53,640
Right. Russian Mafia.
Amazing.

525
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:00,560
Well...

526
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:04,160
What have we here?

527
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:14,800
- Want a slam?
- Mm. No.

528
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:33,560
Krista.

529
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:35,680
Excuse me?

530
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:39,280
My real name is
Krista Moldova.

531
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:42,360
That's very nice.
It's very pretty.

532
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:45,400
Anything you wanna toast to,
Krista Moldova?

533
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:47,600
You're Richard.
Richard, right?

534
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:50,520
Yeah. I don't know.
Somehow, uh,

535
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:53,680
Rich and then Dick
got slammed up into Ditch.

536
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:57,640
Richard is nice.

537
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:03,560
- How long you been away?
- Oh, years.

538
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:05,360
I'll have some.

539
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:09,280
Y- You might wanna
let that breathe... there.

540
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:15,800
They're all back there.
Brother, father, mother.

541
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:19,000
And a little dog. Tambov.

542
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:21,760
Got hit by a car
last I heard and lost a leg.

543
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:24,440
Aw, that's terrible.

544
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:27,240
- Poor puppy.
- Poor puppy.

545
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:29,640
Only, it wouldn't be
a puppy anymore.

546
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:34,760
Watch out for the...

547
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:37,200
Oh, God.

548
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:41,240
- What was that?
- You swallowed the worm.

549
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:46,360
Well, I was trained to
swallow all sorts of things.

550
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:48,400
Careful. I may just
have to marry you.

551
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:18,720
- What's that?
- Just that normal male response.

552
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:21,520
No, I mean
under your shirt.

553
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:24,680
Oh, that. That's, uh...
That's your metal thing.

554
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:27,560
You had it?

555
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:29,720
You had this
the whole time?

556
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:33,320
The whole time I was talkin' about
my family and you... 
My poor little dog!

557
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:35,200
Yeah. I thought
it was important.

558
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:38,840
American!
Inconsiderate, uncultured...

559
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:44,480
Oh, good.

560
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:02,400
You can't be serious.
That is amazing.

561
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:04,320
What is that?
A flight chart?

562
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:06,840
Yeah. For a plane that
landed here last week.

563
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:09,440
With luck, it'll tell us
where that plane still is.

564
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:12,520
- What's so special about this plane?
- It's not the plane. It's...

565
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:14,560
- What's on board, right?
- Right.

566
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:27,440
Last coordinate is Cochise County Airport.
But it doesn't say where it's going next.

567
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:30,320
Once that plane takes off, it's
gone forever. We have to get there.

568
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:33,600
That's an airplane graveyard.
It's only five, six miles from here.

569
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:37,080
Great. If we run now, we'll
be there in an hour. Come on!

570
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:39,360
Run? I haven't
even stretched!

571
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:58,120
- Did you find her?
- No, I didn't find her. 
There's not a sign of her!

572
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:02,080
Call Cartagena. Tell 'em
we're comin' 12 hours earlier.

573
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:04,520
No, no! That's crazy!
She's not gonna go to the cops.

574
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:07,760
I say we get the hell outta here
and deliver on schedule tomorrow night!

575
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:11,600
Don't underestimate her! 
You understand?
She's smarter than you'll ever be!

576
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:17,520
Go. Go!

577
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:29,320
Why don't you tell me what we're
looking for. Maybe I can help.

578
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:31,520
- We're looking for a big plane.
- These are big planes!

579
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:35,400
- A 747200-C.
- They picked a good place to hide it.

580
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:41,720
Hey! There isn't, like, any
nuclear shit on this plane, is there?

581
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:46,960
Give me
the flashlight.

582
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:57,680
- Well?
- Yeah, this is it.

583
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:00,280
- Great.
- It's booby-trapped.

584
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:15,800
Is that something
dangerous?

585
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:17,440
Huh?

586
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:24,920
It smells like
old airline food in here.

587
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:31,320
Ahh! Oh! No!
Genuine dead people!

588
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:38,400
- Now what?
- What? A dead flight crew 
makes me very uncomfortable!

589
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:42,280
Level with me! 
Is this a nuclear thing?
This is a nuclear thing, isn't it?

590
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:46,400
Look, you don't have to come any closer.
In fact, you probably shouldn't.

591
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:50,920
- External genitalia are more susceptible.
- What? Susceptible to what?

592
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:55,640
- Here. Cover yourself with this.
- What is this?

593
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:59,320
- Use it as a testicular shield.
- Oh, come on.

594
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:01,440
"Come on" what?
I'm not joking.

595
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:05,800
Cover yourself.
And stay here. Don't move.

596
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:56,520
Well. Look at this.

597
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:58,560
I told you to wait!

598
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:01,800
Don't worry. I got my coffee-tron
dick defender.

599
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:04,360
I never said it was nuclear.
You just assumed.

600
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:09,360
- My, my, my, my, my!
- Put it back!

601
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:12,520
Do you mind? I spent ten years
chasing Russian gold.

602
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:15,200
Maybe it's not a medal around my neck,
but it still feels good.

603
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:18,400
Look, it's not mine, 
and it's certainly not yours. 
So put it back!

604
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:21,600
What? You don't think I've
earned it these past few days?

605
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:27,000
I think this deserves
an explanation.

606
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:33,400
This shipment was heading for
the gold reserve in Moscow.

607
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:35,560
The K.G.B.,
the K.G. used-to-be,

608
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:38,640
hijacked the plane
and flew it here.

609
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:41,920
It was Pinkwater's job
to find a buyer...

610
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:44,600
and change the gold into
hard currency... cash.

611
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:50,440
There's about
$600 million here for...

612
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:56,280
- My God! Oh, shit!
- Damn!

613
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:58,200
Come on! Let's go!

614
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,040
Welcome aboard,
ladies and gentlemen.

615
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:35,560
...certain safety features
of our Boeing 747.

616
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:39,240
We have several emergency exits
on either side of the aircraft.

617
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:42,640
I'm gonna check
on the gold!

618
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:45,480
Your seat belt has been designed
for easy fastening and release.

619
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:48,280
To fasten, insert the metal
strip into the buckle.

620
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:52,040
To release, lift up on the metal flap
on top of the buckle.

621
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:55,400
- Vlad, get up here!
- Your cabin is being pressurized for your...

622
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:57,880
- Ah!
- However, should there be 
a rapid change in pressure...

623
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,800
Let's go this way!
Come on! Quick!

624
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:05,880
Vlad! Vlad, there's someone
in the plane! Check the cockpit!

625
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:09,360
Place the oxygen mask
over your nose and mouth and secure...

626
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:11,280
Pilot escape hatch.

627
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:17,240
Oh, God.

628
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:19,120
If you are traveling
with infants or small...

629
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:26,960
Please be sure
to put your own...

630
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:36,600
And right now we just want you to sit
back, relax and enjoy your flight.

631
01:09:58,080 --> 01:09:59,880
We have to call
the F.B.I.

632
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
Money.

633
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:06,360
- Do you have a phone? - Mm-hmm.
Straight through that door in the lobby.

634
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:08,280
Do you have change
for two dollars?

635
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:12,920
- We really don't give change, but...
- Thanks.

636
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:22,600
- Hi.
- What can I get for you, young man?

637
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:25,240
- Some coffee, please.
- Cream and sugar?

638
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:27,520
- Black.
- Yes, sir. Comin' right up.

639
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:37,360
There you go.

640
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:58,760
Some special agent.

641
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:01,760
He said I had to drive all the way
to Phoenix to file the report in person.

642
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:04,200
Wouldn't even send
a goddamn field agent.

643
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:07,280
So, drive to Phoenix.
What's the big deal?

644
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:13,080
Those men came to the plane
for a reason, Ditch.

645
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:18,720
They're ready to move the gold. They
have a buyer! We gotta go back there.

646
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:21,920
No. No, wrong. Wrong.
I- I am not goin' back.

647
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:26,360
I'm not talking big heroics. All we have
to do is get their flight information.

648
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:28,320
It'd mean lives,
Ditch. Please.

649
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:31,760
You keep talkin' about all these lives
we're supposed to be saving.

650
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:33,680
What about my life, huh?

651
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:36,400
It's been circling the drain
for a few days now.

652
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:41,040
I'm out of business. I lost my car.
The F.A.A. still thinks I let you die.

653
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:44,200
For somebody I never slept with,
you sure fucked me pretty good.

654
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:49,920
Look. That gold was earmarked
to buy basic necessities.

655
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:54,560
Do you even know what's happening
in Russia? How close it is to collapse?

656
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:00,960
If the gold deal goes through, Pinkwater
and his comrades use the money...

657
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:04,160
to finance a coup
to take control!

658
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:06,680
And they're killers!
Just like Stalin was!

659
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:10,640
And thousands of people will die!
People like my family!

660
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:14,760
Yeah, people like your family.

661
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:19,080
I'm startin' to believe that maybe this
whole family thing is a bunch of bullshit!

662
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:22,080
Maybe you're workin' for yourself, tryin'
to scam your partners out of the gold.

663
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:24,000
I can't believe
you're saying that.

664
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:28,640
As for that little dog with three legs...
Wh-What was his name? Tripod?

665
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:32,680
I didn't say anything at the time because,
basically, I thought I was gonna get laid.

666
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:37,040
But couldn't you have come up with 
something a little stronger 
than a three-legged dog?

667
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:40,360
Oh, I see. You wanna believe
it's a lie, don't you,

668
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:42,880
because then you don't
have to do anything, right?

669
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:45,040
Pack the bags.
We're goin' on a guilt trip.

670
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:48,280
Those men are gangsters.

671
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:51,280
In Russia, they're into arms,
counterfeiting, contract kills!

672
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:53,920
That is Russia!
Not here!

673
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:58,440
But once they're in power,
it'll be the cold war all over again!

674
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:02,800
More missiles aimed at your country!
Is that what you want, Ditch?

675
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:05,760
Don't wave that flag at me,
because it's not gonna work.

676
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:08,040
Well, what does
work on you, Ditch?

677
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:13,080
I haven't been able
to figure that out.

678
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:15,560
What are you willing to
stick your neck out for, huh?

679
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:17,520
I'd really like to know!

680
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:20,560
You're using me. Just like
you used your roommate.

681
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:22,880
That's not fair.

682
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,560
But it's true, isn't it?

683
01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:28,920
You never wanted to help me
'cause you didn't give a shit about me!

684
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:32,320
- Admit it!
- Maybe not at first.

685
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:35,080
No. Not then.
Not now. Not ever.

686
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,040
Give me my wallet back.

687
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:02,920
So I'm the bad guy, right?

688
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:38,920
What do you got
for Desert City?

689
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:41,840
11:40 Phoenix bus
stops there. $5.50.

690
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:12,120
Hey! What do you have,
a death wish, buddy?

691
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:14,040
- Nice work, pal.
- Hey. Cool, dude. Thanks.

692
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:15,000
You're welcome.

693
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:23,960
Hey.

694
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:27,960
Got one just like it.

695
01:15:53,240 --> 01:15:55,880
Two more.

696
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:00,640
Keep it goin'.

697
01:16:03,080 --> 01:16:04,880
You got it.

698
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:55,480
Yo!

699
01:16:56,520 --> 01:16:59,520
- What's your name?
- Me? Chuck.

700
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:02,400
Brodie. F.A.A. I need you
to call the county sheriff.

701
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:06,000
Tell him there's a cargo jet out there that
just loaded up 1,000 keys of black tar heroin.

702
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:07,960
They're gettin' ready to take off,
so tell him to roll now!

703
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:10,560
Hey, you got
any proof that, uh...

704
01:17:10,680 --> 01:17:12,480
- What, you wanna see my I.D.?
- Yeah!

705
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:14,840
- I'll show it to you at the hearing.
- What hearing?

706
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:18,720
The one where we jerk your license for lettin'
this happen right under your nose, Chuck!

707
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:33,440
- You spoke to Cartegena?
- Of course. Just now.

708
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:35,920
- Everything's confirmed?
- Yes. He said the sooner the better.

709
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:40,400
- What's with the car?
- This is a Cadillac Allante. 
Northstar edition.

710
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:42,320
Double the horsepower.
They don't make 'em anymore.

711
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:44,320
It's an American
collectible classic.

712
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:48,040
Okay. Just put the ridiculous car
on the plane and then leave me alone.

713
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:49,960
It gets noticed.

714
01:17:52,720 --> 01:17:55,680
- What are you doing, Chuck?
- I'm enterin' my calling card PIN.

715
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:04,880
No. No!

716
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:07,920
- I'm on hold.
- No time for that.

717
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,840
- Raise your right hand.
- Wh-What for?

718
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:11,720
Federal emergency.
Now repeat after me.

719
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:15,080
- I do hereby solemnly swear.
- I do hereby solemnly swear.

720
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:23,000
I will honor,
observe and obey...

721
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:24,840
all the applicable rules
and regulations of the F.A.A.

722
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:27,280
all applicable rules and
regulations of the F.A.A.

723
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:32,440
- E pluribus unum.
- E pluribus unum.

724
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:34,720
Great. Okay, Deputy, you got
a spare chute somewhere?

725
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:38,120
- Deputy?
- Welcome aboard.

726
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:13,040
That lake, the one over 
the Indian reservation. 
What is it? San Carlos?

727
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:16,960
- How long 'til we're there?
- Another ten minutes. Why?

728
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:21,000
- I have to throw out some garbage.
- All right.

729
01:19:33,160 --> 01:19:35,360
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

730
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:37,280
I can't stop!

731
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:40,920
Lower! Slower!
Lower! Lower!

732
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:42,880
What the hell you doin'?

733
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:45,480
All right!

734
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:48,080
I'm gonna crawl out
onto the wing!

735
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:51,160
When I get stable, I'm gonna
give you a signal!

736
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:54,360
I want you to flip
this plane over!

737
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:56,320
Then I'm gonna
hang by my legs!

738
01:19:56,440 --> 01:20:00,360
So when you flip back over,
I'm sittin' on the other wing!

739
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:03,760
That way, when you maneuver
up to the other plane,

740
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:07,520
I'm in a better position
to grab on! You got it?

741
01:20:07,640 --> 01:20:09,440
Are you outta your mind?

742
01:20:10,520 --> 01:20:12,920
Yes. Yes, I am!

743
01:20:25,640 --> 01:20:28,440
Steady! Steady, okay?

744
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:36,320
I'm ready! Go!

745
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:40,280
Whoa!

746
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:50,760
All right,
Chuck! Now!

747
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:12,760
- Hey! Watch the paint job!
- Shut up!

748
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:22,760
I made you. I found you
and I trained you,

749
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:25,200
and you turn around
and you use it against me!

750
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:36,280
Krista. Krista.

751
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:38,240
There's no need for you
to die here today.

752
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:42,320
Look at me.
You are one of us.

753
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:51,400
All you have to do is tell me
the names of the people you told.

754
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:54,880
And tell me about
this Ditch Brodie.

755
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:06,320
Ah!

756
01:22:08,240 --> 01:22:10,720
You can have this money.
Some of it is yours.

757
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:18,920
Hey! Hey! We got company!
Get up here!

758
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,680
Put her in
the trunk! Oh!

759
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:27,400
- In the trunk! Come on. Come on!
- Get... Get in there!

760
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:33,280
Ah!

761
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:36,520
- What is it?
- It's a biplane.

762
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:42,480
It's Ditch.

763
01:22:42,520 --> 01:22:43,320
It's Ditch.

764
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:46,320
Shit!

765
01:22:57,080 --> 01:22:59,400
Get outta my car!

766
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:30,160
Give me your parachute!

767
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:54,160
Oh, shit!

768
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:00,240
Oh! Keys!

769
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:35,600
Don't worry! Come on!

770
01:24:51,640 --> 01:24:53,800
Ditch!

771
01:25:46,680 --> 01:25:49,840
We finally
got that tandem jump in!

772
01:25:59,440 --> 01:26:02,120
We're losin' hydraulic power!
I'm goin' backup.

773
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:49,680
Where ya goin'?

774
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:53,920
Woman, are you
outta your mind?

775
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:09,520
- Let it go. Let it go!
- What?

776
01:27:10,840 --> 01:27:12,680
I'm gonna take a nap.

777
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:14,640
Wake me when you're done
savin' the world, will ya?

778
01:27:34,720 --> 01:27:36,440
You'd make a great K.G.B. agent.

779
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:42,960
You're really courageous.
And you're really cute.

780
01:27:44,280 --> 01:27:46,080
You are.

781
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:16,320
Krista, you've done very well.
But then again,

782
01:28:16,440 --> 01:28:19,040
you always were
my favorite.

783
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:21,600
Hey, Ditch, look.

784
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:24,600
It's for you.

785
01:29:11,240 --> 01:29:12,560
Krista was more of a man
than you could ever be.

786
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:13,840
Krista was more of a man
than you could ever be.

787
01:30:06,240 --> 01:30:08,200
Ditch.

788
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:10,120
Ditch.

789
01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:16,600
I'm gonna... I'm gonna
get you outta here.

790
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:43,640
Hey, Jo. Robocam.

791
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:45,640
Guess what I got.

792
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:49,160
Check it out.
Postcard from Ditch.

793
01:30:49,240 --> 01:30:51,080
- No! Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.
- Really.

794
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:55,360
Come on, Jolleen,
read it.

795
01:30:55,480 --> 01:30:59,000
- Ha-ha! He made it!
- Hey, you guys, 
a postcard from Ditch.

796
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:02,040
- Postcard from Ditch.
- He made it, guys.

797
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:51,720
Mr. Richard Brodie.

798
01:31:51,880 --> 01:31:55,200
Mr. Richard Brodie.
Come.

799
01:32:04,240 --> 01:32:08,760
It's the first time we have
presented this medal to a foreigner.

800
01:32:08,840 --> 01:32:12,120
I do so with great pleasure.

801
01:32:15,200 --> 01:32:17,280
My, my, my, my, my.

802
01:32:18,520 --> 01:32:22,520
Buses here don't work.
I am an asshole.

803
01:32:27,360 --> 01:32:30,560
I think he made one jump too many.

804
01:32:35,360 --> 01:32:38,040
Thank you. Very cool.

805
01:32:41,160 --> 01:32:42,960
You look good
in Russian gold.

806
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:24,880
Hello. How are ya?
Hi, Mama. How are ya?

807
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:30,800
Uh, hey! Papa! Get that hand.
Good to see ya. Yes.

808
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:36,240
Hey-hey! I don't believe it!
Yes! Tripod?
