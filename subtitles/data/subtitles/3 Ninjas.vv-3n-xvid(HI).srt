Ah, two lessons you have to learn

Colt, what is a ninja?

118
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:37,057
A ninja is one who can use everything
around him to trick his enemies.

119
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:39,563
He is fast and he is friendly
to his environment.

120

A ninja is honest and good.

121
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:44,435
His mind, body and spirit are one.

122
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:47,301
He has self-control.
He has discipline.

123
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,364
A ninja loves nature, uh...

124
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:52,570
'cause he's part of nature.

125

Uh, a ninja never <i>f</i>ights a battle
if he cannot win.

126

A ninja... mind, body...

spirit, heart are one.
